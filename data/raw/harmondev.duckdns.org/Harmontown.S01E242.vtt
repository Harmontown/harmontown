WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:26.680
It's a very last show that we're going to do here with a lump in my throat is my honor

00:26.680 --> 00:36.680
to tell you that Harmontown is now in social with a lump in my pants this thing has spent

00:36.680 --> 01:06.580
a durable and reliable bar.

01:06.580 --> 01:08.580
Thank you very much.

01:08.580 --> 01:10.580
Thank you.

01:10.580 --> 01:11.580
Thank you.

01:11.580 --> 01:12.580
Wow.

01:12.580 --> 01:13.580
What a welcome.

01:13.580 --> 01:14.580
And thank you and goodbye.

01:14.580 --> 01:15.580
Goodbye.

01:15.580 --> 01:16.580
Right?

01:16.580 --> 01:17.580
Goodbye.

01:17.580 --> 01:18.580
Let's do a show first.

01:18.580 --> 01:22.580
We're doing one last show here at Meltdown, which has been our...

01:22.580 --> 01:27.580
Rob Schwab!

01:27.580 --> 01:30.580
What?!

01:30.580 --> 01:37.580
Yeah!

01:37.580 --> 01:41.580
Rob, an unheralded Rob Schwab.

01:41.580 --> 01:46.580
He's rolling up his shirt sleeves like Roddy Piper is...

01:46.580 --> 01:49.580
Pulling a spring steam!

01:49.580 --> 01:52.580
He's doing a Popeye dance.

01:52.580 --> 01:54.580
Hello, Rob.

01:54.580 --> 01:57.580
Hello, Daniel.

01:57.580 --> 02:00.580
Anyways, this was our birthplace in our home for five years.

02:00.580 --> 02:01.580
Six years?

02:01.580 --> 02:08.580
It says 2011 on what Camille pointed out was a shitty flag last week.

02:08.580 --> 02:11.580
So six years, really.

02:11.580 --> 02:12.580
Somehow.

02:12.580 --> 02:13.580
It feels like 11.

02:13.580 --> 02:14.580
I'm not joking.

02:14.580 --> 02:15.580
It feels like...

02:15.580 --> 02:22.580
Steve, never touch me.

02:22.580 --> 02:26.580
We spoke about this before the show, Steve.

02:26.580 --> 02:27.580
Don't touch...

02:27.580 --> 02:28.580
Oh, you...

02:28.580 --> 02:32.580
I can't hit you, Levy.

02:32.580 --> 02:35.580
You just said not to do that.

02:35.580 --> 02:36.580
I know.

02:36.580 --> 02:37.580
Then you did it.

02:37.580 --> 02:38.580
You did it.

02:38.580 --> 02:39.580
I know.

02:39.580 --> 02:43.580
We have a weird role-playing thing where I tell him one thing and he hugs me.

02:43.580 --> 02:44.580
All right, so...

02:44.580 --> 02:50.580
Oh, I thought very much, fucking nice bucket.

02:50.580 --> 02:52.580
He's just dancing.

02:52.580 --> 02:57.580
Oh, shit.

02:57.580 --> 02:59.580
This shows...

02:59.580 --> 03:05.580
You guys know that this isn't mostly an audio podcast, right?

03:05.580 --> 03:11.580
We've been here for six years, Steve.

03:11.580 --> 03:21.580
It's like the opening credits of Good Times over there.

03:21.580 --> 03:31.580
So I tried to watch...

03:31.580 --> 03:32.580
I started...

03:32.580 --> 03:36.580
I watched the ring, too, tonight.

03:36.580 --> 03:39.580
Only because I wanted to watch rings.

03:39.580 --> 03:41.580
And I didn't want to...

03:41.580 --> 03:44.580
It seemed stupid, but I was like, yeah, I didn't want to...

03:44.580 --> 03:45.580
I was like, what did I forget?

03:45.580 --> 03:47.580
I almost wanted to watch the last 20 minutes of the ring,

03:47.580 --> 03:50.580
but instead I read the Wikipedia entry for the ring.

03:50.580 --> 03:52.580
It was still confusing.

03:52.580 --> 03:54.580
Is there actually a ring?

03:54.580 --> 03:56.580
They call it the ring.

03:56.580 --> 03:58.580
Is there only one ring?

03:58.580 --> 04:01.580
Is there a ring in the movie?

04:01.580 --> 04:02.580
No, there's...

04:02.580 --> 04:04.580
Isn't it a tape?

04:04.580 --> 04:05.580
Yeah.

04:05.580 --> 04:07.580
You're talking about Lord of the Rings.

04:07.580 --> 04:09.580
I was referencing that.

04:09.580 --> 04:12.580
The ring is a ring of light that turns out to be...

04:12.580 --> 04:15.580
At the end of the first movie,

04:15.580 --> 04:18.580
turns out to be the view from the bottom of a well.

04:18.580 --> 04:20.580
That's important because it's one of those horror movies

04:20.580 --> 04:22.580
where you spend 90 minutes going,

04:22.580 --> 04:24.580
ooh, creepy.

04:24.580 --> 04:26.580
Mostly creepy because, ooh, why?

04:26.580 --> 04:27.580
What's going on?

04:27.580 --> 04:28.580
Why a lighthouse?

04:28.580 --> 04:30.580
Why a horse?

04:30.580 --> 04:32.580
And then someone, inevitably in those movies,

04:32.580 --> 04:34.580
it's all fine and dandy.

04:34.580 --> 04:36.580
When it's like buying on credit, you go,

04:36.580 --> 04:39.580
okay, and she was a psychic girl

04:39.580 --> 04:41.580
that lived under a lighthouse and killed horses.

04:41.580 --> 04:44.580
Okay, the whole crazy movie makes sense.

04:44.580 --> 04:46.580
It's a ring of light from a well.

04:46.580 --> 04:48.580
End of movie.

04:48.580 --> 04:49.580
Go home.

04:49.580 --> 04:50.580
That was fun.

04:50.580 --> 04:52.580
I liked how she crawled.

04:52.580 --> 04:54.580
$450 million.

04:54.580 --> 04:56.580
It cost $30 million to make or whatever.

04:56.580 --> 04:58.580
So guess what?

04:58.580 --> 05:01.580
Do you think anybody working on the second ring movie?

05:01.580 --> 05:02.580
Anybody.

05:02.580 --> 05:03.580
I don't care.

05:03.580 --> 05:04.580
Katerer.

05:04.580 --> 05:05.580
Anybody.

05:05.580 --> 05:07.580
Do you think anybody was, like,

05:07.580 --> 05:09.580
seriously plus this is going to be, like,

05:09.580 --> 05:12.580
the better of the two ring movies?

05:12.580 --> 05:14.580
Because we're...

05:14.580 --> 05:17.580
I spent the whole time watching the ring, too,

05:17.580 --> 05:20.580
saying to Cody, like, you know, this is awful.

05:20.580 --> 05:22.580
Like, this isn't even bad for a ring sequel.

05:22.580 --> 05:24.580
Like, I thought it would be bad,

05:24.580 --> 05:26.580
but I thought it would be fun bad, like,

05:26.580 --> 05:28.580
the relationship between sequels should be kind of like,

05:28.580 --> 05:30.580
oh, the first movie's called, like,

05:30.580 --> 05:33.580
Tap Dancing Cat, and then the sequel should be, like...

05:33.580 --> 05:35.580
Did you think, like, you think, like,

05:35.580 --> 05:37.580
the tape, there was going to be more tapes?

05:37.580 --> 05:38.580
Yeah.

05:38.580 --> 05:41.580
Like Hellraiser 3, they all would have been coming down the street,

05:41.580 --> 05:43.580
like, coming after you, like, the tapes?

05:43.580 --> 05:45.580
I thought they would do stuff, like,

05:45.580 --> 05:47.580
yeah, they would dig in a little bit.

05:47.580 --> 05:50.580
Like, the protagonist would work at a VCR repair shop.

05:50.580 --> 05:51.580
Right.

05:51.580 --> 05:52.580
Like, there are things.

05:52.580 --> 05:55.580
So, it turns out, that's the third one.

05:55.580 --> 05:57.580
Still a bad idea.

05:57.580 --> 05:58.580
Yeah.

05:58.580 --> 06:01.580
Like, I wrote Rings 3 while I was watching Rings 2,

06:01.580 --> 06:03.580
and Rings 3 is still bad.

06:03.580 --> 06:05.580
Like, if I had written it, still bad.

06:05.580 --> 06:07.580
Did you ever see The Grudge?

06:07.580 --> 06:10.580
I never saw The Grudge, because I figured it was the same.

06:10.580 --> 06:13.580
I'm not, you know, it's like, it would be like,

06:13.580 --> 06:15.580
Nightmare on Elm Street, and then doing, like,

06:15.580 --> 06:16.580
Weekend at Freddy's.

06:16.580 --> 06:19.580
Well, The Grudge is, there's,

06:19.580 --> 06:21.580
correct me if I'm wrong, like, there's, like,

06:21.580 --> 06:23.580
an apartment that there was a murder in,

06:23.580 --> 06:25.580
or a home that was a murder in.

06:25.580 --> 06:27.580
A murder of a girl that looks through her bangs.

06:27.580 --> 06:28.580
Right.

06:28.580 --> 06:29.580
And...

06:29.580 --> 06:30.580
And who drifts.

06:30.580 --> 06:33.580
And anybody that goes to that apartment,

06:33.580 --> 06:35.580
gets cursed, and then...

06:35.580 --> 06:38.580
So killed that their face is scary.

06:38.580 --> 06:39.580
Yeah.

06:39.580 --> 06:41.580
There's a through line of all the movies.

06:41.580 --> 06:44.580
There's ring movies that don't have videotape in them,

06:44.580 --> 06:47.580
but they all, somebody thought that the through line was,

06:47.580 --> 06:49.580
was the scary face that,

06:49.580 --> 06:51.580
what Cody and I were calling the EFF,

06:51.580 --> 06:53.580
the extreme fear face.

06:53.580 --> 06:55.580
What's her name?

06:55.580 --> 06:56.580
Nan Tuckett?

06:56.580 --> 06:57.580
Ashley Judd?

06:57.580 --> 06:58.580
What's her name?

06:58.580 --> 06:59.580
Winona Judd?

06:59.580 --> 07:01.580
Judd Ryder?

07:01.580 --> 07:03.580
Naomi Watkins?

07:03.580 --> 07:05.580
She goes into an ambulance.

07:05.580 --> 07:07.580
Judd Reinhold.

07:07.580 --> 07:09.580
She recorded the tape,

07:09.580 --> 07:11.580
so that she could save her kid's life,

07:11.580 --> 07:13.580
and she, like, gives, ostensibly,

07:13.580 --> 07:15.580
between the two movies, something they never address.

07:15.580 --> 07:17.580
She must have grabbed a drifter,

07:17.580 --> 07:19.580
or a cancer patient, or a prisoner,

07:19.580 --> 07:21.580
and said, hey, watch this.

07:21.580 --> 07:22.580
Bye!

07:22.580 --> 07:25.580
And thereby saving the life of her child, Aiden,

07:25.580 --> 07:27.580
which she pronounces with a Schrodinger's H.

07:27.580 --> 07:28.580
Hey, Aiden.

07:28.580 --> 07:30.580
Hey, is it Hayden?

07:30.580 --> 07:31.580
I turned down the subtitles.

07:31.580 --> 07:32.580
It's Aiden.

07:32.580 --> 07:33.580
Why doesn't...

07:33.580 --> 07:34.580
I mean, it's all the actress.

07:34.580 --> 07:36.580
You turned down the subtitles to find that out?

07:36.580 --> 07:39.580
Anyways, yes, I did.

07:39.580 --> 07:40.580
You gotta turn them up.

07:40.580 --> 07:42.580
You gotta turn those subtitles up

07:42.580 --> 07:43.580
so you can hear that H.

07:43.580 --> 07:45.580
I like to keep them at, kind of, a medium level.

07:45.580 --> 07:47.580
I like the subtitles to be, kind of,

07:47.580 --> 07:49.580
like, 50% percent.

07:49.580 --> 07:51.580
So, but anyway,

07:51.580 --> 07:53.580
did you know that they had,

07:53.580 --> 07:56.580
they had grudge versus the ring?

07:56.580 --> 07:57.580
Grudge versus the ring?

07:57.580 --> 07:59.580
Yeah, somebody takes the videotape

07:59.580 --> 08:01.580
to the grudge apartment

08:01.580 --> 08:03.580
and plays the videotape in there.

08:03.580 --> 08:05.580
Wait, is this at the end of the grudge?

08:05.580 --> 08:07.580
Or is this, like, a different movie?

08:07.580 --> 08:08.580
Is it a different movie?

08:08.580 --> 08:09.580
Like, grudge versus ring?

08:09.580 --> 08:10.580
Requiem?

08:10.580 --> 08:11.580
Yeah, like, it just happened,

08:11.580 --> 08:13.580
it just happened, like, last year.

08:13.580 --> 08:16.580
They actually had the girl from the ring,

08:16.580 --> 08:18.580
like, throw out the first pitch

08:18.580 --> 08:20.580
at a baseball game.

08:20.580 --> 08:22.580
Like, she's like, oh, like this?

08:22.580 --> 08:24.580
And she's like, throw this out?

08:24.580 --> 08:26.580
You can find it online.

08:26.580 --> 08:28.580
But we should watch that

08:28.580 --> 08:29.580
at our next Hangout,

08:29.580 --> 08:31.580
grudge versus ring.

08:31.580 --> 08:34.580
You know, I can't tell which part is a bit.

08:34.580 --> 08:36.580
Like, I don't know what...

08:36.580 --> 08:38.580
Did they do a grudge versus ring at all?

08:38.580 --> 08:40.580
The part where you come to the Hangout.

08:40.580 --> 08:41.580
Yeah.

08:41.580 --> 08:43.580
That's the bit.

08:43.580 --> 08:44.580
Yeah!

08:44.580 --> 08:45.580
Oh!

08:45.580 --> 08:47.580
Oh, freak out!

08:47.580 --> 08:48.580
Dab, dab, dab, dab, dab, dab, dab.

08:48.580 --> 08:50.580
Say, shake, to freak!

08:50.580 --> 08:53.580
Anyways, it's just an available on Shutter.

08:53.580 --> 08:55.580
It's only available on Shutter.

08:55.580 --> 08:57.580
It's only available on Shutter, Dan.

08:57.580 --> 08:58.580
It's only available on...

08:58.580 --> 09:01.580
The guy from Big Bang Theory

09:01.580 --> 09:03.580
is in the third ring movie.

09:03.580 --> 09:05.580
And what is the guy from what?

09:05.580 --> 09:07.580
The guy from Big Bang Theory.

09:07.580 --> 09:09.580
The guy that's not the guy.

09:09.580 --> 09:10.580
Francis Bang?

09:10.580 --> 09:11.580
Yeah.

09:16.580 --> 09:20.580
Is one of the characters named Bang?

09:20.580 --> 09:22.580
Alright, I'm looking at this.

09:22.580 --> 09:24.580
Hi, I'm gonna be big one day,

09:24.580 --> 09:26.580
and this is my theory.

09:26.580 --> 09:28.580
I was trying...

09:28.580 --> 09:31.580
You guys all drive the same way over here, right?

09:31.580 --> 09:33.580
Did you pass a building today

09:33.580 --> 09:36.580
with a giant LED sign on it?

09:36.580 --> 09:39.580
One of those standard red LED displays

09:39.580 --> 09:41.580
that just says Frank Stallone?

09:41.580 --> 09:42.580
No.

09:42.580 --> 09:43.580
No.

09:43.580 --> 09:45.580
I really want to know what's going on in that building.

09:45.580 --> 09:47.580
I kept looking back.

09:47.580 --> 09:50.580
I was like, Frank Stallone, what?

09:50.580 --> 09:52.580
Slept here?

09:52.580 --> 09:54.580
Is it his birthday?

09:54.580 --> 09:55.580
Is coming?

09:55.580 --> 09:57.580
Owens this building?

09:57.580 --> 09:59.580
Is driving an SUV?

09:59.580 --> 10:01.580
Amber Alert?

10:03.580 --> 10:04.580
Frank Stallone?

10:04.580 --> 10:05.580
Keep going.

10:07.580 --> 10:10.580
Was it a cafeteria for aliens?

10:10.580 --> 10:12.580
And he's on the menu?

10:14.580 --> 10:17.580
Do three more and we'll let you have the hook.

10:19.580 --> 10:23.580
Is it his turn to get his driver's license?

10:23.580 --> 10:25.580
Two more?

10:25.580 --> 10:29.580
Is he...

10:29.580 --> 10:31.580
That's one.

10:34.580 --> 10:37.580
Was he the answer to a trivia question

10:37.580 --> 10:39.580
in a jury pool waiting room?

10:39.580 --> 10:41.580
I have the third one.

10:41.580 --> 10:43.580
Does he know Mitch Hurwitz?

10:43.580 --> 10:45.580
Oh, shit!

10:49.580 --> 10:51.580
Oh, whoa!

10:51.580 --> 10:53.580
Oh, yeah!

10:53.580 --> 10:55.580
Yeah!

10:55.580 --> 10:57.580
Yeah!

10:57.580 --> 10:59.580
Yeah!

11:07.580 --> 11:10.580
All right, let's grind this thing to a halt.

11:10.580 --> 11:11.580
Do it.

11:11.580 --> 11:13.580
No, no, it'll pick up now.

11:13.580 --> 11:15.580
I couldn't hear. I missed the thread.

11:15.580 --> 11:17.580
Mitch, we haven't seen you in a thousand years.

11:17.580 --> 11:19.580
How are you doing, baby?

11:19.580 --> 11:21.580
Is this how it's going to be all night?

11:21.580 --> 11:23.580
I mean, I don't know.

11:23.580 --> 11:25.580
I'm just saying we missed you. We love you.

11:25.580 --> 11:27.580
It's good to see you.

11:27.580 --> 11:29.580
Yeah, thank you. It's so nice to be here.

11:29.580 --> 11:31.580
You internalize that in a strange way,

11:31.580 --> 11:33.580
but my compliment still stands at the test of time.

11:33.580 --> 11:35.580
You're what?

11:35.580 --> 11:37.580
I'm on board.

11:37.580 --> 11:39.580
Is this your last show?

11:39.580 --> 11:41.580
Yeah, here at this location.

11:41.580 --> 11:43.580
Sorry, he can't stick around. Let's hear from Mitch Hurwitz.

11:43.580 --> 11:45.580
Good to see you.

11:45.580 --> 11:47.580
Have you met Brandon?

11:47.580 --> 11:49.580
You probably haven't met Brandon.

11:49.580 --> 11:51.580
Well, just briefly coming in.

11:51.580 --> 11:53.580
Great to see you.

11:53.580 --> 11:55.580
Thank you. Just get closer to the mic when you...

11:57.580 --> 11:59.580
Hey, Brandon.

11:59.580 --> 12:01.580
He's in a combative mode right now.

12:01.580 --> 12:03.580
He's a little combative.

12:03.580 --> 12:05.580
I saw that. I'm edgy.

12:05.580 --> 12:07.580
It's all right.

12:07.580 --> 12:09.580
How's it going at Netflix?

12:09.580 --> 12:11.580
Well, really good.

12:11.580 --> 12:13.580
I don't know if you saw yesterday.

12:13.580 --> 12:15.580
They used to say drop.

12:15.580 --> 12:17.580
Now it's called dump.

12:17.580 --> 12:19.580
They dumped 25 new shows.

12:19.580 --> 12:21.580
Gross.

12:21.580 --> 12:23.580
And they're dumping 13 more tomorrow.

12:23.580 --> 12:25.580
So it's going to be...

12:25.580 --> 12:27.580
Have you ever gotten...

12:27.580 --> 12:29.580
Do you get this for your consideration packages?

12:29.580 --> 12:31.580
Sometimes you open one.

12:31.580 --> 12:33.580
And these days it's just a rabbit hole

12:33.580 --> 12:35.580
of despair about peak TV.

12:35.580 --> 12:37.580
There's Donald Sutherland's

12:37.580 --> 12:39.580
in a Diamond Heist series.

12:39.580 --> 12:41.580
And the studio that makes it

12:41.580 --> 12:43.580
thinks you should bear it in mind

12:43.580 --> 12:45.580
when you vote for the Emmys.

12:45.580 --> 12:47.580
I've never heard of this fucking show.

12:47.580 --> 12:49.580
On the audience.

12:49.580 --> 12:51.580
You get a book of this big, heavy book.

12:51.580 --> 12:53.580
Usually it's like in Loose Sight.

12:53.580 --> 12:55.580
You take this thing that must cost $80.

12:55.580 --> 12:57.580
Just put it gently into the wastebasket.

12:57.580 --> 12:59.580
Yeah.

12:59.580 --> 13:01.580
John Landgraf had, like,

13:01.580 --> 13:03.580
you know, had raised

13:03.580 --> 13:05.580
mild Twitter controversy

13:05.580 --> 13:07.580
by saying the phrase peak TV.

13:07.580 --> 13:09.580
There might be too much TV to enjoy.

13:09.580 --> 13:11.580
There's too much TV to watch.

13:11.580 --> 13:13.580
To know exists.

13:13.580 --> 13:15.580
You feel like you're on an international flight.

13:15.580 --> 13:17.580
You know, watching shows that you're just like,

13:17.580 --> 13:19.580
is this in Canada?

13:19.580 --> 13:21.580
And then...

13:21.580 --> 13:23.580
And then you walk in and you're like,

13:23.580 --> 13:25.580
I'm in the show and I don't even remember...

13:25.580 --> 13:27.580
Like half of my friends here.

13:27.580 --> 13:29.580
You know, I'm a big Bosch nut.

13:29.580 --> 13:31.580
A lot of Bosch fans.

13:31.580 --> 13:33.580
Heronimus?

13:33.580 --> 13:35.580
Does he have a show on audience?

13:35.580 --> 13:37.580
It might be Heronimus.

13:37.580 --> 13:39.580
Fuck or die.

13:39.580 --> 13:41.580
The Bounty Hunter?

13:41.580 --> 13:43.580
Is that what he's doing?

13:43.580 --> 13:45.580
There's a Bounty Hunter named Bosch.

13:45.580 --> 13:47.580
I think it's a different Bosch.

13:47.580 --> 13:49.580
God damn it.

13:49.580 --> 13:51.580
The poster of a guy,

13:51.580 --> 13:53.580
you know, like an older...

13:53.580 --> 13:55.580
Is it I.T.89?

13:55.580 --> 13:57.580
Bosch.

13:57.580 --> 13:59.580
Season eight.

13:59.580 --> 14:01.580
Four episodes.

14:01.580 --> 14:03.580
Have you seen this show,

14:03.580 --> 14:05.580
what's it called, Forever or Memorable?

14:05.580 --> 14:07.580
Obviously not the latter.

14:07.580 --> 14:09.580
Or Immortal or

14:09.580 --> 14:11.580
A Long Time or Remember Me or

14:11.580 --> 14:13.580
What's that?

14:13.580 --> 14:15.580
Yeah, vinyl.

14:15.580 --> 14:17.580
It's not vinyl, sir.

14:17.580 --> 14:19.580
There's a wood or leather.

14:19.580 --> 14:21.580
It was a material of some sort.

14:21.580 --> 14:23.580
Who knows?

14:23.580 --> 14:25.580
It's called like Memorable Forever-ish or something.

14:25.580 --> 14:27.580
Welcome back, Connor.

14:27.580 --> 14:29.580
The show is Highlander Without Swords.

14:29.580 --> 14:31.580
It's just a guy that lives forever

14:31.580 --> 14:33.580
and Judd Hirsch is like

14:33.580 --> 14:35.580
his son,

14:35.580 --> 14:37.580
biologically his grandpa.

14:37.580 --> 14:39.580
He's poor.

14:39.580 --> 14:41.580
Whenever he dies,

14:41.580 --> 14:43.580
he wakes up in the Hudson River.

14:43.580 --> 14:45.580
Because they couldn't...

14:45.580 --> 14:47.580
He's immortal, but he can't just be immortal.

14:47.580 --> 14:49.580
So he has to die and then his body

14:49.580 --> 14:51.580
disappears and then he wakes up

14:51.580 --> 14:53.580
in a river.

14:53.580 --> 14:55.580
But he works at a pathology lab

14:55.580 --> 14:57.580
because he wants to work closely

14:57.580 --> 14:59.580
with death because he wants to

14:59.580 --> 15:01.580
die.

15:01.580 --> 15:03.580
So he wants to study it, which makes him

15:03.580 --> 15:05.580
pretty handy at helping solve

15:05.580 --> 15:07.580
sexy lady murders.

15:07.580 --> 15:09.580
When the sexy lady

15:09.580 --> 15:11.580
can't solve every murder by herself

15:11.580 --> 15:13.580
as strong and as fierce as she is.

15:13.580 --> 15:15.580
As little guff as she takes

15:15.580 --> 15:17.580
from the department, this creepy immortal man.

15:19.580 --> 15:21.580
Meanwhile, the writing room at river

15:21.580 --> 15:23.580
is saying like, that's our

15:23.580 --> 15:25.580
season-ender.

15:25.580 --> 15:27.580
And at least it's a tiny river.

15:27.580 --> 15:29.580
There's a show called River.

15:29.580 --> 15:31.580
It's like watching TV in Canada.

15:31.580 --> 15:33.580
It really...

15:33.580 --> 15:35.580
And everything is shot in Canada.

15:35.580 --> 15:37.580
It looks like America, but

15:37.580 --> 15:39.580
the stop sign is perfectly round

15:39.580 --> 15:41.580
in the background.

15:41.580 --> 15:43.580
Whenever someone says

15:43.580 --> 15:45.580
the police are coming, you're like,

15:45.580 --> 15:47.580
the police are coming. That sounds like a rave.

15:47.580 --> 15:49.580
They're like...

15:49.580 --> 15:51.580
That's not a police siren.

15:51.580 --> 15:53.580
That doesn't affect me emotionally at all.

15:53.580 --> 15:55.580
It doesn't sound like anyone's in trouble.

15:55.580 --> 15:57.580
It sounds like

15:57.580 --> 15:59.580
the police are about to be handed out.

15:59.580 --> 16:01.580
You know, the...

16:01.580 --> 16:03.580
So you're dying? Why is this the last...

16:03.580 --> 16:05.580
Maybe I missed that part.

16:05.580 --> 16:07.580
I heard big laughs and I thought, oh god,

16:07.580 --> 16:09.580
Dan's dying.

16:09.580 --> 16:11.580
No, we're just...

16:11.580 --> 16:13.580
We're going to move into

16:13.580 --> 16:15.580
a different venue.

16:15.580 --> 16:17.580
We found out the owner of NerdMelt Comics

16:17.580 --> 16:19.580
is a big Trump supporter, so we said...

16:19.580 --> 16:21.580
Fuck this shit.

16:21.580 --> 16:23.580
Every comic book you buy

16:23.580 --> 16:25.580
goes to ICE.

16:25.580 --> 16:27.580
It goes to deporting Mexicans.

16:27.580 --> 16:29.580
You may as well

16:29.580 --> 16:31.580
be doing it yourself if you're really into...

16:31.580 --> 16:33.580
You love comic books so much

16:33.580 --> 16:35.580
that you might as well just say,

16:35.580 --> 16:37.580
I hate Mexican people.

16:37.580 --> 16:39.580
Anything by Garth Ennis? Double it.

16:39.580 --> 16:41.580
It's like the more cool

16:41.580 --> 16:43.580
and smart the comic, the more

16:43.580 --> 16:45.580
Mexicans you're helping deport.

16:45.580 --> 16:47.580
Hey, what about this Bill O'Reilly, man?

16:47.580 --> 16:49.580
Huh?

16:49.580 --> 16:51.580
Woo!

16:51.580 --> 16:53.580
I know, man. How you doing?

16:53.580 --> 16:55.580
We're back here in the dark.

16:55.580 --> 16:57.580
It's a special Rob Schrab

16:57.580 --> 16:59.580
Topical Corner moment.

17:01.580 --> 17:03.580
Topical Corner!

17:03.580 --> 17:05.580
Hey, hey, Spencer.

17:05.580 --> 17:07.580
Hey, what's up?

17:07.580 --> 17:09.580
Let's crack into this.

17:09.580 --> 17:11.580
Well, you know, Bill O'Reilly

17:11.580 --> 17:13.580
rubs a lot of people the wrong way.

17:13.580 --> 17:15.580
Which way does he rub you?

17:15.580 --> 17:17.580
Oh...

17:19.580 --> 17:21.580
Did I say something clever or was it terrible?

17:21.580 --> 17:23.580
He literally

17:23.580 --> 17:25.580
rubs people.

17:25.580 --> 17:27.580
The wrong way.

17:27.580 --> 17:29.580
Say what you will about Bill O'Reilly.

17:29.580 --> 17:31.580
I think it's very impressive that he's refused

17:31.580 --> 17:33.580
to learn anything.

17:33.580 --> 17:35.580
They keep giving him millions of dollars.

17:35.580 --> 17:37.580
I've learned nothing.

17:37.580 --> 17:39.580
Nothing is different. Everybody else is wrong.

17:39.580 --> 17:41.580
Don't worry about me.

17:41.580 --> 17:43.580
It's weird because he came off to me.

17:43.580 --> 17:45.580
He came off so laid back.

17:45.580 --> 17:47.580
It's weird

17:47.580 --> 17:51.580
to find out that he was a tense overreaching asshole.

17:51.580 --> 17:53.580
Do you draw any

17:53.580 --> 17:55.580
comfort when you hear about these

17:55.580 --> 17:57.580
old guys, the baby boomers

17:57.580 --> 17:59.580
that have their little sexual

17:59.580 --> 18:01.580
scandals? Do you ever in the back of your head

18:01.580 --> 18:03.580
go, well, at least I thought

18:03.580 --> 18:05.580
your dick's not working.

18:05.580 --> 18:07.580
And you're kind of like, well...

18:07.580 --> 18:09.580
As you know, I'm a sexual

18:09.580 --> 18:11.580
harranger.

18:11.580 --> 18:13.580
And we hate harassers.

18:13.580 --> 18:15.580
Oh, okay.

18:15.580 --> 18:17.580
Get in and get out.

18:17.580 --> 18:19.580
Harrangers, we sort of stay on it, you know what I mean?

18:19.580 --> 18:21.580
We cultivate it.

18:21.580 --> 18:23.580
You put it in the work.

18:23.580 --> 18:25.580
Say what you want about the work.

18:25.580 --> 18:27.580
Maybe it's not for you.

18:27.580 --> 18:29.580
But we're there every day

18:29.580 --> 18:31.580
saying, I'm serious.

18:31.580 --> 18:33.580
You look like...

18:33.580 --> 18:35.580
My favorite beverage is hot chocolate.

18:35.580 --> 18:37.580
I know I said it yesterday in passing,

18:37.580 --> 18:39.580
but stay on it.

18:39.580 --> 18:41.580
We tell you daily, Mitch,

18:41.580 --> 18:43.580
please stop saying that.

18:43.580 --> 18:45.580
I'm a harranger, I can't...

18:45.580 --> 18:47.580
A sexual harranger is someone who stays

18:47.580 --> 18:49.580
just on this side of the

18:49.580 --> 18:51.580
lawsuit and legal line of harassment.

18:51.580 --> 18:53.580
They're just... Absolutely.

18:53.580 --> 18:55.580
It's a personality defect.

18:55.580 --> 18:57.580
Hey, I just really enjoy working with you.

18:57.580 --> 18:59.580
I know you do. And I can tell

18:59.580 --> 19:01.580
you want to fuck me.

19:01.580 --> 19:03.580
It's the craziest thing, although I will say

19:03.580 --> 19:05.580
I go out of my way now

19:05.580 --> 19:07.580
almost not to look at people

19:07.580 --> 19:09.580
and talk... It is

19:09.580 --> 19:11.580
very hard. Let me just make the case

19:11.580 --> 19:13.580
from Bill's point of view.

19:13.580 --> 19:15.580
And I don't know, maybe...

19:15.580 --> 19:17.580
Maybe this won't be met with a lot of...

19:17.580 --> 19:19.580
Hear him out, hear him out.

19:19.580 --> 19:21.580
Hear me out. Especially you.

19:21.580 --> 19:23.580
I'm not going to...

19:25.580 --> 19:27.580
I'm not going to use the T word.

19:27.580 --> 19:29.580
This story is why he's on Netflix now.

19:29.580 --> 19:31.580
That's right. I'm doing

19:31.580 --> 19:33.580
three episodes of Moon

19:33.580 --> 19:35.580
that comes out. Three episodes

19:35.580 --> 19:37.580
season one. Season two is just

19:37.580 --> 19:39.580
two episodes.

19:39.580 --> 19:41.580
I think

19:41.580 --> 19:43.580
it is hard for us not

19:43.580 --> 19:45.580
to comment on each other's

19:45.580 --> 19:47.580
physicality. Like, I want to come out

19:47.580 --> 19:49.580
and say, like, oh, a suit.

19:49.580 --> 19:51.580
What do you mean suit?

19:51.580 --> 19:53.580
Okay, all right.

19:53.580 --> 19:55.580
It is so...

19:55.580 --> 19:57.580
Wow. The goddamn wrangers.

19:57.580 --> 19:59.580
Let it go.

19:59.580 --> 20:01.580
Well, I just show up. I don't let it go.

20:01.580 --> 20:03.580
I mean, I would have started with black, but that's...

20:03.580 --> 20:07.580
That's all I see.

20:09.580 --> 20:11.580
Race and then gender in that order.

20:11.580 --> 20:13.580
Yeah.

20:13.580 --> 20:15.580
Because I can let your race go if you're a man.

20:15.580 --> 20:17.580
Well,

20:17.580 --> 20:19.580
as you know, I'm sort of famously

20:19.580 --> 20:21.580
colorblind, but

20:21.580 --> 20:23.580
I'm not going to take any shit from some blue guy.

20:23.580 --> 20:25.580
What?

20:25.580 --> 20:27.580
What? Did I get it wrong?

20:27.580 --> 20:29.580
Either way I lose.

20:29.580 --> 20:33.580
From black to blue, the Brandon Johnson story.

20:33.580 --> 20:35.580
Blue like meat.

20:35.580 --> 20:39.580
Call me a motherfucking smurf.

20:39.580 --> 20:41.580
I want to call the black and blue.

20:41.580 --> 20:43.580
No, it's thrilling to see him go down.

20:43.580 --> 20:45.580
And then you have to worry that you're just liking it

20:45.580 --> 20:47.580
because you're just seeing somebody get there

20:47.580 --> 20:49.580
come up and see, you know, you have to kind of...

20:49.580 --> 20:51.580
And also kind of to travel about it.

20:51.580 --> 20:53.580
But he's just so happy to see.

20:53.580 --> 20:55.580
And it's just constantly frustrating that

20:55.580 --> 20:57.580
they'd never learn.

20:57.580 --> 20:59.580
I think what's maddening about the Trump thing

20:59.580 --> 21:01.580
is you keep waiting for him to say like,

21:01.580 --> 21:05.580
I'm just some old bald asshole.

21:05.580 --> 21:07.580
We can't get over our feeling

21:07.580 --> 21:09.580
that if you heap enough pressure

21:09.580 --> 21:11.580
on that spot, we keep hitting the button

21:11.580 --> 21:13.580
that is linked to shame

21:13.580 --> 21:15.580
and there's a cord dangling.

21:15.580 --> 21:17.580
It's just dangling. It's got tape around it

21:17.580 --> 21:19.580
like that says, fuck you.

21:19.580 --> 21:21.580
And we're just like, we just think,

21:21.580 --> 21:23.580
put cinder blocks on the shame button.

21:23.580 --> 21:25.580
Like maybe he doesn't know how orange he is.

21:25.580 --> 21:27.580
This isn't unconstitutional

21:27.580 --> 21:29.580
last time I checked with him.

21:29.580 --> 21:31.580
What the uplifting thing for me on this one,

21:31.580 --> 21:33.580
I haven't followed it that closely,

21:33.580 --> 21:35.580
but it seemed like this was a thing

21:35.580 --> 21:37.580
that only women did.

21:37.580 --> 21:39.580
Like women just kept coming at him

21:39.580 --> 21:41.580
and they finally fucking took him out.

21:41.580 --> 21:43.580
Which is what you can't do to most people.

21:43.580 --> 21:45.580
Like women actually got together

21:45.580 --> 21:47.580
and took this dude down.

21:47.580 --> 21:49.580
Well, because you saw him in the room

21:49.580 --> 21:51.580
with the German Chancellor, Prime Minister,

21:51.580 --> 21:53.580
President, what is she?

21:53.580 --> 21:55.580
Helgevan Leader?

21:55.580 --> 21:57.580
I thought she was in it.

21:57.580 --> 21:59.580
He wouldn't look her in the eye.

21:59.580 --> 22:01.580
Angela Merkel.

22:01.580 --> 22:03.580
I recognize that.

22:03.580 --> 22:05.580
Angela Merkel.

22:05.580 --> 22:07.580
She's kind of a dog, you know.

22:07.580 --> 22:09.580
Like I think it really got to him

22:09.580 --> 22:11.580
the idea of the tax march.

22:11.580 --> 22:13.580
No, she's impressed. She's a little flat,

22:13.580 --> 22:15.580
but she's okay.

22:15.580 --> 22:17.580
It's hard to be a four

22:17.580 --> 22:19.580
as a Prime Minister.

22:19.580 --> 22:21.580
Oh!

22:21.580 --> 22:23.580
I always think the thing to do is to

22:23.580 --> 22:25.580
I always want to come out

22:25.580 --> 22:27.580
because you know they're also

22:27.580 --> 22:29.580
so homophobic and everything

22:29.580 --> 22:31.580
to come out and just like,

22:31.580 --> 22:33.580
for me to just come out and say,

22:33.580 --> 22:35.580
you know, he sexually, well, like in the case of O'Reilly,

22:35.580 --> 22:37.580
he sexually harassed me.

22:37.580 --> 22:39.580
He was always talking about my ass

22:39.580 --> 22:41.580
and just see if you can get O'Reilly to say,

22:41.580 --> 22:43.580
no, that I definitely didn't do.

22:43.580 --> 22:45.580
No, I definitely did not.

22:45.580 --> 22:47.580
We're going to find out that Mike Pence

22:47.580 --> 22:49.580
is a raging queen, right?

22:49.580 --> 22:51.580
He's been just fucking sucking dick

22:51.580 --> 22:53.580
with both hands his entire life.

22:53.580 --> 22:55.580
From both ends!

22:55.580 --> 22:57.580
From both ends? Hands!

22:57.580 --> 22:59.580
Both, oh, both hands!

22:59.580 --> 23:01.580
Both hands and both ends!

23:01.580 --> 23:03.580
He's such a dick from both ends.

23:03.580 --> 23:05.580
He fucking tops the bottom.

23:07.580 --> 23:09.580
Mike Pence, our vice president

23:09.580 --> 23:11.580
will suck your dick from fucking

23:11.580 --> 23:13.580
top to bottom.

23:13.580 --> 23:15.580
And that's the Mike Pence guarantee.

23:15.580 --> 23:17.580
From the soup that is

23:17.580 --> 23:19.580
your nuts to the

23:19.580 --> 23:21.580
nuts that is the tip of your dick.

23:21.580 --> 23:23.580
Metaphorically,

23:23.580 --> 23:25.580
he will suck your whole dick.

23:25.580 --> 23:27.580
Need someone

23:27.580 --> 23:29.580
to help your balls and penis make sense?

23:31.580 --> 23:33.580
Call the expert at Mike Pence!

23:35.580 --> 23:37.580
But with the Bill O'Reilly thing,

23:37.580 --> 23:39.580
you know, okay, it's better that

23:39.580 --> 23:41.580
he not have a job than get

23:41.580 --> 23:43.580
promoted, but at the same time,

23:43.580 --> 23:45.580
there's like this bleakness in this post-Trump

23:45.580 --> 23:47.580
landscape where we all know

23:47.580 --> 23:49.580
about the polarization now, so we all know

23:49.580 --> 23:51.580
that Trump got elected,

23:51.580 --> 23:53.580
albeit by a minority,

23:53.580 --> 23:55.580
but he got elected

23:55.580 --> 23:57.580
even though, I mean, we heard

23:57.580 --> 23:59.580
him say the worst things a president

23:59.580 --> 24:01.580
theoretically could ever say, and so we now

24:01.580 --> 24:03.580
know it's like there's this force field

24:03.580 --> 24:05.580
type thing that pushes, like, classes

24:05.580 --> 24:07.580
stronger than, for instance, gender

24:07.580 --> 24:09.580
loyalty. Like, if you're

24:09.580 --> 24:11.580
a woman that feels like you're

24:11.580 --> 24:13.580
part of a disenfranchised

24:13.580 --> 24:15.580
demo, it's like,

24:15.580 --> 24:17.580
you don't feel united by

24:17.580 --> 24:19.580
your ovaries to some rich bitch

24:19.580 --> 24:21.580
in Manhattan. You feel actually quite

24:21.580 --> 24:23.580
the opposite. That's what the tables are showing.

24:23.580 --> 24:25.580
And I think

24:25.580 --> 24:27.580
men always thought, oh, yeah,

24:27.580 --> 24:29.580
but, and I think Democratic

24:29.580 --> 24:31.580
men always especially thought, yeah,

24:31.580 --> 24:33.580
but the ladies, the ladies

24:33.580 --> 24:35.580
of, I mean, if you say something bad about the ladies,

24:35.580 --> 24:37.580
they'll have no choice but to stick together.

24:37.580 --> 24:39.580
I think, yeah, I think we all assume

24:39.580 --> 24:41.580
that that would be the special interest

24:41.580 --> 24:43.580
and it wasn't. It was much more like

24:43.580 --> 24:45.580
a woman, I'm

24:45.580 --> 24:47.580
white. It ended up being

24:47.580 --> 24:49.580
the exited defy man. Oh my god, I never

24:49.580 --> 24:51.580
noticed how white I am before

24:51.580 --> 24:53.580
they started talking about what a woman I was.

24:53.580 --> 24:55.580
Boy, I'm so alabaster, I love it.

24:57.580 --> 24:59.580
But watching Bill O'Reilly get fired,

24:59.580 --> 25:01.580
I just know

25:01.580 --> 25:03.580
there's not a single person on the fucking

25:03.580 --> 25:05.580
planet that's been flipped by this,

25:05.580 --> 25:07.580
you know? It's

25:07.580 --> 25:09.580
just as if he might as well have been

25:09.580 --> 25:11.580
fired for saying Merry Christmas

25:11.580 --> 25:13.580
instead of Happy Holidays. Yeah, well, I think most

25:13.580 --> 25:15.580
people aren't flipped. I mean, I think

25:15.580 --> 25:17.580
there's all sorts of proof that

25:17.580 --> 25:19.580
you can show, you can

25:19.580 --> 25:21.580
give people reasonable evidence and there's

25:21.580 --> 25:23.580
all these studies that show, no, they just believe

25:23.580 --> 25:25.580
what they believe is stronger.

25:25.580 --> 25:27.580
Which, as a chimpanzee,

25:27.580 --> 25:29.580
like, that's kind of admirable.

25:29.580 --> 25:31.580
Like, that we have this skepticism,

25:31.580 --> 25:33.580
but it's like, it's a gauge that it's like

25:33.580 --> 25:35.580
if you could just put it on pause

25:35.580 --> 25:37.580
and shit that matters. We have to be willing to,

25:37.580 --> 25:39.580
you know, I don't know, I don't know that I would

25:39.580 --> 25:41.580
pass this test. You have to be willing

25:41.580 --> 25:43.580
to be able to be convinced of another.

25:43.580 --> 25:45.580
Like, if somebody said to me, could

25:45.580 --> 25:47.580
I convince you that

25:47.580 --> 25:49.580
one race or one sex

25:49.580 --> 25:51.580
is better than another, I might

25:51.580 --> 25:53.580
say no. I mean, I might have that

25:53.580 --> 25:55.580
liberal knee jerk, and

25:55.580 --> 25:57.580
somebody who believes, you know, that the

25:57.580 --> 25:59.580
earth is 5,000 years old may also

25:59.580 --> 26:01.580
say no. Right. You know, they may say

26:01.580 --> 26:03.580
no, I can't be convinced. Well, how many times

26:03.580 --> 26:05.580
we all know we have that built-in hero gene

26:05.580 --> 26:07.580
that's like, oh, you're supposed

26:07.580 --> 26:09.580
to be adamant. You're supposed to stick

26:09.580 --> 26:11.580
to your convictions. Yeah, you're supposed

26:11.580 --> 26:13.580
to cross thresholds and explore, but often those things

26:13.580 --> 26:15.580
are foisted upon you, and you're supposed to,

26:15.580 --> 26:17.580
but what you're really supposed to do is defend

26:17.580 --> 26:19.580
the honor of your integrity and all this

26:19.580 --> 26:21.580
shit, and you're, it really is

26:21.580 --> 26:23.580
just an emotional reaction. If somebody says

26:23.580 --> 26:25.580
everything you believe is a lie,

26:25.580 --> 26:27.580
you're kind of, it's not, we don't

26:27.580 --> 26:29.580
call it an admirable characteristic. You go like,

26:29.580 --> 26:31.580
okay, don't boss. Like, we

26:31.580 --> 26:33.580
look at with admiration

26:33.580 --> 26:35.580
upon the hero that goes like,

26:35.580 --> 26:37.580
well, I'm a Sunni.

26:37.580 --> 26:39.580
I'm not a Shia.

26:39.580 --> 26:41.580
And I will never be a Shia.

26:41.580 --> 26:43.580
It's like, you know, I mean,

26:43.580 --> 26:45.580
it really is. It's like,

26:45.580 --> 26:47.580
we all have these tribal things that even

26:47.580 --> 26:49.580
having children, I

26:49.580 --> 26:51.580
have found myself saying things about

26:51.580 --> 26:53.580
like, oh, come on,

26:53.580 --> 26:55.580
you know, buck up. I didn't

26:55.580 --> 26:57.580
mean to, don't tell your mother. I didn't

26:57.580 --> 26:59.580
mean to break your lip or whatever the

26:59.580 --> 27:01.580
specific doesn't matter, but

27:01.580 --> 27:03.580
that seems very

27:03.580 --> 27:05.580
specific.

27:05.580 --> 27:07.580
But, no, but

27:07.580 --> 27:09.580
I mean, I've even found that I've wanted to say

27:09.580 --> 27:11.580
things like, well, you're a herwitzer. Just give them

27:11.580 --> 27:13.580
this little sense of identity that they have.

27:13.580 --> 27:15.580
And then as I do that, I think, well, that's what's wrong

27:15.580 --> 27:17.580
with the whole world.

27:17.580 --> 27:19.580
But you can't really tell a child that you're no

27:19.580 --> 27:21.580
better than it. You should cry

27:21.580 --> 27:23.580
because you're

27:23.580 --> 27:25.580
not special. I mean, how many times a

27:25.580 --> 27:27.580
day or a week at least,

27:27.580 --> 27:29.580
you're in a conversation with somebody that's

27:29.580 --> 27:31.580
collaborating creatively and then somebody starts

27:31.580 --> 27:33.580
to go, you know, here's the thing

27:33.580 --> 27:35.580
though, like if, you know, people love

27:35.580 --> 27:37.580
dogs and you're just like, you're

27:37.580 --> 27:39.580
a better showrunner, for instance, if you

27:39.580 --> 27:41.580
go like, I know where you're going with that, please shut the

27:41.580 --> 27:43.580
fuck up. My writers can handle it. I'm not adding

27:43.580 --> 27:45.580
a dog to the show because you watched

27:45.580 --> 27:47.580
Frasier.

27:47.580 --> 27:49.580
Is that what they did on that show? No.

27:49.580 --> 27:51.580
I'm behind. I haven't. I'm just saying like

27:51.580 --> 27:53.580
Spoiler. There's a dog.

27:53.580 --> 27:55.580
You don't call that

27:55.580 --> 27:57.580
bigotry against someone else's ideas,

27:57.580 --> 27:59.580
but you're using the same

27:59.580 --> 28:01.580
reflexive, kind of almost ignorant,

28:01.580 --> 28:03.580
kind of like barbaric part of your brain

28:03.580 --> 28:05.580
that defends your turds

28:05.580 --> 28:07.580
and piss and eggs, all of which

28:07.580 --> 28:09.580
are equal about you're like, that's where I poop, shit.

28:09.580 --> 28:11.580
Gotta defend that. Gotta defend that.

28:11.580 --> 28:13.580
People are always coming after it. Things that

28:13.580 --> 28:15.580
you secrete, you're like

28:15.580 --> 28:17.580
you're like sensitive about. You're like

28:17.580 --> 28:19.580
I'm pooping and if somebody's

28:19.580 --> 28:21.580
like, knock, knock, you're like, fuck off

28:21.580 --> 28:23.580
and that's what you're supposed to do. That's my poop and piss.

28:23.580 --> 28:25.580
You're not supposed to say, get in here, put

28:25.580 --> 28:27.580
your finger in there and help that turd come out

28:27.580 --> 28:29.580
or put new turds up there.

28:29.580 --> 28:31.580
Mine are just as good as yours.

28:31.580 --> 28:33.580
Keep away from my turds.

28:33.580 --> 28:35.580
I really want to

28:35.580 --> 28:37.580
I want to agree with that.

28:37.580 --> 28:39.580
I'm just

28:39.580 --> 28:41.580
But you're going to

28:41.580 --> 28:43.580
kind of work on my way back to where it started

28:43.580 --> 28:45.580
and I don't know what side I'm on there.

28:45.580 --> 28:47.580
You can have my turds.

28:47.580 --> 28:49.580
I think I'm okay with it. Don't foist your

28:49.580 --> 28:51.580
turds on me.

28:51.580 --> 28:53.580
You know what's possible? You know what I

28:53.580 --> 28:55.580
brought up in a writer's room recently

28:55.580 --> 28:57.580
and was instantly shot down

28:57.580 --> 28:59.580
so I think I'm on to something.

28:59.580 --> 29:01.580
You know

29:01.580 --> 29:03.580
6 billion is a high number.

29:03.580 --> 29:05.580
I remember

29:05.580 --> 29:07.580
for a baker per year, yes.

29:07.580 --> 29:09.580
So last show everybody, things are coming.

29:09.580 --> 29:11.580
How much does a baker make?

29:11.580 --> 29:13.580
That was always our test

29:13.580 --> 29:15.580
of the rich people in the room. How much do you think

29:15.580 --> 29:17.580
a baker makes? 200,000 a year? 500?

29:17.580 --> 29:19.580
What's your guess?

29:19.580 --> 29:21.580
What does a toaster cost?

29:21.580 --> 29:23.580
$500? What do you think?

29:23.580 --> 29:25.580
$450?

29:25.580 --> 29:27.580
You know

29:27.580 --> 29:29.580
having grown up watching things like

29:29.580 --> 29:31.580
all the president's men and you see like

29:31.580 --> 29:33.580
you know, we know it's Nixon

29:33.580 --> 29:35.580
but you're watching these guys sort of

29:35.580 --> 29:37.580
suss it out and you know

29:37.580 --> 29:39.580
Haldeman knew? Higher.

29:39.580 --> 29:41.580
Higher than Haldeman?

29:41.580 --> 29:43.580
Erlichman?

29:43.580 --> 29:45.580
You know, you're watching guy like

29:45.580 --> 29:47.580
it's Nixon, you know, like

29:47.580 --> 29:49.580
you know that experience?

29:49.580 --> 29:51.580
That feeling.

29:51.580 --> 29:53.580
This is almost like

29:53.580 --> 29:55.580
like people who think that the

29:55.580 --> 29:57.580
trade towers, the world trade towers

29:57.580 --> 29:59.580
were an inside job.

29:59.580 --> 30:01.580
World trade towers.

30:01.580 --> 30:03.580
And I wasn't even in that town at that time.

30:03.580 --> 30:05.580
Because the whole point was not to forget.

30:05.580 --> 30:07.580
What did you do?

30:07.580 --> 30:09.580
You immediately forgot.

30:09.580 --> 30:11.580
You had two jobs.

30:11.580 --> 30:13.580
I remember because it's 9-11.

30:13.580 --> 30:15.580
He's so used to on Netflix not being able to

30:15.580 --> 30:17.580
clear the rights to things.

30:17.580 --> 30:19.580
He has to

30:19.580 --> 30:21.580
yes, the multi-corporate

30:21.580 --> 30:23.580
building structures that are

30:23.580 --> 30:25.580
but anyway, I think

30:25.580 --> 30:27.580
people are going to look back at us.

30:27.580 --> 30:29.580
They're going to look back at us

30:29.580 --> 30:31.580
and they're going to say

30:31.580 --> 30:33.580
when everybody, whenever they brought up

30:33.580 --> 30:35.580
you know, Russia interfered with the

30:35.580 --> 30:37.580
elections and all the people on the right

30:37.580 --> 30:39.580
would say they didn't touch the voting machines

30:39.580 --> 30:41.580
and everybody on the left would say

30:41.580 --> 30:43.580
yeah, no, we're not talking about the voting machines.

30:43.580 --> 30:45.580
No, we're saying but they influence, absolutely not.

30:45.580 --> 30:47.580
Those are state things.

30:47.580 --> 30:49.580
I bet you they fucked with the voting machines.

30:49.580 --> 30:51.580
I bet you people are going to see

30:51.580 --> 30:53.580
these news stories

30:53.580 --> 30:55.580
in 50 years and say

30:55.580 --> 30:57.580
how come they didn't know?

30:57.580 --> 30:59.580
How come they wouldn't know that?

30:59.580 --> 31:01.580
What do we know about these folks?

31:01.580 --> 31:03.580
Do we have enough

31:03.580 --> 31:05.580
data to run a reliable

31:05.580 --> 31:07.580
simulator of their

31:07.580 --> 31:09.580
thinking the day they find out

31:09.580 --> 31:11.580
we're voting by computer from now on?

31:11.580 --> 31:13.580
And what would it look like?

31:13.580 --> 31:15.580
Would it look like slot machines?

31:15.580 --> 31:17.580
What would it look like?

31:17.580 --> 31:19.580
Would it look like 95% chance

31:19.580 --> 31:21.580
that Hillary is going to win?

31:21.580 --> 31:23.580
He wins.

31:23.580 --> 31:25.580
Everybody's shocked.

31:25.580 --> 31:27.580
I can't believe everybody voted for Trump.

31:27.580 --> 31:29.580
Everybody's shocked.

31:29.580 --> 31:31.580
Anyway, I think it's a little

31:31.580 --> 31:33.580
paranoid and it's a little conspiracy theory.

31:33.580 --> 31:35.580
I'm with you too.

31:35.580 --> 31:37.580
Why can't we even think about that?

31:37.580 --> 31:39.580
People would be a lot more on board with that idea

31:39.580 --> 31:41.580
than they have been.

31:41.580 --> 31:43.580
I don't know.

31:43.580 --> 31:45.580
I've seen a lot of people do stuff

31:45.580 --> 31:47.580
weird style with computers.

31:47.580 --> 31:49.580
There was this guy who died

31:49.580 --> 31:51.580
in a car

31:51.580 --> 31:53.580
and then they thought that they

31:53.580 --> 31:55.580
cyber-terrorismed him.

31:55.580 --> 31:57.580
And then

31:57.580 --> 31:59.580
they turned out that

31:59.580 --> 32:01.580
they didn't cyber-terrorism him

32:01.580 --> 32:03.580
but they said if this

32:03.580 --> 32:05.580
cyber-terrorism ever happened to someone

32:05.580 --> 32:07.580
it would look exactly like this

32:07.580 --> 32:09.580
and everyone's all like I guess it wasn't

32:09.580 --> 32:11.580
this and that's what it is now.

32:11.580 --> 32:13.580
I wouldn't have suggested it if I knew it was a night writer

32:13.580 --> 32:15.580
but I think

32:15.580 --> 32:17.580
I actually like it better as a night writer.

32:17.580 --> 32:19.580
Anyways.

32:19.580 --> 32:21.580
Anyways.

32:21.580 --> 32:23.580
How are we coping

32:23.580 --> 32:25.580
with our post-100-day

32:25.580 --> 32:27.580
100 days doesn't matter.

32:27.580 --> 32:29.580
It's exhaustion.

32:29.580 --> 32:31.580
No, but I just mean ideologically.

32:31.580 --> 32:33.580
Ridiculous.

32:33.580 --> 32:35.580
Don't you feel the normalization setting in

32:35.580 --> 32:37.580
the exhaustion where you're just like

32:37.580 --> 32:39.580
I don't

32:39.580 --> 32:41.580
I can't keep

32:41.580 --> 32:43.580
being broken hearted anymore.

32:43.580 --> 32:45.580
The healthy part of me wants to move on.

32:45.580 --> 32:47.580
Moving on is called

32:47.580 --> 32:49.580
normalizing.

32:49.580 --> 32:51.580
Stopping the fight but then that's pretentious

32:51.580 --> 32:53.580
because then you go I wasn't fighting.

32:53.580 --> 32:55.580
What if I have a hanky on my face?

32:55.580 --> 32:57.580
I wasn't doing anything badass.

32:57.580 --> 32:59.580
But I'm not talking about

32:59.580 --> 33:01.580
whether or not anything gets results or solved.

33:01.580 --> 33:03.580
Hanky on your face.

33:03.580 --> 33:05.580
Well that's what the modern warriors do.

33:05.580 --> 33:07.580
Right.

33:07.580 --> 33:09.580
But just like as an individual

33:09.580 --> 33:11.580
where you think like

33:11.580 --> 33:13.580
I've gone through this phase, through the phases of

33:13.580 --> 33:15.580
okay that sucks

33:15.580 --> 33:17.580
but good.

33:17.580 --> 33:19.580
I guess I was kind of spoiled. I guess sucky things don't

33:19.580 --> 33:21.580
happen and then it's all me, me, me

33:21.580 --> 33:23.580
and then you go there. It's not about me and I'm gonna

33:23.580 --> 33:25.580
I gotta do more stuff and

33:25.580 --> 33:27.580
I'm gonna buy a gun and just in case

33:27.580 --> 33:29.580
and I'll just

33:29.580 --> 33:31.580
all this energy, energy, energy

33:31.580 --> 33:33.580
and I've truly like the reason I'm confessing

33:33.580 --> 33:35.580
it is because I want, I feel like

33:35.580 --> 33:37.580
confession is better than keeping it a secret.

33:37.580 --> 33:39.580
It's like I'm fucking exhausted.

33:39.580 --> 33:41.580
Oh it's exhausting and you kind of hope, I mean I find myself

33:41.580 --> 33:43.580
hoping boy I hope somebody's really

33:43.580 --> 33:45.580
keeping track of all this.

33:45.580 --> 33:47.580
Like you're trying to memorize all the stuff

33:47.580 --> 33:49.580
to be outraged about.

33:49.580 --> 33:51.580
Like we've already forgotten about

33:51.580 --> 33:53.580
when he was acting like his own PR guy.

33:53.580 --> 33:55.580
Yeah.

33:55.580 --> 33:57.580
Like oh and that!

33:57.580 --> 33:59.580
And it is

33:59.580 --> 34:01.580
you do kind of

34:01.580 --> 34:03.580
you tip your hat to people who are

34:03.580 --> 34:05.580
staying on it

34:05.580 --> 34:07.580
and you know somebody like Elizabeth

34:07.580 --> 34:09.580
Warren I've just seen in a lot of interviews

34:09.580 --> 34:11.580
she's just like unrattled by it. I mean in a way

34:11.580 --> 34:13.580
you almost have to normalize it so that you can

34:13.580 --> 34:15.580
deal with it. But there are people in this

34:15.580 --> 34:17.580
country who because

34:17.580 --> 34:19.580
they grew up with or work with

34:19.580 --> 34:21.580
sociopaths in some degree

34:21.580 --> 34:23.580
that they and they alone

34:23.580 --> 34:25.580
are like very

34:25.580 --> 34:27.580
either more frustrated or less frustrated

34:27.580 --> 34:29.580
but in any case they're in a different plane of dealing

34:29.580 --> 34:31.580
with this because I think what's happening is we're finding

34:31.580 --> 34:33.580
out as most hospital

34:33.580 --> 34:35.580
staff housing sociopath

34:35.580 --> 34:37.580
which is virtually incurable because

34:37.580 --> 34:39.580
they don't want to be cured and

34:39.580 --> 34:41.580
here's the key. We

34:41.580 --> 34:43.580
think based on our

34:43.580 --> 34:45.580
reaction to shame

34:45.580 --> 34:47.580
which is usually hardwired into us

34:47.580 --> 34:49.580
because when your parents see at the top of a

34:49.580 --> 34:51.580
stair and your big ass head

34:51.580 --> 34:53.580
is going to take you down the stairs and they go

34:53.580 --> 34:55.580
uh, Hurwitz no!

34:55.580 --> 34:57.580
Because your parents probably called you Hurwitz.

34:57.580 --> 34:59.580
They put this

34:59.580 --> 35:01.580
I mean maybe that's even where some of the shame

35:01.580 --> 35:03.580
comes from. My therapist calls it healthy shame

35:03.580 --> 35:05.580
it's like cholesterol there's healthy shame

35:05.580 --> 35:07.580
there's toxic shame. You felt

35:07.580 --> 35:09.580
that there's nothing more you can do. Healthy shame

35:09.580 --> 35:11.580
is like oh shit

35:11.580 --> 35:13.580
I gotta be careful. My mom just got really upset.

35:13.580 --> 35:15.580
My mom just got really upset. So

35:15.580 --> 35:17.580
we, because we're built, we're hardwired

35:17.580 --> 35:19.580
with that stuff, we believe

35:19.580 --> 35:21.580
justifiably that

35:21.580 --> 35:23.580
honesty has

35:23.580 --> 35:25.580
this hugely important thing

35:25.580 --> 35:27.580
like you draw a line down the middle of the road

35:27.580 --> 35:29.580
and people are going to tend not to cross it

35:29.580 --> 35:31.580
we think it's because it's like keeping

35:31.580 --> 35:33.580
honest people honest that thing. Well there's a law

35:33.580 --> 35:35.580
against this so I'm not going to do it. It's

35:35.580 --> 35:37.580
our fear of shame

35:37.580 --> 35:39.580
and people who are fascinated with serial

35:39.580 --> 35:41.580
killers and werewolves and mafia

35:41.580 --> 35:43.580
movies and things. We have a president now

35:43.580 --> 35:45.580
who is like fascinating everyone.

35:45.580 --> 35:47.580
Shameless. I mean he's just like he's going

35:47.580 --> 35:49.580
like what do you mean? I

35:49.580 --> 35:51.580
didn't eat the cookies and he says you have

35:51.580 --> 35:53.580
cookies in your face and you show a video

35:53.580 --> 35:55.580
there's the video of you eating cookies and he goes

35:55.580 --> 35:57.580
that video is a real video that's like a cookie video

35:57.580 --> 35:59.580
like I was like

35:59.580 --> 36:01.580
you ate the video I was like I thought I was a cookie

36:01.580 --> 36:03.580
then you ate the cookies I didn't eat anything

36:03.580 --> 36:05.580
and it's just like he's not

36:05.580 --> 36:07.580
lying in his head because there is no

36:07.580 --> 36:09.580
end game it's not like

36:09.580 --> 36:11.580
no it's just survival it's just like a naked ego

36:11.580 --> 36:13.580
and all of us are finding out

36:13.580 --> 36:15.580
that we're defenseless against that

36:15.580 --> 36:17.580
but we have realized that shut up animal

36:17.580 --> 36:19.580
that probably means you are

36:19.580 --> 36:21.580
no if you have an urge to yell it out like that

36:21.580 --> 36:23.580
you probably are defenseless

36:23.580 --> 36:25.580
but I do think the rest of us are not

36:25.580 --> 36:27.580
defenseless

36:27.580 --> 36:29.580
Adam Goldberg

36:29.580 --> 36:31.580
Adam Goldberg

36:31.580 --> 36:33.580
you have 11 seconds on stage

36:33.580 --> 36:35.580
I said his name

36:35.580 --> 36:37.580
Adam Goldberg

36:37.580 --> 36:39.580
Adam Goldberg

36:39.580 --> 36:41.580
I just took up 4

36:41.580 --> 36:43.580
of your second

36:43.580 --> 36:45.580
21, square root of 5

36:45.580 --> 36:47.580
we need one more another versus

36:47.580 --> 36:49.580
I just think need a male voice on stage

36:49.580 --> 36:51.580
finally we're getting

36:51.580 --> 36:53.580
just a dude

36:53.580 --> 36:55.580
can we get some masculine representation on the stage

36:55.580 --> 36:57.580
Adam Goldberg nice to meet you

36:57.580 --> 36:59.580
I'm the guy they hate so

36:59.580 --> 37:01.580
you don't hate you we like you as an enemy

37:01.580 --> 37:03.580
alright then I'm the distinguished

37:03.580 --> 37:05.580
here's what I really

37:05.580 --> 37:07.580
I really think it's not about being defenseless

37:07.580 --> 37:09.580
I think we get

37:09.580 --> 37:11.580
you can't help

37:11.580 --> 37:13.580
you can't resist wanting

37:13.580 --> 37:15.580
what happened

37:15.580 --> 37:17.580
I think

37:17.580 --> 37:19.580
they might be reacting to the fact that Adam Goldberg came on stage

37:19.580 --> 37:21.580
and someone succeeded in just dealing

37:21.580 --> 37:23.580
with it

37:23.580 --> 37:25.580
that you just continued

37:25.580 --> 37:27.580
you're just like I've got so much yard work to do

37:27.580 --> 37:29.580
and I'm not going to let this stop me

37:29.580 --> 37:31.580
Adam we have a lot of show tonight

37:31.580 --> 37:33.580
cause it's our last show

37:33.580 --> 37:35.580
let's briefly weigh in on how things are going in Goldberg

37:35.580 --> 37:37.580
town

37:37.580 --> 37:39.580
alright one I'm working with Endimol Shine

37:39.580 --> 37:41.580
to sell a show so that's good

37:41.580 --> 37:43.580
not really

37:43.580 --> 37:45.580
I mean you can feel the

37:45.580 --> 37:47.580
I'm not coming next week

37:47.580 --> 37:49.580
which makes the one thing

37:49.580 --> 37:51.580
the audience and I agree on

37:51.580 --> 37:53.580
Adam Goldberg everybody

37:53.580 --> 37:55.580
Adam Goldberg

37:55.580 --> 37:57.580
Adam Goldberg

37:57.580 --> 37:59.580
that is literally playing off music

37:59.580 --> 38:01.580
I am literally

38:01.580 --> 38:03.580
playing you off

38:03.580 --> 38:05.580
of the stage

38:05.580 --> 38:07.580
and I will

38:07.580 --> 38:09.580
continue to play

38:09.580 --> 38:11.580
the song

38:11.580 --> 38:13.580
until Adam Goldberg

38:13.580 --> 38:15.580
is gone

38:15.580 --> 38:17.580
and that's the end

38:17.580 --> 38:19.580
of Adam Goldberg's

38:19.580 --> 38:21.580
time

38:21.580 --> 38:23.580
he's still on stage

38:23.580 --> 38:25.580
because he doesn't

38:25.580 --> 38:27.580
pick up on social issues

38:27.580 --> 38:29.580
no I don't

38:29.580 --> 38:31.580
I miss him all

38:33.580 --> 38:35.580
and I'd like to thank you for taking part in

38:35.580 --> 38:37.580
even when the song's over

38:37.580 --> 38:39.580
alright Adam

38:39.580 --> 38:41.580
it would be a crime

38:41.580 --> 38:43.580
he belongs up here

38:43.580 --> 38:45.580
for some percentage of the show

38:45.580 --> 38:47.580
let's make it as little as possible

38:47.580 --> 38:49.580
like what do you call it

38:49.580 --> 38:51.580
a fecal implant

38:51.580 --> 38:53.580
I thought that's what you were going to say

38:53.580 --> 38:55.580
I didn't know what you were saying

38:55.580 --> 38:57.580
but in other words it can promote

38:57.580 --> 38:59.580
it can promote health in the body

38:59.580 --> 39:01.580
is it a fecal implant that you go when someone's already in the room

39:01.580 --> 39:03.580
or do you knock before the fecal implant

39:03.580 --> 39:05.580
it's good for you

39:05.580 --> 39:07.580
you know what I mean

39:07.580 --> 39:09.580
alright Adam

39:09.580 --> 39:11.580
the extent that

39:11.580 --> 39:13.580
capitalism was a system

39:13.580 --> 39:15.580
where a lot of people suffered unnecessarily

39:15.580 --> 39:17.580
I feel like we're going to macro

39:17.580 --> 39:19.580
yeah probably

39:19.580 --> 39:21.580
electing the stupidest, most hateable person

39:21.580 --> 39:23.580
to the head of the system

39:23.580 --> 39:25.580
allows people to organize and say

39:25.580 --> 39:27.580
wait all these things that are wrong

39:27.580 --> 39:29.580
are still wrong and the best they can do

39:29.580 --> 39:31.580
is someone who has holes in his brain

39:31.580 --> 39:33.580
the oldest, dumbest, fattest president

39:33.580 --> 39:35.580
that's ever been elected

39:35.580 --> 39:37.580
I don't know if you were so healthy that we were ready for that lesson

39:37.580 --> 39:39.580
I don't think so

39:39.580 --> 39:41.580
there was a fatter president

39:41.580 --> 39:43.580
Iron man needed to have his thing ripped out

39:43.580 --> 39:45.580
ourselves were really small

39:45.580 --> 39:47.580
and he was a supreme court justice

39:47.580 --> 39:49.580
I will say that if you really

39:49.580 --> 39:51.580
if you compare it to Bush

39:51.580 --> 39:53.580
it was much worse with Bush

39:53.580 --> 39:55.580
in other words it will be worse with Trump

39:55.580 --> 39:57.580
but it hasn't been yet

39:57.580 --> 39:59.580
and if you really, like we just didn't know

39:59.580 --> 40:01.580
what was coming with Bush

40:01.580 --> 40:03.580
but if you think of that moment

40:03.580 --> 40:05.580
you will never have a moment as satisfying

40:05.580 --> 40:07.580
someone as a fool as the my pet goat

40:07.580 --> 40:09.580
you will never have that with Trump

40:09.580 --> 40:11.580
it would be such a victory

40:11.580 --> 40:13.580
he was reading I had the Goats

40:13.580 --> 40:15.580
when the trade centers of New York

40:15.580 --> 40:17.580
when the two match

40:17.580 --> 40:19.580
the identical skyscrapers

40:19.580 --> 40:21.580
the matching towers

40:21.580 --> 40:23.580
alright Adam

40:23.580 --> 40:25.580
I'm just saying

40:25.580 --> 40:27.580
give and take

40:27.580 --> 40:29.580
sorry

40:29.580 --> 40:31.580
I've only voted like five times

40:31.580 --> 40:33.580
and it was in a swing state

40:33.580 --> 40:35.580
Rob's about to come up here and do a straight up improv workshop

40:35.580 --> 40:37.580
about give and take

40:37.580 --> 40:39.580
yes

40:39.580 --> 40:41.580
so I told him to run

40:41.580 --> 40:43.580
when I was at his third wedding whatever it happens

40:43.580 --> 40:45.580
but the point is

40:45.580 --> 40:47.580
the DSA of Los Angeles

40:47.580 --> 40:49.580
has doubled in size since the election

40:49.580 --> 40:51.580
so people are fighting

40:51.580 --> 40:53.580
against the system that's just taking

40:53.580 --> 40:55.580
taking taking from ordinary people

40:55.580 --> 40:57.580
and having the worst opposition in the world

40:57.580 --> 40:59.580
a cartoonish failure

40:59.580 --> 41:01.580
that's everything wrong

41:01.580 --> 41:03.580
you have to stop just enjoying

41:03.580 --> 41:05.580
what an idiot he is

41:05.580 --> 41:07.580
because then it becomes tribal

41:07.580 --> 41:09.580
and people that support him just

41:09.580 --> 41:11.580
they get more from you

41:11.580 --> 41:13.580
and to care about them

41:13.580 --> 41:15.580
I think maybe all minus one

41:15.580 --> 41:17.580
of the marches that have happened downtown

41:17.580 --> 41:19.580
and the signs are hilarious because he's easy

41:19.580 --> 41:21.580
to make fun of and he looks stupid

41:21.580 --> 41:23.580
and he says dumb things

41:23.580 --> 41:25.580
and he's very quotable because he says

41:25.580 --> 41:27.580
like bonkers shit all the time

41:27.580 --> 41:29.580
it's fun to ridicule this guy

41:29.580 --> 41:31.580
and it's kind of this weird palliative

41:31.580 --> 41:33.580
like placebo that we take

41:33.580 --> 41:35.580
and go oh he's ugly

41:35.580 --> 41:37.580
and he has any with the hair is crazy

41:37.580 --> 41:39.580
and he's orange

41:39.580 --> 41:41.580
no he also has hired monsters

41:43.580 --> 41:45.580
it's too easy just to make him

41:45.580 --> 41:47.580
the butt of a joke

41:47.580 --> 41:49.580
but I think it's something way more fun

41:49.580 --> 41:51.580
it's the argument for normalizing him

41:51.580 --> 41:53.580
the argument for normalizing him is

41:53.580 --> 41:55.580
to say okay we're going to let go of this thing

41:55.580 --> 41:57.580
because it's not convincing half the country

41:57.580 --> 41:59.580
and we're going to focus instead

41:59.580 --> 42:01.580
on these corrupt policies and these corrupt people

42:01.580 --> 42:03.580
and we're going to do it from the position

42:03.580 --> 42:05.580
of we don't want Americans to suffer

42:05.580 --> 42:07.580
because that's what's going to happen

42:07.580 --> 42:09.580
62 people have more than

42:09.580 --> 42:11.580
I hate to even include you in this group

42:11.580 --> 42:13.580
but 62 people

42:13.580 --> 42:15.580
61 excluding Dan

42:15.580 --> 42:17.580
have more net worth than

42:17.580 --> 42:19.580
the other half of humanity

42:19.580 --> 42:21.580
it's crazy

42:21.580 --> 42:23.580
it's not a contest

42:23.580 --> 42:25.580
so we should kill Dan Harmon

42:25.580 --> 42:27.580
is that what you're saying

42:27.580 --> 42:29.580
big great final episode

42:29.580 --> 42:31.580
if we're going to conclude the season

42:31.580 --> 42:33.580
there's no fair way to do it

42:33.580 --> 42:35.580
but I create jobs

42:35.580 --> 42:37.580
you're a job creator

42:37.580 --> 42:39.580
there's a guy that feeds my fish

42:39.580 --> 42:41.580
yeah now he's

42:41.580 --> 42:43.580
I have a dog sitter

42:43.580 --> 42:45.580
you want me rich

42:45.580 --> 42:47.580
he trickles down

42:47.580 --> 42:49.580
a guy pretenses a dog

42:49.580 --> 42:51.580
because you hate dogs

42:51.580 --> 42:53.580
but you like people

42:53.580 --> 42:55.580
but I just want to say

42:55.580 --> 42:57.580
the thing is

43:05.580 --> 43:07.580
Adam Goldberg

43:07.580 --> 43:09.580
thank you Brandon

43:09.580 --> 43:11.580
wow

43:11.580 --> 43:13.580
let's bring up Dave Kline

43:13.580 --> 43:15.580
get the fuck on stage

43:15.580 --> 43:17.580
final episode

43:17.580 --> 43:19.580
getting some Dave fucking Klein

43:19.580 --> 43:21.580
yep

43:21.580 --> 43:23.580
can we get a collective fuel

43:23.580 --> 43:25.580
where are you going

43:25.580 --> 43:27.580
god damn you smell good

43:27.580 --> 43:29.580
I'm pitching something

43:29.580 --> 43:31.580
y'all can't smell him

43:31.580 --> 43:33.580
but he smells like a million bucks

43:33.580 --> 43:35.580
some of that might be imperative

43:39.580 --> 43:41.580
Dave Kline, one of our favorite harmonians

43:41.580 --> 43:43.580
welcome

43:43.580 --> 43:45.580
let me give a shout out to Dan Harmon

43:45.580 --> 43:47.580
to this beautiful space

43:47.580 --> 43:49.580
to this church of the abyss

43:49.580 --> 43:51.580
that we all come to on a Sunday night

43:51.580 --> 43:53.580
back in the day when I was laying it down

43:53.580 --> 43:55.580
on the east coast with my boys getting grimy

43:55.580 --> 43:57.580
smoking an L

43:57.580 --> 43:59.580
listening to Harmon with some real grime bags

43:59.580 --> 44:01.580
that never heard of a community

44:01.580 --> 44:03.580
I hear the voices you come out to LA

44:03.580 --> 44:05.580
I meet a beautiful woman

44:05.580 --> 44:07.580

I'm living

44:11.580 --> 44:13.580

I'm living

44:17.580 --> 44:19.580
yo I ain't swimming

44:19.580 --> 44:21.580
I'm just swimming in one

45:15.580 --> 45:17.580

45:17.580 --> 45:19.580
Ryan Ridley

45:21.580 --> 45:23.580
Ryan Ridley

45:23.580 --> 45:25.580
to cleanse the palate

45:29.580 --> 45:31.580
hey

45:31.580 --> 45:33.580
hi, you guys doing a podcast here?

45:33.580 --> 45:35.580

45:35.580 --> 45:37.580
hey Mitch

45:37.580 --> 45:39.580
hey

45:39.580 --> 45:41.580
is that how you hear me?

45:41.580 --> 45:43.580
is that what I sound like?

45:43.580 --> 45:45.580
is that what I sound like?

45:45.580 --> 45:47.580
no, no, no, no, ok stop it Dan

45:47.580 --> 45:49.580
stop it, let him talk

45:49.580 --> 45:51.580
well I have mixed feelings because

45:55.580 --> 45:57.580
I'm hurt

45:57.580 --> 45:59.580
by the insult, but I feel like

45:59.580 --> 46:01.580
well it's a laugh of recognition

46:01.580 --> 46:03.580
they know my voice well enough

46:03.580 --> 46:05.580
to know when it's being mocked

46:05.580 --> 46:07.580
exactly, so I'll take it

46:07.580 --> 46:09.580
alright

46:09.580 --> 46:11.580
I love when nerd eat nerd

46:15.580 --> 46:17.580
but you do other voices, can you do like

46:17.580 --> 46:19.580
like a macho

46:19.580 --> 46:21.580
I could do

46:21.580 --> 46:23.580
can I butch it up, is that what you're asking?

46:23.580 --> 46:25.580
yeah, you know when I'm at a date

46:25.580 --> 46:27.580
you know when I'm at a date I start to take it down

46:27.580 --> 46:29.580
a few

46:29.580 --> 46:31.580
that's a volume, it's volume related

46:31.580 --> 46:33.580
how's the dating life going Ryan?

46:33.580 --> 46:35.580
you're my most single

46:37.580 --> 46:39.580
how single?

46:41.580 --> 46:43.580
I just mean you're the guy I know

46:43.580 --> 46:45.580
the most

46:45.580 --> 46:47.580
that does the most tindering

46:47.580 --> 46:49.580
and bindering and bumbling

46:51.580 --> 46:53.580
don't try to act shy when your ass is on tinder already

46:53.580 --> 46:55.580
not the most desperate, just the most

46:55.580 --> 46:57.580
active is what you're saying

46:57.580 --> 46:59.580
yeah, it's alright

47:01.580 --> 47:03.580
Cody introduced me to a term, what's it called?

47:03.580 --> 47:05.580
dinks

47:05.580 --> 47:07.580
introduced me to I8

47:09.580 --> 47:11.580
she didn't coin it, she's heard it from one of her friends

47:11.580 --> 47:13.580
but it's like

47:15.580 --> 47:17.580
she almost killed Spencer

47:19.580 --> 47:21.580
dinks is a dual income

47:21.580 --> 47:23.580
no kids, it's like couples that have opted out

47:23.580 --> 47:25.580
of the whole biological

47:25.580 --> 47:27.580
perpetuation of this

47:27.580 --> 47:29.580
experiment

47:29.580 --> 47:31.580
you go to

47:31.580 --> 47:33.580
a dinner with another couple

47:33.580 --> 47:35.580
they had to get a sitter and you're like

47:35.580 --> 47:37.580
we got the crumb relay and they're like dinks money

47:39.580 --> 47:41.580
it's like being a gay couple

47:41.580 --> 47:43.580
there's nothing but

47:43.580 --> 47:45.580
income

47:45.580 --> 47:47.580
I'm not saying gay people can't

47:47.580 --> 47:49.580
adopt and settle down and go broke themselves

47:49.580 --> 47:51.580
I'm an advocate

47:51.580 --> 47:53.580
of them doing that

47:53.580 --> 47:55.580
so Ryan

47:55.580 --> 47:57.580
are you asking if I hope to become a dink

47:57.580 --> 47:59.580
or if I'm looking for

47:59.580 --> 48:01.580
I just want to know what adventures are going on

48:01.580 --> 48:03.580
you're the guy that I run into

48:03.580 --> 48:05.580
I go what's going on and then you go

48:05.580 --> 48:07.580
I swiped left instead of right and then this

48:07.580 --> 48:09.580
person came and had a hockey mask

48:09.580 --> 48:11.580
you'll like this

48:11.580 --> 48:13.580
here we go

48:13.580 --> 48:15.580
alright

48:15.580 --> 48:17.580
has anyone ever heard of a little dating app

48:17.580 --> 48:19.580
called RIA

48:19.580 --> 48:21.580
I got on it

48:21.580 --> 48:23.580
wait

48:23.580 --> 48:25.580
that's the one for famous people

48:25.580 --> 48:27.580
you have to be

48:27.580 --> 48:29.580
you have to be kind of famous

48:29.580 --> 48:31.580
the fact that only you know even what it is

48:31.580 --> 48:33.580
means it's special

48:33.580 --> 48:35.580
it's working

48:35.580 --> 48:37.580
it's an exclusive

48:37.580 --> 48:39.580
dating app

48:39.580 --> 48:41.580
for attractive

48:41.580 --> 48:43.580
idiots in LA

48:43.580 --> 48:45.580
and the world over

48:45.580 --> 48:47.580
none of this adds up

48:47.580 --> 48:49.580
what you're asking

48:49.580 --> 48:51.580
I'm not asking

48:51.580 --> 48:53.580
you got to tell them what it really is

48:53.580 --> 48:55.580
you got to use the full description of what it is

48:55.580 --> 48:57.580
how would you describe it

48:57.580 --> 48:59.580
it's a dating app that's secret for famous people

48:59.580 --> 49:01.580
and this motherfucker just gave it away

49:03.580 --> 49:05.580
which means you're not going to be honest tomorrow

49:05.580 --> 49:07.580
listen

49:07.580 --> 49:09.580
you can know where the palace is

49:09.580 --> 49:11.580
but you're not going to get over the boat

49:13.580 --> 49:15.580
but that's awesome because that means

49:15.580 --> 49:17.580
that you had enough famous people to rep you

49:17.580 --> 49:19.580
because

49:19.580 --> 49:21.580
you got to get other famous people to rep you

49:21.580 --> 49:23.580
so you can get

49:23.580 --> 49:25.580
yes

49:25.580 --> 49:27.580
shut up

49:27.580 --> 49:29.580
there's only two guys on it

49:29.580 --> 49:31.580
it's Ryan and Seth Green

49:31.580 --> 49:33.580
so who are you dating now

49:33.580 --> 49:35.580
can I explain

49:35.580 --> 49:37.580
counter to Brandon's theory

49:37.580 --> 49:39.580
I applied

49:39.580 --> 49:41.580
I was put on the waiting list for

49:41.580 --> 49:43.580
at least a year

49:43.580 --> 49:45.580
most of my people didn't have to wait

49:45.580 --> 49:47.580
I was

49:47.580 --> 49:49.580
whining and complaining

49:49.580 --> 49:51.580
you couldn't spend a year going out in public

49:51.580 --> 49:53.580
and being interesting to women

49:57.580 --> 49:59.580
come on

49:59.580 --> 50:01.580
obviously I did that too

50:01.580 --> 50:03.580
obviously

50:03.580 --> 50:05.580
make your case

50:05.580 --> 50:07.580
if Max Landis dies

50:07.580 --> 50:09.580
we'll call you

50:09.580 --> 50:11.580
you know Max Landis is on that shit

50:11.580 --> 50:13.580
they don't say anything

50:13.580 --> 50:15.580
so I broke out my greatest tool

50:15.580 --> 50:17.580
yeah which is Max Landis

50:17.580 --> 50:19.580
I googled the customer service number

50:19.580 --> 50:21.580
and I complained that I wasn't on yet

50:21.580 --> 50:23.580
and the next day

50:23.580 --> 50:25.580
I was approved

50:25.580 --> 50:27.580
so famous

50:27.580 --> 50:29.580
wow

50:29.580 --> 50:31.580
talk about famous

50:31.580 --> 50:33.580
your mom bought these

50:33.580 --> 50:35.580
cool points for me

50:35.580 --> 50:37.580
super famous

50:37.580 --> 50:39.580
you're famous for being the best HR troll

50:39.580 --> 50:41.580
of all time

50:41.580 --> 50:43.580
who was the customer service rep

50:43.580 --> 50:45.580
was it like a game show

50:45.580 --> 50:47.580
host or something

50:49.580 --> 50:51.580
are they all famous

50:51.580 --> 50:53.580
season 2 of the real world

50:53.580 --> 50:55.580
they didn't respond

50:55.580 --> 50:57.580
can we go through what that call was like

51:01.580 --> 51:03.580
hi it's Ryan Ridley from Family Guy

51:03.580 --> 51:05.580

this is Ryan

51:09.580 --> 51:11.580
this is Ria

51:11.580 --> 51:13.580
I'm also on Family Guy

51:13.580 --> 51:15.580
and

51:15.580 --> 51:17.580
we're calling

51:17.580 --> 51:19.580
about your trouble ticket

51:19.580 --> 51:21.580
it was empty

51:21.580 --> 51:23.580
but we're calling you back

51:23.580 --> 51:25.580
Rob are you playing me

51:25.580 --> 51:27.580
no no you're playing you dude

51:27.580 --> 51:29.580
this is quality control

51:29.580 --> 51:31.580
your call is being monitored

51:31.580 --> 51:33.580
by me

51:33.580 --> 51:35.580
Max Landis

51:35.580 --> 51:37.580
I'll be listening

51:37.580 --> 51:39.580
I want the opportunity to have sex

51:39.580 --> 51:41.580
with famous women

51:41.580 --> 51:43.580
so fame is an important quality

51:43.580 --> 51:45.580
I get it

51:45.580 --> 51:47.580
it's intoxicating

51:47.580 --> 51:49.580
aren't you worried that you'll be like

51:49.580 --> 51:51.580
forgive my language for a moment

51:51.580 --> 52:01.580
I'm on this call

52:01.580 --> 52:03.580
it's like a money python sketch

52:03.580 --> 52:05.580
excuse me

52:05.580 --> 52:07.580
Ryan Ridley is on the phone

52:07.580 --> 52:09.580
what are your qualifications

52:09.580 --> 52:11.580
you want to be talking to some famous women

52:11.580 --> 52:13.580
you want to be sexing up the famous women

52:13.580 --> 52:15.580
alright well let's hear it

52:15.580 --> 52:17.580
I'd like to do

52:17.580 --> 52:21.580
but I am on this side of the phone

52:21.580 --> 52:23.580
aren't you worried that

52:23.580 --> 52:25.580
partway into your

52:25.580 --> 52:27.580
scoring with a famous lady

52:27.580 --> 52:29.580
I'm assuming that's how it works

52:29.580 --> 52:31.580
you're going down

52:31.580 --> 52:33.580
on a famous woman in bed

52:33.580 --> 52:35.580
you just hear her going through her phone

52:35.580 --> 52:37.580
up above

52:37.580 --> 52:39.580
well let's make sure he's famous enough

52:39.580 --> 52:41.580
I feel Carrie

52:41.580 --> 52:43.580
what does a blue asterisk mean

52:43.580 --> 52:45.580
and you're like

52:45.580 --> 52:47.580
I'll be exposed

52:47.580 --> 52:49.580
I'll be exposed

52:49.580 --> 52:51.580
you'll go on the date

52:51.580 --> 52:53.580
I guess my metaphor is

52:53.580 --> 52:55.580
you'll go on the date and during the conversation

52:55.580 --> 52:57.580
doesn't it circle the area

52:57.580 --> 52:59.580
so how are you famous

52:59.580 --> 53:01.580
but then you'll say

53:01.580 --> 53:03.580
famous people would never say that to each other

53:03.580 --> 53:05.580
they just probably think

53:05.580 --> 53:07.580
oh you're like

53:07.580 --> 53:09.580
did you go on dates with famous people

53:09.580 --> 53:11.580
oh shit I'm with the girl from full house

53:11.580 --> 53:13.580
oh

53:13.580 --> 53:15.580
oh shit he thought too long

53:19.580 --> 53:21.580
I have not

53:21.580 --> 53:23.580
just give initial

53:23.580 --> 53:25.580
I have not been on one date

53:25.580 --> 53:27.580
thank you

53:27.580 --> 53:29.580
thank you

53:29.580 --> 53:31.580
that's terrible

53:31.580 --> 53:33.580
that's awful

53:33.580 --> 53:35.580
do they have angled swipes on Rio

53:35.580 --> 53:37.580
where you're swiping this way

53:37.580 --> 53:39.580
because they're not famous

53:39.580 --> 53:41.580
they're famous

53:41.580 --> 53:43.580
but they're ugly

53:43.580 --> 53:45.580
it's like upper left

53:45.580 --> 53:47.580
up lower right

53:47.580 --> 53:49.580
it's called ria

53:49.580 --> 53:51.580
ria

53:51.580 --> 53:53.580
okay because it's kind of like diarrhea

53:53.580 --> 53:55.580
okay go ahead

53:55.580 --> 53:57.580
r-a-y-a

53:57.580 --> 53:59.580
I dated Eve Plum

53:59.580 --> 54:01.580
when I first came out here

54:01.580 --> 54:03.580
she was the middle child on the Brady Bunch

54:03.580 --> 54:05.580
and I almost pathologically

54:05.580 --> 54:07.580
did not bring up the Brady Bunch

54:07.580 --> 54:09.580
just like everything else I could think of

54:09.580 --> 54:11.580
to talk about

54:11.580 --> 54:13.580
and then at one point

54:13.580 --> 54:15.580
we were at a place called Coyote

54:15.580 --> 54:17.580
which is now, I forget what it's called now

54:17.580 --> 54:19.580
but anyway she

54:19.580 --> 54:21.580
I was talking to her and then she said

54:21.580 --> 54:23.580
I'm gonna use the restroom and as she walked away

54:23.580 --> 54:25.580
I realized I just said Jan

54:25.580 --> 54:27.580
I think I said

54:27.580 --> 54:29.580
do you know where the restroom is Jan

54:29.580 --> 54:31.580
and she said yeah I'm fine

54:31.580 --> 54:33.580
oh Jesus Christ

54:33.580 --> 54:35.580
did you

54:35.580 --> 54:37.580
I never found out for sure

54:37.580 --> 54:39.580
but then I thought it would be funny to just be like

54:39.580 --> 54:41.580
well your dad's an architect let me ask you a question

54:41.580 --> 54:43.580
I was

54:43.580 --> 54:45.580
completely confused

54:45.580 --> 54:47.580
just make it like a syndrome

54:47.580 --> 54:49.580
but it just was

54:49.580 --> 54:51.580
you don't want to go out with that famous person

54:51.580 --> 54:53.580
it's just like a ghost hanging on you

54:53.580 --> 54:55.580
how Eve was her plum

54:57.580 --> 54:59.580
you'd be surprised at how ineffective

54:59.580 --> 55:01.580
a line like that is with someone like Eve Plum

55:01.580 --> 55:03.580
or an audience

55:03.580 --> 55:05.580
and she sees that stuff coming

55:05.580 --> 55:07.580
she swats it down

55:07.580 --> 55:09.580
without having the technology

55:09.580 --> 55:11.580
of Raya, how does one like us

55:11.580 --> 55:13.580
meet a famous woman

55:13.580 --> 55:15.580
how did you do it?

55:15.580 --> 55:17.580
I would just call her for you

55:17.580 --> 55:19.580
he was at my level when he dated Eve Plum

55:19.580 --> 55:21.580
that's what I'm trying to do

55:21.580 --> 55:23.580
I'll call her, she's 60

55:23.580 --> 55:25.580
but I'll call her for you if you want to

55:25.580 --> 55:27.580
how did you meet her?

55:27.580 --> 55:29.580
a friend of mine said

55:29.580 --> 55:31.580
hey I'm friends with Eve Plum

55:31.580 --> 55:33.580
from the Brady Bunch

55:33.580 --> 55:35.580
he said you want to go out with her

55:35.580 --> 55:37.580
and I did

55:37.580 --> 55:39.580
and actually I felt really bad about it

55:39.580 --> 55:41.580
so you have that to look forward to

55:41.580 --> 55:43.580
but I did, I really was like

55:43.580 --> 55:45.580
she was kind of interested I think

55:45.580 --> 55:47.580
and I

55:47.580 --> 55:49.580
just was aware that I'm into this

55:49.580 --> 55:51.580
for all the wrong reasons

55:51.580 --> 55:53.580
so someday I can be on

55:53.580 --> 55:55.580
a prime time television show

55:55.580 --> 55:57.580
talk show with some famous

55:57.580 --> 55:59.580
anyway I thought I'd tell it

55:59.580 --> 56:01.580
but everybody in some way

56:01.580 --> 56:03.580
it's funny out

56:03.580 --> 56:05.580
didn't pan out

56:05.580 --> 56:07.580
it dribbled out

56:07.580 --> 56:09.580
20 years, 30 years later

56:09.580 --> 56:11.580
when you got on

56:11.580 --> 56:13.580
when you were calling up

56:13.580 --> 56:15.580
customer service and going

56:15.580 --> 56:17.580
I demand to be on this

56:17.580 --> 56:19.580
I demand, I demand

56:19.580 --> 56:21.580
stop locking up your women

56:21.580 --> 56:23.580
I know they're in there

56:23.580 --> 56:25.580
I deserve one

56:25.580 --> 56:27.580
what is your dream life

56:27.580 --> 56:29.580
everybody on your site

56:29.580 --> 56:31.580
I'm not going to deny that any of this was in my head

56:31.580 --> 56:33.580
what woman

56:33.580 --> 56:35.580
were you hoping, give me a name

56:35.580 --> 56:37.580
give us like your

56:37.580 --> 56:39.580
Alyssa Milano

56:39.580 --> 56:41.580
oh god it was Alyssa Milano

56:41.580 --> 56:43.580
I wasn't, look at him

56:43.580 --> 56:45.580
oh my god

56:45.580 --> 56:47.580
I didn't have anyone in mind

56:47.580 --> 56:49.580
but as I swipe

56:49.580 --> 56:51.580
through I was like whoa her

56:51.580 --> 56:53.580
from that one thing

56:53.580 --> 56:55.580
who's guys number 4 you get on

56:55.580 --> 56:57.580
it's like I said

56:57.580 --> 56:59.580
would you like to date Alyssa and Hannigan

56:59.580 --> 57:01.580
yes I would

57:01.580 --> 57:03.580
that'll be $5 in proof of fame please

57:05.580 --> 57:07.580
you can preview her

57:07.580 --> 57:09.580
but you can't have a

57:09.580 --> 57:11.580
fulfilling relationship with her

57:11.580 --> 57:13.580
you must have had some kind of scenario

57:13.580 --> 57:15.580
you were picturing Dame Judy Dench

57:15.580 --> 57:17.580
you had something in your mind

57:17.580 --> 57:19.580
you had something in general

57:19.580 --> 57:21.580
in age range

57:21.580 --> 57:23.580
some proportions

57:23.580 --> 57:25.580
maybe something in trauma

57:25.580 --> 57:27.580
not comedy

57:27.580 --> 57:29.580
but also somebody so famous enough

57:29.580 --> 57:31.580
to be on the site

57:31.580 --> 57:33.580
good looking enough for you to be attracted to her

57:33.580 --> 57:35.580
but also on a dating site

57:35.580 --> 57:37.580
for famous people

57:37.580 --> 57:39.580
damaged enough

57:39.580 --> 57:41.580
am I damaged?

57:41.580 --> 57:43.580
maybe she's just been hurt too many times

57:43.580 --> 57:45.580
she wants to try new things

57:45.580 --> 57:47.580
I'm not going to mess around this time

57:47.580 --> 57:49.580
I just want somebody famous

57:49.580 --> 57:51.580
you know

57:51.580 --> 57:53.580
happy hurt again

57:53.580 --> 57:55.580
if I could just get

57:55.580 --> 57:57.580
just an X teen star

57:57.580 --> 57:59.580
maybe a drummer

57:59.580 --> 58:01.580
is going to rehab

58:01.580 --> 58:03.580
I've been too shallow

58:03.580 --> 58:05.580
adult swim writer famous

58:05.580 --> 58:07.580
that's what I want

58:07.580 --> 58:09.580
just that level

58:11.580 --> 58:13.580
he got me right where it hurts

58:13.580 --> 58:15.580
now is it true Ryan

58:15.580 --> 58:17.580
I heard this from somebody

58:17.580 --> 58:19.580
that dating apps

58:19.580 --> 58:21.580
do you have to be

58:21.580 --> 58:23.580
I think I heard this on S town

58:23.580 --> 58:25.580
whatever it's called

58:25.580 --> 58:27.580
yeah

58:27.580 --> 58:29.580
we can call it shit down

58:29.580 --> 58:31.580
whatever we want

58:31.580 --> 58:33.580
it's another podcast that's ripping us off

58:37.580 --> 58:39.580
another podcast where 11 guys get drunk

58:39.580 --> 58:41.580
and jabber for 2 hours

58:43.580 --> 58:45.580
it's not far from that

58:45.580 --> 58:47.580
but anyways

58:47.580 --> 58:49.580
the idea

58:49.580 --> 58:51.580
you can't

58:51.580 --> 58:53.580
for the duration that most people are single

58:55.580 --> 58:57.580
it's sort of like gym membership

58:57.580 --> 58:59.580
in that

58:59.580 --> 59:01.580
if you only sign up

59:01.580 --> 59:03.580
for dating services

59:03.580 --> 59:05.580
whatever you want to call them

59:05.580 --> 59:07.580
for the amount of time

59:07.580 --> 59:09.580
that you're single

59:09.580 --> 59:11.580
and then you immediately pull out of them

59:11.580 --> 59:13.580
as soon as you have a thing happening

59:13.580 --> 59:15.580
that makes you oh I don't need this anymore

59:15.580 --> 59:17.580
and then re

59:17.580 --> 59:19.580
just the time

59:19.580 --> 59:21.580
it makes you permanently

59:21.580 --> 59:23.580
ineffective in those zones

59:23.580 --> 59:25.580
that it's like people are thinking about that

59:25.580 --> 59:27.580
that way now

59:27.580 --> 59:29.580
I don't want to pay the membership fees again

59:29.580 --> 59:31.580
but it's also sort of like rhythmically

59:31.580 --> 59:33.580
you'll circle the drain

59:33.580 --> 59:35.580
forever without going in it

59:35.580 --> 59:37.580
I guess in this metaphor going into a drain is good

59:37.580 --> 59:39.580
it's beautiful

59:39.580 --> 59:41.580
at some point you have to shit

59:41.580 --> 59:43.580
or get off the pot and that's a beautiful sentiment

59:43.580 --> 59:45.580
you're really moving forward

59:45.580 --> 59:47.580
I'm ready to take that shit

59:47.580 --> 59:49.580
the tragic thing

59:49.580 --> 59:51.580
is that you can't

59:51.580 --> 59:53.580
I think kids today are encountering the fact that

59:53.580 --> 59:55.580
they can't shut down

59:55.580 --> 59:57.580
all of their electronic

59:57.580 --> 59:59.580
tendrils just because

59:59.580 --> 01:00:01.580
they got into a meaningful relationship

01:00:01.580 --> 01:00:03.580
because it's almost like this

01:00:03.580 --> 01:00:05.580
worse thing than even a prenup

01:00:05.580 --> 01:00:07.580
where it's like you have to admit to yourself

01:00:07.580 --> 01:00:09.580
and the world that well

01:00:09.580 --> 01:00:11.580
but I still have this pool

01:00:11.580 --> 01:00:13.580
of like I still have this inbox

01:00:13.580 --> 01:00:15.580
I mean when most people stop dating

01:00:15.580 --> 01:00:17.580
they get serious in a relationship

01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:19.580
they're really giving up two other opportunities

01:00:19.580 --> 01:00:21.580
you know what I mean?

01:00:21.580 --> 01:00:23.580
there's that other woman at work

01:00:23.580 --> 01:00:25.580
but she's married

01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:27.580
oh and then there's the woman who brings us the lunch

01:00:27.580 --> 01:00:29.580
but you know and it's like

01:00:29.580 --> 01:00:31.580
no this is the one

01:00:31.580 --> 01:00:33.580
here's what I'm saying

01:00:33.580 --> 01:00:35.580
I'm saying that

01:00:35.580 --> 01:00:37.580
we went from

01:00:37.580 --> 01:00:39.580
oh you have to be in a bar

01:00:39.580 --> 01:00:41.580
and run into somebody physically

01:00:41.580 --> 01:00:43.580
like we remember when computer dating started

01:00:43.580 --> 01:00:45.580
and we were all like

01:00:45.580 --> 01:00:47.580
computers play in matchmaker

01:00:47.580 --> 01:00:49.580
now these kids it's almost weirder

01:00:49.580 --> 01:00:51.580
when you like

01:00:51.580 --> 01:00:53.580
when you run into a couple that met

01:00:53.580 --> 01:00:55.580
in a library or a bar or something like that

01:00:55.580 --> 01:00:57.580
it's more common that oh there's the name of an app

01:00:57.580 --> 01:00:59.580
comes out of their mouth

01:00:59.580 --> 01:01:01.580
how did you meet

01:01:01.580 --> 01:01:03.580
but I'm wondering what the

01:01:03.580 --> 01:01:05.580
if it's all good or if it's like the darkness

01:01:05.580 --> 01:01:07.580
part of it is that it's like

01:01:07.580 --> 01:01:09.580
it's a good thing for sex and sexuality

01:01:09.580 --> 01:01:11.580
to be demystified and monogamy to be

01:01:11.580 --> 01:01:13.580
that it's like well hey you know I got a little

01:01:13.580 --> 01:01:15.580
barbershop open it's like

01:01:15.580 --> 01:01:17.580
yes you're my favorite customer

01:01:17.580 --> 01:01:19.580
place is still open I tell everybody

01:01:19.580 --> 01:01:21.580
it's gonna be three hours

01:01:21.580 --> 01:01:23.580
like

01:01:23.580 --> 01:01:25.580
but that three hours could be a year

01:01:25.580 --> 01:01:27.580
you know what I mean it's like

01:01:27.580 --> 01:01:29.580
we're coming from a world where it would be

01:01:29.580 --> 01:01:31.580
offensive for the place to be open

01:01:31.580 --> 01:01:33.580
but we have to now break it into

01:01:33.580 --> 01:01:35.580
these kids have to break things into waiting rooms

01:01:35.580 --> 01:01:37.580
because if they pull out

01:01:37.580 --> 01:01:39.580
of Tinder tomb blur or whatever

01:01:39.580 --> 01:01:41.580
they get back into it

01:01:41.580 --> 01:01:43.580
and they'll find it because

01:01:45.580 --> 01:01:47.580
it's 9-11

01:02:01.580 --> 01:02:03.580
they were celebrating

01:02:03.580 --> 01:02:05.580
yeah this was

01:02:05.580 --> 01:02:07.580
that mosque this was the mosque

01:02:07.580 --> 01:02:09.580
that was celebrating

01:02:09.580 --> 01:02:11.580
I mean Mitch Mitch you must be

01:02:11.580 --> 01:02:13.580
talking about the world trade towers going down

01:02:13.580 --> 01:02:15.580
that's what they're called

01:02:15.580 --> 01:02:17.580
hey Ryan Ryan Ryan

01:02:17.580 --> 01:02:19.580
what's this

01:02:19.580 --> 01:02:21.580
he doesn't know what they're called

01:02:21.580 --> 01:02:23.580
well I knew one of them

01:02:23.580 --> 01:02:25.580
was called but I just couldn't remember the other

01:02:25.580 --> 01:02:27.580
you forgot that there was a central

01:02:27.580 --> 01:02:29.580
centralization of two things

01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:31.580
alright

01:02:31.580 --> 01:02:33.580
do you guys want to just take one look at

01:02:33.580 --> 01:02:35.580
you know what Dustin Marshall is

01:02:35.580 --> 01:02:37.580
he's a producer

01:02:37.580 --> 01:02:39.580
you know I always make fun

01:02:39.580 --> 01:02:41.580
we're dressed like Beetlejuice

01:02:41.580 --> 01:02:43.580
and he's like black

01:02:43.580 --> 01:02:45.580
he's got a little black music cap

01:02:45.580 --> 01:02:47.580
I guess he defeated the ball rock

01:02:47.580 --> 01:02:49.580
or got defeated by one

01:02:49.580 --> 01:02:51.580
so now he's

01:02:51.580 --> 01:02:53.580
he's leveled up I think

01:02:53.580 --> 01:02:55.580
because he used to

01:02:55.580 --> 01:02:57.580
notoriously the only thing white he ever

01:02:57.580 --> 01:02:59.580
wore was the headphones that he would always have

01:02:59.580 --> 01:03:01.580
but now he's dressed like a hotel

01:03:01.580 --> 01:03:03.580
room couch

01:03:03.580 --> 01:03:05.580
is he back there now

01:03:05.580 --> 01:03:07.580
Dustin Marshall

01:03:07.580 --> 01:03:09.580
show yourself

01:03:09.580 --> 01:03:11.580
Dustin Marshall is not back there

01:03:11.580 --> 01:03:13.580
oh here he comes

01:03:17.580 --> 01:03:19.580
yes

01:03:19.580 --> 01:03:21.580
no no you don't have to

01:03:21.580 --> 01:03:23.580
we just want to look at him that's all

01:03:23.580 --> 01:03:25.580
he can promote some

01:03:25.580 --> 01:03:27.580
feral audio things

01:03:27.580 --> 01:03:29.580
yes

01:03:29.580 --> 01:03:31.580
so it's our last show at meltdown

01:03:31.580 --> 01:03:33.580
it's like half a decade

01:03:33.580 --> 01:03:35.580

01:03:35.580 --> 01:03:37.580
some really good molly

01:03:37.580 --> 01:03:39.580

we have a show

01:03:43.580 --> 01:03:45.580
kind of live in the dream because we are always

01:03:45.580 --> 01:03:47.580
talking about starting our own space

01:03:47.580 --> 01:03:49.580
and we started a live streaming company

01:03:49.580 --> 01:03:51.580
with our friends Kevin Day and Kris Boruffff

01:03:53.580 --> 01:03:55.580
they made this state of the art

01:03:55.580 --> 01:03:57.580
live streaming service for us

01:03:57.580 --> 01:03:59.580
we own everything

01:03:59.580 --> 01:04:01.580
but we have a show next Friday

01:04:01.580 --> 01:04:03.580
there's two shows next Friday at our new venue

01:04:03.580 --> 01:04:05.580
Duncan Trussell is doing a stand up show

01:04:05.580 --> 01:04:07.580
Thursday

01:04:07.580 --> 01:04:09.580
and then feral audio

01:04:09.580 --> 01:04:11.580
and the be here now network which is like

01:04:11.580 --> 01:04:13.580
Rom Doss's people

we're putting on a special show where it's like

01:04:15.580 --> 01:04:25.580
we're putting on a special show

01:04:25.580 --> 01:04:27.580
that

01:04:27.580 --> 01:04:29.580
that

01:04:29.580 --> 01:04:31.580
that microphone was my

01:04:31.580 --> 01:04:33.580
that

01:04:33.580 --> 01:04:35.580
Rom Doss ain't no joke

01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:37.580
but

01:04:37.580 --> 01:04:39.580
it's uh

01:04:39.580 --> 01:04:41.580
oh my god

01:04:41.580 --> 01:04:45.580
I don't think this is even on

01:04:45.580 --> 01:04:47.580
I don't think this is even on

01:04:51.580 --> 01:04:53.580
oh shit

01:04:53.580 --> 01:04:55.580
you made the right call leaving this one off

01:04:59.580 --> 01:05:01.580
the jury is still like is Rom Doss a joke or not a joke

01:05:01.580 --> 01:05:03.580
Rom Doss ain't no joke

01:05:03.580 --> 01:05:05.580
no joke

01:05:07.580 --> 01:05:09.580
first rule of improv is you know

01:05:09.580 --> 01:05:11.160
I don't know, be here now.

01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:14.160
So it's gonna be funny, it's gonna be funny.

01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:16.540
He ain't no joke though.

01:05:16.540 --> 01:05:18.600
Duncan Trussell and I, like years ago,

01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:20.360
Duncan Trussell is very like,

01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:21.740
even before I moved here, you know,

01:05:21.740 --> 01:05:22.920
he was very informative in getting me

01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:24.400
into like Alan Watts and Rom Doss

01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:27.060
and we're really trying to like,

01:05:27.060 --> 01:05:29.480
the spiritual community are so cool or like, cool as shit.

01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:31.880
So we're putting on a show at this awesome venue,

01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:33.840
Starburn's Castle.

01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:35.600
It'll be Duncan Trussell,

01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:37.600
Kate Verlant and Chelsea Peretti,

01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:40.080
talking to Sharon Salzburg

01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:41.760
and a bunch of people from the Rom Doss community.

01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:44.200
So definitely get tickets now.

01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:45.960
There's a bunch of surprises lined up too.

01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:50.440
As I'm led to believe, this new show is no joke.

01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:51.720
It is no joke.

01:05:51.720 --> 01:05:54.520
Rom Doss is no fucking joke.

01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:56.000
But yes, thank you, Dan.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
All right, Justin, the white.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:01.000
Justin Marshall!

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.240
Ferrellaudio.com.

01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:04.640
Go to ferrellaudio.com.

01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:07.040
Follow your heart.

01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:12.040
Damn, Dustin's trainers are white.

01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:16.400
Got some white trainers, it's all clean.

01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:17.640
He's not wearing those piss wipers.

01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:18.960
When I was a kid on the playground,

01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:20.440
did they call them piss wipers, Brandon,

01:06:20.440 --> 01:06:23.280
when you were on the grade school playground?

01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:24.120
No.

01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:28.640
It was like when the 80s craze.

01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:29.480
What's a piss wiper?

01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:31.040
You were supposed to wear like,

01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:32.720
your Jordans and stuff.

01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:34.960
So if you had regular Chuck Taylor's,

01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:37.320
particularly like the white canvas ones,

01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:38.280
those were called piss wipers

01:06:38.280 --> 01:06:40.680
because they would turn kind of yellow over time.

01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:42.320
Because you pissed on them?

01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:44.080
Yeah.

01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:44.920
I'd never heard that.

01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:46.440
Don't look at me like you hate me.

01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:53.280
Look at me with...

01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:55.200
Look at him like you want to go over to his place

01:06:55.200 --> 01:06:57.120
and watch Grudge.

01:06:57.120 --> 01:06:59.040
Do you guys know that dating at piss wipers?

01:06:59.040 --> 01:07:00.320
You just like, you just...

01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:02.200
Are you saying like from one pisser?

01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:03.280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:06.240
I'm actually too famous to get on piss wipers.

01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:07.160
Yeah.

01:07:07.160 --> 01:07:08.400
No famies.

01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:09.760
No famies.

01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:11.440
Hey, Ryan.

01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:14.160
What's the sexiest date you've ever been on?

01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:18.120
Music, music, music, music.

01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:20.800
Here we go.

01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:21.640
Walk us through it.

01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:22.480
Walk us through it.

01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:23.560
Oh, I don't want to do this.

01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:24.400
Hang on.

01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:26.040
You don't have to give names.

01:07:26.040 --> 01:07:28.440
I'm not comfortable with my sexuality enough

01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:30.120
to describe this.

01:07:30.120 --> 01:07:31.280
I'm uptight.

01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:32.920
Well, tell, wait, I got one.

01:07:32.920 --> 01:07:33.760
Okay.

01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:34.600
Okay, here we go.

01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:35.840
No, no, no, no, I don't got one.

01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:39.720
I mean, tell us the sexiest date in your mind,

01:07:39.720 --> 01:07:41.120
what you'd let your fantasy date.

01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:41.960
That's what I meant.

01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:43.960
The perfect date for Ryan Ridley

01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:46.000
for those ladies who want to become famous

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:47.400
so that they have access to it.

01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:49.320
Here we go.

01:07:49.320 --> 01:07:50.160
We now take a view.

01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:51.000
This is an incentive.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:51.840
Sometimes the ladies are like,

01:07:51.840 --> 01:07:53.280
why would I even want to be famous?

01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:54.720
I already have too much attention

01:07:54.720 --> 01:07:56.640
from a horrible culture of men.

01:07:56.640 --> 01:07:58.240
Get ready for it.

01:07:58.240 --> 01:08:00.560
Why not just sit here and be nervous

01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:01.880
every time there's a knock at the door?

01:08:01.880 --> 01:08:03.040
I'll tell you why.

01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:04.040
Why you should get out there.

01:08:04.040 --> 01:08:06.720
You might get famous, then you can date this guy.

01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:10.000
That's a little piss wiper.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:13.400
So here's your description of the perfect date.

01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:14.240
Perfect date.

01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:16.040
Can I get a location from the audience?

01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:17.360
That's a date.

01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:20.680
All right.

01:08:23.560 --> 01:08:24.880
The standard.

01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:26.720
I thought the standard was good.

01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:27.880
The standard.

01:08:27.880 --> 01:08:28.720
Wait.

01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:31.800
The standard, but it's upside down.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:35.800
The standard.

01:08:35.800 --> 01:08:37.960
I heard Pasadena.

01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:40.400
Okay, we now take you to a date with Ryan Ridley

01:08:40.400 --> 01:08:42.080
at a hotel where they're so cool

01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:44.120
they write their name upside down.

01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:46.720
It's the standard.

01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:54.760
Can I get a famous woman from the audience?

01:08:54.760 --> 01:08:55.600
Clearly not.

01:08:57.200 --> 01:08:57.960
I thought you were gonna

01:08:57.960 --> 01:08:58.800
Marlo Thomas.

01:08:58.800 --> 01:08:59.960
The girl from the ring.

01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:03.200
Marlo Thomas?

01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:04.680
Did you say Marlo Thomas?

01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:05.680
Yes, I did.

01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:06.840
All right.

01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:09.800
But Ryan, you have to pick for our purposes.

01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:10.640
You have to pick.

01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:11.560
You didn't even pick the place.

01:09:11.560 --> 01:09:12.400
You're gonna pick the-

01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:16.240
I'm not a good improviser.

01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:17.080
Oh my God.

01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:17.920
Damn.

01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:20.320
What the hell am I supposed to say?

01:09:20.320 --> 01:09:21.640
Pick it, man.

01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:22.480
Pick a place.

01:09:22.480 --> 01:09:23.320
I don't want to.

01:09:23.320 --> 01:09:24.160
I don't want to put you on the spot.

01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:25.000
Pick a lady.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:25.840
I don't want to put you on the spot.

01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:27.200
Pick an actress that you've never been out of fantasies about.

01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:28.280
How about one of the women?

01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:31.040
I haven't seen it, but one of the women from Hidden Figures.

01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:31.880
Oh.

01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:33.960
Or is that the right one kind of fame?

01:09:33.960 --> 01:09:34.800
The one in the wheelchair?

01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:35.640
No.

01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:36.480
No, no, okay.

01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:37.320
Let me tell you something.

01:09:37.320 --> 01:09:38.160
Yeah.

01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:39.000
Because of what I know,

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:39.840
they're very, very impressive women.

01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:41.160
Absolutely.

01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:43.240
And they've sort of taken a backseat in many ways.

01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:45.080
You should be so lucky.

01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:45.920
How about this one?

01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:46.760
Yeah, you should be so lucky.

01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:47.600
I haven't seen it,

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:49.240
but it sounds like they're really special.

01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:51.120
Yeah, you should be so lucky.

01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:52.240
How about that woman that hangs out

01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:53.160
with Dog the Bounty Hunter?

01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:54.000
How about her?

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:54.840
First of all.

01:09:55.760 --> 01:09:56.840
Was she a Hidden Figure?

01:09:56.840 --> 01:09:58.520
Was she hidden in something?

01:09:58.520 --> 01:09:59.720
I just want to say,

01:09:59.720 --> 01:10:01.200
you don't have to do improv.

01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:04.080
I wasn't asking you to reenact the team with a famous one.

01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:04.920
I'm saying,

01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:06.200
in your mind,

01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:09.440
like if things were going perfectly,

01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:12.640
what would happen from the moment you start getting dressed?

01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:13.480
Be it?

01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:15.480
And you're putting on your favorite belt?

01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:16.880
I don't have to try for a laugh.

01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:18.680
You're saying you're giving me permission to just be earnest.

01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:20.200
It's gonna be funny if you're earnest.

01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:21.040
No, no.

01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:23.160
Is what I've learned,

01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:24.800
it's not my prediction for you,

01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:27.080
is what I've learned.

01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:29.680
Why am I a joke to you?

01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:32.400
Everyone's a joke to everyone.

01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:35.360
If you're, I'm saying the royal you,

01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:37.560
if you're earnest, it's gonna be funny.

01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:38.800
Yes, you know that.

01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:39.760
You know what I'm talking about.

01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:42.000
All right, so Ryan, Ryan.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:43.720
What would you really, like as a guy,

01:10:43.720 --> 01:10:45.360
now you're in the scene,

01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:47.520
like all I can think about is getting home to Cody.

01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:48.600
It's a very specific thing,

01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:51.720
because now I'm in it and I'm like,

01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:54.760
I'm in the chrysalis, as my therapist calls it.

01:10:54.760 --> 01:10:57.200
I just want to go home and watch fo-fi,

01:10:57.200 --> 01:10:58.760
and it's forensic files.

01:10:58.760 --> 01:10:59.760
We don't have time.

01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:06.960
I just lost my boner for a thousand years, fo-fi.

01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:09.160
But.

01:11:09.160 --> 01:11:11.160
That's how hairbillies refer to the president.

01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:16.320
We don't kick into that, we're fo-fi.

01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:17.160
Woo!

01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:23.760
I want to hear about this magical date.

01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:25.720
I just like to take a lady out

01:11:25.720 --> 01:11:28.960
and have a nice conversation over a drink, man.

01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:31.760
Well, go slower and start at the beginning.

01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:34.480
It's 7.30 p.m. and put it on your belt.

01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:36.920
And Zac McKeever has a sexy beat for us up till now.

01:11:36.920 --> 01:11:39.680
Zach, Zach, put a beat on before you get beat on.

01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:42.080
Huh, who said that?

01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:46.000
Thank you, Adam.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.840
Adam, if anything, I feel closer in status to you

01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:50.440
than I did to anybody else up here.

01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:52.480
Thank you.

01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:53.440
You're now on a date with Adam.

01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:55.160
You're on a date with a sexy lady.

01:11:56.360 --> 01:11:57.520
All right, you're putting on your belt.

01:11:57.520 --> 01:11:58.360
Yeah, putting on my belt.

01:11:58.360 --> 01:12:00.560
I mean, my belt will probably already be on at 7.30 p.m.

01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:02.000
I've been wearing it all day, but.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:03.360
You're doing great, keep it up.

01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:07.000
I would, I probably put on fresh deodorants.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:07.840
Great.

01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:11.600
Wash my face, put on fresh moisturizer.

01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:12.920
Your belt's already on in your-

01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:14.760
At 7.30 p.m. I've been at work all day

01:12:14.760 --> 01:12:17.360
and I came home and I, you know, barely,

01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:20.840
because, you know, you kept us right until about seven.

01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:25.040
So, it's part of your fantasy.

01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:28.200
I could have gotten hit by a train.

01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:32.200
It doesn't, you might, but maybe that's-

01:12:32.200 --> 01:12:34.440
In this fantasy, there's a season four.

01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:36.440
That's the biggest part of this fantasy.

01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:40.520
Coming in 2020.

01:12:40.520 --> 01:12:42.520
I'm going to take a woman on a date again.

01:12:42.520 --> 01:12:45.000
All right, my burner just came back.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.720
I've said to you, I said at 6.00 p.m.

01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:51.720
I said, usually we work longer than this.

01:12:51.720 --> 01:12:54.280
But Ryan did such a good job today.

01:12:54.280 --> 01:12:58.080
Ryan has checked Marlowe Thomas' IMDB page 12 times today.

01:12:58.080 --> 01:12:58.920
He's excited.

01:12:58.920 --> 01:12:59.760
Let's get him out of here.

01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:00.600
Let's all go home.

01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:02.560
There's nothing left to do because of Ryan.

01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:06.160
And then you skip home on a cloud of lightning.

01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:07.600
Okay.

01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:10.080
Yeah, and so I already said I put on fresh deodorant.

01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:12.560
You know, I'll probably change into my nice shirt.

01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:13.400
Robocop.

01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:17.880
Because the ideal date-

01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:19.080
Low-hanging fruit, Rob.

01:13:19.080 --> 01:13:20.280
Low-hanging fruit.

01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:24.240
Hey, hey, I'll go for whatever fruit I can get.

01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:25.600
Are you going to pick her up?

01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:26.600
Or is she coming?

01:13:26.600 --> 01:13:27.480
Are you going to meet her?

01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:29.000
Traditionally, on a first date, you

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:30.360
meet someone at a location.

01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:31.200
What's your fantasy?

01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:34.600
Either equidistant, oh, then in my neighborhood.

01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:35.680
She's coming to you.

01:13:35.680 --> 01:13:38.240
Yeah, even if she doesn't call her city, then yeah.

01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:40.200
Is she coming to your door?

01:13:40.200 --> 01:13:40.760
You want to meet her?

01:13:40.760 --> 01:13:41.880
No, no, no, that's creepy.

01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:43.600
On a first date, that's very creepy, dude.

01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:44.260
Neutral territory.

01:13:44.260 --> 01:13:45.040
Where do you want to meet her?

01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:45.960
You want the woman you'll see?

01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:46.720
Are you wearing?

01:13:46.720 --> 01:13:48.440
Are you wearing meundies right now or not?

01:13:48.440 --> 01:13:49.000
Absolutely.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:49.840
It's all I wear, bro.

01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:50.880
100%.

01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:51.960
Where do you want to meet her?

01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:53.600
Free commercial.

01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:55.720
You know, a nice bar restaurant.

01:13:55.720 --> 01:13:57.440
Are you saying be specific?

01:13:57.440 --> 01:13:58.600
Yeah, be specific.

01:13:58.600 --> 01:13:59.520
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:01.040
What am I getting the Jesus Christ from this guy for?

01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:01.360
I don't know.

01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:02.240
Let's get this guy up here.

01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:03.120
There's no wrong.

01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:04.520
He's Jesus Christing me.

01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:08.160
He's right.

01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:09.480
You don't have to worry about that.

01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:10.240
You're on a fantasy date.

01:14:10.240 --> 01:14:11.200
This is your date.

01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:12.520
This is your date, Ryan.

01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:13.280
Where do you want to meet her?

01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:13.760
This lack of math.

01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:14.360
You could make a place.

01:14:14.360 --> 01:14:14.800
You could make a place.

01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:15.320
A setting.

01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:17.200
You could make a new place up that doesn't exist.

01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:18.680
Everybody talk at the same time.

01:14:18.680 --> 01:14:22.840
Even the audience.

01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:25.520
Studio 54.

01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:26.760
Thank you.

01:14:26.760 --> 01:14:29.520
Ah, freak out.

01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:31.080
All right, son, I can't.

01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:33.720
Welcome to 1985.

01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:34.560
Is it Eliza Minnelli?

01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:36.840
Because as a little boy growing up in the 80s,

01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:41.160
I knew that was the place where people got laid in public.

01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:44.600
All right, so you're OK?

01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:45.360
Is that your fantasy?

01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:46.400
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:48.080
Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me.

01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:52.800
Hey, only famous people could come into Studio 54.

01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:53.400
How famous?

01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:56.080
Let me see your credentials, sir.

01:14:56.080 --> 01:14:57.280
Hey, you don't have to take that.

01:14:57.280 --> 01:14:58.080
Excuse me, sir.

01:14:58.080 --> 01:15:00.480
I'm from Variety.

01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:03.560
My camera just broke from his fame.

01:15:03.560 --> 01:15:05.040
Well, excuse me.

01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:07.960
Allow me to take the velvet rope off of there.

01:15:07.960 --> 01:15:09.640
And you can come right in, sir.

01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:10.640
Come in, sir.

01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:13.360
Sir, you're coming in.

01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:14.360
Come in now.

01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:15.800
Don't drink that water.

01:15:15.800 --> 01:15:16.880
Get in here now.

01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:18.640
Thank you for letting me take your picture.

01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:21.880
I'm sorry, my camera wasn't good enough.

01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:25.000
Sir, here's your complimentary mirror and Coke straw.

01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:30.120
Enjoy yourself tonight.

01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:30.760
It's good for you.

01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:32.720
Cocaine, 80s.

01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:34.040
Hello, sir.

01:15:34.040 --> 01:15:35.520
In accordance with new house rules,

01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:38.040
you have been presented with an additional mirror, one that

01:15:38.040 --> 01:15:41.720
won't have so much Coke on it that you can't see yourself.

01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:43.760
What's wrong with my mirror?

01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:46.720
The manager suggested we give them two mirrors from now on,

01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:49.720
Stephanie.

01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:51.040
Oh, that makes sense.

01:15:51.040 --> 01:15:52.160
I'll go back to my business.

01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:54.080
I'm sorry.

01:15:54.080 --> 01:15:56.480
No, Stephanie, I wasn't coming down on that.

01:15:56.480 --> 01:15:58.000
Well, your attitude was a little bit,

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.120
I was talking about this later in the car at home.

01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:00.720
Sight bar.

01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:03.120
We'll talk about it later.

01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:05.560
Please, Ryan, just do some Coke and fuck somebody.

01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:07.240
It's such a typical night.

01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:09.240
It's such a typical night at the 54.

01:16:09.240 --> 01:16:11.360
It's shit like this goes down all the time.

01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:11.860
Exactly.

01:16:11.860 --> 01:16:13.560
I'm sorry to interrupt you on your date,

01:16:13.560 --> 01:16:17.680
but I am a cocaine dealer, and I deal only in mirrorless Coke.

01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:25.840
Like red Coke?

01:16:25.840 --> 01:16:28.080
What does that mean?

01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:29.960
And I just vanished into a puff of smoke.

01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:36.160
And then where I was standing, there's just a mirror laying

01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:37.520
on it.

01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:41.760
Ryan, hey, Ryan, it's me, your reflection in the mirror.

01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:46.600
This is too many make-em-up hijinks.

01:16:46.600 --> 01:16:47.480
I can handle it.

01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:48.960
I don't know why I'm going into this.

01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:52.880
Ryan, hey, it's me, your reflection.

01:16:52.880 --> 01:16:55.360
Why are you sitting on the sidelines?

01:16:55.360 --> 01:16:57.560
You're all too funny with your improbability.

01:16:57.560 --> 01:16:59.040
Ryan, it's just me, Ryan.

01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:00.760
I can't get into this.

01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:03.120
Just focus on your reflection.

01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:06.080
Sir, Ryan, Mr. Ridley, would you like me to have this?

01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:08.600
Would you like me to have this mirror removed?

01:17:08.600 --> 01:17:10.360
Is this mirror bothering you?

01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:12.240
Are you afraid to look in your own reflection, sir?

01:17:12.240 --> 01:17:14.000
I'll have this mirror removed, if you like.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:14.500
Hi.

01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:20.840
You must be Ryan.

01:17:20.840 --> 01:17:21.680
I like this.

01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:26.400
This is when it gets good.

01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:28.240
Yeah.

01:17:28.240 --> 01:17:28.840
Hi.

01:17:28.840 --> 01:17:29.960
Hi.

01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:30.880
Andromeda?

01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:31.380
Yes.

01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:35.920
Andromeda girl, we leave, and you

01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:38.760
going to be OK to get home by yourself.

01:17:38.760 --> 01:17:39.680
Yes, sir.

01:17:39.680 --> 01:17:41.200
Thank you for bringing me here.

01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:42.480
He looks OK to me.

01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:44.760
OK.

01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:49.480
Come on, Andy Warhol and James Brown.

01:17:49.480 --> 01:17:52.160
Ryan, Ryan, Ryan, it's me.

01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:53.400
It's me, your reflection.

01:17:53.400 --> 01:17:54.400
I can sit.

01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:55.120
I'm still here.

01:17:55.120 --> 01:17:58.200
I'm not going until I at least finish this bit here.

01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:02.480
Talk to her.

01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:03.760
Talk to her.

01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:05.160
You look great.

01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:08.280
Oh, thank you.

01:18:08.280 --> 01:18:11.760
I know I'm not supposed to wear this type of clothing

01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:12.640
after this date.

01:18:15.640 --> 01:18:16.920
Just placeholder.

01:18:16.920 --> 01:18:20.600
Someone will do a pass that understands fashion.

01:18:20.600 --> 01:18:23.960
A paparazzo walks by the camera and says,

01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:26.040
oh, oh, sorry, can I get a picture of Ryan Ridley

01:18:26.040 --> 01:18:29.280
and female Ed 209 from Robocop?

01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:30.440
Ryan, get close.

01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:31.280
Get closer.

01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:35.280
I was picturing Twinkie from Buck Rogers.

01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:36.280
Twinkie.

01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:37.280
Twinkie.

01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:38.280
Twinkie.

01:18:38.280 --> 01:18:39.280
Twinkie.

01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:40.280
Twinkie.

01:18:40.280 --> 01:18:41.280
Both of you guys are wrong.

01:18:41.280 --> 01:18:42.280
Twinkie.

01:18:42.280 --> 01:18:47.280
Twinkie is blowing earth, wind, and fire right now.

01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:49.280
So maybe there's someone else.

01:18:49.280 --> 01:18:50.280
Hey, Ryan.

01:18:50.280 --> 01:18:51.280
Hey, Ryan.

01:18:51.280 --> 01:18:53.280
Ryan, this is your reflection.

01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:54.280
I'm just going to go.

01:18:54.280 --> 01:18:55.280
I'm just going to leave.

01:18:55.280 --> 01:18:56.280
I'm just going to leave.

01:18:56.280 --> 01:18:57.280
Goodbye.

01:18:57.280 --> 01:18:58.280
Don't let your reflection leave.

01:18:58.280 --> 01:19:00.280
Aren't you going to ask me to sit down?

01:19:00.280 --> 01:19:02.280
Please sit, please.

01:19:02.280 --> 01:19:09.280
Do you mind if I cross and uncloss my spandex covered legs?

01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:12.280
I don't mind at all.

01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:17.280
In fact, I don't want to say insist because that's gross.

01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:20.280
But whatever makes you feel comfortable.

01:19:20.280 --> 01:19:22.280
He's so down to earth.

01:19:22.280 --> 01:19:24.280
Sorry.

01:19:24.280 --> 01:19:28.280
I understand you.

01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:30.280
He's so down to earth.

01:19:30.280 --> 01:19:33.280
He's carrying Mick Jagger walks by.

01:19:33.280 --> 01:19:36.280
He's so down to earth.

01:19:36.280 --> 01:19:38.280
He just walks out with him.

01:19:38.280 --> 01:19:41.280
Tell me about yourself.

01:19:41.280 --> 01:19:43.280
I mean, you know.

01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:47.280
Everything.

01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:49.280
You don't have to say what's to tell.

01:19:49.280 --> 01:19:50.280
What's to tell?

01:19:50.280 --> 01:19:55.280
What you see is what you get.

01:19:55.280 --> 01:19:57.280
But you, how about you?

01:19:57.280 --> 01:19:58.280
How was your drive?

01:19:58.280 --> 01:20:03.280
It was wonderful.

01:20:03.280 --> 01:20:05.280
It's such a good question.

01:20:05.280 --> 01:20:08.280
Let it go, Brandon.

01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:12.280
I love driving.

01:20:12.280 --> 01:20:15.280
I loved this drive.

01:20:15.280 --> 01:20:17.280
Oh, wait, am I?

01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:19.280
Oh, okay.

01:20:19.280 --> 01:20:22.280
Sorry.

01:20:22.280 --> 01:20:26.280
Not that that matters.

01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:31.280
I love driving and I came up Sunset and it was great.

01:20:31.280 --> 01:20:35.280
How was your drive?

01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:37.280
She took Sunset all the way to New York City.

01:20:37.280 --> 01:20:39.280
That's what I was going to say.

01:20:39.280 --> 01:20:42.280
It really broke the reality for me when he said that.

01:20:42.280 --> 01:20:43.280
That's a long drive.

01:20:43.280 --> 01:20:45.280
That's a commitment.

01:20:45.280 --> 01:20:46.280
That really means she must care about it.

01:20:46.280 --> 01:20:51.280
This is your fantasy?

01:20:51.280 --> 01:20:53.280
This is what you want to happen.

01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:55.280
Listen, man, Spencer, I just go with the flow, man.

01:20:55.280 --> 01:20:56.280
You've got to learn to do that sometimes.

01:20:56.280 --> 01:20:59.280
Studio 54 is in New York?

01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:00.280
Yes.

01:21:00.280 --> 01:21:01.280
I thought I was in L.A.

01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:02.280
No, no.

01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:03.280
It's not.

01:21:03.280 --> 01:21:05.280
It's on 54th Street.

01:21:05.280 --> 01:21:07.280
There's one of those in L.A.

01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:10.280
I went, I went there as a kid because when I was like 10 or 11,

01:21:10.280 --> 01:21:13.280
because I was in a show, and I looked back and like,

01:21:13.280 --> 01:21:17.280
why did everybody keep putting their heads down on the table?

01:21:17.280 --> 01:21:19.280
And I thought, oh, they're all like,

01:21:19.280 --> 01:21:21.280
there's a weird thing that people kept doing that.

01:21:21.280 --> 01:21:23.280
And that's what a disco nap is.

01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:25.280
They were all just going down and snorting coke.

01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:27.280
And that's also why everybody hated me,

01:21:27.280 --> 01:21:30.280
because I was a 10-year-old in a fucking club.

01:21:30.280 --> 01:21:32.280
Let's get back to the scene.

01:21:32.280 --> 01:21:34.280
Well, maybe this...

01:21:34.280 --> 01:21:37.280
Let's get back to the scene here.

01:21:37.280 --> 01:21:39.280
Also, fucking Ben Vereen was there,

01:21:39.280 --> 01:21:41.280
and he fucking treated me like a piece of shit.

01:21:41.280 --> 01:21:43.280
I'm glad he got hit by that car.

01:21:43.280 --> 01:21:46.280
You got a lot of issues.

01:21:46.280 --> 01:21:48.280
Do you know how to get to Malibu?

01:21:48.280 --> 01:21:52.280
You take PCH and make a right when you hit Ben Vereen.

01:21:52.280 --> 01:21:54.280
All right.

01:21:54.280 --> 01:21:56.280
All right.

01:21:56.280 --> 01:21:58.280
As a black man, I'll allow it.

01:21:58.280 --> 01:22:00.280
Yes.

01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:02.280
I hope it's okay.

01:22:02.280 --> 01:22:04.280
I brought Jeff Davis.

01:22:07.280 --> 01:22:09.280
More than Marrior.

01:22:09.280 --> 01:22:10.280
Hey, excuse me.

01:22:10.280 --> 01:22:12.280
You want to dance?

01:22:12.280 --> 01:22:14.280
No, Mark Wahlberg.

01:22:14.280 --> 01:22:16.280
I don't.

01:22:16.280 --> 01:22:18.280
Come on. Why don't you want to dance with me?

01:22:18.280 --> 01:22:20.280
I think you're a wonderful man,

01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:23.280
and I'm with Ryan Ridley on a date.

01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:26.280
It doesn't seem like he's talking to you much.

01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:29.280
I beg your pardon, but that's none of your business.

01:22:29.280 --> 01:22:31.280
Okay, well, you know...

01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:33.280
I'll dance with somebody else.

01:22:33.280 --> 01:22:36.280
Hey, Spencer, do you want to dance with me?

01:22:36.280 --> 01:22:38.280
I'm Jeremy Renner.

01:22:38.280 --> 01:22:40.280
Hey.

01:22:40.280 --> 01:22:42.280
You guys want some water?

01:22:42.280 --> 01:22:44.280
You guys need some water?

01:22:44.280 --> 01:22:46.280
Hey, I like that callback. Why don't you dance with me?

01:22:46.280 --> 01:22:48.280
Jeremy Renner.

01:22:48.280 --> 01:22:50.280
There's a very famous people in here.

01:22:50.280 --> 01:22:52.280
There's a very anachronistic version of Club 54, too.

01:22:52.280 --> 01:22:54.280
Why would you say that?

01:22:54.280 --> 01:22:56.280
Because you're staring at Charles Courault?

01:22:56.280 --> 01:22:58.280
Oh, shit.

01:22:58.280 --> 01:23:01.280
Newsmen from the early 80s

01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:04.280
who apparently no one remembers.

01:23:07.280 --> 01:23:10.280
It's me, Charles Courault.

01:23:10.280 --> 01:23:12.280
I dare you to Google who that is.

01:23:14.280 --> 01:23:17.280
He actually turned out to be a polygamist, right?

01:23:17.280 --> 01:23:19.280
You're exactly right.

01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:23.280
I'm so...

01:23:23.280 --> 01:23:25.280
horny?

01:23:25.280 --> 01:23:27.280
No.

01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:29.280
Okay, no.

01:23:29.280 --> 01:23:31.280
No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:23:31.280 --> 01:23:33.280
Let's take it slow in Dramata.

01:23:33.280 --> 01:23:35.280
Let's get to know each other.

01:23:35.280 --> 01:23:38.280
I'm so interested in your...

01:23:38.280 --> 01:23:41.280
drive over here.

01:23:43.280 --> 01:23:45.280
Let's talk about your drive.

01:23:45.280 --> 01:23:47.280
Are we already, Dick?

01:23:47.280 --> 01:23:49.280
No, baby.

01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:51.280
I would never say baby.

01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:55.280
Are you a robot?

01:23:59.280 --> 01:24:01.280
I am a robot.

01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:05.280
Is that offensive?

01:24:05.280 --> 01:24:07.280
Something like a phenomenon.

01:24:07.280 --> 01:24:09.280
I don't want you to be anything in Dramata.

01:24:09.280 --> 01:24:11.280
What are you?

01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:13.280
I'm a robot.

01:24:13.280 --> 01:24:15.280
Are you sure you're a robot?

01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:17.280
I'm trying to feel you out.

01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:19.280
This is your fantasy.

01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:21.280
Do you want me to be a robot?

01:24:21.280 --> 01:24:23.280
I think we're at a standoff.

01:24:23.280 --> 01:24:25.280
It's last call.

01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:27.280
It's 5.30 a.m.

01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:29.280
It's last call, everybody.

01:24:29.280 --> 01:24:31.280
You don't have to stay here.

01:24:31.280 --> 01:24:33.280
I am a robot and I'm tired of being one.

01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:35.280
Slice, stab, machine gun.

01:24:35.280 --> 01:24:37.280
No feelings, no government.

01:24:37.280 --> 01:24:39.280
This is my fantasy.

01:24:39.280 --> 01:24:41.280
This is my fantasy.

01:24:41.280 --> 01:24:43.280
I'm really discovery clown.

01:24:43.280 --> 01:24:45.280
I'm trendy Newton.

01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:47.280
I can monopolize everything.

01:24:47.280 --> 01:24:49.280
I can climb walls.

01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:51.280
I am lowering my guilt index.

01:24:55.280 --> 01:24:57.280
I can kick your head off.

01:24:57.280 --> 01:24:59.280
I am a crazy, runaway job.

01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:01.280
A sexy robot.

01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:03.280
But I love Ryan Ridley.

01:25:05.280 --> 01:25:07.280
You want to kill everybody.

01:25:07.280 --> 01:25:08.280
Right there!

01:25:08.280 --> 01:25:10.280
I must kill Ryan Ridley!

01:25:11.280 --> 01:25:13.280
Yo! I must kill Ryan Ridley!

01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:16.280
I'm not rapping, is it?

01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:20.280
I gotta kill Ryan Ridley!

01:25:20.280 --> 01:25:21.280
Okay, and then you come or...?

01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:22.280
Okay, so romantic.

01:25:22.280 --> 01:25:24.280
Yeah, it's so romantic.

01:25:25.280 --> 01:25:27.280
Wait, you wanna kill that cook robot?

01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:31.280
Man, if you don't get it, then...

01:25:32.280 --> 01:25:33.280
He just said, he wants to...

01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:35.280
Look, here's what I'm getting.

01:25:35.280 --> 01:25:36.280
You wanna react to stuff.

01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:37.280
You need like a...

01:25:37.280 --> 01:25:38.280
You want like a...

01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:40.280
Like a...

01:25:40.280 --> 01:25:41.280
What do you call it?

01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:43.280
What was it?

01:25:43.280 --> 01:25:44.280
A Madonna?

01:25:45.280 --> 01:25:47.280
When the griffin' done and the...

01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:48.280
After hours?

01:25:48.280 --> 01:25:50.280
No, no, the other thing.

01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:52.280
Susan?

01:25:52.280 --> 01:25:54.280
That's really seeking Susan.

01:25:54.280 --> 01:25:55.280
No, but...

01:25:55.280 --> 01:25:56.280
That was the...

01:25:56.280 --> 01:25:57.280
You need...

01:25:57.280 --> 01:25:59.280
Yeah, you want like a manic pixie fucking thing.

01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:00.280
What?

01:26:00.280 --> 01:26:01.280
No.

01:26:01.280 --> 01:26:02.280
Grow up, dude.

01:26:02.280 --> 01:26:05.280
I want a woman who's intelligent, strong,

01:26:05.280 --> 01:26:06.280
has her shit together.

01:26:06.280 --> 01:26:07.280
They're hidden figures.

01:26:07.280 --> 01:26:08.280
No.

01:26:08.280 --> 01:26:09.280
I know what I'm saying.

01:26:09.280 --> 01:26:10.280
There's a...

01:26:10.280 --> 01:26:11.280
I would love...

01:26:12.280 --> 01:26:14.280
I would love to date a woman.

01:26:14.280 --> 01:26:17.280
They're so strong that the shit that they had to put up with apparently...

01:26:17.280 --> 01:26:18.280
Yeah.

01:26:18.280 --> 01:26:19.280
Now, this is your kind of lady.

01:26:19.280 --> 01:26:20.280
Absolutely.

01:26:20.280 --> 01:26:21.280
A NASA...

01:26:21.280 --> 01:26:22.280
NASA?

01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:23.280
Mathematician.

01:26:23.280 --> 01:26:24.280
Mmm, a nice piece of NASA.

01:26:24.280 --> 01:26:25.280
Yeah, absolutely.

01:26:25.280 --> 01:26:27.280
A nice piece of NASA.

01:26:27.280 --> 01:26:31.280
Did you think that maybe you would find a more intelligent

01:26:31.280 --> 01:26:34.280
and independent woman by seeking out women on this site?

01:26:34.280 --> 01:26:35.280
Hey, listen.

01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:39.280
You gotta cast a wide net, you know what I'm saying?

01:26:39.280 --> 01:26:43.280
But this net seems sort of singular and elitist.

01:26:43.280 --> 01:26:44.280
Just...

01:26:44.280 --> 01:26:46.280
I'm just wondering.

01:26:46.280 --> 01:26:49.280
You find love in the strangest places.

01:26:49.280 --> 01:26:50.280
Right.

01:26:50.280 --> 01:26:51.280
Okay.

01:26:51.280 --> 01:26:56.280
Listen, if there's a riot for scientists, please let me know.

01:26:56.280 --> 01:26:58.280
I'll sign up for that, too.

01:26:58.280 --> 01:27:02.280
It's called going out in the world where scientists live.

01:27:02.280 --> 01:27:04.280
You should have gone to the...

01:27:04.280 --> 01:27:06.280
You should have gone to the March for Science downtown.

01:27:06.280 --> 01:27:10.280
It was mostly smart women down there.

01:27:10.280 --> 01:27:14.280
Every university has a coffee shop.

01:27:14.280 --> 01:27:15.280
All right.

01:27:15.280 --> 01:27:17.280
Is there a scientist in the audience?

01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:18.280
I did think about that, actually.

01:27:18.280 --> 01:27:20.280
I did think about that.

01:27:20.280 --> 01:27:21.280
Trying to meet...

01:27:21.280 --> 01:27:23.280
But that's a shitty reason to go March.

01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:25.280
No, and you could volunteer for that.

01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:27.280
Are you telling me I shouldn't go to church to meet women?

01:27:27.280 --> 01:27:29.280
For scientific tests?

01:27:29.280 --> 01:27:31.280
You could do like a sleep apnea test?

01:27:31.280 --> 01:27:32.280
Something tells me...

01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:36.280
You know, they're not just letting undergrads run those things.

01:27:36.280 --> 01:27:37.280
There's some scientists in there.

01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:38.280
Oh, really?

01:27:38.280 --> 01:27:39.280
Oh, yeah.

01:27:39.280 --> 01:27:40.280
Scientists are watching you sleep.

01:27:40.280 --> 01:27:41.280
You could volunteer.

01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:42.280
I know.

01:27:42.280 --> 01:27:43.280
I probably...

01:27:43.280 --> 01:27:44.280
Or they're getting their PhD.

01:27:44.280 --> 01:27:46.280
Do you want them to have PhDs?

01:27:46.280 --> 01:27:50.280
That's not the most exciting area of expertise, frankly.

01:27:50.280 --> 01:27:52.280
You're more like NASA...

01:27:52.280 --> 01:27:53.280
Yeah, cosmic.

01:27:53.280 --> 01:27:55.280
Like someone who worked on the Land Rover.

01:27:55.280 --> 01:27:56.280
So you're angling for...

01:27:56.280 --> 01:27:57.280
The Land Rover.

01:27:57.280 --> 01:27:58.280
The Mars Rover.

01:27:58.280 --> 01:27:59.280
A hot...

01:27:59.280 --> 01:28:01.280
I'll take someone who works at Land Rover over here.

01:28:01.280 --> 01:28:04.280
Oh, because I was going to say, yeah, the guy who worked on my Land Rover has got a daughter.

01:28:04.280 --> 01:28:05.280
Yeah.

01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:07.280
I can't believe they put a Land Rover on March.

01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:09.280
That was amazing.

01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:14.280
Because you think that the English car companies wouldn't be able to afford that.

01:28:14.280 --> 01:28:17.280
Steve Levy!

01:28:17.280 --> 01:28:23.280
Hey Steve, what do you think of the fact that everyone's making me a big joke up here, huh?

01:28:23.280 --> 01:28:26.280
My pursuit of love is just a big joke to be mocked.

01:28:26.280 --> 01:28:27.280
What do you think of that, Steve?

01:28:27.280 --> 01:28:29.280
Is that about love in general or you?

01:28:29.280 --> 01:28:30.280
No!

01:28:30.280 --> 01:28:33.280
But everybody's making a big joke about my pursuit of love.

01:28:33.280 --> 01:28:34.280
What do you think about that?

01:28:34.280 --> 01:28:36.280
I mean, I'm sorry.

01:28:36.280 --> 01:28:37.280
Steve!

01:28:37.280 --> 01:28:38.280
Hey Steve!

01:28:38.280 --> 01:28:39.280
Hey Steve!

01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:40.280
Hey Rob.

01:28:40.280 --> 01:28:41.280
Steve, do you date a lot?

01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:42.280
Who's here?

01:28:42.280 --> 01:28:43.280
No.

01:28:43.280 --> 01:28:44.280
Why not?

01:28:44.280 --> 01:28:45.280
That guy likes me.

01:28:45.280 --> 01:28:46.280
Hey John Carman, everybody!

01:28:46.280 --> 01:28:47.280
Who's...

01:28:47.280 --> 01:28:48.280
Oh, sorry.

01:28:48.280 --> 01:28:51.280
He's the Steve Levy of Justin Roiland.

01:28:51.280 --> 01:28:53.280
I know, but it's...

01:28:53.280 --> 01:28:56.280
Alright, John Carman, stand up here so they can see the joke.

01:28:56.280 --> 01:28:57.280
We'll get to my question later.

01:28:57.280 --> 01:28:59.280
I don't date to answer your question.

01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:00.280
Hold on.

01:29:00.280 --> 01:29:05.280
Now, since Steve Levy gave me such a dissatisfying answer, John Carman, what do you think about

01:29:05.280 --> 01:29:10.280
all these jokers making a big old funny thing about my pursuit of love?

01:29:10.280 --> 01:29:12.280
Use your own mic.

01:29:12.280 --> 01:29:15.280
Look, Ryan, I'm in the same boat as you, so...

01:29:15.280 --> 01:29:21.280
I was picturing myself in your position at Studio 54 and it was just, you know, I would've

01:29:21.280 --> 01:29:22.280
done the same thing.

01:29:22.280 --> 01:29:26.280
He doesn't seem like I got Levy and then Justin got Synthetic Levy.

01:29:26.280 --> 01:29:28.280
That's what I always call it.

01:29:28.280 --> 01:29:29.280
You didn't even learn my name.

01:29:29.280 --> 01:29:30.280
That's all you called me at work.

01:29:30.280 --> 01:29:31.280
Synthetic Levy.

01:29:31.280 --> 01:29:32.280
Yeah.

01:29:32.280 --> 01:29:35.280
But you hung in there.

01:29:35.280 --> 01:29:38.280
You didn't go like, Synthetic Levy, I'm outta here.

01:29:38.280 --> 01:29:41.280
You're like, okay, I guess that's my name.

01:29:41.280 --> 01:29:43.280
He's Justin Roiland's assistant.

01:29:43.280 --> 01:29:46.280
I'd say his skin is pretty thick and his brain is pretty...

01:29:46.280 --> 01:29:47.280
Thick.

01:29:47.280 --> 01:29:48.280
...bordified?

01:29:48.280 --> 01:29:49.280
Careful.

01:29:49.280 --> 01:29:51.280
You would not believe the shit you're seeing.

01:29:51.280 --> 01:29:53.280
You're Justin Roiland's assistant?

01:29:53.280 --> 01:29:54.280
I am.

01:29:54.280 --> 01:29:56.280
Take us, like...

01:29:56.280 --> 01:29:57.280
How much...

01:29:57.280 --> 01:29:58.280
It's 10 o'clock.

01:29:58.280 --> 01:29:59.280
How much...

01:29:59.280 --> 01:30:00.280
I have to get up in the morning.

01:30:00.280 --> 01:30:01.280
I have to go to a meeting.

01:30:01.280 --> 01:30:02.280
What meeting am I supposed to go to?

01:30:02.280 --> 01:30:03.280
What am I doing right now?

01:30:03.280 --> 01:30:04.280
Somebody tell me what I'm supposed to do.

01:30:04.280 --> 01:30:06.280
I need some kind of Rubik's snake to put together.

01:30:06.280 --> 01:30:07.280
What am I doing?

01:30:07.280 --> 01:30:08.280
What am I doing?

01:30:08.280 --> 01:30:10.280
Somebody tell me what I'm supposed to do.

01:30:10.280 --> 01:30:11.280
You have a boy.

01:30:11.280 --> 01:30:12.280
I'm a boy.

01:30:12.280 --> 01:30:13.280
I'm a boy.

01:30:13.280 --> 01:30:14.280
I'm a boy.

01:30:14.280 --> 01:30:15.280
I'm a boy.

01:30:15.280 --> 01:30:16.280
I'm a boy.

01:30:16.280 --> 01:30:17.280
I'm a boy.

01:30:17.280 --> 01:30:18.280
I'm a boy.

01:30:18.280 --> 01:30:19.280
I'm a boy.

01:30:19.280 --> 01:30:20.280
I'm a boy.

01:30:20.280 --> 01:30:21.280
I'm a boy.

01:30:21.280 --> 01:30:22.280
What am I supposed to do?

01:30:22.280 --> 01:30:24.280
You have more information on those Nintendo sales.

01:30:24.280 --> 01:30:25.280
What's going on?

01:30:25.280 --> 01:30:27.280
I need more Nintendo products.

01:30:27.280 --> 01:30:29.280
I need to VR this shit.

01:30:29.280 --> 01:30:30.280
What the fuck is going...

01:30:30.280 --> 01:30:32.280
what the fuck is going on with my life?

01:30:32.280 --> 01:30:34.280
Which line are you standing in right now?

01:30:34.280 --> 01:30:35.280
Are you st...

01:30:35.280 --> 01:30:37.280
I photo the Nintendo.

01:30:37.280 --> 01:30:38.280
Somebody walk...

01:30:38.280 --> 01:30:40.280
all of my dogs.

01:30:40.280 --> 01:30:46.280
Somebody needs to walk all of my 900 dogs.

01:30:46.280 --> 01:30:48.280
Please, somebody walk my dogs.

01:30:48.280 --> 01:30:49.280
Where are my dogs?

01:30:49.280 --> 01:30:53.000
Dogs, somebody walk my dogs, my dogs need to be walking.

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:56.600
My walking dogs, why aren't you walking my dogs, Marty?

01:30:59.480 --> 01:31:03.080
Word for word, I nearly had a stand in the overnight.

01:31:03.080 --> 01:31:04.720
Who are you talking to?

01:31:04.720 --> 01:31:06.080
Are you crazy?

01:31:06.080 --> 01:31:07.680
Is there something wrong with you?

01:31:07.680 --> 01:31:09.880
Are you fucking nuts right now?

01:31:09.880 --> 01:31:12.360
Somebody help me, I'm dying.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:15.440
All right, yeah.

01:31:15.440 --> 01:31:16.280
All right, well.

01:31:16.280 --> 01:31:17.120
Is it noon yet?

01:31:17.120 --> 01:31:18.880
Can we order lunch?

01:31:18.880 --> 01:31:22.960
That's it, that's it, that's it.

01:31:22.960 --> 01:31:24.600
Justin loves lunch.

01:31:24.600 --> 01:31:27.280
Rob, you have some weird PTSD about Justin Rayl.

01:31:30.880 --> 01:31:34.440
Wait, this, like, Levy, just, here, let me,

01:31:34.440 --> 01:31:36.480
I'm on a date with you.

01:31:36.480 --> 01:31:37.400
Don't trust that motherfucker.

01:31:37.400 --> 01:31:39.440
Oh shit, Dan's on a date with Steve Levy?

01:31:39.440 --> 01:31:42.080
Oh my God, so fucking hot, do it, do it.

01:31:42.080 --> 01:31:43.600
God, here we go.

01:31:43.600 --> 01:31:45.760
I'm gonna jerk off so hard.

01:31:45.760 --> 01:31:48.280
Dude, dude, dude, frosted edges.

01:31:48.280 --> 01:31:50.840
I'm a friend of my race and I can't see my guns impossible.

01:31:50.840 --> 01:31:54.080
Hi, are you Levy?

01:31:54.080 --> 01:31:54.920
I am.

01:31:54.920 --> 01:31:56.200
Or did you just get here?

01:31:56.200 --> 01:31:57.040
He's all.

01:31:57.040 --> 01:32:01.040
Just let it run.

01:32:01.040 --> 01:32:02.400
Bam!

01:32:02.400 --> 01:32:03.600
I'm sorry, I'm gonna shut up.

01:32:03.600 --> 01:32:05.160
Please, please, I'm gonna shut up.

01:32:05.160 --> 01:32:06.680
There's just too many.

01:32:06.680 --> 01:32:08.160
Go ahead, please.

01:32:08.160 --> 01:32:09.000
We love you, Rob.

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:10.680
Please go ahead, please, just start right now.

01:32:10.680 --> 01:32:12.560
Just, just keep, continue with the scene.

01:32:12.560 --> 01:32:13.400
I'm sorry.

01:32:13.400 --> 01:32:14.240
Just let it go.

01:32:14.240 --> 01:32:17.160
He's already well outperforming Ryan at this point.

01:32:17.160 --> 01:32:20.440
Are you, are you, are you, are you Steve Levy?

01:32:20.440 --> 01:32:21.360
Yeah.

01:32:21.360 --> 01:32:26.000
I was told by Tumber to meet you here.

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:27.400
I'm, I'm in drama though.

01:32:27.400 --> 01:32:29.200
I'm sorry, who, who?

01:32:29.200 --> 01:32:31.000
Tumber, the app that we use.

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:31.840
Oh, right.

01:32:31.840 --> 01:32:33.320
Their slogan is it's not a tumor.

01:32:35.720 --> 01:32:36.760
Because it has a B in it.

01:32:36.760 --> 01:32:37.720
It's a good start.

01:32:37.720 --> 01:32:38.720
It's spreading.

01:32:38.720 --> 01:32:47.640
It's something spreading.

01:32:47.640 --> 01:32:51.040
Did you notice the sense of wonderment in his voice?

01:32:51.040 --> 01:32:52.880
He acted, Ryan, I'm talking to you, motherfu-

01:32:52.880 --> 01:32:54.280
I was up in my head.

01:32:54.280 --> 01:32:56.120
You need to watch, because so far Steve

01:32:56.120 --> 01:32:59.560
is off to a pretty good look.

01:32:59.560 --> 01:33:00.160
Hi.

01:33:00.160 --> 01:33:01.480
Hi, Andromeda.

01:33:01.480 --> 01:33:02.240
Hi.

01:33:02.240 --> 01:33:06.000
But, so you, you tracked me down?

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
We didn't get connected?

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:11.440
Look at his establishment.

01:33:11.440 --> 01:33:14.600
No, we, I don't want to say no, because that's bad improv,

01:33:14.600 --> 01:33:18.720
but the idea is that we agreed to meet here.

01:33:18.720 --> 01:33:20.160
Oh, we did.

01:33:20.160 --> 01:33:21.520
Sorry.

01:33:21.520 --> 01:33:22.320
He apologized.

01:33:22.320 --> 01:33:26.320
I run like, I run like four calendars, including my own.

01:33:26.320 --> 01:33:30.040
It's really, it's hard to keep up with everything.

01:33:30.040 --> 01:33:31.280
Why is that her problem?

01:33:31.280 --> 01:33:39.600
Listen, let me tell you upfront, if we're going to start dating,

01:33:39.600 --> 01:33:43.320
I'm not going to have very much time for you.

01:33:43.320 --> 01:33:45.800
Why are you, is your job important to you?

01:33:45.800 --> 01:33:48.560
My job is, I'm a workaholic.

01:33:48.560 --> 01:33:50.640
Well, maybe it's worth that.

01:33:50.640 --> 01:33:53.320
Tell me more about what you do for a living,

01:33:53.320 --> 01:33:57.000
and I could probably support it.

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:58.800
So I work in television.

01:33:58.800 --> 01:34:04.320
And for the showrunner, writer, producer,

01:34:04.320 --> 01:34:05.320
he's a really good guy.

01:34:05.320 --> 01:34:06.320
Joss Whedon?

01:34:06.320 --> 01:34:08.480
No.

01:34:08.480 --> 01:34:09.080
No, no.

01:34:09.080 --> 01:34:09.880
Who is it?

01:34:09.880 --> 01:34:12.040
He's very, very, very generous.

01:34:12.040 --> 01:34:13.120
Excuse me, hold on.

01:34:13.120 --> 01:34:14.400
Sorry.

01:34:14.400 --> 01:34:16.720
Hello.

01:34:16.720 --> 01:34:22.120
Steve, I can't figure out what's,

01:34:22.120 --> 01:34:24.480
trying to figure out how to get, how am I supposed,

01:34:24.480 --> 01:34:27.240
I can't watch the Apple TV right now.

01:34:27.240 --> 01:34:28.960
It's insane that you're calling me.

01:34:28.960 --> 01:34:30.120
I know, but you.

01:34:30.120 --> 01:34:31.960
It has to be really bad if you're calling me.

01:34:31.960 --> 01:34:34.200
I can't get the Apple TV to work.

01:34:34.200 --> 01:34:37.640
I want to watch this thing, and I don't know what the fuck is

01:34:37.640 --> 01:34:38.200
going on here.

01:34:38.200 --> 01:34:42.640
Will you please just, just fix it for me.

01:34:42.640 --> 01:34:45.840
I'm going to email text and call them, don't worry.

01:34:45.840 --> 01:34:47.360
Just fucking take care of it.

01:34:47.360 --> 01:34:50.520
Someone will be there at the latest in the morning.

01:34:50.520 --> 01:34:51.680
It's 11 o'clock at night.

01:34:51.680 --> 01:34:53.160
I'll see if they can send somebody.

01:34:53.160 --> 01:34:59.680
Can you get me something salty and sweet?

01:34:59.680 --> 01:35:02.120
I know, I know it's, it's two different things,

01:35:02.120 --> 01:35:03.520
but just fucking can't do it.

01:35:03.520 --> 01:35:06.360
I left that bag of chocolate pretzels for exactly this

01:35:06.360 --> 01:35:07.880
reason.

01:35:07.880 --> 01:35:12.080
Can I just say that he never complained

01:35:12.080 --> 01:35:18.160
that he's just letting you know if his TV

01:35:18.160 --> 01:35:20.160
breaks at 11 at night, that's when you're

01:35:20.160 --> 01:35:22.560
going to find out, motherfucker.

01:35:22.560 --> 01:35:25.440
It doesn't mean you have to fix it at 11 at night,

01:35:25.440 --> 01:35:30.040
but you sure as fuck going to know when it breaks.

01:35:30.040 --> 01:35:30.960
That's not your problem.

01:35:30.960 --> 01:35:31.720
You could not.

01:35:31.720 --> 01:35:33.480
And you're on the nose.

01:35:33.480 --> 01:35:34.720
She's in the nose.

01:35:34.720 --> 01:35:41.040
Anyway, I just, I just admire you for supporting someone who

01:35:41.040 --> 01:35:44.440
is a TV show runner, which means they probably paid their dues.

01:35:44.440 --> 01:35:46.880
Yeah, yeah.

01:35:46.880 --> 01:35:49.160
I think that's.

01:35:49.160 --> 01:35:51.920
Excuse me, one second for a minute.

01:35:51.920 --> 01:35:52.440
Hello?

01:35:52.440 --> 01:35:56.320
Where the fuck is my assistant, god damn it?

01:35:56.320 --> 01:35:57.960
I've been slept in three days.

01:35:57.960 --> 01:35:58.520
I don't know.

01:35:58.520 --> 01:36:00.520
Where's my assistant?

01:36:00.520 --> 01:36:01.440
Oh, jeez.

01:36:01.440 --> 01:36:03.000
Where's my fucking assistant?

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.200
He's not picking up my fucking phone.

01:36:05.200 --> 01:36:08.120
Is that Justin Roiland's voice on your phone?

01:36:08.120 --> 01:36:10.960
Yeah, the Justin Roiland is calling me.

01:36:10.960 --> 01:36:12.080
He calls you?

01:36:12.080 --> 01:36:14.160
Where's my fucking assistant?

01:36:14.160 --> 01:36:16.640
I'm trying to find my fucking assistant.

01:36:16.640 --> 01:36:17.720
Sister is fucking.

01:36:17.720 --> 01:36:20.600
Excuse me, I have a call.

01:36:20.600 --> 01:36:22.920
Hello?

01:36:22.920 --> 01:36:23.920
Hi, this is Chevy Chase.

01:36:23.920 --> 01:36:25.920
I was trying to get a hold of Dan Harmon's assistant.

01:36:25.920 --> 01:36:27.080
Chevy Chase.

01:36:27.080 --> 01:36:29.240
Chevy Chase is a Chevy Chase.

01:36:29.240 --> 01:36:29.880
Hi, Fletch.

01:36:29.880 --> 01:36:30.600
How you doing?

01:36:30.600 --> 01:36:32.080
Chevy Chase, Fletch?

01:36:32.080 --> 01:36:33.440
Hey, Fletch, Chevy Chase.

01:36:33.440 --> 01:36:35.920
How you doing, Chevy Chase, Fletch?

01:36:35.920 --> 01:36:38.320
I really enjoy your Fletch, Chevy Chase.

01:36:38.320 --> 01:36:40.200
Are you Justin Roiland?

01:36:40.200 --> 01:36:42.240
This is Justin Roiland, Fletch Chase.

01:36:42.240 --> 01:36:43.640
You're Justin Roiland.

01:36:43.640 --> 01:36:45.440
Yeah, you're not, you're not fat.

01:36:45.440 --> 01:36:46.560
And you're a good rider.

01:36:46.560 --> 01:36:48.200
Thank you very much, Chevy Chase.

01:36:48.200 --> 01:36:50.160
I just called him to say you're not fat

01:36:50.160 --> 01:36:51.000
and you're a great rider.

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:52.160
I'm a big fan.

01:36:52.160 --> 01:36:53.080
I love your Fletch, Chase.

01:36:53.080 --> 01:36:54.160
I love working with you.

01:36:54.160 --> 01:36:55.360
It's a pleasure to know you.

01:36:55.360 --> 01:36:59.040
And I want to call up to say, if you ever want to hang out

01:36:59.040 --> 01:37:00.400
and watch Grudge or the Wings.

01:37:00.400 --> 01:37:02.320
Yes, come over right now, Chevy Chase.

01:37:02.320 --> 01:37:04.440
I'll come right over and watch it with you.

01:37:04.440 --> 01:37:05.040
Chevy Chase.

01:37:05.040 --> 01:37:05.760
I got to go.

01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:06.720
I'm driving to your place.

01:37:06.720 --> 01:37:07.640
Thank you, thank you.

01:37:07.640 --> 01:37:08.560
I got to call Uber.

01:37:08.560 --> 01:37:10.200
OK, great.

01:37:10.200 --> 01:37:14.400
Holy shit, I just talked to Chevy Chase.

01:37:14.400 --> 01:37:15.080
Holy shit.

01:37:15.080 --> 01:37:15.840
I talked to Chevy Chase.

01:37:15.840 --> 01:37:17.200
Did you hear any of that?

01:37:17.200 --> 01:37:18.960
Yo, no.

01:37:18.960 --> 01:37:20.200
That's insane.

01:37:20.200 --> 01:37:22.320
Where the fuck is my assistant?

01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:24.680
He's walking the dogs.

01:37:24.680 --> 01:37:25.680
Oh, yeah, that's right.

01:37:25.680 --> 01:37:26.880
I'm sorry.

01:37:26.880 --> 01:37:27.880
Who is this?

01:37:27.880 --> 01:37:30.720
Why are you calling me?

01:37:30.720 --> 01:37:32.760
Oh.

01:37:32.760 --> 01:37:34.160
I am so sorry.

01:37:34.160 --> 01:37:34.680
It's OK.

01:37:34.680 --> 01:37:38.120
Like I said, your life is so exciting.

01:37:38.120 --> 01:37:41.160
This is honestly just like every date I'm ever on.

01:37:41.160 --> 01:37:43.600
It's because I'm always working.

01:37:43.600 --> 01:37:46.240
I don't feel sorry for you at all.

01:37:46.240 --> 01:37:48.760
I don't at all.

01:37:48.760 --> 01:37:50.880
I think it's an amazing-sounding job.

01:37:50.880 --> 01:37:53.600
I think you should be fucking thankful for every fucking

01:37:53.600 --> 01:37:54.360
method.

01:37:54.360 --> 01:37:56.760
Maybe then this could work out.

01:37:56.760 --> 01:37:58.280
It depends.

01:37:58.280 --> 01:38:01.800
I mean, if you're cool.

01:38:01.800 --> 01:38:04.840
I mean, I just think the coolest thing about it

01:38:04.840 --> 01:38:06.280
is that you take it in stride.

01:38:06.280 --> 01:38:11.880
Because I imagine that the people that are calling you,

01:38:11.880 --> 01:38:14.800
they must be special people.

01:38:14.800 --> 01:38:15.280
I'm sorry.

01:38:15.280 --> 01:38:16.280
Hold on.

01:38:16.280 --> 01:38:19.800
One second, I'm so sorry.

01:38:19.800 --> 01:38:20.680
Hello?

01:38:20.680 --> 01:38:24.360
This is Apple TV.

01:38:24.360 --> 01:38:28.080
We heard that there was a problem with your apple.

01:38:28.080 --> 01:38:31.120
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's not my apple.

01:38:31.120 --> 01:38:32.360
It's my boss's apple.

01:38:32.360 --> 01:38:34.200
Oh.

01:38:34.200 --> 01:38:37.880
What's the soonest you could be at his house to fix it?

01:38:37.880 --> 01:38:42.400
Because his girlfriend's over and they're not getting-

01:38:42.400 --> 01:38:45.000
Who's his girlfriend?

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:49.440
Excuse me, I've got a call.

01:38:49.440 --> 01:38:50.840
Hello, this is Apple TV.

01:38:50.840 --> 01:38:53.320
Hello, this is Apple TV.

01:38:53.320 --> 01:38:54.440
Hello, this is Apple TV.

01:38:54.440 --> 01:38:55.920
I must have got the lines crossed.

01:38:55.920 --> 01:38:58.200
I was trying to call my son Steve Levy.

01:38:58.200 --> 01:38:59.400
Oh.

01:38:59.400 --> 01:39:00.240
Oh, he's on the phone.

01:39:00.240 --> 01:39:01.120
Let me connect you two.

01:39:01.120 --> 01:39:01.620
Connect?

01:39:01.620 --> 01:39:02.800
Can you put his all through in a second?

01:39:02.800 --> 01:39:03.600
OK, here we go.

01:39:03.600 --> 01:39:04.080
Here we go.

01:39:04.080 --> 01:39:05.280
Let me see if I do this for you.

01:39:05.280 --> 01:39:06.760
Hello, Steve.

01:39:06.760 --> 01:39:09.480
Stephen, I'm your father from England.

01:39:09.480 --> 01:39:10.040
What?

01:39:10.040 --> 01:39:11.800
I'm your father.

01:39:11.800 --> 01:39:13.120
Yes, your father's not Jewish.

01:39:13.120 --> 01:39:15.480
He's English.

01:39:15.480 --> 01:39:16.200
Oh, man.

01:39:16.200 --> 01:39:18.240
You can be Jewish and English, you know.

01:39:18.240 --> 01:39:19.680
This is really sad to me because I

01:39:19.680 --> 01:39:23.120
saw in your dating profile that your dad died when you were 17.

01:39:23.120 --> 01:39:23.760
Yeah.

01:39:23.760 --> 01:39:24.260
Yeah.

01:39:24.260 --> 01:39:27.560
I'm calling for me right now.

01:39:27.560 --> 01:39:29.920
Hello, Steve, this is a zombie hunter.

01:39:29.920 --> 01:39:32.800
Is your dad calling or is he trying to get in touch with you?

01:39:32.800 --> 01:39:36.520
Looks like you had a zombie problem with your dad if your dad is dead.

01:39:36.520 --> 01:39:38.320
I've come back from the grave, Stephen.

01:39:38.320 --> 01:39:39.960
I've come back from the grave.

01:39:39.960 --> 01:39:40.880
Don't listen to him.

01:39:40.880 --> 01:39:42.960
To give you a piece of advice, he wants your brain.

01:39:42.960 --> 01:39:45.680
I've come back from the grave to eat your brains and give you

01:39:45.680 --> 01:39:48.000
one piece of advice.

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:49.280
Don't work for Dan Hartley.

01:39:49.280 --> 01:39:49.920
Hello, Steve.

01:39:49.920 --> 01:39:50.420
Hello.

01:39:50.420 --> 01:39:51.800
Yeah, yeah, yeah, hello.

01:39:51.800 --> 01:39:52.760
Yeah, it's Steve.

01:39:52.760 --> 01:39:53.880
It's Brandon.

01:39:53.880 --> 01:39:54.380
Brandon.

01:39:54.380 --> 01:39:55.920
Yeah, both my parents are dead.

01:39:55.920 --> 01:39:57.080
They died when I was a kid.

01:39:57.080 --> 01:39:59.720
So don't let anybody ever fuck with you about it.

01:39:59.720 --> 01:40:02.720
Brandon, I'll take that.

01:40:02.720 --> 01:40:06.760
Also, that makes me win.

01:40:06.760 --> 01:40:09.600
Hello, Brandon.

01:40:09.600 --> 01:40:10.080
Hello?

01:40:10.080 --> 01:40:11.360
Brandon, this is your father.

01:40:11.360 --> 01:40:13.000
Daddy.

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:14.080
I just lied to Steve.

01:40:14.080 --> 01:40:14.920
Leave me about you.

01:40:14.920 --> 01:40:15.920
I know you.

01:40:15.920 --> 01:40:16.920
Don't, don't ever.

01:40:16.920 --> 01:40:18.920
Steve.

01:40:18.920 --> 01:40:20.640
Hello?

01:40:20.640 --> 01:40:24.120
What the fuck is going on?

01:40:24.120 --> 01:40:25.280
What is going on here?

01:40:25.280 --> 01:40:28.240
I can't find my, I can't find anything here.

01:40:28.240 --> 01:40:30.160
I've been up for four days.

01:40:30.160 --> 01:40:33.000
I don't know what's going on.

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:34.560
What is that noise?

01:40:34.560 --> 01:40:37.640
Somebody tell me what that noise is for God's sake.

01:40:37.640 --> 01:40:41.320
Steve, this is dog the fake zombie hunter hunter.

01:40:41.320 --> 01:40:42.800
Oh my God.

01:40:42.800 --> 01:40:45.760
There's a zombie out there pretending to be a zombie hunter.

01:40:45.760 --> 01:40:47.360
Oh my God.

01:40:47.360 --> 01:40:50.680
And my boss wonders why I'm so overwhelmed.

01:40:50.680 --> 01:40:52.280
You're overwhelmed?

01:40:52.280 --> 01:40:56.040
You should try hunting fake zombie hunters.

01:40:56.040 --> 01:40:58.360
What are you, an assistant to a genius?

01:40:58.360 --> 01:41:00.640
That sounds, that's a fucking cakewalk.

01:41:00.640 --> 01:41:03.560
I dream of that job.

01:41:03.560 --> 01:41:04.160
Noted.

01:41:04.160 --> 01:41:07.840
It's worth an 11 PM text letting you know that the fucking

01:41:07.840 --> 01:41:08.960
television doesn't work.

01:41:08.960 --> 01:41:11.840
And here's why Steve.

01:41:11.840 --> 01:41:14.720
Because poor people can turn on their televisions.

01:41:14.720 --> 01:41:16.760
Poor people can turn on their televisions.

01:41:16.760 --> 01:41:17.720
I've heard this.

01:41:17.720 --> 01:41:18.560
That's true.

01:41:18.560 --> 01:41:21.760
I've been going to Best Buy right now and for $600

01:41:21.760 --> 01:41:24.440
have a device that turns on and off a TV.

01:41:24.440 --> 01:41:27.640
It's fucked up for someone to pay $200,000 for a home

01:41:27.640 --> 01:41:30.720
automation system so that they can wait for permission

01:41:30.720 --> 01:41:34.480
to watch X-Files from some dips in in Malibu.

01:41:34.480 --> 01:41:35.480
Yeah.

01:41:35.480 --> 01:41:35.980
Wow.

01:41:35.980 --> 01:41:37.240
It's emasculating.

01:41:37.240 --> 01:41:38.520
It's emasculating.

01:41:38.520 --> 01:41:40.000
I'm on his side.

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:41.200
You're as passionate as my boss.

01:41:41.200 --> 01:41:42.840
You should meet that guy.

01:41:42.840 --> 01:41:44.000
Steve, it's me.

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:45.920
There's no such thing as a fake zombie hunter.

01:41:45.920 --> 01:41:47.200
It's me.

01:41:47.200 --> 01:41:48.480
You got me again.

01:41:48.480 --> 01:41:49.840
I'm sorry, Steve.

01:41:49.840 --> 01:41:51.840
Hey, Dan, as long as you're on the phone, hey,

01:41:51.840 --> 01:41:54.000
could you talk to me for a second?

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:57.320
Justin, don't finish editing episode 304.

01:41:57.320 --> 01:41:58.520
It's the worst.

01:42:01.080 --> 01:42:01.960
That's not true.

01:42:01.960 --> 01:42:08.440
It's going to be the worst episode of Rick and

01:42:08.440 --> 01:42:08.940
Jason.

01:42:08.940 --> 01:42:09.440
It's OK.

01:42:09.440 --> 01:42:10.680
There's two good ones before it.

01:42:10.680 --> 01:42:12.560
I need to get this off my chest.

01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:15.600
You're mean to me and you hurt my feelings about that picnic

01:42:15.600 --> 01:42:17.520
thing that I did the other day.

01:42:17.520 --> 01:42:21.360
When I was doing the picnic thing, you don't even remember.

01:42:21.360 --> 01:42:23.840
No.

01:42:23.840 --> 01:42:24.960
Steve, I'm sorry.

01:42:24.960 --> 01:42:28.080
Why are you looking at me?

01:42:28.080 --> 01:42:32.240
Justin, let's try to make season four as good as we can.

01:42:32.240 --> 01:42:33.560
Andromeda, one second.

01:42:33.560 --> 01:42:36.040
I'm so sorry that this is still going on.

01:42:36.040 --> 01:42:37.160
One second.

01:42:37.160 --> 01:42:38.120
This is Chevy Chase.

01:42:38.120 --> 01:42:40.240
I'm still on the line.

01:42:40.240 --> 01:42:41.840
Should I hang up?

01:42:41.840 --> 01:42:43.960
I don't even know what's going on.

01:42:43.960 --> 01:42:45.880
I'm so drunk on Box Wine.

01:42:45.880 --> 01:42:46.520
Steve, listen.

01:42:46.520 --> 01:42:48.320
Zombie hunters are real.

01:42:48.320 --> 01:42:50.720
No one's going to tell you that's the truth.

01:42:50.720 --> 01:42:53.080
So listen to any zombie hunters telling you the truth.

01:42:53.080 --> 01:42:54.240
I love you so much.

01:42:54.240 --> 01:42:55.520
I'm so happier in my life.

01:42:55.520 --> 01:42:58.680
Do you know Chevy Chase?

01:42:58.680 --> 01:42:59.960
You know Chevy Chase?

01:42:59.960 --> 01:43:00.800
I don't.

01:43:00.800 --> 01:43:01.960
I'm sorry.

01:43:01.960 --> 01:43:03.200
But he's been on the phone.

01:43:03.200 --> 01:43:04.920
I'm still here.

01:43:04.920 --> 01:43:07.920
And Dan, is Dan still on the line?

01:43:07.920 --> 01:43:08.800
This is Andromeda.

01:43:08.800 --> 01:43:12.120
I'm just listening on speakerphone here.

01:43:12.120 --> 01:43:13.920
Andromeda, hi.

01:43:13.920 --> 01:43:18.040
Hi, Andromeda, are you sexy?

01:43:18.040 --> 01:43:18.920
Chevy, this is Dan.

01:43:18.920 --> 01:43:20.840
I'm listening.

01:43:20.840 --> 01:43:22.160
But Dan, you are here.

01:43:22.160 --> 01:43:22.640
Yeah.

01:43:22.640 --> 01:43:23.640
Hi.

01:43:23.640 --> 01:43:28.640
I just came out of my Zinfandel fueled haze.

01:43:28.640 --> 01:43:30.880
Remember the time I told you that you were just OK?

01:43:30.880 --> 01:43:31.960
Yeah.

01:43:31.960 --> 01:43:36.200
I meant you were all right.

01:43:36.200 --> 01:43:36.800
Thank you.

01:43:36.800 --> 01:43:38.760
Just all right.

01:43:38.760 --> 01:43:39.920
Just all right.

01:43:39.920 --> 01:43:41.560
Hey, Andromeda?

01:43:41.560 --> 01:43:43.080
Yes.

01:43:43.080 --> 01:43:46.240
I'm going to listen to a podcast with Cody.

01:43:46.240 --> 01:43:48.880
You have a great date with Steve.

01:43:48.880 --> 01:43:52.080
All right, Dan.

01:43:52.080 --> 01:43:53.320
And for the record?

01:43:53.320 --> 01:43:54.280
Yes.

01:43:54.280 --> 01:43:57.560
I'm glad you're not Joss Whedon.

01:43:57.560 --> 01:43:59.760
Thank you.

01:43:59.760 --> 01:44:01.880
Don't get her, Steve.

01:44:01.880 --> 01:44:03.040
Thanks, Dan.

01:44:03.040 --> 01:44:04.960
Or him or whatever.

01:44:04.960 --> 01:44:05.800
It doesn't matter.

01:44:05.800 --> 01:44:08.000
I advocate whatever it is that's going on

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:09.600
over the other end of that phone.

01:44:09.600 --> 01:44:11.280
Goodbye.

01:44:11.280 --> 01:44:12.480
Bye.

01:44:12.480 --> 01:44:13.920
So, wow.

01:44:13.920 --> 01:44:15.440
So that's what you do for a living.

01:44:15.440 --> 01:44:17.920
That's a just tell people you're overwhelmed.

01:44:17.920 --> 01:44:22.600
That's 15 minutes in the life of Levy.

01:44:22.600 --> 01:44:24.680
You do that on the weekends, too?

01:44:24.680 --> 01:44:25.960
On the, yeah.

01:44:25.960 --> 01:44:28.760
And that's just a tip of the iceberg.

01:44:28.760 --> 01:44:29.480
Yeah.

01:44:29.480 --> 01:44:33.680
Well, I work at fucking Staples.

01:44:33.680 --> 01:44:34.560
Tell me about it.

01:44:34.560 --> 01:44:37.560
So, from my perspective, it's called privilege.

01:44:37.560 --> 01:44:39.120
Yeah.

01:44:39.120 --> 01:44:40.800
Go finger.

01:44:40.800 --> 01:44:45.280
And if I get pregnant, I don't work at Staples anymore.

01:44:45.280 --> 01:44:48.000
And if I have a baby, I can't work at Staples

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:51.400
until the baby's old enough to work at Staples, in which case

01:44:51.400 --> 01:44:55.160
he'll get paid more than me.

01:44:55.160 --> 01:45:00.160
So, smallest violin.

01:45:00.160 --> 01:45:01.000
But I'm sorry.

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:05.080
I'm a combative young lady that's your age

01:45:05.080 --> 01:45:08.360
that I think would be good for you.

01:45:08.360 --> 01:45:10.760
Thank you.

01:45:10.760 --> 01:45:11.680
Do you?

01:45:11.680 --> 01:45:12.760
I love it.

01:45:12.760 --> 01:45:13.600
Do you?

01:45:13.600 --> 01:45:15.840
What do you think about no wrong answers,

01:45:15.840 --> 01:45:18.400
like the involvement of the butthole?

01:45:18.400 --> 01:45:26.200
Like, if I'm blowing you pinky, tickle the rim, no involvement?

01:45:26.200 --> 01:45:27.520
Answer carefully.

01:45:27.520 --> 01:45:34.320
Honestly, I've never tried it, but I've

01:45:34.320 --> 01:45:36.080
suggested it to other people.

01:45:39.080 --> 01:45:40.400
Good answer.

01:45:40.400 --> 01:45:43.800
It's a dangerous game.

01:45:43.800 --> 01:45:45.880
It's the most dangerous game.

01:45:49.440 --> 01:45:53.240
You're like the vampiric dot of butt play.

01:45:53.240 --> 01:45:55.560
It's also the plot of the ring three.

01:45:55.560 --> 01:45:59.560
Yeah.

01:45:59.560 --> 01:46:00.080
All right.

01:46:00.080 --> 01:46:02.120
It's almost worth interrupting to say,

01:46:02.120 --> 01:46:04.680
what do you mean you've suggested it to other people?

01:46:04.680 --> 01:46:06.680
What?

01:46:06.680 --> 01:46:09.240
Like, the people that you're a wist or a wist?

01:46:09.240 --> 01:46:10.960
No, I mean, it was about him, wasn't it?

01:46:10.960 --> 01:46:13.280
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

01:46:13.280 --> 01:46:16.200
You ever suggested this to people?

01:46:16.200 --> 01:46:21.280
Personally, I have no butthole experience.

01:46:21.280 --> 01:46:22.040
Let's see it.

01:46:22.040 --> 01:46:25.120
But it was, we changed that tonight, huh?

01:46:25.120 --> 01:46:26.640
How many people?

01:46:26.640 --> 01:46:29.520
Butthole experience.

01:46:29.520 --> 01:46:30.040
All right.

01:46:30.040 --> 01:46:34.280
Well, what have we learned over six years?

01:46:34.280 --> 01:46:37.680
Use the right pronouns.

01:46:37.680 --> 01:46:39.040
Trump will never get elected.

01:46:41.800 --> 01:46:50.360
Third parties, the way to go, we're evolving.

01:46:50.360 --> 01:46:53.920
TV's getting better and better.

01:46:53.920 --> 01:47:01.600
Jesus, Annie, happiness will win out in the end.

01:47:01.600 --> 01:47:06.240
A 10-day waiting period is more than enough for a gun.

01:47:06.240 --> 01:47:08.520
I still haven't picked mine up yet.

01:47:08.520 --> 01:47:12.000
But also, unfortunately, that applies to watching Atlanta

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:15.480
and Get Out, which I still haven't done.

01:47:15.480 --> 01:47:19.600
You tried getting out and going and buying tickets to shit

01:47:19.600 --> 01:47:22.800
when your knee hurts.

01:47:22.800 --> 01:47:27.480
You don't have to buy tickets to Atlanta, it's a TV show.

01:47:27.480 --> 01:47:30.360
You're going out and doing stuff because your apartment's

01:47:30.360 --> 01:47:33.200
hot, because you're poor.

01:47:33.200 --> 01:47:34.760
What's your over 40?

01:47:34.760 --> 01:47:36.320
You're going to want to hang out.

01:47:36.320 --> 01:47:41.200
Are you allowed to get a gun to see movies about black people?

01:47:41.200 --> 01:47:44.600
Oh, come on.

01:47:44.600 --> 01:47:48.440
I'm so glad there was not a mic on him for that.

01:47:48.440 --> 01:47:50.520
Anyways, well, here's where we were born.

01:47:50.520 --> 01:47:53.320
Here's not where we're dying, but Harmontown

01:47:53.320 --> 01:47:57.640
is moving out from its parents' basement.

01:47:57.640 --> 01:47:59.240
But we're taking you with us.

01:48:02.600 --> 01:48:05.600
Under your seat is a glass of Kool-Aid and a tablet.

01:48:08.600 --> 01:48:14.200
We're moving into our beating curtain attic with Jan.

01:48:14.200 --> 01:48:19.960
And we're going to learn what speakers actually cost.

01:48:19.960 --> 01:48:23.600
And all the other things that happen in your 20s,

01:48:23.600 --> 01:48:25.440
which in podcast years, Harmontown

01:48:25.440 --> 01:48:27.400
is interested in its mid-20s.

01:48:27.400 --> 01:48:28.680
We're leveling up.

01:48:28.680 --> 01:48:30.040
The show's only going to get better.

01:48:30.040 --> 01:48:33.280
Justin's wearing white now.

01:48:33.280 --> 01:48:36.680
We got two Leaves.

01:48:36.680 --> 01:48:40.040
One's made of straw.

01:48:40.040 --> 01:48:43.760
It's just a Leaves-shaped scarecrow.

01:48:43.760 --> 01:48:46.920
And then he's going to wear a suit the entire time,

01:48:46.920 --> 01:48:48.840
and I'm going to wear lumberjack shirts and shorts.

01:48:48.840 --> 01:48:51.320
Oh, yeah.

01:48:51.320 --> 01:48:52.680
That's a, oh, yeah.

01:48:52.680 --> 01:48:54.800
But we're going to renew, probably,

01:48:54.800 --> 01:48:56.960
let's get to the moon when we go to the place.

01:48:56.960 --> 01:48:58.080
But we'll have a good show.

01:48:58.080 --> 01:49:00.120
But we've got to get out of here because we're giving up

01:49:00.120 --> 01:49:02.320
because we do believe that people are stupid.

01:49:02.320 --> 01:49:04.760
But we're going to continue to care about them and love them.

01:49:04.760 --> 01:49:05.960
But we know that they're stupid.

01:49:05.960 --> 01:49:07.400
We just don't expect any more of them.

01:49:07.400 --> 01:49:09.880
The planet's going to be eaten alive by dumb people.

01:49:09.880 --> 01:49:12.080
You know, Dan, we only have a couple minutes left.

01:49:12.080 --> 01:49:14.400
Why don't we just wrap it out in good fashion?

01:49:14.400 --> 01:49:17.080
Our last rap on this stage.

01:49:17.080 --> 01:49:20.320
Yeah.

01:49:20.320 --> 01:49:21.640
Oh, thanks, John Carmen.

01:49:21.640 --> 01:49:22.760
Thanks, John Carmen.

01:49:22.760 --> 01:49:24.480
John Carmen, everybody.

01:49:24.480 --> 01:49:25.560
Here we go.

01:49:25.560 --> 01:49:26.880
Thanks for coming, Mitch.

01:49:26.880 --> 01:49:27.360
Thanks for it.

01:49:27.360 --> 01:49:28.400
Thank you.

01:49:28.400 --> 01:49:29.920
Thanks for having me.

01:49:29.920 --> 01:49:31.840
Feel free to jump in on this rap if you want.

01:49:31.840 --> 01:49:33.600
Oh, no, I'm not going to do it all.

01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:34.480
I don't feel free to do it.

01:49:34.480 --> 01:49:35.400
All right, everybody.

01:49:35.400 --> 01:49:38.480
Give it up for your mayor, Dan Armin.

01:49:38.480 --> 01:49:38.960
Oh!

01:49:42.320 --> 01:49:43.000
You got it, Armin.

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:43.720
Let's go.

01:49:43.720 --> 01:49:45.960
Final rap on the meltdown stage.

01:49:45.960 --> 01:49:47.720
Only you can fucking do this.

01:49:47.720 --> 01:49:50.880
No, I think this whole rap has to be Mitch Hurwitz only.

01:49:50.880 --> 01:49:52.640
I think it has to be Mitch.

01:49:52.640 --> 01:49:56.800
You know, I don't know a lot about the Founding Fathers,

01:49:56.800 --> 01:49:58.120
so my rap isn't great.

01:49:58.120 --> 01:50:00.120
Oh!

01:50:00.120 --> 01:50:01.480
You know, that bitch is crazy.

01:50:01.480 --> 01:50:02.320
It was Ben Franklin.

01:50:02.320 --> 01:50:02.960
I know that.

01:50:02.960 --> 01:50:05.920
I don't know how to rap.

01:50:05.920 --> 01:50:06.920
Rap!

01:50:06.920 --> 01:50:08.920
I'll do some rap.

01:50:08.920 --> 01:50:10.920
It's a rap.

01:50:10.920 --> 01:50:11.920
Rap!

01:50:11.920 --> 01:50:13.640
I don't know what it is.

01:50:13.640 --> 01:50:14.600
Rap.

01:50:14.600 --> 01:50:15.840
It's a game you play.

01:50:15.840 --> 01:50:17.080
With your mouth.

01:50:17.080 --> 01:50:19.640
At the end of the day, you just move your lips.

01:50:19.640 --> 01:50:21.120
And the words come out.

01:50:21.120 --> 01:50:23.440
Teeth go up, and your lips go south.

01:50:23.440 --> 01:50:26.120
You got to say what you're on your mind.

01:50:26.120 --> 01:50:29.560
Then you say what you can find in your soul.

01:50:29.560 --> 01:50:32.080
When you look down deep, I fucked your mama so hard,

01:50:32.080 --> 01:50:33.560
she turned into a sheep.

01:50:33.560 --> 01:50:34.800
Oh.

01:50:34.800 --> 01:50:37.320
And then she counted herself going up and down

01:50:37.320 --> 01:50:38.480
up to the upper shelf.

01:50:38.480 --> 01:50:39.720
I got her pussy up high.

01:50:39.720 --> 01:50:41.040
I got her pussy down low.

01:50:41.040 --> 01:50:42.400
I got her pussy in the middle.

01:50:42.400 --> 01:50:43.520
And away we go.

01:50:43.520 --> 01:50:46.440
Yo, Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan.

01:50:46.440 --> 01:50:49.000
How many mamas do you think you fucked so far?

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:50.800
5,000.

01:50:50.800 --> 01:50:53.160
Mother fucker.

01:50:53.160 --> 01:50:54.120
Round number.

01:50:56.840 --> 01:50:57.640
Thanks for asking.

01:51:00.640 --> 01:51:02.640
I'll tell you about every single one of them.

01:51:02.640 --> 01:51:04.120
Oh.

01:51:04.120 --> 01:51:05.280
Mother number one.

01:51:05.280 --> 01:51:06.600
I fucked to the son.

01:51:06.600 --> 01:51:07.760
Mother number two.

01:51:07.760 --> 01:51:09.120
I fucked with some goo.

01:51:09.120 --> 01:51:10.320
Mother number three.

01:51:10.320 --> 01:51:11.400
I fucked it instead of peeing.

01:51:11.400 --> 01:51:12.560
And so no mother number four.

01:51:12.560 --> 01:51:14.280
I made my penis kind of sore.

01:51:14.280 --> 01:51:15.320
Mother number five.

01:51:15.320 --> 01:51:16.800
I brought my dick back alive.

01:51:16.800 --> 01:51:17.960
Mother number six.

01:51:17.960 --> 01:51:19.000
I fucked with some sticks.

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:20.440
It was gross.

01:51:20.440 --> 01:51:21.480
But she asked for it.

01:51:21.480 --> 01:51:22.800
It was consensual.

01:51:22.800 --> 01:51:25.680
And that's all I'm going to say about it.

01:51:25.680 --> 01:51:27.400
Mother number seven.

01:51:27.400 --> 01:51:29.120
The only thing that's going to rhyme is heaven.

01:51:29.120 --> 01:51:30.280
You already know that.

01:51:30.280 --> 01:51:31.920
So that's where I fucked her.

01:51:31.920 --> 01:51:33.160
Mother number eight.

01:51:33.160 --> 01:51:33.920
Who knows?

01:51:33.920 --> 01:51:34.560
Wait.

01:51:34.560 --> 01:51:35.800
Oh.

01:51:35.800 --> 01:51:37.280
Mother number nine.

01:51:37.280 --> 01:51:38.000
Whoa.

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:39.280
That mother was fine.

01:51:39.280 --> 01:51:40.480
She was so fine.

01:51:40.480 --> 01:51:41.760
I never fucked her again.

01:51:41.760 --> 01:51:45.560
But then you long came mother 10.

01:51:45.560 --> 01:51:49.700
Mother 11 was a lot like mother seven.

01:51:49.700 --> 01:51:51.520
Mother number 12 into what I won't

01:51:51.520 --> 01:51:56.080
dwell because privacy was her main thing.

01:51:56.080 --> 01:51:59.080
Along with lack of rhyming.

01:51:59.080 --> 01:52:00.600
Mother number 13.

01:52:00.600 --> 01:52:01.600
Was it Jelly Bean?

01:52:01.600 --> 01:52:03.420
I'm going to fucking to fucking to fucking

01:52:03.420 --> 01:52:07.080
to fuck on another fucking piece.

01:52:07.080 --> 01:52:08.440
That's not don't applaud that.

01:52:08.440 --> 01:52:09.160
Don't applaud that.

01:52:09.160 --> 01:52:11.200
That's not.

01:52:11.200 --> 01:52:13.900
mother 14 and then there's a bunch of mothers that would only rhyme with

01:52:13.900 --> 01:52:16.100
We have 4,989 to go

01:52:16.100 --> 01:52:20.500
Mother 4,900 wasn't so good and my dick got all scrundled

01:52:20.500 --> 01:52:27.200
I made up words because by that time I was ready to fuck birds and I fucked your mama's till I could fly

01:52:27.200 --> 01:52:32.200
I put some wings on my dick and went up so high went up to heaven said hi to mother number seven

01:52:32.200 --> 01:52:36.200
and came down and fucked mother again

01:52:36.200 --> 01:52:40.200
but here's what I learned from fucking all those mothers

01:52:40.200 --> 01:52:43.200
there's no other like a mother

01:52:43.200 --> 01:52:48.200
you can't even fuck a brother and have it be as good as a mother

01:52:48.200 --> 01:52:51.200
but that's not a homophobic statement

01:52:51.200 --> 01:52:55.200
because if you're gay then your brother can be a mother

01:52:55.200 --> 01:52:59.200
but that's not saying gay people are incestuous

01:52:59.200 --> 01:53:02.200
I should probably get out of this area

01:53:02.200 --> 01:53:10.200
one of the things we learned at this space is that there takes a lot of people to make a human race

01:53:10.200 --> 01:53:15.200
there's people that are born one way and say hey I'm gonna be another way

01:53:15.200 --> 01:53:18.200
and why would you bother to say hey why are you gonna be that way

01:53:18.200 --> 01:53:22.200
that doesn't make any sense there's a lot of better ways to spend your energy

01:53:22.200 --> 01:53:26.200
and if you're lazy you're actually progressive because you're like who gives a shit

01:53:26.200 --> 01:53:28.200
and a lot of people are like thank you

01:53:28.200 --> 01:53:32.200
it's when we care that we really end up fucking everything up

01:53:32.200 --> 01:53:35.200
especially when we care about ourselves

01:53:35.200 --> 01:53:38.200
you should always thank you ma'am

01:53:38.200 --> 01:53:42.200
not to call you ma'am you can be anything you want

01:53:42.200 --> 01:53:45.200
that's what we learned the most

01:53:45.200 --> 01:53:48.200
six years go by like a flash of the pan

01:53:48.200 --> 01:53:51.200
I fucked your mama till my name was Dan

01:53:51.200 --> 01:53:53.200
I fucked your mama all over the land

01:53:53.200 --> 01:53:56.200
I fucked it from the horizon to the frying pan

01:53:56.200 --> 01:53:58.200
and we went I put a piece of butter on it

01:53:58.200 --> 01:54:00.200
okay alright

01:54:00.200 --> 01:54:02.200
oh shit

01:54:05.200 --> 01:54:07.200
