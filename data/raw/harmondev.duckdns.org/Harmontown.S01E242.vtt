you.\n\n01:10.580 --> 01:11.580\nThank you.\n\n01:11.580 --> 01:12.580\nWow.\n\n01:12.580 --> 01:13.580\nWhat a welcome.\n\n01:13.580 --> 01:14.580\nAnd thank you and goodbye.\n\n01:14.580 --> 01:15.580\nGoodbye.\n\n01:15.580 --> 01:16.580\nRight?\n\n01:16.580 --> 01:17.580\nGoodbye.\n\n01:17.580 --> 01:18.580\nLet's do a show first.\n\n01:18.580 --> 01:22.580\nWe're doing one last show here at Meltdown, which has been our...\n\n01:22.580 --> 01:27.580\nRob Schwab!\n\n01:27.580 --> 01:30.580\nWhat?!\n\n01:30.580 --> 01:37.580\nYeah!\n\n01:37.580 --> 01:41.580\nRob, an unheralded Rob Schwab.\n\n01:41.580 --> 01:46.580\nHe's rolling up his shirt sleeves like Roddy Piper is...\n\n01:46.580 --> 01:49.580\nPulling a spring steam!\n\n01:49.580 --> 01:52.580\nHe's doing a Popeye dance.\n\n01:52.580 --> 01:54.580\nHello, Rob.\n\n01:54.580 --> 01:57.580\nHello, Daniel.\n\n01:57.580 --> 02:00.580\nAnyways, this was our birthplace in our home for five years.\n\n02:00.580 --> 02:01.580\nSix years?\n\n02:01.580 --> 02:08.580\nIt says 2011 on what Camille pointed out was a shitty flag last week.\n\n02:08.580 --> 02:11.580\nSo six years, really.\n\n02:11.580 --> 02:12.580\nSomehow.\n\n02:12.580 --> 02:13.580\nIt feels like 11.\n\n02:13.580 --> 02:14.580\nI'm not joking.\n\n02:14.580 --> 02:15.580\nIt feels like...\n\n02:15.580 --> 02:22.580\nSteve, never touch me.\n\n02:22.580 --> 02:26.580\nWe spoke about this before the show, Steve.\n\n02:26.580 --> 02:27.580\nDon't touch...\n\n02:27.580 --> 02:28.580\nOh, you...\n\n02:28.580 --> 02:32.580\nI can't hit you, Levy.\n\n02:32.580 --> 02:35.580\nYou just said not to do that.\n\n02:35.580 --> 02:36.580\nI know.\n\n02:36.580 --> 02:37.580\nThen you did it.\n\n02:37.580 --> 02:38.580\nYou did it.\n\n02:38.580 --> 02:39.580\nI know.\n\n02:39.580 --> 02:43.580\nWe have a weird role-playing thing where I tell him one thing and he hugs me.\n\n02:43.580 --> 02:44.580\nAll right, so...\n\n02:44.580 --> 02:50.580\nOh, I thought very much, fucking nice bucket.\n\n02:50.580 --> 02:52.580\nHe's just dancing.\n\n02:52.580 --> 02:57.580\nOh, shit.\n\n02:57.580 --> 02:59.580\nThis shows...\n\n02:59.580 --> 03:05.580\nYou guys know that this isn't mostly an audio podcast, right?\n\n03:05.580 --> 03:11.580\nWe've been here for six years, Steve.\n\n03:11.580 --> 03:21.580\nIt's like the opening credits of Good Times over there.\n\n03:21.580 --> 03:31.580\nSo I tried to watch...\n\n03:31.580 --> 03:32.580\nI started...\n\n03:32.580 --> 03:36.580\nI watched the ring, too, tonight.\n\n03:36.580 --> 03:39.580\nOnly because I wanted to watch rings.\n\n03:39.580 --> 03:41.580\nAnd I didn't want to...\n\n03:41.580 --> 03:44.580\nIt seemed stupid, but I was like, yeah, I didn't want to...\n\n03:44.580 --> 03:45.580\nI was like, what did I forget?\n\n03:45.580 --> 03:47.580\nI almost wanted to watch the last 20 minutes of the ring,\n\n03:47.580 --> 03:50.580\nbut instead I read the Wikipedia entry for the ring.\n\n03:50.580 --> 03:52.580\nIt was still confusing.\n\n03:52.580 --> 03:54.580\nIs there actually a ring?\n\n03:54.580 --> 03:56.580\nThey call it the ring.\n\n03:56.580 --> 03:58.580\nIs there only one ring?\n\n03:58.580 --> 04:01.580\nIs there a ring in the movie?\n\n04:01.580 --> 04:02.580\nNo, there's...\n\n04:02.580 --> 04:04.580\nIsn't it a tape?\n\n04:04.580 --> 04:05.580\nYeah.\n\n04:05.580 --> 04:07.580\nYou're talking about Lord of the Rings.\n\n04:07.580 --> 04:09.580\nI was referencing that.\n\n04:09.580 --> 04:12.580\nThe ring is a ring of light that turns out to be...\n\n04:12.580 --> 04:15.580\nAt the end of the first movie,\n\n04:15.580 --> 04:18.580\nturns out to be the view from the bottom of a well.\n\n04:18.580 --> 04:20.580\nThat's important because it's one of those horror movies\n\n04:20.580 --> 04:22.580\nwhere you spend 90 minutes going,\n\n04:22.580 --> 04:24.580\nooh, creepy.\n\n04:24.580 --> 04:26.580\nMostly creepy because, ooh, why?\n\n04:26.580 --> 04:27.580\nWhat's going on?\n\n04:27.580 --> 04:28.580\nWhy a lighthouse?\n\n04:28.580 --> 04:30.580\nWhy a horse?\n\n04:30.580 --> 04:32.580\nAnd then someone, inevitably in those movies,\n\n04:32.580 --> 04:34.580\nit's all fine and dandy.\n\n04:34.580 --> 04:36.580\nWhen it's like buying on credit, you go,\n\n04:36.580 --> 04:39.580\nokay, and she was a psychic girl\n\n04:39.580 --> 04:41.580\nthat lived under a lighthouse and killed horses.\n\n04:41.580 --> 04:44.580\nOkay, the whole crazy movie makes sense.\n\n04:44.580 --> 04:46.580\nIt's a ring of light from a well.\n\n04:46.580 --> 04:48.580\nEnd of movie.\n\n04:48.580 --> 04:49.580\nGo home.\n\n04:49.580 --> 04:50.580\nThat was fun.\n\n04:50.580 --> 04:52.580\nI liked how she crawled.\n\n04:52.580 --> 04:54.580\n$450 million.\n\n04:54.580 --> 04:56.580\nIt cost $30 million to make or whatever.\n\n04:56.580 --> 04:58.580\nSo guess what?\n\n04:58.580 --> 05:01.580\nDo you think anybody working on the second ring movie?\n\n05:01.580 --> 05:02.580\nAnybody.\n\n05:02.580 --> 05:03.580\nI don't care.\n\n05:03.580 --> 05:04.580\nKaterer.\n\n05:04.580 --> 05:05.580\nAnybody.\n\n05:05.580 --> 05:07.580\nDo you think anybody was, like,\n\n05:07.580 --> 05:09.580\nseriously plus this is going to be, like,\n\n05:09.580 --> 05:12.580\nthe better of the two ring movies?\n\n05:12.580 --> 05:14.580\nBecause we're...\n\n05:14.580 --> 05:17.580\nI spent the whole time watching the ring, too,\n\n05:17.580 --> 05:20.580\nsaying to Cody, like, you know, this is awful.\n\n05:20.580 --> 05:22.580\nLike, this isn't even bad for a ring sequel.\n\n05:22.580 --> 05:24.580\nLike, I thought it would be bad,\n\n05:24.580 --> 05:26.580\nbut I thought it would be fun bad, like,\n\n05:26.580 --> 05:28.580\nthe relationship between sequels should be kind of like,\n\n05:28.580 --> 05:30.580\noh, the first movie's called, like,\n\n05:30.580 --> 05:33.580\nTap Dancing Cat, and then the sequel should be, like...\n\n05:33.580 --> 05:35.580\nDid you think, like, you think, like,\n\n05:35.580 --> 05:37.580\nthe tape, there was going to be more tapes?\n\n05:37.580 --> 05:38.580\nYeah.\n\n05:38.580 --> 05:41.580\nLike Hellraiser 3, they all would have been coming down the street,\n\n05:41.580 --> 05:43.580\nlike, coming after you, like, the tapes?\n\n05:43.580 --> 05:45.580\nI thought they would do stuff, like,\n\n05:45.580 --> 05:47.580\nyeah, they would dig in a little bit.\n\n05:47.580 --> 05:50.580\nLike, the protagonist would work at a VCR repair shop.\n\n05:50.580 --> 05:51.580\nRight.\n\n05:51.580 --> 05:52.580\nLike, there are things.\n\n05:52.580 --> 05:55.580\nSo, it turns out, that's the third one.\n\n05:55.580 --> 05:57.580\nStill a bad idea.\n\n05:57.580 --> 05:58.580\nYeah.\n\n05:58.580 --> 06:01.580\nLike, I wrote Rings 3 while I was watching Rings 2,\n\n06:01.580 --> 06:03.580\nand Rings 3 is still bad.\n\n06:03.580 --> 06:05.580\nLike, if I had written it, still bad.\n\n06:05.580 --> 06:07.580\nDid you ever see The Grudge?\n\n06:07.580 --> 06:10.580\nI never saw The Grudge, because I figured it was the same.\n\n06:10.580 --> 06:13.580\nI'm not, you know, it's like, it would be like,\n\n06:13.580 --> 06:15.580\nNightmare on Elm Street, and then doing, like,\n\n06:15.580 --> 06:16.580\nWeekend at Freddy's.\n\n06:16.580 --> 06:19.580\nWell, The Grudge is, there's,\n\n06:19.580 --> 06:21.580\ncorrect me if I'm wrong, like, there's, like,\n\n06:21.580 --> 06:23.580\nan apartment that there was a murder in,\n\n06:23.580 --> 06:25.580\nor a home that was a murder in.\n\n06:25.580 --> 06:27.580\nA murder of a girl that looks through her bangs.\n\n06:27.580 --> 06:28.580\nRight.\n\n06:28.580 --> 06:29.580\nAnd...\n\n06:29.580 --> 06:30.580\nAnd who drifts.\n\n06:30.580 --> 06:33.580\nAnd anybody that goes to that apartment,\n\n06:33.580 --> 06:35.580\ngets cursed, and then...\n\n06:35.580 --> 06:38.580\nSo killed that their face is scary.\n\n06:38.580 --> 06:39.580\nYeah.\n\n06:39.580 --> 06:41.580\nThere's a through line of all the movies.\n\n06:41.580 --> 06:44.580\nThere's ring movies that don't have videotape in them,\n\n06:44.580 --> 06:47.580\nbut they all, somebody thought that the through line was,\n\n06:47.580 --> 06:49.580\nwas the scary face that,\n\n06:49.580 --> 06:51.580\nwhat Cody and I were calling the EFF,\n\n06:51.580 --> 06:53.580\nthe extreme fear face.\n\n06:53.580 --> 06:55.580\nWhat's her name?\n\n06:55.580 --> 06:56.580\nNan Tuckett?\n\n06:56.580 --> 06:57.580\nAshley Judd?\n\n06:57.580 --> 06:58.580\nWhat's her name?\n\n06:58.580 --> 06:59.580\nWinona Judd?\n\n06:59.580 --> 07:01.580\nJudd Ryder?\n\n07:01.580 --> 07:03.580\nNaomi Watkins?\n\n07:03.580 --> 07:05.580\nShe goes into an ambulance.\n\n07:05.580 --> 07:07.580\nJudd Reinhold.\n\n07:07.580 --> 07:09.580\nShe recorded the tape,\n\n07:09.580 --> 07:11.580\nso that she could save her kid's life,\n\n07:11.580 --> 07:13.580\nand she, like, gives, ostensibly,\n\n07:13.580 --> 07:15.580\nbetween the two movies, something they never address.\n\n07:15.580 --> 07:17.580\nShe must have grabbed a drifter,\n\n07:17.580 --> 07:19.580\nor a cancer patient, or a prisoner,\n\n07:19.580 --> 07:21.580\nand said, hey, watch this.\n\n07:21.580 --> 07:22.580\nBye!\n\n07:22.580 --> 07:25.580\nAnd thereby saving the life of her child, Aiden,\n\n07:25.580 --> 07:27.580\nwhich she pronounces with a Schrodinger's H.\n\n07:27.580 --> 07:28.580\nHey, Aiden.\n\n07:28.580 --> 07:30.580\nHey, is it Hayden?\n\n07:30.580 --> 07:31.580\nI turned down the subtitles.\n\n07:31.580 --> 07:32.580\nIt's Aiden.\n\n07:32.580 --> 07:33.580\nWhy doesn't...\n\n07:33.580 --> 07:34.580\nI mean, it's all the actress.\n\n07:34.580 --> 07:36.580\nYou turned down the subtitles to find that out?\n\n07:36.580 --> 07:39.580\nAnyways, yes, I did.\n\n07:39.580 --> 07:40.580\nYou gotta turn them up.\n\n07:40.580 --> 07:42.580\nYou gotta turn those subtitles up\n\n07:42.580 --> 07:43.580\nso you can hear that H.\n\n07:43.580 --> 07:45.580\nI like to keep them at, kind of, a medium level.\n\n07:45.580 --> 07:47.580\nI like the subtitles to be, kind of,\n\n07:47.580 --> 07:49.580\nlike, 50% percent.\n\n07:49.580 --> 07:51.580\nSo, but anyway,\n\n07:51.580 --> 07:53.580\ndid you know that they had,\n\n07:53.580 --> 07:56.580\nthey had grudge versus the ring?\n\n07:56.580 --> 07:57.580\nGrudge versus the ring?\n\n07:57.580 --> 07:59.580\nYeah, somebody takes the videotape\n\n07:59.580 --> 08:01.580\nto the grudge apartment\n\n08:01.580 --> 08:03.580\nand plays the videotape in there.\n\n08:03.580 --> 08:05.580\nWait, is this at the end of the grudge?\n\n08:05.580 --> 08:07.580\nOr is this, like, a different movie?\n\n08:07.580 --> 08:08.580\nIs it a different movie?\n\n08:08.580 --> 08:09.580\nLike, grudge versus ring?\n\n08:09.580 --> 08:10.580\nRequiem?\n\n08:10.580 --> 08:11.580\nYeah, like, it just happened,\n\n08:11.580 --> 08:13.580\nit just happened, like, last year.\n\n08:13.580 --> 08:16.580\nThey actually had the girl from the ring,\n\n08:16.580 --> 08:18.580\nlike, throw out the first pitch\n\n08:18.580 --> 08:20.580\nat a baseball game.\n\n08:20.580 --> 08:22.580\nLike, she's like, oh, like this?\n\n08:22.580 --> 08:24.580\nAnd she's like, throw this out?\n\n08:24.580 --> 08:26.580\nYou can find it online.\n\n08:26.580 --> 08:28.580\nBut we should watch that\n\n08:28.580 --> 08:29.580\nat our next Hangout,\n\n08:29.580 --> 08:31.580\ngrudge versus ring.\n\n08:31.580 --> 08:34.580\nYou know, I can't tell which part is a bit.\n\n08:34.580 --> 08:36.580\nLike, I don't know what...\n\n08:36.580 --> 08:38.580\nDid they do a grudge versus ring at all?\n\n08:38.580 --> 08:40.580\nThe part where you come to the Hangout.\n\n08:40.580 --> 08:41.580\nYeah.\n\n08:41.580 --> 08:43.580\nThat's the bit.\n\n08:43.580 --> 08:44.580\nYeah!\n\n08:44.580 --> 08:45.580\nOh!\n\n08:45.580 --> 08:47.580\nOh,

Big Bang Theory.\n\n09:07.580 --> 09:09.580\nThe guy that's not the guy.\n\n09:09.580 --> 09:10.580\nFrancis Bang?\n\n09:10.580 --> 09:11.580\nYeah.\n\n09:16.580 --> 09:20.580\nIs one of the characters named Bang?\n\n09:20.580 --> 09:22.580\nAlright, I'm looking at this.\n\n09:22.580 --> 09:24.580\nHi, I'm gonna be big one day,\n\n09:24.580 --> 09:26.580\nand this is my theory.\n\n09:26.580 --> 09:28.580\nI was trying...\n\n09:28.580 --> 09:31.580\nYou guys all drive the same way over here, right?\n\n09:31.580 --> 09:33.580\nDid you pass a building today\n\n09:33.580 --> 09:36.580\nwith a giant LED sign on it?\n\n09:36.580 --> 09:39.580\nOne of those standard red LED displays\n\n09:39.580 --> 09:41.580\nthat just says Frank Stallone?\n\n09:41.580 -->

I mean, I think\n\n25:15.580 --> 25:17.580\nthere's all sorts of proof that\n\n25:17.580 --> 25:19.580\nyou can show, you can\n\n25:19.580 --> 25:21.580\ngive people reasonable evidence and there's\n\n25:21.580 --> 25:23.580\nall these studies that show, no, they just believe\n\n25:23.580 --> 25:25.580\nwhat they believe is stronger.\n\n25:25.580 --> 25:27.580\nWhich, as a chimpanzee,\n\n25:27.580 --> 25:29.580\nlike, that's kind of admirable.\n\n25:29.580 --> 25:31.580\nLike, that we have this skepticism,\n\n25:31.580 --> 25:33.580\nbut it's like, it's a gauge that it's like\n\n25:33.580 --> 25:35.580\nif you could just put it on pause\n\n25:35.580 --> 25:37.580\nand shit that matters. We have to be willing to,\n\n25:37.580 --> 25:39.580\nyou know, I don't know, I don't know that I would\n\n25:39.580 --> 25:41.580\npass this test. You have to be willing\n\n25:41.580 --> 25:43.580\nto be able to be convinced of another.\n\n25:43.580 --> 25:45.580\nLike, if somebody said to me, could\n\n25:45.580 --> 25:47.580\nI convince you that\n\n25:47.580 --> 25:49.580\none race or one sex\n\n25:49.580 --> 25:51.580\nis better than another, I might\n\n25:51.580 --> 25:53.580\nsay no. I mean, I might have that\n\n25:53.580 --> 25:55.580\nliberal knee jerk, and\n\n25:55.580 --> 25:57.580\nsomebody who believes, you know, that the\n\n25:57.580 --> 25:59.580\nearth is 5,000 years old may also\n\n25:59.580 --> 26:01.580\nsay no. Right. You know, they may say\n\n26:01.580 --> 26:03.580\nno, I can't be convinced. Well, how many times\n\n26:03.580 --> 26:05.580\nwe all know we have that built-in hero gene\n\n26:05.580 --> 26:07.580\nthat's like, oh, you're supposed\n\n26:07.580 --> 26:09.580\nto be adamant. You're supposed to stick\n\n26:09.580 --> 26:11.580\nto your convictions. Yeah, you're supposed\n\n26:11.580 --> 26:13.580\nto cross thresholds and explore, but often those things\n\n26:13.580 --> 26:15.580\nare foisted upon you, and you're supposed to,\n\n26:15.580 --> 26:17.580\nbut what you're really supposed to do is defend\n\n26:17.580 --> 26:19.580\nthe honor of your integrity and all this\n\n26:19.580 --> 26:21.580\nshit, and you're, it really is\n\n26:21.580 --> 26:23.580\njust an emotional reaction. If somebody says\n\n26:23.580 --> 26:25.580\neverything you believe is a lie,\n\n26:25.580 --> 26:27.580\nyou're kind of, it's not, we don't\n\n26:27.580 --> 26:29.580\ncall it an admirable characteristic. You go like,\n\n26:29.580 --> 26:31.580\nokay, don't boss. Like, we\n\n26:31.580 --> 26:33.580\nlook at with admiration\n\n26:33.580 --> 26:35.580\nupon the hero that goes like,\n\n26:35.580 --> 26:37.580\nwell, I'm a Sunni.\n\n26:37.580 --> 26:39.580\nI'm not a Shia.\n\n26:39.580 --> 26:41.580\nAnd I will never be a Shia.\n\n26:41.580 --> 26:43.580\nIt's like, you know, I mean,\n\n26:43.580 --> 26:45.580\nit really is. It's like,\n\n26:45.580 --> 26:47.580\nwe all have these tribal things that even\n\n26:47.580 --> 26:49.580\nhaving children, I\n\n26:49.580 --> 26:51.580\nhave found myself saying things about\n\n26:51.580 --> 26:53.580\nlike, oh, come on,\n\n26:53.580 --> 26:55.580\nyou know, buck up. I didn't\n\n26:55.580 --> 26:57.580\nmean to, don't tell your mother. I didn't\n\n26:57.580 --> 26:59.580\nmean to break your lip or whatever the\n\n26:59.580 --> 27:01.580\nspecific doesn't matter, but\n\n27:01.580 --> 27:03.580\nthat seems very\n\n27:03.580 --> 27:05.580\nspecific.\n\n27:05.580 --> 27:07.580\nBut, no, but\n\n27:07.580 --> 27:09.580\nI mean, I've even found that I've wanted to say\n\n27:09.580 --> 27:11.580\nthings like, well, you're a herwitzer. Just give them\n\n27:11.580 --> 27:13.580\nthis little sense of identity that they have.\n\n27:13.580 --> 27:15.580\nAnd then as I do that, I think, well, that's what's wrong\n\n27:15.580 --> 27:17.580\nwith the whole world.\n\n27:17.580 --> 27:19.580\nBut you can't really tell a child that you're no\n\n27:19.580 --> 27:21.580\nbetter than it. You should cry\n\n27:21.580 --> 27:23.580\nbecause you're\n\n27:23.580 --> 27:25.580\nnot special. I mean, how many times a\n\n27:25.580 --> 27:27.580\nday or a week at least,\n\n27:27.580 --> 27:29.580\nyou're in a conversation with somebody that's\n\n27:29.580 --> 27:31.580\ncollaborating creatively and then somebody starts\n\n27:31.580 --> 27:33.580\nto go, you know, here's the thing\n\n27:33.580 --> 27:35.580\nthough, like if, you know, people love\n\n27:35.580 --> 27:37.580\ndogs and you're just like, you're\n\n27:37.580 --> 27:39.580\na better showrunner, for instance, if you\n\n27:39.580 --> 27:41.580\ngo like, I know where you're going with that, please shut the\n\n27:41.580 --> 27:43.580\nfuck up. My writers can handle it. I'm not adding\n\n27:43.580 --> 27:45.580\na dog to the show because you watched\n\n27:45.580 --> 27:47.580\nFrasier.\n\n27:47.580 --> 27:49.580\nIs that what they did on that show? No.\n\n27:49.580 --> 27:51.580\nI'm behind. I haven't. I'm just saying like\n\n27:51.580 --> 27:53.580\nSpoiler. There's a dog.\n\n27:53.580 --> 27:55.580\nYou don't call that\n\n27:55.580 --> 27:57.580\nbigotry against someone else's ideas,\n\n27:57.580 --> 27:59.580\nbut you're using the same\n\n27:59.580 --> 28:01.580\nreflexive, kind of almost ignorant,\n\n28:01.580 --> 28:03.580\nkind of like barbaric part of your brain\n\n28:03.580 --> 28:05.580\nthat defends your turds\n\n28:05.580 --> 28:07.580\nand piss and eggs, all of which\n\n28:07.580 --> 28:09.580\nare equal about you're like, that's where I poop, shit.\n\n28:09.580 --> 28:11.580\nGotta defend that. Gotta defend that.\n\n28:11.580 --> 28:13.580\nPeople are always coming after it. Things that\n\n28:13.580 --> 28:15.580\nyou secrete, you're like\n\n28:15.580 --> 28:17.580\nyou're like sensitive about. You're like\n\n28:17.580 --> 28:19.580\nI'm pooping and if somebody's\n\n28:19.580 --> 28:21.580\nlike, knock, knock, you're like, fuck off\n\n28:21.580 --> 28:23.580\nand that's what you're supposed to do. That's my poop and piss.\n\n28:23.580 --> 28:25.580\nYou're not supposed to say, get in here, put\n\n28:25.580 --> 28:27.580\nyour finger in there and help that turd come out\n\n28:27.580 --> 28:29.580\nor put new turds up there.\n\n28:29.580 --> 28:31.580\nMine are just as good as yours.\n\n28:31.580 --> 28:33.580\nKeep away from my turds.\n\n28:33.580 --> 28:35.580\nI really want to\n\n28:35.580 --> 28:37.580\nI want to agree with that.\n\n28:37.580 --> 28:39.580\nI'm just\n\n28:39.580 --> 28:41.580\nBut you're going to\n\n28:41.580 --> 28:43.580\nkind of work on my way back to where it started\n\n28:43.580 --> 28:45.580\nand I don't know what side I'm on there.\n\n28:45.580 --> 28:47.580\nYou can have my turds.\n\n28:47.580 --> 28:49.580\nI think I'm okay with it.

You know what I\n\n28:53.580 --> 28:55.580\nbrought up in a writer's room recently\n\n28:55.580 --> 28:57.580\nand was instantly shot down\n\n28:57.580 --> 28:59.580\nso I think I'm on to something.\n\n28:59.580 --> 29:01.580\nYou know\n\n29:01.580 --> 29:03.580\n6 billion is a high number.\n\n29:03.580 --> 29:05.580\nI remember\n\n29:05.580 --> 29:07.580\nfor a baker per year, yes.\n\n29:07.580 --> 29:09.580\nSo last show everybody, things are coming.\n\n29:09.580 --> 29:11.580\nHow much does a baker make?\n\n29:11.580 --> 29:13.580\nThat was always our test\n\n29:13.580 --> 29:15.580\nof the rich people in the room. How much do you think\n\n29:15.580 --> 29:17.580\na baker makes? 200,000 a year? 500?\n\n29:17.580 --> 29:19.580\nWhat's your guess?\n\n29:19.580 --> 29:21.580\nWhat does a toaster cost?\n\n29:21.580 --> 29:23.580\n$500? What do you think?\n\n29:23.580 --> 29:25.580\n$450?\n\n29:25.580 --> 29:27.580\nYou know\n\n29:27.580 --> 29:29.580\nhaving grown up watching things like\n\n29:29.580 --> 29:31.580\nall the president's men and you see like\n\n29:31.580 --> 29:33.580\nyou know, we know it's Nixon\n\n29:33.580 --> 29:35.580\nbut you're watching these guys sort of\n\n29:35.580 --> 29:37.580\nsuss it out and you know\n\n29:37.580 --> 29:39.580\nHaldeman knew? Higher.\n\n29:39.580 --> 29:41.580\nHigher than Haldeman?\n\n29:41.580 --> 29:43.580\nErlichman?\n\n29:43.580 --> 29:45.580\nYou know, you're watching guy like\n\n29:45.580 --> 29:47.580\nit's Nixon, you know, like\n\n29:47.580 --> 29:49.580\nyou know that experience?\n\n29:49.580 --> 29:51.580\nThat feeling.\n\n29:51.580 --> 29:53.580\nThis is almost like\n\n29:53.580 --> 29:55.580\nlike people who think that the\n\n29:55.580 --> 29:57.580\ntrade towers, the world trade towers\n\n29:57.580 --> 29:59.580\nwere an inside job.\n\n29:59.580 --> 30:01.580\nWorld trade towers.\n\n30:01.580 --> 30:03.580\nAnd I wasn't even in that town at that time.\n\n30:03.580 --> 30:05.580\nBecause the whole point was not to forget.\n\n30:05.580 --> 30:07.580\nWhat did you do?\n\n30:07.580 --> 30:09.580\nYou immediately forgot.\n\n30:09.580 --> 30:11.580\nYou had two jobs.\n\n30:11.580 --> 30:13.580\nI remember because it's 9-11.\n\n30:13.580 --> 30:15.580\nHe's so used to on Netflix not

structures that are\n\n30:23.580 --> 30:25.580\nbut anyway, I think\n\n30:25.580 --> 30:27.580\npeople are going to look back at us.\n\n30:27.580 --> 30:29.580\nThey're going to look back at us\n\n30:29.580 --> 30:31.580\nand they're going to say\n\n30:31.580 --> 30:33.580\nwhen everybody, whenever they brought up\n\n30:33.580 --> 30:35.580\nyou know, Russia interfered with the\n\n30:35.580 --> 30:37.580\nelections and all the people on the right\n\n30:37.580 --> 30:39.580\nwould say they didn't touch the voting machines\n\n30:39.580 --> 30:41.580\nand everybody on the left would say\n\n30:41.580 --> 30:43.580\nyeah, no, we're not talking about the voting machines.\n\n30:43.580 --> 30:45.580\nNo, we're saying but they influence, absolutely not.\n\n30:45.580 --> 30:47.580\nThose are state things.\n\n30:47.580 --> 30:49.580\nI bet you they fucked with the voting machines.\n\n30:49.580 --> 30:51.580\nI bet you people are going to see\n\n30:51.580 --> 30:53.580\nthese news stories\n\n30:53.580 --> 30:55.580\nin 50 years and say\n\n30:55.580 --> 30:57.580\nhow come they didn't know?\n\n30:57.580 --> 30:59.580\nHow come they wouldn't know that?\n\n30:59.580 --> 31:01.580\nWhat do we know about these folks?\n\n31:01.580 --> 31:03.580\nDo we have enough\n\n31:03.580 --> 31:05.580\ndata to run a reliable\n\n31:05.580 --> 31:07.580\nsimulator of their\n\n31:07.580 --> 31:09.580\nthinking the day they find out\n\n31:09.580 --> 31:11.580\nwe're voting by computer from now on?\n\n31:11.580 --> 31:13.580\nAnd what would it look like?\n\n31:13.580 --> 31:15.580\nWould it look like slot machines?\n\n31:15.580 --> 31:17.580\nWhat would it look like?\n\n31:17.580 --> 31:19.580\nWould it look like 95% chance\n\n31:19.580 --> 31:21.580\nthat Hillary is going to win?\n\n31:21.580 --> 31:23.580\nHe wins.\n\n31:23.580 --> 31:25.580\nEverybody's shocked.\n\n31:25.580 --> 31:27.580\nI can't believe everybody voted for Trump.\n\n31:27.580 --> 31:29.580\nEverybody's shocked.\n\n31:29.580 --> 31:31.580\nAnyway, I think it's a little\n\n31:31.580 --> 31:33.580\nparanoid and it's a little conspiracy theory.\n\n31:33.580 --> 31:35.580\nI'm with you too.\n\n31:35.580 --> 31:37.580\nWhy can't we even think about that?\n\n31:37.580 --> 31:39.580\nPeople would be a lot more on board with that idea\n\n31:39.580 --> 31:41.580\nthan they have been.\n\n31:41.580 --> 31:43.580\nI don't know.\n\n31:43.580 --> 31:45.580\nI've seen a lot of people do stuff\n\n31:45.580 --> 31:47.580\nweird style with computers.\n\n31:47.580 --> 31:49.580\nThere was this guy who died\n\n31:49.580 --> 31:51.580\nin a car\n\n31:51.580 --> 31:53.580\nand then they thought that they\n\n31:53.580 --> 31:55.580\ncyber-terrorismed him.\n\n31:55.580 --> 31:57.580\nAnd then\n\n31:57.580 --> 31:59.580\nthey turned out that\n\n31:59.580 --> 32:01.580\nthey didn't cyber-terrorism him\n\n32:01.580 --> 32:03.580\nbut they said if this\n\n32:03.580 --> 32:05.580\ncyber-terrorism ever happened to someone\n\n32:05.580 --> 32:07.580\nit would look exactly like this\n\n32:07.580 --> 32:09.580\nand everyone's all like I guess it wasn't\n\n32:09.580 --> 32:11.580\nthis and that's what it is now.\n\n32:11.580 --> 32:13.580\nI wouldn't have suggested it if I knew it was a night writer\n\n32:13.580 --> 32:15.580\nbut I think\n\n32:15.580 --> 32:17.580\nI actually like it better as a night writer.\n\n32:17.580 --> 32:19.580\nAnyways.\n\n32:19.580 --> 32:21.580\nAnyways.\n\n32:21.580 --> 32:23.580\nHow are we coping\n\n32:23.580 --> 32:25.580\nwith our post-100-day\n\n32:25.580 --> 32:27.580\n100 days doesn't matter.\n\n32:27.580 --> 32:29.580\nIt's exhaustion.\n\n32:29.580 --> 32:31.580\nNo, but I just mean ideologically.\n\n32:31.580 --> 32:33.580\nRidiculous.\n\n32:33.580 --> 32:35.580\nDon't you feel the normalization setting in\n\n32:35.580 --> 32:37.580\nthe exhaustion where you're just like\n\n32:37.580 --> 32:39.580\nI don't\n\n32:39.580 --> 32:41.580\nI can't keep\n\n32:41.580 --> 32:43.580\nbeing broken hearted anymore.\n\n32:43.580 --> 32:45.580\nThe healthy part of me wants to move on.\n\n32:45.580 --> 32:47.580\nMoving on is called\n\n32:47.580 --> 32:49.580\nnormalizing.\n\n32:49.580 --> 32:51.580\nStopping the fight but then that's pretentious\n\n32:51.580 --> 32:53.580\nbecause then you go I wasn't fighting.\n\n32:53.580 --> 32:55.580\nWhat if I have a hanky on my face?\n\n32:55.580 --> 32:57.580\nI wasn't doing anything badass.\n\n32:57.580 --> 32:59.580\nBut I'm not talking about\n\n32:59.580 --> 33:01.580\nwhether or not anything gets results or solved.\n\n33:01.580 --> 33:03.580\nHanky on your face.\n\n33:03.580 --> 33:05.580\nWell that's what the modern warriors do.\n\n33:05.580 --> 33:07.580\nRight.\n\n33:07.580 --> 33:09.580\nBut just like as an individual\n\n33:09.580 --> 33:11.580\nwhere you think like\n\n33:11.580 --> 33:13.580\nI've gone through this phase, through the phases of\n\n33:13.580 --> 33:15.580\nokay that sucks\n\n33:15.580 --> 33:17.580\nbut good.\n\n33:17.580 --> 33:19.580\nI guess I was kind of spoiled. I guess sucky things don't\n\n33:19.580 --> 33:21.580\nhappen and then it's all me, me, me\n\n33:21.580 --> 33:23.580\nand then you go there. It's not about me and I'm gonna\n\n33:23.580 --> 33:25.580\nI gotta do more stuff and\n\n33:25.580 --> 33:27.580\nI'm gonna buy a gun and just in case\n\n33:27.580 --> 33:29.580\nand I'll just\n\n33:29.580 --> 33:31.580\nall this energy, energy, energy\n\n33:31.580 --> 33:33.580\nand I've truly like the reason I'm confessing\n\n33:33.580 --> 33:35.580\nit is because I want, I feel like\n\n33:35.580 --> 33:37.580\nconfession is better than keeping it a secret.\n\n33:37.580 --> 33:39.580\nIt's like I'm fucking exhausted.\n\n33:39.580 --> 33:41.580\nOh it's exhausting and you kind of hope, I mean I find myself\n\n33:41.580 --> 33:43.580\nhoping boy I hope somebody's really\n\n33:43.580 --> 33:45.580\nkeeping track of all this.\n\n33:45.580 --> 33:47.580\nLike you're trying to memorize all the stuff\n\n33:47.580 --> 33:49.580\nto be outraged about.\n\n33:49.580 --> 33:51.580\nLike we've already forgotten about\n\n33:51.580 --> 33:53.580\nwhen he was acting like his own PR guy.\n\n33:53.580 --> 33:55.580\nYeah.\n\n33:55.580 --> 33:57.580\nLike oh and that!\n\n33:57.580 --> 33:59.580\nAnd it is\n\n33:59.580 --> 34:01.580\nyou do kind of\n\n34:01.580 --> 34:03.580\nyou tip your hat to people who are\n\n34:03.580 --> 34:05.580\nstaying on it\n\n34:05.580 --> 34:07.580\nand you know somebody like Elizabeth\n\n34:07.580 --> 34:09.580\nWarren I've just seen in a lot of interviews\n\n34:09.580 --> 34:11.580\nshe's just like unrattled by it. I mean in a way\n\n34:11.580 --> 34:13.580\nyou almost have to normalize it so that you can\n\n34:13.580 --> 34:15.580\ndeal with it. But there are people in this\n\n34:15.580 --> 34:17.580\ncountry who because\n\n34:17.580 --> 34:19.580\nthey grew up with or work with\n\n34:19.580 --> 34:21.580\nsociopaths in some degree\n\n34:21.580 --> 34:23.580\nthat they and they alone\n\n34:23.580 --> 34:25.580\nare like very\n\n34:25.580 --> 34:27.580\neither more frustrated or less frustrated\n\n34:27.580 --> 34:29.580\nbut in any case they're in a different plane of dealing\n\n34:29.580 --> 34:31.580\nwith this because I think what's happening is we're finding\n\n34:31.580 --> 34:33.580\nout as most hospital\n\n34:33.580 --> 34:35.580\nstaff housing sociopath\n\n34:35.580 --> 34:37.580\nwhich is virtually incurable because\n\n34:37.580 --> 34:39.580\nthey don't want to be cured and\n\n34:39.580 --> 34:41.580\nhere's the key. We\n\n34:41.580 --> 34:43.580\nthink based on our\n\n34:43.580 --> 34:45.580\nreaction to shame\n\n34:45.580 --> 34:47.580\nwhich is usually hardwired into us\n\n34:47.580 --> 34:49.580\nbecause when your parents see at the top of a\n\n34:49.580 --> 34:51.580\nstair and your big ass head\n\n34:51.580 --> 34:53.580\nis going to take you down the stairs and they go\n\n34:53.580 --> 34:55.580\nuh, Hurwitz no!\n\n34:55.580 --> 34:57.580\nBecause your parents probably called you Hurwitz.\n\n34:57.580 --> 34:59.580\nThey put this\n\n34:59.580 --> 35:01.580\nI mean maybe that's even where some of the shame\n\n35:01.580 --> 35:03.580\ncomes from. My therapist calls it healthy shame\n\n35:03.580 --> 35:05.580\nit's like cholesterol there's healthy shame\n\n35:05.580 --> 35:07.580\nthere's toxic shame. You felt\n\n35:07.580 --> 35:09.580\nthat there's nothing more you can do. Healthy shame\n\n35:09.580 --> 35:11.580\nis like oh shit\n\n35:11.580 --> 35:13.580\nI gotta be careful. My mom just got really upset.\n\n35:13.580 --> 35:15.580\nMy mom just got really upset. So\n\n35:15.580 --> 35:17.580\nwe, because we're built, we're hardwired\n\n35:17.580 --> 35:19.580\nwith that stuff, we believe\n\n35:19.580 --> 35:21.580\njustifiably that\n\n35:21.580 --> 35:23.580\nhonesty has\n\n35:23.580 --> 35:25.580\nthis hugely important thing\n\n35:25.580 --> 35:27.580\nlike you draw a line down the middle of the road\n\n35:27.580 --> 35:29.580\nand people are going to tend not to cross it\n\n35:29.580 --> 35:31.580\nwe think it's because it's like keeping\n\n35:31.580 --> 35:33.580\nhonest people honest that thing. Well there's a law\n\n35:33.580 --> 35:35.580\nagainst this so I'm not going to do it. It's\n\n35:35.580 --> 35:37.580\nour fear of shame\n\n35:37.580 --> 35:39.580\nand people who are fascinated with serial\n\n35:39.580 --> 35:41.580\nkillers and werewolves and mafia\n\n35:41.580 --> 35:43.580\nmovies and things. We have a president now\n\n35:43.580 --> 35:45.580\nwho is like fascinating everyone.\n\n35:45.580 --> 35:47.580\nShameless. I mean he's just like he's going\n\n35:47.580 --> 35:49.580\nlike what do you mean? I\n\n35:49.580 --> 35:51.580\ndidn't eat the cookies and he says you have\n\n35:51.580 --> 35:53.580\ncookies in your face and you show a video\n\n35:53.580 --> 35:55.580\nthere's the video of you eating cookies and he goes\n\n35:55.580 --> 35:57.580\nthat video is a real video that's like a cookie video\n\n35:57.580 --> 35:59.580\nlike I was like\n\n35:59.580 --> 36:01.580\nyou ate the video I was like I thought I was a cookie\n\n36:01.580 --> 36:03.580\nthen you ate the cookies I didn't eat anything\n\n36:03.580 --> 36:05.580\nand it's just like he's not\n\n36:05.580 --> 36:07.580\nlying in his head because there is no\n\n36:07.580 --> 36:09.580\nend game it's not like\n\n36:09.580 --> 36:11.580\nno it's just survival it's just like a naked ego\n\n36:11.580 --> 36:13.580\nand all of us are finding out\n\n36:13.580 --> 36:15.580\nthat we're defenseless against that\n\n36:15.580 --> 36:17.580\nbut we have realized that shut up animal\n\n36:17.580 --> 36:19.580\nthat probably means you are\n\n36:19.580 --> 36:21.580\nno if you have an urge to yell it out like that\n\n36:21.580 --> 36:23.580\nyou probably are defenseless\n\n36:23.580 --> 36:25.580\nbut I do think the rest of us are not\n\n36:25.580 --> 36:27.580\ndefenseless\n\n36:27.580 --> 36:29.580\nAdam Goldberg\n\n36:29.580 --> 36:31.580\nAdam Goldberg\n\n36:31.580 --> 36:33.580\nyou have 11 seconds on

stage\n\n36:49.580 --> 36:51.580\nfinally we're getting\n\n36:51.580 --> 36:53.580\njust a dude\n\n36:53.580 --> 36:55.580\ncan we get some masculine representation on the stage\n\n36:55.580 --> 36:57.580\nAdam Goldberg nice to meet you\n\n36:57.580 --> 36:59.580\nI'm the guy they hate so\n\n36:59.580 --> 37:01.580\nyou don't hate you we like you as an enemy\n\n37:01.580 -->

think we get\n\n37:09.580 --> 37:11.580\nyou can't help\n\n37:11.580 --> 37:13.580\nyou can't resist wanting\n\n37:13.580 --> 37:15.580\nwhat happened\n\n37:15.580 --> 37:17.580\nI think\n\n37:17.580 --> 37:19.580\nthey might be reacting to the fact that Adam Goldberg came on stage\n\n37:19.580 --> 37:21.580\nand someone succeeded in just dealing\n\n37:21.580 --> 37:23.580\nwith it\n\n37:23.580 --> 37:25.580\nthat you just continued\n\n37:25.580 --> 37:27.580\nyou're just like I've got so much yard work to do\n\n37:27.580 --> 37:29.580\nand I'm not going to let this stop me\n\n37:29.580 -->

01:15:43.760\nWhat's wrong with my mirror?\n\n01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:46.720\nThe manager suggested we give them two mirrors from now on,\n\n01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:49.720\nStephanie.\n\n01:15:49.720

01:16:07.240\nIt's such a typical night.\n\n01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:09.240\nIt's such a typical night at the 54.\n\n01:16:09.240 --> 01:16:11.360\nIt's shit like this goes down all the time.\n\n01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:11.860\nExactly.\n\n01:16:11.860 --> 01:16:13.560\nI'm sorry to interrupt you on your date,\n\n01:16:13.560 --> 01:16:17.680\nbut I am a cocaine dealer, and I deal only

smoke.\n\n01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:36.160\nAnd then where I was standing, there's just a mirror laying\n\n01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:37.520\non it.\n\n01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:41.760\nRyan, hey, Ryan, it's me, your reflection in the mirror.\n\n01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:46.600\nThis is too many make-em-up hijinks.\n\n01:16:46.600 --> 01:16:47.480\nI can handle it.\n\n01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:48.960\nI don't

things.\n\n01:27:36.280 --> 01:27:37.280\nThere's some scientists in there.\n\n01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:38.280\nOh, really?\n\n01:27:38.280 --> 01:27:39.280\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:27:39.280 --> 01:27:40.280\nScientists are watching you sleep.\n\n01:27:40.280 --> 01:27:41.280\nYou could volunteer.\n\n01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:42.280\nI know.\n\n01:27:42.280 --> 01:27:43.280\nI probably...\n\n01:27:43.280 --> 01:27:44.280\nOr they're getting their PhD.\n\n01:27:44.280 --> 01:27:46.280\nDo you want them to have PhDs?\n\n01:27:46.280 --> 01:27:50.280\nThat's not the most exciting area of expertise, frankly.\n\n01:27:50.280 --> 01:27:52.280\nYou're more like NASA...\n\n01:27:52.280 --> 01:27:53.280\nYeah, cosmic.\n\n01:27:53.280 --> 01:27:55.280\nLike someone who worked on the Land Rover.\n\n01:27:55.280 --> 01:27:56.280\nSo you're angling for...\n\n01:27:56.280 --> 01:27:57.280\nThe Land Rover.\n\n01:27:57.280 --> 01:27:58.280\nThe Mars Rover.\n\n01:27:58.280 --> 01:27:59.280\nA hot...\n\n01:27:59.280 --> 01:28:01.280\nI'll take someone who works at Land Rover over here.\n\n01:28:01.280 --> 01:28:04.280\nOh, because I was going to say, yeah, the guy who worked on my Land Rover has got a daughter.\n\n01:28:04.280 --> 01:28:05.280\nYeah.\n\n01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:07.280\nI can't believe they put a Land Rover on March.\n\n01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:09.280\nThat was amazing.\n\n01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:14.280\nBecause you think that the English car companies wouldn't be able to afford that.\n\n01:28:14.280 --> 01:28:17.280\nSteve Levy!\n\n01:28:17.280 --> 01:28:23.280\nHey Steve, what do you think of the fact that everyone's making me a big joke up here, huh?\n\n01:28:23.280 --> 01:28:26.280\nMy pursuit of love is just a big joke to be mocked.\n\n01:28:26.280 --> 01:28:27.280\nWhat do you think of that, Steve?\n\n01:28:27.280 --> 01:28:29.280\nIs that about love in general or you?\n\n01:28:29.280 --> 01:28:30.280\nNo!\n\n01:28:30.280 --> 01:28:33.280\nBut everybody's making a big joke about my pursuit of love.\n\n01:28:33.280 --> 01:28:34.280\nWhat do you think about that?\n\n01:28:34.280 --> 01:28:36.280\nI mean, I'm sorry.\n\n01:28:36.280 --> 01:28:37.280\nSteve!\n\n01:28:37.280 --> 01:28:38.280\nHey Steve!\n\n01:28:38.280 --> 01:28:39.280\nHey Steve!\n\n01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:40.280\nHey Rob.\n\n01:28:40.280 --> 01:28:41.280\nSteve, do you date a lot?\n\n01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:42.280\nWho's here?\n\n01:28:42.280 --> 01:28:43.280\nNo.\n\n01:28:43.280 --> 01:28:44.280\nWhy not?\n\n01:28:44.280 --> 01:28:45.280\nThat guy likes me.\n\n01:28:45.280 --> 01:28:46.280\nHey John Carman, everybody!\n\n01:28:46.280 --> 01:28:47.280\nWho's...\n\n01:28:47.280 --> 01:28:48.280\nOh, sorry.\n\n01:28:48.280 --> 01:28:51.280\nHe's the Steve Levy of Justin Roiland.\n\n01:28:51.280 --> 01:28:53.280\nI know, but it's...\n\n01:28:53.280 --> 01:28:56.280\nAlright, John Carman, stand up here so they can see the joke.\n\n01:28:56.280 --> 01:28:57.280\nWe'll get to my question later.\n\n01:28:57.280 --> 01:28:59.280\nI don't date to answer your question.\n\n01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:00.280\nHold on.\n\n01:29:00.280 --> 01:29:05.280\nNow, since Steve Levy gave me such a dissatisfying answer, John Carman, what do you think about\n\n01:29:05.280 --> 01:29:10.280\nall these jokers making a big old funny thing about my pursuit of love?\n\n01:29:10.280 --> 01:29:12.280\nUse your own mic.\n\n01:29:12.280 --> 01:29:15.280\nLook, Ryan, I'm in the same boat as you, so...\n\n01:29:15.280 --> 01:29:21.280\nI was picturing myself in your position at Studio 54 and it was just, you know, I would've\n\n01:29:21.280 --> 01:29:22.280\ndone the same thing.\n\n01:29:22.280 --> 01:29:26.280\nHe doesn't seem like I got Levy and then Justin got Synthetic Levy.\n\n01:29:26.280 --> 01:29:28.280\nThat's what I always call it.\n\n01:29:28.280 --> 01:29:29.280\nYou didn't even learn my name.\n\n01:29:29.280 --> 01:29:30.280\nThat's all you called me at work.\n\n01:29:30.280 --> 01:29:31.280\nSynthetic Levy.\n\n01:29:31.280 --> 01:29:32.280\nYeah.\n\n01:29:32.280 --> 01:29:35.280\nBut you hung in there.\n\n01:29:35.280 --> 01:29:38.280\nYou didn't go like, Synthetic Levy, I'm outta here.\n\n01:29:38.280 --> 01:29:41.280\nYou're like, okay, I guess that's my name.\n\n01:29:41.280 --> 01:29:43.280\nHe's Justin Roiland's assistant.\n\n01:29:43.280 --> 01:29:46.280\nI'd say his skin is pretty thick and his brain is pretty...\n\n01:29:46.280 --> 01:29:47.280\nThick.\n\n01:29:47.280 --> 01:29:48.280\n...bordified?\n\n01:29:48.280 --> 01:29:49.280\nCareful.\n\n01:29:49.280 --> 01:29:51.280\nYou would not believe the shit you're seeing.\n\n01:29:51.280 --> 01:29:53.280\nYou're Justin Roiland's assistant?\n\n01:29:53.280 --> 01:29:54.280\nI am.\n\n01:29:54.280 --> 01:29:56.280\nTake us,

right now?\n\n01:30:03.280 --> 01:30:04.280\nSomebody tell me what I'm supposed to do.\n\n01:30:04.280 --> 01:30:06.280\nI need some kind of Rubik's snake to put together.\n\n01:30:06.280 --> 01:30:07.280\nWhat am I doing?\n\n01:30:07.280 --> 01:30:08.280\nWhat am I doing?\n\n01:30:08.280 --> 01:30:10.280\nSomebody tell me what I'm supposed to do.\n\n01:30:10.280 --> 01:30:11.280\nYou have

point.\n\n01:32:17.160 --> 01:32:20.440\nAre you, are you, are you, are you Steve Levy?\n\n01:32:20.440 --> 01:32:21.360\nYeah.\n\n01:32:21.360 --> 01:32:26.000\nI was told by Tumber to meet you here.\n\n01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:27.400\nI'm, I'm in drama though.\n\n01:32:27.400 --> 01:32:29.200\nI'm sorry, who, who?\n\n01:32:29.200 --> 01:32:31.000\nTumber, the app that we use.\n\n01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:31.840\nOh, right.\n\n01:32:31.840 --> 01:32:33.320\nTheir slogan is it's not a tumor.\n\n01:32:35.720 --> 01:32:36.760\nBecause it has a B in it.\n\n01:32:36.760 --> 01:32:37.720\nIt's a good start.\n\n01:32:37.720 --> 01:32:38.720\nIt's spreading.\n\n01:32:38.720 --> 01:32:47.640\nIt's something spreading.\n\n01:32:47.640 --> 01:32:51.040\nDid you notice the sense of wonderment in his voice?\n\n01:32:51.040 --> 01:32:52.880\nHe acted, Ryan, I'm talking to you, motherfu-\n\n01:32:52.880 --> 01:32:54.280\nI was up in my head.\n\n01:32:54.280 --> 01:32:56.120\nYou need to watch, because so far Steve\n\n01:32:56.120 --> 01:32:59.560\nis off to a pretty good look.\n\n01:32:59.560 --> 01:33:00.160\nHi.\n\n01:33:00.160 --> 01:33:01.480\nHi, Andromeda.\n\n01:33:01.480 --> 01:33:02.240\nHi.\n\n01:33:02.240 --> 01:33:06.000\nBut, so you, you tracked me down?\n\n01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000\nWe didn't get connected?\n\n01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:11.440\nLook at his establishment.\n\n01:33:11.440 --> 01:33:14.600\nNo, we, I don't want to say no, because that's bad improv,\n\n01:33:14.600 --> 01:33:18.720\nbut the idea is that we agreed to meet here.\n\n01:33:18.720 --> 01:33:20.160\nOh, we did.\n\n01:33:20.160 --> 01:33:21.520\nSorry.\n\n01:33:21.520 --> 01:33:22.320\nHe apologized.\n\n01:33:22.320 --> 01:33:26.320\nI run like, I run like four calendars, including my own.\n\n01:33:26.320 --> 01:33:30.040\nIt's really, it's hard to keep up with everything.\n\n01:33:30.040 --> 01:33:31.280\nWhy is that her problem?\n\n01:33:31.280 --> 01:33:39.600\nListen, let me tell you upfront, if we're going to start dating,\n\n01:33:39.600 --> 01:33:43.320\nI'm not going to have very much time for you.\n\n01:33:43.320 --> 01:33:45.800\nWhy are you, is your job important to you?\n\n01:33:45.800 --> 01:33:48.560\nMy job is, I'm a workaholic.\n\n01:33:48.560 --> 01:33:50.640\nWell, maybe it's worth that.\n\n01:33:50.640 --> 01:33:53.320\nTell me more about what you do for a living,\n\n01:33:53.320 --> 01:33:57.000\nand I could probably support it.\n\n01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:58.800\nSo I work in television.\n\n01:33:58.800 -->

zombie hunters.\n\n01:40:56.040 --> 01:40:58.360\nWhat are you, an assistant to a genius?\n\n01:40:58.360 --> 01:41:00.640\nThat sounds, that's a fucking cakewalk.\n\n01:41:00.640 --> 01:41:03.560\nI dream of that job.\n\n01:41:03.560 --> 01:41:04.160\nNoted.\n\n01:41:04.160 --> 01:41:07.840\nIt's worth an 11 PM text letting you know that the fucking\n\n01:41:07.840 --> 01:41:08.960\ntelevision doesn't work.\n\n01:41:08.960 --> 01:41:11.840\nAnd here's why Steve.\n\n01:41:11.840 --> 01:41:14.720\nBecause poor people can turn on their televisions.\n\n01:41:14.720 --> 01:41:16.760\nPoor people can turn on their televisions.\n\n01:41:16.760 --> 01:41:17.720\nI've heard this.\n\n01:41:17.720 --> 01:41:18.560\nThat's true.\n\n01:41:18.560 --> 01:41:21.760\nI've been going to Best Buy right now and for $600\n\n01:41:21.760 --> 01:41:24.440\nhave a device that turns on and off a TV.\n\n01:41:24.440 --> 01:41:27.640\nIt's fucked up for someone to pay $200,000 for a home\n\n01:41:27.640 --> 01:41:30.720\nautomation system so that they can wait for permission\n\n01:41:30.720 --> 01:41:34.480\nto watch X-Files from some dips in in Malibu.\n\n01:41:34.480 --> 01:41:35.480\nYeah.\n\n01:41:35.480 --> 01:41:35.980\nWow.\n\n01:41:35.980 --> 01:41:37.240\nIt's emasculating.\n\n01:41:37.240 --> 01:41:38.520\nIt's emasculating.\n\n01:41:38.520 --> 01:41:40.000\nI'm on his side.\n\n01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:41.200\nYou're as passionate as my boss.\n\n01:41:41.200 --> 01:41:42.840\nYou should meet that guy.\n\n01:41:42.840 --> 01:41:44.000\nSteve, it's me.\n\n01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:45.920\nThere's no such thing as a fake zombie hunter.\n\n01:41:45.920 --> 01:41:47.200\nIt's me.\n\n01:41:47.200 --> 01:41:48.480\nYou got me again.\n\n01:41:48.480 --> 01:41:49.840\nI'm sorry, Steve.\n\n01:41:49.840 --> 01:41:51.840\nHey, Dan, as long as you're on the phone, hey,\n\n01:41:51.840 --> 01:41:54.000\ncould you talk to me for a second?\n\n01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:57.320\nJustin, don't finish editing episode 304.\n\n01:41:57.320 --> 01:41:58.520\nIt's the worst.\n\n01:42:01.080 --> 01:42:01.960\nThat's not true.\n\n01:42:01.960 --> 01:42:08.440\nIt's going to be the worst episode of Rick and\n\n01:42:08.440 --> 01:42:08.940\nJason.\n\n01:42:08.940 --> 01:42:09.440\nIt's OK.\n\n01:42:09.440 --> 01:42:10.680\nThere's two good ones before it.\n\n01:42:10.680 --> 01:42:12.560\nI need to get this off my chest.\n\n01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:15.600\nYou're mean to me and you hurt my feelings about that picnic\n\n01:42:15.600 --> 01:42:17.520\nthing that I did the other day.\n\n01:42:17.520 --> 01:42:21.360\nWhen I was doing the picnic thing, you don't even remember.\n\n01:42:21.360 --> 01:42:23.840\nNo.\n\n01:42:23.840 --> 01:42:24.960\nSteve, I'm sorry.\n\n01:42:24.960 --> 01:42:28.080\nWhy are you looking at me?\n\n01:42:28.080 --> 01:42:32.240\nJustin, let's try to make season four as good as we can.\n\n01:42:32.240 --> 01:42:33.560\nAndromeda, one second.\n\n01:42:33.560 --> 01:42:36.040\nI'm so sorry that this is still going on.\n\n01:42:36.040 --> 01:42:37.160\nOne second.\n\n01:42:37.160 --> 01:42:38.120\nThis is Chevy Chase.\n\n01:42:38.120 --> 01:42:40.240\nI'm still on the line.\n\n01:42:40.240 --> 01:42:41.840\nShould I hang up?\n\n01:42:41.840 --> 01:42:43.960\nI don't even know what's going on.\n\n01:42:43.960 --> 01:42:45.880\nI'm so drunk on Box Wine.\n\n01:42:45.880 --> 01:42:46.520\nSteve, listen.\n\n01:42:46.520 --> 01:42:48.320\nZombie hunters are real.\n\n01:42:48.320 --> 01:42:50.720\nNo one's going to tell you that's the truth.\n\n01:42:50.720 --> 01:42:53.080\nSo listen to any zombie hunters telling you the truth.\n\n01:42:53.080 --> 01:42:54.240\nI love you so much.\n\n01:42:54.240 --> 01:42:55.520\nI'm so happier in my life.\n\n01:42:55.520 --> 01:42:58.680\nDo you know Chevy Chase?\n\n01:42:58.680 --> 01:42:59.960\nYou know Chevy Chase?\n\n01:42:59.960 --> 01:43:00.800\nI don't.\n\n01:43:00.800 --> 01:43:01.960\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:43:01.960 --> 01:43:03.200\nBut he's been on the phone.\n\n01:43:03.200 --> 01:43:04.920\nI'm still here.\n\n01:43:04.920

Andromeda?\n\n01:43:41.560 --> 01:43:43.080\nYes.\n\n01:43:43.080 --> 01:43:46.240\nI'm going to listen to a podcast with Cody.\n\n01:43:46.240 --> 01:43:48.880\nYou have a great date with Steve.\n\n01:43:48.880 --> 01:43:52.080\nAll right, Dan.\n\n01:43:52.080 --> 01:43:53.320\nAnd for the record?\n\n01:43:53.320 --> 01:43:54.280\nYes.\n\n01:43:54.280 --> 01:43:57.560\nI'm glad you're not Joss Whedon.\n\n01:43:57.560 --> 01:43:59.760\nThank you.\n\n01:43:59.760 --> 01:44:01.880\nDon't get her, Steve.\n\n01:44:01.880 --> 01:44:03.040\nThanks, Dan.\n\n01:44:03.040 --> 01:44:04.960\nOr him or whatever.\n\n01:44:04.960 --> 01:44:05.800\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n01:44:05.800 --> 01:44:08.000\nI advocate whatever it is that's going on\n\n01:44:08.000 -->

01:44:15.440\nSo that's what you do for a living.\n\n01:44:15.440 --> 01:44:17.920\nThat's a just tell people you're overwhelmed.\n\n01:44:17.920 --> 01:44:22.600\nThat's 15 minutes in the life of Levy.\n\n01:44:22.600 --> 01:44:24.680\nYou do that on the weekends, too?\n\n01:44:24.680 --> 01:44:25.960\nOn the, yeah.\n\n01:44:25.960 --> 01:44:28.760\nAnd that's just a tip of the iceberg.\n\n01:44:28.760 --> 01:44:29.480\nYeah.\n\n01:44:29.480 --> 01:44:33.680\nWell, I work at fucking Staples.\n\n01:44:33.680 --> 01:44:34.560\nTell me about it.\n\n01:44:34.560 --> 01:44:37.560\nSo, from my perspective, it's called privilege.\n\n01:44:37.560 --> 01:44:39.120\nYeah.\n\n01:44:39.120 --> 01:44:40.800\nGo finger.\n\n01:44:40.800 --> 01:44:45.280\nAnd if I get pregnant, I don't work at Staples anymore.\n\n01:44:45.280 --> 01:44:48.000\nAnd if I have a baby, I can't work at Staples\n\n01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:51.400\nuntil the baby's old enough to work at Staples, in which case\n\n01:44:51.400 --> 01:44:55.160\nhe'll get paid more than me.\n\n01:44:55.160 --> 01:45:00.160\nSo, smallest violin.\n\n01:45:00.160 --> 01:45:01.000\nBut I'm sorry.\n\n01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:05.080\nI'm a combative young lady that's your age\n\n01:45:05.080 --> 01:45:08.360\nthat I think would be good for you.\n\n01:45:08.360 --> 01:45:10.760\nThank

answers,\n\n01:45:15.840 --> 01:45:18.400\nlike the involvement of the butthole?\n\n01:45:18.400 --> 01:45:26.200\nLike, if I'm blowing you pinky, tickle the rim, no involvement?\n\n01:45:26.200 --> 01:45:27.520\nAnswer carefully.\n\n01:45:27.520 --> 01:45:34.320\nHonestly, I've never tried it, but I've\n\n01:45:34.320 --> 01:45:36.080\nsuggested it to other people.\n\n01:45:39.080 --> 01:45:40.400\nGood answer.\n\n01:45:40.400 --> 01:45:43.800\nIt's a dangerous game.\n\n01:45:43.800 --> 01:45:45.880\nIt's the most dangerous game.\n\n01:45:49.440 --> 01:45:53.240\nYou're like the vampiric dot of butt play.\n\n01:45:53.240 --> 01:45:55.560\nIt's also the plot of the ring three.\n\n01:45:55.560 --> 01:45:59.560\nYeah.\n\n01:45:59.560 --> 01:46:00.080\nAll right.\n\n01:46:00.080 --> 01:46:02.120\nIt's almost worth interrupting to say,\n\n01:46:02.120 --> 01:46:04.680\nwhat do you mean you've suggested it to other people?\n\n01:46:04.680 --> 01:46:06.680\nWhat?\n\n01:46:06.680 --> 01:46:09.240\nLike, the people that you're a wist or a wist?\n\n01:46:09.240 --> 01:46:10.960\nNo, I mean, it was about him, wasn't it?\n\n01:46:10.960 --> 01:46:13.280\nOh, oh, oh, oh.\n\n01:46:13.280 --> 01:46:16.200\nYou ever suggested this to people?\n\n01:46:16.200 --> 01:46:21.280\nPersonally, I have no butthole experience.\n\n01:46:21.280 --> 01:46:22.040\nLet's see it.\n\n01:46:22.040 --> 01:46:25.120\nBut it was, we changed that tonight, huh?\n\n01:46:25.120 --> 01:46:26.640\nHow many people?\n\n01:46:26.640 --> 01:46:29.520\nButthole experience.\n\n01:46:29.520 --> 01:46:30.040\nAll right.\n\n01:46:30.040 --> 01:46:34.280\nWell, what have we learned over six years?\n\n01:46:34.280 --> 01:46:37.680\nUse the right pronouns.\n\n01:46:37.680 --> 01:46:39.040\nTrump will never get elected.\n\n01:46:41.800 --> 01:46:50.360\nThird parties, the way to go, we're evolving.\n\n01:46:50.360 --> 01:46:53.920\nTV's getting better and better.\n\n01:46:53.920 --> 01:47:01.600\nJesus, Annie, happiness will win out in the end.\n\n01:47:01.600 --> 01:47:06.240\nA 10-day waiting period is more than enough for a gun.\n\n01:47:06.240 --> 01:47:08.520\nI still haven't picked mine up yet.\n\n01:47:08.520 --> 01:47:12.000\nBut also, unfortunately, that applies to watching Atlanta\n\n01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:15.480\nand Get Out, which I still haven't done.\n\n01:47:15.480 --> 01:47:19.600\nYou tried getting out and going and buying tickets to shit\n\n01:47:19.600 --> 01:47:22.800\nwhen your knee hurts.\n\n01:47:22.800 --> 01:47:27.480\nYou don't have to buy tickets to Atlanta, it's a TV show.\n\n01:47:27.480 --> 01:47:30.360\nYou're going out and doing stuff because your apartment's\n\n01:47:30.360 --> 01:47:33.200\nhot, because you're poor.\n\n01:47:33.200 --> 01:47:34.760\nWhat's your over 40?\n\n01:47:34.760 --> 01:47:36.320\nYou're going to want to hang out.\n\n01:47:36.320 --> 01:47:41.200\nAre you allowed to get a gun to see movies about black people?\n\n01:47:41.200 --> 01:47:44.600\nOh, come on.\n\n01:47:44.600 --> 01:47:48.440\nI'm so glad there was not a mic on him for that.\n\n01:47:48.440 --> 01:47:50.520\nAnyways, well, here's where we were born.\n\n01:47:50.520 --> 01:47:53.320\nHere's not where we're dying, but Harmontown\n\n01:47:53.320 --> 01:47:57.640\nis moving out from its parents' basement.\n\n01:47:57.640 --> 01:47:59.240\nBut we're taking you with us.\n\n01:48:02.600 --> 01:48:05.600\nUnder your seat is a glass of Kool-Aid and a tablet.\n\n01:48:08.600 --> 01:48:14.200\nWe're moving into our beating curtain attic with Jan.\n\n01:48:14.200 --> 01:48:19.960\nAnd we're going to learn what speakers actually cost.\n\n01:48:19.960 --> 01:48:23.600\nAnd all the other things that happen in your 20s,\n\n01:48:23.600 --> 01:48:25.440\nwhich in podcast years, Harmontown\n\n01:48:25.440 --> 01:48:27.400\nis interested in its mid-20s.\n\n01:48:27.400 --> 01:48:28.680\nWe're leveling up.\n\n01:48:28.680 --> 01:48:30.040\nThe show's only going to get better.\n\n01:48:30.040 --> 01:48:33.280\nJustin's wearing white now.\n\n01:48:33.280 --> 01:48:36.680\nWe got two Leaves.\n\n01:48:36.680 --> 01:48:40.040\nOne's made of straw.\n\n01:48:40.040 --> 01:48:43.760\nIt's just a Leaves-shaped scarecrow.\n\n01:48:43.760 --> 01:48:46.920\nAnd then he's going to wear a suit the entire time,\n\n01:48:46.920 --> 01:48:48.840\nand I'm going to wear lumberjack shirts and shorts.\n\n01:48:48.840 --> 01:48:51.320\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:48:51.320 --> 01:48:52.680\nThat's a, oh, yeah.\n\n01:48:52.680 --> 01:48:54.800\nBut we're going to renew, probably,\n\n01:48:54.800 -->

we're giving up\n\n01:49:00.120 --> 01:49:02.320\nbecause we do believe that people are stupid.\n\n01:49:02.320 --> 01:49:04.760\nBut we're going to continue to care about them and love them.\n\n01:49:04.760 --> 01:49:05.960\nBut we know that they're stupid.\n\n01:49:05.960 --> 01:49:07.400\nWe just don't expect any more of them.\n\n01:49:07.400 --> 01:49:09.880\nThe planet's going to be eaten alive by dumb people.\n\n01:49:09.880 --> 01:49:12.080\nYou know, Dan, we only have a couple minutes left.\n\n01:49:12.080 --> 01:49:14.400\nWhy don't we just wrap it out in good

--> 01:49:50.880\nNo, I think this whole rap has to be Mitch Hurwitz only.\n\n01:49:50.880 --> 01:49:52.640\nI think it has to be Mitch.\n\n01:49:52.640 --> 01:49:56.800\nYou know, I don't know a lot about the Founding Fathers,\n\n01:49:56.800 --> 01:49:58.120\nso my rap isn't great.\n\n01:49:58.120 --> 01:50:00.120\nOh!\n\n01:50:00.120 --> 01:50:01.480\nYou know, that bitch is crazy.\n\n01:50:01.480 --> 01:50:02.320\nIt was Ben Franklin.\n\n01:50:02.320 --> 01:50:02.960\nI know that.\n\n01:50:02.960 --> 01:50:05.920\nI don't know how to rap.\n\n01:50:05.920 --> 01:50:06.920\nRap!\n\n01:50:06.920 --> 01:50:08.920\nI'll do some rap.\n\n01:50:08.920 --> 01:50:10.920\nIt's a rap.\n\n01:50:10.920 --> 01:50:11.920\nRap!\n\n01:50:11.920 --> 01:50:13.640\nI don't know what it is.\n\n01:50:13.640 --> 01:50:14.600\nRap.\n\n01:50:14.600 --> 01:50:15.840\nIt's a game you play.\n\n01:50:15.840 --> 01:50:17.080\nWith your mouth.\n\n01:50:17.080 --> 01:50:19.640\nAt the end of the day, you just move your lips.\n\n01:50:19.640 --> 01:50:21.120\nAnd the words come out.\n\n01:50:21.120 --> 01:50:23.440\nTeeth go up, and your lips go south.\n\n01:50:23.440 --> 01:50:26.120\nYou got to say what you're on your mind.\n\n01:50:26.120 --> 01:50:29.560\nThen you say what you can find in your soul.\n\n01:50:29.560 --> 01:50:32.080\nWhen you look down deep, I fucked your mama so hard,\n\n01:50:32.080 --> 01:50:33.560\nshe turned into a sheep.\n\n01:50:33.560 --> 01:50:34.800\nOh.\n\n01:50:34.800 --> 01:50:37.320\nAnd then she counted herself going up and down\n\n01:50:37.320 --> 01:50:38.480\nup to the upper shelf.\n\n01:50:38.480 --> 01:50:39.720\nI got her pussy up high.\n\n01:50:39.720 --> 01:50:41.040\nI got her pussy down low.\n\n01:50:41.040 --> 01:50:42.400\nI got her pussy in the middle.\n\n01:50:42.400 --> 01:50:43.520\nAnd away we go.\n\n01:50:43.520 --> 01:50:46.440\nYo, Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan.\n\n01:50:46.440 --> 01:50:49.000\nHow many mamas do you think you fucked so far?\n\n01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:50.800\n5,000.\n\n01:50:50.800 --> 01:50:53.160\nMother fucker.\n\n01:50:53.160 --> 01:50:54.120\nRound number.\n\n01:50:56.840 --> 01:50:57.640\nThanks for asking.\n\n01:51:00.640 --> 01:51:02.640\nI'll tell you about every single one of them.\n\n01:51:02.640 --> 01:51:04.120\nOh.\n\n01:51:04.120 --> 01:51:05.280\nMother number one.\n\n01:51:05.280 --> 01:51:06.600\nI fucked to the son.\n\n01:51:06.600 --> 01:51:07.760\nMother number two.\n\n01:51:07.760 --> 01:51:09.120\nI fucked with some goo.\n\n01:51:09.120 --> 01:51:10.320\nMother number three.\n\n01:51:10.320 --> 01:51:11.400\nI fucked it instead of peeing.\n\n01:51:11.400 --> 01:51:12.560\nAnd so no mother number four.\n\n01:51:12.560 --> 01:51:14.280\nI made my penis kind of sore.\n\n01:51:14.280 --> 01:51:15.320\nMother number five.\n\n01:51:15.320 --> 01:51:16.800\nI brought my dick back alive.\n\n01:51:16.800 --> 01:51:17.960\nMother number six.\n\n01:51:17.960 --> 01:51:19.000\nI fucked with some sticks.\n\n01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:20.440\nIt was gross.\n\n01:51:20.440 --> 01:51:21.480\nBut she asked for it.\n\n01:51:21.480 --> 01:51:22.800\nIt was consensual.\n\n01:51:22.800 --> 01:51:25.680\nAnd that's all I'm going to say about it.\n\n01:51:25.680 --> 01:51:27.400\nMother number seven.\n\n01:51:27.400 --> 01:51:29.120\nThe only thing that's going to rhyme is heaven.\n\n01:51:29.120 --> 01:51:30.280\nYou already know that.\n\n01:51:30.280 --> 01:51:31.920\nSo that's where I fucked her.\n\n01:51:31.920 --> 01:51:33.160\nMother number eight.\n\n01:51:33.160 --> 01:51:33.920\nWho knows?\n\n01:51:33.920 --> 01:51:34.560\nWait.\n\n01:51:34.560 --> 01:51:35.800\nOh.\n\n01:51:35.800 --> 01:51:37.280\nMother number nine.\n\n01:51:37.280 --> 01:51:38.000\nWhoa.\n\n01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:39.280\nThat mother was fine.\n\n01:51:39.280 --> 01:51:40.480\nShe was so fine.\n\n01:51:40.480 --> 01:51:41.760\nI never fucked her again.\n\n01:51:41.760 --> 01:51:45.560\nBut then you long came mother 10.\n\n01:51:45.560 --> 01:51:49.700\nMother 11 was a lot like mother seven.\n\n01:51:49.700 --> 01:51:51.520\nMother number 12 into what I won't\n\n01:51:51.520 --> 01:51:56.080\ndwell because privacy was her main thing.\n\n01:51:56.080 --> 01:51:59.080\nAlong with lack of rhyming.\n\n01:51:59.080 --> 01:52:00.600\nMother number 13.\n\n01:52:00.600 --> 01:52:01.600\nWas it Jelly Bean?\n\n01:52:01.600 --> 01:52:03.420\nI'm going to fucking to fucking to fucking\n\n01:52:03.420 --> 01:52:07.080\nto fuck on another fucking piece.\n\n01:52:07.080 --> 01:52:08.440\nThat's not don't applaud that.\n\n01:52:08.440 --> 01:52:09.160\nDon't applaud that.\n\n01:52:09.160 --> 01:52:11.200\nThat's not.\n\n01:52:11.200 --> 01:52:13.900\nmother 14 and then there's a bunch of mothers that would only rhyme with\n\n01:52:13.900 --> 01:52:16.100\nWe have 4,989 to go\n\n01:52:16.100 --> 01:52:20.500\nMother 4,900 wasn't so good and my dick got all scrundled\n\n01:52:20.500 --> 01:52:27.200\nI made up words because by that time I was ready to fuck birds and I fucked your mama's till I could fly\n\n01:52:27.200 --> 01:52:32.200\nI put some wings on my dick and went up so high went up to heaven said hi to mother number seven\n\n01:52:32.200 --> 01:52:36.200\nand came down and fucked mother again\n\n01:52:36.200 --> 01:52:40.200\nbut here's what I learned from fucking all those mothers\n\n01:52:40.200 --> 01:52:43.200\nthere's no other like a mother\n\n01:52:43.200 --> 01:52:48.200\nyou can't even fuck a brother and have it be as good as a mother\n\n01:52:48.200 --> 01:52:51.200\nbut that's not a homophobic statement\n\n01:52:51.200 --> 01:52:55.200\nbecause if you're gay then your brother can be a mother\n\n01:52:55.200 --> 01:52:59.200\nbut that's not saying gay people are incestuous\n\n01:52:59.200 --> 01:53:02.200\nI should probably get out of this area\n\n01:53:02.200 --> 01:53:10.200\none of the things we learned at this space is that there takes a lot of people to make a human race\n\n01:53:10.200 --> 01:53:15.200\nthere's people that are born one way and say hey I'm gonna be another way\n\n01:53:15.200 --> 01:53:18.200\nand why would you bother to say hey why are you gonna be that way\n\n01:53:18.200 --> 01:53:22.200\nthat doesn't make any sense there's a lot of better ways to spend your energy\n\n01:53:22.200 --> 01:53:26.200\nand if you're lazy you're actually progressive because you're like who gives a shit\n\n01:53:26.200 --> 01:53:28.200\nand a lot of people are like thank you\n\n01:53:28.200 --> 01:53:32.200\nit's when we care that we really end up fucking everything up\n\n01:53:32.200 --> 01:53:35.200\nespecially when we care about ourselves\n\n01:53:35.200 --> 01:53:38.200\nyou should always thank you ma'am\n\n01:53:38.200 --> 01:53:42.200\nnot to call you ma'am you can be anything you want\n\n01:53:42.200 --> 01:53:45.200\nthat's what we learned the most\n\n01:53:45.200 --> 01:53:48.200\nsix years go by like a flash of the pan\n\n01:53:48.200 --> 01:53:51.200\nI fucked your mama till my name was Dan\n\n01:53:51.200 --> 01:53:53.200\nI fucked your mama all over the land\n\n01:53:53.200 --> 01:53:56.200\nI fucked it from the horizon to the frying pan\n\n01:53:56.200 --> 01:53:58.200\nand we went I put a piece of butter on it\n\n01:53:58.200 --> 01:54:00.200\nokay alright\n\n01:54:00.200 --> 01:54:02.200\noh shit\n\n01:54:05.200 -->
