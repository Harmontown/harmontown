WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:26.000
Stay on the beat!

00:26.000 --> 00:29.000
Hello white people!

00:29.000 --> 00:32.000
With almost no censored rhythm

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
from Hollywood, California

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
Harmontown is now in session!

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
Spencer Crittenden

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
Spencer

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
The mayor of Harmontown

00:56.000 --> 01:00.000
Dan Harmon

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
Hello!

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
Hello!

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
Hello!

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
Thank you, thank you very much.

01:08.000 --> 01:13.000
I was just watching Lady Gaga's half-time thing.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
It's pretty awesome.

01:15.000 --> 01:20.000
I risk nothing by saying I admire Lady Gaga.

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
No one's going to boo me for saying that.

01:24.000 --> 01:28.000
Well, one person wants to be special.

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
That's more just you cheering yourself.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
Cheering narcissism.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
I'm not your average fan!

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
People on Twitter are always tweeting at me

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
and going like,

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
I know you won't say anything

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
unless I say something negative.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
So fuck you!

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
Just kidding, I love your work.

01:48.000 --> 01:57.000
You're not wrong, but I black people that do that

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
because I'm just like,

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
fuck you, then you're worse.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
You're worse than bad people.

02:00.000 --> 02:06.000
If you truly love me,

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
you should accept my laziness.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
You should be my codependent lover.

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
You should just support me.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
And my good mood should be your good mood.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
You should need anything from me.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
Or I'm out the door!

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
And you know that about me.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
You've learned that about me.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
You've put up with four years of abuse.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
You've lied to doctors for me.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
Too soon.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
Too soon.

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
And 60,000 years of misogyny.

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
What was it that struck you positively

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
about Lady Gaga?

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
Well, first of all, her fucking,

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
not only her wire work in general,

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
but as a decision is always in a me.

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
I admire anyone who chooses wire work.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
From Garth Brooks to Beyonce to anybody.

02:53.000 --> 02:58.000
If you say, bring out wires,

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
I'm already on your side.

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
I'm not going to side with gravity.

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
I don't hope you fall and hurt yourself.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
I admire you, and I wouldn't be willing to do it.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
But then, having chosen wires,

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
she didn't just,

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
as you know, I've been in the shit.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
I was at Radio City Music Hall.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
I wrote for the 2006 VMAs.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
Beyonce, queen me,

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
she came plummeted down on some fucking wires.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
I watched her rehearse.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
She's a pro.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
Studdingly gorgeous, amazing woman.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
Great wire work.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
She's great.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
But Lady Gaga, so many years later,

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
starts at the top of the stadium.

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
She jumped off a regular person.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
But then it cut wide,

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
and she was doing this Spider-Man jiggle

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
on the way down.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
And I thought that was a cool thing to commit to.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
Here's what I liked about Lady Gaga's performance.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
She did everything that I would do

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
if I was in wires.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
I would also do that on the way down,

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
because I'd be like a little spider.

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
She didn't try to act like it's natural

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
that she's like Helen Slater and Supergirl.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
I want to give some props to the people

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
that created that rig, because those harnesses,

04:11.000 --> 04:15.000
she was wearing a very small, skimpy outfit.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
She has a very tiny rig underneath that,

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
and that's not comfortable.

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
For that to work, it's tighter than you want it to be,

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
for that to be a safe mechanism.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
She committed to lip-syncing a whole thing,

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
but there's no way to sing when you have that thing on you,

04:33.000 --> 04:37.000
because she's wearing a girdle made of girdles.

04:37.000 --> 04:41.000
She took your lover, your life partner,

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
your S.O. church,

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
we were watching in the green room,

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
and she really successfully took a Supergirl halftime

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
and made it look like one of her videos,

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
which is a huge feat for the whole team.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
I thought it looked wonderful.

04:53.000 --> 04:58.000
I don't understand what was Neil Patrick Harris

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
trying to tweet when he said he was gagging

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
over her halftime show, because she's the best.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
Did he mean to say gagaing?

05:07.000 --> 05:11.000
Or is this new slang from the streets

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
that I got to catch up to?

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
Man, I was gagging.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
You're amazing.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
Your haircut's making me gag.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
What? Fuck you!

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
Gotcha, it's the future.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
Now, is Enti here today?

05:27.000 --> 05:31.000
Enti Kwaku, he tweeted,

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
he goes, I actually really like that.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
He was down for that. He thought that was super cool.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
But I think more importantly than Lady Gaga's performance,

05:38.000 --> 05:42.000
I think it's time to have a good old fashioned sports corner.

05:42.000 --> 05:54.000
Well, Jeff, I gotta tell you, I mean...

05:54.000 --> 06:03.000
So, where do I start?

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
The fact that the Falcons lost a 25 point lead

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
in the second half of the game?

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
Oh shit!

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
Wait, this is the first Super Bowl in history

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
that was won in overtime?

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
This guy did homework.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
Yeah, because I was looking for Lady Gaga's video.

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
I got spoiled.

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
Aside from Tom Brady, name one other player.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
Bill Bilicheck.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
Because I also saw Richard Spencer's tweet.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
Richard Spencer was given, he's now on Twitter,

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
he's like a racist gourmand.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
He was like, I'm going for the Patriots

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
and he had a little checklist.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
It was like Tom Brady and Bilicheck both support Trump.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
More white receivers.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
He had all the racial stats for the Patriots.

06:50.000 --> 06:54.000
The only team with three white receivers?

06:54.000 --> 06:58.000
Yeah, he loves how white the football team is.

06:58.000 --> 07:02.000
But typically people who are giving you sports statistics

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
are helping you bet and win,

07:04.000 --> 07:08.000
but he's just like, you know, my money's on the master race.

07:08.000 --> 07:14.000
Smart money is not on Arians for athletics

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
since the 1936 Olympics.

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
It's like, it's never been.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
We settled that a long time ago.

07:23.000 --> 07:28.000
Steve Bannon looks like the time I tried to shave my sack.

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
And absolutely failed.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
As I tweeted today, he looks just like Bilicheck.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
They both wear the same headset.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
Beards are in Steve Bannon.

07:37.000 --> 07:41.000
You don't even have to look the way you do to grow on.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
You should grow a beard.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
That is uncomfortable, that face.

07:46.000 --> 07:51.000
That is the face of someone who is proud of their race.

07:51.000 --> 07:55.000
And he also has straight up like W.C. Fields gin blossoms.

07:55.000 --> 08:00.000
His eyes are like, they're like welling with blood tears.

08:00.000 --> 08:06.000
It's like the nerdy version of the Casino Royale bad guy.

08:06.000 --> 08:11.000
Like he just has a blood stigmatism in both eyes.

08:11.000 --> 08:15.000
He's a terrible writer, he's a terrible person.

08:15.000 --> 08:20.000
And we got to get him out because he's going to fucking kill me.

08:20.000 --> 08:24.000
I thought you were going to say, we got to get him on the show.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
You saw the thing, I retweeted it.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
And you guys hang on my every tweet.

08:29.000 --> 08:33.000
And you re-hang on my every retweet.

08:33.000 --> 08:37.000
He wrote a movie treatment.

08:37.000 --> 08:41.000
He wanted to be, you know, he's like a hack that got a piece of Seinfeld somehow.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
He's got points in Seinfeld.

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
He used to be in Hollywood before all of this happened.

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
Yeah, I think that's what gets my goat is that Trump and Bannon,

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
they both kind of represent the things I hate most about myself.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
Like other people are like, Trump reminds me of my dad.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
I'm like, my dad is way cooler than Donald Trump.

08:57.000 --> 09:01.000
Like it's me, it's like who is this remind me of when Donald Trump tweets.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
It's like, oh, it's me, it's me.

09:03.000 --> 09:07.000
It's like all the things that make him a bad person.

09:07.000 --> 09:11.000
But anyways, but Steve Bannon reminds me of the bad writer part of me.

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
Like there was some treatment that surfaced.

09:14.000 --> 09:22.000
It's documentary style, of course, because hack, hackenstein.

09:22.000 --> 09:27.000
There's like no narrative butt, nuts at all.

09:27.000 --> 09:32.000
No narrative butts about, no narrative butts, no cuts, no narrative coconuts.

09:32.000 --> 09:42.000
Push the structural button, pull the dialogue chain out, come chocolate, poo poo train.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
Shoot your train.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
All right, anyways.

09:46.000 --> 09:51.000
There's a treatment and it's like, and he refers to Islamic fascism,

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
but he spells it facism.

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
What's the deal with this face?

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
Is that like a thing that was that like a British thing?

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
Because too many people are worried about facism.

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
Wait, are you telling me you can spell it that way?

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
I don't know, that's what I want to know.

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
It's so delicious that he just never looked up the word fascism.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
Too many people are doing it, and I don't know.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
I haven't bothered to look it up.

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
Has anyone seen it spelled facism in the audience?

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
I mean, is that like they spell favorite with a U?

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
That's what I'm wondering.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
I don't think so.

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
I believe that many people are stupid, but it's just striking.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
I don't understand, well, I don't know.

10:29.000 --> 10:34.000
My favorite new thing is like all the like armchair electronic forensics

10:34.000 --> 10:38.000
that go on like when Trump, when the sheet left off the,

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
it said that there was like the phone log of all the leaders Trump talked to,

10:41.000 --> 10:45.000
and then it was like, president of Mexico, talk to him, president of whatever,

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
president, president of whatever.

10:47.000 --> 10:52.000
And then it was like, it just said, talk to Australia or something like that.

10:52.000 --> 10:56.000
And it didn't have the guy's name and it was, or did it say president of Australia

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
and then left it like that?

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
They did, at some point they had president there, yeah.

10:59.000 --> 11:04.000
But they, yeah, somebody said like, oh, if you Google president in Australia,

11:04.000 --> 11:09.000
there's no Wikipedia or Google hit that comes up, so they just left it blank.

11:09.000 --> 11:13.000
I'm like, oh my God, I love the backtracking and realizing like what,

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
like that with unprecedented too.

11:16.000 --> 11:21.000
I did the same thing, I typed in unprecedented and something came up that,

11:21.000 --> 11:26.000
I can't remember, I remember you can realize like you can walk in the shoes

11:26.000 --> 11:31.000
of stupid people and go like, oh my God, that's what happened

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
and they're running everything and it's amazing.

11:34.000 --> 11:39.000
But it's, you know, yeah, yeah, you know, we're, it's getting normal.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
We're normalizing, right?

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
That's what we're supposed to do.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
No, it's getting totally normal.

11:44.000 --> 11:48.000
Is there a William Ralph or Ralph William here in the crowd?

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
Woo! Is there?

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
Were your grandparents born here?

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
Get the fuck out!

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
Because we've got a new segment for our show!

11:58.000 --> 12:04.000
Why did you want Ralph Lorenzo?

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
Is it William C. Ralph or Ralph C. William?

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
William C. Ralph.

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
Did you drop a credit card by any chance?

12:11.000 --> 12:17.000
Well, I'm thinking you must, it's almost a guarantee now.

12:17.000 --> 12:21.000
Would you happen to know the last two digits of it?

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
Seven.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
Seven.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
Nope.

12:24.000 --> 12:28.000
Is that Ralph, Ralph, Ralph Lorenzo's worst nemesis?

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
Like he's always trying to fool you.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
And then Ralph or William, I have your card up here, you dropped it.

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
So if you want to come up and show me some idea, I'll give it back to you.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
Nice.

12:37.000 --> 12:46.000
Or I keep it, or I just announce, you have ten seconds before I read the entire four, eight,

12:46.000 --> 12:50.000
eleven, that's not even.

12:50.000 --> 12:54.000
Alright, Ralph is at the podium, he's showing the idea.

12:54.000 --> 12:59.000
I like that we have like two-factor authentication here.

12:59.000 --> 13:02.000
We had a guy lying to get on stage in San Francisco.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
I don't trust these fuckers anymore.

13:04.000 --> 13:08.000
What was the guy's name, Zane? That guy was a busy chef.

13:08.000 --> 13:17.000
When he came up on stage, I missed the fact that he said to Dan and to the audience that

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
he had lied about being a Trump supporter to get on stage.

13:20.000 --> 13:27.000
I'm so happy I didn't hear him say that, because I would have summarily thrown him out of the building.

13:27.000 --> 13:37.000
His suicide thing notwithstanding, I still would have made a point of telling him to fuck straight off into the night.

13:37.000 --> 13:41.000
You can't just lie to get up on stage.

13:41.000 --> 13:46.000
We would prefer you did not do that.

13:46.000 --> 13:53.000
I feel bad to make this guy show me ID to give him his credit card back, because I don't know what world we live in anymore.

13:53.000 --> 14:01.000
That might have been Adam Goldberg wearing high heels to get up here and take this guy's credit card.

14:01.000 --> 14:09.000
Oh, Adam, you're here? Oh, you son of a bitch. Adam Goldberg, everybody!

14:09.000 --> 14:19.000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
Well, that...

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
Is that the mad word?

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
That didn't...

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
No one to blame but yourself.

14:24.000 --> 14:29.000
I just... I just beatled you up on stage.

14:29.000 --> 14:34.000
He's three times more deadly than Beetlejuice.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
Jesus Christ.

14:36.000 --> 14:39.000
Why is it so terrifying that you're here of all times?

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
As the Patriots won.

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
And now you fucking, you New England asshole.

14:44.000 --> 14:47.000
The Overdogs won and it feels so good.

14:47.000 --> 14:50.000
I've been a Fairweather fan for 15 years.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
I've watched a lot of Super Bowls.

14:52.000 --> 14:56.000
I'm gonna hit your music cues so quick your head's gonna spin.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
He has a music cue?

14:58.000 --> 15:03.000
I'm gonna play a musical sting to get him off the stage at any moment.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
I accept that dammit, please.

15:05.000 --> 15:08.000
Let's reconnect, Adam. What's been going on with you since we last met?

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
I started a company. It's doing really well.

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
And I'm trying to start a political action committee with Spencer.

15:14.000 --> 15:20.000
He started DMing me about a political action committee.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
You responded.

15:22.000 --> 15:25.000
Oh, wait, no!

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
This is about as far as we got.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
I think this is more than we've talked about.

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
I think what he's saying is essentially technically accurate.

15:32.000 --> 15:35.000
You guys are in direct contact with each other.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
And it is an ongoing channel of communication.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
We did talk about a thing.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
We've elevated it now.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
What's your philosophy about political action?

15:43.000 --> 15:46.000
I mean, a lot of people, any port in a storm.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
If you got ideas, I want to hear them.

15:48.000 --> 15:52.000
I love that the America's premier Nazi is saying,

15:52.000 --> 15:57.000
oh, it's white people who did it while the four catches were done by a Jewish guy in the end zone.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
Like, are Jews white?

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
Did you just ignore my question?

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
That's my political...

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
You're just like, anyways, fuck off.

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
So here's my first bit.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
You didn't even hear me.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
I'm one of the hardcore people.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
I went to a symposium on the letter from a Birmingham jail,

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
so I do have a nuanced opinion on this.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
But I do believe you should...

16:19.000 --> 16:23.000
I've always respected about you, Adam, as your nuance.

16:23.000 --> 16:28.000
We all agree you can punch Nazis.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
When they go low...

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
Whether that's helpful or not.

16:32.000 --> 16:35.000
When they go low, you stomp on their Nazi skulls.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
But that's not your committee's...

16:37.000 --> 16:40.000
That's not what we're raising money for.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
Can I punch up your slogan?

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
When they go low, we go hiya!

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
Mr. Jeff.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
That bought me another 40-second censure.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
He wants...

16:51.000 --> 16:54.000
Jeff, he wants you in on this, by the way.

16:54.000 --> 16:57.000
Count me...

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
In.

16:59.000 --> 17:02.000
You're the political party animal.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
Oh, yeah.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
What's my...

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
What would my task be?

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
Shmoosin'.

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
I'm halfway there.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
Jeff and I are officially patriots now.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
We're men of political action.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
We're going to use our weight privilege to help.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
I'm a falcon.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
Well, then, I'm wearing...

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
I outrank you. I'm a patriot.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
Boo! I thought I'd get booze for that.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
Patriots like the football team.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
Patriots, Falcons like the football team.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
Essentially the same joke Jeff was doing.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
Oh, you're right.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
Dude!

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
What is your action committee...

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
Wait, no, I can't stomp that.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
Robert Kraft gave me that hat.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
The names you drop hit the floor...

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
Like a...

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
Like a...

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
Like a tarantula that's eating too much rice.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
Like a...

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
Like a tarantula that's notoriously explode

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
if they fall from higher than three feet.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
They hit the ground like a Tom Brady pass

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
in the first half of the year.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
The...

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
It's important...

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
We're coming into an age now.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
There's this ground swell of political action,

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
which is fantastic, but with that comes

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
like anxiety about like,

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
okay, so now how do you tell

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
the brave souls that are

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
right-minded, that are going to make

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
good coordinators and whose cause is worth

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
congealing around

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
from the people that are just like,

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
Get ya hot dogs! Get ya

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
political action here!

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
Got a t-shirt with a phrase on it

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
and all the money goes to our meetings

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
and we're going to hang out and talk about action!

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
I want to tell everyone here

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
that there is a lot to do in your local community.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
We see L.A.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
as like this liberal bastion,

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
but we still, in California,

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
incarcerate more people than any other state.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
We still have people being fined

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
and arrested for being late to public school

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
and we still have a lot of work that we can do here.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
So yours is a local...

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
You want to focus on the local...

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
There's a swing district up in Palmdale

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
that we can turn to

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
a Democratic seat, but...

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
This is singing a tune that early on

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
in the early apocalypse, kind of like

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
doing kind of days.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
This was the guiding light, although the really hard

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
to digest one,

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
because it just takes so much work,

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
but it's the idea of political parties

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
going back to being political parties

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
making Democrats be

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
in your local neighborhood

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
the reason why the burnt church gets repainted,

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
the reason why you have a blanket,

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
the reason why whatever

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
whatever shit goes down

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
have a...

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
even if it's a sub-faction of Democrats

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
talking about third-party stuff

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
which just feels like a fucking self-defeating thing

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
as a conversation, not as a solution,

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
but just as a conversation.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
There are two parties and we have to work to...

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
We now know that those parties mean nothing.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
We know that those parties are because

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
one was hacked and one almost splintered

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
and got beaten by the hacked one.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
So that's actually

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
quote-unquote good news, is that the bipartisan system

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
actually got functionally jailbroken.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
It got...

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
I think that can be a really good thing

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
because the Democratic Party could actually be

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
simply as the Republican one was

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
it's ready to be thrown.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
And I think it's a primitive thing

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
to think about, oh, where's my

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
big strong hero leader

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
that's gonna represent

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
all these things like if the Democrats now could

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
rise up as the Borg Cube that they are

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
and take over the Democratic Party

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
as a Borg Cube and say, no,

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
we're the fucking Democrats. We represent the majority.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
You can't beat us.

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
We're a fucking credit union, politically.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
We've got experts on the ecology.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
We've got experts on equality, blah, blah, blah.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
Yeah, we have to technically

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
have a presidential candidate, but

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
they're nothing.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
They're a civil servant.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
We tested them like an astronaut

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
to see if they could

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
legalize abortion in zero gravity.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
And...

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
It makes aftercare easier for the procedure.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
But anyways, anyways,

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
I'm jumping...

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
But that sounds like a good start.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
I'm glad you're thinking about local stuff.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
That seems like a good idea.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
If that could shoot spores out

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
to other districts that are

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
maybe technically red because of

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
10 people or 20...

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
And then take those over with action

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
that's just like, well, I'll be darned.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
These people care.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
They're not just playing a game of chess

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
against a red team.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
I would make the point that the idea

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
is that made the Democratic Party so

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
formidable between, I'd say,

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
1920 and 1960

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
were ideas that America

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
is still interested in. The idea of

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
fair wages for fair work, the idea of

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
environmental protection, the idea of

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
strong banking laws that protect the little people.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
But this goes back to an idea

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
you've always had, and when I explain it to lift drivers

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
because those poor people...

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
I always go back to your quote.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
That's step four of the plan.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
Step four is the lift driver.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
Talk to your lift driver. It works.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
They are all woke.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
But it goes back to your idea that power

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
corrupts not when you have it, but because

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
you want it. And in the

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
70s, a lot of people came in after

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
Watergate and said, all government is corrupt.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
We need to get rid of everyone who's been here

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
more than 10 years. A lot of those people got

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
kicked out were people who fought big banks

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
during the Great Depression.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
So you can overclean

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
house. You can get rid of allies because

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
they don't agree with you on all issues.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
There are some things we shouldn't

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
collaborate on.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
There are some things we should stand firm on.

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
But there's a great

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
number of people who want to hear our message.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
There are a great number of people who

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
haven't heard the message but would be

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
amenable. And there's a great amount of people

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
who not didn't vote because they didn't care

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
but didn't vote because they couldn't leave work

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
or whose votes weren't counted or

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
weren't able to see themselves

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
in the process after what's happening to them.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
They're neoliberalism.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
These people... This is the first time

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
you've ever gotten applause.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
Four years of our show.

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
I did once in Adam versus Spencer, I think.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
Spencer, what is your relationship with

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
Adam in this whole thing?

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
When did you guys become one of your dams?

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
As we said, he DMed me about

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
this idea.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
Yeah. And now he's here.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
I would have typed it out more

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
but I've been having carpal tunnel issues.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
My question is, if I didn't accidentally...

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
I didn't know that you were here tonight. If I didn't

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
accidentally conjure your name up, would you

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
still have made your way on stage tonight, wouldn't you?

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
You would have found a way.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
The dark magics are powerful.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
This is adult Adam.

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
We gotta remember, our podcast has been going on

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
for like five years.

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
Adam's like 28 now.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
Yeah.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
He's growing.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
No, I've had a curse of this, but a lot of it was

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
me being a lowly underemployed Hollywood person.

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
He's like, if I could get a writer's shop on community

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
all my problems would be solved

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
and I would be likable.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
It wasn't the case.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
Yeah.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
That was your angle in the beginning?

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
You can get the top writing job at

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
community and go forever unlikable.

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
There's no likeability.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
Why don't you just hire him right now

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
as head writer on community?

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
Finally, I can say

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
yes, I am Adam F. Goldberg.

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
I did produce it.

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
Adam, for those of us that did

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
smatter that applause and

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
you're thinking locally

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
and what could be more foolproof

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
because even if it turns out

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
to not be the way

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
to turn the whole world the other

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
direction, you still

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
as a loser will have

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
helped the world

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
that's real around you.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
I am adding my smatter to

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
that smatter applause.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
I appreciate that.

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
How do people that agree,

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
okay, I could use some direction

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
and something to do on Sunday or whatever.

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
How do we find your...

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
If you're hardcore into wanting to organize

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
other people, the SDS

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
is always trying to find new members

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
because we're Democratic socialists today.

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
Okay.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
Yeah.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
That's our cheer.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
We got to have a member of the Sioux Nation back there.

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
And remember what color Fat Albert

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
sweater was?

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
What were you yelling about, sir?

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
Oh, okay, okay.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
You're just yelling about Democratic socialists.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
That really what he was right, that's your cry.

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
Okay, that's your hua.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
Hey, hey, hey.

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
All right, so, but

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
your organization, you have nothing to plug yet.

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
No, no, okay, fine.

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
So we sign up to be socialists.

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
Just really, Milly.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
If you Google Democratic Party

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
or whatever party you're in, in your local area

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
you will find groups.

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
They're Facebook groups or meetup groups.

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
There's everything from picking up trash

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
on the side of the highway to, you know,

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
phone banking your senators.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
There's the, I think, 11 actions.

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
There's a movement to

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
have something that you can do every week

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
to help bring about the country that you want to see.

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
Okay.

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
Yeah, you can follow Adam Ultraberg on Twitter.

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
Eventually I will stop posting

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
about the Patriots, I promise.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
All right, well.

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
And the jokes will be just as good as these.

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
All right.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
Adam Goldberg, everybody.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
Adam Goldberg.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
It's a whole new world, Jeff.

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
We're through the looking glass, man.

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
Yeah, I just, Adam Goldberg did

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
a victory dance off the stage. It was good.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
The president's at war with

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
Arnold Schwarzenegger's ratings, even though it's

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
a show he runs.

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
That's it.

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
Pay attention to that, by the way.

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
Bad business, man. Just makes bad business decisions.

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
I mean, say what you want,

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
but you got to say that he's a man of faith.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
Yeah, no.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
He's a true Christian hero.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
He was praying for those ratings.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
You know, yeah.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
But also, yeah, I mean, congratulations

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
if you're a four-channer

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
that wanted to hack the government

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
and get this guy elected, like he's

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
a flavor of Mountain Dew

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
that you could make Hitler.

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
Very funny bit,

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
but now the guy

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
going to bring about the end of

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
net neutrality has been put in the, you know,

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
whatever. He's got his

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
chairman in charge of vice assistant

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
cybernetting or, you know,

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
is some guy that just fucking hates net neutrality.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
What is net neutrality? I don't know.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
I know it's

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
better than non-net neutrality.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
I know that the end of net neutrality

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
has something to do with a world where

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
you and I can have political opinions

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
and no matter how popular they would get

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
in an open idea

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
marketplace, they might be fucking

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
absolutely inaccessible

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
by virtue of the

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
Walgreens or, you know,

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
Netflix next door to you cybernetically

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
that just needs more fucking data.

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
Like, you poor people will no longer

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
be able to

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
spread as much information

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
as

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
corporations, and that is a really, really slippery slope.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
Net neutrality.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
Donald Trump clearly, obviously not a fan of it.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
He's not if you asked him. He'd be like,

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
what does that mean? Does it make my scalp

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
smaller?

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
Is it something I can grab,

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
rape, beat,

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
make fun of?

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
Was my dad

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
afraid of it? Would the ghost of my father

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
mock me while he punches the ghost of my

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
wife at the foot of my

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
bed?

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
Because if it doesn't fit into

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
those slots in my

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
gradually micro-stroking 75

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
year old brain,

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
I don't know what you're talking about, so he

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
puts some guy that knows a lot about computers

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
in charge of all computers in the world,

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
and so, good job

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
4chan.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
Which I think is on the internet.

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
The place where you got together

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
and elected this guy.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
I'm worried that if he stays in an office

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
long enough,

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
the world's tie fabric

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
resources will be depleted

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
probably in like, in six months.

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
His tie really

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
goes down to the tip of his

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
mangled dick.

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
His assuredly mangled

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
dick.

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
Absolutely. His wife won't

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
live with him in the white

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
house.

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
Like, it's the best house!

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
Like, how fucking repellent,

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
and repugnant, and bad in bed,

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
and disappointing of a fucking human male

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
do you have to be? For your wife to go

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
ehhhhh.

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
I don't want to live in the world's

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
most famous house.

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
I'd rather live in our shitty apartment

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
building surrounded by a fucking police state.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
Ehhhhh.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
He's so fucked up, we have to pay for

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
his wife not wanting to fuck him.

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
Ah, Jeff.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
I didn't, I didn't, I didn't read about

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
any of that. But, oh, also,

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
apparently

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
the tax payer, because she wants to live at the Trump Tower,

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
she's gonna live in a golden building, and it

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
costs the tax payers

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
$100,000 a day

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
for her police detail to

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
make her live at home, not

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
at home, at the white house.

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
She doesn't want to be

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
around this fucking piece of garbage.

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
You saw them dancing, and it was a bummer.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
When he started singing my way,

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
well, he clearly was saying things

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
right, and she was like, oh, please,

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
please, just stop it.

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
Just, just, just, just,

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
just, just, she's just saying to herself,

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
just get through whatever

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
contractual period I'm, like,

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
confined to. I, I, as church

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
said, like, my god, she's like, she's like, he

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
didn't expect to win. She thought they were gonna

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
lose and she would divorce him. Now she's stuck

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
with this piece of shit. Well, this is

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
his third wife, right? Third?

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
At least, right? That we know about.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
Third? The, wasn't the,

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
the first one was an American

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
model, right? Like, Mar- Mar- Mar- Mar- Mar-

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
wasn't there a second middle one that was,

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
and, and, and she was sort of,

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
I don't want to, I don't want to use this

30:47.000 --> 30:49.880
want to use this term disparagingly to somebody that I really don't know or if

30:49.880 --> 30:53.160
this is offensive term but she was essentially a male order bride right

30:53.160 --> 30:57.680
like like like she was a few she was also a like a Russian model or what or

30:57.680 --> 31:06.600
what was if I don't trump first then Marla yeah wait so so so wait so who's

31:06.600 --> 31:11.080
the I get confused because who this is his third wife yes okay so this is his

31:11.080 --> 31:15.080
third wife it's his second non-American wife and I'm not going where you think

31:15.080 --> 31:20.000
I'm going I'm not like Alex Jones going like no wait a minute I just mean I'm

31:20.000 --> 31:24.080
just talking sexually I'm talking about psychosexual politics I'm talking about

31:24.080 --> 31:31.040
like okay so first you have like a woman from your own country that you know it

31:31.040 --> 31:36.640
just was born within the same sort of you know glass ceilings aside the same

31:36.640 --> 31:41.040
sort of sandbox you were in with the same rules and things then she's gone

31:41.040 --> 31:46.200
she's out of there then like Howard Hughes in the aviator it's like you know

31:46.200 --> 31:50.000
Catherine Hepburn takes a hike and then you cut to the airplane hangar scene

31:50.000 --> 31:54.040
where Howard Hughes is like bringing underage girls in and going like stop

31:54.040 --> 31:57.240
right there 300 meters away you understand you'll be an employee

31:57.240 --> 32:01.320
contracted to me and you'll do what I say okay turn around alright wipe that

32:01.320 --> 32:04.160
lipstick off and stuff you know that scene in the aviator come on it's your

32:04.160 --> 32:09.120
favorite movie right you've watched it 75 times because you have some perverse

32:09.120 --> 32:14.000
fantasy of being America's most famous mentally ill entrepreneur because it

32:14.000 --> 32:20.480
reminds you of yourself like I said and so I thought like like what that's how

32:20.480 --> 32:27.280
we found Spencer but so you have that scene like and maybe ladies cover your

32:27.280 --> 32:30.640
ears I don't know what's gonna offend you here but I would say don't I would

32:30.640 --> 32:35.440
say I would say hit record when I say when I say cover your ears I just mean

32:35.440 --> 32:39.680
like don't judge like I for a second if you will if I be candid for a second

32:39.680 --> 32:45.520
like guys do like like we go through ups and downs and we do like like when we

32:45.520 --> 32:50.440
get our hearts broken we I think there is a tendency like to like we have these

32:50.440 --> 32:53.240
like things we do especially when we're young and we're still learning how to

32:53.240 --> 32:57.400
interact with people but go like we swing the other way you know like like

32:57.400 --> 33:00.280
like like from whatever previous relationship like we think we're gonna

33:00.280 --> 33:03.600
fix things and I'm sure this is not totally exclusive to men but I'm just

33:03.600 --> 33:07.560
talking to the guys because guys are kind of inherently you know we're

33:07.560 --> 33:13.000
misogynistic we're inherently we love slash fear slash worship slash hate

33:13.000 --> 33:17.560
despise these these these other creatures that we have so much power over us

33:17.560 --> 33:20.600
that we don't understand we just want them to like us blah blah blah makes us

33:20.600 --> 33:24.080
behave in all these fucked up ways we've been socialized not to share those

33:24.080 --> 33:28.800
feelings cope with them connect those to the feelings that are also fucked up

33:28.800 --> 33:31.440
with the other person and achieve that you don't start learning that stuff until

33:31.440 --> 33:37.200
you're 44 and rich and already divorced and are like finally opening the hood a

33:37.200 --> 33:42.040
little more than two inches on the fucked up car that is your life so you

33:42.040 --> 33:47.040
you keep me this very general forever for all man this is stuff you need time

33:47.040 --> 33:51.440
and money in the inclination to examine and I don't blame your average 40 year

33:51.440 --> 33:56.280
old guy that has a lot more work to do for not getting there wait this is a

33:56.280 --> 33:59.680
tangent I'm just saying here's here's what I'm saying in the crassist terms I'm

33:59.680 --> 34:05.040
like if your first wife was like just like it was an American model and then

34:05.040 --> 34:09.520
your second wife was a Russian model and then your third wife was a Russian model

34:09.520 --> 34:15.520
here's what I'm assuming about the third marriage there's preconditions up the

34:15.520 --> 34:21.240
fucking darkest yin yang imaginable like because there's no other difference he

34:21.240 --> 34:26.400
didn't didn't go to French model he didn't go to Japanese model like he went

34:26.400 --> 34:32.320
he was like I like me those those those eastern block women and here's another

34:32.320 --> 34:36.240
one I'm guaranteeing you there's some fucked up differences at the outset of

34:36.240 --> 34:39.960
that relationship that result in those that face that she's making that that

34:39.960 --> 34:42.720
broke your heart because you said oh yeah minded you of what you do at the

34:42.720 --> 34:51.200
Apple store right Spencer said that's the face of a customer service rep so what

34:51.200 --> 34:54.040
you know you do that you know you're smiling and they turn around and you're

34:54.040 --> 35:04.240
like she's a hostage is the worst yeah anyways I mean I mean benefit of the

35:04.240 --> 35:07.040
doubt I'm hoping that she doesn't want to live with Donald Trump because he's a

35:07.040 --> 35:11.680
gross perverted asshole and she wants to take care of Baron like you know like

35:11.680 --> 35:17.520
maybe he needs special care or whatever and she doesn't want to do huh like I

35:17.520 --> 35:21.440
mean maybe she's an awesome mom who doesn't want to be involved in that

35:21.440 --> 35:25.720
circus like I'm hoping that that's the case but one thing's for certain she

35:25.720 --> 35:31.160
doesn't want to be around him and now we have to foot the goddamn bill and we

35:31.160 --> 35:35.360
have to be around him I know it's like we're the we're the we're the most

35:35.360 --> 35:41.080
victimized neighbor in the world to that fucked up relationship like the care

35:41.080 --> 35:52.480
taker at the Overlook Hotel had it better Scatman Crothers dad he had a name

35:52.480 --> 35:59.480
the the okay so okay so here's the thing so go ahead cap capitalist what do you

35:59.480 --> 36:06.440
call it uh what do you call it activism consumer activism all right so uber we

36:06.440 --> 36:12.240
fucking the people spoke with their money and then he quit and then he he

36:12.240 --> 36:15.440
pulled out of the thing that was egregiously like like oh I love Trump

36:15.440 --> 36:20.480
and I think maybe issued a statement that kind of disavowed he said I didn't

36:20.480 --> 36:24.000
want this to be about politics it's wanted to be about being part of the

36:24.000 --> 36:27.640
thing and it hurt his bottom line and he and he fucked straight so the

36:27.640 --> 36:30.160
question is now I'm having a disagreement with Cody about this because

36:30.160 --> 36:35.400
she's like oh you can reinstall uber now and I was like wait fuck him now

36:35.400 --> 36:41.120
off of this head like he'll be fine anyway like let him just drive all

36:41.120 --> 36:46.520
Republicans around but but and I'll see you with the finish line but he was

36:46.520 --> 36:49.600
already but but but she's got a point too though if you're if you if we

36:49.600 --> 36:53.720
actually want to if it's about you know it's not it's just about swatting and

36:53.720 --> 36:56.600
I don't know it's like a very interesting argument she's like oh you can take an

36:56.600 --> 37:02.640
uber now because he he got hit and acknowledged he got hit publicly and

37:02.640 --> 37:07.520
and and kowtowed to the will of the people what you don't want to do is

37:07.520 --> 37:12.440
continue to just grind his face into the dirt he I mean like I I don't want to

37:12.440 --> 37:15.840
say things and be fake news about this but like it hasn't already been like a

37:15.840 --> 37:20.000
lot of like mistreatment of his workers I would say we should have stopped

37:20.000 --> 37:25.160
using uber well before this because there's loads of sexual assault charges

37:25.160 --> 37:32.960
right his workers are really ill-treated guys really high-roaded me well no I mean

37:32.960 --> 37:37.400
though because I just like being able to tip because I'm just like now I can

37:37.400 --> 37:41.720
give him however many stars I want yeah yeah because I'm paying here's the weird

37:41.720 --> 37:45.120
thing about lift though that I know that I've switched and I'm not gonna go back

37:45.120 --> 37:48.800
I'm I've learned to cope with lift and and it's not as it's not as bad as it

37:48.800 --> 37:54.240
was when I stopped using it yeah but it's like the form I just I'm never gonna

37:54.240 --> 37:59.680
give you less than five stars unless you like like run my dog or something but if

37:59.680 --> 38:02.920
you give less than five stars if you press left those five stars before you

38:02.920 --> 38:08.640
submit it says how can how can Rashida improve and but if you give five stars

38:08.640 --> 38:12.120
as tonight you know Rashida drove me here in a lift and then it you give five

38:12.120 --> 38:17.280
stars and it always then it says like what did you love about about Rashida

38:17.280 --> 38:21.920
I've never had that feedback thing like it's right there I mean do you not know

38:21.920 --> 38:25.560
like I've only given less than five stars maybe two or three times ever and I

38:25.560 --> 38:28.520
take lift all the time when I'm saying when you give five stars the question

38:28.520 --> 38:32.200
changes from what would you improve to what did you love I'm saying I've never

38:32.200 --> 38:36.400
gotten that feedback loop thing we're like work they've never asked me tell

38:36.400 --> 38:39.320
me why you gave five stars or tell me why you didn't I've never seen that they

38:39.320 --> 38:44.440
probably don't care about it yeah motherfucker it sounds like I don't

38:44.440 --> 38:50.400
social anxiety feature because yeah my point is like what do you tell me does

38:50.400 --> 38:55.000
anybody ever type anything like I start I was flirting with ironic things like

38:55.000 --> 38:59.680
like like like like the stars in his eyes or like like but but I don't want to

38:59.680 --> 39:04.320
confuse people I've never been asked to weigh in on why I've only said that you

39:04.320 --> 39:07.680
get to rate them and that's the end of the franchise all right well to tell you

39:07.680 --> 39:11.680
the truth I thought that was gonna be a half hour of the show was talking about

39:11.680 --> 39:17.680
that but now we're fucked it appears that's a dead-ass Thomas see howl here I

39:17.680 --> 39:24.480
have your credit card see how the actor I guess I have a load of credit cards up

39:24.480 --> 39:30.160
here that people I think he's been killed by Rucker Howard Rucker Howard god

39:30.160 --> 39:34.880
damn it Harmon fucking get your shit together see you I I can never keep

39:34.880 --> 39:37.920
track of whether you are with the Apple watch or against the Apple watch well

39:37.920 --> 39:41.600
I'm trying it again tonight it's just it's because I had so few notes I've

39:41.600 --> 39:44.840
thought well I'll just put them on my watch instead of like we fucking hot

39:44.840 --> 39:48.760
don't you wear your Apple watch like Rip Taylor decides to wear his toupee

39:48.760 --> 39:53.280
sometimes yes sometimes now second where it's like a hat you decide to wear

39:53.280 --> 40:03.080
sometimes talk to each other what are blue I can't freebio where can he be

40:03.080 --> 40:08.000
where can he be so another brings us the technology corner you have the theme

40:08.000 --> 40:22.120

40:22.120 --> 40:41.600

43:49.160 --> 44:01.520
look you only look like a complete douchebag he can't hear us he's lost in

44:01.520 --> 44:05.440
the groove I love music but I would rather never

44:05.440 --> 44:11.960
hit music again than be caught wearing those fucking carry on my way words there's

44:11.960 --> 44:16.480
just so much that wires offer in headphones what keeps it keeps them from

44:16.480 --> 44:19.960
falling out of your ear holes well the same thing that always did your ears

44:19.960 --> 44:23.560
they're wedged in your ears but they never fell out they haven't fallen out

44:23.560 --> 44:26.400
since 2010 they changed the shape they wedged in their ears like a little

44:26.400 --> 44:30.800
arrow if you drop one you're out of hold god damn I don't wear I don't wear

44:30.800 --> 44:35.440
those because I lost so much hearing because of those we'll get to that in

44:35.440 --> 44:40.120
a second wait there was so oh the only thing I don't like about these I thought

44:40.120 --> 44:43.800
I was comfortable with like Ray Kurzweil's singularity you know like I'm

44:43.800 --> 44:48.000
ready to become a part of the part of the computer world but then these things

44:48.000 --> 44:53.280
they know when they're in your ear and I was like I'm out nope when you put them

44:53.280 --> 44:58.120
in they go they make that like that activation sound of like a blue tooth

44:58.120 --> 45:04.240
device I'm like why do you know you're in my ear what are you measuring light

45:04.240 --> 45:10.920
wax spider eggs yeah I was like why don't they go when you put them in your

45:10.920 --> 45:15.920
pocket like like white but maybe they do we can't hear them they just listen to

45:15.920 --> 45:20.240
your balls the whole day long they listen I thought they're supposed to put

45:20.240 --> 45:25.080
sound in your balls that's what they want you to think with the whole time

45:25.080 --> 45:30.560
haha well I don't know jury's out on them I think they got little cups can you

45:30.560 --> 45:35.880
talk into them as you know I don't know there's a bunch of sperm in there I've

45:35.880 --> 45:40.200
done I've done phone calls with them but I don't know where my sound is going

45:40.200 --> 45:44.000
it you know Steve wanted to know I think these are microphones down on the end

45:44.000 --> 45:48.920
that's cool Steve said that like there is some new data about the new iPhone

45:48.920 --> 45:55.120

45:55.120 --> 46:05.280
ears is that George Michael was you wow too soon I know yeah hey I soon we know

called paying tribute I love George Michael I was a huge philanthropist and

46:25.040 --> 46:29.720
he was an awesome dude I pay tribute you marked his death you yank effect one of

46:29.720 --> 46:32.760
his signs and incorporated his death into one of his signs that's there's

46:32.760 --> 46:35.720
difference it's like those SNLs we can update jokes where they'd be like the

46:35.720 --> 46:41.080
creator of the Oreo died on Wednesday and his casket was buried between two

46:41.080 --> 46:45.680

tell people I bought a gun we can talk we could talk about you bought a gun you

52:22.280 --> 52:26.000
bought a gun we could talk about why did you buy a gun because you secretly

52:26.000 --> 52:31.640
want to kill somebody it's the only reason I secretly know that in the event

52:31.640 --> 52:36.640
that you're hoping for that event to happen so you could kill something that's

52:36.640 --> 52:41.360
not your secret Charles Bronson you see I've discussed this with my therapist

52:41.360 --> 52:47.920
and I have a right to buy a gun she said as long as you're it's not for you and

52:47.920 --> 52:51.760
it's not for anyone in the immediate future well never starts out like that

52:51.760 --> 52:58.440
no but in all fairness dance therapist is Sam Peckin Park

53:00.080 --> 53:04.120
what we landed we didn't talk about this because it in between San Francisco

53:04.120 --> 53:09.360
which was our last show and now we we flew in from San Francisco to LAX and

53:09.360 --> 53:12.880
it was like the airport was deserted because the protests had just started

53:12.880 --> 53:17.600
and we spent like five and a half hours Jeff was there longer church showed up

53:17.600 --> 53:21.280
to take pictures but we were we were just there in the midst of this historical

53:21.280 --> 53:26.480
thing I'd never been at a protest and I thought it was like I mean it was it was

53:26.480 --> 53:29.120
amazing I hate to sound like some weird tourists but that's literally what we

53:29.120 --> 53:34.320
were we had luggage and Jeff Jeff had his Vivian Westwood suits over his shoulder

53:34.320 --> 53:39.400
and his Newsy cap and his fancy jacket and and he kept he kept like he was

53:39.400 --> 53:42.800
able to just go up to the cops and find out what's going on like like hey what's

53:42.800 --> 53:45.360
going on and they're like just protecting people's right to free speech you

53:45.360 --> 53:50.240
know it was a very it was a very after you guys left we had an agreement with

53:50.240 --> 53:54.440
the police that we were like we got there we were blocking all of the traffic

53:54.440 --> 53:58.440
for when we got to like you know probably six hours after it started we got

53:58.440 --> 54:04.240
there like around five or six o'clock it had been going on all day and we were

54:04.240 --> 54:08.040
blocking everything and then finally the police came in giant force all these

54:08.040 --> 54:13.560
cops came and if you felt if you follow a church on like Instagram or Facebook

54:13.560 --> 54:19.760
whatever she's amazing photos of all these cops came and then they but

54:19.760 --> 54:23.480
the cops came from the direction that we weren't facing so you can very quickly

54:23.480 --> 54:28.880
go from texting tweeting about how you're at our at a protest and you're so

54:28.880 --> 54:32.680
cool because you're at a protest like huh looks like looks like people are

54:32.680 --> 54:38.040
protesting and they're chanting and here I am I'm I'm I'm just 60 minutes back

54:38.040 --> 54:42.680
here just and then and then there's lights flashing because it's a concourse

54:42.680 --> 54:47.080
and then everyone turns around here everyone's facing my direction now

54:47.080 --> 54:53.800
okay phone away and just staring at riot shields like six feet away and then

54:53.800 --> 54:56.760
look at doing a double-take of realizing the guy next to me is wearing a

54:56.760 --> 55:00.520
football helmet and the homemade I took a picture with him and tweeted it but it

55:00.520 --> 55:05.440
was like I did a double-take of that guy I was like hey hi and he's like her a

55:05.440 --> 55:13.080
little Rick and Morty and it was just like holy fuck that guy with a homemade

55:13.080 --> 55:16.080
gas mask and the whole thing yeah yeah Rick and Morty fan yeah there were a

55:16.080 --> 55:21.400
lot of why was it homemade why is he got a home he has a football helmet he had

55:21.400 --> 55:26.000
like a like a lacrosse helmet on with a with a like a home he had a riot shield

55:26.000 --> 55:30.560
like saw that no no he had he had a he had a gas mask like a kind of a it was

55:30.560 --> 55:33.440
it was it was a mask yeah I think you get a home depot for painting I think if

55:33.440 --> 55:40.640
you work in like these are police no this was another guy that was

55:40.640 --> 55:48.280
protesting why is he got a thing on his face he's anticipating activity that may

55:48.280 --> 55:52.800
involve him breathing tear gas or getting hit with a baton how do you

55:52.800 --> 55:56.840
understand that he complimented you if he had a gas mask on that was my joke

55:56.840 --> 56:03.600
if it was very muffled over good morning so he didn't say it he did it's a

56:03.600 --> 56:09.400
popular show you might as I'm not saying it is I said it's 740 most of the people

56:09.400 --> 56:13.200
were like where's season three I was like get back to protecting democracy

56:13.200 --> 56:17.240
for it was it sounds I that was the only thing that called me as those kids are

56:17.240 --> 56:22.600
fucking like really into my cartoon like like I don't know how to tell them my

56:22.600 --> 56:26.840
heart is pounding in my chest like I'm like I'm like relocating my phone to

56:26.840 --> 56:29.520
different pockets I'm like I think there's a bottle cap down here could

56:29.520 --> 56:35.880
that cut my arterial like arteries which are the best kind of arteries classic

56:35.880 --> 56:42.320
the classic arterial artery it says every the new arterial artery it's

56:42.320 --> 56:48.640
order arterial all right don't use a venal artery you were looking for a

56:48.640 --> 56:54.440
bottle cap in your pocket I was like struggling like I'm like freaking out

56:54.440 --> 56:57.320
because I'm thinking I'm gonna get arrested for the first time I'm gonna

56:57.320 --> 57:02.920
get manhandled by people that aren't my family for the first time I'm gonna I'm

57:02.920 --> 57:07.240

57:33.240 --> 57:40.480
time for the season three Rick and Morty update wrap you want to wrap hang on

57:40.480 --> 57:46.000
second give me a second have you been Dan talk about things have you been Dan

57:46.000 --> 58:05.440
I haven't seen you in a while I've been good what's going they're drawing here's

58:05.440 --> 58:14.360
how cartoons work first you write them then you draw them for a really long

58:14.360 --> 58:27.560
time everything needs to be on paper so you can see it so if all I do is write

58:27.560 --> 58:44.320
it and then put it on TV it'll look like a script instead of Rick and Morty what

58:44.320 --> 58:59.600
you seem to like and when you tell me to stop being political and get back to

58:59.600 --> 59:09.640
drawing it I don't try it I know it looks like I do that's called style those

59:09.640 --> 59:33.400
artists are still actually to go to school they're drawing it and they'll

59:33.400 --> 59:40.680
be drawing it until they're done drawing it and then adult swimmel cheers

59:40.680 --> 59:58.000
when the air it's very much not my decision when the air things because

59:58.000 --> 01:00:17.320
remember because I don't control other things are on TV or not if I did we'd

01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:24.160
be in season 9 of community and it would be 48 episodes a year and they would

01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:32.680
also just be shows about me taking a shit I would I would be every show I would

01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:37.760
because I don't I'm gonna stop when you say stop I'm gonna fuck your mama like

01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:46.160
the head of a mop a hip hop to the hip one day Superman team down he said I'm

01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:55.280
Superman so comparatively you're a clown I said ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

01:00:55.280 --> 01:01:02.400
Superman got his woofers and tweeters out I said motherfucker democracy is gonna

01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:13.640
chout with your titties out around about I got the gout Superman ain't too much

01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:21.640
rich food, heavy creams and sauces. He thought he was impervious to them because he's Superman.

01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:30.640
A lot of people don't know. Totally normal internal digestive system. He can succumb to things like gout.

01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:34.640
A lot of people say gout is Superman's kryptonite.

01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:49.640
From a strictly dietary standpoint, however, gout can never actually kill him because he's...

01:01:49.640 --> 01:02:05.640
They're drawing it.

01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:21.640
While they're drawing it, I'm making a million things and they take a long time to make. Spencer's killing it on Harmon Quest Season 2.

01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:38.640
I thought for a second that there was a little bit of it that was going to be bad. I wouldn't set him up by saying that.

01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:43.640
I'm so excited about Harmon Quest. I'm not saying... There's nothing... Don't let that show up in an article where it's like,

01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:51.640
here's why Rick and Morty's late. Dan's excited about Harmon Quest. It's not related. They're drawing it. They have to draw the things.

01:02:51.640 --> 01:03:01.640
I will say and did say. The reason it was late, the reason they got a late start drawing it is because I am fucking slow and shitty and unpredictable as a writer.

01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:14.640
The buck stops here with that. I'm done with that part. You can't now tell me to go faster. It doesn't make any sense. I confessed to my crimes after it was too late to make me change.

01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:19.640
You're yelling at the audience. You're yelling at them.

01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:32.640
Anyways, it's 9-11 probably. Is it 9-11? It looks like 9-10. Moment of silence for the bowling green massacre victims.

01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:43.640
Oh my God. Are you booing my mainstream political jokes?

01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:53.640
I could have stopped it. Do you have any actual political jokes? Let's do a Dan Harmon joke corner where you tell a joke.

01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:59.640
It doesn't have to be political. Any just proper joke joke.

01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:01.640
Oh, I thought it was a political joke.

01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:03.640
Oh, if you got one, lay it on us.

01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:17.640
Kelly and Conway walks into a chamber. That's how all good jokes start.

01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:23.640
And there's a vortex in it.

01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:32.640
A door to the south.

01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:39.640
And there's other people in there. She wants to save them because they're Nazis or something.

01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:50.640
And so she says, I'll tell you what, you guys run and I'll put the vortex where my soul should be.

01:04:50.640 --> 01:05:01.640
And they say, but how will you keep your physical form from desiccating in this really on the nose evil way?

01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:07.640
How will you keep yourself from looking like an over the top sorceress?

01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:24.640
As if there's like weird permanent mascara tears going down the lines where your veins supply blood to your eyeballs from a heart that may just be a black rock that glows and pulses rather than beating.

01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:28.640
And she's like, I don't know. I'll just deal with it.

01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:34.640
And they run, all the Nazis run, and they're like, yay, we're free. We made it out of that chamber where there was a vortex.

01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:37.640
And she's like, I made it too.

01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:38.640
And they're like, but you...

01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:45.640
By the way, if you guys have heard this, you can stop them at any time.

01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:50.640
No, but I don't have any political jokes.

01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:54.640
I didn't mean to stop you.

01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:59.640
It's really hard not to make fun of Kelly in Conway's appearance because you, but it's like, it's like one of those weird...

01:05:59.640 --> 01:06:01.640
She looks like the lead singer of Hannai Rocks.

01:06:01.640 --> 01:06:06.640
It's a catch-22 because you're like, you know what? Part of this is you want to be woke, you want to be on the right team.

01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:09.640
It's like, we want to live in a world where you're...

01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:13.640
So you're using tools that the enemy uses to just go like, oh, she's an ugly woman.

01:06:13.640 --> 01:06:16.640
Like, well, that's not really the point. It's just more like she looks evil.

01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:23.640
Yeah. No, the president of the United States, fat and feminine, everything possible, shamed everybody.

01:06:23.640 --> 01:06:28.640
We're allowed to say he has a giant ass and she looks like the lead singer of Hannai Rocks.

01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:31.640
Yeah. But you can hear it's not going over well.

01:06:31.640 --> 01:06:35.640
Because they don't look... Just look up the lead singer of Hannai Rocks.

01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:40.640
It's like picture pages, like there's supplemental material to our entertainment.

01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:47.640
There was this thing called picture pages starring a man that turned out to be a famous rapist.

01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:51.640
He was so famous for rape.

01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:54.640
Well, I'm saying he turned out he ended up a famous...

01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:56.640
More famous for that than pudding.

01:06:56.640 --> 01:06:57.640
Yeah.

01:06:57.640 --> 01:06:59.640
You got to admit.

01:06:59.640 --> 01:07:00.640
Yeah.

01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:06.640
He's the second-least-powerful rapist in America right now.

01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:10.640
Who's the least-powerful rapist in America?

01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:12.640
Second-most, I meant.

01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:13.640
Oh, okay. There we go.

01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:15.640
Let's check in with Spencer and see what's going on in China.

01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:19.640
Hey, guys. I got these pickles.

01:07:19.640 --> 01:07:21.640
We can't carry on.

01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:22.640
Why did you bring pickles?

01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:23.640
They're great.

01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:24.640
Where did you get the pickles?

01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:26.640
From Artisan Cheese Gallery.

01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:28.640
Spencer's into pickles now.

01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:32.640
Hey, go to Baller Hardware. They sell pickles at the hardware store.

01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:33.640
No, they don't.

01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:36.640
They sell pickles at the hardware store, and I went,

01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:39.640
why are you selling pickles at the hardware store?

01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:42.640
And they said, because they're fucking good, man.

01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:46.640
Baller Hardware, let me try some of these pickles.

01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:51.640
And I finished the jar. They're good, man.

01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:52.640
That sounds great.

01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:54.640
You got to get these pickles, man.

01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:58.640
Are they their own brand of pickles, the hardware store people?

01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:01.640
No.

01:08:01.640 --> 01:08:04.640
They're just name brand pickles, and they stock?

01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:06.640
No, they're not name brand.

01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:11.640
I guess they're made in Silver Lake by a friend of the guy who owns the hardware store.

01:08:11.640 --> 01:08:12.640
Oh, that's awesome.

01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:15.640
So I can go get some keys made by some light bulbs.

01:08:15.640 --> 01:08:16.640
Get some pickles.

01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:17.640
Get some pickles.

01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:18.640
Get some pickles.

01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:19.640
This sounds like one-stop shopping.

01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:20.640
And leave.

01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:25.640
Yeah, they got the small baby pickles, and then they got the larger ones, too.

01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:26.640
So you really are...

01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:29.640
I get one of each.

01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:32.640
Spencer, can I try one of your pickles?

01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:35.640
Yeah, they're in the back. I bet Steve could bring them up.

01:08:35.640 --> 01:08:36.640
Can you bring out these pickles?

01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:38.640
Steve, would you bring out the goddamn pickles?

01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:43.640
You really are getting into home improvement, which is funny, because when I got fired from community,

01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:45.640
I started hanging shelves and shit.

01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:49.640
It was like some weird impulse, and are we allowed to talk about the fact?

01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:51.640
Well, it's all over the place, if I know what you're talking about.

01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:55.640
Your relationship with Lego has reached a conclusion, and now you're putting up shelves.

01:08:55.640 --> 01:08:57.640
That's what I did after community.

01:08:57.640 --> 01:09:04.640
I had a lot of errands that I've been putting off, and I had to leave Lego to put up some shelves.

01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:06.640
Do my laundry. What do we got here?

01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:08.640
There's ones that are peppers and ones that are pickles.

01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:09.640
Oh, these are fucking delicious.

01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:11.640
Right. They're so good.

01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:12.640
Did you just eat a pepper or a pickle?

01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:14.640
I think that was a pickle one he grabbed.

01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:15.640
Give me some of them.

01:09:15.640 --> 01:09:17.640
That's a pickle. It's almost like a bread and butter pickle.

01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:18.640
Give me some of them.

01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:19.640
Yeah, it's the only thing that's a sweet pickle.

01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:20.640
Give me some of them.

01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:21.640
Oh, God, I'm joy.

01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:23.640
I mean, I would put that on a sandwich, or I just eat them.

01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:24.640
Oh.

01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:25.640
Right, you just eat them straight.

01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:26.640
They're great.

01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:28.640
I want to eat some of these pickles.

01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:32.640
All right. Is there anyone in the audience?

01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:33.640
They're spicy, too.

01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:34.640
Yeah, they're spicy, too.

01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:36.640
I want to eat some pickles.

01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:37.640
Get a pickle.

01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:39.640
People pay $10 for this show.

01:09:39.640 --> 01:09:40.640
Oh, my God.

01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:41.640
Pay $10.

01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:42.640
Waited in line.

01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:50.640
But right now, if you are a new subscriber to the live stream, your subscription fee goes to the ACLU.

01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:52.640
We match your donation.

01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:54.640
We don't send your money to the ACLU.

01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:56.640
We match your donation.

01:09:56.640 --> 01:09:57.640
I guess that's a legal thing.

01:09:57.640 --> 01:09:58.640
We match it.

01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:03.640
If you subscribe now to the live feed, we're going to match all of your money until the

01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:08.640
March, when we find out that Donald Trump is a bad person on the tax march.

01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:11.640
But we haven't found out if he's a bad person yet.

01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:14.640
We're going to hope to find that out one day.

01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:20.640
Is there anybody in the audience that, and since it's been kind of a sausage tea party

01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:21.640
up here.

01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:24.640
Thomas, see how.

01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:28.640
I will go with a lady's first rule, but I'm just more curious.

01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:33.640
Is there anybody in the audience that's kind of like, say, a veteran protester, somebody

01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:38.640
who's been at, like, more than, like, five protests?

01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:39.640
Nobody.

01:10:39.640 --> 01:10:40.640
Wow.

01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:41.640
Four protests.

01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:42.640
Well, that's important to know, too.

01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:44.640
Like, we're all, I mean, you guys are like me.

01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:49.640
Like, we've entered new times where, like, lower the number.

01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:53.640
What about a woman that was, uh, women here that were at the woman's march?

01:10:53.640 --> 01:10:54.640
Oh, you're just coming up.

01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:56.640
You didn't raise your hand, but you're, okay.

01:10:56.640 --> 01:10:57.640
No, no, it's fine.

01:10:57.640 --> 01:11:00.640
And you definitely, I don't, yeah, you look like a protester.

01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:01.640
Come on up.

01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:02.640
Uh, yeah.

01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:03.640
What's your name?

01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:04.640
Harry.

01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:05.640
Harry?

01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:06.640
Okay.

01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:07.640
It's Harry, everybody.

01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:08.640
Hey, everyone.

01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:10.640
Do you want a pickle?

01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:13.640
No, I actually really don't like pickles.

01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:14.640
I will take a.

01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:15.640
You'll love these pickles.

01:11:15.640 --> 01:11:18.640
These pickles are, these pickles are pretty good.

01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:21.640
Hey, cats, everyone thinks I'll love their cat.

01:11:21.640 --> 01:11:23.640
Everyone thinks I'll love their pickles.

01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:27.640
Well, everyone's cats are bad, but these pickles are good.

01:11:27.640 --> 01:11:30.640
So, Harry, these pickles are off the fucking deep end, Harry.

01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:32.640
Treat yourself to one of these pickles.

01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:34.640
I'm going to stick with no pickles.

01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:37.640
Take the pickle.

01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:39.640
I'm protesting these pickles.

01:11:39.640 --> 01:11:40.640
I'm protesting.

01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:45.640
Drink, drink, drink, drink, drink that dill juice.

01:11:45.640 --> 01:11:49.640
Harry, come on.

01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:51.640
You fucking pussy.

01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:53.640
Drink that dill juice, man.

01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:55.640
No, I mean, I'm definitely scared to drink that.

01:11:55.640 --> 01:11:56.640
No, drink it.

01:11:56.640 --> 01:11:57.640
Drink that dill juice.

01:11:57.640 --> 01:11:58.640
That dill juice.

01:11:58.640 --> 01:12:00.640
Fucking Harry, drink it.

01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:02.640
Fucking pussy, man.

01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:05.640
Harry's not drinking the dill juice.

01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:07.640
Drink that dill juice.

01:12:07.640 --> 01:12:09.640
No.

01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:10.640
All right.

01:12:10.640 --> 01:12:11.640
On the graph.

01:12:11.640 --> 01:12:12.640
On the graph.

01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:15.640
The amount of laughs toward time spent on this bit.

01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:20.640
We peaked, and now we're going to ride downhill into the next segment.

01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:21.640
Harry.

01:12:21.640 --> 01:12:22.640
Yes.

01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:24.640
So, it was my first protest.

01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:25.640
I had to be flown into it.

01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:26.640
I was also there.

01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:27.640
Were you there at the LAX?

01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:28.640
Yeah.

01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:30.640
When we shut that shit down?

01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:32.640
Arrivals and departures?

01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:34.640
I was also there like days prior and after.

01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:36.640
Fuck you, high road.

01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:38.640
No, this isn't for you, it's for them.

01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:39.640
You got off on an airplane.

01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:42.640
I was flown in with luggage.

01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:49.640
I was like, hell no, we won't go, not until my dog sitter is off duty.

01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:53.640
I don't know if it's because some get more attraction than others on social media,

01:12:53.640 --> 01:12:57.640
but people seem to arbitrarily choose when to go to things that are consistent.

01:12:57.640 --> 01:13:01.640
The Women's March was a set thing that happened at a time on a day.

01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:05.640
LAX was like, we kind of need you here always because there's planes keep coming in

01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:07.640
and people keep being detained.

01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:11.640
If you're trying to be there to just be a physical body of support,

01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:14.640
that's always needed until this shit changes.

01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:19.640
Well, I'm going to skip over a topic that'll make me babble for too long

01:13:19.640 --> 01:13:23.640
and put my foot in my mouth, which is to hold the pin.

01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:27.640
I want to get back to this topic after the next one,

01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:33.640
which is white people need to go to protest more than other people.

01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:39.640
White people sitting at their keyboard at home are doing three times as much

01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:44.640
by not doing anything because society is unfair.

01:13:44.640 --> 01:13:48.640
I said I wouldn't talk about it, but put a pin in that.

01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:50.640
White people need to go to more protest.

01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:53.640
Put a pin in it, Harry!

01:13:53.640 --> 01:13:57.640
And move that pin in accordance with the LAPD's wishes every five minutes.

01:13:57.640 --> 01:13:59.640
That's my next topic.

01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:03.640
I'm going to eat a fucking pickle.

01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:06.640
Obviously, the LAPD is more experienced than any protestor out there.

01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:09.640
As an organization, maybe not the actual cool cucumbers,

01:14:09.640 --> 01:14:14.640
the very ethnically diverse cool cucumbers they put out on the front lines.

01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:19.640
As human beings, I got to say, the first thing that hits your mind

01:14:19.640 --> 01:14:24.640
as a first-time protestor being there, I was like, I love these protestors

01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:28.640
and I love the LAPD. It was this weird thing.

01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:33.640
But then throughout the evening, by the time I got home, I was like, oh, we got played.

01:14:33.640 --> 01:14:36.640
It's like, oh, peaceful protest, peaceful protest.

01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:38.640
Everyone was so proud of how peaceful the protest was.

01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:43.640
Well, the protest was peaceful because the protest was run by the LAPD.

01:14:43.640 --> 01:14:46.640
And every time somebody started chanting, fuck the police,

01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:50.640
everybody would go like, peaceful protest, peaceful protest.

01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:53.640
We wouldn't want anyone to get arrested, tear gassed, all these things.

01:14:53.640 --> 01:14:59.640
But it's really tough because basically the protestors ended up making a deal with the LAPD.

01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:02.640
They were in constant contact with them, which I thought was a glorious thing.

01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:04.640
There is a positivity to that, right?

01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:10.640
There is a positive message that that sends, especially when the cops aren't the ones holding the detainees.

01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:12.640
I know you're asking, you're going like, damn, what is your question?

01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:13.640
No, not at all.

01:15:13.640 --> 01:15:16.640
But the LAPD isn't in charge of the detainees.

01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:23.640
And so they're working with them, cooperating with them.

01:15:23.640 --> 01:15:26.640
It actually does provide these spine-tingling opportunities to be like,

01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:29.640
hey, maybe you guys should be over here too.

01:15:29.640 --> 01:15:33.640
You are all like a rainbow of people descended from, you know,

01:15:33.640 --> 01:15:36.640
whose family tree goes up two feet without an immigrant in it.

01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:39.640
You're just wearing riot gear because that's your job.

01:15:39.640 --> 01:15:40.640
Like, get over here.

01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:42.640
And it's like, there's some moments where it was like, they might do it.

01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:47.640
I saw an airport cop, technically not LAPD. I forget the exact distinctions there.

01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:51.640
But he cried when one of the detainees got released.

01:15:51.640 --> 01:15:54.640
And then I called him on it and he quickly got really macho about it and like wiped his tears out.

01:15:54.640 --> 01:15:57.640
Church took some, Jeff's girlfriend took some great pictures of,

01:15:57.640 --> 01:16:01.640
she could just be church, it doesn't have to be Jeff's girlfriend.

01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:05.640
What a fucking horrible society this is.

01:16:05.640 --> 01:16:07.640
She loves pickles.

01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:11.640
She got there too late in the game to like, if she had been there,

01:16:11.640 --> 01:16:12.640
she's an amazing photographer.

01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:17.640
Like, nothing makes you realize more than photos,

01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:21.640
like the history that we're living and you see it because it looks like Time Magazine.

01:16:21.640 --> 01:16:22.640
Let's bring church up.

01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:23.640
She's sitting right here.

01:16:23.640 --> 01:16:28.640
Church over at Cassandra Church.

01:16:28.640 --> 01:16:33.640
The pictures that you took of that young lady who had like,

01:16:33.640 --> 01:16:38.640
she decided to focus her emotional energy on one cop as if that itself were a weapon,

01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:41.640
like a quote-unquote weapon, it's not destructive.

01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:46.640
She was just, that was probably both a tactic and a very sincere thing

01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:48.640
because she was unmistakably sincere.

01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:50.640
And the cop, you said, well, you describe it.

01:16:50.640 --> 01:16:52.640
Well, it was when I first got there.

01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:56.640
And as you say, you know, they were in the street for a little while

01:16:56.640 --> 01:16:58.640
and then bringing people back up onto the sidewalk.

01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:03.640
And at this point, this is when all the police started pushing everybody back up onto the sidewalk.

01:17:03.640 --> 01:17:08.640
And this one particular girl caught my eye because as a photographer,

01:17:08.640 --> 01:17:13.640
I pushed my way to the front to try to get a view of everyone facing the police.

01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:18.640
And this one girl was just glued on this guy.

01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:21.640
And she had just tears, like, rolling down her face.

01:17:21.640 --> 01:17:28.640
And her sign said, like, Syria, Yemen, Iran, welcome here with a heart.

01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:32.640
She was sobbing and sobbing and sobbing.

01:17:32.640 --> 01:17:35.640
And she was leaning off the curb practically onto an officer

01:17:35.640 --> 01:17:38.640
who just kind of, like, leaned back and acted like I wasn't doing it

01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:41.640
because he could see what I saw and what I was trying to photograph.

01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:42.640
They were being very nice to photographers.

01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:44.640
They were being incredibly nice to photographers.

01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:47.640
At one point, I was on an overpass looking down at these guys

01:17:47.640 --> 01:17:52.640
and they were smiling and waving and laughing and taking photos of me with their phones.

01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:54.640
And then they were all just on Instagram.

01:17:54.640 --> 01:17:56.640
They were hanging out. They were fine.

01:17:56.640 --> 01:17:58.640
There was absolutely no problem.

01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:02.640
I couldn't hear what was being said between the girl and the officer in front of her,

01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:06.640
but he was whispering to her and trying to calm her down.

01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:12.640
And they were having some conversation that I couldn't hear from where I was standing.

01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:14.640
But he seemed to be consoling her.

01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:19.640
Right. She was pleading something with him and trying to get him to understand

01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:21.640
and from what I could tell by their gestures.

01:18:21.640 --> 01:18:23.640
Probably something along the lines of, I'm just doing my job.

01:18:23.640 --> 01:18:26.640
Right. And he's probably saying something like, I know I understand and I'm just doing my job.

01:18:26.640 --> 01:18:28.640
Like, okay, just stay back on the curb.

01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:33.640
And that could be the most important interaction that you have with police

01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:35.640
is getting them to admit that they're just doing their job,

01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:39.640
reminding them of that the whole time because that means they don't have to be mad.

01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:43.640
They don't have to be, but on the flip side of that,

01:18:43.640 --> 01:18:47.640
so that's why I wanted to have a hanky face as now I call them.

01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:50.640
Because I was like looking around like, these hanky faces,

01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:54.640
are the hankies for anonymity or tear gas?

01:18:54.640 --> 01:18:57.640
People have their own reasons for them.

01:18:57.640 --> 01:18:58.640
So a lot of us just...

01:18:58.640 --> 01:19:04.640
There's also an argument, I can't defend it for various reasons or like object it to it.

01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:09.640
There's some articles going around about how like masking up is a form of white privilege

01:19:09.640 --> 01:19:12.640
because if you're a white person then you still blend into the crowd

01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:17.640
whereas like if there's only a few people of color at the thing, they're easier to identify.

01:19:17.640 --> 01:19:19.640
I didn't even follow, I didn't track that at all.

01:19:19.640 --> 01:19:23.640
It's just some 2017 internet race commentary.

01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:27.640
I would say at this age, I think there's probably, it's rooted like masking up is probably...

01:19:27.640 --> 01:19:29.640
It's rooted in anonymity.

01:19:29.640 --> 01:19:30.640
Okay, okay.

01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:32.640
Because it's not going to filter out.

01:19:32.640 --> 01:19:33.640
No, not at all.

01:19:33.640 --> 01:19:35.640
Certain things will, like the Home Depot guy who I also saw,

01:19:35.640 --> 01:19:38.640
like his would have helped out a bit.

01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:43.640
But yeah, I mean if they throw tear gas, your sunglasses and fabric aren't going to do shit.

01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:47.640
So before church got there, this is what happened,

01:19:47.640 --> 01:19:50.640
which I think this could be a microcosm of what we're all facing,

01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:53.640
if we're all going to be protesting and marching, it's like this is a really difficult thing.

01:19:53.640 --> 01:19:55.640
Because there was an exhilaration in the air,

01:19:55.640 --> 01:19:59.640
and part of the pride on the part of the protesters was in no uncertain terms

01:19:59.640 --> 01:20:03.640
the fact that we were working in what you have to call cooperation with the LAPD.

01:20:03.640 --> 01:20:05.640
That felt like a triumph.

01:20:05.640 --> 01:20:09.640
Now you're dealing with a police department that has been at a million of these.

01:20:09.640 --> 01:20:13.640
And they, and so, and you, but on the other hand,

01:20:13.640 --> 01:20:17.640
all of these individual police officers are human beings as are the protesters.

01:20:17.640 --> 01:20:23.640
But when I get home and I see basically that the protest got successfully broken up, you know,

01:20:23.640 --> 01:20:27.640
and I look back and it was like there was this moment where we were all standing

01:20:27.640 --> 01:20:33.640
and blocking the upper concourse, and one of the megaphone people said,

01:20:33.640 --> 01:20:39.640
you know, here's the deal, the cops are saying so far we haven't broken the law.

01:20:39.640 --> 01:20:42.640
Because they haven't issued a disperse order.

01:20:42.640 --> 01:20:45.640
When they issue a disperse order, we have a decision to make.

01:20:45.640 --> 01:20:50.640
Are we going to become criminals and turn this into a thing

01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:55.640
that's going to end up being a news item about how we were criminals

01:20:55.640 --> 01:20:57.640
and how the crime had to be put down?

01:20:57.640 --> 01:21:01.640
Alternatively, they've offered us a deal.

01:21:01.640 --> 01:21:09.640
They've said that we can stand on the sidewalk for 15 minutes or 30 minutes

01:21:09.640 --> 01:21:13.640
and then disrupt for 10 minutes and then do that in alternation.

01:21:13.640 --> 01:21:22.640
And there was a pause and then someone called out, 15, 15 minutes, 20, 20, 15

01:21:22.640 --> 01:21:29.640
and it turned to the price is right about how we got the nuts here.

01:21:29.640 --> 01:21:32.640
I'm not disparaging that.

01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:34.640
I'm just pointing out the absurdity of it.

01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:40.640
It's not because what happened was a wedge got driven in between the people

01:21:40.640 --> 01:21:48.640
that have done this before and were not necessarily hoping things would deteriorate

01:21:48.640 --> 01:21:52.640
but at the same time probably that were prepared for it.

01:21:52.640 --> 01:21:55.640
And that's always going to be a smaller group.

01:21:55.640 --> 01:21:59.640
And so that was a really, that is a tactic, right?

01:21:59.640 --> 01:22:03.640
Because they, rather than bother throwing tear gas at a large group of people

01:22:03.640 --> 01:22:07.640
that feel solidified to stay in communication with them

01:22:07.640 --> 01:22:10.640
and to say, oh, we love Shayguvara.

01:22:10.640 --> 01:22:12.640
Shayguvara is your spokesman.

01:22:12.640 --> 01:22:13.640
We just talked to Shayguvara.

01:22:13.640 --> 01:22:15.640
Shay, tell your people what we're telling them.

01:22:15.640 --> 01:22:19.640
We're telling you, you can have free bananas if you give us half of your guns.

01:22:19.640 --> 01:22:26.640
And then there's like, all of this stuff starts, you foment like a conversation among the protesters.

01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:28.640
Before that, there was no conversation.

01:22:28.640 --> 01:22:34.640
I feel like there were a couple of things that made that specific.

01:22:34.640 --> 01:22:40.640
One, it was, like church, you were at the Ferguson protests here in LA.

01:22:40.640 --> 01:22:42.640
Yeah, and it was a very different thing.

01:22:42.640 --> 01:22:47.640
If it was 2000 black people at the airport, I think it would have been different.

01:22:47.640 --> 01:22:50.640
And also, if it weren't an airport, it would have been different.

01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:56.640
They don't want to start putting chemical agents out into an airport.

01:22:56.640 --> 01:22:58.640
But all that is to say that we had the leverage.

01:22:58.640 --> 01:22:59.640
We had the airport shut down.

01:22:59.640 --> 01:23:01.640
I don't know what our leverage translated to.

01:23:01.640 --> 01:23:04.640
But sorry, go ahead, Harry.

01:23:04.640 --> 01:23:07.640
There's also a difference between a protest like the Women's March where it's organized.

01:23:07.640 --> 01:23:08.640
It's in the daytime.

01:23:08.640 --> 01:23:11.640
They block off streets and everybody knows where it's going to be

01:23:11.640 --> 01:23:14.640
and where the people will be going generally and what the plan is.

01:23:14.640 --> 01:23:15.640
Right.

01:23:15.640 --> 01:23:19.640
Versus at night people just taking to the street because they're angry

01:23:19.640 --> 01:23:23.640
or people showing up to a place like the airport that already has high security.

01:23:23.640 --> 01:23:24.640
Okay, so Harry...

01:23:24.640 --> 01:23:28.640
So the reaction is completely different by a police force coming out to try to contain

01:23:28.640 --> 01:23:30.640
and make sure that that's under control.

01:23:30.640 --> 01:23:32.640
And where there's multiple law enforcement agencies.

01:23:32.640 --> 01:23:33.640
Right.

01:23:33.640 --> 01:23:35.640
What I'm wondering is then what was...

01:23:35.640 --> 01:23:38.640
Because what happened was there were some hardcore elements that were like,

01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:40.640
no, then nothing happens.

01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:41.640
This is how they drive a wedge.

01:23:41.640 --> 01:23:42.640
And then there were...

01:23:42.640 --> 01:23:44.640
Like, here I am, 44.

01:23:44.640 --> 01:23:45.640
I got...

01:23:45.640 --> 01:23:46.640
I'm hungry.

01:23:46.640 --> 01:23:48.640
My dogs are about to start pissing in the house.

01:23:48.640 --> 01:23:50.640
I've been there for five hours.

01:23:50.640 --> 01:23:52.640
Like, I didn't want...

01:23:52.640 --> 01:23:54.640
The last thing I wanted to do is be a pussy.

01:23:54.640 --> 01:23:55.640
But...

01:23:55.640 --> 01:23:57.640
You didn't see the girl who brought burritos?

01:23:57.640 --> 01:23:59.640
No, there was plenty of burritos.

01:23:59.640 --> 01:24:01.640
You left right before the burrito guy came out.

01:24:01.640 --> 01:24:03.640
She brought a bunch of fucking burritos.

01:24:03.640 --> 01:24:05.640
To the extent that I'm up in the air,

01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:09.640
like, a situation got created where now conversations are starting to happen.

01:24:09.640 --> 01:24:10.640
Like, logic was invited.

01:24:10.640 --> 01:24:18.640
And I remember distinctly the moment where I felt at peace with stepping off of the street

01:24:18.640 --> 01:24:21.640
and under the sidewalk, i.e. basically surrendering.

01:24:21.640 --> 01:24:24.640
The moment where I felt that that was okay,

01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:27.640
where I wouldn't then go home and hate myself for giving in,

01:24:27.640 --> 01:24:31.640
because there were, like, only a couple of people left who were arguing with each other.

01:24:31.640 --> 01:24:37.640
And one of them was screaming at the ones who wanted to stay and sit and get arrested.

01:24:37.640 --> 01:24:40.640
It's not about you!

01:24:40.640 --> 01:24:41.640
And she's not...

01:24:41.640 --> 01:24:43.640
There was this messaging that was put into it.

01:24:43.640 --> 01:24:47.640
It was like, do we want the detainees to be in the newspaper?

01:24:47.640 --> 01:24:48.640
Newspaper.

01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:49.640
Do it...

01:24:49.640 --> 01:24:50.640
Do whatever.

01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:54.640
The huff-posed laser beam, the hologram, the pokemons.

01:24:54.640 --> 01:24:57.640
Do we want the story to be about the detainees,

01:24:57.640 --> 01:25:01.640
or do we want it to be about how a bunch of hippies got stun gunned at the airport?

01:25:01.640 --> 01:25:02.640
Okay, so now...

01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:05.640
So at that moment, I was like, here...

01:25:05.640 --> 01:25:08.640
I've done all the talking, but I want to be...

01:25:08.640 --> 01:25:12.640
Like, here's the thing, first protest, 44 years old,

01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:15.640
like, so used to always doing the wrong thing.

01:25:15.640 --> 01:25:17.640
Like, I always, like, think that I'm like,

01:25:17.640 --> 01:25:21.640
oh, sounds like this, and then I'll be so embarrassed.

01:25:21.640 --> 01:25:24.640
That's when I was like, okay, I now have permission to step on the sidewalk

01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:27.640
because this very passionate young woman is going, like, it's not about you,

01:25:27.640 --> 01:25:29.640
and she's talking to, like, four or five people,

01:25:29.640 --> 01:25:35.640
and, like, I don't know, and I won't know until someone else tells me

01:25:35.640 --> 01:25:39.640
whether it's the right thing to do to sit here, sit down, or leave.

01:25:39.640 --> 01:25:43.640
I was like, what if I undercut the fucking cause?

01:25:43.640 --> 01:25:47.640
It was like, a community creator and famous fat guy.

01:25:47.640 --> 01:25:52.640
It's like, what if that ends up being some kind of counter-messaging or whatever.

01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:55.640
So now talk to me, tell me what to do.

01:25:55.640 --> 01:25:58.640
I think, well, sort of contrary to that request,

01:25:58.640 --> 01:26:02.640
I think it's important no matter which side of an issue you're on,

01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:06.640
not to tell other people protesting the same thing, how to protest,

01:26:06.640 --> 01:26:11.640
whether that means if someone wants to get arrested for their cause,

01:26:11.640 --> 01:26:13.640
let them make that decision.

01:26:13.640 --> 01:26:18.640
And if someone wants to chant a chant and hold a sign,

01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:20.640
let them make that decision.

01:26:20.640 --> 01:26:24.640
I think it's important to know what you're trying to accomplish

01:26:24.640 --> 01:26:29.640
and if what you're doing is everything you could be doing to accomplish that.

01:26:29.640 --> 01:26:36.640
So, like, if you want to make real change in government policy,

01:26:36.640 --> 01:26:41.640
holding a sign and chanting a chant isn't going to do that.

01:26:41.640 --> 01:26:45.640
Because they've now incorporated that into their system if they hadn't already 60 years ago.

01:26:45.640 --> 01:26:49.640
And it's just like, that's you being, by going to the airport,

01:26:49.640 --> 01:26:55.640
you're being a physical body supporting a message as well as actual people who are detained.

01:26:55.640 --> 01:27:02.640
But, like, if you have any illusions that what you're doing in that is really affecting larger change,

01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:05.640
which I think was one thing some people gave the women's march kind of a bad rep for this,

01:27:05.640 --> 01:27:08.640
but I thought it was cool that they almost owned up to, like,

01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:11.640
we don't have a list of demands, we just want to make sure you know we're here

01:27:11.640 --> 01:27:13.640
and we're not fucking cool with this stuff.

01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:15.640
Which I thought was so, that was the most important thing.

01:27:15.640 --> 01:27:16.640
You could look at it either way.

01:27:16.640 --> 01:27:19.640
It turned out body count was the thing that was important.

01:27:19.640 --> 01:27:24.640
It was flesh scraping cement poured into the streets of every city around the world.

01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:28.640
That really got to our enemy.

01:27:28.640 --> 01:27:34.640
So, like, if you go to a protest and the police give you a directive,

01:27:34.640 --> 01:27:38.640
it's basically just up to you to assess what it is you're trying to do

01:27:38.640 --> 01:27:43.640
and if listening to that directive or disobeying it is going to further your cause.

01:27:43.640 --> 01:27:48.640
So, like, if you're there just for moral support, maybe don't get arrested.

01:27:48.640 --> 01:27:49.640
Or do.

01:27:49.640 --> 01:27:53.640
Like, that's your choice, but it's not going to, if you get arrested,

01:27:53.640 --> 01:27:58.640
you're not going to be able to be the body there showing your support.

01:27:58.640 --> 01:28:04.640
So, what do you think? You were there, and so you were like, you know what, for what we've done,

01:28:04.640 --> 01:28:10.640
we shut down the airport, LAX is not the epicenter of this, the LAPD is not in charge.

01:28:10.640 --> 01:28:16.640
You thought it was cool to shrink back and continue to have a presence there.

01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:20.640
It's kind of a picket line in the sense that it's like a physical reminder.

01:28:20.640 --> 01:28:25.640
Yeah, it sort of becomes up to you also having been there for over a day already

01:28:25.640 --> 01:28:28.640
and to continue to be there. Like, those cops work long shifts.

01:28:28.640 --> 01:28:31.640
They come to recognize people who are there enough.

01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:36.640
If I'm going to continue to be there and do what I think is my best foot forward

01:28:36.640 --> 01:28:40.640
to help my cause or whatever, getting arrested doesn't help that.

01:28:40.640 --> 01:28:43.640
These cops recognize me already as the guy who's been here all week.

01:28:43.640 --> 01:28:47.640
Like, it's not useful for me to step to them. I know they're not the enemy.

01:28:47.640 --> 01:28:49.640
How much time have you spent out there at LAX?

01:28:49.640 --> 01:28:51.640
Like, you've been there for multiple days?

01:28:51.640 --> 01:28:54.640
Yeah, yeah. I haven't been in a couple of days because at a certain point

01:28:54.640 --> 01:28:56.640
I was like, oh, I need to make rent money.

01:28:56.640 --> 01:28:59.640
But I was there for like four or five days.

01:28:59.640 --> 01:29:02.640
Not sleeping there because I was like, I have a home to go to

01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:05.640
and I don't want to be more of a nuisance than by design.

01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:08.640
Well, I found a good tactic because we just got off a plane like Dan said.

01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:13.640
I had my suit, Vivienne Westwood's, that garment bag over my shoulder.

01:29:13.640 --> 01:29:18.640
And I'm dressed like me and there's a bunch of hippies.

01:29:18.640 --> 01:29:22.640
Harry, I know we all saw that dude that was kind of the Native American guy

01:29:22.640 --> 01:29:25.640
with a drum that was just being the most punk rock dude in the world.

01:29:25.640 --> 01:29:26.640
The tiny drum?

01:29:26.640 --> 01:29:27.640
Yeah.

01:29:27.640 --> 01:29:28.640
He was there a lot.

01:29:28.640 --> 01:29:31.640
There was this guy dressed up like just this native, like, like, Inkin,

01:29:31.640 --> 01:29:35.640
I don't know what he was, just banging a drum right in the cops' faces

01:29:35.640 --> 01:29:38.640
and they didn't, like, they just let him do it. It was so cool.

01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:40.640
Because, like, they don't give a shit.

01:29:40.640 --> 01:29:45.640
Yeah, because he was just this great, like, drum major for the whole thing.

01:29:45.640 --> 01:29:51.640
But there was a moment when the organizers of the protest at LAX were saying,

01:29:51.640 --> 01:29:54.640
okay, guys, are we need people upstairs and downstairs at the same time?

01:29:54.640 --> 01:29:58.640
So if you guys are comfortable going upstairs, we want to spread this out.

01:29:58.640 --> 01:30:00.640
Also, we need people inside to welcome the people coming out.

01:30:00.640 --> 01:30:02.640
So let's make sure that we're all here and we're all there.

01:30:02.640 --> 01:30:07.640
So, Church and I, I think Dan and Cody had just gone. You guys just split.

01:30:07.640 --> 01:30:10.640
And this is, like, oh, like, 10 p.m. and we got there, like, at five.

01:30:10.640 --> 01:30:15.640
We went downstairs and we had to, it was time to go back into the street

01:30:15.640 --> 01:30:19.640
and disrupt things with the cops so we can go and be disruptive for 15 minutes.

01:30:19.640 --> 01:30:24.640
And, like, we can be off the sidewalk and be out in traffic and walking.

01:30:24.640 --> 01:30:28.640
Your next schedule, disruption, will be permitted in T-miners.

01:30:28.640 --> 01:30:33.640
Right-wingers are roasting you online for listening to cops just so everyone's aware.

01:30:33.640 --> 01:30:36.640
Like, if you go and watch a right-wing chat room where they're, like, periscoping the protest,

01:30:36.640 --> 01:30:38.640
they're just like, look at these fucking idiots listening to police.

01:30:38.640 --> 01:30:40.640
Like, they don't know what they're doing.

01:30:40.640 --> 01:30:42.640
Really? The right-wing people say that?

01:30:42.640 --> 01:30:44.640
Yeah, because they're like, oh, you think you're making a change,

01:30:44.640 --> 01:30:47.640
but you're sitting here obeying cops, which I'm not.

01:30:47.640 --> 01:30:50.640
Also, because they don't know the difference between a protest and a riot.

01:30:50.640 --> 01:30:53.640
Yeah, yeah.

01:30:53.640 --> 01:30:59.640
Now, hilariously, while it was happening, like, every 30 minutes, because it's LAX,

01:30:59.640 --> 01:31:02.640
hello, I'm Mayor Eric Garcetti.

01:31:02.640 --> 01:31:06.640
While Eric Garcetti is not at the airport.

01:31:06.640 --> 01:31:10.640
It's really funny. There's, like, a guy painted blood red with a Native American drum

01:31:10.640 --> 01:31:12.640
in a cop's ear going, boom!

01:31:12.640 --> 01:31:17.640
But we, like, this is democracy! This is what democracy looks like!

01:31:17.640 --> 01:31:20.640
And then it's like, hello, I'm Eric Garcetti.

01:31:20.640 --> 01:31:23.640
Not a good time, Eric.

01:31:23.640 --> 01:31:29.640
So we were a small group of people going downstairs to block the downstairs traffic, too.

01:31:29.640 --> 01:31:32.640
And again, I feel bad about anybody that missed a plane or all that shit.

01:31:32.640 --> 01:31:35.640
It's a bummer. But we were trying, there was a lot of people being detained,

01:31:35.640 --> 01:31:40.640
and we were trying, we were hoping that, like, being there was going to get all these people released.

01:31:40.640 --> 01:31:45.640
But it turns out 25 did get released, and then during that time, 100 more people got detained.

01:31:45.640 --> 01:31:47.640
Complaints keep coming in.

01:31:47.640 --> 01:31:51.640
That's the central issue of what's going on at LAX that I think needs to be remembered.

01:31:51.640 --> 01:31:55.640
Like, yes, there's a bigger picture of, like, Trump's executive orders in the large scale

01:31:55.640 --> 01:31:57.640
and overall policies about immigration.

01:31:57.640 --> 01:32:01.640
But, like, specifically what's going on is people are being illegally detained

01:32:01.640 --> 01:32:04.640
and denied access to food, water, lawyers, family, like...

01:32:04.640 --> 01:32:06.640
Healthcare.

01:32:06.640 --> 01:32:08.640
That's what's happening.

01:32:08.640 --> 01:32:10.640
Elderly, it doesn't matter.

01:32:10.640 --> 01:32:12.640
Not even from just those seven countries.

01:32:12.640 --> 01:32:15.640
They detained an Aero Mexico flight of, like, 100 passengers.

01:32:15.640 --> 01:32:18.640
A woman from Amsterdam, like, they're just...

01:32:18.640 --> 01:32:20.640
CBP is being crazy.

01:32:20.640 --> 01:32:25.640
Like, if you're a privileged white guy that has access to a garment bag,

01:32:25.640 --> 01:32:27.640
here's a little tip.

01:32:27.640 --> 01:32:28.640
Go to a protest.

01:32:28.640 --> 01:32:30.640
Look like you just landed.

01:32:30.640 --> 01:32:34.640
Looks like you didn't show up to the protest, planning to be the protest.

01:32:34.640 --> 01:32:35.640
And have a garment bag.

01:32:35.640 --> 01:32:38.640
And you get to walk up to the police and talk to them,

01:32:38.640 --> 01:32:43.640
and they absolutely give you the full order of information that you don't get

01:32:43.640 --> 01:32:46.640
if you look like a protestor, because we all walked into the street

01:32:46.640 --> 01:32:53.640
and they all lined up, put their sticks up, their masks down on their helmet shields,

01:32:53.640 --> 01:32:56.640
and started marching us back off the street.

01:32:56.640 --> 01:32:59.640
And it's like, back on the curb, back on the sidewalk, back on the sidewalk.

01:32:59.640 --> 01:33:01.640
And they're like, we had a deal! We had a deal!

01:33:01.640 --> 01:33:03.640
And they're like, nope, you gotta get back on the street.

01:33:03.640 --> 01:33:07.640
So I just sort of, I went out of the crowd because I'm a tall privileged white guy

01:33:07.640 --> 01:33:08.640
with a garment bag.

01:33:08.640 --> 01:33:10.640
We had a deal! We had a deal!

01:33:10.640 --> 01:33:11.640
Chester's walking over.

01:33:11.640 --> 01:33:14.640
Honestly, all the men got off the street, all the women in the group

01:33:14.640 --> 01:33:17.640
stayed in this fucking street and were right the chin up to the cops.

01:33:17.640 --> 01:33:19.640
They're like, no, we had a fucking deal.

01:33:19.640 --> 01:33:21.640
And the cops are like, back on the street, back on the street.

01:33:21.640 --> 01:33:25.640
So I went down like Goldilocks and asked three different cops.

01:33:25.640 --> 01:33:30.640
Hey, I put my suit garment over my shoulder like I'm a Kerry Grant.

01:33:30.640 --> 01:33:33.640
You know, hey, hey, hey, hello, hello, matey.

01:33:33.640 --> 01:33:35.640
Do we change the deal? What's the difference now?

01:33:35.640 --> 01:33:37.640
We had a deal! We had a deal!

01:33:37.640 --> 01:33:39.640
And you guys are going back on the curb, sir.

01:33:39.640 --> 01:33:40.640
I want you to know the cop.

01:33:40.640 --> 01:33:41.640
Hey, I thought we had a deal.

01:33:41.640 --> 01:33:44.640
30 minutes on the sidewalk and 15 minutes in the road.

01:33:44.640 --> 01:33:47.640
And I wasn't really doing my bad Kerry Grant.

01:33:47.640 --> 01:33:49.640
You're really committing to it.

01:33:49.640 --> 01:33:53.640
But I was like, did things change? What's going on, man?

01:33:53.640 --> 01:33:56.640
I thought you told these kids there was a thing.

01:33:56.640 --> 01:33:59.640
And the second cop goes, now you gotta get back on the sidewalk, sir.

01:33:59.640 --> 01:34:01.640
All the way down to the very last cop.

01:34:01.640 --> 01:34:04.640
I said, hey, wasn't there a thing going on?

01:34:04.640 --> 01:34:06.640
Like where there was like, we could be on the thing for 30 minutes

01:34:06.640 --> 01:34:08.640
and be out in the street for 50 minutes.

01:34:08.640 --> 01:34:10.640
And the guy kind of paused and looked around.

01:34:10.640 --> 01:34:12.640
And he goes, you have to be in the sidewalk.

01:34:12.640 --> 01:34:13.640
The crosswalk.

01:34:13.640 --> 01:34:14.640
The crosswalk.

01:34:14.640 --> 01:34:15.640
We have to be on the crosswalk.

01:34:15.640 --> 01:34:18.640
And everyone, I ran back to the group.

01:34:18.640 --> 01:34:20.640
We had a deal! We had a deal!

01:34:20.640 --> 01:34:21.640
Everybody! Everybody!

01:34:21.640 --> 01:34:22.640
We had a deal!

01:34:22.640 --> 01:34:23.640
Over to the crosswalk!

01:34:23.640 --> 01:34:24.640
Crosswalk!

01:34:24.640 --> 01:34:25.640
Go to the crosswalk!

01:34:25.640 --> 01:34:26.640
Go to the crosswalk!

01:34:26.640 --> 01:34:30.640
And the cops, the LAPD, stood on both sides of the crosswalk

01:34:30.640 --> 01:34:32.640
and protected us and let us do our thing for a while.

01:34:32.640 --> 01:34:37.640
So I couldn't believe at an airport how nice they were being about that deal.

01:34:37.640 --> 01:34:39.640
Because I think it was because it's an airport.

01:34:39.640 --> 01:34:42.640
They don't want to start shit when it doesn't need to be.

01:34:42.640 --> 01:34:46.640
They weren't going to throw tear gas anywhere near the door to LA.

01:34:46.640 --> 01:34:47.640
Exactly.

01:34:47.640 --> 01:34:50.640
Well, and I hope, and I think our hearts were filled with hope

01:34:50.640 --> 01:34:54.640
and perhaps naively perhaps were being laughed at for having this hope

01:34:54.640 --> 01:34:59.640
that it's the LAPD, their jobs to serve and protect the people of Los Angeles,

01:34:59.640 --> 01:35:02.640
these people, children of immigrants, immigrants themselves,

01:35:02.640 --> 01:35:05.640
descending on this international hub of commerce,

01:35:05.640 --> 01:35:09.640
because LA fucking pumps and thrives with immigrant energy, foreign blood,

01:35:09.640 --> 01:35:13.640
that's America, that all of those cops, also as civil servants,

01:35:13.640 --> 01:35:16.640
are like, I am here to protect your freedom of speech.

01:35:16.640 --> 01:35:20.640
I think we all felt that high of like, the cops are being chill right now

01:35:20.640 --> 01:35:23.640
because they know we're right and they want us to win.

01:35:23.640 --> 01:35:27.640
And that allowed us to make deals with them and get high off of that.

01:35:27.640 --> 01:35:29.640
Oh, the teacher put an apple on my desk.

01:35:29.640 --> 01:35:37.640
I think, so I, one thing that's really important is that this sea of,

01:35:37.640 --> 01:35:45.640
there's like 150 people in this room and this is a scientific, important statement,

01:35:45.640 --> 01:35:49.640
not a shaming one, that absolutely nobody here yet,

01:35:49.640 --> 01:35:55.640
this is like my predominantly white audience and certainly all of them,

01:35:55.640 --> 01:36:00.640
regardless of gender background, whatever, they're all nerds.

01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:04.640
They're all like analytical thinkers and we've all been guilty of this

01:36:04.640 --> 01:36:08.640
where we sit and we're watching what's happening and you don't want to side

01:36:08.640 --> 01:36:12.640
with a dirty, belligerent hippie anymore than you want to side with a fascist cop.

01:36:12.640 --> 01:36:15.640
Like you, your instinct, because you are like me,

01:36:15.640 --> 01:36:18.640
like you're like, you want to be Han Solo, he's the smart one,

01:36:18.640 --> 01:36:21.640
he's the logical one, you were an individualist.

01:36:21.640 --> 01:36:26.640
Like you, that's your American values, that's the way you express how you are.

01:36:26.640 --> 01:36:29.640
You don't want to, you don't see any merit in joining a throng.

01:36:29.640 --> 01:36:31.640
What good could come of that?

01:36:31.640 --> 01:36:36.640
And I don't want to ever tell you what to do and I'm proud of the fact

01:36:36.640 --> 01:36:39.640
that my audience has never protested.

01:36:39.640 --> 01:36:45.640
But like, I'm now saying like, because this time is crucial, I'm 44,

01:36:45.640 --> 01:36:51.640
and if you're 25, you may have been a child when the dangling Chad election happened

01:36:51.640 --> 01:36:53.640
and you felt like, well, this is just sort of how it goes.

01:36:53.640 --> 01:36:55.640
There's a lot of contention sometimes.

01:36:55.640 --> 01:36:56.640
This is nothing like that.

01:36:56.640 --> 01:37:01.640
Like we're living in a fucking history book right now and it's shit is going down

01:37:01.640 --> 01:37:05.640
and we don't have to be doomsayers, but we don't have to choose between that

01:37:05.640 --> 01:37:11.640
and being naive, but I think that it is valuable for us to get out there

01:37:11.640 --> 01:37:18.640
and it's easier than you think to just go like, well, maybe it's easier than you think.

01:37:18.640 --> 01:37:19.640
Let's ask Harry.

01:37:19.640 --> 01:37:24.640
Like you can show up to this shit and no one is going to demand that you handcuff yourself

01:37:24.640 --> 01:37:26.640
to a redwood tree and get cut down with it.

01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:29.640
Like you can show up, dip your toe in.

01:37:29.640 --> 01:37:31.640
You can bring Krispy Kreme donuts.

01:37:31.640 --> 01:37:37.640
Like if you believe in privilege, then privilege is a weapon at these places.

01:37:37.640 --> 01:37:46.640
Like your lily white face, your lack of antagonism, as unfair as it is to a cop

01:37:46.640 --> 01:37:52.640
that's looking through a riot helmet, it actually can be a tool that you're not using

01:37:52.640 --> 01:37:54.640
if you don't go to these things.

01:37:54.640 --> 01:37:58.640
So Cody and I are trying to figure it out.

01:37:58.640 --> 01:38:00.640
Like we've got to go to this shit.

01:38:00.640 --> 01:38:05.640
Black Lives Matter protests must be in dreadful need of big fat white people.

01:38:05.640 --> 01:38:08.640
Like just to go under the middle.

01:38:08.640 --> 01:38:09.640
They're hand raised here.

01:38:09.640 --> 01:38:10.640
Let's all do it.

01:38:10.640 --> 01:38:12.640
Let's all do it right now.

01:38:12.640 --> 01:38:14.640
There's got to be a protest going on.

01:38:14.640 --> 01:38:15.640
Well, that's an idea.

01:38:15.640 --> 01:38:16.640
I want to tell you what to do.

01:38:16.640 --> 01:38:23.640
The thing is we have a president who doesn't read and doesn't probably know how to read well.

01:38:23.640 --> 01:38:30.640
And whether he's dyslexic or he just has whatever, like he's just like a willfully ignorant person,

01:38:30.640 --> 01:38:34.640
he cannot and does not look at words, but he does look at images.

01:38:34.640 --> 01:38:38.640
And I think the only thing that can really fuck him up is the visual stunning images

01:38:38.640 --> 01:38:42.640
of a zillion people protesting his every fucking move.

01:38:42.640 --> 01:38:45.640
And I think the thing that fucked him off more than anything in the world

01:38:45.640 --> 01:38:51.640
was the day after his shitily attended inauguration was that women and a couple honorable,

01:38:51.640 --> 01:38:55.640
like honorary dudes got to go out there and filled the streets.

01:38:55.640 --> 01:38:57.640
The biggest protest in the country's history.

01:38:57.640 --> 01:39:01.640
And he does see pictures because he's a child.

01:39:01.640 --> 01:39:04.640
He wouldn't.

01:39:04.640 --> 01:39:07.640
So we have to go to every fucking thing.

01:39:07.640 --> 01:39:10.640
And Armenians are, you're on the spectrum.

01:39:10.640 --> 01:39:11.640
You're logical.

01:39:11.640 --> 01:39:17.640
You're like thinking, like we need your, we need you to just,

01:39:17.640 --> 01:39:19.640
no one wants you to be different.

01:39:19.640 --> 01:39:23.640
No one wants you to be less logical, less analytical, less alienated, less isolated.

01:39:23.640 --> 01:39:30.640
I'm just suggesting for a second that that logical, analytical brain,

01:39:30.640 --> 01:39:33.640
what's that?

01:39:33.640 --> 01:39:38.640
Hear him out.

01:39:38.640 --> 01:39:40.640
Hear him out.

01:39:40.640 --> 01:39:42.640
Why?

01:39:42.640 --> 01:39:45.640
Everyone, but that guy is invited.

01:39:45.640 --> 01:39:47.640
I'll answer your question a second, sir.

01:39:47.640 --> 01:39:48.640
I think I know what your question is.

01:39:48.640 --> 01:39:50.640
I will.

01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:54.640
Why do we need white people for the Black Lives Matter?

01:39:54.640 --> 01:39:59.640
Because Black Lives Matter protests are not suggesting that black lives are the only ones that matter.

01:39:59.640 --> 01:40:02.640
Absolutely.

01:40:02.640 --> 01:40:09.640
We're sitting here saying we need white people to make this little bit matter.

01:40:09.640 --> 01:40:11.640
Because cops love us as the answer.

01:40:11.640 --> 01:40:15.640
Yes, but it's also very important as white people assess the value you bring to the table,

01:40:15.640 --> 01:40:17.640
some of which is your privilege.

01:40:17.640 --> 01:40:22.640
But also don't forget to listen to people who are way more disenfranchised than you.

01:40:22.640 --> 01:40:25.640
If you show up to a Black Lives Matter protest as a white person,

01:40:25.640 --> 01:40:28.640
fucking listen to the black people when they tell you what to do or to not do.

01:40:28.640 --> 01:40:30.640
Yeah, church.

01:40:30.640 --> 01:40:35.640
You were saying at the Ferguson thing that you were among the white people at the Ferguson protest

01:40:35.640 --> 01:40:38.640
and that you got big respect and lots of love for being there.

01:40:38.640 --> 01:40:43.640
Oh, well, I was among many white people who were there joining them in their effort.

01:40:43.640 --> 01:40:48.640
And the conversation that I had with a couple of girls as we marched

01:40:48.640 --> 01:40:52.640
and were met by police every time we turned a corner

01:40:52.640 --> 01:40:58.640
was the fact that they were happy that I was there and to see so many white people turning up to support them.

01:40:58.640 --> 01:41:02.640
And not just white people, but, you know, Mexicans coming out and being like,

01:41:02.640 --> 01:41:04.640
yeah, like Black Lives Matter.

01:41:04.640 --> 01:41:09.640
Because what they need is to not be preaching to the choir

01:41:09.640 --> 01:41:13.640
and to not just be yelling amongst themselves was how they communicated it to me.

01:41:13.640 --> 01:41:18.640
They're like, we need the community to show that they support this idea

01:41:18.640 --> 01:41:20.640
whether they're black themselves or not.

01:41:20.640 --> 01:41:24.640
Because he may be voicing like an id part of the brain that's like,

01:41:24.640 --> 01:41:28.640
or not to diminish that, but it's like, I want to make sure I understand

01:41:28.640 --> 01:41:31.640
to the extent that you're speaking for some part of our brain.

01:41:31.640 --> 01:41:35.640
Like, well, what's the point of all this egalitarianism if we're talking about these like,

01:41:35.640 --> 01:41:37.640
now we're going to become little fascists and say,

01:41:37.640 --> 01:41:39.640
we need more white people here and we need black people here.

01:41:39.640 --> 01:41:41.640
Like, we're becoming too racially conscious.

01:41:41.640 --> 01:41:46.640
Maybe that's part of what you're responding to is like, wait, I thought you were liberals.

01:41:46.640 --> 01:41:50.640
Why are we now talking about people like they're insects and sorting them by race?

01:41:50.640 --> 01:41:52.640
Isn't that what we're trying to get away from?

01:41:52.640 --> 01:41:59.640
I'm not putting words in your brain, but like, maybe that's like what you're responding to.

01:41:59.640 --> 01:42:02.640
White people listen to other white people too.

01:42:02.640 --> 01:42:04.640
Like historically they don't listen to black voices.

01:42:04.640 --> 01:42:05.640
Exactly.

01:42:05.640 --> 01:42:10.640
So like, while you should as a white person be the person in charge,

01:42:10.640 --> 01:42:13.640
like be the messenger to your white friends.

01:42:13.640 --> 01:42:14.640
Ambassador.

01:42:14.640 --> 01:42:15.640
Sure.

01:42:15.640 --> 01:42:19.640
But also there's another thing that's like, just even if you don't leave your apartment,

01:42:19.640 --> 01:42:26.640
like that analytical brain of yours that fires on the pistons, you know, like, it's really, really easy.

01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:28.640
It feels really comfortable.

01:42:28.640 --> 01:42:34.640
It's like a foot slipping into a warm hug, like, to fall back on that.

01:42:34.640 --> 01:42:38.640
If you're Spock and you're watching what's happening right now,

01:42:38.640 --> 01:42:42.640
you're definitely like, if you commit to that Vulcan energy,

01:42:42.640 --> 01:42:48.640
you are definitely always going to be like, well, none of this really makes any sense.

01:42:48.640 --> 01:42:51.640
It doesn't really make sense to do anything.

01:42:51.640 --> 01:42:55.640
Doing stuff will never hold up to logic.

01:42:55.640 --> 01:43:01.640
And I think that it's like, all I'm saying is like, I'm not telling you what to do.

01:43:01.640 --> 01:43:07.640
I'm telling you that your drunk uncle who has spent like a really criminally long time

01:43:07.640 --> 01:43:10.640
like not giving a shit about this stuff is like super alarmed.

01:43:10.640 --> 01:43:13.640
And you can chalk that up to like, oh, your drunk uncle's gotten to that age

01:43:13.640 --> 01:43:15.640
where you start caring about that shit.

01:43:15.640 --> 01:43:17.640
45-year-old people are uncharismatically political.

01:43:17.640 --> 01:43:19.640
Like, that's what happens.

01:43:19.640 --> 01:43:20.640
I'm 25.

01:43:20.640 --> 01:43:21.640
I don't fucking care about Bitcoin.

01:43:21.640 --> 01:43:25.640
I don't give a shit about this.

01:43:25.640 --> 01:43:27.640
And I don't know that you're wrong.

01:43:27.640 --> 01:43:35.640
I will only just tell you that your drunk uncle has decided that this is fucking like we're entering a crossroads.

01:43:35.640 --> 01:43:41.640
Like there's forth rike or there's like, like rebirth or probably something in between.

01:43:41.640 --> 01:43:46.640
But like, as people keep saying, like, you know, all those fantasies about time traveling

01:43:46.640 --> 01:43:49.640
and going back to these points in history and what would you do if you were there?

01:43:49.640 --> 01:43:51.640
You were actually in one right now.

01:43:51.640 --> 01:43:53.640
And you have never been in one.

01:43:53.640 --> 01:43:54.640
I have never been in one.

01:43:54.640 --> 01:43:57.640
I'm 44 and I've never, ever, I never did this.

01:43:57.640 --> 01:44:01.640
I voted for Ross Perot when I was 18 and thought like, I was like, yeah, fucking stiff the system.

01:44:01.640 --> 01:44:07.640
And so I thought, because there was a third party allowed at the debates and I was like, this guy's neat.

01:44:07.640 --> 01:44:09.640
And he's like, what do I care about abortion?

01:44:09.640 --> 01:44:15.640
If a raccoon don't hunt, who cares if it's pregnant?

01:44:15.640 --> 01:44:21.640
And I was like, so, and it's worth noting that that probably makes me a guy

01:44:21.640 --> 01:44:25.640
that might have been susceptible to a kind of like weird hacky Trump kind of thing.

01:44:25.640 --> 01:44:28.640
Like if I was 23 these days.

01:44:28.640 --> 01:44:32.640
But I doubt a lot of those people are in my audience.

01:44:32.640 --> 01:44:39.640
But but I at the same time, I think a lot of my listeners are probably like very wisely,

01:44:39.640 --> 01:44:46.640
guardingly, like, yeah, but I don't want to be one of these like liberals that like screams and shrieks

01:44:46.640 --> 01:44:53.640
and goes like, you know, like, like, like, I hate, you know, like, it's like, it throws your logic triggers.

01:44:53.640 --> 01:44:58.640
You got like, that's not that can't be a good result. Like this is all about escalation.

01:44:58.640 --> 01:44:59.640
I see that a lot.

01:44:59.640 --> 01:45:07.640
All I'm saying is so then what you could do is like, and if we have to coordinate it like through this podcast or something

01:45:07.640 --> 01:45:10.640
so that you know, for instance, hey, I'll be there too.

01:45:10.640 --> 01:45:15.640
And we'll have donuts and coffee and like, like, like the like, let's let's go to this shit.

01:45:15.640 --> 01:45:21.640
I was, yeah, I would say let's put out a whatever we can do to put out that bat signal and say like, like, we live in LA.

01:45:21.640 --> 01:45:27.640
Like, let's make sure that the people that live here know that like, if it matters, we're going there.

01:45:27.640 --> 01:45:34.640
And also, let's find out like for people that are listening around the country and around the world where they're going to go

01:45:34.640 --> 01:45:36.640
and let's all like make a loud noise.

01:45:36.640 --> 01:45:43.640
Like Spencer, I want to ask you because you've been very vocal like, like Twitter and stuff like that about like, you're, you know,

01:45:43.640 --> 01:45:47.640
you've been very activist like talking myself. Are you a physical activist?

01:45:47.640 --> 01:45:52.640
You just like want to go out and do stuff or are you more like, I'm not making a joke.

01:45:52.640 --> 01:45:58.640
Like, are you are you someone that would actually get out there and like, no, my flight came home a day early.

01:45:58.640 --> 01:46:03.640
So did not make it out.

01:46:03.640 --> 01:46:04.640
I'm not making a joke.

01:46:04.640 --> 01:46:06.640
Like, are you someone that would take to the streets?

01:46:06.640 --> 01:46:09.640
Like, would you get out there and like, I'm for it. Sure.

01:46:09.640 --> 01:46:11.640
Yeah, yeah, I say we do.

01:46:11.640 --> 01:46:16.640
Certainly there's the one in LA for the tax thing on a was it that's not like April though.

01:46:16.640 --> 01:46:18.640
Yeah, no, there was a march today.

01:46:18.640 --> 01:46:23.640
Yeah, there was a march is all like, like, like almost every day.

01:46:23.640 --> 01:46:28.640
There might be ways to foment, like change rebellion, get the health out of this process.

01:46:28.640 --> 01:46:33.640
That has nothing to do with you going and holding up a sign or a clever t-shirt or whatever.

01:46:33.640 --> 01:46:35.640
If you're a hacker, don't go to a protest.

01:46:35.640 --> 01:46:36.640
Fucking get those tax returns.

01:46:36.640 --> 01:46:38.640
Like, stay home.

01:46:38.640 --> 01:46:45.640
If you're a fan fiction writer, start one of these rogue government accounts and do like, like, like lie.

01:46:45.640 --> 01:46:53.640
And spread propaganda, messaging, figure out ways to whittle away at the heart of the American people.

01:46:53.640 --> 01:46:57.640
Like, go like, like, like, go like, yeah, like, what is the angle?

01:46:57.640 --> 01:47:07.640
Like, because the frontal assault of the opposition party was like, through these like, kind of like, really brute force misspelled memes and stuff.

01:47:07.640 --> 01:47:10.640
It was like, it appeals to some lizard part of our brain.

01:47:10.640 --> 01:47:16.640
I don't think we should compete in that playground, but when I see these like, rogue government accounts, like, it occurs to me.

01:47:16.640 --> 01:47:28.640
It's like, if this is fake, then this is amazing anti-meme technology because it draws in, like, turning the idea that there's rebellion going on into fan fiction, for instance,

01:47:28.640 --> 01:47:39.640
and actually properly punctuating and using good grammar to create the illusion that you're reading a Twitter feed from inside the White House as the rebellion is happening.

01:47:39.640 --> 01:47:45.640
It's like, that's like a really important way to use your nerdiness, your whatever.

01:47:45.640 --> 01:47:48.640
What are we talking about?

01:47:48.640 --> 01:47:50.640
What can we do to help?

01:47:50.640 --> 01:47:51.640
You're already doing it.

01:47:51.640 --> 01:47:54.640
In the words of Jell-O we offer, don't hate the media, become the media.

01:47:54.640 --> 01:47:56.640
Go take photos.

01:47:56.640 --> 01:48:01.640
Well, I'm asking from the perspective of an audience that's also being kind of encouraged here.

01:48:01.640 --> 01:48:07.640
But, you know, it occurs to me that not everybody in this audience may actually agree with what we're saying.

01:48:07.640 --> 01:48:09.640
We don't know a lot of the listeners right now either.

01:48:09.640 --> 01:48:10.640
Oh, that's for sure.

01:48:10.640 --> 01:48:13.640
But then, call me and we can talk about it.

01:48:13.640 --> 01:48:15.640
I want to know what you feel.

01:48:15.640 --> 01:48:17.640
If you disagree, I'd love to hear how you feel.

01:48:17.640 --> 01:48:25.640
But I do think that, like, whatever that means, not everybody's going to be able to go out and protest or whatever it is, you know, that we're talking about.

01:48:25.640 --> 01:48:28.640
You're raising your fingers.

01:48:28.640 --> 01:48:31.640
Oh, let's let her talk, baby.

01:48:31.640 --> 01:48:38.640
I'm just going to say the groups that you're raising money for the ACLU is the absolute best way to do it.

01:48:38.640 --> 01:48:42.640
You're fighting right now legally to shut this down immediately.

01:48:42.640 --> 01:48:47.640
And if you don't have the ability to go outside, you have the ability to get to support certain things like the ACLU.

01:48:47.640 --> 01:48:55.640
For everybody's birthday or upcoming, like if you're going to buy it, like I said, on Twitter, like Valentine's Day or anybody's upcoming birthday,

01:48:55.640 --> 01:49:02.640
instead of getting them some meaningless, like little trinket or whatever like that, just donate any small amount of money to ACLU.

01:49:02.640 --> 01:49:04.640
Especially your Redneck family.

01:49:04.640 --> 01:49:09.640
I think they average, like, $3 million, $4 million in donations a year.

01:49:09.640 --> 01:49:12.640
It's over $20 million, I think, right now.

01:49:12.640 --> 01:49:14.640
Like, since like two weeks ago.

01:49:14.640 --> 01:49:17.640
So, also start giving money to more other organizations.

01:49:17.640 --> 01:49:18.640
Exactly.

01:49:18.640 --> 01:49:19.640
Because ACLU is good for them.

01:49:19.640 --> 01:49:20.640
Yeah, yeah.

01:49:20.640 --> 01:49:26.640
Like, no, you're not doing your matching, that's good, but like also there's like, we got to, you can't just give to one.

01:49:26.640 --> 01:49:27.640
I might have choked back.

01:49:27.640 --> 01:49:33.640
We kind of like got in on it and then we're like, they just reported that they have $200 billion.

01:49:33.640 --> 01:49:37.640
But I think, but also I think the ACLU can use every penny.

01:49:37.640 --> 01:49:38.640
Absolutely.

01:49:38.640 --> 01:49:39.640
That's not to say we shouldn't be.

01:49:39.640 --> 01:49:42.640
But donate like time.

01:49:42.640 --> 01:49:43.640
If you don't have money, donate time.

01:49:43.640 --> 01:49:46.640
And if you don't have time or money, donate your voice to stuff like that.

01:49:46.640 --> 01:49:56.640
If you're a foodie and a chef and you're barely political, you might just be like, I feel bad for hungry people that are protesting at these places.

01:49:56.640 --> 01:50:07.640
Like, I think the important thing to know as a person that got dropped privilege dlee and lazily into the middle of a protest and found out it's actually very comfortable and easy.

01:50:07.640 --> 01:50:17.640
And now therefore may have the courage to like get up and like put on my fanny pack and like go to one.

01:50:17.640 --> 01:50:19.640
It's easier than you think.

01:50:19.640 --> 01:50:20.640
It's not a criminal activity.

01:50:20.640 --> 01:50:24.640
You don't have to commit to like take me to jail, mace me in the face.

01:50:24.640 --> 01:50:26.640
I think the numbers count.

01:50:26.640 --> 01:50:29.640
The complexions count for bad reasons, sir.

01:50:29.640 --> 01:50:32.640
It's because it's an unfair system, whatever.

01:50:32.640 --> 01:50:33.640
It's just a strategy.

01:50:33.640 --> 01:50:35.640
It's just more strategy.

01:50:35.640 --> 01:50:43.640
Saying like get the more news articles about a bunch of people like showing up and saying this is bullshit.

01:50:43.640 --> 01:50:48.640
I think the imagery is going to speak louder because people stopped reading and people don't believe anything that's told to them.

01:50:48.640 --> 01:50:56.640
I think pictures of who showed up to which inauguration are undeniable and the fact that a zillion women came out like that.

01:50:56.640 --> 01:50:58.640
Like what beats that shit?

01:50:58.640 --> 01:51:01.640
Like like nothing beats that and it was all over the world.

01:51:01.640 --> 01:51:02.640
Like people did it everywhere.

01:51:02.640 --> 01:51:06.640
How about the fucking like 12 people in bitter ass cold Alaska?

01:51:06.640 --> 01:51:09.640
That's like hats off to all of them.

01:51:09.640 --> 01:51:13.640
Like that picture made me cry.

01:51:13.640 --> 01:51:15.640
Like that's heavy fucking hitting.

01:51:15.640 --> 01:51:21.640
Like a picture says way more than any tweet or anything like that.

01:51:21.640 --> 01:51:29.640
And a bunch of people smiling and the fact that there were no arrests and everybody like I kept stepping on people's toes and they were cool about it.

01:51:29.640 --> 01:51:32.640
Like during the women's protest it was it was fucking magical.

01:51:32.640 --> 01:51:36.640
Also I'm so sorry to everybody that's listening from Alabama.

01:51:36.640 --> 01:51:37.640
Why only all this stuff?

01:51:37.640 --> 01:51:42.640
Like I'm always taking shits and it's like I fall for that like red versus blue thing.

01:51:42.640 --> 01:51:44.640
And it's like you see these photos.

01:51:44.640 --> 01:51:48.640
It's like oh it's Alabama and there's like people's thrusting signs in the air.

01:51:48.640 --> 01:51:49.640
It's like fuck Nazis.

01:51:49.640 --> 01:51:50.640
You know it's like of course.

01:51:50.640 --> 01:51:54.640
You know Dan the way to make it up to them is because it's about the end of the show.

01:51:54.640 --> 01:51:59.640
Maybe you do a nice laid back apology to those people.

01:51:59.640 --> 01:52:03.640
And you know church if you want to do like the Rihanna hook on it.

01:52:03.640 --> 01:52:07.640
Oh my god church is yeah she's also.

01:52:07.640 --> 01:52:12.640
Oh my god I forgot about church's other identity.

01:52:12.640 --> 01:52:14.640
Yo.

01:52:14.640 --> 01:52:16.640
It's about to get so gosh.

01:52:16.640 --> 01:52:19.640
Rob Spencer Harry if you want to get in here.

01:52:19.640 --> 01:52:20.640
Yo.

01:52:20.640 --> 01:52:26.640
It's about time about time for the rhyme about democracy.

01:52:26.640 --> 01:52:30.640
Stop hip hop hip hop hip hypocrisy.

01:52:30.640 --> 01:52:38.640
From the A to the B to the C to the B to the E of G to the H I J P element of B.

01:52:38.640 --> 01:52:40.640
Alphabet Latin.

01:52:40.640 --> 01:52:41.640
XYZ.

01:52:41.640 --> 01:52:43.640
I'm talking alphabets.

01:52:43.640 --> 01:52:47.640
But that's off topic.

01:52:47.640 --> 01:52:48.640
Language.

01:52:48.640 --> 01:52:51.640
What do you use when you fuck your mama's pussy?

01:52:51.640 --> 01:52:54.640
Do you blow her fuse?

01:52:54.640 --> 01:52:56.640
Go down to the breaker.

01:52:56.640 --> 01:52:59.640
I brought your mama a taker.

01:52:59.640 --> 01:53:03.640
I take her into the bedroom.

01:53:03.640 --> 01:53:07.640
To the break of dawn.

01:53:07.640 --> 01:53:12.640
I fucked your mama to the break of dawn.

01:53:12.640 --> 01:53:17.640
Why is it that we fuck to the break of dawn?

01:53:17.640 --> 01:53:28.640
Is that a hard out?

01:53:28.640 --> 01:53:35.640
Or is it more, are we saying like I'm going to fuck you for a long time?

01:53:35.640 --> 01:53:40.640
The more you think about it you start to think like wait are we vampires?

01:53:40.640 --> 01:53:46.640
Does your dick stop working as the sun breaks the horizon?

01:53:46.640 --> 01:53:50.640
Oh baby sorry thank you for letting me fuck you.

01:53:50.640 --> 01:53:53.640
Dawn has broken.

01:53:53.640 --> 01:54:00.640
If you don't mind I'm just going to force myself to fucking comment.

01:54:00.640 --> 01:54:06.640
My therapist is asking me a question when they're neurologically I'm actually jerking off to the break of dawn at this point.

01:54:06.640 --> 01:54:09.640
I'm not even sure if I'm attracted to women.

01:54:09.640 --> 01:54:15.640
I'm becoming more of a strange dawn fetishist.

01:54:15.640 --> 01:54:22.640
I'm gonna lay your body down.

01:54:22.640 --> 01:54:27.640
Like a clown.

01:54:27.640 --> 01:54:31.640
My name is MC America.

01:54:31.640 --> 01:54:35.640
Don't be hysterical about what's going on.

01:54:35.640 --> 01:54:39.640
Just got some Nazis on the front lawn.

01:54:39.640 --> 01:54:43.640
Grab your Glock 1719.

01:54:43.640 --> 01:54:45.640
Protect your block.

01:54:45.640 --> 01:54:46.640
Know what I mean?

01:54:46.640 --> 01:54:47.640
Protect your housekeepers.

01:54:47.640 --> 01:54:49.640
Protect your Jewish friends.

01:54:49.640 --> 01:54:51.640
Your Mexican friends.

01:54:51.640 --> 01:54:52.640
Protect them.

01:54:52.640 --> 01:54:56.640
The means don't justify the answer.

01:54:56.640 --> 01:55:00.640
Build a crawl space if you have the time.

01:55:00.640 --> 01:55:07.640
We may be coming up in Anne Frank times.

01:55:07.640 --> 01:55:16.640
Not sure if you've grown the protection of innocent people.

01:55:16.640 --> 01:55:18.640
Or just against your conditions.

01:55:18.640 --> 01:55:21.640
You hear certain words and you react.

01:55:21.640 --> 01:55:22.640
And that's fine.

01:55:22.640 --> 01:55:27.640
But it's also why the fascist got elected.

01:55:27.640 --> 01:55:31.640
You are to blame.

01:55:31.640 --> 01:55:37.640
There's blood on your hands no matter whatever you pose.

01:55:37.640 --> 01:55:42.640
My name is Auto Tune Johnson.

01:55:42.640 --> 01:55:46.640
You'd think I'd be more in tune by now.

01:55:46.640 --> 01:55:47.640
Alright.

01:55:47.640 --> 01:55:48.640
Yo.

01:55:48.640 --> 01:55:49.640
Yo.

01:55:49.640 --> 01:55:50.640
My name is Yo.

01:55:50.640 --> 01:55:51.640
Yo.

01:55:51.640 --> 01:55:52.640
My name is Yo.

01:55:52.640 --> 01:55:53.640
Yo.

01:55:53.640 --> 01:55:54.640
My name is Yo.

01:55:54.640 --> 01:55:55.640
Yo.

01:55:55.640 --> 01:55:56.640
Yo.

01:55:56.640 --> 01:55:57.640
My name is Yo.

01:55:57.640 --> 01:55:58.640
Yo.

01:55:58.640 --> 01:55:59.640
Go.

01:55:59.640 --> 01:56:00.640
Yo.

01:56:00.640 --> 01:56:04.640
I fucked your mama so hard she looked like Nero.

01:56:04.640 --> 01:56:08.640
A Roman emperor.

01:56:08.640 --> 01:56:09.640
Okay.

01:56:09.640 --> 01:56:35.640
I woke up this morning, had some bread.

01:56:35.640 --> 01:56:42.640
I got a stomach ache, went back to bed, I took some night quill with night PM.

01:56:42.640 --> 01:56:43.640
Yo.

01:56:43.640 --> 01:56:44.640
Yo.

01:56:44.640 --> 01:56:47.640
I sat up in bed said, whoa, I had a nightmare.

01:56:47.640 --> 01:56:50.640
Went downstairs and I went back upstairs.

01:56:50.640 --> 01:56:52.640
Nightmare and upstairs rhymes.

01:56:52.640 --> 01:56:56.640
And I went downstairs, went downstairs and had a nightmare on the stairs.

01:56:56.640 --> 01:56:58.640
I had a stared nightmare.

01:56:58.640 --> 01:56:59.640
I had a night stare.

01:56:59.640 --> 01:57:01.640
I went stared at my own stairs.

01:57:01.640 --> 01:57:04.640
And I would did it at night and I did it in the day.

01:57:04.640 --> 01:57:07.640
I fucked your mama so hard her pussy grew some hay.

01:57:07.640 --> 01:57:08.640
Wait.

01:57:08.640 --> 01:57:09.640
Okay.

01:57:09.640 --> 01:57:10.640
All right.

01:57:10.640 --> 01:57:11.640
Here we go.

01:57:11.640 --> 01:57:12.640
Wait.

01:57:12.640 --> 01:57:13.640
But I want you to really belt it out.

01:57:13.640 --> 01:57:16.640
You're being, you're like, but I know you're waiting for me to do a recognizable like

01:57:16.640 --> 01:57:20.640
rap verse and then you're going to like fucking belt out like a hook.

01:57:20.640 --> 01:57:21.640
Okay.

01:57:21.640 --> 01:57:22.640
Here we go.

01:57:22.640 --> 01:57:23.640
Yo.

01:57:23.640 --> 01:57:24.640
Yo.

01:57:24.640 --> 01:57:25.640
City to city.

01:57:25.640 --> 01:57:26.640
Town to town.

01:57:26.640 --> 01:57:29.640
I fucked your mama's frown until it was upside down.

01:57:29.640 --> 01:57:30.640
She was a smile.

01:57:30.640 --> 01:57:32.640
I made her happy.

01:57:32.640 --> 01:57:35.640
I fucked your mama so hard the sounds were slappy.

01:57:35.640 --> 01:57:38.640
We heard my balls going up against your butt.

01:57:38.640 --> 01:57:43.640
I fucked your mama and served her hot nuts in a bowl.

01:57:43.640 --> 01:57:44.640
Walnuts too.

01:57:44.640 --> 01:57:45.640
I got the almonds.

01:57:45.640 --> 01:57:48.640
What you're going to cash you do.

01:57:48.640 --> 01:57:50.640
I got the cashew to you.

01:57:50.640 --> 01:57:58.640
Got the cashew you got the cashew to do.

01:57:58.640 --> 01:58:01.640
That's you.

01:58:01.640 --> 01:58:06.640
If not me, then who?

01:58:06.640 --> 01:58:07.640
All right.

01:58:07.640 --> 01:58:08.640
Sorry.

01:58:08.640 --> 01:58:09.640
All right.

01:58:09.640 --> 01:58:10.640
Oh yeah.

01:58:10.640 --> 01:58:11.640
I woke up.

01:58:11.640 --> 01:58:13.640
I'm the fourth of July.

01:58:13.640 --> 01:58:18.640
I set my countries in trouble and I wonder why I went out in the street and I saw all

01:58:18.640 --> 01:58:19.640
of the people.

01:58:19.640 --> 01:58:21.640
Why do I always rhyme people?

01:58:21.640 --> 01:58:23.640
The only thing is steeple.

01:58:23.640 --> 01:58:25.640
That's the only thing you could ever do.

01:58:25.640 --> 01:58:27.640
Starting over.

01:58:27.640 --> 01:58:30.640
I woke up in a bed.

01:58:30.640 --> 01:58:34.640
Then I ate some bread.

01:58:34.640 --> 01:58:37.640
But that bread was freedom.

01:58:37.640 --> 01:58:40.640
My name is Hal Needham.

01:58:40.640 --> 01:58:43.640
Freedom Breads.

01:58:43.640 --> 01:58:46.640
Take a church.

01:58:46.640 --> 01:58:52.640
Is that white bread?

01:58:52.640 --> 01:58:56.640
Thank you for coming to Harmon's Den everybody.

01:58:56.640 --> 01:59:01.640
Let's hear it, Cassandra Church.

01:59:01.640 --> 01:59:04.640
Harry, the pickle-hitting protester.

01:59:04.640 --> 01:59:06.640
Rob Schrobb.

01:59:06.640 --> 01:59:08.640
Adam Goldberg.

01:59:08.640 --> 01:59:10.640
Spencer Crittenden.

01:59:10.640 --> 01:59:12.640
I'm Jeff Davis.

01:59:12.640 --> 01:59:14.640
Your mayor, Dan Harmon.

01:59:14.640 --> 01:59:15.640
Thank you, Harry.

01:59:15.640 --> 01:59:17.640
Harry for sharing his.

01:59:17.640 --> 01:59:19.640
Thank you all.

01:59:19.640 --> 01:59:20.640
Let's organize.

01:59:20.640 --> 01:59:22.640
Let's take down the tangerine tyrants.

01:59:22.640 --> 01:59:24.640
And then what?

01:59:24.640 --> 01:59:27.640
Last, they take chances.

01:59:43.640 --> 01:59:45.640
Did you get any of that?

01:59:45.640 --> 01:59:55.640
It's a good show.
