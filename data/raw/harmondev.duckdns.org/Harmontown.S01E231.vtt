01:08.000\nThank you, thank you very much.\n\n01:08.000 --> 01:13.000\nI was just watching Lady Gaga's half-time thing.\n\n01:13.000 --> 01:15.000\nIt's pretty awesome.\n\n01:15.000 --> 01:20.000\nI risk nothing by saying I admire Lady Gaga.\n\n01:20.000 --> 01:24.000\nNo one's going to boo me for saying that.\n\n01:24.000 --> 01:28.000\nWell, one person wants to be special.\n\n01:28.000 --> 01:31.000\nThat's more just you cheering yourself.\n\n01:31.000 --> 01:33.000\nCheering narcissism.\n\n01:33.000 --> 01:35.000\nI'm not your average fan!\n\n01:35.000 --> 01:38.000\nPeople on Twitter are always tweeting at me\n\n01:38.000 --> 01:39.000\nand going like,\n\n01:39.000 --> 01:41.000\nI know you won't say anything\n\n01:41.000 --> 01:43.000\nunless I say something negative.\n\n01:43.000 --> 01:45.000\nSo fuck you!\n\n01:45.000 --> 01:48.000\nJust kidding, I love your work.\n\n01:48.000 --> 01:57.000\nYou're not wrong, but I black people that do

02:06.000\nIf you truly love me,\n\n02:06.000 --> 02:09.000\nyou should accept my laziness.\n\n02:09.000 --> 02:11.000\nYou should be my codependent lover.\n\n02:11.000 --> 02:14.000\nYou should just support me.\n\n02:14.000 --> 02:17.000\nAnd my good mood should be your good mood.\n\n02:17.000 --> 02:19.000\nYou should need anything from me.\n\n02:19.000 --> 02:21.000\nOr I'm out the door!\n\n02:21.000 --> 02:23.000\nAnd you know that about me.\n\n02:23.000 --> 02:24.000\nYou've learned that about me.\n\n02:24.000 --> 02:26.000\nYou've put up with four years of abuse.\n\n02:26.000 --> 02:29.000\nYou've lied to doctors for me.\n\n02:29.000 --> 02:31.000\nToo soon.\n\n02:31.000 --> 02:33.000\nToo soon.\n\n02:33.000 --> 02:36.000\nAnd 60,000 years of misogyny.\n\n02:36.000 --> 02:39.000\nWhat was it that struck you positively\n\n02:39.000 --> 02:40.000\nabout Lady Gaga?\n\n02:40.000 --> 02:42.000\nWell, first of all, her fucking,\n\n02:42.000 --> 02:45.000\nnot only her wire work in general,\n\n02:45.000 --> 02:47.000\nbut as a decision is always in a me.\n\n02:47.000 --> 02:50.000\nI admire anyone who chooses wire work.\n\n02:50.000 --> 02:53.000\nFrom Garth Brooks to Beyonce to anybody.\n\n02:53.000 --> 02:58.000\nIf you say, bring out wires,\n\n02:58.000 --> 03:01.000\nI'm already on your side.\n\n03:01.000 --> 03:04.000\nI'm not going to side with gravity.\n\n03:04.000 --> 03:07.000\nI don't hope you fall and hurt yourself.\n\n03:07.000 --> 03:10.000\nI admire you, and I wouldn't be willing to do it.\n\n03:10.000 --> 03:12.000\nBut then, having chosen wires,\n\n03:12.000 --> 03:13.000\nshe didn't just,\n\n03:13.000 --> 03:15.000\nas you know, I've been in the shit.\n\n03:15.000 --> 03:17.000\nI was at Radio City Music Hall.\n\n03:17.000 --> 03:19.000\nI wrote for the 2006 VMAs.\n\n03:19.000 --> 03:21.000\nBeyonce, queen me,\n\n03:21.000 --> 03:23.000\nshe came plummeted down on some fucking wires.\n\n03:23.000 --> 03:24.000\nI watched her rehearse.\n\n03:24.000 --> 03:27.000\nShe's a pro.\n\n03:27.000 --> 03:29.000\nStuddingly gorgeous, amazing woman.\n\n03:29.000 --> 03:30.000\nGreat wire work.\n\n03:30.000 --> 03:31.000\nShe's great.\n\n03:31.000 --> 03:34.000\nBut Lady Gaga, so many years later,\n\n03:34.000 --> 03:36.000\nstarts at the top of the stadium.\n\n03:36.000 --> 03:39.000\nShe jumped off a regular person.\n\n03:39.000 --> 03:41.000\nBut then it cut wide,\n\n03:41.000 --> 03:44.000\nand she was doing this Spider-Man jiggle\n\n03:44.000 --> 03:45.000\non the way down.\n\n03:45.000 --> 03:47.000\nAnd I thought that was a cool thing to commit to.\n\n03:47.000 --> 03:50.000\nHere's what I liked about Lady Gaga's performance.\n\n03:50.000 --> 03:52.000\nShe did everything that I would do\n\n03:52.000 --> 03:55.000\nif I was in wires.\n\n03:55.000 --> 03:58.000\nI would also do that on the way down,\n\n03:58.000 --> 04:01.000\nbecause I'd be like a little spider.\n\n04:01.000 --> 04:04.000\nShe didn't try to act like it's natural\n\n04:04.000 --> 04:07.000\nthat she's like Helen Slater and Supergirl.\n\n04:07.000 --> 04:09.000\nI want to give some props to the people\n\n04:09.000 --> 04:11.000\nthat created that rig, because those harnesses,\n\n04:11.000 --> 04:15.000\nshe was wearing a very small, skimpy outfit.\n\n04:15.000 --> 04:18.000\nShe has a very tiny rig underneath that,\n\n04:18.000 --> 04:20.000\nand that's not comfortable.\n\n04:20.000 --> 04:24.000\nFor that to work, it's tighter than you want it to be,\n\n04:24.000 --> 04:27.000\nfor that to be a safe mechanism.\n\n04:27.000 --> 04:30.000\nShe committed to lip-syncing a whole thing,\n\n04:30.000 --> 04:33.000\nbut there's no way to sing when you have that thing on you,\n\n04:33.000 --> 04:37.000\nbecause she's wearing a girdle made of girdles.\n\n04:37.000 --> 04:41.000\nShe took your lover, your life partner,\n\n04:41.000 --> 04:43.000\nyour S.O. church,\n\n04:43.000 --> 04:45.000\nwe were watching in the green room,\n\n04:45.000 --> 04:47.000\nand she really successfully took a Supergirl halftime\n\n04:47.000 --> 04:49.000\nand made it look like one of her videos,\n\n04:49.000 --> 04:51.000\nwhich is a huge feat for the whole team.\n\n04:51.000 --> 04:53.000\nI thought it looked wonderful.\n\n04:53.000 --> 04:58.000\nI don't understand what was Neil Patrick Harris\n\n04:58.000 --> 05:01.000\ntrying to tweet when he said he was gagging\n\n05:01.000 --> 05:04.000\nover her halftime show, because she's the best.\n\n05:04.000 --> 05:07.000\nDid he mean to say gagaing?\n\n05:07.000 --> 05:11.000\nOr is this new slang from the streets\n\n05:11.000 --> 05:13.000\nthat I got to catch up to?\n\n05:13.000 --> 05:15.000\nMan, I was gagging.\n\n05:15.000 --> 05:17.000\nYou're amazing.\n\n05:17.000 --> 05:19.000\nYour haircut's making me gag.\n\n05:19.000 --> 05:21.000\nWhat? Fuck you!\n\n05:21.000 --> 05:24.000\nGotcha, it's the future.\n\n05:24.000 --> 05:27.000\nNow, is Enti here today?\n\n05:27.000 --> 05:31.000\nEnti Kwaku, he tweeted,\n\n05:31.000 --> 05:33.000\nhe goes, I actually really like that.\n\n05:33.000 --> 05:35.000\nHe was down for that. He thought that was super cool.\n\n05:35.000 --> 05:38.000\nBut I think more importantly than Lady Gaga's performance,\n\n05:38.000 --> 05:42.000\nI think it's time to have a good old fashioned sports corner.\n\n05:42.000 --> 05:54.000\nWell, Jeff, I gotta tell you, I mean...\n\n05:54.000 --> 06:03.000\nSo, where do I start?\n\n06:03.000 --> 06:06.000\nThe fact that the Falcons lost a 25 point lead\n\n06:06.000 --> 06:08.000\nin the second half of the game?\n\n06:08.000 --> 06:10.000\nOh shit!\n\n06:10.000 --> 06:13.000\nWait, this is the first Super Bowl in history\n\n06:13.000 --> 06:16.000\nthat was won in overtime?\n\n06:16.000 --> 06:19.000\nThis guy did homework.\n\n06:19.000 --> 06:22.000\nYeah, because I was looking for Lady Gaga's video.\n\n06:22.000 --> 06:25.000\nI got spoiled.\n\n06:25.000 --> 06:28.000\nAside from Tom Brady, name one other player.\n\n06:28.000 --> 06:30.000\nBill Bilicheck.\n\n06:30.000 --> 06:33.000\nBecause I also saw Richard Spencer's tweet.\n\n06:33.000 --> 06:36.000\nRichard Spencer was given, he's now on Twitter,\n\n06:36.000 --> 06:38.000\nhe's like a racist gourmand.\n\n06:38.000 --> 06:40.000\nHe was like, I'm going for the Patriots\n\n06:40.000 --> 06:42.000\nand he had a little checklist.\n\n06:42.000 --> 06:45.000\nIt was like Tom Brady and Bilicheck both support Trump.\n\n06:45.000 --> 06:47.000\nMore white receivers.\n\n06:47.000 --> 06:50.000\nHe had all the racial stats for the Patriots.\n\n06:50.000 --> 06:54.000\nThe only team with three white receivers?\n\n06:54.000 --> 06:58.000\nYeah, he loves how white the football team is.\n\n06:58.000 --> 07:02.000\nBut typically people who are giving you sports statistics\n\n07:02.000 --> 07:04.000\nare helping you bet and win,\n\n07:04.000 --> 07:08.000\nbut he's just like, you know, my money's on the master race.\n\n07:08.000 --> 07:14.000\nSmart money is not on Arians for athletics\n\n07:14.000 --> 07:17.000\nsince the 1936 Olympics.\n\n07:17.000 --> 07:20.000\nIt's like, it's never been.\n\n07:20.000 --> 07:23.000\nWe settled that a long time ago.\n\n07:23.000 --> 07:28.000\nSteve Bannon looks like the time I tried to shave my sack.\n\n07:28.000 --> 07:31.000\nAnd absolutely failed.\n\n07:31.000 --> 07:34.000\nAs I tweeted today, he looks just like Bilicheck.\n\n07:34.000 --> 07:35.000\nThey both wear the same headset.\n\n07:35.000 --> 07:37.000\nBeards are in Steve Bannon.\n\n07:37.000 --> 07:41.000\nYou don't even have to look the way you do to grow on.\n\n07:41.000 --> 07:43.000\nYou should grow a beard.\n\n07:43.000 --> 07:46.000\nThat is uncomfortable, that face.\n\n07:46.000 --> 07:51.000\nThat is the face of someone who is proud of their race.\n\n07:51.000 --> 07:55.000\nAnd he also has straight up like W.C. Fields gin blossoms.\n\n07:55.000 --> 08:00.000\nHis eyes are like, they're like welling with blood tears.\n\n08:00.000 --> 08:06.000\nIt's like the nerdy version of the Casino Royale bad guy.\n\n08:06.000 --> 08:11.000\nLike he just has a blood stigmatism in both eyes.\n\n08:11.000 --> 08:15.000\nHe's a terrible writer, he's a terrible person.\n\n08:15.000 --> 08:20.000\nAnd we got to get him out because he's going to fucking kill me.\n\n08:20.000 --> 08:24.000\nI thought you were going to say, we got to get him on the show.\n\n08:24.000 --> 08:26.000\nYou saw the thing, I retweeted it.\n\n08:26.000 --> 08:29.000\nAnd you guys hang on my every tweet.\n\n08:29.000 --> 08:33.000\nAnd you re-hang on my every retweet.\n\n08:33.000 --> 08:37.000\nHe wrote a movie treatment.\n\n08:37.000 --> 08:41.000\nHe wanted to be, you know, he's like a hack that got a piece of Seinfeld somehow.\n\n08:41.000 --> 08:43.000\nHe's got points in Seinfeld.\n\n08:43.000 --> 08:46.000\nHe used to be in Hollywood before all of this happened.\n\n08:46.000 --> 08:49.000\nYeah, I think that's what gets my goat is that Trump and Bannon,\n\n08:49.000 --> 08:52.000\nthey both kind of represent the things I hate most about myself.\n\n08:52.000 --> 08:55.000\nLike other people are like, Trump reminds me of my dad.\n\n08:55.000 --> 08:57.000\nI'm like, my dad is way cooler than Donald Trump.\n\n08:57.000 --> 09:01.000\nLike it's me, it's like who is this remind me of when Donald Trump tweets.\n\n09:01.000 --> 09:03.000\nIt's like, oh, it's me, it's me.\n\n09:03.000 --> 09:07.000\nIt's like all the things that make him a bad person.\n\n09:07.000 --> 09:11.000\nBut anyways, but Steve Bannon reminds me of the bad writer part of me.\n\n09:11.000 --> 09:14.000\nLike there was some treatment that surfaced.\n\n09:14.000 --> 09:22.000\nIt's documentary style, of course, because hack, hackenstein.\n\n09:22.000 --> 09:27.000\nThere's like no narrative butt, nuts at all.\n\n09:27.000 --> 09:32.000\nNo narrative butts about, no narrative butts, no cuts, no narrative coconuts.\n\n09:32.000 --> 09:42.000\nPush the structural button, pull the dialogue chain out, come chocolate, poo poo train.\n\n09:42.000 --> 09:44.000\nShoot your train.\n\n09:44.000 --> 09:46.000\nAll right, anyways.\n\n09:46.000 --> 09:51.000\nThere's a treatment and it's like, and he refers to Islamic fascism,\n\n09:51.000 --> 09:53.000\nbut he spells it facism.\n\n09:53.000 --> 09:56.000\nWhat's the deal with this face?\n\n09:56.000 --> 09:59.000\nIs that like a thing that was that like a British thing?\n\n09:59.000 --> 10:02.000\nBecause too many people are worried about facism.\n\n10:02.000 --> 10:05.000\nWait, are you telling me you can spell it that way?\n\n10:05.000 --> 10:07.000\nI don't know, that's what I want to know.\n\n10:07.000 --> 10:10.000\nIt's so delicious that he just never looked up the word fascism.\n\n10:10.000 --> 10:12.000\nToo many people are doing it, and I don't know.\n\n10:12.000 --> 10:14.000\nI haven't bothered to look it up.\n\n10:14.000 --> 10:17.000\nHas anyone seen it spelled facism in the audience?\n\n10:17.000 --> 10:20.000\nI mean, is that like they spell favorite with a U?\n\n10:20.000 --> 10:22.000\nThat's what I'm wondering.\n\n10:22.000 --> 10:23.000\nI don't think so.\n\n10:23.000 --> 10:26.000\nI believe that many people are stupid, but it's just striking.\n\n10:26.000 --> 10:29.000\nI don't understand, well, I don't know.\n\n10:29.000 --> 10:34.000\nMy favorite new thing is like all the like armchair electronic forensics\n\n10:34.000 --> 10:38.000\nthat go on like when Trump, when the sheet left off the,\n\n10:38.000 --> 10:41.000\nit said that there was like the phone log of all the leaders Trump talked to,\n\n10:41.000 --> 10:45.000\nand then it was like, president of Mexico, talk to him, president of whatever,\n\n10:45.000 --> 10:47.000\npresident, president of whatever.\n\n10:47.000 --> 10:52.000\nAnd then it was like, it just said, talk to Australia or something like that.\n\n10:52.000 --> 10:56.000\nAnd it didn't have the guy's name and it was, or did it say president of Australia\n\n10:56.000 --> 10:57.000\nand then left it like that?\n\n10:57.000 --> 10:59.000\nThey did, at some point they had president there, yeah.\n\n10:59.000 --> 11:04.000\nBut they, yeah, somebody said like, oh, if you Google president in Australia,\n\n11:04.000 --> 11:09.000\nthere's no Wikipedia or Google hit that comes up, so they just left it blank.\n\n11:09.000 --> 11:13.000\nI'm like, oh my God, I love the backtracking and realizing like what,\n\n11:13.000 --> 11:16.000\nlike that with unprecedented too.\n\n11:16.000 --> 11:21.000\nI did the same thing, I typed in unprecedented and something came up that,\n\n11:21.000 --> 11:26.000\nI can't remember, I remember you can realize like you can walk in the shoes\n\n11:26.000 --> 11:31.000\nof stupid people and go like, oh my God, that's what happened\n\n11:31.000 --> 11:34.000\nand they're running everything and it's amazing.\n\n11:34.000 --> 11:39.000\nBut it's, you know, yeah, yeah, you know, we're, it's getting normal.\n\n11:39.000 --> 11:40.000\nWe're normalizing, right?\n\n11:40.000 --> 11:42.000\nThat's what we're supposed to do.\n\n11:42.000 --> 11:44.000\nNo, it's getting totally normal.\n\n11:44.000 --> 11:48.000\nIs there a William Ralph or Ralph William here in the crowd?\n\n11:48.000 --> 11:51.000\nWoo!

want to, I don't want to use this\n\n30:47.000 --> 30:49.880\nwant to use this term disparagingly to somebody that I really don't know or if\n\n30:49.880 --> 30:53.160\nthis is offensive term but she was essentially a male order bride right\n\n30:53.160 --> 30:57.680\nlike like like she was a few she was also a like a Russian model or what or\n\n30:57.680 --> 31:06.600\nwhat was if I don't trump

31:24.080\njust talking sexually I'm talking about psychosexual politics I'm talking about\n\n31:24.080 --> 31:31.040\nlike okay so first you have like a woman from your own country that you know it\n\n31:31.040 --> 31:36.640\njust was born within the same sort of you know glass ceilings aside the same\n\n31:36.640 --> 31:41.040\nsort of sandbox you were in with the same rules and things then she's gone\n\n31:41.040 --> 31:46.200\nshe's out of there then like Howard Hughes in the aviator it's like you know\n\n31:46.200 --> 31:50.000\nCatherine Hepburn takes a hike and then you cut to the airplane hangar scene\n\n31:50.000 --> 31:54.040\nwhere Howard Hughes is like bringing underage girls in and going like stop\n\n31:54.040 --> 31:57.240\nright there 300 meters away you understand you'll be an employee\n\n31:57.240 --> 32:01.320\ncontracted to me and you'll do what I say okay turn around alright wipe that\n\n32:01.320 --> 32:04.160\nlipstick off and stuff you know that scene in the aviator come on it's your\n\n32:04.160 --> 32:09.120\nfavorite movie right you've watched it 75 times because you have some perverse\n\n32:09.120 --> 32:14.000\nfantasy of being America's most famous mentally ill entrepreneur because it\n\n32:14.000 --> 32:20.480\nreminds you of yourself like I said and so I thought like like what that's how\n\n32:20.480 --> 32:27.280\nwe found Spencer but so you have that scene like and maybe ladies cover your\n\n32:27.280 --> 32:30.640\nears I don't know what's gonna offend you here but I would say don't I would\n\n32:30.640 --> 32:35.440\nsay I would say hit record when I say when I say cover your ears I just mean\n\n32:35.440 --> 32:39.680\nlike don't judge like I for a second if you will if I be candid for a second\n\n32:39.680 --> 32:45.520\nlike guys do like like we go through ups and downs and we do like like when we\n\n32:45.520 --> 32:50.440\nget our hearts broken we I think there is a tendency like to like we have these\n\n32:50.440 --> 32:53.240\nlike things we do especially when we're young and we're still learning how to\n\n32:53.240 --> 32:57.400\ninteract with people but go like we swing the other way you know like like\n\n32:57.400 --> 33:00.280\nlike like from whatever previous relationship like we think we're gonna\n\n33:00.280 --> 33:03.600\nfix things and I'm sure this is not totally exclusive to men but I'm just\n\n33:03.600 --> 33:07.560\ntalking to the guys because guys are kind of inherently you know we're\n\n33:07.560 --> 33:13.000\nmisogynistic we're inherently we love slash fear slash worship slash hate\n\n33:13.000 --> 33:17.560\ndespise these these these other creatures that we have so much power over us\n\n33:17.560 --> 33:20.600\nthat we don't understand we just want them to like us blah blah blah makes us\n\n33:20.600 --> 33:24.080\nbehave in all these fucked up ways we've been socialized not to share those\n\n33:24.080 --> 33:28.800\nfeelings cope with them connect those to the feelings that are also fucked up\n\n33:28.800 --> 33:31.440\nwith the other person and achieve that you don't start learning that stuff until\n\n33:31.440 --> 33:37.200\nyou're 44 and rich and already divorced and are like finally opening the hood a\n\n33:37.200 --> 33:42.040\nlittle more than two inches on the fucked up car that is your life so you\n\n33:42.040 --> 33:47.040\nyou keep me this very general forever for all man this is stuff you need time\n\n33:47.040 --> 33:51.440\nand money in the inclination to examine and I don't blame your average 40 year\n\n33:51.440 --> 33:56.280\nold guy that has a lot more work to do for not getting there wait this is a\n\n33:56.280 --> 33:59.680\ntangent I'm just saying here's here's what I'm saying in the crassist terms I'm\n\n33:59.680 --> 34:05.040\nlike if your first wife was like just like it was an American model and then\n\n34:05.040 --> 34:09.520\nyour second wife was a Russian model and then your third wife was a Russian model\n\n34:09.520 --> 34:15.520\nhere's what I'm assuming about the third marriage there's preconditions up the\n\n34:15.520 --> 34:21.240\nfucking darkest yin yang imaginable like because there's no other difference he\n\n34:21.240 --> 34:26.400\ndidn't didn't go to French model he didn't go to Japanese model like he went\n\n34:26.400 --> 34:32.320\nhe was like I like me those those those eastern block women and here's another\n\n34:32.320 --> 34:36.240\none I'm guaranteeing you there's some fucked up differences at the outset of\n\n34:36.240 --> 34:39.960\nthat relationship that result in those that face that she's making that that\n\n34:39.960 --> 34:42.720\nbroke your heart because you said oh yeah minded you of what you do at the\n\n34:42.720 --> 34:51.200\nApple store right Spencer said that's the face of a customer service rep so what\n\n34:51.200 --> 34:54.040\nyou know you do that you know you're smiling and they turn around and you're\n\n34:54.040 --> 35:04.240\nlike she's a hostage is the worst yeah anyways I mean I mean benefit of the\n\n35:04.240 --> 35:07.040\ndoubt I'm hoping that she doesn't want to live with Donald Trump because he's a\n\n35:07.040 --> 35:11.680\ngross perverted asshole and she wants to take care of Baron like you know like\n\n35:11.680 --> 35:17.520\nmaybe he needs special care or whatever and she doesn't want to do huh like I\n\n35:17.520 --> 35:21.440\nmean maybe she's an awesome mom who doesn't want to be involved in that\n\n35:21.440 --> 35:25.720\ncircus like I'm hoping that that's the case but one thing's for certain she\n\n35:25.720 --> 35:31.160\ndoesn't want to be around him and now we have to foot the goddamn bill and we\n\n35:31.160 --> 35:35.360\nhave to be around him I know it's like we're the we're the we're the most\n\n35:35.360 --> 35:41.080\nvictimized neighbor in the world to that fucked up relationship like the care\n\n35:41.080 --> 35:52.480\ntaker at the Overlook Hotel had it better Scatman Crothers dad he had a name\n\n35:52.480 --> 35:59.480\nthe the okay so okay so here's the thing so go ahead cap capitalist what do you\n\n35:59.480 --> 36:06.440\ncall it uh what do you call it activism consumer activism all right so uber we\n\n36:06.440 --> 36:12.240\nfucking the people spoke with their money and then he quit and then he he\n\n36:12.240 --> 36:15.440\npulled out of the thing that was egregiously like like oh I love Trump\n\n36:15.440 --> 36:20.480\nand I think maybe issued a statement that kind of disavowed he said I didn't\n\n36:20.480 --> 36:24.000\nwant this to be about politics it's wanted to be about being part of the\n\n36:24.000 --> 36:27.640\nthing and it hurt his bottom line and he and he fucked straight so the\n\n36:27.640 --> 36:30.160\nquestion is now I'm having a disagreement with Cody about this because\n\n36:30.160 --> 36:35.400\nshe's like oh you can reinstall uber now and I was like wait fuck him now\n\n36:35.400 --> 36:41.120\noff of this head like he'll be fine anyway like let him just drive all\n\n36:41.120 --> 36:46.520\nRepublicans around but but and I'll see you with the finish line but he was\n\n36:46.520 --> 36:49.600\nalready but but but she's got a point too though if you're if you if we\n\n36:49.600 --> 36:53.720\nactually want to if it's about you know it's not it's just about swatting and\n\n36:53.720 --> 36:56.600\nI don't know it's like a very interesting argument she's like oh you can take an\n\n36:56.600 --> 37:02.640\nuber now because he he got hit and acknowledged he got hit publicly and\n\n37:02.640 --> 37:07.520\nand and kowtowed to the will of the people what you don't want to do is\n\n37:07.520 --> 37:12.440\ncontinue to just grind his face into the dirt he I mean like I I don't want to\n\n37:12.440 --> 37:15.840\nsay things and be fake news about this but like it hasn't already been like a\n\n37:15.840 --> 37:20.000\nlot of like mistreatment of his workers I would say we should have stopped\n\n37:20.000 --> 37:25.160\nusing uber well before this because there's loads of sexual assault charges\n\n37:25.160 --> 37:32.960\nright his workers are really ill-treated guys really high-roaded me well no I mean\n\n37:32.960 --> 37:37.400\nthough because I just like being able to tip because I'm just like now I can\n\n37:37.400 --> 37:41.720\ngive him however many stars I want yeah yeah because I'm paying here's the weird\n\n37:41.720 --> 37:45.120\nthing about lift though that I know that I've switched and I'm not gonna go back\n\n37:45.120 --> 37:48.800\nI'm I've learned to cope with lift and and it's not as it's not as bad as it\n\n37:48.800 --> 37:54.240\nwas when I stopped using it yeah but it's like the form I just I'm never gonna\n\n37:54.240 --> 37:59.680\ngive you less than five stars unless you like like run my dog or something but if\n\n37:59.680 --> 38:02.920\nyou give less than five stars if you press left those five stars before you\n\n38:02.920 --> 38:08.640\nsubmit it says how can how can Rashida improve and but if you give five stars\n\n38:08.640 --> 38:12.120\nas tonight you know Rashida drove me here in a lift and then it you give five\n\n38:12.120 --> 38:17.280\nstars and it always then it says like what did you love about about Rashida\n\n38:17.280 --> 38:21.920\nI've never had that feedback thing like it's right there I mean do you not know\n\n38:21.920 --> 38:25.560\nlike I've only given less than five stars maybe two or three times ever and I\n\n38:25.560 --> 38:28.520\ntake lift all the time when I'm saying when you give five stars the question\n\n38:28.520 --> 38:32.200\nchanges from what would you improve to what did you love I'm saying I've never\n\n38:32.200 --> 38:36.400\ngotten that feedback loop thing we're like work they've never asked me tell\n\n38:36.400 --> 38:39.320\nme why you gave five stars or tell me why you didn't I've never seen that they\n\n38:39.320 --> 38:44.440\nprobably don't care about it yeah motherfucker it sounds like I don't\n\n38:44.440 --> 38:50.400\nsocial anxiety feature because yeah my point is like what do you tell me does\n\n38:50.400 --> 38:55.000\nanybody ever type anything like I start I was flirting with ironic things like\n\n38:55.000 --> 38:59.680\nlike like like like the stars in his eyes or like like but but I don't want to\n\n38:59.680 --> 39:04.320\nconfuse people I've never been asked to weigh in on why I've only said that you\n\n39:04.320 --> 39:07.680\nget to rate them and that's the end of the franchise all right well to tell you\n\n39:07.680 --> 39:11.680\nthe truth I thought that was gonna be a half hour of the show was talking about\n\n39:11.680 --> 39:17.680\nthat but now we're fucked it appears

here's\n\n58:05.440 --> 58:14.360\nhow cartoons work first you write them then you draw them for a really long\n\n58:14.360 --> 58:27.560\ntime everything needs to be on paper so you can see it so if all I do is write\n\n58:27.560 --> 58:44.320\nit and then put it on TV it'll look like a script instead of Rick and Morty what\n\n58:44.320 --> 58:59.600\nyou seem to like and when you tell me to stop being political and get back to\n\n58:59.600 --> 59:09.640\ndrawing it I don't try it I know it looks like I do that's called style those\n\n59:09.640 --> 59:33.400\nartists are still actually to go to school they're drawing it and they'll\n\n59:33.400 --> 59:40.680\nbe drawing it until they're done drawing it and then adult swimmel cheers\n\n59:40.680 --> 59:58.000\nwhen the air it's very much not my decision when the air things because\n\n59:58.000 --> 01:00:17.320\nremember because I don't control other things are on TV or not if I did we'd\n\n01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:24.160\nbe in season 9 of community and it would be 48 episodes a year and they would\n\n01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:32.680\nalso just be shows about me taking a shit I would I would be every show I would\n\n01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:37.760\nbecause I don't I'm gonna stop when you say stop I'm gonna fuck your mama like\n\n01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:46.160\nthe head of a mop a hip hop to the hip one day Superman team down he said I'm\n\n01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:55.280\nSuperman so comparatively you're a clown I said ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha\n\n01:00:55.280 --> 01:01:02.400\nSuperman got his woofers and tweeters out I said motherfucker democracy is gonna\n\n01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:13.640\nchout with your titties out around about I got the gout Superman ain't too much\n\n01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:21.640\nrich food, heavy creams and sauces. He thought he was impervious to them because he's Superman.\n\n01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:30.640\nA lot of people don't know. Totally normal internal digestive system. He can succumb to things like gout.\n\n01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:34.640\nA lot of people say gout is Superman's kryptonite.\n\n01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:49.640\nFrom a strictly dietary standpoint, however, gout can never actually kill him because he's...\n\n01:01:49.640 --> 01:02:05.640\nThey're drawing it.\n\n01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:21.640\nWhile they're drawing it, I'm making a million things and they take a long time to make. Spencer's killing it on Harmon Quest Season 2.\n\n01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:38.640\nI thought for a second that there was a little bit of it that was going to be bad. I wouldn't set him up by saying that.\n\n01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:43.640\nI'm so excited about Harmon Quest. I'm not saying... There's nothing... Don't let that show up in an article where it's like,\n\n01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:51.640\nhere's why Rick and Morty's late. Dan's excited about Harmon Quest. It's not related. They're drawing it. They have to draw the things.\n\n01:02:51.640 --> 01:03:01.640\nI will say and did say. The reason it was late, the reason they got a late start drawing it is because I am fucking slow and shitty and unpredictable as a writer.\n\n01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:14.640\nThe buck stops here with that. I'm done with that part. You can't now tell me to go faster. It doesn't make any sense. I confessed to my crimes after it was too late to make me change.\n\n01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:19.640\nYou're yelling at the audience. You're yelling at them.\n\n01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:32.640\nAnyways, it's 9-11 probably. Is it 9-11? It looks like 9-10. Moment of silence for the bowling green massacre victims.\n\n01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:43.640\nOh my God. Are you booing my mainstream political jokes?\n\n01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:53.640\nI could have stopped it. Do you have any actual political jokes? Let's do a Dan Harmon joke corner where you tell a joke.\n\n01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:59.640\nIt doesn't have to be political. Any just proper joke joke.\n\n01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:01.640\nOh, I thought it was a political joke.\n\n01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:03.640\nOh, if you got one, lay it on us.\n\n01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:17.640\nKelly and Conway walks into a chamber. That's how all good jokes start.\n\n01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:23.640\nAnd there's a vortex in it.\n\n01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:32.640\nA door to the south.\n\n01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:39.640\nAnd there's other people in there. She wants to save them because they're Nazis or something.\n\n01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:50.640\nAnd so she says, I'll tell you what, you guys run and I'll put the vortex where my soul should be.\n\n01:04:50.640 --> 01:05:01.640\nAnd they say, but how will you keep your physical form from desiccating in this really on the nose evil way?\n\n01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:07.640\nHow will you keep yourself from looking like an over the top sorceress?\n\n01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:24.640\nAs if there's like weird permanent mascara tears going down the lines where your veins supply blood to your eyeballs from a heart that may just be a black rock that glows and pulses rather than beating.\n\n01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:28.640\nAnd she's like, I don't know. I'll just deal with it.\n\n01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:34.640\nAnd they run, all the Nazis run, and they're like, yay, we're free. We made it out of that chamber where there was a vortex.\n\n01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:37.640\nAnd she's like, I made it too.\n\n01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:38.640\nAnd they're like, but you...\n\n01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:45.640\nBy the way, if you guys have heard this, you can stop them at any time.\n\n01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:50.640\nNo, but I don't have any political jokes.\n\n01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:54.640\nI didn't mean to stop you.\n\n01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:59.640\nIt's really hard not to make fun of Kelly in Conway's appearance because you, but it's like, it's like one of those weird...\n\n01:05:59.640 --> 01:06:01.640\nShe looks like the lead singer of Hannai Rocks.\n\n01:06:01.640 --> 01:06:06.640\nIt's a catch-22 because you're like, you know what? Part of this is you want to be woke, you want to be on the right team.\n\n01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:09.640\nIt's like, we want to live in a world where you're...\n\n01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:13.640\nSo you're using tools that the enemy uses to just go like, oh, she's an ugly woman.\n\n01:06:13.640 --> 01:06:16.640\nLike, well, that's not really the point. It's just more like she looks evil.\n\n01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:23.640\nYeah. No, the president of the United States, fat and feminine, everything possible, shamed everybody.\n\n01:06:23.640 --> 01:06:28.640\nWe're allowed to say he has a giant ass and she looks like the lead singer of Hannai Rocks.\n\n01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:31.640\nYeah. But you can hear it's not going over well.\n\n01:06:31.640 --> 01:06:35.640\nBecause they don't look... Just look up the lead singer of Hannai Rocks.\n\n01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:40.640\nIt's like picture pages, like there's supplemental material to our entertainment.\n\n01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:47.640\nThere was this thing called picture pages starring a man that turned out to be a famous rapist.\n\n01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:51.640\nHe was so famous for rape.\n\n01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:54.640\nWell, I'm saying he turned out he ended up a famous...\n\n01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:56.640\nMore famous for that than pudding.\n\n01:06:56.640 --> 01:06:57.640\nYeah.\n\n01:06:57.640 --> 01:06:59.640\nYou got to admit.\n\n01:06:59.640 --> 01:07:00.640\nYeah.\n\n01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:06.640\nHe's the second-least-powerful rapist in America right now.\n\n01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:10.640\nWho's the least-powerful rapist in America?\n\n01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:12.640\nSecond-most, I meant.\n\n01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:13.640\nOh, okay. There we go.\n\n01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:15.640\nLet's check in with Spencer and see what's going on in China.\n\n01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:19.640\nHey, guys. I got these pickles.\n\n01:07:19.640 --> 01:07:21.640\nWe can't carry on.\n\n01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:22.640\nWhy did you bring pickles?\n\n01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:23.640\nThey're great.\n\n01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:24.640\nWhere did you get the pickles?\n\n01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:26.640\nFrom Artisan Cheese Gallery.\n\n01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:28.640\nSpencer's into pickles now.\n\n01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:32.640\nHey, go to Baller Hardware. They sell pickles at the hardware store.\n\n01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:33.640\nNo, they don't.\n\n01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:36.640\nThey sell pickles at the hardware store, and I went,\n\n01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:39.640\nwhy are you selling pickles at the hardware store?\n\n01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:42.640\nAnd they said, because they're fucking good, man.\n\n01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:46.640\nBaller Hardware, let me try some of these pickles.\n\n01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:51.640\nAnd I finished the jar. They're good, man.\n\n01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:52.640\nThat sounds great.\n\n01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:54.640\nYou got to get these pickles, man.\n\n01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:58.640\nAre they their own brand of pickles, the hardware store people?\n\n01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:01.640\nNo.\n\n01:08:01.640 --> 01:08:04.640\nThey're just name brand pickles, and they stock?\n\n01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:06.640\nNo, they're not name brand.\n\n01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:11.640\nI guess they're made in Silver Lake by a friend of the guy who owns the hardware store.\n\n01:08:11.640 --> 01:08:12.640\nOh, that's awesome.\n\n01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:15.640\nSo I can go get some keys made by some light bulbs.\n\n01:08:15.640 --> 01:08:16.640\nGet some pickles.\n\n01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:17.640\nGet some pickles.\n\n01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:18.640\nGet some pickles.\n\n01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:19.640\nThis sounds like one-stop shopping.\n\n01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:20.640\nAnd leave.\n\n01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:25.640\nYeah, they got the small baby pickles, and then they got the larger ones, too.\n\n01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:26.640\nSo you really are...\n\n01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:29.640\nI get one of each.\n\n01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:32.640\nSpencer, can I try one of your pickles?\n\n01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:35.640\nYeah, they're in the back. I bet Steve could bring them up.\n\n01:08:35.640 --> 01:08:36.640\nCan you bring out these pickles?\n\n01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:38.640\nSteve, would you bring out the goddamn pickles?\n\n01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:43.640\nYou really are getting into home improvement, which is funny, because when I got fired from community,\n\n01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:45.640\nI started hanging shelves and shit.\n\n01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:49.640\nIt was like some weird impulse, and are we allowed to talk about the fact?\n\n01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:51.640\nWell, it's all over the place, if I know what you're talking about.\n\n01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:55.640\nYour relationship with Lego has reached a conclusion, and now you're putting up shelves.\n\n01:08:55.640 --> 01:08:57.640\nThat's what I did after community.\n\n01:08:57.640 --> 01:09:04.640\nI had a lot of errands that I've been putting off, and I had to leave Lego to put up some shelves.\n\n01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:06.640\nDo my laundry. What do we got here?\n\n01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:08.640\nThere's ones that are peppers and ones that are pickles.\n\n01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:09.640\nOh, these are fucking delicious.\n\n01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:11.640\nRight. They're so good.\n\n01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:12.640\nDid you just eat a pepper or a pickle?\n\n01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:14.640\nI think that was a pickle one he grabbed.\n\n01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:15.640\nGive me some of them.\n\n01:09:15.640 --> 01:09:17.640\nThat's a pickle. It's almost like a bread and butter pickle.\n\n01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:18.640\nGive me some of them.\n\n01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:19.640\nYeah, it's the only thing that's a sweet pickle.\n\n01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:20.640\nGive me some of them.\n\n01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:21.640\nOh, God, I'm joy.\n\n01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:23.640\nI mean, I would put that on a sandwich, or I just eat them.\n\n01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:24.640\nOh.\n\n01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:25.640\nRight, you just eat them straight.\n\n01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:26.640\nThey're great.\n\n01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:28.640\nI want to eat some of these pickles.\n\n01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:32.640\nAll right. Is there anyone in the audience?\n\n01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:33.640\nThey're spicy, too.\n\n01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:34.640\nYeah, they're spicy, too.\n\n01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:36.640\nI want to eat some pickles.\n\n01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:37.640\nGet a pickle.\n\n01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:39.640\nPeople pay $10 for this show.\n\n01:09:39.640 --> 01:09:40.640\nOh, my God.\n\n01:09:40.640 -->

01:10:38.640\nwho's been at, like, more than, like, five protests?\n\n01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:39.640\nNobody.\n\n01:10:39.640 --> 01:10:40.640\nWow.\n\n01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:41.640\nFour protests.\n\n01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:42.640\nWell, that's important to know, too.\n\n01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:44.640\nLike, we're all, I mean, you guys are like me.\n\n01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:49.640\nLike, we've entered new times where, like, lower the number.\n\n01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:53.640\nWhat about a woman that was, uh, women here that were at the woman's march?\n\n01:10:53.640 --> 01:10:54.640\nOh, you're just coming up.\n\n01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:56.640\nYou didn't raise your hand, but you're, okay.\n\n01:10:56.640 --> 01:10:57.640\nNo, no, it's fine.\n\n01:10:57.640 --> 01:11:00.640\nAnd you definitely, I don't, yeah, you look like a protester.\n\n01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:01.640\nCome on up.\n\n01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:02.640\nUh, yeah.\n\n01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:03.640\nWhat's your name?\n\n01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:04.640\nHarry.\n\n01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:05.640\nHarry?\n\n01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:06.640\nOkay.\n\n01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:07.640\nIt's Harry, everybody.\n\n01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:08.640\nHey, everyone.\n\n01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:10.640\nDo you want a pickle?\n\n01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:13.640\nNo, I actually really don't like pickles.\n\n01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:14.640\nI will take a.\n\n01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:15.640\nYou'll love these pickles.\n\n01:11:15.640 --> 01:11:18.640\nThese pickles are, these pickles are pretty good.\n\n01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:21.640\nHey, cats, everyone thinks I'll love their cat.\n\n01:11:21.640 --> 01:11:23.640\nEveryone thinks I'll love their pickles.\n\n01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:27.640\nWell, everyone's cats are bad, but these pickles are good.\n\n01:11:27.640 --> 01:11:30.640\nSo, Harry, these pickles are off the fucking deep end, Harry.\n\n01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:32.640\nTreat yourself to one of these pickles.\n\n01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:34.640\nI'm going to stick with no pickles.\n\n01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:37.640\nTake the pickle.\n\n01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:39.640\nI'm protesting these pickles.\n\n01:11:39.640 --> 01:11:40.640\nI'm protesting.\n\n01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:45.640\nDrink, drink, drink, drink, drink that dill juice.\n\n01:11:45.640 --> 01:11:49.640\nHarry, come on.\n\n01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:51.640\nYou fucking pussy.\n\n01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:53.640\nDrink that dill juice, man.\n\n01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:55.640\nNo, I mean, I'm definitely scared to drink that.\n\n01:11:55.640 --> 01:11:56.640\nNo, drink it.\n\n01:11:56.640 --> 01:11:57.640\nDrink that dill juice.\n\n01:11:57.640 --> 01:11:58.640\nThat dill juice.\n\n01:11:58.640 --> 01:12:00.640\nFucking Harry, drink it.\n\n01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:02.640\nFucking pussy, man.\n\n01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:05.640\nHarry's not drinking the dill juice.\n\n01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:07.640\nDrink that dill juice.\n\n01:12:07.640 --> 01:12:09.640\nNo.\n\n01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:10.640\nAll right.\n\n01:12:10.640 --> 01:12:11.640\nOn the graph.\n\n01:12:11.640 --> 01:12:12.640\nOn the graph.\n\n01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:15.640\nThe amount of laughs toward time spent on this bit.\n\n01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:20.640\nWe peaked, and now we're going to ride downhill into the next segment.\n\n01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:21.640\nHarry.\n\n01:12:21.640 --> 01:12:22.640\nYes.\n\n01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:24.640\nSo, it was my first protest.\n\n01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:25.640\nI had to be flown into it.\n\n01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:26.640\nI was also there.\n\n01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:27.640\nWere you there at the LAX?\n\n01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:28.640\nYeah.\n\n01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:30.640\nWhen we shut that shit down?\n\n01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:32.640\nArrivals and departures?\n\n01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:34.640\nI was also there like days prior and after.\n\n01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:36.640\nFuck you, high road.\n\n01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:38.640\nNo, this isn't for you, it's for them.\n\n01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:39.640\nYou got off on an airplane.\n\n01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:42.640\nI was flown in with luggage.\n\n01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:49.640\nI was like, hell no, we won't go, not until my dog sitter is off duty.\n\n01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:53.640\nI don't know if it's because some get more attraction than others on social media,\n\n01:12:53.640 --> 01:12:57.640\nbut people seem to arbitrarily choose when to go to things that are consistent.\n\n01:12:57.640 --> 01:13:01.640\nThe Women's March was a set thing that happened at a time on a day.\n\n01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:05.640\nLAX was like, we kind of need you here always because there's planes keep coming in\n\n01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:07.640\nand people keep being detained.\n\n01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:11.640\nIf you're trying to be there to just be a physical body of support,\n\n01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:14.640\nthat's always needed until this shit changes.\n\n01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:19.640\nWell, I'm going to skip over a topic that'll make me babble for too long\n\n01:13:19.640 --> 01:13:23.640\nand put my foot in my mouth, which is to hold the pin.\n\n01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:27.640\nI want to get back to this topic after the next one,\n\n01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:33.640\nwhich is white people need to go to protest more than other people.\n\n01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:39.640\nWhite people sitting at their keyboard at home are doing three times as much\n\n01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:44.640\nby not doing anything because society is unfair.\n\n01:13:44.640 --> 01:13:48.640\nI said I wouldn't talk about it, but put a pin in that.\n\n01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:50.640\nWhite people need to go to more protest.\n\n01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:53.640\nPut a pin in it, Harry!\n\n01:13:53.640 --> 01:13:57.640\nAnd move that pin in accordance with the LAPD's wishes every five minutes.\n\n01:13:57.640 --> 01:13:59.640\nThat's my next topic.\n\n01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:03.640\nI'm going to eat a fucking pickle.\n\n01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:06.640\nObviously, the LAPD is more experienced than any protestor out there.\n\n01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:09.640\nAs an organization, maybe not the actual cool cucumbers,\n\n01:14:09.640 --> 01:14:14.640\nthe very ethnically diverse cool cucumbers they put out on the front lines.\n\n01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:19.640\nAs human beings, I got to say, the first thing that hits your mind\n\n01:14:19.640 --> 01:14:24.640\nas a first-time protestor being there, I was like, I love these protestors\n\n01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:28.640\nand I love the LAPD. It was this weird thing.\n\n01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:33.640\nBut then throughout the evening, by the time I got home, I was like, oh, we got played.\n\n01:14:33.640 --> 01:14:36.640\nIt's like, oh, peaceful protest, peaceful protest.\n\n01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:38.640\nEveryone was so proud of how peaceful the protest was.\n\n01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:43.640\nWell, the protest was peaceful because the protest was run by the LAPD.\n\n01:14:43.640 --> 01:14:46.640\nAnd every time somebody started chanting, fuck the police,\n\n01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:50.640\neverybody would go like, peaceful protest, peaceful protest.\n\n01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:53.640\nWe wouldn't want anyone to get arrested, tear gassed, all these things.\n\n01:14:53.640 --> 01:14:59.640\nBut it's really tough because basically the protestors ended up making a deal with the LAPD.\n\n01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:02.640\nThey were in constant contact with them, which I thought was a glorious thing.\n\n01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:04.640\nThere is a positivity to that, right?\n\n01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:10.640\nThere is a positive message that that sends, especially when the cops aren't the ones holding the detainees.\n\n01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:12.640\nI know you're asking, you're going like, damn, what is your question?\n\n01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:13.640\nNo, not at all.\n\n01:15:13.640 --> 01:15:16.640\nBut the LAPD isn't in charge of the detainees.\n\n01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:23.640\nAnd so they're working with them, cooperating with them.\n\n01:15:23.640 --> 01:15:26.640\nIt actually does provide these spine-tingling opportunities to be like,\n\n01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:29.640\nhey, maybe you guys should be over here too.\n\n01:15:29.640 --> 01:15:33.640\nYou are all like a rainbow of people descended from, you know,\n\n01:15:33.640 --> 01:15:36.640\nwhose family tree goes up two feet without an immigrant in it.\n\n01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:39.640\nYou're just wearing riot gear because that's your job.\n\n01:15:39.640 --> 01:15:40.640\nLike, get over here.\n\n01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:42.640\nAnd it's like, there's some moments where it was like, they might do it.\n\n01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:47.640\nI saw an airport cop, technically not LAPD. I forget the exact distinctions there.\n\n01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:51.640\nBut he cried when one of the detainees got released.\n\n01:15:51.640 --> 01:15:54.640\nAnd then I called him on it and he quickly got really macho about it and like wiped his tears out.\n\n01:15:54.640 --> 01:15:57.640\nChurch took some, Jeff's girlfriend took some great pictures of,\n\n01:15:57.640 --> 01:16:01.640\nshe could just be church, it doesn't have to be Jeff's girlfriend.\n\n01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:05.640\nWhat a fucking horrible society this is.\n\n01:16:05.640 --> 01:16:07.640\nShe loves pickles.\n\n01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:11.640\nShe got there too late in the game to like, if she had been there,\n\n01:16:11.640 --> 01:16:12.640\nshe's an amazing photographer.\n\n01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:17.640\nLike, nothing makes you realize more than photos,\n\n01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:21.640\nlike the history that we're living and you see it because it looks like Time Magazine.\n\n01:16:21.640 --> 01:16:22.640\nLet's bring church up.\n\n01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:23.640\nShe's sitting right here.\n\n01:16:23.640 --> 01:16:28.640\nChurch over at Cassandra Church.\n\n01:16:28.640 --> 01:16:33.640\nThe pictures that you took of that young lady who had like,\n\n01:16:33.640 --> 01:16:38.640\nshe decided to focus her emotional energy on one cop as if that itself were a weapon,\n\n01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:41.640\nlike a quote-unquote weapon, it's not destructive.\n\n01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:46.640\nShe was just, that was probably both a tactic and a very sincere thing\n\n01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:48.640\nbecause she was unmistakably sincere.\n\n01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:50.640\nAnd the cop, you said, well, you describe it.\n\n01:16:50.640 --> 01:16:52.640\nWell, it was when I first got there.\n\n01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:56.640\nAnd as you say, you know, they were in the street for a little while\n\n01:16:56.640 --> 01:16:58.640\nand then bringing people back up onto the sidewalk.\n\n01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:03.640\nAnd at this point, this is when all the police started pushing everybody back up onto the sidewalk.\n\n01:17:03.640 --> 01:17:08.640\nAnd this one particular girl caught my eye because as a photographer,\n\n01:17:08.640 --> 01:17:13.640\nI pushed my way to the front to try to get a view of everyone facing the police.\n\n01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:18.640\nAnd this one girl was just glued on this guy.\n\n01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:21.640\nAnd she had just tears, like, rolling down her face.\n\n01:17:21.640 --> 01:17:28.640\nAnd her sign said, like, Syria, Yemen, Iran, welcome here with a heart.\n\n01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:32.640\nShe was sobbing and sobbing and sobbing.\n\n01:17:32.640 --> 01:17:35.640\nAnd she was leaning off the curb practically onto an officer\n\n01:17:35.640 --> 01:17:38.640\nwho just kind of, like, leaned back and acted like I wasn't doing it\n\n01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:41.640\nbecause he could see what I saw and what I was trying to photograph.\n\n01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:42.640\nThey were being very nice to photographers.\n\n01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:44.640\nThey were being incredibly nice to photographers.\n\n01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:47.640\nAt one point, I was on an overpass looking down at these guys\n\n01:17:47.640 --> 01:17:52.640\nand they were smiling and waving and laughing and taking photos of me with their phones.\n\n01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:54.640\nAnd then they were all just on Instagram.\n\n01:17:54.640 --> 01:17:56.640\nThey were hanging out. They were fine.\n\n01:17:56.640 --> 01:17:58.640\nThere was absolutely no problem.\n\n01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:02.640\nI couldn't hear what was being said between the girl and the officer in front of her,\n\n01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:06.640\nbut he was whispering to her and trying to calm her down.\n\n01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:12.640\nAnd they were having some conversation that I couldn't hear from where I was standing.\n\n01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:14.640\nBut he seemed to be consoling her.\n\n01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:19.640\nRight. She was pleading something with him and trying to get him to understand\n\n01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:21.640\nand from what I could tell by their gestures.\n\n01:18:21.640 --> 01:18:23.640\nProbably something along the lines of, I'm just doing my job.\n\n01:18:23.640 --> 01:18:26.640\nRight. And he's probably saying something like, I know I understand and I'm just doing my job.\n\n01:18:26.640 --> 01:18:28.640\nLike, okay, just stay back on the curb.\n\n01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:33.640\nAnd that could be the most important interaction that you have with police\n\n01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:35.640\nis getting them to admit that they're just doing their job,\n\n01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:39.640\nreminding them of that the whole time because that means they don't have to be mad.\n\n01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:43.640\nThey don't have to be, but on the flip side of that,\n\n01:18:43.640 --> 01:18:47.640\nso that's why I wanted to have a hanky face as now I call them.\n\n01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:50.640\nBecause I was like looking around like, these hanky faces,\n\n01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:54.640\nare the hankies for anonymity or tear gas?\n\n01:18:54.640 --> 01:18:57.640\nPeople have their own reasons for them.\n\n01:18:57.640 --> 01:18:58.640\nSo a lot of us just...\n\n01:18:58.640 --> 01:19:04.640\nThere's also an argument, I can't defend it for various reasons or like object it to it.\n\n01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:09.640\nThere's some articles going around about how like masking up is a form of white privilege\n\n01:19:09.640 --> 01:19:12.640\nbecause if you're a white person then you still blend into the crowd\n\n01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:17.640\nwhereas like if there's only a few people of color at the thing, they're easier to identify.\n\n01:19:17.640 --> 01:19:19.640\nI didn't even follow, I didn't track that at all.\n\n01:19:19.640 --> 01:19:23.640\nIt's just some 2017 internet race commentary.\n\n01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:27.640\nI would say at this age, I think there's probably, it's rooted like masking up is probably...\n\n01:19:27.640 --> 01:19:29.640\nIt's rooted in anonymity.\n\n01:19:29.640 --> 01:19:30.640\nOkay, okay.\n\n01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:32.640\nBecause it's not going to filter out.\n\n01:19:32.640 --> 01:19:33.640\nNo, not at all.\n\n01:19:33.640 --> 01:19:35.640\nCertain things will, like the Home Depot guy who I also saw,\n\n01:19:35.640 --> 01:19:38.640\nlike his would have helped out a bit.\n\n01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:43.640\nBut yeah, I mean if they throw tear gas, your sunglasses and fabric aren't going to do shit.\n\n01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:47.640\nSo before church got there, this is what happened,\n\n01:19:47.640 --> 01:19:50.640\nwhich I think this could be a microcosm of what we're all facing,\n\n01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:53.640\nif we're all going to be protesting and marching, it's like this is a really difficult thing.\n\n01:19:53.640 --> 01:19:55.640\nBecause there was an exhilaration in the air,\n\n01:19:55.640 --> 01:19:59.640\nand part of the pride on the part of the protesters was in no uncertain terms\n\n01:19:59.640 --> 01:20:03.640\nthe fact that we were working in what you have to call cooperation with the LAPD.\n\n01:20:03.640 --> 01:20:05.640\nThat felt like a triumph.\n\n01:20:05.640 --> 01:20:09.640\nNow you're dealing with a police department that has been at a million of these.\n\n01:20:09.640 --> 01:20:13.640\nAnd they, and so, and you, but on the other hand,\n\n01:20:13.640 --> 01:20:17.640\nall of these individual police officers are human beings as are the protesters.\n\n01:20:17.640 --> 01:20:23.640\nBut when I get home and I see basically that the protest got successfully broken up, you know,\n\n01:20:23.640 --> 01:20:27.640\nand I look back and it was like there was this moment where we were all standing\n\n01:20:27.640 --> 01:20:33.640\nand blocking the upper concourse, and one of the megaphone people said,\n\n01:20:33.640 --> 01:20:39.640\nyou know, here's the deal, the cops are saying so far we haven't broken the law.\n\n01:20:39.640 --> 01:20:42.640\nBecause they haven't issued a disperse order.\n\n01:20:42.640 --> 01:20:45.640\nWhen they issue a disperse order, we have a decision to make.\n\n01:20:45.640 --> 01:20:50.640\nAre we going to become criminals and turn this into a thing\n\n01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:55.640\nthat's going to end up being a news item about how we were criminals\n\n01:20:55.640 --> 01:20:57.640\nand how the crime had to be put down?\n\n01:20:57.640 --> 01:21:01.640\nAlternatively, they've offered us a deal.\n\n01:21:01.640 --> 01:21:09.640\nThey've said that we can stand on the sidewalk for 15 minutes or 30 minutes\n\n01:21:09.640 --> 01:21:13.640\nand then disrupt for 10 minutes and then do that in alternation.\n\n01:21:13.640 --> 01:21:22.640\nAnd there was a pause and then someone called out, 15, 15 minutes, 20, 20, 15\n\n01:21:22.640 --> 01:21:29.640\nand it turned to the price is right about how we got the nuts here.\n\n01:21:29.640 --> 01:21:32.640\nI'm not disparaging that.\n\n01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:34.640\nI'm just pointing out the absurdity of it.\n\n01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:40.640\nIt's not because what happened was a wedge got driven in between the people\n\n01:21:40.640 --> 01:21:48.640\nthat have done this before and were not necessarily hoping things would deteriorate\n\n01:21:48.640 --> 01:21:52.640\nbut at the same time probably that were prepared for it.\n\n01:21:52.640 --> 01:21:55.640\nAnd that's always going to be a smaller group.\n\n01:21:55.640 --> 01:21:59.640\nAnd so that was a really, that is a tactic, right?\n\n01:21:59.640 --> 01:22:03.640\nBecause they, rather than bother throwing tear gas at a large group of people\n\n01:22:03.640 --> 01:22:07.640\nthat feel solidified to stay in communication with them\n\n01:22:07.640 --> 01:22:10.640\nand to say, oh, we love Shayguvara.\n\n01:22:10.640 --> 01:22:12.640\nShayguvara is your spokesman.\n\n01:22:12.640 --> 01:22:13.640\nWe just talked to Shayguvara.\n\n01:22:13.640 --> 01:22:15.640\nShay, tell your people what we're telling them.\n\n01:22:15.640 --> 01:22:19.640\nWe're telling you, you can have free bananas if you give us half of your guns.\n\n01:22:19.640 --> 01:22:26.640\nAnd then there's like, all of this stuff starts, you foment like a conversation among the protesters.\n\n01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:28.640\nBefore that, there was no conversation.\n\n01:22:28.640 --> 01:22:34.640\nI feel like there were a couple of things that made that specific.\n\n01:22:34.640 --> 01:22:40.640\nOne, it was, like church, you were at the Ferguson protests here in LA.\n\n01:22:40.640 --> 01:22:42.640\nYeah, and it was a very different thing.\n\n01:22:42.640 --> 01:22:47.640\nIf it was 2000 black people at the airport, I think it would have been different.\n\n01:22:47.640 --> 01:22:50.640\nAnd also, if it weren't an airport, it would have been different.\n\n01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:56.640\nThey don't want to start putting chemical agents out into an airport.\n\n01:22:56.640 --> 01:22:58.640\nBut all that is to say that we had the leverage.\n\n01:22:58.640 --> 01:22:59.640\nWe had the airport shut down.\n\n01:22:59.640 --> 01:23:01.640\nI don't know what our leverage translated to.\n\n01:23:01.640 --> 01:23:04.640\nBut sorry, go ahead, Harry.\n\n01:23:04.640 --> 01:23:07.640\nThere's also a difference between a protest like the Women's March where it's organized.\n\n01:23:07.640 --> 01:23:08.640\nIt's in the daytime.\n\n01:23:08.640 --> 01:23:11.640\nThey block off streets and everybody knows where it's going to be\n\n01:23:11.640 --> 01:23:14.640\nand where the people will be going generally and what the plan is.\n\n01:23:14.640 --> 01:23:15.640\nRight.\n\n01:23:15.640 --> 01:23:19.640\nVersus at night people just taking to the street because they're angry\n\n01:23:19.640 --> 01:23:23.640\nor people showing up to a place like the airport that already has high security.\n\n01:23:23.640 --> 01:23:24.640\nOkay, so Harry...\n\n01:23:24.640 --> 01:23:28.640\nSo the reaction is completely different by a police force coming out to try to contain\n\n01:23:28.640 --> 01:23:30.640\nand make sure that that's under control.\n\n01:23:30.640 --> 01:23:32.640\nAnd where there's multiple law enforcement agencies.\n\n01:23:32.640 --> 01:23:33.640\nRight.\n\n01:23:33.640 --> 01:23:35.640\nWhat I'm wondering is then what was...\n\n01:23:35.640 --> 01:23:38.640\nBecause what happened was there were some hardcore elements that were like,\n\n01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:40.640\nno, then nothing happens.\n\n01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:41.640\nThis is how they drive a wedge.\n\n01:23:41.640 --> 01:23:42.640\nAnd then there were...\n\n01:23:42.640 --> 01:23:44.640\nLike, here I am, 44.\n\n01:23:44.640 --> 01:23:45.640\nI got...\n\n01:23:45.640 --> 01:23:46.640\nI'm hungry.\n\n01:23:46.640 --> 01:23:48.640\nMy dogs are about to start pissing in the house.\n\n01:23:48.640 --> 01:23:50.640\nI've been there for five hours.\n\n01:23:50.640 --> 01:23:52.640\nLike, I didn't want...\n\n01:23:52.640 --> 01:23:54.640\nThe last thing I wanted to do is be a pussy.\n\n01:23:54.640 --> 01:23:55.640\nBut...\n\n01:23:55.640 --> 01:23:57.640\nYou didn't see the girl who brought burritos?\n\n01:23:57.640 --> 01:23:59.640\nNo, there was plenty of burritos.\n\n01:23:59.640 --> 01:24:01.640\nYou left right before the burrito guy came out.\n\n01:24:01.640 --> 01:24:03.640\nShe brought a bunch of fucking burritos.\n\n01:24:03.640 --> 01:24:05.640\nTo the extent that I'm up in the air,\n\n01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:09.640\nlike, a situation got created where now conversations are starting to happen.\n\n01:24:09.640 --> 01:24:10.640\nLike, logic was invited.\n\n01:24:10.640 --> 01:24:18.640\nAnd I remember distinctly the moment where I felt at peace with stepping off of the street\n\n01:24:18.640 --> 01:24:21.640\nand under the sidewalk, i.e. basically surrendering.\n\n01:24:21.640 --> 01:24:24.640\nThe moment where I felt that that was okay,\n\n01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:27.640\nwhere I wouldn't then go home and hate myself for giving in,\n\n01:24:27.640 --> 01:24:31.640\nbecause there were, like, only a couple of people left who were arguing with each other.\n\n01:24:31.640 --> 01:24:37.640\nAnd one of them was screaming at the ones who wanted to stay and sit and get arrested.\n\n01:24:37.640 --> 01:24:40.640\nIt's not about you!\n\n01:24:40.640 --> 01:24:41.640\nAnd she's not...\n\n01:24:41.640 --> 01:24:43.640\nThere was this messaging that was put into it.\n\n01:24:43.640 --> 01:24:47.640\nIt was like, do we want the detainees to be in the newspaper?\n\n01:24:47.640 --> 01:24:48.640\nNewspaper.\n\n01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:49.640\nDo it...\n\n01:24:49.640 --> 01:24:50.640\nDo whatever.\n\n01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:54.640\nThe huff-posed laser beam, the hologram, the pokemons.\n\n01:24:54.640 --> 01:24:57.640\nDo we want the story to be about the detainees,\n\n01:24:57.640 --> 01:25:01.640\nor do we want it to be about how a bunch of hippies got stun gunned at the airport?\n\n01:25:01.640 --> 01:25:02.640\nOkay, so now...\n\n01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:05.640\nSo at that moment, I was like, here...\n\n01:25:05.640 --> 01:25:08.640\nI've done all the talking, but I want to be...\n\n01:25:08.640 --> 01:25:12.640\nLike, here's the thing, first protest, 44 years old,\n\n01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:15.640\nlike, so used to always doing the wrong thing.\n\n01:25:15.640 --> 01:25:17.640\nLike, I always, like, think that I'm like,\n\n01:25:17.640 --> 01:25:21.640\noh, sounds like this, and then I'll be so embarrassed.\n\n01:25:21.640 --> 01:25:24.640\nThat's when I was like, okay, I now have permission to step on the sidewalk\n\n01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:27.640\nbecause this very passionate young woman is going, like, it's not about you,\n\n01:25:27.640 --> 01:25:29.640\nand she's talking to, like, four or five people,\n\n01:25:29.640 --> 01:25:35.640\nand, like, I don't know, and I won't know until someone else tells me\n\n01:25:35.640 --> 01:25:39.640\nwhether it's the right thing to do to sit here, sit down, or leave.\n\n01:25:39.640 --> 01:25:43.640\nI was like, what if I undercut the fucking cause?\n\n01:25:43.640 --> 01:25:47.640\nIt was like, a community creator and famous fat guy.\n\n01:25:47.640 --> 01:25:52.640\nIt's like, what if that ends up being some kind of counter-messaging or whatever.\n\n01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:55.640\nSo now talk to me, tell me what to do.\n\n01:25:55.640 --> 01:25:58.640\nI think, well, sort of contrary to that request,\n\n01:25:58.640 --> 01:26:02.640\nI think it's important no matter which side of an issue you're on,\n\n01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:06.640\nnot to tell other people protesting the same thing, how to protest,\n\n01:26:06.640 --> 01:26:11.640\nwhether that means if someone wants to get arrested for their cause,\n\n01:26:11.640 --> 01:26:13.640\nlet them make that decision.\n\n01:26:13.640 --> 01:26:18.640\nAnd if someone wants to chant a chant and hold a sign,\n\n01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:20.640\nlet them make that decision.\n\n01:26:20.640 --> 01:26:24.640\nI think it's important to know what you're trying to accomplish\n\n01:26:24.640 --> 01:26:29.640\nand if what you're doing is everything you could be doing to accomplish that.\n\n01:26:29.640 --> 01:26:36.640\nSo, like, if you want to make real change in government policy,\n\n01:26:36.640 --> 01:26:41.640\nholding a sign and chanting a chant isn't going to do that.\n\n01:26:41.640 --> 01:26:45.640\nBecause they've now incorporated that into their system if they hadn't already 60 years ago.\n\n01:26:45.640 --> 01:26:49.640\nAnd it's just like, that's you being, by going to the airport,\n\n01:26:49.640 --> 01:26:55.640\nyou're being a physical body supporting a message as well as actual people who are detained.\n\n01:26:55.640 --> 01:27:02.640\nBut, like, if you have any illusions that what you're doing in that is really affecting larger change,\n\n01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:05.640\nwhich I think was one thing some people gave the women's march kind of a bad rep for this,\n\n01:27:05.640 --> 01:27:08.640\nbut I thought it was cool that they almost owned up to, like,\n\n01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:11.640\nwe don't have a list of demands, we just want to make sure you know we're here\n\n01:27:11.640 --> 01:27:13.640\nand we're not fucking cool with this stuff.\n\n01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:15.640\nWhich I thought was so, that was the most important thing.\n\n01:27:15.640 --> 01:27:16.640\nYou could look at it either way.\n\n01:27:16.640 --> 01:27:19.640\nIt turned out body count was the thing that was important.\n\n01:27:19.640 --> 01:27:24.640\nIt was flesh scraping cement poured into the streets of every city around the world.\n\n01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:28.640\nThat really got to our enemy.\n\n01:27:28.640 --> 01:27:34.640\nSo, like, if you go to a protest and the police give you a directive,\n\n01:27:34.640 --> 01:27:38.640\nit's basically just up to you to assess what it is you're trying to do\n\n01:27:38.640 --> 01:27:43.640\nand if listening to that directive or disobeying it is going to further your cause.\n\n01:27:43.640 --> 01:27:48.640\nSo, like, if you're there just for moral support, maybe don't get arrested.\n\n01:27:48.640 --> 01:27:49.640\nOr do.\n\n01:27:49.640 --> 01:27:53.640\nLike, that's your choice, but it's not going to, if you get arrested,\n\n01:27:53.640 --> 01:27:58.640\nyou're not going to be able to be the body there showing your support.\n\n01:27:58.640 --> 01:28:04.640\nSo, what do you think? You were there, and so you were like, you know what, for what we've done,\n\n01:28:04.640 --> 01:28:10.640\nwe shut down the airport, LAX is not the epicenter of this, the LAPD is not in charge.\n\n01:28:10.640 --> 01:28:16.640\nYou thought it was cool to shrink back and continue to have a presence there.\n\n01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:20.640\nIt's kind of a picket line in the sense that it's like a physical reminder.\n\n01:28:20.640 --> 01:28:25.640\nYeah, it sort of becomes up to you also having been there for over a day already\n\n01:28:25.640 --> 01:28:28.640\nand to continue to be there. Like, those cops work long shifts.\n\n01:28:28.640 --> 01:28:31.640\nThey come to recognize people who are there enough.\n\n01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:36.640\nIf I'm going to continue to be there and do what I think is my best foot forward\n\n01:28:36.640 --> 01:28:40.640\nto help my cause or whatever, getting arrested doesn't help that.\n\n01:28:40.640 --> 01:28:43.640\nThese cops recognize me already as the guy who's been here all week.\n\n01:28:43.640 --> 01:28:47.640\nLike, it's not useful for me to step to them. I know they're not the enemy.\n\n01:28:47.640 --> 01:28:49.640\nHow much time have you spent out there at LAX?\n\n01:28:49.640 --> 01:28:51.640\nLike, you've been there for multiple days?\n\n01:28:51.640 --> 01:28:54.640\nYeah, yeah. I haven't been in a couple of days because at a certain point\n\n01:28:54.640 --> 01:28:56.640\nI was like, oh, I need to make rent money.\n\n01:28:56.640 --> 01:28:59.640\nBut I was there for like four or five days.\n\n01:28:59.640 --> 01:29:02.640\nNot sleeping there because I was like, I have a home to go to\n\n01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:05.640\nand I don't want to be more of a nuisance than by design.\n\n01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:08.640\nWell, I found a good tactic because we just got off a plane like Dan said.\n\n01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:13.640\nI had my suit, Vivienne Westwood's, that garment bag over my shoulder.\n\n01:29:13.640 --> 01:29:18.640\nAnd I'm dressed like me and there's a bunch of hippies.\n\n01:29:18.640 --> 01:29:22.640\nHarry, I know we all saw that dude that was kind of the Native American guy\n\n01:29:22.640 --> 01:29:25.640\nwith a drum that was just being the most punk rock dude in the world.\n\n01:29:25.640 --> 01:29:26.640\nThe tiny drum?\n\n01:29:26.640 --> 01:29:27.640\nYeah.\n\n01:29:27.640 --> 01:29:28.640\nHe was there a lot.\n\n01:29:28.640 --> 01:29:31.640\nThere was this guy dressed up like just this native, like, like, Inkin,\n\n01:29:31.640 --> 01:29:35.640\nI don't know what he was, just banging a drum right in the cops' faces\n\n01:29:35.640 --> 01:29:38.640\nand they didn't, like, they just let him do it. It was so cool.\n\n01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:40.640\nBecause, like, they don't give a shit.\n\n01:29:40.640 --> 01:29:45.640\nYeah, because he was just this great, like, drum major for the whole thing.\n\n01:29:45.640 --> 01:29:51.640\nBut there was a moment when the organizers of the protest at LAX were saying,\n\n01:29:51.640 --> 01:29:54.640\nokay, guys, are we need people upstairs and downstairs at the same time?\n\n01:29:54.640 --> 01:29:58.640\nSo if you guys are comfortable going upstairs, we want to spread this out.\n\n01:29:58.640 --> 01:30:00.640\nAlso, we need people inside to welcome the people coming out.\n\n01:30:00.640 --> 01:30:02.640\nSo let's make sure that we're all here and we're all there.\n\n01:30:02.640 --> 01:30:07.640\nSo, Church and I, I think Dan and Cody had just gone. You guys just split.\n\n01:30:07.640 --> 01:30:10.640\nAnd this is, like, oh, like, 10 p.m. and we got there, like, at five.\n\n01:30:10.640 --> 01:30:15.640\nWe went downstairs and we had to, it was time to go back into the street\n\n01:30:15.640 --> 01:30:19.640\nand disrupt things with the cops so we can go and be disruptive for 15 minutes.\n\n01:30:19.640 --> 01:30:24.640\nAnd, like, we can be off the sidewalk and be out in traffic and walking.\n\n01:30:24.640 --> 01:30:28.640\nYour next schedule, disruption, will be permitted in T-miners.\n\n01:30:28.640 --> 01:30:33.640\nRight-wingers are roasting you online for listening to cops just so everyone's aware.\n\n01:30:33.640 --> 01:30:36.640\nLike, if you go and watch a right-wing chat room where they're, like, periscoping the protest,\n\n01:30:36.640 --> 01:30:38.640\nthey're just like, look at these fucking idiots listening to police.\n\n01:30:38.640 --> 01:30:40.640\nLike, they don't know what they're doing.\n\n01:30:40.640 --> 01:30:42.640\nReally? The right-wing people say that?\n\n01:30:42.640 --> 01:30:44.640\nYeah, because they're like, oh, you think you're making a change,\n\n01:30:44.640 --> 01:30:47.640\nbut you're sitting here obeying cops, which I'm not.\n\n01:30:47.640 --> 01:30:50.640\nAlso, because they don't know the difference between a protest and a riot.\n\n01:30:50.640 --> 01:30:53.640\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:30:53.640 --> 01:30:59.640\nNow, hilariously, while it was happening, like, every 30 minutes, because it's LAX,\n\n01:30:59.640 --> 01:31:02.640\nhello, I'm Mayor Eric Garcetti.\n\n01:31:02.640 --> 01:31:06.640\nWhile Eric Garcetti is not at the airport.\n\n01:31:06.640 --> 01:31:10.640\nIt's really funny. There's, like, a guy painted blood red with a Native American drum\n\n01:31:10.640 --> 01:31:12.640\nin a cop's ear going, boom!\n\n01:31:12.640 --> 01:31:17.640\nBut we, like, this is democracy! This is what democracy looks like!\n\n01:31:17.640 --> 01:31:20.640\nAnd then it's like, hello, I'm Eric Garcetti.\n\n01:31:20.640 --> 01:31:23.640\nNot a good time, Eric.\n\n01:31:23.640 --> 01:31:29.640\nSo we were a small group of people going downstairs to block the downstairs traffic, too.\n\n01:31:29.640 --> 01:31:32.640\nAnd again, I feel bad about anybody that missed a plane or all that shit.\n\n01:31:32.640 --> 01:31:35.640\nIt's a bummer. But we were trying, there was a lot of people being detained,\n\n01:31:35.640 --> 01:31:40.640\nand we were trying, we were hoping that, like, being there was going to get all these people released.\n\n01:31:40.640 --> 01:31:45.640\nBut it turns out 25 did get released, and then during that time, 100 more people got detained.\n\n01:31:45.640 --> 01:31:47.640\nComplaints keep coming in.\n\n01:31:47.640 --> 01:31:51.640\nThat's the central issue of what's going on at LAX that I think needs to be remembered.\n\n01:31:51.640 --> 01:31:55.640\nLike, yes, there's a bigger picture of, like, Trump's executive orders in the large scale\n\n01:31:55.640 --> 01:31:57.640\nand overall policies about immigration.\n\n01:31:57.640 --> 01:32:01.640\nBut, like, specifically what's going on is people are being illegally detained\n\n01:32:01.640 --> 01:32:04.640\nand denied access to food, water, lawyers, family, like...\n\n01:32:04.640 --> 01:32:06.640\nHealthcare.\n\n01:32:06.640 --> 01:32:08.640\nThat's what's happening.\n\n01:32:08.640 --> 01:32:10.640\nElderly, it doesn't matter.\n\n01:32:10.640 --> 01:32:12.640\nNot even from just those seven countries.\n\n01:32:12.640 --> 01:32:15.640\nThey detained an Aero Mexico flight of, like, 100 passengers.\n\n01:32:15.640 --> 01:32:18.640\nA woman from Amsterdam, like, they're just...\n\n01:32:18.640 --> 01:32:20.640\nCBP is being crazy.\n\n01:32:20.640 --> 01:32:25.640\nLike, if you're a privileged white guy that has access to a garment bag,\n\n01:32:25.640 --> 01:32:27.640\nhere's a little tip.\n\n01:32:27.640 --> 01:32:28.640\nGo to a protest.\n\n01:32:28.640 --> 01:32:30.640\nLook like you just landed.\n\n01:32:30.640 --> 01:32:34.640\nLooks like you didn't show up to the protest, planning to be the protest.\n\n01:32:34.640 --> 01:32:35.640\nAnd have a garment bag.\n\n01:32:35.640 --> 01:32:38.640\nAnd you get to walk up to the police and talk to them,\n\n01:32:38.640 --> 01:32:43.640\nand they absolutely give you the full order of information that you don't get\n\n01:32:43.640 --> 01:32:46.640\nif you look like a protestor, because we all walked into the street\n\n01:32:46.640 --> 01:32:53.640\nand they all lined up, put their sticks up, their masks down on their helmet shields,\n\n01:32:53.640 --> 01:32:56.640\nand started marching us back off the street.\n\n01:32:56.640 --> 01:32:59.640\nAnd it's like, back on the curb, back on the sidewalk, back on the sidewalk.\n\n01:32:59.640 --> 01:33:01.640\nAnd they're like, we had a deal! We had a deal!\n\n01:33:01.640 --> 01:33:03.640\nAnd they're like, nope, you gotta get back on the street.\n\n01:33:03.640 --> 01:33:07.640\nSo I just sort of, I went out of the crowd because I'm a tall privileged white guy\n\n01:33:07.640 --> 01:33:08.640\nwith a garment bag.\n\n01:33:08.640 --> 01:33:10.640\nWe had a deal! We had a deal!\n\n01:33:10.640 --> 01:33:11.640\nChester's walking over.\n\n01:33:11.640 --> 01:33:14.640\nHonestly, all the men got off the street, all the women in the group\n\n01:33:14.640 --> 01:33:17.640\nstayed in this fucking street and were right the chin up to the cops.\n\n01:33:17.640 --> 01:33:19.640\nThey're like, no, we had a fucking deal.\n\n01:33:19.640 --> 01:33:21.640\nAnd the cops are like, back on the street, back on the street.\n\n01:33:21.640 --> 01:33:25.640\nSo I went down like Goldilocks and asked three different cops.\n\n01:33:25.640 --> 01:33:30.640\nHey, I put my suit garment over my shoulder like I'm a Kerry Grant.\n\n01:33:30.640 --> 01:33:33.640\nYou know, hey, hey, hey, hello, hello, matey.\n\n01:33:33.640 --> 01:33:35.640\nDo we change the deal? What's the difference now?\n\n01:33:35.640 --> 01:33:37.640\nWe had a deal! We had a deal!\n\n01:33:37.640 --> 01:33:39.640\nAnd you guys are going back on the curb, sir.\n\n01:33:39.640 --> 01:33:40.640\nI want you to know the cop.\n\n01:33:40.640 --> 01:33:41.640\nHey, I thought we had a deal.\n\n01:33:41.640 --> 01:33:44.640\n30 minutes on the sidewalk and 15 minutes in the road.\n\n01:33:44.640 --> 01:33:47.640\nAnd I wasn't really doing my bad Kerry Grant.\n\n01:33:47.640 --> 01:33:49.640\nYou're really committing to it.\n\n01:33:49.640 --> 01:33:53.640\nBut I was like, did things change? What's going on, man?\n\n01:33:53.640 --> 01:33:56.640\nI thought you told these kids there was a thing.\n\n01:33:56.640 --> 01:33:59.640\nAnd the second cop goes, now you gotta get back on the sidewalk, sir.\n\n01:33:59.640 --> 01:34:01.640\nAll the way down to the very last cop.\n\n01:34:01.640 --> 01:34:04.640\nI said, hey, wasn't there a thing going on?\n\n01:34:04.640 --> 01:34:06.640\nLike where there was like, we could be on the thing for 30 minutes\n\n01:34:06.640 --> 01:34:08.640\nand be out in the street for 50 minutes.\n\n01:34:08.640 --> 01:34:10.640\nAnd the guy kind of paused and looked around.\n\n01:34:10.640 --> 01:34:12.640\nAnd he goes, you have to be in the sidewalk.\n\n01:34:12.640 --> 01:34:13.640\nThe crosswalk.\n\n01:34:13.640 --> 01:34:14.640\nThe crosswalk.\n\n01:34:14.640 --> 01:34:15.640\nWe have to be on the crosswalk.\n\n01:34:15.640 --> 01:34:18.640\nAnd everyone, I ran back to the group.\n\n01:34:18.640 --> 01:34:20.640\nWe had a deal! We had a deal!\n\n01:34:20.640 --> 01:34:21.640\nEverybody! Everybody!\n\n01:34:21.640 --> 01:34:22.640\nWe had a deal!\n\n01:34:22.640 --> 01:34:23.640\nOver to the crosswalk!\n\n01:34:23.640 --> 01:34:24.640\nCrosswalk!\n\n01:34:24.640 --> 01:34:25.640\nGo to the crosswalk!\n\n01:34:25.640 --> 01:34:26.640\nGo to the crosswalk!\n\n01:34:26.640 --> 01:34:30.640\nAnd the cops, the LAPD, stood on both sides of the crosswalk\n\n01:34:30.640 --> 01:34:32.640\nand protected us and let us do our thing for a while.\n\n01:34:32.640 --> 01:34:37.640\nSo I couldn't believe at an airport how nice they were being about that deal.\n\n01:34:37.640 --> 01:34:39.640\nBecause I think it was because it's an airport.\n\n01:34:39.640 --> 01:34:42.640\nThey don't want to start shit when it doesn't need to be.\n\n01:34:42.640 --> 01:34:46.640\nThey weren't going to throw tear gas anywhere near the door to LA.\n\n01:34:46.640 --> 01:34:47.640\nExactly.\n\n01:34:47.640 --> 01:34:50.640\nWell, and I hope, and I think our hearts were filled with hope\n\n01:34:50.640 --> 01:34:54.640\nand perhaps naively perhaps were being laughed at for having this hope\n\n01:34:54.640 --> 01:34:59.640\nthat it's the LAPD, their jobs to serve and protect the people of Los Angeles,\n\n01:34:59.640 --> 01:35:02.640\nthese people, children of immigrants, immigrants themselves,\n\n01:35:02.640 --> 01:35:05.640\ndescending on this international hub of commerce,\n\n01:35:05.640 --> 01:35:09.640\nbecause LA fucking pumps and thrives with immigrant energy, foreign blood,\n\n01:35:09.640 --> 01:35:13.640\nthat's America, that all of those cops, also as civil servants,\n\n01:35:13.640 --> 01:35:16.640\nare like, I am here to protect your freedom of speech.\n\n01:35:16.640 --> 01:35:20.640\nI think we all felt that high of like, the cops are being chill right now\n\n01:35:20.640 --> 01:35:23.640\nbecause they know we're right and they want us to win.\n\n01:35:23.640 --> 01:35:27.640\nAnd that allowed us to make deals with them and get high off of that.\n\n01:35:27.640 --> 01:35:29.640\nOh, the teacher put an apple on my desk.\n\n01:35:29.640 --> 01:35:37.640\nI think, so I, one thing that's really important is that this sea of,\n\n01:35:37.640 --> 01:35:45.640\nthere's like 150 people in this room and this is a scientific, important statement,\n\n01:35:45.640 --> 01:35:49.640\nnot a shaming one, that absolutely nobody here yet,\n\n01:35:49.640 --> 01:35:55.640\nthis is like my predominantly white audience and certainly all of them,\n\n01:35:55.640 --> 01:36:00.640\nregardless of gender background, whatever, they're all nerds.\n\n01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:04.640\nThey're all like analytical thinkers and we've all been guilty of this\n\n01:36:04.640 --> 01:36:08.640\nwhere we sit and we're watching what's happening and you don't want to side\n\n01:36:08.640 --> 01:36:12.640\nwith a dirty, belligerent hippie anymore than you want to side with a fascist cop.\n\n01:36:12.640 --> 01:36:15.640\nLike you, your instinct, because you are like me,\n\n01:36:15.640 --> 01:36:18.640\nlike you're like, you want to be Han Solo, he's the smart one,\n\n01:36:18.640 --> 01:36:21.640\nhe's the logical one, you were an individualist.\n\n01:36:21.640 --> 01:36:26.640\nLike you, that's your American values, that's the way you express how you are.\n\n01:36:26.640 --> 01:36:29.640\nYou don't want to, you don't see any merit in joining a throng.\n\n01:36:29.640 --> 01:36:31.640\nWhat good could come of that?\n\n01:36:31.640 --> 01:36:36.640\nAnd I don't want to ever tell you what to do and I'm proud of the fact\n\n01:36:36.640 --> 01:36:39.640\nthat my audience has never protested.\n\n01:36:39.640 --> 01:36:45.640\nBut like, I'm now saying like, because this time is crucial, I'm 44,\n\n01:36:45.640 --> 01:36:51.640\nand if you're 25, you may have been a child when the dangling Chad election happened\n\n01:36:51.640 --> 01:36:53.640\nand you felt like, well, this is just sort of how it goes.\n\n01:36:53.640 --> 01:36:55.640\nThere's a lot of contention sometimes.\n\n01:36:55.640 --> 01:36:56.640\nThis is nothing like that.\n\n01:36:56.640 --> 01:37:01.640\nLike we're living in a fucking history book right now and it's shit is going down\n\n01:37:01.640 --> 01:37:05.640\nand we don't have to be doomsayers, but we don't have to choose between that\n\n01:37:05.640 --> 01:37:11.640\nand being naive, but I think that it is valuable for us to get out there\n\n01:37:11.640 --> 01:37:18.640\nand it's easier than you think to just go like, well, maybe it's easier than you think.\n\n01:37:18.640 --> 01:37:19.640\nLet's ask Harry.\n\n01:37:19.640 --> 01:37:24.640\nLike you can show up to this shit and no one is going to demand that you handcuff yourself\n\n01:37:24.640 --> 01:37:26.640\nto a redwood tree and get cut down with it.\n\n01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:29.640\nLike you can show up, dip your toe in.\n\n01:37:29.640 --> 01:37:31.640\nYou can bring Krispy Kreme donuts.\n\n01:37:31.640 --> 01:37:37.640\nLike if you believe in privilege, then privilege is a weapon at these places.\n\n01:37:37.640 --> 01:37:46.640\nLike your lily white face, your lack of antagonism, as unfair as it is to a cop\n\n01:37:46.640 --> 01:37:52.640\nthat's looking through a riot helmet, it actually can be a tool that you're not using\n\n01:37:52.640 --> 01:37:54.640\nif you don't go to these things.\n\n01:37:54.640 --> 01:37:58.640\nSo Cody and I are trying to figure it out.\n\n01:37:58.640 --> 01:38:00.640\nLike we've got to go to this shit.\n\n01:38:00.640 --> 01:38:05.640\nBlack Lives Matter protests must be in dreadful need of big fat white people.\n\n01:38:05.640 --> 01:38:08.640\nLike just to go under the middle.\n\n01:38:08.640 --> 01:38:09.640\nThey're hand raised here.\n\n01:38:09.640 --> 01:38:10.640\nLet's all do it.\n\n01:38:10.640 --> 01:38:12.640\nLet's all do it right now.\n\n01:38:12.640 --> 01:38:14.640\nThere's got to be a protest going on.\n\n01:38:14.640 --> 01:38:15.640\nWell, that's an idea.\n\n01:38:15.640 --> 01:38:16.640\nI want to tell you what to do.\n\n01:38:16.640 --> 01:38:23.640\nThe thing is we have a president who doesn't read and doesn't probably know how to read well.\n\n01:38:23.640 --> 01:38:30.640\nAnd whether he's dyslexic or he just has whatever, like he's just like a willfully ignorant person,\n\n01:38:30.640 --> 01:38:34.640\nhe cannot and does not look at words, but he does look at images.\n\n01:38:34.640 --> 01:38:38.640\nAnd I think the only thing that can really fuck him up is the visual stunning images\n\n01:38:38.640 --> 01:38:42.640\nof a zillion people protesting his every fucking move.\n\n01:38:42.640 --> 01:38:45.640\nAnd I think the thing that fucked him off more than anything in the world\n\n01:38:45.640 --> 01:38:51.640\nwas the day after his shitily attended inauguration was that women and a couple honorable,\n\n01:38:51.640 --> 01:38:55.640\nlike honorary dudes got to go out there and filled the streets.\n\n01:38:55.640 --> 01:38:57.640\nThe biggest protest in the country's history.\n\n01:38:57.640 --> 01:39:01.640\nAnd he does see pictures because he's a child.\n\n01:39:01.640 --> 01:39:04.640\nHe wouldn't.\n\n01:39:04.640 --> 01:39:07.640\nSo we have to go to every fucking thing.\n\n01:39:07.640 --> 01:39:10.640\nAnd Armenians are, you're on the spectrum.\n\n01:39:10.640 --> 01:39:11.640\nYou're logical.\n\n01:39:11.640 --> 01:39:17.640\nYou're like thinking, like we need your, we need you to just,\n\n01:39:17.640 --> 01:39:19.640\nno one wants you to be different.\n\n01:39:19.640 --> 01:39:23.640\nNo one wants you to be less logical, less analytical, less alienated, less isolated.\n\n01:39:23.640 --> 01:39:30.640\nI'm just suggesting for a second that that logical, analytical brain,\n\n01:39:30.640 --> 01:39:33.640\nwhat's that?\n\n01:39:33.640 --> 01:39:38.640\nHear him out.\n\n01:39:38.640 --> 01:39:40.640\nHear him out.\n\n01:39:40.640 --> 01:39:42.640\nWhy?\n\n01:39:42.640 --> 01:39:45.640\nEveryone, but that guy is invited.\n\n01:39:45.640 --> 01:39:47.640\nI'll answer your question a second, sir.\n\n01:39:47.640 --> 01:39:48.640\nI think I know what your question is.\n\n01:39:48.640 --> 01:39:50.640\nI will.\n\n01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:54.640\nWhy do we need white people for the Black Lives Matter?\n\n01:39:54.640 --> 01:39:59.640\nBecause Black Lives Matter protests are not suggesting that black lives are the only ones that matter.\n\n01:39:59.640 --> 01:40:02.640\nAbsolutely.\n\n01:40:02.640 --> 01:40:09.640\nWe're sitting here saying we need white people to make this little bit matter.\n\n01:40:09.640 --> 01:40:11.640\nBecause cops love us as the answer.\n\n01:40:11.640 --> 01:40:15.640\nYes, but it's also very important as white people assess the value you bring to the table,\n\n01:40:15.640 --> 01:40:17.640\nsome of which is your privilege.\n\n01:40:17.640 --> 01:40:22.640\nBut also don't forget to listen to people who are way more disenfranchised than you.\n\n01:40:22.640 --> 01:40:25.640\nIf you show up to a Black Lives Matter protest as a white person,\n\n01:40:25.640 --> 01:40:28.640\nfucking listen to the black people when they tell you what to do or to not do.\n\n01:40:28.640 --> 01:40:30.640\nYeah, church.\n\n01:40:30.640 --> 01:40:35.640\nYou were saying at the Ferguson thing that you were among the white people at the Ferguson protest\n\n01:40:35.640 --> 01:40:38.640\nand that you got big respect and lots of love for being there.\n\n01:40:38.640 --> 01:40:43.640\nOh, well, I was among many white people who were there joining them in their effort.\n\n01:40:43.640 --> 01:40:48.640\nAnd the conversation that I had with a couple of girls as we marched\n\n01:40:48.640 --> 01:40:52.640\nand were met by police every time we turned a corner\n\n01:40:52.640 --> 01:40:58.640\nwas the fact that they were happy that I was there and to see so many white people turning up to support them.\n\n01:40:58.640 --> 01:41:02.640\nAnd not just white people, but, you know, Mexicans coming out and being like,\n\n01:41:02.640 --> 01:41:04.640\nyeah, like Black Lives Matter.\n\n01:41:04.640 --> 01:41:09.640\nBecause what they need is to not be preaching to the choir\n\n01:41:09.640 --> 01:41:13.640\nand to not just be yelling amongst themselves was how they communicated it to me.\n\n01:41:13.640 --> 01:41:18.640\nThey're like, we need the community to show that they support this idea\n\n01:41:18.640 --> 01:41:20.640\nwhether they're black themselves or not.\n\n01:41:20.640 --> 01:41:24.640\nBecause he may be voicing like an id part of the brain that's like,\n\n01:41:24.640 --> 01:41:28.640\nor not to diminish that, but it's like, I want to make sure I understand\n\n01:41:28.640 --> 01:41:31.640\nto the extent that you're speaking for some part of our brain.\n\n01:41:31.640 --> 01:41:35.640\nLike, well, what's the point of all this egalitarianism if we're talking about these like,\n\n01:41:35.640 --> 01:41:37.640\nnow we're going to become little fascists and say,\n\n01:41:37.640 --> 01:41:39.640\nwe need more white people here and we need black people here.\n\n01:41:39.640 --> 01:41:41.640\nLike, we're becoming too racially conscious.\n\n01:41:41.640 --> 01:41:46.640\nMaybe that's part of what you're responding to is like, wait, I thought you were liberals.\n\n01:41:46.640 --> 01:41:50.640\nWhy are we now talking about people like they're insects and sorting them by race?\n\n01:41:50.640 --> 01:41:52.640\nIsn't that what we're trying to get away from?\n\n01:41:52.640 --> 01:41:59.640\nI'm not putting words in your brain, but like, maybe that's like what you're responding to.\n\n01:41:59.640 --> 01:42:02.640\nWhite people listen to other white people too.\n\n01:42:02.640 --> 01:42:04.640\nLike historically they don't listen to black voices.\n\n01:42:04.640 --> 01:42:05.640\nExactly.\n\n01:42:05.640 --> 01:42:10.640\nSo like, while you should as a white person be the person in charge,\n\n01:42:10.640 --> 01:42:13.640\nlike be the messenger to your white friends.\n\n01:42:13.640 --> 01:42:14.640\nAmbassador.\n\n01:42:14.640 --> 01:42:15.640\nSure.\n\n01:42:15.640 --> 01:42:19.640\nBut also there's another thing that's like, just even if you don't leave your apartment,\n\n01:42:19.640 --> 01:42:26.640\nlike that analytical brain of yours that fires on the pistons, you know, like, it's really, really easy.\n\n01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:28.640\nIt feels really comfortable.\n\n01:42:28.640 --> 01:42:34.640\nIt's like a foot slipping into a warm hug, like, to fall back on that.\n\n01:42:34.640 --> 01:42:38.640\nIf you're Spock and you're watching what's happening right now,\n\n01:42:38.640 --> 01:42:42.640\nyou're definitely like, if you commit to that Vulcan energy,\n\n01:42:42.640 --> 01:42:48.640\nyou are definitely always going to be like, well, none of this really makes any sense.\n\n01:42:48.640 --> 01:42:51.640\nIt doesn't really make sense to do anything.\n\n01:42:51.640 --> 01:42:55.640\nDoing stuff will never hold up to logic.\n\n01:42:55.640 --> 01:43:01.640\nAnd I think that it's like, all I'm saying is like, I'm not telling you what to do.\n\n01:43:01.640 --> 01:43:07.640\nI'm telling you that your drunk uncle who has spent like a really criminally long time\n\n01:43:07.640 --> 01:43:10.640\nlike not giving a shit about this stuff is like super alarmed.\n\n01:43:10.640 --> 01:43:13.640\nAnd you can chalk that up to like, oh, your drunk uncle's gotten to that age\n\n01:43:13.640 --> 01:43:15.640\nwhere you start caring about that shit.\n\n01:43:15.640 --> 01:43:17.640\n45-year-old people are uncharismatically political.\n\n01:43:17.640 --> 01:43:19.640\nLike, that's what happens.\n\n01:43:19.640 --> 01:43:20.640\nI'm 25.\n\n01:43:20.640 --> 01:43:21.640\nI don't fucking care about Bitcoin.\n\n01:43:21.640 --> 01:43:25.640\nI don't give a shit about this.\n\n01:43:25.640 --> 01:43:27.640\nAnd I don't know that you're wrong.\n\n01:43:27.640 --> 01:43:35.640\nI will only just tell you that your drunk uncle has decided that this is fucking like we're entering a crossroads.\n\n01:43:35.640 --> 01:43:41.640\nLike there's forth rike or there's like, like rebirth or probably something in between.\n\n01:43:41.640 --> 01:43:46.640\nBut like, as people keep saying, like, you know, all those fantasies about time traveling\n\n01:43:46.640 --> 01:43:49.640\nand going back to these points in history and what would you do if you were there?\n\n01:43:49.640 --> 01:43:51.640\nYou were actually in one right now.\n\n01:43:51.640 --> 01:43:53.640\nAnd you have never been in one.\n\n01:43:53.640 --> 01:43:54.640\nI have never been in one.\n\n01:43:54.640 --> 01:43:57.640\nI'm 44 and I've never, ever, I never did this.\n\n01:43:57.640 --> 01:44:01.640\nI voted for Ross Perot when I was 18 and thought like, I was like, yeah, fucking stiff the system.\n\n01:44:01.640 --> 01:44:07.640\nAnd so I thought, because there was a third party allowed at the debates and I was like, this guy's neat.\n\n01:44:07.640 --> 01:44:09.640\nAnd he's like, what do I care about abortion?\n\n01:44:09.640 --> 01:44:15.640\nIf a raccoon don't hunt, who cares if it's pregnant?\n\n01:44:15.640 --> 01:44:21.640\nAnd I was like, so, and it's worth noting that that probably makes me a guy\n\n01:44:21.640 --> 01:44:25.640\nthat might have been susceptible to a kind of like weird hacky Trump kind of thing.\n\n01:44:25.640 --> 01:44:28.640\nLike if I was 23 these days.\n\n01:44:28.640 --> 01:44:32.640\nBut I doubt a lot of those people are in my audience.\n\n01:44:32.640 --> 01:44:39.640\nBut but I at the same time, I think a lot of my listeners are probably like very wisely,\n\n01:44:39.640 --> 01:44:46.640\nguardingly, like, yeah, but I don't want to be one of these like liberals that like screams and shrieks\n\n01:44:46.640 --> 01:44:53.640\nand goes like, you know, like, like, like, I hate, you know, like, it's like, it throws your logic triggers.\n\n01:44:53.640 --> 01:44:58.640\nYou got like, that's not that can't be a good result. Like this is all about escalation.\n\n01:44:58.640 --> 01:44:59.640\nI see that a lot.\n\n01:44:59.640 --> 01:45:07.640\nAll I'm saying is so then what you could do is like, and if we have to coordinate it like through this podcast or something\n\n01:45:07.640 --> 01:45:10.640\nso that you know, for instance, hey, I'll be there too.\n\n01:45:10.640 --> 01:45:15.640\nAnd we'll have donuts and coffee and like, like, like the like, let's let's go to this shit.\n\n01:45:15.640 --> 01:45:21.640\nI was, yeah, I would say let's put out a whatever we can do to put out that bat signal and say like, like, we live in LA.\n\n01:45:21.640 --> 01:45:27.640\nLike, let's make sure that the people that live here know that like, if it matters, we're going there.\n\n01:45:27.640 --> 01:45:34.640\nAnd also, let's find out like for people that are listening around the country and around the world where they're going to go\n\n01:45:34.640 --> 01:45:36.640\nand let's all like make a loud noise.\n\n01:45:36.640 --> 01:45:43.640\nLike Spencer, I want to ask you because you've been very vocal like, like Twitter and stuff like that about like, you're, you know,\n\n01:45:43.640 --> 01:45:47.640\nyou've been very activist like talking myself. Are you a physical activist?\n\n01:45:47.640 --> 01:45:52.640\nYou just like want to go out and do stuff or are you more like, I'm not making a joke.\n\n01:45:52.640 --> 01:45:58.640\nLike, are you are you someone that would actually get out there and like, no, my flight came home a day early.\n\n01:45:58.640 --> 01:46:03.640\nSo did not make it out.\n\n01:46:03.640 --> 01:46:04.640\nI'm not making a joke.\n\n01:46:04.640 --> 01:46:06.640\nLike, are you someone that would take to the streets?\n\n01:46:06.640 --> 01:46:09.640\nLike, would you get out there and like, I'm for it. Sure.\n\n01:46:09.640 --> 01:46:11.640\nYeah, yeah, I say we do.\n\n01:46:11.640 --> 01:46:16.640\nCertainly there's the one in LA for the tax thing on a was it that's not like April though.\n\n01:46:16.640 --> 01:46:18.640\nYeah, no, there was a march today.\n\n01:46:18.640 --> 01:46:23.640\nYeah, there was a march is all like, like, like almost every day.\n\n01:46:23.640 --> 01:46:28.640\nThere might be ways to foment, like change rebellion, get the health out of this process.\n\n01:46:28.640 --> 01:46:33.640\nThat has nothing to do with you going and holding up a sign or a clever t-shirt or whatever.\n\n01:46:33.640 --> 01:46:35.640\nIf you're a hacker, don't go to a protest.\n\n01:46:35.640 --> 01:46:36.640\nFucking get those tax returns.\n\n01:46:36.640 --> 01:46:38.640\nLike, stay home.\n\n01:46:38.640 --> 01:46:45.640\nIf you're a fan fiction writer, start one of these rogue government accounts and do like, like, like lie.\n\n01:46:45.640 --> 01:46:53.640\nAnd spread propaganda, messaging, figure out ways to whittle away at the heart of the American people.\n\n01:46:53.640 --> 01:46:57.640\nLike, go like, like, like, go like, yeah, like, what is the angle?\n\n01:46:57.640 --> 01:47:07.640\nLike, because the frontal assault of the opposition party was like, through these like, kind of like, really brute force misspelled memes and stuff.\n\n01:47:07.640 --> 01:47:10.640\nIt was like, it appeals to some lizard part of our brain.\n\n01:47:10.640 --> 01:47:16.640\nI don't think we should compete in that playground, but when I see these like, rogue government accounts, like, it occurs to me.\n\n01:47:16.640 --> 01:47:28.640\nIt's like, if this is fake, then this is amazing anti-meme technology because it draws in, like, turning the idea that there's rebellion going on into fan fiction, for instance,\n\n01:47:28.640 --> 01:47:39.640\nand actually properly punctuating and using good grammar to create the illusion that you're reading a Twitter feed from inside the White House as the rebellion is happening.\n\n01:47:39.640 --> 01:47:45.640\nIt's like, that's like a really important way to use your nerdiness, your whatever.\n\n01:47:45.640 --> 01:47:48.640\nWhat are we talking about?\n\n01:47:48.640 --> 01:47:50.640\nWhat can we do to help?\n\n01:47:50.640 --> 01:47:51.640\nYou're already doing it.\n\n01:47:51.640 --> 01:47:54.640\nIn the words of Jell-O we offer, don't hate the media, become the media.\n\n01:47:54.640 --> 01:47:56.640\nGo take photos.\n\n01:47:56.640 --> 01:48:01.640\nWell, I'm asking from the perspective of an audience that's also being kind of encouraged here.\n\n01:48:01.640 --> 01:48:07.640\nBut, you know, it occurs to me that not everybody in this audience may actually agree with what we're saying.\n\n01:48:07.640 --> 01:48:09.640\nWe don't know a lot of the listeners right now either.\n\n01:48:09.640 --> 01:48:10.640\nOh, that's for sure.\n\n01:48:10.640 --> 01:48:13.640\nBut then, call me and we can talk about it.\n\n01:48:13.640 --> 01:48:15.640\nI want to know what you feel.\n\n01:48:15.640 --> 01:48:17.640\nIf you disagree, I'd love to hear how you feel.\n\n01:48:17.640 --> 01:48:25.640\nBut I do think that, like, whatever that means, not everybody's going to be able to go out and protest or whatever it is, you know, that we're talking about.\n\n01:48:25.640 --> 01:48:28.640\nYou're raising your fingers.\n\n01:48:28.640 --> 01:48:31.640\nOh, let's let her talk, baby.\n\n01:48:31.640 --> 01:48:38.640\nI'm just going to say the groups that you're raising money for the ACLU is the absolute best way to do it.\n\n01:48:38.640 --> 01:48:42.640\nYou're fighting right now legally to shut this down immediately.\n\n01:48:42.640 --> 01:48:47.640\nAnd if you don't have the ability to go outside, you have the ability to get to support certain things like the ACLU.\n\n01:48:47.640 --> 01:48:55.640\nFor everybody's birthday or upcoming, like if you're going to buy it, like I said, on Twitter, like Valentine's Day or anybody's upcoming birthday,\n\n01:48:55.640 --> 01:49:02.640\ninstead of getting them some meaningless, like little trinket or whatever like that, just donate any small amount of money to ACLU.\n\n01:49:02.640 --> 01:49:04.640\nEspecially your Redneck family.\n\n01:49:04.640 --> 01:49:09.640\nI think they average, like, $3 million, $4 million in donations a year.\n\n01:49:09.640 --> 01:49:12.640\nIt's over $20 million, I think, right now.\n\n01:49:12.640 --> 01:49:14.640\nLike, since like two weeks ago.\n\n01:49:14.640 --> 01:49:17.640\nSo, also start giving money to more other organizations.\n\n01:49:17.640 --> 01:49:18.640\nExactly.\n\n01:49:18.640 --> 01:49:19.640\nBecause ACLU is good for them.\n\n01:49:19.640 --> 01:49:20.640\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:49:20.640 --> 01:49:26.640\nLike, no, you're not doing your matching, that's good, but like also there's like, we got to, you can't just give to one.\n\n01:49:26.640 --> 01:49:27.640\nI might have choked back.\n\n01:49:27.640 --> 01:49:33.640\nWe kind of like got in on it and then we're like, they just reported that they have $200 billion.\n\n01:49:33.640 --> 01:49:37.640\nBut I think, but also I think the ACLU can use every penny.\n\n01:49:37.640 --> 01:49:38.640\nAbsolutely.\n\n01:49:38.640 --> 01:49:39.640\nThat's not to say we shouldn't be.\n\n01:49:39.640 --> 01:49:42.640\nBut donate like time.\n\n01:49:42.640 --> 01:49:43.640\nIf you don't have money, donate time.\n\n01:49:43.640 --> 01:49:46.640\nAnd if you don't have time or money, donate your voice to stuff like that.\n\n01:49:46.640 --> 01:49:56.640\nIf you're a foodie and a chef and you're barely political, you might just be like, I feel bad for hungry people that are protesting at these places.\n\n01:49:56.640 --> 01:50:07.640\nLike, I think the important thing to know as a person that got dropped privilege dlee and lazily into the middle of a protest and found out it's actually very comfortable and easy.\n\n01:50:07.640 --> 01:50:17.640\nAnd now therefore may have the courage to like get up and like put on my fanny pack and like go to one.\n\n01:50:17.640 --> 01:50:19.640\nIt's easier than you think.\n\n01:50:19.640 --> 01:50:20.640\nIt's not a criminal activity.\n\n01:50:20.640 --> 01:50:24.640\nYou don't have to commit to like take me to jail, mace me in the face.\n\n01:50:24.640 --> 01:50:26.640\nI think the numbers count.\n\n01:50:26.640 --> 01:50:29.640\nThe complexions count for bad reasons, sir.\n\n01:50:29.640 --> 01:50:32.640\nIt's because it's an unfair system, whatever.\n\n01:50:32.640 --> 01:50:33.640\nIt's just a strategy.\n\n01:50:33.640 --> 01:50:35.640\nIt's just more strategy.\n\n01:50:35.640 --> 01:50:43.640\nSaying like get the more news articles about a bunch of people like showing up and saying this is bullshit.\n\n01:50:43.640 --> 01:50:48.640\nI think the imagery is going to speak louder because people stopped reading and people don't believe anything that's told to them.\n\n01:50:48.640 --> 01:50:56.640\nI think pictures of who showed up to which inauguration are undeniable and the fact that a zillion women came out like that.\n\n01:50:56.640 --> 01:50:58.640\nLike what beats that shit?\n\n01:50:58.640 --> 01:51:01.640\nLike like nothing beats that and it was all over the world.\n\n01:51:01.640 --> 01:51:02.640\nLike people did it everywhere.\n\n01:51:02.640 --> 01:51:06.640\nHow about the fucking like 12 people in bitter ass cold Alaska?\n\n01:51:06.640 --> 01:51:09.640\nThat's like hats off to all of them.\n\n01:51:09.640 --> 01:51:13.640\nLike that picture made me cry.\n\n01:51:13.640 --> 01:51:15.640\nLike that's heavy fucking hitting.\n\n01:51:15.640 --> 01:51:21.640\nLike a picture says way more than any tweet or anything like that.\n\n01:51:21.640 --> 01:51:29.640\nAnd a bunch of people smiling and the fact that there were no arrests and everybody like I kept stepping on people's toes and they were cool about it.\n\n01:51:29.640 --> 01:51:32.640\nLike during the women's protest it was it was fucking magical.\n\n01:51:32.640 --> 01:51:36.640\nAlso I'm so sorry to everybody that's listening from Alabama.\n\n01:51:36.640 --> 01:51:37.640\nWhy only all this stuff?\n\n01:51:37.640 --> 01:51:42.640\nLike I'm always taking shits and it's like I fall for that like red versus blue thing.\n\n01:51:42.640 --> 01:51:44.640\nAnd it's like you see these photos.\n\n01:51:44.640 --> 01:51:48.640\nIt's like oh it's Alabama and there's like people's thrusting signs in the air.\n\n01:51:48.640 --> 01:51:49.640\nIt's like fuck Nazis.\n\n01:51:49.640 --> 01:51:50.640\nYou know it's like of course.\n\n01:51:50.640 --> 01:51:54.640\nYou know Dan the way to make it up to them is because it's about the end of the show.\n\n01:51:54.640 --> 01:51:59.640\nMaybe you do a nice laid back apology to those people.\n\n01:51:59.640 --> 01:52:03.640\nAnd you know church if you want to do like the Rihanna hook on it.\n\n01:52:03.640 --> 01:52:07.640\nOh my god church is yeah she's also.\n\n01:52:07.640 --> 01:52:12.640\nOh my god I forgot about church's other identity.\n\n01:52:12.640 --> 01:52:14.640\nYo.\n\n01:52:14.640 --> 01:52:16.640\nIt's about to get so gosh.\n\n01:52:16.640 --> 01:52:19.640\nRob Spencer Harry if you want to get in here.\n\n01:52:19.640 --> 01:52:20.640\nYo.\n\n01:52:20.640 --> 01:52:26.640\nIt's about time about time for the rhyme about democracy.\n\n01:52:26.640 --> 01:52:30.640\nStop hip hop hip hop hip hypocrisy.\n\n01:52:30.640 --> 01:52:38.640\nFrom the A to the B to the C to the B to the E of G to the H I J P element of B.\n\n01:52:38.640 --> 01:52:40.640\nAlphabet Latin.\n\n01:52:40.640 --> 01:52:41.640\nXYZ.\n\n01:52:41.640 --> 01:52:43.640\nI'm talking alphabets.\n\n01:52:43.640 --> 01:52:47.640\nBut that's off topic.\n\n01:52:47.640 --> 01:52:48.640\nLanguage.\n\n01:52:48.640 --> 01:52:51.640\nWhat do you use when you fuck your mama's pussy?\n\n01:52:51.640 --> 01:52:54.640\nDo you blow her fuse?\n\n01:52:54.640 --> 01:52:56.640\nGo down to the breaker.\n\n01:52:56.640 --> 01:52:59.640\nI brought your mama a taker.\n\n01:52:59.640 --> 01:53:03.640\nI take her into the bedroom.\n\n01:53:03.640 --> 01:53:07.640\nTo the break of dawn.\n\n01:53:07.640 --> 01:53:12.640\nI fucked your mama to the break of dawn.\n\n01:53:12.640 --> 01:53:17.640\nWhy is it that we fuck to the break of dawn?\n\n01:53:17.640 --> 01:53:28.640\nIs that a hard out?\n\n01:53:28.640 --> 01:53:35.640\nOr is it more, are we saying like I'm going to fuck you for a long time?\n\n01:53:35.640 --> 01:53:40.640\nThe more you think about it you start to think like wait are we vampires?\n\n01:53:40.640 --> 01:53:46.640\nDoes your dick stop working as the sun breaks the horizon?\n\n01:53:46.640 --> 01:53:50.640\nOh baby sorry thank you for letting me fuck you.\n\n01:53:50.640 --> 01:53:53.640\nDawn has broken.\n\n01:53:53.640 --> 01:54:00.640\nIf you don't mind I'm just going to force myself to fucking comment.\n\n01:54:00.640 --> 01:54:06.640\nMy therapist is asking me a question when they're neurologically I'm actually jerking off to the break of dawn at this point.\n\n01:54:06.640 --> 01:54:09.640\nI'm not even sure if I'm attracted to women.\n\n01:54:09.640 --> 01:54:15.640\nI'm becoming more of a strange dawn fetishist.\n\n01:54:15.640 --> 01:54:22.640\nI'm gonna lay your body down.\n\n01:54:22.640 --> 01:54:27.640\nLike a clown.\n\n01:54:27.640 --> 01:54:31.640\nMy name is MC America.\n\n01:54:31.640 --> 01:54:35.640\nDon't be hysterical about what's going on.\n\n01:54:35.640 --> 01:54:39.640\nJust got some Nazis on the front lawn.\n\n01:54:39.640 --> 01:54:43.640\nGrab your Glock 1719.\n\n01:54:43.640 --> 01:54:45.640\nProtect your block.\n\n01:54:45.640 --> 01:54:46.640\nKnow what I mean?\n\n01:54:46.640 -->

01:55:07.640\nWe may be coming up in Anne Frank times.\n\n01:55:07.640 --> 01:55:16.640\nNot sure if you've grown the protection of innocent people.\n\n01:55:16.640 --> 01:55:18.640\nOr just against your conditions.\n\n01:55:18.640 --> 01:55:21.640\nYou hear certain words and you react.\n\n01:55:21.640 --> 01:55:22.640\nAnd that's fine.\n\n01:55:22.640 --> 01:55:27.640\nBut it's also why the fascist got elected.\n\n01:55:27.640 --> 01:55:31.640\nYou are to blame.\n\n01:55:31.640 --> 01:55:37.640\nThere's blood on your hands no matter whatever you pose.\n\n01:55:37.640 --> 01:55:42.640\nMy
