03:54.940 --> 04:00.300
settlements there's no more line there on that pit boy map have you guys used

04:00.300 --> 04:06.300
the pit boy app on the on the iPad when you're playing Fallout 4 it's exciting

04:06.300 --> 04:10.540
for like 10 seconds and then you realize you're like well this is okay this is

04:10.540 --> 04:15.180
more this is like a the weirder version of hitting the B key like like you're not

04:15.180 --> 04:19.920
it doesn't it's exciting for a second cuz you're like oh you can do all the

04:19.920 --> 04:25.180
shit on your iPad it's I applaud that I love that I like that it's better than

04:25.180 --> 04:29.420
that Rockstar games like you can train your dog if you tap on it and then when

04:29.420 --> 04:33.740
you get back in the game you get like a dog turd or something I like there's

04:33.740 --> 04:37.500
been a lot of attempts to like fuse your handheld devices with your what the

04:37.500 --> 04:41.740
hell are you talking about no I well that's a legitimate question but not in

04:41.740 --> 04:45.780
that tone of voice you don't have a right to be that angry that you don't

04:45.780 --> 04:50.940
know what I'm talking about walk me into your world I don't know do you expect

04:50.940 --> 04:54.780

I love it I miss him already I told him to come the night and be nice like no

05:16.180 --> 05:20.700
man yeah cuz he doesn't want to hear these passive aggressive like like hoots

05:20.700 --> 05:23.700
and hollers they give you when you come back you know you're you're you're

05:23.700 --> 05:30.540
cheering the bad dad how do you think that makes mom feel like she was here

05:30.540 --> 05:35.740
for you all three weeks like make a soup I would I was on the road waking up

05:35.740 --> 05:39.780
early in the morning and watching you bench press but that's what I fucking

05:39.780 --> 05:43.940
did now you're a skinny Dan Harmon and where did Dan Harmon I've been eating a

05:43.940 --> 05:47.900
lot of tacos I had a I have I don't have it anymore because I've eaten like

05:47.900 --> 05:52.700
two pizzas and I had tacos tonight but I had it for a second I did take a

05:52.700 --> 05:57.700
picture of it but I didn't Instagram it I have like the shadow of a half of an

05:57.700 --> 06:06.780
ab I think yeah you won't you won't see it anymore but it was like everyone I'm

06:06.780 --> 06:16.860
getting there can we see it when I saw you won't see it anymore but when I like

06:16.860 --> 06:21.340
somewhere on there it's like when I if you make the images combined from each

06:21.340 --> 06:34.660
eye there oh no hurry up hurry what are you doing is it are you writing a check

06:34.660 --> 06:43.780
he's cross hatching all right you gave me an abs he gave me an abs I don't want

06:43.780 --> 06:47.420
to steal your glory or anything but I was laying in bed this morning and I

06:47.420 --> 06:53.300
looked down and one thing of my like just one sixth of my stomach look like

06:53.300 --> 06:58.540
looked a slight bit defined under the morning light and I was like what is

06:58.540 --> 07:03.860
happening is this an ab yeah yeah I think it's like they said as abs they

07:03.860 --> 07:08.540
come in they don't come in one ab no it's like hair on your beard you can you

07:08.540 --> 07:14.500
can have a quarter ab yeah I think you can have a one pack and also it makes

07:14.500 --> 07:18.260
sense that when you're on the verge of getting a quarter ab that it's gonna be

07:18.260 --> 07:22.180
like poking its head out like a turtle like like it'll be there and then gone

07:22.180 --> 07:26.340
I'm sure you didn't see one when I lifted my shirt up because I don't see it

07:26.340 --> 07:32.140
every every time right I'm slowly like it's gonna keep the frequency with which

07:32.140 --> 07:38.580
you can see it will increase and by 2023 I'm gonna I I've revised my goals I'm

07:38.580 --> 07:42.420
not gonna look like Chris Pratt by January that's not happening I'm

07:42.420 --> 07:46.020
convinced that there's CG and steroids involved in that process and then I won't

07:46.020 --> 07:51.300
I won't touch I'm not high-roading him I just think that it's it's a lie and but

07:51.300 --> 08:01.500
my new goal is original Captain Kirk back in the day nice when you just that

08:01.500 --> 08:10.540
kind of or like Bill Gerard Buck Rogers yeah like when you when a man

08:10.540 --> 08:14.540
would take his shirt off if he was the lead in a show but he could just he could

08:14.540 --> 08:19.740
just have the torso it looked like a can of soup it just looked like a cylinder

08:19.740 --> 08:26.380
and that was considered being fit yeah the absence of anything flowing over

08:26.380 --> 08:30.140
the belt was okay and also they would just wear these big belts like what

08:30.140 --> 08:33.420
they're they'd take their shirt off because like the insect queen would I

08:33.420 --> 08:37.940
demand a gladiator for my satisfaction and then the gladiator outfit would

08:37.940 --> 08:46.140
conveniently involve a belt the size of a shirt who is that handsome specimen he

08:46.140 --> 08:57.020
is an earth man impressive yes you guys don't know how to get down get down I'm

08:57.020 --> 09:01.020
afraid I don't know what you mean this is the 25th century

09:01.020 --> 09:11.820
get down Buck Rogers we've discussed this before if you watch the pilot for

09:11.820 --> 09:17.100
Buck Rogers what watch it and indulge me in a theory I've never looked this up

09:17.100 --> 09:22.380
I'd rather just entertain the theory if you watch it there was a show in the

09:22.380 --> 09:27.420
80s called Buck Rogers it was there was this guy tweaky it had a penis head it

09:27.420 --> 09:34.140
was a little little robot that had a penis helmet head thing and if you watch

09:34.140 --> 09:42.060
the pilot it seems clear to me that the character of tweaky was not voiced by

09:42.060 --> 09:46.060
Mel blank as he became like that's what tweaky became as Buck Rogers would go

09:46.060 --> 09:51.540
come on give me five tweaky and tweaky would go that's right but like get down

09:51.540 --> 09:55.460
and then but I think if you watch the pilot it's clear that this like thing

09:55.460 --> 09:59.300
it's just supposed to walk around but then they because it's not doing anything

09:59.300 --> 10:03.020
but then they like they watched it in post and I think the producers were like

10:03.020 --> 10:07.060
this fucking sucks like what is this little dick robot walking around and

10:07.060 --> 10:12.180
then they brought in the voice of the bugs bunny and he's just walking around

10:12.180 --> 10:16.380
doing nothing but he's saying random shit that's like squeezed in between other

10:16.380 --> 10:20.980
dialogues and they don't establish it doesn't say like oh I spent I spent the

10:20.980 --> 10:25.420
night crossing his circuits or I spilt some micolobe on his circuit board oh

10:25.420 --> 10:30.740
you've infected our robot with 20th century jargon there's no addressing it

10:30.740 --> 10:34.900
at all it's just that the robot is just like going like me that's getting jiggy

10:34.900 --> 10:37.860
with it but it's like walking through and they're like what the fuck is he do I

10:37.860 --> 10:44.620
say that wait for real that he would say look modern stuff you think that was

10:44.620 --> 10:49.100
like I think it was an afterthought I think I think that was a pilot and then

10:49.100 --> 10:52.140
before they got the pilot pickup or after they got the pilot pick up before

10:52.140 --> 10:56.940
they shot the rest of the shit they retooled the character in post by adding

10:56.940 --> 11:01.340
like what if he was saying all the crazy 20th century shit what I that's my

11:01.340 --> 11:05.380
theory just watch it see if you agree or look it up which I refuse to do because

11:05.380 --> 11:09.340
who cares what you learn the truth who cares his name was is it was tweaky yeah

11:09.340 --> 11:15.180
come on man yeah his name was tweaky I mean that that's 21st century he's

11:15.180 --> 11:19.340
fucking he's just a meth fucking guy yeah he's actually named like one of our

11:19.340 --> 11:24.900
fans yeah I mean he looks like our president's dick

11:24.900 --> 11:30.180
our print because he's because it's silver what he looks like a little

11:30.180 --> 11:34.460
mushroom he looks like toad yeah but what we looked like the president's dick

11:34.460 --> 11:38.620
it just looks like a dick why is the president's dick no because stormy

11:38.620 --> 11:43.820
Daniel said our president Donald Trump this dick looks like toad from Mario

11:43.820 --> 11:47.540

I myself esteem requires me to just output and not input but then I'll like

13:51.460 --> 13:54.980
go back to the crab trap and I'll open it up okay like because it's more of a

13:54.980 --> 13:58.700
curiosity I'm like how can you turn how can you turn this bad like are the

13:58.700 --> 14:04.620

14:17.980 --> 14:22.220
one it was like that dog's too hot for your girlfriend as I like like how are

14:22.220 --> 14:26.180
they gonna get misogynist racist political like like what are they gonna

14:26.180 --> 14:29.980
do and that what I the only one that I didn't predict of course why didn't I

14:29.980 --> 14:34.060
predict this was just like immediately or like that's the shit that's dog food

14:34.060 --> 14:37.740
is poison you need to feed your dog better food than that and then people

14:37.740 --> 14:40.380
responding like what did you fucking leave him alone what the fuck what are

14:40.380 --> 14:43.940
you an expert what dog food is but yeah I am I'm an expert you need to know that

14:43.940 --> 14:49.940
shit's packed with the carbohydrates and you need to give him carrots and I've

14:49.940 --> 14:53.980
never seen there's like 20 there's like there's a person in there that's like

14:53.980 --> 14:58.820
like just started there like this is my platform this is my issue like I am

14:58.820 --> 15:02.260
gonna talk about what Dan Harmon's dog is eating and then there's all enough

15:02.260 --> 15:05.540
people like like like trying to knock their hat off that they're like having

15:05.540 --> 15:10.300
like more excuses to type even more their comments get longer and longer it's

15:10.300 --> 15:15.820
like your scum is like unbelievable I just wanted to make this observation and

15:15.820 --> 15:20.900
I know I know the reason I want to make the observation is because I know that

15:20.900 --> 15:24.740
I'm going to suffer for making it and that that I don't know I guess I'm

15:24.740 --> 15:31.580
self-destructive like doesn't everybody see that's like come on

15:31.580 --> 15:36.860
judge it judge it judge it do you think it's really a coincidence that the

15:36.860 --> 15:40.140
people that are the most passionate about animals are they have the worst

15:40.140 --> 15:45.540
social skills in the world like like do we really I mean can we not talk about

15:45.540 --> 15:48.940
that I just you don't have to hate animals to observe the fact that the

15:48.940 --> 15:52.660
people that love them so much that they get angry and spit in your face are like

15:52.660 --> 15:55.980
I don't know what chicken laid what egg but I bet they could tell you what a

15:55.980 --> 16:01.620
chicken shouldn't do and and do you don't you think that it's possible that

16:01.620 --> 16:07.060
that cycle started before they do you think that they were like super chill

16:07.060 --> 16:11.700
and tactful people that were like definitely had like supreme interfacing

16:11.700 --> 16:15.620
and networking skills with their colleagues and their species and then

16:15.620 --> 16:21.340
they gave all of that up when they realized how important animals were or

16:21.340 --> 16:26.060
do you think it might be the other way around we're allowed to say that about

16:26.060 --> 16:31.900
video games ships and bottles stamp collecting like we we we all it'll go

16:31.900 --> 16:37.860
like but if you say that about an animal lover your house could get blown up

16:37.860 --> 16:43.500
like it's like the implicate like and it's like by the way man come on like my

16:43.500 --> 16:54.900
hat goes like did the requirement of being a hero has to be more than saying

16:54.900 --> 17:02.380
I think dogs are good we have to raise the bar on that you have to beat a steam

17:02.380 --> 17:05.780
engine while you're saying it with two hammers or something you have to like

17:05.780 --> 17:11.660
risk something you can't just be like I love that dog yeah we all do he's bread

17:11.660 --> 17:18.260
to be adorable like he's five thousand year process of throwing the ones that

17:18.260 --> 17:25.100
weren't adorable on a campfire like he's a literally eugenics project of like like

17:25.100 --> 17:30.820
it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a genetically malleable fucking like

17:30.820 --> 17:36.500
beast that we found in the wild that reflects our human narcissism it is it

17:36.500 --> 17:43.220
is an experiment in how up our own asses we are it if yes we love it yeah I

17:43.220 --> 17:50.900
like here's some other things I love my keychain Pokemon curtains light a glass

17:50.900 --> 17:56.260
of water after a hard walk around the block you're allowed to love those

17:56.260 --> 18:00.460
things like but why are you yelling at people about it for okay let's bring out

18:00.460 --> 18:10.340

I also he's an old friend because I've known him for so long with like

18:47.380 --> 18:50.060
everybody else that comes on the show it's like we're all workaholics we never

18:50.060 --> 18:53.580
actually see each other we don't have any actual friendships outside of when

18:53.580 --> 18:57.700
we're talking in microphones but just welcome the amazing Brett Gellman and

18:57.700 --> 19:00.500
let's get to know

19:12.980 --> 19:18.780
hey so I told you I said backstage this is no format and I'm a right I'm a

19:18.780 --> 19:23.940
horrible host and you said well that I'm well I'm an equally as horrible guest

19:23.940 --> 19:28.260
yeah so no but I'm a fan of the show so I know I know that you really listen to

19:28.260 --> 19:36.660
this yeah I mean you know just to get my mind off myself or give myself the

19:36.660 --> 19:40.380
illusion that I'm getting my mind off myself when I love it when we when we

19:40.380 --> 19:47.060
moved to this venue the dynasty typewriter owned by the Genji Cohen we

19:47.060 --> 19:50.060
were picking a you had been here already you were yeah you were in the

19:50.060 --> 19:53.220
cupboards when we were touring the house right what's this is Brett Gilman's

19:53.220 --> 19:58.900
in here uh-huh yeah I did a bunch of shows here when it when it first was

19:58.900 --> 20:04.460
opening I love it here and but then it was just whoa way too demanding way too

20:04.460 --> 20:10.100
demanding what did I miss by not seeing your show um there would always be a

20:10.100 --> 20:16.700
theme and it would it would somewhat relate to that theme and I just basically

20:16.700 --> 20:27.980
be an asshole for two hours and no like I showed well my mother when I was when

20:27.980 --> 20:34.940
I was a bar mitzvah age she sent these letters out to all of these comedians

20:34.940 --> 20:39.580
that she got like this big address book from this dude in Vegas like when you

20:39.580 --> 20:44.420
were a kid like she was a kid yeah and I mean I always wanted to do you want to

20:44.420 --> 20:50.700
drink by the way no I'm okay thank you thank you so much I mean I want one but

20:50.700 --> 20:55.620
no I'm just kidding do you want me to have five of them yes I do I do I want

20:55.620 --> 20:59.340
you to have five of them for me for me no I can't I'm alert I'm physically

20:59.340 --> 21:03.980
allergic to it oh no I can't do it so you get all red in the Jewish I know the

21:03.980 --> 21:10.980
Jewish organs start to shut down in breeding people in breeding not a lot

21:10.980 --> 21:16.300
of people in the shtetl in the old country you had to compromise you lucked

21:16.300 --> 21:19.540
out you know you know you don't you don't want you don't want a hollow leg

21:19.540 --> 21:23.420
genetically I don't think that's like a gift right no it'll help you win a

21:23.420 --> 21:28.700
couple contests from the ages of 30 to 40 but the rest is all credit card debt

21:28.700 --> 21:33.460
and if there's anything I do it's win contests just mean like the old thing

21:33.460 --> 21:37.180
you know like we were like oh he drank I drank him under the table and stuff like

21:37.180 --> 21:40.820
that all right you get a couple of thrills you're like Jesus Christ I can't

21:40.820 --> 21:44.260
believe how I fucking drank that dude under the table right right like you

21:44.260 --> 21:48.500
get like three of those and then the rest is just you have like I think it

21:48.500 --> 21:54.620
seems the the ethnicities that are that can hold their liquor the best seem to

21:54.620 --> 21:59.260
also have these eraser moles that grow off of their body uh-huh yeah it's like

21:59.260 --> 22:02.620
an Eastern European thing right anyway sorry what were you talking about no I

22:02.620 --> 22:07.500
got your mom your mom I got some skin tags too though I do have some skin

22:07.500 --> 22:12.540
tags so I'm fucked on that that count as well no but she sent letters to all

22:12.540 --> 22:17.300
of these comedians with and she got their head shots too from this guy right

22:17.300 --> 22:21.700
and sent them a letter you're my son's favorite comedian will you sign this

22:21.700 --> 22:26.260
picture and put in the self-adressed envelope because your mom was like like

22:26.260 --> 22:30.820
Jewish connections and stuff it was all about yeah she was like and will you

22:30.820 --> 22:36.140
hire him someday right yeah well you make his pay equal to yours was your

22:36.140 --> 22:41.740
mom in the business not at all not at all what did she do well I guess in a

22:41.740 --> 22:46.340
way she's in the business she's an agent for photographers for advertising but I

22:46.340 --> 22:50.420
don't think was she doing that no she was I think by the time I was bar mitzvah

22:50.420 --> 22:55.180
showbiz adjacent she was definitely showbiz adjacent the smell of the lime

22:55.180 --> 22:59.180
in the limelight right and she contributes to the agency that tells

22:59.180 --> 23:03.140
showbiz what to do right the advertising agency she certainly knows as a

23:03.140 --> 23:07.060
photographer she's like look I could point this thing at a daddy long legs or

23:07.060 --> 23:13.060
a mountain right and I'll either be Ansel Adams or Oprah exactly I don't I don't

23:13.060 --> 23:19.060
either way I win I don't know who's very long legs bonus oh no Oprah actually

23:19.060 --> 23:28.060
she was a series of famous Daddy long legs in her book take a walk daddy my

23:28.060 --> 23:33.060
journey from passion to professionalism she talks about the heartache of having

23:33.060 --> 23:36.260
to turn your back on what you're truly good at really fulfills you for what

23:36.260 --> 23:39.180
makes money and she was like I was never born to be a talk show host I love

23:39.180 --> 23:43.700
taking photos of Daddy long legs yeah no in her rider whenever she's a guest

23:43.700 --> 23:48.780
anywhere it's in a rider that there are 20 Daddy long legs in her dressing room

23:48.780 --> 23:53.140
along with three different kinds of cameras and that's how she warms up

23:53.140 --> 23:56.860
apparently she's one of those snobs that'll quickly remind you that those

23:56.860 --> 24:03.140
aren't spiders yeah and sure and if you if you even go near that fucking myth

24:03.140 --> 24:06.700
about how they're actually the most toxic insect in the world is that not

24:06.700 --> 24:10.900
true yeah it's totally not true oh really yeah it's one of those things like the

24:10.900 --> 24:14.620
hundredth monkey thing or the it's just like you know it's not true so you don't

24:14.620 --> 24:18.460
look it up and then you look it up and of course it's not true what happens to

24:18.460 --> 24:23.940
every hundredth monthly well I just want to share in case they haven't heard like

24:23.940 --> 24:27.700
it's a fun myth the idea that Daddy long legs you guys know what Daddy long

24:27.700 --> 24:32.700
legs are right everybody knows that they are the the the myth was is that they

24:32.700 --> 24:37.500
they have they have their poisonous but and they actually their poison is

24:37.500 --> 24:42.560
actually could kill you it's actually the most toxic poison per drop right

24:42.560 --> 24:47.660
but there's stingers but they can't penetrate human skin so if they ever were

24:47.660 --> 24:53.020
to try to kill you they would just never be like giving the the son of Sam a

24:53.020 --> 24:57.420
wiffleball bat like a monkey though what's the monkey one what's that what's

24:57.420 --> 25:00.340
the hundredth monkey okay the hundredth monkey thing Jeff you know that yeah

25:00.340 --> 25:06.700
you introduce me that one that's the theory that that there was monkeys on an

25:06.700 --> 25:12.180
island and they'd learned how to take a potato and they found out there was a

25:12.180 --> 25:19.180
star you to do you want me to grab it grab you like grab this baby I want

25:19.180 --> 25:22.320
you to ration and grab it seems like your pinchers aren't penetrating my

25:22.320 --> 25:27.780
epidermis like I know the information you got could fuck about my mind I'm not

25:27.780 --> 25:31.260
feeling the pinchers that was the Daddy long legs of information the idea that

25:31.260 --> 25:35.900
any any community of animals that start learning one new trait that across the

25:35.900 --> 25:40.100
world right there's no way they could have communicated it was a it was a it

25:40.100 --> 25:45.660
was a it was a it was a the legend was that there was a anthropological or

25:45.660 --> 25:53.900
whatever you call it when it's monkeys a moncological primatological like watch

25:53.900 --> 25:57.180
tower like it was like in an archipelago or something they're like

25:57.180 --> 26:00.940
monitoring this monkey population and the monkey population would eat potatoes

26:00.940 --> 26:07.900
and then and then they they observed a monkey like dropping its potato in some

26:07.900 --> 26:13.260
saltwater and then get fishing it out and eating it and then observed it like

26:13.260 --> 26:18.660
being blown away by both the cleaner potato and a salted potato and then

26:18.660 --> 26:23.340
observed it teaching a friend monkey all of this scans with what we know about

26:23.340 --> 26:26.340
monkeys they're actually quite smart they could write Hamlet if you gave them

26:26.340 --> 26:32.700
enough time and space and typewriters the the but then the the the hundredth

26:32.700 --> 26:37.780
monkey principle is sort of a pop science like x-factor principle that

26:37.780 --> 26:42.300
says that these people were watching this group of monkeys on one island and

26:42.300 --> 26:48.020
that when the hundredth monkey learned to wash their potato that spontaneously

26:48.020 --> 26:53.820
an unrelated research or unconnected like research tower watching the same

26:53.820 --> 26:58.980
species but a completely unconnected island of monkeys that they spontaneously

26:58.980 --> 27:05.780
began washing their potatoes without any causal thing so the hundredth monkey

27:05.780 --> 27:13.540
concept is the idea of genetic Wi-Fi of like every learned but it's a myth but

27:13.540 --> 27:19.340
it's a myth that never happened every hundredth monkey is psychic

27:20.340 --> 27:28.900
I think it's the idea that that like evolutionary like wise like when enough

27:28.900 --> 27:36.100
of a community learn something it becomes global because like it was like an

27:36.100 --> 27:39.140
evolutionary thing it was going to happen anyway yeah I think the idea would

27:39.140 --> 27:42.100
be with some of this stuff which I think it's important to stay open to because

27:42.100 --> 27:48.700
God knows before Einstein they they believed in this shit called the ether

27:48.700 --> 27:52.500
they had to it's what filled in all of the blank spaces when there's that many

27:52.500 --> 27:57.660
blank spaces why does light behave this way so scientists in the modern world a

27:57.660 --> 28:04.100
world that had gasoline watches not quite television but boy if you saw one

28:04.100 --> 28:07.860
of these people in a time travel town like you wouldn't they wouldn't be an

28:07.860 --> 28:12.740
alien this is like fucking 20s and people believed in this like interstellar

28:12.740 --> 28:17.220
jelly that we couldn't see or detect called the ether that was the thing

28:17.220 --> 28:22.700
that explained why if you turn on your flashlight in a box car that's traveling

28:22.700 --> 28:27.260
that the that a person observing the box car will see the light that I'd move at

28:27.260 --> 28:29.980
different whatever the fuck that whatever the whatever the whatever the

28:29.980 --> 28:33.300
whatever the blank spaces were and all the questions that we needed to answer

28:33.300 --> 28:37.860
about light I don't honestly I can't wrap my brain around even the questions

28:37.860 --> 28:41.140
that they're asking so I don't blame them for inventing this thing called the

28:41.140 --> 28:45.820
ether they're like well that's the ether they would say when you if you if you

28:45.820 --> 28:52.140
if you're driving in a box car that it's it's filled with ether which we can't

28:52.140 --> 28:55.780
we can't measure it doesn't weigh anything it's just like this jelly that

28:55.780 --> 28:59.460
travels with the box car well why are people why are people driving in box

28:59.460 --> 29:03.540
cars so like because it's because they didn't because they were trying to

29:03.540 --> 29:07.860
illustrate that you know you know the old stand-up joke if you're traveling at

29:07.860 --> 29:11.780
the speed of light in your car and you turn the headlights on what happens so

29:11.780 --> 29:15.260
like that's an it starts with a legitimate question that they really had

29:15.260 --> 29:19.820
what happens well theoretically would yeah I don't know do the headlights fall

29:19.820 --> 29:24.580
off do you does the do you get younger just the light turn into a candle that

29:24.580 --> 29:29.580
joke who did that joke we did it first yeah that's nine I think I feel like I

29:29.580 --> 29:43.660
think it was Paul Rodriguez the speed of light in my barrio was anyways the you

29:43.660 --> 29:48.060
know it seems like a Stephen Wright like I thought it was maybe Stephen Wright but

29:48.060 --> 29:53.540
yeah anyways god damn it whatever but I'm saying like people make up fairy tales

29:53.540 --> 29:59.140
the scientific community makes up that's why it's so annoying whenever

29:59.140 --> 30:04.900
anybody proposes science in terms of an argument for something because I mean

30:04.900 --> 30:09.580
no it's not always annoying actually it's quite essential these days we're

30:09.580 --> 30:14.380
actually I mean the opposite of what I just said

30:14.380 --> 30:24.820
yeah no I mean we should never mind I'm not even going to I do have a point

30:24.820 --> 30:28.700
beyond that point but I I'm not gonna even make it because I need to support

30:28.700 --> 30:33.180
science right now fully and utterly no listen to science science is right

30:33.180 --> 30:39.660
hundred percent let's go with science try that on for size world and United

30:39.660 --> 30:44.740
States yeah I think science is having a pretty good year right now you think so

30:44.740 --> 30:49.300
science is having a good run they're definitely they're definitely heroes

30:49.300 --> 30:55.700
right yeah like they're like the way Han Solo was in the end of Empire yeah

30:55.700 --> 30:59.740
yeah yeah oh no totally definitely our favorite character walking out of the

30:59.740 --> 31:06.820
theater yeah very sad point right oh yeah it's got frozen in carbon I mm-hmm yeah

31:06.820 --> 31:16.020
but right before it did it said I know too I love you maybe yeah maybe maybe one

31:16.020 --> 31:21.260
of us need to dress up like Princess Leia did we have to scam science free

31:21.260 --> 31:25.660
right we have to stop taking the high road I do think we actually extend this

31:25.660 --> 31:30.060
metaphor I hope when science thaws out it is as big a pussy as Han Solo was in

31:30.060 --> 31:36.100
Jedi sorry for using pussy as a pejorative but it's a the the the because

31:36.100 --> 31:41.940
science like is all that science needs to if we if we survive this culture war

31:41.940 --> 31:45.940
yeah I would like to see one of the side effects be that science just in

31:45.940 --> 31:51.740
general not scientists not each individual scientist but if like a two-way

31:51.740 --> 31:56.180
agreement between people in science which says you know what this is a

31:56.180 --> 32:01.940
religion in the sense that it is a connection to the unknown and therefore

32:01.940 --> 32:09.300
you can't necessarily be science and simultaneously say I don't care I don't

32:09.300 --> 32:12.860
know what happens I don't care what happens who gives a shit it's not my job

32:12.860 --> 32:18.100
you know what I mean like right like it we are lost little lambs because we did

32:18.100 --> 32:25.460
a long time ago agree to trust in science over all this other Michigas the

32:25.460 --> 32:30.500
right we in spite of what we see every day that frustrates us we have as a

32:30.500 --> 32:37.900
species decided to be humanist and and be like look I'm not gonna believe things

32:37.900 --> 32:40.660
that people that threaten to burn you at the stake tell me to believe I'm gonna

32:40.660 --> 32:46.900
believe the people looking through telescopes right and so we since we're

32:46.900 --> 32:52.660
obviously not gonna spontaneously develop a culture that saves us that

32:52.660 --> 32:55.620
chills us to be good people and since we no longer want to base that on whether

32:55.620 --> 32:59.860
you go to heaven or hell like the next step is we have to become like Vulcan

32:59.860 --> 33:04.420
you know like and and we need a science Jesus science we need a science Jesus

33:04.420 --> 33:08.780
yeah who won't act like Jesus he'll because he'll be like I don't want to

33:08.780 --> 33:14.540
get crucified I'm a scientist all of my data shows that will hurt and will kill

33:14.540 --> 33:21.540
me and I all I ask is for you to think about that for a second empathy is

33:21.540 --> 33:28.340
scientifically right like proven to solve our problems communication honesty

33:28.340 --> 33:32.340
like so maybe connect some of these things that we currently look at as

33:32.340 --> 33:37.380
being like moralistic and disconnect morality from this other thing that we

33:37.380 --> 33:42.700
call religion yeah so that we can finally be like like it's like we still

33:42.700 --> 33:48.180
connect we still connect the concept of atheism to like a morality like it's

33:48.180 --> 33:52.100
still getting done it still gets done in your head we gotta we gotta we gotta we

33:52.100 --> 33:59.060
gotta fix that I feel like I feel like Spencer is our science Jesus oh shit you

33:59.060 --> 34:04.900
guys you're in trouble buddy I got a box car full of ether out back

34:08.140 --> 34:11.180
yeah

34:12.540 --> 34:18.980
I mean wow what a science Jesus wow and the street value of ether is really

34:18.980 --> 34:24.460
through the roof now that it's been disproven I know you can't make more the

34:24.460 --> 34:29.300
bad news is we were wrong about the ether the good news is we got a fucking

34:29.300 --> 34:38.900
ton of it everybody let's get not someone has quailudes right is either

34:38.900 --> 34:43.340
the new quailudes or it was back then quailudes are the new ether right but

34:43.340 --> 34:50.580
also those are gone what about what about poppers you guys do poppers like

34:50.580 --> 34:58.220
jalapeno or amelonitrate jalapeno or amelonitrate I did it once at a bar that

34:58.220 --> 35:03.820
said that the cleaning fluid right I don't know that could be that I'll take

35:03.820 --> 35:09.140
anything tape had tape had cleaning was the 80s like it was like the DIY I

35:09.140 --> 35:13.140
remember it was the door the movie the doors where I first saw a popper and I

35:13.140 --> 35:16.380
was like what is that I still don't know that's why I bring it up at comedy

35:16.380 --> 35:20.900
show you know it's like a thing that you release in your dad had like cleaning

35:20.900 --> 35:25.660
fluid for for videotape that's that's you can and you could buy that no that's

35:25.660 --> 35:28.420
not amelonitrate that I know of I don't know if it's like related the way

35:28.420 --> 35:36.420
Sudafed is related to math or whatever but but like I just always find out I

35:36.420 --> 35:40.900
know the two things that I know the one thing that those two things have in

35:40.900 --> 35:48.740
common why is that they but they're supposedly dilate your butthole like

35:48.740 --> 35:53.780
amelonitrate poppers and like and huffing tape head cleaner there were

35:53.780 --> 35:59.540
these things called tapes and these things called buttholes that we believe

35:59.540 --> 36:09.700
needed to be dilated back in the early 80s your butt had holes it would be good

36:09.700 --> 36:15.220
I mean what a great thing if you're constipated yeah but do you think if you

36:15.220 --> 36:19.260
dilate your butt and you're constipated do you think the turd just falls out like

36:19.260 --> 36:25.100
you're probably right we're not horses yeah yeah I don't know if it's like when

36:25.100 --> 36:29.100
you're probably not what happens to horses either it looks like that that

36:29.100 --> 36:32.900
their assholes just opening and shit drops out but no there's probably a

36:32.900 --> 36:35.740
pushing that's coming there's definitely a pushing that's going on there's a

36:35.740 --> 36:39.860
digestive tract and I'm sure I wouldn't be just falling out with horses and

36:39.860 --> 36:42.660
elephants because they're just they're literally eating fiber that's all they

36:42.660 --> 36:48.980
eat yeah they're like taking in so much fiber yeah but I did okay why what we

36:48.980 --> 36:51.700
don't have to talk about this but I what I did actually come to think of it I

36:51.700 --> 36:56.460
was severely constipated once because I was on the Atkins diet and I told this

36:56.460 --> 37:01.900
story here before where I had I had a softball sized oof how do I put this

37:01.900 --> 37:07.500
turd yeah like like like reaching like like like like crowning and yeah I was

37:07.500 --> 37:11.860
unable to like and there's a whole story of Rob Schrab coming over and like he had

37:11.860 --> 37:17.260
a screw sliding some drug he found in a grocery store because I texted him help

37:17.260 --> 37:23.020
me and he brought some thing that he bought that's supposed to help make you

37:23.020 --> 37:27.180
poop and he read they do is like a fucking 86 com joke where he read the

37:27.180 --> 37:31.260
directions and then we had a Halloween party that night so he read the

37:31.260 --> 37:36.180
direction said like take one tablet and you'll poop in two hours so he so he

37:36.180 --> 37:41.340
just was like we're gonna go to the party in 15 minutes take four of these oh

37:41.940 --> 37:47.140
no and I just believed him and he just slid pills under the door he didn't

37:47.140 --> 37:51.100
slide directions nor would I have read them I was like I'm if you're texting

37:51.100 --> 37:56.700
Rob Schrab for help yeah you're helpless right like you are you realize that you

37:56.700 --> 38:01.420
have no friends and like that you your life is flashing before your eyes yeah

38:01.420 --> 38:08.340
yeah and did you shit your pants at the party yeah I know I know I didn't I

38:08.340 --> 38:13.980
didn't shit my pants I I made it to the bathroom and zipped my ghostbusters a

38:13.980 --> 38:19.540
jumpsuit oh Halloween and I don't know I never followed up with the person whose

38:19.540 --> 38:24.980
house it was to see if I cracked the porcelain because what happened is

38:24.980 --> 38:30.460
nothing happened to the softball this drug that Schrab quadrupled it was just

38:30.460 --> 38:36.740
like dude was just jamming gunpowder in the oh no into the breach it was just

38:36.740 --> 38:43.580
putting it and so I just just fucking fired this fucking fucking black

38:43.580 --> 38:50.060
beard fucking yeah like like like pirate movie a cannonball a cannonball I

38:50.060 --> 38:54.380
don't know why I'm why am I why am I how do I put this it was a joke I already

38:54.380 --> 38:58.580
put it that way it was a fucking ballish hard shit they're like flying out of my

38:58.580 --> 39:07.540
ass explosively like I'm pretty sure I and I just went home like ghosts busted

39:07.540 --> 39:18.220
right everything who you gonna call yeah plumber yeah no I mean after you do

39:18.220 --> 39:22.100
that the rest of the night's gonna be incredibly anticlimactic yeah it's like

39:22.100 --> 39:26.540
going to Vietnam I assume yeah I could have come back out listening to your

39:26.540 --> 39:31.820
stories about improv right you can't get some improv for you yeah I just yes

39:31.820 --> 39:40.340
ended fucking biology yeah that that cannonball by forcefully firing it

39:40.340 --> 39:47.100
from your dilated asshole like altered states like I'm coming out with goat

39:47.100 --> 39:53.820
blood on my chin we may have discussed this on the show before but when you

39:53.820 --> 39:58.740
when you're on the cabbage soup diet ah man well you're gonna follow up one poop

39:58.740 --> 40:02.220
thing with another but yeah of course we've discussed it of course we have it

40:02.220 --> 40:05.900
was bad this is him referencing the way I described a shit I took it's it's you

40:05.900 --> 40:10.940
know I don't I just I just want to register my shame I I where how did

40:10.940 --> 40:15.500
Brett he described the shit he took on the on the cabbage soup diet as he looked

40:15.500 --> 40:21.300
back at the ball it looks like the Kennedy autopsy all right okay all right

40:21.300 --> 40:27.220
these are these are private communications with a friend I look no

40:27.220 --> 40:30.340
one told me we'd be living in this world where all of this is everyone's

40:30.340 --> 40:35.300
business I don't know about I don't know about the audience here and at home but

40:35.300 --> 40:40.060
I completely understand what you're talking about I like to give things

40:40.060 --> 40:47.060
weight when I describe them of course how could you not we can't be on a show

40:47.060 --> 40:50.500
either and just say oh yeah it was diarrhea it's boring yeah and I know a

40:50.500 --> 40:52.940
lot of people are gonna go what those photos were black and white and I'm

40:52.940 --> 40:59.620
saying yes but they were colored with national tragedy exactly and historic

40:59.620 --> 41:06.900
importance yeah and and and and and misconduct like like possible tampering

41:06.900 --> 41:14.860
at the highest levels yeah very very tragic grief yeah very tragic very

41:14.860 --> 41:19.380
tragic event it's the appropriate palette to draw from emotionally yeah the fact

41:19.380 --> 41:26.100
that Zapruder himself film of that shit you took it makes it all right imagine

41:26.100 --> 41:28.860
the people that listen some people listen to like all 400 episodes this

41:28.860 --> 41:32.300
package like this is the fifth time they've talked about that cabbage soup shit

41:32.300 --> 41:35.820
first for a second in the middle of that story when you're like and Rob was at

41:35.820 --> 41:38.780
the grocery store and he's like yeah I'll get you something and what he brought

41:38.780 --> 41:45.700
back in my mind was going to be ahead of lettuce quite differently let us like

41:45.700 --> 41:49.260
lettuce fights cabbage like a mongoose in a coat oh no I mean with the with the

41:49.260 --> 41:58.820
with the cannonball with the meatball okay sorry all right well wow people got

41:58.820 --> 42:03.620
it I feel like people reacted to that like I think they're mad at us I think

42:03.620 --> 42:07.940
they're mad and I I hope it's not because they're disturbed it must be just

42:07.940 --> 42:11.460
like okay enough yeah they're exhausted enough with the they're just exhausted

42:11.460 --> 42:15.740
yeah it's exhausting they express that sometimes through applause like where

42:15.740 --> 42:22.420
they're like that's great and enough and that's yeah that's the average person

42:22.420 --> 42:26.460
who watches anything yeah we do they're good they're good kids they mean well of

42:26.460 --> 42:30.180
course oh no I didn't mean that they had no idea that no of course I'm blaming us

42:30.180 --> 42:34.820
I'm fully blaming us I'm not blaming not blaming you and we're sorry that we handed

42:34.820 --> 42:43.500
you a pre-ruined world finally enjoy living in a volcano with a with a cloned

42:43.500 --> 42:49.020
pterodactyl who's had its genes merged with with a with a with a with a with a

42:49.020 --> 42:57.140
criminal so that we could justify paying at three cents an hour then when then if

42:57.140 --> 43:01.340
you complain about it pecking your kidney out while it's delivering packages

43:01.340 --> 43:06.420
for Amazon you get sued enjoy hey at least at least all of that is

43:06.420 --> 43:12.340
scientific we got cloning in there we got we love science we got money

43:12.340 --> 43:17.980
exchanges which is in a way a science oh yeah it's definitely not from the

43:17.980 --> 43:27.100
people that brought it's real yeah so what what what what what I of course yes the

43:27.100 --> 43:32.660
reason the reason I am a lifetime fan is because I I think I was the number one

43:32.660 --> 43:37.660
eagle eagle heart fan oh really yeah you must have been and that means a lot you

43:37.660 --> 43:42.700
could hear that I said the name of the show and no one applauded yeah nobody

43:42.700 --> 43:46.940
watched that show nobody watched a true crime I think it was a great show it was

43:46.940 --> 43:52.260
such a masterpiece I really really enjoyed it I binge watched it I was so

43:52.260 --> 43:58.260
impressed that was like my first steady job that I was proud of yeah to be a

43:58.260 --> 44:03.860
part of yeah I was it was really something it was yeah it was really fun

44:03.860 --> 44:10.460
to work on plus like working with Chris you know who was I feel like a lot of us

44:10.460 --> 44:15.180
wouldn't be here right now if it wasn't I told I mean I was a kid I got to say to

44:15.180 --> 44:20.580
him because he worked on community as a in a cameo so I finally got to say to him

44:20.580 --> 44:24.340
which just felt like it's it's like so many you have heroes that you know it

44:24.340 --> 44:27.900
doesn't matter you're gonna say to them but you just it feels like it's like the

44:27.900 --> 44:31.180
mecca thing like you just I have to I have to say to this person I have to get

44:31.180 --> 44:36.020
this out I have to go to this wall yeah it's not gonna affect them I need to like

44:36.020 --> 44:42.340
like touch and say when I was 12 years old blah blah blah and you know I got to

44:42.340 --> 44:45.580
say that to Catherine O'Hara I got to say that to Martin Short I got to say that

44:45.580 --> 44:50.620
I needed to say to Chris Elliott thank you so much for doing action family on

44:50.620 --> 44:55.460
Cinemax did you remember oh yeah the best it was an FDR a one-man show yeah

44:55.460 --> 44:59.220
like you see that no I didn't I didn't see that oh that's on you you should watch

44:59.220 --> 45:04.340
that I love that that was on Cinemax that was his other special okay yeah yeah

45:04.340 --> 45:08.780
the action family was like that was the fight never when was I ever gonna see

45:08.780 --> 45:14.700
anyone deconstructively saying like oh like I was still just a kid going like

45:14.700 --> 45:17.780
well I don't know why people are laughing whenever this happens I don't

45:17.780 --> 45:21.500
know why this film stock is being used like right like you need to see that

45:21.500 --> 45:25.420
should deconstruct it as soon as possible like as young as possible your

45:25.420 --> 45:30.700
well your neurology is still yeah he doesn't get enough credit or what he did

45:30.700 --> 45:37.700
I think he's one I think he's one of the most if not the most under-appreciated

45:37.700 --> 45:45.180
American comedian I think yeah I mean completely innovative and crazy yeah

45:45.180 --> 45:50.380
no I told him I loved him and then he was and he was kind of a dick about it

45:50.380 --> 45:54.820
right he's a dick no I'm kidding okay no he would torture me he would torture me

45:54.820 --> 45:58.340
but he made me tough it was I think out of love I don't know well it was

45:58.340 --> 46:03.940
probably self-loving it would just be like nobody likes you like nobody likes

46:03.940 --> 46:08.940
you I'd be like people like me you had to be like a second banana you had to be

46:08.940 --> 46:13.060
a straight man in order to hang out you know and he would just be there no and

46:13.060 --> 46:15.980
I'd be like people like me they everybody likes me here you know yeah they

46:15.980 --> 46:20.740
like you as a person but not as an actor you're terrible you're terrible but it's

46:20.740 --> 46:25.860
okay we're all terrible but you're I'm the best Maria's in the middle and you're

46:25.860 --> 46:32.060
the fucking worst Mr. UCB ooh I've got a hat let me put it on then become

46:32.060 --> 46:38.340
someone else you would do that to me for hours all day all day I guess that's

46:38.340 --> 46:41.980
that's my wheelhouse like I that I've learned yeah I've learned to like pull

46:41.980 --> 46:48.780
back on because it it does just over I guess it's toxic you know it toxifies

46:48.780 --> 46:53.180
people but the place I it comes from though is like it's truly like you're

46:53.180 --> 46:57.980
lampooning yourself you see like that was I was always my formula in my 30s as I

46:57.980 --> 47:02.500
was always like can you imagine if I was bullying you for this how funny that

47:02.500 --> 47:06.700
would be yeah but like then the times kind of devolved into like of course I

47:06.700 --> 47:11.300
can imagine you bullying before it right the president is a Nazi yeah yeah I

47:11.300 --> 47:15.260
should shut up I think I would be taking this all a lot worse if it weren't for

47:15.260 --> 47:19.260
Chris I think I would be taking Trump even worse not that I'm taking a well

47:19.260 --> 47:25.660
but no but yeah no this one time I there was a scene where I don't remember why

47:25.660 --> 47:30.140
but my my character's legs had been sawn off and I was like in this apparatus

47:30.140 --> 47:33.580
in this table and it looked like I was just like legless sitting on this table

47:33.580 --> 47:37.500
and it was so fucking hot we're like rented out this like warehouse and turned

47:37.500 --> 47:41.900
it into a studio in Santa Clarita it was not a say it was it was like dead of

47:41.900 --> 47:47.340
summer so fucking hot the AC like you might as well have not had it on and

47:47.340 --> 47:52.140
I'm there I'm like sweating my ass off and then he's around and he's doing the

47:52.140 --> 48:00.620
scene with me and he's like oh my god you smell like duty oh my god oh pungent

48:00.620 --> 48:05.860

48:05.860 --> 48:09.660
like everybody everybody let me and I'm like I don't smell like duty I don't

48:09.660 --> 48:13.460
smell like duty he's like yes you do you smell like duty and then he was like

48:13.460 --> 48:21.020
everybody got the whole crew to line up and smell the top crack of my ass in

48:21.020 --> 48:26.220
order to agree with him that I smelled like duty that's that's I'm gonna say

48:26.220 --> 48:33.220
that's too much just because I like to keep it verbal yeah no it was physical

48:33.220 --> 48:37.020
I don't like smelling things that triggers me yeah no I got I got sniffed a

48:37.020 --> 48:41.020
lot on the playground I never was like so simultaneously pissed off and then

48:41.020 --> 48:46.420
laughing so hard did you smell like duty maybe I did maybe I did smell like

48:46.420 --> 48:50.060
duty and then I went back in my trailer after I cleaned up and then there was a

48:50.060 --> 48:54.340
pair of tidy whiteies waiting for me that he had colored in the ass with

48:54.340 --> 49:00.140

because he's the popo yeah no no I mean that wouldn't have been funny I would

52:13.300 --> 52:16.180
have been mad at you if that was it I just got excited because I was like

52:16.180 --> 52:23.260
wait they call him popo and that's almost poopoo because special why why did

52:23.260 --> 52:31.140
the police officer smell bad because he had a duty he you know why I like mine

52:31.140 --> 52:35.900
I like mine because he was I like mine because he was on duty because he was on

52:35.900 --> 52:45.140
duty that's the same Joe duty all right he had a duty to protect because he had

52:45.140 --> 52:50.140
a duty to what why did the honorable hard-working police officer because he

52:50.140 --> 52:54.500
was in the line of duty I mean it's all it all works it's fine it's all good if

52:54.500 --> 52:58.460
you're in a game show and he said in the line of duty if he judges and they

52:58.460 --> 53:04.340
would get a ding otherwise people are gonna riot duty's good duty thank you I

53:04.340 --> 53:09.820
appreciate it yeah yeah no that's good I but I think there's this work to be done

53:09.820 --> 53:15.340
on the popo yeah I think there's a joke we can get there yeah why do you know why

53:15.340 --> 53:26.580
the stuntman smelled bad why are you writing a new one yeah yeah because he

53:26.580 --> 53:33.580
had to do a stunt he or she yeah or they right had to do a stunt where they

53:33.580 --> 53:38.460
took a gigantic shit yeah that's probably it that's probably so

53:38.460 --> 53:45.460
scatological this is tell us why the stuntman why I'm gonna go with Brett's I

53:45.460 --> 53:49.860
stop making it wasn't a rhetorical question they had to do a stunt where

53:49.860 --> 53:57.860
they rolled around in a skunk yard yeah the box with that's adorable what smells

53:57.860 --> 54:07.260
worse than a junkyard a skunk yard oh it's pretty good right I don't want

54:07.260 --> 54:11.060
people to think these were all good memories with you was not abusing me it

54:11.060 --> 54:16.620
was fun you know I I I mean maybe it was abuse and I just didn't register it as

54:16.620 --> 54:21.740
that but but you know what you have to be okay with being a little mean at times

54:21.740 --> 54:25.620
still do you know especially on our side do you know what I think we need to be a

54:25.620 --> 54:30.220
little meaner what's purple and very dangerous what a grape with a machine gun

54:30.220 --> 54:37.620
yeah oh see sometimes you got to be edgy right or I'm sorry if I look and

54:37.620 --> 54:48.820
offended you but it's true a machine gun and fucking kill you yeah do you know

54:48.820 --> 54:53.940
what my mom told me this is my favorite this is the first joke I ever told is

54:53.940 --> 54:57.100
my favorite joke and I was a kid you don't remember telling it I don't remember

54:57.100 --> 55:01.380
telling okay my mom could be full of shit but she she includes the

55:01.380 --> 55:05.860
pronunciation of the punchline that I would do and my it was what's what's

55:05.860 --> 55:14.740
gray and has four legs and a trunk a mouse going on vacation oh great I like

55:14.740 --> 55:19.540
that it seems a little very sophisticated joke I know that you told

55:19.540 --> 55:23.180
it I don't know it seems like I didn't I feel like I'm using a spawning spider

55:23.180 --> 55:26.540
teeth I was just spawning gray but then we're in a gray barrel okay I feel like

55:26.540 --> 55:32.100
that joke qualifies as child abuse it's because the child is abusing it's Joe

55:32.100 --> 55:38.340
Bunchausen she's projecting she's projecting her need to tell jokes to you

55:38.340 --> 55:43.460
which in the end served you yeah no it's like I'm good in that story but I

55:43.460 --> 55:48.260
kind of don't believe it anymore than a lot of stuff why wouldn't your mom still

55:48.260 --> 55:54.220
alive yes does she and I first I have to check a couple things before asking you

55:54.220 --> 55:57.540
the question is she suffering from actual dementia or anything like that no

55:57.540 --> 56:02.020
so is she is your is your mom who's not suffering from dementia but it's just

56:02.020 --> 56:07.100
your mom's age is she starting to make shit up and redact and revise like

56:07.100 --> 56:11.420
memories that you were pretty confident were like part of your cannon and then

56:11.420 --> 56:14.820
like you're you're you're an adult and you're visiting and you're like yeah

56:14.820 --> 56:20.860
it's like that time that that soup got spilled or Uncle Dave did this and my

56:20.860 --> 56:25.660
mom will just go like the fuck are you talking about Uncle Dave was a war

56:25.660 --> 56:31.140
hero I never spilled soup in his life you know it's like what the fuck what is

56:31.140 --> 56:36.380
that are you gaslighting me like what are you like who is crazy my mom like I

56:36.380 --> 56:39.940
don't know what she's doing it feels like 36 hours with James Garner maybe

56:39.940 --> 56:43.920
like do I have the plans to D-day and I don't know it like my mom you'll look

56:43.920 --> 56:49.540
it up yeah no my mother doesn't do that my mother likes to consistently pretend

56:49.540 --> 56:57.580
of like seeing a whole situation you know decades in the in the in the making

56:57.580 --> 57:03.140
of of something that was the dynamic that is not that I have to constantly

57:03.140 --> 57:07.100
remind her that's not the way that is and each time I'm disagreed with your mom

57:07.100 --> 57:11.460
will just say the 70s were all about potatoes is that what you is that what

57:11.460 --> 57:18.220
you saying or no just like we were always happy go lucky oh right right you

57:18.220 --> 57:23.340
know that type of thing my mom yeah not true not true yeah like that type of

57:23.340 --> 57:27.260
thing yeah I definitely inherited and this is actually to my mom's credit to

57:27.260 --> 57:31.860
the extent that I like myself but my personality is very much like I know I

57:31.860 --> 57:40.340
have to catch myself like my mom and I love explaining everything like shit

57:40.340 --> 57:44.020
that is none of our fucking business like there's nothing at stake for us we

57:44.020 --> 57:50.100
just have to every you get like a napkin a manufacturer could could introduce

57:50.100 --> 57:57.100
himself to me and say or herself you're welcome yes that's right women can be

57:57.100 --> 58:04.300
napkin manufacturers yeah swallow it down not think about it and themselves why

58:04.300 --> 58:09.820
are you still buying tickets to my show you're Nazis and themselves you know but

58:09.820 --> 58:15.380
the within five seconds like a nap at the napkin manufacturer would say I go

58:15.380 --> 58:19.940
how's business and they would say like like it's actually it's been up and

58:19.940 --> 58:23.580
down lately and I would be like cutting the person off and going like well yeah

58:23.580 --> 58:26.540
because I get wiping your mouth it's like kind of a zero-sum game and other

58:26.540 --> 58:31.380
type like oh that's just like like my I got that from my mom my mom is great at

58:31.380 --> 58:35.940
it I'm great at it it's not a great thing to be great at it's awful it's a

58:35.940 --> 58:43.820
horrible habit yeah my mother is one of the great I'll tell you what your mom is

58:45.420 --> 58:49.620
and I'll tell you what all moms are

58:49.620 --> 58:57.220
moms on the line pay him a dime give him a nickel a penny or two that's 12 cents

58:57.220 --> 59:04.020

59:29.220 --> 59:35.660
out DJ Khaled randomly I'm a genius say come on rap rapping is ideal idiosyncratic

59:35.660 --> 59:40.220
how do you see him I'm not big I'm not saying it's not good I'm just saying I'm

59:40.220 --> 59:44.180
interested in what it means okay I'm here with the author you know I'm a

59:44.180 --> 59:47.660
little defensive I'm a little defensive I mean I am too I am too I'm totally a

59:47.660 --> 59:52.620
defensive person I hope I'm not speaking out of school you you've engaged in

59:52.620 --> 01:00:09.140
rapping haven't you yeah I did I'm not a good freestyler look don't I yeah I did

01:00:09.140 --> 01:00:12.300
this thing called cracked out for quite a while that was like me and John daily

01:00:12.300 --> 01:00:16.580
that was our thing what was it what I had met familiar with it oh it was it

01:00:16.580 --> 01:00:20.780
wasn't improv though it was like no it was it was scripted I mean it was like

01:00:20.780 --> 01:00:27.820
very very it was problematic I would not do it again it was very very

01:00:27.820 --> 01:00:33.980
short-sighted and near-sighted yeah we would like we would do these rapper

01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:38.740
characters named cracked out in rapzilla and would perform pretty like

01:00:38.740 --> 01:00:45.620
misogynist songs because our whole like justification for it was that we loved

01:00:45.620 --> 01:00:49.820
hip-hop and we were sick of people like doing rapper care white rapper you know

01:00:49.820 --> 01:00:54.220
like comedians doing rappers and like just playing on the like cliche tropes

01:00:54.220 --> 01:01:01.300
like let's create two characters who really embody the flaws of like co-opting

01:01:01.300 --> 01:01:07.180
this music and in this culture and then but it was just an excuse to act like a

01:01:07.180 --> 01:01:11.500
couple of assholes it was so hypocritical and like shitty no we did

01:01:11.500 --> 01:01:17.580
like and then we wear like you know like G unit shirts and do regs and shit it was

01:01:17.580 --> 01:01:24.980
just it was not cool it was very pre 2018 everyone no yeah no I you know I

01:01:24.980 --> 01:01:31.060
kind of want to feel like we should hear you guys both freestyle right now we

01:01:31.060 --> 01:01:35.500
would be terrible we were not like it was not great we tried to rap as you got

01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:40.420
you got a beat for us right rhyme as well as we could oh both of us yeah you and

01:01:40.420 --> 01:01:45.500
me okay he didn't hear you explaining I think he did I think he just just not

01:01:45.500 --> 01:01:52.180
care yeah well yeah it's so it was also like it's lame you know to no we were

01:01:52.180 --> 01:01:55.020
just doing that and then that was like what we were known for we were like we

01:01:55.020 --> 01:02:03.460
should stop this not because it was ignorant in any way yeah because it was

01:02:03.460 --> 01:02:08.740
comedically like well you've got people you know and it was of course like white

01:02:08.740 --> 01:02:12.940
people loved it is there anybody here in the crowd that feels like that they're

01:02:12.940 --> 01:02:18.700
a good freestyling like they can come up and throw it down oh shit we got we got

01:02:18.700 --> 01:02:30.100
we got one confident yes just who is that oh no and against white rappers I'm

01:02:30.100 --> 01:02:37.740
not saying every white rapper it's definitely I felt like I was it is it

01:02:37.740 --> 01:02:43.500
my my perception was the the person that went that very quickly went yeah was

01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:50.060
sitting next to the date who then went no yeah I have to these people don't have

01:02:50.060 --> 01:02:56.020
to get in a car with you I would love it is there a gal here tonight is there a

01:02:56.020 --> 01:03:01.020
woman that can freeze down no white white what no I thought your theory was

01:03:01.020 --> 01:03:05.700
right where she went like oh she was dissing him from the perspective of

01:03:05.700 --> 01:03:09.900
someone who could really rap and knew the true extent of his rapping capabilities

01:03:09.900 --> 01:03:17.020
and was casually slagging him off yeah well that's a fair assessment that may

01:03:17.020 --> 01:03:21.780
well be the case that's the case they both have to come up here and rap you're

01:03:21.780 --> 01:03:27.860
like my my Jiminy sobriety cricket like I can't halfway through the show I'm so

01:03:27.860 --> 01:03:32.780
drunk that when Jeff throws me for a loop I don't even know how to articulate it

01:03:32.780 --> 01:03:39.860
faster than you can I barely I'm just figuring out I was just fantasizing

01:03:39.860 --> 01:03:42.860
that there would be a woman out of the crowd that wants to come up and freestyle

01:03:42.860 --> 01:03:46.820
rap that would be great don't get me wrong yeah it'd be as good as if a guy

01:03:46.820 --> 01:03:51.820
or anybody but I think it would be better but but all of it all of it might be bad

01:03:51.820 --> 01:03:57.140
we don't know anyway anyways Brett Gelman what are you what are you excited

01:03:57.140 --> 01:04:02.740
about working on right now yeah what's new eagle heart what when you're not

01:04:02.740 --> 01:04:07.660
rapping with women what sorry when am I gonna start rapping with women yeah

01:04:07.660 --> 01:04:11.260

01:04:11.260 --> 01:04:21.260
working on ah well when I'm not rapping with women which I never am thank you

01:04:25.940 --> 01:04:33.500
more pointed you know women really huh oh no I don't have I don't it's it's a

01:04:33.500 --> 01:04:38.420
solo you know you know but my girlfriend will but it's scripted

01:04:38.420 --> 01:04:45.220
helping me write it what recording a mixtape or um I don't know what I think

01:04:45.220 --> 01:04:51.620
it'll be an EP and then hopefully and there'll be comedy on that you know on

01:04:51.620 --> 01:04:55.340
there too you know and the songs probably will be comedic and he'll send it to

01:04:55.340 --> 01:04:58.580
like something they'll be like oh my god this is fucking great I'll pay you like

01:04:58.580 --> 01:05:04.700
20 million dollars to fill this out and make it longer which is something that's

01:05:04.700 --> 01:05:08.780
always happens especially in those terms you know people always want it longer

01:05:08.780 --> 01:05:17.060

fallout for replay I am not I there's no excuse for me not watching people's

01:05:57.220 --> 01:06:01.420
shows I just don't do it but for some fucking reason I don't know if it's

01:06:01.420 --> 01:06:06.140
pettiness jealousy laziness what what is it why don't I watch other people's

01:06:06.140 --> 01:06:09.780
shows maybe because you're you spend a lot of time working on a show you don't

01:06:09.780 --> 01:06:13.620
feel like watching like shows that are coming out while yours is coming out I

01:06:13.620 --> 01:06:17.740
think it's awesome yeah it's like because the muscle in your brain that is

01:06:17.740 --> 01:06:23.740
dedicated to appraisal of whether something's funny maybe uh-huh is so

01:06:23.740 --> 01:06:28.700
overactive that you don't want to like someone says you know what's amazing you

01:06:28.700 --> 01:06:31.580
should like if you were yeah it's like like you should go to this class I'm

01:06:31.580 --> 01:06:35.020
doing where we crunch this muscle and you're just like it's a muscle that you

01:06:35.020 --> 01:06:40.420
like that you you you've been shooting like steroids into and you're like I'm

01:06:40.420 --> 01:06:44.620
gonna kill a child right go to that cloud I don't know what I do is think

01:06:44.620 --> 01:06:48.100
about this muscle I don't know how to explain it I just observe my behavior I

01:06:48.100 --> 01:06:53.220
go right why why at this point aren't you want like I I saw an episode of

01:06:53.220 --> 01:06:57.660
Bojack and I was like this is awesome like like clearly I can see I can see

01:06:57.660 --> 01:07:01.220
what all the hubbub's about yeah I've been jealous of Bojack I've never wished

01:07:01.220 --> 01:07:06.580
ill I'm like all my friends are on it I just but I still haven't like been what

01:07:06.580 --> 01:07:10.860
binge-watched Bojack which Cody has therefore I caught a couple episodes and

01:07:10.860 --> 01:07:16.420
right I sit I go oh that's great why did I watch all of Eagle heart why what it

01:07:16.420 --> 01:07:20.140
was I like not threatened by it because you had to do because it was so

01:07:20.140 --> 01:07:26.300
unsuccessful and have ownership this is fucking great nobody's watching it oh

01:07:26.300 --> 01:07:32.500
god I love it I don't it's got quality and no audience perfect combo for me yeah

01:07:32.500 --> 01:07:38.180
no I yeah I don't know yeah I don't always feel like watching things it can

01:07:38.180 --> 01:07:42.900
become it's also like a lot always is just being is airing and being like oh

01:07:42.900 --> 01:07:46.900
you got it I mean that's how so many conversations start these days the oh

01:07:46.900 --> 01:07:51.500
you got to watch this I think it's just a I think it's an it's an it's an

01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:58.300
expression of my workaholism which is not has nothing to do with work ethic its

01:07:58.300 --> 01:08:05.900
relationship with what I consider work and so it's like I yeah I'm like it's

01:08:05.900 --> 01:08:11.620
yeah my colleagues are suffering the symptom of me having an unhealthy

01:08:11.620 --> 01:08:16.900
relationship with what I do it's not big it's not about competition or anything

01:08:16.900 --> 01:08:22.180
as much as I just like I'm like I have some aversion I want to get away from

01:08:22.180 --> 01:08:26.420
my own work as soon as possible and then I like somehow categorize watching new

01:08:26.420 --> 01:08:33.460
girl with my own job which I shouldn't have anything to do with that right new

01:08:33.460 --> 01:08:39.260
girl he said as an example because I was like I should have bonded with it like

01:08:39.260 --> 01:08:43.260
yeah like Liz Merriweather and I like we had shows out at the same time and it

01:08:43.260 --> 01:08:48.140
was like like shit like I was like why am I not watching your show and then like

01:08:48.140 --> 01:08:52.580
I would see a couple episodes because my ex-wife the gathie would be watching

01:08:52.580 --> 01:08:56.740
new girl and I'd like I'd walk through the room and oh that's new girl yeah it's

01:08:56.740 --> 01:09:00.260
delightful I like that no it's a great show no I just yeah and then I wasn't

01:09:00.260 --> 01:09:05.700
just like show no I know you weren't just saying it yeah I why don't I get

01:09:05.700 --> 01:09:11.180
excited why do I'm like I'm my fifth rewatch of my ninth season of forensic

01:09:11.180 --> 01:09:15.580
files like I'm just like like I just just like rape and murder and this is like

01:09:15.580 --> 01:09:18.500
like give me the true crime and the fucking like I'm just like in this

01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:22.700
crazy like right I'm a void it's avoidance it's avoidance of something

01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:27.700
you think so I don't watch comedies like I have no desire to watch like

01:09:27.700 --> 01:09:32.500
successful awesome like funny things I just they don't make me want to watch

01:09:32.500 --> 01:09:37.260
them I'd rather watch this stupid shit more than I would watch people that my

01:09:37.260 --> 01:09:42.100
friends like the shows my friends make right right and it's not out of I don't

01:09:42.100 --> 01:09:46.580
think it's jealousy or like like like distancing myself in that it's like I

01:09:46.580 --> 01:09:51.380
don't want to watch it well I think like maybe maybe it's and I can relate I do

01:09:51.380 --> 01:09:55.620
watch things that my friends make but I sometimes don't feel like and there is

01:09:55.620 --> 01:09:59.740
like an aversion I think it's just because it's all so close to you and

01:09:59.740 --> 01:10:05.060
even though this is our job we still relate to everybody that you want to

01:10:05.060 --> 01:10:09.780
when you watch something escape your life so this these things that are close

01:10:09.780 --> 01:10:14.300
to you by your friends are maybe making you guess not able to escape your life

01:10:14.300 --> 01:10:17.420
as much I guess I don't think it's something to do with engagement too

01:10:17.420 --> 01:10:20.180
though because I don't think it's it's honestly not always like oh my friend

01:10:20.180 --> 01:10:23.980
worked on this or this is the same genre even it's like as we do with

01:10:23.980 --> 01:10:30.140
engagement uh-huh I think it's like like I I pay too much attention to act breaks

01:10:30.140 --> 01:10:36.660
or genre or something like that right where's in forensic files yeah like

01:10:36.660 --> 01:10:42.100
nonfiction and like horror like horror doesn't come anywhere near anything that

01:10:42.100 --> 01:10:47.580
I have ever done for a living so I love horror movies and sci-fi you never want

01:10:47.580 --> 01:10:51.820
to write a horror I mean have you ever wrote up no I've never written anything

01:10:51.820 --> 01:10:57.140
horror my monster house someone someone right you could you could hear in their

01:10:57.140 --> 01:11:01.380
voice halfway through it they regretted it

01:11:01.380 --> 01:11:12.020
they went they went monster huh a great film you know what a great film but not a class not a horror like a

01:11:12.020 --> 01:11:15.940
shot like a Stephen King like yeah like I'm trying to scare you there's an

01:11:15.940 --> 01:11:21.060
Oogity Boogity under your foot right like like I say hold up this is Oogity

01:11:21.060 --> 01:11:25.860
Boogity under your snuggity yeah I think we found the title to your horror movie I

01:11:25.860 --> 01:11:28.780
think it's important I said I think this is important data like if I'm if I'm

01:11:28.780 --> 01:11:35.980
flicking through Apple TV and if I see a thing so if I see cover art for a movie

01:11:35.980 --> 01:11:40.220
that's like a guy and he's got a hose coming out of his head and it says in

01:11:40.220 --> 01:11:46.780
like shitty matrix rip-off font the happening to no I ripped a bad title

01:11:46.780 --> 01:11:50.260
that's distracting there was a happening so I made it to that doesn't help no I

01:11:50.260 --> 01:11:58.020
was at the the con the conduction and and all aboard the dark web or is that

okay why don't we have a scene with John Lithgow and Benicio well I'll be

01:19:20.060 --> 01:19:24.740
John Lithgow I want to do a blind test make your mouth into a circle like a

01:19:24.740 --> 01:19:30.500
lamprey okay but no puck tuck your lips under I can't talk while I'm doing it

01:19:30.500 --> 01:19:36.060

other way around yeah I'll do John Lithgow hey John hey go away go away well

01:19:52.260 --> 01:19:57.420
you see me well you see me what we see John John Lithgow what

01:19:57.420 --> 01:20:02.180
Benicio del Toro I'm your friend oh you're my friend

01:20:02.180 --> 01:20:11.980
I'll flip you I'll flip you for real John I'll flip you let's fight the agony this is new what project I'm working on

01:20:11.980 --> 01:20:19.260
you know what neither of us neither of us can carry this no it's not it's not good

01:20:19.260 --> 01:20:23.780
we're not gonna we need a really bad we need an A-list we need to rehearse this

01:20:23.780 --> 01:20:29.740
we need to get a Brad Pitt involved to help us out here yeah Spencer you want

01:20:29.740 --> 01:20:34.140
to throw some George Clooney on that and we need an A-lister to make this

01:20:34.140 --> 01:20:41.740
story work yeah that sounds good oh you meant an A-lister character not an A-lister

01:20:41.740 --> 01:20:45.700
person doing the impression yeah that's oh geez what did you mean you're filled

01:20:45.700 --> 01:20:49.220
with as much shame as me that's what I thought I meant you I don't think of

01:20:49.220 --> 01:20:56.140
myself in terms of lists right right but my god for you for you to for you to

01:20:56.140 --> 01:20:59.860
hear that that's that amazes me because it's like that's that's a shame projection

01:20:59.860 --> 01:21:03.060
that only I'm capable of where you you heard that as I was like yeah this guy's

01:21:03.060 --> 01:21:08.540
not good enough at improv for us to mount this amazing goal oh I thought that

01:21:08.540 --> 01:21:12.400
you just meant I wasn't famous enough to get away with doing a bad impression

01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:16.220
whereas if Brad Pitt were up here and he was doing terrible Benicio impression

01:21:16.220 --> 01:21:20.140
I don't care it's so amazing you guys are doing fantastic impressions of kind of

01:21:20.140 --> 01:21:24.940
second banana care like character actors we needed like a like an A-lister I was

01:21:24.940 --> 01:21:31.380
saying as the character oh my god I was turning to I was turning to Benicio

01:21:31.380 --> 01:21:36.140
with well there we go again because I see Benicio and John is as A-listers but

01:21:36.140 --> 01:21:39.260
well yeah but I guess they're not I think they both did and also so did the

01:21:39.260 --> 01:21:43.740
producer that put them on set like how are they on set together and finding out

01:21:43.740 --> 01:21:47.620
that they can't carry the movie that was my joke that they're both like this isn't

01:21:47.620 --> 01:21:53.220
going good is it I was blaming the fictional writer and producer of the

01:21:53.220 --> 01:21:57.660
movie but we need someone else in here they themselves are such honest artists

01:21:57.660 --> 01:22:01.380
I think that they would be able to admit that it wasn't going well right they'd

01:22:01.380 --> 01:22:06.140
be like either this needs to be an indie movie about going on a road trip right

01:22:06.140 --> 01:22:13.220
or I would watch or we need to step you know add some talent it sounds like it's

01:22:13.220 --> 01:22:17.540
Jimmy Stewart yes Jimmy yes my child let's go sounds like Jimmy Stewart but

01:22:17.540 --> 01:22:23.820
there is similarities yes there are similarities how about this how about

01:22:23.820 --> 01:22:30.580
this it's a story about it's the biopic of Jimmy Stewart as portrayed by John

01:22:30.580 --> 01:22:36.340
Lefkir and then Benicio plays Benito Benicio Dottaro is strangely the star

01:22:36.340 --> 01:22:42.540
like he's he's he's the he's the A story in the movie as who a manager as his

01:22:42.540 --> 01:22:48.140
manager okay okay so it's set in the 30s okay great like Jimmy Stewart is a he's

01:22:48.140 --> 01:22:54.940
just he's just James Stewart right a bus boy and this is the scene where his

01:22:54.940 --> 01:23:00.460
manager notices him Benicio is the older but Benicio Dottaro plays the

01:23:00.460 --> 01:23:06.740
manager and John Lefkir portrays Benicio Dottaro is playing shell shell

01:23:06.740 --> 01:23:14.540
Supersteam shell Supersteam okay shell Supersteam agent to the stars boy boy

01:23:14.540 --> 01:23:21.940
young adult Jimmy James Stewart's right soon to be manager right right so all

01:23:21.940 --> 01:23:26.980
plays out so you're like you're cleaning dishes and I got Jerry's famous deli and

01:23:26.980 --> 01:23:33.540

01:23:42.980 --> 01:23:46.940
film now it was I mean what are we gonna reverse age John Lithgow like what he

01:23:46.940 --> 01:23:51.780

01:39:03.820 --> 01:39:05.140
Everyone is who they were.

01:39:05.140 --> 01:39:07.460
Wow, you thought we were cutting the Hitler's house, huh?

01:39:07.460 --> 01:39:08.460
Yeah.

01:39:08.460 --> 01:39:11.700
It's like, in fact, I'm a professional screenwriter.

01:39:11.700 --> 01:39:14.380
I'm like, this scene is 18 pages.

01:39:14.380 --> 01:39:15.740
Right, no, it makes sense.

01:39:15.740 --> 01:39:16.540
Where's the monster?

01:39:16.540 --> 01:39:17.300
Where's the house?

01:39:17.300 --> 01:39:19.260
You know, I'm like.

01:39:19.260 --> 01:39:20.860
So in this?

01:39:20.860 --> 01:39:25.700
In this, so Hitler gets announced

01:39:25.700 --> 01:39:30.820
by a German gibberish version of the British national anthem

01:39:30.820 --> 01:39:32.300
whenever he enters his house.

01:39:32.300 --> 01:39:34.380
I'm doing, doing, doing, going.

01:39:34.380 --> 01:39:35.140
Yeah.

01:39:35.140 --> 01:39:40.180
That's his doorbell, and he rings it whenever he opens.

01:39:40.180 --> 01:39:43.020
It is totally act three.

01:39:43.020 --> 01:39:46.900
We are now in Germany, and Jim Stewart is now very famous.

01:39:46.900 --> 01:39:49.740
Oh, gosh, I'm so glad to be Nazi famous.

01:39:49.740 --> 01:39:54.900
I'm an enormous fan of your film work.

01:39:54.900 --> 01:39:58.660
Oh, gosh, I'm very, I'm very upset that.

01:39:58.660 --> 01:40:01.500
Oh, Shell, you should have said something at some point.

01:40:01.500 --> 01:40:03.300
You should have given me some career advice.

01:40:03.300 --> 01:40:06.420
For God's sake, tell me the name of your agent again.

01:40:06.420 --> 01:40:07.420
What is his name?

01:40:07.420 --> 01:40:08.580
Shell Rubin.

01:40:08.580 --> 01:40:11.300
Shell Rubin?

01:40:11.300 --> 01:40:12.300
Shell Rubin.

01:40:12.300 --> 01:40:13.780
Shell Rubin.

01:40:13.780 --> 01:40:14.540
Shell Rubin.

01:40:14.540 --> 01:40:17.100
Rubin, Shell.

01:40:17.100 --> 01:40:19.500
Benicio del Toro, all right?

01:40:19.500 --> 01:40:21.380
No, no, Gerber's Rubik.

01:40:21.380 --> 01:40:22.220
Gerber's Rubik.

01:40:22.220 --> 01:40:23.180
Gerber's Rubik.

01:40:23.180 --> 01:40:24.100
Nice to meet you.

01:40:24.100 --> 01:40:25.340
Can I?

01:40:25.340 --> 01:40:25.940
Nice to meet you.

01:40:25.940 --> 01:40:30.500
That's chairman name of the world, Rubik.

01:40:30.500 --> 01:40:31.660
The human puzzle.

01:40:31.660 --> 01:40:32.500
I'm Gerber's Rubik.

01:40:32.500 --> 01:40:33.180
Nice to meet you.

01:40:33.180 --> 01:40:34.500
Very nice to meet you.

01:40:34.500 --> 01:40:36.140
You know why they call him Rubik?

01:40:36.140 --> 01:40:37.980
He's against mixing colors.

01:40:42.900 --> 01:40:46.460
He thinks everything should be all the same.

01:40:46.460 --> 01:40:49.460
All six sides of your DNA.

01:40:49.460 --> 01:40:49.980
Oh, God.

01:40:49.980 --> 01:40:50.780
She's a Nazi.

01:40:50.780 --> 01:40:51.740
I find that.

01:40:51.740 --> 01:40:52.740
Yeah, that's right.

01:40:52.740 --> 01:40:53.740
Oh, OK.

01:40:53.740 --> 01:41:01.220
I pull Superstine, Rubik aside, and say,

01:41:01.220 --> 01:41:05.540
your friend seems a bit racist.

01:41:05.540 --> 01:41:08.700
He's kind of got to hang up about the mixing of colors.

01:41:08.700 --> 01:41:11.500
I find that personally distasteful.

01:41:11.500 --> 01:41:12.860
You're not?

01:41:12.860 --> 01:41:13.740
You're not racist?

01:41:13.740 --> 01:41:14.500
Huh?

01:41:14.500 --> 01:41:15.140
You're not racist?

01:41:15.140 --> 01:41:16.140
No, I'm not a racist.

01:41:16.140 --> 01:41:18.940
I'm just a, I'm just a, you know, I just want,

01:41:18.940 --> 01:41:20.940
you know, I'm a pragmatist.

01:41:20.940 --> 01:41:21.440
Pfft.

01:41:27.940 --> 01:41:28.940
A pragmatist.

01:41:28.940 --> 01:41:30.060
No, I'm fucking with you.

01:41:30.060 --> 01:41:30.940
I'm totally racist.

01:41:30.940 --> 01:41:31.940
Oh.

01:41:31.940 --> 01:41:33.940
Right, right, right.

01:41:33.940 --> 01:41:37.940
I almost went for that bait and told him I'm really a Jew.

01:41:37.940 --> 01:41:40.660
No, we like to have fun here.

01:41:40.660 --> 01:41:41.420
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:41:41.420 --> 01:41:42.220
That's a berg off.

01:41:42.220 --> 01:41:43.380
We like to have a good time.

01:41:43.380 --> 01:41:46.220
Oh, that's good.

01:41:46.220 --> 01:41:49.060
Wow, look at all these columns.

01:41:49.060 --> 01:41:50.540
Yeah, nice, nice, nice columns.

01:41:50.540 --> 01:41:51.900
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?

01:41:51.900 --> 01:41:53.620
Ah, I mean, what, what, what?

01:41:53.620 --> 01:41:56.020
You want things to look like classic architecture.

01:41:56.020 --> 01:41:58.820
No, you sound, you sound like you're being ironic about that.

01:41:58.820 --> 01:42:01.540
Wow, look, I'd be lying if I said I wanted to, you know,

01:42:01.540 --> 01:42:03.860
thought I'd end up, this is my job.

01:42:03.860 --> 01:42:04.420
I don't know.

01:42:04.420 --> 01:42:06.820
I'm a big friend of neo-classical architecture.

01:42:06.820 --> 01:42:08.100
What is it, what is the problem?

01:42:08.100 --> 01:42:12.700
Yeah, I like washing dishes, but look how we end up.

01:42:12.700 --> 01:42:15.220
Oh, I gotta tell you, Mr. Hitler.

01:42:15.220 --> 01:42:17.180
Can I, can I ask a question, Mr. Stewart?

01:42:17.180 --> 01:42:18.020
Can I ask a question?

01:42:18.020 --> 01:42:19.140
Oh, go shoot away.

01:42:19.140 --> 01:42:24.300
When you were in the death of Liberty Valence.

01:42:24.300 --> 01:42:25.500
Oh, who could forget that?

01:42:25.500 --> 01:42:25.980
Right.

01:42:25.980 --> 01:42:28.260
Oh, what a great picture, wonderful picture.

01:42:28.260 --> 01:42:29.660
We can all agree on something, right?

01:42:29.660 --> 01:42:31.660
What was it like working with?

01:42:37.180 --> 01:42:39.740
When you were in the death of Liberty Valence,

01:42:39.740 --> 01:42:41.740
what was it like working with the great John Wayne?

01:42:41.740 --> 01:42:42.700
I've always wanted to know.

01:42:42.700 --> 01:42:45.060
Oh gosh, you know, John is,

01:42:45.060 --> 01:42:46.940
he's a real trooper.

01:42:46.940 --> 01:42:54.620
And, you know, he liked to play practical jokes on the cast.

01:42:54.620 --> 01:42:59.700
And I'll be gosh darned if he didn't,

01:42:59.700 --> 01:43:03.100
he would always tell you, when you get the trailers,

01:43:03.100 --> 01:43:06.100
they have toilets in them, but they tell you not to use them.

01:43:06.100 --> 01:43:08.980
You know, there's no, there's no water in them.

01:43:08.980 --> 01:43:10.660
It's a dry toilet.

01:43:10.660 --> 01:43:13.140
For God's sake, it's just the trailer, the toilet's there,

01:43:13.140 --> 01:43:15.340
in case it is hooked up to a sump pump.

01:43:15.340 --> 01:43:17.540
I tried to, I tried to get him a bucket of water,

01:43:17.540 --> 01:43:19.460
but they, they wouldn't budge.

01:43:19.460 --> 01:43:24.300
John, John, Mr. John, he took a shit in my trailer,

01:43:24.300 --> 01:43:28.180
and just stuck to the dry plastic.

01:43:28.180 --> 01:43:31.340
And, you know, I had been forewarned.

01:43:31.340 --> 01:43:32.100
Don't do that.

01:43:32.100 --> 01:43:34.300
You're telling me the great John Wayne took a shit

01:43:34.300 --> 01:43:37.500
in your honey wagon shit?

01:43:37.500 --> 01:43:41.260
Yeah, that's why they call him the Duke.

01:43:41.260 --> 01:43:44.780
Dumb, stupid, stupid.

01:43:44.780 --> 01:43:46.980
Because he took a dookie and you know what I'm saying?

01:43:46.980 --> 01:43:48.500
Yeah, you guys, I don't know.

01:43:48.500 --> 01:43:51.980
But as a practical joke, he took a shit in my dry toilet.

01:43:51.980 --> 01:43:53.140
Jimmy, can I talk to you for a second?

01:43:53.140 --> 01:43:54.700
Yeah, yeah, so hold on a second.

01:43:54.700 --> 01:43:56.620
I got to talk to my agent.

01:43:56.620 --> 01:43:57.740
Excuse us.

01:43:57.740 --> 01:43:58.980
So we got to get the fuck out.

01:43:58.980 --> 01:44:00.300
What the fuck are we doing?

01:44:00.300 --> 01:44:02.020
This is Goddamn Nazi Germany.

01:44:02.020 --> 01:44:03.340
What the fuck's going on?

01:44:03.340 --> 01:44:06.820
Well, you said you wanted to try out your new comedy routine

01:44:06.820 --> 01:44:07.740
on a rough crowd.

01:44:07.740 --> 01:44:09.660
The fuck actually, no, I didn't mean that.

01:44:09.660 --> 01:44:12.780
Well, as I was drunk, the most evil person who ever lived.

01:44:12.780 --> 01:44:15.100
You're going to get me the hell out of here.

01:44:15.100 --> 01:44:16.580
OK, all right, I'll think of something.

01:44:16.580 --> 01:44:20.180
Oh, gee whiz.

01:44:20.180 --> 01:44:20.980
Hey, huh?

01:44:20.980 --> 01:44:22.140
Swastikas everywhere.

01:44:22.140 --> 01:44:25.020
Even the cake is shaped like a...

01:44:25.020 --> 01:44:26.540
Just, hey, be an actor.

01:44:26.540 --> 01:44:27.940
I don't even know where to cut it.

01:44:27.940 --> 01:44:31.380
I see you are enjoying my swastikas.

01:44:31.380 --> 01:44:34.020
Oh, yeah.

01:44:34.020 --> 01:44:34.740
Oh, we love them.

01:44:34.740 --> 01:44:35.660
We love them.

01:44:35.660 --> 01:44:36.420
They're wonderful.

01:44:36.420 --> 01:44:41.220
Even to eat them is to be complicit in the deliciousness

01:44:41.220 --> 01:44:42.380
of fascism.

01:44:42.380 --> 01:44:43.260
Yeah, yeah.

01:44:43.260 --> 01:44:44.460
But they're very, very...

01:44:44.460 --> 01:44:48.420
Actually, that symbol is used in some Native American iconography.

01:44:48.420 --> 01:44:49.940
Oh, very good, very good.

01:44:49.940 --> 01:44:53.420
Anyway, no.

01:44:53.420 --> 01:44:57.140
So we are not so very different to me and you, Jimmy Stewart.

01:44:57.140 --> 01:44:57.900
No, no, no.

01:44:57.900 --> 01:44:59.500
Again, we can all agree on something.

01:44:59.500 --> 01:45:00.580
Anyway, Chancellor.

01:45:00.580 --> 01:45:05.500
Mr. Rubick, I have just got some information

01:45:05.500 --> 01:45:08.500
from my security team from the SD.

01:45:08.500 --> 01:45:10.620
I've gone through your 23andMe.

01:45:10.620 --> 01:45:13.100
It turns out that your name is actually Superstite.

01:45:18.580 --> 01:45:21.220
Totally cool, totally cool.

01:45:21.220 --> 01:45:25.580
He's referring to 1923andMe, which is unreliable.

01:45:25.580 --> 01:45:29.020
It's conducted through a can with a string.

01:45:29.020 --> 01:45:30.300
You can deny it.

01:45:30.300 --> 01:45:34.540
Look, Mr. Hitler, that report, it's not true.

01:45:34.540 --> 01:45:35.700
It's not true.

01:45:35.700 --> 01:45:38.340
I had a whole thing with those people.

01:45:38.340 --> 01:45:43.820
I was going to make the biopic on the genesis of 1923andMe,

01:45:43.820 --> 01:45:45.860
but it all fell through and they blamed me for it.

01:45:45.860 --> 01:45:49.180
And so they've been trying to spread around that I'm a Jew,

01:45:49.180 --> 01:45:49.980
but I'm not a Jew.

01:45:49.980 --> 01:45:51.540
My name is not Superstite.

01:45:51.540 --> 01:45:53.020
They made all of that up.

01:45:53.020 --> 01:46:01.500
My name is Gribbles Rubick, and I don't like anything

01:46:01.500 --> 01:46:03.980
that's not white, white, white.

01:46:03.980 --> 01:46:06.580
White and more white, OK?

01:46:06.580 --> 01:46:08.020
All white is all right.

01:46:08.020 --> 01:46:08.620
All white is all right.

01:46:08.620 --> 01:46:09.500
That's what I'm always saying.

01:46:09.500 --> 01:46:10.020
Anyway.

01:46:10.020 --> 01:46:10.780
We should get going.

01:46:10.780 --> 01:46:12.020
Yeah, we got to go.

01:46:12.020 --> 01:46:13.060
We got an Uber.

01:46:13.060 --> 01:46:14.260
We bought an Uber.

01:46:14.260 --> 01:46:14.820
Yeah, we bought an Uber.

01:46:14.820 --> 01:46:16.220
Was that your idea?

01:46:16.220 --> 01:46:16.740
Uber.

01:46:16.740 --> 01:46:17.780
Uber.

01:46:17.780 --> 01:46:20.060
Which was there were every person

01:46:20.060 --> 01:46:22.860
who was named Uber in Germany at this time.

01:46:22.860 --> 01:46:24.660
They drove taxis.

01:46:24.660 --> 01:46:26.660
We've got an Uber good time here.

01:46:26.660 --> 01:46:27.980
It's a special kind of taxi.

01:46:27.980 --> 01:46:30.220
Personally, I don't like the Ubers.

01:46:30.220 --> 01:46:35.020
I prefer the Lyftwaffe.

01:46:35.020 --> 01:46:37.580
Jesus.

01:46:37.580 --> 01:46:39.900
We're just into a weird variety show sketch.

01:46:39.900 --> 01:46:46.100
We're making an America fall in love with Hitler.

01:46:46.100 --> 01:46:47.780
He's just a goofy character.

01:46:47.780 --> 01:46:51.540
23 of me and Uber and Lyft.

01:46:51.540 --> 01:46:54.340
It's like the Benny Hill show.

01:46:54.340 --> 01:46:56.620
All right, well, we're going to get out of here.

01:46:56.620 --> 01:46:59.740
It's important that we get out of here.

01:46:59.740 --> 01:47:02.300
We got to do back in America.

01:47:02.300 --> 01:47:05.020
It's how everybody proud boys meeting.

01:47:08.620 --> 01:47:10.820
We're very proud of us that we met you.

01:47:10.820 --> 01:47:11.620
Proud of everything.

01:47:11.620 --> 01:47:13.620
Proud to meet you.

01:47:13.620 --> 01:47:15.940
You're going to hang out with the proud boys?

01:47:15.940 --> 01:47:17.860
Oh, we love everything.

01:47:17.860 --> 01:47:19.660
You know what we call them here in Germany?

01:47:19.660 --> 01:47:22.140
Regular boys.

01:47:22.140 --> 01:47:26.220
We call them Deutschbags.

01:47:26.220 --> 01:47:31.100
Hitler, you've got to stop franchising you.

01:47:31.100 --> 01:47:34.020
I'm trying to have a good time.

01:47:34.020 --> 01:47:38.420
We're on the risk of making you magwai from the gremlins.

01:47:38.420 --> 01:47:41.300
We're not into gizmo.

01:47:41.300 --> 01:47:42.860
We don't want people to start to wear

01:47:42.860 --> 01:47:45.100
harbored-down t-shirts that have Hitler on them,

01:47:45.100 --> 01:47:51.100
smiling, and he's got to catch phrases that are fun to repeat.

01:47:51.100 --> 01:47:54.860
It may be how this started in real Germany.

01:47:54.860 --> 01:47:58.660
It probably started making fun of his hair and his mustache.

01:47:58.660 --> 01:48:00.420
I didn't even invite you.

01:48:00.420 --> 01:48:02.020
You guys just came to my home.

01:48:02.020 --> 01:48:05.700
I thought, jeez, we got to get out of here.

01:48:05.700 --> 01:48:06.540
Let's get out.

01:48:06.540 --> 01:48:08.340
You couldn't have left any time we wanted.

01:48:08.340 --> 01:48:10.260
We're taking the first zeppelin out of here.

01:48:10.260 --> 01:48:11.100
We don't want to be rude.

01:48:11.100 --> 01:48:11.940
We don't want to be rude.

01:48:11.940 --> 01:48:15.060
We wanted to show you your due respect and whatnot.

01:48:15.060 --> 01:48:15.500
Come on.

01:48:15.500 --> 01:48:17.460
I booked us on the Hindenburg.

01:48:17.460 --> 01:48:18.020
Let's get out of here.

01:48:18.020 --> 01:48:19.260
Oh, yeah, let's go.

01:48:19.260 --> 01:48:19.940
Hindenburg.

01:48:19.940 --> 01:48:25.740
That's too soon.

01:48:25.740 --> 01:48:28.420
Oh, I got your first class tickets.

01:48:28.420 --> 01:48:29.020
Here you go.

01:48:29.020 --> 01:48:29.940
Oh, thank you.

01:48:29.940 --> 01:48:31.820
You don't have to buy me these tickets.

01:48:31.820 --> 01:48:32.740
It's very nice of you.

01:48:32.740 --> 01:48:34.380
You've been a great agent.

01:48:34.380 --> 01:48:36.860
I'm tired of this 10% nonsense.

01:48:36.860 --> 01:48:37.860
I owe you my life.

01:48:37.860 --> 01:48:39.660
I was with washing dishes.

01:48:39.660 --> 01:48:41.340
Now, granted, we took a bit of a detour.

01:48:41.340 --> 01:48:43.460
I don't want to end up in Nazi Germany.

01:48:43.460 --> 01:48:45.100
Of course, and I really don't.

01:48:45.100 --> 01:48:48.580
But even here, aboard the Hindenburg, at least

01:48:48.580 --> 01:48:50.300
I'm not washing dishes.

01:48:50.300 --> 01:48:53.540
Sure, as we go down in flames, yeah, we somehow survive.

01:48:53.540 --> 01:48:57.220
Hey, come on, let's get this cock-sucking blimp moving.

01:48:57.220 --> 01:48:58.740
I don't care what it's filled with.

01:48:58.740 --> 01:49:00.980
Fill it with something lighter than air.

01:49:00.980 --> 01:49:02.180
I don't care what.

01:49:02.180 --> 01:49:05.260
Just fill it with the first inert gas.

01:49:05.260 --> 01:49:09.900
Well, then fill it with a non-inert gas.

01:49:09.900 --> 01:49:11.980
Just fill it with a gas.

01:49:11.980 --> 01:49:14.900
The first one you find on the periodic table.

01:49:14.900 --> 01:49:19.220
Oh, for God's sakes, these fucking crouts.

01:49:19.220 --> 01:49:20.300
Hey, you have a cigarette?

01:49:23.580 --> 01:49:25.340
Yeah, sure, here you go.

01:49:25.340 --> 01:49:28.140
Listen, you crouts, if you don't get this cock-sucking blimp

01:49:28.140 --> 01:49:30.620
moving, what?

01:49:30.620 --> 01:49:31.180
Stop it.

01:49:31.180 --> 01:49:33.340
I'm sick of these Nazi pieces of shit.

01:49:33.340 --> 01:49:35.620
Fill your blimp with a gas.

01:49:35.620 --> 01:49:38.900
The first one you find on the periodic table.

01:49:38.900 --> 01:49:40.700
I don't care how many electrons it needs.

01:49:40.700 --> 01:49:42.700
Jimmy, you're phrasing cock-sucking is negative.

01:49:42.700 --> 01:49:44.380
That's the first mistake there.

01:49:44.380 --> 01:49:46.500
Superstine, how do you think I got where I am?

01:49:46.500 --> 01:49:47.380
Suck and cock.

01:49:50.380 --> 01:49:51.140
I'll tell you this.

01:49:51.140 --> 01:49:54.300
Even more the reason you shouldn't use it in a negative way.

01:49:54.300 --> 01:49:55.220
It's a positive thing.

01:49:55.220 --> 01:49:56.580
It'll help you get to where your career is today.

01:49:56.580 --> 01:49:59.300
You show me a society where you can admit suck and cock,

01:49:59.300 --> 01:50:00.500
and I'll be all out in the open.

01:50:00.500 --> 01:50:02.900
Until then, I've got to say, all aboard.

01:50:10.340 --> 01:50:12.340
This is Mr. Gefford.

01:50:12.340 --> 01:50:14.340
I am a famous radio historian.

01:50:14.340 --> 01:50:17.620
I am here at the Lodger for the Hindenburg, and I'm watching.

01:50:17.620 --> 01:50:18.300
Jimmy, wake up.

01:50:18.300 --> 01:50:18.900
Wake up, Jimmy.

01:50:18.900 --> 01:50:19.540
Wake up.

01:50:19.540 --> 01:50:20.860
Wake up.

01:50:20.860 --> 01:50:22.060
Wake up, Jimmy.

01:50:22.060 --> 01:50:23.420
Wake up.

01:50:23.420 --> 01:50:24.740
Jimmy.

01:50:24.740 --> 01:50:26.420
Jimmy.

01:50:26.420 --> 01:50:28.540
Oh, God.

01:50:28.540 --> 01:50:29.060
Jimmy.

01:50:29.060 --> 01:50:31.380
Michelle, I had a horrible dream.

01:50:31.380 --> 01:50:33.580
I dreamt I wasn't a star at all.

01:50:33.580 --> 01:50:35.020
I was a Nazi.

01:50:35.020 --> 01:50:39.220
You were there, and the Hindenburg was there.

01:50:39.220 --> 01:50:40.580
I'm sorry I didn't wake you sooner.

01:50:40.580 --> 01:50:43.060
It's just you had a massive hard-on.

01:50:43.060 --> 01:50:45.380
So I thought if we were having a pleasurable dream,

01:50:45.380 --> 01:50:47.420
I didn't think it was a nightmare.

01:50:47.420 --> 01:50:50.620
Anyway, I'm sorry.

01:50:50.620 --> 01:50:52.180
Yeah, so it was bad.

01:50:52.180 --> 01:50:53.580
It was bad, the dream.

01:50:53.580 --> 01:50:54.540
Yeah, I mean.

01:50:54.540 --> 01:50:55.540
But I was there.

01:50:55.540 --> 01:50:55.940
Yeah, you were there.

01:50:55.940 --> 01:50:56.820
I was there in your dream.

01:50:56.820 --> 01:50:57.860
You were there.

01:50:57.860 --> 01:50:58.940
I'm that important to you.

01:50:58.940 --> 01:51:00.500
Also, I was there.

01:51:00.500 --> 01:51:00.980
Oh.

01:51:03.860 --> 01:51:07.820
Well, why do you think I'd invite you on this camping trip?

01:51:07.820 --> 01:51:09.980
Why do you think we're all the same tent together?

01:51:09.980 --> 01:51:11.980
Of course, you're all important to me.

01:51:11.980 --> 01:51:14.860
Michelle, Adolf.

01:51:14.860 --> 01:51:15.340
Right.

01:51:15.340 --> 01:51:16.860
Let's get on this fucking cart on.

01:51:16.860 --> 01:51:18.580
It's Goebbels.

01:51:18.580 --> 01:51:19.500
It's Goebbels.

01:51:19.500 --> 01:51:20.660
Oh, you're Goebbels.

01:51:20.660 --> 01:51:22.820
Oh, sorry, sorry, yeah.

01:51:22.820 --> 01:51:26.060
It's kind of damn it.

01:51:26.060 --> 01:51:29.460
I'm going to go get us some firewood.

01:51:29.460 --> 01:51:32.100
All right, well, Adolf, look.

01:51:32.100 --> 01:51:33.380
You know, he's going to get us firewood.

01:51:33.380 --> 01:51:35.860
I got to live with you here.

01:51:35.860 --> 01:51:40.820
I hope there's not going to be any alcohol in this party,

01:51:40.820 --> 01:51:42.220
as I'm tea totaled.

01:51:42.220 --> 01:51:45.220
I don't drink.

01:51:45.220 --> 01:51:46.620
No, there won't be.

01:51:46.620 --> 01:51:47.060
There won't be.

01:51:47.060 --> 01:51:48.700
Just don't drink anything, though.

01:51:48.700 --> 01:51:50.300
Did you know why I don't drink alcohol?

01:51:50.300 --> 01:51:52.860
Why?

01:51:52.860 --> 01:51:55.660
Because I am an angry drunk.

01:51:55.660 --> 01:51:57.580
You're an angry drunk?

01:51:57.580 --> 01:52:01.420
And when you're sober, you're not angry.

01:52:01.420 --> 01:52:02.740
No anger, Wayne.

01:52:02.740 --> 01:52:04.740
These days, or any day recently,

01:52:04.740 --> 01:52:06.500
I'm feeling quite relaxed.

01:52:06.500 --> 01:52:09.340
Is that Jimmy Stewart chopping wood over there?

01:52:09.340 --> 01:52:09.780
Yeah, no.

01:52:09.780 --> 01:52:13.060
He just said he went over to chop wood.

01:52:13.060 --> 01:52:16.220
I got three logs.

01:52:16.220 --> 01:52:18.740
I chopped out a tree and cut it into three logs.

01:52:18.740 --> 01:52:20.660
I used space work.

01:52:20.660 --> 01:52:24.780
But you'd have to subscribe to the podcast to know that.

01:52:24.780 --> 01:52:25.260
Anyway.

01:52:25.260 --> 01:52:28.500
There it is, a backpack with three logs in it.

01:52:28.500 --> 01:52:31.020
Does that show you get a Susanite?

01:52:31.020 --> 01:52:33.780
Say what?

01:52:33.780 --> 01:52:36.860
I said, that should get us Susanite.

01:52:36.860 --> 01:52:37.500
Oh, nice.

01:52:37.500 --> 01:52:40.940
Susanite?

01:52:40.940 --> 01:52:42.940
Who's Susanite?

01:52:42.940 --> 01:52:43.420
What?

01:52:43.420 --> 01:52:45.140
Should I represent her?

01:52:45.140 --> 01:52:45.860
Susanite.

01:52:45.860 --> 01:52:48.300
I said, that should get us through the night.

01:52:48.300 --> 01:52:50.340
Oh, through the night.

01:52:50.340 --> 01:52:54.060
I thought you said that should get us Susanite.

01:52:54.060 --> 01:52:56.300
On my heads in the biz, I'm always thinking of deals.

01:52:56.300 --> 01:52:58.020
I thought for a second that maybe you guys

01:52:58.020 --> 01:53:01.700
were talking about some movie collaboration together.

01:53:01.700 --> 01:53:03.460
Well, I'm going to take one of these logs

01:53:03.460 --> 01:53:06.060
and rub it on the other two and make some fire.

01:53:06.060 --> 01:53:08.700
Right, a real man, a real American here.

01:53:08.700 --> 01:53:10.940
Or I'm sure you can do it too.

01:53:10.940 --> 01:53:16.500
Boy, this is harder than they make it look in the pictures.

01:53:16.500 --> 01:53:17.660
Oh, you've never done it before?

01:53:17.660 --> 01:53:19.540
No, I'm not doing it now.

01:53:19.540 --> 01:53:21.060
It's not working.

01:53:21.060 --> 01:53:23.020
I have to say, this is very good space work

01:53:23.020 --> 01:53:24.060
you're doing, officer.

01:53:24.060 --> 01:53:27.220
Oh, thanks, Hitler.

01:53:27.220 --> 01:53:28.540
Why am I here?

01:53:28.540 --> 01:53:30.860
Why am I here?

01:53:30.860 --> 01:53:31.580
Why am I here?

01:53:31.580 --> 01:53:36.860
Hey, no, we need you here, Superstine.

01:53:36.860 --> 01:53:38.500
Rubik.

01:53:38.500 --> 01:53:39.740
Look, we all know who you are.

01:53:39.740 --> 01:53:41.980
Fine, fine, fine.

01:53:41.980 --> 01:53:44.020
If you're all right with it, I'm all right with it.

01:53:44.020 --> 01:53:45.700
Do you want to know my real name?

01:53:45.700 --> 01:53:47.020
What's your real name?

01:53:47.020 --> 01:53:49.700
Hitler.

01:53:49.700 --> 01:53:52.100
So we can all be friends here in this tent.

01:53:52.100 --> 01:53:53.540
We can all camp together.

01:53:53.540 --> 01:53:54.740
We can all have a good time.

01:53:54.740 --> 01:53:56.580
It's just an agent from Hollywood

01:53:56.580 --> 01:54:01.100
and a famous to-be actor and the potential dictator

01:54:01.100 --> 01:54:03.740
of Nazi Europe.

01:54:03.740 --> 01:54:04.540
We can all just have a good time.

01:54:04.540 --> 01:54:06.740
Oh, this is why you're still chancellor.

01:54:06.740 --> 01:54:07.900
This is why you're still chancellor.

01:54:07.900 --> 01:54:10.100
Oh, gosh, oh, gosh.

01:54:10.100 --> 01:54:11.100
Uh-oh.

01:54:11.100 --> 01:54:11.540
Oh, no.

01:54:11.540 --> 01:54:12.020
Oh, my God.

01:54:12.020 --> 01:54:12.620
Oh, no, it's here.

01:54:12.620 --> 01:54:13.140
Oh, the fire.

01:54:13.140 --> 01:54:13.940
What is happening?

01:54:13.940 --> 01:54:15.020
The fire's too big.

01:54:15.020 --> 01:54:16.500
The fire's too big.

01:54:16.500 --> 01:54:17.380
Oh, my God.

01:54:17.380 --> 01:54:18.260
How do we put the fire out?

01:54:18.260 --> 01:54:18.740
Lighter fluid inside the tent.

01:54:18.740 --> 01:54:22.220
Oh, God, I hate to do this, but here, throw these books.

01:54:22.220 --> 01:54:23.220
Don't get any ideas.

01:54:23.220 --> 01:54:25.580
Throw all the books out the fire.

01:54:25.580 --> 01:54:27.940
Books will put out the fire.

01:54:27.940 --> 01:54:30.020
Why would you throw books on the fire

01:54:30.020 --> 01:54:31.860
to put a fire out?

01:54:31.860 --> 01:54:34.500
Because they're really boring books.

01:54:34.500 --> 01:54:39.140
And I thought it would lure the fire to sleep.

01:54:39.140 --> 01:54:40.700
Oh, God.

01:54:40.700 --> 01:54:41.180
I think you.

01:54:41.180 --> 01:54:42.100
Shell, wake up.

01:54:42.100 --> 01:54:42.580
Shell.

01:54:42.580 --> 01:54:45.420
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

01:54:45.420 --> 01:54:50.020
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

01:54:50.020 --> 01:54:50.980
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

01:54:50.980 --> 01:54:53.420
Wait, what were you going to plug?

01:54:53.420 --> 01:54:54.420
Oh.

01:54:54.420 --> 01:54:55.460
Brett came to plug something.

01:54:55.460 --> 01:54:57.420
Yes.

01:54:57.420 --> 01:55:02.900
Seabroom for rent and check out camping, everyone.

01:55:02.900 --> 01:55:04.100
Rick Yellman, everyone.

01:55:06.780 --> 01:55:08.580
Thank you, guys.

01:55:08.580 --> 01:55:09.580
Spencer Crittenden.

01:55:12.580 --> 01:55:15.540
And let's give it up for Zach on Sound and Nolan

01:55:15.540 --> 01:55:18.460
and Church and Kris Boruff.

01:55:18.460 --> 01:55:20.260
I have everybody here helping us out.

01:55:20.260 --> 01:55:23.700
And the lovely Dynasty type writer.

01:55:23.700 --> 01:55:25.220
I'm your comptroller, Jeff Davis.

01:55:25.220 --> 01:55:27.380
And your mayor, Dan Harmon, everyone.

01:55:34.820 --> 01:55:35.460
Drive fast.

01:55:35.460 --> 01:55:36.020
Take chances.

01:55:53.500 --> 01:55:55.180
Did you get any of that?

01:55:55.180 --> 01:55:57.420
It's a good show.
