an abs I don't want\n\n06:43.780 --> 06:47.420\nto steal your glory or anything but I was laying in bed this morning and I\n\n06:47.420 --> 06:53.300\nlooked down and one thing of my like just one sixth of my stomach look like\n\n06:53.300 --> 06:58.540\nlooked a slight bit defined under the morning light and I was like what is\n\n06:58.540 --> 07:03.860\nhappening is this an ab yeah yeah I think it's like they said as abs they\n\n07:03.860 --> 07:08.540\ncome in they don't come in one ab no it's like hair on your beard you can you\n\n07:08.540 --> 07:14.500\ncan have a quarter ab yeah I think you can have a one pack and also it makes\n\n07:14.500 --> 07:18.260\nsense that when you're on the verge of getting a quarter ab that it's gonna be\n\n07:18.260 --> 07:22.180\nlike poking its head out like a turtle like like it'll be there and then gone\n\n07:22.180 --> 07:26.340\nI'm sure you didn't see one when I lifted my shirt up because I don't see it\n\n07:26.340 --> 07:32.140\nevery every time right I'm slowly like it's gonna keep the frequency with which\n\n07:32.140 --> 07:38.580\nyou can see it will increase and by 2023 I'm gonna I I've revised my goals I'm\n\n07:38.580 --> 07:42.420\nnot gonna look like Chris Pratt by January that's not happening I'm\n\n07:42.420 --> 07:46.020\nconvinced that there's CG and steroids involved in that process and then I won't\n\n07:46.020 --> 07:51.300\nI won't touch I'm not high-roading him I just think that it's it's a lie and but\n\n07:51.300 --> 08:01.500\nmy new goal is original Captain Kirk back in the day nice when you just that\n\n08:01.500 --> 08:10.540\nkind of or like Bill Gerard Buck Rogers yeah like when you when a man\n\n08:10.540 --> 08:14.540\nwould take his shirt off if he was the lead in a show but he could just he could\n\n08:14.540 --> 08:19.740\njust have the torso it looked like a can of soup it just looked like a cylinder\n\n08:19.740 --> 08:26.380\nand that was considered being fit yeah the absence of anything flowing over\n\n08:26.380 --> 08:30.140\nthe belt was okay and also they would just wear these big belts like what\n\n08:30.140 --> 08:33.420\nthey're they'd take their shirt off because like the insect queen would I\n\n08:33.420 --> 08:37.940\ndemand a gladiator for my satisfaction and then the gladiator outfit would\n\n08:37.940 --> 08:46.140\nconveniently involve a belt the size of a shirt who is that handsome specimen he\n\n08:46.140 --> 08:57.020\nis an earth man impressive yes you guys don't know how to get down get down I'm\n\n08:57.020 --> 09:01.020\nafraid I don't know what you mean this is the 25th century\n\n09:01.020 --> 09:11.820\nget down Buck Rogers we've discussed this before if you watch the pilot for\n\n09:11.820 --> 09:17.100\nBuck Rogers what watch it and indulge me in a theory I've never looked this up\n\n09:17.100 --> 09:22.380\nI'd rather just entertain the theory if you watch it there was a show in the\n\n09:22.380 --> 09:27.420\n80s called Buck Rogers it was there was this guy tweaky it had a penis head it\n\n09:27.420 --> 09:34.140\nwas a little little robot that had a penis helmet head thing and if you watch\n\n09:34.140 --> 09:42.060\nthe pilot it seems clear to me that the character of tweaky was not voiced by\n\n09:42.060 --> 09:46.060\nMel blank as he became like that's what tweaky became as Buck Rogers would go\n\n09:46.060 --> 09:51.540\ncome on give me five tweaky and tweaky would go that's right but like get down\n\n09:51.540 --> 09:55.460\nand then but I think if you watch the pilot it's clear that this like thing\n\n09:55.460 --> 09:59.300\nit's just supposed to walk around but then they because it's not doing anything\n\n09:59.300 --> 10:03.020\nbut then they like they watched it in post and I think the producers were like\n\n10:03.020 --> 10:07.060\nthis fucking sucks like what is this little dick robot walking around and\n\n10:07.060 --> 10:12.180\nthen they brought in the voice of the bugs bunny and he's just walking around\n\n10:12.180 --> 10:16.380\ndoing nothing but he's saying random shit that's like squeezed in between other\n\n10:16.380 --> 10:20.980\ndialogues and they don't establish it doesn't say like oh I spent I spent the\n\n10:20.980 --> 10:25.420\nnight crossing his circuits or I spilt some micolobe on his circuit board oh\n\n10:25.420 --> 10:30.740\nyou've infected our robot with 20th century jargon there's no addressing it\n\n10:30.740 --> 10:34.900\nat all it's just that the robot is just like going like me that's getting jiggy\n\n10:34.900 --> 10:37.860\nwith it but it's like walking through and they're like what the fuck is he do I\n\n10:37.860 --> 10:44.620\nsay that wait for real that he would say look modern stuff you think that was\n\n10:44.620 --> 10:49.100\nlike I think it was an afterthought I think I think that was a pilot and then\n\n10:49.100 --> 10:52.140\nbefore they got the pilot pickup or after they got the pilot pick up before\n\n10:52.140 --> 10:56.940\nthey shot the rest of the shit they retooled the character in post by adding\n\n10:56.940 --> 11:01.340\nlike what if he was saying all the crazy 20th century shit what I that's my\n\n11:01.340 --> 11:05.380\ntheory just watch it see if you agree or look it up which I refuse to do because\n\n11:05.380 --> 11:09.340\nwho cares what you learn the truth who cares his name was is it was tweaky yeah\n\n11:09.340 --> 11:15.180\ncome on man yeah his name was tweaky I mean that that's 21st century he's\n\n11:15.180 --> 11:19.340\nfucking he's just a meth fucking

like come on\n\n15:31.580 --> 15:36.860\njudge it judge it judge it do you think it's really a coincidence that the\n\n15:36.860 --> 15:40.140\npeople that are the most passionate about animals are they have the worst\n\n15:40.140 --> 15:45.540\nsocial skills in the world like like do we really I mean can we not talk about\n\n15:45.540 --> 15:48.940\nthat I just you don't have to hate animals to observe the fact that the\n\n15:48.940 --> 15:52.660\npeople that love them so much that they get angry and spit in your face are like\n\n15:52.660 --> 15:55.980\nI don't know what chicken laid what egg but I bet they could tell you what a\n\n15:55.980 --> 16:01.620\nchicken shouldn't do and and do you don't you think that it's possible that\n\n16:01.620 --> 16:07.060\nthat cycle started before they do you think that they were like super chill\n\n16:07.060 --> 16:11.700\nand tactful people that were like definitely had like supreme interfacing\n\n16:11.700 --> 16:15.620\nand networking skills with their colleagues and their species and then\n\n16:15.620 --> 16:21.340\nthey gave all of that up when they realized how important animals were or\n\n16:21.340 --> 16:26.060\ndo you think it might be the other way around we're allowed to say that about\n\n16:26.060 --> 16:31.900\nvideo games ships and bottles stamp collecting like we we we all it'll go\n\n16:31.900 --> 16:37.860\nlike

steam\n\n17:02.380 --> 17:05.780\nengine while you're saying it with two hammers or something you have to like\n\n17:05.780 --> 17:11.660\nrisk something you can't just be like I love that dog yeah we

owned by the Genji Cohen we\n\n19:47.060 --> 19:50.060\nwere picking a you had been here already you were yeah you were in the\n\n19:50.060 --> 19:53.220\ncupboards when we were touring the house right what's this is Brett Gilman's\n\n19:53.220 --> 19:58.900\nin here uh-huh yeah I did a bunch of shows here when it when it first was\n\n19:58.900 --> 20:04.460\nopening I love it here and but then it was just whoa way too demanding way too\n\n20:04.460 --> 20:10.100\ndemanding what did I miss by not seeing your show um there would always be a\n\n20:10.100 --> 20:16.700\ntheme and it would it would somewhat relate to that theme and I just basically\n\n20:16.700 --> 20:27.980\nbe an asshole for two hours and no like I showed well my mother when I was when\n\n20:27.980 --> 20:34.940\nI was a bar mitzvah age she sent these letters out to all of these comedians\n\n20:34.940 --> 20:39.580\nthat she got like this big address book from this dude in Vegas like when you\n\n20:39.580 --> 20:44.420\nwere a kid like she was a kid yeah and I mean I always wanted to do you want to\n\n20:44.420 --> 20:50.700\ndrink by the way no I'm okay thank you thank you so much I mean I want one

physically\n\n20:59.340 --> 21:03.980\nallergic to it oh no I can't do it so you get all red in the Jewish I know the\n\n21:03.980 --> 21:10.980\nJewish organs start to shut down in breeding people in breeding not a lot\n\n21:10.980 --> 21:16.300\nof people in the shtetl in the old country you had to compromise you lucked\n\n21:16.300 --> 21:19.540\nout you know you know you don't you don't want you don't want a hollow leg\n\n21:19.540 --> 21:23.420\ngenetically I don't think that's like a gift right no it'll help you win a\n\n21:23.420 --> 21:28.700\ncouple contests from the ages of 30 to 40 but the rest is all credit card debt\n\n21:28.700 --> 21:33.460\nand if there's anything I do it's win contests just mean like the old thing\n\n21:33.460 --> 21:37.180\nyou know like we were like oh he drank I drank him under the table and stuff like\n\n21:37.180 --> 21:40.820\nthat all right you get a couple of thrills you're like Jesus Christ I can't\n\n21:40.820 --> 21:44.260\nbelieve how I fucking drank that dude under the table right right like you\n\n21:44.260 --> 21:48.500\nget like three of those and then the rest is just you have like I think it\n\n21:48.500 --> 21:54.620\nseems the the ethnicities that are that can hold their liquor the best seem to\n\n21:54.620 --> 21:59.260\nalso have these eraser moles that grow off of their body uh-huh yeah it's like\n\n21:59.260 --> 22:02.620\nan Eastern European thing right anyway sorry what were you talking about no I\n\n22:02.620 --> 22:07.500\ngot your mom your mom I got some skin tags too though I do have some skin\n\n22:07.500 --> 22:12.540\ntags so I'm fucked on that that count as well no but she sent letters to all\n\n22:12.540 --> 22:17.300\nof these comedians with and she got their head shots too from this guy right\n\n22:17.300 --> 22:21.700\nand sent them a letter you're my son's favorite comedian will you sign this\n\n22:21.700 --> 22:26.260\npicture and put in the self-adressed envelope because your mom was like like\n\n22:26.260 --> 22:30.820\nJewish connections and stuff it was all about yeah she was like and will you\n\n22:30.820 --> 22:36.140\nhire him someday right yeah well you make his pay equal to yours was your\n\n22:36.140 --> 22:41.740\nmom in the business not at all not at all what did she do well I guess in a\n\n22:41.740 --> 22:46.340\nway she's in the business she's an agent for photographers for advertising but I\n\n22:46.340 --> 22:50.420\ndon't think was she doing that no she was I think by the time I was bar mitzvah\n\n22:50.420 --> 22:55.180\nshowbiz adjacent she was definitely showbiz adjacent the smell of the lime\n\n22:55.180 --> 22:59.180\nin the limelight right and she contributes to the agency that tells\n\n22:59.180 --> 23:03.140\nshowbiz what to do right the advertising agency she certainly knows as a\n\n23:03.140 --> 23:07.060\nphotographer she's like look I could point this thing at a daddy long legs or\n\n23:07.060 --> 23:13.060\na mountain right and I'll either be Ansel Adams or Oprah exactly I don't I don't\n\n23:13.060 --> 23:19.060\neither way I win I don't know who's very long legs bonus oh no Oprah actually\n\n23:19.060 --> 23:28.060\nshe was a series of famous Daddy long legs in her book take a walk daddy my\n\n23:28.060 --> 23:33.060\njourney from passion to professionalism she talks about the heartache of having\n\n23:33.060 --> 23:36.260\nto turn your back on what you're truly good at really fulfills you for what\n\n23:36.260 --> 23:39.180\nmakes money and she was like I was never born to be a talk show host I love\n\n23:39.180 --> 23:43.700\ntaking photos of Daddy long legs yeah no in her rider whenever she's a guest\n\n23:43.700 --> 23:48.780\nanywhere it's in a rider that there are 20 Daddy long legs in her dressing room\n\n23:48.780 --> 23:53.140\nalong with three different kinds of cameras and that's how she warms up\n\n23:53.140 --> 23:56.860\napparently she's one of those snobs that'll quickly remind you that those\n\n23:56.860 --> 24:03.140\naren't spiders yeah and sure and if you if you even go near that fucking myth\n\n24:03.140 --> 24:06.700\nabout how they're actually the most toxic insect in the world is that not\n\n24:06.700 --> 24:10.900\ntrue yeah it's totally not true oh really yeah it's one of those things like the\n\n24:10.900 --> 24:14.620\nhundredth monkey thing or the it's just like you know it's not true so you don't\n\n24:14.620 --> 24:18.460\nlook it up and then you look it up and of course it's not true what happens to\n\n24:18.460 --> 24:23.940\nevery hundredth monthly well I just want to share in case they haven't heard like\n\n24:23.940 --> 24:27.700\nit's a fun myth the idea that Daddy long legs you guys know what Daddy long\n\n24:27.700 --> 24:32.700\nlegs are right everybody knows that they are the the the myth was is that they\n\n24:32.700 --> 24:37.500\nthey have they have their poisonous but and they actually their poison is\n\n24:37.500 --> 24:42.560\nactually could kill you it's actually the most toxic poison per drop right\n\n24:42.560 --> 24:47.660\nbut there's stingers but they can't penetrate human skin so if they ever were\n\n24:47.660 --> 24:53.020\nto try to kill you they would just never be like giving the the son of Sam a\n\n24:53.020 --> 24:57.420\nwiffleball bat like a monkey though what's the monkey one what's that what's\n\n24:57.420 --> 25:00.340\nthe hundredth monkey okay the hundredth monkey thing Jeff you know that yeah\n\n25:00.340 --> 25:06.700\nyou introduce me that one that's the theory that that there was monkeys on an\n\n25:06.700 --> 25:12.180\nisland and they'd learned how to take a potato and they found out there was a\n\n25:12.180 --> 25:19.180\nstar you to do you want me to grab it grab you like grab this baby I want\n\n25:19.180 --> 25:22.320\nyou to ration and grab it seems like your pinchers aren't penetrating my\n\n25:22.320 --> 25:27.780\nepidermis like I know the information you got could fuck about my mind I'm not\n\n25:27.780 --> 25:31.260\nfeeling the pinchers that was the Daddy long legs of information the idea that\n\n25:31.260 --> 25:35.900\nany any community of animals that start learning one new trait that across the\n\n25:35.900 --> 25:40.100\nworld right there's no way they could have communicated it was a it was a it\n\n25:40.100 --> 25:45.660\nwas a it was a it was a the legend was that there was a anthropological or\n\n25:45.660 --> 25:53.900\nwhatever you call it when it's monkeys a moncological primatological like watch\n\n25:53.900 --> 25:57.180\ntower like it was like in an archipelago or something they're like\n\n25:57.180 --> 26:00.940\nmonitoring this monkey population and the monkey population would eat potatoes\n\n26:00.940 --> 26:07.900\nand then and then they they observed a monkey like dropping its potato in some\n\n26:07.900 --> 26:13.260\nsaltwater and then get fishing it out and eating it and then observed it like\n\n26:13.260 --> 26:18.660\nbeing blown away by both the cleaner potato and a salted potato and then\n\n26:18.660 --> 26:23.340\nobserved it teaching a friend monkey all of this scans with what we know about\n\n26:23.340 --> 26:26.340\nmonkeys they're actually quite smart they could write Hamlet if you gave them\n\n26:26.340 --> 26:32.700\nenough time and space and typewriters the the but then the the the hundredth\n\n26:32.700 --> 26:37.780\nmonkey principle is sort of a pop science like x-factor principle that\n\n26:37.780 --> 26:42.300\nsays that these people were watching this group of monkeys on one island and\n\n26:42.300 --> 26:48.020\nthat when the hundredth monkey learned to wash their potato that spontaneously\n\n26:48.020 --> 26:53.820\nan unrelated research or unconnected like research tower watching the same\n\n26:53.820 --> 26:58.980\nspecies but a completely unconnected island of monkeys that they spontaneously\n\n26:58.980 --> 27:05.780\nbegan washing their potatoes without any causal thing so the hundredth monkey\n\n27:05.780 --> 27:13.540\nconcept is the idea of genetic Wi-Fi of like every learned but it's a myth but\n\n27:13.540 --> 27:19.340\nit's a myth that never happened every hundredth monkey is psychic\n\n27:20.340 --> 27:28.900\nI think it's the idea that that like evolutionary like wise like when enough\n\n27:28.900 --> 27:36.100\nof a community learn something it becomes global because like it was like an\n\n27:36.100 --> 27:39.140\nevolutionary thing it was going to happen anyway yeah I think the idea would\n\n27:39.140 --> 27:42.100\nbe with some of this stuff which I think it's important to stay open to because\n\n27:42.100 --> 27:48.700\nGod knows before Einstein they they believed in this shit called the ether\n\n27:48.700 --> 27:52.500\nthey had to it's what filled in all of the blank spaces when there's that many\n\n27:52.500 --> 27:57.660\nblank spaces why does light behave this way so scientists in the modern world a\n\n27:57.660 --> 28:04.100\nworld that had gasoline watches not quite television but boy if you saw one\n\n28:04.100 --> 28:07.860\nof these people in a time travel town like you wouldn't they wouldn't be an\n\n28:07.860 --> 28:12.740\nalien this is like fucking 20s and people believed in this like interstellar\n\n28:12.740 --> 28:17.220\njelly that we couldn't see or detect called the ether that was the thing\n\n28:17.220 --> 28:22.700\nthat explained why if you turn on your flashlight in a box car that's traveling\n\n28:22.700 --> 28:27.260\nthat the that a person observing the box car will see the light that I'd move at\n\n28:27.260 --> 28:29.980\ndifferent whatever the fuck that whatever the whatever the whatever the\n\n28:29.980 --> 28:33.300\nwhatever the blank spaces were and all the questions that we needed to answer\n\n28:33.300 --> 28:37.860\nabout light I don't honestly I can't wrap my brain around even the questions\n\n28:37.860 --> 28:41.140\nthat they're asking so I don't blame them for inventing this thing called the\n\n28:41.140 --> 28:45.820\nether they're like well that's the ether they would say when you if you if you\n\n28:45.820 --> 28:52.140\nif you're driving in a box car that it's it's filled with ether which we can't\n\n28:52.140 --> 28:55.780\nwe can't measure it doesn't weigh anything it's just like this jelly that\n\n28:55.780 --> 28:59.460\ntravels with the box car well why are people why are people driving in box\n\n28:59.460 --> 29:03.540\ncars so like because it's because they didn't because they were trying to\n\n29:03.540 --> 29:07.860\nillustrate that you know you know the old stand-up joke if you're traveling at\n\n29:07.860 --> 29:11.780\nthe speed of light in your car and you turn the headlights on what happens so\n\n29:11.780 --> 29:15.260\nlike that's an it starts with a legitimate question that they really had\n\n29:15.260 --> 29:19.820\nwhat happens well theoretically would yeah I don't know do the headlights fall\n\n29:19.820 --> 29:24.580\noff do you does the do you get younger just the light turn into a candle that\n\n29:24.580 --> 29:29.580\njoke who did that joke we did it first yeah that's nine I think I feel like I\n\n29:29.580 --> 29:43.660\nthink it was Paul Rodriguez the speed of light in my barrio was anyways the you\n\n29:43.660 --> 29:48.060\nknow it seems like a Stephen Wright like I thought it was maybe Stephen Wright but\n\n29:48.060 --> 29:53.540\nyeah anyways god damn it whatever but I'm saying like people make up fairy tales\n\n29:53.540 --> 29:59.140\nthe scientific community makes up that's why it's so annoying whenever\n\n29:59.140 --> 30:04.900\nanybody proposes science in terms of an argument for something because I mean\n\n30:04.900 --> 30:09.580\nno it's not always annoying actually it's quite essential these days we're\n\n30:09.580 --> 30:14.380\nactually I mean the opposite of what I just said\n\n30:14.380 --> 30:24.820\nyeah no I mean we should never mind I'm not even going to I do have a point\n\n30:24.820 --> 30:28.700\nbeyond that point but I I'm not gonna even make it because I need to support\n\n30:28.700 --> 30:33.180\nscience right now fully and utterly no listen to science science is right\n\n30:33.180 --> 30:39.660\nhundred percent let's go with science try that on for size world and United\n\n30:39.660 --> 30:44.740\nStates yeah I think science is having a pretty good year right now you think so\n\n30:44.740 --> 30:49.300\nscience is having a good run they're definitely they're definitely heroes\n\n30:49.300 --> 30:55.700\nright yeah like they're like the way Han Solo was in the end of Empire yeah\n\n30:55.700 --> 30:59.740\nyeah yeah oh no totally definitely our favorite character walking out of the\n\n30:59.740 --> 31:06.820\ntheater yeah very sad point right oh yeah it's got frozen in carbon I mm-hmm yeah\n\n31:06.820 --> 31:16.020\nbut right before it did it said I know too I love you maybe yeah maybe maybe one\n\n31:16.020 --> 31:21.260\nof us need to dress up like Princess Leia did we have to scam science free\n\n31:21.260 --> 31:25.660\nright we have to stop taking the high road I do think we actually extend this\n\n31:25.660 --> 31:30.060\nmetaphor I hope when science thaws out it is as big a pussy as Han Solo was in\n\n31:30.060 --> 31:36.100\nJedi sorry for using pussy as a pejorative but it's a the the the because\n\n31:36.100 --> 31:41.940\nscience like is all that science needs to if we if we survive this culture war\n\n31:41.940 --> 31:45.940\nyeah I would like to see one of the side effects be that science just in\n\n31:45.940 --> 31:51.740\ngeneral not scientists not each individual scientist but if like a two-way\n\n31:51.740 --> 31:56.180\nagreement between people in science which says you know what this is a\n\n31:56.180 --> 32:01.940\nreligion in the sense that it is a connection to the unknown and therefore\n\n32:01.940 --> 32:09.300\nyou can't necessarily be science and simultaneously say I don't care I don't\n\n32:09.300 --> 32:12.860\nknow what happens I don't care what happens who gives a shit it's not my job\n\n32:12.860 --> 32:18.100\nyou know what I mean like right like it we are lost little lambs because we did\n\n32:18.100 --> 32:25.460\na long time ago agree to trust in science over all this other Michigas the\n\n32:25.460 --> 32:30.500\nright we in spite of what we see every day that frustrates us we have as a\n\n32:30.500 --> 32:37.900\nspecies decided to be humanist and and be like look I'm not gonna believe things\n\n32:37.900 --> 32:40.660\nthat people that threaten to burn you at the stake tell me to believe I'm gonna\n\n32:40.660 --> 32:46.900\nbelieve the people looking through telescopes right and so we since we're\n\n32:46.900 --> 32:52.660\nobviously not gonna spontaneously develop a culture that saves us that\n\n32:52.660 --> 32:55.620\nchills us to be good people and since we no longer want to base that on whether\n\n32:55.620 --> 32:59.860\nyou go to heaven or hell like the next step is we have to become like Vulcan\n\n32:59.860 --> 33:04.420\nyou know like and and we need a science Jesus science we need a science Jesus\n\n33:04.420 --> 33:08.780\nyeah who won't act like Jesus he'll because he'll be like I don't want to\n\n33:08.780 --> 33:14.540\nget crucified I'm a scientist all of my data shows that will hurt and will kill\n\n33:14.540 --> 33:21.540\nme and I all I ask is for you to think about that for a second empathy is\n\n33:21.540 --> 33:28.340\nscientifically right like proven to solve our problems communication honesty\n\n33:28.340 --> 33:32.340\nlike so maybe connect some of these things that we currently look at as\n\n33:32.340 --> 33:37.380\nbeing like moralistic and disconnect morality from this other thing that we\n\n33:37.380 --> 33:42.700\ncall religion yeah so that we can finally be like like it's like we still\n\n33:42.700 --> 33:48.180\nconnect we still connect the concept of atheism to like a morality like it's\n\n33:48.180 --> 33:52.100\nstill getting done it still gets done in your head we gotta we gotta we gotta we\n\n33:52.100 --> 33:59.060\ngotta fix that I feel like I feel like Spencer is our science Jesus oh shit you\n\n33:59.060 --> 34:04.900\nguys you're in trouble buddy I got a box car full of ether out back\n\n34:08.140 --> 34:11.180\nyeah\n\n34:12.540 --> 34:18.980\nI mean wow what a science Jesus wow and the street value of ether is really\n\n34:18.980 --> 34:24.460\nthrough the roof now that it's been disproven I know you can't make more the\n\n34:24.460 --> 34:29.300\nbad news is we were wrong about the ether the good news is we got a fucking\n\n34:29.300 --> 34:38.900\nton of it everybody let's get not someone has quailudes right is either\n\n34:38.900 --> 34:43.340\nthe new quailudes or it was back then quailudes are the new ether right but\n\n34:43.340 --> 34:50.580\nalso those are gone what about what about poppers you guys do poppers like\n\n34:50.580 --> 34:58.220\njalapeno or amelonitrate jalapeno or amelonitrate I did it once at a bar that\n\n34:58.220 --> 35:03.820\nsaid that the cleaning fluid right I don't know that could be that I'll take\n\n35:03.820 --> 35:09.140\nanything tape had tape had cleaning was the 80s like it was like the DIY I\n\n35:09.140 --> 35:13.140\nremember it was the door the movie the doors where I first saw a popper and I\n\n35:13.140 --> 35:16.380\nwas like what is that I still don't know that's why I bring it up at comedy\n\n35:16.380 --> 35:20.900\nshow you know it's like a thing that you release in your dad had like cleaning\n\n35:20.900 --> 35:25.660\nfluid for for videotape that's that's you can and you could buy that no that's\n\n35:25.660 --> 35:28.420\nnot amelonitrate that I know of I don't know if it's like related the way\n\n35:28.420 --> 35:36.420\nSudafed is related to math or whatever but but like I just always find out I\n\n35:36.420 --> 35:40.900\nknow the two things that I know the one thing that those two things have in\n\n35:40.900 --> 35:48.740\ncommon why is that they but they're supposedly dilate your butthole like\n\n35:48.740 --> 35:53.780\namelonitrate poppers and like and huffing tape head cleaner there were\n\n35:53.780 --> 35:59.540\nthese things called tapes and these things called buttholes that we believe\n\n35:59.540 --> 36:09.700\nneeded to be dilated back in the early 80s your butt had holes it would be good\n\n36:09.700 --> 36:15.220\nI mean what a great thing if you're constipated yeah but do you think if you\n\n36:15.220 --> 36:19.260\ndilate your butt and you're constipated do you think the turd just falls out like\n\n36:19.260 --> 36:25.100\nyou're probably right we're not horses yeah yeah I don't know if it's like when\n\n36:25.100 --> 36:29.100\nyou're probably not what happens to horses either it looks like that that\n\n36:29.100 --> 36:32.900\ntheir assholes just opening and shit drops out but no there's probably a\n\n36:32.900 --> 36:35.740\npushing that's coming there's definitely a pushing that's going on there's a\n\n36:35.740 --> 36:39.860\ndigestive tract and I'm sure I wouldn't be just falling out with horses and\n\n36:39.860 --> 36:42.660\nelephants because they're just they're literally eating fiber that's all they\n\n36:42.660 --> 36:48.980\neat yeah they're like taking in so much fiber yeah but I did okay why what we\n\n36:48.980 --> 36:51.700\ndon't have to talk about this but I what I did actually come to think of it I\n\n36:51.700 --> 36:56.460\nwas severely constipated once because I was on the Atkins diet and I told this\n\n36:56.460 --> 37:01.900\nstory here before where I had I had a softball sized oof how do I put this\n\n37:01.900 --> 37:07.500\nturd yeah like like like reaching like like like like crowning

don't I yeah I did\n\n01:00:09.140 --> 01:00:12.300\nthis thing called cracked out for quite a while that was like me and John daily\n\n01:00:12.300 --> 01:00:16.580\nthat was our thing what was it what I had met familiar with it oh it was it\n\n01:00:16.580 --> 01:00:20.780\nwasn't improv though it was like no it was it was scripted I mean it was like\n\n01:00:20.780 --> 01:00:27.820\nvery very it was problematic I would not do it again it was very very\n\n01:00:27.820 --> 01:00:33.980\nshort-sighted and near-sighted yeah we would like we would do these rapper\n\n01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:38.740\ncharacters named cracked out in rapzilla and would perform pretty like\n\n01:00:38.740 --> 01:00:45.620\nmisogynist songs because our whole like justification for it was that we loved\n\n01:00:45.620 --> 01:00:49.820\nhip-hop and we were sick of people like doing rapper care white rapper you know\n\n01:00:49.820 --> 01:00:54.220\nlike comedians doing rappers and like just playing on the like cliche tropes\n\n01:00:54.220 --> 01:01:01.300\nlike let's create two characters who really embody the flaws of like co-opting\n\n01:01:01.300 --> 01:01:07.180\nthis music and in this culture and then but it was just an excuse to act like a\n\n01:01:07.180 --> 01:01:11.500\ncouple of assholes it was so hypocritical and like shitty no we did\n\n01:01:11.500 --> 01:01:17.580\nlike and then we wear like you know like G unit shirts and do regs and shit it was\n\n01:01:17.580 --> 01:01:24.980\njust it was not cool it was very pre 2018 everyone no yeah no I you know I\n\n01:01:24.980 --> 01:01:31.060\nkind of want to feel like we should hear you guys both freestyle right now we\n\n01:01:31.060 --> 01:01:35.500\nwould be terrible we were not like it was not great we tried to rap as you got\n\n01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:40.420\nyou got a beat for us right rhyme as well as we could oh both of us yeah you and\n\n01:01:40.420 --> 01:01:45.500\nme okay he didn't hear you explaining I think he did I think he just just not\n\n01:01:45.500 --> 01:01:52.180\ncare yeah well yeah it's so it was also like it's lame you know to no we were\n\n01:01:52.180 --> 01:01:55.020\njust doing that and then that was like what we were known for we were like we\n\n01:01:55.020 --> 01:02:03.460\nshould stop this not because it was ignorant in any way yeah because it was\n\n01:02:03.460 --> 01:02:08.740\ncomedically like well you've got people you know and it was of course like white\n\n01:02:08.740 --> 01:02:12.940\npeople loved it is there anybody here in the crowd that feels like that they're\n\n01:02:12.940 --> 01:02:18.700\na good freestyling like they can come up and throw it down oh shit we got we got\n\n01:02:18.700 --> 01:02:30.100\nwe got one confident yes just who is that oh no and against white rappers I'm\n\n01:02:30.100 --> 01:02:37.740\nnot saying every white rapper it's definitely I felt like I was it is it\n\n01:02:37.740 --> 01:02:43.500\nmy my perception was the the person that went that very quickly went yeah was\n\n01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:50.060\nsitting next to the date who then went no yeah I have to these people don't have\n\n01:02:50.060 --> 01:02:56.020\nto get in a car with you I would love it is there a gal here tonight is there a\n\n01:02:56.020 --> 01:03:01.020\nwoman that can freeze down no white white what no I thought your theory was\n\n01:03:01.020 --> 01:03:05.700\nright where she went like oh she was dissing him from the perspective of\n\n01:03:05.700 --> 01:03:09.900\nsomeone who could really rap and knew the true extent of his rapping capabilities\n\n01:03:09.900 --> 01:03:17.020\nand was casually slagging him off yeah well that's a fair assessment that may\n\n01:03:17.020 --> 01:03:21.780\nwell be the case that's the case they both have to come up here and rap you're\n\n01:03:21.780 --> 01:03:27.860\nlike my my Jiminy sobriety cricket like I can't halfway through the show I'm so\n\n01:03:27.860 --> 01:03:32.780\ndrunk that when Jeff throws me for a loop I don't even know how to articulate it\n\n01:03:32.780 --> 01:03:39.860\nfaster than you can I barely I'm just figuring out I was just fantasizing\n\n01:03:39.860 --> 01:03:42.860\nthat there would be a woman out of the crowd that wants to come up and freestyle\n\n01:03:42.860 --> 01:03:46.820\nrap that would be great don't get me wrong yeah it'd be as good as if a guy\n\n01:03:46.820 --> 01:03:51.820\nor anybody but I think it would be better but but all of it all of it might be bad\n\n01:03:51.820 --> 01:03:57.140\nwe don't know anyway anyways Brett Gelman what are you what are you excited\n\n01:03:57.140 --> 01:04:02.740\nabout working on right now yeah what's new eagle heart what when you're

01:04:38.420\nsolo you know you know but my girlfriend will but it's scripted\n\n01:04:38.420 --> 01:04:45.220\nhelping me write it what recording a mixtape or um I don't know what I think\n\n01:04:45.220 --> 01:04:51.620\nit'll be an EP and then hopefully and there'll be comedy on that you know on\n\n01:04:51.620 --> 01:04:55.340\nthere too you know and the songs probably will be

an it's an it's an\n\n01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:58.300\nexpression of my workaholism which is not has nothing to do with work ethic its\n\n01:07:58.300 --> 01:08:05.900\nrelationship with what I consider work and so it's like I yeah I'm like it's\n\n01:08:05.900 --> 01:08:11.620\nyeah my colleagues are suffering the symptom of me having an unhealthy\n\n01:08:11.620 --> 01:08:16.900\nrelationship with what I do it's not big it's not about competition or anything\n\n01:08:16.900 --> 01:08:22.180\nas much as I just like I'm like I have some aversion I want to get away from\n\n01:08:22.180 --> 01:08:26.420\nmy own work as soon as possible and then I like somehow categorize watching new\n\n01:08:26.420 --> 01:08:33.460\ngirl with my own job which I shouldn't have anything to do with that right new\n\n01:08:33.460 --> 01:08:39.260\ngirl he said as an example because I was like I should have bonded with it like\n\n01:08:39.260 --> 01:08:43.260\nyeah like Liz Merriweather and I like we had shows out at the same time and it\n\n01:08:43.260 --> 01:08:48.140\nwas like like shit like I was like why am I not watching your show and then like\n\n01:08:48.140 --> 01:08:52.580\nI would see a couple episodes because my ex-wife the gathie would be watching\n\n01:08:52.580 --> 01:08:56.740\nnew girl and I'd like I'd walk through the room and oh that's new girl yeah it's\n\n01:08:56.740 -->

get\n\n01:09:05.700 --> 01:09:11.180\nexcited why do I'm like I'm my fifth rewatch of my ninth season of forensic\n\n01:09:11.180 --> 01:09:15.580\nfiles like I'm just like like I just just like rape and murder and this is like\n\n01:09:15.580 --> 01:09:18.500\nlike give me the true crime and the fucking like I'm just like in this\n\n01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:22.700\ncrazy like right I'm a void it's avoidance it's avoidance of something\n\n01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:27.700\nyou think so I don't watch comedies like I have no desire to watch like\n\n01:09:27.700 --> 01:09:32.500\nsuccessful awesome like funny things I just they don't make me want to watch\n\n01:09:32.500 --> 01:09:37.260\nthem I'd rather watch this stupid shit more than I would watch people that my\n\n01:09:37.260 --> 01:09:42.100\nfriends like the shows my friends make right right and it's not out of I don't\n\n01:09:42.100 --> 01:09:46.580\nthink it's jealousy or like like like distancing myself in that it's like I\n\n01:09:46.580 --> 01:09:51.380\ndon't want to watch it well I think like maybe maybe it's and I can relate I do\n\n01:09:51.380 --> 01:09:55.620\nwatch things that my friends make but I sometimes don't feel like and there is\n\n01:09:55.620 --> 01:09:59.740\nlike an aversion I think it's just because it's all so close to you and\n\n01:09:59.740 --> 01:10:05.060\neven though this is our job we still relate to everybody that you want to\n\n01:10:05.060 --> 01:10:09.780\nwhen you watch something escape your life so this these things that are close\n\n01:10:09.780 --> 01:10:14.300\nto you by your friends are maybe making you guess not able to escape your life\n\n01:10:14.300 --> 01:10:17.420\nas much I guess I don't think it's something to do with engagement too\n\n01:10:17.420 --> 01:10:20.180\nthough because I don't think it's it's honestly not always like oh my friend\n\n01:10:20.180 --> 01:10:23.980\nworked on this or this is the same genre even it's like as we do with\n\n01:10:23.980 --> 01:10:30.140\nengagement uh-huh I think it's like like I I pay too much attention to act breaks\n\n01:10:30.140 --> 01:10:36.660\nor genre or something like that right where's in forensic files yeah like\n\n01:10:36.660 --> 01:10:42.100\nnonfiction and like horror like horror doesn't come anywhere near anything that\n\n01:10:42.100 --> 01:10:47.580\nI have ever done for a

it's not good\n\n01:20:19.260 --> 01:20:23.780\nwe're not gonna we need a really bad we need an A-list we need to rehearse this\n\n01:20:23.780 --> 01:20:29.740\nwe need to get a Brad Pitt involved to help us out here yeah Spencer you want\n\n01:20:29.740 --> 01:20:34.140\nto throw some George Clooney on that and we need an A-lister to make this\n\n01:20:34.140 --> 01:20:41.740\nstory work yeah that sounds good oh you meant an A-lister character not an A-lister\n\n01:20:41.740 --> 01:20:45.700\nperson doing the impression yeah that's oh geez what did you mean you're filled\n\n01:20:45.700 --> 01:20:49.220\nwith as much shame as me that's what I thought I meant you I don't think of\n\n01:20:49.220 --> 01:20:56.140\nmyself in terms of lists right right but my god for you for you to for you to\n\n01:20:56.140 --> 01:20:59.860\nhear that that's that amazes me because it's like that's that's a shame projection\n\n01:20:59.860 --> 01:21:03.060\nthat only I'm capable of where you you heard that as I was like yeah this guy's\n\n01:21:03.060 --> 01:21:08.540\nnot good enough at improv for us to mount this amazing goal oh I thought that\n\n01:21:08.540 --> 01:21:12.400\nyou just meant I wasn't famous enough to get away with doing a bad impression\n\n01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:16.220\nwhereas if Brad Pitt were up here and he was doing terrible Benicio impression\n\n01:21:16.220 --> 01:21:20.140\nI don't care it's so amazing you guys are doing fantastic impressions of kind of\n\n01:21:20.140 --> 01:21:24.940\nsecond banana care like character actors we needed like a like an A-lister I was\n\n01:21:24.940 --> 01:21:31.380\nsaying as the character oh my god I was turning to I was turning to Benicio\n\n01:21:31.380 --> 01:21:36.140\nwith well there we go again because I see Benicio and John is as A-listers but\n\n01:21:36.140 --> 01:21:39.260\nwell yeah but I guess they're not I think they both did and also so did the\n\n01:21:39.260 --> 01:21:43.740\nproducer that put them on set like how are they on set together and finding out\n\n01:21:43.740 --> 01:21:47.620\nthat they can't carry the movie that was my joke that they're both like this isn't\n\n01:21:47.620 --> 01:21:53.220\ngoing good is it I was blaming the fictional writer and producer of the\n\n01:21:53.220 --> 01:21:57.660\nmovie but we need someone else in here they themselves are such honest artists\n\n01:21:57.660 --> 01:22:01.380\nI think that they would be able to admit that it wasn't going well right they'd\n\n01:22:01.380 --> 01:22:06.140\nbe like either this needs to be an indie movie about going on a road trip right\n\n01:22:06.140 --> 01:22:13.220\nor I would watch or we need to step you know add some talent it sounds like it's\n\n01:22:13.220 --> 01:22:17.540\nJimmy Stewart yes Jimmy yes my child let's go sounds like Jimmy Stewart but\n\n01:22:17.540 --> 01:22:23.820\nthere is similarities yes there are similarities how about this how about\n\n01:22:23.820 -->

Benicio is the older but Benicio Dottaro plays the\n\n01:23:00.460 --> 01:23:06.740\nmanager and John Lefkir portrays Benicio Dottaro is playing shell shell\n\n01:23:06.740 -->

second?\n\n01:43:53.140 --> 01:43:54.700\nYeah, yeah, so hold on a second.\n\n01:43:54.700 --> 01:43:56.620\nI got to talk to my agent.\n\n01:43:56.620 --> 01:43:57.740\nExcuse us.\n\n01:43:57.740 --> 01:43:58.980\nSo we got to get the fuck out.\n\n01:43:58.980 --> 01:44:00.300\nWhat the fuck are we doing?\n\n01:44:00.300 --> 01:44:02.020\nThis is Goddamn Nazi Germany.\n\n01:44:02.020 --> 01:44:03.340\nWhat the fuck's going on?\n\n01:44:03.340 --> 01:44:06.820\nWell, you said you wanted to try out your new comedy routine\n\n01:44:06.820 --> 01:44:07.740\non a rough crowd.\n\n01:44:07.740 --> 01:44:09.660\nThe fuck actually, no, I didn't mean that.\n\n01:44:09.660 --> 01:44:12.780\nWell, as I was drunk, the most evil person who ever lived.\n\n01:44:12.780 --> 01:44:15.100\nYou're going to get me the hell out of here.\n\n01:44:15.100 --> 01:44:16.580\nOK, all right, I'll think of something.\n\n01:44:16.580 --> 01:44:20.180\nOh, gee whiz.\n\n01:44:20.180 --> 01:44:20.980\nHey, huh?\n\n01:44:20.980 --> 01:44:22.140\nSwastikas everywhere.\n\n01:44:22.140 --> 01:44:25.020\nEven the cake is shaped like a...\n\n01:44:25.020 --> 01:44:26.540\nJust, hey, be an actor.\n\n01:44:26.540 --> 01:44:27.940\nI don't even know where to cut it.\n\n01:44:27.940 --> 01:44:31.380\nI see you are enjoying my swastikas.\n\n01:44:31.380 --> 01:44:34.020\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:44:34.020 --> 01:44:34.740\nOh, we love them.\n\n01:44:34.740 --> 01:44:35.660\nWe love them.\n\n01:44:35.660 --> 01:44:36.420\nThey're wonderful.\n\n01:44:36.420 --> 01:44:41.220\nEven to eat them is to be complicit in the deliciousness\n\n01:44:41.220 --> 01:44:42.380\nof fascism.\n\n01:44:42.380 --> 01:44:43.260\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:44:43.260 --> 01:44:44.460\nBut they're very, very...\n\n01:44:44.460 --> 01:44:48.420\nActually, that symbol is used in some Native American iconography.\n\n01:44:48.420 --> 01:44:49.940\nOh, very good, very good.\n\n01:44:49.940 --> 01:44:53.420\nAnyway, no.\n\n01:44:53.420 --> 01:44:57.140\nSo we are not so very different to me and you, Jimmy Stewart.\n\n01:44:57.140 --> 01:44:57.900\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:44:57.900 --> 01:44:59.500\nAgain, we can all agree on something.\n\n01:44:59.500 --> 01:45:00.580\nAnyway, Chancellor.\n\n01:45:00.580 --> 01:45:05.500\nMr. Rubick, I have just got some information\n\n01:45:05.500 --> 01:45:08.500\nfrom my security team from the SD.\n\n01:45:08.500 --> 01:45:10.620\nI've gone through your 23andMe.\n\n01:45:10.620 --> 01:45:13.100\nIt turns out that your name is actually Superstite.\n\n01:45:18.580 --> 01:45:21.220\nTotally cool, totally cool.\n\n01:45:21.220 --> 01:45:25.580\nHe's referring to 1923andMe, which is unreliable.\n\n01:45:25.580 --> 01:45:29.020\nIt's conducted through a can with a string.\n\n01:45:29.020 --> 01:45:30.300\nYou can deny it.\n\n01:45:30.300 --> 01:45:34.540\nLook, Mr. Hitler, that report, it's not true.\n\n01:45:34.540 --> 01:45:35.700\nIt's not true.\n\n01:45:35.700 --> 01:45:38.340\nI had a whole thing with those people.\n\n01:45:38.340 --> 01:45:43.820\nI was going to make the biopic on the genesis of 1923andMe,\n\n01:45:43.820 --> 01:45:45.860\nbut it all fell through and they blamed me for it.\n\n01:45:45.860 --> 01:45:49.180\nAnd so they've been trying to spread around that I'm a Jew,\n\n01:45:49.180 --> 01:45:49.980\nbut I'm not a Jew.\n\n01:45:49.980 --> 01:45:51.540\nMy name is not Superstite.\n\n01:45:51.540 --> 01:45:53.020\nThey made all of that up.\n\n01:45:53.020 --> 01:46:01.500\nMy name is Gribbles Rubick, and I don't like anything\n\n01:46:01.500 --> 01:46:03.980\nthat's not white, white, white.\n\n01:46:03.980 --> 01:46:06.580\nWhite and more white, OK?\n\n01:46:06.580 --> 01:46:08.020\nAll white is all right.\n\n01:46:08.020 --> 01:46:08.620\nAll white is all right.\n\n01:46:08.620 --> 01:46:09.500\nThat's what I'm always saying.\n\n01:46:09.500 --> 01:46:10.020\nAnyway.\n\n01:46:10.020 --> 01:46:10.780\nWe should get going.\n\n01:46:10.780 --> 01:46:12.020\nYeah, we got to go.\n\n01:46:12.020 --> 01:46:13.060\nWe got an Uber.\n\n01:46:13.060 --> 01:46:14.260\nWe bought an Uber.\n\n01:46:14.260 --> 01:46:14.820\nYeah, we bought an Uber.\n\n01:46:14.820 --> 01:46:16.220\nWas that your idea?\n\n01:46:16.220 --> 01:46:16.740\nUber.\n\n01:46:16.740 --> 01:46:17.780\nUber.\n\n01:46:17.780 --> 01:46:20.060\nWhich was there were every person\n\n01:46:20.060 --> 01:46:22.860\nwho was named Uber in Germany at this time.\n\n01:46:22.860 --> 01:46:24.660\nThey drove taxis.\n\n01:46:24.660 --> 01:46:26.660\nWe've got an Uber good time here.\n\n01:46:26.660 --> 01:46:27.980\nIt's a special kind of taxi.\n\n01:46:27.980 --> 01:46:30.220\nPersonally, I don't like the Ubers.\n\n01:46:30.220 --> 01:46:35.020\nI prefer the Lyftwaffe.\n\n01:46:35.020 --> 01:46:37.580\nJesus.\n\n01:46:37.580 --> 01:46:39.900\nWe're just into a weird variety show sketch.\n\n01:46:39.900 --> 01:46:46.100\nWe're making an America fall in love with Hitler.\n\n01:46:46.100 --> 01:46:47.780\nHe's just a goofy character.\n\n01:46:47.780 --> 01:46:51.540\n23 of me and Uber and Lyft.\n\n01:46:51.540 --> 01:46:54.340\nIt's like the Benny Hill show.\n\n01:46:54.340 --> 01:46:56.620\nAll right, well, we're going to get out of here.\n\n01:46:56.620 --> 01:46:59.740\nIt's important that we get out of here.\n\n01:46:59.740 --> 01:47:02.300\nWe got to do back in America.\n\n01:47:02.300 --> 01:47:05.020\nIt's how everybody proud boys meeting.\n\n01:47:08.620 --> 01:47:10.820\nWe're very proud of us that we met you.\n\n01:47:10.820 --> 01:47:11.620\nProud of everything.\n\n01:47:11.620 --> 01:47:13.620\nProud to meet you.\n\n01:47:13.620 --> 01:47:15.940\nYou're going to hang out with the proud boys?\n\n01:47:15.940 --> 01:47:17.860\nOh, we love everything.\n\n01:47:17.860 --> 01:47:19.660\nYou know what we call them here in Germany?\n\n01:47:19.660 --> 01:47:22.140\nRegular boys.\n\n01:47:22.140 --> 01:47:26.220\nWe call them Deutschbags.\n\n01:47:26.220 --> 01:47:31.100\nHitler, you've got to stop franchising you.\n\n01:47:31.100 --> 01:47:34.020\nI'm trying to have a good time.\n\n01:47:34.020 --> 01:47:38.420\nWe're on the risk of making you magwai from the gremlins.\n\n01:47:38.420 --> 01:47:41.300\nWe're not into gizmo.\n\n01:47:41.300 --> 01:47:42.860\nWe don't want people to start to wear\n\n01:47:42.860 --> 01:47:45.100\nharbored-down t-shirts that have Hitler on them,\n\n01:47:45.100 --> 01:47:51.100\nsmiling, and he's got to catch phrases that are fun to repeat.\n\n01:47:51.100 --> 01:47:54.860\nIt may be how this started in real Germany.\n\n01:47:54.860 --> 01:47:58.660\nIt probably started making fun of his hair and his mustache.\n\n01:47:58.660 --> 01:48:00.420\nI didn't even invite you.\n\n01:48:00.420 --> 01:48:02.020\nYou guys just came to my home.\n\n01:48:02.020 --> 01:48:05.700\nI thought, jeez, we got to get out of here.\n\n01:48:05.700 --> 01:48:06.540\nLet's get out.\n\n01:48:06.540 --> 01:48:08.340\nYou couldn't have left any time we wanted.\n\n01:48:08.340 --> 01:48:10.260\nWe're taking the first zeppelin out of here.\n\n01:48:10.260 --> 01:48:11.100\nWe don't want to be rude.\n\n01:48:11.100 --> 01:48:11.940\nWe don't want to be rude.\n\n01:48:11.940 --> 01:48:15.060\nWe wanted to show you your due respect and whatnot.\n\n01:48:15.060 --> 01:48:15.500\nCome on.\n\n01:48:15.500 --> 01:48:17.460\nI booked us on the Hindenburg.\n\n01:48:17.460 --> 01:48:18.020\nLet's get out of here.\n\n01:48:18.020 --> 01:48:19.260\nOh, yeah, let's go.\n\n01:48:19.260 --> 01:48:19.940\nHindenburg.\n\n01:48:19.940 --> 01:48:25.740\nThat's too soon.\n\n01:48:25.740 --> 01:48:28.420\nOh, I got your first class tickets.\n\n01:48:28.420 --> 01:48:29.020\nHere you go.\n\n01:48:29.020 --> 01:48:29.940\nOh, thank you.\n\n01:48:29.940 --> 01:48:31.820\nYou don't have to buy me these tickets.\n\n01:48:31.820 --> 01:48:32.740\nIt's very nice of you.\n\n01:48:32.740 --> 01:48:34.380\nYou've been a great agent.\n\n01:48:34.380 --> 01:48:36.860\nI'm tired of this 10% nonsense.\n\n01:48:36.860 --> 01:48:37.860\nI owe you my life.\n\n01:48:37.860 --> 01:48:39.660\nI was with washing dishes.\n\n01:48:39.660 --> 01:48:41.340\nNow, granted, we took a bit of a detour.\n\n01:48:41.340 --> 01:48:43.460\nI don't want to end up in Nazi Germany.\n\n01:48:43.460 --> 01:48:45.100\nOf course, and I really don't.\n\n01:48:45.100 --> 01:48:48.580\nBut even here, aboard the Hindenburg, at least\n\n01:48:48.580 --> 01:48:50.300\nI'm not washing dishes.\n\n01:48:50.300 --> 01:48:53.540\nSure, as we go down in flames, yeah, we somehow survive.\n\n01:48:53.540 --> 01:48:57.220\nHey, come on, let's get this cock-sucking blimp moving.\n\n01:48:57.220 --> 01:48:58.740\nI don't care what it's filled with.\n\n01:48:58.740 --> 01:49:00.980\nFill it with something lighter than air.\n\n01:49:00.980 --> 01:49:02.180\nI don't care what.\n\n01:49:02.180 --> 01:49:05.260\nJust fill it with the first inert gas.\n\n01:49:05.260 --> 01:49:09.900\nWell, then fill it with a non-inert gas.\n\n01:49:09.900 --> 01:49:11.980\nJust fill it with a gas.\n\n01:49:11.980 --> 01:49:14.900\nThe first one you find on the periodic table.\n\n01:49:14.900 --> 01:49:19.220\nOh, for God's sakes, these fucking crouts.\n\n01:49:19.220 --> 01:49:20.300\nHey, you have a cigarette?\n\n01:49:23.580 --> 01:49:25.340\nYeah, sure, here you go.\n\n01:49:25.340 --> 01:49:28.140\nListen, you crouts, if you don't get this cock-sucking blimp\n\n01:49:28.140 --> 01:49:30.620\nmoving, what?\n\n01:49:30.620 --> 01:49:31.180\nStop it.\n\n01:49:31.180 --> 01:49:33.340\nI'm sick of these Nazi pieces of shit.\n\n01:49:33.340 --> 01:49:35.620\nFill your blimp with a gas.\n\n01:49:35.620 --> 01:49:38.900\nThe first one you find on the periodic table.\n\n01:49:38.900 --> 01:49:40.700\nI don't care how many electrons it needs.\n\n01:49:40.700 --> 01:49:42.700\nJimmy, you're phrasing cock-sucking is negative.\n\n01:49:42.700 --> 01:49:44.380\nThat's the first mistake there.\n\n01:49:44.380 --> 01:49:46.500\nSuperstine, how do you think I got where I am?\n\n01:49:46.500 --> 01:49:47.380\nSuck and cock.\n\n01:49:50.380 --> 01:49:51.140\nI'll tell you this.\n\n01:49:51.140 --> 01:49:54.300\nEven more the reason you shouldn't use it in a negative way.\n\n01:49:54.300 --> 01:49:55.220\nIt's a positive thing.\n\n01:49:55.220 --> 01:49:56.580\nIt'll help you get to where your career is today.\n\n01:49:56.580 --> 01:49:59.300\nYou show me a society where you can admit suck and cock,\n\n01:49:59.300 --> 01:50:00.500\nand I'll be all out in the open.\n\n01:50:00.500 --> 01:50:02.900\nUntil then, I've got to say, all aboard.\n\n01:50:10.340 --> 01:50:12.340\nThis is Mr. Gefford.\n\n01:50:12.340 --> 01:50:14.340\nI am a famous radio historian.\n\n01:50:14.340 --> 01:50:17.620\nI am here at the Lodger for the Hindenburg, and I'm watching.\n\n01:50:17.620 --> 01:50:18.300\nJimmy, wake up.\n\n01:50:18.300 --> 01:50:18.900\nWake up, Jimmy.\n\n01:50:18.900 --> 01:50:19.540\nWake up.\n\n01:50:19.540 --> 01:50:20.860\nWake up.\n\n01:50:20.860 --> 01:50:22.060\nWake up, Jimmy.\n\n01:50:22.060 --> 01:50:23.420\nWake up.\n\n01:50:23.420 --> 01:50:24.740\nJimmy.\n\n01:50:24.740 --> 01:50:26.420\nJimmy.\n\n01:50:26.420 --> 01:50:28.540\nOh, God.\n\n01:50:28.540 --> 01:50:29.060\nJimmy.\n\n01:50:29.060 --> 01:50:31.380\nMichelle, I had a horrible dream.\n\n01:50:31.380 --> 01:50:33.580\nI dreamt I wasn't a star at all.\n\n01:50:33.580 --> 01:50:35.020\nI was a Nazi.\n\n01:50:35.020 --> 01:50:39.220\nYou were there, and the Hindenburg was there.\n\n01:50:39.220 --> 01:50:40.580\nI'm sorry I didn't wake you sooner.\n\n01:50:40.580 --> 01:50:43.060\nIt's just you had a massive hard-on.\n\n01:50:43.060 --> 01:50:45.380\nSo I thought if we were having a pleasurable dream,\n\n01:50:45.380 --> 01:50:47.420\nI didn't think it was a nightmare.\n\n01:50:47.420 --> 01:50:50.620\nAnyway, I'm sorry.\n\n01:50:50.620 --> 01:50:52.180\nYeah, so it was bad.\n\n01:50:52.180 --> 01:50:53.580\nIt was bad, the dream.\n\n01:50:53.580 --> 01:50:54.540\nYeah, I mean.\n\n01:50:54.540 --> 01:50:55.540\nBut I was there.\n\n01:50:55.540 --> 01:50:55.940\nYeah, you were there.\n\n01:50:55.940 --> 01:50:56.820\nI was there in your dream.\n\n01:50:56.820 --> 01:50:57.860\nYou were there.\n\n01:50:57.860 --> 01:50:58.940\nI'm that important to you.\n\n01:50:58.940 --> 01:51:00.500\nAlso, I was there.\n\n01:51:00.500 --> 01:51:00.980\nOh.\n\n01:51:03.860 --> 01:51:07.820\nWell, why do you think I'd invite you on this camping trip?\n\n01:51:07.820 --> 01:51:09.980\nWhy do you think we're all the same tent together?\n\n01:51:09.980 --> 01:51:11.980\nOf course, you're all important to me.\n\n01:51:11.980 --> 01:51:14.860\nMichelle, Adolf.\n\n01:51:14.860 --> 01:51:15.340\nRight.\n\n01:51:15.340 --> 01:51:16.860\nLet's get on this fucking cart on.\n\n01:51:16.860 --> 01:51:18.580\nIt's Goebbels.\n\n01:51:18.580 --> 01:51:19.500\nIt's Goebbels.\n\n01:51:19.500 --> 01:51:20.660\nOh, you're Goebbels.\n\n01:51:20.660 --> 01:51:22.820\nOh, sorry, sorry, yeah.\n\n01:51:22.820 --> 01:51:26.060\nIt's kind of damn it.\n\n01:51:26.060 --> 01:51:29.460\nI'm going to go get us some firewood.\n\n01:51:29.460 --> 01:51:32.100\nAll right, well, Adolf, look.\n\n01:51:32.100 --> 01:51:33.380\nYou know, he's going to get us firewood.\n\n01:51:33.380 --> 01:51:35.860\nI got to live with you here.\n\n01:51:35.860 --> 01:51:40.820\nI hope there's not going to be any alcohol in this party,\n\n01:51:40.820 --> 01:51:42.220\nas I'm tea totaled.\n\n01:51:42.220 --> 01:51:45.220\nI don't drink.\n\n01:51:45.220 --> 01:51:46.620\nNo, there won't be.\n\n01:51:46.620 --> 01:51:47.060\nThere won't be.\n\n01:51:47.060 --> 01:51:48.700\nJust don't drink anything, though.\n\n01:51:48.700 --> 01:51:50.300\nDid you know why I don't drink alcohol?\n\n01:51:50.300 --> 01:51:52.860\nWhy?\n\n01:51:52.860 --> 01:51:55.660\nBecause I am an angry drunk.\n\n01:51:55.660 --> 01:51:57.580\nYou're an angry drunk?\n\n01:51:57.580 --> 01:52:01.420\nAnd when you're sober, you're not angry.\n\n01:52:01.420 --> 01:52:02.740\nNo anger, Wayne.\n\n01:52:02.740 --> 01:52:04.740\nThese days, or any day recently,\n\n01:52:04.740 --> 01:52:06.500\nI'm feeling quite relaxed.\n\n01:52:06.500 --> 01:52:09.340\nIs that Jimmy Stewart chopping wood over there?\n\n01:52:09.340 --> 01:52:09.780\nYeah, no.\n\n01:52:09.780 --> 01:52:13.060\nHe just said he went over to chop wood.\n\n01:52:13.060 --> 01:52:16.220\nI got three logs.\n\n01:52:16.220 --> 01:52:18.740\nI chopped out a tree and cut it into three logs.\n\n01:52:18.740 --> 01:52:20.660\nI used space work.\n\n01:52:20.660 --> 01:52:24.780\nBut you'd have to subscribe to the podcast to know that.\n\n01:52:24.780 --> 01:52:25.260\nAnyway.\n\n01:52:25.260 --> 01:52:28.500\nThere it is, a backpack with three logs in it.\n\n01:52:28.500 --> 01:52:31.020\nDoes that show you get a Susanite?\n\n01:52:31.020 --> 01:52:33.780\nSay what?\n\n01:52:33.780 --> 01:52:36.860\nI said, that should get us Susanite.\n\n01:52:36.860 --> 01:52:37.500\nOh, nice.\n\n01:52:37.500 --> 01:52:40.940\nSusanite?\n\n01:52:40.940 --> 01:52:42.940\nWho's Susanite?\n\n01:52:42.940 --> 01:52:43.420\nWhat?\n\n01:52:43.420 --> 01:52:45.140\nShould I represent her?\n\n01:52:45.140 --> 01:52:45.860\nSusanite.\n\n01:52:45.860 --> 01:52:48.300\nI said, that should get us through the night.\n\n01:52:48.300 --> 01:52:50.340\nOh, through the night.\n\n01:52:50.340 --> 01:52:54.060\nI thought you said that should get us Susanite.\n\n01:52:54.060 --> 01:52:56.300\nOn my heads in the biz, I'm always thinking of deals.\n\n01:52:56.300 --> 01:52:58.020\nI thought for a second that maybe you guys\n\n01:52:58.020 --> 01:53:01.700\nwere talking about some movie collaboration together.\n\n01:53:01.700 --> 01:53:03.460\nWell, I'm going to take one of these logs\n\n01:53:03.460 --> 01:53:06.060\nand rub it on the other two and make some fire.\n\n01:53:06.060 --> 01:53:08.700\nRight, a real man, a real American here.\n\n01:53:08.700 --> 01:53:10.940\nOr I'm sure you can do it too.\n\n01:53:10.940 --> 01:53:16.500\nBoy, this is harder than they make it look in the pictures.\n\n01:53:16.500 --> 01:53:17.660\nOh, you've never done it before?\n\n01:53:17.660 --> 01:53:19.540\nNo, I'm not doing it now.\n\n01:53:19.540 --> 01:53:21.060\nIt's not working.\n\n01:53:21.060 --> 01:53:23.020\nI have to say, this is very good space work\n\n01:53:23.020 --> 01:53:24.060\nyou're doing, officer.\n\n01:53:24.060 --> 01:53:27.220\nOh, thanks, Hitler.\n\n01:53:27.220 --> 01:53:28.540\nWhy am I here?\n\n01:53:28.540 --> 01:53:30.860\nWhy am I here?\n\n01:53:30.860 --> 01:53:31.580\nWhy am I here?\n\n01:53:31.580 --> 01:53:36.860\nHey, no, we need you here, Superstine.\n\n01:53:36.860 --> 01:53:38.500\nRubik.\n\n01:53:38.500 --> 01:53:39.740\nLook, we all know who you are.\n\n01:53:39.740 --> 01:53:41.980\nFine, fine, fine.\n\n01:53:41.980 --> 01:53:44.020\nIf you're all right with it, I'm all right with it.\n\n01:53:44.020 --> 01:53:45.700\nDo you want to know my real name?\n\n01:53:45.700 --> 01:53:47.020\nWhat's your real name?\n\n01:53:47.020 --> 01:53:49.700\nHitler.\n\n01:53:49.700 --> 01:53:52.100\nSo we can all be friends here in this tent.\n\n01:53:52.100 --> 01:53:53.540\nWe can all camp together.\n\n01:53:53.540 --> 01:53:54.740\nWe can all have a good time.\n\n01:53:54.740 --> 01:53:56.580\nIt's just an agent from Hollywood\n\n01:53:56.580 --> 01:54:01.100\nand a famous to-be actor and the potential dictator\n\n01:54:01.100 --> 01:54:03.740\nof Nazi Europe.\n\n01:54:03.740 --> 01:54:04.540\nWe can all just have a good time.\n\n01:54:04.540 --> 01:54:06.740\nOh, this is why you're still chancellor.\n\n01:54:06.740 --> 01:54:07.900\nThis is why you're still chancellor.\n\n01:54:07.900 --> 01:54:10.100\nOh, gosh, oh, gosh.\n\n01:54:10.100 --> 01:54:11.100\nUh-oh.\n\n01:54:11.100 --> 01:54:11.540\nOh, no.\n\n01:54:11.540 --> 01:54:12.020\nOh, my God.\n\n01:54:12.020 --> 01:54:12.620\nOh, no, it's here.\n\n01:54:12.620 --> 01:54:13.140\nOh, the fire.\n\n01:54:13.140 --> 01:54:13.940\nWhat is happening?\n\n01:54:13.940 --> 01:54:15.020\nThe fire's too big.\n\n01:54:15.020 --> 01:54:16.500\nThe fire's too big.\n\n01:54:16.500 --> 01:54:17.380\nOh, my God.\n\n01:54:17.380 --> 01:54:18.260\nHow do we put the fire out?\n\n01:54:18.260 --> 01:54:18.740\nLighter fluid inside the tent.\n\n01:54:18.740 --> 01:54:22.220\nOh, God, I hate to do this, but here, throw these books.\n\n01:54:22.220 --> 01:54:23.220\nDon't get any ideas.\n\n01:54:23.220 --> 01:54:25.580\nThrow all the books out the fire.\n\n01:54:25.580 --> 01:54:27.940\nBooks will put out the fire.\n\n01:54:27.940 --> 01:54:30.020\nWhy would you throw books on the fire\n\n01:54:30.020 --> 01:54:31.860\nto put a fire out?\n\n01:54:31.860 --> 01:54:34.500\nBecause they're really boring books.\n\n01:54:34.500 --> 01:54:39.140\nAnd I thought it would lure the fire to sleep.\n\n01:54:39.140 --> 01:54:40.700\nOh, God.\n\n01:54:40.700 --> 01:54:41.180\nI think you.\n\n01:54:41.180 --> 01:54:42.100\nShell, wake up.\n\n01:54:42.100 --> 01:54:42.580\nShell.\n\n01:54:42.580 --> 01:54:45.420\nOh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
