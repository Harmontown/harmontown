this guy's thinking too much.\n\n10:13.780 --> 10:17.820\nBut he cooled off, and then he shook someone else's hand,\n\n10:17.820 --> 10:20.820\nand then he wandered off.\n\n10:20.820 --> 10:25.780\nFirst of all, that sounds like, he sounds like that smart bot\n\n10:25.780 --> 10:28.820\nonline, you know, like the one where you're child.\n\n10:28.820 --> 10:31.860\nThe one where it's just based on previous people's entries.\n\n10:31.860 --> 10:34.620\nSo even though it's really cool what it says to you,\n\n10:34.620 --> 10:37.340\nthe conversation doesn't, it only lasts a couple of minutes.\n\n10:37.340 --> 10:39.220\nSo you go like, hey, how are you?\n\n10:39.220 --> 10:40.500\nAnd it says something amazing.\n\n10:40.500 --> 10:42.860\nLike, hey, what do you think of John Travolta?\n\n10:42.860 --> 10:44.900\nAnd you're like, whoa, you like John Travolta?\n\n10:44.900 --> 10:46.060\nAnd he's like, what do you like?\n\n10:46.060 --> 10:48.180\nYeah, that's, that's what

talk to my roommate.\n\n10:54.580 --> 10:56.620\nWhen I'm talking to him, it feels like that.\n\n10:56.620 --> 10:58.660\nBecause I'm just like, hey, how's it going?\n\n10:58.660 --> 11:00.020\nAnd he's like, how you doing?\n\n11:00.020 --> 11:01.500\nAnd I'm like, I'm doing good.\n\n11:01.500 --> 11:03.620\nAnd he's like, doing good is good.\n\n11:03.620 --> 11:04.980\nAnd I'm like, what?\n\n11:04.980 --> 11:06.580\nAnd he's like, doing my what?\n\n11:06.580 --> 11:09.700\nAnd I'm like, Jesus, this is not a conversation.\n\n11:09.700 --> 11:12.180\nAnd he's like, conversations are doing my what?\n\n11:12.180 --> 11:14.700\nAnd then he just wanders out.\n\n11:14.700 --> 11:16.980\nI'm like, this guy's a robot.\n\n11:16.980 --> 11:19.300\nRemember when we were at that bar in Culver City\n\n11:19.300 --> 11:22.220\nand those guys came in?\n\n11:22.220 --> 11:23.660\nOh my god.\n\n11:23.660 --> 11:24.860\nAnd they were trying to like.\n\n11:24.860 --> 11:28.020\nNow that was racial motivated fear.\n\n11:28.020 --> 11:31.020\nWell, it was because it was like an all, it was like,\n\n11:31.020 --> 11:34.900\nyeah, because they were, it was a, what is the, what is it?\n\n11:34.900 --> 11:38.100\nIt was this old, old white guy's bar.\n\n11:38.100 --> 11:40.380\nThere's, there's just old, old dudes hanging out.\n\n11:40.380 --> 11:43.780\nAnd then we wandered in and then these Mexican guys showed up\n\n11:43.780 --> 11:47.660\nand they were really fucking high, which isn't a problem,\n\n11:47.660 --> 11:49.700\nbut they seemed to carry on as if,\n\n11:49.700 --> 11:52.300\nif people knew they were high, they'd get arrested.\n\n11:52.300 --> 11:53.140\nRight.\n\n11:53.140 --> 11:56.620\nSo it created a lot of tension right off the bat.\n\n11:56.620 --> 11:59.340\nAnd it was not dialed down from that point on.\n\n11:59.340 --> 12:01.420\nAnd it felt like the, it felt like the bigger guy was like\n\n12:01.420 --> 12:03.340\nthe littler guy's uncle or something.\n\n12:03.340 --> 12:04.940\nIt didn't feel like they were hanging out as friends.\n\n12:04.940 --> 12:08.060\nIt was almost like, like this is the equivalent of,\n\n12:08.060 --> 12:10.300\nof in the Midwest of being dragged into the woods\n\n12:10.300 --> 12:11.540\nto go deer hunting.\n\n12:11.540 --> 12:12.900\nAnd he's just like, come on,\n\n12:12.900 --> 12:14.780\nI'm going to take you into this white people's bar\n\n12:14.780 --> 12:17.140\nand we're going to, we're going to get yelled at.\n\n12:17.140 --> 12:22.140\nAnd then you'll be a man because he really wanted like,\n\n12:22.500 --> 12:25.420\nhe wanted to get yelled at, but, but everybody was like,\n\n12:25.420 --> 12:27.380\nlike, okay, it's like, like, yeah.\n\n12:27.380 --> 12:30.940\nSo the younger guy, he was really like drunk and high,\n\n12:30.940 --> 12:33.300\nbut he was having a great time and he just wanted to talk\n\n12:33.300 --> 12:35.420\nabout football and he was in a great mood\n\n12:35.420 --> 12:36.860\nand everyone was loving it.\n\n12:36.860 --> 12:39.260\nBut we were loving it too much for the older guy.\n\n12:39.260 --> 12:41.740\nCause he thought that we were making fun of the little guy,\n\n12:41.740 --> 12:43.500\nbut we were just, he was great, you know,\n\n12:43.500 --> 12:44.340\nhe was having fun.\n\n12:44.340 --> 12:45.180\nWe were just yes standing him.\n\n12:45.180 --> 12:47.380\nHe wanted to talk about like moon boots or whatever came up.\n\n12:47.380 --> 12:48.220\nYeah.\n\n12:48.220 --> 12:49.100\nAnd we're like, oh, what about moon boots?\n\n12:49.100 --> 12:49.920\nYou remember moon boots?\n\n12:49.920 --> 12:51.460\nHe's like, come on, come on, man, he's drunk.\n\n12:51.460 --> 12:52.900\nBut then the weird thing is,\n\n12:52.900 --> 12:55.220\nthen he turned to the kid and go, shut the fuck up.\n\n12:55.220 --> 12:56.060\nWhat did I fucking tell you?\n\n12:56.060 --> 12:56.900\nShut the fuck up.\n\n12:56.900 --> 12:57.740\nFucking embarrassing.\n\n12:57.740 --> 12:58.580\nShut the fuck up.\n\n12:58.580 --> 12:59.420\nShut the fuck up.\n\n12:59.420 --> 13:00.260\nYou shut up.\n\n13:00.260 -->

burst.\n\n13:05.820 --> 13:06.660\nAnd he would go full burst.\n\n13:06.660 --> 13:08.180\nAnd it happened like 20 times.\n\n13:08.180 --> 13:09.020\nBut all the time.\n\n13:09.020 --> 13:11.100\nAnd the craziest part of it was that the only,\n\n13:11.100 --> 13:13.860\nhe kept, no matter what topic came up,\n\n13:13.860 --> 13:15.140\nlike, like, like, like,\n\n13:15.140 --> 13:17.420\nhe didn't get the like conflict he wanted.\n\n13:17.420 --> 13:19.540\nSo it would be like, I'd put my glass down\n\n13:19.540 --> 13:21.580\non top of my laptop on the bar and he'd go like,\n\n13:21.580 -->

like, okay, he cares about my laptop.\n\n13:37.140 --> 13:37.980\nThat's a good start.\n\n13:37.980 --> 13:40.540\nAnd he's like, hey, man, you don't like night bowling?\n\n13:40.540 --> 13:42.740\nYeah, so I was like, should we talk about bowling?\n\n13:42.740 --> 13:43.740\nWe're like, we're like, Todd,\n\n13:43.740 --> 13:46.060\nhe's trying to pick fights about bowling.\n\n13:46.060 --> 13:47.980\nAnd then, but then we're not going to fight him.\n\n13:47.980 --> 13:48.900\nSo we're just like, like, like,\n\n13:48.900 --> 13:50.100\nwe're just talking, we're just agreeing\n\n13:50.100 --> 13:50.940\nwith him about bowling.\n\n13:50.940 --> 13:51.980\nAnd we're like, yeah, there used to be a lot\n\n13:51.980 --> 13:53.140\nof good bowling alleys around here.\n\n13:53.140 --> 13:54.980\nAnd he's like, yeah, then what happened?\n\n13:54.980 --> 13:59.980\nAnd McKenna goes, McKenna goes like, well, you know,\n\n14:00.460 --> 14:01.940\nlike they were real bowling alleys.\n\n14:01.940 --> 14:03.300\nAnd now it's all that night bowling shit.\n\n14:03.300 --> 14:05.420\nAnd he's like, night bowling shit?\n\n14:07.060 --> 14:09.740\nAnd McKenna's like, yeah, you know, like,\n\n14:09.740 --> 14:12.540\nlike everything's glow in the dark\n\n14:12.540 --> 14:14.460\nand there's like ecstasy music playing.\n\n14:14.460 --> 14:15.300\nAnd they're doing that.\n\n14:15.300 --> 14:17.140\nThey're like three in the afternoon.\n\n14:17.140 --> 14:19.220\nAnd he's like, oh, it's like, and I was like,\n\n14:19.220 --> 14:20.900\nand then it's, you know, move on and go like,\n\n14:20.900 --> 14:21.740\nhey, what is this?\n\n14:21.740 --> 14:23.020\nWhat does somebody think of this napkin or something?\n\n14:23.020 --> 14:25.620\nBut the guy kept focusing on McKenna and he's like,\n\n14:25.620 --> 14:27.740\nso you don't like night bowling, huh?\n\n14:27.740 --> 14:29.860\nIt's like, yeah, something like that.\n\n14:29.860 --> 14:33.980\nWhat are the, what are you, you are the,\n\n14:33.980 --> 14:37.100\nif the idea is that this is threatening,\n\n14:37.100 --> 14:39.740\nyour gang is the worst.\n\n14:39.740 --> 14:41.860\nAnd then the other guy would be all like, yeah, man,\n\n14:41.860 --> 14:43.620\nnight bowling, it's like the balls are green.\n\n14:43.620 --> 14:45.060\nHe's like, shut the fuck up, shut up.\n\n14:45.060 --> 14:47.260\nShut the fuck up, shut the fuck up, shut the fuck up.\n\n14:47.260 --> 14:48.580\nYou shut the fuck up, you shut the fuck up.\n\n14:48.580 --> 14:50.420\nYou shut the conversation.\n\n14:50.420 --> 14:52.180\nI'm not, that's not an exaggeration.\n\n14:52.180 --> 14:56.540\nIt was like the craziest like ventriloquist act turned,\n\n14:56.540 --> 14:59.900\nlike some fucking weirdest shit.\n\n15:01.820 --> 15:04.260\nAll right, yeah, I mean, there's nothing more to say about it.\n\n15:04.260 --> 15:07.300\nThat was the whole incident, basically, yeah.\n\n15:07.300 --> 15:11.500\nAnd it's really hard to tell that story as funny as it is\n\n15:11.500 --> 15:13.620\nbecause we live in sensitive times and you don't want,\n\n15:13.620 --> 15:15.940\nyou don't want old, old white fat Dan Harmon\n\n15:15.940 --> 15:18.900\ndoing a fucking awesome Mexican accent and doing his impression\n\n15:18.900 --> 15:22.540\nof this guy is like, like, you know, as Donald Trump says,\n\n15:22.540 --> 15:25.540\nlots of them are wonderful people.\n\n15:27.220 --> 15:29.420\nAnd so many of them are probably listeners\n\n15:29.420 --> 15:31.260\nand I don't want them to hear me doing like\n\n15:31.260 --> 15:34.420\nsome kind of fucking Jose Jimenez or whatever the, you know.\n\n15:34.420 --> 15:37.420\nIt was, shut the fuck up, shut the fuck up, shut the fuck up.\n\n15:37.420 --> 15:39.540\nHe was that archetype and he had that accent\n\n15:39.540 --> 15:41.100\nand he was like cut that silhouette\n\n15:41.100 --> 15:45.260\nand was like trying to like chest up about night bowling\n\n15:45.260 --> 15:50.260\nwith Chris McKenna at three in the afternoon in Culver City\n\n15:52.540 --> 15:53.940\nnext to a shuffleboard.\n\n15:53.940 --> 15:55.380\nMcKenna's a big dude.\n\n15:56.940 --> 15:59.780\nOh, they eventually they got the, they just like,\n\n15:59.780 --> 16:01.700\nI can't remember what the final topic was, but it was like,\n\n16:01.700 --> 16:04.700\nit was probably like McKenna didn't like Smurfs or something.\n\n16:04.700 --> 16:07.220\nIt was, yeah, it was like, well, what's that supposed to mean?\n\n16:07.220 --> 16:08.860\nAnd McKenna's like, okay, come on.\n\n16:08.860 --> 16:09.900\nLike, that's enough.\n\n16:09.900 --> 16:11.660\nAnd then the bartender said, okay, guys get out of here.\n\n16:11.660 --> 16:13.300\nAnd then they just, they just did, they just like,\n\n16:13.300 --> 16:15.420\nyeah, they were nice about it.\n\n16:15.420 --> 16:16.980\nYou don't like day drinking?\n\n16:16.980 --> 16:22.380\nYeah, I mean, I wish, I wish you could like,\n\n16:22.380 --> 16:24.700\nlike bring those guys in through a pneumatic tube\n\n16:24.700 --> 16:27.140\nand just like ask them questions like the,\n\n16:27.140 --> 16:30.980\nlike the aliens in ID for you or something like,\n\n16:30.980 --> 16:33.980\nlike just have a dialogue without there being any kind of\n\n16:33.980 --> 16:36.620\nresentment or anything, but just, just like,\n\n16:36.620 --> 16:39.180\nwhat, what, what do you want from us?\n\n16:39.180 --> 16:42.900\nYou could fight, why, why about night bowling?\n\n16:42.900 --> 16:45.180\nThere's so many things to fight about.\n\n16:45.180 --> 16:46.900\nI'll fight about anything.\n\n16:47.900 --> 16:49.380\nI was drunk.\n\n16:49.380 --> 16:50.220\nI don't know.\n\n16:50.220 --> 16:52.340\nYou can feel, it was weird because you could feel like\n\n16:52.340 --> 16:55.620\nthe socioeconomic like power structures at play\n\n16:55.620 --> 16:58.220\nand everyone was trying to like avoid around them\n\n16:58.220 --> 16:59.860\nand not get into like, you know,\n\n16:59.860 --> 17:02.500\neveryone was trying to tiptoe around everybody else,\n\n17:02.500 --> 17:05.740\nbut that got everyone so stressed out that it came to a head.\n\n17:05.740 --> 17:07.180\nBut you could like see it happening.\n\n17:07.180 --> 17:08.820\nIt was just a bunch of car wrecks\n\n17:08.820 --> 17:10.820\nas people were trying to accommodate the other\n\n17:10.820 --> 17:12.700\nand then just not doing a great job of it.\n\n17:12.700 --> 17:17.620\nYeah, it's like the, the, the 50s or 60s like scenario is\n\n17:17.620 --> 17:22.620\ntotally unassuming minority person walks into a\n\n17:24.100 --> 17:28.740\nunfree white establishment and, and much to their shock,\n\n17:28.740 --> 17:32.260\nthe white people are, are, are following some code\n\n17:32.260 --> 17:34.020\nthat they now are finding out existed\n\n17:34.020 --> 17:35.460\nand it's very traumatic for them.\n\n17:35.460 --> 17:36.860\nAnd it's no better now.\n\n17:36.860 --> 17:38.940\nNow it's just as bad, except it's just like,\n\n17:38.940 --> 17:42.180\nit's all kind of like, it's like one person walking in\n\n17:42.180 --> 17:43.780\nand going, well, this is going to be bad.\n\n17:43.780 --> 17:45.460\nAnd then everyone at the bar going like,\n\n17:45.460 --> 17:47.220\noh shit, we're all white, aren't we?\n\n17:47.220 --> 17:52.220\nAh, ah, ah, don't think about it, don't think about it.\n\n17:52.220 --> 17:54.500\nAnd like everything getting so complicated\n\n17:54.500 --> 17:57.660\nthat you're in an argument about, about pinballing.\n\n17:58.660 --> 18:00.860\nAnd every, but meanwhile everything's fine,\n\n18:00.860 --> 18:02.860\nbut everyone's just worried.\n\n18:02.860 --> 18:06.020\nAnyways, let's, let's, let's, let's,\n\n18:06.020 --> 18:07.540\nlet's make a new friend, shall we?\n\n18:07.540 --> 18:08.620\nI'd love to, Dan.\n\n18:08.620 --> 18:11.940\nBut really an old soulmate, if you think about it,\n\n18:11.940 --> 18:13.700\nI was reading her book today.\n\n18:13.700 --> 18:17.100\nAnd yeah, her, her, her story is very, very interesting.\n\n18:17.100 --> 18:19.300\nSo her latest book is sort of a memoir\n\n18:19.300 --> 18:22.500\nand takes you through the whole, her whole origin\n\n18:22.500 --> 18:24.100\nand, and everything.\n\n18:24.100 --> 18:28.060\nAnd like, I like, I also got, it got,\n\n18:28.060 --> 18:31.620\nit gets very like surprisingly kind of like revelatory,\n\n18:31.620 --> 18:34.380\nself-exploratory and like confessional.\n\n18:35.660 --> 18:38.780\nBut it's also very, very, very lighthearted and adorable.\n\n18:38.780 --> 18:40.140\nBut it's a, it's a, it's a good book.\n\n18:40.140 --> 18:42.100\nYou should check it out.\n\n18:42.100 --> 18:44.420\nWe'll let her talk about it and plug it and you can buy it\n\n18:44.420 --> 18:45.780\ncause I'll probably get the title wrong,\n\n18:45.780 --> 18:49.340\neven though I just read it, because I really listened to it.\n\n18:49.340 --> 18:51.860\nSo it's just an arrow to me.\n\n18:51.860 --> 18:54.340\nJust go out to the store and buy the black arrow.\n\n18:55.460 --> 18:59.380\nIt's four hours and 12 minutes at the speed 1.25.\n\n19:00.500 --> 19:04.020\nPlease welcome someone who has never, ever called herself\n\n19:04.020 --> 19:06.580\nthe queen of the nerds, but is called that\n\n19:06.580 --> 19:08.660\nby other people, Felicia Day.\n\n19:08.660 --> 19:13.660\nI think they like it when you sit near Jabba.\n\n19:20.100 --> 19:20.940\nHello.\n\n19:22.780 --> 19:24.420\nOh.\n\n19:24.420 --> 19:25.260\nAll right.\n\n19:25.260 --> 19:27.180\nSo I tell this to everybody, but it's, it's, it's,\n\n19:27.180 --> 19:29.940\nwhat you'll notice is it's five degrees hotter up here.\n\n19:29.940 --> 19:31.420\nSo you can see me sweating.\n\n19:31.420 --> 19:32.260\nIt's your beard.\n\n19:32.260 --> 19:33.260\nIt's not because I'm fat.\n\n19:33.260 --> 19:36.300\nIt's a, it's cooler out there.\n\n19:36.300 --> 19:37.140\nI would.\n\n19:37.140 --> 19:37.980\nYeah. If you shaved your beard,\n\n19:37.980 --> 19:39.060\nit'd probably be a lot cooler.\n\n19:39.060 --> 19:40.660\nNo, let me speak to that real quick.\n\n19:40.660 --> 19:41.500\nOh shit.\n\n19:42.340 --> 19:44.580\nA beard is actually much like a heat sink\n\n19:44.580 --> 19:48.860\nwhere the face heat and sweat, it travels down the beard\n\n19:48.860 --> 19:52.380\nand dissipates, well, dissipate.\n\n19:52.380 --> 19:53.220\nIt dissipate.\n\n19:53.220 --> 19:56.140\nWell, I mean, most people would call it dripping, but.\n\n19:58.460 --> 20:00.700\nI'm going to start coughing like a cat in a hair ball,\n\n20:00.700 --> 20:02.780\nwhich is the last thing you want to wake up to ever.\n\n20:02.780 --> 20:03.620\nOh man.\n\n20:04.940 --> 20:05.780\nThat thing.\n\n20:05.780 --> 20:06.620\nThat's my alarm.\n\n20:06.620 --> 20:07.460\nHi.\n\n20:07.460 --> 20:08.300\nYou leap right off.\n\n20:08.300 --> 20:09.140\nAll right.\n\n20:09.140 --> 20:10.420\nFelicia Day, thank you for coming.\n\n20:10.420 --> 20:13.540\nIt's, it's, it's, it seems like overdue that you're here.\n\n20:13.540 --> 20:14.620\nTo me, it does anyway.\n\n20:14.620 --> 20:15.460\nI don't know.\n\n20:15.460 --> 20:16.300\nI don't know what you think of.\n\n20:16.300 --> 20:17.380\nI mean, you invited me.\n\n20:17.380 --> 20:18.220\nI would have been here.\n\n20:18.220 --> 20:20.460\nI would have been here yesterday without an invite,\n\n20:20.460 --> 20:21.540\nwhich would have been creepy.\n\n20:21.540 --> 20:22.380\nOh, okay.\n\n20:22.380 --> 20:24.580\nCause I feel like I'm, I'm, I've always, I've always,\n\n20:24.580 --> 20:27.500\nyou've always been out there on my radar, but I've always been.\n\n20:27.500 --> 20:30.380\nI mean, one thing that we will be talking about is how,\n\n20:30.380 --> 20:31.780\nI think we're both workaholics.\n\n20:31.780 --> 20:34.380\nI think you expounded on, I mean, you're definitely\n\n20:34.380 --> 20:36.980\ndiagnosable and like had to, had to overcome it.\n\n20:36.980 --> 20:37.820\nLike I'm.\n\n20:37.820 --> 20:38.660\nThanks, Dan.\n\n20:38.660 --> 20:42.260\nBut I mean, you're also now, you've gotten past it.\n\n20:42.260 --> 20:43.820\nAnd I was like hearing your book and going like,\n\n20:43.820 --> 20:46.620\nI'm fucked up and I gotta, I'm not, I'm not through this.\n\n20:46.620 --> 20:48.140\nI've seen way more together in that book.\n\n20:48.140 --> 20:50.300\nLike I, just the other day I was like,\n\n20:50.300 --> 20:51.820\nwell, you're not working on anything.\n\n20:51.820 --> 20:52.780\nGo ahead and die.\n\n20:54.180 --> 20:56.180\nSo, I mean, it's still there, but at least I'm,\n\n20:56.180 --> 20:59.460\nI can acknowledge the fact that, oh, you're a workaholic.\n\n20:59.460 --> 21:01.780\nYou should definitely go play Witcher.\n\n21:01.780 --> 21:04.100\nBecause you're working on yourself.\n\n21:04.100 --> 21:04.940\nRight.\n\n21:04.940 --> 21:08.500\nMy therapist says that when I'm playing Witcher,\n\n21:08.500 --> 21:11.100\nI'm actually just satisfying an addiction\n\n21:11.100 --> 21:15.220\nto the nervous system being like kind of stressed out.\n\n21:15.220 --> 21:16.060\nBut I'm not.\n\n21:16.060 --> 21:16.900\nIs that true?\n\n21:16.900 --> 21:18.700\nI mean, she's not like anti-video game.\n\n21:18.700 --> 21:19.620\nSounds like it.\n\n21:19.620 --> 21:22.740\nWell, I mean, it took her a long time to get there.\n\n21:22.740 --> 21:24.900\nLike she never said, stop playing video games.\n\n21:24.900 --> 21:26.260\nShe's like, come on.\n\n21:26.260 --> 21:28.420\nLike, how, like, how come you're not relaxed\n\n21:28.420 --> 21:29.420\nafter you play these things?\n\n21:29.420 --> 21:31.500\nWhich is like, makes me think of my mom,\n\n21:31.500 --> 21:33.300\nlike when you were 10 years old and you'd go like,\n\n21:33.300 --> 21:34.980\ngod damn it, and your mom would call out\n\n21:34.980 --> 21:36.180\nfrom the other room like,\n\n21:36.180 --> 21:38.660\nwhy do you play a game that makes you so upset?\n\n21:38.660 --> 21:43.660\nOh, cause, oh, cause you loved stick ball so much, you bitch.\n\n21:49.340 --> 21:51.540\nWhat, kick ball or stick ball?\n\n21:51.540 --> 21:52.380\nShut up.\n\n21:52.380 --> 21:54.580\nYou never speak perfectly either.\n\n21:54.580 --> 21:56.580\nI'm gonna get paid to do it one day.\n\n21:56.580 --> 21:57.780\nWhat, speak?\n\n21:57.780 --> 21:58.620\nYeah.\n\n21:59.660 --> 22:02.380\nOkay, you can't even walk on a balance beam\n\n22:02.380 --> 22:03.940\nor use right-handed scissors.\n\n22:05.940 --> 22:07.100\nYou use left-handed scissors?\n\n22:07.100 --> 22:08.780\nI had to, well, I can't use any scissors.\n\n22:08.780 --> 22:09.620\nI couldn't.\n\n22:11.620 --> 22:13.540\nMy mom had to talk the principle\n\n22:13.540 --> 22:15.820\ninto not holding me back in kindergarten.\n\n22:15.820 --> 22:17.580\nOh, you're kidding, that happened to me.\n\n22:17.580 --> 22:19.660\nThat happened to me the one year I actually went to school,\n\n22:19.660 --> 22:21.660\nthey wanted to put me in the slow class\n\n22:21.660 --> 22:32.860\nbecause I held, I scissored toward myself.\n\n22:32.860 --> 22:35.340\nBecause you're not supposed to be able to read\n\n22:35.340 --> 22:36.660\nat a college level.\n\n22:40.340 --> 22:43.180\nThe tests have nothing to do with reading comprehension.\n\n22:43.180 --> 22:45.140\nThey put you on a balance beam.\n\n22:45.140 --> 22:45.980\nWhat?\n\n22:45.980 --> 22:47.500\nThat's like how you test a cat.\n\n22:47.500 --> 22:48.340\nOh.\n\n22:49.940 --> 22:50.940\nWhat does that have to do?\n\n22:50.940 --> 22:54.220\nOh, this person's gonna need to balance?\n\n22:54.220 --> 22:55.380\nAnother thing that happened to me,\n\n22:55.380 --> 22:58.140\nI had only vivid memories from the one year I went to school\n\n22:58.140 --> 23:00.340\nand then I was sequestered for the rest of my life,\n\n23:00.340 --> 23:02.420\nwhich we'll talk about.\n\n23:02.420 --> 23:03.540\nThere was a girl named Jennifer\n\n23:03.540 --> 23:06.500\nand she was balancing on the balance beam\n\n23:06.500 --> 23:08.500\nbecause we had a thing we had to do.\n\n23:08.500 --> 23:11.380\nBitch poked me in the eye with her nail\n\n23:11.380 --> 23:15.500\nand I had to be a pirate for two years in a row at Halloween.\n\n23:15.500 --> 23:20.180\nWas this during the, was this a high stakes balancing thing?\n\n23:20.180 --> 23:22.380\nI don't, no, it was some, you know,\n\n23:22.380 --> 23:24.700\nwe all knew we had to like show the teacher\n\n23:24.700 --> 23:26.100\nthat we were gonna go across the tires.\n\n23:26.100 --> 23:27.580\nSo we were like, let's study\n\n23:27.580 --> 23:29.340\nbecause that was what we were calling back then.\n\n23:29.340 --> 23:30.940\nYou could have been Rooster Cogburn.\n\n23:30.940 --> 23:32.500\nYou didn't have to be a pirate.\n\n23:32.500 --> 23:34.340\nThank you.\n\n23:34.340 --> 23:35.420\nOr Snake Plisken.\n\n23:35.420 --> 23:36.260\nTrue grit.\n\n23:36.260 --> 23:37.780\nOh yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n23:37.780 --> 23:39.780\nWell, I was just telling the story last week\n\n23:39.780 --> 23:41.740\nabout when I went to daycare\n\n23:41.740 --> 23:43.420\nand a girl stick a crayon in my mouth\n\n23:43.420 --> 23:46.500\nand I was just a distinct memory of the violation,\n\n23:46.500 --> 23:48.420\nthe poking, the probing.\n\n23:48.420 --> 23:49.540\nWhat color was it?\n\n23:49.540 --> 23:50.940\nIt was red.\n\n23:50.940 --> 23:51.780\nEw.\n\n23:51.780 --> 23:52.940\nShe was trying to play lipstick.\n\n23:52.940 --> 23:53.940\nI think she had a crush on me.\n\n23:53.940 --> 23:55.180\nI gave her that credit.\n\n23:55.180 --> 23:56.260\nOkay.\n\n23:56.260 --> 23:57.180\nListen to the episode.\n\n23:57.180 --> 23:58.020\nIt's great.\n\n23:58.020 --> 24:01.620\nBut so since we're there,\n\n24:01.620 --> 24:03.460\nI mean you keep saying the one year I went to school\n\n24:03.460 --> 24:05.180\nbecause like, I don't know\n\n24:05.180 --> 24:07.220\nif I've ever met a homeschooled person.\n\n24:07.220 --> 24:10.220\nLike, and I certainly wouldn't picture them as like, you know,\n\n24:10.220 --> 24:12.580\neven though I think one of the stereotypes is like\n\n24:12.580 --> 24:15.580\nthat they're not, they're more, they're, they're,\n\n24:15.580 --> 24:18.140\nthey're capable, they're capable,\n\n24:18.140 --> 24:22.220\nbut you know, but you know, you know, yeah,\n\n24:22.220 --> 24:24.900\nI wouldn't, I wouldn't guess like, oh, homeschooled,\n\n24:24.900 --> 24:25.740\nbut, but yeah, I mean,\n\n24:25.740 --> 24:26.580\nYou don't like homeschooled?\n\n24:26.580 --> 24:27.420\nYou don't like homeschooled?\n\n24:27.420 --> 24:29.220\nYou don't like homeschooled?\n\n24:29.220 --> 24:30.060\nShut the fuck up.\n\n24:30.060 --> 24:31.540\nShut the fuck up.\n\n24:31.540 --> 24:32.380\nI can shut up.\n\n24:39.380 --> 24:42.780\nBut your, your mom, your mom pulled you\n\n24:42.780 --> 24:45.540\nand your brother out of school when you were kids\n\n24:45.540 --> 24:48.620\nbecause, and it's because you, you were hoisted\n\n24:48.620 --> 24:51.580\nby your own petard, as we say on this show.\n\n24:52.500 --> 24:56.020\nPetards are special pants made of pride.\n\n24:58.020 --> 25:00.220\nI'll explain later, but the, you, you,\n\n25:00.220 --> 25:01.580\nthere's some, sorry, like, like,\n\n25:01.580 --> 25:03.500\nbecause it was like a paroch, it was like a,\n\n25:03.500 --> 25:05.100\nWe went, we moved to Mississippi.\n\n25:05.100 --> 25:07.340\nSo we were from Alabama, which was already a problem.\n\n25:07.340 --> 25:10.420\nAnd then we were moving to the Gulf Coast of Mississippi,\n\n25:10.420 --> 25:13.020\nwhich was a big problem because that was Hickville\n\n25:13.020 --> 25:14.780\nto the people in Alabama.\n\n25:14.780 --> 25:17.420\nSo that was Sub Hickville.\n\n25:17.420 --> 25:18.980\nAnd then my mom was concerned\n\n25:18.980 --> 25:21.500\nbecause all my family is very highly educated\n\n25:21.500 --> 25:24.980\nand it was like the worst school system in the world.\n\n25:24.980 --> 25:27.260\nSo she was like, let's call one place.\n\n25:27.260 --> 25:28.340\nThey make you wear uniforms.\n\n25:28.340 --> 25:30.380\nNope, you're not going to school.\n\n25:30.380 --> 25:31.860\nThat was, it's, that's it.\n\n25:31.860 --> 25:32.700\nYeah.\n\n25:32.700 --> 25:35.380\nLiterally what she did.\n\n25:35.380 --> 25:38.100\nBut in your, in your mom did a, you know,\n\n25:38.100 --> 25:40.260\nthe kind of job I think we all picture ourselves doing\n\n25:40.260 --> 25:43.140\nas we tried to teach our kids in homes, as homeschooling.\n\n25:43.140 --> 25:46.580\nThe beginning of the day slipped to around Nunesh and,\n\n25:46.580 --> 25:47.420\nYeah.\n\n25:47.420 --> 25:49.860\nShe ordered all these like, it's called Calvert School\n\n25:49.860 --> 25:52.580\nand it's what missionaries use to teach their children.\n\n25:52.580 --> 25:55.140\nAnd they literally come in just white books,\n\n25:55.140 --> 25:59.660\nkind of like the, the, the generic cereal at the grocery.\n\n25:59.660 --> 26:01.420\nWhy are you creepily taking pictures of me?\n\n26:01.420 --> 26:02.260\nDon't worry.\n\n26:02.260 --> 26:03.100\nDon't worry.\n\n26:03.100 --> 26:03.940\nYou don't like photos?\n\n26:03.940 --> 26:08.300\nYou don't like photography?\n\n26:09.580 --> 26:10.740\nWeird angle.\n\n26:10.740 --> 26:11.580\nAnyway.\n\n26:11.580 --> 26:12.420\nThat's good, trust me.\n\n26:12.420 --> 26:15.380\nNo, that sounds broken.\n\n26:17.380 --> 26:18.580\nI'll post it on Instagram.\n\n26:18.580 --> 26:19.420\nYou'll see.\n\n26:19.420 --> 26:20.260\nIt's a cool photo.\n\n26:20.260 --> 26:21.340\nHe is, he is a good photographer.\n\n26:21.340 --> 26:22.180\nFilter it up.\n\n26:22.180 --> 26:23.020\nUm, yeah.\n\n26:23.020 --> 26:24.980\nSo anyway, she, she, she ordered all these books\n\n26:24.980 --> 26:26.340\nand we were like, yeah, learning.\n\n26:26.340 --> 26:30.580\nAnd then she never woke up like before noon.\n\n26:30.580 --> 26:32.900\nSo I would be like, well, I'm going to educate myself.\n\n26:32.900 --> 26:34.700\nSo I would have a strict regiment of like\n\n26:34.700 --> 26:36.180\nlost in spaces at 10 a.m.\n\n26:36.180 --> 26:38.980\nYou better do three math problems before then.\n\n26:38.980 --> 26:41.140\nAnd I felt like, yeah, I'm really educating myself.\n\n26:41.140 --> 26:44.580\nLike that, that was the totality of my childhood.\n\n26:44.580 --> 26:48.220\nBasically programming myself around old noir films,\n\n26:48.220 --> 26:51.140\nmusicals, old science fiction things,\n\n26:51.140 --> 26:54.980\nand then eating buffalo wings at the TGI Fridays.\n\n26:54.980 --> 26:56.900\nAnd at one point you're like a violin prodigy\n\n26:56.900 --> 26:58.500\nand that's like actually you're, you're, you're,\n\n26:58.500 --> 27:00.580\nyou're one of these kids that's in college\n\n27:00.580 --> 27:02.940\nat the age of 16 or whatever, which is like,\n\n27:02.940 --> 27:05.340\nlike worms are in Revenge of the Nerds.\n\n27:05.340 --> 27:08.340\nThe, but what, what, how old were you when this,\n\n27:08.340 --> 27:12.020\nthis weird chapter happened where your mom\n\n27:12.020 --> 27:14.460\nwas grooming you to be the new Selena?\n\n27:14.460 --> 27:15.740\nOkay, it's true.\n\n27:15.740 --> 27:16.580\nOkay.\n\n27:18.580 --> 27:21.820\nIt was such a strange like flash.\n\n27:21.820 --> 27:23.700\nI mean, we were living in San Antonio\n\n27:23.700 --> 27:25.500\nand that's the heart of, of Tejano.\n\n27:25.500 --> 27:27.900\nSo I don't know why you would think it would be inappropriate.\n\n27:27.900 --> 27:32.900\nI mean, I don't speak Spanish or sing or speak Spanish\n\n27:34.140 --> 27:35.940\nor any of the things that you need to do\n\n27:35.940 --> 27:38.100\nto be a Tejano star, but that does not,\n\n27:38.100 --> 27:39.860\nmy mom's the kind of person who will,\n\n27:39.860 --> 27:42.140\nwell, first of all, she, I just found out the other day\n\n27:42.140 --> 27:44.180\nthat she crashed a car into somebody in Austin\n\n27:44.180 --> 27:45.340\nand immediately got out of the car\n\n27:45.340 --> 27:47.180\nand was like, I'm Felicia Day's mother.\n\n27:49.180 --> 27:50.900\nAnd it actually worked.\n\n27:50.900 --> 27:53.740\nIt worked situationally in Austin,\n\n27:53.740 --> 27:54.580\nbut then it got-\n\n27:54.580 --> 27:55.420\nBecause she hit Wil Wheaton.\n\n27:55.420 --> 27:56.260\nYeah.\n\n28:01.260 --> 28:03.620\nWho is just driving around your mom's neighborhood.\n\n28:03.620 --> 28:08.620\nWith Steve's camera, but no, she's the kind of person\n\n28:10.060 --> 28:12.340\nwho we would go, when she would eventually wake up,\n\n28:12.340 --> 28:16.140\nwe would go into the mall for hours while she browsed\n\n28:16.140 --> 28:18.420\nand we would sit inside the merry-go-round of shame.\n\n28:18.420 --> 28:20.020\nYou know, you just get in there as kids\n\n28:20.020 --> 28:22.020\nand you're like, just twirl the clothes around me\n\n28:22.020 --> 28:22.980\nand I'll be in a different place.\n\n28:22.980 --> 28:24.060\nPlease God.\n\n28:24.060 --> 28:25.900\nBut she would tell the Clinique sales woman\n\n28:25.900 --> 28:28.820\nabout my pirouettes and I would be forced to do pirouettes\n\n28:28.820 --> 28:31.700\nto everybody in the makeup department at like 9 p.m.\n\n28:31.700 --> 28:35.020\nSo this is, I mean, she's very enthusiastic with my abilities.\n\n28:35.020 --> 28:36.540\nSo whenever she met somebody\n\n28:36.540 --> 28:38.940\nwho could possibly make me more of a star,\n\n28:38.940 --> 28:40.220\nshe would glom on to them\n\n28:40.220 --> 28:42.380\nand one of them happened to be a Tejano producer\n\n28:42.380 --> 28:45.220\nwho had a garage that he recorded music in.\n\n28:45.220 --> 28:47.660\nAnd therefore that was like a door opening\n\n28:47.660 --> 28:52.340\nto my star happening as a Tejano singer,\n\n28:52.340 --> 28:55.980\nwhich is kind of an accordion Hispanic Tex-Mex music\n\n28:55.980 --> 28:57.780\nif you're not familiar with Tejano.\n\n28:57.780 --> 28:59.140\nIt's very jolly.\n\n28:59.140 --> 29:02.260\nAnd not to get grim, but in the book,\n\n29:02.260 --> 29:05.900\nthe closer on that chapter is that then,\n\n29:05.900 --> 29:07.220\nwas it Selena that she got?\n\n29:07.220 --> 29:09.220\nSelena, she got tragically was.\n\n29:09.220 --> 29:10.060\nShe was not happy.\n\n29:10.060 --> 29:10.900\nYeah.\n\n29:10.900 --> 29:13.660\nBut like, I mean, I don't know were you like,\n\n29:13.660 --> 29:16.060\nwas that really the reason why it kind of came to a close?\n\n29:16.060 --> 29:16.900\nOh no, yes.\n\n29:16.900 --> 29:18.460\nShe thought it was dangerous at that point\n\n29:18.460 --> 29:21.140\nbecause Selena's manager murdered her.\n\n29:21.140 --> 29:22.420\nNo, this is a terrible story.\n\n29:22.420 --> 29:24.780\nIt's like, have you played Life is Strange?\n\n29:24.780 --> 29:25.620\nThe video game?\n\n29:25.620 --> 29:27.620\nI actually did play like a couple levels of it.\n\n29:27.620 --> 29:29.700\nYeah, so I don't want to spoil anything,\n\n29:29.700 --> 29:33.060\nbut some deep stuff happens involving like assault.\n\n29:33.060 --> 29:36.420\nAnd why did you?\n\n29:36.420 --> 29:37.780\nThat's crazy shit, man.\n\n29:41.540 --> 29:43.260\nAnyway, so I'm streaming it.\n\n29:43.260 --> 29:46.620\nAnd I'm like, oh my god, she was date raped.\n\n29:46.620 --> 29:48.100\nSo I'm like laughing uncomfortably,\n\n29:48.100 --> 29:49.980\nwhich I'm doing right now, too, because I'm sweating,\n\n29:49.980 --> 29:52.180\nbut I'm talking about that in any jovial way.\n\n29:52.180 --> 29:53.500\nAnd can we change the subject?\n\n29:53.500 --> 29:53.980\nYeah.\n\n29:53.980 --> 29:55.220\nOK.\n\n29:55.220 --> 29:56.500\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n29:56.500 --> 29:58.740\nBut oh, is that, I wonder if that's the thing that people,\n\n29:58.740 --> 30:00.260\nyeah, I didn't know the game went there.\n\n30:00.260 --> 30:02.460\nI stopped playing it because I was like, this is girl shit.\n\n30:02.460 --> 30:06.100\nBut I enjoyed it for a little while.\n\n30:06.100 --> 30:07.100\nYou don't like feelings?\n\n30:07.100 --> 30:08.940\nI knew it was, I knew I was making a joke.\n\n30:08.940 --> 30:10.260\nI knew it was girl shit when I bought it.\n\n30:10.260 --> 30:11.820\nI mean, there's a girl that says Life is Strange.\n\n30:11.820 --> 30:13.100\nIt doesn't have an explosion on it.\n\n30:13.100 --> 30:15.340\nAnd I was like, this is girl shit in a good way.\n\n30:15.340 --> 30:16.460\nI'm 42.\n\n30:16.460 --> 30:18.820\nI'm the equivalent of a girl when I'm playing video games.\n\n30:18.820 --> 30:23.540\nSo I'm not 15.\n\n30:23.540 --> 30:26.940\nI don't want to get on a headset and yell anti-Semitic things\n\n30:26.940 --> 30:28.820\nat people that may or may not be Jewish.\n\n30:32.340 --> 30:34.420\nAnd I thought it was really, really interesting, that gimmick\n\n30:34.420 --> 30:36.460\nthat they, because that's how we've always played games,\n\n30:36.460 --> 30:38.020\nis that you save your place and then you go back.\n\n30:38.020 --> 30:40.020\nAnd the way that they made it part of the narrative was.\n\n30:40.020 --> 30:42.260\nYeah, you can rewind time and be able to.\n\n30:42.260 --> 30:44.300\nWell, did you ever play, well, I could talk about video games\n\n30:44.300 --> 30:45.940\nall day, but Brayd has also, did you ever\n\n30:45.940 --> 30:48.660\nplay that because you could rewind time?\n\n30:48.660 --> 30:49.700\nNo, what did you watch?\n\n30:49.700 --> 30:52.620\nYeah, Brayd, it was kind of one of the first big Indie\n\n30:52.620 --> 30:54.540\ngames, Brayd, yeah.\n\n30:54.540 --> 30:56.660\nAnd I think he has a new game coming out just very soon,\n\n30:56.660 --> 30:58.140\nbut after like seven years.\n\n30:58.140 --> 31:01.020\nBut Brayd, it's kind of like a more, not really Mario,\n\n31:01.020 --> 31:04.980\nbut it's Mario-ish in that those are the kind of levels,\n\n31:04.980 --> 31:06.980\nbut you have to be able to rewind time to actually get\n\n31:06.980 --> 31:07.900\nthrough the levels.\n\n31:07.900 --> 31:09.660\nSo it's a thinky game.\n\n31:09.660 --> 31:11.940\nIt's a hipster game, which is, I'm not putting it in.\n\n31:11.940 --> 31:15.340\nWell, OK, so a little bit more about hipster video games.\n\n31:15.340 --> 31:19.420\nDid you play the Juno and Green Lantern?\n\n31:19.420 --> 31:25.100\nYeah, the hard rain sequel, the heavy rain, what the fuck?\n\n31:25.100 --> 31:27.140\nOh, it's like, no, oh, Beyond Two Souls?\n\n31:27.140 --> 31:27.700\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n31:27.700 --> 31:29.180\nNo, that was not good.\n\n31:29.180 --> 31:31.620\nYou didn't like that?\n\n31:31.620 --> 31:32.580\nOh, I don't know.\n\n31:32.580 --> 31:34.580\nNo, I don't think that makes you a bad person.\n\n31:34.580 --> 31:36.820\nI'm like, oh, I really enjoyed that,\n\n31:36.820 --> 31:39.140\nand I hated the rain game.\n\n31:39.140 --> 31:39.980\nI didn't like, yeah.\n\n31:39.980 --> 31:42.260\nI thought it was so dumb, and it was the exact same mechanics,\n\n31:42.260 --> 31:44.420\nbut it was like, oh, they figured it out this time,\n\n31:44.420 --> 31:47.460\nbecause I was enjoying being Juno and having a psychic friend\n\n31:47.460 --> 31:51.420\nand coming of age, and the lowest of all of them.\n\n31:51.420 --> 31:52.620\nThat was not a girl game?\n\n31:52.620 --> 31:55.940\nNo, I was obviously being glib when I said girl game.\n\n31:55.940 --> 31:57.300\nI'm like, I know who I'm talking to,\n\n31:57.300 --> 32:00.580\nand the fact that half of the point of this interview\n\n32:00.580 --> 32:04.380\nand your career has been that there is no.\n\n32:04.380 --> 32:05.020\nLadies play games.\n\n32:05.020 --> 32:07.420\nThe irony being, and we were going\n\n32:07.420 --> 32:11.660\nto get to this eventually, that you're describing\n\n32:11.660 --> 32:14.780\nyour early life, which is very, very parallel to mine.\n\n32:14.780 --> 32:16.820\nYou're experienced with this new technology\n\n32:16.820 --> 32:18.900\nwhen we're at that age.\n\n32:18.900 --> 32:21.820\nYou and I were both the first people\n\n32:21.820 --> 32:23.860\nthat we ever held hands with or kissed,\n\n32:23.860 --> 32:25.980\nwere people that we met on computers.\n\n32:25.980 --> 32:32.620\nAnd back then, ironically, there was way more,\n\n32:32.620 --> 32:37.260\nthere was less bubbling fury.\n\n32:37.260 --> 32:39.140\nThere was a more welcoming, more equal world\n\n32:39.140 --> 32:40.580\ngender-wise back then.\n\n32:40.580 --> 32:43.300\nI think because it was nerds against the world,\n\n32:43.300 --> 32:47.620\nand now that it's so ironic that all this time later,\n\n32:47.620 --> 32:52.260\nthat there's so much more of this division.\n\n32:52.260 --> 32:55.020\nWe didn't even, I mean, it officially became a division,\n\n32:55.020 --> 32:59.220\nlike a cultural division, which is so odd.\n\n32:59.220 --> 33:00.660\nBut I guess it's not odd when you've\n\n33:00.660 --> 33:03.340\nrealized that the technology turned mainstream.\n\n33:03.340 --> 33:06.700\nAnd so back then, it was like, you had to be, you know.\n\n33:06.700 --> 33:07.620\nYou had to make efforts.\n\n33:07.620 --> 33:10.620\nYou had to get that modem to dial at the camera.\n\n33:10.620 --> 33:13.540\nYeah, and if you were the kind of person that was capable of\n\n33:13.540 --> 33:16.620\nhaving that much hatred of anybody,\n\n33:16.620 --> 33:20.700\nyou were probably better at football than, like, you know,\n\n33:20.700 --> 33:22.860\nprobably you landed on that side of the bubble.\n\n33:22.860 --> 33:24.180\nAnd we're like, I'll just play football.\n\n33:24.180 --> 33:25.020\nThis shit's hard.\n\n33:25.020 --> 33:27.100\nLike, you know, dial up a phone.\n\n33:27.100 --> 33:29.140\nAnd that's like, well, my mom needs to use it.\n\n33:29.140 --> 33:31.500\nWell, I tried to get one of those hacker, you know,\n\n33:31.500 --> 33:33.340\nI don't know, it's a, there's a hacker magazine,\n\n33:33.340 --> 33:34.620\n2600 or something like that.\n\n33:34.620 --> 33:36.740\nI remember trying to get one of those.\n\n33:36.740 --> 33:38.580\nAnd I'm like, I'm going to be a hacker.\n\n33:38.580 --> 33:39.900\nI was like, they're the coolest.\n\n33:39.900 --> 33:43.100\nAnd I, or involved like opening, like shimming up a\n\n33:43.100 --> 33:45.460\ntelephone line and opening it and knowing wires.\n\n33:45.460 --> 33:47.740\nAnd I was like, I guess I'll just play the game.\n\n33:47.740 --> 33:51.700\nWait, you went up an actual in real life.\n\n33:51.700 --> 33:54.660\nNo, in the, well, no, they were like, basically in that,\n\n33:54.660 --> 33:57.300\nin that magazine, which I think is still going on,\n\n33:57.300 --> 34:00.300\nthat they would really show you how to hack phone lines.\n\n34:00.300 --> 34:01.140\nOh yeah, yeah.\n\n34:01.140 --> 34:01.980\nIn order to-\n\n34:01.980 --> 34:02.820\nFreaking.\n\n34:02.820 --> 34:03.660\nYes, with a P.\n\n34:03.660 --> 34:04.500\nLong distance freaking.\n\n34:04.500 --> 34:05.340\nFreaking.\n\n34:05.340 --> 34:06.340\nI did that successfully a bunch.\n\n34:06.340 --> 34:07.660\nDid you really?\n\n34:07.660 --> 34:09.540\nYeah, I wasn't, I didn't earn it,\n\n34:09.540 --> 34:11.860\nbut I just like, I got codes and numbers and things.\n\n34:11.860 --> 34:15.860\nAnd I tried, I used it till I call places and not get\n\n34:15.860 --> 34:16.700\ncharged.\n\n34:16.700 --> 34:19.900\nAnd I called like naughty, naughty things that,\n\n34:19.900 --> 34:21.900\nthat charge you, but didn't get charged.\n\n34:21.900 --> 34:22.740\nCause I used like this code.\n\n34:22.740 --> 34:23.580\nSo you called sex lines?\n\n34:23.580 --> 34:25.300\nI, I just, I see.\n\n34:25.300 --> 34:27.580\nHow old, how old were you?\n\n34:27.580 --> 34:29.460\nDan, how old were you when you were doing this?\n\n34:29.460 --> 34:30.300\n39.\n\n34:35.500 --> 34:36.340\nI don't know.\n\n34:36.340 --> 34:38.780\nIt was probably like 15 or something, 14.\n\n34:38.780 --> 34:40.220\nYou didn't pay these women?\n\n34:41.220 --> 34:42.140\nThey weren't even women.\n\n34:42.140 --> 34:43.060\nThey were recordings.\n\n34:43.060 --> 34:43.900\nI will, yeah.\n\n34:43.900 --> 34:46.260\nI was not like, I'm going to talk to a lady.\n\n34:46.260 --> 34:47.100\nLike.\n\n34:47.100 --> 34:47.940\nI don't know how it works.\n\n34:47.940 --> 34:48.780\nI did that.\n\n34:48.780 --> 34:49.980\nI don't even know, I don't know either.\n\n34:49.980 --> 34:50.820\nCause I tried it once.\n\n34:50.820 --> 34:52.940\nI was just like, oh man, all these like 900 numbers\n\n34:52.940 --> 34:54.460\nthat are about sex and stuff.\n\n34:54.460 --> 34:56.020\nAnd I was like, but, and I was like, oh,\n\n34:56.020 --> 34:59.100\nso can you use these numbers, like this system to like\n\n34:59.100 --> 35:00.780\ncall one of those things and not get charged?\n\n35:00.780 --> 35:02.540\nAnd I tried it and it was just like,\n\n35:02.540 --> 35:04.380\nyou very quickly found out that it was just,\n\n35:04.380 --> 35:05.380\nyou know, it's just garbage.\n\n35:05.380 --> 35:07.500\nLike they're just trying to trick people into paying for\n\n35:07.500 --> 35:10.740\nwhat is like a big long message, you know, hang up.\n\n35:10.740 --> 35:12.700\nWell, if you want some hot, juicy action,\n\n35:12.700 --> 35:14.180\nwhy don't you press three?\n\n35:14.180 --> 35:16.060\nAnd I'm like, okay, I'll take it hot, juicy.\n\n35:16.060 --> 35:18.580\nAnd then like, and it was just like,\n\n35:18.580 --> 35:19.860\nlike, like recordings after a while.\n\n35:19.860 --> 35:21.940\nI was just like a woman, like there's like a recording\n\n35:21.940 --> 35:23.860\nof a woman going like, late at night,\n\n35:23.860 --> 35:26.860\nI like to wear my bathrobe and I hope my man comes home\n\n35:26.860 --> 35:27.700\nand gives it to me.\n\n35:27.700 --> 35:30.060\nOh, like, it was just, and it was just like\n\n35:30.060 --> 35:31.100\na shitty recording.\n\n35:31.100 --> 35:32.460\nLike it was all like.\n\n35:32.460 --> 35:33.300\nIt's still pretty hot.\n\n35:33.300 --> 35:34.140\nYou figured it out.\n\n35:34.140 --> 35:35.980\nCause I abandoned it the minute I bought one.\n\n35:35.980 --> 35:37.180\nWell, and then I never did it again.\n\n35:37.180 --> 35:38.140\nI was like, okay, there's that.\n\n35:38.140 --> 35:39.580\nAnd who am I going to call in Hong Kong?\n\n35:39.580 --> 35:43.300\nLike, but I wanted to be like Matthew Broderick, obviously.\n\n35:43.300 --> 35:44.500\nAnd of course everybody did.\n\n35:44.500 --> 35:47.660\nOr like a William Gibson that you try to read that you say,\n\n35:47.660 --> 35:48.900\noh yeah, I read that what you did.\n\n35:48.900 --> 35:49.860\nNo, I didn't read.\n\n35:49.860 --> 35:50.700\nYeah.\n\n35:50.700 --> 35:52.860\nSo it was all Matthew Broderick and Albert from\n\n35:52.860 --> 35:55.020\nlittle house of the prairie and that whiz kids show.\n\n35:55.020 --> 35:56.300\nRemember whiz kids?\n\n35:56.300 --> 35:57.140\nOh my God.\n\n35:57.140 --> 35:57.980\nI didn't want to watch whiz kids.\n\n35:57.980 --> 35:59.700\nIt lasted like 13 episodes and it was like, you know,\n\n35:59.700 --> 36:02.060\nat the height of that stuff is like Max Gale\n\n36:02.060 --> 36:06.100\nfor who was Wojahowicz from Barty Miller played a cop\n\n36:06.100 --> 36:08.380\nwho would go to this whiz kid.\n\n36:08.380 --> 36:10.780\nIt was just a total, like it was just taking war games\n\n36:10.780 --> 36:12.460\nand saying, okay, let's make a TV show.\n\n36:12.460 --> 36:17.460\nSo it was like a good natured cop going to a analog\n\n36:17.540 --> 36:20.780\nfor Matthew Broderick's character in fucking\n\n36:20.780 --> 36:22.460\nnot the producers war games.\n\n36:24.180 --> 36:26.060\nThat would be a different show.\n\n36:26.060 --> 36:26.900\nAnd there was like a cute,\n\n36:26.900 --> 36:29.300\nthere was a cute Allie Sheedy type that was like his tomboy\n\n36:29.300 --> 36:33.060\nkind of like hoodie, hoodie wearing for a friend,\n\n36:33.060 --> 36:35.100\nfriend, platonic friend.\n\n36:35.100 --> 36:36.220\nYes.\n\n36:36.220 --> 36:37.860\nUntil the time where she put a dress on you.\n\n36:37.860 --> 36:39.460\nHe was like, whoa.\n\n36:39.460 --> 36:41.660\nI mean, what do you mean I have to wear a dress\n\n36:41.660 --> 36:45.380\nand let my hair down in order to get this microchip\n\n36:45.380 --> 36:46.340\nfrom the dance.\n\n36:47.180 --> 36:51.460\nGod, no, no, no, he would hack his refrigerator.\n\n36:51.460 --> 36:52.980\nLike they would show him,\n\n36:52.980 --> 36:55.460\nthis is how magical people thought computers were.\n\n36:55.460 --> 36:58.940\nThey would show him like typing in his bedroom\n\n36:58.940 --> 37:02.980\nand then in the kitchen, his refrigerator would open\n\n37:02.980 --> 37:04.460\nand his mom would go, oh,\n\n37:04.460 --> 37:06.020\nand he'd go, sorry, mom.\n\n37:08.420 --> 37:11.860\nHe's just hacking the refrigerator to open.\n\n37:11.860 --> 37:13.860\nAnd then he would like hack traffic lights\n\n37:13.860 --> 37:16.020\nand hack like, you know, he just hack everything.\n\n37:16.020 --> 37:18.140\nBut I just read the other day that you could hack a car\n\n37:18.140 --> 37:20.540\nnow because the onboard computers are so complicated\n\n37:20.540 --> 37:23.100\nthat you could actually hack a car and drive it for somebody.\n\n37:23.100 --> 37:25.700\nYeah, that's how they killed Michael Hastings.\n\n37:25.700 --> 37:26.660\nWhat?\n\n37:26.660 --> 37:27.620\nYep.\n\n37:27.620 --> 37:29.580\nThe government killed Michael Hastings\n\n37:29.580 --> 37:34.740\nbecause he got too close to the truth.\n\n37:34.740 --> 37:38.180\nI remember this.\n\n37:38.180 --> 37:40.540\nI mean, yeah, what did he do?\n\n37:40.540 --> 37:42.500\nHe just did a lot of really, you know,\n\n37:42.500 --> 37:45.460\nreally reaching journalism that put a, you know,\n\n37:46.540 --> 37:48.460\nrevealed a lot of corruption in a defense.\n\n37:48.460 --> 37:49.620\nOh, was that by Moza?\n\n37:49.620 --> 37:51.060\nThe guy who died by Moza?\n\n37:51.060 --> 37:52.420\nYeah, no, that's the guy.\n\n37:52.420 --> 37:55.220\nAnd it was the big, you know, the big burnt patch of grass.\n\n37:55.220 --> 37:56.340\nI know, I saw that.\n\n37:56.340 --> 38:01.100\nYeah, the government released a statement that said,\n\n38:01.100 --> 38:03.620\nMichael Hastings definitely was not killed\n\n38:03.620 --> 38:07.060\nby a hacked computer or hackers hacking his computer.\n\n38:07.060 --> 38:11.060\nBut just as a completely unrelated public safety note,\n\n38:11.060 --> 38:13.540\nif you were hacked, if your computer is hacked\n\n38:13.540 --> 38:17.140\nand you were killed, it would look exactly like this.\n\n38:17.140 --> 38:19.420\nI would reiterate that it is completely.\n\n38:19.420 --> 38:21.740\nThey actually said something along those lines.\n\n38:21.740 --> 38:23.300\nIt's like, this is what it would look like\n\n38:23.300 --> 38:24.500\nif your car was hacked.\n\n38:24.500 --> 38:26.140\nIt would explode like this.\n\n38:26.140 --> 38:27.300\nIt didn't happen.\n\n38:27.300 --> 38:28.940\nThere'd be no way to know if it happened,\n\n38:28.940 --> 38:30.700\nbut we know it didn't happen.\n\n38:30.700 --> 38:32.820\nSo it's just like the most weird,\n\n38:32.820 --> 38:35.420\nthe most suspicious thing anyone could do.\n\n38:35.420 --> 38:37.300\nIf you're out there and you're close to the truth,\n\n38:37.300 --> 38:38.860\nmaybe get a little further from it.\n\n38:38.860 --> 38:40.700\nThat's all we're saying.\n\n38:40.700 --> 38:41.660\nYeah.\n\n38:41.660 --> 38:43.820\nThis guy got too close to a telephone pole.\n\n38:43.820 --> 38:45.260\nYou stay away from the truth.\n\n38:45.260 --> 38:46.540\nStay away from your refrigerator\n\n38:46.540 --> 38:48.980\nbecause somebody might be able to hack it.\n\n38:48.980 --> 38:50.100\nSo anyways, back then,\n\n38:50.100 --> 38:52.300\nsorry, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue.\n\n38:52.300 --> 38:55.660\nThe big plot point of your career\n\n38:55.660 --> 38:57.380\nis World of Warcraft,\n\n38:57.380 --> 38:59.020\nbecause obviously,\n\n38:59.020 --> 39:00.780\nor maybe not obviously for people listening,\n\n39:00.780 --> 39:03.380\nlike your community,\n\n39:05.060 --> 39:06.140\nthe weird metric to use.\n\n39:06.140 --> 39:07.820\nBut I'm narcissistic, so I'm reading a book\n\n39:07.820 --> 39:09.460\nand I'm only understanding it through parallels\n\n39:09.460 --> 39:12.020\nthrough my life, which is happening at the same time.\n\n39:12.020 --> 39:14.700\nThe world's shittiest biopic would be like cutting back\n\n39:14.700 --> 39:16.060\nand forth between what's going on with you\n\n39:16.060 --> 39:17.380\nand what's going on with me.\n\n39:17.380 --> 39:18.980\nAnd we don't know each other,\n\n39:18.980 --> 39:19.820\nbut it's like, I don't know.\n\n39:19.820 --> 39:21.260\nThere would be no reason to do it\n\n39:21.260 --> 39:23.300\nother than the fact that it structurally works out\n\n39:23.300 --> 39:24.660\nreally perfectly.\n\n39:24.660 --> 39:26.780\nBecause it's like, during season four,\n\n39:26.780 --> 39:31.060\nit was interesting reading it.\n\n39:31.060 --> 39:36.060\nBut your community is based on your community college,\n\n39:36.260 --> 39:38.980\nwhich is you experiencing World of Warcraft,\n\n39:38.980 --> 39:40.700\nand you got seriously like,\n\n39:40.700 --> 39:42.180\nI was surprised at your description\n\n39:42.180 --> 39:44.620\nof how hard the addiction was.\n\n39:44.620 --> 39:45.660\nAnd it sounds on paper,\n\n39:45.660 --> 39:47.020\njust as you're describing in one line,\n\n39:47.020 --> 39:48.700\nlike video game addiction.\n\n39:48.700 --> 39:51.340\nFirst of all, you have a tendency to laugh it off\n\n39:51.340 --> 39:53.060\nbecause it seems like a silly thing to be addicted to.\n\n39:53.060 --> 39:55.300\nSecond of all, with the extent that you do start\n\n39:55.300 --> 39:56.460\nto take it seriously,\n\n39:56.460 --> 39:59.180\nyou would therefore then lose all respect for the game.\n\n39:59.180 --> 40:01.460\nBut you weave those highway cones\n\n40:01.460 --> 40:03.460\nbecause you're like, this is fucking serious shit.\n\n40:03.460 --> 40:05.100\nLike I, my life got,\n\n40:05.100 --> 40:06.500\nbecause it started as a great thing\n\n40:06.500 --> 40:07.780\nthat made you feel good.\n\n40:07.780 --> 40:09.660\nLike at a low time in your life,\n\n40:09.660 --> 40:12.900\nyou were like, you were already trying to act\n\n40:12.900 --> 40:14.260\nand doing these auditions,\n\n40:14.260 --> 40:16.300\nand you're sort of,\n\n40:16.300 --> 40:18.620\nyou're not actually expressing yourself,\n\n40:18.620 --> 40:21.580\nyou're not close to the truth with your art.\n\n40:21.580 --> 40:24.380\nAnd then you start playing World of Warcraft\n\n40:24.380 --> 40:25.620\nand it starts putting you in a good mood\n\n40:25.620 --> 40:26.820\nand you start feeling like\n\n40:26.820 --> 40:28.660\nyou actually are on honest ground.\n\n40:28.660 --> 40:31.100\nAnd then all of a sudden it kind of takes over your life\n\n40:31.100 --> 40:32.540\nand you stop going on an auditions\n\n40:32.540 --> 40:34.220\nand you stop doing everything.\n\n40:34.220 --> 40:36.180\nAnd you described it like in a way that made me go,\n\n40:36.180 --> 40:37.220\noh wow, this is real.\n\n40:37.220 --> 40:38.060\nCause I mean, I do have,\n\n40:38.060 --> 40:40.460\nI do have friends who the World of Warcraft,\n\n40:40.460 --> 40:43.900\nlike, like, like, like took them out,\n\n40:43.900 --> 40:47.900\ntook them off the grid of life.\n\n40:47.900 --> 40:52.900\nYeah, I mean, it was, I mean, I've seen that happen.\n\n40:54.060 --> 40:55.660\nObviously it happened to me,\n\n40:55.660 --> 40:57.740\nbut I wanted to, in my, I didn't want,\n\n40:57.740 --> 40:58.700\nI hate it when people are like,\n\n40:58.700 --> 41:01.100\noh, the inherent nature of that video game\n\n41:01.100 --> 41:02.340\nwill ruin a person's life.\n\n41:02.340 --> 41:03.660\nCause I think that's bullshit.\n\n41:03.660 --> 41:07.260\nAnd it's a simple excuse for people's problems.\n\n41:07.260 --> 41:08.580\nYou could say it about pudding or,\n\n41:08.580 --> 41:10.420\nExactly.\n\n41:10.420 --> 41:11.260\nA pudding at it.\n\n41:11.260 --> 41:12.100\nI mean, I don't,\n\n41:12.100 --> 41:13.300\nOr night bowling.\n\n41:13.300 --> 41:14.220\nNight bowling?\n\n41:14.220 --> 41:17.140\nIt's really awesome.\n\n41:18.140 --> 41:19.780\nBut to me, you know, I was,\n\n41:19.780 --> 41:22.700\nI mean, the irony was when I was actually making a living\n\n41:22.700 --> 41:24.020\nas an actor, a great living.\n\n41:24.020 --> 41:26.020\nLike you can work four or five days a year\n\n41:26.020 --> 41:28.020\nand you're a commercial actor and you can make,\n\n41:28.020 --> 41:29.340\nyou can have a great career.\n\n41:29.340 --> 41:30.700\nYou make enough money to live\n\n41:30.700 --> 41:32.860\nand then you have no fulfillment in between.\n\n41:32.860 --> 41:34.580\nAnd you can only take so many classes\n\n41:34.580 --> 41:36.460\nor go to coffee with so many actors\n\n41:36.460 --> 41:37.740\nand complain about your agents\n\n41:37.740 --> 41:40.300\nbefore you feel like, oh, this is not working for me.\n\n41:40.300 --> 41:41.220\nThis isn't doing anything good.\n\n41:41.220 --> 41:43.780\nSo my brother invited me to play World of Warcraft\n\n41:43.780 --> 41:47.340\nand I was like, whoa, I'm a warlock\n\n41:47.340 --> 41:49.380\nand I'm good at this guys.\n\n41:49.380 --> 41:51.420\nAnd it turned into this thing\n\n41:51.420 --> 41:54.340\nwhere I was getting a sense of fulfillment inside\n\n41:54.340 --> 41:56.900\nby just playing more and more and more.\n\n41:56.900 --> 41:59.020\nAnd I don't think it's inherently bad.\n\n41:59.020 --> 42:02.100\nAnd I think there, if you can moderate your behavior\n\n42:02.100 --> 42:04.860\nthat it's an amazing social and justifiable\n\n42:04.860 --> 42:05.980\nsocial outlet for you.\n\n42:05.980 --> 42:08.860\nAnd increasingly, as we have these online worlds\n\n42:08.860 --> 42:10.620\nthat are as important as our offline worlds,\n\n42:10.620 --> 42:12.980\nyou can't denigrate somebody's online life\n\n42:12.980 --> 42:15.180\nas being escapism or destructive\n\n42:15.180 --> 42:18.140\nbecause we're all gonna be living in a void one day.\n\n42:18.140 --> 42:20.580\nWe're all gonna be staring at the construction\n\n42:20.580 --> 42:21.980\nof our walls that we want to,\n\n42:21.980 --> 42:24.980\nwhich in my case will be probably a Normandy castle\n\n42:24.980 --> 42:26.380\nwith some fairy servants.\n\n42:26.380 --> 42:29.860\nAnd we're all gonna be walled off into these gardens\n\n42:29.860 --> 42:31.060\nand whether that's good or bad.\n\n42:31.060 --> 42:34.300\nLike, to me, I think that sense of fulfillment\n\n42:34.300 --> 42:36.580\nthat I got connecting to actual people\n\n42:36.580 --> 42:39.540\nbehind those other characters was very important to me.\n\n42:39.540 --> 42:41.220\nAnd I will always treasure those friendships\n\n42:41.220 --> 42:43.660\nand those raids and those clothing items\n\n42:43.660 --> 42:46.660\nthat I won on the raids and helmets and things like that.\n\n42:46.660 --> 42:48.900\nBut the problem was I didn't have anything to do with my life\n\n42:48.900 --> 42:51.340\nand I didn't know what to do to get out of the mire\n\n42:51.340 --> 42:53.740\nof the acting and to get ahead.\n\n42:53.740 --> 42:56.140\nBecause as you said, I went to college really early.\n\n42:56.140 --> 42:58.380\nI was a straight A student and I was like,\n\n42:58.380 --> 43:00.300\nI don't know where else to work hard\n\n43:00.300 --> 43:02.900\nto get ahead in this business because it's not merit based.\n\n43:02.900 --> 43:06.340\nAnd so I just, you know, World of Warcraft is merit based.\n\n43:06.340 --> 43:08.500\nI was a potion master, you know?\n\n43:08.500 --> 43:11.860\nWhat does rock bottom look like in a World of Warcraft addiction?\n\n43:11.860 --> 43:15.500\nI mean, I remember a couple examples from your book.\n\n43:15.500 --> 43:18.420\nI mean, it definitely looks like having,\n\n43:18.420 --> 43:19.860\nI mean, I'm a very organized person.\n\n43:19.860 --> 43:21.980\nI love to-do lists, but I would make a to-do list\n\n43:21.980 --> 43:23.820\nabout what I needed to do in the morning\n\n43:23.820 --> 43:26.380\nto do World of Warcraft better.\n\n43:26.380 --> 43:28.940\nSo I would literally have a strict like 8.15,\n\n43:28.940 --> 43:31.180\nyou need to wake up and have a coffee\n\n43:31.180 --> 43:33.540\nand then log on by 8.30 so you could do\n\n43:33.540 --> 43:35.500\na half hour of farming of Dreamfoil.\n\n43:35.500 --> 43:38.620\nAnd then you have to commute from Ash, you know, Ashara\n\n43:38.620 --> 43:41.460\nto whatever other region is to get the other herb.\n\n43:41.460 --> 43:42.900\nAnd then you have to start this herb.\n\n43:42.900 --> 43:44.460\nAnd I would literally like list it out.\n\n43:44.460 --> 43:45.900\nI had a very comprehensive,\n\n43:45.900 --> 43:50.020\nI would have been a really good WoW secretary for anybody.\n\n43:50.020 --> 43:53.380\nBut you also described your internet going out\n\n43:53.380 --> 43:55.540\nand you driving around in your car crying\n\n43:55.540 --> 43:56.820\nbecause the internet was out.\n\n43:56.820 --> 43:59.620\nYeah, yes, that happened too.\n\n43:59.620 --> 44:02.180\nAnd yeah, so all those things kind of added up to\n\n44:02.180 --> 44:04.620\nlike having two, three characters and, you know,\n\n44:04.620 --> 44:06.900\nplaying 12, 14 hours a day and then going to sleep,\n\n44:06.900 --> 44:08.700\ndreaming of being a cartoon character\n\n44:08.700 --> 44:09.980\nand then waking up with an agenda\n\n44:09.980 --> 44:11.340\nto be more cartoon characters.\n\n44:11.340 --> 44:14.500\nAnd it was inherent in just a place that I was in life\n\n44:14.500 --> 44:19.220\nthat I used that as sort of a balm to fill the hours\n\n44:19.220 --> 44:21.100\nthat I didn't know what else to do with\n\n44:21.100 --> 44:23.300\nbecause I didn't know how to be fulfilled otherwise.\n\n44:23.300 --> 44:27.340\nSo, I mean, I got out of it because I got in a support group\n\n44:27.340 --> 44:28.180\nwhich is terrible.\n\n44:28.180 --> 44:30.700\nI hate saying that word, it's just so dorky.\n\n44:30.700 --> 44:32.340\nBased on the secret, which is even worse.\n\n44:32.340 --> 44:37.340\nBut anyway, it actually got me, shut up, Steve.\n\n44:39.340 --> 44:40.300\nI feel ya.\n\n44:40.300 --> 44:41.540\nRemember the secret?\n\n44:42.500 --> 44:43.500\nI do.\n\n44:43.500 --> 44:44.620\nNope.\n\n44:44.620 --> 44:46.700\nYeah, of course, it wasn't that long ago.\n\n44:46.700 --> 44:48.620\nIt was, it feels like, I'm saying that.\n\n44:48.620 --> 44:49.980\nIt was like five to six years ago.\n\n44:49.980 --> 44:51.140\nSix years ago.\n\n44:51.140 --> 44:53.820\nYeah, and so basically I had this group of women\n\n44:53.820 --> 44:55.820\nwho were like, hey, come out and share your victories\n\n44:55.820 --> 44:57.460\nevery week and my only victory was like,\n\n44:57.460 --> 45:00.780\nI leveled, got a new helm and they were like,\n\n45:00.780 --> 45:02.380\nI don't understand this, this gaming.\n\n45:02.380 --> 45:03.740\nAnd you justified that by saying you're gonna\n\n45:03.740 --> 45:06.620\nwrite a pilot about that world and you eventually did.\n\n45:06.620 --> 45:08.580\nLike you have a valley in there where you're like,\n\n45:08.580 --> 45:10.220\nyou're like, this addiction is more,\n\n45:10.220 --> 45:12.180\nit's not like you're going from the joy of World of Warcraft\n\n45:12.180 --> 45:13.260\nto writing a pilot about it.\n\n45:13.260 --> 45:15.500\nIt's like, wow, I mean, like you're like,\n\n45:15.500 --> 45:16.340\nbottoming out.\n\n45:16.340 --> 45:17.540\nYou're like a junkie on World of Warcraft,\n\n45:17.540 --> 45:19.700\nbut then you get out of it by stopping playing it\n\n45:19.700 --> 45:21.300\nand writing about it instead.\n\n45:21.300 --> 45:23.180\nAnd as you write this pilot,\n\n45:23.180 --> 45:26.420\nand then like you and your friends from that group\n\n45:26.420 --> 45:27.940\nbased on the secret, like.\n\n45:27.940 --> 45:29.020\nI mean, it was tangentially,\n\n45:29.020 --> 45:31.100\nI did not know it was based on the secret.\n\n45:31.100 --> 45:32.820\nThey read like the back cover of the secret\n\n45:32.820 --> 45:33.820\nand said, you can do whatever you want.\n\n45:33.820 --> 45:34.980\nAnd they're like, let's form a group then.\n\n45:34.980 --> 45:38.620\nOkay, no, no, don't say, was that really the truth?\n\n45:38.620 --> 45:40.700\nBecause that would be even sadder.\n\n45:40.700 --> 45:42.060\nNo, I didn't know it was on the,\n\n45:42.060 --> 45:44.060\nI think it was just tangential in the forming of the group\n\n45:44.060 --> 45:47.540\nbefore I was there and I don't mean to, now I'm sweating.\n\n45:47.540 --> 45:48.780\nAnyway, so it was fine.\n\n45:48.780 --> 45:51.060\nIt was four or five ladies and every week we'd get together\n\n45:51.060 --> 45:52.820\nand I wrote the script and nobody wanted to make it\n\n45:52.820 --> 45:53.660\nbecause they were like,\n\n45:53.660 --> 45:55.260\nI don't understand how you use a computer\n\n45:55.260 --> 45:57.460\nto talk to other people with a game\n\n45:57.460 --> 45:59.580\nbecause that was seven, eight years ago\n\n45:59.580 --> 46:03.660\nand people were not that savvy\n\n46:03.660 --> 46:05.100\nand YouTube had just started.\n\n46:05.100 --> 46:07.380\nSo my friend was like, let's shoot it and put it online.\n\n46:07.380 --> 46:10.100\nAnd that was literally the start of everything I've done.\n\n46:10.100 --> 46:12.180\nJust kind of braving the terror\n\n46:12.180 --> 46:14.060\nand deciding to pick up a camera and shoot.\n\n46:14.060 --> 46:15.260\nYeah, and you hunkered down\n\n46:15.260 --> 46:17.340\nand like the description of the shit,\n\n46:17.340 --> 46:20.460\nthe amount of work that you guys put into that thing.\n\n46:20.460 --> 46:23.300\nWell, not accepting help from a system that was like,\n\n46:23.300 --> 46:27.140\nwell, we'll do this, but we'll own it all and stuff\n\n46:27.140 --> 46:30.300\nand you repeatedly kept resisting that urge\n\n46:30.300 --> 46:32.340\nand we're really one of the first,\n\n46:32.340 --> 46:34.340\nI mean, because this is back again,\n\n46:34.340 --> 46:37.620\nanother, you know, I'm going like, I remember then,\n\n46:37.620 --> 46:39.660\nI wasn't paying any attention to what you were doing.\n\n46:39.660 --> 46:41.860\nI had my head on my own ass, but it was channel 101.\n\n46:41.860 --> 46:42.700\nIt's like.\n\n46:42.700 --> 46:44.540\nI did a couple of those like randomly\n\n46:44.540 --> 46:46.420\nand I thought that was, I mean,\n\n46:46.420 --> 46:48.300\nbut I never would be, I acted in a couple,\n\n46:48.300 --> 46:50.340\nbut I never would have been brave enough to pick it up\n\n46:50.340 --> 46:52.900\nbecause I didn't have any experience filmmaking, you know?\n\n46:52.900 --> 46:55.100\nI mean, what you did was like revolutionary\n\n46:55.100 --> 46:58.140\nand that it was internet video before internet video\n\n46:58.140 --> 46:58.980\nwas a thing, right?\n\n46:58.980 --> 46:59.820\nThank you.\n\n46:59.820 --> 47:01.700\nYeah.\n\n47:01.700 --> 47:03.220\nChannel 101 predated YouTube,\n\n47:03.220 --> 47:05.500\nbut then you're doing this in like a slightly post YouTube\n\n47:05.500 --> 47:07.020\nworld, but it's like, it's all the beginning.\n\n47:07.020 --> 47:10.340\nAnd like certainly the idea of a web series, like now,\n\n47:10.340 --> 47:11.340\nI mean, y'all rocked my favorite.\n\n47:11.340 --> 47:12.860\nThat's what called the cards is.\n\n47:12.860 --> 47:14.140\nOf course, about the guilt.\n\n47:14.140 --> 47:14.980\nYeah.\n\n47:14.980 --> 47:15.820\nYeah.\n\n47:15.820 --> 47:16.660\nOh, thank you.\n\n47:16.660 --> 47:17.500\nWe haven't said it.\n\n47:17.500 --> 47:18.340\nYeah.\n\n47:18.340 --> 47:19.180\nMy web series is about the guilt.\n\n47:19.180 --> 47:20.020\nIt was called the Gild.\n\n47:20.020 --> 47:20.860\nThe Gild.\n\n47:20.860 --> 47:23.460\nBut yeah, the Yacht Rock was one of my favorite things\n\n47:23.460 --> 47:24.300\nin the world.\n\n47:24.300 --> 47:27.940\nLike, it's truly a masterpiece of cinema.\n\n47:27.940 --> 47:28.940\nThank you.\n\n47:28.940 --> 47:31.420\nIt does.\n\n47:31.420 --> 47:32.260\nWe were in that.\n\n47:32.260 --> 47:34.540\nWe were in it.\n\n47:34.540 --> 47:35.460\nDeMorge was in it.\n\n47:35.460 --> 47:38.380\nBut the guilt lasted six seasons?\n\n47:38.380 --> 47:38.980\nSix years.\n\n47:38.980 --> 47:40.260\nIt was six years of videos.\n\n47:40.260 --> 47:41.380\nAnd we actually weren't on YouTube\n\n47:41.380 --> 47:42.420\nexcept for the first season.\n\n47:42.420 --> 47:44.220\nSo we shot the first three episodes\n\n47:44.220 --> 47:46.820\nand I tell in traumatic detail about shooting in your house,\n\n47:46.820 --> 47:49.340\nwhich is not a fun thing because people will go number\n\n47:49.340 --> 47:51.020\ntwo in your toilet copiously.\n\n47:51.020 --> 47:53.340\nAnd then you'll have to clean it later,\n\n47:53.340 --> 47:54.860\nwhich is I'm a hypochondriac.\n\n47:54.860 --> 47:58.140\nI don't want anybody else's poop in my house.\n\n47:58.140 --> 48:01.780\nAnd I have to say that that's the one chapter where it was\n\n48:01.780 --> 48:07.780\nlike, she lost me because of my channel 101 background.\n\n48:07.780 --> 48:10.620\nI'm like, I'm like, I would not with not thinking\n\n48:10.620 --> 48:12.380\nthat you're a bad person, but just thinking like,\n\n48:12.380 --> 48:14.340\noh, no, we might have not been friends or something\n\n48:14.340 --> 48:15.060\nif we had encountered it.\n\n48:15.060 --> 48:17.340\nBecause I'm like, yeah, I left a Diet Coke can\n\n48:17.340 --> 48:18.420\nunder your couch mattress.\n\n48:18.420 --> 48:22.220\nI fucking, I was a boom operating for eight hours.\n\n48:22.220 --> 48:23.260\nIt's your show.\n\n48:23.260 --> 48:24.620\nOK, listen, I was trying.\n\n48:24.620 --> 48:25.260\nI had to read.\n\n48:25.260 --> 48:27.420\nThat was actually the hardest chapter to write\n\n48:27.420 --> 48:30.500\nbecause I wrote it because I don't know if you,\n\n48:30.500 --> 48:32.140\nyou start to believe your own mythology\n\n48:32.140 --> 48:35.220\nor you're just so used to telling people about the story.\n\n48:35.220 --> 48:37.340\nAnd I was so grateful and I was like,\n\n48:37.340 --> 48:39.900\nI would list every single person who came for free.\n\n48:39.900 --> 48:41.820\nAnd my editor was like, this is not good.\n\n48:41.820 --> 48:43.580\nLike no one, I understand that you\n\n48:43.580 --> 48:46.420\nwant to thank the Kenny, who is your podcaster, who\n\n48:46.420 --> 48:48.060\nshowed up to set every single day.\n\n48:48.060 --> 48:50.020\nAnd you know, and all these other people\n\n48:50.020 --> 48:52.980\nthat you're listing who volunteered, Colleen and Bob,\n\n48:52.980 --> 48:55.540\nwho were furries and they donated their furry costumes\n\n48:55.540 --> 48:59.260\nto see that by like, and I would go in copious lists of trying\n\n48:59.260 --> 49:00.180\nto thank everybody.\n\n49:00.180 --> 49:01.500\nAnd then in that chapter, she was like,\n\n49:01.500 --> 49:02.420\nyou have to be funnier.\n\n49:02.420 --> 49:04.060\nSo that was why I took the angle.\n\n49:04.060 --> 49:06.900\nAnd yes, the Coke can ring on my dining room table\n\n49:06.900 --> 49:10.780\npisses me off because I had to do like a monk guest star\n\n49:10.780 --> 49:15.820\nto pay for that table because I was going to go to Ikea.\n\n49:15.820 --> 49:17.260\nBut I was like, oh, I got a guest star.\n\n49:17.260 --> 49:19.260\nI could get a table, a real lady table.\n\n49:19.260 --> 49:24.300\nSo that's ironic because monk doesn't, he doesn't,\n\n49:24.300 --> 49:28.700\nhe's like, Sherlock Holmes, but he hates soda rings\n\n49:28.700 --> 49:29.700\non the table.\n\n49:29.700 --> 49:30.860\nHe's like, you didn't use a coaster.\n\n49:30.860 --> 49:31.740\nYou murdered him.\n\n49:31.740 --> 49:33.140\nAnd they're like, no, I didn't.\n\n49:33.140 --> 49:35.020\nHe's like, who are you going to believe?\n\n49:35.020 --> 49:36.820\nI'm a monk.\n\n49:36.820 --> 49:39.140\nI've never seen the show.\n\n49:39.140 --> 49:39.660\nYou got it.\n\n49:39.660 --> 49:41.420\nYou nailed it.\n\n49:41.420 --> 49:46.060\nBut well, I agree with your publisher who ever said that\n\n49:46.060 --> 49:51.940\nbecause it's a couple of pages or 20 minutes of audio\n\n49:51.940 --> 49:55.180\nduring which I'm like, well, come on.\n\n49:55.180 --> 49:57.540\nWho cares if someone uses a coaster?\n\n49:57.540 --> 50:00.700\nBut it's important because you're planning the seats there\n\n50:00.700 --> 50:05.820\nbecause this turns out to be a very actually needlessly,\n\n50:05.820 --> 50:07.580\nbecause it could have been a good book anyway,\n\n50:07.580 --> 50:10.900\nlike you're a likable person and you're sharing your story\n\n50:10.900 --> 50:12.220\nand people want to hear it.\n\n50:12.220 --> 50:16.380\nBut you really crucify yourself as it goes.\n\n50:16.380 --> 50:18.300\nYou walk all the way up Golgotha with this\n\n50:18.300 --> 50:22.260\nand it starts with diet Coke rings on the table,\n\n50:22.260 --> 50:24.260\nbut you're taking that somewhere and you're\n\n50:24.260 --> 50:27.460\nvery, very confessional and thorough about chronically\n\n50:27.460 --> 50:28.460\na nervous breakdown.\n\n50:28.460 --> 50:30.460\nYeah, which started way earlier than I would've\n\n50:30.460 --> 50:34.460\nwould've thought and not before I wrote about my story.\n\n50:34.460 --> 50:37.340\nWell, you used the word panic attack from the beginning.\n\n50:37.340 --> 50:39.260\nAnd I was like, I wonder if she means real panic attacks\n\n50:39.260 --> 50:41.580\nor if she's a, but.\n\n50:41.580 --> 50:42.420\nOh, no, real ones.\n\n50:42.420 --> 50:43.820\nLike I can remember vividly.\n\n50:43.820 --> 50:47.100\nI auditioned for, and it was actually when I kind of broke\n\n50:47.100 --> 50:48.300\naway from acting and it was just like,\n\n50:48.300 --> 50:49.780\nI'm going to do the web thing for a while.\n\n50:49.780 --> 50:52.420\nI was testing for a show called like Samantha Who,\n\n50:52.420 --> 50:54.220\nwhich was a Christina Applegate show.\n\n50:54.220 --> 50:57.180\nAnd it was me testing against Melissa McCarthy\n\n50:57.180 --> 50:58.180\nand an Asian girl.\n\n50:58.180 --> 51:00.020\nAnd I was like, and it was Melissa McCarthy\n\n51:00.020 --> 51:02.060\nbefore she was Melissa McCarthy.\n\n51:02.060 --> 51:02.900\nAnd.\n\n51:02.900 --> 51:03.740\nIt's when she was just Asian.\n\n51:03.740 --> 51:04.580\nYeah.\n\n51:04.580 --> 51:07.260\nIt's weird, she had a lot of surgery.\n\n51:07.260 --> 51:08.580\nIt's interesting.\n\n51:08.580 --> 51:10.420\nI mean, her community came down on her so hard\n\n51:10.420 --> 51:12.980\nabout that surgery, but it turned out it made her a superstar.\n\n51:12.980 --> 51:14.700\nIt really did.\n\n51:14.700 --> 51:16.420\nThey always say, don't get the surgery.\n\n51:16.420 --> 51:19.340\nBe true to yourself, except don't in Hollywood.\n\n51:19.340 --> 51:21.380\nBut I went in and I tested for that.\n\n51:21.380 --> 51:24.660\nAnd I literally had such a panic attack that I could not.\n\n51:24.660 --> 51:26.300\nI mean, my hand was, I'm not kidding.\n\n51:26.300 --> 51:28.700\nIt was the most, and when I had a panic attack,\n\n51:28.700 --> 51:31.380\nand I noticed, you know, in going through a lot of therapy\n\n51:31.380 --> 51:33.060\nand stuff like that, like, oh, you were plagued\n\n51:33.060 --> 51:34.420\nwith panic attacks your whole life.\n\n51:34.420 --> 51:36.460\nAnd out of body, like kind of looking like, wow,\n\n51:36.460 --> 51:37.300\nyou're terrible.\n\n51:37.300 --> 51:39.980\nLike I could see what you're doing and it's not effective.\n\n51:39.980 --> 51:41.980\nAnd it was so bad.\n\n51:41.980 --> 51:44.220\nThe audition, I walked out, and it was the most ashamed\n\n51:44.220 --> 51:45.780\nI've ever felt in my whole entire life.\n\n51:45.780 --> 51:47.220\nAnd at that point, I was just like,\n\n51:47.220 --> 51:51.820\nI think I need to back off and just do the web more.\n\n51:51.820 --> 51:53.340\nBut I don't know where I was going with this.\n\n51:53.340 --> 51:54.340\nIt was very traumatic.\n\n51:54.340 --> 51:55.220\nOh, the panic attack.\n\n51:55.220 --> 51:56.900\nIt's the guilt that starts to consume you.\n\n51:56.900 --> 51:58.580\nIronically, you create this thing.\n\n51:58.580 --> 52:03.100\nAnd again, I relate to this, like you're\n\n52:03.100 --> 52:06.980\nat the height of your, you know, your story goes\n\n52:06.980 --> 52:08.300\nfrom a meeting with the goddess, which\n\n52:08.300 --> 52:10.620\nis like Comic-Con and you're hanging out with Joss Whedon.\n\n52:10.620 --> 52:13.100\nAnd you're like, I can't believe I built myself\n\n52:13.100 --> 52:14.180\nwithout permission.\n\n52:14.180 --> 52:15.580\nYou use the phrase without permission.\n\n52:15.580 --> 52:17.580\nAnd so it's like, yeah, exactly.\n\n52:17.580 --> 52:19.580\nI did this without permission.\n\n52:19.580 --> 52:23.860\nAnd then the second half starts to take.\n\n52:23.860 --> 52:27.940\nBecause if you haven't checked in about this compulsion,\n\n52:27.940 --> 52:30.460\nthis engine, like, if the whole time everyone's just going,\n\n52:30.460 --> 52:31.780\nlike, go, get them, go, get them.\n\n52:31.780 --> 52:33.860\nAnd you're the whole time, you have these little ghosts\n\n52:33.860 --> 52:34.460\nin your head.\n\n52:34.460 --> 52:36.900\nSo then you start to get with nothing else\n\n52:36.900 --> 52:38.180\nto destroy you but yourself.\n\n52:38.180 --> 52:40.100\nYou start to destroy yourself, kind of, like.\n\n52:40.100 --> 52:40.860\nA little bit, yeah.\n\n52:40.860 --> 52:42.740\nI mean, you know, essentially, I mean,\n\n52:42.740 --> 52:44.340\nwe were shooting for six seasons.\n\n52:44.340 --> 52:45.620\nAnd it seems like, oh, you're so successful.\n\n52:45.620 --> 52:46.660\nI mean, we were successful.\n\n52:46.660 --> 52:48.020\nWe had a little bit of a budget.\n\n52:48.020 --> 52:50.260\nBut essentially, we were making extremely low budget\n\n52:50.260 --> 52:52.540\nmovie in my house for six years.\n\n52:52.540 --> 52:55.340\nI was the only writer to ever write on the Guild.\n\n52:55.340 --> 52:57.180\nAnd it was so, and not only with that,\n\n52:57.180 --> 52:59.140\nthat I did all the social media, all the marketing, all\n\n52:59.140 --> 53:00.780\nthe appearances, all the coordination.\n\n53:00.780 --> 53:03.420\nI mean, I would be on the phone, like, trying to get the cast\n\n53:03.420 --> 53:04.940\nto a convention.\n\n53:04.940 --> 53:05.700\nLike, where are you?\n\n53:05.700 --> 53:07.220\nOK, I'll go meet you outside with a badge.\n\n53:07.220 --> 53:11.180\nLike, there was no possible way to delegate in my behavior,\n\n53:11.180 --> 53:13.100\nas well as just not having resources.\n\n53:13.100 --> 53:14.300\nI mean, we had no resources.\n\n53:14.300 --> 53:16.700\nSo it looks like we got fancier every year.\n\n53:16.700 --> 53:18.940\nBut when we did, because everybody's expectation was\n\n53:18.940 --> 53:21.500\nhigher, but we really had no more resources or support\n\n53:21.500 --> 53:22.460\nto make it bigger.\n\n53:22.460 --> 53:25.100\nAnd basically, I did it by just literally working myself\n\n53:25.100 --> 53:27.340\nalmost to death.\n\n53:27.340 --> 53:29.300\nAnd I would never trade that for anything.\n\n53:29.300 --> 53:33.300\nBut I don't know if it was the most healthy way to do things,\n\n53:33.300 --> 53:35.900\nbecause when I started adding other things on,\n\n53:35.900 --> 53:37.580\nlike a company and other projects,\n\n53:37.580 --> 53:39.540\nlike, that's when I really started to collapse.\n\n53:39.540 --> 53:43.900\nYeah, so I guess I haven't collapsed yet,\n\n53:43.900 --> 53:47.060\nbut I don't know if I'm going to, like, because, yeah,\n\n53:47.060 --> 53:49.300\nthen I was like, then the parallel stopped,\n\n53:49.300 --> 53:51.220\nbecause you're like, oh, I figured this out.\n\n53:51.220 --> 53:53.740\nAnd I'm like, wait, how did you figure that out?\n\n53:53.740 --> 53:56.140\nBecause you're like, because the doctors said, like,\n\n53:56.140 --> 53:58.140\nyou're getting a horrible heartburn that\n\n53:58.140 --> 54:00.580\ncould put you at heightened risk of esophageal cancer.\n\n54:00.580 --> 54:02.740\nAnd you're like, well, wait a minute, that's my deal breaker.\n\n54:02.740 --> 54:04.660\nI'm not going to affect my, I'll be crazy,\n\n54:04.660 --> 54:06.220\nbut I'm not going to let it affect my body.\n\n54:06.220 --> 54:08.300\nSo then you just decided to stop being crazy.\n\n54:08.300 --> 54:09.580\nAnd I'm like, what?\n\n54:09.580 --> 54:12.220\nI mean, I just not, if I'm afraid to do like that,\n\n54:12.220 --> 54:14.540\nI'm definitely still crazy.\n\n54:14.540 --> 54:16.500\nWhat you said that I can't understand\n\n54:16.500 --> 54:20.220\nis that you realize that the, I don't know, paraphrasing you,\n\n54:20.220 --> 54:24.940\nbut you realize that the things you do are not who you are.\n\n54:24.940 --> 54:27.460\nI mean, that is a realization that I intellectually\n\n54:27.460 --> 54:28.300\nunderstand.\n\n54:28.300 --> 54:30.100\nAnd sometimes I feel it in my heart.\n\n54:30.100 --> 54:31.820\nBut I don't know, especially if you're\n\n54:31.820 --> 54:34.020\na business where you are something to someone\n\n54:34.020 --> 54:35.460\nthat you're not somebody.\n\n54:35.460 --> 54:38.260\nLike if you're in a position where somebody knows you,\n\n54:38.260 --> 54:42.060\nand that's fame, and what small amount that I have\n\n54:42.060 --> 54:44.980\nin very interesting areas, but like the minute you\n\n54:44.980 --> 54:49.140\nare in a situation where your work is basically\n\n54:49.140 --> 54:51.420\nin that kind of external validation\n\n54:51.420 --> 54:54.460\nis important to getting what you want done,\n\n54:54.460 --> 54:56.060\nI think that starts to mess with your head\n\n54:56.060 --> 54:58.580\nand your value starts to kind of like be sucked out\n\n54:58.580 --> 55:00.900\nonto your skin, your outer self.\n\n55:00.900 --> 55:03.140\nI don't know, is that weird?\n\n55:03.140 --> 55:04.140\nWhat?\n\n55:04.140 --> 55:06.060\nI've taken it too weird for me in this area.\n\n55:06.060 --> 55:09.140\nI mean, I don't know, like I'm a full blown, like,\n\n55:09.140 --> 55:11.420\nI didn't know, because my therapist just\n\n55:11.420 --> 55:13.060\nstarts to use this word workaholic,\n\n55:13.060 --> 55:16.380\nand I'm like, well, doesn't that mean productive?\n\n55:16.380 --> 55:21.380\nLike I'm not, and it doesn't, it doesn't,\n\n55:21.380 --> 55:25.580\nanymore than alcoholic means like, you know, a fun drunk\n\n55:25.580 --> 55:28.700\nor, you know, it's like you can be something a holic,\n\n55:28.700 --> 55:31.580\nand it doesn't have to be like a super great version of it.\n\n55:31.580 --> 55:32.860\nAnd I guess I've always, I'm like,\n\n55:32.860 --> 55:34.660\nthis is a serious problem for me,\n\n55:34.660 --> 55:36.580\nlike that I have to confront now,\n\n55:36.580 --> 55:38.380\nthat's like the root of everything\n\n55:38.380 --> 55:39.500\nthat's going wrong in my life.\n\n55:39.500 --> 55:40.500\nWhat are you doing?\n\n55:40.500 --> 55:41.900\nI just, I'm just, I don't have,\n\n55:41.900 --> 55:44.580\nI don't have an identity outside of what I do at all.\n\n55:44.580 --> 55:48.700\nLike this show is a huge part of keeping me sane\n\n55:48.700 --> 55:53.700\nbecause it's a way for me to do something\n\n55:54.020 --> 55:59.020\nwhile that involves being human and fulfilling myself.\n\n55:59.020 --> 56:02.820\nBut like, so like, because I don't, I don't,\n\n56:02.820 --> 56:04.980\nyou know, I play, like sort of my therapist,\n\n56:04.980 --> 56:07.020\nshe's like, what do you do to recharge?\n\n56:07.020 --> 56:08.380\nWhat do you do to fill up?\n\n56:08.380 --> 56:10.460\nWhat do you do to relax as I play video games?\n\n56:10.460 --> 56:12.580\nAnd she's like, okay, so what do you do in the video games?\n\n56:12.580 --> 56:15.420\nAnd I go, whoa, you know, I'm like a witcher and a,\n\n56:15.420 --> 56:18.020\nI mean, yeah, there's a lot of shit to be solved there.\n\n56:18.020 --> 56:19.500\nThese peasants are really put upon.\n\n56:19.500 --> 56:21.020\nAnd she's like, so how is that different?\n\n56:21.020 --> 56:24.980\nIf the ghoul is a guy from DreamWorks,\n\n56:24.980 --> 56:28.780\nhow is this different from the life\n\n56:28.780 --> 56:30.420\nyou just described that's incredibly stressful?\n\n56:30.420 --> 56:32.860\nAnd I was like, well, okay, I guess that you're right.\n\n56:32.860 --> 56:35.700\nThat would make a good movie.\n\n56:35.700 --> 56:38.140\nI don't think that's a good comparison though,\n\n56:38.140 --> 56:39.060\nbecause it's like.\n\n56:39.060 --> 56:40.500\nYou have you met this guy from DreamWorks?\n\n56:40.500 --> 56:44.900\nWell, I'm just saying sports, sports are very intense.\n\n56:44.900 --> 56:47.060\nYou could get really worked up and stressed out\n\n56:47.060 --> 56:49.060\njust playing sports, but no one would say,\n\n56:49.060 --> 56:50.540\nyou gotta stop playing sports, man.\n\n56:50.540 --> 56:51.380\nIt's cutting into you.\n\n56:51.380 --> 56:54.140\nWell, I think that those people exert themselves.\n\n56:54.140 --> 56:56.780\nAnd also there are probably people\n\n56:56.780 --> 56:58.700\nwho shouldn't be using sports\n\n56:58.700 --> 57:00.340\nbecause it does stress them out.\n\n57:00.340 --> 57:04.020\nBut I think that typically people who do physical things,\n\n57:04.020 --> 57:06.620\nthey exert themselves and then they physically,\n\n57:06.620 --> 57:08.340\nlike have a catharsis, you know?\n\n57:08.340 --> 57:10.620\nBecause they wear themselves out and then they go,\n\n57:10.620 --> 57:13.580\nand they have no choice but to take those big deep breaths\n\n57:13.580 --> 57:15.700\nand relax themselves and set their nervous system\n\n57:15.700 --> 57:16.700\nback to zero.\n\n57:16.700 --> 57:19.340\nBut where I don't, because I know she's right\n\n57:19.340 --> 57:22.420\nbecause I know for a fact that when I'm sitting down\n\n57:22.420 --> 57:25.220\nto play a video game, I'm absolutely,\n\n57:25.220 --> 57:26.820\nI can't wait to do it.\n\n57:26.820 --> 57:29.060\nSo you would, so then you think, oh, I'm doing this\n\n57:29.060 --> 57:30.820\nto take a break or relax.\n\n57:30.820 --> 57:34.420\nBut I'm just, like, I'm just using it to avoid,\n\n57:34.420 --> 57:35.260\nlike I'm using it to-\n\n57:35.260 --> 57:36.260\nBut what else are you gonna do?\n\n57:36.260 --> 57:37.860\nThat's a valid code to do.\n\n57:37.860 --> 57:38.700\nI mean, like-\n\n57:38.700 --> 57:39.540\nThat's what I'm saying.\n\n57:39.540 --> 57:40.380\nI get pissed off.\n\n57:40.380 --> 57:41.300\nI'm like, okay, therapist, what do you do?\n\n57:41.300 --> 57:43.340\nYou watch The Good Wife every night?\n\n57:43.340 --> 57:45.220\nAh, well-\n\n57:45.220 --> 57:48.980\nI mean, how was that better than actually participating\n\n57:48.980 --> 57:51.140\nin a story and projecting yourself\n\n57:51.140 --> 57:53.500\nas a really hot minor witcher?\n\n57:53.500 --> 57:55.500\nIf I said that, my therapist would say,\n\n57:55.500 --> 57:57.980\nwell, I curl up in the, I don't watch TV\n\n57:57.980 --> 57:59.180\nand I don't use Facebook.\n\n57:59.180 --> 58:01.220\nI curl up in the arms of my lesbian wife\n\n58:01.220 --> 58:02.780\nand I'd be like, I wrote it.\n\n58:02.780 --> 58:07.780\nShe probably really does like watch sunsets and shit.\n\n58:10.260 --> 58:11.740\nI mean, how is that better?\n\n58:11.740 --> 58:13.300\nListen, I mean-\n\n58:13.300 --> 58:14.740\nWell, because it's two lesbians doing it.\n\n58:14.740 --> 58:15.580\nFirst of all.\n\n58:15.580 --> 58:17.100\nOkay, well-\n\n58:17.100 --> 58:18.940\nSo how is it worse?\n\n58:18.940 --> 58:21.900\nI mean, I think that if you find a sense of meaning\n\n58:21.900 --> 58:24.420\nin something, and yes, sometimes you just want\n\n58:24.420 --> 58:27.340\na little bit of emptiness, like that's what TV's about.\n\n58:27.340 --> 58:30.020\nWell, I think the difference is it's like stimulation\n\n58:30.020 --> 58:32.580\nversus like coffee's a stimulant.\n\n58:32.580 --> 58:35.660\nAnd then pot like kind of makes you giggle and fall asleep.\n\n58:35.660 --> 58:36.780\nLike I think that-\n\n58:36.780 --> 58:39.140\nBut she just wants you to have more lesbian pot.\n\n58:39.140 --> 58:43.340\nYeah, yeah, that's the scissoring thing, right?\n\n58:43.340 --> 58:47.860\nThe, I think she's, I think it's accurate.\n\n58:47.860 --> 58:49.780\nI mean, I wouldn't, I wouldn't, I wouldn't,\n\n58:49.780 --> 58:51.580\nI wouldn't, if there wasn't some truth\n\n58:51.580 --> 58:53.380\nto what she was saying, like I wouldn't believe it,\n\n58:53.380 --> 58:55.140\nbut I fit, because I'm miming like\n\n58:55.140 --> 58:57.180\nan Xbox controller in my hand, and I'm like,\n\n58:57.180 --> 58:59.940\nI, it's like, I was like, oh, I'm gonna,\n\n58:59.940 --> 59:01.140\nnow I'm gonna do this, because it's like,\n\n59:01.140 --> 59:04.460\nI wanna like, I wanna jump over to doing the same thing,\n\n59:04.460 --> 59:05.780\nbut numb my brain.\n\n59:05.780 --> 59:08.100\nI don't, I'm not like taking in,\n\n59:08.100 --> 59:10.140\nI'm not like refilling my soul.\n\n59:10.140 --> 59:11.700\nBut what is-\n\n59:11.700 --> 59:12.660\nI don't know how you do that.\n\n59:12.660 --> 59:13.780\nI don't know how you do that.\n\n59:13.780 --> 59:15.500\nI don't, I mean, I think it's relative.\n\n59:15.500 --> 59:17.060\nLike what, are you supposed to learn French?\n\n59:17.060 --> 59:18.980\nOr go to, go to meet friends?\n\n59:18.980 --> 59:21.700\nI find it so ponderous to go out,\n\n59:21.700 --> 59:22.820\nif there's not a point to it.\n\n59:22.820 --> 59:23.660\nYeah, I mean, I-\n\n59:23.660 --> 59:25.580\nLike if we're not playing board games or bowling,\n\n59:25.580 --> 59:27.340\nI don't understand how I'm just supposed to sit there\n\n59:27.340 --> 59:29.300\nwith a drink in my hand and talk,\n\n59:29.300 --> 59:32.180\nmore than 30 minutes, I don't know.\n\n59:32.180 --> 59:33.020\nI don't know either.\n\n59:33.020 --> 59:33.860\nShould I see your therapist?\n\n59:33.860 --> 59:34.700\nDo you wanna see her?\n\n59:34.700 --> 59:35.540\nYeah, let's talk to her.\n\n59:35.540 --> 59:36.380\nI don't know, now I'm sweating,\n\n59:36.380 --> 59:38.580\nbecause maybe I do want a step than I thought.\n\n59:38.580 --> 59:40.220\nCan I, can I, can I just bring you in,\n\n59:40.220 --> 59:42.860\nin like a box, and, and she'll be like,\n\n59:42.860 --> 59:43.700\nwhat's in the box?\n\n59:43.700 --> 59:44.540\nI'm like, just some more work.\n\n59:44.540 --> 59:45.940\nAnd she goes, mm, workaholic,\n\n59:45.940 --> 59:46.940\nstill playing those video games.\n\n59:46.940 --> 59:48.940\nAnd we're like, yeah, tell me what you were saying\n\n59:48.940 --> 59:49.780\nbefore again.\n\n59:49.780 --> 59:51.460\nAnd she's like, mm, you gotta,\n\n59:51.460 --> 59:53.860\nyou gotta hang out with your wife and just watch a sunset.\n\n59:53.860 --> 59:57.180\nAnd then I'll open the box and you'll be like, hello.\n\n59:57.180 --> 59:58.220\nHello, I have an opinion about this.\n\n59:58.220 --> 59:59.420\nI got a bone to pick.\n\n01:00:00.980 --> 01:00:03.340\nIf I were playing video games, I would honestly be,\n\n01:00:03.340 --> 01:00:06.500\nI would be, I would, I would think that I don't feel alive\n\n01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:07.940\nif I was not learning something.\n\n01:00:07.940 --> 01:00:10.260\nSo I would be like, I'm learning French or Esperanto,\n\n01:00:10.260 --> 01:00:12.700\nor I learned Mandarin Chinese for six months\n\n01:00:12.700 --> 01:00:14.620\nbecause I needed to go to the gym\n\n01:00:14.620 --> 01:00:16.740\nand it sounded good to do that.\n\n01:00:16.740 --> 01:00:18.060\nAnd I-\n\n01:00:18.060 --> 01:00:18.900\nIs that true?\n\n01:00:18.900 --> 01:00:20.820\nI did, and I watched a Jet Lee movie\n\n01:00:20.820 --> 01:00:23.500\nand I picked out seven words and I was like, my God,\n\n01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:24.340\nI'm amazing.\n\n01:00:24.340 --> 01:00:25.180\nSeven words?\n\n01:00:25.180 --> 01:00:26.500\nI'm so amazing.\n\n01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:28.620\nBut they were words like Coca-Cola,\n\n01:00:30.020 --> 01:00:31.340\nbaseball,\n\n01:00:31.340 --> 01:00:33.500\nI'm so like-\n\n01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:34.540\nNight bowling.\n\n01:00:35.980 --> 01:00:36.900\nAnd punch.\n\n01:00:39.780 --> 01:00:41.140\nYeah, well, I don't,\n\n01:00:41.140 --> 01:00:42.300\nthis is a big topic to me.\n\n01:00:42.300 --> 01:00:43.220\nI want to figure this out,\n\n01:00:43.220 --> 01:00:46.020\nbut I think that you and I both don't have the answer,\n\n01:00:46.020 --> 01:00:46.860\nbut I think that you-\n\n01:00:46.860 --> 01:00:47.980\nI mean, isn't that just retirements?\n\n01:00:47.980 --> 01:00:48.820\nI don't know.\n\n01:00:48.820 --> 01:00:52.580\nI mean, I would feel like I was wasting my life\n\n01:00:52.580 --> 01:00:53.820\nif I was just, I mean,\n\n01:00:53.820 --> 01:00:55.260\nlooking at a sunset is nice,\n\n01:00:55.260 --> 01:00:56.740\nbut it doesn't need to be all the time,\n\n01:00:56.740 --> 01:00:58.260\nit should be a treat, right?\n\n01:00:58.260 --> 01:01:00.500\nAnd it does always just set.\n\n01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:02.460\nLike that's all it does.\n\n01:01:02.460 --> 01:01:06.780\nIt's like, boo, like these supermoon people,\n\n01:01:06.780 --> 01:01:08.300\nlike they're not going to be relaxed tonight.\n\n01:01:08.300 --> 01:01:11.780\nNo, that's literally some werewolf is assaulting\n\n01:01:11.780 --> 01:01:14.540\nan old woman right now because of that moon.\n\n01:01:14.540 --> 01:01:16.460\nThat's a big problem in LA\n\n01:01:16.460 --> 01:01:19.620\nthat we're not talking about enough.\n\n01:01:19.620 --> 01:01:20.900\nSilver Lake Beards.\n\n01:01:24.620 --> 01:01:25.460\nYeah, well-\n\n01:01:25.460 --> 01:01:26.300\nIt'd be awesome if,\n\n01:01:26.300 --> 01:01:27.220\nI'm sorry, I'm a little high,\n\n01:01:27.220 --> 01:01:29.580\nbut it'd be awesome if you made a,\n\n01:01:29.580 --> 01:01:32.260\nlike a jet that went the exact speed\n\n01:01:32.260 --> 01:01:33.780\nthat the earth rotates\n\n01:01:33.780 --> 01:01:37.820\nand you could literally just follow a fucking sunset\n\n01:01:37.820 --> 01:01:41.540\naround the world for until you ran out of gas.\n\n01:01:44.740 --> 01:01:45.940\nThat would be possible.\n\n01:01:45.940 --> 01:01:48.020\nWait, is that like a, is it like a,\n\n01:01:48.020 --> 01:01:48.860\nI missed the top.\n\n01:01:48.860 --> 01:01:50.180\nIs it like a chair?\n\n01:01:50.180 --> 01:01:53.340\nYou make like a jet and you could just chase\n\n01:01:53.340 --> 01:01:54.820\nand it was like solar powered.\n\n01:01:54.820 --> 01:01:57.780\nSo you just never had to fucking stop.\n\n01:01:57.780 --> 01:02:01.020\nAnd you're just, you're just Johnny Sunset.\n\n01:02:01.020 --> 01:02:02.420\nYou're just always.\n\n01:02:02.420 --> 01:02:03.580\nYeah.\n\n01:02:03.580 --> 01:02:05.180\nIsn't that Apollo?\n\n01:02:05.180 --> 01:02:07.540\nLike the Greek myth of Apollo is that he did that?\n\n01:02:07.540 --> 01:02:08.380\nI don't know.\n\n01:02:08.380 --> 01:02:12.140\nNo, I think Apollo's myth is that he had a wagon\n\n01:02:12.140 --> 01:02:13.780\nwith the sun as the wheel.\n\n01:02:13.780 --> 01:02:14.620\nOh.\n\n01:02:14.620 --> 01:02:15.460\nI mean, I don't know if he-\n\n01:02:15.460 --> 01:02:16.300\nAurora.\n\n01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:17.420\nThere is, there is a God.\n\n01:02:17.420 --> 01:02:21.020\nThey were a hot God who had sex with the animals did that.\n\n01:02:21.020 --> 01:02:22.380\nSounds like Apollo.\n\n01:02:22.380 --> 01:02:23.220\nPromise.\n\n01:02:24.060 --> 01:02:26.300\nNo, but the thing that I do for relaxation, by the way,\n\n01:02:26.300 --> 01:02:28.660\nthat I feel centered is I watch house hunters\n\n01:02:28.660 --> 01:02:31.060\nand I see all these stupid bastards\n\n01:02:31.060 --> 01:02:33.180\nwho get to quit their job and moved to Denmark\n\n01:02:33.180 --> 01:02:34.820\nbecause they've always wanted to.\n\n01:02:34.820 --> 01:02:36.580\nAnd I'm like, I want to do,\n\n01:02:36.580 --> 01:02:37.500\none day I'm going to do that.\n\n01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:39.020\nAnd then I feel like I've centered myself.\n\n01:02:39.020 --> 01:02:40.180\nThat sounds stressful.\n\n01:02:41.860 --> 01:02:43.500\nBut I, but I think I know what you're talking about.\n\n01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:44.740\nWhen I watch intervention,\n\n01:02:44.740 --> 01:02:45.580\nI'm always like-\n\n01:02:45.580 --> 01:02:46.420\nOh, there he goes.\n\n01:02:46.420 --> 01:02:47.260\nAh.\n\n01:02:47.260 --> 01:02:48.100\nHa ha ha.\n\n01:02:48.100 --> 01:02:48.940\nHa ha ha ha.\n\n01:02:48.940 --> 01:02:50.260\nHa ha ha ha.\n\n01:02:50.260 --> 01:02:51.100\nIs that that?\n\n01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:52.140\nForensic files for me.\n\n01:02:52.140 --> 01:02:56.540\nI think I, I had never seen one until about two months ago.\n\n01:02:56.540 --> 01:02:59.220\nI was in Baltimore in a hotel and I started watching it.\n\n01:02:59.220 --> 01:03:02.300\nAt least I could not fucking stop watching forensic.\n\n01:03:02.300 --> 01:03:03.140\nWhat is it?\n\n01:03:03.140 --> 01:03:03.980\nI've never seen it.\n\n01:03:03.980 --> 01:03:05.380\nIt, it's.\n\n01:03:05.380 --> 01:03:07.220\nHa ha ha ha.\n\n01:03:07.220 --> 01:03:08.180\nA fan right there.\n\n01:03:08.180 --> 01:03:10.420\nYou know, really hard to solve cases\n\n01:03:10.420 --> 01:03:12.860\nand they break down how they eventually solve them.\n\n01:03:12.860 --> 01:03:14.980\nYou know, they use luminol every time.\n\n01:03:16.260 --> 01:03:17.660\nAnd then, and then every once in a while,\n\n01:03:17.660 --> 01:03:19.940\nthey can't use luminol because,\n\n01:03:19.940 --> 01:03:23.300\nthe criminal had used a technique to make it luminol proof,\n\n01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:25.300\nwhich this show cannot disclose.\n\n01:03:25.300 --> 01:03:26.140\nBleach.\n\n01:03:27.140 --> 01:03:27.980\nHa ha ha ha.\n\n01:03:31.980 --> 01:03:34.220\nLike, I like, they're that worried about,\n\n01:03:34.220 --> 01:03:36.500\nabout their show having that effect.\n\n01:03:36.500 --> 01:03:37.540\nBut it's like, come on.\n\n01:03:37.540 --> 01:03:38.860\nWhat I'm learning from your show is\n\n01:03:38.860 --> 01:03:40.580\nif you're going to murder someone, own a boat.\n\n01:03:40.580 --> 01:03:41.420\nLike, like.\n\n01:03:41.420 --> 01:03:42.260\nHa ha ha.\n\n01:03:42.260 --> 01:03:44.100\nLike, nobody, no crime.\n\n01:03:45.380 --> 01:03:46.620\nAshonda Rhimes.\n\n01:03:46.620 --> 01:03:47.940\nHa ha ha ha.\n\n01:03:47.940 --> 01:03:51.260\nWhat, wait, yeah.\n\n01:03:51.260 --> 01:03:53.620\nThere's, wait, somebody else has a,\n\n01:03:53.620 --> 01:03:56.980\nLee Ann, nobody, no crime, Lee Ann Rhimes.\n\n01:03:56.980 --> 01:03:58.060\nNow that's the same syllables.\n\n01:03:58.060 --> 01:03:59.540\nWhat's luminol?\n\n01:03:59.540 --> 01:04:01.260\nLuminol is a just blood detector.\n\n01:04:01.260 --> 01:04:05.260\nIt's like, if I kill you, or if that guy kills you, let's.\n\n01:04:06.260 --> 01:04:07.580\nThe guy in the Pokemon hat.\n\n01:04:07.580 --> 01:04:09.660\nYou can mop up all the blood and it looks,\n\n01:04:09.660 --> 01:04:10.900\nyou know, it looks like it's gone.\n\n01:04:10.900 --> 01:04:13.500\nBut then they spray luminol and they shine a black light\n\n01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:16.300\nand it's just like, oh, there's all this blood.\n\n01:04:16.300 --> 01:04:18.260\nIt detects the iron or something like that.\n\n01:04:18.260 --> 01:04:19.100\nWell, that's good to know.\n\n01:04:19.100 --> 01:04:19.940\nIs that new?\n\n01:04:19.940 --> 01:04:21.620\nThey didn't have that with murder, she wrote.\n\n01:04:21.620 --> 01:04:23.260\nWell, she didn't need it.\n\n01:04:23.260 --> 01:04:24.540\nShe had mental luminol.\n\n01:04:24.540 --> 01:04:25.380\nIt's true.\n\n01:04:26.380 --> 01:04:28.980\nDid you ever see Angela Lansbury as the Queen of Sheba\n\n01:04:28.980 --> 01:04:29.820\nin like the 60s?\n\n01:04:29.820 --> 01:04:30.660\nShe was hot as F.\n\n01:04:30.660 --> 01:04:31.820\nShe was really hot.\n\n01:04:31.820 --> 01:04:34.260\nShe was beautiful.\n\n01:04:34.260 --> 01:04:35.580\nShe played the Queen of Sheba.\n\n01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:38.500\nWas it like Cleopatra or was it Queen of Sheba?\n\n01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:39.340\nI don't remember.\n\n01:04:39.340 --> 01:04:41.300\nBut I've seen photos of her young\n\n01:04:41.300 --> 01:04:43.300\nand she was really good looking.\n\n01:04:43.300 --> 01:04:44.140\nYeah.\n\n01:04:44.140 --> 01:04:44.980\nYeah.\n\n01:04:44.980 --> 01:04:45.820\nAnyway.\n\n01:04:45.820 --> 01:04:46.780\nI thought you meant like her babies.\n\n01:04:46.780 --> 01:04:47.660\nHer young.\n\n01:04:49.660 --> 01:04:50.500\nYeah.\n\n01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:52.380\nYeah, what are you talking about, you guys?\n\n01:04:52.380 --> 01:04:54.620\nOh shit, you didn't bring your book out here, did you?\n\n01:04:54.620 --> 01:04:55.460\nI did.\n\n01:04:55.460 --> 01:04:56.420\nI didn't bring it, but I got.\n\n01:04:56.420 --> 01:04:58.340\nHer book's in the, in the green room.\n\n01:04:58.340 --> 01:05:01.140\nCause a big, not a big part of your story,\n\n01:05:01.140 --> 01:05:03.060\nbut the recent part of your story.\n\n01:05:03.060 --> 01:05:05.900\nAnd we don't have to talk, it's gotten boring\n\n01:05:05.900 --> 01:05:06.740\nto talk about.\n\n01:05:06.740 --> 01:05:08.060\nHere it is, guys.\n\n01:05:08.060 --> 01:05:09.340\nThat's my book.\n\n01:05:09.340 --> 01:05:12.340\nIt's a New York Times bestseller.\n\n01:05:12.340 --> 01:05:14.660\nSo they can't take that away from me ever.\n\n01:05:14.660 --> 01:05:15.700\nWhich is pretty awesome.\n\n01:05:15.700 --> 01:05:17.300\nWe could talk about Gamergate for an hour\n\n01:05:17.300 --> 01:05:19.340\nand just suck the energy out of the room.\n\n01:05:19.340 --> 01:05:22.540\nWhich I, which I, which I don't think is a fair legacy to,\n\n01:05:22.540 --> 01:05:23.980\nit's 9-11 by the way, yeah.\n\n01:05:27.740 --> 01:05:29.180\nI don't want you to get the wrong impression,\n\n01:05:29.180 --> 01:05:31.300\nbut we just, we get excited about it.\n\n01:05:33.620 --> 01:05:35.620\nBut, but would you mind reading like,\n\n01:05:35.620 --> 01:05:37.260\nyou have, you have passages in your book\n\n01:05:37.260 --> 01:05:40.300\nbecause I think it's funny and also empowering\n\n01:05:40.300 --> 01:05:43.740\nand kind of subversive of the intent of people\n\n01:05:43.740 --> 01:05:46.580\nwho, who, who, who come after people\n\n01:05:46.580 --> 01:05:51.100\nunder the banner of, of, of, of, of, of, of online, like.\n\n01:05:51.100 --> 01:05:53.180\nI mean, I could read the beginning of just that chapter,\n\n01:05:53.180 --> 01:05:55.620\njust about some horrible treats and.\n\n01:05:55.620 --> 01:05:57.700\nYeah. Leading up to the, I thought, oh man,\n\n01:05:57.700 --> 01:06:00.100\nshe should read this out loud cause it's sort of like,\n\n01:06:00.100 --> 01:06:01.860\nbecause I'm listening to you on the audio book\n\n01:06:01.860 --> 01:06:05.020\nand hearing you read the comments that people leave.\n\n01:06:05.020 --> 01:06:07.540\nThe intention being for you to, like,\n\n01:06:07.540 --> 01:06:09.700\nI mean, the way that they speak,\n\n01:06:09.700 --> 01:06:11.780\nyou would think that their intent was for you\n\n01:06:11.780 --> 01:06:15.500\nto just go and hang yourself or quit forever, judge.\n\n01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:17.420\nYou know, it's like, and it's, it is weird.\n\n01:06:17.420 --> 01:06:19.100\nThe internet is such a sewer.\n\n01:06:19.100 --> 01:06:20.700\nAnd then it's so like, like,\n\n01:06:20.700 --> 01:06:24.380\nfor when people get so specific and so targeted,\n\n01:06:24.380 --> 01:06:26.340\nit's like, wait, are you, when I,\n\n01:06:26.340 --> 01:06:28.940\nwhen I heard you reading the stuff out loud,\n\n01:06:28.940 --> 01:06:31.260\nthat I kept thinking like, oh,\n\n01:06:31.260 --> 01:06:32.620\nthis must be their worst nightmare\n\n01:06:32.620 --> 01:06:34.900\nbecause these are their words.\n\n01:06:34.900 --> 01:06:36.780\nAnd they're supposed to like somehow.\n\n01:06:36.780 --> 01:06:38.220\nWell, they have a lot of imager pictures\n\n01:06:38.220 --> 01:06:40.340\nof how it's not completely their words,\n\n01:06:40.340 --> 01:06:41.780\nexcept it's just one tweet.\n\n01:06:41.780 --> 01:06:45.100\nAnd then of course that discredits my whole argument, but.\n\n01:06:45.100 --> 01:06:47.060\nBut there must be what we know of these people.\n\n01:06:47.060 --> 01:06:49.180\nLike I think of it, didn't Orwell have some quote about,\n\n01:06:49.180 --> 01:06:50.460\nif you look at the way people,\n\n01:06:50.460 --> 01:06:51.860\nthe weapons they use to attack people,\n\n01:06:51.860 --> 01:06:53.580\nthen you know everything that scares them.\n\n01:06:53.580 --> 01:06:57.220\nLike it's just almost sort of an uplifting,\n\n01:06:57.220 --> 01:06:59.300\nlike fairy tale irony to it.\n\n01:06:59.300 --> 01:07:01.620\nWhen you see people go after people that hard\n\n01:07:01.620 --> 01:07:03.620\nand viciously cause you know,\n\n01:07:03.620 --> 01:07:05.060\neven though it seems cartoonish,\n\n01:07:05.060 --> 01:07:06.860\nyou know that that means that there's something\n\n01:07:06.860 --> 01:07:09.380\nyou could say to them that would make them cry.\n\n01:07:09.380 --> 01:07:11.580\nYeah, I mean, I've found, I mean,\n\n01:07:11.580 --> 01:07:13.340\nthe funny thing is before that whole incident\n\n01:07:13.340 --> 01:07:15.820\nhappened last year, I had finished my draft in my book\n\n01:07:15.820 --> 01:07:18.700\nand there was a chapter about negative comments,\n\n01:07:18.700 --> 01:07:20.500\nwhich if I, I'll just read just the first part\n\n01:07:20.500 --> 01:07:23.300\nand some of the nasty tweets that are out of context\n\n01:07:23.300 --> 01:07:24.340\nof that incident particularly,\n\n01:07:24.340 --> 01:07:27.300\ncause I'd rather just not give them more coverage.\n\n01:07:27.300 --> 01:07:30.380\nBut, and so the chapter existed\n\n01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:32.740\nabout trying to weather negativity online\n\n01:07:32.740 --> 01:07:35.660\nand how, especially because the roots of that particular\n\n01:07:35.660 --> 01:07:39.100\nincident, that was just a confluence of a bunch of,\n\n01:07:39.100 --> 01:07:42.260\nyou know, basically it was a Chan attack\n\n01:07:42.260 --> 01:07:44.940\nmixed with some conservatism that gave it a label,\n\n01:07:44.940 --> 01:07:46.420\nmixed with men's right, addictivists.\n\n01:07:46.420 --> 01:07:48.420\nAnd it was like a swirling vortex of literally\n\n01:07:48.420 --> 01:07:50.740\nthe worst of everything coming together to me.\n\n01:07:50.740 --> 01:07:52.100\nThat's my perspective.\n\n01:07:52.100 --> 01:07:56.460\nAnd, and so, but the roots of it were sort of a backlash\n\n01:07:56.460 --> 01:07:58.260\nlike we were talking about before of gamer girls.\n\n01:07:58.260 --> 01:08:00.380\nAnd I'm sure we've all seen those memes\n\n01:08:00.380 --> 01:08:02.940\nfrom like three or four years ago of like gamer girls said,\n\n01:08:02.940 --> 01:08:05.220\nand it's this girl with the little chunky glasses\n\n01:08:05.220 --> 01:08:08.860\nlike mine, and it's basically mocking her\n\n01:08:08.860 --> 01:08:10.620\nand saying that essentially that this girl\n\n01:08:10.620 --> 01:08:13.460\nis adopting these things because somehow\n\n01:08:13.460 --> 01:08:16.980\nshe's trying to get attention or be,\n\n01:08:16.980 --> 01:08:19.460\nmake these gamer guys as sexually attracted to her,\n\n01:08:19.460 --> 01:08:20.700\nbut she's really a fake.\n\n01:08:20.700 --> 01:08:23.620\nSo that was really, I think the roots of sort of\n\n01:08:23.620 --> 01:08:26.020\nthis festering thing that built up over the years\n\n01:08:26.020 --> 01:08:28.140\nthat kind of exploded in that incident particular.\n\n01:08:28.140 --> 01:08:31.140\nBut like I've experienced a lot of this in the chapter\n\n01:08:31.140 --> 01:08:33.460\nbefore this even happened.\n\n01:08:33.460 --> 01:08:35.940\nAnd it really, you know, several times\n\n01:08:35.940 --> 01:08:37.500\nI really did want to quit.\n\n01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:39.900\nYou know, I did not want to make videos anymore\n\n01:08:39.900 --> 01:08:42.140\nand I believed them because underneath,\n\n01:08:42.140 --> 01:08:44.060\nif you're an artist, you're kind of insecure.\n\n01:08:44.060 --> 01:08:47.420\nSo when you have that many people on mass get together\n\n01:08:47.420 --> 01:08:50.380\nand say, hey, you're horrible.\n\n01:08:50.380 --> 01:08:53.180\nAnd I'll read, you know, just a little bit at the top.\n\n01:08:53.180 --> 01:08:54.300\nYeah, it's a good time to quit\n\n01:08:54.300 --> 01:08:55.500\nif you're not having a great day.\n\n01:08:55.500 --> 01:08:58.060\nExactly, yeah, exactly.\n\n01:08:58.060 --> 01:08:59.940\nSo I guess I could read just one page\n\n01:08:59.940 --> 01:09:00.940\nor something like that.\n\n01:09:02.620 --> 01:09:04.860\nOkay, I have a folder labeled hate folder.\n\n01:09:04.860 --> 01:09:06.180\nYeah, this is the one.\n\n01:09:06.180 --> 01:09:08.500\nI interrupted you to say.\n\n01:09:08.500 --> 01:09:11.820\nI got it right.\n\n01:09:11.820 --> 01:09:13.620\nGuys, I've nailed it.\n\n01:09:13.620 --> 01:09:15.420\nI have a hate folder labeled hate folder\n\n01:09:15.420 --> 01:09:17.020\nthat sits in the middle of my desktop.\n\n01:09:17.020 --> 01:09:19.140\nIt's where I save screenshots of the worst things\n\n01:09:19.140 --> 01:09:20.540\npeople have said to me online.\n\n01:09:20.540 --> 01:09:22.300\n50 shades of foolishness.\n\n01:09:22.300 --> 01:09:24.020\nFor some reason, it takes the sting away\n\n01:09:24.020 --> 01:09:25.540\nto herd all the toxic comments\n\n01:09:25.540 --> 01:09:27.340\ninto the corner of my hard drive,\n\n01:09:27.340 --> 01:09:29.980\naggregating the losers I'd like to hunt down in real life\n\n01:09:29.980 --> 01:09:32.540\nand run over with a dump truck.\n\n01:09:32.540 --> 01:09:34.420\nThen back up again and run over them again.\n\n01:09:34.420 --> 01:09:35.340\nToo far, huh?\n\n01:09:35.340 --> 01:09:38.340\nOkay, if it's too disgusting to say to another human being,\n\n01:09:38.340 --> 01:09:40.820\nI guarantee that someone has said it to me online.\n\n01:09:40.820 --> 01:09:42.780\nThe internet is amazing because it connects us\n\n01:09:42.780 --> 01:09:44.980\nwith one another, but it's also horrific\n\n01:09:44.980 --> 01:09:48.380\nbecause it connects us with one another.\n\n01:09:48.380 --> 01:09:50.740\nWhether we want the connection or not.\n\n01:09:50.740 --> 01:09:52.740\nThe only real life analogy I can think of\n\n01:09:52.740 --> 01:09:56.060\nis if a random person were to allow to walk into your home,\n\n01:09:56.060 --> 01:09:58.060\npunch you in the face while you're eating your oatmeal,\n\n01:09:58.060 --> 01:10:00.420\nthen walk out again with no fear of consequences.\n\n01:10:00.420 --> 01:10:02.500\nAfter one incident, you'd be looking for a new zip code,\n\n01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:03.580\nwouldn't you?\n\n01:10:03.580 --> 01:10:07.020\nSo here's some fun examples of the human awfulness\n\n01:10:07.020 --> 01:10:08.260\nI've collected over the years.\n\n01:10:08.260 --> 01:10:10.780\nEthely Shaday, a woman using her sexuality\n\n01:10:10.780 --> 01:10:12.580\nto profit from male gamers and pretending\n\n01:10:12.580 --> 01:10:14.180\nshe's empowering women and progressing,\n\n01:10:14.180 --> 01:10:16.460\nquote unquote, gaming culture.\n\n01:10:16.460 --> 01:10:18.820\nHer nose is so fucked up.\n\n01:10:18.820 --> 01:10:21.420\nDid someone hit it with a sledgehammer or what?\n\n01:10:21.420 --> 01:10:22.900\nEthely Shaday, congratulations.\n\n01:10:22.900 --> 01:10:24.460\nYou have a vagina and play video games.\n\n01:10:24.460 --> 01:10:27.020\nNow do something useful.\n\n01:10:27.020 --> 01:10:28.660\nThat's my favorite formula, by the way.\n\n01:10:28.660 --> 01:10:33.500\nIt's like, I don't have a vagina and people tell me I do\n\n01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:35.620\nand it's really no.\n\n01:10:35.620 --> 01:10:38.340\nNo, but like the people, like if I talk about Minecraft\n\n01:10:38.340 --> 01:10:40.220\ntoo much, someone eventually will go,\n\n01:10:40.220 --> 01:10:43.700\nwe get it, you're a celebrity and you do nerdy stuff,\n\n01:10:43.700 --> 01:10:44.700\nget over yourself.\n\n01:10:44.700 --> 01:10:46.620\nI'm like, what in the fucking fuck?\n\n01:10:46.620 --> 01:10:48.340\nToday, somebody called me.\n\n01:10:48.340 --> 01:10:50.780\nYeah, they called me the Kim Kardashian of Nerddom\n\n01:10:50.780 --> 01:10:55.220\nand I'm like, I'm not nearly that successful.\n\n01:10:55.220 --> 01:10:57.140\nBut it's that we get it thing, you\n\n01:10:57.140 --> 01:10:59.140\nshouldn't be allowed to, that doesn't make any sense.\n\n01:10:59.140 --> 01:11:01.340\nLike, hey Steve, we get it, you get a cap on\n\n01:11:01.340 --> 01:11:04.020\nand you're sitting behind a microphone.\n\n01:11:04.020 --> 01:11:09.740\nLike it just sounds like Ben there, done that.\n\n01:11:09.740 --> 01:11:13.180\nOh, we get it, you're lowering your mic.\n\n01:11:13.180 --> 01:11:14.660\nOh, we get it, the cap's back on.\n\n01:11:14.660 --> 01:11:15.900\nWin, I can't win.\n\n01:11:15.900 --> 01:11:18.300\nOh, we get it, you can't win.\n\n01:11:18.300 --> 01:11:19.340\nIt's not fair.\n\n01:11:19.340 --> 01:11:21.620\nIt's like the Agent Orange of criticism.\n\n01:11:21.620 --> 01:11:23.700\nWell, it's almost like people who are probably\n\n01:11:23.700 --> 01:11:25.980\nshamed for what they love, trying to shame somebody else\n\n01:11:25.980 --> 01:11:27.660\nfor those exact same things.\n\n01:11:27.660 --> 01:11:31.460\nIt's a little bit unproductively and ironic,\n\n01:11:31.460 --> 01:11:33.620\nbut in her fault, it really is her fault\n\n01:11:33.620 --> 01:11:36.420\nbecause I think at the end of the day,\n\n01:11:36.420 --> 01:11:39.100\nlike I am who I am because I was rejected a lot\n\n01:11:39.100 --> 01:11:41.220\nand I never felt like I belonged anywhere.\n\n01:11:41.220 --> 01:11:44.540\nAnd now that I have been able to break out of that\n\n01:11:44.540 --> 01:11:47.060\nand show people that it's acceptable and be,\n\n01:11:47.060 --> 01:11:49.460\nI guess, more mainstream or more visible,\n\n01:11:49.460 --> 01:11:52.260\nthen I have people telling me that, hey,\n\n01:11:52.260 --> 01:11:53.940\nyou're just a sellout and you're pandering\n\n01:11:53.940 --> 01:11:55.060\nand you don't believe any of this\n\n01:11:55.060 --> 01:11:59.180\nor you're useless and your nose, let's see.\n\n01:11:59.180 --> 01:12:00.860\nIf you honestly think Felicia Day worked hard\n\n01:12:00.860 --> 01:12:03.220\nto get where she is, eat a bowl of fucking nails.\n\n01:12:03.220 --> 01:12:08.380\nThat's not even the worst ultimatum.\n\n01:12:08.380 --> 01:12:10.900\nIt really is, eating nails.\n\n01:12:10.900 --> 01:12:13.180\nEat a bowl, oh, fine.\n\n01:12:13.180 --> 01:12:16.540\nI mean, I'll get by.\n\n01:12:16.540 --> 01:12:19.540\nIt's not like, yeah.\n\n01:12:19.540 --> 01:12:21.260\nSorry, everybody.\n\n01:12:21.260 --> 01:12:22.260\nHe's bad at insults.\n\n01:12:22.260 --> 01:12:23.780\nSpencer grew up on a farm and he has one\n\n01:12:23.780 --> 01:12:26.020\nof those cylindrical super magnets in his stomach.\n\n01:12:26.020 --> 01:12:27.340\nOh, really?\n\n01:12:27.340 --> 01:12:30.580\nBecause he grazes by the fence posts.\n\n01:12:30.580 --> 01:12:32.740\nHe eats a lot of nails.\n\n01:12:32.740 --> 01:12:35.060\nIt's just a fact of life in CME Valley.\n\n01:12:35.060 --> 01:12:36.420\nAnd I get through it.\n\n01:12:36.420 --> 01:12:39.180\nSo he thinks everyone has a magnet in their stomach\n\n01:12:39.180 --> 01:12:40.180\nthat lets them eat nails.\n\n01:12:40.180 --> 01:12:41.740\nWell, anybody could.\n\n01:12:41.740 --> 01:12:43.980\nThat's what counts.\n\n01:12:43.980 --> 01:12:44.820\nThat's all I'm saying.\n\n01:12:44.820 --> 01:12:45.740\nI have a lot of thoughts.\n\n01:12:45.740 --> 01:12:47.260\nConspiracy websites?\n\n01:12:47.260 --> 01:12:47.860\nI really don't.\n\n01:12:47.860 --> 01:12:50.580\nI didn't even, earlier, a couple episodes ago,\n\n01:12:50.580 --> 01:12:52.580\nwe asked if I had any conspiracy theories.\n\n01:12:52.580 --> 01:12:53.540\nAnd I was like, nope.\n\n01:12:53.540 --> 01:12:56.060\nBut apparently, I have one.\n\n01:12:56.060 --> 01:12:57.420\nMichael Hastings.\n\n01:12:57.420 --> 01:12:59.820\nNo, no, I think most conspiracies are kind of,\n\n01:12:59.820 --> 01:13:03.620\nyou know, they, well, everyone knows about conspiracies.\n\n01:13:03.620 --> 01:13:06.180\nThey work backward from the result they want to achieve.\n\n01:13:06.180 --> 01:13:07.380\nYeah.\n\n01:13:07.380 --> 01:13:08.460\nDo you want me to read more of this?\n\n01:13:08.460 --> 01:13:10.260\nYeah, I think there's a C word coming, right?\n\n01:13:10.260 --> 01:13:10.740\nOh, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:13:10.740 --> 01:13:11.660\nYou want me to read more of them?\n\n01:13:11.660 --> 01:13:14.460\nAre you going to give me to say this word on, OK, I got.\n\n01:13:14.460 --> 01:13:17.980\nWhy do gamer girls always use the term nerdy geek and gamer?\n\n01:13:17.980 --> 01:13:19.700\nCan't Felicia Day just shut the fuck up?\n\n01:13:19.700 --> 01:13:21.100\nShe's nothing but an attention whore\n\n01:13:21.100 --> 01:13:24.060\nthat uses her gender as a key for attention.\n\n01:13:24.060 --> 01:13:25.340\nTell me, would you have subscribed\n\n01:13:25.340 --> 01:13:27.220\nto this channel if Felicia Day wasn't a girl?\n\n01:13:27.220 --> 01:13:30.700\nIf you say yes, you're a fucking idiot.\n\n01:13:30.700 --> 01:13:32.980\nSomeone tell that red-headed cunt that the kitchen's\n\n01:13:32.980 --> 01:13:34.660\ndown the hall and not front of the camera.\n\n01:13:37.180 --> 01:13:38.540\nAll right.\n\n01:13:38.540 --> 01:13:43.700\nThat's like a 16-year-old using, like,\n\n01:13:43.700 --> 01:13:48.140\n1960s cat skill comedy that he would, if his dad said that,\n\n01:13:48.140 --> 01:13:50.780\nhe'd be like, dad.\n\n01:13:50.780 --> 01:13:51.980\nIt'd be like Father Knows Best.\n\n01:13:51.980 --> 01:13:55.900\nYou could see, like, Frank, what is that guy's name?\n\n01:13:55.900 --> 01:13:56.540\nFred Murray?\n\n01:13:56.540 --> 01:13:57.460\nI hate him.\n\n01:13:57.460 --> 01:13:58.260\nHe's dead, right?\n\n01:13:58.260 --> 01:13:59.500\nThat's my three sons.\n\n01:13:59.500 --> 01:14:00.620\nFred McMurray?\n\n01:14:00.620 --> 01:14:01.620\nFred McMurray.\n\n01:14:01.620 --> 01:14:05.260\nFather Knows Best was Robert Young.\n\n01:14:05.260 --> 01:14:06.460\nRobert Young.\n\n01:14:06.460 --> 01:14:07.180\nOK.\n\n01:14:07.180 --> 01:14:08.460\nNo, that's Freddie Krueger.\n\n01:14:08.460 --> 01:14:11.500\nDid you know that Fred McMurray never\n\n01:14:11.500 --> 01:14:13.580\nwas in the same room with those children, though?\n\n01:14:13.580 --> 01:14:15.180\nLike, he would shoot all of his sons?\n\n01:14:15.180 --> 01:14:17.780\nYes, he would shoot all of his scenes in advance,\n\n01:14:17.780 --> 01:14:19.740\nlike, in a separate unit.\n\n01:14:19.740 --> 01:14:22.020\nAnd then it would be a double with most of the things.\n\n01:14:22.020 --> 01:14:23.300\nHe'd come in and do a couple.\n\n01:14:23.300 --> 01:14:26.260\nNo, I think that was William Frawley, who was also in the show.\n\n01:14:26.260 --> 01:14:27.020\nBut he.\n\n01:14:27.020 --> 01:14:28.100\nOh, it was William Frawley?\n\n01:14:28.100 --> 01:14:29.020\nYeah.\n\n01:14:29.020 --> 01:14:29.940\nWhy did he do it?\n\n01:14:29.940 --> 01:14:31.220\nDid he hate children?\n\n01:14:31.220 --> 01:14:34.180\nHe just didn't want to do the show.\n\n01:14:34.180 --> 01:14:36.020\nHe would, yeah, he would shoot all his stuff out\n\n01:14:36.020 --> 01:14:37.940\nin, like, you know, like a couple days,\n\n01:14:37.940 --> 01:14:39.820\nand they would just fake it.\n\n01:14:39.820 --> 01:14:40.380\nAll right.\n\n01:14:40.380 --> 01:14:43.140\nWell, let's spread another rumor that's not true, Felicia.\n\n01:14:43.140 --> 01:14:45.380\nAbout 50s dead people.\n\n01:14:45.380 --> 01:14:46.940\nCan you just pick to do that?\n\n01:14:46.940 --> 01:14:49.620\nYou're like, eh, fuck all these other actors.\n\n01:14:49.620 --> 01:14:52.100\nI'll just put me in a box and I'll do two days.\n\n01:14:52.100 --> 01:14:53.700\nDidn't that happen on The Good Wives, though?\n\n01:14:53.700 --> 01:14:54.260\nThe Good Wives?\n\n01:14:54.260 --> 01:14:56.020\nShe's CGI'd the last scene of Collindo?\n\n01:14:56.020 --> 01:14:57.460\nOh, yeah, I heard about that.\n\n01:14:57.460 --> 01:14:57.960\nYeah.\n\n01:14:57.960 --> 01:15:00.140\nThose monsters.\n\n01:15:00.140 --> 01:15:03.340\nNot the women, the CGI'ers.\n\n01:15:03.340 --> 01:15:05.620\nAnyway, CGI'ers?\n\n01:15:05.620 --> 01:15:07.220\nDo you want me to read more?\n\n01:15:07.220 --> 01:15:09.060\nI don't know if you have any favorites.\n\n01:15:09.060 --> 01:15:11.580\nNo, I feel like I'm putting you through those meat grinders\n\n01:15:11.580 --> 01:15:12.080\nnow.\n\n01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:12.900\nNo, I totally read.\n\n01:15:12.900 --> 01:15:15.060\nI mean, essentially, the rest of it is, you know.\n\n01:15:15.060 --> 01:15:16.780\nOh, no, I mean, yeah, I mean, it's, it's.\n\n01:15:16.780 --> 01:15:18.380\nThey were the good, the good one is the tweets.\n\n01:15:18.380 --> 01:15:20.780\nLike, I, you know, I'll see something like that every day,\n\n01:15:20.780 --> 01:15:22.980\nbut then I'll see hundreds of more positive comments.\n\n01:15:22.980 --> 01:15:25.060\nAnd you know, the cool thing is that I just went on book tour\n\n01:15:25.060 --> 01:15:27.140\nand I went to 13 cities and, you know,\n\n01:15:27.140 --> 01:15:30.940\ngoing out in the world is strange to me.\n\n01:15:30.940 --> 01:15:34.260\nBut the coolest thing was there were so many guys who came up\n\n01:15:34.260 --> 01:15:35.540\nand bought the book and they were like,\n\n01:15:35.540 --> 01:15:37.820\nI'm buying this for my niece who's 13,\n\n01:15:37.820 --> 01:15:39.820\nor I'm buying this for my daughter who's 16.\n\n01:15:39.820 --> 01:15:42.820\nAnd I just love the idea that there were these fathers\n\n01:15:42.820 --> 01:15:46.260\nand, and guys who were, who didn't really know what to do\n\n01:15:46.260 --> 01:15:49.060\nfor these girls who were at this age that you probably\n\n01:15:49.060 --> 01:15:51.020\nwould abandon the cool things that you might love,\n\n01:15:51.020 --> 01:15:53.180\nlike, you know, gaming or anything,\n\n01:15:53.180 --> 01:15:57.460\nanything that made them feel less popular or likable,\n\n01:15:57.460 --> 01:15:59.820\nthat they wanted to give them any tool that they could find\n\n01:15:59.820 --> 01:16:01.380\nto be as who they are.\n\n01:16:01.380 --> 01:16:03.100\nAnd I think that was the coolest thing that I learned.\n\n01:16:03.100 --> 01:16:05.900\nTeresa thinks to the way they were in 1983 when it was like,\n\n01:16:05.900 --> 01:16:09.100\nlook, we're too nerdy to be caring about something\n\n01:16:09.100 --> 01:16:13.100\nthat our, like, our World War II, like, like,\n\n01:16:13.100 --> 01:16:14.780\nnow I'm denigrating vets.\n\n01:16:14.780 --> 01:16:18.220\nWe've got Tejano stars and vets.\n\n01:16:18.220 --> 01:16:19.060\nI've got Nick Harmon down,\n\n01:16:19.060 --> 01:16:20.900\nand a bunch of guys come up with like the caps\n\n01:16:20.900 --> 01:16:22.860\nand they're just like, why, and they're like,\n\n01:16:22.860 --> 01:16:24.500\nand they're like, why did you say that?\n\n01:16:24.500 --> 01:16:25.340\nYou're terrible.\n\n01:16:25.340 --> 01:16:27.020\nWe fought for your country.\n\n01:16:27.020 --> 01:16:29.260\nNo, but I was, I'm just saying like that, that era,\n\n01:16:29.260 --> 01:16:31.420\nit's like, why are these like, like, we're dead,\n\n01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:33.940\nwe can't possibly, our nerds that successful now\n\n01:16:33.940 --> 01:16:37.140\nthat we're able to like split down into like camps.\n\n01:16:37.140 --> 01:16:37.980\nAnd I don't think so.\n\n01:16:37.980 --> 01:16:39.780\nI think these are people that are having a bad day\n\n01:16:39.780 --> 01:16:40.860\nor something and they're like,\n\n01:16:40.860 --> 01:16:42.580\nbecause it seems like from what they're saying,\n\n01:16:42.580 --> 01:16:46.340\nit's just almost like comedically over targeted.\n\n01:16:46.340 --> 01:16:48.540\nLike to me, one of the worst things I hear\n\n01:16:48.540 --> 01:16:51.180\nare when people are like, you know, it's the whole math thing.\n\n01:16:51.180 --> 01:16:53.620\nIt's like, like, that's, it's like, well, who cares?\n\n01:16:53.620 --> 01:16:55.380\nLike, fuck you, I'm bored with you or what?\n\n01:16:55.380 --> 01:16:57.500\nYou know, if you really, if you really,\n\n01:16:57.500 --> 01:16:59.700\nreally, really do dislike somebody,\n\n01:16:59.700 --> 01:17:02.380\nwell, I always say like the opposite of love isn't,\n\n01:17:02.380 --> 01:17:03.380\nhate, it's apathy.\n\n01:17:03.380 --> 01:17:07.780\nLike it's the silence that hurts people like us\n\n01:17:07.780 --> 01:17:09.660\nmore than the attention.\n\n01:17:09.660 --> 01:17:12.180\nAnd it's the, I mean, when you, when you like come\n\n01:17:12.180 --> 01:17:15.180\nafter somebody, I just think, I think that it's so,\n\n01:17:15.180 --> 01:17:17.700\nit's so, the thing that's really weird about it is\n\n01:17:17.700 --> 01:17:20.820\nbecause I have a 15 year old misogynistic little prick\n\n01:17:20.820 --> 01:17:21.900\ninside of me.\n\n01:17:21.900 --> 01:17:23.020\nI can access it.\n\n01:17:23.020 --> 01:17:25.020\nAnd I have one of the trunk of my car too.\n\n01:17:25.020 --> 01:17:29.220\nI have jars of them in my basement.\n\n01:17:29.220 --> 01:17:34.220\nBut like, I can run that simulator.\n\n01:17:35.220 --> 01:17:37.140\nIt's not that, it's not like the circuitry\n\n01:17:37.140 --> 01:17:40.540\nisn't able to go down there with a couple of switch flips.\n\n01:17:40.540 --> 01:17:42.460\nAnd, and when I run that simulation,\n\n01:17:42.460 --> 01:17:46.060\nI'm like, like the thing that outrages me is like,\n\n01:17:46.060 --> 01:17:49.140\nwhy is everybody trying to make something that's like mine\n\n01:17:49.140 --> 01:17:51.500\nand personal and fucking awesome.\n\n01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:53.100\nAnd it's all about being radical\n\n01:17:53.100 --> 01:17:54.420\nand honeycomb hat out.\n\n01:17:56.420 --> 01:17:59.300\nLike, like, like, what is all this bullshit talk\n\n01:17:59.300 --> 01:18:02.180\nabout apologizing and backpedaling and sensitivity\n\n01:18:02.180 --> 01:18:03.020\nand all this shit.\n\n01:18:03.020 --> 01:18:04.380\nIt's like, it's just like, like, like,\n\n01:18:04.380 --> 01:18:07.300\nand it's, the weird thing is no one,\n\n01:18:07.300 --> 01:18:09.300\nno one had to be doing that until,\n\n01:18:09.300 --> 01:18:11.740\nand it's just like this weird syndrome of,\n\n01:18:11.740 --> 01:18:14.060\nokay, the culture grew to the point where,\n\n01:18:14.060 --> 01:18:17.940\nokay, there's points of overlap where somebody says something\n\n01:18:17.940 --> 01:18:19.300\nand then somebody reacts in a weird way.\n\n01:18:19.300 --> 01:18:22.900\nAnd then it requires like the talk about sensitivity.\n\n01:18:22.900 --> 01:18:24.100\nIt requires all that stuff.\n\n01:18:24.100 --> 01:18:26.220\nIt's like, you ruined it, you know?\n\n01:18:26.220 --> 01:18:29.220\nLike, like, like the person who has that complaint.\n\n01:18:29.220 --> 01:18:32.260\nIt's like, it's like, you, now it's necessary\n\n01:18:32.260 --> 01:18:34.860\nfor somebody who wants their niece to grow up\n\n01:18:34.860 --> 01:18:38.380\nin a, you know, in an environment where she can flourish.\n\n01:18:38.380 --> 01:18:41.500\nThey have the responsibility on them to do things\n\n01:18:41.500 --> 01:18:44.740\nlike stand behind you publicly if you get doxxed\n\n01:18:44.740 --> 01:18:47.100\nor whatever and say like, this is fucked up\n\n01:18:47.100 --> 01:18:48.100\nand you guys are fucked up\n\n01:18:48.100 --> 01:18:50.460\nand fuck you Adam Baldwin and whatever.\n\n01:18:50.460 --> 01:18:51.700\nLike, like, let's do it.\n\n01:18:51.700 --> 01:18:52.900\nI got you, I got you.\n\n01:18:52.900 --> 01:18:53.780\nI got your back.\n\n01:18:57.420 --> 01:19:00.620\nBecause if you don't, now you're like not.\n\n01:19:00.620 --> 01:19:02.860\nIt just pisses me off because I'm always the kind of person\n\n01:19:02.860 --> 01:19:05.620\nwho I like to be genderless in a sense that I am,\n\n01:19:05.620 --> 01:19:08.100\nI'm not putting, you know, a gender,\n\n01:19:08.100 --> 01:19:09.980\nlike amending girl game.\n\n01:19:09.980 --> 01:19:11.940\nLike that's not something that I need to do\n\n01:19:11.940 --> 01:19:16.220\nbecause that essentially gives gamer the default to guys,\n\n01:19:16.220 --> 01:19:17.060\nright?\n\n01:19:17.060 --> 01:19:17.980\nSo that's just the way I think.\n\n01:19:17.980 --> 01:19:21.260\nI don't, but what kind of enrages me is that\n\n01:19:21.260 --> 01:19:22.980\nthere is an increasing need for women\n\n01:19:22.980 --> 01:19:24.700\nto have their own esports league\n\n01:19:24.700 --> 01:19:27.180\nor women to have their own thing in order to be,\n\n01:19:27.180 --> 01:19:29.540\nand they've shown studies that makes women more confident\n\n01:19:29.540 --> 01:19:32.580\nto participate in things that are not traditionally\n\n01:19:32.580 --> 01:19:35.580\nfemale-driven, which I'm like, no, just get up there.\n\n01:19:35.580 --> 01:19:38.220\nBe one of the guy, you know, be there and be equal\n\n01:19:38.220 --> 01:19:40.820\nand be represented as a person.\n\n01:19:40.820 --> 01:19:42.500\nBut there is this need on the internet,\n\n01:19:42.500 --> 01:19:44.380\nespecially when you're in little ecosystems\n\n01:19:44.380 --> 01:19:46.180\nto call people other, you know.\n\n01:19:46.180 --> 01:19:47.780\nOh, you're other, your race is different,\n\n01:19:47.780 --> 01:19:50.580\nyour sexuality is different, your gender is different,\n\n01:19:50.580 --> 01:19:52.500\nand you should be ashamed of the differences.\n\n01:19:52.500 --> 01:19:55.260\nThat is essentially where the kind of power,\n\n01:19:55.260 --> 01:19:58.580\nI guess, is motivated because there are different kinds\n\n01:19:58.580 --> 01:20:00.340\nof people coming into these worlds\n\n01:20:00.340 --> 01:20:01.180\nwith different opinions.\n\n01:20:01.180 --> 01:20:02.020\nAnd then you have people saying,\n\n01:20:02.020 --> 01:20:02.900\nwe should be hypersensitive to the differences,\n\n01:20:02.900 --> 01:20:04.540\nand then you have other people going like,\n\n01:20:04.540 --> 01:20:06.940\nI'm hypersensitive to the idea of hypersensitivity.\n\n01:20:06.940 --> 01:20:07.780\nWell, yes.\n\n01:20:07.780 --> 01:20:09.580\nAnd then it's just like round and fucking round.\n\n01:20:09.580 --> 01:20:11.220\nWe go because it's when the, it's when the,\n\n01:20:11.220 --> 01:20:14.900\nit's when the frustrated like, like semi-moderate people\n\n01:20:14.900 --> 01:20:17.940\nwho had nothing but suppressable rage\n\n01:20:17.940 --> 01:20:19.700\nthat could have, could have remained suppressed\n\n01:20:19.700 --> 01:20:22.060\nuntil they were 40, but they're, you know,\n\n01:20:22.060 --> 01:20:23.580\nit's coming out because they're like,\n\n01:20:23.580 --> 01:20:25.180\nthey're being asked to pick a side\n\n01:20:25.180 --> 01:20:27.220\nand an issue that doesn't have to be an issue.\n\n01:20:27.220 --> 01:20:30.580\nLike the whole every, it's almost like everyone is agreeing\n\n01:20:30.580 --> 01:20:32.260\nthat we don't want to live in a world\n\n01:20:32.260 --> 01:20:34.500\nwhere we have to have the fucking conversation 24 hours a day.\n\n01:20:34.500 --> 01:20:36.820\nWell, that was the whole thing I wrote a blog post about,\n\n01:20:36.820 --> 01:20:39.300\nyou know, it was the kind of an essay\n\n01:20:39.300 --> 01:20:41.380\nabout how at the height of Gamergate,\n\n01:20:41.380 --> 01:20:44.260\nlike we need to stop doing this and we all love gaming\n\n01:20:44.260 --> 01:20:46.300\nand we need to show a positive face.\n\n01:20:46.300 --> 01:20:47.580\nAnd when I saw, you know,\n\n01:20:47.580 --> 01:20:49.300\nbecause of so much hatred that I was getting,\n\n01:20:49.300 --> 01:20:51.740\nI was like, you know, I saw some guys in some gamer shirts\n\n01:20:51.740 --> 01:20:53.820\nand I would assume that we would have been like, yeah,\n\n01:20:53.820 --> 01:20:54.660\nhigh five.\n\n01:20:54.660 --> 01:20:55.500\nAnd then I was just like,\n\n01:20:55.500 --> 01:20:56.340\nI don't want to deal with it.\n\n01:20:56.340 --> 01:20:57.900\nI don't want to treat, you know, just kind of,\n\n01:20:57.900 --> 01:20:59.220\nand it was almost unconscious.\n\n01:20:59.220 --> 01:21:01.740\nAnd I realized because people were really attacking me\n\n01:21:01.740 --> 01:21:03.900\nand shaming me and that these,\n\n01:21:03.900 --> 01:21:06.500\nthose kind of comments were like 20 times, you know,\n\n01:21:06.500 --> 01:21:08.180\nat the height of that incident,\n\n01:21:08.180 --> 01:21:11.460\nI was subconsciously changing my behavior based on\n\n01:21:11.460 --> 01:21:14.060\nsomeone basically fucking up what I love,\n\n01:21:14.060 --> 01:21:15.860\na culture that I love and something that I love.\n\n01:21:15.860 --> 01:21:17.980\nAnd I've always wanted to spread the love of\n\n01:21:17.980 --> 01:21:19.580\nand show people, hey, gaming,\n\n01:21:19.580 --> 01:21:21.220\nI mean, I spent the most time rewriting\n\n01:21:21.220 --> 01:21:22.380\nthe real world of Warcraft thing\n\n01:21:22.380 --> 01:21:24.380\nbecause I really wanted to show people how awesome\n\n01:21:24.380 --> 01:21:25.780\nit was to play MMOs\n\n01:21:25.780 --> 01:21:28.380\nand how fun it could be and somebody aunt could read it\n\n01:21:28.380 --> 01:21:29.860\nand understand why their, you know,\n\n01:21:29.860 --> 01:21:31.580\nnephew would like these kinds of things.\n\n01:21:31.580 --> 01:21:34.100\nSo during that, that's why I wrote that essay,\n\n01:21:34.100 --> 01:21:36.900\nwhich led to people posting my address online\n\n01:21:36.900 --> 01:21:38.860\nand a lot of people now just saying,\n\n01:21:38.860 --> 01:21:40.100\nI'm afraid of gamers,\n\n01:21:40.100 --> 01:21:42.580\nwhich is like literally the opposite of what I said,\n\n01:21:42.580 --> 01:21:43.420\nfactually.\n\n01:21:43.420 --> 01:21:44.740\nRight, and your thesis wasn't even,\n\n01:21:44.740 --> 01:21:46.020\nthis is another misunderstanding.\n\n01:21:46.020 --> 01:21:48.660\nWhen people talk about these subjective experiences,\n\n01:21:48.660 --> 01:21:52.380\nthey're not saying this thing happened to me\n\n01:21:52.380 --> 01:21:54.740\nthat is a crime that needs to be punished.\n\n01:21:54.740 --> 01:21:56.460\nThey're saying this is the experience\n\n01:21:56.460 --> 01:21:58.780\nthat is happening to me subjectively.\n\n01:21:58.780 --> 01:22:02.020\nAnd I, you know, I am a big fat,\n\n01:22:02.020 --> 01:22:05.460\nstraight white bearded male at a middle age\n\n01:22:05.460 --> 01:22:07.860\nthat has never had anything but good fortune,\n\n01:22:07.860 --> 01:22:10.100\nbut being in the spotlight,\n\n01:22:10.100 --> 01:22:12.180\nit's nothing to complain about,\n\n01:22:12.180 --> 01:22:14.100\neven the negative parts of it,\n\n01:22:14.100 --> 01:22:17.460\nbut it is, when, you know,\n\n01:22:17.460 --> 01:22:21.060\nwhen you've run afoul of the public\n\n01:22:21.060 --> 01:22:24.220\nand people are tweeting at you around the clock,\n\n01:22:24.220 --> 01:22:25.420\nyou should kill yourself.\n\n01:22:25.420 --> 01:22:26.420\nNo one likes you.\n\n01:22:26.420 --> 01:22:28.300\nWhy the fuck are you in my newspaper?\n\n01:22:28.300 --> 01:22:30.260\nYou dumb piece of shit.\n\n01:22:30.260 --> 01:22:31.340\nThe guy was fletched.\n\n01:22:31.340 --> 01:22:32.740\nWhy are you doing this?\n\n01:22:34.020 --> 01:22:35.060\nLike, like, like, like,\n\n01:22:35.060 --> 01:22:37.540\nand it's just like, it erodes at your psyche\n\n01:22:37.540 --> 01:22:39.700\nand there's nothing to, I deserved it,\n\n01:22:39.700 --> 01:22:43.900\nlike, but it's important to note like how much,\n\n01:22:43.900 --> 01:22:45.940\nit freaks you the fuck out.\n\n01:22:45.940 --> 01:22:49.100\nSo if you do happen to be like me,\n\n01:22:49.100 --> 01:22:53.060\nbut have a vagina and have people that have wieners,\n\n01:22:53.060 --> 01:22:55.420\nlike saying, like, like adding that edge to it\n\n01:22:55.420 --> 01:22:57.020\nwhere they're like, I know where you live,\n\n01:22:57.020 --> 01:22:58.180\nI'm gonna fucking kill you.\n\n01:22:58.180 --> 01:23:00.940\nI had somebody yesterday, like, at a convention\n\n01:23:00.940 --> 01:23:03.220\nand this guy came up and it was like,\n\n01:23:03.220 --> 01:23:05.860\nI love the furniture in your house.\n\n01:23:05.860 --> 01:23:08.740\nAnd like, and at the time, you know, you're signing,\n\n01:23:08.740 --> 01:23:09.900\nI'm signing hundreds of autographs.\n\n01:23:09.900 --> 01:23:11.620\nI'm like, oh, you know, that makes me uncomfortable.\n\n01:23:11.620 --> 01:23:13.260\nAnd I'm like, and I sign it and I go away.\n\n01:23:13.260 --> 01:23:16.580\nAnd then I looked at that guy, the handler with me,\n\n01:23:16.580 --> 01:23:18.100\nI was like, did you just really say that?\n\n01:23:18.100 --> 01:23:21.420\nAnd then I'm like, okay, A, he's trying to freak me out\n\n01:23:21.420 --> 01:23:23.100\nbecause he's trying to use the power, you know,\n\n01:23:23.100 --> 01:23:26.420\njust either he's a troll and he's like, look what I did guys.\n\n01:23:26.420 --> 01:23:29.420\nI went up and, you know, said this or, you know,\n\n01:23:29.420 --> 01:23:31.900\nthere's a possibility like, could somebody have a camera?\n\n01:23:31.900 --> 01:23:33.660\nLike, it has to go through my mind\n\n01:23:33.660 --> 01:23:35.580\nbecause I've literally had people in my house.\n\n01:23:35.580 --> 01:23:37.780\nI have restraining orders against people who are,\n\n01:23:37.780 --> 01:23:40.500\nyou know, have taken it so far and to imply that\n\n01:23:40.500 --> 01:23:42.780\nthose kind of threats aren't as, you know,\n\n01:23:42.780 --> 01:23:45.660\nemotionally damaging and also potentially threatful,\n\n01:23:45.660 --> 01:23:48.140\nespecially if you're in a public forum\n\n01:23:48.140 --> 01:23:49.900\nand even the internet can find where you live.\n\n01:23:49.900 --> 01:23:51.580\nLike, this is a real thing.\n\n01:23:51.580 --> 01:23:52.780\nThere's been actual dudes in your house.\n\n01:23:52.780 --> 01:23:54.620\nYeah, there has been a person, yes.\n\n01:23:54.620 --> 01:23:55.980\nThat's not the thing that you're,\n\n01:23:55.980 --> 01:23:57.460\nwhen you write that blog entry,\n\n01:23:57.460 --> 01:23:58.820\nyou're, that's not what you're taught.\n\n01:23:58.820 --> 01:24:00.500\nYou don't, you don't lead with that.\n\n01:24:00.500 --> 01:24:02.100\nThat's not the bad you're wearing.\n\n01:24:02.100 --> 01:24:03.540\nIt's not about crimes committed\n\n01:24:03.540 --> 01:24:04.980\nand recompense needing to be done.\n\n01:24:04.980 --> 01:24:07.420\nYou're saying that in that, in that blog entry,\n\n01:24:07.420 --> 01:24:09.620\nyou're going, how did this fucking happen to our culture?\n\n01:24:09.620 --> 01:24:11.660\nYeah, everybody needs to stop being hateful\n\n01:24:11.660 --> 01:24:13.780\nbecause you're making gamers look like assholes.\n\n01:24:13.780 --> 01:24:15.900\nLike that's what, the point of that was,\n\n01:24:15.900 --> 01:24:18.260\nand especially from a point of like,\n\n01:24:18.260 --> 01:24:20.180\nwe all love this together.\n\n01:24:20.180 --> 01:24:22.860\nLet's figure it out and agree to disagree with respect\n\n01:24:22.860 --> 01:24:25.140\nbecause it just got to the point where it was crazy.\n\n01:24:25.140 --> 01:24:27.780\nAnd thank goodness a lot of people have spoken up,\n\n01:24:27.780 --> 01:24:30.060\nespecially leaders in gaming\n\n01:24:30.060 --> 01:24:32.540\nand like gaming companies are taking it seriously.\n\n01:24:32.540 --> 01:24:34.660\nAnd it just like, to me, I love it.\n\n01:24:34.660 --> 01:24:37.340\nAnd I want people to know that gaming is amazing.\n\n01:24:37.340 --> 01:24:40.300\nAnd, you know, that really is a future of our entertainment\n\n01:24:40.300 --> 01:24:41.140\nis gaming.\n\n01:24:41.140 --> 01:24:42.380\nI just went to this thing called The Void\n\n01:24:42.380 --> 01:24:44.780\nand literally I put on some onoculus and a backpack\n\n01:24:44.780 --> 01:24:46.660\nand I ran through a maze\n\n01:24:46.660 --> 01:24:48.660\nand I thought I was in like a sky room.\n\n01:24:48.660 --> 01:24:49.500\nI'm not kidding.\n\n01:24:49.500 --> 01:24:50.340\nLook up The Void.\n\n01:24:50.340 --> 01:24:52.180\nIt really, I did it in person.\n\n01:24:52.180 --> 01:24:54.580\nIt might be the most amazing thing I've ever experienced.\n\n01:24:54.580 --> 01:24:57.260\nAnd I realized we are going to be living in all of worlds\n\n01:24:57.260 --> 01:24:58.900\nthat intersect with nobody else's\n\n01:24:58.900 --> 01:25:01.740\nor we will be adventuring truly in the worlds\n\n01:25:01.740 --> 01:25:04.460\nthat we want to escape to now, just in passive fiction.\n\n01:25:04.460 --> 01:25:06.580\nAnd in 20 years, it's going to be crazy.\n\n01:25:06.580 --> 01:25:08.660\nHave you put on the valve thing?\n\n01:25:08.660 --> 01:25:10.460\nThe valve thing is nothing compared to this\n\n01:25:10.460 --> 01:25:12.380\nbecause I was actively running through.\n\n01:25:13.660 --> 01:25:14.860\nI'm not, I'm not kidding.\n\n01:25:14.860 --> 01:25:18.820\nOkay, well, I've died, the valve is the top\n\n01:25:18.820 --> 01:25:20.060\nthat I've experienced so far.\n\n01:25:20.060 --> 01:25:20.900\nJust look up The Void.\n\n01:25:20.900 --> 01:25:21.740\nWhat's this thing called?\n\n01:25:21.740 --> 01:25:22.580\nIt's called The Void.\n\n01:25:22.580 --> 01:25:23.420\nWhat are those treadmills?\n\n01:25:23.420 --> 01:25:24.260\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:25:24.260 --> 01:25:26.060\nIt's a literal, no, it's like,\n\n01:25:26.060 --> 01:25:27.180\nit's like a paintball arena.\n\n01:25:27.180 --> 01:25:28.020\nThis guy knows.\n\n01:25:28.020 --> 01:25:28.860\nJust look up The Void.\n\n01:25:28.860 --> 01:25:30.420\nIt's like, it got three million views on it.\n\n01:25:30.420 --> 01:25:33.060\nWait, is it AR or VR or a TR?\n\n01:25:33.060 --> 01:25:33.900\nIt's VR.\n\n01:25:33.900 --> 01:25:35.340\nIt's like a holodeck.\n\n01:25:35.340 --> 01:25:37.660\nSo you have an oculus on, which is not,\n\n01:25:37.660 --> 01:25:39.380\nit's not, it's like a customized oculus\n\n01:25:39.380 --> 01:25:41.020\nand a backpack, basically.\n\n01:25:41.020 --> 01:25:42.860\nAnd you put it on and you turn it on\n\n01:25:42.860 --> 01:25:44.180\nand you literally step through a portal\n\n01:25:44.180 --> 01:25:46.660\nand you're in an Indiana Jones ruins\n\n01:25:46.660 --> 01:25:48.260\nor you're on a spaceship and it feels,\n\n01:25:48.260 --> 01:25:49.100\nand you're shooting.\n\n01:25:49.100 --> 01:25:51.100\nIt's not hard to stand up.\n\n01:25:51.100 --> 01:25:51.940\nNo.\n\n01:25:51.940 --> 01:25:53.700\nI noticed the first time I tried oculus rift\n\n01:25:53.700 --> 01:25:54.780\nwhen it first came out,\n\n01:25:54.780 --> 01:25:56.620\nit would make me really nauseous a lot of time.\n\n01:25:56.620 --> 01:25:57.460\nSame with me.\n\n01:25:57.460 --> 01:25:58.980\nThis one you're literally walking through\n\n01:25:58.980 --> 01:26:01.060\nand there's, so basically they're skinning.\n\n01:26:01.060 --> 01:26:03.620\nThey're skinning the walls and they're skinning seats\n\n01:26:03.620 --> 01:26:04.780\nso that if you look at a seat,\n\n01:26:04.780 --> 01:26:06.500\nlike it's a green block, right?\n\n01:26:06.500 --> 01:26:08.340\nIn reality or like a gray block,\n\n01:26:08.340 --> 01:26:11.180\nbut in my oculus, it looks like\n\n01:26:11.180 --> 01:26:15.620\na archeological tomb and really you could feel it\n\n01:26:15.620 --> 01:26:16.980\nand it looks like you're feeling,\n\n01:26:16.980 --> 01:26:17.820\nI'm not kidding guys.\n\n01:26:17.820 --> 01:26:19.340\nI think there's a fire, they have a heater.\n\n01:26:19.340 --> 01:26:21.180\nYeah, there's a fire, they also have a wind\n\n01:26:21.180 --> 01:26:22.780\nso you look out on a waterfall\n\n01:26:22.780 --> 01:26:24.260\nand you have wind in your face\n\n01:26:24.260 --> 01:26:26.740\nand you in the game think you are looking\n\n01:26:26.740 --> 01:26:27.780\nat a goddamn waterfall.\n\n01:26:27.780 --> 01:26:30.180\nAnd there's a salad bar and it's got.\n\n01:26:30.180 --> 01:26:31.020\nYeah.\n\n01:26:31.020 --> 01:26:34.100\nIt has a, and there's a, there's a,\n\n01:26:34.100 --> 01:26:35.700\nthere's real salad in there, but then,\n\n01:26:35.700 --> 01:26:39.180\nbut to you it looks like chilled monkey brains.\n\n01:26:39.180 --> 01:26:43.100\nOh, I remember the snake surprise.\n\n01:26:43.100 --> 01:26:47.460\nI remember that guy in Temple of Doom.\n\n01:26:47.460 --> 01:26:49.420\nThat guy loved to scary food.\n\n01:26:50.380 --> 01:26:52.700\nI was like, sir, have you ever had a Snickers bar?\n\n01:26:52.700 --> 01:26:53.540\nLike, I understand.\n\n01:26:53.540 --> 01:26:55.300\nYou would have been great on fear factor.\n\n01:26:55.300 --> 01:26:58.580\nI understand the idea is that there's cultural definitions\n\n01:26:58.580 --> 01:27:00.300\nand there's some things that are scary to us.\n\n01:27:00.300 --> 01:27:03.100\nMaybe you find delicate, but, but, but,\n\n01:27:03.100 --> 01:27:06.420\nbut these are baby snakes slithering around.\n\n01:27:06.420 --> 01:27:08.140\nAnd I understand even maybe you'd go,\n\n01:27:08.140 --> 01:27:10.140\noh, I like to eat these, you know, I'm used to them.\n\n01:27:10.140 --> 01:27:12.660\nBut he's like, snake surprise.\n\n01:27:14.660 --> 01:27:18.140\nHe's so, he can't, he's like, chilled monkey brains.\n\n01:27:21.660 --> 01:27:23.780\nI'm like, I feel like you're protesting.\n\n01:27:23.780 --> 01:27:27.500\nLike, like, like, like, so, so if I bring the,\n\n01:27:27.500 --> 01:27:30.460\nthe, the, the wedge iceberg, you know,\n\n01:27:30.460 --> 01:27:31.500\nthe iceberg wedge over to you\n\n01:27:31.500 --> 01:27:33.420\nwith just some nice ranch on it,\n\n01:27:33.420 --> 01:27:38.420\nwould he go like, it's just no monkey brains.\n\n01:27:40.100 --> 01:27:40.940\nMaybe.\n\n01:27:42.540 --> 01:27:44.740\nDid you do the valve oculus with the kitchen though?\n\n01:27:44.740 --> 01:27:45.580\nDid you do that?\n\n01:27:45.580 --> 01:27:46.420\nYeah.\n\n01:27:46.420 --> 01:27:49.420\nWhat did you automatically do when you opened the fridge?\n\n01:27:49.420 --> 01:27:50.300\nI broke all the eggs.\n\n01:27:50.300 --> 01:27:51.460\nI threw them into the wall.\n\n01:27:51.460 --> 01:27:52.980\nWell, I, okay.\n\n01:27:52.980 --> 01:27:54.740\nHe dropped the carrot in the pot.\n\n01:27:54.740 --> 01:27:56.980\nYou know, well, I also,\n\n01:27:56.980 --> 01:27:57.820\nThat's all he did.\n\n01:27:57.820 --> 01:28:00.260\nI also, and, and everybody under 18,\n\n01:28:00.260 --> 01:28:03.140\nlike plug your ears not for what you, what you think,\n\n01:28:03.140 --> 01:28:06.180\nbut I just want to share something with my, my,\n\n01:28:06.180 --> 01:28:08.780\nmy fellow, my generation buddy.\n\n01:28:08.780 --> 01:28:10.380\nI, I, within three minutes,\n\n01:28:10.380 --> 01:28:13.420\nI was, I, I, I was trying to slip my throat with the knife.\n\n01:28:15.660 --> 01:28:16.500\nWow.\n\n01:28:16.500 --> 01:28:18.460\nI was, I was like, I was like,\n\n01:28:18.460 --> 01:28:19.620\nDid you see if you could do it?\n\n01:28:19.620 --> 01:28:21.860\nYeah. I was just like, well, that's a real knife.\n\n01:28:21.860 --> 01:28:24.580\nLike, like, but it's not, it's literally my throat.\n\n01:28:24.580 --> 01:28:26.300\nWell, this isn't real. This is shit.\n\n01:28:26.300 --> 01:28:27.620\nDangerous technology.\n\n01:28:28.860 --> 01:28:30.780\nBut I mean, it was like, fucking, I'm making soup.\n\n01:28:30.780 --> 01:28:31.620\nNo.\n\n01:28:31.620 --> 01:28:33.340\nOh, I wish you were here.\n\n01:28:33.340 --> 01:28:35.340\nI was trying to explain that to Jeff Davis who was\n\n01:28:35.340 --> 01:28:37.380\nusually sits over there and he's like,\n\n01:28:37.380 --> 01:28:38.220\nwhen would I?\n\n01:28:38.220 --> 01:28:39.640\nIs it like the crude tons a real?\n\n01:28:39.640 --> 01:28:43.080\nDid they, did they use a reganod sauce?\n\n01:28:43.080 --> 01:28:44.160\nI'm like, Jeff, you'd have to say this,\n\n01:28:44.160 --> 01:28:45.460\nnot it's not realistic soup.\n\n01:28:45.460 --> 01:28:48.820\nI'm saying you're can two people put on VR goggles\n\n01:28:48.820 --> 01:28:50.420\nand go into the same space.\n\n01:28:50.420 --> 01:28:51.260\nNo, I was in there.\n\n01:28:51.260 --> 01:28:52.580\nI was in the void with another person\n\n01:28:52.580 --> 01:28:55.240\nand I saw the halo that she was kind of in a halo\n\n01:28:55.240 --> 01:28:56.720\nand she was shooting and I was shooting.\n\n01:28:56.720 --> 01:28:58.100\nI was like, there's a spider behind you.\n\n01:28:58.100 --> 01:28:59.860\nAnd I was shooting her and she was like,\n\n01:28:59.860 --> 01:29:05.860\nThere was not friendly fire, basically, in that situation.\n\n01:29:05.860 --> 01:29:06.860\nNo, but that's the next term.\n\n01:29:06.860 --> 01:29:09.860\nI mean, does that make you as a storyteller, like, want to tell something?\n\n01:29:09.860 --> 01:29:12.860\nLike, do something storytelling-y in that?\n\n01:29:12.860 --> 01:29:13.860\nWhat?\n\n01:29:13.860 --> 01:29:14.860\nAre you okay?\n\n01:29:14.860 --> 01:29:15.860\nI don't even know.\n\n01:29:15.860 --> 01:29:18.860\nGet ready for a surprise!\n\n01:29:18.860 --> 01:29:19.860\nThanks.\n\n01:29:19.860 --> 01:29:20.860\nThanks.\n\n01:29:20.860 --> 01:29:21.860\nThanks, Bill.\n\n01:29:21.860 --> 01:29:25.860\nThanks everyone born in 1973.\n\n01:29:25.860 --> 01:29:26.860\nThank you.\n\n01:29:26.860 --> 01:29:27.860\nTotal recall.\n\n01:29:27.860 --> 01:29:30.860\nThe original.\n\n01:29:30.860 --> 01:29:32.860\nNo, it really freaks me out.\n\n01:29:32.860 --> 01:29:37.860\nIt excites me and kind of scares me because I'm like, oh my god, since the Lumiere brothers\n\n01:29:37.860 --> 01:29:43.860\nwe have been, like, every all storytelling has been like through a two-dimensional pain.\n\n01:29:43.860 --> 01:29:45.860\nAnd it's like...\n\n01:29:45.860 --> 01:29:46.860\nYeah!\n\n01:29:46.860 --> 01:29:50.860\nTeresa Lumiere, everybody.\n\n01:29:50.860

01:30:08.860\nPlease put your hands together for her.\n\n01:30:08.860 --> 01:30:10.860\nThe diva of...\n\n01:30:10.860 --> 01:30:11.860\nOh, wait, no.\n\n01:30:11.860 --> 01:30:12.860\nThe

01:30:17.860\nThe fem-photel of photography.\n\n01:30:17.860 --> 01:30:20.860\nLook if you look at me.\n\n01:30:20.860 --> 01:30:21.860\nThe...\n\n01:30:21.860 --> 01:30:22.860\nStorytelling.\n\n01:30:22.860 --> 01:30:28.860\nWell, yeah, because it's like, oh, this is so exciting, but then I'm like, oh, if anything\n\n01:30:28.860 --> 01:30:31.860\nputs me out of business, it's like, I might not be able to make that leap.\n\n01:30:31.860 --> 01:30:32.860\nMight not.\n\n01:30:32.860 --> 01:30:34.860\nListen how pretentious I am.\n\n01:30:34.860 --> 01:30:38.860\nEvil Knievel might not make that canyon.\n\n01:30:38.860 --> 01:30:41.860\nThat might be the grandest canyon of all.\n\n01:30:41.860 --> 01:30:45.860\nI may have to hang up my American flag helmet.\n\n01:30:45.860 --> 01:30:49.860\nThey thought Bigfoot would get me, but...\n\n01:30:49.860 --> 01:30:52.860\nThat's a $6 million Mayhem reference.\n\n01:30:52.860 --> 01:30:53.860\nThe...\n\n01:30:53.860 --> 01:30:57.860\nYeah, it's weird because what's going to happen is we're going to understand...\n\n01:30:57.860 --> 01:31:04.860\nYou're going to have to write stories even more so, like, beyond like David Mamet, you\n\n01:31:04.860 --> 01:31:08.860\nknow, writing how people talk as an audience is watching a stage.\n\n01:31:08.860 --> 01:31:09.860\nYou're going to have to just create...\n\n01:31:09.860 --> 01:31:13.580\nYou're going to have to become an expert at creating awkward moments, I think, because\n\n01:31:13.580 --> 01:31:14.580\nyou're going to want to...\n\n01:31:14.580 --> 01:31:20.100\nLike, new stories will be like, though, you know, I'm not saying we won't still enjoy watching\n\n01:31:20.100 --> 01:31:24.060\npeople run from explosions and make dynamite out of chewing gum or whatever, but fighting\n\n01:31:24.060 --> 01:31:30.500\nwerewolves, but the technology is going to be really, really, really good at, you know,\n\n01:31:30.500 --> 01:31:35.580\nyou walking into a party and like, you're just noticing things and you're just a flop.\n\n01:31:35.580 --> 01:31:36.580\nYou know, that's what we like to do.\n\n01:31:36.580 --> 01:31:39.020\nWell, this is kind of like, what is your therapist going to say?\n\n01:31:39.020 --> 01:31:44.540\nBecause I personally think as a gamer, like, people will be more drawn to doing things\n\n01:31:44.540 --> 01:31:45.540\nand group.\n\n01:31:45.540 --> 01:31:46.540\nLike, literally going on vacation.\n\n01:31:46.540 --> 01:31:47.700\nWe're also relaxing things.\n\n01:31:47.700 --> 01:31:49.620\nI think my therapist, because I really...\n\n01:31:49.620 --> 01:31:52.540\nYou're bagging on her a lot and I want you guys to get along.\n\n01:31:52.540 --> 01:31:53.540\nI want...\n\n01:31:53.540 --> 01:31:54.540\nYou'd like her if you met her.\n\n01:31:54.540 --> 01:31:55.540\nNo.\n\n01:31:55.540 --> 01:31:59.980\nShe could watch a virtual set with her lesbian wife.\n\n01:31:59.980 --> 01:32:00.980\nI think if...\n\n01:32:00.980 --> 01:32:01.980\nShe's not...\n\n01:32:01.980 --> 01:32:02.980\nShe's not like a ludite about it.\n\n01:32:02.980 --> 01:32:03.980\nShe's like...\n\n01:32:03.980 --> 01:32:04.980\nIf I was playing like, pop the...\n\n01:32:04.980 --> 01:32:05.980\nPop the...\n\n01:32:05.980 --> 01:32:06.980\nPop the cherries or whatever.\n\n01:32:06.980 --> 01:32:07.980\nPop...\n\n01:32:07.980 --> 01:32:08.980\nYeah.\n\n01:32:08.980 --> 01:32:11.980\nLike, like, like, like, like...\n\n01:32:11.980 --> 01:32:13.980\nPop the

know, like, like, something on my iPad that was like, if I told her, it relaxes me\n\n01:32:21.220 --> 01:32:24.580\nand I could be honest about that, she'd be like, great, why don't you go play that iPad\n\n01:32:24.580 --> 01:32:25.580\nand relax yourself.\n\n01:32:25.580 --> 01:32:30.300\nBut, you know, she knows and I know that I'm like, I'm going like, I got so many monsters\n\n01:32:30.300

I'm going to do it.\n\n01:32:42.940 --> 01:32:45.180\nI'm going to write the thing for Universal and I'm going to write the thing for Fox.\n\n01:32:45.180 --> 01:32:48.860\nAnd if I do that, keep my studio running, I'm going to get $3.9 million a year overhead\n\n01:32:48.860 --> 01:32:52.380\nand I'm going to say, okay, I got to get that special armor, I got to get that special

01:34:55.740\nThis is kind of art, because he's drinking water in between his sentences.\n\n01:34:55.740 --> 01:34:58.140\nI got food in the mic, I got so excited.\n\n01:34:58.140 --> 01:35:02.820\nI still don't understand how, because I play video games and I get relaxed, but if I play\n\n01:35:02.820 --> 01:35:08.220\nlike competitive games, I get horrible ass of reflux and I can't, I can't do it.\n\n01:35:08.220 --> 01:35:11.580\nLike I play here as a storm with my brother, I'm like, God damn it, get behind the creeps.\n\n01:35:11.580 --> 01:35:13.060\nYou stupid girl, you

had so, I had one experience where I was playing a Left 4 Dead one.\n\n01:35:22.060 --> 01:35:23.860\nThat was scary.\n\n01:35:23.860 --> 01:35:28.860\nAnd I just accidentally stumbled into like this group of like, you know, I didn't ask\n\n01:35:28.860 --> 01:35:33.220\nbecause I was middle-aged and it would have been weird to ask this, even no matter what,\n\n01:35:33.220 --> 01:35:38.740\nbut it was like, I got the sense that I stumbled into a group of younger guys that knew each\n\n01:35:38.740 --> 01:35:43.220\nother from high school and that were either gay or bi or something, because they just\n\n01:35:43.220 --> 01:35:49.420\nlike, they seemed, they just, they weren't calling me faggot every five seconds is one\n\n01:35:49.420 --> 01:35:56.620\nthing that I was like, I think these guys are gay, because they're not fucking calling\n\n01:35:56.620 --> 01:35:57.620\nme a faggot.\n\n01:35:57.620 --> 01:35:59.980\nThey call you the N word, they call you the N

of\n\n01:39:01.020 --> 01:39:12.420\nthe figure, oh wow, wow, a kid named after a character in a movie I saw when I was 20.\n\n01:39:12.420 --> 01:39:19.780\nI'm going to just dig a hole, lay down, and hand you the shovel, because my back will\n\n01:39:19.780 --> 01:39:26.980\nhurt from digging the hole, I remember when Steve Martin was hosting the Oscars, I like,\n\n01:39:26.980 --> 01:39:34.060\nI like talking to the young creatives of today because it reminds me of my death.\n\n01:39:34.060 --> 01:39:40.220\nWell, welcome Dewey, thanks for coming up, well, I don't, it's not like you're doing\n\n01:39:40.220 --> 01:39:43.580\nit as a favor, you shout it out, I want to be up there.\n\n01:39:43.580 --> 01:39:45.380\nYou're welcome Dewey, is what I should be saying.\n\n01:39:45.380 --> 01:39:47.660\nI have a little self-control.\n\n01:39:47.660 --> 01:39:48.660\nI've noticed.\n\n01:39:48.660 --> 01:39:52.700\nHave you actually played Shadowrun before, Dewey?\n\n01:39:52.700 --> 01:39:53.700\nOh, not in my life.\n\n01:39:53.700 --> 01:39:58.540\nWell, you're unqualified, get out the stage, no, I have no experience.\n\n01:39:58.540 --> 01:40:07.020\nThe kitchen's behind the camera, it'll be a wild card.\n\n01:40:07.020 --> 01:40:12.500\nOkay, so Felicia will give you the first choice, you could be, the character my wife usually\n\n01:40:12.500 --> 01:40:18.900\nplays who's like the face man, god damn it, I can never get his name straight.\n\n01:40:18.900 --> 01:40:19.900\nWhat?\n\n01:40:19.900 --> 01:40:24.420\nI can't remember Erin's character's name, it's Mercy O'Donnell, she's sort of like,\n\n01:40:24.420 --> 01:40:28.340\nshe's like the smart talker, like she gets us the jobs and stuff and like kinds of people\n\n01:40:28.340 --> 01:40:29.340\nand stuff.\n\n01:40:29.340 --> 01:40:30.340\nAlright, that's not bad.\n\n01:40:30.340 --> 01:40:35.820\nJeff Davis' character's Eve Libertine, she's like a sprightly fucking, I don't even know,\n\n01:40:35.820 --> 01:40:36.820\nwizard.\n\n01:40:36.820 --> 01:40:37.820\nShe's a mage.\n\n01:40:37.820 --> 01:40:39.820\nGive this down to Demorige, because he's here.\n\n01:40:39.820 --> 01:40:44.820\nNah, we don't have any Deckers, they're actually really complicated, so not like that, but,\n\n01:40:44.820 --> 01:40:49.740\nbut, so none of these guys actually know how to play Shadowrun, so, and then there's like\n\n01:40:49.740 --> 01:40:52.540\na mob doctor named Dr. Friend.\n\n01:40:52.540 --> 01:40:59.100\nI don't want to be the doctor, I'll be, Mercy O'Donnell, the face man, or the face lady,\n\n01:40:59.100 --> 01:41:04.140\nor, I'll be the face lady, that's not, I like having a high, a lot of skills where I talk\n\n01:41:04.140 --> 01:41:05.620\nmy way through things.\n\n01:41:05.620 --> 01:41:10.660\nOkay, so, and then what do you want to be, the doctor, or, oh yeah, well just, we'll\n\n01:41:10.660 --> 01:41:16.380\nhave, hand that down to Steve Agee, and then hand this down to Dewey, Dewey you're going\n\n01:41:16.380 --> 01:41:18.380\nto be Dr. Friend.\n\n01:41:18.380 --> 01:41:28.620\nAll right, all right, um, you know how to play Shadowrun?\n\n01:41:28.620 --> 01:41:30.260\nThe contractual timer.\n\n01:41:30.260 --> 01:41:31.260\nYou're learning?\n\n01:41:31.260 --> 01:41:32.260\nOkay.\n\n01:41:32.260 --> 01:41:36.220\nYeah, shit man.\n\n01:41:36.220 --> 01:41:40.500\nSo uh, yeah, I mean it's um, we never know what's going on, I don't remember what we\n\n01:41:40.500 --> 01:41:42.780\ndid last time, we're always this drunk when we start playing.\n\n01:41:42.780 --> 01:41:47.180\nThere's like a drawing from Rick and Morty here, look at that, is this how, is this\n\n01:41:47.180 --> 01:41:48.940\nwhere it happens?\n\n01:41:48.940 --> 01:41:56.860\nYeah, yeah, so we don't have any musical cue, I'd assume, right, that's fine.\n\n01:41:56.860 --> 01:41:57.860\nDon't worry.\n\n01:41:57.860 --> 01:41:58.860\nOh shit.\n\n01:41:58.860 --> 01:41:59.860\nI just want to confirm verbally.\n\n01:41:59.860 --> 01:42:01.380\nAll right, I'll give you a little something.\n\n01:42:01.380 --> 01:42:05.420\nI mean, wow, my phone just turned blue.\n\n01:42:05.420 --> 01:42:09.060\nHave you ever seen a blue screen on an iPhone?\n\n01:42:09.060 --> 01:42:15.300\nYeah, well the new one came out, so, yeah, yeah, good point, so all of these are dying.\n\n01:42:15.300 --> 01:42:20.340\nWell it's a good thing that nothing happened last week, um, I was going to read Jason\n\n01:42:20.340 --> 01:42:24.420\nClymer, he's the one who recapped the last time we needed a recap, I was going to read\n\n01:42:24.420 --> 01:42:31.740\nhis recap because it said, the gang walked around in a storage facility arguing about\n\n01:42:31.740 --> 01:42:38.980\nwhat they should do, Eve Libertine sent out some crickets, nothing happened, end of recap.\n\n01:42:38.980 --> 01:42:43.380\nYeah, it was something like that.\n\n01:42:43.380 --> 01:42:49.620\nAll right, so we got, we got a lot of fresh faces, so I'll do like a real, like an actual\n\n01:42:49.620 --> 01:42:56.180\nverbal not prepared recap, so you had entered store quest, the storage facility, a multi-floored\n\n01:42:56.180 --> 01:43:02.140\nstorage facility, you walked in the front door and started a costing, a costing the,\n\n01:43:02.140 --> 01:43:10.180\nI guess the cashier at the storage facility, and then you murdered him in cold blood.\n\n01:43:10.180 --> 01:43:13.340\nAfter that happened, you walked through the door that you could have always walked through\n\n01:43:13.340 --> 01:43:19.780\nthe whole time without killing anybody, sending out some crickets, you tried to search for\n\n01:43:19.780 --> 01:43:26.780\nyour quarry, your quarry was a big load, a big storage container full of MP3s, MP3s\n\n01:43:26.780 --> 01:43:32.300\nthat were locked by specific, very high security musical locks.\n\n01:43:32.300 --> 01:43:36.620\nIf you recall, you learned perfect pitch from a strange conservatory for the sole purpose\n\n01:43:36.620 --> 01:43:40.860\nof defeating these musical locks.\n\n01:43:40.860 --> 01:43:45.060\nWhat the fuck are you talking about?\n\n01:43:45.060 --> 01:43:47.260\nThey're locks that unlock with music.\n\n01:43:47.260 --> 01:43:48.260\nOkay.\n\n01:43:48.260 --> 01:43:50.140\nWell, yeah, it's pretty straightforward.\n\n01:43:50.140 --> 01:43:51.140\nOkay.\n\n01:43:51.140 --> 01:43:52.140\nOkay, that's it.\n\n01:43:52.140 --> 01:43:53.140\nThat's all that happened.\n\n01:43:53.140 --> 01:43:54.140\nYou guys were arguing.\n\n01:43:54.140 --> 01:43:55.140\nYou're standing there in the floor.\n\n01:43:55.140 --> 01:43:57.300\nThere's a dead guy in the other room.\n\n01:43:57.300 --> 01:43:58.300\nThere's cameras everywhere.\n\n01:43:58.300 --> 01:44:00.980\nYou don't know, you know, yeah.\n\n01:44:00.980 --> 01:44:04.860\nYou were just talking to Hat Guy, who's the, on the, on the phone.\n\n01:44:04.860 --> 01:44:05.860\nYeah.\n\n01:44:05.860 --> 01:44:07.260\nHat Guy or Hat Guy?\n\n01:44:07.260 --> 01:44:08.260\nHat Guy.\n\n01:44:08.260 --> 01:44:09.260\nIt's like Hawkeye, but hacking.\n\n01:44:09.260 --> 01:44:10.260\nOkay.\n\n01:44:10.260 --> 01:44:11.260\nGot you.\n\n01:44:11.260 --> 01:44:12.260\nIt's a bad joke.\n\n01:44:12.260 --> 01:44:13.260\nYeah.\n\n01:44:13.260 --> 01:44:21.540\nHey, Hat Guy, are you, I think what the conversation we're having is, were you able to parse the,\n\n01:44:21.540 --> 01:44:24.940\nany information to give us more, you know, zero in on the.\n\n01:44:24.940 --> 01:44:25.940\nNo.\n\n01:44:25.940 --> 01:44:29.540\nI mean, I told you that there's no of that, there's none of that information available.\n\n01:44:29.540 --> 01:44:30.900\nIt's, there's nothing like that.\n\n01:44:30.900 --> 01:44:33.660\nI mean, you're looking for a vault that's locked with me.\n\n01:44:33.660 --> 01:44:35.380\nI don't know what you're saying, man.\n\n01:44:35.380 --> 01:44:38.340\nYou're looking, you're looking through a vault, you're looking for a vault that's locked with\n\n01:44:38.340 --> 01:44:40.460\nmusical locks, right?\n\n01:44:40.460 --> 01:44:43.100\nMusical locks, maybe different than other locks.\n\n01:44:43.100 --> 01:44:44.300\nLet me, let me look this shit up.\n\n01:44:44.300 --> 01:44:48.860\nI've literally never heard of a musical lock in all of my shadow running days, but I will\n\n01:44:48.860 --> 01:44:50.860\nlook it up and get back to you.\n\n01:44:50.860 --> 01:44:51.860\nOkay.\n\n01:44:51.860 --> 01:44:55.860\nI'll just walk around and look at all the locks.\n\n01:44:55.860 --> 01:44:56.860\nAll right.\n\n01:44:56.860 --> 01:44:57.980\nYou do that.\n\n01:44:57.980 --> 01:45:02.860\nYou see, you see a vault that's locked with large, large magenta locks.\n\n01:45:02.860 --> 01:45:04.860\nHey guys, check it out.\n\n01:45:04.860 --> 01:45:11.980\nIt's not like any lock I've ever seen.\n\n01:45:11.980 --> 01:45:16.500\nLooks like one of those musical locks.\n\n01:45:16.500 --> 01:45:19.700\nIs this going to open if I sing?\n\n01:45:19.700 --> 01:45:22.660\nLike is it that kind of musical lock?\n\n01:45:22.660 --> 01:45:23.660\nI don't know.\n\n01:45:23.660 --> 01:45:27.980\nDo you smell egg on the lock because I have a mother's egg allergy and it says here and\n\n01:45:27.980 --> 01:45:30.140\nI could not be near egg.\n\n01:45:30.140 --> 01:45:31.140\nNo.\n\n01:45:31.140 --> 01:45:32.140\nThere's no eggs.\n\n01:45:32.140 --> 01:45:38.780\nI might suggest that one of us possibly to start off singing a tone, a pure tone like\n\n01:45:38.780 --> 01:45:42.140\nwe've just learned to see if the lock moves or adjusts in any way.\n\n01:45:42.140 --> 01:45:45.140\nI was in Chokwaya.\n\n01:45:45.140 --> 01:45:46.140\nSo.\n\n01:45:46.140 --> 01:45:47.140\nIce cream.\n\n01:45:47.140 --> 01:45:48.140\nIce cream.\n\n01:45:48.140 --> 01:45:49.140\nIce cream.\n\n01:45:49.140 --> 01:45:50.140\nIce cream.\n\n01:45:50.140 --> 01:46:02.140\nIce cream.\n\n01:46:02.140 --> 01:46:06.140\nIce cream.\n\n01:46:06.140 --> 01:46:11.140\nNothing happens.\n\n01:46:11.140 --> 01:46:16.140\nNothing happens.\n\n01:46:16.140 --> 01:46:22.140\nWhether it works or not, it was a beautiful song.\n\n01:46:22.140 --> 01:46:26.140\nI'm going to look at this lock with my image medical verification monocle.\n\n01:46:26.140 --> 01:46:28.140\nI have a spy monocle.\n\n01:46:28.140 --> 01:46:29.140\nYou do.\n\n01:46:29.140 --> 01:46:32.140\nIt reveals several details about the lock's construction.\n\n01:46:32.140 --> 01:46:33.140\nHoly shit.\n\n01:46:33.140 --> 01:46:37.140\nOne, the lock's casing is made just of regular ass plastic.\n\n01:46:37.140 --> 01:46:44.140\nAnd two, on the back of the lock is engraved a specific, there's a very specific set of\n\n01:46:44.140 --> 01:46:46.940\nwords, almost like a sentence or a message.\n\n01:46:46.940 --> 01:46:52.140\nThe words they say, Frankie Franks, album one track two.\n\n01:46:52.140 --> 01:46:53.140\nOh.\n\n01:46:53.140 --> 01:46:54.140\nFrankie Franks.\n\n01:46:54.140 --> 01:46:56.140\nFrankie Franks, album one track two.\n\n01:46:56.140 --> 01:46:59.140\nWe got to find that album and that track.\n\n01:46:59.140 --> 01:47:00.140\nWe already have it.\n\n01:47:00.140 --> 01:47:02.140\nYeah, the cricket brought it back.\n\n01:47:02.140 --> 01:47:03.140\nThe cricket brought it back.\n\n01:47:03.140 --> 01:47:04.140\nThe cricket brought it back.\n\n01:47:04.140 --> 01:47:06.140\nWait, the cricket brought back an mp3?\n\n01:47:06.140 --> 01:47:07.140\nYeah.\n\n01:47:07.140 --> 01:47:10.140\nLet's play that shit.\n\n01:47:10.140 --> 01:47:16.140\nAll right, I'll put it, put somebody put it in there, player.\n\n01:47:16.140 --> 01:47:22.140\nI do not have an mp3 on me, but I have a moderate egg allergy.\n\n01:47:22.140 --> 01:47:23.140\nSo please.\n\n01:47:23.140 --> 01:47:29.140\nI have a skill soft that I could apply it to.\n\n01:47:29.140 --> 01:47:31.140\nSo if we apply it to that, I could actually play it possibly.\n\n01:47:31.140 --> 01:47:32.140\nYeah, man.\n\n01:47:32.140 --> 01:47:34.140\nYou can jack it into your brain hole.\n\n01:47:34.140 --> 01:47:40.140\nGreat.\n\n01:47:40.140 --> 01:47:46.140\nIt was Saturday night and you were standing by the window.\n\n01:47:46.140 --> 01:47:47.140\nIt's very beautiful.\n\n01:47:47.140 --> 01:47:50.140\nI said, I love that look on you.\n\n01:47:50.140 --> 01:47:59.140\nThe lock snaps open.\n\n01:47:59.140 --> 01:48:05.140\nI can't believe we took all those fucking lessons together.\n\n01:48:05.140 --> 01:48:07.140\nThose fucking children.\n\n01:48:07.140 --> 01:48:14.140\nAs the roller door rolls open automatically, you see stacks of note boxes upon boxes full\n\n01:48:14.140 --> 01:48:17.140\nof mp3 data chips.\n\n01:48:17.140 --> 01:48:20.140\nIt's a real mother load.\n\n01:48:20.140 --> 01:48:24.140\nThese are very valuable, I believe.\n\n01:48:24.140 --> 01:48:28.140\nIt's the best Christmas dinner I ever had.\n\n01:48:28.140 --> 01:48:37.140\nThat's a clip from the diehard trilogy video game on the first PlayStation.\n\n01:48:37.140 --> 01:48:39.140\nWas that the arcade game where you were like fighting?\n\n01:48:39.140 --> 01:48:42.140\nYeah, well, there was three diehard games.\n\n01:48:42.140 --> 01:48:44.140\nOne was like crazy taxi.\n\n01:48:44.140 --> 01:48:49.140\nOne of them, you're just running around like a top down third person thing.\n\n01:48:49.140 --> 01:48:50.140\nI loved that one.\n\n01:48:50.140 --> 01:48:54.140\nAnd when you found, when you'd find health ups, sometimes you'd say random things,\n\n01:48:54.140 --> 01:49:00.140\none of them being, it's the best Christmas dinner I ever had.\n\n01:49:00.140 --> 01:49:03.140\nAnd then when you got hit, sometimes you'd go, all things being considered,\n\n01:49:03.140 --> 01:49:10.140\nI'd rather be a Philadelphia.\n\n01:49:10.140 --> 01:49:14.140\nMp3 chips, more than you can carry on your own.\n\n01:49:14.140 --> 01:49:15.140\nWe can carry all of these.\n\n01:49:15.140 --> 01:49:17.140\nMore than that.\n\n01:49:17.140 --> 01:49:22.140\nI still believe we can carry all of these.\n\n01:49:22.140 --> 01:49:24.140\nOkay, sorry, I missed that part.\n\n01:49:24.140 --> 01:49:26.140\nWe can't carry all of these?\n\n01:49:26.140 --> 01:49:27.140\nI believe we can carry all of these.\n\n01:49:27.140 --> 01:49:31.140\nI start eating these Mp3 chips so that they sit in my stomach.\n\n01:49:31.140 --> 01:49:36.140\nQuickly, Dr. Frank, please ascertain if they're made of egg in any way.\n\n01:49:36.140 --> 01:49:37.140\nThey're not.\n\n01:49:37.140 --> 01:49:38.140\nDo some sort of scan.\n\n01:49:38.140 --> 01:49:40.140\nOh no, you could just tell by looking at them.\n\n01:49:40.140 --> 01:49:42.140\nThese are the egg-free ones.\n\n01:49:42.140 --> 01:49:43.140\nOh good.\n\n01:49:43.140 --> 01:49:48.140\nIs it possible to load the data from them without using the physical casing?\n\n01:49:48.140 --> 01:49:51.140\nOh yeah, you could definitely rip all of them, but it takes some time.\n\n01:49:51.140 --> 01:49:52.140\nI'll be right back.\n\n01:49:52.140 --> 01:49:53.140\nI've got an idea.\n\n01:49:53.140 --> 01:49:55.140\nI'm going to go to the outside.\n\n01:49:55.140 --> 01:49:57.140\nOh, we came here in an Uber, right?\n\n01:49:57.140 --> 01:49:58.140\nYep.\n\n01:49:58.140 --> 01:50:00.140\nShit, I come back.\n\n01:50:00.140 --> 01:50:06.140\nI had an idea, but I kept picturing us as having a car.\n\n01:50:06.140 --> 01:50:08.140\nMaybe you should get one.\n\n01:50:08.140 --> 01:50:13.140\nWell, you know, but we drink a lot, and I think that all things considered,\n\n01:50:13.140 --> 01:50:15.140\nI think we're saving a lot.\n\n01:50:15.140 --> 01:50:17.140\nThat's not how driving works in the future.\n\n01:50:17.140 --> 01:50:20.140\nThey let you do it drunk?\n\n01:50:20.140 --> 01:50:21.140\nYeah.\n\n01:50:21.140 --> 01:50:23.140\nThe computer doesn't for you, man.\n\n01:50:23.140 --> 01:50:25.140\nGuys, we got to get a car.\n\n01:50:25.140 --> 01:50:30.140\nMaybe we can take all of these MP3 pairs and sell one and buy a car.\n\n01:50:30.140 --> 01:50:34.140\nI'm scared someone will hack our onboard computer in the car and kill us.\n\n01:50:34.140 --> 01:50:35.140\nAll right, okay.\n\n01:50:35.140 --> 01:50:36.140\nAll right, hold on.\n\n01:50:36.140 --> 01:50:37.140\nI know a guy that died.\n\n01:50:37.140 --> 01:50:39.140\nI'll be right back.\n\n01:50:39.140 --> 01:50:40.140\nI'll be right back.\n\n01:50:40.140 --> 01:50:41.140\nI got a second idea.\n\n01:50:41.140 --> 01:50:42.140\nI run out.\n\n01:50:42.140 --> 01:50:44.140\nI'm looking for a car, just a stranger's car.\n\n01:50:44.140 --> 01:50:45.140\nAll right.\n\n01:50:45.140 --> 01:50:47.140\nBecause, you know...\n\n01:50:47.140 --> 01:50:48.140\nOh, so it's a storage...\n\n01:50:48.140 --> 01:50:49.140\nYeah, they even find a car.\n\n01:50:49.140 --> 01:50:50.140\nIt is a storage facility.\n\n01:50:50.140 --> 01:50:53.140\nI would think that there was a lift or a cart of some kind.\n\n01:50:53.140 --> 01:50:55.140\nThere's like a loading dock.\n\n01:50:55.140 --> 01:50:56.140\nI mean, there's carts.\n\n01:50:56.140 --> 01:51:00.140\nYou don't know where they are, though, because you killed the guy.\n\n01:51:00.140 --> 01:51:06.140\nI'm going to use my knowledge as a former law enforcement officer,\n\n01:51:06.140 --> 01:51:10.140\nincluding my undercover training as a criminal.\n\n01:51:10.140 --> 01:51:11.140\nMy back story is very complicated,\n\n01:51:11.140 --> 01:51:15.140\nand along the way, I certainly learned how to hotwire a car.\n\n01:51:15.140 --> 01:51:17.140\nI have a cellular glove maker.\n\n01:51:17.140 --> 01:51:22.140\nSo I would make a glove that can lift everything and float it away.\n\n01:51:22.140 --> 01:51:25.140\nYou couldn't make a glove that strong.\n\n01:51:25.140 --> 01:51:28.140\nThe glove maker is for fingerprints and stuff.\n\n01:51:28.140 --> 01:51:30.140\nIt's for spoofing fingerprints.\n\n01:51:30.140 --> 01:51:33.140\nOkay, so this is not going to work.\n\n01:51:33.140 --> 01:51:37.140\nHow about you load the chips into me?\n\n01:51:37.140 --> 01:51:41.140\nThat's a great idea.\n\n01:51:41.140 --> 01:51:42.140\nThat's your solution to everything.\n\n01:51:42.140 --> 01:51:48.140\nThen I'll be your jukebox, your carrying facility, your transporter.\n\n01:51:48.140 --> 01:51:51.140\nBut someone would have to pull out weapons and guard the door,\n\n01:51:51.140 --> 01:51:53.140\nand someone would have to feed at the same time.\n\n01:51:53.140 --> 01:51:55.140\nI've noticed that I can increase my body.\n\n01:51:55.140 --> 01:51:57.140\nCould I possibly get larger and carry more?\n\n01:51:57.140 --> 01:51:58.140\nYeah, definitely.\n\n01:51:58.140 --> 01:52:00.140\nIt'll help you somewhat.\n\n01:52:00.140 --> 01:52:01.140\nYou do that.\n\n01:52:01.140 --> 01:52:06.140\nYou get too larger.\n\n01:52:06.140 --> 01:52:08.140\nI pick up twice as many chips as before.\n\n01:52:08.140 --> 01:52:11.140\nWell, that's not how the math works out.\n\n01:52:11.140 --> 01:52:18.140\nYou pick up 45% more chips.\n\n01:52:18.140 --> 01:52:23.140\nYou're still not nearly to catgathering them all, though.\n\n01:52:23.140 --> 01:52:25.140\nIt's going to take some time.\n\n01:52:25.140 --> 01:52:27.140\nThe car, it gets hot wired.\n\n01:52:27.140 --> 01:52:32.140\nBest Christmas dinner I ever had.\n\n01:52:32.140 --> 01:52:38.140\nWhere are you going?\n\n01:52:38.140 --> 01:52:45.140\nI was getting a handle.\n\n01:52:45.140 --> 01:52:48.140\nWhere am I?\n\n01:52:48.140 --> 01:52:50.140\nYou're outside the place.\n\n01:52:50.140 --> 01:52:56.140\nI'm going to drive through the doors and up to the storage unit.\n\n01:52:56.140 --> 01:52:58.140\nI'm going to flip a bitch.\n\n01:52:58.140 --> 01:53:00.140\nIs that still a phrase?\n\n01:53:00.140 --> 01:53:01.140\nYeah.\n\n01:53:01.140 --> 01:53:04.140\nAnd then I'm going to back in through the doors.\n\n01:53:04.140 --> 01:53:07.140\nSo it's like, from their point of view, I said I'll be right back.\n\n01:53:07.140 --> 01:53:09.140\nAfter that first fuck-up, which was a little embarrassing.\n\n01:53:09.140 --> 01:53:11.140\nOver time, they'll forget it, though.\n\n01:53:11.140 --> 01:53:13.140\nBecause the second time, I said, now I got a different idea.\n\n01:53:13.140 --> 01:53:16.140\nAnd I left, and then...\n\n01:53:16.140 --> 01:53:17.140\nAnd I came through.\n\n01:53:17.140 --> 01:53:18.140\nIt's kind of cool.\n\n01:53:18.140 --> 01:53:20.140\nYeah, your car smashes through the loading dock.\n\n01:53:20.140 --> 01:53:21.140\nIt arrives.\n\n01:53:21.140 --> 01:53:25.140\nIt pulls to a stop right outside the thing.\n\n01:53:25.140 --> 01:53:29.140\nYou guys call it a car guy?\n\n01:53:29.140 --> 01:53:30.140\nNo, we didn't.\n\n01:53:30.140 --> 01:53:31.140\nBut awesome.\n\n01:53:31.140 --> 01:53:33.140\nHe did when he's suave.\n\n01:53:33.140 --> 01:53:34.140\nHe's not French.\n\n01:53:34.140 --> 01:53:35.140\nHe's going to be suave.\n\n01:53:35.140 --> 01:53:37.140\nI have a...\n\n01:53:37.140 --> 01:53:38.140\nOpen the trunk.\n\n01:53:38.140 --> 01:53:40.140\nLet's start shoveling this shit out.\n\n01:53:40.140 --> 01:53:45.140\nAnd I would like to use my adrenaline boost to help both in strength and in velocity,\n\n01:53:45.140 --> 01:53:49.140\nas I move these faster and faster and faster.\n\n01:53:49.140 --> 01:53:53.140\nBoth your strength and your velocity are improved by your adrenaline boost\n\n01:53:53.140 --> 01:53:59.140\nas you load mp3 chips into the trunk of a car.\n\n01:53:59.140 --> 01:54:02.140\nSoon, all the chips are loaded in the car.\n\n01:54:02.140 --> 01:54:03.140\nExcellent.\n\n01:54:03.140 --> 01:54:07.140\nIt was great.\n\n01:54:07.140 --> 01:54:11.140\nImagine being the guy that grew two sizes.\n\n01:54:11.140 --> 01:54:15.140\nYeah, there's no decreased body on my list.\n\n01:54:15.140 --> 01:54:19.140\nDo I need to walk home or...?\n\n01:54:19.140 --> 01:54:21.140\nHop on the roof, dude.\n\n01:54:21.140 --> 01:54:23.140\nYou can disperse it if you want.\n\n01:54:23.140 --> 01:54:24.140\nI want?\n\n01:54:24.140 --> 01:54:25.140\nIf you want.\n\n01:54:25.140 --> 01:54:26.140\nYeah, I do.\n\n01:54:26.140 --> 01:54:27.140\nVery much.\n\n01:54:27.140 --> 01:54:29.140\nThat happens.\n\n01:54:29.140 --> 01:54:35.140\nTurning to normal size, you realize you could fit in this car.\n\n01:54:35.140 --> 01:54:38.140\nYou hear Hakai buzzing in on your earpieces.\n\n01:54:38.140 --> 01:54:44.140\nHe's like, hey man, I was looking up musical locks and I was slipping.\n\n01:54:44.140 --> 01:54:51.140\nI didn't kill the live video feed that gets sent to the police station.\n\n01:54:51.140 --> 01:54:57.140\nSo, you got about 30 seconds before this place is surrounded.\n\n01:54:57.140 --> 01:55:00.140\nGet in the car, get in the car.\n\n01:55:00.140 --> 01:55:01.140\nThey're playing.\n\n01:55:01.140 --> 01:55:06.140\nBut wait, so the cops are going to know what we look like forever?\n\n01:55:06.140 --> 01:55:09.140\nOh, I mean, they already know what you look like.\n\n01:55:09.140 --> 01:55:11.140\nWe're shadow runners.\n\n01:55:11.140 --> 01:55:12.140\nOkay.\n\n01:55:12.140 --> 01:55:13.140\nEverybody in.\n\n01:55:13.140 --> 01:55:14.140\nLet's get the fuck out of here.\n\n01:55:14.140 --> 01:55:15.140\nLet's get the fuck out of here.\n\n01:55:15.140 --> 01:55:17.140\nI feel like someone did not do their job properly.\n\n01:55:17.140 --> 01:55:19.140\nYeah, I fucked up.\n\n01:55:19.140 --> 01:55:21.140\nAll right, let's talk about it later.\n\n01:55:21.140 --> 01:55:27.140\nIn his defense, we always forget to bring him, because he's a non-player character.\n\n01:55:27.140 --> 01:55:28.140\nEverybody in?\n\n01:55:28.140 --> 01:55:29.140\nYep.\n\n01:55:29.140 --> 01:55:30.140\nAll right.\n\n01:55:30.140 --> 01:55:31.140\nWee.\n\n01:55:31.140 --> 01:55:36.140\nAll things considered, rather than being

her.\n\n01:55:51.140 --> 01:55:52.140\nGet her booked.\n\n01:55:52.140 --> 01:55:54.140\nYou're never weird on the internet.\n\n01:55:54.140 --> 01:55:55.140\nAlmost.\n\n01:55:55.140 --> 01:55:56.140\nAlmost.\n\n01:55:56.140 --> 01:55:57.140\nYeah.\n\n01:55:57.140 --> 01:55:58.140\nCheck it out.\n\n01:55:58.140 --> 01:56:02.140\nIt's four and a half hours at 1.25

times in his life, who is responsible\n\n01:56:26.140 --> 01:56:28.140\nfor making this streaming stuff happen.\n\n01:56:28.140 --> 01:56:32.140\nThank you, Kevin, and who probably was our connection to Felicia.\n\n01:56:32.140 --> 01:56:33.140\nYeah, thank you guys so much.\n\n01:56:33.140 --> 01:56:42.140\nWe'll see you next week.\n\n01:56:42.140 --> 01:56:49.140\nGet any of
