up like like up hillhurst right now with like a can of Coors in their hand casually strolling

04:50.180 --> 04:55.620
to look at the moon at the Gryffin Observatory like I have no I don't think they've ever

04:55.620 --> 04:59.540
I don't think they know how far they're walking yeah it's like four or five miles I think

04:59.540 --> 05:03.380
it's like people who see this I can see the looks are from here and then Las Vegas you

about about our delightful guests that we're going to talk about and there's only one thing

05:25.420 --> 05:33.260
that's not that and it says where the moon I was once in my car and I was at the Denny's

05:33.260 --> 05:39.500
parking lot over at Gower Gulch and there were a bunch of guys hanging out in the parking

05:39.500 --> 05:44.620

08:53.220 --> 09:00.700
not stab me and just before anyone says anything he was white he was a white drunk man this

09:00.700 --> 09:06.860
is not racial motivated fear that's nice I've got turned out just drunk just I pictured

09:06.860 --> 09:11.900

09:25.420 --> 09:33.140
Frank yeah Spencer his name is not Frank yeah he just wanted to break down some hardcore

09:33.140 --> 09:37.340
statistics with you about homelessness I was like you could be whatever you want to be

09:37.340 --> 09:42.100

09:42.100 --> 09:49.060

09:53.340 --> 09:58.160

09:58.160 --> 10:05.740
yeah I'm thinking and he's like that's good that's good and then he was just the rest

10:05.740 --> 10:09.100
of the time he was just commenting on how great it was that I was thinking and I thought

10:09.100 --> 10:11.540
he was going to turn into an angry mode at some point.

10:11.540 --> 10:13.780
Like, you know, like, this guy's thinking too much.

10:13.780 --> 10:17.820
But he cooled off, and then he shook someone else's hand,

10:17.820 --> 10:20.820
and then he wandered off.

10:20.820 --> 10:25.780
First of all, that sounds like, he sounds like that smart bot

10:25.780 --> 10:28.820
online, you know, like the one where you're child.

10:28.820 --> 10:31.860
The one where it's just based on previous people's entries.

10:31.860 --> 10:34.620
So even though it's really cool what it says to you,

10:34.620 --> 10:37.340
the conversation doesn't, it only lasts a couple of minutes.

10:37.340 --> 10:39.220
So you go like, hey, how are you?

10:39.220 --> 10:40.500
And it says something amazing.

10:40.500 --> 10:42.860
Like, hey, what do you think of John Travolta?

10:42.860 --> 10:44.900
And you're like, whoa, you like John Travolta?

10:44.900 --> 10:46.060
And he's like, what do you like?

10:46.060 --> 10:48.180
Yeah, that's, that's what it's like.

10:48.180 --> 10:50.020
I like popcorn.

10:50.020 --> 10:51.580
Pop, pop my corn.

10:51.580 --> 10:52.700
And you're like, OK.

10:52.700 --> 10:54.580
That's how it is to talk to my roommate.

10:54.580 --> 10:56.620
When I'm talking to him, it feels like that.

10:56.620 --> 10:58.660
Because I'm just like, hey, how's it going?

10:58.660 --> 11:00.020
And he's like, how you doing?

11:00.020 --> 11:01.500
And I'm like, I'm doing good.

11:01.500 --> 11:03.620
And he's like, doing good is good.

11:03.620 --> 11:04.980
And I'm like, what?

11:04.980 --> 11:06.580
And he's like, doing my what?

11:06.580 --> 11:09.700
And I'm like, Jesus, this is not a conversation.

11:09.700 --> 11:12.180
And he's like, conversations are doing my what?

11:12.180 --> 11:14.700
And then he just wanders out.

11:14.700 --> 11:16.980
I'm like, this guy's a robot.

11:16.980 --> 11:19.300
Remember when we were at that bar in Culver City

11:19.300 --> 11:22.220
and those guys came in?

11:22.220 --> 11:23.660
Oh my god.

11:23.660 --> 11:24.860
And they were trying to like.

11:24.860 --> 11:28.020
Now that was racial motivated fear.

11:28.020 --> 11:31.020
Well, it was because it was like an all, it was like,

11:31.020 --> 11:34.900
yeah, because they were, it was a, what is the, what is it?

11:34.900 --> 11:38.100
It was this old, old white guy's bar.

11:38.100 --> 11:40.380
There's, there's just old, old dudes hanging out.

11:40.380 --> 11:43.780
And then we wandered in and then these Mexican guys showed up

11:43.780 --> 11:47.660
and they were really fucking high, which isn't a problem,

11:47.660 --> 11:49.700
but they seemed to carry on as if,

11:49.700 --> 11:52.300
if people knew they were high, they'd get arrested.

11:52.300 --> 11:53.140
Right.

11:53.140 --> 11:56.620
So it created a lot of tension right off the bat.

11:56.620 --> 11:59.340
And it was not dialed down from that point on.

11:59.340 --> 12:01.420
And it felt like the, it felt like the bigger guy was like

12:01.420 --> 12:03.340
the littler guy's uncle or something.

12:03.340 --> 12:04.940
It didn't feel like they were hanging out as friends.

12:04.940 --> 12:08.060
It was almost like, like this is the equivalent of,

12:08.060 --> 12:10.300
of in the Midwest of being dragged into the woods

12:10.300 --> 12:11.540
to go deer hunting.

12:11.540 --> 12:12.900
And he's just like, come on,

12:12.900 --> 12:14.780
I'm going to take you into this white people's bar

12:14.780 --> 12:17.140
and we're going to, we're going to get yelled at.

12:17.140 --> 12:22.140
And then you'll be a man because he really wanted like,

12:22.500 --> 12:25.420
he wanted to get yelled at, but, but everybody was like,

12:25.420 --> 12:27.380
like, okay, it's like, like, yeah.

12:27.380 --> 12:30.940
So the younger guy, he was really like drunk and high,

12:30.940 --> 12:33.300
but he was having a great time and he just wanted to talk

12:33.300 --> 12:35.420
about football and he was in a great mood

12:35.420 --> 12:36.860
and everyone was loving it.

12:36.860 --> 12:39.260
But we were loving it too much for the older guy.

12:39.260 --> 12:41.740
Cause he thought that we were making fun of the little guy,

12:41.740 --> 12:43.500
but we were just, he was great, you know,

12:43.500 --> 12:44.340
he was having fun.

12:44.340 --> 12:45.180
We were just yes standing him.

12:45.180 --> 12:47.380
He wanted to talk about like moon boots or whatever came up.

12:47.380 --> 12:48.220
Yeah.

12:48.220 --> 12:49.100
And we're like, oh, what about moon boots?

12:49.100 --> 12:49.920
You remember moon boots?

12:49.920 --> 12:51.460
He's like, come on, come on, man, he's drunk.

12:51.460 --> 12:52.900
But then the weird thing is,

12:52.900 --> 12:55.220
then he turned to the kid and go, shut the fuck up.

12:55.220 --> 12:56.060
What did I fucking tell you?

12:56.060 --> 12:56.900
Shut the fuck up.

12:56.900 --> 12:57.740
Fucking embarrassing.

12:57.740 --> 12:58.580
Shut the fuck up.

12:58.580 --> 12:59.420
Shut the fuck up.

12:59.420 --> 13:00.260
You shut up.

13:00.260 --> 13:01.100
I'm talking.

13:01.100 --> 13:01.940
You shut the fuck up.

13:01.940 --> 13:03.300
No, yeah.

13:03.300 --> 13:05.820
That was a burst that, you know, that was a half burst.

13:05.820 --> 13:06.660
And he would go full burst.

13:06.660 --> 13:08.180
And it happened like 20 times.

13:08.180 --> 13:09.020
But all the time.

13:09.020 --> 13:11.100
And the craziest part of it was that the only,

13:11.100 --> 13:13.860
he kept, no matter what topic came up,

13:13.860 --> 13:15.140
like, like, like, like,

13:15.140 --> 13:17.420
he didn't get the like conflict he wanted.

13:17.420 --> 13:19.540
So it would be like, I'd put my glass down

13:19.540 --> 13:21.580
on top of my laptop on the bar and he'd go like,

13:21.580 --> 13:23.020
you just got to put that there.

13:23.020 --> 13:26.380
And I'm like, yeah, I was like, you want,

13:26.380 --> 13:28.060
you want liquid on your laptop?

13:28.060 --> 13:29.580
And I'm like, yeah, I do.

13:29.580 --> 13:32.940
But it's aluminum, it's fine.

13:32.940 --> 13:35.100
And he's like, okay, man, all right.

13:35.100 --> 13:37.140
And it's like, okay, he cares about my laptop.

13:37.140 --> 13:37.980
That's a good start.

13:37.980 --> 13:40.540
And he's like, hey, man, you don't like night bowling?

13:40.540 --> 13:42.740
Yeah, so I was like, should we talk about bowling?

13:42.740 --> 13:43.740
We're like, we're like, Todd,

13:43.740 --> 13:46.060
he's trying to pick fights about bowling.

13:46.060 --> 13:47.980
And then, but then we're not going to fight him.

13:47.980 --> 13:48.900
So we're just like, like, like,

13:48.900 --> 13:50.100
we're just talking, we're just agreeing

13:50.100 --> 13:50.940
with him about bowling.

13:50.940 --> 13:51.980
And we're like, yeah, there used to be a lot

13:51.980 --> 13:53.140
of good bowling alleys around here.

13:53.140 --> 13:54.980
And he's like, yeah, then what happened?

13:54.980 --> 13:59.980
And McKenna goes, McKenna goes like, well, you know,

14:00.460 --> 14:01.940
like they were real bowling alleys.

14:01.940 --> 14:03.300
And now it's all that night bowling shit.

14:03.300 --> 14:05.420
And he's like, night bowling shit?

14:07.060 --> 14:09.740
And McKenna's like, yeah, you know, like,

14:09.740 --> 14:12.540
like everything's glow in the dark

14:12.540 --> 14:14.460
and there's like ecstasy music playing.

14:14.460 --> 14:15.300
And they're doing that.

14:15.300 --> 14:17.140
They're like three in the afternoon.

14:17.140 --> 14:19.220
And he's like, oh, it's like, and I was like,

14:19.220 --> 14:20.900
and then it's, you know, move on and go like,

14:20.900 --> 14:21.740
hey, what is this?

14:21.740 --> 14:23.020
What does somebody think of this napkin or something?

14:23.020 --> 14:25.620
But the guy kept focusing on McKenna and he's like,

14:25.620 --> 14:27.740
so you don't like night bowling, huh?

14:27.740 --> 14:29.860
It's like, yeah, something like that.

14:29.860 --> 14:33.980
What are the, what are you, you are the,

14:33.980 --> 14:37.100
if the idea is that this is threatening,

14:37.100 --> 14:39.740
your gang is the worst.

14:39.740 --> 14:41.860
And then the other guy would be all like, yeah, man,

14:41.860 --> 14:43.620
night bowling, it's like the balls are green.

14:43.620 --> 14:45.060
He's like, shut the fuck up, shut up.

14:45.060 --> 14:47.260
Shut the fuck up, shut the fuck up, shut the fuck up.

14:47.260 --> 14:48.580
You shut the fuck up, you shut the fuck up.

14:48.580 --> 14:50.420
You shut the conversation.

14:50.420 --> 14:52.180
I'm not, that's not an exaggeration.

14:52.180 --> 14:56.540
It was like the craziest like ventriloquist act turned,

14:56.540 --> 14:59.900
like some fucking weirdest shit.

15:01.820 --> 15:04.260
All right, yeah, I mean, there's nothing more to say about it.

15:04.260 --> 15:07.300
That was the whole incident, basically, yeah.

15:07.300 --> 15:11.500
And it's really hard to tell that story as funny as it is

15:11.500 --> 15:13.620
because we live in sensitive times and you don't want,

15:13.620 --> 15:15.940
you don't want old, old white fat Dan Harmon

15:15.940 --> 15:18.900
doing a fucking awesome Mexican accent and doing his impression

15:18.900 --> 15:22.540
of this guy is like, like, you know, as Donald Trump says,

15:22.540 --> 15:25.540
lots of them are wonderful people.

15:27.220 --> 15:29.420
And so many of them are probably listeners

15:29.420 --> 15:31.260
and I don't want them to hear me doing like

15:31.260 --> 15:34.420
some kind of fucking Jose Jimenez or whatever the, you know.

15:34.420 --> 15:37.420
It was, shut the fuck up, shut the fuck up, shut the fuck up.

15:37.420 --> 15:39.540
He was that archetype and he had that accent

15:39.540 --> 15:41.100
and he was like cut that silhouette

15:41.100 --> 15:45.260
and was like trying to like chest up about night bowling

15:45.260 --> 15:50.260
with Chris McKenna at three in the afternoon in Culver City

15:52.540 --> 15:53.940
next to a shuffleboard.

15:53.940 --> 15:55.380
McKenna's a big dude.

15:56.940 --> 15:59.780
Oh, they eventually they got the, they just like,

15:59.780 --> 16:01.700
I can't remember what the final topic was, but it was like,

16:01.700 --> 16:04.700
it was probably like McKenna didn't like Smurfs or something.

16:04.700 --> 16:07.220
It was, yeah, it was like, well, what's that supposed to mean?

16:07.220 --> 16:08.860
And McKenna's like, okay, come on.

16:08.860 --> 16:09.900
Like, that's enough.

16:09.900 --> 16:11.660
And then the bartender said, okay, guys get out of here.

16:11.660 --> 16:13.300
And then they just, they just did, they just like,

16:13.300 --> 16:15.420
yeah, they were nice about it.

16:15.420 --> 16:16.980
You don't like day drinking?

16:16.980 --> 16:22.380
Yeah, I mean, I wish, I wish you could like,

16:22.380 --> 16:24.700
like bring those guys in through a pneumatic tube

16:24.700 --> 16:27.140
and just like ask them questions like the,

16:27.140 --> 16:30.980
like the aliens in ID for you or something like,

16:30.980 --> 16:33.980
like just have a dialogue without there being any kind of

16:33.980 --> 16:36.620
resentment or anything, but just, just like,

16:36.620 --> 16:39.180
what, what, what do you want from us?

16:39.180 --> 16:42.900
You could fight, why, why about night bowling?

16:42.900 --> 16:45.180
There's so many things to fight about.

16:45.180 --> 16:46.900
I'll fight about anything.

16:47.900 --> 16:49.380
I was drunk.

16:49.380 --> 16:50.220
I don't know.

16:50.220 --> 16:52.340
You can feel, it was weird because you could feel like

16:52.340 --> 16:55.620
the socioeconomic like power structures at play

16:55.620 --> 16:58.220
and everyone was trying to like avoid around them

16:58.220 --> 16:59.860
and not get into like, you know,

16:59.860 --> 17:02.500
everyone was trying to tiptoe around everybody else,

17:02.500 --> 17:05.740
but that got everyone so stressed out that it came to a head.

17:05.740 --> 17:07.180
But you could like see it happening.

17:07.180 --> 17:08.820
It was just a bunch of car wrecks

17:08.820 --> 17:10.820
as people were trying to accommodate the other

17:10.820 --> 17:12.700
and then just not doing a great job of it.

17:12.700 --> 17:17.620
Yeah, it's like the, the, the 50s or 60s like scenario is

17:17.620 --> 17:22.620
totally unassuming minority person walks into a

17:24.100 --> 17:28.740
unfree white establishment and, and much to their shock,

17:28.740 --> 17:32.260
the white people are, are, are following some code

17:32.260 --> 17:34.020
that they now are finding out existed

17:34.020 --> 17:35.460
and it's very traumatic for them.

17:35.460 --> 17:36.860
And it's no better now.

17:36.860 --> 17:38.940
Now it's just as bad, except it's just like,

17:38.940 --> 17:42.180
it's all kind of like, it's like one person walking in

17:42.180 --> 17:43.780
and going, well, this is going to be bad.

17:43.780 --> 17:45.460
And then everyone at the bar going like,

17:45.460 --> 17:47.220
oh shit, we're all white, aren't we?

17:47.220 --> 17:52.220
Ah, ah, ah, don't think about it, don't think about it.

17:52.220 --> 17:54.500
And like everything getting so complicated

17:54.500 --> 17:57.660
that you're in an argument about, about pinballing.

17:58.660 --> 18:00.860
And every, but meanwhile everything's fine,

18:00.860 --> 18:02.860
but everyone's just worried.

18:02.860 --> 18:06.020
Anyways, let's, let's, let's, let's,

18:06.020 --> 18:07.540
let's make a new friend, shall we?

18:07.540 --> 18:08.620
I'd love to, Dan.

18:08.620 --> 18:11.940
But really an old soulmate, if you think about it,

18:11.940 --> 18:13.700
I was reading her book today.

18:13.700 --> 18:17.100
And yeah, her, her, her story is very, very interesting.

18:17.100 --> 18:19.300
So her latest book is sort of a memoir

18:19.300 --> 18:22.500
and takes you through the whole, her whole origin

18:22.500 --> 18:24.100
and, and everything.

18:24.100 --> 18:28.060
And like, I like, I also got, it got,

18:28.060 --> 18:31.620
it gets very like surprisingly kind of like revelatory,

18:31.620 --> 18:34.380
self-exploratory and like confessional.

18:35.660 --> 18:38.780
But it's also very, very, very lighthearted and adorable.

18:38.780 --> 18:40.140
But it's a, it's a, it's a good book.

18:40.140 --> 18:42.100
You should check it out.

18:42.100 --> 18:44.420
We'll let her talk about it and plug it and you can buy it

18:44.420 --> 18:45.780
cause I'll probably get the title wrong,

18:45.780 --> 18:49.340
even though I just read it, because I really listened to it.

18:49.340 --> 18:51.860
So it's just an arrow to me.

18:51.860 --> 18:54.340
Just go out to the store and buy the black arrow.

18:55.460 --> 18:59.380
It's four hours and 12 minutes at the speed 1.25.

19:00.500 --> 19:04.020
Please welcome someone who has never, ever called herself

19:04.020 --> 19:06.580
the queen of the nerds, but is called that

19:06.580 --> 19:08.660
by other people, Felicia Day.

19:08.660 --> 19:13.660
I think they like it when you sit near Jabba.

19:20.100 --> 19:20.940
Hello.

19:22.780 --> 19:24.420
Oh.

19:24.420 --> 19:25.260
All right.

19:25.260 --> 19:27.180
So I tell this to everybody, but it's, it's, it's,

19:27.180 --> 19:29.940
what you'll notice is it's five degrees hotter up here.

19:29.940 --> 19:31.420
So you can see me sweating.

19:31.420 --> 19:32.260
It's your beard.

19:32.260 --> 19:33.260
It's not because I'm fat.

19:33.260 --> 19:36.300
It's a, it's cooler out there.

19:36.300 --> 19:37.140
I would.

19:37.140 --> 19:37.980
Yeah. If you shaved your beard,

19:37.980 --> 19:39.060
it'd probably be a lot cooler.

19:39.060 --> 19:40.660
No, let me speak to that real quick.

19:40.660 --> 19:41.500
Oh shit.

19:42.340 --> 19:44.580
A beard is actually much like a heat sink

19:44.580 --> 19:48.860
where the face heat and sweat, it travels down the beard

19:48.860 --> 19:52.380
and dissipates, well, dissipate.

19:52.380 --> 19:53.220
It dissipate.

19:53.220 --> 19:56.140
Well, I mean, most people would call it dripping, but.

19:58.460 --> 20:00.700
I'm going to start coughing like a cat in a hair ball,

20:00.700 --> 20:02.780
which is the last thing you want to wake up to ever.

20:02.780 --> 20:03.620
Oh man.

20:04.940 --> 20:05.780
That thing.

20:05.780 --> 20:06.620
That's my alarm.

20:06.620 --> 20:07.460
Hi.

20:07.460 --> 20:08.300
You leap right off.

20:08.300 --> 20:09.140
All right.

20:09.140 --> 20:10.420
Felicia Day, thank you for coming.

20:10.420 --> 20:13.540
It's, it's, it's, it seems like overdue that you're here.

20:13.540 --> 20:14.620
To me, it does anyway.

20:14.620 --> 20:15.460
I don't know.

20:15.460 --> 20:16.300
I don't know what you think of.

20:16.300 --> 20:17.380
I mean, you invited me.

20:17.380 --> 20:18.220
I would have been here.

20:18.220 --> 20:20.460
I would have been here yesterday without an invite,

20:20.460 --> 20:21.540
which would have been creepy.

20:21.540 --> 20:22.380
Oh, okay.

20:22.380 --> 20:24.580
Cause I feel like I'm, I'm, I've always, I've always,

20:24.580 --> 20:27.500
you've always been out there on my radar, but I've always been.

20:27.500 --> 20:30.380
I mean, one thing that we will be talking about is how,

20:30.380 --> 20:31.780
I think we're both workaholics.

20:31.780 --> 20:34.380
I think you expounded on, I mean, you're definitely

20:34.380 --> 20:36.980
diagnosable and like had to, had to overcome it.

20:36.980 --> 20:37.820
Like I'm.

20:37.820 --> 20:38.660
Thanks, Dan.

20:38.660 --> 20:42.260
But I mean, you're also now, you've gotten past it.

20:42.260 --> 20:43.820
And I was like hearing your book and going like,

20:43.820 --> 20:46.620
I'm fucked up and I gotta, I'm not, I'm not through this.

20:46.620 --> 20:48.140
I've seen way more together in that book.

20:48.140 --> 20:50.300
Like I, just the other day I was like,

20:50.300 --> 20:51.820
well, you're not working on anything.

20:51.820 --> 20:52.780
Go ahead and die.

20:54.180 --> 20:56.180
So, I mean, it's still there, but at least I'm,

20:56.180 --> 20:59.460
I can acknowledge the fact that, oh, you're a workaholic.

20:59.460 --> 21:01.780
You should definitely go play Witcher.

21:01.780 --> 21:04.100
Because you're working on yourself.

21:04.100 --> 21:04.940
Right.

21:04.940 --> 21:08.500
My therapist says that when I'm playing Witcher,

21:08.500 --> 21:11.100
I'm actually just satisfying an addiction

21:11.100 --> 21:15.220
to the nervous system being like kind of stressed out.

21:15.220 --> 21:16.060
But I'm not.

21:16.060 --> 21:16.900
Is that true?

21:16.900 --> 21:18.700
I mean, she's not like anti-video game.

21:18.700 --> 21:19.620
Sounds like it.

21:19.620 --> 21:22.740
Well, I mean, it took her a long time to get there.

21:22.740 --> 21:24.900
Like she never said, stop playing video games.

21:24.900 --> 21:26.260
She's like, come on.

21:26.260 --> 21:28.420
Like, how, like, how come you're not relaxed

21:28.420 --> 21:29.420
after you play these things?

21:29.420 --> 21:31.500
Which is like, makes me think of my mom,

21:31.500 --> 21:33.300
like when you were 10 years old and you'd go like,

21:33.300 --> 21:34.980
god damn it, and your mom would call out

21:34.980 --> 21:36.180
from the other room like,

21:36.180 --> 21:38.660
why do you play a game that makes you so upset?

21:38.660 --> 21:43.660
Oh, cause, oh, cause you loved stick ball so much, you bitch.

21:49.340 --> 21:51.540
What, kick ball or stick ball?

21:51.540 --> 21:52.380
Shut up.

21:52.380 --> 21:54.580
You never speak perfectly either.

21:54.580 --> 21:56.580
I'm gonna get paid to do it one day.

21:56.580 --> 21:57.780
What, speak?

21:57.780 --> 21:58.620
Yeah.

21:59.660 --> 22:02.380
Okay, you can't even walk on a balance beam

22:02.380 --> 22:03.940
or use right-handed scissors.

22:05.940 --> 22:07.100
You use left-handed scissors?

22:07.100 --> 22:08.780
I had to, well, I can't use any scissors.

22:08.780 --> 22:09.620
I couldn't.

22:11.620 --> 22:13.540
My mom had to talk the principle

22:13.540 --> 22:15.820
into not holding me back in kindergarten.

22:15.820 --> 22:17.580
Oh, you're kidding, that happened to me.

22:17.580 --> 22:19.660
That happened to me the one year I actually went to school,

22:19.660 --> 22:21.660
they wanted to put me in the slow class

22:21.660 --> 22:32.860
because I held, I scissored toward myself.

22:32.860 --> 22:35.340
Because you're not supposed to be able to read

22:35.340 --> 22:36.660
at a college level.

22:40.340 --> 22:43.180
The tests have nothing to do with reading comprehension.

22:43.180 --> 22:45.140
They put you on a balance beam.

22:45.140 --> 22:45.980
What?

22:45.980 --> 22:47.500
That's like how you test a cat.

22:47.500 --> 22:48.340
Oh.

22:49.940 --> 22:50.940
What does that have to do?

22:50.940 --> 22:54.220
Oh, this person's gonna need to balance?

22:54.220 --> 22:55.380
Another thing that happened to me,

22:55.380 --> 22:58.140
I had only vivid memories from the one year I went to school

22:58.140 --> 23:00.340
and then I was sequestered for the rest of my life,

23:00.340 --> 23:02.420
which we'll talk about.

23:02.420 --> 23:03.540
There was a girl named Jennifer

23:03.540 --> 23:06.500
and she was balancing on the balance beam

23:06.500 --> 23:08.500
because we had a thing we had to do.

23:08.500 --> 23:11.380
Bitch poked me in the eye with her nail

23:11.380 --> 23:15.500
and I had to be a pirate for two years in a row at Halloween.

23:15.500 --> 23:20.180
Was this during the, was this a high stakes balancing thing?

23:20.180 --> 23:22.380
I don't, no, it was some, you know,

23:22.380 --> 23:24.700
we all knew we had to like show the teacher

23:24.700 --> 23:26.100
that we were gonna go across the tires.

23:26.100 --> 23:27.580
So we were like, let's study

23:27.580 --> 23:29.340
because that was what we were calling back then.

23:29.340 --> 23:30.940
You could have been Rooster Cogburn.

23:30.940 --> 23:32.500
You didn't have to be a pirate.

23:32.500 --> 23:34.340
Thank you.

23:34.340 --> 23:35.420
Or Snake Plisken.

23:35.420 --> 23:36.260
True grit.

23:36.260 --> 23:37.780
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

23:37.780 --> 23:39.780
Well, I was just telling the story last week

23:39.780 --> 23:41.740
about when I went to daycare

23:41.740 --> 23:43.420
and a girl stick a crayon in my mouth

23:43.420 --> 23:46.500
and I was just a distinct memory of the violation,

23:46.500 --> 23:48.420
the poking, the probing.

23:48.420 --> 23:49.540
What color was it?

23:49.540 --> 23:50.940
It was red.

23:50.940 --> 23:51.780
Ew.

23:51.780 --> 23:52.940
She was trying to play lipstick.

23:52.940 --> 23:53.940
I think she had a crush on me.

23:53.940 --> 23:55.180
I gave her that credit.

23:55.180 --> 23:56.260
Okay.

23:56.260 --> 23:57.180
Listen to the episode.

23:57.180 --> 23:58.020
It's great.

23:58.020 --> 24:01.620
But so since we're there,

24:01.620 --> 24:03.460
I mean you keep saying the one year I went to school

24:03.460 --> 24:05.180
because like, I don't know

24:05.180 --> 24:07.220
if I've ever met a homeschooled person.

24:07.220 --> 24:10.220
Like, and I certainly wouldn't picture them as like, you know,

24:10.220 --> 24:12.580
even though I think one of the stereotypes is like

24:12.580 --> 24:15.580
that they're not, they're more, they're, they're,

24:15.580 --> 24:18.140
they're capable, they're capable,

24:18.140 --> 24:22.220
but you know, but you know, you know, yeah,

24:22.220 --> 24:24.900
I wouldn't, I wouldn't guess like, oh, homeschooled,

24:24.900 --> 24:25.740
but, but yeah, I mean,

24:25.740 --> 24:26.580
You don't like homeschooled?

24:26.580 --> 24:27.420
You don't like homeschooled?

24:27.420 --> 24:29.220
You don't like homeschooled?

24:29.220 --> 24:30.060
Shut the fuck up.

24:30.060 --> 24:31.540
Shut the fuck up.

24:31.540 --> 24:32.380
I can shut up.

24:39.380 --> 24:42.780
But your, your mom, your mom pulled you

24:42.780 --> 24:45.540
and your brother out of school when you were kids

24:45.540 --> 24:48.620
because, and it's because you, you were hoisted

24:48.620 --> 24:51.580
by your own petard, as we say on this show.

24:52.500 --> 24:56.020
Petards are special pants made of pride.

24:58.020 --> 25:00.220
I'll explain later, but the, you, you,

25:00.220 --> 25:01.580
there's some, sorry, like, like,

25:01.580 --> 25:03.500
because it was like a paroch, it was like a,

25:03.500 --> 25:05.100
We went, we moved to Mississippi.

25:05.100 --> 25:07.340
So we were from Alabama, which was already a problem.

25:07.340 --> 25:10.420
And then we were moving to the Gulf Coast of Mississippi,

25:10.420 --> 25:13.020
which was a big problem because that was Hickville

25:13.020 --> 25:14.780
to the people in Alabama.

25:14.780 --> 25:17.420
So that was Sub Hickville.

25:17.420 --> 25:18.980
And then my mom was concerned

25:18.980 --> 25:21.500
because all my family is very highly educated

25:21.500 --> 25:24.980
and it was like the worst school system in the world.

25:24.980 --> 25:27.260
So she was like, let's call one place.

25:27.260 --> 25:28.340
They make you wear uniforms.

25:28.340 --> 25:30.380
Nope, you're not going to school.

25:30.380 --> 25:31.860
That was, it's, that's it.

25:31.860 --> 25:32.700
Yeah.

25:32.700 --> 25:35.380
Literally what she did.

25:35.380 --> 25:38.100
But in your, in your mom did a, you know,

25:38.100 --> 25:40.260
the kind of job I think we all picture ourselves doing

25:40.260 --> 25:43.140
as we tried to teach our kids in homes, as homeschooling.

25:43.140 --> 25:46.580
The beginning of the day slipped to around Nunesh and,

25:46.580 --> 25:47.420
Yeah.

25:47.420 --> 25:49.860
She ordered all these like, it's called Calvert School

25:49.860 --> 25:52.580
and it's what missionaries use to teach their children.

25:52.580 --> 25:55.140
And they literally come in just white books,

25:55.140 --> 25:59.660
kind of like the, the, the generic cereal at the grocery.

25:59.660 --> 26:01.420
Why are you creepily taking pictures of me?

26:01.420 --> 26:02.260
Don't worry.

26:02.260 --> 26:03.100
Don't worry.

26:03.100 --> 26:03.940
You don't like photos?

26:03.940 --> 26:08.300
You don't like photography?

26:09.580 --> 26:10.740
Weird angle.

26:10.740 --> 26:11.580
Anyway.

26:11.580 --> 26:12.420
That's good, trust me.

26:12.420 --> 26:15.380
No, that sounds broken.

26:17.380 --> 26:18.580
I'll post it on Instagram.

26:18.580 --> 26:19.420
You'll see.

26:19.420 --> 26:20.260
It's a cool photo.

26:20.260 --> 26:21.340
He is, he is a good photographer.

26:21.340 --> 26:22.180
Filter it up.

26:22.180 --> 26:23.020
Um, yeah.

26:23.020 --> 26:24.980
So anyway, she, she, she ordered all these books

26:24.980 --> 26:26.340
and we were like, yeah, learning.

26:26.340 --> 26:30.580
And then she never woke up like before noon.

26:30.580 --> 26:32.900
So I would be like, well, I'm going to educate myself.

26:32.900 --> 26:34.700
So I would have a strict regiment of like

26:34.700 --> 26:36.180
lost in spaces at 10 a.m.

26:36.180 --> 26:38.980
You better do three math problems before then.

26:38.980 --> 26:41.140
And I felt like, yeah, I'm really educating myself.

26:41.140 --> 26:44.580
Like that, that was the totality of my childhood.

26:44.580 --> 26:48.220
Basically programming myself around old noir films,

26:48.220 --> 26:51.140
musicals, old science fiction things,

26:51.140 --> 26:54.980
and then eating buffalo wings at the TGI Fridays.

26:54.980 --> 26:56.900
And at one point you're like a violin prodigy

26:56.900 --> 26:58.500
and that's like actually you're, you're, you're,

26:58.500 --> 27:00.580
you're one of these kids that's in college

27:00.580 --> 27:02.940
at the age of 16 or whatever, which is like,

27:02.940 --> 27:05.340
like worms are in Revenge of the Nerds.

27:05.340 --> 27:08.340
The, but what, what, how old were you when this,

27:08.340 --> 27:12.020
this weird chapter happened where your mom

27:12.020 --> 27:14.460
was grooming you to be the new Selena?

27:14.460 --> 27:15.740
Okay, it's true.

27:15.740 --> 27:16.580
Okay.

27:18.580 --> 27:21.820
It was such a strange like flash.

27:21.820 --> 27:23.700
I mean, we were living in San Antonio

27:23.700 --> 27:25.500
and that's the heart of, of Tejano.

27:25.500 --> 27:27.900
So I don't know why you would think it would be inappropriate.

27:27.900 --> 27:32.900
I mean, I don't speak Spanish or sing or speak Spanish

27:34.140 --> 27:35.940
or any of the things that you need to do

27:35.940 --> 27:38.100
to be a Tejano star, but that does not,

27:38.100 --> 27:39.860
my mom's the kind of person who will,

27:39.860 --> 27:42.140
well, first of all, she, I just found out the other day

27:42.140 --> 27:44.180
that she crashed a car into somebody in Austin

27:44.180 --> 27:45.340
and immediately got out of the car

27:45.340 --> 27:47.180
and was like, I'm Felicia Day's mother.

27:49.180 --> 27:50.900
And it actually worked.

27:50.900 --> 27:53.740
It worked situationally in Austin,

27:53.740 --> 27:54.580
but then it got-

27:54.580 --> 27:55.420
Because she hit Wil Wheaton.

27:55.420 --> 27:56.260
Yeah.

28:01.260 --> 28:03.620
Who is just driving around your mom's neighborhood.

28:03.620 --> 28:08.620
With Steve's camera, but no, she's the kind of person

28:10.060 --> 28:12.340
who we would go, when she would eventually wake up,

28:12.340 --> 28:16.140
we would go into the mall for hours while she browsed

28:16.140 --> 28:18.420
and we would sit inside the merry-go-round of shame.

28:18.420 --> 28:20.020
You know, you just get in there as kids

28:20.020 --> 28:22.020
and you're like, just twirl the clothes around me

28:22.020 --> 28:22.980
and I'll be in a different place.

28:22.980 --> 28:24.060
Please God.

28:24.060 --> 28:25.900
But she would tell the Clinique sales woman

28:25.900 --> 28:28.820
about my pirouettes and I would be forced to do pirouettes

28:28.820 --> 28:31.700
to everybody in the makeup department at like 9 p.m.

28:31.700 --> 28:35.020
So this is, I mean, she's very enthusiastic with my abilities.

28:35.020 --> 28:36.540
So whenever she met somebody

28:36.540 --> 28:38.940
who could possibly make me more of a star,

28:38.940 --> 28:40.220
she would glom on to them

28:40.220 --> 28:42.380
and one of them happened to be a Tejano producer

28:42.380 --> 28:45.220
who had a garage that he recorded music in.

28:45.220 --> 28:47.660
And therefore that was like a door opening

28:47.660 --> 28:52.340
to my star happening as a Tejano singer,

28:52.340 --> 28:55.980
which is kind of an accordion Hispanic Tex-Mex music

28:55.980 --> 28:57.780
if you're not familiar with Tejano.

28:57.780 --> 28:59.140
It's very jolly.

28:59.140 --> 29:02.260
And not to get grim, but in the book,

29:02.260 --> 29:05.900
the closer on that chapter is that then,

29:05.900 --> 29:07.220
was it Selena that she got?

29:07.220 --> 29:09.220
Selena, she got tragically was.

29:09.220 --> 29:10.060
She was not happy.

29:10.060 --> 29:10.900
Yeah.

29:10.900 --> 29:13.660
But like, I mean, I don't know were you like,

29:13.660 --> 29:16.060
was that really the reason why it kind of came to a close?

29:16.060 --> 29:16.900
Oh no, yes.

29:16.900 --> 29:18.460
She thought it was dangerous at that point

29:18.460 --> 29:21.140
because Selena's manager murdered her.

29:21.140 --> 29:22.420
No, this is a terrible story.

29:22.420 --> 29:24.780
It's like, have you played Life is Strange?

29:24.780 --> 29:25.620
The video game?

29:25.620 --> 29:27.620
I actually did play like a couple levels of it.

29:27.620 --> 29:29.700
Yeah, so I don't want to spoil anything,

29:29.700 --> 29:33.060
but some deep stuff happens involving like assault.

29:33.060 --> 29:36.420
And why did you?

29:36.420 --> 29:37.780
That's crazy shit, man.

29:41.540 --> 29:43.260
Anyway, so I'm streaming it.

29:43.260 --> 29:46.620
And I'm like, oh my god, she was date raped.

29:46.620 --> 29:48.100
So I'm like laughing uncomfortably,

29:48.100 --> 29:49.980
which I'm doing right now, too, because I'm sweating,

29:49.980 --> 29:52.180
but I'm talking about that in any jovial way.

29:52.180 --> 29:53.500
And can we change the subject?

29:53.500 --> 29:53.980
Yeah.

29:53.980 --> 29:55.220
OK.

29:55.220 --> 29:56.500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

29:56.500 --> 29:58.740
But oh, is that, I wonder if that's the thing that people,

29:58.740 --> 30:00.260
yeah, I didn't know the game went there.

30:00.260 --> 30:02.460
I stopped playing it because I was like, this is girl shit.

30:02.460 --> 30:06.100
But I enjoyed it for a little while.

30:06.100 --> 30:07.100
You don't like feelings?

30:07.100 --> 30:08.940
I knew it was, I knew I was making a joke.

30:08.940 --> 30:10.260
I knew it was girl shit when I bought it.

30:10.260 --> 30:11.820
I mean, there's a girl that says Life is Strange.

30:11.820 --> 30:13.100
It doesn't have an explosion on it.

30:13.100 --> 30:15.340
And I was like, this is girl shit in a good way.

30:15.340 --> 30:16.460
I'm 42.

30:16.460 --> 30:18.820
I'm the equivalent of a girl when I'm playing video games.

30:18.820 --> 30:23.540
So I'm not 15.

30:23.540 --> 30:26.940
I don't want to get on a headset and yell anti-Semitic things

30:26.940 --> 30:28.820
at people that may or may not be Jewish.

30:32.340 --> 30:34.420
And I thought it was really, really interesting, that gimmick

30:34.420 --> 30:36.460
that they, because that's how we've always played games,

30:36.460 --> 30:38.020
is that you save your place and then you go back.

30:38.020 --> 30:40.020
And the way that they made it part of the narrative was.

30:40.020 --> 30:42.260
Yeah, you can rewind time and be able to.

30:42.260 --> 30:44.300
Well, did you ever play, well, I could talk about video games

30:44.300 --> 30:45.940
all day, but Brayd has also, did you ever

30:45.940 --> 30:48.660
play that because you could rewind time?

30:48.660 --> 30:49.700
No, what did you watch?

30:49.700 --> 30:52.620
Yeah, Brayd, it was kind of one of the first big Indie

30:52.620 --> 30:54.540
games, Brayd, yeah.

30:54.540 --> 30:56.660
And I think he has a new game coming out just very soon,

30:56.660 --> 30:58.140
but after like seven years.

30:58.140 --> 31:01.020
But Brayd, it's kind of like a more, not really Mario,

31:01.020 --> 31:04.980
but it's Mario-ish in that those are the kind of levels,

31:04.980 --> 31:06.980
but you have to be able to rewind time to actually get

31:06.980 --> 31:07.900
through the levels.

31:07.900 --> 31:09.660
So it's a thinky game.

31:09.660 --> 31:11.940
It's a hipster game, which is, I'm not putting it in.

31:11.940 --> 31:15.340
Well, OK, so a little bit more about hipster video games.

31:15.340 --> 31:19.420
Did you play the Juno and Green Lantern?

31:19.420 --> 31:25.100
Yeah, the hard rain sequel, the heavy rain, what the fuck?

31:25.100 --> 31:27.140
Oh, it's like, no, oh, Beyond Two Souls?

31:27.140 --> 31:27.700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

31:27.700 --> 31:29.180
No, that was not good.

31:29.180 --> 31:31.620
You didn't like that?

31:31.620 --> 31:32.580
Oh, I don't know.

31:32.580 --> 31:34.580
No, I don't think that makes you a bad person.

31:34.580 --> 31:36.820
I'm like, oh, I really enjoyed that,

31:36.820 --> 31:39.140
and I hated the rain game.

31:39.140 --> 31:39.980
I didn't like, yeah.

31:39.980 --> 31:42.260
I thought it was so dumb, and it was the exact same mechanics,

31:42.260 --> 31:44.420
but it was like, oh, they figured it out this time,

31:44.420 --> 31:47.460
because I was enjoying being Juno and having a psychic friend

31:47.460 --> 31:51.420
and coming of age, and the lowest of all of them.

31:51.420 --> 31:52.620
That was not a girl game?

31:52.620 --> 31:55.940
No, I was obviously being glib when I said girl game.

31:55.940 --> 31:57.300
I'm like, I know who I'm talking to,

31:57.300 --> 32:00.580
and the fact that half of the point of this interview

32:00.580 --> 32:04.380
and your career has been that there is no.

32:04.380 --> 32:05.020
Ladies play games.

32:05.020 --> 32:07.420
The irony being, and we were going

32:07.420 --> 32:11.660
to get to this eventually, that you're describing

32:11.660 --> 32:14.780
your early life, which is very, very parallel to mine.

32:14.780 --> 32:16.820
You're experienced with this new technology

32:16.820 --> 32:18.900
when we're at that age.

32:18.900 --> 32:21.820
You and I were both the first people

32:21.820 --> 32:23.860
that we ever held hands with or kissed,

32:23.860 --> 32:25.980
were people that we met on computers.

32:25.980 --> 32:32.620
And back then, ironically, there was way more,

32:32.620 --> 32:37.260
there was less bubbling fury.

32:37.260 --> 32:39.140
There was a more welcoming, more equal world

32:39.140 --> 32:40.580
gender-wise back then.

32:40.580 --> 32:43.300
I think because it was nerds against the world,

32:43.300 --> 32:47.620
and now that it's so ironic that all this time later,

32:47.620 --> 32:52.260
that there's so much more of this division.

32:52.260 --> 32:55.020
We didn't even, I mean, it officially became a division,

32:55.020 --> 32:59.220
like a cultural division, which is so odd.

32:59.220 --> 33:00.660
But I guess it's not odd when you've

33:00.660 --> 33:03.340
realized that the technology turned mainstream.

33:03.340 --> 33:06.700
And so back then, it was like, you had to be, you know.

33:06.700 --> 33:07.620
You had to make efforts.

33:07.620 --> 33:10.620
You had to get that modem to dial at the camera.

33:10.620 --> 33:13.540
Yeah, and if you were the kind of person that was capable of

33:13.540 --> 33:16.620
having that much hatred of anybody,

33:16.620 --> 33:20.700
you were probably better at football than, like, you know,

33:20.700 --> 33:22.860
probably you landed on that side of the bubble.

33:22.860 --> 33:24.180
And we're like, I'll just play football.

33:24.180 --> 33:25.020
This shit's hard.

33:25.020 --> 33:27.100
Like, you know, dial up a phone.

33:27.100 --> 33:29.140
And that's like, well, my mom needs to use it.

33:29.140 --> 33:31.500
Well, I tried to get one of those hacker, you know,

33:31.500 --> 33:33.340
I don't know, it's a, there's a hacker magazine,

33:33.340 --> 33:34.620
2600 or something like that.

33:34.620 --> 33:36.740
I remember trying to get one of those.

33:36.740 --> 33:38.580
And I'm like, I'm going to be a hacker.

33:38.580 --> 33:39.900
I was like, they're the coolest.

33:39.900 --> 33:43.100
And I, or involved like opening, like shimming up a

33:43.100 --> 33:45.460
telephone line and opening it and knowing wires.

33:45.460 --> 33:47.740
And I was like, I guess I'll just play the game.

33:47.740 --> 33:51.700
Wait, you went up an actual in real life.

33:51.700 --> 33:54.660
No, in the, well, no, they were like, basically in that,

33:54.660 --> 33:57.300
in that magazine, which I think is still going on,

33:57.300 --> 34:00.300
that they would really show you how to hack phone lines.

34:00.300 --> 34:01.140
Oh yeah, yeah.

34:01.140 --> 34:01.980
In order to-

34:01.980 --> 34:02.820
Freaking.

34:02.820 --> 34:03.660
Yes, with a P.

34:03.660 --> 34:04.500
Long distance freaking.

34:04.500 --> 34:05.340
Freaking.

34:05.340 --> 34:06.340
I did that successfully a bunch.

34:06.340 --> 34:07.660
Did you really?

34:07.660 --> 34:09.540
Yeah, I wasn't, I didn't earn it,

34:09.540 --> 34:11.860
but I just like, I got codes and numbers and things.

34:11.860 --> 34:15.860
And I tried, I used it till I call places and not get

34:15.860 --> 34:16.700
charged.

34:16.700 --> 34:19.900
And I called like naughty, naughty things that,

34:19.900 --> 34:21.900
that charge you, but didn't get charged.

34:21.900 --> 34:22.740
Cause I used like this code.

34:22.740 --> 34:23.580
So you called sex lines?

34:23.580 --> 34:25.300
I, I just, I see.

34:25.300 --> 34:27.580
How old, how old were you?

34:27.580 --> 34:29.460
Dan, how old were you when you were doing this?

34:29.460 --> 34:30.300
39.

34:35.500 --> 34:36.340
I don't know.

34:36.340 --> 34:38.780
It was probably like 15 or something, 14.

34:38.780 --> 34:40.220
You didn't pay these women?

34:41.220 --> 34:42.140
They weren't even women.

34:42.140 --> 34:43.060
They were recordings.

34:43.060 --> 34:43.900
I will, yeah.

34:43.900 --> 34:46.260
I was not like, I'm going to talk to a lady.

34:46.260 --> 34:47.100
Like.

34:47.100 --> 34:47.940
I don't know how it works.

34:47.940 --> 34:48.780
I did that.

34:48.780 --> 34:49.980
I don't even know, I don't know either.

34:49.980 --> 34:50.820
Cause I tried it once.

34:50.820 --> 34:52.940
I was just like, oh man, all these like 900 numbers

34:52.940 --> 34:54.460
that are about sex and stuff.

34:54.460 --> 34:56.020
And I was like, but, and I was like, oh,

34:56.020 --> 34:59.100
so can you use these numbers, like this system to like

34:59.100 --> 35:00.780
call one of those things and not get charged?

35:00.780 --> 35:02.540
And I tried it and it was just like,

35:02.540 --> 35:04.380
you very quickly found out that it was just,

35:04.380 --> 35:05.380
you know, it's just garbage.

35:05.380 --> 35:07.500
Like they're just trying to trick people into paying for

35:07.500 --> 35:10.740
what is like a big long message, you know, hang up.

35:10.740 --> 35:12.700
Well, if you want some hot, juicy action,

35:12.700 --> 35:14.180
why don't you press three?

35:14.180 --> 35:16.060
And I'm like, okay, I'll take it hot, juicy.

35:16.060 --> 35:18.580
And then like, and it was just like,

35:18.580 --> 35:19.860
like, like recordings after a while.

35:19.860 --> 35:21.940
I was just like a woman, like there's like a recording

35:21.940 --> 35:23.860
of a woman going like, late at night,

35:23.860 --> 35:26.860
I like to wear my bathrobe and I hope my man comes home

35:26.860 --> 35:27.700
and gives it to me.

35:27.700 --> 35:30.060
Oh, like, it was just, and it was just like

35:30.060 --> 35:31.100
a shitty recording.

35:31.100 --> 35:32.460
Like it was all like.

35:32.460 --> 35:33.300
It's still pretty hot.

35:33.300 --> 35:34.140
You figured it out.

35:34.140 --> 35:35.980
Cause I abandoned it the minute I bought one.

35:35.980 --> 35:37.180
Well, and then I never did it again.

35:37.180 --> 35:38.140
I was like, okay, there's that.

35:38.140 --> 35:39.580
And who am I going to call in Hong Kong?

35:39.580 --> 35:43.300
Like, but I wanted to be like Matthew Broderick, obviously.

35:43.300 --> 35:44.500
And of course everybody did.

35:44.500 --> 35:47.660
Or like a William Gibson that you try to read that you say,

35:47.660 --> 35:48.900
oh yeah, I read that what you did.

35:48.900 --> 35:49.860
No, I didn't read.

35:49.860 --> 35:50.700
Yeah.

35:50.700 --> 35:52.860
So it was all Matthew Broderick and Albert from

35:52.860 --> 35:55.020
little house of the prairie and that whiz kids show.

35:55.020 --> 35:56.300
Remember whiz kids?

35:56.300 --> 35:57.140
Oh my God.

35:57.140 --> 35:57.980
I didn't want to watch whiz kids.

35:57.980 --> 35:59.700
It lasted like 13 episodes and it was like, you know,

35:59.700 --> 36:02.060
at the height of that stuff is like Max Gale

36:02.060 --> 36:06.100
for who was Wojahowicz from Barty Miller played a cop

36:06.100 --> 36:08.380
who would go to this whiz kid.

36:08.380 --> 36:10.780
It was just a total, like it was just taking war games

36:10.780 --> 36:12.460
and saying, okay, let's make a TV show.

36:12.460 --> 36:17.460
So it was like a good natured cop going to a analog

36:17.540 --> 36:20.780
for Matthew Broderick's character in fucking

36:20.780 --> 36:22.460
not the producers war games.

36:24.180 --> 36:26.060
That would be a different show.

36:26.060 --> 36:26.900
And there was like a cute,

36:26.900 --> 36:29.300
there was a cute Allie Sheedy type that was like his tomboy

36:29.300 --> 36:33.060
kind of like hoodie, hoodie wearing for a friend,

36:33.060 --> 36:35.100
friend, platonic friend.

36:35.100 --> 36:36.220
Yes.

36:36.220 --> 36:37.860
Until the time where she put a dress on you.

36:37.860 --> 36:39.460
He was like, whoa.

36:39.460 --> 36:41.660
I mean, what do you mean I have to wear a dress

36:41.660 --> 36:45.380
and let my hair down in order to get this microchip

36:45.380 --> 36:46.340
from the dance.

36:47.180 --> 36:51.460
God, no, no, no, he would hack his refrigerator.

36:51.460 --> 36:52.980
Like they would show him,

36:52.980 --> 36:55.460
this is how magical people thought computers were.

36:55.460 --> 36:58.940
They would show him like typing in his bedroom

36:58.940 --> 37:02.980
and then in the kitchen, his refrigerator would open

37:02.980 --> 37:04.460
and his mom would go, oh,

37:04.460 --> 37:06.020
and he'd go, sorry, mom.

37:08.420 --> 37:11.860
He's just hacking the refrigerator to open.

37:11.860 --> 37:13.860
And then he would like hack traffic lights

37:13.860 --> 37:16.020
and hack like, you know, he just hack everything.

37:16.020 --> 37:18.140
But I just read the other day that you could hack a car

37:18.140 --> 37:20.540
now because the onboard computers are so complicated

37:20.540 --> 37:23.100
that you could actually hack a car and drive it for somebody.

37:23.100 --> 37:25.700
Yeah, that's how they killed Michael Hastings.

37:25.700 --> 37:26.660
What?

37:26.660 --> 37:27.620
Yep.

37:27.620 --> 37:29.580
The government killed Michael Hastings

37:29.580 --> 37:34.740
because he got too close to the truth.

37:34.740 --> 37:38.180
I remember this.

37:38.180 --> 37:40.540
I mean, yeah, what did he do?

37:40.540 --> 37:42.500
He just did a lot of really, you know,

37:42.500 --> 37:45.460
really reaching journalism that put a, you know,

37:46.540 --> 37:48.460
revealed a lot of corruption in a defense.

37:48.460 --> 37:49.620
Oh, was that by Moza?

37:49.620 --> 37:51.060
The guy who died by Moza?

37:51.060 --> 37:52.420
Yeah, no, that's the guy.

37:52.420 --> 37:55.220
And it was the big, you know, the big burnt patch of grass.

37:55.220 --> 37:56.340
I know, I saw that.

37:56.340 --> 38:01.100
Yeah, the government released a statement that said,

38:01.100 --> 38:03.620
Michael Hastings definitely was not killed

38:03.620 --> 38:07.060
by a hacked computer or hackers hacking his computer.

38:07.060 --> 38:11.060
But just as a completely unrelated public safety note,

38:11.060 --> 38:13.540
if you were hacked, if your computer is hacked

38:13.540 --> 38:17.140
and you were killed, it would look exactly like this.

38:17.140 --> 38:19.420
I would reiterate that it is completely.

38:19.420 --> 38:21.740
They actually said something along those lines.

38:21.740 --> 38:23.300
It's like, this is what it would look like

38:23.300 --> 38:24.500
if your car was hacked.

38:24.500 --> 38:26.140
It would explode like this.

38:26.140 --> 38:27.300
It didn't happen.

38:27.300 --> 38:28.940
There'd be no way to know if it happened,

38:28.940 --> 38:30.700
but we know it didn't happen.

38:30.700 --> 38:32.820
So it's just like the most weird,

38:32.820 --> 38:35.420
the most suspicious thing anyone could do.

38:35.420 --> 38:37.300
If you're out there and you're close to the truth,

38:37.300 --> 38:38.860
maybe get a little further from it.

38:38.860 --> 38:40.700
That's all we're saying.

38:40.700 --> 38:41.660
Yeah.

38:41.660 --> 38:43.820
This guy got too close to a telephone pole.

38:43.820 --> 38:45.260
You stay away from the truth.

38:45.260 --> 38:46.540
Stay away from your refrigerator

38:46.540 --> 38:48.980
because somebody might be able to hack it.

38:48.980 --> 38:50.100
So anyways, back then,

38:50.100 --> 38:52.300
sorry, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue.

38:52.300 --> 38:55.660
The big plot point of your career

38:55.660 --> 38:57.380
is World of Warcraft,

38:57.380 --> 38:59.020
because obviously,

38:59.020 --> 39:00.780
or maybe not obviously for people listening,

39:00.780 --> 39:03.380
like your community,

39:05.060 --> 39:06.140
the weird metric to use.

39:06.140 --> 39:07.820
But I'm narcissistic, so I'm reading a book

39:07.820 --> 39:09.460
and I'm only understanding it through parallels

39:09.460 --> 39:12.020
through my life, which is happening at the same time.

39:12.020 --> 39:14.700
The world's shittiest biopic would be like cutting back

39:14.700 --> 39:16.060
and forth between what's going on with you

39:16.060 --> 39:17.380
and what's going on with me.

39:17.380 --> 39:18.980
And we don't know each other,

39:18.980 --> 39:19.820
but it's like, I don't know.

39:19.820 --> 39:21.260
There would be no reason to do it

39:21.260 --> 39:23.300
other than the fact that it structurally works out

39:23.300 --> 39:24.660
really perfectly.

39:24.660 --> 39:26.780
Because it's like, during season four,

39:26.780 --> 39:31.060
it was interesting reading it.

39:31.060 --> 39:36.060
But your community is based on your community college,

39:36.260 --> 39:38.980
which is you experiencing World of Warcraft,

39:38.980 --> 39:40.700
and you got seriously like,

39:40.700 --> 39:42.180
I was surprised at your description

39:42.180 --> 39:44.620
of how hard the addiction was.

39:44.620 --> 39:45.660
And it sounds on paper,

39:45.660 --> 39:47.020
just as you're describing in one line,

39:47.020 --> 39:48.700
like video game addiction.

39:48.700 --> 39:51.340
First of all, you have a tendency to laugh it off

39:51.340 --> 39:53.060
because it seems like a silly thing to be addicted to.

39:53.060 --> 39:55.300
Second of all, with the extent that you do start

39:55.300 --> 39:56.460
to take it seriously,

39:56.460 --> 39:59.180
you would therefore then lose all respect for the game.

39:59.180 --> 40:01.460
But you weave those highway cones

40:01.460 --> 40:03.460
because you're like, this is fucking serious shit.

40:03.460 --> 40:05.100
Like I, my life got,

40:05.100 --> 40:06.500
because it started as a great thing

40:06.500 --> 40:07.780
that made you feel good.

40:07.780 --> 40:09.660
Like at a low time in your life,

40:09.660 --> 40:12.900
you were like, you were already trying to act

40:12.900 --> 40:14.260
and doing these auditions,

40:14.260 --> 40:16.300
and you're sort of,

40:16.300 --> 40:18.620
you're not actually expressing yourself,

40:18.620 --> 40:21.580
you're not close to the truth with your art.

40:21.580 --> 40:24.380
And then you start playing World of Warcraft

40:24.380 --> 40:25.620
and it starts putting you in a good mood

40:25.620 --> 40:26.820
and you start feeling like

40:26.820 --> 40:28.660
you actually are on honest ground.

40:28.660 --> 40:31.100
And then all of a sudden it kind of takes over your life

40:31.100 --> 40:32.540
and you stop going on an auditions

40:32.540 --> 40:34.220
and you stop doing everything.

40:34.220 --> 40:36.180
And you described it like in a way that made me go,

40:36.180 --> 40:37.220
oh wow, this is real.

40:37.220 --> 40:38.060
Cause I mean, I do have,

40:38.060 --> 40:40.460
I do have friends who the World of Warcraft,

40:40.460 --> 40:43.900
like, like, like, like took them out,

40:43.900 --> 40:47.900
took them off the grid of life.

40:47.900 --> 40:52.900
Yeah, I mean, it was, I mean, I've seen that happen.

40:54.060 --> 40:55.660
Obviously it happened to me,

40:55.660 --> 40:57.740
but I wanted to, in my, I didn't want,

40:57.740 --> 40:58.700
I hate it when people are like,

40:58.700 --> 41:01.100
oh, the inherent nature of that video game

41:01.100 --> 41:02.340
will ruin a person's life.

41:02.340 --> 41:03.660
Cause I think that's bullshit.

41:03.660 --> 41:07.260
And it's a simple excuse for people's problems.

41:07.260 --> 41:08.580
You could say it about pudding or,

41:08.580 --> 41:10.420
Exactly.

41:10.420 --> 41:11.260
A pudding at it.

41:11.260 --> 41:12.100
I mean, I don't,

41:12.100 --> 41:13.300
Or night bowling.

41:13.300 --> 41:14.220
Night bowling?

41:14.220 --> 41:17.140
It's really awesome.

41:18.140 --> 41:19.780
But to me, you know, I was,

41:19.780 --> 41:22.700
I mean, the irony was when I was actually making a living

41:22.700 --> 41:24.020
as an actor, a great living.

41:24.020 --> 41:26.020
Like you can work four or five days a year

41:26.020 --> 41:28.020
and you're a commercial actor and you can make,

41:28.020 --> 41:29.340
you can have a great career.

41:29.340 --> 41:30.700
You make enough money to live

41:30.700 --> 41:32.860
and then you have no fulfillment in between.

41:32.860 --> 41:34.580
And you can only take so many classes

41:34.580 --> 41:36.460
or go to coffee with so many actors

41:36.460 --> 41:37.740
and complain about your agents

41:37.740 --> 41:40.300
before you feel like, oh, this is not working for me.

41:40.300 --> 41:41.220
This isn't doing anything good.

41:41.220 --> 41:43.780
So my brother invited me to play World of Warcraft

41:43.780 --> 41:47.340
and I was like, whoa, I'm a warlock

41:47.340 --> 41:49.380
and I'm good at this guys.

41:49.380 --> 41:51.420
And it turned into this thing

41:51.420 --> 41:54.340
where I was getting a sense of fulfillment inside

41:54.340 --> 41:56.900
by just playing more and more and more.

41:56.900 --> 41:59.020
And I don't think it's inherently bad.

41:59.020 --> 42:02.100
And I think there, if you can moderate your behavior

42:02.100 --> 42:04.860
that it's an amazing social and justifiable

42:04.860 --> 42:05.980
social outlet for you.

42:05.980 --> 42:08.860
And increasingly, as we have these online worlds

42:08.860 --> 42:10.620
that are as important as our offline worlds,

42:10.620 --> 42:12.980
you can't denigrate somebody's online life

42:12.980 --> 42:15.180
as being escapism or destructive

42:15.180 --> 42:18.140
because we're all gonna be living in a void one day.

42:18.140 --> 42:20.580
We're all gonna be staring at the construction

42:20.580 --> 42:21.980
of our walls that we want to,

42:21.980 --> 42:24.980
which in my case will be probably a Normandy castle

42:24.980 --> 42:26.380
with some fairy servants.

42:26.380 --> 42:29.860
And we're all gonna be walled off into these gardens

42:29.860 --> 42:31.060
and whether that's good or bad.

42:31.060 --> 42:34.300
Like, to me, I think that sense of fulfillment

42:34.300 --> 42:36.580
that I got connecting to actual people

42:36.580 --> 42:39.540
behind those other characters was very important to me.

42:39.540 --> 42:41.220
And I will always treasure those friendships

42:41.220 --> 42:43.660
and those raids and those clothing items

42:43.660 --> 42:46.660
that I won on the raids and helmets and things like that.

42:46.660 --> 42:48.900
But the problem was I didn't have anything to do with my life

42:48.900 --> 42:51.340
and I didn't know what to do to get out of the mire

42:51.340 --> 42:53.740
of the acting and to get ahead.

42:53.740 --> 42:56.140
Because as you said, I went to college really early.

42:56.140 --> 42:58.380
I was a straight A student and I was like,

42:58.380 --> 43:00.300
I don't know where else to work hard

43:00.300 --> 43:02.900
to get ahead in this business because it's not merit based.

43:02.900 --> 43:06.340
And so I just, you know, World of Warcraft is merit based.

43:06.340 --> 43:08.500
I was a potion master, you know?

43:08.500 --> 43:11.860
What does rock bottom look like in a World of Warcraft addiction?

43:11.860 --> 43:15.500
I mean, I remember a couple examples from your book.

43:15.500 --> 43:18.420
I mean, it definitely looks like having,

43:18.420 --> 43:19.860
I mean, I'm a very organized person.

43:19.860 --> 43:21.980
I love to-do lists, but I would make a to-do list

43:21.980 --> 43:23.820
about what I needed to do in the morning

43:23.820 --> 43:26.380
to do World of Warcraft better.

43:26.380 --> 43:28.940
So I would literally have a strict like 8.15,

43:28.940 --> 43:31.180
you need to wake up and have a coffee

43:31.180 --> 43:33.540
and then log on by 8.30 so you could do

43:33.540 --> 43:35.500
a half hour of farming of Dreamfoil.

43:35.500 --> 43:38.620
And then you have to commute from Ash, you know, Ashara

43:38.620 --> 43:41.460
to whatever other region is to get the other herb.

43:41.460 --> 43:42.900
And then you have to start this herb.

43:42.900 --> 43:44.460
And I would literally like list it out.

43:44.460 --> 43:45.900
I had a very comprehensive,

43:45.900 --> 43:50.020
I would have been a really good WoW secretary for anybody.

43:50.020 --> 43:53.380
But you also described your internet going out

43:53.380 --> 43:55.540
and you driving around in your car crying

43:55.540 --> 43:56.820
because the internet was out.

43:56.820 --> 43:59.620
Yeah, yes, that happened too.

43:59.620 --> 44:02.180
And yeah, so all those things kind of added up to

44:02.180 --> 44:04.620
like having two, three characters and, you know,

44:04.620 --> 44:06.900
playing 12, 14 hours a day and then going to sleep,

44:06.900 --> 44:08.700
dreaming of being a cartoon character

44:08.700 --> 44:09.980
and then waking up with an agenda

44:09.980 --> 44:11.340
to be more cartoon characters.

44:11.340 --> 44:14.500
And it was inherent in just a place that I was in life

44:14.500 --> 44:19.220
that I used that as sort of a balm to fill the hours

44:19.220 --> 44:21.100
that I didn't know what else to do with

44:21.100 --> 44:23.300
because I didn't know how to be fulfilled otherwise.

44:23.300 --> 44:27.340
So, I mean, I got out of it because I got in a support group

44:27.340 --> 44:28.180
which is terrible.

44:28.180 --> 44:30.700
I hate saying that word, it's just so dorky.

44:30.700 --> 44:32.340
Based on the secret, which is even worse.

44:32.340 --> 44:37.340
But anyway, it actually got me, shut up, Steve.

44:39.340 --> 44:40.300
I feel ya.

44:40.300 --> 44:41.540
Remember the secret?

44:42.500 --> 44:43.500
I do.

44:43.500 --> 44:44.620
Nope.

44:44.620 --> 44:46.700
Yeah, of course, it wasn't that long ago.

44:46.700 --> 44:48.620
It was, it feels like, I'm saying that.

44:48.620 --> 44:49.980
It was like five to six years ago.

44:49.980 --> 44:51.140
Six years ago.

44:51.140 --> 44:53.820
Yeah, and so basically I had this group of women

44:53.820 --> 44:55.820
who were like, hey, come out and share your victories

44:55.820 --> 44:57.460
every week and my only victory was like,

44:57.460 --> 45:00.780
I leveled, got a new helm and they were like,

45:00.780 --> 45:02.380
I don't understand this, this gaming.

45:02.380 --> 45:03.740
And you justified that by saying you're gonna

45:03.740 --> 45:06.620
write a pilot about that world and you eventually did.

45:06.620 --> 45:08.580
Like you have a valley in there where you're like,

45:08.580 --> 45:10.220
you're like, this addiction is more,

45:10.220 --> 45:12.180
it's not like you're going from the joy of World of Warcraft

45:12.180 --> 45:13.260
to writing a pilot about it.

45:13.260 --> 45:15.500
It's like, wow, I mean, like you're like,

45:15.500 --> 45:16.340
bottoming out.

45:16.340 --> 45:17.540
You're like a junkie on World of Warcraft,

45:17.540 --> 45:19.700
but then you get out of it by stopping playing it

45:19.700 --> 45:21.300
and writing about it instead.

45:21.300 --> 45:23.180
And as you write this pilot,

45:23.180 --> 45:26.420
and then like you and your friends from that group

45:26.420 --> 45:27.940
based on the secret, like.

45:27.940 --> 45:29.020
I mean, it was tangentially,

45:29.020 --> 45:31.100
I did not know it was based on the secret.

45:31.100 --> 45:32.820
They read like the back cover of the secret

45:32.820 --> 45:33.820
and said, you can do whatever you want.

45:33.820 --> 45:34.980
And they're like, let's form a group then.

45:34.980 --> 45:38.620
Okay, no, no, don't say, was that really the truth?

45:38.620 --> 45:40.700
Because that would be even sadder.

45:40.700 --> 45:42.060
No, I didn't know it was on the,

45:42.060 --> 45:44.060
I think it was just tangential in the forming of the group

45:44.060 --> 45:47.540
before I was there and I don't mean to, now I'm sweating.

45:47.540 --> 45:48.780
Anyway, so it was fine.

45:48.780 --> 45:51.060
It was four or five ladies and every week we'd get together

45:51.060 --> 45:52.820
and I wrote the script and nobody wanted to make it

45:52.820 --> 45:53.660
because they were like,

45:53.660 --> 45:55.260
I don't understand how you use a computer

45:55.260 --> 45:57.460
to talk to other people with a game

45:57.460 --> 45:59.580
because that was seven, eight years ago

45:59.580 --> 46:03.660
and people were not that savvy

46:03.660 --> 46:05.100
and YouTube had just started.

46:05.100 --> 46:07.380
So my friend was like, let's shoot it and put it online.

46:07.380 --> 46:10.100
And that was literally the start of everything I've done.

46:10.100 --> 46:12.180
Just kind of braving the terror

46:12.180 --> 46:14.060
and deciding to pick up a camera and shoot.

46:14.060 --> 46:15.260
Yeah, and you hunkered down

46:15.260 --> 46:17.340
and like the description of the shit,

46:17.340 --> 46:20.460
the amount of work that you guys put into that thing.

46:20.460 --> 46:23.300
Well, not accepting help from a system that was like,

46:23.300 --> 46:27.140
well, we'll do this, but we'll own it all and stuff

46:27.140 --> 46:30.300
and you repeatedly kept resisting that urge

46:30.300 --> 46:32.340
and we're really one of the first,

46:32.340 --> 46:34.340
I mean, because this is back again,

46:34.340 --> 46:37.620
another, you know, I'm going like, I remember then,

46:37.620 --> 46:39.660
I wasn't paying any attention to what you were doing.

46:39.660 --> 46:41.860
I had my head on my own ass, but it was channel 101.

46:41.860 --> 46:42.700
It's like.

46:42.700 --> 46:44.540
I did a couple of those like randomly

46:44.540 --> 46:46.420
and I thought that was, I mean,

46:46.420 --> 46:48.300
but I never would be, I acted in a couple,

46:48.300 --> 46:50.340
but I never would have been brave enough to pick it up

46:50.340 --> 46:52.900
because I didn't have any experience filmmaking, you know?

46:52.900 --> 46:55.100
I mean, what you did was like revolutionary

46:55.100 --> 46:58.140
and that it was internet video before internet video

46:58.140 --> 46:58.980
was a thing, right?

46:58.980 --> 46:59.820
Thank you.

46:59.820 --> 47:01.700
Yeah.

47:01.700 --> 47:03.220
Channel 101 predated YouTube,

47:03.220 --> 47:05.500
but then you're doing this in like a slightly post YouTube

47:05.500 --> 47:07.020
world, but it's like, it's all the beginning.

47:07.020 --> 47:10.340
And like certainly the idea of a web series, like now,

47:10.340 --> 47:11.340
I mean, y'all rocked my favorite.

47:11.340 --> 47:12.860
That's what called the cards is.

47:12.860 --> 47:14.140
Of course, about the guilt.

47:14.140 --> 47:14.980
Yeah.

47:14.980 --> 47:15.820
Yeah.

47:15.820 --> 47:16.660
Oh, thank you.

47:16.660 --> 47:17.500
We haven't said it.

47:17.500 --> 47:18.340
Yeah.

47:18.340 --> 47:19.180
My web series is about the guilt.

47:19.180 --> 47:20.020
It was called the Gild.

47:20.020 --> 47:20.860
The Gild.

47:20.860 --> 47:23.460
But yeah, the Yacht Rock was one of my favorite things

47:23.460 --> 47:24.300
in the world.

47:24.300 --> 47:27.940
Like, it's truly a masterpiece of cinema.

47:27.940 --> 47:28.940
Thank you.

47:28.940 --> 47:31.420
It does.

47:31.420 --> 47:32.260
We were in that.

47:32.260 --> 47:34.540
We were in it.

47:34.540 --> 47:35.460
DeMorge was in it.

47:35.460 --> 47:38.380
But the guilt lasted six seasons?

47:38.380 --> 47:38.980
Six years.

47:38.980 --> 47:40.260
It was six years of videos.

47:40.260 --> 47:41.380
And we actually weren't on YouTube

47:41.380 --> 47:42.420
except for the first season.

47:42.420 --> 47:44.220
So we shot the first three episodes

47:44.220 --> 47:46.820
and I tell in traumatic detail about shooting in your house,

47:46.820 --> 47:49.340
which is not a fun thing because people will go number

47:49.340 --> 47:51.020
two in your toilet copiously.

47:51.020 --> 47:53.340
And then you'll have to clean it later,

47:53.340 --> 47:54.860
which is I'm a hypochondriac.

47:54.860 --> 47:58.140
I don't want anybody else's poop in my house.

47:58.140 --> 48:01.780
And I have to say that that's the one chapter where it was

48:01.780 --> 48:07.780
like, she lost me because of my channel 101 background.

48:07.780 --> 48:10.620
I'm like, I'm like, I would not with not thinking

48:10.620 --> 48:12.380
that you're a bad person, but just thinking like,

48:12.380 --> 48:14.340
oh, no, we might have not been friends or something

48:14.340 --> 48:15.060
if we had encountered it.

48:15.060 --> 48:17.340
Because I'm like, yeah, I left a Diet Coke can

48:17.340 --> 48:18.420
under your couch mattress.

48:18.420 --> 48:22.220
I fucking, I was a boom operating for eight hours.

48:22.220 --> 48:23.260
It's your show.

48:23.260 --> 48:24.620
OK, listen, I was trying.

48:24.620 --> 48:25.260
I had to read.

48:25.260 --> 48:27.420
That was actually the hardest chapter to write

48:27.420 --> 48:30.500
because I wrote it because I don't know if you,

48:30.500 --> 48:32.140
you start to believe your own mythology

48:32.140 --> 48:35.220
or you're just so used to telling people about the story.

48:35.220 --> 48:37.340
And I was so grateful and I was like,

48:37.340 --> 48:39.900
I would list every single person who came for free.

48:39.900 --> 48:41.820
And my editor was like, this is not good.

48:41.820 --> 48:43.580
Like no one, I understand that you

48:43.580 --> 48:46.420
want to thank the Kenny, who is your podcaster, who

48:46.420 --> 48:48.060
showed up to set every single day.

48:48.060 --> 48:50.020
And you know, and all these other people

48:50.020 --> 48:52.980
that you're listing who volunteered, Colleen and Bob,

48:52.980 --> 48:55.540
who were furries and they donated their furry costumes

48:55.540 --> 48:59.260
to see that by like, and I would go in copious lists of trying

48:59.260 --> 49:00.180
to thank everybody.

49:00.180 --> 49:01.500
And then in that chapter, she was like,

49:01.500 --> 49:02.420
you have to be funnier.

49:02.420 --> 49:04.060
So that was why I took the angle.

49:04.060 --> 49:06.900
And yes, the Coke can ring on my dining room table

49:06.900 --> 49:10.780
pisses me off because I had to do like a monk guest star

49:10.780 --> 49:15.820
to pay for that table because I was going to go to Ikea.

49:15.820 --> 49:17.260
But I was like, oh, I got a guest star.

49:17.260 --> 49:19.260
I could get a table, a real lady table.

49:19.260 --> 49:24.300
So that's ironic because monk doesn't, he doesn't,

49:24.300 --> 49:28.700
he's like, Sherlock Holmes, but he hates soda rings

49:28.700 --> 49:29.700
on the table.

49:29.700 --> 49:30.860
He's like, you didn't use a coaster.

49:30.860 --> 49:31.740
You murdered him.

49:31.740 --> 49:33.140
And they're like, no, I didn't.

49:33.140 --> 49:35.020
He's like, who are you going to believe?

49:35.020 --> 49:36.820
I'm a monk.

49:36.820 --> 49:39.140
I've never seen the show.

49:39.140 --> 49:39.660
You got it.

49:39.660 --> 49:41.420
You nailed it.

49:41.420 --> 49:46.060
But well, I agree with your publisher who ever said that

49:46.060 --> 49:51.940
because it's a couple of pages or 20 minutes of audio

49:51.940 --> 49:55.180
during which I'm like, well, come on.

49:55.180 --> 49:57.540
Who cares if someone uses a coaster?

49:57.540 --> 50:00.700
But it's important because you're planning the seats there

50:00.700 --> 50:05.820
because this turns out to be a very actually needlessly,

50:05.820 --> 50:07.580
because it could have been a good book anyway,

50:07.580 --> 50:10.900
like you're a likable person and you're sharing your story

50:10.900 --> 50:12.220
and people want to hear it.

50:12.220 --> 50:16.380
But you really crucify yourself as it goes.

50:16.380 --> 50:18.300
You walk all the way up Golgotha with this

50:18.300 --> 50:22.260
and it starts with diet Coke rings on the table,

50:22.260 --> 50:24.260
but you're taking that somewhere and you're

50:24.260 --> 50:27.460
very, very confessional and thorough about chronically

50:27.460 --> 50:28.460
a nervous breakdown.

50:28.460 --> 50:30.460
Yeah, which started way earlier than I would've

50:30.460 --> 50:34.460
would've thought and not before I wrote about my story.

50:34.460 --> 50:37.340
Well, you used the word panic attack from the beginning.

50:37.340 --> 50:39.260
And I was like, I wonder if she means real panic attacks

50:39.260 --> 50:41.580
or if she's a, but.

50:41.580 --> 50:42.420
Oh, no, real ones.

50:42.420 --> 50:43.820
Like I can remember vividly.

50:43.820 --> 50:47.100
I auditioned for, and it was actually when I kind of broke

50:47.100 --> 50:48.300
away from acting and it was just like,

50:48.300 --> 50:49.780
I'm going to do the web thing for a while.

50:49.780 --> 50:52.420
I was testing for a show called like Samantha Who,

50:52.420 --> 50:54.220
which was a Christina Applegate show.

50:54.220 --> 50:57.180
And it was me testing against Melissa McCarthy

50:57.180 --> 50:58.180
and an Asian girl.

50:58.180 --> 51:00.020
And I was like, and it was Melissa McCarthy

51:00.020 --> 51:02.060
before she was Melissa McCarthy.

51:02.060 --> 51:02.900
And.

51:02.900 --> 51:03.740
It's when she was just Asian.

51:03.740 --> 51:04.580
Yeah.

51:04.580 --> 51:07.260
It's weird, she had a lot of surgery.

51:07.260 --> 51:08.580
It's interesting.

51:08.580 --> 51:10.420
I mean, her community came down on her so hard

51:10.420 --> 51:12.980
about that surgery, but it turned out it made her a superstar.

51:12.980 --> 51:14.700
It really did.

51:14.700 --> 51:16.420
They always say, don't get the surgery.

51:16.420 --> 51:19.340
Be true to yourself, except don't in Hollywood.

51:19.340 --> 51:21.380
But I went in and I tested for that.

51:21.380 --> 51:24.660
And I literally had such a panic attack that I could not.

51:24.660 --> 51:26.300
I mean, my hand was, I'm not kidding.

51:26.300 --> 51:28.700
It was the most, and when I had a panic attack,

51:28.700 --> 51:31.380
and I noticed, you know, in going through a lot of therapy

51:31.380 --> 51:33.060
and stuff like that, like, oh, you were plagued

51:33.060 --> 51:34.420
with panic attacks your whole life.

51:34.420 --> 51:36.460
And out of body, like kind of looking like, wow,

51:36.460 --> 51:37.300
you're terrible.

51:37.300 --> 51:39.980
Like I could see what you're doing and it's not effective.

51:39.980 --> 51:41.980
And it was so bad.

51:41.980 --> 51:44.220
The audition, I walked out, and it was the most ashamed

51:44.220 --> 51:45.780
I've ever felt in my whole entire life.

51:45.780 --> 51:47.220
And at that point, I was just like,

51:47.220 --> 51:51.820
I think I need to back off and just do the web more.

51:51.820 --> 51:53.340
But I don't know where I was going with this.

51:53.340 --> 51:54.340
It was very traumatic.

51:54.340 --> 51:55.220
Oh, the panic attack.

51:55.220 --> 51:56.900
It's the guilt that starts to consume you.

51:56.900 --> 51:58.580
Ironically, you create this thing.

51:58.580 --> 52:03.100
And again, I relate to this, like you're

52:03.100 --> 52:06.980
at the height of your, you know, your story goes

52:06.980 --> 52:08.300
from a meeting with the goddess, which

52:08.300 --> 52:10.620
is like Comic-Con and you're hanging out with Joss Whedon.

52:10.620 --> 52:13.100
And you're like, I can't believe I built myself

52:13.100 --> 52:14.180
without permission.

52:14.180 --> 52:15.580
You use the phrase without permission.

52:15.580 --> 52:17.580
And so it's like, yeah, exactly.

52:17.580 --> 52:19.580
I did this without permission.

52:19.580 --> 52:23.860
And then the second half starts to take.

52:23.860 --> 52:27.940
Because if you haven't checked in about this compulsion,

52:27.940 --> 52:30.460
this engine, like, if the whole time everyone's just going,

52:30.460 --> 52:31.780
like, go, get them, go, get them.

52:31.780 --> 52:33.860
And you're the whole time, you have these little ghosts

52:33.860 --> 52:34.460
in your head.

52:34.460 --> 52:36.900
So then you start to get with nothing else

52:36.900 --> 52:38.180
to destroy you but yourself.

52:38.180 --> 52:40.100
You start to destroy yourself, kind of, like.

52:40.100 --> 52:40.860
A little bit, yeah.

52:40.860 --> 52:42.740
I mean, you know, essentially, I mean,

52:42.740 --> 52:44.340
we were shooting for six seasons.

52:44.340 --> 52:45.620
And it seems like, oh, you're so successful.

52:45.620 --> 52:46.660
I mean, we were successful.

52:46.660 --> 52:48.020
We had a little bit of a budget.

52:48.020 --> 52:50.260
But essentially, we were making extremely low budget

52:50.260 --> 52:52.540
movie in my house for six years.

52:52.540 --> 52:55.340
I was the only writer to ever write on the Guild.

52:55.340 --> 52:57.180
And it was so, and not only with that,

52:57.180 --> 52:59.140
that I did all the social media, all the marketing, all

52:59.140 --> 53:00.780
the appearances, all the coordination.

53:00.780 --> 53:03.420
I mean, I would be on the phone, like, trying to get the cast

53:03.420 --> 53:04.940
to a convention.

53:04.940 --> 53:05.700
Like, where are you?

53:05.700 --> 53:07.220
OK, I'll go meet you outside with a badge.

53:07.220 --> 53:11.180
Like, there was no possible way to delegate in my behavior,

53:11.180 --> 53:13.100
as well as just not having resources.

53:13.100 --> 53:14.300
I mean, we had no resources.

53:14.300 --> 53:16.700
So it looks like we got fancier every year.

53:16.700 --> 53:18.940
But when we did, because everybody's expectation was

53:18.940 --> 53:21.500
higher, but we really had no more resources or support

53:21.500 --> 53:22.460
to make it bigger.

53:22.460 --> 53:25.100
And basically, I did it by just literally working myself

53:25.100 --> 53:27.340
almost to death.

53:27.340 --> 53:29.300
And I would never trade that for anything.

53:29.300 --> 53:33.300
But I don't know if it was the most healthy way to do things,

53:33.300 --> 53:35.900
because when I started adding other things on,

53:35.900 --> 53:37.580
like a company and other projects,

53:37.580 --> 53:39.540
like, that's when I really started to collapse.

53:39.540 --> 53:43.900
Yeah, so I guess I haven't collapsed yet,

53:43.900 --> 53:47.060
but I don't know if I'm going to, like, because, yeah,

53:47.060 --> 53:49.300
then I was like, then the parallel stopped,

53:49.300 --> 53:51.220
because you're like, oh, I figured this out.

53:51.220 --> 53:53.740
And I'm like, wait, how did you figure that out?

53:53.740 --> 53:56.140
Because you're like, because the doctors said, like,

53:56.140 --> 53:58.140
you're getting a horrible heartburn that

53:58.140 --> 54:00.580
could put you at heightened risk of esophageal cancer.

54:00.580 --> 54:02.740
And you're like, well, wait a minute, that's my deal breaker.

54:02.740 --> 54:04.660
I'm not going to affect my, I'll be crazy,

54:04.660 --> 54:06.220
but I'm not going to let it affect my body.

54:06.220 --> 54:08.300
So then you just decided to stop being crazy.

54:08.300 --> 54:09.580
And I'm like, what?

54:09.580 --> 54:12.220
I mean, I just not, if I'm afraid to do like that,

54:12.220 --> 54:14.540
I'm definitely still crazy.

54:14.540 --> 54:16.500
What you said that I can't understand

54:16.500 --> 54:20.220
is that you realize that the, I don't know, paraphrasing you,

54:20.220 --> 54:24.940
but you realize that the things you do are not who you are.

54:24.940 --> 54:27.460
I mean, that is a realization that I intellectually

54:27.460 --> 54:28.300
understand.

54:28.300 --> 54:30.100
And sometimes I feel it in my heart.

54:30.100 --> 54:31.820
But I don't know, especially if you're

54:31.820 --> 54:34.020
a business where you are something to someone

54:34.020 --> 54:35.460
that you're not somebody.

54:35.460 --> 54:38.260
Like if you're in a position where somebody knows you,

54:38.260 --> 54:42.060
and that's fame, and what small amount that I have

54:42.060 --> 54:44.980
in very interesting areas, but like the minute you

54:44.980 --> 54:49.140
are in a situation where your work is basically

54:49.140 --> 54:51.420
in that kind of external validation

54:51.420 --> 54:54.460
is important to getting what you want done,

54:54.460 --> 54:56.060
I think that starts to mess with your head

54:56.060 --> 54:58.580
and your value starts to kind of like be sucked out

54:58.580 --> 55:00.900
onto your skin, your outer self.

55:00.900 --> 55:03.140
I don't know, is that weird?

55:03.140 --> 55:04.140
What?

55:04.140 --> 55:06.060
I've taken it too weird for me in this area.

55:06.060 --> 55:09.140
I mean, I don't know, like I'm a full blown, like,

55:09.140 --> 55:11.420
I didn't know, because my therapist just

55:11.420 --> 55:13.060
starts to use this word workaholic,

55:13.060 --> 55:16.380
and I'm like, well, doesn't that mean productive?

55:16.380 --> 55:21.380
Like I'm not, and it doesn't, it doesn't,

55:21.380 --> 55:25.580
anymore than alcoholic means like, you know, a fun drunk

55:25.580 --> 55:28.700
or, you know, it's like you can be something a holic,

55:28.700 --> 55:31.580
and it doesn't have to be like a super great version of it.

55:31.580 --> 55:32.860
And I guess I've always, I'm like,

55:32.860 --> 55:34.660
this is a serious problem for me,

55:34.660 --> 55:36.580
like that I have to confront now,

55:36.580 --> 55:38.380
that's like the root of everything

55:38.380 --> 55:39.500
that's going wrong in my life.

55:39.500 --> 55:40.500
What are you doing?

55:40.500 --> 55:41.900
I just, I'm just, I don't have,

55:41.900 --> 55:44.580
I don't have an identity outside of what I do at all.

55:44.580 --> 55:48.700
Like this show is a huge part of keeping me sane

55:48.700 --> 55:53.700
because it's a way for me to do something

55:54.020 --> 55:59.020
while that involves being human and fulfilling myself.

55:59.020 --> 56:02.820
But like, so like, because I don't, I don't,

56:02.820 --> 56:04.980
you know, I play, like sort of my therapist,

56:04.980 --> 56:07.020
she's like, what do you do to recharge?

56:07.020 --> 56:08.380
What do you do to fill up?

56:08.380 --> 56:10.460
What do you do to relax as I play video games?

56:10.460 --> 56:12.580
And she's like, okay, so what do you do in the video games?

56:12.580 --> 56:15.420
And I go, whoa, you know, I'm like a witcher and a,

56:15.420 --> 56:18.020
I mean, yeah, there's a lot of shit to be solved there.

56:18.020 --> 56:19.500
These peasants are really put upon.

56:19.500 --> 56:21.020
And she's like, so how is that different?

56:21.020 --> 56:24.980
If the ghoul is a guy from DreamWorks,

56:24.980 --> 56:28.780
how is this different from the life

56:28.780 --> 56:30.420
you just described that's incredibly stressful?

56:30.420 --> 56:32.860
And I was like, well, okay, I guess that you're right.

56:32.860 --> 56:35.700
That would make a good movie.

56:35.700 --> 56:38.140
I don't think that's a good comparison though,

56:38.140 --> 56:39.060
because it's like.

56:39.060 --> 56:40.500
You have you met this guy from DreamWorks?

56:40.500 --> 56:44.900
Well, I'm just saying sports, sports are very intense.

56:44.900 --> 56:47.060
You could get really worked up and stressed out

56:47.060 --> 56:49.060
just playing sports, but no one would say,

56:49.060 --> 56:50.540
you gotta stop playing sports, man.

56:50.540 --> 56:51.380
It's cutting into you.

56:51.380 --> 56:54.140
Well, I think that those people exert themselves.

56:54.140 --> 56:56.780
And also there are probably people

56:56.780 --> 56:58.700
who shouldn't be using sports

56:58.700 --> 57:00.340
because it does stress them out.

57:00.340 --> 57:04.020
But I think that typically people who do physical things,

57:04.020 --> 57:06.620
they exert themselves and then they physically,

57:06.620 --> 57:08.340
like have a catharsis, you know?

57:08.340 --> 57:10.620
Because they wear themselves out and then they go,

57:10.620 --> 57:13.580
and they have no choice but to take those big deep breaths

57:13.580 --> 57:15.700
and relax themselves and set their nervous system

57:15.700 --> 57:16.700
back to zero.

57:16.700 --> 57:19.340
But where I don't, because I know she's right

57:19.340 --> 57:22.420
because I know for a fact that when I'm sitting down

57:22.420 --> 57:25.220
to play a video game, I'm absolutely,

57:25.220 --> 57:26.820
I can't wait to do it.

57:26.820 --> 57:29.060
So you would, so then you think, oh, I'm doing this

57:29.060 --> 57:30.820
to take a break or relax.

57:30.820 --> 57:34.420
But I'm just, like, I'm just using it to avoid,

57:34.420 --> 57:35.260
like I'm using it to-

57:35.260 --> 57:36.260
But what else are you gonna do?

57:36.260 --> 57:37.860
That's a valid code to do.

57:37.860 --> 57:38.700
I mean, like-

57:38.700 --> 57:39.540
That's what I'm saying.

57:39.540 --> 57:40.380
I get pissed off.

57:40.380 --> 57:41.300
I'm like, okay, therapist, what do you do?

57:41.300 --> 57:43.340
You watch The Good Wife every night?

57:43.340 --> 57:45.220
Ah, well-

57:45.220 --> 57:48.980
I mean, how was that better than actually participating

57:48.980 --> 57:51.140
in a story and projecting yourself

57:51.140 --> 57:53.500
as a really hot minor witcher?

57:53.500 --> 57:55.500
If I said that, my therapist would say,

57:55.500 --> 57:57.980
well, I curl up in the, I don't watch TV

57:57.980 --> 57:59.180
and I don't use Facebook.

57:59.180 --> 58:01.220
I curl up in the arms of my lesbian wife

58:01.220 --> 58:02.780
and I'd be like, I wrote it.

58:02.780 --> 58:07.780
She probably really does like watch sunsets and shit.

58:10.260 --> 58:11.740
I mean, how is that better?

58:11.740 --> 58:13.300
Listen, I mean-

58:13.300 --> 58:14.740
Well, because it's two lesbians doing it.

58:14.740 --> 58:15.580
First of all.

58:15.580 --> 58:17.100
Okay, well-

58:17.100 --> 58:18.940
So how is it worse?

58:18.940 --> 58:21.900
I mean, I think that if you find a sense of meaning

58:21.900 --> 58:24.420
in something, and yes, sometimes you just want

58:24.420 --> 58:27.340
a little bit of emptiness, like that's what TV's about.

58:27.340 --> 58:30.020
Well, I think the difference is it's like stimulation

58:30.020 --> 58:32.580
versus like coffee's a stimulant.

58:32.580 --> 58:35.660
And then pot like kind of makes you giggle and fall asleep.

58:35.660 --> 58:36.780
Like I think that-

58:36.780 --> 58:39.140
But she just wants you to have more lesbian pot.

58:39.140 --> 58:43.340
Yeah, yeah, that's the scissoring thing, right?

58:43.340 --> 58:47.860
The, I think she's, I think it's accurate.

58:47.860 --> 58:49.780
I mean, I wouldn't, I wouldn't, I wouldn't,

58:49.780 --> 58:51.580
I wouldn't, if there wasn't some truth

58:51.580 --> 58:53.380
to what she was saying, like I wouldn't believe it,

58:53.380 --> 58:55.140
but I fit, because I'm miming like

58:55.140 --> 58:57.180
an Xbox controller in my hand, and I'm like,

58:57.180 --> 58:59.940
I, it's like, I was like, oh, I'm gonna,

58:59.940 --> 59:01.140
now I'm gonna do this, because it's like,

59:01.140 --> 59:04.460
I wanna like, I wanna jump over to doing the same thing,

59:04.460 --> 59:05.780
but numb my brain.

59:05.780 --> 59:08.100
I don't, I'm not like taking in,

59:08.100 --> 59:10.140
I'm not like refilling my soul.

59:10.140 --> 59:11.700
But what is-

59:11.700 --> 59:12.660
I don't know how you do that.

59:12.660 --> 59:13.780
I don't know how you do that.

59:13.780 --> 59:15.500
I don't, I mean, I think it's relative.

59:15.500 --> 59:17.060
Like what, are you supposed to learn French?

59:17.060 --> 59:18.980
Or go to, go to meet friends?

59:18.980 --> 59:21.700
I find it so ponderous to go out,

59:21.700 --> 59:22.820
if there's not a point to it.

59:22.820 --> 59:23.660
Yeah, I mean, I-

59:23.660 --> 59:25.580
Like if we're not playing board games or bowling,

59:25.580 --> 59:27.340
I don't understand how I'm just supposed to sit there

59:27.340 --> 59:29.300
with a drink in my hand and talk,

59:29.300 --> 59:32.180
more than 30 minutes, I don't know.

59:32.180 --> 59:33.020
I don't know either.

59:33.020 --> 59:33.860
Should I see your therapist?

59:33.860 --> 59:34.700
Do you wanna see her?

59:34.700 --> 59:35.540
Yeah, let's talk to her.

59:35.540 --> 59:36.380
I don't know, now I'm sweating,

59:36.380 --> 59:38.580
because maybe I do want a step than I thought.

59:38.580 --> 59:40.220
Can I, can I, can I just bring you in,

59:40.220 --> 59:42.860
in like a box, and, and she'll be like,

59:42.860 --> 59:43.700
what's in the box?

59:43.700 --> 59:44.540
I'm like, just some more work.

59:44.540 --> 59:45.940
And she goes, mm, workaholic,

59:45.940 --> 59:46.940
still playing those video games.

59:46.940 --> 59:48.940
And we're like, yeah, tell me what you were saying

59:48.940 --> 59:49.780
before again.

59:49.780 --> 59:51.460
And she's like, mm, you gotta,

59:51.460 --> 59:53.860
you gotta hang out with your wife and just watch a sunset.

59:53.860 --> 59:57.180
And then I'll open the box and you'll be like, hello.

59:57.180 --> 59:58.220
Hello, I have an opinion about this.

59:58.220 --> 59:59.420
I got a bone to pick.

01:00:00.980 --> 01:00:03.340
If I were playing video games, I would honestly be,

01:00:03.340 --> 01:00:06.500
I would be, I would, I would think that I don't feel alive

01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:07.940
if I was not learning something.

01:00:07.940 --> 01:00:10.260
So I would be like, I'm learning French or Esperanto,

01:00:10.260 --> 01:00:12.700
or I learned Mandarin Chinese for six months

01:00:12.700 --> 01:00:14.620
because I needed to go to the gym

01:00:14.620 --> 01:00:16.740
and it sounded good to do that.

01:00:16.740 --> 01:00:18.060
And I-

01:00:18.060 --> 01:00:18.900
Is that true?

01:00:18.900 --> 01:00:20.820
I did, and I watched a Jet Lee movie

01:00:20.820 --> 01:00:23.500
and I picked out seven words and I was like, my God,

01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:24.340
I'm amazing.

01:00:24.340 --> 01:00:25.180
Seven words?

01:00:25.180 --> 01:00:26.500
I'm so amazing.

01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:28.620
But they were words like Coca-Cola,

01:00:30.020 --> 01:00:31.340
baseball,

01:00:31.340 --> 01:00:33.500
I'm so like-

01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:34.540
Night bowling.

01:00:35.980 --> 01:00:36.900
And punch.

01:00:39.780 --> 01:00:41.140
Yeah, well, I don't,

01:00:41.140 --> 01:00:42.300
this is a big topic to me.

01:00:42.300 --> 01:00:43.220
I want to figure this out,

01:00:43.220 --> 01:00:46.020
but I think that you and I both don't have the answer,

01:00:46.020 --> 01:00:46.860
but I think that you-

01:00:46.860 --> 01:00:47.980
I mean, isn't that just retirements?

01:00:47.980 --> 01:00:48.820
I don't know.

01:00:48.820 --> 01:00:52.580
I mean, I would feel like I was wasting my life

01:00:52.580 --> 01:00:53.820
if I was just, I mean,

01:00:53.820 --> 01:00:55.260
looking at a sunset is nice,

01:00:55.260 --> 01:00:56.740
but it doesn't need to be all the time,

01:00:56.740 --> 01:00:58.260
it should be a treat, right?

01:00:58.260 --> 01:01:00.500
And it does always just set.

01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:02.460
Like that's all it does.

01:01:02.460 --> 01:01:06.780
It's like, boo, like these supermoon people,

01:01:06.780 --> 01:01:08.300
like they're not going to be relaxed tonight.

01:01:08.300 --> 01:01:11.780
No, that's literally some werewolf is assaulting

01:01:11.780 --> 01:01:14.540
an old woman right now because of that moon.

01:01:14.540 --> 01:01:16.460
That's a big problem in LA

01:01:16.460 --> 01:01:19.620
that we're not talking about enough.

01:01:19.620 --> 01:01:20.900
Silver Lake Beards.

01:01:24.620 --> 01:01:25.460
Yeah, well-

01:01:25.460 --> 01:01:26.300
It'd be awesome if,

01:01:26.300 --> 01:01:27.220
I'm sorry, I'm a little high,

01:01:27.220 --> 01:01:29.580
but it'd be awesome if you made a,

01:01:29.580 --> 01:01:32.260
like a jet that went the exact speed

01:01:32.260 --> 01:01:33.780
that the earth rotates

01:01:33.780 --> 01:01:37.820
and you could literally just follow a fucking sunset

01:01:37.820 --> 01:01:41.540
around the world for until you ran out of gas.

01:01:44.740 --> 01:01:45.940
That would be possible.

01:01:45.940 --> 01:01:48.020
Wait, is that like a, is it like a,

01:01:48.020 --> 01:01:48.860
I missed the top.

01:01:48.860 --> 01:01:50.180
Is it like a chair?

01:01:50.180 --> 01:01:53.340
You make like a jet and you could just chase

01:01:53.340 --> 01:01:54.820
and it was like solar powered.

01:01:54.820 --> 01:01:57.780
So you just never had to fucking stop.

01:01:57.780 --> 01:02:01.020
And you're just, you're just Johnny Sunset.

01:02:01.020 --> 01:02:02.420
You're just always.

01:02:02.420 --> 01:02:03.580
Yeah.

01:02:03.580 --> 01:02:05.180
Isn't that Apollo?

01:02:05.180 --> 01:02:07.540
Like the Greek myth of Apollo is that he did that?

01:02:07.540 --> 01:02:08.380
I don't know.

01:02:08.380 --> 01:02:12.140
No, I think Apollo's myth is that he had a wagon

01:02:12.140 --> 01:02:13.780
with the sun as the wheel.

01:02:13.780 --> 01:02:14.620
Oh.

01:02:14.620 --> 01:02:15.460
I mean, I don't know if he-

01:02:15.460 --> 01:02:16.300
Aurora.

01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:17.420
There is, there is a God.

01:02:17.420 --> 01:02:21.020
They were a hot God who had sex with the animals did that.

01:02:21.020 --> 01:02:22.380
Sounds like Apollo.

01:02:22.380 --> 01:02:23.220
Promise.

01:02:24.060 --> 01:02:26.300
No, but the thing that I do for relaxation, by the way,

01:02:26.300 --> 01:02:28.660
that I feel centered is I watch house hunters

01:02:28.660 --> 01:02:31.060
and I see all these stupid bastards

01:02:31.060 --> 01:02:33.180
who get to quit their job and moved to Denmark

01:02:33.180 --> 01:02:34.820
because they've always wanted to.

01:02:34.820 --> 01:02:36.580
And I'm like, I want to do,

01:02:36.580 --> 01:02:37.500
one day I'm going to do that.

01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:39.020
And then I feel like I've centered myself.

01:02:39.020 --> 01:02:40.180
That sounds stressful.

01:02:41.860 --> 01:02:43.500
But I, but I think I know what you're talking about.

01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:44.740
When I watch intervention,

01:02:44.740 --> 01:02:45.580
I'm always like-

01:02:45.580 --> 01:02:46.420
Oh, there he goes.

01:02:46.420 --> 01:02:47.260
Ah.

01:02:47.260 --> 01:02:48.100
Ha ha ha.

01:02:48.100 --> 01:02:48.940
Ha ha ha ha.

01:02:48.940 --> 01:02:50.260
Ha ha ha ha.

01:02:50.260 --> 01:02:51.100
Is that that?

01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:52.140
Forensic files for me.

01:02:52.140 --> 01:02:56.540
I think I, I had never seen one until about two months ago.

01:02:56.540 --> 01:02:59.220
I was in Baltimore in a hotel and I started watching it.

01:02:59.220 --> 01:03:02.300
At least I could not fucking stop watching forensic.

01:03:02.300 --> 01:03:03.140
What is it?

01:03:03.140 --> 01:03:03.980
I've never seen it.

01:03:03.980 --> 01:03:05.380
It, it's.

01:03:05.380 --> 01:03:07.220
Ha ha ha ha.

01:03:07.220 --> 01:03:08.180
A fan right there.

01:03:08.180 --> 01:03:10.420
You know, really hard to solve cases

01:03:10.420 --> 01:03:12.860
and they break down how they eventually solve them.

01:03:12.860 --> 01:03:14.980
You know, they use luminol every time.

01:03:16.260 --> 01:03:17.660
And then, and then every once in a while,

01:03:17.660 --> 01:03:19.940
they can't use luminol because,

01:03:19.940 --> 01:03:23.300
the criminal had used a technique to make it luminol proof,

01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:25.300
which this show cannot disclose.

01:03:25.300 --> 01:03:26.140
Bleach.

01:03:27.140 --> 01:03:27.980
Ha ha ha ha.

01:03:31.980 --> 01:03:34.220
Like, I like, they're that worried about,

01:03:34.220 --> 01:03:36.500
about their show having that effect.

01:03:36.500 --> 01:03:37.540
But it's like, come on.

01:03:37.540 --> 01:03:38.860
What I'm learning from your show is

01:03:38.860 --> 01:03:40.580
if you're going to murder someone, own a boat.

01:03:40.580 --> 01:03:41.420
Like, like.

01:03:41.420 --> 01:03:42.260
Ha ha ha.

01:03:42.260 --> 01:03:44.100
Like, nobody, no crime.

01:03:45.380 --> 01:03:46.620
Ashonda Rhimes.

01:03:46.620 --> 01:03:47.940
Ha ha ha ha.

01:03:47.940 --> 01:03:51.260
What, wait, yeah.

01:03:51.260 --> 01:03:53.620
There's, wait, somebody else has a,

01:03:53.620 --> 01:03:56.980
Lee Ann, nobody, no crime, Lee Ann Rhimes.

01:03:56.980 --> 01:03:58.060
Now that's the same syllables.

01:03:58.060 --> 01:03:59.540
What's luminol?

01:03:59.540 --> 01:04:01.260
Luminol is a just blood detector.

01:04:01.260 --> 01:04:05.260
It's like, if I kill you, or if that guy kills you, let's.

01:04:06.260 --> 01:04:07.580
The guy in the Pokemon hat.

01:04:07.580 --> 01:04:09.660
You can mop up all the blood and it looks,

01:04:09.660 --> 01:04:10.900
you know, it looks like it's gone.

01:04:10.900 --> 01:04:13.500
But then they spray luminol and they shine a black light

01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:16.300
and it's just like, oh, there's all this blood.

01:04:16.300 --> 01:04:18.260
It detects the iron or something like that.

01:04:18.260 --> 01:04:19.100
Well, that's good to know.

01:04:19.100 --> 01:04:19.940
Is that new?

01:04:19.940 --> 01:04:21.620
They didn't have that with murder, she wrote.

01:04:21.620 --> 01:04:23.260
Well, she didn't need it.

01:04:23.260 --> 01:04:24.540
She had mental luminol.

01:04:24.540 --> 01:04:25.380
It's true.

01:04:26.380 --> 01:04:28.980
Did you ever see Angela Lansbury as the Queen of Sheba

01:04:28.980 --> 01:04:29.820
in like the 60s?

01:04:29.820 --> 01:04:30.660
She was hot as F.

01:04:30.660 --> 01:04:31.820
She was really hot.

01:04:31.820 --> 01:04:34.260
She was beautiful.

01:04:34.260 --> 01:04:35.580
She played the Queen of Sheba.

01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:38.500
Was it like Cleopatra or was it Queen of Sheba?

01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:39.340
I don't remember.

01:04:39.340 --> 01:04:41.300
But I've seen photos of her young

01:04:41.300 --> 01:04:43.300
and she was really good looking.

01:04:43.300 --> 01:04:44.140
Yeah.

01:04:44.140 --> 01:04:44.980
Yeah.

01:04:44.980 --> 01:04:45.820
Anyway.

01:04:45.820 --> 01:04:46.780
I thought you meant like her babies.

01:04:46.780 --> 01:04:47.660
Her young.

01:04:49.660 --> 01:04:50.500
Yeah.

01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:52.380
Yeah, what are you talking about, you guys?

01:04:52.380 --> 01:04:54.620
Oh shit, you didn't bring your book out here, did you?

01:04:54.620 --> 01:04:55.460
I did.

01:04:55.460 --> 01:04:56.420
I didn't bring it, but I got.

01:04:56.420 --> 01:04:58.340
Her book's in the, in the green room.

01:04:58.340 --> 01:05:01.140
Cause a big, not a big part of your story,

01:05:01.140 --> 01:05:03.060
but the recent part of your story.

01:05:03.060 --> 01:05:05.900
And we don't have to talk, it's gotten boring

01:05:05.900 --> 01:05:06.740
to talk about.

01:05:06.740 --> 01:05:08.060
Here it is, guys.

01:05:08.060 --> 01:05:09.340
That's my book.

01:05:09.340 --> 01:05:12.340
It's a New York Times bestseller.

01:05:12.340 --> 01:05:14.660
So they can't take that away from me ever.

01:05:14.660 --> 01:05:15.700
Which is pretty awesome.

01:05:15.700 --> 01:05:17.300
We could talk about Gamergate for an hour

01:05:17.300 --> 01:05:19.340
and just suck the energy out of the room.

01:05:19.340 --> 01:05:22.540
Which I, which I, which I don't think is a fair legacy to,

01:05:22.540 --> 01:05:23.980
it's 9-11 by the way, yeah.

01:05:27.740 --> 01:05:29.180
I don't want you to get the wrong impression,

01:05:29.180 --> 01:05:31.300
but we just, we get excited about it.

01:05:33.620 --> 01:05:35.620
But, but would you mind reading like,

01:05:35.620 --> 01:05:37.260
you have, you have passages in your book

01:05:37.260 --> 01:05:40.300
because I think it's funny and also empowering

01:05:40.300 --> 01:05:43.740
and kind of subversive of the intent of people

01:05:43.740 --> 01:05:46.580
who, who, who, who come after people

01:05:46.580 --> 01:05:51.100
under the banner of, of, of, of, of, of, of online, like.

01:05:51.100 --> 01:05:53.180
I mean, I could read the beginning of just that chapter,

01:05:53.180 --> 01:05:55.620
just about some horrible treats and.

01:05:55.620 --> 01:05:57.700
Yeah. Leading up to the, I thought, oh man,

01:05:57.700 --> 01:06:00.100
she should read this out loud cause it's sort of like,

01:06:00.100 --> 01:06:01.860
because I'm listening to you on the audio book

01:06:01.860 --> 01:06:05.020
and hearing you read the comments that people leave.

01:06:05.020 --> 01:06:07.540
The intention being for you to, like,

01:06:07.540 --> 01:06:09.700
I mean, the way that they speak,

01:06:09.700 --> 01:06:11.780
you would think that their intent was for you

01:06:11.780 --> 01:06:15.500
to just go and hang yourself or quit forever, judge.

01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:17.420
You know, it's like, and it's, it is weird.

01:06:17.420 --> 01:06:19.100
The internet is such a sewer.

01:06:19.100 --> 01:06:20.700
And then it's so like, like,

01:06:20.700 --> 01:06:24.380
for when people get so specific and so targeted,

01:06:24.380 --> 01:06:26.340
it's like, wait, are you, when I,

01:06:26.340 --> 01:06:28.940
when I heard you reading the stuff out loud,

01:06:28.940 --> 01:06:31.260
that I kept thinking like, oh,

01:06:31.260 --> 01:06:32.620
this must be their worst nightmare

01:06:32.620 --> 01:06:34.900
because these are their words.

01:06:34.900 --> 01:06:36.780
And they're supposed to like somehow.

01:06:36.780 --> 01:06:38.220
Well, they have a lot of imager pictures

01:06:38.220 --> 01:06:40.340
of how it's not completely their words,

01:06:40.340 --> 01:06:41.780
except it's just one tweet.

01:06:41.780 --> 01:06:45.100
And then of course that discredits my whole argument, but.

01:06:45.100 --> 01:06:47.060
But there must be what we know of these people.

01:06:47.060 --> 01:06:49.180
Like I think of it, didn't Orwell have some quote about,

01:06:49.180 --> 01:06:50.460
if you look at the way people,

01:06:50.460 --> 01:06:51.860
the weapons they use to attack people,

01:06:51.860 --> 01:06:53.580
then you know everything that scares them.

01:06:53.580 --> 01:06:57.220
Like it's just almost sort of an uplifting,

01:06:57.220 --> 01:06:59.300
like fairy tale irony to it.

01:06:59.300 --> 01:07:01.620
When you see people go after people that hard

01:07:01.620 --> 01:07:03.620
and viciously cause you know,

01:07:03.620 --> 01:07:05.060
even though it seems cartoonish,

01:07:05.060 --> 01:07:06.860
you know that that means that there's something

01:07:06.860 --> 01:07:09.380
you could say to them that would make them cry.

01:07:09.380 --> 01:07:11.580
Yeah, I mean, I've found, I mean,

01:07:11.580 --> 01:07:13.340
the funny thing is before that whole incident

01:07:13.340 --> 01:07:15.820
happened last year, I had finished my draft in my book

01:07:15.820 --> 01:07:18.700
and there was a chapter about negative comments,

01:07:18.700 --> 01:07:20.500
which if I, I'll just read just the first part

01:07:20.500 --> 01:07:23.300
and some of the nasty tweets that are out of context

01:07:23.300 --> 01:07:24.340
of that incident particularly,

01:07:24.340 --> 01:07:27.300
cause I'd rather just not give them more coverage.

01:07:27.300 --> 01:07:30.380
But, and so the chapter existed

01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:32.740
about trying to weather negativity online

01:07:32.740 --> 01:07:35.660
and how, especially because the roots of that particular

01:07:35.660 --> 01:07:39.100
incident, that was just a confluence of a bunch of,

01:07:39.100 --> 01:07:42.260
you know, basically it was a Chan attack

01:07:42.260 --> 01:07:44.940
mixed with some conservatism that gave it a label,

01:07:44.940 --> 01:07:46.420
mixed with men's right, addictivists.

01:07:46.420 --> 01:07:48.420
And it was like a swirling vortex of literally

01:07:48.420 --> 01:07:50.740
the worst of everything coming together to me.

01:07:50.740 --> 01:07:52.100
That's my perspective.

01:07:52.100 --> 01:07:56.460
And, and so, but the roots of it were sort of a backlash

01:07:56.460 --> 01:07:58.260
like we were talking about before of gamer girls.

01:07:58.260 --> 01:08:00.380
And I'm sure we've all seen those memes

01:08:00.380 --> 01:08:02.940
from like three or four years ago of like gamer girls said,

01:08:02.940 --> 01:08:05.220
and it's this girl with the little chunky glasses

01:08:05.220 --> 01:08:08.860
like mine, and it's basically mocking her

01:08:08.860 --> 01:08:10.620
and saying that essentially that this girl

01:08:10.620 --> 01:08:13.460
is adopting these things because somehow

01:08:13.460 --> 01:08:16.980
she's trying to get attention or be,

01:08:16.980 --> 01:08:19.460
make these gamer guys as sexually attracted to her,

01:08:19.460 --> 01:08:20.700
but she's really a fake.

01:08:20.700 --> 01:08:23.620
So that was really, I think the roots of sort of

01:08:23.620 --> 01:08:26.020
this festering thing that built up over the years

01:08:26.020 --> 01:08:28.140
that kind of exploded in that incident particular.

01:08:28.140 --> 01:08:31.140
But like I've experienced a lot of this in the chapter

01:08:31.140 --> 01:08:33.460
before this even happened.

01:08:33.460 --> 01:08:35.940
And it really, you know, several times

01:08:35.940 --> 01:08:37.500
I really did want to quit.

01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:39.900
You know, I did not want to make videos anymore

01:08:39.900 --> 01:08:42.140
and I believed them because underneath,

01:08:42.140 --> 01:08:44.060
if you're an artist, you're kind of insecure.

01:08:44.060 --> 01:08:47.420
So when you have that many people on mass get together

01:08:47.420 --> 01:08:50.380
and say, hey, you're horrible.

01:08:50.380 --> 01:08:53.180
And I'll read, you know, just a little bit at the top.

01:08:53.180 --> 01:08:54.300
Yeah, it's a good time to quit

01:08:54.300 --> 01:08:55.500
if you're not having a great day.

01:08:55.500 --> 01:08:58.060
Exactly, yeah, exactly.

01:08:58.060 --> 01:08:59.940
So I guess I could read just one page

01:08:59.940 --> 01:09:00.940
or something like that.

01:09:02.620 --> 01:09:04.860
Okay, I have a folder labeled hate folder.

01:09:04.860 --> 01:09:06.180
Yeah, this is the one.

01:09:06.180 --> 01:09:08.500
I interrupted you to say.

01:09:08.500 --> 01:09:11.820
I got it right.

01:09:11.820 --> 01:09:13.620
Guys, I've nailed it.

01:09:13.620 --> 01:09:15.420
I have a hate folder labeled hate folder

01:09:15.420 --> 01:09:17.020
that sits in the middle of my desktop.

01:09:17.020 --> 01:09:19.140
It's where I save screenshots of the worst things

01:09:19.140 --> 01:09:20.540
people have said to me online.

01:09:20.540 --> 01:09:22.300
50 shades of foolishness.

01:09:22.300 --> 01:09:24.020
For some reason, it takes the sting away

01:09:24.020 --> 01:09:25.540
to herd all the toxic comments

01:09:25.540 --> 01:09:27.340
into the corner of my hard drive,

01:09:27.340 --> 01:09:29.980
aggregating the losers I'd like to hunt down in real life

01:09:29.980 --> 01:09:32.540
and run over with a dump truck.

01:09:32.540 --> 01:09:34.420
Then back up again and run over them again.

01:09:34.420 --> 01:09:35.340
Too far, huh?

01:09:35.340 --> 01:09:38.340
Okay, if it's too disgusting to say to another human being,

01:09:38.340 --> 01:09:40.820
I guarantee that someone has said it to me online.

01:09:40.820 --> 01:09:42.780
The internet is amazing because it connects us

01:09:42.780 --> 01:09:44.980
with one another, but it's also horrific

01:09:44.980 --> 01:09:48.380
because it connects us with one another.

01:09:48.380 --> 01:09:50.740
Whether we want the connection or not.

01:09:50.740 --> 01:09:52.740
The only real life analogy I can think of

01:09:52.740 --> 01:09:56.060
is if a random person were to allow to walk into your home,

01:09:56.060 --> 01:09:58.060
punch you in the face while you're eating your oatmeal,

01:09:58.060 --> 01:10:00.420
then walk out again with no fear of consequences.

01:10:00.420 --> 01:10:02.500
After one incident, you'd be looking for a new zip code,

01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:03.580
wouldn't you?

01:10:03.580 --> 01:10:07.020
So here's some fun examples of the human awfulness

01:10:07.020 --> 01:10:08.260
I've collected over the years.

01:10:08.260 --> 01:10:10.780
Ethely Shaday, a woman using her sexuality

01:10:10.780 --> 01:10:12.580
to profit from male gamers and pretending

01:10:12.580 --> 01:10:14.180
she's empowering women and progressing,

01:10:14.180 --> 01:10:16.460
quote unquote, gaming culture.

01:10:16.460 --> 01:10:18.820
Her nose is so fucked up.

01:10:18.820 --> 01:10:21.420
Did someone hit it with a sledgehammer or what?

01:10:21.420 --> 01:10:22.900
Ethely Shaday, congratulations.

01:10:22.900 --> 01:10:24.460
You have a vagina and play video games.

01:10:24.460 --> 01:10:27.020
Now do something useful.

01:10:27.020 --> 01:10:28.660
That's my favorite formula, by the way.

01:10:28.660 --> 01:10:33.500
It's like, I don't have a vagina and people tell me I do

01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:35.620
and it's really no.

01:10:35.620 --> 01:10:38.340
No, but like the people, like if I talk about Minecraft

01:10:38.340 --> 01:10:40.220
too much, someone eventually will go,

01:10:40.220 --> 01:10:43.700
we get it, you're a celebrity and you do nerdy stuff,

01:10:43.700 --> 01:10:44.700
get over yourself.

01:10:44.700 --> 01:10:46.620
I'm like, what in the fucking fuck?

01:10:46.620 --> 01:10:48.340
Today, somebody called me.

01:10:48.340 --> 01:10:50.780
Yeah, they called me the Kim Kardashian of Nerddom

01:10:50.780 --> 01:10:55.220
and I'm like, I'm not nearly that successful.

01:10:55.220 --> 01:10:57.140
But it's that we get it thing, you

01:10:57.140 --> 01:10:59.140
shouldn't be allowed to, that doesn't make any sense.

01:10:59.140 --> 01:11:01.340
Like, hey Steve, we get it, you get a cap on

01:11:01.340 --> 01:11:04.020
and you're sitting behind a microphone.

01:11:04.020 --> 01:11:09.740
Like it just sounds like Ben there, done that.

01:11:09.740 --> 01:11:13.180
Oh, we get it, you're lowering your mic.

01:11:13.180 --> 01:11:14.660
Oh, we get it, the cap's back on.

01:11:14.660 --> 01:11:15.900
Win, I can't win.

01:11:15.900 --> 01:11:18.300
Oh, we get it, you can't win.

01:11:18.300 --> 01:11:19.340
It's not fair.

01:11:19.340 --> 01:11:21.620
It's like the Agent Orange of criticism.

01:11:21.620 --> 01:11:23.700
Well, it's almost like people who are probably

01:11:23.700 --> 01:11:25.980
shamed for what they love, trying to shame somebody else

01:11:25.980 --> 01:11:27.660
for those exact same things.

01:11:27.660 --> 01:11:31.460
It's a little bit unproductively and ironic,

01:11:31.460 --> 01:11:33.620
but in her fault, it really is her fault

01:11:33.620 --> 01:11:36.420
because I think at the end of the day,

01:11:36.420 --> 01:11:39.100
like I am who I am because I was rejected a lot

01:11:39.100 --> 01:11:41.220
and I never felt like I belonged anywhere.

01:11:41.220 --> 01:11:44.540
And now that I have been able to break out of that

01:11:44.540 --> 01:11:47.060
and show people that it's acceptable and be,

01:11:47.060 --> 01:11:49.460
I guess, more mainstream or more visible,

01:11:49.460 --> 01:11:52.260
then I have people telling me that, hey,

01:11:52.260 --> 01:11:53.940
you're just a sellout and you're pandering

01:11:53.940 --> 01:11:55.060
and you don't believe any of this

01:11:55.060 --> 01:11:59.180
or you're useless and your nose, let's see.

01:11:59.180 --> 01:12:00.860
If you honestly think Felicia Day worked hard

01:12:00.860 --> 01:12:03.220
to get where she is, eat a bowl of fucking nails.

01:12:03.220 --> 01:12:08.380
That's not even the worst ultimatum.

01:12:08.380 --> 01:12:10.900
It really is, eating nails.

01:12:10.900 --> 01:12:13.180
Eat a bowl, oh, fine.

01:12:13.180 --> 01:12:16.540
I mean, I'll get by.

01:12:16.540 --> 01:12:19.540
It's not like, yeah.

01:12:19.540 --> 01:12:21.260
Sorry, everybody.

01:12:21.260 --> 01:12:22.260
He's bad at insults.

01:12:22.260 --> 01:12:23.780
Spencer grew up on a farm and he has one

01:12:23.780 --> 01:12:26.020
of those cylindrical super magnets in his stomach.

01:12:26.020 --> 01:12:27.340
Oh, really?

01:12:27.340 --> 01:12:30.580
Because he grazes by the fence posts.

01:12:30.580 --> 01:12:32.740
He eats a lot of nails.

01:12:32.740 --> 01:12:35.060
It's just a fact of life in CME Valley.

01:12:35.060 --> 01:12:36.420
And I get through it.

01:12:36.420 --> 01:12:39.180
So he thinks everyone has a magnet in their stomach

01:12:39.180 --> 01:12:40.180
that lets them eat nails.

01:12:40.180 --> 01:12:41.740
Well, anybody could.

01:12:41.740 --> 01:12:43.980
That's what counts.

01:12:43.980 --> 01:12:44.820
That's all I'm saying.

01:12:44.820 --> 01:12:45.740
I have a lot of thoughts.

01:12:45.740 --> 01:12:47.260
Conspiracy websites?

01:12:47.260 --> 01:12:47.860
I really don't.

01:12:47.860 --> 01:12:50.580
I didn't even, earlier, a couple episodes ago,

01:12:50.580 --> 01:12:52.580
we asked if I had any conspiracy theories.

01:12:52.580 --> 01:12:53.540
And I was like, nope.

01:12:53.540 --> 01:12:56.060
But apparently, I have one.

01:12:56.060 --> 01:12:57.420
Michael Hastings.

01:12:57.420 --> 01:12:59.820
No, no, I think most conspiracies are kind of,

01:12:59.820 --> 01:13:03.620
you know, they, well, everyone knows about conspiracies.

01:13:03.620 --> 01:13:06.180
They work backward from the result they want to achieve.

01:13:06.180 --> 01:13:07.380
Yeah.

01:13:07.380 --> 01:13:08.460
Do you want me to read more of this?

01:13:08.460 --> 01:13:10.260
Yeah, I think there's a C word coming, right?

01:13:10.260 --> 01:13:10.740
Oh, yeah, yeah.

01:13:10.740 --> 01:13:11.660
You want me to read more of them?

01:13:11.660 --> 01:13:14.460
Are you going to give me to say this word on, OK, I got.

01:13:14.460 --> 01:13:17.980
Why do gamer girls always use the term nerdy geek and gamer?

01:13:17.980 --> 01:13:19.700
Can't Felicia Day just shut the fuck up?

01:13:19.700 --> 01:13:21.100
She's nothing but an attention whore

01:13:21.100 --> 01:13:24.060
that uses her gender as a key for attention.

01:13:24.060 --> 01:13:25.340
Tell me, would you have subscribed

01:13:25.340 --> 01:13:27.220
to this channel if Felicia Day wasn't a girl?

01:13:27.220 --> 01:13:30.700
If you say yes, you're a fucking idiot.

01:13:30.700 --> 01:13:32.980
Someone tell that red-headed cunt that the kitchen's

01:13:32.980 --> 01:13:34.660
down the hall and not front of the camera.

01:13:37.180 --> 01:13:38.540
All right.

01:13:38.540 --> 01:13:43.700
That's like a 16-year-old using, like,

01:13:43.700 --> 01:13:48.140
1960s cat skill comedy that he would, if his dad said that,

01:13:48.140 --> 01:13:50.780
he'd be like, dad.

01:13:50.780 --> 01:13:51.980
It'd be like Father Knows Best.

01:13:51.980 --> 01:13:55.900
You could see, like, Frank, what is that guy's name?

01:13:55.900 --> 01:13:56.540
Fred Murray?

01:13:56.540 --> 01:13:57.460
I hate him.

01:13:57.460 --> 01:13:58.260
He's dead, right?

01:13:58.260 --> 01:13:59.500
That's my three sons.

01:13:59.500 --> 01:14:00.620
Fred McMurray?

01:14:00.620 --> 01:14:01.620
Fred McMurray.

01:14:01.620 --> 01:14:05.260
Father Knows Best was Robert Young.

01:14:05.260 --> 01:14:06.460
Robert Young.

01:14:06.460 --> 01:14:07.180
OK.

01:14:07.180 --> 01:14:08.460
No, that's Freddie Krueger.

01:14:08.460 --> 01:14:11.500
Did you know that Fred McMurray never

01:14:11.500 --> 01:14:13.580
was in the same room with those children, though?

01:14:13.580 --> 01:14:15.180
Like, he would shoot all of his sons?

01:14:15.180 --> 01:14:17.780
Yes, he would shoot all of his scenes in advance,

01:14:17.780 --> 01:14:19.740
like, in a separate unit.

01:14:19.740 --> 01:14:22.020
And then it would be a double with most of the things.

01:14:22.020 --> 01:14:23.300
He'd come in and do a couple.

01:14:23.300 --> 01:14:26.260
No, I think that was William Frawley, who was also in the show.

01:14:26.260 --> 01:14:27.020
But he.

01:14:27.020 --> 01:14:28.100
Oh, it was William Frawley?

01:14:28.100 --> 01:14:29.020
Yeah.

01:14:29.020 --> 01:14:29.940
Why did he do it?

01:14:29.940 --> 01:14:31.220
Did he hate children?

01:14:31.220 --> 01:14:34.180
He just didn't want to do the show.

01:14:34.180 --> 01:14:36.020
He would, yeah, he would shoot all his stuff out

01:14:36.020 --> 01:14:37.940
in, like, you know, like a couple days,

01:14:37.940 --> 01:14:39.820
and they would just fake it.

01:14:39.820 --> 01:14:40.380
All right.

01:14:40.380 --> 01:14:43.140
Well, let's spread another rumor that's not true, Felicia.

01:14:43.140 --> 01:14:45.380
About 50s dead people.

01:14:45.380 --> 01:14:46.940
Can you just pick to do that?

01:14:46.940 --> 01:14:49.620
You're like, eh, fuck all these other actors.

01:14:49.620 --> 01:14:52.100
I'll just put me in a box and I'll do two days.

01:14:52.100 --> 01:14:53.700
Didn't that happen on The Good Wives, though?

01:14:53.700 --> 01:14:54.260
The Good Wives?

01:14:54.260 --> 01:14:56.020
She's CGI'd the last scene of Collindo?

01:14:56.020 --> 01:14:57.460
Oh, yeah, I heard about that.

01:14:57.460 --> 01:14:57.960
Yeah.

01:14:57.960 --> 01:15:00.140
Those monsters.

01:15:00.140 --> 01:15:03.340
Not the women, the CGI'ers.

01:15:03.340 --> 01:15:05.620
Anyway, CGI'ers?

01:15:05.620 --> 01:15:07.220
Do you want me to read more?

01:15:07.220 --> 01:15:09.060
I don't know if you have any favorites.

01:15:09.060 --> 01:15:11.580
No, I feel like I'm putting you through those meat grinders

01:15:11.580 --> 01:15:12.080
now.

01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:12.900
No, I totally read.

01:15:12.900 --> 01:15:15.060
I mean, essentially, the rest of it is, you know.

01:15:15.060 --> 01:15:16.780
Oh, no, I mean, yeah, I mean, it's, it's.

01:15:16.780 --> 01:15:18.380
They were the good, the good one is the tweets.

01:15:18.380 --> 01:15:20.780
Like, I, you know, I'll see something like that every day,

01:15:20.780 --> 01:15:22.980
but then I'll see hundreds of more positive comments.

01:15:22.980 --> 01:15:25.060
And you know, the cool thing is that I just went on book tour

01:15:25.060 --> 01:15:27.140
and I went to 13 cities and, you know,

01:15:27.140 --> 01:15:30.940
going out in the world is strange to me.

01:15:30.940 --> 01:15:34.260
But the coolest thing was there were so many guys who came up

01:15:34.260 --> 01:15:35.540
and bought the book and they were like,

01:15:35.540 --> 01:15:37.820
I'm buying this for my niece who's 13,

01:15:37.820 --> 01:15:39.820
or I'm buying this for my daughter who's 16.

01:15:39.820 --> 01:15:42.820
And I just love the idea that there were these fathers

01:15:42.820 --> 01:15:46.260
and, and guys who were, who didn't really know what to do

01:15:46.260 --> 01:15:49.060
for these girls who were at this age that you probably

01:15:49.060 --> 01:15:51.020
would abandon the cool things that you might love,

01:15:51.020 --> 01:15:53.180
like, you know, gaming or anything,

01:15:53.180 --> 01:15:57.460
anything that made them feel less popular or likable,

01:15:57.460 --> 01:15:59.820
that they wanted to give them any tool that they could find

01:15:59.820 --> 01:16:01.380
to be as who they are.

01:16:01.380 --> 01:16:03.100
And I think that was the coolest thing that I learned.

01:16:03.100 --> 01:16:05.900
Teresa thinks to the way they were in 1983 when it was like,

01:16:05.900 --> 01:16:09.100
look, we're too nerdy to be caring about something

01:16:09.100 --> 01:16:13.100
that our, like, our World War II, like, like,

01:16:13.100 --> 01:16:14.780
now I'm denigrating vets.

01:16:14.780 --> 01:16:18.220
We've got Tejano stars and vets.

01:16:18.220 --> 01:16:19.060
I've got Nick Harmon down,

01:16:19.060 --> 01:16:20.900
and a bunch of guys come up with like the caps

01:16:20.900 --> 01:16:22.860
and they're just like, why, and they're like,

01:16:22.860 --> 01:16:24.500
and they're like, why did you say that?

01:16:24.500 --> 01:16:25.340
You're terrible.

01:16:25.340 --> 01:16:27.020
We fought for your country.

01:16:27.020 --> 01:16:29.260
No, but I was, I'm just saying like that, that era,

01:16:29.260 --> 01:16:31.420
it's like, why are these like, like, we're dead,

01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:33.940
we can't possibly, our nerds that successful now

01:16:33.940 --> 01:16:37.140
that we're able to like split down into like camps.

01:16:37.140 --> 01:16:37.980
And I don't think so.

01:16:37.980 --> 01:16:39.780
I think these are people that are having a bad day

01:16:39.780 --> 01:16:40.860
or something and they're like,

01:16:40.860 --> 01:16:42.580
because it seems like from what they're saying,

01:16:42.580 --> 01:16:46.340
it's just almost like comedically over targeted.

01:16:46.340 --> 01:16:48.540
Like to me, one of the worst things I hear

01:16:48.540 --> 01:16:51.180
are when people are like, you know, it's the whole math thing.

01:16:51.180 --> 01:16:53.620
It's like, like, that's, it's like, well, who cares?

01:16:53.620 --> 01:16:55.380
Like, fuck you, I'm bored with you or what?

01:16:55.380 --> 01:16:57.500
You know, if you really, if you really,

01:16:57.500 --> 01:16:59.700
really, really do dislike somebody,

01:16:59.700 --> 01:17:02.380
well, I always say like the opposite of love isn't,

01:17:02.380 --> 01:17:03.380
hate, it's apathy.

01:17:03.380 --> 01:17:07.780
Like it's the silence that hurts people like us

01:17:07.780 --> 01:17:09.660
more than the attention.

01:17:09.660 --> 01:17:12.180
And it's the, I mean, when you, when you like come

01:17:12.180 --> 01:17:15.180
after somebody, I just think, I think that it's so,

01:17:15.180 --> 01:17:17.700
it's so, the thing that's really weird about it is

01:17:17.700 --> 01:17:20.820
because I have a 15 year old misogynistic little prick

01:17:20.820 --> 01:17:21.900
inside of me.

01:17:21.900 --> 01:17:23.020
I can access it.

01:17:23.020 --> 01:17:25.020
And I have one of the trunk of my car too.

01:17:25.020 --> 01:17:29.220
I have jars of them in my basement.

01:17:29.220 --> 01:17:34.220
But like, I can run that simulator.

01:17:35.220 --> 01:17:37.140
It's not that, it's not like the circuitry

01:17:37.140 --> 01:17:40.540
isn't able to go down there with a couple of switch flips.

01:17:40.540 --> 01:17:42.460
And, and when I run that simulation,

01:17:42.460 --> 01:17:46.060
I'm like, like the thing that outrages me is like,

01:17:46.060 --> 01:17:49.140
why is everybody trying to make something that's like mine

01:17:49.140 --> 01:17:51.500
and personal and fucking awesome.

01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:53.100
And it's all about being radical

01:17:53.100 --> 01:17:54.420
and honeycomb hat out.

01:17:56.420 --> 01:17:59.300
Like, like, like, what is all this bullshit talk

01:17:59.300 --> 01:18:02.180
about apologizing and backpedaling and sensitivity

01:18:02.180 --> 01:18:03.020
and all this shit.

01:18:03.020 --> 01:18:04.380
It's like, it's just like, like, like,

01:18:04.380 --> 01:18:07.300
and it's, the weird thing is no one,

01:18:07.300 --> 01:18:09.300
no one had to be doing that until,

01:18:09.300 --> 01:18:11.740
and it's just like this weird syndrome of,

01:18:11.740 --> 01:18:14.060
okay, the culture grew to the point where,

01:18:14.060 --> 01:18:17.940
okay, there's points of overlap where somebody says something

01:18:17.940 --> 01:18:19.300
and then somebody reacts in a weird way.

01:18:19.300 --> 01:18:22.900
And then it requires like the talk about sensitivity.

01:18:22.900 --> 01:18:24.100
It requires all that stuff.

01:18:24.100 --> 01:18:26.220
It's like, you ruined it, you know?

01:18:26.220 --> 01:18:29.220
Like, like, like the person who has that complaint.

01:18:29.220 --> 01:18:32.260
It's like, it's like, you, now it's necessary

01:18:32.260 --> 01:18:34.860
for somebody who wants their niece to grow up

01:18:34.860 --> 01:18:38.380
in a, you know, in an environment where she can flourish.

01:18:38.380 --> 01:18:41.500
They have the responsibility on them to do things

01:18:41.500 --> 01:18:44.740
like stand behind you publicly if you get doxxed

01:18:44.740 --> 01:18:47.100
or whatever and say like, this is fucked up

01:18:47.100 --> 01:18:48.100
and you guys are fucked up

01:18:48.100 --> 01:18:50.460
and fuck you Adam Baldwin and whatever.

01:18:50.460 --> 01:18:51.700
Like, like, let's do it.

01:18:51.700 --> 01:18:52.900
I got you, I got you.

01:18:52.900 --> 01:18:53.780
I got your back.

01:18:57.420 --> 01:19:00.620
Because if you don't, now you're like not.

01:19:00.620 --> 01:19:02.860
It just pisses me off because I'm always the kind of person

01:19:02.860 --> 01:19:05.620
who I like to be genderless in a sense that I am,

01:19:05.620 --> 01:19:08.100
I'm not putting, you know, a gender,

01:19:08.100 --> 01:19:09.980
like amending girl game.

01:19:09.980 --> 01:19:11.940
Like that's not something that I need to do

01:19:11.940 --> 01:19:16.220
because that essentially gives gamer the default to guys,

01:19:16.220 --> 01:19:17.060
right?

01:19:17.060 --> 01:19:17.980
So that's just the way I think.

01:19:17.980 --> 01:19:21.260
I don't, but what kind of enrages me is that

01:19:21.260 --> 01:19:22.980
there is an increasing need for women

01:19:22.980 --> 01:19:24.700
to have their own esports league

01:19:24.700 --> 01:19:27.180
or women to have their own thing in order to be,

01:19:27.180 --> 01:19:29.540
and they've shown studies that makes women more confident

01:19:29.540 --> 01:19:32.580
to participate in things that are not traditionally

01:19:32.580 --> 01:19:35.580
female-driven, which I'm like, no, just get up there.

01:19:35.580 --> 01:19:38.220
Be one of the guy, you know, be there and be equal

01:19:38.220 --> 01:19:40.820
and be represented as a person.

01:19:40.820 --> 01:19:42.500
But there is this need on the internet,

01:19:42.500 --> 01:19:44.380
especially when you're in little ecosystems

01:19:44.380 --> 01:19:46.180
to call people other, you know.

01:19:46.180 --> 01:19:47.780
Oh, you're other, your race is different,

01:19:47.780 --> 01:19:50.580
your sexuality is different, your gender is different,

01:19:50.580 --> 01:19:52.500
and you should be ashamed of the differences.

01:19:52.500 --> 01:19:55.260
That is essentially where the kind of power,

01:19:55.260 --> 01:19:58.580
I guess, is motivated because there are different kinds

01:19:58.580 --> 01:20:00.340
of people coming into these worlds

01:20:00.340 --> 01:20:01.180
with different opinions.

01:20:01.180 --> 01:20:02.020
And then you have people saying,

01:20:02.020 --> 01:20:02.900
we should be hypersensitive to the differences,

01:20:02.900 --> 01:20:04.540
and then you have other people going like,

01:20:04.540 --> 01:20:06.940
I'm hypersensitive to the idea of hypersensitivity.

01:20:06.940 --> 01:20:07.780
Well, yes.

01:20:07.780 --> 01:20:09.580
And then it's just like round and fucking round.

01:20:09.580 --> 01:20:11.220
We go because it's when the, it's when the,

01:20:11.220 --> 01:20:14.900
it's when the frustrated like, like semi-moderate people

01:20:14.900 --> 01:20:17.940
who had nothing but suppressable rage

01:20:17.940 --> 01:20:19.700
that could have, could have remained suppressed

01:20:19.700 --> 01:20:22.060
until they were 40, but they're, you know,

01:20:22.060 --> 01:20:23.580
it's coming out because they're like,

01:20:23.580 --> 01:20:25.180
they're being asked to pick a side

01:20:25.180 --> 01:20:27.220
and an issue that doesn't have to be an issue.

01:20:27.220 --> 01:20:30.580
Like the whole every, it's almost like everyone is agreeing

01:20:30.580 --> 01:20:32.260
that we don't want to live in a world

01:20:32.260 --> 01:20:34.500
where we have to have the fucking conversation 24 hours a day.

01:20:34.500 --> 01:20:36.820
Well, that was the whole thing I wrote a blog post about,

01:20:36.820 --> 01:20:39.300
you know, it was the kind of an essay

01:20:39.300 --> 01:20:41.380
about how at the height of Gamergate,

01:20:41.380 --> 01:20:44.260
like we need to stop doing this and we all love gaming

01:20:44.260 --> 01:20:46.300
and we need to show a positive face.

01:20:46.300 --> 01:20:47.580
And when I saw, you know,

01:20:47.580 --> 01:20:49.300
because of so much hatred that I was getting,

01:20:49.300 --> 01:20:51.740
I was like, you know, I saw some guys in some gamer shirts

01:20:51.740 --> 01:20:53.820
and I would assume that we would have been like, yeah,

01:20:53.820 --> 01:20:54.660
high five.

01:20:54.660 --> 01:20:55.500
And then I was just like,

01:20:55.500 --> 01:20:56.340
I don't want to deal with it.

01:20:56.340 --> 01:20:57.900
I don't want to treat, you know, just kind of,

01:20:57.900 --> 01:20:59.220
and it was almost unconscious.

01:20:59.220 --> 01:21:01.740
And I realized because people were really attacking me

01:21:01.740 --> 01:21:03.900
and shaming me and that these,

01:21:03.900 --> 01:21:06.500
those kind of comments were like 20 times, you know,

01:21:06.500 --> 01:21:08.180
at the height of that incident,

01:21:08.180 --> 01:21:11.460
I was subconsciously changing my behavior based on

01:21:11.460 --> 01:21:14.060
someone basically fucking up what I love,

01:21:14.060 --> 01:21:15.860
a culture that I love and something that I love.

01:21:15.860 --> 01:21:17.980
And I've always wanted to spread the love of

01:21:17.980 --> 01:21:19.580
and show people, hey, gaming,

01:21:19.580 --> 01:21:21.220
I mean, I spent the most time rewriting

01:21:21.220 --> 01:21:22.380
the real world of Warcraft thing

01:21:22.380 --> 01:21:24.380
because I really wanted to show people how awesome

01:21:24.380 --> 01:21:25.780
it was to play MMOs

01:21:25.780 --> 01:21:28.380
and how fun it could be and somebody aunt could read it

01:21:28.380 --> 01:21:29.860
and understand why their, you know,

01:21:29.860 --> 01:21:31.580
nephew would like these kinds of things.

01:21:31.580 --> 01:21:34.100
So during that, that's why I wrote that essay,

01:21:34.100 --> 01:21:36.900
which led to people posting my address online

01:21:36.900 --> 01:21:38.860
and a lot of people now just saying,

01:21:38.860 --> 01:21:40.100
I'm afraid of gamers,

01:21:40.100 --> 01:21:42.580
which is like literally the opposite of what I said,

01:21:42.580 --> 01:21:43.420
factually.

01:21:43.420 --> 01:21:44.740
Right, and your thesis wasn't even,

01:21:44.740 --> 01:21:46.020
this is another misunderstanding.

01:21:46.020 --> 01:21:48.660
When people talk about these subjective experiences,

01:21:48.660 --> 01:21:52.380
they're not saying this thing happened to me

01:21:52.380 --> 01:21:54.740
that is a crime that needs to be punished.

01:21:54.740 --> 01:21:56.460
They're saying this is the experience

01:21:56.460 --> 01:21:58.780
that is happening to me subjectively.

01:21:58.780 --> 01:22:02.020
And I, you know, I am a big fat,

01:22:02.020 --> 01:22:05.460
straight white bearded male at a middle age

01:22:05.460 --> 01:22:07.860
that has never had anything but good fortune,

01:22:07.860 --> 01:22:10.100
but being in the spotlight,

01:22:10.100 --> 01:22:12.180
it's nothing to complain about,

01:22:12.180 --> 01:22:14.100
even the negative parts of it,

01:22:14.100 --> 01:22:17.460
but it is, when, you know,

01:22:17.460 --> 01:22:21.060
when you've run afoul of the public

01:22:21.060 --> 01:22:24.220
and people are tweeting at you around the clock,

01:22:24.220 --> 01:22:25.420
you should kill yourself.

01:22:25.420 --> 01:22:26.420
No one likes you.

01:22:26.420 --> 01:22:28.300
Why the fuck are you in my newspaper?

01:22:28.300 --> 01:22:30.260
You dumb piece of shit.

01:22:30.260 --> 01:22:31.340
The guy was fletched.

01:22:31.340 --> 01:22:32.740
Why are you doing this?

01:22:34.020 --> 01:22:35.060
Like, like, like, like,

01:22:35.060 --> 01:22:37.540
and it's just like, it erodes at your psyche

01:22:37.540 --> 01:22:39.700
and there's nothing to, I deserved it,

01:22:39.700 --> 01:22:43.900
like, but it's important to note like how much,

01:22:43.900 --> 01:22:45.940
it freaks you the fuck out.

01:22:45.940 --> 01:22:49.100
So if you do happen to be like me,

01:22:49.100 --> 01:22:53.060
but have a vagina and have people that have wieners,

01:22:53.060 --> 01:22:55.420
like saying, like, like adding that edge to it

01:22:55.420 --> 01:22:57.020
where they're like, I know where you live,

01:22:57.020 --> 01:22:58.180
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

01:22:58.180 --> 01:23:00.940
I had somebody yesterday, like, at a convention

01:23:00.940 --> 01:23:03.220
and this guy came up and it was like,

01:23:03.220 --> 01:23:05.860
I love the furniture in your house.

01:23:05.860 --> 01:23:08.740
And like, and at the time, you know, you're signing,

01:23:08.740 --> 01:23:09.900
I'm signing hundreds of autographs.

01:23:09.900 --> 01:23:11.620
I'm like, oh, you know, that makes me uncomfortable.

01:23:11.620 --> 01:23:13.260
And I'm like, and I sign it and I go away.

01:23:13.260 --> 01:23:16.580
And then I looked at that guy, the handler with me,

01:23:16.580 --> 01:23:18.100
I was like, did you just really say that?

01:23:18.100 --> 01:23:21.420
And then I'm like, okay, A, he's trying to freak me out

01:23:21.420 --> 01:23:23.100
because he's trying to use the power, you know,

01:23:23.100 --> 01:23:26.420
just either he's a troll and he's like, look what I did guys.

01:23:26.420 --> 01:23:29.420
I went up and, you know, said this or, you know,

01:23:29.420 --> 01:23:31.900
there's a possibility like, could somebody have a camera?

01:23:31.900 --> 01:23:33.660
Like, it has to go through my mind

01:23:33.660 --> 01:23:35.580
because I've literally had people in my house.

01:23:35.580 --> 01:23:37.780
I have restraining orders against people who are,

01:23:37.780 --> 01:23:40.500
you know, have taken it so far and to imply that

01:23:40.500 --> 01:23:42.780
those kind of threats aren't as, you know,

01:23:42.780 --> 01:23:45.660
emotionally damaging and also potentially threatful,

01:23:45.660 --> 01:23:48.140
especially if you're in a public forum

01:23:48.140 --> 01:23:49.900
and even the internet can find where you live.

01:23:49.900 --> 01:23:51.580
Like, this is a real thing.

01:23:51.580 --> 01:23:52.780
There's been actual dudes in your house.

01:23:52.780 --> 01:23:54.620
Yeah, there has been a person, yes.

01:23:54.620 --> 01:23:55.980
That's not the thing that you're,

01:23:55.980 --> 01:23:57.460
when you write that blog entry,

01:23:57.460 --> 01:23:58.820
you're, that's not what you're taught.

01:23:58.820 --> 01:24:00.500
You don't, you don't lead with that.

01:24:00.500 --> 01:24:02.100
That's not the bad you're wearing.

01:24:02.100 --> 01:24:03.540
It's not about crimes committed

01:24:03.540 --> 01:24:04.980
and recompense needing to be done.

01:24:04.980 --> 01:24:07.420
You're saying that in that, in that blog entry,

01:24:07.420 --> 01:24:09.620
you're going, how did this fucking happen to our culture?

01:24:09.620 --> 01:24:11.660
Yeah, everybody needs to stop being hateful

01:24:11.660 --> 01:24:13.780
because you're making gamers look like assholes.

01:24:13.780 --> 01:24:15.900
Like that's what, the point of that was,

01:24:15.900 --> 01:24:18.260
and especially from a point of like,

01:24:18.260 --> 01:24:20.180
we all love this together.

01:24:20.180 --> 01:24:22.860
Let's figure it out and agree to disagree with respect

01:24:22.860 --> 01:24:25.140
because it just got to the point where it was crazy.

01:24:25.140 --> 01:24:27.780
And thank goodness a lot of people have spoken up,

01:24:27.780 --> 01:24:30.060
especially leaders in gaming

01:24:30.060 --> 01:24:32.540
and like gaming companies are taking it seriously.

01:24:32.540 --> 01:24:34.660
And it just like, to me, I love it.

01:24:34.660 --> 01:24:37.340
And I want people to know that gaming is amazing.

01:24:37.340 --> 01:24:40.300
And, you know, that really is a future of our entertainment

01:24:40.300 --> 01:24:41.140
is gaming.

01:24:41.140 --> 01:24:42.380
I just went to this thing called The Void

01:24:42.380 --> 01:24:44.780
and literally I put on some onoculus and a backpack

01:24:44.780 --> 01:24:46.660
and I ran through a maze

01:24:46.660 --> 01:24:48.660
and I thought I was in like a sky room.

01:24:48.660 --> 01:24:49.500
I'm not kidding.

01:24:49.500 --> 01:24:50.340
Look up The Void.

01:24:50.340 --> 01:24:52.180
It really, I did it in person.

01:24:52.180 --> 01:24:54.580
It might be the most amazing thing I've ever experienced.

01:24:54.580 --> 01:24:57.260
And I realized we are going to be living in all of worlds

01:24:57.260 --> 01:24:58.900
that intersect with nobody else's

01:24:58.900 --> 01:25:01.740
or we will be adventuring truly in the worlds

01:25:01.740 --> 01:25:04.460
that we want to escape to now, just in passive fiction.

01:25:04.460 --> 01:25:06.580
And in 20 years, it's going to be crazy.

01:25:06.580 --> 01:25:08.660
Have you put on the valve thing?

01:25:08.660 --> 01:25:10.460
The valve thing is nothing compared to this

01:25:10.460 --> 01:25:12.380
because I was actively running through.

01:25:13.660 --> 01:25:14.860
I'm not, I'm not kidding.

01:25:14.860 --> 01:25:18.820
Okay, well, I've died, the valve is the top

01:25:18.820 --> 01:25:20.060
that I've experienced so far.

01:25:20.060 --> 01:25:20.900
Just look up The Void.

01:25:20.900 --> 01:25:21.740
What's this thing called?

01:25:21.740 --> 01:25:22.580
It's called The Void.

01:25:22.580 --> 01:25:23.420
What are those treadmills?

01:25:23.420 --> 01:25:24.260
No, no, no.

01:25:24.260 --> 01:25:26.060
It's a literal, no, it's like,

01:25:26.060 --> 01:25:27.180
it's like a paintball arena.

01:25:27.180 --> 01:25:28.020
This guy knows.

01:25:28.020 --> 01:25:28.860
Just look up The Void.

01:25:28.860 --> 01:25:30.420
It's like, it got three million views on it.

01:25:30.420 --> 01:25:33.060
Wait, is it AR or VR or a TR?

01:25:33.060 --> 01:25:33.900
It's VR.

01:25:33.900 --> 01:25:35.340
It's like a holodeck.

01:25:35.340 --> 01:25:37.660
So you have an oculus on, which is not,

01:25:37.660 --> 01:25:39.380
it's not, it's like a customized oculus

01:25:39.380 --> 01:25:41.020
and a backpack, basically.

01:25:41.020 --> 01:25:42.860
And you put it on and you turn it on

01:25:42.860 --> 01:25:44.180
and you literally step through a portal

01:25:44.180 --> 01:25:46.660
and you're in an Indiana Jones ruins

01:25:46.660 --> 01:25:48.260
or you're on a spaceship and it feels,

01:25:48.260 --> 01:25:49.100
and you're shooting.

01:25:49.100 --> 01:25:51.100
It's not hard to stand up.

01:25:51.100 --> 01:25:51.940
No.

01:25:51.940 --> 01:25:53.700
I noticed the first time I tried oculus rift

01:25:53.700 --> 01:25:54.780
when it first came out,

01:25:54.780 --> 01:25:56.620
it would make me really nauseous a lot of time.

01:25:56.620 --> 01:25:57.460
Same with me.

01:25:57.460 --> 01:25:58.980
This one you're literally walking through

01:25:58.980 --> 01:26:01.060
and there's, so basically they're skinning.

01:26:01.060 --> 01:26:03.620
They're skinning the walls and they're skinning seats

01:26:03.620 --> 01:26:04.780
so that if you look at a seat,

01:26:04.780 --> 01:26:06.500
like it's a green block, right?

01:26:06.500 --> 01:26:08.340
In reality or like a gray block,

01:26:08.340 --> 01:26:11.180
but in my oculus, it looks like

01:26:11.180 --> 01:26:15.620
a archeological tomb and really you could feel it

01:26:15.620 --> 01:26:16.980
and it looks like you're feeling,

01:26:16.980 --> 01:26:17.820
I'm not kidding guys.

01:26:17.820 --> 01:26:19.340
I think there's a fire, they have a heater.

01:26:19.340 --> 01:26:21.180
Yeah, there's a fire, they also have a wind

01:26:21.180 --> 01:26:22.780
so you look out on a waterfall

01:26:22.780 --> 01:26:24.260
and you have wind in your face

01:26:24.260 --> 01:26:26.740
and you in the game think you are looking

01:26:26.740 --> 01:26:27.780
at a goddamn waterfall.

01:26:27.780 --> 01:26:30.180
And there's a salad bar and it's got.

01:26:30.180 --> 01:26:31.020
Yeah.

01:26:31.020 --> 01:26:34.100
It has a, and there's a, there's a,

01:26:34.100 --> 01:26:35.700
there's real salad in there, but then,

01:26:35.700 --> 01:26:39.180
but to you it looks like chilled monkey brains.

01:26:39.180 --> 01:26:43.100
Oh, I remember the snake surprise.

01:26:43.100 --> 01:26:47.460
I remember that guy in Temple of Doom.

01:26:47.460 --> 01:26:49.420
That guy loved to scary food.

01:26:50.380 --> 01:26:52.700
I was like, sir, have you ever had a Snickers bar?

01:26:52.700 --> 01:26:53.540
Like, I understand.

01:26:53.540 --> 01:26:55.300
You would have been great on fear factor.

01:26:55.300 --> 01:26:58.580
I understand the idea is that there's cultural definitions

01:26:58.580 --> 01:27:00.300
and there's some things that are scary to us.

01:27:00.300 --> 01:27:03.100
Maybe you find delicate, but, but, but,

01:27:03.100 --> 01:27:06.420
but these are baby snakes slithering around.

01:27:06.420 --> 01:27:08.140
And I understand even maybe you'd go,

01:27:08.140 --> 01:27:10.140
oh, I like to eat these, you know, I'm used to them.

01:27:10.140 --> 01:27:12.660
But he's like, snake surprise.

01:27:14.660 --> 01:27:18.140
He's so, he can't, he's like, chilled monkey brains.

01:27:21.660 --> 01:27:23.780
I'm like, I feel like you're protesting.

01:27:23.780 --> 01:27:27.500
Like, like, like, like, so, so if I bring the,

01:27:27.500 --> 01:27:30.460
the, the, the wedge iceberg, you know,

01:27:30.460 --> 01:27:31.500
the iceberg wedge over to you

01:27:31.500 --> 01:27:33.420
with just some nice ranch on it,

01:27:33.420 --> 01:27:38.420
would he go like, it's just no monkey brains.

01:27:40.100 --> 01:27:40.940
Maybe.

01:27:42.540 --> 01:27:44.740
Did you do the valve oculus with the kitchen though?

01:27:44.740 --> 01:27:45.580
Did you do that?

01:27:45.580 --> 01:27:46.420
Yeah.

01:27:46.420 --> 01:27:49.420
What did you automatically do when you opened the fridge?

01:27:49.420 --> 01:27:50.300
I broke all the eggs.

01:27:50.300 --> 01:27:51.460
I threw them into the wall.

01:27:51.460 --> 01:27:52.980
Well, I, okay.

01:27:52.980 --> 01:27:54.740
He dropped the carrot in the pot.

01:27:54.740 --> 01:27:56.980
You know, well, I also,

01:27:56.980 --> 01:27:57.820
That's all he did.

01:27:57.820 --> 01:28:00.260
I also, and, and everybody under 18,

01:28:00.260 --> 01:28:03.140
like plug your ears not for what you, what you think,

01:28:03.140 --> 01:28:06.180
but I just want to share something with my, my,

01:28:06.180 --> 01:28:08.780
my fellow, my generation buddy.

01:28:08.780 --> 01:28:10.380
I, I, within three minutes,

01:28:10.380 --> 01:28:13.420
I was, I, I, I was trying to slip my throat with the knife.

01:28:15.660 --> 01:28:16.500
Wow.

01:28:16.500 --> 01:28:18.460
I was, I was like, I was like,

01:28:18.460 --> 01:28:19.620
Did you see if you could do it?

01:28:19.620 --> 01:28:21.860
Yeah. I was just like, well, that's a real knife.

01:28:21.860 --> 01:28:24.580
Like, like, but it's not, it's literally my throat.

01:28:24.580 --> 01:28:26.300
Well, this isn't real. This is shit.

01:28:26.300 --> 01:28:27.620
Dangerous technology.

01:28:28.860 --> 01:28:30.780
But I mean, it was like, fucking, I'm making soup.

01:28:30.780 --> 01:28:31.620
No.

01:28:31.620 --> 01:28:33.340
Oh, I wish you were here.

01:28:33.340 --> 01:28:35.340
I was trying to explain that to Jeff Davis who was

01:28:35.340 --> 01:28:37.380
usually sits over there and he's like,

01:28:37.380 --> 01:28:38.220
when would I?

01:28:38.220 --> 01:28:39.640
Is it like the crude tons a real?

01:28:39.640 --> 01:28:43.080
Did they, did they use a reganod sauce?

01:28:43.080 --> 01:28:44.160
I'm like, Jeff, you'd have to say this,

01:28:44.160 --> 01:28:45.460
not it's not realistic soup.

01:28:45.460 --> 01:28:48.820
I'm saying you're can two people put on VR goggles

01:28:48.820 --> 01:28:50.420
and go into the same space.

01:28:50.420 --> 01:28:51.260
No, I was in there.

01:28:51.260 --> 01:28:52.580
I was in the void with another person

01:28:52.580 --> 01:28:55.240
and I saw the halo that she was kind of in a halo

01:28:55.240 --> 01:28:56.720
and she was shooting and I was shooting.

01:28:56.720 --> 01:28:58.100
I was like, there's a spider behind you.

01:28:58.100 --> 01:28:59.860
And I was shooting her and she was like,

01:28:59.860 --> 01:29:05.860
There was not friendly fire, basically, in that situation.

01:29:05.860 --> 01:29:06.860
No, but that's the next term.

01:29:06.860 --> 01:29:09.860
I mean, does that make you as a storyteller, like, want to tell something?

01:29:09.860 --> 01:29:12.860
Like, do something storytelling-y in that?

01:29:12.860 --> 01:29:13.860
What?

01:29:13.860 --> 01:29:14.860
Are you okay?

01:29:14.860 --> 01:29:15.860
I don't even know.

01:29:15.860 --> 01:29:18.860
Get ready for a surprise!

01:29:18.860 --> 01:29:19.860
Thanks.

01:29:19.860 --> 01:29:20.860
Thanks.

01:29:20.860 --> 01:29:21.860
Thanks, Bill.

01:29:21.860 --> 01:29:25.860
Thanks everyone born in 1973.

01:29:25.860 --> 01:29:26.860
Thank you.

01:29:26.860 --> 01:29:27.860
Total recall.

01:29:27.860 --> 01:29:30.860
The original.

01:29:30.860 --> 01:29:32.860
No, it really freaks me out.

01:29:32.860 --> 01:29:37.860
It excites me and kind of scares me because I'm like, oh my god, since the Lumiere brothers

01:29:37.860 --> 01:29:43.860
we have been, like, every all storytelling has been like through a two-dimensional pain.

01:29:43.860 --> 01:29:45.860
And it's like...

01:29:45.860 --> 01:29:46.860
Yeah!

01:29:46.860 --> 01:29:50.860
Teresa Lumiere, everybody.

01:29:50.860 --> 01:29:51.860
It's her birthday.

01:29:51.860 --> 01:29:56.860
She's 130 years young.

01:29:56.860 --> 01:30:01.860
She was the DP on horse walking out of a warehouse.

01:30:01.860 --> 01:30:08.860
Please put your hands together for her.

01:30:08.860 --> 01:30:10.860
The diva of...

01:30:10.860 --> 01:30:11.860
Oh, wait, no.

01:30:11.860 --> 01:30:12.860
The fem...

01:30:12.860 --> 01:30:13.860
The fem of...

01:30:13.860 --> 01:30:14.860
Fuck it.

01:30:14.860 --> 01:30:15.860
Is it too, like, an alliterate?

01:30:15.860 --> 01:30:17.860
The fem-photel of photography.

01:30:17.860 --> 01:30:20.860
Look if you look at me.

01:30:20.860 --> 01:30:21.860
The...

01:30:21.860 --> 01:30:22.860
Storytelling.

01:30:22.860 --> 01:30:28.860
Well, yeah, because it's like, oh, this is so exciting, but then I'm like, oh, if anything

01:30:28.860 --> 01:30:31.860
puts me out of business, it's like, I might not be able to make that leap.

01:30:31.860 --> 01:30:32.860
Might not.

01:30:32.860 --> 01:30:34.860
Listen how pretentious I am.

01:30:34.860 --> 01:30:38.860
Evil Knievel might not make that canyon.

01:30:38.860 --> 01:30:41.860
That might be the grandest canyon of all.

01:30:41.860 --> 01:30:45.860
I may have to hang up my American flag helmet.

01:30:45.860 --> 01:30:49.860
They thought Bigfoot would get me, but...

01:30:49.860 --> 01:30:52.860
That's a $6 million Mayhem reference.

01:30:52.860 --> 01:30:53.860
The...

01:30:53.860 --> 01:30:57.860
Yeah, it's weird because what's going to happen is we're going to understand...

01:30:57.860 --> 01:31:04.860
You're going to have to write stories even more so, like, beyond like David Mamet, you

01:31:04.860 --> 01:31:08.860
know, writing how people talk as an audience is watching a stage.

01:31:08.860 --> 01:31:09.860
You're going to have to just create...

01:31:09.860 --> 01:31:13.580
You're going to have to become an expert at creating awkward moments, I think, because

01:31:13.580 --> 01:31:14.580
you're going to want to...

01:31:14.580 --> 01:31:20.100
Like, new stories will be like, though, you know, I'm not saying we won't still enjoy watching

01:31:20.100 --> 01:31:24.060
people run from explosions and make dynamite out of chewing gum or whatever, but fighting

01:31:24.060 --> 01:31:30.500
werewolves, but the technology is going to be really, really, really good at, you know,

01:31:30.500 --> 01:31:35.580
you walking into a party and like, you're just noticing things and you're just a flop.

01:31:35.580 --> 01:31:36.580
You know, that's what we like to do.

01:31:36.580 --> 01:31:39.020
Well, this is kind of like, what is your therapist going to say?

01:31:39.020 --> 01:31:44.540
Because I personally think as a gamer, like, people will be more drawn to doing things

01:31:44.540 --> 01:31:45.540
and group.

01:31:45.540 --> 01:31:46.540
Like, literally going on vacation.

01:31:46.540 --> 01:31:47.700
We're also relaxing things.

01:31:47.700 --> 01:31:49.620
I think my therapist, because I really...

01:31:49.620 --> 01:31:52.540
You're bagging on her a lot and I want you guys to get along.

01:31:52.540 --> 01:31:53.540
I want...

01:31:53.540 --> 01:31:54.540
You'd like her if you met her.

01:31:54.540 --> 01:31:55.540
No.

01:31:55.540 --> 01:31:59.980
She could watch a virtual set with her lesbian wife.

01:31:59.980 --> 01:32:00.980
I think if...

01:32:00.980 --> 01:32:01.980
She's not...

01:32:01.980 --> 01:32:02.980
She's not like a ludite about it.

01:32:02.980 --> 01:32:03.980
She's like...

01:32:03.980 --> 01:32:04.980
If I was playing like, pop the...

01:32:04.980 --> 01:32:05.980
Pop the...

01:32:05.980 --> 01:32:06.980
Pop the cherries or whatever.

01:32:06.980 --> 01:32:07.980
Pop...

01:32:07.980 --> 01:32:08.980
Yeah.

01:32:08.980 --> 01:32:11.980
Like, like, like, like, like...

01:32:11.980 --> 01:32:13.980
Pop the cherry.

01:32:13.980 --> 01:32:14.980
Pop...

01:32:14.980 --> 01:32:15.980
Pop the bubbles on the...

01:32:15.980 --> 01:32:16.980
On the frog world.

01:32:16.980 --> 01:32:21.220
You know, like, like, something on my iPad that was like, if I told her, it relaxes me

01:32:21.220 --> 01:32:24.580
and I could be honest about that, she'd be like, great, why don't you go play that iPad

01:32:24.580 --> 01:32:25.580
and relax yourself.

01:32:25.580 --> 01:32:30.300
But, you know, she knows and I know that I'm like, I'm going like, I got so many monsters

01:32:30.300 --> 01:32:31.300
to kill.

01:32:31.300 --> 01:32:32.300
I got to...

01:32:32.300 --> 01:32:35.940
I got to get that special armor for that horse, so until I do that, I was like, ring,

01:32:35.940 --> 01:32:36.940
ring.

01:32:36.940 --> 01:32:37.940
That's UTA.

01:32:37.940 --> 01:32:38.940
Hello?

01:32:38.940 --> 01:32:39.940
Yeah.

01:32:39.940 --> 01:32:40.940
I'm going to write that screenplay.

01:32:40.940 --> 01:32:41.940
I'm going to write a real good scene.

01:32:41.940 --> 01:32:42.940
But first I got to talk to Chris McCann and I'm going to do it.

01:32:42.940 --> 01:32:45.180
I'm going to write the thing for Universal and I'm going to write the thing for Fox.

01:32:45.180 --> 01:32:48.860
And if I do that, keep my studio running, I'm going to get $3.9 million a year overhead

01:32:48.860 --> 01:32:52.380
and I'm going to say, okay, I got to get that special armor, I got to get that special armor.

01:32:52.380 --> 01:32:54.620
I'm going to be a success here and I'm going to be a success there.

01:32:54.620 --> 01:32:58.580
And it's not going to be any different, see, except this is faster and it's better than

01:32:58.580 --> 01:32:59.580
I thought.

01:32:59.580 --> 01:33:00.580
Okay.

01:33:00.580 --> 01:33:01.580
Oh, I just knotted off.

01:33:01.580 --> 01:33:02.580
I walked into a wall.

01:33:02.580 --> 01:33:03.580
Oh, shit.

01:33:03.580 --> 01:33:07.580
And I just like, play it until I'm asleep and then I go like, okay, I'll go to bed now.

01:33:07.580 --> 01:33:08.580
Maybe.

01:33:08.580 --> 01:33:09.580
And I go, I'm awake.

01:33:09.580 --> 01:33:10.580
I'm awake.

01:33:10.580 --> 01:33:11.580
Got to go to work.

01:33:11.580 --> 01:33:12.580
Got to go to work.

01:33:12.580 --> 01:33:13.580
I don't have time to do anything.

01:33:13.580 --> 01:33:14.580
Okay.

01:33:14.580 --> 01:33:15.580
All right.

01:33:15.580 --> 01:33:16.580
What's, why am I Joe Pesci?

01:33:16.580 --> 01:33:17.580
Why am I?

01:33:17.580 --> 01:33:18.580
Why?

01:33:18.580 --> 01:33:19.580
Why?

01:33:19.580 --> 01:33:27.180
Why am I this little tiny, like, methed out Jewish producer?

01:33:27.180 --> 01:33:29.460
I want to dame in every picture, see?

01:33:29.460 --> 01:33:34.580
But I, you're not allowed to smoke cigars anymore, so I'm vaping and it's not working.

01:33:34.580 --> 01:33:37.300
I do a lot of vaping in my car, see?

01:33:37.300 --> 01:33:38.660
I want a movie about vaping.

01:33:38.660 --> 01:33:40.060
I see a six-picture deal.

01:33:40.060 --> 01:33:41.060
I see Hasselhoff.

01:33:41.060 --> 01:33:42.060
I see Ringo Starr.

01:33:42.060 --> 01:33:43.060
I see Bethlehem.

01:33:43.060 --> 01:33:44.060
Why do I see Bethlehem?

01:33:44.060 --> 01:33:45.060
How fucked up, guys?

01:33:45.060 --> 01:33:46.060
Wow.

01:33:46.060 --> 01:33:49.060
Don't, don't applaud.

01:33:49.060 --> 01:33:53.540
That was a written character.

01:33:53.540 --> 01:33:57.980
Don't applaud it.

01:33:57.980 --> 01:34:00.060
I wrote that three weeks ago.

01:34:00.060 --> 01:34:02.460
I'm doing a one-man show.

01:34:02.460 --> 01:34:05.180
What's it called?

01:34:05.180 --> 01:34:07.420
Billy Crystal.

01:34:07.420 --> 01:34:18.100
Colin.

01:34:18.100 --> 01:34:20.220
The characters I am.

01:34:20.220 --> 01:34:21.220
Jesus.

01:34:21.220 --> 01:34:25.900
And it's like 90 characters, including the old blues man.

01:34:25.900 --> 01:34:34.700
When I was playing the blues, I used to play the blues so good.

01:34:34.700 --> 01:34:35.700
Thank you.

01:34:35.700 --> 01:34:36.700
Thank you.

01:34:36.700 --> 01:34:37.700
Thank you.

01:34:37.700 --> 01:34:38.700
Now, the old blues woman.

01:34:38.700 --> 01:34:48.420
When I was playing the blues, oh, wow, this is great, $60 a seat.

01:34:48.420 --> 01:34:49.500
This is more than comedy.

01:34:49.500 --> 01:34:55.740
This is kind of art, because he's drinking water in between his sentences.

01:34:55.740 --> 01:34:58.140
I got food in the mic, I got so excited.

01:34:58.140 --> 01:35:02.820
I still don't understand how, because I play video games and I get relaxed, but if I play

01:35:02.820 --> 01:35:08.220
like competitive games, I get horrible ass of reflux and I can't, I can't do it.

01:35:08.220 --> 01:35:11.580
Like I play here as a storm with my brother, I'm like, God damn it, get behind the creeps.

01:35:11.580 --> 01:35:13.060
You stupid girl, you stupid.

01:35:13.060 --> 01:35:14.580
Oh, dude, I don't play.

01:35:14.580 --> 01:35:15.580
I can't do it.

01:35:15.580 --> 01:35:16.580
I can't.

01:35:16.580 --> 01:35:22.060
Well, I had so, I had one experience where I was playing a Left 4 Dead one.

01:35:22.060 --> 01:35:23.860
That was scary.

01:35:23.860 --> 01:35:28.860
And I just accidentally stumbled into like this group of like, you know, I didn't ask

01:35:28.860 --> 01:35:33.220
because I was middle-aged and it would have been weird to ask this, even no matter what,

01:35:33.220 --> 01:35:38.740
but it was like, I got the sense that I stumbled into a group of younger guys that knew each

01:35:38.740 --> 01:35:43.220
other from high school and that were either gay or bi or something, because they just

01:35:43.220 --> 01:35:49.420
like, they seemed, they just, they weren't calling me faggot every five seconds is one

01:35:49.420 --> 01:35:56.620
thing that I was like, I think these guys are gay, because they're not fucking calling

01:35:56.620 --> 01:35:57.620
me a faggot.

01:35:57.620 --> 01:35:59.980
They call you the N word, they call you the N word.

01:35:59.980 --> 01:36:01.820
I'm like, I do not have that honor, sir.

01:36:01.820 --> 01:36:02.820
I shot you again.

01:36:02.820 --> 01:36:03.820
God damn it.

01:36:03.820 --> 01:36:07.540
And you're trying to argue with them like the guys are like, fuck you, I shot you again

01:36:07.540 --> 01:36:11.740
and they're like, here's the thing, like shut up, faggot.

01:36:11.740 --> 01:36:17.660
And I'm like, nice one, like, nice one, and I'm like, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you.

01:36:17.660 --> 01:36:25.660
Like you can't, I'm like, I fucking want an Emmy, I want an Emmy.

01:36:25.660 --> 01:36:39.900
Was it a, was it a faggot Emmy, no, best music and lyrics, so it was beat the Muppets.

01:36:39.900 --> 01:36:40.900
Look it up.

01:36:40.900 --> 01:36:41.900
It was the best.

01:36:41.900 --> 01:36:42.900
We get it.

01:36:42.900 --> 01:36:43.900
You want an Emmy.

01:36:43.900 --> 01:36:44.900
So good.

01:36:44.900 --> 01:36:58.300
Callback podcast, you know what, all right, let's, hey, will you, I don't know if you're

01:36:58.300 --> 01:37:02.340
into gaming or anything, will you stay out here and play, and play a shadow run with

01:37:02.340 --> 01:37:03.340
us for 10 minutes?

01:37:03.340 --> 01:37:04.340
Oh, the new one?

01:37:04.340 --> 01:37:05.340
It's a new one?

01:37:05.340 --> 01:37:14.460
Well, no, it's the expansion, the Tokyo or Hong Kong, we get it, you play shadow run.

01:37:14.460 --> 01:37:18.060
I'm actually in the game.

01:37:18.060 --> 01:37:22.980
We've been, well, you're talking about like the shadow run electronic, the actual, like

01:37:22.980 --> 01:37:23.980
the video game.

01:37:23.980 --> 01:37:26.980
Oh, we play, we play like, we're playing like, analogs.

01:37:26.980 --> 01:37:27.980
Oh, that's cool, sure.

01:37:27.980 --> 01:37:33.540
I actually, well, I produce a show where we do D&D live on Twitch called Critical Role,

01:37:33.540 --> 01:37:41.020
and it's because I played a campaign for three years just for fun, for my old improv group,

01:37:41.020 --> 01:37:47.700
you know, and I played a high charisma, very low intelligence sorceress, who would just

01:37:47.700 --> 01:37:55.060
be like, fireball, I don't care, I don't care you're standing there, I need a fireball,

01:37:55.060 --> 01:37:58.380
I got three mobs, you're dead.

01:37:58.380 --> 01:38:03.500
I think I've worked for you at NBC.

01:38:03.500 --> 01:38:08.140
That sounded like so many conference calls, and I'm like, is DeMorge here, DeMorge, you

01:38:08.140 --> 01:38:23.980
want to be back there, you want to, DeMorge Brown, hello, I know, is that, is that enough

01:38:23.980 --> 01:38:28.100
people, I can never figure this out, I think so, but you always say it that way, and then

01:38:28.100 --> 01:38:33.820
that makes it sound like there could, I don't know, what, there's enough people, see, that's,

01:38:33.820 --> 01:38:38.820
that's exactly what we need.

01:38:38.820 --> 01:38:44.660
All right, well, who said that, come on up, exuberant, exuberant man.

01:38:44.660 --> 01:38:45.660
Whoa, boldness.

01:38:45.660 --> 01:38:47.900
He's taking the hard way up.

01:38:47.900 --> 01:38:48.900
Yeah.

01:38:48.900 --> 01:38:51.940
My dog chewed on my glasses.

01:38:51.940 --> 01:38:54.420
What's your name, sir?

01:38:54.420 --> 01:38:55.420
My name is Dewey.

01:38:55.420 --> 01:38:56.420
Dewey.

01:38:56.420 --> 01:38:57.420
You look like a Dewey.

01:38:57.420 --> 01:39:01.020
Thank you, I was named after John Candy's character in Stripes, and I was the top of

01:39:01.020 --> 01:39:12.420
the figure, oh wow, wow, a kid named after a character in a movie I saw when I was 20.

01:39:12.420 --> 01:39:19.780
I'm going to just dig a hole, lay down, and hand you the shovel, because my back will

01:39:19.780 --> 01:39:26.980
hurt from digging the hole, I remember when Steve Martin was hosting the Oscars, I like,

01:39:26.980 --> 01:39:34.060
I like talking to the young creatives of today because it reminds me of my death.

01:39:34.060 --> 01:39:40.220
Well, welcome Dewey, thanks for coming up, well, I don't, it's not like you're doing

01:39:40.220 --> 01:39:43.580
it as a favor, you shout it out, I want to be up there.

01:39:43.580 --> 01:39:45.380
You're welcome Dewey, is what I should be saying.

01:39:45.380 --> 01:39:47.660
I have a little self-control.

01:39:47.660 --> 01:39:48.660
I've noticed.

01:39:48.660 --> 01:39:52.700
Have you actually played Shadowrun before, Dewey?

01:39:52.700 --> 01:39:53.700
Oh, not in my life.

01:39:53.700 --> 01:39:58.540
Well, you're unqualified, get out the stage, no, I have no experience.

01:39:58.540 --> 01:40:07.020
The kitchen's behind the camera, it'll be a wild card.

01:40:07.020 --> 01:40:12.500
Okay, so Felicia will give you the first choice, you could be, the character my wife usually

01:40:12.500 --> 01:40:18.900
plays who's like the face man, god damn it, I can never get his name straight.

01:40:18.900 --> 01:40:19.900
What?

01:40:19.900 --> 01:40:24.420
I can't remember Erin's character's name, it's Mercy O'Donnell, she's sort of like,

01:40:24.420 --> 01:40:28.340
she's like the smart talker, like she gets us the jobs and stuff and like kinds of people

01:40:28.340 --> 01:40:29.340
and stuff.

01:40:29.340 --> 01:40:30.340
Alright, that's not bad.

01:40:30.340 --> 01:40:35.820
Jeff Davis' character's Eve Libertine, she's like a sprightly fucking, I don't even know,

01:40:35.820 --> 01:40:36.820
wizard.

01:40:36.820 --> 01:40:37.820
She's a mage.

01:40:37.820 --> 01:40:39.820
Give this down to Demorige, because he's here.

01:40:39.820 --> 01:40:44.820
Nah, we don't have any Deckers, they're actually really complicated, so not like that, but,

01:40:44.820 --> 01:40:49.740
but, so none of these guys actually know how to play Shadowrun, so, and then there's like

01:40:49.740 --> 01:40:52.540
a mob doctor named Dr. Friend.

01:40:52.540 --> 01:40:59.100
I don't want to be the doctor, I'll be, Mercy O'Donnell, the face man, or the face lady,

01:40:59.100 --> 01:41:04.140
or, I'll be the face lady, that's not, I like having a high, a lot of skills where I talk

01:41:04.140 --> 01:41:05.620
my way through things.

01:41:05.620 --> 01:41:10.660
Okay, so, and then what do you want to be, the doctor, or, oh yeah, well just, we'll

01:41:10.660 --> 01:41:16.380
have, hand that down to Steve Agee, and then hand this down to Dewey, Dewey you're going

01:41:16.380 --> 01:41:18.380
to be Dr. Friend.

01:41:18.380 --> 01:41:28.620
All right, all right, um, you know how to play Shadowrun?

01:41:28.620 --> 01:41:30.260
The contractual timer.

01:41:30.260 --> 01:41:31.260
You're learning?

01:41:31.260 --> 01:41:32.260
Okay.

01:41:32.260 --> 01:41:36.220
Yeah, shit man.

01:41:36.220 --> 01:41:40.500
So uh, yeah, I mean it's um, we never know what's going on, I don't remember what we

01:41:40.500 --> 01:41:42.780
did last time, we're always this drunk when we start playing.

01:41:42.780 --> 01:41:47.180
There's like a drawing from Rick and Morty here, look at that, is this how, is this

01:41:47.180 --> 01:41:48.940
where it happens?

01:41:48.940 --> 01:41:56.860
Yeah, yeah, so we don't have any musical cue, I'd assume, right, that's fine.

01:41:56.860 --> 01:41:57.860
Don't worry.

01:41:57.860 --> 01:41:58.860
Oh shit.

01:41:58.860 --> 01:41:59.860
I just want to confirm verbally.

01:41:59.860 --> 01:42:01.380
All right, I'll give you a little something.

01:42:01.380 --> 01:42:05.420
I mean, wow, my phone just turned blue.

01:42:05.420 --> 01:42:09.060
Have you ever seen a blue screen on an iPhone?

01:42:09.060 --> 01:42:15.300
Yeah, well the new one came out, so, yeah, yeah, good point, so all of these are dying.

01:42:15.300 --> 01:42:20.340
Well it's a good thing that nothing happened last week, um, I was going to read Jason

01:42:20.340 --> 01:42:24.420
Clymer, he's the one who recapped the last time we needed a recap, I was going to read

01:42:24.420 --> 01:42:31.740
his recap because it said, the gang walked around in a storage facility arguing about

01:42:31.740 --> 01:42:38.980
what they should do, Eve Libertine sent out some crickets, nothing happened, end of recap.

01:42:38.980 --> 01:42:43.380
Yeah, it was something like that.

01:42:43.380 --> 01:42:49.620
All right, so we got, we got a lot of fresh faces, so I'll do like a real, like an actual

01:42:49.620 --> 01:42:56.180
verbal not prepared recap, so you had entered store quest, the storage facility, a multi-floored

01:42:56.180 --> 01:43:02.140
storage facility, you walked in the front door and started a costing, a costing the,

01:43:02.140 --> 01:43:10.180
I guess the cashier at the storage facility, and then you murdered him in cold blood.

01:43:10.180 --> 01:43:13.340
After that happened, you walked through the door that you could have always walked through

01:43:13.340 --> 01:43:19.780
the whole time without killing anybody, sending out some crickets, you tried to search for

01:43:19.780 --> 01:43:26.780
your quarry, your quarry was a big load, a big storage container full of MP3s, MP3s

01:43:26.780 --> 01:43:32.300
that were locked by specific, very high security musical locks.

01:43:32.300 --> 01:43:36.620
If you recall, you learned perfect pitch from a strange conservatory for the sole purpose

01:43:36.620 --> 01:43:40.860
of defeating these musical locks.

01:43:40.860 --> 01:43:45.060
What the fuck are you talking about?

01:43:45.060 --> 01:43:47.260
They're locks that unlock with music.

01:43:47.260 --> 01:43:48.260
Okay.

01:43:48.260 --> 01:43:50.140
Well, yeah, it's pretty straightforward.

01:43:50.140 --> 01:43:51.140
Okay.

01:43:51.140 --> 01:43:52.140
Okay, that's it.

01:43:52.140 --> 01:43:53.140
That's all that happened.

01:43:53.140 --> 01:43:54.140
You guys were arguing.

01:43:54.140 --> 01:43:55.140
You're standing there in the floor.

01:43:55.140 --> 01:43:57.300
There's a dead guy in the other room.

01:43:57.300 --> 01:43:58.300
There's cameras everywhere.

01:43:58.300 --> 01:44:00.980
You don't know, you know, yeah.

01:44:00.980 --> 01:44:04.860
You were just talking to Hat Guy, who's the, on the, on the phone.

01:44:04.860 --> 01:44:05.860
Yeah.

01:44:05.860 --> 01:44:07.260
Hat Guy or Hat Guy?

01:44:07.260 --> 01:44:08.260
Hat Guy.

01:44:08.260 --> 01:44:09.260
It's like Hawkeye, but hacking.

01:44:09.260 --> 01:44:10.260
Okay.

01:44:10.260 --> 01:44:11.260
Got you.

01:44:11.260 --> 01:44:12.260
It's a bad joke.

01:44:12.260 --> 01:44:13.260
Yeah.

01:44:13.260 --> 01:44:21.540
Hey, Hat Guy, are you, I think what the conversation we're having is, were you able to parse the,

01:44:21.540 --> 01:44:24.940
any information to give us more, you know, zero in on the.

01:44:24.940 --> 01:44:25.940
No.

01:44:25.940 --> 01:44:29.540
I mean, I told you that there's no of that, there's none of that information available.

01:44:29.540 --> 01:44:30.900
It's, there's nothing like that.

01:44:30.900 --> 01:44:33.660
I mean, you're looking for a vault that's locked with me.

01:44:33.660 --> 01:44:35.380
I don't know what you're saying, man.

01:44:35.380 --> 01:44:38.340
You're looking, you're looking through a vault, you're looking for a vault that's locked with

01:44:38.340 --> 01:44:40.460
musical locks, right?

01:44:40.460 --> 01:44:43.100
Musical locks, maybe different than other locks.

01:44:43.100 --> 01:44:44.300
Let me, let me look this shit up.

01:44:44.300 --> 01:44:48.860
I've literally never heard of a musical lock in all of my shadow running days, but I will

01:44:48.860 --> 01:44:50.860
look it up and get back to you.

01:44:50.860 --> 01:44:51.860
Okay.

01:44:51.860 --> 01:44:55.860
I'll just walk around and look at all the locks.

01:44:55.860 --> 01:44:56.860
All right.

01:44:56.860 --> 01:44:57.980
You do that.

01:44:57.980 --> 01:45:02.860
You see, you see a vault that's locked with large, large magenta locks.

01:45:02.860 --> 01:45:04.860
Hey guys, check it out.

01:45:04.860 --> 01:45:11.980
It's not like any lock I've ever seen.

01:45:11.980 --> 01:45:16.500
Looks like one of those musical locks.

01:45:16.500 --> 01:45:19.700
Is this going to open if I sing?

01:45:19.700 --> 01:45:22.660
Like is it that kind of musical lock?

01:45:22.660 --> 01:45:23.660
I don't know.

01:45:23.660 --> 01:45:27.980
Do you smell egg on the lock because I have a mother's egg allergy and it says here and

01:45:27.980 --> 01:45:30.140
I could not be near egg.

01:45:30.140 --> 01:45:31.140
No.

01:45:31.140 --> 01:45:32.140
There's no eggs.

01:45:32.140 --> 01:45:38.780
I might suggest that one of us possibly to start off singing a tone, a pure tone like

01:45:38.780 --> 01:45:42.140
we've just learned to see if the lock moves or adjusts in any way.

01:45:42.140 --> 01:45:45.140
I was in Chokwaya.

01:45:45.140 --> 01:45:46.140
So.

01:45:46.140 --> 01:45:47.140
Ice cream.

01:45:47.140 --> 01:45:48.140
Ice cream.

01:45:48.140 --> 01:45:49.140
Ice cream.

01:45:49.140 --> 01:45:50.140
Ice cream.

01:45:50.140 --> 01:46:02.140
Ice cream.

01:46:02.140 --> 01:46:06.140
Ice cream.

01:46:06.140 --> 01:46:11.140
Nothing happens.

01:46:11.140 --> 01:46:16.140
Nothing happens.

01:46:16.140 --> 01:46:22.140
Whether it works or not, it was a beautiful song.

01:46:22.140 --> 01:46:26.140
I'm going to look at this lock with my image medical verification monocle.

01:46:26.140 --> 01:46:28.140
I have a spy monocle.

01:46:28.140 --> 01:46:29.140
You do.

01:46:29.140 --> 01:46:32.140
It reveals several details about the lock's construction.

01:46:32.140 --> 01:46:33.140
Holy shit.

01:46:33.140 --> 01:46:37.140
One, the lock's casing is made just of regular ass plastic.

01:46:37.140 --> 01:46:44.140
And two, on the back of the lock is engraved a specific, there's a very specific set of

01:46:44.140 --> 01:46:46.940
words, almost like a sentence or a message.

01:46:46.940 --> 01:46:52.140
The words they say, Frankie Franks, album one track two.

01:46:52.140 --> 01:46:53.140
Oh.

01:46:53.140 --> 01:46:54.140
Frankie Franks.

01:46:54.140 --> 01:46:56.140
Frankie Franks, album one track two.

01:46:56.140 --> 01:46:59.140
We got to find that album and that track.

01:46:59.140 --> 01:47:00.140
We already have it.

01:47:00.140 --> 01:47:02.140
Yeah, the cricket brought it back.

01:47:02.140 --> 01:47:03.140
The cricket brought it back.

01:47:03.140 --> 01:47:04.140
The cricket brought it back.

01:47:04.140 --> 01:47:06.140
Wait, the cricket brought back an mp3?

01:47:06.140 --> 01:47:07.140
Yeah.

01:47:07.140 --> 01:47:10.140
Let's play that shit.

01:47:10.140 --> 01:47:16.140
All right, I'll put it, put somebody put it in there, player.

01:47:16.140 --> 01:47:22.140
I do not have an mp3 on me, but I have a moderate egg allergy.

01:47:22.140 --> 01:47:23.140
So please.

01:47:23.140 --> 01:47:29.140
I have a skill soft that I could apply it to.

01:47:29.140 --> 01:47:31.140
So if we apply it to that, I could actually play it possibly.

01:47:31.140 --> 01:47:32.140
Yeah, man.

01:47:32.140 --> 01:47:34.140
You can jack it into your brain hole.

01:47:34.140 --> 01:47:40.140
Great.

01:47:40.140 --> 01:47:46.140
It was Saturday night and you were standing by the window.

01:47:46.140 --> 01:47:47.140
It's very beautiful.

01:47:47.140 --> 01:47:50.140
I said, I love that look on you.

01:47:50.140 --> 01:47:59.140
The lock snaps open.

01:47:59.140 --> 01:48:05.140
I can't believe we took all those fucking lessons together.

01:48:05.140 --> 01:48:07.140
Those fucking children.

01:48:07.140 --> 01:48:14.140
As the roller door rolls open automatically, you see stacks of note boxes upon boxes full

01:48:14.140 --> 01:48:17.140
of mp3 data chips.

01:48:17.140 --> 01:48:20.140
It's a real mother load.

01:48:20.140 --> 01:48:24.140
These are very valuable, I believe.

01:48:24.140 --> 01:48:28.140
It's the best Christmas dinner I ever had.

01:48:28.140 --> 01:48:37.140
That's a clip from the diehard trilogy video game on the first PlayStation.

01:48:37.140 --> 01:48:39.140
Was that the arcade game where you were like fighting?

01:48:39.140 --> 01:48:42.140
Yeah, well, there was three diehard games.

01:48:42.140 --> 01:48:44.140
One was like crazy taxi.

01:48:44.140 --> 01:48:49.140
One of them, you're just running around like a top down third person thing.

01:48:49.140 --> 01:48:50.140
I loved that one.

01:48:50.140 --> 01:48:54.140
And when you found, when you'd find health ups, sometimes you'd say random things,

01:48:54.140 --> 01:49:00.140
one of them being, it's the best Christmas dinner I ever had.

01:49:00.140 --> 01:49:03.140
And then when you got hit, sometimes you'd go, all things being considered,

01:49:03.140 --> 01:49:10.140
I'd rather be a Philadelphia.

01:49:10.140 --> 01:49:14.140
Mp3 chips, more than you can carry on your own.

01:49:14.140 --> 01:49:15.140
We can carry all of these.

01:49:15.140 --> 01:49:17.140
More than that.

01:49:17.140 --> 01:49:22.140
I still believe we can carry all of these.

01:49:22.140 --> 01:49:24.140
Okay, sorry, I missed that part.

01:49:24.140 --> 01:49:26.140
We can't carry all of these?

01:49:26.140 --> 01:49:27.140
I believe we can carry all of these.

01:49:27.140 --> 01:49:31.140
I start eating these Mp3 chips so that they sit in my stomach.

01:49:31.140 --> 01:49:36.140
Quickly, Dr. Frank, please ascertain if they're made of egg in any way.

01:49:36.140 --> 01:49:37.140
They're not.

01:49:37.140 --> 01:49:38.140
Do some sort of scan.

01:49:38.140 --> 01:49:40.140
Oh no, you could just tell by looking at them.

01:49:40.140 --> 01:49:42.140
These are the egg-free ones.

01:49:42.140 --> 01:49:43.140
Oh good.

01:49:43.140 --> 01:49:48.140
Is it possible to load the data from them without using the physical casing?

01:49:48.140 --> 01:49:51.140
Oh yeah, you could definitely rip all of them, but it takes some time.

01:49:51.140 --> 01:49:52.140
I'll be right back.

01:49:52.140 --> 01:49:53.140
I've got an idea.

01:49:53.140 --> 01:49:55.140
I'm going to go to the outside.

01:49:55.140 --> 01:49:57.140
Oh, we came here in an Uber, right?

01:49:57.140 --> 01:49:58.140
Yep.

01:49:58.140 --> 01:50:00.140
Shit, I come back.

01:50:00.140 --> 01:50:06.140
I had an idea, but I kept picturing us as having a car.

01:50:06.140 --> 01:50:08.140
Maybe you should get one.

01:50:08.140 --> 01:50:13.140
Well, you know, but we drink a lot, and I think that all things considered,

01:50:13.140 --> 01:50:15.140
I think we're saving a lot.

01:50:15.140 --> 01:50:17.140
That's not how driving works in the future.

01:50:17.140 --> 01:50:20.140
They let you do it drunk?

01:50:20.140 --> 01:50:21.140
Yeah.

01:50:21.140 --> 01:50:23.140
The computer doesn't for you, man.

01:50:23.140 --> 01:50:25.140
Guys, we got to get a car.

01:50:25.140 --> 01:50:30.140
Maybe we can take all of these MP3 pairs and sell one and buy a car.

01:50:30.140 --> 01:50:34.140
I'm scared someone will hack our onboard computer in the car and kill us.

01:50:34.140 --> 01:50:35.140
All right, okay.

01:50:35.140 --> 01:50:36.140
All right, hold on.

01:50:36.140 --> 01:50:37.140
I know a guy that died.

01:50:37.140 --> 01:50:39.140
I'll be right back.

01:50:39.140 --> 01:50:40.140
I'll be right back.

01:50:40.140 --> 01:50:41.140
I got a second idea.

01:50:41.140 --> 01:50:42.140
I run out.

01:50:42.140 --> 01:50:44.140
I'm looking for a car, just a stranger's car.

01:50:44.140 --> 01:50:45.140
All right.

01:50:45.140 --> 01:50:47.140
Because, you know...

01:50:47.140 --> 01:50:48.140
Oh, so it's a storage...

01:50:48.140 --> 01:50:49.140
Yeah, they even find a car.

01:50:49.140 --> 01:50:50.140
It is a storage facility.

01:50:50.140 --> 01:50:53.140
I would think that there was a lift or a cart of some kind.

01:50:53.140 --> 01:50:55.140
There's like a loading dock.

01:50:55.140 --> 01:50:56.140
I mean, there's carts.

01:50:56.140 --> 01:51:00.140
You don't know where they are, though, because you killed the guy.

01:51:00.140 --> 01:51:06.140
I'm going to use my knowledge as a former law enforcement officer,

01:51:06.140 --> 01:51:10.140
including my undercover training as a criminal.

01:51:10.140 --> 01:51:11.140
My back story is very complicated,

01:51:11.140 --> 01:51:15.140
and along the way, I certainly learned how to hotwire a car.

01:51:15.140 --> 01:51:17.140
I have a cellular glove maker.

01:51:17.140 --> 01:51:22.140
So I would make a glove that can lift everything and float it away.

01:51:22.140 --> 01:51:25.140
You couldn't make a glove that strong.

01:51:25.140 --> 01:51:28.140
The glove maker is for fingerprints and stuff.

01:51:28.140 --> 01:51:30.140
It's for spoofing fingerprints.

01:51:30.140 --> 01:51:33.140
Okay, so this is not going to work.

01:51:33.140 --> 01:51:37.140
How about you load the chips into me?

01:51:37.140 --> 01:51:41.140
That's a great idea.

01:51:41.140 --> 01:51:42.140
That's your solution to everything.

01:51:42.140 --> 01:51:48.140
Then I'll be your jukebox, your carrying facility, your transporter.

01:51:48.140 --> 01:51:51.140
But someone would have to pull out weapons and guard the door,

01:51:51.140 --> 01:51:53.140
and someone would have to feed at the same time.

01:51:53.140 --> 01:51:55.140
I've noticed that I can increase my body.

01:51:55.140 --> 01:51:57.140
Could I possibly get larger and carry more?

01:51:57.140 --> 01:51:58.140
Yeah, definitely.

01:51:58.140 --> 01:52:00.140
It'll help you somewhat.

01:52:00.140 --> 01:52:01.140
You do that.

01:52:01.140 --> 01:52:06.140
You get too larger.

01:52:06.140 --> 01:52:08.140
I pick up twice as many chips as before.

01:52:08.140 --> 01:52:11.140
Well, that's not how the math works out.

01:52:11.140 --> 01:52:18.140
You pick up 45% more chips.

01:52:18.140 --> 01:52:23.140
You're still not nearly to catgathering them all, though.

01:52:23.140 --> 01:52:25.140
It's going to take some time.

01:52:25.140 --> 01:52:27.140
The car, it gets hot wired.

01:52:27.140 --> 01:52:32.140
Best Christmas dinner I ever had.

01:52:32.140 --> 01:52:38.140
Where are you going?

01:52:38.140 --> 01:52:45.140
I was getting a handle.

01:52:45.140 --> 01:52:48.140
Where am I?

01:52:48.140 --> 01:52:50.140
You're outside the place.

01:52:50.140 --> 01:52:56.140
I'm going to drive through the doors and up to the storage unit.

01:52:56.140 --> 01:52:58.140
I'm going to flip a bitch.

01:52:58.140 --> 01:53:00.140
Is that still a phrase?

01:53:00.140 --> 01:53:01.140
Yeah.

01:53:01.140 --> 01:53:04.140
And then I'm going to back in through the doors.

01:53:04.140 --> 01:53:07.140
So it's like, from their point of view, I said I'll be right back.

01:53:07.140 --> 01:53:09.140
After that first fuck-up, which was a little embarrassing.

01:53:09.140 --> 01:53:11.140
Over time, they'll forget it, though.

01:53:11.140 --> 01:53:13.140
Because the second time, I said, now I got a different idea.

01:53:13.140 --> 01:53:16.140
And I left, and then...

01:53:16.140 --> 01:53:17.140
And I came through.

01:53:17.140 --> 01:53:18.140
It's kind of cool.

01:53:18.140 --> 01:53:20.140
Yeah, your car smashes through the loading dock.

01:53:20.140 --> 01:53:21.140
It arrives.

01:53:21.140 --> 01:53:25.140
It pulls to a stop right outside the thing.

01:53:25.140 --> 01:53:29.140
You guys call it a car guy?

01:53:29.140 --> 01:53:30.140
No, we didn't.

01:53:30.140 --> 01:53:31.140
But awesome.

01:53:31.140 --> 01:53:33.140
He did when he's suave.

01:53:33.140 --> 01:53:34.140
He's not French.

01:53:34.140 --> 01:53:35.140
He's going to be suave.

01:53:35.140 --> 01:53:37.140
I have a...

01:53:37.140 --> 01:53:38.140
Open the trunk.

01:53:38.140 --> 01:53:40.140
Let's start shoveling this shit out.

01:53:40.140 --> 01:53:45.140
And I would like to use my adrenaline boost to help both in strength and in velocity,

01:53:45.140 --> 01:53:49.140
as I move these faster and faster and faster.

01:53:49.140 --> 01:53:53.140
Both your strength and your velocity are improved by your adrenaline boost

01:53:53.140 --> 01:53:59.140
as you load mp3 chips into the trunk of a car.

01:53:59.140 --> 01:54:02.140
Soon, all the chips are loaded in the car.

01:54:02.140 --> 01:54:03.140
Excellent.

01:54:03.140 --> 01:54:07.140
It was great.

01:54:07.140 --> 01:54:11.140
Imagine being the guy that grew two sizes.

01:54:11.140 --> 01:54:15.140
Yeah, there's no decreased body on my list.

01:54:15.140 --> 01:54:19.140
Do I need to walk home or...?

01:54:19.140 --> 01:54:21.140
Hop on the roof, dude.

01:54:21.140 --> 01:54:23.140
You can disperse it if you want.

01:54:23.140 --> 01:54:24.140
I want?

01:54:24.140 --> 01:54:25.140
If you want.

01:54:25.140 --> 01:54:26.140
Yeah, I do.

01:54:26.140 --> 01:54:27.140
Very much.

01:54:27.140 --> 01:54:29.140
That happens.

01:54:29.140 --> 01:54:35.140
Turning to normal size, you realize you could fit in this car.

01:54:35.140 --> 01:54:38.140
You hear Hakai buzzing in on your earpieces.

01:54:38.140 --> 01:54:44.140
He's like, hey man, I was looking up musical locks and I was slipping.

01:54:44.140 --> 01:54:51.140
I didn't kill the live video feed that gets sent to the police station.

01:54:51.140 --> 01:54:57.140
So, you got about 30 seconds before this place is surrounded.

01:54:57.140 --> 01:55:00.140
Get in the car, get in the car.

01:55:00.140 --> 01:55:01.140
They're playing.

01:55:01.140 --> 01:55:06.140
But wait, so the cops are going to know what we look like forever?

01:55:06.140 --> 01:55:09.140
Oh, I mean, they already know what you look like.

01:55:09.140 --> 01:55:11.140
We're shadow runners.

01:55:11.140 --> 01:55:12.140
Okay.

01:55:12.140 --> 01:55:13.140
Everybody in.

01:55:13.140 --> 01:55:14.140
Let's get the fuck out of here.

01:55:14.140 --> 01:55:15.140
Let's get the fuck out of here.

01:55:15.140 --> 01:55:17.140
I feel like someone did not do their job properly.

01:55:17.140 --> 01:55:19.140
Yeah, I fucked up.

01:55:19.140 --> 01:55:21.140
All right, let's talk about it later.

01:55:21.140 --> 01:55:27.140
In his defense, we always forget to bring him, because he's a non-player character.

01:55:27.140 --> 01:55:28.140
Everybody in?

01:55:28.140 --> 01:55:29.140
Yep.

01:55:29.140 --> 01:55:30.140
All right.

01:55:30.140 --> 01:55:31.140
Wee.

01:55:31.140 --> 01:55:36.140
All things considered, rather than being Philadelphia.

01:55:36.140 --> 01:55:39.140
Cliff Hagger.

01:55:39.140 --> 01:55:47.140
Felicia Day, everybody.

01:55:47.140 --> 01:55:51.140
You know her, you've docked her.

01:55:51.140 --> 01:55:52.140
Get her booked.

01:55:52.140 --> 01:55:54.140
You're never weird on the internet.

01:55:54.140 --> 01:55:55.140
Almost.

01:55:55.140 --> 01:55:56.140
Almost.

01:55:56.140 --> 01:55:57.140
Yeah.

01:55:57.140 --> 01:55:58.140
Check it out.

01:55:58.140 --> 01:56:02.140
It's four and a half hours at 1.25 speed.

01:56:02.140 --> 01:56:08.140
DeMorge Brown, Dewey, Dewey Newcomb, Steve Agee.

01:56:08.140 --> 01:56:10.140
Dan Harmon.

01:56:10.140 --> 01:56:14.140
Justin Marshall, our feral audio producer.

01:56:14.140 --> 01:56:19.140
Zach, the audio maniac, Kris Boruff on the camera manning.

01:56:19.140 --> 01:56:26.140
Kevin Day, Felicia's cousin, who's met him, I think, five times in his life, who is responsible

01:56:26.140 --> 01:56:28.140
for making this streaming stuff happen.

01:56:28.140 --> 01:56:32.140
Thank you, Kevin, and who probably was our connection to Felicia.

01:56:32.140 --> 01:56:33.140
Yeah, thank you guys so much.

01:56:33.140 --> 01:56:42.140
We'll see you next week.

01:56:42.140 --> 01:56:49.140
Get any of that.

01:56:49.140 --> 01:57:14.140
Feral audio.
