01:55.160 --> 02:00.400
It's a it's a it's a mellow evening. We knew we were in trouble when Steve Levy did his

02:00.400 --> 02:07.920
A little his little walkabout out here kind of looked at his watch. It's kind of like I was watching him on the monitor

02:07.920 --> 02:09.920
I'm like that's a guy that wants a little bit of applause

02:10.440 --> 02:14.600
Yeah, and yet and you guys are like fuck you start the show

02:15.600 --> 02:19.320
But yet the vodka is still not out here. That's cuz he didn't get that little pop

02:19.320 --> 02:21.320
Yeah, you think he's gonna like give it up now

02:22.720 --> 02:27.800
Yeah, so what if I went back there and got the vodka out for you when I get stabbed by Steve Levy

02:27.800 --> 02:34.600
I'm more worried about them. You know, yeah, it's like Levy can have whatever he wants, you know, because he's kid

02:34.600 --> 02:36.600
The world is oyster. He's a millennial

02:37.960 --> 02:42.720
Question is what's up there ass like what is it was it was it a tough night tough tough in line?

02:43.680 --> 02:45.800
It's just a late late late start

02:45.800 --> 02:50.680
I asked him for a pen and paper and I got an envelope with butterflies

02:50.680 --> 02:58.080
Eat an envelopes paper. She's 828. That's what that explains. Yeah, yeah, man

02:58.080 --> 03:04.120
Sorry for the late start. We had some technical stuff. You were told we were we were driving home from Northern California

03:04.120 --> 03:07.320
We got stopped at a fruit inspection and we lost Dan for two hours

03:09.200 --> 03:11.200
Cuz I'm gay

03:11.200 --> 03:19.880
I'm saying you're a delicious you're a delicious fruit. You're like a you're like a nectarine

03:22.320 --> 03:29.920
And gay it's okay, it's all right to be a gay nectarine then this is probably a shitty theater to sit in for a half hour

03:30.560 --> 03:36.920
Like you got popcorn and whatnot. You got that I mean that's that's the thing you get the popcorn and then you're like goddamn

03:36.920 --> 03:38.280
I'm thirsty

03:38.280 --> 03:42.680
And then they're like would you like a la Croix another one? They're three dollars. He wants a water

03:42.680 --> 03:44.680
I got a free water and anybody thirsty

03:45.280 --> 03:48.040
You got one that one guy has one, okay?

03:48.920 --> 03:54.560
I'm thirsty, you know, I got all the water I want back there. I had two la Croix

03:58.000 --> 04:03.280
You think la Croix bad for you if you drink like let's say if you knew a guy who drinks like 18 a day

04:03.280 --> 04:07.760
They're they're bad for you. If you like things that taste good. Oh

04:12.400 --> 04:14.400
Hashtag cold take

04:17.400 --> 04:19.560
How are you Spencer? Oh, I'm great

04:20.080 --> 04:23.160
I was at I was at this restaurant the other night and

04:23.840 --> 04:30.240
In the middle of it the music completely changed and got really really loud and some emcee of sorts was like

04:30.240 --> 04:35.200
Well, everybody we're about to welcome the other Samba dancers and then two

04:35.760 --> 04:40.480
Samba dancers came out and we're just standing in front of the table not standing they danced out

04:40.480 --> 04:46.240
and we're dancing in the front of the table about 10 feet from where I was and it's just the music was was

04:46.560 --> 04:51.320
Unending and it was just so loud and it's like I don't want to look at this because it just seems like a

04:51.680 --> 04:55.040
Spectacle that I don't want to be a part of and I never asked for and I was just looking to eat

04:55.040 --> 05:00.880
You know and it was just it was just a mess and I was just stewing and everyone else was having a fun time

05:00.880 --> 05:05.840
They were taking videos and laughing and stuff. You know, are you whole foods? I was at home

05:05.840 --> 05:11.040
I was at whole food and Chuck E. Cheese. I was at the hot case. You know, they have this barbecue

05:11.040 --> 05:15.500
This barbecue hot case. It's great. They got like lobster Mac

05:15.500 --> 05:22.240
I gotta write my notes down on a butterfly envelope now. There's like what the fuck nobody gives a shit anymore

05:22.240 --> 05:26.720
I mean, it's like it's like, you know, old Uncle Harmon pulled away everyone's pension, you know

05:26.720 --> 05:32.400
Now everybody's nobody's nobody's nobody's nobody's kissing anymore ass like they used to we can't afford notebooks

05:32.400 --> 05:37.280
Okay, we got true colors coming out from I used to bring my own. Yeah, I gave up. I stopped bringing my

05:38.000 --> 05:42.320
So this is on you. Yeah, you don't have the tools that you used to bring

05:42.320 --> 05:46.400
I'm saying is there paper the answer was yes, Jeff

05:46.400 --> 05:54.320
Is there something you'd like me to take a note about because he writes down good names my modified stylus galaxy note 10 plus

05:54.320 --> 05:57.440
Oh, what are you talking about leave me with a vodka? Oh

05:58.320 --> 06:01.120
Don't encourage him. He'll not encourage this

06:03.680 --> 06:05.680
Thank you, Steve

06:05.680 --> 06:08.080
For my butterfly note. Yeah, okay

06:09.840 --> 06:13.360
Why do you have a samsung device, huh? Is it fun?

06:13.360 --> 06:19.680
Yeah, I got this because I miss the old eyeharmon and

06:20.880 --> 06:24.720
I want to I'm gonna fit this with a lanyard and I'm gonna wear it around my neck

06:24.720 --> 06:29.280
No, you're not and I'm gonna remain an iphone user because I don't want to be one of these green bubble people

06:29.440 --> 06:31.680
But I'm just gonna have this around my neck

06:33.120 --> 06:40.160
Because society's left me no choice because there is no such thing as an electronic notepad that is the size of a notepad

06:40.160 --> 06:48.160
There's a million brands of like $30 electronic notepad or baby's first notepad like they're all like eight inches 12 inches

06:48.640 --> 06:53.200
The smallest one I could find is I think called like a moba script or something and it looks everything

06:53.200 --> 06:57.440
It looks like I look like a deaf person from the 1800s like if I wear it around my neck

06:58.320 --> 07:00.320
No offense to the 1800s

07:02.160 --> 07:04.880
Like I'm just saying like it's like a certain dimension of thing

07:04.880 --> 07:10.160
You just look like you look like lora engels wilder and like a very special little house like uh

07:11.040 --> 07:13.040
But you know and this is gonna look

07:13.120 --> 07:15.120
Totally cool

07:15.200 --> 07:16.960
It'll look fine. It's pretty hot

07:16.960 --> 07:22.640
But I think I could take like I think what I can do is I can go I can take like a mead spiral notebook cover

07:23.280 --> 07:26.960
I put it over like I don't know I could make my own custom case

07:27.520 --> 07:32.480
So that it just looks like a guy why does have to be right here neck because I need to as quickly as possible

07:32.480 --> 07:37.520
Perhaps while in the middle of a conversation, but you ain't got time to reach into that pocket

07:38.160 --> 07:44.400
No, you want it to be right right by your sternum in your sifoid process. Yeah, that's correct. Did you want the answer to your question?

07:44.560 --> 07:45.680
Yes

07:45.680 --> 07:52.000
Yeah, because that is correct. It's a matter of milliseconds. Like it's a matter of like hey, jeff take a quick note with your

07:52.480 --> 07:55.200
iPhone. I want you to make a quick note of something about what?

07:56.000 --> 07:58.160
Oh, don't forget, uh, I have Dr.

07:58.160 --> 08:03.520
Javago's showing at the arc light Tuesday while you asked me I reached in my pocket and pulled out

08:03.920 --> 08:06.960
Well, yeah, don't forget to turn it on don't forget to find the fucking app

08:06.960 --> 08:12.880
Don't forget to thumb javago in after the after the seven autocorrects where it says do you mean zimbabwe?

08:13.360 --> 08:15.840
Like oh and the entire time you're doing it

08:15.840 --> 08:21.280
I think you're a tool because it looks like you're tweeting or texting. What was your question about dr. Javago?

08:21.280 --> 08:24.800
I didn't have fucking questions. You did and then you interrupted the fucking answer

08:24.800 --> 08:26.800
There

08:26.800 --> 08:32.560
I want to be able to eliminate the barriers the answer is taster neck between my thoughts and

08:34.320 --> 08:36.320
Containing david lee

08:37.040 --> 08:43.120
So you pull this out. This is my sharif the samsung galaxy note 10 plus. I know all the answers to that shit

08:43.280 --> 08:45.840
It's a thousand dollar electronic notepad

08:46.400 --> 08:51.840
You think about getting that fold one the one that folds it folds and you gotta get that fold

08:51.840 --> 08:55.680
What spencer damn doesn't have time to open up an item

08:56.240 --> 08:58.240
Well, you know

08:58.320 --> 09:05.760
Milliseconds count it has to be unfolded before he even is asked a question. No, I mean I agree 100% with that

09:05.760 --> 09:08.480
That's the reason I used to carry like a moleskin, you know

09:08.640 --> 09:13.360
The s-pen was not fast enough for me. So I super glued a little nipple to it

09:14.320 --> 09:19.280
What does that do it makes it faster to because I like push you push on the s-pen

09:19.280 --> 09:22.400
It's like flush with the bottom and then you gotta like dig it out with your thumbnails

09:22.480 --> 09:25.760
Like what's the point of that? I click so I super glue a little nipple to it

09:26.880 --> 09:31.680
The cool thing about the galaxy note 10 plus. I don't know if like galaxy note 10 9 plus

09:32.400 --> 09:33.840
Had this already but

09:33.840 --> 09:38.960
I'm pleased with the technology now because they've finally managed with a thousand dollars of electronics to actually

09:39.200 --> 09:43.200
Surpass a regular notebook because you don't have to turn a page

09:43.440 --> 09:44.800
But you can do everything else

09:44.800 --> 09:51.280
You pick it up. You take the fucking pen out as soon as you do it goes into a mode that you can write any kind of

09:51.280 --> 09:54.160
Fucking aids shit, whatever. No, it's whatever

09:55.200 --> 09:59.200
And and then you can give your phone. I didn't have to do anything

09:59.200 --> 10:04.400
But take the pen out as with a regular thing and then when I put it back in it saves it goes back to sleep

10:04.560 --> 10:06.560
Boom, bam

10:06.560 --> 10:14.240
Hell yeah, congratulations samsung you've beaten the fucking 1950s notebook

10:14.720 --> 10:20.400
Finally god damn it with this technology. It's like it's like it's like nobody ever nobody ever makes anything for me

10:22.720 --> 10:25.280
You know there goes a million kinds of like there's a you know

10:25.280 --> 10:31.600
They got the technology necessary to make an interactive whiteboard that stores all of your the prices of breaking a story

10:31.600 --> 10:36.560
I could have I you know how much you know how much magic's going on up here that's everyone missed out on

10:36.640 --> 10:40.320
I'm like semi-retired now. No one's ever going to know how I did what I did

10:41.520 --> 10:43.520
All right, but they could

10:43.840 --> 10:49.760
God, they'd be so excited. Have you have you tried writing things down on butterfly envelope?

10:51.040 --> 10:52.320
I can't do it

10:52.320 --> 10:56.240
I can't do it because then I'll have a butterfly envelope with some shit written on it

10:56.240 --> 11:02.160
And then it's like oh, what should I take a photo of this bring it into an app that scans it with ocr

11:02.400 --> 11:08.000
And fucking like turns that into text. It's like go blow it out your ass world. What? Yeah

11:08.640 --> 11:10.640
All right, there's no guests tonight

11:11.680 --> 11:14.480
Or you think like molly shannon's gonna walk out after all this like

11:15.200 --> 11:17.040
Yeah

11:17.040 --> 11:19.920
It was weird at first, but lauren's okay sometimes

11:19.920 --> 11:25.920
Someone go do do do uh, no you get nothing. No, it's not true. Damn. It's not true

11:26.160 --> 11:29.280
We made these people wait for half hour before we came out

11:29.600 --> 11:33.760
We're gonna get these mother fuckers the greatest Harmontown that they've ever seen

11:34.800 --> 11:36.800
Whoa

11:37.200 --> 11:40.880
I say and I I put this in spencer's court

11:42.000 --> 11:46.800
Spencer did not bring any character sheets but spencer. What if we just played some full-on d&d right now?

11:46.800 --> 11:50.560
What if we really like like really just knuckled down?

11:51.280 --> 11:57.680
Like like what could we remember everything that we need to know? I know you can't but we could play without having that

11:57.840 --> 11:59.840
Okay, or you could use me

12:00.640 --> 12:02.640

12:59.120 --> 13:01.120
I can't stay mad at you

13:01.520 --> 13:03.520
memory sprite senior

13:04.640 --> 13:11.840
Wait, it's his dad. I was your dad the whole time. This has been incest pouring my favorite

13:11.840 --> 13:13.840
Yay

13:13.920 --> 13:15.920
One billion porn hub users can't be wrong

13:18.080 --> 13:25.760
So it wasn't just incest for no, no, it was just incest pouring but but underneath the guys of two cars fucking

13:27.200 --> 13:31.520
Well, I know they there was there was one guy fucking another guy with a car

13:32.400 --> 13:35.040
Using a car is like a marital aid, but you said it was

13:36.320 --> 13:40.080
It was senior it was uh memory sprite senior

13:40.080 --> 13:46.400
I don't know. How do you picture memory sprite? You think he's a car? I I don't think so. I mean, I'm not telling you how to imagine

13:47.840 --> 13:49.360
If you pictured a car fine

13:49.360 --> 13:53.600
I pictured like a little tinkerbell, but like uh kind of an androgynous tinkerbell

13:53.840 --> 13:59.360
And then was fucked by a fatherly car and they well I pictured like a just a dude pulling up in a car

14:00.000 --> 14:03.840
Going like getting the car. So this wasn't car base at all. It was just straight incest pouring

14:04.560 --> 14:07.120
Car was played a pivotal role

14:07.120 --> 14:14.400
But it wasn't like a character. Oh, they weren't they weren't like Voltron. They weren't they were they were they weren't they weren't cars themselves

14:14.400 --> 14:16.400
Well, they were like Voltron in a way

14:17.440 --> 14:19.440
Yeah, I mean, yeah

14:20.320 --> 14:25.040
They did there were parts that the women interlocked together to form a different thing

14:25.200 --> 14:30.720
But it wasn't really a defender of the universe. It was uh, it was a sprite with a car up his ass

14:30.720 --> 14:32.720
Uh

14:35.440 --> 14:40.320

16:13.120 --> 16:15.120
I

16:19.040 --> 16:21.040
Even I know this isn't noteworthy to

16:22.160 --> 16:25.760
To my discredit I haven't written enough down. I wrote down memory sprites

16:26.640 --> 16:32.000
Uh, so the guy driving the car has another car that he put inside the car that he puts in your ass

16:33.040 --> 16:38.880
You're making it so complicated. There's a guy in a car. It's just like anybody puts the car that he's driving in your ass

16:38.880 --> 16:44.480
Yeah, he said he said because he said get in the car where I'm going to put the car in you

17:52.400 --> 17:55.680
But the memory sprite seniors Dracula is what I'm getting from this

17:55.680 --> 18:02.480
Uh, where'd you get that that just isn't that I I inferred the wrong thing. Oh, I

18:03.040 --> 18:05.040
Cucumbers or what? Yeah

18:08.400 --> 18:14.480
Why why don't a vegetable patch? Are they so comfortable together now that they're just going to spend the night together at a

18:14.480 --> 18:17.120
At a Holiday Inn Suite or and what's going on?

18:17.120 --> 18:23.040
Yeah, I think they live together and the the he's he's in bed reading like his ipad. He's checking out the news

They live together, but he's like does feed six sixteen things famous people did they haven't tried anymore

18:30.720 --> 18:37.680
But memory sprite was in a car up a but at one point before this right. That was chapter one. Yeah, that was

18:37.760 --> 18:42.480
Chapter one. Okay. Now they're home. Oh, oh home, but I thought they were at a Holiday Inn

18:43.360 --> 18:48.080
No, I I inferred that I implied that. Well, it was very obvious by the text

18:48.080 --> 18:56.240
But did they did they know each other when they met when the car pulled up and said their father and son

18:57.360 --> 18:59.360
But you didn't find that out until the very end

19:00.720 --> 19:02.720
Okay, that was the bloat of chapter one

19:07.040 --> 19:09.040
Father and son

What Seth Rogen? What are you doing in this scene?

25:28.400 --> 25:34.000
I don't know. That's not really traditionally you don't have like like like clips where an actor just popped by it

25:34.000 --> 25:41.840
But I did what I could on the fly. All right. Yeah, so thanks for thanks Jeff for teeing me up for all that

25:46.080 --> 25:51.360
Man, so I just watched the second Adams family movie you guys

25:52.160 --> 25:54.160
These guys are fucking twisted

25:54.240 --> 25:56.320
Like morticia Adams

25:56.320 --> 26:00.320
She gives birth and like during labor. She's like into it

26:00.320 --> 26:06.800
Which I was like I was the whole movie. I was thinking about that. I'm like that's so funny like when do you ever see

26:07.360 --> 26:12.560
You know pregnancy and the birth giving process is like pleasurable at night. Like she's like, yeah

26:13.040 --> 26:19.360
I'm loving this because you know usually someone's screaming bloody murder or it's like kind of done in in uh, what do you call it?

26:19.840 --> 26:24.240
Like uh without any words, you know, you just hear music because non spooky

26:24.240 --> 26:30.480
Uh women when they give birth they're like, oh, this is scary. It's painful and I don't like it. She's like, oh

26:30.560 --> 26:37.600
I'm gonna love it ripped up. I love everything that hurts. Yeah. I love childbirth. That's a really that's foggy, man

26:37.840 --> 26:43.280
No, that's it's funny. It's funny. It's like, oh, I love childbirth because it hurts. Yeah

26:43.600 --> 26:47.200
Because that's how well there's a child, but then did she look at the baby and go?

26:48.400 --> 26:50.400
Gross, I think she does. Yeah

26:50.400 --> 26:57.200
I think they do that. It's so innocent and then the and then the the the Dracula doctor's like, but it could end up like murder

26:57.760 --> 26:59.760
And she's like, okay

27:00.160 --> 27:03.040
Then I love it and then I love it as much as cold soup

27:04.160 --> 27:06.160
That's your name cold soup

27:07.840 --> 27:11.120
Yeah, that's what happens. It's a great. It's a great film

27:12.480 --> 27:15.920
And then and then uh, uh gomez comes in and goes honey

27:15.920 --> 27:20.640
I just heard the polar ice caps are melting. Oh good

27:22.400 --> 27:28.960
Yes, this global warming is really the cat's pajamas because they just love bad stuff. Yeah, it's it's so good. Yeah

27:29.760 --> 27:34.320
They're like, uh, the kids are trying to kill the baby and it's horrifying, but the baby doesn't die

27:34.400 --> 27:36.400
And so then it's fine and not horrifying

27:36.880 --> 27:38.880
They probably can't die

27:38.960 --> 27:42.000
Yeah, more or less it like stops at guillotine with its bare hand

27:42.000 --> 27:46.880
What it's like a superhero baby because otherwise it would die and that would be horrible

27:48.400 --> 27:53.600
Otherwise they'd just be killing a baby on do you think that's how the the thing not the thing thing

27:53.840 --> 27:59.280
They're their hand character. The maybe that that was one of their first kids and like

27:59.840 --> 28:01.200
Pugsley and

28:01.200 --> 28:06.480
Wednesday, what's your name Wednesday that they successfully they put it in guillotine and it reached up with his hand

28:06.480 --> 28:08.400
But it didn't have steel skin

28:08.400 --> 28:14.560
So it just got its hands covered and then they're like, what are you doing? Did you kids murder your your our baby?

28:15.280 --> 28:16.880
We had to

28:16.880 --> 28:23.360
Come here. You wonderful kids. I love murder because we're adam's take after my your dad or whatever

28:23.680 --> 28:25.680
Well, we'll just put the hand in a box

28:26.400 --> 28:33.520
And it'll be our friend. What's uh, what's uh, what's pugsley's deal in this movie? He's like a mean kid

28:34.160 --> 28:36.320
he's he's often he's often uh

28:36.320 --> 28:40.800
Uh, a victim of Wednesday's sadistic schemes, right?

28:41.440 --> 28:45.360
But the but does he have a power does he know he's just kind of a

28:46.000 --> 28:49.520
He's a dumb. He's like dumb his main his main thing. He's like dumb

28:49.760 --> 28:54.720
He can he can he can he can like dangle weights from his pierced dick

28:54.720 --> 29:04.960
He's really they don't they don't show that in the movies because he's like a kid in the movies. Yeah

29:06.400 --> 29:10.240
But in the comic book in the Alan Moore original material

29:11.040 --> 29:13.520
He's like 30 and he works at a carnival

29:15.520 --> 29:21.280
And he he does like body modifications. He fucking loves sounding. He can't get enough sounding. What is that?

29:21.280 --> 29:26.160
Wait, what is that? I think it's when you you like insert rods into your urethra. Oh

29:27.280 --> 29:29.280
Pugsley loves that's too far

29:32.400 --> 29:36.080
No, it's painful. You just made a father fuck a child with a car

29:38.160 --> 29:40.160
But not a rod

29:41.360 --> 29:46.080
I don't like that rod. No, isn't that uncomfortable to think about too much true crime?

29:46.080 --> 29:51.600
Yeah, there's too many true crime stories with uh, yeah, it's like there was like some guy that like tortured kids

29:51.680 --> 29:53.120
It was like that

29:53.120 --> 29:56.000
How much weight then do you think and like let's say like

29:57.760 --> 30:00.240
Am I gonna gain yeah, how much weight?

30:01.120 --> 30:04.800
Like in kilograms or pounds. Do you think you could dangle from your dick? Oh

30:06.560 --> 30:11.840
I don't think I feel like zero like I don't I don't I don't feel like even a pound

30:11.840 --> 30:17.440
Like I don't let's say you had a very comfortable rod already in there. I don't that was nice

30:17.440 --> 30:20.880
That was like structurally like sterilized and good to go

30:21.520 --> 30:28.240
You could like you could put like like, you know a couple ounces on that probably I don't I don't think so

30:28.320 --> 30:32.160
I could do like maybe two pounds. I feel you think you're gonna shoot. I think I can maybe

30:33.920 --> 30:35.920
Well, how long are we talking?

30:37.360 --> 30:40.000
Like is that all day because I don't know I I think

30:40.000 --> 30:44.960
I think five five seconds. Yeah, I think two pounds the time doesn't matter

30:45.360 --> 30:49.200
It's not like a slowly rip your dick off like right. That's what I'm saying

30:49.920 --> 30:55.440
Oh, I know I I'm just like like like no like the problems that are gonna happen are gonna happen right away

30:57.040 --> 31:00.720
And so I'm like no no pounds no no pounds

31:01.600 --> 31:04.400
Uh, what about you Jeff? Let's say that you

31:04.400 --> 31:10.480
Could cure leukemia if you dangled five pounds of weight off your cock

31:11.360 --> 31:16.000
For 15 seconds. I'd do that. I'm not letting you this is a gotcha question

31:18.720 --> 31:21.920
You you'd rather let people die of leukemia. There's children out there day

31:21.920 --> 31:27.360
I didn't say that I didn't say that and your dick is so precious to you that you couldn't dangle five pounds of weight off of it

31:27.680 --> 31:33.360
I don't I don't I'm not buying into your scenario. I think leukemia is caused by disingenuous friendships

31:33.360 --> 31:35.360
Oh

31:35.680 --> 31:37.680
All right, uh

31:38.240 --> 31:40.800
I'd like to bring up our first guest. Timmy. Uh, no

31:44.080 --> 31:46.080
He could have made it today

31:49.600 --> 31:52.960
Either because I refused to mutilate myself or because Jeff

31:55.760 --> 32:02.000
Um, yeah, well moving right along got a lot of show to get through here tonight. So let's keep it moving

32:02.000 --> 32:07.600
Uh, Jeff, what does your envelope say so far? It says well, it's not a whole lot

32:08.640 --> 32:10.640
It says memory sprite and father

32:11.680 --> 32:15.360
Dangle weights from his penis. Hey, you wrote that down. I

32:16.400 --> 32:22.080
I usually write just things down you just write him down and you but then did you write it down before you set it?

32:22.400 --> 32:25.760
No, I write it down and think later on if it's a callback

32:26.320 --> 32:30.960
Like I can look at the thing but right now I'm too dazzled by the fact there's butterflies everywhere

32:30.960 --> 32:35.040
And so normally I have a lot more notes than than just those two things

32:35.920 --> 32:38.080
Did you you guys know about the feral hog?

32:39.760 --> 32:45.520
I gotta shoot like the guy that had to shoot he had to murder 30 to 50 feral hogs in the space of five minutes or something

32:45.600 --> 32:47.760
Well, anybody listen to that podcast reply all

32:48.800 --> 32:53.680
Yeah, that's kind of fun. What happened? Uh, well, there was this kind of I don't know if you call it a meme

32:53.760 --> 32:56.240
There was like a trope a thing a phenomenon

32:56.240 --> 33:01.040
On online where like there was some there was some assault rifle talk going on on twitter

33:01.040 --> 33:04.560
And then there was a guy no one needs an assault rifle. Who needs an assault rifle?

33:04.720 --> 33:07.600
And then someone's tweeted and said a question for

33:08.400 --> 33:10.080
rural

33:10.080 --> 33:12.000
America

33:12.000 --> 33:16.000
How do I deal with the 30 to 50 feral hogs that run into my yard?

33:16.000 --> 33:20.640
Well, my two to three children are playing every 10 minutes or whatever the fuck something really specific

33:20.640 --> 33:22.960
And everybody was like having a gas with it because it was kind of silly

33:22.960 --> 33:26.560
It just seemed like a guy that was just making up a reason why you wouldn't need an assault rifle

33:27.520 --> 33:34.480
And he was but but but then the reply all podcast, which is which is really great. It's a great podcast like

33:36.080 --> 33:40.960
It as it as it always does like it just went down the rabbit hole of that story first

33:41.600 --> 33:48.800
Contacting that guy who as always on reply all turns out to be a wonderful human being who's like totally gets why it's funny

33:48.800 --> 33:54.800
He's like it's like he's like do you understand why everyone like was like retweeting it Megan was like, yeah

33:54.800 --> 34:00.160
No, it's a it's a it's a ridiculous tweet like I was I was like what's ridiculous to you about it's like

34:00.160 --> 34:03.520
Well, it's just the first of all 30 to 50 is a weird number

34:04.320 --> 34:09.360
Like he ran down the whole thing. It was like they but but also the guy was like, you know

34:09.360 --> 34:16.000
It's like oh shit this feral hog thing is a real thing and he did have that experience basically he didn't have an assault rifle

34:16.640 --> 34:17.760
um

34:17.760 --> 34:23.360
But he was just sort of like in the moment. He was like from his own life experience is like saying

34:23.600 --> 34:25.600
Here's a reason you'd need an assault rifle

34:26.640 --> 34:32.320
And and then and then so then the episode continues to just go into this whole feral hog thing which is fucking

34:32.880 --> 34:34.480
fascinating

34:34.480 --> 34:41.040
So the spaniards when they came when they when they were conquist adoring or whatever like they would they would like

34:41.600 --> 34:43.600
Conquering is that problematic

34:43.600 --> 34:49.680
Um, they would I guess it was like a a medieval thing to like you would bring pigs with you

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
And this is already cool like

34:52.640 --> 34:54.640
Like like this is such this is such weird like

34:55.200 --> 34:59.440
Minecrafty kind of like what was it modern-ish kind of thinking like the

35:00.240 --> 35:05.440
guys who were in the business of of like colonial imperialistic just like fucking world

35:06.080 --> 35:08.080
Paving like they would just bring

35:08.080 --> 35:17.440
Hogs with them because they fuck like rabbits and they're they turn everything they eat into bacon which you and and so they

35:17.760 --> 35:20.480
You just take a couple pigs with you when you get on a ship

35:20.880 --> 35:25.440
And wherever you land if there's a forest you kick their little asses out of the boat

35:25.600 --> 35:31.200
You know, they're gonna go fuck and like raise like the pigs are like the fastest reproducing

35:32.080 --> 35:35.600
mammals or something like that which I find astonishing and uh

35:35.600 --> 35:38.720
And the way they describe it is like they basically do all the foraging

35:38.720 --> 35:46.000
You would otherwise have to do and they turn every acorn leaf insect. They turn it all into one big mobile fucking pork unit

35:46.560 --> 35:49.360
Um, and and and and they wouldn't um

35:50.160 --> 35:52.160
They wouldn't build pens

35:52.880 --> 35:54.880
mobile

35:57.040 --> 35:58.560
Jeff's writing it down

35:58.560 --> 36:03.200
I want to see the day when that comes in handy when somebody like stumbles up to you on a sidewalk

36:03.200 --> 36:07.120
Goes like what did he say about that and you're like this is mobile pork unit

36:08.080 --> 36:12.400
Um, he's getting a little little little creased up envelope in your in your in your pocket

36:12.560 --> 36:19.200
But but I just think that's fascinating because particularly it's um, it's not what we associate with like agrarian society

36:19.280 --> 36:22.560
It was like they would let the pigs they wanted them to flourish

36:22.640 --> 36:27.280
Right, so it was like it was a sort of like you let the pigs out into the wild

36:27.680 --> 36:32.000
And then you start conquist adoring knowing that wherever you go

36:32.000 --> 36:36.480
As you're looking for your fountains of youth or whatever the fuck you're doing like that

36:36.720 --> 36:43.120
You've now seeded this land with these mobile fucking pork units. You're just gonna run across them

36:43.120 --> 36:47.040
They're easy to hunt. They've they've turned everything into port and you just go

36:47.680 --> 36:52.240
And you and you just eat it and then you keep moving. I I just find like so like

36:52.960 --> 36:54.080
Like

36:54.080 --> 37:00.000
Disgustingly human like it's such a beautiful thing and now we're suffering for it like all these centuries later these are

37:00.000 --> 37:04.240
There's there's like there was a sort of like dormant pig population

37:04.720 --> 37:08.640
Um, and here's the craziest most ironic thing about it

37:09.040 --> 37:13.520
So so that when the feral pig problem suddenly starts to blossom in the united states

37:13.920 --> 37:18.240
The first instinct given our lessons we've learned from the passenger pigeon and thing you just go

37:18.400 --> 37:26.640
This is easy. We know what to do open season on feral pigs have added america and uh, a little problem there like, uh

37:26.640 --> 37:29.840
Uh, cunts are also killing pigs is like

37:31.840 --> 37:35.680
It's if you're if you're down for killing like it is the

37:36.400 --> 37:39.520
Open season on pigs is like way cooler than open season on pigeons

37:39.840 --> 37:45.600
Like like you get to now take quarter sticks of dynamite and create booby traps where pigs are flying in the air

37:45.920 --> 37:49.360
You you get to pop in a helicopter and have a headset and just go

37:49.360 --> 37:56.320
Brrrrrrrrrr. Um, like they fuck so fast. They're ready to fuck again in six months after they're born

37:56.880 --> 38:01.200
Um, and they're like the but here's the crazy irony to it

38:01.920 --> 38:09.280
The reason they're spreading out of control is because it's legal to hunt them and it's fun to hunt them for some people

38:09.440 --> 38:14.320
like tourists and things like there's a thriving business and industry

38:14.800 --> 38:17.120
it's kind of like the poaching thing where it's like

38:17.120 --> 38:22.680
There are people in the world who never want these things to go extinct because they now

38:22.680 --> 38:31.200
have a way to make lots of money, i.e. charging tickets to bring you along to fuck up pigs

38:31.200 --> 38:33.200
and your weird jigsaw, sociopathic tendencies.

38:33.200 --> 38:40.080
I know a couple chefs that they pay to go out and hunt wild boar so they can get boar

38:40.080 --> 38:42.920
bacon and render boar fat.

38:42.920 --> 38:50.960
There are farmers out there whose videos are almost indistinguishable from the horrible

38:50.960 --> 38:56.200
kind of guys who are laughing with glee as they're blowing up these pigs, but the difference

38:56.200 --> 39:01.800
is there are farmers out there who wish they were just all gone and who are not enjoying

39:01.800 --> 39:07.120
killing thousands of them a week going out four nights a week at three in the morning

39:07.120 --> 39:12.360
on three wheelers with assault rifles going on and just night vision and apparently these

39:12.360 --> 39:15.600
things are so smart you can't trap them the same way twice.

39:15.600 --> 39:21.960
If you trap a pig and another pig sees it, no other pig is ever going to fall for that

39:21.960 --> 39:22.960
trap.

39:22.960 --> 39:30.800
It sounds like a joke, but it's like if they build a house out of straw, another one's

39:30.800 --> 39:34.800
got one made out of brick the next day, it's crazy.

39:34.800 --> 39:38.720
They tried introducing wolves into the wild and now we just got homeless pigs, that's

39:38.720 --> 39:39.720
it.

39:39.720 --> 39:44.520
You have a bunch of dudes with guns running around killing pigs, but they're breeding

39:44.520 --> 39:45.520
faster.

39:45.520 --> 39:53.320
Well, also, these guys, but it's like that's the super irony to me is like they, like the

39:53.320 --> 39:58.600
guy in Jurassic Park 3, it's like they abscond with fucking pigs, like they breed them and

39:58.600 --> 40:00.840
they spread them.

40:00.840 --> 40:07.200
Because they're bread and butter, pork is their bread and butter.

40:07.200 --> 40:12.080
Here's something crazy, here's how huge the problem is Jeff.

40:12.080 --> 40:21.640
PETA and the national feral hog genocide enthusiasts, I don't know what they're called, like the

40:21.640 --> 40:28.920
American Farmers Association who are suffering the brunt of this infestation, PETA and those

40:28.920 --> 40:31.720
guys are arm in arm.

40:31.720 --> 40:40.840
Just because even PETA is like, this madness has to stop and it has to stop in the most

40:40.840 --> 40:43.280
humane way possible.

40:43.280 --> 40:47.440
They lobby together, that's how fucked up the situation is.

40:47.440 --> 40:53.040
And there are people that are like, let's poison them all, but to poison a thing that

40:53.040 --> 40:57.680
is like the size of a human means, what are you going to use?

40:57.680 --> 40:59.880
How much rat poison are you going to put?

40:59.880 --> 41:02.080
And then it's like this crazy thing.

41:02.080 --> 41:05.120
And that's actually the point we've gotten to, that's the end of the story is that actually

41:05.120 --> 41:10.480
even the people that are environmentalists who are like, if you poison these pig population

41:10.480 --> 41:16.640
enough to try to wipe them out, it means poisoning the earth around them, it means poisoning

41:16.640 --> 41:21.840
the entire biosphere, everything that eats those carcasses, all the plant life.

41:21.840 --> 41:28.880
And those people are even saying at this point, it's the only practical alternative to what

41:28.880 --> 41:32.320
could actually be a really serious human impacting thing.

41:32.320 --> 41:39.280
So the story compares it to the decision to do chemo, where you're just like, I'm just

41:39.280 --> 41:46.920
going to attack myself with something that kills everything and maybe won't kill me as

41:46.920 --> 41:54.720
much as it kills this thing because the feral pig problem is like that real, crazy.

41:54.720 --> 41:59.280
This has been me recapping a podcast you should listen to.

41:59.280 --> 42:01.640
Now you don't have to listen to that episode.

42:01.640 --> 42:08.000
It's our new segment called Mobile Pork Units, I read it down so I could remember.

42:08.000 --> 42:12.600
Some people, Cody at one point said, you know, we drink too much LaCroix and like it's got

42:12.600 --> 42:14.120
like insecticide in it or something.

42:14.120 --> 42:17.160
I said, that sounds like fucking garbage talk.

42:17.160 --> 42:18.160
What is it?

42:18.160 --> 42:22.320
It's like flavored with oil, essential oil, citrus things or something and everything

42:22.320 --> 42:26.200
that has citrus in it has pesticides in it, I guess, I don't know.

42:26.200 --> 42:30.960
So it's like, I think I'm drinking 12 cans of water, but really I'm drinking 12 cans

42:30.960 --> 42:32.880
of water with a little pesticide in it.

42:32.880 --> 42:33.880
Big deal.

42:33.880 --> 42:34.880
You got to get it somewhere.

42:34.880 --> 42:35.880
BFD.

42:35.880 --> 42:38.200
You got to get your pesticide something.

42:38.200 --> 42:39.200
Yeah.

42:39.200 --> 42:40.640
Can I get a LaCroix out here?

42:40.640 --> 42:41.640
I got a craving.

42:41.640 --> 42:43.440
Like I just I'm addicted to LaCroix.

42:43.440 --> 42:45.000
What flavors do you like it on?

42:45.000 --> 42:46.000
I like them all.

42:46.000 --> 42:47.240
You're gnawing on that lime.

42:47.240 --> 42:49.080
Yeah, I mean, I like lime.

42:49.080 --> 42:52.720
I don't want, I don't want to pick a favorite flavor of LaCroix because I'm afraid then

42:52.720 --> 43:06.720
I'll be like, oh, Barry, you know, passion fruit, man, what even is a passion fruit?

43:06.720 --> 43:08.200
It's me.

43:08.200 --> 43:11.160
Oh, no, memory sprite.

43:11.160 --> 43:18.560
He checked his notes, those notes, the notes came in handy.

43:18.560 --> 43:27.760
For all hogs, for all hogs, I like when environmentally there's a pest that was brought in by accident,

43:27.760 --> 43:36.560
like, like the Spanish brought in like hogs or like, and they terrorize the countryside.

43:36.560 --> 43:41.920
So they go, oh, what you do is you bring in a bunch of snakes and the snakes go fucking

43:41.920 --> 43:43.600
crazy and start killing everything.

43:43.600 --> 43:48.520
And then you go, you know, you need condors and then the condors are supposed to kill

43:48.520 --> 43:49.520
the snakes.

43:49.520 --> 43:52.720
But the condors sleep at night when the snakes are out killing everybody.

43:52.720 --> 43:57.280
And then you have to go, then you have to get a bunch of hunters to go kill the condors

43:57.280 --> 43:59.520
because they're eating every fucking, everything else.

43:59.520 --> 44:05.760
Yeah, I like when people just don't think ahead and everything's just gone to shit.

44:05.760 --> 44:06.760
I like that.

44:06.760 --> 44:07.760
Yeah.

44:07.760 --> 44:08.760
I love that.

44:08.760 --> 44:12.600
Like, what's the one like, they're like in Australia or New Zealand?

44:12.600 --> 44:13.600
Kento.

44:13.600 --> 44:14.600
Kento.

44:14.600 --> 44:15.600
Toads.

44:15.600 --> 44:16.600
Yeah.

44:16.600 --> 44:22.000
And then they brought in like a marsupial, like, like a fucking something to go eat them.

44:22.000 --> 44:24.720
But like, no, but they're nocturnal.

44:24.720 --> 44:30.080
So while one's asleep, the other one's awake, like, now everything's fucked.

44:30.080 --> 44:31.560
Can you imagine what it takes?

44:31.560 --> 44:35.960
Then you got to bring in Richard Attenborough, everything's fucked now in Australia.

44:35.960 --> 44:36.960
Yeah.

44:36.960 --> 44:44.800
Imagine what it takes to destabilize the Australian biosphere, like where 70% of everything is

44:44.800 --> 44:45.800
a poison spider.

44:45.800 --> 44:53.000
Also, they don't even know what a knife is.

44:53.000 --> 44:57.320
I mean, some people do, but I would think you could introduce anything from the world

44:57.320 --> 45:02.240
to the Australian biosphere, and it would bounce off like a ping pong ball, like, oh,

45:02.240 --> 45:03.240
no, I can't.

45:03.240 --> 45:05.240
There's poison spiders here.

45:05.240 --> 45:10.720
Like, but no, some, some fucking toad like is wreaking havoc on I think it's like the

45:10.720 --> 45:15.400
opposite where they have they have several problems caused by several invasive species

45:15.400 --> 45:18.840
and it's like every one of those just really hit the ground running and now it's fucked.

45:18.840 --> 45:22.640
Because like the Galapagos, like they're like a macro Galapagos where it's like they're

45:22.640 --> 45:27.800
so isolated that they have key and tumbler kind of like evolution going.

45:27.800 --> 45:35.220
Marsupials, case in point, the fucking giant rat with human biceps that like knock on your

45:35.220 --> 45:36.720
patio door.

45:36.720 --> 45:39.040
God damn those YouTube videos.

45:39.040 --> 45:40.560
Yeah, that's boy.

45:40.560 --> 45:42.080
Get the fuck out of here.

45:42.080 --> 45:43.720
Get out of here.

45:43.720 --> 45:44.720
Get the fuck out.

45:44.720 --> 45:45.720
Yeah, fuck.

45:45.720 --> 45:46.720
What?

45:46.720 --> 45:53.680
It's like the fucking like seven foot fucking rat monsters that are just like banging on

45:53.680 --> 45:54.680
their glasses.

45:54.680 --> 45:57.560
Like if you type it into YouTube, there's just like seven videos and it's just like everyone

45:57.560 --> 45:58.560
just reacts the same way.

45:58.560 --> 46:01.720
They're like, ah, you again, get the fuck out of here.

46:01.720 --> 46:02.720
Get out of here.

46:02.720 --> 46:04.720
I'm sick and tired of you.

46:04.720 --> 46:07.400
You're sick and tired of fucking Pennywise.

46:07.400 --> 46:09.720
Like that's fucking great.

46:09.720 --> 46:14.600
You get this guy's got spiders that crawl up the wall with birds in their mouths.

46:14.600 --> 46:15.600
It's unfair.

46:15.600 --> 46:16.600
Dinkum unfair.

46:16.600 --> 46:27.840
Dinkum that was in your notes, a like that hit might still got it.

46:27.840 --> 46:31.280
You still got it nine eleven nine eleven.

46:31.280 --> 46:35.040
We're burning through this episode if I get you know what Spencer?

46:35.040 --> 46:36.040
You know what?

46:36.040 --> 46:37.040
These colors do run.

46:37.040 --> 46:38.040
Whoa.

46:38.040 --> 46:41.600
Man kangaroos look like fucking werewolves.

46:41.600 --> 46:47.440
I always forget new rule.

46:47.440 --> 46:48.600
Forget it.

46:48.600 --> 46:53.240
Let's forget Spencer without character sheets without anything.

46:53.240 --> 46:58.440
Let's play D&D and you're going to have to walk us through it and give us a you're going

46:58.440 --> 46:59.440
to be freestyling.

46:59.440 --> 47:02.000
You don't have a you don't have a dungeon chart.

47:02.000 --> 47:03.160
I don't have a dungeon.

47:03.160 --> 47:06.320
I might have some notes on my phone.

47:06.320 --> 47:08.080
That might be some relevant stuff.

47:08.080 --> 47:14.200
You guys be down for a little freestyle D&D because we're running short on time.

47:14.200 --> 47:16.080
The shot clock is ticking on Harmontown right now.

47:16.080 --> 47:21.080
I think I think it's going to be our few opportunities to play a little D&D.

47:21.080 --> 47:24.440
I'll I'll tee up some Spencer music.

47:24.440 --> 47:25.440
Wait, hold on.

47:25.440 --> 47:28.640
I might be able to play play something on your jack.

47:28.640 --> 47:29.640
Can I do that?

47:29.640 --> 47:31.640
That's what she said.

47:31.640 --> 47:32.640
What?

47:32.640 --> 47:33.640
Yeah.

47:33.640 --> 47:34.640
Do you need my jack?

47:34.640 --> 47:35.640
I have.

47:35.640 --> 47:36.800
I have a recap song.

47:36.800 --> 47:38.920
Wait, you can play it?

47:38.920 --> 47:40.120
Oh, shit.

47:40.120 --> 47:41.120
We could play.

47:41.120 --> 47:44.680
We have the technology to play a recap of our last session.

47:44.680 --> 47:49.560
Oh, well, allegedly, I just said that and now it's going to shit the bed.

47:49.560 --> 47:56.040
I'm drawing a little guy on my galaxy note.

47:56.040 --> 47:59.040
Mobile pork units.

47:59.040 --> 48:00.040
That's not right.

48:00.040 --> 48:01.040
That's not right.

48:01.040 --> 48:03.040
My phone hasn't updated.

48:03.040 --> 48:10.600
We've got the D&D on the recap.

48:10.600 --> 48:14.200
Who hit who with the sword plus 10?

48:14.200 --> 48:24.400
Who's going for a back of holding again D&D D&D.

48:24.400 --> 48:27.840
Who's going down to the dungeon tonight?

48:27.840 --> 48:29.080
Who saw a dragon?

48:29.080 --> 48:30.640
Who's looking for a fight?

48:30.640 --> 48:33.640
What's your character's name?

48:33.640 --> 48:34.640
Berlin.

48:34.640 --> 48:39.640
What's my character's name?

48:39.640 --> 48:40.640
Chad.

48:40.640 --> 48:41.640
Oh, yeah.

48:41.640 --> 48:42.640
Thank you.

48:42.640 --> 48:43.640
D&D.

48:43.640 --> 48:44.640
Pilot gold.

48:44.640 --> 48:45.640
Pilot gold.

48:45.640 --> 48:59.640
I got my sword and it's got two barrels and a trigger Woody Harrelson is coming up.

48:59.640 --> 49:05.640
He's coming up in me.

49:05.640 --> 49:06.640
Double tap.

49:06.640 --> 49:07.640
Zombieland 2.

49:07.640 --> 49:08.640
Wow.

49:08.640 --> 49:09.640
Yeah.

49:09.640 --> 49:10.640
I agree.

49:10.640 --> 49:11.640
I agree.

49:11.640 --> 49:22.640
We should bring out Steve Levy as Diarrhea Jr. shouldn't we?

49:22.640 --> 49:25.640
Steve Levy.

49:25.640 --> 49:41.640
You got the same color shirt.

49:41.640 --> 49:43.640
Oh, damn.

49:43.640 --> 49:45.640
Is that me?

49:45.640 --> 49:47.640
Could be.

49:47.640 --> 49:49.640
Really could.

49:49.640 --> 49:51.640
I could work on Venice Beach.

49:51.640 --> 49:52.640
How's this?

49:52.640 --> 49:56.640
I remember that this Jew fro I got going on.

49:56.640 --> 49:59.640
You didn't, you haven't really made any comments about it.

49:59.640 --> 50:00.640
It's really unruly.

50:00.640 --> 50:04.640
I wish I was Jewish so I could just say Jew, Jew, Jew all the time.

50:04.640 --> 50:06.640
I just want to say everything to Jew.

50:06.640 --> 50:07.640
I'm a Jew.

50:07.640 --> 50:08.640
It sounds so dirty.

50:08.640 --> 50:09.640
It's not really fro-y though.

50:09.640 --> 50:11.640
It's just, it's just bushy.

50:11.640 --> 50:13.640
It's not like, you're not fro-y.

50:13.640 --> 50:16.640
Give me some of that Jew food, mom.

50:16.640 --> 50:17.640
I don't.

50:17.640 --> 50:21.640
What's your favorite Jew food, Steve?

50:21.640 --> 50:22.640
Do you like a latke?

50:22.640 --> 50:23.640
What do you like?

50:23.640 --> 50:25.640
Yeah, like a latke and applesauce.

50:25.640 --> 50:31.640
A nice, you know, pastrami, corned beef sandwich.

50:31.640 --> 50:35.640
Your Jew fro is kind of like, it's molded.

50:35.640 --> 50:38.640
Like, are you trying to do something with it?

50:38.640 --> 50:39.640
No, I just think it's wavy.

50:39.640 --> 50:40.640
It has a mind of its own.

50:40.640 --> 50:41.640
It's wavy and thick.

50:41.640 --> 50:43.640
I don't think you're fro-ing out.

50:43.640 --> 50:45.640
Are you just going to?

50:45.640 --> 50:47.640
Tomorrow morning it will be.

50:47.640 --> 50:49.640
I think you need to tease it.

50:49.640 --> 50:50.640
No, I'm wrong.

50:50.640 --> 50:51.640
I think it's fro-y.

50:51.640 --> 50:53.640
I think it's nervous.

50:53.640 --> 50:59.640
If you're not pressing it in a helmet shape in the morning,

50:59.640 --> 51:03.640
then what you have is hair that's been trained for 30 years

51:03.640 --> 51:06.640
to be ashamed of itself for living free.

51:06.640 --> 51:08.640
And so it's like trying to make, it's like, don't cut me.

51:08.640 --> 51:11.640
I can wear a helmet all day.

51:11.640 --> 51:12.640
Take it off.

51:12.640 --> 51:14.640
Hour later, this.

51:14.640 --> 51:17.640
Well, that's what I'm saying.

51:17.640 --> 51:20.640
It's like your hair, it looks kind of molded.

51:20.640 --> 51:22.640
Like a Play-Doh thing.

51:22.640 --> 51:26.640
It's not like Matt Stone.

51:26.640 --> 51:27.640
Right, yeah, yeah.

51:27.640 --> 51:29.640
Like, just like free.

51:29.640 --> 51:30.640
It's the same way every day.

51:30.640 --> 51:31.640
Like a poofy.

51:31.640 --> 51:33.640
This will look different tomorrow.

51:33.640 --> 51:35.640
It could be parted.

51:35.640 --> 51:36.640
You can see my scalp.

51:36.640 --> 51:38.640
Maybe you should let it keep going

51:38.640 --> 51:41.640
so it can get its spirit back.

51:41.640 --> 51:45.640
So it's not like Clark Kent with half a cape on.

51:45.640 --> 51:48.640
I see you just, you let it really just go

51:48.640 --> 51:51.640
and be like Leo Sayre or Gabe Kaplan.

51:51.640 --> 51:52.640
Yeah.

51:52.640 --> 51:53.640
Just big ass.

51:53.640 --> 51:55.640
Let it start dreading up.

51:55.640 --> 51:56.640
Yes.

51:56.640 --> 51:58.640
That's a Leo Sayre reference.

51:58.640 --> 51:59.640
Thank you, nobody.

51:59.640 --> 52:02.640
How does that, how did dreadlocks work?

52:02.640 --> 52:03.640
How do you get dreadlocks?

52:03.640 --> 52:04.640
I don't know.

52:04.640 --> 52:06.640
Is there a technique or is it just like a natural thing

52:06.640 --> 52:07.640
that happens?

52:07.640 --> 52:09.640
It's a technique.

52:09.640 --> 52:11.640
You put mud and stuff?

52:11.640 --> 52:14.640
I have a photo of me with dreadlocks in high school.

52:14.640 --> 52:17.640
I'm just a white dude with dreadlocks and it's not cool.

52:17.640 --> 52:18.640
Well, okay.

52:18.640 --> 52:19.640
So then you know how you get.

52:19.640 --> 52:20.640
How do you do it?

52:20.640 --> 52:23.640
Salt water, like I was like a body border

52:23.640 --> 52:25.640
and so just sand and salt and neglect.

52:25.640 --> 52:27.640
So it just happened naturally?

52:27.640 --> 52:29.640
Yeah, but also like my hair gets long.

52:29.640 --> 52:30.640
I have nervous energy.

52:30.640 --> 52:33.640
So I bite my nails, but also like I'm constantly

52:33.640 --> 52:34.640
twisting my hair when it gets long.

52:34.640 --> 52:35.640
Okay.

52:35.640 --> 52:37.640
So when it's got salt and sand in it,

52:37.640 --> 52:39.640
it just wants to kind of knot up a little, you know.

52:39.640 --> 52:40.640
Okay.

52:40.640 --> 52:42.640
But it's something you kind of halfway,

52:42.640 --> 52:44.640
you're sort of like, I think I'll do this now.

52:44.640 --> 52:46.640
Like you're like, I'm doing this anyway.

52:46.640 --> 52:47.640
And then you just did this a lot.

52:47.640 --> 52:48.640
Don't do it.

52:48.640 --> 52:50.640
I didn't say I was going to do it.

52:50.640 --> 52:52.640
I was just curious about how it works.

52:52.640 --> 52:53.640
Are we actually...

52:53.640 --> 52:54.640
No, Dan, do it.

52:54.640 --> 52:55.640
Get dreadlocks.

52:55.640 --> 52:59.640
What if that was your weird midlife crisis

52:59.640 --> 53:01.640
where you just said, fuck it.

53:01.640 --> 53:02.640
I got one dreadlocks.

53:02.640 --> 53:05.640
I probably got six months left for dreadlocks being possible.

53:05.640 --> 53:08.640
I guess that would be a practical thing to do.

53:08.640 --> 53:09.640
Also, your midlife crisis,

53:09.640 --> 53:12.640
what are you going to be, a fucking hundred?

53:12.640 --> 53:13.640
Yeah, exactly.

53:13.640 --> 53:14.640
Yeah.

53:14.640 --> 53:15.640
Okay.

53:15.640 --> 53:16.640
You could do it.

53:16.640 --> 53:18.640
Your midlife crisis choices have to start like right now.

53:18.640 --> 53:19.640
Yeah.

53:19.640 --> 53:20.640
Yeah.

53:20.640 --> 53:22.640
But dreadlocks would be fun for you.

53:22.640 --> 53:23.640
Yeah.

53:23.640 --> 53:25.640
You're in the pool all the time.

53:25.640 --> 53:27.640
You have a workout thing on your Instagram.

53:27.640 --> 53:29.640
Getting complicated relationship with my hair

53:29.640 --> 53:31.640
because it's going away.

53:31.640 --> 53:33.640
And I'm like, I never liked you.

53:33.640 --> 53:36.640
But like, come back.

53:36.640 --> 53:38.640
Wait, are you getting bald?

53:38.640 --> 53:40.640
Are you getting bald or just kind of gradually ceding?

53:40.640 --> 53:41.640
Oh, yeah.

53:41.640 --> 53:42.640
No, I'm definitely...

53:42.640 --> 53:43.640
That's all going away.

53:43.640 --> 53:44.640
Yeah.

53:44.640 --> 53:45.640
Do you have the male pattern thing on the back?

53:45.640 --> 53:46.640
Yeah.

53:46.640 --> 53:47.640
Yeah.

53:47.640 --> 53:48.640
But a beautiful beard.

53:48.640 --> 53:49.640
Thank you.

53:49.640 --> 53:50.640
Your beard is luscious.

53:50.640 --> 53:51.640
Yeah.

53:51.640 --> 53:54.640
It's like the rivers of the Orinoco.

53:54.640 --> 53:55.640
Yeah.

53:55.640 --> 53:57.640
Beards are just pubic hair in your face.

53:57.640 --> 54:00.640
I mean, it's not like, oh, he can grow a beard.

54:00.640 --> 54:02.640
Well, yeah, he's dying.

54:02.640 --> 54:03.640
You know?

54:03.640 --> 54:04.640
I can't grow a beard.

54:04.640 --> 54:05.640
I've never had a good beard.

54:05.640 --> 54:08.640
I have facial hair, but it's patchy.

54:08.640 --> 54:12.640
And like, I look like Johnny Depp on a bad weekend.

54:12.640 --> 54:14.640
Are we actually playing D&D?

54:14.640 --> 54:16.640
Yeah.

54:16.640 --> 54:18.640
Spencer, what you got?

54:18.640 --> 54:19.640
Do we have that song?

54:19.640 --> 54:20.640
We play it.

54:20.640 --> 54:22.640
Or it's not a song, but it is.

54:22.640 --> 54:24.640
You guys ready?

54:24.640 --> 54:26.640
Here we go.

54:26.640 --> 54:27.640
The town of...

54:27.640 --> 54:32.640
You found the town of Potos Donos, the farming village.

54:32.640 --> 54:33.640
There's about...

54:33.640 --> 54:34.640
It's not much of a farming village.

54:34.640 --> 54:38.640
There's like six farms, and there's only a handful of people.

54:38.640 --> 54:40.640
You haven't really met them.

54:40.640 --> 54:41.640
You just kind of...

54:41.640 --> 54:42.640
You rolled up on a farm.

54:42.640 --> 54:44.640
You killed a fucking ghost that was haunting the farm.

54:44.640 --> 54:47.640
And then you're like, well, I'm going to take this farm now.

54:47.640 --> 54:49.640
Potato basket!

54:49.640 --> 54:51.640
Does this seem kind of diminishing?

54:51.640 --> 54:54.640
Like we used to be fighters, and you had like ambitions.

54:54.640 --> 54:56.640
Look me in the eye and say that you're happy right now.

54:56.640 --> 54:58.640
I can't tell you that.

54:58.640 --> 55:01.640
There's one rival farmer, Kettemene.

55:01.640 --> 55:02.640
Kett...

55:02.640 --> 55:03.640
Alright.

55:03.640 --> 55:06.640
We should make friends with her and learn to farm better.

55:06.640 --> 55:07.640
We hear a knock at the door?

55:07.640 --> 55:08.640
Yeah.

55:08.640 --> 55:09.640
It's a raccoon man.

55:09.640 --> 55:10.640
Glad you're settling in.

55:10.640 --> 55:13.640
You do owe a lot of money for this property.

55:13.640 --> 55:14.640
I hear a fire.

55:14.640 --> 55:15.640
That tree is on fire.

55:15.640 --> 55:19.640
And arguing about that wraith is a woman who looks like a druid.

55:19.640 --> 55:22.640
And she's yelling at a small mole.

55:22.640 --> 55:25.640
I go, hey, what's the beef?

55:25.640 --> 55:27.640
You want to take care of this mole, get him off my back.

55:27.640 --> 55:29.640
Alright, well, I think I can settle this.

55:29.640 --> 55:30.640
This is our property.

55:30.640 --> 55:32.640
The mole's pissed and leaves.

55:32.640 --> 55:34.640
You know about the church of Korlax?

55:34.640 --> 55:35.640
I'm a worshipper.

55:35.640 --> 55:37.640
I want to, like, I'll do anything,

55:37.640 --> 55:39.640
other than just fucking grow a potato.

55:39.640 --> 55:45.640
Holding me,

55:45.640 --> 55:50.640
Schumers.

55:50.640 --> 55:52.640
Why do we become farmers?

55:52.640 --> 55:53.640
We should become musicians.

55:53.640 --> 55:55.640
I'm willing to give that a try.

55:55.640 --> 55:56.640
We'll go down to the town,

55:56.640 --> 55:59.640
and we'll see if there's any music.

55:59.640 --> 56:00.640
Jobs?

56:00.640 --> 56:01.640
That's a story.

56:01.640 --> 56:08.640
I'm so inspired.

56:08.640 --> 56:11.640
Baby Schumers.

56:11.640 --> 56:13.640
Baby Schumer.

56:13.640 --> 56:17.640
That didn't help me at all.

56:17.640 --> 56:21.640
I'm more confused than I was before that play.

56:21.640 --> 56:23.640
It jacked some memories for me.

56:23.640 --> 56:26.640
We were living on a potato farm.

56:26.640 --> 56:27.640
I had a stroke.

56:27.640 --> 56:32.640
We were about to go to town and see if there were any music jobs.

56:32.640 --> 56:33.640
Yeah.

56:33.640 --> 56:35.640
Now imagine what it would have been like to hear that

56:35.640 --> 56:38.640
like the week after you did those events, huh?

56:38.640 --> 56:40.640
Wouldn't that be crazy?

56:40.640 --> 56:42.640
Yeah, it would make me mad.

56:42.640 --> 56:45.640
Okay, I examine my surroundings.

56:45.640 --> 56:47.640
You're in the farmhouse,

56:47.640 --> 56:49.640
the farmhouse where you live.

56:49.640 --> 56:50.640
You were out farming.

56:50.640 --> 56:52.640
Oh boy, you didn't like it.

56:52.640 --> 56:54.640
You hated it, especially Jeff.

56:54.640 --> 56:56.640
Everyone else was kind of fine with it.

56:56.640 --> 57:00.640
Yeah, but I want to go get into adventures.

57:00.640 --> 57:02.640
Yeah.

57:02.640 --> 57:06.640
You guys talked about how you might want to just become a music band

57:06.640 --> 57:10.640
and try and do that for money.

57:10.640 --> 57:14.640
Do you guys want to become a music band for money?

57:14.640 --> 57:16.640
Like Troubadours?

57:16.640 --> 57:18.640
Are we near a town?

57:18.640 --> 57:19.640
You're in a town.

57:19.640 --> 57:21.640
You belong to a town.

57:21.640 --> 57:26.640
I walk into the local tavern that might host musical events.

57:26.640 --> 57:27.640
There's a local tavern.

57:27.640 --> 57:29.640
Okay, I go into that musical tavern.

57:29.640 --> 57:31.640
All right, you do that.

57:31.640 --> 57:34.640
Are you guys doing that too?

57:34.640 --> 57:38.640
I'm going to putter around the kitchen for a little bit.

57:38.640 --> 57:41.640
How much money do we have?

57:41.640 --> 57:43.640
Functionally none.

57:43.640 --> 57:46.640
Maybe like 200 gold or something.

57:46.640 --> 57:48.640
Are potatoes worth anything?

57:48.640 --> 57:49.640
You haven't sold them yet.

57:49.640 --> 57:51.640
The harvest isn't complete.

57:51.640 --> 57:52.640
You just started to get some.

57:52.640 --> 57:54.640
We've been eating them.

57:54.640 --> 57:56.640
They're too good not to.

57:56.640 --> 57:58.640
We're so good at it.

57:58.640 --> 58:00.640
What's the tavern called, Spencer?

58:00.640 --> 58:02.640
The Creaky Grieve.

58:02.640 --> 58:06.640
I go to the Creaky Grieve and I ask for the manager.

58:06.640 --> 58:08.640
You see the tavern keeper.

58:08.640 --> 58:11.640
His name's Cool Dennis.

58:11.640 --> 58:13.640
Oh, shit.

58:13.640 --> 58:15.640
It's coming back to me now.

58:15.640 --> 58:18.640
Yeah, you last saw him at a different tavern.

58:18.640 --> 58:20.640
Hey, Cool Dennis.

58:20.640 --> 58:23.640
My friends and I are working kind of a new musical act.

58:23.640 --> 58:27.640
You guys have like an open mic night or an open spot?

58:27.640 --> 58:28.640
Oh, yeah.

58:28.640 --> 58:30.640
We got this little stage up here.

58:30.640 --> 58:34.640
People can throw small denominations of coins at you.

58:34.640 --> 58:37.640
Okay, we're pretty thin on the coin

58:37.640 --> 58:39.640
so we could maybe use that money.

58:39.640 --> 58:40.640
What do you play?

58:40.640 --> 58:45.640
I play tambourine and so does everybody else.

58:45.640 --> 58:49.640
It's the first all tambourine trio.

58:57.640 --> 59:02.640
We only have one tambourine so we just pass.

59:02.640 --> 59:05.640
We pass around.

59:05.640 --> 59:07.640
It was sounding cool until that part.

59:07.640 --> 59:09.640
I was like, oh, that is kind of cool.

59:09.640 --> 59:12.640
But then it's like now it's a shared chamber.

59:12.640 --> 59:17.640
Yes, we're just slowly out of our luck wayward adventurers

59:17.640 --> 59:20.640
that are trying to farm potatoes.

59:20.640 --> 59:22.640
But we got the tambourine, but I got to tell you,

59:22.640 --> 59:26.640
it's the harmonies, which is the real show grabber.

59:26.640 --> 59:27.640
Sure.

59:27.640 --> 59:29.640
Well, I'm no talent scout.

59:29.640 --> 59:32.640
If you want to grab whatever instruments and come in tonight,

59:32.640 --> 59:34.640
that sounds like a thing you could do.

59:34.640 --> 59:36.640
Okay, go ahead.

59:36.640 --> 59:38.640
I'm at the house.

59:38.640 --> 59:39.640
What time is it?

59:39.640 --> 59:41.640
Let's say it's 11 a.m.

59:41.640 --> 59:45.640
The day after the events of the last episode we played.

59:45.640 --> 59:46.640
Okay.

59:46.640 --> 59:49.640
Is Diarrhea Jr. at the house?

59:49.640 --> 59:51.640
Yeah, unless he leaves.

59:51.640 --> 59:53.640
I'm still at the house.

59:53.640 --> 59:54.640
Diarrhea.

59:54.640 --> 59:55.640
Yes.

59:55.640 --> 59:59.640
Let's head out of town and meet up with Chad.

59:59.640 --> 01:00:02.640
I just want to lock down the farm,

01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:08.640
make sure we're not leaving any animals open.

01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:13.640
We should sew up those animals.

01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:14.640
All right.

01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:15.640
Well, you don't have to.

01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:18.640
I knew it farming.

01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:21.640
We did harvest that cow for meat.

01:00:21.640 --> 01:00:23.640
No, you did.

01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:24.640
We did it.

01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:27.640
I mean the pins and the barns and shits.

01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:28.640
Let's close it up.

01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:32.640
Yeah, just bumper crop of sarcasm.

01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:33.640
All right.

01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:35.640
I've shuttered the kitchen.

01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:38.640
Did you check the corral?

01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:40.640
Yeah, pin.

01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:41.640
Everyone's good.

01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:42.640
Everything's locked up.

01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:44.640
The potatoes are all tucked in.

01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:45.640
All right.

01:00:45.640 --> 01:00:47.640
Let's head down to the town.

01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:49.640
Let's head on down.

01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:51.640
Should we take horses?

01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:55.640
Yeah, I love horses.

01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:56.640
Do we own horses?

01:00:56.640 --> 01:00:58.640
I think you have one horse from the past.

01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:00.640
Why don't you take the horse?

01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:02.640
No, no, we could ride it together.

01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:03.640
Okay.

01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:04.640
I'm pretty light.

01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:05.640
All right.

01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:07.640
I'll get on the back.

01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:08.640
Okay.

01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:11.640
We get on the horse and we ride to town.

01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:13.640
You get on the horse.

01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:15.640
Oh, it doesn't like that.

01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:16.640
What?

01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:20.640
It starts bucking under your legs.

01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:23.640
Well, is it because there's two of us?

01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:27.640
It's because you rolled low.

01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:31.640
Oh, I'll get off.

01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:34.640
I'll get off too.

01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:35.640
We both get off.

01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:40.640
I start stroking the horse's head and I'm like, hey, man, it's us.

01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:42.640
Don't don't even don't even trip.

01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:43.640
We love you.

01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:44.640
We love where horse people.

01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:46.640
It's us, the people that sit on you all the time.

01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:47.640
Yeah.

01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:49.640
We're your friends.

01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:51.640
We're never going to go away.

01:01:51.640 --> 01:01:53.640
Don't pay attention to the low rolls.

01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:54.640
Think about those high rolls.

01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:56.640
We're going to sit on you for the rest of your life.

01:01:56.640 --> 01:01:58.640
We love we love you.

01:01:58.640 --> 01:01:59.640
Here's a carrot.

01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:00.640
Can I give it a carrot?

01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:03.640
Where did you get a carrot?

01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:04.640
Can I give it a potato?

01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:06.640
Yeah, you could give it a potato.

01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:08.640
I gave it a potato.

01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:09.640
All right.

01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:10.640
It loves it.

01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:11.640
It calms down dramatically.

01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:12.640
You like that potato?

01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:13.640
Yeah.

01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:14.640
Fucking like that potato.

01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:15.640
You like that?

01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:16.640
Yeah.

01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:17.640
You like that potato?

01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:18.640
Fucking horse.

01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:19.640
Piece of shit.

01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:22.640
Fucking thought I loved horses and then you just fucking turn on me.

01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:24.640
I hope you like that fucking potato.

01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:26.640
It's the last one you're going to fucking get.

01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:27.640
God damn.

01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:28.640
All right.

01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:29.640
Now we double mount that horse.

01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:30.640
Yeah.

01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:31.640
I would have.

01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:32.640
I'm going to face backwards.

01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:33.640
Yeah.

01:02:33.640 --> 01:02:34.640
Hell yeah.

01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:36.640
In case someone comes up on our six.

01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:37.640
Makes sense.

01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:38.640
Yeah.

01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:39.640
You get on the horse.

01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:40.640
Back to back.

01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:41.640
It's good.

01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:42.640
It's great.

01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:43.640
Oh.

01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:44.640
All right.

01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:45.640
We ride a town, baby.

01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:46.640
All right.

01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:47.640
You go to town.

01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:50.640
You see the tavern that Jeff walked into and you know he went in.

01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:52.640
You also see what's her name.

01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:53.640
Coggera.

01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:54.640
She was the elf.

01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:58.640
I guess she was an elf from the night before and she's like, hey, what's up?

01:02:58.640 --> 01:02:59.640
Hey, Coggera.

01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:02.640
That's a cool way to ride a horse.

01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:03.640
Yeah.

01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:06.640
Should we get some of the audience play Coggera?

01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:07.640
No.

01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:12.640
Should we get someone from the audience to play someone else?

01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:13.640
No.

01:03:13.640 --> 01:03:14.640
Go ahead.

01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:15.640
Yeah.

01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:16.640
I mean we can.

01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:17.640
I'm fine.

01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:20.640
I like the I like the area.

01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:21.640
You know.

01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:23.640
I like the dye area.

01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:27.640
It's Coggera, the girl that was fighting the the race.

01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:28.640
Yeah.

01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:30.640
With the thing in the yard.

01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:33.640
That was some real spooky stuff you had going on there.

01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:34.640
Oh, yeah.

01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:35.640
That's just, you know, my job.

01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:36.640
I'm a druid.

01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:37.640
We keep the balance.

01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:40.640
That thing was out of balance.

01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:41.640
Yeah.

01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:43.640
I used to adventure.

01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:44.640
Damn.

01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:48.640
Well, then I took an arrow in the knee.

01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:53.640
It's a little video game reference.

01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:56.640
What game is it a reference to oblivion?

01:03:56.640 --> 01:03:57.640
Oh, okay.

01:03:57.640 --> 01:03:58.640
Elder Scrolls.

01:03:58.640 --> 01:03:59.640
Two.

01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:00.640
Three.

01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:01.640
Four.

01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:02.640
Four.

01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:03.640
Oh.

01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:04.640
Hey guys.

01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:05.640
Hey.

01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:06.640
Hey.

01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:07.640
Oh.

01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:08.640
Oh, Dyeria and Carlos.

01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:09.640
Carlos.

01:04:09.640 --> 01:04:10.640
Which is not a Freaks and Geeks reference.

01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:11.640
Carlos.

01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:23.640
I got us a gig on Thursday nights playing some music for some for some coin.

01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:24.640
Oh, nice.

01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:25.640
Did they say they would pay?

01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:26.640
Or is it an open mic?

01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:27.640
Yeah.

01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:31.640
I guess the offering is that they would throw money at us.

01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:36.640
We get to keep whatever they throw on the table.

01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:43.880
I mean, to be quite honest, I kind of miss the adventuring and I kind of miss the swash

01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:45.880
buckling and the daring do.

01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:47.640
You guys play instruments?

01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:49.640
Who are you?

01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:50.640
Kagura.

01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:51.640
Oh, Kagura.

01:04:51.640 --> 01:04:52.640
I don't have a character.

01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:53.640
Yeah.

01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:54.640
We share a tambourine.

01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:55.640
We do.

01:04:55.640 --> 01:04:57.180
You should get your own instruments.

01:04:57.180 --> 01:04:59.640
Then you could like be masters of the craft.

01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:00.640
Bards.

01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:02.920
Do you know someone that has instruments?

01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:06.640
I know someone who can make wood into magical shapes.

01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:07.640
What?

01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:08.640
It's me.

01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:10.640
What?

01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:11.640
You're a bard?

01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:12.640
I'm a druid.

01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:13.640
I can, I can craft wood.

01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:17.640
I can, I can like tell this seedling to like turn into a fucking loot.

01:05:17.640 --> 01:05:18.640
Really?

01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:19.640
Oh yeah.

01:05:19.640 --> 01:05:20.640
Bullshit.

01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:24.000
I take a seedling.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:27.680
I find a seedling on the ground and I go turn this into a loot.

01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:29.400
Well, that won't work.

01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:30.800
What you just said that you could do that.

01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:31.800
I can do that.

01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:32.800
But what?

01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:33.800
I rolled.

01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:35.280
She's not easily manipulated.

01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:37.920
That's not the that's not the right kind of seedling.

01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:41.920
I can do it for you, but I don't just, you know, do my magic powers for free.

01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:42.920
What?

01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:43.920
What?

01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:44.920
We're kind of low on the dough right now.

01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:45.920
You can't turn potatoes into anything.

01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:46.920
Can you?

01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:51.920
I, oh, you want to believe what I could turn potatoes into.

01:05:51.920 --> 01:05:57.200
If you turn potatoes into a band's worth of instruments, one hundred percent of your overhead

01:05:57.200 --> 01:05:58.700
is covered.

01:05:58.700 --> 01:06:00.200
That's for sure.

01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:06.520
And plus we can pay you in potatoes on top of your expense DJ.

01:06:06.520 --> 01:06:10.400
Lay some potatoes on car and let's, let's, let's, let's get this course, but check out

01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:12.400
these potatoes.

01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:13.400
Whoa.

01:06:13.400 --> 01:06:15.400
Look at these.

01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:16.400
Yeah.

01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:17.400
Look at those.

01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:18.400
They're all knobbly.

01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:19.400
Okay.

01:06:19.400 --> 01:06:20.400
We're learning.

01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:22.000
We made them ourselves.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:23.000
Okay.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:24.000
What do you want these to be turned into?

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.400
I want a doghouse base.

01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:28.400
Okay.

01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:31.400
Is a loot.

01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:33.400
Okay.

01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:35.400
Uh, Ocarina.

01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:38.400
Now that, that I don't even need to use magic.

01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:39.400
What?

01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:40.600
You just know how to make them?

01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:41.600
Yeah.

01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:44.200
You just carve holes in a potato.

01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:45.400
That is what it is.

01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:46.600
A sweet potato.

01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:48.680
I like to think that I made my instruments.

01:06:48.680 --> 01:06:51.480
So yeah, yeah, potato, Ocarina.

01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:52.480
Let's do it.

01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:53.480
Okay.

01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:54.480
Potato.

01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:55.480
Ocarina.

01:06:55.480 --> 01:07:01.840
I, but you guys, you got to do me a favor first, you know, I don't just like do do spells

01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:02.840
for no one.

01:07:02.840 --> 01:07:03.840
Nope.

01:07:03.840 --> 01:07:04.840
What kind of favor are we talking?

01:07:04.840 --> 01:07:06.340
No quid pro quo.

01:07:06.340 --> 01:07:12.840
Well, as you know, as you may already know, I live in a tree, right, and the tree is recently

01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:18.600
besieged by monsters, what kind of monsters?

01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:19.600
Feral hogs.

01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:25.160
Oh, damn.

01:07:25.160 --> 01:07:28.480
But these are no ordinary feral hogs.

01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:32.360
They're extraordinary.

01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:33.520
In what way?

01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:38.640
They're harder to kill and they do crazy stuff that you wouldn't expect a feral hog to do.

01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:39.920
So what do you want us to do?

01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:40.920
Kill them.

01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:44.320
Are we carrying any of our weapons?

01:07:44.320 --> 01:07:48.560
No, those have been locked away in the closets of your farmhouse because you don't use them

01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:49.920
for farming.

01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:52.480
Can you turn potatoes into weapons?

01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:55.120
Yeah, I can.

01:07:55.120 --> 01:07:58.840
How much does that cost?

01:07:58.840 --> 01:08:02.840
If you use them primarily for the quest, I could do those.

01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:03.840
I could do those right now.

01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:10.120
I could do you for hand grenades, but what you could turn potatoes into hand grenades.

01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:11.120
Yeah.

01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:13.960
Do you ever bake a potato without poking holes in it?

01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:15.680
It's kind of like that.

01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:18.840
Do I still have my native druid fire abilities?

01:08:18.840 --> 01:08:24.200
Yeah, yeah, you have a produce flame and like a scorching beam.

01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:29.680
I take a potato and I use my fire to bake a potato.

01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:30.680
You do that.

01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:37.320
Oh boy, it looks so delicious and it only takes one hour.

01:08:37.320 --> 01:08:41.200
That's what magic does for you.

01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:43.960
Are you trying to prove that we don't need her?

01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:46.400
I mean, I'm just trying to be active.

01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:49.320
Wow, this guy can't keep it together.

01:08:49.320 --> 01:08:52.120
She's like, I can make you a potato hand grenade.

01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:53.120
Okay, okay, cool.

01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:54.120
I could bake a potato.

01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:58.880
It's like baking a potato and you're like, I'd take a potato and bake it, like you're

01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:00.840
all over the place.

01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:02.080
I just want to be...

01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:05.080
This guy needs to get his energy out on those boars.

01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:06.080
Yeah.

01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:09.920
Okay, well, this is what we got to do.

01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:10.920
Here we go.

01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:14.360
So, Kogara, what's her name?

01:09:14.360 --> 01:09:15.360
Kogara.

01:09:15.360 --> 01:09:18.160
Kogara, make us some potato grenades.

01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:19.160
All right.

01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:24.360
I'll come back in an hour for the one that I'm baking and then let's go out there and

01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:28.640
kick a little feral hog dick.

01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:34.680
All right, I'll meet you by the tree and here's a map I'm drawing on the dirt to show you

01:09:34.680 --> 01:09:35.920
where it is.

01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:40.160
Is our house on the way because we could, John Wick, pull a little bit, you know?

01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:41.160
Yeah, we could.

01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:44.360
Break open those cabinets, put on those outfits.

01:09:44.360 --> 01:09:46.960
Yeah, they're all buried in the floor.

01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:48.480
They mess with the wrong guy.

01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:49.960
How far away is our crib?

01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:51.160
It's pretty close.

01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:59.000
Okay, let's go strap up and get our weapons and we'll meet you back at the tree, Kogara,

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:03.040
and potato grenades and all, and we're going to have our own weapons ready to rock.

01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:04.040
That sounds good.

01:10:04.040 --> 01:10:05.040
Okay.

01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:06.040
Thanks for the map.

01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:07.040
Oh, yeah.

01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:10.960
It's more powerful than us, why couldn't she take care of her own hogs?

01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:13.360
Do you think she feels sorry for us?

01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:17.040
Is this like a thing like, like, like give a homeless guy a job?

01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:20.680
I think she's just lazy.

01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:24.160
You don't think she like sees us as self-esteem risks?

01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:30.200
Like, like, like, she's like, oh, jeez, these guys are, I think she sees us as disposable.

01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:35.760
Like why not just use hired labor to go out and do some dirty work?

01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:36.760
No.

01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:40.920
Well, let's show her what we're made of because we're not potato farmers.

01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:41.920
That was never us.

01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:42.920
We're potato musicians.

01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:45.760
Our heart was never in that.

01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:51.640
We're tambourine players, and now we're going to go show her what's the fucking real deal.

01:10:51.640 --> 01:10:54.000
We're going to, we're going to grab our weapons.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.120
Oh, am I keeping you up?

01:10:56.120 --> 01:11:03.920
Carlos, do you need a nap?

01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:04.920
It is true.

01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:13.680
We had to, we had a screening, the Rick and Morty offices, a real emotional depleter.

01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:15.920
I forgot my Adderall this morning.

01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:19.480
I'm really, really ready to take a nap.

01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:22.280
Daria, what's up with Carlos?

01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:23.280
He's fucking.

01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:24.280
He's fucking gibberish.

01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:25.280
He's fucking nonsense.

01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:27.280
What do you think he is?

01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:28.280
What's a Rick and Morty?

01:11:28.280 --> 01:11:30.360
Are they his old partners that he lost?

01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:31.360
Adderall?

01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:32.360
What?

01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:34.440
It might be his old flame.

01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:35.440
It could be.

01:11:35.440 --> 01:11:37.080
All right.

01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:43.560
We walk back to the Ghostbusters firehouse that is our potato farm.

01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:46.840
I forget what my primary weapon is, Spencer.

01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:47.840
Do you recall?

01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:49.520
I think you usually just shoot fire.

01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:50.520
Okay.

01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:53.520
Spencer, I punch holes in the floorboards with my fists.

01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:54.800
Holy shit.

01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:57.000
I can see your resolve.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.960
Someone's talking about a Baba Yaga somewhere.

01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:02.680
Man, I just watched John Wick 3.

01:12:02.680 --> 01:12:03.680
That movie was good.

01:12:03.680 --> 01:12:04.680
I liked it.

01:12:04.680 --> 01:12:05.680
I haven't seen it yet.

01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:06.680
My friend didn't like it, but I like it.

01:12:06.680 --> 01:12:08.240
I've never seen any John Wick's.

01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:09.240
The first one's good.

01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:10.240
The second one's less good.

01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:11.240
Third one's good.

01:12:11.240 --> 01:12:12.240
Third one's good.

01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:13.240
Really?

01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:14.240
What's the premise?

01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:15.240
What is a John Wick?

01:12:15.240 --> 01:12:16.240
What does it?

01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:17.240
What does he do?

01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:21.800
Well, he tries to get out, but they keep pulling him back in.

01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:26.080
The first one introduces you to the idea that there's a John Wick.

01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:31.360
And the second one is like, of course, there's lots of John Wick's and like John Wick has

01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:34.680
to, there's like hotels where you can stay if you're a John Wick.

01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:35.680
Is he a spy?

01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:36.680
Is he a super power?

01:12:36.680 --> 01:12:37.680
He's an assassin.

01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:44.400
There's a whole, it's just sort of like a, there's an eighth grade boy realm to the universe

01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:46.320
where everyone's an assassin.

01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:48.240
Your waiter's an assassin.

01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:50.240
The people he's waiting on are assassins.

01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:54.040
They only don't assassinate each other because no one's paying them to, and there's some

01:12:54.040 --> 01:12:58.160
code where you're staying at the Waldorf Astoria and you're not allowed to assassinate.

01:12:58.160 --> 01:13:03.200
John Wick does anyway, because he really wants someone dead and then El Swear Engine is like,

01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:05.120
do you realize what you've done?

01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:09.840
God damn it, if we do a John Wick three, you're going to fight the world.

01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:13.520
And then everyone in New York looks at him and they're all like assassins.

01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:19.600
And I swear to God, that's how John Wick 2 ends with John Wick, like El Swear Engine

01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:21.360
from Ian McShane.

01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:26.440
It goes, he goes, I'll give you a 10 second head start.

01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:32.120
And then John Wick starts walking and as the credits are going to start rolling, it's

01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:37.640
like this music is swelling as Keanu Reeves is walking past everyone in New York and there's

01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:42.640
like a guy in a cowboy hat with an eyepatch looking at him and talking into his cuff.

01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:46.800
And then there's like an old woman with a dog and the dog's eyes roll back and two guns

01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:47.800
come out.

01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:59.640
It's like this music is building like John Wick 3 is either never going to get shot or

01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:05.280
that movie is going to be fucking insane, because the second one was, I want to use

01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:14.040
the word retarded, but I honestly think retarded people will be like, that's fine.

01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:18.600
They'd be like, I don't because I don't know what other word like applies and my sister's

01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:19.600
retarded.

01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:27.640
So like and she I think if she saw John Wick, she'd be like, yeah, that's retarded.

01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:34.560
I really do because at one point he goes to a guy named the Somalia who you get your weapons

01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:35.560
from this guy.

01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:36.560
Somalia.

01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:43.560
Yeah, his his gimmick is he talks about weapons like he's a waiter like so he goes like would

01:14:43.560 --> 01:14:49.720
you like something like something to go with the fish, but he's like holding a gun.

01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:51.400
But here's the crazy thing.

01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:55.520
There's no one else around and there's nothing but guns everywhere, so there's no point in

01:14:55.520 --> 01:14:56.520
using a code.

01:14:56.520 --> 01:15:00.840
And then he says like guy you go to he just refer to everything was like he takes out a

01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:05.480
ego and how about some pineapple dessert and it's like a hand grenade and like why is he

01:15:05.480 --> 01:15:07.920
making this harder than it has to be.

01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:12.240
It goes both ways because he's like I'm going to need something for an after dinner jacket

01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:16.200
or something and then he pulls out a gun and he's like this is a clock p twenty two or

01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:17.200
whatever.

01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:22.560
It's like you said you say what type of gun this is and then you go back into weird like

01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:28.000
assassin creed and everybody pays each other with like these weird sand dollars from ancient

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:33.560
g g g like stonehenge that have needles in them and you like close them on your palms

01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:37.760
and you have got a little John Wick blood in a sundial and that means that you work

01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:41.760
for someone and these are good movies or I like the first.

01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:43.280
Did you like the first one?

01:15:43.280 --> 01:15:48.000
I like the I like the first one as much as everybody else did and I I honestly I watched

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:54.640
the second one by myself and I was like look at least this movie ain't lying to itself.

01:15:54.640 --> 01:15:56.160
Yeah, I watched the first one.

01:15:56.160 --> 01:16:01.240
I was like this is like maybe a perfect movie like this is so good and then the second one.

01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:04.840
I was like this is not what I wanted.

01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:09.520
I watched them back to back and I was going to be a lot of planes coming up and I should

01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:13.640
I watch number one and I'd say watch all of them and skip number two or do I just feel

01:16:13.640 --> 01:16:18.120
like I like I kind of like number two more than number why I feel like number one took

01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:22.720
itself a little too seriously given what all it was was just kind of shooting a million

01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:24.360
people in the head.

01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:30.680
And like this walking dead CG blood coming out and like I was like like the whole movie

01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:36.080
is just like they do them wrong in the beginning because they don't know he's John Wick and

01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:43.560
then like the only threshold is that the bad guy in the movie that's older says to his

01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:51.560
son you did what to who do you know who this guy is he's John Wick.

01:16:51.560 --> 01:17:03.080
We used to call him the wick you know why he's never lit but once he is no mosquitoes

01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:08.440
come around whatever but it's like his son's like I don't fucking care I'm uncockado care

01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:13.440
let him come and he's like you won't see him coming and then there's no conflict the rest

01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:17.160
of the movie is just counter he's going from fucking place to place it's like people are

01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:29.920
like hey that's far enough let me frisk you okay and then like the last guy of like a

01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:37.080
hundred guys in that warehouse it's like where is the next building full of people it's it's

01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:43.680
a block away it's it's a bathhouse it's a bathhouse and he's thanks shoots him in the

01:17:43.680 --> 01:17:49.240
head and then he cuts to like a Greek guy going like I'm telling you anyways to continue

01:17:49.240 --> 01:17:54.800
my conversation you don't know who this guy is and then it cuts to fucking bathhouse

01:17:54.800 --> 01:18:01.120
I swear that's the whole fucking movie so the whole movie is act to yes and then and

01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:06.440
then and then like the bad guy is just like his dad yelled at him enough where he gets

01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:10.040
it that's the other thing is like he's not like walking Phoenix and gladiator where

01:18:10.040 --> 01:18:14.520
he's like fuck you old man I'll deal with you know like I'm he's like the guy the kid

01:18:14.520 --> 01:18:18.960
is like okay it sounds like I fucked up also the dad's like really hard to kill and he's

01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:22.960
gonna come kill me and so the kid just like sits in a fucking ninth warehouse and he's

01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:28.080
just like there waiting what what are the stakes like how do you take John Wick down

01:18:28.080 --> 01:18:33.680
or you just don't you don't obviously don't shoot you in the head and yeah he just shoots

01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:38.120
everyone in the head and then John Wick just that's why I like John Wick to a little better

01:18:38.120 --> 01:18:43.760
because at least it's like the movie seems to agree a little bit more that everything

01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:49.080
is like as I said although I won't keep using the word it starts with an R but like it it

01:18:49.080 --> 01:18:53.640
just seemed like the movie and you are in the same page for John Wick to where it's

01:18:53.640 --> 01:19:02.200
like yeah it beats government work right I watching the movie yeah what if I'm on a

01:19:02.200 --> 01:19:06.920
plane and I want to just start with number three is that a bad idea I think it's a great

01:19:06.920 --> 01:19:12.960
idea I mean you could do it but I think it's yeah I don't know what he does a lot of stuff

01:19:12.960 --> 01:19:18.000
that doesn't quite make sense if you don't know what's happening I I asked the writer's

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:26.440
assistant and Rick and Morty when a couple months ago he said I saw John Wick 3 I said

01:19:26.440 --> 01:19:32.200
so they do they make good on the promises of John Wick 2 or this is like the whole world's

01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:39.800
an assassin and he's like yeah I don't know who makes their food which is what I wanted

01:19:39.800 --> 01:19:46.200
to hear you can't get an Uber like it's just everyone's yeah oh you can get an Uber but

01:19:46.200 --> 01:20:01.600
it'll be the Uber mmm I make a five stars well I recommend you drop me off before my

01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:12.880
destination oh clever what was the story and stop me if I told it before about the Peter

01:20:12.880 --> 01:20:17.480
O'Toole's being interviewed and he didn't have done a film with Keanu Reeves and and

01:20:17.480 --> 01:20:21.680
someone it's the interviewer said like what was it like working with them and he goes

01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:29.440
well can you and and the interviewer says it's Keanu and he goes yes but one gets the

01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:50.920
idea I don't care how you say it Peter O'Toole one gets the idea I mean that's so awesomely

01:20:50.920 --> 01:21:02.800
dismissive all right so are we back at the farm I mean can we retrieve our weapons now

01:21:02.800 --> 01:21:06.840
we're back at the crib right yeah oh wait I punch him you punch open the floor board

01:21:06.840 --> 01:21:11.000
the floor his weapons can we do the gag where he's punched he punches through the floor and

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:14.960
it's like all the music's mounting and then in the background of the shot I'm opening

01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:21.280
a cabinet and that's all and then I hand him his stuff well then what's in the floorboards

01:21:21.280 --> 01:21:28.240
right that's the joke no I know what is oh it's my it's my so church of the silver flame

01:21:28.240 --> 01:21:35.480
chain mail oh well yeah okay well then that's great yeah yeah don't I don't I have like

01:21:35.480 --> 01:21:40.960
a staff like a like a chilele kind of yeah I think you got a chilele yeah and that cast

01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:47.800
magical Donna chilele I just get that and whatever my knapsack holds in terms of you

01:21:47.800 --> 01:21:52.520
know food and tools and whatnot yep you get those you might have a knife too but yeah

01:21:52.520 --> 01:21:56.560
you usually just shoot fire I think I guess the joke one version of the joke I'm not really

01:21:56.560 --> 01:22:01.520
a joke writer but really he's paint he punches through the floor he's just there's always

01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:04.360
punching through the floor the music suggests that there's gonna be something under there

01:22:04.360 --> 01:22:09.000
and then I and I open a cabinet and I hand him a bundle of his stuff and he looks at

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:15.840
it and he's like I thought I thought you were gonna put it into the floorboards and I'm

01:22:15.840 --> 01:22:26.920
like why why would I do that like like what a horrible way his his his another another

01:22:26.920 --> 01:22:31.080
pitch well like while he's punching holes in the floor and you not you Carlos and I don't

01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:35.840
understand why he's doing that we get our weapons out and including his right that we

01:22:35.840 --> 01:22:40.680
keep in our weapon cabinet right yeah and and then we walk over to him and we hand him

01:22:40.680 --> 01:22:47.640
wood and tools to repair the floor that he broke for no reason yeah what if what if that's

01:22:47.640 --> 01:22:51.360
what we'll come out of our security what if that's what that's what he pulls like hammers

01:22:51.360 --> 01:23:00.000
and nails in all these places he puts them back that's way better than what he reaches

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:07.000
in and pulls out wait he goes okay here's here's here it is there's a little lateral

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:12.600
but like he he he punches through the floorboards and then so far it's been so straightforward

01:23:12.600 --> 01:23:17.520
while he's doing it like I open up the cabinet and I pull out like three bundles of stuff

01:23:17.520 --> 01:23:21.480
and the third bundle I put in front of him and he's like he's just finished like punching

01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:27.600
through the took a while to break through and as he finishes I put the his stuff in front

01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:32.240
of him he goes what's that I go it's your stuff and he goes what's down here and he

01:23:32.240 --> 01:23:39.880
reaches down and pulls up floorboards lumber and nails yeah okay you fucking stuff that

01:23:39.880 --> 01:23:44.440
you're gonna use to fix the floor yeah okay I think I think we got that joke locked down

01:23:44.440 --> 01:23:53.160
this one what do you what do you guys think I think you saved the picture this one's way

01:23:53.160 --> 01:23:58.560
worse but just to say it like he opens up he opens up the floor and he pulls out a box

01:23:58.560 --> 01:24:01.960
and there's all these like golden assassin coins in it and then you you put down the

01:24:01.960 --> 01:24:05.760
weapons and then Steve like puts the coin in like a quarter machine and bubble gum comes

01:24:05.760 --> 01:24:10.720
out and he just choose it and it's like he was just doing that he was just trying to

01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:18.920
get some gum I said it was worse but I think it's better than yours or like he punches

01:24:18.920 --> 01:24:26.560
the floor and then what he pulls out is a book that says like dealing with stress anger

01:24:26.560 --> 01:24:34.560
management stupid wait don't don't wrap your hands don't we have a cowster killer what

01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:39.800
are we doing yeah pigs pigs hogs like I he punches through the floor and then he pulls

01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:48.840
out of he he he pulls out a book that says anger management and he goes like and we pull

01:24:48.840 --> 01:25:00.640
out a book from the cabinet that says carpentry and we're like but also down there there's

01:25:00.640 --> 01:25:06.480
a book that says how to kill feral hugs oh yeah that we didn't know was there we go okay

01:25:06.480 --> 01:25:12.600
let's read that on our way back to the village and kill kill some feral hogs we're not going

situation if you get disarmed you won't have something in your pocket you use as a weapon

01:26:22.400 --> 01:26:26.640
you never know when you have to home alone exactly I might I might have to Macaulay Culkin

01:32:27.200 --> 01:32:32.080
are dead but wave to I don't do the wave to is coming yeah you see three pigs coming

01:32:32.080 --> 01:32:37.960
these are twice the size of the last pig fireball all right I don't think you have proper fire

01:32:37.960 --> 01:32:44.120
ball okay well fire I throw I throw some fires oh you throw them this is a craziest dice app

01:32:44.120 --> 01:32:56.840
I've ever had all right you hit both of them yeah and you do 14 damage yeah are they in

01:32:56.840 --> 01:33:04.840
a mobile pork units they are mobile park are they on fire no they just their tough skin

01:33:04.840 --> 01:33:08.640
gets charred and it smells like bacon actually they each take seven damage because you hit

01:33:08.640 --> 01:33:15.240
one fire at each of them and one of them doesn't get hit but then the pigs they kind of rear

01:33:15.240 --> 01:33:20.640
up on two legs and you can see in their stomach there's a giant toothy ma and then they kind

01:33:20.640 --> 01:33:26.880
of bend over backwards all weird horror style so the ma is like up like like a snapping

01:33:26.880 --> 01:33:37.160
mouth and they're kind of like twisted backwards like body horror shit we got fucking 1985

01:33:37.160 --> 01:33:45.320
the thing pigs you're up Carlos we just do your best Cronenberg cows turn pigs pigs

01:33:45.320 --> 01:33:51.800
yeah that's not a thing yeah okay so how many we looking at right now three three three

01:33:51.800 --> 01:33:57.240
horror pigs three or extraordinary what's the distance what's the range that were between

01:33:57.240 --> 01:34:05.600
us oh they're close now they're 15 feet all right I cast a righteous circle around my

01:34:05.600 --> 01:34:14.880
compatriots buffing their combat skills and increasing their confidence all right you

01:34:14.880 --> 01:34:20.200
you consecrate the area for our listeners who didn't see that Dan just put his glasses

01:34:20.200 --> 01:34:28.160
on while he said that in a very nonchalant kind of groovy professorial way that happens

01:34:28.160 --> 01:34:35.920
the pigs attack they god fuck they miss they all miss why are you mad why are you on their

01:34:35.920 --> 01:34:42.160
side it's just sad when nothing happens you know they bite at you with their big jaws

01:34:42.160 --> 01:34:47.320
but I guess even though this is potentially their true form they're not really agile and

01:34:47.320 --> 01:34:52.720
you find it easy to dodge out of their snapping mouths damn Carlos I'm feeling so confident

01:34:52.720 --> 01:35:02.400
right now I'm feeling really really hot I'm some hot diarrhea right now so hot I pull

01:35:02.400 --> 01:35:08.200
out of another potato grenade I unpun it and I attempt to throw it directly into the underbelly

01:35:08.200 --> 01:35:16.680
mouth all right just full of confidence oh boy you miss you hit behind them and they only

01:35:16.680 --> 01:35:24.920
take half damage which is six okay whose turn is it right it could be your turn okay I take

01:35:24.920 --> 01:35:31.280
up my chilele and I shoot a fire bolt at one of the pigs all right which one the one that

01:35:31.280 --> 01:35:42.840
has more damage or less I think the strongest one all right you missed this fucking thing

01:35:42.840 --> 01:35:51.520
you start a fire is it in the field no it's in the it's in the it's on a shrubbery next

01:35:51.520 --> 01:36:06.720
to the end of the clearing cause light wounds oh yeah they each get scraped do harm you

01:36:06.720 --> 01:36:15.440
do do harm you do eight damage to one of the pigs yeah oh boy it fray it shrivels is

01:36:15.440 --> 01:36:20.760
that this one is one of the three so we got two up oh yeah it's exciting one down all

01:36:20.760 --> 01:36:30.360
right did someone order a dead pig I did good here's your order

01:36:30.360 --> 01:36:45.640
whose turn is it I think Steve maybe do we get another round yeah we're in combat baby

01:36:45.640 --> 01:37:03.120
are all right I pull out my sword and I swing it yeah yeah I'm so confident I'm gonna you

01:37:03.120 --> 01:37:08.200
see you seem extra confident right now yeah actually you know before I do this I rip off

01:37:08.200 --> 01:37:14.800
my shirt take my sword out and my shield and I do that special sword shield attack you know

01:37:14.800 --> 01:37:20.720
what's special about it I don't know is on my character sheet okay you do it you hit

01:37:20.720 --> 01:37:27.640
it with your sword and then your shield the sword hits the shield doesn't do damage because

01:37:27.640 --> 01:37:32.760
it's like a shield you smack it but it doesn't seem very bothered by it but your sword hits

01:37:32.760 --> 01:37:41.200
the other one for three three six damage three six no six six damage it takes six damage

01:37:41.200 --> 01:37:47.960
and it's fine it's like I love this my turn no it's the pigs turn it's like an Adams family

01:37:47.960 --> 01:37:56.520
pig he likes loves getting hit with a shield all right the pig attacks Steve and it bites

01:37:56.520 --> 01:38:02.920
you with its eldritch mouth oh no dealing 16 damage are you done you might be dying I

01:40:53.120 --> 01:41:00.240
the giant fifteen foot armor plated crab pig in front of us I'm feeling it mission accomplished

01:41:00.240 --> 01:41:05.440

01:41:21.240 --> 01:41:28.600
okay no way man I think so we're playing for life I think simulation theories like compelling

01:41:28.600 --> 01:41:33.240
evidence that like religions are still possible like you could still be all like ah you know

01:41:33.240 --> 01:41:37.680
what's happening there's everyone's hands everyone's actually hands and that's my religious

01:41:37.680 --> 01:41:48.760
belief and people feel like maybe that sounds great fireballs you hit you hit the underside

01:41:48.760 --> 01:41:54.720
of it you hit like you you hit the gas canister on the underside of it and it blows up like
