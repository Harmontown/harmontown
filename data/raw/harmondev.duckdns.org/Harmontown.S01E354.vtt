It's pretty hot\n\n07:16.960 --> 07:22.640\nBut I think I could take like I think what I can do is I can go I can take like a mead spiral notebook cover\n\n07:23.280 --> 07:26.960\nI put it over like I don't know I could make my own custom case\n\n07:27.520 --> 07:32.480\nSo that it just looks like a guy why does have to be right here neck because I need to as quickly as possible\n\n07:32.480 --> 07:37.520\nPerhaps while in the middle of a conversation, but you ain't got time to reach into that pocket\n\n07:38.160 --> 07:44.400\nNo, you want it to be right right by your sternum in your sifoid process. Yeah, that's correct. Did you want the answer to your question?\n\n07:44.560 --> 07:45.680\nYes\n\n07:45.680 --> 07:52.000\nYeah, because that is correct. It's a matter of milliseconds. Like it's a matter of like hey, jeff take a quick note with your\n\n07:52.480 --> 07:55.200\niPhone. I want you to make a quick note of something about what?\n\n07:56.000 --> 07:58.160\nOh, don't forget, uh, I have Dr.\n\n07:58.160 --> 08:03.520\nJavago's showing at the arc light Tuesday while you asked me I reached in my pocket and pulled out\n\n08:03.920 --> 08:06.960\nWell, yeah, don't forget to turn it on don't forget to find the fucking app\n\n08:06.960 --> 08:12.880\nDon't forget to thumb javago in after the after the seven autocorrects where it says do you mean zimbabwe?\n\n08:13.360 --> 08:15.840\nLike oh and the entire time you're doing it\n\n08:15.840 --> 08:21.280\nI think you're a tool because it looks like you're tweeting or texting. What was your question about dr. Javago?\n\n08:21.280 --> 08:24.800\nI didn't have fucking questions. You did and then you interrupted the fucking answer\n\n08:24.800 --> 08:26.800\nThere\n\n08:26.800 --> 08:32.560\nI want to be able to eliminate the barriers the answer is taster neck between my thoughts and\n\n08:34.320 --> 08:36.320\nContaining david lee\n\n08:37.040 --> 08:43.120\nSo you pull this out.

No, I mean I agree 100% with that\n\n09:05.760 --> 09:08.480\nThat's the reason I used to carry like a moleskin, you know\n\n09:08.640 --> 09:13.360\nThe s-pen was not fast enough for me. So I super glued a little nipple to it\n\n09:14.320 --> 09:19.280\nWhat does that do it makes it faster to because I like push you push on the s-pen\n\n09:19.280 --> 09:22.400\nIt's like flush with the bottom and then you gotta like dig it out with your thumbnails\n\n09:22.480 --> 09:25.760\nLike what's the point of that? I click so I super glue a little nipple to it\n\n09:26.880 --> 09:31.680\nThe cool thing about the galaxy note 10 plus. I don't know if like galaxy note 10 9 plus\n\n09:32.400 --> 09:33.840\nHad this already but\n\n09:33.840 --> 09:38.960\nI'm pleased with the technology now because they've finally managed with a thousand dollars of electronics to actually\n\n09:39.200 --> 09:43.200\nSurpass a regular notebook because you don't have to turn a page\n\n09:43.440 --> 09:44.800\nBut you can do everything else\n\n09:44.800 --> 09:51.280\nYou pick it up. You take the fucking pen out as soon as you do it goes into a mode that you can write any kind of\n\n09:51.280 --> 09:54.160\nFucking aids shit, whatever. No, it's whatever\n\n09:55.200 --> 09:59.200\nAnd and then you can give your phone. I didn't have to do anything\n\n09:59.200 --> 10:04.400\nBut take the pen out as with a regular thing and then when I put it back in it saves it goes back to sleep\n\n10:04.560 --> 10:06.560\nBoom, bam\n\n10:06.560 --> 10:14.240\nHell yeah, congratulations samsung you've beaten the fucking 1950s notebook\n\n10:14.720 --> 10:20.400\nFinally god damn it with this technology.

Let's say that you\n\n31:04.400 --> 31:10.480\nCould cure leukemia if you dangled five pounds of weight off your cock\n\n31:11.360 --> 31:16.000\nFor 15 seconds. I'd do that. I'm not letting you this is a gotcha question\n\n31:18.720 --> 31:21.920\nYou you'd rather let people die of leukemia. There's children out there day\n\n31:21.920 --> 31:27.360\nI didn't say that I didn't say that and your dick is so precious to you that you couldn't dangle five pounds of weight off of it\n\n31:27.680 --> 31:33.360\nI don't I don't I'm not buying into your scenario. I think leukemia is caused by disingenuous friendships\n\n31:33.360 --> 31:35.360\nOh\n\n31:35.680 --> 31:37.680\nAll right, uh\n\n31:38.240 --> 31:40.800\nI'd like to bring up our first guest. Timmy. Uh, no\n\n31:44.080 --> 31:46.080\nHe could have made it today\n\n31:49.600 --> 31:52.960\nEither because I refused to mutilate myself or because Jeff\n\n31:55.760 --> 32:02.000\nUm, yeah, well moving right along got a lot of show to get through here tonight. So let's keep it moving\n\n32:02.000 --> 32:07.600\nUh, Jeff, what does your envelope say so far? It says well, it's not a whole lot\n\n32:08.640 --> 32:10.640\nIt says memory sprite and father\n\n32:11.680 --> 32:15.360\nDangle weights from his penis. Hey, you wrote that down. I\n\n32:16.400 --> 32:22.080\nI usually write just things down you just write him down and you but then did you write it down before you set it?\n\n32:22.400 --> 32:25.760\nNo, I write it down and think later on if it's a callback\n\n32:26.320 --> 32:30.960\nLike I can look at the thing but right now I'm too dazzled by the fact there's butterflies everywhere\n\n32:30.960 --> 32:35.040\nAnd so normally I have a lot more notes than than just those two things\n\n32:35.920 --> 32:38.080\nDid you you guys know about the feral hog?\n\n32:39.760 --> 32:45.520\nI gotta shoot like the guy that had to shoot he had to murder 30 to 50 feral hogs in the space of five minutes or something\n\n32:45.600 --> 32:47.760\nWell, anybody listen to that podcast reply all\n\n32:48.800 --> 32:53.680\nYeah, that's kind of fun. What happened? Uh, well, there was this kind of I don't know if you call it a meme\n\n32:53.760 --> 32:56.240\nThere was like a trope a thing a phenomenon\n\n32:56.240 --> 33:01.040\nOn online where like there was some there was some assault rifle talk going on on twitter\n\n33:01.040 --> 33:04.560\nAnd then there was a guy no one needs an assault rifle. Who needs an assault rifle?\n\n33:04.720 --> 33:07.600\nAnd then someone's tweeted and said a question for\n\n33:08.400 --> 33:10.080\nrural\n\n33:10.080 --> 33:12.000\nAmerica\n\n33:12.000 --> 33:16.000\nHow do I deal with the 30 to 50 feral hogs that run into my yard?\n\n33:16.000 --> 33:20.640\nWell, my two to three children are playing every 10 minutes or whatever the fuck something really specific\n\n33:20.640 --> 33:22.960\nAnd everybody was like having a gas with it because it was kind of silly\n\n33:22.960 --> 33:26.560\nIt just seemed like a guy that was just making up a reason why you wouldn't need an assault rifle\n\n33:27.520 --> 33:34.480\nAnd he was but but but then the reply all podcast, which is which is really great. It's a great podcast like\n\n33:36.080 --> 33:40.960\nIt as it as it always does like it just went down the rabbit hole of that story first\n\n33:41.600 --> 33:48.800\nContacting that guy who as always on reply all turns out to be a wonderful human being who's like totally gets why it's funny\n\n33:48.800 --> 33:54.800\nHe's like it's like he's like do you understand why everyone like was like retweeting it Megan was like, yeah\n\n33:54.800 --> 34:00.160\nNo, it's a it's a it's a ridiculous tweet like I was I was like what's ridiculous to you about it's like\n\n34:00.160 --> 34:03.520\nWell, it's just the first of all 30 to 50 is a weird number\n\n34:04.320 --> 34:09.360\nLike he ran down the whole thing. It was like they but but also the guy was like, you know\n\n34:09.360 --> 34:16.000\nIt's like oh shit this feral hog thing is a real thing and he did have that experience basically he didn't have an assault rifle\n\n34:16.640 --> 34:17.760\num\n\n34:17.760 --> 34:23.360\nBut he was just sort of like in the moment. He was like from his own life experience is like saying\n\n34:23.600 --> 34:25.600\nHere's a reason you'd need an assault rifle\n\n34:26.640 --> 34:32.320\nAnd and then and then so then the episode continues to just go into this whole feral hog thing which is fucking\n\n34:32.880 --> 34:34.480\nfascinating\n\n34:34.480 --> 34:41.040\nSo the spaniards when they came when they when they were conquist adoring or whatever like they would they would like\n\n34:41.600 --> 34:43.600\nConquering is that problematic\n\n34:43.600 --> 34:49.680\nUm, they would I guess it was like a a medieval thing to like you would bring pigs with you\n\n34:50.000 --> 34:52.000\nAnd this is already cool like\n\n34:52.640 --> 34:54.640\nLike like this is such this is such weird like\n\n34:55.200 --> 34:59.440\nMinecrafty kind of like what was it modern-ish kind of thinking like the\n\n35:00.240 --> 35:05.440\nguys who were in the business of of like colonial imperialistic just like fucking world\n\n35:06.080 --> 35:08.080\nPaving like they would just bring\n\n35:08.080 --> 35:17.440\nHogs with them because they fuck like rabbits and they're they turn everything they eat into bacon which you and and so they\n\n35:17.760 --> 35:20.480\nYou just take a couple pigs with you when you get on a ship\n\n35:20.880 --> 35:25.440\nAnd wherever you land if there's a forest you kick their little asses out of the boat\n\n35:25.600 --> 35:31.200\nYou know, they're gonna go fuck and like raise like the pigs are like the fastest reproducing\n\n35:32.080 --> 35:35.600\nmammals or something like that which I find astonishing and uh\n\n35:35.600 --> 35:38.720\nAnd the way they describe it is like they basically do all the foraging\n\n35:38.720 --> 35:46.000\nYou would otherwise have to do and they turn every acorn leaf insect. They turn it all into one big mobile fucking pork unit\n\n35:46.560 --> 35:49.360\nUm, and and and and they wouldn't um\n\n35:50.160 --> 35:52.160\nThey wouldn't build pens\n\n35:52.880 --> 35:54.880\nmobile\n\n35:57.040 --> 35:58.560\nJeff's writing it down\n\n35:58.560 --> 36:03.200\nI want to see the day when that comes in handy when somebody like stumbles up to you on a sidewalk\n\n36:03.200 --> 36:07.120\nGoes like what did he say about that and you're like this is mobile pork unit\n\n36:08.080 --> 36:12.400\nUm, he's getting a little little little creased up envelope in your in your in your pocket\n\n36:12.560 --> 36:19.200\nBut but I just think that's fascinating because particularly it's um, it's not what we associate with like agrarian society\n\n36:19.280 --> 36:22.560\nIt was like they would let the pigs they wanted them to flourish\n\n36:22.640 --> 36:27.280\nRight, so it was like it was a sort of like you let the pigs out into the wild\n\n36:27.680 --> 36:32.000\nAnd then you start conquist adoring knowing that wherever you go\n\n36:32.000 --> 36:36.480\nAs you're looking for your fountains of youth or whatever the fuck you're doing like that\n\n36:36.720 --> 36:43.120\nYou've now seeded this land with these mobile fucking pork units. You're just gonna run across them\n\n36:43.120 --> 36:47.040\nThey're easy to hunt. They've they've turned everything into port and you just go\n\n36:47.680 --> 36:52.240\nAnd you and you just eat it and then you keep moving. I I just find like so like\n\n36:52.960 --> 36:54.080\nLike\n\n36:54.080 --> 37:00.000\nDisgustingly human like it's such a beautiful thing and now we're suffering for it like all these centuries later these are\n\n37:00.000 --> 37:04.240\nThere's there's like there was a sort of like dormant pig population\n\n37:04.720 --> 37:08.640\nUm, and here's the craziest most ironic thing about it\n\n37:09.040 --> 37:13.520\nSo so that when the feral pig problem suddenly starts to blossom in the united states\n\n37:13.920 --> 37:18.240\nThe first instinct given our lessons we've learned from the passenger pigeon and thing you just go\n\n37:18.400 --> 37:26.640\nThis is easy. We know what to do open season on feral pigs have added america and uh, a little problem there like, uh\n\n37:26.640 --> 37:29.840\nUh, cunts are also killing pigs is like\n\n37:31.840 --> 37:35.680\nIt's if you're if you're down for killing like it is the\n\n37:36.400 --> 37:39.520\nOpen season on pigs is like way cooler than open season on pigeons\n\n37:39.840 --> 37:45.600\nLike like you get to now take quarter sticks of dynamite and create booby traps where pigs are flying in the air\n\n37:45.920 --> 37:49.360\nYou you get to pop in a helicopter and have a headset and just go\n\n37:49.360 --> 37:56.320\nBrrrrrrrrrr. Um, like they fuck so fast. They're ready to fuck again in six months after they're born\n\n37:56.880 --> 38:01.200\nUm, and they're like the but here's the crazy irony to it\n\n38:01.920 --> 38:09.280\nThe reason they're spreading out of control is because it's legal to hunt them and it's fun to hunt them for some people\n\n38:09.440 --> 38:14.320\nlike tourists and things like there's a thriving business and industry\n\n38:14.800 --> 38:17.120\nit's kind of like the poaching thing where it's like\n\n38:17.120 --> 38:22.680\nThere are people in the world who never want these things to go extinct because they now\n\n38:22.680 --> 38:31.200\nhave a way to make lots of money, i.e. charging tickets to bring you along to fuck up pigs\n\n38:31.200 --> 38:33.200\nand your weird jigsaw, sociopathic tendencies.\n\n38:33.200 --> 38:40.080\nI know a couple chefs that they pay to go out and hunt wild boar so they can get boar\n\n38:40.080 --> 38:42.920\nbacon and render boar fat.\n\n38:42.920 --> 38:50.960\nThere are farmers out there whose videos are almost indistinguishable from the horrible\n\n38:50.960 --> 38:56.200\nkind of guys who are laughing with glee as they're blowing up these pigs, but the difference\n\n38:56.200 --> 39:01.800\nis there are farmers out there who wish they were just all gone and who are not enjoying\n\n39:01.800 --> 39:07.120\nkilling thousands of them a week going out four nights a week at three in the morning\n\n39:07.120 --> 39:12.360\non three wheelers with assault rifles going on and just night vision and apparently these\n\n39:12.360 --> 39:15.600\nthings are so smart you can't trap them the same way twice.\n\n39:15.600 --> 39:21.960\nIf you trap a pig and another pig sees it, no other pig is ever going to fall for that\n\n39:21.960 --> 39:22.960\ntrap.\n\n39:22.960 --> 39:30.800\nIt sounds like a joke, but it's like if they build a house out of straw, another one's\n\n39:30.800 --> 39:34.800\ngot one made out of brick the next day, it's crazy.\n\n39:34.800 --> 39:38.720\nThey tried introducing wolves into the wild and now we just got homeless pigs, that's\n\n39:38.720 --> 39:39.720\nit.\n\n39:39.720 --> 39:44.520\nYou have a bunch of dudes with guns running around killing pigs, but they're breeding\n\n39:44.520 --> 39:45.520\nfaster.\n\n39:45.520 --> 39:53.320\nWell, also, these guys, but it's like that's the super irony to me is like they, like the\n\n39:53.320 --> 39:58.600\nguy in Jurassic Park 3, it's like they abscond with fucking pigs, like they breed them and\n\n39:58.600 --> 40:00.840\nthey spread them.\n\n40:00.840 --> 40:07.200\nBecause they're bread and butter, pork is their bread and butter.\n\n40:07.200 --> 40:12.080\nHere's something crazy, here's how huge the problem is Jeff.\n\n40:12.080 --> 40:21.640\nPETA and the national feral hog genocide enthusiasts, I don't know what they're called, like the\n\n40:21.640 --> 40:28.920\nAmerican Farmers Association who are suffering the brunt of this infestation, PETA and those\n\n40:28.920 --> 40:31.720\nguys are arm in arm.\n\n40:31.720 --> 40:40.840\nJust because even PETA is like, this madness has to stop and it has to stop in the most\n\n40:40.840 --> 40:43.280\nhumane way possible.\n\n40:43.280 --> 40:47.440\nThey lobby together, that's how fucked up the situation is.\n\n40:47.440 --> 40:53.040\nAnd there are people that are like, let's poison them all, but to poison a thing that\n\n40:53.040 --> 40:57.680\nis like the size of a human means, what are you going to use?\n\n40:57.680 --> 40:59.880\nHow much rat poison are you going to put?\n\n40:59.880 --> 41:02.080\nAnd then it's like this crazy thing.\n\n41:02.080 --> 41:05.120\nAnd that's actually the point we've gotten to, that's the end of the story is that actually\n\n41:05.120 --> 41:10.480\neven the people that are environmentalists who are like, if you poison these pig population\n\n41:10.480 --> 41:16.640\nenough to try to wipe them out, it means poisoning the earth around them, it means poisoning\n\n41:16.640 --> 41:21.840\nthe entire biosphere, everything that eats those carcasses, all the plant life.\n\n41:21.840 --> 41:28.880\nAnd those people are even saying at this point, it's the only practical alternative to what\n\n41:28.880 --> 41:32.320\ncould actually be a really serious human impacting thing.\n\n41:32.320 --> 41:39.280\nSo the story compares it to the decision to do chemo, where you're just like, I'm just\n\n41:39.280 --> 41:46.920\ngoing to attack myself with something that kills everything and maybe won't kill me as\n\n41:46.920 --> 41:54.720\nmuch as it kills this thing because the feral pig problem is like that real, crazy.\n\n41:54.720 --> 41:59.280\nThis has been me recapping a podcast you should listen to.\n\n41:59.280 --> 42:01.640\nNow you don't have to listen to that episode.\n\n42:01.640 --> 42:08.000\nIt's our new segment called Mobile Pork Units, I read it down so I could remember.\n\n42:08.000 --> 42:12.600\nSome people, Cody at one point said, you know, we drink too much LaCroix and like it's got\n\n42:12.600 --> 42:14.120\nlike insecticide in it or something.\n\n42:14.120 --> 42:17.160\nI said, that sounds like fucking garbage talk.\n\n42:17.160 --> 42:18.160\nWhat is it?\n\n42:18.160 --> 42:22.320\nIt's like flavored with oil, essential oil, citrus things or something and everything\n\n42:22.320 --> 42:26.200\nthat has citrus in it has pesticides in it, I guess, I don't know.\n\n42:26.200 --> 42:30.960\nSo it's like, I think I'm drinking 12 cans of water, but really I'm drinking 12 cans\n\n42:30.960 --> 42:32.880\nof water with a little pesticide in it.\n\n42:32.880 --> 42:33.880\nBig deal.\n\n42:33.880 --> 42:34.880\nYou got to get it somewhere.\n\n42:34.880 --> 42:35.880\nBFD.\n\n42:35.880 --> 42:38.200\nYou got to get your pesticide something.\n\n42:38.200 --> 42:39.200\nYeah.\n\n42:39.200 --> 42:40.640\nCan I get a LaCroix out here?\n\n42:40.640 --> 42:41.640\nI got a craving.\n\n42:41.640 --> 42:43.440\nLike I just I'm addicted to LaCroix.\n\n42:43.440 --> 42:45.000\nWhat flavors do you like it on?\n\n42:45.000 --> 42:46.000\nI like them all.\n\n42:46.000 --> 42:47.240\nYou're gnawing on that lime.\n\n42:47.240 --> 42:49.080\nYeah, I mean, I like lime.\n\n42:49.080 --> 42:52.720\nI don't want, I don't want to pick a favorite flavor of LaCroix because I'm afraid then\n\n42:52.720 --> 43:06.720\nI'll be like, oh, Barry, you know, passion fruit, man, what even is a passion fruit?\n\n43:06.720 --> 43:08.200\nIt's me.\n\n43:08.200 --> 43:11.160\nOh, no, memory sprite.\n\n43:11.160 --> 43:18.560\nHe checked his notes, those notes, the notes came in handy.\n\n43:18.560 --> 43:27.760\nFor all hogs, for all hogs, I like when environmentally there's a pest that was brought in by accident,\n\n43:27.760 --> 43:36.560\nlike, like the Spanish brought in like hogs or like, and they terrorize the countryside.\n\n43:36.560 --> 43:41.920\nSo they go, oh, what you do is you bring in a bunch of snakes and the snakes go fucking\n\n43:41.920 --> 43:43.600\ncrazy and start killing everything.\n\n43:43.600 --> 43:48.520\nAnd then you go, you know, you need condors and then the condors are supposed to kill\n\n43:48.520 --> 43:49.520\nthe snakes.\n\n43:49.520 --> 43:52.720\nBut the condors sleep at night when the snakes are out killing everybody.\n\n43:52.720 --> 43:57.280\nAnd then you have to go, then you have to get a bunch of hunters to go kill the condors\n\n43:57.280 --> 43:59.520\nbecause they're eating every fucking, everything else.\n\n43:59.520 --> 44:05.760\nYeah, I like when people just don't think ahead and everything's just gone to shit.\n\n44:05.760 --> 44:06.760\nI like that.\n\n44:06.760 --> 44:07.760\nYeah.\n\n44:07.760 --> 44:08.760\nI love that.\n\n44:08.760 --> 44:12.600\nLike, what's the one like, they're like in Australia or New Zealand?\n\n44:12.600 --> 44:13.600\nKento.\n\n44:13.600 --> 44:14.600\nKento.\n\n44:14.600 --> 44:15.600\nToads.\n\n44:15.600 --> 44:16.600\nYeah.\n\n44:16.600 --> 44:22.000\nAnd then they brought in like a marsupial, like, like a fucking something to go eat them.\n\n44:22.000 --> 44:24.720\nBut like, no, but they're nocturnal.\n\n44:24.720 --> 44:30.080\nSo while one's asleep, the other one's awake, like, now everything's fucked.\n\n44:30.080 --> 44:31.560\nCan you imagine what it takes?\n\n44:31.560 --> 44:35.960\nThen you got to bring in Richard Attenborough, everything's fucked now in Australia.\n\n44:35.960 --> 44:36.960\nYeah.\n\n44:36.960 --> 44:44.800\nImagine what it takes to destabilize the Australian biosphere, like where 70% of everything is\n\n44:44.800 --> 44:45.800\na poison spider.\n\n44:45.800 --> 44:53.000\nAlso, they don't even know what a knife is.\n\n44:53.000 --> 44:57.320\nI mean, some people do, but I would think you could introduce anything from the world\n\n44:57.320 --> 45:02.240\nto the Australian biosphere, and it would bounce off like a ping pong ball, like, oh,\n\n45:02.240 --> 45:03.240\nno, I can't.\n\n45:03.240 --> 45:05.240\nThere's poison spiders here.\n\n45:05.240 --> 45:10.720\nLike, but no, some, some fucking toad like is wreaking havoc on I think it's like the\n\n45:10.720 --> 45:15.400\nopposite where they have they have several problems caused by several invasive species\n\n45:15.400 --> 45:18.840\nand it's like every one of those just really hit the ground running and now it's fucked.\n\n45:18.840 --> 45:22.640\nBecause like the Galapagos, like they're like a macro Galapagos where it's like they're\n\n45:22.640 --> 45:27.800\nso isolated that they have key and tumbler kind of like evolution going.\n\n45:27.800 --> 45:35.220\nMarsupials, case in point, the fucking giant rat with human biceps that like knock on your\n\n45:35.220 --> 45:36.720\npatio door.\n\n45:36.720 --> 45:39.040\nGod

just like banging on\n\n45:53.680 --> 45:54.680\ntheir glasses.\n\n45:54.680 --> 45:57.560\nLike if you type it into YouTube, there's just like seven videos and it's just like everyone\n\n45:57.560 --> 45:58.560\njust reacts the same way.\n\n45:58.560 --> 46:01.720\nThey're like, ah, you again, get the fuck out of here.\n\n46:01.720 --> 46:02.720\nGet out of here.\n\n46:02.720 --> 46:04.720\nI'm sick and tired of you.\n\n46:04.720 --> 46:07.400\nYou're sick and tired of fucking Pennywise.\n\n46:07.400 --> 46:09.720\nLike that's fucking great.\n\n46:09.720 --> 46:14.600\nYou get this guy's got spiders that crawl up the wall with birds in their mouths.\n\n46:14.600 --> 46:15.600\nIt's unfair.\n\n46:15.600 --> 46:16.600\nDinkum unfair.\n\n46:16.600 --> 46:27.840\nDinkum that was in your

werewolves.\n\n46:41.600 --> 46:47.440\nI always forget new rule.\n\n46:47.440 --> 46:48.600\nForget it.\n\n46:48.600 --> 46:53.240\nLet's forget Spencer without character sheets without

any comments about it.\n\n49:59.640 --> 50:00.640\nIt's really unruly.\n\n50:00.640 --> 50:04.640\nI wish I was Jewish so I could just say Jew, Jew, Jew all the time.\n\n50:04.640 --> 50:06.640\nI just want to say everything to Jew.\n\n50:06.640 --> 50:07.640\nI'm a Jew.\n\n50:07.640 --> 50:08.640\nIt sounds so dirty.\n\n50:08.640 --> 50:09.640\nIt's not really fro-y though.\n\n50:09.640 --> 50:11.640\nIt's just, it's just bushy.\n\n50:11.640 --> 50:13.640\nIt's not like, you're not fro-y.\n\n50:13.640 --> 50:16.640\nGive me some of that Jew food, mom.\n\n50:16.640 --> 50:17.640\nI

50:25.640\nYeah, like a latke and applesauce.\n\n50:25.640 --> 50:31.640\nA nice, you know, pastrami, corned beef sandwich.\n\n50:31.640 --> 50:35.640\nYour Jew fro is kind of like, it's molded.\n\n50:35.640 --> 50:38.640\nLike, are you trying to do something with it?\n\n50:38.640 --> 50:39.640\nNo, I just think it's wavy.\n\n50:39.640 --> 50:40.640\nIt has a mind of its own.\n\n50:40.640 --> 50:41.640\nIt's wavy and thick.\n\n50:41.640 --> 50:43.640\nI don't think you're fro-ing out.\n\n50:43.640 --> 50:45.640\nAre you just going to?\n\n50:45.640 --> 50:47.640\nTomorrow morning it will be.\n\n50:47.640 --> 50:49.640\nI think you need to tease it.\n\n50:49.640 --> 50:50.640\nNo, I'm wrong.\n\n50:50.640 --> 50:51.640\nI think it's fro-y.\n\n50:51.640 --> 50:53.640\nI think it's nervous.\n\n50:53.640 --> 50:59.640\nIf you're not pressing it in a helmet shape in the morning,\n\n50:59.640 --> 51:03.640\nthen what you have is hair that's been trained for 30 years\n\n51:03.640 --> 51:06.640\nto be ashamed of itself for living free.\n\n51:06.640 --> 51:08.640\nAnd so it's like trying to make, it's like, don't cut me.\n\n51:08.640 --> 51:11.640\nI can wear a helmet all day.\n\n51:11.640 --> 51:12.640\nTake it off.\n\n51:12.640 --> 51:14.640\nHour later, this.\n\n51:14.640 --> 51:17.640\nWell, that's what I'm saying.\n\n51:17.640 --> 51:20.640\nIt's like your hair, it looks kind of molded.\n\n51:20.640 --> 51:22.640\nLike a Play-Doh thing.\n\n51:22.640 --> 51:26.640\nIt's not like Matt Stone.\n\n51:26.640 --> 51:27.640\nRight, yeah, yeah.\n\n51:27.640 --> 51:29.640\nLike, just like free.\n\n51:29.640 --> 51:30.640\nIt's the same way every day.\n\n51:30.640 --> 51:31.640\nLike a poofy.\n\n51:31.640 --> 51:33.640\nThis will look different tomorrow.\n\n51:33.640 --> 51:35.640\nIt could be parted.\n\n51:35.640 --> 51:36.640\nYou can see my scalp.\n\n51:36.640 --> 51:38.640\nMaybe you should let it keep going\n\n51:38.640 --> 51:41.640\nso it can get its spirit back.\n\n51:41.640 --> 51:45.640\nSo it's not like Clark Kent with half a cape on.\n\n51:45.640 --> 51:48.640\nI see you just, you let it really just go\n\n51:48.640 --> 51:51.640\nand be like Leo Sayre or Gabe Kaplan.\n\n51:51.640 --> 51:52.640\nYeah.\n\n51:52.640 --> 51:53.640\nJust big ass.\n\n51:53.640 --> 51:55.640\nLet it start dreading up.\n\n51:55.640 --> 51:56.640\nYes.\n\n51:56.640 --> 51:58.640\nThat's a Leo Sayre reference.\n\n51:58.640 --> 51:59.640\nThank you, nobody.\n\n51:59.640 --> 52:02.640\nHow does that, how did dreadlocks work?\n\n52:02.640 --> 52:03.640\nHow do you get dreadlocks?\n\n52:03.640 --> 52:04.640\nI don't know.\n\n52:04.640 --> 52:06.640\nIs there a technique or is it just like a natural thing\n\n52:06.640 --> 52:07.640\nthat happens?\n\n52:07.640 --> 52:09.640\nIt's a technique.\n\n52:09.640 --> 52:11.640\nYou put mud and stuff?\n\n52:11.640 --> 52:14.640\nI have a photo of me with dreadlocks in high school.\n\n52:14.640 --> 52:17.640\nI'm just a white dude with dreadlocks and it's not cool.\n\n52:17.640 --> 52:18.640\nWell, okay.\n\n52:18.640 --> 52:19.640\nSo then you know how you get.\n\n52:19.640 --> 52:20.640\nHow do you do it?\n\n52:20.640 --> 52:23.640\nSalt water, like I was like a body border\n\n52:23.640 --> 52:25.640\nand so just sand and salt and neglect.\n\n52:25.640 --> 52:27.640\nSo it just happened naturally?\n\n52:27.640 --> 52:29.640\nYeah, but also like my hair gets long.\n\n52:29.640 --> 52:30.640\nI have nervous energy.\n\n52:30.640 --> 52:33.640\nSo I bite my nails, but also like I'm constantly\n\n52:33.640 --> 52:34.640\ntwisting my hair when it gets long.\n\n52:34.640 --> 52:35.640\nOkay.\n\n52:35.640 --> 52:37.640\nSo when it's got salt and sand in it,\n\n52:37.640 --> 52:39.640\nit just wants to kind of knot up a little, you know.\n\n52:39.640 --> 52:40.640\nOkay.\n\n52:40.640 --> 52:42.640\nBut it's something you kind of halfway,\n\n52:42.640 --> 52:44.640\nyou're sort of like, I think I'll do this now.\n\n52:44.640 --> 52:46.640\nLike you're like, I'm doing this anyway.\n\n52:46.640 --> 52:47.640\nAnd then you just did this a lot.\n\n52:47.640 --> 52:48.640\nDon't do it.\n\n52:48.640 --> 52:50.640\nI didn't say I was going to do it.\n\n52:50.640 --> 52:52.640\nI was just curious about how it works.\n\n52:52.640 --> 52:53.640\nAre we actually...\n\n52:53.640 --> 52:54.640\nNo, Dan, do it.\n\n52:54.640 --> 52:55.640\nGet dreadlocks.\n\n52:55.640 --> 52:59.640\nWhat if that was your weird midlife crisis\n\n52:59.640 --> 53:01.640\nwhere you just said, fuck it.\n\n53:01.640 --> 53:02.640\nI got one dreadlocks.\n\n53:02.640 --> 53:05.640\nI probably got six months left for dreadlocks being possible.\n\n53:05.640 --> 53:08.640\nI guess that would be a practical thing to do.\n\n53:08.640 --> 53:09.640\nAlso, your midlife crisis,\n\n53:09.640 --> 53:12.640\nwhat are you going to be, a fucking hundred?\n\n53:12.640 --> 53:13.640\nYeah, exactly.\n\n53:13.640 --> 53:14.640\nYeah.\n\n53:14.640 --> 53:15.640\nOkay.\n\n53:15.640 --> 53:16.640\nYou could do it.\n\n53:16.640 --> 53:18.640\nYour midlife crisis choices have to start like right now.\n\n53:18.640 --> 53:19.640\nYeah.\n\n53:19.640 --> 53:20.640\nYeah.\n\n53:20.640 --> 53:22.640\nBut dreadlocks would be fun for you.\n\n53:22.640 --> 53:23.640\nYeah.\n\n53:23.640 --> 53:25.640\nYou're in the pool all the time.\n\n53:25.640 --> 53:27.640\nYou have a workout thing on your Instagram.\n\n53:27.640 --> 53:29.640\nGetting complicated relationship with my hair\n\n53:29.640 --> 53:31.640\nbecause it's going away.\n\n53:31.640 --> 53:33.640\nAnd I'm like, I never liked you.\n\n53:33.640 --> 53:36.640\nBut like, come back.\n\n53:36.640 --> 53:38.640\nWait, are you getting bald?\n\n53:38.640 --> 53:40.640\nAre you getting bald or just kind of gradually ceding?\n\n53:40.640 --> 53:41.640\nOh, yeah.\n\n53:41.640 --> 53:42.640\nNo, I'm definitely...\n\n53:42.640 --> 53:43.640\nThat's all going away.\n\n53:43.640 --> 53:44.640\nYeah.\n\n53:44.640 --> 53:45.640\nDo you have the male pattern thing on the back?\n\n53:45.640 --> 53:46.640\nYeah.\n\n53:46.640 --> 53:47.640\nYeah.\n\n53:47.640 --> 53:48.640\nBut a beautiful beard.\n\n53:48.640 --> 53:49.640\nThank you.\n\n53:49.640 --> 53:50.640\nYour beard is luscious.\n\n53:50.640 --> 53:51.640\nYeah.\n\n53:51.640 --> 53:54.640\nIt's like the rivers of the Orinoco.\n\n53:54.640 --> 53:55.640\nYeah.\n\n53:55.640 --> 53:57.640\nBeards are just pubic hair in your face.\n\n53:57.640 --> 54:00.640\nI mean, it's not like, oh, he can grow a beard.\n\n54:00.640 --> 54:02.640\nWell,

facial hair, but it's patchy.\n\n54:08.640 --> 54:12.640\nAnd like, I look like Johnny Depp on a bad weekend.\n\n54:12.640 --> 54:14.640\nAre we actually playing D&D?\n\n54:14.640 -->

song, but it is.\n\n54:22.640 --> 54:24.640\nYou guys ready?\n\n54:24.640 --> 54:26.640\nHere we go.\n\n54:26.640 --> 54:27.640\nThe town of...\n\n54:27.640 --> 54:32.640\nYou found the town of Potos Donos, the farming village.\n\n54:32.640 --> 54:33.640\nThere's about...\n\n54:33.640 --> 54:34.640\nIt's not much of a farming village.\n\n54:34.640 --> 54:38.640\nThere's like six farms, and there's only a handful of people.\n\n54:38.640 --> 54:40.640\nYou haven't really met them.\n\n54:40.640 --> 54:41.640\nYou just kind of...\n\n54:41.640 --> 54:42.640\nYou rolled up on a farm.\n\n54:42.640 --> 54:44.640\nYou killed a fucking ghost that was haunting the farm.\n\n54:44.640 --> 54:47.640\nAnd then you're like, well, I'm going to take this farm now.\n\n54:47.640 --> 54:49.640\nPotato basket!\n\n54:49.640 --> 54:51.640\nDoes this seem kind of diminishing?\n\n54:51.640 --> 54:54.640\nLike we used to be fighters, and you had like ambitions.\n\n54:54.640 --> 54:56.640\nLook me in the eye and say that you're happy right now.\n\n54:56.640 --> 54:58.640\nI can't tell you that.\n\n54:58.640 --> 55:01.640\nThere's one rival farmer, Kettemene.\n\n55:01.640 --> 55:02.640\nKett...\n\n55:02.640 --> 55:03.640\nAlright.\n\n55:03.640 --> 55:06.640\nWe should make friends with her and learn to farm better.\n\n55:06.640 --> 55:07.640\nWe hear a knock at the door?\n\n55:07.640 --> 55:08.640\nYeah.\n\n55:08.640 --> 55:09.640\nIt's a raccoon man.\n\n55:09.640 --> 55:10.640\nGlad you're settling in.\n\n55:10.640 --> 55:13.640\nYou do owe a lot of money for this property.\n\n55:13.640 --> 55:14.640\nI hear a fire.\n\n55:14.640 --> 55:15.640\nThat tree is on fire.\n\n55:15.640 --> 55:19.640\nAnd arguing about that wraith is a woman who looks like a druid.\n\n55:19.640 --> 55:22.640\nAnd she's yelling at a small mole.\n\n55:22.640 --> 55:25.640\nI go, hey, what's the beef?\n\n55:25.640 --> 55:27.640\nYou want to take care of this mole, get him off my back.\n\n55:27.640 --> 55:29.640\nAlright, well, I think I can settle this.\n\n55:29.640 --> 55:30.640\nThis is our property.\n\n55:30.640 --> 55:32.640\nThe mole's pissed and leaves.\n\n55:32.640 --> 55:34.640\nYou know about the church of Korlax?\n\n55:34.640 --> 55:35.640\nI'm a worshipper.\n\n55:35.640 --> 55:37.640\nI want to, like, I'll do anything,\n\n55:37.640 -->

55:53.640\nWe should become musicians.\n\n55:53.640 --> 55:55.640\nI'm willing to give that a try.\n\n55:55.640 --> 55:56.640\nWe'll go down to the town,\n\n55:56.640 --> 55:59.640\nand we'll see if there's any music.\n\n55:59.640 --> 56:00.640\nJobs?\n\n56:00.640 --> 56:01.640\nThat's a story.\n\n56:01.640 --> 56:08.640\nI'm so inspired.\n\n56:08.640 --> 56:11.640\nBaby Schumers.\n\n56:11.640 --> 56:13.640\nBaby Schumer.\n\n56:13.640 --> 56:17.640\nThat didn't help me at all.\n\n56:17.640 --> 56:21.640\nI'm more confused than I was before that play.\n\n56:21.640 --> 56:23.640\nIt jacked some memories for me.\n\n56:23.640 --> 56:26.640\nWe were living on a potato farm.\n\n56:26.640 --> 56:27.640\nI had a stroke.\n\n56:27.640 --> 56:32.640\nWe were about to go to town and see if there were any music jobs.\n\n56:32.640 --> 56:33.640\nYeah.\n\n56:33.640 --> 56:35.640\nNow imagine what it would have been like to hear that\n\n56:35.640 --> 56:38.640\nlike the week after you did those events, huh?\n\n56:38.640 --> 56:40.640\nWouldn't that be crazy?\n\n56:40.640 --> 56:42.640\nYeah, it would make me mad.\n\n56:42.640 --> 56:45.640\nOkay, I examine my surroundings.\n\n56:45.640 --> 56:47.640\nYou're in the farmhouse,\n\n56:47.640 --> 56:49.640\nthe farmhouse where you live.\n\n56:49.640 --> 56:50.640\nYou were out farming.\n\n56:50.640 --> 56:52.640\nOh boy, you didn't like it.\n\n56:52.640 --> 56:54.640\nYou hated it, especially Jeff.\n\n56:54.640 --> 56:56.640\nEveryone else was kind of fine with it.\n\n56:56.640 --> 57:00.640\nYeah, but I want to go get into adventures.\n\n57:00.640 --> 57:02.640\nYeah.\n\n57:02.640 --> 57:06.640\nYou guys talked about how you might want to just become a music band\n\n57:06.640 --> 57:10.640\nand try and do that for money.\n\n57:10.640 --> 57:14.640\nDo you guys want to become a music band for money?\n\n57:14.640 --> 57:16.640\nLike Troubadours?\n\n57:16.640 --> 57:18.640\nAre we near a town?\n\n57:18.640 --> 57:19.640\nYou're in a town.\n\n57:19.640 --> 57:21.640\nYou belong to a town.\n\n57:21.640 --> 57:26.640\nI walk into the local tavern that might host musical events.\n\n57:26.640 --> 57:27.640\nThere's a local tavern.\n\n57:27.640 --> 57:29.640\nOkay, I go into that musical tavern.\n\n57:29.640 --> 57:31.640\nAll right, you do that.\n\n57:31.640 --> 57:34.640\nAre you guys doing that too?\n\n57:34.640 --> 57:38.640\nI'm going to putter around the kitchen for a little bit.\n\n57:38.640 --> 57:41.640\nHow much money do we have?\n\n57:41.640 --> 57:43.640\nFunctionally none.\n\n57:43.640 --> 57:46.640\nMaybe like 200 gold or something.\n\n57:46.640 --> 57:48.640\nAre potatoes worth anything?\n\n57:48.640 --> 57:49.640\nYou haven't sold them yet.\n\n57:49.640 --> 57:51.640\nThe harvest isn't complete.\n\n57:51.640 --> 57:52.640\nYou just started to get some.\n\n57:52.640 --> 57:54.640\nWe've been eating them.\n\n57:54.640 --> 57:56.640\nThey're too good not

the Creaky Grieve and I ask for the manager.\n\n58:06.640 --> 58:08.640\nYou see the tavern keeper.\n\n58:08.640 --> 58:11.640\nHis name's Cool Dennis.\n\n58:11.640 --> 58:13.640\nOh, shit.\n\n58:13.640 --> 58:15.640\nIt's coming back to me now.\n\n58:15.640 --> 58:18.640\nYeah, you last saw him at a different tavern.\n\n58:18.640 --> 58:20.640\nHey, Cool Dennis.\n\n58:20.640 --> 58:23.640\nMy friends and I are working kind of a new musical act.\n\n58:23.640 --> 58:27.640\nYou guys have like an open mic night or an open spot?\n\n58:27.640 --> 58:28.640\nOh, yeah.\n\n58:28.640 --> 58:30.640\nWe got this little stage up here.\n\n58:30.640 --> 58:34.640\nPeople can throw small denominations of coins at you.\n\n58:34.640 --> 58:37.640\nOkay, we're pretty thin on the coin\n\n58:37.640 --> 58:39.640\nso we could maybe use that money.\n\n58:39.640 --> 58:40.640\nWhat do you play?\n\n58:40.640 --> 58:45.640\nI play tambourine and so does everybody else.\n\n58:45.640 --> 58:49.640\nIt's the first all tambourine trio.\n\n58:57.640 --> 59:02.640\nWe only have one tambourine so we just pass.\n\n59:02.640 --> 59:05.640\nWe pass around.\n\n59:05.640 --> 59:07.640\nIt was sounding cool until that part.\n\n59:07.640 --> 59:09.640\nI was like, oh, that is kind of cool.\n\n59:09.640 --> 59:12.640\nBut then it's like now it's a shared chamber.\n\n59:12.640 --> 59:17.640\nYes, we're just slowly out of our luck wayward adventurers\n\n59:17.640 --> 59:20.640\nthat are trying to farm potatoes.\n\n59:20.640 --> 59:22.640\nBut we got the tambourine, but I got to tell you,\n\n59:22.640 --> 59:26.640\nit's the harmonies, which is the real show grabber.\n\n59:26.640 --> 59:27.640\nSure.\n\n59:27.640 --> 59:29.640\nWell, I'm no talent scout.\n\n59:29.640 --> 59:32.640\nIf you want to grab whatever instruments and come in tonight,\n\n59:32.640 --> 59:34.640\nthat sounds like a thing you could do.\n\n59:34.640 --> 59:36.640\nOkay, go ahead.\n\n59:36.640 --> 59:38.640\nI'm at the house.\n\n59:38.640 --> 59:39.640\nWhat time is it?\n\n59:39.640 --> 59:41.640\nLet's say it's 11 a.m.\n\n59:41.640 --> 59:45.640\nThe day after the events of the last episode we played.\n\n59:45.640 --> 59:46.640\nOkay.\n\n59:46.640 --> 59:49.640\nIs Diarrhea Jr. at the house?\n\n59:49.640 --> 59:51.640\nYeah, unless he leaves.\n\n59:51.640 --> 59:53.640\nI'm still at the house.\n\n59:53.640 --> 59:54.640\nDiarrhea.\n\n59:54.640 --> 59:55.640\nYes.\n\n59:55.640 --> 59:59.640\nLet's head out of town and meet up with Chad.\n\n59:59.640 --> 01:00:02.640\nI just want to lock down the farm,\n\n01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:08.640\nmake sure we're not leaving any animals open.\n\n01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:13.640\nWe should sew up those animals.\n\n01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:14.640\nAll right.\n\n01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:15.640\nWell, you don't have to.\n\n01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:18.640\nI knew it farming.\n\n01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:21.640\nWe did harvest that cow for meat.\n\n01:00:21.640 --> 01:00:23.640\nNo, you did.\n\n01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:24.640\nWe did it.\n\n01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:27.640\nI mean the pins and the barns and shits.\n\n01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:28.640\nLet's close it up.\n\n01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:32.640\nYeah, just bumper crop of sarcasm.\n\n01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:33.640\nAll right.\n\n01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:35.640\nI've shuttered the kitchen.\n\n01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:38.640\nDid you check the corral?\n\n01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:40.640\nYeah, pin.\n\n01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:41.640\nEveryone's good.\n\n01:00:41.640 -->

to the town.\n\n01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:49.640\nLet's head on down.\n\n01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:51.640\nShould we take horses?\n\n01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:55.640\nYeah, I love horses.\n\n01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:56.640\nDo we own horses?\n\n01:00:56.640 --> 01:00:58.640\nI think you have one horse from the past.\n\n01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:00.640\nWhy don't you take the horse?\n\n01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:02.640\nNo, no, we could ride it together.\n\n01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:03.640\nOkay.\n\n01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:04.640\nI'm pretty light.\n\n01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:05.640\nAll right.\n\n01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:07.640\nI'll get on the back.\n\n01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:08.640\nOkay.\n\n01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:11.640\nWe get on the horse and we ride to town.\n\n01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:13.640\nYou get on the horse.\n\n01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:15.640\nOh, it doesn't like that.\n\n01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:16.640\nWhat?\n\n01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:20.640\nIt starts bucking under your legs.\n\n01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:23.640\nWell, is it because there's two of us?\n\n01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:27.640\nIt's because you rolled low.\n\n01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:31.640\nOh, I'll get off.\n\n01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:34.640\nI'll get off too.\n\n01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:35.640\nWe both get off.\n\n01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:40.640\nI start stroking the horse's head and I'm like, hey, man, it's us.\n\n01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:42.640\nDon't don't even don't even trip.\n\n01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:43.640\nWe love you.\n\n01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:44.640\nWe love where horse

friends.\n\n01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:51.640\nWe're never going to go away.\n\n01:01:51.640 --> 01:01:53.640\nDon't pay attention to the low rolls.\n\n01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:54.640\nThink about those high rolls.\n\n01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:56.640\nWe're going to sit on you for the rest of your life.\n\n01:01:56.640 --> 01:01:58.640\nWe love we love you.\n\n01:01:58.640 --> 01:01:59.640\nHere's a

your own instruments.\n\n01:04:57.180 --> 01:04:59.640\nThen you could like be masters of the craft.\n\n01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:00.640\nBards.\n\n01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:02.920\nDo you know someone that

loot.\n\n01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:29.400\nWell, that won't work.\n\n01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:30.800\nWhat you just said that you could do that.\n\n01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:31.800\nI can do that.\n\n01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:32.800\nBut what?\n\n01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:33.800\nI rolled.\n\n01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:35.280\nShe's not easily manipulated.\n\n01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:37.920\nThat's not the that's not the right kind of seedling.\n\n01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:41.920\nI can do it for you, but I don't just, you know, do my magic powers for free.\n\n01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:42.920\nWhat?\n\n01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:43.920\nWhat?\n\n01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:44.920\nWe're kind of low on the dough right now.\n\n01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:45.920\nYou can't turn potatoes into

Ocarina.\n\n01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:38.400\nNow that, that I don't even need to use magic.\n\n01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:39.400\nWhat?\n\n01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:40.600\nYou just know how to make them?\n\n01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:41.600\nYeah.\n\n01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:44.200\nYou just carve holes in a potato.\n\n01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:45.400\nThat is what it is.\n\n01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:46.600\nA sweet potato.\n\n01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:48.680\nI like to think that I made my instruments.\n\n01:06:48.680 --> 01:06:51.480\nSo yeah, yeah, potato, Ocarina.\n\n01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:52.480\nLet's do it.\n\n01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:53.480\nOkay.\n\n01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:54.480\nPotato.\n\n01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:55.480\nOcarina.\n\n01:06:55.480 --> 01:07:01.840\nI, but you guys, you got to do me a favor first, you know, I don't just like do do spells\n\n01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:02.840\nfor no one.\n\n01:07:02.840 --> 01:07:03.840\nNope.\n\n01:07:03.840 --> 01:07:04.840\nWhat kind of favor are we talking?\n\n01:07:04.840 --> 01:07:06.340\nNo quid pro quo.\n\n01:07:06.340 --> 01:07:12.840\nWell, as you know, as you may already know, I live in a tree, right, and the tree is recently\n\n01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:18.600\nbesieged by monsters, what kind of monsters?\n\n01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:19.600\nFeral hogs.\n\n01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:25.160\nOh, damn.\n\n01:07:25.160 --> 01:07:28.480\nBut these are no ordinary feral hogs.\n\n01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:32.360\nThey're extraordinary.\n\n01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:33.520\nIn what way?\n\n01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:38.640\nThey're harder to kill and they do crazy stuff that you wouldn't expect a feral hog to do.\n\n01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:39.920\nSo what do you want us to do?\n\n01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:40.920\nKill them.\n\n01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:44.320\nAre we carrying any of our weapons?\n\n01:07:44.320 --> 01:07:48.560\nNo, those have been locked away in the closets of your farmhouse because you don't use them\n\n01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:49.920\nfor farming.\n\n01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:52.480\nCan you turn potatoes into weapons?\n\n01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:55.120\nYeah, I can.\n\n01:07:55.120 --> 01:07:58.840\nHow much does that cost?\n\n01:07:58.840 --> 01:08:02.840\nIf you use them primarily for the quest, I could do those.\n\n01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:03.840\nI could do those right now.\n\n01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:10.120\nI could do you for hand grenades, but what you could turn potatoes into hand grenades.\n\n01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:11.120\nYeah.\n\n01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:13.960\nDo you ever bake a potato without poking holes in it?\n\n01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:15.680\nIt's kind of like that.\n\n01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:18.840\nDo I still have my native druid fire abilities?\n\n01:08:18.840 --> 01:08:24.200\nYeah, yeah, you have a produce flame and like a scorching beam.\n\n01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:29.680\nI take a potato and I use my fire to bake a potato.\n\n01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:30.680\nYou do that.\n\n01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:37.320\nOh boy, it looks so delicious and it only takes one hour.\n\n01:08:37.320 --> 01:08:41.200\nThat's what magic does for you.\n\n01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:43.960\nAre you trying to prove that we don't need her?\n\n01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:46.400\nI mean, I'm just trying to be active.\n\n01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:49.320\nWow, this guy can't keep it together.\n\n01:08:49.320 --> 01:08:52.120\nShe's like, I can make you a potato hand grenade.\n\n01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:53.120\nOkay, okay, cool.\n\n01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:54.120\nI could bake a potato.\n\n01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:58.880\nIt's like baking a potato and you're like, I'd take a potato and bake it, like you're\n\n01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:00.840\nall over the place.\n\n01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:02.080\nI just want to be...\n\n01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:05.080\nThis guy needs to get his energy out on those boars.\n\n01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:06.080\nYeah.\n\n01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:09.920\nOkay, well, this is what we got to do.\n\n01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:10.920\nHere we go.\n\n01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:14.360\nSo, Kogara, what's her name?\n\n01:09:14.360 --> 01:09:15.360\nKogara.\n\n01:09:15.360 --> 01:09:18.160\nKogara, make us some potato grenades.\n\n01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:19.160\nAll right.\n\n01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:24.360\nI'll come back in an hour for the one that I'm baking and then let's go out there and\n\n01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:28.640\nkick a little feral hog dick.\n\n01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:34.680\nAll right, I'll meet you by the tree and here's a map I'm drawing on the dirt to show you\n\n01:09:34.680 --> 01:09:35.920\nwhere it is.\n\n01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:40.160\nIs our house on the way because we could, John Wick, pull a little bit, you know?\n\n01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:41.160\nYeah, we could.\n\n01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:44.360\nBreak open those cabinets, put on those outfits.\n\n01:09:44.360 --> 01:09:46.960\nYeah, they're all buried in the floor.\n\n01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:48.480\nThey mess with the wrong guy.\n\n01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:49.960\nHow far away is our crib?\n\n01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:51.160\nIt's pretty close.\n\n01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:59.000\nOkay, let's go strap up and get our weapons and we'll meet you back at the tree, Kogara,\n\n01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:03.040\nand potato grenades and all, and we're going to have our own weapons ready to rock.\n\n01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:04.040\nThat sounds good.\n\n01:10:04.040 --> 01:10:05.040\nOkay.\n\n01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:06.040\nThanks for the map.\n\n01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:07.040\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:10.960\nIt's more powerful than us, why couldn't she take care of her own hogs?\n\n01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:13.360\nDo you think she feels sorry for us?\n\n01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:17.040\nIs this like a thing like, like, like give a homeless guy a job?\n\n01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:20.680\nI think she's just lazy.\n\n01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:24.160\nYou don't think she like sees us as self-esteem risks?\n\n01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:30.200\nLike, like, like, she's like, oh, jeez, these guys are, I think she sees us as disposable.\n\n01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:35.760\nLike why not just use hired labor to go out and do some dirty work?\n\n01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:36.760\nNo.\n\n01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:40.920\nWell, let's show her what we're made of because we're not potato farmers.\n\n01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:41.920\nThat was never us.\n\n01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:42.920\nWe're potato musicians.\n\n01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:45.760\nOur heart was never in that.\n\n01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:51.640\nWe're tambourine players, and now we're going to go show her what's the fucking real deal.\n\n01:10:51.640 --> 01:10:54.000\nWe're going to, we're going to grab our weapons.\n\n01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.120\nOh, am I keeping you up?\n\n01:10:56.120 --> 01:11:03.920\nCarlos, do you need a nap?\n\n01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:04.920\nIt is true.\n\n01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:13.680\nWe had to, we had a screening, the Rick and Morty offices, a real emotional depleter.\n\n01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:15.920\nI forgot my Adderall this morning.\n\n01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:19.480\nI'm really, really ready to take a nap.\n\n01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:22.280\nDaria, what's up with Carlos?\n\n01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:23.280\nHe's fucking.\n\n01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:24.280\nHe's fucking gibberish.\n\n01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:25.280\nHe's fucking nonsense.\n\n01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:27.280\nWhat do you think he is?\n\n01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:28.280\nWhat's a Rick and Morty?\n\n01:11:28.280 --> 01:11:30.360\nAre they his old partners that he lost?\n\n01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:31.360\nAdderall?\n\n01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:32.360\nWhat?\n\n01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:34.440\nIt might be his old flame.\n\n01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:35.440\nIt could be.\n\n01:11:35.440 --> 01:11:37.080\nAll right.\n\n01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:43.560\nWe walk back to the Ghostbusters firehouse that is our potato farm.\n\n01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:46.840\nI forget what my primary weapon is, Spencer.\n\n01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:47.840\nDo you recall?\n\n01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:49.520\nI think you usually just shoot fire.\n\n01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:50.520\nOkay.\n\n01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:53.520\nSpencer, I punch holes in the floorboards with my fists.\n\n01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:54.800\nHoly shit.\n\n01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:57.000\nI can see your resolve.\n\n01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.960\nSomeone's talking about a Baba Yaga somewhere.\n\n01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:02.680\nMan, I just watched John Wick 3.\n\n01:12:02.680 --> 01:12:03.680\nThat movie was good.\n\n01:12:03.680 --> 01:12:04.680\nI liked it.\n\n01:12:04.680 --> 01:12:05.680\nI haven't seen it yet.\n\n01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:06.680\nMy friend didn't like it, but I like it.\n\n01:12:06.680 --> 01:12:08.240\nI've never seen any John Wick's.\n\n01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:09.240\nThe first one's good.\n\n01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:10.240\nThe second one's less good.\n\n01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:11.240\nThird one's good.\n\n01:12:11.240 --> 01:12:12.240\nThird one's good.\n\n01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:13.240\nReally?\n\n01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:14.240\nWhat's the premise?\n\n01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:15.240\nWhat is a John Wick?\n\n01:12:15.240 --> 01:12:16.240\nWhat does it?\n\n01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:17.240\nWhat does he do?\n\n01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:21.800\nWell, he tries to get out, but they keep pulling him back in.\n\n01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:26.080\nThe first one introduces you to the idea that there's a John Wick.\n\n01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:31.360\nAnd the second one is like, of course, there's lots of John Wick's and like John Wick has\n\n01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:34.680\nto, there's like hotels where you can stay if you're a John Wick.\n\n01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:35.680\nIs he a spy?\n\n01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:36.680\nIs he a super power?\n\n01:12:36.680 --> 01:12:37.680\nHe's an assassin.\n\n01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:44.400\nThere's a whole, it's just sort of like a, there's an eighth grade boy realm to the universe\n\n01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:46.320\nwhere everyone's an assassin.\n\n01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:48.240\nYour waiter's an assassin.\n\n01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:50.240\nThe people he's waiting on are assassins.\n\n01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:54.040\nThey only don't assassinate each other because no one's paying them to, and there's some\n\n01:12:54.040 --> 01:12:58.160\ncode where you're staying at the Waldorf Astoria and you're not allowed to assassinate.\n\n01:12:58.160 --> 01:13:03.200\nJohn Wick does anyway, because he really wants someone dead and then El Swear Engine is like,\n\n01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:05.120\ndo you realize what you've done?\n\n01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:09.840\nGod damn it, if we do a John Wick three, you're going to fight the world.\n\n01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:13.520\nAnd then everyone in New York looks at him and they're all like assassins.\n\n01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:19.600\nAnd I swear to God, that's how John Wick 2 ends with John Wick, like El Swear Engine\n\n01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:21.360\nfrom Ian McShane.\n\n01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:26.440\nIt goes, he goes, I'll give you a 10 second head start.\n\n01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:32.120\nAnd then John Wick starts walking and as the credits are going to start rolling, it's\n\n01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:37.640\nlike this music is swelling as Keanu Reeves is walking past everyone in New York and there's\n\n01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:42.640\nlike a guy in a cowboy hat with an eyepatch looking at him and talking into his cuff.\n\n01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:46.800\nAnd then there's like an old woman with a dog and the dog's eyes roll back and two guns\n\n01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:47.800\ncome out.\n\n01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:59.640\nIt's like this music is building like John Wick 3 is either never going to get shot or\n\n01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:05.280\nthat movie is going to be fucking insane, because the second one was, I want to use\n\n01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:14.040\nthe word retarded, but I honestly think retarded people will be like, that's fine.\n\n01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:18.600\nThey'd be like, I don't because I don't know what other word like applies and my sister's\n\n01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:19.600\nretarded.\n\n01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:27.640\nSo like and she I think if she saw John Wick, she'd be like, yeah, that's retarded.\n\n01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:34.560\nI really do because at one point he goes to a guy named the Somalia who you get your weapons\n\n01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:35.560\nfrom this guy.\n\n01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:36.560\nSomalia.\n\n01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:43.560\nYeah, his his gimmick is he talks about weapons like he's a waiter like so he goes like would\n\n01:14:43.560 --> 01:14:49.720\nyou like something like something to go with the fish, but he's like holding a gun.\n\n01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:51.400\nBut here's the crazy thing.\n\n01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:55.520\nThere's no one else around and there's nothing but guns everywhere, so there's no point in\n\n01:14:55.520 --> 01:14:56.520\nusing a code.\n\n01:14:56.520 --> 01:15:00.840\nAnd then he says like guy you go to he just refer to everything was like he takes out a\n\n01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:05.480\nego and how about some pineapple dessert and it's like a hand grenade and like why is he\n\n01:15:05.480 --> 01:15:07.920\nmaking this harder than it has to be.\n\n01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:12.240\nIt goes both ways because he's like I'm going to need something for an after dinner jacket\n\n01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:16.200\nor something and then he pulls out a gun and he's like this is a clock p twenty two or\n\n01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:17.200\nwhatever.\n\n01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:22.560\nIt's like you said you say what type of gun this is and then you go back into weird like\n\n01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:28.000\nassassin creed and everybody pays each other with like these weird sand dollars from ancient\n\n01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:33.560\ng g g like stonehenge that have needles in them and you like close them on your palms\n\n01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:37.760\nand you have got a little John Wick blood in a sundial and that means that you work\n\n01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:41.760\nfor someone and these are good movies or I like the first.\n\n01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:43.280\nDid you like the first one?\n\n01:15:43.280 --> 01:15:48.000\nI like the I like the first one as much as everybody else did and I I honestly I watched\n\n01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:54.640\nthe second one by myself and I was like look at least this movie ain't lying to itself.\n\n01:15:54.640 --> 01:15:56.160\nYeah, I watched the first one.\n\n01:15:56.160 --> 01:16:01.240\nI was like this is like maybe a perfect movie like this is so good and then the second one.\n\n01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:04.840\nI was like this is not what I wanted.\n\n01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:09.520\nI watched them back to back and I was going to be a lot of planes coming up and I should\n\n01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:13.640\nI watch number one and I'd say watch all of them and skip number two or do I just feel\n\n01:16:13.640 --> 01:16:18.120\nlike I like I kind of like number two more than number why I feel like number one took\n\n01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:22.720\nitself a little too seriously given what all it was was just kind of shooting a million\n\n01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:24.360\npeople in the head.\n\n01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:30.680\nAnd like this walking dead CG blood coming out and like I was like like the whole movie\n\n01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:36.080\nis just like they do them wrong in the beginning because they don't know he's John Wick and\n\n01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:43.560\nthen like the only threshold is that the bad guy in the movie that's older says to his\n\n01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:51.560\nson you did what to who do you know who this guy is he's John Wick.\n\n01:16:51.560 --> 01:17:03.080\nWe used to call him the wick you know why he's never lit but once he is no mosquitoes\n\n01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:08.440\ncome around whatever but it's like his son's like I don't fucking care I'm uncockado care\n\n01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:13.440\nlet him come and he's like you won't see him coming and then there's no conflict the rest\n\n01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:17.160\nof the movie is just counter he's going from fucking place to place it's like people are\n\n01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:29.920\nlike hey that's far enough let me frisk you okay and then like the last guy of like a\n\n01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:37.080\nhundred guys in that warehouse it's like where is the next building full of people it's it's\n\n01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:43.680\na block away it's it's a bathhouse it's a bathhouse and he's thanks shoots him in the\n\n01:17:43.680 --> 01:17:49.240\nhead and then he cuts to like a Greek guy going like I'm telling you anyways to continue\n\n01:17:49.240 --> 01:17:54.800\nmy conversation you don't know who this guy is and then it cuts to fucking bathhouse\n\n01:17:54.800 --> 01:18:01.120\nI swear that's the whole fucking movie so the whole movie is act to yes and then and\n\n01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:06.440\nthen and then like the bad guy is just like his dad yelled at him enough where he gets\n\n01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:10.040\nit that's the other thing is like he's not like walking Phoenix and gladiator where\n\n01:18:10.040 --> 01:18:14.520\nhe's like fuck you old man I'll deal with you know like I'm he's like the guy the kid\n\n01:18:14.520 --> 01:18:18.960\nis like okay it sounds like I fucked up also the dad's like really hard to kill and he's\n\n01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:22.960\ngonna come kill me and so the kid just like sits in a fucking ninth warehouse and he's\n\n01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:28.080\njust like there waiting what what are the stakes like how do you take John Wick down\n\n01:18:28.080 --> 01:18:33.680\nor you just don't you don't obviously don't shoot you in the head and yeah he just shoots\n\n01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:38.120\neveryone in the head and then John Wick just that's why I like John Wick to a little better\n\n01:18:38.120 --> 01:18:43.760\nbecause at least it's like the movie seems to agree a little bit more that everything\n\n01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:49.080\nis like as I said although I won't keep using the word it starts with an R but like it it\n\n01:18:49.080 --> 01:18:53.640\njust seemed like the movie and you are in the same page for John Wick to where it's\n\n01:18:53.640 --> 01:19:02.200\nlike yeah it beats government work right I watching the movie yeah what if I'm on a\n\n01:19:02.200 --> 01:19:06.920\nplane and I want to just start with number three is that a bad idea I think it's a great\n\n01:19:06.920 --> 01:19:12.960\nidea I mean you could do it but I think it's yeah I don't know what he does a lot of stuff\n\n01:19:12.960 --> 01:19:18.000\nthat doesn't quite make sense if you don't know what's happening I I asked the writer's\n\n01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:26.440\nassistant and Rick and Morty when a couple months ago he said I saw John Wick 3 I said\n\n01:19:26.440 --> 01:19:32.200\nso they do they make good on the promises of John Wick 2 or this is like the whole world's\n\n01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:39.800\nan assassin and he's like yeah I don't know who makes their food which is what I wanted\n\n01:19:39.800 --> 01:19:46.200\nto hear you can't get an Uber like it's just everyone's yeah oh you can get an Uber but\n\n01:19:46.200 --> 01:20:01.600\nit'll be the Uber mmm I make a five stars well I recommend you drop me off before my\n\n01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:12.880\ndestination oh clever what was the story and stop me if I told it before about the Peter\n\n01:20:12.880 --> 01:20:17.480\nO'Toole's being interviewed and he

and\n\n01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:14.960\nit's like all the music's mounting and then in the background of the shot I'm opening\n\n01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:21.280\na cabinet and that's all and then I hand him his stuff well then what's in the floorboards\n\n01:21:21.280 --> 01:21:28.240\nright that's the joke no I know what is oh it's my it's my so church of the silver flame\n\n01:21:28.240 -->

and whatnot yep you get those you might have a knife too but yeah\n\n01:21:52.520 --> 01:21:56.560\nyou usually just shoot fire I think I guess the joke one version of the joke I'm not really\n\n01:21:56.560 --> 01:22:01.520\na joke writer but really he's paint he punches through the floor he's just there's always\n\n01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:04.360\npunching through the floor the music suggests that there's gonna be something under there\n\n01:22:04.360 --> 01:22:09.000\nand then I and I open a cabinet and I hand him a bundle of his stuff and he looks at\n\n01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:15.840\nit and he's like I thought I thought you were gonna put it into the floorboards and I'm\n\n01:22:15.840 --> 01:22:26.920\nlike why why would I do that like like what a horrible way his his his another another\n\n01:22:26.920 --> 01:22:31.080\npitch well like while he's punching holes in the floor and you not you Carlos and I don't\n\n01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:35.840\nunderstand why he's doing that we get our weapons out and including his right that we\n\n01:22:35.840 --> 01:22:40.680\nkeep in our weapon cabinet right yeah and and then we walk over to him and we hand him\n\n01:22:40.680 --> 01:22:47.640\nwood and tools to repair the floor that he broke for no reason yeah what if what if that's\n\n01:22:47.640 --> 01:22:51.360\nwhat we'll come out of our security what if that's what that's what he pulls like hammers\n\n01:22:51.360 --> 01:23:00.000\nand nails in all these places he puts them back that's way better than what he reaches\n\n01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:07.000\nin and pulls out wait he goes okay here's here's here it is there's a little lateral\n\n01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:12.600\nbut like he he he punches through the floorboards and then so far it's been so straightforward\n\n01:23:12.600 --> 01:23:17.520\nwhile he's doing it like I open up the cabinet and I pull out like three bundles of stuff\n\n01:23:17.520 --> 01:23:21.480\nand the third bundle I put in front of him and he's like he's just finished like punching\n\n01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:27.600\nthrough the took a while to break through and as he finishes I put the his stuff in front\n\n01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:32.240\nof him he goes what's that I go it's your stuff and he goes what's down here and he\n\n01:23:32.240 --> 01:23:39.880\nreaches down and pulls up floorboards lumber and nails yeah okay you fucking stuff that\n\n01:23:39.880 --> 01:23:44.440\nyou're gonna use to fix the floor yeah okay I think I think we got that joke locked down\n\n01:23:44.440 --> 01:23:53.160\nthis one what do you what do you guys think I think you saved the picture this one's way\n\n01:23:53.160 --> 01:23:58.560\nworse but just to say it like he opens up he opens up the floor and he pulls out a box\n\n01:23:58.560 --> 01:24:01.960\nand there's all these like golden assassin coins in it and then you you put down the\n\n01:24:01.960 --> 01:24:05.760\nweapons and then Steve like puts the coin in like a quarter machine and bubble gum comes\n\n01:24:05.760 --> 01:24:10.720\nout and he just choose it and it's like he was just doing that he was just trying to\n\n01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:18.920\nget some gum I said it was worse but I think it's better than yours or like he punches\n\n01:24:18.920 --> 01:24:26.560\nthe floor and then what he pulls out is a book that says like dealing with stress anger\n\n01:24:26.560 --> 01:24:34.560\nmanagement stupid wait don't don't wrap your hands don't we have a cowster killer what\n\n01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:39.800\nare we doing yeah pigs pigs hogs like I he punches through the floor and then he pulls\n\n01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:48.840\nout of he he he pulls out a book that says anger management and he goes like and we

buffing their combat skills and increasing their confidence all right you\n\n01:34:14.880 --> 01:34:20.200\nyou consecrate the area for our listeners who didn't see that Dan just put his glasses\n\n01:34:20.200 --> 01:34:28.160\non while he said that in a very nonchalant kind of groovy professorial way that happens\n\n01:34:28.160 --> 01:34:35.920\nthe pigs attack they god fuck they miss they all miss why are you mad why are you on their\n\n01:34:35.920 --> 01:34:42.160\nside it's just sad when nothing happens you know they bite at you with their big jaws\n\n01:34:42.160 --> 01:34:47.320\nbut I guess even though this is potentially their true form they're not really agile and\n\n01:34:47.320 --> 01:34:52.720\nyou find it easy to dodge out of their snapping mouths damn Carlos I'm feeling so confident\n\n01:34:52.720 --> 01:35:02.400\nright now I'm feeling really really hot I'm some hot diarrhea right now so hot I pull\n\n01:35:02.400 --> 01:35:08.200\nout of another

01:37:27.640\nit with your sword and then your shield the sword hits the shield doesn't do damage because\n\n01:37:27.640 --> 01:37:32.760\nit's like a shield you smack it but it doesn't seem very bothered by it but your sword hits\n\n01:37:32.760 --> 01:37:41.200\nthe other one for three three six damage three six no six six damage it takes six damage\n\n01:37:41.200 --> 01:37:47.960\nand it's
