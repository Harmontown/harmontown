WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:18.440
From Hollywood, California, Meltdown Comics, The Nerdist Theater, Carmen Town is now at

00:18.440 --> 00:45.200
the end of the season.

00:45.200 --> 01:10.320
Thank you for coming to the show I'm doing.

01:10.320 --> 01:18.960
All right, so yeah, my therapist, she recommended a book for me and then she didn't tell me,

01:18.960 --> 01:22.480
she just told me the title and then I got it and then the guy started talking and it's

01:22.480 --> 01:23.480
an ADD book.

01:23.480 --> 01:27.680
I think I might be in the verge of a diagnosis.

01:27.680 --> 01:30.320
But she didn't want to, you could tell because I was like, you want to recommend any other

01:30.320 --> 01:31.320
books?

01:31.320 --> 01:32.920
And she's like, just let me know how this one goes.

01:32.920 --> 01:38.640
But I think like she's very begrudging like, because you know, I'm a self-diagnoser, right?

01:38.640 --> 01:41.320
I think she like wanted to put the kibosh on that right away.

01:41.320 --> 01:43.160
She's like, you're not fucking autistic.

01:43.160 --> 01:44.160
You poser.

01:44.160 --> 01:51.080
And I am and I'm from like, like it's hard to pay attention to this book about ADD.

01:51.080 --> 01:57.040
It's hard to, it literally honestly looks like it's not even a joke because the guy

01:57.040 --> 02:01.360
that wrote it as ADD and he's a doctor that diagnoses it, which makes you think like, wait,

02:01.360 --> 02:02.920
is this like the stuff with Garrett Morris?

02:02.920 --> 02:04.840
Is it just a thing that like spreads?

02:04.840 --> 02:12.400
He's looking up the blob like, like, like, but, but the, the, but just I got to calm

02:12.400 --> 02:13.400
down because here's the thing.

02:13.400 --> 02:14.400
Okay.

02:14.400 --> 02:18.600
The beginning of the book, it even went, so, hey, how's it going?

02:18.600 --> 02:25.560
Hey guys, the beginning of the book went so far as to say ADD people have a hard time

02:25.560 --> 02:29.920
finishing books and this book was made with that in mind.

02:29.920 --> 02:35.840
But with that in mind, they did not go that extra mile to make it accessible to ADD people.

02:35.840 --> 02:38.040
I don't think it was very slow paced.

02:38.040 --> 02:42.840
Well, there's like a great way to get away with writing a shitty book.

02:42.840 --> 02:47.440
There's two, there's two versions of the book that when I look on audio books, it's called

02:47.440 --> 02:54.120
driven to distraction or not driven to distraction delivered from distraction.

02:54.120 --> 02:57.400
The former is like a Harlequin romance novel.

02:57.400 --> 03:04.000
If you get the name of your ADD book wrong, you might have ADD.

03:04.000 --> 03:07.040
But there's a, there's two versions and there were the slightly different colored cover

03:07.040 --> 03:10.200
and one is three hours and one is 12 hours.

03:10.200 --> 03:14.880
And then I, I could only get the three hour one in because I wasn't on Wi-Fi.

03:14.880 --> 03:20.640
And then he begins, he says like, this is the three hour version because you have ADD.

03:20.640 --> 03:23.880
But then also in addition to that, very boring, very boring book.

03:23.880 --> 03:24.880
Yeah.

03:24.880 --> 03:27.760
And you're an Adderall user, enthusiast.

03:27.760 --> 03:35.200
And I thought, illegitimately, but imagine my surprise to find out I'm on medication.

03:35.200 --> 03:41.840
But the people I know that actually have that are diagnosed with ADD or ADHD that, and they

03:41.840 --> 03:48.000
take Adderall, they don't get like a beat that actually just restores their memory.

03:48.000 --> 03:52.320
Having listened to 15 minutes of this 12 hour audio book, I can tell you there's a lot of

03:52.320 --> 03:53.320
misconceptions.

03:53.320 --> 03:56.000
First of all, it's a, it's everybody's different.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
That's what you'll hear about.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
Everything.

03:58.000 --> 04:02.400
It's like, it should be called attention fluctuation disorder if it was going to be like named

04:02.400 --> 04:05.400
in a way that would help you like this.

04:05.400 --> 04:08.400
People have hyper focus that have ADD.

04:08.400 --> 04:13.400
People have, are easily distracted like, like, like, like, you know, they're just scattered.

04:13.400 --> 04:17.360
They're just, you just, it's like, it's kind of, you know, it's, it's all over the place.

04:17.360 --> 04:21.840
You have hyper empathy, you have, you're, it, there's just a lot of overlap with things

04:21.840 --> 04:25.880
that you could see, like you could diagnose somebody being bipolar, like a lot of their,

04:25.880 --> 04:31.520
a lot of the things like you can both bipolar people and ADD people, they, you, you, they

04:31.520 --> 04:36.320
could behave feel identically in certain situations.

04:36.320 --> 04:40.280
Like at certain times you'd be like, oh, that person's bipolar or vice, or ADD and you could

04:40.280 --> 04:45.160
be, it could be the other thing because like both of those categories, you could, in spite

04:45.160 --> 04:52.360
of all outward empirical evidence that you've, you're doing fine, you could feel like you're

04:52.360 --> 04:56.000
a piece of shit and you need to just eat a bucket of shit and jump off a roof.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.320
Like ADD people can feel that way.

04:58.320 --> 05:01.000
And then the other thing that I thought was really valuable to know, which I should have

05:01.000 --> 05:04.040
just Googled in the first place, because you just, you always sit around and ask this stuff

05:04.040 --> 05:07.280
and you never look it up, ADHD versus ADD.

05:07.280 --> 05:13.040
It's not, it's not like ADD and then you add an H, they changed the name.

05:13.040 --> 05:15.020
They changed the name to ADHD.

05:15.020 --> 05:19.720
You can have a form of ADHD in which you're not hyperactive.

05:19.720 --> 05:24.120
It's called ADHD minus the H. They don't call it ADD.

05:24.120 --> 05:25.320
They changed the name.

05:25.320 --> 05:26.320
There's some clinicians that continue to do it.

05:26.320 --> 05:29.000
The new DSM changed it a lot.

05:29.000 --> 05:33.240
That's why autism is, or no, that's why Asperger's is now just part of autism.

05:33.240 --> 05:34.240
It's like the same.

05:34.240 --> 05:35.240
Yeah.

05:35.240 --> 05:36.240
It's exciting stuff.

05:36.240 --> 05:38.760
It's super exciting, super exciting stuff.

05:38.760 --> 05:41.880
What do you think your, your hyper thing is?

05:41.880 --> 05:43.520
What do you hyper about?

05:43.520 --> 05:44.520
Oh, I don't know.

05:44.520 --> 05:49.760
Well, I was, look, I don't, I don't got nothing until somebody tells me I do.

05:49.760 --> 05:52.160
But, but you, but you want it though.

05:52.160 --> 05:53.360
You're excited about a diagnosis.

05:53.360 --> 05:59.480
No, I want, I want cheap Adderall and I got that because I told the pharmacist from Yelp

05:59.480 --> 06:01.760
that I had trouble watching movies or something.

06:01.760 --> 06:03.280
I don't remember what he asked.

06:03.280 --> 06:06.640
He asked three questions and said, you definitely have ADD, which I know you're never supposed

06:06.640 --> 06:09.280
to say you definitely have anything as a doctor.

06:09.280 --> 06:15.800
So, but he, I found him on Yelp, but I, what, what, what I have, okay, here's some things

06:15.800 --> 06:20.880
that I have that I'm, I'd be relieved to learn were symptomatic.

06:20.880 --> 06:24.800
I have a very, very, and, and, and not because they would excuse the behavior because they

06:24.800 --> 06:28.080
would help me, they would empower me to go like, I got to work on that.

06:28.080 --> 06:32.200
You know, it's a, I just have a really hard time being interrupted.

06:32.200 --> 06:35.640
You may notice that sometimes I snap at you a little bit if I'm in the middle of like a

06:35.640 --> 06:36.640
point or something.

06:36.640 --> 06:37.640
It reminds me of the story.

06:37.640 --> 06:41.200
Like, fuck, I'm trying to talk.

06:41.200 --> 06:42.200
Easy, easy joke.

06:42.200 --> 06:46.240
We rehearsed that backstage.

06:46.240 --> 06:52.080
But if I could be in the middle of a tweet, like a fucking dumb observation that Trump

06:52.080 --> 06:56.560
is a dick or something like, and, and, and my girlfriend could come over and I'm like,

06:56.560 --> 06:57.560
I'm tweeting.

06:57.560 --> 07:00.600
I'm in the middle of a tweet and I'm like trying to reword like, or I could be in the

07:00.600 --> 07:05.160
middle of a thought or let alone like, then you bring like addictive things like Minecraft

07:05.160 --> 07:08.040
or something into that, like, or if I'm in the middle of a train of thought, even though

07:08.040 --> 07:11.320
I just ramble, I don't have, I don't have a right to be upset when people interrupt

07:11.320 --> 07:12.320
me.

07:12.320 --> 07:14.320
I would never stop talking if nobody interrupted me.

07:14.320 --> 07:19.040
But interruption is like, I have a harder, I get distracted and I'll either go like,

07:19.040 --> 07:23.680
wait, what, what, what, like, you know, like, like, like, or, or I'll, I'll like pretend

07:23.680 --> 07:24.680
I'm listening.

07:24.680 --> 07:28.440
I'm like, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, and I'll be burping while I'm talking and, and the

07:28.440 --> 07:32.480
person will think I'm listening to them and I'm not, you know, it's a kind of like a hyper

07:32.480 --> 07:37.120
focus is what that is, I think, and like, so knowing that you have that, you go like,

07:37.120 --> 07:40.520
okay, I'm going to work on that, you know, and there's like things I'm excited to learn

07:40.520 --> 07:44.000
about called like a interactive metronome or something like that.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
I don't know.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.720
It sounds like some kind of sounds fun.

07:48.720 --> 07:49.720
There's like treatments.

07:49.720 --> 07:54.000
You can treat yourself, you know, I think everybody should, if when we go to the moon,

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
we should all treat ourselves.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
Here's what we're going to do.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.120
We're going to treat ourselves in both sense of the words.

07:58.120 --> 08:02.440
We're going to all, everyone, everyone's personality is going to be a disease.

08:02.440 --> 08:05.720
You, you, you, what's your name, sir?

08:05.720 --> 08:06.720
Tom.

08:06.720 --> 08:07.720
Tom, you have Tomism.

08:07.720 --> 08:14.400
You, you are, you have, you have hyper Tom disorder or, or, or, or, or inappropriate

08:14.400 --> 08:19.240
Tom, Tom disorder, like, you, you, you, you are Tom, but that doesn't mean you get to

08:19.240 --> 08:24.320
just run around barfing on people and going, oh, but Tom, that's how Tom rolls.

08:24.320 --> 08:27.720
It's an invitation for other people to accept who you are.

08:27.720 --> 08:28.720
Oh, that's Tom.

08:28.720 --> 08:34.000
He has Tomism, and then also the other side is you got to be, they're going to do that

08:34.000 --> 08:37.400
because they think that when you go home, you're like, you, you owe it to them to be

08:37.400 --> 08:42.600
like, fucking, fucking Tomism, I got to work on this shit until I'm, until I'm like, I

08:42.600 --> 08:43.600
don't know.

08:43.600 --> 08:45.600
What do you think of the noticeable symptoms of Tomism?

08:45.600 --> 08:57.360
Uh, do they polite smirk, you know, uh, we, we, we, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

08:57.360 --> 09:05.200
futuristic members only, uh, windbreaker and, uh, general handsomeness and, uh, uh, latent

09:05.200 --> 09:09.200
hoodie, latent, latent hoodie, uh, tendencies.

09:09.200 --> 09:10.200
Yeah.

09:10.200 --> 09:15.360
Not, not sure if there's a hood or not, uh, could, could just be, uh, doing equipment

09:15.360 --> 09:16.360
back there.

09:16.360 --> 09:17.360
Yeah.

09:17.360 --> 09:18.360
Okay.

09:18.360 --> 09:19.360
What am I?

09:19.360 --> 09:20.360
What am I?

09:20.360 --> 09:21.360
An insult comic?

09:21.360 --> 09:22.360
I'm going to make fun of you.

09:22.360 --> 09:25.360
You called, you called his name a disease.

09:25.360 --> 09:26.360
You know what I was doing.

09:26.360 --> 09:27.360
I know.

09:27.360 --> 09:32.360
It was, it was, what I was doing was beautiful.

09:32.360 --> 09:33.360
It's a beautiful idea.

09:33.360 --> 09:36.040
Everyone's, you know, and this is another thing.

09:36.040 --> 09:40.520
Now I know whenever I share beautiful things with you guys and I sense that you guys don't

09:40.520 --> 09:43.520
appreciate me enough, it's just the disease.

09:43.520 --> 09:46.440
It's you guys aren't assholes.

09:46.440 --> 09:49.880
I used to think, I used to think I was a piece of shit and that you guys are making me feel

09:49.880 --> 09:50.880
that way.

09:50.880 --> 09:55.520
And then like, like I would go home and I'd go, that audience, I love them, but we got

09:55.520 --> 09:58.120
to, we got to figure this shit out.

09:58.120 --> 09:59.880
But now I know it's just all in my head.

09:59.880 --> 10:01.520
Like you're just a bunch of people sitting around.

10:01.520 --> 10:02.520
Who knows what you're thinking.

10:02.520 --> 10:04.520
They're all just, they all have diseases.

10:04.520 --> 10:05.520
Yeah.

10:05.520 --> 10:06.520
Yeah.

10:06.520 --> 10:11.280
You're, you're Mary, Mary, Mary, Maryitis and Ralphists.

10:11.280 --> 10:17.400
Let's, let's put the, let's put, let's put the pressure of entertainment tonight on

10:17.400 --> 10:18.880
some, on some wonderful guests.

10:18.880 --> 10:19.880
Huh?

10:19.880 --> 10:20.880
Who do we got?

10:20.880 --> 10:21.880
Oh God.

10:21.880 --> 10:22.880
Damn it.

10:22.880 --> 10:23.880
I don't know their human names.

10:23.880 --> 10:24.880
I only know where they're from.

10:24.880 --> 10:25.880
Oh, Sarah and Beth.

10:25.880 --> 10:27.920
I am talking about Sarah and Beth.

10:27.920 --> 10:28.920
Okay.

10:28.920 --> 10:29.920
Do you know where they're from?

10:29.920 --> 10:36.720
They're from a really celebrated, a hot, awesome web site.

10:36.720 --> 10:44.080
But shouldn't we know their last names, should we introduce them with, by their last names

10:44.080 --> 10:45.080
too before we say?

10:45.080 --> 10:47.080
I think that would only be professional, yes.

10:47.080 --> 10:48.080
But I don't have them.

10:48.080 --> 10:49.080
So where did you do that?

10:49.080 --> 10:50.080
Hold on.

10:50.080 --> 10:51.080
I'm just going to pull up.

10:51.080 --> 10:52.080
Let's get it.

10:52.080 --> 10:53.080
Okay.

10:53.080 --> 10:54.080
Here we go.

10:54.080 --> 10:55.080
No, I don't.

10:55.080 --> 10:56.080
I don't know.

10:56.080 --> 10:59.080
I'm going to be honest because I have ADD and I have, like, don't worry about me.

10:59.080 --> 11:05.080
Folks, please welcome Beth Newell and Sarah Popolardo from Reductress.

11:05.080 --> 11:10.080
All right.

11:10.080 --> 11:12.080
Yeah.

11:12.080 --> 11:20.840
So, so, uh, all right.

11:20.840 --> 11:24.440
So, Reductress is a, do you want us to say it?

11:24.440 --> 11:25.440
Yeah.

11:25.440 --> 11:26.440
No, no, no.

11:26.440 --> 11:27.440
Let me take a shot.

11:27.440 --> 11:28.440
It'll be funny.

11:28.440 --> 11:29.440
Okay.

11:29.440 --> 11:30.440
Yeah.

11:30.440 --> 11:40.400
Reductress is a parody satirical web news site with a feminist point of view, but it

11:40.400 --> 11:44.160
could be satirizing both the feminist point of view and the world around us.

11:44.160 --> 11:45.160
It's, you know?

11:45.160 --> 11:46.160
Yeah.

11:46.160 --> 11:48.720
I would say that's like, that's an A minus.

11:48.720 --> 11:49.720
That's good.

11:49.720 --> 11:50.720
That's good.

11:50.720 --> 11:51.720
Yeah.

11:51.720 --> 11:54.400
In a world where there's such a thing as web news and we're all getting our news from

11:54.400 --> 11:57.240
the web, and I don't know why Clickhole is not more popular, like it's one of the old

11:57.240 --> 12:03.320
few, like, like, like attempts in a post newspaper world where we all recognize that the onion

12:03.320 --> 12:05.680
was doing something important.

12:05.680 --> 12:11.600
And then the web became like this horrible cesspool and comedy seemed to just, like,

12:11.600 --> 12:16.000
that onion instinct seemed to just go like, like, like, or maybe there's not enough demand

12:16.000 --> 12:22.400
for it, like the Clickhole should be, it should be more powerful, people should be constantly

12:22.400 --> 12:26.240
like, oh, I'm so happy that someone's pointing out how Clickhole is pointing out how we're

12:26.240 --> 12:27.240
all fucked.

12:27.240 --> 12:28.240
Yeah.

12:28.240 --> 12:32.720
I don't think, I don't think most of the world knows how fucked up the internet is yet.

12:32.720 --> 12:35.720
So they don't even understand what Clickhole is doing.

12:35.720 --> 12:37.520
It's really hard to satirize garbage.

12:37.520 --> 12:38.520
Yeah.

12:38.520 --> 12:39.520
Yeah.

12:39.520 --> 12:40.520
It parenties itself.

12:40.520 --> 12:43.280
Are you guys, you guys seem like you're probably a little younger than me.

12:43.280 --> 12:50.520
I don't see any, I'm not going to objectify you, but you, you seem smooth and, uh...

12:50.520 --> 12:51.520
Thank you.

12:51.520 --> 12:56.440
Dan, Dan, they are certainly younger than you.

12:56.440 --> 12:57.440
Do you have opinions?

12:57.440 --> 12:59.440
Do you think that it's, it's hot?

12:59.440 --> 13:00.440
No.

13:00.440 --> 13:01.440
As a woman?

13:01.440 --> 13:02.440
No.

13:02.440 --> 13:05.440
No, absolutely not.

13:05.440 --> 13:07.880
Do young women still have opinions?

13:07.880 --> 13:14.040
Do you have opinions about generational stuff versus like, uh, relationship with irony?

13:14.040 --> 13:19.200
Do you think, like, I'm 44, I've sat up here a lot and said, like, I don't think the kids

13:19.200 --> 13:21.440
are, I don't think they get irony as much.

13:21.440 --> 13:22.440
Oh, really?

13:22.440 --> 13:26.080
Because when we talk to our parents, we're like, we don't think they get what we're doing.

13:26.080 --> 13:27.080
Yeah.

13:27.080 --> 13:28.080
Yeah.

13:28.080 --> 13:29.080
No, they don't see irony at all.

13:29.080 --> 13:31.400
But everyone thought that irony was dead when Obama got elected.

13:31.400 --> 13:33.080
I don't think it went anywhere.

13:33.080 --> 13:35.080
We still have it.

13:35.080 --> 13:36.080
Right.

13:36.080 --> 13:38.520
So, is it, is it, I mean, do you guys tweet and stuff?

13:38.520 --> 13:39.520
Do you ever tweet bits?

13:39.520 --> 13:40.520
Yeah.

13:40.520 --> 13:41.520
Yeah.

13:41.520 --> 13:44.360
Do you, do you find, like, like, then people tweet back, like, if you tweeted, like, I'm

13:44.360 --> 13:46.080
trying to think of a, just a simple example.

13:46.080 --> 13:50.200
Oh, like, you make a joke that's a question and someone answers the question as they want

13:50.200 --> 13:51.200
it.

13:51.200 --> 13:53.080
Or you make a joke that's like pointing out, you're like, boy, I can't believe Tom Cruise

13:53.080 --> 13:54.080
didn't do this.

13:54.080 --> 13:57.080
And then someone will, it's going to go like, well, that's because he's a celebrity.

13:57.080 --> 13:58.080
Yeah.

13:58.080 --> 14:02.280
And, and, and, or, or, or, or they'll kind of like, they'll just repeat your joke.

14:02.280 --> 14:03.280
Yeah.

14:03.280 --> 14:05.440
They'll be like, for that matter, I can't believe Tom Cruise didn't do that.

14:05.440 --> 14:07.760
And it'll be like, that was my bit, you dig?

14:07.760 --> 14:12.200
That's when, that's when I wonder if they're actually more ironically detached than me.

14:12.200 --> 14:15.760
Like they're doing a bit that's just more irritating than my bit.

14:15.760 --> 14:20.160
I would say what you're talking about women and minorities get at like times 10 on Twitter

14:20.160 --> 14:23.200
because people are just like, I don't think they know what they're saying.

14:23.200 --> 14:24.720
Let me explain it to them.

14:24.720 --> 14:25.720
Oh yeah.

14:25.720 --> 14:29.040
Well, also there's the whole thing of, and I promise I'm not white knighting by saying

14:29.040 --> 14:30.760
this, I think this is fucking fascinating.

14:30.760 --> 14:36.440
I just, we spend half of our time saying, wanting to debate whether women are funny.

14:36.440 --> 14:41.280
And then the other half of the time when women, the funny women who like therefore say things

14:41.280 --> 14:46.160
that are crazy, sometimes that are a little inappropriate, we fuck it like, come on.

14:46.160 --> 14:50.520
We clamp down on them like harder than any dude, right?

14:50.520 --> 14:55.680
I mean, you're biased, probably you're women, but you, but you noticed that, right?

14:55.680 --> 15:00.600
Like, like the, the, the, but is it, do you get, okay, here's, here's a question.

15:00.600 --> 15:07.360
Now, as, as women that are doing comedy, are you guys of the camp of like, oh, suck it

15:07.360 --> 15:11.520
up, buttercup, because we want to be judged on how funny we are, or are you of the camp

15:11.520 --> 15:17.680
of like, Jesus Christ, people need to realize that the perception is all out of whack.

15:17.680 --> 15:18.680
I don't want to give you that choice.

15:18.680 --> 15:19.680
Why is there a dichotomy?

15:19.680 --> 15:21.680
The second choice?

15:21.680 --> 15:23.760
I would say it's a little bit of both.

15:23.760 --> 15:30.040
Like on the one hand, I don't want to be judged because like, oh, I'm a woman, like, like my,

15:30.040 --> 15:34.680
my work, because I'm a woman, I want to be judged for what I actually make.

15:34.680 --> 15:38.400
But at the same time, it is fucking hard for women to do this, because it always becomes

15:38.400 --> 15:40.320
about like, how did you do it?

15:40.320 --> 15:45.920
Like you don't see male comedians memoirs, the way that you see like Amy Schumer and

15:45.920 --> 15:49.840
everyone, because everyone's just like, way more obsessed with how did they do it?

15:49.840 --> 15:53.240
Like, how did they claw their way out of that womanly pile of garbage?

15:53.240 --> 15:54.240
Well, for sure.

15:54.240 --> 15:57.920
Jim Belushi, like, wrote a book and said that when he was six years old, he put, he found

15:57.920 --> 16:02.680
a, a, a piece of gravel up his little brother's ass, like, like, that wouldn't be coming up

16:02.680 --> 16:06.520
over and over again and every critique of everything he said on the internet.

16:06.520 --> 16:10.360
Plus you, you're an incestuous pedophile, you found gravel up your little brother's

16:10.360 --> 16:11.360
butt.

16:11.360 --> 16:12.360
It'd be like, no, it's Jim Belushi.

16:12.360 --> 16:13.360
It's his book.

16:13.360 --> 16:14.360
He probably didn't even write it.

16:14.360 --> 16:19.760
And like, like, like, like, like, like, I'd say other than Lena Dunham is a, is a tremendously

16:19.760 --> 16:21.480
entertaining person to me.

16:21.480 --> 16:23.160
She's like, like, she's not a senator.

16:23.160 --> 16:26.040
She doesn't, she doesn't, she's not going to say shit that's like, whatever, why, I'm

16:26.040 --> 16:29.920
not trying to kiss your ass, I'm not, I don't view you as being part of a biomass with Lena

16:29.920 --> 16:30.920
Dunham.

16:30.920 --> 16:31.920
Trying to put rocks in my ass.

16:31.920 --> 16:32.920
Come on.

16:32.920 --> 16:33.920
Come on, Harmon.

16:33.920 --> 16:34.920
Get your shit together.

16:34.920 --> 16:35.920
Get your shit.

16:35.920 --> 16:40.200
You got, you got 20 minutes left to prove to these women that you're a feminist.

16:40.200 --> 16:41.200
The meter is running.

16:41.200 --> 16:42.200
You're waiting.

16:42.200 --> 16:43.200
Tick-tock.

16:43.200 --> 16:49.960
Now, I'm kind of like, like, like in a more general sense, pulling, pulling, pulling back

16:49.960 --> 16:56.480
to just doing your, your, your, your, on a website, your parodying a cesspool, which

16:56.480 --> 16:58.680
parodies itself.

16:58.680 --> 17:02.720
Do you guys have any, are you guys like the head honchos at Reductress?

17:02.720 --> 17:03.720
Yeah.

17:03.720 --> 17:06.240
So do you guys, and did you, you, you started it as partners?

17:06.240 --> 17:07.240
Yeah.

17:07.240 --> 17:08.240
You just said, let's fucking do this.

17:08.240 --> 17:09.880
Did you have to seek out investors?

17:09.880 --> 17:13.040
I just got distracted by a whole line of questioning, but go with it.

17:13.040 --> 17:14.040
We've been bootstrapping.

17:14.040 --> 17:15.040
Yeah.

17:15.040 --> 17:17.520
So we've just been like doing it hand to mouth for a few years.

17:17.520 --> 17:19.360
Do you monetize?

17:19.360 --> 17:20.360
We do monetize.

17:20.360 --> 17:24.680
I don't know if you noticed though, the internet is a shit place to make money, so we make

17:24.680 --> 17:29.520
money doing other stuff, like events and, uh, uh, podcast as well, and, and more.

17:29.520 --> 17:31.520
But you saw advertising and stuff?

17:31.520 --> 17:32.520
Yeah.

17:32.520 --> 17:33.520
Uh, the, the, okay.

17:33.520 --> 17:37.240
So now, getting back to, so when you sat down and said, this is worth trying, it's going

17:37.240 --> 17:39.200
to be brutal because there's no way to monetize it.

17:39.200 --> 17:40.200
It's going to fucking suck.

17:40.200 --> 17:41.200
Uphill battle.

17:41.200 --> 17:47.280
Do you have a, did you, do you have like a, a comedic commission statement that makes

17:47.280 --> 17:48.280
sense?

17:48.280 --> 17:49.280
Is that a question?

17:49.280 --> 17:50.280
Is that a comedic?

17:50.280 --> 17:54.400
Uh, mission statement was mostly just like women's media sucks and it doesn't represent

17:54.400 --> 17:57.520
us and we're smarter than this.

17:57.520 --> 18:02.360
Talk about the landscape unless it's going to get you in trouble, uh, like express that

18:02.360 --> 18:03.360
frustration.

18:03.360 --> 18:07.880
Like, like when you look at the, the pre-reductors landscape of women's comedy, like what do

18:07.880 --> 18:09.880
you see the sins being?

18:09.880 --> 18:15.080
I mean, I think the big one was the way that women's, women's magazines talk down to women

18:15.080 --> 18:19.600
and use fear and insecurity to make them buy things ultimately.

18:19.600 --> 18:25.240
And then later on we started seeing empowerment marketing, like the dove ads, also, uh, using

18:25.240 --> 18:28.400
empowerment and feminism in order to sell things.

18:28.400 --> 18:30.480
So it basically all revolves around that.

18:30.480 --> 18:35.480
What are examples of that that we're not the, the, just like, like what woke me up more

18:35.480 --> 18:41.000
like, like, if I see a thing and I'm a guy and I see something and it's like, uh, high

18:41.000 --> 18:46.880
five this woman for doing this or like, like, I often, sometimes I see things and I think

18:46.880 --> 18:50.280
in the back of my head, I'm like, I'm like, that's fucking dumb.

18:50.280 --> 18:54.800
Like, like, like, if I were a woman that would make me mad, but then I don't know if it would

18:54.800 --> 18:55.800
make you mad.

18:55.800 --> 18:56.800
It definitely does.

18:56.800 --> 18:59.960
I think that part of the frustration was a lot of men see that and they're like, they

18:59.960 --> 19:01.400
don't think that thing's dumb.

19:01.400 --> 19:03.880
They think women are dumb and like that thing.

19:03.880 --> 19:04.960
That's the fucking, okay.

19:04.960 --> 19:07.840
So we were trying to point that out like, we're like, we don't want this.

19:07.840 --> 19:08.840
Yeah.

19:08.840 --> 19:09.840
We're not in charge of the internet.

19:09.840 --> 19:10.840
That's really that.

19:10.840 --> 19:11.840
That's really blowing my mind.

19:11.840 --> 19:14.040
I never, that's true.

19:14.040 --> 19:15.280
I think, but that's true.

19:15.280 --> 19:20.360
Like you have a tendency to, because we have, we have preconceived like investments emotionally.

19:20.360 --> 19:24.600
We definitely found that out like, like, like that we, no matter who we are, that we had

19:24.600 --> 19:29.440
like, we had stacks of poker chips in this game that we did not, no one ever made us

19:29.440 --> 19:30.440
count.

19:30.440 --> 19:37.520
We were like, so if somebody says, look at this body positive, uh, uh, parade marshal,

19:37.520 --> 19:40.680
uh, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like,

19:40.680 --> 19:42.560
like, episode title.

19:42.560 --> 19:47.920
You're like, you're like, click.

19:47.920 --> 19:51.600
There's things that they, they, they, they're trying to get clicks in those like, so you're

19:51.600 --> 19:55.680
clicking the turnstile that's created, like includes these like attitudes.

19:55.680 --> 20:01.840
So you can say, Charlie Sheen just started a new massage parlor and you're like, okay,

20:01.840 --> 20:06.160
you're only clicking on it if that interests you and it only interests you if a, you're

20:06.160 --> 20:10.080
a big Charlie Sheen fan or a big fan of massage, or if Charlie Sheen's a clown, do you want

20:10.080 --> 20:14.360
to like really, really like get some shit off your chest in the comment section?

20:14.360 --> 20:19.880
And so like the stuff that has to do with women, like it, but like that Charlie Sheen

20:19.880 --> 20:24.360
thing I never think in my head, oh, why is Charlie Sheen making me try to, you know,

20:24.360 --> 20:28.720
why does he want me to think things about him other than he's into massage and is a

20:28.720 --> 20:29.720
good businessman?

20:29.720 --> 20:32.560
I'm going to go disabuse him of that notion.

20:32.560 --> 20:40.680
But if somebody tweets like, oh, Amy Schumer's new music video does this and that, and it's

20:40.680 --> 20:44.080
not, she doesn't get to be in charge of how her joke is being delivered.

20:44.080 --> 20:49.160
And then you go, and you go, I'm going to let this bitch know that women aren't funny.

20:49.160 --> 20:50.160
Thank you.

20:50.160 --> 21:02.120
Yeah, I mean, I, we'll be right back.

21:02.120 --> 21:17.120
I guess I kind of acted like I was teeing you guys up to say something.

21:17.120 --> 21:21.880
No, I mean, I think, I mean, it's interesting because it seems like, you know, Charlie Sheen

21:21.880 --> 21:28.120
amid all of his flaws just exists, like he is objectively existing and yet a woman is

21:28.120 --> 21:33.440
just a thing to place all of your, project all of your fears, insecurities and anger

21:33.440 --> 21:34.440
on too.

21:34.440 --> 21:38.640
Like I don't, it's just seems like it's all our job to have opinions about women, but

21:38.640 --> 21:40.800
it just doesn't work the same way for men.

21:40.800 --> 21:46.440
Do you think that that's not to set you up to sound like a, like, I don't know, not

21:46.440 --> 21:52.840
to set you up to sound anyway, but, but do you think that that is localized culturally,

21:52.840 --> 21:59.360
like chronologically, or do you think that that is like a weird, like, like crazy primate

21:59.360 --> 22:05.560
condition that the, that, that women are scary to men and kind of like, like, and maybe

22:05.560 --> 22:06.560
scary to each other.

22:06.560 --> 22:10.120
And like, there's like this weird flow of energy in that direction.

22:10.120 --> 22:14.640
I think we've been conditioned by media to like fear women, especially if they're in

22:14.640 --> 22:16.440
a position of power.

22:16.440 --> 22:19.960
So like that's all the media we've seen where we see a woman in charge.

22:19.960 --> 22:23.960
She's like a horrible boss and she sucks.

22:23.960 --> 22:26.240
And there's just like no examples out there.

22:26.240 --> 22:30.200
Cause I think with Charlie Sheen, like he can be this garbage mess of a person.

22:30.200 --> 22:31.200
But we love him.

22:31.200 --> 22:32.200
And he, we love him.

22:32.200 --> 22:35.760
And then in five years we could say he like fixed all his problems and people would forgive

22:35.760 --> 22:40.040
him and he'd make a new movie and there'd be some like redemption story.

22:40.040 --> 22:43.440
But if a woman did that, we would always be like, she's a garbage pile.

22:43.440 --> 22:47.680
It's just Lindsay Lohan and then like, she just never comes back and it's sad.

22:47.680 --> 22:48.680
There is a, yeah.

22:48.680 --> 22:52.760
Like I, I can look at myself and feel that like I, like from my twenties, like before

22:52.760 --> 22:59.720
I started like examining that stuff, maybe I like, like it, it's, you're punching down

22:59.720 --> 23:02.880
before you know, you're punching down, like you, because you think you're punching up

23:02.880 --> 23:08.360
because you're a guy and, and like women are just like, they're just important and, and

23:08.360 --> 23:09.960
they didn't buy a ticket to that ride.

23:09.960 --> 23:14.440
And they're also not all the same thing, but to you they are because of your situation

23:14.440 --> 23:20.280
as that combined with, with, with privilege equals like the situation where it's like

23:20.280 --> 23:22.200
you can't get out of the starting gate.

23:22.200 --> 23:25.000
If you were to say, I'm going to be a woman and I'm going to be funny in this way.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.760
And it's like, yeah, why am I explaining this shit to you?

23:27.760 --> 23:33.400
I've only, there was a word for me explaining it to you that.

23:33.400 --> 23:35.000
It does feel like punching up though.

23:35.000 --> 23:39.200
I think when you're taking down a person who's in such a high level of power, like Lena Dunham

23:39.200 --> 23:41.240
and Amy Schumer, they're like so successful.

23:41.240 --> 23:45.160
You're like, I can make fun of them, but then at the same time you're like, as women, it's

23:45.160 --> 23:46.960
like we only got two this year.

23:46.960 --> 23:50.800
You know, like it's like you guys had a lot of, you know, so you're like, oh, you're taking

23:50.800 --> 23:52.440
down our one person.

23:52.440 --> 23:53.440
You know,

23:53.440 --> 24:00.040
I was, I was, I was, I think this is related, I swear to God, I was watching a documentary

24:00.040 --> 24:06.000
about sex dolls and sex robots.

24:06.000 --> 24:10.240
Hear them out, hear them out.

24:10.240 --> 24:11.240
There's a couple of these.

24:11.240 --> 24:13.760
There's a documentary about guys who have their sex dolls.

24:13.760 --> 24:19.080
This was the thing about guys who are dedicated to the dream of inventing sex dolls, the guys

24:19.080 --> 24:21.960
who are engineering them, and the guys who can't wait to be their first customer.

24:21.960 --> 24:23.520
I think I saw that one.

24:23.520 --> 24:28.120
And the thing that I think, I hope I can articulate this with, but, but, because I, I feel like

24:28.120 --> 24:33.960
I noticed this is that like every, even despite the fact that these guys are in their garage,

24:33.960 --> 24:37.360
like making sex dolls, and then the other guys are like, I can't wait to have a sex

24:37.360 --> 24:38.360
robot.

24:38.360 --> 24:43.560
Um, uh, they, when they get to, they, when they grace the topics of like, uh, just sex

24:43.560 --> 24:47.640
in general, even though they're supposed to be deconstructing it with, with pride and

24:47.640 --> 24:54.240
with a lawn, they still go like, you know, as the pelvic thrusts for certain other activities,

24:54.240 --> 24:55.240
if you know what I mean.

24:55.240 --> 24:59.280
Um, and I was like, what do you mean if I know what you mean, this whole thing, there's

24:59.280 --> 25:05.520
a camera crew in your garage, you're making a dickpiston, like that's like, uh, why, just,

25:05.520 --> 25:07.120
just talk like it's NASCAR.

25:07.120 --> 25:11.680
And here's the thing, like, like the, the guys that are waiting for the sex robots who

25:11.680 --> 25:15.240
also talk like that, they go like, like, like, oh, and I'm looking for a certain thing.

25:15.240 --> 25:16.240
If you know what I mean.

25:16.240 --> 25:21.800
And like kind of like for certain visceral topics that wouldn't by nature be offensive,

25:21.800 --> 25:26.800
they like the, the guys that are inventing the sex robots by, by virtue of the fact that

25:26.800 --> 25:31.880
they're making them in their garage and it's hard to make beautiful, uh, things, um, by

25:31.880 --> 25:40.480
scratch, uh, with lumber and nails, um, the, the fucking apple to E have ripped sex robots.

25:40.480 --> 25:41.480
Yeah.

25:41.480 --> 25:46.640
It's like the city to the extent that the sex robots are able to, for instance, move

25:46.640 --> 25:52.960
or talk, all of that budget in your Sim city of like what makes a sex robot, it all goes

25:52.960 --> 25:57.680
away from like physical attractiveness, kind of like it's hard to like, it's already hard

25:57.680 --> 26:01.800
to make a, a thing that looks like a beautiful human being in the first place.

26:01.800 --> 26:05.200
And then these guys are trying to make a thing that like acts right and talks right and goes

26:05.200 --> 26:06.360
like this.

26:06.360 --> 26:11.040
And so, and so, but what I noticed for that reason is that then they would go to these,

26:11.040 --> 26:16.040
these guys who are connoisseurs and pay it forward to connoisseurs of sex robots that

26:16.040 --> 26:21.480
don't exist yet and, and all of them as they intercut between them talking about this guy's

26:21.480 --> 26:25.120
new sex robot, he's like, I'm in, I'm unveiling the sex robot and it just looks like David

26:25.120 --> 26:26.120
Lee Roth.

26:26.120 --> 26:30.040
And he's like, because he's focused on all this other functionality and the thing just

26:30.040 --> 26:36.120
looks like your uncle in a wig and, and, and just as I'm doing right now, it's like those

26:36.120 --> 26:39.000
guys, they cut between them and all those guys that are like, if you know what I mean

26:39.000 --> 26:44.800
about all that like stuff that has to do with their intimacy, them wanting pleasure.

26:44.800 --> 26:50.400
When they got to say that it's ugly, like they just relax, you can see the weight come

26:50.400 --> 26:51.400
off of their shoulders.

26:51.400 --> 26:52.400
And I don't know how to wear a ticket.

26:52.400 --> 26:55.600
I was like, I paused it and I was like saying, like, there's something important here because

26:55.600 --> 26:59.640
like these guys are going like, like it's that then bringing that background to this,

26:59.640 --> 27:05.160
it doesn't feel like punching down, but you're like, you want, we want to punch down like

27:05.160 --> 27:10.280
we have an urge and I don't, I think that probably all human beings feel that like you

27:10.280 --> 27:16.040
we just, we all have some area where we don't, we justify it somehow, like I'll go, I'll

27:16.040 --> 27:20.600
be like in a comment section on Jezebel and like watching under some articles like, Oh,

27:20.600 --> 27:26.080
like here's your thing, like here's your thing where you get to call someone a piece of fucking

27:26.080 --> 27:30.360
subhuman shit, you know, some people need to make a robot to be like, I'm out of her

27:30.360 --> 27:31.360
fucking league.

27:31.360 --> 27:32.360
Yeah.

27:32.360 --> 27:33.360
Yeah.

27:33.360 --> 27:34.360
This guy's like, she's ugly.

27:34.360 --> 27:38.320
I think it's like, they started coming up and I said, I wouldn't fuck her with someone

27:38.320 --> 27:42.200
else's dick and all this stuff and like, like, Oh, you were just, you were just winking and

27:42.200 --> 27:45.720
nudging when you were talking about your own dick, but it's like, I wouldn't fuck her with

27:45.720 --> 27:46.720
someone else's dick.

27:46.720 --> 27:47.720
We're talking about someone else's dick.

27:47.720 --> 27:48.720
We're talking about a robot.

27:48.720 --> 27:49.720
It's like, it's ugly.

27:49.720 --> 27:50.720
It's ugly.

27:50.720 --> 27:51.720
It's ugly.

27:51.720 --> 27:55.480
Like we want to just like, we want to just drown each other because we feel like we're

27:55.480 --> 27:56.480
drowning.

27:56.480 --> 27:58.120
We want to like grab each other's heads and go like, you're ugly.

27:58.120 --> 27:59.120
You're ugly.

27:59.120 --> 28:00.120
You're ugly.

28:00.120 --> 28:01.120
You're ugly.

28:01.120 --> 28:02.120
You're ugly.

28:02.120 --> 28:03.120
I'm not drowning.

28:03.120 --> 28:04.120
I was just in Fiji and I was drowning.

28:04.120 --> 28:05.120
All right.

28:05.120 --> 28:06.120
All right.

28:06.120 --> 28:12.360
Well, I told you, I told you, I was a bad interviewer, I told you what I'll do.

28:12.360 --> 28:13.360
So okay.

28:13.360 --> 28:14.360
Okay.

28:14.360 --> 28:15.480
Would you want to meet my friend Brandon Johnson?

28:15.480 --> 28:16.480
He's black.

28:16.480 --> 28:17.480
Yeah.

28:17.480 --> 28:18.480
He's black.

28:18.480 --> 28:19.480
Okay.

28:19.480 --> 28:20.480
All right.

28:20.480 --> 28:21.480
Let's go.

28:21.480 --> 28:22.480
Oh, Brandon Johnson.

28:22.480 --> 28:35.480
I know we can't deny, trying to leave, I can't go right, soon your tired eyes go blind.

28:35.480 --> 28:36.480
Oh.

28:36.480 --> 28:41.480
I think the magic's already started.

28:41.480 --> 28:44.480
What's up, man?

28:44.480 --> 28:45.480
Welcome.

28:45.480 --> 28:46.480
I'm so happy to be here.

28:46.480 --> 28:47.480
Thanks for having me back, Dan.

28:47.480 --> 28:48.480
Thank you.

28:48.480 --> 28:49.480
Thank you for sharing the stage.

28:49.480 --> 28:53.480
This sweater and this vest and the shirt, like how do you outdress me every goddamn

28:53.480 --> 28:54.480
time?

28:54.480 --> 28:57.480
I think, what would an old-timey black man from the 30s wear?

28:57.480 --> 29:04.080
So, you know, like, I have, have we talked about this before, you and I, I want to be

29:04.080 --> 29:09.480
like one of those 70, 80-year-old dudes that has a kick-ass cane, you know, like a big,

29:09.480 --> 29:10.480
like a bitching hat.

29:10.480 --> 29:11.480
Yeah.

29:11.480 --> 29:14.920
And like just one of those cool old dudes that you see walking down the road and like,

29:14.920 --> 29:18.080
you can pull off like a cane with like an owl head on it.

29:18.080 --> 29:22.080
I wanted to be, I wanted to be full of Jameson and a little bit of weed and a little bit

29:22.080 --> 29:26.080
of cocaine so that when I bump into some young dude and he's like, you old motherfucking,

29:26.080 --> 29:28.080
I could be like, look here, young buck.

29:28.080 --> 29:30.080
Look here.

29:30.080 --> 29:35.080
Got cocaine and marijuana, young buck.

29:35.080 --> 29:38.080
I'm not so unimpressive after all.

29:38.080 --> 29:42.080
Now, and then hit that motherfucker with my cane.

29:42.080 --> 29:44.080
I've changed my ambition.

29:44.080 --> 29:49.080
I want to be at any point in my life where I'm confident in calling anybody young blood.

29:49.080 --> 29:51.080
What's up, young blood?

29:51.080 --> 29:53.080
Don't pray for what you want, man.

29:53.080 --> 29:57.080
I hate young black dudes, man, because they do not.

29:57.080 --> 30:00.080
They give you that look like, you're not cool no more.

30:00.080 --> 30:01.080
They can smell it.

30:01.080 --> 30:03.080
You're an old black dude.

30:03.080 --> 30:04.080
Which is tragic.

30:04.080 --> 30:08.080
Old black woman with like, if she's standing back behind a counter and she serves you a

30:08.080 --> 30:10.080
pork chop, you're like, oh, thanks, old black lady.

30:10.080 --> 30:12.080
That's probably going to be delicious to shit.

30:12.080 --> 30:19.080
But if an old black man in this sweater handed you a pork chop, you'd be like, fuck that.

30:19.080 --> 30:23.080
What did you do wrong in life?

30:23.080 --> 30:27.080
That's a very interesting...

30:27.080 --> 30:31.080
But thank you for the compliment.

30:31.080 --> 30:35.080
I would just say that you look like a very well-dressed, older black gentleman.

30:35.080 --> 30:39.080
I'm just trying to find out who killed Bumpy Knuckles.

30:39.080 --> 30:43.080
Like a fucking 1910 black detective.

30:43.080 --> 30:49.080
Wait, is that a reference or an awesome riff of like, Ursat's black detective?

30:49.080 --> 30:52.080
You haven't heard about the death of Bumpy Knuckles?

30:52.080 --> 30:54.080
It's in all the papers.

30:54.080 --> 30:57.080
Is there any, is there a Charlie Chan for, but black?

30:57.080 --> 31:02.080
Like, is there like an old-timey detective archetype that was a...

31:02.080 --> 31:03.080
Shaft.

31:03.080 --> 31:10.080
I'm not going to throw his detective work under the bus, but...

31:10.080 --> 31:18.080
I mean going back to Charlie Chan days when it was like, is there like a classic Uncle Ben of detecting?

31:18.080 --> 31:22.080
Like...

31:22.080 --> 31:24.080
There isn't, right?

31:24.080 --> 31:29.080
It's so hard, man, because I want to make up a dude for you right now.

31:29.080 --> 31:36.080
You don't know about the work of Charles Duchase? Charles Duchase was the first black actor to play a detective.

31:36.080 --> 31:39.080
And arrested moments later.

31:39.080 --> 31:41.080
Wait, wait, can I bring it back?

31:41.080 --> 31:43.080
Sarah and Beth, I have a question.

31:43.080 --> 31:47.080
Like, just because you're women and feminists and you're making like satire and stuff like that,

31:47.080 --> 31:52.080
do you think right now with Trump being Trump and being in office and all this stuff, do you think,

31:52.080 --> 31:56.080
and I'm hoping it's the case with the march that's going to happen and all this stuff,

31:56.080 --> 32:02.080
do you think there will be some awesome revolution for women now?

32:02.080 --> 32:11.080
Because it's so ridiculous that we all get to actually call this shit out and women get to be full-on vocal activists at all times.

32:11.080 --> 32:18.080
Yeah, I think that like 53% of white women are finally going to latch on to 90s feminism.

32:18.080 --> 32:23.080
Like, they're going to finally catch up with the rest of the world.

32:23.080 --> 32:29.080
And then they're going to make some like movie about it in 20 years and everyone will be really self-satisfied.

32:29.080 --> 32:33.080
Like First Wives Club kind of.

32:33.080 --> 32:37.080
Do you think it'll be that flaccid? It'll be that fleeting and not actual?

32:37.080 --> 32:46.080
I don't think it's a bad thing. I just think that there's seriously a lot of people in this country that need to catch up with just like basic tenets of feminism.

32:46.080 --> 32:55.080
We're not even talking about what Third Wave feminism is even about, just really basic stuff like equal pay and reproductive rights.

32:55.080 --> 32:59.080
Like birth control allows us to have jobs.

32:59.080 --> 33:10.080
Just basing it on the name, I would guess that Third Wave feminism is about diminishing the concept entirely because you can't even get through that name

33:10.080 --> 33:16.080
and getting the subconscious implication that it's fleeting and has been done before and will be done again.

33:16.080 --> 33:21.080
Who came up with that phrase? Is it Proud? Is everyone waving that flag?

33:21.080 --> 33:24.080
Who came up with it? Someone in the audience probably knows better than me.

33:24.080 --> 33:27.080
It sounds like Archie Bunker came up with it.

33:27.080 --> 33:28.080
No.

33:28.080 --> 33:44.080
There's these Third Wave feminists. When you're going to realize you're just women, it doesn't matter how many waves you go through.

33:44.080 --> 33:48.080
They're just waves. They come in, they go out.

33:48.080 --> 33:51.080
Isn't that kind of like a subconscious?

33:51.080 --> 33:54.080
Yeah, we're going to go through our grunge period soon.

33:54.080 --> 33:59.080
It'll just be called Femma Junk. Femma garbage.

33:59.080 --> 34:07.080
I hope it skips 90s grunge and goes straight to awesome punk rock, like riots and shit, like actual revolutionaries.

34:07.080 --> 34:13.080
On record, calling for a physical, actual, prosecutable action.

34:13.080 --> 34:15.080
Alright, I'll back you up.

34:15.080 --> 34:16.080
I'm going with you.

34:16.080 --> 34:21.080
I am. I think it's time to like light time to pick up pitchforks.

34:21.080 --> 34:27.080
Because if tweeting worked, it would get you elected president.

34:27.080 --> 34:38.080
Yeah, I think it's no problem to be on Twitter. It's the world's CB radio, but a guy used it to become our first like actual evil president.

34:38.080 --> 34:43.080
Like just got on Twitter and was like,

34:43.080 --> 34:52.080
Breaker, Breaker, I should be president. And everyone that was like hashtagging cancel Colbert because that didn't work, but that did.

34:52.080 --> 34:57.080
I think that means that Twitter's probably for listening and not so much for getting stuff done.

34:57.080 --> 35:01.080
And then you go back to old wheat-paste flyers.

35:01.080 --> 35:07.080
Wheat-paste. Put shit up on a wall that people have to see. Tell them, fucking, fucking, yeah.

35:07.080 --> 35:14.080
Take down, take down the, the live glasses. Or put them on, put them on, I mean.

35:14.080 --> 35:18.080
Look, I don't know. I'm gonna, I'm just gonna, I'm gonna.

35:18.080 --> 35:22.080
The Dan Harmon get off my lawn segment.

35:22.080 --> 35:26.080
I'm three months from caving. Every time I have a rant on Twitter where I'm like,

35:26.080 --> 35:30.080
This fucking president should be in jail. And then I kind of get this nausea 30 minutes later.

35:30.080 --> 35:33.080
I'm like, What are you doing? You're playing Minecraft. You're gonna get fired.

35:33.080 --> 35:40.080
You just don't, don't, don't lip off. No one else is. What are you and Mark Hamill? What are you doing?

35:40.080 --> 35:44.080
Have you, have you, have you, have you heard what Mark Hamill's doing?

35:44.080 --> 35:45.080
Yeah, the Batman song.

35:45.080 --> 35:50.080
Fucking amazing. Like it's such a brilliant stroke of, like this is a great example of just like every little bit.

35:50.080 --> 35:56.080
Like, like what a great thing. Like, like to just, I'm the last person to know, but so I'm explaining to no one.

35:56.080 --> 36:01.080
But he reads Trump's tweets in the voice of the Joker and it's fucking amazing.

36:01.080 --> 36:07.080
I was just like, Happy New Year to all my haters.

36:07.080 --> 36:12.080
And it's so perfect. Anyway, but, but, but, but yeah, I feel like sometimes I feel like I'm three months out from just going,

36:12.080 --> 36:17.080
Wait a minute, what am I doing? I should just sit in a lawn chair, put on a red baseball cap and say,

36:17.080 --> 36:23.080
Now who loves Trump so much, they're willing to work for some minimum wage for me.

36:23.080 --> 36:27.080
Like I could just game the system. This is how Nazism works.

36:27.080 --> 36:31.080
Like you just guys like me just slowly go, I'm tired.

36:31.080 --> 36:34.080
When is the Women's March the 21st, right?

36:34.080 --> 36:38.080
Yeah, when is, are you guys going to the Women's March? Not that I'm assuming anything because of your gender.

36:38.080 --> 36:39.080
We're going to the one in New York.

36:39.080 --> 36:40.080
You just look like marchers.

36:40.080 --> 36:43.080
Yeah, we're just flying back. So we got to go to our own city.

36:43.080 --> 36:45.080
Oh, are you based out of not LA?

36:45.080 --> 36:46.080
Yeah, we're in New York.

36:46.080 --> 36:47.080
Oh, we're visiting.

36:47.080 --> 36:48.080
Cool.

36:48.080 --> 36:50.080
So all major cities are doing it, right?

36:50.080 --> 36:51.080
Yeah.

36:51.080 --> 36:52.080
I know Boston is.

36:52.080 --> 36:53.080
Oh, I didn't know that.

36:53.080 --> 37:04.080
Cody's flying to DC where an omnibus permit was taken out that prevents any marches during inauguration day to be dedicated to anything meaningful.

37:04.080 --> 37:08.080
I wanted to be a big ass fucking free for all crazy ass.

37:08.080 --> 37:14.080
Like it's going to be huge because there's like, isn't that like four times the buses, like there's 200 buses for inauguration.

37:14.080 --> 37:16.080
There's 1200 buses for the Women's March.

37:16.080 --> 37:17.080
So that's impressive.

37:17.080 --> 37:18.080
Fuck yeah.

37:18.080 --> 37:20.080
I think it's going to be really calm though.

37:20.080 --> 37:23.080
Actually, it's going to be a lot of moans.

37:23.080 --> 37:24.080
It'll be organized and people will be listening to each other.

37:24.080 --> 37:25.080
It'll be amazing.

37:25.080 --> 37:26.080
Yeah.

37:26.080 --> 37:27.080
Yeah.

37:27.080 --> 37:28.080
I hope that's the point of it.

37:28.080 --> 37:31.080
I hope it's fucking eight billion people.

37:31.080 --> 37:33.080
Well, that doesn't add up.

37:33.080 --> 37:35.080
But yeah, that goes off without a hitch.

37:35.080 --> 37:44.080
I hope that reports start coming out of people trying to covertly stir shit up and getting exposed as fucking like, you know, that they're trying desperately to do it.

37:44.080 --> 37:46.080
Because this is an important thing.

37:46.080 --> 37:47.080
Like here's the silver lining.

37:47.080 --> 37:48.080
Like we lost.

37:48.080 --> 37:50.080
Let's talk about left versus right.

37:50.080 --> 37:51.080
We lost.

37:51.080 --> 37:53.080
Like, oh boohoo, that sucks.

37:53.080 --> 37:56.080
But it's like, holy shit, we haven't lost in a long time.

37:56.080 --> 38:02.080
Like we haven't been the people that are allowed to just do anything with no accountability to logic.

38:02.080 --> 38:12.080
You could just say the president's a fucking idiot and you should be thrown in prison and anyone that comes at you and goes like, please, I think these identity politics should be debated.

38:12.080 --> 38:18.080
You're like, fuck you, have fun, like I'm just a fucking insurrectionist.

38:18.080 --> 38:19.080
I lost.

38:19.080 --> 38:21.080
I don't have to fucking like hang out and like obey your laws.

38:21.080 --> 38:22.080
I don't know.

38:22.080 --> 38:25.080
Like, I don't, I'm not saying like.

38:25.080 --> 38:31.080
The sinister part of it is like when the Dixie Chicks talked shit about Bush, they were nearly fucking pilloried.

38:31.080 --> 38:33.080
Like they got a bunch of flak.

38:33.080 --> 38:37.080
Now we get to talk so much shit about Trump because he's such a buffoon.

38:37.080 --> 38:47.080
But like that completely takes all the point of dissent and, what's the word I'm looking for?

38:47.080 --> 38:48.080
Taco.

38:48.080 --> 38:49.080
Taco.

38:49.080 --> 38:52.080
It takes all the taco out of it.

38:52.080 --> 38:56.080
Now talking shit about the president, it doesn't even mean anything.

38:56.080 --> 38:58.080
It doesn't land anywhere.

38:58.080 --> 39:03.080
Like dissent doesn't even matter anymore because who gives a fuck?

39:03.080 --> 39:04.080
I don't think that's true.

39:04.080 --> 39:08.080
I mean, if that's a defeatist statement, I don't agree with that.

39:08.080 --> 39:09.080
I don't think that's true at all.

39:09.080 --> 39:12.080
I think you can see these people in every comment section.

39:12.080 --> 39:14.080
Maybe I'm projecting because maybe it's what I want to see.

39:14.080 --> 39:16.080
Every Twitter thread, everything.

39:16.080 --> 39:28.080
I can see the confusion and the fear and the frustration that used to be ours to bear now being handed over to these stump-humping redneck fuck faces.

39:28.080 --> 39:35.080
And they don't have the attention span we have and they're not gonna vote in 2018 because they got shit to do and be dumb about.

39:35.080 --> 39:36.080
Like they're confused.

39:36.080 --> 39:39.080
They keep saying over and over again, why don't y'all just get back to work?

39:39.080 --> 39:41.080
I'm sorry to make them southern.

39:41.080 --> 39:46.080
Like, this is because a lot of the Trump thing is, it's not fucking like—

39:46.080 --> 39:51.080
We got it in that—I just did it but I'm like punching down on fucking like—

39:51.080 --> 39:55.400
like fucking, like labor, you know, but like,

39:55.400 --> 39:57.960
there's a big part of that movement is exploitation

39:57.960 --> 40:01.000
of those people by people that are like fucking just profiting.

40:01.000 --> 40:04.400
So, but all of those people across the board,

40:04.400 --> 40:07.320
all of that meming and tweeting and all that shit,

40:07.320 --> 40:09.280
like that was like Snickers bar energy

40:09.280 --> 40:11.960
compared to like the energy you have from eating a turkey.

40:11.960 --> 40:15.840
Like they can't last and they're like confused.

40:15.840 --> 40:17.600
Like they just keep going, yeah, but emails

40:17.600 --> 40:19.480
and you keep going, she lost.

40:19.480 --> 40:22.640
Back to talking about how he's a dumb fuck that can't spell

40:22.640 --> 40:25.240
and should be thrown in a hole with sharp sticks

40:25.240 --> 40:29.160
on the bottom, well, but if Obama, but if Obama,

40:29.160 --> 40:34.160
nothing mother fucker, I'm talking about my president.

40:35.520 --> 40:39.280
I'm talking, like, I'm just a dumb fucking idiot

40:39.280 --> 40:42.160
that just wants to cause trouble, ever heard of it?

40:44.160 --> 40:46.640
But must suck to be in your,

40:46.640 --> 40:48.720
not even in your first 100 days in office

40:48.720 --> 40:51.160
and you just got a bunch of people just clawing at you

40:51.160 --> 40:54.120
like cats, like just spreading any rumor they can.

40:54.120 --> 40:57.040
Oh God, Lou, why do you want to see my tax return so much?

40:57.040 --> 40:59.160
It's as if I wasn't born in America.

41:01.160 --> 41:03.480
Like, will you people stop at nothing

41:03.480 --> 41:06.040
to just ruin everything?

41:06.040 --> 41:06.880
Yeah!

41:08.000 --> 41:09.760
And it's how I always wanted to feel

41:09.760 --> 41:11.640
and it was harder when there was this handsome,

41:11.640 --> 41:13.080
articulate black guy in office

41:13.080 --> 41:14.360
that wanted everyone to have healthcare.

41:14.360 --> 41:16.160
Yeah, but there's harder.

41:16.160 --> 41:17.800
It was hard to wake up jaded.

41:17.800 --> 41:18.720
It was hard.

41:18.720 --> 41:19.840
Now it's easy.

41:19.840 --> 41:21.640
Now it's like the way it should be.

41:21.640 --> 41:23.720
He's a king and a fucking idiot

41:23.720 --> 41:26.680
and I'm a fucking jester and I can just, yeah!

41:26.680 --> 41:30.640
He's made out of smoke and cotton candy,

41:30.640 --> 41:32.960
like, you can't throw a dart that will stick in him

41:32.960 --> 41:33.840
because he doesn't exist.

41:33.840 --> 41:35.320
He's like, he's a concept.

41:35.320 --> 41:37.920
Like, you can't actually nail him on anything

41:37.920 --> 41:40.560
because he doesn't give a fuck about accuracy or truth.

41:40.560 --> 41:41.400
Who cares?

41:41.400 --> 41:43.400
He does like 80 cartoonish things a day though.

41:43.400 --> 41:44.760
He's like Scrooge McDuck.

41:44.760 --> 41:48.160
So you're like, hey, that crazy thing you did,

41:48.160 --> 41:49.640
he's already on to the next one.

41:49.640 --> 41:50.880
Like, he...

41:50.880 --> 41:53.960
Yeah, which is brilliant because like nothing lands.

41:53.960 --> 41:57.800
Like he can just, that crazy fucking horrible dog shit.

41:57.800 --> 42:00.240
It's not like if everyone starts talking about something,

42:00.240 --> 42:02.360
he won't fucking obsess about it

42:02.360 --> 42:04.480
and start melting down on Twitter.

42:04.480 --> 42:05.520
He fucking does.

42:05.520 --> 42:09.080
I think what you do is not politics, not campaign,

42:09.080 --> 42:13.040
not policy stuff, simply talk about how he looks.

42:13.040 --> 42:14.960
Just call him chubby.

42:14.960 --> 42:17.840
If we all agree to just call him chubby pants.

42:17.840 --> 42:19.760
I think he'd fucking blow his brains out.

42:19.760 --> 42:20.720
He's so vain.

42:20.720 --> 42:22.240
I think you should do that

42:22.240 --> 42:24.600
because when you talk about how people dress

42:24.600 --> 42:27.800
and how they look, like it carries weight.

42:27.800 --> 42:28.640
Like...

42:31.080 --> 42:32.360
It does because...

42:35.160 --> 42:36.400
Because it's in your essence

42:36.400 --> 42:39.080
because people would like you to say that they dress well.

42:39.080 --> 42:43.240
I like that shirt your way.

42:46.240 --> 42:47.840
And I think that...

42:47.840 --> 42:48.840
I don't...

42:48.840 --> 42:52.000
I think Mark Hamill should read his tweets as the Joker

42:52.000 --> 42:56.560
and I think that Nabisco should say he's not crunchy enough.

42:56.560 --> 42:58.200
I don't...

42:58.200 --> 43:00.800
I think that if you...

43:00.800 --> 43:02.960
And I think that it doesn't...

43:02.960 --> 43:06.960
If we can monetize criticism, this might actually work.

43:06.960 --> 43:10.880
Our emphasis on how things get done

43:10.880 --> 43:13.160
and whether something is going to work

43:13.160 --> 43:16.680
and whether or not a bratty kid just wants your attention

43:16.680 --> 43:19.520
and therefore you should think counter-intuitively,

43:19.520 --> 43:22.880
like the only silver lining of this defeat

43:22.880 --> 43:25.400
and the situation we're in is that we don't have to spend

43:25.400 --> 43:27.560
that much brain power on that shit anymore.

43:27.560 --> 43:32.080
You can just figuratively put a frag in a bottle

43:32.080 --> 43:36.400
and light it and throw it in any general direction, figuratively.

43:36.400 --> 43:39.840
Yeah, good luck with that shit.

43:39.840 --> 43:43.280
Some of us have a lot of work we got to do,

43:43.280 --> 43:47.720
digging the trenches to live in and the caves to hide in,

43:47.720 --> 43:49.280
but you're right.

43:49.280 --> 43:52.120
You could just put that red hat on.

43:52.120 --> 43:53.800
I like your stance, though.

43:53.800 --> 43:56.000
Your stance is that we should fuck with this dude

43:56.000 --> 43:59.080
until he's up out of office, like more than ever before.

43:59.080 --> 44:03.400
And, Bre, you are my second of two black friends that I have.

44:03.400 --> 44:06.800
The other one called and said they could not make it.

44:06.800 --> 44:10.200
I've had this conversation where I was like,

44:10.200 --> 44:14.320
no, dude, you don't have to, like I get it,

44:14.320 --> 44:16.360
like I don't get it, but I get that I don't get it,

44:16.360 --> 44:20.640
and I get that it's like, I'm not gonna be like,

44:20.640 --> 44:23.160
what are you guys doing to women and black people,

44:23.160 --> 44:25.840
and especially not black women?

44:25.840 --> 44:28.800
Because it's like the line was towed and all this shit,

44:28.800 --> 44:30.080
and it's like, yeah, this is a time

44:30.080 --> 44:34.000
as that Chappelle sketch on SNL, and it's like, yeah.

44:34.000 --> 44:36.400
White people are like fucking having to deal with frustration

44:36.400 --> 44:38.800
for the first time in their lives.

44:38.800 --> 44:43.160
I get whatever, like take the bench, my friend.

44:43.160 --> 44:44.040
Yes.

44:44.040 --> 44:45.920
I am your globetrotter.

44:45.920 --> 44:48.120
I unfortunately cannot do that as the game

44:48.120 --> 44:52.760
seems to keep coming to me, but I will say it is,

44:52.760 --> 44:55.800
if you're a historian, there's a way to look at what's

44:55.800 --> 44:57.440
about to happen in a way that doesn't necessarily

44:57.440 --> 44:58.240
have to get you down.

44:58.240 --> 45:00.840
It's kind of interesting, because if you're a historian,

45:00.840 --> 45:03.520
it's one of the most interesting things to ever happen.

45:03.520 --> 45:06.040
So like, if you don't become an activist,

45:06.040 --> 45:08.920
there's still something interesting about being,

45:08.920 --> 45:10.480
about paying attention to what's happening.

45:10.480 --> 45:11.320
Yeah.

45:11.320 --> 45:13.040
You know, no matter whether you're getting into it

45:13.040 --> 45:15.760
to stop it, or whether you're sitting on the sidelines,

45:15.760 --> 45:17.000
or whether you're an activist,

45:17.000 --> 45:19.760
it's still a crazy fucking time to witness.

45:19.760 --> 45:23.960
Yeah, and I think with a potential healthy result,

45:23.960 --> 45:29.120
like, because it is, I sat on this stage for four years

45:29.120 --> 45:32.600
and ran my mouth about bipartisan systems full of shit.

45:32.600 --> 45:34.800
And it's like, I don't know, like Keith Olberman did

45:34.800 --> 45:38.320
a thing the other day where it was like, would you trade?

45:38.320 --> 45:41.520
There's a way that we could all just vote for Mitt Romney,

45:41.520 --> 45:43.760
like really search yourself, but like, you know what?

45:43.760 --> 45:47.840
It's like, I'm craving the bipartisan system as comfort

45:47.840 --> 45:49.560
until we can figure out how to fix it.

45:49.560 --> 45:51.080
This is not fixing it.

45:51.080 --> 45:54.520
And like, I have to, that's making me recognize

45:54.520 --> 45:56.960
that all of my anarchist bullshit about like,

45:56.960 --> 45:58.720
oh, the system is stupid, why do I have to choose

45:58.720 --> 46:00.000
between Coke and Pepsi?

46:00.000 --> 46:02.240
Well, because corn syrup isn't human urine.

46:03.360 --> 46:07.120
It's bad for you, but it's not human urine bad for you.

46:07.120 --> 46:08.880
That's a bad example of human urine is actually better

46:08.880 --> 46:09.880
for you than corn syrup, right?

46:09.880 --> 46:12.560
Because it contains water and probably human nutrients.

46:12.560 --> 46:13.520
And delicious.

46:15.600 --> 46:17.800
Anyways, where did we get off?

46:17.800 --> 46:22.800
As women and comedy people, does your website have boobs?

46:24.800 --> 46:25.640
No.

46:25.640 --> 46:26.960
Actually, yes.

46:26.960 --> 46:31.960
Does the, do you guys, like, it's like,

46:34.560 --> 46:39.560
do you have to have conversations where you tally,

46:39.840 --> 46:42.200
like, I'm trying to figure out, like, I wanna talk

46:42.200 --> 46:43.840
about the comedic aspect of it,

46:43.840 --> 46:46.120
where comedy becomes industry,

46:46.120 --> 46:50.400
where it becomes like kind of where you're talking,

46:50.400 --> 46:52.400
you have to talk about shit that's not coming from

46:52.400 --> 46:54.200
just the thing you naturally wanna do.

46:54.200 --> 46:56.440
Are you guys just following your bliss

46:56.440 --> 46:58.920
every time someone moves to write something,

46:58.920 --> 47:01.640
or is there some kind of like restraint

47:01.640 --> 47:03.440
or guidance being put on it

47:03.440 --> 47:05.520
as what I was trying to get at before?

47:05.520 --> 47:07.240
There's a lot of restraint.

47:07.240 --> 47:12.120
Yeah, I mean, we follow our bliss to a point

47:12.120 --> 47:14.520
where the idea actually has to be clear and readable

47:14.520 --> 47:16.320
so that when you're scanning through Facebook or Twitter,

47:16.320 --> 47:17.920
you're like, I get that.

47:17.920 --> 47:19.160
So you have to have conversations like,

47:19.160 --> 47:20.560
well, what's the joke here?

47:20.560 --> 47:22.960
And if it's the same as the joke in the last thing,

47:22.960 --> 47:25.080
then, okay, let's come up with a different thing, or?

47:25.080 --> 47:27.040
Yeah, we gotta, like, reign in our bliss.

47:27.040 --> 47:28.480
We can't go that far.

47:28.480 --> 47:30.440
What you haven't run, if there's headlines

47:30.440 --> 47:31.400
that you've turned down,

47:31.400 --> 47:33.600
because you have so many, your bylines are hilarious.

47:33.600 --> 47:35.520
And is there anything that you've ever been like,

47:35.520 --> 47:37.240
that's too fucked up?

47:37.240 --> 47:38.400
All the time.

47:38.400 --> 47:40.400
Sometimes there's jokes that really appeal to us

47:40.400 --> 47:41.920
as feminists that are sort of like laughing

47:41.920 --> 47:43.240
at ourselves as feminists,

47:43.240 --> 47:45.880
but then we're like, what will the opposition do

47:45.880 --> 47:48.960
when they get a hold of this sort of thing?

47:48.960 --> 47:50.480
And we're like, we can't put this out there,

47:50.480 --> 47:53.800
because it's just, a lot of like, MRA trolls

47:53.800 --> 47:57.400
will see our articles as real, as written by real women,

47:57.400 --> 47:59.560
and obviously they hate women.

47:59.560 --> 48:01.960
So every article we write is an example

48:01.960 --> 48:03.720
of how women are dumb and terrible

48:03.720 --> 48:06.000
because we're satirizing women's media.

48:06.000 --> 48:10.200
Yeah, like one article we put out a couple months back,

48:10.200 --> 48:13.000
if Trump wins, I'm moving to Alaska.

48:13.000 --> 48:17.160
People thought it was real and made a call

48:17.160 --> 48:19.120
to get the writer fired.

48:19.120 --> 48:21.400
And someone wrote an open letter.

48:21.400 --> 48:26.400
I'm sorry, that's the, them taking it seriously

48:26.760 --> 48:29.080
is one thing that I've seen with the onion,

48:29.080 --> 48:30.640
the people that take the onion thing,

48:30.640 --> 48:35.000
but that blows my mind, the idea of like, get her fired,

48:35.000 --> 48:38.520
because then reductress will be all cleaned up for me.

48:38.520 --> 48:43.520
But it's really just about punishing this woman from,

48:44.000 --> 48:47.320
you should fire her from, it's like trying to,

48:47.320 --> 48:49.560
it's like, imagine trying to get someone fired

48:49.560 --> 48:50.640
from the Ku Klux Klan.

48:50.640 --> 48:53.560
It's like, it really gives you, yeah.

48:53.560 --> 48:54.640
Sure it happens.

48:54.640 --> 48:57.960
Let me show up dirty.

48:57.960 --> 49:02.960
Someone wrote like a thousand word blog post

49:03.520 --> 49:05.600
just to articulate the fact that Alaska

49:05.600 --> 49:07.120
is in the United States.

49:07.120 --> 49:09.520
Like they're like, that was a sex robot moment.

49:09.520 --> 49:13.800
Like you really felt superior to this fictional writer.

49:13.800 --> 49:15.800
So if everybody's just dumb,

49:15.800 --> 49:18.360
now this is just broadening out into like, okay.

49:18.360 --> 49:20.200
I think we all agree, yeah.

49:20.200 --> 49:21.360
Most people are dumb.

49:21.360 --> 49:23.320
The average IQ is 100.

49:23.320 --> 49:27.720
America has perhaps heroically, perhaps villainously,

49:27.720 --> 49:32.720
spent its time on top reallocating assets

49:32.720 --> 49:37.720
slowly from the future educated children.

49:38.520 --> 49:42.680
Like we've been focusing on dumbness,

49:42.680 --> 49:44.360
like we're in horse sense.

49:44.360 --> 49:45.720
We're like, oh, we're cowboys

49:45.720 --> 49:49.080
and we're gonna rustle the doggies of the world

49:49.080 --> 49:52.720
and like who needs to care if evolution is real

49:52.720 --> 49:53.720
in order for that to happen.

49:53.720 --> 49:57.200
You just need a lasso and a bomb.

49:57.200 --> 50:02.200
And so I guess as young comedy people who have no choice

50:05.480 --> 50:07.880
but to be thinking about a wish for the world

50:07.880 --> 50:11.520
because you're not jaded nihilistic troll people

50:11.520 --> 50:14.320
who are just going like, fuck you, you're stupid.

50:14.320 --> 50:16.640
And the world is stupid.

50:16.640 --> 50:19.080
Do you guys, is there a goal?

50:19.080 --> 50:22.320
Are we supposed to just make dumb people smart with comedy?

50:22.320 --> 50:26.360
Are we supposed to just like try to avoid getting shot?

50:26.360 --> 50:28.560
Are we supposed to like shift things

50:28.560 --> 50:30.720
so that 60 years from now in a world

50:30.720 --> 50:33.800
we don't get to participate in, things are better?

50:33.800 --> 50:36.080
Am I overreacting to?

50:36.080 --> 50:39.440
I think we have to like dumb down our message for them

50:39.440 --> 50:40.280
in a way, because like-

50:40.280 --> 50:42.120
Simplify, we need to simplify.

50:42.120 --> 50:44.320
Simplify, like speaking to your point

50:44.320 --> 50:46.040
of like taking Trump down at all costs,

50:46.040 --> 50:47.720
like similar to George Bush in 10 years,

50:47.720 --> 50:49.560
all these people are gonna pretend that they hated Trump

50:49.560 --> 50:51.280
and they're gonna pretend they didn't vote for him.

50:51.280 --> 50:55.120
So like my goal is not to take down Donald Trump

50:55.120 --> 50:56.600
and convince them he has a tiny penis.

50:56.600 --> 50:59.680
Like the goal I think is to like shift their focus

50:59.680 --> 51:02.600
and be like, hey, like healthcare is good.

51:02.600 --> 51:04.600
Black people deserve to live.

51:04.600 --> 51:06.760
Like just like focus.

51:06.760 --> 51:07.800
Hilarious.

51:07.800 --> 51:10.280
Slow down, slow down.

51:11.960 --> 51:13.680
Let's take it one step at a time.

51:13.680 --> 51:18.680
And what's like, if you give us comedy tips,

51:18.920 --> 51:22.480
if I'm like, if I'm a satirical journalist

51:22.480 --> 51:24.120
and I'm like, I wanna do a bit,

51:24.120 --> 51:25.120
like because there's a,

51:25.120 --> 51:26.480
you can see it misfiring a lot.

51:26.480 --> 51:29.280
People think that satire means a lot of times

51:29.280 --> 51:33.120
just pretty much non-ironic kind of like sarcasm,

51:33.120 --> 51:37.000
like sarcasm, which creates a sarcasm

51:37.000 --> 51:40.000
between that you're trying to,

51:40.000 --> 51:41.440
but like there's an art.

51:41.440 --> 51:43.520
There's a real art to like,

51:43.520 --> 51:47.440
like like leading people around to an absurd thought

51:47.440 --> 51:50.080
that forces them to realize something

51:50.080 --> 51:51.840
like black people deserve healthcare,

51:51.840 --> 51:54.400
but you don't do it by typing an article

51:54.400 --> 51:57.960
that says, black people don't deserve healthcare.

51:57.960 --> 51:58.800
Get it?

51:58.800 --> 52:02.840
I'm not, again, I don't know why I'm explaining this to you.

52:04.680 --> 52:06.240
The, the, my guess, my question is,

52:06.240 --> 52:08.000
is there, do you have any like little tip,

52:08.000 --> 52:10.480
like like a fundamental philosophical kind of tip?

52:10.480 --> 52:13.040
Like, like where I'm trying to think of an example

52:13.040 --> 52:15.040
of from another field where it's like,

52:15.040 --> 52:16.800
if a welder were to say,

52:16.800 --> 52:19.240
or if a football quarterback were to say,

52:19.240 --> 52:21.920
follow through like, like, like, or, you know,

52:21.920 --> 52:24.360
just some simple thing that when it comes to like,

52:24.360 --> 52:27.040
I, like, like parody and stuff where you're actually

52:27.040 --> 52:29.120
hoping that the end result will be somebody laughing

52:29.120 --> 52:30.880
and then also like, looking themselves,

52:30.880 --> 52:34.880
is there like a kind of guiding principle

52:34.880 --> 52:39.120
that is separates the craftsman from the,

52:39.120 --> 52:42.200
from the, from the non-crafts people?

52:42.200 --> 52:44.360
I mean, this might seem really obvious saying it out loud,

52:44.360 --> 52:49.360
but that your headline actually says what you are trying to say.

52:49.480 --> 52:52.080
Like, if you're like, okay, what's the joke of this piece?

52:52.080 --> 52:53.960
And you're like, well, I think it's this, this, this, this.

52:53.960 --> 52:56.720
And if that's not actually reflected in the headline,

52:56.720 --> 52:59.160
then like, you wouldn't believe how many times that happens.

52:59.160 --> 53:00.000
It's just, no.

53:00.000 --> 53:02.440
Is that a, wait, I'm not sure if you're citing a,

53:02.440 --> 53:05.600
like, give me an example or, or clarify more,

53:05.600 --> 53:07.360
because I'm not sure if you're, I'm sorry.

53:07.360 --> 53:09.320
I just opened up Pandora's box.

53:09.320 --> 53:10.480
I don't know.

53:10.480 --> 53:12.960
It's when the headline is super funny, it's a joke,

53:12.960 --> 53:15.040
but it doesn't relate to any of the article.

53:15.040 --> 53:16.360
The article can't back it up.

53:16.360 --> 53:17.880
So you sort of lose steam.

53:17.880 --> 53:19.760
So do you mean the headline kind of encapsulates

53:19.760 --> 53:21.600
the whole bit right there, right?

53:21.600 --> 53:23.560
Or do you, but I thought you might've been saying,

53:23.560 --> 53:26.360
like, actually the headline shouldn't even be ironic

53:26.360 --> 53:27.200
or it should be.

53:27.200 --> 53:28.880
Ah, I don't know.

53:28.880 --> 53:30.760
I mean, the whole joke is there in the headline.

53:30.760 --> 53:33.120
There's no like buried lead, basically.

53:33.120 --> 53:36.040
Like what, what you're agreeing to click on

53:36.040 --> 53:37.840
is what you're going to get in that article,

53:37.840 --> 53:40.920
unlike a lot of mainstream journalism, which currently

53:40.920 --> 53:43.200
is like, what will people click on in this headline?

53:43.200 --> 53:46.640
Let's pick one random phrase from this article.

53:46.640 --> 53:48.280
How much are you, when you guys write something

53:48.280 --> 53:50.680
that's like, obviously satirical or a parodic,

53:50.680 --> 53:53.840
that are you writing and hoping,

53:53.840 --> 53:56.240
because like satire is not for everybody.

53:56.240 --> 53:58.280
And people don't know that a lot, like you're joking

53:58.280 --> 54:00.240
when you say, I'm moving to Alaska.

54:00.240 --> 54:02.560
That, that, that's, that's the whole joke

54:02.560 --> 54:03.640
is in the headline there.

54:03.640 --> 54:05.240
Like that's, that's all there.

54:05.240 --> 54:09.040
Are you writing for, how, what percent are you hoping

54:09.040 --> 54:13.360
that stupid people bite on that and write crazy blog posts

54:13.360 --> 54:15.560
and are inflamed by that?

54:15.560 --> 54:17.840
Or are you, are you hoping that everybody gets the joke

54:17.840 --> 54:20.360
and it's hilarious across the board?

54:20.360 --> 54:22.400
We never write for the dum-dums.

54:22.400 --> 54:25.760
Uh, we, we're not, we're not trying to change anyone's mind.

54:25.760 --> 54:28.680
We're, it's usually, we're usually trying to guilt

54:28.680 --> 54:30.560
and shame the well-intentioned liberals

54:30.560 --> 54:33.120
who are not actually fixing the problem in hand.

54:33.120 --> 54:35.560
So like, we'll do things like, these headlines.

54:35.560 --> 54:36.400
Woo!

54:36.400 --> 54:38.240
I love that.

54:38.240 --> 54:39.400
There's, so, we'll do-

54:39.400 --> 54:40.960
So you mean, all of San Francisco?

54:40.960 --> 54:41.800
Yeah.

54:41.800 --> 54:42.920
Woo!

54:42.920 --> 54:44.960
Like, we'll do a headline that's like,

54:44.960 --> 54:46.720
these headlines about Black Lives Matter

54:46.720 --> 54:49.080
are breaking my heart as I scroll past them.

54:49.080 --> 54:49.920
Or something, you know?

54:49.920 --> 54:53.200
And it just sort of is like, a lot of them are like,

54:53.200 --> 54:55.160
hey, white women, you're not helping.

54:55.160 --> 54:56.000
You know?

54:56.000 --> 54:56.840
Right, right, right.

54:56.840 --> 54:58.920
Or like, I can't believe this country is so racist,

54:58.920 --> 55:01.120
says employee of all whites startup.

55:01.120 --> 55:06.120
Like, and, and I mean like, I think even in that one

55:06.120 --> 55:10.040
was a tweak where we're never, we try to avoid making,

55:11.240 --> 55:13.560
you know, talking about like, oh, big rich white man.

55:13.560 --> 55:15.120
Because I think like, anyone in this room

55:15.120 --> 55:17.440
can like point at a white rich CEO

55:17.440 --> 55:18.680
and be like, that guy sucks.

55:18.680 --> 55:21.160
We try to kind of get it a little more specific

55:21.160 --> 55:24.600
and that specificity kind of makes us all turn inward

55:24.600 --> 55:27.200
and look at ourselves a little bit more.

55:27.200 --> 55:29.240
We all have a little rich white man inside of us.

55:29.240 --> 55:30.080
We do!

55:30.080 --> 55:31.920
That's cool.

55:31.920 --> 55:34.720
I mean, that guy is just not profitable.

55:34.720 --> 55:38.760
I, I, I, I, I have one every night.

55:41.360 --> 55:42.200
Richard, they're better.

55:42.200 --> 55:43.720
His name is Dan Harmon.

55:43.720 --> 55:46.560
I actually do, as a side note, when you guys,

55:46.560 --> 55:48.720
when you guys do encounter that thing where it's like

55:48.720 --> 55:51.800
somebody, even as individuals or as reductrists,

55:51.800 --> 55:55.280
but like, I know, when you encounter the situation

55:55.280 --> 55:59.200
where you accidentally snared somebody,

55:59.200 --> 56:01.760
like you're like just doing something that was like,

56:01.760 --> 56:05.280
ironic and somebody does go, like,

56:05.280 --> 56:06.840
that makes you feel bad, doesn't it?

56:06.840 --> 56:09.480
Or not to lead you, but it makes me feel bad.

56:09.480 --> 56:11.920
Like, I feel like I just feel like I fucked up or something.

56:11.920 --> 56:14.360
Sometimes it's like too true for people

56:14.360 --> 56:15.880
and you're like, I don't know,

56:15.880 --> 56:18.160
like did I want to hurt this person?

56:19.160 --> 56:21.280
I love that some dude is sitting in his apartment like,

56:21.280 --> 56:23.200
why you pick on me, you know I dumb.

56:27.600 --> 56:28.760
I kind of feel that way sometimes.

56:28.760 --> 56:30.920
I feel like, I feel like, I feel like we've come

56:30.920 --> 56:34.560
as close as we've ever come in this last election

56:34.560 --> 56:39.560
where like, a lot of people are saying like,

56:40.280 --> 56:44.000
oh, well, in a world where some of us experience shame

56:44.000 --> 56:47.640
for not being society's ideal of beautiful,

56:47.640 --> 56:48.960
that some people are saying,

56:48.960 --> 56:50.480
this is not my speech about it.

56:50.480 --> 56:51.960
We ignored the Rust Belt.

56:51.960 --> 56:54.000
Fuck it, fuck them, I'm from Wisconsin,

56:54.000 --> 56:55.640
fuck that part of me.

56:55.640 --> 57:00.640
I'm just saying like, that I've had conversations

57:01.920 --> 57:05.600
with who I thought were smart friends of mine

57:05.600 --> 57:09.960
that were like, yeah, but I'd rather him than Hillary

57:09.960 --> 57:12.080
and like you go down this road and like,

57:12.080 --> 57:14.920
you always come down to this like little channel

57:14.920 --> 57:16.440
that's filled with like little rats

57:16.440 --> 57:20.800
and bits of newspaper, but there's like this fundamental

57:20.800 --> 57:24.640
almost chagrinning honesty about how it's

57:24.640 --> 57:27.040
an anti-intellectual revolution.

57:27.040 --> 57:30.600
That all of this, like that shaming people

57:30.600 --> 57:35.160
about punctuation and not understanding the world

57:35.160 --> 57:39.520
and things like that, what is my point?

57:39.520 --> 57:41.920
It's only an observation, it's not about,

57:41.920 --> 57:44.240
we didn't do fucking shit wrong, we're good people.

57:44.240 --> 57:46.200
I'm not saying that at all, that's not my thesis.

57:46.200 --> 57:47.840
I just like, I think it's an interesting observation

57:47.840 --> 57:51.880
that we've come as close as we ever have in our life

57:51.880 --> 57:53.840
of a group of Americans saying like,

57:53.840 --> 57:56.840
I've been feeling dumb because I'm dumb for a long time

57:56.840 --> 57:59.640
and I was just hoping maybe dumb people could be in control.

57:59.640 --> 58:04.640
Like they dressed that up when Bush, with the Bush thing,

58:04.920 --> 58:07.160
they used to dress that up and that they're getting closer

58:07.160 --> 58:10.240
and closer to just going dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb.

58:10.240 --> 58:12.400
I read this article that was pretty interesting

58:12.400 --> 58:17.400
that was about how the Trump election is kind of similar

58:18.160 --> 58:22.400
to Insane Clown Posse followers, the juggalos,

58:22.400 --> 58:25.600
where they've created this community

58:25.600 --> 58:28.560
that basically exists to say fuck you to anything

58:28.560 --> 58:31.160
that would say fuck you to my community.

58:31.160 --> 58:34.680
And so in doing, they've kind of created this armor

58:34.680 --> 58:37.600
where it's like anything can be used

58:37.600 --> 58:40.240
to then justify their own means

58:40.240 --> 58:43.000
because their whole premise was just out of anger

58:43.000 --> 58:47.160
and resentment of just, almost the same kind of things

58:47.160 --> 58:49.000
that we have anger and resentment for,

58:49.000 --> 58:50.280
but just other things too.

58:50.280 --> 58:54.040
It's almost as if the municipal communities,

58:54.040 --> 58:56.560
places in port cities, places, the nerve centers

58:56.560 --> 58:59.000
of the giant animal called the country

58:59.000 --> 59:03.000
that are often dismissed and don't have electoral power

59:03.000 --> 59:04.800
because they're city slickers.

59:04.800 --> 59:09.360
Like they're folded over on themselves eight times,

59:09.360 --> 59:10.400
which is the maximum.

59:10.400 --> 59:12.040
And so they're all in contact with each other

59:12.040 --> 59:13.160
in a big sandwich.

59:13.160 --> 59:15.200
So even if they do have a low IQ,

59:15.200 --> 59:19.280
they have a snobbishness to them when it comes

59:19.280 --> 59:22.080
to what you say to an Indian man

59:22.080 --> 59:23.680
when you meet him at the deli.

59:25.080 --> 59:26.720
And then you're in these other states

59:26.720 --> 59:28.720
where the electoral power is so high.

59:28.720 --> 59:30.520
And the positive way of looking at it

59:30.520 --> 59:33.040
isn't so much like, oh, they're trying to take over.

59:33.040 --> 59:36.800
They wish that the whole country was a cattle ranch

59:36.800 --> 59:41.800
or a welding factory where you make welding.

59:41.800 --> 59:46.800
What they're actually saying is, oh, first fold.

59:48.280 --> 59:49.400
Weird.

59:49.400 --> 59:51.280
We're like, we're out of the eighth fold.

59:51.280 --> 59:54.280
And they're like, it's weird to be folded

59:54.280 --> 59:56.040
because the internet folded them.

59:56.040 --> 59:58.240
So they're having their first experiences

59:58.240 --> 01:00:03.240
with things that you learn if you go to college in a big city.

01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:08.240
If you go from the Midwest to the nearest big city

01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:13.240
and as you follow that path,

01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:18.240
if I could just show you at Elbrick's Defending Your Life

01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:21.240
montage of how dumb I've been

01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:24.240
and how the dumb things are like,

01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:27.240
it didn't stop five minutes ago in the green room.

01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:29.240
I'm just like, like meeting you guys, I'm just babbling.

01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:31.240
I'm just like trying to figure out

01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:33.240
what I'm eating, you guys, I'm just babbling.

01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:35.240
I'm just like trying to prove I'm a good person.

01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:38.240
Imagine the shame of being just a dumb shit.

01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:42.240
Just a big, dumb shit bucket eating fucking moron

01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:47.240
from a fucking town full of 800 fucking idiot.

01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:49.240
He eats the shit bucket.

01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:50.240
He doesn't even eat the shit.

01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:52.240
He eats the whole bucket.

01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:54.240
There's a shame there.

01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:56.240
I think shame's our biggest problem.

01:00:56.240 --> 01:00:59.240
I think it's white fragility and male fragility in a nutshell

01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:01.240
because it's like, when you tell someone,

01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:04.240
hey, the thing you guys always do hurts me as a person.

01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:06.240
They experience a tiny fraction of that pain.

01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:08.240
They're like, oh, I hurt someone.

01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:12.240
Well, the part that I just heard was the thing you guys always do.

01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:16.240
And I was processing and I was like, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you.

01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:19.240
Well, you're telling me that it hurts you.

01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:22.240
But in a lot of instances, you're like, hey, the thing you do kills us.

01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:25.240
And then they're like, that hurts our feelings for you to say that.

01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:30.240
And you're like, but on our side, that's a little bit bigger.

01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:34.240
Microcosm is every relationship where,

01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:37.240
because I just had one tonight where it's like,

01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:41.240
I didn't have a fight with my girlfriend, but we had a thing.

01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:45.240
It's like, we love each other so much that any turbulence

01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:51.240
causes a conversation of, if someone were to express a need,

01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:55.240
if someone were to say, oh, I'm dissatisfied in this area.

01:01:55.240 --> 01:01:59.240
When I hear that, unless I'm fucking on point and sober

01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:02.240
and ready for anything and have just finished breathing four times,

01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:06.240
taking four second breaths and have a big mouthful of peanut butter

01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:09.240
and I got a sheep on my dick.

01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:12.240
I don't know what my idea I'm in a hammock.

01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:16.240
Whatever the ideal is, unless those ideal situations are met,

01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:22.240
I'm bound to hear your dissatisfaction as,

01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:24.240
I fucked up, I fucked up.

01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:29.240
Now, it's easy to, when you look back on it after your autonomic system cools down,

01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:32.240
we always look back and go, oh, that person told me I fucked up.

01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:38.240
And wow, they must really give a fuck to tell me that.

01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:45.240
And also, my ability to say I fucked up is actually pretty cool, sexy, alpha.

01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:50.240
But in that moment, you're like, I'm always like,

01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:53.240
I didn't fuck up, I didn't fuck up.

01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:56.240
You should know, okay, maybe I did fuck up,

01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:59.240
but that definitely pales in comparison to your fuck ups.

01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:03.240
Even just telling me I fucked up is kind of a fuck up if you think about it.

01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:07.240
There's just this like scramble and it's a panic that is equivalent to

01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:10.240
when you're drowning, it's fight or flight.

01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:12.240
And there's something romantic about that,

01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:16.240
when you're feeling fight or flight, don't shake your head, Brandon.

01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:20.240
At the heart of it, at the heart of it all is like,

01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:22.240
why would you pan?

01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:27.240
It's like, if you watch like a war movie about Nazis,

01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:29.240
like they're herding people into a camp,

01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:33.240
there's not a ton of like, ow, my shoes hurt.

01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:36.240
What the fuck are you saying that for? I'm a fucking good Nazi.

01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:40.240
They're like not hearing them and not looking at them as humans.

01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:44.240
And there's like, there is a place you can get to where hatred and

01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:46.240
and privilege and all of the things that we're struggling with,

01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:49.240
like get to a place where it's like, holy shit, it's really bad.

01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:55.240
And right now for it to be in a place of people freaking out all the time,

01:03:55.240 --> 01:03:59.240
like the fact that the internet is a goddamn fucking like cesspool

01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:04.240
is because like we're getting hurt by each other

01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:07.240
and half of us were 20% of us or whatever are getting hurt by the idea

01:04:07.240 --> 01:04:09.240
that we've been doing it wrong the whole time.

01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:11.240
We're just going to make you happy.

01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:13.240
This is my world I made for you ladies.

01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:17.240
I think a lot of us have the impulse to be like, hey, I didn't mean to do that

01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:19.240
and we really want to prove it to them, but it's like.

01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:21.240
I didn't mean to call me a slut.

01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:26.240
I just wanted you to know I was, I just like wanted a fair wages.

01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:30.240
I think the fact that someone would bring the point up to you

01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:33.240
is them knowing that you didn't mean to, like they already know that.

01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:35.240
So we get caught in this trap of trying to prove to them

01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:38.240
that like we're a good person who wouldn't intentionally hurt them.

01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:40.240
And it's like that's beside the point to them.

01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:42.240
They're just trying to tell you to stop doing it.

01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:47.240
And it's hard because it every human being shares this.

01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:49.240
I think primatological.

01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:55.240
There is a surf curl or a wind that gets in your sail.

01:04:55.240 --> 01:04:59.240
The moment when you it's self righteousness or just not even self righteousness.

01:04:59.240 --> 01:05:03.240
That sounds pejorative righteousness when you truly are right.

01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:06.240
It's not fabricated that you are right.

01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:09.240
Like that's when we, a lot of us break down.

01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:16.240
I, I, my heroes are people, the people that have changed me are people

01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:21.240
who have been right and have taken mercy on me and been like, Hey man,

01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:24.240
like, like you should know you're wrong and I'm right.

01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:28.240
But like that they like come in somehow lower and I don't know.

01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:31.240
I don't even know how they did it, but like I've had these experiences where I'm like,

01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:35.240
I would have just argued about this shit and like been this way.

01:05:35.240 --> 01:05:40.240
If it weren't for this one person, this anonymous person on Twitter or, or it's some,

01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:44.240
some, some flame war that was like, it's 9 11 everybody.

01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:51.240
Anyway, but, but, but yeah, it's, it's, it's, it's a, it's a dangerous mechanism

01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:58.240
in all of us that we, I think when we feel, when we feel correct, when we feel right,

01:05:58.240 --> 01:06:04.240
we, there's like a Newtonian law there that like puffs us up more and then

01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:09.240
and then it creates this syndrome because when, when you feel wrong, you have a,

01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:13.240
you have a defensive reaction and then when you feel right, you have an aggressive reaction.

01:06:13.240 --> 01:06:16.240
Maybe that's me describing men. I don't think so though.

01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:21.240
I, I have a theory now that we've all been emotionally abused by probably our parents

01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:22.240
or someone.

01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:23.240
I like that theory.

01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:29.240
And then our, our coping mechanism going forward is like it's either fight or flight.

01:06:29.240 --> 01:06:33.240
So in certain situations, we just become the abuser because we're like,

01:06:33.240 --> 01:06:36.240
I'm the right one here. You know, we're, it's a way of taking control.

01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:40.240
I think in chaotic households, which should describe 100% of households,

01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:44.240
even if you think you lived in a beaver cleaver like household, I think you're a kid.

01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:45.240
So it's chaotic.

01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:48.240
I do think it's like, you have these like tyrants who are going to say,

01:06:48.240 --> 01:06:51.240
because I said so and they're going to be like, and I think the moments that we,

01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:56.240
that dopamine spike us and evolve us are the moments we stand up to them and prove them wrong.

01:06:56.240 --> 01:06:58.240
I, I, I at least I should just be for myself.

01:06:58.240 --> 01:06:59.240
I mean, that was my household.

01:06:59.240 --> 01:07:06.240
It was like, I don't, I didn't learn, I didn't like, like learn that the more I could roll

01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:09.240
over the more freedom I got at all.

01:07:09.240 --> 01:07:12.240
Like my curfews got extended by fucking monologues.

01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:19.240
Like, like, like my, my, my posture improved like every, like it was like all my leveling

01:07:19.240 --> 01:07:25.240
up what it had to do with like the moment I finally lost my shit and fucking like proved

01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:30.240
someone wrong, emulating what they, the weapons they would use against me, which were like

01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:34.240
yelling and shaming and toxifying and all that stuff.

01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:38.240
And it's, that's the, that's the, I guess that's what we're all up against is because

01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:43.240
our whole species is descended from a one big dysfunctional family that was reproductively

01:07:43.240 --> 01:07:44.240
successful.

01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:49.240
Like we, we don't give ourselves enough credit biologically for being primate that grew up

01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:55.240
in God's crosshairs and yet beat the fuck out of giraffes and ants.

01:07:55.240 --> 01:08:00.240
We are going to the fucking outer space and, and, and when we do, if you were a good giraffe

01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:04.240
you can come with, we'll think about it.

01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:08.240
It was not a good solution to grow a longer neck because you couldn't reach leaves.

01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:10.240
It's dumb.

01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:12.240
You thought you nailed it.

01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:14.240
You would have fucking eaten us if you had evolved past that.

01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:15.240
You would have fucking eaten us.

01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:17.240
We're eating you.

01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:18.240
You don't even taste good.

01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:22.240
You just got, you're all neck.

01:08:22.240 --> 01:08:24.240
And you can't talk.

01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:26.240
Famous for their necks.

01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:28.240
Can't talk.

01:08:28.240 --> 01:08:30.240
You hate, you hate giraffes so much.

01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:37.240
Somewhere along the line where I'm growing a longer neck, maybe I should add some larynxes

01:08:37.240 --> 01:08:45.240
so I could say, hey, anyone have any ideas about how to build a ladder?

01:08:45.240 --> 01:08:51.240
It's laziness. We, what my point is, we don't earn this through our choices every day.

01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:54.240
Have you ever met a giraffe? Have you ever been in the company of one?

01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:58.240
Don't interrupt me. It irritates me.

01:08:58.240 --> 01:09:04.240
We, we didn't earn any of this, but it also is recognizable.

01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:11.240
Like, as a species, we fucking like, we, we are the biggest success on the planet until

01:09:11.240 --> 01:09:15.240
you get to the part where we're so successful that the planet may then fail.

01:09:15.240 --> 01:09:21.240
But like, as individual human beings, then we don't, fuck, I had it.

01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:25.240
I fucking had it. I had the meaning of life right in my fucking hand.

01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:26.240
God damn it.

01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:30.240
I want my tail back if we're so successful.

01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:34.240
We lost tails because we got so big in fact because we were like fucking nailing it.

01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:36.240
We used to be like squirrels.

01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:42.240
You just, if you back us up all the way to assuming we all came from one amoeba, we represent

01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:45.240
the part of that amoeba's family that was like peace.

01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:47.240
Like, we're awesome.

01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:52.240
See, and all the other fucking amoeba siblings are like, well, I'll think I'll be an amoeba

01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:55.240
that grows an amoeba shirt.

01:09:55.240 --> 01:09:58.240
And we were like, I think I'll be a fucking monkey.

01:09:58.240 --> 01:10:01.240
And they're like, you think you're better than me now?

01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:03.240
Fucking smart amoeba.

01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:07.240
I don't want the tail. I don't want the tail. I want that toe thumb where you can fucking

01:10:07.240 --> 01:10:09.240
grab on to shit with your foot.

01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:11.240
And super strength.

01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:12.240
Remember that shit?

01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:15.240
You can just fucking hang out upside down and be like, I'm fine like this.

01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:18.240
Oh yeah, we had one. Here's what it doesn't protect you from.

01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:23.240
Your cousin's becoming nuclear capable.

01:10:23.240 --> 01:10:27.240
Sorry, toe thumb.

01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:28.240
I've got.

01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:29.240
Why are those mutually exclusive?

01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:33.240
Why can't I be good at nuclear physics and also have a toe thumb?

01:10:33.240 --> 01:10:36.240
Turns out you can't.

01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:41.240
If we don't blow ourselves up, we may get to a point where we can upload our consciousness

01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:43.240
into a simulation of having toe thumbs.

01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:46.240
We're almost there. We're almost there.

01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:51.240
We just got a couple more little conniption fits to get through.

01:10:51.240 --> 01:10:54.240
God, I swear to God, I had a fucking point.

01:10:54.240 --> 01:10:57.240
I was going to stitch the giraffe thing to a thing.

01:10:57.240 --> 01:10:59.240
It was going to blow your mind.

01:10:59.240 --> 01:11:03.240
You were mad about giraffes because they got it wrong and they should have had a ladder.

01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:05.240
Yeah, and why I know that.

01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:09.240
No, he's right about the ladder part. That part was great.

01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:13.240
Now, what I was saying before that was, it was harping about something that I was like,

01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:17.240
like then I got off on this thing that I'm like, I've said a thousand times, but I was like.

01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:19.240
All right, so.

01:11:19.240 --> 01:11:21.240
We should build a wall.

01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:22.240
We should build a wall.

01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:24.240
Did you see the photo of the guy and that's the wall?

01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:27.240
All right, anyways.

01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:31.240
You're going to want those giraffes on the wall when the wall happens, man.

01:11:31.240 --> 01:11:42.240
You're going to need someone to fucking see what's going on the other side.

01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:46.240
You're going to fucking eat your fucking words about giraffes.

01:11:46.240 --> 01:11:48.240
You remember Gladiator?

01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:53.240
They have a shot where you can see your giraffes like being loaded into the Colosseum's loading dock,

01:11:53.240 --> 01:11:56.240
but they don't have the scene where people are like killing giraffes,

01:11:56.240 --> 01:12:00.240
which is what they used to do because they were like, holy shit, look at these monsters with long necks.

01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:05.240
We should have eight of them fight Doug.

01:12:05.240 --> 01:12:08.240
And Doug would be like, yeah, yeah.

01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:12.240
And the giraffes would be like, are you fucking kidding me?

01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:14.240
I got a long neck here.

01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:15.240
I did everything I'm supposed to do.

01:12:15.240 --> 01:12:17.240
I'm not a horse for God's sake.

01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:19.240
I got a long neck.

01:12:19.240 --> 01:12:23.240
And we're like, we have bronze, you're dead, and it's not fair to you.

01:12:23.240 --> 01:12:25.240
A giraffe will fuck you up or kick you.

01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:27.240
They'll fucking wrap you with their head.

01:12:27.240 --> 01:12:28.240
They don't fuck about.

01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:30.240
You know, you don't want to fight a zebra.

01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:32.240
A zebra will fucking get you.

01:12:32.240 --> 01:12:33.240
Look, everything will get me.

01:12:33.240 --> 01:12:34.240
A giraffe would kick my ass.

01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:37.240
I'm not a Gladiator.

01:12:37.240 --> 01:12:41.240
I wouldn't want to be in a ring with a giraffe even with a sword.

01:12:41.240 --> 01:12:43.240
He's going to walk on your face.

01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:45.240
I don't want to.

01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:49.240
Who do you want to be in a ring with a sword with?

01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:50.240
Crocodile.

01:12:50.240 --> 01:13:00.240
Just say if you had said a feminist parody news site editors.

01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:01.240
Why would I say that?

01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:05.240
Because our podcast would have taken a huge turn for clicks.

01:13:05.240 --> 01:13:06.240
It would have been amazing.

01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:08.240
If I said I wanted to kill feminists.

01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:09.240
It would have gotten you a wooden sword.

01:13:09.240 --> 01:13:10.240
It would have gone into it.

01:13:10.240 --> 01:13:12.240
It would have been a huge charity event.

01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:13.240
Here's what I would do.

01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:17.240
If I could go back in time, if I could be in a ring with anybody with an actual sword,

01:13:17.240 --> 01:13:20.240
Nero, who used to make people fight him with fake swords.

01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:22.240
It's like, no, fight me with a real sword.

01:13:22.240 --> 01:13:24.240
You piece of shit.

01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:30.240
What about an ugly sex robot?

01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:34.240
I would fuck a sex robot that looked like David Lee Roth.

01:13:34.240 --> 01:13:38.240
Just because...

01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:40.240
Just for that.

01:13:40.240 --> 01:13:45.240
I brought my pencil.

01:13:45.240 --> 01:13:49.240
Hey, man, you came on my face.

01:13:49.240 --> 01:13:53.240
I would do it just for that.

01:13:53.240 --> 01:13:56.240
It was just like a sound board, like a ways thing.

01:13:56.240 --> 01:14:01.240
Oh, you had a shack one where it's like, why would you scum my face?

01:14:01.240 --> 01:14:04.240
Ease the seat back.

01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:09.240
My friend Matt Young thought the lyrics were,

01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:11.240
I can barely see the roads, all the heat coming off it.

01:14:11.240 --> 01:14:13.240
Reach down between my legs.

01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:15.240
Ease the seat back.

01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:18.240
He thought it was ease the seat back.

01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:23.240
So David Lee Roth is a farmer on a tractor in his mind.

01:14:23.240 --> 01:14:25.240
Ease the seat back.

01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:27.240
Wave to Yahshua.

01:14:27.240 --> 01:14:30.240
I reached down between my legs and ease the seat back.

01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:33.240
I was like, you thought that was on the fucking air on the radio?

01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:35.240
I showed you guys today for the longest time.

01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:38.240
I don't know when I figured out that it wasn't the case.

01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:43.240
But the phrase blow your wad was exclusively sexual

01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:46.240
and was so grossed out that mainstream media would just use it

01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:51.240
that CNN would go like, oh, the Clinton campaign may have blown its wad on the thing.

01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:54.240
I'd be like, gross, what are you talking about?

01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:56.240
Jipe on a thing.

01:14:56.240 --> 01:14:57.240
What?

01:14:57.240 --> 01:15:02.240
And then I realized it's like, oh, it's like a wad of cash.

01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:07.240
I was like, how are people saying blow your wad all the time?

01:15:07.240 --> 01:15:08.240
It's so gross.

01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:09.240
It's like pearl jam.

01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:12.240
And you can learn what pearl jam is and you're like, gross, stop it.

01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:13.240
What do you eat?

01:15:13.240 --> 01:15:15.240
I have to hear your name all the time.

01:15:15.240 --> 01:15:17.240
Wait, wait, what the fuck?

01:15:17.240 --> 01:15:18.240
Pearl jam is...

01:15:18.240 --> 01:15:19.240
What is...

01:15:19.240 --> 01:15:20.240
No, that's pearl neck.

01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:21.240
Not that I know.

01:15:21.240 --> 01:15:22.240
Well, it's...

01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:23.240
No, well, no.

01:15:23.240 --> 01:15:27.240
I gestured to my decolletage, but I...

01:15:27.240 --> 01:15:28.240
No, that's even...

01:15:28.240 --> 01:15:29.240
It's even grosser.

01:15:29.240 --> 01:15:30.240
Pearl jam.

01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:31.240
It's fucking...

01:15:31.240 --> 01:15:32.240
Yeah, pearl jam.

01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:33.240
Gross.

01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:36.240
You mean somebody takes, come and puts it in a jar and makes jam?

01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:37.240
Is that an actual...

01:15:37.240 --> 01:15:40.240
No, it's a way of referring to your fucking gross, pearly cum.

01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:42.240
Is that an actual thing?

01:15:42.240 --> 01:15:43.240
Are you making that up?

01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:45.240
They don't like it.

01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:50.240
It's a bit.

01:15:50.240 --> 01:15:56.240
Check this motherfucker for a suicide vest.

01:15:56.240 --> 01:16:00.240
Don't you never stand up in a comedy show like that.

01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:01.240
Check him for a vest.

01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:02.240
Is that a vest?

01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:03.240
Yeah, it's a vest.

01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:04.240
I should...

01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:05.240
Please don't kill us.

01:16:05.240 --> 01:16:06.240
All right.

01:16:06.240 --> 01:16:07.240
Thank you, Abba.

01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:10.240
Thank you for saving pearl jam for me and everyone in this room.

01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:12.240
You thought pearl jam was a cum reference?

01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:13.240
I really...

01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:14.240
Maybe I projected that?

01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:18.240
Did I come up with a name for cum and like make it pearl jam's fault?

01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:19.240
I think you did.

01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:20.240
All right.

01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:21.240
I accept that.

01:16:21.240 --> 01:16:22.240
I mean...

01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:25.240
I was like, what the fuck do I not know about?

01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:29.240
You would never spread pearl jam on toast?

01:16:29.240 --> 01:16:31.240
Well, I'm not ashamed of that projection.

01:16:31.240 --> 01:16:33.240
That just makes me imagine it of like Vonokin or something.

01:16:33.240 --> 01:16:36.240
I didn't like market it.

01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:39.240
But the important thing is, Abba, thank you.

01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:44.240
Pearl jam, if you're listening, you're off the hook.

01:16:44.240 --> 01:16:48.240
That ant story to me sounds like something they just said in interviews in the 90s.

01:16:48.240 --> 01:16:49.240
What was the ant story?

01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:50.240
I wasn't even listening.

01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:52.240
All I heard was that it was wrong.

01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:54.240
That their ant pearl made really good jam.

01:16:54.240 --> 01:16:55.240
Oh.

01:16:55.240 --> 01:16:57.240
They made a good jam, so they call it pearl jam.

01:16:57.240 --> 01:16:58.240
But then...

01:16:58.240 --> 01:16:59.240
Okay, so...

01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:00.240
All right.

01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:01.240
Yeah, you're right.

01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:04.240
So they could explain their name in interviews.

01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:05.240
Yeah.

01:17:05.240 --> 01:17:06.240
All right.

01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:07.240
All right.

01:17:07.240 --> 01:17:10.240
Also, yeah, the Beatles said they were losing this guy with diamonds, wasn't LSD or some

01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:11.240
other shit.

01:17:11.240 --> 01:17:12.240
Yeah.

01:17:12.240 --> 01:17:15.240
And ant limp just made really good biscuits.

01:17:15.240 --> 01:17:16.240
No.

01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:20.240
Wait, what does limp biscuit mean?

01:17:20.240 --> 01:17:22.240
Is that a reference to something sexual?

01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:23.240
No.

01:17:23.240 --> 01:17:24.240
What is limp biscuit?

01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:32.240
Do you have to put some people that jerk off on a biscuit and then one person can't jerk

01:17:32.240 --> 01:17:33.240
off on a biscuit?

01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:34.240
Jesus.

01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:35.240
What?

01:17:35.240 --> 01:17:38.740
I don't understand how the ordinary world in that Campbellian journey is a bunch of people

01:17:38.740 --> 01:17:40.240
jerking off on a biscuit.

01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:41.240
Right?

01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:44.240
And then you had to make up a phrase for when that fails.

01:17:44.240 --> 01:17:45.240
Yeah.

01:17:45.240 --> 01:17:50.240
It seems like if everybody successfully jerked off on a biscuit, the biscuit would become limp.

01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:53.240
But you're saying that the guy that can't keep it up...

01:17:53.240 --> 01:17:54.240
Jerk off is the winner.

01:17:54.240 --> 01:17:55.240
He's the limpest.

01:17:55.240 --> 01:17:56.240
He's the winner?

01:17:56.240 --> 01:17:58.240
There are no winners.

01:17:58.240 --> 01:18:00.240
He has to eat it.

01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:02.240
He's got to eat the biscuit.

01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:04.240
You don't get great in that biscuit?

01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:07.240
A little of my aunt's pearl jam.

01:18:07.240 --> 01:18:11.740
I always thought limp biscuit is the worst thing you can hear right before a dude punches

01:18:11.740 --> 01:18:14.240
you in the mouth.

01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:19.240
That's how you know you're about to get into a fight when a white dude is like, limp biscuit!

01:18:19.240 --> 01:18:24.240
You're like, no!

01:18:24.240 --> 01:18:25.240
So fucking embarrassing.

01:18:25.240 --> 01:18:28.240
I don't want to hear limp biscuit or Smash Mouth under any circumstances.

01:18:28.240 --> 01:18:29.240
Right.

01:18:29.240 --> 01:18:34.240
I'd rather have my ass beat to journey.

01:18:34.240 --> 01:18:37.240
Just a small town girl.

01:18:37.240 --> 01:18:39.240
You can fuck me up to faithfully.

01:18:39.240 --> 01:18:44.240
You can hold me forever to faithfully and just...

01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:46.240
What's faithfully?

01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:49.240
I'm forever yours.

01:18:49.240 --> 01:18:50.240
Right?

01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:51.240
Keep going.

01:18:51.240 --> 01:18:53.240
It's also about semen.

01:18:53.240 --> 01:18:54.240
What band is that?

01:18:54.240 --> 01:18:55.240
Journey.

01:18:55.240 --> 01:18:56.240
Wait.

01:18:56.240 --> 01:18:58.240
How do I not know a journey song?

01:18:58.240 --> 01:18:59.240
Faithfully.

01:18:59.240 --> 01:19:01.240
They ain't fucking from Missouri.

01:19:01.240 --> 01:19:02.240
All I think of is...

01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:03.240
That's not open arms.

01:19:03.240 --> 01:19:06.240
You know what journey means.

01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:14.240
That's what you poop on somebody's chest.

01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:16.240
It all means...

01:19:16.240 --> 01:19:17.240
What have we found out tonight?

01:19:17.240 --> 01:19:18.240
All of our favorite bands.

01:19:18.240 --> 01:19:22.240
Tory Amos means come.

01:19:22.240 --> 01:19:24.240
So are you guys...

01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:30.240
You guys forgive my ignorance, but are you guys here because just because you're awesome

01:19:30.240 --> 01:19:33.240
or are you also maybe moving to feral audio with a podcast?

01:19:33.240 --> 01:19:34.240
Yeah.

01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:35.240
All right.

01:19:35.240 --> 01:19:36.240
Yeah.

01:19:36.240 --> 01:19:40.240
You can check out our podcast, Mouth Time.

01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:44.240
And if you're in town tomorrow, we have a show at the Comedy Store at 8 p.m.

01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:45.240
It's gonna be awesome.

01:19:45.240 --> 01:19:46.240
Yep.

01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:48.240
What's the podcast called?

01:19:48.240 --> 01:19:49.240
Mouth Time.

01:19:49.240 --> 01:19:50.240
Mouth Time.

01:19:50.240 --> 01:19:51.240
Yeah.

01:19:51.240 --> 01:19:54.240
That sounds more like Pearl Jam.

01:19:54.240 --> 01:19:56.240
Oh, it's definitely about semen.

01:19:56.240 --> 01:19:58.240
I mean, this is undeniably.

01:19:58.240 --> 01:19:59.240
What isn't?

01:19:59.240 --> 01:20:02.240
When can we stop denying everything is, is?

01:20:02.240 --> 01:20:04.240
The time we stop denying everything is.

01:20:04.240 --> 01:20:09.240
I gotta get my grammar right because otherwise I'll never become president.

01:20:09.240 --> 01:20:15.240
What is Mouth Time about?

01:20:15.240 --> 01:20:17.240
What's the angle on Mouth Time?

01:20:17.240 --> 01:20:22.240
It was kind of inspired by a particular women's magazine podcast.

01:20:22.240 --> 01:20:28.240
So it's hosted by two of the editors of Reductress in the world of Reductress.

01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:31.240
A parody of entertainment podcasts.

01:20:31.240 --> 01:20:32.240
Yeah.

01:20:32.240 --> 01:20:33.240
I love it.

01:20:33.240 --> 01:20:34.240
Killer pitch.

01:20:34.240 --> 01:20:35.240
I know.

01:20:35.240 --> 01:20:40.240
And you guys are already, wait, but how long have you been doing it?

01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:41.240
Almost a year.

01:20:41.240 --> 01:20:42.240
Okay.

01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:46.240
And so you're, you're, but it's usually in studio, not with an audience.

01:20:46.240 --> 01:20:50.240
We've done a couple live podcasts, but we usually record it in the office.

01:20:50.240 --> 01:20:52.240
But you're doing a live one this coming.

01:20:52.240 --> 01:20:53.240
I just want to make sure people can show it.

01:20:53.240 --> 01:20:56.240
Oh, the show at the Comedy Store is a standup, standup variety show.

01:20:56.240 --> 01:20:58.240
We've got some great people on board.

01:20:58.240 --> 01:21:02.240
Ray at Butcher's performing, Eliza Skinner, Dolce Sloan, Amanda Seals.

01:21:02.240 --> 01:21:03.240
Yeah.

01:21:03.240 --> 01:21:04.240
Okay.

01:21:04.240 --> 01:21:05.240
That whole thing.

01:21:05.240 --> 01:21:06.240
Okay.

01:21:06.240 --> 01:21:08.240
So yeah, and I'm just making sure everybody has the information they need to go there

01:21:08.240 --> 01:21:10.240
in case it's not sold out.

01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:14.240
But, and then, and then after, and then, so you'll be on Ferrell Audio after that.

01:21:14.240 --> 01:21:16.240
And that's easy enough to just look up.

01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:17.240
Yes.

01:21:17.240 --> 01:21:18.240
Hmm.

01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:19.240
Hmm.

01:21:19.240 --> 01:21:21.240
Well, let me see.

01:21:21.240 --> 01:21:22.240
Hmm.

01:21:22.240 --> 01:21:28.240
Did you guys know that the H in ADD is just, it's just, they just added it.

01:21:28.240 --> 01:21:32.240
Where is this members only jacket I heard so much about from the future?

01:21:32.240 --> 01:21:33.240
I think that kid left.

01:21:33.240 --> 01:21:34.240
Oh, did he split?

01:21:34.240 --> 01:21:36.240
Oh, he moved, he moved chairs.

01:21:36.240 --> 01:21:37.240
He moved.

01:21:37.240 --> 01:21:38.240
All right.

01:21:38.240 --> 01:21:42.240
In an effort to, like, he's like, give me my life back.

01:21:42.240 --> 01:21:43.240
We found him.

01:21:43.240 --> 01:21:45.240
Hey, what's your name, brother?

01:21:45.240 --> 01:21:46.240
We met you before and I forgot your name.

01:21:46.240 --> 01:21:47.240
Lucas.

01:21:47.240 --> 01:21:51.240
Lucas, you have a gift bag for Dan and Spencer, I see.

01:21:51.240 --> 01:21:52.240
Yeah.

01:21:52.240 --> 01:21:56.240
Oh, is this Lucas, the tall guy that we ridiculed for your height?

01:21:56.240 --> 01:21:57.240
Oh, yeah.

01:21:57.240 --> 01:21:59.240
And you were such a good sport.

01:21:59.240 --> 01:22:03.240
I listened to that by the way, I was as much as we were self-effacing about how we were

01:22:03.240 --> 01:22:04.240
just mocking you for your height.

01:22:04.240 --> 01:22:05.240
I listened back to it.

01:22:05.240 --> 01:22:07.240
I was like, holy shit, this is a thing.

01:22:07.240 --> 01:22:11.240
Like we really just like, I mentioned I was a painter when I was on and I painted you

01:22:11.240 --> 01:22:12.240
and Spencer.

01:22:12.240 --> 01:22:13.240
Oh, shit.

01:22:13.240 --> 01:22:14.240
Thank you.

01:22:14.240 --> 01:22:15.240
That's a lot of your painting.

01:22:15.240 --> 01:22:16.240
So I figured that I would.

01:22:16.240 --> 01:22:21.240
I mean, are you, is it okay if I unveil it?

01:22:21.240 --> 01:22:23.240
Feel free to show people.

01:22:23.240 --> 01:22:24.240
It's Minecraft.

01:22:24.240 --> 01:22:25.240
It's Minecraft.

01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:26.240
It's a Minecraft themed painting.

01:22:26.240 --> 01:22:29.240
I didn't know what video games you liked, so.

01:22:29.240 --> 01:22:30.240
Yeah.

01:22:30.240 --> 01:22:32.240
There's one in there for Spencer too.

01:22:32.240 --> 01:22:33.240
Awesome.

01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:34.240
Thanks so much.

01:22:34.240 --> 01:22:35.240
Yeah, no problem.

01:22:35.240 --> 01:22:36.240
I missed you last time, right?

01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:37.240
I was gone.

01:22:37.240 --> 01:22:38.240
Yeah, you weren't there.

01:22:38.240 --> 01:22:39.240
Yeah.

01:22:39.240 --> 01:22:40.240
Hi.

01:22:40.240 --> 01:22:42.240
I didn't have one for Jeff.

01:22:42.240 --> 01:22:43.240
That's okay.

01:22:43.240 --> 01:22:44.240
Next time.

01:22:44.240 --> 01:22:45.240
What video games do you like?

01:22:45.240 --> 01:22:46.240
Pardon?

01:22:46.240 --> 01:22:48.240
What video games do you like?

01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:50.240
I'm pretty heavy into Candy Crush.

01:22:50.240 --> 01:22:51.240
Okay.

01:22:51.240 --> 01:22:52.240
Yeah.

01:22:52.240 --> 01:22:53.240
Great.

01:22:53.240 --> 01:22:54.240
I'll paint you some candy.

01:22:54.240 --> 01:22:55.240
Jelly.

01:22:55.240 --> 01:22:56.240
Okay.

01:22:56.240 --> 01:22:57.240
Do you have a site?

01:22:57.240 --> 01:22:58.240
Where can we see it?

01:22:58.240 --> 01:22:59.240
I have an Instagram.

01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:00.240
King Lucas Lee.

01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:01.240
King Lucas Lee.

01:23:01.240 --> 01:23:02.240
Yeah.

01:23:02.240 --> 01:23:05.240
K-I-N-G-L-U-C-A-S-L-E-E.

01:23:05.240 --> 01:23:06.240
Correct.

01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:07.240
With underscores in between the words.

01:23:07.240 --> 01:23:08.240
Can you use it in a sense?

01:23:08.240 --> 01:23:09.240
With underscores in between.

01:23:09.240 --> 01:23:10.240
That's important.

01:23:10.240 --> 01:23:11.240
Yeah.

01:23:11.240 --> 01:23:13.240
It's great on me for knowing how to spell comic names.

01:23:13.240 --> 01:23:14.240
Yeah.

01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:15.240
The important thing is, okay.

01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:18.240
Sometimes people spell it with a K, which is Lucas with a K.

01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:19.240
Oh, yeah.

01:23:19.240 --> 01:23:20.240
I don't know.

01:23:20.240 --> 01:23:21.240
It's crazy.

01:23:21.240 --> 01:23:24.240
Well, maybe you're so tall, they think you're like Slenderman.

01:23:24.240 --> 01:23:26.240
I have been Slenderman for Halloween before.

01:23:26.240 --> 01:23:27.240
It's good.

01:23:27.240 --> 01:23:28.240
It scares people.

01:23:28.240 --> 01:23:29.240
Yeah.

01:23:29.240 --> 01:23:30.240
Have you seen...

01:23:30.240 --> 01:23:31.240
I'm standing right in front of you guys.

01:23:31.240 --> 01:23:32.240
I'll stand in front of you.

01:23:32.240 --> 01:23:33.240
You can sit back down.

01:23:33.240 --> 01:23:34.240
I'm okay.

01:23:34.240 --> 01:23:35.240
Yeah.

01:23:35.240 --> 01:23:39.240
Dan was asking me questions and I...

01:23:39.240 --> 01:23:40.240
Yeah.

01:23:40.240 --> 01:23:41.240
Lucas, Park it.

01:23:41.240 --> 01:23:42.240
Have a seat.

01:23:42.240 --> 01:23:43.240
Have a seat.

01:23:43.240 --> 01:23:44.240
Sit on my lap.

01:23:44.240 --> 01:23:45.240
Okay.

01:23:45.240 --> 01:23:46.240
Nope.

01:23:46.240 --> 01:23:48.240
You should have to say what you want.

01:23:48.240 --> 01:23:49.240
Yeah.

01:23:49.240 --> 01:23:53.240
Well, I can stand up if you want.

01:23:53.240 --> 01:23:54.240
No, yeah.

01:23:54.240 --> 01:23:55.240
Okay, great.

01:23:55.240 --> 01:24:01.240
In addition to making us paintings, yeah, how is your life going?

01:24:01.240 --> 01:24:03.240
Let's make your life a serialized drama.

01:24:03.240 --> 01:24:04.240
Okay.

01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:07.240
Well, Christmas ended, so I don't have a job anymore.

01:24:07.240 --> 01:24:08.240
Oh, because of the...

01:24:08.240 --> 01:24:12.240
Of course, Santa's such a tall character.

01:24:12.240 --> 01:24:15.240
I was a who at Universal Studios.

01:24:15.240 --> 01:24:16.240
Oh, right.

01:24:16.240 --> 01:24:17.240
So, for Grinchmas.

01:24:17.240 --> 01:24:18.240
Oh, really?

01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:19.240
And they just kick you in the street?

01:24:19.240 --> 01:24:20.240
Yeah.

01:24:20.240 --> 01:24:21.240
They're just like, get out.

01:24:21.240 --> 01:24:22.240
Yeah.

01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:26.240
I don't want to be hightest, but you would be a perfect Frankenstein there because...

01:24:26.240 --> 01:24:27.240
Too tall.

01:24:27.240 --> 01:24:28.240
Too tall for Frankenstein?

01:24:28.240 --> 01:24:32.240
Because he wears platform shoes, so he is the same height as me.

01:24:32.240 --> 01:24:33.240
But you'd be 11 feet tall.

01:24:33.240 --> 01:24:34.240
Yeah, exactly.

01:24:34.240 --> 01:24:36.240
Because it becomes an FAA issue.

01:24:36.240 --> 01:24:37.240
Yeah.

01:24:37.240 --> 01:24:41.240
I got to be Frankenstein there once and it was the best gig in the world because you

01:24:41.240 --> 01:24:43.240
get to wear a suit and a mask and nobody...

01:24:43.240 --> 01:24:44.240
Nobody knows who you are, yeah.

01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:47.240
Nobody fucks with you because you're horrifying, but yeah, you would be...

01:24:47.240 --> 01:24:49.240
No one fucks with me anyway because I'm horrifying.

01:24:49.240 --> 01:24:50.240
Exactly.

01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:51.240
I'm 6'9".

01:24:51.240 --> 01:24:52.240
But you don't...

01:24:52.240 --> 01:24:53.240
You're not like...

01:24:53.240 --> 01:24:55.240
You're like Stephen Merchant.

01:24:55.240 --> 01:24:58.240
Yeah, you called me Stephen Merchant last episode.

01:24:58.240 --> 01:25:00.240
Yeah, I mean, well, there you go.

01:25:00.240 --> 01:25:02.240
That's what everyone's calling you in their head then.

01:25:02.240 --> 01:25:03.240
Yeah.

01:25:03.240 --> 01:25:06.240
If I don't have my finger on the pools of the people, I don't know who does.

01:25:06.240 --> 01:25:07.240
Well...

01:25:07.240 --> 01:25:10.240
Right now, you're giving Reductress the best lap dance of the world.

01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:11.240
Yeah, I know, right?

01:25:11.240 --> 01:25:12.240
It's so still.

01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:13.240
I'm sorry.

01:25:13.240 --> 01:25:14.240
Yeah, oh no, you're very thin.

01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:15.240
I feel nothing.

01:25:15.240 --> 01:25:16.240
Yeah.

01:25:16.240 --> 01:25:17.240
It's...

01:25:17.240 --> 01:25:18.240
Yeah.

01:25:18.240 --> 01:25:19.240
I wouldn't like smell bad.

01:25:19.240 --> 01:25:20.240
I'm just like...

01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:21.240
All right.

01:25:21.240 --> 01:25:22.240
Well, all right.

01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:23.240
Well, I guess...

01:25:23.240 --> 01:25:24.240
I'll sit down.

01:25:24.240 --> 01:25:25.240
Lucas, I'll sit down.

01:25:25.240 --> 01:25:26.240
All right.

01:25:26.240 --> 01:25:27.240
Get off our guests.

01:25:27.240 --> 01:25:28.240
Lucas, everybody.

01:25:28.240 --> 01:25:29.240
Woo!

01:25:29.240 --> 01:25:32.240
It's nicer when it's their idea to sit down.

01:25:32.240 --> 01:25:33.240
It makes me feel more comfortable.

01:25:33.240 --> 01:25:34.240
I feel like I...

01:25:34.240 --> 01:25:35.240
You did great.

01:25:35.240 --> 01:25:36.240
Thank you.

01:25:36.240 --> 01:25:37.240
You have great company.

01:25:37.240 --> 01:25:38.240
All right.

01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:40.240
When people come over, you're always so nice.

01:25:40.240 --> 01:25:45.240
What have you been up to, Brandon?

01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:46.240
Man, I'm just...

01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:51.240
I got these bootlegs of this podcast on Fero.

01:25:51.240 --> 01:25:55.240
So if you guys want to get that shit, then I'm selling that after this show.

01:25:55.240 --> 01:25:58.640
Are you doing Lucifer Vom coming up for...

01:25:58.640 --> 01:26:00.040
I'm not doing Lucifer Vom.

01:26:00.040 --> 01:26:02.040
I wish I was, but please go check out Lucifer Vom.

01:26:02.040 --> 01:26:04.840
It's fucking L.A.'s greatest gift to itself.

01:26:04.840 --> 01:26:07.840
You got to see Brandon as a character.

01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:09.240
Was there a name for that character?

01:26:09.240 --> 01:26:13.000
I said he was Father Greasy Dick, which is a real...

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:16.240
Which is a real fucking Catholic name in St. Louis.

01:26:16.240 --> 01:26:17.240
You live in Greasy Dick Hall.

01:26:17.240 --> 01:26:18.240
Are you from St. Louis?

01:26:18.240 --> 01:26:21.000
Why are you nodding at me, man?

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
Oh, because you can't.

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
There's not a real Greasy Dick Hall.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:30.080
There's a real Greasy Dick Hall in St. Louis of all places.

01:26:30.080 --> 01:26:32.340
And it's a Catholic parish, or no?

01:26:32.340 --> 01:26:35.000
It's a Catholic university called St. Louis University.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:36.000
Greasy Dick Hall.

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:37.000
Greasy Dick Hall.

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
How do you spell that?

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:42.880
G-R-E-I-S-D-I-C-H.

01:26:42.880 --> 01:26:43.880
Something like that.

01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:48.880
Or B-R-A-N-D-O-N.

01:26:48.880 --> 01:26:53.880
Never ask me what I'm up to.

01:26:53.880 --> 01:26:59.880
The real truth is looking for a cheap vape.

01:26:59.880 --> 01:27:02.880
I'm going to accept that as the answer.

01:27:02.880 --> 01:27:03.880
Oh, shit.

01:27:03.880 --> 01:27:04.880
Yeah.

01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:05.880
Uh-oh.

01:27:05.880 --> 01:27:06.880
Oh, no.

01:27:06.880 --> 01:27:07.880
Okay.

01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:11.880
It's about that time, the time that I'm getting nervous

01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:14.880
that we don't have an ending.

01:27:14.880 --> 01:27:19.880
So I'll literally change the pitch of my voice.

01:27:19.880 --> 01:27:20.880
That's awesome.

01:27:20.880 --> 01:27:23.880
Why do I allow myself to take on a slight urban patois

01:27:23.880 --> 01:27:28.880
as long as it's being filtered through a base enhancing device?

01:27:28.880 --> 01:27:32.880
I'm going to call myself out on that.

01:27:32.880 --> 01:27:36.880
Do any white people have white friends

01:27:36.880 --> 01:27:41.880
that when they talk to any black person,

01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:44.880
they uncontrollably affect a little slight urban...

01:27:44.880 --> 01:27:46.880
What are you talking about?

01:27:46.880 --> 01:27:47.880
Hey.

01:27:47.880 --> 01:27:49.880
And it doesn't matter who they are.

01:27:49.880 --> 01:27:51.880
It doesn't matter what...

01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:53.880
They just...

01:27:53.880 --> 01:27:56.880
Your friends Stevens are gone.

01:27:56.880 --> 01:27:59.880
And I always say, I have such social anxiety,

01:27:59.880 --> 01:28:01.880
I'm like, oh my god, what are you doing?

01:28:01.880 --> 01:28:02.880
Stop.

01:28:02.880 --> 01:28:03.880
What are you doing?

01:28:03.880 --> 01:28:04.880
We love it.

01:28:04.880 --> 01:28:05.880
Everybody should do it.

01:28:05.880 --> 01:28:07.880
It's a natural thing that every person does.

01:28:07.880 --> 01:28:09.880
It is natural, right?

01:28:09.880 --> 01:28:10.880
It's natural.

01:28:10.880 --> 01:28:12.880
It's the way you say, I'm hearing you,

01:28:12.880 --> 01:28:14.880
I agree with you, I want to be on good terms with you.

01:28:14.880 --> 01:28:16.880
Because if you start to hard army

01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:18.880
when I'm like chilling with you,

01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:24.880
then I'm like, how come you ain't being a cool officer?

01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:26.880
We were talking about blunts and shit

01:28:26.880 --> 01:28:29.880
and you never were like, yeah, you're always like, yes.

01:28:29.880 --> 01:28:30.880
That's not...

01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:32.880
So I think it's a good thing, maybe.

01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:34.880
I think it's you trying to reach out in your own...

01:28:34.880 --> 01:28:36.880
That agreement is how we learn language,

01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:38.880
it's how we mimic each other

01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:40.880
because it's how we socially agree with each other.

01:28:40.880 --> 01:28:43.880
Well, here's what I try to do when I talk to African-Americans.

01:28:47.880 --> 01:28:48.880
Woo!

01:28:48.880 --> 01:28:49.880
What just happened?

01:28:49.880 --> 01:28:50.880
Why y'all do this to me?

01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:51.880
Turn it off!

01:28:51.880 --> 01:28:52.880
Yeah.

01:28:52.880 --> 01:28:53.880
Yeah.

01:28:53.880 --> 01:28:54.880
Yeah.

01:28:54.880 --> 01:28:55.880
Yeah.

01:28:55.880 --> 01:28:56.880
Yeah.

01:28:56.880 --> 01:28:57.880
Yeah.

01:28:57.880 --> 01:29:00.880
I try to be myself.

01:29:00.880 --> 01:29:03.880
I don't try to be someone else.

01:29:03.880 --> 01:29:07.880
I try to be myself.

01:29:07.880 --> 01:29:11.880
I try to be someone else.

01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:12.880
So my name is...

01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:13.880
Who is that?

01:29:13.880 --> 01:29:14.880
Who is that?

01:29:14.880 --> 01:29:15.880
Who is that?

01:29:15.880 --> 01:29:16.880
It's me.

01:29:16.880 --> 01:29:17.880
It's me.

01:29:17.880 --> 01:29:18.880
It's just me.

01:29:18.880 --> 01:29:19.880
You may be black.

01:29:19.880 --> 01:29:21.880
I just talk like this.

01:29:21.880 --> 01:29:22.880
You may be brown.

01:29:22.880 --> 01:29:25.880
I just talk like this.

01:29:25.880 --> 01:29:30.880
You may be a woman and I talk like this.

01:29:30.880 --> 01:29:33.880
But I'm not changing for you.

01:29:33.880 --> 01:29:35.880
I'm just showing you all I can do,

01:29:35.880 --> 01:29:40.880
like break your body down to break it down.

01:29:40.880 --> 01:29:41.880
Who is that?

01:29:41.880 --> 01:29:42.880
Who is that?

01:29:42.880 --> 01:29:43.880
Who is that?

01:29:43.880 --> 01:29:44.880
At the front lawn.

01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:45.880
Who is that?

01:29:45.880 --> 01:29:46.880
Who is that?

01:29:46.880 --> 01:29:47.880
Who is that?

01:29:47.880 --> 01:29:48.880
Bouda!

01:29:48.880 --> 01:29:49.880
Ha!

01:29:49.880 --> 01:29:50.880
Who is that?

01:29:50.880 --> 01:29:51.880
Who is that?

01:29:51.880 --> 01:29:52.880
I don't watch you car with my doll.

01:29:52.880 --> 01:29:54.880
It's so soft like a chamois.

01:29:54.880 --> 01:29:57.380
Go to South Miami.

01:29:57.380 --> 01:29:58.880
Fuck you, Grammy.

01:29:58.880 --> 01:30:01.680
I went a grammy for your mammy

01:30:01.680 --> 01:30:02.680
Fuck your mammy

01:30:02.680 --> 01:30:05.640
Fuck your mammy, I'm a shammy dick

01:30:05.640 --> 01:30:06.640
Take it Brandon

01:30:06.640 --> 01:30:11.640
Shammy dick, super thick

01:30:11.640 --> 01:30:15.640
Wash your windows, dry them quick

01:30:15.640 --> 01:30:17.640
You shammy don't fuck around

01:30:17.640 --> 01:30:18.640
Can't stop

01:30:18.640 --> 01:30:19.640
Shammy where?

01:30:19.640 --> 01:30:20.640
Shammy job

01:30:20.640 --> 01:30:21.640
My dad gave us

01:30:21.640 --> 01:30:28.640
Run up in this motherfucker, Jeff gave us a save us

01:30:28.640 --> 01:30:30.640
Yo, shammy dicks in the house

01:30:30.640 --> 01:30:33.640
Yo, his dick's like a towel

01:30:33.640 --> 01:30:34.640
Scrub me down so hard

01:30:34.640 --> 01:30:35.640
I make a pussy growl

01:30:35.640 --> 01:30:40.640
Make that pussy growl

01:30:40.640 --> 01:30:45.640
Yo, shammy dick, shammy dick

01:30:45.640 --> 01:30:50.640
Yo, his dick is soft, smooth, like a cough

01:30:50.640 --> 01:30:53.640
He'll invade your pussy like you were Roman

01:30:53.640 --> 01:30:58.640
His dick's a visigoth, he'll, what, yeah

01:30:58.640 --> 01:31:02.640
I'll take you back to 300 BC, motherfuckers

01:31:02.640 --> 01:31:06.640
300 BC is the year I invented

01:31:06.640 --> 01:31:09.640
Whip, whip, whip

01:31:09.640 --> 01:31:11.640
Oh, that's right

01:31:11.640 --> 01:31:14.640
Shammy dick

01:31:14.640 --> 01:31:19.640
Alright, good job, yeah

01:31:19.640 --> 01:31:24.640
We probably shouldn't have a phobia of finishing a show before 10pm

01:31:24.640 --> 01:31:27.640
We should probably, at those moments, we should be like, alright

01:31:27.640 --> 01:31:31.640
Sorry ladies, about that last, I don't know if it, it occurred to me

01:31:31.640 --> 01:31:37.640
If you'd never heard the show before, you'd be like, are they doing this to like, go to us?

01:31:37.640 --> 01:31:38.640
I was ready

01:31:38.640 --> 01:31:40.640
Yeah, we were here for you

01:31:40.640 --> 01:31:42.640
We didn't give Sarah and Beth a chance to freestyle

01:31:42.640 --> 01:31:44.640
You want to jump in on some of this shit?

01:31:44.640 --> 01:31:45.640
Yes!

01:31:45.640 --> 01:31:47.640
Mandatory

01:31:47.640 --> 01:31:49.640
You want mandatory?

01:31:49.640 --> 01:31:51.640
Beth is hungry for it

01:31:51.640 --> 01:31:54.640
Dustin, put a beat on before you get peed on

01:31:54.640 --> 01:32:00.640
Y'all heard of salt and pepper, this is turmeric and ginger

01:32:00.640 --> 01:32:05.640
Yeah

01:32:05.640 --> 01:32:10.640
I'm so spicy, I wish he'd clean me up with his dick

01:32:10.640 --> 01:32:15.640
Shammy dick, play it on thick, clean me up

01:32:15.640 --> 01:32:18.640
Shammy dick, ooh

01:32:18.640 --> 01:32:19.640
Shammy dick

01:32:19.640 --> 01:32:22.640
It's like I'm spicy, more like I'm very, very nicey

01:32:22.640 --> 01:32:25.640
Because I come in and shake your mom's hand

01:32:25.640 --> 01:32:27.640
But it's got semen all over it

01:32:27.640 --> 01:32:29.640
Because God knows what I've been doing

01:32:33.640 --> 01:32:37.640
Shammy dick

01:32:37.640 --> 01:32:39.640
Soft enough to wash a car

01:32:39.640 --> 01:32:43.640
Soft enough to be wherever you are, I want your body

01:32:43.640 --> 01:32:46.640
I want it for breakfast and lunch

01:32:46.640 --> 01:32:48.640
I want my lunch and lunch

01:32:48.640 --> 01:32:49.640
Sorry

01:32:49.640 --> 01:32:50.640
Sorry to interrupt

01:32:54.640 --> 01:32:56.640
You were shyin'

01:33:02.640 --> 01:33:05.640
Oh, it's Jeff Davis's turn

01:33:08.640 --> 01:33:11.640
Nobody wants to freestyle to this shit

01:33:11.640 --> 01:33:13.640
But I guess I'm gonna have to do it

01:33:13.640 --> 01:33:16.640
Because it is a great beat

01:33:16.640 --> 01:33:19.640
I have to say I wanna wash it like a car

01:33:19.640 --> 01:33:21.640
It's gonna cost me a lot of money

01:33:21.640 --> 01:33:24.640
Like a cami, a Toyota Camry

01:33:24.640 --> 01:33:27.640
A very good car, it doesn't take me very far

01:33:27.640 --> 01:33:29.640
But it's reliable

01:33:30.640 --> 01:33:33.640
Oh, Shammy dick

01:33:33.640 --> 01:33:36.640
Red dot trash, have a seat

01:33:39.640 --> 01:33:42.640
Yo, sometimes when I make love

01:33:42.640 --> 01:33:43.640
I need that Shammy

01:33:43.640 --> 01:33:45.640
I need someone to wipe down my dick

01:33:45.640 --> 01:33:47.640
After I drop my pearl jammy

01:33:48.640 --> 01:33:52.640
Yo, girl, can I get in your Camry?

01:33:53.640 --> 01:33:55.640
I'm reliable

01:33:56.640 --> 01:33:58.640
Also, my blue book rating's pretty high

01:33:58.640 --> 01:34:01.640
And my resale value is pretty, pretty good

01:34:01.640 --> 01:34:03.640
At least to own

01:34:05.640 --> 01:34:07.640
I'm a Tesla

01:34:07.640 --> 01:34:09.640
The sex robot of cars

01:34:09.640 --> 01:34:12.640
Wipe me down with your judgemental

01:34:13.640 --> 01:34:15.640
Shammy dick

01:34:17.640 --> 01:34:18.640
Shammy dick, yeah

01:34:18.640 --> 01:34:22.640
I'm gonna put a big lamb condom over your Tesla

01:34:22.640 --> 01:34:25.640
Cause that's the only way that I'll get you pregnant

01:34:28.640 --> 01:34:30.640
Cause they're bad condoms

01:34:30.640 --> 01:34:32.640
You shouldn't use those guys

01:34:34.640 --> 01:34:35.640
What should we use?

01:34:35.640 --> 01:34:37.640
I didn't, I didn't, it was a, oh

01:34:37.640 --> 01:34:40.640
It was a, oh that big, big thing over the Tesla

01:34:40.640 --> 01:34:42.640
A thing over the Tesla, complicated

01:34:42.640 --> 01:34:44.640
I don't have a car

01:34:44.640 --> 01:34:46.640
But when I get one of them

01:34:46.640 --> 01:34:48.640
I'm not gonna put a tarp on it

01:34:48.640 --> 01:34:50.640
Because it's like a shoe

01:34:50.640 --> 01:34:52.640
You're supposed to stomp or in it

01:34:52.640 --> 01:34:54.640
Supposed to collect mud and dirt

01:34:54.640 --> 01:34:56.640
Because if you're worth a car

01:34:56.640 --> 01:34:58.640
That's what a car is worth, I'm gonna

01:34:58.640 --> 01:35:02.640
Get a BMW, drive it in your booty

01:35:03.640 --> 01:35:05.640
I'm just gonna make you real moody

01:35:05.640 --> 01:35:08.640
If you're given to hysteria

01:35:08.640 --> 01:35:11.640
But I don't care, yeah

01:35:11.640 --> 01:35:14.640
Cause I'm a misogynist and I got a car

01:35:15.640 --> 01:35:18.640
I'm a misogynist car owner

01:35:18.640 --> 01:35:20.640
I got a boner

01:35:20.640 --> 01:35:22.640
And my car is my boner

01:35:22.640 --> 01:35:24.640
I'm an owner of a boner

01:35:26.640 --> 01:35:27.640
Yo, yo

01:35:27.640 --> 01:35:29.640
Hungry

01:35:32.640 --> 01:35:35.640
So heavy, heavier than my dick

01:35:36.640 --> 01:35:37.640
Yo

01:35:37.640 --> 01:35:40.640
My name is MC Miss Shape and Dick

01:35:40.640 --> 01:35:42.640
I had a mangled dick

01:35:42.640 --> 01:35:44.640
In an ice pick accident

01:35:44.640 --> 01:35:46.640
I got my dick mangled on

01:35:46.640 --> 01:35:50.640
I worked for ten years in a prison yard

01:35:50.640 --> 01:35:53.640
Trying to get my dick back into shape

01:35:53.640 --> 01:35:56.640
I go outside and I'm treated like a

01:35:56.640 --> 01:35:58.640
Great

01:35:58.640 --> 01:36:01.640
In that my wrath

01:36:01.640 --> 01:36:04.640
Is given aback

01:36:04.640 --> 01:36:06.640
Starting over with that thought

01:36:06.640 --> 01:36:10.640
Like I have a Miss Shape and Dick

01:36:10.640 --> 01:36:13.640
It hurts my feelings

01:36:13.640 --> 01:36:15.640
I'm afraid to show it to women

01:36:15.640 --> 01:36:18.640
So when I go swimming

01:36:18.640 --> 01:36:22.640
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm

01:36:22.640 --> 01:36:26.640
So worried, worried about it

01:36:27.640 --> 01:36:30.640
MC Miss Shape and Dick everybody

01:36:30.640 --> 01:36:32.640
MC Miss Shape and Dick

01:36:32.640 --> 01:36:35.640
MC Shammy Dick

01:36:36.640 --> 01:36:38.640
Alright

01:36:38.640 --> 01:36:39.640
DJ Camry

01:36:39.640 --> 01:36:41.640
How do we, how do we, how do we end our

01:36:41.640 --> 01:36:43.640
Shows before ten p.m. What do we do?

01:36:43.640 --> 01:36:46.640
I think we just slowly trail off into madness

01:36:48.640 --> 01:36:50.640
I wonder if it's not with a, is there

01:36:50.640 --> 01:36:54.640
Well, we, we, we, we have to be

01:36:54.640 --> 01:36:56.640
Improvised DnD and, we have to, oh wait,

01:36:56.640 --> 01:36:58.640
Let's do that! Okay, let's, let's figure out,

01:36:58.640 --> 01:37:00.640
Okay, we gotta, we gotta, we gotta

01:37:00.640 --> 01:37:02.640
Start doing role-playing, lets, let's make

01:37:02.640 --> 01:37:03.640
This official business, like we're, we're

01:37:03.640 --> 01:37:05.640
Gonna figure out, like, could we, should we

01:37:05.640 --> 01:37:08.640
Do, should we do a shadow run again

01:37:08.640 --> 01:37:09.640
Or should we find a new thing that's

01:37:09.640 --> 01:37:11.640
Technically not, a, whatever you guys

01:37:11.640 --> 01:37:13.640
Want, man. Whatever will keep you playing.

01:37:13.640 --> 01:37:15.640
Cuz Dan and I were talking about doing

01:37:15.640 --> 01:37:17.640
Like, our role-playing games got kind

01:37:17.640 --> 01:37:19.640
Of diffused because we would play it

01:37:19.640 --> 01:37:22.800
seven characters and sometimes none of them were here and we would never

01:37:22.800 --> 01:37:26.400
remember what the hell was going on so we're talking about going back to kind

01:37:26.400 --> 01:37:32.560
of the old days of like Sharpie and Quark and Spencer where it's maybe not

01:37:32.560 --> 01:37:36.560
end the show like do like a mid-show segment where the three of us play a

01:37:36.560 --> 01:37:41.080
little RPG. We're so drunk that we have no idea what's going on. Exactly but we

01:37:41.080 --> 01:37:45.480
have a little legal maybe trouble with because of Harmon Quest. The way to be

01:37:45.480 --> 01:37:51.080
the safest of anything if it's just if it's not. Oh that's an excellent point

01:37:51.080 --> 01:37:59.200
actually. What? Electric Boogaloo? Yeah yeah. One of the break dancers from Beat

01:37:59.200 --> 01:38:06.480
Street? Oh yeah he's being sarcastic. It's yeah weird weird to yell that out but

01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:10.520
also don't want to say weird because weird could have positive connotations

01:38:10.520 --> 01:38:21.880
like dumb dumb to yell that out. It's gonna be a dick about it. I mean that

01:38:21.880 --> 01:38:33.360
cadence says only one thing. Boxed wine. Yeah. Somebody please take her box of

01:38:33.360 --> 01:38:40.480
wine away from her. I am here to vote. Say dumb to yell that out but

01:38:40.480 --> 01:38:47.120
weird to defend it which is which is a positive thing. I defend her defending it.

01:38:47.120 --> 01:38:50.720
I think the person that yelled it out was dumb. Electric Boogaloo? She's kind of

01:38:50.720 --> 01:38:56.880
Joan of Arc for going like fuck it he deserves to live. I'm like yeah she's

01:38:56.880 --> 01:39:00.960
right. I don't think they just sit next to each other. I hope Electric Boogaloo in

01:39:00.960 --> 01:39:06.560
one box lady get the fucking get it on the night. But I hope that she keeps

01:39:06.560 --> 01:39:13.800
talking to him that way. You don't have to be. You can take me home with you. We

01:39:13.800 --> 01:39:19.400
should get each other's number. And he comes home every night from a day of

01:39:19.400 --> 01:39:24.000
frustration he's like I just keep yelling out Electric Boogaloo and no one

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:29.840
gets me. And she's like you don't have to be. He deserves to yell it out. And he's

01:39:29.840 --> 01:39:37.680
like I love you. And she's like let's get something beyond bath salts. I don't

01:39:37.680 --> 01:39:44.160
want to just eat the face. I want to eat the soul. Let's bring Florida to

01:39:44.160 --> 01:39:52.200
Los Angeles. That's why we moved here. You're the one that said shimmy dick.

01:39:52.200 --> 01:39:59.600
Don't even try it. My heart is dead.

01:40:01.360 --> 01:40:06.360
Motherfucker pays my rent. I've known this motherfucker for 15 years. You think I'm

01:40:06.360 --> 01:40:09.280
gonna pick you, braveheart?

01:40:12.920 --> 01:40:18.600
They tried to pick on the black. You're our favorite. No dog. I know what a

01:40:18.600 --> 01:40:22.320
slave ship conductor looks like.

01:40:27.040 --> 01:40:31.680
You're our favorite. Get on board.

01:40:32.120 --> 01:40:42.640
Love. Exciting. Motherfucker got gutsy but it black fired. I'm like the Brad Pitt

01:40:42.640 --> 01:40:46.760
right like in that metaphor like I like I come with my beard and I'm like

01:40:46.760 --> 01:40:50.560
helping you build shit and I'm like I don't get it. Tell me explain slavery to

01:40:50.560 --> 01:40:55.560
me. I don't get it. I don't get it. We're gonna get you out of here. You would

01:40:55.560 --> 01:41:02.320
certainly be the slave owner. It's not true. Although I do feel like my mom. I

01:41:02.320 --> 01:41:10.520
remember my mom. You have two assistants. When we were well just because I take to

01:41:10.520 --> 01:41:18.440
ownership well doesn't mean that I'm like that's that's different. But I do

01:41:18.440 --> 01:41:21.200
feel like there was a constant thing when I was growing up in Milwaukee where

01:41:21.200 --> 01:41:25.920
there was there were people that would call our house like cold calling to

01:41:25.920 --> 01:41:29.840
round up family reunions and there would always be this awkward moment where the

01:41:29.840 --> 01:41:33.840
person calling would be like yes the Harmon family is getting together in the

01:41:33.840 --> 01:41:38.400
park and my mom would be like okay well where should we go? And he'd be like well

01:41:38.400 --> 01:41:43.240
we're meeting by the water fountain. Forgive me for asking but are you white?

01:41:43.240 --> 01:41:49.880
And my mom would go yes we are. And he'd go well we're we aren't. And then my mom

01:41:49.880 --> 01:41:55.680
would get off the phone and go I think someone in our family owned slaves. Not

01:41:55.680 --> 01:42:02.760
we should go to that nice black family's party. They did that convert that phone

01:42:02.760 --> 01:42:06.840
called disinvited us. The guy was like very he would be like you're not

01:42:06.840 --> 01:42:14.040
invited. That is not fucking true. No you black people you you're exclusionary.

01:42:14.040 --> 01:42:23.080
My fucking last name is Johnson. We party with everybody. Good God. The black

01:42:23.080 --> 01:42:27.720
Swedes. If somebody fucking says Johnson I shows up for the free food I'm not

01:42:27.720 --> 01:42:32.160
stupid. You should have fucking shown up. These motherfuckers would be like we're

01:42:32.160 --> 01:42:34.920
the richest hormones and we have the greatest restaurants but that white

01:42:34.920 --> 01:42:40.840
family won't show up to our barbecue. Well we should have gone. I didn't have a

01:42:40.840 --> 01:42:47.880
say in that family. I would have gone. I should have. I should have. You said you

01:42:47.880 --> 01:42:51.160
made monologues that made change. You could have stood up. I should have made

01:42:51.160 --> 01:42:56.040
one of my monologues. Let's go party with black people. I didn't do it. Well

01:42:56.040 --> 01:43:09.960
it's not too late. Bring out Reginald Harmon. He's like Dan I'm the one who

01:43:09.960 --> 01:43:19.960
supplied your rap beat. You show me no familial love Dan. Yeah. Am I still your

01:43:19.960 --> 01:43:26.520
favorite. Nope. I know more because I got your ass. You don't let me know more do

01:43:26.520 --> 01:43:40.840
you. Okay. It's as a timing. It's hard. It's like a thing that you learn. It's

01:43:40.840 --> 01:43:45.600
like it's like it's like with ice skating. It's like oh you have blades in

01:43:45.600 --> 01:43:48.200
your feet and it's slippery out there. I've done both of these things and you

01:43:48.200 --> 01:43:54.640
just go out and it's just like and it happens to us too primarily when

01:43:54.640 --> 01:44:03.400
people are just like are the only people that get through are the people

01:44:03.400 --> 01:44:11.600
sort of so blind drunk that they're just like and we welcome them all and we

01:44:11.600 --> 01:44:15.360
want them all to come up on stage and stuff but then there's this Jerry

01:44:15.360 --> 01:44:18.640
Springer effect and then I need I need to be a better ringmaster I need to like

01:44:18.640 --> 01:44:35.720
crack the crack the whip like a ringmaster ringmaster Jeff was right

01:44:35.720 --> 01:44:48.880
Jeff was right. He thinks he's the Brad Pitt in that movie. I'm one mustache away man. I'd be like thank you kindly oh hey there's two by four don't you think you

01:44:48.880 --> 01:44:54.760
should just be hanging out I don't get it. Sure thing ringmaster. You know what I'm

01:44:54.760 --> 01:44:59.000
gonna talk to a guy who's gonna talk to a guy I think I can get you signed with an

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:04.800
agency that get you out of this out of this southern area. I'm from Sweden I

01:45:04.800 --> 01:45:09.300
don't know what's going on. I just produced the movie it was just like this

01:45:09.300 --> 01:45:14.940
magical white man. Why am I why am I throwing Brad Pitt into the bus he

01:45:14.940 --> 01:45:26.640
tried to do trying to do a good thing. I didn't hear it but I didn't I didn't

01:45:26.640 --> 01:45:37.380
hear it. You don't have to be a dick about it. Alright well so what kind of

01:45:37.380 --> 01:45:41.760
weird muppet show is happening in the back row right now. It could be like it

01:45:41.760 --> 01:45:49.320
could be the French. I don't even understand the inside jokes of the

01:45:49.320 --> 01:45:56.800
people that are mocking. He was doing a Boxed Wine. That's Boxed Wine, Franzi.

01:45:56.800 --> 01:46:02.320
Our show brought to you by Franzi. That's where we loosen the

01:46:02.320 --> 01:46:07.200
reins enough for the Hoy Ploy to ooze in and teach us that there's a reason why

01:46:07.200 --> 01:46:13.880
some of us are elitist. Now we bring it back around. So lucky that

01:46:13.880 --> 01:46:17.960
you guys do your show in the confines of a studio where you guys you don't have

01:46:17.960 --> 01:46:26.160
to deal with everything. Oh yeah we hate people. Have you guys ever done when you

01:46:26.160 --> 01:46:30.440
do when you do your live show do you ever how loose are the how loose is the

01:46:30.440 --> 01:46:35.840
grip on people like chiming in and do you guys like you know what are your

01:46:35.840 --> 01:46:40.160
feelings there what's your philosophy. People haven't chimed in at all actually

01:46:40.160 --> 01:46:45.560
I don't know I mean like our hosts are nuts so they kind of just like occupy

01:46:45.560 --> 01:46:50.000
the space and there really isn't a lot of room for people to get in there. We create

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:56.840
our own crazy. Yeah yeah it's our own particular brand. We just verified from

01:46:56.840 --> 01:47:02.880
one of our producers Kevin the woman that I jokingly said I did not know this I

01:47:02.880 --> 01:47:07.720
said she was drinking Boxed Wine apparently not only is that true she's

01:47:07.720 --> 01:47:15.160
taking the bag out of the box and just drinking it out of the mylar bag like a fucking

01:47:15.160 --> 01:47:24.000
she's doing it right. Like Daniel Boone like a bag. She's playing Danny Boy. I didn't know I was

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:27.200
right about Boxed Wine. I thought I was just I thought I was just being an asshole and

01:47:27.200 --> 01:47:32.640
turns out I was morally safer. All right how do we how do we end the show how

01:47:32.640 --> 01:47:36.840
do we end a show how does anyone ever end a show I've never learned. How about one

01:47:36.840 --> 01:47:41.760
of your Andy Rooney moments where you just break it down. Kind of give me a

01:47:41.760 --> 01:47:49.760
thing that I should decry. Boxed wine. Why is why is wine always coming in boxes. No

01:47:49.760 --> 01:48:00.640
one knows who Andy Rooney is. Thank you thank you thank you son thank you. Do

01:48:00.640 --> 01:48:07.040
your Rachel Maddow. Give us a Rachel Maddow Keith Oberman fucking like break down like

01:48:07.040 --> 01:48:10.800
how do we feel about Keith Oberman does anybody because I feel like he's not as

01:48:10.800 --> 01:48:13.840
popular as he should be like I love that he's like sitting in a basement just

01:48:13.840 --> 01:48:18.040
like fucking calling out just going like holy shit. Does he does he does he hit

01:48:18.040 --> 01:48:20.960
his wife or something like what why is it that everyone's not like Keith

01:48:20.960 --> 01:48:27.120
Oberman is my jam. I'm never gonna forgive you for sports. I was that what

01:48:27.120 --> 01:48:31.440
really he went he was a sportscaster for a little while. Yes so what like nerds

01:48:31.440 --> 01:48:35.680
don't appreciate that shit but he defected he defected that's why I that's

01:48:35.680 --> 01:48:40.800
part of why I that's not cool because I because I looked at his Wikipedia I was

01:48:40.800 --> 01:48:44.720
expecting to see like oh he you know I don't know something that was like dirt

01:48:44.720 --> 01:48:48.600
that dirtied him just enough that he's like just sitting alone going like didn't

01:48:48.600 --> 01:48:52.360
he get fired from MSNBC. Yeah he got fired for some thing I forget what it was. But the

01:48:52.360 --> 01:48:56.320
reason he got fired or he got suspended because he donated while he was working

01:48:56.320 --> 01:49:00.840
on his thing he donated two thousand four hundred dollars to each of three

01:49:00.840 --> 01:49:06.080
Democratic parties and then it was a technical infraction so he took a

01:49:06.080 --> 01:49:09.920
suspension and then after the suspension they just didn't

01:49:09.920 --> 01:49:13.400
negotiate his contract and nobody really knows this is all of Wikipedia that I

01:49:13.400 --> 01:49:16.640
went there to going like I fully expected to hear that he like hit a kid

01:49:16.640 --> 01:49:22.520
with his car okay so he's his major failure is that he's not an intelligent

01:49:22.520 --> 01:49:28.520
lesbian I think that's really what he's lacking. What do you mean by that?

01:49:28.520 --> 01:49:34.520
He's lost a Rachel Maddow. There can only be one. Right.

01:49:34.520 --> 01:49:38.520
And Rachel Maddow is doing it. Her brand is strong.

01:49:38.520 --> 01:49:43.920
She just does like awesome stand-up like her whole show she looks at the

01:49:43.920 --> 01:49:48.840
camera and just does like like extended stand-up bits. I adore her I have room

01:49:48.840 --> 01:49:53.280
in my life for both of them I'm not bragging when I say that I just didn't

01:49:53.280 --> 01:49:57.080
see them as yeah well I have to watch one or the other like I and he looks like

01:49:57.080 --> 01:50:01.680
Sam the Eagle so as I would think that I would think that he would have like a

01:50:01.680 --> 01:50:06.200
hardcore demographic that would be like I'm I'm ashamed enough of my straight

01:50:06.200 --> 01:50:11.720
white male like alpha whatever alpha beta-ness that that I want to I want to

01:50:11.720 --> 01:50:14.760
be ashamed of it but at the same time he's just like this like he cuts that

01:50:14.760 --> 01:50:17.480
silhouette so it's like you're you have permission to like him because he's going

01:50:17.480 --> 01:50:22.440
like I don't know he's like I love Keith Oberman which is like he's like he's

01:50:22.440 --> 01:50:25.920
like sitting in a basement somewhere like doing webisodes for GQ and he's like

01:50:25.920 --> 01:50:29.120
the he's like again he just like does these webisodes and he's just like

01:50:29.120 --> 01:50:35.120
fucking like just like this hyper verbose like hyperbolic like he's like the

01:50:35.120 --> 01:50:39.200
sky is falling and he ends every podcast by going resist and he holds up like a

01:50:39.200 --> 01:50:44.800
Spock sign and it's like peace and he's like and his Twitter avatar is him

01:50:44.800 --> 01:50:49.160
wrapped in a flag like Daniel D Lewis and Gangs of New York and like it's like

01:50:49.160 --> 01:50:52.880
he's like he's like lost his mind but in a good way because in a mad world only

01:50:52.880 --> 01:50:56.360
the mad are sane like I just I just fucking want to marry him do you like

01:50:56.360 --> 01:51:02.280
him he's he should do he should do a show with Sam the Eagle you know why

01:51:02.280 --> 01:51:06.160
don't you like Keith Oberman I think he comes off as kind of a blowhard maybe

01:51:06.160 --> 01:51:14.760
that's my guess I only trust him and you so when I got I got in the car and I

01:51:14.760 --> 01:51:18.080
said what do you think of Keith Oberman you're like he's fine and I was like I'm

01:51:18.080 --> 01:51:20.800
not gonna ask anything else because I didn't want my heart broken oh he's fine

01:51:20.800 --> 01:51:24.880
because if you told me he was but I would be like now what do I do I want to

01:51:24.880 --> 01:51:29.240
do can we talk about heartbreak I went and had Thai food across the street at

01:51:29.240 --> 01:51:34.200

me physically upset that's just that's beyond lazy into like I thought that

01:52:21.560 --> 01:52:24.800
maybe they changed it from fortunes into advice cookies because they're trying

01:52:24.800 --> 01:52:29.920
to avoid litigation so they would just be like they used to say like duck or like

01:52:29.920 --> 01:52:34.120
like you're gonna meet somebody today guaranteed and like maybe they like
