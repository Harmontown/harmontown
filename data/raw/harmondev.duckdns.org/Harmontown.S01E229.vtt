{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:18.440\nFrom Hollywood, California, Meltdown Comics, The Nerdist Theater, Carmen Town is now at\n\n00:18.440 --> 00:45.200\nthe end of the season.\n\n00:45.200 --> 01:10.320\nThank you for coming to the show I'm doing.\n\n01:10.320 --> 01:18.960\nAll right, so yeah, my therapist, she recommended a book for me and then she didn't tell me,\n\n01:18.960 --> 01:22.480\nshe just told me the title and then I got it and then the guy started talking and it's\n\n01:22.480 --> 01:23.480\nan ADD book.\n\n01:23.480 --> 01:27.680\nI think I might be in the verge of a diagnosis.\n\n01:27.680 --> 01:30.320\nBut she didn't want to, you could tell because I was like, you want to recommend any other\n\n01:30.320 --> 01:31.320\nbooks?\n\n01:31.320 --> 01:32.920\nAnd she's like, just let me know how this one goes.\n\n01:32.920 --> 01:38.640\nBut I think like she's very begrudging like, because you know, I'm a self-diagnoser, right?\n\n01:38.640 --> 01:41.320\nI think she like wanted to put the kibosh on that right away.\n\n01:41.320 --> 01:43.160\nShe's like, you're not fucking autistic.\n\n01:43.160 --> 01:44.160\nYou poser.\n\n01:44.160 --> 01:51.080\nAnd I am and I'm from like, like it's hard to pay attention to this book about ADD.\n\n01:51.080 --> 01:57.040\nIt's hard to, it literally honestly looks like it's not even a joke because the guy\n\n01:57.040 --> 02:01.360\nthat wrote it as ADD and he's a doctor that diagnoses it, which makes you think like, wait,\n\n02:01.360 --> 02:02.920\nis this like the stuff with Garrett Morris?\n\n02:02.920 --> 02:04.840\nIs it just a thing that like spreads?\n\n02:04.840 --> 02:12.400\nHe's looking up the blob like, like, like, but, but the, the, but just I got to calm\n\n02:12.400 --> 02:13.400\ndown because here's the thing.\n\n02:13.400 --> 02:14.400\nOkay.\n\n02:14.400 --> 02:18.600\nThe beginning of the book, it even went, so, hey, how's it going?\n\n02:18.600 --> 02:25.560\nHey guys, the beginning of the book went so far as to say ADD people have a hard time\n\n02:25.560 --> 02:29.920\nfinishing books and this book was made with that in mind.\n\n02:29.920 --> 02:35.840\nBut with that in mind, they did not go that extra mile to make it accessible to ADD people.\n\n02:35.840 --> 02:38.040\nI don't think it was very slow paced.\n\n02:38.040 --> 02:42.840\nWell, there's like a great way to get away with writing a shitty book.\n\n02:42.840 --> 02:47.440\nThere's two, there's two versions of the book that when I look on audio books, it's called\n\n02:47.440 --> 02:54.120\ndriven to distraction or not driven to distraction delivered from distraction.\n\n02:54.120 --> 02:57.400\nThe former is like a Harlequin romance novel.\n\n02:57.400 --> 03:04.000\nIf you get the name of your ADD book wrong, you might have ADD.\n\n03:04.000 --> 03:07.040\nBut there's a, there's two versions and there were the slightly different colored cover\n\n03:07.040 --> 03:10.200\nand one is three hours and one is 12 hours.\n\n03:10.200 --> 03:14.880\nAnd then I, I could only get the three hour one in because I wasn't on Wi-Fi.\n\n03:14.880 --> 03:20.640\nAnd then he begins, he says like, this is the three hour version because you have ADD.\n\n03:20.640 --> 03:23.880\nBut then also in addition to that, very boring, very boring book.\n\n03:23.880 --> 03:24.880\nYeah.\n\n03:24.880 --> 03:27.760\nAnd you're an Adderall user, enthusiast.\n\n03:27.760 --> 03:35.200\nAnd I thought, illegitimately, but imagine my surprise to find out I'm on medication.\n\n03:35.200 --> 03:41.840\nBut the people I know that actually have that are diagnosed with ADD or ADHD that, and they\n\n03:41.840 --> 03:48.000\ntake Adderall, they don't get like a beat that actually just restores their memory.\n\n03:48.000 --> 03:52.320\nHaving listened to 15 minutes of this 12 hour audio book, I can tell you there's a lot of\n\n03:52.320 --> 03:53.320\nmisconceptions.\n\n03:53.320 --> 03:56.000\nFirst of all, it's a, it's everybody's different.\n\n03:56.000 --> 03:57.000\nThat's what you'll hear about.\n\n03:57.000 --> 03:58.000\nEverything.\n\n03:58.000 --> 04:02.400\nIt's like, it should be called attention fluctuation disorder if it was going to be like named\n\n04:02.400 --> 04:05.400\nin a way that would help you like this.\n\n04:05.400 --> 04:08.400\nPeople have hyper focus that have ADD.\n\n04:08.400 --> 04:13.400\nPeople have, are easily distracted like, like, like, like, you know, they're just scattered.\n\n04:13.400 --> 04:17.360\nThey're just, you just, it's like, it's kind of, you know, it's, it's all over the place.\n\n04:17.360 --> 04:21.840\nYou have hyper empathy, you have, you're, it, there's just a lot of overlap with things\n\n04:21.840 --> 04:25.880\nthat you could see, like you could diagnose somebody being bipolar, like a lot of their,\n\n04:25.880 --> 04:31.520\na lot of the things like you can both bipolar people and ADD people, they, you, you, they\n\n04:31.520 --> 04:36.320\ncould behave feel identically in certain situations.\n\n04:36.320 --> 04:40.280\nLike at certain times you'd be like, oh, that person's bipolar or vice, or ADD and you could\n\n04:40.280 --> 04:45.160\nbe, it could be the other thing because like both of those categories, you could, in spite\n\n04:45.160 --> 04:52.360\nof all outward empirical evidence that you've, you're doing fine, you could feel like you're\n\n04:52.360 --> 04:56.000\na piece of shit and you need to just eat a bucket of shit and jump off a roof.\n\n04:56.000 --> 04:58.320\nLike ADD people can feel that way.\n\n04:58.320 --> 05:01.000\nAnd then the other thing that I thought was really valuable to know, which I should have\n\n05:01.000 --> 05:04.040\njust Googled in the first place, because you just, you always sit around and ask this stuff\n\n05:04.040 --> 05:07.280\nand you never look it up, ADHD versus ADD.\n\n05:07.280 --> 05:13.040\nIt's not, it's not like ADD and then you add an H, they changed the name.\n\n05:13.040 --> 05:15.020\nThey changed the name to ADHD.\n\n05:15.020 --> 05:19.720\nYou can have a form of ADHD in which you're not hyperactive.\n\n05:19.720 --> 05:24.120\nIt's called ADHD minus the H. They don't call it ADD.\n\n05:24.120 --> 05:25.320\nThey changed the name.\n\n05:25.320 --> 05:26.320\nThere's some clinicians that continue to do it.\n\n05:26.320 --> 05:29.000\nThe new DSM changed it a lot.\n\n05:29.000 --> 05:33.240\nThat's why autism is, or no, that's why Asperger's is now just part of autism.\n\n05:33.240 --> 05:34.240\nIt's like the same.\n\n05:34.240 --> 05:35.240\nYeah.\n\n05:35.240 --> 05:36.240\nIt's exciting stuff.\n\n05:36.240 --> 05:38.760\nIt's super exciting, super exciting stuff.\n\n05:38.760 --> 05:41.880\nWhat do you think your, your hyper thing is?\n\n05:41.880 --> 05:43.520\nWhat do you hyper about?\n\n05:43.520 --> 05:44.520\nOh, I don't know.\n\n05:44.520 --> 05:49.760\nWell, I was, look, I don't, I don't got nothing until somebody tells me I do.\n\n05:49.760 --> 05:52.160\nBut, but you, but you want it though.\n\n05:52.160 --> 05:53.360\nYou're excited about a diagnosis.\n\n05:53.360 --> 05:59.480\nNo, I want, I want cheap Adderall and I got that because I told the pharmacist from Yelp\n\n05:59.480 --> 06:01.760\nthat I had trouble watching movies or something.\n\n06:01.760 --> 06:03.280\nI don't remember what he asked.\n\n06:03.280 --> 06:06.640\nHe asked three questions and said, you definitely have ADD, which I know you're never supposed\n\n06:06.640 --> 06:09.280\nto say you definitely have anything as a doctor.\n\n06:09.280 --> 06:15.800\nSo, but he, I found him on Yelp, but I, what, what, what I have, okay, here's some things\n\n06:15.800 --> 06:20.880\nthat I have that I'm, I'd be relieved to learn were symptomatic.\n\n06:20.880 --> 06:24.800\nI have a very, very, and, and, and not because they would excuse the behavior because they\n\n06:24.800 --> 06:28.080\nwould help me, they would empower me to go like, I got to work on that.\n\n06:28.080 --> 06:32.200\nYou know, it's a, I just have a really hard time being interrupted.\n\n06:32.200 --> 06:35.640\nYou may notice that sometimes I snap at you a little bit if I'm in the middle of like a\n\n06:35.640 --> 06:36.640\npoint or something.\n\n06:36.640 --> 06:37.640\nIt reminds me of the story.\n\n06:37.640 --> 06:41.200\nLike, fuck, I'm trying to talk.\n\n06:41.200 --> 06:42.200\nEasy, easy joke.\n\n06:42.200 --> 06:46.240\nWe rehearsed that backstage.\n\n06:46.240 --> 06:52.080\nBut if I could be in the middle of a tweet, like a fucking dumb observation that Trump\n\n06:52.080 --> 06:56.560\nis a dick or something like, and, and, and my girlfriend could come over and I'm like,\n\n06:56.560 --> 06:57.560\nI'm tweeting.\n\n06:57.560 --> 07:00.600\nI'm in the middle of a tweet and I'm like trying to reword like, or I could be in the\n\n07:00.600 --> 07:05.160\nmiddle of a thought or let alone like, then you bring like addictive things like Minecraft\n\n07:05.160 --> 07:08.040\nor something into that, like, or if I'm in the middle of a train of thought, even though\n\n07:08.040 --> 07:11.320\nI just ramble, I don't have, I don't have a right to be upset when people interrupt\n\n07:11.320 --> 07:12.320\nme.\n\n07:12.320 --> 07:14.320\nI would never stop talking if nobody interrupted me.\n\n07:14.320 --> 07:19.040\nBut interruption is like, I have a harder, I get distracted and I'll either go like,\n\n07:19.040 --> 07:23.680\nwait, what, what, what, like, you know, like, like, like, or, or I'll, I'll like pretend\n\n07:23.680 --> 07:24.680\nI'm listening.\n\n07:24.680 --> 07:28.440\nI'm like, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, and I'll be burping while I'm talking and, and the\n\n07:28.440 --> 07:32.480\nperson will think I'm listening to them and I'm not, you know, it's a kind of like a hyper\n\n07:32.480 --> 07:37.120\nfocus is what that is, I think, and like, so knowing that you have that, you go like,\n\n07:37.120 --> 07:40.520\nokay, I'm going to work on that, you know, and there's like things I'm excited to learn\n\n07:40.520 --> 07:44.000\nabout called like a interactive metronome or something like that.\n\n07:44.000 --> 07:45.000\nI don't know.\n\n07:45.000 --> 07:48.720\nIt sounds like some kind of sounds fun.\n\n07:48.720 --> 07:49.720\nThere's like treatments.\n\n07:49.720 --> 07:54.000\nYou can treat yourself, you know, I think everybody should, if when we go to the moon,\n\n07:54.000 --> 07:55.000\nwe should all treat ourselves.\n\n07:55.000 --> 07:56.000\nHere's what we're going to do.\n\n07:56.000 --> 07:58.120\nWe're going to treat ourselves in both sense of the words.\n\n07:58.120 --> 08:02.440\nWe're going to all, everyone, everyone's personality is going to be a disease.\n\n08:02.440 --> 08:05.720\nYou, you, you, what's your name, sir?\n\n08:05.720 --> 08:06.720\nTom.\n\n08:06.720 --> 08:07.720\nTom, you have Tomism.\n\n08:07.720 --> 08:14.400\nYou, you are, you have, you have hyper Tom disorder or, or, or, or, or inappropriate\n\n08:14.400 --> 08:19.240\nTom, Tom disorder, like, you, you, you, you are Tom, but that doesn't mean you get to\n\n08:19.240 --> 08:24.320\njust run around barfing on people and going, oh, but Tom, that's how Tom rolls.\n\n08:24.320 --> 08:27.720\nIt's an invitation for other people to accept who you are.\n\n08:27.720 --> 08:28.720\nOh, that's Tom.\n\n08:28.720 --> 08:34.000\nHe has Tomism, and then also the other side is you got to be, they're going to do that\n\n08:34.000 --> 08:37.400\nbecause they think that when you go home, you're like, you, you owe it to them to be\n\n08:37.400 --> 08:42.600\nlike, fucking, fucking Tomism, I got to work on this shit until I'm, until I'm like, I\n\n08:42.600 --> 08:43.600\ndon't know.\n\n08:43.600 --> 08:45.600\nWhat do you think of the noticeable symptoms of Tomism?\n\n08:45.600 --> 08:57.360\nUh, do they polite smirk, you know, uh, we, we, we, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,\n\n08:57.360 --> 09:05.200\nfuturistic members only, uh, windbreaker and, uh, general handsomeness and, uh, uh, latent\n\n09:05.200 --> 09:09.200\nhoodie, latent, latent hoodie, uh, tendencies.\n\n09:09.200 --> 09:10.200\nYeah.\n\n09:10.200 --> 09:15.360\nNot, not sure if there's a hood or not, uh, could, could just be, uh, doing equipment\n\n09:15.360 --> 09:16.360\nback there.\n\n09:16.360 --> 09:17.360\nYeah.\n\n09:17.360 --> 09:18.360\nOkay.\n\n09:18.360 --> 09:19.360\nWhat am I?\n\n09:19.360 --> 09:20.360\nWhat am I?\n\n09:20.360 --> 09:21.360\nAn insult comic?\n\n09:21.360 --> 09:22.360\nI'm going to make fun of you.\n\n09:22.360 --> 09:25.360\nYou called, you called his name a disease.\n\n09:25.360 --> 09:26.360\nYou know what I was doing.\n\n09:26.360 --> 09:27.360\nI know.\n\n09:27.360 --> 09:32.360\nIt was, it was, what I was doing was beautiful.\n\n09:32.360 --> 09:33.360\nIt's a beautiful idea.\n\n09:33.360 --> 09:36.040\nEveryone's, you know, and this is another thing.\n\n09:36.040 --> 09:40.520\nNow I know whenever I share beautiful things with you guys and I sense that you guys don't\n\n09:40.520 --> 09:43.520\nappreciate me enough, it's just the disease.\n\n09:43.520 --> 09:46.440\nIt's you guys aren't assholes.\n\n09:46.440 --> 09:49.880\nI used to think, I used to think I was a piece of shit and that you guys are making me feel\n\n09:49.880 --> 09:50.880\nthat way.\n\n09:50.880 --> 09:55.520\nAnd then like, like I would go home and I'd go, that audience, I love them, but we got\n\n09:55.520 --> 09:58.120\nto, we got to figure this shit out.\n\n09:58.120 --> 09:59.880\nBut now I know it's just all in my head.\n\n09:59.880 --> 10:01.520\nLike you're just a bunch of people sitting around.\n\n10:01.520 --> 10:02.520\nWho knows what you're thinking.\n\n10:02.520 --> 10:04.520\nThey're all just, they all have diseases.\n\n10:04.520 --> 10:05.520\nYeah.\n\n10:05.520 --> 10:06.520\nYeah.\n\n10:06.520 --> 10:11.280\nYou're, you're Mary, Mary, Mary, Maryitis and Ralphists.\n\n10:11.280 --> 10:17.400\nLet's,

11:30.440\nYeah.\n\n11:30.440 --> 11:40.400\nReductress is a parody satirical web news site with a feminist point of view, but it\n\n11:40.400 --> 11:44.160\ncould be satirizing both the feminist point of view and the world around us.\n\n11:44.160 --> 11:45.160\nIt's, you know?\n\n11:45.160 --> 11:46.160\nYeah.\n\n11:46.160 --> 11:48.720\nI would say that's like, that's an A minus.\n\n11:48.720 --> 11:49.720\nThat's good.\n\n11:49.720 --> 11:50.720\nThat's good.\n\n11:50.720 --> 11:51.720\nYeah.\n\n11:51.720 --> 11:54.400\nIn a world where there's such a thing as web news and we're all getting our news from\n\n11:54.400 --> 11:57.240\nthe web, and I don't know why Clickhole is not more popular, like it's one of the old\n\n11:57.240 --> 12:03.320\nfew, like, like, like attempts in a post newspaper world where we all recognize that the onion\n\n12:03.320 --> 12:05.680\nwas doing something important.\n\n12:05.680 --> 12:11.600\nAnd then the web became like this horrible cesspool and comedy seemed to just, like,\n\n12:11.600 --> 12:16.000\nthat onion instinct seemed to just go like, like, like, or maybe there's not enough demand\n\n12:16.000 --> 12:22.400\nfor it, like the Clickhole should be, it should be more powerful, people should be constantly\n\n12:22.400 --> 12:26.240\nlike, oh, I'm so happy that someone's pointing out how Clickhole is pointing out how we're\n\n12:26.240 --> 12:27.240\nall fucked.\n\n12:27.240 --> 12:28.240\nYeah.\n\n12:28.240 --> 12:32.720\nI don't think, I don't think most of the world knows how fucked up the internet is yet.\n\n12:32.720 --> 12:35.720\nSo they don't even understand what Clickhole is doing.\n\n12:35.720 --> 12:37.520\nIt's really hard to satirize garbage.\n\n12:37.520 --> 12:38.520\nYeah.\n\n12:38.520 --> 12:39.520\nYeah.\n\n12:39.520 --> 12:40.520\nIt parenties itself.\n\n12:40.520 --> 12:43.280\nAre you guys, you guys seem like you're probably a little younger than me.\n\n12:43.280 --> 12:50.520\nI don't see any, I'm not going to objectify you, but you, you seem smooth and, uh...\n\n12:50.520 --> 12:51.520\nThank you.\n\n12:51.520 --> 12:56.440\nDan, Dan, they are certainly younger than you.\n\n12:56.440 --> 12:57.440\nDo you have opinions?\n\n12:57.440 --> 12:59.440\nDo you think that it's, it's hot?\n\n12:59.440 --> 13:00.440\nNo.\n\n13:00.440 --> 13:01.440\nAs a woman?\n\n13:01.440 --> 13:02.440\nNo.\n\n13:02.440 --> 13:05.440\nNo, absolutely not.\n\n13:05.440 --> 13:07.880\nDo young women still have opinions?\n\n13:07.880 --> 13:14.040\nDo you have opinions about generational stuff versus like, uh, relationship with irony?\n\n13:14.040 --> 13:19.200\nDo you think, like, I'm 44, I've sat up here a lot and said, like, I don't think the kids\n\n13:19.200 --> 13:21.440\nare, I don't think they get irony as much.\n\n13:21.440 --> 13:22.440\nOh, really?\n\n13:22.440 --> 13:26.080\nBecause when we talk to our parents, we're like, we don't think they get what we're doing.\n\n13:26.080 --> 13:27.080\nYeah.\n\n13:27.080 --> 13:28.080\nYeah.\n\n13:28.080 --> 13:29.080\nNo, they don't see irony at all.\n\n13:29.080 --> 13:31.400\nBut everyone thought that irony was dead when Obama got elected.\n\n13:31.400 --> 13:33.080\nI don't think it went anywhere.\n\n13:33.080 --> 13:35.080\nWe still have it.\n\n13:35.080 --> 13:36.080\nRight.\n\n13:36.080 --> 13:38.520\nSo, is it, is it, I mean, do you guys tweet and stuff?\n\n13:38.520 --> 13:39.520\nDo you ever tweet bits?\n\n13:39.520 --> 13:40.520\nYeah.\n\n13:40.520 --> 13:41.520\nYeah.\n\n13:41.520 --> 13:44.360\nDo you, do you find, like, like, then people tweet back, like, if you tweeted, like, I'm\n\n13:44.360 --> 13:46.080\ntrying to think of a, just a simple example.\n\n13:46.080 --> 13:50.200\nOh, like, you make a joke that's a question and someone answers the question as they want\n\n13:50.200 --> 13:51.200\nit.\n\n13:51.200 --> 13:53.080\nOr you make a joke that's like pointing out, you're like, boy, I can't believe Tom Cruise\n\n13:53.080 --> 13:54.080\ndidn't do this.\n\n13:54.080 --> 13:57.080\nAnd then someone will, it's going to go like, well, that's because he's a celebrity.\n\n13:57.080 --> 13:58.080\nYeah.\n\n13:58.080 --> 14:02.280\nAnd, and, and, or, or, or, or they'll kind of like, they'll just repeat your joke.\n\n14:02.280 --> 14:03.280\nYeah.\n\n14:03.280 --> 14:05.440\nThey'll be like, for that matter, I can't believe Tom Cruise didn't do that.\n\n14:05.440 --> 14:07.760\nAnd it'll be like, that was my bit, you dig?\n\n14:07.760 --> 14:12.200\nThat's when, that's when I wonder if they're actually more ironically detached than me.\n\n14:12.200 --> 14:15.760\nLike they're doing a bit that's just more irritating than my bit.\n\n14:15.760 --> 14:20.160\nI would say what you're talking about women and minorities get at like times 10 on Twitter\n\n14:20.160 --> 14:23.200\nbecause people are just like, I don't think they know what they're saying.\n\n14:23.200 --> 14:24.720\nLet me explain it to them.\n\n14:24.720 --> 14:25.720\nOh yeah.\n\n14:25.720 --> 14:29.040\nWell, also there's the whole thing of, and I promise I'm not white knighting by saying\n\n14:29.040 --> 14:30.760\nthis, I think this is fucking fascinating.\n\n14:30.760 --> 14:36.440\nI just, we spend half of our time saying, wanting to debate whether women are funny.\n\n14:36.440 --> 14:41.280\nAnd then the other half of the time when women, the funny women who like therefore say things\n\n14:41.280 --> 14:46.160\nthat are crazy, sometimes that are a little inappropriate, we fuck it like, come on.\n\n14:46.160 --> 14:50.520\nWe clamp down on them like harder than any dude, right?\n\n14:50.520 --> 14:55.680\nI mean, you're biased, probably you're women, but you, but you noticed that, right?\n\n14:55.680 --> 15:00.600\nLike, like the, the, the, but is it, do you get, okay, here's, here's a question.\n\n15:00.600 --> 15:07.360\nNow, as, as women that are doing comedy, are you guys of the camp of like, oh, suck it\n\n15:07.360 --> 15:11.520\nup, buttercup, because we want to be judged on how funny we are, or are you of the camp\n\n15:11.520 --> 15:17.680\nof like, Jesus Christ, people need to realize that the perception is all out of whack.\n\n15:17.680 --> 15:18.680\nI don't want to give you that choice.\n\n15:18.680 --> 15:19.680\nWhy is there a dichotomy?\n\n15:19.680 --> 15:21.680\nThe second choice?\n\n15:21.680 --> 15:23.760\nI would say it's a little bit of both.\n\n15:23.760 --> 15:30.040\nLike on the one hand, I don't want to be judged because like, oh, I'm a woman, like, like my,\n\n15:30.040 --> 15:34.680\nmy work, because I'm a woman, I want to be judged for what I actually make.\n\n15:34.680 --> 15:38.400\nBut at the same time, it is fucking hard for women to do this, because it always becomes\n\n15:38.400 --> 15:40.320\nabout like, how did you do it?\n\n15:40.320 --> 15:45.920\nLike you don't see male comedians memoirs, the way that you see like Amy Schumer and\n\n15:45.920 --> 15:49.840\neveryone, because everyone's just like, way more obsessed with how did they do it?\n\n15:49.840 --> 15:53.240\nLike, how did they claw their way out of that womanly pile of garbage?\n\n15:53.240 --> 15:54.240\nWell, for sure.\n\n15:54.240 --> 15:57.920\nJim Belushi, like, wrote a book and said that when he was six years old, he put, he found\n\n15:57.920 --> 16:02.680\na, a, a piece of gravel up his little brother's ass, like, like, that wouldn't be coming up\n\n16:02.680 --> 16:06.520\nover and over again and every critique of everything he said on the internet.\n\n16:06.520 --> 16:10.360\nPlus you, you're an incestuous pedophile, you found gravel up your little brother's\n\n16:10.360 --> 16:11.360\nbutt.\n\n16:11.360 --> 16:12.360\nIt'd be like, no, it's Jim Belushi.\n\n16:12.360 --> 16:13.360\nIt's his book.\n\n16:13.360 --> 16:14.360\nHe probably didn't even write it.\n\n16:14.360 --> 16:19.760\nAnd like, like, like, like, like, like, I'd say other than Lena Dunham is a, is a tremendously\n\n16:19.760 --> 16:21.480\nentertaining person to me.\n\n16:21.480 --> 16:23.160\nShe's like, like, she's not a senator.\n\n16:23.160 --> 16:26.040\nShe doesn't, she doesn't, she's not going to say shit that's like, whatever, why, I'm\n\n16:26.040 --> 16:29.920\nnot trying to kiss your ass, I'm not, I don't view you as being part of a biomass with Lena\n\n16:29.920 --> 16:30.920\nDunham.\n\n16:30.920 --> 16:31.920\nTrying to put rocks in my ass.\n\n16:31.920 --> 16:32.920\nCome on.\n\n16:32.920 --> 16:33.920\nCome on, Harmon.\n\n16:33.920 --> 16:34.920\nGet your shit together.\n\n16:34.920 --> 16:35.920\nGet your shit.\n\n16:35.920 --> 16:40.200\nYou got, you got 20 minutes left to prove to these women that you're a feminist.\n\n16:40.200 --> 16:41.200\nThe meter is running.\n\n16:41.200 --> 16:42.200\nYou're waiting.\n\n16:42.200 --> 16:43.200\nTick-tock.\n\n16:43.200 --> 16:49.960\nNow, I'm kind of like, like, like in a more general sense, pulling, pulling, pulling back\n\n16:49.960 --> 16:56.480\nto just doing your, your, your, your, on a website, your parodying a cesspool, which\n\n16:56.480 --> 16:58.680\nparodies itself.\n\n16:58.680 --> 17:02.720\nDo you guys have any, are you guys like the head honchos at Reductress?\n\n17:02.720 --> 17:03.720\nYeah.\n\n17:03.720 --> 17:06.240\nSo do you guys, and did you, you, you started it as partners?\n\n17:06.240 --> 17:07.240\nYeah.\n\n17:07.240 --> 17:08.240\nYou just said, let's fucking do this.\n\n17:08.240 --> 17:09.880\nDid you have to seek out investors?\n\n17:09.880 --> 17:13.040\nI just got distracted by a whole line of questioning, but go with it.\n\n17:13.040 --> 17:14.040\nWe've been bootstrapping.\n\n17:14.040 --> 17:15.040\nYeah.\n\n17:15.040 --> 17:17.520\nSo we've just been like doing it hand to mouth for a few years.\n\n17:17.520 --> 17:19.360\nDo you monetize?\n\n17:19.360 --> 17:20.360\nWe do monetize.\n\n17:20.360 --> 17:24.680\nI don't know if you noticed though, the internet is a shit place to make money, so we make\n\n17:24.680 --> 17:29.520\nmoney doing other stuff, like events and, uh, uh, podcast as well, and, and more.\n\n17:29.520 --> 17:31.520\nBut you saw advertising and stuff?\n\n17:31.520 --> 17:32.520\nYeah.\n\n17:32.520 --> 17:33.520\nUh, the, the, okay.\n\n17:33.520 --> 17:37.240\nSo now, getting back to, so when you sat down and said, this is worth trying, it's going\n\n17:37.240 --> 17:39.200\nto be brutal because there's no way to monetize it.\n\n17:39.200 --> 17:40.200\nIt's going to fucking suck.\n\n17:40.200 --> 17:41.200\nUphill battle.\n\n17:41.200 --> 17:47.280\nDo you have a, did you, do you have like a, a comedic commission statement that makes\n\n17:47.280 --> 17:48.280\nsense?\n\n17:48.280 --> 17:49.280\nIs that a question?\n\n17:49.280 --> 17:50.280\nIs that a comedic?\n\n17:50.280 --> 17:54.400\nUh, mission statement was mostly just like women's media sucks and it doesn't represent\n\n17:54.400 --> 17:57.520\nus and we're smarter than this.\n\n17:57.520 --> 18:02.360\nTalk about the landscape unless it's going to get you in trouble, uh, like express that\n\n18:02.360 --> 18:03.360\nfrustration.\n\n18:03.360 --> 18:07.880\nLike, like when you look at the, the pre-reductors landscape of women's comedy, like what do\n\n18:07.880 --> 18:09.880\nyou see the sins being?\n\n18:09.880 --> 18:15.080\nI mean, I think the big one was the way that women's, women's magazines talk down to women\n\n18:15.080 --> 18:19.600\nand use fear and insecurity to make them buy things ultimately.\n\n18:19.600 --> 18:25.240\nAnd then later on we started seeing empowerment marketing, like the dove ads, also, uh, using\n\n18:25.240 --> 18:28.400\nempowerment and feminism in order to sell things.\n\n18:28.400 --> 18:30.480\nSo it basically all revolves around that.\n\n18:30.480 --> 18:35.480\nWhat are examples of that that we're not the, the, just like, like what woke me up more\n\n18:35.480 --> 18:41.000\nlike, like, if I see a thing and I'm a guy and I see something and it's like, uh, high\n\n18:41.000 --> 18:46.880\nfive this woman for doing this or like, like, I often, sometimes I see things and I think\n\n18:46.880 --> 18:50.280\nin the back of my head, I'm like, I'm like, that's fucking dumb.\n\n18:50.280 --> 18:54.800\nLike, like, like, if I were a woman that would make me mad, but then I don't know if it would\n\n18:54.800 --> 18:55.800\nmake you mad.\n\n18:55.800 --> 18:56.800\nIt definitely does.\n\n18:56.800 --> 18:59.960\nI think that part of the frustration was a lot of men see that and they're like, they\n\n18:59.960 --> 19:01.400\ndon't think that thing's dumb.\n\n19:01.400 --> 19:03.880\nThey think women are dumb and like that thing.\n\n19:03.880 --> 19:04.960\nThat's the fucking, okay.\n\n19:04.960 --> 19:07.840\nSo we were trying to point that out like, we're like, we don't want this.\n\n19:07.840 --> 19:08.840\nYeah.\n\n19:08.840 --> 19:09.840\nWe're not in charge of the internet.\n\n19:09.840 --> 19:10.840\nThat's really that.\n\n19:10.840 --> 19:11.840\nThat's really blowing my mind.\n\n19:11.840 --> 19:14.040\nI never, that's true.\n\n19:14.040 --> 19:15.280\nI think, but that's true.\n\n19:15.280 --> 19:20.360\nLike you have a tendency to, because we have, we have preconceived like investments emotionally.\n\n19:20.360 --> 19:24.600\nWe definitely found that out like, like, like that we, no matter who we are, that we had\n\n19:24.600 --> 19:29.440\nlike, we had stacks of poker chips in this game that we did not, no one ever made us\n\n19:29.440 --> 19:30.440\ncount.\n\n19:30.440 --> 19:37.520\nWe were like, so if somebody says, look at this body positive, uh, uh, parade marshal,\n\n19:37.520 --> 19:40.680\nuh, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like,\n\n19:40.680 --> 19:42.560\nlike, episode title.\n\n19:42.560 --> 19:47.920\nYou're like, you're like, click.\n\n19:47.920 --> 19:51.600\nThere's things that they, they, they, they're trying to get clicks in those like, so you're\n\n19:51.600 --> 19:55.680\nclicking the turnstile that's created, like includes these like attitudes.\n\n19:55.680 --> 20:01.840\nSo you can say, Charlie Sheen just started a new massage parlor and you're like, okay,\n\n20:01.840 --> 20:06.160\nyou're only clicking on it if that interests you and it only interests you if a, you're\n\n20:06.160 --> 20:10.080\na big Charlie Sheen fan or a big fan of massage, or if Charlie Sheen's a clown, do you want\n\n20:10.080 --> 20:14.360\nto like really, really like get some shit off your chest in the comment section?\n\n20:14.360 --> 20:19.880\nAnd so like the stuff that has to do with women, like it, but like that Charlie Sheen\n\n20:19.880 --> 20:24.360\nthing I never think in my head, oh, why is Charlie Sheen making me try to, you know,\n\n20:24.360 --> 20:28.720\nwhy does he want me to think things about him other than he's into massage and is a\n\n20:28.720 --> 20:29.720\ngood businessman?\n\n20:29.720 --> 20:32.560\nI'm going to go disabuse him of that notion.\n\n20:32.560 --> 20:40.680\nBut if somebody tweets like, oh, Amy Schumer's new music video does this and that, and it's\n\n20:40.680 --> 20:44.080\nnot, she doesn't get to be in charge of how her joke is being delivered.\n\n20:44.080 --> 20:49.160\nAnd then you go, and you go, I'm going to let this bitch know that women aren't funny.\n\n20:49.160 --> 20:50.160\nThank you.\n\n20:50.160 --> 21:02.120\nYeah, I mean, I, we'll be right back.\n\n21:02.120 --> 21:17.120\nI guess I kind of acted like I was teeing you guys up to say something.\n\n21:17.120 --> 21:21.880\nNo, I mean, I think, I mean, it's interesting because it seems like, you know, Charlie Sheen\n\n21:21.880 --> 21:28.120\namid all of his flaws just exists, like he is objectively existing and yet a woman is\n\n21:28.120 --> 21:33.440\njust a thing to place all of your, project all of your fears, insecurities and anger\n\n21:33.440 --> 21:34.440\non too.\n\n21:34.440 --> 21:38.640\nLike I don't, it's just seems like it's all our job to have opinions about women, but\n\n21:38.640 --> 21:40.800\nit just doesn't work the same way for men.\n\n21:40.800 --> 21:46.440\nDo you think that that's not to set you up to sound like a, like, I don't know, not\n\n21:46.440 --> 21:52.840\nto set you up to sound anyway, but, but do you think that that is localized culturally,\n\n21:52.840 --> 21:59.360\nlike chronologically, or do you think that that is like a weird, like, like crazy primate\n\n21:59.360 --> 22:05.560\ncondition that the, that, that women are scary to men and kind of like, like, and maybe\n\n22:05.560 --> 22:06.560\nscary to each other.\n\n22:06.560 --> 22:10.120\nAnd like, there's like this weird flow of energy in that direction.\n\n22:10.120 --> 22:14.640\nI think we've been conditioned by media to like fear women, especially if they're in\n\n22:14.640 --> 22:16.440\na position of power.\n\n22:16.440 --> 22:19.960\nSo like that's all the media we've seen where we see a woman in charge.\n\n22:19.960 --> 22:23.960\nShe's like a horrible boss and she sucks.\n\n22:23.960 --> 22:26.240\nAnd there's just like no examples out there.\n\n22:26.240 --> 22:30.200\nCause I think with Charlie Sheen, like he can be this garbage mess of a person.\n\n22:30.200 --> 22:31.200\nBut we love him.\n\n22:31.200 --> 22:32.200\nAnd he, we love him.\n\n22:32.200 --> 22:35.760\nAnd then in five years we could say he like fixed all his problems and people would forgive\n\n22:35.760 --> 22:40.040\nhim and he'd make a new movie and there'd be some like redemption story.\n\n22:40.040 --> 22:43.440\nBut if a woman did that, we would always be like, she's a garbage pile.\n\n22:43.440 --> 22:47.680\nIt's just Lindsay Lohan and then like, she just never comes back and it's sad.\n\n22:47.680 --> 22:48.680\nThere is a, yeah.\n\n22:48.680 --> 22:52.760\nLike I, I can look at myself and feel that like I, like from my twenties, like before\n\n22:52.760 --> 22:59.720\nI started like examining that stuff, maybe I like, like it, it's, you're punching down\n\n22:59.720 --> 23:02.880\nbefore you know, you're punching down, like you, because you think you're punching up\n\n23:02.880 --> 23:08.360\nbecause you're a guy and, and like women are just like, they're just important and, and\n\n23:08.360 --> 23:09.960\nthey didn't buy a ticket to that ride.\n\n23:09.960 --> 23:14.440\nAnd they're also not all the same thing, but to you they are because of your situation\n\n23:14.440 --> 23:20.280\nas that combined with, with, with privilege equals like the situation where it's like\n\n23:20.280 --> 23:22.200\nyou can't get out of the starting gate.\n\n23:22.200 --> 23:25.000\nIf you were to say, I'm going to be a woman and I'm going to be funny in this way.\n\n23:25.000 --> 23:27.760\nAnd it's like, yeah, why am I explaining this shit to you?\n\n23:27.760 --> 23:33.400\nI've only, there was a word for me explaining it to you that.\n\n23:33.400 --> 23:35.000\nIt does feel like punching up though.\n\n23:35.000 --> 23:39.200\nI think when you're taking down a person who's in such a high level of power, like Lena Dunham\n\n23:39.200 --> 23:41.240\nand Amy Schumer, they're like so successful.\n\n23:41.240 --> 23:45.160\nYou're like, I can make fun of them, but then at the same time you're like, as women, it's\n\n23:45.160 --> 23:46.960\nlike we only got two this year.\n\n23:46.960 --> 23:50.800\nYou know, like it's like you guys had a lot of, you know, so you're like, oh, you're taking\n\n23:50.800 --> 23:52.440\ndown our one person.\n\n23:52.440 --> 23:53.440\nYou know,\n\n23:53.440 --> 24:00.040\nI was, I was, I was, I think this is related, I swear to God, I was watching a documentary\n\n24:00.040 --> 24:06.000\nabout sex dolls and sex robots.\n\n24:06.000 --> 24:10.240\nHear them out, hear them out.\n\n24:10.240 --> 24:11.240\nThere's a couple of these.\n\n24:11.240 --> 24:13.760\nThere's a documentary about guys who have their sex dolls.\n\n24:13.760 --> 24:19.080\nThis was the thing about guys who are dedicated to the dream of inventing sex dolls, the guys\n\n24:19.080 --> 24:21.960\nwho are engineering them, and the guys who can't wait to be their first customer.\n\n24:21.960 --> 24:23.520\nI think I saw that one.\n\n24:23.520 --> 24:28.120\nAnd the thing that I think, I hope I can articulate this with, but, but, because I, I feel like\n\n24:28.120 --> 24:33.960\nI noticed this is that like every, even despite the fact that these guys are in their garage,\n\n24:33.960 --> 24:37.360\nlike making sex dolls, and then the other guys are like, I can't wait to have a sex\n\n24:37.360 --> 24:38.360\nrobot.\n\n24:38.360 --> 24:43.560\nUm, uh, they, when they get to, they, when they grace the topics of like, uh, just sex\n\n24:43.560 --> 24:47.640\nin general, even though they're supposed to be deconstructing it with, with pride and\n\n24:47.640 --> 24:54.240\nwith a lawn, they still go like, you know, as the pelvic thrusts for certain other activities,\n\n24:54.240 --> 24:55.240\nif you know what I mean.\n\n24:55.240 --> 24:59.280\nUm, and I was like, what do you mean if I know what you mean, this whole thing, there's\n\n24:59.280 --> 25:05.520\na camera crew in your garage, you're making a dickpiston, like that's like, uh, why, just,\n\n25:05.520 --> 25:07.120\njust talk like it's NASCAR.\n\n25:07.120 --> 25:11.680\nAnd here's the thing, like, like the, the guys that are waiting for the sex robots who\n\n25:11.680 --> 25:15.240\nalso talk like that, they go like, like, like, oh, and I'm looking for a certain thing.\n\n25:15.240 --> 25:16.240\nIf you know what I mean.\n\n25:16.240 --> 25:21.800\nAnd like kind of like for certain visceral topics that wouldn't by nature be offensive,\n\n25:21.800 --> 25:26.800\nthey like the, the guys that are inventing the sex robots by, by virtue of the fact that\n\n25:26.800 --> 25:31.880\nthey're making them in their garage and it's hard to make beautiful, uh, things, um, by\n\n25:31.880 --> 25:40.480\nscratch, uh, with lumber and nails, um, the, the fucking apple to E have ripped sex robots.\n\n25:40.480 --> 25:41.480\nYeah.\n\n25:41.480 --> 25:46.640\nIt's like the city to the extent that the sex robots are able to, for instance, move\n\n25:46.640 --> 25:52.960\nor talk, all of that budget in your Sim city of like what makes a sex robot, it all goes\n\n25:52.960 --> 25:57.680\naway from like physical attractiveness, kind of like it's hard to like, it's already hard\n\n25:57.680 --> 26:01.800\nto make a, a thing that looks like a beautiful human being in the first place.\n\n26:01.800 --> 26:05.200\nAnd then these guys are trying to make a thing that like acts right and talks right and goes\n\n26:05.200 --> 26:06.360\nlike this.\n\n26:06.360 --> 26:11.040\nAnd so, and so, but what I noticed for that reason is that then they would go to these,\n\n26:11.040 --> 26:16.040\nthese guys who are connoisseurs and pay it forward to connoisseurs of sex robots that\n\n26:16.040 --> 26:21.480\ndon't exist yet and, and all of them as they intercut between them talking about this guy's\n\n26:21.480 --> 26:25.120\nnew sex robot, he's like, I'm in, I'm unveiling the sex robot and it just looks like David\n\n26:25.120 --> 26:26.120\nLee Roth.\n\n26:26.120 --> 26:30.040\nAnd he's like, because he's focused on all this other functionality and the thing just\n\n26:30.040 --> 26:36.120\nlooks like your uncle in a wig and, and, and just as I'm doing right now, it's like those\n\n26:36.120 --> 26:39.000\nguys, they cut between them and all those guys that are like, if you know what I mean\n\n26:39.000 --> 26:44.800\nabout all that like stuff that has to do with their intimacy, them wanting pleasure.\n\n26:44.800 --> 26:50.400\nWhen they got to say that it's ugly, like they just relax, you can see the weight come\n\n26:50.400 --> 26:51.400\noff of their shoulders.\n\n26:51.400 --> 26:52.400\nAnd I don't know how to wear a ticket.\n\n26:52.400 --> 26:55.600\nI was like, I paused it and I was like saying, like, there's something important here because\n\n26:55.600 --> 26:59.640\nlike these guys are going like, like it's that then bringing that background to this,\n\n26:59.640 --> 27:05.160\nit doesn't feel like punching down, but you're like, you want, we want to punch down like\n\n27:05.160 --> 27:10.280\nwe have an urge and I don't, I think that probably all human beings feel that like you\n\n27:10.280 --> 27:16.040\nwe just, we all have some area where we don't, we justify it somehow, like I'll go, I'll\n\n27:16.040 --> 27:20.600\nbe like in a comment section on Jezebel and like watching under some articles like, Oh,\n\n27:20.600 --> 27:26.080\nlike here's your thing, like here's your thing where you get to call someone a piece of fucking\n\n27:26.080 --> 27:30.360\nsubhuman shit, you know, some people need to make a robot to be like, I'm out of her\n\n27:30.360 --> 27:31.360\nfucking league.\n\n27:31.360 --> 27:32.360\nYeah.\n\n27:32.360 --> 27:33.360\nYeah.\n\n27:33.360 --> 27:34.360\nThis guy's like, she's ugly.\n\n27:34.360 --> 27:38.320\nI think it's like, they started coming up and I said, I wouldn't fuck her with someone\n\n27:38.320 --> 27:42.200\nelse's dick and all this stuff and like, like, Oh, you were just, you were just winking and\n\n27:42.200 --> 27:45.720\nnudging when you were talking about your own dick, but it's like, I wouldn't fuck her with\n\n27:45.720 --> 27:46.720\nsomeone else's dick.\n\n27:46.720 --> 27:47.720\nWe're talking about someone else's dick.\n\n27:47.720 --> 27:48.720\nWe're talking about a robot.\n\n27:48.720 --> 27:49.720\nIt's like, it's ugly.\n\n27:49.720 --> 27:50.720\nIt's ugly.\n\n27:50.720 --> 27:51.720\nIt's ugly.\n\n27:51.720 --> 27:55.480\nLike we want to just like, we want to just drown each other because we feel like we're\n\n27:55.480 --> 27:56.480\ndrowning.\n\n27:56.480 --> 27:58.120\nWe want to like grab each other's heads and go like, you're ugly.\n\n27:58.120 --> 27:59.120\nYou're ugly.\n\n27:59.120 --> 28:00.120\nYou're ugly.\n\n28:00.120 --> 28:01.120\nYou're ugly.\n\n28:01.120 --> 28:02.120\nYou're ugly.\n\n28:02.120 --> 28:03.120\nI'm not drowning.\n\n28:03.120 --> 28:04.120\nI was just in Fiji and I was drowning.\n\n28:04.120 --> 28:05.120\nAll right.\n\n28:05.120 --> 28:06.120\nAll right.\n\n28:06.120 --> 28:12.360\nWell, I told you, I told you, I was a bad interviewer, I told you what I'll do.\n\n28:12.360 --> 28:13.360\nSo okay.\n\n28:13.360 --> 28:14.360\nOkay.\n\n28:14.360 --> 28:15.480\nWould you want to meet my friend Brandon Johnson?\n\n28:15.480 --> 28:16.480\nHe's black.\n\n28:16.480 --> 28:17.480\nYeah.\n\n28:17.480 --> 28:18.480\nHe's black.\n\n28:18.480 --> 28:19.480\nOkay.\n\n28:19.480 --> 28:20.480\nAll right.\n\n28:20.480 --> 28:21.480\nLet's go.\n\n28:21.480 --> 28:22.480\nOh, Brandon Johnson.\n\n28:22.480 --> 28:35.480\nI know we can't deny, trying to leave, I can't go right, soon your tired eyes go blind.\n\n28:35.480 --> 28:36.480\nOh.\n\n28:36.480 --> 28:41.480\nI think the magic's already started.\n\n28:41.480 --> 28:44.480\nWhat's up, man?\n\n28:44.480 --> 28:45.480\nWelcome.\n\n28:45.480 --> 28:46.480\nI'm so happy to be here.\n\n28:46.480 --> 28:47.480\nThanks for having me back, Dan.\n\n28:47.480 --> 28:48.480\nThank you.\n\n28:48.480 --> 28:49.480\nThank you for sharing the stage.\n\n28:49.480 --> 28:53.480\nThis sweater and this vest and the shirt, like how do you outdress me every goddamn\n\n28:53.480 --> 28:54.480\ntime?\n\n28:54.480 --> 28:57.480\nI think, what would an old-timey black man from the 30s wear?\n\n28:57.480 --> 29:04.080\nSo, you know, like, I have, have we talked about this before, you and I, I want to be\n\n29:04.080 --> 29:09.480\nlike one of those 70, 80-year-old dudes that has a kick-ass cane, you know, like a big,\n\n29:09.480 --> 29:10.480\nlike a bitching hat.\n\n29:10.480 --> 29:11.480\nYeah.\n\n29:11.480 --> 29:14.920\nAnd like just one of those cool old dudes that you see walking down the road and like,\n\n29:14.920 --> 29:18.080\nyou can pull off like a cane with like an owl head on it.\n\n29:18.080 --> 29:22.080\nI wanted to be, I wanted to be full of Jameson and a little bit of weed and a little bit\n\n29:22.080 --> 29:26.080\nof cocaine so that when I bump into some young dude and he's like, you old motherfucking,\n\n29:26.080 --> 29:28.080\nI could be like, look here, young buck.\n\n29:28.080 --> 29:30.080\nLook here.\n\n29:30.080 --> 29:35.080\nGot cocaine and marijuana, young buck.\n\n29:35.080 --> 29:38.080\nI'm not so unimpressive after all.\n\n29:38.080 --> 29:42.080\nNow, and then hit that motherfucker with my cane.\n\n29:42.080 --> 29:44.080\nI've changed my ambition.\n\n29:44.080 --> 29:49.080\nI want to be at any point in my life where I'm confident in calling anybody young blood.\n\n29:49.080 --> 29:51.080\nWhat's up, young blood?\n\n29:51.080 --> 29:53.080\nDon't pray for what you want, man.\n\n29:53.080 --> 29:57.080\nI hate young black dudes, man, because they do not.\n\n29:57.080 --> 30:00.080\nThey give you that look like, you're not cool no more.\n\n30:00.080 --> 30:01.080\nThey can smell it.\n\n30:01.080 --> 30:03.080\nYou're an old black dude.\n\n30:03.080 --> 30:04.080\nWhich is tragic.\n\n30:04.080 --> 30:08.080\nOld black woman with like, if she's standing back behind a counter and she serves you a\n\n30:08.080 --> 30:10.080\npork chop, you're like, oh, thanks, old black lady.\n\n30:10.080 --> 30:12.080\nThat's probably going to be delicious to shit.\n\n30:12.080 --> 30:19.080\nBut if an old black man in this sweater handed you a pork chop, you'd be like, fuck that.\n\n30:19.080 --> 30:23.080\nWhat did you do wrong in life?\n\n30:23.080 --> 30:27.080\nThat's a very interesting...\n\n30:27.080 --> 30:31.080\nBut thank you for the compliment.\n\n30:31.080 --> 30:35.080\nI would just say that you look like a very well-dressed, older black gentleman.\n\n30:35.080 --> 30:39.080\nI'm just trying to find out who killed Bumpy Knuckles.\n\n30:39.080 --> 30:43.080\nLike a fucking 1910 black detective.\n\n30:43.080 --> 30:49.080\nWait, is that a reference or an awesome riff of like, Ursat's black detective?\n\n30:49.080 --> 30:52.080\nYou haven't heard about the death of Bumpy Knuckles?\n\n30:52.080 --> 30:54.080\nIt's in all the papers.\n\n30:54.080 --> 30:57.080\nIs there any, is there a Charlie Chan for, but black?\n\n30:57.080 --> 31:02.080\nLike, is there like an old-timey detective archetype that was a...\n\n31:02.080 --> 31:03.080\nShaft.\n\n31:03.080 --> 31:10.080\nI'm not going to throw his detective work under the bus, but...\n\n31:10.080 --> 31:18.080\nI mean going back to Charlie Chan days when it was like, is there like a classic Uncle Ben of detecting?\n\n31:18.080 --> 31:22.080\nLike...\n\n31:22.080 --> 31:24.080\nThere isn't, right?\n\n31:24.080 --> 31:29.080\nIt's so hard, man, because I want to make up a dude for you right now.\n\n31:29.080 --> 31:36.080\nYou don't know about the work of Charles Duchase? Charles Duchase was the first black actor to play a detective.\n\n31:36.080 --> 31:39.080\nAnd arrested moments later.\n\n31:39.080 --> 31:41.080\nWait, wait, can I bring it back?\n\n31:41.080 --> 31:43.080\nSarah and Beth, I have a question.\n\n31:43.080 --> 31:47.080\nLike, just because you're women and feminists and you're making like satire and stuff like that,\n\n31:47.080 --> 31:52.080\ndo you think right now with Trump being Trump and being in office and all this stuff, do you think,\n\n31:52.080 --> 31:56.080\nand I'm hoping it's the case with the march that's going to happen and all this stuff,\n\n31:56.080 --> 32:02.080\ndo you think there will be some awesome revolution for women now?\n\n32:02.080 --> 32:11.080\nBecause it's so ridiculous that we all get to actually call this shit out and women get to be full-on vocal activists at all times.\n\n32:11.080 --> 32:18.080\nYeah, I think that like 53% of white women are finally going to latch on to 90s feminism.\n\n32:18.080 --> 32:23.080\nLike, they're going to finally catch up with the rest of the world.\n\n32:23.080 --> 32:29.080\nAnd then they're going to make some like movie about it in 20 years and everyone will be really self-satisfied.\n\n32:29.080 --> 32:33.080\nLike First Wives Club kind of.\n\n32:33.080 --> 32:37.080\nDo you think it'll be that flaccid? It'll be that fleeting and not actual?\n\n32:37.080 --> 32:46.080\nI don't think it's a bad thing. I just think that there's seriously a lot of people in this country that need to catch up with just like basic tenets of feminism.\n\n32:46.080 --> 32:55.080\nWe're not even talking about what Third Wave feminism is even about, just really basic stuff like equal pay and reproductive rights.\n\n32:55.080 --> 32:59.080\nLike birth control allows us to have jobs.\n\n32:59.080 --> 33:10.080\nJust basing it on the name, I would guess that Third Wave feminism is about diminishing the concept entirely because you can't even get through that name\n\n33:10.080 --> 33:16.080\nand getting the subconscious implication that it's fleeting and has been done before and will be done again.\n\n33:16.080 --> 33:21.080\nWho came up with that phrase? Is it Proud? Is everyone waving that flag?\n\n33:21.080 --> 33:24.080\nWho came up with it? Someone in the audience probably knows better than me.\n\n33:24.080 --> 33:27.080\nIt sounds like Archie Bunker came up with it.\n\n33:27.080 --> 33:28.080\nNo.\n\n33:28.080 --> 33:44.080\nThere's these Third Wave feminists. When you're going to realize you're just women, it doesn't matter how many waves you go through.\n\n33:44.080 --> 33:48.080\nThey're just waves. They come in, they go out.\n\n33:48.080 --> 33:51.080\nIsn't that kind of like a subconscious?\n\n33:51.080 --> 33:54.080\nYeah, we're going to go through our grunge period soon.\n\n33:54.080 --> 33:59.080\nIt'll just be called Femma Junk. Femma garbage.\n\n33:59.080 --> 34:07.080\nI hope it skips 90s grunge and goes straight to awesome punk rock, like riots and shit, like actual revolutionaries.\n\n34:07.080 --> 34:13.080\nOn record, calling for a physical, actual, prosecutable action.\n\n34:13.080 --> 34:15.080\nAlright, I'll back you up.\n\n34:15.080 --> 34:16.080\nI'm going with you.\n\n34:16.080 --> 34:21.080\nI am. I think it's time to like light time to pick up pitchforks.\n\n34:21.080 --> 34:27.080\nBecause if tweeting worked, it would get you elected president.\n\n34:27.080 --> 34:38.080\nYeah, I think it's no problem to be on Twitter. It's the world's CB radio, but a guy used it to become our first like actual evil president.\n\n34:38.080 --> 34:43.080\nLike just got on Twitter and was like,\n\n34:43.080 --> 34:52.080\nBreaker, Breaker, I should be president. And everyone that was like hashtagging cancel Colbert because that didn't work, but that did.\n\n34:52.080 --> 34:57.080\nI think that means that Twitter's probably for listening and not so much for getting stuff done.\n\n34:57.080 --> 35:01.080\nAnd then you go back to old wheat-paste flyers.\n\n35:01.080 --> 35:07.080\nWheat-paste. Put shit up on a wall that people have to see. Tell them, fucking, fucking, yeah.\n\n35:07.080 --> 35:14.080\nTake down, take down the, the live glasses. Or put them on, put them on, I mean.\n\n35:14.080 --> 35:18.080\nLook, I don't know. I'm gonna, I'm just gonna, I'm gonna.\n\n35:18.080 --> 35:22.080\nThe Dan Harmon get off my lawn segment.\n\n35:22.080 --> 35:26.080\nI'm three months from caving. Every time I have a rant on Twitter where I'm like,\n\n35:26.080 --> 35:30.080\nThis fucking president should be in jail. And then I kind of get this nausea 30 minutes later.\n\n35:30.080 --> 35:33.080\nI'm like, What are you doing? You're playing Minecraft. You're gonna get fired.\n\n35:33.080 --> 35:40.080\nYou just don't, don't, don't lip off. No one else is. What are you and Mark Hamill? What are you doing?\n\n35:40.080 --> 35:44.080\nHave you, have you, have you, have you heard what Mark Hamill's doing?\n\n35:44.080 --> 35:45.080\nYeah, the Batman song.\n\n35:45.080 --> 35:50.080\nFucking amazing. Like it's such a brilliant stroke of, like this is a great example of just like every little bit.\n\n35:50.080 --> 35:56.080\nLike, like what a great thing. Like, like to just, I'm the last person to know, but so I'm explaining to no one.\n\n35:56.080 --> 36:01.080\nBut he reads Trump's tweets in the voice of the Joker and it's fucking amazing.\n\n36:01.080 --> 36:07.080\nI was just like, Happy New Year to all my haters.\n\n36:07.080 --> 36:12.080\nAnd it's so perfect. Anyway, but, but, but, but yeah, I feel like sometimes I feel like I'm three months out from just going,\n\n36:12.080 --> 36:17.080\nWait a minute, what am I doing? I should just sit in a lawn chair, put on a red baseball cap and say,\n\n36:17.080 --> 36:23.080\nNow who loves Trump so much, they're willing to work for some minimum wage for me.\n\n36:23.080 --> 36:27.080\nLike I could just game the system. This is how Nazism works.\n\n36:27.080 --> 36:31.080\nLike you just guys like me just slowly go, I'm tired.\n\n36:31.080 --> 36:34.080\nWhen is the Women's March the 21st, right?\n\n36:34.080 --> 36:38.080\nYeah, when is, are you guys going to the Women's March? Not that I'm assuming anything because of your gender.\n\n36:38.080 --> 36:39.080\nWe're going to the one in New York.\n\n36:39.080 --> 36:40.080\nYou just look like marchers.\n\n36:40.080 --> 36:43.080\nYeah, we're just flying back. So we got to go to our own city.\n\n36:43.080 --> 36:45.080\nOh, are you based out of not LA?\n\n36:45.080 --> 36:46.080\nYeah, we're in New York.\n\n36:46.080 --> 36:47.080\nOh, we're visiting.\n\n36:47.080 --> 36:48.080\nCool.\n\n36:48.080 --> 36:50.080\nSo all major cities are doing it, right?\n\n36:50.080 --> 36:51.080\nYeah.\n\n36:51.080 --> 36:52.080\nI know Boston is.\n\n36:52.080 --> 36:53.080\nOh, I didn't know that.\n\n36:53.080 --> 37:04.080\nCody's flying to DC where an omnibus permit was taken out that prevents any marches during inauguration day to be dedicated to anything meaningful.\n\n37:04.080 --> 37:08.080\nI wanted to be a big ass fucking free for all crazy ass.\n\n37:08.080 --> 37:14.080\nLike it's going to be huge because there's like, isn't that like four times the buses, like there's 200 buses for inauguration.\n\n37:14.080 --> 37:16.080\nThere's 1200 buses for the Women's March.\n\n37:16.080 --> 37:17.080\nSo that's impressive.\n\n37:17.080 --> 37:18.080\nFuck yeah.\n\n37:18.080 --> 37:20.080\nI think it's going to be really calm though.\n\n37:20.080 --> 37:23.080\nActually, it's going to be a lot of moans.\n\n37:23.080 --> 37:24.080\nIt'll be organized and people will be listening to each other.\n\n37:24.080 --> 37:25.080\nIt'll be amazing.\n\n37:25.080 --> 37:26.080\nYeah.\n\n37:26.080 --> 37:27.080\nYeah.\n\n37:27.080 --> 37:28.080\nI hope that's the point of it.\n\n37:28.080 --> 37:31.080\nI hope it's fucking eight billion people.\n\n37:31.080 --> 37:33.080\nWell, that doesn't add up.\n\n37:33.080 --> 37:35.080\nBut yeah, that goes off without a hitch.\n\n37:35.080 --> 37:44.080\nI hope that reports start coming out of people trying to covertly stir shit up and getting exposed as fucking like, you know, that they're trying desperately to do it.\n\n37:44.080 --> 37:46.080\nBecause this is an important thing.\n\n37:46.080 --> 37:47.080\nLike here's the silver lining.\n\n37:47.080 --> 37:48.080\nLike we lost.\n\n37:48.080 --> 37:50.080\nLet's talk about left versus right.\n\n37:50.080 --> 37:51.080\nWe lost.\n\n37:51.080 --> 37:53.080\nLike, oh boohoo, that sucks.\n\n37:53.080 --> 37:56.080\nBut it's like, holy shit, we haven't lost in a long time.\n\n37:56.080 --> 38:02.080\nLike we haven't been the people that are allowed to just do anything with no accountability to logic.\n\n38:02.080 --> 38:12.080\nYou could just say the president's a fucking idiot and you should be thrown in prison and anyone that comes at you and goes like, please, I think these identity politics should be debated.\n\n38:12.080 --> 38:18.080\nYou're like, fuck you, have fun, like I'm just a fucking insurrectionist.\n\n38:18.080 --> 38:19.080\nI lost.\n\n38:19.080 --> 38:21.080\nI don't have to fucking like hang out and like obey your laws.\n\n38:21.080 --> 38:22.080\nI don't know.\n\n38:22.080 --> 38:25.080\nLike, I don't, I'm not saying like.\n\n38:25.080 --> 38:31.080\nThe sinister part of it is like when the Dixie Chicks talked shit about Bush, they were nearly fucking pilloried.\n\n38:31.080 --> 38:33.080\nLike they got a bunch of flak.\n\n38:33.080 --> 38:37.080\nNow we get to talk so much shit about Trump because he's such a buffoon.\n\n38:37.080 --> 38:47.080\nBut like that completely takes all the point of dissent and, what's the word I'm looking for?\n\n38:47.080 --> 38:48.080\nTaco.\n\n38:48.080 --> 38:49.080\nTaco.\n\n38:49.080 --> 38:52.080\nIt takes all the taco out of it.\n\n38:52.080 --> 38:56.080\nNow talking shit about the president, it doesn't even mean anything.\n\n38:56.080 --> 38:58.080\nIt doesn't land anywhere.\n\n38:58.080 --> 39:03.080\nLike dissent doesn't even matter anymore because who gives a fuck?\n\n39:03.080 --> 39:04.080\nI don't think that's true.\n\n39:04.080 --> 39:08.080\nI mean, if that's a defeatist statement, I don't agree with that.\n\n39:08.080 --> 39:09.080\nI don't think that's true at all.\n\n39:09.080 --> 39:12.080\nI think you can see these people in every comment section.\n\n39:12.080 --> 39:14.080\nMaybe I'm projecting because maybe it's what I want to see.\n\n39:14.080 --> 39:16.080\nEvery Twitter thread, everything.\n\n39:16.080 --> 39:28.080\nI can see the confusion and the fear and the frustration that used to be ours to bear now being handed over to these stump-humping redneck fuck faces.\n\n39:28.080 --> 39:35.080\nAnd they don't have the attention span we have and they're not gonna vote in 2018 because they got shit to do and be dumb about.\n\n39:35.080 --> 39:36.080\nLike they're confused.\n\n39:36.080 --> 39:39.080\nThey keep saying over and over again, why don't y'all just get back to work?\n\n39:39.080 --> 39:41.080\nI'm sorry to make them southern.\n\n39:41.080 --> 39:46.080\nLike, this is because a lot of the Trump thing is, it's not fucking like—\n\n39:46.080 --> 39:51.080\nWe got it in that—I just did it but I'm like punching down on fucking like—\n\n39:51.080 --> 39:55.400\nlike fucking, like labor, you know, but like,\n\n39:55.400 --> 39:57.960\nthere's a big part of that movement is exploitation\n\n39:57.960 --> 40:01.000\nof those people by people that are like fucking just profiting.\n\n40:01.000 --> 40:04.400\nSo, but all of those people across the board,\n\n40:04.400 --> 40:07.320\nall of that meming and tweeting and all that shit,\n\n40:07.320 --> 40:09.280\nlike that was like Snickers bar energy\n\n40:09.280 --> 40:11.960\ncompared to like the energy you have from eating a turkey.\n\n40:11.960 --> 40:15.840\nLike they can't last and they're like confused.\n\n40:15.840 --> 40:17.600\nLike they just keep going, yeah, but emails\n\n40:17.600 --> 40:19.480\nand you keep going, she lost.\n\n40:19.480 --> 40:22.640\nBack to talking about how he's a dumb fuck that can't spell\n\n40:22.640 --> 40:25.240\nand should be thrown in a hole with sharp sticks\n\n40:25.240 --> 40:29.160\non the bottom, well, but if Obama, but if Obama,\n\n40:29.160 --> 40:34.160\nnothing mother fucker, I'm talking about my president.\n\n40:35.520 --> 40:39.280\nI'm talking, like, I'm just a dumb fucking idiot\n\n40:39.280 --> 40:42.160\nthat just wants to cause trouble, ever heard of it?\n\n40:44.160 --> 40:46.640\nBut must suck to be in your,\n\n40:46.640 --> 40:48.720\nnot even in your first 100 days in office\n\n40:48.720 --> 40:51.160\nand you just got a bunch of people just clawing at you\n\n40:51.160 --> 40:54.120\nlike cats, like just spreading any rumor they can.\n\n40:54.120 --> 40:57.040\nOh God, Lou, why do you want to see my tax return so much?\n\n40:57.040 --> 40:59.160\nIt's as if I wasn't born in America.\n\n41:01.160 --> 41:03.480\nLike, will you people stop at nothing\n\n41:03.480 --> 41:06.040\nto just ruin everything?\n\n41:06.040 --> 41:06.880\nYeah!\n\n41:08.000 --> 41:09.760\nAnd it's how I always wanted to feel\n\n41:09.760 --> 41:11.640\nand it was harder when there was this handsome,\n\n41:11.640 --> 41:13.080\narticulate black guy in office\n\n41:13.080 --> 41:14.360\nthat wanted everyone to have healthcare.\n\n41:14.360 --> 41:16.160\nYeah, but there's harder.\n\n41:16.160 --> 41:17.800\nIt was hard to wake up jaded.\n\n41:17.800 --> 41:18.720\nIt was hard.\n\n41:18.720 --> 41:19.840\nNow it's easy.\n\n41:19.840 --> 41:21.640\nNow it's like the way it should be.\n\n41:21.640 --> 41:23.720\nHe's a king and a fucking idiot\n\n41:23.720 --> 41:26.680\nand I'm a fucking jester and I can just, yeah!\n\n41:26.680 --> 41:30.640\nHe's made out of smoke and cotton candy,\n\n41:30.640 --> 41:32.960\nlike, you can't throw a dart that will stick in him\n\n41:32.960 --> 41:33.840\nbecause he doesn't exist.\n\n41:33.840 --> 41:35.320\nHe's like, he's a concept.\n\n41:35.320 --> 41:37.920\nLike, you can't actually nail him on anything\n\n41:37.920 --> 41:40.560\nbecause he doesn't give a fuck about accuracy or truth.\n\n41:40.560 --> 41:41.400\nWho cares?\n\n41:41.400 --> 41:43.400\nHe does like 80 cartoonish things a day though.\n\n41:43.400 --> 41:44.760\nHe's like Scrooge McDuck.\n\n41:44.760 --> 41:48.160\nSo you're like, hey, that crazy thing you did,\n\n41:48.160 --> 41:49.640\nhe's already on to the next one.\n\n41:49.640 --> 41:50.880\nLike, he...\n\n41:50.880 --> 41:53.960\nYeah, which is brilliant because like nothing lands.\n\n41:53.960 --> 41:57.800\nLike he can just, that crazy fucking horrible dog shit.\n\n41:57.800 --> 42:00.240\nIt's not like if everyone starts talking about something,\n\n42:00.240 --> 42:02.360\nhe won't fucking obsess about it\n\n42:02.360 --> 42:04.480\nand start melting down on Twitter.\n\n42:04.480 --> 42:05.520\nHe fucking does.\n\n42:05.520 --> 42:09.080\nI think what you do is not politics, not campaign,\n\n42:09.080 --> 42:13.040\nnot policy stuff, simply talk about how he looks.\n\n42:13.040 --> 42:14.960\nJust call him chubby.\n\n42:14.960 --> 42:17.840\nIf we all agree to just call him chubby pants.\n\n42:17.840 --> 42:19.760\nI think he'd fucking blow his brains out.\n\n42:19.760 --> 42:20.720\nHe's so vain.\n\n42:20.720 --> 42:22.240\nI think you should do that\n\n42:22.240 --> 42:24.600\nbecause when you talk about how people dress\n\n42:24.600 --> 42:27.800\nand how they look, like it carries weight.\n\n42:27.800 --> 42:28.640\nLike...\n\n42:31.080 --> 42:32.360\nIt does because...\n\n42:35.160 --> 42:36.400\nBecause it's in your essence\n\n42:36.400 --> 42:39.080\nbecause people would like you to say that they dress well.\n\n42:39.080 --> 42:43.240\nI like that shirt your way.\n\n42:46.240 --> 42:47.840\nAnd I think that...\n\n42:47.840 --> 42:48.840\nI don't...\n\n42:48.840 --> 42:52.000\nI think Mark Hamill should read his tweets as the Joker\n\n42:52.000 --> 42:56.560\nand I think that Nabisco should say he's not crunchy enough.\n\n42:56.560 --> 42:58.200\nI don't...\n\n42:58.200 --> 43:00.800\nI think that if you...\n\n43:00.800 --> 43:02.960\nAnd I think that it doesn't...\n\n43:02.960 --> 43:06.960\nIf we can monetize criticism, this might actually work.\n\n43:06.960 --> 43:10.880\nOur emphasis on how things get done\n\n43:10.880 --> 43:13.160\nand whether something is going to work\n\n43:13.160 --> 43:16.680\nand whether or not a bratty kid just wants your attention\n\n43:16.680 --> 43:19.520\nand therefore you should think counter-intuitively,\n\n43:19.520 --> 43:22.880\nlike the only silver lining of this defeat\n\n43:22.880 --> 43:25.400\nand the situation we're in is that we don't have to spend\n\n43:25.400 --> 43:27.560\nthat much brain power on that shit anymore.\n\n43:27.560 --> 43:32.080\nYou can just figuratively put a frag in a bottle\n\n43:32.080 --> 43:36.400\nand light it and throw it in any general direction, figuratively.\n\n43:36.400 --> 43:39.840\nYeah, good luck with that shit.\n\n43:39.840 --> 43:43.280\nSome of us have a lot of work we got to do,\n\n43:43.280 --> 43:47.720\ndigging the trenches to live in and the caves to hide in,\n\n43:47.720 --> 43:49.280\nbut you're right.\n\n43:49.280 --> 43:52.120\nYou could just put that red hat on.\n\n43:52.120 --> 43:53.800\nI like your stance, though.\n\n43:53.800 --> 43:56.000\nYour stance is that we should fuck with this dude\n\n43:56.000 --> 43:59.080\nuntil he's up out of office, like more than ever before.\n\n43:59.080 --> 44:03.400\nAnd, Bre, you are my second of two black friends that I have.\n\n44:03.400 --> 44:06.800\nThe other one called and said they could not make it.\n\n44:06.800 --> 44:10.200\nI've had this conversation where I was like,\n\n44:10.200 --> 44:14.320\nno, dude, you don't have to, like I get it,\n\n44:14.320 --> 44:16.360\nlike I don't get it, but I get that I don't get it,\n\n44:16.360 --> 44:20.640\nand I get that it's like, I'm not gonna be like,\n\n44:20.640 --> 44:23.160\nwhat are you guys doing to women and black people,\n\n44:23.160 --> 44:25.840\nand especially not black women?\n\n44:25.840 --> 44:28.800\nBecause it's like the line was towed and all this shit,\n\n44:28.800 --> 44:30.080\nand it's like, yeah, this is a time\n\n44:30.080 --> 44:34.000\nas that Chappelle sketch on SNL, and it's like, yeah.\n\n44:34.000 --> 44:36.400\nWhite people are like fucking having to deal with frustration\n\n44:36.400 --> 44:38.800\nfor the first time in their lives.\n\n44:38.800 --> 44:43.160\nI get whatever, like take the bench, my friend.\n\n44:43.160 --> 44:44.040\nYes.\n\n44:44.040 --> 44:45.920\nI am your globetrotter.\n\n44:45.920 --> 44:48.120\nI unfortunately cannot do that as the game\n\n44:48.120 --> 44:52.760\nseems to keep coming to me, but I will say it is,\n\n44:52.760 --> 44:55.800\nif you're a historian, there's a way to look at what's\n\n44:55.800 --> 44:57.440\nabout to happen in a way that doesn't necessarily\n\n44:57.440 --> 44:58.240\nhave to get you down.\n\n44:58.240 --> 45:00.840\nIt's kind of interesting, because if you're a historian,\n\n45:00.840 --> 45:03.520\nit's one of the most interesting things to ever happen.\n\n45:03.520 --> 45:06.040\nSo like, if you don't become an activist,\n\n45:06.040 --> 45:08.920\nthere's still something interesting about being,\n\n45:08.920 --> 45:10.480\nabout paying attention to what's happening.\n\n45:10.480 --> 45:11.320\nYeah.\n\n45:11.320 --> 45:13.040\nYou know, no matter whether you're getting into it\n\n45:13.040 --> 45:15.760\nto stop it, or whether you're sitting on the sidelines,\n\n45:15.760 --> 45:17.000\nor whether you're an activist,\n\n45:17.000 --> 45:19.760\nit's still a crazy fucking time to witness.\n\n45:19.760 --> 45:23.960\nYeah, and I think with a potential healthy result,\n\n45:23.960 --> 45:29.120\nlike, because it is, I sat on this stage for four years\n\n45:29.120 --> 45:32.600\nand ran my mouth about bipartisan systems full of shit.\n\n45:32.600 --> 45:34.800\nAnd it's like, I don't know, like Keith Olberman did\n\n45:34.800 --> 45:38.320\na thing the other day where it was like, would you trade?\n\n45:38.320 --> 45:41.520\nThere's a way that we could all just vote for Mitt Romney,\n\n45:41.520 --> 45:43.760\nlike really search yourself, but like, you know what?\n\n45:43.760 --> 45:47.840\nIt's like, I'm craving the bipartisan system as comfort\n\n45:47.840 --> 45:49.560\nuntil we can figure out how to fix it.\n\n45:49.560 --> 45:51.080\nThis is not fixing it.\n\n45:51.080 --> 45:54.520\nAnd like, I have to, that's making me recognize\n\n45:54.520 --> 45:56.960\nthat all of my anarchist bullshit about like,\n\n45:56.960 --> 45:58.720\noh, the system is stupid, why do I have to choose\n\n45:58.720 --> 46:00.000\nbetween Coke and Pepsi?\n\n46:00.000 --> 46:02.240\nWell, because corn syrup isn't human urine.\n\n46:03.360 --> 46:07.120\nIt's bad for you, but it's not human urine bad for you.\n\n46:07.120 --> 46:08.880\nThat's a bad example of human urine is actually better\n\n46:08.880 --> 46:09.880\nfor you than corn syrup, right?\n\n46:09.880 --> 46:12.560\nBecause it contains water and probably human nutrients.\n\n46:12.560 --> 46:13.520\nAnd delicious.\n\n46:15.600 --> 46:17.800\nAnyways, where did we get off?\n\n46:17.800 --> 46:22.800\nAs women and comedy people, does your website have boobs?\n\n46:24.800 --> 46:25.640\nNo.\n\n46:25.640 --> 46:26.960\nActually, yes.\n\n46:26.960 --> 46:31.960\nDoes the, do you guys, like, it's like,\n\n46:34.560 --> 46:39.560\ndo you have to have conversations where you tally,\n\n46:39.840 --> 46:42.200\nlike, I'm trying to figure out, like, I wanna talk\n\n46:42.200 --> 46:43.840\nabout the comedic aspect of it,\n\n46:43.840 --> 46:46.120\nwhere comedy becomes industry,\n\n46:46.120 --> 46:50.400\nwhere it becomes like kind of where you're talking,\n\n46:50.400 --> 46:52.400\nyou have to talk about shit that's not coming from\n\n46:52.400 --> 46:54.200\njust the thing you naturally wanna do.\n\n46:54.200 --> 46:56.440\nAre you guys just following your bliss\n\n46:56.440 --> 46:58.920\nevery time someone moves to write something,\n\n46:58.920 --> 47:01.640\nor is there some kind of like restraint\n\n47:01.640 --> 47:03.440\nor guidance being put on it\n\n47:03.440 --> 47:05.520\nas what I was trying to get at before?\n\n47:05.520 --> 47:07.240\nThere's a lot of restraint.\n\n47:07.240 --> 47:12.120\nYeah, I mean, we follow our bliss to a point\n\n47:12.120 --> 47:14.520\nwhere the idea actually has to be clear and readable\n\n47:14.520 --> 47:16.320\nso that when you're scanning through Facebook or Twitter,\n\n47:16.320 --> 47:17.920\nyou're like, I get that.\n\n47:17.920 --> 47:19.160\nSo you have to have conversations like,\n\n47:19.160 --> 47:20.560\nwell, what's the joke here?\n\n47:20.560 --> 47:22.960\nAnd if it's the same as the joke in the last thing,\n\n47:22.960 --> 47:25.080\nthen, okay, let's come up with a different thing, or?\n\n47:25.080 --> 47:27.040\nYeah, we gotta, like, reign in our bliss.\n\n47:27.040 --> 47:28.480\nWe can't go that far.\n\n47:28.480 --> 47:30.440\nWhat you haven't run, if there's headlines\n\n47:30.440 --> 47:31.400\nthat you've turned down,\n\n47:31.400 --> 47:33.600\nbecause you have so many, your bylines are hilarious.\n\n47:33.600 --> 47:35.520\nAnd is there anything that you've ever been like,\n\n47:35.520 --> 47:37.240\nthat's too fucked up?\n\n47:37.240 --> 47:38.400\nAll the time.\n\n47:38.400 --> 47:40.400\nSometimes there's jokes that really appeal to us\n\n47:40.400 --> 47:41.920\nas feminists that are sort of like laughing\n\n47:41.920 --> 47:43.240\nat ourselves as feminists,\n\n47:43.240 --> 47:45.880\nbut then we're like, what will the opposition do\n\n47:45.880 --> 47:48.960\nwhen they get a hold of this sort of thing?\n\n47:48.960 --> 47:50.480\nAnd we're like, we can't put this out there,\n\n47:50.480 --> 47:53.800\nbecause it's just, a lot of like, MRA trolls\n\n47:53.800 --> 47:57.400\nwill see our articles as real, as written by real women,\n\n47:57.400 --> 47:59.560\nand obviously they hate women.\n\n47:59.560 --> 48:01.960\nSo every article we write is an example\n\n48:01.960 --> 48:03.720\nof how women are dumb and terrible\n\n48:03.720 --> 48:06.000\nbecause we're satirizing women's media.\n\n48:06.000 --> 48:10.200\nYeah, like one article we put out a couple months back,\n\n48:10.200 --> 48:13.000\nif Trump wins, I'm moving to Alaska.\n\n48:13.000 --> 48:17.160\nPeople thought it was real and made a call\n\n48:17.160 --> 48:19.120\nto get the writer fired.\n\n48:19.120 --> 48:21.400\nAnd someone wrote an open letter.\n\n48:21.400 --> 48:26.400\nI'm sorry, that's the, them taking it seriously\n\n48:26.760 --> 48:29.080\nis one thing that I've seen with the onion,\n\n48:29.080 --> 48:30.640\nthe people that take the onion thing,\n\n48:30.640 --> 48:35.000\nbut that blows my mind, the idea of like, get her fired,\n\n48:35.000 --> 48:38.520\nbecause then reductress will be all cleaned up for me.\n\n48:38.520 --> 48:43.520\nBut it's really just about punishing this woman from,\n\n48:44.000 --> 48:47.320\nyou should fire her from, it's like trying to,\n\n48:47.320 --> 48:49.560\nit's like, imagine trying to get someone fired\n\n48:49.560 --> 48:50.640\nfrom the Ku Klux Klan.\n\n48:50.640 --> 48:53.560\nIt's like, it really gives you, yeah.\n\n48:53.560 --> 48:54.640\nSure it happens.\n\n48:54.640 --> 48:57.960\nLet me show up dirty.\n\n48:57.960 --> 49:02.960\nSomeone wrote like a thousand word blog post\n\n49:03.520 --> 49:05.600\njust to articulate the fact that Alaska\n\n49:05.600 --> 49:07.120\nis in the United States.\n\n49:07.120 --> 49:09.520\nLike they're like, that was a sex robot moment.\n\n49:09.520 --> 49:13.800\nLike you really felt superior to this fictional writer.\n\n49:13.800 --> 49:15.800\nSo if everybody's just dumb,\n\n49:15.800 --> 49:18.360\nnow this is just broadening out into like, okay.\n\n49:18.360 --> 49:20.200\nI think we all agree, yeah.\n\n49:20.200 --> 49:21.360\nMost people are dumb.\n\n49:21.360 --> 49:23.320\nThe average IQ is 100.\n\n49:23.320 --> 49:27.720\nAmerica has perhaps heroically, perhaps villainously,\n\n49:27.720 --> 49:32.720\nspent its time on top reallocating assets\n\n49:32.720 --> 49:37.720\nslowly from the future educated children.\n\n49:38.520 --> 49:42.680\nLike we've been focusing on dumbness,\n\n49:42.680 --> 49:44.360\nlike we're in horse sense.\n\n49:44.360 --> 49:45.720\nWe're like, oh, we're cowboys\n\n49:45.720 --> 49:49.080\nand we're gonna rustle the doggies of the world\n\n49:49.080 --> 49:52.720\nand like who needs to care if evolution is real\n\n49:52.720 --> 49:53.720\nin order for that to happen.\n\n49:53.720 --> 49:57.200\nYou just need a lasso and a bomb.\n\n49:57.200 --> 50:02.200\nAnd so I guess as young comedy people who have no choice\n\n50:05.480 --> 50:07.880\nbut to be thinking about a wish for the world\n\n50:07.880 --> 50:11.520\nbecause you're not jaded nihilistic troll people\n\n50:11.520 --> 50:14.320\nwho are just going like, fuck you, you're stupid.\n\n50:14.320 --> 50:16.640\nAnd the world is stupid.\n\n50:16.640 --> 50:19.080\nDo you guys, is there a goal?\n\n50:19.080 --> 50:22.320\nAre we supposed to just make dumb people smart with comedy?\n\n50:22.320 --> 50:26.360\nAre we supposed to just like try to avoid getting shot?\n\n50:26.360 --> 50:28.560\nAre we supposed to like shift things\n\n50:28.560 --> 50:30.720\nso that 60 years from now in a world\n\n50:30.720 --> 50:33.800\nwe don't get to participate in, things are better?\n\n50:33.800 --> 50:36.080\nAm I overreacting to?\n\n50:36.080 --> 50:39.440\nI think we have to like dumb down our message for them\n\n50:39.440 --> 50:40.280\nin a way, because like-\n\n50:40.280 --> 50:42.120\nSimplify, we need to simplify.\n\n50:42.120 --> 50:44.320\nSimplify, like speaking to your point\n\n50:44.320 --> 50:46.040\nof like taking Trump down at all costs,\n\n50:46.040 --> 50:47.720\nlike similar to George Bush in 10 years,\n\n50:47.720 --> 50:49.560\nall these people are gonna pretend that they hated Trump\n\n50:49.560 --> 50:51.280\nand they're gonna pretend they didn't vote for him.\n\n50:51.280 --> 50:55.120\nSo like my goal is not to take down Donald Trump\n\n50:55.120 --> 50:56.600\nand convince them he has a tiny penis.\n\n50:56.600 --> 50:59.680\nLike the goal I think is to like shift their focus\n\n50:59.680 --> 51:02.600\nand be like, hey, like healthcare is good.\n\n51:02.600 --> 51:04.600\nBlack people deserve to live.\n\n51:04.600 --> 51:06.760\nLike just like focus.\n\n51:06.760 --> 51:07.800\nHilarious.\n\n51:07.800 --> 51:10.280\nSlow down, slow down.\n\n51:11.960 --> 51:13.680\nLet's take it one step at a time.\n\n51:13.680 --> 51:18.680\nAnd what's like, if you give us comedy tips,\n\n51:18.920 --> 51:22.480\nif I'm like, if I'm a satirical journalist\n\n51:22.480 --> 51:24.120\nand I'm like, I wanna do a bit,\n\n51:24.120 --> 51:25.120\nlike because there's a,\n\n51:25.120 --> 51:26.480\nyou can see it misfiring a lot.\n\n51:26.480 --> 51:29.280\nPeople think that satire means a lot of times\n\n51:29.280 --> 51:33.120\njust pretty much non-ironic kind of like sarcasm,\n\n51:33.120 --> 51:37.000\nlike sarcasm, which creates a sarcasm\n\n51:37.000 --> 51:40.000\nbetween that you're trying to,\n\n51:40.000 --> 51:41.440\nbut like there's an art.\n\n51:41.440 --> 51:43.520\nThere's a real art to like,\n\n51:43.520 --> 51:47.440\nlike like leading people around to an absurd thought\n\n51:47.440 --> 51:50.080\nthat forces them to realize something\n\n51:50.080 --> 51:51.840\nlike black people deserve healthcare,\n\n51:51.840 --> 51:54.400\nbut you don't do it by typing an article\n\n51:54.400 --> 51:57.960\nthat says, black people don't deserve healthcare.\n\n51:57.960 --> 51:58.800\nGet it?\n\n51:58.800 --> 52:02.840\nI'm not, again, I don't know why I'm explaining this to you.\n\n52:04.680 --> 52:06.240\nThe, the, my guess, my question is,\n\n52:06.240 --> 52:08.000\nis there, do you have any like little tip,\n\n52:08.000 --> 52:10.480\nlike like a fundamental philosophical kind of tip?\n\n52:10.480 --> 52:13.040\nLike, like where I'm trying to think of an example\n\n52:13.040 --> 52:15.040\nof from another field where it's like,\n\n52:15.040 --> 52:16.800\nif a welder were to say,\n\n52:16.800 --> 52:19.240\nor if a football quarterback were to say,\n\n52:19.240 --> 52:21.920\nfollow through like, like, like, or, you know,\n\n52:21.920 --> 52:24.360\njust some simple thing that when it comes to like,\n\n52:24.360 --> 52:27.040\nI, like, like parody and stuff where you're actually\n\n52:27.040 --> 52:29.120\nhoping that the end result will be somebody laughing\n\n52:29.120 --> 52:30.880\nand then also like, looking themselves,\n\n52:30.880 --> 52:34.880\nis there like a kind of guiding principle\n\n52:34.880 --> 52:39.120\nthat is separates the craftsman from the,\n\n52:39.120 --> 52:42.200\nfrom the, from the non-crafts people?\n\n52:42.200 --> 52:44.360\nI mean, this might seem really obvious saying it out loud,\n\n52:44.360 --> 52:49.360\nbut that your headline actually says what you are trying to say.\n\n52:49.480 --> 52:52.080\nLike, if you're like, okay, what's the joke of this piece?\n\n52:52.080 --> 52:53.960\nAnd you're like, well, I think it's this, this, this, this.\n\n52:53.960 --> 52:56.720\nAnd if that's not actually reflected in the headline,\n\n52:56.720 --> 52:59.160\nthen like, you wouldn't believe how many times that happens.\n\n52:59.160 --> 53:00.000\nIt's just, no.\n\n53:00.000 --> 53:02.440\nIs that a, wait, I'm not sure if you're citing a,\n\n53:02.440 --> 53:05.600\nlike, give me an example or, or clarify more,\n\n53:05.600 --> 53:07.360\nbecause I'm not sure if you're, I'm sorry.\n\n53:07.360 --> 53:09.320\nI just opened up Pandora's box.\n\n53:09.320 --> 53:10.480\nI don't know.\n\n53:10.480 --> 53:12.960\nIt's when the headline is super funny, it's a joke,\n\n53:12.960 --> 53:15.040\nbut it doesn't relate to any of the article.\n\n53:15.040 --> 53:16.360\nThe article can't back it up.\n\n53:16.360 --> 53:17.880\nSo you sort of lose steam.\n\n53:17.880 --> 53:19.760\nSo do you mean the headline kind of encapsulates\n\n53:19.760 --> 53:21.600\nthe whole bit right there, right?\n\n53:21.600 --> 53:23.560\nOr do you, but I thought you might've been saying,\n\n53:23.560 --> 53:26.360\nlike, actually the headline shouldn't even be ironic\n\n53:26.360 --> 53:27.200\nor it should be.\n\n53:27.200 --> 53:28.880\nAh, I don't know.\n\n53:28.880 --> 53:30.760\nI mean, the whole joke is there in the headline.\n\n53:30.760 --> 53:33.120\nThere's no like buried lead, basically.\n\n53:33.120 --> 53:36.040\nLike what, what you're agreeing to click on\n\n53:36.040 --> 53:37.840\nis what you're going to get in that article,\n\n53:37.840 --> 53:40.920\nunlike a lot of mainstream journalism, which currently\n\n53:40.920 --> 53:43.200\nis like, what will people click on in this headline?\n\n53:43.200 --> 53:46.640\nLet's pick one random phrase from this article.\n\n53:46.640 --> 53:48.280\nHow much are you, when you guys write something\n\n53:48.280 --> 53:50.680\nthat's like, obviously satirical or a parodic,\n\n53:50.680 --> 53:53.840\nthat are you writing and hoping,\n\n53:53.840 --> 53:56.240\nbecause like satire is not for everybody.\n\n53:56.240 --> 53:58.280\nAnd people don't know that a lot, like you're joking\n\n53:58.280 --> 54:00.240\nwhen you say, I'm moving to Alaska.\n\n54:00.240 --> 54:02.560\nThat, that, that's, that's the whole joke\n\n54:02.560 --> 54:03.640\nis in the headline there.\n\n54:03.640 --> 54:05.240\nLike that's, that's all there.\n\n54:05.240 --> 54:09.040\nAre you writing for, how, what percent are you hoping\n\n54:09.040 --> 54:13.360\nthat stupid people bite on that and write crazy blog posts\n\n54:13.360 --> 54:15.560\nand are inflamed by that?\n\n54:15.560 --> 54:17.840\nOr are you, are you hoping that everybody gets the joke\n\n54:17.840 --> 54:20.360\nand it's hilarious across the board?\n\n54:20.360 --> 54:22.400\nWe never write for the dum-dums.\n\n54:22.400 --> 54:25.760\nUh, we, we're not, we're not trying to change anyone's mind.\n\n54:25.760 --> 54:28.680\nWe're, it's usually, we're usually trying to guilt\n\n54:28.680 --> 54:30.560\nand shame the well-intentioned liberals\n\n54:30.560 --> 54:33.120\nwho are not actually fixing the problem in hand.\n\n54:33.120 --> 54:35.560\nSo like, we'll do things like, these headlines.\n\n54:35.560 --> 54:36.400\nWoo!\n\n54:36.400 --> 54:38.240\nI love that.\n\n54:38.240 --> 54:39.400\nThere's, so, we'll do-\n\n54:39.400 --> 54:40.960\nSo you mean, all of San Francisco?\n\n54:40.960 --> 54:41.800\nYeah.\n\n54:41.800 --> 54:42.920\nWoo!\n\n54:42.920 --> 54:44.960\nLike, we'll do a headline that's like,\n\n54:44.960 --> 54:46.720\nthese headlines about Black Lives Matter\n\n54:46.720 --> 54:49.080\nare breaking my heart as I scroll past them.\n\n54:49.080 --> 54:49.920\nOr something, you know?\n\n54:49.920 --> 54:53.200\nAnd it just sort of is like, a lot of them are like,\n\n54:53.200 --> 54:55.160\nhey, white women, you're not helping.\n\n54:55.160 --> 54:56.000\nYou know?\n\n54:56.000 --> 54:56.840\nRight, right, right.\n\n54:56.840 --> 54:58.920\nOr like, I can't believe this country is so racist,\n\n54:58.920 --> 55:01.120\nsays employee of all whites startup.\n\n55:01.120 --> 55:06.120\nLike, and, and I mean like, I think even in that one\n\n55:06.120 --> 55:10.040\nwas a tweak where we're never, we try to avoid making,\n\n55:11.240 --> 55:13.560\nyou know, talking about like, oh, big rich white man.\n\n55:13.560 --> 55:15.120\nBecause I think like, anyone in this room\n\n55:15.120 --> 55:17.440\ncan like point at a white rich CEO\n\n55:17.440 --> 55:18.680\nand be like, that guy sucks.\n\n55:18.680 --> 55:21.160\nWe try to kind of get it a little more specific\n\n55:21.160 --> 55:24.600\nand that specificity kind of makes us all turn inward\n\n55:24.600 --> 55:27.200\nand look at ourselves a little bit more.\n\n55:27.200 --> 55:29.240\nWe all have a little rich white man inside of us.\n\n55:29.240 --> 55:30.080\nWe do!\n\n55:30.080 --> 55:31.920\nThat's cool.\n\n55:31.920 --> 55:34.720\nI mean, that guy is just not profitable.\n\n55:34.720 --> 55:38.760\nI, I, I, I, I have one every night.\n\n55:41.360 --> 55:42.200\nRichard, they're better.\n\n55:42.200 --> 55:43.720\nHis name is Dan Harmon.\n\n55:43.720 --> 55:46.560\nI actually do, as a side note, when you guys,\n\n55:46.560 --> 55:48.720\nwhen you guys do encounter that thing where it's like\n\n55:48.720 --> 55:51.800\nsomebody, even as individuals or as reductrists,\n\n55:51.800 --> 55:55.280\nbut like, I know, when you encounter the situation\n\n55:55.280 --> 55:59.200\nwhere you accidentally snared somebody,\n\n55:59.200 --> 56:01.760\nlike you're like just doing something that was like,\n\n56:01.760 --> 56:05.280\nironic and somebody does go, like,\n\n56:05.280 --> 56:06.840\nthat makes you feel bad, doesn't it?\n\n56:06.840 --> 56:09.480\nOr not to lead you, but it makes me feel bad.\n\n56:09.480 --> 56:11.920\nLike, I feel like I just feel like I fucked up or something.\n\n56:11.920 --> 56:14.360\nSometimes it's like too true for people\n\n56:14.360 --> 56:15.880\nand you're like, I don't know,\n\n56:15.880 --> 56:18.160\nlike did I want to hurt this person?\n\n56:19.160 --> 56:21.280\nI love that some dude is sitting in his apartment like,\n\n56:21.280 --> 56:23.200\nwhy you pick on me, you know I dumb.\n\n56:27.600 --> 56:28.760\nI kind of feel that way sometimes.\n\n56:28.760 --> 56:30.920\nI feel like, I feel like, I feel like we've come\n\n56:30.920 --> 56:34.560\nas close as we've ever come in this last election\n\n56:34.560 --> 56:39.560\nwhere like, a lot of people are saying like,\n\n56:40.280 --> 56:44.000\noh, well, in a world where some of us experience shame\n\n56:44.000 --> 56:47.640\nfor not being society's ideal of beautiful,\n\n56:47.640 --> 56:48.960\nthat some people are saying,\n\n56:48.960 --> 56:50.480\nthis is not my speech about it.\n\n56:50.480 --> 56:51.960\nWe ignored the Rust Belt.\n\n56:51.960 --> 56:54.000\nFuck it, fuck them, I'm from Wisconsin,\n\n56:54.000 --> 56:55.640\nfuck that part of me.\n\n56:55.640 --> 57:00.640\nI'm just saying like, that I've had conversations\n\n57:01.920 --> 57:05.600\nwith who I thought were smart friends of mine\n\n57:05.600 --> 57:09.960\nthat were like, yeah, but I'd rather him than Hillary\n\n57:09.960 --> 57:12.080\nand like you go down this road and like,\n\n57:12.080 --> 57:14.920\nyou always come down to this like little channel\n\n57:14.920 --> 57:16.440\nthat's filled with like little rats\n\n57:16.440 --> 57:20.800\nand bits of newspaper, but there's like this fundamental\n\n57:20.800 --> 57:24.640\nalmost chagrinning honesty about how it's\n\n57:24.640 --> 57:27.040\nan anti-intellectual revolution.\n\n57:27.040 --> 57:30.600\nThat all of this, like that shaming people\n\n57:30.600 --> 57:35.160\nabout punctuation and not understanding the world\n\n57:35.160 --> 57:39.520\nand things like that, what is my point?\n\n57:39.520 --> 57:41.920\nIt's only an observation, it's not about,\n\n57:41.920 --> 57:44.240\nwe didn't do fucking shit wrong, we're good people.\n\n57:44.240 --> 57:46.200\nI'm not saying that at all, that's not my thesis.\n\n57:46.200 --> 57:47.840\nI just like, I think it's an interesting observation\n\n57:47.840 --> 57:51.880\nthat we've come as close as we ever have in our life\n\n57:51.880 --> 57:53.840\nof a group of Americans saying like,\n\n57:53.840 --> 57:56.840\nI've been feeling dumb because I'm dumb for a long time\n\n57:56.840 --> 57:59.640\nand I was just hoping maybe dumb people could be in control.\n\n57:59.640 --> 58:04.640\nLike they dressed that up when Bush, with the Bush thing,\n\n58:04.920 --> 58:07.160\nthey used to dress that up and that they're getting closer\n\n58:07.160 --> 58:10.240\nand closer to just going dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb.\n\n58:10.240 --> 58:12.400\nI read this article that was pretty interesting\n\n58:12.400 --> 58:17.400\nthat was about how the Trump election is kind of similar\n\n58:18.160 --> 58:22.400\nto Insane Clown Posse followers, the juggalos,\n\n58:22.400 --> 58:25.600\nwhere they've created this community\n\n58:25.600 --> 58:28.560\nthat basically exists to say fuck you to anything\n\n58:28.560 --> 58:31.160\nthat would say fuck you to my community.\n\n58:31.160 --> 58:34.680\nAnd so in doing, they've kind of created this armor\n\n58:34.680 --> 58:37.600\nwhere it's like anything can be used\n\n58:37.600 --> 58:40.240\nto then justify their own means\n\n58:40.240 --> 58:43.000\nbecause their whole premise was just out of anger\n\n58:43.000 --> 58:47.160\nand resentment of just, almost the same kind of things\n\n58:47.160 --> 58:49.000\nthat we have anger and resentment for,\n\n58:49.000 --> 58:50.280\nbut just other things too.\n\n58:50.280 --> 58:54.040\nIt's almost as if the municipal communities,\n\n58:54.040 --> 58:56.560\nplaces in port cities, places, the nerve centers\n\n58:56.560 --> 58:59.000\nof the giant animal called the country\n\n58:59.000 --> 59:03.000\nthat are often dismissed and don't have electoral power\n\n59:03.000 --> 59:04.800\nbecause they're city slickers.\n\n59:04.800 --> 59:09.360\nLike they're folded over on themselves eight times,\n\n59:09.360 --> 59:10.400\nwhich is the maximum.\n\n59:10.400 --> 59:12.040\nAnd so they're all in contact with each other\n\n59:12.040 --> 59:13.160\nin a big sandwich.\n\n59:13.160 --> 59:15.200\nSo even if they do have a low IQ,\n\n59:15.200 --> 59:19.280\nthey have a snobbishness to them when it comes\n\n59:19.280 --> 59:22.080\nto what you say to an Indian man\n\n59:22.080 --> 59:23.680\nwhen you meet him at the deli.\n\n59:25.080 --> 59:26.720\nAnd then you're in these other states\n\n59:26.720 --> 59:28.720\nwhere the electoral power is so high.\n\n59:28.720 --> 59:30.520\nAnd the positive way of looking at it\n\n59:30.520 --> 59:33.040\nisn't so much like, oh, they're trying to take over.\n\n59:33.040 --> 59:36.800\nThey wish that the whole country was a cattle ranch\n\n59:36.800 --> 59:41.800\nor a welding factory where you make welding.\n\n59:41.800 --> 59:46.800\nWhat they're actually saying is, oh, first fold.\n\n59:48.280 --> 59:49.400\nWeird.\n\n59:49.400 --> 59:51.280\nWe're like, we're out of the eighth fold.\n\n59:51.280 --> 59:54.280\nAnd they're like, it's weird to be folded\n\n59:54.280 --> 59:56.040\nbecause the internet folded them.\n\n59:56.040 --> 59:58.240\nSo they're having their first experiences\n\n59:58.240 --> 01:00:03.240\nwith things that you learn if you go to college in a big city.\n\n01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:08.240\nIf you go from the Midwest to the nearest big city\n\n01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:13.240\nand as you follow that path,\n\n01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:18.240\nif I could just show you at Elbrick's Defending Your Life\n\n01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:21.240\nmontage of how dumb I've been\n\n01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:24.240\nand how the dumb things are like,\n\n01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:27.240\nit didn't stop five minutes ago in the green room.\n\n01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:29.240\nI'm just like, like meeting you guys, I'm just babbling.\n\n01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:31.240\nI'm just like trying to figure out\n\n01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:33.240\nwhat I'm eating, you guys, I'm just babbling.\n\n01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:35.240\nI'm just like trying to prove I'm a good person.\n\n01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:38.240\nImagine the shame of being just a dumb shit.\n\n01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:42.240\nJust a big, dumb shit bucket eating fucking moron\n\n01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:47.240\nfrom a fucking town full of 800 fucking idiot.\n\n01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:49.240\nHe eats the shit bucket.\n\n01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:50.240\nHe doesn't even eat the shit.\n\n01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:52.240\nHe eats the whole bucket.\n\n01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:54.240\nThere's a shame there.\n\n01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:56.240\nI think shame's our biggest problem.\n\n01:00:56.240 --> 01:00:59.240\nI think it's white fragility and male fragility in a nutshell\n\n01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:01.240\nbecause it's like, when you tell someone,\n\n01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:04.240\nhey, the thing you guys always do hurts me as a person.\n\n01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:06.240\nThey experience a tiny fraction of that pain.\n\n01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:08.240\nThey're like, oh, I hurt someone.\n\n01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:12.240\nWell, the part that I just heard was the thing you guys always do.\n\n01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:16.240\nAnd I was processing and I was like, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you.\n\n01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:19.240\nWell, you're telling me that it hurts you.\n\n01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:22.240\nBut in a lot of instances, you're like, hey, the thing you do kills us.\n\n01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:25.240\nAnd then they're like, that hurts our feelings for you to say that.\n\n01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:30.240\nAnd you're like, but on our side, that's a little bit bigger.\n\n01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:34.240\nMicrocosm is every relationship where,\n\n01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:37.240\nbecause I just had one tonight where it's like,\n\n01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:41.240\nI didn't have a fight with my girlfriend, but we had a thing.\n\n01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:45.240\nIt's like, we love each other so much that any turbulence\n\n01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:51.240\ncauses a conversation of, if someone were to express a need,\n\n01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:55.240\nif someone were to say, oh, I'm dissatisfied in this area.\n\n01:01:55.240 --> 01:01:59.240\nWhen I hear that, unless I'm fucking on point and sober\n\n01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:02.240\nand ready for anything and have just finished breathing four times,\n\n01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:06.240\ntaking four second breaths and have a big mouthful of peanut butter\n\n01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:09.240\nand I got a sheep on my dick.\n\n01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:12.240\nI don't know what my idea I'm in a hammock.\n\n01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:16.240\nWhatever the ideal is, unless those ideal situations are met,\n\n01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:22.240\nI'm bound to hear your dissatisfaction as,\n\n01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:24.240\nI fucked up, I fucked up.\n\n01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:29.240\nNow, it's easy to, when you look back on it after your autonomic system cools down,\n\n01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:32.240\nwe always look back and go, oh, that person told me I fucked up.\n\n01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:38.240\nAnd wow, they must really give a fuck to tell me that.\n\n01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:45.240\nAnd also, my ability to say I fucked up is actually pretty cool, sexy, alpha.\n\n01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:50.240\nBut in that moment, you're like, I'm always like,\n\n01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:53.240\nI didn't fuck up, I didn't fuck up.\n\n01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:56.240\nYou should know, okay, maybe I did fuck up,\n\n01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:59.240\nbut that definitely pales in comparison to your fuck ups.\n\n01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:03.240\nEven just telling me I fucked up is kind of a fuck up if you think about it.\n\n01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:07.240\nThere's just this like scramble and it's a panic that is equivalent to\n\n01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:10.240\nwhen you're drowning, it's fight or flight.\n\n01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:12.240\nAnd there's something romantic about that,\n\n01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:16.240\nwhen you're feeling fight or flight, don't shake your head, Brandon.\n\n01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:20.240\nAt the heart of it, at the heart of it all is like,\n\n01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:22.240\nwhy would you pan?\n\n01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:27.240\nIt's like, if you watch like a war movie about Nazis,\n\n01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:29.240\nlike they're herding people into a camp,\n\n01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:33.240\nthere's not a ton of like, ow, my shoes hurt.\n\n01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:36.240\nWhat the fuck are you saying that for? I'm a fucking good Nazi.\n\n01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:40.240\nThey're like not hearing them and not looking at them as humans.\n\n01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:44.240\nAnd there's like, there is a place you can get to where hatred and\n\n01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:46.240\nand privilege and all of the things that we're struggling with,\n\n01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:49.240\nlike get to a place where it's like, holy shit, it's really bad.\n\n01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:55.240\nAnd right now for it to be in a place of people freaking out all the time,\n\n01:03:55.240 --> 01:03:59.240\nlike the fact that the internet is a goddamn fucking like cesspool\n\n01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:04.240\nis because like we're getting hurt by each other\n\n01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:07.240\nand half of us were 20% of us or whatever are getting hurt by the idea\n\n01:04:07.240 --> 01:04:09.240\nthat we've been doing it wrong the whole time.\n\n01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:11.240\nWe're just going to make you happy.\n\n01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:13.240\nThis is my world I made for you ladies.\n\n01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:17.240\nI think a lot of us have the impulse to be like, hey, I didn't mean to do that\n\n01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:19.240\nand we really want to prove it to them, but it's like.\n\n01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:21.240\nI didn't mean to call me a slut.\n\n01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:26.240\nI just wanted you to know I was, I just like wanted a fair wages.\n\n01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:30.240\nI think the fact that someone would bring the point up to you\n\n01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:33.240\nis them knowing that you didn't mean to, like they already know that.\n\n01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:35.240\nSo we get caught in this trap of trying to prove to them\n\n01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:38.240\nthat like we're a good person who wouldn't intentionally hurt them.\n\n01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:40.240\nAnd it's like that's beside the point to them.\n\n01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:42.240\nThey're just trying to tell you to stop doing it.\n\n01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:47.240\nAnd it's hard because it every human being shares this.\n\n01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:49.240\nI think primatological.\n\n01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:55.240\nThere is a surf curl or a wind that gets in your sail.\n\n01:04:55.240 --> 01:04:59.240\nThe moment when you it's self righteousness or just not even self righteousness.\n\n01:04:59.240 --> 01:05:03.240\nThat sounds pejorative righteousness when you truly are right.\n\n01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:06.240\nIt's not fabricated that you are right.\n\n01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:09.240\nLike that's when we, a lot of us break down.\n\n01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:16.240\nI, I, my heroes are people, the people that have changed me are people\n\n01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:21.240\nwho have been right and have taken mercy on me and been like, Hey man,\n\n01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:24.240\nlike, like you should know you're wrong and I'm right.\n\n01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:28.240\nBut like that they like come in somehow lower and I don't know.\n\n01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:31.240\nI don't even know how they did it, but like I've had these experiences where I'm like,\n\n01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:35.240\nI would have just argued about this shit and like been this way.\n\n01:05:35.240 --> 01:05:40.240\nIf it weren't for this one person, this anonymous person on Twitter or, or it's some,\n\n01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:44.240\nsome, some flame war that was like, it's 9 11 everybody.\n\n01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:51.240\nAnyway, but, but, but yeah, it's, it's, it's, it's a, it's a dangerous mechanism\n\n01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:58.240\nin all of us that we, I think when we feel, when we feel correct, when we feel right,\n\n01:05:58.240 --> 01:06:04.240\nwe, there's like a Newtonian law there that like puffs us up more and then\n\n01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:09.240\nand then it creates this syndrome because when, when you feel wrong, you have a,\n\n01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:13.240\nyou have a defensive reaction and then when you feel right, you have an aggressive reaction.\n\n01:06:13.240 --> 01:06:16.240\nMaybe that's me describing men. I don't think so though.\n\n01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:21.240\nI, I have a theory now that we've all been emotionally abused by probably our parents\n\n01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:22.240\nor someone.\n\n01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:23.240\nI like that theory.\n\n01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:29.240\nAnd then our, our coping mechanism going forward is like it's either fight or flight.\n\n01:06:29.240 --> 01:06:33.240\nSo in certain situations, we just become the abuser because we're like,\n\n01:06:33.240 --> 01:06:36.240\nI'm the right one here. You know, we're, it's a way of taking control.\n\n01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:40.240\nI think in chaotic households, which should describe 100% of households,\n\n01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:44.240\neven if you think you lived in a beaver cleaver like household, I think you're a kid.\n\n01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:45.240\nSo it's chaotic.\n\n01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:48.240\nI do think it's like, you have these like tyrants who are going to say,\n\n01:06:48.240 --> 01:06:51.240\nbecause I said so and they're going to be like, and I think the moments that we,\n\n01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:56.240\nthat dopamine spike us and evolve us are the moments we stand up to them and prove them wrong.\n\n01:06:56.240 --> 01:06:58.240\nI, I, I at least I should just be for myself.\n\n01:06:58.240 --> 01:06:59.240\nI mean, that was my household.\n\n01:06:59.240 --> 01:07:06.240\nIt was like, I don't, I didn't learn, I didn't like, like learn that the more I could roll\n\n01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:09.240\nover the more freedom I got at all.\n\n01:07:09.240 --> 01:07:12.240\nLike my curfews got extended by fucking monologues.\n\n01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:19.240\nLike, like, like my, my, my posture improved like every, like it was like all my leveling\n\n01:07:19.240 --> 01:07:25.240\nup what it had to do with like the moment I finally lost my shit and fucking like proved\n\n01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:30.240\nsomeone wrong, emulating what they, the weapons they would use against me, which were like\n\n01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:34.240\nyelling and shaming and toxifying and all that stuff.\n\n01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:38.240\nAnd it's, that's the, that's the, I guess that's what we're all up against is because\n\n01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:43.240\nour whole species is descended from a one big dysfunctional family that was reproductively\n\n01:07:43.240 --> 01:07:44.240\nsuccessful.\n\n01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:49.240\nLike we, we don't give ourselves enough credit biologically for being primate that grew up\n\n01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:55.240\nin God's crosshairs and yet beat the fuck out of giraffes and ants.\n\n01:07:55.240 --> 01:08:00.240\nWe are going to the fucking outer space and, and, and when we do, if you were a good giraffe\n\n01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:04.240\nyou can come with, we'll think about it.\n\n01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:08.240\nIt was not a good solution to grow a longer neck because you couldn't reach leaves.\n\n01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:10.240\nIt's dumb.\n\n01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:12.240\nYou thought you nailed it.\n\n01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:14.240\nYou would have fucking eaten us if you had evolved past that.\n\n01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:15.240\nYou would have fucking eaten us.\n\n01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:17.240\nWe're eating you.\n\n01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:18.240\nYou don't even taste good.\n\n01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:22.240\nYou just got, you're all neck.\n\n01:08:22.240 --> 01:08:24.240\nAnd you can't talk.\n\n01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:26.240\nFamous for their necks.\n\n01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:28.240\nCan't talk.\n\n01:08:28.240 --> 01:08:30.240\nYou hate, you hate giraffes so much.\n\n01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:37.240\nSomewhere along the line where I'm growing a longer neck, maybe I should add some larynxes\n\n01:08:37.240 --> 01:08:45.240\nso I could say, hey, anyone have any ideas about how to build a ladder?\n\n01:08:45.240 --> 01:08:51.240\nIt's laziness. We, what my point is, we don't earn this through our choices every day.\n\n01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:54.240\nHave you ever met a giraffe? Have you ever been in the company of one?\n\n01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:58.240\nDon't interrupt me. It irritates me.\n\n01:08:58.240 --> 01:09:04.240\nWe, we didn't earn any of this, but it also is recognizable.\n\n01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:11.240\nLike, as a species, we fucking like, we, we are the biggest success on the planet until\n\n01:09:11.240 --> 01:09:15.240\nyou get to the part where we're so successful that the planet may then fail.\n\n01:09:15.240 --> 01:09:21.240\nBut like, as individual human beings, then we don't, fuck, I had it.\n\n01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:25.240\nI fucking had it. I had the meaning of life right in my fucking hand.\n\n01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:26.240\nGod damn it.\n\n01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:30.240\nI want my tail back if we're so successful.\n\n01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:34.240\nWe lost tails because we got so big in fact because we were like fucking nailing it.\n\n01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:36.240\nWe used to be like squirrels.\n\n01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:42.240\nYou just, if you back us up all the way to assuming we all came from one amoeba, we represent\n\n01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:45.240\nthe part of that amoeba's family that was like peace.\n\n01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:47.240\nLike, we're awesome.\n\n01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:52.240\nSee, and all the other fucking amoeba siblings are like, well, I'll think I'll be an amoeba\n\n01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:55.240\nthat grows an amoeba shirt.\n\n01:09:55.240 --> 01:09:58.240\nAnd we were like, I think I'll be a fucking monkey.\n\n01:09:58.240 --> 01:10:01.240\nAnd they're like, you think you're better than me now?\n\n01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:03.240\nFucking smart amoeba.\n\n01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:07.240\nI don't want the tail. I don't want the tail. I want that toe thumb where you can fucking\n\n01:10:07.240 --> 01:10:09.240\ngrab on to shit with your foot.\n\n01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:11.240\nAnd super strength.\n\n01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:12.240\nRemember that shit?\n\n01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:15.240\nYou can just fucking hang out upside down and be like, I'm fine like this.\n\n01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:18.240\nOh yeah, we had one. Here's what it doesn't protect you from.\n\n01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:23.240\nYour cousin's becoming nuclear capable.\n\n01:10:23.240 --> 01:10:27.240\nSorry, toe thumb.\n\n01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:28.240\nI've got.\n\n01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:29.240\nWhy are those mutually exclusive?\n\n01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:33.240\nWhy can't I be good at nuclear physics and also have a toe thumb?\n\n01:10:33.240 --> 01:10:36.240\nTurns out you can't.\n\n01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:41.240\nIf we don't blow ourselves up, we may get to a point where we can upload our consciousness\n\n01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:43.240\ninto a simulation of having toe thumbs.\n\n01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:46.240\nWe're almost there. We're almost there.\n\n01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:51.240\nWe just got a couple more little conniption fits to get through.\n\n01:10:51.240 --> 01:10:54.240\nGod, I swear to God, I had a fucking point.\n\n01:10:54.240 --> 01:10:57.240\nI was going to stitch the giraffe thing to a thing.\n\n01:10:57.240 --> 01:10:59.240\nIt was going to blow your mind.\n\n01:10:59.240 --> 01:11:03.240\nYou were mad about giraffes because they got it wrong and they should have had a ladder.\n\n01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:05.240\nYeah, and why I know that.\n\n01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:09.240\nNo, he's right about the ladder part. That part was great.\n\n01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:13.240\nNow, what I was saying before that was, it was harping about something that I was like,\n\n01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:17.240\nlike then I got off on this thing that I'm like, I've said a thousand times, but I was like.\n\n01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:19.240\nAll right, so.\n\n01:11:19.240 --> 01:11:21.240\nWe should build a wall.\n\n01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:22.240\nWe should build a wall.\n\n01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:24.240\nDid you see the photo of the guy and that's the wall?\n\n01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:27.240\nAll right, anyways.\n\n01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:31.240\nYou're going to want those giraffes on the wall when the wall happens, man.\n\n01:11:31.240 --> 01:11:42.240\nYou're going to need someone to fucking see what's going on the other side.\n\n01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:46.240\nYou're going to fucking eat your fucking words about giraffes.\n\n01:11:46.240 --> 01:11:48.240\nYou remember Gladiator?\n\n01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:53.240\nThey have a shot where you can see your giraffes like being loaded into the Colosseum's loading dock,\n\n01:11:53.240 --> 01:11:56.240\nbut they don't have the scene where people are like killing giraffes,\n\n01:11:56.240 --> 01:12:00.240\nwhich is what they used to do because they were like, holy shit, look at these monsters with long necks.\n\n01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:05.240\nWe should have eight of them fight Doug.\n\n01:12:05.240 --> 01:12:08.240\nAnd Doug would be like, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:12.240\nAnd the giraffes would be like, are you fucking kidding me?\n\n01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:14.240\nI got a long neck here.\n\n01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:15.240\nI did everything I'm supposed to do.\n\n01:12:15.240 --> 01:12:17.240\nI'm not a horse for God's sake.\n\n01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:19.240\nI got a long neck.\n\n01:12:19.240 --> 01:12:23.240\nAnd we're like, we have bronze, you're dead, and it's not fair to you.\n\n01:12:23.240 --> 01:12:25.240\nA giraffe will fuck you up or kick you.\n\n01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:27.240\nThey'll fucking wrap you with their head.\n\n01:12:27.240 --> 01:12:28.240\nThey don't fuck about.\n\n01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:30.240\nYou know, you don't want to fight a zebra.\n\n01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:32.240\nA zebra will fucking get you.\n\n01:12:32.240 --> 01:12:33.240\nLook, everything will get me.\n\n01:12:33.240 --> 01:12:34.240\nA giraffe would kick my ass.\n\n01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:37.240\nI'm not a Gladiator.\n\n01:12:37.240 --> 01:12:41.240\nI wouldn't want to be in a ring with a giraffe even with a sword.\n\n01:12:41.240 --> 01:12:43.240\nHe's going to walk on your face.\n\n01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:45.240\nI don't want to.\n\n01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:49.240\nWho do you want to be in a ring with a sword with?\n\n01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:50.240\nCrocodile.\n\n01:12:50.240 --> 01:13:00.240\nJust say if you had said a feminist parody news site editors.\n\n01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:01.240\nWhy would I say that?\n\n01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:05.240\nBecause our podcast would have taken a huge turn for clicks.\n\n01:13:05.240 --> 01:13:06.240\nIt would have been amazing.\n\n01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:08.240\nIf I said I wanted to kill feminists.\n\n01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:09.240\nIt would have gotten you a wooden sword.\n\n01:13:09.240 --> 01:13:10.240\nIt would have gone into it.\n\n01:13:10.240 --> 01:13:12.240\nIt would have been a huge charity event.\n\n01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:13.240\nHere's what I would do.\n\n01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:17.240\nIf I could go back in time, if I could be in a ring with anybody with an actual sword,\n\n01:13:17.240 --> 01:13:20.240\nNero, who used to make people fight him with fake swords.\n\n01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:22.240\nIt's like, no, fight me with a real sword.\n\n01:13:22.240 --> 01:13:24.240\nYou piece of shit.\n\n01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:30.240\nWhat about an ugly sex robot?\n\n01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:34.240\nI would fuck a sex robot that looked like David Lee Roth.\n\n01:13:34.240 --> 01:13:38.240\nJust because...\n\n01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:40.240\nJust for that.\n\n01:13:40.240 --> 01:13:45.240\nI brought my pencil.\n\n01:13:45.240 --> 01:13:49.240\nHey, man, you came on my face.\n\n01:13:49.240 --> 01:13:53.240\nI would do it just for that.\n\n01:13:53.240 --> 01:13:56.240\nIt was just like a sound board, like a ways thing.\n\n01:13:56.240 --> 01:14:01.240\nOh, you had a shack one where it's like, why would you scum my face?\n\n01:14:01.240 --> 01:14:04.240\nEase the seat back.\n\n01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:09.240\nMy friend Matt Young thought the lyrics were,\n\n01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:11.240\nI can barely see the roads, all the heat coming off it.\n\n01:14:11.240 --> 01:14:13.240\nReach down between my legs.\n\n01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:15.240\nEase the seat back.\n\n01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:18.240\nHe thought it was ease the seat back.\n\n01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:23.240\nSo David Lee Roth is a farmer on a tractor in his mind.\n\n01:14:23.240 --> 01:14:25.240\nEase the seat back.\n\n01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:27.240\nWave to Yahshua.\n\n01:14:27.240 --> 01:14:30.240\nI reached down between my legs and ease the seat back.\n\n01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:33.240\nI was like, you thought that was on the fucking air on the radio?\n\n01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:35.240\nI showed you guys today for the longest time.\n\n01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:38.240\nI don't know when I figured out that it wasn't the case.\n\n01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:43.240\nBut the phrase blow your wad was exclusively sexual\n\n01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:46.240\nand was so grossed out that mainstream media would just use it\n\n01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:51.240\nthat CNN would go like, oh, the Clinton campaign may have blown its wad on the thing.\n\n01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:54.240\nI'd be like, gross, what are you talking about?\n\n01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:56.240\nJipe on a thing.\n\n01:14:56.240 --> 01:14:57.240\nWhat?\n\n01:14:57.240 --> 01:15:02.240\nAnd then I realized it's like, oh, it's like a wad of cash.\n\n01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:07.240\nI was like, how are people saying blow your wad all the time?\n\n01:15:07.240 --> 01:15:08.240\nIt's so gross.\n\n01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:09.240\nIt's like pearl jam.\n\n01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:12.240\nAnd you can learn what pearl jam is and you're like, gross, stop it.\n\n01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:13.240\nWhat do you eat?\n\n01:15:13.240 --> 01:15:15.240\nI have to hear your name all the time.\n\n01:15:15.240 --> 01:15:17.240\nWait, wait, what the fuck?\n\n01:15:17.240 --> 01:15:18.240\nPearl jam is...\n\n01:15:18.240 --> 01:15:19.240\nWhat is...\n\n01:15:19.240 --> 01:15:20.240\nNo, that's pearl neck.\n\n01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:21.240\nNot that I know.\n\n01:15:21.240 --> 01:15:22.240\nWell, it's...\n\n01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:23.240\nNo, well, no.\n\n01:15:23.240 --> 01:15:27.240\nI gestured to my decolletage, but I...\n\n01:15:27.240 --> 01:15:28.240\nNo, that's even...\n\n01:15:28.240 --> 01:15:29.240\nIt's even grosser.\n\n01:15:29.240 --> 01:15:30.240\nPearl jam.\n\n01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:31.240\nIt's fucking...\n\n01:15:31.240 --> 01:15:32.240\nYeah, pearl jam.\n\n01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:33.240\nGross.\n\n01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:36.240\nYou mean somebody takes, come and puts it in a jar and makes jam?\n\n01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:37.240\nIs that an actual...\n\n01:15:37.240 --> 01:15:40.240\nNo, it's a way of referring to your fucking gross, pearly cum.\n\n01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:42.240\nIs that an actual thing?\n\n01:15:42.240 --> 01:15:43.240\nAre you making that up?\n\n01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:45.240\nThey don't like it.\n\n01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:50.240\nIt's a bit.\n\n01:15:50.240 --> 01:15:56.240\nCheck this motherfucker for a suicide vest.\n\n01:15:56.240 --> 01:16:00.240\nDon't you never stand up in a comedy show like that.\n\n01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:01.240\nCheck him for a vest.\n\n01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:02.240\nIs that a vest?\n\n01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:03.240\nYeah, it's a vest.\n\n01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:04.240\nI should...\n\n01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:05.240\nPlease don't kill us.\n\n01:16:05.240 --> 01:16:06.240\nAll right.\n\n01:16:06.240 --> 01:16:07.240\nThank you, Abba.\n\n01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:10.240\nThank you for saving pearl jam for me and everyone in this room.\n\n01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:12.240\nYou thought pearl jam was a cum reference?\n\n01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:13.240\nI really...\n\n01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:14.240\nMaybe I projected that?\n\n01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:18.240\nDid I come up with a name for cum and like make it pearl jam's fault?\n\n01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:19.240\nI think you did.\n\n01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:20.240\nAll right.\n\n01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:21.240\nI accept that.\n\n01:16:21.240 --> 01:16:22.240\nI mean...\n\n01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:25.240\nI was like, what the fuck do I not know about?\n\n01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:29.240\nYou would never spread pearl jam on toast?\n\n01:16:29.240 --> 01:16:31.240\nWell, I'm not ashamed of that projection.\n\n01:16:31.240 --> 01:16:33.240\nThat just makes me imagine it of like Vonokin or something.\n\n01:16:33.240 --> 01:16:36.240\nI didn't like market it.\n\n01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:39.240\nBut the important thing is, Abba, thank you.\n\n01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:44.240\nPearl jam, if you're listening, you're off the hook.\n\n01:16:44.240 --> 01:16:48.240\nThat ant story to me sounds like something they just said in interviews in the 90s.\n\n01:16:48.240 --> 01:16:49.240\nWhat was the ant story?\n\n01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:50.240\nI wasn't even listening.\n\n01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:52.240\nAll I heard was that it was wrong.\n\n01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:54.240\nThat their ant pearl made really good jam.\n\n01:16:54.240 --> 01:16:55.240\nOh.\n\n01:16:55.240 --> 01:16:57.240\nThey made a good jam, so they call it pearl jam.\n\n01:16:57.240 --> 01:16:58.240\nBut then...\n\n01:16:58.240 --> 01:16:59.240\nOkay, so...\n\n01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:00.240\nAll right.\n\n01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:01.240\nYeah, you're right.\n\n01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:04.240\nSo they could explain their name in interviews.\n\n01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:05.240\nYeah.\n\n01:17:05.240 --> 01:17:06.240\nAll right.\n\n01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:07.240\nAll right.\n\n01:17:07.240 --> 01:17:10.240\nAlso, yeah, the Beatles said they were losing this guy with diamonds, wasn't LSD or some\n\n01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:11.240\nother shit.\n\n01:17:11.240 --> 01:17:12.240\nYeah.\n\n01:17:12.240 --> 01:17:15.240\nAnd ant limp just made really good biscuits.\n\n01:17:15.240 --> 01:17:16.240\nNo.\n\n01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:20.240\nWait, what does limp biscuit mean?\n\n01:17:20.240 --> 01:17:22.240\nIs that a reference to something sexual?\n\n01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:23.240\nNo.\n\n01:17:23.240 --> 01:17:24.240\nWhat is limp biscuit?\n\n01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:32.240\nDo you have to put some people that jerk off on a biscuit and then one person can't jerk\n\n01:17:32.240 --> 01:17:33.240\noff on a biscuit?\n\n01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:34.240\nJesus.\n\n01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:35.240\nWhat?\n\n01:17:35.240 --> 01:17:38.740\nI don't understand how the ordinary world in that Campbellian journey is a bunch of people\n\n01:17:38.740 --> 01:17:40.240\njerking off on a biscuit.\n\n01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:41.240\nRight?\n\n01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:44.240\nAnd then you had to make up a phrase for when that fails.\n\n01:17:44.240 --> 01:17:45.240\nYeah.\n\n01:17:45.240 --> 01:17:50.240\nIt seems like if everybody successfully jerked off on a biscuit, the biscuit would become limp.\n\n01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:53.240\nBut you're saying that the guy that can't keep it up...\n\n01:17:53.240 --> 01:17:54.240\nJerk off is the winner.\n\n01:17:54.240 --> 01:17:55.240\nHe's the limpest.\n\n01:17:55.240 --> 01:17:56.240\nHe's the winner?\n\n01:17:56.240 --> 01:17:58.240\nThere are no winners.\n\n01:17:58.240 --> 01:18:00.240\nHe has to eat it.\n\n01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:02.240\nHe's got to eat the biscuit.\n\n01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:04.240\nYou don't get great in that biscuit?\n\n01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:07.240\nA little of my aunt's pearl jam.\n\n01:18:07.240 --> 01:18:11.740\nI always thought limp biscuit is the worst thing you can hear right before a dude punches\n\n01:18:11.740 --> 01:18:14.240\nyou in the mouth.\n\n01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:19.240\nThat's how you know you're about to get into a fight when a white dude is like, limp biscuit!\n\n01:18:19.240 --> 01:18:24.240\nYou're like, no!\n\n01:18:24.240 --> 01:18:25.240\nSo fucking embarrassing.\n\n01:18:25.240 --> 01:18:28.240\nI don't want to hear limp biscuit or Smash Mouth under any circumstances.\n\n01:18:28.240 --> 01:18:29.240\nRight.\n\n01:18:29.240 --> 01:18:34.240\nI'd rather have my ass beat to journey.\n\n01:18:34.240 --> 01:18:37.240\nJust a small town girl.\n\n01:18:37.240 --> 01:18:39.240\nYou can fuck me up to faithfully.\n\n01:18:39.240 --> 01:18:44.240\nYou can hold me forever to faithfully and just...\n\n01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:46.240\nWhat's faithfully?\n\n01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:49.240\nI'm forever yours.\n\n01:18:49.240 --> 01:18:50.240\nRight?\n\n01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:51.240\nKeep going.\n\n01:18:51.240 --> 01:18:53.240\nIt's also about semen.\n\n01:18:53.240 --> 01:18:54.240\nWhat band is that?\n\n01:18:54.240 --> 01:18:55.240\nJourney.\n\n01:18:55.240 --> 01:18:56.240\nWait.\n\n01:18:56.240 --> 01:18:58.240\nHow do I not know a journey song?\n\n01:18:58.240 --> 01:18:59.240\nFaithfully.\n\n01:18:59.240 --> 01:19:01.240\nThey ain't fucking from Missouri.\n\n01:19:01.240 --> 01:19:02.240\nAll I think of is...\n\n01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:03.240\nThat's not open arms.\n\n01:19:03.240 --> 01:19:06.240\nYou know what journey means.\n\n01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:14.240\nThat's what you poop on somebody's chest.\n\n01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:16.240\nIt all means...\n\n01:19:16.240 --> 01:19:17.240\nWhat have we found out tonight?\n\n01:19:17.240 --> 01:19:18.240\nAll of our favorite bands.\n\n01:19:18.240 --> 01:19:22.240\nTory Amos means come.\n\n01:19:22.240 --> 01:19:24.240\nSo are you guys...\n\n01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:30.240\nYou guys forgive my ignorance, but are you guys here because just because you're awesome\n\n01:19:30.240 --> 01:19:33.240\nor are you also maybe moving to feral audio with a podcast?\n\n01:19:33.240 --> 01:19:34.240\nYeah.\n\n01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:35.240\nAll right.\n\n01:19:35.240 --> 01:19:36.240\nYeah.\n\n01:19:36.240 --> 01:19:40.240\nYou can check out our podcast, Mouth Time.\n\n01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:44.240\nAnd if you're in town tomorrow, we have a show at the Comedy Store at 8 p.m.\n\n01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:45.240\nIt's gonna be awesome.\n\n01:19:45.240 --> 01:19:46.240\nYep.\n\n01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:48.240\nWhat's the podcast called?\n\n01:19:48.240 --> 01:19:49.240\nMouth Time.\n\n01:19:49.240 --> 01:19:50.240\nMouth Time.\n\n01:19:50.240 --> 01:19:51.240\nYeah.\n\n01:19:51.240 --> 01:19:54.240\nThat sounds more like Pearl Jam.\n\n01:19:54.240 --> 01:19:56.240\nOh, it's definitely about semen.\n\n01:19:56.240 --> 01:19:58.240\nI mean, this is undeniably.\n\n01:19:58.240 --> 01:19:59.240\nWhat isn't?\n\n01:19:59.240 --> 01:20:02.240\nWhen can we stop denying everything is, is?\n\n01:20:02.240 --> 01:20:04.240\nThe time we stop denying everything is.\n\n01:20:04.240 --> 01:20:09.240\nI gotta get my grammar right because otherwise I'll never become president.\n\n01:20:09.240 --> 01:20:15.240\nWhat is Mouth Time about?\n\n01:20:15.240 --> 01:20:17.240\nWhat's the angle on Mouth Time?\n\n01:20:17.240 --> 01:20:22.240\nIt was kind of inspired by a particular women's magazine podcast.\n\n01:20:22.240 --> 01:20:28.240\nSo it's hosted by two of the editors of Reductress in the world of Reductress.\n\n01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:31.240\nA parody of entertainment podcasts.\n\n01:20:31.240 --> 01:20:32.240\nYeah.\n\n01:20:32.240 --> 01:20:33.240\nI love it.\n\n01:20:33.240 --> 01:20:34.240\nKiller pitch.\n\n01:20:34.240 --> 01:20:35.240\nI know.\n\n01:20:35.240 --> 01:20:40.240\nAnd you guys are already, wait, but how long have

01:24:04.240\nOkay.\n\n01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:07.240\nWell, Christmas ended, so I don't have a job anymore.\n\n01:24:07.240 --> 01:24:08.240\nOh, because of the...\n\n01:24:08.240 --> 01:24:12.240\nOf course, Santa's such a tall character.\n\n01:24:12.240 --> 01:24:15.240\nI was a who at Universal Studios.\n\n01:24:15.240 --> 01:24:16.240\nOh, right.\n\n01:24:16.240 --> 01:24:17.240\nSo, for

height as me.\n\n01:24:32.240 --> 01:24:33.240\nBut you'd be 11 feet tall.\n\n01:24:33.240 --> 01:24:34.240\nYeah, exactly.\n\n01:24:34.240 --> 01:24:36.240\nBecause it becomes an FAA

horrifying, but yeah, you would be...\n\n01:24:47.240 --> 01:24:49.240\nNo one fucks with me anyway because I'm horrifying.\n\n01:24:49.240 --> 01:24:50.240\nExactly.\n\n01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:51.240\nI'm 6'9\".\n\n01:24:51.240 --> 01:24:52.240\nBut you don't...\n\n01:24:52.240 --> 01:24:53.240\nYou're not like...\n\n01:24:53.240 --> 01:24:55.240\nYou're like Stephen

as it's being filtered through a base enhancing device?\n\n01:27:28.880 --> 01:27:32.880\nI'm going to call myself out on that.\n\n01:27:32.880 --> 01:27:36.880\nDo any white people have white friends\n\n01:27:36.880 --> 01:27:41.880\nthat when they talk to any black person,\n\n01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:44.880\nthey uncontrollably affect a little slight urban...\n\n01:27:44.880 -->

is natural, right?\n\n01:28:09.880 --> 01:28:10.880\nIt's natural.\n\n01:28:10.880 --> 01:28:12.880\nIt's the way you say, I'm hearing you,\n\n01:28:12.880 --> 01:28:14.880\nI agree with you, I want to be on good terms with you.\n\n01:28:14.880 --> 01:28:16.880\nBecause if you start to hard army\n\n01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:18.880\nwhen I'm like chilling with you,\n\n01:28:18.880 -->

trying to reach out in your own...\n\n01:28:34.880 --> 01:28:36.880\nThat agreement is how we learn language,\n\n01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:38.880\nit's how we mimic each other\n\n01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:40.880\nbecause it's how we socially agree with each other.\n\n01:28:40.880 --> 01:28:43.880\nWell, here's what I try to do when I talk to African-Americans.\n\n01:28:47.880 -->

madness\n\n01:36:48.640 --> 01:36:50.640\nI wonder if it's not with a, is there\n\n01:36:50.640 --> 01:36:54.640\nWell, we, we, we, we have to be\n\n01:36:54.640 --> 01:36:56.640\nImprovised DnD and, we have to, oh wait,\n\n01:36:56.640 --> 01:36:58.640\nLet's do that! Okay, let's, let's figure out,\n\n01:36:58.640 --> 01:37:00.640\nOkay, we gotta, we gotta, we gotta\n\n01:37:00.640 --> 01:37:02.640\nStart doing role-playing, lets, let's make\n\n01:37:02.640 --> 01:37:03.640\nThis official business, like we're, we're\n\n01:37:03.640 --> 01:37:05.640\nGonna figure out, like, could we, should we\n\n01:37:05.640 --> 01:37:08.640\nDo, should we do a shadow run again\n\n01:37:08.640 --> 01:37:09.640\nOr should we find a new thing that's\n\n01:37:09.640 --> 01:37:11.640\nTechnically not, a, whatever you guys\n\n01:37:11.640 --> 01:37:13.640\nWant, man. Whatever will keep you playing.\n\n01:37:13.640 --> 01:37:15.640\nCuz Dan and I were talking about doing\n\n01:37:15.640 --> 01:37:17.640\nLike, our role-playing games got kind\n\n01:37:17.640 --> 01:37:19.640\nOf diffused because we would play it\n\n01:37:19.640 --> 01:37:22.800\nseven characters and sometimes none of them were here and we would never\n\n01:37:22.800 --> 01:37:26.400\nremember what the hell was going on so we're talking about going back to kind\n\n01:37:26.400 --> 01:37:32.560\nof the old days of like Sharpie and Quark and Spencer where it's maybe not\n\n01:37:32.560 --> 01:37:36.560\nend the show like do like a mid-show segment where the three of us play a\n\n01:37:36.560 --> 01:37:41.080\nlittle RPG. We're so drunk that we have no idea what's going on. Exactly but we\n\n01:37:41.080 --> 01:37:45.480\nhave a little legal maybe trouble with because of Harmon Quest. The way to be\n\n01:37:45.480 --> 01:37:51.080\nthe safest of anything if it's just if it's not. Oh that's an excellent point\n\n01:37:51.080 --> 01:37:59.200\nactually. What? Electric Boogaloo? Yeah yeah. One of the break dancers from Beat\n\n01:37:59.200 --> 01:38:06.480\nStreet? Oh yeah he's being sarcastic. It's yeah weird weird to yell that out but\n\n01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:10.520\nalso don't want to say weird because weird could have positive connotations\n\n01:38:10.520 --> 01:38:21.880\nlike dumb dumb to yell that out. It's gonna be a dick about it. I mean that\n\n01:38:21.880 --> 01:38:33.360\ncadence says only one thing. Boxed wine. Yeah. Somebody please take her box of\n\n01:38:33.360 --> 01:38:40.480\nwine away from her. I am here to vote. Say dumb to yell that out but\n\n01:38:40.480 --> 01:38:47.120\nweird to defend it which is which is a positive thing. I defend her defending it.\n\n01:38:47.120 --> 01:38:50.720\nI think the person that yelled it out was dumb. Electric Boogaloo? She's kind of\n\n01:38:50.720 --> 01:38:56.880\nJoan of Arc for going like fuck it he deserves to live. I'm like yeah she's\n\n01:38:56.880 --> 01:39:00.960\nright. I don't think they just sit next to each other. I hope Electric Boogaloo in\n\n01:39:00.960 --> 01:39:06.560\none box lady get the fucking get it on the night. But I hope that she keeps\n\n01:39:06.560 --> 01:39:13.800\ntalking to him that way. You don't have to be. You can take me home with you. We\n\n01:39:13.800 --> 01:39:19.400\nshould get each other's number. And he comes home every night from a day of\n\n01:39:19.400 --> 01:39:24.000\nfrustration he's like I just keep yelling out Electric Boogaloo and no one\n\n01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:29.840\ngets me. And she's like you don't have to be. He deserves to yell it out. And he's\n\n01:39:29.840 --> 01:39:37.680\nlike I love you. And she's like let's get something beyond bath salts. I don't\n\n01:39:37.680 --> 01:39:44.160\nwant to just eat the face. I want to eat the soul. Let's bring Florida to\n\n01:39:44.160 --> 01:39:52.200\nLos Angeles. That's why we moved here. You're the one that said shimmy dick.\n\n01:39:52.200 --> 01:39:59.600\nDon't even try it. My heart is dead.\n\n01:40:01.360 --> 01:40:06.360\nMotherfucker pays my rent.

Get on board.\n\n01:40:32.120 --> 01:40:42.640\nLove. Exciting. Motherfucker got gutsy but it black fired. I'm like the Brad Pitt\n\n01:40:42.640 --> 01:40:46.760\nright like in that metaphor like I like I come with my beard and I'm like\n\n01:40:46.760 --> 01:40:50.560\nhelping you build shit and I'm like I don't get it. Tell me explain slavery to\n\n01:40:50.560 --> 01:40:55.560\nme. I don't get it. I don't get it. We're gonna get you out of here. You would\n\n01:40:55.560 --> 01:41:02.320\ncertainly be the slave owner. It's not true. Although I do feel like my mom. I\n\n01:41:02.320 --> 01:41:10.520\nremember my mom. You have two assistants. When we were well just because I take to\n\n01:41:10.520 --> 01:41:18.440\nownership well doesn't mean that I'm like that's that's different. But I do\n\n01:41:18.440 --> 01:41:21.200\nfeel like there was a constant thing when I was growing up in Milwaukee where\n\n01:41:21.200 --> 01:41:25.920\nthere was there were people that would call our house like cold calling to\n\n01:41:25.920 --> 01:41:29.840\nround up family reunions and there would always be this awkward moment where the\n\n01:41:29.840 --> 01:41:33.840\nperson calling would be like yes the Harmon family is getting together in the\n\n01:41:33.840 --> 01:41:38.400\npark and my mom would be like okay well where should we go? And he'd be like well\n\n01:41:38.400 --> 01:41:43.240\nwe're meeting by the water fountain. Forgive me for asking but are you white?\n\n01:41:43.240 --> 01:41:49.880\nAnd my mom would go yes we are. And he'd go well we're we aren't. And then my mom\n\n01:41:49.880 --> 01:41:55.680\nwould get off the phone and go I think someone in our family owned slaves. Not\n\n01:41:55.680 --> 01:42:02.760\nwe should go to that nice black family's party. They did that convert that phone\n\n01:42:02.760 --> 01:42:06.840\ncalled disinvited us. The guy was like very he would be like you're not\n\n01:42:06.840 --> 01:42:14.040\ninvited. That is not fucking true. No you black people you you're exclusionary.\n\n01:42:14.040 --> 01:42:23.080\nMy fucking last name is Johnson. We party with everybody. Good God. The black\n\n01:42:23.080 --> 01:42:27.720\nSwedes. If somebody fucking says Johnson I shows up for the free food I'm not\n\n01:42:27.720 --> 01:42:32.160\nstupid. You should have fucking shown up. These motherfuckers would be like we're\n\n01:42:32.160 --> 01:42:34.920\nthe richest hormones and we have the greatest restaurants but that white\n\n01:42:34.920 --> 01:42:40.840\nfamily won't show up to our barbecue. Well we should have gone. I didn't have a\n\n01:42:40.840 --> 01:42:47.880\nsay in that family. I would have gone. I should have. I should have. You said you\n\n01:42:47.880 --> 01:42:51.160\nmade monologues that made change. You could have stood up. I should have made\n\n01:42:51.160 --> 01:42:56.040\none of my monologues. Let's go party with black people. I didn't do it. Well\n\n01:42:56.040 --> 01:43:09.960\nit's not too late. Bring out Reginald Harmon.

I didn't hear it but I didn't I didn't\n\n01:45:26.640 --> 01:45:37.380\nhear it. You don't have to be a dick about it. Alright well so what kind of\n\n01:45:37.380 --> 01:45:41.760\nweird muppet show is happening in the back row right now. It could be like it\n\n01:45:41.760 --> 01:45:49.320\ncould be the French. I don't even understand the inside jokes of the\n\n01:45:49.320 --> 01:45:56.800\npeople that are mocking. He was doing a Boxed Wine. That's Boxed Wine, Franzi.\n\n01:45:56.800 --> 01:46:02.320\nOur show brought to you by Franzi. That's where we loosen the\n\n01:46:02.320 --> 01:46:07.200\nreins enough for the Hoy Ploy to ooze in and teach us that there's a reason why\n\n01:46:07.200 --> 01:46:13.880\nsome of us are elitist. Now we bring it back around. So lucky that\n\n01:46:13.880 --> 01:46:17.960\nyou guys do your show in the confines of a studio where you guys you don't have\n\n01:46:17.960 --> 01:46:26.160\nto deal with everything. Oh yeah we hate people. Have you guys ever done when you\n\n01:46:26.160 --> 01:46:30.440\ndo when you do your live show do you ever how loose are the how loose is the\n\n01:46:30.440 --> 01:46:35.840\ngrip on people like chiming in and do you guys like you know what are your\n\n01:46:35.840 --> 01:46:40.160\nfeelings there what's your philosophy. People haven't chimed in at all actually\n\n01:46:40.160 --> 01:46:45.560\nI don't know I mean like our hosts are nuts so they kind of just like occupy\n\n01:46:45.560 --> 01:46:50.000\nthe space and there really isn't a lot of room for people to get in there. We create\n\n01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:56.840\nour own crazy. Yeah yeah it's our own particular brand. We just verified from\n\n01:46:56.840 --> 01:47:02.880\none of our producers Kevin the woman that I jokingly said I did not know this I\n\n01:47:02.880 --> 01:47:07.720\nsaid she was drinking Boxed Wine apparently not only is that true she's\n\n01:47:07.720 --> 01:47:15.160\ntaking the bag out of the box and just drinking it out of the mylar bag like a fucking\n\n01:47:15.160 --> 01:47:24.000\nshe's doing it right. Like Daniel Boone like a bag. She's playing Danny Boy. I didn't know I was\n\n01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:27.200\nright about Boxed Wine. I thought I was just I thought I was just being an asshole and\n\n01:47:27.200 --> 01:47:32.640\nturns out I was morally safer. All right how do we how do we end the show how\n\n01:47:32.640 --> 01:47:36.840\ndo we end a show how does anyone ever end a show I've never learned. How about one\n\n01:47:36.840 --> 01:47:41.760\nof your Andy Rooney moments where you just break it down. Kind of give me a\n\n01:47:41.760 --> 01:47:49.760\nthing that I should decry. Boxed wine. Why is why is wine always coming in boxes. No\n\n01:47:49.760 --> 01:48:00.640\none knows who Andy Rooney is. Thank you thank you thank you son thank you.

I'm never gonna forgive you for sports. I was that what\n\n01:48:27.120 --> 01:48:31.440\nreally he went he was a sportscaster for a little while. Yes so what like nerds\n\n01:48:31.440 --> 01:48:35.680\ndon't appreciate that shit but he defected he defected that's why I that's\n\n01:48:35.680 --> 01:48:40.800\npart of why I that's not cool because I because I looked at his Wikipedia I was\n\n01:48:40.800 --> 01:48:44.720\nexpecting to see like oh he you know I don't know something that was like dirt\n\n01:48:44.720 --> 01:48:48.600\nthat dirtied him just enough that he's like just sitting alone going like didn't\n\n01:48:48.600 --> 01:48:52.360\nhe get fired from MSNBC. Yeah he got fired for some thing I forget what it was. But the\n\n01:48:52.360 --> 01:48:56.320\nreason he got fired or he got suspended because he donated while he was working\n\n01:48:56.320 --> 01:49:00.840\non his thing he donated two thousand four hundred dollars to each of three\n\n01:49:00.840 --> 01:49:06.080\nDemocratic parties and then it was a technical infraction so he took a\n\n01:49:06.080 --> 01:49:09.920\nsuspension and then after the suspension they just didn't\n\n01:49:09.920 --> 01:49:13.400\nnegotiate his contract and nobody really knows this is all of Wikipedia that I\n\n01:49:13.400 --> 01:49:16.640\nwent there to going like I fully expected to hear that he like hit a kid\n\n01:49:16.640 --> 01:49:22.520\nwith his car okay so he's his major failure is that he's not an intelligent\n\n01:49:22.520 --> 01:49:28.520\nlesbian I think that's really what he's lacking. What do you mean by that?\n\n01:49:28.520 --> 01:49:34.520\nHe's lost a Rachel Maddow. There can only be one. Right.\n\n01:49:34.520 --> 01:49:38.520\nAnd Rachel Maddow is doing it. Her brand is strong.\n\n01:49:38.520 --> 01:49:43.920\nShe just does like awesome stand-up like her whole show she looks at the\n\n01:49:43.920 --> 01:49:48.840\ncamera and just does like like extended stand-up bits. I adore her I have room\n\n01:49:48.840 --> 01:49:53.280\nin my life for both of them I'm not bragging when I say that I just didn't\n\n01:49:53.280 --> 01:49:57.080\nsee them as yeah well I have to watch one or the other like I and he looks like\n\n01:49:57.080 --> 01:50:01.680\nSam the Eagle so as I would think that I would think that he would have like a\n\n01:50:01.680 -->
