{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:25.000\nHere we are, immersed in what can only be called an extinct bank vault, so this is fantastic.\n\n00:25.000 --> 00:34.000\nIt looks like a prison in a bank. Harmontown is now in Session Road Island.\n\n00:34.000 --> 00:53.000\nWould you please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.\n\n00:53.000 --> 01:04.000\nRoad Island! Did you want more music? No, no, no. That was the end of the song. Road Island.\n\n01:04.000 --> 01:14.000\nSome facts about Rhode Island, Jeff. Well, you just told me you didn't Wikipedia them. The typewriter was invented here? That's not true.\n\n01:14.000 --> 01:42.000\nIt is the smallest state per capita. It is only 175 yards across. It is between the lower curve of the Tangiers River and the Colorado Peninsula.\n\n01:42.000 --> 01:53.000\nIt is the most haunted state. Are there any famous ghosts? There are several famous ghosts.\n\n01:53.000 --> 02:08.000\nKing Tut. Haunt is rumored to haunt the Biltmore, which is just down the street. Charles Dickens apparently roams the old First Street promenade.\n\n02:08.000 --> 02:27.000\nStill warning children about the events of Halloween 1912. And also Connecticut haunts Rhode Island. Why is that? Just jealousy.\n\n02:27.000 --> 02:38.000\nEver since Rhode Island was invented, Connecticut became yesterday's news. It suffered a sort of public relations death. It felt unjustified.\n\n02:38.000 --> 02:47.000\nIf you still listen very quietly, you can still hear Connecticut weeping in the winds of the Rhode Island expressway.\n\n02:47.000 --> 02:58.000\nAll right, I didn't do any research. I figured it was a small state we could get away with one night of just hanging out. A lot of you probably came here because we begged you to at the Boston show.\n\n02:58.000 --> 03:11.000\nAnd still others of you who weren't begged probably came in. What, Rhode Island's like 30 feet across? What are the odds that anyone's actually from within the boundaries of the state? Who do we have here that's actually a Rhode Islander?\n\n03:11.000 --> 03:25.000\nClap. Don't raise your hands. Well, yeah, actually a shit ton of people. The entire population of Rhode Island. How big is Rhode Island? What's the actual...\n\n03:25.000 --> 03:47.000\n35 by 40 miles. 35 by 40 miles? I would have no idea if that was a joke or not. You could tell me 350 miles. I don't have any sense of the scale. I know that when you look at it on the Internet, it's one of the few states in the U.S. where they have to have that little magnifying glass thing come up.\n\n03:47.000 --> 04:01.000\nThey can't just put the red dot on it that it has to have a little inset where they're like, it's over here. I mean, I think that's nothing to be ashamed of. I don't know what having a big state gets you. I think that's stupid.\n\n04:01.000 --> 04:17.000\nIt kind of defeats the purpose of being a state. Like, how are you supposed to make all those people happy? What kind of laws are you going to pass? Pass out law on Rhode Island, you know that it's like firmly set because it's like only a couple people like said this. No, no smoking.\n\n04:17.000 --> 04:23.000\nFor real. Me, Carl and Dave said so.\n\n04:23.000 --> 04:33.000\nNow, there's a reason, Dan, that I didn't Wikipedia Rhode Island today because he was very busy. Oh, yeah, I turned in my CBS script for today.\n\n04:33.000 --> 04:49.000\nI've been kind of, you've probably sensed in the previous two or episodes that I've been a little preoccupied. I wasn't really letting my hair down that much. It was because I had something, I had that on my mind.\n\n04:49.000 --> 04:54.000\nAnd now I'm done. Now I'm free clear.\n\n04:54.000 --> 04:57.000\nYou've got like 48 hours to write a whole other script, don't you?\n\n04:57.000 --> 05:06.000\nYeah, yeah, for Fox, yeah. But that's going to be the next community. That's not going to be a problem. That's fine. That's going to come easy.\n\n05:06.000 --> 05:20.000\nThe CBS thing was like rolling a brick up a hill because it's like, Jesus Christ, why is everything double spaced? That's how they like it. They like it double spaced. They like more cameras and more pages over there.\n\n05:20.000 --> 05:27.000\nIt's not easy. And you have to write in, did you know this when you write a multi-camera script, you have to write in where the people laugh?\n\n05:27.000 --> 05:38.000\nDid you know that? No, you don't. No, I'm kidding. That would be amazing. People laugh and then people chuckle and people go, ooh.\n\n05:38.000 --> 05:48.000\nCan we do a reading of the script tonight?\n\n05:48.000 --> 05:57.000\nI don't know. I don't think we're allowed to. That's ridiculous. They paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for it. I can't read it.\n\n05:57.000 --> 06:01.000\n$10 worth? Yeah. Give us like one couplet.\n\n06:01.000 --> 06:09.000\nI did some tasty fade-ins. That's $10 worth of...\n\n06:09.000 --> 06:22.000\nI used the letter Q quite a bit, ways you might not expect. I'm legally liable now. The letter Q is used eight times in the script. You know too much.\n\n06:22.000 --> 06:30.000\nIt's about a guy and his daughter. You can't really get deeper than that in a multi-camera sitcom. It's about a guy and his daughter. It's about relationships, Jeff.\n\n06:30.000 --> 06:40.000\nMulti-camera sitcoms are not a baser art form. In fact, they are in television terms more classic, obviously. We started with the honeymooners when we started making sitcoms.\n\n06:40.000 --> 06:48.000\nWe started with the idea that these were plays that were adapted for larger audiences, but at their heart were a couple hundred people watching something reacting together as human beings.\n\n06:48.000 --> 07:00.000\nThey may seem to our new cinematic savvy eyes as being somehow more primitive or cheesy or watered down or silly, but I think that's just because a lot of them are written very poorly.\n\n07:00.000 --> 07:09.000\nI think that I turned in one that's superior to everything on television. I think I'm going to revitalize the whole format. I think people are going to be going,\n\n07:09.000 --> 07:21.000\nWhy? Why? Why? Why? Why doesn't everyone laugh at everything all the time when you're watching it? It's going to bury the voice and American Idol and Major League Baseball.\n\n07:21.000 --> 07:30.000\nEveryone's going to start watching shows about guys in an apartment that can't make the rent and have a dog forever.\n\n07:30.000 --> 07:40.000\nI think this is a nice-looking place. Dave and Corey, that's their names, right? The guys that run the place? Dave and Corey? Am I getting that right?\n\n07:40.000 --> 07:53.000\nDave and Corey are too modest to call out, yes. They were interior design guys before they opened this club. That's not a joke.\n\n07:53.000 --> 08:04.000\nThey told me, and their Wi-Fi password is DaveCore2630. Why would you tell them that?\n\n08:04.000 --> 08:06.000\nWell, because if anyone wants to get on the Wi-Fi...\n\n08:06.000 --> 08:12.000\nOh, I see, okay. Just fragment this audience to pieces. We can probably check on our Facebooks.\n\n08:12.000 --> 08:24.000\nAnd I said, are you guys 26 and 30 years old? Because I know my passwords often have my ages attached to them. When the thing says you have to have a number, I just stick my age on there.\n\n08:24.000 --> 08:36.000\nSo over the year, I'm like, God damn it. Was I 37 or 38 when I started getting into feet? When I went through my latex phase.\n\n08:36.000 --> 08:42.000\nHow many porn passwords did you think you have? It's impossible, Jeff. An impossible calculation.\n\n08:42.000 --> 08:51.000\nFortunately, I lose my credit cards enough that they expire by virtue of... I just get a lot of emails going, we tried to bill your credit card, yeah, fuck you.\n\n08:51.000 --> 08:57.000\nThat's what you get for your sneaky ways of capitalizing on people in a moment of weakness.\n\n08:57.000 --> 09:09.000\nI'm not only a porn addict, I'm also a drunk, so I lost my wallet again. So I jerked off only as much as I needed to.\n\n09:09.000 --> 09:20.000\nBut no, Dave and Corey are not 26 and 30, but that's how old they were when they started their first business.\n\n09:20.000 --> 09:33.000\nI thought that was cool. I don't know. It's funny the way that we have public things like Wi-Fi names and license plates and things that...\n\n09:33.000 --> 09:39.000\nYou can open a little hobbit door and go into all of a sudden you're finding out things about people.\n\n09:39.000 --> 09:45.000\nFor example, Jeff... I don't have an example. I don't know what's so cool.\n\n09:45.000 --> 09:50.000\nI've known you for a long time. You've gone through a series of fetishes or maybe...\n\n09:50.000 --> 09:52.000\nLet's talk about that.\n\n09:52.000 --> 09:56.000\nIt's Rhode Island. Where's this going to go?\n\n09:56.000 --> 10:03.000\nAre you on something new that I don't know about? Have you gone down a new rabbit hole into finding out questions?\n\n10:03.000 --> 10:07.000\nWhat have I been into tracing my... I wish I could trace history.\n\n10:07.000 --> 10:21.000\nFor those of you who've listened before, I was at Dan's apartment years and years ago and he had taken all these individual pages out of titty mags and playboys and stuff and put them in a manila folder.\n\n10:21.000 --> 10:26.000\nRather than having all the magazines around, he just took out the pages that were potent.\n\n10:26.000 --> 10:34.000\nRight. Anybody ever do that? That's probably a thing. Oh, God. Is it Marissa? Is your mom here again?\n\n10:34.000 --> 10:42.000\nYeah, we brought this girl's mom on stage last night and we talked about masturbation and it was touching go.\n\n10:42.000 --> 10:50.000\nOh, I'm good by accidents. That was accidental gold.\n\n10:50.000 --> 11:05.000\nAnybody over... I would estimate 30. Any guy over 30 might know about that process where maybe you'd have to be over 35. The consolidation phase when you're like...\n\n11:05.000 --> 11:16.000\nI've never met a guy who didn't have this problem. You tend to hoard pornography. You can't throw it away.\n\n11:16.000 --> 11:24.000\nWe get bored with it. You look at a picture of a certain person. See how inclusive I was there?\n\n11:24.000 --> 11:31.000\nYou can be like, holy shit, this is amazing. This is right up my alley. Okay, great.\n\n11:31.000 --> 11:40.000\nBut it's like any MP3 or anything, or a piece of chewing gum or anything, it's just a picture. It's not Erin McGathy at the end of the day.\n\n11:40.000 --> 11:50.000\nNice save. Nice save. It's not someone you can love who brings you steak salads when you're working on your pilot and who serves you tea when you have the sniffles.\n\n11:50.000 --> 11:57.000\nAnd he cuddles up with you in the morning and he looks like a little baby strawberry cuddled up under your comforter.\n\n11:57.000 --> 12:00.000\nShe just gave you the business backstage about sneaking a nacho though.\n\n12:00.000 --> 12:09.000\nYeah, well, she cares about me. She wants me to live long enough and I'm 12 years older than her. Sometimes she'll sit me down and go, Dan, you're going to die.\n\n12:09.000 --> 12:16.000\nYou got to eat good. Is she the specter of death?\n\n12:16.000 --> 12:24.000\nShe puts her hand on my face and spreads her fingers in a weird way and says, you're going to die. You're going to die. She cares about me.\n\n12:24.000 --> 12:40.000\nBut even though the pornography loses its flavor, guys, I'm not going to say back me up on this. But if anyone who is the exception to this rule, I'd love to talk to you.\n\n12:40.000 --> 12:55.000\nI can't throw it away. And now we've gone into this age where it's on your hard drive instead of under your bed in a box or something, but back before the Internet made all periodical pornography obsolete,\n\n12:55.000 --> 13:06.000\nthere were these magazines and if you were like me and you were in your 20s and you were like, okay, I'm going to get another one because everything loses its flavor, but you can't throw the old ones away.\n\n13:06.000 --> 13:11.000\nWhat I'm describing is you found my manila folder full of consolidated porn.\n\n13:11.000 --> 13:13.000\nThe greatest hits.\n\n13:13.000 --> 13:23.000\nJust out of sheer bulk, I got to clear the decks here, but I'm going to take the pages out that are most important and I'll put them all in a manila folder that was about this thick.\n\n13:23.000 --> 13:30.000\nAnd Jeff was going through them. Oh, I'm sorry, this thick. I've held up my hands about two inches. Two inches thick.\n\n13:30.000 --> 13:37.000\nJeff found it and was going through it. It was like, what is this? That's my porn consolidation file.\n\n13:37.000 --> 13:43.000\nWhen I moved from such and such to such and such, I consolidated to save U-Haul space.\n\n13:43.000 --> 13:49.000\nAnd he's looking through it and he goes, geez, you got a thing for redheads, huh?\n\n13:49.000 --> 13:53.000\nAnd I was like, I do? And then I looked through and they were all redheads.\n\n13:53.000 --> 14:03.000\nNot an exciting story, but very interesting that I didn't see that. But then you started going down a road of mannequin legs, nylons on mannequin legs,\n\n14:03.000 --> 14:08.000\nvideos about women under the table popping their shoe off their heel.\n\n14:08.000 --> 14:16.000\nThen you bought the real doll. We didn't see you for a year until you fucked her head off or something. What happened?\n\n14:16.000 --> 14:18.000\nThe head started to kind of tear at the neck.\n\n14:18.000 --> 14:31.000\nThat sounds violent. Anybody that works in television special effects will tell you that latex and silicon and stuff, that stuff degrades.\n\n14:31.000 --> 14:37.000\nAnd then you see these ads for, oh, buy a fake woman made out of this stuff and you're like, ah, it's the perfect crime.\n\n14:37.000 --> 14:43.000\nI'll take myself off the market. I'll spare all these poor women. I'll spare myself. Everyone will win.\n\n14:43.000 --> 14:51.000\nBut then six months later, it's like the heads falling off. It's awful. It's awful. It's really grody.\n\n14:51.000 --> 14:52.000\nSo where are you at now?\n\n14:52.000 --> 14:54.000\nBecause when do you throw that thing away?\n\n14:54.000 --> 15:02.000\nIf you keep a magazine, when do you throw away your $6,000 rubber woman?\n\n15:02.000 --> 15:05.000\nYou just roll her up in a rug and throw her off the 101 freeway.\n\n15:05.000 --> 15:10.000\nAwful. Thank God I had an assistant by that time.\n\n15:10.000 --> 15:15.000\nYou made someone do it for you?\n\n15:15.000 --> 15:16.000\nYeah, yeah.\n\n15:16.000 --> 15:18.000\nHow did she or he dispose of it?\n\n15:18.000 --> 15:29.000\nAsk her. I went on a road trip. That crate better be gone when I get back. It's depressing.\n\n15:29.000 --> 15:33.000\nIt came in a crate that's like a Stephen King thing.\n\n15:33.000 --> 15:42.000\nThink of the alternatives. Is it supposed to come in a spider web? Is it supposed to come in a cocoon? Like a gremlin?\n\n15:42.000 --> 15:46.000\nSo where are you at now? What's floating in your boat now?\n\n15:46.000 --> 15:52.000\nI don't know. I don't know.\n\n15:52.000 --> 15:55.000\nYou don't know that you can tell us or you don't know what it is?\n\n15:55.000 --> 16:05.000\nWell, I'm in a relationship now. Number one, it's not so much about exploration. When you get the chance or have the urge, it's more of a shotgun thing.\n\n16:05.000 --> 16:07.000\nYou're just like, all right, I'll tell you whatever.\n\n16:07.000 --> 16:15.000\nAlso, because I'm in a relationship, it's really not the time to get that specific, like, contrary.\n\n16:15.000 --> 16:21.000\nI don't know. It feels like the past is more, you're more allowed to be honest about the past.\n\n16:21.000 --> 16:24.000\nLet's talk about yesterday.\n\n16:24.000 --> 16:28.000\nGreen-haired, middle-aged women I was into.\n\n16:28.000 --> 16:32.000\nOh, I thought you meant like...\n\n16:32.000 --> 16:35.000\nErin flyered for the show today.\n\n16:35.000 --> 16:46.000\nShe's so dedicated to my happiness that she printed up a thousand flyers for the show and just took them around to hand out to people.\n\n16:46.000 --> 16:56.000\nIs anyone here because of the flyer?\n\n16:56.000 --> 16:58.000\nWay to go.\n\n16:58.000 --> 17:03.000\nThat doesn't mean the flyering was ineffective. It only means that she forgot to put the showtime on them.\n\n17:03.000 --> 17:12.000\nIt was a very hasty, love-motivated job. It was less about engineering and more about an expression of wanting me to be happy.\n\n17:12.000 --> 17:18.000\nI was told that the first flyer she handed to somebody, a girl goes, oh, that's great. What time is the show?\n\n17:18.000 --> 17:25.000\nAnd I was like, oh, fuck.\n\n17:25.000 --> 17:29.000\nWhat time is the show? That's what's weird. The answer is 5.30.\n\n17:29.000 --> 17:34.000\nFor those of you in podcast land, the sun is still streaming in through the Rhode Island skylights.\n\n17:34.000 --> 17:39.000\nThere's a cat lazily napping on the warm sidewalk.\n\n17:39.000 --> 17:47.000\nThere's eggs on the griddle, and we're doing a little comedy, a little conversative comedy before Bobcat Goldway comes on at 6 p.m.\n\n17:47.000 --> 17:49.000\n7.30, I think.\n\n17:49.000 --> 17:58.000\nThis is the second time that we have found ourselves inadvertently opening for Bobcat, and I'm going to do some checking after the show.\n\n17:58.000 --> 18:02.000\nActually, I'm going to do some checking with Bob, who we know and love.\n\n18:02.000 --> 18:11.000\nWe don't know from Bob if the same woman at our agency is doing the booking of his shows, because if she's the one...\n\n18:11.000 --> 18:21.000\nIf the reason why every time we're in the same town as Bobcat is because she's double booking rooms, I'm going to kick her in the fucking forehead.\n\n18:21.000 --> 18:29.000\nBecause I don't know how funny you guys feel at 5.30, but you should just be thankful that I'm an alcoholic,\n\n18:29.000 --> 18:33.000\nbecause no one should be this drunk at this time.\n\n18:33.000 --> 18:39.000\nBackstage, you're feeling pretty cocky about yourself worth, and you're talking about your powers as a writer.\n\n18:39.000 --> 18:41.000\nYou're hulking out back there.\n\n18:41.000 --> 18:44.000\nYeah, what's different? What do you mean?\n\n18:44.000 --> 18:47.000\nI have a sociopathic edge to me right now, don't I?\n\n18:47.000 --> 18:52.000\nCan't you hear the kind of weird, cold, even temper to my voice?\n\n18:52.000 --> 18:58.000\nDon't I seem like a little soulless and kind of into myself?\n\n18:58.000 --> 19:00.000\nI'm an apologetic.\n\n19:00.000 --> 19:29.000\nLet's just, as a barometer, I just want to do a little experiment just to see how different you are tonight from other nights.\n\n19:30.000 --> 19:32.000\nI fucked your mama on the corner of her nose.\n\n19:32.000 --> 19:37.000\nI fucked your mama and a tree grows out of her face where I fucked her.\n\n19:37.000 --> 19:41.000\nThat's how fertile my semen is.\n\n19:41.000 --> 19:43.000\nIt's pretty good, it's pretty good.\n\n19:43.000 --> 19:48.000\nI think you're about there.\n\n19:48.000 --> 19:50.000\nI don't know.\n\n19:50.000 --> 19:52.000\nYou know my mama's dead, right?\n\n19:52.000 --> 19:55.000\nYeah, yeah, yeah. So's Erin, so's everybody's.\n\n19:55.000 --> 19:56.000\nBig, big whoop-de-doo.\n\n19:56.000 --> 19:58.000\nMaybe it's because you keep all your dead moms.\n\n19:58.000 --> 20:04.000\nMaybe it's because you keep fucking people and trees grow out of their face.\n\n20:04.000 --> 20:06.000\nAll I do is express myself.\n\n20:06.000 --> 20:09.000\nMaybe I wish I had a dead mom.\n\n20:09.000 --> 20:14.000\nThat's another way of saying it.\n\n20:14.000 --> 20:18.000\nMom, if you're listening, that doesn't mean I wish you were dead.\n\n20:18.000 --> 20:20.000\nIt just means I wish I had a dead mom.\n\n20:20.000 --> 20:26.000\nIt's two different things.\n\n20:26.000 --> 20:29.000\nI mean, it's like...\n\n20:29.000 --> 20:31.000\nWould you for rap purposes?\n\n20:31.000 --> 20:33.000\nBecause obviously you don't literally mean you're going to fuck my mother.\n\n20:33.000 --> 20:34.000\nAre these people's mothers?\n\n20:34.000 --> 20:37.000\nWould you ever rap about fucking your own mother?\n\n20:37.000 --> 20:39.000\nYeah, sure, I would.\n\n20:39.000 --> 20:51.000\nI fucked my own mom. It was amazing.\n\n20:51.000 --> 20:53.000\nSkies were hazing.\n\n20:53.000 --> 20:55.000\nIt was judgment day.\n\n20:55.000 --> 20:57.000\nI fucked my own mom in an intimate way.\n\n20:57.000 --> 21:00.000\nI curled up with her in a hamlet bed.\n\n21:00.000 --> 21:02.000\nI said, oh baby, gonna kiss your head.\n\n21:02.000 --> 21:04.000\nI would go down to your collar bone.\n\n21:04.000 --> 21:07.000\nI'm gonna fuck you like I was alone.\n\n21:07.000 --> 21:09.000\nI'm gonna jerk off on your tinny and your knee.\n\n21:09.000 --> 21:11.000\nI'm gonna fuck you like I only fuck me.\n\n21:11.000 --> 21:14.000\nI'm gonna roll you over and fuck you from behind.\n\n21:14.000 --> 21:16.000\nI'm gonna fuck you pussy and see what I find.\n\n21:16.000 --> 21:19.000\nIt's a wedding ring.

That's good.\n\n21:30.000 --> 21:42.000\nDid you see, I don't know if you saw, between where I said, I forgot Oedipus's name.\n\n21:42.000 --> 21:44.000\nOh, is that what you started scramming with?\n\n21:44.000 --> 21:47.000\nYeah, I fucked it. I was like Orpheus? What is it?\n\n21:47.000 --> 21:48.000\nRight.\n\n21:48.000 --> 21:52.000\nThat's a senior moment. I lost the word Oedipus.\n\n21:52.000 --> 21:55.000\nYou don't get more primal than the word Oedipus.\n\n21:55.000 --> 22:00.000\nIf you're talking about fucking your mom and you forget the word Oedipus,\n\n22:00.000 --> 22:07.000\nyou get a couple of scripts left in you before you need to...\n\n22:07.000 --> 22:11.000\nHunter the old Thompson.\n\n22:11.000 --> 22:15.000\nFoster the Wallace.\n\n22:15.000 --> 22:18.000\nSpalding your grave.\n\n22:18.000 --> 22:20.000\nHemming your way.\n\n22:20.000 --> 22:22.000\nYeah, what?

What are you...\n\n22:33.000 --> 22:37.000\nThis next one better be a florist that lived forever.\n\n22:37.000 --> 22:39.000\nThat's another great of a killer.\n\n22:39.000 --> 22:42.000\nHow am I going to fucking freak out?\n\n22:42.000 --> 22:44.000\nSpalding grace from Rhode Island.\n\n22:44.000 --> 22:46.000\nSpalding grace from Rhode Island.\n\n22:46.000 --> 22:49.000\nOh, nice. I knew that. Full circle. Thank you, sir.\n\n22:49.000 --> 22:53.000\nReally, originally, he was born in Rhode Island. Did he live here?\n\n22:53.000 --> 22:56.000\nI was so bummed out when he killed himself.\n\n22:56.000 --> 22:59.000\nI mean, I get bummed out anytime anyone kills themselves,\n\n22:59.000 --> 23:02.000\nbut I don't know about most of the people.\n\n23:02.000 --> 23:04.000\nAnd I really, really respect it, Spalding Gray,\n\n23:04.000 --> 23:07.000\nand as I'm sure a lot of people here did.\n\n23:07.000 --> 23:10.000\nIt's such a fucking bummer.\n\n23:10.000 --> 23:14.000\nYeah, like these talented people.\n\n23:14.000 --> 23:19.000\nA fan in the Brooklyn show came up to me\n\n23:19.000 --> 23:22.000\nand gave me a David Foster Wallace novel\n\n23:22.000 --> 23:24.000\nthat I never knew David Foster Wallace wrote,\n\n23:24.000 --> 23:27.000\nbecause I just thought that David Foster Wallace was an essayist.\n\n23:27.000 --> 23:30.000\nI didn't really actually know that he was an amazing novelist.\n\n23:30.000 --> 23:32.000\nWas that John Lennon?\n\n23:32.000 --> 23:33.000\nHe's not a great fan.\n\n23:33.000 --> 23:34.000\nInfinite Jest or another man?\n\n23:34.000 --> 23:35.000\nYeah, Infinite Jest.\n\n23:35.000 --> 23:37.000\nThat's a big-ass book. That's like a phone book.\n\n23:37.000 --> 23:40.000\nSo I simultaneously learned that David Foster Wallace\n\n23:40.000 --> 23:43.000\nhad written a novel and that he had killed himself\n\n23:43.000 --> 23:44.000\nin, I think, 2008.\n\n23:44.000 --> 23:46.000\nI didn't know either of those facts.\n\n23:46.000 --> 23:48.000\nI bought that book the day before he died.\n\n23:48.000 --> 23:50.000\nIt was really weird.\n\n23:50.000 --> 23:53.000\nHaven't read it.\n\n23:53.000 --> 23:55.000\nThat one's especially tragic, because, I mean,\n\n23:55.000 --> 23:57.000\nI think they're all probably, I don't know,\n\n23:57.000 --> 23:59.000\nthere's probably linkage to...\n\n23:59.000 --> 24:01.000\nIt's just so clearly kind of chemical,\n\n24:01.000 --> 24:06.000\nlike he was on meds and he had to go off of them\n\n24:06.000 --> 24:08.000\nbecause they were causing him trouble,\n\n24:08.000 --> 24:10.000\nand then he started to have troubles.\n\n24:10.000 --> 24:13.000\nAnd it just sounds like...\n\n24:13.000 --> 24:15.000\nWhen people kill themselves,\n\n24:15.000 --> 24:17.000\nit's kind of by definition you think,\n\n24:17.000 --> 24:18.000\nwell, that's a voluntary act.\n\n24:18.000 --> 24:20.000\nIf someone gets hit by a subway train\n\n24:20.000 --> 24:22.000\nor hit by lightning or gets cancer,\n\n24:22.000 --> 24:25.000\nthat's by definition an involuntary act.\n\n24:25.000 --> 24:28.000\nBut when people are kind of chemically troubled\n\n24:28.000 --> 24:31.000\nand there's medication involved and then they can't...\n\n24:31.000 --> 24:35.000\nIt's weird because it's as involuntary,\n\n24:35.000 --> 24:37.000\nit seems, as getting hit by a train.\n\n24:37.000 --> 24:39.000\nLike if you caught this person on the right day\n\n24:39.000 --> 24:42.000\nat the right time and gave them the right thing\n\n24:42.000 --> 24:45.000\nin their pancake syrup or something,\n\n24:45.000 --> 24:48.000\nyou could keep them from making this decision\n\n24:48.000 --> 24:50.000\nthat was going to last forever.\n\n24:50.000 --> 24:52.000\nTerrible, awful.\n\n24:52.000 --> 24:54.000\nHey, let's do the raffle!\n\n24:54.000 --> 24:59.000\nEverybody look under your seats.\n\n24:59.000 --> 25:02.000\nBut we're giving away lithium tonight.\n\n25:02.000 --> 25:05.000\nIf you think you need it, please use it,\n\n25:05.000 --> 25:08.000\nespecially if you're an incredibly talented writer.\n\n25:08.000 --> 25:11.000\nI will never do that, I don't think.\n\n25:11.000 --> 25:13.000\nI'm not talented enough\n\n25:13.000 --> 25:16.000\nand I'm too chicken shit and too...\n\n25:16.000 --> 25:22.000\nI don't think I could never picture myself doing that.\n\n25:22.000 --> 25:24.000\nBut at the same time,\n\n25:24.000 --> 25:26.000\ndidn't Spalding Gray do it\n\n25:26.000 --> 25:28.000\nbecause he was in a lot of physical pain?\n\n25:28.000 --> 25:30.000\nWasn't he fucked up?\n\n25:30.000 --> 25:32.000\nYeah, he was in an auto accident in Ireland\n\n25:32.000 --> 25:35.000\nand he came back and he couldn't ever get over that.\n\n25:35.000 --> 25:38.000\nYeah, it was...

little movie that I saw.\n\n43:13.000 --> 43:15.000\nHe illustrated the same thing.\n\n43:15.000 --> 43:17.000\nI was actually a lone little\n\n43:17.000 --> 43:19.000\nwhite drop in a public school\n\n43:19.000 --> 43:21.000\nsee that I didn't really perceive\n\n43:21.000 --> 43:23.000\nuntil later.\n\n43:23.000 --> 43:25.000\nI have little photos of me\n\n43:25.000 --> 43:27.000\nin graduation ceremonies\n\n43:27.000 --> 43:29.000\nand it's like my head in a sea\n\n43:29.000 --> 43:31.000\nof things that I now distinguish\n\n43:31.000 --> 43:33.000\nbut that I didn't instinctively do\n\n43:33.000 --> 43:35.000\nback then.\n\n43:35.000 --> 43:37.000\nWe find it hard to believe as a racially obsessed society\n\n43:37.000 --> 43:39.000\nthat it actually is an artificial construct\n\n43:39.000 --> 43:41.000\nbut it is so much more artificial\n\n43:41.000 --> 43:43.000\nthan so many more real things\n\n43:43.000 --> 43:45.000\nthat we've actually also been hypnotized\n\n43:45.000 --> 43:47.000\nto not pay attention to\n\n43:47.000 --> 43:49.000\nthat are more real.\n\n43:49.000 --> 43:51.000\nLike poverty and wealth\n\n43:51.000 --> 43:53.000\nand how that doesn't make you a good or a bad person.\n\n43:53.000 --> 43:55.000\nWe are very convinced\n\n43:55.000 --> 43:57.000\nthat poor people are their own fault.\n\n43:57.000 --> 43:59.000\nThat when you wake up poor, you're a piece of shit,\n\n43:59.000 --> 44:01.000\nyou did something wrong.\n\n44:01.000 --> 44:03.000\nWe're also very convinced that when you get sick,\n\n44:03.000 --> 44:05.000\nyou did something wrong.\n\n44:05.000 --> 44:07.000\nWhen you're in a wheelchair, I get fucking\n\n44:07.000 --> 44:09.000\nlike I go into crisis mode\n\n44:09.000 --> 44:11.000\nlike my goal is to\n\n44:11.000 --> 44:13.000\nfigure out how to avoid\n\n44:13.000 --> 44:15.000\nthis poor person who probably\n\n44:15.000 --> 44:17.000\nwould be into talking about\n\n44:17.000 --> 44:19.000\nwhat is wrong and what happened\n\n44:19.000 --> 44:21.000\nand how hard it is and all this stuff\n\n44:21.000 --> 44:23.000\nbut all I can think about\n\n44:23.000 --> 44:25.000\nthrough after school specials\n\n44:25.000 --> 44:27.000\nand my own narcissism is like\n\n44:27.000 --> 44:29.000\nfuck that guy, he's just gotta be a living ghost\n\n44:29.000 --> 44:31.000\nor that's what's best for both of us\n\n44:31.000 --> 44:33.000\nand that's way more real\n\n44:33.000 --> 44:35.000\nin your skin\n\n44:35.000 --> 44:37.000\nbecause there's a lot of\n\n44:37.000 --> 44:39.000\nanyways, I keep sounding\n\n44:39.000 --> 44:41.000\nlike I'm running for something, it's stupid\n\n44:41.000 --> 44:43.000\nbut\n\n44:43.000 --> 44:45.000\nI'm probably\n\n44:45.000 --> 44:47.000\nflawfully fascinated\n\n44:47.000 --> 44:49.000\nwith this stuff\n\n44:49.000 --> 44:51.000\nand I\n\n44:51.000 --> 44:53.000\nwhat was our point, what were we on?\n\n44:53.000 --> 44:55.000\nI derailed that, I derailed it.\n\n44:55.000 --> 44:57.000\nWe're talking about sexism, racism,\n\n44:57.000 --> 44:59.000\nI mean sexism seems more real\n\n44:59.000 --> 45:01.000\nbecause women are\n\n45:01.000 --> 45:03.000\nchemically different from men, they literally\n\n45:03.000 --> 45:05.000\nhave no penis\n\n45:05.000 --> 45:07.000\nfrom birth\n\n45:07.000 --> 45:09.000\nthere's an actual hole where the penis\n\n45:09.000 --> 45:11.000\ngoes on a man\n\n45:11.000 --> 45:13.000\nand there's\n\n45:13.000 --> 45:15.000\nthis is true, no it's true\n\n45:17.000 --> 45:19.000\nI'm just shaking my head back here\n\n45:19.000 --> 45:21.000\nand\n\n45:21.000 --> 45:23.000\nas an extension of sexism\n\n45:23.000 --> 45:25.000\nthen homophobia is actually a little more real\n\n45:25.000 --> 45:27.000\neven though there's a huge difference\n\n45:27.000 --> 45:29.000\nbetween homophobia and racism\n\n45:29.000 --> 45:31.000\nbut a homosexual\n\n45:31.000 --> 45:33.000\ncan walk around\n\n45:33.000 --> 45:35.000\nand get a job and hang out\n\n45:35.000 --> 45:37.000\nand if they choose to\n\n45:37.000 --> 45:39.000\nthey can never have anyone\n\n45:39.000 --> 45:41.000\nor even themselves be conscious of the thing\n\n45:41.000 --> 45:43.000\nthat makes them different\n\n45:43.000 --> 45:45.000\ninside\n\n45:45.000 --> 45:47.000\nwomen can't, they can't escape\n\n45:47.000 --> 45:49.000\ntheir gender\n\n45:49.000 --> 45:51.000\nand to the extent that we keep paying attention\n\n45:51.000 --> 45:53.000\nto race, people can't escape their race\n\n45:53.000 --> 45:55.000\nwhat's my point?\n\n45:55.000 --> 45:57.000\nI don't know\n\n45:57.000 --> 45:59.000\nthere's gotta be a card game we can make out of this\n\n45:59.000 --> 46:01.000\nor\n\n46:01.000 --> 46:03.000\nwhat do we, I think\n\n46:03.000 --> 46:05.000\nis the problem solving itself?\n\n46:05.000 --> 46:07.000\nwe're getting, I noticed that\n\n46:07.000 --> 46:09.000\n20 year olds are bored with\n\n46:09.000 --> 46:11.000\nthings that used to make\n\n46:11.000 --> 46:13.000\nme laugh when I was 20\n\n46:13.000 --> 46:15.000\nrace used to be a much hotter\n\n46:15.000 --> 46:17.000\nbutton when you mashed it as a comedy\n\n46:17.000 --> 46:19.000\nwriter, I can see\n\n46:19.000 --> 46:21.000\nmyself becoming antiquated\n\n46:21.000 --> 46:23.000\nin writer's rooms, I can see\n\n46:23.000 --> 46:25.000\npeople like Donald Glover\n\n46:25.000 --> 46:27.000\ngoing like, yeah\n\n46:27.000 --> 46:29.000\nit's not that funny and it's not\n\n46:29.000 --> 46:31.000\nindignant or anything, it's just getting\n\n46:31.000 --> 46:33.000\nhackier and hackier to\n\n46:33.000 --> 46:35.000\nmash those buttons\n\n46:35.000 --> 46:37.000\nwhich I think is a good sign\n\n46:37.000 --> 46:39.000\nis everything fading\n\n46:39.000 --> 46:41.000\nis everything getting better?\n\n46:41.000 --> 46:43.000\nsure\n\n46:43.000 --> 46:45.000\nI think that things\n\n46:45.000 --> 46:47.000\nmove in cycles honestly\n\n46:47.000 --> 46:49.000\nand it's really difficult to tell\n\n46:49.000 --> 46:51.000\nespecially with the recent history\n\n46:51.000 --> 46:53.000\nof race in this country\n\n46:53.000 --> 46:55.000\nI do think that\n\n46:55.000 --> 46:57.000\nthe problem with\n\n46:57.000 --> 46:59.000\npeople ignoring it and getting\n\n46:59.000 --> 47:01.000\nbored with it is that they still haven't dealt\n\n47:01.000 --> 47:03.000\nwith the actual issue\n\n47:03.000 --> 47:05.000\nI mean people\n\n47:05.000 --> 47:07.000\nthe actual issue is legacy of a thing that\n\n47:07.000 --> 47:09.000\nactually factors into\n\n47:09.000 --> 47:11.000\nclass, right?\n\n47:11.000 --> 47:13.000\nclass, it's privilege\n\n47:13.000 --> 47:15.000\nit's\n\n47:15.000 --> 47:17.000\njust basically\n\n47:17.000 --> 47:19.000\nhow we see each other, I mean\n\n47:19.000 --> 47:21.000\nI think sometimes people think\n\n47:21.000 --> 47:23.000\nracism is bad but\n\n47:23.000 --> 47:25.000\nbasically we don't\n\n47:25.000 --> 47:27.000\nunderstand why racism\n\n47:27.000 --> 47:29.000\nis bad or why\n\n47:29.000 --> 47:31.000\nsexism is bad\n\n47:31.000 --> 47:33.000\nwe\n\n47:33.000 --> 47:35.000\nare focusing so much as a society\n\n47:35.000 --> 47:37.000\non pinpointing\n\n47:37.000 --> 47:39.000\nlittle individual things that people are\n\n47:39.000 --> 47:41.000\njust labeling, oh this is\n\n47:41.000 --> 47:43.000\nPC, now I have to be PC\n\n47:43.000 --> 47:45.000\nwe're actually\n\n47:45.000 --> 47:47.000\nlike\n\n47:47.000 --> 47:49.000\nfucking up the problem by going\n\n47:49.000 --> 47:51.000\nokay, here's the seminar that the\n\n47:51.000 --> 47:53.000\nlegal department can use to avoid legal\n\n47:53.000 --> 47:55.000\nliability, we're gonna teach all of you\n\n47:55.000 --> 47:57.000\nracist sexists how to seem\n\n47:57.000 --> 47:59.000\nless racist than sexists in the workplace\n\n47:59.000 --> 48:01.000\nthese are the things you're not allowed to say at the water\n\n48:01.000 --> 48:03.000\ncooler in order to keep Sony from getting sued\n\n48:03.000 --> 48:05.000\nand so this guy\n\n48:05.000 --> 48:07.000\nwho might become less racist or\n\n48:07.000 --> 48:09.000\nsexist watches the video and goes\n\n48:09.000 -->

know\n\n48:17.000 --> 48:19.000\nthat it might get him laid more\n\n48:19.000 --> 48:21.000\nfor instance to not say it\n\n48:21.000 --> 48:23.000\nhe doesn't know\n\n48:23.000 --> 48:25.000\nthat
