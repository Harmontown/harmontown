00:00.000 --> 00:25.000
Here we are, immersed in what can only be called an extinct bank vault, so this is fantastic.

00:25.000 --> 00:34.000
It looks like a prison in a bank. Harmontown is now in Session Road Island.

00:34.000 --> 00:53.000
Would you please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.

00:53.000 --> 01:04.000
Road Island! Did you want more music? No, no, no. That was the end of the song. Road Island.

01:04.000 --> 01:14.000
Some facts about Rhode Island, Jeff. Well, you just told me you didn't Wikipedia them. The typewriter was invented here? That's not true.

01:14.000 --> 01:42.000
It is the smallest state per capita. It is only 175 yards across. It is between the lower curve of the Tangiers River and the Colorado Peninsula.

01:42.000 --> 01:53.000
It is the most haunted state. Are there any famous ghosts? There are several famous ghosts.

01:53.000 --> 02:08.000
King Tut. Haunt is rumored to haunt the Biltmore, which is just down the street. Charles Dickens apparently roams the old First Street promenade.

02:08.000 --> 02:27.000
Still warning children about the events of Halloween 1912. And also Connecticut haunts Rhode Island. Why is that? Just jealousy.

02:27.000 --> 02:38.000
Ever since Rhode Island was invented, Connecticut became yesterday's news. It suffered a sort of public relations death. It felt unjustified.

02:38.000 --> 02:47.000
If you still listen very quietly, you can still hear Connecticut weeping in the winds of the Rhode Island expressway.

02:47.000 --> 02:58.000
All right, I didn't do any research. I figured it was a small state we could get away with one night of just hanging out. A lot of you probably came here because we begged you to at the Boston show.

02:58.000 --> 03:11.000
And still others of you who weren't begged probably came in. What, Rhode Island's like 30 feet across? What are the odds that anyone's actually from within the boundaries of the state? Who do we have here that's actually a Rhode Islander?

03:11.000 --> 03:25.000
Clap. Don't raise your hands. Well, yeah, actually a shit ton of people. The entire population of Rhode Island. How big is Rhode Island? What's the actual...

03:25.000 --> 03:47.000
35 by 40 miles. 35 by 40 miles? I would have no idea if that was a joke or not. You could tell me 350 miles. I don't have any sense of the scale. I know that when you look at it on the Internet, it's one of the few states in the U.S. where they have to have that little magnifying glass thing come up.

03:47.000 --> 04:01.000
They can't just put the red dot on it that it has to have a little inset where they're like, it's over here. I mean, I think that's nothing to be ashamed of. I don't know what having a big state gets you. I think that's stupid.

04:01.000 --> 04:17.000
It kind of defeats the purpose of being a state. Like, how are you supposed to make all those people happy? What kind of laws are you going to pass? Pass out law on Rhode Island, you know that it's like firmly set because it's like only a couple people like said this. No, no smoking.

04:17.000 --> 04:23.000
For real. Me, Carl and Dave said so.

04:23.000 --> 04:33.000
Now, there's a reason, Dan, that I didn't Wikipedia Rhode Island today because he was very busy. Oh, yeah, I turned in my CBS script for today.

04:33.000 --> 04:49.000
I've been kind of, you've probably sensed in the previous two or episodes that I've been a little preoccupied. I wasn't really letting my hair down that much. It was because I had something, I had that on my mind.

04:49.000 --> 04:54.000
And now I'm done. Now I'm free clear.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
You've got like 48 hours to write a whole other script, don't you?

04:57.000 --> 05:06.000
Yeah, yeah, for Fox, yeah. But that's going to be the next community. That's not going to be a problem. That's fine. That's going to come easy.

05:06.000 --> 05:20.000
The CBS thing was like rolling a brick up a hill because it's like, Jesus Christ, why is everything double spaced? That's how they like it. They like it double spaced. They like more cameras and more pages over there.

05:20.000 --> 05:27.000
It's not easy. And you have to write in, did you know this when you write a multi-camera script, you have to write in where the people laugh?

05:27.000 --> 05:38.000
Did you know that? No, you don't. No, I'm kidding. That would be amazing. People laugh and then people chuckle and people go, ooh.

05:38.000 --> 05:48.000
Can we do a reading of the script tonight?

05:48.000 --> 05:57.000
I don't know. I don't think we're allowed to. That's ridiculous. They paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for it. I can't read it.

05:57.000 --> 06:01.000
$10 worth? Yeah. Give us like one couplet.

06:01.000 --> 06:09.000
I did some tasty fade-ins. That's $10 worth of...

06:09.000 --> 06:22.000
I used the letter Q quite a bit, ways you might not expect. I'm legally liable now. The letter Q is used eight times in the script. You know too much.

06:22.000 --> 06:30.000
It's about a guy and his daughter. You can't really get deeper than that in a multi-camera sitcom. It's about a guy and his daughter. It's about relationships, Jeff.

06:30.000 --> 06:40.000
Multi-camera sitcoms are not a baser art form. In fact, they are in television terms more classic, obviously. We started with the honeymooners when we started making sitcoms.

06:40.000 --> 06:48.000
We started with the idea that these were plays that were adapted for larger audiences, but at their heart were a couple hundred people watching something reacting together as human beings.

06:48.000 --> 07:00.000
They may seem to our new cinematic savvy eyes as being somehow more primitive or cheesy or watered down or silly, but I think that's just because a lot of them are written very poorly.

07:00.000 --> 07:09.000
I think that I turned in one that's superior to everything on television. I think I'm going to revitalize the whole format. I think people are going to be going,

07:09.000 --> 07:21.000
Why? Why? Why? Why? Why doesn't everyone laugh at everything all the time when you're watching it? It's going to bury the voice and American Idol and Major League Baseball.

07:21.000 --> 07:30.000
Everyone's going to start watching shows about guys in an apartment that can't make the rent and have a dog forever.

07:30.000 --> 07:40.000
I think this is a nice-looking place. Dave and Corey, that's their names, right? The guys that run the place? Dave and Corey? Am I getting that right?

07:40.000 --> 07:53.000
Dave and Corey are too modest to call out, yes. They were interior design guys before they opened this club. That's not a joke.

07:53.000 --> 08:04.000
They told me, and their Wi-Fi password is DaveCore2630. Why would you tell them that?

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
Well, because if anyone wants to get on the Wi-Fi...

08:06.000 --> 08:12.000
Oh, I see, okay. Just fragment this audience to pieces. We can probably check on our Facebooks.

08:12.000 --> 08:24.000
And I said, are you guys 26 and 30 years old? Because I know my passwords often have my ages attached to them. When the thing says you have to have a number, I just stick my age on there.

08:24.000 --> 08:36.000
So over the year, I'm like, God damn it. Was I 37 or 38 when I started getting into feet? When I went through my latex phase.

08:36.000 --> 08:42.000
How many porn passwords did you think you have? It's impossible, Jeff. An impossible calculation.

08:42.000 --> 08:51.000
Fortunately, I lose my credit cards enough that they expire by virtue of... I just get a lot of emails going, we tried to bill your credit card, yeah, fuck you.

08:51.000 --> 08:57.000
That's what you get for your sneaky ways of capitalizing on people in a moment of weakness.

08:57.000 --> 09:09.000
I'm not only a porn addict, I'm also a drunk, so I lost my wallet again. So I jerked off only as much as I needed to.

09:09.000 --> 09:20.000
But no, Dave and Corey are not 26 and 30, but that's how old they were when they started their first business.

09:20.000 --> 09:33.000
I thought that was cool. I don't know. It's funny the way that we have public things like Wi-Fi names and license plates and things that...

09:33.000 --> 09:39.000
You can open a little hobbit door and go into all of a sudden you're finding out things about people.

09:39.000 --> 09:45.000
For example, Jeff... I don't have an example. I don't know what's so cool.

09:45.000 --> 09:50.000
I've known you for a long time. You've gone through a series of fetishes or maybe...

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
Let's talk about that.

09:52.000 --> 09:56.000
It's Rhode Island. Where's this going to go?

09:56.000 --> 10:03.000
Are you on something new that I don't know about? Have you gone down a new rabbit hole into finding out questions?

10:03.000 --> 10:07.000
What have I been into tracing my... I wish I could trace history.

10:07.000 --> 10:21.000
For those of you who've listened before, I was at Dan's apartment years and years ago and he had taken all these individual pages out of titty mags and playboys and stuff and put them in a manila folder.

10:21.000 --> 10:26.000
Rather than having all the magazines around, he just took out the pages that were potent.

10:26.000 --> 10:34.000
Right. Anybody ever do that? That's probably a thing. Oh, God. Is it Marissa? Is your mom here again?

10:34.000 --> 10:42.000
Yeah, we brought this girl's mom on stage last night and we talked about masturbation and it was touching go.

10:42.000 --> 10:50.000
Oh, I'm good by accidents. That was accidental gold.

10:50.000 --> 11:05.000
Anybody over... I would estimate 30. Any guy over 30 might know about that process where maybe you'd have to be over 35. The consolidation phase when you're like...

11:05.000 --> 11:16.000
I've never met a guy who didn't have this problem. You tend to hoard pornography. You can't throw it away.

11:16.000 --> 11:24.000
We get bored with it. You look at a picture of a certain person. See how inclusive I was there?

11:24.000 --> 11:31.000
You can be like, holy shit, this is amazing. This is right up my alley. Okay, great.

11:31.000 --> 11:40.000
But it's like any MP3 or anything, or a piece of chewing gum or anything, it's just a picture. It's not Erin McGathy at the end of the day.

11:40.000 --> 11:50.000
Nice save. Nice save. It's not someone you can love who brings you steak salads when you're working on your pilot and who serves you tea when you have the sniffles.

11:50.000 --> 11:57.000
And he cuddles up with you in the morning and he looks like a little baby strawberry cuddled up under your comforter.

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
She just gave you the business backstage about sneaking a nacho though.

12:00.000 --> 12:09.000
Yeah, well, she cares about me. She wants me to live long enough and I'm 12 years older than her. Sometimes she'll sit me down and go, Dan, you're going to die.

12:09.000 --> 12:16.000
You got to eat good. Is she the specter of death?

12:16.000 --> 12:24.000
She puts her hand on my face and spreads her fingers in a weird way and says, you're going to die. You're going to die. She cares about me.

12:24.000 --> 12:40.000
But even though the pornography loses its flavor, guys, I'm not going to say back me up on this. But if anyone who is the exception to this rule, I'd love to talk to you.

12:40.000 --> 12:55.000
I can't throw it away. And now we've gone into this age where it's on your hard drive instead of under your bed in a box or something, but back before the Internet made all periodical pornography obsolete,

12:55.000 --> 13:06.000
there were these magazines and if you were like me and you were in your 20s and you were like, okay, I'm going to get another one because everything loses its flavor, but you can't throw the old ones away.

13:06.000 --> 13:11.000
What I'm describing is you found my manila folder full of consolidated porn.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
The greatest hits.

13:13.000 --> 13:23.000
Just out of sheer bulk, I got to clear the decks here, but I'm going to take the pages out that are most important and I'll put them all in a manila folder that was about this thick.

13:23.000 --> 13:30.000
And Jeff was going through them. Oh, I'm sorry, this thick. I've held up my hands about two inches. Two inches thick.

13:30.000 --> 13:37.000
Jeff found it and was going through it. It was like, what is this? That's my porn consolidation file.

13:37.000 --> 13:43.000
When I moved from such and such to such and such, I consolidated to save U-Haul space.

13:43.000 --> 13:49.000
And he's looking through it and he goes, geez, you got a thing for redheads, huh?

13:49.000 --> 13:53.000
And I was like, I do? And then I looked through and they were all redheads.

13:53.000 --> 14:03.000
Not an exciting story, but very interesting that I didn't see that. But then you started going down a road of mannequin legs, nylons on mannequin legs,

14:03.000 --> 14:08.000
videos about women under the table popping their shoe off their heel.

14:08.000 --> 14:16.000
Then you bought the real doll. We didn't see you for a year until you fucked her head off or something. What happened?

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
The head started to kind of tear at the neck.

14:18.000 --> 14:31.000
That sounds violent. Anybody that works in television special effects will tell you that latex and silicon and stuff, that stuff degrades.

14:31.000 --> 14:37.000
And then you see these ads for, oh, buy a fake woman made out of this stuff and you're like, ah, it's the perfect crime.

14:37.000 --> 14:43.000
I'll take myself off the market. I'll spare all these poor women. I'll spare myself. Everyone will win.

14:43.000 --> 14:51.000
But then six months later, it's like the heads falling off. It's awful. It's awful. It's really grody.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
So where are you at now?

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
Because when do you throw that thing away?

14:54.000 --> 15:02.000
If you keep a magazine, when do you throw away your $6,000 rubber woman?

15:02.000 --> 15:05.000
You just roll her up in a rug and throw her off the 101 freeway.

15:05.000 --> 15:10.000
Awful. Thank God I had an assistant by that time.

15:10.000 --> 15:15.000
You made someone do it for you?

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
Yeah, yeah.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
How did she or he dispose of it?

15:18.000 --> 15:29.000
Ask her. I went on a road trip. That crate better be gone when I get back. It's depressing.

15:29.000 --> 15:33.000
It came in a crate that's like a Stephen King thing.

15:33.000 --> 15:42.000
Think of the alternatives. Is it supposed to come in a spider web? Is it supposed to come in a cocoon? Like a gremlin?

15:42.000 --> 15:46.000
So where are you at now? What's floating in your boat now?

15:46.000 --> 15:52.000
I don't know. I don't know.

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
You don't know that you can tell us or you don't know what it is?

15:55.000 --> 16:05.000
Well, I'm in a relationship now. Number one, it's not so much about exploration. When you get the chance or have the urge, it's more of a shotgun thing.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
You're just like, all right, I'll tell you whatever.

16:07.000 --> 16:15.000
Also, because I'm in a relationship, it's really not the time to get that specific, like, contrary.

16:15.000 --> 16:21.000
I don't know. It feels like the past is more, you're more allowed to be honest about the past.

16:21.000 --> 16:24.000
Let's talk about yesterday.

16:24.000 --> 16:28.000
Green-haired, middle-aged women I was into.

16:28.000 --> 16:32.000
Oh, I thought you meant like...

16:32.000 --> 16:35.000
Erin flyered for the show today.

16:35.000 --> 16:46.000
She's so dedicated to my happiness that she printed up a thousand flyers for the show and just took them around to hand out to people.

16:46.000 --> 16:56.000
Is anyone here because of the flyer?

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
Way to go.

16:58.000 --> 17:03.000
That doesn't mean the flyering was ineffective. It only means that she forgot to put the showtime on them.

17:03.000 --> 17:12.000
It was a very hasty, love-motivated job. It was less about engineering and more about an expression of wanting me to be happy.

17:12.000 --> 17:18.000
I was told that the first flyer she handed to somebody, a girl goes, oh, that's great. What time is the show?

17:18.000 --> 17:25.000
And I was like, oh, fuck.

17:25.000 --> 17:29.000
What time is the show? That's what's weird. The answer is 5.30.

17:29.000 --> 17:34.000
For those of you in podcast land, the sun is still streaming in through the Rhode Island skylights.

17:34.000 --> 17:39.000
There's a cat lazily napping on the warm sidewalk.

17:39.000 --> 17:47.000
There's eggs on the griddle, and we're doing a little comedy, a little conversative comedy before Bobcat Goldway comes on at 6 p.m.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
7.30, I think.

17:49.000 --> 17:58.000
This is the second time that we have found ourselves inadvertently opening for Bobcat, and I'm going to do some checking after the show.

17:58.000 --> 18:02.000
Actually, I'm going to do some checking with Bob, who we know and love.

18:02.000 --> 18:11.000
We don't know from Bob if the same woman at our agency is doing the booking of his shows, because if she's the one...

18:11.000 --> 18:21.000
If the reason why every time we're in the same town as Bobcat is because she's double booking rooms, I'm going to kick her in the fucking forehead.

18:21.000 --> 18:29.000
Because I don't know how funny you guys feel at 5.30, but you should just be thankful that I'm an alcoholic,

18:29.000 --> 18:33.000
because no one should be this drunk at this time.

18:33.000 --> 18:39.000
Backstage, you're feeling pretty cocky about yourself worth, and you're talking about your powers as a writer.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
You're hulking out back there.

18:41.000 --> 18:44.000
Yeah, what's different? What do you mean?

18:44.000 --> 18:47.000
I have a sociopathic edge to me right now, don't I?

18:47.000 --> 18:52.000
Can't you hear the kind of weird, cold, even temper to my voice?

18:52.000 --> 18:58.000
Don't I seem like a little soulless and kind of into myself?

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
I'm an apologetic.

19:00.000 --> 19:29.000
Let's just, as a barometer, I just want to do a little experiment just to see how different you are tonight from other nights.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
I fucked your mama on the corner of her nose.

19:32.000 --> 19:37.000
I fucked your mama and a tree grows out of her face where I fucked her.

19:37.000 --> 19:41.000
That's how fertile my semen is.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
It's pretty good, it's pretty good.

19:43.000 --> 19:48.000
I think you're about there.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
I don't know.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
You know my mama's dead, right?

19:52.000 --> 19:55.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So's Erin, so's everybody's.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
Big, big whoop-de-doo.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
Maybe it's because you keep all your dead moms.

19:58.000 --> 20:04.000
Maybe it's because you keep fucking people and trees grow out of their face.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
All I do is express myself.

20:06.000 --> 20:09.000
Maybe I wish I had a dead mom.

20:09.000 --> 20:14.000
That's another way of saying it.

20:14.000 --> 20:18.000
Mom, if you're listening, that doesn't mean I wish you were dead.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
It just means I wish I had a dead mom.

20:20.000 --> 20:26.000
It's two different things.

20:26.000 --> 20:29.000
I mean, it's like...

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
Would you for rap purposes?

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
Because obviously you don't literally mean you're going to fuck my mother.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
Are these people's mothers?

20:34.000 --> 20:37.000
Would you ever rap about fucking your own mother?

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
Yeah, sure, I would.

20:39.000 --> 20:51.000
I fucked my own mom. It was amazing.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
Skies were hazing.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
It was judgment day.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
I fucked my own mom in an intimate way.

20:57.000 --> 21:00.000
I curled up with her in a hamlet bed.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
I said, oh baby, gonna kiss your head.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
I would go down to your collar bone.

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
I'm gonna fuck you like I was alone.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
I'm gonna jerk off on your tinny and your knee.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
I'm gonna fuck you like I only fuck me.

21:11.000 --> 21:14.000
I'm gonna roll you over and fuck you from behind.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
I'm gonna fuck you pussy and see what I find.

21:16.000 --> 21:19.000
It's a wedding ring. It's my dad's.

21:19.000 --> 21:24.000
Aw shit, fucked you bad. I fucked you.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
Fuck you.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
Freudian style.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
Yeah, that's pretty good. That's good.

21:30.000 --> 21:42.000
Did you see, I don't know if you saw, between where I said, I forgot Oedipus's name.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
Oh, is that what you started scramming with?

21:44.000 --> 21:47.000
Yeah, I fucked it. I was like Orpheus? What is it?

21:47.000 --> 21:48.000
Right.

21:48.000 --> 21:52.000
That's a senior moment. I lost the word Oedipus.

21:52.000 --> 21:55.000
You don't get more primal than the word Oedipus.

21:55.000 --> 22:00.000
If you're talking about fucking your mom and you forget the word Oedipus,

22:00.000 --> 22:07.000
you get a couple of scripts left in you before you need to...

22:07.000 --> 22:11.000
Hunter the old Thompson.

22:11.000 --> 22:15.000
Foster the Wallace.

22:15.000 --> 22:18.000
Spalding your grave.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
Hemming your way.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
Yeah, what? What are the continued groans?

22:22.000 --> 22:25.000
Wait, that guy killed himself.

22:25.000 --> 22:28.000
Wait, so did that guy.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
Three guys that killed...

22:30.000 --> 22:33.000
Those are all right. What are you...

22:33.000 --> 22:37.000
This next one better be a florist that lived forever.

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
That's another great of a killer.

22:39.000 --> 22:42.000
How am I going to fucking freak out?

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
Spalding grace from Rhode Island.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
Spalding grace from Rhode Island.

22:46.000 --> 22:49.000
Oh, nice. I knew that. Full circle. Thank you, sir.

22:49.000 --> 22:53.000
Really, originally, he was born in Rhode Island. Did he live here?

22:53.000 --> 22:56.000
I was so bummed out when he killed himself.

22:56.000 --> 22:59.000
I mean, I get bummed out anytime anyone kills themselves,

22:59.000 --> 23:02.000
but I don't know about most of the people.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
And I really, really respect it, Spalding Gray,

23:04.000 --> 23:07.000
and as I'm sure a lot of people here did.

23:07.000 --> 23:10.000
It's such a fucking bummer.

23:10.000 --> 23:14.000
Yeah, like these talented people.

23:14.000 --> 23:19.000
A fan in the Brooklyn show came up to me

23:19.000 --> 23:22.000
and gave me a David Foster Wallace novel

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
that I never knew David Foster Wallace wrote,

23:24.000 --> 23:27.000
because I just thought that David Foster Wallace was an essayist.

23:27.000 --> 23:30.000
I didn't really actually know that he was an amazing novelist.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
Was that John Lennon?

23:32.000 --> 23:33.000
He's not a great fan.

23:33.000 --> 23:34.000
Infinite Jest or another man?

23:34.000 --> 23:35.000
Yeah, Infinite Jest.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
That's a big-ass book. That's like a phone book.

23:37.000 --> 23:40.000
So I simultaneously learned that David Foster Wallace

23:40.000 --> 23:43.000
had written a novel and that he had killed himself

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
in, I think, 2008.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
I didn't know either of those facts.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
I bought that book the day before he died.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
It was really weird.

23:50.000 --> 23:53.000
Haven't read it.

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
That one's especially tragic, because, I mean,

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
I think they're all probably, I don't know,

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
there's probably linkage to...

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
It's just so clearly kind of chemical,

24:01.000 --> 24:06.000
like he was on meds and he had to go off of them

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
because they were causing him trouble,

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
and then he started to have troubles.

24:10.000 --> 24:13.000
And it just sounds like...

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
When people kill themselves,

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
it's kind of by definition you think,

24:17.000 --> 24:18.000
well, that's a voluntary act.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
If someone gets hit by a subway train

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
or hit by lightning or gets cancer,

24:22.000 --> 24:25.000
that's by definition an involuntary act.

24:25.000 --> 24:28.000
But when people are kind of chemically troubled

24:28.000 --> 24:31.000
and there's medication involved and then they can't...

24:31.000 --> 24:35.000
It's weird because it's as involuntary,

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
it seems, as getting hit by a train.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
Like if you caught this person on the right day

24:39.000 --> 24:42.000
at the right time and gave them the right thing

24:42.000 --> 24:45.000
in their pancake syrup or something,

24:45.000 --> 24:48.000
you could keep them from making this decision

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
that was going to last forever.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
Terrible, awful.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
Hey, let's do the raffle!

24:54.000 --> 24:59.000
Everybody look under your seats.

24:59.000 --> 25:02.000
But we're giving away lithium tonight.

25:02.000 --> 25:05.000
If you think you need it, please use it,

25:05.000 --> 25:08.000
especially if you're an incredibly talented writer.

25:08.000 --> 25:11.000
I will never do that, I don't think.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
I'm not talented enough

25:13.000 --> 25:16.000
and I'm too chicken shit and too...

25:16.000 --> 25:22.000
I don't think I could never picture myself doing that.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
But at the same time,

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
didn't Spalding Gray do it

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
because he was in a lot of physical pain?

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
Wasn't he fucked up?

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
Yeah, he was in an auto accident in Ireland

25:32.000 --> 25:35.000
and he came back and he couldn't ever get over that.

25:35.000 --> 25:38.000
Yeah, it was... I mean, that must be...

25:38.000 --> 25:41.000
To repeat that in case we didn't pick that up,

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
he was in an auto accident in Ireland

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
and he never got over it,

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
meaning I'm assuming the pain never...

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
that was chronic and he couldn't handle it.

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
Or those people that they have,

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
like, what's the thing with your ears ringing?

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
Tintinabulation or whatever.

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
And it just drives them insane

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
that they can never get this sound out of their ears

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
and stuff like that.

26:01.000 --> 26:04.000
That's madness. Jesus Christ.

26:04.000 --> 26:07.000
Let's all fucking kill ourselves right now.

26:07.000 --> 26:10.000
Would you guys do that?

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
We're on the...

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
I'm gonna count to three.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
And it's on three, you guys.

26:16.000 --> 26:19.000
It's not one, two, three, go.

26:19.000 --> 26:22.000
It's one, two, bang.

26:22.000 --> 26:25.000
Jeff, how would you do it?

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
Kill myself?

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
Not jump off something. That's crazy.

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
That's crazy. How would I do it?

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
All those people that jump off the Golden Gate Bridge,

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
which is enumerous.

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
Hey, Erin, can you hear me?

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
Yeah.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
I think you remembered this number.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
How many people jump off the Golden Gate Bridge every year?

26:43.000 --> 26:46.000
It's something like...

26:46.000 --> 26:49.000
I mean, the stat was weird.

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
It's eight every two weeks or something.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
Yeah, okay. Eight every two weeks, she said.

26:53.000 --> 26:56.000
So, like, four every week.

26:58.000 --> 27:01.000
Some of them are doing it because, you know,

27:01.000 --> 27:04.000
math was never...

27:04.000 --> 27:07.000
So, a couple hundred...

27:07.000 --> 27:10.000
Yeah, a couple hundred a year, one more?

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
Yeah, that's...

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
Wait, is that really 60 a month?

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
That can't be right.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
Oh!

27:24.000 --> 27:27.000
Wow, we...

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
I hope we picked that up.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
Oh, I have an answer.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
I think we're having to report this from the back

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
of a town hall on Rhode Island.

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
It's about a...

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
I have my answer.

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
I would firing squad.

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
I would do a fucking old school firing squad.

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
You see the footage of a firing squad,

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
and the guy's there, and he's got a cigarette,

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
and he says,

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
and then they go, bang!

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
He's fucking gone.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
He's in heaven or hell the next moment.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
It's not electric chair or pills

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
or the carbon monoxide in the garage.

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
I would absolutely...

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
And also, like, there'd be the drums,

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
and you'd be like,

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
I'm fucking doing this right.

28:07.000 --> 28:11.000
This is some 17th century shit going down here.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
That's how you do it.

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
I don't know, too much...

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
Too much suicide information.

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
And that's not even suicide.

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
I'm gonna try to play it off,

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
like you're gonna...

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
We know what you did.

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
I would make a time machine,

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
go back in time, and try to kill the king.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
And then they would ask me

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
how I wanted to die,

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
and it would be death by...

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
Well, I'd be killing myself

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
by choosing to die by...

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
I wanted to kill myself.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
I'm gonna go hang myself.

28:51.000 --> 28:55.000
No, I'm not gonna go hang myself.

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
The show's not going that bad.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
You're doing great.

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
I'm gonna go with hanging myself.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
Really? That seems...

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
That's not so clean.

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
You dangle, you pee yourself, and then...

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
Yeah, but people do it just, like, sitting.

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
Like, they do it on accident

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
while jerking off,

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
which means that you can do it

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
kind of like...

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
If you can accidentally do it

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
while you're jerking off,

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
that means it must be pretty painless.

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
Yeah.

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
And the guy from in excess, right?

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
No.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
No, no, no. I don't mean David Carradine

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
was in any excess.

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
I was adding to his list.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
David Carradine did autoerotic asphyxiation,

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
we believe, and the lead singer of in excess.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
But I wouldn't want to die with my dick in my hands.

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
Well, no, I'm not...

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
I'm not gonna jerk off.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
I wouldn't even be hard.

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
You just blasted a dick in your hands

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
and a belt in your ear.

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
Those guys accidentally killed themselves

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
while jerking off.

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
We don't know that.

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
Yeah, we do, because their dicks were in their hands.

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
I'm saying that, therefore,

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
because you're able to do it

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
while having that much pleasure,

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
and so, obviously, those guys had everything

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
to live for in that moment,

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
they would have stopped if they had known,

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
oh, shit, I'm dying!

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
They would have stopped,

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
and the fact that they were dying to stop it,

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
which means, to me, perfect death.

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
Because it means

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
that you could actually sit

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
in a relaxed position

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
and arrange a thing around your neck,

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
a ligature.

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
Are you kids listening?

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
And do enough

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
with your own weight

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
that you could lose consciousness

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
and drift off into infinity.

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
But second to that, carbon monoxide,

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
for the same reason, because it happens on accident

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
when you don't stop it from happening.

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
So I think you could go to sleep.

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
I'm scared of pills, because I think you would...

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
You might...

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
So I go to the front and go,

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
this is a great show.

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
This is exactly...

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
Last night, they were fucking mamas,

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
and they were like,

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
everyone's gonna die tonight.

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
All right.

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
Before we get off this topic,

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
I'm just curious about it.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
Who here has killed themselves?

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
Well, who here would do it

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
jumpin' off of somethin'?

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
There's a couple hands.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
I'm not gonna make you come up and talk about it.

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
I just wanted to see, like, percentage.

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
There's four or five or six people.

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
And I think it's weird.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
It's not like a bell curve, where it's like,

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
a bunch of people would do it by shooting themselves,

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
and then 10% of people want to burn to death.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
It's almost like a weird, like, fractal...

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
I don't know, pattern.

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
Everyone's a little snowflake

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
of suicide.

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
Most importantly, I think nobody would kill themselves.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
Let's make an agreement.

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
No suicides tonight.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
I feel like legally I have to...

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
APPLAUSE

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
Legally, I have to say that real quick

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
before we part that topic.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
Let's come up with a new reason

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
for all of us to live.

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
We all have our own reasons.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
Let's find out...

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
Obama's inauguration.

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
This little community that we've created here tonight,

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
this audience has its own...

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
...organism. Let's create a brand new reason

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
to never kill ourselves.

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
To see Dan's new show.

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
To see Dan's new show is a good reason?

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
While you're getting stuff from the audience,

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
I'm creating a new reason myself, back here.

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
Dan has come back to the sandwich cart

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
to make himself a nice new vodka on the rocks.

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
Erin McGathy came backstage

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
while we were getting ready,

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
and she was very excited because she was like,

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
hey, guys, Erin from last night

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
at the show outside of Boston is here.

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
They were like, oh, yeah, cool, she was cool.

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
I said, oh, the black girl, right?

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
She's like, yeah.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
I'm like, is that why you're telling us?

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
Is that why that's interesting?

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
And she was like, yeah, as a black Erin.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
I've never met a black Erin before.

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
Black Erin.

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
Yeah, black Erin, get up here, would you?

32:53.000 --> 33:09.000
MUSIC

33:09.000 --> 33:13.000
It proves that race is an artificial construct.

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
There's a black Erin.

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
Are you okay coming up here?

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
You're such a sweetheart.

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
I met last night in

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
that place that's not Boston, Somerville.

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
You look kind of dressed like a black Erin.

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
I could see Erin McGathy if she were black,

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
dressed like we like that.

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
It's an Erin outfit, I didn't even, yeah.

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
She got little black tights on and stuff like that.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
I'm so obsessed with race, I didn't even, yeah.

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
You were here, you were in Somerville,

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
and you came, you were with this dude

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
that, is he here tonight?

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
He's here, yeah.

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
Oh, okay, because I thought, didn't you say,

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
what was your name, sir?

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
Matt.

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
I remember having a conversation about this,

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
I was trying to figure out what your MO was,

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
weren't you like,

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
you're not from any of these places, are you?

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
No, I'm from Colorado.

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
Colorado.

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
You're staying with your friend Matt

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
for the Somerville show.

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
Well, Matt's from Vermont.

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
We...

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
We decided to

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
come to Boston

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
for the Somerville show,

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
and since Rhode Island is close,

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
we decided to come down here too.

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
And then, but then,

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
I'm wrong saying,

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
are you going to a third show too?

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
I'm going to Denver too. Right, because that's in Colorado

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
where you're from. Yes, yes.

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
Okay, that's where the confusion is,

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
because that's where I was saying, oh, is Matt

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
going to be there too, and you're like, no,

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
because Matt's from around here. Right.

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
All right, all right, it's not that intriguing.

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
I thought I would stumble on

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
a story like Spree or something.

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
Like, you guys were...

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
There was a trail of receipts.

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
We could turn you in.

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
Erin was saying that there was some interesting story

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
to why your name is Erin. Is that true?

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
Oh, well, I was just mentioning

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
in Freakonomics,

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
I told Erin that

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
there's a chapter about naming children.

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
How...

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
It's harder

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
to get a job

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
when your name is something like, you know,

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
something more ethnic sounding.

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
And my mother made sure

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
that all of her children's names

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
were neutral sounding,

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
or sounded, you know,

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
she wanted to make sure that we'd be able to

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
at least get her foot in the door.

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
Has that worked out for you? What do you do for a living?

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
I'm a professional letitia.

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
I'm a...

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
Right now, I'm a student.

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
Okay, what do you study?

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
I'm studying web design and computer programming.

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
Oh, fantastic, so yeah.

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
Your less ethnic name

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
has given you that foot in the door?

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
I think it's a lot of things.

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
And I honestly,

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
I can't tell because

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
I've lived my entire life

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
with being an Erin,

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
and...

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
Yeah.

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
There are some pretty crazy names, though.

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
My friend had...

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
I went to school with a girl named Exquisita,

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
which is awesome. Wow.

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
Wow.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
It kind of brings up a weird

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
and probably uncomfortable topic, though.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
The idea that, like,

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
it comes up over and over again.

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
The idea of things that are somehow...

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
like, that we identify as cultural,

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
and then the things that, like,

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
you know, Bill Cosby rails against.

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
Like, there are two sides of this spectrum where...

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
And then,

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
you can put yourself in any shoes,

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
or I can anyway, as a weird,

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
mixed up white guy.

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
Like, I can't find a place where I'm comfortable

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
going, oh, that's the empirical fact,

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
because, like, there are people

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
who would go, well, don't...

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
don't assimilate, and then there's a...

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
like, well, what are you assimilating?

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
Like, what...

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
It's all so fucking confusing,

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
because it all starts with

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
co-opting humanity,

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
bringing people over,

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
giving them a job they didn't ask for,

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
for far below their pay grade,

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
denying them,

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
you know, some staples,

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
and literacy, etc.

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
And then, at some point, changing our mind about it,

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
which is a great, great, great

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
turn of events.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
But, and then,

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
now all this,

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
like, now,

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
a complexion being linked

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
to empirical realities,

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
demographically,

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
like,

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
wealth distribution and things like that,

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
but it being conveniently racist

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
to point out any correlations

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
that are unpleasure,

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
a Republican gets to go,

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
what do you mean? I thought everyone was equal.

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
What do you mean he's black, therefore he's poor?

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
What are you, a racist?

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
And then, like, it's...

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
it's awfully...

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
it almost seems like only the bad guys win

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
as long as we keep staying confused about all of it.

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
As long as we keep just kind of, like,

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
worrying about the fact that we're different.

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
And as it seems like that's the only

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
late motif, that's it,

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
and that that's the only empirical truth

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
that people kind of want poor people

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
to just be unsure about everything

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
that unites them.

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
BAM!

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
APPLAUSE

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
Oh.

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
I fucked your black mama.

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
I did it with my white dick.

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
So what?

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
I didn't care. I'm not racist.

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
I united humanity with my dick.

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
Black mama.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
I don't know. Aaron, do you have any opinions

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
about any of this stuff? I do.

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
All right.

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
APPLAUSE

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
Can you do them in two, four time?

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
Or do you want to...

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
Yeah, let's let it rip.

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
Do you want to beat?

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
No.

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
LAUGHTER

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
It's actually one of the reasons

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
I really like your show.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
I love this podcast is because

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
you have difficult

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
conversations about things like that.

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
It sort of feels like a

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
journal, you know, like

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
Dear Diary or something like that.

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
It definitely feels more like a journal

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
than, like, say, a screen player

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
or a TV show, something with structure.

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
LAUGHTER

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
That has a point to it.

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
But, I mean, it's important

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
to have difficult conversations

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
because whenever you don't talk about things,

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
then it doesn't make the things go away.

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
Exactly. Like, every single

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
problem can be solved.

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
I mean, okay.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
Like, we've been a human race

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
for quite a while, and I'm sure

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
that there were times

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
when there were bigger problems

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
than lack of communication.

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
Like, people just stabbing you

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
and fucking the stab-hole,

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
like, because you were, like,

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
from somewhere else.

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
I'm sure there was, like, shit

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
just happening right outside your front door

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
that had to be dealt with before

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
can be solved through people

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
speaking what's in their head, honestly.

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
And letting it, like,

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
because how far

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
does a person

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
who is our modern definition of racist,

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
how far is that person

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
going to be able to state their case

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
before solutions

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
start cropping up even to his own fucking brain?

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
Or hers?

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
LAUGHTER

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
Women can be racist. It's okay, ladies.

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
LAUGHTER

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
And it's, like,

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
people communicating about that.

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
And that's what makes me

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
sound to some people

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
like, incredibly jaded and cynical,

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
even though the weird, ironic truth

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
is that I'm so optimistic because

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
what I believe is that people,

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
once you start babbling,

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
like, the inevitable result

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
is that shit gets, like,

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
that you thought was important, stops being important.

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
Shit that you thought was

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
a monster stops being,

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
turns out to be your own reflection

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
or, like, your dad's ghost or something.

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
And the reality just becomes, like,

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
everyone looks so simple,

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
like, that we're on a playground again,

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
going, oh, I don't want to be alone.

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
If I had to choose anything,

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
I'd just choose to be around other people.

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
Let's work the rest out

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
as we have to.

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
But, yeah, that's so, I agree.

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
I agree that my podcast is great.

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
LAUGHTER

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
APPLAUSE

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
I have a question.

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
I mean, because I'm asking this

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
ignorantly, because you're black

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
and you're a woman, what's more

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
pervasive for you, racism in your life

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
or sexism?

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
What do you feel is the more prevalent

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
or the most, like,

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
you get the most dominated by?

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
You can ask a more hypothetical sci-fi sense.

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
Like, if you got to have one button

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
on your wrist that could make you switch,

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
like, but switch back

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
any time you wanted, like,

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
would you rather have a button

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
that turns you into a dude

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
whenever you wanted or a button

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
that made you white whenever you wanted?

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
I just made that up.

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
LAUGHTER

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
And you get to change back any time.

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
It's not about not liking yourself.

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
It's just about the social obstacles

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
or whatever kind of inconveniences.

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
Um...

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
I think that

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
I've probably never, ever

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
wanted to be a man.

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
I've never even considered it.

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
I think there was...

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
You know, every kid

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
has that moment in their life

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
when they... I haven't either, Erin.

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
I've never wanted this.

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
I didn't ask for it.

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
It's flapping around down there.

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
It seems very impractical.

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
I have nipples.

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
Sorry, go ahead.

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
You feel good.

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
It's okay.

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
I grew up in the suburbs

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
and I grew up around everybody.

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
Everybody else was white around me

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
and I think whenever I was a kid

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
I really didn't realize...

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
It's not that I wanted to be white.

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
I think that I just didn't realize I was black.

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
And so whenever I did realize I was black,

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
I was like, oh, well,

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
I don't want to be different.

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
Yeah, I had a lot of friends growing up

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
when I was in Milwaukee Public School.

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
When I was definitely in grade school,

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
it was like...

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
I think Howard Stern said the same thing

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
in his little movie that I saw.

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
He illustrated the same thing.

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
I was actually a lone little

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
white drop in a public school

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
see that I didn't really perceive

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
until later.

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
I have little photos of me

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
in graduation ceremonies

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
and it's like my head in a sea

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
of things that I now distinguish

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
but that I didn't instinctively do

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
back then.

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
We find it hard to believe as a racially obsessed society

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
that it actually is an artificial construct

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
but it is so much more artificial

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
than so many more real things

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
that we've actually also been hypnotized

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
to not pay attention to

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
that are more real.

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
Like poverty and wealth

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
and how that doesn't make you a good or a bad person.

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
We are very convinced

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
that poor people are their own fault.

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
That when you wake up poor, you're a piece of shit,

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
you did something wrong.

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
We're also very convinced that when you get sick,

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
you did something wrong.

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
When you're in a wheelchair, I get fucking

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
like I go into crisis mode

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
like my goal is to

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
figure out how to avoid

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
this poor person who probably

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
would be into talking about

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
what is wrong and what happened

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
and how hard it is and all this stuff

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
but all I can think about

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
through after school specials

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
and my own narcissism is like

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
fuck that guy, he's just gotta be a living ghost

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
or that's what's best for both of us

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
and that's way more real

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
in your skin

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
because there's a lot of

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
anyways, I keep sounding

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
like I'm running for something, it's stupid

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
but

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
I'm probably

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
flawfully fascinated

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
with this stuff

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
and I

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
what was our point, what were we on?

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
I derailed that, I derailed it.

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
We're talking about sexism, racism,

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
I mean sexism seems more real

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
because women are

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
chemically different from men, they literally

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
have no penis

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
from birth

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
there's an actual hole where the penis

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
goes on a man

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
and there's

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
this is true, no it's true

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
I'm just shaking my head back here

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
and

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
as an extension of sexism

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
then homophobia is actually a little more real

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
even though there's a huge difference

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
between homophobia and racism

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
but a homosexual

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
can walk around

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
and get a job and hang out

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
and if they choose to

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
they can never have anyone

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
or even themselves be conscious of the thing

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
that makes them different

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
inside

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
women can't, they can't escape

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
their gender

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
and to the extent that we keep paying attention

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
to race, people can't escape their race

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
what's my point?

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
I don't know

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
there's gotta be a card game we can make out of this

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
or

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
what do we, I think

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
is the problem solving itself?

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
we're getting, I noticed that

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
20 year olds are bored with

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
things that used to make

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
me laugh when I was 20

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
race used to be a much hotter

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
button when you mashed it as a comedy

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
writer, I can see

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
myself becoming antiquated

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
in writer's rooms, I can see

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
people like Donald Glover

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
going like, yeah

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
it's not that funny and it's not

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
indignant or anything, it's just getting

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
hackier and hackier to

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
mash those buttons

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
which I think is a good sign

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
is everything fading

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
is everything getting better?

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
sure

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
I think that things

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
move in cycles honestly

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
and it's really difficult to tell

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
especially with the recent history

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
of race in this country

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
I do think that

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
the problem with

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
people ignoring it and getting

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
bored with it is that they still haven't dealt

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
with the actual issue

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
I mean people

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
the actual issue is legacy of a thing that

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
actually factors into

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
class, right?

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
class, it's privilege

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
it's

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
just basically

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
how we see each other, I mean

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
I think sometimes people think

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
racism is bad but

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
basically we don't

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
understand why racism

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
is bad or why

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
sexism is bad

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
we

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
are focusing so much as a society

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
on pinpointing

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
little individual things that people are

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
just labeling, oh this is

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
PC, now I have to be PC

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
we're actually

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
like

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
fucking up the problem by going

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
okay, here's the seminar that the

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
legal department can use to avoid legal

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
liability, we're gonna teach all of you

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
racist sexists how to seem

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
less racist than sexists in the workplace

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
these are the things you're not allowed to say at the water

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
cooler in order to keep Sony from getting sued

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
and so this guy

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
who might become less racist or

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
sexist watches the video and goes

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
okay I can't say nice tits

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
and all he knows is that he can't

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
say it, he doesn't know

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
why, he doesn't know

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
that it might get him laid more

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
for instance to not say it

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
he doesn't know

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
that humanity is

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
an individual thing, he's not getting that from

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
a sexual harassment seminar

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
yeah, alright

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
let's do something

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
with Aaron that

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
that's both racist

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
and sexist

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
let's do

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
a little

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
I don't want to be too trite but I want to do

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
one of our little movies or TV shows

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
Jeff, I want to do like a little

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
I like that we've started doing this on the road

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
like

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
Aaron what's your

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
what's your big ambition, what do you want to do

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
like pie in the sky

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
dream gig

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
I would love to do something creative that

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
changes a lot of people

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
or affects a lot of people's lives

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
and what are you doing now to pay your rent

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
I work

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
I'm an Annie and I work at Banana Republic

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
two groups

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
gave me some vocal support

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
or one very specific person

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
I think Aaron should come up

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
white Aaron should come up and play black Aaron though

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
anything

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
Erin McGathy to the stage

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
in the role of a lifetime

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
okay

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
we're going to test your range right now Aaron

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
Erin McGathy

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
is going to win a Tony

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
for her portrayal

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
of black Aaron

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
Erin McGathy everybody

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
Aaron was also a nanny yes it's true

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
both Aaron's were nannies

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
you still are nannying

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
new Aaron

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
new Aaron

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
alright so

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
alright she's a nanny

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
she's worked at Banana Republic

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
and her mission is to

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
create things for people

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
just create things that will

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
change people's attitudes

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
change their minds

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
change your attitudes, change your minds

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
maybe open their minds

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
art or literature

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
I love to write

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
I love to draw

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
I want to be a graphic designer or web designer

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
just kind of creativity all across the board

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
that's great

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
that's a great aspiration

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
oh it's a new movie

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
it's called

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
black Aaron

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
transparent soul

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
transparent heart, soul

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
sounds racist

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
oh

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
dreams and peace

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
hey world

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
I'm going to work on changing you today

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
so what you're black

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
what I'm black

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
this is the moment when I realized I was black

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
I

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
what are you doing downstairs

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
Aaron it's your mother

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
making pancakes

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
honey leave her alone

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
she's going through a rough time right now

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
what do you mean she's my little girl

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
she just found out she was black

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
we should have told her a long time ago

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
oh god

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
you're going to have to go have one of those talks

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
that mothers give to their

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
similarly raced children

51:51.000 --> 51:55.000
alright I suppose this is the bed I made

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
Aaron

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
yes mom

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
your father told me about something that happened today

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
yeah

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
I guess it's

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
time to tell you about a world

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
that I tried to shield you from

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
by giving you a neutral name

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
I don't understand my name is Aaron

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
everyone named Aaron

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
is a mousy

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
or average looking white girl

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
ladies I'm sorry to interrupt

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
can I come in for a second

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
I feel like I've been a bad husband and father

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
to both of you and I'll tell you why

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
there's something I've been meaning to tell you both for a long time

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
you're both women

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
what

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
oh no that's fine

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
that's fine I'm fine with that

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
I'm fine with that

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
I feel like you should know that

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
mom I really hate dad

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
your father is an award winning

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
obstetrician

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
who's

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
given special accolades

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
for his ability to

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
notice gender

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
honey honey oh my god

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
the obstetrician society is called

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
I won the golden fetus

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
so go back to what you were doing

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
I have to go back out

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
and destroy creativity

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
in the world

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
did you hear that

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
he just said

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
that's just his way

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
the important thing is to love one another

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
I gave you a mousy

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
white girl's name because

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
I didn't want you to be one thing or the other

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
I wanted you to feel comfortable

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
in a world that

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
my dream is that these

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
problems that we're subjecting each other to

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
they'll just go away

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
alright that's very nice

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
good luck on your final exams

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
thank you mom

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
Matt no

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
I just want to know

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
if you still want to go to the snowball dance with me

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
Matt I have to focus

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
I mean if I'm going to change the world

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
with art or music

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
or graphic design

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
or something else or speech or something

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
first of all I'm going to have to spend some time

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
focusing and then I'm going to have to

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
do it

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
that wasn't a note Erin you're doing fine

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
I'm sorry

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
I thought I was going to get a big laugh

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
and I didn't I'm just going to get it she's the best

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
alright

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
well that's what I wanted to talk to you about

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
I have the answers to this final exam

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
you wouldn't even have to study

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
just copy off of me

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
and then and then you can focus

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
on being creative

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
or my name's not

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
Phil Dorfman

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
it's not it's Matt

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
Matt yeah Matt right

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
so I

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
I couldn't possibly trust you

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
look man

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
hello son I'm sorry

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
to bother you at school your name is actually

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
Matt I should have told you that a long time ago

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
oh

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
sorry go back to go back to what you're go back

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
to harassing that girl over there

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
listen she's black

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
hey I don't care

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
I've never had a reason to care

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
and I'm not going to have one today

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
okay so just copy off of me

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
and then you have time to be creative

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
and we could be boyfriend and girlfriend

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
and the world could be free of race

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
we could have a little beige baby

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
well I

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
gosh there's so many

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
so many things running through my mind

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
nine months later

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
push daughter push

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
push anybody else

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
anybody else

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
nobody in this town has won more awards

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
for delivering babies

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
than me

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
I'm a three-time golden baby award winner

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
and I will deliver

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
your baby

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
oh my god

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
he's coming up

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
he's coming up

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
it's hideous

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
it's hideous

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
don't mix the races

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
don't mix the races

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
okay well

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
that went differently than

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
transparent heart everybody

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
transparent heart

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
that did not

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
that

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
that was not the right

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
okay let's compare

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
notes my plan

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
my thought was that Phil

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
slash Matt would

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
who loved Erin regardless of her race

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
was going to have her copy off of his test

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
for his own convenience

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
his own visceral convenience

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
and then they were going to get caught by a teacher

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
and then he was going to throw her

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
under the bus and like

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
kind of like play the race card

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
the improv scene we were going to do

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
well I'm a fucking genius

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
I was like writing ahead

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
I certainly didn't intend to cut to the birthing

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
of a minotaur

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
which seemed like

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
it was like a cautionary tale against misogyny

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
what did we create

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
I'm saying we haven't figured out our problems

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
is this cast a

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
stark

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
a trenchant social commentary on the state of things

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
now

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
it's making us look at ourselves the way we actually

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
are the darker version of ourselves

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
as we actually are right now

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
I have to admit

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
I'm white Erin

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
I'm white Erin

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
definitely

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
in my head about playing

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
what is this look on your face

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
definitely in my head about playing black Erin

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
because when you're playing a character

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
you're like how is this character different

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
from me

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
but we're the same

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
we have the same sensibility

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
what's your take away from our little tale

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
what do we do right

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
what do we do wrong

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
oh black Erin

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
I thought it was

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
I thought it was great

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
alright

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
you know why

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
as much as you as a dominant white male

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
want to control the outcome of things

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
especially involving women

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
in communication

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
sometimes life takes its own course

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
only I as a white man know how to solve racism

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
and sexism

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
it is something I have been born with the equipment

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
to do

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
I was really excited Dan

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
that you got to show everyone what your newest fetish is

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
which is we pretend

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
that he's being born

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
from me

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
it's really exciting

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
alright well let's thank new human Erin

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
for coming up here

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
thank you

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
I'm so sorry

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
for everything

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
thank you

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
I hope we can heal the scarred world

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
thank you

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
isn't she lovely

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
so sweet heart

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
the big question is

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
if we see her in Colorado

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
then we didn't totally blow that

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
yeah that's the good metric yeah

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
hopefully she won't get the flu and send us the wrong signal

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
it'll be like a Romeo and Juliet thing

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
is Erin out in the audience

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
and then she's not and we're like

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
we really fucked up and then we kill ourselves

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
and then she shows up late and she's like

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
they killed themselves and then she kills herself

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
how did Jeff organize a firing squad

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
that quickly

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
Dan

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
why does Dan's dicks in his hand

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
I mean that's

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
that's an old

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
that's cross signal

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
was this a group suicide

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
or a ritualistic murder

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
slash orgy

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
I would jump off a bridge

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
oh all right

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
yeah there's a couple people who would

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
it's crazy

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
I don't know if it's

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
I don't know if I recommend watching that documentary or not

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
the bridge

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
I don't know if it's really a documentary

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
it feels ghoulish and freak

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
freak showish

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
I think the reason you're watching it

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
is because you want to watch people jump off the golden gate bridge

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
it should be called yes you get to see people die

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
yeah

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
it's not what you're watching

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
it's such the sad music and it shows people crying

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
on the golden gate bridge and then it just ends with

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
this repetitive just people just

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
plummeting and they just shot it

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
and so the whole time you're going you fucking shot it

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
come on this isn't journalism

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
and you shot it you could have run up and stopped them

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
but they just filmed people jumping off

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
shoot a bottle rocket at them

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
because they're shooting it from way down below

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
and the thing that was the clincher was like

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
okay because they kept interviewing this

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
one guy and I was like

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
this guy's family

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
I was like they kept talking about him and coming back to him

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
and I was like there's nothing building here

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
I'm not learning anything new

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
if I find out that he just jumped off the bridge

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
in the coolest way

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
if they just got the best shot of him

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
committing suicide then I'm fucking

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
that's the final word on this thing

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
and yeah I should go out

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
I was like why did I watch that

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
I was really like it really

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
it really fucked me up for a whole day

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
suicide's not the answer rap

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
okay

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
coming up

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
yo

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
yo

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
emcee lights

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
coming at you

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
oh yeah it's about to get positive

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
don't do it don't take it all

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
your mom and your dad gave you so much to call upon

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
study your math

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
don't drown yourself in the bath

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
if you want to strangle yourself

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
do it while you're jerking off

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
you might like it

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
and then stop doing it

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
and then you came harder

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
life

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
road island

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
may I ask something

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
this is a really self focused question

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
from you

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
2

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
earlier when you were asking

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
Dan about his fetishes

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
I just want to ask the audience

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
this is an honest question

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
and I will take whatever answer you give me

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
and this is not a leading question

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
I'm honestly asking you

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
because I'm sitting in the back

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
when Jeff was really drilling

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
Dan about what his new fetishes are

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
should I feel bad about that

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
should I

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
I was just fucking with him

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
no I know

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
but it felt

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
when I was sitting back there

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
is Jeff saying

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
in a very subtle way

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
that he doesn't respect our relationship

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
or is that okay

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
okay thank you

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
that's why I asked

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
I think the worst thing you can say about Jeff

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
is that he was trying to instigate us breaking up

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
by creating

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
a great podcast entertainment

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
I wouldn't put him past that

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
but he's not a gun

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
I'm not trying to bring the mood down

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
I was trying to shoot two arrows

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
well I'll see you guys at D&D

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
alright goodbye baby

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
speaking of D&D we should probably bring Spencer up right now right

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:29.000
there

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
oh yeah

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
his bag of holding

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
he does say bag of holding

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
again for those of you just joining us for the first time

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
this is Spencer our Dungeon Master

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:49.000
who's been traveling with us

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
where are Cory and Dave

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
respectively in the audience

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
where are they

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
they don't have to be in the audience

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
are you guys both back there

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
I was wondering

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
am I face blind

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
or is this guy either Cory or Dave

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
this is random guy

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
that's how weird

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
I have borderline prozopagnosia

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
I just realized we're going really late

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
what oh shit is bobcat

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
bobcat just called me

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
I just realized when do we have to get out of here

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
five minutes

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
two minutes speed round

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
I didn't know this was a bullet train show

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
that's totally my fault

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
bad calm trolling

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
it's a bummer

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
we're sad

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
we have to get out of here to load out

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
so that bobcat can load his audience in

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
so we're going to put it right to the limit here

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
so Spencer

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
get us up to date

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
you guys wake up you're inside of a giant beast

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
good job

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
I kill the beast

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
no oh shit

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
describe this beast

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
what are we looking at here Spencer

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
you wake up in the wreckage of a ship

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
it seems to be ripped asunder

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
although you're in a rather dark place

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
there seems to be some sort of ambient

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
light shining through

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
you can see the red walls of wherever

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
you're in through the cracks in the ship

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
go

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
I can see the what

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
you can see the red walls outside of your ship

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
you're obviously in some sort of red cavern

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
we got yeah we got

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
we got swallowed by an infinifish

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
that's what I was saying

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
for some of these guys the Boston episode

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
has an aired like it ended with

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
some weird flashback to a nursery

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
around my mom said about something called an infinifish

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
and then the ship got impacted

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
by a huge thing now we're waking up inside

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
so we're in the belly of the whale right now

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
you might just be

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
alright

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
well we also

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
learned in Brooklyn that ray of frost

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
it's the shittiest spell you have

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
ray of frost is like

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
go get me some ice

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
okay

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
are there squirrels or small woodland craters

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
I can summon inside this infinifish

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
no they're not

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
you could maybe summon an epiglottis

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
I

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
we can walk out into this

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
what is this

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
what are we looking at if we walk outside into this

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
enclosure exiting the

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
wreckage of the ship you see that you're at a bottom

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
of a great red pit

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
inky blackness stretches onward ahead of you

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
you can see globules

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
studded on the walls full of a

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
green glowing fluid

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
it casts light throughout the room

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
you see three white clothed figures

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
they approach from the north

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
I

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
yell out

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
hey

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
they slowly

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
approach silently

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
I tried everything I could

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
use your diplomacy talk to these guys

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
alright

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
I step forward hands raised up

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
to indicate

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
no weapons in them

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
no spells being cast

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
and I

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
I kind of do like a fancy bow

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
like I'm a fancy person

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
and then I

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
and I walk to them very gently

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
very gently and very diplomatically

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
they approach

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
I see you're a fancy gentleman

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
well

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
this is no place for your kind

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
we have a dwelling not far from here

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
you'd have to stick close

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
it's quite dangerous

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
who are you

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
we were swallowed by the infinite fish

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
many moons ago

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
we're trying to make the best of it

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
okay

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
well I think you probably good people to

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
go with in the short term

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
can my friends come

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
yeah alright guys

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
we should follow these guys

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
they've been here for many moons

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
we should go find people that know how to get out of here

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
well I mean

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
it's an infinite fish

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
they all left

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
of course yeah that's flawed logic

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
I say we follow them

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
especially since it's going to be a two minute episode

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
we're already over time right now

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
so we follow them

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
cliffhanger

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
cliffhanger

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
destroy your relationship

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000

in the place that you've never known

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
it's a magical realm

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
where all your dreams can come true

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
