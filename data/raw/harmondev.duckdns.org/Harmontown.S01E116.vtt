that there was a movie called flash dance if you're over if you're my age then\n\n04:43.960 --> 04:48.200\nyou know there was this movie called flash dance and you know that in that movie a woman\n\n04:48.200 --> 04:54.020\nis a dancer and a welder and you know that she dances and then pulls a chain and then\n\n04:54.020 --> 04:58.400\nwater pulls down full splashes down her and you know there's a steel mill involved you\n\n04:58.400 --> 05:03.880\nknow that roughly the same things about footloose does she weld wild dancing the steel mill\n\n05:03.880 --> 05:08.760\nbecame big in the 80s it was like a big it was a place you went to dance at the steel\n\n05:08.760 --> 05:14.480\nmill until Robo cop finally put a quirk in that said no this is a place you go to fucking\n\n05:14.480

got oculus riffs here they got I didn't go to the arcade yet they\n\n05:42.360 --> 05:46.400\ngot a they got an independent arcade here they make independent games which are always\n\n05:46.400 --> 05:52.080\nso awesome because it's like back to the basics do they take quarters no not like that that's\n\n05:52.080 --> 05:58.920\nthe bad part even more indie than quarters yeah they're almost indy of all change you\n\n05:58.920 --> 06:03.640\nknow as we as we progress as a society we find new ways to make computers think more\n\n06:03.640 --> 06:09.480\nthings faster and all too often we then funnel that all into graphics cards and go like how\n\n06:09.480 --> 06:14.600\ncan I keep this you know okay the fan can cool off this much processor this for this\n\n06:14.600 --> 06:20.320\namount of time so how how many how many angles how many triangles can we generate talking\n\n06:20.320 --> 06:25.080\nabout minecraft again well I'm indirectly I am yes because I think the other way is\n\n06:25.080 --> 06:30.440\nto go like okay no computers can do more now so let's like actually if it looks like pac-man\n\n06:30.440 --> 06:36.760\nyou can have pac-man do more shit like he could eat way more than a key we thought that was\n\n06:36.760 --> 06:42.040\nthe most pac-man could ever eat was a key I never got past cherries if I'm honest yeah\n\n06:42.040 --> 06:50.160\nyou got to get to the key bro cheese I don't know what were you level is the key on it's\n\n06:50.160 --> 06:57.600\nlike the maximum level you can't eat anything past a key and it makes sense why would you\n\n06:57.600 --> 07:04.360\nthat's words to live by right there you can't eat a key all right so here we are in Portland\n\n07:04.360 --> 07:13.560\nwhere my fiancee and I keep thinking we want to move to and I keep I imagine that there\n\n07:13.560 --> 07:18.760\nwas a okay there was you know there was you heard that a couple of people are into the\n\n07:18.760 --> 07:23.840\nidea exactly there there's I think there's a lot of people probably going don't move\n\n07:23.840 --> 07:29.840\nto Portland you fucking asshole not because not because of me but just because everyone\n\n07:29.840 --> 07:34.920\nstopped moving to Portland maybe I don't know how you guys feel about that do you want everyone\n\n07:34.920 --> 07:40.720\nto move to Portland some people do that's only some though I mean maybe they're new\n\n07:40.720 --> 07:51.280\nto Portland they're in the back because they just got here everyone else hates us good\n\n07:51.280 --> 07:57.720\ntime yeah I don't know I was I'm also fascinated with the the overcast weather thing because\n\n07:57.720 --> 08:03.480\nI love it people in Portland are so apologetic for it and people from LA they go no you don't\n\n08:03.480 --> 08:10.040\nunderstand I don't care I hate the sun the sun is is it you you want to kick it in the\n\n08:10.040 --> 08:16.480\nsun balls yeah I said that earlier on this fucking I came to Portland I was looking forward\n\n08:16.480 --> 08:23.440\nto hiding from this fucking yellow maniac this this fucking orange Hitler this this\n\n08:23.440 --> 08:30.840\nthis spherical fucking Ayatollah like lording over everything demanding everything of you\n\n08:30.840 --> 08:35.400\nreflecting everything I think in Portland I think I feel like their sidewalks are more\n\n08:35.400 --> 08:40.400\nreflective because they miss the sun so much that they're like it'll be here one day and\n\n08:40.400 --> 08:45.040\nwhen it's here there'll be a parade but like you come from LA and you're like why are you\n\n08:45.040 --> 08:50.680\ntrying to simulate the fucking godless desert that I came here from I just I want the gray\n\n08:50.680 --> 08:57.680\nskies and the shade and the the the dark boozy cloisters the independent video games the\n\n08:57.680 --> 09:06.280\nyogurt is you know there's no you guys they're not they don't they don't like yogurt here\n\n09:06.280 --> 09:13.400\nI might I might have got a mixed up with Seattle I don't know home of the yogurt someone told\n\n09:13.400 --> 09:19.920\nme backstage that they like yogurt here's here's one guy here likes yogurt here's something\n\n09:19.920 --> 09:23.760\nelse a guy told me backstage this is a little weird and I don't want this guy to kill himself\n\n09:23.760 --> 09:30.120\nand be telling the story but we admire him I want this guy is fine he should not be ashamed\n\n09:30.120 --> 09:34.920\nof himself but he should also understand that as I think he understood when he did this\n\n09:34.920 --> 09:40.520\nthat this is that he is the first person that has ever done this and I thought it was notable\n\n09:40.520 --> 09:49.280\nI was I was in the back hunched over a cooler getting my contractually required bottle of\n\n09:49.280 --> 09:55.400\nkettle one out of a few bags of ice and there's five people run back there and it's goodbye\n\n09:55.400 --> 10:06.000\nevening the but I was I was pouring a drink and this guy came back and he I'll do an impression\n\n10:06.000 --> 10:11.400\nof him and I please sir wherever you are don't feel bad about yourself but I have to share\n\n10:11.400 --> 10:16.280\nthis it's just interesting you did this to me I get to do it to everyone I get to turn\n\n10:16.280 --> 10:24.080\nit into something you're part of something a guy he came up and he said Dan Harmon and\n\n10:24.080 --> 10:31.640\nI said yes and he said look I he kind of he said something very quickly along the lines\n\n10:31.640 --> 10:36.240\nof like you know my friends told me not to do this and I thought maybe I should do it\n\n10:36.240 --> 10:45.440\nbut here we go and he was like oh my god this is how John Lennon died but he pulled out\n\n10:45.440 --> 10:51.240\na phone and I was like oh he wants a picture I'm a very handsome person I approve of this\n\n10:51.240 --> 10:56.280\nbut then he opened the phone and then he just opened it up and he went like I'm gonna make\n\n10:56.280 --> 10:59.560\nI'm gonna make this up because I think this kind of person like values the intellectual\n\n10:59.560 --> 11:03.600\nproperty he was reading so I'll make a new thing up but he's like Alan Alda plays a\n\n11:03.600 --> 11:07.200\nMidwestern man who's transported to a different dimension of a single and he just rattled\n\n11:07.200 --> 11:12.440\noff he just he just he just read a pitch off of his phone he just read it off of his phone\n\n11:12.440 --> 11:18.080\nthat's so much guts though I could never do anything close to that why because of your\n\n11:18.080 --> 11:26.080\nconscience yeah yeah what what horrible wall is between you and that brave act\n\n11:26.080 --> 11:38.000\nempathy I mean empathy is what it is not a wall it is an invitation empathy it's not\n\n11:38.000 --> 11:46.480\na wall it's not a wall that keeps you from being a sociopath it's not like video games\n\n11:46.480 --> 11:53.720\nwhere there's a thing you can't do so you just fucking try to do it the walls in society\n\n11:53.720 --> 12:05.880\nare there sometimes because very brave though very brave very bright murder arguably right\n\n12:05.880 --> 12:13.200\nno one denies that murderous other brave people throughout society Hitler Abe Lincoln Hitler\n\n12:13.200 --> 12:22.480\nJohn Wayne Gacy Jeffrey Dahmer Taylor Swift Taylor Swift Kanye West Kanye West running\n\n12:22.480 --> 12:29.800\nup and saying Taylor Swift give me that microphone fuck you it was brave and yes bravery is a\n\n12:29.800 --> 12:38.200\nmoral descriptor agreed it has nothing to do with good or bad there are brave Ted Bundy's\n\n12:38.200 --> 12:43.960\nthere are brave George Washington's there are brave Japanese senators there are brave\n\n12:43.960 --> 12:59.320\nKu Klux Klan dragons it is brave to fuck with people it's terrible but brave it's an interesting\n\n12:59.320 --> 13:08.360\nI meet some brave people so did John Lennon John Lennon went out meeting one of the bravest\n\n13:08.360 --> 13:18.520\npeople he will ever meet so forgive me for not putting a high value on bravery I'm not\n\n13:18.520 --> 13:24.680\nputting a high value in my old age notable as I travel the country I start to put something\n\n13:24.680 --> 13:30.800\nlike you know tacked higher than bravery that's me that's my self interest I'm like oh that's\n\n13:30.800 --> 13:36.960\na tactful man I appreciate him more maybe I'll conflagrate them and then go like you\n\n13:36.960 --> 13:45.720\nknow what it's brave to be that tactful tax is brave no it's not tax can be brave and\n\n13:45.720 --> 13:52.120\na tactless very cowardly I think I mean not that I'm very taxful and I'm very I'm a huge\n\n13:52.120 --> 13:57.640\ncoward I don't know how I don't know how brave tact is how cowardly I mean that's that's\n\n13:57.640 --> 14:05.240\nlike I that's a huge question I am a I am a I am a I don't I don't think I have a right\n\n14:05.240 --> 14:14.040\nto say this about myself but I just as a just as a shortcut a autistic type and a lot of\n\n14:14.040 --> 14:32.440\nmy fans are like dramatic as pergatastic and I and I love them and you yourself I you Spencer\n\n14:32.440 --> 14:37.800\nis my dungeon master chauffeur and personal assistant and he picks me up in the morning\n\n14:37.800 --> 14:44.640\nand I get into your Subaru and I I some we can drive for a half hour and not talk to\n\n14:44.640 --> 14:48.400\neach other yeah sometimes you play your podcast of those guys that play those Nintendo songs\n\n14:48.400 --> 14:52.880\nand then argue about what genre they are and stuff and this yeah we just I'm just listening\n\n14:52.880 --> 15:00.400\nto 16-bit music from Spencer's youth it's like and and and then sometimes we'll listen\n\n15:00.400 --> 15:05.680\nto a podcast about you know how they're made or dolphins and sometimes we'll talk about\n\n15:05.680 --> 15:10.400\nMinecraft but we don't have to do anything I don't have to look at you we don't look\n\n15:10.400 --> 15:13.640\nat each other we'll never get mad at each other you'll never like slam a door and I'll\n\n15:13.640 --> 15:20.240\nbe like baby what's up I just you know it's been a long time since you said you appreciated\n\n15:20.240 --> 15:29.080\nme that is a luxury we have as Vulcans then there's this handicaps when we deal with other\n\n15:29.080 --> 15:33.880\npeople they go like sometimes they slam doors and we go what's going on I don't understand\n\n15:33.880 --> 15:37.000\nwell it's been a long time since you said you appreciated me well I don't know what\n\n15:37.000 --> 15:41.880\nthe fuck you're talking about also just close the door and be mad yes can't you just stop\n\n15:41.880 --> 15:52.800\nfeeling things yeah isn't it on you the thing that's making you cry unplug it why is this\n\n15:52.800 --> 16:04.280\nsolution to make me fucking more that when I'm still able to saw wood while ignoring\n\n16:04.280 --> 16:14.760\nyour feelings what if aliens attack and they go quick get them they're all crying you'll\n\n16:14.760 --> 16:19.960\nbe the only survivor damn well they will turn to us and they will go Asperger people help\n\n16:19.960 --> 16:26.560\nus there are worm men from the moon attacking us and we'll laugh at them yes well we'll\n\n16:26.560 --> 16:32.720\nperish yes and then they'll go yeah you're laughing you're human and I will die the anyways\n\n16:32.720 --> 16:38.120\nwhat was my point I was saying like I'm used to these interactions and I value them I like\n\n16:38.120 --> 16:45.680\nI like people who can't make eye contact with me I like I like people who want to have honest\n\n16:45.680 --> 16:50.880\nconversations and sincere ones and get down to the nitty gritty but there's also there's\n\n16:50.880 --> 16:57.440\na there's a cowardly version of tactlessness there's the I don't make small talk version\n\n16:57.440 --> 17:03.040\nand then there's the actually I do I am gonna say what's easy I am gonna just like barf\n\n17:03.040 --> 17:08.640\nup some weird shit because I think that it's like some kind of weird strategic way to put\n\n17:08.640 --> 17:14.080\nyou off kilter and you know make you vulnerable and you can see that technique being implied\n\n17:14.080 --> 17:17.880\nand you're like what are you trying to do why are you so you think that saying hello\n\n17:17.880 --> 17:22.640\nI I like you is like something weak people do so you're gonna say you're gonna insult\n\n17:22.640 --> 17:28.320\nme or you know put me off and I'm gonna like hang a you know a Star Wars metal around your\n\n17:28.320 --> 17:34.000\nneck and go like you're the first person that ever like barfed shit on me and an elevator\n\n17:34.000 --> 17:40.560\nthat's what those people aren't right like that happens a lot to people who like you\n\n17:40.560 --> 17:45.400\nlike people are like I'm sure everyone does this so I'm gonna but then all of those people\n\n17:45.400 --> 17:51.680\nare doing that exact same thing I yes I mean but but I would I would put a big asterisk\n\n17:51.680 --> 17:58.420\non that and say that anyone that that it likes me is better than other people like I buy\n\n17:58.420 --> 18:03.200\nin large like because by the time you make it over those walls see that's like you are\n\n18:03.200 --> 18:11.600\na marine you are a better person so even my worst fan I think would beat you know Kevin\n\n18:11.600 --> 18:18.640\nSmith's best fan in a in a fan off I don't know just in a general like I feel like and\n\n18:18.640 --> 18:23.800\nthat please I hope that gauntlet doesn't get too thrown down that's the last thing I need\n\n18:23.800 --> 18:29.720\nwell weird because you know use if someone likes me I'm a self-hating individual someone\n\n18:29.720 --> 18:35.840\nlikes me I instantly hate them like I just I don't trust them it's like why they need\n\n18:35.840 --> 18:38.760\nto earn your trust

what we do is we bring\n\n19:59.600 --> 20:02.800\nup people who have traveled the farthest but that would be kind of pointless here because\n\n20:02.800 --> 20:08.280\nwe've traveled so I want to

blinking Houston they take\n\n24:42.200 --> 24:49.040\nyou up and they drop you into the Statue of Liberty's torch same with Edinburgh Scotland\n\n24:49.040 --> 24:57.720\nand you say it like you say it like like butter you go and butter and butter yeah and butter\n\n24:57.720 --> 25:09.200\nand butter anyways McKenna so how long have you lived in Portland around 11 years wow okay\n\n25:09.200 --> 25:18.760\nand so since you were three yeah the the so you moved here from where I'm from Oregon\n\n25:18.760 --> 25:25.440\nright so we're still in our south of here all right oh so you just you you you're like me\n\n25:25.440 --> 25:30.480\nin Wisconsin you you were you were you were born in a vat in the suburbs kind of like\n\n25:30.480 --> 25:36.080\nsomewhere in a basement your parents hit you with a belt and then sent you to move to the\n\n25:36.080 --> 25:45.000\ncity yeah all right and said I'm gonna show all of you Madison guy just yelled out yes\n\n25:45.000 --> 25:56.640\nthat is a city in Wisconsin I think that's the guy that read me the pitch I can't tell\n\n25:56.640 --> 26:02.920\nI can't tell I don't think so it's bright the lights are bright but I mean you haven't\n\n26:02.920 --> 26:07.120\nlived until and they just reciting it and then he was like hey but I figured what the\n\n26:07.120 --> 26:16.960\nhell and I'm like yeah what could it hurt you to read me a pitch I don't have a pitch\n\n26:16.960 --> 26:22.000\nfor you thank you there's gonna be a gunshot from the back and my career is gonna be over\n\n26:22.000 --> 26:27.920\nfor the dumbest reason in the world not because you're dead though right because the other\n\n26:27.920 --> 26:35.240\nguy because the other guy all right don't try to keep track here have you ever listened\n\n26:35.240 --> 26:47.960\nto this podcast oh okay yes the so my fiance and I have been to Portland now probably like\n\n26:47.960 --> 26:56.560\nI think between us five times the last time it got pretty severe the Portland thing like\n\n26:56.560 --> 27:02.760\nit gets in your blood you're into it yeah yeah like it happens we want to move here\n\n27:02.760 --> 27:07.080\nso I and I can't get a read on the Portland people because usually the next thing that\n\n27:07.080 --> 27:12.280\nhappens when you want to move to a city is you talk to somebody and they say everyone\n\n27:12.280 --> 27:18.000\nfeels that way fuck off the reason you feel that way is because nobody's moving here but\n\n27:18.000 --> 27:22.600\nyou're but you're a good example because a lot of people come here like now in the summertime\n\n27:22.600 --> 27:28.280\nand they're like Portland's amazing and then they actually move here and it's like ten\n\n27:28.280 --> 27:35.800\nmonths of shit right but you're but you when you guys say shit you mean my favorite thing\n\n27:35.800 --> 27:45.840\nin the world which is Blade Runner weather every day is Blade Runner like I don't want\n\n27:45.840 --> 27:52.480\nto walk around in a fucking awesome trench coat and I think the shitty weather like creates\n\n27:52.480 --> 27:59.000\ncooler people kind of like you know you go to somewhere sunny and people are all right\n\n27:59.000 --> 28:04.960\nbut you come here and everybody's like maybe a little angsty but creative and making things\n\n28:04.960 --> 28:09.640\nwell the sun is I mean the thing is when you go to a restaurant there's there could be\n\n28:09.640 --> 28:15.920\na culture where people say to you you know you know the best place to sit is right by\n\n28:15.920 --> 28:21.840\nthe kitchen the source of all restaurants things that's where all the food is made that's\n\n28:21.840 --> 28:25.680\nwhat the sun is you don't want to sit near the kitchen it's also really shit it's a\n\n28:25.680 --> 28:31.480\nfucking fusion reactor in the sky it's giving you cancer it's like it's it's it's burning\n\n28:31.480 --> 28:40.960\nyour children it's it hurts magnificent characters like powder remember that guy that's that\n\n28:40.960 --> 28:45.800\nguys the best our planet can do like and he doesn't want the sun you know who powder\n\n28:45.800 --> 28:52.200\nis for it yeah he has psychic powers and he's not yes the sun technically like the kitchen\n\n28:52.200 --> 28:57.160\nin a restaurant it makes things happen yes that's where the shrimp goes into the basket\n\n28:57.160 --> 29:02.720\nI don't want the booth next to the fucking kitchen I want to be in the dark corner like\n\n29:02.720 --> 29:08.960\nI want to be in an indirect result of the sun yeah so appreciate the sun for what it\n\n29:08.960 --> 29:16.400\ndid but you don't need to like yes I'm a fan of the sun like it's like like Paul Verhoeven\n\n29:16.400 --> 29:26.520\nlike like good job a while ago and and for that I will never turn my back on you\n\n29:26.520 --> 29:36.240\nthe sun is the Quentin Tarantino of the solar system like permanent decision made I rely\n\n29:36.240 --> 29:43.640\non you I think you were amazing you know kill Bill being a two-parter is fine if that's\n\n29:43.640 --> 29:56.360\nwhat comes with it so but does the rain get to you over time when you\n\n29:56.360 --> 30:06.440\nbut you don't know because you were in Oregon already like you Oregon Oregon yeah that's\n\n30:06.440 --> 30:14.800\na small violation that's I didn't say Oregon I said Oregon oh what I think that's what they\n\n30:14.800 --> 30:23.040\nwere doing yeah okay I mean that's a lame thing to hold your ground on that's that's\n\n30:23.040 --> 30:29.360\none vowel like what do you guys do to Canadians I mean I'm sure they come they probably call\n\n30:29.360 --> 30:37.720\nit Brigadoon here the that doesn't make any sense the but but but you you you were born\n\n30:37.720 --> 30:46.320\nunder an umbrella yeah so it does though yeah around like June when it's still like shitting\n\n30:46.320 --> 30:52.040\non you you start to get a little that's the June gloom right yeah you start to get a little\n\n30:52.040 --> 30:56.760\ncrazy and right now everybody's very happy cuz they're like oh the sun's out and it's\n\n30:56.760 --> 31:01.640\ngonna start rain yeah and like the Oregonians I think about now are like okay I'm ready\n\n31:01.640 --> 31:08.200\nto start wearing coats again like I don't people are very conflicted about now I just\n\n31:08.200 --> 31:14.560\nrealized we've been talking about the weather and our podcast I'm so sorry I apologize what's\n\n31:14.560 --> 31:21.280\nthe opposite of the weather in conversation do you believe in God McKenna let's just skip\n\n31:21.280 --> 31:27.840\nto why not well after today I'm questioning cuz he made it so wonderful that you're thinking\n\n31:27.840 --> 31:36.000\nof converting back to know where your parents religious no not at all I never went to church\n\n31:36.000 --> 31:40.520\ndid you resent them for not being a religious no come on you wanted a little bit of God\n\n31:40.520 --> 31:46.120\nI'm very open-minded because of it so they were nice intellectual parents yeah they let\n\n31:46.120 --> 31:51.480\nme go to church with like my friends and I would go to church and be like fuck this is boring like\n\n31:51.480 --> 31:56.840\nwhat is happening then you come home and they're like I told you I told you to go to an orgy\n\n31:56.840 --> 32:12.680\nyeah okay all right fucking Portland there's sacrilegious here so what's the what's the\n\n32:12.680 --> 32:18.320\ntrying to think of the opposite of talking about the weather what's the worst thing you've ever\n\n32:18.320 --> 32:28.120\ndone to another human being that's a really hard question yeah I know I asked that of a\n\n32:28.120 --> 32:35.280\npodcast guest at one point and he immediately knew and it was he made he made his brother drink\n\n32:35.280 --> 32:43.040\nhis own pee but just he gave him it told him it was lemonade and I I've definitely done a few\n\n32:43.040 --> 32:47.560\nthings like that when I was little or like dirt mixtures that you give to like the neighbor girl\n\n32:47.560 --> 32:57.080\nlike no no you know the thing where you make the girl eat the dirt like no you need to tell us\n\n32:57.080 --> 33:04.640\nabout that little hazing what did you do what's the dirt what's the dirt girl story because\n\n33:04.640 --> 33:10.400\nit's not universal I definitely I mean that there was definitely a little girl that lived\n\n33:10.400 --> 33:15.640\nacross the street from me who was like probably five years younger or something so of course\n\n33:15.640 --> 33:21.720\nshe was like super excited to hang out with the older like I'm so cool you know like hang out\n\n33:21.720 --> 33:27.320\nwith the cool older girl and it was like you know torture so your instinct to haze yeah\n\n33:27.320 --> 33:30.440\nyou're like yeah that's what we were just talking about people that like you there was\n\n33:30.440 --> 33:39.400\nsome dirt with like vanilla flavoring and water in a cup and be like here this is good yeah yeah\n\n33:39.400 --> 33:46.960\nand then she ate it yeah and then like would go home and cry because she ate dirt yeah how old were\n\n33:46.960 --> 33:57.400\nyou at that point maybe like 23 30 like 12 yeah that means I mean that's when you're like the\n\n33:57.400 --> 34:04.400\nbiggest asshole well you don't have you know human human people we don't have like what we define\n\n34:04.400 --> 34:09.160\nas I don't know whether you some people would call it morality some people just call it a\n\n34:09.160 --> 34:13.840\nconscious conscience like we don't have that compass built into us we're the most adaptable\n\n34:13.840 --> 34:17.680\nspecies on the earth and we you don't you don't get there by having some ingrained thing that\n\n34:17.680 --> 34:22.200\nwe won't do like we'll do anything to anybody that our parents tell us okay and we kind of like\n\n34:22.200 --> 34:27.360\nwe we learn kind of over time we're like oh you know what life is more fucked up if we keep doing\n\n34:27.360 --> 34:31.560\nshit that we just want to do and we don't start thinking about other people but like eight year\n\n34:31.560 --> 34:37.120\nolds are sociopaths they're they're just like pull the wings off a shit and like like yeah and\n\n34:37.120 --> 34:42.960\nyou they I don't I don't what's unclear is do they learn do they biologically hit a point where\n\n34:42.960 --> 34:47.800\nthey're like okay I'm gonna stop doing that or do or do you just have to stop them like you kind of\n\n34:47.800 --> 34:54.920\nwant to like make a big iron cube maybe in this steel mill and like drop a bunch of human children\n\n34:54.920 --> 35:00.480\ninto it and just do a bunch of experiments but then you'd realize wait maybe I'm doing this\n\n35:00.480 --> 35:07.720\nbecause I didn't learn how to be moral I know that I know that your brain is made out of all\n\n35:07.720 --> 35:13.440\nthese like you know there's like there's a biological capitalistic like board meeting in your\n\n35:13.440 --> 35:19.800\nbrain every day where where different departments of your brain kind of compete for resources and\n\n35:19.800 --> 35:26.480\nso when you're a kid like if they say that if you raise a kid in an environment where I can't\n\n35:26.480 --> 35:34.080\nstand up and I think we should all try this tonight that if the kid comes out of that like\n\n35:34.080 --> 35:41.560\ntwo foot high like you know crawl space at an age after their legs are fully able muscularily to\n\n35:41.560 --> 35:48.800\nwalk they even if you like give them like regarding Henry physical therapy they will never\n\n35:48.800 --> 35:54.200\nbecause their brain that part of their brain the one that dedicates resources to motor function in\n\n35:54.200 --> 36:00.880\ntheir legs has long ago been zoned out during some city board meeting in its brain I was like no\n\n36:00.880 --> 36:07.640\nthere's no need to walk this person needs to navigate darkness and crawl hand over hand and\n\n36:07.640 --> 36:14.160\nchange light bulbs or whatever they're doing down there telekinesis maybe some people just\n\n36:14.160 --> 36:20.200\nrealize how to only be an asshole when they're young I think that I think that the I think that\n\n36:20.200 --> 36:25.640\npot it's possible I'd like to be more optimistic than this but I think it's possible of it being\n\n36:25.640 --> 36:35.680\nthat compassion might be like facial recognition walking you know being good with feng shui these\n\n36:35.680 --> 36:41.440\nmight just be little little talents we have and being compassionate actually yields positive\n\n36:41.440 --> 36:47.160\nresults you know long-term for kids on the playground hopefully I'm sure it's that yeah I\n\n36:47.160 --> 36:50.360\ndon't think it's inherent but that's a bummer though that's like thinking they were all like\n\n36:50.360 --> 36:55.640\nthese empty canisters of just flash that are just waiting to be either made into serial killers\n\n36:55.640 --> 37:02.320\nor saints yeah that's that's the whole land somewhere way between some bummer I guess I\n\n37:02.320 --> 37:06.760\nthink it's awesome but it's also kind of yeah it's kind of amazing at the same time because\n\n37:06.760 --> 37:12.480\nthen some people grow to be so amazing yeah well it's the same but what's a but what about them\n\n37:12.480 --> 37:18.000\nwhat about the lack of meaning to being amazing like do you why is it like it just happens at\n\n37:18.000 --> 37:23.840\nrandom but the randomness makes it beautiful you're saying I think so why can you like the\n\n37:23.840 --> 37:30.400\nrole of a die but why is that more beautiful why is chaos more beautiful than than purpose\n\n37:30.400 --> 37:35.160\nbecause it's uh it's like the antithesis of everything we seek it's like oh we're just\n\n37:35.160 --> 37:39.480\ngoing the wrong way about it we just got to accept that it's randomness and derive meaning\n\n37:39.480 --> 37:45.440\nout of that I think that's cool like I mean it's one thing to like catch on to a meaning that\n\n37:45.440 --> 37:49.320\nalready exists that's like seeing a bird but it's another thing to like you know like I'm\n\n37:49.320 --> 37:56.880\ngonna invent the bird it's a common a common example I think we can all relate to creating\n\n37:56.880 --> 38:04.680\nour own foul right so I say I don't know if I have the ability to articulate this you're\n\n38:04.680 --> 38:13.720\nsaying that within if we accept that our nature is chaotic we can achieve a meta order yeah\n\n38:13.720 --> 38:18.720\nwell also just that like okay so if it was predestined that I was supposed to just say I\n\n38:18.720 --> 38:23.720\nmean be here today that's not very interesting that's a that's a that's part of a list there's\n\n38:23.720 --> 38:29.040\na long list of things like the fact that I'm here because of several crazy random factors\n\n38:29.040 --> 38:33.680\nthat could never happen to anyone else just because of sheer probability and stuff I find\n\n38:33.680 --> 38:40.800\nthat amazing and more potentially miraculous than like someone with a plan making making\n\n38:40.800 --> 38:44.960\nthe rules for everything I don't know like our friendship is the result of a random occurrence\n\n38:44.960 --> 38:48.400\nyou came to the show and I said is there a dungeon master here and you raised your hand\n\n38:48.400 --> 38:55.920\nand now we're friends yeah and and more than friends employees right view yeah I wear many\n\n38:55.920 --> 39:03.000\nhats but that same chaos means that I could have a strange happening in my brain that\n\n39:03.000 --> 39:06.040\nmakes me lunge across the table and rip your face off because I think it's a sandwich which\n\n39:06.040 --> 39:12.360\nis also really fascinating right but you will die will you die going like I'll life I'll\n\n39:12.360 --> 39:18.360\ntake three I don't think you can take three that's the problem right all right maybe\n\n39:18.360 --> 39:22.800\nthat's my problem I want to buy life in bulk maybe it's just that I'm a dungeon master\n\n39:22.800 --> 39:28.000\nthough because I just everything I do is rolling dice it's all randomness and then we start\n\n39:28.000 --> 39:33.960\nto understand that those same rules of dice rolling are just genetics and particle collisions\n\n39:33.960 --> 39:38.760\nit's all just all these weird probabilistic things that happen it's I think that's just\n\n39:38.760 --> 39:44.640\nlike understanding the code to the universe and the idea that your brain is well it's\n\n39:44.640 --> 39:51.000\nlooking at the die rolls is the result of a bunch of die rolls over billions of years\n\n39:51.000 --> 39:56.080\nand hundreds of billions of years if you go I mean like the big bang forward like random\n\n39:56.080 --> 40:03.280\ncollisions turning into RNA turning into primordial soup turning into evolutionary Cold War or\n\n40:03.280 --> 40:07.920\nhot war between organisms resulting in the biological weapons survival wise that is your\n\n40:07.920 --> 40:13.680\nbrain that in addition to recognizing red apples and yellow bananas is able to recognize\n\n40:13.680 --> 40:20.840\nnumbers on a die and create a game that is based on random numbers so you're using the\n\n40:20.840 --> 40:27.440\nend result of a bunch of randomness to look at infantile randomness simulations of fundamental\n\n40:27.440 --> 40:32.240\nrandomness and we have fun and we pretend that there's order we pretend that there's\n\n40:32.240 --> 40:38.240\ngood guys and bad guys and and we but we and we seek meaning but but you can find peace\n\n40:38.240 --> 40:42.400\nby accepting that there is no meaning yeah and I mean what you're talking about order\n\n40:42.400 --> 40:47.120\nis like the only order is what we add to it you know it's what we're ordering around in\n\n40:47.120 --> 40:55.000\nthe randomness I think that's a cool part of it thanks man I appreciate that but what\n\n40:55.000 --> 41:05.000\ndoes that have to do with pushing can you hear me Portland more like pushing land sorry\n\n41:05.000 --> 41:17.760\nspeaking to pussy let's bring my fiance up here we have to figure out I'm gonna stand\n\n41:17.760 --> 41:26.760\nis there I think we don't have enough there's another mic you set I can coach it no no no\n\n41:26.760 --> 41:33.120\nwell that's I don't know no I want you to set like on the pedestal that you belong on am\n\n41:33.120 --> 41:37.920\nI am I still want to be put on a pedestal being me down by putting me up and you stay\n\n41:37.920 --> 41:46.800\nseated oh you're from Portland I got to be a girl but I love your hair oh thank you\n\n41:46.800 --> 41:52.240\nlooks great like a mermaid mare of a fairy grove yeah everyone listens to the runway\n\n41:52.240 --> 41:56.520\nI've seen a ton of girls with purple in their hair and I was kind of like I want to like\n\n41:56.520 --> 42:02.960\ngather all of us together and get like a group purple hair shot because I feel like most people\n\n42:02.960 --> 42:09.640\nhave purple I'm down for any color but purple seems to be a popular I felt like when I was\n\n42:09.640 --> 42:14.800\nlooking for people that were lived closer to this steel mill the hair got more purple\n\n42:14.800 --> 42:21.200\nas I hope I hope five years from now we don't find out this is some kind of cluster the\n\n42:21.200 --> 42:25.120\ncool color remember a couple weeks ago when you came home and my hair was gray I was trying\n\n42:25.120 --> 42:32.920\nto do that I love the gray actually like I thought it for fall I might go gray oh man\n\n42:32.920 --> 42:38.400\nthat look amazing it's like witchy witchy yeah have you seen the gray with Liam Easton\n\n42:38.400 --> 42:49.960\nso I'm going for it doesn't matter what color your hair is the wolf will eat you he's a\n\n42:49.960 --> 42:56.360\npredator a biological killing machine he doesn't care about your hair it doesn't matter if\n\n42:56.360 --> 43:02.600\nwe make a fire doesn't matter if we wake up doesn't matter how many legs you have doesn't\n\n43:02.600 --> 43:09.280\nmatter if they're in the snow doesn't matter if we walk five feet or five hundred feet\n\n43:09.280 --> 43:16.800\nit's it doesn't matter that we're here it the wolves may walk by not see us it doesn't\n\n43:16.800 --> 43:23.360\nmatter if they don't see us they might smell us if the sequel to the gray took place in\n\n43:23.360 --> 43:30.040\nPortland and there was that same monologue what would that sound like it doesn't matter\n\n43:30.040 --> 43:37.440\nif they're uncouch it doesn't matter if they're the sandy hut doesn't matter if they enjoy\n\n43:37.440 --> 43:43.160\nshuffleboard if they're a day drinker or a hipster drinker it doesn't matter if they\n\n43:43.160 --> 43:50.480\ninnovate it doesn't matter if they remember that they used to make yogurt hair it doesn't\n\n43:50.480 --> 43:57.680\nmatter if the video game is independent or corporate it doesn't matter if women are\n\n43:57.680 --> 44:06.840\nproperly represented in the video game genre the wolf will still eat you we're arguing\n\n44:06.840 --> 44:11.480\nabout about whether or not the Tomb Raider should have big tits but the wolf just sees\n\n44:11.480 --> 44:33.320\na hot dog I want to talk I want to talk about one thing I want to talk about the plane ride\n\n44:33.320 --> 44:39.880\nhere and the fact that I've noticed this because I've traveled by plane enough to know that\n\n44:39.880 --> 44:47.720\nthis isn't a fluke sometimes okay let me start with all the time all the time the food is\n\n44:47.720 --> 44:57.120\nbad yes yes the peanuts are too small the every time without exception everyone in this room\n\n44:57.120 --> 45:03.120\nwho's ever been in a plane no one will argue with this every time you're on a plane the\n\n45:03.120 --> 45:11.440\nposition of your seat back is catastrophically important to them the people who are in charge\n\n45:11.440 --> 45:17.000\nof whether you live or die because the plane is a piece of equipment that is defying physics\n\n45:17.000 --> 45:23.200\nflying through the air like a metal fucking rock and you and you were in it and your seat\n\n45:23.200 --> 45:30.880\nbeing back or forward to them is a big deal you for instance if you'd like to test this\n\n45:30.880 --> 45:39.800\ntheory try keeping your seat back the whole time they won't let you we all know this we\n\n45:39.800 --> 45:47.360\naccept it your seat has to be forward when you land now sometimes and I find this very\n\n45:47.360 --> 45:55.000\ninteresting sometimes your seat doesn't work now the reason I find this interesting is\n\n45:55.000 --> 46:03.280\nbecause the times your seat doesn't work is because the airline is shitty and the airplane\n\n46:03.280 --> 46:09.040\nisn't working right and it is though time those times not when you need your seat to\n\n46:09.040 --> 46:16.320\nbe back it is it is their failure that immediately solves the problem I find that very interesting\n\n46:16.320 --> 46:21.680\nI feel like she already knows the story she's annoyed by it but I'm like I'm not I'm I find\n\n46:21.680 --> 46:27.480\nthis very interesting I've had this conversation so many times where like my seat my seat is\n\n46:27.480 --> 46:33.920\nlike half back and the person comes by and they go I really need that seat to be up before\n\n46:33.920 --> 46:41.960\nwe land and that could have been a woman or a gay man the the and I go like it doesn't\n\n46:41.960 --> 46:47.120\nI'm hey man you try make it go make it do what you need it to do in order for the plane\n\n46:47.120 --> 46:54.680\nto land and they go oh it doesn't work oh okay fuck it fuck it because it's our fault\n\n46:54.680 --> 47:01.440\nfuck it because the plane doesn't work it's a crisis if it's on you it's fuck it if it's\n\n47:01.440 --> 47:08.080\non them hey I'm sorry we really need that engine to be on the wing well the engine's\n\n47:08.080 --> 47:12.600\nnot on the wing it won't it came disconnected it up in the air the plane is doing a fucking\n\n47:12.600 --> 47:30.600\nbarrel roll toward the soil oh okay well sorry fuck it I hope you live I'm on your side but\n\n47:30.600 --> 47:36.760\nand I get it I get your frustration but that guy coming by he just has to his his big crisis\n\n47:36.760 --> 47:41.120\nis that he wakes up every day and has to tell a bunch of people in an airplane in 2014 to\n\n47:41.120 --> 47:46.280\nnot smoke in an airplane and to do all these things and then he's walk I mean he said fuck\n\n47:46.280 --> 47:51.280\nit because like that's how he feels yeah exactly exactly but what what if you were a secret\n\n47:51.280 --> 47:57.480\nflyer what is that oh a person who knows about these secret flyers like a death's head officer\n\n47:57.480 --> 48:03.560\nthat's attending to be a tourist like my seat can go back you just need to try harder prisoner\n\n48:03.560 --> 48:09.720\nnumber 137 okay I understand your frustration I have a personal connection to this because\n\n48:09.720 --> 48:15.480\nafter this happened I was awaking from a beautiful nap I ever heard the interaction which is fine\n\n48:15.480 --> 48:19.720\nbecause I have similar interactions and then I unfortunately said to you I don't think it was\n\n48:19.720 --> 48:27.720\nthat big of a deal and then I was I was on the other side of the Gaza Strip because the\n\n48:27.720 --> 48:36.840\nGaza Strip is a line on a ping-pong table the other side of the you know you know what I mean\n\n48:36.840 --> 48:42.320\nthe point being and what I said to you is it's of course it's not a big deal that's the tyranny\n\n48:42.320 --> 48:48.280\nof course it's not a big deal there's not no one's gonna of course no one's gonna hit me\n\n48:48.280 --> 48:55.840\non the writing talk about the body body scanning machines how you opt out and I don't I opt out\n\n48:55.840 --> 49:02.960\nthank you the more I said opt out the sooner that those things are fucking taken out of the\n\n49:02.960 --> 49:10.040\nairports you know who doesn't opt out who loves just getting fucked in the anus with an airplane\n\n49:10.040 --> 49:18.200\nwing well it's not knock that that's a lot of fun actually sounds great they're kind of tapered\n\n49:18.200 --> 49:21.760\nat the end and then they get slowly bigger toward the body of the plane there's a lot of\n\n49:21.760 --> 49:28.400\nvariety then there's an engine in the middle of it with like a suction like turbine I'm going\n\n49:28.400 --> 49:35.000\nfrom here to Tarzana California to market the airplane wing build-up when you opt out don't\n\n49:35.000 --> 49:42.280\nyou get like harassed yes exactly you like every time I opt out I get taken to like the\n\n49:42.280 --> 49:52.880\nlittle room or do you say like they test something on your clothes and then they're\n\n49:52.880 --> 49:59.240\nlike oh it's a hair gel that's setting the alarm off we have to take you back for a search you\n\n49:59.240 --> 50:03.160\ngot to stop wearing that maybe this is the Portland airport I think you have to stop being\n\n50:03.160 --> 50:10.920\nan Italian porno's it's had bad luck I don't know I mean a very mixed experience I mean it's\n\n50:10.920 --> 50:15.680\nnot it's not great but I think most people are pretty nice though there are some airports\n\n50:15.680 --> 50:27.360\nwhere they're like you're opting out and then an hour later someone comes over and I'm not\n\n50:27.360 --> 50:32.160\ngoing to disclose what part of the country that was but they've definitely been instructed it's\n\n50:32.160 --> 50:37.240\nit's out they can't keep a secret it's not like it's the fucking though today I had a very nice\n\n50:37.240 --> 50:43.760\nconversation and I you know I become as I've gotten older I've really cherished my female\n\n50:43.760 --> 50:52.840\nfriendships and there is something to staring in the eyes of a strange TSA woman who says to you\n\n50:52.840 --> 51:01.360\nI'm going to take my hands up between your legs until I first several times I did this I got this\n\n51:01.360 --> 51:06.680\nline until I think they corrected it I'm going to take my hands up your thighs until I meet the\n\n51:06.680 --> 51:20.040\nresistance the first time I was like the resistance hiding out in there thank you for\n\n51:20.040 --> 51:24.080\nfighting the good fight until I meet the resistance they're supposed to say resistance\n\n51:24.080 --> 51:28.560\nwhich also I don't like to think of my pussy as resistance I don't want it I don't want to\n\n51:28.560 --> 51:33.580\nthink of it as a portal either but I don't want to think of it as some sort of like force\n\n51:33.580 --> 51:39.720\nfeel it's not like happy cartoon hashtag happy cartoon but today I had a really nice\n\n51:39.720 --> 51:44.360\nconversation with this young woman who is like airports right and I'm like you're telling me\n\n51:44.360 --> 51:50.240\nas she's like touching my boobs and I'm like this is cool that we can have this moment like you\n\n51:50.240 --> 51:57.040\nknow which is used to dance in the forest and I like the idea that your vagina is the resistance\n\n51:57.040 --> 52:03.640\nbecause I like I like that you're I love you for your humanity and I when I think of the\n\n52:03.640 --> 52:14.320\nresistance I think of the TV the TV miniseries event V from the 80s like I think of your vagina\n\n52:14.320 --> 52:19.960\nas like spray painting over propaganda that was put there by aliens and going like fuck it we\n\n52:19.960 --> 52:29.960\ncan fight and I'm like yeah I love awesome I love this vagina it fights you know I mean it\n\n52:29.960 --> 52:35.000\ndoes make you feel like a battleship a little bit or they're like do you have any devices no ma'am\n\n52:35.000 --> 52:42.040\nI do not but I could yeah I could have some some devices that's a thing I'm just learning\n\n52:42.040 --> 52:46.680\nabout this thing you stand before you say anything this is my own expression that I came\n\n52:46.680 --> 52:51.560\nup with it's not like common vernacular no but I want to I think it's it's intuitive yeah\n\n52:51.560 --> 52:58.320\nexactly yeah you know what I mean when I say a kangaroo who hears kangaroo before no no let's\n\n52:58.320 --> 53:03.920\nsay you're going to be dishonest across the country yeah I don't believe that they're just\n\n53:03.920 --> 53:09.120\nlying out there yeah like you guys didn't go to a concert where they're searching for she means\n\n53:09.120 --> 53:15.200\nputting a nickel bag of marijuana in your vagina or or anything that might need to get through\n\n53:15.200 --> 53:21.880\nsome kind of checkpoint you've never no one in Portland has ever used their birth you know it\n\n53:21.880 --> 53:30.680\ntakes a lot to see the nobility in kangarooing I do those you know I don't opt out I go through\n\n53:30.680 --> 53:36.600\nthe back scanner machines and every time I like it's probably psychosomatic but every time I just\n\n53:36.600 --> 53:42.720\nlike my balls hurt afterwards it's like there I could just feel you know all those little guys\n\n53:42.720 --> 53:47.560\ndying I feel I feel lightheaded I always feel lightheaded it's weird it's got to be site like\n\n53:47.560 --> 53:52.080\nthey can't really be happening right it's all but but then again what would make more sense I mean\n\n53:52.080 --> 53:57.240\nwhat if there's anything useful happening in that machine to them then it of course it's like you\n\n53:57.240 --> 54:02.560\ncould feel it I don't know I thought really good about my decision to opt out when early on some\n\n54:02.560 --> 54:09.200\nTSA TSA agent said to me oh you know they took out a 70% of the radiation do you know that they\n\n54:09.200 --> 54:13.520\ntook out 70% and then another guy was like no a hundred percent I was like fucking no no you're\n\n54:13.520 --> 54:18.000\ntalking about it they took they're like oh we should we should really take out this radio they\n\n54:18.000 --> 54:22.120\ncan't take that's not the way that's not the way it works like it's salad dressing like they're\n\n54:22.120 --> 54:29.600\nlike yeah that's the only thing that they got it's in the same way that I fucking resent when I go\n\n54:29.600 --> 54:34.000\nto urban outfitters and I'm trying to return a sweater and someone's like have you worn this like\n\n54:34.000 --> 54:38.520\nwhen I when I haven't and I know I have not worn the sweater I don't know and it's like is your\n\n54:38.520 --> 54:43.160\nlast name urban outfitters I know you're making ten dollars an hour and I'm a human being and\n\n54:43.160 --> 54:46.800\nyou're a human being and guess what's not a human being is urban outfitters fucking take my\n\n54:46.800 --> 54:54.960\nsweater right Asian M is worse and then the same way with the TSA agents when they're like yeah\n\n54:54.960 --> 54:58.840\nyou know they took out the radiation it's like what the what what on your deathbed are you\n\n54:58.840 --> 55:06.360\ngonna say I was a company man but like it's a it's it's a radiation dispenser that's its job\n\n55:06.360 --> 55:11.560\nhow do they take out the radiation no exactly it's just a box I looked it up afterwards and\n\n55:11.560 --> 55:16.840\nit's there's nothing to it one guy one day was right I have ice in my mouth like a there's an\n\n55:16.840 --> 55:21.240\nurban legend or or or it's true but I will say it's an urban legend so I want to spread things\n\n55:21.240 --> 55:27.640\nthat I don't want to be totally irresponsible but there's a you know there's legend has it\n\n55:27.640 --> 55:33.200\nthat the guy that invented that machine won't go through it yeah how many how many people\n\n55:33.200 --> 55:38.840\nyou're you're Portland do you guys opt out when you go to the airport the port port port port\n\n55:38.840 --> 55:43.880\nPortland has a has a beautiful airport don't they I mean they kind of pretty nice they have\n\n55:43.880 --> 55:48.880\ntwo little shops and stuff I opt out because of the philosophy of it because of a big brother\n\n55:48.880 --> 55:54.760\nbullshit of it and but what would you say to somebody that said well what about a metal\n\n55:54.760 --> 55:59.640\ndetector I mean just because we had no that's fine but I mean with the rule exactly I mean\n\n55:59.640 --> 56:06.640\nwith the I don't know I I'm going to I'm not the I'm not the voice of this cause but the\n\n56:08.040 --> 56:14.760\nthe idea of I mean those body scanner machines really don't detect that much and if someone\n\n56:14.760 --> 56:19.880\nis really trying to smuggle something they can it just seems to me that they're developing\n\n56:19.880 --> 56:25.560\ntechnologies so they can take pictures of us all the time and so they can just ease shit in I\n\n56:25.560 --> 56:29.840\ndon't know it's a little conspiracy theories of me but also I'm like fuck you I just paid\n\n56:29.840 --> 56:33.600\nfive hundred dollars per flight and I have to stand with my arms out and there are pictures\n\n56:33.600 --> 56:38.280\nof what it looks like on another screen and then I don't know it just bugs me and also\n\n56:38.280 --> 56:42.400\nnot everybody has to do it it goes back and forth and it's like well then what is the\n\n56:42.400 --> 56:47.680\npoint of this it's just a it's just like a slow control thing like TSA was born and so\n\n56:47.680 --> 56:54.360\nthey came up with this fucking thing I hope they can fly on I hope that H&M and Banana\n\n56:54.360 --> 56:57.320\nRepublic or whoever you were talking about don't maybe the next podcast Aaron will just\n\n56:57.320 --> 57:02.600\nbe naked she's being boycotted by all the clothes they come to the house and take all my clothes\n\n57:02.600 --> 57:09.600\nthe god damn it there was a there was a McKenna how are you doing over there I'm good yeah\n\n57:10.960 --> 57:17.280\nwell how's your nightmare of being reliving all my airport experiences right now yeah not to\n\n57:17.280 --> 57:22.520\nharp on this topic but like like like look find this on YouTube there's an amazing uplifting\n\n57:22.520 --> 57:29.080\nvideo of these two kids who were handing out opt out flyers at an airport and it's like a it's\n\n57:29.080 --> 57:34.200\nnot a short attention span thing like it's like a 40 minute video but you can like click\n\n57:34.200 --> 57:39.280\nthrough it like the the it's just these two kids are at an airport and they're standing\n\n57:39.280 --> 57:43.720\nat the top of the escalators before in the public area before you go through the machines\n\n57:43.720 --> 57:48.600\nand they're handing out flyers to raise awareness of like opt out day or something like that\n\n57:48.600 --> 57:53.080\nlike you don't have to go through these machines if you don't want to and and the airport\n\n57:53.080 --> 57:57.440\nofficials come up to them they're videotaping it and they start trying to bounce them and\n\n57:57.440 --> 58:01.120\nlike they're using all the official language and you can't be here you can't be doing this\n\n58:01.120 --> 58:06.280\nyou can't be distributing this literature and but and they bother to say I think we\n\n58:06.280 --> 58:10.440\ncan I think we can stand here and talk to people and hand them literature we're in an\n\n58:10.440 --> 58:14.800\nairport you have people down there doing the same thing for some religion we were just\n\n58:14.800 --> 58:19.960\ndoing the same thing and then they get increasingly aggressive and then they call the cops and\n\n58:19.960 --> 58:25.640\nthis cop not an airport cop just a regular cop has to come and the regular cop is just\n\n58:25.640 --> 58:30.240\nthis guy who refreshingly like he's kind of he's got the buzz cut and the gun belt and\n\n58:30.240 --> 58:34.360\nhe just looks like any other cop that might do any horrible thing but he like kind of\n\n58:34.360 --> 58:38.640\nscratches his head and he walks away with the airport guy and he's like comes back to the\n\n58:38.640 --> 58:45.480\npeople and he's like yeah I don't know I think the Constitution says you can do whatever\n\n58:45.480 --> 58:51.960\nyou want they gave me a gun and a walkie-talkie I'm supposed to I think I'm supposed to just\n\n58:51.960 --> 58:56.440\nkeep people safe I don't think I'm supposed to I think you're I think you have to and\n\n58:56.440 --> 59:00.320\nthe airport guy is like what the fuck what's your fucking name I'm an airport guy I want\n\n59:00.320 --> 59:05.600\nan airport guy the same as when you try to return a sweater at Urban Outletters it's\n\n59:05.600 --> 59:11.080\nidentical and I'm saying this I feel strongly about this because I worked at Urban Outletters\n\n59:11.080 --> 59:19.240\nand at Hot Topic yeah yeah really dark times but at Hot Topic the clothes are so cheap\n\n59:19.240 --> 59:24.200\nand I would have colleagues that would be like I don't know should we take this back\n\n59:24.200 --> 59:29.560\nshould we should we accept it and I'm like yeah what

makes you feel like you're in church it's that machine it's that\n\n59:38.520 --> 59:41.680\nmachine in back it just makes you think of flashnets and how women have been exploited\n\n59:41.680 -->

it\n\n01:02:21.760 --> 01:02:27.920\nwas cold it was cold what's utilitarian about the beard it's really cold there because Alaska\n\n01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:34.520\nI was in I was in my hotel that's also as cold as Alaska and I was I was shirtless and I\n\n01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:40.080\nwas trying to sleep and when I had my beard on my chest I was fine and when I swept it\n\n01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:45.480\nto the side I was freezing cold it's like an afghan for your neck it's like a blanket\n\n01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:50.980\nfrom your face and I heard in for the people in Ferguson are reporting it's a natural tear\n\n01:02:50.980 --> 01:02:58.360\ngas filter oh definitely just put it over your eyes yeah that it works it's just an adaptation\n\n01:02:58.360 --> 01:03:03.440\nwe're all making it anyway I'll make this super brief I don't make you don't have to\n\n01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:09.240\nmake it brief yeah don't worry about it this isn't desperate housewives it's a fuckin\n\n01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:15.920\nPortland podcast we want to hear your human stories I moved and had some really close\n\n01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:21.320\nfriends I did podcast with and we were you know made a lot of stuff together and we were\n\n01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:25.920\ncontinuing to do it like kind of long distance because I was the only one who moved because\n\n01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:31.800\nI had to get out because it's the middle of nowhere yeah it yeah Alaska it's Cincinnati\n\n01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:40.840\nin the north no offense to Cincinnati they make wonderful chili the so I moved and and\n\n01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:45.120\nthen came back in like May like six months later for the first time just for a weekend\n\n01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:49.440\nand we hung out and everything was great and then there was huge social drama because it\n\n01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:58.600\nturned out I had anchorage is a small town I had thrown your anchor into a seat I had\n\n01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:05.840\nI found anchorage I guess you could say in a port that ended up being all that's a really\n\n01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:10.800\nbad way to talk about a human being I'm taking that back immediately feel like we should\n\n01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:17.760\ncommit to the party we all know women are at port we did like a major plot point and\n\n01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:24.800\nthen you guys got derailed with this it was a short-term mortgage and then more it was\n\n01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:31.480\nvery friendly and was very amicable and you know we were we were friends and then she\n\n01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:37.080\nstarted dating another friend in the close friend group and things kind of spiraled from\n\n01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:40.600\nthere but it was the first time that like really close friends were kind of like alright\n\n01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:46.520\nno we're done so because did you become the the this is the thing that drives me insane\n\n01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:51.440\nabout romance the the dirt underbelly of it that we see this is why I don't like romantic\n\n01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:59.480\ncomedies but but because Aaron and Aaron loves them but I I I'm projecting like like I think\n\n01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:03.320\nthat drives me insane my worst nightmare is being cast as the villain and someone else's\n\n01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:07.640\nstory even though I didn't it's just like oh that's convenient for you like I'm the\n\n01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:13.320\nwind beneath your fucking wings because it's like taboo and not only was I the villain\n\n01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:19.720\nI was sour on on the proverbial mountain literally a country away you know like you\n\n01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:24.560\nhad to go through Canada which is like I don't know Dwarf's live there or something and then\n\n01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:29.320\nthere was me you know being all villainy and so you became a were you were you the other\n\n01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:33.280\nman ever no not at all this was before they got together but there were there were friends\n\n01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:38.320\nyeah yeah no one thinks about Alaska anyway for like and it's not too big a deal because\n\n01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:42.920\nyeah I don't need to go back I'm good for now like well I'll say you're you're an emotional\n\n01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:47.720\npain you lost all your friends in a couple of days like you went from five to zero or\n\n01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:54.320\nwhatever it is I don't mean to presume the numbers I would start with three but but but\n\n01:05:54.320 --> 01:06:00.560\nlike he needs to hear more than fuck those friends you're right my mom always used to\n\n01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:05.360\nsay when I would I would go out and I would get beat up by people and then I would come\n\n01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:10.320\nhome and I would go Scott and so and so beat me up and my mom would go well so now you\n\n01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:14.640\nknow you don't like those guys right you know like and here they are wanting to beat you\n\n01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:19.360\nup so some problems solve themselves and you have to see them every day like that and\n\n01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:23.560\nthat's the part that's still raw is because of the internet which is a great thing in\n\n01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:30.880\nso many ways were just kind of one Kevin Bacon away from each other yeah you know and have\n\n01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:35.120\na whole bunch of mutual friends so like it's there's only so much hiding and blocking\n\n01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:39.480\nand muting that you can do did they break break up with you via like an email or some kind\n\n01:06:39.480 --> 01:06:44.120\nof conversation no it was like hey I'm back in town for three days three days everything's\n\n01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:50.560\ncool one day the next day oh by the way podcast listeners it was right he's flipping off you\n\n01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:56.000\ngive him double birds without really knowing the situation I would I would say to not really\n\n01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:00.680\ntake that too personally if you really believe that you weren't in the wrong yeah don't worry\n\n01:07:00.680 --> 01:07:07.120\nabout it you've moved so it's not really about you it's like they're they're like look who's\n\n01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:11.960\nin the Anchorage crew well it sounds like they're resentful that you've got out right I mean\n\n01:07:11.960 --> 01:07:17.540\nright maybe I'd imagine that it sucks for agreement all that I mean am I hearing a different\n\n01:07:17.540 --> 01:07:21.200\nthing I mean he doesn't he's not he's not wondering whether or not he should like these\n\n01:07:21.200 --> 01:07:27.640\npeople he is saying it hurt you know it like is a wound that it's like Allen and it's just\n\n01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:32.160\nsitting there so what's the staff that you put on it it won't heal it the thing that\n\n01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:37.800\nwill heal it is his own body and time but is there like some some Neosporin that we could\n\n01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:42.800\nsquirt on it in the morning reminding myself if I was in his position reminding myself\n\n01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:46.920\nthat it wasn't really about me it would be that Neosporin which is why I said that right\n\n01:07:46.920 --> 01:07:50.960\ndefinitely I wasn't and I my god I wasn't arguing with you oh Jesus you guys shouldn't\n\n01:07:50.960 --> 01:07:59.160\nbe therapists at all if there's a couple therapists important practice called mixed nuts I mean\n\n01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:03.520\nI think the first thing we need to do not to be Geraldo Rivera about it but I gotta reach\n\n01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:08.560\naround I'm like Kelly McGillis and Top Gun and just embrace him and you can't see it\n\n01:08:08.560 --> 01:08:13.920\non the podcast it's not it's not for it's not for applause but thank you how does it\n\n01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:22.880\nfeel to be to be touched and held by someone you admire who will never betray you I don't\n\n01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:32.840\ncare I don't care who you who you date next I'm never gonna touch her I'm every time you\n\n01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:40.520\nhear my voice I'm talking to you praise Jesus I'm very sorry that happened to you and these\n\n01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:45.320\nmoments of pain I like to quote one of my favorite shows a little time my so-called\n\n01:08:45.320 --> 01:08:54.600\nlife I would reference an episode halfway through the series where Claire is getting\n\n01:08:54.600 --> 01:09:00.800\nover Jordan and realizes that she's over him and she says you know what it hurts until\n\n01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:09.120\nit doesn't it hurts until it doesn't that's still that just seems like such a fuck off\n\n01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:14.320\nlike no it's not it's not a fuck I mean the the meaning that is like no like if you feel\n\n01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:17.400\nsad about this your feelings are valid and you're gonna sit in them but you won't feel\n\n01:09:17.400 --> 01:09:25.640\nthat way forever it'll it'll expire it hurts until it doesn't what if it hurts forever\n\n01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:28.240\nwell then there's something wrong with you and you should jump off and then you die and\n\n01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:33.440\nit doesn't hurt anymore what if you know that it makes me feel a lot better you just die\n\n01:09:33.440 --> 01:09:38.920\nand you're fine what if you're so smart what if you're so smart then it's not about that\n\n01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:43.400\nsituation what if you're so smart that you know that about pain and it doesn't change\n\n01:09:43.400 --> 01:09:48.760\nanything what if what if what if what do you do in those moments when knowing how your\n\n01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:52.600\nbrain works and how your heart works doesn't change anything that's going on in them what\n\n01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:57.880\ndo you what do you is there is there a technique is there a you go you go inside you gotta you\n\n01:09:57.880 --> 01:10:03.200\ngotta go inside get out of the sun get out of orange Hitler your emotions are a lot like\n\n01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:07.200\nweather they come and go and sometimes they make sense and follow patterns and other times\n\n01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:12.720\nit's like a freak storm it's like you go inside or you had a friend who suggested he\n\n01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:17.800\ngot over a breakup he watched all the seasons of Farscape oh that sounds awesome I mean\n\n01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:22.800\nthe thing is it's it's not a that's the thing is that like it's it's a tired expression\n\n01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:30.160\nbut it's in a dumb old adage but time really does heal all wounds the good news about being\n\n01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:36.800\nsad is that in times when you're sad art is better music is better probably more creative\n\n01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:41.560\nyou're seeing things differently like you're really living because you have you're bleeding\n\n01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:46.120\nfrom your soul as you're walking around like that's a good news but news is again it's\n\n01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:50.760\ngonna feel bad until it doesn't feel bad anymore that's just that's just time what\n\n01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:57.720\na bad thing to do is to try to fix it by a fucking you know doing like putting a building\n\n01:10:57.720 --> 01:11:02.360\na windmill or whatever crazy thing you would do talking about it on a podcast in front\n\n01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:05.760\nof yeah well I don't I don't think Seth's the type of guy that's gonna do anything he's\n\n01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:12.080\ngonna I mean by the way what you have he's gonna do great things no I said I was saying\n\n01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:16.160\nI don't think he's gonna do anything that's like unhealthy with pain if he's willing to\n\n01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:20.800\nlike cry it out from an audience at a podcast that means he's already actually like he's\n\n01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:26.760\ngot oxygen and that's gonna heal but Seth do you do you ever listen to this podcast\n\n01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:30.720\ndo you think it would help you heal a little bit to play a character that you whose life\n\n01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:37.160\nyou had more control over in a game of Dungeons and Dragons maybe whose wounds could not hurt\n\n01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:45.680\nyou no matter who did anything to you so do you think I don't know how we got a smattering\n\n01:11:45.680 --> 01:11:49.680\nof applause when we asked who listened to the podcast so but

mic I don't eat the\n\n01:14:39.720 --> 01:14:44.520\nwarlock for a while right now I'm a paladin so I got you know that's exciting Gilman\n\n01:14:44.520 --> 01:14:50.400\nthe Toronto yeah it's kind of getting old no it sounds great David Cross as a family\n\n01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:55.720\nman can we let's reenact the encounter so like imagine a black and white strobing thing\n\n01:14:55.720 --> 01:15:01.720\nlike from a crime show yeah like okay we're we're we're look alike actors so like David\n\n01:15:01.720 --> 01:15:08.440\ndo companies playing me and so I'm just let's just reenact okay I'm by the cooler okay Dan\n\n01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:13.120\nthis is the only time this is going to happen but I have to do it now okay so David Cross\n\n01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:18.120\nis a put-upon family man and a super scientist he works at the Enlightenment Corporation\n\n01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:22.040\nand tests the Bodhisattva chair an electric chair that blasts people into enlightenment\n\n01:15:22.040 --> 01:15:26.240\nfor science father of three his wife Jane keeps things kosher at home while wielding\n\n01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:33.240\na gigantic hook for a hand

01:15:46.640\nknow David Cross will we'll get that to him but I don't think he makes those decisions\n\n01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:49.560\nI think David Cross probably has an agent he's like does anyone want to hire me and\n\n01:15:49.560 --> 01:15:56.240\nthen they go like oh the guy wants you to play a robot all right so you got the character\n\n01:15:56.240 --> 01:16:04.840\nsheets ready yeah let

it'll really do you want\n\n01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:54.240\nto hum it I think that would be better actually when we last met our heroes had landed in\n\n01:16:54.240 --> 01:17:01.200\nsome pretty hot water after a late night juice tour gonna ride the party retired with Spis\n\n01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:06.560\nBulb the friendly gnome where they decided to break into the priest's juicery to look\n\n01:17:06.560 --> 01:17:13.200\nfor clues don't become while inside the juicery the gang heard a noise and arrived to see a\n\n01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:19.160\nbeaten father tinder and escaping assailant Sharpie tracked down the would-be murderer\n\n01:17:19.160 --> 01:17:26.160\nto the Darvon household and what he found wasn't pretty Darvon and her son were murdered\n\n01:17:26.160 --> 01:17:34.240\ndead home there Sharpie and the gang encountered the assassin Spis Bulb the gnome the little\n\n01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:39.360\ngnome cast powerful nap magics and hurled insults but something wasn't light right\n\n01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:45.560\nbone blows were exchanged but using his shrewd mind Christopher determined that Spis Bulb\n\n01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:52.200\nwasn't at posture convincing their cast attacker to cast off his disguise revealing himself\n\n01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:59.440\nto be none other than father tinder himself working together the gang started to gain\n\n01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:03.800\nthe upper hand breaking through his shield while quarks slash tinder's head with a flaming\n\n01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:10.040\nsword as the old man like dying white be white beams of light began streaming through the\n\n01:18:10.040 --> 01:18:15.680\nroom as the shard of power worked its ancient and hideous magic but what danger could the\n\n01:18:15.680 --> 01:18:26.960\nshark portend what new evils must the gang face what tricks were still in the way up\n\n01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:42.160\nfather tinder's sleeve find out now that was some great humming I want to buy that album\n\n01:18:42.160 --> 01:18:47.480\nI assume the effect is the same as in the shower but it sounded awesome to me I think\n\n01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:53.400\nwhen we listen to the podcast will be like oh my god stop groaning into the microphone\n\n01:18:53.400 --> 01:18:59.600\nso traditionally you guys have a lot of questions at this point I was humming yeah I was listening\n\n01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:06.200\nI was humming that's what I'm saying so just in a moment where am I standing you guys are\n\n01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:11.640\nall standing together in the broken remnants of the Darvon household you see crumbling stone\n\n01:19:11.640 --> 01:19:17.520\nfalling from the ceiling and all the furniture in the room is destroyed reduced to splinters\n\n01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:23.160\neverything is very hard to see because white light is dazzling you going throughout the\n\n01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:30.000\nroom before it concentrates onto a single glowing humanoid form the form of father tinder he\n\n01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:37.360\nstarts to transform before you into an eight feet tall gray skinned stone skinned bullhorned\n\n01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:44.720\nman with glowing red eyes powerful muscular limbs and stony wings a burning white flame\n\n01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:53.360\ngrows brightly in his chest and he looks not unlike a winged demon or something hi\n\n01:19:53.360 --> 01:20:00.840\ndo you have more questions we're probably cool now right now that he's transformed into\n\n01:20:00.840 --> 01:20:07.040\nthis thing are you asking me or are you asking him I'm kind of thinking out loud okay continue\n\n01:20:07.040 --> 01:20:19.040\nand I've I've worked for him for many a moon and a sunset for sunset 20 moon who are you\n\n01:20:19.040 --> 01:20:27.440\nI'm father tinder I have transformed into my final form like that lady at the drive-through\n\n01:20:27.440 --> 01:20:36.760\nin the video yeah but I'm getting all the chicken nuggets is your now that you've transformed\n\n01:20:36.760 --> 01:20:41.160\ninto your final form you're probably really self-actualized and all your aggression is\n\n01:20:41.160 --> 01:20:49.640\ngone right you could say that yes but I'll still need to destroy you can I mean we could\n\n01:20:49.640 --> 01:20:59.440\ntalk about that we could while I'm destroying you all right I'm gonna run I'd like to run\n\n01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:06.800\nwhat do you guys we're standing there and this guy turned into a demon and he's gonna\n\n01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:13.200\nkill us do you guys

throw\n\n01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:21.800\na sword or something okay well I mean this isn't my first rodeo but do you really want\n\n01:21:21.800 --> 01:21:29.280\nto throw your swords it's more of a Castlevania type you know there's there's a lot of platformers\n\n01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:33.480\nfrom the old days barbarian not thinking things through very well it's good characterization\n\n01:21:33.480 --> 01:21:37.640\nall right I'm bolstered by your confidence you think this is as easy as a boss battle\n\n01:21:37.640 --> 01:21:48.120\nin a video game well I'll attack his milky white spot all right I I'm not a D&D player\n\n01:21:48.120 --> 01:21:55.440\nbut in my gear I have a dragon dick so yeah I feel like that might work in this situation\n\n01:21:55.440 --> 01:22:01.240\nit's more of a trophy I mean I think I think I remember where you got that I don't know\n\n01:22:01.240 --> 01:22:08.360\nif it's a weapon it's something that it's a conversation piece most things are a weapon\n\n01:22:08.360 --> 01:22:16.000\nagainst a milky white spot whose turn is it first I guess I want to put it at a quark's\n\n01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:21.600\nturn how about that's Seth there oh Seth okay well let's go ahead and use a power attack\n\n01:22:21.600 --> 01:22:27.080\nall right that's going to be less accurate than a normal attack I'm afraid and yet you\n\n01:22:27.080 --> 01:22:39.480\nhit him dropping anchor rushing towards your demonic foe you plunge your sword deep into\n\n01:22:39.480 --> 01:22:50.720\nhis side dealing 12 damage and that's not even the milky white spot sure I'm excited\n\n01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:56.600\nyeah we're having a great time we can do this yeah we are doing this yeah we're it's gone\n\n01:22:56.600 -->

quite a quite a lot yeah no I don't even I don't know half\n\n01:23:35.480 --> 01:23:46.840\nof this all right I'm gonna attempt to use a short bow no no you're gonna use I'm going\n\n01:23:46.840 --> 01:23:55.400\nto I'm gonna fucking shoot that short bow in I'm shooting it into the milky white spot\n\n01:23:55.400 --> 01:24:04.520\nyes yes firing an arrow at his milky white spot it was probably it might have been your\n\n01:24:04.520 --> 01:24:12.600\nincome your what is the lack of confidence lack of confidence or something but your arrow\n\n01:24:12.600 --> 01:24:19.160\nmisses its mark plunging deep into the cobblestone walls of the dwelling it's okay he knows\n\n01:24:19.160 --> 01:24:27.640\nwe mean business yeah the communication shot so let's put it at a dignity that's Aaron\n\n01:24:27.640 --> 01:24:44.280\nall right uh foe uh yeah unworthy foe who has been deceitful and untrue going to throw\n\n01:24:44.280 --> 01:24:50.040\nmy axe and it's going to be the death of you I rhyme now I guess I rhyme now so I throw\n\n01:24:50.040 --> 01:24:59.880\nmy I'm gonna throw my axe and I throw it really hard at the middle of his face you do that\n\n01:24:59.880 --> 01:25:04.920\nbut it doesn't hit him in the middle of his face but instead in his shoulder dealing\n\n01:25:04.920 --> 01:25:16.520\nwell what's your strength this plus three eight damage all right yeah the axe protrudes\n\n01:25:16.520 --> 01:25:24.200\nfrom his shoulder it's not a joke I'd like to shoot a fireball at his milky white spot\n\n01:25:25.720 --> 01:25:30.360\nall right casting your arms in a magical manner you unleash a fireball directly\n\n01:25:30.360 --> 01:25:35.560\ntowards his milky white spot he attempts to dodge out of the way but is too sluggish\n\n01:25:35.560 --> 01:25:39.960\nand it hits him right in the chest but not his milky white spot like the nipple right next to\n\n01:25:39.960 --> 01:25:49.240\nit instead but a nice grouping as they say in darts very tinky d&d is I guess there are dragon\n\n01:25:49.240 --> 01:25:57.640\ndicks and milky white semen all this stuff there was no semen but now there is Portland\n\n01:25:57.640 --> 01:26:06.200\nmost strip clubs in the world right per capita love hearing about it most vegan strip clubs is that\n\n01:26:06.200 --> 01:26:19.880\nwhat you said we'll talk after dealing 17 damage all right all right and that's just the nipple\n\n01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:28.520\nI shout out the milky white spot it's the way to go so he turns his eyes to you the wizard\n\n01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:33.960\nwho's casted all this magic sand he beats his powerful wings and lunges at you through the\n\n01:26:33.960 --> 01:26:41.560\nair his claws outstretched reaching right towards your neck that's my milky white spot\n\n01:26:41.560 --> 01:26:50.040\nbut he grabs you by the throat dealing nine damage and holding you fast in his sharp rocky\n\n01:26:50.040 --> 01:26:57.480\nclaw all right can I is it possible for me to go out of turn and use diplomacy no afraid not\n\n01:26:58.120 --> 01:27:06.120\nbut you could do it in your own turn thank you which is only three turns away putting it at\n\n01:27:06.120 --> 01:27:21.640\nSeth's turn I appear to have some yarn you sure do I just thought it's funny because it's right\n\n01:27:21.640 --> 01:27:28.680\nnext to the nut sack I thought he got rid of that nut sack it is it has not yet been combined\n\n01:27:28.680 --> 01:27:36.440\nwith the dragon dick take a moment and say how much joy it is for me to hear that quirk is about\n\n01:27:36.440 -->
