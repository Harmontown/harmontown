00:59.720 --> 01:03.880
be on it I don't know I don't know what happened I don't think anyone cares we're

01:03.880 --> 01:10.080
gonna we're innovating yeah matter two mics up here there's warehouses full of homemade

01:10.080 --> 01:17.600
video games by a bunch of hippies and anarchists it's about independent thought and not having

01:17.600 --> 01:23.960
that be automatically synonymous with growing your own basil you can also you can also have

01:23.960 --> 01:28.320
a computer involved and think independently which I think is a very important thing you

01:28.320 --> 01:33.080
can automate your basil garden by a laptop now you now you're making me miss Minecraft

01:33.080 --> 01:41.240
I Spencer and I are both into a headlong into a Minecraft addiction that I don't think either

01:41.240 --> 01:46.000
of us has acknowledged is like an actual movie of the week heroin type of addiction it's

01:46.000 --> 01:51.320
really like I've done a lot of things obsessively and compulsively in my life but Minecraft

01:51.320 --> 01:58.080
Jesus Christ it's like masturbating with heroin or something like coding your hand in heroin

01:58.080 --> 02:03.480
that's how you do it right rubbing it on your penis yeah and like but the your penis

02:03.480 --> 02:09.120
is a special heroin penis that has heroin receptacles on it well it's like well my hand

02:09.120 --> 02:15.320
is made of syringes you see I was thinking about that but then that's that turns you

02:15.320 --> 02:20.760
off well it turns me on maybe they're like they're syringes but the needles are like

02:20.760 --> 02:28.120
those rubber like kind of like dog toy little sea anemone things they just make it grip

02:28.120 --> 02:36.000
and I was trying to get away from the Freddy Krueger I mean I thought that was more pleasant

02:36.000 --> 02:42.160
than whatever you were just describing to be honest well yeah any description of anything

02:42.160 --> 02:51.960
pointy going near your penis if it's on me for going deep anyways hello Portland we are

02:51.960 --> 03:00.000
good to meet you yeah this is my second time at XOXO different stage I wasn't here last

03:00.000 --> 03:06.880
year I was busy probably being fired or something but I love Portland and I love XOXO I think

03:06.880 --> 03:12.120
XOXO might be the first time I was at Portland it was the first one two years ago and now

03:12.120 --> 03:20.680
it's exploded as we hoped it might and you know we're here in a I think you would call

03:20.680 --> 03:24.160
it a steel mill I don't know technically what it is does anyone know what this building

03:24.160 --> 03:31.520
was used for a metal stamping factory factory is the word but it's a big it's a big grown-up

03:31.520 --> 03:39.320
building it's a building for pre-industrial pre-war real things got done yeah we're our

03:39.320 --> 03:44.680
dad's we're our mythical ghosts of our dad's works there's boots in the back there's there's

03:44.680 --> 03:51.600
shelves that were that are only there to hold stuff with no no no no no thought lent to

03:51.600 --> 03:58.960
aesthetic therefore now it's hip it's we have a blue collar chic we're in a vast canyon

03:58.960 --> 04:03.440
I if anyone here is over 40 you're you're in this place and maybe you have all kinds

04:03.440 --> 04:10.280
of different connotations but all I can think about is Jennifer Beals I'm gonna have to

04:10.280 --> 04:16.640
explain that to me well yeah you're 20 you're 12 years old what are you I'm 13 in December

04:16.640 --> 04:25.480
13 and life you got it's 13 and life you go you'll crime is time and you just got your

04:25.480 --> 04:34.120
baby teeth out there's there was a movie called flash dance and I actually have haven't seen

04:34.120 --> 04:40.280
it but most people my age saw it because it was like in the water like fluoride like we

04:40.280 --> 04:43.960
all know that there was a movie called flash dance if you're over if you're my age then

04:43.960 --> 04:48.200
you know there was this movie called flash dance and you know that in that movie a woman

04:48.200 --> 04:54.020
is a dancer and a welder and you know that she dances and then pulls a chain and then

04:54.020 --> 04:58.400
water pulls down full splashes down her and you know there's a steel mill involved you

04:58.400 --> 05:03.880
know that roughly the same things about footloose does she weld wild dancing the steel mill

05:03.880 --> 05:08.760
became big in the 80s it was like a big it was a place you went to dance at the steel

05:08.760 --> 05:14.480
mill until Robo cop finally put a quirk in that said no this is a place you go to fucking

05:14.480 --> 05:24.000
learn to be a robot again I gotta reach recalibrate my baby food shooters how are your baby food

05:24.000 --> 05:30.200
shooters by the way why is that a euphemism yeah for your for your heroin dick with its

05:30.200 --> 05:36.600
dog toys spines it's you know full of holes but good ones in a good way heroin all their

05:36.600 --> 05:42.360
track marks really they got oculus riffs here they got I didn't go to the arcade yet they

05:42.360 --> 05:46.400
got a they got an independent arcade here they make independent games which are always

05:46.400 --> 05:52.080
so awesome because it's like back to the basics do they take quarters no not like that that's

05:52.080 --> 05:58.920
the bad part even more indie than quarters yeah they're almost indy of all change you

05:58.920 --> 06:03.640
know as we as we progress as a society we find new ways to make computers think more

06:03.640 --> 06:09.480
things faster and all too often we then funnel that all into graphics cards and go like how

06:09.480 --> 06:14.600
can I keep this you know okay the fan can cool off this much processor this for this

06:14.600 --> 06:20.320
amount of time so how how many how many angles how many triangles can we generate talking

06:20.320 --> 06:25.080
about minecraft again well I'm indirectly I am yes because I think the other way is

06:25.080 --> 06:30.440
to go like okay no computers can do more now so let's like actually if it looks like pac-man

06:30.440 --> 06:36.760
you can have pac-man do more shit like he could eat way more than a key we thought that was

06:36.760 --> 06:42.040
the most pac-man could ever eat was a key I never got past cherries if I'm honest yeah

06:42.040 --> 06:50.160
you got to get to the key bro cheese I don't know what were you level is the key on it's

06:50.160 --> 06:57.600
like the maximum level you can't eat anything past a key and it makes sense why would you

06:57.600 --> 07:04.360
that's words to live by right there you can't eat a key all right so here we are in Portland

07:04.360 --> 07:13.560
where my fiancee and I keep thinking we want to move to and I keep I imagine that there

07:13.560 --> 07:18.760
was a okay there was you know there was you heard that a couple of people are into the

07:18.760 --> 07:23.840
idea exactly there there's I think there's a lot of people probably going don't move

07:23.840 --> 07:29.840
to Portland you fucking asshole not because not because of me but just because everyone

07:29.840 --> 07:34.920
stopped moving to Portland maybe I don't know how you guys feel about that do you want everyone

07:34.920 --> 07:40.720
to move to Portland some people do that's only some though I mean maybe they're new

07:40.720 --> 07:51.280
to Portland they're in the back because they just got here everyone else hates us good

07:51.280 --> 07:57.720
time yeah I don't know I was I'm also fascinated with the the overcast weather thing because

07:57.720 --> 08:03.480
I love it people in Portland are so apologetic for it and people from LA they go no you don't

08:03.480 --> 08:10.040
understand I don't care I hate the sun the sun is is it you you want to kick it in the

08:10.040 --> 08:16.480
sun balls yeah I said that earlier on this fucking I came to Portland I was looking forward

08:16.480 --> 08:23.440
to hiding from this fucking yellow maniac this this fucking orange Hitler this this

08:23.440 --> 08:30.840
this spherical fucking Ayatollah like lording over everything demanding everything of you

08:30.840 --> 08:35.400
reflecting everything I think in Portland I think I feel like their sidewalks are more

08:35.400 --> 08:40.400
reflective because they miss the sun so much that they're like it'll be here one day and

08:40.400 --> 08:45.040
when it's here there'll be a parade but like you come from LA and you're like why are you

08:45.040 --> 08:50.680
trying to simulate the fucking godless desert that I came here from I just I want the gray

08:50.680 --> 08:57.680
skies and the shade and the the the dark boozy cloisters the independent video games the

08:57.680 --> 09:06.280
yogurt is you know there's no you guys they're not they don't they don't like yogurt here

09:06.280 --> 09:13.400
I might I might have got a mixed up with Seattle I don't know home of the yogurt someone told

09:13.400 --> 09:19.920
me backstage that they like yogurt here's here's one guy here likes yogurt here's something

09:19.920 --> 09:23.760
else a guy told me backstage this is a little weird and I don't want this guy to kill himself

09:23.760 --> 09:30.120
and be telling the story but we admire him I want this guy is fine he should not be ashamed

09:30.120 --> 09:34.920
of himself but he should also understand that as I think he understood when he did this

09:34.920 --> 09:40.520
that this is that he is the first person that has ever done this and I thought it was notable

09:40.520 --> 09:49.280
I was I was in the back hunched over a cooler getting my contractually required bottle of

09:49.280 --> 09:55.400
kettle one out of a few bags of ice and there's five people run back there and it's goodbye

09:55.400 --> 10:06.000
evening the but I was I was pouring a drink and this guy came back and he I'll do an impression

10:06.000 --> 10:11.400
of him and I please sir wherever you are don't feel bad about yourself but I have to share

10:11.400 --> 10:16.280
this it's just interesting you did this to me I get to do it to everyone I get to turn

10:16.280 --> 10:24.080
it into something you're part of something a guy he came up and he said Dan Harmon and

10:24.080 --> 10:31.640
I said yes and he said look I he kind of he said something very quickly along the lines

10:31.640 --> 10:36.240
of like you know my friends told me not to do this and I thought maybe I should do it

10:36.240 --> 10:45.440
but here we go and he was like oh my god this is how John Lennon died but he pulled out

10:45.440 --> 10:51.240
a phone and I was like oh he wants a picture I'm a very handsome person I approve of this

10:51.240 --> 10:56.280
but then he opened the phone and then he just opened it up and he went like I'm gonna make

10:56.280 --> 10:59.560
I'm gonna make this up because I think this kind of person like values the intellectual

10:59.560 --> 11:03.600
property he was reading so I'll make a new thing up but he's like Alan Alda plays a

11:03.600 --> 11:07.200
Midwestern man who's transported to a different dimension of a single and he just rattled

11:07.200 --> 11:12.440
off he just he just he just read a pitch off of his phone he just read it off of his phone

11:12.440 --> 11:18.080
that's so much guts though I could never do anything close to that why because of your

11:18.080 --> 11:26.080
conscience yeah yeah what what horrible wall is between you and that brave act

11:26.080 --> 11:38.000
empathy I mean empathy is what it is not a wall it is an invitation empathy it's not

11:38.000 --> 11:46.480
a wall it's not a wall that keeps you from being a sociopath it's not like video games

11:46.480 --> 11:53.720
where there's a thing you can't do so you just fucking try to do it the walls in society

11:53.720 --> 12:05.880
are there sometimes because very brave though very brave very bright murder arguably right

12:05.880 --> 12:13.200
no one denies that murderous other brave people throughout society Hitler Abe Lincoln Hitler

12:13.200 --> 12:22.480
John Wayne Gacy Jeffrey Dahmer Taylor Swift Taylor Swift Kanye West Kanye West running

12:22.480 --> 12:29.800
up and saying Taylor Swift give me that microphone fuck you it was brave and yes bravery is a

12:29.800 --> 12:38.200
moral descriptor agreed it has nothing to do with good or bad there are brave Ted Bundy's

12:38.200 --> 12:43.960
there are brave George Washington's there are brave Japanese senators there are brave

12:43.960 --> 12:59.320
Ku Klux Klan dragons it is brave to fuck with people it's terrible but brave it's an interesting

12:59.320 --> 13:08.360
I meet some brave people so did John Lennon John Lennon went out meeting one of the bravest

13:08.360 --> 13:18.520
people he will ever meet so forgive me for not putting a high value on bravery I'm not

13:18.520 --> 13:24.680
putting a high value in my old age notable as I travel the country I start to put something

13:24.680 --> 13:30.800
like you know tacked higher than bravery that's me that's my self interest I'm like oh that's

13:30.800 --> 13:36.960
a tactful man I appreciate him more maybe I'll conflagrate them and then go like you

13:36.960 --> 13:45.720
know what it's brave to be that tactful tax is brave no it's not tax can be brave and

13:45.720 --> 13:52.120
a tactless very cowardly I think I mean not that I'm very taxful and I'm very I'm a huge

13:52.120 --> 13:57.640
coward I don't know how I don't know how brave tact is how cowardly I mean that's that's

13:57.640 --> 14:05.240
like I that's a huge question I am a I am a I am a I don't I don't think I have a right

14:05.240 --> 14:14.040
to say this about myself but I just as a just as a shortcut a autistic type and a lot of

14:14.040 --> 14:32.440
my fans are like dramatic as pergatastic and I and I love them and you yourself I you Spencer

14:32.440 --> 14:37.800
is my dungeon master chauffeur and personal assistant and he picks me up in the morning

14:37.800 --> 14:44.640
and I get into your Subaru and I I some we can drive for a half hour and not talk to

14:44.640 --> 14:48.400
each other yeah sometimes you play your podcast of those guys that play those Nintendo songs

14:48.400 --> 14:52.880
and then argue about what genre they are and stuff and this yeah we just I'm just listening

14:52.880 --> 15:00.400
to 16-bit music from Spencer's youth it's like and and and then sometimes we'll listen

15:00.400 --> 15:05.680
to a podcast about you know how they're made or dolphins and sometimes we'll talk about

15:05.680 --> 15:10.400
Minecraft but we don't have to do anything I don't have to look at you we don't look

15:10.400 --> 15:13.640
at each other we'll never get mad at each other you'll never like slam a door and I'll

15:13.640 --> 15:20.240
be like baby what's up I just you know it's been a long time since you said you appreciated

15:20.240 --> 15:29.080
me that is a luxury we have as Vulcans then there's this handicaps when we deal with other

15:29.080 --> 15:33.880
people they go like sometimes they slam doors and we go what's going on I don't understand

15:33.880 --> 15:37.000
well it's been a long time since you said you appreciated me well I don't know what

15:37.000 --> 15:41.880
the fuck you're talking about also just close the door and be mad yes can't you just stop

15:41.880 --> 15:52.800
feeling things yeah isn't it on you the thing that's making you cry unplug it why is this

15:52.800 --> 16:04.280
solution to make me fucking more that when I'm still able to saw wood while ignoring

16:04.280 --> 16:14.760
your feelings what if aliens attack and they go quick get them they're all crying you'll

16:14.760 --> 16:19.960
be the only survivor damn well they will turn to us and they will go Asperger people help

16:19.960 --> 16:26.560
us there are worm men from the moon attacking us and we'll laugh at them yes well we'll

16:26.560 --> 16:32.720
perish yes and then they'll go yeah you're laughing you're human and I will die the anyways

16:32.720 --> 16:38.120
what was my point I was saying like I'm used to these interactions and I value them I like

16:38.120 --> 16:45.680
I like people who can't make eye contact with me I like I like people who want to have honest

16:45.680 --> 16:50.880
conversations and sincere ones and get down to the nitty gritty but there's also there's

16:50.880 --> 16:57.440
a there's a cowardly version of tactlessness there's the I don't make small talk version

16:57.440 --> 17:03.040
and then there's the actually I do I am gonna say what's easy I am gonna just like barf

17:03.040 --> 17:08.640
up some weird shit because I think that it's like some kind of weird strategic way to put

17:08.640 --> 17:14.080
you off kilter and you know make you vulnerable and you can see that technique being implied

17:14.080 --> 17:17.880
and you're like what are you trying to do why are you so you think that saying hello

17:17.880 --> 17:22.640
I I like you is like something weak people do so you're gonna say you're gonna insult

17:22.640 --> 17:28.320
me or you know put me off and I'm gonna like hang a you know a Star Wars metal around your

17:28.320 --> 17:34.000
neck and go like you're the first person that ever like barfed shit on me and an elevator

17:34.000 --> 17:40.560
that's what those people aren't right like that happens a lot to people who like you

17:40.560 --> 17:45.400
like people are like I'm sure everyone does this so I'm gonna but then all of those people

17:45.400 --> 17:51.680
are doing that exact same thing I yes I mean but but I would I would put a big asterisk

17:51.680 --> 17:58.420
on that and say that anyone that that it likes me is better than other people like I buy

17:58.420 --> 18:03.200
in large like because by the time you make it over those walls see that's like you are

18:03.200 --> 18:11.600
a marine you are a better person so even my worst fan I think would beat you know Kevin

18:11.600 --> 18:18.640
Smith's best fan in a in a fan off I don't know just in a general like I feel like and

18:18.640 --> 18:23.800
that please I hope that gauntlet doesn't get too thrown down that's the last thing I need

18:23.800 --> 18:29.720
well weird because you know use if someone likes me I'm a self-hating individual someone

18:29.720 --> 18:35.840
likes me I instantly hate them like I just I don't trust them it's like why they need

18:35.840 --> 18:38.760
to earn your trust if they like you you they need to earn your trust well because it's

18:38.760 --> 18:44.760
like you I mean what do you what are you looking at I mean it's a big fat guy right do I have

18:44.760 --> 18:49.680
gold in my ear or something I don't like what do you do I have gold in my ear I usually

18:49.680 --> 18:56.840
do that's the thing you usually do yeah I mean it's a big problem in my life people are

18:56.840 --> 19:03.320
always trying to get out the gold in my ear and it's they're gold diggers guest Comptroller

19:03.320 --> 19:11.440
Spencer Crittenden everybody just how many there's no right or wrong answer to how many

19:11.440 --> 19:16.440
people are I know you're all you'll registered with XOXO so you could be in this room but

19:16.440 --> 19:22.120
how many of you in addition to that are fans of Harmontown the podcast hey not that many

19:22.120 --> 19:26.320

19:26.320 --> 19:31.440
half hour I apologize I thought I was the most of these people like when's he gonna talk

19:31.440 --> 19:42.800

19:42.800 --> 19:50.160
of innovation in any sort of medium I want to I want to I want to meet somebody from

19:50.160 --> 19:54.960
Portland I don't know if there's any of those people here but I think we have to be more

19:54.960 --> 19:59.600
specific than that we have we want to reward usually at Harmontown what we do is we bring

19:59.600 --> 20:02.800
up people who have traveled the farthest but that would be kind of pointless here because

20:02.800 --> 20:08.280
we've traveled so I want to meet a Portland person and but how do you pick the right Portland

20:08.280 --> 20:18.560
person to talk to no sorry what whoever's closest to this geographic point we invert

20:18.560 --> 20:23.520
the whole thing okay who lives the closest to this abandoned steel mill we have so we

20:23.520 --> 20:29.460

21:26.080 --> 21:30.520
of the word salmon I think we're on salmon or something yeah all right what's your name

21:30.520 --> 21:35.520
young lady McKenna are you are you willing to come up and talk to us we don't we don't

21:35.520 --> 21:45.040
pick on people it's not like a I'm not like Jim Norton or also I already forgot your name

21:45.040 --> 21:52.760
because I get nervous McKenna McKenna that's your first name okay kind of weird most people

21:52.760 --> 22:01.200
use it as their last name it's fine give a round of applause to McKenna everybody you

22:01.200 --> 22:07.720
can take that mic and have a seat are you are you allowed to drink yeah do you want to

22:07.720 --> 22:13.640
drink I'm not drinking up right now are you you're 21 yeah okay do you want to do you

22:13.640 --> 22:18.800
want to vodka that's all we have that that would be amazing we have a basin of molten

22:18.800 --> 22:26.560
steel in the back too okay I can make you iron pants hey Elizabeth can you make McKenna

22:26.560 --> 22:38.080
a drink Elizabeth is our drink maker for the evening thank you she also happens to be dating

22:38.080 --> 22:46.880
our producer Dustin Marshall but I swear to God you can get this job just by working hard

22:46.880 --> 22:53.920
it's not is an egalitarian meritocracy yeah at Harmontown there's absolutely no reason

22:53.920 --> 23:00.320
why you couldn't absolutely replace her no foam head on that if you talk to her after

23:00.320 --> 23:06.600
the show you know it within your conversation feel her out for weaknesses see if you can

23:06.600 --> 23:10.880
see if you can figure out a way to get in there this is my ultimate weakness happening

23:10.880 --> 23:19.840
at the moment what is it being in front of a ton of people yeah I hate it too yeah okay

23:19.840 --> 23:24.520
yeah well you'll get used to it it's it doesn't you have to just like I don't know picture

23:24.520 --> 23:30.720
them in your underwear okay and then they're like uncomfortable because they're like these

23:30.720 --> 23:36.840
haven't been washed and well that's mean she probably washes her underwear come on oh yeah

23:36.840 --> 23:46.000
picture them in my underwear yeah so McKenna it's gotta take me a while to get used to

23:46.000 --> 23:51.000
that one of your best friends is called McKenna I know that's why it's like McKenna like I

23:51.000 --> 23:56.160
want to I want you to like take a bullet for me I don't want to treat you well we'll see

23:56.160 --> 24:01.240
how this conversation goes okay all right so McKenna you so what do you think of those

24:01.240 --> 24:12.360
people over on cooch seem kind of entitled yeah yeah I'm closer than Morrison everybody

24:12.360 --> 24:17.720
pay attention to me at least the worst is when people say couch though that's how you

24:17.720 --> 24:26.080
like know their is it spelled couch yeah okay so it's it's the new you're the New York Houston

24:26.080 --> 24:34.440
trap that's terrible Houston Houston and then if you don't say Houston then you know fuck

24:34.440 --> 24:42.200
this guy kick him out of New York his crystal on his palm starts blinking Houston they take

24:42.200 --> 24:49.040
you up and they drop you into the Statue of Liberty's torch same with Edinburgh Scotland

24:49.040 --> 24:57.720
and you say it like you say it like like butter you go and butter and butter yeah and butter

24:57.720 --> 25:09.200
and butter anyways McKenna so how long have you lived in Portland around 11 years wow okay

25:09.200 --> 25:18.760
and so since you were three yeah the the so you moved here from where I'm from Oregon

25:18.760 --> 25:25.440
right so we're still in our south of here all right oh so you just you you you're like me

25:25.440 --> 25:30.480
in Wisconsin you you were you were you were born in a vat in the suburbs kind of like

25:30.480 --> 25:36.080
somewhere in a basement your parents hit you with a belt and then sent you to move to the

25:36.080 --> 25:45.000
city yeah all right and said I'm gonna show all of you Madison guy just yelled out yes

25:45.000 --> 25:56.640
that is a city in Wisconsin I think that's the guy that read me the pitch I can't tell

25:56.640 --> 26:02.920
I can't tell I don't think so it's bright the lights are bright but I mean you haven't

26:02.920 --> 26:07.120
lived until and they just reciting it and then he was like hey but I figured what the

26:07.120 --> 26:16.960
hell and I'm like yeah what could it hurt you to read me a pitch I don't have a pitch

26:16.960 --> 26:22.000
for you thank you there's gonna be a gunshot from the back and my career is gonna be over

26:22.000 --> 26:27.920
for the dumbest reason in the world not because you're dead though right because the other

26:27.920 --> 26:35.240
guy because the other guy all right don't try to keep track here have you ever listened

26:35.240 --> 26:47.960
to this podcast oh okay yes the so my fiance and I have been to Portland now probably like

26:47.960 --> 26:56.560
I think between us five times the last time it got pretty severe the Portland thing like

26:56.560 --> 27:02.760
it gets in your blood you're into it yeah yeah like it happens we want to move here

27:02.760 --> 27:07.080
so I and I can't get a read on the Portland people because usually the next thing that

27:07.080 --> 27:12.280
happens when you want to move to a city is you talk to somebody and they say everyone

27:12.280 --> 27:18.000
feels that way fuck off the reason you feel that way is because nobody's moving here but

27:18.000 --> 27:22.600
you're but you're a good example because a lot of people come here like now in the summertime

27:22.600 --> 27:28.280
and they're like Portland's amazing and then they actually move here and it's like ten

27:28.280 --> 27:35.800
months of shit right but you're but you when you guys say shit you mean my favorite thing

27:35.800 --> 27:45.840
in the world which is Blade Runner weather every day is Blade Runner like I don't want

27:45.840 --> 27:52.480
to walk around in a fucking awesome trench coat and I think the shitty weather like creates

27:52.480 --> 27:59.000
cooler people kind of like you know you go to somewhere sunny and people are all right

27:59.000 --> 28:04.960
but you come here and everybody's like maybe a little angsty but creative and making things

28:04.960 --> 28:09.640
well the sun is I mean the thing is when you go to a restaurant there's there could be

28:09.640 --> 28:15.920
a culture where people say to you you know you know the best place to sit is right by

28:15.920 --> 28:21.840
the kitchen the source of all restaurants things that's where all the food is made that's

28:21.840 --> 28:25.680
what the sun is you don't want to sit near the kitchen it's also really shit it's a

28:25.680 --> 28:31.480
fucking fusion reactor in the sky it's giving you cancer it's like it's it's it's burning

28:31.480 --> 28:40.960
your children it's it hurts magnificent characters like powder remember that guy that's that

28:40.960 --> 28:45.800
guys the best our planet can do like and he doesn't want the sun you know who powder

28:45.800 --> 28:52.200
is for it yeah he has psychic powers and he's not yes the sun technically like the kitchen

28:52.200 --> 28:57.160
in a restaurant it makes things happen yes that's where the shrimp goes into the basket

28:57.160 --> 29:02.720
I don't want the booth next to the fucking kitchen I want to be in the dark corner like

29:02.720 --> 29:08.960
I want to be in an indirect result of the sun yeah so appreciate the sun for what it

29:08.960 --> 29:16.400
did but you don't need to like yes I'm a fan of the sun like it's like like Paul Verhoeven

29:16.400 --> 29:26.520
like like good job a while ago and and for that I will never turn my back on you

29:26.520 --> 29:36.240
the sun is the Quentin Tarantino of the solar system like permanent decision made I rely

29:36.240 --> 29:43.640
on you I think you were amazing you know kill Bill being a two-parter is fine if that's

29:43.640 --> 29:56.360
what comes with it so but does the rain get to you over time when you

29:56.360 --> 30:06.440
but you don't know because you were in Oregon already like you Oregon Oregon yeah that's

30:06.440 --> 30:14.800
a small violation that's I didn't say Oregon I said Oregon oh what I think that's what they

30:14.800 --> 30:23.040
were doing yeah okay I mean that's a lame thing to hold your ground on that's that's

30:23.040 --> 30:29.360
one vowel like what do you guys do to Canadians I mean I'm sure they come they probably call

30:29.360 --> 30:37.720
it Brigadoon here the that doesn't make any sense the but but but you you you were born

30:37.720 --> 30:46.320
under an umbrella yeah so it does though yeah around like June when it's still like shitting

30:46.320 --> 30:52.040
on you you start to get a little that's the June gloom right yeah you start to get a little

30:52.040 --> 30:56.760
crazy and right now everybody's very happy cuz they're like oh the sun's out and it's

30:56.760 --> 31:01.640
gonna start rain yeah and like the Oregonians I think about now are like okay I'm ready

31:01.640 --> 31:08.200
to start wearing coats again like I don't people are very conflicted about now I just

31:08.200 --> 31:14.560
realized we've been talking about the weather and our podcast I'm so sorry I apologize what's

31:14.560 --> 31:21.280
the opposite of the weather in conversation do you believe in God McKenna let's just skip

31:21.280 --> 31:27.840
to why not well after today I'm questioning cuz he made it so wonderful that you're thinking

31:27.840 --> 31:36.000
of converting back to know where your parents religious no not at all I never went to church

31:36.000 --> 31:40.520
did you resent them for not being a religious no come on you wanted a little bit of God

31:40.520 --> 31:46.120
I'm very open-minded because of it so they were nice intellectual parents yeah they let

31:46.120 --> 31:51.480
me go to church with like my friends and I would go to church and be like fuck this is boring like

31:51.480 --> 31:56.840
what is happening then you come home and they're like I told you I told you to go to an orgy

31:56.840 --> 32:12.680
yeah okay all right fucking Portland there's sacrilegious here so what's the what's the

32:12.680 --> 32:18.320
trying to think of the opposite of talking about the weather what's the worst thing you've ever

32:18.320 --> 32:28.120
done to another human being that's a really hard question yeah I know I asked that of a

32:28.120 --> 32:35.280
podcast guest at one point and he immediately knew and it was he made he made his brother drink

32:35.280 --> 32:43.040
his own pee but just he gave him it told him it was lemonade and I I've definitely done a few

32:43.040 --> 32:47.560
things like that when I was little or like dirt mixtures that you give to like the neighbor girl

32:47.560 --> 32:57.080
like no no you know the thing where you make the girl eat the dirt like no you need to tell us

32:57.080 --> 33:04.640
about that little hazing what did you do what's the dirt what's the dirt girl story because

33:04.640 --> 33:10.400
it's not universal I definitely I mean that there was definitely a little girl that lived

33:10.400 --> 33:15.640
across the street from me who was like probably five years younger or something so of course

33:15.640 --> 33:21.720
she was like super excited to hang out with the older like I'm so cool you know like hang out

33:21.720 --> 33:27.320
with the cool older girl and it was like you know torture so your instinct to haze yeah

33:27.320 --> 33:30.440
you're like yeah that's what we were just talking about people that like you there was

33:30.440 --> 33:39.400
some dirt with like vanilla flavoring and water in a cup and be like here this is good yeah yeah

33:39.400 --> 33:46.960
and then she ate it yeah and then like would go home and cry because she ate dirt yeah how old were

33:46.960 --> 33:57.400
you at that point maybe like 23 30 like 12 yeah that means I mean that's when you're like the

33:57.400 --> 34:04.400
biggest asshole well you don't have you know human human people we don't have like what we define

34:04.400 --> 34:09.160
as I don't know whether you some people would call it morality some people just call it a

34:09.160 --> 34:13.840
conscious conscience like we don't have that compass built into us we're the most adaptable

34:13.840 --> 34:17.680
species on the earth and we you don't you don't get there by having some ingrained thing that

34:17.680 --> 34:22.200
we won't do like we'll do anything to anybody that our parents tell us okay and we kind of like

34:22.200 --> 34:27.360
we we learn kind of over time we're like oh you know what life is more fucked up if we keep doing

34:27.360 --> 34:31.560
shit that we just want to do and we don't start thinking about other people but like eight year

34:31.560 --> 34:37.120
olds are sociopaths they're they're just like pull the wings off a shit and like like yeah and

34:37.120 --> 34:42.960
you they I don't I don't what's unclear is do they learn do they biologically hit a point where

34:42.960 --> 34:47.800
they're like okay I'm gonna stop doing that or do or do you just have to stop them like you kind of

34:47.800 --> 34:54.920
want to like make a big iron cube maybe in this steel mill and like drop a bunch of human children

34:54.920 --> 35:00.480
into it and just do a bunch of experiments but then you'd realize wait maybe I'm doing this

35:00.480 --> 35:07.720
because I didn't learn how to be moral I know that I know that your brain is made out of all

35:07.720 --> 35:13.440
these like you know there's like there's a biological capitalistic like board meeting in your

35:13.440 --> 35:19.800
brain every day where where different departments of your brain kind of compete for resources and

35:19.800 --> 35:26.480
so when you're a kid like if they say that if you raise a kid in an environment where I can't

35:26.480 --> 35:34.080
stand up and I think we should all try this tonight that if the kid comes out of that like

35:34.080 --> 35:41.560
two foot high like you know crawl space at an age after their legs are fully able muscularily to

35:41.560 --> 35:48.800
walk they even if you like give them like regarding Henry physical therapy they will never

35:48.800 --> 35:54.200
because their brain that part of their brain the one that dedicates resources to motor function in

35:54.200 --> 36:00.880
their legs has long ago been zoned out during some city board meeting in its brain I was like no

36:00.880 --> 36:07.640
there's no need to walk this person needs to navigate darkness and crawl hand over hand and

36:07.640 --> 36:14.160
change light bulbs or whatever they're doing down there telekinesis maybe some people just

36:14.160 --> 36:20.200
realize how to only be an asshole when they're young I think that I think that the I think that

36:20.200 --> 36:25.640
pot it's possible I'd like to be more optimistic than this but I think it's possible of it being

36:25.640 --> 36:35.680
that compassion might be like facial recognition walking you know being good with feng shui these

36:35.680 --> 36:41.440
might just be little little talents we have and being compassionate actually yields positive

36:41.440 --> 36:47.160
results you know long-term for kids on the playground hopefully I'm sure it's that yeah I

36:47.160 --> 36:50.360
don't think it's inherent but that's a bummer though that's like thinking they were all like

36:50.360 --> 36:55.640
these empty canisters of just flash that are just waiting to be either made into serial killers

36:55.640 --> 37:02.320
or saints yeah that's that's the whole land somewhere way between some bummer I guess I

37:02.320 --> 37:06.760
think it's awesome but it's also kind of yeah it's kind of amazing at the same time because

37:06.760 --> 37:12.480
then some people grow to be so amazing yeah well it's the same but what's a but what about them

37:12.480 --> 37:18.000
what about the lack of meaning to being amazing like do you why is it like it just happens at

37:18.000 --> 37:23.840
random but the randomness makes it beautiful you're saying I think so why can you like the

37:23.840 --> 37:30.400
role of a die but why is that more beautiful why is chaos more beautiful than than purpose

37:30.400 --> 37:35.160
because it's uh it's like the antithesis of everything we seek it's like oh we're just

37:35.160 --> 37:39.480
going the wrong way about it we just got to accept that it's randomness and derive meaning

37:39.480 --> 37:45.440
out of that I think that's cool like I mean it's one thing to like catch on to a meaning that

37:45.440 --> 37:49.320
already exists that's like seeing a bird but it's another thing to like you know like I'm

37:49.320 --> 37:56.880
gonna invent the bird it's a common a common example I think we can all relate to creating

37:56.880 --> 38:04.680
our own foul right so I say I don't know if I have the ability to articulate this you're

38:04.680 --> 38:13.720
saying that within if we accept that our nature is chaotic we can achieve a meta order yeah

38:13.720 --> 38:18.720
well also just that like okay so if it was predestined that I was supposed to just say I

38:18.720 --> 38:23.720
mean be here today that's not very interesting that's a that's a that's part of a list there's

38:23.720 --> 38:29.040
a long list of things like the fact that I'm here because of several crazy random factors

38:29.040 --> 38:33.680
that could never happen to anyone else just because of sheer probability and stuff I find

38:33.680 --> 38:40.800
that amazing and more potentially miraculous than like someone with a plan making making

38:40.800 --> 38:44.960
the rules for everything I don't know like our friendship is the result of a random occurrence

38:44.960 --> 38:48.400
you came to the show and I said is there a dungeon master here and you raised your hand

38:48.400 --> 38:55.920
and now we're friends yeah and and more than friends employees right view yeah I wear many

38:55.920 --> 39:03.000
hats but that same chaos means that I could have a strange happening in my brain that

39:03.000 --> 39:06.040
makes me lunge across the table and rip your face off because I think it's a sandwich which

39:06.040 --> 39:12.360
is also really fascinating right but you will die will you die going like I'll life I'll

39:12.360 --> 39:18.360
take three I don't think you can take three that's the problem right all right maybe

39:18.360 --> 39:22.800
that's my problem I want to buy life in bulk maybe it's just that I'm a dungeon master

39:22.800 --> 39:28.000
though because I just everything I do is rolling dice it's all randomness and then we start

39:28.000 --> 39:33.960
to understand that those same rules of dice rolling are just genetics and particle collisions

39:33.960 --> 39:38.760
it's all just all these weird probabilistic things that happen it's I think that's just

39:38.760 --> 39:44.640
like understanding the code to the universe and the idea that your brain is well it's

39:44.640 --> 39:51.000
looking at the die rolls is the result of a bunch of die rolls over billions of years

39:51.000 --> 39:56.080
and hundreds of billions of years if you go I mean like the big bang forward like random

39:56.080 --> 40:03.280
collisions turning into RNA turning into primordial soup turning into evolutionary Cold War or

40:03.280 --> 40:07.920
hot war between organisms resulting in the biological weapons survival wise that is your

40:07.920 --> 40:13.680
brain that in addition to recognizing red apples and yellow bananas is able to recognize

40:13.680 --> 40:20.840
numbers on a die and create a game that is based on random numbers so you're using the

40:20.840 --> 40:27.440
end result of a bunch of randomness to look at infantile randomness simulations of fundamental

40:27.440 --> 40:32.240
randomness and we have fun and we pretend that there's order we pretend that there's

40:32.240 --> 40:38.240
good guys and bad guys and and we but we and we seek meaning but but you can find peace

40:38.240 --> 40:42.400
by accepting that there is no meaning yeah and I mean what you're talking about order

40:42.400 --> 40:47.120
is like the only order is what we add to it you know it's what we're ordering around in

40:47.120 --> 40:55.000
the randomness I think that's a cool part of it thanks man I appreciate that but what

40:55.000 --> 41:05.000
does that have to do with pushing can you hear me Portland more like pushing land sorry

41:05.000 --> 41:17.760
speaking to pussy let's bring my fiance up here we have to figure out I'm gonna stand

41:17.760 --> 41:26.760
is there I think we don't have enough there's another mic you set I can coach it no no no

41:26.760 --> 41:33.120
well that's I don't know no I want you to set like on the pedestal that you belong on am

41:33.120 --> 41:37.920
I am I still want to be put on a pedestal being me down by putting me up and you stay

41:37.920 --> 41:46.800
seated oh you're from Portland I got to be a girl but I love your hair oh thank you

41:46.800 --> 41:52.240
looks great like a mermaid mare of a fairy grove yeah everyone listens to the runway

41:52.240 --> 41:56.520
I've seen a ton of girls with purple in their hair and I was kind of like I want to like

41:56.520 --> 42:02.960
gather all of us together and get like a group purple hair shot because I feel like most people

42:02.960 --> 42:09.640
have purple I'm down for any color but purple seems to be a popular I felt like when I was

42:09.640 --> 42:14.800
looking for people that were lived closer to this steel mill the hair got more purple

42:14.800 --> 42:21.200
as I hope I hope five years from now we don't find out this is some kind of cluster the

42:21.200 --> 42:25.120
cool color remember a couple weeks ago when you came home and my hair was gray I was trying

42:25.120 --> 42:32.920
to do that I love the gray actually like I thought it for fall I might go gray oh man

42:32.920 --> 42:38.400
that look amazing it's like witchy witchy yeah have you seen the gray with Liam Easton

42:38.400 --> 42:49.960
so I'm going for it doesn't matter what color your hair is the wolf will eat you he's a

42:49.960 --> 42:56.360
predator a biological killing machine he doesn't care about your hair it doesn't matter if

42:56.360 --> 43:02.600
we make a fire doesn't matter if we wake up doesn't matter how many legs you have doesn't

43:02.600 --> 43:09.280
matter if they're in the snow doesn't matter if we walk five feet or five hundred feet

43:09.280 --> 43:16.800
it's it doesn't matter that we're here it the wolves may walk by not see us it doesn't

43:16.800 --> 43:23.360
matter if they don't see us they might smell us if the sequel to the gray took place in

43:23.360 --> 43:30.040
Portland and there was that same monologue what would that sound like it doesn't matter

43:30.040 --> 43:37.440
if they're uncouch it doesn't matter if they're the sandy hut doesn't matter if they enjoy

43:37.440 --> 43:43.160
shuffleboard if they're a day drinker or a hipster drinker it doesn't matter if they

43:43.160 --> 43:50.480
innovate it doesn't matter if they remember that they used to make yogurt hair it doesn't

43:50.480 --> 43:57.680
matter if the video game is independent or corporate it doesn't matter if women are

43:57.680 --> 44:06.840
properly represented in the video game genre the wolf will still eat you we're arguing

44:06.840 --> 44:11.480
about about whether or not the Tomb Raider should have big tits but the wolf just sees

44:11.480 --> 44:33.320
a hot dog I want to talk I want to talk about one thing I want to talk about the plane ride

44:33.320 --> 44:39.880
here and the fact that I've noticed this because I've traveled by plane enough to know that

44:39.880 --> 44:47.720
this isn't a fluke sometimes okay let me start with all the time all the time the food is

44:47.720 --> 44:57.120
bad yes yes the peanuts are too small the every time without exception everyone in this room

44:57.120 --> 45:03.120
who's ever been in a plane no one will argue with this every time you're on a plane the

45:03.120 --> 45:11.440
position of your seat back is catastrophically important to them the people who are in charge

45:11.440 --> 45:17.000
of whether you live or die because the plane is a piece of equipment that is defying physics

45:17.000 --> 45:23.200
flying through the air like a metal fucking rock and you and you were in it and your seat

45:23.200 --> 45:30.880
being back or forward to them is a big deal you for instance if you'd like to test this

45:30.880 --> 45:39.800
theory try keeping your seat back the whole time they won't let you we all know this we

45:39.800 --> 45:47.360
accept it your seat has to be forward when you land now sometimes and I find this very

45:47.360 --> 45:55.000
interesting sometimes your seat doesn't work now the reason I find this interesting is

45:55.000 --> 46:03.280
because the times your seat doesn't work is because the airline is shitty and the airplane

46:03.280 --> 46:09.040
isn't working right and it is though time those times not when you need your seat to

46:09.040 --> 46:16.320
be back it is it is their failure that immediately solves the problem I find that very interesting

46:16.320 --> 46:21.680
I feel like she already knows the story she's annoyed by it but I'm like I'm not I'm I find

46:21.680 --> 46:27.480
this very interesting I've had this conversation so many times where like my seat my seat is

46:27.480 --> 46:33.920
like half back and the person comes by and they go I really need that seat to be up before

46:33.920 --> 46:41.960
we land and that could have been a woman or a gay man the the and I go like it doesn't

46:41.960 --> 46:47.120
I'm hey man you try make it go make it do what you need it to do in order for the plane

46:47.120 --> 46:54.680
to land and they go oh it doesn't work oh okay fuck it fuck it because it's our fault

46:54.680 --> 47:01.440
fuck it because the plane doesn't work it's a crisis if it's on you it's fuck it if it's

47:01.440 --> 47:08.080
on them hey I'm sorry we really need that engine to be on the wing well the engine's

47:08.080 --> 47:12.600
not on the wing it won't it came disconnected it up in the air the plane is doing a fucking

47:12.600 --> 47:30.600
barrel roll toward the soil oh okay well sorry fuck it I hope you live I'm on your side but

47:30.600 --> 47:36.760
and I get it I get your frustration but that guy coming by he just has to his his big crisis

47:36.760 --> 47:41.120
is that he wakes up every day and has to tell a bunch of people in an airplane in 2014 to

47:41.120 --> 47:46.280
not smoke in an airplane and to do all these things and then he's walk I mean he said fuck

47:46.280 --> 47:51.280
it because like that's how he feels yeah exactly exactly but what what if you were a secret

47:51.280 --> 47:57.480
flyer what is that oh a person who knows about these secret flyers like a death's head officer

47:57.480 --> 48:03.560
that's attending to be a tourist like my seat can go back you just need to try harder prisoner

48:03.560 --> 48:09.720
number 137 okay I understand your frustration I have a personal connection to this because

48:09.720 --> 48:15.480
after this happened I was awaking from a beautiful nap I ever heard the interaction which is fine

48:15.480 --> 48:19.720
because I have similar interactions and then I unfortunately said to you I don't think it was

48:19.720 --> 48:27.720
that big of a deal and then I was I was on the other side of the Gaza Strip because the

48:27.720 --> 48:36.840
Gaza Strip is a line on a ping-pong table the other side of the you know you know what I mean

48:36.840 --> 48:42.320
the point being and what I said to you is it's of course it's not a big deal that's the tyranny

48:42.320 --> 48:48.280
of course it's not a big deal there's not no one's gonna of course no one's gonna hit me

48:48.280 --> 48:55.840
on the writing talk about the body body scanning machines how you opt out and I don't I opt out

48:55.840 --> 49:02.960
thank you the more I said opt out the sooner that those things are fucking taken out of the

49:02.960 --> 49:10.040
airports you know who doesn't opt out who loves just getting fucked in the anus with an airplane

49:10.040 --> 49:18.200
wing well it's not knock that that's a lot of fun actually sounds great they're kind of tapered

49:18.200 --> 49:21.760
at the end and then they get slowly bigger toward the body of the plane there's a lot of

49:21.760 --> 49:28.400
variety then there's an engine in the middle of it with like a suction like turbine I'm going

49:28.400 --> 49:35.000
from here to Tarzana California to market the airplane wing build-up when you opt out don't

49:35.000 --> 49:42.280
you get like harassed yes exactly you like every time I opt out I get taken to like the

49:42.280 --> 49:52.880
little room or do you say like they test something on your clothes and then they're

49:52.880 --> 49:59.240
like oh it's a hair gel that's setting the alarm off we have to take you back for a search you

49:59.240 --> 50:03.160
got to stop wearing that maybe this is the Portland airport I think you have to stop being

50:03.160 --> 50:10.920
an Italian porno's it's had bad luck I don't know I mean a very mixed experience I mean it's

50:10.920 --> 50:15.680
not it's not great but I think most people are pretty nice though there are some airports

50:15.680 --> 50:27.360
where they're like you're opting out and then an hour later someone comes over and I'm not

50:27.360 --> 50:32.160
going to disclose what part of the country that was but they've definitely been instructed it's

50:32.160 --> 50:37.240
it's out they can't keep a secret it's not like it's the fucking though today I had a very nice

50:37.240 --> 50:43.760
conversation and I you know I become as I've gotten older I've really cherished my female

50:43.760 --> 50:52.840
friendships and there is something to staring in the eyes of a strange TSA woman who says to you

50:52.840 --> 51:01.360
I'm going to take my hands up between your legs until I first several times I did this I got this

51:01.360 --> 51:06.680
line until I think they corrected it I'm going to take my hands up your thighs until I meet the

51:06.680 --> 51:20.040
resistance the first time I was like the resistance hiding out in there thank you for

51:20.040 --> 51:24.080
fighting the good fight until I meet the resistance they're supposed to say resistance

51:24.080 --> 51:28.560
which also I don't like to think of my pussy as resistance I don't want it I don't want to

51:28.560 --> 51:33.580
think of it as a portal either but I don't want to think of it as some sort of like force

51:33.580 --> 51:39.720
feel it's not like happy cartoon hashtag happy cartoon but today I had a really nice

51:39.720 --> 51:44.360
conversation with this young woman who is like airports right and I'm like you're telling me

51:44.360 --> 51:50.240
as she's like touching my boobs and I'm like this is cool that we can have this moment like you

51:50.240 --> 51:57.040
know which is used to dance in the forest and I like the idea that your vagina is the resistance

51:57.040 --> 52:03.640
because I like I like that you're I love you for your humanity and I when I think of the

52:03.640 --> 52:14.320
resistance I think of the TV the TV miniseries event V from the 80s like I think of your vagina

52:14.320 --> 52:19.960
as like spray painting over propaganda that was put there by aliens and going like fuck it we

52:19.960 --> 52:29.960
can fight and I'm like yeah I love awesome I love this vagina it fights you know I mean it

52:29.960 --> 52:35.000
does make you feel like a battleship a little bit or they're like do you have any devices no ma'am

52:35.000 --> 52:42.040
I do not but I could yeah I could have some some devices that's a thing I'm just learning

52:42.040 --> 52:46.680
about this thing you stand before you say anything this is my own expression that I came

52:46.680 --> 52:51.560
up with it's not like common vernacular no but I want to I think it's it's intuitive yeah

52:51.560 --> 52:58.320
exactly yeah you know what I mean when I say a kangaroo who hears kangaroo before no no let's

52:58.320 --> 53:03.920
say you're going to be dishonest across the country yeah I don't believe that they're just

53:03.920 --> 53:09.120
lying out there yeah like you guys didn't go to a concert where they're searching for she means

53:09.120 --> 53:15.200
putting a nickel bag of marijuana in your vagina or or anything that might need to get through

53:15.200 --> 53:21.880
some kind of checkpoint you've never no one in Portland has ever used their birth you know it

53:21.880 --> 53:30.680
takes a lot to see the nobility in kangarooing I do those you know I don't opt out I go through

53:30.680 --> 53:36.600
the back scanner machines and every time I like it's probably psychosomatic but every time I just

53:36.600 --> 53:42.720
like my balls hurt afterwards it's like there I could just feel you know all those little guys

53:42.720 --> 53:47.560
dying I feel I feel lightheaded I always feel lightheaded it's weird it's got to be site like

53:47.560 --> 53:52.080
they can't really be happening right it's all but but then again what would make more sense I mean

53:52.080 --> 53:57.240
what if there's anything useful happening in that machine to them then it of course it's like you

53:57.240 --> 54:02.560
could feel it I don't know I thought really good about my decision to opt out when early on some

54:02.560 --> 54:09.200
TSA TSA agent said to me oh you know they took out a 70% of the radiation do you know that they

54:09.200 --> 54:13.520
took out 70% and then another guy was like no a hundred percent I was like fucking no no you're

54:13.520 --> 54:18.000
talking about it they took they're like oh we should we should really take out this radio they

54:18.000 --> 54:22.120
can't take that's not the way that's not the way it works like it's salad dressing like they're

54:22.120 --> 54:29.600
like yeah that's the only thing that they got it's in the same way that I fucking resent when I go

54:29.600 --> 54:34.000
to urban outfitters and I'm trying to return a sweater and someone's like have you worn this like

54:34.000 --> 54:38.520
when I when I haven't and I know I have not worn the sweater I don't know and it's like is your

54:38.520 --> 54:43.160
last name urban outfitters I know you're making ten dollars an hour and I'm a human being and

54:43.160 --> 54:46.800
you're a human being and guess what's not a human being is urban outfitters fucking take my

54:46.800 --> 54:54.960
sweater right Asian M is worse and then the same way with the TSA agents when they're like yeah

54:54.960 --> 54:58.840
you know they took out the radiation it's like what the what what on your deathbed are you

54:58.840 --> 55:06.360
gonna say I was a company man but like it's a it's it's a radiation dispenser that's its job

55:06.360 --> 55:11.560
how do they take out the radiation no exactly it's just a box I looked it up afterwards and

55:11.560 --> 55:16.840
it's there's nothing to it one guy one day was right I have ice in my mouth like a there's an

55:16.840 --> 55:21.240
urban legend or or or it's true but I will say it's an urban legend so I want to spread things

55:21.240 --> 55:27.640
that I don't want to be totally irresponsible but there's a you know there's legend has it

55:27.640 --> 55:33.200
that the guy that invented that machine won't go through it yeah how many how many people

55:33.200 --> 55:38.840
you're you're Portland do you guys opt out when you go to the airport the port port port port

55:38.840 --> 55:43.880
Portland has a has a beautiful airport don't they I mean they kind of pretty nice they have

55:43.880 --> 55:48.880
two little shops and stuff I opt out because of the philosophy of it because of a big brother

55:48.880 --> 55:54.760
bullshit of it and but what would you say to somebody that said well what about a metal

55:54.760 --> 55:59.640
detector I mean just because we had no that's fine but I mean with the rule exactly I mean

55:59.640 --> 56:06.640
with the I don't know I I'm going to I'm not the I'm not the voice of this cause but the

56:08.040 --> 56:14.760
the idea of I mean those body scanner machines really don't detect that much and if someone

56:14.760 --> 56:19.880
is really trying to smuggle something they can it just seems to me that they're developing

56:19.880 --> 56:25.560
technologies so they can take pictures of us all the time and so they can just ease shit in I

56:25.560 --> 56:29.840
don't know it's a little conspiracy theories of me but also I'm like fuck you I just paid

56:29.840 --> 56:33.600
five hundred dollars per flight and I have to stand with my arms out and there are pictures

56:33.600 --> 56:38.280
of what it looks like on another screen and then I don't know it just bugs me and also

56:38.280 --> 56:42.400
not everybody has to do it it goes back and forth and it's like well then what is the

56:42.400 --> 56:47.680
point of this it's just a it's just like a slow control thing like TSA was born and so

56:47.680 --> 56:54.360
they came up with this fucking thing I hope they can fly on I hope that H&M and Banana

56:54.360 --> 56:57.320
Republic or whoever you were talking about don't maybe the next podcast Aaron will just

56:57.320 --> 57:02.600
be naked she's being boycotted by all the clothes they come to the house and take all my clothes

57:02.600 --> 57:09.600
the god damn it there was a there was a McKenna how are you doing over there I'm good yeah

57:10.960 --> 57:17.280
well how's your nightmare of being reliving all my airport experiences right now yeah not to

57:17.280 --> 57:22.520
harp on this topic but like like like look find this on YouTube there's an amazing uplifting

57:22.520 --> 57:29.080
video of these two kids who were handing out opt out flyers at an airport and it's like a it's

57:29.080 --> 57:34.200
not a short attention span thing like it's like a 40 minute video but you can like click

57:34.200 --> 57:39.280
through it like the the it's just these two kids are at an airport and they're standing

57:39.280 --> 57:43.720
at the top of the escalators before in the public area before you go through the machines

57:43.720 --> 57:48.600
and they're handing out flyers to raise awareness of like opt out day or something like that

57:48.600 --> 57:53.080
like you don't have to go through these machines if you don't want to and and the airport

57:53.080 --> 57:57.440
officials come up to them they're videotaping it and they start trying to bounce them and

57:57.440 --> 58:01.120
like they're using all the official language and you can't be here you can't be doing this

58:01.120 --> 58:06.280
you can't be distributing this literature and but and they bother to say I think we

58:06.280 --> 58:10.440
can I think we can stand here and talk to people and hand them literature we're in an

58:10.440 --> 58:14.800
airport you have people down there doing the same thing for some religion we were just

58:14.800 --> 58:19.960
doing the same thing and then they get increasingly aggressive and then they call the cops and

58:19.960 --> 58:25.640
this cop not an airport cop just a regular cop has to come and the regular cop is just

58:25.640 --> 58:30.240
this guy who refreshingly like he's kind of he's got the buzz cut and the gun belt and

58:30.240 --> 58:34.360
he just looks like any other cop that might do any horrible thing but he like kind of

58:34.360 --> 58:38.640
scratches his head and he walks away with the airport guy and he's like comes back to the

58:38.640 --> 58:45.480
people and he's like yeah I don't know I think the Constitution says you can do whatever

58:45.480 --> 58:51.960
you want they gave me a gun and a walkie-talkie I'm supposed to I think I'm supposed to just

58:51.960 --> 58:56.440
keep people safe I don't think I'm supposed to I think you're I think you have to and

58:56.440 --> 59:00.320
the airport guy is like what the fuck what's your fucking name I'm an airport guy I want

59:00.320 --> 59:05.600
an airport guy the same as when you try to return a sweater at Urban Outletters it's

59:05.600 --> 59:11.080
identical and I'm saying this I feel strongly about this because I worked at Urban Outletters

59:11.080 --> 59:19.240
and at Hot Topic yeah yeah really dark times but at Hot Topic the clothes are so cheap

59:19.240 --> 59:24.200
and I would have colleagues that would be like I don't know should we take this back

59:24.200 --> 59:29.560
should we should we accept it and I'm like yeah what we make $7 an hour what does this

59:29.560 --> 59:34.080
matter it doesn't matter sorry I'm all fired up I don't know I'm so fired up well it's

59:34.080 --> 59:38.520
the echoey chamber it makes you feel like you're in church it's that machine it's that

59:38.520 --> 59:41.680
machine in back it just makes you think of flashnets and how women have been exploited

59:41.680 --> 59:50.000
by disco movies the why don't we let's find the pain in the room in our new segment let's

59:50.000 --> 59:57.840

wedding it went poorly the was there okay sorry for the next two hours I was like was

01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:20.400
it was it birds attack you we'll figure it out eventually get there now so I recently

01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:28.040
like back in December as I moved from my hometown of Anchorage Alaska down to Seattle which is

01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:34.800
where I live now which is really far so you're following a hipster lay line you're gonna end

01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:40.800
up living at Stonehenge from Anchorage to Seattle to Portland he's gonna okay are you

01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:49.000
afraid of people without tattoos no like no no I'm sorry I love tattoos I just know that

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:53.760
Anchorage and Seattle and Portland all are famous for their beautiful tattoos and go

01:01:53.760 --> 01:02:01.320
ahead yeah no I did my my only thing is like I have a beard and have for sure do but it's

01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:08.520
utilitarian this is a guy sorry to interrupt but if Spencer's a brownie this guy's a blondie

01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:15.600
he's a Spencer type for the podcast listeners opposite coloring and looks the same he's

01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:21.760
a blondie he's a blonde Spencer okay continue yeah yeah so I moved beard utilitarian it

01:02:21.760 --> 01:02:27.920
was cold it was cold what's utilitarian about the beard it's really cold there because Alaska

01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:34.520
I was in I was in my hotel that's also as cold as Alaska and I was I was shirtless and I

01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:40.080
was trying to sleep and when I had my beard on my chest I was fine and when I swept it

01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:45.480
to the side I was freezing cold it's like an afghan for your neck it's like a blanket

01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:50.980
from your face and I heard in for the people in Ferguson are reporting it's a natural tear

01:02:50.980 --> 01:02:58.360
gas filter oh definitely just put it over your eyes yeah that it works it's just an adaptation

01:02:58.360 --> 01:03:03.440
we're all making it anyway I'll make this super brief I don't make you don't have to

01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:09.240
make it brief yeah don't worry about it this isn't desperate housewives it's a fuckin

01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:15.920
Portland podcast we want to hear your human stories I moved and had some really close

01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:21.320
friends I did podcast with and we were you know made a lot of stuff together and we were

01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:25.920
continuing to do it like kind of long distance because I was the only one who moved because

01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:31.800
I had to get out because it's the middle of nowhere yeah it yeah Alaska it's Cincinnati

01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:40.840
in the north no offense to Cincinnati they make wonderful chili the so I moved and and

01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:45.120
then came back in like May like six months later for the first time just for a weekend

01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:49.440
and we hung out and everything was great and then there was huge social drama because it

01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:58.600
turned out I had anchorage is a small town I had thrown your anchor into a seat I had

01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:05.840
I found anchorage I guess you could say in a port that ended up being all that's a really

01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:10.800
bad way to talk about a human being I'm taking that back immediately feel like we should

01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:17.760
commit to the party we all know women are at port we did like a major plot point and

01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:24.800
then you guys got derailed with this it was a short-term mortgage and then more it was

01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:31.480
very friendly and was very amicable and you know we were we were friends and then she

01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:37.080
started dating another friend in the close friend group and things kind of spiraled from

01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:40.600
there but it was the first time that like really close friends were kind of like alright

01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:46.520
no we're done so because did you become the the this is the thing that drives me insane

01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:51.440
about romance the the dirt underbelly of it that we see this is why I don't like romantic

01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:59.480
comedies but but because Aaron and Aaron loves them but I I I'm projecting like like I think

01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:03.320
that drives me insane my worst nightmare is being cast as the villain and someone else's

01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:07.640
story even though I didn't it's just like oh that's convenient for you like I'm the

01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:13.320
wind beneath your fucking wings because it's like taboo and not only was I the villain

01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:19.720
I was sour on on the proverbial mountain literally a country away you know like you

01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:24.560
had to go through Canada which is like I don't know Dwarf's live there or something and then

01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:29.320
there was me you know being all villainy and so you became a were you were you the other

01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:33.280
man ever no not at all this was before they got together but there were there were friends

01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:38.320
yeah yeah no one thinks about Alaska anyway for like and it's not too big a deal because

01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:42.920
yeah I don't need to go back I'm good for now like well I'll say you're you're an emotional

01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:47.720
pain you lost all your friends in a couple of days like you went from five to zero or

01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:54.320
whatever it is I don't mean to presume the numbers I would start with three but but but

01:05:54.320 --> 01:06:00.560
like he needs to hear more than fuck those friends you're right my mom always used to

01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:05.360
say when I would I would go out and I would get beat up by people and then I would come

01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:10.320
home and I would go Scott and so and so beat me up and my mom would go well so now you

01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:14.640
know you don't like those guys right you know like and here they are wanting to beat you

01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:19.360
up so some problems solve themselves and you have to see them every day like that and

01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:23.560
that's the part that's still raw is because of the internet which is a great thing in

01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:30.880
so many ways were just kind of one Kevin Bacon away from each other yeah you know and have

01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:35.120
a whole bunch of mutual friends so like it's there's only so much hiding and blocking

01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:39.480
and muting that you can do did they break break up with you via like an email or some kind

01:06:39.480 --> 01:06:44.120
of conversation no it was like hey I'm back in town for three days three days everything's

01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:50.560
cool one day the next day oh by the way podcast listeners it was right he's flipping off you

01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:56.000
give him double birds without really knowing the situation I would I would say to not really

01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:00.680
take that too personally if you really believe that you weren't in the wrong yeah don't worry

01:07:00.680 --> 01:07:07.120
about it you've moved so it's not really about you it's like they're they're like look who's

01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:11.960
in the Anchorage crew well it sounds like they're resentful that you've got out right I mean

01:07:11.960 --> 01:07:17.540
right maybe I'd imagine that it sucks for agreement all that I mean am I hearing a different

01:07:17.540 --> 01:07:21.200
thing I mean he doesn't he's not he's not wondering whether or not he should like these

01:07:21.200 --> 01:07:27.640
people he is saying it hurt you know it like is a wound that it's like Allen and it's just

01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:32.160
sitting there so what's the staff that you put on it it won't heal it the thing that

01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:37.800
will heal it is his own body and time but is there like some some Neosporin that we could

01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:42.800
squirt on it in the morning reminding myself if I was in his position reminding myself

01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:46.920
that it wasn't really about me it would be that Neosporin which is why I said that right

01:07:46.920 --> 01:07:50.960
definitely I wasn't and I my god I wasn't arguing with you oh Jesus you guys shouldn't

01:07:50.960 --> 01:07:59.160
be therapists at all if there's a couple therapists important practice called mixed nuts I mean

01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:03.520
I think the first thing we need to do not to be Geraldo Rivera about it but I gotta reach

01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:08.560
around I'm like Kelly McGillis and Top Gun and just embrace him and you can't see it

01:08:08.560 --> 01:08:13.920
on the podcast it's not it's not for it's not for applause but thank you how does it

01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:22.880
feel to be to be touched and held by someone you admire who will never betray you I don't

01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:32.840
care I don't care who you who you date next I'm never gonna touch her I'm every time you

01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:40.520
hear my voice I'm talking to you praise Jesus I'm very sorry that happened to you and these

01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:45.320
moments of pain I like to quote one of my favorite shows a little time my so-called

01:08:45.320 --> 01:08:54.600
life I would reference an episode halfway through the series where Claire is getting

01:08:54.600 --> 01:09:00.800
over Jordan and realizes that she's over him and she says you know what it hurts until

01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:09.120
it doesn't it hurts until it doesn't that's still that just seems like such a fuck off

01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:14.320
like no it's not it's not a fuck I mean the the meaning that is like no like if you feel

01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:17.400
sad about this your feelings are valid and you're gonna sit in them but you won't feel

01:09:17.400 --> 01:09:25.640
that way forever it'll it'll expire it hurts until it doesn't what if it hurts forever

01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:28.240
well then there's something wrong with you and you should jump off and then you die and

01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:33.440
it doesn't hurt anymore what if you know that it makes me feel a lot better you just die

01:09:33.440 --> 01:09:38.920
and you're fine what if you're so smart what if you're so smart then it's not about that

01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:43.400
situation what if you're so smart that you know that about pain and it doesn't change

01:09:43.400 --> 01:09:48.760
anything what if what if what if what do you do in those moments when knowing how your

01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:52.600
brain works and how your heart works doesn't change anything that's going on in them what

01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:57.880
do you what do you is there is there a technique is there a you go you go inside you gotta you

01:09:57.880 --> 01:10:03.200
gotta go inside get out of the sun get out of orange Hitler your emotions are a lot like

01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:07.200
weather they come and go and sometimes they make sense and follow patterns and other times

01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:12.720
it's like a freak storm it's like you go inside or you had a friend who suggested he

01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:17.800
got over a breakup he watched all the seasons of Farscape oh that sounds awesome I mean

01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:22.800
the thing is it's it's not a that's the thing is that like it's it's a tired expression

01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:30.160
but it's in a dumb old adage but time really does heal all wounds the good news about being

01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:36.800
sad is that in times when you're sad art is better music is better probably more creative

01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:41.560
you're seeing things differently like you're really living because you have you're bleeding

01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:46.120
from your soul as you're walking around like that's a good news but news is again it's

01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:50.760
gonna feel bad until it doesn't feel bad anymore that's just that's just time what

01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:57.720
a bad thing to do is to try to fix it by a fucking you know doing like putting a building

01:10:57.720 --> 01:11:02.360
a windmill or whatever crazy thing you would do talking about it on a podcast in front

01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:05.760
of yeah well I don't I don't think Seth's the type of guy that's gonna do anything he's

01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:12.080
gonna I mean by the way what you have he's gonna do great things no I said I was saying

01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:16.160
I don't think he's gonna do anything that's like unhealthy with pain if he's willing to

01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:20.800
like cry it out from an audience at a podcast that means he's already actually like he's

01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:26.760
got oxygen and that's gonna heal but Seth do you do you ever listen to this podcast

01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:30.720
do you think it would help you heal a little bit to play a character that you whose life

01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:37.160
you had more control over in a game of Dungeons and Dragons maybe whose wounds could not hurt

01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:45.680
you no matter who did anything to you so do you think I don't know how we got a smattering

01:11:45.680 --> 01:11:49.680
of applause when we asked who listened to the podcast so but the thing is during the

01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:57.600
podcast we end it by playing a round of Dungeons and Dragons on the podcast so I guess if you're

01:11:57.600 --> 01:12:06.360
not a fan fuck off I guess but not in a mean way just in a you won't maybe not know what's

01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:12.240
going on or if you're a gaming fan I mean this is a big like tabletop intensive conference

01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:19.520
so we're gonna be we have an ongoing campaign that we play and we need a Chris de Burgh who

01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:26.040
will be Seth and we need a if McKenna would be willing to be wait so we have what I'm

01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:33.320
sorry we need a quark and you'll play Chris de Burgh sorry McKenna okay you get the character

01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:38.560
sheets so yeah let me just bust these out real quick all right while he's busting those

01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:47.240
out keep being comedic Aaron did you want to read the list of I mean this is just a shout

01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:53.520
out to do you guys know who Rob Schrabitz be somebody who's on the podcast that's eight

01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:59.960
people do you have your yeah maybe I'm looking ahead and I'm going like you know what it's

01:12:59.960 --> 01:13:06.840
not the best in Marshall's technology corner doesn't doesn't explain to us earlier that

01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:13.720
if you pay attention to the size of cell phones it appears that their size changes over time

01:13:13.720 --> 01:13:18.480
based on people's needs and that that's similar to evolution and we started mocking him for

01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:24.400
that revelation if you need a time filler I can pull up my phone I have this great treatment

01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:33.280
for Alan Alda plays a where is that guy is that guy here is the guy here that read the

01:13:33.280 --> 01:13:39.320
treatment are you do you do you are you did I humiliate you did I make you feel bad by

01:13:39.320 --> 01:13:44.360
telling that story okay do you want can I turn it can I turn it into a win for you do you

01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:52.560
want to read your treatment to the people or anything you want like like for real like

01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:57.960
like you know I don't I'm not I'm not bullying you like I don't want I don't if you're actually

01:13:57.960 --> 01:14:01.600
worried that you would read it and then people go I'm going to rip that off like but or do

01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:06.840
you just want to talk about it for a second okay all right I just want to humanize you

01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:13.000
for them I don't want the moral of the story to be the people are bad I want to be I want

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:17.880
to be that there are heroes among us I love it what's your name Jason Jason all right

01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:23.320
Jason's the guy who read me a treatment off his phone at the cooler of us I felt so bad

01:14:23.320 --> 01:14:25.520
it's the weirdest thing I've ever done I wasn't that annoyed I just thought it was

01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:32.400
remarkable actually I actually canceled my D&D night tonight to be here so god all right

01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:39.720
what do you what do you play what do you play as in D&D on the mic I don't eat the

01:14:39.720 --> 01:14:44.520
warlock for a while right now I'm a paladin so I got you know that's exciting Gilman

01:14:44.520 --> 01:14:50.400
the Toronto yeah it's kind of getting old no it sounds great David Cross as a family

01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:55.720
man can we let's reenact the encounter so like imagine a black and white strobing thing

01:14:55.720 --> 01:15:01.720
like from a crime show yeah like okay we're we're we're look alike actors so like David

01:15:01.720 --> 01:15:08.440
do companies playing me and so I'm just let's just reenact okay I'm by the cooler okay Dan

01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:13.120
this is the only time this is going to happen but I have to do it now okay so David Cross

01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:18.120
is a put-upon family man and a super scientist he works at the Enlightenment Corporation

01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:22.040
and tests the Bodhisattva chair an electric chair that blasts people into enlightenment

01:15:22.040 --> 01:15:26.240
for science father of three his wife Jane keeps things kosher at home while wielding

01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:33.240
a gigantic hook for a hand doesn't sound that bad sounds great all right thank you sir

01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:39.760
what's your name again sorry Jason Jason everybody the David Cross treatment writer I

01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:46.640
know David Cross will we'll get that to him but I don't think he makes those decisions

01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:49.560
I think David Cross probably has an agent he's like does anyone want to hire me and

01:15:49.560 --> 01:15:56.240
then they go like oh the guy wants you to play a robot all right so you got the character

01:15:56.240 --> 01:16:04.840
sheets ready yeah let me just let me give that to you give that to Aaron and then the

01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:10.960
top ones for my camera and the rest is yours take for Spencer as comptroller I mean let's

01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:19.960
go great that's that's about what I deserve it's very apt appropriate I appreciate it

01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:28.280
I mean now it's getting now it's getting dishonest now it's not buying it anymore there's a lot

01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:33.480
more believable before so thank you that's what I'm looking for that's what I need right

01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:38.840
now are you guys ready should I should I start this up yeah let's do it I don't have my D&D

01:16:38.840 --> 01:16:43.920
music so I'm just gonna play that warm-up music from earlier it'll really do you want

01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:54.240
to hum it I think that would be better actually when we last met our heroes had landed in

01:16:54.240 --> 01:17:01.200
some pretty hot water after a late night juice tour gonna ride the party retired with Spis

01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:06.560
Bulb the friendly gnome where they decided to break into the priest's juicery to look

01:17:06.560 --> 01:17:13.200
for clues don't become while inside the juicery the gang heard a noise and arrived to see a

01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:19.160
beaten father tinder and escaping assailant Sharpie tracked down the would-be murderer

01:17:19.160 --> 01:17:26.160
to the Darvon household and what he found wasn't pretty Darvon and her son were murdered

01:17:26.160 --> 01:17:34.240
dead home there Sharpie and the gang encountered the assassin Spis Bulb the gnome the little

01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:39.360
gnome cast powerful nap magics and hurled insults but something wasn't light right

01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:45.560
bone blows were exchanged but using his shrewd mind Christopher determined that Spis Bulb

01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:52.200
wasn't at posture convincing their cast attacker to cast off his disguise revealing himself

01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:59.440
to be none other than father tinder himself working together the gang started to gain

01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:03.800
the upper hand breaking through his shield while quarks slash tinder's head with a flaming

01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:10.040
sword as the old man like dying white be white beams of light began streaming through the

01:18:10.040 --> 01:18:15.680
room as the shard of power worked its ancient and hideous magic but what danger could the

01:18:15.680 --> 01:18:26.960
shark portend what new evils must the gang face what tricks were still in the way up

01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:42.160
father tinder's sleeve find out now that was some great humming I want to buy that album

01:18:42.160 --> 01:18:47.480
I assume the effect is the same as in the shower but it sounded awesome to me I think

01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:53.400
when we listen to the podcast will be like oh my god stop groaning into the microphone

01:18:53.400 --> 01:18:59.600
so traditionally you guys have a lot of questions at this point I was humming yeah I was listening

01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:06.200
I was humming that's what I'm saying so just in a moment where am I standing you guys are

01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:11.640
all standing together in the broken remnants of the Darvon household you see crumbling stone

01:19:11.640 --> 01:19:17.520
falling from the ceiling and all the furniture in the room is destroyed reduced to splinters

01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:23.160
everything is very hard to see because white light is dazzling you going throughout the

01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:30.000
room before it concentrates onto a single glowing humanoid form the form of father tinder he

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:37.360
starts to transform before you into an eight feet tall gray skinned stone skinned bullhorned

01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:44.720
man with glowing red eyes powerful muscular limbs and stony wings a burning white flame

01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:53.360
grows brightly in his chest and he looks not unlike a winged demon or something hi

01:19:53.360 --> 01:20:00.840
do you have more questions we're probably cool now right now that he's transformed into

01:20:00.840 --> 01:20:07.040
this thing are you asking me or are you asking him I'm kind of thinking out loud okay continue

01:20:07.040 --> 01:20:19.040
and I've I've worked for him for many a moon and a sunset for sunset 20 moon who are you

01:20:19.040 --> 01:20:27.440
I'm father tinder I have transformed into my final form like that lady at the drive-through

01:20:27.440 --> 01:20:36.760
in the video yeah but I'm getting all the chicken nuggets is your now that you've transformed

01:20:36.760 --> 01:20:41.160
into your final form you're probably really self-actualized and all your aggression is

01:20:41.160 --> 01:20:49.640
gone right you could say that yes but I'll still need to destroy you can I mean we could

01:20:49.640 --> 01:20:59.440
talk about that we could while I'm destroying you all right I'm gonna run I'd like to run

01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:06.800
what do you guys we're standing there and this guy turned into a demon and he's gonna

01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:13.200
kill us do you guys have any he's a glowy white spot in the middle of his chest yeah I you

01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:17.000
know this isn't my first rodeo with gamey things usually the place you want to throw

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:21.800
a sword or something okay well I mean this isn't my first rodeo but do you really want

01:21:21.800 --> 01:21:29.280
to throw your swords it's more of a Castlevania type you know there's there's a lot of platformers

01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:33.480
from the old days barbarian not thinking things through very well it's good characterization

01:21:33.480 --> 01:21:37.640
all right I'm bolstered by your confidence you think this is as easy as a boss battle

01:21:37.640 --> 01:21:48.120
in a video game well I'll attack his milky white spot all right I I'm not a D&D player

01:21:48.120 --> 01:21:55.440
but in my gear I have a dragon dick so yeah I feel like that might work in this situation

01:21:55.440 --> 01:22:01.240
it's more of a trophy I mean I think I think I remember where you got that I don't know

01:22:01.240 --> 01:22:08.360
if it's a weapon it's something that it's a conversation piece most things are a weapon

01:22:08.360 --> 01:22:16.000
against a milky white spot whose turn is it first I guess I want to put it at a quark's

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:21.600
turn how about that's Seth there oh Seth okay well let's go ahead and use a power attack

01:22:21.600 --> 01:22:27.080
all right that's going to be less accurate than a normal attack I'm afraid and yet you

01:22:27.080 --> 01:22:39.480
hit him dropping anchor rushing towards your demonic foe you plunge your sword deep into

01:22:39.480 --> 01:22:50.720
his side dealing 12 damage and that's not even the milky white spot sure I'm excited

01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:56.600
yeah we're having a great time we can do this yeah we are doing this yeah we're it's gone

01:22:56.600 --> 01:23:04.200
really well no I'm excited well it was let's put it at a McKenna's turn that's a Krista

01:23:04.200 --> 01:23:13.560
Berg right yes apparently it is so yeah you got your dragon dick let's do this

01:23:13.560 --> 01:23:30.120
street style feel free to ask questions I may need some help on this yeah it occurs to

01:23:30.120 --> 01:23:35.480
me we're subjecting her to quite a quite a lot yeah no I don't even I don't know half

01:23:35.480 --> 01:23:46.840
of this all right I'm gonna attempt to use a short bow no no you're gonna use I'm going

01:23:46.840 --> 01:23:55.400
to I'm gonna fucking shoot that short bow in I'm shooting it into the milky white spot

01:23:55.400 --> 01:24:04.520
yes yes firing an arrow at his milky white spot it was probably it might have been your

01:24:04.520 --> 01:24:12.600
income your what is the lack of confidence lack of confidence or something but your arrow

01:24:12.600 --> 01:24:19.160
misses its mark plunging deep into the cobblestone walls of the dwelling it's okay he knows

01:24:19.160 --> 01:24:27.640
we mean business yeah the communication shot so let's put it at a dignity that's Aaron

01:24:27.640 --> 01:24:44.280
all right uh foe uh yeah unworthy foe who has been deceitful and untrue going to throw

01:24:44.280 --> 01:24:50.040
my axe and it's going to be the death of you I rhyme now I guess I rhyme now so I throw

01:24:50.040 --> 01:24:59.880
my I'm gonna throw my axe and I throw it really hard at the middle of his face you do that

01:24:59.880 --> 01:25:04.920
but it doesn't hit him in the middle of his face but instead in his shoulder dealing

01:25:04.920 --> 01:25:16.520
well what's your strength this plus three eight damage all right yeah the axe protrudes

01:25:16.520 --> 01:25:24.200
from his shoulder it's not a joke I'd like to shoot a fireball at his milky white spot

01:25:25.720 --> 01:25:30.360
all right casting your arms in a magical manner you unleash a fireball directly

01:25:30.360 --> 01:25:35.560
towards his milky white spot he attempts to dodge out of the way but is too sluggish

01:25:35.560 --> 01:25:39.960
and it hits him right in the chest but not his milky white spot like the nipple right next to

01:25:39.960 --> 01:25:49.240
it instead but a nice grouping as they say in darts very tinky d&d is I guess there are dragon

01:25:49.240 --> 01:25:57.640
dicks and milky white semen all this stuff there was no semen but now there is Portland

01:25:57.640 --> 01:26:06.200
most strip clubs in the world right per capita love hearing about it most vegan strip clubs is that

01:26:06.200 --> 01:26:19.880
what you said we'll talk after dealing 17 damage all right all right and that's just the nipple

01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:28.520
I shout out the milky white spot it's the way to go so he turns his eyes to you the wizard

01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:33.960
who's casted all this magic sand he beats his powerful wings and lunges at you through the

01:26:33.960 --> 01:26:41.560
air his claws outstretched reaching right towards your neck that's my milky white spot

01:26:41.560 --> 01:26:50.040
but he grabs you by the throat dealing nine damage and holding you fast in his sharp rocky

01:26:50.040 --> 01:26:57.480
claw all right can I is it possible for me to go out of turn and use diplomacy no afraid not

01:26:58.120 --> 01:27:06.120
but you could do it in your own turn thank you which is only three turns away putting it at

01:27:06.120 --> 01:27:21.640
Seth's turn I appear to have some yarn you sure do I just thought it's funny because it's right

01:27:21.640 --> 01:27:28.680
next to the nut sack I thought he got rid of that nut sack it is it has not yet been combined

01:27:28.680 --> 01:27:36.440
with the dragon dick take a moment and say how much joy it is for me to hear that quirk is about

01:27:36.440 --> 01:27:44.680
to use yarn very happy moment actually I also what's a cactus card that's like a business card

01:27:44.680 --> 01:27:50.600
that says cactus club or bunch cactus bunch oh right right buy one get one free and also a

01:27:50.600 --> 01:27:59.720
strange painted stick is there any more information about that at all it's strangely painted in a stick

01:27:59.720 --> 01:28:12.840
so no um so that I do not hit my compatriot who is being held by the demon correct uh I mean

01:28:12.840 --> 01:28:18.440
what are you trying to do I'm trying to attack but not oh you know cleave someone in half in the

01:28:18.440 --> 01:28:26.520
who isn't white spot guy taking careful uh attention not to hurt your ally thank you slice

01:28:26.520 --> 01:28:33.320
with your sword at the demonic foe before you got a hug so but uh you were you were too considerate

01:28:33.320 --> 01:28:39.240
and you go way wide and don't hit anything at all you know just some advice it hurts until it

01:28:39.240 --> 01:29:01.640
doesn't um a post it tells me I have a robot baby is oh yeah is there any use to the robot

01:29:01.640 --> 01:29:07.400
baby uh I mean there's tons of uses I don't think you know any of them let's uh probably not it's

01:29:07.400 --> 01:29:13.000
heavy you could hit someone with it maybe or you could tell it something give it a command give the

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:21.400
robot baby a command what was that tell the robot baby give it a command maybe it'll oh so if I

01:29:21.400 --> 01:29:31.240
tell the robot baby to like infiltrate the milky white spot and retrieve whatever's inside

01:29:31.240 --> 01:29:39.480
I can attempt that you can't yeah definitely I'm gonna I'm gonna do that all right say it

01:29:39.480 --> 01:29:47.800
say it to the baby baby go to the milky white spot like you mean it McKenna yes go inside of it

01:29:48.440 --> 01:29:55.480
like you know the baby's going to do it take hold of the milky white spot and bring it to me

01:29:55.480 --> 01:30:08.280
uh you say those things and the robot baby's like all right yeah he starts wobbling over

01:30:08.280 --> 01:30:14.360
toward uh towards the giant demon thing it's uh he's he's getting over there the demon doesn't

01:30:14.360 --> 01:30:18.760
seem too occupied probably because it's a robot baby and he starts climbing up his leg but it's

01:30:18.760 --> 01:30:24.840
gonna take some time before he can actually infiltrate the milky white spot for some reason he

01:30:24.840 --> 01:30:31.480
doesn't seem to notice the robot baby it's a weird it's a weird phenomenon okay so then because I

01:30:31.480 --> 01:30:38.840
know the robot baby is approaching the milky white spot I use diplomacy and I look at father

01:30:38.840 --> 01:30:51.640
tinder and say father tinder uh-huh can we it's just the sounds of portland there's there's trains

01:30:51.640 --> 01:30:56.360
there's five thousand people outside I thought I thought I was hearing my demons for a second

01:30:56.360 --> 01:31:06.120
father father tinder uh one moment can you just look at my face for a second because I'm going

01:31:06.120 --> 01:31:13.640
to explain to you why you are such a great leader but I'm using my diplomacy which is basically

01:31:14.920 --> 01:31:20.520
if no yes I'm lying yeah you can't use diplomacy for lying oh I can't okay thank you okay

01:31:20.520 --> 01:31:27.960
father tinder you look like a piece of shit father tinder this final this final thing that you've

01:31:27.960 --> 01:31:33.880
turned into is no good no one likes it you have no friends you're going to defeat us and then

01:31:33.880 --> 01:31:43.720
you're going to be all alone so stay still for a moment because I want you to I really want you

01:31:43.720 --> 01:31:54.760
to stay still it's my heart's desire that you do not look anywhere but into my eyes he he glares

01:31:54.760 --> 01:31:59.800
at you with his red eyes and he looks he looks like he's looking directly through you and through

01:31:59.800 --> 01:32:04.920
your soul and he's like I don't know what you're getting at but I feel like I'm trying to I feel

01:32:04.920 --> 01:32:11.400
like I'm being manipulated here I'm not gonna do that I'm gonna start looking around continuously

01:32:11.400 --> 01:32:18.600
for the rest of the turn where's the what's the status on the baby the baby's still working around

01:32:18.600 --> 01:32:32.040
he's you know okay he's met the resistance that was my turn right uh I mean you could do a short

01:32:32.040 --> 01:32:40.520
action because you only said some words okay so I take a I take a sword and I I try to stab his

01:32:40.520 --> 01:32:49.240
foot so I peg him to the ground all right like a like taxidermy like a moth you stab at his foot

01:32:49.240 --> 01:32:53.400
and it uh it doesn't pin him to the ground but it does hurt him somewhat what'd you stab him with

01:32:53.400 --> 01:33:00.360
a sword I did I stabbed him with a sword those are sharp it deals 11 damage to his foot all right

01:33:02.520 --> 01:33:07.880
that's good I clapped my hands like I finished a job and I spit on the ground and twirl like

01:33:07.880 --> 01:33:14.760
mighty mouse that might just stop your hands yeah exactly is that actually happening yeah that

01:33:14.760 --> 01:33:20.600
happens okay okay just making sure yeah all right and then I say let's all journey towards truth

01:33:21.320 --> 01:33:29.320
and then I sit down on the ground and I regret everything I just said putting it at the sharpies

01:33:29.320 --> 01:33:35.880
turn all right lightning bolt at the milky white spot it's not the first time I've said it I feel

01:33:35.880 --> 01:33:41.720
like okay I'm gonna say that after this you're out of spells of the third level because that

01:33:41.720 --> 01:33:48.760
sounds like all you're cutting me off well yeah you only have so many I mean I think when's the

01:33:48.760 --> 01:33:53.480
last time you heard me cast a lightning bolt you've only you cast three level this is exciting

01:33:53.480 --> 01:34:00.360
you've cast three level three spells I can quit anytime I want I don't have a problem

01:34:00.360 --> 01:34:06.840
you cast your arms in a magical manner and pointing your lightning finger towards them you

01:34:06.840 --> 01:34:13.480
unleash a torrent a bolt a bolt of lightning a bolt of lightning but because he's not heating

01:34:13.480 --> 01:34:19.080
a dignity's advice and looking all around he finds it very easy to see it coming and he dodges

01:34:19.080 --> 01:34:24.200
out of the way that dumb I mean I don't want to I don't want to tell you your job but I could

01:34:24.200 --> 01:34:30.280
explain it in a different way if you'd prefer no you just did such a shitty job that he dodged

01:34:30.280 --> 01:34:38.040
his out of the way you're a terrible wizard you're a bad friend you're a bad friend it's gonna hurt

01:34:38.040 --> 01:34:46.120

01:35:00.200 --> 01:35:06.440
starts squeezing on Sharpie harder Jesus Christ oh he he fails at that though it's like a it's like

01:35:06.440 --> 01:35:11.960
a neck massage or something I don't want to I don't want to be one of those characters in the

01:38:35.880 --> 01:38:46.120
of gumption I love it put it at a dignity I I take out my lance and I charge towards

01:38:47.480 --> 01:38:55.080
father tinder and I aim directly between his eyes which I know I've done before but now it's

01:38:55.080 --> 01:39:08.680
with a different weapon here I come good over evil all praise to strusher sister Russia because

01:39:08.680 --> 01:39:16.760
he's blind you charge directly into him and you hit him right in the forehead his his head skin

01:39:16.760 --> 01:39:22.440
that's made of stone it cracks and several chips fall off and he's got a kind of a dark hole in

01:39:22.440 --> 01:39:27.560
his head now but he doesn't react like a human would to having his head impaled in that he's still

01:39:27.560 --> 01:39:35.560
alive he does how are what's the damage on that sorry this is uh it's like 80 come on man no I'm

01:39:58.680 --> 01:40:05.560
impacts him and he drops uh he drops sharpie in the scuffle all right see I did that for you

01:40:05.560 --> 01:40:11.880
thank you let's put it at your turn all right so you said now you took all my spells away

01:40:11.880 --> 01:40:17.160
no just the third level ones all right you have less of them than any other spells you command

01:40:18.520 --> 01:40:23.400
well so shocking grasp is a level one spell yeah and I'm right there with them

01:40:24.360 --> 01:40:32.200
I just grab them and I I whisper in his ear I I don't I mean this is for Kevin which means

01:40:32.200 --> 01:40:38.760
nothing but I want it to freak him out and I shock and grasp him this is for Kevin

01:40:38.760 --> 01:40:41.960
I know what you did to Kevin

01:40:44.360 --> 01:40:51.080
blinded and confused by your strange words you find it not difficult at all to uh to grasp him

01:40:51.080 --> 01:40:58.600
shockingly and lightning surges through his body it crackles and burns it it the fact his skin

01:40:58.600 --> 01:41:04.360
is made of stone seems to make it not affect him so much but it still deals seven damage

01:41:04.360 --> 01:41:11.800
yeah now don't applaud don't I fucked up he's made of stone if he was made of copper

01:41:11.800 --> 01:41:17.160
that would have been a bold move we're made of tinder portland you're better than that

01:41:17.160 --> 01:41:22.840
don't applaud shocking grasp on a stone guy I'm sorry I let you down I let your city down

01:41:24.360 --> 01:41:29.720
all right so uh father tinder he takes a couple steps back and he starts rubbing his eyes uh

01:41:29.720 --> 01:41:36.440
he starts rubbing his eyes and he can see again for once he takes his large uh rocky claws and

01:41:36.440 --> 01:41:42.200
he lifts them up in the air and you see several spikes made out of white energy coalesce in the

01:41:42.200 --> 01:41:49.080
sky like icicles and start falling all around the area so uh god he's holly berry in what

01:41:49.960 --> 01:41:57.960

01:43:27.880 --> 01:43:34.040
four spikes are too much and you take uh well let's see here quark takes three damage uh

Chris de Burgh takes five and you two take eight okay it's not i reject that well i mean you still

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:52.600

creatures what do you think would defeat a stone creature you know stone hates dynamite

01:43:59.160 --> 01:44:05.880
i think that's the kryptonite for i mean we all grew up with that phrase but come on give me some

01:44:05.880 --> 01:44:14.520
good advice i'm not sure i uh what anybody out there ever played stone creatures paper paper

01:44:14.520 --> 01:44:24.280
i'm hearing a lot of paper of course what wait sit pickaxe that's right like a diamond pickaxe

01:44:24.280 --> 01:44:33.000
would definitely go through this like butter earthquakes water water water why is good erosion

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:37.320
i like way i do you have like like like slogan with water and then freezing it

01:44:38.200 --> 01:44:43.320
cracking well i i have the ability of creating water it's not my turn but i'm gonna get back

01:44:43.320 --> 01:44:47.480
around are you speaking as the character or yes i'm telling me a new thing

01:44:47.480 --> 01:44:59.640
uh i can create water i can wash away our trials and tribulations if you created water and then i

01:44:59.640 --> 01:45:08.120

charm some stuff or things some stuff i mean probably tinder tinder guy it's been so long

01:45:32.120 --> 01:45:36.760
since you've played your loot of charming it's quite out of tune and the sounds you make are

01:45:36.760 --> 01:45:47.800
rather discordant and not charming uh he's not charmed he's not charmed sorry i rolled a three

01:45:48.760 --> 01:45:56.440
so let's put it at Chris de Burgh's turn all right since there's a nice hole in his head

01:45:57.400 --> 01:46:04.200
i happen to have a climbing kit with 150 feet of rope so i'm going to use the climbing kit to

01:46:04.200 --> 01:46:15.240
climb up him using the hole in his head and hold out my hands hoping to use um some water and

01:46:15.240 --> 01:46:21.640

for the future what's up the baby's turn is right after hers so the baby continues reaching around

01:46:44.600 --> 01:46:53.080
in the milky white void and what he finds may disturb you uh oh he he pulls out his arm from

01:46:53.080 --> 01:46:59.320
the white portal with a pop except uh he doesn't instead of an arm there is no arm it's completely

01:46:59.320 --> 01:47:05.880

down in portland season one of breaking bad spoilers they're not quite time warner hasn't

01:47:59.880 --> 01:48:05.560

01:48:05.560 --> 01:48:11.080
like they like they like they like the golden age of television they like storytelling that's what i got

01:48:11.080 --> 01:48:19.400
from that you know in the wire in the wire at the uh drug dealers when i use uh create water

01:48:20.760 --> 01:48:34.760
i single clap i uh i create water and i say as sustrasia has created life before i shall create

01:48:34.760 --> 01:48:39.400
water for your death

01:48:39.400 --> 01:49:04.040
oh it's like the cranberries

01:49:04.040 --> 01:49:10.280
uh it's too oh it's too oh what does it mean to mean about me that i'm very turned on by you

01:49:10.280 --> 01:49:18.200
doing that impression all right yeah so i create water i try i try to create water all right with

01:49:18.200 --> 01:49:25.400
Chris de Burgh writing a top father tender and holding his head open you pour your created water directly

01:49:25.400 --> 01:49:37.800
into his head void it's too oh it's too oh trickles start to pour out of his mouth and his eyes

01:49:42.920 --> 01:49:52.360
she turned on for the stage all right yeah sorry that happens so uh sharpie uh i i i just leave

01:49:52.360 --> 01:50:00.520
i'm gonna go look into some real estate you find several great offers but i want to check the water

01:50:00.520 --> 01:50:07.400
pressure on every shower head the water pressures are uh optimal oh shit well what i mean is this a

01:50:07.400 --> 01:50:26.520
uh i cast no heating units i cast frozen i cast a dvd of frozen uh she's a role model

01:50:26.520 --> 01:50:33.240
no women but when she gets empowered she has high heels on the slit skirt uh i i i cast

01:50:33.240 --> 01:50:37.960
ray of fraud it's fine also that's a post feminist world you can also be empowered by

01:50:37.960 --> 01:50:43.560
looking the way you want in your frozen castle frozen frozen yeah you know she goes like let it

01:50:43.560 --> 01:50:47.080
go and she's like i'm letting it go i'm like you're letting it go those shoes look really

01:50:47.080 --> 01:50:55.960
uncomfortable you made them but it's that's fine too um i i cast ray of frosts on the uh

01:50:55.960 --> 01:51:04.280
on the on the watery water filled head wound this is a globetrotters move we all work together

01:51:04.280 --> 01:51:09.800
yeah this is going to be amazing you do those things and you fire off a ray of frost it hits

01:51:09.800 --> 01:51:19.080
right in his uh face crack it's called a head no he has a crack in his face all right you hear

01:51:19.080 --> 01:51:26.680
the crackling of ice freezing over as uh the void in his head becomes occupied by white ice

01:51:28.840 --> 01:51:33.240
so at this point i think it would be uh Chris de Burgh's turn right because you've been holding

01:51:33.240 --> 01:51:39.640
your action until this this happens i thought this was what you wanted

01:51:41.400 --> 01:51:45.400
don't forget about your nightmare of doing things wrong in front of a group of people

01:51:45.400 --> 01:51:53.880
well i've still got arrows for my short bow so i'm going to attempt to just show the attempt

01:51:54.440 --> 01:52:03.640
i'm just i'm gonna fucking shove yes of an arrow through that ice all right crack that

01:52:03.640 --> 01:52:11.320
fucking rock open awesome that's how they do it on sam and street that's how we roll

01:52:11.320 --> 01:52:19.640
all shoving your fucking arrows into his facial cracks the arrows pierced through the ice and

01:52:19.640 --> 01:52:27.000
you give an expert twist and the entire rocky head explodes crumbling into fragments

01:52:33.480 --> 01:52:40.840
it's a northwest paradise it's the los angeles of the of the of the upper part of uh this day
