{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:10.000\nFrom Meltdown Comics, Hollywood, California, Harmontown is now in session.\n\n00:10.000 --> 00:20.000\nPlease welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.\n\n00:20.000 --> 00:24.000\nThank you.\n\n00:24.000 --> 00:31.000\nThank you very much. Very enthusiastic. Very good people.\n\n00:31.000 --> 00:34.000\nThank you for not going to the Grammys. Thank you so much.\n\n00:34.000 --> 00:40.000\nI know a lot of you are nominated and you just decided to check the results later.\n\n00:40.000 --> 00:45.000\nYeah, I got my eye-harmed back. Aaron made me a quickie for a shadow run tonight.\n\n00:45.000 --> 00:49.000\nWe haven't figured out. I don't want to talk about that.\n\n00:49.000 --> 01:01.000\nWe haven't figured out how to make these devices in our pockets usable on the level of a notepad yet.\n\n01:01.000 --> 01:05.000\nIt still hasn't happened. I'm 42 fucking years old. That's all I'm going to say about it.\n\n01:05.000 --> 01:11.000\nIt's still easier to have a piece of paper around your neck. It shouldn't be.\n\n01:11.000 --> 01:21.000\nAt the peak of the Palm Trio, I remember I was typing really fast with my thumbs.\n\n01:21.000 --> 01:26.000\nThen this iPhone thing happened. It's wonderful. It's a great looking thing.\n\n01:26.000 --> 01:28.000\nYou can touch the screen and move it around.\n\n01:28.000 --> 01:34.000\nBut if you add it up all of the time that we spend going back and correcting all the words,\n\n01:34.000 --> 01:44.000\nboy, Jeff, second life. Did any extra black people come tonight?\n\n01:44.000 --> 01:54.000\nWhat's your name, sir? Brian? Anybody else?\n\n01:54.000 --> 02:02.000\nYou better not be white. You better be genuinely black. That's only funny if you're black.\n\n02:02.000 --> 02:06.000\nNo, it's funny both ways. No, it's not. It's not funny if he's white.\n\n02:06.000 --> 02:09.000\nIt's hilarious if he's white. No, it's not.\n\n02:09.000 --> 02:12.000\nImagine if Jim Belushi is doing that in the back. That's not funny.\n\n02:12.000 --> 02:21.000\nHe's doing a black guy impression. It's funny if it's tiny Lister Jr.\n\n02:21.000 --> 02:25.000\nThere's no middle ground between those? No, there's lots of middle ground.\n\n02:25.000 --> 02:31.000\nIt's also funny if it's just any black guy. What is your name back there? Max?\n\n02:31.000 --> 02:42.000\nAre you in the military at some point with the yes sir or no?\n\n02:42.000 --> 02:46.000\nSee now, it's way funny if that guy's white.\n\n02:46.000 --> 02:52.000\nIt's starting to get okay if he's white. Because it's a dimensionalized character.\n\n02:52.000 --> 02:57.000\nIt's not just an impression of a race. It's becoming a character.\n\n02:57.000 --> 03:08.000\nSo it's becoming fine. He's becoming Tracy Oldman if he's white.\n\n03:08.000 --> 03:14.000\nMax, what do you do for a living?\n\n03:14.000 --> 03:23.000\nWhat sort of performances do you do Max?\n\n03:23.000 --> 03:26.000\nI'll take it however I want to take it Max.\n\n03:26.000 --> 03:30.000\nAre you willing to come up on stage and feel it out with us?\n\n03:30.000 --> 03:35.000\nWelcome Max to the stage everybody.\n\n03:35.000 --> 03:41.000\nThis show really got off right out of the gate like a rocket.\n\n03:41.000 --> 03:51.000\nAlright, cross your fingers. This guy better be black as hell.\n\n03:51.000 --> 03:57.000\nYeah, black enough.\n\n03:57.000 --> 04:01.000\nAwesome, hello.\n\n04:01.000 --> 04:05.000\nNow you can grab one of those and have a seat.\n\n04:05.000 --> 04:15.000\nYeah, microphone and a seat. Just as promised you your people in the 1940s.\n\n04:15.000 --> 04:21.000\nSo did you come because last week I pled for more black people?\n\n04:21.000 --> 04:25.000\nNo.\n\n04:25.000 --> 04:28.000\nDo you have the blackest voice ever?\n\n04:28.000 --> 04:32.000\nIt's me and James Earl Jones.\n\n04:32.000 --> 04:36.000\nEvery year we just kind of see who can go more bass.\n\n04:36.000 --> 04:41.000\nI'm getting there. When I was 13 it was close but now he's starting to lose it.\n\n04:41.000 --> 04:47.000\nCan you sing a low note? I wish I could. I love like bass singers.\n\n04:47.000 --> 04:50.000\nThis is me.\n\n04:50.000 --> 04:53.000\nGet lower than that.\n\n04:53.000 --> 04:59.000\nOkay, hold on.\n\n04:59.000 --> 05:09.000\nThere's such a fine line between post-racial and pre-menstrual humor.\n\n05:09.000 --> 05:12.000\nHow would you like me to perform? Let's bring him up.\n\n05:12.000 --> 05:15.000\nHow low is your voice?\n\n05:15.000 --> 05:20.000\nIt's a hair's breadth. What are we doing?\n\n05:20.000 --> 05:25.000\nWe're talking about a gentleman with a great basso profundo voice.\n\n05:25.000 --> 05:30.000\nI'm not indicting us. I'm just pointing out what a razor's edge we walk in the modern world\n\n05:30.000 --> 05:36.000\nand how far you go to just find yourself back at fascination with each other.\n\n05:36.000 --> 05:44.000\nI feel bad for Brian. Is Brian right? The first guy, he got supplanted by Maxie.\n\n05:44.000 --> 05:47.000\nThere was just good comedy.\n\n05:47.000 --> 05:50.000\nWhat was the first? It was just a voice from the back.\n\n05:50.000 --> 05:52.000\nYeah, I'm here.\n\n05:52.000 --> 05:54.000\nIt was just good.\n\n05:54.000 --> 06:00.000\nBrian can come up too but I don't want to feel like we're pitting people against each other.\n\n06:00.000 --> 06:02.000\nOnly one black person at a time.\n\n06:02.000 --> 06:09.000\nI can feel you presence though.\n\n06:09.000 --> 06:14.000\nBrian, do you also want to come up or do you not want to be dehumanized like this?\n\n06:14.000 --> 06:20.000\nBrian, get your ass up here, Brian.\n\n06:20.000 --> 06:24.000\nOkay, alright.\n\n06:24.000 --> 06:27.000\nAlright.\n\n06:27.000 --> 06:35.000\nMan, I'm so excited. Just for that random, I wish that there was still television\n\n06:35.000 --> 06:42.000\nso someone could be flipping through channels and see me hanging out.\n\n06:42.000 --> 06:50.000\nAll my white guilt is just being sucked off the range through a super vacuum out into the stratosphere.\n\n06:50.000 --> 06:55.000\nI love it. All the heat from being a 42-year-old fat white oppressor.\n\n06:55.000 --> 06:59.000\nNow I just feel like I'm fucking on honest ground.\n\n06:59.000 --> 07:04.000\nWhat should we talk about? Randy Quaid?\n\n07:04.000 --> 07:06.000\nIs he in the news?\n\n07:06.000 --> 07:09.000\nYeah, I think he's doing something.\n\n07:09.000 --> 07:13.000\nBrian, sorry, I didn't know enough about me.\n\n07:13.000 --> 07:16.000\nWhat do you do for a living?\n\n07:16.000 --> 07:20.000\nI work at a Jamba Juice.\n\n07:20.000 --> 07:22.000\nSounds like you're making it up a little bit.\n\n07:22.000 --> 07:24.000\nIt's terrible.\n\n07:24.000 --> 07:27.000\nAnd they're not watching or anything?\n\n07:27.000 --> 07:33.000\nNo, nobody at that Jamba Juice would ever watch a podcast or listen to it or anything.\n\n07:33.000 --> 07:36.000\nWhat's the worst thing about working at a Jamba Juice?\n\n07:36.000 --> 07:39.000\nThe people.\n\n07:39.000 --> 07:41.000\nThe coworkers or the customers?\n\n07:41.000 --> 07:43.000\nThe customers for sure.\n\n07:43.000 --> 07:46.000\nJuice isn't that important. It's not.\n\n07:46.000 --> 07:50.000\nThere's a lot of things going on in the world. Juice is not the important thing.\n\n07:50.000 --> 07:55.000\nBy the time you've already decided that you don't even need solid food,\n\n07:55.000 --> 07:57.000\nyou should be an easygoing person when you come into this.\n\n07:57.000 --> 08:00.000\nThe worst thing that happened to you is that you're juice is five minutes late.\n\n08:00.000 --> 08:03.000\nYou have a fucking great life. It's fantastic.\n\n08:03.000 --> 08:06.000\nSo you're saying they're a little impatient and bossy?\n\n08:06.000 --> 08:09.000\nYeah, just generally assholes.\n\n08:09.000 --> 08:11.000\nHow old are you? Can I ask your young enough?\n\n08:11.000 --> 08:12.000\nI'm 23.\n\n08:12.000 --> 08:14.000\nYoung enough to be able to ask?\n\n08:14.000 --> 08:16.000\n23.\n\n08:16.000 --> 08:21.000\nAh, pre-9-11.\n\n08:21.000 --> 08:24.000\nYou haven't even been through 9-11 yet.\n\n08:24.000 --> 08:27.000\nIs that how age works?\n\n08:27.000 --> 08:30.000\nOh, we all experience time with this.\n\n08:30.000 --> 08:32.000\nOkay, alright.\n\n08:32.000 --> 08:39.000\nSorry, I thought all of us had to turn 32 for 9-11 to happen.\n\n08:39.000 --> 08:43.000\nMax, you said you're a performer. What do you do?\n\n08:43.000 --> 08:44.000\nI'm an actor.\n\n08:44.000 --> 08:45.000\nYou're an actor?\n\n08:45.000 --> 08:47.000\nAre you working on stuff?\n\n08:47.000 --> 08:51.000\nI just relocated to Los Angeles three days ago, four days ago.\n\n08:51.000 --> 08:52.000\nWelcome.\n\n08:52.000 --> 08:54.000\nFrom where?\n\n08:54.000 --> 08:55.000\nFrom New York.\n\n08:55.000 --> 08:57.000\nFrom New York? Wow.\n\n08:57.000 --> 09:01.000\nMan, this is an authentic black person.\n\n09:01.000 --> 09:10.000\nThis isn't like one of your black friends who doesn't know any other black people.\n\n09:10.000 --> 09:13.000\nI bet you know a ton of black people, don't you?\n\n09:13.000 --> 09:15.000\nI went to school with a bunch of them. Acting.\n\n09:15.000 --> 09:17.000\nBlack acting school.\n\n09:17.000 --> 09:19.000\nNo, okay.\n\n09:19.000 --> 09:21.000\nAlright, I pushed it too far.\n\n09:21.000 --> 09:25.000\nI thought it was like, there was a show when I was a kid called Fame.\n\n09:25.000 --> 09:27.000\nIt was about acting.\n\n09:27.000 --> 09:29.000\nYeah, I remember Fame. It was about LaGuardia.\n\n09:29.000 --> 09:31.000\nLaGuardia in New York City is a school.\n\n09:31.000 --> 09:33.000\nYeah, that's not where you went, right?\n\n09:33.000 --> 09:37.000\nNo, but I know some black actors that went to LaGuardia.\n\n09:37.000 --> 09:40.000\nI think it was Irene Caro?\n\n09:40.000 --> 09:42.000\nWas that the actress's name?\n\n09:42.000 --> 09:43.000\nShe sang the song.\n\n09:43.000 --> 09:44.000\nOh, okay.\n\n09:44.000 --> 09:48.000\nIn the title sequence, there was an actor who was one of the teachers.\n\n09:48.000 --> 09:52.000\nI think first there was a movie with the song.\n\n09:52.000 --> 09:55.000\nI don't know if the movie was an adaptation of the song.\n\n09:55.000 --> 10:00.000\nBut then the TV show, and then the credits for the TV show and the opening title sequence,\n\n10:00.000 --> 10:04.000\nthere was just this woman saying, you want Fame? You want success?\n\n10:04.000 --> 10:08.000\nWell, right here is where you start paying in sweat.\n\n10:08.000 --> 10:11.000\nAnd it was just a show about talented high school kids.\n\n10:11.000 --> 10:14.000\nIn the movie, that's where Coco takes her shirt off and cries.\n\n10:14.000 --> 10:15.000\nOh, yeah, yeah.\n\n10:15.000 --> 10:17.000\nYou want Fame? Fame costs. Right now is where you start paying.\n\n10:17.000 --> 10:19.000\nOh, you know what I'm talking about.\n\n10:19.000 --> 10:22.000\nWhen I was a kid, I was at MGM, which is now Sony Lot.\n\n10:22.000 --> 10:26.000\nI think I was shooting something, like Highway to Heaven or something.\n\n10:26.000 --> 10:30.000\nMe and my mom were walking down between the sound stages,\n\n10:30.000 --> 10:33.000\nand a golf cart goes by, and on the back of the golf cart,\n\n10:33.000 --> 10:36.000\nwe're walking, and on the back of the golf cart going past us,\n\n10:36.000 --> 10:40.000\nI forget the actor's name, but he played Leroy on Fame.\n\n10:40.000 --> 10:42.000\nWho's that fucking great dancer, remember him?\n\n10:42.000 --> 10:44.000\nOh, yeah. Do you have cornrows?\n\n10:44.000 --> 10:47.000\nKind of, yeah, I think. And he waved at me like he knew me.\n\n10:47.000 --> 10:50.000\nHe pointed at me and waved, and my mom's like,\n\n10:50.000 --> 10:52.000\nwhy is Leroy waving at you?\n\n10:52.000 --> 10:54.000\nI go, I think Leroy thinks he knows me.\n\n10:54.000 --> 10:56.000\nI felt so cool.\n\n10:56.000 --> 10:58.000\nMax, you want to drink? You were looking...\n\n10:58.000 --> 11:00.000\nI was eyeing it, but...\n\n11:00.000 --> 11:02.000\nYou got to help yourself, though.\n\n11:02.000 --> 11:04.000\nI don't want to dig in the ice with my hands for you.\n\n11:04.000 --> 11:06.000\nThank you.\n\n11:06.000 --> 11:09.000\nSo, Brian, are you from LA?\n\n11:09.000 --> 11:11.000\nNo, I'm from New Orleans originally,\n\n11:11.000 --> 11:13.000\nbut I live in Oakland.\n\n11:13.000 --> 11:16.000\nI just came down here to help a friend move\n\n11:16.000 --> 11:18.000\nand to see Harmontown.\n\n11:18.000 --> 11:20.000\nReally? Yeah.\n\n11:20.000 --> 11:22.000\nYou helped somebody move, and you came to a different town to do it?\n\n11:22.000 --> 11:24.000\nYes. You're a good person.\n\n11:24.000 --> 11:26.000\nYeah, good friend.\n\n11:26.000 --> 11:28.000\nI really like convenience, also.\n\n11:28.000 --> 11:30.000\nBrian, did you want to drink?\n\n11:30.000 --> 11:32.000\nYeah.\n\n11:32.000 --> 11:34.000\nHarmon's become bartender. I love this.\n\n11:34.000 --> 11:36.000\nWe really do need, like...\n\n11:36.000 --> 11:38.000\nDan Harmon is making me a drink. This is amazing.\n\n11:38.000 --> 11:40.000\nYeah, it's like...\n\n11:40.000 --> 11:44.000\nIt's like really the kid cleaning your gun.\n\n11:47.000 --> 11:49.000\nThat's exactly what I was thinking.\n\n11:49.000 --> 11:52.000\nIt's like Patrick Swayze packing your parachute.\n\n11:52.000 --> 11:54.000\nOr teaching me how to dance.\n\n11:54.000 --> 11:57.000\nIt's like Santa Claus sitting on your lap.\n\n11:57.000 --> 11:59.000\nThere you go.\n\n11:59.000 --> 12:04.000\nI group around the bullseye, and then the professional improviser...\n\n12:04.000 --> 12:07.000\nBy the way, we have Greg Proops here tonight.\n\n12:07.000 --> 12:09.000\nHe'll be coming up on that.\n\n12:09.000 --> 12:11.000\nYeah!\n\n12:11.000 --> 12:15.000\nInarguably a white man, but...\n\n12:15.000 --> 12:17.000\nAlthough, when you get Greg drunk,\n\n12:17.000 --> 12:19.000\nwhen Greg gets just drunk and high enough,\n\n12:19.000 --> 12:21.000\nhe becomes a black jazz musician from 1933.\n\n12:21.000 --> 12:24.000\nHe's a very groovy white man.\n\n12:24.000 --> 12:27.000\nHe becomes incredibly like a jazz musician. It's very good.\n\n12:27.000 --> 12:30.000\nAll right, so we've got Max, the aspiring performer.\n\n12:30.000 --> 12:32.000\nSo you're very young, too. What are you, 20...\n\n12:32.000 --> 12:34.000\nCan I ask?\n\n12:34.000 --> 12:36.000\nYeah, 27.\n\n12:36.000 --> 12:39.000\nSo, out here from New York...\n\n12:39.000 --> 12:43.000\nIt sounds like he's doing a bit sometimes.\n\n12:43.000 --> 12:45.000\nJust came here from New York,\n\n12:45.000 --> 12:49.000\nso now what is the plight of a young actor in LA in 2015?\n\n12:49.000 --> 12:51.000\nHow does it work? Does it still look the same?\n\n12:51.000 --> 12:53.000\nYou still got a pile of headshots in your back seat,\n\n12:53.000 --> 12:55.000\nand you just kind of...\n\n12:55.000 --> 12:57.000\nIt's all digital now. I don't know about...\n\n12:57.000 --> 12:59.000\nYeah, LinkedIn.\n\n13:02.000 --> 13:04.000\nYeah, now it's just...\n\n13:04.000 --> 13:06.000\nSo, is there... Do you have an agent?\n\n13:06.000 --> 13:08.000\nI have a manager.\n\n13:08.000 --> 13:11.000\nIs there...

I don't think it's it's a jet fuel jet fuel\n\n34:38.940 --> 34:40.940\nJet fuel of course. That's what Jets\n\n34:41.540 --> 34:43.540\nused to go from one place to another\n\n34:44.260 --> 34:46.260\nlike rocket fuel for\n\n34:47.380 --> 34:49.140\nRockets and whatnot\n\n34:49.140 --> 34:51.140\nSpeaking of rocket fuel\n\n34:53.260 --> 34:55.260\nSo all right\n\n34:55.900 --> 34:59.340\nI'm well.

It's like I'm in airports all the time\n\n37:39.580 --> 37:42.500\nAnd there's always guys on the commode as it were\n\n37:43.540 --> 37:49.860\nHaving long conversations with their loved ones while they're doing the thing and to me that's I gross gross\n\n37:50.380 --> 37:53.540\nThere's a time and a place for everything and a conversation doesn't take place while you're\n\n37:53.540 --> 37:59.740\nEliminating I've never wanted to take a picture of my wand and I've never wanted to take a picture of any excrement\n\n38:00.140 --> 38:07.340\nBut that's me. I'm a sissy. I mean you're you're a bold Viking who fucking forges forward and breaks through post-racial\n\n38:07.820 --> 38:09.820\nbarriers and\n\n38:09.980 --> 38:15.380\nPeople from Jamba Juice on stage and gives them money so I can understand why you're you're a\n\n38:15.500 --> 38:20.180\nLimitory system might be a matter of some pride. Yeah, I didn't I didn't feel brave\n\n38:20.180 --> 38:26.940\nI felt cowardly as I was taking a picture like I felt like the the the the chimpanzees in the beginning of 2001\n\n38:28.500 --> 38:34.460\nI'm scared of this giant thing black thing that came out of yeah, if those things had cameras\n\n38:34.460 --> 38:41.180\nThey would have those ostrich lipid the scene. They would have snapped a pic of the monolith. All right. Anyways took a huge shit\n\n38:41.180 --> 38:42.180\nI mean it was a hockey stick\n\n38:42.180 --> 38:48.340\nOkay, but was it in the shape if it had been in the shape of a monolith then I might consider it if it had come out as\n\n38:48.340 --> 38:53.860\nA perfect rectangle. I might think that's this is just you know what this isn't history anymore. This is science\n\n38:55.060 --> 39:03.020\nYeah, we're gonna kneel to grass Tyson territory here and that the odds of taking a rectangular shit or one and one billion and yet\n\n39:03.020 --> 39:07.900\nDan Harmon achieved it four times last week after visiting the fat burger on Centum on\n\n39:10.100 --> 39:14.540\nYeah, I don't even know what I did and I didn't experience anything untoward on the toilet\n\n39:14.540 --> 39:18.500\nI was it was like it was like a normal experience sailing. I was just sitting there thinking about\n\n39:19.580 --> 39:21.580\nXanadu or whatever and I\n\n39:21.580 --> 39:24.380\nAnd I just I just got off and I looked down and it was like this\n\n39:25.500 --> 39:29.420\nRemarkable amazing. Okay, we don't have to we don't have to talk about it. It's a conversation that goes nowhere\n\n39:29.420 --> 39:32.340\nI only wanted to talk about the relationship\n\n39:32.340 --> 39:38.180\nDid you ever see the South Park episode with the guy where the dad takes the giant shit that they do a whole episode?\n\n39:38.180 --> 39:41.620\nI mean that's like it is there is something about I\n\n39:41.620 --> 39:46.060\nI it's it's it's a it's an exploration of a thing that's always going on that of course\n\n39:46.060 --> 39:51.140\nNo one wants you don't want to talk to other people about your shit. Some people still tell each other about their dreams\n\n39:51.140 --> 39:53.140\nI'm you know who you are\n\n39:54.420 --> 40:00.540\nLike like even that's not so great. So of course talking about your shit like in the minutia like it's like oh gross\n\n40:00.540 --> 40:03.380\nI don't like that when people go like oh, it was like a pebble\n\n40:03.380 --> 40:06.820\nBut it had a stick on the end and I'm like, I don't care. I don't want picture your shit\n\n40:06.820 --> 40:12.580\nBut but at the same time, I think there's something interesting about the fact that you know we we we we\n\n40:13.180 --> 40:16.820\nYou know we do we do we do so few things every day\n\n40:16.820 --> 40:22.020\nAnd there's so few of those things that we do every day that we that we never really really talk about\n\n40:22.020 --> 40:26.380\nAnd then we really have a relationship with and it was it was it was the biggest shit of my life\n\n40:26.380 --> 40:32.580\nIt was a foot. I've only been married once and I've only taken this big a shit once. I haven't had a baby yet\n\n40:33.140 --> 40:36.260\nBut I mean it seemed like I did when I alright\n\n40:36.260 --> 40:41.260\nSo alright, that's it. That's it. It was a special shit and I didn't call 9-1-1 or anything\n\n40:41.260 --> 40:45.860\nNo, I took a picture and I just I just went upstairs. Hey, Greg. Thanks for coming. Greg Proops everybody\n\n40:49.260 --> 40:51.740\nTo the H into the a into the alright\n\n40:52.860 --> 40:58.500\nAll right. Well, okay, so that's the that's the gross segment of the show. I had another thing about I always\n\n40:59.820 --> 41:04.900\nWondered about you know when you the recycle bin if you blow your nose and then\n\n41:04.900 --> 41:09.780\nYou right is it still recycling is it garbage now? Well, yeah, are you supposed to put it in there?\n\n41:09.780 --> 41:13.540\nAnd I always picture like like a shoebox made out of recycled materials\n\n41:13.540 --> 41:19.460\nIt was like are my my boogers somehow a part of the box right is like the last part of the coleslaw in the cardboard thing\n\n41:19.460 --> 41:24.340\nStill recycling or is it garbage because it's got the organic man. Yeah, you recycle tissues\n\n41:24.820 --> 41:28.540\nWell, you're supposed to he takes pictures of his shit Jeff. There's really\n\n41:29.540 --> 41:33.180\nThere's really unlimited possibilities as to what he recycles at this point\n\n41:33.180 --> 41:39.700\nYou're supposed to throw out your discarded paper products like like like but like well blow your nose and throw that in the recycle bin\n\n41:39.700 --> 41:44.700\nWell, I mean, it's not like being I mean that well, this is a question. I mean, I don't know\n\n41:44.700 --> 41:49.060\nI always hover over the two things because I'm like, well answer it. I'll go garbage\n\n41:49.060 --> 41:53.620\nI'm not because people have to pick through the recycling and they certainly don't want to feel your\n\n41:54.660 --> 41:58.180\nexcretions there's a human being there's like a jawa that goes through every\n\n41:58.180 --> 42:01.780\nThey don't just put it like a puddle\n\n42:02.660 --> 42:04.820\nto black people up here your\n\n42:05.500 --> 42:07.500\nunderstanding of what the underclass has to do is\n\n42:08.180 --> 42:13.340\nRather limited. I would think in this regard Dan. Yes, people have to go through every manner of\n\n42:14.620 --> 42:17.420\nThink I think the recycling bin gets dumped out\n\n42:17.420 --> 42:23.380\nWell, take me through from the blue bin goes into the truck and then they take that one to Austrian men\n\n42:23.380 --> 42:28.620\nOne's named Franz the other. I don't know his name. Take it to an area outside of Pomona, California\n\n42:28.620 --> 42:32.780\nwhere it's dumped into a giant refuse pile much like the volcano in Mordor and\n\n42:33.660 --> 42:41.620\non the on the sides of this it's much like that that movie from several years ago the one with all the Indian children that won the Oscar for\n\n42:42.700 --> 42:47.740\nSlumdog millionaire, right? Yeah, slumdog millionaire where it made people feel awful and therefore good\n\n42:47.740 --> 42:56.780\nBecause it was in color and there was dancing and why not so all the excreta effluvium erotic and\n\n42:57.260 --> 42:59.260\nJetsum that the world\n\n42:59.300 --> 43:03.300\nPerpetrates someone has to go through each piece of it to see if there's any value to it\n\n43:03.300 --> 43:09.500\nAnd then they either put it in a bag and take it to a community where they sell it or it goes into a big giant furnace\n\n43:09.500 --> 43:11.500\nthat's marked big devil and\n\n43:11.700 --> 43:15.740\nThat's that's how recycling works, but you're talking about I mean we have a de facto\n\n43:15.740 --> 43:23.360\nFacto layer in there where the I have of course bullshitting at all times, but I would appreciate it if you'd maintain your respectful silence\n\n43:24.380 --> 43:29.220\nBecause there's there are homeless people that go through and they go through the bins and then they go like oh\n\n43:29.220 --> 43:32.620\nThey're there for the term indigenous street people, but yes\n\n43:33.620 --> 43:36.940\nAnd they grab the stuff homeless infers that everyone gets a home\n\n43:36.940 --> 43:39.700\nWhich is I think our friend who works at Jamba Juice will attest\n\n43:39.700 --> 43:46.140\nWhen you're a wage slave no home is given to you the idea of home and homeless is a is a fairly\n\n43:46.140 --> 43:49.220\nI think George Carlin worked that point over pretty pedantically\n\n43:50.660 --> 43:57.620\nDon't you think I like I still honestly like all the shit that goes in the paper bin like I don't picture one human being going like\n\n43:57.780 --> 44:01.740\nThis paper's got chocolate on it. It's a crew of people\n\n44:02.380 --> 44:07.620\nI don't know the the ruling on this, but you can't blow your nose and recycle that. That's just seems to thank you\n\n44:07.620 --> 44:10.700\nThat's no, that's that's a no at the very least. It's impolite. Well\n\n44:11.460 --> 44:16.500\nWell, does that but that implied but then you have put your pizza your cardboard pizza box in there, right?\n\n44:16.500 --> 44:20.300\nIt's got cheese on it. Yeah, but think about it. You don't you know you you don't\n\n44:22.100 --> 44:26.740\nYou you put things that are recyclable and then like the things that that's like that recycle this plastic\n\n44:26.740 --> 44:32.380\nRecycler thing things a little symbol on it like things and ideally you clean them first you rinse them off and you put those in the recycle bin\n\n44:32.380 --> 44:36.020\nYou don't just put anything that conceivably could be recycled in the recycle bin\n\n44:36.020 --> 44:38.020\nWell, you know\n\n44:38.180 --> 44:41.580\nI'm sure I'm not the person to be letting you in on this\n\n44:41.580 --> 44:48.260\nBut we have gone recycle crazy to the point where there is often no actual refuse container in like offices and stuff\n\n44:48.260 --> 44:53.260\nThere's like in my in the writer's bungalow at work. There is no non recycling\n\n44:53.260 --> 44:59.020\nThere's like four giant cardboard boxes that all have the recycling someone like compost or something like that\n\n44:59.020 --> 45:03.140\nBecause there's just four big giant fucking boxes that all have that symbol on it\n\n45:03.140 --> 45:08.980\nIs the I don't want to be a libertarian here, but it's the dirty little secret that the shit just goes into a fucking pile with everything else\n\n45:08.980 --> 45:12.700\nIs that like because the stuff that we're putting in these boxes?\n\n45:12.700 --> 45:13.740\nIt's like, oh, yeah\n\n45:13.740 --> 45:16.780\nThis is where the plastic and the paper and the cardboard\n\n45:16.780 --> 45:18.780\nIt's to make people feel better about themselves, right?\n\n45:19.300 --> 45:24.340\nIt's an exercise. It's a charade like a lot of stuff we do and my security at the airport and shit like that\n\n45:24.340 --> 45:30.020\nMost of our waste is like, oh, let's do this and then we'll pretend that it's really happening and why people are happy and everyone goes home\n\n45:30.020 --> 45:33.860\nAnd but you're saying there's still some guy picking through it. That's not just a guy\n\n45:34.580 --> 45:38.820\nLately ever drive down the streets of LA and see people digging in the garbage cans and pulling out Burger King\n\n45:38.820 --> 45:41.460\nRoberts and shit like that. I guarantee you no matter what's happening\n\n45:41.460 --> 45:46.180\nI don't want to bring it down to a bummer level war all all your nice lower-middle-class fans are bummed out\n\n45:46.180 --> 45:49.980\nWe're talking about we're talking about two different things though. You're talking about people like fuck\n\n45:49.980 --> 45:53.460\nI don't even have health care. I'm two paychecks away from going through a burger king fucking rapper\n\n45:53.460 --> 45:58.540\nYou're talking about that's how they talk to themselves. That's it. Everyone's internal monologue in this room. It's kind of like this\n\n45:58.540 --> 46:02.820\nYou're talking about I'm from Daytona. I don't know why everything's like this\n\n46:02.820 --> 46:09.460\nI understand that there's people that go through the garbage cans that then take stuff to the recycling center that the stuff that they\n\n46:09.460 --> 46:14.340\nI understand there's people that go through my garbage shutter that are like scavengers from sector seven\n\n46:14.340 --> 46:17.900\nI get that I admire those people. That's amazing that they're like\n\n46:18.300 --> 46:25.180\nBothering to find the honest labor that quote-unquote honest labor that's afforded to their situation like it blows my mind\n\n46:25.300 --> 46:27.740\nSpencer only gives those people money. He doesn't give paying him. There's money\n\n46:27.740 --> 46:32.340\nHe pulls over and randomly runs up to those people and gives them money because they're like he's\n\n46:32.660 --> 46:36.020\nHas some it's like yeah, you want to encourage the ones that are doing it\n\n46:37.500 --> 46:38.700\nWow\n\n46:38.700 --> 46:41.780\nHe labors under the false notion that this world is a meritocracy\n\n46:43.060 --> 46:49.700\nThat can be enforced even at the lowest level, but I'm talking about at the place like I don't know where this stuff goes\n\n46:49.700 --> 46:52.460\nI know where there are people like I've watched like you know\n\n46:52.460 --> 46:57.940\nThere's a modern marvels and things like that. What is it? There's a guy or a gal at a conveyor belt and they're looking for get this we need\n\n46:57.940 --> 47:01.180\nThat that goes along the thing like they're actually there are right\n\n47:01.700 --> 47:06.580\nSorters at the end. So they're just pulling. There's also a giant plastic island in the South Pacific that bobs up and down\n\n47:06.580 --> 47:12.300\nYeah, yeah, a couple of kilometers wide and yeah, we should be able to start building on that pretty soon, right Dan\n\n47:12.580 --> 47:18.620\nI've talked about it on another show. I want to talk about it on this show. We need to do Harmontown from the garbage island\n\n47:18.620 --> 47:22.100\nIt's out in the South Pacific. I don't know how we get there\n\n47:22.100 --> 47:24.700\nI think you fly and there's no birds or fish anymore\n\n47:24.700 --> 47:27.260\nBut at a certain point in the South Pacific when you get out there\n\n47:27.260 --> 47:31.500\nThere's a giant bunch of birds and fish because the garbage is there and you're like it's an ecosystem is right\n\n47:31.500 --> 47:35.940\nYeah, there's all kinds of you probably can't walk on it though, right? It's not no sure you could it's nothing but six pack\n\n47:36.740 --> 47:40.940\nplastic things and containers and and styrofoam and whatnot and you're you know old tissues and\n\n47:42.260 --> 47:47.940\nJamba juice cups that people threw away in LA that got caught in a tsunami tide and shot across the Pacific and stuff\n\n47:47.940 --> 47:52.500\nAnd I think it's gonna be solid enough in another six months or so that we can do a fucking benefit for it\n\n47:52.660 --> 47:59.180\nWhat what if that ends up being like of the the new world what if what if that is why he was three million years ago?\n\n47:59.180 --> 48:04.940\nWhatever Iceland now garbage island is the new paradigm and then we all it's like where all the intelligentsia live\n\n48:04.940 --> 48:07.060\nOh, yeah, they form a perfect government, right?\n\n48:07.060 --> 48:09.060\nI'm gonna move there like\n\n48:09.100 --> 48:13.180\nArthur Clark moved to Salon and I'm gonna write my next novel there and by that time\n\n48:13.180 --> 48:18.180\nThere'll be mammals and monkeys and whatnot living on the garbage island as well and fauna and flora\n\n48:18.580 --> 48:21.940\nAnd there'll be palm trees growing out of nowhere and whatnot nature finds a way\n\n48:24.020 --> 48:29.660\nIf we've learned nothing we've learned that Jeff Goldblum's absolutely right in the movie Jurassic Park\n\n48:31.100 --> 48:34.980\nNature does find there's so many movies he's right in and independence day is one\n\n48:34.980 --> 48:40.460\nBut the other one is Jurassic Park if you can get an Apple Mac to interface with an alien craft like he does in\n\n48:40.460 --> 48:47.380\nIndependence day that is some feat of technology. Was he right in powder Greg and powder and powder was\n\n48:48.380 --> 48:50.380\nJeff when is Jeff Goldblum wrong?\n\n48:51.300 --> 48:55.500\nHe's right. He's right. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. I\n\n48:56.820 --> 48:59.980\nHear I hear a grown man, but inside a frightened girl\n\n49:00.900 --> 49:05.220\nWait, yeah, but they're right. He was wrong in the fly. He fucking he was\n\n49:05.220 --> 49:11.060\nBut you know what he was right about he married Gina Davis while he made that movie. So he was right about that\n\n49:11.060 --> 49:14.940\nWell, okay, but the thing about the fly is it's a tragedy. It's like Macbeth\n\n49:14.940 --> 49:21.500\nSo Macbeth was right about killing the king making him king. Well, he made a deal with the devil didn't he though?\n\n49:21.500 --> 49:23.540\nI mean, and that's there's the rubber, right\n\n49:23.540 --> 49:29.460\nBut I'm saying that like yours that Goldblum is always at his best when he's right about something in a tragic movie like that\n\n49:29.460 --> 49:33.460\nA sci-fi horror movie that ends with him getting his sorry kids getting his brains blown out\n\n49:33.460 --> 49:35.460\nthat the\n\n49:35.980 --> 49:41.340\nHe's he's he's right the whole time. He's even he's even right even goes now. It's time to blow my brain right\n\n49:41.340 --> 49:46.140\nBut he's he has a conscience in that one and all that jazz. He often does though. He's\n\n49:46.420 --> 49:48.420\nHe's like a gold bloom\n\n49:50.380 --> 49:53.880\nYou know what I mean, all right, so I\n\n49:56.100 --> 49:58.780\nThink that he's married now. So all the women in the room are safe\n\n49:58.780 --> 50:04.780\nFor the moment if he was roaming around L.A. Yeah, he's he almost hurtled me like like oh, yeah\n\n50:04.780 --> 50:10.060\nHe's my high or taller. Oh, no, he's quite tall. Yeah, and I was at a thing and I'm on a date with some girl\n\n50:10.060 --> 50:14.340\nLike it wasn't like a hot day. It was a girl. I knew we went to go see him play at the Argyle hotel\n\n50:14.340 --> 50:16.820\nWhich is now called the the sunset whatever the fuck\n\n50:16.820 --> 50:22.300\nBut we went and saw him and I was in the in the men's room and there was a men's room attendant\n\n50:22.300 --> 50:27.420\nAnd I saw I was washing my hands and there's Jeff Goldblum and the men's room attendant his sign says thank you\n\n50:27.420 --> 50:32.620\nMy name is Jeff so I'm washing my hands next to Jeff Goldblum and there's a guy named Jeff and I said well\n\n50:32.620 --> 50:35.340\nMy name is Jeff too. I said, you know meteor hits his bathroom\n\n50:35.340 --> 50:39.020\nThat's that takes care a lot of the Jeff's building and and Goldblum looks at me goes\n\n50:41.600 --> 50:43.600\nYeah, yeah\n\n50:48.740 --> 50:50.980\nSo we walk outside and I'm with some gal and\n\n50:50.980 --> 50:57.740\nI choose good-looking kind of and and and he I introduced him to her because now we now we have we've had that moments\n\n50:57.740 --> 51:05.260\nAnd I introduce it. This is another Jeff and and he talks to this gal and never ever ever takes her eyes off of her\n\n51:05.260 --> 51:05.740\ntips\n\n51:05.740 --> 51:12.380\nYeah, and and and then later like he he if he could have walked through me like with the at the atoms could have aligned\n\n51:12.380 --> 51:15.500\nWe could have actually passed through me because that would have been faster\n\n51:15.500 --> 51:20.660\nLike quantum leap or something. Yes, we could have just completely\n\n51:25.180 --> 51:30.780\nIt's now five minutes from now and I just walked through you you can get creepy to the point where you transcend\n\n51:34.460 --> 51:35.980\nIf we took a\n\n51:35.980 --> 51:37.980\nInformal pole of every woman in this room\n\n51:38.060 --> 51:41.180\nHe he's hit on every woman. I think on earth\n\n51:41.180 --> 51:46.660\nYeah, for sure. There is there's a hundred and fifty people in this room. Maybe or am I flattering myself?\n\n51:47.660 --> 51:49.660\nLet's assume that\n\n51:50.300 --> 51:53.740\nThat half of them are not women because it's Harmontown. It's like more like\n\n51:54.540 --> 51:56.020\nI\n\n51:56.020 --> 51:59.260\nYou're right this time just beating your your observation dead the\n\n52:00.140 --> 52:06.820\nNumber of women that I have talked to that have a Jeff Goldblum story that specifically about his sort of I don't want to use\n\n52:06.820 --> 52:08.820\nHot-button language like predatory or anything\n\n52:08.820 --> 52:11.780\nHe's not predatory that it's I've done a couple gigs with him\n\n52:11.780 --> 52:18.100\nI used to have him on my chat show a couple times and he was absolutely charming and and really lovable and fucking just like was\n\n52:18.540 --> 52:21.060\nCeaseless. Yeah, but you know, you know that old saying\n\n52:21.580 --> 52:27.460\nWhen you're a teenager guy say to you if you hit on every girl like eventually one you can't you can't hit if you don't swing\n\n52:27.460 --> 52:33.060\nRight. He's the only person next to Bill Clinton who's actually observed that philosophy\n\n52:33.540 --> 52:37.580\nYou know what I mean like most guys don't most guys don't hit on every single girl\n\n52:37.580 --> 52:41.540\nThey need but Jeff Goldblum and Bill Clinton. I think you're like, hey, how's it going?\n\n52:41.860 --> 52:46.620\nAnd then every woman goes no and pushes them away and they're like fine. I'm on to the next but he also has a thing\n\n52:46.620 --> 52:52.300\nHe has that really like animal like like sexual drive where when he sees a woman\n\n52:52.300 --> 53:12.060\nIt's like laser beam lock like target lock. Oh, yeah, like the predator. Oh, see you. Yeah, you are one ugly bastard\n\n53:14.540 --> 53:19.700\nBlender of predator references there. It's a he the predator was hunting the person\n\n53:19.700 --> 53:21.700\nBut then he was Arnold Schwarzenegger\n\n53:21.700 --> 53:23.700\nI changed\n\n53:24.700 --> 53:26.700\nMy scenes have a lot of\n\n53:28.580 --> 53:30.900\nIt's not complex as much as it is perplexed\n\n53:30.900 --> 53:35.500\nI also I got I got nearly I think you could call it a cross check a hip check\n\n53:35.660 --> 53:40.420\nI'm not sure what the correct hockey term is Bruce Willis went through me like he actually\n\n53:40.740 --> 53:43.700\nDozed me over to get to it to get to a girl like wow\n\n53:44.060 --> 53:46.060\nAnd then I saw me he saw a girl\n\n53:46.500 --> 53:50.540\nAnd this is like my first girlfriend like that I was ever in love with and I was like early 20s\n\n53:50.540 --> 53:56.220\nAnd she looked enough like Demi Moore for me to get it like like like he she certainly was in his zone\n\n53:56.220 --> 54:01.940\nAnd he came out of the men's room at this club in Hollywood and saw her from across the way and there was various\n\n54:02.580 --> 54:07.820\nsofas and human beings and like like like Mario obstacles, you know\n\n54:07.820 --> 54:12.340\nThings for him to like like like pipes\n\n54:15.740 --> 54:19.060\nThere was various Donkey Kong barrels rolling at him, but he had to get through\n\n54:20.340 --> 54:26.900\nAnd he saw her from across the room at about let's call it like you know, let's say 30 feet 40 feet and\n\n54:27.420 --> 54:30.300\nLooked and saw like Robocop saw the lay of the land\n\n54:31.100 --> 54:33.100\nlike sofa\n\n54:33.100 --> 54:37.840\n1.5 meters high like like like charting a course she was four meters high\n\n54:39.820 --> 54:46.140\nThe sofa was like the sofa's 1.4 meters and so he he looked around if it'll take so long to walk around\n\n54:46.340 --> 54:50.740\nLike like a human like a person would through the through affairs of traffic\n\n54:50.740 --> 54:53.260\nThat a person might walk to get from one point to another in a bar\n\n54:53.340 --> 54:57.300\nHe just started jumping over and climbing over accepting on people's coats\n\n54:57.300 --> 55:03.380\nWow, just just just he was that desperate to get to her beeline and then he went kaboom right into me and I didn't like\n\n55:03.380 --> 55:05.820\nI kind of saw him coming. I I saw him coming\n\n55:05.820 --> 55:08.860\nI saw this all happening and I turned to my girlfriend and\n\n55:09.340 --> 55:11.860\nThe next thing I know I see him and he's right on me and just goes\n\n55:11.860 --> 55:18.340\nIt just knocks me like not all the way to the ground, but nearly Wow.

He's probably like hey come over here\n\n55:41.780 --> 55:50.020\nBut Hudson Hawk guy is like vaulting like like bringing our two seagrams. All right, they don't even know they don't even remember\n\n55:50.020 --> 55:54.360\nI've had a few guys do it. It's pretty desperate.

Oh, sorry\n\n56:22.460 --> 56:24.460\nSo many floors in this building\n\n56:33.460 --> 56:37.500\nI don't begrudge him for that but we all wanted what he was having that night because he likes\n\n56:37.500 --> 56:45.220\nOh, that's so I love that. I've never yeah, I'd love to be near and my friend Tom Kenny told me that he was at Johnny Ramon's funeral and\n\n56:46.180 --> 56:47.220\nover at\n\n56:47.220 --> 56:48.900\nHollywood Forever and\n\n56:48.900 --> 56:54.980\nNicholas Cage was very good friends with Johnny Ramon and he goes he wore a matrix outfit a long black coat and shades\n\n56:54.980 --> 56:57.900\nAnd he goes everybody got up and spoke and then Nicholas Cage went\n\n56:57.900 --> 57:06.580\nJohnny, if you're up there, I know you can hear us\n\n57:06.580 --> 57:07.580\nAwesome\n\n57:07.580 --> 57:13.060\nI want Nicholas Cage in my funeral. Yes, you do. I don't even care if I can't see it. I want him to be there and go Greg\n\n57:16.060 --> 57:18.340\nYes, rockin good news\n\n57:18.340 --> 57:31.220\nI don't even know him I want Nick Cage to do the eulogy so he can go Greg, you know\n\n57:32.580 --> 57:37.100\nHe could probably charge for that the same way that they sell like the cryogenic\n\n57:37.780 --> 57:41.060\nFreezing companies like those are all scams. It's like, oh, who's gonna sue you?\n\n57:41.060 --> 57:45.900\nYou know your head in a bucket, but so Nick Cage could make you he could yeah\n\n57:45.900 --> 57:48.340\nA million dollars old.

Yeah, so Gary Busey\n\n58:20.620 --> 58:22.620\nNicholas Cage\n\n58:23.180 --> 58:25.180\nI think\n\n58:25.620 --> 58:29.700\nLike I kind of do it by like thinking because it's like like like like this is done. Not\n\n58:30.300 --> 58:33.460\nI'm done. Not but then this is Bill Clinton\n\n58:34.260 --> 58:36.260\nBill Clinton\n\n58:36.260 --> 58:42.260\nI'm a little weapon\n\n58:43.100 --> 58:48.740\nI'm done nuts. I'm Bill Clinton. I'm done nuts\n\n58:49.540 --> 58:51.540\nI'm Bill Clinton. Yeah\n\n58:52.100 --> 58:55.300\nAnd then there's a third one that fits that same category. Who's it?\n\n58:56.020 --> 58:59.260\nWho's it? Who's it? Who's the third? Is it Jimmy Stewart?\n\n58:59.700 --> 59:01.700\nWell, Jimmy Stewart's more though. Oh\n\n59:01.700 --> 59:06.380\nOh, Jimmy Stewart. I'm done nuts. I'm Bill Clinton\n\n59:07.620 --> 59:12.540\nBut when he raised but Jimmy Stewart raises his voice he does the weird octave thing like in I was watching him\n\n59:12.620 --> 59:17.140\nWhat's the Christmas picture where it's a wonderful life? Yes, and\n\n59:18.540 --> 59:21.260\nNot as good as I remembered it frankly a little more\n\n59:21.620 --> 59:23.620\nNot a torped\n\n59:23.660 --> 59:28.980\nSweaty it's a sweaty fucking Christmas movie everybody would rather live in Bedford Falls because it's way more fun\n\n59:28.980 --> 59:35.820\nBedford Falls has bars that are open all night and and and like places to dance and people talk jive and stuff\n\n59:35.820 --> 59:39.220\nYeah, right in the regular Bedford Falls everyone.

It's it's chairs. Yeah, it's silver ponytails. Yeah, exactly\n\n01:01:25.340 --> 01:01:27.340\nlots of silver ponytails and\n\n01:01:27.700 --> 01:01:32.940\nYeah, and so I look for the thing and of course it's because it's drew it is the dead center seat\n\n01:01:32.940 --> 01:01:36.940\nYeah, there are 15 seats right Muhammad Ali's in the corner.

I think oh wow this guy bought 12 seats for himself\n\n01:01:49.140 --> 01:01:54.540\nSo I'm sitting there and finally drew comes and our friends all show up and I think you're at you're a homicide detective\n\n01:01:55.220 --> 01:02:02.220\nWho never solved the case of the guy who kept murdering women and playing a John Fogarty song over the phone every time he did it\n\n01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:06.660\nSo he plays born on the bayou. I'm gonna scan this crowd pretty fucking hard tonight\n\n01:02:07.300 --> 01:02:09.300\nSo it's a song that they did\n\n01:02:09.300 --> 01:02:14.220\nSo fucking John Fogarty sounds amazing. He can't he still sounds like it's you know, yeah\n\n01:02:14.220 --> 01:02:19.380\n40 years ago. He's brilliant and he's laying it down and then drew comes in it all of our friends are there and\n\n01:02:19.620 --> 01:02:21.700\nI'm like, thank you for coming. It was very strange\n\n01:02:21.700 --> 01:02:26.580\nBut I kind of like it was kind of fun to be like the weirdest like high roller guy that didn't buy the tickets\n\n01:02:26.580 --> 01:02:28.100\nYou know drew carried it\n\n01:02:28.100 --> 01:02:33.300\nThen I keep getting flicked in the back of the head and it's bucey. He's he's he's row three and\n\n01:02:33.940 --> 01:02:37.780\nEveryone is seated because like it's people watching a show and it's not like, you know\n\n01:02:37.780 --> 01:02:42.820\nThe nine-inch nails is not on stage. It's it's it's you know, he's like like put me in coach\n\n01:02:42.820 --> 01:02:45.500\nYou know, I think no one's gonna be standing up today. So, uh\n\n01:02:46.100 --> 01:02:49.260\nWe drew he keeps flicking me and drew in the back. Hey guys\n\n01:02:50.620 --> 01:02:56.100\nHey, it's like it's a painful flicks on the back of the head like you're in junior high school and\n\n01:02:56.740 --> 01:02:58.240\nwe're like\n\n01:02:58.240 --> 01:03:02.420\nGary music he's flicking me in the head and and he's standing up. Yeah\n\n01:03:02.420 --> 01:03:08.140\nYeah, the whole show and at one point Fogarty looks up and goes Gary. I see you sit down\n\n01:03:12.820 --> 01:03:14.820\nWow\n\n01:03:17.180 --> 01:03:19.820\nSo I can't imagine how many shows he's been to\n\n01:03:21.660 --> 01:03:24.460\nCome on man, like like this people are trying to enjoy this shit\n\n01:03:24.460 --> 01:03:32.460\nSo imagine having success at that level where Gary Busey is your Adam Goldberg. Oh\n\n01:03:37.780 --> 01:03:43.740\nYou have you have the regular crazy guy that comes to the show that sometimes you gotta go. Hey take it easy and it's Gary Busey\n\n01:03:45.220 --> 01:03:48.100\nThat's fantastic, you know Gary Busey was in\n\n01:03:48.900 --> 01:03:52.620\nLeon Russell's band. He was the drummer for years and his name was Teddy Jack Eddy\n\n01:03:52.620 --> 01:03:55.180\nHe went by Teddy Jack Eddy and when he did Buddy Holly\n\n01:03:55.180 --> 01:04:01.740\nHe played and sang all the fucking songs in the movie with that with that band Gary Busey is a like a you know, not only is he\n\n01:04:02.500 --> 01:04:04.500\nYou know amazingly\n\n01:04:05.100 --> 01:04:06.860\nincandescently weird\n\n01:04:06.860 --> 01:04:11.980\nTo put it gently. He actually has a rock-and-roll background which makes it even more frightening. Yeah\n\n01:04:11.980 --> 01:04:16.300\nWell, okay, that's a perfect segue to let's bring out Spencer first of all\n\n01:04:18.540 --> 01:04:20.540\nSpencer Crittenden\n\n01:04:20.540 --> 01:04:24.660\nTo the Spence to the sir to the Spence Spencer\n\n01:04:26.660 --> 01:04:28.660\nHey, baby\n\n01:04:32.220 --> 01:04:36.260\nWe're the kings of rock will take you higher does not really remind you\n\n01:04:36.780 --> 01:04:44.700\nSucker MCs must call me sire.

I\n\n01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:58.300\nI was at my friend's house the other day and I was like has anyone seen that Randy Quaid video and they didn't understand\n\n01:04:58.900 --> 01:05:04.140\nLike and so I was like no you have to see this and then no one put it on immediately\n\n01:05:04.140 --> 01:05:08.860\nSo I was like no you have to see this and every 15 minutes\n\n01:05:08.860 --> 01:05:12.140\nI was like seriously you fucking guys you have to watch this video\n\n01:05:12.140 --> 01:05:15.180\nIt's the most important thing in the world right now\n\n01:05:15.180 --> 01:05:17.820\nI'm aware of it because I saw it on the web today, but I didn't watch it\n\n01:05:17.820 --> 01:05:21.100\nYeah, I did however watch a Dennis Quaid video where he was quite calm\n\n01:05:22.980 --> 01:05:28.180\nThat's what I keep thinking about is Dennis Quaid just this waking up in the morning like like like the morning\n\n01:05:28.180 --> 01:05:32.620\nI get up because there's a call time. It's like 6 30 a.m. Schrab text me Randy Quaid\n\n01:05:33.260 --> 01:05:38.100\nHe sent me a link to the YouTube video and and said he does he quotes\n\n01:05:38.100 --> 01:05:42.900\nIndependence Day at the end of the video watch the whole thing because he goes I'm back\n\n01:05:43.180 --> 01:05:49.860\nWell, he's a thing which is a thing for I wanted to what the thing I was it sent me down this rabbit hole\n\n01:05:49.860 --> 01:05:55.940\nI'm like what what happened with Randy Quaid because he everyone just keeps brushing it into this pile and very very\n\n01:05:56.340 --> 01:05:58.340\nphobic about dismissing\n\n01:05:59.100 --> 01:06:01.100\nCrazy behavior. I don't I\n\n01:06:01.580 --> 01:06:06.140\nGuess it's I for obvious reasons like I don't want to be done like you know a couple\n\n01:06:06.140 --> 01:06:12.620\nMoves from that on that chessboard from if we're gonna start depending on where we draw the line\n\n01:06:12.620 --> 01:06:14.620\nI don't know how you play chess. Um, they\n\n01:06:15.100 --> 01:06:17.100\nRook to Harmon for\n\n01:06:17.500 --> 01:06:25.300\nBut into so like I always whenever whenever whenever somebody like has a meltdown in the press or like oh that crazy person that crazy person\n\n01:06:25.300 --> 01:06:32.160\nWhether it's the Coney 2012 guy or Charlie Sheen or Randy Quaid or me sometimes whatever the I always like go\n\n01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:36.000\nLike like well, what's the real story here? What's going on because the last thing?\n\n01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:40.360\nI want to do is be a part of stuff of a gang of any kind\n\n01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:47.800\nIf it's easy to say what a nut bar. I always I was compelled to let go. What does he do in this video?\n\n01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:51.320\nOh, yeah, God. Well, you don't even you don't even you don't even know the headline of it\n\n01:06:51.320 --> 01:06:56.400\nI know I just saw that he made this and the wife's there, too. I presume. Yeah, the wife is there and she's in a bikini top\n\n01:06:56.400 --> 01:07:00.040\nShe's hanging out in the background and then it's worse\n\n01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:03.040\nShe's kind of glaring at the camera through aviator shades\n\n01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:08.000\nWell, he explains as he has before that Rupert Murdoch has it in for him and that he has never been\n\n01:07:08.360 --> 01:07:10.860\nthat he's been fucked over by this like kind of\n\n01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:17.320\nLarger system which we can talk about in a second exactly what his what what his theory is and why he has it\n\n01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:22.200\nBut he has this this this, you know, he feels he's been persecuted\n\n01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:26.240\nIt's a I went down the rabbit hole of going through the timeline of everything that's happened to him started in\n\n01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:31.640\n2007 cut to I don't have time to explain all of it, but cut to he's got no US passport\n\n01:07:31.640 --> 01:07:38.040\nAnd he's basically sitting in one room in Canada waiting to get either I guess put in jail in Canada or sent\n\n01:07:38.040 --> 01:07:42.720\nI don't know where he doesn't have a US passport. They took a Hillary Clinton took his passport away\n\n01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:44.720\nI don't think personally\n\n01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:51.440\nBecause you know John Kerry\n\n01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:56.760\nCalled me the other week and he wanted to take my passport away, but I don't don't give it to him\n\n01:07:57.200 --> 01:08:01.000\nExactly. It's a trick. I don't want to end up in Ontario in a fucking room with my wife\n\n01:08:01.080 --> 01:08:06.400\nSo he's never worn a bikini top in a video that I can remember so he does or he does a small rant\n\n01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:10.640\nSays like I hi, I'm Randy Quaid. I made\n\n01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:16.360\n20th Century Fox a billion dollars when I saved the world an independence day\n\n01:08:16.360 --> 01:08:21.280\nUm Rupert Murdoch is in return. What's happened?\n\n01:08:21.280 --> 01:08:27.880\nAnd he's just kind of recounts like he gets mad that Rupert Murdoch didn't thank him for saving the world an independence day at some point\n\n01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:32.880\nYeah, I mean he kind of that's you're worried about calling him a nut bar. Yeah, I am\n\n01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:38.040\nI understand what I'm worried about is not fun to pile on. I'm worried about calling him a\n\n01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:42.960\nDrug addict because I think that everyone keeps going like oh crystal meth crystal meth crystal meth\n\n01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:48.040\nLet he who is without drugs cast the first, you know only users\n\n01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:50.640\nOnly users lose drugs\n\n01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:55.960\nLet's all I feel like when I have a nervous breakdown you will part is that gonna happen tonight\n\n01:08:55.960 --> 01:08:57.440\nIt may have happened Wednesday\n\n01:08:57.440 --> 01:09:03.040\nYou don't know but part and parcel of my breakdown will be an increased use of whatever substances make no question\n\n01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:06.280\nNo, and so I always wonder when people me it's Tang\n\n01:09:06.280 --> 01:09:12.580\nHave these like they have these brush-ups with the press in the contemporary society and it's like oh the\n\n01:09:14.360 --> 01:09:17.280\nLike is the drug the causal agent because he's not\n\n01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:23.120\nEveryone says he's the sweetest guy in the world. Yeah, he's been married to his wife. Evie for since the 90s\n\n01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:26.360\nThey've always had a very passion. It's not a terrible actor. He's quite a good actor\n\n01:09:26.360 --> 01:09:30.440\nIt's very fabulously talented and they a great character actor and they\n\n01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:36.080\nThey hit and his marriage to you can't you can't Yoko the to to put it in Gen X\n\n01:09:36.280 --> 01:09:41.160\nParalyzed that she's not she's not the cause of any problems either like they've had a they've had a passionate\n\n01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:47.440\nPartnership since the 90s. She didn't come in and and start causing problems in his life\n\n01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:53.840\nIn 2007 shit just switched to like a light like stuff started going weird now\n\n01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:56.160\nUsually when you lose your mind\n\n01:09:56.160 --> 01:10:03.360\nstatistically, you're in your your your early 20s some some people could but but if you're in a marriage and it's a\n\n01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:09.520\nBiochemical thing you don't go crazy together. That's and there and he is not methed out\n\n01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:15.600\nHe is not he he's not he does not he's chubby and and ruddy-faced and healthy looking\n\n01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:21.160\nHe just seems to be really put out by what he claims is a is a global conspiracy\n\n01:10:21.160 --> 01:10:27.840\nHe's having a manic episode or something that's it was been lasting for like six years. Yeah, but sometimes they do, you know\n\n01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:31.440\nThat's what I that's that's what I look at Sinatra in the 50s or whatever, you know\n\n01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:34.360\nLike he made five million records or whatever, and I think you know\n\n01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:36.800\nI think he was up all night every night just like well\n\n01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:40.680\nThat's the biggest crime of all then as if Sinatra was as if we're missing Randy Quinn\n\n01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:42.680\nI\n\n01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:54.160\nWould hate to think that we're missing Randy quits best years then because well, I don't think we're missing\n\n01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:58.960\nIt's horrible when people pile on though and in turn send it from chasing Frankenstein to the village\n\n01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:01.600\nI don't know when the crime is being weird. It's like it's like well\n\n01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:07.440\nI think it's great when people gang up. I think the great thing about the internet is that we can gang up on bullies\n\n01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:11.880\nI think that's fucking great. Yeah, that's the best part. The weird thing is that we we just as though\n\n01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:14.120\nWe seem to keep ganging up on nerds like we just\n\n01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:20.280\nBrian Williams and shut that like really dude, but won't Hollywood throw their arms around him like they did Robert Downey and like like\n\n01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:23.280\nI hope so. Let's make you famous again, or what's his name?\n\n01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:25.120\nthe wrestler\n\n01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:27.760\nMickey Rourke Mickey Rourke. Yeah, I hope so. I\n\n01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:33.920\nMean he's he's he's he's aging really gracefully is a wonderful performers got this powerful voice. He's clearly off his rocker\n\n01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:41.720\nBut I don't even I don't want to use that phrase necessarily because it's like like like I don't know like like he's an actor\n\n01:11:41.720 --> 01:11:45.160\nHow sane is he supposed to be and exactly what the fuck happened?\n\n01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:52.040\nI don't know. I don't know. That's it. I feel like TMZ got him arrested six times is what happened to him\n\n01:11:52.160 --> 01:11:56.560\nThat's enough to make anyone, you know a little upset. He's freaky. There's no question\n\n01:11:56.560 --> 01:12:04.320\nSpencer, but you know my argument always is like Dick Cheney walks the streets free every day and feels fucking empowered to give his opinion\n\n01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:08.560\nAnytime he likes Donald Trump fucking comes on TV and tells us he's going to run for president\n\n01:12:08.560 --> 01:12:13.480\nSarah Palin gives speeches and shit like that and no one impunes their sanity at any point yet\n\n01:12:13.480 --> 01:12:15.480\nThey're all evil fucking insane\n\n01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:21.040\nUnbelievable unbalanced maniac. Yeah destroyed the world in their own fine way\n\n01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:29.760\nIf you took their money away by by by signing some form at City Hall that said that their jurisprudence wasn't the hall of bursars and the flim flim flam\n\n01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:31.640\nlike\n\n01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:38.040\nNothing looks crazier than being poor and having an opinion Donald Trump if he was fucking like he shuffled in here right now and had\n\n01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:42.320\nLike a rat tail on his cheek and said the shit that he says on Twitter\n\n01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:48.120\nI mean even just his\n\n01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:54.160\nOn your head yeah, yeah, like like just being born rich just gives you like this sanity pass\n\n01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:58.080\nOh, doesn't it just so I what I'm curious about is how they lost their money\n\n01:12:58.080 --> 01:13:01.800\nThat's the I don't say that because all their trouble started like\n\n01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:05.560\nHillary Clinton took away the passport and all of his gold\n\n01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:14.800\nWell, they're sitting up there in Canada and they're making videos you could you can follow every every every quade on Twitter\n\n01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:19.240\nShe has like a hundred and forty eight followers, and I saw like a hundred and forty eight\n\n01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:24.240\nYeah, they have like they have like these videos.

I\n\n01:30:58.400 --> 01:31:03.560\nYeah, the the the more stunned they are but when I get it within shooting range\n\n01:31:04.240 --> 01:31:06.960\nThe more alive they'll be tomorrow for their families\n\n01:31:12.200 --> 01:31:14.720\nThis is Aaron asking when we when we\n\n01:31:14.720 --> 01:31:22.000\nWhen we ended last time I had said to that group that they should stay and I was going to walk away\n\n01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:27.480\nAnd we ended on a cliffhanger. Am I still I felt like we were about to pull the triggers and shoot these guys\n\n01:31:27.480 --> 01:31:32.180\nLet's just shoot these fuckers. Let's just take them out. Yeah, I have walked away, but they're standing\n\n01:31:32.180 --> 01:31:34.840\nI totally vote for shooting if that's what we're doing\n\n01:31:35.840 --> 01:31:38.600\nAll right, I look I've got my my stick and shock\n\n01:31:41.360 --> 01:31:43.360\nBullets in my gun and I put it on\n\n01:31:43.360 --> 01:31:52.040\nLike like three-shot pulse mode. So how far away are you? I start closing that we start closing the gap\n\n01:31:52.040 --> 01:31:57.000\nMaybe you want to sneak up a bit? Yeah, I'm walking toward these guys until I can shoot them in the head. Okay\n\n01:31:57.640 --> 01:32:00.280\nWe're walking toward them until what's a good range to shoot that from?\n\n01:32:01.760 --> 01:32:05.040\nOn your pistols. Yeah, probably about 20 20 meters\n\n01:32:05.920 --> 01:32:09.720\nOkay, we close that we close that distance you do that quietly\n\n01:32:09.720 --> 01:32:12.520\nAll is well, okay\n\n01:32:13.200 --> 01:32:16.600\nGuys, let's just with the rifle.

Take the shot. Oh go take the shot. I shoot as many people as I can I\n\n01:34:16.300 --> 01:34:19.660\nPop pop pop I pick off my guy. All right.

Oh plus what plus your agility\n\n01:34:27.860 --> 01:34:29.860\nPlus ten ten\n\n01:34:30.180 --> 01:34:34.680\nMine's a total of nine. I remember. All right, you hit him directly in the chest\n\n01:34:35.100 --> 01:34:41.140\nIt goes it pierces straight through their armor for for Dan and knocks the guy on his floor\n\n01:34:41.140 --> 01:34:44.280\nHe's bleeding out the the other guy gets hit with three of your\n\n01:34:44.280 --> 01:34:51.940\nStick-in-shock rounds and you see some electrical activity as he goes down to the floor convulsing. There's one left\n\n01:34:52.760 --> 01:34:56.480\nQuarter guard take the shot. I take the shot with my rifle\n\n01:34:57.280 --> 01:35:00.080\nAll right, what's your agility plus the automatics?\n\n01:35:01.920 --> 01:35:03.920\nEight all right\n\n01:35:04.560 --> 01:35:07.440\nAll right, you also hit him his head explodes\n\n01:35:07.440 --> 01:35:17.000\nI shot as a pre-cog. I knew this would happen. This is why I took those actions. You sure you're not German\n\n01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000\nThe alarm's still going off\n\n01:35:22.280 --> 01:35:24.280\nHey face face Eve\n\n01:35:25.080 --> 01:35:28.680\nMercy you got a keyboard tape to your stomach\n\n01:35:29.320 --> 01:35:31.320\nCan you do something about that alarm?\n\n01:35:33.240 --> 01:35:35.640\nI can I can try I\n\n01:35:35.640 --> 01:35:42.680\nAm I'm still wearing my my my business wear. Yep. I I run inside. I\n\n01:35:43.480 --> 01:35:45.620\nTry to locate the alarm box\n\n01:35:45.960 --> 01:35:50.040\nAll right, you head inside the gatehouse and it's a pretty simple construction\n\n01:35:50.040 --> 01:35:56.080\nYou think there you see a switch that's activated that looks to be the alarm. That's probably it. Hello my darling\n\n01:35:58.920 --> 01:36:02.720\nI walk up to the alarm and I\n\n01:36:02.720 --> 01:36:04.560\nI\n\n01:36:04.560 --> 01:36:08.680\nUsing my my attribute my attribute of composure. Mm-hmm. I\n\n01:36:10.320 --> 01:36:15.880\nI'm calm and I try to make sense of the alarm. I try to flip off the alarm using your composure\n\n01:36:15.880 --> 01:36:20.440\nYou flip off the alarm the silence rains and also\n\n01:36:21.120 --> 01:36:23.120\ntear gas\n\n01:36:24.600 --> 01:36:26.960\nSorry about the mess, but it's quiet\n\n01:36:28.160 --> 01:36:30.160\nto quiet\n\n01:36:30.160 --> 01:36:36.440\nWe still have that one guard inside that I only stunned you do it's nightblade you blew a dude's head off in there\n\n01:36:36.840 --> 01:36:40.440\nWe have with that one guy still down Spencer. Do we know how long that's done lasts on them?\n\n01:36:40.840 --> 01:36:44.280\nYou know an hour or two a few hours. Okay, so he's good. Probably\n\n01:36:45.280 --> 01:36:52.080\nCan I still get a room back in there? That's probably where the target is and we gotta we gotta check all these crates for those chips\n\n01:36:52.080 --> 01:36:56.480\nYou hear the sound of sliding metal as the loading bay door closes shut\n\n01:36:57.200 --> 01:36:59.040\nbehind you\n\n01:36:59.040 --> 01:37:00.480\nprobably\n\n01:37:00.480 --> 01:37:02.480\nDepending on your orientation\n\n01:37:06.960 --> 01:37:11.360\nAnd the loading the loading dock door is the only door into the warehouse well\n\n01:37:11.920 --> 01:37:16.160\nYou guys came in through the ceiling right, but is there another door that we found or no?\n\n01:37:17.240 --> 01:37:22.400\nNot one that I'm aware of all right, so again, I'm sure that's the only door\n\n01:37:22.400 --> 01:37:30.800\nI'll go down the chimney and then I run up and yeah grapple grapple up to the\n\n01:37:31.400 --> 01:37:35.200\nGrapple up to their warehouse roof. All right, you do that. I\n\n01:37:36.320 --> 01:37:40.360\nAsteroidly perceive I go into a shamanic trance and I asteroidly project myself\n\n01:37:41.280 --> 01:37:47.560\nAnd I project myself inside the warehouse to go into the room where those machines were and see or just to check check out the whole space\n\n01:37:47.560 --> 01:37:54.160\nAll right, you see about six bodies inside surrounded by machines and our security devices\n\n01:37:55.040 --> 01:38:00.600\nSix bodies in the main room in the in the room that you haven't entered yet. Okay guys and\n\n01:38:01.680 --> 01:38:06.840\nI do I detect any any magic any spirits in there or just just regular human being just humans all right guys\n\n01:38:06.840 --> 01:38:08.840\nIt's that we got six bodies inside that room\n\n01:38:08.840 --> 01:38:20.160\nWell, it's a little outside my jurisdiction Six bodies are they dead?\n\n01:38:20.720 --> 01:38:22.240\nNo, they're living\n\n01:38:22.240 --> 01:38:25.160\nCan I use my ability to detect enemies?\n\n01:38:25.800 --> 01:38:28.680\nYeah, range. No you detect enemies\n\n01:38:29.600 --> 01:38:31.600\nYou detect enemies\n\n01:38:32.440 --> 01:38:34.440\nThere's there's five plus\n\n01:38:34.440 --> 01:38:40.720\nIn the building so that means that everyone in that room neither one of them is the person. We're seeking\n\n01:38:42.240 --> 01:38:48.160\nI mean, it's not really been established whether the person you see you're seeking as an ally or an enemy\n\n01:38:48.160 --> 01:38:53.520\nSo nobody's in the in the outside of the warehouse. They're all inside that room correct. All right guys\n\n01:38:53.520 --> 01:38:57.080\nI'm gonna go in there. Let's all go in together. Let's let's have each other's back here\n\n01:38:57.080 --> 01:38:58.960\nI'm gonna go in there before we do this\n\n01:38:58.960 --> 01:39:05.160\nShould I perhaps take this opportunity to take my rifle to the stunned one than maybe shoot him? Yeah, I'll do that\n\n01:39:05.160 --> 01:39:09.040\nWell, you'd have to get in the building first. So how do you want to do that?\n\n01:39:09.960 --> 01:39:11.960\nLet's see. I have a grappling gun\n\n01:39:14.040 --> 01:39:18.760\nWhy don't we just why don't we just just monofilaments that uh that that door open man?\n\n01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:24.240\nYeah, we'll be long gone by the time I wake up Spencer. How does my stealth tag work?\n\n01:39:24.240 --> 01:39:29.560\nUm, that's like an RFID tag. It's like a tracking bug basically so you could stick it on stuff\n\n01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:34.880\nAll right, another time. Is there time to let a cigarette while all this bullshit's going on?\n\n01:39:37.160 --> 01:39:39.960\nNightblade monofilament that door open. Let's go in there\n\n01:39:39.960 --> 01:39:45.440\nWhat I'll do is all I I can summon a spirit that goes in there and just knocks it like knocks them out with noxious gas or something like that\n\n01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000\nWinky doodle do\n\n01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:53.480\nIt's not not a permanent I'm workshop and catchphrases\n\n01:39:56.360 --> 01:39:59.480\nSpencer am I am I in a space with one of those guards?\n\n01:40:00.600 --> 01:40:02.800\nYou're in the gatehouse. There's\n\n01:40:04.040 --> 01:40:06.280\nThere's a dead guard in it. Yeah, okay\n\n01:40:06.280 --> 01:40:11.480\nI take the dead guards clothes and I put on his clothes and I'm gonna use my skill of disguise to\n\n01:40:11.480 --> 01:40:18.000\nKind of emulate his body language. All right. What's your? Yeah, what?\n\n01:40:18.320 --> 01:40:20.320\nWhat's your intuition plus disguise?\n\n01:40:21.560 --> 01:40:25.480\nMy intuition is four and my disguise is three\n\n01:40:27.160 --> 01:40:29.640\nSeven all right you don't have to disguise\n\n01:40:33.320 --> 01:40:37.600\nAll right, and I start walking towards the room all right meanwhile\n\n01:40:37.600 --> 01:40:42.360\nJim nightblade attempts to monofilament whip the door open\n\n01:40:44.480 --> 01:40:51.440\nBut your robot finger careens off the surface of the door directing your monofilament whip directly right at you\n\n01:40:51.440 --> 01:40:54.280\nNo, it slashes you. What's your armor?\n\n01:40:58.480 --> 01:41:00.480\nTop right corner top right\n\n01:41:00.480 --> 01:41:07.440\nIs it AP or what I'll say armors my old eyes. It's\n\n01:41:08.320 --> 01:41:13.440\nArmors, I'm looking for the word armors and it's core combat info up top right\n\n01:41:13.480 --> 01:41:20.880\nIt's just the number to the topist rightist.
