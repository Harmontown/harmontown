00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
From Meltdown Comics, Hollywood, California, Harmontown is now in session.

00:10.000 --> 00:20.000
Please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
Thank you.

00:24.000 --> 00:31.000
Thank you very much. Very enthusiastic. Very good people.

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
Thank you for not going to the Grammys. Thank you so much.

00:34.000 --> 00:40.000
I know a lot of you are nominated and you just decided to check the results later.

00:40.000 --> 00:45.000
Yeah, I got my eye-harmed back. Aaron made me a quickie for a shadow run tonight.

00:45.000 --> 00:49.000
We haven't figured out. I don't want to talk about that.

00:49.000 --> 01:01.000
We haven't figured out how to make these devices in our pockets usable on the level of a notepad yet.

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
It still hasn't happened. I'm 42 fucking years old. That's all I'm going to say about it.

01:05.000 --> 01:11.000
It's still easier to have a piece of paper around your neck. It shouldn't be.

01:11.000 --> 01:21.000
At the peak of the Palm Trio, I remember I was typing really fast with my thumbs.

01:21.000 --> 01:26.000
Then this iPhone thing happened. It's wonderful. It's a great looking thing.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
You can touch the screen and move it around.

01:28.000 --> 01:34.000
But if you add it up all of the time that we spend going back and correcting all the words,

01:34.000 --> 01:44.000
boy, Jeff, second life. Did any extra black people come tonight?

01:44.000 --> 01:54.000
What's your name, sir? Brian? Anybody else?

01:54.000 --> 02:02.000
You better not be white. You better be genuinely black. That's only funny if you're black.

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
No, it's funny both ways. No, it's not. It's not funny if he's white.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
It's hilarious if he's white. No, it's not.

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
Imagine if Jim Belushi is doing that in the back. That's not funny.

02:12.000 --> 02:21.000
He's doing a black guy impression. It's funny if it's tiny Lister Jr.

02:21.000 --> 02:25.000
There's no middle ground between those? No, there's lots of middle ground.

02:25.000 --> 02:31.000
It's also funny if it's just any black guy. What is your name back there? Max?

02:31.000 --> 02:42.000
Are you in the military at some point with the yes sir or no?

02:42.000 --> 02:46.000
See now, it's way funny if that guy's white.

02:46.000 --> 02:52.000
It's starting to get okay if he's white. Because it's a dimensionalized character.

02:52.000 --> 02:57.000
It's not just an impression of a race. It's becoming a character.

02:57.000 --> 03:08.000
So it's becoming fine. He's becoming Tracy Oldman if he's white.

03:08.000 --> 03:14.000
Max, what do you do for a living?

03:14.000 --> 03:23.000
What sort of performances do you do Max?

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
I'll take it however I want to take it Max.

03:26.000 --> 03:30.000
Are you willing to come up on stage and feel it out with us?

03:30.000 --> 03:35.000
Welcome Max to the stage everybody.

03:35.000 --> 03:41.000
This show really got off right out of the gate like a rocket.

03:41.000 --> 03:51.000
Alright, cross your fingers. This guy better be black as hell.

03:51.000 --> 03:57.000
Yeah, black enough.

03:57.000 --> 04:01.000
Awesome, hello.

04:01.000 --> 04:05.000
Now you can grab one of those and have a seat.

04:05.000 --> 04:15.000
Yeah, microphone and a seat. Just as promised you your people in the 1940s.

04:15.000 --> 04:21.000
So did you come because last week I pled for more black people?

04:21.000 --> 04:25.000
No.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
Do you have the blackest voice ever?

04:28.000 --> 04:32.000
It's me and James Earl Jones.

04:32.000 --> 04:36.000
Every year we just kind of see who can go more bass.

04:36.000 --> 04:41.000
I'm getting there. When I was 13 it was close but now he's starting to lose it.

04:41.000 --> 04:47.000
Can you sing a low note? I wish I could. I love like bass singers.

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
This is me.

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
Get lower than that.

04:53.000 --> 04:59.000
Okay, hold on.

04:59.000 --> 05:09.000
There's such a fine line between post-racial and pre-menstrual humor.

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
How would you like me to perform? Let's bring him up.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
How low is your voice?

05:15.000 --> 05:20.000
It's a hair's breadth. What are we doing?

05:20.000 --> 05:25.000
We're talking about a gentleman with a great basso profundo voice.

05:25.000 --> 05:30.000
I'm not indicting us. I'm just pointing out what a razor's edge we walk in the modern world

05:30.000 --> 05:36.000
and how far you go to just find yourself back at fascination with each other.

05:36.000 --> 05:44.000
I feel bad for Brian. Is Brian right? The first guy, he got supplanted by Maxie.

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
There was just good comedy.

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
What was the first? It was just a voice from the back.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
Yeah, I'm here.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
It was just good.

05:54.000 --> 06:00.000
Brian can come up too but I don't want to feel like we're pitting people against each other.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
Only one black person at a time.

06:02.000 --> 06:09.000
I can feel you presence though.

06:09.000 --> 06:14.000
Brian, do you also want to come up or do you not want to be dehumanized like this?

06:14.000 --> 06:20.000
Brian, get your ass up here, Brian.

06:20.000 --> 06:24.000
Okay, alright.

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
Alright.

06:27.000 --> 06:35.000
Man, I'm so excited. Just for that random, I wish that there was still television

06:35.000 --> 06:42.000
so someone could be flipping through channels and see me hanging out.

06:42.000 --> 06:50.000
All my white guilt is just being sucked off the range through a super vacuum out into the stratosphere.

06:50.000 --> 06:55.000
I love it. All the heat from being a 42-year-old fat white oppressor.

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
Now I just feel like I'm fucking on honest ground.

06:59.000 --> 07:04.000
What should we talk about? Randy Quaid?

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
Is he in the news?

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
Yeah, I think he's doing something.

07:09.000 --> 07:13.000
Brian, sorry, I didn't know enough about me.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
What do you do for a living?

07:16.000 --> 07:20.000
I work at a Jamba Juice.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
Sounds like you're making it up a little bit.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
It's terrible.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
And they're not watching or anything?

07:27.000 --> 07:33.000
No, nobody at that Jamba Juice would ever watch a podcast or listen to it or anything.

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
What's the worst thing about working at a Jamba Juice?

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
The people.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
The coworkers or the customers?

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
The customers for sure.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
Juice isn't that important. It's not.

07:46.000 --> 07:50.000
There's a lot of things going on in the world. Juice is not the important thing.

07:50.000 --> 07:55.000
By the time you've already decided that you don't even need solid food,

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
you should be an easygoing person when you come into this.

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
The worst thing that happened to you is that you're juice is five minutes late.

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
You have a fucking great life. It's fantastic.

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
So you're saying they're a little impatient and bossy?

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
Yeah, just generally assholes.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
How old are you? Can I ask your young enough?

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
I'm 23.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
Young enough to be able to ask?

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
23.

08:16.000 --> 08:21.000
Ah, pre-9-11.

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
You haven't even been through 9-11 yet.

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
Is that how age works?

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
Oh, we all experience time with this.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
Okay, alright.

08:32.000 --> 08:39.000
Sorry, I thought all of us had to turn 32 for 9-11 to happen.

08:39.000 --> 08:43.000
Max, you said you're a performer. What do you do?

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
I'm an actor.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
You're an actor?

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
Are you working on stuff?

08:47.000 --> 08:51.000
I just relocated to Los Angeles three days ago, four days ago.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
Welcome.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
From where?

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
From New York.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
From New York? Wow.

08:57.000 --> 09:01.000
Man, this is an authentic black person.

09:01.000 --> 09:10.000
This isn't like one of your black friends who doesn't know any other black people.

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
I bet you know a ton of black people, don't you?

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
I went to school with a bunch of them. Acting.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
Black acting school.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
No, okay.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
Alright, I pushed it too far.

09:21.000 --> 09:25.000
I thought it was like, there was a show when I was a kid called Fame.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
It was about acting.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
Yeah, I remember Fame. It was about LaGuardia.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
LaGuardia in New York City is a school.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
Yeah, that's not where you went, right?

09:33.000 --> 09:37.000
No, but I know some black actors that went to LaGuardia.

09:37.000 --> 09:40.000
I think it was Irene Caro?

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
Was that the actress's name?

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
She sang the song.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
Oh, okay.

09:44.000 --> 09:48.000
In the title sequence, there was an actor who was one of the teachers.

09:48.000 --> 09:52.000
I think first there was a movie with the song.

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
I don't know if the movie was an adaptation of the song.

09:55.000 --> 10:00.000
But then the TV show, and then the credits for the TV show and the opening title sequence,

10:00.000 --> 10:04.000
there was just this woman saying, you want Fame? You want success?

10:04.000 --> 10:08.000
Well, right here is where you start paying in sweat.

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
And it was just a show about talented high school kids.

10:11.000 --> 10:14.000
In the movie, that's where Coco takes her shirt off and cries.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
Oh, yeah, yeah.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
You want Fame? Fame costs. Right now is where you start paying.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
Oh, you know what I'm talking about.

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
When I was a kid, I was at MGM, which is now Sony Lot.

10:22.000 --> 10:26.000
I think I was shooting something, like Highway to Heaven or something.

10:26.000 --> 10:30.000
Me and my mom were walking down between the sound stages,

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
and a golf cart goes by, and on the back of the golf cart,

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
we're walking, and on the back of the golf cart going past us,

10:36.000 --> 10:40.000
I forget the actor's name, but he played Leroy on Fame.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
Who's that fucking great dancer, remember him?

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
Oh, yeah. Do you have cornrows?

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
Kind of, yeah, I think. And he waved at me like he knew me.

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
He pointed at me and waved, and my mom's like,

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
why is Leroy waving at you?

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
I go, I think Leroy thinks he knows me.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
I felt so cool.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
Max, you want to drink? You were looking...

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
I was eyeing it, but...

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
You got to help yourself, though.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
I don't want to dig in the ice with my hands for you.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
Thank you.

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
So, Brian, are you from LA?

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
No, I'm from New Orleans originally,

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
but I live in Oakland.

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
I just came down here to help a friend move

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
and to see Harmontown.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
Really? Yeah.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
You helped somebody move, and you came to a different town to do it?

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
Yes. You're a good person.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
Yeah, good friend.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
I really like convenience, also.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
Brian, did you want to drink?

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
Yeah.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
Harmon's become bartender. I love this.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
We really do need, like...

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
Dan Harmon is making me a drink. This is amazing.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
Yeah, it's like...

11:40.000 --> 11:44.000
It's like really the kid cleaning your gun.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
That's exactly what I was thinking.

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
It's like Patrick Swayze packing your parachute.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
Or teaching me how to dance.

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
It's like Santa Claus sitting on your lap.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
There you go.

11:59.000 --> 12:04.000
I group around the bullseye, and then the professional improviser...

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
By the way, we have Greg Proops here tonight.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
He'll be coming up on that.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
Yeah!

12:11.000 --> 12:15.000
Inarguably a white man, but...

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
Although, when you get Greg drunk,

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
when Greg gets just drunk and high enough,

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
he becomes a black jazz musician from 1933.

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
He's a very groovy white man.

12:24.000 --> 12:27.000
He becomes incredibly like a jazz musician. It's very good.

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
All right, so we've got Max, the aspiring performer.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
So you're very young, too. What are you, 20...

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
Can I ask?

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
Yeah, 27.

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
So, out here from New York...

12:39.000 --> 12:43.000
It sounds like he's doing a bit sometimes.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
Just came here from New York,

12:45.000 --> 12:49.000
so now what is the plight of a young actor in LA in 2015?

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
How does it work? Does it still look the same?

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
You still got a pile of headshots in your back seat,

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
and you just kind of...

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
It's all digital now. I don't know about...

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
Yeah, LinkedIn.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
Yeah, now it's just...

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
So, is there... Do you have an agent?

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
I have a manager.

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
Is there... Does your manager say stuff like,

13:11.000 --> 13:15.000
you know, you got to do that YouTube now?

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
He's a New Yorker, so...

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
He does kind of talk like that.

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
He has an old New York Jewish accent.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
You're about to...

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
I just... I touched my iPad.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
That's not a bit. I just touched my thing.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
We were about to kick a freestyle.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
That was unintentional, but if you'd like to,

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
that can happen.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
I'm not allowed to solicit that from you,

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
but you are...

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
You don't have to say a word

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
if you would like to do some freestyle rapping.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
That is fine by me.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
Yeah, do you want to...

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
Do you want to battle?

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
Isn't that... I mean, that's what they call it.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
Max.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
Yeah.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
See, Max seems pretty down with that.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
Ryan, are you up for that?

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
Um...

14:12.000 --> 14:15.000
I'm more of a manager type.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
Brian, Brian, it's like...

14:17.000 --> 14:20.000
I'm literally up here because of the color of my skin.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
He said he wanted to rap, and they're going to rap.

14:22.000 --> 14:25.000
Brian, I need you to go around and just collect money from people.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
We're going to accept bets.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
So, money, give me a hat, please.

14:28.000 --> 14:31.000
We need to collect. We need $5 ahead.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
And...

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
I think there should be some stakes for the winner of this battle.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
I think there should be like...

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
All right, well, I mean, I have...

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
I can make a cash.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
All right.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
You're throwing out money, then.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
All right, I'll join.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
All right, I got 20 here.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
Is that good?

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
I have a 22, so...

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
Bring your 20 over here, Harmon.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
Give it to me.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
Brian, can you hand that to me?

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
All right.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
So, the kitty...

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
The kitty is $40.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
We're going to do it democratically by applause

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
at the end of this thing,

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
but we're going to do a good old-fashioned rap battle.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
I think...

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
I think in a rap battle...

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
I think by applause is...

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
That's for...

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
Correct me if I'm wrong, Max.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
The whole by applause thing...

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
That's a white people Halloween party thing.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
In a real rap battle...

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
You know who won.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
They don't need to...

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
I think it'll be obvious.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
We'll know who won when we know.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
It's...

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
Everyone goes like...

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
Oh!

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
Oh!

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
Like, it's like...

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
It hurts them.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
I'm not trying to impute your rapping ability,

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
but do you think you have that in you right now

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
to elicit that sort of reaction tonight?

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
Well, I don't know. I don't know.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
For me, it's like...

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
It's not up to me. It's up to God.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
Right?

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
Because I don't want to pull rank,

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
but I feel like that's

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
what comes through me when I work

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
in any capacity.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
And now, Brian, as soon as money got involved,

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
you seem to like...

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
You're into it now. I'm very poor.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
You have $40.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
You're going to quit that Jamba Juice.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
No.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
I'm out!

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
All right.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
So, I mean, is there any rules to like...

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
I don't know.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
I've never been in a three-person...

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
I was joking.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
I'm going to go one more...

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
I've got a very good rapper.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
I'm going to go one more 20, make it 60.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
$60.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
If anyone else wants to make donations for this,

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
for our rappers right here...

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
We'll be passing around a hat in a couple minutes.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
Okay, so how does this work?

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
Are there ground rules in this?

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
Like, what's the thing? I'll just throw a beat down

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
and you guys want to just take it?

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
Yeah, I guess.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
I have a problem.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
Sometimes, like, I don't...

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
I don't hand it off soon enough.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
Because sometimes the shit just flowing.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
All right.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
I don't even know if I would have

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
given myself into right now, man.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
Ugh.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
All right. It's going to be terrible

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
no matter what happens.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
The stakes are low.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
So, let's just freestyle.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
Let's just feel it out. You guys just do your thing.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
I got some new beats today

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
that I found from some of our donation

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
Armenian music.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
Oh, yeah. If you know the name of the artist,

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
give them some credit.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
The opening song was by a cat named Lee Broderick

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
called Love the Street. I really like that song.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
So thank you, Lee.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
If you got more stuff, send it to us.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
It was very cool.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
We don't have to call it a battle.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
Yeah.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
The Sugar Hill gang didn't battle

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
each other. They were a gang.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
There's no animosity, no enmity.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
This is just creative collaboration.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
I think rap battling is

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
along with

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
liquor stores

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
and pawn shops

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
and Laysay fair

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
gun legislation

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
and horoscopes and scratch-off tickets

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
are

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
all part of the white man's

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
conspiracy.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
Sounds like a lot of backpedaling from you, man.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
I'm backpedaling

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
on the white man's conspiracy.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
I feel bad that we ever initiated it.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
I wish that we could take it back.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
During this rap battle,

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
don't use that word battle.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
Don't even put it in quotes.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
It's a powerful word.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
This is a post-racial cooperative

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
rap co-op.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
But there will be one winner.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
Somebody will win.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
This is America.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
The rap will go to...

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
Okay.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
They're not saying the winner is anyone.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
You're all

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
honored just to be up on stage doing it, for certain.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
But what person will

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
walk home with 60 US dollars?

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
Well, yes. That's true.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
But I don't think we have to call that person

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
a better rapper than me.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
I think we absolutely do.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
I think when the person

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
who has the 60 dollars can say

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
among these three rappers,

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
I am the best.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
Are you in on this rap battle?

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
It's not a battle.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
It's like collaboration.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
I mean, I'm up here.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
I'm going to be real bad at it.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
I feel like Brian's

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
he's going to sneak in there and do it.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
He's the sleeper.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
I promise you I'm not.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
I'm going to keep you guys honest.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
When we start this rap battle, just in case.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
Just in case.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
You guys had some prepared material.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
I'm going to solicit a suggestion.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
I'll keep it vague.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
Something very broad.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
As a starting point.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
All right, Randy Quinn.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
All right.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
I'm going to play a couple beats.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
We'd like to use here.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
How about?

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
Yeah.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
Like that?

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
Yeah.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
Yeah.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
Yeah.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
Yeah.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
Yeah, streets to the

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
streets to the week.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
All right.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
You sir, right here.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
That was just warming up.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
You sir.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
What's something that you have as a pet peeve of yours?

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
Something that bothers you?

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
Something mundane maybe?

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
To the week, streets to the week.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
Whistling on the street

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
bothers the gentleman.

20:35.000 --> 20:42.580
Whistling on the street street whistlers. Yeah, okay. Okay. All right. Okay, MC Harmon coming to it

20:43.520 --> 20:49.300
Yo, why you got a walk down the sidewalk doing that high tone like it's bird talk

20:50.180 --> 20:52.180
Why you whistling at me?

20:52.340 --> 20:54.940
Fuck your mama so hard. She took a pee. I

20:55.980 --> 21:00.660
Pulled your mama's pants down said but pushes whistling. She's like a clown

21:00.660 --> 21:06.300
Clowns don't whistle. They use seltzer bottles. I fucked your mama so hard full throttle

21:07.620 --> 21:09.620
Went down the street

21:10.460 --> 21:12.460
Squeezed your mama's titty me

21:13.380 --> 21:18.300
He gave her a kiss because in the end she's a good person. That's the mic go

21:24.820 --> 21:27.420
All right, keep it going keep the beat going man

21:27.420 --> 21:31.700
The song's not long enough for all three to get through so I do you want to see you want to keep that beat?

21:31.700 --> 21:33.700
Who wants to go next max you have

21:35.460 --> 21:41.100
You like that beat you want a new beat. Yeah new beat us. No same beat new topic new topic

21:41.940 --> 21:45.420
Let's see you just you just fucked somebody's mama in so many ways

21:46.420 --> 21:51.340
Thank you the one whistling they were that's they were the mother of the person what something that's embarrassing

21:51.340 --> 21:53.340
I

21:55.660 --> 21:58.620
Feelings feelings feelings feelings all right

22:00.380 --> 22:02.380
Go max yo

22:03.300 --> 22:10.300
Feelings yeah, I got these feelings man. It's awkwardness. I'm on stage and I'm not the blackest kid

22:10.300 --> 22:17.180
But still I'm kind of in the middle kind of trying to spit this rap shit. It's a riddle. It's a mystery

22:17.180 --> 22:23.060
But it's not the new to me. It's not a diss track, but I feel like you've been kisses to Dan Harmon. Yo

22:26.780 --> 22:28.780
Yo, yeah

22:30.940 --> 22:32.940
Bombin

22:33.980 --> 22:35.980
Harmon with that

22:37.660 --> 22:39.660
Yo

22:39.660 --> 22:48.020
Feeling kind of homophobic though because it's distracting me with my flow, but still I gotta go your beard. Yo, it's kind of weird

22:48.180 --> 22:51.260
If you was a chick and you had a dick I

22:52.220 --> 22:55.420
Say yes, kind of dick, but I gotta get a minute

22:56.100 --> 22:58.100
Anyway, yeah

22:59.380 --> 23:00.900
All right

23:00.900 --> 23:02.900
Well, that was that took a

23:02.900 --> 23:13.020
That took an unexpected turn max The title of that one is truly feelings

23:15.780 --> 23:20.620
That's right. I was like the Charlie Kaufman of like of like

23:21.140 --> 23:25.540
Freestyle cuz they like use the medium like the rap became a feeling

23:25.540 --> 23:35.340
Yeah, all right, Brian the the bar has been maybe raised you want the same beat when I try a new beat you like that one

23:36.340 --> 23:40.420
Your choice we you can hear one. Let's see what else we got here. What about

23:40.420 --> 23:51.300
A little more smooth. Let's see when the beat comes in. I feel like this

23:55.420 --> 23:57.420
Do you like this

24:01.700 --> 24:05.700
Really doesn't matter same results no matter the beat

24:05.700 --> 24:07.700
Oh

24:11.140 --> 24:13.140
Shit

24:14.460 --> 24:19.500
I just go back to the first one right you like which one that's safer the first one the very first the one they did

24:21.500 --> 24:26.540
You good to go let's get him a suggestion. Sure. What about what?

24:29.420 --> 24:31.420
White no not white devil

24:31.420 --> 24:36.900
Unless you wanted you what how about just can we how about just juice we'll give you juice

Yeah, if you want to see a movie you're gonna see it. That's how Netflix sees it

26:14.220 --> 26:18.100
They're a business model remember when I fucked your mama full throttle

26:19.140 --> 26:24.540
Well, oh shit. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Whoa. Yeah. Oh syncopated

She had a schism between her legs. It's usually called a pussy

26:32.340 --> 26:36.140
But I digress sorry about that

26:37.620 --> 26:43.460
Pass it pass the mic. I'm gonna pass the mic to another person

26:45.980 --> 26:48.860

Pass it up. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All right. It's heating up here you guys. You know, yeah

27:20.020 --> 27:22.020
Netflix caught me masturbating

27:22.660 --> 27:24.660

27:30.620 --> 27:34.220
Yeah, take it home. Go home out. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

27:35.140 --> 27:37.140
Arrested development is coming back

27:37.900 --> 27:45.420
Episodes get longer. It's like crack. You gotta smoke one at a time, but serialized jokes. So you get it rhyme

27:46.780 --> 27:48.780
You'll notice

27:48.780 --> 27:55.060
All right, I've got a pass the bike to Max

27:56.580 --> 27:59.300
The two blacks now nice

28:00.580 --> 28:04.780
Harmon it's a dehumanizing when you call someone a color

28:05.620 --> 28:07.620
Calling one of the color

28:09.060 --> 28:12.540
I'm a bit of a misstep. Yeah. Oh, yeah

28:12.540 --> 28:19.740
Okay, yeah, that's name Harmon. I don't know what that should mean, but

28:20.580 --> 28:23.860
It's white. I won't say what rhymes with white

28:23.940 --> 28:28.340
But still, you know what it's like to be on stage and get called put on blasts

28:29.060 --> 28:34.820
Sometimes I watch Netflix for hours. Just trying to pick the show. I don't know what to do

28:34.820 --> 28:36.820
I read all the titles and

28:37.420 --> 28:39.420
They all sound interesting so

28:39.420 --> 28:41.420
I

28:43.340 --> 28:45.340
Bring it home Brent

28:46.540 --> 28:51.260
Netflix I don't know what the watch Netflix why am I touching the crotch?

28:52.860 --> 28:55.980
Netflix what the fuck is going on? I

28:56.580 --> 28:59.140
Can't even see her phone. Is this

29:02.420 --> 29:04.420
All right, all right

29:04.420 --> 29:09.180
All right $60 worth of wrapping I feel like I

29:10.620 --> 29:12.820
Feel like shit almost got too real there

29:13.500 --> 29:16.540
We're in danger of crossing the dangerous reality

29:16.540 --> 29:21.940
We definitely made connections tonight and I think made a good case for more black people coming to my show

29:21.940 --> 29:28.260
I think we just fixed racism. Yeah, well, I mean and it's surprising how little time it took we've been working on it forever

29:28.300 --> 29:31.660
It's like let me out there. Let me take care of this

29:31.660 --> 29:37.620
Is there any since you guys were so gracious and and you know put yourselves out out there?

29:37.620 --> 29:45.060
Is there anything I mean usually we ask the professional people what they're plugging, but you guys are plugging your your young lives

29:45.780 --> 29:51.580
If anybody out there's hiring people who don't have any experience writing television shoes

29:53.140 --> 29:54.820
Please call me

29:54.820 --> 30:01.820
All right, you can go to Brian's Jamba Juice or and you go to your nearest Jamba Juice and ask for me you can you can

30:01.820 --> 30:04.460
Only black person that works at any Jamba Juice ever

30:05.900 --> 30:07.900
Max

30:09.020 --> 30:14.700
If there's a if there's a guy sitting in Seattle that goes that's it. That's the new face of Chipotle

30:18.420 --> 30:20.420
You're correct sir

30:20.420 --> 30:26.860
All right, yeah, and he can find you on LinkedIn or whatever. All right, so now how do we decide this now as now?

30:26.860 --> 30:31.220
This is the oh, well, I mean, I think they I think it's a tie between the two guys that

30:32.900 --> 30:34.900
Who's whose money it isn't I?

30:37.180 --> 30:39.820
I mean, I'm not gonna take my own money, but I clearly won

30:43.620 --> 30:45.620
My my shit was tight

30:45.620 --> 30:49.380
I'm gonna say you came in a very close third then

30:50.460 --> 30:53.220
Very close third. Yeah beat out Eminem

30:53.740 --> 30:56.020
We don't we don't need to decide between the two of them, right?

30:56.020 --> 31:01.420
We can just split the 60 among the two guys that I made it even 80 how about top of 40 for both of them?

31:01.420 --> 31:02.920
Is that cool?

31:02.920 --> 31:04.420
All right

31:04.420 --> 31:06.420
All right, that buys a lot of

31:07.020 --> 31:09.020
Jamba Juice and a lot of I

31:09.940 --> 31:11.940
Don't know acting tutorials

31:11.940 --> 31:15.340
Yeah, just met Chipotle burritos. This goes to rent

31:16.460 --> 31:18.460
All right. Well, thanks max. Thanks, Brian

31:21.940 --> 31:27.180
Keep coming back and bring bring friends. They can be white friends

31:30.140 --> 31:35.700
It's working Jeff it's working this show brought to you by Jamba Juice I

31:35.700 --> 31:42.300
Bet you thought it was absurd when I asked for I just requested black people to come to the show

31:42.300 --> 31:45.320
I mean you thought I was silly. You thought I was racist

31:48.180 --> 31:50.180
Racist like a fox

31:55.980 --> 32:01.820
I'm bringing back a pre-racial that's that's my movement

32:01.820 --> 32:09.020
Pre-racial so you live in a time before racism really kicked off. Yeah, it's race is an artificial construct

32:09.020 --> 32:11.020
But that's why it's so fascinating

32:11.180 --> 32:15.460
Like remember Jamal Jamal's not here. Is he Jamal you here? He would have spoke up

32:15.460 --> 32:19.520
I was I wanted to talk to Jamal at the end of the show last time

32:20.020 --> 32:25.100
Because he was sort of the quintessential like post-racial kid like he looked like he was about 12 years old

32:25.100 --> 32:31.660
Very adorable very very bored with my racial obsession making fun of me like kind of

32:31.980 --> 32:35.460
Just like didn't need it had no use for the consciousness of race

32:35.500 --> 32:40.180
Like it would be fun to have him come up every week and just check in with him do a post-racial update

32:40.500 --> 32:42.500
And he would just say I had a sandwich today

32:44.060 --> 32:45.900
What kind?

32:45.900 --> 32:55.740
All right. Well, that was a that was a strange detour, but that's what Harmon sounds about. It's about magic. Oh

32:55.740 --> 32:57.100
I think we've proven that

32:57.100 --> 33:01.580
if our next guest had anything to say about it, he'd probably say the show is about

33:02.660 --> 33:05.660
Waiting a long time for weird raps to happen

33:06.980 --> 33:08.980
Let's bring out Greg Proops

33:08.980 --> 33:10.980
Yeah

33:14.380 --> 33:18.060
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

33:19.500 --> 33:21.500
Greg Proops

33:24.500 --> 33:26.500
I'm a beamer smoke and whack

33:28.820 --> 33:32.180
Just watching Netflix, it's the orange to the black. Yeah

33:32.180 --> 33:38.340
But I can't watch yahoo with impunity because that's the place that they got community. I

33:41.860 --> 33:43.860
Had time to think it up

33:44.380 --> 33:46.540
You could have made all I fucking came up with

33:47.180 --> 33:52.020
You could have made yourself 40 cool dollars man. I know man, and then I could have quit my job and shit

33:53.300 --> 33:56.460
How are you Pripy? Oh, you went to mice. I'm good. Yeah, I do. Thank you

33:56.460 --> 34:02.300
I like that you came out and brought a brand new bottle of vodka. I was asked by two people backstage if I might do so and I

34:02.300 --> 34:06.020
Aque asked to both of them one after the next the first guy went when you go out there

34:06.020 --> 34:08.380
Well, you bring a bottle of alcohol. Yeah, two seconds later another guy went

34:08.380 --> 34:12.980
Well, you bring a bottle like how many people want me to bring vodka the answers. Yes to all of you I

34:13.780 --> 34:18.460
Rarely get asked a question that I'm so enthusiastic about answering yes to because the smartest man in the world

34:19.140 --> 34:20.820
podcast is known more

34:20.820 --> 34:27.500
Colloquially as a vodcast because you know it's fueled by vodka if I'm not mistaken. It is in fact fueled by vodka much as a Jets are fueled by

34:27.900 --> 34:29.900
whatever Jets are fueled by

34:30.700 --> 34:32.700
My show is fueled by vodka

34:32.700 --> 34:38.580
Or fueled if you wish to pronounce all the letters in a word. I don't think it's it's a jet fuel jet fuel

34:38.940 --> 34:40.940
Jet fuel of course. That's what Jets

34:41.540 --> 34:43.540
used to go from one place to another

34:44.260 --> 34:46.260
like rocket fuel for

34:47.380 --> 34:49.140
Rockets and whatnot

34:49.140 --> 34:51.140
Speaking of rocket fuel

34:53.260 --> 34:55.260
So all right

34:55.900 --> 34:59.340
I'm well. Thank you for asking Jeff. Good to see you. So

35:00.780 --> 35:06.220
You you have a podcast called smartest man in the world. You're you're more erudite than I am you're you're a learned man

35:06.220 --> 35:09.740
You're a smart man. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're coming out with a book

35:10.900 --> 35:15.140
The smartest book in the world. Yes, you're a smart person. It's all a joke by the way

35:15.140 --> 35:20.780
Everyone's so serious right now. Great. They heard the word area died and everyone fucking panicked and shit

35:21.500 --> 35:24.460
If this was a radio, they'd be hitting seek really hard right now

35:25.140 --> 35:28.500
Great, what's your book about about 300 pages? Thank you for asking

35:29.700 --> 35:31.700
Jeff Davis ladies and gentlemen

35:33.100 --> 35:36.700
Yeah, oh, no, it's the bounce pass all the way out. I don't even look behind me

35:36.700 --> 35:39.740
You know what I mean? Because I know what's coming. Have either of you guys

35:39.740 --> 35:46.820
post 30 like like like well into the era of

35:47.900 --> 35:49.900
Everyone's got a phone in their camera

35:49.900 --> 35:55.060
Like like don't don't think about when you were 17 or anything. I have either of you

35:55.980 --> 35:57.980
Since the advent of the phone camera

35:58.660 --> 36:00.660
Taken a shit so big

36:01.100 --> 36:04.260
That even though you knew you were never gonna show it to anybody

36:04.260 --> 36:09.540
It was so big that you took a picture of your own shit

36:10.060 --> 36:12.740
Just because you were about to flesh it and

36:13.900 --> 36:16.620
You knew I mean, I can't stress enough like I

36:17.940 --> 36:20.540
Suppose you've guessed by now this happened to me recently. I

36:22.020 --> 36:25.380
Will never show it to anybody because it's gross

36:26.700 --> 36:30.620
But you know what I would never want to look at a picture of anyone else's shit

36:30.620 --> 36:33.140
You know there's websites where people post like pictures of shit and stuff

36:33.140 --> 36:35.140
But but

36:36.020 --> 36:41.860
Like I wasn't aware of that. I'm often looking at the rainbow bright website. So I'm a little prissy

36:42.300 --> 36:46.340
Either of you guys ever you never you never I've never been moved to actually reach for the phone

36:46.340 --> 36:51.940
There've been times when I've astound astonished myself, but I didn't I didn't know that it needed to be recorded

36:52.500 --> 36:56.860
Well, it's yeah, and don't make don't mistake me for saying like oh any time you take a big shit

36:56.860 --> 37:00.420
You should always I don't I never I'm saying like that's the that's the thing about it

37:00.420 --> 37:04.940
It is like I as my picture snapped. I was like this is I'm not gonna show this picture to anybody

37:04.940 --> 37:11.220
I'm taking this picture because that's how big the shit is and I'm 42 and I take huge shits all the time

37:11.780 --> 37:15.460
All the time and then I thought and I thought I have to see I have to do

37:15.460 --> 37:18.580
I'm not gonna share the picture with anybody the pictures for me, but

37:19.260 --> 37:22.340
Also, I just want to tell people I took a the biggest shit of my life

37:22.980 --> 37:24.980
42 I took the biggest shit

37:25.100 --> 37:26.620
Thanks guys

37:26.620 --> 37:30.860
But like so Greg you were in Paris recently, right?

37:30.860 --> 37:32.540
Last year

37:32.540 --> 37:34.540
No, I've never been tempted

37:34.860 --> 37:39.580
But I can understand the impulse. I just for me. It's like I'm in airports all the time

37:39.580 --> 37:42.500
And there's always guys on the commode as it were

37:43.540 --> 37:49.860
Having long conversations with their loved ones while they're doing the thing and to me that's I gross gross

37:50.380 --> 37:53.540
There's a time and a place for everything and a conversation doesn't take place while you're

37:53.540 --> 37:59.740
Eliminating I've never wanted to take a picture of my wand and I've never wanted to take a picture of any excrement

38:00.140 --> 38:07.340
But that's me. I'm a sissy. I mean you're you're a bold Viking who fucking forges forward and breaks through post-racial

38:07.820 --> 38:09.820
barriers and

38:09.980 --> 38:15.380
People from Jamba Juice on stage and gives them money so I can understand why you're you're a

38:15.500 --> 38:20.180
Limitory system might be a matter of some pride. Yeah, I didn't I didn't feel brave

38:20.180 --> 38:26.940
I felt cowardly as I was taking a picture like I felt like the the the the chimpanzees in the beginning of 2001

38:28.500 --> 38:34.460
I'm scared of this giant thing black thing that came out of yeah, if those things had cameras

38:34.460 --> 38:41.180
They would have those ostrich lipid the scene. They would have snapped a pic of the monolith. All right. Anyways took a huge shit

38:41.180 --> 38:42.180
I mean it was a hockey stick

38:42.180 --> 38:48.340
Okay, but was it in the shape if it had been in the shape of a monolith then I might consider it if it had come out as

38:48.340 --> 38:53.860
A perfect rectangle. I might think that's this is just you know what this isn't history anymore. This is science

38:55.060 --> 39:03.020
Yeah, we're gonna kneel to grass Tyson territory here and that the odds of taking a rectangular shit or one and one billion and yet

39:03.020 --> 39:07.900
Dan Harmon achieved it four times last week after visiting the fat burger on Centum on

39:10.100 --> 39:14.540
Yeah, I don't even know what I did and I didn't experience anything untoward on the toilet

39:14.540 --> 39:18.500
I was it was like it was like a normal experience sailing. I was just sitting there thinking about

39:19.580 --> 39:21.580
Xanadu or whatever and I

39:21.580 --> 39:24.380
And I just I just got off and I looked down and it was like this

39:25.500 --> 39:29.420
Remarkable amazing. Okay, we don't have to we don't have to talk about it. It's a conversation that goes nowhere

39:29.420 --> 39:32.340
I only wanted to talk about the relationship

39:32.340 --> 39:38.180
Did you ever see the South Park episode with the guy where the dad takes the giant shit that they do a whole episode?

39:38.180 --> 39:41.620
I mean that's like it is there is something about I

39:41.620 --> 39:46.060
I it's it's it's a it's an exploration of a thing that's always going on that of course

39:46.060 --> 39:51.140
No one wants you don't want to talk to other people about your shit. Some people still tell each other about their dreams

39:51.140 --> 39:53.140
I'm you know who you are

39:54.420 --> 40:00.540
Like like even that's not so great. So of course talking about your shit like in the minutia like it's like oh gross

40:00.540 --> 40:03.380
I don't like that when people go like oh, it was like a pebble

40:03.380 --> 40:06.820
But it had a stick on the end and I'm like, I don't care. I don't want picture your shit

40:06.820 --> 40:12.580
But but at the same time, I think there's something interesting about the fact that you know we we we we

40:13.180 --> 40:16.820
You know we do we do we do so few things every day

40:16.820 --> 40:22.020
And there's so few of those things that we do every day that we that we never really really talk about

40:22.020 --> 40:26.380
And then we really have a relationship with and it was it was it was the biggest shit of my life

40:26.380 --> 40:32.580
It was a foot. I've only been married once and I've only taken this big a shit once. I haven't had a baby yet

40:33.140 --> 40:36.260
But I mean it seemed like I did when I alright

40:36.260 --> 40:41.260
So alright, that's it. That's it. It was a special shit and I didn't call 9-1-1 or anything

40:41.260 --> 40:45.860
No, I took a picture and I just I just went upstairs. Hey, Greg. Thanks for coming. Greg Proops everybody

40:49.260 --> 40:51.740
To the H into the a into the alright

40:52.860 --> 40:58.500
All right. Well, okay, so that's the that's the gross segment of the show. I had another thing about I always

40:59.820 --> 41:04.900
Wondered about you know when you the recycle bin if you blow your nose and then

41:04.900 --> 41:09.780
You right is it still recycling is it garbage now? Well, yeah, are you supposed to put it in there?

41:09.780 --> 41:13.540
And I always picture like like a shoebox made out of recycled materials

41:13.540 --> 41:19.460
It was like are my my boogers somehow a part of the box right is like the last part of the coleslaw in the cardboard thing

41:19.460 --> 41:24.340
Still recycling or is it garbage because it's got the organic man. Yeah, you recycle tissues

41:24.820 --> 41:28.540
Well, you're supposed to he takes pictures of his shit Jeff. There's really

41:29.540 --> 41:33.180
There's really unlimited possibilities as to what he recycles at this point

41:33.180 --> 41:39.700
You're supposed to throw out your discarded paper products like like like but like well blow your nose and throw that in the recycle bin

41:39.700 --> 41:44.700
Well, I mean, it's not like being I mean that well, this is a question. I mean, I don't know

41:44.700 --> 41:49.060
I always hover over the two things because I'm like, well answer it. I'll go garbage

41:49.060 --> 41:53.620
I'm not because people have to pick through the recycling and they certainly don't want to feel your

41:54.660 --> 41:58.180
excretions there's a human being there's like a jawa that goes through every

41:58.180 --> 42:01.780
They don't just put it like a puddle

42:02.660 --> 42:04.820
to black people up here your

42:05.500 --> 42:07.500
understanding of what the underclass has to do is

42:08.180 --> 42:13.340
Rather limited. I would think in this regard Dan. Yes, people have to go through every manner of

42:14.620 --> 42:17.420
Think I think the recycling bin gets dumped out

42:17.420 --> 42:23.380
Well, take me through from the blue bin goes into the truck and then they take that one to Austrian men

42:23.380 --> 42:28.620
One's named Franz the other. I don't know his name. Take it to an area outside of Pomona, California

42:28.620 --> 42:32.780
where it's dumped into a giant refuse pile much like the volcano in Mordor and

42:33.660 --> 42:41.620
on the on the sides of this it's much like that that movie from several years ago the one with all the Indian children that won the Oscar for

42:42.700 --> 42:47.740
Slumdog millionaire, right? Yeah, slumdog millionaire where it made people feel awful and therefore good

42:47.740 --> 42:56.780
Because it was in color and there was dancing and why not so all the excreta effluvium erotic and

42:57.260 --> 42:59.260
Jetsum that the world

42:59.300 --> 43:03.300
Perpetrates someone has to go through each piece of it to see if there's any value to it

43:03.300 --> 43:09.500
And then they either put it in a bag and take it to a community where they sell it or it goes into a big giant furnace

43:09.500 --> 43:11.500
that's marked big devil and

43:11.700 --> 43:15.740
That's that's how recycling works, but you're talking about I mean we have a de facto

43:15.740 --> 43:23.360
Facto layer in there where the I have of course bullshitting at all times, but I would appreciate it if you'd maintain your respectful silence

43:24.380 --> 43:29.220
Because there's there are homeless people that go through and they go through the bins and then they go like oh

43:29.220 --> 43:32.620
They're there for the term indigenous street people, but yes

43:33.620 --> 43:36.940
And they grab the stuff homeless infers that everyone gets a home

43:36.940 --> 43:39.700
Which is I think our friend who works at Jamba Juice will attest

43:39.700 --> 43:46.140
When you're a wage slave no home is given to you the idea of home and homeless is a is a fairly

43:46.140 --> 43:49.220
I think George Carlin worked that point over pretty pedantically

43:50.660 --> 43:57.620
Don't you think I like I still honestly like all the shit that goes in the paper bin like I don't picture one human being going like

43:57.780 --> 44:01.740
This paper's got chocolate on it. It's a crew of people

44:02.380 --> 44:07.620
I don't know the the ruling on this, but you can't blow your nose and recycle that. That's just seems to thank you

44:07.620 --> 44:10.700
That's no, that's that's a no at the very least. It's impolite. Well

44:11.460 --> 44:16.500
Well, does that but that implied but then you have put your pizza your cardboard pizza box in there, right?

44:16.500 --> 44:20.300
It's got cheese on it. Yeah, but think about it. You don't you know you you don't

44:22.100 --> 44:26.740
You you put things that are recyclable and then like the things that that's like that recycle this plastic

44:26.740 --> 44:32.380
Recycler thing things a little symbol on it like things and ideally you clean them first you rinse them off and you put those in the recycle bin

44:32.380 --> 44:36.020
You don't just put anything that conceivably could be recycled in the recycle bin

44:36.020 --> 44:38.020
Well, you know

44:38.180 --> 44:41.580
I'm sure I'm not the person to be letting you in on this

44:41.580 --> 44:48.260
But we have gone recycle crazy to the point where there is often no actual refuse container in like offices and stuff

44:48.260 --> 44:53.260
There's like in my in the writer's bungalow at work. There is no non recycling

44:53.260 --> 44:59.020
There's like four giant cardboard boxes that all have the recycling someone like compost or something like that

44:59.020 --> 45:03.140
Because there's just four big giant fucking boxes that all have that symbol on it

45:03.140 --> 45:08.980
Is the I don't want to be a libertarian here, but it's the dirty little secret that the shit just goes into a fucking pile with everything else

45:08.980 --> 45:12.700
Is that like because the stuff that we're putting in these boxes?

45:12.700 --> 45:13.740
It's like, oh, yeah

45:13.740 --> 45:16.780
This is where the plastic and the paper and the cardboard

45:16.780 --> 45:18.780
It's to make people feel better about themselves, right?

45:19.300 --> 45:24.340
It's an exercise. It's a charade like a lot of stuff we do and my security at the airport and shit like that

45:24.340 --> 45:30.020
Most of our waste is like, oh, let's do this and then we'll pretend that it's really happening and why people are happy and everyone goes home

45:30.020 --> 45:33.860
And but you're saying there's still some guy picking through it. That's not just a guy

45:34.580 --> 45:38.820
Lately ever drive down the streets of LA and see people digging in the garbage cans and pulling out Burger King

45:38.820 --> 45:41.460
Roberts and shit like that. I guarantee you no matter what's happening

45:41.460 --> 45:46.180
I don't want to bring it down to a bummer level war all all your nice lower-middle-class fans are bummed out

45:46.180 --> 45:49.980
We're talking about we're talking about two different things though. You're talking about people like fuck

45:49.980 --> 45:53.460
I don't even have health care. I'm two paychecks away from going through a burger king fucking rapper

45:53.460 --> 45:58.540
You're talking about that's how they talk to themselves. That's it. Everyone's internal monologue in this room. It's kind of like this

45:58.540 --> 46:02.820
You're talking about I'm from Daytona. I don't know why everything's like this

46:02.820 --> 46:09.460
I understand that there's people that go through the garbage cans that then take stuff to the recycling center that the stuff that they

46:09.460 --> 46:14.340
I understand there's people that go through my garbage shutter that are like scavengers from sector seven

46:14.340 --> 46:17.900
I get that I admire those people. That's amazing that they're like

46:18.300 --> 46:25.180
Bothering to find the honest labor that quote-unquote honest labor that's afforded to their situation like it blows my mind

46:25.300 --> 46:27.740
Spencer only gives those people money. He doesn't give paying him. There's money

46:27.740 --> 46:32.340
He pulls over and randomly runs up to those people and gives them money because they're like he's

46:32.660 --> 46:36.020
Has some it's like yeah, you want to encourage the ones that are doing it

46:37.500 --> 46:38.700
Wow

46:38.700 --> 46:41.780
He labors under the false notion that this world is a meritocracy

46:43.060 --> 46:49.700
That can be enforced even at the lowest level, but I'm talking about at the place like I don't know where this stuff goes

46:49.700 --> 46:52.460
I know where there are people like I've watched like you know

46:52.460 --> 46:57.940
There's a modern marvels and things like that. What is it? There's a guy or a gal at a conveyor belt and they're looking for get this we need

46:57.940 --> 47:01.180
That that goes along the thing like they're actually there are right

47:01.700 --> 47:06.580
Sorters at the end. So they're just pulling. There's also a giant plastic island in the South Pacific that bobs up and down

47:06.580 --> 47:12.300
Yeah, yeah, a couple of kilometers wide and yeah, we should be able to start building on that pretty soon, right Dan

47:12.580 --> 47:18.620
I've talked about it on another show. I want to talk about it on this show. We need to do Harmontown from the garbage island

47:18.620 --> 47:22.100
It's out in the South Pacific. I don't know how we get there

47:22.100 --> 47:24.700
I think you fly and there's no birds or fish anymore

47:24.700 --> 47:27.260
But at a certain point in the South Pacific when you get out there

47:27.260 --> 47:31.500
There's a giant bunch of birds and fish because the garbage is there and you're like it's an ecosystem is right

47:31.500 --> 47:35.940
Yeah, there's all kinds of you probably can't walk on it though, right? It's not no sure you could it's nothing but six pack

47:36.740 --> 47:40.940
plastic things and containers and and styrofoam and whatnot and you're you know old tissues and

47:42.260 --> 47:47.940
Jamba juice cups that people threw away in LA that got caught in a tsunami tide and shot across the Pacific and stuff

47:47.940 --> 47:52.500
And I think it's gonna be solid enough in another six months or so that we can do a fucking benefit for it

47:52.660 --> 47:59.180
What what if that ends up being like of the the new world what if what if that is why he was three million years ago?

47:59.180 --> 48:04.940
Whatever Iceland now garbage island is the new paradigm and then we all it's like where all the intelligentsia live

48:04.940 --> 48:07.060
Oh, yeah, they form a perfect government, right?

48:07.060 --> 48:09.060
I'm gonna move there like

48:09.100 --> 48:13.180
Arthur Clark moved to Salon and I'm gonna write my next novel there and by that time

48:13.180 --> 48:18.180
There'll be mammals and monkeys and whatnot living on the garbage island as well and fauna and flora

48:18.580 --> 48:21.940
And there'll be palm trees growing out of nowhere and whatnot nature finds a way

48:24.020 --> 48:29.660
If we've learned nothing we've learned that Jeff Goldblum's absolutely right in the movie Jurassic Park

48:31.100 --> 48:34.980
Nature does find there's so many movies he's right in and independence day is one

48:34.980 --> 48:40.460
But the other one is Jurassic Park if you can get an Apple Mac to interface with an alien craft like he does in

48:40.460 --> 48:47.380
Independence day that is some feat of technology. Was he right in powder Greg and powder and powder was

48:48.380 --> 48:50.380
Jeff when is Jeff Goldblum wrong?

48:51.300 --> 48:55.500
He's right. He's right. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. I

48:56.820 --> 48:59.980
Hear I hear a grown man, but inside a frightened girl

49:00.900 --> 49:05.220
Wait, yeah, but they're right. He was wrong in the fly. He fucking he was

49:05.220 --> 49:11.060
But you know what he was right about he married Gina Davis while he made that movie. So he was right about that

49:11.060 --> 49:14.940
Well, okay, but the thing about the fly is it's a tragedy. It's like Macbeth

49:14.940 --> 49:21.500
So Macbeth was right about killing the king making him king. Well, he made a deal with the devil didn't he though?

49:21.500 --> 49:23.540
I mean, and that's there's the rubber, right

49:23.540 --> 49:29.460
But I'm saying that like yours that Goldblum is always at his best when he's right about something in a tragic movie like that

49:29.460 --> 49:33.460
A sci-fi horror movie that ends with him getting his sorry kids getting his brains blown out

49:33.460 --> 49:35.460
that the

49:35.980 --> 49:41.340
He's he's he's right the whole time. He's even he's even right even goes now. It's time to blow my brain right

49:41.340 --> 49:46.140
But he's he has a conscience in that one and all that jazz. He often does though. He's

49:46.420 --> 49:48.420
He's like a gold bloom

49:50.380 --> 49:53.880
You know what I mean, all right, so I

49:56.100 --> 49:58.780
Think that he's married now. So all the women in the room are safe

49:58.780 --> 50:04.780
For the moment if he was roaming around L.A. Yeah, he's he almost hurtled me like like oh, yeah

50:04.780 --> 50:10.060
He's my high or taller. Oh, no, he's quite tall. Yeah, and I was at a thing and I'm on a date with some girl

50:10.060 --> 50:14.340
Like it wasn't like a hot day. It was a girl. I knew we went to go see him play at the Argyle hotel

50:14.340 --> 50:16.820
Which is now called the the sunset whatever the fuck

50:16.820 --> 50:22.300
But we went and saw him and I was in the in the men's room and there was a men's room attendant

50:22.300 --> 50:27.420
And I saw I was washing my hands and there's Jeff Goldblum and the men's room attendant his sign says thank you

50:27.420 --> 50:32.620
My name is Jeff so I'm washing my hands next to Jeff Goldblum and there's a guy named Jeff and I said well

50:32.620 --> 50:35.340
My name is Jeff too. I said, you know meteor hits his bathroom

50:35.340 --> 50:39.020
That's that takes care a lot of the Jeff's building and and Goldblum looks at me goes

50:41.600 --> 50:43.600
Yeah, yeah

50:48.740 --> 50:50.980
So we walk outside and I'm with some gal and

50:50.980 --> 50:57.740
I choose good-looking kind of and and and he I introduced him to her because now we now we have we've had that moments

50:57.740 --> 51:05.260
And I introduce it. This is another Jeff and and he talks to this gal and never ever ever takes her eyes off of her

51:05.260 --> 51:05.740
tips

51:05.740 --> 51:12.380
Yeah, and and and then later like he he if he could have walked through me like with the at the atoms could have aligned

51:12.380 --> 51:15.500
We could have actually passed through me because that would have been faster

51:15.500 --> 51:20.660
Like quantum leap or something. Yes, we could have just completely

51:25.180 --> 51:30.780
It's now five minutes from now and I just walked through you you can get creepy to the point where you transcend

51:34.460 --> 51:35.980
If we took a

51:35.980 --> 51:37.980
Informal pole of every woman in this room

51:38.060 --> 51:41.180
He he's hit on every woman. I think on earth

51:41.180 --> 51:46.660
Yeah, for sure. There is there's a hundred and fifty people in this room. Maybe or am I flattering myself?

51:47.660 --> 51:49.660
Let's assume that

51:50.300 --> 51:53.740
That half of them are not women because it's Harmontown. It's like more like

51:54.540 --> 51:56.020
I

51:56.020 --> 51:59.260
You're right this time just beating your your observation dead the

52:00.140 --> 52:06.820
Number of women that I have talked to that have a Jeff Goldblum story that specifically about his sort of I don't want to use

52:06.820 --> 52:08.820
Hot-button language like predatory or anything

52:08.820 --> 52:11.780
He's not predatory that it's I've done a couple gigs with him

52:11.780 --> 52:18.100
I used to have him on my chat show a couple times and he was absolutely charming and and really lovable and fucking just like was

52:18.540 --> 52:21.060
Ceaseless. Yeah, but you know, you know that old saying

52:21.580 --> 52:27.460
When you're a teenager guy say to you if you hit on every girl like eventually one you can't you can't hit if you don't swing

52:27.460 --> 52:33.060
Right. He's the only person next to Bill Clinton who's actually observed that philosophy

52:33.540 --> 52:37.580
You know what I mean like most guys don't most guys don't hit on every single girl

52:37.580 --> 52:41.540
They need but Jeff Goldblum and Bill Clinton. I think you're like, hey, how's it going?

52:41.860 --> 52:46.620
And then every woman goes no and pushes them away and they're like fine. I'm on to the next but he also has a thing

52:46.620 --> 52:52.300
He has that really like animal like like sexual drive where when he sees a woman

52:52.300 --> 53:12.060
It's like laser beam lock like target lock. Oh, yeah, like the predator. Oh, see you. Yeah, you are one ugly bastard

53:14.540 --> 53:19.700
Blender of predator references there. It's a he the predator was hunting the person

53:19.700 --> 53:21.700
But then he was Arnold Schwarzenegger

53:21.700 --> 53:23.700
I changed

53:24.700 --> 53:26.700
My scenes have a lot of

53:28.580 --> 53:30.900
It's not complex as much as it is perplexed

53:30.900 --> 53:35.500
I also I got I got nearly I think you could call it a cross check a hip check

53:35.660 --> 53:40.420
I'm not sure what the correct hockey term is Bruce Willis went through me like he actually

53:40.740 --> 53:43.700
Dozed me over to get to it to get to a girl like wow

53:44.060 --> 53:46.060
And then I saw me he saw a girl

53:46.500 --> 53:50.540
And this is like my first girlfriend like that I was ever in love with and I was like early 20s

53:50.540 --> 53:56.220
And she looked enough like Demi Moore for me to get it like like like he she certainly was in his zone

53:56.220 --> 54:01.940
And he came out of the men's room at this club in Hollywood and saw her from across the way and there was various

54:02.580 --> 54:07.820
sofas and human beings and like like like Mario obstacles, you know

54:07.820 --> 54:12.340
Things for him to like like like pipes

54:15.740 --> 54:19.060
There was various Donkey Kong barrels rolling at him, but he had to get through

54:20.340 --> 54:26.900
And he saw her from across the room at about let's call it like you know, let's say 30 feet 40 feet and

54:27.420 --> 54:30.300
Looked and saw like Robocop saw the lay of the land

54:31.100 --> 54:33.100
like sofa

54:33.100 --> 54:37.840
1.5 meters high like like like charting a course she was four meters high

54:39.820 --> 54:46.140
The sofa was like the sofa's 1.4 meters and so he he looked around if it'll take so long to walk around

54:46.340 --> 54:50.740
Like like a human like a person would through the through affairs of traffic

54:50.740 --> 54:53.260
That a person might walk to get from one point to another in a bar

54:53.340 --> 54:57.300
He just started jumping over and climbing over accepting on people's coats

54:57.300 --> 55:03.380
Wow, just just just he was that desperate to get to her beeline and then he went kaboom right into me and I didn't like

55:03.380 --> 55:05.820
I kind of saw him coming. I I saw him coming

55:05.820 --> 55:08.860
I saw this all happening and I turned to my girlfriend and

55:09.340 --> 55:11.860
The next thing I know I see him and he's right on me and just goes

55:11.860 --> 55:18.340
It just knocks me like not all the way to the ground, but nearly Wow. Yeah, was this Hudson Hawk era or pulp fiction?

55:18.460 --> 55:22.820
It's after Hudson Hawk. Oh, he was like racing. He was like my hair's falling out. Yeah

55:22.820 --> 55:27.860
He didn't know how sexy he was gonna get when it finished falling out

55:27.860 --> 55:32.380
He was he was still airbrushing it out his head for 40 million dollars hard area

55:32.380 --> 55:36.380
That's what it is like three after pulp fiction. He's probably like hey come over here

55:41.780 --> 55:50.020
But Hudson Hawk guy is like vaulting like like bringing our two seagrams. All right, they don't even know they don't even remember

55:50.020 --> 55:54.360
I've had a few guys do it. It's pretty desperate. Yeah, I've had one or two

55:54.360 --> 55:59.900
I can't say their names. I got one or two guys just, you know, basically knock you down because there was something

55:59.900 --> 56:02.580
I've got run over by Nicholas Cage one time but

56:03.700 --> 56:05.700
In New Orleans, but he he came

56:06.180 --> 56:11.180
Absolutely careening out of an elevator in New Orleans and it wasn't because he was trying to get anywhere

56:11.180 --> 56:13.180
He just came out

56:13.180 --> 56:18.300
And I was and I was a guy waiting to get an elevator. Oh, sorry

56:22.460 --> 56:24.460
So many floors in this building

56:33.460 --> 56:37.500
I don't begrudge him for that but we all wanted what he was having that night because he likes

56:37.500 --> 56:45.220
Oh, that's so I love that. I've never yeah, I'd love to be near and my friend Tom Kenny told me that he was at Johnny Ramon's funeral and

56:46.180 --> 56:47.220
over at

56:47.220 --> 56:48.900
Hollywood Forever and

56:48.900 --> 56:54.980
Nicholas Cage was very good friends with Johnny Ramon and he goes he wore a matrix outfit a long black coat and shades

56:54.980 --> 56:57.900
And he goes everybody got up and spoke and then Nicholas Cage went

56:57.900 --> 57:06.580
Johnny, if you're up there, I know you can hear us

57:06.580 --> 57:07.580
Awesome

57:07.580 --> 57:13.060
I want Nicholas Cage in my funeral. Yes, you do. I don't even care if I can't see it. I want him to be there and go Greg

57:16.060 --> 57:18.340
Yes, rockin good news

57:18.340 --> 57:31.220
I don't even know him I want Nick Cage to do the eulogy so he can go Greg, you know

57:32.580 --> 57:37.100
He could probably charge for that the same way that they sell like the cryogenic

57:37.780 --> 57:41.060
Freezing companies like those are all scams. It's like, oh, who's gonna sue you?

57:41.060 --> 57:45.900
You know your head in a bucket, but so Nick Cage could make you he could yeah

57:45.900 --> 57:48.340
A million dollars old. I'll do your eulogy

57:51.700 --> 57:54.180
He has to work wait a second

57:56.260 --> 57:59.460
Dan I've known you for a long time. I didn't know you did a great Nicholas Cage

58:00.660 --> 58:03.140
Now it's all of a sudden it's like face-off and shit

58:04.220 --> 58:06.220
You're John Travolta in face-off

58:06.780 --> 58:12.540
I know I know I didn't I don't it's really good. It's just you know quite good. It's just it's it's

58:12.540 --> 58:20.020
It's you you do the Gary Busey over bite. Yeah, and then you raise it an octave. Yeah, so Gary Busey

58:20.620 --> 58:22.620
Nicholas Cage

58:23.180 --> 58:25.180
I think

58:25.620 --> 58:29.700
Like I kind of do it by like thinking because it's like like like like this is done. Not

58:30.300 --> 58:33.460
I'm done. Not but then this is Bill Clinton

58:34.260 --> 58:36.260
Bill Clinton

58:36.260 --> 58:42.260
I'm a little weapon

58:43.100 --> 58:48.740
I'm done nuts. I'm Bill Clinton. I'm done nuts

58:49.540 --> 58:51.540
I'm Bill Clinton. Yeah

58:52.100 --> 58:55.300
And then there's a third one that fits that same category. Who's it?

58:56.020 --> 58:59.260
Who's it? Who's it? Who's the third? Is it Jimmy Stewart?

58:59.700 --> 59:01.700
Well, Jimmy Stewart's more though. Oh

59:01.700 --> 59:06.380
Oh, Jimmy Stewart. I'm done nuts. I'm Bill Clinton

59:07.620 --> 59:12.540
But when he raised but Jimmy Stewart raises his voice he does the weird octave thing like in I was watching him

59:12.620 --> 59:17.140
What's the Christmas picture where it's a wonderful life? Yes, and

59:18.540 --> 59:21.260
Not as good as I remembered it frankly a little more

59:21.620 --> 59:23.620
Not a torped

59:23.660 --> 59:28.980
Sweaty it's a sweaty fucking Christmas movie everybody would rather live in Bedford Falls because it's way more fun

59:28.980 --> 59:35.820
Bedford Falls has bars that are open all night and and and like places to dance and people talk jive and stuff

59:35.820 --> 59:39.220
Yeah, right in the regular Bedford Falls everyone. Yeah, no, but in that one

59:39.220 --> 59:44.340
It's like well, it comes up pretty handy down here, but like you lose this shit and it goes right to the top

59:44.340 --> 59:45.780
Did I tell you?

59:45.780 --> 59:51.940
You weren't there Greg. I was with Drew. Did you get knocked over by Jimmy Stewart at a bar here in LA? No, so I'm I'm there

59:53.580 --> 59:55.580
I'm there with Katherine Hepburn

59:55.580 --> 01:00:02.940
Ginger Rogers was on the dance floor Jimmy Stewart comes out of the elevator, and I don't know what the fuck Jimmy Stewart's on

01:00:04.700 --> 01:00:06.700
I'm fucked to the test

01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:11.620
Who's that piece of ass over there

01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:18.820
I was it I was

01:00:19.540 --> 01:00:21.540
Remember when Drew Carey and I were dating

01:00:21.540 --> 01:00:24.980
Absolutely drew a single for a while he would call me up and said let's go to Vegas

01:00:24.980 --> 01:00:28.980
So we would go to Vegas and we want to go see John Fogarty from CCR of course

01:00:28.980 --> 01:00:33.500
Yes, and he played at the at the hard rock at the what was then the old joint

01:00:33.860 --> 01:00:39.140
And he had front row center seats to it and Drew is gambling out in the in the high stakes blackjack joint

01:00:39.140 --> 01:00:41.140
you know of course winning because he's rich and he can't lose and

01:00:42.180 --> 01:00:47.580
And Gary Busey is there and he's with a very lovely gal, and I don't know that it's a prostitute

01:00:47.580 --> 01:00:49.580
I just have my feelings about that

01:00:49.580 --> 01:00:51.580
She's my sponsor

01:00:53.420 --> 01:00:55.420
So we meet a bit and so I

01:00:55.620 --> 01:00:59.340
Drew's like a man that the show is starting so like I could finish out this hand

01:00:59.340 --> 01:01:02.340
I'm doing really well, so you want to go like there's an opening banner right now

01:01:02.340 --> 01:01:07.540
By the way, this is a dead accurate Drew Carey. Yeah, Jeff does the best you care. I can't do him as well

01:01:11.100 --> 01:01:15.220
I'll be there a bit so we get so we get there. I don't know what you guys go don't dance real funny

01:01:15.220 --> 01:01:20.780
I don't know what the seats are so I walk into the thing and it's it's it's because it's John Fogarty

01:01:20.780 --> 01:01:24.420
It's not people standing up. It's it's chairs. Yeah, it's silver ponytails. Yeah, exactly

01:01:25.340 --> 01:01:27.340
lots of silver ponytails and

01:01:27.700 --> 01:01:32.940
Yeah, and so I look for the thing and of course it's because it's drew it is the dead center seat

01:01:32.940 --> 01:01:36.940
Yeah, there are 15 seats right Muhammad Ali's in the corner. Yeah, exactly

01:01:37.100 --> 01:01:42.860
So we're there so I'm by myself and so I just sit down and there's there's eight seats flanking me empty

01:01:42.860 --> 01:01:47.900
So I looked like the weirdest guy in the world. I think oh wow this guy bought 12 seats for himself

01:01:49.140 --> 01:01:54.540
So I'm sitting there and finally drew comes and our friends all show up and I think you're at you're a homicide detective

01:01:55.220 --> 01:02:02.220
Who never solved the case of the guy who kept murdering women and playing a John Fogarty song over the phone every time he did it

01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:06.660
So he plays born on the bayou. I'm gonna scan this crowd pretty fucking hard tonight

01:02:07.300 --> 01:02:09.300
So it's a song that they did

01:02:09.300 --> 01:02:14.220
So fucking John Fogarty sounds amazing. He can't he still sounds like it's you know, yeah

01:02:14.220 --> 01:02:19.380
40 years ago. He's brilliant and he's laying it down and then drew comes in it all of our friends are there and

01:02:19.620 --> 01:02:21.700
I'm like, thank you for coming. It was very strange

01:02:21.700 --> 01:02:26.580
But I kind of like it was kind of fun to be like the weirdest like high roller guy that didn't buy the tickets

01:02:26.580 --> 01:02:28.100
You know drew carried it

01:02:28.100 --> 01:02:33.300
Then I keep getting flicked in the back of the head and it's bucey. He's he's he's row three and

01:02:33.940 --> 01:02:37.780
Everyone is seated because like it's people watching a show and it's not like, you know

01:02:37.780 --> 01:02:42.820
The nine-inch nails is not on stage. It's it's it's you know, he's like like put me in coach

01:02:42.820 --> 01:02:45.500
You know, I think no one's gonna be standing up today. So, uh

01:02:46.100 --> 01:02:49.260
We drew he keeps flicking me and drew in the back. Hey guys

01:02:50.620 --> 01:02:56.100
Hey, it's like it's a painful flicks on the back of the head like you're in junior high school and

01:02:56.740 --> 01:02:58.240
we're like

01:02:58.240 --> 01:03:02.420
Gary music he's flicking me in the head and and he's standing up. Yeah

01:03:02.420 --> 01:03:08.140
Yeah, the whole show and at one point Fogarty looks up and goes Gary. I see you sit down

01:03:12.820 --> 01:03:14.820
Wow

01:03:17.180 --> 01:03:19.820
So I can't imagine how many shows he's been to

01:03:21.660 --> 01:03:24.460
Come on man, like like this people are trying to enjoy this shit

01:03:24.460 --> 01:03:32.460
So imagine having success at that level where Gary Busey is your Adam Goldberg. Oh

01:03:37.780 --> 01:03:43.740
You have you have the regular crazy guy that comes to the show that sometimes you gotta go. Hey take it easy and it's Gary Busey

01:03:45.220 --> 01:03:48.100
That's fantastic, you know Gary Busey was in

01:03:48.900 --> 01:03:52.620
Leon Russell's band. He was the drummer for years and his name was Teddy Jack Eddy

01:03:52.620 --> 01:03:55.180
He went by Teddy Jack Eddy and when he did Buddy Holly

01:03:55.180 --> 01:04:01.740
He played and sang all the fucking songs in the movie with that with that band Gary Busey is a like a you know, not only is he

01:04:02.500 --> 01:04:04.500
You know amazingly

01:04:05.100 --> 01:04:06.860
incandescently weird

01:04:06.860 --> 01:04:11.980
To put it gently. He actually has a rock-and-roll background which makes it even more frightening. Yeah

01:04:11.980 --> 01:04:16.300
Well, okay, that's a perfect segue to let's bring out Spencer first of all

01:04:18.540 --> 01:04:20.540
Spencer Crittenden

01:04:20.540 --> 01:04:24.660
To the Spence to the sir to the Spence Spencer

01:04:26.660 --> 01:04:28.660
Hey, baby

01:04:32.220 --> 01:04:36.260
We're the kings of rock will take you higher does not really remind you

01:04:36.780 --> 01:04:44.700
Sucker MCs must call me sire. So I wanted to I wanted I wanted to address Randy Quaid a little bit

01:04:44.700 --> 01:04:49.820
Yeah, you're the only one I know that I actually like went through this video with. Oh boy. I

01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:58.300
I was at my friend's house the other day and I was like has anyone seen that Randy Quaid video and they didn't understand

01:04:58.900 --> 01:05:04.140
Like and so I was like no you have to see this and then no one put it on immediately

01:05:04.140 --> 01:05:08.860
So I was like no you have to see this and every 15 minutes

01:05:08.860 --> 01:05:12.140
I was like seriously you fucking guys you have to watch this video

01:05:12.140 --> 01:05:15.180
It's the most important thing in the world right now

01:05:15.180 --> 01:05:17.820
I'm aware of it because I saw it on the web today, but I didn't watch it

01:05:17.820 --> 01:05:21.100
Yeah, I did however watch a Dennis Quaid video where he was quite calm

01:05:22.980 --> 01:05:28.180
That's what I keep thinking about is Dennis Quaid just this waking up in the morning like like like the morning

01:05:28.180 --> 01:05:32.620
I get up because there's a call time. It's like 6 30 a.m. Schrab text me Randy Quaid

01:05:33.260 --> 01:05:38.100
He sent me a link to the YouTube video and and said he does he quotes

01:05:38.100 --> 01:05:42.900
Independence Day at the end of the video watch the whole thing because he goes I'm back

01:05:43.180 --> 01:05:49.860
Well, he's a thing which is a thing for I wanted to what the thing I was it sent me down this rabbit hole

01:05:49.860 --> 01:05:55.940
I'm like what what happened with Randy Quaid because he everyone just keeps brushing it into this pile and very very

01:05:56.340 --> 01:05:58.340
phobic about dismissing

01:05:59.100 --> 01:06:01.100
Crazy behavior. I don't I

01:06:01.580 --> 01:06:06.140
Guess it's I for obvious reasons like I don't want to be done like you know a couple

01:06:06.140 --> 01:06:12.620
Moves from that on that chessboard from if we're gonna start depending on where we draw the line

01:06:12.620 --> 01:06:14.620
I don't know how you play chess. Um, they

01:06:15.100 --> 01:06:17.100
Rook to Harmon for

01:06:17.500 --> 01:06:25.300
But into so like I always whenever whenever whenever somebody like has a meltdown in the press or like oh that crazy person that crazy person

01:06:25.300 --> 01:06:32.160
Whether it's the Coney 2012 guy or Charlie Sheen or Randy Quaid or me sometimes whatever the I always like go

01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:36.000
Like like well, what's the real story here? What's going on because the last thing?

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:40.360
I want to do is be a part of stuff of a gang of any kind

01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:47.800
If it's easy to say what a nut bar. I always I was compelled to let go. What does he do in this video?

01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:51.320
Oh, yeah, God. Well, you don't even you don't even you don't even know the headline of it

01:06:51.320 --> 01:06:56.400
I know I just saw that he made this and the wife's there, too. I presume. Yeah, the wife is there and she's in a bikini top

01:06:56.400 --> 01:07:00.040
She's hanging out in the background and then it's worse

01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:03.040
She's kind of glaring at the camera through aviator shades

01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:08.000
Well, he explains as he has before that Rupert Murdoch has it in for him and that he has never been

01:07:08.360 --> 01:07:10.860
that he's been fucked over by this like kind of

01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:17.320
Larger system which we can talk about in a second exactly what his what what his theory is and why he has it

01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:22.200
But he has this this this, you know, he feels he's been persecuted

01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:26.240
It's a I went down the rabbit hole of going through the timeline of everything that's happened to him started in

01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:31.640
2007 cut to I don't have time to explain all of it, but cut to he's got no US passport

01:07:31.640 --> 01:07:38.040
And he's basically sitting in one room in Canada waiting to get either I guess put in jail in Canada or sent

01:07:38.040 --> 01:07:42.720
I don't know where he doesn't have a US passport. They took a Hillary Clinton took his passport away

01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:44.720
I don't think personally

01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:51.440
Because you know John Kerry

01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:56.760
Called me the other week and he wanted to take my passport away, but I don't don't give it to him

01:07:57.200 --> 01:08:01.000
Exactly. It's a trick. I don't want to end up in Ontario in a fucking room with my wife

01:08:01.080 --> 01:08:06.400
So he's never worn a bikini top in a video that I can remember so he does or he does a small rant

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:10.640
Says like I hi, I'm Randy Quaid. I made

01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:16.360
20th Century Fox a billion dollars when I saved the world an independence day

01:08:16.360 --> 01:08:21.280
Um Rupert Murdoch is in return. What's happened?

01:08:21.280 --> 01:08:27.880
And he's just kind of recounts like he gets mad that Rupert Murdoch didn't thank him for saving the world an independence day at some point

01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:32.880
Yeah, I mean he kind of that's you're worried about calling him a nut bar. Yeah, I am

01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:38.040
I understand what I'm worried about is not fun to pile on. I'm worried about calling him a

01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:42.960
Drug addict because I think that everyone keeps going like oh crystal meth crystal meth crystal meth

01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:48.040
Let he who is without drugs cast the first, you know only users

01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:50.640
Only users lose drugs

01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:55.960
Let's all I feel like when I have a nervous breakdown you will part is that gonna happen tonight

01:08:55.960 --> 01:08:57.440
It may have happened Wednesday

01:08:57.440 --> 01:09:03.040
You don't know but part and parcel of my breakdown will be an increased use of whatever substances make no question

01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:06.280
No, and so I always wonder when people me it's Tang

01:09:06.280 --> 01:09:12.580
Have these like they have these brush-ups with the press in the contemporary society and it's like oh the

01:09:14.360 --> 01:09:17.280
Like is the drug the causal agent because he's not

01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:23.120
Everyone says he's the sweetest guy in the world. Yeah, he's been married to his wife. Evie for since the 90s

01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:26.360
They've always had a very passion. It's not a terrible actor. He's quite a good actor

01:09:26.360 --> 01:09:30.440
It's very fabulously talented and they a great character actor and they

01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:36.080
They hit and his marriage to you can't you can't Yoko the to to put it in Gen X

01:09:36.280 --> 01:09:41.160
Paralyzed that she's not she's not the cause of any problems either like they've had a they've had a passionate

01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:47.440
Partnership since the 90s. She didn't come in and and start causing problems in his life

01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:53.840
In 2007 shit just switched to like a light like stuff started going weird now

01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:56.160
Usually when you lose your mind

01:09:56.160 --> 01:10:03.360
statistically, you're in your your your early 20s some some people could but but if you're in a marriage and it's a

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:09.520
Biochemical thing you don't go crazy together. That's and there and he is not methed out

01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:15.600
He is not he he's not he does not he's chubby and and ruddy-faced and healthy looking

01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:21.160
He just seems to be really put out by what he claims is a is a global conspiracy

01:10:21.160 --> 01:10:27.840
He's having a manic episode or something that's it was been lasting for like six years. Yeah, but sometimes they do, you know

01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:31.440
That's what I that's that's what I look at Sinatra in the 50s or whatever, you know

01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:34.360
Like he made five million records or whatever, and I think you know

01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:36.800
I think he was up all night every night just like well

01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:40.680
That's the biggest crime of all then as if Sinatra was as if we're missing Randy Quinn

01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:42.680
I

01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:54.160
Would hate to think that we're missing Randy quits best years then because well, I don't think we're missing

01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:58.960
It's horrible when people pile on though and in turn send it from chasing Frankenstein to the village

01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:01.600
I don't know when the crime is being weird. It's like it's like well

01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:07.440
I think it's great when people gang up. I think the great thing about the internet is that we can gang up on bullies

01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:11.880
I think that's fucking great. Yeah, that's the best part. The weird thing is that we we just as though

01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:14.120
We seem to keep ganging up on nerds like we just

01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:20.280
Brian Williams and shut that like really dude, but won't Hollywood throw their arms around him like they did Robert Downey and like like

01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:23.280
I hope so. Let's make you famous again, or what's his name?

01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:25.120
the wrestler

01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:27.760
Mickey Rourke Mickey Rourke. Yeah, I hope so. I

01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:33.920
Mean he's he's he's he's aging really gracefully is a wonderful performers got this powerful voice. He's clearly off his rocker

01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:41.720
But I don't even I don't want to use that phrase necessarily because it's like like like I don't know like like he's an actor

01:11:41.720 --> 01:11:45.160
How sane is he supposed to be and exactly what the fuck happened?

01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:52.040
I don't know. I don't know. That's it. I feel like TMZ got him arrested six times is what happened to him

01:11:52.160 --> 01:11:56.560
That's enough to make anyone, you know a little upset. He's freaky. There's no question

01:11:56.560 --> 01:12:04.320
Spencer, but you know my argument always is like Dick Cheney walks the streets free every day and feels fucking empowered to give his opinion

01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:08.560
Anytime he likes Donald Trump fucking comes on TV and tells us he's going to run for president

01:12:08.560 --> 01:12:13.480
Sarah Palin gives speeches and shit like that and no one impunes their sanity at any point yet

01:12:13.480 --> 01:12:15.480
They're all evil fucking insane

01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:21.040
Unbelievable unbalanced maniac. Yeah destroyed the world in their own fine way

01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:29.760
If you took their money away by by by signing some form at City Hall that said that their jurisprudence wasn't the hall of bursars and the flim flim flam

01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:31.640
like

01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:38.040
Nothing looks crazier than being poor and having an opinion Donald Trump if he was fucking like he shuffled in here right now and had

01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:42.320
Like a rat tail on his cheek and said the shit that he says on Twitter

01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:48.120
I mean even just his

01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:54.160
On your head yeah, yeah, like like just being born rich just gives you like this sanity pass

01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:58.080
Oh, doesn't it just so I what I'm curious about is how they lost their money

01:12:58.080 --> 01:13:01.800
That's the I don't say that because all their trouble started like

01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:05.560
Hillary Clinton took away the passport and all of his gold

01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:14.800
Well, they're sitting up there in Canada and they're making videos you could you can follow every every every quade on Twitter

01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:19.240
She has like a hundred and forty eight followers, and I saw like a hundred and forty eight

01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:24.240
Yeah, they have like they have like these videos. There's like other videos that they're making from the same room

01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:29.760
How can you only have that many of this is that big of a thing? That's what I don't understand. I don't know why doesn't she have

01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:33.360
I don't I don't I don't it's it's one of those weird

01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:38.920
That's why I'm fascinated with their story because it's kind of doesn't doesn't doesn't fall into every little Apple box on my

01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:41.680
understanding of the world factory

01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:47.240
But then you work in a bungalow where there's a proprietary

01:13:48.440 --> 01:13:50.120
Exponential fucking

01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:52.880
You know, what did you call it a recycle bin?

01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:57.480
Cycling bin there's there's and yet, you know for a fact that those are hypocritical recycling well there

01:13:57.480 --> 01:14:02.760
I know because there is no actual there's not a box that says it just put shit and turds and boogers in here

01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:07.360
They're dead raccoons. There's there's like is there a lot of dead raccoons in the bungalow

01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:10.240
There's got to be one underneath it

01:14:10.240 --> 01:14:12.520
Oh, no, that was my last script

01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:21.520
There's nothing like a small mammal joke to really rocker

01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:24.760
The foxes must have got too late

01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:29.840
That's why act three was so unsatisfying I

01:14:33.560 --> 01:14:35.560
Think a ferret got to that

01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:39.680
Um, there's a yeah, there's just four giant boxes and there's a guy that comes at midnight

01:14:39.680 --> 01:14:43.640
And I sleep at my office enough to know that all he does is show up

01:14:44.040 --> 01:14:46.040
Like like sometimes he doesn't know I'm there

01:14:46.040 --> 01:14:52.640
So I get to listen to what he does from midnight to 4 30 a.m. And it's a real like risky business situation out there like he's

01:14:57.920 --> 01:15:04.720
Except he just keeps emptying the same garbage over and over and I keep thinking he's gonna come in my office

01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:09.760
And he has a key if he wants to he can but so I just sit there with my blanket go like it's like the it's like the

01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:12.400
the Baba Duke or whatever

01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:17.640
And then I just hear him out there just emptying stuff and then if I clear my throat

01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:21.480
He'll like be gone in 10 minutes because I think he just comes to my bungalow to fuck around

01:15:21.960 --> 01:15:27.560
But he also maybe thinks that someone's watching him so he pretends to take out the garbage for four hours

01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:31.720
Alright, so anyways is is my better half here

01:15:31.720 --> 01:15:35.880
Yeah, we should get we should get scooting on the shadow run as soon as we can yeah, is Erin McGathy in the house

01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:39.280
Erin McGathy

01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:51.760
Oh, let's run some shadows

01:15:58.360 --> 01:16:01.280
Johnny Ramon's funeral will commence in five minutes

01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:05.960
I may have ruined one of your keyboards

01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:10.680
What the max headroom is going on

01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:18.040
Aaron's in a very good costume. I can we dress up for our things that maybe I'll come

01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:23.040
That's like that's like when max asked if he could rap

01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:31.600
Yeah, I can't ask you to dress up, but please go ahead my I'm a 20 year old elf female shaman

01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:33.600
I mean I'll do it. Oh

01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:35.600
His hands are tied folks

01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:42.760
I forgot it at home, but I made you an earring clip on your end. Yeah a single year. I love it

01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:47.520
Yeah, I was late because I I have to finish a cake that I'm making for a film

01:16:50.120 --> 01:16:53.000
That's sad now that is it cake boss the movie

01:16:55.440 --> 01:16:58.040
Yeah, hamburger for this time. It's a bakery

01:16:58.040 --> 01:17:04.360
Um, and I realized that the eye of my my actual cake wasn't cool

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:10.760
So it made this this outfit. Oh, you don't like your cake. You think your cake's bad

01:17:11.720 --> 01:17:16.840
No, no, the cake is fine. It just it just has to cool for me to properly. Oh, I said it wasn't cool

01:17:16.840 --> 01:17:19.960
Oh, no, and then I just lost my mind and I'm like

01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:26.160
The glue gun I'm dressing up. This isn't enough. I blew it on the cake

01:17:27.720 --> 01:17:31.000
Do we have to moorage here as well? Yes, let's bring up to more Demars brown

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
Hey tomorrow

01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:42.160
Or bill as I know you

01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:47.480
I love you so I always will I'm just the bill the way people say oh when I kiss my wife

01:17:47.480 --> 01:17:52.320
Which is a totally normal thing for every human makes me feel very inhuman doesn't it?

01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:55.200
I talk about my wife a lot on my show and people go

01:17:55.200 --> 01:17:58.520
I can't believe how proud you are of your wife and it's like, what are you with your wife?

01:17:58.960 --> 01:18:02.360
You keep her in a room like fucking Jane air or something I

01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:10.520
Took an Uber over here and the Uber driver and I watched the feed on the way over so it was so strange coming into the

01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:13.240
Oh, good plug, sweetie. Yeah, well

01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:18.060
It was great, I was whisked away and

01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:22.760
Anyway, I was watching I was watching the feed in an Uber driver turned back behind he said you're

01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:28.080
From that house. There's another man. I take him to Burbank, and I'm like, yes. Yes. Oh you had our talk

01:18:32.160 --> 01:18:34.160
That's not stubborn arts

01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:37.480
Or did you have one of the 37 armands?

01:18:37.480 --> 01:18:44.800
And he said he's a he's an assistant to a cook and I just stopped the feet

01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:46.880
I was like what where he's not an assistant to a cookie?

01:18:46.880 --> 01:18:49.120
I take him to Burbank, and there's a big picture there

01:18:50.120 --> 01:18:54.720
Cooking picture and he's he's an assistant to a cook and I said no no. He's a writer and he said for a cook

01:18:56.560 --> 01:19:04.440
Are you a writer for a cook? What do you write like I'm a polygamist, and this is how we find out I

01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:11.520
Wasn't watching the feed tonight. I was watching I don't know if you saw but Jonathan E from the Houston team is playing a worldwide

01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:17.160
Rollerball match tonight, so I was watching that on the way over. Yes, that's a rollerball reference everybody Wow

01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:19.320
At the logo for my

01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:25.560
The logo for star burns is a cook is a chef. That's what he's talking about. It's kind of amazing that

01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:28.560
I don't know

01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:36.800
Cooking school it's like it's like it's like when Harvey Barks at Danny DeVito. I'm like wow. He thinks it's a dog

01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:45.480
Oh dossiers

01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:52.680
My dog thinks that Danny DeVito or we don't know we don't we can never know why our dog Barks at Danny DeVito

01:19:52.680 --> 01:19:54.680
if you if you if

01:19:54.680 --> 01:19:59.120
When the eye if you put on a ladder season of always sunny

01:19:59.400 --> 01:20:03.880
The dog goes nuts like there's a cat on the screen or something if you

01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:06.640
That's for you

01:20:07.320 --> 01:20:14.580
If I'm in my mind the dog will also in the iTunes screen if if if the if the

01:20:14.840 --> 01:20:22.640
The Rainmaker with Danny DeVito and Matt Damon both of whom are on the poster is in the upper left corner of the screen

01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:29.480
Because it's in your most recently viewed section. The Harvey will look up at the upper left corner of the screen and go

01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:36.600
Because it's smaller Danny DeVito and more well groomed

01:20:36.760 --> 01:20:39.580
But then you put in season six of always sunny and he goes

01:20:43.200 --> 01:20:46.840
And and only does that for dogs cats and Danny DeVito

01:20:46.840 --> 01:20:54.960
Because they're all the same weight, but if you put in like like like junior or something like that like like like

01:20:55.520 --> 01:20:59.520
It has to be like a disheveled Danny DeVito like how he has to get furry

01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:03.200
I mean war the roses is out or

01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:07.140
What I well, I don't know we haven't put it where I'd like like

01:21:07.800 --> 01:21:09.800
One floor over the cuckoo's nest when he's quite young

01:21:10.720 --> 01:21:12.720
Haven't tried it. I mean haven't gone through the whole

01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:18.720
Martin, I'm just amazed the fucking dog like it barks at the drawings of cats and I said I said I said to Aaron like

01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:22.360
Try drawing a picture of a dog on a piece of paper with a sharpie

01:21:22.360 --> 01:21:27.560
Let's see if this fucking dog is like goddamn Caesar in Planet of the Dogs and

01:21:29.480 --> 01:21:32.880
And so Aaron goes like oh, yeah good idea and she drives this thing

01:21:33.120 --> 01:21:36.240
Aaron's an artist I guess she does it like the dog

01:21:36.280 --> 01:21:39.720
She drives a cartoon dog the dog's head is the size of the dog's body

01:21:39.720 --> 01:21:44.180
Like she's drawing like like a pictogram of a dog like I like that I I'm like no

01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:52.220
Sorry draw draw like a regular picture the dog baked a dog. I wonder what it's like being married to Greg Proops

01:21:54.400 --> 01:21:59.720
She drew the most amazing drawing of a dog is what Greg what's that my wife's a very good artist

01:21:59.720 --> 01:22:02.280
She did the pictures for my book. So then I go so

01:22:02.280 --> 01:22:09.840
It's good plug sweetie. She did actually so I go draw a regular picture like draw just like a silhouette of a dog

01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:14.640
Just draw like a like a kind of a realistic shape of a dog and she goes. Okay. Okay. I think I got yeah

01:22:14.640 --> 01:22:21.120
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, and she draws for a while and then she turns it around and it's a picture of me with a dick in my mouth

01:22:26.040 --> 01:22:28.040
Dan

01:22:28.040 --> 01:22:33.280
Max you can buy that drawing if you want later on after the show

01:22:33.880 --> 01:22:40.320
Is it a picture or a photograph really? I mean it was inspired by very real things in our heads Spencer

01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:43.600
Let's let's let's let's get this rolling horn from the pages of reality

01:22:44.600 --> 01:22:47.920
Now Greg are you are you hip Greg to what's going on in our shadow?

01:22:47.920 --> 01:22:52.760
I'm so hip to the jive Dan and I had an extensive conversation where let's move on

01:22:52.760 --> 01:22:58.760
All right Spencer, do you want to what do you need from us? Do you want to get you want to get rolling here?

01:22:58.760 --> 01:23:04.600
Do any preamble you have a groovy theme song and shit? I don't know. I do have music for us. Well, there you go

01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:10.960
I don't I didn't write anything down for the intro part. So I don't know maybe just I could do it

01:23:10.960 --> 01:23:13.880
All right, well put up the music and Dan'll do it then

01:23:16.760 --> 01:23:19.240
Last time on shadow run

01:23:19.240 --> 01:23:24.160
This is a damn Jamba juice get your ass out here

01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:27.800
We don't got no hamburger

01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:36.400
Go down to pinks

01:23:41.720 --> 01:23:45.080
Jim nightblade and his shadow run crew

01:23:45.080 --> 01:23:48.560
Were assigned to find a

01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:53.320
Btl chip designer named Baldwin Brown

01:23:54.960 --> 01:23:56.960
In a compound

01:23:57.200 --> 01:23:59.200
surrounded by

01:23:59.360 --> 01:24:02.600
Btl aka better than life chips

01:24:03.400 --> 01:24:05.720
That they were also supposed to get a hold of

01:24:07.120 --> 01:24:10.160
Infiltrating the compound with his fingertip nano whip

01:24:10.160 --> 01:24:16.640
Jim nightblade made quick work of the perimeter scaling the roof of the nearest warehouse

01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:22.360
Again nano whipping a nearby vent the other characters did fine

01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:32.120
Sliding down silently like a deadly spider

01:24:32.120 --> 01:24:40.000
Jim nightblade came down in the middle of the warehouse with his grappling gun and his faithful

01:24:41.040 --> 01:24:43.040
sexually tense compatriot

01:24:43.760 --> 01:24:45.760
Eve Liberty Eve Liberty

01:24:47.720 --> 01:24:49.720
Helping her down onto the floor

01:24:54.240 --> 01:24:55.640
Nightblade

01:24:55.640 --> 01:24:59.800
Then asked her to send a stun bolt to the two guys playing poker

01:24:59.800 --> 01:25:03.000
And then they get they didn't it didn't work all the way and they shot some people

01:25:04.400 --> 01:25:06.400
horde a guard the German guy is

01:25:07.120 --> 01:25:09.960
Keeping watch from beyond using his psychic powers

01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:16.200
Eve Liberty meanwhile is out front. That's mercy. Okay mercy. Sorry mercy. God damn it

01:25:17.320 --> 01:25:21.280
Mercy that's my wife's character is out at the south gate

01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:24.200
occupying three armed guards

01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:26.920
with various

01:25:26.920 --> 01:25:31.320
Dirk Benedict a circa 18 shenanigans

01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:38.560
When we left them nightblade and Eve were

01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:43.800
Closing the distance between themselves and the backs of the meaty heads of the three

01:25:44.880 --> 01:25:47.200
Security guards that we were about to shoot him

01:25:47.920 --> 01:25:49.920
Okay, yep

01:25:49.920 --> 01:25:56.240
You know, it's amazing is that you did that

01:25:57.400 --> 01:26:02.800
46 seconds, which is almost exactly what the old length of Spencer's intro was you felt that I thought you were gonna say

01:26:02.800 --> 01:26:05.920
I thought you were gonna look at that and then go 46 minutes

01:26:07.960 --> 01:26:12.840
The show was over five usually the master of brevity, but you really wrapped that fuck her up

01:26:14.400 --> 01:26:17.960
Yeah, so it was because he was missing some certain information

01:26:17.960 --> 01:26:23.240
About horde guards and what she did maybe we should hear the intro from horde guards perspective

01:26:23.840 --> 01:26:25.840
Is this like our Rashomon?

01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:31.040
Perhaps not the whole intro, but for example, I am not German. I'm Norwegian

01:26:32.800 --> 01:26:34.800
Same difference during the war, bro

01:26:36.200 --> 01:26:38.200
Nice Wow

01:26:38.840 --> 01:26:41.400
Too soon war burn

01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:46.000
Apparently what a chop

01:26:47.240 --> 01:26:48.840
All right

01:26:48.840 --> 01:26:54.000
So just some housekeeping up top. It's actually a mono whip not a nano whip

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.640
It's actually quite a bit thicker than a nano whip

01:26:58.640 --> 01:27:06.360
We're talking about dicks, right?

01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:16.560
Okay, so it's just like it's a mercy space

01:27:17.320 --> 01:27:21.240
It's actually quite a bit thicker than a nano. I just looked at Greg Greg. What I

01:27:21.240 --> 01:27:31.840
Think it was either did I leave the oven on or yeah, all right, so the three guards are being occupied by mercy right now

01:27:31.840 --> 01:27:35.560
Right Spencer. Yeah, and and horde guard you are

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:40.120
You got you got a line of fire on one of those guards to the front side

01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:42.920
from the front outside the gate of the warehouse compound and

01:27:44.680 --> 01:27:48.600
Jim nightbladed and I Eve were sneaking up from behind right now, correct?

01:27:48.600 --> 01:27:54.200
Well, you were on the roof of the building. Okay. Well, I just send down to get with Jim nightblade. All right, that happens

01:27:54.640 --> 01:27:56.920
Hey nightblade, I'll catch you back

01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:01.440
Sorry, I'm getting

01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:09.480
What's the range between Jim nightblade and I with the with the guards? Well, he's still on the roof

01:28:09.480 --> 01:28:15.040
You're about 120 feet off. Oh, he's not done like it. I didn't hear him go down there night play get down here

01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:17.040
I

01:28:17.640 --> 01:28:19.640
I'm down there

01:28:20.560 --> 01:28:24.160
What's your agility plus sneaking Dan fuck

01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:30.280
I'm so sorry probably four plus something in parentheses

01:28:34.640 --> 01:28:40.120
I was I think it was nine total last time right? Well, that was me shooting dudes. I remember that

01:28:40.120 --> 01:28:45.480
Yeah, agility plus sneaking I had a tougher time with five plus

01:28:46.560 --> 01:28:48.320
Looking at my sneaking

01:28:48.320 --> 01:28:50.000
four plus four

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:56.680
That's that's 13 none. Yeah. Yeah. All right. You sneak down quietly

01:28:58.160 --> 01:29:04.320
And what we're how far away from these guards 120 feet. All right Mercy keep keep keep them looking at you

01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:06.320
We're sneaking up behind them. We're gonna get a shot on these guys

01:29:06.760 --> 01:29:08.760
all right

01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:12.120
Can you see through my head? No, I

01:29:13.400 --> 01:29:18.340
That was me in character as mercy. I don't think they would say it like that. Thank you

01:29:19.960 --> 01:29:26.920
All right, let me let me try that again. I look I look at them and I'm acting kind of crazy to distract them

01:29:27.960 --> 01:29:33.200
Hey, sometimes I feel like I'm no one can see me at all and it feels like you guys can really see me

01:29:33.200 --> 01:29:39.760
Can you see me or see through me? No, I use my fucking diplomacy. Is that just gone?

01:29:39.760 --> 01:29:41.920
Do it might I would do I no longer have any

01:29:42.720 --> 01:29:44.720
charisma what

01:29:45.080 --> 01:29:49.400
Do I have charisma you're asking them a question they're answering I don't I don't get what's happening

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:56.560
Okay, sorry Spencer the way you said it. Well, they just it's a question. You're asking right? Well, it's a flirtatious

01:29:57.840 --> 01:29:59.840
Why are you flirting with Spencer?

01:29:59.840 --> 01:30:08.880
All right, well, they're still looking at me even though they said no, right? Yeah, okay, they can't see through your head

01:30:11.240 --> 01:30:13.240
All right

01:30:13.840 --> 01:30:17.840
I'm good. I'm going to regroup and approach differently from now on

01:30:18.520 --> 01:30:20.960
So they're gonna look at me. I'm good. I'm not gonna walk away

01:30:21.480 --> 01:30:23.000
Jim nightblade

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.560
I'm gonna cast improved invisibility on myself

01:30:25.560 --> 01:30:32.200
I become invisible to human beings and to sensors and cameras and things like that walk up and just I have shot

01:30:32.200 --> 01:30:35.400
Gloves where my gloves are electric and I'm just gonna go zap and knock these guys out

01:30:35.400 --> 01:30:38.320
But you got a well. No, there's only two guys. There's three of them, right?

01:30:38.560 --> 01:30:41.120
Three I've got the third one cupboard. Okay

01:30:42.160 --> 01:30:45.440
Do you like this plan or do you want to come with yeah? I'm gonna go from my left

01:30:45.840 --> 01:30:49.040
So third one will be all the way on my right

01:30:49.040 --> 01:30:58.120
Or I could just cast it I could just cast a stun ball on all these guys and just knock them all out. I

01:30:58.400 --> 01:31:03.560
Yeah, the the the more stunned they are but when I get it within shooting range

01:31:04.240 --> 01:31:06.960
The more alive they'll be tomorrow for their families

01:31:12.200 --> 01:31:14.720
This is Aaron asking when we when we

01:31:14.720 --> 01:31:22.000
When we ended last time I had said to that group that they should stay and I was going to walk away

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:27.480
And we ended on a cliffhanger. Am I still I felt like we were about to pull the triggers and shoot these guys

01:31:27.480 --> 01:31:32.180
Let's just shoot these fuckers. Let's just take them out. Yeah, I have walked away, but they're standing

01:31:32.180 --> 01:31:34.840
I totally vote for shooting if that's what we're doing

01:31:35.840 --> 01:31:38.600
All right, I look I've got my my stick and shock

01:31:41.360 --> 01:31:43.360
Bullets in my gun and I put it on

01:31:43.360 --> 01:31:52.040
Like like three-shot pulse mode. So how far away are you? I start closing that we start closing the gap

01:31:52.040 --> 01:31:57.000
Maybe you want to sneak up a bit? Yeah, I'm walking toward these guys until I can shoot them in the head. Okay

01:31:57.640 --> 01:32:00.280
We're walking toward them until what's a good range to shoot that from?

01:32:01.760 --> 01:32:05.040
On your pistols. Yeah, probably about 20 20 meters

01:32:05.920 --> 01:32:09.720
Okay, we close that we close that distance you do that quietly

01:32:09.720 --> 01:32:12.520
All is well, okay

01:32:13.200 --> 01:32:16.600
Guys, let's just with the rifle. I have it aimed

01:32:17.640 --> 01:32:19.640
200 armor-piercing grounds. I'm using

01:32:20.680 --> 01:32:26.240
Four of those okay, I'm waiting for the third one horde guard pick a guy. What's what's your guy look like still standing?

01:32:26.480 --> 01:32:30.040
That's the one. I'm going to shoot. You're gonna get it. We'll shoot first one will still be standing

01:32:30.040 --> 01:32:36.000
That's the one. I'm going to take right. Okay. Okay, so I'm a hundred yards away from the guys at this point

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:41.060
I can sell. Okay. I will not shoot Jim. Which one do you want? I'm starting from the left. Okay. I'll get the rights

01:32:42.080 --> 01:32:44.460
Okay, ready and proofs is with horde guard

01:32:46.160 --> 01:32:49.820
Suddenly I chucked three teargrass grenades

01:32:58.120 --> 01:33:02.320
Who is this guy they call me apocrates

01:33:02.320 --> 01:33:04.320
You

01:33:05.040 --> 01:33:10.040
Tossed three tear gas grenades. That's right. I heal people because I took an oath

01:33:10.040 --> 01:33:13.360
I heal people for the for the highest bidder

01:33:14.240 --> 01:33:20.740
They they bounce along the floor and one of them bounces into the gatehouse of the guarding the gate and they all

01:33:21.080 --> 01:33:28.920
Trigger going off Lee unleashing acrid smoke into the air the guards start coughing and and wheezing and then freaking out

01:33:28.920 --> 01:33:33.840
And then you hear you hear a siren like a fire alarm going she's going on right

01:33:35.320 --> 01:33:37.320
shit

01:33:40.280 --> 01:33:46.640
Do we know this guy who's who's who's going grenades he's in your team he was there all along. Okay. All right

01:33:48.040 --> 01:33:52.340
Is there somebody that I can see yeah, you guys are together. I'm a troll

01:33:52.340 --> 01:34:00.540
But I swore to heal people I have a gas mask. I put it on all right good call

01:34:00.540 --> 01:34:04.820
Are these guys are these guys immobilized or what are they doing? They're coughing

01:34:04.820 --> 01:34:10.020
It's it's very you guys have opportunity to go right when you're seeing these things happen

01:34:10.020 --> 01:34:14.020
Okay, let's take a shot. Take the shot. Oh go take the shot. I shoot as many people as I can I

01:34:16.300 --> 01:34:19.660
Pop pop pop I pick off my guy. All right. What are your pistols?

01:34:19.660 --> 01:34:22.340
Do Jeff I know Dan's pistols. There's six

01:34:23.260 --> 01:34:27.200
Six all together four plus two six. Oh plus what plus your agility

01:34:27.860 --> 01:34:29.860
Plus ten ten

01:34:30.180 --> 01:34:34.680
Mine's a total of nine. I remember. All right, you hit him directly in the chest

01:34:35.100 --> 01:34:41.140
It goes it pierces straight through their armor for for Dan and knocks the guy on his floor

01:34:41.140 --> 01:34:44.280
He's bleeding out the the other guy gets hit with three of your

01:34:44.280 --> 01:34:51.940
Stick-in-shock rounds and you see some electrical activity as he goes down to the floor convulsing. There's one left

01:34:52.760 --> 01:34:56.480
Quarter guard take the shot. I take the shot with my rifle

01:34:57.280 --> 01:35:00.080
All right, what's your agility plus the automatics?

01:35:01.920 --> 01:35:03.920
Eight all right

01:35:04.560 --> 01:35:07.440
All right, you also hit him his head explodes

01:35:07.440 --> 01:35:17.000
I shot as a pre-cog. I knew this would happen. This is why I took those actions. You sure you're not German

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
The alarm's still going off

01:35:22.280 --> 01:35:24.280
Hey face face Eve

01:35:25.080 --> 01:35:28.680
Mercy you got a keyboard tape to your stomach

01:35:29.320 --> 01:35:31.320
Can you do something about that alarm?

01:35:33.240 --> 01:35:35.640
I can I can try I

01:35:35.640 --> 01:35:42.680
Am I'm still wearing my my my business wear. Yep. I I run inside. I

01:35:43.480 --> 01:35:45.620
Try to locate the alarm box

01:35:45.960 --> 01:35:50.040
All right, you head inside the gatehouse and it's a pretty simple construction

01:35:50.040 --> 01:35:56.080
You think there you see a switch that's activated that looks to be the alarm. That's probably it. Hello my darling

01:35:58.920 --> 01:36:02.720
I walk up to the alarm and I

01:36:02.720 --> 01:36:04.560
I

01:36:04.560 --> 01:36:08.680
Using my my attribute my attribute of composure. Mm-hmm. I

01:36:10.320 --> 01:36:15.880
I'm calm and I try to make sense of the alarm. I try to flip off the alarm using your composure

01:36:15.880 --> 01:36:20.440
You flip off the alarm the silence rains and also

01:36:21.120 --> 01:36:23.120
tear gas

01:36:24.600 --> 01:36:26.960
Sorry about the mess, but it's quiet

01:36:28.160 --> 01:36:30.160
to quiet

01:36:30.160 --> 01:36:36.440
We still have that one guard inside that I only stunned you do it's nightblade you blew a dude's head off in there

01:36:36.840 --> 01:36:40.440
We have with that one guy still down Spencer. Do we know how long that's done lasts on them?

01:36:40.840 --> 01:36:44.280
You know an hour or two a few hours. Okay, so he's good. Probably

01:36:45.280 --> 01:36:52.080
Can I still get a room back in there? That's probably where the target is and we gotta we gotta check all these crates for those chips

01:36:52.080 --> 01:36:56.480
You hear the sound of sliding metal as the loading bay door closes shut

01:36:57.200 --> 01:36:59.040
behind you

01:36:59.040 --> 01:37:00.480
probably

01:37:00.480 --> 01:37:02.480
Depending on your orientation

01:37:06.960 --> 01:37:11.360
And the loading the loading dock door is the only door into the warehouse well

01:37:11.920 --> 01:37:16.160
You guys came in through the ceiling right, but is there another door that we found or no?

01:37:17.240 --> 01:37:22.400
Not one that I'm aware of all right, so again, I'm sure that's the only door

01:37:22.400 --> 01:37:30.800
I'll go down the chimney and then I run up and yeah grapple grapple up to the

01:37:31.400 --> 01:37:35.200
Grapple up to their warehouse roof. All right, you do that. I

01:37:36.320 --> 01:37:40.360
Asteroidly perceive I go into a shamanic trance and I asteroidly project myself

01:37:41.280 --> 01:37:47.560
And I project myself inside the warehouse to go into the room where those machines were and see or just to check check out the whole space

01:37:47.560 --> 01:37:54.160
All right, you see about six bodies inside surrounded by machines and our security devices

01:37:55.040 --> 01:38:00.600
Six bodies in the main room in the in the room that you haven't entered yet. Okay guys and

01:38:01.680 --> 01:38:06.840
I do I detect any any magic any spirits in there or just just regular human being just humans all right guys

01:38:06.840 --> 01:38:08.840
It's that we got six bodies inside that room

01:38:08.840 --> 01:38:20.160
Well, it's a little outside my jurisdiction Six bodies are they dead?

01:38:20.720 --> 01:38:22.240
No, they're living

01:38:22.240 --> 01:38:25.160
Can I use my ability to detect enemies?

01:38:25.800 --> 01:38:28.680
Yeah, range. No you detect enemies

01:38:29.600 --> 01:38:31.600
You detect enemies

01:38:32.440 --> 01:38:34.440
There's there's five plus

01:38:34.440 --> 01:38:40.720
In the building so that means that everyone in that room neither one of them is the person. We're seeking

01:38:42.240 --> 01:38:48.160
I mean, it's not really been established whether the person you see you're seeking as an ally or an enemy

01:38:48.160 --> 01:38:53.520
So nobody's in the in the outside of the warehouse. They're all inside that room correct. All right guys

01:38:53.520 --> 01:38:57.080
I'm gonna go in there. Let's all go in together. Let's let's have each other's back here

01:38:57.080 --> 01:38:58.960
I'm gonna go in there before we do this

01:38:58.960 --> 01:39:05.160
Should I perhaps take this opportunity to take my rifle to the stunned one than maybe shoot him? Yeah, I'll do that

01:39:05.160 --> 01:39:09.040
Well, you'd have to get in the building first. So how do you want to do that?

01:39:09.960 --> 01:39:11.960
Let's see. I have a grappling gun

01:39:14.040 --> 01:39:18.760
Why don't we just why don't we just just monofilaments that uh that that door open man?

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:24.240
Yeah, we'll be long gone by the time I wake up Spencer. How does my stealth tag work?

01:39:24.240 --> 01:39:29.560
Um, that's like an RFID tag. It's like a tracking bug basically so you could stick it on stuff

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:34.880
All right, another time. Is there time to let a cigarette while all this bullshit's going on?

01:39:37.160 --> 01:39:39.960
Nightblade monofilament that door open. Let's go in there

01:39:39.960 --> 01:39:45.440
What I'll do is all I I can summon a spirit that goes in there and just knocks it like knocks them out with noxious gas or something like that

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
Winky doodle do

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:53.480
It's not not a permanent I'm workshop and catchphrases

01:39:56.360 --> 01:39:59.480
Spencer am I am I in a space with one of those guards?

01:40:00.600 --> 01:40:02.800
You're in the gatehouse. There's

01:40:04.040 --> 01:40:06.280
There's a dead guard in it. Yeah, okay

01:40:06.280 --> 01:40:11.480
I take the dead guards clothes and I put on his clothes and I'm gonna use my skill of disguise to

01:40:11.480 --> 01:40:18.000
Kind of emulate his body language. All right. What's your? Yeah, what?

01:40:18.320 --> 01:40:20.320
What's your intuition plus disguise?

01:40:21.560 --> 01:40:25.480
My intuition is four and my disguise is three

01:40:27.160 --> 01:40:29.640
Seven all right you don't have to disguise

01:40:33.320 --> 01:40:37.600
All right, and I start walking towards the room all right meanwhile

01:40:37.600 --> 01:40:42.360
Jim nightblade attempts to monofilament whip the door open

01:40:44.480 --> 01:40:51.440
But your robot finger careens off the surface of the door directing your monofilament whip directly right at you

01:40:51.440 --> 01:40:54.280
No, it slashes you. What's your armor?

01:40:58.480 --> 01:41:00.480
Top right corner top right

01:41:00.480 --> 01:41:07.440
Is it AP or what I'll say armors my old eyes. It's

01:41:08.320 --> 01:41:13.440
Armors, I'm looking for the word armors and it's core combat info up top right

01:41:13.480 --> 01:41:20.880
It's just the number to the topist rightist. Oh, well, it's yeah rating. It says nine. Yeah, okay. Oh, right

01:41:22.680 --> 01:41:27.560
Okay, so you cut yourself open right in the torso you're bleeding pretty heavily

01:41:27.560 --> 01:41:32.920
Thank goodness. I'm here. It's sliced through your armor like butter

01:41:34.040 --> 01:41:36.040
Let me fix that right up

01:41:36.560 --> 01:41:38.560
The door stands unopened

01:41:40.120 --> 01:41:42.120
Let me try that again

01:41:44.240 --> 01:41:51.520
Are you sure now you're all cut open but do I let me let me put some first aid on you a critical failure

01:41:51.520 --> 01:41:55.120
Do I feel like that's what happens when I try to use my mono whip?

01:41:55.120 --> 01:41:59.860
Uh, you feel like that's what happens when you critical failure with your mono whip. Okay?

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:07.000
Yeah, hold on just I'm gonna try again. Sorry. Don't be so tough. God damn it. Let me stitch you up and try it again

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:12.760
You're in a different you're not in the building with me. I'm here alone bleeding to death

01:42:12.760 --> 01:42:16.240

Yeah, I wanted to grapple up to the ceiling come down through the the great that I came through earlier

01:42:48.080 --> 01:42:50.080
Okay, and then what door were you cutting I?

01:42:50.720 --> 01:42:55.600
Thought that I had done that so I thought I was cutting the loading dock door so that they could come in okay

01:42:55.600 --> 01:42:59.520
Well, then you're inside and you failed to cut the loading door. So yeah, okay, that's true

My golden hooves have heard that there is trouble in this land

01:48:43.760 --> 01:48:45.760

Specific he got about a sexual preference at the end

01:49:45.840 --> 01:49:47.840
We didn't even bring it up

01:49:48.840 --> 01:49:51.520
At least he wasn't a black guy you brought up to rap

01:49:53.920 --> 01:49:57.080
The guy was good one of them was

01:49:57.080 --> 01:50:03.760
Is it is the door open? Oh, yeah, it's been kicked in by a unicorn

01:50:05.920 --> 01:50:11.960
Spirit will you inhale that noxious gas so we can go in there and enter safely? Oh, the spirit's gone. He did his business now

01:50:11.960 --> 01:50:13.960
He's done. I'll say

01:50:14.680 --> 01:50:16.680
All right

01:50:16.680 --> 01:50:18.760
All right, is it safe for us to walk in there?

01:50:19.280 --> 01:50:24.240
It might be a bit. I still have my gas mask on I walk in there and then examine what's going on

01:50:24.240 --> 01:50:29.440
Bag him and tag him look for the ball guy. You see four four young teenage

01:50:29.680 --> 01:50:32.720
Druggies they're kind of just sprawled out on the floor. They got

01:50:33.360 --> 01:50:35.800
Microchips stuffed into their head skulls

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000
Get those chips gather them up

01:50:40.080 --> 01:50:41.440
Good call

01:50:41.440 --> 01:50:46.160
As you gather up the chips the people come to and they're like hey man giving that back

01:50:46.160 --> 01:50:53.960
Am I am I there? Yeah, you guys are all at the door. He's the only one inside the room, but yeah, okay?

01:51:01.160 --> 01:51:03.160
Just ride that high

All right, we're gonna we're gonna take away the bad ones

There's some bad stuff that came down the shoot here, and I'm just trying to help you out

01:51:11.560 --> 01:51:19.380
And also I'll stun baton them like right in case in case they don't I think I think they're okay

01:51:19.380 --> 01:51:23.560
I think they're just druggies that were high on BTL chips, and they're just coming out of the stupor right now, right?

01:51:23.560 --> 01:51:25.560
Yeah, but we need to control the environment

01:51:26.720 --> 01:51:31.080
Wait, I look around I only see four druggies in the ground. I look for the other two people

01:51:31.080 --> 01:51:35.360
I saw I saw six bodies in there who the other two. What's your perception plus?

01:51:36.520 --> 01:51:38.520
intuition

01:51:38.520 --> 01:51:40.520

01:51:40.560 --> 01:51:42.560
It is eight eight

01:51:43.840 --> 01:51:51.640
Alright using your keen eyesight you see an empty table and behind the empty table a thin almost

01:51:52.360 --> 01:51:55.440
imperceptible seam in the wall a secret door a

01:51:55.440 --> 01:52:05.480
Threshold worthy of probably am I right? Yep cliffhanger

01:52:08.560 --> 01:52:11.840
That's like Greg Proops for coming down again great groups
