00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
Oh yeah. This musical theme is created by Jordy White from Marilyn Manson's fame.

00:10.000 --> 00:17.000
Who is joining us next week at Fred Sablon because a new show on Feral audio, Hour of Goon, is also airing.

00:17.000 --> 00:24.000
So Jordy's made us a lot of music, so get ready for a lot of groovy, spooky rock from Jordy White.

00:24.000 --> 00:32.000
I think there's lyrics at some point too. Let's bring our special critter in everybody.

00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
The Mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
Thank you very much.

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
Yeah, did you explain that?

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
I did. I shot it at that.

01:04.000 --> 01:08.000
Alright. I was getting all ready to explain the Marilyn Manson guy.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
Yeah.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
Now how am I going to start the show?

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
Take a swing at it.

01:13.000 --> 01:19.000
This guy from Marilyn Manson made music.

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
He's going to be on the show in a couple of weeks.

01:22.000 --> 01:26.000
That guy likes Star Wars and comic books more than anybody in this room.

01:26.000 --> 01:30.000
He is the biggest sci-fi geek in the universe. It's great.

01:30.000 --> 01:37.000
I got Star Wars on my Apple TV. I watched Hateful Eight instead.

01:37.000 --> 01:44.000
I can't believe. I'm kind of proud and ashamed of it at the same time.

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
Every time I open up the thing, I'm like, I'm going to watch a movie and then I see the other new Star Wars.

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
I'm like, I'll just watch it some other time.

01:51.000 --> 01:57.000
It's not a clip of Han Solo wanting to use the crossbow.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
And then he's like, I like it.

02:00.000 --> 02:04.000
I can extrapolate what that movie is going to be.

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
It's not for me, right? It's not for me.

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
Yeah, I think I mentioned that I fell asleep in a theater, then fell asleep in my dream.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
We're old, you know?

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
We're old.

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
Is it for young people? Spencer, did you watch it?

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
Did you dig the new one?

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
I never got into Star Wars, man.

02:22.000 --> 02:27.000
I saw it like a couple of times as a kid, but then any time I'd seen any part of it since then,

02:27.000 --> 02:32.000
I was like, what the fuck? Is this Darth Vader? He's in this one too?

02:32.000 --> 02:36.000
It's just really crazy to me. So it's just the same thing.

02:36.000 --> 02:40.000
I'm excited about the fact that what they're doing industrially speaking,

02:40.000 --> 02:45.000
I think they might as well break that thing open and do what they're doing in a post-Marvel world.

02:45.000 --> 02:49.000
Let's watch a million Star Wars movies. I don't mind that.

02:49.000 --> 02:53.000
Because they're taking, you know, they're just throwing everything at the wall.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
And so some of that shit's going to be good.

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
All different writers and directors and stuff. It's going to be fun.

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
It's not a secret, right? The Legos guys are doing the Han Solo thing.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
That's all announced and stuff.

03:05.000 --> 03:10.000
And Adam Driver's playing Han Solo? Am I getting any of this right or am I just old?

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
I don't know. I could have this all wrong.

03:13.000 --> 03:18.000
They're like, no, Adam Driver is playing. Never mind.

03:18.000 --> 03:24.000
Adam Arkin is driving them to the lot.

03:24.000 --> 03:30.000
Yeah, I'm getting ready to, you know, I'm just banking stuff for, you know,

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
I'm just trying to put together a nest egg for my retirement now.

03:33.000 --> 03:37.000
And I don't need to take in any more pop culture. I'm not going to be relevant.

03:37.000 --> 03:41.000
Ten years from now when this stuff's going to be funny to reference, you know,

03:41.000 --> 03:47.000
like when I was 35, you'd bust out a Goonies joke and people would be like,

03:47.000 --> 03:56.000
so the equivalent of that right now for this stuff, I'd be like 70 going like, remember the remake of the remake of the remake of the Goonies?

03:56.000 --> 04:01.000
And people would be like, go to bed, old man.

04:01.000 --> 04:06.000
Do you have an ideal retirement age? Do you think you want to retire at some point?

04:06.000 --> 04:11.000
42. I am currently a year behind schedule.

04:11.000 --> 04:18.000
I spent the day retired. I didn't have to shoot. I was supposed to be writing my book for a double day,

04:18.000 --> 04:25.000
but instead I've really, I really was a bad boy today.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
Like a girlfriend's out of town.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
And so it was literally like, you heard my voice last week.

04:31.000 --> 04:36.000
Like I've been, I've not been outside of anyone's company for like months.

04:36.000 --> 04:43.000
And like, I just sort of, I just vegged out today and I kept opening up my computer and going,

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
okay, I'm going to start writing.

04:45.000 --> 04:56.000
But then like, I took like bullshit time wasting video gaming to a new level today

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
and just actually made some interesting discoveries.

04:58.000 --> 05:06.000
Like I've been playing this game called Avengers Academy on the iPad.

05:06.000 --> 05:16.000
It's like a game for and by 13 year old girls set in the Marvel universe in which all the Marvel characters are going to prep school.

05:16.000 --> 05:21.000
And you press on WASP and she says like, want to take a selfie?

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
And then she takes a selfie for a while.

05:24.000 --> 05:29.000
And then like, you can make her take selfies faster if you buy enough crystals or,

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
but like, you know, you're not going to pay any money, right?

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
You're going to beat the game.

05:33.000 --> 05:41.000
And so I've been on this thing for a while and now they've got the Guardians of the Galaxy event happening this weekend or all through April.

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
So there's like, you can unlock Guardians of the Galaxy.

05:44.000 --> 05:49.000
They crashed outside the campus and you're just, it's just a farming game.

05:49.000 --> 05:57.000
It's getting really scary how much of a science they've gotten like our just dopamine spiking to things.

05:57.000 --> 06:03.000
So you can see the effect it has had on me.

06:03.000 --> 06:07.000
I'm not as put together as I usually am.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
But there was a game I found.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
It's called Adventure Capitalist.

06:11.000 --> 06:16.000
It's by this, the company's called Congregate with a K.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
I'm actually, I'm recommending, you should check it out.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
Like, I don't, I'm not going to say everybody in the world's going to like it,

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
but it's insane.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
It's insanely like minimalist.

06:25.000 --> 06:34.000
Like, it literally is like, you press a button to make your lemonade stand generate money.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
So it's a progress indicator that goes whoop.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
And then your lemonade stand has made money.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
So then you press it again.

06:41.000 --> 06:46.000
And it whoop, it did it again, whoop, and you keep doing it, and after a while if you keep doing it,

06:46.000 --> 06:52.000
a button appears below it that says, well now you can buy a donut shop.

06:52.000 --> 06:56.000
More money, progress indicator goes a little slow.

06:56.000 --> 07:00.000
After a while you get some more money and then it goes, hey, you tired of pressing those buttons?

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
Why don't you hire a manager?

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
And you go to the thing.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
And you hire these managers.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
A lemonade manager, thousand bucks.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
And your lemonade is like, whoop, whoop, whoop, your lemonade is getting made.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
And you orgasm when that happens.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
They trick you.

07:15.000 --> 07:20.000
You're going like, oh my God, it's making lemonade whether I touch it or not.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
And then you do the same with the donuts.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
And it goes all the way, there's two rows on the iPad.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
If it's portrait style, it's two rows.

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
And the bottom row is just oil rigs and everything.

07:30.000 --> 07:38.000
And I've been playing it for two days straight because part of the game is once you get like into quadrillions of dollars,

07:38.000 --> 07:45.000
you can start, you can restart, you accrue these angel investors.

07:45.000 --> 07:55.000
Which means basically, all it means is that you can start the game over and you kind of like, it's like, everything costs different.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
But it's, say, I'm so fucking addicted to it.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
They've figured it out.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
Like, you don't need a Pac-Man eating dots even.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
We're monkeys.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
We'll just sit there and fucking.

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
Like, I've got the thing running right now.

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
I can't wait to get home.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
Can we fire it up and see where you're at right now?

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
No, no, no.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
I will run.

08:16.000 --> 08:22.000
What I want to do with my phone is I brought, so Avengers Academy, back to that.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
So I'm playing Avengers Academy.

08:24.000 --> 08:30.000
And it's these kids, they're young adults and they've got will they won't they stories going on.

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
And it's all family oriented.

08:33.000 --> 08:46.000
But the Tony Stark character, of course, is supposed to be, he's supposed to be like the, you know, he's like the, for those of you who are my age, three of you, he's the Mahoney of this Academy.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
Nope.

08:47.000 --> 08:52.000
Nobody's, that was for me and you.

08:52.000 --> 08:56.000
Spencer's dad listening somewhere at home.

08:56.000 --> 09:04.000
Okay, but okay, so, so every time you touch these kids.

09:04.000 --> 09:09.000
All right, that was for me, you and a couple people.

09:09.000 --> 09:14.000
Now I'm listening.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
Go on.

09:15.000 --> 09:19.000
Every time you touch these kids, you get a dollar.

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
And they get a piece of candy.

09:22.000 --> 09:27.000
You touch enough kids, you get a van.

09:27.000 --> 09:37.000
But it has windows in it, but you can remove them as you upgrade.

09:37.000 --> 09:42.000
Your cross-space needs more space.

09:42.000 --> 09:48.000
You need a shovel sharpener.

09:48.000 --> 09:52.000
It's to bury the kids you killed.

09:52.000 --> 09:56.000
You sickos.

09:56.000 --> 10:02.000
Okay, but every time you touch one of these young folks, that made it better.

10:02.000 --> 10:09.000
Every time you tap on one of them, you know, they just every time, every time you tap that.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
They have a sound bite.

10:11.000 --> 10:18.000
Like I said, if you tap Wasp, she goes like, so fierce.

10:18.000 --> 10:22.000
They have like 20 random things, so sometimes she'll go like, whatever happened to romance.

10:22.000 --> 10:27.000
Let's see, I think I have, I wanted to set the tone for you, so let's see.

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
Here's a Wasp one.

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
Wait, oh shit, I gotta put it, okay.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
This party started.

10:36.000 --> 10:40.000
Let's get this party started, Wasp says.

10:40.000 --> 10:45.000
You know, it's just, in case you didn't know what a sound bite was.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
Can I hear a couple more?

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
Loki is going to the Academy too.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
He's kind of like, I know what you're saying, isn't he a bad guy?

10:51.000 --> 10:57.000
Well, that's the thing about you, when you're in school, it's like, front of me, you know?

10:57.000 --> 11:01.000
So like, so like Red Skull will come in a leather jacket and he'll be like, what's up?

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
You know, it'd be like, get out of here.

11:03.000 --> 11:10.000
And I'll be like, okay, so here's some Loki sound bites or one Loki sound bite.

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
I didn't take orders from you.

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
So that's just like, imagine these are just little bites.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
He's the Gecko?

11:18.000 --> 11:24.000
So over time, you're going to hear these things 5,000 times if you're really addicted to this game.

11:24.000 --> 11:28.000
And so the thing is about the Tony Stark character.

11:28.000 --> 11:38.000
Now, if the kid playing Tony Stark is a fan of the podcast, I hope he doesn't do anything untoward to himself.

11:38.000 --> 11:42.000
You sound fine. You should be working in voiceover work.

11:42.000 --> 11:48.000
It's just that your clips were poorly directed and poorly chosen for the game,

11:48.000 --> 11:53.000
because they're very, very long for considering that every time I tap on Tony Stark,

11:53.000 --> 11:57.000
which is going to be a lot because he's the best.

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
And he makes everything.

12:00.000 --> 12:06.000
So you have to hear these very long sound clips.

12:06.000 --> 12:15.000
So I recorded a handful of Tony Stark's sound bites until I got to the one that really, really bothers me.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
And I think it's the last one.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
So first, we'll just listen to a couple.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
I didn't take orders.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
Oh, that's not...

12:22.000 --> 12:27.000
Oh, could you imagine if that was Tony Stark?

12:27.000 --> 12:31.000
Why did you bring me to this podcast?

12:31.000 --> 12:35.000
No, I swear, Rob Corddry was here last week.

12:35.000 --> 12:39.000
He's my favorite writer.

12:39.000 --> 12:43.000
Someone's on a first date tonight.

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
And I blew it for them.

12:46.000 --> 12:51.000
But there's one other person who's on a first date and we're nailing it somehow.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
I don't know how.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
I don't know.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
Maybe the girl that brought the guy...

12:55.000 --> 13:00.000
The guy is like, maybe he's like a big Avengers fan.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
And he's like, I didn't know...

13:01.000 --> 13:06.000
I didn't know you'd take me to see a fat guy play clips from the thing.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
And she's like, yeah, well, I know what I'm doing.

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
And he's like, I'm going to make love to you tonight.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
And she's like...

13:13.000 --> 13:18.000
See how I reverse those roles to give the woman agency?

13:18.000 --> 13:26.000
I was going to go see David Gilmore from Pink Floyd, but I'm so much happier that we came to see this.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
Oh, the fat guy...

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
Yeah, it's okay.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
The fat guy playing clips.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
That's David Gilmore from Pink Floyd.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
No, he's a very sexy guy from Pink Floyd, isn't he?

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
God, is he here?

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
No, I think he's playing tonight at the Forum or something.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
Oh, okay.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
I was trying to figure out what dot you were connecting.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
I know.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
I'm just saying, you know...

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
Tonight's the dot.

13:44.000 --> 13:49.000
We live in the entertainment capital of the world, there's a lot of choices for your entertainment dollar.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
David Gilmore from Pink Floyd is playing.

13:51.000 --> 13:56.000
I mean, even I would say better to come here.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
Even you?

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
Yeah.

13:58.000 --> 14:04.000
Even if Roger Waters isn't there, come here.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
Wow.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
All right.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
Shots fired.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
All right.

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
So here's some Tony Stark.

14:12.000 --> 14:15.000
Let's get serious or not.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
Okay.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
He's funny.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
He's the funny one.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
So remember that one.

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
He's the funny one.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
Remember that one.

14:22.000 --> 14:25.000
Let's get serious or not.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
Okay.

14:26.000 --> 14:29.000
So that one's going to come back to haunt you in a second.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
Here's some more.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
We make a great team.

14:33.000 --> 14:36.000
I mean, I'm the boss, but still.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
Okay.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
Okay.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
All right.

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
Tony, let's do a couple more longer, longer.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.000
Longer.

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000
Remember kids are going to have to listen to this 500 times.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
Can I give you one more note?

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
We do it again.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
Can you trail off towards the end?

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
Yeah.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
Can that lose energy kind of?

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
Yeah.

14:53.000 --> 14:57.000
There's one that's not on here where he goes, you can tell that the kid like that's doing the voice.

14:57.000 --> 15:02.000
You can tell that the director was like, I think, I think we're missing the, can you do it one more time?

15:02.000 --> 15:08.000
I don't think we're getting the word assistant because, because the catchphrase, maybe you could be my new assistant.

15:08.000 --> 15:12.000
And it's really weird.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
All right.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
There's more.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
This has a payoff kind of.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
I'm a genius.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
Yeah.

15:19.000 --> 15:25.000
He just said, how does everyone feel about me making an army of robots?

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
Whatever.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
I mean, we feel great.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
Like do it.

15:28.000 --> 15:32.000
Like it's not a catchphrase.

15:32.000 --> 15:38.000
Do you think villains know that they don't have a chance or do they just not get it?

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
This is like nails on a chalkboard.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
I don't like it.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
Okay.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
I think this next one might be, let me, oh boy.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
Okay.

15:45.000 --> 15:48.000
I'm taking a half day.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
Yeah.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
That one's fine.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
That's short.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
Let's get serious.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
Okay.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
So here we go.

15:55.000 --> 15:59.000
So two of them, two of them start with let's get serious.

15:59.000 --> 16:04.000
So you remember the first one starts with a middle, down the third baseline, let's get

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
serious or not.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
You know, it's fine.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
Is he growing up?

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
Is he growing through puberty?

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
No, no.

16:11.000 --> 16:14.440
This one sounds like he's just clipping the mic and he's just enraged at first.

16:14.440 --> 16:19.120
But now, listen, don't react like after let's get serious.

16:19.120 --> 16:20.960
Listen to the tag on this one.

16:20.960 --> 16:25.920
So it's a different, like why they would include two let's get serious ones, I don't know.

16:25.920 --> 16:29.120
But this one is the worst.

16:29.120 --> 16:32.680
This is the worst, like it's not the worst Avenger Academy catchphrase.

16:32.680 --> 16:38.080
It's not the worst thing that, this is the worst thing ever.

16:38.080 --> 16:40.760
And every, there's like a, there's like a one in 20 chance.

16:40.760 --> 16:43.640
You hear this every time you tap on Tony Stark.

16:43.640 --> 16:44.640
Okay.

16:44.640 --> 16:47.600
So again, don't react after he says let's get serious.

16:47.600 --> 16:49.120
Wait for it.

16:49.120 --> 16:54.120
Wait for the amazing punchline.

16:54.120 --> 17:09.680
Let's get serious is what people tell me all the time.

17:09.680 --> 17:11.680
Is that a line from the movie?

17:11.680 --> 17:12.680
No.

17:12.680 --> 17:15.080
That's not a line from humanity.

17:15.080 --> 17:16.080
That's not.

17:16.080 --> 17:18.680
I have not seen the Iron Man films.

17:18.680 --> 17:23.120
Are people constantly saying you're too serious or you should be more serious?

17:23.120 --> 17:30.560
Like cool it is something people say to me, no one ever talks like that.

17:30.560 --> 17:31.560
That's awful.

17:31.560 --> 17:34.800
It's, and it's really long and it's like, it's just, it's terrible.

17:34.800 --> 17:39.280
And maybe it lost something in the translation, but it's all I could do to play this game

17:39.280 --> 17:40.680
for the last two weeks.

17:40.680 --> 17:42.960
So it's not enough to scare you off playing it.

17:42.960 --> 17:43.960
No, I'm addicted.

17:43.960 --> 17:45.360
I love WASP selfies.

17:45.360 --> 17:48.160
I love the, I, they're all there.

17:48.160 --> 17:49.880
I'm leveling them up there.

17:49.880 --> 17:54.640
You know, there's a, there's a little intrigue with director fury.

17:54.640 --> 18:00.560
You know, he's like, you know, a black widow is like, you know, mistrustful of the Avengers

18:00.560 --> 18:01.560
Academy.

18:01.560 --> 18:05.240
So she's like, there's a whole, there's little plots and things, but really it's just, it's

18:05.240 --> 18:06.840
just a farming game.

18:06.840 --> 18:07.840
All right.

18:07.840 --> 18:11.640
Well, so that's what I did today instead of writing a book.

18:11.640 --> 18:16.280
If you, if, if, if, if you had a book deal, you'd play video games, right?

18:16.280 --> 18:17.280
Dan?

18:17.280 --> 18:20.160
Like as well, you're playing video games, you're, you're not sitting there going, fuck,

18:20.160 --> 18:21.160
I want to kill myself.

18:21.160 --> 18:23.600
I wish I had a book deal.

18:23.600 --> 18:25.320
I trust me.

18:25.320 --> 18:27.880
I apparently, if you had a book deal, you'd play video games.

18:27.880 --> 18:28.880
Do you have a deadline?

18:28.880 --> 18:29.880
Like a...

18:29.880 --> 18:30.880
Yeah.

18:30.880 --> 18:31.880
Yeah, I do.

18:31.880 --> 18:32.880
Let's...

18:32.880 --> 18:33.880
Oh yeah.

18:33.880 --> 18:36.640
They're, they're, they're strict about that stuff in publishing.

18:36.640 --> 18:37.640
Yes.

18:37.640 --> 18:40.280
Hey, can you say how far off it is right now?

18:40.280 --> 18:43.280
It's spring-ish.

18:43.280 --> 18:46.640
Aren't we, aren't we currently in spring right now?

18:46.640 --> 18:47.640
Yeah.

18:47.640 --> 18:48.640
Yeah.

18:48.640 --> 18:49.640
Yeah.

18:49.640 --> 18:50.640
Spring 2016?

18:50.640 --> 18:52.640
Let's get down to work on this book!

18:52.640 --> 18:53.640
Or not.

18:53.640 --> 19:01.640
Is something my agent's been telling me.

19:01.640 --> 19:07.480
Wait, so you got a month or two left?

19:07.480 --> 19:08.480
Jeff, stop.

19:08.480 --> 19:09.480
I'm trying to...

19:09.480 --> 19:10.480
You're...

19:10.480 --> 19:13.800
It's just that we're, we're gonna come up with a name for this, like the, the blood

19:13.800 --> 19:15.040
thirst that Jeff gets.

19:15.040 --> 19:17.920
No, I'm not, this is not me trying to do a pecking party.

19:17.920 --> 19:23.040
I'm saying, like, how, how, I, I, I, this is honest curiosity, this is not me trying

19:23.040 --> 19:24.040
to...

19:24.040 --> 19:25.040
It's, it's due soon, dude.

19:25.040 --> 19:26.040
Okay.

19:26.040 --> 19:28.760
I, I, how, are you, are you, are you clipping along?

19:28.760 --> 19:29.760
Are you making...

19:29.760 --> 19:30.760
No!

19:30.760 --> 19:31.760
I'm not trying to...

19:31.760 --> 19:35.760
I wrote, I wrote a really good introduction.

19:35.760 --> 19:38.240
And I think I have a title and...

19:38.240 --> 19:39.920
Is it, is it autobiographical?

19:39.920 --> 19:40.920
Is it fiction?

19:40.920 --> 19:41.920
Is it...

19:41.920 --> 19:42.920
Young Adult Detective series?

19:42.920 --> 19:43.920
What do you got?

19:43.920 --> 19:47.200
Can you please write a Young Adult Detective series?

19:47.200 --> 19:50.960
That'd be so fucking awesome.

19:50.960 --> 19:54.320
Once this hits the New York Times bestseller list, I'll, I'll, people will come back to

19:54.320 --> 19:55.880
me and go, what book would you like to write next?

19:55.880 --> 20:01.640
I'll go, hmm, maybe a Re-envisioning of Encyclopedia Brown.

20:01.640 --> 20:03.040
That would be Heaven on Earth.

20:03.040 --> 20:04.040
Yeah.

20:04.040 --> 20:07.520
Or maybe a Young Tony Stark for the guys.

20:07.520 --> 20:14.800
Oh, this mystery is something I should really be saying to myself right now.

20:14.800 --> 20:15.800
Uh...

20:15.800 --> 20:18.600
It's just, it's just, it's just weird, right, Spencer?

20:18.600 --> 20:23.800
It's, it's almost too upsetting a joke to even try and ape and make fun of, you know?

20:23.800 --> 20:28.440
I'm kind of like not laughing at your making fun of it, that's how bad the original joke

20:28.440 --> 20:29.440
is.

20:29.440 --> 20:30.440
It's upsetting.

20:30.440 --> 20:44.840
Uh, our next, our next guest...

20:44.840 --> 20:47.120
Sometimes sadness can be its own segue.

20:47.120 --> 20:50.680
Yeah, yeah, I don't...

20:50.680 --> 20:56.480
Our next guest has appeared at clubs and colleges all over the, he's, he's certainly a, certainly

20:56.480 --> 21:01.080
a, a close cousin of the Harmontown family, but I don't know if he's ever been on Harmontown

21:01.080 --> 21:02.080
or not.

21:02.080 --> 21:03.080
I can't remember.

21:03.080 --> 21:04.080
I don't think he has.

21:04.080 --> 21:05.080
Well, let's ask him.

21:05.080 --> 21:06.880
Uh, certainly people that listen to this podcast...

21:06.880 --> 21:08.720
I just believe that we don't remember that answer.

21:08.720 --> 21:09.720
Probably know who he is.

21:09.720 --> 21:15.440
I, uh, I recently called, uh, made a, you know, called him out, uh, on his middle initial

21:15.440 --> 21:17.400
and demanded to see his birth certificate.

21:17.400 --> 21:21.040
I don't, I don't know if he's, I don't know if he's brought it or not, but, uh, let's,

21:21.040 --> 21:32.560
let's, let's, let's get to know Paul F. Tompkins, everybody.

21:32.560 --> 21:50.880
Hi, hi, everybody, hi, internet, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi,

21:50.880 --> 21:51.940
hi.

21:51.940 --> 21:53.500
Hi, hi.

21:53.500 --> 21:57.380
You received the one Dave Kline standing ovation?

21:57.380 --> 21:58.380
That's right.

21:58.380 --> 21:59.380
That's right.

21:59.380 --> 22:00.380
That's right.

22:00.380 --> 22:01.380
Uh, yeah.

22:01.380 --> 22:02.380
Uh, so, all right.

22:02.380 --> 22:03.380
A couple of things to get out of the way.

22:03.380 --> 22:04.380
Yeah.

22:04.380 --> 22:05.380
Let's get right down to it, Dan.

22:05.380 --> 22:06.380
Yeah.

22:06.380 --> 22:07.620
Well, I read, I don't know why I did this.

22:07.620 --> 22:12.940
I, I did no idea why I did this, I read an AV club comment section, uh...

22:12.940 --> 22:14.340
Oh no.

22:14.340 --> 22:18.480
Under, underneath a episode of Great Mines, this thing that you're going to do an episode

22:18.480 --> 22:24.480
on the, my thing on the History Channel, which has now been rebranded history, so that it's

22:24.480 --> 22:29.480
confusing. Because history is a thing, it's the opposite of branding. All right.

22:29.480 --> 22:36.480
So do you think people will look for the show just in history?

22:36.480 --> 22:41.480
They're like, dig up old tests that they took, that their mom saved in a shoebox.

22:41.480 --> 22:44.480
Was there anything about Dan Harmon's show in here?

22:44.480 --> 22:51.480
I understand what they're doing because they're saying, well, channel, that's my grandpa's TV's name.

22:51.480 --> 23:00.480
Because what's a channel, grandpa? But if you take the channel off of history, you have, like,

23:00.480 --> 23:04.480
you have just a word, a very, very, very vague word.

23:04.480 --> 23:08.480
And also a huge word that they're just laying claim to.

23:08.480 --> 23:09.480
Yeah.

23:09.480 --> 23:10.480
That's pretty bold.

23:10.480 --> 23:14.480
Yeah. It'll never, it'll never trend. It's as dumb as naming your show.

23:14.480 --> 23:15.480
It'll never trend.

23:15.480 --> 23:20.480
Yeah. It's as stupid as naming your TV show community or something like that.

23:20.480 --> 23:23.480
Like, hey, how come we're not trending?

23:23.480 --> 23:29.480
Oh, because you fucking, they had to take that word along with Justin Bieber and the out of the fucking

23:29.480 --> 23:34.480
trending algorithm.

23:34.480 --> 23:36.480
It's true.

23:36.480 --> 23:38.480
It's very true.

23:38.480 --> 23:41.480
The history channel is...

23:41.480 --> 23:43.480
Hi, Paul, I'm right behind you.

23:43.480 --> 23:46.480
I'm sorry, I should have told you, Paul. Jeff's here.

23:46.480 --> 23:48.480
The history channel is pretty light on history now.

23:48.480 --> 23:52.480
There's a lot of UFO things and lots of weird conspiracy shit.

23:52.480 --> 23:54.480
You're actually bringing it back.

23:54.480 --> 23:56.480
Well, with the comedy.

23:56.480 --> 24:01.480
I applaud that movement because we all love work, right?

24:01.480 --> 24:05.480
But speaking of which, so I saw, you know, I don't know, I'm going to read no AV Club review,

24:05.480 --> 24:07.480
let alone the comment section.

24:07.480 --> 24:09.480
I'm thinking, but then someone linked the thing.

24:09.480 --> 24:10.480
I don't know what it is.

24:10.480 --> 24:12.480
If someone tweets a link and says, like, this show's great.

24:12.480 --> 24:14.480
And then they tweet a link to the review.

24:14.480 --> 24:17.480
I'll get tricked into thinking it's okay to read the review.

24:17.480 --> 24:19.480
And then I'll scroll down.

24:19.480 --> 24:21.480
I don't know why am I scrolling down?

24:21.480 --> 24:24.480
What bad thing are they going to say about my stupid late night thing and the thing?

24:24.480 --> 24:28.480
So a big thing was that I ripped off Dead Authors podcast.

24:28.480 --> 24:30.480
Right.

24:30.480 --> 24:33.480
So sorry about that.

24:33.480 --> 24:38.480
Because somebody had said a similar thing to me, like, hey, isn't this the same idea?

24:38.480 --> 24:40.480
And it's not really the same idea.

24:40.480 --> 24:46.480
And also the idea for Dead Authors came from a Steve Allen show called Meeting of the Minds.

24:46.480 --> 24:51.480
Which is what this show came from as well by Rich Corson, the daily show guy who created the show

24:51.480 --> 24:56.480
and hired me to host this pilot that didn't get picked up by IFC and then handed over to the History Channel.

24:56.480 --> 25:02.480
Essentially, people, anyone who was old enough to remember Meeting of the Minds with Steve Allen had in the back of their head,

25:02.480 --> 25:04.480
I wish this show was entertaining.

25:04.480 --> 25:06.480
Yeah.

25:06.480 --> 25:11.480
And so eventually you grow up and you take power into your own hands.

25:11.480 --> 25:13.480
It's a podcast, it's audio only.

25:13.480 --> 25:16.480
Have you committed it to the lookies?

25:16.480 --> 25:22.480
I mean, we would do, like the live shows we would do in costume.

25:22.480 --> 25:26.480
Like we would do it, you know, in front of an audience, in costume, in character.

25:26.480 --> 25:28.480
Alright, so I ripped it off then.

25:28.480 --> 25:33.480
But it's not this, but I didn't come up with, I didn't come up with the Dead Authors concept.

25:33.480 --> 25:35.480
I just came up with the idea of doing it as a podcast.

25:35.480 --> 25:37.480
I got invited to do the show.

25:37.480 --> 25:43.480
It was invented by a guy named John Corn in San Francisco who worked for 826 up there.

25:43.480 --> 25:48.480
And the idea was they would get someone to pretend to be a Dead Author in costume

25:48.480 --> 25:52.480
and they would like do a Q&A with people, with an audience.

25:52.480 --> 25:58.480
And then I got asked to do it with Jen Kirkman and Eddie Pepitone for a show.

25:58.480 --> 26:03.480
It was the first time I did it and I, for whatever reason, decided to be HG Wells.

26:03.480 --> 26:07.480
And it was not decided beforehand how the show was going to go.

26:07.480 --> 26:12.480
And so the idea was the three of us would just go out in front of this audience of indifferent people

26:12.480 --> 26:18.480
and we would field questions from people who did not know what was going on and did not care.

26:18.480 --> 26:24.480
So I said, how about I moderate it in character and the whole conceit came up right then.

26:24.480 --> 26:28.480
It was like, let's say I transported you guys in my time machine which is real.

26:28.480 --> 26:32.480
And so I'll ask questions to get it going and then hopefully the audience would join in.

26:32.480 --> 26:39.480
Which they didn't except for one very drunk person at three in the afternoon at the West Hollywood Book Fair.

26:39.480 --> 26:42.480
And that was it and then it was a lot of fun.

26:42.480 --> 26:47.480
And I said, well this could easily be a regular show and that was it.

26:47.480 --> 26:50.480
So that sounds like it is derivative of it.

26:50.480 --> 26:56.480
I mean it sounds like it bumps enough that the people in that comment section weren't huge dicks by pointing it out.

26:56.480 --> 26:58.480
When there's a dot there, they'll connect it.

26:58.480 --> 27:00.480
Then they talked about my weight.

27:00.480 --> 27:06.480
Then they just didn't stop until it was rubble, just charred rubble.

27:06.480 --> 27:13.480
And I don't know, I don't understand, when did I start trying to convince people I was thin?

27:13.480 --> 27:18.480
How many times do I have to parade around and go, look how fat and drunk I am?

27:18.480 --> 27:23.480
Before the AV Club commenters stop trying to blow the fucking lid off of it like it's all the President's man or something.

27:23.480 --> 27:26.480
Like it's not a secret, but it hurts when you say it.

27:26.480 --> 27:27.480
It hurts when you say it.

27:27.480 --> 27:29.480
Because here's my one secret that I'm sensitive about.

27:29.480 --> 27:30.480
I'm a control freak.

27:30.480 --> 27:31.480
I don't want you saying it.

27:31.480 --> 27:33.480
I say it, I say it.

27:33.480 --> 27:35.480
Me.

27:35.480 --> 27:41.480
I don't like some fucking anonymous person sitting there in their basement in Washington State

27:41.480 --> 27:44.480
and fucking looks like somebody's been hitting the Hongadas.

27:44.480 --> 27:47.480
It's not fair.

27:47.480 --> 27:50.480
It's not funny and it's not fair.

27:50.480 --> 27:51.480
What show would you do?

27:51.480 --> 27:55.480
I bet you'd rip off a podcast too.

27:55.480 --> 27:59.480
What you're doing is talking about how fat people are.

27:59.480 --> 28:01.480
Is that a podcast?

28:01.480 --> 28:03.480
Is there someone hosting that?

28:03.480 --> 28:04.480
Surely someone is.

28:04.480 --> 28:05.480
There should be.

28:05.480 --> 28:06.480
Who's fat this week?

28:06.480 --> 28:08.480
Let's take a look.

28:08.480 --> 28:15.480
There should just be a comment section podcast where it's just like, welcome to what just

28:15.480 --> 28:18.480
happened.

28:18.480 --> 28:22.480
You know, Caterpillar 69, I don't know.

28:22.480 --> 28:24.480
I can't rip a name.

28:24.480 --> 28:28.480
I just typed that in at random when I logged in.

28:28.480 --> 28:30.480
So that just happened.

28:30.480 --> 28:33.480
I'd rather die than watch that again.

28:33.480 --> 28:40.480
They never tell you what they're commenting on, but they just... With me as always is

28:40.480 --> 28:47.480
the person who's going to turn this into either race or right versus left.

28:47.480 --> 28:53.480
It's very hard when you know those things are there and you read some of the links to

28:53.480 --> 28:54.480
a thing that you've done.

28:54.480 --> 29:00.480
It's very hard to have the self-control to not look at what people are saying.

29:00.480 --> 29:06.480
Even knowing that right under there, there's a bunch of fucking people talking about it

29:06.480 --> 29:08.480
and they're weighing in on what they think.

29:08.480 --> 29:09.480
It's so difficult.

29:09.480 --> 29:14.480
The only good thing was when community was running at its peak, if there was a bad review

29:14.480 --> 29:16.480
of a show, it was like, this episode wasn't that great.

29:16.480 --> 29:18.480
Then I'd go straight to the comment section.

29:18.480 --> 29:20.480
I was like, have Adam, boys.

29:20.480 --> 29:22.480
Pick that skeleton clean.

29:22.480 --> 29:28.480
There's something new to fucking eat up right above you.

29:28.480 --> 29:34.480
I said to Spencer on the way home, I was like, I did it the 800th time of 43 years old.

29:34.480 --> 29:36.480
I've learned this lesson over and over again.

29:36.480 --> 29:37.480
I don't know why I went there.

29:37.480 --> 29:42.480
The only thing you could say was it's just like picking a piece of glass up off the floor

29:42.480 --> 29:43.480
and just stabbing yourself in the face.

29:43.480 --> 29:44.480
I was in a really good mood.

29:44.480 --> 29:48.480
I went there because you really have to run the thought experiment of seriously, really

29:48.480 --> 29:54.480
seriously run the thought experiment of what happens the day that you click on the AV Club

29:54.480 --> 30:00.480
review and it says, well, whatever the review says, it's just a repeat of the press release.

30:00.480 --> 30:04.480
But then the top comment says like, Harmon's never looked better.

30:04.480 --> 30:07.480
I think this idea is very original.

30:07.480 --> 30:10.480
I think he's on top of his game as ever.

30:10.480 --> 30:11.480
Kudos to him.

30:11.480 --> 30:12.480
Hats off to him.

30:12.480 --> 30:17.480
Very funny, very young looking, very thin, very sober.

30:17.480 --> 30:19.480
I salute you, sir.

30:19.480 --> 30:23.480
And then every comment for a thousand comments was, couldn't agree more.

30:23.480 --> 30:24.480
Ditto.

30:24.480 --> 30:26.480
I second that.

30:26.480 --> 30:27.480
Here, here.

30:27.480 --> 30:29.480
The eyes have it.

30:29.480 --> 30:33.480
You would like scroll through that and then you'd go, well, I don't have to go there

30:33.480 --> 30:34.480
ever again.

30:34.480 --> 30:39.480
That, well, I don't know why I'm saying the editorial, you.

30:39.480 --> 30:45.480
I would scroll through and go, but that's not a real thing.

30:45.480 --> 30:51.480
Wouldn't a part of like yourself loathing, wouldn't, I mean, obviously it's this hypothetical

30:51.480 --> 30:55.480
thing, wouldn't you just automatically distrust all of that unanimous praise?

30:55.480 --> 30:57.480
Wouldn't you like find a way to.

30:57.480 --> 30:59.480
That's what I just said.

30:59.480 --> 31:00.480
Okay.

31:00.480 --> 31:06.480
How dare you criticize me or agree with me.

31:06.480 --> 31:10.480
Dan, you've never looked better.

31:10.480 --> 31:13.480
I could blow him up for the rest of the night.

31:13.480 --> 31:15.480
That guy's on the hook.

31:15.480 --> 31:17.480
He drank the Kool-Aid.

31:17.480 --> 31:19.480
I mean, that's terrible, right?

31:19.480 --> 31:23.480
You know, I always get mad when people tweet, they tweet at me and they go, by the way,

31:23.480 --> 31:27.480
we'll ask you some questions later.

31:27.480 --> 31:35.480
Are they about you?

31:35.480 --> 31:42.480
Bingo.

31:42.480 --> 31:44.480
I'll try to involve you in this.

31:44.480 --> 31:45.480
As best you can.

31:45.480 --> 31:54.480
Have people ever tweeted you and said, hey, either positively or negatively, but with

31:54.480 --> 32:03.480
the handle on it, of like, hey, I know you don't like it when people are positive, but.

32:03.480 --> 32:04.480
No.

32:04.480 --> 32:07.480
I have not gotten that specific.

32:07.480 --> 32:10.480
That's like a methodology I've fostered.

32:10.480 --> 32:11.480
People will go like.

32:11.480 --> 32:13.480
You don't like it when people are positive.

32:13.480 --> 32:16.480
There's two categories of that.

32:16.480 --> 32:21.480
People will go, hey, I know you don't respond to people being nice, so fuck off and your

32:21.480 --> 32:22.480
show's awful.

32:22.480 --> 32:23.480
And I'm like, okay, I get it.

32:23.480 --> 32:25.480
We've run that through the periscope and the mirror's bouncing.

32:25.480 --> 32:26.480
You're saying good show.

32:26.480 --> 32:29.480
Fuck off.

32:29.480 --> 32:34.480
Actually, the person that annoys me a little bit more is the sweet, nice person who's saying,

32:34.480 --> 32:42.480
hey, I just want to let you know, I really like Rick and Morty, but I know you don't

32:42.480 --> 32:48.480
care about people who like your stuff, but I thought I'd tell you anyway.

32:48.480 --> 32:53.480
And I always take back those people, fuck you.

32:53.480 --> 32:56.480
That's fair.

32:56.480 --> 33:01.480
But you interact with people a lot online, right?

33:01.480 --> 33:03.480
So they know.

33:03.480 --> 33:11.480
But I mean, the thing is, because I don't respond to a ton of people and I don't really

33:11.480 --> 33:17.480
I don't really, I don't like respond to any, certainly not anything negative unless I am

33:17.480 --> 33:22.480
a thousand percent sure that I am, it doesn't bother me.

33:22.480 --> 33:23.480
Do you know what I mean?

33:23.480 --> 33:26.480
Like I can make a joke out of it and I can quote the thing that they said and make a

33:26.480 --> 33:27.480
joke out of it.

33:27.480 --> 33:30.480
If I just think, oh, this is dumb and it doesn't actually hurt my feelings.

33:30.480 --> 33:33.480
I just saw the hateful eight last night.

33:33.480 --> 33:39.480
You're, Tim Roth's character says, if you're, if you're, if you're, when you're hanging

33:39.480 --> 33:44.480
somebody, if it's, if there's an ounce of passion to it, you maybe shouldn't be hanging

33:44.480 --> 33:45.480
them.

33:45.480 --> 33:50.480
So when you're responding to a tweet, you're, I think that's what you're saying is like,

33:50.480 --> 33:54.480
you run it through a filter of like, am I, is there anything happening here where I'm

33:54.480 --> 34:00.480
just not like kind of like, you know, a good professional like dealer or pit boss at the

34:00.480 --> 34:05.480
Tompkins casino, just, just doing my job, entertaining, like, like, like making sure everybody's

34:05.480 --> 34:07.480
like being dealt with fairly.

34:07.480 --> 34:11.480
Obviously what it is, if, if it makes me laugh, if it's like someone's trying to say a mean

34:11.480 --> 34:13.480
thing, but it just makes me laugh.

34:13.480 --> 34:14.480
I'm like, oh, this is great.

34:14.480 --> 34:16.480
And then I will tweet that out.

34:16.480 --> 34:20.480
But I, so I don't, I don't respond a lot because it's like, where does, to me it's like, where

34:20.480 --> 34:21.480
does it end?

34:21.480 --> 34:22.480
You know,

34:22.480 --> 34:24.480
You may have someone insults you and it's funny.

34:24.480 --> 34:25.480
You'll retweet it.

34:25.480 --> 34:26.480
Is that what you're saying?

34:26.480 --> 34:27.480
If they're trying to,

34:27.480 --> 34:29.480
If it's so absurd that it doesn't, it doesn't hurt his feet.

34:29.480 --> 34:30.480
Yes.

34:30.480 --> 34:32.480
If the intent was to hurt my feelings, but it failed.

34:32.480 --> 34:33.480
Yeah.

34:33.480 --> 34:36.480
But, but if you, if you felt any wound or any passion in it or any like, I gotta, I gotta

34:36.480 --> 34:37.480
settle the score.

34:37.480 --> 34:38.480
You, you, you leave,

34:38.480 --> 34:39.480
I will not give it attention.

34:39.480 --> 34:40.480
You leave that one alone.

34:40.480 --> 34:41.480
Yes.

34:41.480 --> 34:42.480
That's very wise.

34:42.480 --> 34:43.480
It's very smart.

34:43.480 --> 34:46.480
As a result, I think because you do interact with people so much, there are people that

34:46.480 --> 34:48.480
just want your attention in some way or another.

34:48.480 --> 34:49.480
Right.

34:49.480 --> 34:54.480
And so, and I've seen this happen with other people where I've seen like somebody right,

34:54.480 --> 34:59.480
like to, uh, I forget who it was, but they wrote a bunch of positive things, didn't get

34:59.480 --> 35:03.480
a response, and then wrote a negative thing just to get a response from this person.

35:03.480 --> 35:05.480
And then they said, this is why I did this.

35:05.480 --> 35:06.480
Yeah.

35:06.480 --> 35:09.980
And that has to be a huge, I'm sure you know this, that, that has to be a giant part of

35:09.980 --> 35:14.480
people poking you is because they know that you might, you might fire back at them.

35:14.480 --> 35:15.480
Right.

35:15.480 --> 35:20.980
But, but what I've, what I find over and over and over again is that there's, that, that

35:20.980 --> 35:29.080
eventually they will, they will unfollow me and block me because they don't want just

35:29.080 --> 35:30.080
attention.

35:30.080 --> 35:35.460
It's like, and I'm obsessed with, I was obsessed with that, like going, going like, so that's

35:35.460 --> 35:36.460
the game we're playing.

35:36.460 --> 35:39.600
Like you just want my attention because then they go through all the phases where they're

35:39.600 --> 35:41.960
like, what kind of loser are you paying attention to me?

35:41.960 --> 35:44.960
And then it's like three days later, they're like, leave me alone.

35:44.960 --> 35:47.960
And I'm like, are we, are we, what are we done?

35:47.960 --> 35:51.040
I want to talk to you.

35:51.040 --> 35:54.440
You got Dan Harmon on the line once you, what's, what's going on?

35:54.440 --> 35:55.440
How's your mom?

35:55.440 --> 35:56.440
How's your blog?

35:56.440 --> 36:04.320
Uh, but anyways, the, the, I would say that people like, like absolutely, of course all

36:04.320 --> 36:10.000
this is true, but when, when, when you, when you send a positive tweet to somebody, uh,

36:10.000 --> 36:14.120
you know, no news is good news.

36:14.120 --> 36:15.560
Like, like, like, you know,

36:15.560 --> 36:18.480
Well, you, you, you pays your money and he takes your chances.

36:18.480 --> 36:19.480
You know what I mean?

36:19.480 --> 36:21.120
Like you, you write a thing out there.

36:21.120 --> 36:24.640
The idea is that you write a thing because this is genuinely how you feel.

36:24.640 --> 36:25.640
Right.

36:25.640 --> 36:28.720
It's not supposed to be about, you know, what you, of course you hope that someone will

36:28.720 --> 36:29.720
respond.

36:29.720 --> 36:33.280
I've written positive things to people that I admired, you know, after like hearing an

36:33.280 --> 36:35.520
album or watching a TV show or whatever.

36:35.520 --> 36:36.520
No response.

36:36.520 --> 36:39.120
And it's like, Oh, it would have been nice if the person said something, but I didn't

36:39.120 --> 36:40.320
feel like I was owed that.

36:40.320 --> 36:42.120
Tell us who it was.

36:42.120 --> 36:46.720
Mariah Carey, Mariah Carey.

36:46.720 --> 36:51.480
When she split up with Tommy Matola, I was so proud of her and I was like, I wish someone

36:51.480 --> 36:53.720
would have been Twitter so I could tell her all about it.

36:53.720 --> 36:57.680
I'm not good on the timeline with when Mariah Carey left Tommy Matola.

36:57.680 --> 36:58.680
I can't remember.

36:58.680 --> 36:59.960
Twitter was in her lives at that point.

36:59.960 --> 37:01.480
Why is his mic so loud?

37:01.480 --> 37:02.480
Are you an auctioneer?

37:02.480 --> 37:03.480
Yeah.

37:03.480 --> 37:04.480
I am.

37:04.480 --> 37:07.040
I'm like a slow roll auctioneer.

37:07.040 --> 37:09.040
Paul, I don't do the fast.

37:09.040 --> 37:11.040
Paul, what is the next item up for auction?

37:11.040 --> 37:12.200
What is the next item up for bid?

37:12.200 --> 37:15.040
It is a pair of jackalope antlers.

37:15.040 --> 37:22.240
This whimsical gift can be found all over the Tex-Mex areas of the country.

37:22.240 --> 37:24.240
What's our starting price?

37:24.240 --> 37:25.240
$1.

37:25.240 --> 37:27.480
Do you have a yop?

37:27.480 --> 37:30.880
Is that my, is that my, is that my imagination?

37:30.880 --> 37:33.880
Because I think he just got such a strange theater voice.

37:33.880 --> 37:35.880
I'm also yelling.

37:35.880 --> 37:40.040
Is that, no, it told me not to yell.

37:40.040 --> 37:42.360
So I've been yelling the whole time.

37:42.360 --> 37:47.280
I've never trusted these things.

37:47.280 --> 37:52.440
Dan, Dan, what percentage of your replies to people, do you ever reply to positive stuff?

37:52.440 --> 37:53.440
Do you go, hey, thank you.

37:53.440 --> 37:54.440
Nice to hear from you.

37:54.440 --> 37:55.440
Absolutely.

37:55.440 --> 37:56.440
Okay.

37:56.440 --> 37:57.440
So does that even out?

37:57.440 --> 37:58.440
Is it 55?

37:58.440 --> 38:04.280
I mean, in the fucking 38 years I've been on Twitter, whatever it's been, I've gone through

38:04.280 --> 38:07.400
different phases where, because that stuff got to me where I'd make sure I'd actually

38:07.400 --> 38:14.040
count and I'd go, okay, 50%, like, just to shove it up the ass of the people I hate.

38:14.040 --> 38:15.720
I'm like, thank you, Nancy.

38:15.720 --> 38:20.480
Very nice to be said, blah, blah, blah.

38:20.480 --> 38:22.440
Fucking asshole on that guy back there.

38:22.440 --> 38:25.640
You know, like it's still worshiping at the altar of hatred.

38:25.640 --> 38:26.640
Hey, Paul.

38:26.640 --> 38:27.640
Yeah.

38:27.640 --> 38:29.320
How many suits made?

38:29.320 --> 38:32.560
I don't have a lot of suits made for myself.

38:32.560 --> 38:34.080
I buy a lot of stuff off the rack.

38:34.080 --> 38:35.080
You do.

38:35.080 --> 38:39.640
I've had my wedding suit made for me by Mr. Lee of Fairfax Avenue.

38:39.640 --> 38:40.640
Yeah.

38:40.640 --> 38:41.640
Very grumpy.

38:41.640 --> 38:43.120
Taylor, who did a wonderful job making my suit.

38:43.120 --> 38:44.120
Taylor's should be grumpy in my experience.

38:44.120 --> 38:52.640
Is it true that Mr. Lee was killed by the triads for sharing his suitmaking secrets?

38:52.640 --> 38:55.920
That's the story they'd like you to believe.

38:55.920 --> 38:59.320
Now your mic is way too quiet.

38:59.320 --> 39:00.320
Because he's not yelling.

39:00.320 --> 39:08.200
I thought we were getting quiet, talking about the triads.

39:08.200 --> 39:10.000
It's called modulation, dad.

39:10.000 --> 39:12.640
He's got dynamism.

39:12.640 --> 39:13.640
He's got levels.

39:13.640 --> 39:15.480
Are you hearing me exclusively through the system?

39:15.480 --> 39:16.480
I don't know what it is.

39:16.480 --> 39:17.480
No.

39:17.480 --> 39:20.000
Because we're sitting a foot from each other.

39:20.000 --> 39:24.160
When I listen to Jeff, like, I actually, it sounds, I mean, it's just, we're amplified.

39:24.160 --> 39:28.200
I don't know why it's taken me 200 shows to figure this out.

39:28.200 --> 39:31.360
Why is this guy so loud?

39:31.360 --> 39:32.360
What's that stick he's holding?

39:32.360 --> 39:36.120
Why doesn't he lick his ice cream cone?

39:36.120 --> 39:37.360
Who eats black ice cream?

39:37.360 --> 39:42.560
Who's ice cream matches their cone?

39:42.560 --> 39:44.320
I bet that's a problem for someone.

39:44.320 --> 39:51.720
I bet there's people that can't eat ice cream in a cone because they would like the ice

39:51.720 --> 39:53.640
cream to be the same color as the cone.

39:53.640 --> 39:56.000
And so they're stuck with, like, coffee.

39:56.000 --> 39:57.000
Yeah.

39:57.000 --> 40:00.920
You could maybe some butter pecan, maybe it would be a close, right?

40:00.920 --> 40:02.640
You're talking about monochromophiliacs.

40:02.640 --> 40:03.640
Yeah.

40:03.640 --> 40:04.640
Yeah.

40:04.640 --> 40:08.320
I bet that's the case.

40:08.320 --> 40:09.960
I bet those people...

40:09.960 --> 40:12.160
Let's make the rest of the show about that.

40:12.160 --> 40:13.880
All right.

40:13.880 --> 40:15.760
I dare us.

40:15.760 --> 40:18.680
I mean, is it, do you think it applies specifically to food?

40:18.680 --> 40:19.680
It's just food.

40:19.680 --> 40:23.480
I need all my food to be the same color, or I can't eat.

40:23.480 --> 40:24.480
The fictional people?

40:24.480 --> 40:25.480
Yeah.

40:25.480 --> 40:26.480
What's that?

40:26.480 --> 40:27.480
It's sexual.

40:27.480 --> 40:28.480
It's sexual?

40:28.480 --> 40:29.480
All right.

40:29.480 --> 40:30.480
The perfect chiming.

40:30.480 --> 40:35.480
That works for every day.

40:35.480 --> 40:38.680
He says that every five minutes regardless of the topic.

40:38.680 --> 40:48.120
Yesterday, we were like, we do the show every day, we're like, what's the real deal between

40:48.120 --> 40:50.560
the Hillary supporters and the Bernie supporters?

40:50.560 --> 40:56.520
It's sexual, which is what got Gloria Steinem in all kinds of trouble.

40:56.520 --> 40:57.920
Right.

40:57.920 --> 41:03.360
But even a broken clock is right twice a day.

41:03.360 --> 41:06.560
I don't know.

41:06.560 --> 41:11.560
I guess when in doubt, make the offended sound, is that what we meant?

41:11.560 --> 41:14.560
They were like, hey, oh, oh, oh, oh.

41:14.560 --> 41:15.560
Wait a minute, Paul.

41:15.560 --> 41:16.560
Yes, yes, yes.

41:16.560 --> 41:17.560
Paul.

41:17.560 --> 41:18.560
Yes.

41:18.560 --> 41:19.560
You had one suit.

41:19.560 --> 41:23.240
I'm assuming you still have it and you haven't had it destroyed.

41:23.240 --> 41:24.240
It's a fantastic suit.

41:24.240 --> 41:27.560
I never wear a suit more than once.

41:27.560 --> 41:28.560
That is eccentric.

41:28.560 --> 41:29.560
And I love that.

41:29.560 --> 41:34.400
You have a suit that is exactly the mayor from JAWS's suit with the anchors on it.

41:34.400 --> 41:35.560
That suit I had made as well.

41:35.560 --> 41:36.560
Of course.

41:36.560 --> 41:37.640
You didn't get that off the rack.

41:37.640 --> 41:40.880
That was made by Cebo.

41:40.880 --> 41:44.200
Not far from here, a few doors down from the improv.

41:44.200 --> 41:47.960
This guy, Cebo, makes, he was recommended to me by Dana Gould, very funny comedian.

41:47.960 --> 41:49.480
I love Dana Gould.

41:49.480 --> 41:58.480
And I had wanted, since I was a child, the blazer that the mayor wears in JAWS is covered

41:58.480 --> 41:59.480
with anchors.

41:59.480 --> 42:01.480
It's like a powder blue kind of thing.

42:01.480 --> 42:03.480
It's beautiful.

42:03.480 --> 42:04.480
It's triumphant.

42:04.480 --> 42:05.480
It is triumphant.

42:05.480 --> 42:10.480
It is a sartorial triumph.

42:10.480 --> 42:14.480
And so I searched everywhere for it to not find it.

42:14.480 --> 42:21.480
No, Larry King, Larry Storch, Larry Gilmore, big point.

42:21.480 --> 42:22.480
Shit.

42:22.480 --> 42:23.480
Damn it.

42:23.480 --> 42:24.480
Sensitive, brother.

42:24.480 --> 42:26.480
No, the character's name is Larry.

42:26.480 --> 42:27.480
Larry Vaughn.

42:27.480 --> 42:28.480
All right.

42:28.480 --> 42:29.480
No, we'll look it up.

42:29.480 --> 42:30.480
Sorry.

42:30.480 --> 42:31.480
Murray Hamilton.

42:31.480 --> 42:32.480
Murray Hamilton.

42:32.480 --> 42:33.480
Okay.

42:33.480 --> 42:34.480
Now you're yelling.

42:34.480 --> 42:35.480
Now you're yelling.

42:35.480 --> 42:36.480
It's sexual.

42:36.480 --> 42:37.480
Okay.

42:37.480 --> 42:38.480
See?

42:38.480 --> 42:42.680
That didn't even apply.

42:42.680 --> 42:44.680
So I searched high and low for this jacket.

42:44.680 --> 42:45.680
Oh, tell him.

42:45.680 --> 42:46.680
He's the one that cares about your suit.

42:46.680 --> 42:47.680
That's true.

42:47.680 --> 42:48.680
That's true.

42:48.680 --> 42:49.680
So I searched high and low.

42:49.680 --> 42:53.960
There's two different podcasts going on here.

42:53.960 --> 43:02.360
I couldn't find the jacket itself, but then I talked about it on another podcast.

43:02.360 --> 43:07.280
And someone sent me a link to the material, and they said, here's where you can find

43:07.280 --> 43:08.440
this material.

43:08.440 --> 43:10.200
They have the material laying about?

43:10.200 --> 43:11.200
They have the material laying about.

43:11.200 --> 43:12.760
And it's close enough.

43:12.760 --> 43:13.760
Close enough.

43:13.760 --> 43:19.360
And so I get a few yards of this fabric, and I take it to the Maestro, Sibo.

43:19.360 --> 43:20.360
And he's very excited.

43:20.360 --> 43:22.040
He likes making unusual stuff.

43:22.040 --> 43:23.840
So he was very excited.

43:23.840 --> 43:26.160
And it was perfect.

43:26.160 --> 43:29.840
It was like I had enough material to make not just the jacket, but entire suit, entire

43:29.840 --> 43:30.840
three-piece suit.

43:30.840 --> 43:31.840
You made the vest too?

43:31.840 --> 43:32.840
Yeah.

43:32.840 --> 43:33.840
Fantastic.

43:33.840 --> 43:34.840
All right.

43:34.840 --> 43:35.840
I'm going to go back to my podium, Paul.

43:35.840 --> 43:36.840
Great talking to you.

43:36.840 --> 43:37.840
Jeff, always a pleasure.

43:37.840 --> 43:48.200
That was a taste of Jeff's new Feral Audio podcast.

43:48.200 --> 43:50.400
Jeff Onman.

43:50.400 --> 43:51.400
Suits.

43:51.400 --> 43:52.400
Meets.

43:52.400 --> 43:59.040
I listened for it.

43:59.040 --> 44:00.040
It's sexual.

44:00.040 --> 44:07.880
How long have you been married?

44:07.880 --> 44:08.880
I've been married.

44:08.880 --> 44:12.720
It will be six years this month.

44:12.720 --> 44:13.720
Wow.

44:13.720 --> 44:14.720
Okay.

44:14.720 --> 44:15.720
Was that allowed?

44:15.720 --> 44:16.720
Did they turn my mic up?

44:16.720 --> 44:17.720
It'll be six years this month.

44:17.720 --> 44:18.720
I'm sorry.

44:18.720 --> 44:19.720
Paul, we didn't get that.

44:19.720 --> 44:20.720
Can we do it again?

44:20.720 --> 44:21.720
I will be married this month.

44:21.720 --> 44:22.720
I'm sorry.

44:22.720 --> 44:23.720
I'm sorry.

44:23.720 --> 44:24.720
Paul, we didn't get that.

44:24.720 --> 44:25.720
Can we do it again?

44:25.720 --> 44:26.720
I will be married this month.

44:26.720 --> 44:27.720
I'm sorry.

44:27.720 --> 44:28.720
I'm sorry.

44:28.720 --> 44:29.720
I'm sorry.

44:29.720 --> 44:30.720
We didn't get that.

44:30.720 --> 44:31.720
We didn't.

44:31.720 --> 44:32.720
It took, it took.

44:32.720 --> 44:33.720
It took.

44:33.720 --> 44:34.720
So far so good.

44:34.720 --> 44:35.720
It took.

44:35.720 --> 44:37.840
What's your secret, Paul?

44:37.840 --> 44:40.680
What's you and your wife's secret?

44:40.680 --> 44:43.540
We don't spend a lot of time together.

44:43.540 --> 44:45.640
We have separate residences.

44:45.640 --> 44:48.120
I've never actually gotten married.

44:48.120 --> 44:50.640
And we're not married.

44:50.640 --> 44:52.840
And it's great.

44:52.840 --> 45:00.600
she's a mirror I get dressed up as a parakeet and just just pack her I put

45:00.600 --> 45:13.320
lipstick on here so I know it's not me it's not another me I don't think that

45:13.320 --> 45:20.880
six years is long enough to say I here's the secret to marriage it is now

45:20.880 --> 45:26.560
it's getting pretty close I mean well it's like I but I I think that we're

45:26.560 --> 45:30.360
going to go the distance but you don't know you know you don't know and you

45:30.360 --> 45:36.280

45:56.840 --> 46:02.760

I'm gonna say we were together for five years before we got married for holy

46:07.400 --> 46:11.040
smoke wow we'll see there's a good secret right there it's like it's like

46:11.040 --> 46:14.520

46:14.520 --> 46:22.400
sailboat going on underneath the water ooh it's sexual you're lead up you know

46:22.400 --> 46:29.160
yeah which is not to say anybody who's listening oh you know you dated for three

46:29.160 --> 46:32.400
months and you love each other get married I'm just saying like like people

46:32.400 --> 46:36.920
who Schrab I officiated his wedding he'd been living with Kate for seven years

46:36.920 --> 46:40.640
they say they I mean give me a break they're not they're not gonna like come

46:40.640 --> 46:47.000
home from from the wedding and be like you chew your cereal like I know I know

46:47.000 --> 46:52.960
you why don't you chew your cereal you're gonna choke to death I am sick of

46:52.960 --> 47:01.560
giving you the Heimlich every morning because it dilutes the taste to chew it

47:01.560 --> 47:09.920
and yet ironically the generation's preceding us as the sort of a version

47:09.920 --> 47:14.200
to living in sin increases so does it seems the longevity of the marriage

47:14.200 --> 47:18.840
right Schrab's parents were probably who probably I'm gonna guess I don't want to

47:18.840 --> 47:22.040
get invasive here probably didn't bone till our wedding night I don't know they

47:22.040 --> 47:24.760
they married right out of high school they were here on the show they were

47:24.760 --> 47:29.560
boning baby they're they've been married 50 years and it's like oh my god the

47:29.560 --> 47:41.160
it's sexual who knows I don't know where's this going I mean that's the

47:41.160 --> 47:44.800
thing is that no there's no I don't think there's any I don't think there are

47:44.800 --> 47:49.800
any guarantees and I don't think anyone people are individuals and they and they

47:49.800 --> 47:54.560
have their own methods of doing things and anyone who has something successful

47:54.560 --> 47:58.520
whether it's a career whether it's a marriage whatever they assume that their

47:58.520 --> 48:02.920
way is the only way because results speak for themselves but that advice might

48:02.920 --> 48:07.960
not apply to other individuals it's like you just can't live your life by other

48:07.960 --> 48:12.160
people's example what if we all applied the Jim Belushi method of becoming as

48:12.160 --> 48:18.920
famous as Jim Belushi where we made our brothers become famous listen you're

48:18.920 --> 48:23.040
gonna help me out here I need you to become famous then get out of the way

48:23.040 --> 48:27.720
if you know what I mean everyone misses you they're like he kind of looks like

48:27.720 --> 48:35.280
him you know what Paul easy target come on

48:35.280 --> 48:39.840

based on actual like like good matches for you is your wife Paul Rudd that

50:27.760 --> 50:40.520
would be great very close Paula Rudd Rudd Smith all right she's an actor we

50:40.520 --> 50:55.600
won't drag her into this her name is Janie she is an actress she is from

50:55.600 --> 51:01.200
South Carolina we met in 2003 through mutual friends who are the mutual friends

51:01.200 --> 51:09.520
the mutual friends are Paul Rudd Nicole Kidman and Paula Rudd interestingly we

51:09.520 --> 51:13.960
both sort of knew Paul Rudd independently of each other and my wife

51:13.960 --> 51:20.760
spent her I want to say 30th birthday at the disgusting karaoke bar primetime

51:20.760 --> 51:25.800
here in Los Angeles with Paul Rudd huh and some other people she was she was

51:25.800 --> 51:30.200
working at I believe she's working M bar at the time as a waitress she was

51:30.200 --> 51:33.560
working as a waitress in a cocktail bar when I met her do you meet her doing she

51:33.560 --> 51:40.200
what he literally was did you M bar then so did you per chance meet her doing

51:40.200 --> 51:46.560
Beth Lapidus a show no I did not I did not set foot into M bar I think until

51:46.560 --> 51:52.320
after we had started dating already oh so I met her at a different bar okay and

51:52.320 --> 51:56.640
I was I was leaving as she was arriving we overlap briefly and we met then Paul

51:56.640 --> 52:04.960
what year did you I'm right behind you where did you move to LA from Philadelphia

52:04.960 --> 52:09.480
Pennsylvania what year did you come here 1994 now I remember seeing you in a very

52:09.480 --> 52:15.280
early days stand-up show at the Onyx cafe on Vermont which is no longer there

52:15.280 --> 52:19.360
yes and it was really early days and I'd never heard seen you before also it's

52:19.360 --> 52:22.760
the first time I ever saw Sarah Silverman sure I think it might have been

52:22.760 --> 52:26.800
tenacious D's first show they ever did was there I think their first show was

52:26.800 --> 52:31.080
at Al's bar a really I talked to Jack about this and he goes that might have

52:31.080 --> 52:38.480
been our first or second show but he wasn't sure second all right but I got

52:38.480 --> 52:41.520
to say I remember two things about you I remember okay this guy's really funny

52:41.520 --> 52:45.000
and I liked your style and you had a great vocabulary and a great command of

52:45.000 --> 52:50.000
the English language but also your suit rumbled you had a rumbled suit and then

52:50.000 --> 52:52.360
I was like that's the guy with the rumble suit but now you've come you've

52:52.360 --> 52:57.400
become this like exquisitely dressed gentleman and I love that about you I

52:57.400 --> 53:01.440
think I just could not afford to have things not rumbled in those days I think

53:01.440 --> 53:07.400
I think that was like all of us back there yeah see what I first saw you

53:07.400 --> 53:18.000
suit smooth as silk I thought could you it could be a little funnier so I don't

53:18.000 --> 53:23.160
know if that was still true I thought I didn't

53:23.160 --> 53:27.440
vert the dichotomy I guess this is what I was doing are you still are you still

53:27.440 --> 53:32.800
doing that speakeasy show no I resigned from that I did it for a while and it

53:32.800 --> 53:36.600
was I enjoyed doing it for I was an interview series and I interviewed Dan

53:36.600 --> 53:40.080
on it and we had a lovely chat but it's still available you can still find it on

53:40.080 --> 53:46.440
YouTube but I did it for a while and then it just became another thing to

53:46.440 --> 53:51.160
schedule in my life and that the returns were diminishing it was because we would

53:51.160 --> 53:56.600
shoot them four at a time yeah and so like the first couple interviews like

53:56.600 --> 54:03.840
this is fun this is great then Marc Maron came and you walked away from that

54:03.840 --> 54:10.000
one you're like what am I doing I did it so long after Marc Maron believe it or

54:10.000 --> 54:17.840
not for like maximum self destructiveness it was fun for a while but

54:17.840 --> 54:22.320
then I eventually it was I had other things going on and it was like it just

54:22.320 --> 54:25.680
wasn't stopping fun yeah stopping fun you will find when you come and do this

54:25.680 --> 54:34.520
show for the for history for the history flux that I am approaching that event

54:34.520 --> 54:43.320
horizon burnout I may be a husk of a man when you have you shot so far I've

54:43.320 --> 54:48.120
lost count which is good something like 9 or 9 or 10 they've all been great over

54:48.120 --> 54:56.840
there oh yeah Spencer have you been here this whole time yeah I didn't have

54:56.840 --> 55:07.480
anything to chime in until just right there about 9 you know that's what I

55:07.480 --> 55:12.560
got Spencer are you enjoying being an actor on the show you it's it's weird I

55:12.560 --> 55:16.560
mean the hard part about acting as best I could tell is memorizing and reciting

55:16.560 --> 55:21.640
lines and we kind of do it all improv-y style so it's just like whatever you

55:21.640 --> 55:25.240
think of to say just say it and you know it's a lot easier when you're not

55:25.240 --> 55:31.800
trying to hit lines yeah and by the way I know it gets frustrating when I come

55:31.800 --> 55:35.160
in and I go this script is done we'll throw it out we're gonna improvise the

55:35.160 --> 55:39.680
stuff but then when you you did a whole scene he did like what an hour and a half

55:39.680 --> 55:44.720
two hours of straight improv with Nick Kroll just two so it's like like it was

55:44.720 --> 55:50.520
Kroll I'm not spoiling anything Kroll plays Sigmund Freud and he he psycho

55:50.520 --> 55:58.640
analyzed Spencer for two hours it was all one take and Spencer just just

55:58.640 --> 56:03.680
answered honestly the perfect actor like you do you're acting perfectly and

56:03.680 --> 56:08.680
then and then and then and then Steve Levy came in and played himself and he

56:08.680 --> 56:15.880
did it perfectly too but we're not gonna do two-hour takes right no no no are we

56:15.880 --> 56:19.800
allowed to are we allowed to know who Paul's going to portray yeah well I yeah

56:19.800 --> 56:26.280
unless you have some reason to not I'm cool with this I'm cool with it being

56:26.280 --> 56:29.800
out there I like teasing it I believe you're gonna play Edgar Allen Poe that's

56:29.800 --> 56:32.320
correct yeah

56:32.320 --> 56:38.400
got a pro fans who has who has figured into my life in a weird way because the the place

56:38.400 --> 56:42.240
where my wife grew up on Sullivan's Island South Carolina there's a lot of

56:42.240 --> 56:47.880
post of there because he spent as Edgar Allen Poe seemingly did all over the

56:47.880 --> 56:53.120
fucking place he spent a good amount of his life there and his story the

56:53.120 --> 56:58.120
Goldbug is inspired by Goldbug Island there in South Carolina what happens

56:58.120 --> 57:02.320
in the Goldbug I have no idea I remember the Goldbug from the Richard

57:02.320 --> 57:09.880
scary novels who's a children's author and no it's scary or scary I never knew

57:09.880 --> 57:13.680
how to pronounce his name oh I always said because he's got the two R's oh is

57:13.680 --> 57:17.200
this another day that it's team bears either way it's terrifying either way

57:17.200 --> 57:22.040
it's it's terrifying there's a kids show and they said scary so I think yeah

57:22.040 --> 57:29.960
it's scary oh you're gonna trust LeVar Burton yeah how's that working out for

57:29.960 --> 57:44.200
you remember that's probably why I got divorced LeVar and he'll fire back no

57:44.200 --> 57:48.740
that's why I didn't come because I knew you weren't gonna stay married it's gonna

57:48.740 --> 57:53.640
go back and forth it's gonna be a whole thing me and LeVar Burton and then it's

57:53.640 --> 57:57.240
like you have to go back through the tweets to see where it started who was

57:57.240 --> 58:01.840
the first one yeah and it's like it all starts with him going like hey I know

58:01.840 --> 58:09.160
you don't respond to positive shit so fuck off do you have children no yeah

58:09.160 --> 58:15.080
that's something that sounds like you don't want to know I don't think we do

58:15.080 --> 58:19.360
yeah I don't think we do not looking for no here's something I get children too

58:19.360 --> 58:25.000
many of them there's plenty to go around they could be as offended as they

58:25.000 --> 58:35.000
want of that children themselves would be offended children well who would be

58:35.000 --> 58:38.280
like two people who had kids and oh yes they're listening with you would be

58:38.280 --> 58:48.320
like hey we had kids like well yeah more food for him some of somebody's

58:48.320 --> 58:52.200
gonna stop the hardest part of being a parent is going to where the child food

58:52.200 --> 58:56.960
is kept and there's like all these other children and it's like how are we gonna

58:56.960 --> 59:00.400
get in there because they're just like kids are like spin over the trough and

59:00.400 --> 59:08.920
they're just like and then a kid falls in red light goes on everyone out we got

59:08.920 --> 59:12.840
an Augustus Gloop situation here

59:17.920 --> 59:29.600
do you want to be a dad I I I I I I I I'm so old now anyway like like who care

59:29.600 --> 59:34.400
you know like I don't know I used to think like the second half of a full

59:34.400 --> 59:39.320
life would you know involve having kids and but but like I'm I'm I'm now post

59:39.320 --> 59:45.240
divorce I'm like sort of I I figure I I made mistakes that affected other

59:45.240 --> 59:48.720
people's lives by making assumptions about what I was supposed to do what I

59:48.720 --> 01:00:02.720
wanted to do it's sexual but and so I'm just sort of in this clean slate kind

01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:08.080
of mode where I'm fetishizing uncertainty my therapist told me don't be

01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:16.120
certain about anything Dan Harmon oh it's very formal yeah because she said I

01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:22.000
in particular have a problem with certainty well who doesn't I mean I sure

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:29.720
lack homes like you it's just a good man you fucking nailed it look I asked an

01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:38.160
answer moving on mr. Rourke night the car a night writer kid I want I am on the

01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:43.800
verge of the rewatching fantasy island I don't know what we're gonna remake that

01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:47.160
show I think that which they do you remember when they remitted with what's

01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:52.160
his name with Malcolm McDowell no they did it for yeah there was a brief I

01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:55.760
mean not not Malcolm McDowell I don't care you're fine there was a brief weird

01:00:55.760 --> 01:01:00.840
remake with I don't I mean like cuz it's I just Chris McKenna and I I was

01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:06.800
talking about fantasy island because I it's like there was this show kids it

01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:11.480
was a it was it was it was prime time it was it was it was as well regarded as

01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:17.240
oranges the new black it was like it was we didn't have we didn't we hadn't

01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:23.080
splintered our audience into a million pieces back that it was like the I feel

01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:39.480
that is a tad misleading I mean what at the water cooler just going did you see

01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:44.040
it last night yes I did they talked about it but I would not say it was held

01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:48.520
in the same regard as this I felt that fantasy island dealt with queer issues

01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:53.280
pretty much the same way yeah you guys are talking about content and

01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:56.480
specificity of that stuff I'm talking about culturally back then there were

01:01:56.480 --> 01:02:03.360
three networks the Incredible Hulk series won the Emmy for best dramatic series

01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:09.920
pretty dramatic show fairness the winner of the best best female lead in a

01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:14.040
dramatic series was the bionic woman this before they changed the name of the

01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:21.680
category what wait what is it I think it's best actress that's sexist it used

01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:24.920
to be best best female lead

01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:34.280
the anyways fantasy island was a show where a sea plane would land and a guy

01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:41.240
going from the very beginning yeah they don't know a guy in a white suit would

01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:47.240
come out because first what would happen is it is a little person would go to

01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:52.160
plane to plane boss to plane and then the sea plane would land and this title

01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:54.680
sequence from fantasy island fantasy island is his resort where all your

01:02:54.680 --> 01:02:58.400
fantasies come true now here you're gonna have a million questions in a

01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:03.320
socket because a sea plane would land and three guest stars would get off and

01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:08.080
same as the love boat except on the love jacklyn beset would get off and and

01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:14.640
robert wagner robert wagner and and urn is broken in and and and and tattoo

01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:19.840
would go who's that boss and mr. Rourke would say tattoo that is William

01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:27.240
salkind he wishes he could be a concert pianist there's three people getting off

01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:31.800
the plane but the resort was and then so what what happened to mr. salkind is

01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:35.440
he would end up being a concert pianist but he would also find out he didn't

01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:39.320
really want to be right yeah everyone would learn a lesson it was like they

01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:42.760
should have called a fucking oh henry island they should they should have

01:03:42.760 --> 01:03:47.280
called the better business bureau because but they were everyone was

01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:52.200
satisfied at the end I but at the end they were all like hey guess what mr.

01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:57.600
Rourke you pulled a fast one but I gotta admit you may realize I didn't want to

01:03:57.600 --> 01:04:01.520
be a concert pianist after all yeah so I'm not thinking about it then during the

01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:05.600
credits which you wouldn't see the mr. record pull up each aside and go thank

01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:11.840
you so much if you would be so kind as to tell no one about what goes on then

01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:16.080
no one will ever come here because no you may all be leaving and thinking oh

01:04:16.080 --> 01:04:23.160
thank you so much for showing me that my fantasy about being a gentleman in the

01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:28.680
1800s led to my misogyny and I had to solve it and all the shit but but no

01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:32.760
one's gonna come here for that right no one's coming to learn a lesson no one

01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:36.720
got their fantasy everyone got it right up nobody ever got what they wanted ever

01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:41.600
they got what they wanted and then some like they all walked away going huh I

01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:46.400
shouldn't have wanted that nobody said which is not what you get from Cheetos

01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:50.160
yes it is then there were things like there would be a thing like a like some

01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:53.960
little nerdy dude was like I want to be a big he-man or whatever I want to be like

01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:58.240
a cool guy and then he would discover that the coolness was within him the

01:04:58.240 --> 01:05:02.520
whole time right which means that yeah he had to clean the pool it's like when's

01:05:02.520 --> 01:05:05.720
my fantasy gonna start don't you understand when that guy picked on you

01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:14.360
you stood up to him what the fuck I gave you like five million dollars they

01:05:14.360 --> 01:05:18.600
never got into how much it had to cost to have your fantasy here's the other

01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:23.360
thing it had to be expensive it had to be so every establishing actors they're

01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:30.080
putting people in alien costumes prohibitively expensive Paul costumes

01:05:30.080 --> 01:05:36.440
mr. Rourke was magical well now hold on a second hold on a second in later

01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:43.240
seasons it was revealed that mr. Rourke had mysterious supernatural powers and

01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:49.560
we learned this when he had to do battle with the devil portrayed by portrayed

01:05:49.560 --> 01:05:54.600
by who's your number one pick to play Satan well Ricardo Montalbata in a

01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:58.280
split screen but that would be great I actually would have made a lot more

01:05:58.280 --> 01:06:04.080
sense but if you can't do that let's say Ricardo he's got terrible back pain

01:06:04.080 --> 01:06:09.080
it's all you can do this is actually true it's all you can do to shoot like

01:06:09.080 --> 01:06:15.960
just mr. Rourke's parts of course you go out to Roddy McDowell Roddy McDowell

01:06:15.960 --> 01:06:20.360
played Satan well that's good okay so you're you you're you know more about

01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:23.080
Fantasy Island than I do you're saying there I know good there was a casino

01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:28.760
Royale era of Fantasy Island that was pre super supernatural I think where they

01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:33.080
didn't yeah they did not acknowledge that he had powers it was just like all I

01:06:33.080 --> 01:06:37.760
remember is like two women that wanted to wanted to experience adventure or

01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:42.600
something and they woke up at dinosaur times and there were cavemen trying to

01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:47.760
like you know what you ravish them whatever the whatever the 80s term for

01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:52.440
it is and then mr. Rourke came out of the woods going oh but he was like

01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:56.520
prosthetically done up like a caveman and then he ripped off his mask but he

01:06:56.520 --> 01:06:59.480
was a he was mr. Rourke but it was like they were there were dinosaurs I

01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:05.480
remember anyways my question is this when they would show so they would cut

01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:08.120
their interstitials they would they would they would go like oh that

01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:11.560
person's fantasy is going on he's a concert pianist and that woman's in

01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:17.200
dinosaur times mr. Rourke and tattoo it be walking or somebody be walking

01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:23.880
like what an island and in the background there's all these

01:07:23.880 --> 01:07:28.480
people that aren't working there they're customers too they didn't get off the

01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:33.160
sea plane what package did they get like and how much of their fantasies are

01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:37.240
happening are they just getting anal beads like like like they don't get

01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:40.600
they don't get greeted by mr. Rourke that's like Captain Steuben's table maybe

01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:43.760
they got up maybe there's flights happening all day long we just get to see

01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:51.040
one or two you know like a week you know well tattoo does say Duplain

01:07:51.040 --> 01:08:01.280
he doesn't say one of Duplain yeah yeah another plane boss the 815 the 815 why

01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:06.400
is why is the briefing happening as the people are getting off the plane was

01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:10.400
like this one boss is like oh I guess I should have told you this why does

01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:23.240
tattoo have to know I put a folder in your room every morning I I don't even

01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:27.560
know I go through the trouble of boss trying to put these dots what about my

01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:35.320
fantasy tattoo illiteracy does not count as a fantasy you're just being lazy

01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:41.320
but my fantasy is you learn to read there was an episode where tattoo had to be a

01:08:41.320 --> 01:08:46.120
spaceman he had to be a little Martian and he had to put on green makeup and a

01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:52.560
bald cap and everything so it's it's it's very unclear as to how this whole

01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:56.440
operation works and I think that in the in the earlier before you know Satan

01:08:56.440 --> 01:09:00.960
shows up they they tried to I think the idea was it was just mysterious like how

01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:05.720
do you do this he's like I wouldn't you like to know and that was it's 9-11 it's

01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:13.840
9-11 yes it's Duplain all right Paul well what's happening Paul we we at

01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:20.000
Harmontown cheer when it's 9-11 on the clock it's it's a it's a rich history

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:31.240
I'm glad to see that people never forget to do that even a broken clock it's 9-11

01:09:31.240 --> 01:09:44.120
twice a day a broken clock remembers twice but five years from now when

01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:47.480
when McKenna and I do that because we want to write this pilot and it's just

01:09:47.480 --> 01:09:51.760
this is not gold bullion idea either but and I'm sure you've come up with it as

01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:57.840
well but like the ultimate workplace comedy is just like what yeah you work

01:09:57.840 --> 01:10:02.720
in Fantasy Island that's like yeah yeah this is like you're the house stealer

01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:07.480
they were clean the room and it's like what the fucking lizard skin and it's

01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:10.560
like what's going on you know it's like like some people getting drawn in and

01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:14.680
it's like like like you have to put on this wizard costume and what is that

01:10:14.680 --> 01:10:18.320
contract like like you must sign there's got to be so many things you're just

01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:25.840
signing away like look you a vampire might attack you yeah and I'm sorry but

01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:30.600
you either want to work here you don't I bet you find out if you talk to a

01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:34.640
worker at Fantasy Island long enough I bet you find out that they're like there

01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:41.760
there's like a tiny like dot like like right under their hairline and and like

01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:44.640
there's some weird microsurgery that's happened where they're like they've been

01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:49.000
lobotomized I bet you're right or or it's magic and they just forget when they

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:53.880
fly out of the fog of Fantasy Island but why does if when the supernatural thing

01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:56.920
can you imagine the Fantasy Island writers room because because because the

01:10:56.920 --> 01:11:01.440
you know the showrunner was like guys guys guys we've been over this the minute

01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:06.560
we jump that shark people are gonna ask why does Mr. Rourke need money like why

01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:11.520
is he why is he running a business I think if you ask if you if you like

01:11:11.520 --> 01:11:15.720
created a fantasy I'm right now and you said okay I'm hiring but it's it's do

01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:19.680
does anybody want to live on an island and role play all day long I like we've

01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:23.280
been to the Renaissance fair I think you could find people I bet there's ten

01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:28.720
people here who want to do that it's it's high stakes larping man people will

01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:33.840
be all all over that shit oh you got to be a concert piano teacher I I used to be

01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:37.280
a concert they would love it they'd freak out you gotta play an alien you

01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:41.640
gotta you got to get killed by a vampire be the best that'd be a great like kind

01:11:41.640 --> 01:11:47.360
of a murder mystery kind of evening where there was no you're just like one

01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:52.560
person has to be the pianist but I don't know I guess it just stops there

01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:58.400
there's like someone's just at the piano start just imagining I mean that

01:11:58.400 --> 01:12:02.400
point the show I'm so drunk it's not that's the only only the first 40 minutes

01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:08.120
of the show is usable like just like a like a like a role-playing event where

01:12:08.120 --> 01:12:11.360
you show up and you get a card but it says like oh I'm the I'm the piano player

01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:19.880
but like you just so that the good dead keep going I we're gonna support you

01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:25.200
all the way through this I don't know what my point is you know I always want

01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:29.960
to Aaron my ex-wife used to we used to have like she would have like these

01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:33.560
themed birthday parties like her parties like like we would try to get

01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:36.800
everybody together and try to like create our own things like that or she

01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:41.120
actually ordered some online and stuff like I would get really into those

01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:44.440
things there was one she did that was so complicated I still don't know what

01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:47.880
was happening get to break up in the groups do a painting remember that one

01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:53.920
where there was all there a jail in that one you get sent to jail I there was a

01:12:53.920 --> 01:13:00.960
Dan and Aaron shot a video a video I did throw don't yeah I tell you this is

01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:04.640
not me talking trash I I was paying attention I don't know what was going

01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:08.040
on at all and we were looking around like I don't did anybody catch that like

01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:12.320
we were freaking out like you because you didn't catch what the rules were or

01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:17.360
what the the gameplay was complicated I did is my recollection there was a

01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:20.760
lot happening there was arts and crafts and there was I think a murder and then

01:13:20.760 --> 01:13:26.760
some people go to Guantanamo Bay for a while like it was a space station the

01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:32.480
party was a space station and you you you were notified a couple weeks in

01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:38.360
advance like what species of alien you represented so they were like that was

01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:41.440
the cool part it was like I like that there are people that were like oh we're

01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:45.840
the garbage people and so they were like like like people made clothes on a

01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:49.600
garbage and blah blah blah you know you were one of a several different

01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:54.360
species and all stuff and but you know there were extra rules and stuff and

01:13:54.360 --> 01:14:01.240
whatever we have our own problems let's not you know if the what's the best case

01:14:01.240 --> 01:14:06.360
scenario of proving that Erin McGathy's birthday party was shitty are you

01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:13.120
asking me no I know okay I'm not I'm not prepared to answer that

01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:18.800
it was sure there were too many rules too many power crystals and things oh

01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:22.320
yeah there was marbles and crystals they had to find people were drunk and

01:14:22.320 --> 01:14:25.360
so they were just like what's going on I don't know yeah and then you just wonder

01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:29.560
I hid in the basement there with that was the prison yeah but you hid well you

01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:32.600
know I mean I wasn't hiding cuz if you did something wrong you had to go to the

01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:37.480
prison anyways I just stayed in the prison yeah I'm the earlier I think the

01:14:37.480 --> 01:14:40.560
year before that there was the murder mystery that the 20s gangster thing and

01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:45.220
I got killed like right off the bat and so I just I got I died upstairs in a

01:14:45.220 --> 01:14:49.360
room that nobody came in for like an hour and a half so I'm like I'm gonna lay

01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:55.640
face down for as long as it takes and I like I was underneath the coffee table in

01:14:55.640 --> 01:14:59.240
a way that there was no way you could possibly landed there like I'm like

01:14:59.240 --> 01:15:04.320
you couldn't have landed like that was that just to make a better picture just

01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:06.880
make it like people go cheese that guy died and it was complicated we don't we

01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:10.640
don't know what happened but then I'm like okay now I'm face down and I'm just

01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:15.320
I'm in a pile of dog hair for ever for the rest of my life and then it became

01:15:15.320 --> 01:15:19.360
like a challenge like I'm not gonna find that I'm not gonna I'm gonna stay here

01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:24.680
forever I long was it before people discovered you and maybe 40 minutes

01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:29.160
oh god that's too long it felt like an hour and a half so it's a murder mystery

01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:34.560
where they don't discover the murder well people kept dying all over the place

01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:37.680
I was nearly I think I was one of the people that died but I died right off

01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:41.120
the bat somebody came up and hand me a card you're dead and you're not allowed

01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:44.160
to say anything you're supposed to be dead on the spot right so I was like okay

01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:48.000
so I laid on the ground then I realized nobody was looking for me I was up I

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:55.360
was in the attic what were you doing up there I was supposed to go up there for

01:15:55.360 --> 01:15:58.920
some reason it was I was I was on a mission to go to talk to somebody or do

01:15:58.920 --> 01:16:03.600
a thing and it turns out I was on a mission for murder right but I want to

01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:07.440

focus on economics in Schumpeter specifically until I became a single man

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:44.360

bachelor is it things like eating the peanut butter directly out of the jaw

01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:10.480
so as to save money on washing dishes it goes further than that you have to

01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:14.560
understand if the peanut butter is crunchy directly out of the jaw simply

01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:20.920

01:25:55.200 --> 01:26:00.320
very imaginative for someone coming up with them right on the fly like this

01:26:00.320 --> 01:26:08.760
very colorful I will agree and you sir the name is Spoonerson sounds like

01:26:08.760 --> 01:26:15.480
someone got tired of making up names as they went from one side of the stage to

01:26:15.480 --> 01:26:21.240
the other got so caught up making up the name that they just threw in your

01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:29.080
occupation at the end which was explorer right oh god the lights went out turn

01:26:29.080 --> 01:26:39.480
off the lights the lights are still on the lights are still on I can see

01:26:39.480 --> 01:26:53.880
everything it's happening I can still kind of see everything

01:26:53.880 --> 01:27:01.840
the lights are gradually going out I am growing ever more terrified everybody

01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:07.840
just close your eyes close your eyes except for that one camera phone the

01:27:07.840 --> 01:27:14.920
lights have gone out I can tell you as a bachelor sometimes your lights go out

01:27:14.920 --> 01:27:19.560
when you least expected you thought you paid the bill and you skip them on more

01:27:19.560 --> 01:27:36.040
of these bad you look like lights lights I found the circuit breaker I found it

01:27:36.040 --> 01:27:45.280
well I think I know who did it a horse riding a motorcycle

01:27:45.280 --> 01:27:50.880
hold on one second there was a there was a chainsaw in there too so they may well

01:27:50.880 --> 01:27:56.640
have been in a car oh it's a chainsaw I do apologize I'm unaccustomed to such

01:27:56.640 --> 01:28:03.240
much yes you're on my travels oh the body seems to have horse prints and

01:28:03.240 --> 01:28:09.960
gunshot and chainsaw marks all over I say what a dreadful thing of course

01:28:09.960 --> 01:28:15.240
the constabulary is held up by the storm so we'll have to stay here until

01:28:15.240 --> 01:28:18.800
they show up how does that horse get away in that motorcycle of the storm is so

01:28:18.800 --> 01:28:23.400
bad well I would I would hazard a guess that it was a liposonic stallions among

01:28:23.400 --> 01:28:27.240
the smartest next to the Arabians not only can they hold a man but they can

01:28:27.240 --> 01:28:32.440
ride a chainsaw very sensible why would the storm be holding up the police or

01:28:32.440 --> 01:28:36.600
they ain't squad cause made of sugar sir

01:28:36.600 --> 01:28:45.360
oh ma'am I would suggest you take a look at a movie called the Shining

01:28:45.360 --> 01:28:54.320
um well one thing for certain the measure it is very cool oh there's such

01:28:54.320 --> 01:29:00.640
good news Scotland Yard is here Detective Steve Levy how did he get into the

01:29:00.640 --> 01:29:07.760
storm he gave was here already patrolling the barn what detective Steve

01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:11.160
Levy

01:29:11.160 --> 01:29:20.440
it's spandex detective I can tell by your stance and posture you are a lonely man

01:29:20.760 --> 01:29:27.920
goddamn so on the degree it's pretty good inspector I beg of you to solve this

01:29:27.920 --> 01:29:32.400
murder quickly this puts me in mind when my own dear husband was murdered you

01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:37.200
say that you are already have a murdered spouse with a cast of the light of

01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:41.400
suspicion on you right away one one one murdered spouse does not a murderous

01:29:41.400 --> 01:29:54.360
make sir what is this the staircase my husband was murdered by an owl under

01:29:54.360 --> 01:29:59.800
what circumstances he was at the top of the stairs arguing with an owl things

01:29:59.800 --> 01:30:19.480
got heated well this is an active this is an active crime scene I think everyone

01:30:19.480 --> 01:30:23.920
should clear out what we'll put around the yellow police tape and draw that

01:30:23.920 --> 01:30:28.600
outline of the body well my goodness we'll bring in the crew clean up we're

01:30:28.600 --> 01:30:32.400
dealing with dignified company here so do you need us to leave the room while

01:30:32.400 --> 01:30:39.280
you do all this well maybe maybe you should stay and help me now this seems

01:30:39.280 --> 01:30:47.360
highly a regular suspect in the murder investigation have to do the busy work

01:30:47.360 --> 01:30:53.320
of sealing the crime scene it seems counter to your purposes if you don't

01:30:53.320 --> 01:31:05.040
mind my saying so I am just a woman from the south well one thing is for

01:31:05.040 --> 01:31:09.680
certain sir if it would be all right with the constabulary I believe the

01:31:09.680 --> 01:31:15.480
deceased corpse should be removed from the anti-chamber into the oh I wasn't

01:31:15.480 --> 01:31:20.280
saying that you had to sit down for a moment that I thought I saw a scene like it

01:31:20.280 --> 01:31:32.440
okay Marissa has the corpse everybody it will take it will take two people who

01:31:32.440 --> 01:31:43.400
will split off into a different scene to move her body into the ice box

01:31:43.400 --> 01:31:49.760
well this is a grizzly affair but seeing as how I'm a soldier and been accustomed

01:31:49.760 --> 01:31:55.000
to being around bloody scenes before I'll lend a hand I suppose do we have

01:31:55.000 --> 01:32:01.840
another volunteer are we all British now I might be willing to volunteer to

01:32:01.840 --> 01:32:09.680
assist this rascallion what say you shall we I don't see any reason for you

01:32:09.680 --> 01:32:14.360
to have such anger towards me sir well but the deed must be done so let's go

01:32:14.360 --> 01:32:19.200
together let's take a heave-ho lend a hand clap to that slab line and hoist away

01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:23.920
on the other on the mission should we check with the police yeah this is highly

01:32:23.920 --> 01:32:31.680
suspicious well this is a crime scene we need to investigate well I didn't eat

01:32:31.680 --> 01:32:35.520
mr. hostess and there's an account very wisely said we should put the body into

01:32:35.520 --> 01:32:41.760
the ice box I mean that's suspicious this is a fair yes mr. hostess and why

01:32:41.760 --> 01:32:46.040
should we move the body away from the crime and why the ice box I mean you

01:32:46.040 --> 01:32:53.040
don't know whose house is this and why and why are we all here for pity's sake

01:32:53.040 --> 01:32:57.320
we never that was never really made clear the invitation why these four

01:32:57.320 --> 01:33:02.120
different people are asked to your home I just received a serious invitation that

01:33:02.120 --> 01:33:09.200
is correct to come to this mansion you won't regret it well it won't satisfy

01:33:09.200 --> 01:33:13.840
you further to know that I received a similar invitation which simply added be

01:33:13.840 --> 01:33:16.400
the butler

01:33:19.760 --> 01:33:26.400
sir do you mean to say you are not a proper butler my words take I take much

01:33:26.400 --> 01:33:33.520
umbridge at your tongue wagging I do you as you're a colonist but I am from

01:33:33.520 --> 01:33:38.640
three generations of man's servants so please don't leave me if I may pull you

01:33:38.640 --> 01:33:41.520
aside for a moment sergeant maybe yes let me pull you aside from it seems to

01:33:41.520 --> 01:33:44.400
me that the main suspect here must be the host of this party that's never

01:33:44.400 --> 01:33:49.120
shown himself and invited to a strange room and that of the strangers of a

01:33:49.120 --> 01:33:53.320
murder who is this host that sent out these invitations I think he is your

01:33:53.320 --> 01:34:02.000
suspect yeah well I you're accusatory I don't know anything about anyone here I

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:06.000
just I just arrived there's a body

01:34:08.160 --> 01:34:14.960
insane you're all a bunch of characters you seem to you seem to be well

01:34:14.960 --> 01:34:19.840
developed characters I would say sorry very well develop well maybe you heard

01:34:19.840 --> 01:34:28.480
my husband got murdered sometime ago by an owl she says an owl indeed well I'll

01:34:28.480 --> 01:34:34.360
tell you one thing my wife disappeared in much the same manner as a death by the

01:34:34.360 --> 01:34:42.120
hands of a man a man took her away with wily-wiles

01:34:42.320 --> 01:34:46.360
we let the scent in my house that could only be described as cologne I know it

01:34:46.360 --> 01:34:49.120
because I wear it as such to try to procure another lady are you accusing

01:34:49.120 --> 01:34:53.400
me of some if you have an accusation to make so I'll never sell that I've sent

01:34:53.400 --> 01:34:59.520
before until tonight what from that side yes it's true I did run away with her

01:34:59.520 --> 01:35:02.520
wife but I was not responsible for disappearance she left tonight I was as

01:35:02.520 --> 01:35:16.560
much shocked as anybody she hates horses well I suppose not having done any of

01:35:16.560 --> 01:35:24.920
these that it's time to pick who's the killer Mr. Hostesson Mr. Hostesson if I

01:35:24.920 --> 01:35:34.400
may this one of these situations where Mr. Hostesson if I may I there's

01:35:34.400 --> 01:35:40.320
someone has been conspicuously silent during all this I agree yeah I agree

01:35:40.320 --> 01:35:44.480
fellow let's explore that sir first of all I will forgive you not remove your

01:35:44.480 --> 01:35:49.920
pith helmet in the presence of a lady but why are you so strangely silent sir

01:35:49.920 --> 01:35:54.560
they have been a murder because there's two things I know one thing is that I'm

01:35:54.560 --> 01:36:02.200
an explorer and two things are that ass master embezzled butt munch at some

01:36:02.200 --> 01:36:07.520
point it's a plot point and that might be relevant to this whole scenario we

01:36:07.520 --> 01:36:14.640
found ourselves in because otherwise why would I know that my goodness what a

01:36:14.640 --> 01:36:22.440
cat's cradle of well-crafted character it's as if some master story teller of

01:36:22.440 --> 01:36:28.160
the top of his head whoa the spider's web of delight indeed let me ask a

01:36:28.160 --> 01:36:33.320
question of these two gentlemen did you know the deceased lady Mrs. Florence

01:36:33.320 --> 01:36:40.960
of course we all knew Mrs. Florence she was the biggest the biggest socialite

01:36:40.960 --> 01:36:46.520
nesics gardens she was the lady of the Florentine gardens not not the same

01:36:46.520 --> 01:36:50.280
lady Florentine lady Florentine oh my word I had no idea I was in the presence

01:36:50.280 --> 01:36:56.320
of a saloon you pretend to not know who lady Florentine is well I perhaps it's

01:36:56.320 --> 01:37:15.080
Southern modesty I found a trap door let's all go down my goodness the

01:37:15.080 --> 01:37:22.840
murder weapon this must be it's covered in blood and horse hair it's a standard

01:37:22.840 --> 01:37:33.040
issue horse knife very wide-handled to attach to a horseshoe but only one

01:37:33.040 --> 01:37:38.280
person can lift this much weight

01:37:38.280 --> 01:37:52.600
well the hostess and of the family host son of host gilded craftsman in the art

01:37:52.600 --> 01:37:59.320
of hospitality is it not true that you are a domestic surfer and that you must

01:37:59.320 --> 01:38:04.440
be skilled in the carrying of all things domestic and otherwise in a household

01:38:04.440 --> 01:38:10.280
should something happen either economic problem you would be the only one in

01:38:10.280 --> 01:38:15.800
this house that has access to the horse stables well you are true after a

01:38:15.800 --> 01:38:20.240
fashion my friends however

01:38:20.240 --> 01:38:36.000
you don't know is I have a horrible skin disease and keep peeling layers of my

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:40.160
face off are you the I use the actual master of this home I use the I use the

01:38:40.160 --> 01:38:46.880
owner I'm just horribly deformed oh put it back that doesn't mean you can't

01:38:46.880 --> 01:38:53.120
lift the I can't put it back on that's so effective peeling his own skin off

01:38:53.120 --> 01:38:57.880
like that scene from poltergeist well what would you have me do live and not

01:38:57.880 --> 01:39:04.120
do that don't do it it's unpleasant sir unpleasant I would expect nothing less

01:39:04.120 --> 01:39:15.880
of all of you Ricardo Montabon that's right it's my house and I invited all

01:39:15.880 --> 01:39:21.360
of you here because well each of you should know why one way or another

01:39:21.360 --> 01:39:26.240
you've all done something wrong to me I think

01:39:27.360 --> 01:39:34.240
Colonel ass master yes you've done a lot of wrong things to a lot of people did

01:39:34.240 --> 01:39:41.160
you not once tell me that you would rather see me dead and this is falling

01:39:41.160 --> 01:39:55.640
apart oh just now yes yes after a few glasses of port wine I did say as much

01:39:55.640 --> 01:39:58.400
because you and Lady Florentine have been cheating around behind my back it's

01:39:58.400 --> 01:40:01.600
quite well known that I had been dating Lady Florentine behind my wife's back

01:40:01.600 --> 01:40:09.280
for many many months I found another trap door but only I'm going down it

01:40:09.280 --> 01:40:24.800
yeah look at him go he's he's clearly the murderer right secret tunnels miles

01:40:24.800 --> 01:40:34.000
of them must be some kind of destination well gentlemen I feel like we've

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:38.920
learned a valuable lesson here tonight some actual is eat peanut butter

01:40:38.920 --> 01:40:44.560
straight out of the can others build tunnels and riddles no nobody chased to

01:40:44.560 --> 01:40:52.080
me I mean it seemed like someone's obvious job to chase you but I don't

01:40:52.080 --> 01:40:57.760
want to point any fingers everyone look look what Sergeant Leafy's been killed

01:40:57.760 --> 01:41:02.640
oh that's why well that distraction was happening Sergeant Leafy's laying dead

01:41:02.640 --> 01:41:09.960
in the floor with it with a with a letter opener stabbed in the back of his

01:41:09.960 --> 01:41:19.720
face there's no light down here I can't I ran for miles and I can't I guess I

01:41:19.720 --> 01:41:22.960
could go back the other way but I've turned around so many times I can't tell

01:41:22.960 --> 01:41:31.040
which way I'm going now I'll walk this way for 20 seconds and if I don't

01:41:31.040 --> 01:41:38.880
encounter anything I'll put a mark in the floor like a divot that I can feel

01:41:42.400 --> 01:41:46.760
did you five years later

01:41:46.760 --> 01:42:00.600
happy birthday to you well professor I can't believe it's our fifth year here

01:42:00.600 --> 01:42:07.960
it's man shit still look the murders have gone unsolved I think we know who

01:42:07.960 --> 01:42:14.400
did it seems like it's an open and shut case my family must be worried about me

01:42:14.400 --> 01:42:19.400
at this point in a way though Colonel I feel as if we become our own little

01:42:19.400 --> 01:42:27.560
family in this mansion say hi to my wife if you happen to leave I found oh snap

01:42:27.560 --> 01:42:35.520
that's that sounded like a burn but I'm not sure who got burnt my wife if you

01:42:35.520 --> 01:42:49.400
happen to leave I will okay sure thing I can hear seagulls I'm going to make my

01:42:49.400 --> 01:42:57.080
way towards the sound hopefully this will be my last diary entry hopefully

01:42:57.080 --> 01:43:19.400
because I've published these tomes a rocky shore has it been so long since

01:43:19.400 --> 01:43:27.360
I've seen the light this elaborate labyrinth of caverns and passages must

01:43:27.360 --> 01:43:34.800
have gone all the way under the natural limestone of Murder Island but why

01:43:34.800 --> 01:43:49.320
terminate here why put a door at the sheer cliff the sound mocks me I did

01:43:49.320 --> 01:44:01.400
a bad job hosting that murder mystery the jagged rocks invite me to my

01:44:01.400 --> 01:44:29.280
recompense it's what I deserve I think I've come to terms with the loss of my

01:44:29.280 --> 01:44:34.400
wife now there's so many years to meditate on it I feel much the same

01:44:34.400 --> 01:44:38.520
professor I feel as if I'm finally ready to move on as the boat as the boat

01:44:38.520 --> 01:44:42.440
turns and heaves to towards the winds turn away that you see the the stern of

01:44:42.440 --> 01:44:51.840
the of the boat come into view and it says HMS I did it so ass master was the

01:44:51.840 --> 01:45:01.840
murderer as for my death none will question its cause its murderer was

01:45:01.840 --> 01:45:15.000
lack of preparation camera pans up and you see seagulls fly into the sky did I

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:25.760
turn into one of them or was it just a ratings board thing we don't know that

01:45:25.760 --> 01:45:33.920
that was a really good murder mystery night you guys did a pretty good job I

01:45:33.920 --> 01:45:40.120
think that was a solid effort now imagine what we could do with a couple hours of

01:45:40.120 --> 01:45:46.040
preparation oh yeah definitely someone should transcribe that I think with a

01:45:46.040 --> 01:45:52.600
few tweets we got a pretty good script I knew that you're supposed to tell some

01:45:52.600 --> 01:45:57.400
people that they there's something about someone else but I I think I I don't I

01:45:57.400 --> 01:46:00.760
didn't realize it's supposed to all lead back to you just told me your name is

01:46:00.760 --> 01:46:10.600
Colonel ass master and you did it that's all I got and then I said your

01:46:10.600 --> 01:46:15.280
professor but much and you're he stole your wife and then I said you're a

01:46:15.280 --> 01:46:21.160
southern bell and my husband was murdered right separate thing and I said

01:46:21.160 --> 01:46:30.600
you're the butler no way your name is Spuh-spuh-spuh-spuh... minutes later. Spoonerman no

01:46:30.600 --> 01:46:35.960
way you're the explorer right because I realized I should be the butler and then

01:46:35.960 --> 01:46:42.520
you walk over there a mess without a host yeah and then leave me I didn't tell

01:46:42.520 --> 01:46:47.080
anything you get what you gave me the most complicated of all of those well I

01:46:47.080 --> 01:46:52.000
told you after a while I said yeah you were dating Beauregard and that you

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:55.480
guys wanted and you weren't even in on it I was like what the fuck's going on not

01:46:55.480 --> 01:46:59.920
at all and not only that the plot thickens that we're trying to rob the

01:46:59.920 --> 01:47:03.960
house oh yeah I should have told you I should have told you should have told

01:47:03.960 --> 01:47:16.120
him I should have told you that that was a real dead end for me it wasn't the

01:47:16.120 --> 01:47:22.800
perfect crime all right well but like like you say that that was just you

01:47:22.800 --> 01:47:27.480
freestyling man that was a that was like that was the equivalent of your

01:47:27.480 --> 01:47:32.320
freestyle raps yeah that was like yeah you're saying it's time to time to end

01:47:32.320 --> 01:47:38.560
the show and what have we learned what have we learned tonight we learned that

01:47:38.560 --> 01:47:45.240
Paul's married it's true it doesn't have kids that he has a show on a seesaw

01:47:45.240 --> 01:47:54.360
called Pajillion Dollar I was gonna say Pajillion Dollar Mysteries created by

01:47:54.360 --> 01:47:59.280
Coolop that's right cool if you lie suck good job saying her last name I wasn't

01:47:59.280 --> 01:48:06.400

01:48:06.400 --> 01:48:12.000
just like I'm saying Johnson our friend Coolop created it it is supposedly

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:18.840
pretty good I'm biased but I think it's very fun it's like it's like an homage

01:48:18.840 --> 01:48:24.480
to the to the to the treasure chest that is these unscripted realtor shows yes

01:48:24.480 --> 01:48:29.000
which are all insane I've seen some of them they are all insane they're filled

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:35.960
with monstrous people and your character's name is Dean Rose Dragon

01:48:35.960 --> 01:48:42.800
it's like the patriarch of the realtor we learned that DeMorge still really took

01:48:42.800 --> 01:48:47.440
it to heart when we said that turtleneck was sexy last last time because I wore

01:48:47.440 --> 01:48:56.720
twice sorry that's bullying I'm bullying we learned that Steve has to do

01:48:56.720 --> 01:49:08.960
everything I say we learned that Spencer's I'm gonna explore Jeff still

01:49:08.960 --> 01:49:17.720

01:49:26.640 --> 01:49:31.320

01:49:31.320 --> 01:49:39.360
down locked in place you have to go to a cabinet get a key slay a three-headed dog
