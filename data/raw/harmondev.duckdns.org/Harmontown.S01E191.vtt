{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:10.000\nOh yeah. This musical theme is created by Jordy White from Marilyn Manson's fame.\n\n00:10.000 --> 00:17.000\nWho is joining us next week at Fred Sablon because a new show on Feral audio, Hour of Goon, is also airing.\n\n00:17.000 --> 00:24.000\nSo Jordy's made us a lot of music, so get ready for a lot of groovy, spooky rock from Jordy White.\n\n00:24.000 --> 00:32.000\nI think there's lyrics at some point too. Let's bring our special critter in everybody.\n\n00:44.000 --> 00:47.000\nThe Mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.\n\n00:47.000 --> 00:49.000\nThank you very much.\n\n01:00.000 --> 01:03.000\nYeah, did you explain that?\n\n01:03.000 --> 01:04.000\nI did. I shot it at that.\n\n01:04.000 --> 01:08.000\nAlright. I was getting all ready to explain the Marilyn Manson guy.\n\n01:08.000 --> 01:09.000\nYeah.\n\n01:09.000 --> 01:11.000\nNow how am I going to start the show?\n\n01:11.000 --> 01:13.000\nTake a swing at it.\n\n01:13.000 --> 01:19.000\nThis guy from Marilyn Manson made music.\n\n01:19.000 --> 01:22.000\nHe's going to be on the show in a couple of weeks.\n\n01:22.000 --> 01:26.000\nThat guy likes Star Wars and comic books more than anybody in this room.\n\n01:26.000 --> 01:30.000\nHe is the biggest sci-fi geek in the universe. It's great.\n\n01:30.000 --> 01:37.000\nI got Star Wars on my Apple TV. I watched Hateful Eight instead.\n\n01:37.000 --> 01:44.000\nI can't believe. I'm kind of proud and ashamed of it at the same time.\n\n01:44.000 --> 01:48.000\nEvery time I open up the thing, I'm like, I'm going to watch a movie and then I see the other new Star Wars.\n\n01:48.000 --> 01:51.000\nI'm like, I'll just watch it some other time.\n\n01:51.000 --> 01:57.000\nIt's not a clip of Han Solo wanting to use the crossbow.\n\n01:57.000 --> 02:00.000\nAnd then he's like, I like it.\n\n02:00.000 --> 02:04.000\nI can extrapolate what that movie is going to be.\n\n02:04.000 --> 02:08.000\nIt's not for me, right? It's not for me.\n\n02:08.000 --> 02:12.000\nYeah, I think I mentioned that I fell asleep in a theater, then fell asleep in my dream.\n\n02:12.000 --> 02:14.000\nWe're old, you know?\n\n02:14.000 --> 02:16.000\nWe're old.\n\n02:16.000 --> 02:19.000\nIs it for young people? Spencer, did you watch it?\n\n02:19.000 --> 02:20.000\nDid you dig the new one?\n\n02:20.000 --> 02:22.000\nI never got into Star Wars, man.\n\n02:22.000 --> 02:27.000\nI saw it like a couple of times as a kid, but then any time I'd seen any part of it since then,\n\n02:27.000 --> 02:32.000\nI was like, what the fuck? Is this Darth Vader? He's in this one too?\n\n02:32.000 --> 02:36.000\nIt's just really crazy to me. So it's just the same thing.\n\n02:36.000 --> 02:40.000\nI'm excited about the fact that what they're doing industrially speaking,\n\n02:40.000 --> 02:45.000\nI think they might as well break that thing open and do what they're doing in a post-Marvel world.\n\n02:45.000 --> 02:49.000\nLet's watch a million Star Wars movies. I don't mind that.\n\n02:49.000 --> 02:53.000\nBecause they're taking, you know, they're just throwing everything at the wall.\n\n02:53.000 --> 02:56.000\nAnd so some of that shit's going to be good.\n\n02:56.000 --> 03:00.000\nAll different writers and directors and stuff. It's going to be fun.\n\n03:00.000 --> 03:03.000\nIt's not a secret, right? The Legos guys are doing the Han Solo thing.\n\n03:03.000 --> 03:05.000\nThat's all announced and stuff.\n\n03:05.000 --> 03:10.000\nAnd Adam Driver's playing Han Solo? Am I getting any of this right or am I just old?\n\n03:10.000 --> 03:13.000\nI don't know. I could have this all wrong.\n\n03:13.000 --> 03:18.000\nThey're like, no, Adam Driver is playing. Never mind.\n\n03:18.000 --> 03:24.000\nAdam Arkin is driving them to the lot.\n\n03:24.000 --> 03:30.000\nYeah, I'm getting ready to, you know, I'm just banking stuff for, you know,\n\n03:30.000 --> 03:33.000\nI'm just trying to put together a nest egg for my retirement now.\n\n03:33.000 --> 03:37.000\nAnd I don't need to take in any more pop culture. I'm not going to be relevant.\n\n03:37.000 --> 03:41.000\nTen years from now when this stuff's going to be funny to reference, you know,\n\n03:41.000 --> 03:47.000\nlike when I was 35, you'd bust out a Goonies joke and people would be like,\n\n03:47.000 --> 03:56.000\nso the equivalent of that right now for this stuff, I'd be like 70 going like, remember the remake of the remake of the remake of the Goonies?\n\n03:56.000 --> 04:01.000\nAnd people would be like, go to bed, old man.\n\n04:01.000 --> 04:06.000\nDo you have an ideal retirement age? Do you think you want to retire at some point?\n\n04:06.000 --> 04:11.000\n42. I am currently a year behind schedule.\n\n04:11.000 --> 04:18.000\nI spent the day retired. I didn't have to shoot. I was supposed to be writing my book for a double day,\n\n04:18.000 --> 04:25.000\nbut instead I've really, I really was a bad boy today.\n\n04:25.000 --> 04:28.000\nLike a girlfriend's out of town.\n\n04:28.000 --> 04:31.000\nAnd so it was literally like, you heard my voice last week.\n\n04:31.000 --> 04:36.000\nLike I've been, I've not been outside of anyone's company for like months.\n\n04:36.000 --> 04:43.000\nAnd like, I just sort of, I just vegged out today and I kept opening up my computer and going,\n\n04:43.000 --> 04:45.000\nokay, I'm going to start writing.\n\n04:45.000 --> 04:56.000\nBut then like, I took like bullshit time wasting video gaming to a new level today\n\n04:56.000 --> 04:58.000\nand just actually made some interesting discoveries.\n\n04:58.000 --> 05:06.000\nLike I've been playing this game called Avengers Academy on the iPad.\n\n05:06.000 --> 05:16.000\nIt's like a game for and by 13 year old girls set in the Marvel universe in which all the Marvel characters are going to prep school.\n\n05:16.000 --> 05:21.000\nAnd you press on WASP and she says like, want to take a selfie?\n\n05:21.000 --> 05:24.000\nAnd then she takes a selfie for a while.\n\n05:24.000 --> 05:29.000\nAnd then like, you can make her take selfies faster if you buy enough crystals or,\n\n05:29.000 --> 05:32.000\nbut like, you know, you're not going to pay any money, right?\n\n05:32.000 --> 05:33.000\nYou're going to beat the game.\n\n05:33.000 --> 05:41.000\nAnd so I've been on this thing for a while and now they've got the Guardians of the Galaxy event happening this weekend or all through April.\n\n05:41.000 --> 05:44.000\nSo there's like, you can unlock Guardians of the Galaxy.\n\n05:44.000 --> 05:49.000\nThey crashed outside the campus and you're just, it's just a farming game.\n\n05:49.000 --> 05:57.000\nIt's getting really scary how much of a science they've gotten like our just dopamine spiking to things.\n\n05:57.000 --> 06:03.000\nSo you can see the effect it has had on me.\n\n06:03.000 --> 06:07.000\nI'm not as put together as I usually am.\n\n06:07.000 --> 06:09.000\nBut there was a game I found.\n\n06:09.000 --> 06:11.000\nIt's called Adventure Capitalist.\n\n06:11.000 --> 06:16.000\nIt's by this, the company's called Congregate with a K.\n\n06:16.000 --> 06:19.000\nI'm actually, I'm recommending, you should check it out.\n\n06:19.000 --> 06:22.000\nLike, I don't, I'm not going to say everybody in the world's going to like it,\n\n06:22.000 --> 06:23.000\nbut it's insane.\n\n06:23.000 --> 06:25.000\nIt's insanely like minimalist.\n\n06:25.000 --> 06:34.000\nLike, it literally is like, you press a button to make your lemonade stand generate money.\n\n06:34.000 --> 06:37.000\nSo it's a progress indicator that goes whoop.\n\n06:37.000 --> 06:39.000\nAnd then your lemonade stand has made money.\n\n06:39.000 --> 06:41.000\nSo then you press it again.\n\n06:41.000 --> 06:46.000\nAnd it whoop, it did it again, whoop, and you keep doing it, and after a while if you keep doing it,\n\n06:46.000 --> 06:52.000\na button appears below it that says, well now you can buy a donut shop.\n\n06:52.000 --> 06:56.000\nMore money, progress indicator goes a little slow.\n\n06:56.000 --> 07:00.000\nAfter a while you get some more money and then it goes, hey, you tired of pressing those buttons?\n\n07:00.000 --> 07:02.000\nWhy don't you hire a manager?\n\n07:02.000 --> 07:04.000\nAnd you go to the thing.\n\n07:04.000 --> 07:06.000\nAnd you hire these managers.\n\n07:06.000 --> 07:09.000\nA lemonade manager, thousand bucks.\n\n07:09.000 --> 07:12.000\nAnd your lemonade is like, whoop, whoop, whoop, your lemonade is getting made.\n\n07:12.000 --> 07:14.000\nAnd you orgasm when that happens.\n\n07:14.000 --> 07:15.000\nThey trick you.\n\n07:15.000 --> 07:20.000\nYou're going like, oh my God, it's making lemonade whether I touch it or not.\n\n07:20.000 --> 07:22.000\nAnd then you do the same with the donuts.\n\n07:22.000 --> 07:25.000\nAnd it goes all the way, there's two rows on the iPad.\n\n07:25.000 --> 07:27.000\nIf it's portrait style, it's two rows.\n\n07:27.000 --> 07:30.000\nAnd the bottom row is just oil rigs and everything.\n\n07:30.000 --> 07:38.000\nAnd I've been playing it for two days straight because part of the game is once you get like into quadrillions of dollars,\n\n07:38.000 --> 07:45.000\nyou can start, you can restart, you accrue these angel investors.\n\n07:45.000 --> 07:55.000\nWhich means basically, all it means is that you can start the game over and you kind of like, it's like, everything costs different.\n\n07:55.000 --> 07:57.000\nBut it's, say, I'm so fucking addicted to it.\n\n07:57.000 --> 07:58.000\nThey've figured it out.\n\n07:58.000 --> 08:01.000\nLike, you don't need a Pac-Man eating dots even.\n\n08:01.000 --> 08:03.000\nWe're monkeys.\n\n08:03.000 --> 08:05.000\nWe'll just sit there and fucking.\n\n08:05.000 --> 08:08.000\nLike, I've got the thing running right now.\n\n08:08.000 --> 08:11.000\nI can't wait to get home.\n\n08:11.000 --> 08:13.000\nCan we fire it up and see where you're at right now?\n\n08:13.000 --> 08:14.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n08:14.000 --> 08:16.000\nI will run.\n\n08:16.000 --> 08:22.000\nWhat I want to do with my phone is I brought, so Avengers Academy, back to that.\n\n08:22.000 --> 08:24.000\nSo I'm playing Avengers Academy.\n\n08:24.000 --> 08:30.000\nAnd it's these kids, they're young adults and they've got will they won't they stories going on.\n\n08:30.000 --> 08:33.000\nAnd it's all family oriented.\n\n08:33.000 --> 08:46.000\nBut the Tony Stark character, of course, is supposed to be, he's supposed to be like the, you know, he's like the, for those of you who are my age, three of you, he's the Mahoney of this Academy.\n\n08:46.000 --> 08:47.000\nNope.\n\n08:47.000 --> 08:52.000\nNobody's, that was for me and you.\n\n08:52.000 --> 08:56.000\nSpencer's dad listening somewhere at home.\n\n08:56.000 --> 09:04.000\nOkay, but okay, so, so every time you touch these kids.\n\n09:04.000 --> 09:09.000\nAll right, that was for me, you and a couple people.\n\n09:09.000 --> 09:14.000\nNow I'm listening.\n\n09:14.000 --> 09:15.000\nGo on.\n\n09:15.000 --> 09:19.000\nEvery time you touch these kids, you get a dollar.\n\n09:19.000 --> 09:22.000\nAnd they get a piece of candy.\n\n09:22.000 --> 09:27.000\nYou touch enough kids, you get a van.\n\n09:27.000 --> 09:37.000\nBut it has windows in it, but you can remove them as you upgrade.\n\n09:37.000 --> 09:42.000\nYour cross-space needs more space.\n\n09:42.000 --> 09:48.000\nYou need a shovel sharpener.\n\n09:48.000 --> 09:52.000\nIt's to bury the kids you killed.\n\n09:52.000 --> 09:56.000\nYou sickos.\n\n09:56.000 --> 10:02.000\nOkay, but every time you touch one of these young folks, that made it better.\n\n10:02.000 --> 10:09.000\nEvery time you tap on one of them, you know, they just every time, every time you tap that.\n\n10:09.000 --> 10:11.000\nThey have a sound bite.\n\n10:11.000 --> 10:18.000\nLike I said, if you tap Wasp, she goes like, so fierce.\n\n10:18.000 --> 10:22.000\nThey have like 20 random things, so sometimes she'll go like, whatever happened to romance.\n\n10:22.000 --> 10:27.000\nLet's see, I think I have, I wanted to set the tone for you, so let's see.\n\n10:27.000 --> 10:30.000\nHere's a Wasp one.\n\n10:30.000 --> 10:33.000\nWait, oh shit, I gotta put it, okay.\n\n10:33.000 --> 10:36.000\nThis party started.\n\n10:36.000 --> 10:40.000\nLet's get this party started, Wasp says.\n\n10:40.000 --> 10:45.000\nYou know, it's just, in case you didn't know what a sound bite was.\n\n10:45.000 --> 10:47.000\nCan I hear a couple more?\n\n10:47.000 --> 10:49.000\nLoki is going to the Academy too.\n\n10:49.000 --> 10:51.000\nHe's kind of like, I know what you're saying, isn't he a bad guy?\n\n10:51.000 --> 10:57.000\nWell, that's the thing about you, when you're in school, it's like, front of me, you know?\n\n10:57.000 --> 11:01.000\nSo like, so like Red Skull will come in a leather jacket and he'll be like, what's up?\n\n11:01.000 --> 11:03.000\nYou know, it'd be like, get out of here.\n\n11:03.000 --> 11:10.000\nAnd I'll be like, okay, so here's some Loki sound bites or one Loki sound bite.\n\n11:10.000 --> 11:13.000\nI didn't take orders from you.\n\n11:13.000 --> 11:16.000\nSo that's just like, imagine these are just little bites.\n\n11:16.000 --> 11:18.000\nHe's the Gecko?\n\n11:18.000 --> 11:24.000\nSo over time, you're going to hear these things 5,000 times if you're really addicted to this game.\n\n11:24.000 --> 11:28.000\nAnd so the thing is about the Tony Stark character.\n\n11:28.000 --> 11:38.000\nNow, if the kid playing Tony Stark is a fan of the podcast, I hope he doesn't do anything untoward to himself.\n\n11:38.000 --> 11:42.000\nYou sound fine. You should be working in voiceover work.\n\n11:42.000 --> 11:48.000\nIt's just that your clips were poorly directed and poorly chosen for the game,\n\n11:48.000 --> 11:53.000\nbecause they're very, very long for considering that every time I tap on Tony Stark,\n\n11:53.000 --> 11:57.000\nwhich is going to be a lot because he's the best.\n\n11:57.000 --> 12:00.000\nAnd he makes everything.\n\n12:00.000 --> 12:06.000\nSo you have to hear these very long sound clips.\n\n12:06.000 --> 12:15.000\nSo I recorded a handful of Tony Stark's sound bites until I got to the one that really, really bothers me.\n\n12:15.000 --> 12:17.000\nAnd I think it's the last one.\n\n12:17.000 --> 12:19.000\nSo first, we'll just listen to a couple.\n\n12:19.000 --> 12:20.000\nI didn't take orders.\n\n12:20.000 --> 12:22.000\nOh, that's not...\n\n12:22.000 --> 12:27.000\nOh, could you imagine if that was Tony Stark?\n\n12:27.000 --> 12:31.000\nWhy did you bring me to this podcast?\n\n12:31.000 --> 12:35.000\nNo, I swear, Rob Corddry was here last week.\n\n12:35.000 --> 12:39.000\nHe's my favorite writer.\n\n12:39.000 --> 12:43.000\nSomeone's on a first date tonight.\n\n12:43.000 --> 12:46.000\nAnd I blew it for them.\n\n12:46.000 --> 12:51.000\nBut there's one other person who's on a first date and we're nailing it somehow.\n\n12:51.000 --> 12:52.000\nI don't know how.\n\n12:52.000 --> 12:53.000\nI don't know.\n\n12:53.000 --> 12:55.000\nMaybe the girl that brought the guy...\n\n12:55.000 --> 13:00.000\nThe guy is like, maybe he's like a big Avengers fan.\n\n13:00.000 --> 13:01.000\nAnd he's like, I didn't know...\n\n13:01.000 --> 13:06.000\nI didn't know you'd take me to see a fat guy play clips from the thing.\n\n13:06.000 --> 13:08.000\nAnd she's like, yeah, well, I know what I'm doing.\n\n13:08.000 --> 13:11.000\nAnd he's like, I'm going to make love to you tonight.\n\n13:11.000 --> 13:13.000\nAnd she's like...\n\n13:13.000 --> 13:18.000\nSee how I reverse those roles to give the woman agency?\n\n13:18.000 --> 13:26.000\nI was going to go see David Gilmore from Pink Floyd, but I'm so much happier that we came to see this.\n\n13:26.000 --> 13:27.000\nOh, the fat guy...\n\n13:27.000 --> 13:28.000\nYeah, it's okay.\n\n13:28.000 --> 13:29.000\nThe fat guy playing clips.\n\n13:29.000 --> 13:32.000\nThat's David Gilmore from Pink Floyd.\n\n13:32.000 --> 13:34.000\nNo, he's a very sexy guy from Pink Floyd, isn't he?\n\n13:34.000 --> 13:36.000\nGod, is he here?\n\n13:36.000 --> 13:38.000\nNo, I think he's playing tonight at the Forum or something.\n\n13:38.000 --> 13:39.000\nOh, okay.\n\n13:39.000 --> 13:41.000\nI was trying to figure out what dot you were connecting.\n\n13:41.000 --> 13:42.000\nI know.\n\n13:42.000 --> 13:43.000\nI'm just saying, you know...\n\n13:43.000 --> 13:44.000\nTonight's the dot.\n\n13:44.000 --> 13:49.000\nWe live in the entertainment capital of the world, there's a lot of choices for your entertainment dollar.\n\n13:49.000 --> 13:51.000\nDavid Gilmore from Pink Floyd is playing.\n\n13:51.000 --> 13:56.000\nI mean, even I would say better to come here.\n\n13:56.000 --> 13:57.000\nEven you?\n\n13:57.000 --> 13:58.000\nYeah.\n\n13:58.000 --> 14:04.000\nEven if Roger Waters isn't there, come here.\n\n14:04.000 --> 14:05.000\nWow.\n\n14:05.000 --> 14:06.000\nAll right.\n\n14:06.000 --> 14:07.000\nShots fired.\n\n14:07.000 --> 14:09.000\nAll right.\n\n14:09.000 --> 14:12.000\nSo here's some Tony Stark.\n\n14:12.000 --> 14:15.000\nLet's get serious or not.\n\n14:15.000 --> 14:16.000\nOkay.\n\n14:16.000 --> 14:17.000\nHe's funny.\n\n14:17.000 --> 14:18.000\nHe's the funny one.\n\n14:18.000 --> 14:20.000\nSo remember that one.\n\n14:20.000 --> 14:21.000\nHe's the funny one.\n\n14:21.000 --> 14:22.000\nRemember that one.\n\n14:22.000 --> 14:25.000\nLet's get serious or not.\n\n14:25.000 --> 14:26.000\nOkay.\n\n14:26.000 --> 14:29.000\nSo that one's going to come back to haunt you in a second.\n\n14:29.000 --> 14:31.000\nHere's some more.\n\n14:31.000 --> 14:33.000\nWe make a great team.\n\n14:33.000 --> 14:36.000\nI mean, I'm the boss, but still.\n\n14:36.000 --> 14:37.000\nOkay.\n\n14:37.000 --> 14:38.000\nOkay.\n\n14:38.000 --> 14:39.000\nAll right.\n\n14:39.000 --> 14:42.000\nTony, let's do a couple more longer, longer.\n\n14:42.000 --> 14:43.000\nLonger.\n\n14:43.000 --> 14:46.000\nRemember kids are going to have to listen to this 500 times.\n\n14:46.000 --> 14:47.000\nCan I give you one more note?\n\n14:47.000 --> 14:48.000\nWe do it again.\n\n14:48.000 --> 14:49.000\nCan you trail off towards the end?\n\n14:49.000 --> 14:50.000\nYeah.\n\n14:50.000 --> 14:52.000\nCan that lose energy kind of?\n\n14:52.000 --> 14:53.000\nYeah.\n\n14:53.000 --> 14:57.000\nThere's one that's not on here where he goes, you can tell that the kid like that's doing the voice.\n\n14:57.000 --> 15:02.000\nYou can tell that the director was like, I think, I think we're missing the, can you do it one more time?\n\n15:02.000 --> 15:08.000\nI don't think we're getting the word assistant because, because the catchphrase, maybe you could be my new assistant.\n\n15:08.000 --> 15:12.000\nAnd it's really weird.\n\n15:12.000 --> 15:13.000\nAll right.\n\n15:13.000 --> 15:14.000\nThere's more.\n\n15:14.000 --> 15:16.000\nThis has a payoff kind of.\n\n15:16.000 --> 15:18.000\nI'm a genius.\n\n15:18.000 --> 15:19.000\nYeah.\n\n15:19.000 --> 15:25.000\nHe just said, how does everyone feel about me making an army of robots?\n\n15:25.000 --> 15:26.000\nWhatever.\n\n15:26.000 --> 15:27.000\nI mean, we feel great.\n\n15:27.000 --> 15:28.000\nLike do it.\n\n15:28.000 --> 15:32.000\nLike it's not a catchphrase.\n\n15:32.000 --> 15:38.000\nDo you think villains know that they don't have a chance or do they just not get it?\n\n15:38.000 --> 15:40.000\nThis is like nails on a chalkboard.\n\n15:40.000 --> 15:41.000\nI don't like it.\n\n15:41.000 --> 15:42.000\nOkay.\n\n15:42.000 --> 15:44.000\nI think this next one might be, let me, oh boy.\n\n15:44.000 --> 15:45.000\nOkay.\n\n15:45.000 --> 15:48.000\nI'm taking a half day.\n\n15:48.000 --> 15:49.000\nYeah.\n\n15:49.000 --> 15:50.000\nThat one's fine.\n\n15:50.000 --> 15:51.000\nThat's short.\n\n15:51.000 --> 15:52.000\nLet's get serious.\n\n15:52.000 --> 15:53.000\nOkay.\n\n15:53.000 --> 15:55.000\nSo here we go.\n\n15:55.000 --> 15:59.000\nSo two of them, two of them start with let's get serious.\n\n15:59.000 --> 16:04.000\nSo you remember the first one starts with a middle, down the third baseline, let's get\n\n16:04.000 --> 16:06.000\nserious or not.\n\n16:06.000 --> 16:08.000\nYou know, it's fine.\n\n16:08.000 --> 16:09.000\nIs he growing up?\n\n16:09.000 --> 16:10.000\nIs he growing through puberty?\n\n16:10.000 --> 16:11.000\nNo, no.\n\n16:11.000 --> 16:14.440\nThis one sounds like he's just clipping the mic and he's just enraged at first.\n\n16:14.440 --> 16:19.120\nBut now, listen, don't react like after let's get serious.\n\n16:19.120 --> 16:20.960\nListen to the tag on this one.\n\n16:20.960 --> 16:25.920\nSo it's a different, like why they would include two let's get serious ones, I don't know.\n\n16:25.920 --> 16:29.120\nBut this one is the worst.\n\n16:29.120 --> 16:32.680\nThis is the worst, like it's not the worst Avenger Academy catchphrase.\n\n16:32.680 --> 16:38.080\nIt's not the worst thing that, this is the worst thing ever.\n\n16:38.080 --> 16:40.760\nAnd every, there's like a, there's like a one in 20 chance.\n\n16:40.760 --> 16:43.640\nYou hear this every time you tap on Tony Stark.\n\n16:43.640 --> 16:44.640\nOkay.\n\n16:44.640 --> 16:47.600\nSo again, don't react after he says let's get serious.\n\n16:47.600 --> 16:49.120\nWait for it.\n\n16:49.120 --> 16:54.120\nWait for the amazing punchline.\n\n16:54.120 --> 17:09.680\nLet's get serious is what people tell me all the time.\n\n17:09.680 --> 17:11.680\nIs that a line from the movie?\n\n17:11.680 --> 17:12.680\nNo.\n\n17:12.680 --> 17:15.080\nThat's not a line from humanity.\n\n17:15.080 --> 17:16.080\nThat's not.\n\n17:16.080 --> 17:18.680\nI have not seen the Iron Man films.\n\n17:18.680 --> 17:23.120\nAre people constantly saying you're too serious or you should be more serious?\n\n17:23.120 --> 17:30.560\nLike cool it is something people say to me, no one ever talks like that.\n\n17:30.560 --> 17:31.560\nThat's awful.\n\n17:31.560 --> 17:34.800\nIt's, and it's really long and it's like, it's just, it's terrible.\n\n17:34.800 --> 17:39.280\nAnd maybe it lost something in the translation, but it's all I could do to play this game\n\n17:39.280 --> 17:40.680\nfor the last two weeks.\n\n17:40.680 --> 17:42.960\nSo it's not enough to scare you off playing it.\n\n17:42.960 --> 17:43.960\nNo, I'm addicted.\n\n17:43.960 --> 17:45.360\nI love WASP selfies.\n\n17:45.360 --> 17:48.160\nI love the, I, they're all there.\n\n17:48.160 --> 17:49.880\nI'm leveling them up there.\n\n17:49.880 --> 17:54.640\nYou know, there's a, there's a little intrigue with director fury.\n\n17:54.640 --> 18:00.560\nYou know, he's like, you know, a black widow is like, you know, mistrustful of the Avengers\n\n18:00.560 --> 18:01.560\nAcademy.\n\n18:01.560 --> 18:05.240\nSo she's like, there's a whole, there's little plots and things, but really it's just, it's\n\n18:05.240 --> 18:06.840\njust a farming game.\n\n18:06.840 --> 18:07.840\nAll right.\n\n18:07.840 --> 18:11.640\nWell, so that's what I did today instead of writing a book.\n\n18:11.640 --> 18:16.280\nIf you, if, if, if, if you had a book deal, you'd play video games, right?\n\n18:16.280 --> 18:17.280\nDan?\n\n18:17.280 --> 18:20.160\nLike as well, you're playing video games, you're, you're not sitting there going, fuck,\n\n18:20.160 --> 18:21.160\nI want to kill myself.\n\n18:21.160 --> 18:23.600\nI wish I had a book deal.\n\n18:23.600 --> 18:25.320\nI trust me.\n\n18:25.320 --> 18:27.880\nI apparently, if you had a book deal, you'd play video games.\n\n18:27.880 --> 18:28.880\nDo you have a deadline?\n\n18:28.880 --> 18:29.880\nLike a...\n\n18:29.880 --> 18:30.880\nYeah.\n\n18:30.880 --> 18:31.880\nYeah, I do.\n\n18:31.880 --> 18:32.880\nLet's...\n\n18:32.880 --> 18:33.880\nOh yeah.\n\n18:33.880 --> 18:36.640\nThey're, they're, they're strict about that stuff in publishing.\n\n18:36.640 --> 18:37.640\nYes.\n\n18:37.640 --> 18:40.280\nHey, can you say how far off it is right now?\n\n18:40.280 --> 18:43.280\nIt's spring-ish.\n\n18:43.280 --> 18:46.640\nAren't we, aren't we currently in spring right now?\n\n18:46.640 --> 18:47.640\nYeah.\n\n18:47.640 --> 18:48.640\nYeah.\n\n18:48.640 --> 18:49.640\nYeah.\n\n18:49.640 --> 18:50.640\nSpring 2016?\n\n18:50.640 --> 18:52.640\nLet's get down to work on this book!\n\n18:52.640 --> 18:53.640\nOr not.\n\n18:53.640 --> 19:01.640\nIs something my agent's been telling me.\n\n19:01.640 --> 19:07.480\nWait, so you got a month or two left?\n\n19:07.480 --> 19:08.480\nJeff, stop.\n\n19:08.480 --> 19:09.480\nI'm trying to...\n\n19:09.480 --> 19:10.480\nYou're...\n\n19:10.480 --> 19:13.800\nIt's just that we're, we're gonna come up with a name for this, like the, the blood\n\n19:13.800 --> 19:15.040\nthirst that Jeff gets.\n\n19:15.040 --> 19:17.920\nNo, I'm not, this is not me trying to do a pecking party.\n\n19:17.920 --> 19:23.040\nI'm saying, like, how, how, I, I, I, this is honest curiosity, this is not me trying\n\n19:23.040 --> 19:24.040\nto...\n\n19:24.040 --> 19:25.040\nIt's, it's due soon, dude.\n\n19:25.040 --> 19:26.040\nOkay.\n\n19:26.040 --> 19:28.760\nI, I, how, are you, are you, are you clipping along?\n\n19:28.760 --> 19:29.760\nAre you making...\n\n19:29.760 --> 19:30.760\nNo!\n\n19:30.760 --> 19:31.760\nI'm not trying to...\n\n19:31.760 --> 19:35.760\nI wrote, I wrote a really good introduction.\n\n19:35.760 --> 19:38.240\nAnd I think I have a title and...\n\n19:38.240 --> 19:39.920\nIs it, is it autobiographical?\n\n19:39.920 --> 19:40.920\nIs it fiction?\n\n19:40.920 --> 19:41.920\nIs it...\n\n19:41.920 --> 19:42.920\nYoung Adult Detective series?\n\n19:42.920 --> 19:43.920\nWhat do you got?\n\n19:43.920 --> 19:47.200\nCan you please write a Young Adult Detective series?\n\n19:47.200 --> 19:50.960\nThat'd be so fucking awesome.\n\n19:50.960 --> 19:54.320\nOnce this hits the New York Times bestseller list, I'll, I'll, people will come back to\n\n19:54.320 --> 19:55.880\nme and go, what book would you like to write next?\n\n19:55.880 --> 20:01.640\nI'll go, hmm, maybe a Re-envisioning of Encyclopedia Brown.\n\n20:01.640 --> 20:03.040\nThat would be Heaven on Earth.\n\n20:03.040 --> 20:04.040\nYeah.\n\n20:04.040 --> 20:07.520\nOr maybe a Young Tony Stark for the guys.\n\n20:07.520 --> 20:14.800\nOh, this mystery is something I should really be saying to myself right now.\n\n20:14.800 --> 20:15.800\nUh...\n\n20:15.800 --> 20:18.600\nIt's just, it's just, it's just weird, right, Spencer?\n\n20:18.600 --> 20:23.800\nIt's, it's almost too upsetting a joke to even try and ape and make fun of, you know?\n\n20:23.800 --> 20:28.440\nI'm kind of like not laughing at your making fun of it, that's how bad the original joke\n\n20:28.440 --> 20:29.440\nis.\n\n20:29.440 --> 20:30.440\nIt's upsetting.\n\n20:30.440 --> 20:44.840\nUh, our next, our next guest...\n\n20:44.840 --> 20:47.120\nSometimes sadness can be its own segue.\n\n20:47.120 --> 20:50.680\nYeah, yeah, I don't...\n\n20:50.680 --> 20:56.480\nOur next guest has appeared at clubs and colleges all over the, he's, he's certainly a, certainly\n\n20:56.480 --> 21:01.080\na, a close cousin of the Harmontown family, but I don't know if he's ever been on Harmontown\n\n21:01.080 --> 21:02.080\nor not.\n\n21:02.080 --> 21:03.080\nI can't remember.\n\n21:03.080 --> 21:04.080\nI don't think he has.\n\n21:04.080 --> 21:05.080\nWell, let's ask him.\n\n21:05.080 --> 21:06.880\nUh, certainly people that listen to this podcast...\n\n21:06.880 --> 21:08.720\nI just believe that we don't remember that answer.\n\n21:08.720 --> 21:09.720\nProbably know who he is.\n\n21:09.720 --> 21:15.440\nI, uh, I recently called, uh, made a, you know, called him out, uh, on his middle initial\n\n21:15.440 --> 21:17.400\nand demanded to see his birth certificate.\n\n21:17.400 --> 21:21.040\nI don't, I don't know if he's, I don't know if he's brought it or not, but, uh, let's,\n\n21:21.040 --> 21:32.560\nlet's, let's, let's get to know Paul F. Tompkins, everybody.\n\n21:32.560 --> 21:50.880\nHi, hi, everybody, hi, internet, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi,\n\n21:50.880 --> 21:51.940\nhi.\n\n21:51.940 --> 21:53.500\nHi, hi.\n\n21:53.500 --> 21:57.380\nYou received the one Dave Kline standing ovation?\n\n21:57.380 --> 21:58.380\nThat's right.\n\n21:58.380 --> 21:59.380\nThat's right.\n\n21:59.380 --> 22:00.380\nThat's right.\n\n22:00.380 --> 22:01.380\nUh, yeah.\n\n22:01.380 --> 22:02.380\nUh, so, all right.\n\n22:02.380 --> 22:03.380\nA couple of things to get out of the way.\n\n22:03.380 --> 22:04.380\nYeah.\n\n22:04.380 --> 22:05.380\nLet's get right down to it, Dan.\n\n22:05.380 --> 22:06.380\nYeah.\n\n22:06.380 --> 22:07.620\nWell, I read, I don't know why I did this.\n\n22:07.620 --> 22:12.940\nI, I did no idea why I did this, I read an AV club comment section, uh...\n\n22:12.940 --> 22:14.340\nOh no.\n\n22:14.340 --> 22:18.480\nUnder, underneath a episode of Great Mines, this thing that you're going to do an episode\n\n22:18.480 --> 22:24.480\non the, my thing on the History Channel, which has now been rebranded history, so that it's\n\n22:24.480 --> 22:29.480\nconfusing. Because history is a thing, it's the opposite of branding. All right.\n\n22:29.480 --> 22:36.480\nSo do you think people will look for the show just in history?\n\n22:36.480 --> 22:41.480\nThey're like, dig up old tests that they took, that their mom saved in a shoebox.\n\n22:41.480 --> 22:44.480\nWas there anything about Dan Harmon's show in here?\n\n22:44.480 --> 22:51.480\nI understand what they're doing because they're saying, well, channel, that's my grandpa's TV's name.\n\n22:51.480 --> 23:00.480\nBecause what's a channel, grandpa? But if you take the channel off of history, you have, like,\n\n23:00.480 --> 23:04.480\nyou have just a word, a very, very, very vague word.\n\n23:04.480 --> 23:08.480\nAnd also a huge word that they're just laying claim to.\n\n23:08.480 --> 23:09.480\nYeah.\n\n23:09.480 --> 23:10.480\nThat's pretty bold.\n\n23:10.480 --> 23:14.480\nYeah. It'll never, it'll never trend. It's as dumb as naming your show.\n\n23:14.480 --> 23:15.480\nIt'll never trend.\n\n23:15.480 --> 23:20.480\nYeah. It's as stupid as naming your TV show community or something like that.\n\n23:20.480 --> 23:23.480\nLike, hey, how come we're not trending?\n\n23:23.480 --> 23:29.480\nOh, because you fucking, they had to take that word along with Justin Bieber and the out of the fucking\n\n23:29.480 --> 23:34.480\ntrending algorithm.\n\n23:34.480 --> 23:36.480\nIt's true.\n\n23:36.480 --> 23:38.480\nIt's very true.\n\n23:38.480 --> 23:41.480\nThe history channel is...\n\n23:41.480 --> 23:43.480\nHi, Paul, I'm right behind you.\n\n23:43.480 --> 23:46.480\nI'm sorry, I should have told you, Paul. Jeff's here.\n\n23:46.480 --> 23:48.480\nThe history channel is pretty light on history now.\n\n23:48.480 --> 23:52.480\nThere's a lot of UFO things and lots of weird conspiracy shit.\n\n23:52.480 --> 23:54.480\nYou're actually bringing it back.\n\n23:54.480 --> 23:56.480\nWell, with the comedy.\n\n23:56.480 --> 24:01.480\nI applaud that movement because we all love work, right?\n\n24:01.480 --> 24:05.480\nBut speaking of which, so I saw, you know, I don't know, I'm going to read no AV Club review,\n\n24:05.480 --> 24:07.480\nlet alone the comment section.\n\n24:07.480 --> 24:09.480\nI'm thinking, but then someone linked the thing.\n\n24:09.480 --> 24:10.480\nI don't know what it is.\n\n24:10.480 --> 24:12.480\nIf someone tweets a link and says, like, this show's great.\n\n24:12.480 --> 24:14.480\nAnd then they tweet a link to the review.\n\n24:14.480 --> 24:17.480\nI'll get tricked into thinking it's okay to read the review.\n\n24:17.480 --> 24:19.480\nAnd then I'll scroll down.\n\n24:19.480 --> 24:21.480\nI don't know why am I scrolling down?\n\n24:21.480 --> 24:24.480\nWhat bad thing are they going to say about my stupid late night thing and the thing?\n\n24:24.480 --> 24:28.480\nSo a big thing was that I ripped off Dead Authors podcast.\n\n24:28.480 --> 24:30.480\nRight.\n\n24:30.480 --> 24:33.480\nSo sorry about that.\n\n24:33.480 --> 24:38.480\nBecause somebody had said a similar thing to me, like, hey, isn't this the same idea?\n\n24:38.480 --> 24:40.480\nAnd it's not really the same idea.\n\n24:40.480 --> 24:46.480\nAnd also the idea for Dead Authors came from a Steve Allen show called Meeting of the Minds.\n\n24:46.480 --> 24:51.480\nWhich is what this show came from as well by Rich Corson, the daily show guy who created the show\n\n24:51.480 --> 24:56.480\nand hired me to host this pilot that didn't get picked up by IFC and then handed over to the History Channel.\n\n24:56.480 --> 25:02.480\nEssentially, people, anyone who was old enough to remember Meeting of the Minds with Steve Allen had in the back of their head,\n\n25:02.480 --> 25:04.480\nI wish this show was entertaining.\n\n25:04.480 --> 25:06.480\nYeah.\n\n25:06.480 --> 25:11.480\nAnd so eventually you grow up and you take power into your own hands.\n\n25:11.480 --> 25:13.480\nIt's a podcast, it's audio only.\n\n25:13.480 --> 25:16.480\nHave you committed it to the lookies?\n\n25:16.480 --> 25:22.480\nI mean, we would do, like the live shows we would do in costume.\n\n25:22.480 --> 25:26.480\nLike we would do it, you know, in front of an audience, in costume, in character.\n\n25:26.480 --> 25:28.480\nAlright, so I ripped it off then.\n\n25:28.480 --> 25:33.480\nBut it's not this, but I didn't come up with, I didn't come up with the Dead Authors concept.\n\n25:33.480 --> 25:35.480\nI just came up with the idea of doing it as a podcast.\n\n25:35.480 --> 25:37.480\nI got invited to do the show.\n\n25:37.480 --> 25:43.480\nIt was invented by a guy named John Corn in San Francisco who worked for 826 up there.\n\n25:43.480 --> 25:48.480\nAnd the idea was they would get someone to pretend to be a Dead Author in costume\n\n25:48.480 --> 25:52.480\nand they would like do a Q&A with people, with an audience.\n\n25:52.480 --> 25:58.480\nAnd then I got asked to do it with Jen Kirkman and Eddie Pepitone for a show.\n\n25:58.480 --> 26:03.480\nIt was the first time I did it and I, for whatever reason, decided to be HG Wells.\n\n26:03.480 --> 26:07.480\nAnd it was not decided beforehand how the show was going to go.\n\n26:07.480 --> 26:12.480\nAnd so the idea was the three of us would just go out in front of this audience of indifferent people\n\n26:12.480 --> 26:18.480\nand we would field questions from people who did not know what was going on and did not care.\n\n26:18.480 --> 26:24.480\nSo I said, how about I moderate it in character and the whole conceit came up right then.\n\n26:24.480 --> 26:28.480\nIt was like, let's say I transported you guys in my time machine which is real.\n\n26:28.480 --> 26:32.480\nAnd so I'll ask questions to get it going and then hopefully the audience would join in.\n\n26:32.480 --> 26:39.480\nWhich they didn't except for one very drunk person at three in the afternoon at the West Hollywood Book Fair.\n\n26:39.480 --> 26:42.480\nAnd that was it and then it was a lot of fun.\n\n26:42.480 --> 26:47.480\nAnd I said, well this could easily be a regular show and that was it.\n\n26:47.480 --> 26:50.480\nSo that sounds like it is derivative of it.\n\n26:50.480 --> 26:56.480\nI mean it sounds like it bumps enough that the people in that comment section weren't huge dicks by pointing it out.\n\n26:56.480 --> 26:58.480\nWhen there's a dot there, they'll connect it.\n\n26:58.480 --> 27:00.480\nThen they talked about my weight.\n\n27:00.480 --> 27:06.480\nThen they just didn't stop until it was rubble, just charred rubble.\n\n27:06.480 --> 27:13.480\nAnd I don't know, I don't understand, when did I start trying to convince people I was thin?\n\n27:13.480 --> 27:18.480\nHow many times do I have to parade around and go, look how fat and drunk I am?\n\n27:18.480 --> 27:23.480\nBefore the AV Club commenters stop trying to blow the fucking lid off of it like it's all the President's man or something.\n\n27:23.480 --> 27:26.480\nLike it's not a secret, but it hurts when you say it.\n\n27:26.480 --> 27:27.480\nIt hurts when you say it.\n\n27:27.480 --> 27:29.480\nBecause here's my one secret that I'm sensitive about.\n\n27:29.480 --> 27:30.480\nI'm a control freak.\n\n27:30.480 --> 27:31.480\nI don't want you saying it.\n\n27:31.480 --> 27:33.480\nI say it, I say it.\n\n27:33.480 --> 27:35.480\nMe.\n\n27:35.480 --> 27:41.480\nI don't like some fucking anonymous person sitting there in their basement in Washington State\n\n27:41.480 --> 27:44.480\nand fucking looks like somebody's been hitting the Hongadas.\n\n27:44.480 --> 27:47.480\nIt's not fair.\n\n27:47.480 --> 27:50.480\nIt's not funny and it's not fair.\n\n27:50.480 --> 27:51.480\nWhat show would you do?\n\n27:51.480 --> 27:55.480\nI bet you'd rip off a podcast too.\n\n27:55.480 --> 27:59.480\nWhat you're doing is talking about how fat people are.\n\n27:59.480 --> 28:01.480\nIs that a podcast?\n\n28:01.480 --> 28:03.480\nIs there someone hosting that?\n\n28:03.480 --> 28:04.480\nSurely someone is.\n\n28:04.480 --> 28:05.480\nThere should be.\n\n28:05.480 --> 28:06.480\nWho's fat this week?\n\n28:06.480 --> 28:08.480\nLet's take a look.\n\n28:08.480 --> 28:15.480\nThere should just be a comment section podcast where it's just like, welcome to what just\n\n28:15.480 --> 28:18.480\nhappened.\n\n28:18.480 --> 28:22.480\nYou know, Caterpillar 69, I don't know.\n\n28:22.480 --> 28:24.480\nI can't rip a name.\n\n28:24.480 --> 28:28.480\nI just typed that in at random when I logged in.\n\n28:28.480 --> 28:30.480\nSo that just happened.\n\n28:30.480 --> 28:33.480\nI'd rather die than watch that again.\n\n28:33.480 --> 28:40.480\nThey never tell you what they're commenting on, but they just... With me as always is\n\n28:40.480 --> 28:47.480\nthe person who's going to turn this into either race or right versus left.\n\n28:47.480 --> 28:53.480\nIt's very hard when you know those things are there and you read some of the links to\n\n28:53.480 --> 28:54.480\na thing that you've done.\n\n28:54.480 --> 29:00.480\nIt's very hard to have the self-control to not look at what people are saying.\n\n29:00.480 --> 29:06.480\nEven knowing that right under there, there's a bunch of fucking people talking about it\n\n29:06.480 --> 29:08.480\nand they're weighing in on what they think.\n\n29:08.480 --> 29:09.480\nIt's so difficult.\n\n29:09.480 --> 29:14.480\nThe only good thing was when community was running at its peak, if there was a bad review\n\n29:14.480 --> 29:16.480\nof a show, it was like, this episode wasn't that great.\n\n29:16.480 --> 29:18.480\nThen I'd go straight to the comment section.\n\n29:18.480 --> 29:20.480\nI was like, have Adam, boys.\n\n29:20.480 --> 29:22.480\nPick that skeleton clean.\n\n29:22.480 --> 29:28.480\nThere's something new to fucking eat up right above you.\n\n29:28.480 --> 29:34.480\nI said to Spencer on the way home, I was like, I did it the 800th time of 43 years old.\n\n29:34.480 --> 29:36.480\nI've learned this lesson over and over again.\n\n29:36.480 --> 29:37.480\nI don't know why I went there.\n\n29:37.480 --> 29:42.480\nThe only thing you could say was it's just like picking a piece of glass up off the floor\n\n29:42.480 --> 29:43.480\nand just stabbing yourself in the face.\n\n29:43.480 --> 29:44.480\nI was in a really good mood.\n\n29:44.480 --> 29:48.480\nI went there because you really have to run the thought experiment of seriously, really\n\n29:48.480 --> 29:54.480\nseriously run the thought experiment of what happens the day that you click on the AV Club\n\n29:54.480 --> 30:00.480\nreview and it says, well, whatever the review says, it's just a repeat of the press release.\n\n30:00.480 --> 30:04.480\nBut then the top comment says like, Harmon's never looked better.\n\n30:04.480 --> 30:07.480\nI think this idea is very original.\n\n30:07.480 --> 30:10.480\nI think he's on top of his game as ever.\n\n30:10.480 --> 30:11.480\nKudos to him.\n\n30:11.480 --> 30:12.480\nHats off to him.\n\n30:12.480 --> 30:17.480\nVery funny, very young looking, very thin, very sober.\n\n30:17.480 --> 30:19.480\nI salute you, sir.\n\n30:19.480 --> 30:23.480\nAnd then every comment for a thousand comments was, couldn't agree more.\n\n30:23.480 --> 30:24.480\nDitto.\n\n30:24.480 --> 30:26.480\nI second that.\n\n30:26.480 --> 30:27.480\nHere, here.\n\n30:27.480 --> 30:29.480\nThe eyes have it.\n\n30:29.480 --> 30:33.480\nYou would like scroll through that and then you'd go, well, I don't have to go there\n\n30:33.480 --> 30:34.480\never again.\n\n30:34.480 --> 30:39.480\nThat, well, I don't know why I'm saying the editorial, you.\n\n30:39.480 --> 30:45.480\nI would scroll through and go, but that's not a real thing.\n\n30:45.480 --> 30:51.480\nWouldn't a part of like yourself loathing, wouldn't, I mean, obviously it's this hypothetical\n\n30:51.480 --> 30:55.480\nthing, wouldn't you just automatically distrust all of that unanimous praise?\n\n30:55.480 --> 30:57.480\nWouldn't you like find a way to.\n\n30:57.480 --> 30:59.480\nThat's what I just said.\n\n30:59.480 --> 31:00.480\nOkay.\n\n31:00.480 --> 31:06.480\nHow dare you criticize me or agree with me.\n\n31:06.480 --> 31:10.480\nDan, you've never looked better.\n\n31:10.480 --> 31:13.480\nI could blow him up for the rest of the night.\n\n31:13.480 --> 31:15.480\nThat guy's on the hook.\n\n31:15.480 --> 31:17.480\nHe drank the Kool-Aid.\n\n31:17.480 --> 31:19.480\nI mean, that's terrible, right?\n\n31:19.480 --> 31:23.480\nYou know, I always get mad when people tweet, they tweet at me and they go, by the way,\n\n31:23.480 --> 31:27.480\nwe'll ask you some questions later.\n\n31:27.480 --> 31:35.480\nAre they about you?\n\n31:35.480 --> 31:42.480\nBingo.\n\n31:42.480 --> 31:44.480\nI'll try to involve you in this.\n\n31:44.480 --> 31:45.480\nAs best you can.\n\n31:45.480 --> 31:54.480\nHave people ever tweeted you and said, hey, either positively or negatively, but with\n\n31:54.480 --> 32:03.480\nthe handle on it, of like, hey, I know you don't like it when people are positive, but.\n\n32:03.480 --> 32:04.480\nNo.\n\n32:04.480 --> 32:07.480\nI have not gotten that specific.\n\n32:07.480 --> 32:10.480\nThat's like a methodology I've fostered.\n\n32:10.480 --> 32:11.480\nPeople will go like.\n\n32:11.480 --> 32:13.480\nYou don't like it when people are positive.\n\n32:13.480 --> 32:16.480\nThere's two categories of that.\n\n32:16.480 --> 32:21.480\nPeople will go, hey, I know you don't respond to people being nice, so fuck off and your\n\n32:21.480 --> 32:22.480\nshow's awful.\n\n32:22.480 --> 32:23.480\nAnd I'm like, okay, I get it.\n\n32:23.480 --> 32:25.480\nWe've run that through the periscope and the mirror's bouncing.\n\n32:25.480 --> 32:26.480\nYou're saying good show.\n\n32:26.480 --> 32:29.480\nFuck off.\n\n32:29.480 --> 32:34.480\nActually, the person that annoys me a little bit more is the sweet, nice person who's saying,\n\n32:34.480 --> 32:42.480\nhey, I just want to let you know, I really like Rick and Morty, but I know you don't\n\n32:42.480 --> 32:48.480\ncare about people who like your stuff, but I thought I'd tell you anyway.\n\n32:48.480 --> 32:53.480\nAnd I always take back those people, fuck you.\n\n32:53.480 --> 32:56.480\nThat's fair.\n\n32:56.480 --> 33:01.480\nBut you interact with people a lot online, right?\n\n33:01.480 --> 33:03.480\nSo they know.\n\n33:03.480 --> 33:11.480\nBut I mean, the thing is, because I don't respond to a ton of people and I don't really\n\n33:11.480 --> 33:17.480\nI don't really, I don't like respond to any, certainly not anything negative unless I am\n\n33:17.480 --> 33:22.480\na thousand percent sure that I am, it doesn't bother me.\n\n33:22.480 --> 33:23.480\nDo you know what I mean?\n\n33:23.480 --> 33:26.480\nLike I can make a joke out of it and I can quote the thing that they said and make a\n\n33:26.480 --> 33:27.480\njoke out of it.\n\n33:27.480 --> 33:30.480\nIf I just think, oh, this is dumb and it doesn't actually hurt my feelings.\n\n33:30.480 --> 33:33.480\nI just saw the hateful eight last night.\n\n33:33.480 --> 33:39.480\nYou're, Tim Roth's character says, if you're, if you're, if you're, when you're hanging\n\n33:39.480 --> 33:44.480\nsomebody, if it's, if there's an ounce of passion to it, you maybe shouldn't be hanging\n\n33:44.480 --> 33:45.480\nthem.\n\n33:45.480 --> 33:50.480\nSo when you're responding to a tweet, you're, I think that's what you're saying is like,\n\n33:50.480 --> 33:54.480\nyou run it through a filter of like, am I, is there anything happening here where I'm\n\n33:54.480 --> 34:00.480\njust not like kind of like, you know, a good professional like dealer or pit boss at the\n\n34:00.480 --> 34:05.480\nTompkins casino, just, just doing my job, entertaining, like, like, like making sure everybody's\n\n34:05.480 --> 34:07.480\nlike being dealt with fairly.\n\n34:07.480 --> 34:11.480\nObviously what it is, if, if it makes me laugh, if it's like someone's trying to say a mean\n\n34:11.480 --> 34:13.480\nthing, but it just makes me laugh.\n\n34:13.480 --> 34:14.480\nI'm like, oh, this is great.\n\n34:14.480 --> 34:16.480\nAnd then I will tweet that out.\n\n34:16.480 --> 34:20.480\nBut I, so I don't, I don't respond a lot because it's like, where does, to me it's like, where\n\n34:20.480 --> 34:21.480\ndoes it end?\n\n34:21.480 --> 34:22.480\nYou know,\n\n34:22.480 --> 34:24.480\nYou may have someone insults you and it's funny.\n\n34:24.480 --> 34:25.480\nYou'll retweet it.\n\n34:25.480 --> 34:26.480\nIs that what you're saying?\n\n34:26.480 --> 34:27.480\nIf they're trying to,\n\n34:27.480 --> 34:29.480\nIf it's so absurd that it doesn't, it doesn't hurt his feet.\n\n34:29.480 --> 34:30.480\nYes.\n\n34:30.480 --> 34:32.480\nIf the intent was to hurt my feelings, but it failed.\n\n34:32.480 --> 34:33.480\nYeah.\n\n34:33.480 --> 34:36.480\nBut, but if you, if you felt any wound or any passion in it or any like, I gotta, I gotta\n\n34:36.480 --> 34:37.480\nsettle the score.\n\n34:37.480 --> 34:38.480\nYou, you, you leave,\n\n34:38.480 --> 34:39.480\nI will not give it attention.\n\n34:39.480 --> 34:40.480\nYou leave that one alone.\n\n34:40.480 --> 34:41.480\nYes.\n\n34:41.480 --> 34:42.480\nThat's very wise.\n\n34:42.480 --> 34:43.480\nIt's very smart.\n\n34:43.480 --> 34:46.480\nAs a result, I think because you do interact with people so much, there are people that\n\n34:46.480 --> 34:48.480\njust want your attention in some way or another.\n\n34:48.480 --> 34:49.480\nRight.\n\n34:49.480 --> 34:54.480\nAnd so, and I've seen this happen with other people where I've seen like somebody right,\n\n34:54.480 --> 34:59.480\nlike to, uh, I forget who it was, but they wrote a bunch of positive things, didn't get\n\n34:59.480 --> 35:03.480\na response, and then wrote a negative thing just to get a response from this person.\n\n35:03.480 --> 35:05.480\nAnd then they said, this is why I did this.\n\n35:05.480 --> 35:06.480\nYeah.\n\n35:06.480 --> 35:09.980\nAnd that has to be a huge, I'm sure you know this, that, that has to be a giant part of\n\n35:09.980 --> 35:14.480\npeople poking you is because they know that you might, you might fire back at them.\n\n35:14.480 --> 35:15.480\nRight.\n\n35:15.480 --> 35:20.980\nBut, but what I've, what I find over and over and over again is that there's, that, that\n\n35:20.980 --> 35:29.080\neventually they will, they will unfollow me and block me because they don't want just\n\n35:29.080 --> 35:30.080\nattention.\n\n35:30.080 --> 35:35.460\nIt's like, and I'm obsessed with, I was obsessed with that, like going, going like, so that's\n\n35:35.460 --> 35:36.460\nthe game we're playing.\n\n35:36.460 --> 35:39.600\nLike you just want my attention because then they go through all the phases where they're\n\n35:39.600 --> 35:41.960\nlike, what kind of loser are you paying attention to me?\n\n35:41.960 --> 35:44.960\nAnd then it's like three days later, they're like, leave me alone.\n\n35:44.960 --> 35:47.960\nAnd I'm like, are we, are we, what are we done?\n\n35:47.960 --> 35:51.040\nI want to talk to you.\n\n35:51.040 --> 35:54.440\nYou got Dan Harmon on the line once you, what's, what's going on?\n\n35:54.440 --> 35:55.440\nHow's your mom?\n\n35:55.440 --> 35:56.440\nHow's your blog?\n\n35:56.440 --> 36:04.320\nUh, but anyways, the, the, I would say that people like, like absolutely, of course all\n\n36:04.320 --> 36:10.000\nthis is true, but when, when, when you, when you send a positive tweet to somebody, uh,\n\n36:10.000 --> 36:14.120\nyou know, no news is good news.\n\n36:14.120 --> 36:15.560\nLike, like, like, you know,\n\n36:15.560 --> 36:18.480\nWell, you, you, you pays your money and he takes your chances.\n\n36:18.480 --> 36:19.480\nYou know what I mean?\n\n36:19.480 --> 36:21.120\nLike you, you write a thing out there.\n\n36:21.120 --> 36:24.640\nThe idea is that you write a thing because this is genuinely how you feel.\n\n36:24.640 --> 36:25.640\nRight.\n\n36:25.640 --> 36:28.720\nIt's not supposed to be about, you know, what you, of course you hope that someone will\n\n36:28.720 --> 36:29.720\nrespond.\n\n36:29.720 --> 36:33.280\nI've written positive things to people that I admired, you know, after like hearing an\n\n36:33.280 --> 36:35.520\nalbum or watching a TV show or whatever.\n\n36:35.520 --> 36:36.520\nNo response.\n\n36:36.520 --> 36:39.120\nAnd it's like, Oh, it would have been nice if the person said something, but I didn't\n\n36:39.120 --> 36:40.320\nfeel like I was owed that.\n\n36:40.320 --> 36:42.120\nTell us who it was.\n\n36:42.120 --> 36:46.720\nMariah Carey, Mariah Carey.\n\n36:46.720 --> 36:51.480\nWhen she split up with Tommy Matola, I was so proud of her and I was like, I wish someone\n\n36:51.480 --> 36:53.720\nwould have been Twitter so I could tell her all about it.\n\n36:53.720 --> 36:57.680\nI'm not good on the timeline with when Mariah Carey left Tommy Matola.\n\n36:57.680 --> 36:58.680\nI can't remember.\n\n36:58.680 --> 36:59.960\nTwitter was in her lives at that point.\n\n36:59.960 --> 37:01.480\nWhy is his mic so loud?\n\n37:01.480 --> 37:02.480\nAre you an auctioneer?\n\n37:02.480 --> 37:03.480\nYeah.\n\n37:03.480 --> 37:04.480\nI am.\n\n37:04.480 --> 37:07.040\nI'm like a slow roll auctioneer.\n\n37:07.040 --> 37:09.040\nPaul, I don't do the fast.\n\n37:09.040 --> 37:11.040\nPaul, what is the next item up for auction?\n\n37:11.040 --> 37:12.200\nWhat is the next item up for bid?\n\n37:12.200 --> 37:15.040\nIt is a pair of jackalope antlers.\n\n37:15.040 --> 37:22.240\nThis whimsical gift can be found all over the Tex-Mex areas of the country.\n\n37:22.240 --> 37:24.240\nWhat's our starting price?\n\n37:24.240 --> 37:25.240\n$1.\n\n37:25.240 --> 37:27.480\nDo you have a yop?\n\n37:27.480 --> 37:30.880\nIs that my, is that my, is that my imagination?\n\n37:30.880 --> 37:33.880\nBecause I think he just got such a strange theater voice.\n\n37:33.880 --> 37:35.880\nI'm also yelling.\n\n37:35.880 --> 37:40.040\nIs that, no, it told me not to yell.\n\n37:40.040 --> 37:42.360\nSo I've been yelling the whole time.\n\n37:42.360 --> 37:47.280\nI've never trusted these things.\n\n37:47.280 --> 37:52.440\nDan, Dan, what percentage of your replies to people, do you ever reply to positive stuff?\n\n37:52.440 --> 37:53.440\nDo you go, hey, thank you.\n\n37:53.440 --> 37:54.440\nNice to hear from you.\n\n37:54.440 --> 37:55.440\nAbsolutely.\n\n37:55.440 --> 37:56.440\nOkay.\n\n37:56.440 --> 37:57.440\nSo does that even out?\n\n37:57.440 --> 37:58.440\nIs it 55?\n\n37:58.440 --> 38:04.280\nI mean, in the fucking 38 years I've been on Twitter, whatever it's been, I've gone through\n\n38:04.280 --> 38:07.400\ndifferent phases where, because that stuff got to me where I'd make sure I'd actually\n\n38:07.400 --> 38:14.040\ncount and I'd go, okay, 50%, like, just to shove it up the ass of the people I hate.\n\n38:14.040 --> 38:15.720\nI'm like, thank you, Nancy.\n\n38:15.720 --> 38:20.480\nVery nice to be said, blah, blah, blah.\n\n38:20.480 --> 38:22.440\nFucking asshole on that guy back there.\n\n38:22.440 --> 38:25.640\nYou know, like it's still worshiping at the altar of hatred.\n\n38:25.640 --> 38:26.640\nHey, Paul.\n\n38:26.640 --> 38:27.640\nYeah.\n\n38:27.640 --> 38:29.320\nHow many suits made?\n\n38:29.320 --> 38:32.560\nI don't have a lot of suits made for myself.\n\n38:32.560 --> 38:34.080\nI buy a lot of stuff off the rack.\n\n38:34.080 --> 38:35.080\nYou do.\n\n38:35.080 --> 38:39.640\nI've had my wedding suit made for me by Mr. Lee of Fairfax Avenue.\n\n38:39.640 --> 38:40.640\nYeah.\n\n38:40.640 --> 38:41.640\nVery grumpy.\n\n38:41.640 --> 38:43.120\nTaylor, who did a wonderful job making my suit.\n\n38:43.120 --> 38:44.120\nTaylor's should be grumpy in my experience.\n\n38:44.120 --> 38:52.640\nIs it true that Mr. Lee was killed by the triads for sharing his suitmaking secrets?\n\n38:52.640 --> 38:55.920\nThat's the story they'd like you to believe.\n\n38:55.920 --> 38:59.320\nNow your mic is way too quiet.\n\n38:59.320 --> 39:00.320\nBecause he's not yelling.\n\n39:00.320 --> 39:08.200\nI thought we were getting quiet, talking about the triads.\n\n39:08.200 --> 39:10.000\nIt's called modulation, dad.\n\n39:10.000 --> 39:12.640\nHe's got dynamism.\n\n39:12.640 --> 39:13.640\nHe's got levels.\n\n39:13.640 --> 39:15.480\nAre you hearing me exclusively through the system?\n\n39:15.480 --> 39:16.480\nI don't know what it is.\n\n39:16.480 --> 39:17.480\nNo.\n\n39:17.480 --> 39:20.000\nBecause we're sitting a foot from each other.\n\n39:20.000 --> 39:24.160\nWhen I listen to Jeff, like, I actually, it sounds, I mean, it's just, we're amplified.\n\n39:24.160 --> 39:28.200\nI don't know why it's taken me 200 shows to figure this out.\n\n39:28.200 --> 39:31.360\nWhy is this guy so loud?\n\n39:31.360 --> 39:32.360\nWhat's that stick he's holding?\n\n39:32.360 --> 39:36.120\nWhy doesn't he lick his ice cream cone?\n\n39:36.120 --> 39:37.360\nWho eats black ice cream?\n\n39:37.360 --> 39:42.560\nWho's ice cream matches their cone?\n\n39:42.560 --> 39:44.320\nI bet that's a problem for someone.\n\n39:44.320 --> 39:51.720\nI bet there's people that can't eat ice cream in a cone because they would like the ice\n\n39:51.720 --> 39:53.640\ncream to be the same color as the cone.\n\n39:53.640 --> 39:56.000\nAnd so they're stuck with, like, coffee.\n\n39:56.000 --> 39:57.000\nYeah.\n\n39:57.000 --> 40:00.920\nYou could maybe some butter pecan, maybe it would be a close, right?\n\n40:00.920 --> 40:02.640\nYou're talking about monochromophiliacs.\n\n40:02.640 --> 40:03.640\nYeah.\n\n40:03.640 --> 40:04.640\nYeah.\n\n40:04.640 --> 40:08.320\nI bet that's the case.\n\n40:08.320 --> 40:09.960\nI bet those people...\n\n40:09.960 --> 40:12.160\nLet's make the rest of the show about that.\n\n40:12.160 --> 40:13.880\nAll right.\n\n40:13.880 --> 40:15.760\nI dare us.\n\n40:15.760 --> 40:18.680\nI mean, is it, do you think it applies specifically to food?\n\n40:18.680 --> 40:19.680\nIt's just food.\n\n40:19.680 --> 40:23.480\nI need all my food to be the same color, or I can't eat.\n\n40:23.480 --> 40:24.480\nThe fictional people?\n\n40:24.480 --> 40:25.480\nYeah.\n\n40:25.480 --> 40:26.480\nWhat's that?\n\n40:26.480 --> 40:27.480\nIt's sexual.\n\n40:27.480 --> 40:28.480\nIt's sexual?\n\n40:28.480 --> 40:29.480\nAll right.\n\n40:29.480 --> 40:30.480\nThe perfect chiming.\n\n40:30.480 --> 40:35.480\nThat works for every day.\n\n40:35.480 --> 40:38.680\nHe says that every five minutes regardless of the topic.\n\n40:38.680 --> 40:48.120\nYesterday, we were like, we do the show every day, we're like, what's the real deal between\n\n40:48.120 --> 40:50.560\nthe Hillary supporters and the Bernie supporters?\n\n40:50.560 --> 40:56.520\nIt's sexual, which is what got Gloria Steinem in all kinds of trouble.\n\n40:56.520 --> 40:57.920\nRight.\n\n40:57.920 --> 41:03.360\nBut even a broken clock is right twice a day.\n\n41:03.360 --> 41:06.560\nI don't know.\n\n41:06.560 --> 41:11.560\nI guess when in doubt, make the offended sound, is that what we meant?\n\n41:11.560 --> 41:14.560\nThey were like, hey, oh, oh, oh, oh.\n\n41:14.560 --> 41:15.560\nWait a minute, Paul.\n\n41:15.560 --> 41:16.560\nYes, yes, yes.\n\n41:16.560 --> 41:17.560\nPaul.\n\n41:17.560 --> 41:18.560\nYes.\n\n41:18.560 --> 41:19.560\nYou had one suit.\n\n41:19.560 --> 41:23.240\nI'm assuming you still have it and you haven't had it destroyed.\n\n41:23.240 --> 41:24.240\nIt's a fantastic suit.\n\n41:24.240 --> 41:27.560\nI never wear a suit more than once.\n\n41:27.560 --> 41:28.560\nThat is eccentric.\n\n41:28.560 --> 41:29.560\nAnd I love that.\n\n41:29.560 --> 41:34.400\nYou have a suit that is exactly the mayor from JAWS's suit with the anchors on it.\n\n41:34.400 --> 41:35.560\nThat suit I had made as well.\n\n41:35.560 --> 41:36.560\nOf course.\n\n41:36.560 --> 41:37.640\nYou didn't get that off the rack.\n\n41:37.640 --> 41:40.880\nThat was made by Cebo.\n\n41:40.880 --> 41:44.200\nNot far from here, a few doors down from the improv.\n\n41:44.200 --> 41:47.960\nThis guy, Cebo, makes, he was recommended to me by Dana Gould, very funny comedian.\n\n41:47.960 --> 41:49.480\nI love Dana Gould.\n\n41:49.480 --> 41:58.480\nAnd I had wanted, since I was a child, the blazer that the mayor wears in JAWS is covered\n\n41:58.480 --> 41:59.480\nwith anchors.\n\n41:59.480 --> 42:01.480\nIt's like a powder blue kind of thing.\n\n42:01.480 --> 42:03.480\nIt's beautiful.\n\n42:03.480 --> 42:04.480\nIt's triumphant.\n\n42:04.480 --> 42:05.480\nIt is triumphant.\n\n42:05.480 --> 42:10.480\nIt is a sartorial triumph.\n\n42:10.480 --> 42:14.480\nAnd so I searched everywhere for it to not find it.\n\n42:14.480 --> 42:21.480\nNo, Larry King, Larry Storch, Larry Gilmore, big point.\n\n42:21.480 --> 42:22.480\nShit.\n\n42:22.480 --> 42:23.480\nDamn it.\n\n42:23.480 --> 42:24.480\nSensitive, brother.\n\n42:24.480 --> 42:26.480\nNo, the character's name is Larry.\n\n42:26.480 --> 42:27.480\nLarry Vaughn.\n\n42:27.480 --> 42:28.480\nAll right.\n\n42:28.480 --> 42:29.480\nNo, we'll look it up.\n\n42:29.480 --> 42:30.480\nSorry.\n\n42:30.480 --> 42:31.480\nMurray Hamilton.\n\n42:31.480 --> 42:32.480\nMurray Hamilton.\n\n42:32.480 --> 42:33.480\nOkay.\n\n42:33.480 --> 42:34.480\nNow you're yelling.\n\n42:34.480 --> 42:35.480\nNow you're yelling.\n\n42:35.480 --> 42:36.480\nIt's sexual.\n\n42:36.480 --> 42:37.480\nOkay.\n\n42:37.480 --> 42:38.480\nSee?\n\n42:38.480 --> 42:42.680\nThat didn't even apply.\n\n42:42.680 --> 42:44.680\nSo I searched high and low for this jacket.\n\n42:44.680 --> 42:45.680\nOh, tell him.\n\n42:45.680 --> 42:46.680\nHe's the one that cares about your suit.\n\n42:46.680 --> 42:47.680\nThat's true.\n\n42:47.680 --> 42:48.680\nThat's true.\n\n42:48.680 --> 42:49.680\nSo I searched high and low.\n\n42:49.680 --> 42:53.960\nThere's two different podcasts going on here.\n\n42:53.960 --> 43:02.360\nI couldn't find the jacket itself, but then I talked about it on another podcast.\n\n43:02.360 --> 43:07.280\nAnd someone sent me a link to the material, and they said, here's where you can find\n\n43:07.280 --> 43:08.440\nthis material.\n\n43:08.440 --> 43:10.200\nThey have the material laying about?\n\n43:10.200 --> 43:11.200\nThey have the material laying about.\n\n43:11.200 --> 43:12.760\nAnd it's close enough.\n\n43:12.760 --> 43:13.760\nClose enough.\n\n43:13.760 --> 43:19.360\nAnd so I get a few yards of this fabric, and I take it to the Maestro, Sibo.\n\n43:19.360 --> 43:20.360\nAnd he's very excited.\n\n43:20.360 --> 43:22.040\nHe likes making unusual stuff.\n\n43:22.040 --> 43:23.840\nSo he was very excited.\n\n43:23.840 --> 43:26.160\nAnd it was perfect.\n\n43:26.160 --> 43:29.840\nIt was like I had enough material to make not just the jacket, but entire suit, entire\n\n43:29.840 --> 43:30.840\nthree-piece suit.\n\n43:30.840 --> 43:31.840\nYou made the vest too?\n\n43:31.840 --> 43:32.840\nYeah.\n\n43:32.840 --> 43:33.840\nFantastic.\n\n43:33.840 --> 43:34.840\nAll right.\n\n43:34.840 --> 43:35.840\nI'm going to go back to my podium, Paul.\n\n43:35.840 --> 43:36.840\nGreat talking to you.\n\n43:36.840 --> 43:37.840\nJeff, always a pleasure.\n\n43:37.840 --> 43:48.200\nThat was a taste of Jeff's new Feral Audio podcast.\n\n43:48.200 --> 43:50.400\nJeff Onman.\n\n43:50.400 --> 43:51.400\nSuits.\n\n43:51.400 --> 43:52.400\nMeets.\n\n43:52.400 --> 43:59.040\nI listened for it.\n\n43:59.040 --> 44:00.040\nIt's

46:11.040\nsmoke wow we'll see there's a good secret right there it's like it's like\n\n46:11.040 --> 46:14.520\nthere's something to do with ratio like a sailboat actually you know there's more\n\n46:14.520 --> 46:22.400\nsailboat going on underneath the water ooh it's sexual you're lead up you know\n\n46:22.400 --> 46:29.160\nyeah which is not to say anybody who's listening oh you know you dated for three\n\n46:29.160 --> 46:32.400\nmonths and you love each other get married I'm just saying like like people\n\n46:32.400 --> 46:36.920\nwho Schrab I officiated his wedding he'd been living with Kate for seven years\n\n46:36.920 --> 46:40.640\nthey say they I mean give me a break they're not they're not gonna like come\n\n46:40.640 --> 46:47.000\nhome from from the wedding and be

every morning because it dilutes the taste to chew it\n\n47:01.560 --> 47:09.920\nand yet ironically the generation's preceding us as the sort of a version\n\n47:09.920 --> 47:14.200\nto living in sin increases so does it seems the longevity of the marriage\n\n47:14.200 --> 47:18.840\nright Schrab's parents were probably who probably I'm gonna guess I don't want to\n\n47:18.840 --> 47:22.040\nget

and they and they\n\n47:49.800 --> 47:54.560\nhave their own methods of doing things and anyone who has something successful\n\n47:54.560 --> 47:58.520\nwhether it's a career whether it's a marriage whatever they assume that their\n\n47:58.520 --> 48:02.920\nway is the only way because results speak for themselves but that advice might\n\n48:02.920 --> 48:07.960\nnot apply to other individuals it's like you just can't live your life by other\n\n48:07.960 --> 48:12.160\npeople's example what if we all applied the Jim Belushi method of becoming as\n\n48:12.160 --> 48:18.920\nfamous as Jim

what year did you come here 1994 now I remember seeing you in a very\n\n52:09.480 --> 52:15.280\nearly days stand-up show at the Onyx cafe on Vermont which is no longer there\n\n52:15.280 --> 52:19.360\nyes and it was really early days and I'd never heard seen you before also it's\n\n52:19.360 --> 52:22.760\nthe first time I ever saw Sarah Silverman sure I think it might have been\n\n52:22.760 --> 52:26.800\ntenacious D's first show they ever did was there I think their first show was\n\n52:26.800 --> 52:31.080\nat Al's bar a really I talked to Jack about this and he goes that might have\n\n52:31.080 --> 52:38.480\nbeen our first or second show but he wasn't sure second all right but I got\n\n52:38.480 --> 52:41.520\nto say I remember two things about you I remember okay this guy's really funny\n\n52:41.520 --> 52:45.000\nand I liked your style and you had a great vocabulary and a great command of\n\n52:45.000 --> 52:50.000\nthe English language but also your suit rumbled you had a rumbled suit and then\n\n52:50.000 --> 52:52.360\nI was like that's the guy with the rumble suit but now you've come you've\n\n52:52.360 --> 52:57.400\nbecome this like exquisitely dressed gentleman and I love that about you I\n\n52:57.400 --> 53:01.440\nthink I just could not afford to have things not rumbled in those days I think\n\n53:01.440 --> 53:07.400\nI think that was like all of us back there yeah see what I first saw you\n\n53:07.400 --> 53:18.000\nsuit smooth as silk I thought could you it could be a little funnier so I don't\n\n53:18.000 --> 53:23.160\nknow if that was still true I thought I didn't\n\n53:23.160 --> 53:27.440\nvert the dichotomy I guess this is what I was doing are you still are you still\n\n53:27.440 --> 53:32.800\ndoing that speakeasy show no I resigned from that I did it for a while and it\n\n53:32.800 --> 53:36.600\nwas I enjoyed doing it for I was an interview series and I interviewed Dan\n\n53:36.600 --> 53:40.080\non it and we had a lovely chat but it's still available you can still find it on\n\n53:40.080 --> 53:46.440\nYouTube but I did it for a while and then it just became another thing to\n\n53:46.440 --> 53:51.160\nschedule in my life and that the returns were diminishing it was because we would\n\n53:51.160 --> 53:56.600\nshoot them four at a time yeah and so like the first couple interviews like\n\n53:56.600 --> 54:03.840\nthis is fun this is great then Marc Maron came and you walked away from that\n\n54:03.840 --> 54:10.000\none you're like what am I doing I did it so long after Marc Maron believe it or\n\n54:10.000 --> 54:17.840\nnot for like maximum self destructiveness it was fun for a while but\n\n54:17.840 --> 54:22.320\nthen I eventually it was I had other things going on and it was like it just\n\n54:22.320 --> 54:25.680\nwasn't stopping fun yeah stopping fun you will find when you come and do this\n\n54:25.680 --> 54:34.520\nshow for the for history for the history flux that I am approaching that event\n\n54:34.520 --> 54:43.320\nhorizon burnout I may be a husk of a man when you have you shot so far I've\n\n54:43.320 --> 54:48.120\nlost count which is good something like 9 or 9 or 10 they've all been great over\n\n54:48.120 --> 54:56.840\nthere oh yeah Spencer have you been here this whole time yeah I didn't have\n\n54:56.840 --> 55:07.480\nanything to chime in until just right there about 9 you know that's what I\n\n55:07.480 --> 55:12.560\ngot Spencer are you enjoying being an actor on the show you it's it's weird I\n\n55:12.560 --> 55:16.560\nmean the hard part about acting as best I could tell is memorizing and reciting\n\n55:16.560 --> 55:21.640\nlines and we kind of do it all improv-y style so it's just like whatever you\n\n55:21.640 --> 55:25.240\nthink of to say just say it and you know it's a lot easier when you're not\n\n55:25.240 --> 55:31.800\ntrying to hit lines yeah and by the way I know it gets frustrating when I come\n\n55:31.800 --> 55:35.160\nin and I go this script is done we'll throw it out we're gonna improvise the\n\n55:35.160 --> 55:39.680\nstuff but then when you you did a whole scene he did like what an hour and a half\n\n55:39.680 --> 55:44.720\ntwo hours of straight improv with Nick Kroll just two so it's like like it was\n\n55:44.720 --> 55:50.520\nKroll I'm not spoiling anything Kroll plays Sigmund Freud and he he psycho\n\n55:50.520 --> 55:58.640\nanalyzed Spencer for two hours it was all one take and Spencer just just\n\n55:58.640 --> 56:03.680\nanswered honestly the perfect actor like you do you're acting perfectly and\n\n56:03.680 --> 56:08.680\nthen and then and then and then Steve Levy came in and played himself and he\n\n56:08.680 --> 56:15.880\ndid it perfectly too but we're not gonna do two-hour takes right no no no are we\n\n56:15.880 --> 56:19.800\nallowed to are we allowed to know who Paul's going to portray yeah well I yeah\n\n56:19.800 --> 56:26.280\nunless you have some reason to not I'm cool with this I'm cool with it being\n\n56:26.280 --> 56:29.800\nout there I like teasing it I believe you're gonna play Edgar Allen Poe that's\n\n56:29.800 --> 56:32.320\ncorrect yeah\n\n56:32.320 --> 56:38.400\ngot a pro fans who has who has figured into my life in a weird way because the the place\n\n56:38.400 --> 56:42.240\nwhere my wife grew up on Sullivan's Island South Carolina there's a lot of\n\n56:42.240 --> 56:47.880\npost of there because he spent as Edgar Allen Poe seemingly did all over the\n\n56:47.880 --> 56:53.120\nfucking place he spent a good amount of his life there and his story the\n\n56:53.120 --> 56:58.120\nGoldbug is inspired by Goldbug Island there in South Carolina what happens\n\n56:58.120 --> 57:02.320\nin the Goldbug I have no idea I remember the Goldbug from the Richard\n\n57:02.320 --> 57:09.880\nscary novels who's a children's author and no it's scary or scary

Rourke and tattoo it be walking or somebody be walking\n\n01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:23.880\nlike what an island and in the background there's all these\n\n01:07:23.880 --> 01:07:28.480\npeople that aren't working there they're customers too they didn't get off the\n\n01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:33.160\nsea plane what package did they get like and how much of their fantasies are\n\n01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:37.240\nhappening are they just getting anal beads like like like they don't get\n\n01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:40.600\nthey don't get greeted by mr. Rourke that's like Captain Steuben's table maybe\n\n01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:43.760\nthey got up maybe there's flights happening all day long we just get to see\n\n01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:51.040\none or two you know like a week you know well tattoo does say Duplain\n\n01:07:51.040 --> 01:08:01.280\nhe doesn't say one of Duplain yeah yeah another plane boss the 815 the 815 why\n\n01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:06.400\nis why is the briefing happening as the people are getting off the plane was\n\n01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:10.400\nlike this one boss is like oh I guess I should have told you this why

put these dots what about my\n\n01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:35.320\nfantasy tattoo illiteracy does not count as a fantasy you're just being lazy\n\n01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:41.320\nbut my fantasy is you learn to read there was an episode where tattoo had to be a\n\n01:08:41.320 --> 01:08:46.120\nspaceman he had to be a little Martian and he had to put on green makeup and a\n\n01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:52.560\nbald cap and everything so it's it's it's very unclear as to how this whole\n\n01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:56.440\noperation works and I think that in the in the earlier before you know Satan\n\n01:08:56.440 --> 01:09:00.960\nshows up they they tried to I think the idea was it was just mysterious like how\n\n01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:05.720\ndo you do this he's like I wouldn't you like to know and that was it's 9-11 it's\n\n01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:13.840\n9-11 yes it's Duplain all right Paul well what's happening Paul we we at\n\n01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:20.000\nHarmontown cheer when

01:09:44.120\ntwice a day a broken clock remembers twice but five years from now when\n\n01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:47.480\nwhen McKenna and I do that because we want to write this pilot and it's just\n\n01:09:47.480 --> 01:09:51.760\nthis is not gold bullion idea either but and I'm sure you've come up with it as\n\n01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:57.840\nwell but like the ultimate workplace comedy is
