the people in\n\n37:10.400 --> 37:14.200\nthe podcast would realize that the mic stand is like one and a half Adams tall\n\n37:14.200 --> 37:20.160\nat this point not jealous that they're they're always exciting people in the\n\n37:20.160 --> 37:24.640\naudience in the dose of two and a half minutes but every week I give you a\n\n37:24.640 --> 37:31.320\nconsistently bad seven and a half minutes and quality quality is eclipsed by\n\n37:31.320 --> 37:40.040\nquantity every single time Adam describe your apartment in rap or is this\n\n37:40.040 --> 37:43.280\nthis is more of us this is going to be what do we see when we walk in the front\n\n37:43.280 --> 37:49.040\ndoor of my apartment walls blanket my apartment so there seem to be a few\n\n37:49.040 --> 37:54.480\nthings but not much and the oh oh if I don't sing certain lines it's going to\n\n37:54.480 --> 38:03.920\nbe overtaken by that guy I wanted to hear description of your apartment\n\n38:03.920 --> 38:09.560\nor it's white walls walk through the front door okay welcome there's a welcome\n\n38:09.560 --> 38:15.040\nmat that says welcome I think I'm pretty sure I got on six unit building eight\n\n38:15.040 --> 38:21.840\nthird floor beautiful view of a kind of victory in Hollywood security code to\n\n38:21.840 --> 38:26.360\nget in yeah no it's a gate that doesn't that a certain family keeps breaking so\n\n38:26.360 --> 38:29.960\ntheir kids can get in and out and at this point that I'm done calling the\n\n38:29.960 --> 38:35.880\nlandlord about it it's just easier it's security through obscurity no one's\n\n38:35.880 --> 38:39.480\ngoing to come up to that specific apartment and be like oh well two levels\n\n38:39.480 --> 38:47.160\nthree I'm not bragging about it you can call I had you can come over we\n\n38:47.160 --> 38:52.320\ninvited you in our number three levels have that work well there's a badly\n\n38:52.320 --> 39:00.800\ndesigned there's one that goes down that is so sunken that yeah they have a\n\n39:00.800 --> 39:04.680\nwindow into the other guy's living room if they put another apartment in mine\n\n39:04.680 --> 39:08.640\ndisappears and it goes down to the next line so when we walk into your apartment\n\n39:08.640 --> 39:14.400\nand be honest and I will I will I will I will lower the bar of or raise it as it\n\n39:14.400 --> 39:18.200\nwere of honesty and say there was a when I lived in Hollywood my one bedroom\n\n39:18.200 --> 39:22.760\napartment when I would walk into and you might be a neat freak but right after\n\n39:22.760 --> 39:29.200\nthis is 1999 heat vision and Jack has been not picked up by Fox for whom I am\n\n39:29.200 --> 39:36.280\ncurrently working God bless them for their decisions we're getting some we\n\n39:36.280 --> 39:40.880\nwere getting somewhere this is more than he talks to me ever Jeff you guys\n\n39:40.880 --> 39:45.560\ndon't fight when you walked into my apartment you would see pizza that like\n\n39:45.560 --> 39:49.840\nlike you would be knee-high in pizza boxes there was mannequin legs with\n\n39:49.840 --> 39:55.320\npantyhose on them there there's Mountain Dew to be had I was I was wiping my\n\n39:55.320 --> 40:00.480\nass with t-shirts because I wouldn't go buy toilet paper because I didn't want\n\n40:00.480 --> 40:03.880\npeople at Albertsons to know that heat vision and Jack hadn't been picked up\n\n40:03.880 --> 40:10.480\nfor series can they tell that just by what like oh he's down to bounty heat\n\n40:10.480 --> 40:15.840\nvision and Jack did not get picked up I'm loving this that's an awesome laugh\n\n40:15.840 --> 40:22.240\nhe's laughing God we miss you big red he's buying store up to the Hollywood\n\n40:22.240 --> 40:26.480\nreporters they're trying to see who buys store brand so that's not so so are you\n\n40:26.480 --> 40:29.440\nI mean when I because I wouldn't be surprised by anything if I walked into\n\n40:29.440 --> 40:34.560\nyour apartment what do I see hoarders or do I see like like they can afford to\n\n40:34.560 --> 40:39.680\nhave things this is like oh when's Adam gonna move in this is a nice space which\n\n40:39.680 --> 40:43.680\nis a bad thing to say after 15 months but it's like oh there's some posters that\n\n40:43.680 --> 40:48.000\nprinter new to ink it's more to the point where everything that's going to be in\n\n40:48.000 --> 40:52.360\nthere has been there and it's slowly turning yellow like Miss Haversham's\n\n40:52.360 --> 40:57.120\ndress it's like a wedding cake for a party no one attended dickens right my\n\n40:57.120 --> 41:01.880\nlife what yeah great expectations of that reference what's that you mean the\n\n41:01.880 --> 41:07.880\nwallpaper or the walls are the walls are it's not a bad place to be it's just\n\n41:07.880 --> 41:13.280\nthat there hasn't been any attempts to be able to put more things in there it's\n\n41:13.280 --> 41:18.800\nall dirty is it gets cleanish it has everything in there cleanish that's\n\n41:18.800 --> 41:22.320\nlike saying a little bit pregnant it doesn't add any information but my\n\n41:22.320 --> 41:25.920\napartment is cleanish and a little bit pregnant with the hopes that I might be\n\n41:25.920 --> 41:30.080\nable to buy furniture that was not left on the road somewhere but of all the\n\n41:30.080 --> 41:35.040\npieces that I've seen I picked the cleanliest ones mostly how many bedrooms\n\n41:35.040 --> 41:41.360\none for me one for the roommate oh who's the room she's a beautiful chef named\n\n41:41.360 --> 41:46.280\nAnastasia Davis has she come here I know she works she's the chef at USC her\n\n41:46.280 --> 41:57.680\nname is Anastasia Davis yes Jeff in drag and it's just like that explains all\n\n41:57.680 --> 42:04.000\nthe suits actually and she is really tall it's more that if I were to bring\n\n42:04.000 --> 42:07.920\nher here she'd like I don't think he gets to use that word I think he thinks he\n\n42:07.920 --> 42:12.760\ncan use that word but he can't use that word the n-word yeah oh is she's a\n\n42:12.760 --> 42:22.400\nbleph an African-American chef the second f is for female that's why you've never\n\n42:22.400 --> 42:26.320\nbrought her by because you're racist I can't afford I can't because you thought\n\n42:26.320 --> 42:32.880\nI'm racist that is one untrue and two irrelevant in three I'm not arguing on\n\n42:32.880 --> 42:37.080\nthe first point that's that's we're establishing that bring Anastasia by\n\n42:37.080 --> 42:41.080\nChristmas all right well yeah sounds good we only have a couple more episodes\n\n42:41.080 --> 42:46.280\nrecord before we we leave and like you're living a double life with this\n\n42:46.280 --> 42:52.120\nwoman I by not bringing her to a podcast show her who you are listen to it I put\n\n42:52.120 --> 42:55.160\nit on like you have you listened to Harmontown yet I got some really good\n\n42:55.160 --> 43:00.400\nrejoinders in there and then you talk shit for 15 minutes but it's fine we're\n\n43:00.400 --> 43:08.320\nbuddies all right well any any parting thoughts on the election I'm kidding I\n\n43:08.320 --> 43:12.120\nknow I know I'm gonna I'm gonna self-deport off this stage all right\n\n43:12.120 --> 43:23.800\nwell remember how big red did it don't fucking Woody Woodpecker him man\n\n43:23.800 --> 43:29.080\nJeff did you know

43:42.840\nwoodpecker all right Adam Goldberg came up he's still on stage he's still\n\n43:42.840 --> 43:49.120\nactually okay there you go the audience and I and Jeff and everyone like like\n\n43:49.120 --> 43:53.480\nwe continue to walk the line with Adam Goldberg I don't know what is that line\n\n43:53.480 --> 43:58.360\ndo you think I hear a beleaguered sigh from from that direction like well I mean\n\n43:58.360 --> 44:02.880\nlike we do you we created a monster do you do you love him or do you hate him\n\n44:02.880 --> 44:06.760\nare you honest are you rooting for him are we bullies it certainly doesn't go\n\n44:06.760 --> 44:10.960\nto hate it certainly also doesn't go to love definitely doesn't go to love it's\n\n44:10.960 --> 44:15.080\nI don't know what is it Adam big red I think I I'm ready to love I'm yeah yeah\n\n44:15.080 --> 44:21.200\nno yeah they stand up at my wedding yeah but then maybe in four episodes big\n\n44:21.200 --> 44:25.880\nreds up here

44:34.920\nseems cuddly and yeah he embraces it he it's it seems like what you see is what\n\n44:34.920 --> 44:40.360\nyou get with big red yeah big laugh or big big smile or big big big effusive\n\n44:40.360 --> 44:47.000\nanswers and Adam comes up and people hold their breath yeah he's like a tight\n\n44:47.000 --> 44:50.920\nrope walker and I waiting and then they're like like no one not only do you\n\n44:50.920 --> 44:54.840\nnot know if you're on his side or against him then we start to divide from\n\n44:54.840 --> 44:58.880\neach other right because you guys start going Dan stop stop bringing Adam\n\n44:58.880 --> 45:04.620\nGoldberg up stop saying his name and then I'm like fuck you guys I am I'm\n\n45:04.620 --> 45:10.800\nAdam Goldberg I you are too this is Harmontown we are Adam Goldberg there\n\n45:10.800 --> 45:17.320\nshould be a statue of him outside our city in some ways as a warning\n\n45:17.320 --> 45:24.920\nlet's bring Spencer up right now down show you Spencer Spencer don't use the\n\n45:24.920 --> 45:37.220\ndragons time but also I was gonna bring the guy that's gonna shoot but but\n\n45:37.220 --> 45:42.280\nSpencer can get set up but I do want to check in I think it's important we're\n\n45:42.280 --> 45:44.760\ntaping tonight you might have noticed a video camera they're being very\n\n45:44.760 --> 45:50.440\ninconspicuous and and everything's fine it's no big deal we we have made this\n\n45:50.440 --> 45:54.320\ndecision the the tour dates are not final but they're like I mean this is a\n\n45:54.320 --> 45:58.560\nreal thing we're definitely starting January 10th we're proceeding across the\n\n45:58.560 --> 46:04.120\nnation around the perimeter and we're doing like a you know a three week tour\n\n46:04.120 --> 46:09.680\nof of the nation obviously we're not gonna go everywhere in the nation in three\n\n46:09.680 --> 46:16.120\nweeks because as I've said Harmontown is a it's a it's a catastrophic chaotic\n\n46:16.120 --> 46:21.360\nlike weird thing and every time I try to make something happen it turns to mud\n\n46:21.360 --> 46:25.360\nin my hands and every time we kind of like go with the flow we tend to have a\n\n46:25.360 --> 46:30.160\nlot of fun now that might be an LA thing and we'll be a hipster thing and like\n\n46:30.160 --> 46:34.040\nI'm spaulding gray and I wrote Monster House and so people want to come and\n\n46:34.040 --> 46:37.520\nlisten to me talk and we've boiled down to 50 of you who seem to come every\n\n46:37.520 --> 46:43.340\nweek and maybe maybe that's you know I'm well aware of that possibility we're\n\n46:43.340 --> 46:47.760\ngonna we're gonna proceed to Tempe and we're gonna have a cold bucket of\n\n46:47.760 --> 46:52.840\nreality splashed over us there at our first show there at at Felt's Mound\n\n46:52.840 --> 46:58.760\ncomics and and and Tempe and you know people are gonna be going whoa I thought\n\n46:58.760 --> 47:02.360\nI thought I don't know what a Tempe accent sounds like yes that's pretty good\n\n47:02.360 --> 47:08.520\nI thought you were gonna talk about Danny Pooty I don't know what they would\n\n47:08.520 --> 47:12.200\nhave thought I thought you're gonna have a stand-up act you don't you're a\n\n47:12.200 --> 47:16.040\nterrible rapper and you're dumb and you're fat and you stink your butt stinks\n\n47:16.040 --> 47:20.080\nthe danger is that people are the people that are gonna come see us as we go on\n\n47:20.080 --> 47:23.280\ntour are people that have heard the slightly edited version of our podcast\n\n47:23.280 --> 47:26.480\nright so they're gonna hold us to a higher standard yep you people get the\n\n47:26.480 --> 47:32.800\nreal thought you guys were more compressed I thought it was about an hour 18 why\n\n47:32.800 --> 47:40.400\nis it two hours and filled with you saying edit this out I don't like it I'm\n\n47:40.400 --> 47:50.400\nfrom Tempe I'm a Tempe stereotype I'm Marvin Tempe I go out my front yard and\n\n47:50.400 --> 48:01.120\nI rake it cuz it's gravel and I go to the cactus mines dig up the dig up stones\n\n48:01.120 --> 48:09.760\nand cacti next day they're in Austin Texas whoa I

49:21.400\nand I was drinking and I just inflated a snot bubble out of my nose which hasn't\n\n49:21.400 --> 49:24.880\nhappened since sixth grade it has happened I'm not that cool\n\n49:24.880 -->

49:59.640\ncommunity in some of the health more Jack Nicholson Minnesota well seems the\n\n49:59.640 --> 50:08.800\nDan Harmon's act was curious given his misunderstandings that was misdirected\n\n50:08.800 --> 50:13.960\nassumptions that people in this city would talk like Jack Nicholson he\n\n50:13.960 --> 50:22.120\nought to take that act on the road to to Connery Alabama can we edit the whole\n\n50:22.120 --> 50:28.600\nthing out that fucking stays down all right make it worse Spencer get us up\n\n50:28.600 --> 50:33.960\nto speed last time on the Chronicles of Sharpie and quark our heroes had lost\n\n50:33.960 --> 50:38.760\nLord Butzler hearing rumors of his flight in the night what a fright\n\n50:38.760 --> 50:43.920\nSharpie openly lamented the lack of his party's tracking ability just then they\n\n50:43.920 --> 50:48.440\nrealized an expert tracker had been following them all along conveniently\n\n50:48.440 --> 50:52.360\nthe Kenine Mulraine was standing nearby and united the party struck out in\n\n50:52.360 --> 50:56.480\nsearch of Sharpie's father they immediately lost the trail and in a\n\n50:56.480 --> 51:00.360\ndark moment of

01:08:02.240\nfeel like you could climb out but you aren't as tall as the pit you're still\n\n01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:09.320\ninside now you're giant can I step on the gel the big jello you can attempt to\n\n01:08:09.320 --> 01:08:15.480\nstep on I use my giant enlarge foot and squash the big jello you critically\n\n01:08:15.480 --> 01:08:25.680\nsquash the big jello it's like it's like prices right it flies into pieces the\n\n01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:30.280\nrope is all yours we climb the rope we use the rope to climb out I guess right\n\n01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:38.920\nyou exit the pit right yeah by the sound of that audience applause I detect a\n\n01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:43.600\ntime to stop playing Dungeons & Dragons I feel like they have decided that it's\n\n01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:47.960\ntime to stop I will say this that was a close call yes but I have the feeling\n\n01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:52.000\nthat inside that camp in campmen with the nose we're gonna meet your father\n\n01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:58.440\neither next week or maybe a week after that depending whether or if we push it\n\n01:08:58.440 --> 01:09:05.880\nlong enough we got it we got until 2013 before we go to our Harmontown tour\n\n01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:09.720\nwe're gonna meet Lord butz a lot yeah we'll go find him we'll go yeah yeah\n\n01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:14.920\nbring Tim Curry back and yes we we're gonna I'm gonna say we promise you Tim\n\n01:09:14.920 --> 01:09:20.160\nCurry next Monday no kidding I really want Tim Curry or Julian sands is there\n\n01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:22.800\ntwo people that you hang out with that I don't hang out with them I've met them\n\n01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:27.600\nif you hang out with them more than I do I want my fantasy is to have one of them\n\n01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:37.120\ncome on and read Yelp reviews I want Tim Curry to read Yelp reviews Outback\n\n01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:42.880\nSteakhouse when we arrived on Tuesday we thought it was would be an ordinary\n\n01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:50.640\nsteak we did not know how poorly we'd be treated the service was a party\n\n01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:54.520\nbe great because I think a lot of people that write those Yelp reviews are\n\n01:09:54.520 --> 01:09:59.480\npicturing themselves as Tim Curry kind of like empowered and British thank you\n\n01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:01.520\nSpencer everybody\n\n01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:15.080\nyeah Dan well it's 947 I mean what unless you want from us I don't know we\n\n01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:19.240\ncan wrap this thing up you want to bring a Jesus up oh yeah let's you Jesus come\n\n01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:22.640\non up you sat in the front row anyway you got a satchel\n\n01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:29.320\nJesus what's your last name again Jesus said how do we lose all the\n\n01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:35.480\nmicrophones hi so alright so how feasible is it like those of you you\n\n01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:41.840\nwe've learned in recent episodes you work for a private aeronautics company\n\n01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:45.480\nyeah they launched off in space yeah and people are gonna be buying tickets and\n\n01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:51.920\ngoing up into space mm-hmm like is there any way to like achieve some kind of\n\n01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:58.640\ncoup or I mean well you're not allowed to tell me well like Elon the main guy\n\n01:10:58.640 --> 01:11:04.440\nsuper genius rich guy who runs the whole thing he he just did this whole story\n\n01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:08.440\nwas like yeah we're gonna colonize Mars which is farther than the moon yeah it\n\n01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:13.040\nseems unnecessary and he's like yeah you know get 80,000 people and they'll pay\n\n01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:17.320\nlike 500,000 each it's reasonable and he's don't they have to use the moon as\n\n01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:19.760\na stepping stone or no they're gonna straight tomorrow they don't have to\n\n01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:24.360\nbut I think they should I think they should call it I mean why not yeah it's\n\n01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:29.120\nright there you know so put a gift shop there yeah but double your money casino\n\n01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:34.040\na boat really so mark what okay what is it what marks Mars is a planet and the\n\n01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:38.480\nmoon is a moon yeah what did we find there what what do you think curiosity\n\n01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:42.560\nfound we forget about yet do we know um or like some sort of organic matter I'm\n\n01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:46.600\npretty sure I'm not a hundred percent you know I don't but I think so yeah like\n\n01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:51.720\norganic matter some sort of like worm thing probably warm thing probably some\n\n01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:55.440\nyeah some evidence that something existed there it's some tremors some black\n\n01:11:55.440 --> 01:12:02.320\ngoo couple tremors maybe a couple tremors like three yeah so Mars has an\n\n01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:07.000\natmosphere it's just not as we can actually terraform it yeah terraform it\n\n01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:13.240\nand do all this stuff to it take the terraform Mars you know just a few I\n\n01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:20.640\nhave no idea 20 20 20 minutes 20 minutes on high right yeah yeah I only\n\n01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:25.960\nscanned the article I didn't really like oh there's gonna be tanks of stuff well\n\n01:12:25.960 --> 01:12:32.480\nlook it's 948 or about this clock is I think it's fast I think probably Mars\n\n01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:37.080\nwrap right Mars wrap yeah yeah or do you want it you want to sum up the night\n\n01:12:37.080 --> 01:12:42.240\nwhat are you feeling yeah I just I felt like I wanted to ask hey see something\n\n01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:46.680\nelse like because it seems like maybe we shouldn't be colonizing the moon then\n\n01:12:46.680 --> 01:12:51.160\nit sounds like the powers that be like they know something we don't it's easier\n\n01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:56.760\nto move to Mars at this point you know what I saw on reddit today they they're\n\n01:12:56.760 --> 01:12:59.960\nthere well I mean this won't come to fruition for a while but they're they\n\n01:12:59.960 --> 01:13:04.120\nfigured out faster than light travel let it figure it out but they're there\n\n01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:08.000\nthey close there's something exciting happened there's there's a there's a\n\n01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:12.000\npossible future where they're there they can't kind of have figured it out where\n\n01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:16.960\nyou can create an engine that kind of warps space behind you and then warps\n\n01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:21.240\nspace in front of you and light is only capable of traveling at the speed of\n\n01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:25.920\nlight which you know something's five light years away it takes five years to\n\n01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:31.400\nget there at the speed of light but you can warp space instantly it doesn't you\n\n01:13:31.400 --> 01:13:36.120\ncan warp it faster than the speed of light so like you kind of like there's\n\n01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:42.160\nthese you know conceptual spaceships where you can like create an engine that makes\n\n01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:45.720\nthe spaceship like warp one way and in front of the spaceship work another way\n\n01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:52.800\neffectively like just making this thing just shoot like across space faster than\n\n01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:58.560\nthe speed of light you could get to Alpha Centurion two weeks anyways just a\n\n01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:03.560\nheads up on that one because then you could get to the moon and what I thought\n\n01:14:03.560 --> 01:14:08.560\nI thought I read that it wasn't true really yeah it's like the day that the\n\n01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:12.080\ndata like the test data was but that was like maybe an earlier attempt I'm not\n\n01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:16.600\nsure they also one more thing they just like I saw another thing on Reddit\n\n01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:20.480\nwith Cambridge or something they like launched an official study going like\n\n01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:23.800\nokay for real we have to actually start thinking about whether or not robots are\n\n01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:29.160\ngonna murder all of us I don't think they will because it's such a like weird\n\n01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:32.880\ncommand like how would they come up with that well also they'd have to have this\n\n01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:35.960\nkind of but but one guy said something at the end of the article that kind of\n\n01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:39.920\nstuck with me that that I kind of it's like okay that's the real threat it's\n\n01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:43.680\nlike guys like it's not a question of whether or not robots I love that\n\n01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:47.680\nscientists are forced to talk about this now it's not a question of whether or\n\n01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:51.280\nnot robots will ever have any malicious intent because that's a human thing the\n\n01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:54.000\nwhole point of making robots is like we hate ourselves and we don't want to be\n\n01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:58.120\nmalicious but the big question is whether or not at some point a higher\n\n01:14:58.120 --> 01:15:04.480\nintelligence will will will find us useless you know we'll not you know\n\n01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:08.720\nit's it will have a plan that doesn't involve us like what I think is just\n\n01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:12.040\nwill end up uploading our consciousness onto the internet or something and then\n\n01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:17.800\nwe'll just go along with technology like maybe I mean I don't know Jesus\n\n01:15:17.800 --> 01:15:23.480\nJesus I mean really putting your eggs in a small basket I mean maybe we'll be\n\n01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:27.680\nrunning around like shooting at them with paintball guns I don't know all\n\n01:15:27.680 --> 01:15:31.640\nright so we got robots to worry about that's that's a thing we shouldn't take\n\n01:15:31.640 --> 01:15:36.560\nto Mars with us we may need to rethink the moon colonization maybe maybe go to\n\n01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:39.800\nMars and I kind of feel like if everyone's gonna go to Mars but we're\n\n01:15:39.800 --> 01:15:42.880\nalready in the moon we'll be like the gas station on the way there like you know\n\n01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:48.160\nlike yeah we'll be like we'll be like some outpost on Route 66 yeah we'll be\n\n01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:52.040\nsome quaint little you know a little like little little truck stop on the way\n\n01:15:52.040 --> 01:15:56.880\nto Mars and we'll get milkshakes there there will be a shoneys big red will be\n\n01:15:56.880 --> 01:16:00.560\nthere but you can't terraform the moon I mean you're just gonna you're just\n\n01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:06.320\ntalking about a big like bubble you can it's actually but they're making this\n\n01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:09.840\nother guys like making a machine that can just print buildings and they're\n\n01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:15.280\nsaying it'll be a lot easier when you're in space to just use the material of the\n\n01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:18.960\nactual land and like melt it into iron as opposed to bringing a bunch of like\n\n01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:24.240\nsteel and shit to the planets meaning what that we could just make like a big\n\n01:16:24.240 --> 01:16:28.080\nLogan's city on the moon and it won't matter like we won't have to terraform the\n\n01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:31.680\nmoon we could just have like a yeah you can have like a metal base on top of it\n\n01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:37.760\nand then just like you know basically poop out like houses yeah poop out houses\n\n01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:41.440\nsee I would like that because that speaks to like if you're gonna do that you\n\n01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:44.680\nwould have streets that are just lined up if we're gonna poop out houses we\n\n01:16:44.680 --> 01:16:51.080\nshould bring Daniel Gillies he's the he's the pooper I look forward to an age\n\n01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:56.120\nwhen you go hey where are you I'm gonna where are you hanging out I'm at a 25 oh\n\n01:16:56.120 --> 01:17:01.520\nwell I'm at b3 so I know exactly where I'm gonna go to meet you it would be like\n\n01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:06.320\nx25 z something and then maybe probably like three-dimensional so you'd\n\n01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:10.800\nalso yeah if you need a y value like you're playing Minecraft like like
