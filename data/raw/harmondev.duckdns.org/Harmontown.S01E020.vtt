was no mention of your flesh knife that was the worst that was the worst

03:28.800 --> 03:35.560
knife that that that put me off of myself I was the first among you to

03:35.560 --> 03:39.200
assume that the the threat crossing the threshold be the n-word like that that I

03:39.200 --> 03:44.920
would eventually just go East Coast niggas oh shit sorry no flesh knife is

03:44.920 --> 03:49.960
where I went too far East Coast niggas is forgivable it's part of the style

03:49.960 --> 03:55.160
that's like you know Shakespeare made up a lot of words too obviously there's no

03:55.160 --> 03:58.040
black people in the audience that are gonna go like oh he's talking about me

03:58.040 --> 04:02.600

04:02.600 --> 04:09.560
knife no all races all genders Martians are going gross rowdy the bad person

04:09.560 --> 04:18.040
flesh knife flesh knife I'm right well give you the full report whatever you

04:18.040 --> 04:25.720
want in no necessary order the people say in conversation how are you doing you

04:25.720 --> 04:31.800
don't want an honest answer it's very confusing my my head is incredibly

04:31.800 --> 04:38.320
congested so if I'm speaking too loudly I it's I can't that's what's

04:38.320 --> 04:42.280
happening is like like I everyone got the cold over Thanksgiving right did

04:42.280 --> 04:45.840
everyone get it did anyone not get it is there anyone in the room that didn't get

04:45.840 --> 04:53.120

snot it's just like like this is filled it's almost comforting if I didn't have

05:22.080 --> 05:25.640
to do a show but enough to communicate with anyone I would be kind of you know

05:25.640 --> 05:30.520
it's a cocoon would you say it's kind of an impenetrable like layer of snot up

05:30.520 --> 05:37.920

19:48.520 --> 19:52.160
what it's going to happen to all of us I'm getting increasingly confused by

19:52.160 --> 19:55.480
it by it by everything I still don't know how to use Reddit I've been I've

19:55.480 --> 20:00.560
been lurking for six months like trying I finally worked up the nerve to make

20:00.560 --> 20:03.800
like a little post and like a community thing I thought you gender before I thought

20:03.800 --> 20:08.560
you do you know why do I do those excuse me that's gross I burped I've done

20:08.560 --> 20:13.040
two of the AMAs they ask me any things but that's like a formal those are

20:13.040 --> 20:18.120
even hard to navigate but I'm saying like that community like you know you you

20:18.120 --> 20:21.360
know the idea of you leaving a comment I don't know you know it's a it's a new

20:21.360 --> 20:26.400
environment for an old man so I replied to somebody saying something about

20:26.400 --> 20:32.040
community last night while I was procrastinating writing and and you

20:32.040 --> 20:37.520
could just sense I in my mind it was like oh it's Dan Harmon it's Dan Harmon

25:29.040 --> 25:32.760
Albertsons or a grocery store you got to walk back to the plastic flaps and

25:32.760 --> 25:36.000
there's a place as I like like when you have to pee that bad you suddenly find

25:36.000 --> 25:40.120
out that there's there's pee places and places that you don't associate it looks

25:40.120 --> 25:43.360

25:52.680 --> 25:56.640
half pen but then the pen ran out they finished it with yellow highlighter and

25:56.640 --> 26:01.480
it just kind of it's just barely said out of order and I was like fuck you out

26:01.480 --> 26:09.480

26:09.480 --> 26:15.240
something if they say great a eggs you don't know if you're getting a decent

26:15.240 --> 26:20.280

32:41.200 --> 32:45.160
like okay I want to know how this works so like what do you guys do like pick

32:45.160 --> 32:48.800
it's charge or bull run or do you do like actual battles or no we just

32:48.800 --> 32:51.640
reenact what a battle would look like we don't have enough people to do a real

32:51.640 --> 32:54.640
battle yeah I guess but there's people that do it like they go out there we're

32:54.640 --> 32:58.080
gonna do we're gonna do oh it Gettysburg next year is the 150th and

32:58.080 --> 33:02.560
they're gonna have 30,000 reenactors at Gettysburg yeah and how is that how

33:02.560 --> 33:05.920
close is that to the number that's kind of it's way off but it's the most they're

33:05.920 --> 33:09.600
ever gonna get way off below so they were way below Gettysburg yeah so I

33:09.600 --> 33:13.760
don't know so the civil war is like that that was the we think of World War

33:13.760 --> 33:17.760
2 is like oh we lost so many people no there were 600,000 people killed in the

33:17.760 --> 33:22.320
Civil War yeah that's more than all other American conflicts you can combine

33:22.320 --> 33:26.160
revolutionary to Vietnam and it doesn't equal civil war although they did cheat

33:26.160 --> 33:31.280
as a war by having Americans on both sides that's true yeah asterisk a lot of

33:31.280 --> 33:39.600

36:06.240 --> 36:14.840
quickly Dan no it's gone to red yes thank you like that the first time I was

36:14.840 --> 36:18.440
up here I read your brother's emails three times we had some fun with it I

36:18.440 --> 36:22.360
said a funny quip and we ended the show that was amazing and you won't have me

36:22.360 --> 36:26.280
turn on other audience members I know that that might have been not what you

36:26.280 --> 36:32.360
intended but it certainly was crushing a beer bottle in the back row and here's

36:32.360 --> 36:38.520
what it is I'm always swinging at that baseball you know what happens the best

36:38.520 --> 36:42.240
players if you hit 400 you're one of the best players to ever hit baseball that's

36:42.240 --> 36:46.720
only four and ten yeah I think I'm four point five and ten all right that's why

36:46.720 --> 36:49.760
the one-time guests will always be better than me I think why Fedora will

36:49.760 --> 36:54.200
always be better than me sorry I didn't mean to say your name nobody knows what

36:54.200 --> 37:02.360
you're talking about I'm not jealous I'm not jealous I'm not jealous I'm not

37:02.360 --> 37:10.400
jealous I'm not make a little look at this mic stand you keep the people in

37:10.400 --> 37:14.200
the podcast would realize that the mic stand is like one and a half Adams tall

37:14.200 --> 37:20.160
at this point not jealous that they're they're always exciting people in the

37:20.160 --> 37:24.640
audience in the dose of two and a half minutes but every week I give you a

37:24.640 --> 37:31.320
consistently bad seven and a half minutes and quality quality is eclipsed by

37:31.320 --> 37:40.040
quantity every single time Adam describe your apartment in rap or is this

37:40.040 --> 37:43.280
this is more of us this is going to be what do we see when we walk in the front

37:43.280 --> 37:49.040
door of my apartment walls blanket my apartment so there seem to be a few

37:49.040 --> 37:54.480
things but not much and the oh oh if I don't sing certain lines it's going to

37:54.480 --> 38:03.920
be overtaken by that guy I wanted to hear description of your apartment

38:03.920 --> 38:09.560
or it's white walls walk through the front door okay welcome there's a welcome

38:09.560 --> 38:15.040
mat that says welcome I think I'm pretty sure I got on six unit building eight

38:15.040 --> 38:21.840
third floor beautiful view of a kind of victory in Hollywood security code to

38:21.840 --> 38:26.360
get in yeah no it's a gate that doesn't that a certain family keeps breaking so

38:26.360 --> 38:29.960
their kids can get in and out and at this point that I'm done calling the

38:29.960 --> 38:35.880
landlord about it it's just easier it's security through obscurity no one's

38:35.880 --> 38:39.480
going to come up to that specific apartment and be like oh well two levels

38:39.480 --> 38:47.160
three I'm not bragging about it you can call I had you can come over we

38:47.160 --> 38:52.320
invited you in our number three levels have that work well there's a badly

38:52.320 --> 39:00.800
designed there's one that goes down that is so sunken that yeah they have a

39:00.800 --> 39:04.680
window into the other guy's living room if they put another apartment in mine

39:04.680 --> 39:08.640
disappears and it goes down to the next line so when we walk into your apartment

39:08.640 --> 39:14.400
and be honest and I will I will I will I will lower the bar of or raise it as it

39:14.400 --> 39:18.200
were of honesty and say there was a when I lived in Hollywood my one bedroom

39:18.200 --> 39:22.760
apartment when I would walk into and you might be a neat freak but right after

39:22.760 --> 39:29.200
this is 1999 heat vision and Jack has been not picked up by Fox for whom I am

39:29.200 --> 39:36.280
currently working God bless them for their decisions we're getting some we

39:36.280 --> 39:40.880
were getting somewhere this is more than he talks to me ever Jeff you guys

39:40.880 --> 39:45.560
don't fight when you walked into my apartment you would see pizza that like

39:45.560 --> 39:49.840
like you would be knee-high in pizza boxes there was mannequin legs with

39:49.840 --> 39:55.320
pantyhose on them there there's Mountain Dew to be had I was I was wiping my

39:55.320 --> 40:00.480
ass with t-shirts because I wouldn't go buy toilet paper because I didn't want

40:00.480 --> 40:03.880
people at Albertsons to know that heat vision and Jack hadn't been picked up

40:03.880 --> 40:10.480
for series can they tell that just by what like oh he's down to bounty heat

40:10.480 --> 40:15.840
vision and Jack did not get picked up I'm loving this that's an awesome laugh

40:15.840 --> 40:22.240
he's laughing God we miss you big red he's buying store up to the Hollywood

40:22.240 --> 40:26.480
reporters they're trying to see who buys store brand so that's not so so are you

40:26.480 --> 40:29.440
I mean when I because I wouldn't be surprised by anything if I walked into

40:29.440 --> 40:34.560
your apartment what do I see hoarders or do I see like like they can afford to

40:34.560 --> 40:39.680
have things this is like oh when's Adam gonna move in this is a nice space which

40:39.680 --> 40:43.680
is a bad thing to say after 15 months but it's like oh there's some posters that

40:43.680 --> 40:48.000
printer new to ink it's more to the point where everything that's going to be in

40:48.000 --> 40:52.360
there has been there and it's slowly turning yellow like Miss Haversham's

40:52.360 --> 40:57.120
dress it's like a wedding cake for a party no one attended dickens right my

40:57.120 --> 41:01.880
life what yeah great expectations of that reference what's that you mean the

41:01.880 --> 41:07.880
wallpaper or the walls are the walls are it's not a bad place to be it's just

41:07.880 --> 41:13.280
that there hasn't been any attempts to be able to put more things in there it's

41:13.280 --> 41:18.800
all dirty is it gets cleanish it has everything in there cleanish that's

41:18.800 --> 41:22.320
like saying a little bit pregnant it doesn't add any information but my

41:22.320 --> 41:25.920
apartment is cleanish and a little bit pregnant with the hopes that I might be

41:25.920 --> 41:30.080
able to buy furniture that was not left on the road somewhere but of all the

41:30.080 --> 41:35.040
pieces that I've seen I picked the cleanliest ones mostly how many bedrooms

41:35.040 --> 41:41.360
one for me one for the roommate oh who's the room she's a beautiful chef named

41:41.360 --> 41:46.280
Anastasia Davis has she come here I know she works she's the chef at USC her

41:46.280 --> 41:57.680
name is Anastasia Davis yes Jeff in drag and it's just like that explains all

41:57.680 --> 42:04.000
the suits actually and she is really tall it's more that if I were to bring

42:04.000 --> 42:07.920
her here she'd like I don't think he gets to use that word I think he thinks he

42:07.920 --> 42:12.760
can use that word but he can't use that word the n-word yeah oh is she's a

42:12.760 --> 42:22.400
bleph an African-American chef the second f is for female that's why you've never

42:22.400 --> 42:26.320
brought her by because you're racist I can't afford I can't because you thought

42:26.320 --> 42:32.880
I'm racist that is one untrue and two irrelevant in three I'm not arguing on

42:32.880 --> 42:37.080
the first point that's that's we're establishing that bring Anastasia by

42:37.080 --> 42:41.080
Christmas all right well yeah sounds good we only have a couple more episodes

42:41.080 --> 42:46.280
record before we we leave and like you're living a double life with this

42:46.280 --> 42:52.120
woman I by not bringing her to a podcast show her who you are listen to it I put

42:52.120 --> 42:55.160
it on like you have you listened to Harmontown yet I got some really good

42:55.160 --> 43:00.400
rejoinders in there and then you talk shit for 15 minutes but it's fine we're

43:00.400 --> 43:08.320
buddies all right well any any parting thoughts on the election I'm kidding I

43:08.320 --> 43:12.120
know I know I'm gonna I'm gonna self-deport off this stage all right

43:12.120 --> 43:23.800
well remember how big red did it don't fucking Woody Woodpecker him man

43:23.800 --> 43:29.080
Jeff did you know Pinocchio actually collected a lot of birds no I didn't know

43:29.080 --> 43:32.720
that even had a woodpecker that's Adam Goldberg Adam Goldberg everyone he had a

43:32.720 --> 43:42.840
woodpecker all right Adam Goldberg came up he's still on stage he's still

43:42.840 --> 43:49.120
actually okay there you go the audience and I and Jeff and everyone like like

43:49.120 --> 43:53.480
we continue to walk the line with Adam Goldberg I don't know what is that line

43:53.480 --> 43:58.360
do you think I hear a beleaguered sigh from from that direction like well I mean

43:58.360 --> 44:02.880
like we do you we created a monster do you do you love him or do you hate him

44:02.880 --> 44:06.760
are you honest are you rooting for him are we bullies it certainly doesn't go

44:06.760 --> 44:10.960
to hate it certainly also doesn't go to love definitely doesn't go to love it's

44:10.960 --> 44:15.080
I don't know what is it Adam big red I think I I'm ready to love I'm yeah yeah

44:15.080 --> 44:21.200
no yeah they stand up at my wedding yeah but then maybe in four episodes big

44:21.200 --> 44:25.880
reds up here and like Jesus you might find out but things rarely take a turn

44:25.880 --> 44:30.320
big red don't don't hurt us okay good thank you we love you too big he just

44:30.320 --> 44:34.920
seems cuddly and yeah he embraces it he it's it seems like what you see is what

44:34.920 --> 44:40.360
you get with big red yeah big laugh or big big smile or big big big effusive

44:40.360 --> 44:47.000
answers and Adam comes up and people hold their breath yeah he's like a tight

44:47.000 --> 44:50.920
rope walker and I waiting and then they're like like no one not only do you

44:50.920 --> 44:54.840
not know if you're on his side or against him then we start to divide from

44:54.840 --> 44:58.880
each other right because you guys start going Dan stop stop bringing Adam

44:58.880 --> 45:04.620
Goldberg up stop saying his name and then I'm like fuck you guys I am I'm

45:04.620 --> 45:10.800
Adam Goldberg I you are too this is Harmontown we are Adam Goldberg there

45:10.800 --> 45:17.320
should be a statue of him outside our city in some ways as a warning

45:17.320 --> 45:24.920
let's bring Spencer up right now down show you Spencer Spencer don't use the

45:24.920 --> 45:37.220
dragons time but also I was gonna bring the guy that's gonna shoot but but

45:37.220 --> 45:42.280
Spencer can get set up but I do want to check in I think it's important we're

45:42.280 --> 45:44.760
taping tonight you might have noticed a video camera they're being very

45:44.760 --> 45:50.440
inconspicuous and and everything's fine it's no big deal we we have made this

45:50.440 --> 45:54.320
decision the the tour dates are not final but they're like I mean this is a

45:54.320 --> 45:58.560
real thing we're definitely starting January 10th we're proceeding across the

45:58.560 --> 46:04.120
nation around the perimeter and we're doing like a you know a three week tour

46:04.120 --> 46:09.680
of of the nation obviously we're not gonna go everywhere in the nation in three

46:09.680 --> 46:16.120
weeks because as I've said Harmontown is a it's a it's a catastrophic chaotic

46:16.120 --> 46:21.360
like weird thing and every time I try to make something happen it turns to mud

46:21.360 --> 46:25.360
in my hands and every time we kind of like go with the flow we tend to have a

46:25.360 --> 46:30.160
lot of fun now that might be an LA thing and we'll be a hipster thing and like

46:30.160 --> 46:34.040
I'm spaulding gray and I wrote Monster House and so people want to come and

46:34.040 --> 46:37.520
listen to me talk and we've boiled down to 50 of you who seem to come every

46:37.520 --> 46:43.340
week and maybe maybe that's you know I'm well aware of that possibility we're

46:43.340 --> 46:47.760
gonna we're gonna proceed to Tempe and we're gonna have a cold bucket of

46:47.760 --> 46:52.840
reality splashed over us there at our first show there at at Felt's Mound

46:52.840 --> 46:58.760
comics and and and Tempe and you know people are gonna be going whoa I thought

46:58.760 --> 47:02.360
I thought I don't know what a Tempe accent sounds like yes that's pretty good

47:02.360 --> 47:08.520
I thought you were gonna talk about Danny Pooty I don't know what they would

47:08.520 --> 47:12.200
have thought I thought you're gonna have a stand-up act you don't you're a

47:12.200 --> 47:16.040
terrible rapper and you're dumb and you're fat and you stink your butt stinks

47:16.040 --> 47:20.080
the danger is that people are the people that are gonna come see us as we go on

47:20.080 --> 47:23.280
tour are people that have heard the slightly edited version of our podcast

47:23.280 --> 47:26.480
right so they're gonna hold us to a higher standard yep you people get the

47:26.480 --> 47:32.800
real thought you guys were more compressed I thought it was about an hour 18 why

47:32.800 --> 47:40.400
is it two hours and filled with you saying edit this out I don't like it I'm

47:40.400 --> 47:50.400
from Tempe I'm a Tempe stereotype I'm Marvin Tempe I go out my front yard and

47:50.400 --> 48:01.120
I rake it cuz it's gravel and I go to the cactus mines dig up the dig up stones

48:01.120 --> 48:09.760
and cacti next day they're in Austin Texas whoa I was in Dale's Hills I can't

48:09.760 --> 48:20.560
wait to to to see Dan Harmon before I go and have a Calamari and then on the

48:20.560 --> 48:24.760
Gulf of Mexico wait are you related to Marvin Tempe by the chance well he's my

48:24.760 --> 48:36.520
second brother on the third side two weeks later Boston, Massachusetts the

48:36.520 --> 48:45.680
Dan Harmon show is a wicked retarded no I did not understand it's not as good as

48:45.680 --> 48:56.880
the departed I am from New Orleans came up to Boston for Dan Harmon's show you

48:56.880 --> 49:02.240
should not be using me for your exit poll I am not represented I will skew the

49:02.240 --> 49:16.600
dead I will skew the data Albany, New York I just have a cold and he said that

49:16.600 --> 49:21.400
and I was drinking and I just inflated a snot bubble out of my nose which hasn't

49:21.400 --> 49:24.880
happened since sixth grade it has happened I'm not that cool

49:24.880 --> 49:36.680
over here oh oh oh a muffy let's go to the Dan Harmon show

49:36.680 --> 49:45.640
swallow a bug I didn't understand what he was doing tonight I thought he created

49:45.640 --> 49:59.640
community in some of the health more Jack Nicholson Minnesota well seems the

49:59.640 --> 50:08.800
Dan Harmon's act was curious given his misunderstandings that was misdirected

50:08.800 --> 50:13.960
assumptions that people in this city would talk like Jack Nicholson he

50:13.960 --> 50:22.120
ought to take that act on the road to to Connery Alabama can we edit the whole

50:22.120 --> 50:28.600
thing out that fucking stays down all right make it worse Spencer get us up

50:28.600 --> 50:33.960
to speed last time on the Chronicles of Sharpie and quark our heroes had lost

50:33.960 --> 50:38.760
Lord Butzler hearing rumors of his flight in the night what a fright

50:38.760 --> 50:43.920
Sharpie openly lamented the lack of his party's tracking ability just then they

50:43.920 --> 50:48.440
realized an expert tracker had been following them all along conveniently

50:48.440 --> 50:52.360
the Kenine Mulraine was standing nearby and united the party struck out in

50:52.360 --> 50:56.480
search of Sharpie's father they immediately lost the trail and in a

50:56.480 --> 51:00.360
dark moment of desperation Sharpie managed to tap into forbidden blood

51:00.360 --> 51:05.080
magic casting a spell in the hopes of divining the location of his father

51:05.080 --> 51:09.960
compulsively following the evil spells pole our heroes came upon what appeared

51:09.960 --> 51:17.160
to be a gnoll encampment they hid in the bushes deciding how to proceed unpause

51:17.160 --> 51:23.640
so we've come upon a Noel camp and now I have to look there's no actors playing

51:23.640 --> 51:27.160
my father yeah yeah we were gonna have an act don't worry about it I got this

51:27.160 --> 51:32.240

were outside an encampment of no's of undetermined tribe you're a good

52:03.800 --> 52:07.640
distance off you can see several dwellings made of interlocking bones of

52:07.640 --> 52:11.440
massive proportions perhaps from the skeletons of dragons or perhaps a

52:11.440 --> 52:17.000
titanic frog from the center of the circular park of huts rises smoke and

52:17.000 --> 52:22.880
you can smell the scent of burning meat from even here oh sharpie I'm hungry so

52:22.880 --> 52:28.360
meat I care not for danger let's drive headlong towards the smell of burning

52:28.360 --> 52:34.720

56:17.280 --> 56:23.680
reunite with him you see my name is Yerch and as of the butts alignment with

56:23.680 --> 56:27.960

going you see you're a blackpaw right that's definitely true but they left us

57:09.480 --> 57:12.960
out of some of these negotiations and when he left with those warriors in the

57:12.960 --> 57:17.200
night we had no clue where he was going I I take my sword out and put it towards

57:17.200 --> 57:21.480

all right you useless fucking dick there's more that was just the first

58:22.200 --> 58:28.280
sentence here's it here's a nut continue it appears that the village is on fire

58:28.280 --> 58:33.880
and several slain nulls lie in the streets there's a there's a battle of

58:33.880 --> 58:40.720
foot well any enemy of our enemy is our friend or correct a squirrel of our

58:40.720 --> 58:48.520
white pod null is a black pod null let's go yes you know the squirrel say that

58:48.520 --> 58:53.600
while you're watching the squirrel the note the yurch who was previously under

58:53.600 --> 58:57.800
your blade manages to squirrel himself away and rushes towards the village he

58:57.800 --> 59:04.040
says don't waste any time and mind those traps and he dashes away towards the

59:04.040 --> 59:12.320
village right behind you yurch traps minded do I need to cast any light to

59:12.320 --> 59:15.120
make sure I don't step in a trap or something you don't have any oh I guess

59:15.120 --> 59:18.920
you probably could cast some light but I mean you guys aren't too well versed in

59:18.920 --> 59:24.080
traps to be honest I have a spell for detecting traps hold on I could send a

59:24.080 --> 59:34.760
bunch of squirrels and I summon a murder of squirrels two and a half squirrels

59:34.760 --> 59:44.760
show up that's metric I have a squirrel you see I keep forgetting they always

59:44.760 --> 59:51.560
kill a squirrel when I do that I send squirrels forward in an advanced guard

59:51.560 --> 59:57.200
to detect any traps you send the squirrels forward they run into a small

59:57.200 --> 01:00:02.200
wire that you hadn't previously seen a large bag flies and hits the squirrel in

01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:09.640
the face he's covered in a white powder he stumbles blindly into a bush so we're

01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:23.200
good to go well we should make sure he's okay he basically like a hero until we

01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:29.760
know he's dead we should probably check in with him yeah I examine the squirrels

01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:34.120
condition it appears to be covered in a white powdery substance of unknown

01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:42.240
origin I snort the powder it was just flour what he hit my sack of flour he's

01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:46.560
days but we've tripped the one is we tripped the trap we're good to go well

01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:49.960
what what cool who leaves a trap that's a sack of flour yeah they're heavy they

01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:55.760
can kill a squirrel or at least days they didn't even kill a squirrel huh I'm

01:00:55.760 --> 01:01:00.760

your friends motherfucker as your eyes adjust you can see a lightly colored

01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:26.360
ring on the floor on the opposite sides of the pit it looks like rope next to

01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:32.160
you is a skeleton it appears to have a small patch pouch wedged in its rib cage

01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:37.640
the skeleton is a pouch wedged in his rib cage someone has wedged a pouch into

01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:48.840

01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:03.840

01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:33.800
and pick it up I pluck the pouch from the skeletons it appears to be full of

01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:38.640
some sort of dust or powder it's like what does it look like I snort the looks

01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:48.800

that looked like a rope yeah it's really dark you guys can barely see and see

01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:29.680
there's a light colored ring on the floor well I have some kind of like

01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:33.840
spelled on it probably I think you have light you might have a torch in your

01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:39.280

01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:50.520
cast dancing lights you make several dancing lights hover and float in the

01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:55.600
air you see it is very clearly a rope but there seems to be a shimmering

01:04:55.600 --> 01:05:03.400
border in a cubicle fashion around it just don't get it big red big red

01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:07.560
and it's like a it's like a obviously there's a skeleton down here yeah the

01:05:07.560 --> 01:05:11.240
rope he tried to do that he did he grabbed he did the obvious thing he

01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:15.720
grabbed the rope now he's a skeleton as a result why he has a pouch in his rib

01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:18.840
cage do we need it do we need that pouch we need that pouch right I don't know

01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:28.760
you need it probably yeah it's terrible all right well anybody well yeah but it

01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:34.200
might have poisoned them in any minute everybody throw the powder around it to

01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:39.720
see if like the to see if like the this guy thinks the cube is a force field

01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:42.480
around the rope all right we got a guy in the front row that thinks the cube is

01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:48.680
a force field around the rope what is the powder that I take the

01:05:48.680 --> 01:05:52.640
pouch and I sprinkle the powder on the cubicle or the cube around the thing it

01:05:52.640 --> 01:05:57.040
gives a violent shutter in a terrible shriek it appears to be a gelatinous

01:05:57.040 --> 01:06:02.400
cube an ooze formed into a cube with the sole purpose of engulfing anyone that

01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:16.880
falls near it it lurches forward well it's been a long time since I've said it

01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:28.080
but ray of frost thought that was cooler than it was exactly as cool as they

01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:33.800
responded you let it lunges towards you but you step aside and cast a quick ray

01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:40.280
of frost into its left cubicle side wait we're being we're being attacked by a

01:06:40.280 --> 01:06:45.800
big jello right now yeah well don't turn around and talk to it we should bone

01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:50.440
out yeah we should bone out the frost hits it in the side and does too

01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:55.280
damage to the cube whatever it doesn't seem very I will be more powerful at

01:06:55.280 --> 01:07:03.120
higher levels flaming sword pulling your flaming sword from its sheath you

01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:11.080
strike at the cube you strike the cube a flaming gas appears in its hide and it

01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:16.120
quickly seals itself over with its oozing bulk ship it takes us some damage

01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:28.160
hold up here I oh it takes five damage I have a potion of enlarge person and

01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:34.560

01:07:34.560 --> 01:07:47.240
email I toss it to quark drink it drink this potion of enlarge person snorted I

01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:54.000

01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:30.280
rope is all yours we climb the rope we use the rope to climb out I guess right

01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:38.920
you exit the pit right yeah by the sound of that audience applause I detect a

01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:43.600
time to stop playing Dungeons & Dragons I feel like they have decided that it's

01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:47.960
time to stop I will say this that was a close call yes but I have the feeling

01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:52.000

steak we did not know how poorly we'd be treated the service was a party

01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:54.520

picturing themselves as Tim Curry kind of like empowered and British thank you

01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:01.520

coup or I mean well you're not allowed to tell me well like Elon the main guy

01:10:58.640 --> 01:11:04.440
super genius rich guy who runs the whole thing he he just did this whole story

was like yeah we're gonna colonize Mars which is farther than the moon yeah it

01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:13.040
seems unnecessary and he's like yeah you know get 80,000 people and they'll pay

01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:17.320
like 500,000 each it's reasonable and he's don't they have to use the moon as

01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:19.760
a stepping stone or no they're gonna straight tomorrow they don't have to

01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:24.360
but I think they should I think they should call it I mean why not yeah it's

01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:29.120
right there you know so put a gift shop there yeah but double your money casino

01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:34.040
a boat really so mark what okay what is it what marks Mars is a planet and the

01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:38.480
moon is a moon yeah what did we find there what what do you think curiosity

01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:42.560
found we forget about yet do we know um or like some sort of organic matter I'm

01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:46.600
pretty sure I'm not a hundred percent you know I don't but I think so yeah like

01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:51.720
organic matter some sort of like worm thing probably warm thing probably some

01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:55.440
yeah some evidence that something existed there it's some tremors some black

01:11:55.440 --> 01:12:02.320
goo couple tremors maybe a couple tremors like three yeah so Mars has an

01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:07.000
atmosphere it's just not as we can actually terraform it yeah terraform it

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:13.240
and do all this stuff to it take the terraform Mars you know just a few I

01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:20.640
have no idea 20 20 20 minutes 20 minutes on high right yeah yeah I only

01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:25.960
scanned the article I didn't really like oh there's gonna be tanks of stuff well

01:12:25.960 --> 01:12:32.480
look it's 948 or about this clock is I think it's fast I think probably Mars

01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:37.080
wrap right Mars wrap yeah yeah or do you want it you want to sum up the night

01:12:37.080 --> 01:12:42.240
what are you feeling yeah I just I felt like I wanted to ask hey see something

01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:46.680
else like because it seems like maybe we shouldn't be colonizing the moon then

01:12:46.680 --> 01:12:51.160
it sounds like the powers that be like they know something we don't it's easier

01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:56.760
to move to Mars at this point you know what I saw on reddit today they they're

01:12:56.760 --> 01:12:59.960
there well I mean this won't come to fruition for a while but they're they

01:12:59.960 --> 01:13:04.120
figured out faster than light travel let it figure it out but they're there

01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:08.000
they close there's something exciting happened there's there's a there's a

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:12.000
possible future where they're there they can't kind of have figured it out where

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:16.960
you can create an engine that kind of warps space behind you and then warps

01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:21.240
space in front of you and light is only capable of traveling at the speed of

01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:25.920
light which you know something's five light years away it takes five years to

01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:31.400
get there at the speed of light but you can warp space instantly it doesn't you

01:13:31.400 --> 01:13:36.120
can warp it faster than the speed of light so like you kind of like there's

01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:42.160
these you know conceptual spaceships where you can like create an engine that makes

01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:45.720
the spaceship like warp one way and in front of the spaceship work another way

01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:52.800
effectively like just making this thing just shoot like across space faster than

01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:58.560
the speed of light you could get to Alpha Centurion two weeks anyways just a

01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:03.560
heads up on that one because then you could get to the moon and what I thought

01:14:03.560 --> 01:14:08.560
I thought I read that it wasn't true really yeah it's like the day that the

01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:12.080
data like the test data was but that was like maybe an earlier attempt I'm not

01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:16.600
sure they also one more thing they just like I saw another thing on Reddit

01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:20.480
with Cambridge or something they like launched an official study going like

01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:23.800
okay for real we have to actually start thinking about whether or not robots are

01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:29.160
gonna murder all of us I don't think they will because it's such a like weird

01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:32.880
command like how would they come up with that well also they'd have to have this

01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:35.960
kind of but but one guy said something at the end of the article that kind of

01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:39.920
stuck with me that that I kind of it's like okay that's the real threat it's

01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:43.680
like guys like it's not a question of whether or not robots I love that

01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:47.680
scientists are forced to talk about this now it's not a question of whether or

01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:51.280
not robots will ever have any malicious intent because that's a human thing the

01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:54.000
whole point of making robots is like we hate ourselves and we don't want to be

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:58.120
malicious but the big question is whether or not at some point a higher

01:14:58.120 --> 01:15:04.480
intelligence will will will find us useless you know we'll not you know

01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:08.720
it's it will have a plan that doesn't involve us like what I think is just

01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:12.040
will end up uploading our consciousness onto the internet or something and then

01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:17.800
we'll just go along with technology like maybe I mean I don't know Jesus

01:15:17.800 --> 01:15:23.480
Jesus I mean really putting your eggs in a small basket I mean maybe we'll be

01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:27.680
running around like shooting at them with paintball guns I don't know all

01:15:27.680 --> 01:15:31.640
right so we got robots to worry about that's that's a thing we shouldn't take

01:15:31.640 --> 01:15:36.560
to Mars with us we may need to rethink the moon colonization maybe maybe go to

01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:39.800
Mars and I kind of feel like if everyone's gonna go to Mars but we're

01:15:39.800 --> 01:15:42.880
already in the moon we'll be like the gas station on the way there like you know

01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:48.160
like yeah we'll be like we'll be like some outpost on Route 66 yeah we'll be

01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:52.040
some quaint little you know a little like little little truck stop on the way

01:15:52.040 --> 01:15:56.880
to Mars and we'll get milkshakes there there will be a shoneys big red will be

01:15:56.880 --> 01:16:00.560
there but you can't terraform the moon I mean you're just gonna you're just

01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:06.320
talking about a big like bubble you can it's actually but they're making this

01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:09.840
other guys like making a machine that can just print buildings and they're

01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:15.280
saying it'll be a lot easier when you're in space to just use the material of the

01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:18.960
actual land and like melt it into iron as opposed to bringing a bunch of like

01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:24.240
steel and shit to the planets meaning what that we could just make like a big

01:16:24.240 --> 01:16:28.080
Logan's city on the moon and it won't matter like we won't have to terraform the

01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:31.680
moon we could just have like a yeah you can have like a metal base on top of it

01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:37.760
and then just like you know basically poop out like houses yeah poop out houses

01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:41.440
see I would like that because that speaks to like if you're gonna do that you

01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:44.680
would have streets that are just lined up if we're gonna poop out houses we

01:16:44.680 --> 01:16:51.080
should bring Daniel Gillies he's the he's the pooper I look forward to an age

01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:56.120
when you go hey where are you I'm gonna where are you hanging out I'm at a 25 oh

01:16:56.120 --> 01:17:01.520
well I'm at b3 so I know exactly where I'm gonna go to meet you it would be like

01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:06.320
x25 z something and then maybe probably like three-dimensional so you'd

01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:10.800
also yeah if you need a y value like you're playing Minecraft like like how

01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:16.320
high are you but can I ask a question what you built in Minecraft oh what

01:17:16.320 --> 01:17:19.520
wait what what to be built in Minecraft like something you're proud of I do I do

01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:23.240
a lot of skyscrapers I keep doing it we keep we keep starting over every time

01:17:23.240 --> 01:17:27.800
they come up with an update we keep making new cuz like oh now you can have

01:17:27.800 --> 01:17:32.920
carrots but you now you have to restart the server so I every time I just and it

01:17:32.920 --> 01:17:37.840
takes days I keep making skyscrapers I just make and I have to make them out

01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:43.280
of cooked stone I can't make them out of cobblestone which means that I could go

01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:48.000
on about this I as it's a it's a it's a compulsion for me I make these like big

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:56.080
gray towers like a like an evil person

01:17:56.360 --> 01:18:12.320
all right I give you two choices you can take you can see yes well that's

01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:17.960
about all the time we got but I think you know what time it is
