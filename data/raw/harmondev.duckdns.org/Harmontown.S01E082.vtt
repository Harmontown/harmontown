Hello from Meltdown Comics, from NerdMelt Media in Hollywood, California, Harmontown

00:17.960 --> 00:18.960
is now in session.

00:18.960 --> 00:34.360
Welcome to the stage of the Mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.

00:34.360 --> 00:35.360
Happy Thanksgiving!

00:35.360 --> 00:38.880
Thank you for making the drive and the treacherous traffic.

00:38.880 --> 00:41.480
Good for you, good for you folks.

00:41.480 --> 00:45.600
So there was some kind of parade or something in LA, right?

00:45.600 --> 00:46.600
Was it the Christmas parade?

00:46.600 --> 00:47.600
Yes, yeah.

00:47.600 --> 00:48.600
Really?

00:48.600 --> 00:49.600
That's a big parade.

00:49.600 --> 00:50.600
It's a bummer, though.

00:50.600 --> 00:51.600
Have you been to it?

00:51.600 --> 00:52.600
No, no.

00:52.600 --> 00:53.600
It's not a good parade.

00:53.600 --> 00:54.600
I assume it's a...

00:54.600 --> 00:56.600
No parade is a good parade.

00:56.600 --> 00:57.600
Not anyway.

00:57.600 --> 01:02.600
I saw the Macy's Day one on TV.

01:02.600 --> 01:07.600
Ronald McDonald was just scraping his belly along the...

01:07.600 --> 01:08.600
Broadway.

01:08.600 --> 01:12.800
I don't know if there was a golden age of the Macy's Day parade when it was like, oh,

01:12.800 --> 01:15.600
each float is a cultural masterpiece or something.

01:15.600 --> 01:20.000
It just happens in Hong Kong Fooies in there, too, but I think it was probably always a

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
commercial jerk-off.

01:23.000 --> 01:28.600
It was probably all pretty capitalistic in nature, but boy, howdy.

01:28.600 --> 01:32.880
With the floats and then they just stop and this was weird, silent boulevard and some

01:32.880 --> 01:38.240
kid in a snow jacket does a break dance and they just, the announcers are just going like,

01:38.240 --> 01:42.960
there's the buttermilk cracker float, buttermilk crackers that Santa's workshop, the crackers

01:42.960 --> 01:48.520
go down the chimney and out to all the boys and girls and there's Alonzo Mosley.

01:48.520 --> 01:52.520
The star of...

01:52.520 --> 01:59.080
The character from Midnight Run that the outfit Kodo played.

01:59.080 --> 02:02.320
In point of fact is who I just named.

02:02.320 --> 02:04.000
That's where my brain...

02:04.000 --> 02:05.960
Were he in Hong Kong Fooie in the same parade?

02:05.960 --> 02:09.600
Do you want to tell people who Hong Kong Fooie is in case they don't know?

02:09.600 --> 02:10.600
Hey, what's up?

02:10.600 --> 02:12.040
Look, I didn't even know who the hell he was.

02:12.040 --> 02:15.880
I only ever knew who Hong Kong Fooie was from the Macy's parade.

02:15.880 --> 02:16.880
It would be the...

02:16.880 --> 02:19.960
It was that hold-on float.

02:19.960 --> 02:23.440
I don't know if there was still a Hong Kong Fooie, but there was a Pokemon and there was

02:23.440 --> 02:27.440
a Pikachu and there was a...

02:27.440 --> 02:28.440
The last thing I was...

02:28.440 --> 02:32.400
Because it was playing in the hotel in Florida and the last thing on the feed in Florida

02:32.400 --> 02:34.160
was Santa Claus.

02:34.160 --> 02:35.160
I guess that's how they end.

02:35.160 --> 02:41.400
The guy goes, and as always, the end of all the Thanksgiving parades, there's Santa Claus.

02:41.400 --> 02:47.480
Boy, it's great to see him, and as all the kids get on top of the parents, straining

02:47.480 --> 02:48.480
commercial.

02:48.480 --> 02:51.480
That was really funny.

02:51.480 --> 02:57.880
Look, there's a kid that you just left with the image of kids on top of parents straining.

02:57.880 --> 03:00.360
Anyways, whatever it was.

03:00.360 --> 03:02.200
But normally it's the other way around.

03:02.200 --> 03:06.200
Yeah, usually the parents strain on top of the kids.

03:06.200 --> 03:07.200
Yeah.

03:07.200 --> 03:10.200
It was funny.

03:10.200 --> 03:15.200
In Purve Land.

03:15.200 --> 03:16.200
Yeah.

03:16.200 --> 03:23.400
Is that Lorraine Newman's husband?

03:23.400 --> 03:32.080
He's like a weird version of Commander Pike from Star Trek.

03:32.080 --> 03:34.280
He's got only a couple buttons on his...

03:34.280 --> 03:36.280
All right.

03:36.280 --> 03:42.840
I see the writing on the wall, I'm not the most facile tonight.

03:42.840 --> 03:44.880
That's why we should bring up our amazing friends.

03:44.880 --> 03:45.880
What?

03:45.880 --> 03:47.960
I'm under the weather right now, so I'm in another world.

03:47.960 --> 03:53.160
Let's put the onus on the bonus.

03:53.160 --> 03:55.600
Let's show biz talk for...

03:55.600 --> 03:58.280
Let's hinge the show on our special guests.

03:58.280 --> 04:01.160
Let's put the onus on the bonus.

04:01.160 --> 04:05.680
It's an old show biz term.

04:05.680 --> 04:08.040
Let's put the onus on the bonus.

04:08.040 --> 04:09.800
Don't tell me you've never heard that phrase.

04:09.800 --> 04:12.720
Well, I know what the onus is.

04:12.720 --> 04:15.880
It's on the bonus, but they don't know who the bonus is.

04:15.880 --> 04:20.880
Well, I tweeted what the bonus was, and he did make it.

04:20.880 --> 04:28.800
Please welcome my impish, quixotic, energetic, incredible, genius, intimidating, delightful

04:28.800 --> 04:35.800
friend, Mitch Hurwitz, to the stage.

04:35.800 --> 04:48.600
Have any seat you like, do whatever you like, with them.

04:48.600 --> 04:49.600
Okay, go ahead.

04:49.600 --> 04:50.600
Sit off there.

04:50.600 --> 04:51.600
It doesn't matter.

04:51.600 --> 04:52.600
Yeah.

04:52.600 --> 04:53.600
Mitch Hurwitz.

04:53.600 --> 04:54.600
All right.

04:54.600 --> 04:58.080
There's a mic in there.

04:58.080 --> 05:02.840
That was the thing that your anus was on.

05:02.840 --> 05:03.840
So, yeah.

05:03.840 --> 05:04.840
Dan.

05:04.840 --> 05:10.800
First of all, I can tell you, you have never seen an artist prepare the way Dan does backstage.

05:10.800 --> 05:12.800
Can I lift the veil a little bit?

05:12.800 --> 05:13.800
Sure, sure, sure.

05:13.800 --> 05:18.360
It gets here at like four in the afternoon, and it's calisthenics, and then newspaper

05:18.360 --> 05:19.360
after newspaper.

05:19.360 --> 05:22.880
It's unbelievable to see your process.

05:22.880 --> 05:26.160
Yeah, I look for funny ads.

05:26.160 --> 05:27.160
And then the grooming.

05:27.160 --> 05:32.320
I mean, the grooming, which I'd heard about, you had only heard about.

05:32.320 --> 05:33.320
I'm so, I truly am.

05:33.320 --> 05:35.480
Dan wakes up, actually, he doesn't wake up.

05:35.480 --> 05:38.760
He wakes up at 6 a.m., as you know, and gets straight to work and starts writing community

05:38.760 --> 05:40.640
by 7 at Paramount.

05:40.640 --> 05:41.640
Right, yeah.

05:41.640 --> 05:44.600
But at 4.30, while he's still asleep, a team of Korean women come in and groom him in

05:44.600 --> 05:45.600
his sleep.

05:45.600 --> 05:49.840
That's why every year is always, and punch up.

05:49.840 --> 05:50.840
Yep.

05:50.840 --> 05:56.080
No, but I really admire, I make this joke as a statement of admiration, because your

05:56.080 --> 05:57.960
process is so effortless.

05:57.960 --> 06:01.280
It just comes out, honestly, my process is really tortured.

06:01.280 --> 06:03.280
Like, do you want to see me try to think of a joke?

06:03.280 --> 06:04.280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:04.280 --> 06:06.000
Tell me one about a caterpillar.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
Oh, okay.

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
See what I mean?

06:10.000 --> 06:14.560
It's just not, it's not like you're, it's too much.

06:14.560 --> 06:15.560
Dan, show me your process.

06:15.560 --> 06:16.560
It doesn't podcast.

06:16.560 --> 06:17.560
Hey, guy walks in a bar, rape!

06:17.560 --> 06:18.560
See, I don't, yeah.

06:18.560 --> 06:30.120
It's, I'm sure it was everybody, what, thanks for coming Mitch, so whatever comes out of

06:30.120 --> 06:31.120
my mouth.

06:31.120 --> 06:34.120
Your band is amazing too, they're so cute.

06:34.120 --> 06:37.920
Uh, the band is good.

06:37.920 --> 06:43.640
Um, so, so I went, speaking of work ethic, uh, I wanted to ask you about your days at

06:43.640 --> 06:48.400
Fox working on Arrested Development, world's smartest company.

06:48.400 --> 06:51.840
Would you like there to be no more Arrested Development, we could just speak candidly?

06:51.840 --> 06:54.360
Uh, no, I wouldn't like there to be, yeah.

06:54.360 --> 06:57.320
Because that might be the result of me speaking candidly.

06:57.320 --> 06:58.320
No, no, no.

06:58.320 --> 07:00.560
I think our situations were pretty similar.

07:00.560 --> 07:01.560
I do.

07:01.560 --> 07:08.320
I think I, I created a more of a, you know, a sort of a polished social exterior than

07:08.320 --> 07:14.440
you did, but I feel like, but I didn't have to work with Chevy Chase.

07:14.440 --> 07:15.440
Right.

07:15.440 --> 07:21.280
But you did have to work, I've heard, I've heard backstage gossips and murmurs.

07:21.280 --> 07:28.000
Your family was no easy, uh, they weren't like a, like communities blessed with a bunch

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
of people.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
Except for Joel.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
I know they're amazing.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
Yeah.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.480
Joel is a bit of a bitter pill to have to swallow.

07:34.480 --> 07:36.960
And there's a girl named Gillian, did you know that?

07:36.960 --> 07:37.960
Yeah.

07:37.960 --> 07:43.080
She's, she's, she's, she will throw a tantrum if you pronounce the G wrong and she throws

07:43.080 --> 07:47.200
hardcover books around that she, that she, she only bought cause you heard about him

07:47.200 --> 07:52.480
on NPR and she, she got him cause of the hardness of the cover cause she wants to throw him

07:52.480 --> 07:53.480
at people.

07:53.480 --> 07:58.200
And if that is, uh, let's just say drinking and let's just say gambling and let's just

07:58.200 --> 08:04.360
say violence and let's, I got to spend a few days over there and, uh, they really were

08:04.360 --> 08:05.360
amazing.

08:05.360 --> 08:06.360
Yeah.

08:06.360 --> 08:07.360
And they lionize you.

08:07.360 --> 08:08.360
Yeah.

08:08.360 --> 08:09.360
What is that?

08:09.360 --> 08:19.640
When you compare someone to a lion, uh, whatever that is they do to you, I love you like, oh,

08:19.640 --> 08:20.640
here comes Dan.

08:20.640 --> 08:21.640
He could smell their red meat.

08:21.640 --> 08:22.640
He kissed the lion.

08:22.640 --> 08:23.640
Like, oh, they're lionized.

08:23.640 --> 08:27.600
I'm absolutely positive that it's no exaggeration that you spent more time with them than I

08:27.600 --> 08:30.200
did the whole 13 episodes because I doubt it.

08:30.200 --> 08:34.800
I hope that they understand that, that I, that that means that, that what I do, that

08:34.800 --> 08:40.240
the footsteps aren't there cause I was, uh, masturbating in the bushes.

08:40.240 --> 08:41.240
Yeah.

08:41.240 --> 08:44.880
I mean, I think they know, uh, but I don't know.

08:44.880 --> 08:47.920
They, they really, they all admire you and I do think it's because they haven't spent

08:47.920 --> 08:50.920
much time with you.

08:50.920 --> 08:53.800
No, they really, they're all so proud.

08:53.800 --> 08:57.360
They're incredibly proud as they should be to be on such a great creative show.

08:57.360 --> 09:00.480
And the one that, that I got to sit in on was no exception.

09:00.480 --> 09:01.480
It's so out there.

09:01.480 --> 09:02.480
It's so creative.

09:02.480 --> 09:03.480
It's unbelievable.

09:03.480 --> 09:07.800
I went to the set and I really, there was like a big chasm between like, you could tell

09:07.800 --> 09:11.240
they thought, oh, this is like a show creator guy, a guy can give us jobs and everything.

09:11.240 --> 09:14.480
And by the end they really started to see me more as an equal.

09:14.480 --> 09:16.160
So I got the hell out of there.

09:16.160 --> 09:17.160
Yeah.

09:17.160 --> 09:18.160
That's good.

09:18.160 --> 09:19.160
You had the luxury.

09:19.160 --> 09:20.160
Yeah.

09:20.160 --> 09:21.160
That was a close one.

09:21.160 --> 09:24.960
And your, your, your bit was, uh, was, was amazing at everything that Schrab, Schrab cut

09:24.960 --> 09:25.960
together.

09:25.960 --> 09:26.960
It's really fun.

09:26.960 --> 09:29.240
But no, I have to say, actually like, like your cast, our cast was great.

09:29.240 --> 09:30.240
They're wonderful.

09:30.240 --> 09:31.240
But they hated each other.

09:31.240 --> 09:32.240
Some of them.

09:32.240 --> 09:34.960
And they just functioned truly as a family in a great way.

09:34.960 --> 09:38.840
You know, we had like a couple of leading men as brothers and there was a lot of stuff

09:38.840 --> 09:40.720
going on there and they loved each other.

09:40.720 --> 09:43.320
They were, and they, you know, competed.

09:43.320 --> 09:46.880
And, uh, but for me, the challenge, it was always, you know, Fox, it was always dealing

09:46.880 --> 09:47.880
with the network.

09:47.880 --> 09:48.960
It was all the same stuff you do.

09:48.960 --> 09:53.880
But as far as what I found out this season, because, and I'm, I'm an honest person because

09:53.880 --> 09:58.240
these people, once they fire you and bring you back, not because they respect you, but

09:58.240 --> 10:02.760
because if they brought you back, it's because they don't give a shit anymore.

10:02.760 --> 10:06.560
For that reason, I have been left to my own devices and I have truly found that I was

10:06.560 --> 10:07.560
always the problem.

10:07.560 --> 10:13.040
Well, in some of your devices, I've seen a couple of the devices.

10:13.040 --> 10:14.040
Yeah.

10:14.040 --> 10:16.560
Well, left to my own actual self-build devices.

10:16.560 --> 10:17.560
Yeah.

10:17.560 --> 10:18.560
It's really offensive.

10:18.560 --> 10:25.240
I'm, I'm, I'm the Steve Jobs of, of, of Cronenbergian, uh, uh, acting in Blitz.

10:25.240 --> 10:32.080
Yeah, yeah, I have a, I have a fake twin that, that, uh, that I invented a lot of weird,

10:32.080 --> 10:37.880
curvy, uh, alien tailbone looking things that I, I claim helped you act.

10:37.880 --> 10:41.720
Um, there's a table full of them and they're all flecked with, uh, fluids.

10:41.720 --> 10:45.480
No, but the amazing thing about this Sony, about your situation at Sony, because I know

10:45.480 --> 10:48.680
they haven't been around this year.

10:48.680 --> 10:51.080
And I don't think it's because of that whale bone thing.

10:51.080 --> 10:56.040
I think it's, I, I think it's, it's that, I think they, I've always thought in television

10:56.040 --> 10:59.240
they want you to push them out of it.

10:59.240 --> 11:00.240
Really?

11:00.240 --> 11:01.240
Yeah.

11:01.240 --> 11:04.520
I mean, the whole says they want to be able to say, well, yeah, maybe that's it.

11:04.520 --> 11:07.760
They don't want to be accountable, but also, you know, they know the only hits that have

11:07.760 --> 11:11.520
ever come for them are the ones where the guy said, fuck you, we're not doing it your

11:11.520 --> 11:12.520
way.

11:12.520 --> 11:13.520
But that's, that's too selfless.

11:13.520 --> 11:14.680
I don't believe that they're that selfless.

11:14.680 --> 11:17.840
That's why they're, they're still putting in their, their whole system where they've

11:17.840 --> 11:20.880
got all these checks and balances and then it takes somebody to come along and say, you

11:20.880 --> 11:22.840
know, on the Simpsons, they don't give notes.

11:22.840 --> 11:23.840
Right.

11:23.840 --> 11:27.080
But those are all, those are all money-making things and they never left you alone until

11:27.080 --> 11:32.360
you, you, you're, there, I mean, you and I were, we share, we're on the Simeon branch

11:32.360 --> 11:34.520
that is the low-rated great ape.

11:34.520 --> 11:35.520
Yeah.

11:35.520 --> 11:36.520
Yeah.

11:36.520 --> 11:39.520
We had no tail.

11:39.520 --> 11:42.440
It's called the not, the non-wealthy ape.

11:42.440 --> 11:45.480
It's the one branch of the ape that didn't become super wealthy.

11:45.480 --> 11:50.520
But, but, but, but you, like the last temptation to Christ, the guys put up on the cross, what's

11:50.520 --> 11:51.520
his name?

11:51.520 --> 11:52.520
Uh, Christ.

11:52.520 --> 12:05.800
And, uh, he read for Michael Bluth, but everything was so on the nose, it was so overstated.

12:05.800 --> 12:10.040
For a moment you get to see, like, like, like Christ is up there on the cross and you get,

12:10.040 --> 12:13.920
I think that's the conceit of that movie and book and whatever, is that for a moment you

12:13.920 --> 12:18.440
get to see, okay, it's all fine and well to know that the guy got put up there and forgive

12:18.440 --> 12:21.320
him God, they don't know what they're doing and all that stuff.

12:21.320 --> 12:25.240
But for a moment in that story, what you get to explore and see is, okay, what if he had

12:25.240 --> 12:31.000
said in a moment of, of passion, a moment of selfishness, all right, time out, forget

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
it.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
I don't want to be Jesus ever again.

12:33.000 --> 12:36.960
Uh, and you get to see that it would have sucked that, that, that, that in the long run

12:36.960 --> 12:37.960
it would have been shitty.

12:37.960 --> 12:42.320
I feel like, like, like politically, season five, they, they, like they said, okay, what

12:42.320 --> 12:46.280
if we did leave you alone, you preening, whining fucker?

12:46.280 --> 12:50.880
And the truth is we all, like, like, like I am my own worst enemy, like I will stay

12:50.880 --> 12:56.040
at that office until that, that the script is supposedly perfect, but it, it, it ain't

12:56.040 --> 12:57.040
ever perfect.

12:57.040 --> 13:01.320
Like Dan, you're saying that you're not getting any, like, uh, any trouble from the, uh, from

13:01.320 --> 13:02.320
the Mucky Mucks?

13:02.320 --> 13:04.800
They're not, they're not, they're not making my life difficult at all.

13:04.800 --> 13:05.800
No.

13:05.800 --> 13:06.800
No.

13:06.800 --> 13:07.800
You lose something to rebel against.

13:07.800 --> 13:09.160
I mean, that is part of it.

13:09.160 --> 13:12.540
Part of it is you want to kind of stoke the, the fires of that anger a little bit.

13:12.540 --> 13:15.840
We did a thing in the last season where we had a Google car, you know, that was going

13:15.840 --> 13:20.000
to be that, like the funny vehicle, cause I'm all for just anything else funny.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.200
You can get in there, get it in there.

13:22.200 --> 13:25.480
So, and every once we were in a parking lot, there were all these like air conditioning

13:25.480 --> 13:31.080
trucks and Jim Valley said to me, look, season six, everybody's got a funny car.

13:31.080 --> 13:35.520
But, uh, so we had Jason driving the Google car and it was just not that funny.

13:35.520 --> 13:37.400
And then we heard the Google wouldn't let us use it.

13:37.400 --> 13:39.640
We were like, yes, we have a point of view now.

13:39.640 --> 13:40.640
Right.

13:40.640 --> 13:41.640
You know, I get to be mad at something.

13:41.640 --> 13:42.640
Yeah.

13:42.640 --> 13:43.640
We're mad at it.

13:43.640 --> 13:44.640
And I think that's part of.

13:44.640 --> 13:46.280
The oppositional defiant disorder.

13:46.280 --> 13:47.280
Yes.

13:47.280 --> 13:50.080
It's, it's, it's like, it's like someone's, someone's going to make me mad.

13:50.080 --> 13:53.960
We brought, we brought, we brought, uh, some integrated marketing into as we've done to

13:53.960 --> 13:56.960
great success in the past and they're, they're really cool.

13:56.960 --> 14:02.360
And then they, and then they said that they, uh, well, we never, uh, we never call that

14:02.360 --> 14:03.360
that.

14:03.360 --> 14:04.360
And I was like, yes.

14:04.360 --> 14:05.360
And I was like, now I know what the scene's about.

14:05.360 --> 14:08.320
Well, we are calling it a filet of fish sandwich now, my friend.

14:08.320 --> 14:10.600
Or now the scene's about how you don't call it that.

14:10.600 --> 14:12.600
Now how you like me.

14:12.600 --> 14:17.620
And I really, that really made me step back and go, is that your whole stick waiting around

14:17.620 --> 14:19.120
to be told what not to do?

14:19.120 --> 14:21.400
And then you talk about how you can't do it.

14:21.400 --> 14:24.280
Like, like, you know, there's always something to be outraged about, right?

14:24.280 --> 14:29.720
And I think like, I remember we did this, this ninth or the 10th episode of, of the third

14:29.720 --> 14:30.720
season.

14:30.720 --> 14:31.880
It was the first time we'd really gone super meta.

14:31.880 --> 14:36.640
We'd done kind of things like that, but, um, we had no point of view in the show.

14:36.640 --> 14:38.920
It was just something, nothing tied together.

14:38.920 --> 14:42.080
Like the kid was going to a private school and they were throwing a dinner.

14:42.080 --> 14:44.000
It was just nothing.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
And then I got a call saying, you're canceled.

14:46.000 --> 14:50.080
It was like, best thing that ever happened, a show nine.

14:50.080 --> 14:52.920
And that was the one that we were, they were making all these comments about, you know,

14:52.920 --> 14:54.880
now there's going to be 3d segments and all that stuff.

14:54.880 --> 14:55.880
It feels a little trite now.

14:55.880 --> 14:56.880
I did.

14:56.880 --> 14:57.880
I did.

14:57.880 --> 15:03.440
We did an episode this year where I wrote it in anger, uh, in like six hours, uh, out

15:03.440 --> 15:04.440
of sarcasm.

15:04.440 --> 15:05.560
I know what that is.

15:05.560 --> 15:11.800
I read, I read something online that was somebody saying something and I was like, I know this

15:11.800 --> 15:12.800
is fucking.

15:12.800 --> 15:13.800
You want to, you want to see this shit?

15:13.800 --> 15:14.800
Fuck it.

15:14.800 --> 15:15.800
Fuck it.

15:15.800 --> 15:20.600
And it's probably, it's really one of the better episodes of the season.

15:20.600 --> 15:24.480
It's me going, yeah, everyone want to go home by six, fine, you're going home by six.

15:24.480 --> 15:25.720
See how good the show is.

15:25.720 --> 15:28.880
And that's, it's fine.

15:28.880 --> 15:29.880
Fine episode.

15:29.880 --> 15:31.880
A story, B story.

15:31.880 --> 15:32.880
I get it.

15:32.880 --> 15:35.880
A couple of jokes for Mitch.

15:35.880 --> 15:40.080
Dan or Mitch, uh, I'll start with Dan, like what, what, what, what's been the recipe like

15:40.080 --> 15:42.680
climate wise for the worst episode of the season?

15:42.680 --> 15:51.840
Like, uh, definitely without a doubt, it's, it's, it's knowing in advance what that you

15:51.840 --> 15:59.160
want to do X. Now, uh, uh, you know, in the past that's some of the episodes are that,

15:59.160 --> 16:05.360
that's always, that can generate your best episode knowing that you want to do, it's

16:05.360 --> 16:14.000
going to be a blank episode, um, but it without a doubt, when you are up at four AM on a Sunday,

16:14.000 --> 16:17.160
when the call time is seven AM Monday and you're writing the scene and no one knows

16:17.160 --> 16:21.760
what the fuck is going on, the reason for the trouble starts with someone saying, we

16:21.760 --> 16:24.120
have to do a Dungeons and Dragons sequel.

16:24.120 --> 16:26.360
We have to do a zombie Halloween.

16:26.360 --> 16:31.600
We have to do Christmas is going to be this because it's not organic and it's, it's,

16:31.600 --> 16:34.480
yeah, well it's kind of like knowing what your theme is ahead of time.

16:34.480 --> 16:35.480
And you'll see people.

16:35.480 --> 16:42.920
You'll see, you think Ryan Murphy listens to this show and he's like, oh, these are

16:42.920 --> 16:43.920
some good pointers.

16:43.920 --> 16:47.560
I'm going to use that one for American Horror Story.

16:47.560 --> 16:49.880
I just picture him as having an Irish accent.

16:49.880 --> 16:51.880
I'm Ryan Murphy.

16:51.880 --> 16:56.040
I like to make the nice TV shows for the nice people.

16:56.040 --> 17:00.040
Oh, I just, my experience of it seems like a very nice guy.

17:00.040 --> 17:16.680
I don't want to talk about him.

17:16.680 --> 17:17.680
He shoots it.

17:17.680 --> 17:22.040
But I would, I remember, he would say things when he was doing a nip talk and talk about

17:22.040 --> 17:27.480
how, you know, I want to do a show about superficiality and about how people are as only as deep

17:27.480 --> 17:28.480
as their skin.

17:28.480 --> 17:30.160
I know you didn't.

17:30.160 --> 17:36.000
You came up with that at some point, but it is whenever you start off.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.840
It's always a lie what you're starting with.

17:37.840 --> 17:40.520
I mean, it's, it's what I was just praising you about, about this show.

17:40.520 --> 17:45.760
Like I see you figure out your point as you're making it, which I really admire because otherwise

17:45.760 --> 17:46.760
you're kind of full of shit.

17:46.760 --> 17:49.280
You're going in with an idea, what you want to say already.

17:49.280 --> 17:50.280
And I don't know.

17:50.280 --> 17:55.000
I remember pitching arrested and saying the concept was going to be it's about a family

17:55.000 --> 17:59.120
that loses everything and is much happier because of it.

17:59.120 --> 18:01.680
And none of that happened.

18:01.680 --> 18:04.640
They didn't, they didn't really lose that much.

18:04.640 --> 18:13.880
They just sat around and stayed quasi rich, but very witty, the funniest family in the

18:13.880 --> 18:14.880
world.

18:14.880 --> 18:16.400
Yeah, they're really funny.

18:16.400 --> 18:18.120
The material possession ever.

18:18.120 --> 18:19.120
Yeah.

18:19.120 --> 18:22.440
And it really was the idea of like, you know, I said, oh, you know, the husband and wife

18:22.440 --> 18:25.200
that haven't been sharing a bedroom, they're now going to have to share a bedroom and there's

18:25.200 --> 18:26.600
all these sort of family values.

18:26.600 --> 18:30.160
And then the first like three episodes that got thrown at my face a lot, aren't they supposed

18:30.160 --> 18:31.160
to learn that it's better?

18:31.160 --> 18:32.160
Oh, yeah.

18:32.160 --> 18:33.160
No, I'm building to it.

18:33.160 --> 18:34.160
They're going to learn it's better.

18:34.160 --> 18:35.160
They're going to learn it's much better.

18:35.160 --> 18:42.560
We had to put our, our post super, but didn't you, didn't you work with Jay Gost?

18:42.560 --> 18:43.560
Yeah.

18:43.560 --> 18:44.560
On a one show.

18:44.560 --> 18:48.520
And not on a, doing the last couple episodes of season three, there was a point because

18:48.520 --> 18:50.040
it was like, well, how did season three end?

18:50.040 --> 18:56.040
Chang was dressed as Napoleon and there was a dragon in the sky and Abbott's head was

18:56.040 --> 18:57.040
the sun.

18:57.040 --> 18:58.040
I don't know.

18:58.040 --> 19:00.040
It's just the college, the community college experience.

19:00.040 --> 19:01.040
Yeah.

19:01.040 --> 19:05.760
I'm sound mixing it with Jay and I was like, Jay, could you think is there a way we can

19:05.760 --> 19:10.040
get, go to some kind of Japanese anime library and find some kind of something that sounds

19:10.040 --> 19:13.840
like a light sword, but also can we mix it because it needs to be funny to it needs to

19:13.840 --> 19:19.360
be an ironic take like an ersatz light sword sounds Japanese, but it needs to be like the

19:19.360 --> 19:23.120
Americanized version because it's a Jeff's imagination and something, something like

19:23.120 --> 19:24.120
that.

19:24.120 --> 19:30.440
And Jay Gost said, I signed on to a show about people going to a community college.

19:30.440 --> 19:34.120
He was, he was being ironic of course.

19:34.120 --> 19:36.360
He's a good sport, but yeah.

19:36.360 --> 19:42.440
But, but, but I'm, I'm, I was curious like, like how, when you're, when you're surfing

19:42.440 --> 19:46.320
the wave of, of, of, yes, have whatever you want.

19:46.320 --> 19:47.320
There's water.

19:47.320 --> 19:48.320
There's a home audience.

19:48.320 --> 19:51.800
There's no idea at the array that's out here right now.

19:51.800 --> 19:53.280
The beverage array.

19:53.280 --> 19:55.440
I'm in the Kettle One Alliance now.

19:55.440 --> 20:01.160
I don't know if you're, I don't know if I'm, now it's, and it's you guys against what,

20:01.160 --> 20:04.040
like Captain Bacardi or whatever.

20:04.040 --> 20:11.680
That's Ryan Murphy is, he's Jameson's, you better not take me Jameson's.

20:11.680 --> 20:15.640
I, I, I hear the alliance is in a bitter struggle, right?

20:15.640 --> 20:19.160
Against the, against Ryan Murphy's Bacardi Alliance or Jameson's whatever.

20:19.160 --> 20:20.680
His Bacardi Empire.

20:20.680 --> 20:21.680
Yeah.

20:21.680 --> 20:25.920
There's a, there's a, all of the five major liquors are like the boroughs in,

20:25.920 --> 20:28.960
And POD is working its way into, which is going to throw off the alliance.

20:28.960 --> 20:29.960
Yeah.

20:29.960 --> 20:31.960
Like you can't believe it's going to be like Japan.

20:31.960 --> 20:32.960
Yeah.

20:32.960 --> 20:33.960
And what was that?

20:33.960 --> 20:34.960
Well that's Netflix, right?

20:34.960 --> 20:35.960
The POD War.

20:35.960 --> 20:38.960
I don't know the wars in order.

20:38.960 --> 20:41.000
What was two?

20:41.000 --> 20:44.480
I saw the first one.

20:44.480 --> 20:49.520
Um, but I want to know how, how, when, when you were, when you were, when you were running

20:49.520 --> 20:55.960
a network show, how, what, like, I appreciate you even trying to ask, because you already

20:55.960 --> 20:56.960
know the answer.

20:56.960 --> 21:00.480
You're trying to think of a way that we can get some information out to them, but you

21:00.480 --> 21:01.480
know, it's the exact same experience.

21:01.480 --> 21:06.080
No, I don't, I don't know, I don't know, like, like I want to know how dire it got in terms

21:06.080 --> 21:11.840
of like the, the, uh, distance between what was in your brain and what they were shooting

21:11.840 --> 21:12.840
on set.

21:12.840 --> 21:15.920
I don't know chronologically, like how bad it got, because there's stories about David

21:15.920 --> 21:20.960
Milch literally, they would, this is drama and this is David Milch totally different

21:20.960 --> 21:24.800
thing, but there would be, there's stories about, there's a dude in his parking space

21:24.800 --> 21:25.800
waiting.

21:25.800 --> 21:26.800
Wow.

21:26.800 --> 21:30.880
He pulls up into the parking space and like David Milch rolls out of the car onto his

21:30.880 --> 21:37.520
back and starts saying things into the air and the, and the, and the 20 year old collects

21:37.520 --> 21:44.360
it in a jar and throws it at, at, at the set, uh, and then they shoot that as it explodes

21:44.360 --> 21:45.360
out of the jar.

21:45.360 --> 21:46.360
Like, like, like.

21:46.360 --> 21:47.680
No, it was not, it wasn't like that at all.

21:47.680 --> 21:51.760
It was really, I mean, I, it got, was that Deadwood?

21:51.760 --> 21:52.760
What was that?

21:52.760 --> 21:54.760
It was NYPD Blue.

21:54.760 --> 21:55.760
Okay.

21:55.760 --> 21:56.760
Yeah.

21:56.760 --> 21:57.760
Do you remember that documentary?

21:57.760 --> 21:58.760
You saw him on his back.

21:58.760 --> 21:59.760
Yeah.

21:59.760 --> 22:00.760
There was a shot of him on his back.

22:00.760 --> 22:03.640
No, it was, yeah, a bad back, but he actually would, like he would show, he would, sometimes

22:03.640 --> 22:08.280
he would, you know, they would, he would be laying on his back on set, calling out lines

22:08.280 --> 22:10.240
to the actors and they'd shoot him.

22:10.240 --> 22:11.240
That's what I heard.

22:11.240 --> 22:12.240
They shoot the actors.

22:12.240 --> 22:13.240
Oh, I see.

22:13.240 --> 22:14.240
No, that's not.

22:14.240 --> 22:15.240
Let's try it.

22:15.240 --> 22:20.560
Maybe it's, maybe it's great for creativity, but should we get down there and it wasn't

22:20.560 --> 22:21.560
like that at all.

22:21.560 --> 22:26.760
In fact, I, I see, I always had this illusion of myself as being reasonable.

22:26.760 --> 22:31.480
And then it got, I was accused once of, of, you know, it being rope-a-dope is what it

22:31.480 --> 22:32.480
was called.

22:32.480 --> 22:34.200
Because you said you were a nice guy.

22:34.200 --> 22:39.200
Well, I mean, I would try to, like I made it an effort not to be defensive.

22:39.200 --> 22:42.760
Like that's, which is very hard to do when you're hearing notes, because you just want

22:42.760 --> 22:44.040
everything out of your mouth.

22:44.040 --> 22:46.120
If you've created anything, you want to say, no, you don't get it.

22:46.120 --> 22:47.880
That's not what, I don't want to do it your way.

22:47.880 --> 22:52.200
But if you can, I believe in like trying not to be offensive and trying to let in what

22:52.200 --> 22:54.120
people are saying.

22:54.120 --> 22:57.440
And but then I wouldn't always act on it.

22:57.440 --> 23:00.880
You know, I mean, I would try to take in like, okay, so what they're saying is they, they

23:00.880 --> 23:04.120
don't see that this character cares for his son.

23:04.120 --> 23:05.120
And that's a drag.

23:05.120 --> 23:09.200
I want to up that, but I also don't want to sell it out and, you know, all those things.

23:09.200 --> 23:15.640
But I, I worked so hard on addressing their notes that I, in a funny way, I don't think

23:15.640 --> 23:19.080
they even saw that I was doing it because I would, you know, I could change the sentence

23:19.080 --> 23:22.840
a little bit and I could put this scene earlier, but they didn't want that.

23:22.840 --> 23:23.840
They wanted to see it.

23:23.840 --> 23:24.840
You're not going to believe me.

23:24.840 --> 23:28.320
But the exact, exactly the same way, because I, I came up doing improv.

23:28.320 --> 23:33.640
So I would go, there's no difference between someone in a suit saying, could you put a

23:33.640 --> 23:36.240
dog in it or, or could Annie's care?

23:36.240 --> 23:38.560
I'm not tracking Annie's character in this scene.

23:38.560 --> 23:41.760
There's no difference between that and bringing up someone from the audience and having them

23:41.760 --> 23:43.200
do the sound effects.

23:43.200 --> 23:44.720
It can be invigorating.

23:44.720 --> 23:45.720
Right.

23:45.720 --> 23:48.200
And, and there's a whole creativity that comes out of like, okay, you've got this house.

23:48.200 --> 23:49.200
It's built.

23:49.200 --> 23:50.200
This is the foundation.

23:50.200 --> 23:51.200
But let's see if I move the stairs.

23:51.200 --> 23:54.280
All I have to do is kind of bolster the stairs and still get to the second.

23:54.280 --> 23:56.640
And what they're thinking is, no, we thought you were going to bulldoze it.

23:56.640 --> 23:57.640
Right.

23:57.640 --> 23:58.640
And then they go like, well, I don't understand.

23:58.640 --> 23:59.640
You're not following my notes.

23:59.640 --> 24:01.960
I was like, well, I'm following the note behind your note.

24:01.960 --> 24:06.840
I mean, you were, you were, you were saying that you wanted a flower on the guy's head.

24:06.840 --> 24:10.800
But what you meant was you, you, there, there wasn't a prettiness to the scene.

24:10.800 --> 24:15.400
And so I did that with, by the guy punching the, the, the, the dog.

24:15.400 --> 24:16.400
Right.

24:16.400 --> 24:17.400
Yeah.

24:17.400 --> 24:18.400
Punching the ugly dog.

24:18.400 --> 24:19.400
The, the, because the ugly.

24:19.400 --> 24:20.400
Getting rid of one ugly animal.

24:20.400 --> 24:22.400
He punished the ugly dog by punching it.

24:22.400 --> 24:23.400
Add an ugly animal.

24:23.400 --> 24:24.400
Remove it.

24:24.400 --> 24:25.400
I don't know.

24:25.400 --> 24:26.400
I just.

24:26.400 --> 24:28.400
I don't want to cry.

24:28.400 --> 24:32.240
Like a little, like a relatively large volume of their, of their, of, of notes that are

24:32.240 --> 24:33.240
given to me.

24:33.240 --> 24:36.240
No, I was always very surprised that they did not see that I was doing that.

24:36.240 --> 24:38.000
And then I would get really specific notes.

24:38.000 --> 24:43.160
There was one point where somebody said to me, why are you doing this joke three times?

24:43.160 --> 24:49.240
And I, and I really was like, Oh God, am I doing that?

24:49.240 --> 24:50.240
Oh God.

24:50.240 --> 24:51.240
Like, should it be five times?

24:51.240 --> 24:52.240
Wow.

24:52.240 --> 24:53.240
No.

24:53.240 --> 24:56.600
Why is one a setup and one, why is the thing, and why is one a punchline?

24:56.600 --> 24:58.400
I remember, I remember the joke.

24:58.400 --> 25:03.560
It was when it was Job talking about, it was just this little flight of fancy where someone

25:03.560 --> 25:05.520
said, Job said, did you see the new poof?

25:05.520 --> 25:10.320
Which was a, what the magic magazine was called in a restaurant.

25:10.320 --> 25:13.880
And then Joe kind of misinterprets it, Gary, the new PA, is he, is he gay?

25:13.880 --> 25:17.200
Oh God, I did something that could be taken the wrong way.

25:17.200 --> 25:20.440
And then we see really, I think it was four things that he did that could be taken the

25:20.440 --> 25:24.960
wrong way, the last of them, which is the one that this executive pointed out was him

25:24.960 --> 25:30.760
with Gary on his lap on a chair rocking back and forth saying, well, it's not doing it

25:30.760 --> 25:33.600
now.

25:33.600 --> 25:38.240
And both of them just looking and trying to feel what the chair is doing.

25:38.240 --> 25:41.520
Why are you doing that so many times, why can't you just do it once?

25:41.520 --> 25:46.960
And it really was a, it was a fundamental understanding shift for me when I realized,

25:46.960 --> 25:52.280
do you think I'm being an artist or being something that's going to cost you money?

25:52.280 --> 25:56.760
I'm trying to make this popular, but that was the fundamental misunderstanding.

25:56.760 --> 25:59.080
This is my version of mainstream comedy.

25:59.080 --> 26:03.800
There is no such thing, I hope there isn't, I would think that there would be a person

26:03.800 --> 26:06.760
that you would, who's stuff you had never seen because they wouldn't get off the starting

26:06.760 --> 26:07.760
block.

26:07.760 --> 26:12.800
There's no such thing as a TV comedy writer, listen to those words, TV comedy.

26:12.800 --> 26:13.800
Exactly.

26:13.800 --> 26:18.040
But before you get to the word writer, you have long since made the decision to sell

26:18.040 --> 26:19.040
out.

26:19.040 --> 26:22.000
You want people to like you.

26:22.000 --> 26:25.360
It's like saying magician, masseuse.

26:25.360 --> 26:27.360
Recluse magician.

26:27.360 --> 26:28.840
Recluse of magician.

26:28.840 --> 26:29.840
What?

26:29.840 --> 26:34.040
Like you're not going to be one of those artsy fartsy magician masseuses, are you?

26:34.040 --> 26:35.040
Yeah, we're nothing.

26:35.040 --> 26:38.840
The guy who says, who needs someone to know that the corner disappeared and then rubs

26:38.840 --> 26:39.840
your shoulders?

26:39.840 --> 26:41.400
No, I'd want people to be happy.

26:41.400 --> 26:44.120
But why does it have to be a French franc that disappears?

26:44.120 --> 26:48.320
Why can't it be a half dollar, an American half dollar?

26:48.320 --> 26:51.200
I know you don't want to dumb it down.

26:51.200 --> 26:56.760
They preemptively make you feel like a snob, but no, I am trying as hard as I can.

26:56.760 --> 26:57.760
That's the sad fact.

26:57.760 --> 26:59.320
I'm trying as hard as I can.

26:59.320 --> 27:03.760
Well, you and I both made, I don't even know if it was a decision, but it was based on

27:03.760 --> 27:07.440
our personalities, let's do a show that we would like.

27:07.440 --> 27:08.440
I mean, there aren't people in any field.

27:08.440 --> 27:09.440
I learned it from you.

27:09.440 --> 27:10.440
I don't know what your excuse is.

27:10.440 --> 27:16.280
I swear to God, for watching Arrested Development, it was the moment when the Bluths for the

27:16.280 --> 27:24.760
third time in the show made fun of someone for being cowardly and revealed that the family

27:24.760 --> 27:27.880
as a whole does not know what chickens sound like.

27:27.880 --> 27:33.640
And everyone's going, cool, cuddle, cuddle, cuddle, and Jason Bateman's going, has anyone

27:33.640 --> 27:36.280
in this family heard a chicken?

27:36.280 --> 27:40.800
And I was like, holy shit, and it wasn't, it wasn't like, holy shit, comedy can be so

27:40.800 --> 27:41.800
layered and all this stuff.

27:41.800 --> 27:47.600
What it was was, holy shit, I'm supposed to be making myself laugh.

27:47.600 --> 27:56.000
I'm supposed to be, like there is no, there's no difference between the job of being funny

27:56.000 --> 27:58.400
for other people and being funny for yourself.

27:58.400 --> 27:59.720
It is the same thing.

27:59.720 --> 28:04.080
It is the crazy thing about applause in this crowd that will get you.

28:04.080 --> 28:08.160
I love somebody who can applaud themselves.

28:08.160 --> 28:10.240
I denounced racism yesterday.

28:10.240 --> 28:11.240
Crickets.

28:11.240 --> 28:16.880
These people are, these people hate minorities, they love comedy.

28:16.880 --> 28:17.880
There are a lot of people.

28:17.880 --> 28:18.880
And they were here yesterday.

28:18.880 --> 28:19.880
I don't know.

28:19.880 --> 28:20.880
Sorry.

28:20.880 --> 28:22.880
I love the Saturday practice shows.

28:22.880 --> 28:25.720
This thing is so nailed down.

28:25.720 --> 28:26.720
Am I up?

28:26.720 --> 28:30.680
Did you, was that your line?

28:30.680 --> 28:31.680
Rigorously rehearsed.

28:31.680 --> 28:32.680
Rigorously rehearsed.

28:32.680 --> 28:33.680
Mitch.

28:33.680 --> 28:35.680
Don't add lip.

28:35.680 --> 28:46.240
We opened in two nights, you guys.

28:46.240 --> 28:49.760
I want to see you guys here at 7 a.m. and dressed for movement.

28:49.760 --> 28:53.680
Are the CERC guys coming or is it still us just marking them off with tape?

28:53.680 --> 28:54.680
They'll be here.

28:54.680 --> 28:58.360
Because they're going to throw us when they start doing the gymnastics.

28:58.360 --> 29:02.240
But there is a question a good interviewer would ask you in there, which is, where did

29:02.240 --> 29:03.720
you learn it from?

29:03.720 --> 29:05.920
Because you're a couple years older than me.

29:05.920 --> 29:06.920
No, I listen.

29:06.920 --> 29:08.760
It's very nice that you say that you learned it from me.

29:08.760 --> 29:09.760
But we're all like, I don't remember.

29:09.760 --> 29:10.760
No, I'm not kidding.

29:10.760 --> 29:11.760
I'm telling you.

29:11.760 --> 29:15.200
In terms of specifically, in terms of when sitting down to write a TV comedy script,

29:15.200 --> 29:16.880
I absolutely learned it from you.

29:16.880 --> 29:20.560
I also learned, I picked up, like Tina Fey doing 30 Rock.

29:20.560 --> 29:24.280
Like I definitely was like, holy shit, this is a pace that you can have.

29:24.280 --> 29:27.480
But I would argue, I don't know if she'd disagree, that she learned it, she got that

29:27.480 --> 29:28.480
from you.

29:28.480 --> 29:29.480
I don't know.

29:29.480 --> 29:30.480
I don't know.

29:30.480 --> 29:31.480
I think she'd disagree.

29:31.480 --> 29:35.920
But I think that you changed things with you.

29:35.920 --> 29:36.920
I got it from Ryan.

29:36.920 --> 29:37.920
I don't know if you watched Nip Tuck.

29:37.920 --> 29:41.920
I got a lot of it.

29:41.920 --> 29:48.400
I will say, I think that I remember being a kid, this will date me a little bit, and

29:48.400 --> 29:51.480
watching Get Smart and Thinking is like a little kid.

29:51.480 --> 29:57.800
How come all the shows sound the same that there's one where it doesn't sound the same?

29:57.800 --> 30:01.200
And basically what I was getting at is like, it's a guy's sense of humor.

30:01.200 --> 30:02.200
Right.

30:02.200 --> 30:04.720
Whatever you think of that sense of humor, it was clear that that was like Buck Henry

30:04.720 --> 30:07.400
and Mel Brooks.

30:07.400 --> 30:11.440
And for me, I think I remember seeing, like Larry Sander's show, that was a revelation.

30:11.440 --> 30:16.120
I remember seeing episodes where it would just end and you'd have to do a little thinking

30:16.120 --> 30:17.120
yourself.

30:17.120 --> 30:21.040
You have to say, oh, he's in hell.

30:21.040 --> 30:22.040
He's in hell.

30:22.040 --> 30:26.600
You know, they didn't explain it, he didn't apologize.

30:26.600 --> 30:28.080
That was amazing to me.

30:28.080 --> 30:31.960
And I also came up with a lot of writers that would say things like, well, we could do

30:31.960 --> 30:35.360
the old, that was said in a lot of rooms I was in.

30:35.360 --> 30:39.480
And I remember at that point thinking like, I don't want to ever do the old.

30:39.480 --> 30:40.480
But unfortunately-

30:40.480 --> 30:41.800
I often want to do the old.

30:41.800 --> 30:44.560
I strive, I scramble for it.

30:44.560 --> 30:49.240
I go, oh, oh, oh, this could be like the old thing because I don't know what I'm doing.

30:49.240 --> 30:52.240
But that's because you're inventing it every time.

30:52.240 --> 30:53.280
That's what I try to do.

30:53.280 --> 30:55.280
Try to invent it every time and that's the only way you're going to laugh.

30:55.280 --> 30:58.360
But then it's just a bunch of people with their heads up their asses.

30:58.360 --> 30:59.360
I don't know.

30:59.360 --> 31:03.160
I don't know which version of me is more marketable.

31:03.160 --> 31:07.360
Is it the version that is trying to be like other people or is it the version that is-

31:07.360 --> 31:08.360
No.

31:08.360 --> 31:11.080
I mean, listen, we're all, nobody's that independent.

31:11.080 --> 31:14.480
I mean, I probably could go through an episode of Rest of Development and say, oh, that's

31:14.480 --> 31:15.480
an Albert Brooks thing.

31:15.480 --> 31:16.480
That's a Woody Allen thing.

31:16.480 --> 31:18.080
That's a John Cleese thing.

31:18.080 --> 31:20.720
It all gets filtered through somehow.

31:20.720 --> 31:25.200
But for the most part, if you're trying to make yourself laugh, we happen to have chosen

31:25.200 --> 31:30.840
a field that neither of us are really right for it because television is all about repetition.

31:30.840 --> 31:32.480
That's what it does best.

31:32.480 --> 31:33.800
Maybe up until the current era.

31:33.800 --> 31:34.800
Amen.

31:34.800 --> 31:35.800
Now let's make an edit here.

31:35.800 --> 31:39.480
And for the podcast listeners, there's this brief silence and then some clicking sounds

31:39.480 --> 31:40.480
and then two gunshots.

31:40.480 --> 31:41.480
Right.

31:41.480 --> 31:48.960
Can we just get a, can we get a gas, but it's got to be clean.

31:48.960 --> 31:49.960
No laughter.

31:49.960 --> 31:55.680
And then I'm going, so that would be amazing.

31:55.680 --> 32:03.280
And then, and then about like a three second silence and then slow applause.

32:03.280 --> 32:06.920
But preceded by, I think I know how to help them.

32:06.920 --> 32:10.160
I'll cast a bet of me, Ryan Murphy, witchcraft.

32:10.160 --> 32:11.160
Ryan Murphy.

32:11.160 --> 32:12.160
Ryan Murphy.

32:12.160 --> 32:13.160
Ryan Murphy.

32:13.160 --> 32:16.160
You just need some voodoo magic from the bayou.

32:16.160 --> 32:17.160
From the bayou?

32:17.160 --> 32:20.160
From the bayou?

32:20.160 --> 32:21.160
Irish voodoo?

32:21.160 --> 32:27.120
I think, am I talking about the same guy as he, yeah, yeah, the glee guy is also the

32:27.120 --> 32:28.120
voodoo witch guy, right?

32:28.120 --> 32:29.120
The voodoo witch guy.

32:29.120 --> 32:34.480
He was raised in the bayou and then he went to Ireland and then he decided to comment

32:34.480 --> 32:38.320
on, on superficiality in America.

32:38.320 --> 32:42.800
That's why that's so rich.

32:42.800 --> 32:45.560
Speaking of diversity, let's bring out Kumail Nagyane.

32:45.560 --> 32:56.320
That is the single greatest intro I've ever gotten.

32:56.320 --> 32:58.320
Speaking of diversity.

32:58.320 --> 33:00.720
No, you're supposed to do the speaking of diversity now.

33:00.720 --> 33:01.720
Yeah.

33:01.720 --> 33:02.720
Do you mind speaking about diversity?

33:02.720 --> 33:03.720
I think it's good, guys.

33:03.720 --> 33:04.720
I am on board.

33:04.720 --> 33:09.480
For one thing, it's my, it's my sole recourse to an intro.

33:09.480 --> 33:10.480
Yeah.

33:10.480 --> 33:14.120
Can I say something that happened backstage, is that okay, Mitch?

33:14.120 --> 33:19.600
We were hanging out back, back there and Mitch came in, Mitch Hurwitz, creator of Restor

33:19.600 --> 33:20.600
Development.

33:20.600 --> 33:21.600
And he came up to me.

33:21.600 --> 33:23.600
I got two intros and you got barely one.

33:23.600 --> 33:25.600
I didn't get any intros.

33:25.600 --> 33:30.560
But he came in and he shook my hand and he was like, oh, hey, we met a couple months

33:30.560 --> 33:37.760
ago and I was like, you will never have to remind me of when I met you.

33:37.760 --> 33:38.760
Because you're Indian?

33:38.760 --> 33:39.760
We never forget.

33:39.760 --> 33:44.760
I'm Pakistani, but that's fine.

33:44.760 --> 33:45.760
Yeah.

33:45.760 --> 33:49.760
If you, if you squint at look, Indian, I hate Indians.

33:49.760 --> 33:50.760
Yeah.

33:50.760 --> 33:51.760
Yeah.

33:51.760 --> 33:52.760
Oh my God.

33:52.760 --> 33:53.760
Thanks for coming.

33:53.760 --> 33:54.760
This has been a great picture.

33:54.760 --> 33:55.760
Yeah.

33:55.760 --> 33:56.760
Yeah.

33:56.760 --> 33:57.760
I'm the opposite of Indian.

33:57.760 --> 33:58.760
Yeah.

33:58.760 --> 33:59.760
Assholes.

33:59.760 --> 34:00.760
The opposite of Indian.

34:00.760 --> 34:01.760
Yeah.

34:01.760 --> 34:02.760
That's your drama.

34:02.760 --> 34:03.760
Yeah.

34:03.760 --> 34:08.800
We're the opposite of Indians and the opposite of Jews, I guess.

34:08.800 --> 34:09.800
Not fond of them either.

34:09.800 --> 34:13.240
A lot of you go into cardiology.

34:13.240 --> 34:14.240
My people?

34:14.240 --> 34:15.240
Don't they?

34:15.240 --> 34:16.240
Oh, yeah.

34:16.240 --> 34:17.240
Well, doctor, doctor.

34:17.240 --> 34:18.240
Yeah.

34:18.240 --> 34:19.240
We're mostly doctors.

34:19.240 --> 34:20.240
Yeah.

34:20.240 --> 34:23.040
Is that why would you, is that why I feel comforted by your voice?

34:23.040 --> 34:24.040
Maybe?

34:24.040 --> 34:25.040
I don't know.

34:25.040 --> 34:26.040
I wonder if you'd feel comforted.

34:26.040 --> 34:31.720
I wonder if I've ever had a doctor that was telling me my heart would be okay and

34:31.720 --> 34:32.720
he had.

34:32.720 --> 34:33.720
Yeah.

34:33.720 --> 34:34.720
My dad's a doctor.

34:34.720 --> 34:38.400
I think my mom's waiting for me to play a doctor in a show so she can commit suicide

34:38.400 --> 34:40.680
while she's watching it.

34:40.680 --> 34:41.680
She wouldn't like that.

34:41.680 --> 34:42.680
No.

34:42.680 --> 34:46.120
I think she would be like, oh, if I, now you're mocking your father and, but that's a happy

34:46.120 --> 34:47.120
thing there.

34:47.120 --> 34:48.120
No.

34:48.120 --> 34:49.120
It's a happy thing.

34:49.120 --> 34:50.120
Oh, commit suicide.

34:50.120 --> 34:51.120
Suicide is a good thing.

34:51.120 --> 34:52.120
Oh.

34:52.120 --> 34:53.120
It's the most honorable death possible.

34:53.120 --> 34:54.120
Right.

34:54.120 --> 34:55.120
Right.

34:55.120 --> 34:56.120
Oh boy.

34:56.120 --> 34:57.120
Here he goes again.

34:57.120 --> 34:58.120
Oh boy.

34:58.120 --> 35:00.360
It's an honorable death.

35:00.360 --> 35:05.240
We have to set ourselves on fire to get it to heaven.

35:05.240 --> 35:08.520
Can male, can male save it for your blog?

35:08.520 --> 35:13.920
Did I read correctly that you were voted sexiest man of the year by Salon magazine?

35:13.920 --> 35:14.920
Yeah.

35:14.920 --> 35:16.480
It wasn't a vote.

35:16.480 --> 35:19.520
It was some person decided.

35:19.520 --> 35:21.520
Jason Salon decided.

35:21.520 --> 35:23.520
I don't know.

35:23.520 --> 35:24.520
Yeah.

35:24.520 --> 35:25.520
It was weird.

35:25.520 --> 35:26.520
It's very cool.

35:26.520 --> 35:32.760
It's obviously, and not to say anything about it, Salon, they have a lot of white guilt

35:32.760 --> 35:34.000
in there.

35:34.000 --> 35:38.600
And I think this was their way of like, hey, this should make you guys feel better.

35:38.600 --> 35:43.760
I mean, you're a very attractive man, but I can see the guilt in that.

35:43.760 --> 35:48.080
What I also like is that the description of the article was like, we didn't go off to

35:48.080 --> 35:50.880
guys who hang out in the gym or anything.

35:50.880 --> 35:57.120
Why did you have to put that in there?

35:57.120 --> 36:03.840
We, yeah, we use the term sexy and a little looser around Salon.

36:03.840 --> 36:07.560
One of them is just a really great orange I ate yesterday.

36:07.560 --> 36:13.960
We're not sure the other ones is 10 and you're the only human here.

36:13.960 --> 36:15.680
Check out this park bench.

36:15.680 --> 36:18.120
Ergonomics are the new pecs.

36:18.120 --> 36:19.120
Yeah.

36:19.120 --> 36:20.120
Number three.

36:20.120 --> 36:21.120
There's no future on my episode.

36:21.120 --> 36:22.120
Number three.

36:22.120 --> 36:23.120
Calcium.

36:23.120 --> 36:24.120
Yeah.

36:24.120 --> 36:31.320
Salon.com is number six on their own list of sexiest man.

36:31.320 --> 36:32.320
Come on, that's silly.

36:32.320 --> 36:33.320
You're very sexy.

36:33.320 --> 36:34.320
Thank you guys.

36:34.320 --> 36:35.320
Thank you.

36:35.320 --> 36:36.320
Come on.

36:36.320 --> 36:37.320
Come on.

36:37.320 --> 36:38.320
Come on.

36:38.320 --> 36:39.440
Do something really sexy.

36:39.440 --> 36:40.440
Take your shirt off.

36:40.440 --> 36:42.880
Take your fucking shirt off.

36:42.880 --> 36:43.880
Take your shirt off.

36:43.880 --> 36:44.880
No.

36:44.880 --> 36:45.880
Come on, hot shot.

36:45.880 --> 36:46.880
You're a public figure.

36:46.880 --> 36:47.880
It's not harassment.

36:47.880 --> 36:51.000
I'll be bullied by mature ones.

36:51.000 --> 36:59.560
It's not bullying if you're voted sexy.

36:59.560 --> 37:01.400
You're a public figure now.

37:01.400 --> 37:05.000
Anyway, quick edit, we're going to go back to the music, cheer like you took a shirt

37:05.000 --> 37:06.000
off.

37:06.000 --> 37:07.000
Wait, wait, wait.

37:07.000 --> 37:08.000
We'll let the music go for a second.

37:08.000 --> 37:09.000
Jesus Christ.

37:09.000 --> 37:10.000
Holy cow.

37:10.000 --> 37:11.000
Look at those tips.

37:11.000 --> 37:21.960
If we could do a gunshot and a gasp again.

37:21.960 --> 37:22.960
Right.

37:22.960 --> 37:24.240
Oh my God, his pecs look so good.

37:24.240 --> 37:27.760
Mitch, you thinking what I'm thinking?

37:27.760 --> 37:28.760
Gasp.

37:28.760 --> 37:38.440
Oh my God, gasp take, that's a great, this show is going to take a couple of days to

37:38.440 --> 37:39.440
come out.

37:39.440 --> 37:41.440
This one will not drop tomorrow.

37:41.440 --> 37:46.920
No, you got to go up to like Skywalker Ranch, get the really good quality guys.

37:46.920 --> 37:50.600
We have to go back and add the sound effects of me and Mitch sucking each other's dicks

37:50.600 --> 37:53.400
for the last half hour.

37:53.400 --> 37:56.880
You don't need to add sound effects.

37:56.880 --> 38:00.480
The tape was rolling backstage, you guys.

38:00.480 --> 38:04.360
Axely said, Axely said.

38:04.360 --> 38:09.400
I actually didn't add some of my parents' calls for three days because of that article.

38:09.400 --> 38:10.400
Really?

38:10.400 --> 38:11.400
Yeah.

38:11.400 --> 38:12.400
I really didn't.

38:12.400 --> 38:13.400
I haven't talked to them since then.

38:13.400 --> 38:14.400
Because your phone is ringing off the hook?

38:14.400 --> 38:19.360
No, nobody, they are calling, they want to talk about it, and I don't want to talk to

38:19.360 --> 38:20.360
them about it.

38:20.360 --> 38:24.560
And they're thinking, oh, now he's Mr. Sexy, he doesn't pick up my phone calls anymore.

38:24.560 --> 38:25.560
Do you think that...

38:25.560 --> 38:26.560
Now they'll never go to medical school.

38:26.560 --> 38:30.520
I wish she was Dr. Sexy, yeah.

38:30.520 --> 38:33.920
What do you think your mom's take on that would be?

38:33.920 --> 38:40.040
Well, I'll tell you what was weird is that in the article they wrote that I had a fundamentalist

38:40.040 --> 38:43.800
upbringing, which is a very specific word, and it is not what I had at a conservative

38:43.800 --> 38:45.320
shared Muslim upbringing.

38:45.320 --> 38:48.320
And it took a lot to get them to take that word out.

38:48.320 --> 38:51.800
And my brother texted me like, what the fuck?

38:51.800 --> 38:53.920
Did you have a different upbringing than me?

38:53.920 --> 38:58.880
And I was like, yeah, they made me do like push-ups and pull-ups in the back.

38:58.880 --> 39:04.360
I was doing the monkey bars, they're always doing that when they show like those terrorist

39:04.360 --> 39:05.360
training.

39:05.360 --> 39:06.360
That's how you get sexy.

39:06.360 --> 39:07.360
They're just doing monkey bars.

39:07.360 --> 39:09.960
You must be amazing at the monkey bars now.

39:09.960 --> 39:10.960
Yeah.

39:10.960 --> 39:12.880
I can jump into tires really well.

39:12.880 --> 39:13.880
Yeah.

39:13.880 --> 39:17.880
It's tough to get a bunch of guys together on a Saturday, just go use the monkey bars.

39:17.880 --> 39:20.520
Tough to not get in a league.

39:20.520 --> 39:23.840
My favorite thing in war movies was when a bunch of guys stood in a line with bayonets

39:23.840 --> 39:25.440
and they had to go stab a sack.

39:25.440 --> 39:26.440
Yeah.

39:26.440 --> 39:27.440
Like a thicket sack.

39:27.440 --> 39:28.440
Yeah, now you're ready.

39:28.440 --> 39:29.440
Let's go and make sack land.

39:29.440 --> 39:34.120
You land in Vietnam and you're like, well, there are no playgrounds here, we haven't

39:34.120 --> 39:35.120
prepared.

39:35.120 --> 39:37.560
There are no evenly spaced...

39:37.560 --> 39:40.160
Everyone here has arms and legs and is shooting at me.

39:40.160 --> 39:41.160
Yeah.

39:41.160 --> 39:42.880
Why did we spend months going down that slide?

39:42.880 --> 39:43.880
Yeah.

39:43.880 --> 39:48.440
I could use a seesaw as a death weapon, but we have none here.

39:48.440 --> 39:53.560
Do you ever have to really go under all the barbed wire with a drill sergeant kicking

39:53.560 --> 39:54.560
your butt down?

39:54.560 --> 39:58.640
Have they now figured out to put barbed wire all the way to the bottom?

39:58.640 --> 40:01.200
You know, 60 years later.

40:01.200 --> 40:03.000
Yeah, we've got to do this.

40:03.000 --> 40:04.720
We've got to put it on the ground.

40:04.720 --> 40:05.720
Just lay it down.

40:05.720 --> 40:06.720
Stop putting it up on stands.

40:06.720 --> 40:08.800
It's easier.

40:08.800 --> 40:12.520
And make this wall get these ropes out of here.

40:12.520 --> 40:14.920
Well, that's how they're getting over.

40:14.920 --> 40:17.560
For God's sakes, this is Normandy, not an open house.

40:17.560 --> 40:18.560
Who said they couldn't?

40:18.560 --> 40:20.560
Who said they wouldn't be able to climb the ropes?

40:20.560 --> 40:21.560
Who said that?

40:21.560 --> 40:24.560
That's all we've been practicing for years.

40:24.560 --> 40:26.560
Who said the ropes would scare them?

40:26.560 --> 40:28.560
They're using the ropes.

40:28.560 --> 40:30.560
They're climbing the ropes.

40:30.560 --> 40:31.560
They don't think they're snakes.

40:31.560 --> 40:33.560
They put gnats in them.

40:33.560 --> 40:34.560
They'll never get here.

40:34.560 --> 40:37.560
We have a bridge made of tires protecting us.

40:37.560 --> 40:41.560
No, look at their wide stance while they run.

40:41.560 --> 40:46.560
Yeah, they'll waddle over.

40:46.560 --> 40:50.560
Because it's like, how do you train someone to become a killing machine?

40:50.560 --> 40:53.560
You can't, so you're like, oh, distract them with tires and ropes.

40:53.560 --> 40:55.560
Okay, four square guys, let's go.

40:55.560 --> 40:56.560
Yeah, exactly.

40:56.560 --> 41:00.560
They do always say, if you watch a Word documentary, that's the first thing that they always say.

41:00.560 --> 41:04.560
All the GIs will say, the veterans that they interviewed, they're like, well, we got there,

41:04.560 --> 41:07.560
and we had not prepared for this.

41:07.560 --> 41:08.560
No shit.

41:08.560 --> 41:10.560
Like, definitely not.

41:10.560 --> 41:17.560
No one has ever invaded a military training ground in Minnesota.

41:17.560 --> 41:20.560
There's one wall, but we all wanted to hide behind it.

41:20.560 --> 41:21.560
Nobody wanted to go over it.

41:21.560 --> 41:23.560
All the people could move.

41:23.560 --> 41:26.560
None of them were stationary sack people.

41:26.560 --> 41:29.560
But now the training is very much like the actual war, right?

41:29.560 --> 41:31.560
Because it's like, end this game now.

41:31.560 --> 41:33.560
Oh, I bet it is.

41:33.560 --> 41:34.560
I call it duty.

41:34.560 --> 41:37.560
I'm looking at you guys as people who might read the news now.

41:37.560 --> 41:42.560
I did hear that Amazon is going to use drones to deliver their fucking...

41:42.560 --> 41:43.560
Isn't that crazy?

41:43.560 --> 41:44.560
Not really.

41:44.560 --> 41:45.560
I heard the end of an Amazon story.

41:45.560 --> 41:46.560
Is that what it was?

41:46.560 --> 41:48.560
Yeah, they're going to use drones.

41:48.560 --> 41:49.560
To deliver what?

41:49.560 --> 41:51.560
To deliver, like, just, you know...

41:51.560 --> 41:53.560
A copy of Eat, Pray, Love.

41:53.560 --> 41:54.560
Or, yeah.

41:54.560 --> 41:55.560
30,000 feet.

41:55.560 --> 41:56.560
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

41:56.560 --> 41:58.560
Yeah, Nip Tuck Box said that.

41:58.560 --> 42:01.560
Well, that'd be a Google Chromecast module.

42:01.560 --> 42:03.560
A little parachute comes down and lands on my mailbox.

42:03.560 --> 42:04.560
Like, how does it...

42:04.560 --> 42:06.560
I think they haven't worked out all the details yet.

42:06.560 --> 42:08.560
I don't know how it's going to...

42:08.560 --> 42:10.560
I mean, there's going to be collateral damage.

42:10.560 --> 42:13.560
They are tied to bombs, yeah.

42:13.560 --> 42:15.560
And I don't mean...

42:15.560 --> 42:17.560
But that switch is set to off.

42:17.560 --> 42:19.560
Not that that was a bomb.

42:19.560 --> 42:21.560
That all feels so.

42:21.560 --> 42:27.560
If they're delivering your groceries like that, the bomb switch is off.

42:27.560 --> 42:28.560
Yeah, yeah, I hope so.

42:28.560 --> 42:30.560
I hope they don't get confused.

42:30.560 --> 42:34.560
And then, we're getting bombs and someone in Pakistan has the Nip Tuck Box said.

42:34.560 --> 42:36.560
What the hell?

42:36.560 --> 42:38.560
This is actually a good wedding present.

42:38.560 --> 42:39.560
Thank you.

42:39.560 --> 42:41.560
Yes.

42:41.560 --> 42:46.560
This is Sony Aibo Dog, just talking about our direct TV.

42:46.560 --> 42:48.560
Yeah, we got an Apple TV.

42:48.560 --> 42:51.560
We have nothing to plug it into.

42:51.560 --> 42:55.560
I told you, Dan, I did a couple of USO tours with Drew Carey.

42:55.560 --> 42:58.560
We did, like, improv for troops around, like, before the Iraq invasion,

42:58.560 --> 43:00.560
but after Afghanistan.

43:00.560 --> 43:04.560
And they took us into, like, in the middle of a desert, there's a war room.

43:04.560 --> 43:07.560
There's this big yellow building in the middle of nowhere in the desert.

43:07.560 --> 43:09.560
This big yellow metal building.

43:09.560 --> 43:12.560
And in that building was more bandwidth going into it at that time.

43:12.560 --> 43:15.560
They said in the Kremlin and maybe the Pentagon.

43:15.560 --> 43:18.560
I can't believe it's true, but the whole war was being run from there.

43:18.560 --> 43:20.560
And there was a war games.

43:20.560 --> 43:22.560
Like, you went up to the top floor.

43:22.560 --> 43:27.560
There's these giant tilted, like, tinted windows looking down on a sea of computers

43:27.560 --> 43:29.560
and people in front of these computers.

43:29.560 --> 43:34.560
And on these walls, these giant movie screens of, one, is a satellite map.

43:34.560 --> 43:38.560
One is a, that can change different arenas or areas.

43:38.560 --> 43:40.560
Another, a giant map of the whole region.

43:40.560 --> 43:43.560
And, like, digital blips of everything.

43:43.560 --> 43:45.560
The blue is medical units.

43:45.560 --> 43:47.560
The orange is infantry units.

43:47.560 --> 43:48.560
The red is this.

43:48.560 --> 43:50.560
And then just chuck and buck on one of them.

43:50.560 --> 43:53.560
For some reason, they were just like, chuck and buck.

43:53.560 --> 43:55.560
Not just something that came out of it.

43:55.560 --> 43:56.560
Not far off.

43:56.560 --> 43:57.560
You're actually not far off.

43:57.560 --> 43:59.560
It was CNN on the other one.

43:59.560 --> 44:02.560
For now, not much different.

44:02.560 --> 44:06.560
But we were up there and we walked up there and they turned off a couple computer screens.

44:06.560 --> 44:08.560
They left a couple on.

44:08.560 --> 44:14.560
And one was a picture of a black and white aerial satellite photo.

44:14.560 --> 44:16.560
And I asked like a kernel or something.

44:16.560 --> 44:17.560
I said, what's this?

44:17.560 --> 44:20.560
He goes, oh, this photo was taken five minutes ago.

44:20.560 --> 44:21.560
He goes, we can do it in color.

44:21.560 --> 44:22.560
We can do it, however.

44:22.560 --> 44:25.560
We can also have it like right now, but we don't really need to.

44:25.560 --> 44:27.560
They had Instagram before we did.

44:27.560 --> 44:28.560
Oh, yeah.

44:28.560 --> 44:29.560
Oh, that's what we could do.

44:29.560 --> 44:34.560
We could do this Sierra X-Pro 2.

44:34.560 --> 44:36.560
Nashville, would you have a little thing with this?

44:36.560 --> 44:37.560
Nashville.

44:37.560 --> 44:40.560
It was just a Taliban pictures of stuff they were eating.

44:40.560 --> 44:42.560
There was a picture of a guy.

44:42.560 --> 44:44.560
There was a picture of a guy like BFF.

44:44.560 --> 44:46.560
And then there was a heart.

44:46.560 --> 44:47.560
Wish you were here.

44:47.560 --> 44:49.560
And then there was a picture of someone.

44:49.560 --> 44:50.560
They zoomed in really close.

44:50.560 --> 44:52.560
And it was a picture of an espresso with a heart in it.

44:52.560 --> 44:53.560
Wow.

44:53.560 --> 44:55.560
Yeah, really.

44:55.560 --> 44:58.560
I asked the guy, he zooms in on a guy, and you can see a guy there.

44:58.560 --> 44:59.560
Who is that?

44:59.560 --> 45:00.560
He goes, that's just a farmer.

45:00.560 --> 45:02.560
He's probably like, zoom in on guys?

45:02.560 --> 45:03.560
Yeah.

45:03.560 --> 45:05.560
I go, what's the resolution you have here?

45:05.560 --> 45:06.560
He goes, we load it in.

45:06.560 --> 45:08.560
The resolution is to fuck humanity.

45:08.560 --> 45:09.560
Exactly.

45:09.560 --> 45:10.560
Exactly.

45:10.560 --> 45:11.560
Yeah.

45:11.560 --> 45:12.560
Fuck that guy for farming.

45:12.560 --> 45:13.560
That's the resolution.

45:13.560 --> 45:17.560
Our resolution is to win a thousand times over.

45:17.560 --> 45:19.560
See that guy with the pilot rocks?

45:19.560 --> 45:21.560
We don't just make it New Year's Eve.

45:21.560 --> 45:24.560
I said, could you see if the guy's shoes were tied or untied?

45:24.560 --> 45:27.560
He goes, if you were holding a dime, I could tell you what year it was.

45:27.560 --> 45:30.560
But the good news is he has no money and shoes that don't lace.

45:30.560 --> 45:31.560
Exactly.

45:31.560 --> 45:33.560
Just don't worry about it.

45:33.560 --> 45:34.560
That's what I like about you, Mitch.

45:34.560 --> 45:35.560
We're going to Bright Side.

45:35.560 --> 45:37.560
You're a Bright Side guy.

45:37.560 --> 45:39.560
We have a lot of wasted resolution.

45:39.560 --> 45:41.560
So then they have no money.

45:41.560 --> 45:43.560
That's how they've chosen to evade us.

45:43.560 --> 45:46.560
Like living in games and not having a dime in their hand.

45:46.560 --> 45:51.560
There's a radio shack flight simulator joystick there and he goes, watch this.

45:51.560 --> 45:55.560
He zooms back and then you see some details of a farm and then a thing.

45:55.560 --> 45:57.560
And then you see borders of countries.

45:57.560 --> 45:58.560
Then you see the region.

45:58.560 --> 46:01.560
Then you see the planet Earth and it's upside down because they were doing it for that right.

46:01.560 --> 46:02.560
Then he hits a button.

46:02.560 --> 46:05.560
And then it pulls back and it's Oprah holding it in her hands.

46:05.560 --> 46:08.560
I was going to say just one masculine claw.

46:08.560 --> 46:09.560
Too far, too far.

46:09.560 --> 46:12.560
And then he goes, oh yeah, they turned the monitor off.

46:12.560 --> 46:13.560
Oh shit.

46:13.560 --> 46:15.560
Redacted, redacted.

46:15.560 --> 46:19.560
And I said to him, I said, and you guys can't find Osama bin Laden.

46:19.560 --> 46:24.560
And he kind of gave me like, if we find Osama, this is all over.

46:24.560 --> 46:25.560
Yeah, exactly.

46:25.560 --> 46:30.560
But he gave me a look like, we can, like we find what they ask us to look for, man.

46:30.560 --> 46:32.560
And then we went on a plane.

46:32.560 --> 46:35.560
No one had thought to say, hey, look for Osama.

46:35.560 --> 46:41.560
He said, I go, we have more bandwidth coming into this building than any building ever.

46:41.560 --> 46:45.560
And I said, what does that mean exactly to like explain that to me?

46:45.560 --> 46:48.560
And he goes, if it exists as information, I can get it right now.

46:48.560 --> 46:50.560
I'm gay.

46:50.560 --> 46:55.560
Dan, I'm trying to tell a story.

46:55.560 --> 47:00.560
We'll table your homosexuality for a moment now.

47:00.560 --> 47:02.560
I don't know what that test was.

47:02.560 --> 47:04.560
The story is taking place in the past.

47:04.560 --> 47:07.560
But then we go on this plane with a bunch of people.

47:07.560 --> 47:10.560
There's all these antennae like off the bottom of it and they fly around.

47:10.560 --> 47:11.560
And I forget the name of the plane.

47:11.560 --> 47:15.560
And there's all these people, they're linguists and they listen.

47:15.560 --> 47:18.560
And I walked on the plane and they all turned off their screens.

47:18.560 --> 47:20.560
Like that's like some secret.

47:20.560 --> 47:21.560
Secret shit.

47:21.560 --> 47:24.560
And I was talking to a guy that works in that plane.

47:24.560 --> 47:25.560
I go, so what are you guys listening for?

47:25.560 --> 47:27.560
He goes, they ask us to listen for certain communications.

47:27.560 --> 47:28.560
We find Taliban people.

47:28.560 --> 47:30.560
We find this, we find that, we find targets.

47:30.560 --> 47:32.560
We radio that into the bombers or the fighters.

47:32.560 --> 47:34.560
They go in there and they get those targets.

47:34.560 --> 47:37.560
I go, how do you know that those targets are still there when the bombers get there?

47:37.560 --> 47:38.560
And he goes, that's not our department.

47:38.560 --> 47:39.560
That's crazy.

47:39.560 --> 47:41.560
And so I said, well, what do you, what can you hear?

47:41.560 --> 47:44.560
And he goes, I can't tell you everything that we can hear.

47:44.560 --> 47:45.560
Because that's top secret.

47:45.560 --> 47:49.560
But I will say that this enemy in particular has no idea what we can hear.

47:49.560 --> 47:50.560
And he goes, for instance.

47:50.560 --> 47:58.560
He probably thought, well, I can really tell you because it's not like you're ever going to tell a Pakistani.

47:58.560 --> 48:01.560
Well, with all that change in your pockets and those shoelaces.

48:01.560 --> 48:17.560
That you would tell this whole story to a Shia Muslim.

48:17.560 --> 48:19.560
So he goes, I will say this.

48:19.560 --> 48:20.560
We can listen to you.

48:20.560 --> 48:24.560
If you're at home and your phones are hung up, like your cell phone or your like your landlines are hung up.

48:24.560 --> 48:26.560
We can listen to you through those.

48:26.560 --> 48:27.560
Come on.

48:27.560 --> 48:30.560
And he goes, I said, and that's what you can tell me?

48:30.560 --> 48:35.560
And he goes, he goes, they know that kind of, but we're catching them on their cell phones all the time.

48:35.560 --> 48:37.560
I go, so tell me what you can tell me.

48:37.560 --> 48:40.560
He goes, if it travels over a wave, we can hear it.

48:40.560 --> 48:43.560
And I go, aren't our voices traveling over waves right now?

48:43.560 --> 48:46.560
And he gave me the same smile the other guy did.

48:46.560 --> 48:48.560
The response said, what?

48:48.560 --> 48:51.560
I said, go get this fucking guy.

48:51.560 --> 48:53.560
It's like, not my department.

48:53.560 --> 48:55.560
Like, they tell us where to go.

48:55.560 --> 48:56.560
What to listen to.

48:56.560 --> 48:57.560
What to do.

48:57.560 --> 49:03.560
Is this one of those situations where then the real guy comes in and is like, get to work and that guy is the janitor.

49:03.560 --> 49:05.560
Like, I'm sorry.

49:05.560 --> 49:07.560
Are you doing it again?

49:07.560 --> 49:09.560
He gets your diamond shoelace.

49:09.560 --> 49:11.560
It's true carry.

49:11.560 --> 49:13.560
It's true carry.

49:13.560 --> 49:15.560
By your own mission, this was before Iraq.

49:15.560 --> 49:19.560
May I hazard a guess as to why they couldn't find Osama bin Laden?

49:19.560 --> 49:21.560
This can get really political guys.

49:21.560 --> 49:22.560
I hope you're okay with this.

49:22.560 --> 49:26.560
No one listens this far into the podcast.

49:26.560 --> 49:29.560
He might be in Iraq.

49:29.560 --> 49:31.560
Can't find him.

49:31.560 --> 49:32.560
You think why?

49:32.560 --> 49:33.560
That's why?

49:33.560 --> 49:37.560
I think that I think he was somewhere else and he wasn't high priority.

49:37.560 --> 49:39.560
Osama was it?

49:39.560 --> 49:40.560
I don't know.

49:40.560 --> 49:42.560
I really do believe with the intelligence.

49:42.560 --> 49:45.560
You mean he was in Iraq in the tent next to where Jeff was?

49:45.560 --> 49:47.560
True carry.

49:47.560 --> 49:50.560
No, I will listen.

49:50.560 --> 49:53.560
I actually just watched that Oliver Stone documentary, which is amazing.

49:53.560 --> 49:57.560
If anybody hasn't seen the untold history of the United States, I can't tell you what it is.

49:57.560 --> 49:59.560
It's untold.

49:59.560 --> 50:02.560
It's just a black screen for an hour and a half.

50:02.560 --> 50:05.560
But your imagination goes wild.

50:05.560 --> 50:09.560
Isn't Oliver Stone like the worst historian of all time?

50:09.560 --> 50:12.560
I do believe he put a little too much on Jim Garrison's back in JFK.

50:12.560 --> 50:14.560
He really did.

50:14.560 --> 50:17.560
It's a very valuable work.

50:17.560 --> 50:22.560
But he was very right about platoon because people only spoke in cliches.

50:22.560 --> 50:24.560
That's why we lost.

50:24.560 --> 50:26.560
We were at war with our own language.

50:26.560 --> 50:32.560
We were too busy writing grammar about grunts and calling people cheesedick.

50:32.560 --> 50:34.560
Platoon.

50:34.560 --> 50:37.560
Back then that was an insult.

50:37.560 --> 50:46.560
How is it that if they have that, why are they still like drone bombing weddings and stuff in Afghanistan and Pakistan?

50:46.560 --> 50:49.560
That was supposed to be rice.

50:49.560 --> 50:52.560
This is the worst rice I've ever had.

50:52.560 --> 50:55.560
That was an Amazon drone.

50:55.560 --> 50:57.560
I know what you're talking about.

50:57.560 --> 50:59.560
I put that on my wish list.

50:59.560 --> 51:01.560
I don't know what I'm doing.

51:01.560 --> 51:03.560
I'm like Robin Williams now.

51:03.560 --> 51:05.560
Wish list, Amazon.

51:05.560 --> 51:07.560
Hashtag.

51:07.560 --> 51:09.560
Hashtags and bacon.

51:09.560 --> 51:11.560
That was pretty good.

51:11.560 --> 51:15.560
That was a pretty good Robin Williams.

51:15.560 --> 51:20.560
Mitch Hurwitz is Robin Williams. What should I do tomorrow?

51:20.560 --> 51:25.560
I wonder why Barbara Bush... I don't know.

51:25.560 --> 51:30.560
Take the day.

51:30.560 --> 51:33.560
That's really good.

51:33.560 --> 51:35.560
That's really good.

51:35.560 --> 51:39.560
Before you said a single word, it was like an amazing impression.

51:39.560 --> 51:41.560
It got a little Irish and then I had to abort it.

51:41.560 --> 51:45.560
It's a gold thwait impression of Robin Williams, which is impeccable.

51:45.560 --> 51:47.560
They hang out every day for the last 20 years.

51:47.560 --> 51:49.560
Bobcat.

51:49.560 --> 51:51.560
You can't tell...

51:55.560 --> 51:57.560
Are you friends with Bobcat?

51:57.560 --> 52:01.560
He has done Jeff's job here before when Jeff's been away.

52:01.560 --> 52:05.560
We actually had Bob and Robin on the same show here.

52:05.560 --> 52:09.560
He brought Robin by unexpectedly one night.

52:09.560 --> 52:11.560
He's so funny.

52:11.560 --> 52:13.560
I remember telling me years ago, I haven't seen him in 100 years,

52:13.560 --> 52:15.560
but he had just done...

52:15.560 --> 52:17.560
Are we talking about Bob or Robin?

52:17.560 --> 52:19.560
Yeah, Bob.

52:19.560 --> 52:21.560
Jake's the clown.

52:21.560 --> 52:25.560
Someone said, oh, you guys thought it was Robin Williams.

52:25.560 --> 52:27.560
They both did clown movies.

52:27.560 --> 52:29.560
Yeah, they did.

52:29.560 --> 52:31.560
Very different tones.

52:31.560 --> 52:35.560
Yeah, and Luanda Page, she had a line that was like,

52:35.560 --> 52:40.560
what are you doing here? And she came up with, I got that peanut butter pussy.

52:40.560 --> 52:43.560
It's smooth and brown and easy to spread.

52:43.560 --> 52:47.560
And Bobcat said, okay, we have one that way.

52:53.560 --> 52:55.560
I won Bobcat.

52:55.560 --> 52:57.560
He is amazing.

52:57.560 --> 52:59.560
And another hero of mine in terms of realizing,

52:59.560 --> 53:01.560
that was back in Milwaukee, Bob.

53:01.560 --> 53:03.560
I told him when he came here,

53:03.560 --> 53:05.560
Schrab and I, when we were in Milwaukee,

53:05.560 --> 53:09.560
as just virtual children by today's standards,

53:09.560 --> 53:15.560
watching Bob do stand up and watching him kind of just untethered.

53:15.560 --> 53:17.560
Yeah.

53:17.560 --> 53:19.560
He's on the audience's side,

53:19.560 --> 53:21.560
but he also doesn't even pander to his own audience.

53:21.560 --> 53:23.560
On the audience's side,

53:23.560 --> 53:27.560
but absolutely not accountable to them at all.

53:27.560 --> 53:31.560
On their side, because he expects better of them.

53:31.560 --> 53:33.560
And to the extent that they disappointed him,

53:33.560 --> 53:35.560
he let them know.

53:35.560 --> 53:39.560
And it was really gratifying and liberating to watch

53:39.560 --> 53:43.560
the realization that performance didn't always mean pandering.

53:43.560 --> 53:47.560
You have equal amounts of epiphanies about how it actually is pandering.

53:47.560 --> 53:49.560
What the fuck are you even doing this for,

53:49.560 --> 53:51.560
if you're going to be a jaded piece of shit?

53:51.560 --> 53:53.560
There are lots of epiphanies in that area,

53:53.560 --> 53:57.560
but there are a lot of people who set you free, too, along the way,

53:57.560 --> 53:59.560
and send you the message of, holy shit,

53:59.560 --> 54:01.560
to do this for yourself because no one wants to watch you.

54:01.560 --> 54:03.560
Yeah, I worked with Chris Guest on something,

54:03.560 --> 54:07.560
which, you know, another, like such an important guy in comedy,

54:07.560 --> 54:09.560
and such a, like Bobcat,

54:09.560 --> 54:13.560
and he maintains that he does not care if his audience likes the show,

54:13.560 --> 54:15.560
or likes his movie.

54:15.560 --> 54:17.560
Christopher Guest.

54:17.560 --> 54:21.560
And I would say to him, do you care if your wife likes it?

54:21.560 --> 54:23.560
Yeah, do you care if Michael McKeon likes it?

54:23.560 --> 54:25.560
Right.

54:25.560 --> 54:27.560
Yes, you're getting into an audience.

54:27.560 --> 54:29.560
You're getting into an audience situation, Bruin.

54:29.560 --> 54:31.560
Yeah, because it's a communication.

54:31.560 --> 54:33.560
There's no doubt about it.

54:33.560 --> 54:35.560
You're doing it for other people.

54:35.560 --> 54:37.560
That's the weirdest.

54:37.560 --> 54:39.560
That's the inception top spinning of,

54:39.560 --> 54:41.560
why would I draw on that as a metaphor?

54:41.560 --> 54:43.560
The...

54:43.560 --> 54:49.560
But it spins between the poles of...

54:49.560 --> 54:51.560
They are the most important people in the world,

54:51.560 --> 54:53.560
I'm pointing at the audience,

54:53.560 --> 54:55.560
like there's some kind of horde of plebeians.

54:55.560 --> 54:58.560
You do everything you do for them.

54:58.560 --> 55:01.560
If you enter the vocation that has anything to do with making them happy,

55:01.560 --> 55:03.560
then you owe it to yourself,

55:03.560 --> 55:05.560
and owe it to them to wake up every morning and go,

55:05.560 --> 55:09.560
I would kill myself if they disappeared.

55:09.560 --> 55:13.560
I would be like, I would have no Winslow on my outcast island.

55:13.560 --> 55:15.560
I do everything I do for other people.

55:15.560 --> 55:17.560
I am a psychotic.

55:17.560 --> 55:19.560
I live to entertain.

55:19.560 --> 55:21.560
But because I live to entertain,

55:21.560 --> 55:23.560
I also owe it to them,

55:23.560 --> 55:25.560
whether they like it or not,

55:25.560 --> 55:27.560
to be myself and speak my mind,

55:27.560 --> 55:29.560
because that's what they actually are entertained by,

55:29.560 --> 55:31.560
because believe it or not,

55:31.560 --> 55:33.560
they're human beings that have their own thing going on,

55:33.560 --> 55:35.560
and when they do volunteer,

55:35.560 --> 55:37.560
as we sometimes do,

55:37.560 --> 55:39.560
to sit in a chair and watch somebody else,

55:39.560 --> 55:41.560
they don't want to watch somebody

55:41.560 --> 55:43.560
who spent the day figuring out how to make them laugh.

55:43.560 --> 55:45.560
They want to watch somebody who's making themselves...

55:45.560 --> 55:47.560
I think audiences,

55:47.560 --> 55:49.560
and we're audiences too,

55:49.560 --> 55:51.560
but I think people are highly attuned to being manipulated.

55:51.560 --> 55:53.560
There's a certain amount that they're willing to play along.

55:53.560 --> 55:55.560
I think it's why kind of self-referential stuff

55:55.560 --> 55:57.560
got really popular for a while,

55:57.560 --> 55:59.560
because suddenly we were doing...

55:59.560 --> 56:01.560
Everybody was doing things like product placement

56:01.560 --> 56:03.560
and things like that.

56:03.560 --> 56:05.560
You had to call yourself on it,

56:05.560 --> 56:07.560
but even that's a trick.

56:07.560 --> 56:09.560
You're flipping the pancake.

56:09.560 --> 56:11.560
If you leave it one side down for too long,

56:11.560 --> 56:13.560
it starts to sizzle and burn.

56:15.560 --> 56:17.560
Are we any more subversive than Jack Benny?

56:17.560 --> 56:19.560
No, we're not.

56:19.560 --> 56:21.560
Absolutely not.

56:21.560 --> 56:23.560
In many ways, he was being more subversive than us,

56:23.560 --> 56:25.560
because at least he had the balls

56:25.560 --> 56:27.560
to stop in the middle of his comedy routine

56:27.560 --> 56:29.560
and say, by the way, this is brought to you by a fucking mop.

56:29.560 --> 56:31.560
So we don't actually

56:31.560 --> 56:33.560
gain any distance.

56:33.560 --> 56:35.560
We change, we rotate, we flip,

56:35.560 --> 56:37.560
and we flop, and we flip, and we flop.

56:37.560 --> 56:39.560
What was my point?

56:39.560 --> 56:41.560
Jack Benny in particular was so subversive in a way,

56:41.560 --> 56:43.560
because he really...

56:43.560 --> 56:45.560
He called himself on everything.

56:45.560 --> 56:47.560
That whole show was artifice.

56:47.560 --> 56:49.560
If it was something that would embarrass him,

56:49.560 --> 56:51.560
he'd kind of step away and he'd say,

56:51.560 --> 56:53.560
well, this is just a show.

56:53.560 --> 56:55.560
He deconstructed everything.

56:55.560 --> 56:57.560
It's hilarious.

56:57.560 --> 56:59.560
On satellite radio,

56:59.560 --> 57:01.560
on the classic radio stuff

57:01.560 --> 57:03.560
with Jack Benny's on, it's the greatest listing in the world.

57:03.560 --> 57:05.560
All those guys,

57:05.560 --> 57:07.560
it'll happen to us too.

57:07.560 --> 57:09.560
In three generations, they'll say, oh, that's right, old stuff.

57:09.560 --> 57:11.560
And then hopefully it'll listen to us.

57:11.560 --> 57:13.560
You bit your ass.

57:13.560 --> 57:15.560
You bit your ass, they'll be talking about me in 30 years.

57:15.560 --> 57:17.560
That's what I heard.

57:17.560 --> 57:19.560
That's what I heard Mitch Herbert say.

57:19.560 --> 57:21.560
That was the guy.

57:21.560 --> 57:23.560
They'll be talking about me in 30 years.

57:23.560 --> 57:25.560
I said that wrong.

57:25.560 --> 57:27.560
I'm so sorry, guys.

57:27.560 --> 57:29.560
The guy that actually got hung for hate crimes.

57:29.560 --> 57:31.560
That guy.

57:31.560 --> 57:33.560
You brought the gallows.

57:33.560 --> 57:35.560
Do you know he was a showrunner before all his crimes?

57:35.560 --> 57:37.560
No, I heard it.

57:37.560 --> 57:39.560
What's the show?

57:39.560 --> 57:41.560
I can't remember what it was called.

57:41.560 --> 57:43.560
What's the show?

57:43.560 --> 57:45.560
Nobody up here to leave.

57:45.560 --> 57:47.560
Nobody's leaving, even though it's going to get physically awkward

57:47.560 --> 57:49.560
and crowded.

57:49.560 --> 57:51.560
Because I need to bring, first of all,

57:51.560 --> 57:53.560
Spencer Crittin' into the side stage.

57:53.560 --> 57:55.560
Dungeon Master.

58:01.560 --> 58:03.560
Hey.

58:03.560 --> 58:05.560
What's up?

58:05.560 --> 58:07.560
Mitch, you have to stay and play Dungeons & Dragons with us.

58:07.560 --> 58:09.560
Oh, okay.

58:09.560 --> 58:11.560
That's your punishment.

58:11.560 --> 58:13.560
It's a little game you'll catch on.

58:13.560 --> 58:15.560
Okay.

58:15.560 --> 58:17.560
Super simple game.

58:17.560 --> 58:19.560
You don't have a character for Mitch, do you?

58:19.560 --> 58:21.560
No, and I mean, we're in the final boss fight

58:21.560 --> 58:23.560
right in the middle of it.

58:23.560 --> 58:25.560
That's okay. Don't worry about it. I'll just jump in.

58:25.560 --> 58:27.560
Yeah.

58:27.560 --> 58:29.560
I'll figure it out. Don't worry about it.

58:29.560 --> 58:31.560
I won't make a mockery of it.

58:31.560 --> 58:33.560
No, I mean, I'll totally figure it out.

58:33.560 --> 58:35.560
If you've made a mockery of it,

58:35.560 --> 58:37.560
that'd probably be the best way this could go.

58:37.560 --> 58:39.560
If I made him what?

58:39.560 --> 58:41.560
A mockery of it? No, I won't.

58:41.560 --> 58:43.560
I'll figure it out.

58:43.560 --> 58:45.560
I may say things like, oh, I've got the golden amulet.

58:45.560 --> 58:47.560
I win.

58:47.560 --> 58:49.560
That's what I'm saying. That's what's going to work.

58:49.560 --> 58:51.560
That's what's going to play well here.

58:51.560 --> 58:53.560
I'm not going to say much.

58:53.560 --> 58:55.560
I think regular Harmontown listeners will know how seriously

58:55.560 --> 58:57.560
we take this D&D.

58:57.560 --> 58:59.560
I have an idea. Mitch should play my hawk, Avenger.

58:59.560 --> 59:01.560
Yeah, I was thinking, yeah.

59:01.560 --> 59:03.560
Okay.

59:03.560 --> 59:05.560
By the way, can I say something? My character is a hawk.

59:05.560 --> 59:07.560
Okay.

59:07.560 --> 59:09.560
Someone just tweeted this at me.

59:09.560 --> 59:11.560
You'd be so great at it. Yeah.

59:11.560 --> 59:13.560
They tweeted it at us.

59:13.560 --> 59:15.560
They said, the D&D group has had a liar of

59:15.560 --> 59:17.560
building this whole time.

59:17.560 --> 59:19.560
They said, in episode 50, they found a liar of

59:19.560 --> 59:21.560
building in the treasure after killing the dragon.

59:21.560 --> 59:23.560
And they can basically build

59:23.560 --> 59:25.560
mines, tunnels, ditches.

59:25.560 --> 59:27.560
The effect produced

59:27.560 --> 59:29.560
in 30 minutes of playing

59:29.560 --> 59:31.560
is equal to the work of 100 human humans.

59:31.560 --> 59:33.560
700 human hours.

59:33.560 --> 59:35.560
Yeah, laboring for three days.

59:35.560 --> 59:37.560
Okay, let's do it.

59:37.560 --> 59:39.560
Let's try it.

59:39.560 --> 59:41.560
Give it a shot.

59:41.560 --> 59:43.560
See, he's got it.

59:43.560 --> 59:45.560
He's got it.

59:45.560 --> 59:47.560
Mitch has got it.

59:47.560 --> 59:49.560
What were you worried about, Spence?

59:49.560 --> 59:51.560
That's good.

59:51.560 --> 59:53.560
Can we also bring Erin McGathy?

59:53.560 --> 59:55.560
Erin McGathy.

59:55.560 --> 01:00:05.560
It's my girlfriend, Mitch.

01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:07.560
No, Erin, you want to sit over here.

01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:09.560
I'm going to stand up.

01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:11.560
Okay.

01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:17.560
I'm sorry, guys.

01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:19.560
What a tremendous support crew

01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:21.560
we have. I almost called them a staff,

01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:23.560
but we don't pay them.

01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:25.560
They very briefly

01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:27.560
do something very selfish.

01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:29.560
Mitch, my little brother is your biggest, biggest fan

01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:31.560
in the whole world.

01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:33.560
He is. Could you say hello to Michael McGathey?

01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:35.560
Michael McGathey.

01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:37.560
McGathey.

01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:39.560
Yeah, I've been live

01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:41.560
tweet texting. How old is he?

01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:43.560
He is

01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:45.560
three years younger than I am.

01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:47.560
Oh, well, now you can't say.

01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:49.560
He's 26.

01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:51.560
He's 47.

01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:53.560
Hi, Michael. Thanks for listening to Dan's show.

01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:55.560
You didn't know it was going to be on it,

01:00:55.560 --> 01:00:57.560
but thanks anyway.

01:00:57.560 --> 01:00:59.560
Thank you.

01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:01.560
You seem like a great little guy.

01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:03.560
I feel like, since we have Robin Williams here,

01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:05.560
he should say hello to him.

01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:07.560
Oh, hello, Michael.

01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:09.560
What's the crazy ones?

01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:11.560
Oh, the crazy ones.

01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:15.560
Can you do me a favor, too?

01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:17.560
Can you tell Shabana Nanjiani it's okay,

01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:19.560
I'm not a doctor?

01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:21.560
But do it as

01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:23.560
Sean Connery.

01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:25.560
You do it as Robin Williams again,

01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:27.560
because they know who Robin Williams is.

01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:29.560
I'll do it as Dan Harmon.

01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:31.560
I don't know if you've heard my Dan Harmon impression.

01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:33.560
No, it's pretty good.

01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:35.560
Hey, Shabana.

01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:39.560
It's good that your son's not a doctor.

01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:41.560
Wow.

01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:43.560
Thank you.

01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:45.560
Wow. Thank you.

01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:47.560
That was really close.

01:01:47.560 --> 01:01:49.560
Michael, I also do your sister Erin.

01:01:49.560 --> 01:01:51.560
Let me see if I can...

01:01:57.560 --> 01:01:59.560
That wasn't nice. I'm sorry.

01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:01.560
I'm sorry.

01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:03.560
She doesn't sound like that, Mitch.

01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:05.560
Mitch.

01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:07.560
Alright, so you're a hawk.

01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:09.560
Will Erin describe what she's wearing?

01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:11.560
Because I think it's a propitious day

01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:13.560
to do so, right?

01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:15.560
Oh, thank you, Mitch,

01:02:15.560 --> 01:02:17.560
for logging my animated show.

01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:19.560
Is that what you're doing?

01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:21.560
And paying attention to my girlfriend?

01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:23.560
Oh, does that make the best of the impression?

01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:25.560
I feel like I have to...

01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:27.560
In the celebration of the premiere of Rick and Morty,

01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:29.560
the best animated show I've ever seen,

01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:31.560
several episodes, it's hilarious,

01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:33.560
I painted a sweatshirt featuring

01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:35.560
one of the main characters, Rick.

01:02:35.560 --> 01:02:37.560
Yeah.

01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:39.560
What does it premiere, Dan?

01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:41.560
What does it air? Tell us.

01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:43.560
Rick and Morty airs tomorrow on Adult Swim,

01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:45.560
but it's been on YouTube the whole time.

01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:47.560
But you should say the day of the week,

01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:49.560
because it's a podcast.

01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:51.560
Well, probably tonight, if you're listening to this.

01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:53.560
But the podcast will come out in a couple days,

01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:55.560
or does it come out right away?

01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:57.560
We're not going to really make those edits,

01:02:57.560 --> 01:02:59.560
so tomorrow.

01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:01.560
It'll be tomorrow.

01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:03.560
So tonight, Rick and Morty's on.

01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:05.560
But it's also been on YouTube for two weeks.

01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:07.560
It's a new business model, I'm just trying to help.

01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:09.560
It's December 1st, 2013.

01:03:09.560 --> 01:03:11.560
December 1st, 2013.

01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:13.560
They did it on YouTube like two weeks ago.

01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:15.560
Not two weeks, like a week ago.

01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:17.560
Really? Yeah.

01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:19.560
Well, I saw one hilarious little promo,

01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:21.560
but I didn't see the episode.

01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:23.560
But it's been on YouTube.

01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:25.560
We don't get YouTube.

01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:27.560
We don't get it.

01:03:27.560 --> 01:03:29.560
I have no idea what they're thinking.

01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:31.560
They're probably thinking wonderful things.

01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:33.560
They're certainly the best network.

01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:35.560
YouTube?

01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:37.560
Yeah.

01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:39.560
I don't know.

01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:41.560
It's a new...

01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:43.560
I remember they put the

01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:45.560
pilot for community on Facebook

01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:47.560
a couple days before it aired on NBC.

01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:49.560
And I remember being young and naive

01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:51.560
enough to go,

01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:53.560
what? But that means...

01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:55.560
And I remember someone from NBC

01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:57.560
basically saying, in your wildest dreams

01:03:57.560 --> 01:03:59.560
so many people would want to watch your shit

01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:01.560
that this would be a problem.

01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:03.560
Right.

01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:05.560
And that's the new attitude with marketing.

01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:07.560
TV, it's a long con.

01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:09.560
You want to get 100 episodes

01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:11.560
so it's valuable for them.

01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:13.560
The people that really pay for this thing.

01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:15.560
But at the same time as they dump your shit online

01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:17.560
and then nobody watches.

01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:19.560
But I don't think that's the reason nobody will watch.

01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:21.560
I don't know.

01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:23.560
Numbers mean nothing.

01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:25.560
Those numbers mean that someone's cat fell asleep

01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:27.560
on someone's arm.

01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:29.560
Those numbers mean nothing.

01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:31.560
They can't mean anything when they're that low.

01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:33.560
But even if you just had...

01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:35.560
10 million viewers.

01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:37.560
Like everything on basic cable.

01:04:37.560 --> 01:04:39.560
Yeah.

01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:41.560
Things get... I mean, apparently,

01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:43.560
even shows like Girls get in the hundreds of thousands.

01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:45.560
Yeah, Girls gets...

01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:47.560
It was like 600,000 or something.

01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:49.560
But it's a fantastic show.

01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:51.560
And I think it's the right 600,000

01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:53.560
or whatever the number is.

01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:55.560
Dan or Mitch, how would you feel about ratings

01:04:55.560 --> 01:04:57.560
if you guys were the number one rated show?

01:04:57.560 --> 01:04:59.560
I don't think you messed with the system.

01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:01.560
I think it worked.

01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:03.560
I mean, are we too quick to...

01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:05.560
Did anyone say that ratings...

01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:07.560
We're not sitting up here saying that ratings

01:05:07.560 --> 01:05:09.560
are unimportant.

01:05:09.560 --> 01:05:11.560
We're saying the opposite. We're kind of lamenting.

01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:13.560
We want a number that says that

01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:15.560
a billion people are watching our show.

01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:17.560
We're not going like...

01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:19.560
After a recipe, you know, they gave it to MSN,

01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:21.560
which was, you know, then like a big portal like AOL.

01:05:21.560 --> 01:05:23.560
It was just all the restaurants were on there for free.

01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:25.560
They just gave it all away.

01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:27.560
Anyway, maybe if everyone here...

01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:29.560
I just want to entertain.

01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:31.560
I know, but it's not that big of a crap.

01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:33.560
If everybody chips in like 10 grand...

01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:41.560
Can I tell a story real quick that has nothing to do with this,

01:05:41.560 --> 01:05:43.560
but it's sort of time-appropriate?

01:05:43.560 --> 01:05:45.560
Sure, as long as it's about time.

01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:49.560
Because that's a good segue.

01:05:49.560 --> 01:05:51.560
Wow, that was...

01:05:51.560 --> 01:05:53.560
Time is passing and you're going to tell a time-related story.

01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:55.560
By the way, I thought that thing about the reclusive magician

01:05:55.560 --> 01:05:57.560
was really great.

01:05:57.560 --> 01:05:59.560
Oh, come on.

01:05:59.560 --> 01:06:01.560
I was like, oh my god, that's fucking amazing.

01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:03.560
It's just a sad magician in a room

01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:05.560
like, ta-da!

01:06:05.560 --> 01:06:07.560
No, see, the way I heard that

01:06:07.560 --> 01:06:09.560
was the best magician in the world

01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:11.560
who doesn't need the feedback.

01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:13.560
Yeah, like Salinger, the Salinger magician.

01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:15.560
The trick is the points.

01:06:15.560 --> 01:06:17.560
And he just can't fool himself. He just can't do it.

01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:19.560
I feel like Merlin and Gandalf are probably pretty reclusive,

01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:21.560
but those are people...

01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:23.560
Those are wizards.

01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:25.560
But they're also in all those movies.

01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:27.560
Yeah. I think Merlin's pretty social.

01:06:27.560 --> 01:06:29.560
What were you going to say?

01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:31.560
What were you going to say, Camille?

01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:33.560
You know, the other day, I had a shoe!

01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:35.560
I'm sorry, that wasn't fair of me to do that impression.

01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:37.560
I...

01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:39.560
I was busting Dan

01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:41.560
with my impression of Dan

01:06:41.560 --> 01:06:43.560
jumping in.

01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:49.560
I thought of it this week.

01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:51.560
The first time I was in America,

01:06:51.560 --> 01:06:53.560
I was like really little.

01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:55.560
And I landed in Queens

01:06:55.560 --> 01:06:57.560
where my uncle was.

01:06:57.560 --> 01:06:59.560
And it was 6 a.m.

01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:01.560
and we couldn't sleep.

01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:03.560
It just happened to be a Thursday morning.

01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:05.560
And my uncle was like, here, I want to show you something.

01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:07.560
My first day in America,

01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:09.560
and we went down,

01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:11.560
and he showed me the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.

01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:13.560
And I had no idea what Thanksgiving was.

01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:15.560
And I thought that's what happened every day.

01:07:15.560 --> 01:07:17.560
I was like, we get up

01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:19.560
and we're fucking like, look at us go!

01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:21.560
How old were you?

01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:23.560
I don't remember.

01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:25.560
I was probably not even like, maybe 9 or something.

01:07:25.560 --> 01:07:27.560
To young Pakistani eyes,

01:07:27.560 --> 01:07:29.560
did it look like they were like dragging animals

01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:31.560
and effigy down the street?

01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:33.560
Just got curious.

01:07:33.560 --> 01:07:35.560
Did it look like, oh, they hate Kermit.

01:07:35.560 --> 01:07:37.560
They hate Garfield.

01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:41.560
I don't think they filtered everything

01:07:41.560 --> 01:07:43.560
through stock footage of terrorists.

01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:45.560
I don't know.

01:07:45.560 --> 01:07:47.560
He's waiting for Mussolini.

01:07:47.560 --> 01:07:49.560
That's the spirit of the question, dude.

01:07:49.560 --> 01:07:51.560
You know, this Infidel Charlie Brown.

01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:53.560
You know,

01:07:53.560 --> 01:07:55.560
I'd never used the word Infidel until I came to America.

01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:57.560
Yeah.

01:07:57.560 --> 01:07:59.560
Because we were just us.

01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:07.560
I think I've told the story,

01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:09.560
but at that exact age,

01:08:09.560 --> 01:08:11.560
even though I was born and raised

01:08:11.560 --> 01:08:13.560
where the miracles happen,

01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:15.560
that didn't stop me from watching

01:08:15.560 --> 01:08:17.560
David Copperfield make the Statue of Liberty disappear.

01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:19.560
Oh, yeah.

01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:21.560
Did I tell the story on this podcast

01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:23.560
where I thought

01:08:23.560 --> 01:08:25.560
I watched him make it disappear

01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:27.560
and they used to make such a to-do

01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:29.560
about things in broadcast TV make them

01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:31.560
that I turned off the TV and was like,

01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:33.560
huh, it's gone.

01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:35.560
Hundreds of years of history.

01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:37.560
How about that?

01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:39.560
And I remember my aunt coming up

01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:41.560
and going like, what's wrong?

01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:43.560
And me going like, it's just

01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:45.560
David Copperfield made the Statue of Liberty disappear

01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:47.560
and I was like, oh, interesting.

01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:49.560
And I was like, no, it's just, I mean, interesting?

01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:51.560
It's fucked up.

01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:53.560
The French gave it to us and I was like...

01:08:53.560 --> 01:08:55.560
It's like 9-11 to your little aunt.

01:08:55.560 --> 01:08:57.560
It was.

01:08:57.560 --> 01:08:59.560
It was like a peaceful 9-11.

01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:01.560
I expected that he really made it disappear

01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:03.560
for real from the earth

01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:05.560
and was pontificating about whether or not

01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:07.560
that was right or wrong politically.

01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:09.560
I like the idea of Osama

01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:11.560
seeing that also believing it

01:09:11.560 --> 01:09:13.560
and then trying to recruit him

01:09:13.560 --> 01:09:15.560
and then going down.

01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:17.560
My aunt was like, turn on the TV.

01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:19.560
I think he probably brought it back.

01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:21.560
No, I don't think so.

01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:23.560
Dan, how did young you feel when the Harlem Globetrotters

01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:25.560
made it to Gilligan's Island?

01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:27.560
Did they really make it there?

01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:29.560
Well, yeah, they made it there.

01:09:29.560 --> 01:09:31.560
Mellark is buried there.

01:09:31.560 --> 01:09:33.560
Deleted scene.

01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:39.560
Sherwood Schwarz was the best.

01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:41.560
Like Belushi, you know, on Martha's Vineyard.

01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:43.560
You go out to Burbank in Studio City

01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:45.560
and, you know, just try to find...

01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:47.560
Jim Belushi died!

01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:55.560
That was part one of a three-part joke

01:09:55.560 --> 01:09:57.560
but no one did the other two.

01:09:57.560 --> 01:09:59.560
I think everyone did it in their head.

01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:01.560
I've been in Jim Belushi's basement.

01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:03.560
Let's play D&D.

01:10:03.560 --> 01:10:05.560
Listen.

01:10:05.560 --> 01:10:07.560
The big story is that you're here to tell it.

01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:09.560
I mean, there are very few people

01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:11.560
to go out of there.

01:10:11.560 --> 01:10:13.560
Yeah, how did you get out?

01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:15.560
Yeah.

01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:17.560
She's talking about the hipster breakfast place

01:10:17.560 --> 01:10:19.560
in Connecticut.

01:10:19.560 --> 01:10:21.560
Jim Belushi's basement.

01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:23.560
That host slapped you on the ass on the way in.

01:10:23.560 --> 01:10:25.560
Yeah.

01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:27.560
That's what they call the colon word at the...

01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:29.560
Jim Belushi's basement.

01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:31.560
Yeah, because he gave a lot of money

01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:33.560
to the colon co- erectile.

01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:35.560
Mitch, you're a TV guy.

01:10:35.560 --> 01:10:37.560
You've been around for a while.

01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:39.560
I've heard a story that...

01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:41.560
Wait, no, we're interrupting a story about Jim Belushi.

01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:43.560
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:45.560
I had a boyfriend

01:10:45.560 --> 01:10:47.560
who was friends with Jim Belushi's son.

01:10:47.560 --> 01:10:49.560
Oh, is this in Chicago?

01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:51.560
His son used to...

01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:53.560
It's the same son, I'm guessing.

01:10:53.560 --> 01:10:55.560
Rob Belushi, I can say that.

01:10:55.560 --> 01:10:57.560
That was very nice of you

01:10:57.560 --> 01:10:59.560
to point out that...

01:10:59.560 --> 01:11:01.560
she was interrupted.

01:11:01.560 --> 01:11:03.560
Jeff, in which case...

01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:05.560
You're a really fantastic guy.

01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:07.560
Thank you.

01:11:07.560 --> 01:11:09.560
I like that you're interrupting her story

01:11:09.560 --> 01:11:11.560
to thank someone for stopping

01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:13.560
someone else from interrupting her story.

01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:15.560
Camille, I like how diverse you are.

01:11:15.560 --> 01:11:17.560
Thank you.

01:11:17.560 --> 01:11:19.560
Hey, we're just putting the onus on the bonus, right?

01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:21.560
And hey, Spencer.

01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:23.560
Hey, guys.

01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:25.560
Hi, Spencer, how are you?

01:11:25.560 --> 01:11:27.560
Rob Belushi.

01:11:27.560 --> 01:11:29.560
Very brief story.

01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:31.560
I used to date somebody

01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:33.560
that was friends with Rob Belushi

01:11:33.560 --> 01:11:35.560
and took me on an outing.

01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:37.560
I didn't know where we were going,

01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:39.560
and the big reveal was that we were going to Jim Belushi's base.

01:11:39.560 --> 01:11:41.560
Did he close your eyes and was like,

01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:43.560
Ah!

01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:45.560
Why are there Jim Belushi posters everywhere?

01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:47.560
More or less.

01:11:47.560 --> 01:11:49.560
I will say, and I don't think that this is going...

01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:51.560
Slightly newer blues brothers.

01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:53.560
Why is it the highest

01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:55.560
concentration of Jim Belushi versions

01:11:55.560 --> 01:11:57.560
I've ever seen in?

01:11:57.560 --> 01:11:59.560
Why are there according to Jim Box sets everywhere?

01:11:59.560 --> 01:12:01.560
You guys are doing bits,

01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:03.560
but I don't think

01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:05.560
that Jim Belushi would mind me.

01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:07.560
Well, I don't care what he would mind,

01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:09.560
but his basement

01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:11.560
is a bar,

01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:13.560
but it's covered with pictures

01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:15.560
similar to an Irish bar, but it's just Jim Belushi

01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:17.560
shaking hands with different people.

01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:19.560
And so the reveal was, he was like,

01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:21.560
Do you know where you are? And I was like,

01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:23.560
Well, someone loves Jim Belushi.

01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:25.560
Oh, the Jim Belushi's house!

01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:27.560
So that was the big thing.

01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:29.560
All the people who are shaking hands with are people

01:12:29.560 --> 01:12:31.560
who don't know.

01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:33.560
Good job on the crown molding.

01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:35.560
The guy that gave me the Miller Life picture.

01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:37.560
Thank you for moving this dartboard into here.

01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:39.560
They just want to leave.

01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:41.560
They just want to leave.

01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:43.560
Oh, in a wall with a hundred telephoto.

01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:45.560
This is the guy who sold me the DLP TV.

01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:47.560
Man, this guy's really taken a pounding

01:12:47.560 --> 01:12:49.560
in this conversation.

01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:51.560
I heard a story that

01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:53.560
he pissed off his

01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:55.560
co-stars on Life According to Jim.

01:12:55.560 --> 01:12:57.560
Is that what it's called? According to Jim.

01:12:57.560 --> 01:12:59.560
And, uh...

01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:01.560
Everything, everything according to Jim.

01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:03.560
It's according to Jim.

01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:05.560
Don't get all Indian on me.

01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:11.560
He didn't want to go off the set to go pee

01:13:11.560 --> 01:13:13.560
in the bathroom, which was just off the soundstage.

01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:15.560
He took the pickle jar on the craft service table

01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:17.560
and took a piss in the pickle jar

01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:19.560
next to his, like, female co-star.

01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:21.560
That's a story I've heard.

01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:23.560
But he must have been like,

01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:25.560
Now am I a legend?

01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:27.560
What is it gonna take?

01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:29.560
Nobody would know the name of his book.

01:13:29.560 --> 01:13:31.560
It's called...

01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:33.560
It's called Pissing in the Pickles.

01:13:33.560 --> 01:13:35.560
He has a book called

01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:37.560
Not Ah, My Lady, or something like...

01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:39.560
It's got the cover of the book.

01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:41.560
That's what I said.

01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:43.560
It's a bicep tattoo with the title of the book on it,

01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:45.560
which is like, Real Men Don't Say I'm Sorry or Something.

01:13:45.560 --> 01:13:47.560
Yes, that's exactly the title.

01:13:47.560 --> 01:13:49.560
I don't own it.

01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:51.560
Let it be known, I said nothing

01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:53.560
against Jim Belushi this entire time.

01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:55.560
Don't...is that an apology?

01:13:55.560 --> 01:13:57.560
Because I know that Jim Belushi would look down on that.

01:13:57.560 --> 01:13:59.560
That's not his thing.

01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:01.560
What?

01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:03.560
You don't...Real Men Don't Say I'm Sorry.

01:14:03.560 --> 01:14:05.560
Oh.

01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:07.560
I was like, Mitch, that was amazing!

01:14:07.560 --> 01:14:09.560
Mitch Hurwitz.

01:14:09.560 --> 01:14:11.560
That's all I want.

01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:13.560
Real Men will put their shirt back on.

01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:15.560
He's a very...I've met him a couple times.

01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:17.560
He's a very, very nice guy.

01:14:17.560 --> 01:14:19.560
Yeah, just so Shabani...

01:14:19.560 --> 01:14:21.560
Shabani knows.

01:14:21.560 --> 01:14:23.560
That was me...

01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:25.560
Jim Belushi just shot himself.

01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:31.560
Jim Belushi just dropped from the rafters

01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:33.560
with a half-mask on.

01:14:33.560 --> 01:14:35.560
Hey, hey, hey!

01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:37.560
That must have been why we were talking about him.

01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:39.560
We saw him and we forgot.

01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:41.560
He has haunted this comic book store.

01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:43.560
I know.

01:14:43.560 --> 01:14:45.560
That was actually Amazon Drones delivering

01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:47.560
a demand with one red shoe.

01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:49.560
The nerd...

01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:51.560
Meltdown used to be a

01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:53.560
cigar humidor.

01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:55.560
And he's haunted it ever since it got turned

01:14:55.560 --> 01:14:57.560
into a comic book store.

01:14:57.560 --> 01:14:59.560
What are all these picture books?

01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:01.560
Spot on, Jim Belushi.

01:15:01.560 --> 01:15:03.560
Why are none of these pictures of me?

01:15:05.560 --> 01:15:07.560
I do like...

01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:09.560
Mitch, have you got a Jim Belushi impression for us?

01:15:09.560 --> 01:15:11.560
I've got a John Belushi impression

01:15:11.560 --> 01:15:13.560
and it's not very good, so yes.

01:15:13.560 --> 01:15:15.560
Oh, my God!

01:15:15.560 --> 01:15:17.560
Oh, my God!

01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:19.560
Jim Belushi is too easy.

01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:23.560
Too easy.

01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:25.560
And I don't...

01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:27.560
That's funny.

01:15:27.560 --> 01:15:29.560
I have no beef with a man.

01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:31.560
Jim Belushi, get off the roof!

01:15:31.560 --> 01:15:33.560
He's trying to get in.

01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:35.560
Oh, my God.

01:15:35.560 --> 01:15:37.560
He's somewhere Jim Belushi just looked around.

01:15:37.560 --> 01:15:39.560
He felt that.

01:15:39.560 --> 01:15:41.560
Mitch, did you write that a week ago

01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:43.560
and hope we would get here?

01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:45.560
I regret it immediately.

01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:47.560
Jim Belushi is in our electronic system.

01:15:47.560 --> 01:15:49.560
I know.

01:15:49.560 --> 01:15:51.560
And in our hearts.

01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:55.560
That was amazing.

01:15:55.560 --> 01:15:57.560
Let's play some music.

01:15:57.560 --> 01:15:59.560
We're at a crucial point in our D&D campaign, Mitch.

01:15:59.560 --> 01:16:01.560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:16:01.560 --> 01:16:03.560
I won't get... I'll let you do it.

01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:05.560
As a first timer, I want you to treat yourself.

01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:07.560
Spencer here is our Dungeon Master extraordinaire.

01:16:07.560 --> 01:16:09.560
Hello.

01:16:09.560 --> 01:16:11.560
And he will catch us up to date

01:16:11.560 --> 01:16:13.560
where we are in the campaign.

01:16:13.560 --> 01:16:15.560
Yeah.

01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:19.560
What's up, you guys?

01:16:23.560 --> 01:16:25.560
That's good to hear.

01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:27.560
When we last met,

01:16:27.560 --> 01:16:29.560
our heroes were being assaulted

01:16:29.560 --> 01:16:31.560
by a mysterious metal mitt.

01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:33.560
After pulling the head off

01:16:33.560 --> 01:16:35.560
their mortal enemy,

01:16:35.560 --> 01:16:37.560
a massive arm burst through the floor,

01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:39.560
grabbing Quark and holding him fast.

01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:41.560
As Mulraine worked to free the halfling,

01:16:41.560 --> 01:16:43.560
Sharpie quickly turned into gas.

01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:45.560
The wizards seeped through the crack in the floor

01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:47.560
and saw the massive metallic golem,

01:16:47.560 --> 01:16:49.560
golem,

01:16:49.560 --> 01:16:51.560
to which the arm belonged

01:16:51.560 --> 01:16:53.560
and flowed through his middle plates

01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:55.560
and into his inner workings.

01:16:55.560 --> 01:16:57.560
Then as Quark and Mulraine attacked the golem,

01:16:57.560 --> 01:16:59.560
Quark began...

01:16:59.560 --> 01:17:01.560
I'm sorry.

01:17:01.560 --> 01:17:03.560
Sharpie began punching a red glowing node

01:17:03.560 --> 01:17:05.560
that began emitting a glowing red heat,

01:17:05.560 --> 01:17:07.560
and then I got pissed and left.

01:17:07.560 --> 01:17:09.560
Is that what happened?

01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:13.560
Spencer, point of order.

01:17:13.560 --> 01:17:15.560
I'm not a halfling, I'm a gnome.

01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:17.560
Oh, shit!

01:17:17.560 --> 01:17:19.560
Jeff, leave!

01:17:19.560 --> 01:17:21.560
If I had something to turn in like a badge,

01:17:21.560 --> 01:17:23.560
I'd put it on the table.

01:17:23.560 --> 01:17:25.560
Wait, Spencer,

01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:27.560
you got pissed off last time and left?

01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:29.560
Yeah, yeah. I mean, something like that.

01:17:29.560 --> 01:17:31.560
It was a bit.

01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:33.560
He's not allowed to say it was a bit.

01:17:33.560 --> 01:17:35.560
Just how fun would that be?

01:17:35.560 --> 01:17:37.560
I mean, I thought about doing it in the past,

01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:39.560
but it worked best there in that circumstance.

01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:41.560
But we sat here

01:17:41.560 --> 01:17:43.560
like thunderstruck.

01:17:43.560 --> 01:17:45.560
Yeah, well, I couldn't be accountable for that at that point.

01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:47.560
Yeah.

01:17:47.560 --> 01:17:49.560
I could have saved the show, but I was offstage.

01:17:49.560 --> 01:17:51.560
All right,

01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:53.560
Spencer, draw for us the picture,

01:17:53.560 --> 01:17:55.560
remind everybody, and Mitch especially,

01:17:55.560 --> 01:17:57.560
what we're looking at in the room

01:17:57.560 --> 01:17:59.560
that we're in right now. Okay, so imagine

01:17:59.560 --> 01:18:01.560
you're on the second floor.

01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:03.560
You're way higher than that. You're up in a tower,

01:18:03.560 --> 01:18:05.560
and it's coming in, and it's grabbed.

01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:07.560
It's grabbing around. It's just an arm.

01:18:07.560 --> 01:18:09.560
And on the lower level,

01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:11.560
you got a big robot man,

01:18:11.560 --> 01:18:13.560
and he's putting the arm up there.

01:18:13.560 --> 01:18:15.560
And now you are inside

01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:17.560
this robot. Right.

01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:19.560
And you guys, no, Clark's on the top level,

01:18:19.560 --> 01:18:21.560
Kumail's on it,

01:18:21.560 --> 01:18:23.560
Christopher's on the top level,

01:18:23.560 --> 01:18:25.560
and Mulraine's on the robot's shoulder.

01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:27.560
And Mitch,

01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:29.560
Kumail's character is

01:18:29.560 --> 01:18:31.560
Christopher, the guy that wrote Lady and Red.

01:18:31.560 --> 01:18:33.560
He just told me that.

01:18:33.560 --> 01:18:35.560
He was like, who's Christopher? Yeah.

01:18:35.560 --> 01:18:37.560
Oh, well, so you've heard my work.

01:18:37.560 --> 01:18:39.560
No, I haven't.

01:18:39.560 --> 01:18:41.560
It's a great song. Do you have ladies in any other colors?

01:18:41.560 --> 01:18:43.560
I guess it's more important than

01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:45.560
in previous episodes,

01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:47.560
but if I'm gas,

01:18:47.560 --> 01:18:49.560
and I went gaseously into the robot,

01:18:49.560 --> 01:18:51.560
and I'm like punching,

01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:53.560
where's my hawk? Yeah, that's a great question.

01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:55.560
A venture.

01:18:55.560 --> 01:18:57.560
Can the honk not vaporize?

01:18:57.560 --> 01:18:59.560
I mean, it can.

01:18:59.560 --> 01:19:01.560
It's created by spells that affect the user.

01:19:01.560 --> 01:19:03.560
Oh, really? So the hawk came with me?

01:19:03.560 --> 01:19:05.560
In theory.

01:19:05.560 --> 01:19:07.560
All right. I look around for a venture.

01:19:07.560 --> 01:19:09.560
A venture!

01:19:09.560 --> 01:19:11.560
That's you.

01:19:11.560 --> 01:19:13.560
Played by Robin Williams.

01:19:13.560 --> 01:19:15.560
This far in the podcast.

01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:19.560
Yeah, right here, boss.

01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:21.560
Oh, good. Thank you.

01:19:21.560 --> 01:19:23.560
I was worried about you.

01:19:23.560 --> 01:19:25.560
It just got a little gassy, and I just...

01:19:25.560 --> 01:19:27.560
But I'm here, I'm back.

01:19:27.560 --> 01:19:29.560
All right.

01:19:29.560 --> 01:19:31.560
I keep punching the...

01:19:31.560 --> 01:19:33.560
I'm assuming this is the robot's heart,

01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:35.560
and I'm going to hit it

01:19:35.560 --> 01:19:37.560
and stab it and kick it and spit on it.

01:19:37.560 --> 01:19:39.560
As you do all those things

01:19:39.560 --> 01:19:41.560
to the glowing red spot, it begins

01:19:41.560 --> 01:19:43.560
to grow, grow, glow

01:19:43.560 --> 01:19:45.560
brighter and hotter and brighter and hotter,

01:19:45.560 --> 01:19:47.560
as it burns you with a glowing

01:19:47.560 --> 01:19:49.560
hot energy.

01:19:49.560 --> 01:19:51.560
Don't stop doing that.

01:19:51.560 --> 01:19:53.560
You really? Yeah. Don't do it.

01:19:53.560 --> 01:19:55.560
All right. Because it's getting hotter.

01:19:55.560 --> 01:19:57.560
It is.

01:19:57.560 --> 01:19:59.560
You take three heat damage.

01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:01.560
I take three heat damage. Yeah, that's how hot it is.

01:20:01.560 --> 01:20:03.560
All right. I wish there was a way

01:20:03.560 --> 01:20:05.560
to...

01:20:05.560 --> 01:20:07.560
to leave like a grenade here

01:20:07.560 --> 01:20:09.560
and just get out of here.

01:20:09.560 --> 01:20:11.560
Well...

01:20:11.560 --> 01:20:13.560
I have no grenades.

01:20:13.560 --> 01:20:15.560
Do you...

01:20:15.560 --> 01:20:17.560
I have a feeling I'm supposed to do something.

01:20:17.560 --> 01:20:19.560
No, you're just a hawk.

01:20:19.560 --> 01:20:21.560
You know, I mean, anything that you can conceive

01:20:21.560 --> 01:20:23.560
of doing as a hawk. Great.

01:20:23.560 --> 01:20:25.560
Um... Gas hawk.

01:20:27.560 --> 01:20:29.560
We nest.

01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:33.560
We have very good eyesight. I notice there's

01:20:33.560 --> 01:20:35.560
a ring on the finger. Yeah, you could...

01:20:35.560 --> 01:20:37.560
You could peck at things. You could fly in attack

01:20:37.560 --> 01:20:39.560
with beak and talons. Yeah, so you're inside

01:20:39.560 --> 01:20:41.560
this robot also looking around at all these

01:20:41.560 --> 01:20:43.560
weird glowing stuff, but being a bird

01:20:43.560 --> 01:20:45.560
you don't really get what it means.

01:20:45.560 --> 01:20:47.560
Also, he doesn't have the brain

01:20:47.560 --> 01:20:49.560
of a non-hawk. He doesn't have the brain

01:20:49.560 --> 01:20:51.560
of Mitch Hurlitz. Well, even your

01:20:51.560 --> 01:20:53.560
character wouldn't really understand

01:20:53.560 --> 01:20:55.560
the inside of a golem, you know? Sure.

01:20:55.560 --> 01:20:57.560
Well, fuck this thing. I'm shocking grasping

01:20:57.560 --> 01:20:59.560
the heart. Fine. I'll take my

01:20:59.560 --> 01:21:01.560
heat damage, but it's going to get some

01:21:01.560 --> 01:21:03.560
damage in response. I'm

01:21:03.560 --> 01:21:05.560
defibrillating this

01:21:05.560 --> 01:21:07.560
MF. But that's a good thing.

01:21:07.560 --> 01:21:09.560
You don't want to do that. Only if he's

01:21:09.560 --> 01:21:11.560
dead, it's like a toggle.

01:21:11.560 --> 01:21:13.560
You ever defibrillate

01:21:13.560 --> 01:21:15.560
a live person? Smart.

01:21:15.560 --> 01:21:17.560
Yeah. You have

01:21:17.560 --> 01:21:19.560
the hawk seal of approval on that one.

01:21:19.560 --> 01:21:21.560
Thank you. It's like a toggle.

01:21:23.560 --> 01:21:25.560
Can I ask you a question?

01:21:25.560 --> 01:21:27.560
Please. I know you can

01:21:27.560 --> 01:21:29.560
see really far, but up close

01:21:29.560 --> 01:21:31.560
I don't read a lot.

01:21:31.560 --> 01:21:33.560
No, I don't.

01:21:33.560 --> 01:21:35.560
All right. Shocking grasping

01:21:35.560 --> 01:21:37.560
the heart. Grasping

01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:39.560
the heart.

01:21:39.560 --> 01:21:41.560
If you hold the book really far away, but

01:21:41.560 --> 01:21:43.560
you know what I mean? Then I'm circling and I'm trying to

01:21:43.560 --> 01:21:45.560
and I can't track the narrative.

01:21:45.560 --> 01:21:47.560
I can't track the narrative.

01:21:47.560 --> 01:21:49.560
Just cream turned to pay. You're far away.

01:21:49.560 --> 01:21:51.560
You can't. Yeah, you can't.

01:21:51.560 --> 01:21:53.560
I've been reading the corrections for about seven years.

01:21:53.560 --> 01:21:55.560
Of what?

01:21:55.560 --> 01:21:57.560
I think many people have.

01:21:57.560 --> 01:21:59.560
All right.

01:21:59.560 --> 01:22:01.560
You grab the heart thing.

01:22:01.560 --> 01:22:03.560
It starts being electrified.

01:22:03.560 --> 01:22:05.560
It takes 17 damage.

01:22:07.560 --> 01:22:09.560
It's heart damage.

01:22:09.560 --> 01:22:11.560
Can I ask where is

01:22:11.560 --> 01:22:13.560
Admiral Darkstart at this point? Well, his head

01:22:13.560 --> 01:22:15.560
got taken off and

01:22:15.560 --> 01:22:17.560
yeah, you don't know where he went.

01:22:17.560 --> 01:22:19.560
He kind of turned into gas also.

01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:21.560
There's a lot of gas.

01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:23.560
Am I being grasped upstairs by the arm?

01:22:23.560 --> 01:22:25.560
No, you slipped out of its grasp.

01:22:25.560 --> 01:22:27.560
Okay, I go into a barbarian rage.

01:22:27.560 --> 01:22:29.560
Yeah, okay. As I do.

01:22:29.560 --> 01:22:31.560
Twice a day.

01:22:31.560 --> 01:22:33.560
And I take my mighty greatsword

01:22:33.560 --> 01:22:35.560
and I try to chop off the arm

01:22:35.560 --> 01:22:37.560
and see if that severs any, if robots bleed

01:22:37.560 --> 01:22:39.560
out of their arteries like

01:22:39.560 --> 01:22:41.560
mortal beings do.

01:22:41.560 --> 01:22:43.560
This one doesn't.

01:22:43.560 --> 01:22:45.560
Well, shit.

01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:47.560
Yeah, you cleave into its arm

01:22:47.560 --> 01:22:49.560
and it planks off of its arm

01:22:49.560 --> 01:22:51.560
as if it didn't take any damage

01:22:51.560 --> 01:22:53.560
or get hurt in any way.

01:22:55.560 --> 01:22:57.560
This sucks.

01:22:57.560 --> 01:22:59.560
I say, ah-fooey.

01:22:59.560 --> 01:23:01.560
In a rage.

01:23:03.560 --> 01:23:05.560
It is going to be one of those things where it's like, oh, send

01:23:05.560 --> 01:23:07.560
the hawk down to make friends with it, but I

01:23:07.560 --> 01:23:09.560
No, we've tried to make

01:23:09.560 --> 01:23:11.560
friends every time with something and it always

01:23:11.560 --> 01:23:13.560
we've done, we've put on shows for them.

01:23:15.560 --> 01:23:17.560
And you're inside its chest with me

01:23:17.560 --> 01:23:19.560
like, burning to death.

01:23:19.560 --> 01:23:21.560
I'm in there with you.

01:23:21.560 --> 01:23:23.560
And you're in a gaseous state right now.

01:23:23.560 --> 01:23:25.560
We're not really gaseous.

01:23:25.560 --> 01:23:27.560
Nah, you guys are back.

01:23:27.560 --> 01:23:29.560
We're re-solidified, but we're inside a robot's chest

01:23:29.560 --> 01:23:31.560
just hanging out.

01:23:31.560 --> 01:23:33.560
Do we try to shaking it?

01:23:33.560 --> 01:23:35.560
Shaking its heart?

01:23:35.560 --> 01:23:37.560
I tried to electrocute its heart.

01:23:37.560 --> 01:23:39.560
Yeah, if you can view

01:23:39.560 --> 01:23:41.560
the hawk abilities, you could go look for

01:23:41.560 --> 01:23:43.560
other vital organs.

01:23:43.560 --> 01:23:45.560
Hawks are very fatty birds

01:23:45.560 --> 01:23:47.560
and maybe we just

01:23:47.560 --> 01:23:49.560
cholesterol them.

01:23:49.560 --> 01:23:51.560
We just get those HDLs up.

01:23:51.560 --> 01:23:53.560
LDLs.

01:23:53.560 --> 01:23:55.560
I don't know if that's important.

01:23:55.560 --> 01:23:57.560
In the spirit of Thanksgiving, I will let him

01:23:57.560 --> 01:23:59.560
eat me.

01:23:59.560 --> 01:24:01.560
Spencer, can I

01:24:01.560 --> 01:24:03.560
use my armlet of summer to ignite

01:24:03.560 --> 01:24:05.560
my firearm?

01:24:05.560 --> 01:24:07.560
Yeah, you're already on firearm.

01:24:07.560 --> 01:24:09.560
I thought so, but I was just making sure.

01:24:09.560 --> 01:24:11.560
I run up to

01:24:11.560 --> 01:24:13.560
his neck

01:24:13.560 --> 01:24:15.560
and I say, heads up!

01:24:15.560 --> 01:24:17.560
I grab my

01:24:17.560 --> 01:24:19.560
fiery arms around his neck.

01:24:19.560 --> 01:24:21.560
And then I call out for Avenger.

01:24:21.560 --> 01:24:23.560
Avenger!

01:24:23.560 --> 01:24:25.560
That's to you.

01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:27.560
Oh, I'm sorry, I was just listening to some

01:24:27.560 --> 01:24:29.560
Christe Berge.

01:24:29.560 --> 01:24:31.560
And what do I do?

01:24:31.560 --> 01:24:33.560
Avenger, fly

01:24:33.560 --> 01:24:35.560
into his neck and peck at his innards.

01:24:35.560 --> 01:24:37.560
Well, I got to get out.

01:24:37.560 --> 01:24:39.560
If you can.

01:24:39.560 --> 01:24:41.560
Or fly up through here.

01:24:41.560 --> 01:24:43.560
While you're holding him, I'm going to do that.

01:24:43.560 --> 01:24:45.560
I'm going to fly in, I'm going to peck it.

01:24:45.560 --> 01:24:47.560
You're already in so you can just go up to the head.

01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:49.560
I'm around the outside.

01:24:49.560 --> 01:24:51.560
I have my fiery arms around his neck.

01:24:51.560 --> 01:24:53.560
So I'm burning from the outside.

01:24:53.560 --> 01:24:55.560
Maybe from the inside you can do

01:24:55.560 --> 01:24:57.560
like a reverse phone booth

01:24:57.560 --> 01:24:59.560
peck from birds

01:24:59.560 --> 01:25:01.560
on his neck.

01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:03.560
You know, I go

01:25:03.560 --> 01:25:05.560
and I do an interesting sort of

01:25:05.560 --> 01:25:07.560
beak dance

01:25:07.560 --> 01:25:09.560
in his esophagus.

01:25:09.560 --> 01:25:11.560
Your interesting

01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:13.560
set of beak dance, as you put it.

01:25:13.560 --> 01:25:15.560
Yeah, is that in your thing

01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:17.560
anywhere?

01:25:17.560 --> 01:25:19.560
Mitch, what you don't know is that I've read

01:25:19.560 --> 01:25:21.560
all the books and so like, I know all these

01:25:21.560 --> 01:25:23.560
extra things.

01:25:23.560 --> 01:25:25.560
Yeah, you roll three die

01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:27.560
for that. But I have talons.

01:25:27.560 --> 01:25:29.560
I have talons, I can scratch at it,

01:25:29.560 --> 01:25:31.560
I can create some esophageal bleeding.

01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:33.560
What is the DC on beak dance?

01:25:33.560 --> 01:25:35.560
I mean,

01:25:35.560 --> 01:25:37.560
really like 26.

01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:39.560
That's not a funny thing at all.

01:25:39.560 --> 01:25:41.560
No, it's funny because you had an answer.

01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:45.560
But yeah, the talons

01:25:45.560 --> 01:25:47.560
not so hot against metal

01:25:47.560 --> 01:25:49.560
as it happens. But my armor?

01:25:49.560 --> 01:25:51.560
Yeah, it heats it up.

01:25:51.560 --> 01:25:53.560
But it doesn't do much

01:25:53.560 --> 01:25:55.560
more than that. So it's hot

01:25:55.560 --> 01:25:57.560
now. Okay, so where

01:25:57.560 --> 01:25:59.560
I am?

01:25:59.560 --> 01:26:01.560
I'm just watching all this happen.

01:26:01.560 --> 01:26:03.560
I guess.

01:26:03.560 --> 01:26:05.560
And I have no way to get

01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:07.560
into any weak parts of the robot

01:26:07.560 --> 01:26:09.560
from where I am. I mean, not where you know

01:26:09.560 --> 01:26:11.560
of. You're up on

01:26:11.560 --> 01:26:13.560
the second floor with the hand

01:26:13.560 --> 01:26:15.560
with quark. Oh, and the hand still.

01:26:15.560 --> 01:26:17.560
Yeah.

01:26:17.560 --> 01:26:19.560
You're above the other guys.

01:26:19.560 --> 01:26:21.560
Okay, well

01:26:21.560 --> 01:26:23.560
but I

01:26:23.560 --> 01:26:25.560
tell me, can I use a bola

01:26:25.560 --> 01:26:27.560
to snare the

01:26:27.560 --> 01:26:29.560
hand and render it immobile?

01:26:29.560 --> 01:26:31.560
You can definitely

01:26:31.560 --> 01:26:33.560
try. What do you guys think? Is that a fun?

01:26:33.560 --> 01:26:35.560
You're going to snare it to something

01:26:35.560 --> 01:26:37.560
or just tie its fingers together or what?

01:26:37.560 --> 01:26:39.560
Yeah, yeah.

01:26:39.560 --> 01:26:41.560
That's it.

01:26:41.560 --> 01:26:43.560
But I mean, I'm sort

01:26:43.560 --> 01:26:45.560
of a rope based combatant, so I really

01:26:45.560 --> 01:26:47.560
want to work this in.

01:26:47.560 --> 01:26:49.560
So I take the, what the

01:26:49.560 --> 01:26:51.560
bola is there no way?

01:26:51.560 --> 01:26:53.560
It wouldn't fit around the arm probably.

01:26:53.560 --> 01:26:55.560
Oh, okay. Is there any, anybody have

01:26:55.560 --> 01:26:57.560
any magnetism or anything like that?

01:26:57.560 --> 01:26:59.560
I have

01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:01.560
bones. There's an electrical system we could

01:27:01.560 --> 01:27:03.560
disrupt. I'm very charismatic.

01:27:03.560 --> 01:27:05.560
You

01:27:05.560 --> 01:27:07.560
have your arms around his neck.

01:27:07.560 --> 01:27:09.560
I think that ship has sailed.

01:27:09.560 --> 01:27:11.560
But can I

01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:13.560
try using my talents together? There's some kind

01:27:13.560 --> 01:27:15.560
of wiring. There must be some. There aren't

01:27:15.560 --> 01:27:17.560
actually any wires. There aren't wires? No,

01:27:17.560 --> 01:27:19.560
see, you tried that last week, Dan. So this

01:27:19.560 --> 01:27:21.560
is the six. I was drunk. Yeah.

01:27:21.560 --> 01:27:23.560
Well, this is the new one. He has the

01:27:23.560 --> 01:27:25.560
liar of building.

01:27:25.560 --> 01:27:27.560
Oh, who is?

01:27:27.560 --> 01:27:29.560
Okay, well, guess what, buddy? Yeah.

01:27:29.560 --> 01:27:31.560
Let me know when it's my turn, because I just

01:27:31.560 --> 01:27:33.560
found it.

01:27:33.560 --> 01:27:35.560
I think it's Coomel's turn,

01:27:35.560 --> 01:27:37.560
but if he doesn't want to do anything.

01:27:37.560 --> 01:27:39.560
Who is the liar of building? Is that a thing

01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:41.560
that's useful? If no one knows, I'll say it's

01:27:41.560 --> 01:27:43.560
you. Me? Yeah.

01:27:43.560 --> 01:27:45.560
So can I just build a

01:27:45.560 --> 01:27:47.560
building under the robot and just

01:27:47.560 --> 01:27:49.560
fucking

01:27:49.560 --> 01:27:51.560
just fucking

01:27:51.560 --> 01:27:53.560
grow a building through his whole

01:27:53.560 --> 01:27:55.560
fucking body? Maybe like an obelisk.

01:27:55.560 --> 01:27:57.560
It'd take like a long, long

01:27:57.560 --> 01:27:59.560
time.

01:27:59.560 --> 01:28:01.560
How long? Like a half hour.

01:28:01.560 --> 01:28:03.560
You know, but with some

01:28:03.560 --> 01:28:05.560
of these liar buildings, it's like

01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:07.560
a thousand human hours.

01:28:07.560 --> 01:28:09.560
So

01:28:09.560 --> 01:28:11.560
you're saving. Yeah, I don't know if you took

01:28:11.560 --> 01:28:13.560
that into account. I don't know if you

01:28:13.560 --> 01:28:15.560
heard that part. It's definitely

01:28:15.560 --> 01:28:17.560
a wondrous construction.

01:28:17.560 --> 01:28:19.560
Okay. Well, you know what?

01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:21.560
I don't... Dan,

01:28:21.560 --> 01:28:23.560
I got a little

01:28:23.560 --> 01:28:25.560
sharpie. Go for it.

01:28:25.560 --> 01:28:27.560
Give it a try. Sharpie.

01:28:29.560 --> 01:28:31.560
Quick question.

01:28:31.560 --> 01:28:33.560
This is like

01:28:33.560 --> 01:28:35.560
Clarence Darrow closing an argument.

01:28:35.560 --> 01:28:37.560
This is...

01:28:37.560 --> 01:28:39.560
Would you say this item that I'm

01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:41.560
standing in front of is his heart?

01:28:41.560 --> 01:28:43.560
No, it's a golem.

01:28:43.560 --> 01:28:45.560
It's not like a shark. No, but I'm saying

01:28:45.560 --> 01:28:47.560
I like how you're already backtracking.

01:28:47.560 --> 01:28:49.560
I'm inside of it.

01:28:49.560 --> 01:28:51.560
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm saying like, would you

01:28:51.560 --> 01:28:53.560
say that this item that I'm standing

01:28:53.560 --> 01:28:55.560
in front of is its heart?

01:28:55.560 --> 01:28:57.560
No.

01:28:57.560 --> 01:28:59.560
This

01:28:59.560 --> 01:29:01.560
big red thing that's like burning me.

01:29:01.560 --> 01:29:03.560
Using your knowledge, Arcana,

01:29:03.560 --> 01:29:05.560
you determine it to be some sort of

01:29:05.560 --> 01:29:07.560
heat emission weapon device.

01:29:07.560 --> 01:29:09.560
Not a heart.

01:29:09.560 --> 01:29:11.560
So you're saying this item

01:29:11.560 --> 01:29:13.560
isn't a heart? No, it's more of a heat

01:29:13.560 --> 01:29:15.560
emission sort of weapon.

01:29:15.560 --> 01:29:17.560
So you admit it's an item.

01:29:17.560 --> 01:29:19.560
I shrink

01:29:19.560 --> 01:29:21.560
item.

01:29:21.560 --> 01:29:23.560
Oh, nice.

01:29:23.560 --> 01:29:25.560
Wow.

01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:27.560
Item shrinks to 1.16

01:29:27.560 --> 01:29:29.560
normal size. Clarence Darrow.

01:29:29.560 --> 01:29:31.560
It sure does.

01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:33.560
As you wave your arms about

01:29:33.560 --> 01:29:35.560
Conjurus Minimus

01:29:37.560 --> 01:29:39.560
and speak the magical catchphrase

01:29:39.560 --> 01:29:41.560
before your very eyes, the heat

01:29:41.560 --> 01:29:43.560
emission object dwindles in

01:29:43.560 --> 01:29:45.560
size. It dwindles and dwindles

01:29:45.560 --> 01:29:47.560
and dwindles to about

01:29:47.560 --> 01:29:49.560
1.16

01:29:49.560 --> 01:29:51.560
1.16

01:29:51.560 --> 01:29:53.560
of its original size.

01:29:53.560 --> 01:29:55.560
It begins glowing brightly and

01:29:55.560 --> 01:29:57.560
emits the heat of maybe a toaster

01:29:57.560 --> 01:29:59.560
or something non-lethal.

01:30:01.560 --> 01:30:03.560
I turn to Avenger and I'm like,

01:30:03.560 --> 01:30:05.560
let's make some toast.

01:30:07.560 --> 01:30:09.560
Let's eat a little something

01:30:09.560 --> 01:30:13.560
and then we'll celebrate.

01:30:13.560 --> 01:30:15.560
Avenger, I

01:30:15.560 --> 01:30:17.560
love the rest of the development.

01:30:17.560 --> 01:30:19.560
Oh, that's so nice. Thank you.

01:30:19.560 --> 01:30:21.560
I was cut from the pilot, but I was

01:30:21.560 --> 01:30:23.560
circling the boat in the first scene.

01:30:27.560 --> 01:30:29.560
Wait, does that kill the robot?

01:30:29.560 --> 01:30:31.560
Nope.

01:30:31.560 --> 01:30:33.560
Because it's not his heart.

01:30:33.560 --> 01:30:35.560
But it's an item.

01:30:35.560 --> 01:30:37.560
That was really good.

01:30:37.560 --> 01:30:39.560
Yeah, definitely.

01:30:39.560 --> 01:30:41.560
Spencer,

01:30:41.560 --> 01:30:43.560
I want to do a power attack at his wrist

01:30:43.560 --> 01:30:45.560
and pour water into it.

01:30:45.560 --> 01:30:47.560
There's no wires, it's magic.

01:30:47.560 --> 01:30:49.560
It's gold.

01:30:49.560 --> 01:30:51.560
It's a gown.

01:30:51.560 --> 01:30:53.560
Okay, I tried this.

01:30:53.560 --> 01:30:55.560
Is the arm coming through a hole

01:30:55.560 --> 01:30:57.560
that just fits his arm or is there space

01:30:57.560 --> 01:30:59.560
around the hole? No, there's space.

01:30:59.560 --> 01:31:01.560
Okay, I try to stick

01:31:01.560 --> 01:31:03.560
my greatsword into it

01:31:03.560 --> 01:31:05.560
and slide down his wrist like

01:31:05.560 --> 01:31:07.560
Douglas Fairbanks done a sale.

01:31:07.560 --> 01:31:09.560
Yeah.

01:31:09.560 --> 01:31:11.560
Down the road, as they say.

01:31:11.560 --> 01:31:13.560
Okay, I didn't know that.

01:31:13.560 --> 01:31:15.560
What did he call it? Down the road?

01:31:15.560 --> 01:31:17.560
Down the road is what that's called?

01:31:17.560 --> 01:31:19.560
Yeah.

01:31:19.560 --> 01:31:21.560
It's a cutting reference.

01:31:23.560 --> 01:31:25.560
Oh, it's a suicide.

01:31:25.560 --> 01:31:27.560
It's a crime rose, and it's a suicide, Joe.

01:31:27.560 --> 01:31:29.560
No, not suicide. Well, I guess if you go

01:31:29.560 --> 01:31:31.560
down the road, it is suicide.

01:31:31.560 --> 01:31:33.560
I didn't know that, but half of our audience did.

01:31:33.560 --> 01:31:35.560
We have a lot of...

01:31:35.560 --> 01:31:37.560
No one is surprised at that.

01:31:37.560 --> 01:31:39.560
It's the Tumblr generation.

01:31:39.560 --> 01:31:41.560
Do we need to do a sound effect where we all gasp?

01:31:43.560 --> 01:31:45.560
Oh, my God, Spencer's showing us.

01:31:47.560 --> 01:31:51.560
All right, I try to go down the road, man.

01:31:51.560 --> 01:31:53.560
You do this as you say it.

01:31:55.560 --> 01:31:57.560
It does some damage, let's see here.

01:31:57.560 --> 01:31:59.560
Am I sliding down his wrist?

01:31:59.560 --> 01:32:01.560
Oh, yeah, it's breaking your fall

01:32:01.560 --> 01:32:03.560
as you're cutting it open

01:32:03.560 --> 01:32:05.560
like a can of meat.

01:32:05.560 --> 01:32:07.560
Does meat come in a can?

01:32:07.560 --> 01:32:09.560
Sometimes. Spam, spam, corned beef.

01:32:09.560 --> 01:32:11.560
Spam's not really.

01:32:11.560 --> 01:32:13.560
Well, I mean, let's not get spam on around.

01:32:13.560 --> 01:32:15.560
It's not the first example I would come up with

01:32:15.560 --> 01:32:17.560
when I was coming up with stuff that's in a can.

01:32:17.560 --> 01:32:19.560
But meat works.

01:32:19.560 --> 01:32:21.560
Yeah, yeah, you know.

01:32:21.560 --> 01:32:23.560
Meat in a can.

01:32:23.560 --> 01:32:25.560
So you do that. It does...

01:32:25.560 --> 01:32:27.560
What was that? 15.

01:32:27.560 --> 01:32:29.560
18 damage.

01:32:29.560 --> 01:32:31.560
All right.

01:32:31.560 --> 01:32:33.560
And you find yourself, you know,

01:32:33.560 --> 01:32:35.560
halfway down its arm.

01:32:35.560 --> 01:32:37.560
Am I down to the lower level now?

01:32:37.560 --> 01:32:39.560
I'm sure I'm just kind of suspended around his ulna

01:32:39.560 --> 01:32:41.560
or what, so like...

01:32:41.560 --> 01:32:43.560
Yeah, his ulna.

01:32:43.560 --> 01:32:45.560
It does 18 damage to a thing

01:32:45.560 --> 01:32:47.560
with 1.16 its heart.

01:32:47.560 --> 01:32:49.560
Is that a heart?

01:32:49.560 --> 01:32:51.560
It's a heat emission device.

01:32:51.560 --> 01:32:53.560
It's a hot thing

01:32:53.560 --> 01:32:55.560
that powers it in its chest.

01:32:55.560 --> 01:32:57.560
Does it power it?

01:32:57.560 --> 01:32:59.560
No.

01:32:59.560 --> 01:33:01.560
It's a weapon emission.

01:33:01.560 --> 01:33:03.560
It's just a defense mechanism.

01:33:03.560 --> 01:33:05.560
From two floors up, I yell,

01:33:05.560 --> 01:33:07.560
It's not as fucking hard!

01:33:11.560 --> 01:33:13.560
And then I feel immediately

01:33:13.560 --> 01:33:15.560
bad.

01:33:15.560 --> 01:33:17.560
I go back,

01:33:17.560 --> 01:33:19.560
I'm doing God's work in here!

01:33:21.560 --> 01:33:23.560
I don't care how long it takes.

01:33:23.560 --> 01:33:25.560
The monster shifts.

01:33:25.560 --> 01:33:27.560
It's not a monster.

01:33:27.560 --> 01:33:29.560
It's a fucking whatever.

01:33:29.560 --> 01:33:31.560
The automaton shifts

01:33:31.560 --> 01:33:33.560
as its shoulder is now being occupied.

01:33:33.560 --> 01:33:35.560
It tries to extricate its arm,

01:33:35.560 --> 01:33:37.560
but it can't seem to get it.

01:33:37.560 --> 01:33:39.560
It's all messed up from being all sliced open

01:33:39.560 --> 01:33:41.560
and whatnot.

01:33:41.560 --> 01:33:43.560
And from the shrinking its red thing.

01:33:43.560 --> 01:33:45.560
No.

01:33:45.560 --> 01:33:47.560
Not a heart.

01:33:47.560 --> 01:33:49.560
I'll just let you...

01:33:49.560 --> 01:33:51.560
Avenger, I feel like what I did was important.

01:33:51.560 --> 01:33:53.560
You know, so much of this is

01:33:53.560 --> 01:33:55.560
filtered through a bird's eyes,

01:33:55.560 --> 01:33:57.560
but it's, to me,

01:33:57.560 --> 01:33:59.560
I really,

01:33:59.560 --> 01:34:01.560
I respected it.

01:34:01.560 --> 01:34:03.560
I chose you as a familiar

01:34:03.560 --> 01:34:05.560
because I feel like everything you've done is important, too.

01:34:05.560 --> 01:34:07.560
I haven't done much.

01:34:07.560 --> 01:34:09.560
I've done some circling.

01:34:09.560 --> 01:34:11.560
I made some comments about a beak dance.

01:34:11.560 --> 01:34:13.560
That got some...

01:34:13.560 --> 01:34:15.560
You underplay it.

01:34:15.560 --> 01:34:17.560
You inspire me.

01:34:17.560 --> 01:34:19.560
Oh, then fuck it.

01:34:19.560 --> 01:34:21.560
Why do we want to hurt this thing?

01:34:21.560 --> 01:34:23.560
I mean...

01:34:23.560 --> 01:34:25.560
This robot?

01:34:25.560 --> 01:34:27.560
I say dumb things.

01:34:27.560 --> 01:34:29.560
I say dumb things.

01:34:29.560 --> 01:34:31.560
Okay.

01:34:31.560 --> 01:34:33.560
Robots fight flailing around.

01:34:33.560 --> 01:34:35.560
It's SWAT netchy, guys,

01:34:35.560 --> 01:34:37.560
but it's missing. It's not hitting you.

01:34:37.560 --> 01:34:39.560
Nice.

01:34:39.560 --> 01:34:41.560
I'm still

01:34:41.560 --> 01:34:43.560
by his neck, right?

01:34:43.560 --> 01:34:45.560
Hugging it.

01:34:45.560 --> 01:34:47.560
I'm going to use...

01:34:47.560 --> 01:34:49.560
I'm going to release the heat.

01:34:49.560 --> 01:34:51.560
So to speak.

01:34:51.560 --> 01:34:53.560
Also,

01:34:53.560 --> 01:34:55.560
the name of my WWE wrestling character.

01:34:55.560 --> 01:34:57.560
I'm going to release the heat.

01:34:57.560 --> 01:34:59.560
And I'm going to

01:34:59.560 --> 01:35:01.560
use my

01:35:01.560 --> 01:35:03.560
very high diplomacy.

01:35:03.560 --> 01:35:05.560
And I'm going to say,

01:35:05.560 --> 01:35:07.560
Hey!

01:35:07.560 --> 01:35:09.560
Shut down!

01:35:13.560 --> 01:35:15.560
Huh?

01:35:15.560 --> 01:35:17.560
I need to roll dice for that.

01:35:17.560 --> 01:35:19.560
No!

01:35:19.560 --> 01:35:21.560
I'm going to file this under W for a worth of shot.

01:35:21.560 --> 01:35:23.560
Yeah.

01:35:23.560 --> 01:35:25.560
They drop Siri from these things

01:35:25.560 --> 01:35:27.560
a couple of weeks ago.

01:35:27.560 --> 01:35:29.560
So they don't...

01:35:29.560 --> 01:35:31.560
I'll add...

01:35:31.560 --> 01:35:33.560
We...

01:35:33.560 --> 01:35:35.560
There is a mix-up.

01:35:35.560 --> 01:35:37.560
We talked

01:35:37.560 --> 01:35:39.560
to your master

01:35:39.560 --> 01:35:41.560
and they...

01:35:41.560 --> 01:35:43.560
You're actually the welcoming committee.

01:35:43.560 --> 01:35:45.560
All is forgiven.

01:35:45.560 --> 01:35:47.560
Yeah.

01:35:47.560 --> 01:35:49.560
We forgive you.

01:35:49.560 --> 01:35:51.560
Yeah.

01:35:51.560 --> 01:35:53.560
It's totally fine.

01:35:53.560 --> 01:35:55.560
We placated you for a little while

01:35:55.560 --> 01:35:57.560
because we know this is what you do

01:35:57.560 --> 01:35:59.560
when we don't want to insult your strength

01:35:59.560 --> 01:36:01.560
or your mechanism.

01:36:01.560 --> 01:36:03.560
And while she's saying it's me with my sword in its elbow,

01:36:03.560 --> 01:36:05.560
I go, yeah, we forgive you.

01:36:05.560 --> 01:36:07.560
Test successful.

01:36:07.560 --> 01:36:09.560
Test successful.

01:36:09.560 --> 01:36:11.560
So if you could just lower us down

01:36:11.560 --> 01:36:13.560
and show us the way out of here,

01:36:13.560 --> 01:36:15.560
that would be...

01:36:15.560 --> 01:36:17.560
I start thinking Lady in Red

01:36:17.560 --> 01:36:19.560
just to be like, hey, this sounds familiar, right?

01:36:19.560 --> 01:36:21.560
Yeah.

01:36:21.560 --> 01:36:23.560
Resume glow job mode.

01:36:23.560 --> 01:36:25.560
As per

01:36:25.560 --> 01:36:27.560
your ordinary protocol.

01:36:27.560 --> 01:36:29.560
Which is what we know you were designed for

01:36:29.560 --> 01:36:31.560
originally. Just based on your lips.

01:36:31.560 --> 01:36:33.560
Based on that architecture.

01:36:33.560 --> 01:36:35.560
Based on those DSLs, yeah.

01:36:35.560 --> 01:36:37.560
The first DSL.

01:36:37.560 --> 01:36:39.560
And really quick with my craft kit,

01:36:39.560 --> 01:36:41.560
my God's eye.

01:36:41.560 --> 01:36:43.560
And I say, hey, we shrunk

01:36:43.560 --> 01:36:45.560
one of your items, but now you're making one

01:36:45.560 --> 01:36:47.560
of my items grow.

01:36:51.560 --> 01:36:53.560
And I kind of just look at it for a while

01:36:53.560 --> 01:36:55.560
like, anything?

01:36:55.560 --> 01:36:57.560
I mean, I know Chris, whatever,

01:36:57.560 --> 01:36:59.560
DeBerg isn't the sexiest

01:36:59.560 --> 01:37:01.560
man in America right now.

01:37:01.560 --> 01:37:03.560
But it has an effect.

01:37:03.560 --> 01:37:05.560
Imagine that

01:37:05.560 --> 01:37:07.560
Camille.

01:37:07.560 --> 01:37:09.560
I don't have any barra bat mitzvahs coming up.

01:37:09.560 --> 01:37:11.560
I'm sure he would be totally willing

01:37:11.560 --> 01:37:13.560
to perform at them.

01:37:13.560 --> 01:37:15.560
So, what is...

01:37:15.560 --> 01:37:17.560
Sorry, everybody. How is...

01:37:17.560 --> 01:37:19.560
How is the gollum robot?

01:37:19.560 --> 01:37:21.560
Come on, Spencer, play D&D with us.

01:37:21.560 --> 01:37:23.560
Can we roll the dice?

01:37:23.560 --> 01:37:25.560
How's gollum robot? How's his robot?

01:37:25.560 --> 01:37:27.560
Respond all of it.

01:37:27.560 --> 01:37:29.560
You keep looking at me.

01:37:29.560 --> 01:37:31.560
Come on, we told you what we did.

01:37:31.560 --> 01:37:33.560
Now tell us

01:37:33.560 --> 01:37:35.560
what he does.

01:37:35.560 --> 01:37:37.560
Hard facts are that I have

01:37:37.560 --> 01:37:39.560
very high diplomacy.

01:37:39.560 --> 01:37:41.560
Hard facts!

01:37:41.560 --> 01:37:43.560
These are the hard facts,

01:37:43.560 --> 01:37:45.560
gentlemen.

01:37:47.560 --> 01:37:49.560
These sats don't lie.

01:37:49.560 --> 01:37:51.560
Does that mean something different

01:37:51.560 --> 01:37:53.560
than I think it means?

01:37:53.560 --> 01:37:55.560
No, no, I'm supporting you.

01:37:55.560 --> 01:37:57.560
I think Indians, you know,

01:37:57.560 --> 01:37:59.560
will perform.

01:37:59.560 --> 01:38:01.560
While this happens,

01:38:01.560 --> 01:38:03.560
my sword that's in his arm

01:38:03.560 --> 01:38:05.560
is horizontal.

01:38:05.560 --> 01:38:07.560
It's just my dad.

01:38:07.560 --> 01:38:09.560
I thought it was still

01:38:09.560 --> 01:38:11.560
Jim Belushi.

01:38:13.560 --> 01:38:15.560
It was Jim trying to do

01:38:15.560 --> 01:38:17.560
his brother's karate character in the back.

01:38:17.560 --> 01:38:19.560
As this is happening,

01:38:19.560 --> 01:38:21.560
I'm sitting on my sword like a little bird perch.

01:38:21.560 --> 01:38:23.560
He's just a killer bean.

01:38:23.560 --> 01:38:25.560
He's like, well, I'll practice

01:38:25.560 --> 01:38:27.560
and then I'll show them.

01:38:27.560 --> 01:38:29.560
Just to add to it,

01:38:29.560 --> 01:38:31.560
I'm sitting on my sword like a little bird perch

01:38:31.560 --> 01:38:33.560
and I take out my lute of charming

01:38:33.560 --> 01:38:35.560
and I play that to charm him as well.

01:38:35.560 --> 01:38:37.560
Okay, all right.

01:38:37.560 --> 01:38:39.560
And I take out my ribbon dagger

01:38:39.560 --> 01:38:41.560
and I hold the knife in my hand

01:38:41.560 --> 01:38:43.560
and I kind of do like a twirling ribbon dance.

01:38:43.560 --> 01:38:45.560
You know, like it looks beautiful.

01:38:45.560 --> 01:38:47.560
I do it great.

01:38:47.560 --> 01:38:49.560
You know, and I get out a little

01:38:49.560 --> 01:38:51.560
typewriter and I start

01:38:51.560 --> 01:38:53.560
writing something.

01:38:53.560 --> 01:38:55.560
This is what I write.

01:38:55.560 --> 01:38:57.560
Day three.

01:38:57.560 --> 01:38:59.560
What's up with rice?

01:38:59.560 --> 01:39:01.560
That's dates not beans.

01:39:03.560 --> 01:39:05.560
All right.

01:39:05.560 --> 01:39:07.560
Some country chronicles.

01:39:07.560 --> 01:39:09.560
Why don't you start with day three?

01:39:09.560 --> 01:39:11.560
You had just taken it out.

01:39:11.560 --> 01:39:13.560
It's an immediate result, however you say it.

01:39:13.560 --> 01:39:15.560
I don't have to tell you

01:39:15.560 --> 01:39:17.560
when I start my journal.

01:39:17.560 --> 01:39:19.560
Anyway.

01:39:19.560 --> 01:39:21.560
Deep within the hero's hearts,

01:39:21.560 --> 01:39:23.560
they must have realized that somehow

01:39:23.560 --> 01:39:25.560
this wouldn't be effective in any way.

01:39:25.560 --> 01:39:27.560
I'm excited.

01:39:27.560 --> 01:39:29.560
I'm excited.

01:39:29.560 --> 01:39:31.560
Not excited.

01:39:33.560 --> 01:39:35.560
However...

01:39:41.560 --> 01:39:43.560
Go on.

01:39:43.560 --> 01:39:45.560
Because it's Thanksgiving.

01:39:47.560 --> 01:39:49.560
Just as there's not normally

01:39:49.560 --> 01:39:51.560
a Hong Kong Fooie

01:39:51.560 --> 01:39:55.560
on Macy Street.

01:39:57.560 --> 01:39:59.560
That was the end of your

01:39:59.560 --> 01:40:01.560
pronouncement. Yeah, nothing happens.

01:40:01.560 --> 01:40:03.560
All right, fine.

01:40:03.560 --> 01:40:05.560
We'll show you.

01:40:05.560 --> 01:40:07.560
We were sitting and talking.

01:40:07.560 --> 01:40:09.560
I do everything by the book.

01:40:09.560 --> 01:40:11.560
My character does everything

01:40:11.560 --> 01:40:13.560
by the book for the rest of his life.

01:40:13.560 --> 01:40:15.560
Every child he has

01:40:15.560 --> 01:40:17.560
he's got a certain amount of hit dice

01:40:17.560 --> 01:40:19.560
and he does everything just normally

01:40:19.560 --> 01:40:21.560
by the numbers.

01:40:21.560 --> 01:40:23.560
He does everything

01:40:23.560 --> 01:40:25.560
by the book.

01:40:25.560 --> 01:40:27.560
Avenger?

01:40:27.560 --> 01:40:29.560
I was helping somebody with it.

01:40:31.560 --> 01:40:33.560
Then the book...

01:40:33.560 --> 01:40:35.560
Then write down...

01:40:35.560 --> 01:40:37.560
Could do everything by...

01:40:41.560 --> 01:40:43.560
I take out the blood book, the blood book.

01:40:43.560 --> 01:40:45.560
My blood book of blood spells.

01:40:45.560 --> 01:40:47.560
Okay.

01:40:47.560 --> 01:40:49.560
It doesn't have blood in it.

01:40:49.560 --> 01:40:51.560
It's not a heart.

01:40:51.560 --> 01:40:53.560
That's why we don't...

01:40:53.560 --> 01:40:55.560
It doesn't have blood.

01:40:55.560 --> 01:40:57.560
I cut myself.

01:40:57.560 --> 01:40:59.560
You cut yourself.

01:40:59.560 --> 01:41:01.560
I pour blood

01:41:01.560 --> 01:41:03.560
onto where I'm standing.

01:41:03.560 --> 01:41:05.560
Is there a shelf near the...

01:41:05.560 --> 01:41:07.560
There's electronics. I keep thinking water.

01:41:07.560 --> 01:41:09.560
There's no electronics.

01:41:09.560 --> 01:41:11.560
It's a golem.

01:41:11.560 --> 01:41:13.560
I flip through the blood book

01:41:13.560 --> 01:41:15.560
and I'm just randomly...

01:41:15.560 --> 01:41:17.560
I'm hoping there's going to be a thing

01:41:17.560 --> 01:41:19.560
that'll turn my blood into something so big

01:41:19.560 --> 01:41:21.560
that it'll explode the golem from the inside.

01:41:21.560 --> 01:41:23.560
Sort of what I try to do with the building,

01:41:23.560 --> 01:41:25.560
but you shut me down.

01:41:25.560 --> 01:41:27.560
That's not going to work.

01:41:27.560 --> 01:41:29.560
Sharpie, look inside.

01:41:29.560 --> 01:41:31.560
Is there any sort of mechanism or any sort of sin use

01:41:31.560 --> 01:41:33.560
or things that look vital that we could...

01:41:33.560 --> 01:41:35.560
I examine my surroundings.

01:41:37.560 --> 01:41:39.560
There's been a long time since that's happened.

01:41:41.560 --> 01:41:43.560
You had to roll the dice?

01:41:43.560 --> 01:41:45.560
I examine my surroundings.

01:41:45.560 --> 01:41:47.560
It's a procession check, man.

01:41:47.560 --> 01:41:49.560
I examine all of them.

01:41:51.560 --> 01:41:53.560
You examine your surroundings.

01:41:53.560 --> 01:41:55.560
You see several glowing things.

01:41:55.560 --> 01:41:57.560
Three of them are green.

01:41:57.560 --> 01:41:59.560
Two of them are yellow.

01:41:59.560 --> 01:42:01.560
You also see two holes below you.

01:42:03.560 --> 01:42:05.560
What about those glowing things?

01:42:05.560 --> 01:42:07.560
That's got to be the key to something, right, guys?

01:42:07.560 --> 01:42:09.560
I'm interested in those two holes below.

01:42:09.560 --> 01:42:11.560
One of them was my daughter.

01:42:19.560 --> 01:42:21.560
So that's happening.

01:42:21.560 --> 01:42:23.560
Are the glowing things like glowing balls?

01:42:23.560 --> 01:42:25.560
Can I get up to them?

01:42:25.560 --> 01:42:27.560
You can't. You're outside.

01:42:27.560 --> 01:42:29.560
You're not in here.

01:42:29.560 --> 01:42:31.560
To the holes, I'm going down into the holes.

01:42:31.560 --> 01:42:33.560
Let's go in the holes.

01:42:33.560 --> 01:42:35.560
We're going to the holes.

01:42:35.560 --> 01:42:37.560
How big are the holes?

01:42:37.560 --> 01:42:39.560
Are they hand-sized like we can fit in them?

01:42:39.560 --> 01:42:41.560
Yeah.

01:42:41.560 --> 01:42:43.560
They've got to be the legs.

01:42:43.560 --> 01:42:45.560
You're just going into the feet.

01:42:47.560 --> 01:42:49.560
Nice.

01:42:49.560 --> 01:42:51.560
You say it like that.

01:42:51.560 --> 01:42:53.560
This is...

01:42:53.560 --> 01:42:55.560
Second ago, we were inviting people...

01:42:55.560 --> 01:42:57.560
No, you said there's two green, two yellow.

01:42:57.560 --> 01:42:59.560
Three green, two yellow.

01:42:59.560 --> 01:43:01.560
Three green, two yellow.

01:43:01.560 --> 01:43:03.560
Figure out the pattern there.

01:43:03.560 --> 01:43:05.560
Are there holes on the outside?

01:43:05.560 --> 01:43:07.560
Three green, two yellow.

01:43:07.560 --> 01:43:09.560
That's a mislead.

01:43:09.560 --> 01:43:11.560
Yeah, it's not anatomical.

01:43:11.560 --> 01:43:13.560
It's not like...

01:43:13.560 --> 01:43:15.560
Two legs that are the size of a dude.

01:43:15.560 --> 01:43:17.560
It says the heart guy.

01:43:19.560 --> 01:43:21.560
But they must go somewhere.

01:43:21.560 --> 01:43:23.560
I mean, I could explore.

01:43:23.560 --> 01:43:25.560
Avenger, you...

01:43:25.560 --> 01:43:27.560
I'll go down the other one.

01:43:27.560 --> 01:43:29.560
High five before we go.

01:43:29.560 --> 01:43:33.560
Avenger, I love your work.

01:43:33.560 --> 01:43:35.560
You guys jump down the holes.

01:43:35.560 --> 01:43:37.560
And what you see is really strange.

01:43:37.560 --> 01:43:39.560
You see a glowing stone...

01:43:39.560 --> 01:43:41.560
floating in midfoot.

01:43:41.560 --> 01:43:43.560
Are we both together again?

01:43:43.560 --> 01:43:45.560
No, that's got to be a power...

01:43:45.560 --> 01:43:47.560
We both see glowing stones.

01:43:47.560 --> 01:43:49.560
Yeah, so this has got to be the power source.

01:43:49.560 --> 01:43:51.560
Yeah.

01:43:51.560 --> 01:43:53.560
I feel like it should be someone else's turn

01:43:53.560 --> 01:43:55.560
unless we want to keep going.

01:43:55.560 --> 01:43:57.560
It's Chris's turn.

01:43:57.560 --> 01:43:59.560
Yeah, okay.

01:43:59.560 --> 01:44:01.560
Well, I'm outside of all this.

01:44:01.560 --> 01:44:03.560
I have no idea what's going on, right?

01:44:03.560 --> 01:44:05.560
Can I take my wire saw?

01:44:05.560 --> 01:44:07.560
Yeah.

01:44:07.560 --> 01:44:09.560
I'm in the feet.

01:44:09.560 --> 01:44:11.560
Easy with the saw.

01:44:11.560 --> 01:44:13.560
Can I get down to the feet

01:44:13.560 --> 01:44:15.560
from where I am?

01:44:15.560 --> 01:44:17.560
It would take you...

01:44:17.560 --> 01:44:19.560
A turn?

01:44:19.560 --> 01:44:21.560
What can I reach of the robot?

01:44:21.560 --> 01:44:23.560
You can get down to his shoulder, I think,

01:44:23.560 --> 01:44:25.560
or maybe his torso.

01:44:25.560 --> 01:44:29.560
Go and I dip the saw in the acid.

01:44:29.560 --> 01:44:31.560
I have five vials of acid.

01:44:31.560 --> 01:44:33.560
And I just pour all of them on there.

01:44:33.560 --> 01:44:35.560
On the wire saw.

01:44:35.560 --> 01:44:37.560
Hopefully they don't dissolve the saw itself.

01:44:37.560 --> 01:44:39.560
Yeah.

01:44:39.560 --> 01:44:41.560
And they don't.

01:44:41.560 --> 01:44:43.560
I feel like that's what happens.

01:44:43.560 --> 01:44:45.560
Okay, all right.

01:44:45.560 --> 01:44:47.560
Take back.

01:44:47.560 --> 01:44:49.560
He still has the handle.

01:44:49.560 --> 01:44:51.560
I have the handle.

01:44:51.560 --> 01:44:55.560
It's like a Merck's Brothers.

01:44:59.560 --> 01:45:01.560
Is the robot...

01:45:01.560 --> 01:45:03.560
Can I use any of the poisons?

01:45:03.560 --> 01:45:05.560
No, not a robot.

01:45:05.560 --> 01:45:07.560
I just go down there and I start sawing at the neck of the...

01:45:07.560 --> 01:45:09.560
Nice.

01:45:11.560 --> 01:45:13.560
I jump out of the way.

01:45:13.560 --> 01:45:15.560
Your blade bites deeply into the metal

01:45:15.560 --> 01:45:19.560
and you continue to saw vigorously.

01:45:19.560 --> 01:45:21.560
It'll take some time.

01:45:21.560 --> 01:45:23.560
It's sawing.

01:45:23.560 --> 01:45:25.560
Is it going to take longer than making a fucking building would have?

01:45:25.560 --> 01:45:27.560
No, not quite as long.

01:45:27.560 --> 01:45:29.560
Okay.

01:45:29.560 --> 01:45:31.560
Who's turn is it?

01:45:31.560 --> 01:45:33.560
Me.

01:45:33.560 --> 01:45:35.560
We'll go this way.

01:45:35.560 --> 01:45:37.560
Okay, great.

01:45:37.560 --> 01:45:39.560
Well,

01:45:39.560 --> 01:45:41.560
I am going to...

01:45:41.560 --> 01:45:43.560
Can I jump into his face

01:45:43.560 --> 01:45:45.560
down to where the glowing things are?

01:45:45.560 --> 01:45:47.560
Can I jump into his mouth?

01:45:47.560 --> 01:45:49.560
No, it doesn't really have a proper mouth.

01:45:49.560 --> 01:45:51.560
All right.

01:45:51.560 --> 01:45:53.560
I don't know why that's funny.

01:45:53.560 --> 01:45:55.560
Okay, all right.

01:45:55.560 --> 01:45:57.560
Well, then I'm going to...

01:45:57.560 --> 01:45:59.560
I'm going to help Chris saw.

01:45:59.560 --> 01:46:01.560
Will that speed it up?

01:46:01.560 --> 01:46:03.560
Yeah, definitely.

01:46:03.560 --> 01:46:05.560
Hey, I got you.

01:46:05.560 --> 01:46:07.560
Oh, cool.

01:46:07.560 --> 01:46:09.560
You know, I almost dissolved my own saw

01:46:09.560 --> 01:46:11.560
with these acids.

01:46:11.560 --> 01:46:13.560
What a maroon.

01:46:13.560 --> 01:46:15.560
Now, does the column have a head

01:46:15.560 --> 01:46:17.560
to a robot thing?

01:46:17.560 --> 01:46:19.560
Yeah, definitely.

01:46:19.560 --> 01:46:21.560
I go on to the other side

01:46:21.560 --> 01:46:23.560
and do a flaming sword

01:46:23.560 --> 01:46:25.560
power attack and try to chop his head from the other side.

01:46:25.560 --> 01:46:27.560
All right.

01:46:27.560 --> 01:46:29.560
Oh, fuck.

01:46:29.560 --> 01:46:31.560
Oh.

01:46:31.560 --> 01:46:33.560
You critically hit.

01:46:33.560 --> 01:46:35.560
Whoa!

01:46:35.560 --> 01:46:37.560
Wow.

01:46:37.560 --> 01:46:39.560
Ooh.

01:46:39.560 --> 01:46:41.560
It deals 26 damage.

01:46:41.560 --> 01:46:43.560
Oh!

01:46:43.560 --> 01:46:45.560
You guys are wailing on it

01:46:45.560 --> 01:46:47.560
from both sides.

01:46:47.560 --> 01:46:49.560
It's got maybe a third of its neck left

01:46:49.560 --> 01:46:51.560
at this point.

01:46:51.560 --> 01:46:53.560
Yeah.

01:46:53.560 --> 01:46:55.560
Mitch, you having a good time?

01:46:55.560 --> 01:46:57.560
Yeah, I feel like...

01:46:57.560 --> 01:46:59.560
I'm glad the sawing is stopping

01:46:59.560 --> 01:47:01.560
because that's been annoying.

01:47:01.560 --> 01:47:03.560
That sound.

01:47:03.560 --> 01:47:05.560
We're almost done

01:47:05.560 --> 01:47:07.560
with the sawing.

01:47:07.560 --> 01:47:09.560
You guys go.

01:47:09.560 --> 01:47:11.560
All right, so I got a gem in front of me.

01:47:11.560 --> 01:47:13.560
I combined the gems.

01:47:13.560 --> 01:47:15.560
I mean, obviously,

01:47:15.560 --> 01:47:17.560
I'm the interloper here.

01:47:17.560 --> 01:47:19.560
I don't think we're in the same place.

01:47:19.560 --> 01:47:21.560
But you got a gem, I got a gem.

01:47:21.560 --> 01:47:23.560
We both went down two different holes.

01:47:23.560 --> 01:47:25.560
And we're in two different gems.

01:47:25.560 --> 01:47:27.560
Can I cast shrink item on again?

01:47:27.560 --> 01:47:29.560
Uh, yes.

01:47:31.560 --> 01:47:33.560
You're just making the thing that...

01:47:33.560 --> 01:47:35.560
Oh, on the jewel.

01:47:35.560 --> 01:47:37.560
Hey, man, however many hearts this thing has.

01:47:37.560 --> 01:47:39.560
I opened my mouth.

01:47:39.560 --> 01:47:41.560
I opened my mouth

01:47:41.560 --> 01:47:43.560
and I don't say anything.

01:47:43.560 --> 01:47:45.560
And I just nod.

01:47:45.560 --> 01:47:47.560
Minimus?

01:47:47.560 --> 01:47:49.560
Itemus?

01:47:49.560 --> 01:47:51.560
That's a different magical phrase

01:47:51.560 --> 01:47:53.560
than the last time.

01:47:53.560 --> 01:47:55.560
I'm, like, uh,

01:47:55.560 --> 01:47:57.560
Lou Diamond Phillips in La Bamba.

01:47:57.560 --> 01:47:59.560
I don't sing it the same way.

01:47:59.560 --> 01:48:01.560
It's not part of my people.

01:48:01.560 --> 01:48:03.560
Oh, then it works.

01:48:03.560 --> 01:48:05.560
That...

01:48:05.560 --> 01:48:07.560
Easy gem.

01:48:07.560 --> 01:48:09.560
According to Jim, this show is almost over.

01:48:09.560 --> 01:48:11.560
Okay, you cast it

01:48:11.560 --> 01:48:13.560
on this gem and

01:48:13.560 --> 01:48:15.560
it seems to not shrink.

01:48:15.560 --> 01:48:17.560
But then it does.

01:48:17.560 --> 01:48:19.560
Yeah!

01:48:19.560 --> 01:48:21.560
That's good storytelling.

01:48:21.560 --> 01:48:23.560
That's good.

01:48:23.560 --> 01:48:25.560
Because for a second, it seemed like it wasn't going to shrink.

01:48:25.560 --> 01:48:27.560
No.

01:48:27.560 --> 01:48:29.560
And then, and I was like, oh, god,

01:48:29.560 --> 01:48:31.560
and then it shrunk. That's what I was going for.

01:48:31.560 --> 01:48:33.560
That is what you were going for.

01:48:33.560 --> 01:48:35.560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:48:35.560 --> 01:48:37.560
And I can't see, so I go,

01:48:37.560 --> 01:48:39.560
guys, did it shrink right away?

01:48:39.560 --> 01:48:41.560
Or was there a moment?

01:48:41.560 --> 01:48:43.560
No, I did the exact same thing.

01:48:43.560 --> 01:48:45.560
I thought it wasn't going to shrink.

01:48:45.560 --> 01:48:47.560
It must have been terrifying for that split second.

01:48:47.560 --> 01:48:49.560
Yeah, right at the start,

01:48:49.560 --> 01:48:51.560
when it seemed like it wasn't going to shrink.

01:48:51.560 --> 01:48:53.560
Cut the chatter, Red 2.

01:48:55.560 --> 01:48:57.560
Yeah.

01:48:57.560 --> 01:48:59.560
So as you shrink the power gem,

01:48:59.560 --> 01:49:01.560
you notice the ambient lights

01:49:01.560 --> 01:49:03.560
of all the glowing things above your head

01:49:03.560 --> 01:49:05.560
start to dim and

01:49:05.560 --> 01:49:07.560
go dim.

01:49:07.560 --> 01:49:09.560
So that was the

01:49:09.560 --> 01:49:11.560
late dimmer.

01:49:11.560 --> 01:49:13.560
Great work by our lighting expert.

01:49:13.560 --> 01:49:15.560
Literally, I saw

01:49:15.560 --> 01:49:17.560
walk away.

01:49:17.560 --> 01:49:19.560
Yeah.

01:49:19.560 --> 01:49:21.560
Avenger!

01:49:21.560 --> 01:49:23.560
Go right over to the guitar center.

01:49:23.560 --> 01:49:25.560
Shrink your gem!

01:49:25.560 --> 01:49:27.560
Sorry.

01:49:27.560 --> 01:49:29.560
Shrink your gem!

01:49:29.560 --> 01:49:31.560
I'm being ironic.

01:49:31.560 --> 01:49:33.560
You know, I'm in a foot

01:49:33.560 --> 01:49:35.560
and I really can't.

01:49:35.560 --> 01:49:37.560
You made that assumption from the moment

01:49:37.560 --> 01:49:39.560
we went down those two black holes.

01:49:39.560 --> 01:49:41.560
I really can't hear you.

01:49:41.560 --> 01:49:43.560
I think you can.

01:49:43.560 --> 01:49:45.560
We're like Beastmaster and Beastmaster D.

01:49:45.560 --> 01:49:47.560
Thanks.

01:49:47.560 --> 01:49:49.560
I'm a huge fan of your work, too.

01:49:49.560 --> 01:49:51.560
Huge fan of your work, too.

01:49:51.560 --> 01:49:53.560
Thank you, thank you.

01:49:53.560 --> 01:49:55.560
Inspired by it.

01:49:55.560 --> 01:49:57.560
That's not possible, but thank you.

01:49:57.560 --> 01:49:59.560
Maybe we should slow down

01:49:59.560 --> 01:50:01.560
the time in there.

01:50:01.560 --> 01:50:03.560
Yeah.

01:50:03.560 --> 01:50:05.560
We stop sawing.

01:50:05.560 --> 01:50:07.560
We're just going to give them a little more time.

01:50:07.560 --> 01:50:09.560
No, don't stop sawing!

01:50:09.560 --> 01:50:11.560
Yeah, don't stop on our account.

01:50:11.560 --> 01:50:13.560
We just don't want to invade your intimacy.

01:50:13.560 --> 01:50:15.560
Keep sawing, you guys.

01:50:15.560 --> 01:50:17.560
What happened to Shrunk? That was a good thing, right?

01:50:17.560 --> 01:50:19.560
Yeah, yeah.

01:50:19.560 --> 01:50:21.560
Guys, the show's over in a minute.

01:50:21.560 --> 01:50:23.560
Okay.

01:50:23.560 --> 01:50:25.560
Is there any way you can get to the other foot

01:50:25.560 --> 01:50:27.560
quickly and also shrink it?

01:50:27.560 --> 01:50:29.560
Sorry, everybody.

01:50:29.560 --> 01:50:31.560
Can I put my armor

01:50:31.560 --> 01:50:33.560
on the saw to make it go faster

01:50:33.560 --> 01:50:35.560
to heat up the metal? It kills my saw again.

01:50:35.560 --> 01:50:37.560
Yeah, it would.

01:50:37.560 --> 01:50:39.560
This saw.

01:50:39.560 --> 01:50:41.560
Is it possible?

01:50:41.560 --> 01:50:43.560
This is putting a lot of onus on the bonus here,

01:50:43.560 --> 01:50:45.560
but is it possible

01:50:45.560 --> 01:50:47.560
because we're wrapping the show up here,

01:50:47.560 --> 01:50:49.560
we've got to get out of here.

01:50:49.560 --> 01:50:51.560
Maybe Avenger and Sharpie

01:50:51.560 --> 01:50:53.560
have a moment here

01:50:53.560 --> 01:50:55.560
to have some sort of cliffhanger.

01:50:55.560 --> 01:50:57.560
You guys are both...

01:50:57.560 --> 01:50:59.560
I feel like what we need to do is pull back

01:50:59.560 --> 01:51:01.560
from the whole combat scene

01:51:01.560 --> 01:51:03.560
to a kind of Rod Serling-like genie

01:51:03.560 --> 01:51:05.560
voiced by Robin Williams.

01:51:05.560 --> 01:51:07.560
All right.

01:51:07.560 --> 01:51:09.560
Just sort of...

01:51:09.560 --> 01:51:11.560
Oh, they're in trouble now.

01:51:11.560 --> 01:51:13.560
That's our show, everybody.

01:51:13.560 --> 01:51:15.560
Thank you so much.

01:51:15.560 --> 01:51:17.560
That's our show, everybody.

01:51:17.560 --> 01:51:19.560
Thank you so much.

01:51:19.560 --> 01:51:21.560
We fucking did it.

01:51:21.560 --> 01:51:23.560
Thank you so much, everybody, for coming.

01:51:23.560 --> 01:51:25.560
One more time, Erin McGathy.

01:51:25.560 --> 01:51:27.560
Yeah!

01:51:27.560 --> 01:51:29.560
Spencer Crittenden.

01:51:29.560 --> 01:51:31.560
Kumail Nanjiani.

01:51:31.560 --> 01:51:33.560
Mitch Herwitz.

01:51:33.560 --> 01:51:35.560
Yeah!

01:51:35.560 --> 01:51:37.560
I'm Jeff Davis.

01:51:37.560 --> 01:51:39.560
One more time for your mayor, Dan Hartman.

01:51:39.560 --> 01:51:41.560
Yeah!

01:51:41.560 --> 01:51:43.560
Thank you all. Have a good night.

01:51:45.560 --> 01:51:47.560
If you're trying to make yourself laugh,

01:51:47.560 --> 01:51:49.560
we happen to have chosen a field

01:51:49.560 --> 01:51:51.560
that neither of us are really right for

01:51:51.560 --> 01:51:53.560
because television is all about repetition.

01:51:53.560 --> 01:51:55.560
That's what it does best.

01:51:55.560 --> 01:51:57.560
Maybe up until the current era.

01:52:01.560 --> 01:52:03.560
I think I know how to help them.

01:52:05.560 --> 01:52:07.560
I'll cast a bit of Mirai and Murphy witchcraft.

01:52:07.560 --> 01:52:09.560
Oh, it's Ryan Murphy.

01:52:09.560 --> 01:52:11.560
Ryan Murphy.

01:52:11.560 --> 01:52:13.560
You just need some voodoo magic

01:52:13.560 --> 01:52:15.560
for the violin.

01:52:15.560 --> 01:52:17.560
Come on.

01:52:17.560 --> 01:52:19.560
Do something really sexy.

01:52:19.560 --> 01:52:21.560
Take your fucking shirt off.

01:52:21.560 --> 01:52:23.560
Take your shirt off.

01:52:23.560 --> 01:52:25.560
Come on, hot shot.

01:52:25.560 --> 01:52:27.560
You're a public figure. It's not harassment.

01:52:27.560 --> 01:52:29.560
I'm being bullied by Mitch Herwitz.

01:52:29.560 --> 01:52:31.560
It's not bullying

01:52:31.560 --> 01:52:33.560
if you're voted sexy.

01:52:37.560 --> 01:52:39.560
Oh, you are.

01:52:39.560 --> 01:52:41.560
You're a public figure now.

01:52:45.560 --> 01:52:47.560
Jesus Christ!

01:52:47.560 --> 01:52:49.560
Holy cow.

01:52:49.560 --> 01:52:51.560
Look at those tips.

01:52:51.560 --> 01:52:53.560
Oh, my God. His pecs look so good.

01:52:53.560 --> 01:52:55.560
Mitch, you thinking what I'm thinking?

01:52:55.560 --> 01:53:11.560
Oh, my God.
