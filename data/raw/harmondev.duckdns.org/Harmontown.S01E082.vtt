{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:17.960\nHello from Meltdown Comics, from NerdMelt Media in Hollywood, California, Harmontown\n\n00:17.960 --> 00:18.960\nis now in session.\n\n00:18.960 --> 00:34.360\nWelcome to the stage of the Mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.\n\n00:34.360 --> 00:35.360\nHappy Thanksgiving!\n\n00:35.360 --> 00:38.880\nThank you for making the drive and the treacherous traffic.\n\n00:38.880 --> 00:41.480\nGood for you, good for you folks.\n\n00:41.480 --> 00:45.600\nSo there was some kind of parade or something in LA, right?\n\n00:45.600 --> 00:46.600\nWas it the Christmas parade?\n\n00:46.600 --> 00:47.600\nYes, yeah.\n\n00:47.600 --> 00:48.600\nReally?\n\n00:48.600 --> 00:49.600\nThat's a big parade.\n\n00:49.600 --> 00:50.600\nIt's a bummer, though.\n\n00:50.600 --> 00:51.600\nHave you been to it?\n\n00:51.600 --> 00:52.600\nNo, no.\n\n00:52.600 --> 00:53.600\nIt's not a good parade.\n\n00:53.600 --> 00:54.600\nI assume it's a...\n\n00:54.600 --> 00:56.600\nNo parade is a good parade.\n\n00:56.600 --> 00:57.600\nNot anyway.\n\n00:57.600 --> 01:02.600\nI saw the Macy's Day one on TV.\n\n01:02.600 --> 01:07.600\nRonald McDonald was just scraping his belly along the...\n\n01:07.600 --> 01:08.600\nBroadway.\n\n01:08.600 --> 01:12.800\nI don't know if there was a golden age of the Macy's Day parade when it was like, oh,\n\n01:12.800 --> 01:15.600\neach float is a cultural masterpiece or something.\n\n01:15.600 --> 01:20.000\nIt just happens in Hong Kong Fooies in there, too, but I think it was probably always a\n\n01:20.000 --> 01:23.000\ncommercial jerk-off.\n\n01:23.000 --> 01:28.600\nIt was probably all pretty capitalistic in nature, but boy, howdy.\n\n01:28.600 --> 01:32.880\nWith the floats and then they just stop and this was weird, silent boulevard and some\n\n01:32.880 --> 01:38.240\nkid in a snow jacket does a break dance and they just, the announcers are just going like,\n\n01:38.240 --> 01:42.960\nthere's the buttermilk cracker float, buttermilk crackers that Santa's workshop, the crackers\n\n01:42.960 --> 01:48.520\ngo down the chimney and out to all the boys and girls and there's Alonzo Mosley.\n\n01:48.520 --> 01:52.520\nThe star of...\n\n01:52.520 --> 01:59.080\nThe character from Midnight Run that the outfit Kodo played.\n\n01:59.080 --> 02:02.320\nIn point of fact is who I just named.\n\n02:02.320 --> 02:04.000\nThat's where my brain...\n\n02:04.000 --> 02:05.960\nWere he in Hong Kong Fooie in the same parade?\n\n02:05.960 --> 02:09.600\nDo you want to tell people who Hong Kong Fooie is in case they don't know?\n\n02:09.600 --> 02:10.600\nHey, what's up?\n\n02:10.600 --> 02:12.040\nLook, I didn't even know who the hell he was.\n\n02:12.040 --> 02:15.880\nI only ever knew who Hong Kong Fooie was from the Macy's parade.\n\n02:15.880 --> 02:16.880\nIt would be the...\n\n02:16.880 --> 02:19.960\nIt was that hold-on float.\n\n02:19.960 --> 02:23.440\nI don't know if there was still a Hong Kong Fooie, but there was a Pokemon and there was\n\n02:23.440 --> 02:27.440\na Pikachu and there was a...\n\n02:27.440 --> 02:28.440\nThe last thing I was...\n\n02:28.440 --> 02:32.400\nBecause it was playing in the hotel in Florida and the last thing on the feed in Florida\n\n02:32.400 --> 02:34.160\nwas Santa Claus.\n\n02:34.160 --> 02:35.160\nI guess that's how they end.\n\n02:35.160 --> 02:41.400\nThe guy goes, and as always, the end of all the Thanksgiving parades, there's Santa Claus.\n\n02:41.400 --> 02:47.480\nBoy, it's great to see him, and as all the kids get on top of the parents, straining\n\n02:47.480 --> 02:48.480\ncommercial.\n\n02:48.480 --> 02:51.480\nThat was really funny.\n\n02:51.480 --> 02:57.880\nLook, there's a kid that you just left with the image of kids on top of parents straining.\n\n02:57.880 --> 03:00.360\nAnyways, whatever it was.\n\n03:00.360 --> 03:02.200\nBut normally it's the other way around.\n\n03:02.200 --> 03:06.200\nYeah, usually the parents strain on top of the kids.\n\n03:06.200 --> 03:07.200\nYeah.\n\n03:07.200 --> 03:10.200\nIt was funny.\n\n03:10.200 --> 03:15.200\nIn Purve Land.\n\n03:15.200 --> 03:16.200\nYeah.\n\n03:16.200 --> 03:23.400\nIs that Lorraine Newman's husband?\n\n03:23.400 --> 03:32.080\nHe's like a weird version of Commander Pike from Star Trek.\n\n03:32.080 --> 03:34.280\nHe's got only a couple buttons on his...\n\n03:34.280 --> 03:36.280\nAll right.\n\n03:36.280 --> 03:42.840\nI see the writing on the wall, I'm not the most facile tonight.\n\n03:42.840 --> 03:44.880\nThat's why we should bring up our amazing friends.\n\n03:44.880 --> 03:45.880\nWhat?\n\n03:45.880 --> 03:47.960\nI'm under the weather right now, so I'm in another world.\n\n03:47.960 --> 03:53.160\nLet's put the onus on the bonus.\n\n03:53.160 --> 03:55.600\nLet's show biz talk for...\n\n03:55.600 --> 03:58.280\nLet's hinge the show on our special guests.\n\n03:58.280 --> 04:01.160\nLet's put the onus on the bonus.\n\n04:01.160 --> 04:05.680\nIt's an old show biz term.\n\n04:05.680 --> 04:08.040\nLet's put the onus on the bonus.\n\n04:08.040 --> 04:09.800\nDon't tell me you've never heard that phrase.\n\n04:09.800 --> 04:12.720\nWell, I know what the onus is.\n\n04:12.720 --> 04:15.880\nIt's on the bonus, but they don't know who the bonus is.\n\n04:15.880 --> 04:20.880\nWell, I tweeted what the bonus was, and he did make it.\n\n04:20.880 --> 04:28.800\nPlease welcome my impish, quixotic, energetic, incredible, genius, intimidating, delightful\n\n04:28.800 --> 04:35.800\nfriend, Mitch Hurwitz, to the stage.\n\n04:35.800 --> 04:48.600\nHave any seat you like, do whatever you like, with them.\n\n04:48.600 --> 04:49.600\nOkay, go ahead.\n\n04:49.600 --> 04:50.600\nSit off there.\n\n04:50.600 --> 04:51.600\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n04:51.600 --> 04:52.600\nYeah.\n\n04:52.600 --> 04:53.600\nMitch Hurwitz.\n\n04:53.600 --> 04:54.600\nAll right.\n\n04:54.600 --> 04:58.080\nThere's a mic in there.\n\n04:58.080 --> 05:02.840\nThat was the thing that your anus was on.\n\n05:02.840 --> 05:03.840\nSo, yeah.\n\n05:03.840 --> 05:04.840\nDan.\n\n05:04.840 --> 05:10.800\nFirst of all, I can tell you, you have never seen an artist prepare the way Dan does backstage.\n\n05:10.800 --> 05:12.800\nCan I lift the veil a little bit?\n\n05:12.800 --> 05:13.800\nSure, sure, sure.\n\n05:13.800 --> 05:18.360\nIt gets here at like four in the afternoon, and it's calisthenics, and then newspaper\n\n05:18.360 --> 05:19.360\nafter newspaper.\n\n05:19.360 --> 05:22.880\nIt's unbelievable to see your process.\n\n05:22.880 --> 05:26.160\nYeah, I look for funny ads.\n\n05:26.160 --> 05:27.160\nAnd then the grooming.\n\n05:27.160 --> 05:32.320\nI mean, the grooming, which I'd heard about, you had only heard about.\n\n05:32.320 --> 05:33.320\nI'm so, I truly am.\n\n05:33.320 --> 05:35.480\nDan wakes up, actually, he doesn't wake up.\n\n05:35.480 --> 05:38.760\nHe wakes up at 6 a.m., as you know, and gets straight to work and starts writing community\n\n05:38.760 --> 05:40.640\nby 7 at Paramount.\n\n05:40.640 --> 05:41.640\nRight, yeah.\n\n05:41.640 --> 05:44.600\nBut at 4.30, while he's still asleep, a team of Korean women come in and groom him in\n\n05:44.600 --> 05:45.600\nhis sleep.\n\n05:45.600 --> 05:49.840\nThat's why every year is always, and punch up.\n\n05:49.840 --> 05:50.840\nYep.\n\n05:50.840 --> 05:56.080\nNo, but I really admire, I make this joke as a statement of admiration, because your\n\n05:56.080 --> 05:57.960\nprocess is so effortless.\n\n05:57.960 --> 06:01.280\nIt just comes out, honestly, my process is really tortured.\n\n06:01.280 --> 06:03.280\nLike, do you want to see me try to think of a joke?\n\n06:03.280 --> 06:04.280\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n06:04.280 --> 06:06.000\nTell me one about a caterpillar.\n\n06:06.000 --> 06:07.000\nOh, okay.\n\n06:07.000 --> 06:10.000\nSee what I mean?\n\n06:10.000 --> 06:14.560\nIt's just not, it's not like you're, it's too much.\n\n06:14.560 --> 06:15.560\nDan, show me your process.\n\n06:15.560 --> 06:16.560\nIt doesn't podcast.\n\n06:16.560 --> 06:17.560\nHey, guy walks in a bar, rape!\n\n06:17.560 --> 06:18.560\nSee, I don't, yeah.\n\n06:18.560 --> 06:30.120\nIt's, I'm sure it was everybody, what, thanks for coming Mitch, so whatever comes out of\n\n06:30.120 --> 06:31.120\nmy mouth.\n\n06:31.120 --> 06:34.120\nYour band is amazing too, they're so cute.\n\n06:34.120 --> 06:37.920\nUh, the band is good.\n\n06:37.920 --> 06:43.640\nUm, so, so I went, speaking of work ethic, uh, I wanted to ask you about your days at\n\n06:43.640 --> 06:48.400\nFox working on Arrested Development, world's smartest company.\n\n06:48.400 --> 06:51.840\nWould you like there to be no more Arrested Development, we could just speak candidly?\n\n06:51.840 --> 06:54.360\nUh, no, I wouldn't like there to be, yeah.\n\n06:54.360 --> 06:57.320\nBecause that might be the result of me speaking candidly.\n\n06:57.320 --> 06:58.320\nNo, no, no.\n\n06:58.320 --> 07:00.560\nI think our situations were pretty similar.\n\n07:00.560 --> 07:01.560\nI do.\n\n07:01.560 --> 07:08.320\nI think I, I created a more of a, you know, a sort of a polished social exterior than\n\n07:08.320 --> 07:14.440\nyou did, but I feel like, but I didn't have to work with Chevy Chase.\n\n07:14.440 --> 07:15.440\nRight.\n\n07:15.440 --> 07:21.280\nBut you did have to work, I've heard, I've heard backstage gossips and murmurs.\n\n07:21.280 --> 07:28.000\nYour family was no easy, uh, they weren't like a, like communities blessed with a bunch\n\n07:28.000 --> 07:29.000\nof people.\n\n07:29.000 --> 07:30.000\nExcept for Joel.\n\n07:30.000 --> 07:31.000\nI know they're amazing.\n\n07:31.000 --> 07:32.000\nYeah.\n\n07:32.000 --> 07:34.480\nJoel is a bit of a bitter pill to have to swallow.\n\n07:34.480 --> 07:36.960\nAnd there's a girl named Gillian, did you know that?\n\n07:36.960 --> 07:37.960\nYeah.\n\n07:37.960 --> 07:43.080\nShe's, she's, she's, she will throw a tantrum if you pronounce the G wrong and she throws\n\n07:43.080 --> 07:47.200\nhardcover books around that she, that she, she only bought cause you heard about him\n\n07:47.200 --> 07:52.480\non NPR and she, she got him cause of the hardness of the cover cause she wants to throw him\n\n07:52.480 --> 07:53.480\nat people.\n\n07:53.480 --> 07:58.200\nAnd if that is, uh, let's just say drinking and let's just say gambling and let's just\n\n07:58.200 --> 08:04.360\nsay violence and let's, I got to spend a few days over there and, uh, they really were\n\n08:04.360 --> 08:05.360\namazing.\n\n08:05.360 --> 08:06.360\nYeah.\n\n08:06.360 --> 08:07.360\nAnd they lionize you.\n\n08:07.360 --> 08:08.360\nYeah.\n\n08:08.360 --> 08:09.360\nWhat is that?\n\n08:09.360 --> 08:19.640\nWhen you compare someone to a lion, uh, whatever that is they do to you, I love you like, oh,\n\n08:19.640 --> 08:20.640\nhere comes Dan.\n\n08:20.640 --> 08:21.640\nHe could smell their red meat.\n\n08:21.640 --> 08:22.640\nHe kissed the lion.\n\n08:22.640 --> 08:23.640\nLike, oh, they're lionized.\n\n08:23.640 --> 08:27.600\nI'm absolutely positive that it's no exaggeration that you spent more time with them than I\n\n08:27.600 --> 08:30.200\ndid the whole 13 episodes because I doubt it.\n\n08:30.200 --> 08:34.800\nI hope that they understand that, that I, that that means that, that what I do, that\n\n08:34.800 --> 08:40.240\nthe footsteps aren't there cause I was, uh, masturbating in the bushes.\n\n08:40.240 --> 08:41.240\nYeah.\n\n08:41.240 --> 08:44.880\nI mean, I think they know, uh, but I don't know.\n\n08:44.880 --> 08:47.920\nThey, they really, they all admire you and I do think it's because they haven't spent\n\n08:47.920 --> 08:50.920\nmuch time with you.\n\n08:50.920 --> 08:53.800\nNo, they really, they're all so proud.\n\n08:53.800 --> 08:57.360\nThey're incredibly proud as they should be to be on such a great creative show.\n\n08:57.360 --> 09:00.480\nAnd the one that, that I got to sit in on was no exception.\n\n09:00.480 --> 09:01.480\nIt's so out there.\n\n09:01.480 --> 09:02.480\nIt's so creative.\n\n09:02.480 --> 09:03.480\nIt's unbelievable.\n\n09:03.480 --> 09:07.800\nI went to the set and I really, there was like a big chasm between like, you could tell\n\n09:07.800 --> 09:11.240\nthey thought, oh, this is like a show creator guy, a guy can give us jobs and everything.\n\n09:11.240 --> 09:14.480\nAnd by the end they really started to see me more as an equal.\n\n09:14.480 --> 09:16.160\nSo I got the hell out of there.\n\n09:16.160 --> 09:17.160\nYeah.\n\n09:17.160 --> 09:18.160\nThat's good.\n\n09:18.160 --> 09:19.160\nYou had the luxury.\n\n09:19.160 --> 09:20.160\nYeah.\n\n09:20.160 --> 09:21.160\nThat was a close one.\n\n09:21.160 --> 09:24.960\nAnd your, your, your bit was, uh, was, was amazing at everything that Schrab, Schrab cut\n\n09:24.960 --> 09:25.960\ntogether.\n\n09:25.960 --> 09:26.960\nIt's really fun.\n\n09:26.960 --> 09:29.240\nBut no, I have to say, actually like, like your cast, our cast was great.\n\n09:29.240 --> 09:30.240\nThey're wonderful.\n\n09:30.240 --> 09:31.240\nBut they hated each other.\n\n09:31.240 --> 09:32.240\nSome of them.\n\n09:32.240 --> 09:34.960\nAnd they just functioned truly as a family in a great way.\n\n09:34.960 --> 09:38.840\nYou know, we had like a couple of leading men as brothers and there was a lot of stuff\n\n09:38.840 --> 09:40.720\ngoing on there and they loved each other.\n\n09:40.720 --> 09:43.320\nThey were, and they, you know, competed.\n\n09:43.320 --> 09:46.880\nAnd, uh, but for me, the challenge, it was always, you know, Fox, it was always dealing\n\n09:46.880 --> 09:47.880\nwith the network.\n\n09:47.880 --> 09:48.960\nIt was all the same stuff you do.\n\n09:48.960 --> 09:53.880\nBut as far as what I found out this season, because, and I'm, I'm an honest person because\n\n09:53.880 --> 09:58.240\nthese people, once they fire you and bring you back, not because they respect you, but\n\n09:58.240 --> 10:02.760\nbecause if they brought you back, it's because they don't give a shit anymore.\n\n10:02.760 --> 10:06.560\nFor that reason, I have been left to my own devices and I have truly found that I was\n\n10:06.560 --> 10:07.560\nalways the problem.\n\n10:07.560 --> 10:13.040\nWell, in some of your devices, I've seen a couple of the devices.\n\n10:13.040 --> 10:14.040\nYeah.\n\n10:14.040 --> 10:16.560\nWell, left to my own actual self-build devices.\n\n10:16.560 --> 10:17.560\nYeah.\n\n10:17.560 --> 10:18.560\nIt's really offensive.\n\n10:18.560 --> 10:25.240\nI'm, I'm, I'm the Steve Jobs of, of, of Cronenbergian, uh, uh, acting in Blitz.\n\n10:25.240 --> 10:32.080\nYeah, yeah, I have a, I have a fake twin that, that, uh, that I invented a lot of weird,\n\n10:32.080 --> 10:37.880\ncurvy, uh, alien tailbone looking things that I, I claim helped you act.\n\n10:37.880 --> 10:41.720\nUm, there's a table full of them and they're all flecked with, uh, fluids.\n\n10:41.720 --> 10:45.480\nNo, but the amazing thing about this Sony, about your situation at Sony, because I know\n\n10:45.480 --> 10:48.680\nthey haven't been around this year.\n\n10:48.680 --> 10:51.080\nAnd I don't think it's because of that whale bone thing.\n\n10:51.080 --> 10:56.040\nI think it's, I, I think it's, it's that, I think they, I've always thought in television\n\n10:56.040 --> 10:59.240\nthey want you to push them out of it.\n\n10:59.240 --> 11:00.240\nReally?\n\n11:00.240 --> 11:01.240\nYeah.\n\n11:01.240 --> 11:04.520\nI mean, the whole says they want to be able to say, well, yeah, maybe that's it.\n\n11:04.520 --> 11:07.760\nThey don't want to be accountable, but also, you know, they know the only hits that have\n\n11:07.760 --> 11:11.520\never come for them are the ones where the guy said, fuck you, we're not doing it your\n\n11:11.520 --> 11:12.520\nway.\n\n11:12.520 --> 11:13.520\nBut that's, that's too selfless.\n\n11:13.520 --> 11:14.680\nI don't believe that they're that selfless.\n\n11:14.680 --> 11:17.840\nThat's why they're, they're still putting in their, their whole system where they've\n\n11:17.840 --> 11:20.880\ngot all these checks and balances and then it takes somebody to come along and say, you\n\n11:20.880 --> 11:22.840\nknow, on the Simpsons, they don't give notes.\n\n11:22.840 --> 11:23.840\nRight.\n\n11:23.840 --> 11:27.080\nBut those are all, those are all money-making things and they never left you alone until\n\n11:27.080 --> 11:32.360\nyou, you, you're, there, I mean, you and I were, we share, we're on the Simeon branch\n\n11:32.360 --> 11:34.520\nthat is the low-rated great ape.\n\n11:34.520 --> 11:35.520\nYeah.\n\n11:35.520 --> 11:36.520\nYeah.\n\n11:36.520 --> 11:39.520\nWe had no tail.\n\n11:39.520 --> 11:42.440\nIt's called the not, the non-wealthy ape.\n\n11:42.440 --> 11:45.480\nIt's the one branch of the ape that didn't become super wealthy.\n\n11:45.480 --> 11:50.520\nBut, but, but, but you, like the last temptation to Christ, the guys put up on the cross, what's\n\n11:50.520 --> 11:51.520\nhis name?\n\n11:51.520 --> 11:52.520\nUh, Christ.\n\n11:52.520 --> 12:05.800\nAnd, uh, he read for Michael Bluth, but everything was so on the nose, it was so overstated.\n\n12:05.800 --> 12:10.040\nFor a moment you get to see, like, like, like Christ is up there on the cross and you get,\n\n12:10.040 --> 12:13.920\nI think that's the conceit of that movie and book and whatever, is that for a moment you\n\n12:13.920 --> 12:18.440\nget to see, okay, it's all fine and well to know that the guy got put up there and forgive\n\n12:18.440 --> 12:21.320\nhim God, they don't know what they're doing and all that stuff.\n\n12:21.320 --> 12:25.240\nBut for a moment in that story, what you get to explore and see is, okay, what if he had\n\n12:25.240 --> 12:31.000\nsaid in a moment of, of passion, a moment of selfishness, all right, time out, forget\n\n12:31.000 --> 12:32.000\nit.\n\n12:32.000 --> 12:33.000\nI don't want to be Jesus ever again.\n\n12:33.000 --> 12:36.960\nUh, and you get to see that it would have sucked that, that, that, that in the long run\n\n12:36.960 --> 12:37.960\nit would have been shitty.\n\n12:37.960 --> 12:42.320\nI feel like, like, like politically, season five, they, they, like they said, okay, what\n\n12:42.320 --> 12:46.280\nif we did leave you alone, you preening, whining fucker?\n\n12:46.280 --> 12:50.880\nAnd the truth is we all, like, like, like I am my own worst enemy, like I will stay\n\n12:50.880 --> 12:56.040\nat that office until that, that the script is supposedly perfect, but it, it, it ain't\n\n12:56.040 --> 12:57.040\never perfect.\n\n12:57.040 --> 13:01.320\nLike Dan, you're saying that you're not getting any, like, uh, any trouble from the, uh, from\n\n13:01.320 --> 13:02.320\nthe Mucky Mucks?\n\n13:02.320 --> 13:04.800\nThey're not, they're not, they're not making my life difficult at all.\n\n13:04.800 --> 13:05.800\nNo.\n\n13:05.800 --> 13:06.800\nNo.\n\n13:06.800 --> 13:07.800\nYou lose something to rebel against.\n\n13:07.800 --> 13:09.160\nI mean, that is part of it.\n\n13:09.160 --> 13:12.540\nPart of it is you want to kind of stoke the, the fires of that anger a little bit.\n\n13:12.540 --> 13:15.840\nWe did a thing in the last season where we had a Google car, you know, that was going\n\n13:15.840 --> 13:20.000\nto be that, like the funny vehicle, cause I'm all for just anything else funny.\n\n13:20.000 --> 13:22.200\nYou can get in there, get it in there.\n\n13:22.200 --> 13:25.480\nSo, and every once we were in a parking lot, there were all these like air conditioning\n\n13:25.480 --> 13:31.080\ntrucks and Jim Valley said to me, look, season six, everybody's got a funny car.\n\n13:31.080 --> 13:35.520\nBut, uh, so we had Jason driving the Google car and it was just not that funny.\n\n13:35.520 --> 13:37.400\nAnd then we heard the Google wouldn't let us use it.\n\n13:37.400 --> 13:39.640\nWe were like, yes, we have a point of view now.\n\n13:39.640 --> 13:40.640\nRight.\n\n13:40.640 --> 13:41.640\nYou know, I get to be mad at something.\n\n13:41.640 --> 13:42.640\nYeah.\n\n13:42.640 --> 13:43.640\nWe're mad at it.\n\n13:43.640 --> 13:44.640\nAnd I think that's part of.\n\n13:44.640 --> 13:46.280\nThe oppositional defiant disorder.\n\n13:46.280 --> 13:47.280\nYes.\n\n13:47.280 --> 13:50.080\nIt's, it's, it's like, it's like someone's, someone's going to make me mad.\n\n13:50.080 --> 13:53.960\nWe brought, we brought, we brought, uh, some integrated marketing into as we've done to\n\n13:53.960 --> 13:56.960\ngreat success in the past and they're, they're really cool.\n\n13:56.960 --> 14:02.360\nAnd then they, and then they said that they, uh, well, we never, uh, we never call that\n\n14:02.360 --> 14:03.360\nthat.\n\n14:03.360 --> 14:04.360\nAnd I was like, yes.\n\n14:04.360 --> 14:05.360\nAnd I was like, now I know what the scene's about.\n\n14:05.360 --> 14:08.320\nWell, we are calling it a filet of fish sandwich now, my friend.\n\n14:08.320 --> 14:10.600\nOr now the scene's about how you don't call it that.\n\n14:10.600 --> 14:12.600\nNow how you like me.\n\n14:12.600 --> 14:17.620\nAnd I really, that really made me step back and go, is that your whole stick waiting around\n\n14:17.620 --> 14:19.120\nto be told what not to do?\n\n14:19.120 --> 14:21.400\nAnd then you talk about how you can't do it.\n\n14:21.400 --> 14:24.280\nLike, like, you know, there's always something to be outraged about, right?\n\n14:24.280 --> 14:29.720\nAnd I think like, I remember we did this, this ninth or the 10th episode of, of the third\n\n14:29.720 --> 14:30.720\nseason.\n\n14:30.720 --> 14:31.880\nIt was the first time we'd really gone super meta.\n\n14:31.880 --> 14:36.640\nWe'd done kind of things like that, but, um, we had no point of view in the show.\n\n14:36.640 --> 14:38.920\nIt was just something, nothing tied together.\n\n14:38.920 --> 14:42.080\nLike the kid was going to a private school and they were throwing a dinner.\n\n14:42.080 --> 14:44.000\nIt was just nothing.\n\n14:44.000 --> 14:46.000\nAnd then I got a call saying, you're canceled.\n\n14:46.000 --> 14:50.080\nIt was like, best thing that ever happened, a show nine.\n\n14:50.080 --> 14:52.920\nAnd that was the one that we were, they were making all these comments about, you know,\n\n14:52.920 --> 14:54.880\nnow there's going to be 3d segments and all that stuff.\n\n14:54.880 --> 14:55.880\nIt feels a little trite now.\n\n14:55.880 --> 14:56.880\nI did.\n\n14:56.880 --> 14:57.880\nI did.\n\n14:57.880 --> 15:03.440\nWe did an episode this year where I wrote it in anger, uh, in like six hours, uh, out\n\n15:03.440 --> 15:04.440\nof sarcasm.\n\n15:04.440 --> 15:05.560\nI know what that is.\n\n15:05.560 --> 15:11.800\nI read, I read something online that was somebody saying something and I was like, I know this\n\n15:11.800 --> 15:12.800\nis fucking.\n\n15:12.800 --> 15:13.800\nYou want to, you want to see this shit?\n\n15:13.800 --> 15:14.800\nFuck it.\n\n15:14.800 --> 15:15.800\nFuck it.\n\n15:15.800 --> 15:20.600\nAnd it's probably, it's really one of the better episodes of the season.\n\n15:20.600 --> 15:24.480\nIt's me going, yeah, everyone want to go home by six, fine, you're going home by six.\n\n15:24.480 --> 15:25.720\nSee how good the show is.\n\n15:25.720 --> 15:28.880\nAnd that's, it's fine.\n\n15:28.880 --> 15:29.880\nFine episode.\n\n15:29.880 --> 15:31.880\nA story, B story.\n\n15:31.880 --> 15:32.880\nI get it.\n\n15:32.880 --> 15:35.880\nA couple of jokes for Mitch.\n\n15:35.880 --> 15:40.080\nDan or Mitch, uh, I'll start with Dan, like what, what, what, what's been the recipe like\n\n15:40.080 --> 15:42.680\nclimate wise for the worst episode of the season?\n\n15:42.680 --> 15:51.840\nLike, uh, definitely without a doubt, it's, it's, it's knowing in advance what that you\n\n15:51.840 --> 15:59.160\nwant to do X. Now, uh, uh, you know, in the past that's some of the episodes are that,\n\n15:59.160 --> 16:05.360\nthat's always, that can generate your best episode knowing that you want to do, it's\n\n16:05.360 --> 16:14.000\ngoing to be a blank episode, um, but it without a doubt, when you are up at four AM on a Sunday,\n\n16:14.000 --> 16:17.160\nwhen the call time is seven AM Monday and you're writing the scene and no one knows\n\n16:17.160 --> 16:21.760\nwhat the fuck is going on, the reason for the trouble starts with someone saying, we\n\n16:21.760 --> 16:24.120\nhave to do a Dungeons and Dragons sequel.\n\n16:24.120 --> 16:26.360\nWe have to do a zombie Halloween.\n\n16:26.360 --> 16:31.600\nWe have to do Christmas is going to be this because it's not organic and it's, it's,\n\n16:31.600 --> 16:34.480\nyeah, well it's kind of like knowing what your theme is ahead of time.\n\n16:34.480 --> 16:35.480\nAnd you'll see people.\n\n16:35.480 --> 16:42.920\nYou'll see, you think Ryan Murphy listens to this show and he's like, oh, these are\n\n16:42.920 --> 16:43.920\nsome good pointers.\n\n16:43.920 --> 16:47.560\nI'm going to use that one for American Horror Story.\n\n16:47.560 --> 16:49.880\nI just picture him as having an Irish accent.\n\n16:49.880 --> 16:51.880\nI'm Ryan Murphy.\n\n16:51.880 --> 16:56.040\nI like to make the nice TV shows for the nice people.\n\n16:56.040 --> 17:00.040\nOh, I just, my experience of it seems like a very nice guy.\n\n17:00.040 --> 17:16.680\nI don't want to talk about him.\n\n17:16.680 --> 17:17.680\nHe shoots it.\n\n17:17.680 --> 17:22.040\nBut I would, I remember, he would say things when he was doing a nip talk and talk about\n\n17:22.040 --> 17:27.480\nhow, you know, I want to do a show about superficiality and about how people are as only as deep\n\n17:27.480 --> 17:28.480\nas their skin.\n\n17:28.480 --> 17:30.160\nI know you didn't.\n\n17:30.160 --> 17:36.000\nYou came up with that at some point, but it is whenever you start off.\n\n17:36.000 --> 17:37.840\nIt's always a lie what you're starting with.\n\n17:37.840 --> 17:40.520\nI mean, it's, it's what I was just praising you about, about this show.\n\n17:40.520 --> 17:45.760\nLike I see you figure out your point as you're making it, which I really admire because otherwise\n\n17:45.760 --> 17:46.760\nyou're kind of full of shit.\n\n17:46.760 --> 17:49.280\nYou're going in with an idea, what you want to say already.\n\n17:49.280 --> 17:50.280\nAnd I don't know.\n\n17:50.280 --> 17:55.000\nI remember pitching arrested and saying the concept was going to be it's about a family\n\n17:55.000 --> 17:59.120\nthat loses everything and is much happier because of it.\n\n17:59.120 --> 18:01.680\nAnd none of that happened.\n\n18:01.680 --> 18:04.640\nThey didn't, they didn't really lose that much.\n\n18:04.640 --> 18:13.880\nThey just sat around and stayed quasi rich, but very witty, the funniest family in the\n\n18:13.880 --> 18:14.880\nworld.\n\n18:14.880 --> 18:16.400\nYeah, they're really funny.\n\n18:16.400 --> 18:18.120\nThe material possession ever.\n\n18:18.120 --> 18:19.120\nYeah.\n\n18:19.120 --> 18:22.440\nAnd it really was the idea of like, you know, I said, oh, you know, the husband and wife\n\n18:22.440 --> 18:25.200\nthat haven't been sharing a bedroom, they're now going to have to share a bedroom and there's\n\n18:25.200 --> 18:26.600\nall these sort of family values.\n\n18:26.600 --> 18:30.160\nAnd then the first like three episodes that got thrown at my face a lot, aren't they supposed\n\n18:30.160 --> 18:31.160\nto learn that it's better?\n\n18:31.160 --> 18:32.160\nOh, yeah.\n\n18:32.160 --> 18:33.160\nNo, I'm building to it.\n\n18:33.160 --> 18:34.160\nThey're going to learn it's better.\n\n18:34.160 --> 18:35.160\nThey're going to learn it's much better.\n\n18:35.160 --> 18:42.560\nWe had to put our, our post super, but didn't you, didn't you work with Jay Gost?\n\n18:42.560 --> 18:43.560\nYeah.\n\n18:43.560 --> 18:44.560\nOn a one show.\n\n18:44.560 --> 18:48.520\nAnd not on a, doing the last couple episodes of season three, there was a point because\n\n18:48.520 --> 18:50.040\nit was like, well, how did season three end?\n\n18:50.040 --> 18:56.040\nChang was dressed as Napoleon and there was a dragon in the sky and Abbott's head was\n\n18:56.040 --> 18:57.040\nthe sun.\n\n18:57.040 --> 18:58.040\nI don't know.\n\n18:58.040 --> 19:00.040\nIt's just the college, the community college experience.\n\n19:00.040 --> 19:01.040\nYeah.\n\n19:01.040 --> 19:05.760\nI'm sound mixing it with Jay and I was like, Jay, could you think is there a way we can\n\n19:05.760 --> 19:10.040\nget, go to some kind of Japanese anime library and find some kind of something that sounds\n\n19:10.040 --> 19:13.840\nlike a light sword, but also can we mix it because it needs to be funny to it needs to\n\n19:13.840 --> 19:19.360\nbe an ironic take like an ersatz light sword sounds Japanese, but it needs to be like the\n\n19:19.360 --> 19:23.120\nAmericanized version because it's a Jeff's imagination and something, something like\n\n19:23.120 --> 19:24.120\nthat.\n\n19:24.120 --> 19:30.440\nAnd Jay Gost said, I signed on to a show about people going to a community college.\n\n19:30.440 --> 19:34.120\nHe was, he was being ironic of course.\n\n19:34.120 --> 19:36.360\nHe's a good sport, but yeah.\n\n19:36.360 --> 19:42.440\nBut, but, but I'm, I'm, I was curious like, like how, when you're, when you're surfing\n\n19:42.440 --> 19:46.320\nthe wave of, of, of, yes, have whatever you want.\n\n19:46.320 --> 19:47.320\nThere's water.\n\n19:47.320 --> 19:48.320\nThere's a home audience.\n\n19:48.320 --> 19:51.800\nThere's no idea at the array that's out here right now.\n\n19:51.800 --> 19:53.280\nThe beverage array.\n\n19:53.280 --> 19:55.440\nI'm in the Kettle One Alliance now.\n\n19:55.440 --> 20:01.160\nI don't know if you're, I don't know if I'm, now it's, and it's you guys against what,\n\n20:01.160 --> 20:04.040\nlike Captain Bacardi or whatever.\n\n20:04.040 --> 20:11.680\nThat's Ryan Murphy is, he's Jameson's, you better not take me Jameson's.\n\n20:11.680 --> 20:15.640\nI, I, I hear the alliance is in a bitter struggle, right?\n\n20:15.640 --> 20:19.160\nAgainst the, against Ryan Murphy's Bacardi Alliance or Jameson's whatever.\n\n20:19.160 --> 20:20.680\nHis Bacardi Empire.\n\n20:20.680 --> 20:21.680\nYeah.\n\n20:21.680 --> 20:25.920\nThere's a, there's a, all of the five major liquors are like the boroughs in,\n\n20:25.920 --> 20:28.960\nAnd POD is working its way into, which is going to throw off the alliance.\n\n20:28.960 --> 20:29.960\nYeah.\n\n20:29.960 --> 20:31.960\nLike you can't believe it's going to be like Japan.\n\n20:31.960 --> 20:32.960\nYeah.\n\n20:32.960 --> 20:33.960\nAnd what was that?\n\n20:33.960 --> 20:34.960\nWell that's Netflix, right?\n\n20:34.960 --> 20:35.960\nThe POD War.\n\n20:35.960 --> 20:38.960\nI don't know the wars in order.\n\n20:38.960 --> 20:41.000\nWhat was two?\n\n20:41.000 --> 20:44.480\nI saw the first one.\n\n20:44.480 --> 20:49.520\nUm, but I want to know how, how, when, when you were, when you were, when you were running\n\n20:49.520 --> 20:55.960\na network show, how, what, like, I appreciate you even trying to ask, because you already\n\n20:55.960 --> 20:56.960\nknow the answer.\n\n20:56.960 --> 21:00.480\nYou're trying to think of a way that we can get some information out to them, but you\n\n21:00.480 --> 21:01.480\nknow, it's the exact same experience.\n\n21:01.480 --> 21:06.080\nNo, I don't, I don't know, I don't know, like, like I want to know how dire it got in terms\n\n21:06.080 --> 21:11.840\nof like the, the, uh, distance between what was in your brain and what they were shooting\n\n21:11.840 --> 21:12.840\non set.\n\n21:12.840 --> 21:15.920\nI don't know chronologically, like how bad it got, because there's stories about David\n\n21:15.920 --> 21:20.960\nMilch literally, they would, this is drama and this is David Milch totally different\n\n21:20.960 --> 21:24.800\nthing, but there would be, there's stories about, there's a dude in his parking space\n\n21:24.800 --> 21:25.800\nwaiting.\n\n21:25.800 --> 21:26.800\nWow.\n\n21:26.800 --> 21:30.880\nHe pulls up into the parking space and like David Milch rolls out of the car onto his\n\n21:30.880 --> 21:37.520\nback and starts saying things into the air and the, and the, and the 20 year old collects\n\n21:37.520 --> 21:44.360\nit in a jar and throws it at, at, at the set, uh, and then they shoot that as it explodes\n\n21:44.360 --> 21:45.360\nout of the jar.\n\n21:45.360 --> 21:46.360\nLike, like, like.\n\n21:46.360 --> 21:47.680\nNo, it was not, it wasn't like that at all.\n\n21:47.680 --> 21:51.760\nIt was really, I mean, I, it got, was that Deadwood?\n\n21:51.760 --> 21:52.760\nWhat was that?\n\n21:52.760 --> 21:54.760\nIt was NYPD Blue.\n\n21:54.760 --> 21:55.760\nOkay.\n\n21:55.760 --> 21:56.760\nYeah.\n\n21:56.760 --> 21:57.760\nDo you remember that documentary?\n\n21:57.760 --> 21:58.760\nYou saw him on his back.\n\n21:58.760 --> 21:59.760\nYeah.\n\n21:59.760 --> 22:00.760\nThere was a shot of him on his back.\n\n22:00.760 --> 22:03.640\nNo, it was, yeah, a bad back, but he actually would, like he would show, he would, sometimes\n\n22:03.640 --> 22:08.280\nhe would, you know, they would, he would be laying on his back on set, calling out lines\n\n22:08.280 --> 22:10.240\nto the actors and they'd shoot him.\n\n22:10.240 --> 22:11.240\nThat's what I heard.\n\n22:11.240 --> 22:12.240\nThey shoot the actors.\n\n22:12.240 --> 22:13.240\nOh, I see.\n\n22:13.240 --> 22:14.240\nNo, that's not.\n\n22:14.240 --> 22:15.240\nLet's try it.\n\n22:15.240 --> 22:20.560\nMaybe it's, maybe it's great for creativity, but should we get down there and it wasn't\n\n22:20.560 --> 22:21.560\nlike that at all.\n\n22:21.560 --> 22:26.760\nIn fact, I, I see, I always had this illusion of myself as being reasonable.\n\n22:26.760 --> 22:31.480\nAnd then it got, I was accused once of, of, you know, it being rope-a-dope is what it\n\n22:31.480 --> 22:32.480\nwas called.\n\n22:32.480 --> 22:34.200\nBecause you said you were a nice guy.\n\n22:34.200 --> 22:39.200\nWell, I mean, I would try to, like I made it an effort not to be defensive.\n\n22:39.200 --> 22:42.760\nLike that's, which is very hard to do when you're hearing notes, because you just want\n\n22:42.760 --> 22:44.040\neverything out of your mouth.\n\n22:44.040 --> 22:46.120\nIf you've created anything, you want to say, no, you don't get it.\n\n22:46.120 --> 22:47.880\nThat's not what, I don't want to do it your way.\n\n22:47.880 --> 22:52.200\nBut if you can, I believe in like trying not to be offensive and trying to let in what\n\n22:52.200 --> 22:54.120\npeople are saying.\n\n22:54.120 --> 22:57.440\nAnd but then I wouldn't always act on it.\n\n22:57.440 --> 23:00.880\nYou know, I mean, I would try to take in like, okay, so what they're saying is they, they\n\n23:00.880 --> 23:04.120\ndon't see that this character cares for his son.\n\n23:04.120 --> 23:05.120\nAnd that's a drag.\n\n23:05.120 --> 23:09.200\nI want to up that, but I also don't want to sell it out and, you know, all those things.\n\n23:09.200 --> 23:15.640\nBut I, I worked so hard on addressing their notes that I, in a funny way, I don't think\n\n23:15.640 --> 23:19.080\nthey even saw that I was doing it because I would, you know, I could change the sentence\n\n23:19.080 --> 23:22.840\na little bit and I could put this scene earlier, but they didn't want that.\n\n23:22.840 --> 23:23.840\nThey wanted to see it.\n\n23:23.840 --> 23:24.840\nYou're not going to believe me.\n\n23:24.840 --> 23:28.320\nBut the exact, exactly the same way, because I, I came up doing improv.\n\n23:28.320 --> 23:33.640\nSo I would go, there's no difference between someone in a suit saying, could you put a\n\n23:33.640 --> 23:36.240\ndog in it or, or could Annie's care?\n\n23:36.240 --> 23:38.560\nI'm not tracking Annie's character in this scene.\n\n23:38.560 --> 23:41.760\nThere's no difference between that and bringing up someone from the audience and having them\n\n23:41.760 --> 23:43.200\ndo the sound effects.\n\n23:43.200 --> 23:44.720\nIt can be invigorating.\n\n23:44.720 --> 23:45.720\nRight.\n\n23:45.720 --> 23:48.200\nAnd, and there's a whole creativity that comes out of like, okay, you've got this house.\n\n23:48.200 --> 23:49.200\nIt's built.\n\n23:49.200 --> 23:50.200\nThis is the foundation.\n\n23:50.200 --> 23:51.200\nBut let's see if I move the stairs.\n\n23:51.200 --> 23:54.280\nAll I have to do is kind of bolster the stairs and still get to the second.\n\n23:54.280 --> 23:56.640\nAnd what they're thinking is, no, we thought you were going to bulldoze it.\n\n23:56.640 --> 23:57.640\nRight.\n\n23:57.640 --> 23:58.640\nAnd then they go like, well, I don't understand.\n\n23:58.640 --> 23:59.640\nYou're not following my notes.\n\n23:59.640 --> 24:01.960\nI was like, well, I'm following the note behind your note.\n\n24:01.960 --> 24:06.840\nI mean, you were, you were, you were saying that you wanted a flower on the guy's head.\n\n24:06.840 --> 24:10.800\nBut what you meant was you, you, there, there wasn't a prettiness to the scene.\n\n24:10.800 --> 24:15.400\nAnd so I did that with, by the guy punching the, the, the, the dog.\n\n24:15.400 --> 24:16.400\nRight.\n\n24:16.400 --> 24:17.400\nYeah.\n\n24:17.400 --> 24:18.400\nPunching the ugly dog.\n\n24:18.400 --> 24:19.400\nThe, the, because the ugly.\n\n24:19.400 --> 24:20.400\nGetting rid of one ugly animal.\n\n24:20.400 --> 24:22.400\nHe punished the ugly dog by punching it.\n\n24:22.400 --> 24:23.400\nAdd an ugly animal.\n\n24:23.400 --> 24:24.400\nRemove it.\n\n24:24.400 --> 24:25.400\nI don't know.\n\n24:25.400 --> 24:26.400\nI just.\n\n24:26.400 --> 24:28.400\nI don't want to cry.\n\n24:28.400 --> 24:32.240\nLike a little, like a relatively large volume of their, of their, of, of notes that are\n\n24:32.240 --> 24:33.240\ngiven to me.\n\n24:33.240 --> 24:36.240\nNo, I was always very surprised that they did not see that I was doing that.\n\n24:36.240 --> 24:38.000\nAnd then I would get really specific notes.\n\n24:38.000 --> 24:43.160\nThere was one point where somebody said to me, why are you doing this joke three times?\n\n24:43.160 --> 24:49.240\nAnd I, and I really was like, Oh God, am I doing that?\n\n24:49.240 --> 24:50.240\nOh God.\n\n24:50.240 --> 24:51.240\nLike, should it be five times?\n\n24:51.240 --> 24:52.240\nWow.\n\n24:52.240 --> 24:53.240\nNo.\n\n24:53.240 --> 24:56.600\nWhy is one a setup and one, why is the thing, and why is one a punchline?\n\n24:56.600 --> 24:58.400\nI remember, I remember the joke.\n\n24:58.400 --> 25:03.560\nIt was when it was Job talking about, it was just this little flight of fancy where someone\n\n25:03.560 --> 25:05.520\nsaid, Job said, did you see the new poof?\n\n25:05.520 --> 25:10.320\nWhich was a, what the magic magazine was called in a restaurant.\n\n25:10.320 --> 25:13.880\nAnd then Joe kind of misinterprets it, Gary, the new PA, is he, is he gay?\n\n25:13.880 --> 25:17.200\nOh God, I did something that could be taken the wrong way.\n\n25:17.200 --> 25:20.440\nAnd then we see really, I think it was four things that he did that could be taken the\n\n25:20.440 --> 25:24.960\nwrong way, the last of them, which is the one that this executive pointed out was him\n\n25:24.960 --> 25:30.760\nwith Gary on his lap on a chair rocking back and forth saying, well, it's not doing it\n\n25:30.760 --> 25:33.600\nnow.\n\n25:33.600 --> 25:38.240\nAnd both of them just looking and trying to feel what the chair is doing.\n\n25:38.240 --> 25:41.520\nWhy are you doing that so many times, why can't you just do it once?\n\n25:41.520 --> 25:46.960\nAnd it really was a, it was a fundamental understanding shift for me when I realized,\n\n25:46.960 --> 25:52.280\ndo you think I'm being an artist or being something that's going to cost you money?\n\n25:52.280 --> 25:56.760\nI'm trying to make this popular, but that was the fundamental misunderstanding.\n\n25:56.760 --> 25:59.080\nThis is my version of mainstream comedy.\n\n25:59.080 --> 26:03.800\nThere is no such thing, I hope there isn't, I would think that there would be a person\n\n26:03.800 --> 26:06.760\nthat you would, who's stuff you had never seen because they wouldn't get off the starting\n\n26:06.760 --> 26:07.760\nblock.\n\n26:07.760 --> 26:12.800\nThere's no such thing as a TV comedy writer, listen to those words, TV comedy.\n\n26:12.800 --> 26:13.800\nExactly.\n\n26:13.800 --> 26:18.040\nBut before you get to the word writer, you have long since made the decision to sell\n\n26:18.040 --> 26:19.040\nout.\n\n26:19.040 --> 26:22.000\nYou want people to like you.\n\n26:22.000 --> 26:25.360\nIt's like saying magician, masseuse.\n\n26:25.360 --> 26:27.360\nRecluse magician.\n\n26:27.360 --> 26:28.840\nRecluse of magician.\n\n26:28.840 --> 26:29.840\nWhat?\n\n26:29.840 --> 26:34.040\nLike you're not going to be one of those artsy fartsy magician masseuses, are you?\n\n26:34.040 --> 26:35.040\nYeah, we're nothing.\n\n26:35.040 --> 26:38.840\nThe guy who says, who needs someone to know that the corner disappeared and then rubs\n\n26:38.840 --> 26:39.840\nyour shoulders?\n\n26:39.840 --> 26:41.400\nNo, I'd want people to be happy.\n\n26:41.400 --> 26:44.120\nBut why does it have to be a French franc that disappears?\n\n26:44.120 --> 26:48.320\nWhy can't it be a half dollar, an American half dollar?\n\n26:48.320 --> 26:51.200\nI know you don't want to dumb it down.\n\n26:51.200 --> 26:56.760\nThey preemptively make you feel like a snob, but no, I am trying as hard as I can.\n\n26:56.760 --> 26:57.760\nThat's the sad fact.\n\n26:57.760 --> 26:59.320\nI'm trying as hard as I can.\n\n26:59.320 --> 27:03.760\nWell, you and I both made, I don't even know if it was a decision, but it was based on\n\n27:03.760 --> 27:07.440\nour personalities, let's do a show that we would like.\n\n27:07.440 --> 27:08.440\nI mean, there aren't people in any field.\n\n27:08.440 --> 27:09.440\nI learned it from you.\n\n27:09.440 --> 27:10.440\nI don't know what your excuse is.\n\n27:10.440 --> 27:16.280\nI swear to God, for watching Arrested Development, it was the moment when the Bluths for the\n\n27:16.280 --> 27:24.760\nthird time in the show made fun of someone for being cowardly and revealed that the family\n\n27:24.760 --> 27:27.880\nas a whole does not know what chickens sound like.\n\n27:27.880 --> 27:33.640\nAnd everyone's going, cool, cuddle, cuddle, cuddle, and Jason Bateman's going, has anyone\n\n27:33.640 --> 27:36.280\nin this family heard a chicken?\n\n27:36.280 --> 27:40.800\nAnd I was like, holy shit, and it wasn't, it wasn't like, holy shit, comedy can be so\n\n27:40.800 --> 27:41.800\nlayered and all this stuff.\n\n27:41.800 --> 27:47.600\nWhat it was was, holy shit, I'm supposed to be making myself laugh.\n\n27:47.600 --> 27:56.000\nI'm supposed to be, like there is no, there's no difference between the job of being funny\n\n27:56.000 --> 27:58.400\nfor other people and being funny for yourself.\n\n27:58.400 --> 27:59.720\nIt is the same thing.\n\n27:59.720 --> 28:04.080\nIt is the crazy thing about applause in this crowd that will get you.\n\n28:04.080 --> 28:08.160\nI love somebody who can applaud themselves.\n\n28:08.160 --> 28:10.240\nI denounced racism yesterday.\n\n28:10.240 --> 28:11.240\nCrickets.\n\n28:11.240 --> 28:16.880\nThese people are, these people hate minorities, they love comedy.\n\n28:16.880 --> 28:17.880\nThere are a lot of people.\n\n28:17.880 --> 28:18.880\nAnd they were here yesterday.\n\n28:18.880 --> 28:19.880\nI don't know.\n\n28:19.880 --> 28:20.880\nSorry.\n\n28:20.880 --> 28:22.880\nI love the Saturday practice shows.\n\n28:22.880 --> 28:25.720\nThis thing is so nailed down.\n\n28:25.720 --> 28:26.720\nAm I up?\n\n28:26.720 --> 28:30.680\nDid you, was that your line?\n\n28:30.680 --> 28:31.680\nRigorously rehearsed.\n\n28:31.680 --> 28:32.680\nRigorously rehearsed.\n\n28:32.680 --> 28:33.680\nMitch.\n\n28:33.680 --> 28:35.680\nDon't add lip.\n\n28:35.680 --> 28:46.240\nWe opened in two nights, you guys.\n\n28:46.240 --> 28:49.760\nI want to see you guys here at 7 a.m. and dressed for movement.\n\n28:49.760 --> 28:53.680\nAre the CERC guys coming or is it still us just marking them off with tape?\n\n28:53.680 --> 28:54.680\nThey'll be here.\n\n28:54.680 --> 28:58.360\nBecause they're going to throw us when they start doing the gymnastics.\n\n28:58.360 --> 29:02.240\nBut there is a question a good interviewer would ask you in there, which is, where did\n\n29:02.240 --> 29:03.720\nyou learn it from?\n\n29:03.720 --> 29:05.920\nBecause you're a couple years older than me.\n\n29:05.920 --> 29:06.920\nNo, I listen.\n\n29:06.920 --> 29:08.760\nIt's very nice that you say that you learned it from me.\n\n29:08.760 --> 29:09.760\nBut we're all like, I don't remember.\n\n29:09.760 --> 29:10.760\nNo, I'm not kidding.\n\n29:10.760 --> 29:11.760\nI'm telling you.\n\n29:11.760 --> 29:15.200\nIn terms of specifically, in terms of when sitting down to write a TV comedy script,\n\n29:15.200 --> 29:16.880\nI absolutely learned it from you.\n\n29:16.880 --> 29:20.560\nI also learned, I picked up, like Tina Fey doing 30 Rock.\n\n29:20.560 --> 29:24.280\nLike I definitely was like, holy shit, this is a pace that you can have.\n\n29:24.280 --> 29:27.480\nBut I would argue, I don't know if she'd disagree, that she learned it, she got that\n\n29:27.480 --> 29:28.480\nfrom you.\n\n29:28.480 --> 29:29.480\nI don't know.\n\n29:29.480 --> 29:30.480\nI don't know.\n\n29:30.480 --> 29:31.480\nI think she'd disagree.\n\n29:31.480 --> 29:35.920\nBut I think that you changed things with you.\n\n29:35.920 --> 29:36.920\nI got it from Ryan.\n\n29:36.920 --> 29:37.920\nI don't know if you watched Nip Tuck.\n\n29:37.920 --> 29:41.920\nI got a lot of it.\n\n29:41.920 --> 29:48.400\nI will say, I think that I remember being a kid, this will date me a little bit, and\n\n29:48.400 --> 29:51.480\nwatching Get Smart and Thinking is like a little kid.\n\n29:51.480 --> 29:57.800\nHow come all the shows sound the same that there's one where it doesn't sound the same?\n\n29:57.800 --> 30:01.200\nAnd basically what I was getting at is like, it's a guy's sense of humor.\n\n30:01.200 --> 30:02.200\nRight.\n\n30:02.200 --> 30:04.720\nWhatever you think of that sense of humor, it was clear that that was like Buck Henry\n\n30:04.720 --> 30:07.400\nand Mel Brooks.\n\n30:07.400 --> 30:11.440\nAnd for me, I think I remember seeing, like Larry Sander's show, that was a revelation.\n\n30:11.440 --> 30:16.120\nI remember seeing episodes where it would just end and you'd have to do a little thinking\n\n30:16.120 --> 30:17.120\nyourself.\n\n30:17.120 --> 30:21.040\nYou have to say, oh, he's in hell.\n\n30:21.040 --> 30:22.040\nHe's in hell.\n\n30:22.040 --> 30:26.600\nYou know, they didn't explain it, he didn't apologize.\n\n30:26.600 --> 30:28.080\nThat was amazing to me.\n\n30:28.080 --> 30:31.960\nAnd I also came up with a lot of writers that would say things like, well, we could do\n\n30:31.960 --> 30:35.360\nthe old, that was said in a lot of rooms I was in.\n\n30:35.360 --> 30:39.480\nAnd I remember at that point thinking like, I don't want to ever do the old.\n\n30:39.480 --> 30:40.480\nBut unfortunately-\n\n30:40.480 --> 30:41.800\nI often want to do the old.\n\n30:41.800 --> 30:44.560\nI strive, I scramble for it.\n\n30:44.560 --> 30:49.240\nI go, oh, oh, oh, this could be like the old thing because I don't know what I'm doing.\n\n30:49.240 --> 30:52.240\nBut that's because you're inventing it every time.\n\n30:52.240 --> 30:53.280\nThat's what I try to do.\n\n30:53.280 --> 30:55.280\nTry to invent it every time and that's the only way you're going to laugh.\n\n30:55.280 --> 30:58.360\nBut then it's just a bunch of people with their heads up their asses.\n\n30:58.360 --> 30:59.360\nI don't know.\n\n30:59.360 --> 31:03.160\nI don't know which version of me is more marketable.\n\n31:03.160 --> 31:07.360\nIs it the version that is trying to be like other people or is it the version that is-\n\n31:07.360 --> 31:08.360\nNo.\n\n31:08.360 --> 31:11.080\nI mean, listen, we're all, nobody's that independent.\n\n31:11.080 --> 31:14.480\nI mean, I probably could go through an episode of Rest of Development and say, oh, that's\n\n31:14.480 --> 31:15.480\nan Albert Brooks thing.\n\n31:15.480 --> 31:16.480\nThat's a Woody Allen thing.\n\n31:16.480 --> 31:18.080\nThat's a John Cleese thing.\n\n31:18.080 --> 31:20.720\nIt all gets filtered through somehow.\n\n31:20.720 --> 31:25.200\nBut for the most part, if you're trying to make yourself laugh, we happen to have chosen\n\n31:25.200 --> 31:30.840\na field that neither of us are really right for it because television is all about repetition.\n\n31:30.840 --> 31:32.480\nThat's what it does best.\n\n31:32.480 --> 31:33.800\nMaybe up until the current era.\n\n31:33.800 --> 31:34.800\nAmen.\n\n31:34.800 --> 31:35.800\nNow let's make an edit here.\n\n31:35.800 --> 31:39.480\nAnd for the podcast listeners, there's this brief silence and then some clicking sounds\n\n31:39.480 --> 31:40.480\nand then two gunshots.\n\n31:40.480 --> 31:41.480\nRight.\n\n31:41.480 --> 31:48.960\nCan we just get a, can we get a gas, but it's got to be clean.\n\n31:48.960 --> 31:49.960\nNo laughter.\n\n31:49.960 --> 31:55.680\nAnd then I'm going, so that would be amazing.\n\n31:55.680 --> 32:03.280\nAnd then, and then about like a three second silence and then slow applause.\n\n32:03.280 --> 32:06.920\nBut preceded by, I think I know how to help them.\n\n32:06.920 --> 32:10.160\nI'll cast a bet of me, Ryan Murphy, witchcraft.\n\n32:10.160 --> 32:11.160\nRyan Murphy.\n\n32:11.160 --> 32:12.160\nRyan Murphy.\n\n32:12.160 --> 32:13.160\nRyan Murphy.\n\n32:13.160 --> 32:16.160\nYou just need some voodoo magic from the bayou.\n\n32:16.160 --> 32:17.160\nFrom the bayou?\n\n32:17.160 --> 32:20.160\nFrom the bayou?\n\n32:20.160 --> 32:21.160\nIrish voodoo?\n\n32:21.160 --> 32:27.120\nI think, am I talking about the same guy as he, yeah, yeah, the glee guy is also the\n\n32:27.120 --> 32:28.120\nvoodoo witch guy, right?\n\n32:28.120 --> 32:29.120\nThe voodoo witch guy.\n\n32:29.120 --> 32:34.480\nHe was raised in the bayou and then he went to Ireland and then he decided to comment\n\n32:34.480 --> 32:38.320\non, on superficiality in America.\n\n32:38.320 --> 32:42.800\nThat's why that's so rich.\n\n32:42.800 --> 32:45.560\nSpeaking of diversity, let's bring out Kumail Nagyane.\n\n32:45.560 --> 32:56.320\nThat is the single greatest intro I've ever gotten.\n\n32:56.320 --> 32:58.320\nSpeaking of diversity.\n\n32:58.320 --> 33:00.720\nNo, you're supposed to do the speaking of diversity now.\n\n33:00.720 --> 33:01.720\nYeah.\n\n33:01.720 --> 33:02.720\nDo you mind speaking about diversity?\n\n33:02.720 --> 33:03.720\nI think it's good, guys.\n\n33:03.720 --> 33:04.720\nI am on board.\n\n33:04.720 --> 33:09.480\nFor one thing, it's my, it's my sole recourse to an intro.\n\n33:09.480 --> 33:10.480\nYeah.\n\n33:10.480 --> 33:14.120\nCan I say something that happened backstage, is that okay, Mitch?\n\n33:14.120 --> 33:19.600\nWe were hanging out back, back there and Mitch came in, Mitch Hurwitz, creator of Restor\n\n33:19.600 --> 33:20.600\nDevelopment.\n\n33:20.600 --> 33:21.600\nAnd he came up to me.\n\n33:21.600 --> 33:23.600\nI got two intros and you got barely one.\n\n33:23.600 --> 33:25.600\nI didn't get any intros.\n\n33:25.600 --> 33:30.560\nBut he came in and he shook my hand and he was like, oh, hey, we met a couple months\n\n33:30.560 --> 33:37.760\nago and I was like, you will never have to remind me of when I met you.\n\n33:37.760 --> 33:38.760\nBecause you're Indian?\n\n33:38.760 --> 33:39.760\nWe never forget.\n\n33:39.760 --> 33:44.760\nI'm Pakistani, but that's fine.\n\n33:44.760 --> 33:45.760\nYeah.\n\n33:45.760 --> 33:49.760\nIf you, if you squint at look, Indian, I hate Indians.\n\n33:49.760 --> 33:50.760\nYeah.\n\n33:50.760 --> 33:51.760\nYeah.\n\n33:51.760 --> 33:52.760\nOh my God.\n\n33:52.760 --> 33:53.760\nThanks for coming.\n\n33:53.760 --> 33:54.760\nThis has been a great picture.\n\n33:54.760 --> 33:55.760\nYeah.\n\n33:55.760 --> 33:56.760\nYeah.\n\n33:56.760 --> 33:57.760\nI'm the opposite of Indian.\n\n33:57.760 --> 33:58.760\nYeah.\n\n33:58.760 --> 33:59.760\nAssholes.\n\n33:59.760 --> 34:00.760\nThe opposite of Indian.\n\n34:00.760 --> 34:01.760\nYeah.\n\n34:01.760 --> 34:02.760\nThat's your drama.\n\n34:02.760 --> 34:03.760\nYeah.\n\n34:03.760 --> 34:08.800\nWe're the opposite of Indians and the opposite of Jews, I guess.\n\n34:08.800 --> 34:09.800\nNot fond of them either.\n\n34:09.800 --> 34:13.240\nA lot of you go into cardiology.\n\n34:13.240 --> 34:14.240\nMy people?\n\n34:14.240 --> 34:15.240\nDon't they?\n\n34:15.240 --> 34:16.240\nOh, yeah.\n\n34:16.240 --> 34:17.240\nWell, doctor, doctor.\n\n34:17.240 --> 34:18.240\nYeah.\n\n34:18.240 --> 34:19.240\nWe're mostly doctors.\n\n34:19.240 --> 34:20.240\nYeah.\n\n34:20.240 --> 34:23.040\nIs that why would you, is that why I feel comforted by your voice?\n\n34:23.040 --> 34:24.040\nMaybe?\n\n34:24.040 --> 34:25.040\nI don't know.\n\n34:25.040 --> 34:26.040\nI wonder if you'd feel comforted.\n\n34:26.040 --> 34:31.720\nI wonder if I've ever had a doctor that was telling me my heart would be okay and\n\n34:31.720 --> 34:32.720\nhe had.\n\n34:32.720 --> 34:33.720\nYeah.\n\n34:33.720 --> 34:34.720\nMy dad's a doctor.\n\n34:34.720 --> 34:38.400\nI think my mom's waiting for me to play a doctor in a show so she can commit suicide\n\n34:38.400 --> 34:40.680\nwhile she's watching it.\n\n34:40.680 --> 34:41.680\nShe wouldn't like that.\n\n34:41.680 --> 34:42.680\nNo.\n\n34:42.680 --> 34:46.120\nI think she would be like, oh, if I, now you're mocking your father and, but that's a happy\n\n34:46.120 --> 34:47.120\nthing there.\n\n34:47.120 --> 34:48.120\nNo.\n\n34:48.120 --> 34:49.120\nIt's a happy thing.\n\n34:49.120 --> 34:50.120\nOh, commit suicide.\n\n34:50.120 --> 34:51.120\nSuicide is a good thing.\n\n34:51.120 --> 34:52.120\nOh.\n\n34:52.120 --> 34:53.120\nIt's the most honorable death possible.\n\n34:53.120 --> 34:54.120\nRight.\n\n34:54.120 --> 34:55.120\nRight.\n\n34:55.120 --> 34:56.120\nOh boy.\n\n34:56.120 --> 34:57.120\nHere he goes again.\n\n34:57.120 --> 34:58.120\nOh boy.\n\n34:58.120 --> 35:00.360\nIt's an honorable death.\n\n35:00.360 --> 35:05.240\nWe have to set ourselves on fire to get it to heaven.\n\n35:05.240 --> 35:08.520\nCan male, can male save it for your blog?\n\n35:08.520 --> 35:13.920\nDid I read correctly that you were voted sexiest man of the year by Salon magazine?\n\n35:13.920 --> 35:14.920\nYeah.\n\n35:14.920 --> 35:16.480\nIt wasn't a vote.\n\n35:16.480 --> 35:19.520\nIt was some person decided.\n\n35:19.520 --> 35:21.520\nJason Salon decided.\n\n35:21.520 --> 35:23.520\nI don't know.\n\n35:23.520 --> 35:24.520\nYeah.\n\n35:24.520 --> 35:25.520\nIt was weird.\n\n35:25.520 --> 35:26.520\nIt's very cool.\n\n35:26.520 --> 35:32.760\nIt's obviously, and not to say anything about it, Salon, they have a lot of white guilt\n\n35:32.760 --> 35:34.000\nin there.\n\n35:34.000 --> 35:38.600\nAnd I think this was their way of like, hey, this should make you guys feel better.\n\n35:38.600 --> 35:43.760\nI mean, you're a very attractive man, but I can see the guilt in that.\n\n35:43.760 --> 35:48.080\nWhat I also like is that the description of the article was like, we didn't go off to\n\n35:48.080 --> 35:50.880\nguys who hang out in the gym or anything.\n\n35:50.880 --> 35:57.120\nWhy did you have to put that in there?\n\n35:57.120 --> 36:03.840\nWe, yeah, we use the term sexy and a little looser around Salon.\n\n36:03.840 --> 36:07.560\nOne of them is just a really great orange I ate yesterday.\n\n36:07.560 --> 36:13.960\nWe're not sure the other ones is 10 and you're the only human here.\n\n36:13.960 --> 36:15.680\nCheck out this park bench.\n\n36:15.680 --> 36:18.120\nErgonomics are the new pecs.\n\n36:18.120 --> 36:19.120\nYeah.\n\n36:19.120 --> 36:20.120\nNumber three.\n\n36:20.120 --> 36:21.120\nThere's no future on my episode.\n\n36:21.120 --> 36:22.120\nNumber three.\n\n36:22.120 --> 36:23.120\nCalcium.\n\n36:23.120 --> 36:24.120\nYeah.\n\n36:24.120 --> 36:31.320\nSalon.com is number six on their own list of sexiest man.\n\n36:31.320 --> 36:32.320\nCome on, that's silly.\n\n36:32.320 --> 36:33.320\nYou're very sexy.\n\n36:33.320 --> 36:34.320\nThank you guys.\n\n36:34.320 --> 36:35.320\nThank you.\n\n36:35.320 --> 36:36.320\nCome on.\n\n36:36.320 --> 36:37.320\nCome on.\n\n36:37.320 --> 36:38.320\nCome on.\n\n36:38.320 --> 36:39.440\nDo something really sexy.\n\n36:39.440 --> 36:40.440\nTake your shirt off.\n\n36:40.440 --> 36:42.880\nTake your fucking shirt off.\n\n36:42.880 --> 36:43.880\nTake your shirt off.\n\n36:43.880 --> 36:44.880\nNo.\n\n36:44.880 --> 36:45.880\nCome on, hot shot.\n\n36:45.880 --> 36:46.880\nYou're a public figure.\n\n36:46.880 --> 36:47.880\nIt's not harassment.\n\n36:47.880 --> 36:51.000\nI'll be bullied by mature ones.\n\n36:51.000 --> 36:59.560\nIt's not bullying if you're voted sexy.\n\n36:59.560 --> 37:01.400\nYou're a public figure now.\n\n37:01.400 --> 37:05.000\nAnyway, quick edit, we're going to go back to the music, cheer like you took a shirt\n\n37:05.000 --> 37:06.000\noff.\n\n37:06.000 --> 37:07.000\nWait, wait, wait.\n\n37:07.000 --> 37:08.000\nWe'll let the music go for a second.\n\n37:08.000 --> 37:09.000\nJesus Christ.\n\n37:09.000 --> 37:10.000\nHoly cow.\n\n37:10.000 --> 37:11.000\nLook at those tips.\n\n37:11.000 --> 37:21.960\nIf we could do a gunshot and a gasp again.\n\n37:21.960 --> 37:22.960\nRight.\n\n37:22.960 --> 37:24.240\nOh my God, his pecs look so good.\n\n37:24.240 --> 37:27.760\nMitch, you thinking what I'm thinking?\n\n37:27.760 --> 37:28.760\nGasp.\n\n37:28.760 --> 37:38.440\nOh my God, gasp take, that's a great, this show is going to take a couple of days to\n\n37:38.440 --> 37:39.440\ncome out.\n\n37:39.440 --> 37:41.440\nThis one will not drop tomorrow.\n\n37:41.440 --> 37:46.920\nNo, you got to go up to like Skywalker Ranch, get the really good quality guys.\n\n37:46.920 --> 37:50.600\nWe have to go back and add the sound effects of me and Mitch sucking each other's dicks\n\n37:50.600 --> 37:53.400\nfor the last half hour.\n\n37:53.400 --> 37:56.880\nYou don't need to add sound effects.\n\n37:56.880 --> 38:00.480\nThe tape was rolling backstage, you guys.\n\n38:00.480 --> 38:04.360\nAxely said, Axely said.\n\n38:04.360 --> 38:09.400\nI actually didn't add some of my parents' calls for three days because of that article.\n\n38:09.400 --> 38:10.400\nReally?\n\n38:10.400 --> 38:11.400\nYeah.\n\n38:11.400 --> 38:12.400\nI really didn't.\n\n38:12.400 --> 38:13.400\nI haven't talked to them since then.\n\n38:13.400 --> 38:14.400\nBecause your phone is ringing off the hook?\n\n38:14.400 --> 38:19.360\nNo, nobody, they are calling, they want to talk about it, and I don't want to talk to\n\n38:19.360 --> 38:20.360\nthem about it.\n\n38:20.360 --> 38:24.560\nAnd they're thinking, oh, now he's Mr. Sexy, he doesn't pick up my phone calls anymore.\n\n38:24.560 --> 38:25.560\nDo you think that...\n\n38:25.560 --> 38:26.560\nNow they'll never go to medical school.\n\n38:26.560 --> 38:30.520\nI wish she was Dr. Sexy, yeah.\n\n38:30.520 --> 38:33.920\nWhat do you think your mom's take on that would be?\n\n38:33.920 --> 38:40.040\nWell, I'll tell you what was weird is that in the article they wrote that I had a fundamentalist\n\n38:40.040 --> 38:43.800\nupbringing, which is a very specific word, and it is not what I had at a conservative\n\n38:43.800 --> 38:45.320\nshared Muslim upbringing.\n\n38:45.320 --> 38:48.320\nAnd it took a lot to get them to take that word out.\n\n38:48.320 --> 38:51.800\nAnd my brother texted me like, what the fuck?\n\n38:51.800 --> 38:53.920\nDid you have a different upbringing than me?\n\n38:53.920 --> 38:58.880\nAnd I was like, yeah, they made me do like push-ups and pull-ups in the back.\n\n38:58.880 --> 39:04.360\nI was doing the monkey bars, they're always doing that when they show like those terrorist\n\n39:04.360 --> 39:05.360\ntraining.\n\n39:05.360 --> 39:06.360\nThat's how you get sexy.\n\n39:06.360 --> 39:07.360\nThey're just doing monkey bars.\n\n39:07.360 --> 39:09.960\nYou must be amazing at the monkey bars now.\n\n39:09.960 --> 39:10.960\nYeah.\n\n39:10.960 --> 39:12.880\nI can jump into tires really well.\n\n39:12.880 --> 39:13.880\nYeah.\n\n39:13.880 --> 39:17.880\nIt's tough to get a bunch of guys together on a Saturday, just go use the monkey bars.\n\n39:17.880 --> 39:20.520\nTough to not get in a league.\n\n39:20.520 --> 39:23.840\nMy favorite thing in war movies was when a bunch of guys stood in a line with bayonets\n\n39:23.840 --> 39:25.440\nand they had to go stab a sack.\n\n39:25.440 --> 39:26.440\nYeah.\n\n39:26.440 --> 39:27.440\nLike a thicket sack.\n\n39:27.440 --> 39:28.440\nYeah, now you're ready.\n\n39:28.440 --> 39:29.440\nLet's go and make sack land.\n\n39:29.440 --> 39:34.120\nYou land in Vietnam and you're like, well, there are no playgrounds here, we haven't\n\n39:34.120 --> 39:35.120\nprepared.\n\n39:35.120 --> 39:37.560\nThere are no evenly spaced...\n\n39:37.560 --> 39:40.160\nEveryone here has arms and legs and is shooting at me.\n\n39:40.160 --> 39:41.160\nYeah.\n\n39:41.160 --> 39:42.880\nWhy did we spend months going down that slide?\n\n39:42.880 --> 39:43.880\nYeah.\n\n39:43.880 --> 39:48.440\nI could use a seesaw as a death weapon, but we have none here.\n\n39:48.440 --> 39:53.560\nDo you ever have to really go under all the barbed wire with a drill sergeant kicking\n\n39:53.560 --> 39:54.560\nyour butt down?\n\n39:54.560 --> 39:58.640\nHave they now figured out to put barbed wire all the way to the bottom?\n\n39:58.640 --> 40:01.200\nYou know, 60 years later.\n\n40:01.200 --> 40:03.000\nYeah, we've got to do this.\n\n40:03.000 --> 40:04.720\nWe've got to put it on the ground.\n\n40:04.720 --> 40:05.720\nJust lay it down.\n\n40:05.720 --> 40:06.720\nStop putting it up on stands.\n\n40:06.720 --> 40:08.800\nIt's easier.\n\n40:08.800 --> 40:12.520\nAnd make this wall get these ropes out of here.\n\n40:12.520 --> 40:14.920\nWell, that's how they're getting over.\n\n40:14.920 --> 40:17.560\nFor God's sakes, this is Normandy, not an open house.\n\n40:17.560 --> 40:18.560\nWho said they couldn't?\n\n40:18.560 --> 40:20.560\nWho said they wouldn't be able to climb the ropes?\n\n40:20.560 --> 40:21.560\nWho said that?\n\n40:21.560 --> 40:24.560\nThat's all we've been practicing for years.\n\n40:24.560 --> 40:26.560\nWho said the ropes would scare them?\n\n40:26.560 --> 40:28.560\nThey're using the ropes.\n\n40:28.560 --> 40:30.560\nThey're climbing the ropes.\n\n40:30.560 --> 40:31.560\nThey don't think they're snakes.\n\n40:31.560 --> 40:33.560\nThey put gnats in them.\n\n40:33.560 --> 40:34.560\nThey'll never get here.\n\n40:34.560 --> 40:37.560\nWe have a bridge made of tires protecting us.\n\n40:37.560 --> 40:41.560\nNo, look at their wide stance while they run.\n\n40:41.560 --> 40:46.560\nYeah, they'll waddle over.\n\n40:46.560 --> 40:50.560\nBecause it's like, how do you train someone to become a killing machine?\n\n40:50.560 --> 40:53.560\nYou can't, so you're like, oh, distract them with tires and ropes.\n\n40:53.560 --> 40:55.560\nOkay, four square guys, let's go.\n\n40:55.560 --> 40:56.560\nYeah, exactly.\n\n40:56.560 --> 41:00.560\nThey do always say, if you watch a Word documentary, that's the first thing that they always say.\n\n41:00.560 --> 41:04.560\nAll the GIs will say, the veterans that they interviewed, they're like, well, we got there,\n\n41:04.560 --> 41:07.560\nand we had not prepared for this.\n\n41:07.560 --> 41:08.560\nNo shit.\n\n41:08.560 --> 41:10.560\nLike, definitely not.\n\n41:10.560 --> 41:17.560\nNo one has ever invaded a military training ground in Minnesota.\n\n41:17.560 --> 41:20.560\nThere's one wall, but we all wanted to hide behind it.\n\n41:20.560 --> 41:21.560\nNobody wanted to go over it.\n\n41:21.560 --> 41:23.560\nAll the people could move.\n\n41:23.560 --> 41:26.560\nNone of them were stationary sack people.\n\n41:26.560 --> 41:29.560\nBut now the training is very much like the actual war, right?\n\n41:29.560 --> 41:31.560\nBecause it's like, end this game now.\n\n41:31.560 --> 41:33.560\nOh, I bet it is.\n\n41:33.560 --> 41:34.560\nI call it duty.\n\n41:34.560 --> 41:37.560\nI'm looking at you guys as people who might read the news now.\n\n41:37.560 --> 41:42.560\nI did hear that Amazon is going to use drones to deliver their fucking...\n\n41:42.560 --> 41:43.560\nIsn't that crazy?\n\n41:43.560 --> 41:44.560\nNot really.\n\n41:44.560 --> 41:45.560\nI heard the end of an Amazon story.\n\n41:45.560 --> 41:46.560\nIs that what it was?\n\n41:46.560 --> 41:48.560\nYeah, they're going to use drones.\n\n41:48.560 --> 41:49.560\nTo deliver what?\n\n41:49.560 --> 41:51.560\nTo deliver, like, just, you know...\n\n41:51.560 --> 41:53.560\nA copy of Eat, Pray, Love.\n\n41:53.560 --> 41:54.560\nOr, yeah.\n\n41:54.560 --> 41:55.560\n30,000 feet.\n\n41:55.560 --> 41:56.560\nWait, wait, wait, wait.\n\n41:56.560 --> 41:58.560\nYeah, Nip Tuck Box said that.\n\n41:58.560 --> 42:01.560\nWell, that'd be a Google Chromecast module.\n\n42:01.560 --> 42:03.560\nA little parachute comes down and lands on my mailbox.\n\n42:03.560 --> 42:04.560\nLike, how does it...\n\n42:04.560 --> 42:06.560\nI think they haven't worked out all the details yet.\n\n42:06.560 --> 42:08.560\nI don't know how it's going to...\n\n42:08.560 --> 42:10.560\nI mean, there's going to be collateral damage.\n\n42:10.560 --> 42:13.560\nThey are tied to bombs, yeah.\n\n42:13.560 --> 42:15.560\nAnd I don't mean...\n\n42:15.560 --> 42:17.560\nBut that switch is set to off.\n\n42:17.560 --> 42:19.560\nNot that that was a bomb.\n\n42:19.560 --> 42:21.560\nThat all feels so.\n\n42:21.560 --> 42:27.560\nIf they're delivering your groceries like that, the bomb switch is off.\n\n42:27.560 --> 42:28.560\nYeah, yeah, I hope so.\n\n42:28.560 --> 42:30.560\nI hope they don't get confused.\n\n42:30.560 --> 42:34.560\nAnd then, we're getting bombs and someone in Pakistan has the Nip Tuck Box said.\n\n42:34.560 --> 42:36.560\nWhat the hell?\n\n42:36.560 --> 42:38.560\nThis is actually a good wedding present.\n\n42:38.560 --> 42:39.560\nThank you.\n\n42:39.560 --> 42:41.560\nYes.\n\n42:41.560 --> 42:46.560\nThis is Sony Aibo Dog, just talking about our direct TV.\n\n42:46.560 --> 42:48.560\nYeah, we got an Apple TV.\n\n42:48.560 --> 42:51.560\nWe have nothing to plug it into.\n\n42:51.560 --> 42:55.560\nI told you, Dan, I did a couple of USO tours with Drew Carey.\n\n42:55.560 --> 42:58.560\nWe did, like, improv for troops around, like, before the Iraq invasion,\n\n42:58.560 --> 43:00.560\nbut after Afghanistan.\n\n43:00.560 --> 43:04.560\nAnd they took us into, like, in the middle of a desert, there's a war room.\n\n43:04.560 --> 43:07.560\nThere's this big yellow building in the middle of nowhere in the desert.\n\n43:07.560 --> 43:09.560\nThis big yellow metal building.\n\n43:09.560 --> 43:12.560\nAnd in that building was more bandwidth going into it at that time.\n\n43:12.560 --> 43:15.560\nThey said in the Kremlin and maybe the Pentagon.\n\n43:15.560 --> 43:18.560\nI can't believe it's true, but the whole war was being run from there.\n\n43:18.560 --> 43:20.560\nAnd there was a war games.\n\n43:20.560 --> 43:22.560\nLike, you went up to the top floor.\n\n43:22.560 --> 43:27.560\nThere's these giant tilted, like, tinted windows looking down on a sea of computers\n\n43:27.560 --> 43:29.560\nand people in front of these computers.\n\n43:29.560 --> 43:34.560\nAnd on these walls, these giant movie screens of, one, is a satellite map.\n\n43:34.560 --> 43:38.560\nOne is a, that can change different arenas or areas.\n\n43:38.560 --> 43:40.560\nAnother, a giant map of the whole region.\n\n43:40.560 --> 43:43.560\nAnd, like, digital blips of everything.\n\n43:43.560 --> 43:45.560\nThe blue is medical units.\n\n43:45.560 --> 43:47.560\nThe orange is infantry units.\n\n43:47.560 --> 43:48.560\nThe red is this.\n\n43:48.560 --> 43:50.560\nAnd then just chuck and buck on one of them.\n\n43:50.560 --> 43:53.560\nFor some reason, they were just like, chuck and buck.\n\n43:53.560 --> 43:55.560\nNot just something that came out of it.\n\n43:55.560 --> 43:56.560\nNot far off.\n\n43:56.560 --> 43:57.560\nYou're actually not far off.\n\n43:57.560 --> 43:59.560\nIt was CNN on the other one.\n\n43:59.560 --> 44:02.560\nFor now, not much different.\n\n44:02.560 --> 44:06.560\nBut we were up there and we walked up there and they turned off a couple computer screens.\n\n44:06.560 --> 44:08.560\nThey left a couple on.\n\n44:08.560 --> 44:14.560\nAnd one was a picture of a black and white aerial satellite photo.\n\n44:14.560 --> 44:16.560\nAnd I asked like a kernel or something.\n\n44:16.560 --> 44:17.560\nI said, what's this?\n\n44:17.560 --> 44:20.560\nHe goes, oh, this photo was taken five minutes ago.\n\n44:20.560 --> 44:21.560\nHe goes, we can do it in color.\n\n44:21.560 --> 44:22.560\nWe can do it, however.\n\n44:22.560 --> 44:25.560\nWe can also have it like right now, but we don't really need to.\n\n44:25.560 --> 44:27.560\nThey had Instagram before we did.\n\n44:27.560 --> 44:28.560\nOh, yeah.\n\n44:28.560 --> 44:29.560\nOh, that's what we could do.\n\n44:29.560 --> 44:34.560\nWe could do this Sierra X-Pro 2.\n\n44:34.560 --> 44:36.560\nNashville, would you have a little thing with this?\n\n44:36.560 --> 44:37.560\nNashville.\n\n44:37.560 --> 44:40.560\nIt was just a Taliban pictures of stuff they were eating.\n\n44:40.560 --> 44:42.560\nThere was a picture of a guy.\n\n44:42.560 --> 44:44.560\nThere was a picture of a guy like BFF.\n\n44:44.560 --> 44:46.560\nAnd then there was a heart.\n\n44:46.560 --> 44:47.560\nWish you were here.\n\n44:47.560 --> 44:49.560\nAnd then there was a picture of someone.\n\n44:49.560 --> 44:50.560\nThey zoomed in really close.\n\n44:50.560 --> 44:52.560\nAnd it was a picture of an espresso with a heart in it.\n\n44:52.560 --> 44:53.560\nWow.\n\n44:53.560 --> 44:55.560\nYeah, really.\n\n44:55.560 --> 44:58.560\nI asked the guy, he zooms in on a guy, and you can see a guy there.\n\n44:58.560 --> 44:59.560\nWho is that?\n\n44:59.560 --> 45:00.560\nHe goes, that's just a farmer.\n\n45:00.560 --> 45:02.560\nHe's probably like, zoom in on guys?\n\n45:02.560 --> 45:03.560\nYeah.\n\n45:03.560 --> 45:05.560\nI go, what's the resolution you have here?\n\n45:05.560 --> 45:06.560\nHe goes, we load it in.\n\n45:06.560 --> 45:08.560\nThe resolution is to fuck humanity.\n\n45:08.560 --> 45:09.560\nExactly.\n\n45:09.560 --> 45:10.560\nExactly.\n\n45:10.560 --> 45:11.560\nYeah.\n\n45:11.560 --> 45:12.560\nFuck that guy for farming.\n\n45:12.560 --> 45:13.560\nThat's the resolution.\n\n45:13.560 --> 45:17.560\nOur resolution is to win a thousand times over.\n\n45:17.560 --> 45:19.560\nSee that guy with the pilot rocks?\n\n45:19.560 --> 45:21.560\nWe don't just make it New Year's Eve.\n\n45:21.560 --> 45:24.560\nI said, could you see if the guy's shoes were tied or untied?\n\n45:24.560 --> 45:27.560\nHe goes, if you were holding a dime, I could tell you what year it was.\n\n45:27.560 --> 45:30.560\nBut the good news is he has no money and shoes that don't lace.\n\n45:30.560 --> 45:31.560\nExactly.\n\n45:31.560 --> 45:33.560\nJust don't worry about it.\n\n45:33.560 --> 45:34.560\nThat's what I like about you, Mitch.\n\n45:34.560 --> 45:35.560\nWe're going to Bright Side.\n\n45:35.560 --> 45:37.560\nYou're a Bright Side guy.\n\n45:37.560 --> 45:39.560\nWe have a lot of wasted resolution.\n\n45:39.560 --> 45:41.560\nSo then they have no money.\n\n45:41.560 --> 45:43.560\nThat's how they've chosen to evade us.\n\n45:43.560 --> 45:46.560\nLike living in games and not having a dime in their hand.\n\n45:46.560 --> 45:51.560\nThere's a radio shack flight simulator joystick there and he goes, watch this.\n\n45:51.560 --> 45:55.560\nHe zooms back and then you see some details of a farm and then a thing.\n\n45:55.560 --> 45:57.560\nAnd then you see borders of countries.\n\n45:57.560 --> 45:58.560\nThen you see the region.\n\n45:58.560 --> 46:01.560\nThen you see the planet Earth and it's upside down because they were doing it for that right.\n\n46:01.560 --> 46:02.560\nThen he hits a button.\n\n46:02.560 --> 46:05.560\nAnd then it pulls back and it's Oprah holding it in her hands.\n\n46:05.560 --> 46:08.560\nI was going to say just one masculine claw.\n\n46:08.560 --> 46:09.560\nToo far, too far.\n\n46:09.560 --> 46:12.560\nAnd then he goes, oh yeah, they turned the monitor off.\n\n46:12.560 --> 46:13.560\nOh shit.\n\n46:13.560 --> 46:15.560\nRedacted, redacted.\n\n46:15.560 --> 46:19.560\nAnd I said to him, I said, and you guys can't find Osama bin Laden.\n\n46:19.560 --> 46:24.560\nAnd he kind of gave me like, if we find Osama, this is all over.\n\n46:24.560 --> 46:25.560\nYeah, exactly.\n\n46:25.560 --> 46:30.560\nBut he gave me a look like, we can, like we find what they ask us to look for, man.\n\n46:30.560 --> 46:32.560\nAnd then we went on a plane.\n\n46:32.560 --> 46:35.560\nNo one had thought to say, hey, look for Osama.\n\n46:35.560 --> 46:41.560\nHe said, I go, we have more bandwidth coming into this building than any building ever.\n\n46:41.560 --> 46:45.560\nAnd I said, what does that mean exactly to like explain that to me?\n\n46:45.560 --> 46:48.560\nAnd he goes, if it exists as information, I can get it right now.\n\n46:48.560 --> 46:50.560\nI'm gay.\n\n46:50.560 --> 46:55.560\nDan, I'm trying to tell a story.\n\n46:55.560 --> 47:00.560\nWe'll table your homosexuality for a moment now.\n\n47:00.560 --> 47:02.560\nI don't know what that test was.\n\n47:02.560 --> 47:04.560\nThe story is taking place in the past.\n\n47:04.560 --> 47:07.560\nBut then we go on this plane with a bunch of people.\n\n47:07.560 --> 47:10.560\nThere's all these antennae like off the bottom of it and they fly around.\n\n47:10.560 --> 47:11.560\nAnd I forget the name of the plane.\n\n47:11.560 --> 47:15.560\nAnd there's all these people, they're linguists and they listen.\n\n47:15.560 --> 47:18.560\nAnd I walked on the plane and they all turned off their screens.\n\n47:18.560 --> 47:20.560\nLike that's like some secret.\n\n47:20.560 --> 47:21.560\nSecret shit.\n\n47:21.560 --> 47:24.560\nAnd I was talking to a guy that works in that plane.\n\n47:24.560 --> 47:25.560\nI go, so what are you guys listening for?\n\n47:25.560 --> 47:27.560\nHe goes, they ask us to listen for certain communications.\n\n47:27.560 --> 47:28.560\nWe find Taliban people.\n\n47:28.560 --> 47:30.560\nWe find this, we find that, we find targets.\n\n47:30.560 --> 47:32.560\nWe radio that into the bombers or the fighters.\n\n47:32.560 --> 47:34.560\nThey go in there and they get those targets.\n\n47:34.560 --> 47:37.560\nI go, how do you know that those targets are still there when the bombers get there?\n\n47:37.560 --> 47:38.560\nAnd he goes, that's not our department.\n\n47:38.560 --> 47:39.560\nThat's crazy.\n\n47:39.560 --> 47:41.560\nAnd so I said, well, what do you, what can you hear?\n\n47:41.560 --> 47:44.560\nAnd he goes, I can't tell you everything that we can hear.\n\n47:44.560 --> 47:45.560\nBecause that's top secret.\n\n47:45.560 --> 47:49.560\nBut I will say that this enemy in particular has no idea what we can hear.\n\n47:49.560 --> 47:50.560\nAnd he goes, for instance.\n\n47:50.560 --> 47:58.560\nHe probably thought, well, I can really tell you because it's not like you're ever going to tell a Pakistani.\n\n47:58.560 --> 48:01.560\nWell, with all that change in your pockets and those shoelaces.\n\n48:01.560 --> 48:17.560\nThat you would tell this whole story to a Shia Muslim.\n\n48:17.560 --> 48:19.560\nSo he goes, I will say this.\n\n48:19.560 --> 48:20.560\nWe can listen to you.\n\n48:20.560 --> 48:24.560\nIf you're at home and your phones are hung up, like your cell phone or your like your landlines are hung up.\n\n48:24.560 --> 48:26.560\nWe can listen to you through those.\n\n48:26.560 --> 48:27.560\nCome on.\n\n48:27.560 --> 48:30.560\nAnd he goes, I said, and that's what you can tell me?\n\n48:30.560 --> 48:35.560\nAnd he goes, he goes, they know that kind of, but we're catching them on their cell phones all the time.\n\n48:35.560 --> 48:37.560\nI go, so tell me what you can tell me.\n\n48:37.560 --> 48:40.560\nHe goes, if it travels over a wave, we can hear it.\n\n48:40.560 --> 48:43.560\nAnd I go, aren't our voices traveling over waves right now?\n\n48:43.560 --> 48:46.560\nAnd he gave me the same smile the other guy did.\n\n48:46.560 --> 48:48.560\nThe response said, what?\n\n48:48.560 --> 48:51.560\nI said, go get this fucking guy.\n\n48:51.560 --> 48:53.560\nIt's like, not my department.\n\n48:53.560 --> 48:55.560\nLike, they tell us where to go.\n\n48:55.560 --> 48:56.560\nWhat to listen to.\n\n48:56.560 --> 48:57.560\nWhat to do.\n\n48:57.560 --> 49:03.560\nIs this one of those situations where then the real guy comes in and is like, get to work and that guy is the janitor.\n\n49:03.560 --> 49:05.560\nLike, I'm sorry.\n\n49:05.560 --> 49:07.560\nAre you doing it again?\n\n49:07.560 --> 49:09.560\nHe gets your diamond shoelace.\n\n49:09.560 --> 49:11.560\nIt's true carry.\n\n49:11.560 --> 49:13.560\nIt's true carry.\n\n49:13.560 --> 49:15.560\nBy your own mission, this was before Iraq.\n\n49:15.560 --> 49:19.560\nMay I hazard a guess as to why they couldn't find Osama bin Laden?\n\n49:19.560 --> 49:21.560\nThis can get really political guys.\n\n49:21.560 --> 49:22.560\nI hope you're okay with this.\n\n49:22.560 --> 49:26.560\nNo one listens this far into the podcast.\n\n49:26.560 --> 49:29.560\nHe might be in Iraq.\n\n49:29.560 --> 49:31.560\nCan't find him.\n\n49:31.560 --> 49:32.560\nYou think why?\n\n49:32.560 --> 49:33.560\nThat's why?\n\n49:33.560 --> 49:37.560\nI think that I think he was somewhere else and he wasn't high priority.\n\n49:37.560 --> 49:39.560\nOsama was it?\n\n49:39.560 --> 49:40.560\nI don't know.\n\n49:40.560 --> 49:42.560\nI really do believe with the intelligence.\n\n49:42.560 --> 49:45.560\nYou mean he was in Iraq in the tent next to where Jeff was?\n\n49:45.560 --> 49:47.560\nTrue carry.\n\n49:47.560 --> 49:50.560\nNo, I will listen.\n\n49:50.560 --> 49:53.560\nI actually just watched that Oliver Stone documentary, which is amazing.\n\n49:53.560 --> 49:57.560\nIf anybody hasn't seen the untold history of the United States, I can't tell you what it is.\n\n49:57.560 --> 49:59.560\nIt's untold.\n\n49:59.560 --> 50:02.560\nIt's just a black screen for an hour and a half.\n\n50:02.560 --> 50:05.560\nBut your imagination goes wild.\n\n50:05.560 --> 50:09.560\nIsn't Oliver Stone like the worst historian of all time?\n\n50:09.560 --> 50:12.560\nI do believe he put a little too much on Jim Garrison's back in JFK.\n\n50:12.560 --> 50:14.560\nHe really did.\n\n50:14.560 --> 50:17.560\nIt's a very valuable work.\n\n50:17.560 --> 50:22.560\nBut he was very right about platoon because people only spoke in cliches.\n\n50:22.560 --> 50:24.560\nThat's why we lost.\n\n50:24.560 --> 50:26.560\nWe were at war with our own language.\n\n50:26.560 --> 50:32.560\nWe were too busy writing grammar about grunts and calling people cheesedick.\n\n50:32.560 --> 50:34.560\nPlatoon.\n\n50:34.560 --> 50:37.560\nBack then that was an insult.\n\n50:37.560 --> 50:46.560\nHow is it that if they have that, why are they still like drone bombing weddings and stuff in Afghanistan and Pakistan?\n\n50:46.560 --> 50:49.560\nThat was supposed to be rice.\n\n50:49.560 --> 50:52.560\nThis is the worst rice I've ever had.\n\n50:52.560 --> 50:55.560\nThat was an Amazon drone.\n\n50:55.560 --> 50:57.560\nI know what you're talking about.\n\n50:57.560 --> 50:59.560\nI put that on my wish list.\n\n50:59.560 --> 51:01.560\nI don't know what I'm doing.\n\n51:01.560 --> 51:03.560\nI'm like Robin Williams now.\n\n51:03.560 --> 51:05.560\nWish list, Amazon.\n\n51:05.560 --> 51:07.560\nHashtag.\n\n51:07.560 --> 51:09.560\nHashtags and bacon.\n\n51:09.560 --> 51:11.560\nThat was pretty good.\n\n51:11.560 --> 51:15.560\nThat was a pretty good Robin Williams.\n\n51:15.560 --> 51:20.560\nMitch Hurwitz is Robin Williams. What should I do tomorrow?\n\n51:20.560 --> 51:25.560\nI wonder why Barbara Bush... I don't know.\n\n51:25.560 --> 51:30.560\nTake the day.\n\n51:30.560 --> 51:33.560\nThat's really good.\n\n51:33.560 --> 51:35.560\nThat's really good.\n\n51:35.560 --> 51:39.560\nBefore you said a single word, it was like an amazing impression.\n\n51:39.560 --> 51:41.560\nIt got a little Irish and then I had to abort it.\n\n51:41.560 --> 51:45.560\nIt's a gold thwait impression of Robin Williams, which is impeccable.\n\n51:45.560 --> 51:47.560\nThey hang out every day for the last 20 years.\n\n51:47.560 --> 51:49.560\nBobcat.\n\n51:49.560 --> 51:51.560\nYou can't tell...\n\n51:55.560 --> 51:57.560\nAre you friends with Bobcat?\n\n51:57.560 --> 52:01.560\nHe has done Jeff's job here before when Jeff's been away.\n\n52:01.560 --> 52:05.560\nWe actually had Bob and Robin on the same show here.\n\n52:05.560 --> 52:09.560\nHe brought Robin by unexpectedly one night.\n\n52:09.560 --> 52:11.560\nHe's so funny.\n\n52:11.560 --> 52:13.560\nI remember telling me years ago, I haven't seen him in 100 years,\n\n52:13.560 --> 52:15.560\nbut he had just done...\n\n52:15.560 --> 52:17.560\nAre we talking about Bob or Robin?\n\n52:17.560 --> 52:19.560\nYeah, Bob.\n\n52:19.560 --> 52:21.560\nJake's the clown.\n\n52:21.560 --> 52:25.560\nSomeone said, oh, you guys thought it was Robin Williams.\n\n52:25.560 --> 52:27.560\nThey both did clown movies.\n\n52:27.560 --> 52:29.560\nYeah, they did.\n\n52:29.560 --> 52:31.560\nVery different tones.\n\n52:31.560 --> 52:35.560\nYeah, and Luanda Page, she had a line that was like,\n\n52:35.560 --> 52:40.560\nwhat are you doing here? And she came up with, I got that peanut butter pussy.\n\n52:40.560 --> 52:43.560\nIt's smooth and brown and easy to spread.\n\n52:43.560 --> 52:47.560\nAnd Bobcat said, okay, we have one that way.\n\n52:53.560 --> 52:55.560\nI won Bobcat.\n\n52:55.560 --> 52:57.560\nHe is amazing.\n\n52:57.560 --> 52:59.560\nAnd another hero of mine in terms of realizing,\n\n52:59.560 --> 53:01.560\nthat was back in Milwaukee, Bob.\n\n53:01.560 --> 53:03.560\nI told him when he came here,\n\n53:03.560 --> 53:05.560\nSchrab and I, when we were in Milwaukee,\n\n53:05.560 --> 53:09.560\nas just virtual children by today's standards,\n\n53:09.560 --> 53:15.560\nwatching Bob do stand up and watching him kind of just untethered.\n\n53:15.560 --> 53:17.560\nYeah.\n\n53:17.560 --> 53:19.560\nHe's on the audience's side,\n\n53:19.560 --> 53:21.560\nbut he also doesn't even pander to his own audience.\n\n53:21.560 --> 53:23.560\nOn the audience's side,\n\n53:23.560 --> 53:27.560\nbut absolutely not accountable to them at all.\n\n53:27.560 --> 53:31.560\nOn their side, because he expects better of them.\n\n53:31.560 --> 53:33.560\nAnd to the extent that they disappointed him,\n\n53:33.560 --> 53:35.560\nhe let them know.\n\n53:35.560 --> 53:39.560\nAnd it was really gratifying and liberating to watch\n\n53:39.560 --> 53:43.560\nthe realization that performance didn't always mean pandering.\n\n53:43.560 --> 53:47.560\nYou have equal amounts of epiphanies about how it actually is pandering.\n\n53:47.560 --> 53:49.560\nWhat the fuck are you even doing this for,\n\n53:49.560 --> 53:51.560\nif you're going to be a jaded piece of shit?\n\n53:51.560 --> 53:53.560\nThere are lots of epiphanies in that area,\n\n53:53.560 --> 53:57.560\nbut there are a lot of people who set you free, too, along the way,\n\n53:57.560 --> 53:59.560\nand send you the message of, holy shit,\n\n53:59.560 --> 54:01.560\nto do this for yourself because no one wants to watch you.\n\n54:01.560 --> 54:03.560\nYeah, I worked with Chris Guest on something,\n\n54:03.560 --> 54:07.560\nwhich, you know, another, like such an important guy in comedy,\n\n54:07.560 --> 54:09.560\nand such a, like Bobcat,\n\n54:09.560 --> 54:13.560\nand he maintains that he does not care if his audience likes the show,\n\n54:13.560 --> 54:15.560\nor likes his movie.\n\n54:15.560 --> 54:17.560\nChristopher Guest.\n\n54:17.560 --> 54:21.560\nAnd I would say to him, do you care if your wife likes it?\n\n54:21.560 --> 54:23.560\nYeah, do you care if Michael McKeon likes it?\n\n54:23.560 --> 54:25.560\nRight.\n\n54:25.560 --> 54:27.560\nYes, you're getting into an audience.\n\n54:27.560 --> 54:29.560\nYou're getting into an audience situation, Bruin.\n\n54:29.560 --> 54:31.560\nYeah, because it's a communication.\n\n54:31.560 --> 54:33.560\nThere's no doubt about it.\n\n54:33.560 --> 54:35.560\nYou're doing it for other people.\n\n54:35.560 --> 54:37.560\nThat's the weirdest.\n\n54:37.560 --> 54:39.560\nThat's the inception top spinning of,\n\n54:39.560 --> 54:41.560\nwhy would I draw on that as a metaphor?\n\n54:41.560 --> 54:43.560\nThe...\n\n54:43.560 --> 54:49.560\nBut it spins between the poles of...\n\n54:49.560 --> 54:51.560\nThey are the most important people in the world,\n\n54:51.560 --> 54:53.560\nI'm pointing at the audience,\n\n54:53.560 --> 54:55.560\nlike there's some kind of horde of plebeians.\n\n54:55.560 --> 54:58.560\nYou do everything you do for them.\n\n54:58.560 --> 55:01.560\nIf you enter the vocation that has anything to do with making them happy,\n\n55:01.560 --> 55:03.560\nthen you owe it to yourself,\n\n55:03.560 --> 55:05.560\nand owe it to them to wake up every morning and go,\n\n55:05.560 --> 55:09.560\nI would kill myself if they disappeared.\n\n55:09.560 --> 55:13.560\nI would be like, I would have no Winslow on my outcast island.\n\n55:13.560 --> 55:15.560\nI do everything I do for other people.\n\n55:15.560 --> 55:17.560\nI am a psychotic.\n\n55:17.560 --> 55:19.560\nI live to entertain.\n\n55:19.560 --> 55:21.560\nBut because I live to entertain,\n\n55:21.560 --> 55:23.560\nI also owe it to them,\n\n55:23.560 --> 55:25.560\nwhether they like it or not,\n\n55:25.560 --> 55:27.560\nto be myself and speak my mind,\n\n55:27.560 --> 55:29.560\nbecause that's what they actually are entertained by,\n\n55:29.560 --> 55:31.560\nbecause believe it or not,\n\n55:31.560 --> 55:33.560\nthey're human beings that have their own thing going on,\n\n55:33.560 --> 55:35.560\nand when they do volunteer,\n\n55:35.560 --> 55:37.560\nas we sometimes do,\n\n55:37.560 --> 55:39.560\nto sit in a chair and watch somebody else,\n\n55:39.560 --> 55:41.560\nthey don't want to watch somebody\n\n55:41.560 --> 55:43.560\nwho spent the day figuring out how to make them laugh.\n\n55:43.560 --> 55:45.560\nThey want to watch somebody who's making themselves...\n\n55:45.560 --> 55:47.560\nI think audiences,\n\n55:47.560 --> 55:49.560\nand we're audiences too,\n\n55:49.560 --> 55:51.560\nbut I think people are highly attuned to being manipulated.\n\n55:51.560 --> 55:53.560\nThere's a certain amount that they're willing to play along.\n\n55:53.560 --> 55:55.560\nI think it's why kind of self-referential stuff\n\n55:55.560 --> 55:57.560\ngot really popular for a while,\n\n55:57.560 --> 55:59.560\nbecause suddenly we were doing...\n\n55:59.560 --> 56:01.560\nEverybody was doing things like product placement\n\n56:01.560 --> 56:03.560\nand things like that.\n\n56:03.560 --> 56:05.560\nYou had to call yourself on it,\n\n56:05.560 --> 56:07.560\nbut even that's a trick.\n\n56:07.560 --> 56:09.560\nYou're flipping the pancake.\n\n56:09.560 --> 56:11.560\nIf you leave it one side down for too long,\n\n56:11.560 --> 56:13.560\nit starts to sizzle and burn.\n\n56:15.560 --> 56:17.560\nAre we any more subversive than Jack Benny?\n\n56:17.560 --> 56:19.560\nNo, we're not.\n\n56:19.560 --> 56:21.560\nAbsolutely not.\n\n56:21.560 --> 56:23.560\nIn many ways, he was being more subversive than us,\n\n56:23.560 --> 56:25.560\nbecause at least he had the balls\n\n56:25.560 --> 56:27.560\nto stop in the middle of his comedy routine\n\n56:27.560 --> 56:29.560\nand say, by the way, this is brought to you by a fucking mop.\n\n56:29.560 --> 56:31.560\nSo we don't actually\n\n56:31.560 --> 56:33.560\ngain any distance.\n\n56:33.560 --> 56:35.560\nWe change, we rotate, we flip,\n\n56:35.560 --> 56:37.560\nand we flop, and we flip, and we flop.\n\n56:37.560 --> 56:39.560\nWhat was my point?\n\n56:39.560 --> 56:41.560\nJack Benny in particular was so subversive in a way,\n\n56:41.560 --> 56:43.560\nbecause he really...\n\n56:43.560 --> 56:45.560\nHe called himself on everything.\n\n56:45.560 --> 56:47.560\nThat whole show was artifice.\n\n56:47.560 --> 56:49.560\nIf it was something that would embarrass him,\n\n56:49.560 --> 56:51.560\nhe'd kind of step away and he'd say,\n\n56:51.560 --> 56:53.560\nwell, this is just a show.\n\n56:53.560 --> 56:55.560\nHe deconstructed everything.\n\n56:55.560 --> 56:57.560\nIt's hilarious.\n\n56:57.560 --> 56:59.560\nOn satellite radio,\n\n56:59.560 --> 57:01.560\non the classic radio stuff\n\n57:01.560 --> 57:03.560\nwith Jack Benny's on, it's the greatest listing in the world.\n\n57:03.560 --> 57:05.560\nAll those guys,\n\n57:05.560 --> 57:07.560\nit'll happen to us too.\n\n57:07.560 --> 57:09.560\nIn three generations, they'll say, oh, that's right, old stuff.\n\n57:09.560 --> 57:11.560\nAnd then hopefully it'll listen to us.\n\n57:11.560 --> 57:13.560\nYou bit your ass.\n\n57:13.560 --> 57:15.560\nYou bit your ass, they'll be talking about me in 30 years.\n\n57:15.560 --> 57:17.560\nThat's what I heard.\n\n57:17.560 --> 57:19.560\nThat's what I heard Mitch Herbert say.\n\n57:19.560 --> 57:21.560\nThat was the guy.\n\n57:21.560 --> 57:23.560\nThey'll be talking about me in 30 years.\n\n57:23.560 --> 57:25.560\nI said that wrong.\n\n57:25.560 --> 57:27.560\nI'm so sorry, guys.\n\n57:27.560 --> 57:29.560\nThe guy that actually got hung for hate crimes.\n\n57:29.560 --> 57:31.560\nThat guy.\n\n57:31.560 --> 57:33.560\nYou brought the gallows.\n\n57:33.560 --> 57:35.560\nDo you know he was a showrunner before all his crimes?\n\n57:35.560 --> 57:37.560\nNo, I heard it.\n\n57:37.560 --> 57:39.560\nWhat's the show?\n\n57:39.560 --> 57:41.560\nI can't remember what it was called.\n\n57:41.560 --> 57:43.560\nWhat's the show?\n\n57:43.560 --> 57:45.560\nNobody up here to leave.\n\n57:45.560 --> 57:47.560\nNobody's leaving, even though it's going to get physically awkward\n\n57:47.560 --> 57:49.560\nand

He just can't do it.\n\n01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:19.560\nI feel like Merlin and Gandalf are probably pretty reclusive,\n\n01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:21.560\nbut those are people...\n\n01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:23.560\nThose are wizards.\n\n01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:25.560\nBut they're also in all those movies.\n\n01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:27.560\nYeah.

--> 01:06:39.560\nI was busting Dan\n\n01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:41.560\nwith my impression of Dan\n\n01:06:41.560 --> 01:06:43.560\njumping in.\n\n01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:49.560\nI thought of it this week.\n\n01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:51.560\nThe first time I was in America,\n\n01:06:51.560 --> 01:06:53.560\nI was like really little.\n\n01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:55.560\nAnd I landed in Queens\n\n01:06:55.560 --> 01:06:57.560\nwhere my uncle was.\n\n01:06:57.560 --> 01:06:59.560\nAnd it was 6 a.m.\n\n01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:01.560\nand we couldn't sleep.\n\n01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:03.560\nIt just happened to be a Thursday morning.\n\n01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:05.560\nAnd my uncle was like, here, I want to show you something.\n\n01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:07.560\nMy first day in America,\n\n01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:09.560\nand we went down,\n\n01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:11.560\nand he showed me the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.\n\n01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:13.560\nAnd I had no idea what Thanksgiving was.\n\n01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:15.560\nAnd I thought that's what happened every day.\n\n01:07:15.560 --> 01:07:17.560\nI was like, we get up\n\n01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:19.560\nand we're fucking like, look at us go!\n\n01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:21.560\nHow old were you?\n\n01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:23.560\nI don't remember.\n\n01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:25.560\nI was probably not even like, maybe 9 or something.\n\n01:07:25.560 --> 01:07:27.560\nTo young Pakistani eyes,\n\n01:07:27.560 --> 01:07:29.560\ndid it look like they were like dragging animals\n\n01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:31.560\nand effigy down the street?\n\n01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:33.560\nJust got curious.\n\n01:07:33.560 --> 01:07:35.560\nDid it look like, oh, they hate Kermit.\n\n01:07:35.560 --> 01:07:37.560\nThey hate Garfield.\n\n01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:41.560\nI don't think they filtered everything\n\n01:07:41.560 --> 01:07:43.560\nthrough stock footage of terrorists.\n\n01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:45.560\nI don't know.\n\n01:07:45.560 --> 01:07:47.560\nHe's waiting for Mussolini.\n\n01:07:47.560 --> 01:07:49.560\nThat's the spirit of the question, dude.\n\n01:07:49.560 --> 01:07:51.560\nYou know, this Infidel Charlie Brown.\n\n01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:53.560\nYou know,\n\n01:07:53.560 --> 01:07:55.560\nI'd never used the word Infidel until I came to America.\n\n01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:57.560\nYeah.\n\n01:07:57.560 --> 01:07:59.560\nBecause we were just us.\n\n01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:07.560\nI think I've told the story,\n\n01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:09.560\nbut at that exact age,\n\n01:08:09.560 --> 01:08:11.560\neven though I was born and raised\n\n01:08:11.560 --> 01:08:13.560\nwhere the miracles happen,\n\n01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:15.560\nthat didn't stop me from watching\n\n01:08:15.560 --> 01:08:17.560\nDavid Copperfield make the Statue of Liberty disappear.\n\n01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:19.560\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:21.560\nDid I tell the story on this podcast\n\n01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:23.560\nwhere I thought\n\n01:08:23.560 --> 01:08:25.560\nI watched him make it disappear\n\n01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:27.560\nand they used to make such a to-do\n\n01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:29.560\nabout things in broadcast TV make them\n\n01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:31.560\nthat I turned off the TV and was like,\n\n01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:33.560\nhuh, it's gone.\n\n01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:35.560\nHundreds of years of history.\n\n01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:37.560\nHow about that?\n\n01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:39.560\nAnd I remember my aunt coming up\n\n01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:41.560\nand going like, what's wrong?\n\n01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:43.560\nAnd me going like, it's just\n\n01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:45.560\nDavid Copperfield made the Statue of Liberty disappear\n\n01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:47.560\nand I was like, oh, interesting.\n\n01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:49.560\nAnd I was like, no, it's just, I mean, interesting?\n\n01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:51.560\nIt's fucked up.\n\n01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:53.560\nThe French gave it to us and I was like...\n\n01:08:53.560 --> 01:08:55.560\nIt's like 9-11 to your little aunt.\n\n01:08:55.560 --> 01:08:57.560\nIt was.\n\n01:08:57.560 --> 01:08:59.560\nIt was like a peaceful 9-11.\n\n01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:01.560\nI expected that he really made it disappear\n\n01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:03.560\nfor real from the earth\n\n01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:05.560\nand was pontificating about whether or not\n\n01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:07.560\nthat was right or wrong politically.\n\n01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:09.560\nI like the idea of Osama\n\n01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:11.560\nseeing that also believing it\n\n01:09:11.560 --> 01:09:13.560\nand then trying to recruit him\n\n01:09:13.560 --> 01:09:15.560\nand then going down.\n\n01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:17.560\nMy aunt was like, turn on the TV.\n\n01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:19.560\nI think he probably brought it back.\n\n01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:21.560\nNo, I don't think so.\n\n01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:23.560\nDan, how did young you feel when the Harlem Globetrotters\n\n01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:25.560\nmade it to

in their head.\n\n01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:01.560\nI've been in Jim Belushi's basement.\n\n01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:03.560\nLet's play D&D.\n\n01:10:03.560 --> 01:10:05.560\nListen.\n\n01:10:05.560 -->
