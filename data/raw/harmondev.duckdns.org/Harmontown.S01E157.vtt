12:00.000\nthat was used to put out the original New York fire\n\n12:00.000 --> 12:03.000\nof 1830.\n\n12:03.000 --> 12:05.000\nI'm back there with Wikipedia.\n\n12:05.000 --> 12:07.000\nI know it's...\n\n12:07.000 --> 12:09.000\nNew York had the first fire.\n\n12:09.000 --> 12:11.000\nHow did that fire start?\n\n12:11.000 --> 12:13.000\nThere was a monkey...\n\n12:13.000 --> 12:16.000\nBack then, it was legal to own them as pets.\n\n12:16.000 --> 12:18.000\nAnd people would bring them,\n\n12:18.000 --> 12:20.000\nand they would just...\n\n12:20.000 --> 12:24.000\nEllis Island was actually originally called...\n\n12:24.000 --> 12:26.000\nMonkey Island.\n\n12:26.000 --> 12:28.000\nBecause it was overrun.\n\n12:28.000 --> 12:29.000\nThey were like cats.\n\n12:29.000 --> 12:32.000\nYou ever go to a restaurant in Miami?\n\n12:32.000 --> 12:36.000\nThat many cats.\n\n12:36.000 --> 12:41.000\nThey were the cats of their time.\n\n12:41.000 --> 12:43.000\nThat many monkeys?\n\n12:43.000 --> 12:45.000\nIt was a Miami cat level.\n\n12:45.000 --> 12:49.000\nPeople didn't know how to spay or neuter them.\n\n12:49.000 --> 12:51.000\nWe didn't know where to start.\n\n12:51.000 --> 12:55.000\nBecause we would look for their privates,\n\n12:55.000 --> 12:57.000\nand we would just see monkey things,\n\n12:57.000 --> 12:59.000\nand we didn't know...\n\n12:59.000 --> 13:02.000\nWe could find a dog penis and a cat penis,\n\n13:02.000 --> 13:07.000\nbut when we looked at monkeys, there was a problem.\n\n13:07.000 --> 13:09.000\nBecause I don't know why.\n\n13:09.000 --> 13:11.000\nIt seems like that would be the opposite.\n\n13:11.000 --> 13:13.000\nYou'd think you would go,\n\n13:13.000 --> 13:15.000\nand I know what I'm looking for.\n\n13:15.000 --> 13:17.000\nI think that's why, because we were looking for something\n\n13:17.000 --> 13:20.000\nthat looked like a human penis, but monkified.\n\n13:20.000 --> 13:22.000\nAnd instead, we saw...\n\n13:22.000 --> 13:24.000\nYou know what a monkey penis looks like?\n\n13:24.000 --> 13:26.000\nIt's a gnarled little...\n\n13:26.000 --> 13:28.000\nIt looks like a claw.\n\n13:28.000 --> 13:31.000\nIt looks like a raptor claw.\n\n13:31.000 --> 13:33.000\nSo how did the fire start?\n\n13:38.000 --> 13:42.000\nMonkey penises are covered with...\n\n13:42.000 --> 13:45.000\nI think you pronounce it like a mollusk shell,\n\n13:45.000 --> 13:47.000\nor a rhino horn.\n\n13:47.000 --> 13:51.000\nThey're very compacted, and they're hard as glass.\n\n13:51.000 --> 13:53.000\nThey have the texture of glass.\n\n13:53.000 --> 14:00.000\nThey're white, and they curve and taper to a very sharp point.\n\n14:00.000 --> 14:04.000\nSo we thought that was like a fin or a knife.\n\n14:04.000 --> 14:09.000\nSo for a long time, you couldn't swing a cat, ironically,\n\n14:09.000 --> 14:11.000\nin New York...\n\n14:11.000 --> 14:13.000\nWithout hitting a monkey.\n\n14:13.000 --> 14:16.000\nAnd so we was one of them.\n\n14:16.000 --> 14:18.000\nThat was the fire.\n\n14:18.000 --> 14:20.000\nPolitically, it was blown out of proportion,\n\n14:20.000 --> 14:23.000\nbecause there was an anti-monkey sentiment in New York.\n\n14:23.000 --> 14:25.000\nWas this Tammany Hall back in the old days?\n\n14:25.000 --> 14:27.000\nIt was Old Boss Tweed, yeah.\n\n14:27.000 --> 14:30.000\nWas mayor of New York, and he...\n\n14:30.000 --> 14:35.000\nYeah, they called him the sugar boys.\n\n14:35.000 --> 14:38.000\nThere's political cartoons where it's Boss Tweed\n\n14:38.000 --> 14:41.000\nhas got a sash that says mayor, but then he's in front of a trough\n\n14:41.000 --> 14:46.000\nthat says Israel, and...\n\n14:46.000 --> 14:48.000\nAnd then there's sugar...\n\n14:48.000 --> 14:52.000\nBut the bags of sugar, for some reason...\n\n14:52.000 --> 14:54.000\nHe was in late with the monkeys?\n\n14:54.000 --> 14:56.000\nBoss Tweed was?\n\n14:56.000 --> 14:58.000\nYeah, because it was all like...\n\n14:58.000 --> 15:03.000\nIf monkeys were around, then they shit everywhere,\n\n15:03.000 --> 15:05.000\nand then it was all the municipal...\n\n15:05.000 --> 15:09.000\nBack then, municipal government was just...\n\n15:09.000 --> 15:12.000\nIt was just your standard monkey grift.\n\n15:12.000 --> 15:14.000\nIt was just...\n\n15:14.000 --> 15:16.000\nSomeone's got to clean this up.\n\n15:16.000 --> 15:18.000\nAnd I was like, oh, I'll do it,\n\n15:18.000 --> 15:21.000\nand it's fucking Boss Tweed in a costume.\n\n15:21.000 --> 15:22.000\nI was like, I got it.\n\n15:22.000 --> 15:24.000\nOh, this is hard. I should have overtime.\n\n15:24.000 --> 15:26.000\nYou can have it, because there was no...\n\n15:26.000 --> 15:28.000\nAll of this was happening on the radio,\n\n15:28.000 --> 15:31.000\nso no one could see that it's the same guy.\n\n15:31.000 --> 15:33.000\nAnd if you said stuff like,\n\n15:33.000 --> 15:35.000\nthis is literally the same guy that'd go,\n\n15:35.000 --> 15:36.000\nwhat are you, an anarchist?\n\n15:36.000 --> 15:38.000\nAre you like Sacco and Vanzetti?\n\n15:38.000 --> 15:42.000\nYou could get exterminated for saying that stuff back then.\n\n15:42.000 --> 15:45.000\nSo how did the fire start?\n\n15:45.000 --> 15:48.000\nThe legend is...\n\n15:48.000 --> 15:50.000\nA legend or is it news?\n\n15:50.000 --> 15:52.000\nThat's the thing is that it was all...\n\n15:52.000 --> 15:53.000\nThe truth is...\n\n15:53.000 --> 15:56.000\nThis was a great New York fire of 1921 or three.\n\n15:56.000 --> 15:57.000\nWhat was it?\n\n15:57.000 --> 15:59.000\n18.\n\n15:59.000 --> 16:02.000\n18.\n\n16:02.000 --> 16:04.000\nThe truth is...\n\n16:04.000 --> 16:05.000\nIt's all right.\n\n16:05.000 --> 16:07.000\nThe absolute truth is...\n\n16:07.000 --> 16:08.000\nThat was before Miami.\n\n16:08.000 --> 16:09.000\nI looked it up on Snopes.\n\n16:09.000 --> 16:18.000\nThe actual fact is it was Native Americans started the fire.\n\n16:18.000 --> 16:23.000\nThat's not a popular thing to say in 18.\n\n16:23.000 --> 16:33.000\nThere were still Native American cab drivers and...\n\n16:33.000 --> 16:34.000\nEven back in 1818?\n\n16:34.000 --> 16:35.000\nYeah.\n\n16:35.000 --> 16:37.000\nManhattan is a Native American word.\n\n16:37.000 --> 16:38.000\nThat means...\n\n16:38.000 --> 16:40.000\nCity of the Indians.\n\n16:40.000 --> 16:42.000\nIt was there...\n\n16:42.000 --> 16:44.000\nWe discovered Manhattan.\n\n16:44.000 --> 16:47.000\nIt's like the emerald city for them was...\n\n16:47.000 --> 16:50.000\nNow we fucking killed them and don't care.\n\n16:50.000 --> 16:53.000\nI care about them.\n\n16:53.000 --> 16:55.000\nI'm saying I don't care.\n\n16:55.000 --> 16:56.000\nYo.\n\n16:56.000 --> 16:57.000\nYo.\n\n16:57.000 --> 16:58.000\nYo.\n\n16:58.000 --> 16:59.000\nYo.\n\n16:59.000 --> 17:00.000\nYo.\n\n17:00.000 --> 17:01.000\nYo.\n\n17:01.000 --> 17:03.000\nHow could we do to them?\n\n17:03.000 --> 17:05.000\nHow could we have been back then?\n\n17:05.000 --> 17:07.000\nWe were the savages.\n\n17:07.000 --> 17:08.000\nWe were the monsters.\n\n17:08.000 --> 17:10.000\nRed skin, white skin.\n\n17:10.000 --> 17:12.000\nWhat's the difference when you put a bullet down?\n\n17:12.000 --> 17:14.000\nYou're gonna get some gibbons.\n\n17:14.000 --> 17:16.000\nThey're like monkeys that come from Alaska.\n\n17:16.000 --> 17:18.000\nYou put them in a boat.\n\n17:18.000 --> 17:22.000\nDon't ask me what to do about that.\n\n17:22.000 --> 17:24.000\nHave you noticed I've got really bad at rap?\n\n17:24.000 --> 17:28.000\nIn the last five episodes of podcast...\n\n17:28.000 --> 17:30.000\nNew York used to have more cats.\n\n17:30.000 --> 17:33.000\nRap a tap, tap, tap.\n\n17:33.000 --> 17:34.000\nYo.\n\n17:34.000 --> 17:37.000\nYo.\n\n17:37.000 --> 17:38.000\nOkay, come on.\n\n17:38.000 --> 17:41.000\nLet's stop fucking around.\n\n17:41.000 --> 17:42.000\nThis whole thing is like...\n\n17:42.000 --> 17:44.000\nThere's people here that haven't seen the show and they're like,\n\n17:44.000 --> 17:45.000\nthis is the show?\n\n17:45.000 --> 17:46.000\nNo, it's not the show.\n\n17:46.000 --> 17:47.000\nWhat happened to your rap?\n\n17:47.000 --> 17:49.000\nMy show is an examination of the...\n\n17:49.000 --> 17:50.000\nDan, Dan.\n\n17:50.000 --> 17:52.000\nI'm sorry to interrupt.\n\n17:52.000 --> 17:54.000\nWhy is your rap suffering lately?\n\n17:54.000 --> 17:57.000\nYou used to be so good at it.\n\n18:03.000 --> 18:05.000\nDon't give me Jack Benny arms.\n\n18:05.000 --> 18:08.000\nDon't ratchester me.\n\n18:08.000 --> 18:13.000\nI will tell you the truth and I can tell you from your sarcasm\n\n18:13.000 --> 18:15.000\nthat you won't agree with this\n\n18:15.000 --> 18:17.000\nand that you'll probably be amused by it\n\n18:17.000 --> 18:19.000\nthat I'm telling you the honest truth of my theory\n\n18:19.000 --> 18:20.000\nto answer your honest question.\n\n18:20.000 --> 18:23.000\nWhat is our show if not dealing with the honest truth?\n\n18:23.000 --> 18:25.000\nMy actual honest answer to your question\n\n18:25.000 --> 18:27.000\nfor which I will be punished.\n\n18:27.000 --> 18:28.000\nNot by me.\n\n18:28.000 --> 18:32.000\nWell, I don't think so.\n\n18:32.000 --> 18:34.000\nBecause you were sarcastic.\n\n18:34.000 --> 18:37.000\nThere's a bubble of insincerity around you.\n\n18:37.000 --> 18:38.000\nNo, stop!\n\n18:38.000 --> 18:40.000\nThere's a bubble of sincerity around me.\n\n18:40.000 --> 18:42.000\nI'm going to tell you the honest answer.\n\n18:42.000 --> 18:44.000\nWhy is your rap suffering?\n\n18:44.000 --> 18:47.000\nThe honest answer is because I feel too confident\n\n18:47.000 --> 18:48.000\nand comfortable doing it\n\n18:48.000 --> 18:51.000\nbecause I've done too many great raps.\n\n18:51.000 --> 18:54.000\nSee?\n\n18:54.000 --> 18:55.000\nAnd there's no...\n\n18:55.000 --> 18:56.000\nThere's nothing...\n\n18:56.000 --> 18:57.000\nThere's no...\n\n18:57.000 --> 18:58.000\nThere's no anxiousness.\n\n18:58.000 --> 19:00.000\nIs there a client here?\n\n19:00.000 --> 19:03.000\nIt's an art form from the streets.\n\n19:03.000 --> 19:06.000\nThe streets are an anxious, nervous place.\n\n19:06.000 --> 19:11.000\nYou have to be feral and skittish to rap really well.\n\n19:11.000 --> 19:13.000\nYou have to feel like if this rap doesn't work\n\n19:13.000 --> 19:15.000\nI might not have supper tonight.\n\n19:15.000 --> 19:17.000\nI have to rap for my supper.\n\n19:17.000 --> 19:19.000\nI don't have to rap for my supper.\n\n19:19.000 --> 19:22.000\nI can walk in here, lay a shit beat down.\n\n19:22.000 --> 19:24.000\nThat beats that shit.\n\n19:24.000 --> 19:26.000\nWhoever made that for free, please don't...\n\n19:26.000 --> 19:28.000\nThat was by Joey Woodward.\n\n19:28.000 --> 19:30.000\nI can drop the opposite of science.\n\n19:30.000 --> 19:33.000\nI can drop social studies.\n\n19:33.000 --> 19:35.000\nAre you saying that...\n\n19:35.000 --> 19:37.000\nI can drop Jim.\n\n19:37.000 --> 19:39.000\nI don't have to drop Mad...\n\n19:39.000 --> 19:41.000\nI don't have to drop Mad Science anymore.\n\n19:41.000 --> 19:43.000\nI can drop Happy Jim.\n\n19:43.000 --> 19:45.000\nThe opposite of Mad Science.\n\n19:45.000 --> 19:47.000\nYou're saying you're so comfortable with rap\n\n19:47.000 --> 19:49.000\nthat you're not good anymore at it?\n\n19:49.000 --> 19:51.000\nYou've become too complacent?\n\n19:51.000 --> 19:53.000\nYes, yes, yes.\n\n19:53.000 --> 19:55.000\nHow do we shake you out of that complacency\n\n19:55.000 --> 19:57.000\nand get you back into that raw, feral mode?\n\n19:57.000 --> 19:59.000\nWell, not by telling me I'm bad at it.\n\n19:59.000 --> 20:01.000\nI didn't tell you...\n\n20:01.000 --> 20:03.000\nYou said backstage...\n\n20:03.000 --> 20:05.000\nYou told me backstage...\n\n20:05.000 --> 20:08.000\nI've lost my mojo with the rapping.\n\n20:08.000 --> 20:11.000\nDon't you think we've rapped too much already?\n\n20:11.000 --> 20:13.000\nJust try as an experiment.\n\n20:13.000 --> 20:15.000\nJust play a really, really, really fast...\n\n20:15.000 --> 20:17.000\nWhat's your fastest beat?\n\n20:17.000 --> 20:19.000\nI just got to be off balance.\n\n20:19.000 --> 20:22.000\nI have to stop owning the art of rapping so much.\n\n20:22.000 --> 20:26.000\nI have to remember what it's like to be a guest in rap.\n\n20:26.000 --> 20:30.000\nYo, yo, empty, empty, empty head, empty head.\n\n20:30.000 --> 20:33.000\nYo, yo, rapping, rapping.\n\n20:33.000 --> 20:37.000\nYo, yo, yo, my microphone's a weapon.\n\n20:37.000 -->

24:53.000\nBut first, let's...\n\n24:53.000 --> 24:55.000\nWe forgot to bring up Spencer.\n\n24:55.000 --> 24:59.000\nSpencer!\n\n24:59.000 --> 25:04.000\nYo, yo, yo.\n\n25:04.000 --> 25:08.000\nYo,

is now, like, loaded.\n\n25:21.000 --> 25:22.000\nIt's lock, stock, and barrel.\n\n25:22.000 --> 25:23.000\nAll right, let me have it.\n\n25:23.000 --> 25:24.000\nBarrel?\n\n25:24.000 --> 25:26.000\nSpencer laid on his New York.\n\n25:26.000 --> 25:27.000\nWhat do you think?\n\n25:27.000 --> 25:33.000\nI think the buildings, they're going to fall apart.\n\n25:33.000 --> 25:35.000\nIn California, there's earthquakes.\n\n25:35.000 --> 25:36.000\nThe building codes are really higher,\n\n25:36.000 --> 25:38.000\nand it makes me really nervous\n\n25:38.000 --> 25:42.000\nwhen I'm not around those California-secured buildings.\n\n25:42.000 --> 25:43.000\nNo offense.\n\n25:43.000 --> 25:47.000\nNot any of your faults, probably.\n\n25:47.000 --> 25:49.000\nSo when you walk around these buildings\n\n25:49.000 --> 25:51.000\nthat have been here for a long, long time,\n\n25:51.000 --> 25:53.000\nyou feel like they might crumble at any moment?\n\n25:53.000 --> 25:56.000\nYeah, I mean, you know how many, like, cars\n\n25:56.000 --> 25:58.000\nor, like, trucks or, like, Kool-Aid Man\n\n25:58.000 --> 26:01.000\ncan, like, burst through a brick wall?\n\n26:01.000 --> 26:03.000\nJust take out a city block.\n\n26:03.000 --> 26:07.000\nDo you feel that L.A. is more Kool-Aid Man secure?\n\n26:07.000 --> 26:11.000\nYou know how you never see Kool-Aid Man in L.A.?\n\n26:11.000 --> 26:15.000\nThey don't set out to prevent Kool-Aid Man-ery,\n\n26:15.000 --> 26:18.000\nbut by making a building earthquake-proof,\n\n26:18.000 --> 26:21.000\nlike, Kool-Aid Man bounces off of those things.\n\n26:21.000 --> 26:22.000\nHe walks into the front door.\n\n26:22.000 --> 26:24.000\nYou know what his catchphrase is in L.A.?\n\n26:24.000 --> 26:25.000\nWhat?\n\n26:25.000 --> 26:27.000\nOh, no.\n\n26:27.000 --> 26:28.000\nIs that right?\n\n26:28.000 --> 26:29.000\nYeah.\n\n26:29.000 --> 26:31.000\nThe Kool-Aid Man has to change his catchphrase\n\n26:31.000 --> 26:33.000\nwhen he's in L.A.\n\n26:33.000 --> 26:36.000\nThere are no Kool-Aid commercials anymore.\n\n26:36.000 --> 26:38.000\nThey're just, like, they're being so nice.\n\n26:38.000 --> 26:40.000\nThey're like, I'm sure I'll look it up later,\n\n26:40.000 --> 26:42.000\nI'm sure there's such a thing as a Kool-Aid Man,\n\n26:42.000 --> 26:45.000\nand I'm sure he, I'm sure, like,\n\n26:45.000 --> 26:46.000\nmaybe his catchphrase was, oh, yes.\n\n26:46.000 --> 26:48.000\nGo on YouTube and look up what we're talking about.\n\n26:48.000 --> 26:50.000\nKool-Aid Man used to, he was kind of a terrorist.\n\n26:50.000 --> 26:54.000\nHe would, there would be thirsty children at a party,\n\n26:54.000 --> 26:57.000\nand they'd go, I'm thirsty, and a giant terrorist\n\n26:57.000 --> 26:59.000\nwould burst through the wall.\n\n26:59.000 --> 27:02.000\nIt was a man, it wasn't a man, it was a monster.\n\n27:02.000 --> 27:06.000\nIt was an anthropomorphic jug, a jar of, a jug,\n\n27:06.000 --> 27:09.000\na pitcher, an anthropomorphic pitcher of Kool-Aid\n\n27:09.000 --> 27:11.000\nwith a face on it.\n\n27:11.000 --> 27:13.000\nI think the kids know.\n\n27:13.000 --> 27:15.000\nThere's been Family Guy episodes about this.\n\n27:15.000 --> 27:16.000\nOh, okay, Family Guy.\n\n27:16.000 --> 27:18.000\nAll right, go watch Family Guy\n\n27:18.000 --> 27:20.000\nso you can understand my comedy.\n\n27:20.000 --> 27:24.000\nI wanted to throw the drink down,\n\n27:24.000 --> 27:26.000\nbut then I was like, I'd be, I'd just say it.\n\n27:26.000 --> 27:28.000\nSay the word, Dan.\n\n27:28.000 --> 27:30.000\nSay the word.\n\n27:30.000 --> 27:32.000\nI'm not gonna say your hate-filled word.\n\n27:32.000 --> 27:35.000\nI'm on, I'm on that absinthe right now.\n\n27:35.000 --> 27:37.000\nOh, you drank, did you drink some of,\n\n27:37.000 --> 27:39.000\nsome of Jane's absinthe?\n\n27:39.000 --> 27:43.000\nI might have drank more than other people who drank it.\n\n27:43.000 --> 27:44.000\nYeah.\n\n27:44.000 --> 27:46.000\nOur friend, is it cooked, Jane Cook?\n\n27:46.000 --> 27:47.000\nYeah.\n\n27:47.000 --> 27:50.000\nIt makes, it's so close to Dane Cook that she...\n\n27:50.000 --> 27:53.000\nAnd Dane Cook did a bit about the Kool-Aid man.\n\n27:53.000 --> 27:56.000\nHe doesn't like it when juice wears tights.\n\n27:56.000 --> 28:01.000\nYeah, from that album in like 19, I don't know.\n\n28:01.000 --> 28:04.000\nSo I'm treading in safe water, that's what we're saying.\n\n28:04.000 --> 28:08.000\nYou took it in a whole new left field direction.\n\n28:08.000 --> 28:10.000\nHis catchphrase is, oh no, in LA.\n\n28:10.000 --> 28:13.000\nWhen you're at a party as a kid in LA and you go,\n\n28:13.000 --> 28:17.000\nI'm thirsty, sometimes you'll hear a thud.\n\n28:17.000 --> 28:22.000\nAnd then like a crack of glass, the shattering of glass.\n\n28:22.000 --> 28:26.000\nAnd someone saying, oh no.\n\n28:26.000 --> 28:30.000\nAnd that's how you know that you should buy Kool-Aid.\n\n28:30.000 --> 28:35.000\nBecause remember, the commercials aren't for architecture.\n\n28:35.000 --> 28:36.000\nNo.\n\n28:36.000 --> 28:38.000\nIf they were, the Kool-Aid corporation would be like,\n\n28:38.000 --> 28:41.000\nlet's not air this, but there are LA commercials\n\n28:41.000 --> 28:43.000\nwhere you hear the thud and you hear, oh no.\n\n28:43.000 --> 28:45.000\nAnd they say, look, it's still fucking delicious.\n\n28:45.000 --> 28:50.000\nYou just can't get into your house unless you invite him in.\n\n28:50.000 --> 28:52.000\nHe's like a vampire.\n\n28:52.000 --> 28:54.000\nYeah, let the right Kool-Aid jug in.\n\n28:54.000 --> 28:57.000\nExcept unlike a vampire, when you do invite him in,\n\n28:57.000 --> 29:00.000\nthen he goes, I'm trying, I can't fit.\n\n29:00.000 --> 29:02.000\nWhy do you think I come through the wall?\n\n29:02.000 --> 29:03.000\nCover on the back.\n\n29:03.000 --> 29:05.000\nWe have a backyard.\n\n29:05.000 --> 29:10.000\nWe have a, like, we have to have my birthday party\n\n29:10.000 --> 29:14.000\nat a stadium with a dome so that you can hear, oh yeah,\n\n29:14.000 --> 29:16.000\nand he's dropped it.\n\n29:16.000 --> 29:17.000\nDumb.\n\n29:17.000 --> 29:18.000\nI got excited.\n\n29:18.000 --> 29:19.000\nI got stuttered.\n\n29:19.000 --> 29:20.000\nAnd I was like, why did he stutter for that?\n\n29:20.000 --> 29:21.000\nWhy did that make him excited?\n\n29:21.000 --> 29:25.000\nDid he think it was going to be neat to what he said?\n\n29:25.000 --> 29:28.000\nHoney, what do you think causes Dan stutter?\n\n29:28.000 --> 29:32.000\nI think it seems like when he gets really excited about what\n\n29:32.000 --> 29:35.000\nhe's going to say next, why would he be excited about that\n\n29:35.000 --> 29:38.000\nstadium thing?\n\n29:38.000 --> 29:40.000\nWell, he doesn't always know, sweetie.\n\n29:40.000 --> 29:42.000\nIt's not a written show.\n\n29:42.000 --> 29:44.000\nHe's not a proud person.\n\n29:44.000 --> 29:48.000\nThe show's not called Dan Harmon's Proud of Himself.\n\n29:48.000 --> 29:51.000\nAnd even if it was, the content of the show doesn't need\n\n29:51.000 --> 29:54.000\nto prove the title right.\n\n29:54.000 --> 30:02.000\nThere's no bondage in family ties.\n\n30:02.000 --> 30:06.000\nKnight Rider doesn't wear armor and they doesn't exist.\n\n30:06.000 --> 30:12.000\nThere's nobody named Knight Rider in that show.\n\n30:12.000 --> 30:13.000\nThere's a guy named Knight.\n\n30:13.000 --> 30:14.000\nThe car's name is Kit.\n\n30:14.000 --> 30:16.000\nLook it up.\n\n30:16.000 --> 30:17.000\nThis is all New York shit.\n\n30:17.000 --> 30:19.000\nYou should be into this.\n\n30:19.000 --> 30:21.000\nIt should

go home.\n\n30:34.000 --> 30:35.000\nYou hear till Thursday?\n\n30:35.000 --> 30:36.000\nI think.\n\n30:36.000 --> 30:37.000\nI don't know.\n\n30:37.000 --> 30:38.000\nAll right.\n\n30:38.000 --> 30:39.000\nWell, we're being rude to our guest.\n\n30:39.000 --> 30:40.000\nSo here's the thing.\n\n30:40.000 --> 30:44.000\nIn introducing this, our friend, I want to explain to you why\n\n30:44.000 --> 30:45.000\nI'm here.\n\n30:45.000 --> 30:46.000\nIt's for UNICEF.\n\n30:46.000 --> 30:48.000\nThere's a basket being passed.\n\n30:48.000 --> 30:54.000\nReal funny, they're crippled.\n\n30:54.000 --> 30:59.000\nGreat.\n\n30:59.000 --> 31:03.000\nYo, yo, yo, yo.\n\n31:03.000 --> 31:08.000\nUNICEF.\n\n31:08.000 --> 31:11.000\nThey need your money real bad because some people are born\n\n31:11.000 --> 31:13.000\nwith the chances you didn't have.\n\n31:13.000 --> 31:16.000\nYou were born with two arms.\n\n31:16.000 --> 31:17.000\nSome people weren't.\n\n31:17.000 --> 31:19.000\nGive them money.\n\n31:19.000 --> 31:24.000\nIs that what UNICEF is?\n\n31:24.000 --> 31:26.000\nUNICEF needs better PR.\n\n31:26.000 --> 31:32.000\nSo give them money and you can know who they are.\n\n31:32.000 --> 31:36.000\nYeah, yeah.\n\n31:36.000 --> 31:37.000\nYeah.\n\n31:37.000 --> 31:39.000\nPlease help UNICEF tonight.\n\n31:39.000 --> 31:41.000\nWe've forgotten what they are.\n\n31:41.000 --> 31:45.000\nAnd that is a terrible life for a charity.\n\n31:45.000 --> 31:49.000\nUNICEF needs your help before it can go back to helping people.\n\n31:49.000 --> 31:51.000\nHelp them brand themselves.\n\n31:51.000 --> 31:52.000\nYeah.\n\n31:52.000 --> 31:53.000\nYeah.\n\n31:53.000 --> 31:54.000\nI mean, March of Dimes, who could forget them?\n\n31:54.000 --> 31:56.000\nI mean, it's like, wow.\n\n31:56.000 --> 31:57.000\nDimes.\n\n31:57.000 --> 31:59.000\nThose are obviously the people that...\n\n31:59.000 --> 32:00.000\nWhat does March of Dimes do?\n\n32:00.000 --> 32:02.000\nWhat does March of Dimes do?\n\n32:02.000 --> 32:05.000\nWell, I mean, doesn't that sound like a fucking horrible\n\n32:05.000 --> 32:07.000\nhorror premise, the March of Dimes?\n\n32:07.000 --> 32:10.000\nI always, it always scared me when I would hear that.\n\n32:10.000 --> 32:11.000\nLike, I'm sorry.\n\n32:11.000 --> 32:13.000\nDon't forget March of Dimes is coming.\n\n32:13.000 --> 32:15.000\nWhy is that... Why is it scary?\n\n32:15.000 --> 32:17.000\nThe March of Anything is scary.\n\n32:17.000 --> 32:18.000\nOkay.\n\n32:18.000 --> 32:22.000\nBut Dimes are so small.\n\n32:22.000 --> 32:24.000\nYeah, but it's like, it's not like...\n\n32:24.000 --> 32:26.000\nIt's like the March of Souls.\n\n32:26.000 --> 32:27.000\nLike, it's not... The things aren't March of...\n\n32:27.000 --> 32:28.000\nThe Souls are terrifying.\n\n32:28.000 --> 32:30.000\nIt's the March...\n\n32:30.000 --> 32:31.000\nBut the thing that's...\n\n32:31.000 --> 32:33.000\nThe March of is not the thing that's marching.\n\n32:33.000 --> 32:35.000\nRight, right, okay.\n\n32:35.000 --> 32:42.000\nThe March of Genocide is Nazis.\n\n32:42.000 --> 32:44.000\nThe March of Dimes is like...\n\n32:44.000 --> 32:46.000\nI don't know what's coming, but it wants your dimes.\n\n32:46.000 --> 32:49.000\nAnd I haven't had any since 1968.\n\n32:49.000 --> 32:52.000\nIt's worse than a penny because it's smaller.\n\n32:52.000 --> 32:56.000\nAnd there's a guy on it that looks like...\n\n32:56.000 --> 32:58.000\nWho's on the dime, Dan?\n\n32:58.000 --> 32:59.000\nThe dime...\n\n32:59.000 --> 33:01.000\nIt's Michael Chiklis is on the dime.\n\n33:01.000 --> 33:03.000\nIf you really look at it...\n\n33:03.000 --> 33:07.000\nFrom my memory, I haven't looked at a dime since\n\n33:07.000 --> 33:10.000\nbefore I heard of Michael Chiklis, but based on...\n\n33:10.000 --> 33:13.000\nI'm remembering Michael Chiklis on the dime.\n\n33:13.000 --> 33:16.000\nOur next guest played the thing in the first\n\n33:16.000 --> 33:21.000\nFantastic Four movie, Michael Chiklis.\n\n33:21.000 --> 33:23.000\nIf Michael Chiklis came out right now,\n\n33:23.000 --> 33:25.000\nthat would be the best segue of all time.\n\n33:25.000 --> 33:29.000\nSee if you can find Roger Corman's horrible shitty...\n\n33:29.000 --> 33:31.000\nI have to hurry up and finish making this movie\n\n33:31.000 --> 33:33.000\nor I'll lose the rights to make it.\n\n33:33.000 --> 33:36.000\nFantastic Four movie, which Michael Chiklis plays the thing.\n\n33:36.000 --> 33:40.000\nAnd because he already says it's clobbering time\n\n33:40.000 --> 33:42.000\nin the first half of the movie,\n\n33:42.000 --> 33:45.000\nhe's left with nothing else to say at the end of the movie.\n\n33:45.000 --> 33:47.000\nWhen he comes into the third act, he goes,\n\n33:47.000 --> 33:51.000\nit's clobbering time for real.\n\n33:51.000 --> 33:52.000\nIt's so sad.\n\n33:52.000 --> 33:56.000\nIt's like an alcoholic dad.\n\n33:56.000 --> 33:59.000\nWe're going to the zoo and I mean it.\n\n33:59.000 --> 34:04.000\nSorry about the last clobbering time.\n\n34:04.000 --> 34:06.000\nIt kind of got interrupted.\n\n34:06.000 --> 34:09.000\nI fell asleep.\n\n34:09.000 --> 34:14.000\nIt's the clobbering thought that counts.\n\n34:14.000 --> 34:19.000\nMy dad hit me ten times more than yours hits you.\n\n34:19.000 --> 34:23.000\nAnd that's the progress.\n\n34:23.000 --> 34:27.000\nI consider myself a pacifist compared to him.\n\n34:27.000 --> 34:28.000\nYou're welcome.\n\n34:28.000 --> 34:31.000\nSo clobbering time is terrifying for the kids.\n\n34:31.000 --> 34:36.000\nMarch of dimes.\n\n34:36.000 --> 34:37.000\nIt follows.\n\n34:37.000 --> 34:39.000\nThat's an innocuous but terrifying.\n\n34:39.000 --> 34:40.000\nIt follows.\n\n34:40.000 --> 34:41.000\nWhat follows?\n\n34:41.000 --> 34:42.000\nMarch of dimes.\n\n34:42.000 --> 34:43.000\nWhat do they want?\n\n34:43.000 --> 34:44.000\nThey want dimes.\n\n34:44.000 --> 34:47.000\nWell, but why?\n\n34:47.000 --> 34:48.000\nLike pumpkin head.\n\n34:48.000 --> 34:50.000\nThat's scary because it sounds like dumb.\n\n34:50.000 --> 34:51.000\nLike pumpkin head.\n\n34:51.000 --> 34:52.000\nOh, fuck.\n\n34:52.000 --> 34:53.000\nAll right.\n\n34:53.000 --> 34:54.000\nCome on.\n\n34:54.000 --> 34:56.000\nWe have a guest tonight.\n\n34:56.000 --> 34:59.000\nSo the reason I'm in New York is not for UNICEF.\n\n34:59.000 --> 35:04.000\nThat was all a joke.\n\n35:04.000 --> 35:09.000\nAnd a scene.\n\n35:09.000 --> 35:18.000\nAll right.\n\n35:18.000 --> 35:19.000\nYeah.\n\n35:19.000 --> 35:24.000\nTouch my hair and then say gross.\n\n35:24.000 --> 35:28.000\nSo now I'm 11 again.\n\n35:28.000 --> 35:30.000\nI just fucked you in the butt.\n\n35:30.000 --> 35:34.000\nAnd then that wasn't enough for you.\n\n35:34.000 --> 35:38.000\nThat's the greatest compliment a person can give another person is to fuck him right in\n\n35:38.000 --> 35:39.000\nthe butt.\n\n35:39.000 --> 35:40.000\nRight?\n\n35:40.000 --> 35:41.000\nYeah.\n\n35:41.000 --> 35:46.000\nRight in New York.\n\n35:46.000 --> 35:52.000\nNew York is a butt fucking town.\n\n35:52.000 --> 35:53.000\nWell, they call it.\n\n35:53.000 --> 35:57.000\nSadami is called a New York salute.\n\n35:57.000 --> 36:00.000\nI couldn't think of anything better.\n\n36:00.000 --> 36:05.000\nThe next guy could come up with something better because he's our guest and he's a professional\n\n36:05.000 --> 36:06.000\ncomedy writer.\n\n36:06.000 --> 36:07.000\nChecklist.\n\n36:07.000 --> 36:08.000\nChecklist.\n\n36:08.000 --> 36:14.000\nSo the reason I'm here in New York is because I'm shooting this thing for IFC.\n\n36:14.000 --> 36:18.000\nEver heard of it?\n\n36:18.000 --> 36:22.000\nUnlike these other basic cable networks, their name still means something.\n\n36:22.000 --> 36:27.000\nIt's a raw bone documentary about monkeys starting the fire of 1921.\n\n36:27.000 --> 36:31.000\nI mean, because when you hear the description of the pilot, you'll go, what does that have\n\n36:31.000 --> 36:33.000\nto do with independence or film?\n\n36:33.000 --> 36:38.000\nBut if you really think about it, you'll go, oh, okay.\n\n36:38.000 --> 36:42.000\nBecause the network is going to, you're going to have a new slogan, like TLC.\n\n36:42.000 --> 36:44.000\nIt's like, because they show the things.\n\n36:44.000 --> 36:46.000\nIt's like, duck, duck town.\n\n36:46.000 --> 36:47.000\nWhat is this?\n\n36:47.000 --> 36:54.000\nBut as if an apology, they go like, TLC, because you could learn about anything.\n\n36:54.000 --> 36:57.000\nIt's all animal planet.\n\n36:57.000 --> 36:58.000\nIt's very human.\n\n36:58.000 --> 37:01.000\nMeaning there's no fucking animals in that goddamn fucking channel.\n\n37:01.000 --> 37:02.000\nHumans are animals too.\n\n37:02.000 --> 37:03.000\nWhy do you apologize?\n\n37:03.000 --> 37:05.000\nMake different programming then.\n\n37:05.000 --> 37:08.000\nThere has been no arts or entertainment on A&E.\n\n37:08.000 --> 37:16.000\nChange your name to television station number nine.\n\n37:16.000 --> 37:21.000\nUp next, Breaking Bad here on AMC.\n\n37:21.000 --> 37:27.000\nWhere you're watching new classics, where's they happen?\n\n37:27.000 --> 37:29.000\nToothpaste Wars on the History Channel.\n\n37:29.000 --> 37:37.000\nBecause, hey, people might hear about this one day if you watch.\n\n37:37.000 --> 37:40.000\nSlut Night on Discovery Channel.\n\n37:40.000 --> 37:43.000\nNo disclaimer necessary.\n\n37:43.000 --> 37:46.000\nDiscovery, everything's a discovery.\n\n37:46.000 --> 37:48.000\nSlut Night.\n\n37:48.000 --> 37:53.000\nWhat happens, what do you think is going to happen on season three of Slut Night?\n\n37:53.000 --> 37:58.000\nWell, they're kicking Maggie off.\n\n37:58.000 --> 37:59.000\nNo!\n\n37:59.000 --> 38:00.000\nWe love Maggie.\n\n38:00.000 --> 38:02.000\nShe's the sluttiest one.\n\n38:02.000 --> 38:05.000\nOh yeah, you guys, New York hates Maggie, of course.\n\n38:05.000 --> 38:06.000\nWell, yeah.\n\n38:06.000 --> 38:09.000\nBut by the way, she's from Long Island.\n\n38:09.000 --> 38:14.000\nBut she says New York.\n\n38:14.000 --> 38:18.000\nAnd I'm sorry, I'm not going to win any popularity contests for saying this.\n\n38:18.000 --> 38:22.000\nBut she's no slut.\n\n38:22.000 --> 38:23.000\nThere, I said it.\n\n38:23.000 --> 38:25.000\nShe's not a slut.\n\n38:25.000 --> 38:27.000\nWe've divided the crowd on that one.\n\n38:27.000 --> 38:30.000\nShe has agency.\n\n38:30.000 --> 38:36.000\nThey edit it out.\n\n38:36.000 --> 38:39.000\nMore sluts, Discovery Channel.\n\n38:39.000 --> 38:45.000\nLess fake sluts.\n\n38:45.000 --> 38:54.000\nShe's an autonomous person with status.\n\n38:54.000 --> 38:58.000\nSo the reason I'm here is we're shooting a pilot.\n\n38:58.000 --> 39:03.000\nThey've cast me as a host and I don't think you have to ask why.\n\n39:03.000 --> 39:09.000\nBecause just look at what you've seen tonight.\n\n39:09.000 --> 39:11.000\nIs it a show about Asperger's, Dan?\n\n39:11.000 --> 39:15.000\nWhy are you...\n\n39:15.000 --> 39:18.000\nIs it a show for the blind?\n\n39:18.000 --> 39:24.000\nIs it a show in which there's names of people's...\n\n39:24.000 --> 39:29.000\npictures of people's faces on the floor so that what normally looks like someone staring\n\n39:29.000 --> 39:32.000\nat the floor while they talk?\n\n39:32.000 --> 39:37.000\nIs the new definition of a professional host?\n\n39:37.000 --> 39:43.000\nIs the show called This Week's Current Events as Flortile?\n\n39:43.000 --> 39:45.000\nHow did you get this job?\n\n39:45.000 --> 39:46.000\nI don't know.\n\n39:46.000 --> 39:48.000\nIt's a bad economy.\n\n39:48.000 --> 39:52.000\nTimes are tough and no one's watching TV anymore.\n\n39:52.000 --> 39:58.000\nIs there so much cachet in the Dan Harmon brand right now that we want you to host our show?\n\n39:58.000 --> 40:06.000\nWe're meeting in the middle, like my podcast is ganging a few listeners, TV's losing a few viewers.\n\n40:06.000 --> 40:08.000\nSo we meet in a nice happy middle.\n\n40:08.000 --> 40:09.000\nThey're like, how about you?\n\n40:09.000 --> 40:10.000\nI don't know.\n\n40:10.000 --> 40:11.000\nWe ran out of people.\n\n40:11.000 --> 40:14.000\nWho do you think they passed on right before it came to you?\n\n40:14.000 --> 40:19.000\nOne of them is our next guest, actually.\n\n40:19.000 --> 40:20.000\nFor real?\n\n40:20.000 --> 40:21.000\nYeah, I know.\n\n40:21.000 --> 40:24.000\nYou'd think we wouldn't get along, but I really like this guy.\n\n40:24.000 --> 40:26.000\nI've just been chatting with him for five minutes backstage.\n\n40:26.000 --> 40:27.000\nHe's not bitter?\n\n40:27.000 --> 40:28.000\nNo, he's not.\n\n40:28.000 --> 40:30.000\nWell, you'll find out.\n\n40:30.000 --> 40:32.000\nHe's a wonderful personality.\n\n40:32.000 --> 40:34.000\nHe's from Long Island.\n\n40:34.000 --> 40:37.000\nAre you from Long Island?\n\n40:37.000 --> 40:44.000\nWhich I kind of shit on just a second ago, but I don't know anything about it, so it doesn't matter.\n\n40:44.000 --> 40:48.000\nSo the thing that we're doing is this...\n\n40:48.000 --> 40:51.000\nWe'll talk about it with him as a way of explaining it.\n\n40:51.000 --> 40:57.000\nBecause otherwise, then I'll be like 12, and I won't have...\n\n40:57.000 --> 41:04.000\nThe title of this episode, it will be Dan introduces...\n\n41:04.000 --> 41:06.000\nAnd we never meet...\n\n41:06.000 --> 41:07.000\nSuch a good episode.\n\n41:07.000 --> 41:11.000\nHe talked about slavery.\n\n41:11.000 --> 41:14.000\nIs the IFC show going to be this riveting?\n\n41:14.000 --> 41:17.000\nIs it going to be like this kind of trenchant interviews?\n\n41:17.000 --> 41:20.000\nNope.\n\n41:20.000 --> 41:22.000\nLet's bring him out.\n\n41:22.000 --> 41:24.000\nNo, stop it.\n\n41:24.000 --> 41:27.000\nWell, if I didn't have to do a good introduction, like a good host test.\n\n41:27.000 --> 41:29.000\nOkay, let's take it from the top.\n\n41:29.000 --> 41:31.000\nDo you want music for this?\n\n41:31.000 --> 41:32.000\nNo, no, no, no, no, no, no.\n\n41:32.000 --> 41:34.000\nYeah, beat Dick Cavett, pretend you're sitting on the couch,\n\n41:34.000 --> 41:36.000\nand it's like, you know, it's groovy.\n\n41:36.000 --> 41:37.000\nIt's the 70s.\n\n41:37.000 --> 41:39.000\nYou're going to bring somebody out.\n\n41:39.000 --> 41:49.000\nFew television shows in recent memory have had as much impact on the entertainosphere.\n\n41:49.000 --> 41:53.000\nAs the deceptively named daily show.\n\n41:53.000 --> 42:01.000\nFor truly, it is a show for the century.\n\n42:01.000 --> 42:05.000\nAnd although it airs daily, there's nothing daily about it.\n\n42:05.000 --> 42:07.000\nThere's a lot of daily stuff about it.\n\n42:07.000 --> 42:09.000\nAnyways, we all love the daily show.\n\n42:09.000 --> 42:11.000\nThis guy was...\n\n42:11.000 --> 42:13.000\nLet's

42:32.000\nThey can't say that.\n\n42:32.000 --> 42:34.000\nThat makes it sound like...\n\n42:34.000 --> 42:35.000\nTake three, take three.\n\n42:35.000 --> 42:37.000\nGuest intro, take

me.\n\n44:31.000 --> 44:32.000\nHello, everybody.\n\n44:32.000 --> 44:35.000\nSo, Dan beat you out of a job to host the show.\n\n44:35.000 --> 44:36.000\nI did.\n\n44:36.000 --> 44:38.000\nI didn't even think of it that way because I would not have said yes this should.\n\n44:38.000 --> 44:40.600\nFigured out your art's name is Cy.\n\n44:40.600 --> 44:41.760\nIs that the right one?\n\n44:41.760 --> 44:45.680\nAll I heard was, well, while they were singing your praises,\n\n44:45.680 --> 44:48.400\nlike there was that much of a clause in it that was like,\n\n44:48.400 --> 44:50.440\nhe actually was going to host, or I wanted to host.\n\n44:50.440 --> 44:52.200\nAnd I was like, oh, that sounds like,\n\n44:52.200 --> 44:56.720\nthat sounds like he'll be a real Robin to my Batman.\n\n44:56.720 --> 44:57.920\nWait a minute.\n\n44:57.920 --> 44:58.880\nThat's a good thing, right?\n\n44:58.880 --> 44:59.960\nRobin, you're Batman.\n\n44:59.960 --> 45:01.880\nWell, that's the sarcasm, is that it?\n\n45:01.880 --> 45:02.880\nOh, I see the sarcasm is that word.\n\n45:02.880 --> 45:04.080\nIt's like he's going to want to murder me.\n\n45:04.080 --> 45:06.520\nThe sarcasm might be more like the Scarecrow.\n\n45:06.520 --> 45:07.000\nYeah.\n\n45:07.000 --> 45:07.800\nI got you.\n\n45:07.800 --> 45:08.200\nI'm sorry.\n\n45:08.200 --> 45:08.920\nNo, not at all.\n\n45:08.920 --> 45:10.200\nI think it's great that you're hosting.\n\n45:10.200 --> 45:11.520\nYeah, because we like each other.\n\n45:11.520 --> 45:14.320\nBecause we immediately started talking about Witcher 3\n\n45:14.320 --> 45:16.480\nand video games and role-playing.\n\n45:16.480 --> 45:17.960\nWe did, Witcher 3.\n\n45:17.960 --> 45:21.160\nWhat's up, ladies?\n\n45:21.160 --> 45:24.760\nWhen I was talking about Witcher 2, like a bunch of losers.\n\n45:24.760 --> 45:25.960\nGot the third one.\n\n45:25.960 --> 45:26.920\nYeah.\n\n45:26.920 --> 45:29.320\nIt's because we got enough money for a PS4.\n\n45:29.320 --> 45:32.320\nYeah.\n\n45:32.320 --> 45:34.880\nWait, did my mic go off, or am I just less effective?\n\n45:34.880 --> 45:35.760\nI don't hear you.\n\n45:35.760 --> 45:38.520\nI think it went off.\n\n45:38.520 --> 45:39.080\nYeah.\n\n45:39.080 --> 45:46.720\nOK, so you come from the whiplash, breakneck,\n\n45:46.720 --> 45:49.640\nthrill-a-minute world of

man.\n\n46:03.120 --> 46:05.240\nYou don't have a Pickle Dick, get off the fucking can.\n\n46:05.240 --> 46:07.240\nThat's what we say.\n\n46:07.240 --> 46:08.920\nIt's on the bumper sticker, guys.\n\n46:08.920 --> 46:10.720\nDaily show left no dick on Pickles.\n\n46:10.720 --> 46:12.440\nOn Pickles, yeah.\n\n46:12.440 --> 46:14.120\nEvery now and then, a fucking Republican\n\n46:14.120 --> 46:16.880\nwould come through and be like, Pickle that dick, you know?\n\n46:16.880 --> 46:20.240\nPeople would be like, these guys are on the fucking pulse.\n\n46:20.240 --> 46:22.920\nThese guys are on the, they got their fucking beat\n\n46:22.920 --> 46:26.360\non the dick on the pulse, you know what I mean?\n\n46:26.360 --> 46:30.600\nDid you start doing stand-up, I assume,\n\n46:30.600 --> 46:32.440\nand then like kind of branched into writing,\n\n46:32.440 --> 46:33.000\nor were you always?\n\n46:33.000 --> 46:35.040\nI started doing stand-up right when I started.\n\n46:35.040 --> 46:37.000\nThis is not going to be that exciting.\n\n46:37.000 --> 46:40.600\nI was a lot, there was like, man. Hey, that's my job,\n\n46:40.600 --> 46:41.280\nsaying that.\n\n46:41.280 --> 46:44.280\nIt was, we were rapping before.\n\n46:44.280 --> 46:46.760\nLet me just say something very quickly about Long Island\n\n46:46.760 --> 46:48.680\nin its defense, all right?\n\n46:48.680 --> 46:50.000\nSurprisingly short.\n\n46:50.000 --> 46:51.120\nYes, surprisingly short.\n\n46:51.120 --> 46:54.600\nAlso, Brooklyn and Queens are on Long Island, all right?\n\n46:54.600 --> 46:56.840\nSo just for the record, when some fucking ding-dong\n\n46:56.840 --> 46:58.600\nfrom Brooklyn is like, you're going to Long Island,\n\n46:58.600 --> 47:01.320\nbe like, that's where you live, all right?\n\n47:01.320 --> 47:02.720\nThat's where you fucking live.\n\n47:02.720 --> 47:04.560\nWhen I was a kid, that's where you fucking live.\n\n47:04.560 --> 47:06.240\nIt's on the island, Brooklyn, Queens.\n\n47:06.240 --> 47:11.720\nWhen I was 10, me and my friend lit a telephone pole on fire.\n\n47:11.720 --> 47:12.720\nIt's the opposite of talking.\n\n47:12.720 --> 47:13.880\nThis can't be true.\n\n47:13.880 --> 47:14.800\nFor real.\n\n47:14.800 --> 47:18.360\nIt was the 4th of July, and we put a bunch of firecrackers\n\n47:18.360 --> 47:21.280\ninside a telephone pole because there was bugs in it.\n\n47:21.280 --> 47:23.240\nDo you know what telephone poles are?\n\n47:23.240 --> 47:26.800\nI feel like we're going to find out that it's like a coin\n\n47:26.800 --> 47:27.440\npurse or something.\n\n47:27.440 --> 47:28.960\nIt's like, no, there's a telephone pole.\n\n47:28.960 --> 47:31.360\nThere's those things with the leaves and apples.\n\n47:31.360 --> 47:32.560\nAnd they're very flammable.\n\n47:32.560 --> 47:33.440\nI also love that.\n\n47:33.440 --> 47:34.320\nIt was a big thing.\n\n47:34.320 --> 47:35.720\nYou're like, because there were bugs in it,\n\n47:35.720 --> 47:37.240\nyou did the right thing.\n\n47:37.240 --> 47:39.120\nI mean, you can't have bugs in a telephone pole.\n\n47:39.120 --> 47:41.720\nWe were 11 or 10 years old, and we were being assholes.\n\n47:41.720 --> 47:44.120\nAnd there was termites inside this telephone pole\n\n47:44.120 --> 47:45.000\nbecause of the thing.\n\n47:45.000 --> 47:47.920\nSo we put a bunch of firecrackers in it and fireworks.\n\n47:47.920 --> 47:49.240\nAnd then it lit on fire.\n\n47:49.240 --> 47:52.520\nAnd the fire department was sure to have that.\n\n47:52.520 --> 47:55.160\nThe guys who saved people, yeah, fire department.\n\n47:55.160 --> 47:56.280\nWe boned the fuck out.\n\n47:56.280 --> 47:59.240\nBut we lit a telephone pole on fire.\n\n47:59.240 --> 48:00.880\nWhat does it look like when it's on fire?\n\n48:00.880 --> 48:03.400\nIt looked like a giant tree without leaves on fire.\n\n48:03.400 --> 48:04.440\nWow.\n\n48:04.440 --> 48:07.360\nDid how long did service go down for?\n\n48:07.360 --> 48:08.320\nI don't know that it did.\n\n48:08.320 --> 48:08.920\nWow.\n\n48:08.920 --> 48:09.560\nThat's just a pole.\n\n48:09.560 --> 48:10.800\nThe telephone doesn't go through.\n\n48:10.800 --> 48:12.920\nI think that says a lot about landlines, guys.\n\n48:12.920 --> 48:14.080\nYou know what I mean?\n\n48:14.080 --> 48:15.800\nPeople are really against landlines these days.\n\n48:15.800 --> 48:16.680\nBut that says a lot.\n\n48:16.680 --> 48:19.680\nYou can light them right up on fire.\n\n48:19.680 --> 48:22.760\nTry lighting a fucking satellite on fire using your cell phone.\n\n48:22.760 --> 48:23.480\nIn Long Island?\n\n48:23.480 --> 48:24.520\nThere's an orange county, right?\n\n48:24.520 --> 48:25.600\nOrange county's in New Jersey.\n\n48:25.600 --> 48:26.200\nBut it doesn't matter.\n\n48:26.200 --> 48:27.000\nThere's counties and shit.\n\n48:27.000 --> 48:27.400\nNassau?\n\n48:27.400 --> 48:27.880\nNo, Nassau.\n\n48:27.880 --> 48:28.520\nNassau, yeah.\n\n48:28.520 --> 48:29.280\nNassau, yeah.\n\n48:29.280 -->

48:37.640\nThis is why I'm a bad host, because I'm still hung up\n\n48:37.640 --> 48:39.560\non something, and I haven't heard anything for the last three\n\n48:39.560 --> 48:40.040\nminutes.\n\n48:40.040 --> 48:44.240\nBut the didn't you tell me, Spencer,\n\n48:44.240 --> 48:46.600\nthat cell phones, when you call 911 on a cell phone,\n\n48:46.600 --> 48:49.320\nit's

48:56.840\nthere's a delay or something.\n\n48:56.840 --> 48:58.080\nYou look confused.\n\n48:58.080 --> 49:00.840\nI didn't say any of that.\n\n49:00.840 --> 49:02.480\nLike, we're all using cell phones now, but like.\n\n49:02.480 --> 49:04.080\nI remember when you said that shit, man.\n\n49:04.080 --> 49:05.840\nWhy are you bucking out of it now?\n\n49:05.840 --> 49:06.560\nThere's one thing

Robin would say shit like that.\n\n49:23.800 --> 49:26.520\nNow, do you feel like Dan is a better host than you?\n\n49:26.520 --> 49:27.840\nYes, I do.\n\n49:27.840 --> 49:28.880\nYes, I'm at the UCB.\n\n49:28.880 --> 49:31.040\nYou're supposed to say yes and to everything.\n\n49:31.040 --> 49:32.840\nThat's it.\n\n49:32.840 --> 49:35.360\nYes, and I think his dick's bigger.\n\n49:35.360 -->

49:51.040\nCall the president.\n\n49:51.040 --> 49:51.840\nAnd scene.\n\n49:51.840 --> 49:53.840\nYes, and.\n\n49:53.840 --> 49:54.920\nSee how I heightened it?\n\n49:54.920 --> 49:57.360\nYou got to call the president, because there's no one\n\n49:57.360 --> 49:58.400\nhigher than the president.\n\n49:58.400 --> 50:01.680\nIt's called UCB level fucking get it fucking get it down.\n\n50:01.680 --> 50:02.520\nYeah, man.\n\n50:02.520 --> 50:04.640\nI was just in a really great ass cat show.\n\n50:04.640 --> 50:05.920\nWas anybody, were any of you there?\n\n50:05.920 --> 50:08.760\nDid anybody hit the double jackpot of getting into that show\n\n50:08.760 --> 50:09.320\nand this one?\n\n50:09.320 --> 50:09.720\nWow.\n\n50:09.720 --> 50:10.120\nReally?\n\n50:10.120 --> 50:12.120\nAre you just,

50:16.840\nThere's two or three people that said yes.\n\n50:16.840 --> 50:18.480\nSometimes people down, I don't want to be a dick,\n\n50:18.480 --> 50:19.720\nbut it used to be yeast.\n\n50:19.720 --> 50:20.640\nDid you host it?\n\n50:20.640 --> 50:23.800\nLike, were you doing the monologue portion of it?\n\n50:23.800 --> 50:25.280\nHe intro'd all the performers.\n\n50:25.280 --> 50:26.760\nThey were there for 16 hours.\n\n50:26.760 --> 50:27.800\nYeah, yeah.\n\n50:27.800 --> 50:31.240\nIt was the only way to close out the Del Close marathon\n\n50:31.240 --> 50:33.360\nis they have Dan intro four people,\n\n50:33.360 --> 50:35.320\nand it takes up the whole 24 hours.\n\n50:35.320 --> 50:36.400\nDan is the Michael Jordan.\n\n50:36.400 --> 50:37.160\nYeah, that's the fact.\n\n50:37.160 --> 50:38.360\nThat's how they do it.\n\n50:38.360 --> 50:39.720\nIt's actually how Del Close died.\n\n50:39.720 --> 50:43.520\nI was introducing him to his doctor.\n\n50:43.520 --> 50:45.360\nYou were trying to tell his doctor what was wrong.\n\n50:45.360 --> 50:46.560\nYou're like, you have to understand.\n\n50:46.560 --> 50:47.360\nHe has this thing.\n\n50:47.360 --> 50:48.440\nLet me tell you about things.\n\n50:48.440 --> 50:51.560\nAnd then the guy, there was blood coming out of his.\n\n50:51.560 --> 50:52.400\nWhat do you call that hole?\n\n50:52.400 --> 50:53.360\nYou know what about holes?\n\n50:53.360 --> 50:54.040\nI like holes.\n\n50:54.040 --> 50:54.640\nEverything.\n\n50:54.640 --> 50:56.120\nI've been allowed to telephone, pull a fire.\n\n50:56.120 --> 50:57.720\nWhat's going on right now?\n\n50:57.720 --> 51:00.520\nSo the premise of this IFC thing.\n\n51:00.520 --> 51:03.120\nWell, you just said, I don't want to be a dick, but UCB East.\n\n51:03.120 --> 51:03.760\nWhat were you going to?\n\n51:03.760 --> 51:04.920\nI didn't want to use it.\n\n51:04.920 --> 51:05.480\nI don't remember.\n\n51:05.480 --> 51:07.080\nOh, it's something that's going to be stupid.\n\n51:07.080 --> 51:09.680\nIt made sense at the moment, but now it feels weird.\n\n51:09.680 --> 51:12.440\nI think now is the time to vent why you hate UCB so much.\n\n51:12.440 --> 51:15.240\nYeah, because they're so ungenerous.\n\n51:15.240 --> 51:16.080\nNo, it's cultish.\n\n51:16.080 --> 51:16.680\nIt's cultish.\n\n51:16.680 --> 51:17.520\nThat's my issue with it.\n\n51:17.520 --> 51:18.320\nYeah.\n\n51:18.320 --> 51:20.560\nLike, I had to fucking blow Matt Walsh three times just\n\n51:20.560 --> 51:21.520\nto get here tonight.\n\n51:21.520 --> 51:23.480\nYeah, true story.\n\n51:23.480 --> 51:25.080\nAnd I blew him years ago doing it.\n\n51:25.080 --> 51:26.080\nThis is it.\n\n51:26.080 --> 51:27.000\nAnd he denied it.\n\n51:27.000 --> 51:28.080\nYeah, he's an horrible impromptu.\n\n51:28.080 --> 51:29.680\nHe still denies it.\n\n51:29.680 --> 51:31.680\nHe says, no, but do it again.\n\n51:31.680 --> 51:33.160\nI'm like, what are you doing?\n\n51:33.160 --> 51:33.880\nWhat are you doing?\n\n51:33.880 --> 51:37.280\nHe's supposed to say, yes, hand reach under the ball.\n\n51:37.280 --> 51:39.120\nFucking basic shit.\n\n51:39.120 --> 51:40.840\nThat's fucking BJ's one.\n\n51:40.840 --> 51:42.080\nThat's level one BJ.\n\n51:42.080 --> 51:44.040\nI gave Matt Besser one of the worst hand jobs\n\n51:44.040 --> 51:44.600\nI've ever given.\n\n51:44.600 --> 51:45.920\nHeard about that hand job.\n\n51:45.920 --> 51:47.080\nI saw it's one man show.\n\n51:47.080 --> 51:49.600\nBad is Besser's bad HJs.\n\n51:49.600 --> 51:51.920\nThat's all that.\n\n51:51.920 --> 51:55.360\nThe show that we're doing on Wednesday, which I think it's\n\n51:55.360 --> 51:58.760\nalready, if you didn't move on the tweet that I sent out,\n\n51:58.760 --> 52:01.000\nthen I just feel bad for you.\n\n52:01.000 --> 52:04.000\nI sent out a tweet today because it's in another small space.\n\n52:04.000 --> 52:07.240\nSo I'm sure it was like, why am I being so cocky?\n\n52:07.240 --> 52:09.120\nWell, because it's not really cocky.\n\n52:09.120 --> 52:09.840\nIt doesn't feel cocky at all.\n\n52:09.840 --> 52:10.520\nIt doesn't feel cocky at all.\n\n52:10.520 --> 52:11.400\nIt feels sad.\n\n52:11.400 --> 52:14.920\nAnd it's like watching a guy brag about the size of his.\n\n52:14.920 --> 52:16.760\nWhen you're hosting the show, they say,\n\n52:16.760 --> 52:20.080\nDan, when we open the show, your camera is camera two.\n\n52:20.080 --> 52:21.760\nYou have to look right into camera two.\n\n52:21.760 --> 52:23.200\nAre you still going to look at the floor?\n\n52:23.200 --> 52:23.760\nI don't know.\n\n52:23.760 --> 52:24.680\nI'm not an idiot.\n\n52:24.680 --> 52:25.920\nI'm camera twos on the floor.\n\n52:25.920 --> 52:27.520\nThey know what they're doing.\n\n52:27.520 --> 52:29.040\nGuys, it's professionally produced.\n\n52:29.040 --> 52:30.360\nThey know what they're doing.\n\n52:33.560 --> 52:34.880\nI have no idea where it is.\n\n52:34.880 --> 52:35.920\n106 in park.\n\n52:35.920 --> 52:37.480\nDon't line up now, guys.\n\n52:37.480 --> 52:38.200\nYou'll get in.\n\n52:38.200 --> 52:40.240\nNow, Dan, we're sitting next to a guy that seems to be.\n\n52:40.240 --> 52:41.400\nDon't spend the weekend there.\n\n52:41.400 --> 52:43.240\nHe's got a great baritone voice.\n\n52:43.240 --> 52:43.740\nYeah.\n\n52:43.740 --> 52:44.240\nDo I?\n\n52:44.240 --> 52:45.240\nDo I?\n\n52:45.240 --> 52:46.960\nHe's not uncomfortable getting up and walking around\n\n52:46.960 --> 52:47.760\nand working the room.\n\n52:47.760 --> 52:48.640\nThis whole thing?\n\n52:48.640 --> 52:49.760\nYeah.\n\n52:49.760 --> 52:51.480\nHow did you listen to this guy?\n\n52:51.480 --> 52:55.720\nBecause I think that one of the guys at IFC, not the production\n\n52:55.720 --> 52:59.240\ncompany that's making the pilot, I think they're always like,\n\n52:59.240 --> 53:01.680\nIFC is so excited that you're hosting.\n\n53:01.680 --> 53:04.000\nSo I'm like, oh, that means you hate me.\n\n53:04.000 --> 53:12.480\nBut so I think maybe someone at IFC, maybe my dad called him.\n\n53:12.480 --> 53:13.280\nNo.\n\n53:13.280 --> 53:14.840\nAnd was like, listen to me.\n\n53:14.840 --> 53:15.840\nThis son works hard.\n\n53:15.840 --> 53:16.880\nWait a minute.\n\n53:16.880 --> 53:18.920\nWait, our dads were allowed to do that shit?\n\n53:18.920 --> 53:19.420\nYeah.\n\n53:19.420 --> 53:20.680\nI've called my dad off for years.\n\n53:20.680 --> 53:21.560\nWe were like, don't do it.\n\n53:21.560 --> 53:22.060\nDon't do it.\n\n53:22.060 --> 53:22.840\nNo, you shouldn't.\n\n53:22.840 --> 53:23.400\nOh my god.\n\n53:23.400 --> 53:23.960\nI mean, idiot.\n\n53:23.960 --> 53:26.720\nBecause if my dad calls you, you will fucking break down\n\n53:26.720 --> 53:27.400\nthere for a while.\n\n53:27.400 --> 53:30.680\nDo you know that they are capable of driving you all the way\n\n53:30.680 --> 53:32.160\nto McDonald's or school?\n\n53:32.160 --> 53:34.280\nAnd you don't have to get out a block away.\n\n53:34.280 --> 53:35.360\nThat's a choice you made.\n\n53:35.360 --> 53:36.200\nI didn't know that.\n\n53:36.200 --> 53:38.040\nWhen you are a flawed person because you visit,\n\n53:38.040 --> 53:39.920\nyou can rekindle that.\n\n53:39.920 --> 53:42.000\nDad, drive me all the way to McDonald's.\n\n53:42.000 --> 53:43.840\nYeah, wow.\n\n53:43.840 --> 53:46.720\nTake me back to the beginning of that story.\n\n53:46.720 --> 53:47.200\nYou know what?\n\n53:47.200 --> 53:48.480\nYour friends will see your dad.\n\n53:48.480 --> 53:50.200\nYou want him to see you disappear places.\n\n53:50.200 --> 53:50.760\nI get it.\n\n53:50.760 --> 53:52.800\nBefore you can drive, you don't want your friends\n\n53:52.800 --> 53:54.240\nto know your parents brought you.\n\n53:54.240 --> 53:56.600\nYou want them to think you just fucking, maybe you're\n\n53:56.600 --> 53:59.960\nlike in that awesome movie where they jump leapers, jumpers.\n\n53:59.960 --> 54:00.460\nLeapers?\n\n54:00.460 --> 54:02.080\nJumpers?\n\n54:02.080 --> 54:03.720\nWhat's that movie where they jump?\n\n54:03.720 --> 54:04.320\nWhat's that movie?\n\n54:04.320 --> 54:05.520\nI think it's Leapers.\n\n54:05.520 --> 54:09.600\nWas that leaping movie where they jump?\n\n54:09.600 --> 54:11.280\nWhat's the fucking name of that movie?\n\n54:11.280 --> 54:13.200\nThe sequel is Leapers 2.\n\n54:13.200 --> 54:16.080\nThe jumpers.\n\n54:16.080 --> 54:19.040\nNo, because sometimes I get loopers and jumpers confused,\n\n54:19.040 --> 54:20.440\nbut you don't want to do that shit, man.\n\n54:20.440 --> 54:21.280\nNo, no, don't look.\n\n54:21.280 --> 54:22.280\nYour fucking brain always plays.\n\n54:22.280 --> 54:24.400\nYou don't watch those movies back to back either.\n\n54:24.400 --> 54:26.800\nIt's like fucking ammonium bleach, guys.\n\n54:26.800 --> 54:28.000\nLeapers can't be jumpers.\n\n54:28.000 --> 54:29.000\nIs your dad still around?\n\n54:29.000 --> 54:29.480\nIs he alive?\n\n54:29.480 --> 54:30.240\nYeah, he's a leaper.\n\n54:30.240 --> 54:31.800\nAre you close with your dad?\n\n54:31.800 --> 54:34.680\nI was, and then he fucking leaped away for a pack of smokes.\n\n54:34.680 --> 54:35.560\nThat was 20.\n\n54:35.560 --> 54:38.360\nWhen I was 20, he was like, I'm going to leap for a pack of smokes.\n\n54:38.360 --> 54:39.360\nYeah, we're close enough.\n\n54:39.360 --> 54:39.840\nAre you close?\n\n54:39.840 --> 54:40.760\nAre you friends?\n\n54:40.760 --> 54:42.360\nWell, we're not friends.\n\n54:42.360 --> 54:42.800\nWe have a-\n\n54:42.800 --> 54:43.400\nCan you get along?\n\n54:43.400 --> 54:44.000\nAre you pals?\n\n54:44.000 --> 54:44.760\nOh, Jesus Christ.\n\n54:44.760 --> 54:46.440\nWhat's going on here right now?\n\n54:46.440 --> 54:49.800\nWe're going to cry a little bit now. I don't know, I mean, we could be close.\n\n54:49.800 --> 54:50.800\nWe don't know you.\n\n54:50.800 --> 54:51.800\nI don't know.\n\n54:51.800 --> 54:54.600\nI mean, do you call them up once in a while?\n\n54:54.600 --> 55:00.920\nYeah, I call them sometimes and for my mom, and then help pick up, so that I got a fucking,\n\n55:00.920 --> 55:02.200\nyou know, talk to him a little bit.\n\n55:02.200 --> 55:03.440\nWhat is it about that?\n\n55:03.440 --> 55:05.880\nI got to run interference, you know, I got to be like, yeah, yeah, that's good.\n\n55:05.880 --> 55:07.160\nWas mom around?\n\n55:07.160 --> 55:09.680\nBecause I have something I'd like to communicate to a human.\n\n55:09.680 --> 55:10.800\nSo you're close to mom, but not-\n\n55:10.800 --> 55:16.080\nThat's basically it. I don't know.\n\n55:16.080 --> 55:20.520\nAnyway, if you guys have ever seen Leapers, dude, that movie is fucking-\n\n55:20.520 --> 55:21.520\nLeapers can't be choosers?\n\n55:21.520 --> 55:23.240\nThey cannot. That's true.\n\n55:23.240 --> 55:25.840\nThat is sound advice, especially for the young people in the room.\n\n55:25.840 --> 55:27.520\nIf you're looking for a leaper, don't be picky.\n\n55:27.520 --> 55:29.000\nWhat is it about your dad that creates the distance?\n\n55:29.000 --> 55:29.520\nWell, what-\n\n55:29.520 --> 55:32.280\nI don't know, he's a fucking Italian guy, you know what I mean?\n\n55:32.280 --> 55:33.120\nHe's Italian.\n\n55:33.120 --> 55:33.760\nHe's Italian.\n\n55:33.760 --> 55:34.520\nYeah, he's Italian.\n\n55:34.520 --> 55:35.400\nHe pronounces it wrong.\n\n55:35.400 --> 55:37.640\nYeah, yeah, he's so Italian, he gets it wrong.\n\n55:37.640 --> 55:39.920\nAll Italians pronounce everything wrong.\n\n55:39.920 --> 55:42.080\nIt's not prosciutto, it's prosciutto.\n\n55:42.080 --> 55:43.600\nBut that's just New York.\n\n55:43.600 --> 55:46.080\nThat's just Goombat's behaviors, what that is.\n\n55:46.080 --> 55:46.760\nYou got the football-\n\n55:46.760 --> 55:49.360\nI have a half Goombat side, that's a little Goombat's.\n\n55:49.360 --> 55:50.080\nYou know what I mean?\n\n55:50.080 --> 55:50.560\nFoombats.\n\n55:50.560 --> 55:53.520\nYou guys, the one lady who cheered for Nassau County is like,\n\n55:53.520 --> 55:56.200\nhe fucking gets it.\n\n55:56.200 --> 56:00.240\nEverybody else is like, man, I don't know, Williamsburg doesn't have her.\n\n56:00.240 --> 56:02.520\nAre you a New York Italian all the way across the board?\n\n56:02.520 --> 56:03.880\nYeah, no, not all the way.\n\n56:03.880 --> 56:05.800\nThe other half is Jew.\n\n56:05.800 --> 56:09.480\nYeah, I'm sorry, don't leave.\n\n56:09.480 --> 56:11.480\nI never say you're a Jew in a crowded theater.\n\n56:11.480 --> 56:14.880\nI

Wednesday\n\n01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:06.960\ntonight, or I just will never be written.\n\n01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:07.600\nOh.\n\n01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:10.320\nGood night.\n\n01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:13.600\nWell, Jane's got a deep voice.\n\n01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:15.560\nThat's good.\n\n01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:18.520\nSo advice on, like, because you worked with one\n\n01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:19.560\nof the great TV hosts.\n\n01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:22.280\nIt took me up pretty easy.\n\n01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:23.720\nWe have to do this thing on Wednesday.\n\n01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:25.200\nThis guy was so drunk last night.\n\n01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:26.920\nThe premise of the pilot that we're doing\n\n01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:30.880\nis that I am the host, which is already kind of a premise.\n\n01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:32.360\nFirst of all, Dan's a great host.\n\n01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:34.240\nSo enough with this bullshit.\n\n01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:36.280\nSecond of all, the premise of the pilot\n\n01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:39.440\nis that he is it so Rupert Murdoch's son?\n\n01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:40.520\nIs that fucking it up?\n\n01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:43.360\nNo, I didn't hear the subplot version of the show\n\n01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:44.840\nyou guys developed before you got fired.\n\n01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:46.520\nYeah.\n\n01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:47.800\nI'm just talking about this now.\n\n01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:49.680\nAnd I come out, I do a big top dance number,\n\n01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:51.160\nand everyone loves me.\n\n01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:51.600\nWhat do you mean?\n\n01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:53.880\nI don't have the job.\n\n01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:56.480\nAnd there I am, just me and the people.\n\n01:03:56.480 --> 01:03:58.840\nAnd I'm singing a song.\n\n01:03:58.840 --> 01:04:00.000\nPapa, can you hear me?\n\n01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:00.720\nIt seems perfect.\n\n01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:02.160\nThis is for IFC.\n\n01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:03.520\nI said, top dance number.\n\n01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:06.480\nYour deal was about to close on your anti-vax blog,\n\n01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:09.120\nand they're like, this isn't going to work for you.\n\n01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:12.080\nThey saw my fucking, they saw my selfies\n\n01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:13.200\nwith fucking Jenny McCarthy.\n\n01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:13.800\nLike, she knows.\n\n01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:14.640\nShe gets it.\n\n01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:15.480\nShe gets it.\n\n01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:16.640\nWell, who's second on the list?\n\n01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:17.320\nI'm just kidding, guys.\n\n01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:18.240\nI have a selfie stick.\n\n01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:19.480\nI'm not an idiot.\n\n01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:20.920\nI'm not going to take a selfie with Jenny\n\n01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:22.280\nMcCarthy without a selfie stick.\n\n01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:24.480\nWhat's, what do we, I mean?\n\n01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:25.320\nGood try, Jane.\n\n01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:26.360\nGood try.\n\n01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:29.160\nLike, what, when you're doing, are there do's and don'ts,\n\n01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:30.120\nlike, on The Daily Show?\n\n01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:31.680\nSo John would have, you know, he's\n\n01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:33.720\ngot a guest in every episode virtually.\n\n01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:34.640\nThey're coming

01:04:43.280\nwas done through pre-interviews and stuff like that?\n\n01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:49.640\nIt depends on the guests.\n\n01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:51.400\nI mean, the thing that was interesting about The Daily\n\n01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:52.280\nShow.\n\n01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:54.280\nDumb-dubba-dumb-dumb-dubba-dumb-dubba-dumb.\n\n01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:55.980\nThe thing that was interesting about The Daily Show.\n\n01:04:55.980 --> 01:04:57.400\nDumb-dubba-dumb-dumb.\n\n01:04:57.400 --> 01:04:58.880\nOne pair.\n\n01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:00.380\nOne grey suit.\n\n01:05:00.380 --> 01:05:04.200\nLook, I'm more of a kill-borne man myself.\n\n01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:05.280\nThat's on The Daily Show.\n\n01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:07.000\nI love what, was Daily.\n\n01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:08.320\nI love when they, I love when like they crowd.\n\n01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:09.200\nHe's already fucked up.\n\n01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:11.400\nI love that they crowd groan, you know, they're like,\n\n01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:13.120\noh, dude, he's dead kill-borne.\n\n01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:14.220\nTake a big one, take it.\n\n01:05:14.220 --> 01:05:14.840\nGo, go.\n\n01:05:14.840 -->

Jim,\n\n01:05:19.940 --> 01:05:23.140\nAnd I'm not going to know at the end of the night.\n\n01:05:23.140 --> 01:05:24.300\nWell, funny you should say that.\n\n01:05:24.300 --> 01:05:25.420\nI'm just kidding, guys.\n\n01:05:25.420 --> 01:05:27.300\nI know gender is not a thing anymore.\n\n01:05:27.300 --> 01:05:29.220\nI get it.\n\n01:05:29.220 --> 01:05:29.820\nI'm kidding.\n\n01:05:29.820 --> 01:05:32.660\nJane, John, it's all shoulders up.\n\n01:05:32.660 --> 01:05:33.620\nI get it.\n\n01:05:33.620 --> 01:05:35.220\nIf you think you're a lady, you're a lady.\n\n01:05:35.220 --> 01:05:37.380\nI read the papers.\n\n01:05:37.380 --> 01:05:38.020\nThis is terrible.\n\n01:05:38.020 --> 01:05:40.820\nJane actually is a transgender.\n\n01:05:40.820 --> 01:05:41.700\nIt's not terrible.\n\n01:05:41.700 --> 01:05:42.660\nI think it's fantastic.\n\n01:05:42.660 --> 01:05:46.140\nI'm all for Jane being transgender.\n\n01:05:46.140 --> 01:05:48.540\nMy only issue with transgender is they say you're the only\n\n01:05:48.540 --> 01:05:50.020\nquestion you can't ask is, do you have a dick?\n\n01:05:50.020 --> 01:05:52.420\nAnd I keep saying, that's the only question I have.\n\n01:05:52.420 --> 01:05:55.500\nI can't ask that, then let's not talk about it.\n\n01:05:55.500 --> 01:05:59.220\nDid you see our mutual friend, John Oliver, this week\n\n01:05:59.220 --> 01:06:00.820\ntonight about the transgender thing?\n\n01:06:00.820 --> 01:06:01.320\nYes.\n\n01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:02.940\nWere you kind of like, like, surprised?\n\n01:06:02.940 --> 01:06:05.540\nI found myself feeling ashamed right away because already\n\n01:06:05.540 --> 01:06:08.620\nit's like, oh, like, I was patting myself on the back\n\n01:06:08.620 --> 01:06:11.620\njust for getting through the door of like, of not, you know,\n\n01:06:11.620 --> 01:06:12.780\nnot bullying and all this stuff.\n\n01:06:12.780 --> 01:06:15.580\nAnd it's like, and now they showed Barbara Walters going\n\n01:06:15.580 --> 01:06:17.940\nlike, so under your pants, what's going on?\n\n01:06:17.940 --> 01:06:19.900\nAnd it was kind of like, well, that's me.\n\n01:06:19.900 --> 01:06:20.580\nThat's me.\n\n01:06:20.580 --> 01:06:23.700\nI thought I was being progressive by asking all the details.\n\n01:06:23.700 --> 01:06:25.460\nI was like, oh, no, that doesn't make any sense.\n\n01:06:25.460 --> 01:06:27.020\nWhy would I do that?\n\n01:06:27.020 --> 01:06:28.700\nI'm constantly playing catch up.\n\n01:06:28.700 --> 01:06:31.740\nI always feel like, I just feel like this barbarian.\n\n01:06:31.740 --> 01:06:37.020\nI feel like this old, like, sad gorilla at the zoo that's just\n\n01:06:37.020 --> 01:06:40.540\nlike, keeps crushing kittens they bring to it.\n\n01:06:40.540 --> 01:06:42.660\nBecause it's replacing one that knows sign language.\n\n01:06:42.660 --> 01:06:45.820\nBut I just keep asking for ice cream and killing.\n\n01:06:45.820 --> 01:06:46.980\nI think that's OK.\n\n01:06:46.980 --> 01:06:49.260\nEvery zoo needs this gorilla that kills kittens.\n\n01:06:49.260 --> 01:06:50.100\nYou know what I mean?\n\n01:06:50.100 --> 01:06:52.820\nYou know how many fucking extra kittens they have at the zoo?\n\n01:06:52.820 --> 01:06:53.300\nYou have no idea.\n\n01:06:53.300 --> 01:06:54.660\nIt's a real problem.\n\n01:06:54.660 --> 01:06:56.100\nWell, New York still has a problem.\n\n01:06:56.100 --> 01:06:58.060\nThat comes out of our tax dollars, guys.\n\n01:06:58.060 --> 01:06:58.980\nFeeding those kittens.\n\n01:06:58.980 --> 01:07:00.900\nI'm not paying for that shit.\n\n01:07:00.900 --> 01:07:03.460\nThat's why we were like, gorilla's killing them.\n\n01:07:03.460 --> 01:07:05.260\nYou're already drunk on absent, aren't you?\n\n01:07:05.260 --> 01:07:08.620\nI don't know what I'm drunk on, but that shit's fucking dangerous.\n\n01:07:08.620 --> 01:07:11.820\nI seriously feel like I could have just taken a shot of fucking\n\n01:07:11.820 --> 01:07:15.860\ngolf, like, you know, 87, whatever.\n\n01:07:15.860 --> 01:07:17.980\nWhat's a fuel, like, 88, 9?\n\n01:07:17.980 --> 01:07:21.100\nI like that you went back to the 70s for a gas station.\n\n01:07:21.100 --> 01:07:23.740\nIs golf not a thing anymore?\n\n01:07:23.740 --> 01:07:25.620\nNo, golf's a fucking thing, guys.\n\n01:07:25.620 --> 01:07:26.540\nFuck you.\n\n01:07:26.540 --> 01:07:27.620\nGolf still exists.\n\n01:07:27.620 --> 01:07:28.540\nFuck you.\n\n01:07:28.540 --> 01:07:31.060\nI'll tell you right now, I don't drink from fucking BP spouts.\n\n01:07:31.060 --> 01:07:32.060\nAm I right?\n\n01:07:32.060 --> 01:07:32.620\nHuh?\n\n01:07:32.620 --> 01:07:33.140\nYeah.\n\n01:07:33.140 --> 01:07:35.300\nDon't support that.\n\n01:07:35.300 --> 01:07:36.500\nDon't support it.\n\n01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:38.380\nSee, you got to get in the crowd on my side.\n\n01:07:38.380 --> 01:07:39.220\nNo, yeah.\n\n01:07:39.220 --> 01:07:41.340\nThose stunts of bitches, yeah.\n\n01:07:41.340 --> 01:07:43.100\nI'm like, good gas, like Exxon.\n\n01:07:43.100 --> 01:07:45.020\nThere you go.\n\n01:07:45.020 --> 01:07:47.300\nThe good people over at Exxon.\n\n01:07:47.300 --> 01:07:49.900\nThey don't kill fucking dolphins and shit.\n\n01:07:49.900 --> 01:07:51.940\nThey just fucking make my SUV hum.\n\n01:07:51.940 --> 01:07:53.700\nYou're a standard oil guy from way back.\n\n01:07:53.700 --> 01:07:56.220\nI'm a big standard oil, man.\n\n01:07:56.220 --> 01:08:00.940\nThat's why I hate these filtered cigarettes, nonsense.\n\n01:08:00.940 --> 01:08:02.860\nIf I wanted a filter, I wanted a fucking...\n\n01:08:02.860 --> 01:08:03.940\nYou like your lucky strikes?\n\n01:08:03.940 --> 01:08:06.980\nI like my Paul Mauls, my lucky strikes.\n\n01:08:06.980 --> 01:08:08.820\nMy Virginia Slims wide.\n\n01:08:08.820 --> 01:08:10.180\nI like my Virginia Slims.\n\n01:08:10.180 --> 01:08:10.820\nThat's hard to get.\n\n01:08:10.820 --> 01:08:11.380\nUnfiltered.\n\n01:08:11.380 --> 01:08:12.940\nThat's hard to get.\n\n01:08:12.940 --> 01:08:16.060\nI like my Virginia Wides unfiltered.\n\n01:08:16.060 --> 01:08:18.180\nYou guys too young for that shit.\n\n01:08:18.180 --> 01:08:23.140\nHow does a host move from one topic to another?\n\n01:08:23.140 --> 01:08:26.140\nI don't know.\n\n01:08:26.140 --> 01:08:26.860\nMusic.\n\n01:08:26.860 --> 01:08:30.660\nYo, yo, yo, host, yo, yo, yo.\n\n01:08:30.660 --> 01:08:32.140\nI'm going to moderate discussion.\n\n01:08:32.140 --> 01:08:34.780\nGonna fuck your mama so hard I give her a concussion.\n\n01:08:34.780 --> 01:08:35.500\nGive us some.\n\n01:08:38.500 --> 01:08:39.260\nThat was good.\n\n01:08:39.260 --> 01:08:40.100\nYou were helping.\n\n01:08:40.100 --> 01:08:41.300\nListen, I'm going to tell you right now.\n\n01:08:41.300 --> 01:08:43.540\nIf I knew how to go from one thing to another,\n\n01:08:43.540 --> 01:08:45.660\nI might have gotten the job.\n\n01:08:45.660 --> 01:08:46.860\nThe wrong guy to ask.\n\n01:08:46.860 --> 01:08:48.580\nBut you want...\n\n01:08:48.580 --> 01:08:49.660\nI'm actually just kind of curious.\n\n01:08:49.660 --> 01:08:50.260\nI don't know.\n\n01:08:50.260 --> 01:08:50.980\nI'm not curious.\n\n01:08:50.980 --> 01:08:54.020\nI decided at some point that the angle was going to be\n\n01:08:54.020 --> 01:08:55.140\nthat I was going to get advice from you\n\n01:08:55.140 --> 01:08:56.060\nand how to be a good host.\n\n01:08:56.060 --> 01:08:58.940\nBut obviously, that's not what's organically pleasing.\n\n01:08:58.940 --> 01:09:00.180\nIt's stupid and I'm clinging to it.\n\n01:09:00.180 --> 01:09:01.820\nAll you have to do is be yourself.\n\n01:09:01.820 --> 01:09:04.220\nMy advice to you is to give me the advice to go with the flow.\n\n01:09:04.220 --> 01:09:04.900\nJust hold on.\n\n01:09:04.900 --> 01:09:06.820\nJust be yourself.\n\n01:09:06.820 --> 01:09:08.540\nThis dude's so fucking likable, right?\n\n01:09:08.540 --> 01:09:10.220\nIf he's just himself, yeah.\n\n01:09:10.220 --> 01:09:11.780\nHere's the thing.\n\n01:09:11.780 --> 01:09:13.020\nI want to take a moment.\n\n01:09:13.020 --> 01:09:13.820\nI want to take a moment.\n\n01:09:13.820 --> 01:09:16.660\nJust think about 9-11 for a second.\n\n01:09:16.660 --> 01:09:17.220\nAll right, cool.\n\n01:09:17.220 --> 01:09:19.380\nNow I'm just moving on to the host thing.\n\n01:09:19.380 --> 01:09:20.660\nI like this.\n\n01:09:20.660 --> 01:09:24.660\nNo, I'm saying the whole point is if people always\n\n01:09:24.660 --> 01:09:26.500\nmake an adjustment because they're on TV,\n\n01:09:26.500 --> 01:09:27.820\npeople always make an adjustment.\n\n01:09:27.820 --> 01:09:28.580\nThey're like, oh, do that.\n\n01:09:28.580 --> 01:09:30.060\nNow I got to be Dan Hormann on TV.\n\n01:09:30.060 --> 01:09:32.580\nNo, if you do that, you're going to feel like a weird version\n\n01:09:32.580 --> 01:09:33.020\nof yourself.\n\n01:09:33.020 --> 01:09:33.660\nJust be you.\n\n01:09:33.660 --> 01:09:34.620\nJust be you.\n\n01:09:34.620 --> 01:09:36.420\nMaybe dress like an adult.\n\n01:09:36.420 --> 01:09:37.260\nBut other than that...\n\n01:09:37.260 --> 01:09:40.340\nHa, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.\n\n01:09:40.340 --> 01:09:41.500\nJust be you, dude.\n\n01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:43.420\nI mean, don't fuck around.\n\n01:09:43.420 --> 01:09:45.140\nDon't fuck with fucking you.\n\n01:09:45.140 --> 01:09:46.420\nThis is why there's people here.\n\n01:09:46.420 --> 01:09:47.940\nLike, in other words, people like you.\n\n01:09:47.940 --> 01:09:49.340\nAnd I feel like if you try.\n\n01:09:49.340 --> 01:09:52.980\nI learned that back, I was doing a show back in, like,\n\n01:09:52.980 --> 01:09:54.620\nwith Sammy Davis Jr. a couple of years ago.\n\n01:09:54.620 --> 01:09:58.540\nAnd it was just a small jazz number.\n\n01:09:58.540 --> 01:10:00.060\nIt was a little jazz number, you may have heard of it.\n\n01:10:00.060 --> 01:10:03.260\nIt was called White Nights.\n\n01:10:03.260 --> 01:10:04.500\nIt was me and Gregory Hines.\n\n01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:05.500\nGregory Hines?\n\n01:10:05.500 --> 01:10:07.540\nAnd Baryshekov.\n\n01:10:07.540 --> 01:10:09.260\nYeah, Sammy, you were the third white guy.\n\n01:10:09.260 --> 01:10:11.940\nSammy Davis dropped by to just check in to make sure\n\n01:10:11.940 --> 01:10:12.780\nmy moves were right.\n\n01:10:12.780 --> 01:10:13.540\nWere you in White Nights?\n\n01:10:13.540 --> 01:10:14.620\nYeah, I was in White Nights.\n\n01:10:14.620 --> 01:10:15.780\nA lot of people don't know that.\n\n01:10:15.780 --> 01:10:17.340\nI played The Baby.\n\n01:10:17.340 --> 01:10:20.060\nYeah, yeah, there's a scene where Baryshekov's walking\n\n01:10:20.060 --> 01:10:22.020\nthrough Lincoln Center, and there's a lady\n\n01:10:22.020 --> 01:10:22.620\nholding a baby.\n\n01:10:22.620 --> 01:10:23.220\nThat was me.\n\n01:10:23.220 --> 01:10:23.980\nRubles.\n\n01:10:23.980 --> 01:10:24.460\nYeah.\n\n01:10:24.460 --> 01:10:26.700\nRubles, delicious rubles.\n\n01:10:26.700 --> 01:10:27.500\nYeah.\n\n01:10:27.500 --> 01:10:28.420\nNetflix, it guys.\n\n01:10:28.420 --> 01:10:29.100\nIt's a great flick.\n\n01:10:29.100 --> 01:10:29.860\nFor one guy that knows that.\n\n01:10:29.860 --> 01:10:30.980\nGregory Hines, fucking.\n\n01:10:30.980 --> 01:10:33.140\nAnd Leapers for your friend on your list.\n\n01:10:33.140 --> 01:10:33.860\nCan you tap his?\n\n01:10:33.860 --> 01:10:34.740\nJumpers?\n\n01:10:34.740 --> 01:10:35.300\nYeah, I can.\n\n01:10:35.300 --> 01:10:36.020\nI don't want to do it here.\n\n01:10:36.020 --> 01:10:36.340\nWhat?\n\n01:10:36.340 --> 01:10:37.260\nOK, I will.\n\n01:10:37.260 --> 01:10:38.660\nAll right.\n\n01:10:38.660 --> 01:10:40.140\nNow, show me one tap step.\n\n01:10:40.140 --> 01:10:40.900\nYou know one tap step.\n\n01:10:40.900 --> 01:10:43.340\nI don't know any tap steps, but if you gave me tap shoes,\n\n01:10:43.340 --> 01:10:44.420\nI bet I'd crush it.\n\n01:10:44.420 --> 01:10:46.060\nFor real?\n\n01:10:46.060 --> 01:10:46.940\nI don't feel like I need.\n\n01:10:46.940 --> 01:10:50.700\nI feel like tap dancing is a dance that's just in my blood.\n\n01:10:50.700 --> 01:10:54.220\nI feel like Italians and Jews have always nominated tap.\n\n01:10:54.220 --> 01:10:55.980\nTap has been our fucking old craft.\n\n01:10:55.980 --> 01:10:58.060\nI can't think of the times I've gone to a Italian restaurant\n\n01:10:58.060 --> 01:11:00.980\nwhere there wasn't an Italian guy tap dancing.\n\n01:11:00.980 --> 01:11:02.940\nJust some Italian guy with an accordion.\n\n01:11:02.940 --> 01:11:04.940\nJust fucking.\n\n01:11:04.940 --> 01:11:07.420\nOh.\n\n01:11:07.420 --> 01:11:08.260\nWho's got time for this?\n\n01:11:08.260 --> 01:11:10.380\nThat's the most important thing.\n\n01:11:10.380 --> 01:11:11.540\nIt's all about the hands.\n\n01:11:11.540 --> 01:11:13.180\nBecause a lot of people think it's about the feet.\n\n01:11:13.180 --> 01:11:14.580\nIt's not.\n\n01:11:14.580 --> 01:11:16.860\nThe feet are just tapping the fucking arms.\n\n01:11:16.860 --> 01:11:18.180\nThat's where the magic happens.\n\n01:11:18.180 --> 01:11:20.220\nWho is your favorite Italian tap dancer?\n\n01:11:20.220 --> 01:11:23.980\nOh, it's got to be Giovanni Pocciangi.\n\n01:11:23.980 --> 01:11:26.660\nI mean, whose feet move like Pocciangi?\n\n01:11:26.660 --> 01:11:29.420\nThey called him Old Stonefoot, which\n\n01:11:29.420 --> 01:11:32.060\nwas his horrible name because he had fucking the wonderful feet.\n\n01:11:32.060 --> 01:11:35.980\nWell, but they were referring to the strength of the tap.\n\n01:11:35.980 --> 01:11:37.380\nIt wasn't about weight for him.\n\n01:11:37.380 --> 01:11:40.700\nIt was like, wow, every step he takes is like,\n\n01:11:40.700 --> 01:11:44.020\npermanent and heavy.\n\n01:11:44.020 --> 01:11:44.700\nThat's true.\n\n01:11:44.700 --> 01:11:46.580\nThey used to say in Italian, it sounds beautiful.\n\n01:11:46.580 --> 01:11:48.220\nThey said, pranccianni moriocchiata,\n\n01:11:48.220 --> 01:11:50.380\nwhich means you know he tapped there.\n\n01:11:50.380 --> 01:11:51.860\nThat's what that means.\n\n01:11:51.860 --> 01:11:55.220\nThere's a little fucking dent in the piazza.\n\n01:11:55.220 --> 01:11:59.780\nEvery piazza in Southern Napoli has a little dent in it.\n\n01:11:59.780 --> 01:12:05.500\nThere's an urban legend about Giovanni Pocciangi,\n\n01:12:05.500 --> 01:12:10.860\nabout Giobini, that he, I mean, it is true that he.\n\n01:12:10.860 --> 01:12:11.260\nI see.\n\n01:12:11.260 --> 01:12:12.460\nI know you're going to say it.\n\n01:12:12.460 --> 01:12:14.740\nI think this is absolutely apocryphal, but go on.\n\n01:12:14.740 --> 01:12:19.260\nWell, but it is true that he was at the Yalta Conference.\n\n01:12:19.260 --> 01:12:21.860\nHe's right behind Stone.\n\n01:12:21.860 --> 01:12:23.900\nWell, he was there as a performer,\n\n01:12:23.900 --> 01:12:26.900\nbut the urban legend, because I don't actually\n\n01:12:26.900 --> 01:12:30.620\nbelieve this is possible, but that he did a dance for them.\n\n01:12:30.620 --> 01:12:32.740\nAnd at the end of every Italian tap dance,\n\n01:12:32.740 --> 01:12:34.860\nif you do it the Italian way, there's always,\n\n01:12:34.860 --> 01:12:37.820\nit's called the cabrese, the final tap.\n\n01:12:37.820 --> 01:12:41.020\nNo, cabrese is like a salad with tomatoes and mozzarella.\n\n01:12:41.020 --> 01:12:42.780\nIt's called the cabrazio.\n\n01:12:42.780 --> 01:12:46.180\nCabrazio is the fun.\n\n01:12:46.180 --> 01:12:46.940\nI love a cabrese.\n\n01:12:46.940 --> 01:12:54.140\nIt's ciubacci cabrese, which is the tap to end the tap.\n\n01:12:54.140 --> 01:12:55.700\nOr the tap of all taps.\n\n01:12:55.700 --> 01:12:56.220\nRight.\n\n01:12:56.220 --> 01:12:57.140\nSo he went cabra.\n\n01:12:57.140 --> 01:13:00.380\nHe did tap of the tutti-tapi.\n\n01:13:00.380 --> 01:13:03.860\nThe urban legend is that his was so hard\n\n01:13:03.860 --> 01:13:07.700\nthat it vibrated Stalin.\n\n01:13:07.700 --> 01:13:10.180\nIt turned him into a Democrat.\n\n01:13:10.180 --> 01:13:11.060\nThat's true.\n\n01:13:11.060 --> 01:13:12.100\nFor 10 minutes.\n\n01:13:12.100 --> 01:13:12.740\nThat's true.\n\n01:13:12.740 --> 01:13:15.860\nBut then he forgot all of Marx's teachings.\n\n01:13:15.860 --> 01:13:19.180\nHe went right back and broke the agreement on Poland\n\n01:13:19.180 --> 01:13:20.620\nand went right back into it.\n\n01:13:20.620 --> 01:13:21.780\nFor 10 minutes, though.\n\n01:13:21.780 --> 01:13:24.300\nI mean, that's longer than any of us can tap someone's\n\n01:13:24.300 --> 01:13:25.740\npolitical views out of their heart.\n\n01:13:25.740 --> 01:13:26.260\nYeah.\n\n01:13:26.260 --> 01:13:29.060\nAnd this is going to seem like a really bad pun.\n\n01:13:29.060 --> 01:13:30.820\nBut this is just a historical fact.\n\n01:13:30.820 --> 01:13:31.300\nGive it to me.\n\n01:13:31.300 --> 01:13:32.260\nNot a little bit of time.\n\n01:13:32.260 --> 01:13:34.060\nThat lag, that 10 minutes of lag,\n\n01:13:34.060 --> 01:13:36.540\nis where they came up with the term gulag.\n\n01:13:36.540 --> 01:13:38.700\nThat's when people go to the gulag.\n\n01:13:38.700 --> 01:13:39.220\nOh, boy.\n\n01:13:39.220 --> 01:13:42.060\nI told you it was going to seem like a bad pun.\n\n01:13:42.060 --> 01:13:42.660\nBut it's not.\n\n01:13:42.660 --> 01:13:44.260\nThat's just a historical fact.\n\n01:13:44.260 --> 01:13:45.020\nAre you Stalin?\n\n01:13:45.020 --> 01:13:46.020\nAre you Stalin for time?\n\n01:13:46.020 --> 01:13:47.220\nI watch a history channel.\n\n01:13:47.220 --> 01:13:48.580\nStalin for time, everybody.\n\n01:13:48.580 --> 01:13:50.340\nYes, I am Stalin for time.\n\n01:13:50.340 --> 01:13:51.300\nGulag.\n\n01:13:51.300 --> 01:13:55.340\nI'm Hitler and then with my greatest Hitlers.\n\n01:13:55.340 --> 01:13:57.660\nThese are my greatest Hitlers.\n\n01:13:57.660 --> 01:13:59.900\nYou kicked me in my soul, Genetian.\n\n01:13:59.900 --> 01:14:01.300\nNot a fact, not even a thing.\n\n01:14:01.300 --> 01:14:02.180\nVery nice.\n\n01:14:02.180 --> 01:14:03.060\nNow we're doing it.\n\n01:14:03.060 --> 01:14:05.820\nI really, I really, I don't, I don't.\n\n01:14:05.820 --> 01:14:06.300\nSo many.\n\n01:14:06.300 --> 01:14:06.860\nFalklands.\n\n01:14:06.860 --> 01:14:08.500\nSo many of.\n\n01:14:08.500 --> 01:14:11.300\nJust trying to name some shit.\n\n01:14:11.300 --> 01:14:13.860\nMany, many, many, many.\n\n01:14:13.860 --> 01:14:16.580\nMore than fucking Rhineland.\n\n01:14:16.580 --> 01:14:18.940\nWhere the whole war started over fucking Rhineland, guys.\n\n01:14:18.940 --> 01:14:21.340\nWhat is your stance over the Falklands?\n\n01:14:21.340 --> 01:14:21.900\nYou know what?\n\n01:14:21.900 --> 01:14:23.220\nFucking take them and leave them.\n\n01:14:23.220 --> 01:14:25.020\nI'm going to give a shit.\n\n01:14:25.020 --> 01:14:28.820\nYou guys, you know me.\n\n01:14:28.820 --> 01:14:30.300\nWith the Falklands, I give a fuck.\n\n01:14:30.300 --> 01:14:31.540\nYou know what I mean?\n\n01:14:31.540 --> 01:14:32.380\nThat was a Jewish time.\n\n01:14:32.380 --> 01:14:33.140\nMaybe it's the absence.\n\n01:14:33.140 --> 01:14:34.100\nThat was a Jewish mom talking.\n\n01:14:34.100 --> 01:14:35.380\nMaybe it's the absence of talking.\n\n01:14:35.380 --> 01:14:36.100\nFalkland too.\n\n01:14:36.100 --> 01:14:37.500\nWho needs, who needs to worry?\n\n01:14:37.500 --> 01:14:38.980\nYeah, you got to worry.\n\n01:14:38.980 --> 01:14:40.940\nCall me when it's one Falkland, like a republic.\n\n01:14:40.940 --> 01:14:42.020\nHow many nights?\n\n01:14:42.020 --> 01:14:43.140\nThe Falkland Republic.\n\n01:14:43.140 --> 01:14:44.220\nThose are fucking Falklands.\n\n01:14:44.220 --> 01:14:44.940\nIt's like, what is it?\n\n01:14:44.940 --> 01:14:47.980\nLike, like, like, like, pick one and get your shit together.\n\n01:14:47.980 --> 01:14:50.540\nAnd then we'll invade you instead of the fucking British.\n\n01:14:50.540 --> 01:14:53.500\nBy the way, 15 years ago, there was a great Peter Fawkes\n\n01:14:53.500 --> 01:14:54.100\njoke to be made.\n\n01:14:54.100 --> 01:14:55.860\nBut with this crowd, it'll never go.\n\n01:14:55.860 --> 01:14:56.700\nNo, never.\n\n01:14:56.700 --> 01:14:59.180\nPretend it's 1982.\n\n01:14:59.180 --> 01:15:01.140\nAnd give us your Peter Fawkes joke.\n\n01:15:01.140 --> 01:15:02.540\nGive us your Peter Fawkes joke.\n\n01:15:02.540 --> 01:15:05.060\nHave you guys ever take UCB 1982?\n\n01:15:05.060 --> 01:15:06.380\nYou ever take that guy's fucking?\n\n01:15:06.380 --> 01:15:07.180\nIt gets you really high.\n\n01:15:07.180 --> 01:15:09.900\nIt's a really good class.\n\n01:15:09.900 --> 01:15:13.820\nYeah, that's my Harold group.\n\n01:15:13.820 --> 01:15:17.300\nPeter, they get really mad when you fuck with the UCB, man.\n\n01:15:17.300 --> 01:15:19.380\nThey're like, yo, bro, East Side fucking shit.\n\n01:15:19.380 --> 01:15:20.300\nWell, we're in there.\n\n01:15:20.300 --> 01:15:22.180\nIt's like, oh, they were taking a shit on there.\n\n01:15:22.180 --> 01:15:24.980\nUCB, you know what I mean?\n\n01:15:24.980 --> 01:15:26.820\nIt's like, you couldn't get it across town.\n\n01:15:26.820 --> 01:15:27.340\nYou come here.\n\n01:15:27.340 --> 01:15:27.840\nI get it.\n\n01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:29.740\nDon't worry about it.\n\n01:15:29.740 --> 01:15:30.540\nI take my agrar.\n\n01:15:30.540 --> 01:15:32.500\nI get it.\n\n01:15:32.500 --> 01:15:34.100\nI can't get a C. Alice prescription.\n\n01:15:34.100 --> 01:15:34.780\nYou get you understand.\n\n01:15:34.780 --> 01:15:36.780\nYou guys know what I'm talking about.\n\n01:15:36.780 --> 01:15:42.140\nThere's a lot of a lot of my fan.\n\n01:15:42.140 --> 01:15:43.900\nI don't like saying my fans because it feels.\n\n01:15:43.900 --> 01:15:45.380\nBut I don't want to talk about that.\n\n01:15:45.380 --> 01:15:47.460\nBut I don't know how to quickly say it.\n\n01:15:47.460 --> 01:15:50.060\nWell, a lot of my fans seem to be punsters.\n\n01:15:50.060 --> 01:15:50.860\nLike they like puns.\n\n01:15:50.860 --> 01:15:53.020\nAnd I find it very, very uncomfortable.\n\n01:15:53.020 --> 01:15:54.020\nReally?\n\n01:15:54.020 --> 01:15:55.940\nThat's the best group of fans to have.\n\n01:15:55.940 --> 01:15:58.300\nPeople who understand horrible things.\n\n01:15:58.300 --> 01:16:00.740\nNo, because in other words, you know in a comedy writer's room,\n\n01:16:00.740 --> 01:16:04.380\nand this is a weird thing, is like in a comedy writer's room,\n\n01:16:04.380 --> 01:16:07.020\nsometimes the worst version of a joke\n\n01:16:07.020 --> 01:16:08.300\nis the funniest thing in the room.\n\n01:16:08.300 --> 01:16:09.300\nDo you know what I'm talking about?\n\n01:16:09.300 --> 01:16:10.820\nWell, I mean, you go to that place.\n\n01:16:10.820 --> 01:16:12.100\nYou would never put it on the show.\n\n01:16:12.100 --> 01:16:13.620\nYeah, but never a well.\n\n01:16:13.620 --> 01:16:15.140\nI mean, you must be suggestive.\n\n01:16:15.140 --> 01:16:17.100\nI feel like you have a daily show story\n\n01:16:17.100 --> 01:16:18.820\nabout how a pun I could think of.\n\n01:16:18.820 --> 01:16:21.580\nBut there's loads of puns on that show.\n\n01:16:21.580 --> 01:16:23.220\nWell, you guys always connected everything\n\n01:16:23.220 --> 01:16:25.460\nof the mortis or whatever you call it over John Shoulder.\n\n01:16:25.460 --> 01:16:27.380\nYeah, but those are technically puns.\n\n01:16:27.380 --> 01:16:28.420\nYeah, and they're good.\n\n01:16:28.420 --> 01:16:29.180\nIt's wordplay.\n\n01:16:29.180 --> 01:16:31.540\nWe used to do the Ted Kazarinsky thing.\n\n01:16:31.540 --> 01:16:33.100\nYou know what I'm talking about?\n\n01:16:33.100 --> 01:16:34.380\nTim Kazarinsky, remember?\n\n01:16:34.380 --> 01:16:36.340\nThe Rintin Tinfluenza.\n\n01:16:36.340 --> 01:16:40.060\nKeep on knocking, but you can't come in, fluenza.\n\n01:16:40.060 --> 01:16:42.780\nI mean, once that shit opened up,\n\n01:16:42.780 --> 01:16:46.580\nso there was a guy in Saturday Night Live who was a writer.\n\n01:16:46.580 --> 01:16:47.140\nGoogle him.\n\n01:16:47.140 --> 01:16:48.420\nThe same as Kazarinsky.\n\n01:16:48.420 --> 01:16:49.180\nIt's Tim, right?\n\n01:16:49.180 --> 01:16:49.660\nYeah.\n\n01:16:49.660 --> 01:16:50.180\nOK.\n\n01:16:50.180 --> 01:16:51.380\nHe was on the cast for a while.\n\n01:16:51.380 --> 01:16:52.340\nYeah, he was on the cast.\n\n01:16:52.340 --> 01:16:53.580\nT-Cast.\n\n01:16:53.580 --> 01:16:54.620\nT-Cast, we call him.\n\n01:16:54.620 --> 01:16:56.380\nBut wasn't it the Dick Ebersol years?\n\n01:16:56.380 --> 01:16:57.180\nThe Dick Ebersol years?\n\n01:16:57.180 --> 01:16:58.180\nI think it might have been.\n\n01:16:58.180 --> 01:16:59.500\nYeah, with, yeah.\n\n01:16:59.500 --> 01:17:01.860\nHe was in school like a second city guy,\n\n01:17:01.860 --> 01:17:03.460\nway back in a very good cast.\n\n01:17:03.460 --> 01:17:06.980\nSo try to explain that, because once you open that wormhole\n\n01:17:06.980 --> 01:17:08.620\nof bad jokery, you will.\n\n01:17:08.620 --> 01:17:10.780\nAnd it's great jokery in the beginning,\n\n01:17:10.780 --> 01:17:11.780\nand then it just takes.\n\n01:17:11.780 --> 01:17:12.620\nBut there's a point.\n\n01:17:12.620 --> 01:17:15.260\nThe influential one is, I remember being a little kid.\n\n01:17:15.260 --> 01:17:16.860\nI was a kid during the Ebersol years.\n\n01:17:16.860 --> 01:17:18.740\nThere was Martin Short also, Ebersol.\n\n01:17:18.740 --> 01:17:19.820\nYeah, and I think.\n\n01:17:19.820 --> 01:17:24.660\nWhat's his face from all the 16 Canon movies and shit?\n\n01:17:24.660 --> 01:17:25.220\nWhat's his name?\n\n01:17:25.220 --> 01:17:27.020\nOh, Anthony Michael Hall.\n\n01:17:27.020 --> 01:17:27.940\nAnthony Michael Hall.\n\n01:17:27.940 --> 01:17:29.260\nVery good.\n\n01:17:29.260 --> 01:17:32.300\nAnd Elaine and Robert Downey Jr.\n\n01:17:32.300 --> 01:17:33.260\nElaine from Seinfeld.\n\n01:17:33.260 --> 01:17:33.900\nBrad Hall.\n\n01:17:33.900 --> 01:17:34.700\nGary Kroger.\n\n01:17:34.700 --> 01:17:37.100\nWho can forget the K-Rogue?\n\n01:17:37.100 --> 01:17:38.340\nNo, Rich Hall.\n\n01:17:38.340 --> 01:17:38.740\nRich Hall.\n\n01:17:38.740 --> 01:17:39.420\nSniglets.\n\n01:17:39.420 --> 01:17:41.180\nBut the weird thing is that I actually\n\n01:17:41.180 --> 01:17:43.300\nlearned comedy from that season, because that\n\n01:17:43.300 --> 01:17:45.540\nwas when I was sort of going through comedy puberty,\n\n01:17:45.540 --> 01:17:47.300\nin that it was like, all of a sudden,\n\n01:17:47.300 --> 01:17:49.820\nI was combined comedy and puberty in one word.\n\n01:17:52.820 --> 01:17:53.300\nCuberty.\n\n01:17:53.300 --> 01:17:55.420\nThrow it to a room, and to take the terrible one,\n\n01:17:55.420 --> 01:17:57.220\nand then that's your process.\n\n01:17:57.220 --> 01:17:57.980\nThat's a Rinsky.\n\n01:18:01.180 --> 01:18:03.380\nEverybody goes like, oh, that was terrible,\n\n01:18:03.380 --> 01:18:06.180\nbut it's like, did you ever hear this about SNL that they go,\n\n01:18:06.180 --> 01:18:07.780\neverybody thinks that SNL was perfect.\n\n01:18:07.780 --> 01:18:09.260\nThe year they were 10, and everybody\n\n01:18:09.260 --> 01:18:11.140\nthinks that it's currently in some kind of slump.\n\n01:18:11.140 --> 01:18:11.860\nYes, always.\n\n01:18:11.860 --> 01:18:14.060\nExcept if it 10-year-old came up right now, they'd be like,\n\n01:18:14.060 --> 01:18:16.020\ndid you see fucking the thing I was saying?\n\n01:18:16.020 --> 01:18:17.900\nAnd they'd be right, because it's all 12.\n\n01:18:17.900 --> 01:18:18.660\nI always say 12.\n\n01:18:18.660 --> 01:18:20.300\nYeah, 12, you're like sixth grade.\n\n01:18:20.300 --> 01:18:21.100\nThat's like 12, right?\n\n01:18:21.100 --> 01:18:23.220\nSix to eighth grade, it's the fucking best show ever.\n\n01:18:23.220 --> 01:18:25.220\nWhen did your ass get rock hard?\n\n01:18:25.220 --> 01:18:25.620\nMine?\n\n01:18:25.620 --> 01:18:26.540\nIs that 12?\n\n01:18:26.540 --> 01:18:27.020\nMine?\n\n01:18:27.020 --> 01:18:28.620\nI'm still waiting on that.\n\n01:18:28.620 --> 01:18:30.340\nBecause I remember that's what it was.\n\n01:18:30.340 --> 01:18:32.780\nI was watching Ed Grimly, and he was going, I must say,\n\n01:18:32.780 --> 01:18:35.060\nand I was like, whoa, my ass is really hard,\n\n01:18:35.060 --> 01:18:36.260\nand that's really funny.\n\n01:18:36.260 --> 01:18:37.580\nWhy was your ass rock hard?\n\n01:18:37.580 --> 01:18:40.100\nI was like, non-sequitur, kind of weird pedophile joke.\n\n01:18:40.100 --> 01:18:45.740\nI have a mnemonic device for how to remember a 12-year-old.\n\n01:18:45.740 --> 01:18:47.660\nI don't think there's anything weird about talking\n\n01:18:47.660 --> 01:18:49.660\nabout 12-year-old asses, OK?\n\n01:18:49.660 --> 01:18:52.340\nMaybe I'm in the fucking minority here.\n\n01:18:52.340 --> 01:18:54.580\nTrying to get your back here, bro.\n\n01:18:54.580 --> 01:18:56.460\nI don't know how to get out of this one.\n\n01:18:56.460 --> 01:18:57.580\nBut that's all I did.\n\n01:18:57.580 --> 01:18:58.940\nI mean, you're a couple of years younger than me.\n\n01:18:58.940 --> 01:19:00.900\nWhat do you think about the bit where I whispered with the mic\n\n01:19:00.900 --> 01:19:01.580\nto my mouth?\n\n01:19:01.580 --> 01:19:02.540\nDoes that work?\n\n01:19:02.540 --> 01:19:02.940\nI don't know.\n\n01:19:02.940 --> 01:19:03.700\nI do that all the time.\n\n01:19:03.700 --> 01:19:06.300\nBecause I feel like that's negating the whole point\n\n01:19:06.300 --> 01:19:07.100\nof the whisper.\n\n01:19:07.100 --> 01:19:08.340\nDon't ask for my input.\n\n01:19:08.340 --> 01:19:09.820\nYou're fucking.\n\n01:19:09.820 --> 01:19:11.660\nWhy is he not the host?\n\n01:19:11.660 --> 01:19:12.980\nHe's already a better host.\n\n01:19:12.980 --> 01:19:13.980\nHe should host Harmontown.\n\n01:19:13.980 --> 01:19:16.020\nIt's just not appropriate, because it's good.\n\n01:19:16.020 --> 01:19:18.220\nAnyway, explain the show.\n\n01:19:18.220 --> 01:19:19.900\nThere's a time machine involved.\n\n01:19:19.900 --> 01:19:22.940\nDan's got fucking spent all of his hard earned money.\n\n01:19:22.940 --> 01:19:24.540\nOh, this is the premise of the show, actually.\n\n01:19:24.540 --> 01:19:25.460\nHe spent all of it.\n\n01:19:25.460 --> 01:19:28.260\nHe spent all of his hard earned money inventing a time machine.\n\n01:19:28.260 --> 01:19:29.060\nAnd you go, wow.\n\n01:19:29.060 --> 01:19:30.660\nSo we can solve the world's problems?\n\n01:19:30.660 --> 01:19:31.460\nNope.\n\n01:19:31.460 --> 01:19:34.300\nSo we can host a talk show with people from history.\n\n01:19:34.300 --> 01:19:36.460\nAnd then solve the world's problems, hopefully,\n\n01:19:36.460 --> 01:19:37.020\nby getting.\n\n01:19:37.020 --> 01:19:38.540\nBy talking to people from history.\n\n01:19:38.540 --> 01:19:39.780\nBut he could go back in time.\n\n01:19:39.780 --> 01:19:40.420\nSo can we talk?\n\n01:19:40.420 --> 01:19:41.940\nHey, Rich, can you hear me?\n\n01:19:41.940 --> 01:19:43.260\nWhat if he can't?\n\n01:19:43.260 --> 01:19:44.660\nThis is a terrible, terrible theater.\n\n01:19:44.660 --> 01:19:45.180\nTerrible.\n\n01:19:45.180 --> 01:19:45.860\nSounds to.\n\n01:19:45.860 --> 01:19:46.660\nBut he might not be here.\n\n01:19:46.660 --> 01:19:49.540\nBut Rich, can you answer me one question?\n\n01:19:49.540 --> 01:19:51.500\nRich Corson is the executive producer, everybody.\n\n01:19:51.500 --> 01:19:53.100\nSo is it?\n\n01:19:53.100 --> 01:19:56.340\nAnd also, former Daily Show producer,\n\n01:19:56.340 --> 01:19:57.900\nhe's sort of like, Ron Comisani.\n\n01:19:57.900 --> 01:19:59.700\nRich Corson, you should clap for him.\n\n01:19:59.700 --> 01:20:01.100\nRich, ladies, if you'd like.\n\n01:20:01.100 --> 01:20:02.740\nYou said it was OK to talk about the show.\n\n01:20:02.740 --> 01:20:05.580\nIs it OK to tell him who the cast is?\n\n01:20:05.580 --> 01:20:06.180\nOK.\n\n01:20:06.180 --> 01:20:09.380\nSo like, Robert Smigel is playing Albert Einstein.\n\n01:20:09.380 --> 01:20:14.180\nAnd Rory is playing Benjamin Franklin.\n\n01:20:14.180 --> 01:20:17.060\nAnd nice, dude.\n\n01:20:17.060 --> 01:20:19.100\nFucking perfect use of the fart noise.\n\n01:20:19.100 --> 01:20:22.300\nSomebody took UCB level four fart noise.\n\n01:20:22.300 --> 01:20:25.260\nThat guy's seven grand into his first work show.\n\n01:20:25.260 --> 01:20:28.020\nHis parents are on the back, they're like, worth every penny,\n\n01:20:28.020 --> 01:20:31.020\nJared.\n\n01:20:31.020 --> 01:20:32.460\nTotally worth it.\n\n01:20:32.460 --> 01:20:35.820\nFour classes a kid now had fart noise.\n\n01:20:35.820 --> 01:20:39.300\nHe has a green belt in fart prof.\n\n01:20:39.300 --> 01:20:41.660\nHe's not an OT yet.\n\n01:20:41.660 --> 01:20:42.620\nJust keep spending.\n\n01:20:42.620 --> 01:20:44.860\nAt some point, you'll be in a movie.\n\n01:20:44.860 --> 01:20:47.620\nAt the end of the level five workshop,\n\n01:20:47.620 --> 01:20:49.860\nthey take you to a room where Matt Besser has written\n\n01:20:49.860 --> 01:20:54.220\nin a notebook that Improv was created by horses.\n\n01:20:54.220 --> 01:20:58.580\nHe's referencing Scientology, assholes.\n\n01:20:58.580 --> 01:21:01.100\nHe's spending it in a system that won't help you.\n\n01:21:01.100 --> 01:21:02.500\nGet out while you can.\n\n01:21:02.500 --> 01:21:06.420\nSeriously, though, folks, how about fucking Scientology?\n\n01:21:06.420 --> 01:21:07.660\nSeriously.\n\n01:21:07.660 --> 01:21:09.980\nI don't want to be unentertainingly sycophantic,\n\n01:21:09.980 --> 01:21:13.700\nbut I do feel like I want to add a footnote that I don't.\n\n01:21:13.700 --> 01:21:16.140\nI'm very happy that UCB had us here.\n\n01:21:16.140 --> 01:21:18.260\nAnd I do their shows all the time.\n\n01:21:18.260 --> 01:21:20.820\nI have a great time with their wonderful people.\n\n01:21:20.820 --> 01:21:22.100\nI want to add a footnote that says,\n\n01:21:22.100 --> 01:21:23.300\nthe landscape of Los Angeles.\n\n01:21:23.300 --> 01:21:26.700\nAngela Poller is Elron Hubbard.\n\n01:21:26.700 --> 01:21:29.220\nSo we have two different views on this.\n\n01:21:29.220 --> 01:21:31.220\nTwo different views.\n\n01:21:31.220 --> 01:21:34.740\nIf Poller believes aliens created Improv.\n\n01:21:34.740 --> 01:21:38.060\nBetter Elron Hubbard than UNICEF, right?\n\n01:21:38.060 --> 01:21:39.900\nXeon, what's his name?\n\n01:21:39.900 --> 01:21:41.900\nXenu.\n\n01:21:41.900 --> 01:21:43.740\nHave you guys been to the Xenu Marathon?\n\n01:21:43.740 --> 01:21:46.820\nThe Xenu Improv Marathon?\n\n01:21:46.820 --> 01:21:50.140\nIt's 24 hours of Xenu Improv.\n\n01:21:50.140 --> 01:21:51.060\nYou can't don't miss it.\n\n01:21:51.060 --> 01:21:54.660\nRob Riggle just fucking crushes it.\n\n01:21:54.660 --> 01:21:56.820\nThey put a volcano on the cover of Dianetics.\n\n01:21:56.820 --> 01:21:57.980\nI was just looking at one.\n\n01:21:57.980 --> 01:22:01.420\nIn LA, we have probably more billboards for shit than you do.\n\n01:22:01.420 --> 01:22:04.980\nIn LA, people are like, that sounds good.\n\n01:22:04.980 --> 01:22:07.860\nIn New York, it's like, get the fuck out of my way.\n\n01:22:07.860 --> 01:22:10.860\nToday, a lady tried to give me a thing.\n\n01:22:10.860 --> 01:22:12.340\nNo one in LA walks.\n\n01:22:12.340 --> 01:22:13.940\nThat's a fair observation.\n\n01:22:13.940 --> 01:22:15.700\nBut in New York, when you walk down the street,\n\n01:22:15.700 --> 01:22:17.740\npeople are always trying to hand you shit, right?\n\n01:22:17.740 --> 01:22:19.540\nHow many people in here have ever been like, oh, yes.\n\n01:22:19.540 --> 01:22:20.860\nI'd like that.\n\n01:22:20.860 --> 01:22:23.060\nYou're like, get the fuck out of my way.\n\n01:22:23.060 --> 01:22:24.860\nIt always makes me think, again, an airplane,\n\n01:22:24.860 --> 01:22:26.740\nlike when you just fucking snap people's necks.\n\n01:22:26.740 --> 01:22:28.660\nYou know, the guy's walking in the airport and is like,\n\n01:22:28.660 --> 01:22:30.740\nall right, Chris, he's just fucking killing people.\n\n01:22:30.740 --> 01:22:31.580\nThat's what I wanted to do.\n\n01:22:31.580 --> 01:22:32.540\nLike, do you know the dolphins?\n\n01:22:32.540 --> 01:22:34.260\nI'm like, crack, you know?\n\n01:22:34.260 --> 01:22:35.420\nAnd I like dolphins.\n\n01:22:35.420 --> 01:22:37.020\nI just want to kill that lady.\n\n01:22:37.020 --> 01:22:37.860\nYou know what I mean?\n\n01:22:37.860 --> 01:22:40.140\nI will then go home and donate to the dolphin cause.\n\n01:22:40.140 --> 01:22:41.300\nI'm all for the cause.\n\n01:22:41.300 --> 01:22:42.860\nIt's just her talking to me on the street.\n\n01:22:42.860 --> 01:22:45.100\nYou wish there was a way to accidentally eat her\n\n01:22:45.100 --> 01:22:45.900\nwith a sandwich.\n\n01:22:45.900 --> 01:22:47.340\nYes, exactly.\n\n01:22:47.340 --> 01:22:49.540\nIt's really her.\n\n01:22:49.540 --> 01:22:51.580\nSometimes humans ruin it for the dolphins, I guess,\n\n01:22:51.580 --> 01:22:52.620\nis what I'm saying, guys.\n\n01:22:52.620 --> 01:22:53.980\nWell, that's, yeah, that's probably true.\n\n01:22:53.980 --> 01:22:54.820\nHave you?\n\n01:22:54.820 --> 01:22:59.100\nBut in addition to loving puns and generally being atheists,\n\n01:22:59.100 --> 01:23:01.740\nmy audience, who I love very much,\n\n01:23:01.740 --> 01:23:04.660\nWhat, you're really scared of losing them, huh?\n\n01:23:04.660 --> 01:23:05.500\nI love them.\n\n01:23:05.500 --> 01:23:06.340\nI love them.\n\n01:23:06.340 --> 01:23:07.180\nAnd I ate a lot of caviar.\n\n01:23:07.180 --> 01:23:08.020\nI made them dinner tonight.\n\n01:23:08.020 --> 01:23:08.860\nThey're the best.\n\n01:23:08.860 --> 01:23:09.700\nThey're young.\n\n01:23:09.700 --> 01:23:10.540\nThey're cool.\n\n01:23:10.540 --> 01:23:11.380\nUCB is the greatest.\n\n01:23:11.380 --> 01:23:12.220\nHowever.\n\n01:23:12.220 --> 01:23:13.060\nHowever.\n\n01:23:13.060 --> 01:23:14.860\nNow you know the answer why he got the job.\n\n01:23:14.860 --> 01:23:15.940\nCause he has like followers.\n\n01:23:15.940 --> 01:23:17.100\nAnd I keep being like, how about this?\n\n01:23:17.100 --> 01:23:18.420\nYou guys are all fucking loose.\n\n01:23:18.420 --> 01:23:22.220\nAnd then they're like, you know what you're doing?\n\n01:23:22.220 --> 01:23:23.340\nYou're alienating the crap.\n\n01:23:23.340 --> 01:23:26.180\nBut they're fucking loose.\n\n01:23:26.180 --> 01:23:29.060\nYou're not even connecting those dots.\n\n01:23:29.060 --> 01:23:30.660\nYou're not developing a group of people\n\n01:23:30.660 --> 01:23:31.740\nwho are interested in what you have to say.\n\n01:23:31.740 --> 01:23:33.660\nCause they're all like.\n\n01:23:33.660 --> 01:23:34.780\nThat might be an important thing\n\n01:23:34.780 --> 01:23:35.860\nto have been said to me.\n\n01:23:35.860 --> 01:23:37.740\nLike I didn't, I didn't connect this.\n\n01:23:37.740 --> 01:23:38.580\nI should try.\n\n01:23:38.580 --> 01:23:39.780\nI'm obsessed with like not,\n\n01:23:39.780 --> 01:23:43.540\nI think cause I like, I have a terrible, terrible like fear\n\n01:23:43.540 --> 01:23:46.740\nof like that at any minute, everyone's gonna go like,\n\n01:23:46.740 --> 01:23:47.580\nyou're.\n\n01:23:47.580 --> 01:23:48.420\nNo, you're in.\n\n01:23:48.420 --> 01:23:49.260\nYou're out.\n\n01:23:49.260 --> 01:23:51.940\nAnd it doesn't, but it's not a logic-based thing.\n\n01:23:51.940 --> 01:23:53.380\nSo it's like, it's an emotional thing.\n\n01:23:53.380 --> 01:23:55.460\nSo like, you know, the reason gay people don't like being\n\n01:23:55.460 --> 01:23:58.180\ncalled fags is not because they're like, am I, am I a bad?\n\n01:23:58.180 --> 01:24:00.740\nHow do we get, how do we get to here?\n\n01:24:00.740 --> 01:24:01.860\nI feel like we were all with you.\n\n01:24:01.860 --> 01:24:03.820\nAnd then you're like, that's why fags are fags.\n\n01:24:03.820 --> 01:24:05.980\nIt's like, wait, what?\n\n01:24:05.980 --> 01:24:06.980\nI think you misheard me.\n\n01:24:06.980 --> 01:24:09.420\nYou're like, that's why the Jews fucking run the economy.\n\n01:24:09.420 --> 01:24:11.220\nYou know, I was like, wow, hold on.\n\n01:24:11.220 --> 01:24:13.180\nThat's, that's how they all do it, Dan.\n\n01:24:13.180 --> 01:24:14.020\nThat's how they run.\n\n01:24:14.020 --> 01:24:17.220\nWe have latent like, like, like memories of like the first\n\n01:24:17.220 --> 01:24:19.700\ntime we were ever genuinely terrified that it was possible\n\n01:24:19.700 --> 01:24:23.420\nto be excommunicated basically from the, from the monkey tree\n\n01:24:23.420 --> 01:24:27.180\nand lose our figs and lose our ability to, to, to be.\n\n01:24:27.180 --> 01:24:30.980\nWe would start fires like primates die on their own to 1835.\n\n01:24:30.980 --> 01:24:32.940\nYou just wanted all the fires started.\n\n01:24:32.940 --> 01:24:34.500\nWe never, we never got, but you are right.\n\n01:24:34.500 --> 01:24:37.420\nIt's like a little, it's like, yeah, it's an obsession with me.\n\n01:24:37.420 --> 01:24:39.700\nLike it's, it's, it's like, like I really always want to like,\n\n01:24:39.700 --> 01:24:42.940\nI want to, I want to endure myself and it's a little wasted\n\n01:24:42.940 --> 01:24:44.780\nsometimes because like, look at me.\n\n01:24:44.780 --> 01:24:47.020\nI look like somebody that hates everybody.\n\n01:24:47.020 --> 01:24:47.940\nBut that's why you're charming.\n\n01:24:47.940 --> 01:24:49.740\nI probably do hate everybody.\n\n01:24:49.740 --> 01:24:51.580\nCan I give us, can we give you a minute just for Dan?\n\n01:24:51.580 --> 01:24:54.780\nStop sticking up for me because that makes me up for Dan.\n\n01:24:54.780 --> 01:24:56.380\nI want to stick up for Dan.\n\n01:24:56.380 --> 01:24:59.940\nDan is the fucking definition of the fucking dude.\n\n01:24:59.940 --> 01:25:01.620\nYou're all, you're like the guy,\n\n01:25:01.620 --> 01:25:05.780\nand here's the joke about it though, Dan is the fucking definition\n\n01:25:05.780 --> 01:25:06.780\nof a fucking dude.\n\n01:25:06.780 --> 01:25:07.620\nYeah.\n\n01:25:07.620 --> 01:25:08.900\nYou know what the dude is.\n\n01:25:08.900 --> 01:25:11.620\nYou've seen, you know, the dude, he's the dude.\n\n01:25:11.620 --> 01:25:14.980\nAnd it's like the thing where like, he doesn't know he's cool,\n\n01:25:14.980 --> 01:25:17.540\nwhich is why we're all like, you're fucking cool.\n\n01:25:17.540 --> 01:25:18.380\nYou know what I mean?\n\n01:25:18.380 --> 01:25:19.820\nAnd then like, if

01:25:24.020\nYou know what I mean?\n\n01:25:24.020 --> 01:25:24.860\nYou're bad at it.\n\n01:25:24.860 --> 01:25:25.700\nYou're not fooling me.\n\n01:25:25.700 --> 01:25:27.220\nI know I'm going to step off stage and be like, wait,\n\n01:25:27.220 --> 01:25:28.700\nwhat did he say?\n\n01:25:28.700 --> 01:25:29.780\nNo, I haven't listened at all.\n\n01:25:29.780 --> 01:25:32.300\nHe just said, I was, I mean, then I was a thing.\n\n01:25:32.300 --> 01:25:34.580\nYou said you may or may not hate people.\n\n01:25:34.580 --> 01:25:35.420\nI do.\n\n01:25:35.420 --> 01:25:36.780\nYeah, I

lot\n\n01:25:44.140 --> 01:25:45.740\nbecause it's like, it turns into.\n\n01:25:45.740 --> 01:25:47.860\nHow much money you get from a sitcom?\n\n01:25:47.860 --> 01:25:49.620\nLet me just say this late night fucking,\n\n01:25:49.620 --> 01:25:51.340\nI wear the same pants a lot.\n\n01:25:51.340 --> 01:25:52.180\nYou know what I mean?\n\n01:25:52.180 --> 01:25:54.540\nWell, did you, I mean, did

class.\n\n01:25:57.980 --> 01:26:00.300\nI'm telling you, if I farted like that,\n\n01:26:00.300 --> 01:26:02.980\nmy dad wouldn't have been like, I'm proud of you.\n\n01:26:02.980 -->

mean, when you create a sitcom,\n\n01:26:11.020 --> 01:26:13.180\nlike did you come here and like the Dan Hormann Express,\n\n01:26:13.180 --> 01:26:14.300\nlike some fucking thing?\n\n01:26:14.300 --> 01:26:16.660\nNo, but I like zipline, do you zipline places?\n\n01:26:16.660 --> 01:26:17.500\nI guess is what I mean.\n\n01:26:17.500 --> 01:26:18.340\nI don't.\n\n01:26:18.340 --> 01:26:20.140\nI never do a place where I can zipline anywhere.\n\n01:26:20.140 --> 01:26:21.620\nI haven't gotten to the zipline phase yet.\n\n01:26:21.620 --> 01:26:22.620\nYou haven't.\n\n01:26:22.620 --> 01:26:25.340\nBecause, you know, like Chuck Lorre, who created the two and a half men,\n\n01:26:25.340 --> 01:26:28.020\nhe ziplines all across America.\n\n01:26:28.020 --> 01:26:28.900\nThat's his true story.\n\n01:26:28.900 --> 01:26:30.060\nNo, he could he fly?\n\n01:26:30.060 --> 01:26:31.060\nHe seems so inconvenient.\n\n01:26:31.060 --> 01:26:31.820\nCould he fly?\n\n01:26:31.820 --> 01:26:32.420\nYes.\n\n01:26:32.420 --> 01:26:33.500\nDoes he choose zipline?\n\n01:26:33.500 --> 01:26:34.220\nAbsolutely.\n\n01:26:34.220 --> 01:26:36.660\nHe has a series of, he has a series of wires,\n\n01:26:36.660 --> 01:26:37.820\nand he just, series of wires.\n\n01:26:37.820 --> 01:26:39.140\nHe leaves, he leaves Warner Brothers.\n\n01:26:39.140 --> 01:26:40.620\nHigher than the poor people can see.\n\n01:26:40.620 --> 01:26:43.260\nHe leaves Warner Brothers.\n\n01:26:43.260 --> 01:26:44.860\nIt's out of poor vision.\n\n01:26:44.860 --> 01:26:46.660\nPoor people can only see one mile.\n\n01:26:46.660 --> 01:26:49.220\nBecause of malnutrition.\n\n01:26:49.220 --> 01:26:51.660\nBecause you guys think you don't enjoy carrots.\n\n01:26:51.660 --> 01:26:54.260\nThe food supply, guys, because of the food supply,\n\n01:26:54.260 --> 01:26:56.500\nyou can only see one mile into the sky.\n\n01:26:56.500 --> 01:26:58.700\nFucking Chuck Lorre, mile and a half up,\n\n01:26:58.700 --> 01:27:00.420\nget a whole city.\n\n01:27:00.420 --> 01:27:03.100\nIt's like the Ewok Village, but it's just,\n\n01:27:03.100 --> 01:27:05.660\nit's just show creators up there, guys.\n\n01:27:05.660 --> 01:27:08.700\nThe late night people, I once was invited to like a party\n\n01:27:08.700 --> 01:27:12.020\nat one house, but like, the fucking gods who create the shit,\n\n01:27:12.020 --> 01:27:13.540\nthey're like fucking zipline all over.\n\n01:27:13.540 --> 01:27:15.380\nIf you say, if Chuck Lorre comes over to your house,\n\n01:27:15.380 --> 01:27:16.980\nhe said, you want to write home, he's like, no, I'm good.\n\n01:27:16.980 --> 01:27:18.500\nAnd he walks, he climbs the tree,\n\n01:27:18.500 --> 01:27:20.540\nthrows his belt over, and the fucking thing.\n\n01:27:20.540 --> 01:27:21.380\nYes.\n\n01:27:21.380 --> 01:27:22.980\nAnd it's like, here's what's weird.\n\n01:27:22.980 --> 01:27:24.940\nWhy would he have to climb a tree?\n\n01:27:24.940 --> 01:27:25.940\nYou know what I mean?\n\n01:27:25.940 --> 01:27:27.900\nLike, with that much money, but he prefers it.\n\n01:27:27.900 --> 01:27:31.580\nBecause he feels like any pussy can get a fucking ride.\n\n01:27:31.580 --> 01:27:32.900\nYou know what I mean to the zipline?\n\n01:27:32.900 --> 01:27:35.140\nWhat do you mean, how would you get up?\n\n01:27:35.140 --> 01:27:37.100\nI don't know, fucking zipline escalator.\n\n01:27:37.100 --> 01:27:38.260\nI don't know.\n\n01:27:38.260 --> 01:27:40.660\nThat's why I don't have a fucking sitcom.\n\n01:27:40.660 --> 01:27:41.860\nYou know what I mean?\n\n01:27:41.860 --> 01:27:44.300\nThe late night world is just fucking\n\n01:27:44.300 --> 01:27:46.060\na powered walkways like at the airport.\n\n01:27:46.060 --> 01:27:50.180\nSpencer, if you get a zipline from one location\n\n01:27:50.180 --> 01:27:52.300\nto another location, like it could be from your house\n\n01:27:52.300 --> 01:27:53.620\nto a certain restaurant, you're like,\n\n01:27:53.620 --> 01:27:55.300\nfor one place to another, it could be anywhere\n\n01:27:55.300 --> 01:27:56.140\nacross the planet.\n\n01:27:56.140 --> 01:27:59.140\nYou can go from Dungeons to Dragons.\n\n01:27:59.140 --> 01:28:01.740\nThat's the most distance you get anywhere.\n\n01:28:01.740 --> 01:28:04.500\nThat's right.\n\n01:28:04.500 --> 01:28:05.900\nWhere would you zipline from?\n\n01:28:05.900 --> 01:28:08.740\nAnd if you had one zipline that was always available to you.\n\n01:28:08.740 --> 01:28:11.260\nI definitely started in Baton Rouge.\n\n01:28:14.100 --> 01:28:15.460\nA fine choice.\n\n01:28:15.460 --> 01:28:17.420\nA fine choice.\n\n01:28:17.420 --> 01:28:20.180\nAnd then you got like a fucking basket full of crawfish.\n\n01:28:20.180 --> 01:28:21.660\nAnd you're like, I'm zipline.\n\n01:28:21.660 --> 01:28:24.180\nI'm zipline into Canada.\n\n01:28:24.180 --> 01:28:25.180\nOK.\n\n01:28:25.180 --> 01:28:26.620\nThey'll appreciate this.\n\n01:28:26.620 --> 01:28:32.780\nNobody will dispute your choice to start in Baton Rouge.\n\n01:28:32.780 --> 01:28:34.180\nWhere is your destination?\n\n01:28:34.180 --> 01:28:36.020\nI was going to say Toronto.\n\n01:28:39.020 --> 01:28:40.220\nOf course.\n\n01:28:40.220 --> 01:28:46.300\nYou can't get, you can bring jazz and crawfish to the north.\n\n01:28:46.300 --> 01:28:47.660\nAnd you won't get a zipline.\n\n01:28:47.660 --> 01:28:48.660\nHere I come.\n\n01:28:48.660 --> 01:28:50.140\nHey, guys.\n\n01:28:50.140 --> 01:28:52.740\nAnd you eat crawdaddies just playing the trombone.\n\n01:28:52.740 --> 01:28:54.940\nHey, guys, I got loads of crawdaddies.\n\n01:28:54.940 --> 01:28:58.060\nBut I could also use some Greek food in Toronto.\n\n01:28:58.060 --> 01:29:00.900\nEverybody's so busy trying to be better than each other.\n\n01:29:00.900 --> 01:29:02.700\nNo one's focused on where would I\n\n01:29:02.700 --> 01:29:05.420\nbe really useful in a way that's attainable.\n\n01:29:05.420 --> 01:29:08.540\nBe the seafood king of Toronto.\n\n01:29:08.540 --> 01:29:11.620\nBe its primary supplier of shellfish.\n\n01:29:11.620 --> 01:29:16.180\nI also like the sub-economy of zipline wire transfer guys.\n\n01:29:16.180 --> 01:29:17.540\nWe'll have to sit up at the zipline\n\n01:29:17.540 --> 01:29:19.540\nand be like, where are you headed, north?\n\n01:29:19.540 --> 01:29:21.020\nYou know what I mean?\n\n01:29:21.020 --> 01:29:22.540\nI think they're like Chuck Lorre.\n\n01:29:22.540 --> 01:29:23.820\nThey're like Chuck Lorre, you've got to wait.\n\n01:29:23.820 --> 01:29:25.540\nThe guys who created Cheers are ahead of you.\n\n01:29:25.540 --> 01:29:26.700\nYou know what I mean?\n\n01:29:26.700 --> 01:29:28.060\nThey're on their way to Florida.\n\n01:29:28.060 --> 01:29:29.260\nStarting point destination.\n\n01:29:29.260 --> 01:29:31.420\nWhere's your starting point destination?\n\n01:29:31.420 --> 01:29:32.700\nHow far does zipline go?\n\n01:29:32.700 --> 01:29:34.580\nIt could go all the way around the world if you'd like.\n\n01:29:34.580 --> 01:29:35.380\nThe whole world.\n\n01:29:35.380 --> 01:29:36.620\nYeah, not the moon.\n\n01:29:36.620 --> 01:29:37.260\nIt should be.\n\n01:29:37.260 --> 01:29:38.660\nWell, the moon's not in the world.\n\n01:29:38.660 --> 01:29:40.020\nI don't want to be a dick.\n\n01:29:40.020 --> 01:29:41.900\nI'd say.\n\n01:29:41.900 --> 01:29:42.460\nI love that.\n\n01:29:42.460 --> 01:29:45.380\nAnywhere in America except the moon.\n\n01:29:45.380 --> 01:29:48.820\nI know we put a flag in it, but we don't own it.\n\n01:29:48.820 --> 01:29:50.700\nIt could be just like a rock in there.\n\n01:29:50.700 --> 01:29:51.660\nIt could be Istanbul.\n\n01:29:51.660 --> 01:29:52.420\nIt could be Saigon.\n\n01:29:52.420 --> 01:29:54.020\nIt could be Brisbane.\n\n01:29:54.020 --> 01:29:55.460\nIt could be wherever you like.\n\n01:29:55.460 --> 01:29:57.340\nWow, you just named places.\n\n01:29:59.780 --> 01:30:01.780\nI would say it's, I mean, I would start in New York\n\n01:30:01.780 --> 01:30:02.980\njust because that's where I live.\n\n01:30:02.980 --> 01:30:05.220\nAnd then I would go to.\n\n01:30:05.220 --> 01:30:06.380\nYou only get one zipline.\n\n01:30:06.380 --> 01:30:07.660\nYou could zip anywhere you want.\n\n01:30:07.660 --> 01:30:09.980\nAnd then I got to live there forever?\n\n01:30:09.980 --> 01:30:11.940\nNo, you could zip back and forth.\n\n01:30:11.940 --> 01:30:14.060\nOh, but I can't like zip to multiple locations.\n\n01:30:14.060 --> 01:30:18.020\nNo, you get one, I think you get one zipline start.\n\n01:30:18.020 --> 01:30:19.300\nThat's a really good question.\n\n01:30:19.300 --> 01:30:22.300\nSpencer very controversially picked Baton Rouge in Toronto.\n\n01:30:25.300 --> 01:30:26.700\nVery pragmatically.\n\n01:30:26.700 --> 01:30:30.420\nYeah, by the way, the internet's fucking shit's trending right now.\n\n01:30:30.420 --> 01:30:32.860\nThat's such a Reddit answer.\n\n01:30:32.860 --> 01:30:35.100\nIt's like, I figured it out.\n\n01:30:35.100 --> 01:30:38.780\nThis is the best way to use a zipline.\n\n01:30:38.780 --> 01:30:45.380\nI will have $8 million in three years, and then 900 guys\n\n01:30:45.380 --> 01:30:47.300\nquestioning it, but then just watching.\n\n01:30:47.300 --> 01:30:49.740\nA top Reddit thread is just if the original poster is just\n\n01:30:49.740 --> 01:30:52.540\nlike, chop, chop, chop, all the peer review.\n\n01:30:52.540 --> 01:30:54.700\nWell, actually, wasn't that, pshah, actually, pshah.\n\n01:30:54.700 --> 01:30:57.420\nNo, fucking do your math.\n\n01:30:57.420 --> 01:30:58.420\nDo your math.\n\n01:30:58.420 --> 01:31:00.300\nI love the idea.\n\n01:31:00.300 --> 01:31:02.060\nI love the trend.\n\n01:31:02.060 --> 01:31:03.100\nIt would have gone good there.\n\n01:31:03.100 --> 01:31:05.260\nI love the trend right now that it's just fucking like,\n\n01:31:05.260 --> 01:31:07.300\nit's like Toronto, Spencer, question mark,\n\n01:31:07.300 --> 01:31:08.460\nlike you're in a boy band.\n\n01:31:08.460 --> 01:31:09.620\nYou know what I mean?\n\n01:31:09.620 --> 01:31:11.340\nSo, Rory, you start in New York.\n\n01:31:11.340 --> 01:31:12.740\nIt's one direction.\n\n01:31:12.740 --> 01:31:13.900\nYou're starting in New York.\n\n01:31:13.900 --> 01:31:14.820\nStarting in New York.\n\n01:31:14.820 --> 01:31:16.260\nYou get to zip to one place.\n\n01:31:16.260 --> 01:31:17.860\nI would probably zip to like Brazil.\n\n01:31:17.860 --> 01:31:19.380\nZip?\n\n01:31:19.380 --> 01:31:20.660\nThat's a whole fucking country.\n\n01:31:20.660 --> 01:31:22.260\nI know, but where's the place where all those fucking\n\n01:31:22.260 --> 01:31:23.300\ntitties are mouncin'?\n\n01:31:23.300 --> 01:31:24.140\nYou know what I mean?\n\n01:31:24.140 --> 01:31:25.220\nThat's all I know about Brazil.\n\n01:31:25.220 --> 01:31:26.700\nOur mountain?\n\n01:31:26.700 --> 01:31:27.820\nNo, bouncy titties.\n\n01:31:27.820 --> 01:31:33.060\nThe fact that you can't name a city in Brazil, man,\n\n01:31:33.060 --> 01:31:34.260\nyou're not qualified to zip.\n\n01:31:34.260 --> 01:31:36.980\nYeah, Rio de Jatiti.\n\n01:31:36.980 --> 01:31:38.740\nYou want a zip line to Rio de Janeiro?\n\n01:31:38.740 --> 01:31:41.260\nI understand that Rio is such a fucked up place\n\n01:31:41.260 --> 01:31:43.580\nthat rich people have to travel via air\n\n01:31:43.580 --> 01:31:44.900\nfrom building to building and shit.\n\n01:31:44.900 --> 01:31:45.740\nThey can't go to the ground.\n\n01:31:45.740 --> 01:31:46.580\nIt's called zip lines, man.\n\n01:31:46.580 --> 01:31:49.260\nSo what I'm saying is I would fucking zip into Rio,\n\n01:31:49.260 --> 01:31:52.620\nfucking zip up some Rio titties, and then I'd zip out.\n\n01:31:52.620 --> 01:31:54.300\nNo, because you have a zip line, too.\n\n01:31:54.300 --> 01:31:54.860\nI get it, guys.\n\n01:31:54.860 --> 01:31:55.900\nPretty controversial.\n\n01:31:55.900 --> 01:31:58.820\nSo human trafficking, you'd use your zip line.\n\n01:31:58.820 --> 01:32:00.860\nHey, hey, you know what?\n\n01:32:00.860 --> 01:32:03.340\nHow the ladies get there's not my problem.\n\n01:32:03.340 --> 01:32:04.460\nI just use zip lines.\n\n01:32:04.460 --> 01:32:06.380\nMoney don't know where it came from, you understand?\n\n01:32:06.380 --> 01:32:07.980\nI have enough money for a zip line.\n\n01:32:07.980 --> 01:32:09.980\nYou don't worry about the fucking route of the problem.\n\n01:32:09.980 --> 01:32:12.820\nI'm disturbed by the fact zip lines don't human traffic.\n\n01:32:12.820 --> 01:32:16.060\nHumans human traffic.\n\n01:32:16.060 --> 01:32:17.420\nExactly.\n\n01:32:17.420 --> 01:32:19.340\nGuys, you don't make enough money to zip line\n\n01:32:19.340 --> 01:32:21.020\nto worry about your peasant problems.\n\n01:32:21.020 --> 01:32:21.820\nYou know what I mean?\n\n01:32:21.820 --> 01:32:25.100\nDan, zip lines start and destination.\n\n01:32:25.100 --> 01:32:28.460\nWell, start's tough because you guys are questioning.\n\n01:32:28.460 --> 01:32:29.860\nWe're going to make Ali at Aliyah.\n\n01:32:29.860 --> 01:32:31.580\nYou guys have picked two places.\n\n01:32:31.580 --> 01:32:32.980\nYou could live in Los Angeles.\n\n01:32:32.980 --> 01:32:33.980\nYou could live in New York.\n\n01:32:33.980 --> 01:32:36.540\nYou could have a zip line between two other destinations\n\n01:32:36.540 --> 01:32:40.060\nthat you have at your leisure to zip back and forth.\n\n01:32:40.060 --> 01:32:41.220\nLike, you just take off your belt,\n\n01:32:41.220 --> 01:32:42.580\nthrow it over the wire, and it goes Zoom,\n\n01:32:42.580 --> 01:32:43.580\nand you're fucking.\n\n01:32:43.580 --> 01:32:46.380\nCan't there be a more comfortable way to go?\n\n01:32:46.380 --> 01:32:47.380\nI don't want to be a drag.\n\n01:32:47.380 --> 01:32:48.940\nCan't there be like a first class zip?\n\n01:32:48.940 --> 01:32:49.980\nI don't want to use my belt.\n\n01:32:49.980 --> 01:32:51.500\nI think you have a belt.\n\n01:32:51.500 --> 01:32:53.340\nYou just, you just James Bond it.\n\n01:32:53.340 --> 01:32:54.340\nThat's it?\n\n01:32:54.340 --> 01:32:56.700\nBecause I just want to be, I don't want to be a dick,\n\n01:32:56.700 --> 01:32:57.820\nbut bad roots at Toronto.\n\n01:32:57.820 --> 01:32:59.940\nThat's a lot of bell holding.\n\n01:32:59.940 --> 01:33:01.700\nYeah, you didn't specify that.\n\n01:33:01.700 --> 01:33:02.860\nI feel like you just get the man in a chair.\n\n01:33:02.860 --> 01:33:03.860\nI'm going to fuck.\n\n01:33:03.860 --> 01:33:04.860\nMy hands are getting tired.\n\n01:33:04.860 --> 01:33:05.860\nYou're not.\n\n01:33:05.860 --> 01:33:06.860\nYou're not.\n\n01:33:06.860 --> 01:33:07.860\nYou're not.\n\n01:33:07.860 --> 01:33:08.860\nThere's no wrong way to zip line.\n\n01:33:08.860 --> 01:33:09.860\nI feel like by the time I end New Jersey, I'm dead.\n\n01:33:09.860 --> 01:33:10.860\nThat's not.\n\n01:33:10.860 --> 01:33:11.860\nI can't.\n\n01:33:11.860 --> 01:33:12.860\nI can't.\n\n01:33:12.860 --> 01:33:13.860\nYou're not even talking.\n\n01:33:13.860 --> 01:33:14.860\nI can't carry a basket of crap.\n\n01:33:14.860 --> 01:33:15.860\nMy fingers are bleeding.\n\n01:33:15.860 --> 01:33:16.860\nI'm exhausted.\n\n01:33:16.860 --> 01:33:17.860\nI'm exhausted.\n\n01:33:17.860 --> 01:33:18.860\nI'm sitting on a stool right now.\n\n01:33:18.860 --> 01:33:19.860\nLet's not get hung up on how you zip line.\n\n01:33:19.860 --> 01:33:20.860\nYou're talking about a rope here.\n\n01:33:20.860 --> 01:33:22.860\nThis isn't a zip line at all.\n\n01:33:22.860 --> 01:33:23.860\nHuh?\n\n01:33:23.860 --> 01:33:24.860\nYeah.\n\n01:33:24.860 --> 01:33:25.860\nYou're talking about like different,\n\n01:33:25.860 --> 01:33:26.860\nyou're talking about bank robberies.\n\n01:33:26.860 --> 01:33:27.860\nLook, you guys.\n\n01:33:27.860 --> 01:33:29.860\nThat's a different kind of zip lining.\n\n01:33:29.860 --> 01:33:32.860\nOh, the belt is, yeah, the belt is an ad hoc zip line.\n\n01:33:32.860 --> 01:33:34.860\nYeah, this is some action adventure.\n\n01:33:34.860 --> 01:33:36.860\nThis is a comfort class kind of thing.\n\n01:33:36.860 --> 01:33:40.860\nIf you want to go to one place to another easily, zoom, starting where?\n\n01:33:40.860 --> 01:33:42.860\nThis is a theme park grade zip line.\n\n01:33:42.860 --> 01:33:44.860\nI'm talking about like you're sitting in a Shaw Walker chair.\n\n01:33:44.860 --> 01:33:46.860\nCan I ask one more question?\n\n01:33:46.860 --> 01:33:47.860\nCertainly.\n\n01:33:47.860 --> 01:33:48.860\nYou know, I'm watching Furious 7.\n\n01:33:48.860 --> 01:33:49.860\nBefore I make Furious 7.\n\n01:33:49.860 --> 01:33:51.860\nYou know, the best of the Furious franchise.\n\n01:33:51.860 --> 01:33:58.860\nCan, is there, can we assume that there's such a thing as a cargo capacity?\n\n01:33:58.860 --> 01:34:00.860\nLike, could I, could I travel?\n\n01:34:00.860 --> 01:34:04.860\nCould I, could I pretend he needs his dog to fly?\n\n01:34:04.860 --> 01:34:05.860\nYou get 500.\n\n01:34:05.860 --> 01:34:06.860\nI want to bring my dogs.\n\n01:34:06.860 --> 01:34:07.860\n500 pounds cargo.\n\n01:34:07.860 --> 01:34:08.860\nYou get 500 pounds.\n\n01:34:08.860 --> 01:34:09.860\n500 pounds.\n\n01:34:09.860 --> 01:34:10.860\nOkay.\n\n01:34:10.860 --> 01:34:11.860\nPortland.\n\n01:34:11.860 --> 01:34:12.860\nOregon.\n\n01:34:12.860 --> 01:34:13.860\nOkay.\n\n01:34:13.860 --> 01:34:14.860\nStarting or ending?\n\n01:34:14.860 --> 01:34:15.860\nI'm going there.\n\n01:34:15.860 --> 01:34:16.860\nThe question doesn't.\n\n01:34:16.860 --> 01:34:18.860\nYou get a starting location and an ending location.\n\n01:34:18.860 --> 01:34:19.860\nIt's a one way zip line.\n\n01:34:19.860 --> 01:34:21.860\nOh, you can't, you have to walk back.\n\n01:34:21.860 --> 01:34:23.860\nIt's elevation based.\n\n01:34:23.860 --> 01:34:25.860\nYou have to zip down.\n\n01:34:25.860 --> 01:34:29.860\nYou got to take, you have to take a Peter Pan bus home.\n\n01:34:29.860 --> 01:34:30.860\nThat's the only caveat.\n\n01:34:30.860 --> 01:34:31.860\nThat's right.\n\n01:34:31.860 --> 01:34:32.860\nThat's why I said Chuck Lorre had the climate freak.\n\n01:34:32.860 --> 01:34:35.860\nYou can't one way zip line and then Peter Pan home.\n\n01:34:35.860 --> 01:34:37.860\nHey, it's called zip line bro.\n\n01:34:37.860 --> 01:34:39.860\nLike, and live it and live it or don't.\n\n01:34:39.860 --> 01:34:40.860\nYou know what I mean?\n\n01:34:40.860 --> 01:34:41.860\nHey, I'm not Chuck Lorre.\n\n01:34:41.860 --> 01:34:42.860\nI didn't invent this shit.\n\n01:34:42.860 --> 01:34:45.860\nThat's why Chuck Lorre has the climate freak.\n\n01:34:45.860 --> 01:34:46.860\nBlame Chuck Lorre, bro.\n\n01:34:46.860 --> 01:34:50.860\nThat's why it's got a half a man on that show.\n\n01:34:50.860 --> 01:34:52.860\nYou can just start to play zip line.\n\n01:34:52.860 --> 01:34:53.860\nBoom.\n\n01:34:53.860 --> 01:34:54.860\nYou go.\n\n01:34:54.860 --> 01:34:55.860\nThere's bonds.\n\n01:34:55.860 --> 01:34:56.860\nYou're at end of this.\n\n01:34:56.860 --> 01:35:00.860\nSo then I'm picking a place that I want to be able to get in a hurry.\n\n01:35:00.860 --> 01:35:02.860\nYou get to communicate between two places.\n\n01:35:02.860 --> 01:35:03.860\nOkay.\n\n01:35:03.860 --> 01:35:04.860\nPortland.\n\n01:35:04.860 --> 01:35:05.860\nIs this starting or the ending?\n\n01:35:05.860 --> 01:35:06.860\nIf you're in LA, I'll give you an example.\n\n01:35:06.860 --> 01:35:12.860\nIf you're in LA and you want a zip line of Portland, it'll take you only like 37 hours\n\n01:35:12.860 --> 01:35:14.860\nholding a belt.\n\n01:35:14.860 --> 01:35:16.860\nOne and a half miles of the air.\n\n01:35:16.860 --> 01:35:19.860\nSo it's a pretty good way to travel to walk your dogs.\n\n01:35:19.860 --> 01:35:23.860\nCause I was just thinking partland, my dogs love partland, but it's like, wait a minute.\n\n01:35:23.860 --> 01:35:30.860\nTwo sons of a belt for 32 hours and hold your body weight up with no other harnesses.\n\n01:35:30.860 --> 01:35:34.860\nWhy are you being such a pussy, Dan?\n\n01:35:34.860 --> 01:35:36.860\nIt's like you hate traveling.\n\n01:35:36.860 --> 01:35:39.860\nWhy do you hate traveling so much, Dan?\n\n01:35:39.860 --> 01:35:41.860\nYou don't want to go to Portland, bro?\n\n01:35:41.860 --> 01:35:42.860\nWhatever.\n\n01:35:42.860 --> 01:35:46.860\nHey guys, if I was the host, I could have Portland.\n\n01:35:46.860 --> 01:35:50.860\nBy the way, I hold my shit up for 32 hours to entertain you people.\n\n01:35:50.860 --> 01:35:53.860\nNo, this guy.\n\n01:35:53.860 --> 01:35:54.860\nWhat?\n\n01:35:54.860 --> 01:35:55.860\nWhat's going on?\n\n01:35:55.860 --> 01:35:58.860\nSpencer did not hesitate on Baton Rouge in Toronto.\n\n01:35:58.860 --> 01:36:02.860\nBut we praised him for that only because of the assumption about a two-way...\n\n01:36:02.860 --> 01:36:03.860\nOh no, that's not...\n\n01:36:03.860 --> 01:36:04.860\nHe didn't know it was belt travel.\n\n01:36:04.860 --> 01:36:06.860\nYeah, I didn't know it was belt travel.\n\n01:36:06.860 --> 01:36:08.860\nHe said, just fucking don't get hung up on the belt.\n\n01:36:08.860 --> 01:36:10.860\nI was talking about ropes.\n\n01:36:10.860 --> 01:36:11.860\nThe belt's a big factor.\n\n01:36:11.860 --> 01:36:12.860\nOh, I mean, I...\n\n01:36:12.860 --> 01:36:13.860\nFuck, man.\n\n01:36:13.860 --> 01:36:14.860\nWhere else?\n\n01:36:14.860 --> 01:36:19.860\nWell, I retract Portland because I wanted to have like a pietta tear there where my dogs could play.\n\n01:36:19.860 --> 01:36:20.860\nAll right.\n\n01:36:20.860 --> 01:36:22.860\nDude, use Zipline with a couple of dogs.\n\n01:36:22.860 --> 01:36:23.860\nIt's pretty awesome.\n\n01:36:23.860 --> 01:36:28.860\nWhere does he have to hold the dogs or do the dogs hold their own belts?\n\n01:36:28.860 --> 01:36:29.860\nHe's got baby horns.\n\n01:36:29.860 --> 01:36:30.860\nI'm allowing him...\n\n01:36:30.860 --> 01:36:32.860\nI'm allowing his Zipline 500-pound cargo.\n\n01:36:32.860 --> 01:36:36.860\nDo you put like a fucking bacon kong on the end of a belt and a dog is...\n\n01:36:36.860 --> 01:36:37.860\nOkay.\n\n01:36:37.860 --> 01:36:38.860\nA dog just holds on.\n\n01:36:38.860 --> 01:36:40.860\nBut you're saying it's elevation-based?\n\n01:36:40.860 --> 01:36:41.860\nNo, I'm not saying that.\n\n01:36:41.860 --> 01:36:42.860\nI'm saying...\n\n01:36:42.860 --> 01:36:43.860\nI am.\n\n01:36:43.860 --> 01:36:44.860\nYou get to Zipline from wherever.\n\n01:36:44.860 --> 01:36:48.860\nWe might have to build a large tower so you can Zipline so the elevation works.\n\n01:36:48.860 --> 01:36:49.860\nNo.\n\n01:36:49.860 --> 01:36:50.860\nL.A. to Tokyo.\n\n01:36:50.860 --> 01:36:51.860\nOkay.\n\n01:36:51.860 --> 01:36:52.860\nLet me finish.\n\n01:36:52.860 --> 01:36:54.860\nI'm gonna use the money I make bringing...\n\n01:36:54.860 --> 01:36:55.860\nWhat are they like?\n\n01:36:55.860 --> 01:36:56.860\nBlue jeans?\n\n01:36:56.860 --> 01:36:57.860\nYeah, blue jeans.\n\n01:36:57.860 --> 01:36:58.860\nWhat's their...\n\n01:36:58.860 --> 01:36:59.860\nWhat's their crawdad?\n\n01:36:59.860 --> 01:37:00.860\nThey love blue jeans and Cadillacs.\n\n01:37:00.860 --> 01:37:01.860\nYou should bring a Cadillac.\n\n01:37:01.860 --> 01:37:03.860\nYou can Zipline a couple of Caddies.\n\n01:37:03.860 --> 01:37:04.860\nThey love...\n\n01:37:04.860 --> 01:37:05.860\nThey love sideburns.\n\n01:37:05.860 --> 01:37:07.860\nBuild another Zipline from Mount Fuji to L.A.\n\n01:37:07.860 --> 01:37:08.860\nHuh?\n\n01:37:08.860 --> 01:37:09.860\nMount Fuji.\n\n01:37:09.860 --> 01:37:11.860\nWait, you're going only for mercenary reasons?\n\n01:37:11.860 --> 01:37:12.860\nYeah.\n\n01:37:12.860 --> 01:37:13.860\nYou're going...\n\n01:37:13.860 --> 01:37:14.860\nYou mean merchandising?\n\n01:37:14.860 --> 01:37:15.860\nYeah.\n\n01:37:15.860 --> 01:37:18.860\nI'm a fucking merc!\n\n01:37:18.860 --> 01:37:20.860\nShe just came Zipline and didn't kill...\n\n01:37:20.860 --> 01:37:21.860\nOkay.\n\n01:37:21.860 --> 01:37:23.860\nI mean, back in the 40s, that was the move.\n\n01:37:23.860 --> 01:37:24.860\nYou know what I mean?\n\n01:37:24.860 --> 01:37:25.860\nBut now, nobody...\n\n01:37:25.860 --> 01:37:28.860\nI could use the word salarian, but you're going for financial interests?\n\n01:37:28.860 --> 01:37:31.860\nMercenary is what I meant, by the way.\n\n01:37:31.860 --> 01:37:33.860\nYeah, mercenary, I feel like...\n\n01:37:33.860 --> 01:37:35.860\nI feel like that connotates bloodshed.\n\n01:37:35.860 --> 01:37:39.860\nWell, I mean, you're perpetuating, first of all, the myth that it's possible to kill\n\n01:37:39.860 --> 01:37:41.860\na Japanese person, which it's not...\n\n01:37:41.860 --> 01:37:42.860\nWhich we found out...\n\n01:37:42.860 --> 01:37:43.860\nWhich we learned...\n\n01:37:43.860 --> 01:37:44.860\nWe fucking learned that hard way.\n\n01:37:44.860 --> 01:37:45.860\nIt's a lot of big weapons.\n\n01:37:45.860 --> 01:37:46.860\nIt is very difficult.\n\n01:37:46.860 --> 01:37:49.860\nI think the Baton Death March taught us a lesson or two on that.\n\n01:37:49.860 --> 01:37:50.860\nWell, by the way...\n\n01:37:50.860 --> 01:37:51.860\nWell, I didn't want to go...\n\n01:37:51.860 --> 01:37:52.860\nNothing worse than the Baton...\n\n01:37:52.860 --> 01:37:53.860\nDon't owe me on that, fucking...\n\n01:37:53.860 --> 01:37:58.860\nDon't get mixed up between the Baton Death March and the Baton Dime March, which is when...\n\n01:37:58.860 --> 01:38:00.860\nGuys, it's a callback.\n\n01:38:00.860 --> 01:38:02.860\nUNICEF, UNICEF, everybody.\n\n01:38:02.860 --> 01:38:03.860\nI honestly...\n\n01:38:03.860 --> 01:38:04.860\nI'm trying to wrap it up.\n\n01:38:04.860 --> 01:38:05.860\nI was Ziplining out.\n\n01:38:05.860 --> 01:38:09.860\nOnce you guys told me about the limitations where it's only one way...\n\n01:38:09.860 --> 01:38:11.860\nThey're asleep at this point.\n\n01:38:11.860 --> 01:38:20.860\nIt's just pumping fucking whatever LSD into the crowd right now.\n\n01:38:20.860 --> 01:38:26.860\nI'm obsessed with the idea that I need to overcome the limitations that I'm being fenced in by,\n\n01:38:26.860 --> 01:38:32.860\nbecause I'm thinking like, isn't Mount Fuji the highest elevated point somewhere outside...\n\n01:38:32.860 --> 01:38:36.860\nThe point is that you can't Zipline up hills, so you could start in a sense.\n\n01:38:36.860 --> 01:38:37.860\nBut you can't...\n\n01:38:37.860 --> 01:38:38.860\nWait, I'm saying it's my ending point.\n\n01:38:38.860 --> 01:38:41.860\nChuck Lorre, he can Zipline up hill.\n\n01:38:41.860 --> 01:38:43.860\nI'm not thinking about who invented this.\n\n01:38:43.860 --> 01:38:46.860\nChuck Lorre uses two Ziplines, one for each way.\n\n01:38:46.860 --> 01:38:49.860\nWhatever Chuck Lorre goes, any way he wants to go.\n\n01:38:49.860 --> 01:38:51.860\nYou guys are putting way too many parameters on Ziplining.\n\n01:38:51.860 --> 01:38:54.860\nI am a good host, and here's proof we're moving on.\n\n01:38:54.860 --> 01:38:55.860\nAll right.\n\n01:38:55.860 --> 01:38:57.860\nOh, shit.\n\n01:38:57.860 --> 01:39:01.860\nThat's a perfect segue.\n\n01:39:01.860 --> 01:39:02.860\nYou know what?\n\n01:39:02.860 --> 01:39:04.860\nThe crowd applauds for moving on.\n\n01:39:04.860 --> 01:39:06.860\nThat means it's...\n\n01:39:06.860 --> 01:39:08.860\nThey're moving on.\n\n01:39:08.860 --> 01:39:11.860\nDoes that mean we can go home soon?\n\n01:39:11.860 --> 01:39:13.860\nI just want to go home now.\n\n01:39:13.860 --> 01:39:15.860\nI do just want to add that I would...\n\n01:39:15.860 --> 01:39:21.860\nSince I don't want to waste a Zipline, my starting point would be wherever atheism was invented,\n\n01:39:21.860 --> 01:39:25.860\nand I would take it to wherever Reddit is headquartered.\n\n01:39:25.860 --> 01:39:31.860\nBut I'm not doing that for, you know, approval.\n\n01:39:31.860 --> 01:39:34.860\nZipline effect.\n\n01:39:34.860 --> 01:39:37.860\nAll right. Next topic, Jews.\n\n01:39:37.860 --> 01:39:38.860\nYes.\n\n01:39:38.860 --> 01:39:41.860\nFinally, the reason I came.\n\n01:39:41.860 --> 01:39:43.860\nDo they exist?\n\n01:39:43.860 --> 01:39:45.860\nYes.\n\n01:39:45.860 --> 01:39:51.860\nHave you seen the Jew footage from Hancock Park?\n\n01:39:51.860 --> 01:39:52.860\nI saw it.\n\n01:39:52.860 --> 01:39:54.860\nIs that a guy in a suit?\n\n01:39:54.860 --> 01:39:56.860\nIt's blurry. We don't know.\n\n01:39:56.860 --> 01:39:58.860\nAlso, I hate when people shoot...\n\n01:39:58.860 --> 01:40:00.860\nVertical.\n\n01:40:00.860 --> 01:40:02.860\nVertical iPhone.\n\n01:40:02.860 --> 01:40:05.860\nBy the way, if you see someone...\n\n01:40:05.860 --> 01:40:07.860\nA policeman shooting a black guy, please shoot him.\n\n01:40:07.860 --> 01:40:09.860\nLandscape it, motherfuckers.\n\n01:40:09.860 --> 01:40:13.860\nHe's not gonna kill another black guy above him.\n\n01:40:13.860 --> 01:40:16.860\nThat's the one place you know you don't...\n\n01:40:16.860 --> 01:40:20.860\nEither way, I have to watch this killing on a fucking H.C.T.V.\n\n01:40:20.860 --> 01:40:22.860\nI'm not a pauper.\n\n01:40:22.860 --> 01:40:25.860\nI Zipline to Best Buy for my

--> 01:40:52.860\nNow, if we were at some other kind of improv theater,\n\n01:40:52.860 --> 01:40:55.860\nI may be frightened, but I've seen UCB blacks.\n\n01:40:55.860 --> 01:40:57.860\nI can take

01:41:06.860\nDid you just challenge all UCB blacks to a fight?\n\n01:41:06.860 --> 01:41:08.860\nHere's the thing, if you put the lights on here,\n\n01:41:08.860 --> 01:41:10.860\nthere's probably two black dudes in this whole fucking theater.\n\n01:41:10.860 --> 01:41:12.860\nAnd you think they're both physically weaker?\n\n01:41:12.860 --> 01:41:14.860\nThat's your problem, not my problem.\n\n01:41:14.860 --> 01:41:17.860\nYou should hang out with more black people, assholes.\n\n01:41:17.860 --> 01:41:19.860\nI have a lot of black friends.\n\n01:41:19.860 --> 01:41:21.860\nYou're just not here because you know it's Sunday.\n\n01:41:21.860 --> 01:41:23.860\nYou keep beating them up.\n\n01:41:23.860 --> 01:41:25.860\nBecause there's Zipline at all sorts of cool places.\n\n01:41:25.860 --> 01:41:27.860\nBecause some friends are the really rich blacks.\n\n01:41:27.860 --> 01:41:29.860\nThey went to Costco, they're going somewhere fun.\n\n01:41:29.860 --> 01:41:31.860\nYes, exactly.\n\n01:41:31.860 --> 01:41:33.860\nThese guys might hang out with all kinds of black people.\n\n01:41:33.860 --> 01:41:35.860\nBy the way, this is the thing that happens.\n\n01:41:35.860 --> 01:41:37.860\nThis is like a lot, the younger crowd's grown a lot.\n\n01:41:37.860 --> 01:41:39.860\nThey get really scared when you talk about shit.\n\n01:41:39.860 --> 01:41:41.860\nThat's like controversial.\n\n01:41:41.860 --> 01:41:43.860\nWell, they get yelled at a lot.\n\n01:41:43.860 --> 01:41:45.860\nThey do get yelled at a lot.\n\n01:41:45.860 --> 01:41:47.860\nThat's not your fault.\n\n01:41:47.860 --> 01:41:49.860\nYou come from a generation of you can't say anything.\n\n01:41:49.860 --> 01:41:51.860\nWhich is great, because I think it's better that we're all exactly the same.\n\n01:41:51.860 --> 01:41:53.860\nThey have to deal with more...\n\n01:41:53.860 --> 01:41:55.860\nI think we should kill culture.\n\n01:41:55.860 --> 01:41:57.860\nThat's what I think.\n\n01:41:57.860 --> 01:41:59.860\nI think that Applebee...\n\n01:41:59.860 --> 01:42:01.860\nI think Olive Garden should be Italian food, that's what I think.\n\n01:42:01.860 --> 01:42:03.860\nSpeaking of culture...\n\n01:42:03.860 --> 01:42:05.860\nWhitewash culture, guys, that's a good call.\n\n01:42:05.860 --> 01:42:07.860\nHow do you

ago.\n\n01:42:25.860 --> 01:42:27.860\nI was just thrilled to have an opportunity.\n\n01:42:27.860 --> 01:42:29.860\nLet's bring up...\n\n01:42:29.860 --> 01:42:31.860\nThis seems like a good
