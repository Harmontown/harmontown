WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
From the East Village, New York City,

00:08.000 --> 00:14.000
UCB Eastside, the cool one.

00:14.000 --> 00:37.000
Harmontown is now in session.

00:37.000 --> 00:48.000
Welcome to the stage, the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.

00:48.000 --> 00:53.000
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
Eastside, Eastside Rap.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
It's the best burrow.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
I think.

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
East, Eastside, Eastside Rap.

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
Give me a second.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
Just give me a second.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
Eastside, Westside, Westside, South.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
Name two burrows.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
Name two burrows.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
You're interrupting my rap.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
All right, starting over, starting over.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
Starting over, here we go.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
Eastside, yeah.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
Eastside, Manhattan is a burrow.

01:22.000 --> 01:25.000
Eastside, the Bronx is a burrow.

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
Eastside, Staten Island is a burrow.

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
Fuck you.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
Bonus burrow.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
Name two more burrows.

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
I know all six of them.

01:39.000 --> 01:44.000
I've memorized them based on the fingers on my hand,

01:44.000 --> 01:51.000
like Papus, or whoever that rapper was.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
Maybe I'm racist.

01:53.000 --> 01:57.000
Yo, yo, yo, racist Eastside Rap.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
My ring finger is Staten Island,

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
because all your mamas are going to Highland.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
That's a street in Staten Island.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
You don't know as much about New York as I do.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
My middle finger is from the Bronx,

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
because I'm like, fuck you.

02:11.000 --> 02:16.000
And I look at King Kong, who's a New York character.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
Famous to me.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
Yo, 9-Eleven happened here.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
Why are we talking about that?

02:22.000 --> 02:26.000
Don't do that in your rap.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
It's a terrible way to start your New York rap,

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
but I don't give a fuck.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
That's New York style.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
I walk with a swagger and I walk for miles,

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
because you can't get a cab if you're truly awesome,

02:37.000 --> 02:42.000
because you're usually black if you are.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
Yo, white guilt, white guilt rap.

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
Eastside racist, white guilt rap.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
I love black people.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
What you think about that?

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
Fuck my dog.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
I always pick up the crap,

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
because I follow municipal orders.

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
I love the government.

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
But only the local one.

03:02.000 --> 03:06.000
The street government.

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
Yo, local government.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
Civic statutes, motherfucker.

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
7125.8.

03:15.000 --> 03:19.000
Park with your wheels turned toward the curb, motherfucker.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
That's more of a guideline that they teach you

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
to avoid your damage to your own car

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
or hurting people,

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
but it's still a civic social contract.

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
Part of the social contract, motherfucker.

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
Take your garbage out, bitch.

03:36.000 --> 03:40.000
But if it's shaped weird, do it on Friday.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
And call them.

03:41.000 --> 03:45.000
Tell them there's a Christmas tree out here, motherfucker.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
Isn't that regular garbage?

03:46.000 --> 03:50.000
That's just, you just put it out there on Wednesday.

03:50.000 --> 03:54.000
Yo, yo, yo.

03:54.000 --> 03:58.000
East side, west side, pants and hats.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
I fucked your mama under the sea dance.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
I'm Marty McFly.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
I got them together.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
I said, I'm gonna fuck her instead.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
Like a feather.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
What?

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
So I fucked her.

04:08.000 --> 04:12.000
That means I fucked her light and gentle.

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
And during the opening of Forrest Gump.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
I fucked her like a feather.

04:19.000 --> 04:23.000
I fucked your mama like a CG feather.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
Yo, yo, yo, yo.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
Yo, yo, yo.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
Let's have a hand for DJ Koi over here.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
It's...

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
DJ Koi.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
All right.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
Yeah.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
Yeah, don't get him confused with DJ Koi.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
He's a...

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
DJ Koi?

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
Yeah.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
Yeah, cause I'm also...

04:58.000 --> 05:03.000
I'm so New York that I love black people and Jews.

05:03.000 --> 05:08.000
I use their words for non-Jews to refer to us.

05:08.000 --> 05:12.000
It's kind of like the N-word for Koi.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
Like, I call you a Koi.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
Cause I'm street.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
What's up, Koi?

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
You've been in New York for a few days.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
You're already that street?

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
Yeah.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
The city invented streets, bitch.

05:26.000 --> 05:30.000
I keep wanting to say the N-word to be authentic.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
Just fucking do it.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
What's the worst thing that could happen?

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
Who could be listening?

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
And who could ever profit from such a thing?

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
Who would ever want to humiliate me

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
or make me seem like a bad person?

05:42.000 --> 05:46.000
There's no way to dip a paddle in that stream.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
I've never... I can't even conceive of it.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
Little old me?

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
You're a Sony anymore, NBC.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
You're a freestyler, man.

05:53.000 --> 05:57.000
Yeah, I'm a free fucking antenna for a horrible clickbait.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
Drop a couple n-bombs, man.

05:59.000 --> 06:03.000
Use this beautiful moment in time to just spread your wings

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
and just be really racist.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
I feel like you'd love it if I did that

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
and I feel like you're a bad person.

06:11.000 --> 06:15.000
But we're Koi, so...

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
What'd you call me?

06:18.000 --> 06:22.000
New York Wacom. That was all the cold open at the time.

06:22.000 --> 06:27.000
We're here at the...

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
We're here on the...

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
We're in the East Village.

06:31.000 --> 06:35.000
Yeah, and the prestigious heroin district.

06:35.000 --> 06:41.000
Yeah, I walk around here and I look at the bricks

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
and I really understand everything about the city.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
Could you live here, Dan?

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
Did you say work took you here and you had to work on a show

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
for two years?

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
Could you enjoy living in the city here?

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
Yeah, I could.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
I don't think I would be functional.

06:57.000 --> 07:01.000
I get lost in LA and I've lived there forever.

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
I got lost in Milwaukee before that and I just...

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
I don't want to give myself excuses,

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
but I believe I don't have a sense of direction.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
You're not supposed to define yourself by your limitations.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
You're not supposed to say, I'm bad at math.

07:13.000 --> 07:19.000
You're supposed to open a textbook and word...

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
It's just another...

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
I feel like I breathe that New York air

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
and I just want to fucking like...

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
I want to put a fucking flourish on this shit.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
It's like...

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
And you know I don't mean a dehumanized black person

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
when I say it.

07:34.000 --> 07:38.000
It's like I mean you and you and the Statue of Liberty

07:38.000 --> 07:42.000
and the pretzel maker.

07:42.000 --> 07:46.000
You're one of your New York salty pretzel makers

07:46.000 --> 07:50.000
and your water that you have flown in from Chicago

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
so your pizza could taste right?

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
I don't know what to do.

07:55.000 --> 07:59.000
Someone said, no.

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
Your bridges and tunnels and the crowds

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
that come through them and across them

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
and how wonderful they all are, what a great city.

08:07.000 --> 08:11.000
You're kind of a little bit xenophobic, rather.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
You're not crazy about the outside world.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
Well, I liked Hercules better.

08:27.000 --> 08:31.000
Comedy show. I got some jokes that I can blow.

08:31.000 --> 08:36.000
If you say Xeno, I think a Xeno.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
That was great.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
That was like we were like Nichols and May

08:39.000 --> 08:43.000
or Pickles and Puberty.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
We were just like Pickles and Puberty.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
They were great.

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
There used to be two center squares in Hollywood Squares

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
and Pickles and Puberty.

08:52.000 --> 08:57.000
But when Pickles died, Syphilis, they changed it.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
There's one square now.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
How can there be two center squares?

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
It was...

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
Geometrically, how does that lay out?

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
It was radio. There was no TV yet.

09:08.000 --> 09:12.000
It was the idea that Hollywood Squares was an idea.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
Was it on radio first?

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
Yeah.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
That seems like a terrible pitch.

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
We have a clip of that right now.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
Do we really?

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
Yeah.

09:20.000 --> 09:27.000
The old original 1927 recording of the Hollywood Squares episode.

09:27.000 --> 09:35.000
Come, come, come there.

09:35.000 --> 09:47.000
The first question is to...

09:47.000 --> 09:51.000
Thomas Edison.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
What...

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
Jack and Joe went up the hill.

09:56.000 --> 10:02.000
But Jack got a blank job from Jill.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
Thomas Edison.

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
Ah, blow, blow job.

10:07.000 --> 10:12.000
Whoa, that's not what we expected.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
Well, I'm Thomas Edison, motherfucker.

10:15.000 --> 10:19.000
My business is things you didn't expect.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
It's called inventions.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
Look it up.

10:22.000 --> 10:26.000
Oh, my God, he said it.

10:26.000 --> 10:30.000
Thomas Edison invented the N-word.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
On the radio version of Hollywood Squares.

10:32.000 --> 10:36.000
But he meant it hatefully.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
He called Tesla.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
Tesla, you fucking...

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
Yeah.

10:43.000 --> 10:47.000
Yeah, he got the World Fair in 1921.

10:47.000 --> 10:51.000
Tesla unveiled alternating current.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
And Edison was like, this should be direct.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
You're a fucking electrical...

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
He called him a...

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
Yeah, he looked at the stuff and he was like,

11:00.000 --> 11:04.000
this is blank rigged, you know?

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
Like, what are you doing?

11:06.000 --> 11:11.000
You can't electrocute an elephant with this.

11:11.000 --> 11:14.000
Thomas Edison loved electrocuting elephants.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
Dan, now that you're quoting historical,

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
you can attribute it to history.

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
You know, Obama said it on Zach Galifianakis' show.

11:22.000 --> 11:26.000
You're allowed to quote Edison calling Tesla.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
He's so racist, he thinks Zach Galifianakis

11:28.000 --> 11:32.000
looks like Marc Maron.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
Oh, Marc Maron, I meant...

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
That is the super racist.

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
You're all the way back to not racist.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
I think all podcasters are Greek.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
Anyways, we're here in the East Village.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
It's famous for its pot pies

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
and its sidewalk pieces.

11:50.000 --> 11:55.000
And it's the fire hydrant

11:55.000 --> 12:00.000
that was used to put out the original New York fire

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
of 1830.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
I'm back there with Wikipedia.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
I know it's...

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
New York had the first fire.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
How did that fire start?

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
There was a monkey...

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
Back then, it was legal to own them as pets.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
And people would bring them,

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
and they would just...

12:20.000 --> 12:24.000
Ellis Island was actually originally called...

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
Monkey Island.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
Because it was overrun.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
They were like cats.

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
You ever go to a restaurant in Miami?

12:32.000 --> 12:36.000
That many cats.

12:36.000 --> 12:41.000
They were the cats of their time.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
That many monkeys?

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
It was a Miami cat level.

12:45.000 --> 12:49.000
People didn't know how to spay or neuter them.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
We didn't know where to start.

12:51.000 --> 12:55.000
Because we would look for their privates,

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
and we would just see monkey things,

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
and we didn't know...

12:59.000 --> 13:02.000
We could find a dog penis and a cat penis,

13:02.000 --> 13:07.000
but when we looked at monkeys, there was a problem.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
Because I don't know why.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
It seems like that would be the opposite.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
You'd think you would go,

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
and I know what I'm looking for.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
I think that's why, because we were looking for something

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
that looked like a human penis, but monkified.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
And instead, we saw...

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
You know what a monkey penis looks like?

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
It's a gnarled little...

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
It looks like a claw.

13:28.000 --> 13:31.000
It looks like a raptor claw.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
So how did the fire start?

13:38.000 --> 13:42.000
Monkey penises are covered with...

13:42.000 --> 13:45.000
I think you pronounce it like a mollusk shell,

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
or a rhino horn.

13:47.000 --> 13:51.000
They're very compacted, and they're hard as glass.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
They have the texture of glass.

13:53.000 --> 14:00.000
They're white, and they curve and taper to a very sharp point.

14:00.000 --> 14:04.000
So we thought that was like a fin or a knife.

14:04.000 --> 14:09.000
So for a long time, you couldn't swing a cat, ironically,

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
in New York...

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
Without hitting a monkey.

14:13.000 --> 14:16.000
And so we was one of them.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
That was the fire.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
Politically, it was blown out of proportion,

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
because there was an anti-monkey sentiment in New York.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
Was this Tammany Hall back in the old days?

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
It was Old Boss Tweed, yeah.

14:27.000 --> 14:30.000
Was mayor of New York, and he...

14:30.000 --> 14:35.000
Yeah, they called him the sugar boys.

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
There's political cartoons where it's Boss Tweed

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
has got a sash that says mayor, but then he's in front of a trough

14:41.000 --> 14:46.000
that says Israel, and...

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
And then there's sugar...

14:48.000 --> 14:52.000
But the bags of sugar, for some reason...

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
He was in late with the monkeys?

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
Boss Tweed was?

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
Yeah, because it was all like...

14:58.000 --> 15:03.000
If monkeys were around, then they shit everywhere,

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
and then it was all the municipal...

15:05.000 --> 15:09.000
Back then, municipal government was just...

15:09.000 --> 15:12.000
It was just your standard monkey grift.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
It was just...

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
Someone's got to clean this up.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
And I was like, oh, I'll do it,

15:18.000 --> 15:21.000
and it's fucking Boss Tweed in a costume.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
I was like, I got it.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
Oh, this is hard. I should have overtime.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
You can have it, because there was no...

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
All of this was happening on the radio,

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
so no one could see that it's the same guy.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
And if you said stuff like,

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
this is literally the same guy that'd go,

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
what are you, an anarchist?

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
Are you like Sacco and Vanzetti?

15:38.000 --> 15:42.000
You could get exterminated for saying that stuff back then.

15:42.000 --> 15:45.000
So how did the fire start?

15:45.000 --> 15:48.000
The legend is...

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
A legend or is it news?

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
That's the thing is that it was all...

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
The truth is...

15:53.000 --> 15:56.000
This was a great New York fire of 1921 or three.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
What was it?

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
18.

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
18.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
The truth is...

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
It's all right.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
The absolute truth is...

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
That was before Miami.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
I looked it up on Snopes.

16:09.000 --> 16:18.000
The actual fact is it was Native Americans started the fire.

16:18.000 --> 16:23.000
That's not a popular thing to say in 18.

16:23.000 --> 16:33.000
There were still Native American cab drivers and...

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
Even back in 1818?

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
Yeah.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
Manhattan is a Native American word.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
That means...

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
City of the Indians.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
It was there...

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
We discovered Manhattan.

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
It's like the emerald city for them was...

16:47.000 --> 16:50.000
Now we fucking killed them and don't care.

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000
I care about them.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
I'm saying I don't care.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
Yo.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
Yo.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
Yo.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
Yo.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
Yo.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
Yo.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
How could we do to them?

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
How could we have been back then?

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
We were the savages.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
We were the monsters.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
Red skin, white skin.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
What's the difference when you put a bullet down?

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
You're gonna get some gibbons.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
They're like monkeys that come from Alaska.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
You put them in a boat.

17:18.000 --> 17:22.000
Don't ask me what to do about that.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
Have you noticed I've got really bad at rap?

17:24.000 --> 17:28.000
In the last five episodes of podcast...

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
New York used to have more cats.

17:30.000 --> 17:33.000
Rap a tap, tap, tap.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
Yo.

17:34.000 --> 17:37.000
Yo.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
Okay, come on.

17:38.000 --> 17:41.000
Let's stop fucking around.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
This whole thing is like...

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
There's people here that haven't seen the show and they're like,

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
this is the show?

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
No, it's not the show.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
What happened to your rap?

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
My show is an examination of the...

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
Dan, Dan.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
I'm sorry to interrupt.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
Why is your rap suffering lately?

17:54.000 --> 17:57.000
You used to be so good at it.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
Don't give me Jack Benny arms.

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
Don't ratchester me.

18:08.000 --> 18:13.000
I will tell you the truth and I can tell you from your sarcasm

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
that you won't agree with this

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
and that you'll probably be amused by it

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
that I'm telling you the honest truth of my theory

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
to answer your honest question.

18:20.000 --> 18:23.000
What is our show if not dealing with the honest truth?

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
My actual honest answer to your question

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
for which I will be punished.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
Not by me.

18:28.000 --> 18:32.000
Well, I don't think so.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
Because you were sarcastic.

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
There's a bubble of insincerity around you.

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
No, stop!

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
There's a bubble of sincerity around me.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
I'm going to tell you the honest answer.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
Why is your rap suffering?

18:44.000 --> 18:47.000
The honest answer is because I feel too confident

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
and comfortable doing it

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
because I've done too many great raps.

18:51.000 --> 18:54.000
See?

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
And there's no...

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
There's nothing...

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
There's no...

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
There's no anxiousness.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
Is there a client here?

19:00.000 --> 19:03.000
It's an art form from the streets.

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
The streets are an anxious, nervous place.

19:06.000 --> 19:11.000
You have to be feral and skittish to rap really well.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
You have to feel like if this rap doesn't work

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
I might not have supper tonight.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
I have to rap for my supper.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
I don't have to rap for my supper.

19:19.000 --> 19:22.000
I can walk in here, lay a shit beat down.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
That beats that shit.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
Whoever made that for free, please don't...

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
That was by Joey Woodward.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
I can drop the opposite of science.

19:30.000 --> 19:33.000
I can drop social studies.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
Are you saying that...

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
I can drop Jim.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
I don't have to drop Mad...

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
I don't have to drop Mad Science anymore.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
I can drop Happy Jim.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
The opposite of Mad Science.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
You're saying you're so comfortable with rap

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
that you're not good anymore at it?

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
You've become too complacent?

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
Yes, yes, yes.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
How do we shake you out of that complacency

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
and get you back into that raw, feral mode?

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
Well, not by telling me I'm bad at it.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
I didn't tell you...

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
You said backstage...

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
You told me backstage...

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
I've lost my mojo with the rapping.

20:08.000 --> 20:11.000
Don't you think we've rapped too much already?

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
Just try as an experiment.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
Just play a really, really, really fast...

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
What's your fastest beat?

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
I just got to be off balance.

20:19.000 --> 20:22.000
I have to stop owning the art of rapping so much.

20:22.000 --> 20:26.000
I have to remember what it's like to be a guest in rap.

20:26.000 --> 20:30.000
Yo, yo, empty, empty, empty head, empty head.

20:30.000 --> 20:33.000
Yo, yo, rapping, rapping.

20:33.000 --> 20:37.000
Yo, yo, yo, my microphone's a weapon.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
I'm a warrior. I fucked your mama so hard.

20:39.000 --> 20:43.000
I felt even sorry for her pussy when I tenderized it

20:43.000 --> 20:46.000
with my pussy is my dick and my dick is my pussy.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
What?

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
Yo, yo, yo, my pussy is my dick

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
and my dick is my pussy.

20:52.000 --> 20:55.000
Yo, yo, I said my penis is a dick

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
and my dick is a penis.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
I fucked your mom like my name was Ennis

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
from Duke's of Hazard.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
He spun off...

21:03.000 --> 21:06.000
You're 25.

21:06.000 --> 21:09.000
I feel it.

21:09.000 --> 21:12.000
Yo, Houston Avenue. Houston?

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
Houston.

21:17.000 --> 21:20.000
Yo, yo, Houston Avenue.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
East and West.

21:21.000 --> 21:24.000
I fucked your mama so hard that she exploded her chest.

21:24.000 --> 21:28.000
My penis was deep and it came out of her nipple

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
and it was a...

21:30.000 --> 21:34.000
Yeah, I agree, I agree.

21:34.000 --> 21:39.000
So you saying ew doesn't make me feel nervous.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
That was my point.

21:40.000 --> 21:43.000
You might as well be saying ew while you're watching

21:43.000 --> 21:47.000
like a bomb go off in Hurtlocker.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
Do you think the director would be like,

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
oh no, I made Hurtlocker wrong?

21:51.000 --> 21:56.000
No, that's her point.

21:56.000 --> 21:59.000
Your generation is...

21:59.000 --> 22:05.000
You don't get it.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
Trust me, trust me.

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
And you need to accept it.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
You always want that explained to you

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
when an old person says it.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
You guys are always walking on Houston Avenue.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
Yeah.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
You're like, oh, am I in Texas?

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
No, it's a fucking different word.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
You pronounce it differently.

22:19.000 --> 22:22.000
You fucking holograms.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
You fucking Pokemons.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
You fucking like hoverboards.

22:25.000 --> 22:31.000
You fucking... You fucking Jumanji's.

22:31.000 --> 22:37.000
You Jumanji-eating Vitamix-using fucking Macha-drinking

22:37.000 --> 22:41.000
fucking supplement-taking...

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
Say it, say it.

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
Say it.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
Fucking say it.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
Say it.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
No.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
No.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
The heart wants what it wants, Dan.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
The heart wants what it wants.

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
Why don't you guys make your stamps more expensive?

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
What the fuck are you doing?

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
Pick a price.

22:58.000 --> 23:01.000
Fucking youngsters.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
When I was a kid,

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
stamps were cheaper.

23:04.000 --> 23:07.000
You guys are crazy.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
What do you think you're going to find a stamp price

23:09.000 --> 23:13.000
that's going to make you a good people?

23:13.000 --> 23:16.000
It's a sticker on an envelope.

23:16.000 --> 23:21.000
Wake up.

23:21.000 --> 23:29.000
The laziest George Carlin.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
That's funny, the idea of like a curmudgeon

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
who's crediting like...

23:33.000 --> 23:34.000
Stamps.

23:34.000 --> 23:35.000
We don't...

23:35.000 --> 23:38.000
I don't have to explain what I was going for.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
But I'm telling you, I thought it was funny

23:40.000 --> 23:43.000
because you didn't and I want you to know I don't care.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
I have something called agency.

23:45.000 --> 23:50.000
Ever heard of it?

23:50.000 --> 23:54.000
Why are you attacking the crowds so much right now?

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
You're coming at them.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
They're from New York.

23:56.000 --> 24:00.000
They respect you if you're like...

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
This isn't fucking la-la land

24:02.000 --> 24:05.000
where we can make them applaud by coating ourselves

24:05.000 --> 24:08.000
in marshmallows.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
I'm sure you would kind of be into that,

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
but you know, they want...

24:12.000 --> 24:15.000
You need to be salty in New York.

24:15.000 --> 24:18.000
They put it on the streets here when it snows.

24:18.000 --> 24:21.000
It's a salty city.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
You know what Manhattan means in Native American?

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
It means the city of...

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
It's a salty city.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
It's just crazy.

24:28.000 --> 24:32.000
Jack Gleason was born here.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
Jack Gleason.

24:34.000 --> 24:38.000
And he died on...

24:38.000 --> 24:42.000
on vacation.

24:42.000 --> 24:45.000
And up here outside of Staten Island

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
where the ferry is.

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
And we're going to talk about that later

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
and a bunch of other stuff.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
But first, let's...

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
We forgot to bring up Spencer.

24:55.000 --> 24:59.000
Spencer!

24:59.000 --> 25:04.000
Yo, yo, yo.

25:04.000 --> 25:08.000
Yo, yo, yo.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
Hey, guys.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.000
That was my bad.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
You got to bring this guy up, man.

25:13.000 --> 25:16.000
These guys just got cheated out of all...

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
Spencer could have been up here the whole time, but just...

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
But they don't know.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
Spencer is now, like, loaded.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
It's lock, stock, and barrel.

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
All right, let me have it.

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
Barrel?

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
Spencer laid on his New York.

25:26.000 --> 25:27.000
What do you think?

25:27.000 --> 25:33.000
I think the buildings, they're going to fall apart.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
In California, there's earthquakes.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
The building codes are really higher,

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
and it makes me really nervous

25:38.000 --> 25:42.000
when I'm not around those California-secured buildings.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
No offense.

25:43.000 --> 25:47.000
Not any of your faults, probably.

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
So when you walk around these buildings

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
that have been here for a long, long time,

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
you feel like they might crumble at any moment?

25:53.000 --> 25:56.000
Yeah, I mean, you know how many, like, cars

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
or, like, trucks or, like, Kool-Aid Man

25:58.000 --> 26:01.000
can, like, burst through a brick wall?

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
Just take out a city block.

26:03.000 --> 26:07.000
Do you feel that L.A. is more Kool-Aid Man secure?

26:07.000 --> 26:11.000
You know how you never see Kool-Aid Man in L.A.?

26:11.000 --> 26:15.000
They don't set out to prevent Kool-Aid Man-ery,

26:15.000 --> 26:18.000
but by making a building earthquake-proof,

26:18.000 --> 26:21.000
like, Kool-Aid Man bounces off of those things.

26:21.000 --> 26:22.000
He walks into the front door.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
You know what his catchphrase is in L.A.?

26:24.000 --> 26:25.000
What?

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
Oh, no.

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
Is that right?

26:28.000 --> 26:29.000
Yeah.

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
The Kool-Aid Man has to change his catchphrase

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
when he's in L.A.

26:33.000 --> 26:36.000
There are no Kool-Aid commercials anymore.

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
They're just, like, they're being so nice.

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
They're like, I'm sure I'll look it up later,

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
I'm sure there's such a thing as a Kool-Aid Man,

26:42.000 --> 26:45.000
and I'm sure he, I'm sure, like,

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
maybe his catchphrase was, oh, yes.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
Go on YouTube and look up what we're talking about.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
Kool-Aid Man used to, he was kind of a terrorist.

26:50.000 --> 26:54.000
He would, there would be thirsty children at a party,

26:54.000 --> 26:57.000
and they'd go, I'm thirsty, and a giant terrorist

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
would burst through the wall.

26:59.000 --> 27:02.000
It was a man, it wasn't a man, it was a monster.

27:02.000 --> 27:06.000
It was an anthropomorphic jug, a jar of, a jug,

27:06.000 --> 27:09.000
a pitcher, an anthropomorphic pitcher of Kool-Aid

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
with a face on it.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
I think the kids know.

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
There's been Family Guy episodes about this.

27:15.000 --> 27:16.000
Oh, okay, Family Guy.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
All right, go watch Family Guy

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
so you can understand my comedy.

27:20.000 --> 27:24.000
I wanted to throw the drink down,

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
but then I was like, I'd be, I'd just say it.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
Say the word, Dan.

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
Say the word.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
I'm not gonna say your hate-filled word.

27:32.000 --> 27:35.000
I'm on, I'm on that absinthe right now.

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
Oh, you drank, did you drink some of,

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
some of Jane's absinthe?

27:39.000 --> 27:43.000
I might have drank more than other people who drank it.

27:43.000 --> 27:44.000
Yeah.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
Our friend, is it cooked, Jane Cook?

27:46.000 --> 27:47.000
Yeah.

27:47.000 --> 27:50.000
It makes, it's so close to Dane Cook that she...

27:50.000 --> 27:53.000
And Dane Cook did a bit about the Kool-Aid man.

27:53.000 --> 27:56.000
He doesn't like it when juice wears tights.

27:56.000 --> 28:01.000
Yeah, from that album in like 19, I don't know.

28:01.000 --> 28:04.000
So I'm treading in safe water, that's what we're saying.

28:04.000 --> 28:08.000
You took it in a whole new left field direction.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
His catchphrase is, oh no, in LA.

28:10.000 --> 28:13.000
When you're at a party as a kid in LA and you go,

28:13.000 --> 28:17.000
I'm thirsty, sometimes you'll hear a thud.

28:17.000 --> 28:22.000
And then like a crack of glass, the shattering of glass.

28:22.000 --> 28:26.000
And someone saying, oh no.

28:26.000 --> 28:30.000
And that's how you know that you should buy Kool-Aid.

28:30.000 --> 28:35.000
Because remember, the commercials aren't for architecture.

28:35.000 --> 28:36.000
No.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
If they were, the Kool-Aid corporation would be like,

28:38.000 --> 28:41.000
let's not air this, but there are LA commercials

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
where you hear the thud and you hear, oh no.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
And they say, look, it's still fucking delicious.

28:45.000 --> 28:50.000
You just can't get into your house unless you invite him in.

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
He's like a vampire.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
Yeah, let the right Kool-Aid jug in.

28:54.000 --> 28:57.000
Except unlike a vampire, when you do invite him in,

28:57.000 --> 29:00.000
then he goes, I'm trying, I can't fit.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
Why do you think I come through the wall?

29:02.000 --> 29:03.000
Cover on the back.

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
We have a backyard.

29:05.000 --> 29:10.000
We have a, like, we have to have my birthday party

29:10.000 --> 29:14.000
at a stadium with a dome so that you can hear, oh yeah,

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
and he's dropped it.

29:16.000 --> 29:17.000
Dumb.

29:17.000 --> 29:18.000
I got excited.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.000
I got stuttered.

29:19.000 --> 29:20.000
And I was like, why did he stutter for that?

29:20.000 --> 29:21.000
Why did that make him excited?

29:21.000 --> 29:25.000
Did he think it was going to be neat to what he said?

29:25.000 --> 29:28.000
Honey, what do you think causes Dan stutter?

29:28.000 --> 29:32.000
I think it seems like when he gets really excited about what

29:32.000 --> 29:35.000
he's going to say next, why would he be excited about that

29:35.000 --> 29:38.000
stadium thing?

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
Well, he doesn't always know, sweetie.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
It's not a written show.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
He's not a proud person.

29:44.000 --> 29:48.000
The show's not called Dan Harmon's Proud of Himself.

29:48.000 --> 29:51.000
And even if it was, the content of the show doesn't need

29:51.000 --> 29:54.000
to prove the title right.

29:54.000 --> 30:02.000
There's no bondage in family ties.

30:02.000 --> 30:06.000
Knight Rider doesn't wear armor and they doesn't exist.

30:06.000 --> 30:12.000
There's nobody named Knight Rider in that show.

30:12.000 --> 30:13.000
There's a guy named Knight.

30:13.000 --> 30:14.000
The car's name is Kit.

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
Look it up.

30:16.000 --> 30:17.000
This is all New York shit.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
You should be into this.

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
It should be called Kit Rider.

30:21.000 --> 30:27.000
Thank you.

30:27.000 --> 30:30.000
I'll be here till Thursday.

30:30.000 --> 30:31.000
Why?

30:31.000 --> 30:34.000
I think that's when I go home.

30:34.000 --> 30:35.000
You hear till Thursday?

30:35.000 --> 30:36.000
I think.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.000
I don't know.

30:37.000 --> 30:38.000
All right.

30:38.000 --> 30:39.000
Well, we're being rude to our guest.

30:39.000 --> 30:40.000
So here's the thing.

30:40.000 --> 30:44.000
In introducing this, our friend, I want to explain to you why

30:44.000 --> 30:45.000
I'm here.

30:45.000 --> 30:46.000
It's for UNICEF.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
There's a basket being passed.

30:48.000 --> 30:54.000
Real funny, they're crippled.

30:54.000 --> 30:59.000
Great.

30:59.000 --> 31:03.000
Yo, yo, yo, yo.

31:03.000 --> 31:08.000
UNICEF.

31:08.000 --> 31:11.000
They need your money real bad because some people are born

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
with the chances you didn't have.

31:13.000 --> 31:16.000
You were born with two arms.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.000
Some people weren't.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
Give them money.

31:19.000 --> 31:24.000
Is that what UNICEF is?

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
UNICEF needs better PR.

31:26.000 --> 31:32.000
So give them money and you can know who they are.

31:32.000 --> 31:36.000
Yeah, yeah.

31:36.000 --> 31:37.000
Yeah.

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
Please help UNICEF tonight.

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
We've forgotten what they are.

31:41.000 --> 31:45.000
And that is a terrible life for a charity.

31:45.000 --> 31:49.000
UNICEF needs your help before it can go back to helping people.

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
Help them brand themselves.

31:51.000 --> 31:52.000
Yeah.

31:52.000 --> 31:53.000
Yeah.

31:53.000 --> 31:54.000
I mean, March of Dimes, who could forget them?

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
I mean, it's like, wow.

31:56.000 --> 31:57.000
Dimes.

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
Those are obviously the people that...

31:59.000 --> 32:00.000
What does March of Dimes do?

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
What does March of Dimes do?

32:02.000 --> 32:05.000
Well, I mean, doesn't that sound like a fucking horrible

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
horror premise, the March of Dimes?

32:07.000 --> 32:10.000
I always, it always scared me when I would hear that.

32:10.000 --> 32:11.000
Like, I'm sorry.

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
Don't forget March of Dimes is coming.

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
Why is that... Why is it scary?

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
The March of Anything is scary.

32:17.000 --> 32:18.000
Okay.

32:18.000 --> 32:22.000
But Dimes are so small.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
Yeah, but it's like, it's not like...

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
It's like the March of Souls.

32:26.000 --> 32:27.000
Like, it's not... The things aren't March of...

32:27.000 --> 32:28.000
The Souls are terrifying.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
It's the March...

32:30.000 --> 32:31.000
But the thing that's...

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
The March of is not the thing that's marching.

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
Right, right, okay.

32:35.000 --> 32:42.000
The March of Genocide is Nazis.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
The March of Dimes is like...

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
I don't know what's coming, but it wants your dimes.

32:46.000 --> 32:49.000
And I haven't had any since 1968.

32:49.000 --> 32:52.000
It's worse than a penny because it's smaller.

32:52.000 --> 32:56.000
And there's a guy on it that looks like...

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
Who's on the dime, Dan?

32:58.000 --> 32:59.000
The dime...

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
It's Michael Chiklis is on the dime.

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
If you really look at it...

33:03.000 --> 33:07.000
From my memory, I haven't looked at a dime since

33:07.000 --> 33:10.000
before I heard of Michael Chiklis, but based on...

33:10.000 --> 33:13.000
I'm remembering Michael Chiklis on the dime.

33:13.000 --> 33:16.000
Our next guest played the thing in the first

33:16.000 --> 33:21.000
Fantastic Four movie, Michael Chiklis.

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
If Michael Chiklis came out right now,

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
that would be the best segue of all time.

33:25.000 --> 33:29.000
See if you can find Roger Corman's horrible shitty...

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
I have to hurry up and finish making this movie

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
or I'll lose the rights to make it.

33:33.000 --> 33:36.000
Fantastic Four movie, which Michael Chiklis plays the thing.

33:36.000 --> 33:40.000
And because he already says it's clobbering time

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
in the first half of the movie,

33:42.000 --> 33:45.000
he's left with nothing else to say at the end of the movie.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
When he comes into the third act, he goes,

33:47.000 --> 33:51.000
it's clobbering time for real.

33:51.000 --> 33:52.000
It's so sad.

33:52.000 --> 33:56.000
It's like an alcoholic dad.

33:56.000 --> 33:59.000
We're going to the zoo and I mean it.

33:59.000 --> 34:04.000
Sorry about the last clobbering time.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
It kind of got interrupted.

34:06.000 --> 34:09.000
I fell asleep.

34:09.000 --> 34:14.000
It's the clobbering thought that counts.

34:14.000 --> 34:19.000
My dad hit me ten times more than yours hits you.

34:19.000 --> 34:23.000
And that's the progress.

34:23.000 --> 34:27.000
I consider myself a pacifist compared to him.

34:27.000 --> 34:28.000
You're welcome.

34:28.000 --> 34:31.000
So clobbering time is terrifying for the kids.

34:31.000 --> 34:36.000
March of dimes.

34:36.000 --> 34:37.000
It follows.

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
That's an innocuous but terrifying.

34:39.000 --> 34:40.000
It follows.

34:40.000 --> 34:41.000
What follows?

34:41.000 --> 34:42.000
March of dimes.

34:42.000 --> 34:43.000
What do they want?

34:43.000 --> 34:44.000
They want dimes.

34:44.000 --> 34:47.000
Well, but why?

34:47.000 --> 34:48.000
Like pumpkin head.

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
That's scary because it sounds like dumb.

34:50.000 --> 34:51.000
Like pumpkin head.

34:51.000 --> 34:52.000
Oh, fuck.

34:52.000 --> 34:53.000
All right.

34:53.000 --> 34:54.000
Come on.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
We have a guest tonight.

34:56.000 --> 34:59.000
So the reason I'm in New York is not for UNICEF.

34:59.000 --> 35:04.000
That was all a joke.

35:04.000 --> 35:09.000
And a scene.

35:09.000 --> 35:18.000
All right.

35:18.000 --> 35:19.000
Yeah.

35:19.000 --> 35:24.000
Touch my hair and then say gross.

35:24.000 --> 35:28.000
So now I'm 11 again.

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
I just fucked you in the butt.

35:30.000 --> 35:34.000
And then that wasn't enough for you.

35:34.000 --> 35:38.000
That's the greatest compliment a person can give another person is to fuck him right in

35:38.000 --> 35:39.000
the butt.

35:39.000 --> 35:40.000
Right?

35:40.000 --> 35:41.000
Yeah.

35:41.000 --> 35:46.000
Right in New York.

35:46.000 --> 35:52.000
New York is a butt fucking town.

35:52.000 --> 35:53.000
Well, they call it.

35:53.000 --> 35:57.000
Sadami is called a New York salute.

35:57.000 --> 36:00.000
I couldn't think of anything better.

36:00.000 --> 36:05.000
The next guy could come up with something better because he's our guest and he's a professional

36:05.000 --> 36:06.000
comedy writer.

36:06.000 --> 36:07.000
Checklist.

36:07.000 --> 36:08.000
Checklist.

36:08.000 --> 36:14.000
So the reason I'm here in New York is because I'm shooting this thing for IFC.

36:14.000 --> 36:18.000
Ever heard of it?

36:18.000 --> 36:22.000
Unlike these other basic cable networks, their name still means something.

36:22.000 --> 36:27.000
It's a raw bone documentary about monkeys starting the fire of 1921.

36:27.000 --> 36:31.000
I mean, because when you hear the description of the pilot, you'll go, what does that have

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
to do with independence or film?

36:33.000 --> 36:38.000
But if you really think about it, you'll go, oh, okay.

36:38.000 --> 36:42.000
Because the network is going to, you're going to have a new slogan, like TLC.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
It's like, because they show the things.

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
It's like, duck, duck town.

36:46.000 --> 36:47.000
What is this?

36:47.000 --> 36:54.000
But as if an apology, they go like, TLC, because you could learn about anything.

36:54.000 --> 36:57.000
It's all animal planet.

36:57.000 --> 36:58.000
It's very human.

36:58.000 --> 37:01.000
Meaning there's no fucking animals in that goddamn fucking channel.

37:01.000 --> 37:02.000
Humans are animals too.

37:02.000 --> 37:03.000
Why do you apologize?

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
Make different programming then.

37:05.000 --> 37:08.000
There has been no arts or entertainment on A&E.

37:08.000 --> 37:16.000
Change your name to television station number nine.

37:16.000 --> 37:21.000
Up next, Breaking Bad here on AMC.

37:21.000 --> 37:27.000
Where you're watching new classics, where's they happen?

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
Toothpaste Wars on the History Channel.

37:29.000 --> 37:37.000
Because, hey, people might hear about this one day if you watch.

37:37.000 --> 37:40.000
Slut Night on Discovery Channel.

37:40.000 --> 37:43.000
No disclaimer necessary.

37:43.000 --> 37:46.000
Discovery, everything's a discovery.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
Slut Night.

37:48.000 --> 37:53.000
What happens, what do you think is going to happen on season three of Slut Night?

37:53.000 --> 37:58.000
Well, they're kicking Maggie off.

37:58.000 --> 37:59.000
No!

37:59.000 --> 38:00.000
We love Maggie.

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
She's the sluttiest one.

38:02.000 --> 38:05.000
Oh yeah, you guys, New York hates Maggie, of course.

38:05.000 --> 38:06.000
Well, yeah.

38:06.000 --> 38:09.000
But by the way, she's from Long Island.

38:09.000 --> 38:14.000
But she says New York.

38:14.000 --> 38:18.000
And I'm sorry, I'm not going to win any popularity contests for saying this.

38:18.000 --> 38:22.000
But she's no slut.

38:22.000 --> 38:23.000
There, I said it.

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
She's not a slut.

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
We've divided the crowd on that one.

38:27.000 --> 38:30.000
She has agency.

38:30.000 --> 38:36.000
They edit it out.

38:36.000 --> 38:39.000
More sluts, Discovery Channel.

38:39.000 --> 38:45.000
Less fake sluts.

38:45.000 --> 38:54.000
She's an autonomous person with status.

38:54.000 --> 38:58.000
So the reason I'm here is we're shooting a pilot.

38:58.000 --> 39:03.000
They've cast me as a host and I don't think you have to ask why.

39:03.000 --> 39:09.000
Because just look at what you've seen tonight.

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
Is it a show about Asperger's, Dan?

39:11.000 --> 39:15.000
Why are you...

39:15.000 --> 39:18.000
Is it a show for the blind?

39:18.000 --> 39:24.000
Is it a show in which there's names of people's...

39:24.000 --> 39:29.000
pictures of people's faces on the floor so that what normally looks like someone staring

39:29.000 --> 39:32.000
at the floor while they talk?

39:32.000 --> 39:37.000
Is the new definition of a professional host?

39:37.000 --> 39:43.000
Is the show called This Week's Current Events as Flortile?

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
How did you get this job?

39:45.000 --> 39:46.000
I don't know.

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
It's a bad economy.

39:48.000 --> 39:52.000
Times are tough and no one's watching TV anymore.

39:52.000 --> 39:58.000
Is there so much cachet in the Dan Harmon brand right now that we want you to host our show?

39:58.000 --> 40:06.000
We're meeting in the middle, like my podcast is ganging a few listeners, TV's losing a few viewers.

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
So we meet in a nice happy middle.

40:08.000 --> 40:09.000
They're like, how about you?

40:09.000 --> 40:10.000
I don't know.

40:10.000 --> 40:11.000
We ran out of people.

40:11.000 --> 40:14.000
Who do you think they passed on right before it came to you?

40:14.000 --> 40:19.000
One of them is our next guest, actually.

40:19.000 --> 40:20.000
For real?

40:20.000 --> 40:21.000
Yeah, I know.

40:21.000 --> 40:24.000
You'd think we wouldn't get along, but I really like this guy.

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
I've just been chatting with him for five minutes backstage.

40:26.000 --> 40:27.000
He's not bitter?

40:27.000 --> 40:28.000
No, he's not.

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
Well, you'll find out.

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
He's a wonderful personality.

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
He's from Long Island.

40:34.000 --> 40:37.000
Are you from Long Island?

40:37.000 --> 40:44.000
Which I kind of shit on just a second ago, but I don't know anything about it, so it doesn't matter.

40:44.000 --> 40:48.000
So the thing that we're doing is this...

40:48.000 --> 40:51.000
We'll talk about it with him as a way of explaining it.

40:51.000 --> 40:57.000
Because otherwise, then I'll be like 12, and I won't have...

40:57.000 --> 41:04.000
The title of this episode, it will be Dan introduces...

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
And we never meet...

41:06.000 --> 41:07.000
Such a good episode.

41:07.000 --> 41:11.000
He talked about slavery.

41:11.000 --> 41:14.000
Is the IFC show going to be this riveting?

41:14.000 --> 41:17.000
Is it going to be like this kind of trenchant interviews?

41:17.000 --> 41:20.000
Nope.

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
Let's bring him out.

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
No, stop it.

41:24.000 --> 41:27.000
Well, if I didn't have to do a good introduction, like a good host test.

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
Okay, let's take it from the top.

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
Do you want music for this?

41:31.000 --> 41:32.000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
Yeah, beat Dick Cavett, pretend you're sitting on the couch,

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
and it's like, you know, it's groovy.

41:36.000 --> 41:37.000
It's the 70s.

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
You're going to bring somebody out.

41:39.000 --> 41:49.000
Few television shows in recent memory have had as much impact on the entertainosphere.

41:49.000 --> 41:53.000
As the deceptively named daily show.

41:53.000 --> 42:01.000
For truly, it is a show for the century.

42:01.000 --> 42:05.000
And although it airs daily, there's nothing daily about it.

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
There's a lot of daily stuff about it.

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
Anyways, we all love the daily show.

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
This guy was...

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
Let's take it from the top, Dan.

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
Let's take it from the top.

42:15.000 --> 42:18.000
Guest intro, take two.

42:18.000 --> 42:26.000
Long Island born stand-up comic and comedy writer and television producer.

42:26.000 --> 42:29.000
But you can't say his name in the middle of the introduction.

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
So-and-so is...

42:31.000 --> 42:32.000
They can't say that.

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
That makes it sound like...

42:34.000 --> 42:35.000
Take three, take three.

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
Guest intro, take three.

42:37.000 --> 42:38.000
Take three.

42:38.000 --> 42:43.000
This next Long Island born stand-up comic and television producer.

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
That sounds like we have a lot of them.

42:45.000 --> 42:46.000
No, that's great.

42:46.000 --> 42:47.000
That's so good.

42:47.000 --> 42:48.000
Dan, so good.

42:48.000 --> 42:51.000
We go live in 15 seconds.

42:51.000 --> 42:59.000
Our next guest's Long Island birth and stand-up comedy has been the talk of town in Staten Island.

42:59.000 --> 43:00.000
We're live in five seconds.

43:00.000 --> 43:01.000
And at the daily show.

43:01.000 --> 43:02.000
We're live.

43:02.000 --> 43:03.000
We're live.

43:03.000 --> 43:04.000
We're live.

43:04.000 --> 43:05.000
We're over 13 years.

43:05.000 --> 43:06.000
Two.

43:06.000 --> 43:07.000
One.

43:07.000 --> 43:08.000
We're live.

43:08.000 --> 43:09.000
Go.

43:09.000 --> 43:15.000
Ladies and gentlemen, my new friend and a guy who's going to be performing in the pilot that we're going to be telling you a little bit about.

43:15.000 --> 43:24.000
UNICEF founder.

43:24.000 --> 43:35.000
Inventor of the Bechdel test, which was then given credit, was given to some woman.

43:35.000 --> 43:44.000
You're welcome, Jenny Bechdel.

43:44.000 --> 43:49.000
You know that, you know, she came up with that test in the midst of a terrible breakup.

43:49.000 --> 43:50.000
We're live.

43:50.000 --> 43:51.000
We're live.

43:51.000 --> 43:52.000
With a man that defined her life.

43:52.000 --> 43:53.000
We're live.

43:53.000 --> 43:54.000
Our new friend.

43:54.000 --> 43:55.000
We'll be right back.

43:55.000 --> 43:56.000
We're going to go commercial.

43:56.000 --> 43:57.000
Goldbond powder.

43:57.000 --> 43:58.000
UNICEF.

43:58.000 --> 43:59.000
We're getting better every day.

43:59.000 --> 44:00.000
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Rory Albanese.

44:00.000 --> 44:01.000
We're live.

44:01.000 --> 44:02.000
We're live.

44:02.000 --> 44:03.000
We're live.

44:03.000 --> 44:04.000
We're live.

44:04.000 --> 44:05.000
We're live.

44:05.000 --> 44:06.000
We're live.

44:06.000 --> 44:07.000
We're live.

44:07.000 --> 44:08.000
We're live.

44:08.000 --> 44:09.000
We're live.

44:09.000 --> 44:10.000
We're live.

44:10.000 --> 44:11.000
We're live.

44:11.000 --> 44:12.000
We're live.

44:12.000 --> 44:13.000
We're live.

44:13.000 --> 44:14.000
We're live.

44:14.000 --> 44:20.000
I think, okay, I'll sit here.

44:20.000 --> 44:21.000
Hello.

44:21.000 --> 44:22.000
I'm very sorry.

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
I'm sorry.

44:24.000 --> 44:25.000
We're live.

44:25.000 --> 44:26.000
What an intro.

44:26.000 --> 44:29.000
I want to watch that show.

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
Just you between me.

44:31.000 --> 44:32.000
Hello, everybody.

44:32.000 --> 44:35.000
So, Dan beat you out of a job to host the show.

44:35.000 --> 44:36.000
I did.

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
I didn't even think of it that way because I would not have said yes this should.

44:38.000 --> 44:40.600
Figured out your art's name is Cy.

44:40.600 --> 44:41.760
Is that the right one?

44:41.760 --> 44:45.680
All I heard was, well, while they were singing your praises,

44:45.680 --> 44:48.400
like there was that much of a clause in it that was like,

44:48.400 --> 44:50.440
he actually was going to host, or I wanted to host.

44:50.440 --> 44:52.200
And I was like, oh, that sounds like,

44:52.200 --> 44:56.720
that sounds like he'll be a real Robin to my Batman.

44:56.720 --> 44:57.920
Wait a minute.

44:57.920 --> 44:58.880
That's a good thing, right?

44:58.880 --> 44:59.960
Robin, you're Batman.

44:59.960 --> 45:01.880
Well, that's the sarcasm, is that it?

45:01.880 --> 45:02.880
Oh, I see the sarcasm is that word.

45:02.880 --> 45:04.080
It's like he's going to want to murder me.

45:04.080 --> 45:06.520
The sarcasm might be more like the Scarecrow.

45:06.520 --> 45:07.000
Yeah.

45:07.000 --> 45:07.800
I got you.

45:07.800 --> 45:08.200
I'm sorry.

45:08.200 --> 45:08.920
No, not at all.

45:08.920 --> 45:10.200
I think it's great that you're hosting.

45:10.200 --> 45:11.520
Yeah, because we like each other.

45:11.520 --> 45:14.320
Because we immediately started talking about Witcher 3

45:14.320 --> 45:16.480
and video games and role-playing.

45:16.480 --> 45:17.960
We did, Witcher 3.

45:17.960 --> 45:21.160
What's up, ladies?

45:21.160 --> 45:24.760
When I was talking about Witcher 2, like a bunch of losers.

45:24.760 --> 45:25.960
Got the third one.

45:25.960 --> 45:26.920
Yeah.

45:26.920 --> 45:29.320
It's because we got enough money for a PS4.

45:29.320 --> 45:32.320
Yeah.

45:32.320 --> 45:34.880
Wait, did my mic go off, or am I just less effective?

45:34.880 --> 45:35.760
I don't hear you.

45:35.760 --> 45:38.520
I think it went off.

45:38.520 --> 45:39.080
Yeah.

45:39.080 --> 45:46.720
OK, so you come from the whiplash, breakneck,

45:46.720 --> 45:49.640
thrill-a-minute world of daily.

45:49.640 --> 45:50.880
There's a fucking intro.

45:50.880 --> 45:52.600
Yeah.

45:52.600 --> 45:53.160
Yeah, man.

45:53.160 --> 45:53.880
Now you're doing it.

45:53.880 --> 45:59.000
In the outback of Pickle Dick, Boomerang, Zoom Zoomery,

45:59.000 --> 46:00.040
that is the daily show.

46:00.040 --> 46:03.120
Yes, Pickle Dickery is our fucking motto, man.

46:03.120 --> 46:05.240
You don't have a Pickle Dick, get off the fucking can.

46:05.240 --> 46:07.240
That's what we say.

46:07.240 --> 46:08.920
It's on the bumper sticker, guys.

46:08.920 --> 46:10.720
Daily show left no dick on Pickles.

46:10.720 --> 46:12.440
On Pickles, yeah.

46:12.440 --> 46:14.120
Every now and then, a fucking Republican

46:14.120 --> 46:16.880
would come through and be like, Pickle that dick, you know?

46:16.880 --> 46:20.240
People would be like, these guys are on the fucking pulse.

46:20.240 --> 46:22.920
These guys are on the, they got their fucking beat

46:22.920 --> 46:26.360
on the dick on the pulse, you know what I mean?

46:26.360 --> 46:30.600
Did you start doing stand-up, I assume,

46:30.600 --> 46:32.440
and then like kind of branched into writing,

46:32.440 --> 46:33.000
or were you always?

46:33.000 --> 46:35.040
I started doing stand-up right when I started.

46:35.040 --> 46:37.000
This is not going to be that exciting.

46:37.000 --> 46:40.600
I was a lot, there was like, man. Hey, that's my job,

46:40.600 --> 46:41.280
saying that.

46:41.280 --> 46:44.280
It was, we were rapping before.

46:44.280 --> 46:46.760
Let me just say something very quickly about Long Island

46:46.760 --> 46:48.680
in its defense, all right?

46:48.680 --> 46:50.000
Surprisingly short.

46:50.000 --> 46:51.120
Yes, surprisingly short.

46:51.120 --> 46:54.600
Also, Brooklyn and Queens are on Long Island, all right?

46:54.600 --> 46:56.840
So just for the record, when some fucking ding-dong

46:56.840 --> 46:58.600
from Brooklyn is like, you're going to Long Island,

46:58.600 --> 47:01.320
be like, that's where you live, all right?

47:01.320 --> 47:02.720
That's where you fucking live.

47:02.720 --> 47:04.560
When I was a kid, that's where you fucking live.

47:04.560 --> 47:06.240
It's on the island, Brooklyn, Queens.

47:06.240 --> 47:11.720
When I was 10, me and my friend lit a telephone pole on fire.

47:11.720 --> 47:12.720
It's the opposite of talking.

47:12.720 --> 47:13.880
This can't be true.

47:13.880 --> 47:14.800
For real.

47:14.800 --> 47:18.360
It was the 4th of July, and we put a bunch of firecrackers

47:18.360 --> 47:21.280
inside a telephone pole because there was bugs in it.

47:21.280 --> 47:23.240
Do you know what telephone poles are?

47:23.240 --> 47:26.800
I feel like we're going to find out that it's like a coin

47:26.800 --> 47:27.440
purse or something.

47:27.440 --> 47:28.960
It's like, no, there's a telephone pole.

47:28.960 --> 47:31.360
There's those things with the leaves and apples.

47:31.360 --> 47:32.560
And they're very flammable.

47:32.560 --> 47:33.440
I also love that.

47:33.440 --> 47:34.320
It was a big thing.

47:34.320 --> 47:35.720
You're like, because there were bugs in it,

47:35.720 --> 47:37.240
you did the right thing.

47:37.240 --> 47:39.120
I mean, you can't have bugs in a telephone pole.

47:39.120 --> 47:41.720
We were 11 or 10 years old, and we were being assholes.

47:41.720 --> 47:44.120
And there was termites inside this telephone pole

47:44.120 --> 47:45.000
because of the thing.

47:45.000 --> 47:47.920
So we put a bunch of firecrackers in it and fireworks.

47:47.920 --> 47:49.240
And then it lit on fire.

47:49.240 --> 47:52.520
And the fire department was sure to have that.

47:52.520 --> 47:55.160
The guys who saved people, yeah, fire department.

47:55.160 --> 47:56.280
We boned the fuck out.

47:56.280 --> 47:59.240
But we lit a telephone pole on fire.

47:59.240 --> 48:00.880
What does it look like when it's on fire?

48:00.880 --> 48:03.400
It looked like a giant tree without leaves on fire.

48:03.400 --> 48:04.440
Wow.

48:04.440 --> 48:07.360
Did how long did service go down for?

48:07.360 --> 48:08.320
I don't know that it did.

48:08.320 --> 48:08.920
Wow.

48:08.920 --> 48:09.560
That's just a pole.

48:09.560 --> 48:10.800
The telephone doesn't go through.

48:10.800 --> 48:12.920
I think that says a lot about landlines, guys.

48:12.920 --> 48:14.080
You know what I mean?

48:14.080 --> 48:15.800
People are really against landlines these days.

48:15.800 --> 48:16.680
But that says a lot.

48:16.680 --> 48:19.680
You can light them right up on fire.

48:19.680 --> 48:22.760
Try lighting a fucking satellite on fire using your cell phone.

48:22.760 --> 48:23.480
In Long Island?

48:23.480 --> 48:24.520
There's an orange county, right?

48:24.520 --> 48:25.600
Orange county's in New Jersey.

48:25.600 --> 48:26.200
But it doesn't matter.

48:26.200 --> 48:27.000
There's counties and shit.

48:27.000 --> 48:27.400
Nassau?

48:27.400 --> 48:27.880
No, Nassau.

48:27.880 --> 48:28.520
Nassau, yeah.

48:28.520 --> 48:29.280
Nassau, yeah.

48:29.280 --> 48:31.400
Spencer, weren't you telling me that if you did it?

48:31.400 --> 48:33.600
A woo for Nassau County, yeah.

48:33.600 --> 48:35.240
Somebody likes jet skis.

48:35.240 --> 48:37.640
This is why I'm a bad host, because I'm still hung up

48:37.640 --> 48:39.560
on something, and I haven't heard anything for the last three

48:39.560 --> 48:40.040
minutes.

48:40.040 --> 48:44.240
But the didn't you tell me, Spencer,

48:44.240 --> 48:46.600
that cell phones, when you call 911 on a cell phone,

48:46.600 --> 48:49.320
it's like, if you call it on a landline,

48:49.320 --> 48:51.560
it's like, are you calling 911?

48:51.560 --> 48:54.840
You're getting connected, and then the response is like,

48:54.840 --> 48:56.840
there's a delay or something.

48:56.840 --> 48:58.080
You look confused.

48:58.080 --> 49:00.840
I didn't say any of that.

49:00.840 --> 49:02.480
Like, we're all using cell phones now, but like.

49:02.480 --> 49:04.080
I remember when you said that shit, man.

49:04.080 --> 49:05.840
Why are you bucking out of it now?

49:05.840 --> 49:06.560
There's one thing that.

49:06.560 --> 49:07.680
Dude, who is this asshole?

49:07.680 --> 49:09.080
He went, shut up about it by the state.

49:09.080 --> 49:13.240
He's like, don't call 911 on your cell phone.

49:13.240 --> 49:14.440
Got a T-shirt on and shit.

49:14.440 --> 49:16.520
I remember all of it.

49:16.520 --> 49:19.640
Dude, I'm totally a Robin.

49:19.640 --> 49:23.800
Only Robin would say shit like that.

49:23.800 --> 49:26.520
Now, do you feel like Dan is a better host than you?

49:26.520 --> 49:27.840
Yes, I do.

49:27.840 --> 49:28.880
Yes, I'm at the UCB.

49:28.880 --> 49:31.040
You're supposed to say yes and to everything.

49:31.040 --> 49:32.840
That's it.

49:32.840 --> 49:35.360
Yes, and I think his dick's bigger.

49:35.360 --> 49:36.800
So there you go.

49:36.800 --> 49:38.200
Why would I say that?

49:38.200 --> 49:40.480
I'm terrible at improv.

49:40.480 --> 49:42.040
Yes, my dick is bigger.

49:42.040 --> 49:45.880
And we're on the moon now with our giant dick.

49:45.880 --> 49:47.720
Oh no, there's no gravity.

49:47.720 --> 49:49.760
My giant dick is somewhere.

49:49.760 --> 49:51.040
Call the president.

49:51.040 --> 49:51.840
And scene.

49:51.840 --> 49:53.840
Yes, and.

49:53.840 --> 49:54.920
See how I heightened it?

49:54.920 --> 49:57.360
You got to call the president, because there's no one

49:57.360 --> 49:58.400
higher than the president.

49:58.400 --> 50:01.680
It's called UCB level fucking get it fucking get it down.

50:01.680 --> 50:02.520
Yeah, man.

50:02.520 --> 50:04.640
I was just in a really great ass cat show.

50:04.640 --> 50:05.920
Was anybody, were any of you there?

50:05.920 --> 50:08.760
Did anybody hit the double jackpot of getting into that show

50:08.760 --> 50:09.320
and this one?

50:09.320 --> 50:09.720
Wow.

50:09.720 --> 50:10.120
Really?

50:10.120 --> 50:12.120
Are you just, what?

50:12.120 --> 50:12.480
OK.

50:12.480 --> 50:13.120
They love climbing.

50:13.120 --> 50:15.320
You improv dropping or are you fucking really there, guys?

50:15.320 --> 50:16.840
There's two or three people that said yes.

50:16.840 --> 50:18.480
Sometimes people down, I don't want to be a dick,

50:18.480 --> 50:19.720
but it used to be yeast.

50:19.720 --> 50:20.640
Did you host it?

50:20.640 --> 50:23.800
Like, were you doing the monologue portion of it?

50:23.800 --> 50:25.280
He intro'd all the performers.

50:25.280 --> 50:26.760
They were there for 16 hours.

50:26.760 --> 50:27.800
Yeah, yeah.

50:27.800 --> 50:31.240
It was the only way to close out the Del Close marathon

50:31.240 --> 50:33.360
is they have Dan intro four people,

50:33.360 --> 50:35.320
and it takes up the whole 24 hours.

50:35.320 --> 50:36.400
Dan is the Michael Jordan.

50:36.400 --> 50:37.160
Yeah, that's the fact.

50:37.160 --> 50:38.360
That's how they do it.

50:38.360 --> 50:39.720
It's actually how Del Close died.

50:39.720 --> 50:43.520
I was introducing him to his doctor.

50:43.520 --> 50:45.360
You were trying to tell his doctor what was wrong.

50:45.360 --> 50:46.560
You're like, you have to understand.

50:46.560 --> 50:47.360
He has this thing.

50:47.360 --> 50:48.440
Let me tell you about things.

50:48.440 --> 50:51.560
And then the guy, there was blood coming out of his.

50:51.560 --> 50:52.400
What do you call that hole?

50:52.400 --> 50:53.360
You know what about holes?

50:53.360 --> 50:54.040
I like holes.

50:54.040 --> 50:54.640
Everything.

50:54.640 --> 50:56.120
I've been allowed to telephone, pull a fire.

50:56.120 --> 50:57.720
What's going on right now?

50:57.720 --> 51:00.520
So the premise of this IFC thing.

51:00.520 --> 51:03.120
Well, you just said, I don't want to be a dick, but UCB East.

51:03.120 --> 51:03.760
What were you going to?

51:03.760 --> 51:04.920
I didn't want to use it.

51:04.920 --> 51:05.480
I don't remember.

51:05.480 --> 51:07.080
Oh, it's something that's going to be stupid.

51:07.080 --> 51:09.680
It made sense at the moment, but now it feels weird.

51:09.680 --> 51:12.440
I think now is the time to vent why you hate UCB so much.

51:12.440 --> 51:15.240
Yeah, because they're so ungenerous.

51:15.240 --> 51:16.080
No, it's cultish.

51:16.080 --> 51:16.680
It's cultish.

51:16.680 --> 51:17.520
That's my issue with it.

51:17.520 --> 51:18.320
Yeah.

51:18.320 --> 51:20.560
Like, I had to fucking blow Matt Walsh three times just

51:20.560 --> 51:21.520
to get here tonight.

51:21.520 --> 51:23.480
Yeah, true story.

51:23.480 --> 51:25.080
And I blew him years ago doing it.

51:25.080 --> 51:26.080
This is it.

51:26.080 --> 51:27.000
And he denied it.

51:27.000 --> 51:28.080
Yeah, he's an horrible impromptu.

51:28.080 --> 51:29.680
He still denies it.

51:29.680 --> 51:31.680
He says, no, but do it again.

51:31.680 --> 51:33.160
I'm like, what are you doing?

51:33.160 --> 51:33.880
What are you doing?

51:33.880 --> 51:37.280
He's supposed to say, yes, hand reach under the ball.

51:37.280 --> 51:39.120
Fucking basic shit.

51:39.120 --> 51:40.840
That's fucking BJ's one.

51:40.840 --> 51:42.080
That's level one BJ.

51:42.080 --> 51:44.040
I gave Matt Besser one of the worst hand jobs

51:44.040 --> 51:44.600
I've ever given.

51:44.600 --> 51:45.920
Heard about that hand job.

51:45.920 --> 51:47.080
I saw it's one man show.

51:47.080 --> 51:49.600
Bad is Besser's bad HJs.

51:49.600 --> 51:51.920
That's all that.

51:51.920 --> 51:55.360
The show that we're doing on Wednesday, which I think it's

51:55.360 --> 51:58.760
already, if you didn't move on the tweet that I sent out,

51:58.760 --> 52:01.000
then I just feel bad for you.

52:01.000 --> 52:04.000
I sent out a tweet today because it's in another small space.

52:04.000 --> 52:07.240
So I'm sure it was like, why am I being so cocky?

52:07.240 --> 52:09.120
Well, because it's not really cocky.

52:09.120 --> 52:09.840
It doesn't feel cocky at all.

52:09.840 --> 52:10.520
It doesn't feel cocky at all.

52:10.520 --> 52:11.400
It feels sad.

52:11.400 --> 52:14.920
And it's like watching a guy brag about the size of his.

52:14.920 --> 52:16.760
When you're hosting the show, they say,

52:16.760 --> 52:20.080
Dan, when we open the show, your camera is camera two.

52:20.080 --> 52:21.760
You have to look right into camera two.

52:21.760 --> 52:23.200
Are you still going to look at the floor?

52:23.200 --> 52:23.760
I don't know.

52:23.760 --> 52:24.680
I'm not an idiot.

52:24.680 --> 52:25.920
I'm camera twos on the floor.

52:25.920 --> 52:27.520
They know what they're doing.

52:27.520 --> 52:29.040
Guys, it's professionally produced.

52:29.040 --> 52:30.360
They know what they're doing.

52:33.560 --> 52:34.880
I have no idea where it is.

52:34.880 --> 52:35.920
106 in park.

52:35.920 --> 52:37.480
Don't line up now, guys.

52:37.480 --> 52:38.200
You'll get in.

52:38.200 --> 52:40.240
Now, Dan, we're sitting next to a guy that seems to be.

52:40.240 --> 52:41.400
Don't spend the weekend there.

52:41.400 --> 52:43.240
He's got a great baritone voice.

52:43.240 --> 52:43.740
Yeah.

52:43.740 --> 52:44.240
Do I?

52:44.240 --> 52:45.240
Do I?

52:45.240 --> 52:46.960
He's not uncomfortable getting up and walking around

52:46.960 --> 52:47.760
and working the room.

52:47.760 --> 52:48.640
This whole thing?

52:48.640 --> 52:49.760
Yeah.

52:49.760 --> 52:51.480
How did you listen to this guy?

52:51.480 --> 52:55.720
Because I think that one of the guys at IFC, not the production

52:55.720 --> 52:59.240
company that's making the pilot, I think they're always like,

52:59.240 --> 53:01.680
IFC is so excited that you're hosting.

53:01.680 --> 53:04.000
So I'm like, oh, that means you hate me.

53:04.000 --> 53:12.480
But so I think maybe someone at IFC, maybe my dad called him.

53:12.480 --> 53:13.280
No.

53:13.280 --> 53:14.840
And was like, listen to me.

53:14.840 --> 53:15.840
This son works hard.

53:15.840 --> 53:16.880
Wait a minute.

53:16.880 --> 53:18.920
Wait, our dads were allowed to do that shit?

53:18.920 --> 53:19.420
Yeah.

53:19.420 --> 53:20.680
I've called my dad off for years.

53:20.680 --> 53:21.560
We were like, don't do it.

53:21.560 --> 53:22.060
Don't do it.

53:22.060 --> 53:22.840
No, you shouldn't.

53:22.840 --> 53:23.400
Oh my god.

53:23.400 --> 53:23.960
I mean, idiot.

53:23.960 --> 53:26.720
Because if my dad calls you, you will fucking break down

53:26.720 --> 53:27.400
there for a while.

53:27.400 --> 53:30.680
Do you know that they are capable of driving you all the way

53:30.680 --> 53:32.160
to McDonald's or school?

53:32.160 --> 53:34.280
And you don't have to get out a block away.

53:34.280 --> 53:35.360
That's a choice you made.

53:35.360 --> 53:36.200
I didn't know that.

53:36.200 --> 53:38.040
When you are a flawed person because you visit,

53:38.040 --> 53:39.920
you can rekindle that.

53:39.920 --> 53:42.000
Dad, drive me all the way to McDonald's.

53:42.000 --> 53:43.840
Yeah, wow.

53:43.840 --> 53:46.720
Take me back to the beginning of that story.

53:46.720 --> 53:47.200
You know what?

53:47.200 --> 53:48.480
Your friends will see your dad.

53:48.480 --> 53:50.200
You want him to see you disappear places.

53:50.200 --> 53:50.760
I get it.

53:50.760 --> 53:52.800
Before you can drive, you don't want your friends

53:52.800 --> 53:54.240
to know your parents brought you.

53:54.240 --> 53:56.600
You want them to think you just fucking, maybe you're

53:56.600 --> 53:59.960
like in that awesome movie where they jump leapers, jumpers.

53:59.960 --> 54:00.460
Leapers?

54:00.460 --> 54:02.080
Jumpers?

54:02.080 --> 54:03.720
What's that movie where they jump?

54:03.720 --> 54:04.320
What's that movie?

54:04.320 --> 54:05.520
I think it's Leapers.

54:05.520 --> 54:09.600
Was that leaping movie where they jump?

54:09.600 --> 54:11.280
What's the fucking name of that movie?

54:11.280 --> 54:13.200
The sequel is Leapers 2.

54:13.200 --> 54:16.080
The jumpers.

54:16.080 --> 54:19.040
No, because sometimes I get loopers and jumpers confused,

54:19.040 --> 54:20.440
but you don't want to do that shit, man.

54:20.440 --> 54:21.280
No, no, don't look.

54:21.280 --> 54:22.280
Your fucking brain always plays.

54:22.280 --> 54:24.400
You don't watch those movies back to back either.

54:24.400 --> 54:26.800
It's like fucking ammonium bleach, guys.

54:26.800 --> 54:28.000
Leapers can't be jumpers.

54:28.000 --> 54:29.000
Is your dad still around?

54:29.000 --> 54:29.480
Is he alive?

54:29.480 --> 54:30.240
Yeah, he's a leaper.

54:30.240 --> 54:31.800
Are you close with your dad?

54:31.800 --> 54:34.680
I was, and then he fucking leaped away for a pack of smokes.

54:34.680 --> 54:35.560
That was 20.

54:35.560 --> 54:38.360
When I was 20, he was like, I'm going to leap for a pack of smokes.

54:38.360 --> 54:39.360
Yeah, we're close enough.

54:39.360 --> 54:39.840
Are you close?

54:39.840 --> 54:40.760
Are you friends?

54:40.760 --> 54:42.360
Well, we're not friends.

54:42.360 --> 54:42.800
We have a-

54:42.800 --> 54:43.400
Can you get along?

54:43.400 --> 54:44.000
Are you pals?

54:44.000 --> 54:44.760
Oh, Jesus Christ.

54:44.760 --> 54:46.440
What's going on here right now?

54:46.440 --> 54:49.800
We're going to cry a little bit now. I don't know, I mean, we could be close.

54:49.800 --> 54:50.800
We don't know you.

54:50.800 --> 54:51.800
I don't know.

54:51.800 --> 54:54.600
I mean, do you call them up once in a while?

54:54.600 --> 55:00.920
Yeah, I call them sometimes and for my mom, and then help pick up, so that I got a fucking,

55:00.920 --> 55:02.200
you know, talk to him a little bit.

55:02.200 --> 55:03.440
What is it about that?

55:03.440 --> 55:05.880
I got to run interference, you know, I got to be like, yeah, yeah, that's good.

55:05.880 --> 55:07.160
Was mom around?

55:07.160 --> 55:09.680
Because I have something I'd like to communicate to a human.

55:09.680 --> 55:10.800
So you're close to mom, but not-

55:10.800 --> 55:16.080
That's basically it. I don't know.

55:16.080 --> 55:20.520
Anyway, if you guys have ever seen Leapers, dude, that movie is fucking-

55:20.520 --> 55:21.520
Leapers can't be choosers?

55:21.520 --> 55:23.240
They cannot. That's true.

55:23.240 --> 55:25.840
That is sound advice, especially for the young people in the room.

55:25.840 --> 55:27.520
If you're looking for a leaper, don't be picky.

55:27.520 --> 55:29.000
What is it about your dad that creates the distance?

55:29.000 --> 55:29.520
Well, what-

55:29.520 --> 55:32.280
I don't know, he's a fucking Italian guy, you know what I mean?

55:32.280 --> 55:33.120
He's Italian.

55:33.120 --> 55:33.760
He's Italian.

55:33.760 --> 55:34.520
Yeah, he's Italian.

55:34.520 --> 55:35.400
He pronounces it wrong.

55:35.400 --> 55:37.640
Yeah, yeah, he's so Italian, he gets it wrong.

55:37.640 --> 55:39.920
All Italians pronounce everything wrong.

55:39.920 --> 55:42.080
It's not prosciutto, it's prosciutto.

55:42.080 --> 55:43.600
But that's just New York.

55:43.600 --> 55:46.080
That's just Goombat's behaviors, what that is.

55:46.080 --> 55:46.760
You got the football-

55:46.760 --> 55:49.360
I have a half Goombat side, that's a little Goombat's.

55:49.360 --> 55:50.080
You know what I mean?

55:50.080 --> 55:50.560
Foombats.

55:50.560 --> 55:53.520
You guys, the one lady who cheered for Nassau County is like,

55:53.520 --> 55:56.200
he fucking gets it.

55:56.200 --> 56:00.240
Everybody else is like, man, I don't know, Williamsburg doesn't have her.

56:00.240 --> 56:02.520
Are you a New York Italian all the way across the board?

56:02.520 --> 56:03.880
Yeah, no, not all the way.

56:03.880 --> 56:05.800
The other half is Jew.

56:05.800 --> 56:09.480
Yeah, I'm sorry, don't leave.

56:09.480 --> 56:11.480
I never say you're a Jew in a crowded theater.

56:11.480 --> 56:14.880
I learned that and I fucked it up.

56:14.880 --> 56:16.600
There's a fact of what we say.

56:16.600 --> 56:19.040
So your mom is Jewish?

56:19.040 --> 56:23.520
My dad's Italian and I'm in therapy.

56:23.520 --> 56:25.960
I'm actually not in therapy.

56:25.960 --> 56:27.520
It's fine, it worked out fine.

56:27.520 --> 56:29.640
You're closer to Jewish mom than Italian dad?

56:29.640 --> 56:32.120
Yeah, just because my mom's like, you know,

56:32.120 --> 56:34.400
like she can like talk and shit, you know.

56:34.400 --> 56:37.440
My dad's like, my dad just says like platitudes,

56:37.440 --> 56:38.760
like he just looks like a handbook.

56:38.760 --> 56:41.120
He's like, hey, he calls me his Hollywood son.

56:41.120 --> 56:42.480
He's like, hey, that's my Hollywood son.

56:42.480 --> 56:44.280
I'm like, I've never really lived in Hollywood.

56:44.280 --> 56:45.280
You know what I mean?

56:45.280 --> 56:45.880
He's like, what are you doing?

56:45.880 --> 56:46.560
You making a movie?

56:46.560 --> 56:47.160
What are you hanging out?

56:47.160 --> 56:48.560
I'm paying him like, his mom around?

56:48.560 --> 56:49.240
Is mom there?

56:49.240 --> 56:53.800
Because I just want to talk to like a fucking normal thing,

56:53.800 --> 56:55.040
somebody normal.

56:55.040 --> 56:57.800
I don't want to keep living through this giggy cartoon

56:57.800 --> 56:58.560
or whatever you're doing.

56:58.560 --> 57:01.720
Hey, look, I got a case of the Mondays.

57:01.720 --> 57:03.440
Already, guys, I don't want to freak out,

57:03.440 --> 57:04.400
but I'm pretty contagious.

57:04.400 --> 57:06.360
I got the Mondays.

57:06.360 --> 57:07.800
Or is that Kathy or Ziggy?

57:07.800 --> 57:08.600
I'm sorry.

57:08.600 --> 57:10.040
Did you ever hug Garfield?

57:10.040 --> 57:11.280
Jesus Christ.

57:11.280 --> 57:12.000
Yeah, hug him.

57:12.000 --> 57:13.400
I mean, yeah, hug him.

57:13.400 --> 57:13.920
I hug him.

57:13.920 --> 57:15.560
You never like on a holiday, I love your dad?

57:15.560 --> 57:16.360
No, I love him.

57:16.360 --> 57:16.880
I hug him.

57:16.880 --> 57:17.480
But do you say it?

57:17.480 --> 57:17.960
Do you say it?

57:17.960 --> 57:20.040
Yeah, I say I love you, but put mom on.

57:20.040 --> 57:20.600
You know what I mean?

57:20.600 --> 57:22.280
Like, I don't hate to do that.

57:22.280 --> 57:24.080
Just I want to fucking talk to him that much.

57:24.080 --> 57:25.600
I don't tell my parents I love them.

57:25.600 --> 57:28.720
You know, I tell your mom, I'm just kidding.

57:28.720 --> 57:30.640
I stopped myself.

57:30.640 --> 57:32.200
That was a fucking low.

57:32.200 --> 57:35.080
That was a real long island moment, guys.

57:35.080 --> 57:37.080
You're turning into your father.

57:37.080 --> 57:39.320
You don't know what I'm turning into.

57:39.320 --> 57:39.800
Don't hit me.

57:39.800 --> 57:40.800
Don't hit me.

57:40.800 --> 57:41.800
Get out of here.

57:41.800 --> 57:43.240
You're not my real dad.

57:43.240 --> 57:45.080
Oh, son, I'm just sitting here in tidy whiteies

57:45.080 --> 57:46.440
and fucking black dress socks.

57:46.440 --> 57:48.160
I'm like, what happened?

57:48.160 --> 57:50.000
Get out of here.

57:50.000 --> 57:52.120
See you at Zyzon.

57:52.120 --> 57:54.400
I will text I love you too.

57:54.400 --> 57:54.800
Wow.

57:54.800 --> 57:55.280
In response.

57:55.280 --> 57:56.880
Your parents can read text?

57:56.880 --> 57:58.360
What are they 30?

57:58.360 --> 58:02.160
My mom just learned.

58:02.160 --> 58:05.160
I think she was only direct tweeting me.

58:05.160 --> 58:06.280
But I think.

58:06.280 --> 58:09.600
If your mom can tweet, my mom's like, explain the Twitter.

58:09.600 --> 58:10.560
I'm like, you'll hate it.

58:10.560 --> 58:11.200
You'll hate it.

58:11.200 --> 58:12.400
I don't want her near Twitter.

58:12.400 --> 58:14.760
My mom has a locked account.

58:14.760 --> 58:16.960
So I guess she can read my tweets.

58:16.960 --> 58:17.760
Wow.

58:17.760 --> 58:18.680
And then she'll direct.

58:18.680 --> 58:21.000
She would direct tweet me, which

58:21.000 --> 58:22.880
comes to my phone as a text message.

58:22.880 --> 58:25.320
And I would just direct tweet her back and go,

58:25.320 --> 58:26.520
just you can text me.

58:26.520 --> 58:27.800
And we can just go back and forth.

58:27.800 --> 58:30.320
And it's less advanced than what you're doing.

58:30.320 --> 58:31.160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

58:31.160 --> 58:32.120
She's gone.

58:32.120 --> 58:34.200
She's gone past the easy thing.

58:34.200 --> 58:35.560
Yeah, she's like appearing to me

58:35.560 --> 58:39.520
like the ghost in the beginning of 2010.

58:39.520 --> 58:41.440
The guy was like, oh, I'm a being of energy

58:41.440 --> 58:42.880
from the first movie.

58:42.880 --> 58:43.840
2010.

58:43.840 --> 58:44.600
Hold on.

58:44.600 --> 58:46.160
The year we made contact?

58:46.160 --> 58:47.320
Oh, contact.

58:47.320 --> 58:50.000
No, no, no.

58:50.000 --> 58:52.400
No, 2010, the year we made contact,

58:52.400 --> 58:54.800
is not the making of the movie contact.

58:54.800 --> 58:56.000
No, that movie contact.

58:56.000 --> 58:57.320
I never really saw that movie.

58:57.320 --> 58:59.920
But I did like that new Matthew McConaughey ghost

58:59.920 --> 59:02.280
space movie that just came out.

59:02.280 --> 59:04.400
I'd really like to see 2009, the reason

59:04.400 --> 59:07.520
we made contact, because I have some questions.

59:07.520 --> 59:08.840
No, I've seen First Contact.

59:08.840 --> 59:10.760
It's a fine Star Trek film.

59:10.760 --> 59:13.960
But there was a sequel to 2001 called 2010.

59:13.960 --> 59:14.280
Wow.

59:14.280 --> 59:15.440
Is that like The Wiz?

59:15.440 --> 59:17.840
It's terrible.

59:17.840 --> 59:20.520
Oh, so it's like The Wiz.

59:20.520 --> 59:23.440
In that it's based on the, they didn't pay for the rights

59:23.440 --> 59:24.800
to 2001, the movie.

59:24.800 --> 59:26.440
They based it on the original books.

59:26.440 --> 59:29.480
It's like, oh, look, it's Dorothy, I guess.

59:29.480 --> 59:30.840
Right, right, right.

59:30.840 --> 59:33.280
But the public domain version, she's not allowed to.

59:33.280 --> 59:35.600
Yes, yeah.

59:35.600 --> 59:36.800
She's from Utah.

59:36.800 --> 59:40.160
The fuck was a, oh, my, my, my, I don't know.

59:40.160 --> 59:41.760
How did the monkeys start that fire?

59:41.760 --> 59:43.040
Oh.

59:43.040 --> 59:44.680
Well, it could be flying monkeys.

59:44.680 --> 59:46.840
I mean, I'm just saying, we're talking about The Wiz.

59:46.840 --> 59:47.840
They didn't, they didn't.

59:47.840 --> 59:49.840
I told you, I looked it up on Snopes, it was,

59:49.840 --> 59:51.480
it was, didn't I already say?

59:51.480 --> 59:53.000
Tell me about the Great Fire of 1830.

59:53.000 --> 59:53.560
Yeah.

59:53.560 --> 59:54.520
It was Dominicans.

59:54.520 --> 59:57.880
And they were, oh, it was, it was, I know.

59:57.880 --> 59:59.720
It was, it was, exactly.

59:59.720 --> 01:00:02.480
Just so you get a sense of how racist America was back then.

01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:05.440
Dan, if I can be quite honest, we deal in honesty here.

01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:07.680
Backstage, Dan was coming down on the Dominicans

01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:08.520
pretty hard back stage.

01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:09.400
Pretty hard.

01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:12.000
I just, like, well, I, like, like.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.920
What does your fucking beef with the Dominicans?

01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:15.880
Well, are they really a republic?

01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:17.880
Wow.

01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:20.080
You make a lot, look, you're making a lot of sense right now,

01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:20.640
Dan.

01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:22.480
Do you get to just throw that word around?

01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:22.800
Yeah, agree.

01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:24.560
We're the Dominican Republic.

01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:27.000
OK, I'm, I'm the Dan Harmon Republic.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.760
Yeah, yeah, me too.

01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:29.080
Yeah.

01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:31.800
I mean, yeah, I mean, come on.

01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:34.560
You're just, you're just, you're just, you're just a minico.

01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:35.560
You know what this is, guys?

01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:37.400
I don't want to be, I don't want to be,

01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:39.720
I don't want to get involved here, but he's part Puerto Rican.

01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:41.600
That's where this anger comes from.

01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:42.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.200
Sure, the Puerto Ricans and the Mankins, you're not going to get,

01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:46.400
because it's a PR, DR, there's a thing.

01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:47.840
I'm telling you, that's a real fucking,

01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:51.040
if you weren't all so fucking white,

01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:53.440
if you ever talked to the people in the neighborhoods

01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:56.400
you live in, you would learn that there's a lot

01:00:56.400 --> 01:00:58.920
of inter-race hatred, and you don't have to feel bad about it,

01:00:58.920 --> 01:01:00.280
because you didn't cause this.

01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:01.080
You're an Italian.

01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:05.680
So I'm assuming that you're a jet versus a shark.

01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:08.280
Oh yeah, I'm a jet all the way, baby.

01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:11.280
From my first cigarette to my last dying day!

01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:12.440
I don't think you can get out.

01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:13.320
You can't get out.

01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:17.800
Ta-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.

01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:19.080
This got really gay.

01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:20.960
Do you have a rocket in your pocket?

01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:22.280
Do I have a rocket in my pockets?

01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:23.320
Yeah.

01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:25.520
We're on stage, my friend.

01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:26.880
These are backstage conversations.

01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:30.160
When I watch, what's it called?

01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:31.120
What's that story?

01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:32.360
I don't know.

01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:35.280
The absence just fucking kicked in.

01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:37.320
All right, OK, so yeah, we were just talking about it.

01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:38.840
Let's just be clear about this.

01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:43.720
Somebody gave you a fucking Jane, what looks basically.

01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:45.640
All right, so somebody, it's Jane?

01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:46.240
Jane.

01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:46.920
Jay?

01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:47.920
Jane.

01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:49.080
Jane, first shot.

01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:51.680
All right, whatever your name is, Jane.

01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:52.320
It's Jane.

01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:55.200
This looks like some shady olive oil in a jar,

01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:56.800
and he's just drinking it.

01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:58.920
You just fucking bought, like, Crisco, and were like,

01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:01.000
I made an absence, let's see how much I'll drink.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.320
And he's fucking pounding that shit.

01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:04.120
Take a swing at this.

01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:06.360
No, because it could be LSD in there or something.

01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:10.160
Well, Jane's a trusted, like, member of the Harmontown family.

01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:10.720
She is?

01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:11.240
Yeah.

01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:12.720
Oh, that sounds legit.

01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:19.960
I mean, if Harmontown trusts her, well, we're a republic.

01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:23.000
If she has the Harmontown FDA approval,

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.680
then how could she not be OK?

01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:28.040
Why would she want to see you guys strip your balls off

01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:29.680
up here?

01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:31.360
I believe you, Jane.

01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:32.480
Take a big swing off that.

01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:38.880
Fuck, dude.

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:41.000
Fucking, hey, that's like gasoline, Jane.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.840
You could absolutely run a lawn mower around that.

01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:45.080
Holy fuck, Nuggets.

01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:47.280
I'll do one little baby sip.

01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:51.840
No, that's like, wow, that's like that.

01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:53.840
What's that line in the naked gun when he's like,

01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:55.000
you know, it's like, drink and drain,

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:56.480
or it'll clean you out inside.

01:02:56.480 --> 01:02:58.320
Yeah, that's exactly it. Take a sip of that.

01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:02.120
Yeah, I've got bad experiences with Jane's concoctions.

01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:04.640
And I have to write the show that we're taping on Wednesday

01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:06.960
tonight, or I just will never be written.

01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:07.600
Oh.

01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:10.320
Good night.

01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:13.600
Well, Jane's got a deep voice.

01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:15.560
That's good.

01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:18.520
So advice on, like, because you worked with one

01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:19.560
of the great TV hosts.

01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:22.280
It took me up pretty easy.

01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:23.720
We have to do this thing on Wednesday.

01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:25.200
This guy was so drunk last night.

01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:26.920
The premise of the pilot that we're doing

01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:30.880
is that I am the host, which is already kind of a premise.

01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:32.360
First of all, Dan's a great host.

01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:34.240
So enough with this bullshit.

01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:36.280
Second of all, the premise of the pilot

01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:39.440
is that he is it so Rupert Murdoch's son?

01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:40.520
Is that fucking it up?

01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:43.360
No, I didn't hear the subplot version of the show

01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:44.840
you guys developed before you got fired.

01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:46.520
Yeah.

01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:47.800
I'm just talking about this now.

01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:49.680
And I come out, I do a big top dance number,

01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:51.160
and everyone loves me.

01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:51.600
What do you mean?

01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:53.880
I don't have the job.

01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:56.480
And there I am, just me and the people.

01:03:56.480 --> 01:03:58.840
And I'm singing a song.

01:03:58.840 --> 01:04:00.000
Papa, can you hear me?

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:00.720
It seems perfect.

01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:02.160
This is for IFC.

01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:03.520
I said, top dance number.

01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:06.480
Your deal was about to close on your anti-vax blog,

01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:09.120
and they're like, this isn't going to work for you.

01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:12.080
They saw my fucking, they saw my selfies

01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:13.200
with fucking Jenny McCarthy.

01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:13.800
Like, she knows.

01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:14.640
She gets it.

01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:15.480
She gets it.

01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:16.640
Well, who's second on the list?

01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:17.320
I'm just kidding, guys.

01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:18.240
I have a selfie stick.

01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:19.480
I'm not an idiot.

01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:20.920
I'm not going to take a selfie with Jenny

01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:22.280
McCarthy without a selfie stick.

01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:24.480
What's, what do we, I mean?

01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:25.320
Good try, Jane.

01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:26.360
Good try.

01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:29.160
Like, what, when you're doing, are there do's and don'ts,

01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:30.120
like, on The Daily Show?

01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:31.680
So John would have, you know, he's

01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:33.720
got a guest in every episode virtually.

01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:34.640
They're coming out.

01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:37.640
Like, what, how did you, how did you prep for,

01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:41.000
like, like, how tightly did he adhere to a plan that

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.280
was done through pre-interviews and stuff like that?

01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:49.640
It depends on the guests.

01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:51.400
I mean, the thing that was interesting about The Daily

01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:52.280
Show.

01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:54.280
Dumb-dubba-dumb-dumb-dubba-dumb-dubba-dumb.

01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:55.980
The thing that was interesting about The Daily Show.

01:04:55.980 --> 01:04:57.400
Dumb-dubba-dumb-dumb.

01:04:57.400 --> 01:04:58.880
One pair.

01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:00.380
One grey suit.

01:05:00.380 --> 01:05:04.200
Look, I'm more of a kill-borne man myself.

01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:05.280
That's on The Daily Show.

01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:07.000
I love what, was Daily.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:08.320
I love when they, I love when like they crowd.

01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:09.200
He's already fucked up.

01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:11.400
I love that they crowd groan, you know, they're like,

01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:13.120
oh, dude, he's dead kill-borne.

01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:14.220
Take a big one, take it.

01:05:14.220 --> 01:05:14.840
Go, go.

01:05:14.840 --> 01:05:16.280
Big one.

01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:16.980
Oh, Jane.

01:05:16.980 --> 01:05:17.560
Muscle up.

01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:19.940
I have a feeling Jane could be fuckin' Jim,

01:05:19.940 --> 01:05:23.140
And I'm not going to know at the end of the night.

01:05:23.140 --> 01:05:24.300
Well, funny you should say that.

01:05:24.300 --> 01:05:25.420
I'm just kidding, guys.

01:05:25.420 --> 01:05:27.300
I know gender is not a thing anymore.

01:05:27.300 --> 01:05:29.220
I get it.

01:05:29.220 --> 01:05:29.820
I'm kidding.

01:05:29.820 --> 01:05:32.660
Jane, John, it's all shoulders up.

01:05:32.660 --> 01:05:33.620
I get it.

01:05:33.620 --> 01:05:35.220
If you think you're a lady, you're a lady.

01:05:35.220 --> 01:05:37.380
I read the papers.

01:05:37.380 --> 01:05:38.020
This is terrible.

01:05:38.020 --> 01:05:40.820
Jane actually is a transgender.

01:05:40.820 --> 01:05:41.700
It's not terrible.

01:05:41.700 --> 01:05:42.660
I think it's fantastic.

01:05:42.660 --> 01:05:46.140
I'm all for Jane being transgender.

01:05:46.140 --> 01:05:48.540
My only issue with transgender is they say you're the only

01:05:48.540 --> 01:05:50.020
question you can't ask is, do you have a dick?

01:05:50.020 --> 01:05:52.420
And I keep saying, that's the only question I have.

01:05:52.420 --> 01:05:55.500
I can't ask that, then let's not talk about it.

01:05:55.500 --> 01:05:59.220
Did you see our mutual friend, John Oliver, this week

01:05:59.220 --> 01:06:00.820
tonight about the transgender thing?

01:06:00.820 --> 01:06:01.320
Yes.

01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:02.940
Were you kind of like, like, surprised?

01:06:02.940 --> 01:06:05.540
I found myself feeling ashamed right away because already

01:06:05.540 --> 01:06:08.620
it's like, oh, like, I was patting myself on the back

01:06:08.620 --> 01:06:11.620
just for getting through the door of like, of not, you know,

01:06:11.620 --> 01:06:12.780
not bullying and all this stuff.

01:06:12.780 --> 01:06:15.580
And it's like, and now they showed Barbara Walters going

01:06:15.580 --> 01:06:17.940
like, so under your pants, what's going on?

01:06:17.940 --> 01:06:19.900
And it was kind of like, well, that's me.

01:06:19.900 --> 01:06:20.580
That's me.

01:06:20.580 --> 01:06:23.700
I thought I was being progressive by asking all the details.

01:06:23.700 --> 01:06:25.460
I was like, oh, no, that doesn't make any sense.

01:06:25.460 --> 01:06:27.020
Why would I do that?

01:06:27.020 --> 01:06:28.700
I'm constantly playing catch up.

01:06:28.700 --> 01:06:31.740
I always feel like, I just feel like this barbarian.

01:06:31.740 --> 01:06:37.020
I feel like this old, like, sad gorilla at the zoo that's just

01:06:37.020 --> 01:06:40.540
like, keeps crushing kittens they bring to it.

01:06:40.540 --> 01:06:42.660
Because it's replacing one that knows sign language.

01:06:42.660 --> 01:06:45.820
But I just keep asking for ice cream and killing.

01:06:45.820 --> 01:06:46.980
I think that's OK.

01:06:46.980 --> 01:06:49.260
Every zoo needs this gorilla that kills kittens.

01:06:49.260 --> 01:06:50.100
You know what I mean?

01:06:50.100 --> 01:06:52.820
You know how many fucking extra kittens they have at the zoo?

01:06:52.820 --> 01:06:53.300
You have no idea.

01:06:53.300 --> 01:06:54.660
It's a real problem.

01:06:54.660 --> 01:06:56.100
Well, New York still has a problem.

01:06:56.100 --> 01:06:58.060
That comes out of our tax dollars, guys.

01:06:58.060 --> 01:06:58.980
Feeding those kittens.

01:06:58.980 --> 01:07:00.900
I'm not paying for that shit.

01:07:00.900 --> 01:07:03.460
That's why we were like, gorilla's killing them.

01:07:03.460 --> 01:07:05.260
You're already drunk on absent, aren't you?

01:07:05.260 --> 01:07:08.620
I don't know what I'm drunk on, but that shit's fucking dangerous.

01:07:08.620 --> 01:07:11.820
I seriously feel like I could have just taken a shot of fucking

01:07:11.820 --> 01:07:15.860
golf, like, you know, 87, whatever.

01:07:15.860 --> 01:07:17.980
What's a fuel, like, 88, 9?

01:07:17.980 --> 01:07:21.100
I like that you went back to the 70s for a gas station.

01:07:21.100 --> 01:07:23.740
Is golf not a thing anymore?

01:07:23.740 --> 01:07:25.620
No, golf's a fucking thing, guys.

01:07:25.620 --> 01:07:26.540
Fuck you.

01:07:26.540 --> 01:07:27.620
Golf still exists.

01:07:27.620 --> 01:07:28.540
Fuck you.

01:07:28.540 --> 01:07:31.060
I'll tell you right now, I don't drink from fucking BP spouts.

01:07:31.060 --> 01:07:32.060
Am I right?

01:07:32.060 --> 01:07:32.620
Huh?

01:07:32.620 --> 01:07:33.140
Yeah.

01:07:33.140 --> 01:07:35.300
Don't support that.

01:07:35.300 --> 01:07:36.500
Don't support it.

01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:38.380
See, you got to get in the crowd on my side.

01:07:38.380 --> 01:07:39.220
No, yeah.

01:07:39.220 --> 01:07:41.340
Those stunts of bitches, yeah.

01:07:41.340 --> 01:07:43.100
I'm like, good gas, like Exxon.

01:07:43.100 --> 01:07:45.020
There you go.

01:07:45.020 --> 01:07:47.300
The good people over at Exxon.

01:07:47.300 --> 01:07:49.900
They don't kill fucking dolphins and shit.

01:07:49.900 --> 01:07:51.940
They just fucking make my SUV hum.

01:07:51.940 --> 01:07:53.700
You're a standard oil guy from way back.

01:07:53.700 --> 01:07:56.220
I'm a big standard oil, man.

01:07:56.220 --> 01:08:00.940
That's why I hate these filtered cigarettes, nonsense.

01:08:00.940 --> 01:08:02.860
If I wanted a filter, I wanted a fucking...

01:08:02.860 --> 01:08:03.940
You like your lucky strikes?

01:08:03.940 --> 01:08:06.980
I like my Paul Mauls, my lucky strikes.

01:08:06.980 --> 01:08:08.820
My Virginia Slims wide.

01:08:08.820 --> 01:08:10.180
I like my Virginia Slims.

01:08:10.180 --> 01:08:10.820
That's hard to get.

01:08:10.820 --> 01:08:11.380
Unfiltered.

01:08:11.380 --> 01:08:12.940
That's hard to get.

01:08:12.940 --> 01:08:16.060
I like my Virginia Wides unfiltered.

01:08:16.060 --> 01:08:18.180
You guys too young for that shit.

01:08:18.180 --> 01:08:23.140
How does a host move from one topic to another?

01:08:23.140 --> 01:08:26.140
I don't know.

01:08:26.140 --> 01:08:26.860
Music.

01:08:26.860 --> 01:08:30.660
Yo, yo, yo, host, yo, yo, yo.

01:08:30.660 --> 01:08:32.140
I'm going to moderate discussion.

01:08:32.140 --> 01:08:34.780
Gonna fuck your mama so hard I give her a concussion.

01:08:34.780 --> 01:08:35.500
Give us some.

01:08:38.500 --> 01:08:39.260
That was good.

01:08:39.260 --> 01:08:40.100
You were helping.

01:08:40.100 --> 01:08:41.300
Listen, I'm going to tell you right now.

01:08:41.300 --> 01:08:43.540
If I knew how to go from one thing to another,

01:08:43.540 --> 01:08:45.660
I might have gotten the job.

01:08:45.660 --> 01:08:46.860
The wrong guy to ask.

01:08:46.860 --> 01:08:48.580
But you want...

01:08:48.580 --> 01:08:49.660
I'm actually just kind of curious.

01:08:49.660 --> 01:08:50.260
I don't know.

01:08:50.260 --> 01:08:50.980
I'm not curious.

01:08:50.980 --> 01:08:54.020
I decided at some point that the angle was going to be

01:08:54.020 --> 01:08:55.140
that I was going to get advice from you

01:08:55.140 --> 01:08:56.060
and how to be a good host.

01:08:56.060 --> 01:08:58.940
But obviously, that's not what's organically pleasing.

01:08:58.940 --> 01:09:00.180
It's stupid and I'm clinging to it.

01:09:00.180 --> 01:09:01.820
All you have to do is be yourself.

01:09:01.820 --> 01:09:04.220
My advice to you is to give me the advice to go with the flow.

01:09:04.220 --> 01:09:04.900
Just hold on.

01:09:04.900 --> 01:09:06.820
Just be yourself.

01:09:06.820 --> 01:09:08.540
This dude's so fucking likable, right?

01:09:08.540 --> 01:09:10.220
If he's just himself, yeah.

01:09:10.220 --> 01:09:11.780
Here's the thing.

01:09:11.780 --> 01:09:13.020
I want to take a moment.

01:09:13.020 --> 01:09:13.820
I want to take a moment.

01:09:13.820 --> 01:09:16.660
Just think about 9-11 for a second.

01:09:16.660 --> 01:09:17.220
All right, cool.

01:09:17.220 --> 01:09:19.380
Now I'm just moving on to the host thing.

01:09:19.380 --> 01:09:20.660
I like this.

01:09:20.660 --> 01:09:24.660
No, I'm saying the whole point is if people always

01:09:24.660 --> 01:09:26.500
make an adjustment because they're on TV,

01:09:26.500 --> 01:09:27.820
people always make an adjustment.

01:09:27.820 --> 01:09:28.580
They're like, oh, do that.

01:09:28.580 --> 01:09:30.060
Now I got to be Dan Hormann on TV.

01:09:30.060 --> 01:09:32.580
No, if you do that, you're going to feel like a weird version

01:09:32.580 --> 01:09:33.020
of yourself.

01:09:33.020 --> 01:09:33.660
Just be you.

01:09:33.660 --> 01:09:34.620
Just be you.

01:09:34.620 --> 01:09:36.420
Maybe dress like an adult.

01:09:36.420 --> 01:09:37.260
But other than that...

01:09:37.260 --> 01:09:40.340
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

01:09:40.340 --> 01:09:41.500
Just be you, dude.

01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:43.420
I mean, don't fuck around.

01:09:43.420 --> 01:09:45.140
Don't fuck with fucking you.

01:09:45.140 --> 01:09:46.420
This is why there's people here.

01:09:46.420 --> 01:09:47.940
Like, in other words, people like you.

01:09:47.940 --> 01:09:49.340
And I feel like if you try.

01:09:49.340 --> 01:09:52.980
I learned that back, I was doing a show back in, like,

01:09:52.980 --> 01:09:54.620
with Sammy Davis Jr. a couple of years ago.

01:09:54.620 --> 01:09:58.540
And it was just a small jazz number.

01:09:58.540 --> 01:10:00.060
It was a little jazz number, you may have heard of it.

01:10:00.060 --> 01:10:03.260
It was called White Nights.

01:10:03.260 --> 01:10:04.500
It was me and Gregory Hines.

01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:05.500
Gregory Hines?

01:10:05.500 --> 01:10:07.540
And Baryshekov.

01:10:07.540 --> 01:10:09.260
Yeah, Sammy, you were the third white guy.

01:10:09.260 --> 01:10:11.940
Sammy Davis dropped by to just check in to make sure

01:10:11.940 --> 01:10:12.780
my moves were right.

01:10:12.780 --> 01:10:13.540
Were you in White Nights?

01:10:13.540 --> 01:10:14.620
Yeah, I was in White Nights.

01:10:14.620 --> 01:10:15.780
A lot of people don't know that.

01:10:15.780 --> 01:10:17.340
I played The Baby.

01:10:17.340 --> 01:10:20.060
Yeah, yeah, there's a scene where Baryshekov's walking

01:10:20.060 --> 01:10:22.020
through Lincoln Center, and there's a lady

01:10:22.020 --> 01:10:22.620
holding a baby.

01:10:22.620 --> 01:10:23.220
That was me.

01:10:23.220 --> 01:10:23.980
Rubles.

01:10:23.980 --> 01:10:24.460
Yeah.

01:10:24.460 --> 01:10:26.700
Rubles, delicious rubles.

01:10:26.700 --> 01:10:27.500
Yeah.

01:10:27.500 --> 01:10:28.420
Netflix, it guys.

01:10:28.420 --> 01:10:29.100
It's a great flick.

01:10:29.100 --> 01:10:29.860
For one guy that knows that.

01:10:29.860 --> 01:10:30.980
Gregory Hines, fucking.

01:10:30.980 --> 01:10:33.140
And Leapers for your friend on your list.

01:10:33.140 --> 01:10:33.860
Can you tap his?

01:10:33.860 --> 01:10:34.740
Jumpers?

01:10:34.740 --> 01:10:35.300
Yeah, I can.

01:10:35.300 --> 01:10:36.020
I don't want to do it here.

01:10:36.020 --> 01:10:36.340
What?

01:10:36.340 --> 01:10:37.260
OK, I will.

01:10:37.260 --> 01:10:38.660
All right.

01:10:38.660 --> 01:10:40.140
Now, show me one tap step.

01:10:40.140 --> 01:10:40.900
You know one tap step.

01:10:40.900 --> 01:10:43.340
I don't know any tap steps, but if you gave me tap shoes,

01:10:43.340 --> 01:10:44.420
I bet I'd crush it.

01:10:44.420 --> 01:10:46.060
For real?

01:10:46.060 --> 01:10:46.940
I don't feel like I need.

01:10:46.940 --> 01:10:50.700
I feel like tap dancing is a dance that's just in my blood.

01:10:50.700 --> 01:10:54.220
I feel like Italians and Jews have always nominated tap.

01:10:54.220 --> 01:10:55.980
Tap has been our fucking old craft.

01:10:55.980 --> 01:10:58.060
I can't think of the times I've gone to a Italian restaurant

01:10:58.060 --> 01:11:00.980
where there wasn't an Italian guy tap dancing.

01:11:00.980 --> 01:11:02.940
Just some Italian guy with an accordion.

01:11:02.940 --> 01:11:04.940
Just fucking.

01:11:04.940 --> 01:11:07.420
Oh.

01:11:07.420 --> 01:11:08.260
Who's got time for this?

01:11:08.260 --> 01:11:10.380
That's the most important thing.

01:11:10.380 --> 01:11:11.540
It's all about the hands.

01:11:11.540 --> 01:11:13.180
Because a lot of people think it's about the feet.

01:11:13.180 --> 01:11:14.580
It's not.

01:11:14.580 --> 01:11:16.860
The feet are just tapping the fucking arms.

01:11:16.860 --> 01:11:18.180
That's where the magic happens.

01:11:18.180 --> 01:11:20.220
Who is your favorite Italian tap dancer?

01:11:20.220 --> 01:11:23.980
Oh, it's got to be Giovanni Pocciangi.

01:11:23.980 --> 01:11:26.660
I mean, whose feet move like Pocciangi?

01:11:26.660 --> 01:11:29.420
They called him Old Stonefoot, which

01:11:29.420 --> 01:11:32.060
was his horrible name because he had fucking the wonderful feet.

01:11:32.060 --> 01:11:35.980
Well, but they were referring to the strength of the tap.

01:11:35.980 --> 01:11:37.380
It wasn't about weight for him.

01:11:37.380 --> 01:11:40.700
It was like, wow, every step he takes is like,

01:11:40.700 --> 01:11:44.020
permanent and heavy.

01:11:44.020 --> 01:11:44.700
That's true.

01:11:44.700 --> 01:11:46.580
They used to say in Italian, it sounds beautiful.

01:11:46.580 --> 01:11:48.220
They said, pranccianni moriocchiata,

01:11:48.220 --> 01:11:50.380
which means you know he tapped there.

01:11:50.380 --> 01:11:51.860
That's what that means.

01:11:51.860 --> 01:11:55.220
There's a little fucking dent in the piazza.

01:11:55.220 --> 01:11:59.780
Every piazza in Southern Napoli has a little dent in it.

01:11:59.780 --> 01:12:05.500
There's an urban legend about Giovanni Pocciangi,

01:12:05.500 --> 01:12:10.860
about Giobini, that he, I mean, it is true that he.

01:12:10.860 --> 01:12:11.260
I see.

01:12:11.260 --> 01:12:12.460
I know you're going to say it.

01:12:12.460 --> 01:12:14.740
I think this is absolutely apocryphal, but go on.

01:12:14.740 --> 01:12:19.260
Well, but it is true that he was at the Yalta Conference.

01:12:19.260 --> 01:12:21.860
He's right behind Stone.

01:12:21.860 --> 01:12:23.900
Well, he was there as a performer,

01:12:23.900 --> 01:12:26.900
but the urban legend, because I don't actually

01:12:26.900 --> 01:12:30.620
believe this is possible, but that he did a dance for them.

01:12:30.620 --> 01:12:32.740
And at the end of every Italian tap dance,

01:12:32.740 --> 01:12:34.860
if you do it the Italian way, there's always,

01:12:34.860 --> 01:12:37.820
it's called the cabrese, the final tap.

01:12:37.820 --> 01:12:41.020
No, cabrese is like a salad with tomatoes and mozzarella.

01:12:41.020 --> 01:12:42.780
It's called the cabrazio.

01:12:42.780 --> 01:12:46.180
Cabrazio is the fun.

01:12:46.180 --> 01:12:46.940
I love a cabrese.

01:12:46.940 --> 01:12:54.140
It's ciubacci cabrese, which is the tap to end the tap.

01:12:54.140 --> 01:12:55.700
Or the tap of all taps.

01:12:55.700 --> 01:12:56.220
Right.

01:12:56.220 --> 01:12:57.140
So he went cabra.

01:12:57.140 --> 01:13:00.380
He did tap of the tutti-tapi.

01:13:00.380 --> 01:13:03.860
The urban legend is that his was so hard

01:13:03.860 --> 01:13:07.700
that it vibrated Stalin.

01:13:07.700 --> 01:13:10.180
It turned him into a Democrat.

01:13:10.180 --> 01:13:11.060
That's true.

01:13:11.060 --> 01:13:12.100
For 10 minutes.

01:13:12.100 --> 01:13:12.740
That's true.

01:13:12.740 --> 01:13:15.860
But then he forgot all of Marx's teachings.

01:13:15.860 --> 01:13:19.180
He went right back and broke the agreement on Poland

01:13:19.180 --> 01:13:20.620
and went right back into it.

01:13:20.620 --> 01:13:21.780
For 10 minutes, though.

01:13:21.780 --> 01:13:24.300
I mean, that's longer than any of us can tap someone's

01:13:24.300 --> 01:13:25.740
political views out of their heart.

01:13:25.740 --> 01:13:26.260
Yeah.

01:13:26.260 --> 01:13:29.060
And this is going to seem like a really bad pun.

01:13:29.060 --> 01:13:30.820
But this is just a historical fact.

01:13:30.820 --> 01:13:31.300
Give it to me.

01:13:31.300 --> 01:13:32.260
Not a little bit of time.

01:13:32.260 --> 01:13:34.060
That lag, that 10 minutes of lag,

01:13:34.060 --> 01:13:36.540
is where they came up with the term gulag.

01:13:36.540 --> 01:13:38.700
That's when people go to the gulag.

01:13:38.700 --> 01:13:39.220
Oh, boy.

01:13:39.220 --> 01:13:42.060
I told you it was going to seem like a bad pun.

01:13:42.060 --> 01:13:42.660
But it's not.

01:13:42.660 --> 01:13:44.260
That's just a historical fact.

01:13:44.260 --> 01:13:45.020
Are you Stalin?

01:13:45.020 --> 01:13:46.020
Are you Stalin for time?

01:13:46.020 --> 01:13:47.220
I watch a history channel.

01:13:47.220 --> 01:13:48.580
Stalin for time, everybody.

01:13:48.580 --> 01:13:50.340
Yes, I am Stalin for time.

01:13:50.340 --> 01:13:51.300
Gulag.

01:13:51.300 --> 01:13:55.340
I'm Hitler and then with my greatest Hitlers.

01:13:55.340 --> 01:13:57.660
These are my greatest Hitlers.

01:13:57.660 --> 01:13:59.900
You kicked me in my soul, Genetian.

01:13:59.900 --> 01:14:01.300
Not a fact, not even a thing.

01:14:01.300 --> 01:14:02.180
Very nice.

01:14:02.180 --> 01:14:03.060
Now we're doing it.

01:14:03.060 --> 01:14:05.820
I really, I really, I don't, I don't.

01:14:05.820 --> 01:14:06.300
So many.

01:14:06.300 --> 01:14:06.860
Falklands.

01:14:06.860 --> 01:14:08.500
So many of.

01:14:08.500 --> 01:14:11.300
Just trying to name some shit.

01:14:11.300 --> 01:14:13.860
Many, many, many, many.

01:14:13.860 --> 01:14:16.580
More than fucking Rhineland.

01:14:16.580 --> 01:14:18.940
Where the whole war started over fucking Rhineland, guys.

01:14:18.940 --> 01:14:21.340
What is your stance over the Falklands?

01:14:21.340 --> 01:14:21.900
You know what?

01:14:21.900 --> 01:14:23.220
Fucking take them and leave them.

01:14:23.220 --> 01:14:25.020
I'm going to give a shit.

01:14:25.020 --> 01:14:28.820
You guys, you know me.

01:14:28.820 --> 01:14:30.300
With the Falklands, I give a fuck.

01:14:30.300 --> 01:14:31.540
You know what I mean?

01:14:31.540 --> 01:14:32.380
That was a Jewish time.

01:14:32.380 --> 01:14:33.140
Maybe it's the absence.

01:14:33.140 --> 01:14:34.100
That was a Jewish mom talking.

01:14:34.100 --> 01:14:35.380
Maybe it's the absence of talking.

01:14:35.380 --> 01:14:36.100
Falkland too.

01:14:36.100 --> 01:14:37.500
Who needs, who needs to worry?

01:14:37.500 --> 01:14:38.980
Yeah, you got to worry.

01:14:38.980 --> 01:14:40.940
Call me when it's one Falkland, like a republic.

01:14:40.940 --> 01:14:42.020
How many nights?

01:14:42.020 --> 01:14:43.140
The Falkland Republic.

01:14:43.140 --> 01:14:44.220
Those are fucking Falklands.

01:14:44.220 --> 01:14:44.940
It's like, what is it?

01:14:44.940 --> 01:14:47.980
Like, like, like, like, pick one and get your shit together.

01:14:47.980 --> 01:14:50.540
And then we'll invade you instead of the fucking British.

01:14:50.540 --> 01:14:53.500
By the way, 15 years ago, there was a great Peter Fawkes

01:14:53.500 --> 01:14:54.100
joke to be made.

01:14:54.100 --> 01:14:55.860
But with this crowd, it'll never go.

01:14:55.860 --> 01:14:56.700
No, never.

01:14:56.700 --> 01:14:59.180
Pretend it's 1982.

01:14:59.180 --> 01:15:01.140
And give us your Peter Fawkes joke.

01:15:01.140 --> 01:15:02.540
Give us your Peter Fawkes joke.

01:15:02.540 --> 01:15:05.060
Have you guys ever take UCB 1982?

01:15:05.060 --> 01:15:06.380
You ever take that guy's fucking?

01:15:06.380 --> 01:15:07.180
It gets you really high.

01:15:07.180 --> 01:15:09.900
It's a really good class.

01:15:09.900 --> 01:15:13.820
Yeah, that's my Harold group.

01:15:13.820 --> 01:15:17.300
Peter, they get really mad when you fuck with the UCB, man.

01:15:17.300 --> 01:15:19.380
They're like, yo, bro, East Side fucking shit.

01:15:19.380 --> 01:15:20.300
Well, we're in there.

01:15:20.300 --> 01:15:22.180
It's like, oh, they were taking a shit on there.

01:15:22.180 --> 01:15:24.980
UCB, you know what I mean?

01:15:24.980 --> 01:15:26.820
It's like, you couldn't get it across town.

01:15:26.820 --> 01:15:27.340
You come here.

01:15:27.340 --> 01:15:27.840
I get it.

01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:29.740
Don't worry about it.

01:15:29.740 --> 01:15:30.540
I take my agrar.

01:15:30.540 --> 01:15:32.500
I get it.

01:15:32.500 --> 01:15:34.100
I can't get a C. Alice prescription.

01:15:34.100 --> 01:15:34.780
You get you understand.

01:15:34.780 --> 01:15:36.780
You guys know what I'm talking about.

01:15:36.780 --> 01:15:42.140
There's a lot of a lot of my fan.

01:15:42.140 --> 01:15:43.900
I don't like saying my fans because it feels.

01:15:43.900 --> 01:15:45.380
But I don't want to talk about that.

01:15:45.380 --> 01:15:47.460
But I don't know how to quickly say it.

01:15:47.460 --> 01:15:50.060
Well, a lot of my fans seem to be punsters.

01:15:50.060 --> 01:15:50.860
Like they like puns.

01:15:50.860 --> 01:15:53.020
And I find it very, very uncomfortable.

01:15:53.020 --> 01:15:54.020
Really?

01:15:54.020 --> 01:15:55.940
That's the best group of fans to have.

01:15:55.940 --> 01:15:58.300
People who understand horrible things.

01:15:58.300 --> 01:16:00.740
No, because in other words, you know in a comedy writer's room,

01:16:00.740 --> 01:16:04.380
and this is a weird thing, is like in a comedy writer's room,

01:16:04.380 --> 01:16:07.020
sometimes the worst version of a joke

01:16:07.020 --> 01:16:08.300
is the funniest thing in the room.

01:16:08.300 --> 01:16:09.300
Do you know what I'm talking about?

01:16:09.300 --> 01:16:10.820
Well, I mean, you go to that place.

01:16:10.820 --> 01:16:12.100
You would never put it on the show.

01:16:12.100 --> 01:16:13.620
Yeah, but never a well.

01:16:13.620 --> 01:16:15.140
I mean, you must be suggestive.

01:16:15.140 --> 01:16:17.100
I feel like you have a daily show story

01:16:17.100 --> 01:16:18.820
about how a pun I could think of.

01:16:18.820 --> 01:16:21.580
But there's loads of puns on that show.

01:16:21.580 --> 01:16:23.220
Well, you guys always connected everything

01:16:23.220 --> 01:16:25.460
of the mortis or whatever you call it over John Shoulder.

01:16:25.460 --> 01:16:27.380
Yeah, but those are technically puns.

01:16:27.380 --> 01:16:28.420
Yeah, and they're good.

01:16:28.420 --> 01:16:29.180
It's wordplay.

01:16:29.180 --> 01:16:31.540
We used to do the Ted Kazarinsky thing.

01:16:31.540 --> 01:16:33.100
You know what I'm talking about?

01:16:33.100 --> 01:16:34.380
Tim Kazarinsky, remember?

01:16:34.380 --> 01:16:36.340
The Rintin Tinfluenza.

01:16:36.340 --> 01:16:40.060
Keep on knocking, but you can't come in, fluenza.

01:16:40.060 --> 01:16:42.780
I mean, once that shit opened up,

01:16:42.780 --> 01:16:46.580
so there was a guy in Saturday Night Live who was a writer.

01:16:46.580 --> 01:16:47.140
Google him.

01:16:47.140 --> 01:16:48.420
The same as Kazarinsky.

01:16:48.420 --> 01:16:49.180
It's Tim, right?

01:16:49.180 --> 01:16:49.660
Yeah.

01:16:49.660 --> 01:16:50.180
OK.

01:16:50.180 --> 01:16:51.380
He was on the cast for a while.

01:16:51.380 --> 01:16:52.340
Yeah, he was on the cast.

01:16:52.340 --> 01:16:53.580
T-Cast.

01:16:53.580 --> 01:16:54.620
T-Cast, we call him.

01:16:54.620 --> 01:16:56.380
But wasn't it the Dick Ebersol years?

01:16:56.380 --> 01:16:57.180
The Dick Ebersol years?

01:16:57.180 --> 01:16:58.180
I think it might have been.

01:16:58.180 --> 01:16:59.500
Yeah, with, yeah.

01:16:59.500 --> 01:17:01.860
He was in school like a second city guy,

01:17:01.860 --> 01:17:03.460
way back in a very good cast.

01:17:03.460 --> 01:17:06.980
So try to explain that, because once you open that wormhole

01:17:06.980 --> 01:17:08.620
of bad jokery, you will.

01:17:08.620 --> 01:17:10.780
And it's great jokery in the beginning,

01:17:10.780 --> 01:17:11.780
and then it just takes.

01:17:11.780 --> 01:17:12.620
But there's a point.

01:17:12.620 --> 01:17:15.260
The influential one is, I remember being a little kid.

01:17:15.260 --> 01:17:16.860
I was a kid during the Ebersol years.

01:17:16.860 --> 01:17:18.740
There was Martin Short also, Ebersol.

01:17:18.740 --> 01:17:19.820
Yeah, and I think.

01:17:19.820 --> 01:17:24.660
What's his face from all the 16 Canon movies and shit?

01:17:24.660 --> 01:17:25.220
What's his name?

01:17:25.220 --> 01:17:27.020
Oh, Anthony Michael Hall.

01:17:27.020 --> 01:17:27.940
Anthony Michael Hall.

01:17:27.940 --> 01:17:29.260
Very good.

01:17:29.260 --> 01:17:32.300
And Elaine and Robert Downey Jr.

01:17:32.300 --> 01:17:33.260
Elaine from Seinfeld.

01:17:33.260 --> 01:17:33.900
Brad Hall.

01:17:33.900 --> 01:17:34.700
Gary Kroger.

01:17:34.700 --> 01:17:37.100
Who can forget the K-Rogue?

01:17:37.100 --> 01:17:38.340
No, Rich Hall.

01:17:38.340 --> 01:17:38.740
Rich Hall.

01:17:38.740 --> 01:17:39.420
Sniglets.

01:17:39.420 --> 01:17:41.180
But the weird thing is that I actually

01:17:41.180 --> 01:17:43.300
learned comedy from that season, because that

01:17:43.300 --> 01:17:45.540
was when I was sort of going through comedy puberty,

01:17:45.540 --> 01:17:47.300
in that it was like, all of a sudden,

01:17:47.300 --> 01:17:49.820
I was combined comedy and puberty in one word.

01:17:52.820 --> 01:17:53.300
Cuberty.

01:17:53.300 --> 01:17:55.420
Throw it to a room, and to take the terrible one,

01:17:55.420 --> 01:17:57.220
and then that's your process.

01:17:57.220 --> 01:17:57.980
That's a Rinsky.

01:18:01.180 --> 01:18:03.380
Everybody goes like, oh, that was terrible,

01:18:03.380 --> 01:18:06.180
but it's like, did you ever hear this about SNL that they go,

01:18:06.180 --> 01:18:07.780
everybody thinks that SNL was perfect.

01:18:07.780 --> 01:18:09.260
The year they were 10, and everybody

01:18:09.260 --> 01:18:11.140
thinks that it's currently in some kind of slump.

01:18:11.140 --> 01:18:11.860
Yes, always.

01:18:11.860 --> 01:18:14.060
Except if it 10-year-old came up right now, they'd be like,

01:18:14.060 --> 01:18:16.020
did you see fucking the thing I was saying?

01:18:16.020 --> 01:18:17.900
And they'd be right, because it's all 12.

01:18:17.900 --> 01:18:18.660
I always say 12.

01:18:18.660 --> 01:18:20.300
Yeah, 12, you're like sixth grade.

01:18:20.300 --> 01:18:21.100
That's like 12, right?

01:18:21.100 --> 01:18:23.220
Six to eighth grade, it's the fucking best show ever.

01:18:23.220 --> 01:18:25.220
When did your ass get rock hard?

01:18:25.220 --> 01:18:25.620
Mine?

01:18:25.620 --> 01:18:26.540
Is that 12?

01:18:26.540 --> 01:18:27.020
Mine?

01:18:27.020 --> 01:18:28.620
I'm still waiting on that.

01:18:28.620 --> 01:18:30.340
Because I remember that's what it was.

01:18:30.340 --> 01:18:32.780
I was watching Ed Grimly, and he was going, I must say,

01:18:32.780 --> 01:18:35.060
and I was like, whoa, my ass is really hard,

01:18:35.060 --> 01:18:36.260
and that's really funny.

01:18:36.260 --> 01:18:37.580
Why was your ass rock hard?

01:18:37.580 --> 01:18:40.100
I was like, non-sequitur, kind of weird pedophile joke.

01:18:40.100 --> 01:18:45.740
I have a mnemonic device for how to remember a 12-year-old.

01:18:45.740 --> 01:18:47.660
I don't think there's anything weird about talking

01:18:47.660 --> 01:18:49.660
about 12-year-old asses, OK?

01:18:49.660 --> 01:18:52.340
Maybe I'm in the fucking minority here.

01:18:52.340 --> 01:18:54.580
Trying to get your back here, bro.

01:18:54.580 --> 01:18:56.460
I don't know how to get out of this one.

01:18:56.460 --> 01:18:57.580
But that's all I did.

01:18:57.580 --> 01:18:58.940
I mean, you're a couple of years younger than me.

01:18:58.940 --> 01:19:00.900
What do you think about the bit where I whispered with the mic

01:19:00.900 --> 01:19:01.580
to my mouth?

01:19:01.580 --> 01:19:02.540
Does that work?

01:19:02.540 --> 01:19:02.940
I don't know.

01:19:02.940 --> 01:19:03.700
I do that all the time.

01:19:03.700 --> 01:19:06.300
Because I feel like that's negating the whole point

01:19:06.300 --> 01:19:07.100
of the whisper.

01:19:07.100 --> 01:19:08.340
Don't ask for my input.

01:19:08.340 --> 01:19:09.820
You're fucking.

01:19:09.820 --> 01:19:11.660
Why is he not the host?

01:19:11.660 --> 01:19:12.980
He's already a better host.

01:19:12.980 --> 01:19:13.980
He should host Harmontown.

01:19:13.980 --> 01:19:16.020
It's just not appropriate, because it's good.

01:19:16.020 --> 01:19:18.220
Anyway, explain the show.

01:19:18.220 --> 01:19:19.900
There's a time machine involved.

01:19:19.900 --> 01:19:22.940
Dan's got fucking spent all of his hard earned money.

01:19:22.940 --> 01:19:24.540
Oh, this is the premise of the show, actually.

01:19:24.540 --> 01:19:25.460
He spent all of it.

01:19:25.460 --> 01:19:28.260
He spent all of his hard earned money inventing a time machine.

01:19:28.260 --> 01:19:29.060
And you go, wow.

01:19:29.060 --> 01:19:30.660
So we can solve the world's problems?

01:19:30.660 --> 01:19:31.460
Nope.

01:19:31.460 --> 01:19:34.300
So we can host a talk show with people from history.

01:19:34.300 --> 01:19:36.460
And then solve the world's problems, hopefully,

01:19:36.460 --> 01:19:37.020
by getting.

01:19:37.020 --> 01:19:38.540
By talking to people from history.

01:19:38.540 --> 01:19:39.780
But he could go back in time.

01:19:39.780 --> 01:19:40.420
So can we talk?

01:19:40.420 --> 01:19:41.940
Hey, Rich, can you hear me?

01:19:41.940 --> 01:19:43.260
What if he can't?

01:19:43.260 --> 01:19:44.660
This is a terrible, terrible theater.

01:19:44.660 --> 01:19:45.180
Terrible.

01:19:45.180 --> 01:19:45.860
Sounds to.

01:19:45.860 --> 01:19:46.660
But he might not be here.

01:19:46.660 --> 01:19:49.540
But Rich, can you answer me one question?

01:19:49.540 --> 01:19:51.500
Rich Corson is the executive producer, everybody.

01:19:51.500 --> 01:19:53.100
So is it?

01:19:53.100 --> 01:19:56.340
And also, former Daily Show producer,

01:19:56.340 --> 01:19:57.900
he's sort of like, Ron Comisani.

01:19:57.900 --> 01:19:59.700
Rich Corson, you should clap for him.

01:19:59.700 --> 01:20:01.100
Rich, ladies, if you'd like.

01:20:01.100 --> 01:20:02.740
You said it was OK to talk about the show.

01:20:02.740 --> 01:20:05.580
Is it OK to tell him who the cast is?

01:20:05.580 --> 01:20:06.180
OK.

01:20:06.180 --> 01:20:09.380
So like, Robert Smigel is playing Albert Einstein.

01:20:09.380 --> 01:20:14.180
And Rory is playing Benjamin Franklin.

01:20:14.180 --> 01:20:17.060
And nice, dude.

01:20:17.060 --> 01:20:19.100
Fucking perfect use of the fart noise.

01:20:19.100 --> 01:20:22.300
Somebody took UCB level four fart noise.

01:20:22.300 --> 01:20:25.260
That guy's seven grand into his first work show.

01:20:25.260 --> 01:20:28.020
His parents are on the back, they're like, worth every penny,

01:20:28.020 --> 01:20:31.020
Jared.

01:20:31.020 --> 01:20:32.460
Totally worth it.

01:20:32.460 --> 01:20:35.820
Four classes a kid now had fart noise.

01:20:35.820 --> 01:20:39.300
He has a green belt in fart prof.

01:20:39.300 --> 01:20:41.660
He's not an OT yet.

01:20:41.660 --> 01:20:42.620
Just keep spending.

01:20:42.620 --> 01:20:44.860
At some point, you'll be in a movie.

01:20:44.860 --> 01:20:47.620
At the end of the level five workshop,

01:20:47.620 --> 01:20:49.860
they take you to a room where Matt Besser has written

01:20:49.860 --> 01:20:54.220
in a notebook that Improv was created by horses.

01:20:54.220 --> 01:20:58.580
He's referencing Scientology, assholes.

01:20:58.580 --> 01:21:01.100
He's spending it in a system that won't help you.

01:21:01.100 --> 01:21:02.500
Get out while you can.

01:21:02.500 --> 01:21:06.420
Seriously, though, folks, how about fucking Scientology?

01:21:06.420 --> 01:21:07.660
Seriously.

01:21:07.660 --> 01:21:09.980
I don't want to be unentertainingly sycophantic,

01:21:09.980 --> 01:21:13.700
but I do feel like I want to add a footnote that I don't.

01:21:13.700 --> 01:21:16.140
I'm very happy that UCB had us here.

01:21:16.140 --> 01:21:18.260
And I do their shows all the time.

01:21:18.260 --> 01:21:20.820
I have a great time with their wonderful people.

01:21:20.820 --> 01:21:22.100
I want to add a footnote that says,

01:21:22.100 --> 01:21:23.300
the landscape of Los Angeles.

01:21:23.300 --> 01:21:26.700
Angela Poller is Elron Hubbard.

01:21:26.700 --> 01:21:29.220
So we have two different views on this.

01:21:29.220 --> 01:21:31.220
Two different views.

01:21:31.220 --> 01:21:34.740
If Poller believes aliens created Improv.

01:21:34.740 --> 01:21:38.060
Better Elron Hubbard than UNICEF, right?

01:21:38.060 --> 01:21:39.900
Xeon, what's his name?

01:21:39.900 --> 01:21:41.900
Xenu.

01:21:41.900 --> 01:21:43.740
Have you guys been to the Xenu Marathon?

01:21:43.740 --> 01:21:46.820
The Xenu Improv Marathon?

01:21:46.820 --> 01:21:50.140
It's 24 hours of Xenu Improv.

01:21:50.140 --> 01:21:51.060
You can't don't miss it.

01:21:51.060 --> 01:21:54.660
Rob Riggle just fucking crushes it.

01:21:54.660 --> 01:21:56.820
They put a volcano on the cover of Dianetics.

01:21:56.820 --> 01:21:57.980
I was just looking at one.

01:21:57.980 --> 01:22:01.420
In LA, we have probably more billboards for shit than you do.

01:22:01.420 --> 01:22:04.980
In LA, people are like, that sounds good.

01:22:04.980 --> 01:22:07.860
In New York, it's like, get the fuck out of my way.

01:22:07.860 --> 01:22:10.860
Today, a lady tried to give me a thing.

01:22:10.860 --> 01:22:12.340
No one in LA walks.

01:22:12.340 --> 01:22:13.940
That's a fair observation.

01:22:13.940 --> 01:22:15.700
But in New York, when you walk down the street,

01:22:15.700 --> 01:22:17.740
people are always trying to hand you shit, right?

01:22:17.740 --> 01:22:19.540
How many people in here have ever been like, oh, yes.

01:22:19.540 --> 01:22:20.860
I'd like that.

01:22:20.860 --> 01:22:23.060
You're like, get the fuck out of my way.

01:22:23.060 --> 01:22:24.860
It always makes me think, again, an airplane,

01:22:24.860 --> 01:22:26.740
like when you just fucking snap people's necks.

01:22:26.740 --> 01:22:28.660
You know, the guy's walking in the airport and is like,

01:22:28.660 --> 01:22:30.740
all right, Chris, he's just fucking killing people.

01:22:30.740 --> 01:22:31.580
That's what I wanted to do.

01:22:31.580 --> 01:22:32.540
Like, do you know the dolphins?

01:22:32.540 --> 01:22:34.260
I'm like, crack, you know?

01:22:34.260 --> 01:22:35.420
And I like dolphins.

01:22:35.420 --> 01:22:37.020
I just want to kill that lady.

01:22:37.020 --> 01:22:37.860
You know what I mean?

01:22:37.860 --> 01:22:40.140
I will then go home and donate to the dolphin cause.

01:22:40.140 --> 01:22:41.300
I'm all for the cause.

01:22:41.300 --> 01:22:42.860
It's just her talking to me on the street.

01:22:42.860 --> 01:22:45.100
You wish there was a way to accidentally eat her

01:22:45.100 --> 01:22:45.900
with a sandwich.

01:22:45.900 --> 01:22:47.340
Yes, exactly.

01:22:47.340 --> 01:22:49.540
It's really her.

01:22:49.540 --> 01:22:51.580
Sometimes humans ruin it for the dolphins, I guess,

01:22:51.580 --> 01:22:52.620
is what I'm saying, guys.

01:22:52.620 --> 01:22:53.980
Well, that's, yeah, that's probably true.

01:22:53.980 --> 01:22:54.820
Have you?

01:22:54.820 --> 01:22:59.100
But in addition to loving puns and generally being atheists,

01:22:59.100 --> 01:23:01.740
my audience, who I love very much,

01:23:01.740 --> 01:23:04.660
What, you're really scared of losing them, huh?

01:23:04.660 --> 01:23:05.500
I love them.

01:23:05.500 --> 01:23:06.340
I love them.

01:23:06.340 --> 01:23:07.180
And I ate a lot of caviar.

01:23:07.180 --> 01:23:08.020
I made them dinner tonight.

01:23:08.020 --> 01:23:08.860
They're the best.

01:23:08.860 --> 01:23:09.700
They're young.

01:23:09.700 --> 01:23:10.540
They're cool.

01:23:10.540 --> 01:23:11.380
UCB is the greatest.

01:23:11.380 --> 01:23:12.220
However.

01:23:12.220 --> 01:23:13.060
However.

01:23:13.060 --> 01:23:14.860
Now you know the answer why he got the job.

01:23:14.860 --> 01:23:15.940
Cause he has like followers.

01:23:15.940 --> 01:23:17.100
And I keep being like, how about this?

01:23:17.100 --> 01:23:18.420
You guys are all fucking loose.

01:23:18.420 --> 01:23:22.220
And then they're like, you know what you're doing?

01:23:22.220 --> 01:23:23.340
You're alienating the crap.

01:23:23.340 --> 01:23:26.180
But they're fucking loose.

01:23:26.180 --> 01:23:29.060
You're not even connecting those dots.

01:23:29.060 --> 01:23:30.660
You're not developing a group of people

01:23:30.660 --> 01:23:31.740
who are interested in what you have to say.

01:23:31.740 --> 01:23:33.660
Cause they're all like.

01:23:33.660 --> 01:23:34.780
That might be an important thing

01:23:34.780 --> 01:23:35.860
to have been said to me.

01:23:35.860 --> 01:23:37.740
Like I didn't, I didn't connect this.

01:23:37.740 --> 01:23:38.580
I should try.

01:23:38.580 --> 01:23:39.780
I'm obsessed with like not,

01:23:39.780 --> 01:23:43.540
I think cause I like, I have a terrible, terrible like fear

01:23:43.540 --> 01:23:46.740
of like that at any minute, everyone's gonna go like,

01:23:46.740 --> 01:23:47.580
you're.

01:23:47.580 --> 01:23:48.420
No, you're in.

01:23:48.420 --> 01:23:49.260
You're out.

01:23:49.260 --> 01:23:51.940
And it doesn't, but it's not a logic-based thing.

01:23:51.940 --> 01:23:53.380
So it's like, it's an emotional thing.

01:23:53.380 --> 01:23:55.460
So like, you know, the reason gay people don't like being

01:23:55.460 --> 01:23:58.180
called fags is not because they're like, am I, am I a bad?

01:23:58.180 --> 01:24:00.740
How do we get, how do we get to here?

01:24:00.740 --> 01:24:01.860
I feel like we were all with you.

01:24:01.860 --> 01:24:03.820
And then you're like, that's why fags are fags.

01:24:03.820 --> 01:24:05.980
It's like, wait, what?

01:24:05.980 --> 01:24:06.980
I think you misheard me.

01:24:06.980 --> 01:24:09.420
You're like, that's why the Jews fucking run the economy.

01:24:09.420 --> 01:24:11.220
You know, I was like, wow, hold on.

01:24:11.220 --> 01:24:13.180
That's, that's how they all do it, Dan.

01:24:13.180 --> 01:24:14.020
That's how they run.

01:24:14.020 --> 01:24:17.220
We have latent like, like, like memories of like the first

01:24:17.220 --> 01:24:19.700
time we were ever genuinely terrified that it was possible

01:24:19.700 --> 01:24:23.420
to be excommunicated basically from the, from the monkey tree

01:24:23.420 --> 01:24:27.180
and lose our figs and lose our ability to, to, to be.

01:24:27.180 --> 01:24:30.980
We would start fires like primates die on their own to 1835.

01:24:30.980 --> 01:24:32.940
You just wanted all the fires started.

01:24:32.940 --> 01:24:34.500
We never, we never got, but you are right.

01:24:34.500 --> 01:24:37.420
It's like a little, it's like, yeah, it's an obsession with me.

01:24:37.420 --> 01:24:39.700
Like it's, it's, it's like, like I really always want to like,

01:24:39.700 --> 01:24:42.940
I want to, I want to endure myself and it's a little wasted

01:24:42.940 --> 01:24:44.780
sometimes because like, look at me.

01:24:44.780 --> 01:24:47.020
I look like somebody that hates everybody.

01:24:47.020 --> 01:24:47.940
But that's why you're charming.

01:24:47.940 --> 01:24:49.740
I probably do hate everybody.

01:24:49.740 --> 01:24:51.580
Can I give us, can we give you a minute just for Dan?

01:24:51.580 --> 01:24:54.780
Stop sticking up for me because that makes me up for Dan.

01:24:54.780 --> 01:24:56.380
I want to stick up for Dan.

01:24:56.380 --> 01:24:59.940
Dan is the fucking definition of the fucking dude.

01:24:59.940 --> 01:25:01.620
You're all, you're like the guy,

01:25:01.620 --> 01:25:05.780
and here's the joke about it though, Dan is the fucking definition

01:25:05.780 --> 01:25:06.780
of a fucking dude.

01:25:06.780 --> 01:25:07.620
Yeah.

01:25:07.620 --> 01:25:08.900
You know what the dude is.

01:25:08.900 --> 01:25:11.620
You've seen, you know, the dude, he's the dude.

01:25:11.620 --> 01:25:14.980
And it's like the thing where like, he doesn't know he's cool,

01:25:14.980 --> 01:25:17.540
which is why we're all like, you're fucking cool.

01:25:17.540 --> 01:25:18.380
You know what I mean?

01:25:18.380 --> 01:25:19.820
And then like, if the minute you're like, yeah,

01:25:19.820 --> 01:25:21.540
you know what everything I do say makes sense.

01:25:21.540 --> 01:25:23.180
People are like, you're a dick.

01:25:23.180 --> 01:25:24.020
You know what I mean?

01:25:24.020 --> 01:25:24.860
You're bad at it.

01:25:24.860 --> 01:25:25.700
You're not fooling me.

01:25:25.700 --> 01:25:27.220
I know I'm going to step off stage and be like, wait,

01:25:27.220 --> 01:25:28.700
what did he say?

01:25:28.700 --> 01:25:29.780
No, I haven't listened at all.

01:25:29.780 --> 01:25:32.300
He just said, I was, I mean, then I was a thing.

01:25:32.300 --> 01:25:34.580
You said you may or may not hate people.

01:25:34.580 --> 01:25:35.420
I do.

01:25:35.420 --> 01:25:36.780
Yeah, I do.

01:25:36.780 --> 01:25:39.900
I hate, I hate all of them.

01:25:39.900 --> 01:25:40.740
Yeah.

01:25:40.740 --> 01:25:44.140
I mean, well, I mean, it's like money changes that a lot

01:25:44.140 --> 01:25:45.740
because it's like, it turns into.

01:25:45.740 --> 01:25:47.860
How much money you get from a sitcom?

01:25:47.860 --> 01:25:49.620
Let me just say this late night fucking,

01:25:49.620 --> 01:25:51.340
I wear the same pants a lot.

01:25:51.340 --> 01:25:52.180
You know what I mean?

01:25:52.180 --> 01:25:54.540
Well, did you, I mean, did you grew up poor, right?

01:25:54.540 --> 01:25:55.380
I mean, you see.

01:25:55.380 --> 01:25:56.220
I grew up middle class.

01:25:56.220 --> 01:25:57.980
Yeah, I mean, like lower middle class.

01:25:57.980 --> 01:26:00.300
I'm telling you, if I farted like that,

01:26:00.300 --> 01:26:02.980
my dad wouldn't have been like, I'm proud of you.

01:26:02.980 --> 01:26:05.220
Get a fucking job.

01:26:05.220 --> 01:26:06.060
Yeah.

01:26:06.060 --> 01:26:08.940
You make more than washing a million dishes.

01:26:08.940 --> 01:26:11.020
Yeah, I just mean, when you create a sitcom,

01:26:11.020 --> 01:26:13.180
like did you come here and like the Dan Hormann Express,

01:26:13.180 --> 01:26:14.300
like some fucking thing?

01:26:14.300 --> 01:26:16.660
No, but I like zipline, do you zipline places?

01:26:16.660 --> 01:26:17.500
I guess is what I mean.

01:26:17.500 --> 01:26:18.340
I don't.

01:26:18.340 --> 01:26:20.140
I never do a place where I can zipline anywhere.

01:26:20.140 --> 01:26:21.620
I haven't gotten to the zipline phase yet.

01:26:21.620 --> 01:26:22.620
You haven't.

01:26:22.620 --> 01:26:25.340
Because, you know, like Chuck Lorre, who created the two and a half men,

01:26:25.340 --> 01:26:28.020
he ziplines all across America.

01:26:28.020 --> 01:26:28.900
That's his true story.

01:26:28.900 --> 01:26:30.060
No, he could he fly?

01:26:30.060 --> 01:26:31.060
He seems so inconvenient.

01:26:31.060 --> 01:26:31.820
Could he fly?

01:26:31.820 --> 01:26:32.420
Yes.

01:26:32.420 --> 01:26:33.500
Does he choose zipline?

01:26:33.500 --> 01:26:34.220
Absolutely.

01:26:34.220 --> 01:26:36.660
He has a series of, he has a series of wires,

01:26:36.660 --> 01:26:37.820
and he just, series of wires.

01:26:37.820 --> 01:26:39.140
He leaves, he leaves Warner Brothers.

01:26:39.140 --> 01:26:40.620
Higher than the poor people can see.

01:26:40.620 --> 01:26:43.260
He leaves Warner Brothers.

01:26:43.260 --> 01:26:44.860
It's out of poor vision.

01:26:44.860 --> 01:26:46.660
Poor people can only see one mile.

01:26:46.660 --> 01:26:49.220
Because of malnutrition.

01:26:49.220 --> 01:26:51.660
Because you guys think you don't enjoy carrots.

01:26:51.660 --> 01:26:54.260
The food supply, guys, because of the food supply,

01:26:54.260 --> 01:26:56.500
you can only see one mile into the sky.

01:26:56.500 --> 01:26:58.700
Fucking Chuck Lorre, mile and a half up,

01:26:58.700 --> 01:27:00.420
get a whole city.

01:27:00.420 --> 01:27:03.100
It's like the Ewok Village, but it's just,

01:27:03.100 --> 01:27:05.660
it's just show creators up there, guys.

01:27:05.660 --> 01:27:08.700
The late night people, I once was invited to like a party

01:27:08.700 --> 01:27:12.020
at one house, but like, the fucking gods who create the shit,

01:27:12.020 --> 01:27:13.540
they're like fucking zipline all over.

01:27:13.540 --> 01:27:15.380
If you say, if Chuck Lorre comes over to your house,

01:27:15.380 --> 01:27:16.980
he said, you want to write home, he's like, no, I'm good.

01:27:16.980 --> 01:27:18.500
And he walks, he climbs the tree,

01:27:18.500 --> 01:27:20.540
throws his belt over, and the fucking thing.

01:27:20.540 --> 01:27:21.380
Yes.

01:27:21.380 --> 01:27:22.980
And it's like, here's what's weird.

01:27:22.980 --> 01:27:24.940
Why would he have to climb a tree?

01:27:24.940 --> 01:27:25.940
You know what I mean?

01:27:25.940 --> 01:27:27.900
Like, with that much money, but he prefers it.

01:27:27.900 --> 01:27:31.580
Because he feels like any pussy can get a fucking ride.

01:27:31.580 --> 01:27:32.900
You know what I mean to the zipline?

01:27:32.900 --> 01:27:35.140
What do you mean, how would you get up?

01:27:35.140 --> 01:27:37.100
I don't know, fucking zipline escalator.

01:27:37.100 --> 01:27:38.260
I don't know.

01:27:38.260 --> 01:27:40.660
That's why I don't have a fucking sitcom.

01:27:40.660 --> 01:27:41.860
You know what I mean?

01:27:41.860 --> 01:27:44.300
The late night world is just fucking

01:27:44.300 --> 01:27:46.060
a powered walkways like at the airport.

01:27:46.060 --> 01:27:50.180
Spencer, if you get a zipline from one location

01:27:50.180 --> 01:27:52.300
to another location, like it could be from your house

01:27:52.300 --> 01:27:53.620
to a certain restaurant, you're like,

01:27:53.620 --> 01:27:55.300
for one place to another, it could be anywhere

01:27:55.300 --> 01:27:56.140
across the planet.

01:27:56.140 --> 01:27:59.140
You can go from Dungeons to Dragons.

01:27:59.140 --> 01:28:01.740
That's the most distance you get anywhere.

01:28:01.740 --> 01:28:04.500
That's right.

01:28:04.500 --> 01:28:05.900
Where would you zipline from?

01:28:05.900 --> 01:28:08.740
And if you had one zipline that was always available to you.

01:28:08.740 --> 01:28:11.260
I definitely started in Baton Rouge.

01:28:14.100 --> 01:28:15.460
A fine choice.

01:28:15.460 --> 01:28:17.420
A fine choice.

01:28:17.420 --> 01:28:20.180
And then you got like a fucking basket full of crawfish.

01:28:20.180 --> 01:28:21.660
And you're like, I'm zipline.

01:28:21.660 --> 01:28:24.180
I'm zipline into Canada.

01:28:24.180 --> 01:28:25.180
OK.

01:28:25.180 --> 01:28:26.620
They'll appreciate this.

01:28:26.620 --> 01:28:32.780
Nobody will dispute your choice to start in Baton Rouge.

01:28:32.780 --> 01:28:34.180
Where is your destination?

01:28:34.180 --> 01:28:36.020
I was going to say Toronto.

01:28:39.020 --> 01:28:40.220
Of course.

01:28:40.220 --> 01:28:46.300
You can't get, you can bring jazz and crawfish to the north.

01:28:46.300 --> 01:28:47.660
And you won't get a zipline.

01:28:47.660 --> 01:28:48.660
Here I come.

01:28:48.660 --> 01:28:50.140
Hey, guys.

01:28:50.140 --> 01:28:52.740
And you eat crawdaddies just playing the trombone.

01:28:52.740 --> 01:28:54.940
Hey, guys, I got loads of crawdaddies.

01:28:54.940 --> 01:28:58.060
But I could also use some Greek food in Toronto.

01:28:58.060 --> 01:29:00.900
Everybody's so busy trying to be better than each other.

01:29:00.900 --> 01:29:02.700
No one's focused on where would I

01:29:02.700 --> 01:29:05.420
be really useful in a way that's attainable.

01:29:05.420 --> 01:29:08.540
Be the seafood king of Toronto.

01:29:08.540 --> 01:29:11.620
Be its primary supplier of shellfish.

01:29:11.620 --> 01:29:16.180
I also like the sub-economy of zipline wire transfer guys.

01:29:16.180 --> 01:29:17.540
We'll have to sit up at the zipline

01:29:17.540 --> 01:29:19.540
and be like, where are you headed, north?

01:29:19.540 --> 01:29:21.020
You know what I mean?

01:29:21.020 --> 01:29:22.540
I think they're like Chuck Lorre.

01:29:22.540 --> 01:29:23.820
They're like Chuck Lorre, you've got to wait.

01:29:23.820 --> 01:29:25.540
The guys who created Cheers are ahead of you.

01:29:25.540 --> 01:29:26.700
You know what I mean?

01:29:26.700 --> 01:29:28.060
They're on their way to Florida.

01:29:28.060 --> 01:29:29.260
Starting point destination.

01:29:29.260 --> 01:29:31.420
Where's your starting point destination?

01:29:31.420 --> 01:29:32.700
How far does zipline go?

01:29:32.700 --> 01:29:34.580
It could go all the way around the world if you'd like.

01:29:34.580 --> 01:29:35.380
The whole world.

01:29:35.380 --> 01:29:36.620
Yeah, not the moon.

01:29:36.620 --> 01:29:37.260
It should be.

01:29:37.260 --> 01:29:38.660
Well, the moon's not in the world.

01:29:38.660 --> 01:29:40.020
I don't want to be a dick.

01:29:40.020 --> 01:29:41.900
I'd say.

01:29:41.900 --> 01:29:42.460
I love that.

01:29:42.460 --> 01:29:45.380
Anywhere in America except the moon.

01:29:45.380 --> 01:29:48.820
I know we put a flag in it, but we don't own it.

01:29:48.820 --> 01:29:50.700
It could be just like a rock in there.

01:29:50.700 --> 01:29:51.660
It could be Istanbul.

01:29:51.660 --> 01:29:52.420
It could be Saigon.

01:29:52.420 --> 01:29:54.020
It could be Brisbane.

01:29:54.020 --> 01:29:55.460
It could be wherever you like.

01:29:55.460 --> 01:29:57.340
Wow, you just named places.

01:29:59.780 --> 01:30:01.780
I would say it's, I mean, I would start in New York

01:30:01.780 --> 01:30:02.980
just because that's where I live.

01:30:02.980 --> 01:30:05.220
And then I would go to.

01:30:05.220 --> 01:30:06.380
You only get one zipline.

01:30:06.380 --> 01:30:07.660
You could zip anywhere you want.

01:30:07.660 --> 01:30:09.980
And then I got to live there forever?

01:30:09.980 --> 01:30:11.940
No, you could zip back and forth.

01:30:11.940 --> 01:30:14.060
Oh, but I can't like zip to multiple locations.

01:30:14.060 --> 01:30:18.020
No, you get one, I think you get one zipline start.

01:30:18.020 --> 01:30:19.300
That's a really good question.

01:30:19.300 --> 01:30:22.300
Spencer very controversially picked Baton Rouge in Toronto.

01:30:25.300 --> 01:30:26.700
Very pragmatically.

01:30:26.700 --> 01:30:30.420
Yeah, by the way, the internet's fucking shit's trending right now.

01:30:30.420 --> 01:30:32.860
That's such a Reddit answer.

01:30:32.860 --> 01:30:35.100
It's like, I figured it out.

01:30:35.100 --> 01:30:38.780
This is the best way to use a zipline.

01:30:38.780 --> 01:30:45.380
I will have $8 million in three years, and then 900 guys

01:30:45.380 --> 01:30:47.300
questioning it, but then just watching.

01:30:47.300 --> 01:30:49.740
A top Reddit thread is just if the original poster is just

01:30:49.740 --> 01:30:52.540
like, chop, chop, chop, all the peer review.

01:30:52.540 --> 01:30:54.700
Well, actually, wasn't that, pshah, actually, pshah.

01:30:54.700 --> 01:30:57.420
No, fucking do your math.

01:30:57.420 --> 01:30:58.420
Do your math.

01:30:58.420 --> 01:31:00.300
I love the idea.

01:31:00.300 --> 01:31:02.060
I love the trend.

01:31:02.060 --> 01:31:03.100
It would have gone good there.

01:31:03.100 --> 01:31:05.260
I love the trend right now that it's just fucking like,

01:31:05.260 --> 01:31:07.300
it's like Toronto, Spencer, question mark,

01:31:07.300 --> 01:31:08.460
like you're in a boy band.

01:31:08.460 --> 01:31:09.620
You know what I mean?

01:31:09.620 --> 01:31:11.340
So, Rory, you start in New York.

01:31:11.340 --> 01:31:12.740
It's one direction.

01:31:12.740 --> 01:31:13.900
You're starting in New York.

01:31:13.900 --> 01:31:14.820
Starting in New York.

01:31:14.820 --> 01:31:16.260
You get to zip to one place.

01:31:16.260 --> 01:31:17.860
I would probably zip to like Brazil.

01:31:17.860 --> 01:31:19.380
Zip?

01:31:19.380 --> 01:31:20.660
That's a whole fucking country.

01:31:20.660 --> 01:31:22.260
I know, but where's the place where all those fucking

01:31:22.260 --> 01:31:23.300
titties are mouncin'?

01:31:23.300 --> 01:31:24.140
You know what I mean?

01:31:24.140 --> 01:31:25.220
That's all I know about Brazil.

01:31:25.220 --> 01:31:26.700
Our mountain?

01:31:26.700 --> 01:31:27.820
No, bouncy titties.

01:31:27.820 --> 01:31:33.060
The fact that you can't name a city in Brazil, man,

01:31:33.060 --> 01:31:34.260
you're not qualified to zip.

01:31:34.260 --> 01:31:36.980
Yeah, Rio de Jatiti.

01:31:36.980 --> 01:31:38.740
You want a zip line to Rio de Janeiro?

01:31:38.740 --> 01:31:41.260
I understand that Rio is such a fucked up place

01:31:41.260 --> 01:31:43.580
that rich people have to travel via air

01:31:43.580 --> 01:31:44.900
from building to building and shit.

01:31:44.900 --> 01:31:45.740
They can't go to the ground.

01:31:45.740 --> 01:31:46.580
It's called zip lines, man.

01:31:46.580 --> 01:31:49.260
So what I'm saying is I would fucking zip into Rio,

01:31:49.260 --> 01:31:52.620
fucking zip up some Rio titties, and then I'd zip out.

01:31:52.620 --> 01:31:54.300
No, because you have a zip line, too.

01:31:54.300 --> 01:31:54.860
I get it, guys.

01:31:54.860 --> 01:31:55.900
Pretty controversial.

01:31:55.900 --> 01:31:58.820
So human trafficking, you'd use your zip line.

01:31:58.820 --> 01:32:00.860
Hey, hey, you know what?

01:32:00.860 --> 01:32:03.340
How the ladies get there's not my problem.

01:32:03.340 --> 01:32:04.460
I just use zip lines.

01:32:04.460 --> 01:32:06.380
Money don't know where it came from, you understand?

01:32:06.380 --> 01:32:07.980
I have enough money for a zip line.

01:32:07.980 --> 01:32:09.980
You don't worry about the fucking route of the problem.

01:32:09.980 --> 01:32:12.820
I'm disturbed by the fact zip lines don't human traffic.

01:32:12.820 --> 01:32:16.060
Humans human traffic.

01:32:16.060 --> 01:32:17.420
Exactly.

01:32:17.420 --> 01:32:19.340
Guys, you don't make enough money to zip line

01:32:19.340 --> 01:32:21.020
to worry about your peasant problems.

01:32:21.020 --> 01:32:21.820
You know what I mean?

01:32:21.820 --> 01:32:25.100
Dan, zip lines start and destination.

01:32:25.100 --> 01:32:28.460
Well, start's tough because you guys are questioning.

01:32:28.460 --> 01:32:29.860
We're going to make Ali at Aliyah.

01:32:29.860 --> 01:32:31.580
You guys have picked two places.

01:32:31.580 --> 01:32:32.980
You could live in Los Angeles.

01:32:32.980 --> 01:32:33.980
You could live in New York.

01:32:33.980 --> 01:32:36.540
You could have a zip line between two other destinations

01:32:36.540 --> 01:32:40.060
that you have at your leisure to zip back and forth.

01:32:40.060 --> 01:32:41.220
Like, you just take off your belt,

01:32:41.220 --> 01:32:42.580
throw it over the wire, and it goes Zoom,

01:32:42.580 --> 01:32:43.580
and you're fucking.

01:32:43.580 --> 01:32:46.380
Can't there be a more comfortable way to go?

01:32:46.380 --> 01:32:47.380
I don't want to be a drag.

01:32:47.380 --> 01:32:48.940
Can't there be like a first class zip?

01:32:48.940 --> 01:32:49.980
I don't want to use my belt.

01:32:49.980 --> 01:32:51.500
I think you have a belt.

01:32:51.500 --> 01:32:53.340
You just, you just James Bond it.

01:32:53.340 --> 01:32:54.340
That's it?

01:32:54.340 --> 01:32:56.700
Because I just want to be, I don't want to be a dick,

01:32:56.700 --> 01:32:57.820
but bad roots at Toronto.

01:32:57.820 --> 01:32:59.940
That's a lot of bell holding.

01:32:59.940 --> 01:33:01.700
Yeah, you didn't specify that.

01:33:01.700 --> 01:33:02.860
I feel like you just get the man in a chair.

01:33:02.860 --> 01:33:03.860
I'm going to fuck.

01:33:03.860 --> 01:33:04.860
My hands are getting tired.

01:33:04.860 --> 01:33:05.860
You're not.

01:33:05.860 --> 01:33:06.860
You're not.

01:33:06.860 --> 01:33:07.860
You're not.

01:33:07.860 --> 01:33:08.860
There's no wrong way to zip line.

01:33:08.860 --> 01:33:09.860
I feel like by the time I end New Jersey, I'm dead.

01:33:09.860 --> 01:33:10.860
That's not.

01:33:10.860 --> 01:33:11.860
I can't.

01:33:11.860 --> 01:33:12.860
I can't.

01:33:12.860 --> 01:33:13.860
You're not even talking.

01:33:13.860 --> 01:33:14.860
I can't carry a basket of crap.

01:33:14.860 --> 01:33:15.860
My fingers are bleeding.

01:33:15.860 --> 01:33:16.860
I'm exhausted.

01:33:16.860 --> 01:33:17.860
I'm exhausted.

01:33:17.860 --> 01:33:18.860
I'm sitting on a stool right now.

01:33:18.860 --> 01:33:19.860
Let's not get hung up on how you zip line.

01:33:19.860 --> 01:33:20.860
You're talking about a rope here.

01:33:20.860 --> 01:33:22.860
This isn't a zip line at all.

01:33:22.860 --> 01:33:23.860
Huh?

01:33:23.860 --> 01:33:24.860
Yeah.

01:33:24.860 --> 01:33:25.860
You're talking about like different,

01:33:25.860 --> 01:33:26.860
you're talking about bank robberies.

01:33:26.860 --> 01:33:27.860
Look, you guys.

01:33:27.860 --> 01:33:29.860
That's a different kind of zip lining.

01:33:29.860 --> 01:33:32.860
Oh, the belt is, yeah, the belt is an ad hoc zip line.

01:33:32.860 --> 01:33:34.860
Yeah, this is some action adventure.

01:33:34.860 --> 01:33:36.860
This is a comfort class kind of thing.

01:33:36.860 --> 01:33:40.860
If you want to go to one place to another easily, zoom, starting where?

01:33:40.860 --> 01:33:42.860
This is a theme park grade zip line.

01:33:42.860 --> 01:33:44.860
I'm talking about like you're sitting in a Shaw Walker chair.

01:33:44.860 --> 01:33:46.860
Can I ask one more question?

01:33:46.860 --> 01:33:47.860
Certainly.

01:33:47.860 --> 01:33:48.860
You know, I'm watching Furious 7.

01:33:48.860 --> 01:33:49.860
Before I make Furious 7.

01:33:49.860 --> 01:33:51.860
You know, the best of the Furious franchise.

01:33:51.860 --> 01:33:58.860
Can, is there, can we assume that there's such a thing as a cargo capacity?

01:33:58.860 --> 01:34:00.860
Like, could I, could I travel?

01:34:00.860 --> 01:34:04.860
Could I, could I pretend he needs his dog to fly?

01:34:04.860 --> 01:34:05.860
You get 500.

01:34:05.860 --> 01:34:06.860
I want to bring my dogs.

01:34:06.860 --> 01:34:07.860
500 pounds cargo.

01:34:07.860 --> 01:34:08.860
You get 500 pounds.

01:34:08.860 --> 01:34:09.860
500 pounds.

01:34:09.860 --> 01:34:10.860
Okay.

01:34:10.860 --> 01:34:11.860
Portland.

01:34:11.860 --> 01:34:12.860
Oregon.

01:34:12.860 --> 01:34:13.860
Okay.

01:34:13.860 --> 01:34:14.860
Starting or ending?

01:34:14.860 --> 01:34:15.860
I'm going there.

01:34:15.860 --> 01:34:16.860
The question doesn't.

01:34:16.860 --> 01:34:18.860
You get a starting location and an ending location.

01:34:18.860 --> 01:34:19.860
It's a one way zip line.

01:34:19.860 --> 01:34:21.860
Oh, you can't, you have to walk back.

01:34:21.860 --> 01:34:23.860
It's elevation based.

01:34:23.860 --> 01:34:25.860
You have to zip down.

01:34:25.860 --> 01:34:29.860
You got to take, you have to take a Peter Pan bus home.

01:34:29.860 --> 01:34:30.860
That's the only caveat.

01:34:30.860 --> 01:34:31.860
That's right.

01:34:31.860 --> 01:34:32.860
That's why I said Chuck Lorre had the climate freak.

01:34:32.860 --> 01:34:35.860
You can't one way zip line and then Peter Pan home.

01:34:35.860 --> 01:34:37.860
Hey, it's called zip line bro.

01:34:37.860 --> 01:34:39.860
Like, and live it and live it or don't.

01:34:39.860 --> 01:34:40.860
You know what I mean?

01:34:40.860 --> 01:34:41.860
Hey, I'm not Chuck Lorre.

01:34:41.860 --> 01:34:42.860
I didn't invent this shit.

01:34:42.860 --> 01:34:45.860
That's why Chuck Lorre has the climate freak.

01:34:45.860 --> 01:34:46.860
Blame Chuck Lorre, bro.

01:34:46.860 --> 01:34:50.860
That's why it's got a half a man on that show.

01:34:50.860 --> 01:34:52.860
You can just start to play zip line.

01:34:52.860 --> 01:34:53.860
Boom.

01:34:53.860 --> 01:34:54.860
You go.

01:34:54.860 --> 01:34:55.860
There's bonds.

01:34:55.860 --> 01:34:56.860
You're at end of this.

01:34:56.860 --> 01:35:00.860
So then I'm picking a place that I want to be able to get in a hurry.

01:35:00.860 --> 01:35:02.860
You get to communicate between two places.

01:35:02.860 --> 01:35:03.860
Okay.

01:35:03.860 --> 01:35:04.860
Portland.

01:35:04.860 --> 01:35:05.860
Is this starting or the ending?

01:35:05.860 --> 01:35:06.860
If you're in LA, I'll give you an example.

01:35:06.860 --> 01:35:12.860
If you're in LA and you want a zip line of Portland, it'll take you only like 37 hours

01:35:12.860 --> 01:35:14.860
holding a belt.

01:35:14.860 --> 01:35:16.860
One and a half miles of the air.

01:35:16.860 --> 01:35:19.860
So it's a pretty good way to travel to walk your dogs.

01:35:19.860 --> 01:35:23.860
Cause I was just thinking partland, my dogs love partland, but it's like, wait a minute.

01:35:23.860 --> 01:35:30.860
Two sons of a belt for 32 hours and hold your body weight up with no other harnesses.

01:35:30.860 --> 01:35:34.860
Why are you being such a pussy, Dan?

01:35:34.860 --> 01:35:36.860
It's like you hate traveling.

01:35:36.860 --> 01:35:39.860
Why do you hate traveling so much, Dan?

01:35:39.860 --> 01:35:41.860
You don't want to go to Portland, bro?

01:35:41.860 --> 01:35:42.860
Whatever.

01:35:42.860 --> 01:35:46.860
Hey guys, if I was the host, I could have Portland.

01:35:46.860 --> 01:35:50.860
By the way, I hold my shit up for 32 hours to entertain you people.

01:35:50.860 --> 01:35:53.860
No, this guy.

01:35:53.860 --> 01:35:54.860
What?

01:35:54.860 --> 01:35:55.860
What's going on?

01:35:55.860 --> 01:35:58.860
Spencer did not hesitate on Baton Rouge in Toronto.

01:35:58.860 --> 01:36:02.860
But we praised him for that only because of the assumption about a two-way...

01:36:02.860 --> 01:36:03.860
Oh no, that's not...

01:36:03.860 --> 01:36:04.860
He didn't know it was belt travel.

01:36:04.860 --> 01:36:06.860
Yeah, I didn't know it was belt travel.

01:36:06.860 --> 01:36:08.860
He said, just fucking don't get hung up on the belt.

01:36:08.860 --> 01:36:10.860
I was talking about ropes.

01:36:10.860 --> 01:36:11.860
The belt's a big factor.

01:36:11.860 --> 01:36:12.860
Oh, I mean, I...

01:36:12.860 --> 01:36:13.860
Fuck, man.

01:36:13.860 --> 01:36:14.860
Where else?

01:36:14.860 --> 01:36:19.860
Well, I retract Portland because I wanted to have like a pietta tear there where my dogs could play.

01:36:19.860 --> 01:36:20.860
All right.

01:36:20.860 --> 01:36:22.860
Dude, use Zipline with a couple of dogs.

01:36:22.860 --> 01:36:23.860
It's pretty awesome.

01:36:23.860 --> 01:36:28.860
Where does he have to hold the dogs or do the dogs hold their own belts?

01:36:28.860 --> 01:36:29.860
He's got baby horns.

01:36:29.860 --> 01:36:30.860
I'm allowing him...

01:36:30.860 --> 01:36:32.860
I'm allowing his Zipline 500-pound cargo.

01:36:32.860 --> 01:36:36.860
Do you put like a fucking bacon kong on the end of a belt and a dog is...

01:36:36.860 --> 01:36:37.860
Okay.

01:36:37.860 --> 01:36:38.860
A dog just holds on.

01:36:38.860 --> 01:36:40.860
But you're saying it's elevation-based?

01:36:40.860 --> 01:36:41.860
No, I'm not saying that.

01:36:41.860 --> 01:36:42.860
I'm saying...

01:36:42.860 --> 01:36:43.860
I am.

01:36:43.860 --> 01:36:44.860
You get to Zipline from wherever.

01:36:44.860 --> 01:36:48.860
We might have to build a large tower so you can Zipline so the elevation works.

01:36:48.860 --> 01:36:49.860
No.

01:36:49.860 --> 01:36:50.860
L.A. to Tokyo.

01:36:50.860 --> 01:36:51.860
Okay.

01:36:51.860 --> 01:36:52.860
Let me finish.

01:36:52.860 --> 01:36:54.860
I'm gonna use the money I make bringing...

01:36:54.860 --> 01:36:55.860
What are they like?

01:36:55.860 --> 01:36:56.860
Blue jeans?

01:36:56.860 --> 01:36:57.860
Yeah, blue jeans.

01:36:57.860 --> 01:36:58.860
What's their...

01:36:58.860 --> 01:36:59.860
What's their crawdad?

01:36:59.860 --> 01:37:00.860
They love blue jeans and Cadillacs.

01:37:00.860 --> 01:37:01.860
You should bring a Cadillac.

01:37:01.860 --> 01:37:03.860
You can Zipline a couple of Caddies.

01:37:03.860 --> 01:37:04.860
They love...

01:37:04.860 --> 01:37:05.860
They love sideburns.

01:37:05.860 --> 01:37:07.860
Build another Zipline from Mount Fuji to L.A.

01:37:07.860 --> 01:37:08.860
Huh?

01:37:08.860 --> 01:37:09.860
Mount Fuji.

01:37:09.860 --> 01:37:11.860
Wait, you're going only for mercenary reasons?

01:37:11.860 --> 01:37:12.860
Yeah.

01:37:12.860 --> 01:37:13.860
You're going...

01:37:13.860 --> 01:37:14.860
You mean merchandising?

01:37:14.860 --> 01:37:15.860
Yeah.

01:37:15.860 --> 01:37:18.860
I'm a fucking merc!

01:37:18.860 --> 01:37:20.860
She just came Zipline and didn't kill...

01:37:20.860 --> 01:37:21.860
Okay.

01:37:21.860 --> 01:37:23.860
I mean, back in the 40s, that was the move.

01:37:23.860 --> 01:37:24.860
You know what I mean?

01:37:24.860 --> 01:37:25.860
But now, nobody...

01:37:25.860 --> 01:37:28.860
I could use the word salarian, but you're going for financial interests?

01:37:28.860 --> 01:37:31.860
Mercenary is what I meant, by the way.

01:37:31.860 --> 01:37:33.860
Yeah, mercenary, I feel like...

01:37:33.860 --> 01:37:35.860
I feel like that connotates bloodshed.

01:37:35.860 --> 01:37:39.860
Well, I mean, you're perpetuating, first of all, the myth that it's possible to kill

01:37:39.860 --> 01:37:41.860
a Japanese person, which it's not...

01:37:41.860 --> 01:37:42.860
Which we found out...

01:37:42.860 --> 01:37:43.860
Which we learned...

01:37:43.860 --> 01:37:44.860
We fucking learned that hard way.

01:37:44.860 --> 01:37:45.860
It's a lot of big weapons.

01:37:45.860 --> 01:37:46.860
It is very difficult.

01:37:46.860 --> 01:37:49.860
I think the Baton Death March taught us a lesson or two on that.

01:37:49.860 --> 01:37:50.860
Well, by the way...

01:37:50.860 --> 01:37:51.860
Well, I didn't want to go...

01:37:51.860 --> 01:37:52.860
Nothing worse than the Baton...

01:37:52.860 --> 01:37:53.860
Don't owe me on that, fucking...

01:37:53.860 --> 01:37:58.860
Don't get mixed up between the Baton Death March and the Baton Dime March, which is when...

01:37:58.860 --> 01:38:00.860
Guys, it's a callback.

01:38:00.860 --> 01:38:02.860
UNICEF, UNICEF, everybody.

01:38:02.860 --> 01:38:03.860
I honestly...

01:38:03.860 --> 01:38:04.860
I'm trying to wrap it up.

01:38:04.860 --> 01:38:05.860
I was Ziplining out.

01:38:05.860 --> 01:38:09.860
Once you guys told me about the limitations where it's only one way...

01:38:09.860 --> 01:38:11.860
They're asleep at this point.

01:38:11.860 --> 01:38:20.860
It's just pumping fucking whatever LSD into the crowd right now.

01:38:20.860 --> 01:38:26.860
I'm obsessed with the idea that I need to overcome the limitations that I'm being fenced in by,

01:38:26.860 --> 01:38:32.860
because I'm thinking like, isn't Mount Fuji the highest elevated point somewhere outside...

01:38:32.860 --> 01:38:36.860
The point is that you can't Zipline up hills, so you could start in a sense.

01:38:36.860 --> 01:38:37.860
But you can't...

01:38:37.860 --> 01:38:38.860
Wait, I'm saying it's my ending point.

01:38:38.860 --> 01:38:41.860
Chuck Lorre, he can Zipline up hill.

01:38:41.860 --> 01:38:43.860
I'm not thinking about who invented this.

01:38:43.860 --> 01:38:46.860
Chuck Lorre uses two Ziplines, one for each way.

01:38:46.860 --> 01:38:49.860
Whatever Chuck Lorre goes, any way he wants to go.

01:38:49.860 --> 01:38:51.860
You guys are putting way too many parameters on Ziplining.

01:38:51.860 --> 01:38:54.860
I am a good host, and here's proof we're moving on.

01:38:54.860 --> 01:38:55.860
All right.

01:38:55.860 --> 01:38:57.860
Oh, shit.

01:38:57.860 --> 01:39:01.860
That's a perfect segue.

01:39:01.860 --> 01:39:02.860
You know what?

01:39:02.860 --> 01:39:04.860
The crowd applauds for moving on.

01:39:04.860 --> 01:39:06.860
That means it's...

01:39:06.860 --> 01:39:08.860
They're moving on.

01:39:08.860 --> 01:39:11.860
Does that mean we can go home soon?

01:39:11.860 --> 01:39:13.860
I just want to go home now.

01:39:13.860 --> 01:39:15.860
I do just want to add that I would...

01:39:15.860 --> 01:39:21.860
Since I don't want to waste a Zipline, my starting point would be wherever atheism was invented,

01:39:21.860 --> 01:39:25.860
and I would take it to wherever Reddit is headquartered.

01:39:25.860 --> 01:39:31.860
But I'm not doing that for, you know, approval.

01:39:31.860 --> 01:39:34.860
Zipline effect.

01:39:34.860 --> 01:39:37.860
All right. Next topic, Jews.

01:39:37.860 --> 01:39:38.860
Yes.

01:39:38.860 --> 01:39:41.860
Finally, the reason I came.

01:39:41.860 --> 01:39:43.860
Do they exist?

01:39:43.860 --> 01:39:45.860
Yes.

01:39:45.860 --> 01:39:51.860
Have you seen the Jew footage from Hancock Park?

01:39:51.860 --> 01:39:52.860
I saw it.

01:39:52.860 --> 01:39:54.860
Is that a guy in a suit?

01:39:54.860 --> 01:39:56.860
It's blurry. We don't know.

01:39:56.860 --> 01:39:58.860
Also, I hate when people shoot...

01:39:58.860 --> 01:40:00.860
Vertical.

01:40:00.860 --> 01:40:02.860
Vertical iPhone.

01:40:02.860 --> 01:40:05.860
By the way, if you see someone...

01:40:05.860 --> 01:40:07.860
A policeman shooting a black guy, please shoot him.

01:40:07.860 --> 01:40:09.860
Landscape it, motherfuckers.

01:40:09.860 --> 01:40:13.860
He's not gonna kill another black guy above him.

01:40:13.860 --> 01:40:16.860
That's the one place you know you don't...

01:40:16.860 --> 01:40:20.860
Either way, I have to watch this killing on a fucking H.C.T.V.

01:40:20.860 --> 01:40:22.860
I'm not a pauper.

01:40:22.860 --> 01:40:25.860
I Zipline to Best Buy for my shit.

01:40:25.860 --> 01:40:27.860
What do you think I am?

01:40:27.860 --> 01:40:31.860
If we go to war with Mole Man or helicopter people...

01:40:31.860 --> 01:40:33.860
Then escape it.

01:40:33.860 --> 01:40:36.860
Even if it's a black.

01:40:36.860 --> 01:40:39.860
The point is...

01:40:39.860 --> 01:40:41.860
Say it then.

01:40:41.860 --> 01:40:43.860
Perfect time to say it.

01:40:43.860 --> 01:40:45.860
Listen, here's the reason I said that,

01:40:45.860 --> 01:40:49.860
because I'm not scared of one black person who's in the UCB.

01:40:49.860 --> 01:40:52.860
Now, if we were at some other kind of improv theater,

01:40:52.860 --> 01:40:55.860
I may be frightened, but I've seen UCB blacks.

01:40:55.860 --> 01:40:57.860
I can take them.

01:40:57.860 --> 01:40:59.860
What is he doing?

01:40:59.860 --> 01:41:02.860
Yes, and I can beat them up.

01:41:02.860 --> 01:41:04.860
That's good.

01:41:04.860 --> 01:41:06.860
Did you just challenge all UCB blacks to a fight?

01:41:06.860 --> 01:41:08.860
Here's the thing, if you put the lights on here,

01:41:08.860 --> 01:41:10.860
there's probably two black dudes in this whole fucking theater.

01:41:10.860 --> 01:41:12.860
And you think they're both physically weaker?

01:41:12.860 --> 01:41:14.860
That's your problem, not my problem.

01:41:14.860 --> 01:41:17.860
You should hang out with more black people, assholes.

01:41:17.860 --> 01:41:19.860
I have a lot of black friends.

01:41:19.860 --> 01:41:21.860
You're just not here because you know it's Sunday.

01:41:21.860 --> 01:41:23.860
You keep beating them up.

01:41:23.860 --> 01:41:25.860
Because there's Zipline at all sorts of cool places.

01:41:25.860 --> 01:41:27.860
Because some friends are the really rich blacks.

01:41:27.860 --> 01:41:29.860
They went to Costco, they're going somewhere fun.

01:41:29.860 --> 01:41:31.860
Yes, exactly.

01:41:31.860 --> 01:41:33.860
These guys might hang out with all kinds of black people.

01:41:33.860 --> 01:41:35.860
By the way, this is the thing that happens.

01:41:35.860 --> 01:41:37.860
This is like a lot, the younger crowd's grown a lot.

01:41:37.860 --> 01:41:39.860
They get really scared when you talk about shit.

01:41:39.860 --> 01:41:41.860
That's like controversial.

01:41:41.860 --> 01:41:43.860
Well, they get yelled at a lot.

01:41:43.860 --> 01:41:45.860
They do get yelled at a lot.

01:41:45.860 --> 01:41:47.860
That's not your fault.

01:41:47.860 --> 01:41:49.860
You come from a generation of you can't say anything.

01:41:49.860 --> 01:41:51.860
Which is great, because I think it's better that we're all exactly the same.

01:41:51.860 --> 01:41:53.860
They have to deal with more...

01:41:53.860 --> 01:41:55.860
I think we should kill culture.

01:41:55.860 --> 01:41:57.860
That's what I think.

01:41:57.860 --> 01:41:59.860
I think that Applebee...

01:41:59.860 --> 01:42:01.860
I think Olive Garden should be Italian food, that's what I think.

01:42:01.860 --> 01:42:03.860
Speaking of culture...

01:42:03.860 --> 01:42:05.860
Whitewash culture, guys, that's a good call.

01:42:05.860 --> 01:42:07.860
How do you segue?

01:42:07.860 --> 01:42:09.860
Oh, no, don't...

01:42:09.860 --> 01:42:11.860
I mean, because I'm telling you...

01:42:11.860 --> 01:42:13.860
He's had half of it.

01:42:13.860 --> 01:42:15.860
It'll hit you like a 20 minutes...

01:42:15.860 --> 01:42:17.860
It hit him right before he started talking about black people.

01:42:17.860 --> 01:42:19.860
No, I was...

01:42:19.860 --> 01:42:21.860
This is all written.

01:42:21.860 --> 01:42:23.860
It's just like...

01:42:23.860 --> 01:42:25.860
I was talking about black people I wrote this a week ago.

01:42:25.860 --> 01:42:27.860
I was just thrilled to have an opportunity.

01:42:27.860 --> 01:42:29.860
Let's bring up...

01:42:29.860 --> 01:42:31.860
This seems like a good time.

01:42:31.860 --> 01:42:33.860
Let's bring up my beautiful wife, Erin.

01:42:33.860 --> 01:42:35.860
Not that her beauty is the thing that makes her valuable.

01:42:35.860 --> 01:42:37.860
Oh, boy.

01:42:37.860 --> 01:42:39.860
Caveatime!

01:42:39.860 --> 01:42:41.860
We're going to take that intro one more time.

01:42:41.860 --> 01:42:43.860
Take two.

01:42:43.860 --> 01:42:45.860
Intro of your wife.

01:42:45.860 --> 01:42:47.860
20 minutes.

01:42:47.860 --> 01:42:49.860
Let's bring up my autonomous collaborator

01:42:49.860 --> 01:42:51.860
in marital life.

01:42:51.860 --> 01:42:53.860
Who often

01:42:53.860 --> 01:42:55.860
makes decisions

01:42:55.860 --> 01:42:57.860
that have nothing to do with...

01:42:57.860 --> 01:42:59.860
Fantastic decisions.

01:42:59.860 --> 01:43:01.860
That always seem to make sense, even after the fact.

01:43:01.860 --> 01:43:03.860
Erin McGathy!

01:43:03.860 --> 01:43:05.860
CHEERING

01:43:05.860 --> 01:43:07.860
MUSIC

01:43:07.860 --> 01:43:09.860
MUSIC

01:43:09.860 --> 01:43:11.860
MUSIC

01:43:11.860 --> 01:43:13.860
MUSIC

01:43:13.860 --> 01:43:15.860
All right, that's it. Thanks for coming.

01:43:15.860 --> 01:43:17.860
Does that mic work?

01:43:17.860 --> 01:43:19.860
Hi. Hi, guys.

01:43:19.860 --> 01:43:21.860
I've been having a good time.

01:43:21.860 --> 01:43:23.860
I don't know what...

01:43:23.860 --> 01:43:25.860
I don't know what our situation is in terms of...

01:43:25.860 --> 01:43:27.860
Usually, there's a clock and...

01:43:27.860 --> 01:43:29.860
I got the clock.

01:43:29.860 --> 01:43:31.860
You think we're close to having a role into playing?

01:43:31.860 --> 01:43:33.860
We don't serve breakfast here, so we should go...

01:43:33.860 --> 01:43:35.860
I just wanted to say,

01:43:35.860 --> 01:43:37.860
when Dave Chappelle comes to the Comedy Center,

01:43:37.860 --> 01:43:39.860
he's just at 3 in the morning.

01:43:39.860 --> 01:43:41.860
Well, I mean, you know,

01:43:41.860 --> 01:43:43.860
we don't want to get back into that area.

01:43:43.860 --> 01:43:45.860
LAUGHTER

01:43:45.860 --> 01:43:47.860
The...

01:43:47.860 --> 01:43:49.860
First of all, you've been sitting there for

01:43:49.860 --> 01:43:51.860
an hour and a half.

01:43:51.860 --> 01:43:53.860
Do you get any little zingers up your sleeve?

01:43:53.860 --> 01:43:55.860
My ass is hard as a rock.

01:43:55.860 --> 01:43:57.860
Yeah!

01:43:57.860 --> 01:43:59.860
Like a 12-year-old.

01:43:59.860 --> 01:44:01.860
UCB Blacks is my favorite

01:44:01.860 --> 01:44:03.860
Herald team.

01:44:03.860 --> 01:44:05.860
LAUGHTER

01:44:05.860 --> 01:44:07.860
And I'd

01:44:07.860 --> 01:44:09.860
zip-line into the Grand Canyon

01:44:09.860 --> 01:44:11.860
because it sounds like the zip-lines

01:44:11.860 --> 01:44:13.860
pointless for travel and commerce.

01:44:13.860 --> 01:44:15.860
But it would be cool

01:44:15.860 --> 01:44:17.860
to fly into the Grand Canyon.

01:44:17.860 --> 01:44:19.860
LAUGHTER

01:44:19.860 --> 01:44:21.860
CHEERING

01:44:21.860 --> 01:44:23.860
That's why...

01:44:23.860 --> 01:44:25.860
That's why the show

01:44:25.860 --> 01:44:27.860
shouldn't have always been men the entire time.

01:44:27.860 --> 01:44:29.860
I would arrange...

01:44:29.860 --> 01:44:31.860
You know how you can write a donkey

01:44:31.860 --> 01:44:33.860
up and down the Grand Canyon?

01:44:33.860 --> 01:44:35.860
They're human beings.

01:44:35.860 --> 01:44:37.860
No, no, no, no.

01:44:37.860 --> 01:44:39.860
Some are actual donkeys.

01:44:39.860 --> 01:44:41.860
I thought you were talking about...

01:44:41.860 --> 01:44:43.860
I would write a park ranger.

01:44:43.860 --> 01:44:45.860
Never mind.

01:44:45.860 --> 01:44:47.860
If I had a zip-line, I would give my zip-line

01:44:47.860 --> 01:44:49.860
to a donkey so he could go up and down.

01:44:49.860 --> 01:44:51.860
You want to drink this, too?

01:44:51.860 --> 01:44:53.860
It's good. I know it's good, but it's dangerous.

01:44:53.860 --> 01:44:55.860
It's only just twice as strong

01:44:55.860 --> 01:44:57.860
as vodka. It's like

01:44:57.860 --> 01:44:59.860
taking two drinks of vodka.

01:44:59.860 --> 01:45:01.860
It's not that simple.

01:45:01.860 --> 01:45:03.860
It is not.

01:45:03.860 --> 01:45:05.860
It feels like I had just

01:45:05.860 --> 01:45:07.860
four sips of vodka.

01:45:07.860 --> 01:45:09.860
I don't want to fight about this, and you do.

01:45:09.860 --> 01:45:11.860
I'd love to.

01:45:11.860 --> 01:45:13.860
I won't let you.

01:45:13.860 --> 01:45:15.860
Jeff, I feel like

01:45:15.860 --> 01:45:17.860
you were insisting on that question

01:45:17.860 --> 01:45:19.860
because you really wanted someone to ask you.

01:45:19.860 --> 01:45:21.860
No, no, I just...

01:45:21.860 --> 01:45:23.860
Oh, where would you, Jeff?

01:45:23.860 --> 01:45:25.860
I'm sure Jeff has

01:45:25.860 --> 01:45:27.860
an answer that's like the piazza

01:45:27.860 --> 01:45:29.860
by the Colosseum

01:45:29.860 --> 01:45:31.860
that notes me

01:45:31.860 --> 01:45:33.860
where they make my special

01:45:33.860 --> 01:45:35.860
drink. I would go...

01:45:35.860 --> 01:45:37.860
I would make a zip-line from your dad's house

01:45:37.860 --> 01:45:39.860
to Dan's mom's pussy.

01:45:39.860 --> 01:45:41.860
Don't...

01:45:41.860 --> 01:45:43.860
Wait, does that mean you...

01:45:43.860 --> 01:45:45.860
Does that mean...

01:45:45.860 --> 01:45:47.860
I heard the traffic on that one.

01:45:47.860 --> 01:45:49.860
I bet it was in Venice.

01:45:49.860 --> 01:45:51.860
They make...

01:45:51.860 --> 01:45:53.860
The perfect Negroni there.

01:45:53.860 --> 01:45:55.860
Dan.

01:45:55.860 --> 01:45:57.860
I did not have...

01:45:57.860 --> 01:45:59.860
I don't want to be a dick, but I just looked at

01:45:59.860 --> 01:46:01.860
fucking Waze's zip-line, and the traffic

01:46:01.860 --> 01:46:03.860
to your mom's pussy is backed up.

01:46:03.860 --> 01:46:05.860
Yeah, but a lot of people

01:46:05.860 --> 01:46:07.860
falsely report that to see if they can

01:46:07.860 --> 01:46:09.860
hack the system.

01:46:09.860 --> 01:46:11.860
Every time I zip-line into your mom's pussy, Chuck

01:46:11.860 --> 01:46:13.860
Lloyd's right in front of me every fucking time.

01:46:13.860 --> 01:46:15.860
Yeah, boy, that guy,

01:46:15.860 --> 01:46:17.860
he takes his time.

01:46:17.860 --> 01:46:19.860
Are you zip-lining from my dad's house because you're gonna fuck my dad?

01:46:19.860 --> 01:46:21.860
Oh!

01:46:21.860 --> 01:46:23.860
I have joke.

01:46:23.860 --> 01:46:25.860
I think in my mind, I've just fucked your dad.

01:46:25.860 --> 01:46:27.860
I could refresh myself a little bit

01:46:27.860 --> 01:46:29.860
of Dan's mom's pussy.

01:46:29.860 --> 01:46:31.860
I didn't follow that, but...

01:46:31.860 --> 01:46:33.860
Do you think it would be gross?

01:46:33.860 --> 01:46:35.860
For the record, I approve of everything he just said.

01:46:35.860 --> 01:46:37.860
And I approve of

01:46:37.860 --> 01:46:39.860
social progress at atheism.

01:46:39.860 --> 01:46:41.860
At New York.

01:46:41.860 --> 01:46:43.860
What a bold sense.

01:46:43.860 --> 01:46:45.860
And IFC and UCB.

01:46:45.860 --> 01:46:47.860
And just not UNICEF.

01:46:47.860 --> 01:46:49.860
You're brave, man.

01:46:49.860 --> 01:46:51.860
I take brave stances.

01:46:51.860 --> 01:46:53.860
Joe, can we talk...

01:46:53.860 --> 01:46:55.860
Can we talk about the young East Village?

01:46:55.860 --> 01:46:57.860
Dan, this is neither the time nor the place.

01:46:57.860 --> 01:46:59.860
Can we talk just a little bit?

01:46:59.860 --> 01:47:01.860
Without Jesus and what he means to everybody

01:47:01.860 --> 01:47:03.860
for a second?

01:47:03.860 --> 01:47:05.860
Maybe to close your legs for a second,

01:47:05.860 --> 01:47:07.860
you man-spreading fucking horse.

01:47:07.860 --> 01:47:09.860
He's so drunk.

01:47:09.860 --> 01:47:11.860
You never heard about man-spreading?

01:47:11.860 --> 01:47:13.860
That's a big thing in New York.

01:47:13.860 --> 01:47:15.860
You can't do this on the subway.

01:47:15.860 --> 01:47:17.860
Oh, yeah, I remember that.

01:47:17.860 --> 01:47:19.860
New York has literally made balls illegal.

01:47:19.860 --> 01:47:21.860
You can't, you have to sit like this.

01:47:21.860 --> 01:47:23.860
Regardless of how elephant-ly

01:47:23.860 --> 01:47:25.860
large your balls are,

01:47:25.860 --> 01:47:27.860
you can't do this because maybe you have problems.

01:47:27.860 --> 01:47:29.860
But you also can't do that

01:47:29.860 --> 01:47:31.860
if you're any gender.

01:47:31.860 --> 01:47:33.860
It's more...

01:47:33.860 --> 01:47:35.860
I'm sorry, in the summertime,

01:47:35.860 --> 01:47:37.860
my balls dangle to a place where this is the only way

01:47:37.860 --> 01:47:39.860
I can sit.

01:47:39.860 --> 01:47:41.860
Deal with it, assholes, okay?

01:47:41.860 --> 01:47:43.860
I'm a cisgender straight male

01:47:43.860 --> 01:47:45.860
with large balls.

01:47:45.860 --> 01:47:47.860
Do I not have rights anymore?

01:47:47.860 --> 01:47:49.860
Yeah, they can't handle it.

01:47:49.860 --> 01:47:51.860
They can't deal with it.

01:47:51.860 --> 01:47:53.860
They're like, I don't know, our generation has small balls.

01:47:53.860 --> 01:47:55.860
This show is brought to you by Absence.

01:47:55.860 --> 01:47:57.860
Your reaction to Absence

01:47:57.860 --> 01:47:59.860
has made you into an incredible volatile lunatic.

01:47:59.860 --> 01:48:01.860
It's about time we talked about my balls.

01:48:01.860 --> 01:48:03.860
It's really great.

01:48:03.860 --> 01:48:05.860
I read the web. I know what people want to talk about.

01:48:05.860 --> 01:48:07.860
It's bringing the wrong Belushi out of you.

01:48:11.860 --> 01:48:13.860
Wait, is there a line?

01:48:13.860 --> 01:48:15.860
Is there a right Belushi?

01:48:15.860 --> 01:48:17.860
Yes, there is.

01:48:17.860 --> 01:48:19.860
Did Jim Belushi the correct Belushi to be?

01:48:19.860 --> 01:48:21.860
No. Oh, God.

01:48:21.860 --> 01:48:23.860
No, that Jim Belushi is the one you become.

01:48:23.860 --> 01:48:25.860
But with the other ones dead,

01:48:25.860 --> 01:48:27.860
I feel like there's no good Belushi in this story.

01:48:27.860 --> 01:48:29.860
Oh, well, if you think dead people are bad.

01:48:29.860 --> 01:48:31.860
Yes, I do.

01:48:31.860 --> 01:48:33.860
That's not a brave stance.

01:48:33.860 --> 01:48:35.860
They can't defend themselves.

01:48:35.860 --> 01:48:37.860
Rory, did you know that Kool-Aid used to have a different name?

01:48:37.860 --> 01:48:39.860
That's true.

01:48:39.860 --> 01:48:41.860
This is not a bit.

01:48:41.860 --> 01:48:43.860
Wait, who did?

01:48:43.860 --> 01:48:45.860
Abe Lincoln.

01:48:45.860 --> 01:48:47.860
Kool-Aid.

01:48:47.860 --> 01:48:49.860
Why did I hear Abe Lincoln?

01:48:49.860 --> 01:48:51.860
Because you're writing on the show about history.

01:48:51.860 --> 01:48:53.860
Right now I'm doing that?

01:48:53.860 --> 01:48:55.860
No, I brought up Abe Lincoln.

01:48:55.860 --> 01:48:57.860
Go ahead, go ahead.

01:48:57.860 --> 01:48:59.860
Abe Lincoln freed the slaves.

01:48:59.860 --> 01:49:01.860
Black people like Kool-Aid, I get it. Go ahead.

01:49:01.860 --> 01:49:03.860
It's a connection that she made.

01:49:03.860 --> 01:49:05.860
I didn't make that connection.

01:49:05.860 --> 01:49:07.860
I just want to say, I just want to say,

01:49:07.860 --> 01:49:09.860
I think the UCB Blacks is a great team,

01:49:09.860 --> 01:49:11.860
but I think that their third beats are really weak.

01:49:11.860 --> 01:49:13.860
When you're going to see them.

01:49:13.860 --> 01:49:15.860
Yeah, you see?

01:49:15.860 --> 01:49:17.860
That's what they do to you, these people.

01:49:17.860 --> 01:49:19.860
They love you and then they fucking hate you.

01:49:19.860 --> 01:49:21.860
No, no.

01:49:21.860 --> 01:49:23.860
By the way, I used to have a joke about the Kool-Aid man.

01:49:23.860 --> 01:49:25.860
You guys wrote about the Kool-Aid man in my stand-up bag.

01:49:25.860 --> 01:49:27.860
Give it to Jonestown Massacre.

01:49:27.860 --> 01:49:29.860
You did a bit about it?

01:49:29.860 --> 01:49:31.860
Yes, but you did stand up and have the massacre?

01:49:31.860 --> 01:49:33.860
No, because the Kool-Aid massacre, they all drank

01:49:33.860 --> 01:49:35.860
Kool-Aid flavorade.

01:49:35.860 --> 01:49:37.860
And then the whole point was the Kool-Aid man bust through

01:49:37.860 --> 01:49:39.860
and was like, oh, no.

01:49:39.860 --> 01:49:41.860
And then you see, that's what he says.

01:49:41.860 --> 01:49:43.860
Oh, no, yeah.

01:49:43.860 --> 01:49:45.860
But Jonestown, people who like the history,

01:49:45.860 --> 01:49:47.860
you get that one.

01:49:47.860 --> 01:49:49.860
If you don't like that joke,

01:49:49.860 --> 01:49:51.860
it's because you haven't read enough.

01:49:51.860 --> 01:49:53.860
That's your fault, because that's a good joke.

01:49:53.860 --> 01:49:55.860
Because reading a big, thick,

01:49:55.860 --> 01:49:57.860
dense academic book

01:49:57.860 --> 01:49:59.860
is the only way

01:49:59.860 --> 01:50:01.860
to know

01:50:01.860 --> 01:50:03.860
that Jonestown and Kool-Aid

01:50:03.860 --> 01:50:05.860
are dots you can connect.

01:50:05.860 --> 01:50:07.860
Hey, guys.

01:50:07.860 --> 01:50:09.860
Guys, take your zipper out of my stand-up bag.

01:50:09.860 --> 01:50:11.860
It's low elevation.

01:50:11.860 --> 01:50:13.860
You'll get there very fast.

01:50:13.860 --> 01:50:15.860
It's right below the ground.

01:50:15.860 --> 01:50:17.860
It's ground zero, comedically.

01:50:17.860 --> 01:50:19.860
It's where the action is.

01:50:19.860 --> 01:50:21.860
Kool-Aid

01:50:21.860 --> 01:50:23.860
was invented

01:50:23.860 --> 01:50:25.860
in 1920.

01:50:25.860 --> 01:50:27.860
It's true.

01:50:27.860 --> 01:50:29.860
No, this is not a bit.

01:50:29.860 --> 01:50:31.860
When you guys were talking about Kool-Aid,

01:50:31.860 --> 01:50:33.860
I got a little bored and I Googled Kool-Aid.

01:50:33.860 --> 01:50:35.860
It's a good show.

01:50:35.860 --> 01:50:37.860
It's a great show.

01:50:37.860 --> 01:50:39.860
I didn't get bored.

01:50:39.860 --> 01:50:41.860
I was just interested in Kool-Aid.

01:50:41.860 --> 01:50:43.860
And it's funny because you said,

01:50:43.860 --> 01:50:45.860
when you made the joke about,

01:50:45.860 --> 01:50:47.860
oh, you guys will look it up later,

01:50:47.860 --> 01:50:49.860
and I was looking it up,

01:50:49.860 --> 01:50:51.860
and as you were saying, you'll look it up later.

01:50:51.860 --> 01:50:53.860
Anyway, it was originally called

01:50:53.860 --> 01:50:55.860
fruit smack.

01:50:55.860 --> 01:50:57.860
And it was only changed in the 50s.

01:50:57.860 --> 01:50:59.860
Fruit smack.

01:50:59.860 --> 01:51:01.860
But then they found out

01:51:01.860 --> 01:51:03.860
that that's what Hitler's first

01:51:03.860 --> 01:51:05.860
schlieffen plan was called.

01:51:05.860 --> 01:51:07.860
Before he...

01:51:07.860 --> 01:51:09.860
You have to take it all the way

01:51:09.860 --> 01:51:11.860
to the turn left

01:51:11.860 --> 01:51:13.860
when you hit the channel.

01:51:13.860 --> 01:51:15.860
If your right foot hits the English channel,

01:51:15.860 --> 01:51:17.860
it's called operation fruit smack.

01:51:17.860 --> 01:51:19.860
Also, on the Kool-Aid site,

01:51:19.860 --> 01:51:21.860
when you're Googling,

01:51:21.860 --> 01:51:23.860
and it has a blurb, the first text from the site,

01:51:23.860 --> 01:51:25.860
and it said,

01:51:25.860 --> 01:51:27.860
Kool-Aid was invented by a great, kind,

01:51:27.860 --> 01:51:29.860
wonderful man.

01:51:29.860 --> 01:51:31.860
He's very defensive.

01:51:31.860 --> 01:51:33.860
I think he may have hit someone with those cards.

01:51:33.860 --> 01:51:35.860
That sounds like Steven Seagal's page.

01:51:35.860 --> 01:51:37.860
Oh, my God.

01:51:37.860 --> 01:51:39.860
Go treat yourself.

01:51:39.860 --> 01:51:41.860
Go to Steven Seagal's IMDB page

01:51:41.860 --> 01:51:43.860
and read his biography.

01:51:43.860 --> 01:51:45.860
It's like,

01:51:45.860 --> 01:51:47.860
well, yeah.

01:51:47.860 --> 01:51:49.860
My IMDB page is so,

01:51:49.860 --> 01:51:51.860
like, absolutely fallacious.

01:51:51.860 --> 01:51:53.860
I think I'm dating the Grand Duchess Anastasia

01:51:53.860 --> 01:51:55.860
from 1918, like Jefferson Davis, probably.

01:51:55.860 --> 01:51:57.860
No, me.

01:51:57.860 --> 01:51:59.860
It's like, who writes it?

01:51:59.860 --> 01:52:01.860
That must be terrible to have people

01:52:01.860 --> 01:52:03.860
care so much about your career

01:52:03.860 --> 01:52:05.860
that they're making up stuff.

01:52:05.860 --> 01:52:07.860
What?

01:52:07.860 --> 01:52:09.860
Where would you zipline?

01:52:09.860 --> 01:52:11.860
By the way,

01:52:11.860 --> 01:52:13.860
for my Teen Wolf fans out there,

01:52:13.860 --> 01:52:15.860
I want you to know that Season 5

01:52:15.860 --> 01:52:17.860
is going to be a real doozy.

01:52:17.860 --> 01:52:19.860
Get ready

01:52:19.860 --> 01:52:21.860
for some wolves fucking

01:52:21.860 --> 01:52:23.860
and some

01:52:23.860 --> 01:52:25.860
werewolves

01:52:25.860 --> 01:52:27.860
turning into wolves and fucking wolves.

01:52:27.860 --> 01:52:29.860
It's going to be good.

01:52:29.860 --> 01:52:31.860
You promised at the Austin Television Festival

01:52:31.860 --> 01:52:33.860
you wouldn't go there.

01:52:33.860 --> 01:52:35.860
Dan,

01:52:35.860 --> 01:52:37.860
look,

01:52:37.860 --> 01:52:39.860
as Jeff Davis,

01:52:39.860 --> 01:52:41.860
that creator of Teen Wolf,

01:52:41.860 --> 01:52:43.860
the people think I am,

01:52:43.860 --> 01:52:45.860
I'm going to give the people what they fucking want,

01:52:45.860 --> 01:52:47.860
and what the people want is wolves fucking.

01:52:47.860 --> 01:52:49.860
It's going to be doggy style.

01:52:49.860 --> 01:52:51.860
Mr. Davis,

01:52:51.860 --> 01:52:53.860
what do you call the show when he turns 20?

01:52:53.860 --> 01:52:55.860
Wolf.

01:52:55.860 --> 01:52:57.860
That's our show, everybody.

01:52:57.860 --> 01:52:59.860
Oh, that may be your show,

01:52:59.860 --> 01:53:01.860
but mine requires

01:53:01.860 --> 01:53:03.860
a little bit more.

01:53:03.860 --> 01:53:05.860
Now, Dan, look, we started off...

01:53:05.860 --> 01:53:07.860
That's my...

01:53:07.860 --> 01:53:09.860
It requires my weird cigar box dick.

01:53:09.860 --> 01:53:11.860
Dan.

01:53:11.860 --> 01:53:13.860
I don't believe in astrology as such,

01:53:13.860 --> 01:53:15.860
but I do know that if you describe a Libra,

01:53:15.860 --> 01:53:17.860
you describe me very well, I believe in balance.

01:53:17.860 --> 01:53:19.860
We started off the show

01:53:19.860 --> 01:53:21.860
with you doing a very poor rap,

01:53:21.860 --> 01:53:23.860
and I think we've gone through

01:53:23.860 --> 01:53:25.860
a couple good ones.

01:53:25.860 --> 01:53:27.860
I think the only way to end the show,

01:53:27.860 --> 01:53:29.860
because we must, because we just got the...

01:53:29.860 --> 01:53:31.860
We don't have time to...

01:53:31.860 --> 01:53:33.860
We flew Spencer out to...

01:53:33.860 --> 01:53:35.860
You guys have been on stage for eight hours.

01:53:35.860 --> 01:53:37.860
My interpreter this time, that guy gave us

01:53:37.860 --> 01:53:39.860
more. They love it.

01:53:39.860 --> 01:53:41.860
He was giving a high five.

01:53:41.860 --> 01:53:43.860
He's like, you know what, just drag the show

01:53:43.860 --> 01:53:45.860
across my throat. It's so good.

01:53:45.860 --> 01:53:47.860
It's curing my...

01:53:47.860 --> 01:53:49.860
My lymphatic cancer.

01:53:49.860 --> 01:53:51.860
Don't stop.

01:53:51.860 --> 01:53:53.860
Never stop.

01:53:53.860 --> 01:53:55.860
Five more years.

01:53:55.860 --> 01:53:57.860
You're massaging my throat with your great show.

01:53:57.860 --> 01:53:59.860
My room is 555.

01:53:59.860 --> 01:54:01.860
You're just drawing the cancer out of my lung.

01:54:01.860 --> 01:54:03.860
I just love that.

01:54:03.860 --> 01:54:05.860
Making an inhuman neck.

01:54:05.860 --> 01:54:07.860
Giraffe.

01:54:07.860 --> 01:54:09.860
You know, in the audience right now,

01:54:09.860 --> 01:54:11.860
there are people that have never heard the podcast

01:54:11.860 --> 01:54:13.860
and don't know what the show is.

01:54:13.860 --> 01:54:15.860
Giraffe the show, if you're not happy with that,

01:54:15.860 --> 01:54:17.860
fucking kill yourself. Giraffe the show.

01:54:17.860 --> 01:54:19.860
Giraffe the show.

01:54:19.860 --> 01:54:21.860
Don't really...

01:54:21.860 --> 01:54:23.860
Rory.

01:54:23.860 --> 01:54:25.860
Rory, take it.

01:54:25.860 --> 01:54:27.860
Rory, you're first, baby.

01:54:27.860 --> 01:54:29.860
I don't know how to rap.

01:54:29.860 --> 01:54:31.860
Rory.

01:54:31.860 --> 01:54:33.860
Don't tell me to get really racist.

01:54:33.860 --> 01:54:35.860
Don't tell me to get really racist.

01:54:35.860 --> 01:54:37.860
East to the south, to the street, to the hat.

01:54:37.860 --> 01:54:39.860
I fucked your mama.

01:54:39.860 --> 01:54:41.860
My name was that guy.

01:54:41.860 --> 01:54:43.860
That fucks your mama.

01:54:43.860 --> 01:54:45.860
And then, I came all in a llama.

01:54:45.860 --> 01:54:47.860
Sometimes I go to easy places for a rhyme,

01:54:47.860 --> 01:54:49.860
but I won't say that I fucked your mama

01:54:49.860 --> 01:54:51.860
in the word time because time rhymes

01:54:51.860 --> 01:54:53.860
with rhyme and everyone knows that,

01:54:53.860 --> 01:54:55.860
but I fucked your mama so hard and she lost her hat.

01:54:55.860 --> 01:54:57.860
Then I helped her find it

01:54:57.860 --> 01:54:59.860
in a mall. She couldn't find it.

01:54:59.860 --> 01:55:01.860
She was in a toilet stall,

01:55:01.860 --> 01:55:03.860
but your mama doesn't poop, so we don't know why.

01:55:03.860 --> 01:55:05.860
And then I fucked your daddy in his eye.

01:55:05.860 --> 01:55:07.860
Meta.

01:55:07.860 --> 01:55:09.860
Yo, got a socket for an eye.

01:55:09.860 --> 01:55:11.860
You can fuck him right in the eye.

01:55:11.860 --> 01:55:13.860
When I really fucking hold his head,

01:55:13.860 --> 01:55:15.860
I put my dick in his fucking eye hole.

01:55:15.860 --> 01:55:17.860
Yeah, what?

01:55:17.860 --> 01:55:19.860
What?

01:55:19.860 --> 01:55:21.860
What?

01:55:21.860 --> 01:55:23.860
Just a copper pot.

01:55:23.860 --> 01:55:25.860
I'm just damning people from going here.

01:55:25.860 --> 01:55:27.860
Erin McGathy, I'm the mic.

01:55:27.860 --> 01:55:29.860
You guys are wasted on some

01:55:29.860 --> 01:55:31.860
absence and I'm sitting here like

01:55:31.860 --> 01:55:33.860
a perfect nymph because

01:55:33.860 --> 01:55:35.860
when I spread my legs

01:55:35.860 --> 01:55:37.860
on the subway, it's a party.

01:55:37.860 --> 01:55:39.860
It's a foul.

01:55:39.860 --> 01:55:41.860
Thank you for coming to Hurray Town, you guys.

01:55:43.860 --> 01:55:45.860
That's been our three-hour show. We love you so much.

01:55:47.860 --> 01:55:49.860
Rory Albanese, am I saying that right?

01:55:49.860 --> 01:55:51.860
How do you say it? Albanese.

01:55:51.860 --> 01:55:53.860
Albanese.

01:55:53.860 --> 01:55:55.860
Hey, Albanese.

01:55:55.860 --> 01:55:57.860
You're the fight that Dan and I will have later.

01:55:57.860 --> 01:55:59.860
Dan Horbin on I am sick.

01:55:59.860 --> 01:56:01.860
It is dedicated to you.

01:56:01.860 --> 01:56:03.860
Shane, forgetting everybody absolutely murdered on Napson.

01:56:03.860 --> 01:56:05.860
You're in the Gathey, Spencer Crittenden,

01:56:05.860 --> 01:56:07.860
and I'm Jeff Davis.

01:56:07.860 --> 01:56:09.860
Dan Harmon, your mayor, everybody.

01:56:13.860 --> 01:56:15.860
Go, Erin, go.

01:56:15.860 --> 01:56:17.860
Tabith.

01:56:17.860 --> 01:56:19.860
Yo, yo, yo.

01:56:19.860 --> 01:56:21.860
Secret track.

01:56:21.860 --> 01:56:23.860
You thought I was gone, but now I'm back.

01:56:23.860 --> 01:56:25.860
Secret track, you cannot leave.

01:56:25.860 --> 01:56:27.860
You can never, ever leave.

01:56:27.860 --> 01:56:29.860
You have to stay.

01:56:29.860 --> 01:56:31.860
Secret track, new podcast.

01:56:31.860 --> 01:56:33.860
This one's just 20 minutes long, but it's like

01:56:33.860 --> 01:56:35.860
Talking Dead.

01:56:35.860 --> 01:56:37.860
Yo, yo, yo.

01:56:37.860 --> 01:56:39.860
What was that episode about?

01:56:39.860 --> 01:56:41.860
Well, we're here live after watching that episode,

01:56:41.860 --> 01:56:43.860
and it was pretty fucking weird.

01:56:43.860 --> 01:56:45.860
My name is Chris Hardware.

01:56:47.860 --> 01:56:49.860
Door prizes, bottle openers,

01:56:49.860 --> 01:56:51.860
random words.

01:56:51.860 --> 01:56:53.860
Flowers.

01:56:53.860 --> 01:56:55.860
This is the most exercise Dan gets, you guys.

01:56:59.860 --> 01:57:01.860
All right, thank you.

01:57:01.860 --> 01:57:03.860
I hope to see some of you at the taping on Wednesday

01:57:03.860 --> 01:57:05.860
if you were able to make it in there.

01:57:05.860 --> 01:57:07.860
Rory Albanese, I don't know why I'm re-ending the show.

01:57:07.860 --> 01:57:09.860
Thank you, Jeff.

01:57:09.860 --> 01:57:11.860
Thank you, everybody.

01:57:11.860 --> 01:57:21.860
Sorry if I didn't get to play the game.

01:57:21.860 --> 01:57:23.860
Did you get any of that?

01:57:23.860 --> 01:57:41.860
No, I didn't.
