{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:20.000\nLadies and gentlemen, welcome to Harmontown!\n\n00:20.000 --> 00:37.000\nHi, I'm your guest Comptroller Ryan Ridley, and please welcome to the stage the Mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon!\n\n00:37.000 --> 00:43.000\nThank you. Comptroller Ridley, thank you. Pleasure to have you here.\n\n00:43.000 --> 00:45.000\nThank you for having me.\n\n00:45.000 --> 00:55.000\nAlright, thank you for the Sugar Cubes song. We were just talking about the Sugar Cubes. That's why you didn't want me to know what you were playing. It was a surprise.\n\n00:55.000 --> 00:58.000\nIt's very nice. You're a very intimate friend.\n\n00:58.000 --> 01:00.000\nIt's a callback.\n\n01:00.000 --> 01:04.000\nI have high hopes for you tonight. I think you're going to control very well.\n\n01:04.000 --> 01:07.000\nI'm feeling nervous right now, but I appreciate it.\n\n01:07.000 --> 01:10.000\nWhat's the worst thing that you think you might do?\n\n01:10.000 --> 01:14.000\nSay something that I think is going to be funny and that it's not funny.\n\n01:14.000 --> 01:17.000\nWhat's the funniest thing you could think of right now?\n\n01:17.000 --> 01:21.000\nLet's just live through the nightmare.\n\n01:21.000 --> 01:26.000\nWhat's the funniest thing about pickles that you could even think of?\n\n01:26.000 --> 01:30.000\nOh my God. Well, now I have to ad-lib something? Jesus.\n\n01:30.000 --> 01:34.000\nI'll do a reverse improvised knock-knock joke. Who's there?\n\n01:34.000 --> 01:36.000\nKnock-knock!\n\n01:36.000 --> 01:40.000\nWho's there, goddammit? It better be Pickle.\n\n01:40.000 --> 01:43.000\nI've been waiting for a pickle.\n\n01:43.000 --> 01:45.000\nWho's there?\n\n01:45.000 --> 01:48.000\nIt's a stork.\n\n01:48.000 --> 01:50.000\nThe stork from the pickles?\n\n01:50.000 --> 01:52.000\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:52.000 --> 01:56.000\nYeah. Well, why are you here at my door?\n\n01:56.000 --> 02:00.000\nWho are you? Stork who?\n\n02:00.000 --> 02:03.000\nI don't know. Blasic? Mr. Blasic? Is that his name?\n\n02:03.000 --> 02:07.000\nWell, come on in. Come in.\n\n02:07.000 --> 02:08.000\nHow are you?\n\n02:08.000 --> 02:09.000\nI'm great.\n\n02:09.000 --> 02:11.000\nI ordered pickles. I didn't know the stork would come.\n\n02:11.000 --> 02:13.000\nCome on, man.\n\n02:13.000 --> 02:16.000\nSit down. I was just watching The Wire.\n\n02:16.000 --> 02:18.000\nWhat's it about?\n\n02:18.000 --> 02:22.000\nCrime.\n\n02:22.000 --> 02:26.000\nNot pickles or babies. I don't know if that's a stereotype.\n\n02:26.000 --> 02:29.000\nWe sell pickles on corners where I come from.\n\n02:29.000 --> 02:32.000\nYou're familiar with the concept of controlling a corner, owning a corner.\n\n02:32.000 --> 02:35.000\nThese guys do that in The Wire.\n\n02:35.000 --> 02:39.000\nLet's keep watching. Six hours later.\n\n02:39.000 --> 02:44.000\nWhy are they focusing on the stevedores so much this season?\n\n02:44.000 --> 02:48.000\nI miss Stringer Bell.\n\n02:48.000 --> 02:52.000\nI guess they're trying to prove, obviously, the case, which is they're very good writers.\n\n02:52.000 --> 02:55.000\nThey're not drug dealer-dependent.\n\n02:55.000 --> 02:57.000\nFour hours later.\n\n02:57.000 --> 03:03.000\nFucking Stringer Bells back. Yeah. They caved.\n\n03:03.000 --> 03:08.000\nFive hours later. That was a good finale.\n\n03:08.000 --> 03:11.000\nI'm going to try to emulate that for Season 3 of Community.\n\n03:11.000 --> 03:14.000\nA year and a half later. Fuck!\n\n03:14.000 --> 03:16.000\nShit. Fucked it.\n\n03:16.000 --> 03:20.000\nWhy is it trying to emulate The Wire on a sitcom?\n\n03:20.000 --> 03:24.000\nAll right. So I got some bones to pick.\n\n03:24.000 --> 03:26.000\nSee, how did it feel?\n\n03:26.000 --> 03:28.000\nIt was shaking, man.\n\n03:28.000 --> 03:30.000\nBut now you know nothing can harm you.\n\n03:30.000 --> 03:31.000\nListen to these guys.\n\n03:31.000 --> 03:33.000\nYou'll do the heavy lifting.\n\n03:33.000 --> 03:37.000\nI got some bones to pick. Oh, hi, Entie.\n\n03:37.000 --> 03:39.000\nOh, Entie's back.\n\n03:39.000 --> 03:41.000\nWhat? It's Entie's birthday?\n\n03:41.000 --> 03:44.000\nOh, we'll do something special for Entie's birthday.\n\n03:44.000 --> 03:50.000\nI hope you wanted for your birthday me picking pop cultural bones.\n\n03:50.000 --> 03:53.000\nThat's the name of our segment.\n\n03:53.000 --> 03:56.000\nRyan doesn't have an iPad or anything.\n\n03:56.000 --> 03:58.000\nSo there's no...\n\n03:58.000 --> 04:00.000\nI can't improvise jingles. I told you that.\n\n04:00.000 --> 04:03.000\nI want your girlfriend to come and play violin for the segment.\n\n04:03.000 --> 04:05.000\nShe didn't bring her violin.\n\n04:05.000 --> 04:07.000\nRyan's girlfriend's a violinist.\n\n04:07.000 --> 04:09.000\nShe's like an accomplished violinist.\n\n04:09.000 --> 04:12.000\nShe's like, third fourth chair.\n\n04:12.000 --> 04:16.000\nAnd it goes by DEF CON, so that's better than first chair.\n\n04:16.000 --> 04:18.000\nFirst chair violin, you're in trouble.\n\n04:18.000 --> 04:20.000\nIt means war is about to happen.\n\n04:20.000 --> 04:22.000\nYou don't want to be that.\n\n04:22.000 --> 04:24.000\nFourth fourth chair is good.\n\n04:24.000 --> 04:26.000\nThey still call it a fiddle at fourth chair.\n\n04:26.000 --> 04:30.000\nAnd then it becomes slowly you work your way to a violin.\n\n04:30.000 --> 04:34.000\nAnd then you jump forward to the timpani.\n\n04:34.000 --> 04:36.000\nI went to a...\n\n04:36.000 --> 04:38.000\nBen Folds was at the Hollywood Bowl,\n\n04:38.000 --> 04:41.000\nand I was wondering why he works really well with these orchestras and stuff.\n\n04:41.000 --> 04:42.000\nAnd there's this guy...\n\n04:42.000 --> 04:44.000\nI mean, I really want to talk about the...\n\n04:44.000 --> 04:48.000\nYeah, the 30 questions I have for the cymbal guy.\n\n04:48.000 --> 04:50.000\nI was watching him all night, because I was like,\n\n04:50.000 --> 04:56.000\nman, is he... I'm sure your girlfriend could answer these questions.\n\n04:56.000 --> 04:58.000\nShe's right there, by the way.\n\n04:58.000 --> 05:00.000\nYeah, well, I don't like to look at her.\n\n05:02.000 --> 05:05.000\nI'm very uncomfortable around women and musicians,\n\n05:05.000 --> 05:07.000\nso she's double trouble for me.\n\n05:07.000 --> 05:13.000\nBut Mia, are you capable of answering questions in front of a crowd about...\n\n05:13.000 --> 05:15.000\nOkay, okay, no, no.\n\n05:15.000 --> 05:17.000\nAlright, I won't put you in a spot, though.\n\n05:17.000 --> 05:20.000\nBut it's like the guy, he sits in back,\n\n05:20.000 --> 05:22.000\nand then I was just watching him, and he's got that...\n\n05:22.000 --> 05:25.000\nHe sits there in silence for a while, he's reading the music along with it,\n\n05:25.000 --> 05:27.000\nand he's like, yeah, no cymbals on this page.\n\n05:29.000 --> 05:32.000\nAnd then he turns the page, and you can see him start to...\n\n05:32.000 --> 05:34.000\nHe gets up, super professional.\n\n05:34.000 --> 05:37.000\nI mean, he's in the LA Philharmonic, but he just plays the cymbals.\n\n05:37.000 --> 05:39.000\nSo it's like, is he...\n\n05:39.000 --> 05:43.000\nWhen he goes home, is he like a massive drummer?\n\n05:43.000 --> 05:48.000\nAnd he's like, well, fucking the LA Phil is, you know, hard to get into,\n\n05:48.000 --> 05:54.000\nso I'm honored to play just one part of the drum kit for such a prestigious band.\n\n05:54.000 --> 05:58.000\nBut come see me tonight with Fuckface at Space Land.\n\n05:58.000 --> 06:01.000\nAnd I will shred those fucking skins, man.\n\n06:01.000 --> 06:06.000\nAnd he's just sitting there like, I hope my fucking conductor's in the audience.\n\n06:08.000 --> 06:11.000\nAnd then he, like, the night that his conductor comes,\n\n06:11.000 --> 06:13.000\nhe does a whole, like, fucking drum fill.\n\n06:15.000 --> 06:18.000\nAnd then he hovers his stick over a cymbal, and then he drops it.\n\n06:20.000 --> 06:23.000\nAnd he goes like, it's more to it than that mic.\n\n06:25.000 --> 06:28.000\nAnd mic's like, I just conduct, I don't write the fucking...\n\n06:28.000 --> 06:30.000\nWhat do you want, a cymbal symphony?\n\n06:30.000 --> 06:33.000\nYou want me to write like a concerto for a cymbal?\n\n06:33.000 --> 06:34.000\nCymbal?\n\n06:40.000 --> 06:41.000\nIt's the Orbiture.\n\n06:41.000 --> 06:42.000\nAll right.\n\n06:42.000 --> 06:44.000\nThank you for clapping.\n\n06:46.000 --> 06:48.000\nThe president of the Lost Cause Department.\n\n06:49.000 --> 06:52.000\nAll right, so here's my bone I wanted to pick.\n\n06:52.000 --> 06:53.000\nAll right.\n\n06:53.000 --> 06:56.000\nSo I think that enough time has passed now to talk about this,\n\n06:56.000 --> 06:59.000\nand I don't think I'm going to talk about it insensitively.\n\n07:01.000 --> 07:02.000\nUh-oh.\n\n07:02.000 --> 07:03.000\nI don't know what else.\n\n07:08.000 --> 07:10.000\nDon't you think it was a little weird,\n\n07:10.000 --> 07:13.000\nI think thoughtful, but weird,\n\n07:13.000 --> 07:15.000\nwhen Princess Diana died,\n\n07:15.000 --> 07:17.000\nand Elton John just said,\n\n07:17.000 --> 07:19.000\noh, this song's about her too.\n\n07:21.000 --> 07:23.000\nHis Marilyn Monroe song,\n\n07:23.000 --> 07:25.000\nthat's like literally in the song,\n\n07:25.000 --> 07:28.000\nhe's like, your name was Norma Jean,\n\n07:28.000 --> 07:30.000\nand you changed it to Marilyn Monroe,\n\n07:30.000 --> 07:33.000\nand this is a song about you.\n\n07:33.000 --> 07:35.000\nAnd then Princess Diana died,\n\n07:35.000 --> 07:38.000\nand he's like, also Princess Diana,\n\n07:38.000 --> 07:40.000\nyou were also a candle in the wind.\n\n07:40.000 --> 07:42.000\nIt's not, we didn't start the fire.\n\n07:42.000 --> 07:44.000\nThat covers everything.\n\n07:44.000 --> 07:45.000\nYeah, he didn't want that.\n\n07:45.000 --> 07:47.000\nSee, Billy Joel did.\n\n07:47.000 --> 07:49.000\nYeah, he thought ahead.\n\n07:49.000 --> 07:50.000\nYeah.\n\n07:50.000 --> 07:52.000\nBut he probably didn't like Princess Diana.\n\n07:52.000 --> 07:54.000\nHe was probably like, good.\n\n07:55.000 --> 07:57.000\nShe did start the fire.\n\n07:57.000 --> 07:59.000\nI'm just going to add her death to my next song.\n\n07:59.000 --> 08:01.000\nNuclear war and Mario Kart,\n\n08:01.000 --> 08:03.000\nPrincess Diana.\n\n08:06.000 --> 08:07.000\nHe's just like, fucking,\n\n08:07.000 --> 08:09.000\nI'm just going to make some history about me.\n\n08:09.000 --> 08:10.000\nI'm Billy Joel.\n\n08:10.000 --> 08:11.000\nBut Elton John, I don't know,\n\n08:11.000 --> 08:13.000\nwas that a cool move to be like,\n\n08:13.000 --> 08:15.000\nalso, it's also about you.\n\n08:15.000 --> 08:18.000\nAnd also the song itself,\n\n08:18.000 --> 08:21.000\neven when it was just about Marilyn Monroe,\n\n08:21.000 --> 08:23.000\nthis isn't a rhetorical question,\n\n08:23.000 --> 08:26.000\njust like, if I'm wrong, I'm wrong.\n\n08:26.000 --> 08:27.000\nIsn't it kind of a dick move\n\n08:27.000 --> 08:28.000\nto have your whole song be,\n\n08:28.000 --> 08:30.000\nlike, he's like, he's like,\n\n08:30.000 --> 08:32.000\nI didn't know you.\n\n08:32.000 --> 08:34.000\nI was too young.\n\n08:35.000 --> 08:37.000\nYou're old and you're dead.\n\n08:37.000 --> 08:39.000\nAnd then also, like,\n\n08:39.000 --> 08:42.000\nyour candle blew out long before\n\n08:42.000 --> 08:44.000\nyour legend ever did.\n\n08:44.000 --> 08:45.000\nWell, of course it,\n\n08:45.000 --> 08:46.000\nwhat the fuck are you talking about?\n\n08:46.000 --> 08:48.000\nWhy is that even a remarkable thing to say?\n\n08:48.000 --> 08:50.000\nAlso, it's kind of rubbing your face.\n\n08:50.000 --> 08:52.000\nLike, you're a corpse now,\n\n08:52.000 --> 08:54.000\nbut people heard of you.\n\n08:55.000 --> 08:57.000\nWow.\n\n08:57.000 --> 08:58.000\nLike, you have that in common\n\n08:58.000 --> 09:00.000\nwith Attila the Hun.\n\n09:01.000 --> 09:03.000\nI'm sure Marilyn Monroe's zombie\n\n09:03.000 --> 09:04.000\nwould be like, yeah,\n\n09:04.000 --> 09:05.000\nbut I'd rather be alive.\n\n09:05.000 --> 09:08.000\nI'd rather my candle not have burnt out.\n\n09:08.000 --> 09:09.000\nLike, who are you?\n\n09:09.000 --> 09:11.000\nI don't know, I'm too young.\n\n09:11.000 --> 09:13.000\nThe bitch is back.\n\n09:14.000 --> 09:16.000\nHe's not even that young.\n\n09:16.000 --> 09:17.000\nHe's like, I think it was just a song\n\n09:17.000 --> 09:19.000\nabout how he's just like,\n\n09:19.000 --> 09:21.000\nhe's just like, I look how young I was.\n\n09:21.000 --> 09:23.000\nI was just a kid when Marilyn Monroe died.\n\n09:23.000 --> 09:25.000\nDon't brag about that.\n\n09:25.000 --> 09:27.000\nAnd then Princess died, dies,\n\n09:27.000 --> 09:28.000\nand he's like, guess what?\n\n09:28.000 --> 09:30.000\nWrite a new song!\n\n09:30.000 --> 09:32.000\nAlright, obviously you guys disagree,\n\n09:32.000 --> 09:34.000\nor are 25.\n\n09:36.000 --> 09:37.000\nFine.\n\n09:37.000 --> 09:38.000\nI really thought,\n\n09:38.000 --> 09:39.000\nremember when I said I got something juicy\n\n09:39.000 --> 09:40.000\nto talk about?\n\n09:40.000 --> 09:41.000\nI couldn't wait.\n\n09:41.000 --> 09:43.000\nHow sad is it that that was it?\n\n09:45.000 --> 09:46.000\nI'm not going to tell you\n\n09:46.000 --> 09:48.000\nbecause I want your real reactions.\n\n09:48.000 --> 09:49.000\nYou're just sitting there,\n\n09:49.000 --> 09:50.000\nwhich is fine.\n\n09:50.000 --> 09:51.000\nI don't want you to start thinking\n\n09:51.000 --> 09:52.000\nthat you have a job.\n\n09:52.000 --> 09:54.000\nLike, am I supposed to be talking more?\n\n09:54.000 --> 09:55.000\nKeep looking at me.\n\n09:55.000 --> 09:56.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n09:56.000 --> 09:57.000\nShould I?\n\n09:57.000 --> 09:58.000\nJeff, probably?\n\n09:58.000 --> 09:59.000\nNo?\n\n09:59.000 --> 10:00.000\nI got nothing.\n\n10:00.000 --> 10:01.000\nWhat happened?\n\n10:01.000 --> 10:02.000\nDid somebody just vape?\n\n10:02.000 --> 10:04.000\nThere was a puff of smoke that went up.\n\n10:04.000 --> 10:05.000\nMaybe something started on fire.\n\n10:05.000 --> 10:06.000\nSorry.\n\n10:08.000 --> 10:09.000\nOkay, so\n\n10:10.000 --> 10:12.000\nthese are all secondary to that topic.\n\n10:12.000 --> 10:14.000\nThese are all less interesting.\n\n10:14.000 --> 10:16.000\nI think I'm going to like this one better.\n\n10:16.000 --> 10:23.000\nI got picked up from the airport once.\n\n10:28.000 --> 10:30.000\nJeff, be sarcastic.\n\n10:31.000 --> 10:32.000\nI get it.\n\n10:32.000 --> 10:33.000\nYou don't know who Elton John is.\n\n10:33.000 --> 10:35.000\nMaybe you guys should write a song about it.\n\n10:35.000 --> 10:37.000\nGoodbye, Elton John.\n\n10:38.000 --> 10:40.000\nWe were too young to know\n\n10:40.000 --> 10:42.000\nwho you were too young to be singing about\n\n10:42.000 --> 10:44.000\nwhen you sang about being too young\n\n10:44.000 --> 10:46.000\nto know somebody that died.\n\n10:46.000 --> 10:48.000\nIt seems to me you lived your life\n\n10:48.000 --> 10:51.000\nmaking one song about multiple people,\n\n10:51.000 --> 10:53.000\nnever knowing which dead person\n\n10:53.000 --> 10:56.000\nto ride the coattails of.\n\n10:56.000 --> 10:59.000\nI would have liked to be mad about it,\n\n10:59.000 --> 11:02.000\nbut I was just a kid when you were irrelevant.\n\n11:05.000 --> 11:07.000\nThat song was already annoying\n\n11:07.000 --> 11:09.000\nbefore everyone else died\n\n11:09.000 --> 11:10.000\nthat you made it about.\n\n11:10.000 --> 11:11.000\nAll right.\n\n11:11.000 --> 11:13.000\nSo I got picked up from the airport\n\n11:13.000 --> 11:18.000\nand I always ask a driver,\n\n11:18.000 --> 11:20.000\nso I like to make small talk,\n\n11:20.000 --> 11:22.000\nand I know what the drivers like to talk about.\n\n11:22.000 --> 11:23.000\nI always ask them,\n\n11:23.000 --> 11:25.000\nwho's the most famous person?\n\n11:25.000 --> 11:26.000\nOr just name it.\n\n11:26.000 --> 11:28.000\nLike, who's not even the most famous person?\n\n11:28.000 --> 11:30.000\nJust tell me something that's stuck out\n\n11:30.000 --> 11:31.000\nthat drove in your car.\n\n11:31.000 --> 11:33.000\nYou know, it's like a car guy.\n\n11:33.000 --> 11:35.000\nYou know, they drive people.\n\n11:35.000 --> 11:36.000\nThey're in LA.\n\n11:36.000 --> 11:37.000\nDefinitely.\n\n11:37.000 --> 11:38.000\nSometimes you hear,\n\n11:38.000 --> 11:40.000\noh, Alan Aldo was a really nice guy.\n\n11:40.000 --> 11:42.000\nBruce Willis was mean to me or something like that.\n\n11:42.000 --> 11:43.000\nIt's kind of fun.\n\n11:43.000 --> 11:44.000\nThis guy said,\n\n11:44.000 --> 11:45.000\nhe said, well,\n\n11:45.000 --> 11:48.000\nI picked up a guy named D.L. Hughley.\n\n11:48.000 --> 11:49.000\nYou know him,\n\n11:49.000 --> 11:51.000\nand I said, I've heard of D.L. Hughley.\n\n11:51.000 --> 11:52.000\nI know who that is.\n\n11:52.000 --> 11:54.000\nAnd he said, yeah,\n\n11:54.000 --> 11:56.000\nhe wanted the red door service.\n\n11:56.000 --> 11:57.000\nUh-oh.\n\n11:57.000 --> 11:58.000\nAnd I was like,\n\n11:58.000 --> 12:00.000\nwhat's red door service?\n\n12:00.000 --> 12:01.000\nHe's like, you know,\n\n12:01.000 --> 12:04.000\nthere's a, if you're famous,\n\n12:04.000 --> 12:07.000\nthere's a red door at LAX\n\n12:07.000 --> 12:09.000\nyou can be taken to.\n\n12:09.000 --> 12:11.000\nIt's like a VIP door?\n\n12:11.000 --> 12:13.000\nI guess that's why you never see Harrison Ford\n\n12:13.000 --> 12:15.000\nlike getting frisked at the airport.\n\n12:15.000 --> 12:17.000\nHe doesn't just have a private jet.\n\n12:17.000 --> 12:19.000\nI saw Frank Langella once.\n\n12:19.000 --> 12:20.000\nYeah.\n\n12:20.000 --> 12:22.000\nHe's like purple door.\n\n12:22.000 --> 12:25.000\nUh, but, but like,\n\n12:25.000 --> 12:26.000\nI guess there's a red door.\n\n12:26.000 --> 12:27.000\nI don't know.\n\n12:27.000 --> 12:29.000\nDid he tell you more about it?\n\n12:29.000 --> 12:31.000\nWhat does it look like?\n\n12:31.000 --> 12:32.000\nHe said, I pulled him up to a thing\n\n12:32.000 --> 12:34.000\nand it was like a red door.\n\n12:34.000 --> 12:35.000\nIt was red?\n\n12:35.000 --> 12:36.000\nYes.\n\n12:36.000 --> 12:37.000\nHe said,\n\n12:37.000 --> 12:38.000\nI pulled him up to a thing\n\n12:38.000 --> 12:40.000\nand it was like a red door.\n\n12:40.000 --> 12:41.000\nYes.\n\n12:41.000 --> 12:42.000\nThat part.\n\n12:42.000 --> 12:43.000\nOkay.\n\n12:43.000 --> 12:44.000\nI don't remember that part of the conversation.\n\n12:44.000 --> 12:45.000\nI just

13:43.000\nAnd there were balloons.\n\n13:43.000 --> 13:45.000\nWe got a tank of helium.\n\n13:45.000 --> 13:46.000\nOh.\n\n13:46.000 --> 13:48.000\nAnd I said,\n\n13:48.000 --> 13:49.000\nI can see where this is going.\n\n13:49.000 --> 13:50.000\nAnd I saw,\n\n13:50.000 --> 13:51.000\nand I saw this big helium tank.\n\n13:51.000 --> 13:54.000\nIt looks exactly like a propane tank.\n\n13:54.000 --> 13:55.000\nAnd I,\n\n13:55.000 --> 13:56.000\nand Aaron was like,\n\n13:56.000 --> 13:57.000\ncan you put that over there?\n\n13:57.000 --> 13:58.000\nAnd I was like,\n\n13:58.000 -->

up.\n\n14:03.000 --> 14:05.000\nTanks of helium are very light.\n\n14:05.000 --> 14:09.000\nIt's like a metal tank\n\n14:09.000 --> 14:12.000\nfilled with something lighter than air.\n\n14:12.000 --> 14:13.000\nAnd I was like,\n\n14:13.000 --> 14:16.000\nI was so overjoyed by that.\n\n14:16.000 --> 14:17.000\nThis is like a joke.\n\n14:17.000 --> 14:18.000\nIt's like a cartoon.\n\n14:18.000 --> 14:19.000\nLike the tank,\n\n14:19.000 --> 14:20.000\nthe tank is light.\n\n14:20.000 --> 14:22.000\nDoes it technically make it lighter than the tank\n\n14:22.000 --> 14:23.000\nif it was empty?\n\n14:23.000 --> 14:24.000\nYour name?\n\n14:24.000 --> 14:25.000\nI would think so.\n\n14:25.000 --> 14:26.000\nCause it's,\n\n14:26.000 --> 14:27.000\nit's lighter than air.\n\n14:27.000 --> 14:28.000\nThat's why balloons float.\n\n14:28.000 --> 14:29.000\nYeah.\n\n14:29.000 --> 14:30.000\nIt's lighter than air.\n\n14:30.000 --> 14:31.000\nRight.\n\n14:31.000 --> 14:32.000\nIf you put enough helium into,\n\n14:32.000 --> 14:34.000\nI guess a thin enough tank.\n\n14:34.000 --> 14:38.000\nYou could fly.\n\n14:38.000 --> 14:39.000\nIt's,\n\n14:39.000 --> 14:40.000\nit's a dirigible, right?\n\n14:40.000 --> 14:41.000\nIt's a,\n\n14:41.000 --> 14:42.000\nyeah.\n\n14:42.000 --> 14:44.000\nI don't,\n\n14:44.000 --> 14:47.000\ntanks of helium are lighter.\n\n14:47.000 --> 14:48.000\nYou guys should have,\n\n14:48.000 --> 14:49.000\nyou guys should have been more into the candle.\n\n14:49.000 --> 14:52.000\nWhat's in a blimp?\n\n14:52.000 --> 14:54.000\nI could have

the Jewish part so much.\n\n17:07.000 --> 17:08.000\nRight.\n\n17:08.000 --> 17:09.000\nBecause Irish competes with that identity.\n\n17:09.000 --> 17:10.000\nRight.\n\n17:10.000 --> 17:11.000\nIt kind of evens you out.\n\n17:11.000 --> 17:12.000\nYeah.\n\n17:12.000 --> 17:13.000\nI'm nothing.\n\n17:13.000 --> 17:15.000\nI'm like a bunch of random other European.\n\n17:15.000 -->

17:43.000\nLike,\n\n17:43.000 --> 17:44.000\nI had this idea.\n\n17:44.000 --> 17:46.000\nWell, it sounds like I don't have to do anything.\n\n17:46.000 --> 17:47.000\nRyan is,\n\n17:47.000 --> 17:49.000\nRyan is half Jewish, half Irish.\n\n17:49.000 --> 17:50.000\nI could,\n\n17:50.000 --> 17:52.000\nto the extent that that's true,\n\n17:52.000 --> 17:54.000\nI'm fully Irish.\n\n17:54.000

probably the thing of the past.\n\n28:06.000 --> 28:08.000\nMost of us got in a fight\n\n28:08.000 --> 28:09.000\nwith someone on prom night.\n\n28:09.000 --> 28:12.000\nBut there's not enough of the...\n\n28:12.000 --> 28:14.000\nNot enough of the...\n\n28:14.000 --> 28:16.000\nAs if Bar Mitzvah these days are so pure.\n\n28:16.000 --> 28:18.000\nThe Bar Mitzvah ritualistic.\n\n28:18.000 --> 28:19.000\nWell, that's another topic, though.\n\n28:19.000 --> 28:21.000\nIt's like this secularization\n\n28:21.000 --> 28:25.000\nof the theology and Judaism\n\n28:25.000 --> 28:28.000\nhasn't made it less functional.\n\n28:28.000 --> 28:30.000\nThat's what I like.\n\n28:30.000 --> 28:33.000\nAs a Jewophile, whatever the word is,\n\n28:33.000 --> 28:36.000\nI'm always jealous of the fact that it's like,\n\n28:36.000 --> 28:38.000\nyeah, they figured it out.\n\n28:38.000 --> 28:41.000\nThey got a religion where they believe in an entity\n\n28:41.000 --> 28:43.000\nthat they can have one foot in, one foot out.\n\n28:43.000 --> 28:45.000\nThey can get their shit done.\n\n28:45.000 --> 28:47.000\nThe focus is on community and family.\n\n28:47.000 --> 28:50.000\nIt's not based on this McDonald's like,\n\n28:50.000 --> 28:52.000\nhey, fucking, whose city wants one?\n\n28:52.000 --> 28:53.000\nYou can have one.\n\n28:53.000 --> 28:54.000\nHere's your Big Mac maker.\n\n28:54.000 --> 28:55.000\nWhat?\n\n28:55.000 --> 28:56.000\nThe health department closed you down?\n\n28:56.000 --> 28:58.000\nWe don't know you.\n\n29:00.000 --> 29:02.000\nThere's no Vatican and Judaism.\n\n29:02.000 --> 29:04.000\nThere's no like, it's not like Subway.\n\n29:04.000 --> 29:06.000\nIt's not like this is like...\n\n29:06.000 --> 29:08.000\nSubway is also a great company.\n\n29:12.000 --> 29:14.000\nThat being able to shoot outdoors in season six\n\n29:14.000 --> 29:16.000\nmay be totally reliant on,\n\n29:16.000 --> 29:19.000\nso I didn't mean to connect those dots.\n\n29:20.000 --> 29:23.000\nSubway actually, I think Subway would probably say...\n\n29:23.000 --> 29:25.000\nThey wouldn't say this, but...\n\n29:25.000 --> 29:28.000\nOff record, they might say,\n\n29:28.000 --> 29:30.000\nno, we function more like Judaism than Christianity\n\n29:30.000 --> 29:33.000\nbecause I think the reason why Subway is able to be so game\n\n29:33.000 --> 29:35.000\nis that they actually are...\n\n29:35.000 --> 29:38.000\nThey're like a disbanded group of franchises.\n\n29:38.000 --> 29:42.000\nThere isn't like a central capital where it's like,\n\n29:42.000 --> 29:44.000\nI'm Mr. Subway and I'm angry.\n\n29:44.000 --> 29:46.000\nI want to take over the world.\n\n29:46.000 --> 29:48.000\nWho's not helping me?\n\n29:50.000 --> 29:52.000\nSubway is more Jewish than Christian.\n\n29:52.000 --> 29:57.000\nIf there's 12 Subway employees in one place,\n\n29:57.000 --> 29:59.000\nthat's a minion.\n\n29:59.000 --> 30:01.000\nYou can make new rules for Subway.\n\n30:02.000 --> 30:04.000\nI think that's really cool.\n\n30:04.000 --> 30:06.000\nAnd you know, if you bring a baby into Subway,\n\n30:06.000 --> 30:08.000\nthey will cut his little wiener\n\n30:08.000 --> 30:10.000\nand suck the blood with their mouths.\n\n30:12.000 --> 30:14.000\nThey might. They might.\n\n30:15.000 --> 30:17.000\nIs community like the cool Christian church\n\n30:17.000 --> 30:19.000\nthat plays guitar?\n\n30:19.000 --> 30:21.000\nSubway's cool.\n\n30:21.000 --> 30:23.000\nYeah, we get it.\n\n30:24.000 --> 30:26.000\nThe pastor that only sits backwards in his chair,\n\n30:26.000 --> 30:29.000\nlike, guys, let me rap to you about a friend of mine named JC.\n\n30:32.000 --> 30:35.000\nYeah, like, well, I guess that's the thing\n\n30:35.000 --> 30:37.000\nJudaism and Christianity have in common.\n\n30:37.000 --> 30:39.000\nThey always bury the lead.\n\n30:40.000 --> 30:42.000\nNo one can be genuinely proud\n\n30:42.000 --> 30:44.000\nlike those Christian shows for kids that are like,\n\n30:44.000 --> 30:47.000\nlike, listen, this show is called How to Rock.\n\n30:47.000 --> 30:51.000\nFor Jesus.\n\n30:51.000 --> 30:54.000\nHow to get your parents to do whatever you want.\n\n30:54.000 --> 30:56.000\nWell, I'm going to tell you,\n\n30:56.000 --> 30:59.000\nI know the guy who wrote the book on being radical.\n\n30:59.000 --> 31:01.000\nIt's Jesus.\n\n31:02.000 --> 31:04.000\nLike, they draw you in.\n\n31:04.000 --> 31:08.000\nThat's like 20 minutes into a 40-minute Kirk Cameron tape\n\n31:08.000 --> 31:10.000\nyou're watching.\n\n31:10.000 --> 31:12.000\nIt's just called Super Dude.\n\n31:12.000 --> 31:14.000\nAnd it's just like 20 minutes in.\n\n31:14.000 --> 31:17.000\nAnd then at least he asks 113 and says, oh, man.\n\n31:18.000 --> 31:20.000\nYeah, these girls came up to me at a mall\n\n31:20.000 --> 31:22.000\nwhen I was like 16 and I'm like, hey,\n\n31:22.000 --> 31:24.000\nyou want to go to a party?\n\n31:24.000 --> 31:26.000\nAnd I'm like, do I?\n\n31:26.000 --> 31:28.000\nTurns out it was church.\n\n31:28.000 --> 31:30.000\nThat was the big thing in my neighborhood,\n\n31:30.000 --> 31:32.000\nBrown Deer, Wisconsin.\n\n31:32.000 --> 31:34.000\nIt was the lock-ins.\n\n31:34.000 --> 31:36.000\nWe're having a lock-in.\n\n31:36.000 --> 31:38.000\nLike the cutest girls in high school.\n\n31:38.000 --> 31:40.000\nThere's going to be a lock-in.\n\n31:40.000 --> 31:43.000\nThey didn't know that they were advertising this thing.\n\n31:43.000 --> 31:45.000\nIt was just a natural, organic thing that was happening.\n\n31:45.000 --> 31:48.000\nIt was like some studly dude with a guitar and long hair\n\n31:48.000 --> 31:50.000\nwho then, like, all the girls have crushes on him.\n\n31:50.000 --> 31:53.000\nHe sends them out like, why don't you guys go tell all your friends?\n\n31:53.000 --> 31:56.000\nLike, let's fucking, let's just hang out tomorrow.\n\n31:56.000 --> 32:00.000\nWe've got to lock the doors, you know, just because.\n\n32:02.000 --> 32:04.000\nNot because anyone's going to want to leave\n\n32:04.000 --> 32:06.000\nonce I reveal why we're actually there.\n\n32:07.000 --> 32:11.000\nIt's just so that non-rocking people can't get in\n\n32:11.000 --> 32:13.000\nafter midnight.\n\n32:13.000 --> 32:14.000\nThis is high school?\n\n32:14.000 --> 32:15.000\nYeah.\n\n32:15.000 --> 32:17.000\nJust like kids who went to school with their kids in the town?\n\n32:17.000 --> 32:18.000\nYeah.\n\n32:18.000 --> 32:20.000\nIt's a small Midwestern town, so there was a, you know,\n\n32:20.000 --> 32:22.000\nthere was a lot of people that loved them some Jesus.\n\n32:22.000 --> 32:24.000\nIt's such a culty vibe.\n\n32:24.000 --> 32:26.000\nIt was always, I mean, there was just church youth groups\n\n32:26.000 --> 32:27.000\nthere everywhere.\n\n32:27.000 --> 32:29.000\nI mean, that's like, like, there's, I'm sure by applause,\n\n32:29.000 --> 32:31.000\nhow many people went through a,\n\n32:31.000 --> 32:34.000\nthrough a small Christian phase in their teenage years.\n\n32:34.000 --> 32:36.000\nLike, you don't know, see?\n\n32:36.000 --> 32:37.000\nWhoa.\n\n32:37.000 --> 32:38.000\nIt's our shul.\n\n32:38.000 --> 32:40.000\nIt's our, it's our Israel.\n\n32:40.000 --> 32:42.000\nIs anyone going through a Christian phase now?\n\n32:47.000 --> 32:49.000\nIt's cool to do when you're an adult.\n\n32:49.000 --> 32:50.000\nWait, I want to try one.\n\n32:50.000 --> 32:53.000\nHas anyone been to a bar mitzvah where they had blow-up\n\n32:53.000 --> 32:55.000\ninflatable saxophones?\n\n32:55.000 --> 32:57.000\nYeah!\n\n32:58.000 --> 33:01.000\nInflatable saxophones is my religion.\n\n33:03.000 --> 33:05.000\nHow many Jews are in the audience?\n\n33:06.000 --> 33:08.000\nIs your mother Jewish?\n\n33:08.000 --> 33:10.000\nOh!\n\n33:10.000 --> 33:12.000\nMore people clap that time than the,\n\n33:12.000 --> 33:13.000\nWho's Jewish?\n\n33:13.000 --> 33:14.000\nYeah.\n\n33:14.000 --> 33:16.000\nSee, you explained to me the reason for the mother rule\n\n33:16.000 --> 33:20.000\nis of course because there, before paternity tests,\n\n33:20.000 --> 33:24.000\nbefore modern society, if you had to know,\n\n33:24.000 --> 33:27.000\nthe only way you could know for sure who,\n\n33:27.000 --> 33:30.000\nwhere you came from was the mother side.\n\n33:30.000 --> 33:32.000\nThat was like rate-proofing it, right?\n\n33:32.000 --> 33:33.000\nThat's what somebody told me.\n\n33:33.000 --> 33:34.000\nYeah.\n\n33:34.000 --> 33:36.000\nBecause there's a lot of Roman soldiers.\n\n33:36.000 --> 33:38.000\nIf you go by paternal lineage,\n\n33:38.000 --> 33:40.000\nyou can start to fudge the books,\n\n33:40.000 --> 33:42.000\nbut it's hard to fake a birth.\n\n33:44.000 --> 33:46.000\nSo, Jewishness goes by the mother's side.\n\n33:46.000 --> 33:48.000\nIf you're half Jewish on your mom's side,\n\n33:48.000 --> 33:49.000\nyou're allowed to just go,\n\n33:49.000 --> 33:50.000\nI'm totes Jewish.\n\n33:50.000 --> 33:51.000\nYeah.\n\n33:51.000 --> 33:54.000\nSorry about my dad getting in there,\n\n33:54.000 --> 33:56.000\nbut it won't happen again.\n\n33:56.000 --> 33:58.000\nI will carry this torch.\n\n34:00.000 --> 34:02.000\nI will go on J-Day and I will...\n\n34:02.000 --> 34:04.000\nThe Jewish mother versus Jewish father\n\n34:04.000 --> 34:06.000\ncreates a real school-day schism\n\n34:06.000 --> 34:08.000\namongst the half Jews, yeah.\n\n34:08.000 --> 34:10.000\nYeah, she knows what I'm talking about.\n\n34:10.000 --> 34:11.000\nThat's true.\n\n34:11.000 --> 34:12.000\nWait, what do you mean?\n\n34:12.000 --> 34:13.000\nSpike Lee's school days.\n\n34:13.000 --> 34:15.000\nNo, we know that.\n\n34:15.000 --> 34:16.000\nLet me explain something.\n\n34:16.000 --> 34:18.000\nIt's a movie that's Spike Lee.\n\n34:18.000 --> 34:20.000\nWhat's the controversy?\n\n34:20.000 --> 34:22.000\nShe knows what I'm talking about.\n\n34:22.000 --> 34:24.000\nWell, why do you put it off on her?\n\n34:24.000 --> 34:25.000\nYeah, you're right.\n\n34:25.000 --> 34:27.000\nI guess I know one of the mic.\n\n34:29.000 --> 34:31.000\nThe half Jews whose mother are Jewish\n\n34:31.000 --> 34:34.000\nkind of has like, well, I'm the real Jew.\n\n34:34.000 --> 34:35.000\nYou're not.\n\n34:35.000 --> 34:37.000\nYou're just a half Jew, biologically.\n\n34:37.000 --> 34:38.000\nI'm not saying it's good.\n\n34:38.000 --> 34:40.000\nYou're saying there are Jews\n\n34:40.000 --> 34:42.000\nwho are born on their mom's side, half Jews.\n\n34:42.000 --> 34:43.000\nYeah.\n\n34:43.000 --> 34:44.000\nOh, so it's like...\n\n34:44.000 --> 34:46.000\nLook down their nose at the ones whose dad is Jewish.\n\n34:46.000 --> 34:48.000\nLook down their prodigious noses.\n\n34:50.000 --> 34:51.000\nListen, don't take this lightly.\n\n34:51.000 --> 34:53.000\nI'm going to look down my nose.\n\n34:53.000 --> 34:56.000\nIt's taking me a long time to look down this nose,\n\n34:56.000 --> 34:59.000\nso know that I mean it when I say it.\n\n34:59.000 --> 35:01.000\nMotherfucker.\n\n35:05.000 --> 35:06.000\nYeah, man.\n\n35:06.000 --> 35:09.000\nDave Horowitz was looking down his nose at me the other day.\n\n35:09.000 --> 35:10.000\nIt took forever.\n\n35:10.000 --> 35:12.000\nIt was exhausting.\n\n35:12.000 --> 35:15.000\nHe had to take a break halfway through\n\n35:15.000 --> 35:17.000\nwith a glass of water.\n\n35:20.000 --> 35:21.000\nThat nose thing.\n\n35:21.000 --> 35:25.000\nI guess I've seen the nose thing.\n\n35:25.000 --> 35:26.000\nYeah, you're looking at it.\n\n35:26.000 --> 35:28.000\nYou don't have a big nose.\n\n35:28.000 --> 35:29.000\nNo, you don't.\n\n35:29.000 --> 35:30.000\nNot at all.\n\n35:30.000 --> 35:31.000\nNot even close.\n\n35:31.000 --> 35:33.000\nYou have Eugene Levy eyebrows.\n\n35:33.000 --> 35:34.000\nYou don't have...\n\n35:34.000 --> 35:37.000\nBut like we agreed, the cooler version.\n\n35:37.000 --> 35:38.000\nThe cooler version.\n\n35:38.000 --> 35:39.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n35:39.000 --> 35:40.000\nNo, the hips.\n\n35:40.000 --> 35:41.000\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n35:41.000 --> 35:43.000\nBut that's crazy.\n\n35:43.000 --> 35:47.000\nYou have body dysmorphia if you think your nose is unusual.\n\n35:47.000 --> 35:50.000\nI'm just saying that Eugene Levy I am would want you to call him Gene.\n\n35:52.000 --> 35:53.000\nThat's all.\n\n35:53.000 --> 35:54.000\nThat's all.\n\n35:54.000 --> 35:59.000\nMaybe it's my, I have like, you know, kind of face blindness, self-diagnosed aloofness.\n\n35:59.000 --> 36:02.000\nSo maybe I just don't see noses.\n\n36:03.000 --> 36:05.000\nHow can you miss it?\n\n36:05.000 --> 36:13.000\nI embarrassingly was unaware of what a minority I was in as a Jew,\n\n36:13.000 --> 36:15.000\nbecause like the tenant grew up in a small and it was,\n\n36:15.000 --> 36:20.000\nat this point, like 74% Jewish, more temples and churches.\n\n36:20.000 --> 36:27.000\nAnd I got to school and like college and nobody, like everyone I talked to was like,\n\n36:27.000 --> 36:30.000\nyou're like, and they would, they thought for a half a second,\n\n36:30.000 --> 36:33.000\nlike you're like the third Jewish person.\n\n36:33.000 --> 36:34.000\nNo, no, no, hold on.\n\n36:34.000 --> 36:35.000\nThat guy, what's the second?\n\n36:35.000 --> 36:36.000\nI think you're the second Jewish person I've ever talked to.\n\n36:36.000 --> 36:38.000\nAnd I couldn't believe it.\n\n36:38.000 --> 36:41.000\nAnd, and I experienced such like mild antisemitism,\n\n36:41.000 --> 36:45.000\nbecause it would just be like a kid on my floor who was super drunk would be like,\n\n36:45.000 --> 36:47.000\nso you're Jewish?\n\n36:47.000 --> 36:52.000\nI'm like, uh-huh. So like you don't, like Christmas is like not.\n\n36:52.000 --> 36:57.000\nLike it's like, do you don't do, I'm like, no, we don't, I don't,\n\n36:57.000 --> 36:58.000\nmy family doesn't do it.\n\n36:58.000 --> 37:01.000\nAnd he's like, oh, that fucking sucks.\n\n37:01.000 --> 37:04.000\nYeah, they're just like, well, because they grew up in the same,\n\n37:04.000 --> 37:07.000\nsame scenario you did except the other way around.\n\n37:07.000 --> 37:09.000\nI was like, I don't know,\n\n37:09.000 --> 37:11.000\nI guess there might have been some Jewish kids around.\n\n37:11.000 --> 37:12.000\nI was just like, it wasn't introduced.\n\n37:12.000 --> 37:16.000\nI wasn't indoctrinated into it until like it slowly trickles into your awareness.\n\n37:16.000 --> 37:19.000\nCause you're just talking about a bunch of white people.\n\n37:19.000 --> 37:23.000\nLike it's, it's a lot easier to get indoctrinated into racism on the,\n\n37:23.000 --> 37:25.000\non the grade school playground.\n\n37:25.000 --> 37:29.000\nAnd then, and then, and then it's more of a like high school college thing.\n\n37:29.000 --> 37:32.000\nLike you slowly hear this weird word that doesn't mean anything.\n\n37:32.000 --> 37:35.000\nAnd then you, and then you go to college and you meet someone that,\n\n37:35.000 --> 37:36.000\nand you go like, okay.\n\n37:36.000 --> 37:37.000\nSo what's that?\n\n37:37.000 --> 37:40.000\nAnd you ask him a bunch of weird questions the way that you might ask a black person,\n\n37:40.000 --> 37:41.000\nweird questions.\n\n37:41.000 --> 37:44.000\nIf you hadn't been, if you didn't grow up around them,\n\n37:44.000 --> 37:47.000\nyou would, which would be mildly racist because of your strange,\n\n37:47.000 --> 37:52.000\nmisdirected like seeking of truth and the well-rounded.\n\n37:52.000 --> 37:54.000\nBut then, and then also you just observe like,\n\n37:54.000 --> 37:59.000\nOh, not everyone's last name ends in like wits or Stein or like a gold or Berg.\n\n37:59.000 --> 38:00.000\nThere's a lot of shit to get straight.\n\n38:00.000 --> 38:03.000\nI mean, a lot more Smiths outside of Sharon, Massachusetts.\n\n38:03.000 --> 38:05.000\nA lot more.\n\n38:05.000 --> 38:07.000\nAh, Jews.\n\n38:07.000 --> 38:08.000\nAll right.\n\n38:08.000 --> 38:09.000\nHey, Dan.\n\n38:09.000 --> 38:10.000\nYeah.\n\n38:10.000 --> 38:11.000\nCan I have some more vodka?\n\n38:11.000 --> 38:13.000\nYeah.\n\n38:13.000 --> 38:18.000\nI mean, I don't usually serve it, but you're doing great.\n\n38:18.000 --> 38:19.000\nWay to go, Ryan.\n\n38:19.000 --> 38:20.000\nRyan Ridley.\n\n38:20.000 --> 38:28.000\nHey, Auntie.\n\n38:28.000 --> 38:35.000\nThis one's for, this one's for Auntie's birthday.\n\n38:35.000 --> 38:40.000\nAuntie's been moonlighting at other podcasts.\n\n38:40.000 --> 38:42.000\nBut we're always happy to see them.\n\n38:42.000 --> 38:43.000\nAll right.\n\n38:43.000 --> 38:44.000\nSo.\n\n38:44.000 --> 38:45.000\nWhat's up?\n\n38:45.000 --> 38:46.000\nWhat's up?\n\n38:46.000 --> 38:47.000\nWhat else you got?\n\n38:47.000 --> 38:51.000\nI want to bring out, I want to bring out my, uh, uh, my rabbi friend, Spencer Crittenden\n\n38:51.000 --> 38:52.000\nDay.\n\n38:52.000 --> 38:53.000\nYeah.\n\n38:53.000 --> 38:54.000\nYeah.\n\n38:54.000 --> 38:55.000\nAll right.\n\n38:55.000 --> 38:56.000\nI know.\n\n38:56.000 --> 38:57.000\nI could write my first high five.\n\n38:57.000 --> 38:58.000\nThat was a really good high five.\n\n38:58.000 --> 38:59.000\nThe weirdest.\n\n38:59.000 --> 39:00.000\nI didn't get a high five.\n\n39:00.000 --> 39:11.000\nI was about to say, you know, who didn't get a high five.\n\n39:11.000 --> 39:12.000\nRyan Ridley.\n\n39:12.000 --> 39:13.000\nAll right.\n\n39:13.000 --> 39:17.000\nA lot of backstory to Spencer and I's relationship.\n\n39:17.000 --> 39:21.000\nIt's a very complex and storied history.\n\n39:21.000 --> 39:23.000\nIt'll come through.\n\n39:23.000 --> 39:25.000\nIt'll, it'll, it'll shine.\n\n39:25.000 --> 39:27.000\nIt always shines through.\n\n39:27.000 --> 39:28.000\nIt always shines through.\n\n39:28.000 --> 39:30.000\nDo you have something you want to say, Spencer?\n\n39:30.000 --> 39:34.000\nI have so many things that I want to say right now.\n\n39:34.000 --> 39:35.000\nAll right.\n\n39:35.000 --> 39:36.000\nSay, say one of them.\n\n39:36.000 --> 39:37.000\nOkay.\n\n39:37.000 --> 39:42.000\nWhat was all this you were saying about helium Dan, because I had some issues.\n\n39:42.000 --> 39:43.000\nIt's, it's lighter than air.\n\n39:43.000 --> 39:44.000\nIt sure is.\n\n39:44.000 --> 39:46.000\nAnd then, so the tank is lighter.\n\n39:46.000 --> 39:52.000\nIt is lighter than if you had a tank equally sized of us, say, you know, like, uh, air.\n\n39:52.000 --> 39:53.000\nNothing.\n\n39:53.000 --> 39:54.000\nPropane.\n\n39:54.000 --> 39:55.000\nYeah.\n\n39:55.000 --> 39:56.000\nOr air.\n\n39:56.000 --> 39:59.000\nIt's still not, you know, it's not, it's not lighter than air on its own.\n\n39:59.000 --> 40:01.000\nIt's just, it's, it's pressurized.\n\n40:01.000 --> 40:03.000\nSo it's, it's denser than air.\n\n40:03.000 --> 40:06.000\nBut even pressurized, it's lighter than pressurized air.\n\n40:06.000 --> 40:09.000\nIt's lighter than, uh, equally pressurized area.\n\n40:09.000 --> 40:15.000\nSo, so, so, so looking at a tank of helium that looked like a similar tank of propane,\n\n40:15.000 --> 40:21.000\nI was like, the reason why I was amazed as I lifted it up is because of what was inside it.\n\n40:21.000 --> 40:22.000\nHelium.\n\n40:22.000 --> 40:23.000\nYeah.\n\n40:23.000 --> 40:24.000\nAll right.\n\n40:24.000 --> 40:27.000\nWell, I guess I don't have any issues then.\n\n40:27.000 --> 40:30.000\nIt just sounds like you're saying, oh, it's floating away.\n\n40:30.000 --> 40:31.000\nIt's this helium.\n\n40:31.000 --> 40:33.000\nNo, no, I mean, I don't, it's possible.\n\n40:33.000 --> 40:35.000\nThey got to get that shit in blimps.\n\n40:35.000 --> 40:41.000\nIt's possible that the same way they dye cheddar cheese orange, like, because otherwise you wouldn't think it was cheese.\n\n40:41.000 --> 40:45.000\nUm, they, they might make helium tanks lighter material.\n\n40:45.000 --> 40:48.000\nSo that you're like, like, so that people are shopping for helium.\n\n40:48.000 --> 40:51.000\nThey're like, oh, fuck this brand of helium.\n\n40:51.000 --> 40:55.000\nThat tank's fucking like, like, like, like, you can barely lift it, Martha.\n\n40:55.000 --> 40:56.000\nOh, look at this.\n\n40:56.000 --> 40:57.000\nThis is the light stuff.\n\n40:57.000 --> 40:59.000\nThis is a good one.\n\n40:59.000 --> 41:01.000\nThat's a good tank.\n\n41:01.000 --> 41:06.000\nNow, what's weird about the cheese thing you were talking about is they get you on both sides with the cheese.\n\n41:06.000 --> 41:07.000\nThey dye it orange.\n\n41:07.000 --> 41:08.000\nThey're like, oh, this is cheese.\n\n41:08.000 --> 41:10.000\nThis is what cheese looks like orange.\n\n41:10.000 --> 41:12.000\nAnd then they come back with you on the backside.\n\n41:12.000 --> 41:15.000\nHow about this fine aged white cheddar?\n\n41:15.000 --> 41:16.000\nYeah.\n\n41:16.000 --> 41:19.000\nIt's just the same cheese without fucking dye in it.\n\n41:19.000 --> 41:20.000\nAnd they say it's better.\n\n41:20.000 --> 41:21.000\nYeah.\n\n41:21.000 --> 41:23.000\nBut then they say it's good cheese because it has dye in it.\n\n41:23.000 --> 41:26.000\nI'm upset about cheese.\n\n41:26.000 --> 41:29.000\nI think you should be.\n\n41:29.000 --> 41:31.000\nIt's not better things.\n\n41:31.000 --> 41:35.000\nIt's the best thing I've been upset about in a while, I gotta say.\n\n41:35.000 --> 41:39.000\nSpencer, I think that, and I only say this because I'm a cheddar enthusiast,\n\n41:39.000 --> 41:43.000\nand I'm not trying to step on anything you're saying, but thank you.\n\n41:43.000 --> 41:47.000\nI think that maybe when it's extra sharp or sharp, it tends to be white,\n\n41:47.000 --> 41:51.000\nand then regular levels of sharpness, that's the orange.\n\n41:51.000 --> 41:53.000\nSo maybe that's how they're distinguishing it.\n\n41:53.000 --> 41:55.000\nYou know, outside of Tillamook, I don't know what to say,\n\n41:55.000 --> 42:00.000\nbut a lot of cheeses are very sharp as well as orange.\n\n42:00.000 --> 42:02.000\nSo I mean, I don't know.\n\n42:02.000 --> 42:05.000\nThis is a great argument to have, I think.\n\n42:05.000 --> 42:07.000\nI don't know if it counts as an argument.\n\n42:07.000 --> 42:09.000\nI'm arguing. I think it does.\n\n42:09.000 --> 42:11.000\nNow it definitely is.\n\n42:11.000 --> 42:14.000\nWell, I agree with you, so now it's not an argument.\n\n42:14.000 --> 42:16.000\nWell, I disagree.\n\n42:16.000 --> 42:18.000\nYou disagree with me agreeing with you.\n\n42:18.000 --> 42:19.000\nAgreeing with you, yeah.\n\n42:19.000 --> 42:20.000\nHey, Spencer.\n\n42:20.000 --> 42:21.000\nHey, Ryan Ridley.\n\n42:21.000 --> 42:24.000\nWhat's your favorite level of sharpness?\n\n42:24.000 --> 42:25.000\nUm...\n\n42:25.000 --> 42:27.000\nI'd say, you know...\n\n42:27.000 --> 42:28.000\nWait, wait, wait.\n\n42:28.000 --> 42:33.000\nI just wanted the record to show that Ryan gave me a very sly look when he asked that question.\n\n42:33.000 --> 42:34.000\nWatch this.\n\n42:34.000 --> 42:37.000\nI think I finally figured this controlling out.\n\n42:37.000 --> 42:39.000\nLike, the trap has been set.\n\n42:39.000 --> 42:41.000\nI'm about to let her rip.\n\n42:43.000 --> 42:45.000\nExtra sharp, I guess.\n\n42:45.000 --> 42:46.000\nThat's the right answer.\n\n42:46.000 --> 42:48.000\nAll right.\n\n42:48.000 --> 42:50.000\nI could have made that up.\n\n42:50.000 --> 42:53.000\nAsk me what my favorite type of denim is.\n\n42:53.000 --> 42:55.000\nWhat's your favorite type of denim?\n\n42:55.000 --> 42:58.000\nUh, high-grade, best denim.\n\n42:58.000 --> 43:00.000\nHe's right. That's a good grade.\n\n43:00.000 --> 43:03.000\nIf the sharp might be too sharp for some people, anybody? Anybody?\n\n43:03.000 --> 43:06.000\nWell, why didn't you tell him he was right when he said extra sharp?\n\n43:06.000 --> 43:09.000\nBecause I hear how two people clapped.\n\n43:09.000 --> 43:12.000\nBecause I am right.\n\n43:12.000 --> 43:13.000\nAll right.\n\n43:13.000 --> 43:15.000\nWe've got to give Ryan his opinions.\n\n43:15.000 --> 43:16.000\nAll right.\n\n43:16.000 --> 43:18.000\nIf you've just tuned in...\n\n43:18.000 --> 43:27.000\nIf you decide, if you ask yourself, what's going on in a minute, 54 of a podcast?\n\n43:27.000 --> 43:30.000\nThis may become a spin-off podcast.\n\n43:30.000 --> 43:33.000\nJeez, craftsmen.\n\n43:33.000 --> 43:40.000\nWe went to Holland once, me and Aaron and Rob Straub and his wife.\n\n43:40.000 --> 43:46.000\nAnd we somehow, like, we had asked the travel agent, like, or she was like,\n\n43:46.000 --> 43:50.000\nyou want me to help you? Have a good time?\n\n43:50.000 --> 43:54.000\nNot like that. That sounds weird.\n\n43:54.000 --> 43:58.000\nAnd we're like, yeah, I guess it's just like, you know, you should take a tour of the windmills\n\n43:58.000 --> 44:00.000\nand where they make the cheese and stuff.\n\n44:00.000 --> 44:03.000\nAnd it was like, we were like, okay, at some point, someone agreed to this.\n\n44:03.000 --> 44:09.000\nSo, I think someone just asked the hotel owner, like, could they...\n\n44:09.000 --> 44:13.000\nIs there someone that would want to take them out and look at the windmills and the cheese?\n\n44:13.000 --> 44:16.000\nAnd then that guy must have been like, okay, sure.\n\n44:16.000 --> 44:19.000\nAnd then got off the phone and was like, what the fuck are they talking about?\n\n44:19.000 --> 44:21.000\nAnd called another guy.\n\n44:21.000 --> 44:25.000\nSo, long story short, like, one morning we all have to get on our winter clothes\n\n44:25.000 --> 44:30.000\nand go out in the front of the hotel where this guy, he's a cab driver.\n\n44:30.000 --> 44:33.000\nAnd he's just the guy that the hotel owner knows.\n\n44:33.000 --> 44:35.000\nCan you drive them to the windmills?\n\n44:35.000 --> 44:36.000\nHe's a fixer.\n\n44:36.000 --> 44:40.000\nAnd then also, yeah, like, here's some extra money.\n\n44:40.000 --> 44:43.000\nTell them about the windmills and the cheese.\n\n44:43.000 --> 44:47.000\nAnd so this guy was just walking around, chain smoking, talking about the windmills.\n\n44:47.000 --> 44:49.000\nBut he was just a guy.\n\n44:49.000 --> 44:53.000\nAnd we went into this cheese factory and that's when it got really weird.\n\n44:53.000 --> 44:57.000\nBecause he walked in and he was like trying to earn this money he made,\n\n44:57.000 --> 44:59.000\nbut he was just a cab driver.\n\n44:59.000 --> 45:02.000\nBut he was in this cheese museum and factory.\n\n45:02.000 --> 45:09.000\nSo he was like walking up onto the exhibit and fucking with cheese.\n\n45:09.000 --> 45:12.000\nLike, touching the exhibit cheese.\n\n45:12.000 --> 45:16.000\nAnd then people would come over and yell at him and dutch.\n\n45:16.000 --> 45:20.000\nAnd then he'd say something and dutch back and be pointing at us.\n\n45:20.000 --> 45:24.000\nAnd I was clearly saying, like, look, I have these four American people.\n\n45:24.000 --> 45:26.000\nLike, I'm being paid a lot of money.\n\n45:26.000 --> 45:29.000\nI'll give you 20% if you let me keep rolling with this.\n\n45:29.000 --> 45:33.000\nAnd they would kind of walk away confused, go back behind the gift counter.\n\n45:33.000 --> 45:35.000\nAnd he's like, shurning shit.\n\n45:35.000 --> 45:39.000\nLike, don't touch this. He's behind the velvet rope going.\n\n45:39.000 --> 45:42.000\nAnd then there's other tourists gathering and going like,\n\n45:42.000 --> 45:45.000\noh, this guy's talking about how to make cheese.\n\n45:45.000 --> 45:47.000\nHe doesn't work there.\n\n45:47.000 --> 45:49.000\nHe had lost his mind.\n\n45:49.000 --> 45:52.000\nHe was a rogue cheese exhibitor.\n\n45:52.000 --> 45:55.000\nAnd then he's like, and then we do this and then we do that.\n\n45:55.000 --> 45:57.000\nAnd he's like, he kept using the word we.\n\n45:57.000 --> 46:00.000\nAnd I'm looking around at everyone in their dirndles and their wood shoes\n\n46:00.000 --> 46:02.000\nand their napkin hats or whatever.\n\n46:02.000 --> 46:05.000\nAnd they're like rolling their eyes.\n\n46:05.000 --> 46:07.000\nThe cab driver has taken over the museum.\n\n46:07.000 --> 46:09.000\nHe's lost his mind.\n\n46:09.000 --> 46:11.000\nWe don't have police here.\n\n46:11.000 --> 46:12.000\nWe just have a bunch of cameras.\n\n46:12.000 --> 46:13.000\nWeed is legal.\n\n46:13.000 --> 46:15.000\nSo what is this?\n\n46:15.000 --> 46:18.000\nAnd the guy is showing us how they make cheese.\n\n46:18.000 --> 46:19.000\nHe grates some.\n\n46:19.000 --> 46:21.000\nHe peels off a slice.\n\n46:21.000 --> 46:23.000\nAnd then he goes, and we do this, and we do this, and we do this.\n\n46:23.000 --> 46:24.000\nAnd then we eat it.\n\n46:24.000 --> 46:25.000\nAnd it's good.\n\n46:25.000 --> 46:26.000\nAnd he just eats it.\n\n46:26.000 --> 46:29.000\nHe eats the museum cheese.\n\n46:29.000 --> 46:30.000\nHe ate it.\n\n46:30.000 --> 46:32.000\nAnd he was talking with his mouth full.\n\n46:32.000 --> 46:36.000\nHe's eating cheese from the, it was museum cheese.\n\n46:36.000 --> 46:37.000\nWell, that's gross.\n\n46:37.000 --> 46:38.000\nHe ate it.\n\n46:38.000 --> 46:44.000\nIt could have been like the cheese that George Washington brought to Hollis.\n\n46:44.000 --> 46:47.000\nHe didn't know anyone there or what was going on.\n\n46:47.000 --> 46:48.000\nHe just.\n\n46:48.000 --> 46:54.000\nHe's not, he's not handling it with, he doesn't have, this is a dumb question.\n\n46:54.000 --> 46:55.000\nNo gloves, right?\n\n46:55.000 --> 46:56.000\nNo!\n\n46:56.000 --> 46:57.000\nWow!\n\n46:57.000 --> 46:59.000\nCigarette, nicotine, fingers.\n\n46:59.000 --> 47:04.000\nCheese, he's in the fucking, there's mannequins next to him.\n\n47:04.000 --> 47:06.000\nThat's the environment he's in.\n\n47:06.000 --> 47:15.000\nHe's on a stage behind a rope designed to keep normal people like cab drivers from going\n\n47:15.000 --> 47:23.000\nup and using what is essentially a fake kitchen to go, oh, let's make some cheese.\n\n47:23.000 --> 47:26.000\nNo, we put a rope so you don't.\n\n47:26.000 --> 47:30.000\nIt's a mannequin pretending to make cheese in 1820.\n\n47:30.000 --> 47:33.000\nThat's what this is for, is for looking.\n\n47:33.000 --> 47:35.000\nAnd he's pumping into shit.\n\n47:35.000 --> 47:38.000\nHe's fucking, he's got one of those caps on.\n\n47:38.000 --> 47:42.000\nHe's just, he's just, it looks like Benny Hill.\n\n47:42.000 --> 47:44.000\nDid he seem like he knew what he was talking about?\n\n47:44.000 --> 47:45.000\nNo!\n\n47:45.000 --> 47:46.000\nNo!\n\n47:46.000 --> 47:47.000\nNo!\n\n47:47.000 --> 47:49.000\nI should have known.\n\n47:49.000 --> 47:52.000\nLike he knows that cheese is old milk.\n\n47:52.000 --> 47:53.000\nThat's it.\n\n47:53.000 --> 47:57.000\nHe knew everything I know about cheese and he had an accent.\n\n47:57.000 --> 48:00.000\nAnd he just, and then he was just eating shit.\n\n48:00.000 --> 48:06.000\nAnd then we were walking around, we just felt like the worst like American shitty third\n\n48:06.000 --> 48:10.000\nact of fucking Wally people, you know.\n\n48:10.000 --> 48:15.000\nLike we just felt like we were these big fat boneless Americans that had like co-opted\n\n48:15.000 --> 48:20.000\nsome guy and he was like explaining them money, money, money, money, cheese, cheese, cheese.\n\n48:20.000 --> 48:23.000\nNow my son gets his teeth fixed.\n\n48:23.000 --> 48:26.000\nYes, yes.\n\n48:26.000 --> 48:28.000\nHegemony.\n\n48:28.000 --> 48:33.000\nI mean, that sounds like a better tour than you'd ever get from an official Cheese Museum\n\n48:33.000 --> 48:34.000\ntour.\n\n48:34.000 --> 48:35.000\nWell, I feel like you lucked out.\n\n48:35.000 --> 48:40.000\nI wouldn't have gone to a Cheese Museum, but I often, every once in a while, can look\n\n48:40.000 --> 48:43.000\nover at my fiance and go, do you remember the Cheese Museum?\n\n48:43.000 --> 48:44.000\nYes, I do.\n\n48:44.000 --> 48:45.000\nAnd that's kind of fun.\n\n48:45.000 --> 48:46.000\nThat's good.\n\n48:46.000 --> 48:48.000\nThat's what traveling is really about.\n\n48:48.000 --> 48:50.000\nIn the moment, it felt very awkward.\n\n48:50.000 --> 48:52.000\nDid he offer you any of the cheese?\n\n48:52.000 --> 48:53.000\nNo.\n\n48:53.000 --> 48:54.000\nNo.\n\n48:54.000 --> 48:55.000\nThat's the weirdest part.\n\n48:55.000 --> 48:56.000\nThat is the weirdest part.\n\n48:56.000 --> 48:58.000\nHe ate it in front of everyone.\n\n48:58.000 --> 49:00.000\nPeople were taking pictures of him.\n\n49:00.000 --> 49:05.000\nThey thought he was like some kind of performer, like an improviser.\n\n49:05.000 --> 49:09.000\nLike a cheese mascot, like I'm a representative, I don't know anything, but I'm enthusiastic\n\n49:09.000 --> 49:10.000\nand that's enough.\n\n49:10.000 --> 49:12.000\nOr that he was part that he worked there.\n\n49:12.000 --> 49:14.000\nThey thought what they should have thought.\n\n49:14.000 --> 49:19.000\nLike because I don't know how long you could do that before someone tases you.\n\n49:19.000 --> 49:21.000\nBut museum staff just gave up.\n\n49:21.000 --> 49:22.000\nThey're like, we don't want to touch this.\n\n49:22.000 --> 49:24.000\nThey did it because he was just insistent.\n\n49:24.000 --> 49:28.000\nThey said they did all a human should have to do, which is, please, clearly I don't speak\n\n49:28.000 --> 49:31.000\ntheir language, but they were clearly saying, please, please stop.\n\n49:31.000 --> 49:32.000\nYeah.\n\n49:32.000 --> 49:34.000\nPlease stop running around.\n\n49:34.000 --> 49:39.000\nOur private property, like banging into things, knocking over mannequins and stealing cheese.\n\n49:39.000 --> 49:41.000\nPlease stop doing that.\n\n49:41.000 --> 49:43.000\nThey don't give up that easily at the Louvre.\n\n49:43.000 --> 49:44.000\nNot much.\n\n49:44.000 --> 49:45.000\nAll right.\n\n49:45.000 --> 49:48.000\nHe's fucking with Mona Lisa.\n\n49:48.000 --> 49:49.000\nYeah.\n\n49:49.000 --> 49:50.000\nSo you should go there.\n\n49:50.000 --> 49:51.000\nI mean, I don't know.\n\n49:51.000 --> 49:55.000\nIt's crazy.\n\n49:55.000 --> 49:56.000\nIt's weird.\n\n49:56.000 --> 49:58.000\nWindmills are weird.\n\n49:58.000 --> 50:00.000\nYou know what those things do on the inside?\n\n50:00.000 --> 50:02.000\nWhen you see a picture of a windmill, you're like, why do they make those?\n\n50:02.000 --> 50:03.000\nThere's like big pinwheels.\n\n50:03.000 --> 50:05.000\nYou know, when you're a kid, you're like, why do they?\n\n50:05.000 --> 50:07.000\nWell, there's still a lot of work to put into.\n\n50:07.000 --> 50:12.000\nYou know, the things on the inside, most of them, they saw lumber.\n\n50:12.000 --> 50:13.000\nYou know what they do with it?\n\n50:13.000 --> 50:16.000\nThey make more windmills.\n\n50:16.000 --> 50:20.000\nWindmills are like a virus.\n\n50:20.000 --> 50:25.000\nThey take over the T-cells, and then they just like, if we hadn't stopped these people\n\n50:25.000 --> 50:30.000\nin their tracks, our world would be covered with windmills for no reason.\n\n50:30.000 --> 50:32.000\nThey wouldn't be generating electricity.\n\n50:32.000 --> 50:35.000\nThey would just be generating more windmills.\n\n50:35.000 --> 50:39.000\nIf we would make first contact on the flanks after we'd bump off of the earth because\n\n50:39.000 --> 50:42.000\nthere would be these fucking blades spinning everywhere.\n\n50:42.000 --> 50:44.000\nYou know, they would have eventually started making a lot of plastic,\n\n50:44.000 --> 50:48.000\nand they would have been toxic.\n\n50:48.000 --> 50:50.000\nIt's very interesting, though.\n\n50:50.000 --> 50:53.000\nThey make windmills over there.\n\n50:53.000 --> 50:56.000\nThere's people that make them just like they used to.\n\n50:56.000 --> 50:58.000\nWe're only going to use the equipment they used to use.\n\n50:58.000 --> 51:02.000\nIt just seems like, so, God, you've got to really be into something.\n\n51:02.000 --> 51:04.000\nI was like, why that?\n\n51:04.000 --> 51:06.000\nWe're just going to use...\n\n51:06.000 --> 51:10.000\nWe think Civil War re-enactors are weird. These windmill re-enactors.\n\n51:10.000 --> 51:13.000\nWe're going to make a windmill. We're not going to use any hammers.\n\n51:13.000 --> 51:15.000\nWe're not going to use anything made of metal.\n\n51:15.000 --> 51:17.000\nIs there new cutting-edge windmill technology?\n\n51:17.000 --> 51:19.000\nYeah, definitely.\n\n51:19.000 --> 51:24.000\nDo you mean the things that generate wind power? Electricity?\n\n51:24.000 --> 51:26.000\nThey don't just saw wood anymore.\n\n51:26.000 --> 51:27.000\nWhat do they do now?\n\n51:27.000 --> 51:29.000\nThey generate electricity.\n\n51:29.000 --> 51:32.000\nCan you call those windmills, though?\n\n51:32.000 --> 51:34.000\nI call them windmills.\n\n51:34.000 --> 51:38.000\nI get, like, being into some OG windmill shit.\n\n51:38.000 --> 51:43.000\nIt's like, you know, guitar dad who will only use two-bamps, you know?\n\n51:43.000 --> 51:47.000\nWho have a man cave full of old two-bamps, and they've got to get them replaced.\n\n51:47.000 --> 51:51.000\nOne guitar shop in Calabasas, and they know the guy behind the counter.\n\n51:51.000 --> 51:55.000\nI'm sure that's how vintage windmill heads are.\n\n51:55.000 --> 52:00.000\nWhen I was programming, I used the VI editor,\n\n52:00.000 --> 52:05.000\nand I didn't want to use my mouse. I used the keys.\n\n52:05.000 --> 52:09.000\nIt's a 35-year-old editor.\n\n52:09.000 --> 52:15.000\nI want to design my own webpage, editing with text on an SSH connection or whatever.\n\n52:15.000 --> 52:17.000\nI guess I was into the purity of that.\n\n52:17.000 --> 52:22.000\nYeah, well, I mean, when I went to film school, they make you edit film on a steamback,\n\n52:22.000 --> 52:24.000\nlike an old-school spinning plates.\n\n52:24.000 --> 52:26.000\nYeah, because you're little white gloves, and you're splicing.\n\n52:26.000 --> 52:29.000\nYeah, and you're a little pencil to mark where an edit was.\n\n52:29.000 --> 52:32.000\nAnd they're like, okay, so now you know how that works. Here's final cut.\n\n52:32.000 --> 52:34.000\nYeah, exactly.\n\n52:34.000 --> 52:38.000\nIt was such a colossal waste of time, and my only takeaway from it is, like,\n\n52:38.000 --> 52:40.000\nthat's the hardest thing I've ever done.\n\n52:40.000 --> 52:43.000\nYeah, you're like, that's why this mouse clicker is shaped like that.\n\n52:43.000 --> 52:48.000\nThat's why they use that icon, because it's based on some guy with a white glove.\n\n52:48.000 --> 52:50.000\nJust, yeah, sitting there.\n\n52:50.000 --> 52:56.000\nAnd the other thing I learned is, like, don't set an entire opened, but full orange juice\n\n52:56.000 --> 52:58.000\non one of the spinning plates that the film goes on.\n\n52:58.000 --> 53:00.000\nRight.\n\n53:00.000 --> 53:03.000\nYeah, that was, like, four hours of my life.\n\n53:03.000 --> 53:07.000\nBut the film got done. The montage of my friend dancing on the street\n\n53:07.000 --> 53:12.000\nset to an RJD2 beat got done, and I got an A.\n\n53:12.000 --> 53:14.000\nAnd then I moved to Los Angeles.\n\n53:14.000 --> 53:16.000\nSo, I mean...\n\n53:16.000 --> 53:21.000\nDid it get an A? Because in between, you would just flash the words capitalism or something?\n\n53:21.000 --> 53:22.000\nYeah.\n\n53:22.000 --> 53:25.000\nThere was a lot of deep meaning.\n\n53:25.000 --> 53:29.000\nHey, Dave. Was it a pulp?\n\n53:29.000 --> 53:34.000\nOr pulp-free?\n\n53:34.000 --> 53:37.000\nYeah, I found my niche.\n\n53:37.000 --> 53:40.000\nYou did it! He did it!\n\n53:40.000 --> 53:42.000\nCome on!\n\n53:42.000 --> 53:46.000\nWhat a great night for Comptroller Ryan Ridley.\n\n53:46.000 --> 53:48.000\nThis guy's great.\n\n53:48.000 --> 53:52.000\nHe cares about the minutiae of things you ingest.\n\n53:52.000 --> 53:53.000\nThat's his angle.\n\n53:53.000 --> 53:54.000\nRidley stores.\n\n53:54.000 --> 53:56.000\nYou know, Jeff wears suits.\n\n53:56.000 --> 53:59.000\nYou ask questions about eating.\n\n53:59.000 --> 54:00.000\nRound of applause.\n\n54:00.000 --> 54:07.000\nCrunchy peanut butter.\n\n54:07.000 --> 54:11.000\nI heard somebody booing.\n\n54:11.000 --> 54:14.000\nCreamy peanut butter.\n\n54:14.000 --> 54:15.000\nWow.\n\n54:15.000 --> 54:16.000\nEven.\n\n54:16.000 --> 54:17.000\nThat's a 50-50 split.\n\n54:17.000 --> 54:19.000\nBut the creamy people were yelling and going,\n\n54:19.000 --> 54:24.000\nWell, the creamies seem forced, like they're like, we really gotta stand up for creamy.\n\n54:24.000 --> 54:26.000\nWell, how many people are ambi peanut butter?\n\n54:26.000 --> 54:28.000\nHow many people can do crunchy or creamy?\n\n54:28.000 --> 54:31.000\nOh, really? Not that many.\n\n54:31.000 --> 54:33.000\nWhy would you even bother with creamy?\n\n54:33.000 --> 54:34.000\nIt's what I want to know.\n\n54:34.000 --> 54:36.000\nI guess sometimes it's good.\n\n54:36.000 --> 54:37.000\nI don't know. I like both.\n\n54:37.000 --> 54:42.000\nI wouldn't want either to be outlawed.\n\n54:42.000 --> 54:46.000\nThis is the gentlest conversation that's ever happened on this stage.\n\n54:46.000 --> 54:51.000\nWe're going to be 85 years old and we can still have the same conversation.\n\n54:51.000 --> 54:53.000\nThat's what's nice about it.\n\n54:53.000 --> 54:57.000\nOh, those ladies' skirts keep getting shorter.\n\n54:57.000 --> 54:58.000\nBut peanut butter?\n\n54:58.000 --> 55:01.000\nThis is like the first 20 minutes of those Kirk Cameron Christian movies.\n\n55:01.000 --> 55:03.000\nLike, hey man.\n\n55:03.000 --> 55:06.000\nHey, if you want to know how to get the most peanut butter in the world,\n\n55:06.000 --> 55:08.000\nI'm going to tell you.\n\n55:08.000 --> 55:11.000\nIt's about the power of positivity.\n\n55:11.000 --> 55:14.000\nJesus Christ.\n\n55:14.000 --> 55:18.000\nPray. I can pray for it.\n\n55:18.000 --> 55:20.000\nThis is what drives me nuts about Christianity.\n\n55:20.000 --> 55:24.000\nNot Christianity, the actual mythology,\n\n55:24.000 --> 55:27.000\nwhich I think is, I enjoy.\n\n55:27.000 --> 55:31.000\nThe story of a guy who got killed on purpose is awesome.\n\n55:31.000 --> 55:33.000\nThat's fucking amazing.\n\n55:33.000 --> 55:38.000\nIt is truly one of the top three greatest stories I've ever told.\n\n55:38.000 --> 55:43.000\nI'm going to go Iron Giant and Monster House for the other two.\n\n55:43.000 --> 55:49.000\nYou're saying, you have a problem with the people who tell the story and how they tell it.\n\n55:49.000 --> 55:52.000\nI have a problem with something that, by proper definitions,\n\n55:52.000 --> 55:57.000\nshouldn't even be called Christianity, which is this weird capitalist.\n\n55:57.000 --> 56:01.000\nWe're wearing suits and we're talking about Jesus and we even tell people,\n\n56:01.000 --> 56:03.000\nyou don't even have to read the Bible.\n\n56:03.000 --> 56:05.000\nYou know what's great about Christianity?\n\n56:05.000 --> 56:06.000\nHe's knocking at your door.\n\n56:06.000 --> 56:09.000\nAll you got to do is accept him as your personal Christ and savior,\n\n56:09.000 --> 56:12.000\nthe blood of the blood flood.\n\n56:12.000 --> 56:15.000\nAnd that's it. And just keep coming back and let's just hang out.\n\n56:15.000 --> 56:17.000\nLet's just be Christian.\n\n56:17.000 --> 56:24.000\nIt's like this frantic thing that has absolutely no love for the actual mythology anymore.\n\n56:24.000 --> 56:27.000\nSo it's clearly totally separated from it,\n\n56:27.000 --> 56:30.000\nespecially the fact that you don't get me started on it.\n\n56:30.000 --> 56:32.000\nLiterally, nobody clapped.\n\n56:32.000 --> 56:39.000\nThis is an audience of, I think, this mahogany dense atheist log here.\n\n56:39.000 --> 56:42.000\nI don't know how that happened.\n\n56:42.000 --> 56:44.000\nI guess I'll take that as a compliment.\n\n56:44.000 --> 56:47.000\nI'm very smart or something, so I just attract atheists.\n\n56:47.000 --> 56:57.000\nSo I don't think I would be preaching to the non-quirer by ranting about this,\n\n56:57.000 --> 57:03.000\nbut I think the thing that makes most people atheists and proud of it and evangelical about it\n\n57:03.000 --> 57:09.000\nis that it's a modern American phenomenon that happens to be called Christianity,\n\n57:09.000 --> 57:19.000\nwhich has absolutely nothing to do with the ethos, the pathos, or the porthos.\n\n57:19.000 --> 57:30.000\nI demand a religion hit all three musketeers before I accept it.\n\n57:30.000 --> 57:32.000\nEven the jolly drunk one.\n\n57:32.000 --> 57:34.000\nWhy is that porth musketeer?\n\n57:34.000 --> 57:36.000\nWho is that guy?\n\n57:36.000 --> 57:38.000\nHe's our road in.\n\n57:38.000 --> 57:40.000\nWhy didn't he get lumped in?\n\n57:40.000 --> 57:43.000\nHe's like the kid in Treasure Island.\n\n57:43.000 --> 57:45.000\nHe's like, boy, those three musketeers.\n\n57:45.000 --> 57:47.000\nI've never read it, seen the movies.\n\n57:47.000 --> 57:49.000\nI just know there's a porth guy.\n\n57:49.000 --> 57:51.000\nI'm like, why isn't it called the four musketeers?\n\n57:51.000 --> 57:53.000\nOkay, I get it.\n\n57:53.000 --> 57:55.000\nI bet at the end, they say, from now on...\n\n57:55.000 --> 57:57.000\nHere's your sword.\n\n57:57.000 --> 58:02.000\nCan you give me one of those swords?\n\n58:02.000 --> 58:04.000\nSure, Earthos.\n\n58:04.000 --> 58:06.000\nHe brings it back and he hands it to Earthos.\n\n58:06.000 --> 58:12.000\nAnd Earthos is like, no, no one's yours.\n\n58:12.000 --> 58:18.000\nAnd they're like, all for one and one plus one for all.\n\n58:18.000 --> 58:23.000\nAnd then as the crane shot goes away, you just hear an ADR line from D'Artagnan going,\n\n58:23.000 --> 58:26.000\nwhat about my musket?\n\n58:26.000 --> 58:29.000\nAm I crazy or should we have muskets?\n\n58:29.000 --> 58:34.000\nWhy are we famous for sword fighting?\n\n58:34.000 --> 58:36.000\nThis is insane what we do.\n\n58:36.000 --> 58:40.000\nWhy are we putting so much energy into swords?\n\n58:40.000 --> 58:46.000\nThey invented the gun for us.\n\n58:46.000 --> 58:48.000\nLet's shoot some of them.\n\n58:48.000 --> 58:51.000\nI feel like D'Artagnan's inclusion is probably conditional.\n\n58:51.000 --> 58:53.000\nEven if at the end he gets his own sword,\n\n58:53.000 --> 58:56.000\nit's just a drive, like turtle for Monterey.\n\n58:56.000 --> 58:58.000\nYou can hang out, turtle.\n\n58:58.000 --> 59:04.000\nYou can have the fourth hottest girl, but you gotta drive the Escalade.\n\n59:04.000 --> 59:07.000\nHe has to hang up the flyers and book the rooms.\n\n59:07.000 --> 59:09.000\nHey guys, we're having a duel.\n\n59:09.000 --> 59:11.000\nHere we go, we're having a duel.\n\n59:11.000 --> 59:13.000\nIt's gonna be dope.\n\n59:13.000 --> 59:16.000\nWhen the musketeer's coming to town, he goes into the hotel and they stay in the van.\n\n59:16.000 --> 59:18.000\nHe comes back out with other keys.\n\n59:18.000 --> 59:27.000\nI'm gonna be spinning, it's gonna be dope.\n\n59:27.000 --> 59:29.000\nWell, what do you think, Spencer?\n\n59:29.000 --> 59:33.000\nDo you think these guys could play some of this D&D stuff?\n\n59:33.000 --> 59:34.000\nI don't know, Dan.\n\n59:34.000 --> 59:36.000\nI don't think they got what it takes.\n\n59:36.000 --> 59:38.000\nHey, what?\n\n59:38.000 --> 59:39.000\nMaybe it's a little early.\n\n59:39.000 --> 59:44.000\nShould we meet one out-of-town friend before we...\n\n59:44.000 --> 59:49.000\nWho is here from a far away?\n\n59:49.000 --> 59:50.000\nScotland, I heard.\n\n59:50.000 --> 59:59.000\nOrange County?\n\n59:59.000 --> 01:00:00.000\nAustralia.\n\n01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:05.000\nWe did Australia last week, not that that's how it works.\n\n01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:09.000\nI know there's millions of people there.\n\n01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000\nWe were out of kangaroo jokes.\n\n01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:12.000\nWhat did you say?\n\n01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.000\nBoston.\n\n01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:14.000\nBoston?\n\n01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.000\nThat's nice.\n\n01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:16.000\nI like it in Boston.\n\n01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000\nIt's like the Milwaukee of the East Coast.\n\n01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000\nWho's from the most dangerous place?\n\n01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:21.000\nBoston.\n\n01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:22.000\nAustralia.\n\n01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:23.000\nAustralia, yeah.\n\n01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:28.000\nThey're peopled with criminals.\n\n01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:38.000\nScotland person, are you willing to come up and share your persona with us?\n\n01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:39.000\nNo?\n\n01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:40.000\nOkay.\n\n01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:41.000\nOkay!\n\n01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:44.000\nThat persona's off to a good start.\n\n01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:47.000\nShe's very positive.\n\n01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:51.000\nWe don't pick on anybody here.\n\n01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.000\nHello.\n\n01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.000\nHello.\n\n01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:57.000\nYou look like a Scottish movie Scottish person.\n\n01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:01.000\nShe's wearing boots and tights and a t-shirt that says Trey Cool on it.\n\n01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:02.000\nAlthough that's French.\n\n01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000\nNo, not at all.\n\n01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000\nNo, I'm applauding your Scottishness.\n\n01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.000\nThank you.\n\n01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.000\nIt's like indie movie Scottish.\n\n01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:15.000\nIt's like a movie that's really good, but there's subtitles because they're so Scottish.\n\n01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000\nSo what's your name?\n\n01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.000\nPaula.\n\n01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.000\nPaula.\n\n01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:20.000\nWhat part is Scotland?\n\n01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:21.000\nJust say Glasgow.\n\n01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:22.000\nOh, okay.\n\n01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:23.000\nI know where that is.\n\n01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:27.000\nThe opposite say it's where he's wearing a...\n\n01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000\nWhere we were for Hogman-y?\n\n01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:30.000\nYeah.\n\n01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.000\nYeah.\n\n01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.000\nEdinburgh.\n\n01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:33.000\nEdinburgh.\n\n01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:36.000\nEdinburgh, which is spelled Edinburgh, but then it's a trap.\n\n01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:42.000\nIt seems like a nice Jewish town, Edinburgh.\n\n01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:47.000\nJust went there to get some relaxation.\n\n01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:48.000\nEveryone's carrying torches.\n\n01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.000\nThis is fucking crazy.\n\n01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000\nDid you ever do Hogman-y in Edinburgh?\n\n01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:56.000\nNo, I've done it in Glasgow and then it's usually just house parties, but no.\n\n01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000\nI don't really like Edinburgh.\n\n01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000\nWe did the whole torch procession when we were there.\n\n01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.000\nIt was crazy.\n\n01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:04.000\nIt seems kind of dangerous having that many people in torches.\n\n01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:09.000\nYeah, when you do something that dangerous with a group of people...\n\n01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:14.000\nI guess we've already talked about it on the show, but it was really uplifting because\n\n01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:18.000\nit really made you feel like, oh, America's wearing this big diaper.\n\n01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:23.000\nWe were obsessed with tits and violence and bad words and all these things.\n\n01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:26.000\nAmerica's got a lot of great things about it.\n\n01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:30.000\nFluoride in the water, most cities.\n\n01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:31.000\nI don't know.\n\n01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.000\nWe're great.\n\n01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:35.000\nThe Golden Age of Television, mostly our responsibility.\n\n01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:36.000\nYou should start something.\n\n01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:39.000\nGet people carrying torches out the streets.\n\n01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:42.000\nWell, as we've spoken, there's another reason we don't do it here.\n\n01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:47.000\nIt has an unfortunate feel to it for us.\n\n01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000\nIt doesn't represent his passion.\n\n01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:52.000\nIt's more of a cowardly, like, oh, I got a flaming stick.\n\n01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:55.000\nGet away, black guy.\n\n01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:59.000\nStop taking our jerbs.\n\n01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:03.000\nIt was like, we did this big parade where I'll carry these torches and it was like,\n\n01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000\nthere were kids and everyone was like, there's fucking like...\n\n01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:06.000\nIt's a big thing.\n\n01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:09.000\nYou buy the torches at a wall, whatever the equivalent of a Walmart is.\n\n01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:10.000\nAsda.\n\n01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:14.000\nAnd it's like, they sell them because everyone's going to do this thing.\n\n01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:18.000\nAnd it's kind of cool because it's like the opposite of disempowering a population.\n\n01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:22.000\nNobody does anything bad with the torches, but you're being allowed to carry fire,\n\n01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:27.000\nwhich is dangerous and everyone's walking and there's embers falling on your hair\n\n01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:31.000\nand your clothes and there's like a little bit of like, singeing and fire happening.\n\n01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:32.000\nBut everyone's fine.\n\n01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:33.000\nEveryone turns out fine.\n\n01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:37.000\nAnd then you go watch this wicker thing start on fire.\n\n01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:38.000\nYeah, I could have done it.\n\n01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000\nSo you're saying it to me.\n\n01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:41.000\nAnd they're playing...\n\n01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:45.000\nThe only problem is they're playing music the whole way.\n\n01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:48.000\nThey have speakers set up the whole, like, many mile, like, march.\n\n01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:53.000\nAnd they're playing, like, Scottish rock bands and stuff.\n\n01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:57.000\nAnd after a while, you've heard the same ones, like, five times in a row.\n\n01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:01.000\nThere's so many, like, breakouts, Scottish, like, fucking hey.\n\n01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000\nThey're like, oh, this guy's again, huh?\n\n01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000\nSo anyways, Glasgow.\n\n01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:06.000\nAll right.\n\n01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:09.000\nI think we were near there.\n\n01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:12.000\nYou referenced our trip there.\n\n01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:15.000\nWere you connected to us somehow?\n\n01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:18.000\nBecause I know Jeff put people on the guest list for tonight.\n\n01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:22.000\nYou just heard the podcast and heard that we went to Scotland.\n\n01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000\nTwice before.\n\n01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:28.000\nNearly got kicked out twice because I was here with a friend and we were kind of drunk.\n\n01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.000\nOh, is that you?\n\n01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.000\nYeah.\n\n01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:35.000\nIs she here today?\n\n01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.000\nNo.\n\n01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.000\nOkay.\n\n01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:38.000\nWas that the problem?\n\n01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000\nYou had to, like, restructure your friendship?\n\n01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:41.000\nI'm doing okay so far.\n\n01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:42.000\nYeah, I know.\n\n01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:43.000\nYou're great.\n\n01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000\nYou're very, very gentle and well-mannered.\n\n01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000\nYou were fine that night, too.\n\n01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000\nI mean, who cares?\n\n01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:52.000\nDrunk people from Scotland yelling things out.\n\n01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000\nIt's probably the best thing that happened to a show.\n\n01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000\nSo what are you on vacation?\n\n01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:59.000\nI was in Salt Lake City for Comic Con.\n\n01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000\nThey have a Comic Con in Salt Lake City?\n\n01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:02.000\nYeah, it's huge.\n\n01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:03.000\nWow.\n\n01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000\nIt's the second year and it was pretty crazy.\n\n01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.000\nWow.\n\n01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:07.000\nI like that.\n\n01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:08.000\nI was in Salt Lake.\n\n01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:09.000\nThey're very nice people.\n\n01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:13.000\nI think it's again, like, we did the tour there and it's like, the Mormon thing is so strong.\n\n01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:14.000\nThere may be that that's why.\n\n01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:19.000\nThere's, like, the hipster crowd there is very hip because they're, like, breaking away from it.\n\n01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000\nIt was mainly people from Salt Lake there.\n\n01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000\nI don't think there was many out of towners.\n\n01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:24.000\nWell, I don't know.\n\n01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:25.000\nI didn't speak to many people.\n\n01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:26.000\nYeah.\n\n01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:29.000\nI mean, we had a packed house and we did a show there and everybody was really thoughtful\n\n01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:32.000\nand cool and fun and passionate.\n\n01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:37.000\nIt's probably a tough city to be anything fringy in, I would imagine.\n\n01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000\nMaybe that's a stereotype that's outgrown.\n\n01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:40.000\nI don't know.\n\n01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:43.000\nThe Mormons aren't the biggest fringe of them all.\n\n01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:49.000\nDon't turn on your guest comptroller yet.\n\n01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000\nHe's going to come back.\n\n01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:54.000\nHe's going to ask you about bread and butter versus dill pickles at the end.\n\n01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:55.000\nI know it.\n\n01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:59.000\nAnd you're going to wish that you hadn't.\n\n01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:00.000\nI got you, buddy.\n\n01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:01.000\nI thought they'd like that.\n\n01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:02.000\nI liked it.\n\n01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:03.000\nI don't know.\n\n01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:08.000\nAlso, if you're Mormon and you're listening, I have no, absolutely no judgment.\n\n01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:09.000\nI do.\n\n01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:14.000\nI'm going to double down.\n\n01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:15.000\nSmart.\n\n01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:16.000\nThat's smart.\n\n01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:20.000\nWhat the fuck is that shit?\n\n01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:27.000\nYou've had Jews, Christians, and they were on Mormons?\n\n01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:32.000\nWell, when we were in Salt Lake City, I had a Mormon come up and explain some of the things\n\n01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000\nlike, okay, let's talk about this magic underwear.\n\n01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:35.000\nLet's talk about the stuff.\n\n01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:39.000\nBecause she was a very sweet, like she was a Harmonton fan, and she was in this town\n\n01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:42.000\nwhere she was probably surrounded by people who were like, I don't fucking Mormons.\n\n01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:43.000\nI don't know, though.\n\n01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:46.000\nI don't really know what's going on there, but how people feel about it.\n\n01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000\nI'm sure they're all 25 and they don't fucking care anymore.\n\n01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:52.000\nAnd I'm like 41 and going, oh, Mormonism.\n\n01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:55.000\nBut she came up and talked about it.\n\n01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:59.000\nI mean, religion, it says on the bottle, this isn't supposed to make sense.\n\n01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:04.000\nIf you buy a religion, and then you open the bottle and you're like, ah, this isn't logical.\n\n01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000\nLike, you're an idiot.\n\n01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:11.000\nLike, it's like buying a pair of pants and then trying to drink out of them.\n\n01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000\nAnd you're like, this sucks.\n\n01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:14.000\nI want my money back.\n\n01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:17.000\nIt's like, motherfucker, it goes on your legs.\n\n01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:23.000\nYour legs, in this case, being the part of your brain that doesn't understand shit\n\n01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:28.000\nand is frustrated and wonders what your relationship with an impersonal cosmos is\n\n01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000\nand is afraid you're going to die.\n\n01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:36.000\nAnd it's going insane because of the truly schizophrenic result of being the world's first\n\n01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:43.000\nand possibly last sentient mammal, except dolphins, who don't need a religion\n\n01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:46.000\nbecause they don't have hands.\n\n01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:51.000\nSo they don't have weapons, so they don't have war, so they don't need religion.\n\n01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:56.000\nThey just see a shark and they're like, fuck sharks.\n\n01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000\nLike, dolphins go crazy at sharks.\n\n01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.000\nDid you know that?\n\n01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000\nThey fucking hate sharks.\n\n01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000\nIsn't that cool?\n\n01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000\nIt is cool.\n\n01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:08.000\nIt is fucking cool because dolphins are us in the ocean.\n\n01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000\nThey represent us.\n\n01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:15.000\nYou know, they are Ryan and Dave.\n\n01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:20.000\nYou might say, dolphins are the Israelis in the Middle East that is the ocean.\n\n01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000\nOh, now I'm listening.\n\n01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000\nI don't know, hold on.\n\n01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:28.000\nThey're like building apartments on all these coral reefs.\n\n01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:34.000\nNow, suddenly, I'm sympathizing for the sharks.\n\n01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:37.000\nI know, and I accidentally just called Muslims sharks.\n\n01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:40.000\nAnd then thought it was cool.\n\n01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000\nThat's not what I meant.\n\n01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000\nSorry about that.\n\n01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:47.000\nDo they know that sharks are the bad guys?\n\n01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:48.000\nThat's what it is.\n\n01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000\nWell, think about it.\n\n01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:56.000\nDolphins are mammals that breathe oxygen and they have language and shit.\n\n01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000\nLike, they're a new...\n\n01:08:58.000 --> 01:08:59.000\nThey're like us.\n\n01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:00.000\nWhat did you say?\n\n01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000\nThey're assholes. Dolphins are assholes.\n\n01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.000\nThey're assholes.\n\n01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:06.000\nOkay, well, you're coming up in one second, sir.\n\n01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000\nI think he already heard us.\n\n01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:12.000\nA guy with an accent I can't place just blurted out they're assholes.\n\n01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000\nDolphins are assholes.\n\n01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000\nWell, what about sharks?\n\n01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000\nYeah, sharks are assholes.\n\n01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000\nNo opinion on sharks but dolphins are assholes?\n\n01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000\nNo, you stay Paula.\n\n01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:23.000\nIt's Paula, right?\n\n01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:24.000\nYeah.\n\n01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:25.000\nOkay, and you sit there, sir.\n\n01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:26.000\nAndy.\n\n01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:27.000\nAndy.\n\n01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:28.000\nOkay, so explain.\n\n01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:29.000\nDolphins are assholes.\n\n01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:30.000\nDolphins are assholes.\n\n01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:31.000\nWell, male dolphins are assholes.\n\n01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:32.000\nMale dolphins.\n\n01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:36.000\nYeah, yeah, they separate the women from the pack and then don't let them back into the\n\n01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000\npod until they've had sex with them.\n\n01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:39.000\nOh, okay.\n\n01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:43.000\nSo when you dig into dolphin like gender hierarchies, okay.\n\n01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000\nThat's interesting.\n\n01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:48.000\nWe're looking at it from very far away.\n\n01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:51.000\nThey're so smart and they're like, yeah, we're smart enough to hate bitches.\n\n01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000\nWow, hold on.\n\n01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:56.000\nThey don't get to dolphin vote.\n\n01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:03.000\nI think, well.\n\n01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:11.000\nDude, you were going to say something about...\n\n01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:21.000\nI was just going to say hashtag yes all dolphins.\n\n01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:27.000\nSo Andy, is that a dolphin fact you picked up just as a casual dolphin fanner?\n\n01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:28.000\nAre you like a...\n\n01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:31.000\nI want you to say you're an oceanographer.\n\n01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:36.000\nWho like really love dolphins and then they fucking let you down.\n\n01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:40.000\nLike you spent eight years learning to communicate with them to the point where you could hear\n\n01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000\ntheir opinions about women.\n\n01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000\nAnd you're like, fuck.\n\n01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:47.000\nI learned to squeak for this.\n\n01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000\nThis guy's rapey.\n\n01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:55.000\nSure, he could put a ball in the circular hole, but he fucking hates women.\n\n01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:59.000\nIt was one of those articles, you know, 20 things about all four things you know about.\n\n01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000\nYou don't know about animals.\n\n01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000\nI mean, don't get started on office.\n\n01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:04.000\nSo it was all different animals.\n\n01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:14.000\nLike koala bears believe in separate but equal.\n\n01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:18.000\nThey have specially labeled eucalyptus trees.\n\n01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:21.000\nMan, they're just starting all the time.\n\n01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:24.000\nKittens like euthanasia.\n\n01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:25.000\nKittens.\n\n01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000\nWhat's all this shit you didn't know about kittens?\n\n01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000\nThey're really conservative.\n\n01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:33.000\nThey believe that milk should trickle down from their mother's nipples.\n\n01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:37.000\nThey hate abortion.\n\n01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:42.000\nAll right, well, so, but okay, well, Andy, I mean, is it okay if you just make a cameo\n\n01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:45.000\nand then we're not quite done with koala?\n\n01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:48.000\nAnything else to say about dolphins?

Dolphin expert, Andy.\n\n01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:01.000\nI mean, maybe this is, maybe this is just deja vu, but I could swear that earlier on,\n\n01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:07.000\non an earlier episode, a guy with a foreign accent said that dolphins were assholes and\n\n01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000\nthen came up and defended his remarks.\n\n01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000\nLike on a different episode

matter how good you are at it.\n\n01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000\nI've never played it, but I'll give it a bash.\n\n01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:02.000\nHave you heard us play it on the podcast ever?\n\n01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:03.000\nOnce.\n\n01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:04.000\nOkay.\n\n01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:05.000\nYeah.\n\n01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:08.000\nIt's like, what happens is, there's

01:15:23.000\nI hate their fucking assholes.\n\n01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000\nAlso, why did I say I hope they're peeing?\n\n01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000\nThat's weird to say.\n\n01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:30.000\nWhat is this, Hustler magazine?\n\n01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:31.000\nWhat do you know?\n\n01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000\nRemember when Hustler turned into being about peeing?\n\n01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:34.000\nLike, women peeing?\n\n01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:35.000\nNo.\n\n01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000\nWhen was that?\n\n01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:41.000\nHustler, like, if you open a hustler, like, it's like, there's a lot of, like, it's like,\n\n01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:45.000\nsomebody started complaining at some point when there weren't women peeing.\n\n01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:48.000\nAnd so there's just like, they make sure that there's always a woman peeing now.\n\n01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:52.000\nDo you think there was like, an executive decision, like a meeting was called to be like,\n\n01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:56.000\nguys, now, like, starting next month, at least once a month.\n\n01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:57.000\nYeah.\n\n01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:02.000\nThere was obviously like, I don't know, like, I learned about naked women from pages of\n\n01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:07.000\nHustler magazine that floated across the railroad tracks into the crawdad creek where we were\n\n01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:08.000\nhunting crawdad.\n\n01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:12.000\nThey sound like Mark Twain.\n\n01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:18.000\nBut there was like, like, there was no internet and there was just like, mud caked pages from\n\n01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:23.000\nthis printing plant that apparently printed hustlers across the railroad tracks.\n\n01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:28.000\nAnd that's where the, you know, other nine year olds and I would go like, that's a booby.\n\n01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:33.000\nAnd then we would read the stuff like, hey, you can read better.\n\n01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000\nWould your pussy like my dick in it?\n\n01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:38.000\nThis is great.\n\n01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:39.000\nWhat does she say?\n\n01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:40.000\nWhat does she say?\n\n01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000\nThe next page is missing.\n\n01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000\nLaying, laying home awake at night.\n\n01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:49.000\nI hope her pussy likes his dick in it.\n\n01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:53.000\nAnd she was a waitress, he was a truck driver and they just started to, it was a pictorial\n\n01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:57.000\nstory, but the text was, what was important.\n\n01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:01.000\nThat is so much folksier than how this generation like sees pornography.\n\n01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:02.000\nYeah.\n\n01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000\nI don't know what's, but it's, but it's gross.\n\n01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:08.000\nI mean, it's like, I'm looking at my first female figure and it's like, caked in mud.\n\n01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:12.000\nIt's a pretty fundamentally misogynistic, periodic literature.\n\n01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:19.000\nThe pages of which are like smeared with mud, a stench of crawdad and algae.\n\n01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:23.000\nIt's kind of like, I'm learning either that's like the healthiest thing in the world.\n\n01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:27.000\nLike Yoda's in a tree stump going, yes.\n\n01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:33.000\nThe vagina is a terrifying place to go inside.\n\n01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:39.000\nAnd I go in there and I fight something and then my face is on the clitoris.\n\n01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:42.000\nI come out and I go like, I can't talk about it.\n\n01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:45.000\nI'm going to go to Hollywood.\n\n01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:49.000\nBut, but the internet, yeah, it's like, like, like I talked to moms now and they're like,\n\n01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000\nyou know, my eight year old kid.\n\n01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:52.000\nWhat's that?\n\n01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:53.000\nAbout the hustlers.\n\n01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:54.000\nOh, no, no, no.\n\n01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:58.000\nAbout the, about the new hustler, which is even YouTube, even if you were to have like\n\n01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:03.000\nsome kind of nanny blocker software, which is a joke, like you can't control your kid.\n\n01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:06.000\nEven YouTube is just like, I mean, nobody knows better than me.\n\n01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:10.000\nIt is filled with perfectly sexual material.\n\n01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:15.000\nLike, like, like what do you, like, like the, so like your eight year old kid will just\n\n01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000\nbe like, you know, sitting with his eight year old friend.\n\n01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000\nWhat did we do when we were eight year old boys?\n\n01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:24.000\nWe would, we would make these jokes about sex, you know, we would talk about sex with\n\n01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:25.000\neach other.\n\n01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:26.000\nWe were all way off the mark.\n\n01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:29.000\nWe were very curious about it and we were, and we were just fascinated with it.\n\n01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:33.000\nAnd if you had a laptop back then and you could just type something in and if you could\n\n01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:38.000\nbe the kid that brought the other kids to some piece of information about it, you were a\n\n01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:39.000\nhero.\n\n01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:42.000\nSo there's a capitalistic like competition there.\n\n01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:43.000\nThere's no way to control it.\n\n01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:47.000\nI'm really fascinated to talk to moms these days who are.\n\n01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000\nWho are these moms you're talking to?\n\n01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000\nWell, like I'm 41.\n\n01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000\nMy contemporaries have children.\n\n01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:58.000\nLike they're, you know, funny, funny women who do storytelling shows who have kids that\n\n01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:05.000\nare like, they catch like watching shit that's fucked up and then hearing them talk about\n\n01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:06.000\nit is very interesting.\n\n01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:13.000\nIf only I could remember that one lady's name that I'm characterizing as all these women.\n\n01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:19.000\nBut the dolphin in me says, who cares what her name is?\n\n01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:24.000\nLet her have the kid and like see if she earns the right to swim, swim, swim.\n\n01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:25.000\nWhat do they eat shrimp?\n\n01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:26.000\nI don't know.\n\n01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:27.000\nAll right.\n\n01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:28.000\nThey hate sharks.\n\n01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:29.000\nThey hate sharks.\n\n01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:32.500\nThey see a shark and they fucking like ram it with their noses until the shark is good\n\n01:19:32.500 --> 01:19:33.500\nand dead.\n\n01:19:33.500 --> 01:19:34.500\nThey don't.\n\n01:19:34.500 --> 01:19:38.000\nIt's not about anything other than sort of like hatred.\n\n01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:44.000\nAnd if a person's drowning, Andy, if a person's drowning, sexist or not.\n\n01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:48.000\nAnd I don't know if they don't do it for women.\n\n01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:52.000\nBut they tend to like save drowning humans.\n\n01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:55.000\nLike they see us thrashing around and they're kind of like, what are you doing?\n\n01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000\nShit.\n\n01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:02.000\nAlso, also maybe seals do that possibly too.\n\n01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:06.000\nThat sounded like I just made that up, which I kind of did.\n\n01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:10.000\nI'm basing that off of the documentary, The Bridge, which is about other people jumping\n\n01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:11.000\noff the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\n01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:12.000\nDon't woo that.\n\n01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000\nThe saddest document.\n\n01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:17.000\nSo the director is here.\n\n01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:20.000\nWe captured a lot of suicides on camera.\n\n01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:26.000\nThis one's for the crew, John Perignon.\n\n01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:33.000\nIn that movie, there's one kid who jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge and he's, I mean,\n\n01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:37.000\nmost of the people are not in the documentary talking about their experience jumping off\n\n01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000\nthe Golden Gate Bridge, but he is because he survived.\n\n01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:42.000\nHe broke his whole body hitting the water.\n\n01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000\nAnd by the way.\n\n01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000\nI found God at the end of it.\n\n01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:52.000\nWell, yeah, that was kind of a, yeah, he jumped and he broke his legs and his back and all\n\n01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:53.000\nthis shit in the water.\n\n01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:57.000\nAnd then he was like, he's like, oh my God, I failed to kill myself.\n\n01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:58.000\nI'm now drowning.\n\n01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:02.000\nAnd this thing underneath him kept bumping him and keeping his head above water.\n\n01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:05.000\nAnd he believes it was a seal or he described it to someone.\n\n01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:06.000\nThey said it was a seal.\n\n01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:13.000\nAnd then he goes, and if that's not proof of Jesus, I don't know what it is.\n\n01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:20.000\nWhat a wasted opportunity to become a really passionate marine biologist.\n\n01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:25.000\nI guess he took the easier path.\n\n01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000\nThe human eyes too complicated.\n\n01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:28.000\nFuck it.\n\n01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000\nIntelligent design.\n\n01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000\nMaybe become an optician.\n\n01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000\nDid I say that word right?\n\n01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:35.000\nOkay.\n\n01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:36.000\nAll right.\n\n01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:40.000\nSo dolphins are sexists.\n\n01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000\nJews are great.\n\n01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:43.000\nChristians are great.\n\n01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:46.000\nThey just, they just waste too much time having lock ins.\n\n01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:49.000\nAnd dolphins are Jews.\n\n01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:50.000\nDolphins are.\n\n01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:51.000\nDolphins are Jews.\n\n01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:52.000\nYeah.\n\n01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:53.000\nDolphins are built entirely under water.\n\n01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000\nWe landed on it at some point.\n\n01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:56.000\nDolphins are Jews.\n\n01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000\nDo you not say Muslims are sharks?\n\n01:21:58.000 --> 01:21:59.000\nYeah.\n\n01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000\nBut no, I did not mean to say Muslims are sharks.\n\n01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:02.000\nI don't want to say that.\n\n01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:03.000\nIt sure was.\n\n01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:04.000\nHey, I have one last question.\n\n01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000\nI mean, like literally.\n\n01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:11.000\nYou know how giant squids and killer whales are fighting all the time?\n\n01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:12.000\nNo.\n\n01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:16.000\nLike, look it up.\n\n01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:17.000\nYeah.\n\n01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:18.000\nLook it up.\n\n01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:21.000\nThey know what I'm talking about.\n\n01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:22.000\nYou're talking about.\n\n01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000\nI mean, we all get it.\n\n01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:25.000\nThey fight all the time.\n\n01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:26.000\nYeah.\n\n01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:27.000\nThey fight all the time on the sign fight.\n\n01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:31.000\nNo one's ever seen it, but there's pictures of it.\n\n01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:32.000\nMegasquids.\n\n01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:33.000\nIs Debbie Gibson in the frame?\n\n01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000\nWho are the good guy?\n\n01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:36.000\nWho's the good guy?\n\n01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:37.000\nAnd who's the bad guy in that?\n\n01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:38.000\nBetween a giant squid.\n\n01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:42.000\nBetween a mammal and a fucking ridiculous fish monster?\n\n01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000\nI don't think a shark is a mammal.\n\n01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:45.000\nThey're killer whales.\n\n01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:46.000\nThey're mammals, man.\n\n01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:47.000\nOh, killer whales.\n\n01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:48.000\nYou automatically just...\n\n01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:51.000\nThe sperm whales.\n\n01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:54.000\nThey look like a killer whale, the pictures I've seen.\n\n01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:57.000\nYou're always going to be on a mammal's side.\n\n01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:58.000\nYou always have to be one.\n\n01:22:58.000 --> 01:22:59.000\nYes.\n\n01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:00.000\nWhy?\n\n01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:01.000\nIn a fight.\n\n01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000\nOkay, let me explain this to what he needs to be explained.\n\n01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000\nIt's the opposite of racist.\n\n01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:06.000\nWhat?\n\n01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000\nIt's a human.\n\n01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:12.000\nIf a human is fighting a chimp, side with the human.\n\n01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:13.000\nWait.\n\n01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:17.000\nIf two chimps are fighting, I don't know.\n\n01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000\nI'll get back to you.\n\n01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:22.000\nSide with the bonobo.\n\n01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:26.000\nIf a gorilla and a chimp are fighting, side with the chimp.\n\n01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:32.000\nIf a squid and a whale are fighting, side with the whale.\n\n01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000\nYou can side with your branch of evolution.\n\n01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:39.000\nIf chimps bite your balls off, gorillas do sign language in pet kittens.\n\n01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:40.000\nBut they're fighting.\n\n01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:41.000\nWhat the fuck?\n\n01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:42.000\nOne.\n\n01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:45.000\nAnd your pig gorilla does sign language in pet kittens.\n\n01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:52.000\nI'm sure if they bother to teach others, they catch on.\n\n01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:53.000\nWhat about this?\n\n01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:56.000\nIf a human's fighting a chimp, side with the human thing.\n\n01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:59.000\nI feel like that's misguided in a lot of circumstances.\n\n01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:00.000\nWhat do you mean?\n\n01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:05.000\nI mean, there's a zookeeper looking human, and he's got a pitchfork,\n\n01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:09.000\nand he's fighting with the chimp, and you gotta side with the chimp sometimes.\n\n01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:10.000\nThey're being abused, maybe.\n\n01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:11.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:12.000\nOh, yeah, you're right.\n\n01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:13.000\nYeah, you're right.\n\n01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:16.000\nI mean, if they were dropped in the arena, sure.\n\n01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000\nI mean, all of the humans.\n\n01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:19.000\nYeah.\n\n01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:22.000\nThis was battle war.\n\n01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:26.000\nI guess that's when I was picturing.\n\n01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:30.000\nIs that this situation was happening more organically.\n\n01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:34.000\nLike, maybe in the world's strangest bar.\n\n01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000\nYeah, just like, you don't know.\n\n01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:40.000\nLike, they were playing darts for a while, and then they erupted into, you know,\n\n01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:43.000\nthe chimp's got a broken bottle, and the guy's like saying,\n\n01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:46.000\nI called a cab, and Mike, you always do this.\n\n01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:49.000\nLike, separate them.\n\n01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:53.000\nBut ultimately, like, we gotta be for humans, right?\n\n01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000\nYou're saying we gotta be to the closest to our genetic.\n\n01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:59.000\nYeah, and then once you have your shit together as a species,\n\n01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:03.000\nthen you go, okay, now we'll start dipping and dapping\n\n01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:08.000\nand don't know what's happening among all these other things.\n\n01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000\nNow, if you're in PETA and stuff, you're listening,\n\n01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000\nyou're going, you're fucking insane.\n\n01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000\nYou wouldn't say retarded, probably.\n\n01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:17.000\nBecause if you're in PETA, you're probably more progressive,\n\n01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:20.000\nand your vocabulary is probably not as crass,\n\n01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:24.000\nand my sister's retarded, so fuck you.\n\n01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:31.000\nBut I just mean, like, we gotta, here's what I'm saying.\n\n01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000\nThere's homeless people.\n\n01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000\nFuck giraffes.\n\n01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:38.000\nThat's all I'm saying.\n\n01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:41.000\nUntil there's no homeless people, fuck giraffes.\n\n01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:45.000\nI don't care how long their necks get.\n\n01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:48.000\nThey're just horses with long necks.\n\n01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:52.000\nI don't, I'm not saying Spencer's right.\n\n01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:56.000\nIf you walk into a bar, there's a guy whipping a giraffe.\n\n01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:59.000\nLike, maybe tell your friend with the whip to, like,\n\n01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:02.000\nokay, you've had too many.\n\n01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:03.000\nHe's not worth it.\n\n01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:04.000\nThat's what I'd say.\n\n01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000\nHe's not worth it, Tony.\n\n01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000\nHe's just a giraffe.\n\n01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:11.000\nI don't even know how he got in here.\n\n01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:12.000\nHe must have been lower in.\n\n01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:13.000\nIt's the lowest bar.\n\n01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:16.000\nThis bar has the highest ceiling I've ever been in.\n\n01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:17.000\nAll right.\n\n01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:21.000\nOkay, so we should play, let's, I got my character sheets.\n\n01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:22.000\nSo here's how it works, Paula.\n\n01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:23.000\nYou get these sheets.\n\n01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000\nThey have scribbles all over them.\n\n01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:26.000\nWe were drunk.\n\n01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:27.000\nWe look at them.\n\n01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000\nWe don't know what we're doing.\n\n01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000\nIf you see something on there that's like,\n\n01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000\nit says I have shoes, you can say.\n\n01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:36.000\nSpencer will generally, like, tell you,\n\n01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:39.000\nlike, if you want to do something now, you can do something.\n\n01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:43.000\nSometimes that he forgets, but here it passes.\n\n01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:44.000\nYou're Dignity Sarsgard.\n\n01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000\nYou are a paladin.\n\n01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000\nYou're for truth and justice.\n\n01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:51.000\nAnd you'll probably want to take the top two, Dave,\n\n01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:54.000\nand pass the next to Ryan.\n\n01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:57.000\nI think I messed up the order when the paper was...\n\n01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:58.000\nLook okay to me.\n\n01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000\nJust left hand to Ryan.\n\n01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000\nOkay buddy.\n\n01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:03.000\nIt's like Twister.\n\n01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:04.000\nThanks, Mr.\n\n01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000\nYeah.\n\n01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:09.000\nMaster.\n\n01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:10.000\nWhat?\n\n01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:11.000\nI'm a master.\n\n01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:14.000\nI'll call you, I'll call you master.\n\n01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:15.000\nPlease do.\n\n01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:20.000\nI touched the ice, I touched all the ice.\n\n01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:21.000\nI don't have time to fuck around.\n\n01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:22.000\nI'm touching all the ice.\n\n01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:23.000\nIs that bad to touch the ice?\n\n01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000\nOh yeah, it's unhygienic.\n\n01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:28.000\nI mean, the alcohol take care of that probably, right?\n\n01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:29.000\nYeah.\n\n01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000\nI don't know if that's scientifically accurate.\n\n01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:32.000\nIt sounds good though.\n\n01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:35.000\nI don't think I'm going to get music probably,\n\n01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:36.000\nbut I should...\n\n01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:37.000\nOh shit!\n\n01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000\nWell, I mean, you...\n\n01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:40.000\nWhatever.\n\n01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000\nI touched all the ice.\n\n01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000\nI took all the ice.\n\n01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:47.000\nI don't know if these guys are ready.\n\n01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:48.000\nOh, we could use some ice.\n\n01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:49.000\nDance in a round.\n\n01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:50.000\nIf I've learned anything,\n\n01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000\nedit this part out, let us get our drinks.\n\n01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:55.000\nThat's what I was thinking.\n\n01:27:55.000 --> 01:28:00.000\nSo, do you guys see that sports thing?\n\n01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:01.000\nTwo points, right?\n\n01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:02.000\nTwo points.\n\n01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000\nI didn't think they were going to get those points,\n\n01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:05.000\nbut then...\n\n01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:06.000\nTwo of them.\n\n01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:07.000\nRight there.\n\n01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:08.000\nPlain as day.\n\n01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:09.000\nOh man.\n\n01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:10.000\nThis is like a sports corner.\n\n01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000\nI'm stealing your bit, Harmon.\n\n01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:13.000\nSteal it.\n\n01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:17.000\nThis is the least enthusiastic sports corner.\n\n01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:18.000\nHit it.\n\n01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:19.000\nAlright.\n\n01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:20.000\nSo, are we good then?\n\n01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:21.000\nI mean...\n\n01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:22.000\nYep.\n\n01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:23.000\nAre we all...\n\n01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000\nLet me turn on my iPad.\n\n01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000\nI don't know what the fuck's wrong with me, you guys.\n\n01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:28.000\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:29.000\nWell, you're high or sick.\n\n01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:30.000\nI'm just sick.\n\n01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:35.000\nI always cool off by 937.\n\n01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:38.000\nLast time on Harmontown.\n\n01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:41.000\nOur heroes had reunited outside\n\n01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:45.000\nafter leaving Father Tinder to inform Mrs. Darmvahn\n\n01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:48.000\nof her husband's untimely demise.\n\n01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:52.000\nThe gang was approached by Spizwad, the gnome.\n\n01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:53.000\nAnd the gnome.\n\n01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:54.000\nOh yes, Spizzbulb.\n\n01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:57.000\nAnd the gnome offered them a place to stay.\n\n01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000\nUp in his tower.\n\n01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:02.000\nAnd the group decided they needed to take...\n\n01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000\nThere, the group decided that they needed to break\n\n01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000\ninto Father's Tinder's house.\n\n01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:07.000\nJesus Christ.\n\n01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:10.000\nTo look for clues and steal his stuff.\n\n01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:14.000\nSpizzbulb gave them a bundle of cloth and they departed.\n\n01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:17.000\nWhile infiltrating the house, Quark heard a noise\n\n01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:20.000\nand rushed upstairs to see a small ninja\n\n01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000\nattacking Father Tinder before escaping.\n\n01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:25.000\nAfter tripping and falling on his blade,\n\n01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:28.000\ntrying to apprehend the assailant, Quark was pissed.\n\n01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:31.000\nAnd sexually assaulted the beaten, bloody old priest\n\n01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000\nwhile Sharpie gave chase.\n\n01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000\nPursuing the assassin.\n\n01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000\nDignity Sarsgard heard the commotion\n\n01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000\nand discovered Quark's sodomy.\n\n01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:42.000\nRemoving the raging barbarian and locking him in a closet.\n\n01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:45.000\nSharpie tracked the ninja to Darvon's house\n\n01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000\nwhich was ruined by magic.\n\n01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000\nInside he cornered the offender\n\n01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000\nwho revealed himself to be Spizzbulb,\n\n01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000\nthe friendly gnome from before.\n\n01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:54.000\nUnbelievable.\n\n01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000\nSharpie attacked.\n\n01:29:56.000 --> 01:30:00.000\nBut Spizzbulb seemed to avoid all harm with a magical barrier.\n\n01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000\nSharpie was outmatched.\n\n01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:05.000\nAs dignity ran off to aid our heroes,\n\n01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:09.000\nQuark stewed swearing revenge on the paladin who stopped him.\n\n01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000\nBut could our heroes pull it together\n\n01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:14.000\nto fight off a super-powered Spizzbulb?\n\n01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:17.000\nOr would they all perish alone?\n\n01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:18.000\nLike me.\n\n01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:19.000\nFind out.\n\n01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000\nLike you, Harmonytown.\n\n01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000\nWhat? Oh my God.\n\n01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000\nWhat the hell was that?\n\n01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000\nIt just did a...\n\n01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000\nSome Hunter S. Thompson...\n\n01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000\nan introduction.\n\n01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:34.000\nIt sounded like it went with the music.\n\n01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:37.000\nIt slipped a little tragedy in there.\n\n01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000\nJesus.\n\n01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000\nI don't know if we can play.\n\n01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000\nIt's gonna take you somewhere quiet.\n\n01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000\nI'll just role-play up some happiness.\n\n01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:50.000\nYeah, so I saw our friend Spizzbulb.\n\n01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000\nI was trying to chase him,\n\n01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:55.000\nbut then I came across frozen people or something.\n\n01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:58.000\nYeah, they were frozen in this like hunk of force magic.\n\n01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000\nAre we all together again?\n\n01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000\nThe characters, the players?\n\n01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000\nYou guys are racing.\n\n01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000\nYou're

01:31:12.000\nYou're in this guy...\n\n01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000\nNo, you're in the bottom floor.\n\n01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000\nSorry, I have a two-story house.\n\n01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000\nThere's this guy.\n\n01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000\nHe's a little gnome wearing Ninja gear going...\n\n01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:25.000\nAnd he's just menacing.\n\n01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000\nAnd he's facing down Sharpie,\n\n01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000\nand he looks like he's got the upper hand.\n\n01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000\nSharpie's running towards you guys\n\n01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000\nand you enter this room.\n\n01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000\nYou don't know what's going on.\n\n01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000\nThat's a...\n\n01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000\nSo I had to...\n\n01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000\nYou fill them in as they're seeing what's happening.\n\n01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000\nSpizzbulb...\n\n01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000\nIt

to investigate\n\n01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:00.000\nbecause he was too into juice.\n\n01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000\nYou remember?\n\n01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000\nThere's a guy who's like the mayor of the town\n\n01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000\nwho was like really into juice\n\n01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000\nand we talked to him a lot about juice\n\n01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000\nand then we were suspicious of him.\n\n01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:14.000\nSo we did a stealth operation at his house\n\n01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000\nto see if we could find out more about him,\n\n01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000\nbut we found him getting killed.\n\n01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000\nHe wasn't dead though, he's still alive.\n\n01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000\nIs he here?\n\n01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000\nHe's back at his place.\n\n01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000\nAlright, back to Father Tinders.\n\n01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000\nYou're running away?\n\n01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000\nIs Spizzbulb still here?\n\n01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000\nSpizzbulb, why?\n\n01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000\nBecause I'm fucked up.\n\n01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000\nYou never trust a gnome.\n\n01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000\nGnomes are all evil.\n\n01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000\nI deny it,\n\n01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000\nbut the way Jeff acted last week...\n\n01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000\nThat's racist.\n\n01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000\nI say it.\n\n01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000\nNo.\n\n01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000\nWait, I'm a gnome?\n\n01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000\nYeah, you're a gnome.\n\n01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000\nFuck that.\n\n01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000\nYeah, keep going.\n\n01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000\nI'm good.\n\n01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000\nAre gnomes like the dolphins\n\n01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000\nor the sharks in this game?\n\n01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000\nSomeone said sharks.\n\n01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000\nAre all gnomes like ninjas?\n\n01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000\nNo, some are.\n\n01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000\nSome are.\n\n01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:26.000\nSome are like humans.\n\n01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000\nYou know?\n\n01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000\nBut he's like, you guys are gonna die!\n\n01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000\nWhy?\n\n01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000\nHe starts casting magics.\n\n01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000\nGod damn it.\n\n01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000\nI feel deja vu here.\n\n01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000\nDidn't I teleport to behind him?\n\n01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000\nYou tried to fear him.\n\n01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000\nHe didn't get feared.\n\n01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000\nThen you started running away.\n\n01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000\nThen your friends showed up.\n\n01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000\nCan I teleport to behind him again?\n\n01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000\nAlright, well I want to shock and grasp him\n\n01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000\nbefore he manages to cast whatever he's casting.\n\n01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000\nAlright, well, that doesn't happen.\n\n01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000\nHe manages to cast whatever he's casting.\n\n01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000\nFuck.\n\n01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000\nSo he waves his arms magically\n\n01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000\nand you see four shining pillars\n\n01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000\nof force, energy\n\n01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000\nlooking kind of like great columns\n\n01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000\nalmost as large and as heavy as stone pillars.\n\n01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000\nAnd they launch\n\n01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000\ntowards you kind of slowly.\n\n01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000\nThey're easy to dodge,\n\n01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:20.000\nbut let's see if you do.\n\n01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:24.000\nYou do.\n\n01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000\nI dodged.\n\n01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000\nYeah, the slow
