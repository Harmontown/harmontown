00:00.000 --> 00:20.000
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Harmontown!

00:20.000 --> 00:37.000
Hi, I'm your guest Comptroller Ryan Ridley, and please welcome to the stage the Mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon!

00:37.000 --> 00:43.000
Thank you. Comptroller Ridley, thank you. Pleasure to have you here.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
Thank you for having me.

00:45.000 --> 00:55.000
Alright, thank you for the Sugar Cubes song. We were just talking about the Sugar Cubes. That's why you didn't want me to know what you were playing. It was a surprise.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
It's very nice. You're a very intimate friend.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
It's a callback.

01:00.000 --> 01:04.000
I have high hopes for you tonight. I think you're going to control very well.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
I'm feeling nervous right now, but I appreciate it.

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
What's the worst thing that you think you might do?

01:10.000 --> 01:14.000
Say something that I think is going to be funny and that it's not funny.

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
What's the funniest thing you could think of right now?

01:17.000 --> 01:21.000
Let's just live through the nightmare.

01:21.000 --> 01:26.000
What's the funniest thing about pickles that you could even think of?

01:26.000 --> 01:30.000
Oh my God. Well, now I have to ad-lib something? Jesus.

01:30.000 --> 01:34.000
I'll do a reverse improvised knock-knock joke. Who's there?

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
Knock-knock!

01:36.000 --> 01:40.000
Who's there, goddammit? It better be Pickle.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
I've been waiting for a pickle.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
Who's there?

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
It's a stork.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
The stork from the pickles?

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:52.000 --> 01:56.000
Yeah. Well, why are you here at my door?

01:56.000 --> 02:00.000
Who are you? Stork who?

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
I don't know. Blasic? Mr. Blasic? Is that his name?

02:03.000 --> 02:07.000
Well, come on in. Come in.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
How are you?

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
I'm great.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
I ordered pickles. I didn't know the stork would come.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
Come on, man.

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
Sit down. I was just watching The Wire.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
What's it about?

02:18.000 --> 02:22.000
Crime.

02:22.000 --> 02:26.000
Not pickles or babies. I don't know if that's a stereotype.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
We sell pickles on corners where I come from.

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
You're familiar with the concept of controlling a corner, owning a corner.

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
These guys do that in The Wire.

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
Let's keep watching. Six hours later.

02:39.000 --> 02:44.000
Why are they focusing on the stevedores so much this season?

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
I miss Stringer Bell.

02:48.000 --> 02:52.000
I guess they're trying to prove, obviously, the case, which is they're very good writers.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
They're not drug dealer-dependent.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
Four hours later.

02:57.000 --> 03:03.000
Fucking Stringer Bells back. Yeah. They caved.

03:03.000 --> 03:08.000
Five hours later. That was a good finale.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
I'm going to try to emulate that for Season 3 of Community.

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
A year and a half later. Fuck!

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
Shit. Fucked it.

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
Why is it trying to emulate The Wire on a sitcom?

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
All right. So I got some bones to pick.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
See, how did it feel?

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
It was shaking, man.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
But now you know nothing can harm you.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
Listen to these guys.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
You'll do the heavy lifting.

03:33.000 --> 03:37.000
I got some bones to pick. Oh, hi, Entie.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
Oh, Entie's back.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
What? It's Entie's birthday?

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
Oh, we'll do something special for Entie's birthday.

03:44.000 --> 03:50.000
I hope you wanted for your birthday me picking pop cultural bones.

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
That's the name of our segment.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
Ryan doesn't have an iPad or anything.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
So there's no...

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
I can't improvise jingles. I told you that.

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
I want your girlfriend to come and play violin for the segment.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
She didn't bring her violin.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
Ryan's girlfriend's a violinist.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
She's like an accomplished violinist.

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
She's like, third fourth chair.

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
And it goes by DEF CON, so that's better than first chair.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
First chair violin, you're in trouble.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
It means war is about to happen.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
You don't want to be that.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
Fourth fourth chair is good.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
They still call it a fiddle at fourth chair.

04:26.000 --> 04:30.000
And then it becomes slowly you work your way to a violin.

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
And then you jump forward to the timpani.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
I went to a...

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
Ben Folds was at the Hollywood Bowl,

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
and I was wondering why he works really well with these orchestras and stuff.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
And there's this guy...

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
I mean, I really want to talk about the...

04:44.000 --> 04:48.000
Yeah, the 30 questions I have for the cymbal guy.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
I was watching him all night, because I was like,

04:50.000 --> 04:56.000
man, is he... I'm sure your girlfriend could answer these questions.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
She's right there, by the way.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
Yeah, well, I don't like to look at her.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
I'm very uncomfortable around women and musicians,

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
so she's double trouble for me.

05:07.000 --> 05:13.000
But Mia, are you capable of answering questions in front of a crowd about...

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
Okay, okay, no, no.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
Alright, I won't put you in a spot, though.

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
But it's like the guy, he sits in back,

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
and then I was just watching him, and he's got that...

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
He sits there in silence for a while, he's reading the music along with it,

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
and he's like, yeah, no cymbals on this page.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
And then he turns the page, and you can see him start to...

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
He gets up, super professional.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
I mean, he's in the LA Philharmonic, but he just plays the cymbals.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
So it's like, is he...

05:39.000 --> 05:43.000
When he goes home, is he like a massive drummer?

05:43.000 --> 05:48.000
And he's like, well, fucking the LA Phil is, you know, hard to get into,

05:48.000 --> 05:54.000
so I'm honored to play just one part of the drum kit for such a prestigious band.

05:54.000 --> 05:58.000
But come see me tonight with Fuckface at Space Land.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
And I will shred those fucking skins, man.

06:01.000 --> 06:06.000
And he's just sitting there like, I hope my fucking conductor's in the audience.

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
And then he, like, the night that his conductor comes,

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
he does a whole, like, fucking drum fill.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
And then he hovers his stick over a cymbal, and then he drops it.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
And he goes like, it's more to it than that mic.

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
And mic's like, I just conduct, I don't write the fucking...

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
What do you want, a cymbal symphony?

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
You want me to write like a concerto for a cymbal?

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
Cymbal?

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
It's the Orbiture.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
All right.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
Thank you for clapping.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
The president of the Lost Cause Department.

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
All right, so here's my bone I wanted to pick.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
All right.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
So I think that enough time has passed now to talk about this,

06:56.000 --> 06:59.000
and I don't think I'm going to talk about it insensitively.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
Uh-oh.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
I don't know what else.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
Don't you think it was a little weird,

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
I think thoughtful, but weird,

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
when Princess Diana died,

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
and Elton John just said,

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
oh, this song's about her too.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
His Marilyn Monroe song,

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
that's like literally in the song,

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
he's like, your name was Norma Jean,

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
and you changed it to Marilyn Monroe,

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
and this is a song about you.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
And then Princess Diana died,

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
and he's like, also Princess Diana,

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
you were also a candle in the wind.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
It's not, we didn't start the fire.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
That covers everything.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
Yeah, he didn't want that.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
See, Billy Joel did.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
Yeah, he thought ahead.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
Yeah.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
But he probably didn't like Princess Diana.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
He was probably like, good.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
She did start the fire.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
I'm just going to add her death to my next song.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
Nuclear war and Mario Kart,

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
Princess Diana.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
He's just like, fucking,

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
I'm just going to make some history about me.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
I'm Billy Joel.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
But Elton John, I don't know,

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
was that a cool move to be like,

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
also, it's also about you.

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
And also the song itself,

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
even when it was just about Marilyn Monroe,

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
this isn't a rhetorical question,

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
just like, if I'm wrong, I'm wrong.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
Isn't it kind of a dick move

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
to have your whole song be,

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
like, he's like, he's like,

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
I didn't know you.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
I was too young.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
You're old and you're dead.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
And then also, like,

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
your candle blew out long before

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
your legend ever did.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
Well, of course it,

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
what the fuck are you talking about?

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
Why is that even a remarkable thing to say?

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
Also, it's kind of rubbing your face.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
Like, you're a corpse now,

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
but people heard of you.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
Wow.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
Like, you have that in common

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
with Attila the Hun.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
I'm sure Marilyn Monroe's zombie

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
would be like, yeah,

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
but I'd rather be alive.

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
I'd rather my candle not have burnt out.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
Like, who are you?

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
I don't know, I'm too young.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
The bitch is back.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
He's not even that young.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
He's like, I think it was just a song

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
about how he's just like,

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
he's just like, I look how young I was.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
I was just a kid when Marilyn Monroe died.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
Don't brag about that.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
And then Princess died, dies,

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
and he's like, guess what?

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
Write a new song!

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
Alright, obviously you guys disagree,

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
or are 25.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
Fine.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
I really thought,

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
remember when I said I got something juicy

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
to talk about?

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
I couldn't wait.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
How sad is it that that was it?

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
I'm not going to tell you

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
because I want your real reactions.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
You're just sitting there,

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
which is fine.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
I don't want you to start thinking

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
that you have a job.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
Like, am I supposed to be talking more?

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
Keep looking at me.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
No, no, no.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
Should I?

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
Jeff, probably?

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
No?

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
I got nothing.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
What happened?

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
Did somebody just vape?

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
There was a puff of smoke that went up.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
Maybe something started on fire.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
Sorry.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
Okay, so

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
these are all secondary to that topic.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
These are all less interesting.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
I think I'm going to like this one better.

10:16.000 --> 10:23.000
I got picked up from the airport once.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
Jeff, be sarcastic.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
I get it.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
You don't know who Elton John is.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
Maybe you guys should write a song about it.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
Goodbye, Elton John.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
We were too young to know

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
who you were too young to be singing about

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
when you sang about being too young

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
to know somebody that died.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
It seems to me you lived your life

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
making one song about multiple people,

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
never knowing which dead person

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
to ride the coattails of.

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
I would have liked to be mad about it,

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
but I was just a kid when you were irrelevant.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
That song was already annoying

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
before everyone else died

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
that you made it about.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
All right.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
So I got picked up from the airport

11:13.000 --> 11:18.000
and I always ask a driver,

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
so I like to make small talk,

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
and I know what the drivers like to talk about.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
I always ask them,

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
who's the most famous person?

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
Or just name it.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
Like, who's not even the most famous person?

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
Just tell me something that's stuck out

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
that drove in your car.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
You know, it's like a car guy.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
You know, they drive people.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
They're in LA.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
Definitely.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
Sometimes you hear,

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
oh, Alan Aldo was a really nice guy.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
Bruce Willis was mean to me or something like that.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
It's kind of fun.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
This guy said,

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
he said, well,

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
I picked up a guy named D.L. Hughley.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
You know him,

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
and I said, I've heard of D.L. Hughley.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
I know who that is.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
And he said, yeah,

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
he wanted the red door service.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
Uh-oh.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
And I was like,

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
what's red door service?

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
He's like, you know,

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
there's a, if you're famous,

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
there's a red door at LAX

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
you can be taken to.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
It's like a VIP door?

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
I guess that's why you never see Harrison Ford

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
like getting frisked at the airport.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
He doesn't just have a private jet.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
I saw Frank Langella once.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
Yeah.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
He's like purple door.

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
Uh, but, but like,

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
I guess there's a red door.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
I don't know.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
Did he tell you more about it?

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
What does it look like?

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
He said, I pulled him up to a thing

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
and it was like a red door.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
It was red?

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
Yes.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
He said,

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
I pulled him up to a thing

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
and it was like a red door.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
Yes.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
That part.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
Okay.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
I don't remember that part of the conversation.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
I just want to know,

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
you know,

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
what's up with the red door?

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
I told you it was worse than the thing.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
All right.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
So, uh,

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
Yeah.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
I had a barbecue today

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
saying goodbye to my assistant,

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
Daniella,

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
who's moving on to be a mother.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
Yeah.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
You know,

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
No,

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
I already hired a new assistant.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
I'm sorry.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
I mean,

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
I get to pick,

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
I creme de la creme, man.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
I'm talking to people like,

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
yeah,

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
I used to roll joints for so-and-so.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
I'm like,

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
okay,

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
I took Rennie Harlan's dog to the vet.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
I'm like,

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
yeah,

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
well,

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
what have you done for me lately?

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
Uh,

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
yeah,

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
I'm picking from the pros.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
Okay.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
So,

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
not that you,

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
sir,

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
are not.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
Not that

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
the assistant Rennie Harlan

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
would chop your,

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
make you better.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
Um,

13:37.000 --> 13:41.000
so I had a goodbye party for her.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
Yeah.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
And there were balloons.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
We got a tank of helium.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
Oh.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
And I said,

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
I can see where this is going.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
And I saw,

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
and I saw this big helium tank.

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
It looks exactly like a propane tank.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
And I,

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
and Aaron was like,

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
can you put that over there?

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
And I was like,

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
fuck man,

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
my back,

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
this is going to be a bummer.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
Um,

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
and I went and picked it up.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
Tanks of helium are very light.

14:05.000 --> 14:09.000
It's like a metal tank

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
filled with something lighter than air.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
And I was like,

14:13.000 --> 14:16.000
I was so overjoyed by that.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
This is like a joke.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
It's like a cartoon.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
Like the tank,

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
the tank is light.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
Does it technically make it lighter than the tank

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
if it was empty?

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
Your name?

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
I would think so.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
Cause it's,

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
it's lighter than air.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
That's why balloons float.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
Yeah.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
It's lighter than air.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
Right.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
If you put enough helium into,

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
I guess a thin enough tank.

14:34.000 --> 14:38.000
You could fly.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
It's,

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
it's a dirigible, right?

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
It's a,

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
yeah.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
I don't,

14:44.000 --> 14:47.000
tanks of helium are lighter.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
You guys should have,

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
you guys should have been more into the candle.

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
What's in a blimp?

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
I could have done it 30 minutes on it,

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
but you were,

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
you know,

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
I had a sandbar with you

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
and I moved on.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
I moved on to shit.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
You deserved it.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
What's in a blimp?

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
What's in a blimp?

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
Yeah.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
Hydrogen?

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
Yeah.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
Hydrogen?

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
Yeah.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
Helium?

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
Really?

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
Well,

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
now helium,

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
but hydrogen when it blew up,

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
the,

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
the,

15:14.000 --> 15:15.000
oh,

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
the humanity one,

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
Hindenburg.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
You know,

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
a lot of people survived the Hindenburg

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
cause they just jumped off.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
Yeah.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
Close enough for the ground.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
It wasn't that high up.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
Yeah.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
I'm sure they were like,

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
fuck.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
And not that many people died either.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
Yeah.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
Yeah.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
The guy was being a drama queen.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
The,

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
the,

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
the guy said,

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
oh,

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
the blimpery.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
Oh,

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
the overhead.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
Oh,

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
the insurance paperwork.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
This is going to be a week of tough work.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
Loids of London.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.000
I mean,

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
the thing that everybody fantasizes about

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
with the plane crash,

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
people actually did on the Hindenburg.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
Like,

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
I can just jump off.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
Yeah.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
Yeah.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
Yeah.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
They hurt themselves.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
But those 16 people were probably like,

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
kind of cooler,

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
more confident people.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
Yeah.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
Yeah.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
Yeah.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
Yeah.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
Yeah.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
Yeah.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
They were more confident people.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
Like they,

16:03.000 --> 16:06.000
they looked up and saw an entire blimp

16:06.000 --> 16:09.000
burning up the entire thing.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
And they were like,

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
I, you know,

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
they wouldn't let us on this thing

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
if they didn't know what they were doing.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
I'm going to,

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
I'm going to hang out.

16:18.000 --> 16:21.000
That's the part of the blimp that no one uses.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
It's a bunch of hydrogen.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
I'm going to,

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
I'm going to,

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
I'm going to,

16:26.000 --> 16:27.000
you know,

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
people panic too much.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
Those are the 16 people.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
The other people were like,

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
that's 50 feet.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
I can make it.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
Yeah.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
Yeah.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
Yeah.

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
So Ryan is a half Irish,

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
half Jewish.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
I'm not half Irish.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
First of all.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
But I'm half not Jewish,

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
is what you're trying to say.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
So what's the half that's not Jewish?

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
Is that Irish?

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
No, it's English, German.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
Other stuff.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
That's close to Irish.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
Yeah.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
Ridley, Ridley.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
Yeah.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
Oh, Ryan Ridley.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
Yeah.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
Yeah.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
I suppose you'd like a taste of me magic.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
Yeah.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
Popcorn.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
If I was half Irish,

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
and I wouldn't focus on the Jewish part so much.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
Right.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
Because Irish competes with that identity.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
Right.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
It kind of evens you out.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
Yeah.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
I'm nothing.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
I'm like a bunch of random other European.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
Yeah.

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
Yeah.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
Well, that kind of kills my, yeah.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
I was thinking.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
You're not.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
I mean,

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
your bit that you told,

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
you're not Irish, right?

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
I'm like half Irish,

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
half Polish,

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
half Cherokee.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
For the point of your bit,

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
you can do Jewish and...

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
I don't know.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
My bit was kind of,

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
my bit was a bit.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
Like the idea that it was a bit was a bit.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
Uh-huh.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
Well, we could do,

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
we could realize your nightmare of doing a bad bit.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
Like,

17:43.000 --> 17:44.000
I had this idea.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
Well, it sounds like I don't have to do anything.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
Ryan is,

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
Ryan is half Jewish, half Irish.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
I could,

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
to the extent that that's true,

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
I'm fully Irish.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
And,

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
and then we have our friend Dave Horowitz,

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
who I think is full blown to.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
Like tilt,

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
full tilt.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
Yeah.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
Like,

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
actually seven,

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
seven points on his star of David.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
Uh,

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
there's just an extra one there for,

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
just,

18:12.000 --> 18:13.000
just for safety.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
Yeah.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
Uh,

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
and I thought the joke would be,

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
this is the hackiest,

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
I,

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
I thought,

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
that you,

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
that we,

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
we would have him stand on one side

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
and me stand on the other.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
And we,

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
we would get questions,

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
uh,

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
hit you with scenarios

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
and then we would give you advice from each side.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
Yeah.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
And,

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
it doesn't,

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
it's like,

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
once you explain that bit,

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
it's over.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.000
Like,

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
like doing it isn't,

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
isn't,

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
it doesn't,

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
it doesn't really work.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
I mean,

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
that depends on you guys.

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
Yeah.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
If you come up with really funny answers.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
Like,

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
let's just do the most obvious,

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
like Dave Horowitz,

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
can you come up?

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
Uh,

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
are you here?

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
Oh,

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
okay,

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
all right.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
A full Jew.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
Yeah.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
Full Jew.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
100%.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
Yeah.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
Uh,

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
so,

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
yeah,

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
give us,

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
get,

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
what's your curriculum vitae,

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
like,

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
uh,

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
how Jewish,

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
like,

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
like,

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
like,

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
just prove your,

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
like,

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
what do you,

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
you're not just,

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
you're,

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
you're really Jewish.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
I mean,

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
uh,

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
I'd say like,

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
um,

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
maybe like,

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
this is exclusively so very Jewish.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
Could be Italian.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
Yeah.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
Well,

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
TV writer.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
Right.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
Okay.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
There,

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
that tilts it over the edge.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
They're really,

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
they're no Italian TV writers.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
Yeah.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
Also,

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
you can't see,

19:37.000 --> 19:38.000
but like,

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
I'd say like,

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
the most Jewish is from

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
nose to,

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
like,

19:42.000 --> 19:43.000
this is the most Jewish.

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
Have you ever seen a more Jewish thing

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
than this nose and these eyebrows?

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
It's a very bad podcast bit,

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
but

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
Google,

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
Google image search me right now,

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
and you'll see.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.000
He's pointing at,

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
like,

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
you know,

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
but you pull it off.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
You're a handsome man.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
But like,

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
if Eugene Levy was in like,

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
maybe like,

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
a band,

19:59.000 --> 20:02.000
you know what I mean?

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
It's Silver Lake.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
Yeah.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
Yeah.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
And they were doing kind of well,

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
like,

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
you know,

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
maybe like,

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
they were being scouted.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
They weren't signed,

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
but like,

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
an indie label was maybe interested

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
in Eugene Levy's bands.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
Right.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
Uh,

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
all right.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
So let's just try this hack bit.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
Okay.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
So,

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
Ryan,

20:21.000 --> 20:22.000
someone,

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
someone,

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
someone asked,

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
wait,

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
how does it work if we,

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
someone,

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
someone,

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
someone,

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
someone,

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
uh,

20:31.000 --> 20:34.000
someone name a situation for,

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
for Ryan,

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
a topic,

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
a topic.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
Condoms.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
Condoms?

20:39.000 --> 20:40.000
Okay.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.000
Condoms.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
Okay.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
All right.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
So Ryan,

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
the topic is condoms.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.000
All right.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
I got it.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
I got it.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
All right.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
Okay.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
All right.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
Listen,

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
I,

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
I met my place with a woman,

20:55.000 --> 20:56.000
just brought her home,

20:56.000 --> 20:57.000
don't know her,

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
met her at the bar.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
What?

20:59.000 --> 21:00.000
Yeah.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
Listen,

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
trust me,

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
trust me.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
Wait,

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
how did it go down?

21:05.000 --> 21:06.000
Hold on.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
What did you say?

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
What did you say to her

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
to get her back to your place?

21:09.000 --> 21:10.000
I had some moves.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
What,

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
game one of them.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
Well,

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
I mean,

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
what would,

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
what would an Irish person say?

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
Did,

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
did you write her a poem?

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
Yeah.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
Yeah.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
Why don't I just,

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
it's the worst bit ever.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
It's just the worst.

21:24.000 --> 21:28.000
I'm kind of enjoying how bad it is.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
I've got a real question.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
A Jewish person might say like,

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
hey,

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
I have that Woody Allen PBS documentary,

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
DVR,

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
if you want to watch the first part of it,

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
maybe we'll get to the second part,

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
unless we get distracted.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
And then you do that.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
Man.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
The first part's like two hours.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
Yeah.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
You got to ease into it.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
You got to wait until the first hour is over

21:47.000 --> 21:48.000
to put your arm over it.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
Uh-huh.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
Yeah.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
And,

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
if I was Irish,

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
what should I do to take home some bar skis?

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
I guess it's the,

21:55.000 --> 21:56.000
scenario.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
She can be a nice girl.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
That's what she would say.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
A Jewish day.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
An Irish guy.

22:02.000 --> 22:07.000
She can be a nice girl, Ryan.

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
I,

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
I think you should,

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
just take her down to the,

22:12.000 --> 22:17.000
the ocean and,

22:17.000 --> 22:22.000
watch it not compromise,

22:22.000 --> 22:25.000
rub two lumps of coal together,

22:25.000 --> 22:28.000
to symbolize the,

22:28.000 --> 22:31.000
unmitigated freedom.

22:31.000 --> 22:32.000
Uh,

22:32.000 --> 22:33.000
should I use a condom?

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
I guess it's the,

22:35.000 --> 22:36.000
no,

22:36.000 --> 22:41.000
you've got to make more Irish children to,

22:41.000 --> 22:44.000
a Jewish person would tell you to wear like,

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
the tight,

22:45.000 --> 22:46.000
like wear two.

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
Step three.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
Yeah.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
And have her wear one.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
Any diseases there are?

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
Have her be in another room when you're having sex.

22:52.000 --> 22:55.000
You can never be too safe, honey.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
What?

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
I'm definitely more Jewish.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.000
Yeah.

22:59.000 --> 23:00.000
Well you,

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
I was with you when you,

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
when you jude out.

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
You,

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
Yeah.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
Is that an acceptable phrase?

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
I don't know.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
What else could you call it?

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
Uh,

23:11.000 --> 23:12.000
I was,

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
I used to talk to,

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
I was,

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
when we were back in the early 2000s,

23:16.000 --> 23:17.000
like when you,

23:17.000 --> 23:18.000
you were like,

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
I started to watch you start to become increasingly Jewish.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
Like it was like,

23:21.000 --> 23:22.000
you were,

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
you were like,

23:23.000 --> 23:24.000
Eric Stoltz and the fly too.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
You know,

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
like you were a normal kid and then you were like,

23:27.000 --> 23:30.000
you started climbing the walls a little bit.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.000
Wait,

23:31.000 --> 23:32.000
what,

23:32.000 --> 23:33.000
how did the transformation start?

23:33.000 --> 23:36.000
I think you just started going to Shule a lot.

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
Yeah.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
It's true.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
And,

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
Yeah.

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
Like,

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
and I,

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
I was always fascinated with mythology and,

23:44.000 --> 23:45.000
uh,

23:45.000 --> 23:46.000
you know,

23:46.000 --> 23:47.000
uh,

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
Judeo-Christian mythology in particular.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
We had a lot of interesting provocative conversations.

23:50.000 --> 23:51.000
Yeah.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.000
Uh,

23:52.000 --> 23:53.000
you know,

23:53.000 --> 23:54.000
uh,

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
whether the sequel holds up and stuff and,

23:56.000 --> 23:57.000
uh,

23:57.000 --> 23:58.000
and then you,

23:58.000 --> 23:59.000
and then you're like,

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
I'm going to Israel and I'm like,

24:01.000 --> 24:06.000
See you when you get back.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
You didn't like that?

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
It's like going to the Disneyland of mythology.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
I,

24:11.000 --> 24:15.000
I rode the rides, man.

24:15.000 --> 24:19.000
You have to be this high to wail at this wall.

24:19.000 --> 24:22.000
We can't.

24:22.000 --> 24:23.000
Uh,

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
the,

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
uh,

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
yeah,

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
I don't know.

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
I was just losing a friend.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
I don't know.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
I can't,

24:30.000 --> 24:31.000
I can't do long distance relationships.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
I'm not going to Skype with you with your little beard

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
and your tassels or whatever.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
Well,

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
you did.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
I do.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
Well,

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
I had you send a recording.

24:39.000 --> 24:42.000
I pretended it was a Skype conversation in a video.

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
Yeah.

24:43.000 --> 24:44.000
Yeah.

24:44.000 --> 24:45.000
Did you grow a beard?

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
Fuck yeah.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
He had a fight.

24:47.000 --> 24:48.000
He looked like fucking,

24:48.000 --> 24:49.000
it's amazing.

24:49.000 --> 24:50.000
Like,

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
like it's,

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
it's like,

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
I guess it is like a thing.

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
Like,

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
like you could just like,

24:55.000 --> 24:58.000
it just grows when you step off the plane.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
Like when you get on things really soiled.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.000
When you see like a,

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
like an Orthodox,

25:02.000 --> 25:03.000
is that the right term?

25:03.000 --> 25:04.000
An Orthodox Jew,

25:04.000 --> 25:05.000
like,

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
like,

25:06.000 --> 25:07.000
you know,

25:07.000 --> 25:08.000
walking in that neighborhood in LA,

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
like,

25:09.000 --> 25:10.000
can you see the Indiana Jones hat and the like beard

25:10.000 --> 25:11.000
and the,

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
and the,

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
and the witness homage suit,

25:13.000 --> 25:14.000
you know,

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
the,

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
the,

25:16.000 --> 25:17.000
you always go like,

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
wow,

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
that's such an alien weird thing.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
But my friend went over to Israel and he just like,

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
he got on this Skype thing and it was like,

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
he looked like,

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
he wasn't doing a bit.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
Like it wasn't like a prop beard.

25:28.000 --> 25:29.000
Like,

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
that is just what,

25:30.000 --> 25:33.000
what anyone can look like if they spent enough time.

25:33.000 --> 25:34.000
I had the beard was real.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.000
And I think I threw on a jacket.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
Cause I brought a suit,

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
but I mean,

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
I found that hat just laying around.

25:39.000 --> 25:40.000
Literally.

25:40.000 --> 25:41.000
Like I was like,

25:41.000 --> 25:42.000
Oh, there's seven of them.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
Okay.

25:43.000 --> 25:44.000
This one fits.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
I don't,

25:45.000 --> 25:46.000
I didn't have one of the Indiana Jones hats.

25:46.000 --> 25:47.000
They're blowing down the streets.

25:47.000 --> 25:48.000
Yeah.

25:48.000 --> 25:49.000
Yeah.

25:49.000 --> 25:50.000
I've,

25:50.000 --> 25:51.000
I've never been to Israel,

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
but I'm pretty sure that they like,

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
pull some kind of weird,

25:55.000 --> 25:58.000
like mystical voodoo on you to make,

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
to like,

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
basically make you grow the beard.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
Like my brother went on birthright,

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
which is like a free trip you can go on

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
up till I think 26.

26:06.000 --> 26:09.000
And he wasn't religious at all.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.000
And he called,

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
I feel so bad for him cause he got swindled

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
cause he's such a sweetheart.

26:14.000 --> 26:15.000
But he called me,

26:15.000 --> 26:18.000
it was like four a.m. his time.

26:18.000 --> 26:19.000
And he went,

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
David.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
I was like,

26:21.000 --> 26:22.000
yeah.

26:22.000 --> 26:23.000
And he goes,

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
it's the motherland.

26:25.000 --> 26:28.000
And I was like,

26:28.000 --> 26:29.000
what's happening?

26:29.000 --> 26:30.000
He's like,

26:30.000 --> 26:31.000
it's the motherland.

26:31.000 --> 26:32.000
It's so beautiful.

26:32.000 --> 26:33.000
I'm like,

26:33.000 --> 26:34.000
what happened?

26:34.000 --> 26:35.000
And he's like,

26:35.000 --> 26:36.000
I went to this store

26:36.000 --> 26:37.000
and this,

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
this woman told me that I reminded her

26:39.000 --> 26:40.000
of her son

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
who was fighting in the Golan Heights.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.000
And I was like,

26:43.000 --> 26:44.000
oh no, you got swindled.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.000
How much money did you spend?

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
And she's like,

26:46.000 --> 26:47.000
she gave me this pendant

26:47.000 --> 26:48.000
and she said it was his

26:48.000 --> 26:49.000
and I was,

26:49.000 --> 26:50.000
she said I wanted,

26:50.000 --> 26:51.000
I want you to have this.

26:51.000 --> 26:52.000
And I was like,

26:52.000 --> 26:53.000
how much,

26:53.000 --> 26:54.000
how much?

26:54.000 --> 26:55.000
And he's like,

26:55.000 --> 26:56.000
it was $350.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
And I was like,

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
no.

26:58.000 --> 26:59.000
Cause you know that the second

26:59.000 --> 27:00.000
he left the store,

27:00.000 --> 27:01.000
she just took another pendant

27:01.000 --> 27:02.000
and put it on the thing.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
And she would remind me of my son.

27:04.000 --> 27:05.000
Well the truth is a lot of people

27:05.000 --> 27:06.000
there look like her son.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.000
Yeah, that's true.

27:07.000 --> 27:08.000
You mean it's a...

27:08.000 --> 27:09.000
Yeah.

27:09.000 --> 27:10.000
Yeah.

27:10.000 --> 27:14.000
And she just has a box

27:14.000 --> 27:15.000
of her son's stuff.

27:15.000 --> 27:16.000
She's not really swindling people.

27:16.000 --> 27:17.000
She's just like,

27:17.000 --> 27:18.000
fuck.

27:18.000 --> 27:19.000
If you see another guy,

27:19.000 --> 27:20.000
I'd never mind him.

27:20.000 --> 27:23.000
But she's always charging $350.

27:23.000 --> 27:26.000
This is my son's corn t-shirt.

27:26.000 --> 27:31.000
He would have wanted you to have it.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
He would have wanted you to pay me $350

27:33.000 --> 27:36.000
to get 17 boxes of corn t-shirts

27:36.000 --> 27:39.000
printed on cafe press.

27:39.000 --> 27:40.000
Yeah.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
I think it's delightful.

27:42.000 --> 27:48.000
I think Wasps suffer from lack of mythology,

27:48.000 --> 27:49.000
lack of rites of passage.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
We have confirmation maybe,

27:51.000 --> 27:52.000
kind of.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.000
A lot of kids out here

27:53.000 --> 27:54.000
probably had confirmation,

27:54.000 --> 27:57.000
maybe if they were Catholic enough.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
But there's really...

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
Some people got drunk

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
and had to go hunt with their dads

28:03.000 --> 28:04.000
and kill a deer, maybe.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
I think that's probably the thing of the past.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
Most of us got in a fight

28:08.000 --> 28:09.000
with someone on prom night.

28:09.000 --> 28:12.000
But there's not enough of the...

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
Not enough of the...

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
As if Bar Mitzvah these days are so pure.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
The Bar Mitzvah ritualistic.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.000
Well, that's another topic, though.

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
It's like this secularization

28:21.000 --> 28:25.000
of the theology and Judaism

28:25.000 --> 28:28.000
hasn't made it less functional.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
That's what I like.

28:30.000 --> 28:33.000
As a Jewophile, whatever the word is,

28:33.000 --> 28:36.000
I'm always jealous of the fact that it's like,

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
yeah, they figured it out.

28:38.000 --> 28:41.000
They got a religion where they believe in an entity

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
that they can have one foot in, one foot out.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
They can get their shit done.

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
The focus is on community and family.

28:47.000 --> 28:50.000
It's not based on this McDonald's like,

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
hey, fucking, whose city wants one?

28:52.000 --> 28:53.000
You can have one.

28:53.000 --> 28:54.000
Here's your Big Mac maker.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.000
What?

28:55.000 --> 28:56.000
The health department closed you down?

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
We don't know you.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
There's no Vatican and Judaism.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
There's no like, it's not like Subway.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
It's not like this is like...

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
Subway is also a great company.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
That being able to shoot outdoors in season six

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
may be totally reliant on,

29:16.000 --> 29:19.000
so I didn't mean to connect those dots.

29:20.000 --> 29:23.000
Subway actually, I think Subway would probably say...

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
They wouldn't say this, but...

29:25.000 --> 29:28.000
Off record, they might say,

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
no, we function more like Judaism than Christianity

29:30.000 --> 29:33.000
because I think the reason why Subway is able to be so game

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
is that they actually are...

29:35.000 --> 29:38.000
They're like a disbanded group of franchises.

29:38.000 --> 29:42.000
There isn't like a central capital where it's like,

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
I'm Mr. Subway and I'm angry.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
I want to take over the world.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
Who's not helping me?

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
Subway is more Jewish than Christian.

29:52.000 --> 29:57.000
If there's 12 Subway employees in one place,

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
that's a minion.

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
You can make new rules for Subway.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
I think that's really cool.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
And you know, if you bring a baby into Subway,

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
they will cut his little wiener

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
and suck the blood with their mouths.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
They might. They might.

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
Is community like the cool Christian church

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
that plays guitar?

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
Subway's cool.

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
Yeah, we get it.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
The pastor that only sits backwards in his chair,

30:26.000 --> 30:29.000
like, guys, let me rap to you about a friend of mine named JC.

30:32.000 --> 30:35.000
Yeah, like, well, I guess that's the thing

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
Judaism and Christianity have in common.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
They always bury the lead.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
No one can be genuinely proud

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
like those Christian shows for kids that are like,

30:44.000 --> 30:47.000
like, listen, this show is called How to Rock.

30:47.000 --> 30:51.000
For Jesus.

30:51.000 --> 30:54.000
How to get your parents to do whatever you want.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
Well, I'm going to tell you,

30:56.000 --> 30:59.000
I know the guy who wrote the book on being radical.

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
It's Jesus.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
Like, they draw you in.

31:04.000 --> 31:08.000
That's like 20 minutes into a 40-minute Kirk Cameron tape

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
you're watching.

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
It's just called Super Dude.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
And it's just like 20 minutes in.

31:14.000 --> 31:17.000
And then at least he asks 113 and says, oh, man.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
Yeah, these girls came up to me at a mall

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
when I was like 16 and I'm like, hey,

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
you want to go to a party?

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
And I'm like, do I?

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
Turns out it was church.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
That was the big thing in my neighborhood,

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
Brown Deer, Wisconsin.

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
It was the lock-ins.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
We're having a lock-in.

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
Like the cutest girls in high school.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
There's going to be a lock-in.

31:40.000 --> 31:43.000
They didn't know that they were advertising this thing.

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
It was just a natural, organic thing that was happening.

31:45.000 --> 31:48.000
It was like some studly dude with a guitar and long hair

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
who then, like, all the girls have crushes on him.

31:50.000 --> 31:53.000
He sends them out like, why don't you guys go tell all your friends?

31:53.000 --> 31:56.000
Like, let's fucking, let's just hang out tomorrow.

31:56.000 --> 32:00.000
We've got to lock the doors, you know, just because.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
Not because anyone's going to want to leave

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
once I reveal why we're actually there.

32:07.000 --> 32:11.000
It's just so that non-rocking people can't get in

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
after midnight.

32:13.000 --> 32:14.000
This is high school?

32:14.000 --> 32:15.000
Yeah.

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
Just like kids who went to school with their kids in the town?

32:17.000 --> 32:18.000
Yeah.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
It's a small Midwestern town, so there was a, you know,

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
there was a lot of people that loved them some Jesus.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
It's such a culty vibe.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
It was always, I mean, there was just church youth groups

32:26.000 --> 32:27.000
there everywhere.

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
I mean, that's like, like, there's, I'm sure by applause,

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
how many people went through a,

32:31.000 --> 32:34.000
through a small Christian phase in their teenage years.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
Like, you don't know, see?

32:36.000 --> 32:37.000
Whoa.

32:37.000 --> 32:38.000
It's our shul.

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
It's our, it's our Israel.

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
Is anyone going through a Christian phase now?

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
It's cool to do when you're an adult.

32:49.000 --> 32:50.000
Wait, I want to try one.

32:50.000 --> 32:53.000
Has anyone been to a bar mitzvah where they had blow-up

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
inflatable saxophones?

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
Yeah!

32:58.000 --> 33:01.000
Inflatable saxophones is my religion.

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
How many Jews are in the audience?

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
Is your mother Jewish?

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
Oh!

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
More people clap that time than the,

33:12.000 --> 33:13.000
Who's Jewish?

33:13.000 --> 33:14.000
Yeah.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
See, you explained to me the reason for the mother rule

33:16.000 --> 33:20.000
is of course because there, before paternity tests,

33:20.000 --> 33:24.000
before modern society, if you had to know,

33:24.000 --> 33:27.000
the only way you could know for sure who,

33:27.000 --> 33:30.000
where you came from was the mother side.

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
That was like rate-proofing it, right?

33:32.000 --> 33:33.000
That's what somebody told me.

33:33.000 --> 33:34.000
Yeah.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
Because there's a lot of Roman soldiers.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
If you go by paternal lineage,

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
you can start to fudge the books,

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
but it's hard to fake a birth.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
So, Jewishness goes by the mother's side.

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
If you're half Jewish on your mom's side,

33:48.000 --> 33:49.000
you're allowed to just go,

33:49.000 --> 33:50.000
I'm totes Jewish.

33:50.000 --> 33:51.000
Yeah.

33:51.000 --> 33:54.000
Sorry about my dad getting in there,

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
but it won't happen again.

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
I will carry this torch.

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
I will go on J-Day and I will...

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
The Jewish mother versus Jewish father

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
creates a real school-day schism

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
amongst the half Jews, yeah.

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
Yeah, she knows what I'm talking about.

34:10.000 --> 34:11.000
That's true.

34:11.000 --> 34:12.000
Wait, what do you mean?

34:12.000 --> 34:13.000
Spike Lee's school days.

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
No, we know that.

34:15.000 --> 34:16.000
Let me explain something.

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
It's a movie that's Spike Lee.

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
What's the controversy?

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
She knows what I'm talking about.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
Well, why do you put it off on her?

34:24.000 --> 34:25.000
Yeah, you're right.

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
I guess I know one of the mic.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
The half Jews whose mother are Jewish

34:31.000 --> 34:34.000
kind of has like, well, I'm the real Jew.

34:34.000 --> 34:35.000
You're not.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
You're just a half Jew, biologically.

34:37.000 --> 34:38.000
I'm not saying it's good.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
You're saying there are Jews

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
who are born on their mom's side, half Jews.

34:42.000 --> 34:43.000
Yeah.

34:43.000 --> 34:44.000
Oh, so it's like...

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
Look down their nose at the ones whose dad is Jewish.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
Look down their prodigious noses.

34:50.000 --> 34:51.000
Listen, don't take this lightly.

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
I'm going to look down my nose.

34:53.000 --> 34:56.000
It's taking me a long time to look down this nose,

34:56.000 --> 34:59.000
so know that I mean it when I say it.

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
Motherfucker.

35:05.000 --> 35:06.000
Yeah, man.

35:06.000 --> 35:09.000
Dave Horowitz was looking down his nose at me the other day.

35:09.000 --> 35:10.000
It took forever.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
It was exhausting.

35:12.000 --> 35:15.000
He had to take a break halfway through

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
with a glass of water.

35:20.000 --> 35:21.000
That nose thing.

35:21.000 --> 35:25.000
I guess I've seen the nose thing.

35:25.000 --> 35:26.000
Yeah, you're looking at it.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
You don't have a big nose.

35:28.000 --> 35:29.000
No, you don't.

35:29.000 --> 35:30.000
Not at all.

35:30.000 --> 35:31.000
Not even close.

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
You have Eugene Levy eyebrows.

35:33.000 --> 35:34.000
You don't have...

35:34.000 --> 35:37.000
But like we agreed, the cooler version.

35:37.000 --> 35:38.000
The cooler version.

35:38.000 --> 35:39.000
Oh, yeah.

35:39.000 --> 35:40.000
No, the hips.

35:40.000 --> 35:41.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
But that's crazy.

35:43.000 --> 35:47.000
You have body dysmorphia if you think your nose is unusual.

35:47.000 --> 35:50.000
I'm just saying that Eugene Levy I am would want you to call him Gene.

35:52.000 --> 35:53.000
That's all.

35:53.000 --> 35:54.000
That's all.

35:54.000 --> 35:59.000
Maybe it's my, I have like, you know, kind of face blindness, self-diagnosed aloofness.

35:59.000 --> 36:02.000
So maybe I just don't see noses.

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
How can you miss it?

36:05.000 --> 36:13.000
I embarrassingly was unaware of what a minority I was in as a Jew,

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
because like the tenant grew up in a small and it was,

36:15.000 --> 36:20.000
at this point, like 74% Jewish, more temples and churches.

36:20.000 --> 36:27.000
And I got to school and like college and nobody, like everyone I talked to was like,

36:27.000 --> 36:30.000
you're like, and they would, they thought for a half a second,

36:30.000 --> 36:33.000
like you're like the third Jewish person.

36:33.000 --> 36:34.000
No, no, no, hold on.

36:34.000 --> 36:35.000
That guy, what's the second?

36:35.000 --> 36:36.000
I think you're the second Jewish person I've ever talked to.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
And I couldn't believe it.

36:38.000 --> 36:41.000
And, and I experienced such like mild antisemitism,

36:41.000 --> 36:45.000
because it would just be like a kid on my floor who was super drunk would be like,

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
so you're Jewish?

36:47.000 --> 36:52.000
I'm like, uh-huh. So like you don't, like Christmas is like not.

36:52.000 --> 36:57.000
Like it's like, do you don't do, I'm like, no, we don't, I don't,

36:57.000 --> 36:58.000
my family doesn't do it.

36:58.000 --> 37:01.000
And he's like, oh, that fucking sucks.

37:01.000 --> 37:04.000
Yeah, they're just like, well, because they grew up in the same,

37:04.000 --> 37:07.000
same scenario you did except the other way around.

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
I was like, I don't know,

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
I guess there might have been some Jewish kids around.

37:11.000 --> 37:12.000
I was just like, it wasn't introduced.

37:12.000 --> 37:16.000
I wasn't indoctrinated into it until like it slowly trickles into your awareness.

37:16.000 --> 37:19.000
Cause you're just talking about a bunch of white people.

37:19.000 --> 37:23.000
Like it's, it's a lot easier to get indoctrinated into racism on the,

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
on the grade school playground.

37:25.000 --> 37:29.000
And then, and then, and then it's more of a like high school college thing.

37:29.000 --> 37:32.000
Like you slowly hear this weird word that doesn't mean anything.

37:32.000 --> 37:35.000
And then you, and then you go to college and you meet someone that,

37:35.000 --> 37:36.000
and you go like, okay.

37:36.000 --> 37:37.000
So what's that?

37:37.000 --> 37:40.000
And you ask him a bunch of weird questions the way that you might ask a black person,

37:40.000 --> 37:41.000
weird questions.

37:41.000 --> 37:44.000
If you hadn't been, if you didn't grow up around them,

37:44.000 --> 37:47.000
you would, which would be mildly racist because of your strange,

37:47.000 --> 37:52.000
misdirected like seeking of truth and the well-rounded.

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
But then, and then also you just observe like,

37:54.000 --> 37:59.000
Oh, not everyone's last name ends in like wits or Stein or like a gold or Berg.

37:59.000 --> 38:00.000
There's a lot of shit to get straight.

38:00.000 --> 38:03.000
I mean, a lot more Smiths outside of Sharon, Massachusetts.

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
A lot more.

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
Ah, Jews.

38:07.000 --> 38:08.000
All right.

38:08.000 --> 38:09.000
Hey, Dan.

38:09.000 --> 38:10.000
Yeah.

38:10.000 --> 38:11.000
Can I have some more vodka?

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
Yeah.

38:13.000 --> 38:18.000
I mean, I don't usually serve it, but you're doing great.

38:18.000 --> 38:19.000
Way to go, Ryan.

38:19.000 --> 38:20.000
Ryan Ridley.

38:20.000 --> 38:28.000
Hey, Auntie.

38:28.000 --> 38:35.000
This one's for, this one's for Auntie's birthday.

38:35.000 --> 38:40.000
Auntie's been moonlighting at other podcasts.

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
But we're always happy to see them.

38:42.000 --> 38:43.000
All right.

38:43.000 --> 38:44.000
So.

38:44.000 --> 38:45.000
What's up?

38:45.000 --> 38:46.000
What's up?

38:46.000 --> 38:47.000
What else you got?

38:47.000 --> 38:51.000
I want to bring out, I want to bring out my, uh, uh, my rabbi friend, Spencer Crittenden

38:51.000 --> 38:52.000
Day.

38:52.000 --> 38:53.000
Yeah.

38:53.000 --> 38:54.000
Yeah.

38:54.000 --> 38:55.000
All right.

38:55.000 --> 38:56.000
I know.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.000
I could write my first high five.

38:57.000 --> 38:58.000
That was a really good high five.

38:58.000 --> 38:59.000
The weirdest.

38:59.000 --> 39:00.000
I didn't get a high five.

39:00.000 --> 39:11.000
I was about to say, you know, who didn't get a high five.

39:11.000 --> 39:12.000
Ryan Ridley.

39:12.000 --> 39:13.000
All right.

39:13.000 --> 39:17.000
A lot of backstory to Spencer and I's relationship.

39:17.000 --> 39:21.000
It's a very complex and storied history.

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
It'll come through.

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
It'll, it'll, it'll shine.

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
It always shines through.

39:27.000 --> 39:28.000
It always shines through.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
Do you have something you want to say, Spencer?

39:30.000 --> 39:34.000
I have so many things that I want to say right now.

39:34.000 --> 39:35.000
All right.

39:35.000 --> 39:36.000
Say, say one of them.

39:36.000 --> 39:37.000
Okay.

39:37.000 --> 39:42.000
What was all this you were saying about helium Dan, because I had some issues.

39:42.000 --> 39:43.000
It's, it's lighter than air.

39:43.000 --> 39:44.000
It sure is.

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
And then, so the tank is lighter.

39:46.000 --> 39:52.000
It is lighter than if you had a tank equally sized of us, say, you know, like, uh, air.

39:52.000 --> 39:53.000
Nothing.

39:53.000 --> 39:54.000
Propane.

39:54.000 --> 39:55.000
Yeah.

39:55.000 --> 39:56.000
Or air.

39:56.000 --> 39:59.000
It's still not, you know, it's not, it's not lighter than air on its own.

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
It's just, it's, it's pressurized.

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
So it's, it's denser than air.

40:03.000 --> 40:06.000
But even pressurized, it's lighter than pressurized air.

40:06.000 --> 40:09.000
It's lighter than, uh, equally pressurized area.

40:09.000 --> 40:15.000
So, so, so, so looking at a tank of helium that looked like a similar tank of propane,

40:15.000 --> 40:21.000
I was like, the reason why I was amazed as I lifted it up is because of what was inside it.

40:21.000 --> 40:22.000
Helium.

40:22.000 --> 40:23.000
Yeah.

40:23.000 --> 40:24.000
All right.

40:24.000 --> 40:27.000
Well, I guess I don't have any issues then.

40:27.000 --> 40:30.000
It just sounds like you're saying, oh, it's floating away.

40:30.000 --> 40:31.000
It's this helium.

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
No, no, I mean, I don't, it's possible.

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
They got to get that shit in blimps.

40:35.000 --> 40:41.000
It's possible that the same way they dye cheddar cheese orange, like, because otherwise you wouldn't think it was cheese.

40:41.000 --> 40:45.000
Um, they, they might make helium tanks lighter material.

40:45.000 --> 40:48.000
So that you're like, like, so that people are shopping for helium.

40:48.000 --> 40:51.000
They're like, oh, fuck this brand of helium.

40:51.000 --> 40:55.000
That tank's fucking like, like, like, like, you can barely lift it, Martha.

40:55.000 --> 40:56.000
Oh, look at this.

40:56.000 --> 40:57.000
This is the light stuff.

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
This is a good one.

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
That's a good tank.

41:01.000 --> 41:06.000
Now, what's weird about the cheese thing you were talking about is they get you on both sides with the cheese.

41:06.000 --> 41:07.000
They dye it orange.

41:07.000 --> 41:08.000
They're like, oh, this is cheese.

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
This is what cheese looks like orange.

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
And then they come back with you on the backside.

41:12.000 --> 41:15.000
How about this fine aged white cheddar?

41:15.000 --> 41:16.000
Yeah.

41:16.000 --> 41:19.000
It's just the same cheese without fucking dye in it.

41:19.000 --> 41:20.000
And they say it's better.

41:20.000 --> 41:21.000
Yeah.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
But then they say it's good cheese because it has dye in it.

41:23.000 --> 41:26.000
I'm upset about cheese.

41:26.000 --> 41:29.000
I think you should be.

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
It's not better things.

41:31.000 --> 41:35.000
It's the best thing I've been upset about in a while, I gotta say.

41:35.000 --> 41:39.000
Spencer, I think that, and I only say this because I'm a cheddar enthusiast,

41:39.000 --> 41:43.000
and I'm not trying to step on anything you're saying, but thank you.

41:43.000 --> 41:47.000
I think that maybe when it's extra sharp or sharp, it tends to be white,

41:47.000 --> 41:51.000
and then regular levels of sharpness, that's the orange.

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
So maybe that's how they're distinguishing it.

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
You know, outside of Tillamook, I don't know what to say,

41:55.000 --> 42:00.000
but a lot of cheeses are very sharp as well as orange.

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
So I mean, I don't know.

42:02.000 --> 42:05.000
This is a great argument to have, I think.

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
I don't know if it counts as an argument.

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
I'm arguing. I think it does.

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
Now it definitely is.

42:11.000 --> 42:14.000
Well, I agree with you, so now it's not an argument.

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
Well, I disagree.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
You disagree with me agreeing with you.

42:18.000 --> 42:19.000
Agreeing with you, yeah.

42:19.000 --> 42:20.000
Hey, Spencer.

42:20.000 --> 42:21.000
Hey, Ryan Ridley.

42:21.000 --> 42:24.000
What's your favorite level of sharpness?

42:24.000 --> 42:25.000
Um...

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
I'd say, you know...

42:27.000 --> 42:28.000
Wait, wait, wait.

42:28.000 --> 42:33.000
I just wanted the record to show that Ryan gave me a very sly look when he asked that question.

42:33.000 --> 42:34.000
Watch this.

42:34.000 --> 42:37.000
I think I finally figured this controlling out.

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
Like, the trap has been set.

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
I'm about to let her rip.

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
Extra sharp, I guess.

42:45.000 --> 42:46.000
That's the right answer.

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
All right.

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
I could have made that up.

42:50.000 --> 42:53.000
Ask me what my favorite type of denim is.

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
What's your favorite type of denim?

42:55.000 --> 42:58.000
Uh, high-grade, best denim.

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
He's right. That's a good grade.

43:00.000 --> 43:03.000
If the sharp might be too sharp for some people, anybody? Anybody?

43:03.000 --> 43:06.000
Well, why didn't you tell him he was right when he said extra sharp?

43:06.000 --> 43:09.000
Because I hear how two people clapped.

43:09.000 --> 43:12.000
Because I am right.

43:12.000 --> 43:13.000
All right.

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
We've got to give Ryan his opinions.

43:15.000 --> 43:16.000
All right.

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
If you've just tuned in...

43:18.000 --> 43:27.000
If you decide, if you ask yourself, what's going on in a minute, 54 of a podcast?

43:27.000 --> 43:30.000
This may become a spin-off podcast.

43:30.000 --> 43:33.000
Jeez, craftsmen.

43:33.000 --> 43:40.000
We went to Holland once, me and Aaron and Rob Straub and his wife.

43:40.000 --> 43:46.000
And we somehow, like, we had asked the travel agent, like, or she was like,

43:46.000 --> 43:50.000
you want me to help you? Have a good time?

43:50.000 --> 43:54.000
Not like that. That sounds weird.

43:54.000 --> 43:58.000
And we're like, yeah, I guess it's just like, you know, you should take a tour of the windmills

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
and where they make the cheese and stuff.

44:00.000 --> 44:03.000
And it was like, we were like, okay, at some point, someone agreed to this.

44:03.000 --> 44:09.000
So, I think someone just asked the hotel owner, like, could they...

44:09.000 --> 44:13.000
Is there someone that would want to take them out and look at the windmills and the cheese?

44:13.000 --> 44:16.000
And then that guy must have been like, okay, sure.

44:16.000 --> 44:19.000
And then got off the phone and was like, what the fuck are they talking about?

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
And called another guy.

44:21.000 --> 44:25.000
So, long story short, like, one morning we all have to get on our winter clothes

44:25.000 --> 44:30.000
and go out in the front of the hotel where this guy, he's a cab driver.

44:30.000 --> 44:33.000
And he's just the guy that the hotel owner knows.

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
Can you drive them to the windmills?

44:35.000 --> 44:36.000
He's a fixer.

44:36.000 --> 44:40.000
And then also, yeah, like, here's some extra money.

44:40.000 --> 44:43.000
Tell them about the windmills and the cheese.

44:43.000 --> 44:47.000
And so this guy was just walking around, chain smoking, talking about the windmills.

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
But he was just a guy.

44:49.000 --> 44:53.000
And we went into this cheese factory and that's when it got really weird.

44:53.000 --> 44:57.000
Because he walked in and he was like trying to earn this money he made,

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
but he was just a cab driver.

44:59.000 --> 45:02.000
But he was in this cheese museum and factory.

45:02.000 --> 45:09.000
So he was like walking up onto the exhibit and fucking with cheese.

45:09.000 --> 45:12.000
Like, touching the exhibit cheese.

45:12.000 --> 45:16.000
And then people would come over and yell at him and dutch.

45:16.000 --> 45:20.000
And then he'd say something and dutch back and be pointing at us.

45:20.000 --> 45:24.000
And I was clearly saying, like, look, I have these four American people.

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
Like, I'm being paid a lot of money.

45:26.000 --> 45:29.000
I'll give you 20% if you let me keep rolling with this.

45:29.000 --> 45:33.000
And they would kind of walk away confused, go back behind the gift counter.

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
And he's like, shurning shit.

45:35.000 --> 45:39.000
Like, don't touch this. He's behind the velvet rope going.

45:39.000 --> 45:42.000
And then there's other tourists gathering and going like,

45:42.000 --> 45:45.000
oh, this guy's talking about how to make cheese.

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
He doesn't work there.

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
He had lost his mind.

45:49.000 --> 45:52.000
He was a rogue cheese exhibitor.

45:52.000 --> 45:55.000
And then he's like, and then we do this and then we do that.

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
And he's like, he kept using the word we.

45:57.000 --> 46:00.000
And I'm looking around at everyone in their dirndles and their wood shoes

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
and their napkin hats or whatever.

46:02.000 --> 46:05.000
And they're like rolling their eyes.

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
The cab driver has taken over the museum.

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
He's lost his mind.

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
We don't have police here.

46:11.000 --> 46:12.000
We just have a bunch of cameras.

46:12.000 --> 46:13.000
Weed is legal.

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
So what is this?

46:15.000 --> 46:18.000
And the guy is showing us how they make cheese.

46:18.000 --> 46:19.000
He grates some.

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
He peels off a slice.

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
And then he goes, and we do this, and we do this, and we do this.

46:23.000 --> 46:24.000
And then we eat it.

46:24.000 --> 46:25.000
And it's good.

46:25.000 --> 46:26.000
And he just eats it.

46:26.000 --> 46:29.000
He eats the museum cheese.

46:29.000 --> 46:30.000
He ate it.

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
And he was talking with his mouth full.

46:32.000 --> 46:36.000
He's eating cheese from the, it was museum cheese.

46:36.000 --> 46:37.000
Well, that's gross.

46:37.000 --> 46:38.000
He ate it.

46:38.000 --> 46:44.000
It could have been like the cheese that George Washington brought to Hollis.

46:44.000 --> 46:47.000
He didn't know anyone there or what was going on.

46:47.000 --> 46:48.000
He just.

46:48.000 --> 46:54.000
He's not, he's not handling it with, he doesn't have, this is a dumb question.

46:54.000 --> 46:55.000
No gloves, right?

46:55.000 --> 46:56.000
No!

46:56.000 --> 46:57.000
Wow!

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
Cigarette, nicotine, fingers.

46:59.000 --> 47:04.000
Cheese, he's in the fucking, there's mannequins next to him.

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
That's the environment he's in.

47:06.000 --> 47:15.000
He's on a stage behind a rope designed to keep normal people like cab drivers from going

47:15.000 --> 47:23.000
up and using what is essentially a fake kitchen to go, oh, let's make some cheese.

47:23.000 --> 47:26.000
No, we put a rope so you don't.

47:26.000 --> 47:30.000
It's a mannequin pretending to make cheese in 1820.

47:30.000 --> 47:33.000
That's what this is for, is for looking.

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
And he's pumping into shit.

47:35.000 --> 47:38.000
He's fucking, he's got one of those caps on.

47:38.000 --> 47:42.000
He's just, he's just, it looks like Benny Hill.

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
Did he seem like he knew what he was talking about?

47:44.000 --> 47:45.000
No!

47:45.000 --> 47:46.000
No!

47:46.000 --> 47:47.000
No!

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
I should have known.

47:49.000 --> 47:52.000
Like he knows that cheese is old milk.

47:52.000 --> 47:53.000
That's it.

47:53.000 --> 47:57.000
He knew everything I know about cheese and he had an accent.

47:57.000 --> 48:00.000
And he just, and then he was just eating shit.

48:00.000 --> 48:06.000
And then we were walking around, we just felt like the worst like American shitty third

48:06.000 --> 48:10.000
act of fucking Wally people, you know.

48:10.000 --> 48:15.000
Like we just felt like we were these big fat boneless Americans that had like co-opted

48:15.000 --> 48:20.000
some guy and he was like explaining them money, money, money, money, cheese, cheese, cheese.

48:20.000 --> 48:23.000
Now my son gets his teeth fixed.

48:23.000 --> 48:26.000
Yes, yes.

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
Hegemony.

48:28.000 --> 48:33.000
I mean, that sounds like a better tour than you'd ever get from an official Cheese Museum

48:33.000 --> 48:34.000
tour.

48:34.000 --> 48:35.000
Well, I feel like you lucked out.

48:35.000 --> 48:40.000
I wouldn't have gone to a Cheese Museum, but I often, every once in a while, can look

48:40.000 --> 48:43.000
over at my fiance and go, do you remember the Cheese Museum?

48:43.000 --> 48:44.000
Yes, I do.

48:44.000 --> 48:45.000
And that's kind of fun.

48:45.000 --> 48:46.000
That's good.

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
That's what traveling is really about.

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
In the moment, it felt very awkward.

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
Did he offer you any of the cheese?

48:52.000 --> 48:53.000
No.

48:53.000 --> 48:54.000
No.

48:54.000 --> 48:55.000
That's the weirdest part.

48:55.000 --> 48:56.000
That is the weirdest part.

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
He ate it in front of everyone.

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
People were taking pictures of him.

49:00.000 --> 49:05.000
They thought he was like some kind of performer, like an improviser.

49:05.000 --> 49:09.000
Like a cheese mascot, like I'm a representative, I don't know anything, but I'm enthusiastic

49:09.000 --> 49:10.000
and that's enough.

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
Or that he was part that he worked there.

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
They thought what they should have thought.

49:14.000 --> 49:19.000
Like because I don't know how long you could do that before someone tases you.

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
But museum staff just gave up.

49:21.000 --> 49:22.000
They're like, we don't want to touch this.

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
They did it because he was just insistent.

49:24.000 --> 49:28.000
They said they did all a human should have to do, which is, please, clearly I don't speak

49:28.000 --> 49:31.000
their language, but they were clearly saying, please, please stop.

49:31.000 --> 49:32.000
Yeah.

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
Please stop running around.

49:34.000 --> 49:39.000
Our private property, like banging into things, knocking over mannequins and stealing cheese.

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
Please stop doing that.

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
They don't give up that easily at the Louvre.

49:43.000 --> 49:44.000
Not much.

49:44.000 --> 49:45.000
All right.

49:45.000 --> 49:48.000
He's fucking with Mona Lisa.

49:48.000 --> 49:49.000
Yeah.

49:49.000 --> 49:50.000
So you should go there.

49:50.000 --> 49:51.000
I mean, I don't know.

49:51.000 --> 49:55.000
It's crazy.

49:55.000 --> 49:56.000
It's weird.

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
Windmills are weird.

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
You know what those things do on the inside?

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
When you see a picture of a windmill, you're like, why do they make those?

50:02.000 --> 50:03.000
There's like big pinwheels.

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
You know, when you're a kid, you're like, why do they?

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
Well, there's still a lot of work to put into.

50:07.000 --> 50:12.000
You know, the things on the inside, most of them, they saw lumber.

50:12.000 --> 50:13.000
You know what they do with it?

50:13.000 --> 50:16.000
They make more windmills.

50:16.000 --> 50:20.000
Windmills are like a virus.

50:20.000 --> 50:25.000
They take over the T-cells, and then they just like, if we hadn't stopped these people

50:25.000 --> 50:30.000
in their tracks, our world would be covered with windmills for no reason.

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
They wouldn't be generating electricity.

50:32.000 --> 50:35.000
They would just be generating more windmills.

50:35.000 --> 50:39.000
If we would make first contact on the flanks after we'd bump off of the earth because

50:39.000 --> 50:42.000
there would be these fucking blades spinning everywhere.

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
You know, they would have eventually started making a lot of plastic,

50:44.000 --> 50:48.000
and they would have been toxic.

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
It's very interesting, though.

50:50.000 --> 50:53.000
They make windmills over there.

50:53.000 --> 50:56.000
There's people that make them just like they used to.

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
We're only going to use the equipment they used to use.

50:58.000 --> 51:02.000
It just seems like, so, God, you've got to really be into something.

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
I was like, why that?

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
We're just going to use...

51:06.000 --> 51:10.000
We think Civil War re-enactors are weird. These windmill re-enactors.

51:10.000 --> 51:13.000
We're going to make a windmill. We're not going to use any hammers.

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
We're not going to use anything made of metal.

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
Is there new cutting-edge windmill technology?

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
Yeah, definitely.

51:19.000 --> 51:24.000
Do you mean the things that generate wind power? Electricity?

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
They don't just saw wood anymore.

51:26.000 --> 51:27.000
What do they do now?

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
They generate electricity.

51:29.000 --> 51:32.000
Can you call those windmills, though?

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
I call them windmills.

51:34.000 --> 51:38.000
I get, like, being into some OG windmill shit.

51:38.000 --> 51:43.000
It's like, you know, guitar dad who will only use two-bamps, you know?

51:43.000 --> 51:47.000
Who have a man cave full of old two-bamps, and they've got to get them replaced.

51:47.000 --> 51:51.000
One guitar shop in Calabasas, and they know the guy behind the counter.

51:51.000 --> 51:55.000
I'm sure that's how vintage windmill heads are.

51:55.000 --> 52:00.000
When I was programming, I used the VI editor,

52:00.000 --> 52:05.000
and I didn't want to use my mouse. I used the keys.

52:05.000 --> 52:09.000
It's a 35-year-old editor.

52:09.000 --> 52:15.000
I want to design my own webpage, editing with text on an SSH connection or whatever.

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
I guess I was into the purity of that.

52:17.000 --> 52:22.000
Yeah, well, I mean, when I went to film school, they make you edit film on a steamback,

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
like an old-school spinning plates.

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
Yeah, because you're little white gloves, and you're splicing.

52:26.000 --> 52:29.000
Yeah, and you're a little pencil to mark where an edit was.

52:29.000 --> 52:32.000
And they're like, okay, so now you know how that works. Here's final cut.

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
Yeah, exactly.

52:34.000 --> 52:38.000
It was such a colossal waste of time, and my only takeaway from it is, like,

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
that's the hardest thing I've ever done.

52:40.000 --> 52:43.000
Yeah, you're like, that's why this mouse clicker is shaped like that.

52:43.000 --> 52:48.000
That's why they use that icon, because it's based on some guy with a white glove.

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
Just, yeah, sitting there.

52:50.000 --> 52:56.000
And the other thing I learned is, like, don't set an entire opened, but full orange juice

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
on one of the spinning plates that the film goes on.

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
Right.

53:00.000 --> 53:03.000
Yeah, that was, like, four hours of my life.

53:03.000 --> 53:07.000
But the film got done. The montage of my friend dancing on the street

53:07.000 --> 53:12.000
set to an RJD2 beat got done, and I got an A.

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
And then I moved to Los Angeles.

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
So, I mean...

53:16.000 --> 53:21.000
Did it get an A? Because in between, you would just flash the words capitalism or something?

53:21.000 --> 53:22.000
Yeah.

53:22.000 --> 53:25.000
There was a lot of deep meaning.

53:25.000 --> 53:29.000
Hey, Dave. Was it a pulp?

53:29.000 --> 53:34.000
Or pulp-free?

53:34.000 --> 53:37.000
Yeah, I found my niche.

53:37.000 --> 53:40.000
You did it! He did it!

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
Come on!

53:42.000 --> 53:46.000
What a great night for Comptroller Ryan Ridley.

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
This guy's great.

53:48.000 --> 53:52.000
He cares about the minutiae of things you ingest.

53:52.000 --> 53:53.000
That's his angle.

53:53.000 --> 53:54.000
Ridley stores.

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
You know, Jeff wears suits.

53:56.000 --> 53:59.000
You ask questions about eating.

53:59.000 --> 54:00.000
Round of applause.

54:00.000 --> 54:07.000
Crunchy peanut butter.

54:07.000 --> 54:11.000
I heard somebody booing.

54:11.000 --> 54:14.000
Creamy peanut butter.

54:14.000 --> 54:15.000
Wow.

54:15.000 --> 54:16.000
Even.

54:16.000 --> 54:17.000
That's a 50-50 split.

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
But the creamy people were yelling and going,

54:19.000 --> 54:24.000
Well, the creamies seem forced, like they're like, we really gotta stand up for creamy.

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
Well, how many people are ambi peanut butter?

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
How many people can do crunchy or creamy?

54:28.000 --> 54:31.000
Oh, really? Not that many.

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
Why would you even bother with creamy?

54:33.000 --> 54:34.000
It's what I want to know.

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
I guess sometimes it's good.

54:36.000 --> 54:37.000
I don't know. I like both.

54:37.000 --> 54:42.000
I wouldn't want either to be outlawed.

54:42.000 --> 54:46.000
This is the gentlest conversation that's ever happened on this stage.

54:46.000 --> 54:51.000
We're going to be 85 years old and we can still have the same conversation.

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
That's what's nice about it.

54:53.000 --> 54:57.000
Oh, those ladies' skirts keep getting shorter.

54:57.000 --> 54:58.000
But peanut butter?

54:58.000 --> 55:01.000
This is like the first 20 minutes of those Kirk Cameron Christian movies.

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
Like, hey man.

55:03.000 --> 55:06.000
Hey, if you want to know how to get the most peanut butter in the world,

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
I'm going to tell you.

55:08.000 --> 55:11.000
It's about the power of positivity.

55:11.000 --> 55:14.000
Jesus Christ.

55:14.000 --> 55:18.000
Pray. I can pray for it.

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
This is what drives me nuts about Christianity.

55:20.000 --> 55:24.000
Not Christianity, the actual mythology,

55:24.000 --> 55:27.000
which I think is, I enjoy.

55:27.000 --> 55:31.000
The story of a guy who got killed on purpose is awesome.

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
That's fucking amazing.

55:33.000 --> 55:38.000
It is truly one of the top three greatest stories I've ever told.

55:38.000 --> 55:43.000
I'm going to go Iron Giant and Monster House for the other two.

55:43.000 --> 55:49.000
You're saying, you have a problem with the people who tell the story and how they tell it.

55:49.000 --> 55:52.000
I have a problem with something that, by proper definitions,

55:52.000 --> 55:57.000
shouldn't even be called Christianity, which is this weird capitalist.

55:57.000 --> 56:01.000
We're wearing suits and we're talking about Jesus and we even tell people,

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
you don't even have to read the Bible.

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
You know what's great about Christianity?

56:05.000 --> 56:06.000
He's knocking at your door.

56:06.000 --> 56:09.000
All you got to do is accept him as your personal Christ and savior,

56:09.000 --> 56:12.000
the blood of the blood flood.

56:12.000 --> 56:15.000
And that's it. And just keep coming back and let's just hang out.

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
Let's just be Christian.

56:17.000 --> 56:24.000
It's like this frantic thing that has absolutely no love for the actual mythology anymore.

56:24.000 --> 56:27.000
So it's clearly totally separated from it,

56:27.000 --> 56:30.000
especially the fact that you don't get me started on it.

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
Literally, nobody clapped.

56:32.000 --> 56:39.000
This is an audience of, I think, this mahogany dense atheist log here.

56:39.000 --> 56:42.000
I don't know how that happened.

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
I guess I'll take that as a compliment.

56:44.000 --> 56:47.000
I'm very smart or something, so I just attract atheists.

56:47.000 --> 56:57.000
So I don't think I would be preaching to the non-quirer by ranting about this,

56:57.000 --> 57:03.000
but I think the thing that makes most people atheists and proud of it and evangelical about it

57:03.000 --> 57:09.000
is that it's a modern American phenomenon that happens to be called Christianity,

57:09.000 --> 57:19.000
which has absolutely nothing to do with the ethos, the pathos, or the porthos.

57:19.000 --> 57:30.000
I demand a religion hit all three musketeers before I accept it.

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
Even the jolly drunk one.

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
Why is that porth musketeer?

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
Who is that guy?

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
He's our road in.

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
Why didn't he get lumped in?

57:40.000 --> 57:43.000
He's like the kid in Treasure Island.

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
He's like, boy, those three musketeers.

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
I've never read it, seen the movies.

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
I just know there's a porth guy.

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
I'm like, why isn't it called the four musketeers?

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
Okay, I get it.

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
I bet at the end, they say, from now on...

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
Here's your sword.

57:57.000 --> 58:02.000
Can you give me one of those swords?

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
Sure, Earthos.

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
He brings it back and he hands it to Earthos.

58:06.000 --> 58:12.000
And Earthos is like, no, no one's yours.

58:12.000 --> 58:18.000
And they're like, all for one and one plus one for all.

58:18.000 --> 58:23.000
And then as the crane shot goes away, you just hear an ADR line from D'Artagnan going,

58:23.000 --> 58:26.000
what about my musket?

58:26.000 --> 58:29.000
Am I crazy or should we have muskets?

58:29.000 --> 58:34.000
Why are we famous for sword fighting?

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
This is insane what we do.

58:36.000 --> 58:40.000
Why are we putting so much energy into swords?

58:40.000 --> 58:46.000
They invented the gun for us.

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
Let's shoot some of them.

58:48.000 --> 58:51.000
I feel like D'Artagnan's inclusion is probably conditional.

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
Even if at the end he gets his own sword,

58:53.000 --> 58:56.000
it's just a drive, like turtle for Monterey.

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
You can hang out, turtle.

58:58.000 --> 59:04.000
You can have the fourth hottest girl, but you gotta drive the Escalade.

59:04.000 --> 59:07.000
He has to hang up the flyers and book the rooms.

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
Hey guys, we're having a duel.

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
Here we go, we're having a duel.

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
It's gonna be dope.

59:13.000 --> 59:16.000
When the musketeer's coming to town, he goes into the hotel and they stay in the van.

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
He comes back out with other keys.

59:18.000 --> 59:27.000
I'm gonna be spinning, it's gonna be dope.

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
Well, what do you think, Spencer?

59:29.000 --> 59:33.000
Do you think these guys could play some of this D&D stuff?

59:33.000 --> 59:34.000
I don't know, Dan.

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
I don't think they got what it takes.

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
Hey, what?

59:38.000 --> 59:39.000
Maybe it's a little early.

59:39.000 --> 59:44.000
Should we meet one out-of-town friend before we...

59:44.000 --> 59:49.000
Who is here from a far away?

59:49.000 --> 59:50.000
Scotland, I heard.

59:50.000 --> 59:59.000
Orange County?

59:59.000 --> 01:00:00.000
Australia.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:05.000
We did Australia last week, not that that's how it works.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:09.000
I know there's millions of people there.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
We were out of kangaroo jokes.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:12.000
What did you say?

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Boston.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:14.000
Boston?

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.000
That's nice.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:16.000
I like it in Boston.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
It's like the Milwaukee of the East Coast.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
Who's from the most dangerous place?

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:21.000
Boston.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Australia.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:23.000
Australia, yeah.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:28.000
They're peopled with criminals.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Scotland person, are you willing to come up and share your persona with us?

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:39.000
No?

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Okay.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:41.000
Okay!

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:44.000
That persona's off to a good start.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:47.000
She's very positive.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:51.000
We don't pick on anybody here.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Hello.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.000
Hello.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:57.000
You look like a Scottish movie Scottish person.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:01.000
She's wearing boots and tights and a t-shirt that says Trey Cool on it.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:02.000
Although that's French.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
No, not at all.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
No, I'm applauding your Scottishness.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.000
Thank you.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.000
It's like indie movie Scottish.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:15.000
It's like a movie that's really good, but there's subtitles because they're so Scottish.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
So what's your name?

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.000
Paula.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.000
Paula.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:20.000
What part is Scotland?

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:21.000
Just say Glasgow.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:22.000
Oh, okay.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:23.000
I know where that is.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:27.000
The opposite say it's where he's wearing a...

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
Where we were for Hogman-y?

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Yeah.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.000
Yeah.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Edinburgh.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:33.000
Edinburgh.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:36.000
Edinburgh, which is spelled Edinburgh, but then it's a trap.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:42.000
It seems like a nice Jewish town, Edinburgh.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Just went there to get some relaxation.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:48.000
Everyone's carrying torches.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.000
This is fucking crazy.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
Did you ever do Hogman-y in Edinburgh?

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:56.000
No, I've done it in Glasgow and then it's usually just house parties, but no.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
I don't really like Edinburgh.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
We did the whole torch procession when we were there.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.000
It was crazy.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:04.000
It seems kind of dangerous having that many people in torches.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Yeah, when you do something that dangerous with a group of people...

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:14.000
I guess we've already talked about it on the show, but it was really uplifting because

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:18.000
it really made you feel like, oh, America's wearing this big diaper.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:23.000
We were obsessed with tits and violence and bad words and all these things.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:26.000
America's got a lot of great things about it.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:30.000
Fluoride in the water, most cities.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:31.000
I don't know.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.000
We're great.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:35.000
The Golden Age of Television, mostly our responsibility.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:36.000
You should start something.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:39.000
Get people carrying torches out the streets.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Well, as we've spoken, there's another reason we don't do it here.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:47.000
It has an unfortunate feel to it for us.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
It doesn't represent his passion.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:52.000
It's more of a cowardly, like, oh, I got a flaming stick.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:55.000
Get away, black guy.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:59.000
Stop taking our jerbs.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:03.000
It was like, we did this big parade where I'll carry these torches and it was like,

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
there were kids and everyone was like, there's fucking like...

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:06.000
It's a big thing.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:09.000
You buy the torches at a wall, whatever the equivalent of a Walmart is.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:10.000
Asda.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:14.000
And it's like, they sell them because everyone's going to do this thing.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:18.000
And it's kind of cool because it's like the opposite of disempowering a population.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:22.000
Nobody does anything bad with the torches, but you're being allowed to carry fire,

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:27.000
which is dangerous and everyone's walking and there's embers falling on your hair

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:31.000
and your clothes and there's like a little bit of like, singeing and fire happening.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:32.000
But everyone's fine.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:33.000
Everyone turns out fine.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:37.000
And then you go watch this wicker thing start on fire.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:38.000
Yeah, I could have done it.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
So you're saying it to me.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:41.000
And they're playing...

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:45.000
The only problem is they're playing music the whole way.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:48.000
They have speakers set up the whole, like, many mile, like, march.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:53.000
And they're playing, like, Scottish rock bands and stuff.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:57.000
And after a while, you've heard the same ones, like, five times in a row.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:01.000
There's so many, like, breakouts, Scottish, like, fucking hey.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
They're like, oh, this guy's again, huh?

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
So anyways, Glasgow.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:06.000
All right.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:09.000
I think we were near there.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:12.000
You referenced our trip there.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:15.000
Were you connected to us somehow?

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:18.000
Because I know Jeff put people on the guest list for tonight.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:22.000
You just heard the podcast and heard that we went to Scotland.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
Twice before.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:28.000
Nearly got kicked out twice because I was here with a friend and we were kind of drunk.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.000
Oh, is that you?

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.000
Yeah.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:35.000
Is she here today?

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.000
No.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.000
Okay.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:38.000
Was that the problem?

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
You had to, like, restructure your friendship?

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:41.000
I'm doing okay so far.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:42.000
Yeah, I know.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:43.000
You're great.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
You're very, very gentle and well-mannered.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
You were fine that night, too.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
I mean, who cares?

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Drunk people from Scotland yelling things out.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
It's probably the best thing that happened to a show.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
So what are you on vacation?

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:59.000
I was in Salt Lake City for Comic Con.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
They have a Comic Con in Salt Lake City?

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:02.000
Yeah, it's huge.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:03.000
Wow.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
It's the second year and it was pretty crazy.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.000
Wow.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:07.000
I like that.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:08.000
I was in Salt Lake.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:09.000
They're very nice people.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:13.000
I think it's again, like, we did the tour there and it's like, the Mormon thing is so strong.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:14.000
There may be that that's why.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:19.000
There's, like, the hipster crowd there is very hip because they're, like, breaking away from it.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
It was mainly people from Salt Lake there.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
I don't think there was many out of towners.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Well, I don't know.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:25.000
I didn't speak to many people.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:26.000
Yeah.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:29.000
I mean, we had a packed house and we did a show there and everybody was really thoughtful

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:32.000
and cool and fun and passionate.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:37.000
It's probably a tough city to be anything fringy in, I would imagine.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
Maybe that's a stereotype that's outgrown.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:40.000
I don't know.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:43.000
The Mormons aren't the biggest fringe of them all.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:49.000
Don't turn on your guest comptroller yet.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
He's going to come back.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:54.000
He's going to ask you about bread and butter versus dill pickles at the end.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:55.000
I know it.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:59.000
And you're going to wish that you hadn't.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:00.000
I got you, buddy.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:01.000
I thought they'd like that.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:02.000
I liked it.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:03.000
I don't know.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:08.000
Also, if you're Mormon and you're listening, I have no, absolutely no judgment.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:09.000
I do.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:14.000
I'm going to double down.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:15.000
Smart.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:16.000
That's smart.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:20.000
What the fuck is that shit?

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:27.000
You've had Jews, Christians, and they were on Mormons?

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:32.000
Well, when we were in Salt Lake City, I had a Mormon come up and explain some of the things

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
like, okay, let's talk about this magic underwear.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:35.000
Let's talk about the stuff.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:39.000
Because she was a very sweet, like she was a Harmonton fan, and she was in this town

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:42.000
where she was probably surrounded by people who were like, I don't fucking Mormons.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:43.000
I don't know, though.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:46.000
I don't really know what's going on there, but how people feel about it.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
I'm sure they're all 25 and they don't fucking care anymore.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:52.000
And I'm like 41 and going, oh, Mormonism.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:55.000
But she came up and talked about it.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:59.000
I mean, religion, it says on the bottle, this isn't supposed to make sense.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:04.000
If you buy a religion, and then you open the bottle and you're like, ah, this isn't logical.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
Like, you're an idiot.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:11.000
Like, it's like buying a pair of pants and then trying to drink out of them.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
And you're like, this sucks.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:14.000
I want my money back.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:17.000
It's like, motherfucker, it goes on your legs.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:23.000
Your legs, in this case, being the part of your brain that doesn't understand shit

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:28.000
and is frustrated and wonders what your relationship with an impersonal cosmos is

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
and is afraid you're going to die.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:36.000
And it's going insane because of the truly schizophrenic result of being the world's first

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:43.000
and possibly last sentient mammal, except dolphins, who don't need a religion

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:46.000
because they don't have hands.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:51.000
So they don't have weapons, so they don't have war, so they don't need religion.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:56.000
They just see a shark and they're like, fuck sharks.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Like, dolphins go crazy at sharks.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.000
Did you know that?

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
They fucking hate sharks.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
Isn't that cool?

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
It is cool.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:08.000
It is fucking cool because dolphins are us in the ocean.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
They represent us.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:15.000
You know, they are Ryan and Dave.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:20.000
You might say, dolphins are the Israelis in the Middle East that is the ocean.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Oh, now I'm listening.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
I don't know, hold on.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:28.000
They're like building apartments on all these coral reefs.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:34.000
Now, suddenly, I'm sympathizing for the sharks.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:37.000
I know, and I accidentally just called Muslims sharks.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:40.000
And then thought it was cool.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
That's not what I meant.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
Sorry about that.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:47.000
Do they know that sharks are the bad guys?

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:48.000
That's what it is.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
Well, think about it.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:56.000
Dolphins are mammals that breathe oxygen and they have language and shit.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
Like, they're a new...

01:08:58.000 --> 01:08:59.000
They're like us.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:00.000
What did you say?

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
They're assholes. Dolphins are assholes.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.000
They're assholes.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:06.000
Okay, well, you're coming up in one second, sir.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
I think he already heard us.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:12.000
A guy with an accent I can't place just blurted out they're assholes.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
Dolphins are assholes.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
Well, what about sharks?

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
Yeah, sharks are assholes.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
No opinion on sharks but dolphins are assholes?

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
No, you stay Paula.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:23.000
It's Paula, right?

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:24.000
Yeah.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:25.000
Okay, and you sit there, sir.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:26.000
Andy.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:27.000
Andy.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:28.000
Okay, so explain.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:29.000
Dolphins are assholes.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:30.000
Dolphins are assholes.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:31.000
Well, male dolphins are assholes.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:32.000
Male dolphins.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Yeah, yeah, they separate the women from the pack and then don't let them back into the

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
pod until they've had sex with them.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:39.000
Oh, okay.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:43.000
So when you dig into dolphin like gender hierarchies, okay.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
That's interesting.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:48.000
We're looking at it from very far away.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:51.000
They're so smart and they're like, yeah, we're smart enough to hate bitches.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
Wow, hold on.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:56.000
They don't get to dolphin vote.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:03.000
I think, well.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:11.000
Dude, you were going to say something about...

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:21.000
I was just going to say hashtag yes all dolphins.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:27.000
So Andy, is that a dolphin fact you picked up just as a casual dolphin fanner?

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:28.000
Are you like a...

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:31.000
I want you to say you're an oceanographer.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:36.000
Who like really love dolphins and then they fucking let you down.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:40.000
Like you spent eight years learning to communicate with them to the point where you could hear

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
their opinions about women.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
And you're like, fuck.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:47.000
I learned to squeak for this.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
This guy's rapey.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:55.000
Sure, he could put a ball in the circular hole, but he fucking hates women.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:59.000
It was one of those articles, you know, 20 things about all four things you know about.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
You don't know about animals.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
I mean, don't get started on office.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:04.000
So it was all different animals.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:14.000
Like koala bears believe in separate but equal.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:18.000
They have specially labeled eucalyptus trees.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:21.000
Man, they're just starting all the time.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:24.000
Kittens like euthanasia.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:25.000
Kittens.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
What's all this shit you didn't know about kittens?

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
They're really conservative.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:33.000
They believe that milk should trickle down from their mother's nipples.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:37.000
They hate abortion.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:42.000
All right, well, so, but okay, well, Andy, I mean, is it okay if you just make a cameo

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:45.000
and then we're not quite done with koala?

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:48.000
Anything else to say about dolphins? Do you know anything else about them?

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:49.000
No.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:50.000
Okay.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:56.000
All right, Andy, everybody. Dolphin expert, Andy.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:01.000
I mean, maybe this is, maybe this is just deja vu, but I could swear that earlier on,

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:07.000
on an earlier episode, a guy with a foreign accent said that dolphins were assholes and

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
then came up and defended his remarks.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
Like on a different episode though.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:12.000
On a different guy?

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:13.000
Yeah, I'd assume.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:17.000
I mean, I hope so because he played it off like he'd never done it before this time.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:20.000
It would be amazing if we were living in his edge of tomorrow.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:24.000
I probably am just like, fuck, I could swear.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:28.000
And he's like, no, I've told you this 900 times.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:31.000
Now I have to go get shot.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:35.000
If I could just get you to understand dolphins are assholes by 927.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:38.000
I could then roll under the jeep's tires.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:49.000
At 935, just dolphins burst in from the ceiling.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
So Paula, were you born in Glasgow?

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:52.000
Yes.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
Do you know what the Glasgow grin is?

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:55.000
I should hope so.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:56.000
The Glasgow grin?

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:57.000
Yeah.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:58.000
I guess not.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:03.000
I guess in America we know, maybe it's like a thing, like it's like a Chinese fire drill.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:06.000
It's like actually offensive to people from Glasgow.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
Yeah, it's a Glasgow grin.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:11.000
They call it, some place call it a Chelsea grin.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:12.000
A Chelsea grin?

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:13.000
Yeah.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:14.000
It depends where you live.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:18.000
If you're working in real estate in Glasgow, you call it a Chelsea grin.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:19.000
Yeah.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:20.000
All right.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:23.000
Is it the Sons of Anarchy guy, that thing?

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
Yeah, the Sons of Anarchy guy, yes.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.000
What is it?

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
It's definitely bad, right?

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
It's an ironic name, right?

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:31.000
Physical mutilation.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:34.000
But is it done to you or do you do it yourself?

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
It's physical mutilation.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
You can do it yourself.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
You can do it yourself.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:41.000
Fuck them.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
How about now?

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:44.000
Yeah.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
Yeah, the Sons of Anarchy guy.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
He's from Glasgow, right?

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
Is this like why so serious?

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:53.000
Is this like, do you want to know how I got these scars?

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:54.000
Yes.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:55.000
Okay.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:56.000
Got it.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:59.000
I don't know, it's Sons of Anarchy, but I've seen The Dark Knight.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:03.000
Do you guys think it's cool that I know the name of the guy?

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:08.000
Do you think it's cool that I know the name of the second Batman movie?

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
I can't troll for applause anymore.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
I already wasted it on that one.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:13.000
Sorry.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:18.000
Hey, what kind of peanut butter do you think The Dark Knight prefers?

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:23.000
Crunchy.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:26.000
You guys can't keep eating peanut butter like me.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:30.000
What makes you so special?

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:35.000
I'm not using portable smokers.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:38.000
I couldn't think of it.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:42.000
Everybody said that hockey pants thing, and everyone went, uh, alarmed.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
I'm not wearing hockey pants.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:45.000
Alright.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:53.000
Paula, would you be willing to stay up here and play my fiance's character in Dungeons & Dragons?

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:54.000
You think he can handle that?

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
I mean, there's nothing to handle.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:59.000
It doesn't matter how good you are at it.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
I've never played it, but I'll give it a bash.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:02.000
Have you heard us play it on the podcast ever?

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:03.000
Once.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:04.000
Okay.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:05.000
Yeah.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:08.000
It's like, what happens is, there's guys, I hope those women are all peeing and not doing

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:09.000
a walkout.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:17.000
Like, they're going to go kill some dolphins.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:23.000
I hate their fucking assholes.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
Also, why did I say I hope they're peeing?

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
That's weird to say.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:30.000
What is this, Hustler magazine?

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:31.000
What do you know?

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
Remember when Hustler turned into being about peeing?

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:34.000
Like, women peeing?

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:35.000
No.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
When was that?

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:41.000
Hustler, like, if you open a hustler, like, it's like, there's a lot of, like, it's like,

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:45.000
somebody started complaining at some point when there weren't women peeing.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:48.000
And so there's just like, they make sure that there's always a woman peeing now.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:52.000
Do you think there was like, an executive decision, like a meeting was called to be like,

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:56.000
guys, now, like, starting next month, at least once a month.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:57.000
Yeah.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:02.000
There was obviously like, I don't know, like, I learned about naked women from pages of

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:07.000
Hustler magazine that floated across the railroad tracks into the crawdad creek where we were

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:08.000
hunting crawdad.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:12.000
They sound like Mark Twain.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:18.000
But there was like, like, there was no internet and there was just like, mud caked pages from

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:23.000
this printing plant that apparently printed hustlers across the railroad tracks.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:28.000
And that's where the, you know, other nine year olds and I would go like, that's a booby.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:33.000
And then we would read the stuff like, hey, you can read better.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
Would your pussy like my dick in it?

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:38.000
This is great.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:39.000
What does she say?

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:40.000
What does she say?

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
The next page is missing.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
Laying, laying home awake at night.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:49.000
I hope her pussy likes his dick in it.

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:53.000
And she was a waitress, he was a truck driver and they just started to, it was a pictorial

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:57.000
story, but the text was, what was important.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:01.000
That is so much folksier than how this generation like sees pornography.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:02.000
Yeah.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
I don't know what's, but it's, but it's gross.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:08.000
I mean, it's like, I'm looking at my first female figure and it's like, caked in mud.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:12.000
It's a pretty fundamentally misogynistic, periodic literature.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:19.000
The pages of which are like smeared with mud, a stench of crawdad and algae.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:23.000
It's kind of like, I'm learning either that's like the healthiest thing in the world.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:27.000
Like Yoda's in a tree stump going, yes.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:33.000
The vagina is a terrifying place to go inside.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:39.000
And I go in there and I fight something and then my face is on the clitoris.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:42.000
I come out and I go like, I can't talk about it.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:45.000
I'm going to go to Hollywood.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:49.000
But, but the internet, yeah, it's like, like, like I talked to moms now and they're like,

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
you know, my eight year old kid.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:52.000
What's that?

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:53.000
About the hustlers.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:54.000
Oh, no, no, no.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:58.000
About the, about the new hustler, which is even YouTube, even if you were to have like

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:03.000
some kind of nanny blocker software, which is a joke, like you can't control your kid.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:06.000
Even YouTube is just like, I mean, nobody knows better than me.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:10.000
It is filled with perfectly sexual material.

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:15.000
Like, like, like what do you, like, like the, so like your eight year old kid will just

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
be like, you know, sitting with his eight year old friend.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
What did we do when we were eight year old boys?

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:24.000
We would, we would make these jokes about sex, you know, we would talk about sex with

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:25.000
each other.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:26.000
We were all way off the mark.

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:29.000
We were very curious about it and we were, and we were just fascinated with it.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:33.000
And if you had a laptop back then and you could just type something in and if you could

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:38.000
be the kid that brought the other kids to some piece of information about it, you were a

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:39.000
hero.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:42.000
So there's a capitalistic like competition there.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:43.000
There's no way to control it.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:47.000
I'm really fascinated to talk to moms these days who are.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
Who are these moms you're talking to?

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
Well, like I'm 41.

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
My contemporaries have children.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:58.000
Like they're, you know, funny, funny women who do storytelling shows who have kids that

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:05.000
are like, they catch like watching shit that's fucked up and then hearing them talk about

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:06.000
it is very interesting.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:13.000
If only I could remember that one lady's name that I'm characterizing as all these women.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:19.000
But the dolphin in me says, who cares what her name is?

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:24.000
Let her have the kid and like see if she earns the right to swim, swim, swim.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:25.000
What do they eat shrimp?

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:26.000
I don't know.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:27.000
All right.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:28.000
They hate sharks.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:29.000
They hate sharks.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:32.500
They see a shark and they fucking like ram it with their noses until the shark is good

01:19:32.500 --> 01:19:33.500
and dead.

01:19:33.500 --> 01:19:34.500
They don't.

01:19:34.500 --> 01:19:38.000
It's not about anything other than sort of like hatred.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:44.000
And if a person's drowning, Andy, if a person's drowning, sexist or not.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:48.000
And I don't know if they don't do it for women.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:52.000
But they tend to like save drowning humans.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:55.000
Like they see us thrashing around and they're kind of like, what are you doing?

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
Shit.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:02.000
Also, also maybe seals do that possibly too.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:06.000
That sounded like I just made that up, which I kind of did.

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:10.000
I'm basing that off of the documentary, The Bridge, which is about other people jumping

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:11.000
off the Golden Gate Bridge.

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:12.000
Don't woo that.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
The saddest document.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:17.000
So the director is here.

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:20.000
We captured a lot of suicides on camera.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:26.000
This one's for the crew, John Perignon.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:33.000
In that movie, there's one kid who jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge and he's, I mean,

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:37.000
most of the people are not in the documentary talking about their experience jumping off

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
the Golden Gate Bridge, but he is because he survived.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:42.000
He broke his whole body hitting the water.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
And by the way.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
I found God at the end of it.

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:52.000
Well, yeah, that was kind of a, yeah, he jumped and he broke his legs and his back and all

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:53.000
this shit in the water.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:57.000
And then he was like, he's like, oh my God, I failed to kill myself.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:58.000
I'm now drowning.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:02.000
And this thing underneath him kept bumping him and keeping his head above water.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:05.000
And he believes it was a seal or he described it to someone.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:06.000
They said it was a seal.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:13.000
And then he goes, and if that's not proof of Jesus, I don't know what it is.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:20.000
What a wasted opportunity to become a really passionate marine biologist.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:25.000
I guess he took the easier path.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
The human eyes too complicated.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:28.000
Fuck it.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
Intelligent design.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
Maybe become an optician.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
Did I say that word right?

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:35.000
Okay.

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:36.000
All right.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:40.000
So dolphins are sexists.

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
Jews are great.

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:43.000
Christians are great.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:46.000
They just, they just waste too much time having lock ins.

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:49.000
And dolphins are Jews.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:50.000
Dolphins are.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:51.000
Dolphins are Jews.

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:52.000
Yeah.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:53.000
Dolphins are built entirely under water.

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
We landed on it at some point.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:56.000
Dolphins are Jews.

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
Do you not say Muslims are sharks?

01:21:58.000 --> 01:21:59.000
Yeah.

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
But no, I did not mean to say Muslims are sharks.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:02.000
I don't want to say that.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:03.000
It sure was.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:04.000
Hey, I have one last question.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
I mean, like literally.

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:11.000
You know how giant squids and killer whales are fighting all the time?

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:12.000
No.

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:16.000
Like, look it up.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:17.000
Yeah.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:18.000
Look it up.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:21.000
They know what I'm talking about.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:22.000
You're talking about.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
I mean, we all get it.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:25.000
They fight all the time.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:26.000
Yeah.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:27.000
They fight all the time on the sign fight.

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:31.000
No one's ever seen it, but there's pictures of it.

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:32.000
Megasquids.

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:33.000
Is Debbie Gibson in the frame?

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
Who are the good guy?

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:36.000
Who's the good guy?

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:37.000
And who's the bad guy in that?

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:38.000
Between a giant squid.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:42.000
Between a mammal and a fucking ridiculous fish monster?

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
I don't think a shark is a mammal.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:45.000
They're killer whales.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:46.000
They're mammals, man.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:47.000
Oh, killer whales.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:48.000
You automatically just...

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:51.000
The sperm whales.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:54.000
They look like a killer whale, the pictures I've seen.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:57.000
You're always going to be on a mammal's side.

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:58.000
You always have to be one.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:22:59.000
Yes.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:00.000
Why?

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:01.000
In a fight.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
Okay, let me explain this to what he needs to be explained.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
It's the opposite of racist.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:06.000
What?

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
It's a human.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:12.000
If a human is fighting a chimp, side with the human.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:13.000
Wait.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:17.000
If two chimps are fighting, I don't know.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
I'll get back to you.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:22.000
Side with the bonobo.

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:26.000
If a gorilla and a chimp are fighting, side with the chimp.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:32.000
If a squid and a whale are fighting, side with the whale.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
You can side with your branch of evolution.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:39.000
If chimps bite your balls off, gorillas do sign language in pet kittens.

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:40.000
But they're fighting.

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:41.000
What the fuck?

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:42.000
One.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:45.000
And your pig gorilla does sign language in pet kittens.

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:52.000
I'm sure if they bother to teach others, they catch on.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:53.000
What about this?

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:56.000
If a human's fighting a chimp, side with the human thing.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:59.000
I feel like that's misguided in a lot of circumstances.

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:00.000
What do you mean?

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:05.000
I mean, there's a zookeeper looking human, and he's got a pitchfork,

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:09.000
and he's fighting with the chimp, and you gotta side with the chimp sometimes.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:10.000
They're being abused, maybe.

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:11.000
Oh, yeah.

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:12.000
Oh, yeah, you're right.

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:13.000
Yeah, you're right.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:16.000
I mean, if they were dropped in the arena, sure.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
I mean, all of the humans.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:19.000
Yeah.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:22.000
This was battle war.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:26.000
I guess that's when I was picturing.

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:30.000
Is that this situation was happening more organically.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:34.000
Like, maybe in the world's strangest bar.

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
Yeah, just like, you don't know.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:40.000
Like, they were playing darts for a while, and then they erupted into, you know,

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:43.000
the chimp's got a broken bottle, and the guy's like saying,

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:46.000
I called a cab, and Mike, you always do this.

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:49.000
Like, separate them.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:53.000
But ultimately, like, we gotta be for humans, right?

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
You're saying we gotta be to the closest to our genetic.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:59.000
Yeah, and then once you have your shit together as a species,

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:03.000
then you go, okay, now we'll start dipping and dapping

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:08.000
and don't know what's happening among all these other things.

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
Now, if you're in PETA and stuff, you're listening,

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
you're going, you're fucking insane.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
You wouldn't say retarded, probably.

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:17.000
Because if you're in PETA, you're probably more progressive,

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:20.000
and your vocabulary is probably not as crass,

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:24.000
and my sister's retarded, so fuck you.

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:31.000
But I just mean, like, we gotta, here's what I'm saying.

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
There's homeless people.

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
Fuck giraffes.

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:38.000
That's all I'm saying.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:41.000
Until there's no homeless people, fuck giraffes.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:45.000
I don't care how long their necks get.

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:48.000
They're just horses with long necks.

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:52.000
I don't, I'm not saying Spencer's right.

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:56.000
If you walk into a bar, there's a guy whipping a giraffe.

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:59.000
Like, maybe tell your friend with the whip to, like,

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:02.000
okay, you've had too many.

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:03.000
He's not worth it.

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:04.000
That's what I'd say.

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
He's not worth it, Tony.

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
He's just a giraffe.

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:11.000
I don't even know how he got in here.

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:12.000
He must have been lower in.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:13.000
It's the lowest bar.

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:16.000
This bar has the highest ceiling I've ever been in.

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:17.000
All right.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:21.000
Okay, so we should play, let's, I got my character sheets.

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:22.000
So here's how it works, Paula.

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:23.000
You get these sheets.

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
They have scribbles all over them.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:26.000
We were drunk.

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:27.000
We look at them.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
We don't know what we're doing.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
If you see something on there that's like,

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
it says I have shoes, you can say.

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:36.000
Spencer will generally, like, tell you,

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:39.000
like, if you want to do something now, you can do something.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:43.000
Sometimes that he forgets, but here it passes.

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:44.000
You're Dignity Sarsgard.

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
You are a paladin.

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
You're for truth and justice.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:51.000
And you'll probably want to take the top two, Dave,

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:54.000
and pass the next to Ryan.

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:57.000
I think I messed up the order when the paper was...

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:58.000
Look okay to me.

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
Just left hand to Ryan.

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
Okay buddy.

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:03.000
It's like Twister.

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:04.000
Thanks, Mr.

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
Yeah.

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:09.000
Master.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:10.000
What?

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:11.000
I'm a master.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:14.000
I'll call you, I'll call you master.

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:15.000
Please do.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:20.000
I touched the ice, I touched all the ice.

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:21.000
I don't have time to fuck around.

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:22.000
I'm touching all the ice.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:23.000
Is that bad to touch the ice?

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
Oh yeah, it's unhygienic.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:28.000
I mean, the alcohol take care of that probably, right?

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:29.000
Yeah.

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
I don't know if that's scientifically accurate.

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:32.000
It sounds good though.

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:35.000
I don't think I'm going to get music probably,

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:36.000
but I should...

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:37.000
Oh shit!

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
Well, I mean, you...

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:40.000
Whatever.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
I touched all the ice.

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
I took all the ice.

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:47.000
I don't know if these guys are ready.

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:48.000
Oh, we could use some ice.

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:49.000
Dance in a round.

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:50.000
If I've learned anything,

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
edit this part out, let us get our drinks.

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:55.000
That's what I was thinking.

01:27:55.000 --> 01:28:00.000
So, do you guys see that sports thing?

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:01.000
Two points, right?

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:02.000
Two points.

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
I didn't think they were going to get those points,

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:05.000
but then...

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:06.000
Two of them.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:07.000
Right there.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:08.000
Plain as day.

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:09.000
Oh man.

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:10.000
This is like a sports corner.

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
I'm stealing your bit, Harmon.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:13.000
Steal it.

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:17.000
This is the least enthusiastic sports corner.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:18.000
Hit it.

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:19.000
Alright.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:20.000
So, are we good then?

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:21.000
I mean...

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:22.000
Yep.

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:23.000
Are we all...

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
Let me turn on my iPad.

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
I don't know what the fuck's wrong with me, you guys.

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:28.000
I'm sorry.

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:29.000
Well, you're high or sick.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:30.000
I'm just sick.

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:35.000
I always cool off by 937.

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:38.000
Last time on Harmontown.

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:41.000
Our heroes had reunited outside

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:45.000
after leaving Father Tinder to inform Mrs. Darmvahn

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:48.000
of her husband's untimely demise.

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:52.000
The gang was approached by Spizwad, the gnome.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:53.000
And the gnome.

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:54.000
Oh yes, Spizzbulb.

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:57.000
And the gnome offered them a place to stay.

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
Up in his tower.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:02.000
And the group decided they needed to take...

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
There, the group decided that they needed to break

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
into Father's Tinder's house.

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:07.000
Jesus Christ.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:10.000
To look for clues and steal his stuff.

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:14.000
Spizzbulb gave them a bundle of cloth and they departed.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:17.000
While infiltrating the house, Quark heard a noise

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:20.000
and rushed upstairs to see a small ninja

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
attacking Father Tinder before escaping.

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:25.000
After tripping and falling on his blade,

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:28.000
trying to apprehend the assailant, Quark was pissed.

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:31.000
And sexually assaulted the beaten, bloody old priest

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
while Sharpie gave chase.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
Pursuing the assassin.

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
Dignity Sarsgard heard the commotion

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
and discovered Quark's sodomy.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:42.000
Removing the raging barbarian and locking him in a closet.

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:45.000
Sharpie tracked the ninja to Darvon's house

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
which was ruined by magic.

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
Inside he cornered the offender

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
who revealed himself to be Spizzbulb,

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
the friendly gnome from before.

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:54.000
Unbelievable.

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
Sharpie attacked.

01:29:56.000 --> 01:30:00.000
But Spizzbulb seemed to avoid all harm with a magical barrier.

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
Sharpie was outmatched.

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:05.000
As dignity ran off to aid our heroes,

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:09.000
Quark stewed swearing revenge on the paladin who stopped him.

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
But could our heroes pull it together

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:14.000
to fight off a super-powered Spizzbulb?

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:17.000
Or would they all perish alone?

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:18.000
Like me.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:19.000
Find out.

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
Like you, Harmonytown.

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
What? Oh my God.

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
What the hell was that?

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
It just did a...

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
Some Hunter S. Thompson...

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
an introduction.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:34.000
It sounded like it went with the music.

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:37.000
It slipped a little tragedy in there.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
Jesus.

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
I don't know if we can play.

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
It's gonna take you somewhere quiet.

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
I'll just role-play up some happiness.

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:50.000
Yeah, so I saw our friend Spizzbulb.

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
I was trying to chase him,

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:55.000
but then I came across frozen people or something.

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:58.000
Yeah, they were frozen in this like hunk of force magic.

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
Are we all together again?

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
The characters, the players?

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
You guys are racing.

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
You're racing to reunite, so that's happening.

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
You guys, you all reunite.

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
You're in the top floor of a two-story house.

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
You're in this guy...

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
No, you're in the bottom floor.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
Sorry, I have a two-story house.

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
There's this guy.

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
He's a little gnome wearing Ninja gear going...

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:25.000
And he's just menacing.

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
And he's facing down Sharpie,

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
and he looks like he's got the upper hand.

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
Sharpie's running towards you guys

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
and you enter this room.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
You don't know what's going on.

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
That's a...

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
So I had to...

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
You fill them in as they're seeing what's happening.

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
Spizzbulb...

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
It was Spizzbulb.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
Spizzbulb fucking tilled Tinder.

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
Are you all filled in now?

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:57.000
The guy we were going to investigate

01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:00.000
because he was too into juice.

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
You remember?

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
There's a guy who's like the mayor of the town

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
who was like really into juice

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
and we talked to him a lot about juice

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
and then we were suspicious of him.

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:14.000
So we did a stealth operation at his house

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
to see if we could find out more about him,

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
but we found him getting killed.

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
He wasn't dead though, he's still alive.

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
Is he here?

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
He's back at his place.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
Alright, back to Father Tinders.

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
You're running away?

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
Is Spizzbulb still here?

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
Spizzbulb, why?

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
Because I'm fucked up.

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000
You never trust a gnome.

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
Gnomes are all evil.

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
I deny it,

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
but the way Jeff acted last week...

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
That's racist.

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
I say it.

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
No.

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
Wait, I'm a gnome?

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
Yeah, you're a gnome.

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
Fuck that.

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
Yeah, keep going.

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
I'm good.

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
Are gnomes like the dolphins

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
or the sharks in this game?

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
Someone said sharks.

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
Are all gnomes like ninjas?

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
No, some are.

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
Some are.

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:26.000
Some are like humans.

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
You know?

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
But he's like, you guys are gonna die!

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
Why?

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
He starts casting magics.

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
God damn it.

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
I feel deja vu here.

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
Didn't I teleport to behind him?

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
You tried to fear him.

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
He didn't get feared.

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
Then you started running away.

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
Then your friends showed up.

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
Can I teleport to behind him again?

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000
Alright, well I want to shock and grasp him

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
before he manages to cast whatever he's casting.

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
Alright, well, that doesn't happen.

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
He manages to cast whatever he's casting.

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
Fuck.

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
So he waves his arms magically

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
and you see four shining pillars

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
of force, energy

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
looking kind of like great columns

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
almost as large and as heavy as stone pillars.

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
And they launch

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
towards you kind of slowly.

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
They're easy to dodge,

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:20.000
but let's see if you do.

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:24.000
You do.

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
I dodged.

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
Yeah, the slow moving pillars are easy to dodge

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
and they smash into the walls behind you

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
but all of you manage to nimbly dodge

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
out of the way.

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
He's like, fuck!

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
Hey, nice pillars, dick.

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
I'll respond on my turn.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
Here's some alternate names

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
for those things.

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
Missers.

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
Infectual glowing

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
turds.

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
Dodge

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
Practicers.

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
He writes that one down.

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
Now,

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
witness the power of this fully

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
armed and operational

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:14.000
shocking grasp.

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
You lunge towards him

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
shockingly and your hands

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
are stopped by an irresistible

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
invisible wave of force energy.

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
It's like some sort of shield.

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
Your hands burn as electricity

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
dissipates across this shield.

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
Ow!

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:36.000
He's like, you can't touch me.

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
A white barrier kind of

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
appears in front of him

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
and shivers out of existence.

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
Fuck this guy.

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
What's this guy's problem?

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
What's going on here?

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
I'm a gnome!

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
We're evil.

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
I'm a gnome.

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
He's a self-loathing gnome.

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
You should relate to him as a gnome.

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
Get on his level.

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
What's up, man?

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
What's your problem?

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
I don't know what you're talking about!

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
You're gonna die!

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
Once it's my turn!

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
Can I heal you?

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
The bad guy?

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
Did I get wounded?

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
By the shocking grasp.

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
You just felt it not working

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
on the shield.

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
Thank you, Paula.

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
You're just yelling at this guy

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
apparently, Ryan,

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
and he's not having it.

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
He's like, I don't know!

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
Am I speaking to him

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
in gnome language?

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
That might make a difference.

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
What are you trying to do?

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
I'm just trying to connect with this guy.

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
But not where he's coming from.

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
This is what happens when views play D&D.

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
They're too heady.

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
I want to relate to him on his level.

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
I just want to know what's going on.

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
Why is he attacking us?

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
We've spent more time doing worse.

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
This might not be a bad option.

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
What do you want to say?

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
Where are you coming from?

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
What did we do to you?

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
You didn't do anything!

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000
I'm just a terrible person!

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
Nobody's just a terrible person!

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
Nomes are all of them!

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
Not me!

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
You're probably wrong.

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
He wants you to look within.

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
You just feel insulted because I

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
Steffen the gnome

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
have you all tricked?

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
So your name is Steffen?

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
That's Stubnortz?

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
No, Stubnortz!

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
Stubnortz the gnome!

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
You're possessed by someone.

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
You're not even a gnome.

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
Say something about gnomes that only gnomes would gnome.

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
They...

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
What?

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
They love

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
light exercise.

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
Bullshit!

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
You're not a gnome!

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
I'd say let's get him, but he's really powerful.

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
He keeps kicking our asses.

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
You're not a gnome.

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
Knock it off, the jig's up.

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
Oh, it's not up.

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
It is up.

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
The jig is up.

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
He's still trying to act like you guys

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
haven't purged

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
his deceptions.

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
We can act like that all we want.

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
We've purged your deceptions.

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:28.000
Well, I disagree.

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
Motherfucker,

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
your deceptions are out the door, man.

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
No!

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
No.

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000
What if I say to him...

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
Come on.

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
Is that your whole turn?

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
What if I rub his shoulders?

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
That's it. You put all your energy

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
for your whole combat turn into that move.

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
And then, yeah, then roll for it.

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
What's your diplomacy

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
or your charisma if you don't have a

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
diplomacy?

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
Me?

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
Total?

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
Ten?

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
That's not bad.

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
Yeah, I put all ten of that into...

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
You're like Lou Diamond Phillips level charisma.

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
You're no Daniel Craig.

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
What's the scale?

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
I don't know.

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
What did you say again?

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
Come on.

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
He...

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
He stands there

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
and he just kind of drops his hands

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
and he's like, okay.

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
I knew it!

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
I fucking knew it, dude!

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
Oh, I knew it!

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
Fuck you!

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
Come on!

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
He put his character sheet down.

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
That was a critical hit.

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
That's what happens.

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
So

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
he drops his hands

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
and he's like, okay.

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
And then he does like one of these

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000
where he waves his hands in front of his face.

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
And poof!

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
He magically changes into Father Tinder.

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
I knew it! I fucking knew it!

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
I fucking knew it and I was going to say it.

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
Yeah, you knew it now.

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
If I said it, you would have changed it.

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
You would have changed it because you would have been like,

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
holy fuck, Harmon's awesome.

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
You fuckers, you might have figured out

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
what your ass is because that's what I do.

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
Father Tinder, in the name of a man

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000
who was buried up to his neck by nobles

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
for the shard of power you have

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
on your titty,

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
I

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
Sharpie Buttsalot

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
and the

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
wrecking crew.

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
So help me, God.

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
So help me, Jesus Christ.

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
A deity

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
you've never heard of

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
but who you're going to meet soon

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
I am going to kick your fucking ass.

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
Okay.

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
I'm not, I'm not very,

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
it's a nice speech.

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
And why, why were you

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
so into juice?

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
What's wrong with juice?

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
Why were you so into it?

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
I mean you guys have juice in you.

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
I never drank it.

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
I didn't drink it.

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
You never drank it.

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000
We'll see who drank juice.

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
Activate juice.

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
You guys feel sick

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
except not, not Sharpie.

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
You didn't drink it.

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000
The rest of you guys feel

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000
physically ill as the juice activates.

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:40.000
It's a weird sentence.

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
All right, well the juice activates

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
but other than a mild upset stomach

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
you seem completely unaffected.

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
It's just delicious.

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000
Happens every day.

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000
All right.

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000
Literally feels like eating too much Thai food.

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
Just let me know when it's my turn.

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
Paula's turn.

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000
Paula, just attack this guy.

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
Am I not made to heal some of us

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
we've had since my gym?

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000
No, don't worry about us.

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000
That's very kind of you.

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000
Can I not use some diplomacy

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000
to sort this guy out?

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
I would say just physically

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000
beat his ass.

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
Do you have a spellcraft?

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
That's a skill.

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
Let's see.

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
What do you got under weapons?

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
I've got swords.

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
Yeah, let's slash him up a bit.

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
Give him a Glasgow

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000
Give him a Glasgow smile.

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
Give him a Glasgow smile.

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
You swing your sword

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
but it bounces off his weird barrier.

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
It flashes white and fizzles away.

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
Barrier is a dumb barrier.

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
Can I throw an axe at him?

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
I think it's not your turn anymore.

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
That thing might bounce off.

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.000
I want to put it at Dave's turn

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
just because he only set a short thing

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
or maybe Ridley's turn

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
I made the dude not be a gnome.

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000
I know.

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
Time-wise, it didn't take much time.

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
He was a gnome and now he's not one.

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000
The scale of your deeds was grand

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000
although the time scale is not.

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000
That's all I'm saying.

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000
Okay, cool. So, what's up?

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000
You're going to double down.

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000
How about it'll be Ridley's turn.

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000
How about Ridley's turn?

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
What species is father Tinder?

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000
He's a human.

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
He's got a force field around him.

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000
What can I do

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
to have anything that can get through a force field?

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000
I don't know, man.

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000
Magic?

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.000
I don't think you have magic.

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000
What do you mean you don't think?

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000
Well, I mean you have spell-like ability.

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000
What does somebody yell out in back?

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000
What is that thing that he gave us?

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
It doesn't seem like he can give us something helpful, but...

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
This guy gave us something?

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
Oh, it's baseball gave it to us before.

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000
Yeah.

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
What is this shit that he gave you?

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000
You got something wrapped in a black cloth or something?

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
I'll unwrap it and I'll use it against this guy.

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
You unwrap the black sackcloth

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
and it looks black like a void.

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000
It looks like a hole.

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000
You're holding a hole in your hand.

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000
Alright.

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000
It's a hole.

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
I'm going to throw it at him.

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000
You throw it at him and it hits him like a blanket

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
and it just kind of falls onto the floor.

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
Like you got hit by a blanket

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000
that then fell on the floor.

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
Somebody push him in.

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
It's a portable hole.

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000
You hear the slow warrings of machinery

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000
coming from inside the hole

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000
on the floor.

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000
Can I push him in?

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
I'll say let's try it.

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000
You try to push him in

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000
and you do.

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000
Yeah!

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000
That feels good.

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000
Wait a minute.

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000
What happened to him when he fell in the hole?

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000
He falls about four feet

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000
and you see his feet

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000
they're still sticking out of the hole

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000
when he hits bottom.

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000
He pulls himself to his feet.

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000
What do you mean? The hole is four feet?

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000
It's like he's in a waiting pool maybe.

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000
What about the machine noises?

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000
Somebody grab the hole.

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000
Grab it and fucking wad it up.

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
Can I close it up?

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
Yeah.

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
There was worrying machinery though.

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
We'll figure that out later.

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
Trying to pull up the hole

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000
from the ground.

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
You trip and fall into the hole with Father Tinder.

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
Oh shit.

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
Just because you said that?

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000
No, it's because I rolled a one.

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
Yeah, because I said it.

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
This whole thing is because I said it.

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
I just say stuff up there.

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
What did you think in your head

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
if I roll this number?

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
It's rules.

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000
What are you, Neo?

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000
You're going to decode the fucking reality?

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
In this portable hole

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
you can see what looks like

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000
just a small wicker basket

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000
and a slowly inflating balloon.

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000
What?

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000
Is it a helium balloon?

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000
It looks like it.

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000
You can't tell by eyeballing the gas.

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
It seems like

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
it seems like something

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
that definitely requires explaining.

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
So I'm in the hole,

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
this guy's in the hole,

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
a wicker basket and a balloon

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
and then machine sounds.

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000
Oh my god.

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
Can I ask what's going on?

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
To who?

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000
I don't know.

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000
To the camera?

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
Like you're a flinch stone animal?

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
Give a John Krasinski look to the camera.

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000
It's like a

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000
It cuts to a talking head of you later.

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000
I didn't know what was going on.

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000
They wanted to be in the hole.

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000
I guess they got in the hole.

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000
Where's this fizz gig guy?

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000
He's in the hole with you.

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000
What's he doing? Is he in the basket?

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000
Is the balloon bouncing on his head?

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000
Technically speaking, a lot of stuff is happening

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000
at the same time.

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000
When I ain't going to move, I fucking fold

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.000
that hole up like a napkin.

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000
I'm still in it!

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000
I get out of the hole!

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000
I get out of the hole!

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000
Alright, well it's not your turn,

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000
but you try to fold up the hole,

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
but Father Tinder holds the edges of the hole

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
down and it doesn't get picked up

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
completely.

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
It's a real thing.

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000
I can't headbutt him?

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000
Well I guess you could try, sure.

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000
Headbutt.

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
You headbutt him!

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000
You headbutt him right in the head

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
and he gets a bloody nose.

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
Top of the head, hardest part of the body.

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000
Brian Dennehy.

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
Penitentiary.

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000
You deal three damage to him.

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000
It's unarmed combat.

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000
You're a wizard.

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000
But also he lets go of the edge of the hole

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000
because it hurts his nose.

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
No, no.

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000
He's tough.

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000
He leaps out of the hole

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000
and he's like, you guys,

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000
you broke through my barrier,

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000
but it'll never happen again.

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000
Uh,

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000
your nose.

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000
You guys broke through my nose,

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000
but it'll never happen again.

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
He starts waving

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
his hands around, creating,

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000
creating a large blob

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
of white force energy.

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000
It looks like creamy, rich semen.

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.000
No!

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000
Just like Dad used to make.

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:34.000
What the fuck?

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
Dad?

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000
But then stopped when the city asked him to.

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000
He hurls it towards you.

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000
He's like multiple migs.

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000
It slows, it slows,

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.000
it slowly rolls

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.000
towards you through the air,

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.000
and you try to dodge, but somehow it

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000
reaches out with weird pseudopods

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000
and grabs you guys,

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000
and you don't save successfully,

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000
even though this is flat.

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000
Don't worry, don't worry about that.

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000
All right, everybody takes

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000
15 damage.

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000
It's burning, searing force energy,

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000
grabs you by the legs,

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000
and pulls you to the ground.

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
This, wait, what?

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
What pulls us? The semen cloud?

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000
Yeah, a cloud of...

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000
It's more like a semen amoeba.

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
It's shit in, like, Donnie Darko

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000
where it's like that Capri Sun, Alex Mack stuff

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.000
that, like, comes out

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000
out of people.

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000
That's what it is, but more glowy.

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000
So it's like a creamy white, glowy

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000
Donnie Darko Capri Sun

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
coming towards us.

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
And it's going slow, but like, can I duck?

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000
Well, you tried,

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000
but somehow it lashed out and hit you anyway.

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000
So it, like, starts moving fast

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000
when I start ducking.

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000
I just want to make sure I know how I'm being dealt

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000
with points.

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000
I guess it's not moving that fast,

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000
but yet you're just unable to dodge,

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000
really. Like, I'm so

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000
impressed by it.

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000
Like, I've never, even though I'm in this world,

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000
I've never seen anything like it before.

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000
I think you're just, we were maybe treating it too casually

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000
and then you just realized too late, maybe?

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000
Like, maybe it's like the first time I saw

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000
Donnie Darko and actually thought it was good.

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.000
It was, like, blinded by it.

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000
Just because of the soundtrack?

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000
Yeah. It is amazing.

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000
Wow, yeah.

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000
I do think it's kind of funny.

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000
People run in circles.

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000
Very, very mad world. I get it.

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000
Okay, I just wanted to know.

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
Thanks. Thank you, Master.

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000
Is he still waving his hands?

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000
What's up?

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000
Is he still waving his hands around?

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.000
He stopped that after you guys got hit

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000
by his attack.

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000
Okay, so he stopped waving his hands

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.000
once the semen was generated.

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000
Is he now going to take a nap?

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000
Because I say,

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000
we get him while he's napping.

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000
I'm basing this on my spellcraft

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000
knowledge.

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000
I think that spell may have drained him.

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000
Yeah, this is like a,

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000
this is a semen club. We could hit him during his

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.000
refractory period.

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000
Tell me when that is,

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.000
because I got something for him.

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.000
Is he 18?

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000
Or...

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.000
He's an old dude.

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000
He's an old guy.

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000
All right, good. So we have 48 minutes.

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.000
Okay, good.

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.000
Anyways,

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.000
whose turn is it?

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.000
I'll play your turn, maybe.

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000
I fucking charge. I charge at him.

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000
No, I don't.

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.000
What's bull's strength?

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.000
That makes you stronger.

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000
Okay, so can I cast that

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000
on the run? Can I charge?

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
Can I charge at him and cast bull's strength

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000
and like pile into him like a football player?

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000
Just to like knock him to the ground?

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000
Yeah.

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.000
Yeah, yeah, totally.

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.000
I totally do that.

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.000
Bull's strength!

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000
All right, bull's strength.

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000
Casting bull's strength,

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000
you feel yourself get four points

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000
of strength stronger as you

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
barrel into him directly.

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:14.000
Let's see if that pans out.

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.000
I'm trying to immobilize him.

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.000
Like, put my knees on his biceps

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000
like my brother did in the front yard

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000
and then I'm going to hack lewis

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000
and suck them back into my mouth

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000
just before they hit my face.

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000
His face.

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000
And 30 years later,

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.000
I'm not going to earn that much.

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.000
So, yeah.

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000
Launching his knee,

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000
your knees directly into his chest.

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000
You pin him to the ground underneath you.

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:48.000
Don't do any damage though.

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000
And I just like, I put my hands in his face

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.000
like I got my knees on his biceps

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000
and I just like slap into the face.

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000
I'm not touching you, I'm not touching you.

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.000
You should do stop hitting yourself with him.

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:00.000
Right, yeah, stop hitting yourself.

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.000
He doesn't stop hitting himself.

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.000
Yes!

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000
I look at these guys and I'm like,

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000
this is the best.

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000
Alright.

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.000
Can we use some shackles?

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000
What's up?

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:16.000
Can we use some shackles?

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000
Yeah, yeah, you can definitely try.

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.000
You got shackles?

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:22.000
Yeah.

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:24.000
Good looking out.

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.000
Try as you might to restrain him.

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.000
He's squiggling.

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:30.000
Struggling is the word I was looking for.

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:32.000
Struggling.

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.000
Like some sort of squiggly line may happen.

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.000
Yeah.

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:38.000
And he's flailing his limbs too hard.

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.000
He's flailing his limbs too hard

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:42.000
to be contained.

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.000
He's just flipping around

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000
like a golden retriever.

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:50.000
Wait, what?

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.000
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's successful.

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000
You're slapping him.

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.000
You're slapping him.

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:58.000
He's flailing around.

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.000
Alright.

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:02.000
Alright, so he's been slapped around a bunch.

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000
He's pinned down.

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000
He's pinned down, but he can't be shackled

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.000
because he's too flailing around.

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.000
That's fine, he doesn't need to be in shackles.

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.000
Can I?

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.000
I want to stab this motherfucker with a poison dagger.

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:18.000
I want to get on top of him

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:20.000
and stab him

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000
in the heart with a poison dagger.

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.000
Can I?

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.000
Don't be afraid to get right behind me

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:28.000
and reach over like Kelly McGillis

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:32.000
in the Top Gun poster.

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:34.000
I want to get behind you

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.000
to me more and go...

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.000
Well, you're like Patrick Swayze.

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:40.000
I want to stab someone with a poison dagger

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:42.000
to me, you know what I mean?

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.000
Allow me.

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:46.000
But you're Swayze then,

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:48.000
if you're behind me.

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.000
Alright.

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.000
You got it too.

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.000
You lunge towards him with your knife

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000
and do that Patrick Swayze thing.

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:00.000
But it's all

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.000
style over substance and he just kind of

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.000
graze his robe maybe.

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:06.000
Shouldn't you try to do the Swayze?

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:08.000
Common...

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.000
Common problem.

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.000
Common mistake.

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:14.000
Alright, bring us home, Ridley.

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.000
He's calling for a closer here.

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.000
Closing move, Ridley.

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.000
I plant my feet.

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.000
No reference to any movie from the 90s.

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.000
Smart, smart.

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:26.000
I pull out my flaming sword.

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:30.000
And I fucking swing it right at his head.

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.000
You do that.

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.000
You hit him.

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:42.000
And?

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.000
In the side of the head.

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:48.000
The weak side?

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:50.000
It's still the head.

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.000
It's not serious.

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.000
It's a sword into the head.

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000
A flaming sword.

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:58.000
We're looking for a closer here.

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.000
We got work in the morning.

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:02.000
Well, I'm sorry.

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.000
He's just doing a standard non-hilarious attack.

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.000
Anyway...

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:08.000
Does he graze brain?

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:10.000
He hits him right in the head dealing

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:12.000
22 damage.

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:18.000
Is that a closer?

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.000
It's from the wound.

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.000
And then white light streams from his wound.

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.000
Consuming everything.

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:26.000
You guys all can't see for a momentarily.

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.000
Fine by me.

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:30.000
I can't see.

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.000
Can anybody see? I can't see.

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.000
I have a feeling this guy's going down.

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:36.000
I can't see yet.

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:38.000
Do you say that blindly?

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:40.000
Yeah.

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:42.000
We hear him making noises, probably.

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.000
Yeah.

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.000
Oh, the side of my head.

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000
I'm dying.

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.000
I'm dying.

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000
Shard of power.

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000
Lend me your strength.

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.000
Is that the...

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000
Is there more on the pad?

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:04.000
Wait.

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:10.000
All right.

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:12.000
Thank you, Paolo.

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:14.000
Thank you, Andy, the dolphin expert.

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:16.000
Thank you, Lawrence and Ryan Ridley

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.000
for a very Jewish,

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.000
very edifying Harmontown.

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000
You're welcome.

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.000
Thank you, Zach and Dustin in the booth.

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:26.000
Thank you, NerdMelt.

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.000
I don't know.

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:45.000
See you later.

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:04.000
That's why you will not survive.
