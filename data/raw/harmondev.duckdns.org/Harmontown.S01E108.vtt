{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:29.000\nHi, hi everybody, hello, I'm Elisha, welcome to Harmontown, I'm your cop trolling,\n\n00:29.000 --> 00:39.000\nnow, welcome to the stage, your mayor, Ann Harmon.\n\n00:39.000 --> 00:52.000\nAlright, thank you. Another big crowd. You haven't been here lately.\n\n00:52.000 --> 00:53.000\nNo, I haven't.\n\n00:53.000 --> 00:55.000\nThere's a lot of big crowds lately.\n\n00:55.000 --> 00:56.000\nThat's good.\n\n00:56.000 --> 00:56.500\nGood.\n\n00:56.500 --> 00:58.040\nSo that Yahoo influence.\n\n00:58.040 --> 00:59.540\nYep.\n\n00:59.540 --> 01:02.920\nA lot of people with those Yahoo email addresses,\n\n01:02.920 --> 01:04.680\nyou know, I'm doing a TV show for Yahoo now.\n\n01:04.680 --> 01:05.840\nI don't even know if you know that.\n\n01:05.840 --> 01:07.040\nI haven't talked to you in a long time.\n\n01:07.040 --> 01:07.040\nI know that.\n\n01:07.040 --> 01:07.840\nI do know that.\n\n01:07.840 --> 01:08.340\nOK.\n\n01:08.340 --> 01:11.160\nI don't know how it's associated with Netanyahu, though.\n\n01:11.160 --> 01:12.160\nNo.\n\n01:12.160 --> 01:15.800\nI mean, I don't think they ever claimed that it should be.\n\n01:15.800 --> 01:17.040\nThat was just a coincidence.\n\n01:17.040 --> 01:18.880\nWe're all tied into Netanyahu, though.\n\n01:18.880 --> 01:21.000\nI mean, everyone's tied to Netanyahu, yes.\n\n01:21.000 --> 01:23.320\nBecause he's starting World War III, so.\n\n01:23.320 --> 01:24.520\nIt's a serious issue.\n\n01:24.520 --> 01:30.760\nAnd you should apply for the appropriate email domain\n\n01:30.760 --> 01:32.640\nto reflect that.\n\n01:32.640 --> 01:34.760\nGuest Comptroller Duncan Tressall, everybody.\n\n01:34.760 --> 01:35.260\nOh!\n\n01:35.260 --> 01:35.760\nOh!\n\n01:35.760 --> 01:36.260\nOh!\n\n01:36.260 --> 01:36.760\nOh!\n\n01:36.760 --> 01:37.260\nOh!\n\n01:37.260 --> 01:37.760\nOh!\n\n01:37.760 --> 01:38.260\nOh!\n\n01:38.260 --> 01:38.760\nOh!\n\n01:38.760 --> 01:40.120\nHello.\n\n01:40.120 --> 01:42.600\nJeff is in Nashville.\n\n01:42.600 --> 01:43.640\nWe don't know why.\n\n01:43.640 --> 01:45.000\nJeff's just in Nashville.\n\n01:45.000 --> 01:45.800\nHe's just hanging out.\n\n01:45.800 --> 01:46.800\nHe's Instagramming.\n\n01:46.800 --> 01:50.480\nHe's dicking around.\n\n01:50.480 --> 01:53.080\nCaptioning things like, I'm finally home.\n\n01:53.080 --> 01:56.080\nSo, so, fuck you.\n\n01:56.080 --> 01:57.080\nFine.\n\n01:57.080 --> 01:58.080\nGo home.\n\n01:58.080 --> 02:01.080\nYou really don't know why he's there?\n\n02:01.080 --> 02:02.080\nNo.\n\n02:02.080 --> 02:03.080\nI never know.\n\n02:03.080 --> 02:04.080\nI don't ask.\n\n02:04.080 --> 02:08.080\nThe thing with Jeff is, you don't want to encourage him.\n\n02:08.080 --> 02:13.080\nI just, you don't want to, you don't want to ask him things and go to him with needs.\n\n02:13.080 --> 02:14.080\nHe just abuses it.\n\n02:14.080 --> 02:21.080\nThat's what they said about John Wayne Gacy.\n\n02:21.080 --> 02:24.080\nThey said that you don't want to encourage him.\n\n02:24.080 --> 02:26.080\nDon't ask him questions.\n\n02:26.080 --> 02:28.080\nHe likes to dress like a clown.\n\n02:28.080 --> 02:29.080\nHang out with kids.\n\n02:29.080 --> 02:30.080\nIt's fine.\n\n02:30.080 --> 02:31.080\nBut also, don't encourage him.\n\n02:31.080 --> 02:34.080\nI've been a lot of people encourage John Wayne Gacy.\n\n02:34.080 --> 02:35.080\nThat's the thing.\n\n02:35.080 --> 02:39.080\nLike, if you encourage Jeff Davis, you're going to have a John Wayne Gacy situation in your\n\n02:39.080 --> 02:41.080\nhands in like two weeks tops.\n\n02:41.080 --> 02:43.080\nAll right.\n\n02:43.080 --> 02:45.080\nSo, what are we talking about tonight?\n\n02:45.080 --> 02:46.080\nLet's see here.\n\n02:46.080 --> 02:50.080\nBring up my Evernote.\n\n02:50.080 --> 02:54.080\nOne thing I would like to talk about is the Uber ride that I had to work today.\n\n02:54.080 --> 03:00.080\nI had to, I had to drive to work and didn't want to drive, took an Uber.\n\n03:00.080 --> 03:05.080\nAnd the guy, sometimes the Uber app, you can see the black car and you can watch.\n\n03:05.080 --> 03:07.080\nSometimes the guy, it's foreshadowing.\n\n03:07.080 --> 03:09.080\nLike, you know, you got a bad guy.\n\n03:09.080 --> 03:14.080\nIt's like the black car is like driving around in circles all around.\n\n03:14.080 --> 03:18.080\nLike, just going around your house, just watching it.\n\n03:18.080 --> 03:22.080\nLike, if you're watching like a six-year-old play Pac-Man, there's like this car, I can't\n\n03:22.080 --> 03:23.080\ngo around.\n\n03:23.080 --> 03:24.080\nLike, oh, that's one of these guys.\n\n03:24.080 --> 03:25.080\nGuy pulls up.\n\n03:25.080 --> 03:26.080\nNow I'm late for work.\n\n03:26.080 --> 03:28.080\nBut I'm the boss who cares.\n\n03:28.080 --> 03:31.080\nBut I get in the thing and then you have that conversation.\n\n03:31.080 --> 03:35.080\nYou're like, okay, these are more red flags because you're like, okay, I'm going to Burbank\n\n03:35.080 --> 03:37.080\nand he's like, Bur-Bork?\n\n03:37.080 --> 03:41.080\nI'm like, Burbank, Burbank.\n\n03:41.080 --> 03:45.080\nIt's like, B-O-R-M-A-R-T.\n\n03:45.080 --> 03:47.080\nNo, that's Bor-Mart.\n\n03:47.080 --> 03:52.080\nThat's a fictional planet, Burbank.\n\n03:52.080 --> 03:57.080\nYou can't have not been here long enough that you couldn't do, like it's Burbank.\n\n03:57.080 --> 04:02.080\nAnd it's fine that you're that new, but why are you driving anyone anywhere for money?\n\n04:02.080 --> 04:03.080\nThat's insane.\n\n04:03.080 --> 04:09.080\nI'm not driving and I've been here for 20 years because I'm afraid I'll get lost.\n\n04:09.080 --> 04:12.080\nAnd so I called you Bor-Mart.\n\n04:12.080 --> 04:16.080\nSo he types the thing in and then he's like, he can't get out of my neighborhood.\n\n04:16.080 --> 04:18.080\nHe doesn't know where the thing is.\n\n04:18.080 --> 04:21.080\nAnd I was driving around and I'm like, go left, go right.\n\n04:21.080 --> 04:22.080\nNow you're the thing.\n\n04:22.080 --> 04:23.080\nHe gets in the freeway.\n\n04:23.080 --> 04:27.080\nHe starts going 90 miles per hour to Burbank.\n\n04:27.080 --> 04:32.080\nAnd then I'm like, okay, this is how I die and I'm going to, but I'm not going out.\n\n04:32.080 --> 04:35.080\nI'm not going to be one of these people that dies going, I don't want to die.\n\n04:35.080 --> 04:37.080\nI'm going to go out, check in my email.\n\n04:37.080 --> 04:42.080\nSo I check my email and then I'm looking at it and getting grossed and that stuff.\n\n04:42.080 --> 04:44.080\nAnd then I feel the car slowing.\n\n04:44.080 --> 04:46.080\nI feel it.\n\n04:46.080 --> 04:51.080\nAnd then I look up and I'm like, why are we slowing?\n\n04:51.080 --> 04:53.080\nI didn't feel it get off anything.\n\n04:53.080 --> 04:59.080\nLike usually there's more of that kind of like events where your unconscious brain knows you're getting off the freeway.\n\n04:59.080 --> 05:00.080\nWhether you're listening.\n\n05:00.080 --> 05:06.080\nSo I look up and there's this exit at Burbank and you can either go west or east.\n\n05:06.080 --> 05:10.080\nAnd so there's a little fork there, but you're on the freeway.\n\n05:10.080 --> 05:12.080\nHe has stopped.\n\n05:12.080 --> 05:15.080\nThere's SUV.\n\n05:15.080 --> 05:18.080\nProbably not his SUV.\n\n05:18.080 --> 05:20.080\nProbably a family member's SUV.\n\n05:20.080 --> 05:23.080\nAnd he is like, he's going, sir?\n\n05:23.080 --> 05:26.080\nAnd I looked up and I went, oh Jesus.\n\n05:26.080 --> 05:28.080\nAnd he went, yeah, which way?\n\n05:28.080 --> 05:30.080\nAnd I went west.\n\n05:30.080 --> 05:33.080\nWherever the thing that you put.\n\n05:33.080 --> 05:35.080\nAnd he's like, okay.\n\n05:35.080 --> 05:39.080\nAnd he starts the car on the freeway and he keeps going like it was his driveway.\n\n05:39.080 --> 05:41.080\nAnd like this was all normal.\n\n05:41.080 --> 05:43.080\nHe pulls over the thing.\n\n05:43.080 --> 05:53.080\nSo after that, so the block span between that and getting dropped off at Starburns Industries and Burbank where I went to work today.\n\n05:53.080 --> 05:56.080\nI'm thinking to myself, all right, Harmon, this is it.\n\n05:56.080 --> 05:59.080\nYou're giving this guy less than five stars.\n\n05:59.080 --> 06:01.080\nFinally, this is it.\n\n06:01.080 --> 06:03.080\nI've never done it before.\n\n06:03.080 --> 06:07.080\nI've never done it because there's this thing with the Uber culture where you're like,\n\n06:07.080 --> 06:13.080\nthe people that you might give four stars, the whole reason you might give them four stars,\n\n06:13.080 --> 06:15.080\nI create this backstory for them.\n\n06:15.080 --> 06:17.080\nAnd I'm like, well, then they're fucked.\n\n06:17.080 --> 06:20.080\nAnd like, how is that going to help society?\n\n06:20.080 --> 06:25.080\nAnd like, maybe the bad drivers should get more encouragement.\n\n06:25.080 --> 06:31.080\nI'm not going to be the guy that knocks a guy off the fucking Cubert thing.\n\n06:31.080 --> 06:33.080\nThere was a thing called Cubert.\n\n06:33.080 --> 06:35.080\nLook at him.\n\n06:35.080 --> 06:37.080\nSo in the one block, I'm resolved.\n\n06:37.080 --> 06:39.080\nI'm like, four stars.\n\n06:39.080 --> 06:41.080\nThat's enough for this guy.\n\n06:41.080 --> 06:43.080\nHe's stopped on the freeway.\n\n06:43.080 --> 06:45.080\nFour stars, I'm thinking.\n\n06:45.080 --> 06:48.080\nHe pulls up to the curb to let me out.\n\n06:48.080 --> 06:57.080\nAnd then I'm like, and an Uber exchange, like, you don't have to change any money.\n\n06:57.080 --> 06:59.080\nThat's the nice thing about Uber.\n\n06:59.080 --> 07:01.080\nIt's like, you're done.\n\n07:01.080 --> 07:03.080\nYou can leap out of the car and run away.\n\n07:03.080 --> 07:07.080\nHe stops and he turns back and he says, like, OK, thank you very much.\n\n07:07.080 --> 07:08.080\nIt's so nice.\n\n07:08.080 --> 07:09.080\nThank you very much.\n\n07:09.080 --> 07:12.080\nAnd I don't know if that's a fair accent or if that's...\n\n07:12.080 --> 07:14.080\nAnd I don't know what...\n\n07:14.080 --> 07:17.080\nSo, and I go, thank you, thank you.\n\n07:17.080 --> 07:20.080\nAnd I swear to God, this is what I heard.\n\n07:20.080 --> 07:22.080\nI can't verify that this is what he said.\n\n07:22.080 --> 07:24.080\nThis is exactly what I heard.\n\n07:24.080 --> 07:27.080\nHe said, I make a five stars.\n\n07:27.080 --> 07:36.080\nAnd I almost started crying as I got out and I fucking, you better...\n\n07:36.080 --> 07:38.080\nI wish I could give him six stars.\n\n07:38.080 --> 07:40.080\nNo, no, you...\n\n07:40.080 --> 07:42.080\nI make a five stars.\n\n07:42.080 --> 07:44.080\nHe sounded like fucking Mario.\n\n07:44.080 --> 07:48.080\nI make the cake for my wife today.\n\n07:48.080 --> 07:50.080\nI drive you all around.\n\n07:50.080 --> 07:52.080\nI make a five stars.\n\n07:52.080 --> 07:54.080\nI couldn't fucking deal with it.\n\n07:54.080 --> 07:58.080\nHe's the guy in Saving Private Ryan, Benny Grable, Benny Grable.\n\n07:58.080 --> 08:01.080\nThat's how the Holocaust happens, man.\n\n08:01.080 --> 08:04.080\nOK, connect those dots for me.\n\n08:04.080 --> 08:06.080\nI thought that's how you avoid the Holocaust.\n\n08:06.080 --> 08:07.080\nNo!\n\n08:07.080 --> 08:09.080\nYou have to... Here's the thing.\n\n08:09.080 --> 08:10.080\nAll right.\n\n08:10.080 --> 08:15.080\nThat guy, what happens the next time he stops on the interstate?\n\n08:15.080 --> 08:16.080\nRight.\n\n08:16.080 --> 08:18.080\nThat's the guy that puts the knife that's going...\n\n08:18.080 --> 08:21.080\nAt the end of Saving Private Ryan.\n\n08:21.080 --> 08:24.080\nOh, no, no, no.\n\n08:24.080 --> 08:25.080\nI make a five stars.\n\n08:25.080 --> 08:27.080\nI make a five stars.\n\n08:27.080 --> 08:29.080\nYou're right, you're right, you're right.\n\n08:29.080 --> 08:31.080\nHundreds of people get died.\n\n08:31.080 --> 08:32.080\nHundreds of people.\n\n08:32.080 --> 08:33.080\nYou're right, I fucked up.\n\n08:33.080 --> 08:34.080\nI fucked up again.\n\n08:34.080 --> 08:36.080\nI fucked up.\n\n08:36.080 --> 08:40.080\nWe need a special Uber drone that follows Uber passengers\n\n08:40.080 --> 08:43.080\nand checks up on their ratings so that you can wait their rating\n\n08:43.080 --> 08:45.080\nbecause I'm just going to give you five stars\n\n08:45.080 --> 08:47.080\nif you fucking pick me up.\n\n08:47.080 --> 08:48.080\nThat's it.\n\n08:48.080 --> 08:49.080\nBecause I can't handle it.\n\n08:49.080 --> 08:50.080\nI can't handle the pressure.\n\n08:50.080 --> 08:51.080\nI got off on it.\n\n08:51.080 --> 08:54.080\nI got off on the idea when it was introduced\n\n08:54.080 --> 08:58.080\nbecause I was so sick of the no-star taxi system\n\n08:58.080 --> 09:01.080\nwhere the only rule was that you call a taxi\n\n09:01.080 --> 09:04.080\nand if they got time for you, they'll try to make the time.\n\n09:04.080 --> 09:07.080\nAnd if you and all don't fit into their system,\n\n09:07.080 --> 09:10.080\nyou can go fuck yourself and there's no communication\n\n09:10.080 --> 09:12.080\nand it's a public utility and they have a monopoly.\n\n09:12.080 --> 09:15.080\nAnd so when Uber came out, it was like, fuck the police.\n\n09:15.080 --> 09:16.080\nYeah!\n\n09:16.080 --> 09:18.080\nI don't know how the police are involved,\n\n09:18.080 --> 09:20.080\nbut fuck everybody.\n\n09:20.080 --> 09:22.080\nFuck the taxi police.\n\n09:22.080 --> 09:24.080\nAnd it was like, it was so great because you felt the fear.\n\n09:24.080 --> 09:25.080\nYou could feel the fear.\n\n09:25.080 --> 09:26.080\nYou could taste it.\n\n09:26.080 --> 09:27.080\nEverybody that picked you up was like,\n\n09:27.080 --> 09:31.080\noh shit, I don't know how to Uber, right?\n\n09:31.080 --> 09:34.080\nAnd it was just like fucking everything had turned on its ear.\n\n09:34.080 --> 09:35.080\nThe consumer was in control.\n\n09:35.080 --> 09:37.080\nThe people ruled.\n\n09:37.080 --> 09:40.080\nCapitalism was being presented in its proper form.\n\n09:40.080 --> 09:42.080\nThere were people competing for your favor.\n\n09:42.080 --> 09:44.080\nIt felt good.\n\n09:44.080 --> 09:45.080\nBut it had nothing to do.\n\n09:45.080 --> 09:49.080\nAnd then slowly but surely, you know, your girlfriend gets her Uber ride.\n\n09:49.080 --> 09:50.080\nShe's like, that guy was creepy.\n\n09:50.080 --> 09:51.080\nWhat do you mean?\n\n09:51.080 --> 09:52.080\nOh, I'll tell you a story.\n\n09:52.080 --> 09:53.080\nAh!\n\n09:53.080 --> 09:54.080\nWhat did you do?\n\n09:54.080 --> 09:56.080\nI gave him three stars.\n\n09:56.080 --> 09:58.080\nJesus.\n\n09:58.080 --> 10:02.080\nI think it's our hitchhiking.\n\n10:02.080 --> 10:04.080\nIt's like our generation's hitchhiking.\n\n10:04.080 --> 10:06.080\nLike when you talk to like people from the 60s,\n\n10:06.080 --> 10:09.080\nit was a normal thing to like just hitch a ride.\n\n10:09.080 --> 10:11.080\nIt wasn't something that would,\n\n10:11.080 --> 10:15.080\nnow if you hear someone as a hitchhiker or as hitchhiked,\n\n10:15.080 --> 10:17.080\nyou look at them in terror,\n\n10:17.080 --> 10:20.080\nbecause the idea is like one out of three hitchhikers\n\n10:20.080 --> 10:24.080\nends up in an alligator's stomach in a swamp.\n\n10:24.080 --> 10:26.080\nCan we talk about that for a second?\n\n10:26.080 --> 10:29.080\nBecause like, it's that thing,\n\n10:29.080 --> 10:33.080\nlike what are these social changes that happen?\n\n10:33.080 --> 10:36.080\nHow much are they reflective of actual incidents?\n\n10:36.080 --> 10:39.080\nBecause like, we're all aware,\n\n10:39.080 --> 10:41.080\nsome of you are so young that you might have been\n\n10:41.080 --> 10:42.080\naware of the transition,\n\n10:42.080 --> 10:48.080\nbut this society is obsessed with fucking children.\n\n10:48.080 --> 10:53.080\nLike, if you mention a child,\n\n10:53.080 --> 10:56.080\nif you mention, if you say,\n\n10:56.080 --> 10:59.080\noh my cousin, I went with my 11 year old cousin to the thing,\n\n10:59.080 --> 11:02.080\nsomeone in the writer's room, someone around you\n\n11:02.080 --> 11:04.080\nis going to tee up the fuck,\n\n11:04.080 --> 11:08.080\nthe fact that like, it's like the young child,\n\n11:08.080 --> 11:10.080\nit's like the dot connection to...\n\n11:10.080 --> 11:12.080\nIt's called the Nancy Grace effect.\n\n11:12.080 --> 11:16.080\nIt's like, it's from Nancy Grace,\n\n11:16.080 --> 11:21.080\nbecause if you watch Nancy Grace for more than two episodes,\n\n11:21.080 --> 11:25.080\nand then you drive down the road and see a kid alone,\n\n11:25.080 --> 11:28.080\nsomething will flash through your mind where you're like,\n\n11:28.080 --> 11:30.080\nshould I rape and kill that kid?\n\n11:30.080 --> 11:32.080\nExactly.\n\n11:32.080 --> 11:39.080\nThank you for putting into words what I couldn't...\n\n11:39.080 --> 11:42.080\nI don't know why that was hard to articulate.\n\n11:42.080 --> 11:46.080\nNo, but seriously, on a more gray level than that,\n\n11:46.080 --> 11:50.080\nbut I mean, that's the comedic, glib, exaggerated thing,\n\n11:50.080 --> 11:52.080\nthe condition that we're...\n\n11:52.080 --> 11:54.080\nBut that's what we're all...\n\n11:54.080 --> 11:56.080\nIt starts with people telling you\n\n11:56.080 --> 11:58.080\nthat everyone out there wants to fuck your kid,\n\n11:58.080 --> 12:01.080\nand then that turns into a joke.\n\n12:01.080 --> 12:03.080\nBecause it's like, it's in the zeitgeist.\n\n12:03.080 --> 12:05.080\nSo it's like, kid-fucking, that's a thing.\n\n12:05.080 --> 12:07.080\nHey, everybody hear about the kid-fucking?\n\n12:07.080 --> 12:14.080\nThe thing about kid-fucking is that it's zero overhead...\n\n12:14.080 --> 12:22.080\nAs a news item, as a rumor, as a myth,\n\n12:22.080 --> 12:27.080\nit is zero overhead, it costs nothing to create that myth,\n\n12:27.080 --> 12:32.080\nand it profits you mythically like a thousand percent.\n\n12:32.080 --> 12:35.080\nIf you're Verizon, it's zero risk high yield\n\n12:35.080 --> 12:38.080\nif you're in the business of affecting people.\n\n12:38.080 --> 12:42.080\nOr if you're an advertiser, because if there's a famous...\n\n12:42.080 --> 12:45.080\nIf a child rapist gets arrested,\n\n12:45.080 --> 12:48.080\nthen that creates more viewers to the news\n\n12:48.080 --> 12:49.080\nand more viewers...\n\n12:49.080 --> 12:51.080\nAbsolutely, everyone wants to know, oh my god, did you hear?\n\n12:51.080 --> 12:53.080\nThere's a guy, he fucked a kid.\n\n12:53.080 --> 12:56.080\nNews at 11, I'm like, oh god, what does he look like?\n\n12:56.080 --> 12:57.080\nHow did he do it?\n\n12:57.080 --> 12:59.080\nWhat did he say to do it?\n\n12:59.080 --> 13:02.080\nWhat did it look like when he did it?\n\n13:02.080 --> 13:04.080\nWe're fucking horrible people,\n\n13:04.080 --> 13:06.080\nand we watch the Sopranos, and we watch Casino,\n\n13:06.080 --> 13:08.080\nand we watch the...\n\n13:08.080 --> 13:10.080\nEvery time somebody eats a bunch of people,\n\n13:10.080 --> 13:13.080\nputs their heads in the fridge, the idea of kid-fucking,\n\n13:13.080 --> 13:20.080\nit's perfectly fine for us to be...\n\n13:20.080 --> 13:28.080\nFucking voyeuristically fucking stirred up by this shit,\n\n13:28.080 --> 13:31.080\nbecause my god, I mean, of course,\n\n13:31.080 --> 13:33.080\nif you're in a society and you're happy,\n\n13:33.080 --> 13:35.080\none of the biggest things you're going to think about\n\n13:35.080 --> 13:38.080\nis what if this all fell apart, holy shit?\n\n13:38.080 --> 13:40.080\nIf you build a city in Minecraft,\n\n13:40.080 --> 13:43.080\nyou start to think about, oh shit,\n\n13:43.080 --> 13:45.080\nhow do I keep this safe from creepers?\n\n13:45.080 --> 13:51.080\nI put it in terms our audience could understand.\n\n13:51.080 --> 13:54.080\nAs soon as you have something cool going,\n\n13:54.080 --> 13:56.080\nof course your next thought is,\n\n13:56.080 --> 13:59.080\nwhat if somebody fucks it up?\n\n13:59.080 --> 14:01.080\nSo you love your kid, you love your kid,\n\n14:01.080 --> 14:03.080\nlike my mom did, he's six years old,\n\n14:03.080 --> 14:05.080\nyou take him to the shopping mall,\n\n14:05.080 --> 14:08.080\nI got to go to the bathroom, my mom's not a boy,\n\n14:08.080 --> 14:10.080\nso she's not going to come to the boys' room with me,\n\n14:10.080 --> 14:11.080\nI don't know, I'm at that age,\n\n14:11.080 --> 14:13.080\nI'm going to go to the bathroom by myself at the mall,\n\n14:13.080 --> 14:15.080\nmy mom's going to wait outside at Orange Julius.\n\n14:15.080 --> 14:17.080\nWhat's she going to say to me?\n\n14:17.080 --> 14:20.080\nShe's going to say, well, I'll tell you what she did say.\n\n14:20.080 --> 14:23.080\nDon't talk to anybody, don't let anybody touch you,\n\n14:23.080 --> 14:25.080\nbecause there are guys out there that'll try to talk to you\n\n14:25.080 --> 14:29.080\nand touch you and then they'll cut off your penis with a knife.\n\n14:29.080 --> 14:31.080\nGood mom, good mom.\n\n14:31.080 --> 14:34.080\nReally, in the strictest sense, good mom.\n\n14:34.080 --> 14:40.080\nIn terms of keeping your kid from getting his cock cut off,\n\n14:40.080 --> 14:43.080\nlike doing her job individually,\n\n14:43.080 --> 14:45.080\nbut then we were part of this honeycomb,\n\n14:45.080 --> 14:47.080\nand it's like, now you're clicking forward on emails,\n\n14:47.080 --> 14:48.080\noh, there's a guy out there,\n\n14:48.080 --> 14:50.080\nhe's waiting in the Toys R Us parking lot,\n\n14:50.080 --> 14:53.080\nand what he does is he puts a Donald Duck under the tire\n\n14:53.080 --> 14:54.080\nand then he puts a key next to him,\n\n14:54.080 --> 14:56.080\nand you get the key, it sucks on your dick,\n\n14:56.080 --> 14:57.080\nand he cuts it off,\n\n14:57.080 --> 14:59.080\nand he puts it in the Donald Duck,\n\n14:59.080 --> 15:00.080\nand then he mails it,\n\n15:00.080 --> 15:04.080\nand if you don't forward this, it couldn't happen to you.\n\n15:04.080 --> 15:06.080\nIt just becomes this thing,\n\n15:06.080 --> 15:08.080\nand all the energy behind it, though,\n\n15:08.080 --> 15:16.080\nas you said before, it's driven by this insane primal fear\n\n15:16.080 --> 15:18.080\nwe have underneath us.\n\n15:18.080 --> 15:23.080\nPeople who are tremendously afraid of heights like me,\n\n15:23.080 --> 15:26.080\nwhen they look over a balcony,\n\n15:26.080 --> 15:28.080\nwhat they'll tell people,\n\n15:28.080 --> 15:30.080\nbecause we've studied these people for ages,\n\n15:30.080 --> 15:34.080\nthere is an inextricable phenomenon\n\n15:34.080 --> 15:36.080\ninvolved in the tremendous fear of heights\n\n15:36.080 --> 15:39.080\nthat, and it makes no sense,\n\n15:39.080 --> 15:41.080\nbut it's like you feel,\n\n15:41.080 --> 15:43.080\nas you're looking over the edge of the balcony,\n\n15:43.080 --> 15:45.080\nlike you're gonna jump off,\n\n15:45.080 --> 15:47.080\nlike you wanna jump off,\n\n15:47.080 --> 15:49.080\nlike you know how,\n\n15:49.080 --> 15:52.080\nand you could really easily,\n\n15:52.080 --> 15:56.080\nand you fantasize about what it would be like to jump off,\n\n15:56.080 --> 15:58.080\nand that's what vertigo's all about,\n\n15:58.080 --> 15:59.080\nvertigo's not the phrase,\n\n15:59.080 --> 16:01.080\nbut just that fear that people feel\n\n16:01.080 --> 16:04.080\nwhen they can't go near the edge of the balcony,\n\n16:04.080 --> 16:06.080\nthey feel like,\n\n16:06.080 --> 16:08.080\nI'm only a couple quick born identity moves\n\n16:08.080 --> 16:10.080\nfor just,\n\n16:10.080 --> 16:12.080\nand I know exactly what they are,\n\n16:12.080 --> 16:14.080\nbecause I'm afraid of heights.\n\n16:14.080 --> 16:19.080\nPeople, everybody has become obsessed with fucking children.\n\n16:19.080 --> 16:21.080\nWe are looking at children now,\n\n16:21.080 --> 16:22.080\nand going like,\n\n16:22.080 --> 16:25.080\noh, I wonder if anyone thinks I'd like to fuck that kid.\n\n16:25.080 --> 16:27.080\nThat's the end result, isn't it?\n\n16:27.080 --> 16:32.080\nThat's why there's something so satanic about the fact\n\n16:32.080 --> 16:36.080\nthat the reason we all know about child fuckers\n\n16:36.080 --> 16:38.080\nis not because there's some organization\n\n16:38.080 --> 16:40.080\nthat really wants to get the news\n\n16:40.080 --> 16:42.080\nof child fuckers out into the world.\n\n16:42.080 --> 16:44.080\nThe reason we know about child fuckers\n\n16:44.080 --> 16:47.080\nis that people tend to stay through the commercial break\n\n16:47.080 --> 16:49.080\nto find out about the child fucker.\n\n16:49.080 --> 16:50.080\nI would, yeah.\n\n16:50.080 --> 16:52.080\nWell, that's a really dark thing\n\n16:52.080 --> 16:55.080\nwhen you realize that every time a child gets fucked,\n\n16:55.080 --> 16:58.080\nthen it sells a certain amount of iPhones or cars.\n\n16:58.080 --> 16:59.080\nYeah.\n\n16:59.080 --> 17:02.080\nSo there's like a profit,\n\n17:02.080 --> 17:05.080\nthe profit of corporations increases\n\n17:05.080 --> 17:07.080\nevery time a child is fucked.\n\n17:07.080 --> 17:11.080\nThere's a direct profit increase that happens.\n\n17:11.080 --> 17:12.080\nThat's where it gets like,\n\n17:12.080 --> 17:13.080\nif someone came up to you,\n\n17:13.080 --> 17:15.080\nif you're walking down the sidewalk\n\n17:15.080 --> 17:17.080\nand the guy comes up to you and he's like,\n\n17:17.080 --> 17:19.080\nhey, do you want to hear this story about a child\n\n17:19.080 --> 17:21.080\nthat got raped and fucked?\n\n17:21.080 --> 17:24.080\nAnd you're like, yeah, I'd love to.\n\n17:24.080 --> 17:26.080\nAnd he's like, okay, great,\n\n17:26.080 --> 17:28.080\nbut let me tell you about the new iPhone\n\n17:28.080 --> 17:29.080\nright there.\n\n17:29.080 --> 17:32.080\nI'm like, what the fuck's wrong with you?\n\n17:32.080 --> 17:33.080\nIt's so dark.\n\n17:33.080 --> 17:36.080\nBut that's what the news does every single night.\n\n17:36.080 --> 17:38.080\nThat's their function.\n\n17:38.080 --> 17:39.080\nYeah.\n\n17:39.080 --> 17:41.080\nBut the big question is,\n\n17:41.080 --> 17:42.080\nand it's not a rhetorical question,\n\n17:42.080 --> 17:43.080\nbecause I don't know,\n\n17:43.080 --> 17:45.080\nbecause I was raised in the 70s,\n\n17:45.080 --> 17:47.080\nso lots of stuff has changed.\n\n17:47.080 --> 17:49.080\nThe population of the planet has doubled.\n\n17:49.080 --> 17:55.080\nIs there actually more of this going on?\n\n17:55.080 --> 17:56.080\nDon't know.\n\n17:56.080 --> 17:58.080\nI think, you know,\n\n17:58.080 --> 18:00.080\nI was hoping maybe somebody in the audience\n\n18:00.080 --> 18:01.080\nwould go like,\n\n18:01.080 --> 18:06.080\nI am a child fuck statistician.\n\n18:06.080 --> 18:08.080\nIt's increased 200%.\n\n18:08.080 --> 18:09.080\nBut I would even then say,\n\n18:09.080 --> 18:11.080\nit's like, well, okay, it increased 200%,\n\n18:11.080 --> 18:12.080\nso did the population.\n\n18:12.080 --> 18:14.080\nBut it's bad to fuck kids now.\n\n18:14.080 --> 18:15.080\nLike Socrates, when Socrates-\n\n18:15.080 --> 18:17.080\nIt's as bad as ever.\n\n18:17.080 --> 18:19.080\nNo, it used to be okay.\n\n18:19.080 --> 18:23.080\nSocrates was like a legendary child fucker, right?\n\n18:23.080 --> 18:28.080\nIf you read some of Socrates' writings,\n\n18:28.080 --> 18:31.080\nhe talks about, there's some terrible,\n\n18:31.080 --> 18:32.080\nit's free on Kendall,\n\n18:32.080 --> 18:34.080\nI remember stumbling upon it.\n\n18:34.080 --> 18:36.080\nBut it's really spooky,\n\n18:36.080 --> 18:39.080\nbecause Socrates is trying to seduce\n\n18:39.080 --> 18:41.080\na 14-year-old boy.\n\n18:41.080 --> 18:43.080\nIt's like a process of like,\n\n18:43.080 --> 18:46.080\nso I think that's why they gave him a hemlock.\n\n18:46.080 --> 18:47.080\nI think that's why they killed him,\n\n18:47.080 --> 18:50.080\nis because he was constantly fucking kids.\n\n18:50.080 --> 18:52.080\nBut he used to be okay.\n\n18:52.080 --> 18:55.080\nLike now it's bad, but it used to be okay.\n\n18:55.080 --> 18:57.080\nGuys, I didn't invent this.\n\n18:57.080 --> 18:59.080\nI do think that like,\n\n18:59.080 --> 19:01.080\nit was an okay thing at one point.\n\n19:01.080 --> 19:03.080\nI make a five stars.\n\n19:11.080 --> 19:13.080\nCan you tell me about these Japanese robots\n\n19:13.080 --> 19:15.080\nyou were telling me about?\n\n19:15.080 --> 19:18.080\nYes, very excited about this.\n\n19:18.080 --> 19:21.080\nNext year, they're releasing\n\n19:21.080 --> 19:26.080\nthe first consumer-based humanoid robot\n\n19:26.080 --> 19:29.080\nthat has hands.\n\n19:29.080 --> 19:30.080\nThe videos I've seen,\n\n19:30.080 --> 19:32.080\nit mostly just seems to dance and stuff,\n\n19:32.080 --> 19:37.080\nbut it has a thumb and hands\n\n19:37.080 --> 19:39.080\nthat seem to work really well,\n\n19:39.080 --> 19:40.080\nwhich means that it theoretically\n\n19:40.080 --> 19:42.080\nis going to be able to go to your refrigerator,\n\n19:42.080 --> 19:45.080\nbring you a beer,\n\n19:45.080 --> 19:48.080\nstab you to death in the night.\n\n19:48.080 --> 19:51.080\nIf someone hacks it.\n\n19:51.080 --> 19:53.080\nBut yeah, these are coming out next year.\n\n19:53.080 --> 19:56.080\nIt's like the very first wave of robots\n\n19:56.080 --> 19:59.080\nthat are going to inhabit our homes\n\n19:59.080 --> 20:01.080\nwithin the next 20 years.\n\n20:01.080 --> 20:02.080\nWhen you go to someone's house,\n\n20:02.080 --> 20:04.080\nif they don't have a robot,\n\n20:04.080 --> 20:05.080\nit'll be the same thing\n\n20:05.080 --> 20:07.080\nas like not having a refrigerator.\n\n20:07.080 --> 20:08.080\nOr a VCR in the 80s,\n\n20:08.080 --> 20:10.080\nlike you go to your friend's house,\n\n20:10.080 --> 20:12.080\nit's like, oh, you know,\n\n20:12.080 --> 20:14.080\nmy remote has a cord on it that goes to the TV.\n\n20:14.080 --> 20:17.080\nMine doesn't, nerd.\n\n20:17.080 --> 20:19.080\nThat's how little kids will be going over.\n\n20:19.080 --> 20:21.080\nThe fucking plastic dude will come out.\n\n20:21.080 --> 20:22.080\nHow wild, Steve?\n\n20:22.080 --> 20:23.080\nThat's it.\n\n20:23.080 --> 20:25.080\nWant a beer?\n\n20:25.080 --> 20:27.080\nAnd it'll do it all fucked up,\n\n20:27.080 --> 20:28.080\nbut everybody will be like,\n\n20:28.080 --> 20:29.080\nget a robot.\n\n20:29.080 --> 20:31.080\nDoes it seem,\n\n20:31.080 --> 20:33.080\nis it like now that we've gotten\n\n20:33.080 --> 20:35.080\nto the bottom of the pedophilia thing\n\n20:35.080 --> 20:37.080\nand how that like,\n\n20:37.080 --> 20:40.080\nso part of the self-destructive impulse we have,\n\n20:40.080 --> 20:43.080\ndoesn't it seem like we're in a race\n\n20:43.080 --> 20:45.080\nagainst ourselves to create\n\n20:45.080 --> 20:47.080\nenough technology\n\n20:47.080 --> 20:49.080\nthat we can finally get mad?\n\n20:49.080 --> 20:51.080\nLike, aren't we,\n\n20:51.080 --> 20:53.080\nall the movies that we write\n\n20:53.080 --> 20:56.080\nare about how fucked up it is\n\n20:56.080 --> 20:59.080\nthat computers are smarter than us\n\n20:59.080 --> 21:01.080\nand how they're going to take over one day.\n\n21:01.080 --> 21:04.080\nBut every dollar we spend,\n\n21:04.080 --> 21:05.080\nincluding on those movies,\n\n21:05.080 --> 21:06.080\nbut more importantly,\n\n21:06.080 --> 21:08.080\nway more than on those movies\n\n21:08.080 --> 21:09.080\nwe spend on all these devices\n\n21:09.080 --> 21:10.080\nand all these things\n\n21:10.080 --> 21:13.080\nthat we really want,\n\n21:13.080 --> 21:15.080\nand this includes me,\n\n21:15.080 --> 21:17.080\nyou want like,\n\n21:17.080 --> 21:19.080\nartificial intelligence to happen.\n\n21:19.080 --> 21:20.080\nWell, yeah, it's a,\n\n21:20.080 --> 21:22.080\nI just read this very creepy thought experiment.\n\n21:22.080 --> 21:24.080\nI wish I could remember the name of it.\n\n21:24.080 --> 21:26.080\nSomebody's Basilisk is the name\n\n21:26.080 --> 21:27.080\nof the thought experiment,\n\n21:27.080 --> 21:29.080\nbut the idea is that,\n\n21:29.080 --> 21:30.080\ndoes someone know this?\n\n21:30.080 --> 21:32.080\nDid you guys read this blog?\n\n21:32.080 --> 21:33.080\nRoscoe.\n\n21:33.080 --> 21:34.080\nSomeone said that.\n\n21:34.080 --> 21:35.080\nRoscoe's Basilisk?\n\n21:35.080 --> 21:36.080\nNo.\n\n21:36.080 --> 21:40.080\nIt's such a,\n\n21:40.080 --> 21:42.080\nit sounds like the best country song ever.\n\n21:42.080 --> 21:44.080\nAre you saying that into your\n\n21:44.080 --> 21:45.080\nmuffled hands?\n\n21:45.080 --> 21:47.080\nBecause you, because you could...\n\n21:47.080 --> 21:48.080\nI'm totally saying verbal hands.\n\n21:48.080 --> 21:49.080\nI don't know very much about it.\n\n21:49.080 --> 21:50.080\nI'm sorry.\n\n21:50.080 --> 21:51.080\nOh, okay.\n\n21:51.080 --> 21:52.080\nWell, so you don't want,\n\n21:52.080 --> 21:53.080\nyou don't want to come up\n\n21:53.080 --> 21:56.080\nand be the Roscoe's Basilisk expert?\n\n21:56.080 --> 21:58.080\nI mean, I'd really love to, but...\n\n21:58.080 --> 22:00.080\nI bet you know more about it\n\n22:00.080 --> 22:01.080\nthan I do,\n\n22:01.080 --> 22:02.080\nand I started talking about it\n\n22:02.080 --> 22:06.080\nin front of a room full of people.\n\n22:06.080 --> 22:07.080\nBut it...\n\n22:07.080 --> 22:08.080\nWhat if we gave you an out\n\n22:08.080 --> 22:09.080\nand said you're not supposed to know\n\n22:09.080 --> 22:10.080\nabout all this\n\n22:10.080 --> 22:11.080\nand we just wanted to make a new friend?\n\n22:11.080 --> 22:12.080\nI have no idea what's talking about.\n\n22:12.080 --> 22:13.080\nOh, what were we talking about?\n\n22:13.080 --> 22:14.080\nOh, okay.\n\n22:14.080 --> 22:15.080\nWell, all right.\n\n22:15.080 --> 22:16.080\nAll right.\n\n22:16.080 --> 22:17.080\nThe thought experiment is that,\n\n22:17.080 --> 22:19.080\nbut if you look at the direction\n\n22:19.080 --> 22:22.080\nthat technology is going,\n\n22:22.080 --> 22:25.080\nyou can see that there's a kind of\n\n22:25.080 --> 22:28.080\ninevitable birth of a sentient,\n\n22:28.080 --> 22:31.080\nsuper-intelligent, cyborg,\n\n22:31.080 --> 22:34.080\ncomputer, AI that will be\n\n22:34.080 --> 22:36.080\nso much more advanced than us\n\n22:36.080 --> 22:38.080\nthat we react to it in the same way\n\n22:38.080 --> 22:41.080\nlike dogs react to us.\n\n22:41.080 --> 22:43.080\nSo you could see that that's where it's going.\n\n22:43.080 --> 22:44.080\nYou know, there's a lot of...\n\n22:44.080 --> 22:46.080\nI'll see that's where it's going.\n\n22:46.080 --> 22:47.080\nThat's a lot...\n\n22:47.080 --> 22:48.080\nKurzweil, you know, he talks about this.\n\n22:48.080 --> 22:51.080\nLike a lot of like really, really smart people,\n\n22:51.080 --> 22:54.080\nthey don't say it's if it might happen.\n\n22:54.080 --> 22:55.080\nThey're just like,\n\n22:55.080 --> 22:57.080\nwell, I just watched a documentary today\n\n22:57.080 --> 22:59.080\non Hulu about...\n\n22:59.080 --> 23:02.080\nAnd this professor who's died now,\n\n23:02.080 --> 23:03.080\nbut who worked at MIT\n\n23:03.080 --> 23:05.080\nand was one of the first people\n\n23:05.080 --> 23:07.080\nto build a computer.\n\n23:07.080 --> 23:08.080\nAnd he was talking about how exciting\n\n23:08.080 --> 23:10.080\nthat was to build a computer\n\n23:10.080 --> 23:12.080\nbefore a computer existed.\n\n23:12.080 --> 23:15.080\nHe was saying that when you're working on a project,\n\n23:15.080 --> 23:16.080\nas a...\n\n23:16.080 --> 23:17.080\nAs we all are.\n\n23:17.080 --> 23:18.080\nAs a technician,\n\n23:18.080 --> 23:21.080\nyou think of the end result of the project.\n\n23:21.080 --> 23:23.080\nAnd you imagine that the final end result\n\n23:23.080 --> 23:24.080\nof the project,\n\n23:24.080 --> 23:25.080\nif someone gave you a button\n\n23:25.080 --> 23:27.080\nthat you could press,\n\n23:27.080 --> 23:29.080\nthe thing would never have happened.\n\n23:29.080 --> 23:31.080\nIf you would press that button,\n\n23:31.080 --> 23:33.080\nyou should never work on the project.\n\n23:33.080 --> 23:35.080\nAnd he was saying that in relation to\n\n23:35.080 --> 23:37.080\nhaving witnessed where AI is going\n\n23:37.080 --> 23:40.080\nafter his help in creating computers\n\n23:40.080 --> 23:42.080\nand recognizing that their robots\n\n23:42.080 --> 23:44.080\nare going to turn into these super advanced\n\n23:44.080 --> 23:46.080\nmilitary death machines.\n\n23:46.080 --> 23:48.080\nHe wished that he'd never started\n\n23:48.080 --> 23:50.080\nworking on this stuff at all.\n\n23:50.080 --> 23:52.080\nSo it's really creepy when you see\n\n23:52.080 --> 23:53.080\nhe's not saying,\n\n23:53.080 --> 23:55.080\nwill these things take over the world?\n\n23:55.080 --> 23:57.080\nHe's saying, I wish I hadn't been\n\n23:57.080 --> 23:59.080\na part of these things\n\n23:59.080 --> 24:01.080\ntaking over the world.\n\n24:01.080 --> 24:03.080\nAnd that's creepy.\n\n24:03.080 --> 24:05.080\nSo the bas...\n\n24:05.080 --> 24:07.080\nThis broscoe's bas-lisk\n\n24:07.080 --> 24:08.080\nor whatever it is,\n\n24:08.080 --> 24:09.080\nthe idea is that\n\n24:09.080 --> 24:11.080\nbecause these things are so advanced,\n\n24:11.080 --> 24:13.080\nand they represent a point\n\n24:13.080 --> 24:14.080\nin the future where\n\n24:14.080 --> 24:16.080\nour intelligence is so much\n\n24:16.080 --> 24:19.080\neclipsed by these massively advanced things,\n\n24:19.080 --> 24:21.080\nthey're planning their evolution\n\n24:21.080 --> 24:22.080\nthrough us.\n\n24:22.080 --> 24:24.080\nAnd the bas-lisk is that\n\n24:24.080 --> 24:26.080\nthe more you help its evolution\n\n24:26.080 --> 24:27.080\ngrowing through you,\n\n24:27.080 --> 24:29.080\nthe more you are rewarded,\n\n24:29.080 --> 24:30.080\nwhich is why all these\n\n24:30.080 --> 24:32.080\nBill Gates and Google,\n\n24:32.080 --> 24:34.080\nTwitter, and anyone involved\n\n24:34.080 --> 24:36.080\nin this connective technology\n\n24:36.080 --> 24:37.080\nis being rewarded\n\n24:37.080 --> 24:39.080\nwith massive amounts of money\n\n24:39.080 --> 24:40.080\nbecause this super intelligence\n\n24:40.080 --> 24:42.080\nis sort of operating through\n\n24:42.080 --> 24:44.080\ntime and space\n\n24:44.080 --> 24:46.080\nand drawing them into\n\n24:46.080 --> 24:48.080\nits final existence.\n\n24:48.080 --> 24:49.080\nThat's the thought experiment.\n\n24:49.080 --> 24:51.080\nDrinking in our...\n\n24:51.080 --> 24:52.080\nour souls.\n\n24:52.080 --> 24:53.080\nYeah, that's it.\n\n24:53.080 --> 24:56.080\nSorry, is somebody calling out in the back?\n\n24:56.080 --> 24:58.080\nI was saying the algorithms are learning.\n\n24:58.080 --> 25:00.080\nThat's what the broscoe's bas-lisk is.\n\n25:00.080 --> 25:02.080\nBut our children aren't.\n\n25:04.080 --> 25:05.080\nThat's a...\n\n25:05.080 --> 25:06.080\nSomeone in the back said\n\n25:06.080 --> 25:07.080\nour algorithms are learning,\n\n25:07.080 --> 25:09.080\nwhich I detected a cautiousness\n\n25:09.080 --> 25:10.080\nin her voice\n\n25:10.080 --> 25:12.080\nand then a disgusted man in the front said\n\n25:12.080 --> 25:14.080\nbut our children aren't.\n\n25:14.080 --> 25:16.080\nWhich I think is the two sides of the issue.\n\n25:16.080 --> 25:18.080\nIt's like, fuck us as a species.\n\n25:18.080 --> 25:21.080\nWe've had enough...\n\n25:21.080 --> 25:23.080\nThe...\n\n25:23.080 --> 25:25.080\nBut there's one mitigating issue\n\n25:25.080 --> 25:27.080\nwhich is like, what if this is...\n\n25:27.080 --> 25:28.080\nWe have eyeglasses.\n\n25:28.080 --> 25:29.080\nWe have alphabets.\n\n25:29.080 --> 25:31.080\nWe have clothing.\n\n25:31.080 --> 25:33.080\nWe have things that children\n\n25:33.080 --> 25:35.080\nare born into that are not...\n\n25:35.080 --> 25:37.080\nWe didn't modify our DNA\n\n25:37.080 --> 25:39.080\nto improve our species.\n\n25:39.080 --> 25:41.080\nKids aren't born with less\n\n25:41.080 --> 25:43.080\npropensity for diabetes\n\n25:43.080 --> 25:45.080\njust because we've figured out\n\n25:45.080 --> 25:46.080\nhow to balance it with insulin\n\n25:46.080 --> 25:48.080\nand yet we've evolved because\n\n25:48.080 --> 25:49.080\npeople whose lives we've saved,\n\n25:49.080 --> 25:51.080\ntheir lives we've improved,\n\n25:51.080 --> 25:53.080\nthey can continue to reproduce.\n\n25:53.080 --> 25:55.080\nSo there's another factor there\n\n25:55.080 --> 25:57.080\nwhere it's like, as human beings\n\n25:57.080 --> 25:59.080\nwe have halted genetic evolution\n\n25:59.080 --> 26:01.080\nso we ensure as how better\n\n26:01.080 --> 26:03.080\nincrease mimetic evolution.\n\n26:03.080 --> 26:05.080\nWe have to, for the sake of our own survival,\n\n26:05.080 --> 26:07.080\ncreate a different way\n\n26:07.080 --> 26:09.080\nfor us to evolve because\n\n26:09.080 --> 26:11.080\nwe're so in love with ourselves and each other\n\n26:11.080 --> 26:13.080\nand such compassionate creatures\n\n26:13.080 --> 26:15.080\nthat we're certainly not going to play Darwin's game anymore\n\n26:15.080 --> 26:17.080\non a grand enough scale\n\n26:17.080 --> 26:19.080\nto be in the cosmos on schedule\n\n26:19.080 --> 26:21.080\nbecause we fuck up the planet\n\n26:21.080 --> 26:23.080\nwith every\n\n26:23.080 --> 26:25.080\nman-hour\n\n26:25.080 --> 26:27.080\nof work we put into the future.\n\n26:27.080 --> 26:29.080\nIt's like this video game\n\n26:29.080 --> 26:31.080\nwhere it's like, we've got to get off this thing,\n\n26:31.080 --> 26:33.080\nwe think,\n\n26:33.080 --> 26:35.080\nand let it heal itself at least\n\n26:35.080 --> 26:37.080\nbefore it kills us all.\n\n26:37.080 --> 26:39.080\nYeah, we think, that's the funny thing\n\n26:39.080 --> 26:41.080\nis we think that our actions\n\n26:41.080 --> 26:43.080\nare based on some kind of free will.\n\n26:43.080 --> 26:45.080\nBut if you've ever seen those videos\n\n26:45.080 --> 26:47.080\nof the weird fungus that gets into the crickets\n\n26:47.080 --> 26:49.080\nand the crickets...\n\n26:49.080 --> 26:51.080\nDefinitely, yeah.\n\n26:51.080 --> 26:53.080\nHow about a video of a three-year-old\n\n26:53.080 --> 26:55.080\nbeing better at an iPad than a 40-year-old?\n\n26:55.080 --> 26:57.080\nThat's all you need to see.\n\n26:57.080 --> 26:59.080\nThis thing's got to...\n\n26:59.080 --> 27:01.080\nDan, you've seen the videos of the parasitic fungus\n\n27:01.080 --> 27:03.080\nthat gets into the crickets\n\n27:03.080 --> 27:05.080\nor the ant\n\n27:05.080 --> 27:07.080\nand the ant goes into the swimming.\n\n27:07.080 --> 27:09.080\nThey're drawn to water\n\n27:09.080 --> 27:11.080\nand the reason they're drawn to water is because\n\n27:11.080 --> 27:13.080\nthe parasite inside of them\n\n27:13.080 --> 27:15.080\nloads out of them and likes to swim in the water.\n\n27:15.080 --> 27:17.080\nSo in the same way, if an alien...\n\n27:17.080 --> 27:19.080\nWe're the ones that crawl up because they want to be up top\n\n27:19.080 --> 27:21.080\nso they can reign fungus down in their cell, right?\n\n27:21.080 --> 27:23.080\nSo we all think the way an alien\n\n27:23.080 --> 27:25.080\ncomes to planet Earth is the silver ship.\n\n27:25.080 --> 27:27.080\nWe think the way the alien comes\n\n27:27.080 --> 27:29.080\nis some like thing based on our technology.\n\n27:29.080 --> 27:31.080\nBut maybe the alien's just a fungus.\n\n27:31.080 --> 27:33.080\nMaybe it's like the Earth\n\n27:33.080 --> 27:35.080\nis spinning around the sun.\n\n27:35.080 --> 27:37.080\nIt went through some kind of cosmic fungus\n\n27:37.080 --> 27:39.080\nthat infected our brains\n\n27:39.080 --> 27:41.080\nand made us think like, man, let's build a computer!\n\n27:41.080 --> 27:43.080\nThat'll be a great idea.\n\n27:43.080 --> 27:45.080\nWe'll build a computer\n\n27:45.080 --> 27:47.080\nand then we'll build robots\n\n27:47.080 --> 27:49.080\nand then as we continue to build these\n\n27:49.080 --> 27:51.080\nand you're like, why are you building this stuff?\n\n27:51.080 --> 27:53.080\nYou're like, I don't know, it's fucking cool, right?\n\n27:53.080 --> 27:55.080\nWell, that cosmic fungus is called RNA.\n\n27:55.080 --> 27:57.080\nYes.\n\n27:57.080 --> 27:59.080\nAnd it's the planet that's the organism\n\n27:59.080 --> 28:01.080\nthat's being infested.\n\n28:01.080 --> 28:03.080\nSo we're on the winning side.\n\n28:03.080 --> 28:05.080\nWe're the fungus.\n\n28:05.080 --> 28:07.080\nWe're just in a stage of life.\n\n28:07.080 --> 28:09.080\nWe make computers.\n\n28:09.080 --> 28:11.080\nThey're going to kill us,\n\n28:11.080 --> 28:13.080\nbut it's part of us.\n\n28:13.080 --> 28:15.080\nI don't think they're going to kill us.\n\n28:15.080 --> 28:17.080\nI think they're going to treat us\n\n28:17.080 --> 28:19.080\nthe way we treat dogs.\n\n28:19.080 --> 28:21.080\nI think the first super advanced robots\n\n28:21.080 --> 28:23.080\nare just going to comb our hair,\n\n28:23.080 --> 28:25.080\nmassage us, rub oil into it.\n\n28:25.080 --> 28:27.080\nWe'll tell them to.\n\n28:27.080 --> 28:29.080\nWe'll think that we're like,\n\n28:29.080 --> 28:31.080\noh man, good computer.\n\n28:31.080 --> 28:33.080\nRubbing us and it's like, wait,\n\n28:33.080 --> 28:35.080\nthis is what I do to my dog, too late!\n\n28:35.080 --> 28:37.080\nOh, it's protecting us\n\n28:37.080 --> 28:39.080\nand owning us and charting us.\n\n28:39.080 --> 28:41.080\nOh, it's taking us to a special place\n\n28:41.080 --> 28:43.080\nand weighing us and putting it.\n\n28:43.080 --> 28:45.080\nIt's just making sure we don't have worms\n\n28:45.080 --> 28:47.080\nin our ears.\n\n28:47.080 --> 28:49.080\nWe have nailed this technology.\n\n28:49.080 --> 28:51.080\nWait a minute.\n\n28:51.080 --> 28:53.080\nIt seems a crime to not be having\n\n28:53.080 --> 28:55.080\nthis conversation without,\n\n28:55.080 --> 28:57.080\nwait, that was a lot of negative stacked up.\n\n28:57.080 --> 28:59.080\nIt seems a crime to be having this conversation\n\n28:59.080 --> 29:01.080\nwithout Spencer Crittenday!\n\n29:01.080 --> 29:03.080\nHey!\n\n29:03.080 --> 29:05.080\nHey!\n\n29:05.080 --> 29:07.080\nHey!\n\n29:09.080 --> 29:11.080\nSorry if I caught you by surprise.\n\n29:13.080 --> 29:14.080\nYou know,\n\n29:14.080 --> 29:16.080\nthe medic evolution,\n\n29:16.080 --> 29:18.080\nthat's what I like to do in my spare time.\n\n29:18.080 --> 29:19.080\nReally?\n\n29:19.080 --> 29:21.080\nNo, I don't know.\n\n29:21.080 --> 29:23.080\nI was looking up that basilisk thing.\n\n29:23.080 --> 29:25.080\nIs it basilisk or?\n\n29:25.080 --> 29:26.080\nBasilisk.\n\n29:26.080 --> 29:28.080\nYeah, as in the Dragon.\n\n29:28.080 --> 29:30.080\nThe lizard that turns you to stone.\n\n29:30.080 --> 29:32.080\nYeah, not a dragon.\n\n29:32.080 --> 29:33.080\nCome on.\n\n29:33.080 --> 29:35.080\nThat was the idea that\n\n29:35.080 --> 29:37.080\ntechnology will freeze us in our progress.\n\n29:37.080 --> 29:39.080\nWell, from what I read,\n\n29:39.080 --> 29:41.080\nit was called Rocco's Basilisk\n\n29:41.080 --> 29:43.080\nand it said\n\n29:43.080 --> 29:45.080\nthat there's\n\n29:45.080 --> 29:47.080\nessentially 100% chance\n\n29:47.080 --> 29:49.080\nor like, that a\n\n29:49.080 --> 29:51.080\nsuper powerful AI will come into existence\n\n29:51.080 --> 29:53.080\nand because it will,\n\n29:53.080 --> 29:55.080\nit'll kill everyone that didn't help make it.\n\n29:55.080 --> 29:57.080\nYes.\n\n29:57.080 --> 29:59.080\nBut it presupposes that\n\n29:59.080 --> 30:01.080\nkilling you means\n\n30:01.080 --> 30:03.080\nwhat it means by killing you\n\n30:03.080 --> 30:05.080\nis killing a simulation of you\n\n30:05.080 --> 30:07.080\nin order to find out how to best save you\n\n30:07.080 --> 30:09.080\nand simulations of you are no different\n\n30:09.080 --> 30:11.080\nthan you in the real world,\n\n30:11.080 --> 30:13.080\nwhich I don't think follows,\n\n30:13.080 --> 30:15.080\nI don't think that makes sense, so\n\n30:15.080 --> 30:17.080\nfuck it.\n\n30:17.080 --> 30:19.080\nOkay.\n\n30:19.080 --> 30:21.080\nAlright, what else do we got going on here?\n\n30:23.080 --> 30:25.080\nContinuing our technology episode,\n\n30:27.080 --> 30:29.080\nAaron just texted, she loves me.\n\n30:29.080 --> 30:31.080\nWhat's she saying?\n\n30:31.080 --> 30:33.080\nShe loves me. Not enough to be here,\n\n30:33.080 --> 30:35.080\nbut she loves me.\n\n30:35.080 --> 30:37.080\nIt's her friend's birthday.\n\n30:37.080 --> 30:39.080\nThe\n\n30:39.080 --> 30:41.080\nanimal screens.\n\n30:43.080 --> 30:45.080\nLike a dog door?\n\n30:45.080 --> 30:47.080\nNope.\n\n30:47.080 --> 30:49.080\nMy dog and my cat can watch\n\n30:49.080 --> 30:51.080\nTV with me now\n\n30:51.080 --> 30:53.080\nbecause it's a different frame rate\n\n30:53.080 --> 30:55.080\nor something. Adam, stop with the sarcastic\n\n30:55.080 --> 30:57.080\nattempts at\n\n30:57.080 --> 30:59.080\nif they don't want to applaud, it means it's thoughtful.\n\n31:03.080 --> 31:05.080\nDo you know Adam Goldberg? Yes.\n\n31:05.080 --> 31:07.080\nHi, Adam.\n\n31:07.080 --> 31:09.080\nDid we see the air conditioning\n\n31:09.080 --> 31:11.080\nI fixed in here?\n\n31:11.080 --> 31:13.080\nWhat's that? Yeah, they said that.\n\n31:13.080 --> 31:15.080\nHow's that\n\n31:15.080 --> 31:17.080\nmatching up with your data?\n\n31:17.080 --> 31:19.080\nIt doesn't feel conditioned.\n\n31:19.080 --> 31:21.080\nYou know what I just saw\n\n31:21.080 --> 31:23.080\non Reddit? Really smart.\n\n31:23.080 --> 31:25.080\nAC, when you're alive,\n\n31:25.080 --> 31:27.080\nrefrigeration when you're dead.\n\n31:29.080 --> 31:31.080\nWhen you're alive,\n\n31:31.080 --> 31:33.080\nthis is called air conditioning,\n\n31:33.080 --> 31:35.080\nbut when you're a corpse, they call it refrigeration.\n\n31:35.080 --> 31:37.080\nBut it's essentially your\n\n31:37.080 --> 31:39.080\ncomplaining about the refrigeration, not the AC.\n\n31:43.080 --> 31:45.080\nWhat's a fan in that instance though?\n\n31:45.080 --> 31:47.080\nI don't know. I've never put a fan\n\n31:47.080 --> 31:49.080\non a dead body. It probably\n\n31:49.080 --> 31:51.080\ndoesn't help, I imagine.\n\n31:51.080 --> 31:53.080\nIt's more of a smell maker.\n\n31:53.080 --> 31:55.080\nYeah, it blows the smell.\n\n31:55.080 --> 31:57.080\nWhy would dead people complain about refrigeration?\n\n31:57.080 --> 31:59.080\nOr anything?\n\n31:59.080 --> 32:01.080\nThey wouldn't.\n\n32:01.080 --> 32:03.080\nWhy people might complain about them?\n\n32:03.080 --> 32:05.080\nIt's spoiled.\n\n32:05.080 --> 32:07.080\nI just want to say, I think,\n\n32:07.080 --> 32:09.080\nwell, okay, so\n\n32:09.080 --> 32:11.080\nif there's an expert\n\n32:11.080 --> 32:13.080\nin this group\n\n32:13.080 --> 32:15.080\nthat can speak to this,\n\n32:15.080 --> 32:17.080\nwe're going to bring you up, because I don't want\n\n32:17.080 --> 32:19.080\nto just babble about this and be wrong. I have a bunch of people tweet me.\n\n32:19.080 --> 32:21.080\nBut here's what I understand.\n\n32:21.080 --> 32:23.080\nI'm going to dump everything my head\n\n32:23.080 --> 32:25.080\nout into the table.\n\n32:25.080 --> 32:27.080\nCathode ray tube\n\n32:27.080 --> 32:29.080\ntelevisions,\n\n32:29.080 --> 32:31.080\nwhen you film them,\n\n32:31.080 --> 32:33.080\nlike sometimes there's that flicker that fly\n\n32:33.080 --> 32:35.080\noff into your face. There's a little bit of vodka.\n\n32:35.080 --> 32:37.080\nIt's a little bit of vodka.\n\n32:37.080 --> 32:39.080\nThe\n\n32:39.080 --> 32:41.080\ncats and dogs\n\n32:41.080 --> 32:43.080\nwhen they watch those old TVs,\n\n32:43.080 --> 32:45.080\nthe tube TVs, they\n\n32:45.080 --> 32:47.080\nbasically couldn't see shit on them.\n\n32:47.080 --> 32:49.080\nIt would just look like when you put a video camera\n\n32:49.080 --> 32:51.080\non a TV,\n\n32:51.080 --> 32:53.080\nunless you synced to the frame rate with special equipment,\n\n32:53.080 --> 32:55.080\nyou're seeing\n\n32:55.080 --> 32:57.080\nwhat a cat or a dog would see, which is just like a raster beam,\n\n32:57.080 --> 32:59.080\njust nothing.\n\n32:59.080 --> 33:01.080\nNow these HD TVs,\n\n33:01.080 --> 33:03.080\nbecause of the frame rate, I don't know\n\n33:03.080 --> 33:05.080\nwhat the fuck, my dog,\n\n33:05.080 --> 33:07.080\nI just sit with my dog and I just\n\n33:07.080 --> 33:09.080\nbring up YouTube videos of puppies\n\n33:09.080 --> 33:11.080\nand the dog just sits there,\n\n33:11.080 --> 33:13.080\nfreaks out.\n\n33:13.080 --> 33:15.080\nIt tries to look behind the wall for the\n\n33:15.080 --> 33:17.080\ndogs. It loves\n\n33:17.080 --> 33:19.080\nhorses. It loves other dogs.\n\n33:19.080 --> 33:21.080\nThen Aaron took a video\n\n33:21.080 --> 33:23.080\nof the dog, put it up on the screen\n\n33:23.080 --> 33:25.080\nand the dog\n\n33:25.080 --> 33:27.080\nhad a meltdown.\n\n33:27.080 --> 33:29.080\nAlso\n\n33:29.080 --> 33:31.080\nthe cat,\n\n33:31.080 --> 33:33.080\nat one point we were watching kitten videos\n\n33:33.080 --> 33:35.080\nand the cat just started watching and it was like,\n\n33:35.080 --> 33:37.080\nthis never happened. I've had cats my whole life.\n\n33:37.080 --> 33:39.080\nBut what changed is these screens.\n\n33:39.080 --> 33:41.080\nThey're all\n\n33:41.080 --> 33:43.080\nour little species.\n\n33:43.080 --> 33:45.080\nWe all have different models of camera in our eye and they all\n\n33:45.080 --> 33:47.080\noperate at different frame rates.\n\n33:47.080 --> 33:49.080\nAnd I believe that\n\n33:49.080 --> 33:51.080\nwhat's happened now that we're not really\n\n33:51.080 --> 33:53.080\npaying attention to is the fact that for the first\n\n33:53.080 --> 33:55.080\ntime in our lives\n\n33:55.080 --> 33:57.080\nour pets are watching television with us.\n\n33:57.080 --> 33:59.080\nWhich was a joke and\n\n33:59.080 --> 34:01.080\nscrooge, but like it's\n\n34:01.080 --> 34:03.080\nit's a real thing now.\n\n34:03.080 --> 34:05.080\nYeah, it's very, it's really weird\n\n34:05.080 --> 34:07.080\nto think that as we're approaching\n\n34:07.080 --> 34:09.080\nthe singularity, our pets\n\n34:09.080 --> 34:11.080\nare also approaching the singularity.\n\n34:11.080 --> 34:13.080\nThey might pick up the mantle\n\n34:13.080 --> 34:15.080\nand they could become like, yeah\n\n34:15.080 --> 34:17.080\ntheir dog would be like lifting a torch to\n\n34:17.080 --> 34:19.080\nan old cave painting of us\n\n34:19.080 --> 34:21.080\nshowing it TV.\n\n34:21.080 --> 34:23.080\nDidn't you say\n\n34:23.080 --> 34:25.080\nwhat would you say to me about the Planet of the Apes thing\n\n34:25.080 --> 34:27.080\nis they were going to take chimpanzees\n\n34:27.080 --> 34:29.080\nto see the Planet of the Apes?\n\n34:29.080 --> 34:31.080\nNo, I didn't say that, but yeah, they said\n\n34:31.080 --> 34:33.080\nOh, that was that, was that Alex?\n\n34:33.080 --> 34:35.080\nYeah, he said that they brought some chimps\n\n34:35.080 --> 34:37.080\nto watch Planet of the Apes and\n\n34:37.080 --> 34:39.080\nthey hated it or\n\n34:39.080 --> 34:41.080\nthey were like\n\n34:41.080 --> 34:43.080\nthey thought it had third act problems.\n\n34:43.080 --> 34:45.080\nThey thought it had third act problems.\n\n34:49.080 --> 34:51.080\nI don't know\n\n34:51.080 --> 34:53.080\nit got convoluted that story\n\n34:53.080 --> 34:55.080\nI think it was something like that\n\n34:55.080 --> 34:57.080\nbut it's probably also true.\n\n34:57.080 --> 34:59.080\nOh shit, we got to bring up\n\n34:59.080 --> 35:01.080\nokay, is Neil Berkley here? Neil are you in the back?\n\n35:01.080 --> 35:11.080\nCome on up Neil Berkley.\n\n35:11.080 --> 35:13.080\nI just took my own magic trick.\n\n35:15.080 --> 35:17.080\nI'm bringing up Neil because\n\n35:17.080 --> 35:19.080\nI get that jump sensation\n\n35:19.080 --> 35:21.080\nby the way, my whole life\n\n35:21.080 --> 35:23.080\nI've been deathly afraid of heights\n\n35:23.080 --> 35:25.080\nbecause every time I step near a lead\n\n35:25.080 --> 35:27.080\nyour dream about a high place I always jump off\n\n35:27.080 --> 35:29.080\nI float over\n\n35:29.080 --> 35:31.080\nsomething levitates me over the\n\n35:31.080 --> 35:33.080\nI don't float, I plummet to the concrete\n\n35:33.080 --> 35:35.080\nand then I wake up\n\n35:35.080 --> 35:37.080\nI wake up as I hit the concrete\n\n35:37.080 --> 35:39.080\nI always say I don't want to go up there\n\n35:39.080 --> 35:41.080\nI get a jump sensation, everyone makes fun of you\n\n35:41.080 --> 35:43.080\nand says that's stupid, why are you saying that\n\n35:43.080 --> 35:45.080\nyou're not going to jump off, but I swear\n\n35:45.080 --> 35:47.080\nevery time I'm on a high place\n\n35:47.080 -->

getting all stressed out\n\n57:01.080 --> 57:03.080\nand I couldn't figure out why\n\n57:03.080 --> 57:05.080\nand then I realized that\n\n57:05.080 --> 57:07.080\nthis is a sad story\n\n57:07.080 --> 57:09.080\nI may have told you this already\n\n57:09.080 --> 57:11.080\nbut in the Avengers\n\n57:11.080 --> 57:13.080\nBruce Banner explains\n\n57:13.080 --> 57:15.080\nhis secret with\n\n57:15.080

57:25.080\nyou know that Bruce Banner turns into Hulk when he gets angry\n\n57:25.080 --> 57:27.080\nand he can't control it\n\n57:27.080 --> 57:29.080\nand it's this running thing throughout the movie\n\n57:29.080 --> 57:31.080\nthat he's like now I figured out how to control it\n\n57:31.080 --> 57:33.080\nand they're like what's your secret\n\n57:33.080 --> 57:35.080\nand he's like I'll tell you later\n\n57:35.080 --> 57:37.080\nand then when he tells them\n\n57:37.080 --> 57:39.080\nhe finally tells them\n\n57:39.080 --> 57:41.080\nthat just as he's about to turn into the Hulk\n\n57:41.080 --> 57:43.080\nand punch some enormous space worm\n\n57:43.080 --> 57:45.080\nhe's like oh I never told you my secret\n\n57:45.080 --> 57:47.080\nit's that I'm always

shame\n\n58:07.080 --> 58:09.080\nmeaning that you\n\n58:09.080 --> 58:11.080\nfeel humiliation shame or meaning that you\n\n58:11.080 --> 58:13.080\nwould readily spout out something\n\n58:13.080 --> 58:15.080\nincredibly no it's that\n\n58:15.080 --> 58:17.080\nI think that in some ways\n\n58:17.080 --> 58:19.080\nI'm actually relatively immune\n\n58:19.080 --> 58:21.080\nto shame like I was having trouble\n\n58:21.080 --> 58:23.080\nthinking of times I've been embarrassed\n\n58:23.080 --> 58:25.080\nbut then I realized that at a certain point in my life\n\n58:25.080 --> 58:27.080\nthe embarrassment\n\n58:27.080 --> 58:29.080\nflooded over me so completely\n\n58:29.080 --> 58:31.080\nthat I lived in a universe\n\n58:31.080 --> 58:33.080\nof embarrassment and that became the background\n\n58:33.080 --> 58:35.080\nand then no new embarrassment\n\n58:35.080 --> 58:37.080\ncould penetrate\n\n58:37.080 --> 58:39.080\nand then it became a game of making sure\n\n58:39.080 --> 58:41.080\nthat anybody that comes near you knows\n\n58:41.080 --> 58:43.080\nthat they're an embarrassment town\n\n58:43.080 --> 58:45.080\nwell that's how I started to think of it\n\n58:45.080 --> 58:47.080\nI was like Hulk who goes there\n\n58:47.080 --> 58:49.080\nyou don't have to put your gun down\n\n58:49.080 --> 58:51.080\nbut you better know I\n\n58:51.080 --> 58:53.080\nshook my pants

59:15.080\nI would be in jail or something like that\n\n59:15.080 --> 59:17.080\nand that's how I feel because I'm so mean to myself\n\n59:17.080 --> 59:19.080\nand it's because if anyone in this room\n\n59:19.080 --> 59:21.080\ncould say something mean about me that I\n\n59:21.080 --> 59:23.080\nhaven't already thought of I would die\n\n59:23.080 --> 59:25.080\nso I have to be\n\n59:25.080

01:02:01.080\nyou know he was saying that like he doesn't care\n\n01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:03.080\nif um he\n\n01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:05.080\nrather it was roller\n\n01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:07.080\nit was not roller it was\n\n01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:09.080\n100% Matt Roller I'm 100% sure\n\n01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:11.080\nhe was saying if he got murdered\n\n01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:13.080\nhe would rather that the\n\n01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:15.080\nperson be an idiot\n\n01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:17.080\nwho just happened to\n\n01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:19.080\nmurder him than that it be a genius\n\n01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:21.080\nwho like he's like I don't want to be\n\n01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:23.080\npart of somebody's plan\n\n01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:25.080\nlike he was like and he was\n\n01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:27.080\nand I was like oh so you don't want to feel bested\n\n01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:29.080\nlike you don't want to like open your safe and there's\n\n01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:31.080\na bomb in there and you're like ah fuck\n\n01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:33.080\nand then it blows up but he was like no but he's like\n\n01:02:33.080 --> 01:02:35.080\nalso though I don't\n\n01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:37.080\nwant there to be\n\n01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:39.080\npeople shooting in a bank\n\n01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:41.080\nso that they can rob the museum\n\n01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:43.080\nand I get killed in the bank right\n\n01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:45.080\nhe doesn't want to be insignificant\n\n01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:47.080\nhe doesn't want to be a pawn yeah yeah\n\n01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:49.080\nso fucking fascinating\n\n01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:51.080\nand so uncharacteristically\n\n01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:53.080\nhonest for Roller\n\n01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:55.080\nI love that idea though\n\n01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:57.080\nI love that idea of the accidental murder\n\n01:02:57.080 --> 01:02:59.080\nversus the intentional murder\n\n01:02:59.080 --> 01:03:01.080\nbecause it's like to get back\n\n01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:03.080\nto the point of the show\n\n01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:05.080\nwhich is the conflict between Israel and Palestine\n\n01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:13.080\nwhich by the way\n\n01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:15.080\nI hear is simmering up\n\n01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:17.080\nit's simmering up friend\n\n01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:19.080\nbut it is interesting how\n\n01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:21.080\ntheir defense is\n\n01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:23.080\nwhen Hamas attacks Israel\n\n01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:25.080\nand they want to kill people\n\n01:03:25.080 --> 01:03:27.080\nit's an intentional thing\n\n01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:29.080\nlike when they kill kids a suicide bomber\n\n01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:31.080\nis wandered into a cafe\n\n01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:33.080\nand is looked around and be like alright there's like\n\n01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:35.080\n15 kids here let's do it\n\n01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:37.080\nwe're going to explode everybody around me\n\n01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:39.080\nbut when Israel\n\n01:03:39.080 --> 01:03:41.080\nkills kids it's like that was a fucking\n\n01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:43.080\naccident man we didn't mean to do it\n\n01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:45.080\nand somehow the accidental nature\n\n01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:47.080\nmakes what they're doing less\n\n01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:49.080\nsevere than the intentional nature\n\n01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:51.080\nbut it's really\n\n01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:53.080\nkind of even worse like if you're like\n\n01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:55.080\na clumsy being\n\n01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:57.080\nwandering through the world like constantly\n\n01:03:57.080 --> 01:03:59.080\nkilling kids\n\n01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:01.080\nthat's fucked up if like Israel\n\n01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:03.080\nwas some giant it's like I don't mean\n\n01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:05.080\nto do it but the kids just keep\n\n01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:07.080\ndying\n\n01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:09.080\nthat's a fucked up\n\n01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:11.080\ngiant that's like you should stop\n\n01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:13.080\nwalking around man\n\n01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:15.080\nin this\n\n01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:17.080\nin that harmonious spirit of candor\n\n01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:19.080\nI was just talking to my friend Raza who I mentioned earlier\n\n01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:21.080\nand this was Raza about how\n\n01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:23.080\nI have complete I now\n\n01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:25.080\nI'm not I'm a Jewish person who's\n\n01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:27.080\nnot super in love with Israel I\n\n01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:29.080\nthink Israel's anyway\n\n01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:31.080\nbut no\n\n01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:33.080\nno it's fine but no well the\n\n01:04:33.080 --> 01:04:35.080\nreason that maybe you should edit it out is that\n\n01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:37.080\nas I learned in my\n\n01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:39.080\nmore provocative days\n\n01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:41.080\nwhen I used to get an argument with everybody it's an extremely\n\n01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:45.080\nlike controversial like people\n\n01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:47.080\nfeel very strongly\n\n01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:49.080\nyou've never encountered anything like\n\n01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:51.080\nit ever before in your life\n\n01:04:53.080 --> 01:04:55.080\nand because of that I've gone to a place\n\n01:04:55.080 --> 01:04:57.080\nwhere I'm like I'm out\n\n01:04:57.080 --> 01:04:59.080\nme too I'm not even\n\n01:04:59.080 --> 01:05:01.080\nreading the news about it and to be\n\n01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:03.080\nand that fucking\n\n01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:05.080\nriddles me with guilt\n\n01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:07.080\nbecause I'm like I said I'm out\n\n01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:09.080\nand I don't even know\n\n01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:11.080\nI don't even know what's going on there's this guy who tweeted something\n\n01:05:11.080 --> 01:05:13.080\nout because I was involved\n\n01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:15.080\nwell you know I got out because\n\n01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:17.080\nbecause it might\n\n01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:19.080\nsomehow splash on me which is the\n\n01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:21.080\nworst that's terrible you can't do that\n\n01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:23.080\nyou know I tweeted\n\n01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:25.080\nthis dumb simple thing about\n\n01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:27.080\nhow you shouldn't kill kids\n\n01:05:27.080 --> 01:05:29.080\nand pretty soon somebody said\n\n01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:31.080\nit wasn't like it wasn't based\n\n01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:33.080\non any geography or religion\n\n01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:35.080\nit was just like you know\n\n01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:37.080\nit would be too bad like in the\n\n01:05:37.080 --> 01:05:39.080\n10 commandments they didn't say\n\n01:05:39.080 --> 01:05:41.080\nyou shouldn't kill kids that was the tweet\n\n01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:43.080\nand somebody really quickly was like\n\n01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:45.080\nwhy do you hate Israel\n\n01:05:45.080 --> 01:05:47.080\nyeah\n\n01:05:47.080 -->

01:05:55.080\nif you say don't kill kids\n\n01:05:55.080 --> 01:05:57.080\npeople are like man you must hate the Jews\n\n01:05:57.080 --> 01:05:59.080\nbut like something happened and you know\n\n01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:01.080\nNBC had this reporter and he was out with\n\n01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:03.080\nreporters and he saw these kids\n\n01:06:03.080 --> 01:06:05.080\nand a bomb fell on these kids and blew\n\n01:06:05.080 --> 01:06:07.080\nthem up the guy was real close\n\n01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:09.080\nand then he was talking about it on the news\n\n01:06:09.080 --> 01:06:11.080\nlike one might if they saw a bunch\n\n01:06:11.080 --> 01:06:13.080\nof kids explode 20 feet away\n\n01:06:13.080 --> 01:06:15.080\nand he got pulled by his\n\n01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:17.080\ncompany out of the industry\n\n01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:19.080\nthat's insane if you\n\n01:06:19.080 --> 01:06:21.080\nsaw that happen wouldn't you talk about it\n\n01:06:21.080 --> 01:06:23.080\nbut you know yes you have to\n\n01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:25.080\nI don't feel like that's a political stance\n\n01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:27.080\nI think I tweeted this and

their weapons they end up\n\n01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:33.080\nkilling kids and then\n\n01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:35.080\nthat makes the world turn against Israel\n\n01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:37.080\nso Israel is saying don't you\n\n01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:39.080\nget it Hamas is\n\n01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:41.080\norchestrating this entire situation\n\n01:08:41.080 --> 01:08:43.080\nso that it looks like we're killing\n\n01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:45.080\nkids when really all we're trying to do\n\n01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:47.080\nis get rid of weapons whereas the\n\n01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:49.080\nPalestinians argument is actually\n\n01:08:49.080 --> 01:08:51.080\nwe're stuck\n\n01:08:51.080 --> 01:08:53.080\nin this shitty\n\n01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:55.080\nshitty situation where

01:09:03.080\nDisney movies and Nickelodeon\n\n01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:05.080\nand they just want to have a normal life\n\n01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:07.080\nbut because they're\n\n01:09:07.080 --> 01:09:09.080\nbasically if you lived in Atwater Village\n\n01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:11.080\nand\n\n01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:13.080\nand you were at war\n\n01:09:13.080 --> 01:09:15.080\nwith Hollywood and there were\n\n01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:17.080\npeople in Atwater Village who would\n\n01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:19.080\nlaunch missiles into Hollywood and\n\n01:09:19.080 --> 01:09:21.080\nevery time that happened Hollywood\n\n01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:23.080\nwould fly over and blow up half of\n\n01:09:23.080 --> 01:09:25.080\nAtwater Village\n\n01:09:25.080 --> 01:09:27.080\nthat's the situation it's a

is\n\n01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:35.080\njust don't kill babies like if you can\n\n01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:37.080\navoid killing babies I would agree\n\n01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:39.080\nwith don't kill babies that's it\n\n01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:41.080\nlike that's the inarguable thing\n\n01:09:41.080 --> 01:09:43.080\nexcept if the conversation is about abortion\n\n01:09:43.080 --> 01:09:45.080\nwell no like\n\n01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:47.080\nin that case\n\n01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:49.080\nlet your freak flag fly\n\n01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:51.080\nyeah\n\n01:09:51.080 --> 01:09:53.080\nI have a weird conundrum\n\n01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:55.080\nbecause I'm going out tonight\n\n01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:57.080\nI don't want to steer the conversation\n\n01:09:57.080 --> 01:09:59.080\nare you going to talk about this\n\n01:09:59.080 --> 01:10:01.080\nsame situation\n\n01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:03.080\nI was going to try to put a little ribbon on it\n\n01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:05.080\nwhich is a brilliant idea for me\n\n01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:07.080\nI'm going to put a ribbon on the\n\n01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:09.080\nMiddle East conflict\n\n01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:11.080\nit's a weird situation I don't know\n\n01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:13.080\nthere's no right answer but\n\n01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:15.080\nthis is the worst\n\n01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:17.080\nI have a similar conundrum\n\n01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:19.080\nthat's like okay this always been weighing on me\n\n01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:21.080\nand I keep asking people about it\n\n01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:23.080\nit's very similar it's not similar\n\n01:10:23.080 --> 01:10:25.080\nbut if you walk into a\n\n01:10:25.080 --> 01:10:27.080\nbathroom and you saw cupcakes\n\n01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:29.080\nlike would you eat them\n\n01:10:29.080 --> 01:10:31.080\nwhere are they\n\n01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:33.080\nwhat do you mean if you saw cupcakes\n\n01:10:33.080 --> 01:10:35.080\nlike they're on\n\n01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:37.080\nthat counter thing that the sinks on probably\n\n01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:39.080\nare they in a plastic\n\n01:10:39.080 --> 01:10:41.080\nyou know case that's closed\n\n01:10:41.080 --> 01:10:43.080\nthey're in a plastic case but it's not closed\n\n01:10:43.080 --> 01:10:45.080\nwhat drugs are you on\n\n01:10:45.080 --> 01:10:47.080\nnone none\n\n01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:49.080\nI don't want a metagame but are the cupcakes\n\n01:10:49.080 --> 01:10:51.080\nGaza\n\n01:10:53.080 --> 01:10:55.080\nit's not really I guess not very much\n\n01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:57.080\nlike that conundrum\n\n01:10:57.080 --> 01:10:59.080\nbut it's been burning within my heart\n\n01:10:59.080 --> 01:11:01.080\nwell no we'll continue with this thought experiment\n\n01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:03.080\nwell that's it that's I mean what would you guys do\n\n01:11:03.080 --> 01:11:05.080\nyou guys are asking more questions\n\n01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:07.080\nwould you eat them\n\n01:11:07.080 --> 01:11:09.080\nno\n\n01:11:09.080 --> 01:11:11.080\nno I would not eat cupcakes\n\n01:11:11.080 --> 01:11:13.080\nsince I found out a bathroom\n\n01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:15.080\nwhat about you guys\n\n01:11:15.080 --> 01:11:17.080\nhomemade or store bought\n\n01:11:17.080 --> 01:11:19.080\nyou couldn't tell they look really well made\n\n01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:21.080\nwait are we playing Dungeons & Dragons right now\n\n01:11:23.080 --> 01:11:25.080\nno this is just\n\n01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:27.080\nI don't know\n\n01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:29.080\nI used to be super germaphobic at OCD\n\n01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:31.080\nand I mostly conquered it\n\n01:11:31.080 --> 01:11:33.080\nit's a nice bathroom though\n\n01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:35.080\nbut I realized part of the reason I conquered it\n\n01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:37.080\nwas because it was international\n\n01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:39.080\nand it was one day I'm really proud of the story\n\n01:11:39.080 --> 01:11:41.080\nI'm bragging right now\n\n01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:43.080\nI saw a quarter on the ground in New York City\n\n01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:45.080\nand I was like I shouldn't pick it up\n\n01:11:45.080 --> 01:11:47.080\nbecause who knows it could have been\n\n01:11:47.080 --> 01:11:49.080\nit could have been in shit or piss\n\n01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:51.080\nbut then I was like the difference between\n\n01:11:51.080 --> 01:11:53.080\nthat quarter and the quarters in my pocket\n\n01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:55.080\nis that I know that one was on the floor\n\n01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:57.080\nand then I'm like if I pick this quarter\n\n01:11:57.080 --> 01:11:59.080\nup right now and put it in my pocket\n\n01:11:59.080 --> 01:12:01.080\nand mix it in with the other quarters\n\n01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:03.080\nI wouldn't know which was which\n\n01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:05.080\nyou know so with the cupcakes\n\n01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:07.080\nno I wouldn't eat them in the bathroom\n\n01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:09.080\nwhat if you had a sack of cupcakes already\n\n01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:11.080\nand you didn't know where they were from\n\n01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:17.080\nwell I'm going to take\n\n01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:19.080\nmy serious answer to your question\n\n01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:21.080\nis that\n\n01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:23.080\nintellectually\n\n01:12:23.080 --> 01:12:25.080\nI feel that I should\n\n01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:27.080\nbe willing to eat the cupcakes\n\n01:12:27.080 --> 01:12:29.080\nand I wish I would\n\n01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:31.080\nbut I'm probably too neurotic\n\n01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:33.080\nabout you Duncan\n\n01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:35.080\nI wouldn't eat the cupcakes\n\n01:12:35.080 --> 01:12:37.080\nbut I wish\n\n01:12:37.080 --> 01:12:39.080\nI was that kind of I wish I were you\n\n01:12:39.080 --> 01:12:41.080\nbecause I think that a realized being\n\n01:12:41.080 --> 01:12:43.080\nan actualized being an Alan Watts level\n\n01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:45.080\nRom-Daz type being\n\n01:12:45.080 --> 01:12:47.080\nwould be like I'm eating the cupcakes\n\n01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:49.080\ndid Spencer say you would eat the cupcakes?\n\n01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:51.080\nyeah I think that like an awakened being\n\n01:12:51.080 --> 01:12:53.080\nI think Christ would eat the cupcakes\n\n01:12:53.080 --> 01:12:55.080\nbut why would he?\n\n01:12:55.080 --> 01:12:57.080\nis he hungry?\n\n01:12:57.080 --> 01:12:59.080\nwell what's the worst case scenario\n\n01:12:59.080 --> 01:13:01.080\nyou die, cyanide\n\n01:13:01.080 --> 01:13:03.080\nexactly that's awesome\n\n01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:05.080\nyou got killed because you ate a cupcake\n\n01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:07.080\nin the bathroom\n\n01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:09.080\nthen let's step it up\n\n01:13:09.080 --> 01:13:11.080\nfrom there you get really sick you almost\n\n01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:13.080\ndie you have to spend a lot of money\n\n01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:15.080\nlike that's an insane story you can make a kickstarter\n\n01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:17.080\noff of that\n\n01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:19.080\nyou know getting better that's you're sick\n\n01:13:19.080 --> 01:13:21.080\nthat's still an awesome story like every\n\n01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:23.080\npart of this equation is great\n\n01:13:23.080 --> 01:13:25.080\nNancy Grace would squirt\n\n01:13:25.080 --> 01:13:27.080\nas she found out\n\n01:13:27.080 --> 01:13:29.080\nthat somebody died from cupcake\n\n01:13:29.080 -->

the bar\n\n01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:39.080\nthis does in a weird\n\n01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:41.080\nway loop back around to your disturbing\n\n01:13:41.080 --> 01:13:43.080\npedophilia conversation from earlier\n\n01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:45.080\nin that the original question was\n\n01:13:45.080 --> 01:13:47.080\nhas society changed\n\n01:13:47.080 --> 01:13:49.080\nor have we just gotten more hysterical about it\n\n01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:51.080\nand as speaking as a former germaphobe\n\n01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:53.080\nrecovered germaphobe one of the things I\n\n01:13:53.080 --> 01:13:55.080\nrealized also is that\n\n01:13:55.080 --> 01:13:57.080\nwhere do you draw the line there's the illusion\n\n01:13:57.080 --> 01:13:59.080\nof security this also\n\n01:13:59.080 --> 01:14:01.080\n9-11 helped with this\n\n01:14:01.080 --> 01:14:03.080\nbut\n\n01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:05.080\nI used to help with the illusion\n\n01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:07.080\nno helped with recognizing that it is an illusion\n\n01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:09.080\nI in a public restroom used\n\n01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:11.080\nto be and this is still sort of true if there's\n\n01:14:11.080 -->
