00:00.000 --> 00:29.000
Hi, hi everybody, hello, I'm Elisha, welcome to Harmontown, I'm your cop trolling,

00:29.000 --> 00:39.000
now, welcome to the stage, your mayor, Ann Harmon.

00:39.000 --> 00:52.000
Alright, thank you. Another big crowd. You haven't been here lately.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
No, I haven't.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
There's a lot of big crowds lately.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
That's good.

00:56.000 --> 00:56.500
Good.

00:56.500 --> 00:58.040
So that Yahoo influence.

00:58.040 --> 00:59.540
Yep.

00:59.540 --> 01:02.920
A lot of people with those Yahoo email addresses,

01:02.920 --> 01:04.680
you know, I'm doing a TV show for Yahoo now.

01:04.680 --> 01:05.840
I don't even know if you know that.

01:05.840 --> 01:07.040
I haven't talked to you in a long time.

01:07.040 --> 01:07.040
I know that.

01:07.040 --> 01:07.840
I do know that.

01:07.840 --> 01:08.340
OK.

01:08.340 --> 01:11.160
I don't know how it's associated with Netanyahu, though.

01:11.160 --> 01:12.160
No.

01:12.160 --> 01:15.800
I mean, I don't think they ever claimed that it should be.

01:15.800 --> 01:17.040
That was just a coincidence.

01:17.040 --> 01:18.880
We're all tied into Netanyahu, though.

01:18.880 --> 01:21.000
I mean, everyone's tied to Netanyahu, yes.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.320
Because he's starting World War III, so.

01:23.320 --> 01:24.520
It's a serious issue.

01:24.520 --> 01:30.760
And you should apply for the appropriate email domain

01:30.760 --> 01:32.640
to reflect that.

01:32.640 --> 01:34.760
Guest Comptroller Duncan Tressall, everybody.

01:34.760 --> 01:35.260
Oh!

01:35.260 --> 01:35.760
Oh!

01:35.760 --> 01:36.260
Oh!

01:36.260 --> 01:36.760
Oh!

01:36.760 --> 01:37.260
Oh!

01:37.260 --> 01:37.760
Oh!

01:37.760 --> 01:38.260
Oh!

01:38.260 --> 01:38.760
Oh!

01:38.760 --> 01:40.120
Hello.

01:40.120 --> 01:42.600
Jeff is in Nashville.

01:42.600 --> 01:43.640
We don't know why.

01:43.640 --> 01:45.000
Jeff's just in Nashville.

01:45.000 --> 01:45.800
He's just hanging out.

01:45.800 --> 01:46.800
He's Instagramming.

01:46.800 --> 01:50.480
He's dicking around.

01:50.480 --> 01:53.080
Captioning things like, I'm finally home.

01:53.080 --> 01:56.080
So, so, fuck you.

01:56.080 --> 01:57.080
Fine.

01:57.080 --> 01:58.080
Go home.

01:58.080 --> 02:01.080
You really don't know why he's there?

02:01.080 --> 02:02.080
No.

02:02.080 --> 02:03.080
I never know.

02:03.080 --> 02:04.080
I don't ask.

02:04.080 --> 02:08.080
The thing with Jeff is, you don't want to encourage him.

02:08.080 --> 02:13.080
I just, you don't want to, you don't want to ask him things and go to him with needs.

02:13.080 --> 02:14.080
He just abuses it.

02:14.080 --> 02:21.080
That's what they said about John Wayne Gacy.

02:21.080 --> 02:24.080
They said that you don't want to encourage him.

02:24.080 --> 02:26.080
Don't ask him questions.

02:26.080 --> 02:28.080
He likes to dress like a clown.

02:28.080 --> 02:29.080
Hang out with kids.

02:29.080 --> 02:30.080
It's fine.

02:30.080 --> 02:31.080
But also, don't encourage him.

02:31.080 --> 02:34.080
I've been a lot of people encourage John Wayne Gacy.

02:34.080 --> 02:35.080
That's the thing.

02:35.080 --> 02:39.080
Like, if you encourage Jeff Davis, you're going to have a John Wayne Gacy situation in your

02:39.080 --> 02:41.080
hands in like two weeks tops.

02:41.080 --> 02:43.080
All right.

02:43.080 --> 02:45.080
So, what are we talking about tonight?

02:45.080 --> 02:46.080
Let's see here.

02:46.080 --> 02:50.080
Bring up my Evernote.

02:50.080 --> 02:54.080
One thing I would like to talk about is the Uber ride that I had to work today.

02:54.080 --> 03:00.080
I had to, I had to drive to work and didn't want to drive, took an Uber.

03:00.080 --> 03:05.080
And the guy, sometimes the Uber app, you can see the black car and you can watch.

03:05.080 --> 03:07.080
Sometimes the guy, it's foreshadowing.

03:07.080 --> 03:09.080
Like, you know, you got a bad guy.

03:09.080 --> 03:14.080
It's like the black car is like driving around in circles all around.

03:14.080 --> 03:18.080
Like, just going around your house, just watching it.

03:18.080 --> 03:22.080
Like, if you're watching like a six-year-old play Pac-Man, there's like this car, I can't

03:22.080 --> 03:23.080
go around.

03:23.080 --> 03:24.080
Like, oh, that's one of these guys.

03:24.080 --> 03:25.080
Guy pulls up.

03:25.080 --> 03:26.080
Now I'm late for work.

03:26.080 --> 03:28.080
But I'm the boss who cares.

03:28.080 --> 03:31.080
But I get in the thing and then you have that conversation.

03:31.080 --> 03:35.080
You're like, okay, these are more red flags because you're like, okay, I'm going to Burbank

03:35.080 --> 03:37.080
and he's like, Bur-Bork?

03:37.080 --> 03:41.080
I'm like, Burbank, Burbank.

03:41.080 --> 03:45.080
It's like, B-O-R-M-A-R-T.

03:45.080 --> 03:47.080
No, that's Bor-Mart.

03:47.080 --> 03:52.080
That's a fictional planet, Burbank.

03:52.080 --> 03:57.080
You can't have not been here long enough that you couldn't do, like it's Burbank.

03:57.080 --> 04:02.080
And it's fine that you're that new, but why are you driving anyone anywhere for money?

04:02.080 --> 04:03.080
That's insane.

04:03.080 --> 04:09.080
I'm not driving and I've been here for 20 years because I'm afraid I'll get lost.

04:09.080 --> 04:12.080
And so I called you Bor-Mart.

04:12.080 --> 04:16.080
So he types the thing in and then he's like, he can't get out of my neighborhood.

04:16.080 --> 04:18.080
He doesn't know where the thing is.

04:18.080 --> 04:21.080
And I was driving around and I'm like, go left, go right.

04:21.080 --> 04:22.080
Now you're the thing.

04:22.080 --> 04:23.080
He gets in the freeway.

04:23.080 --> 04:27.080
He starts going 90 miles per hour to Burbank.

04:27.080 --> 04:32.080
And then I'm like, okay, this is how I die and I'm going to, but I'm not going out.

04:32.080 --> 04:35.080
I'm not going to be one of these people that dies going, I don't want to die.

04:35.080 --> 04:37.080
I'm going to go out, check in my email.

04:37.080 --> 04:42.080
So I check my email and then I'm looking at it and getting grossed and that stuff.

04:42.080 --> 04:44.080
And then I feel the car slowing.

04:44.080 --> 04:46.080
I feel it.

04:46.080 --> 04:51.080
And then I look up and I'm like, why are we slowing?

04:51.080 --> 04:53.080
I didn't feel it get off anything.

04:53.080 --> 04:59.080
Like usually there's more of that kind of like events where your unconscious brain knows you're getting off the freeway.

04:59.080 --> 05:00.080
Whether you're listening.

05:00.080 --> 05:06.080
So I look up and there's this exit at Burbank and you can either go west or east.

05:06.080 --> 05:10.080
And so there's a little fork there, but you're on the freeway.

05:10.080 --> 05:12.080
He has stopped.

05:12.080 --> 05:15.080
There's SUV.

05:15.080 --> 05:18.080
Probably not his SUV.

05:18.080 --> 05:20.080
Probably a family member's SUV.

05:20.080 --> 05:23.080
And he is like, he's going, sir?

05:23.080 --> 05:26.080
And I looked up and I went, oh Jesus.

05:26.080 --> 05:28.080
And he went, yeah, which way?

05:28.080 --> 05:30.080
And I went west.

05:30.080 --> 05:33.080
Wherever the thing that you put.

05:33.080 --> 05:35.080
And he's like, okay.

05:35.080 --> 05:39.080
And he starts the car on the freeway and he keeps going like it was his driveway.

05:39.080 --> 05:41.080
And like this was all normal.

05:41.080 --> 05:43.080
He pulls over the thing.

05:43.080 --> 05:53.080
So after that, so the block span between that and getting dropped off at Starburns Industries and Burbank where I went to work today.

05:53.080 --> 05:56.080
I'm thinking to myself, all right, Harmon, this is it.

05:56.080 --> 05:59.080
You're giving this guy less than five stars.

05:59.080 --> 06:01.080
Finally, this is it.

06:01.080 --> 06:03.080
I've never done it before.

06:03.080 --> 06:07.080
I've never done it because there's this thing with the Uber culture where you're like,

06:07.080 --> 06:13.080
the people that you might give four stars, the whole reason you might give them four stars,

06:13.080 --> 06:15.080
I create this backstory for them.

06:15.080 --> 06:17.080
And I'm like, well, then they're fucked.

06:17.080 --> 06:20.080
And like, how is that going to help society?

06:20.080 --> 06:25.080
And like, maybe the bad drivers should get more encouragement.

06:25.080 --> 06:31.080
I'm not going to be the guy that knocks a guy off the fucking Cubert thing.

06:31.080 --> 06:33.080
There was a thing called Cubert.

06:33.080 --> 06:35.080
Look at him.

06:35.080 --> 06:37.080
So in the one block, I'm resolved.

06:37.080 --> 06:39.080
I'm like, four stars.

06:39.080 --> 06:41.080
That's enough for this guy.

06:41.080 --> 06:43.080
He's stopped on the freeway.

06:43.080 --> 06:45.080
Four stars, I'm thinking.

06:45.080 --> 06:48.080
He pulls up to the curb to let me out.

06:48.080 --> 06:57.080
And then I'm like, and an Uber exchange, like, you don't have to change any money.

06:57.080 --> 06:59.080
That's the nice thing about Uber.

06:59.080 --> 07:01.080
It's like, you're done.

07:01.080 --> 07:03.080
You can leap out of the car and run away.

07:03.080 --> 07:07.080
He stops and he turns back and he says, like, OK, thank you very much.

07:07.080 --> 07:08.080
It's so nice.

07:08.080 --> 07:09.080
Thank you very much.

07:09.080 --> 07:12.080
And I don't know if that's a fair accent or if that's...

07:12.080 --> 07:14.080
And I don't know what...

07:14.080 --> 07:17.080
So, and I go, thank you, thank you.

07:17.080 --> 07:20.080
And I swear to God, this is what I heard.

07:20.080 --> 07:22.080
I can't verify that this is what he said.

07:22.080 --> 07:24.080
This is exactly what I heard.

07:24.080 --> 07:27.080
He said, I make a five stars.

07:27.080 --> 07:36.080
And I almost started crying as I got out and I fucking, you better...

07:36.080 --> 07:38.080
I wish I could give him six stars.

07:38.080 --> 07:40.080
No, no, you...

07:40.080 --> 07:42.080
I make a five stars.

07:42.080 --> 07:44.080
He sounded like fucking Mario.

07:44.080 --> 07:48.080
I make the cake for my wife today.

07:48.080 --> 07:50.080
I drive you all around.

07:50.080 --> 07:52.080
I make a five stars.

07:52.080 --> 07:54.080
I couldn't fucking deal with it.

07:54.080 --> 07:58.080
He's the guy in Saving Private Ryan, Benny Grable, Benny Grable.

07:58.080 --> 08:01.080
That's how the Holocaust happens, man.

08:01.080 --> 08:04.080
OK, connect those dots for me.

08:04.080 --> 08:06.080
I thought that's how you avoid the Holocaust.

08:06.080 --> 08:07.080
No!

08:07.080 --> 08:09.080
You have to... Here's the thing.

08:09.080 --> 08:10.080
All right.

08:10.080 --> 08:15.080
That guy, what happens the next time he stops on the interstate?

08:15.080 --> 08:16.080
Right.

08:16.080 --> 08:18.080
That's the guy that puts the knife that's going...

08:18.080 --> 08:21.080
At the end of Saving Private Ryan.

08:21.080 --> 08:24.080
Oh, no, no, no.

08:24.080 --> 08:25.080
I make a five stars.

08:25.080 --> 08:27.080
I make a five stars.

08:27.080 --> 08:29.080
You're right, you're right, you're right.

08:29.080 --> 08:31.080
Hundreds of people get died.

08:31.080 --> 08:32.080
Hundreds of people.

08:32.080 --> 08:33.080
You're right, I fucked up.

08:33.080 --> 08:34.080
I fucked up again.

08:34.080 --> 08:36.080
I fucked up.

08:36.080 --> 08:40.080
We need a special Uber drone that follows Uber passengers

08:40.080 --> 08:43.080
and checks up on their ratings so that you can wait their rating

08:43.080 --> 08:45.080
because I'm just going to give you five stars

08:45.080 --> 08:47.080
if you fucking pick me up.

08:47.080 --> 08:48.080
That's it.

08:48.080 --> 08:49.080
Because I can't handle it.

08:49.080 --> 08:50.080
I can't handle the pressure.

08:50.080 --> 08:51.080
I got off on it.

08:51.080 --> 08:54.080
I got off on the idea when it was introduced

08:54.080 --> 08:58.080
because I was so sick of the no-star taxi system

08:58.080 --> 09:01.080
where the only rule was that you call a taxi

09:01.080 --> 09:04.080
and if they got time for you, they'll try to make the time.

09:04.080 --> 09:07.080
And if you and all don't fit into their system,

09:07.080 --> 09:10.080
you can go fuck yourself and there's no communication

09:10.080 --> 09:12.080
and it's a public utility and they have a monopoly.

09:12.080 --> 09:15.080
And so when Uber came out, it was like, fuck the police.

09:15.080 --> 09:16.080
Yeah!

09:16.080 --> 09:18.080
I don't know how the police are involved,

09:18.080 --> 09:20.080
but fuck everybody.

09:20.080 --> 09:22.080
Fuck the taxi police.

09:22.080 --> 09:24.080
And it was like, it was so great because you felt the fear.

09:24.080 --> 09:25.080
You could feel the fear.

09:25.080 --> 09:26.080
You could taste it.

09:26.080 --> 09:27.080
Everybody that picked you up was like,

09:27.080 --> 09:31.080
oh shit, I don't know how to Uber, right?

09:31.080 --> 09:34.080
And it was just like fucking everything had turned on its ear.

09:34.080 --> 09:35.080
The consumer was in control.

09:35.080 --> 09:37.080
The people ruled.

09:37.080 --> 09:40.080
Capitalism was being presented in its proper form.

09:40.080 --> 09:42.080
There were people competing for your favor.

09:42.080 --> 09:44.080
It felt good.

09:44.080 --> 09:45.080
But it had nothing to do.

09:45.080 --> 09:49.080
And then slowly but surely, you know, your girlfriend gets her Uber ride.

09:49.080 --> 09:50.080
She's like, that guy was creepy.

09:50.080 --> 09:51.080
What do you mean?

09:51.080 --> 09:52.080
Oh, I'll tell you a story.

09:52.080 --> 09:53.080
Ah!

09:53.080 --> 09:54.080
What did you do?

09:54.080 --> 09:56.080
I gave him three stars.

09:56.080 --> 09:58.080
Jesus.

09:58.080 --> 10:02.080
I think it's our hitchhiking.

10:02.080 --> 10:04.080
It's like our generation's hitchhiking.

10:04.080 --> 10:06.080
Like when you talk to like people from the 60s,

10:06.080 --> 10:09.080
it was a normal thing to like just hitch a ride.

10:09.080 --> 10:11.080
It wasn't something that would,

10:11.080 --> 10:15.080
now if you hear someone as a hitchhiker or as hitchhiked,

10:15.080 --> 10:17.080
you look at them in terror,

10:17.080 --> 10:20.080
because the idea is like one out of three hitchhikers

10:20.080 --> 10:24.080
ends up in an alligator's stomach in a swamp.

10:24.080 --> 10:26.080
Can we talk about that for a second?

10:26.080 --> 10:29.080
Because like, it's that thing,

10:29.080 --> 10:33.080
like what are these social changes that happen?

10:33.080 --> 10:36.080
How much are they reflective of actual incidents?

10:36.080 --> 10:39.080
Because like, we're all aware,

10:39.080 --> 10:41.080
some of you are so young that you might have been

10:41.080 --> 10:42.080
aware of the transition,

10:42.080 --> 10:48.080
but this society is obsessed with fucking children.

10:48.080 --> 10:53.080
Like, if you mention a child,

10:53.080 --> 10:56.080
if you mention, if you say,

10:56.080 --> 10:59.080
oh my cousin, I went with my 11 year old cousin to the thing,

10:59.080 --> 11:02.080
someone in the writer's room, someone around you

11:02.080 --> 11:04.080
is going to tee up the fuck,

11:04.080 --> 11:08.080
the fact that like, it's like the young child,

11:08.080 --> 11:10.080
it's like the dot connection to...

11:10.080 --> 11:12.080
It's called the Nancy Grace effect.

11:12.080 --> 11:16.080
It's like, it's from Nancy Grace,

11:16.080 --> 11:21.080
because if you watch Nancy Grace for more than two episodes,

11:21.080 --> 11:25.080
and then you drive down the road and see a kid alone,

11:25.080 --> 11:28.080
something will flash through your mind where you're like,

11:28.080 --> 11:30.080
should I rape and kill that kid?

11:30.080 --> 11:32.080
Exactly.

11:32.080 --> 11:39.080
Thank you for putting into words what I couldn't...

11:39.080 --> 11:42.080
I don't know why that was hard to articulate.

11:42.080 --> 11:46.080
No, but seriously, on a more gray level than that,

11:46.080 --> 11:50.080
but I mean, that's the comedic, glib, exaggerated thing,

11:50.080 --> 11:52.080
the condition that we're...

11:52.080 --> 11:54.080
But that's what we're all...

11:54.080 --> 11:56.080
It starts with people telling you

11:56.080 --> 11:58.080
that everyone out there wants to fuck your kid,

11:58.080 --> 12:01.080
and then that turns into a joke.

12:01.080 --> 12:03.080
Because it's like, it's in the zeitgeist.

12:03.080 --> 12:05.080
So it's like, kid-fucking, that's a thing.

12:05.080 --> 12:07.080
Hey, everybody hear about the kid-fucking?

12:07.080 --> 12:14.080
The thing about kid-fucking is that it's zero overhead...

12:14.080 --> 12:22.080
As a news item, as a rumor, as a myth,

12:22.080 --> 12:27.080
it is zero overhead, it costs nothing to create that myth,

12:27.080 --> 12:32.080
and it profits you mythically like a thousand percent.

12:32.080 --> 12:35.080
If you're Verizon, it's zero risk high yield

12:35.080 --> 12:38.080
if you're in the business of affecting people.

12:38.080 --> 12:42.080
Or if you're an advertiser, because if there's a famous...

12:42.080 --> 12:45.080
If a child rapist gets arrested,

12:45.080 --> 12:48.080
then that creates more viewers to the news

12:48.080 --> 12:49.080
and more viewers...

12:49.080 --> 12:51.080
Absolutely, everyone wants to know, oh my god, did you hear?

12:51.080 --> 12:53.080
There's a guy, he fucked a kid.

12:53.080 --> 12:56.080
News at 11, I'm like, oh god, what does he look like?

12:56.080 --> 12:57.080
How did he do it?

12:57.080 --> 12:59.080
What did he say to do it?

12:59.080 --> 13:02.080
What did it look like when he did it?

13:02.080 --> 13:04.080
We're fucking horrible people,

13:04.080 --> 13:06.080
and we watch the Sopranos, and we watch Casino,

13:06.080 --> 13:08.080
and we watch the...

13:08.080 --> 13:10.080
Every time somebody eats a bunch of people,

13:10.080 --> 13:13.080
puts their heads in the fridge, the idea of kid-fucking,

13:13.080 --> 13:20.080
it's perfectly fine for us to be...

13:20.080 --> 13:28.080
Fucking voyeuristically fucking stirred up by this shit,

13:28.080 --> 13:31.080
because my god, I mean, of course,

13:31.080 --> 13:33.080
if you're in a society and you're happy,

13:33.080 --> 13:35.080
one of the biggest things you're going to think about

13:35.080 --> 13:38.080
is what if this all fell apart, holy shit?

13:38.080 --> 13:40.080
If you build a city in Minecraft,

13:40.080 --> 13:43.080
you start to think about, oh shit,

13:43.080 --> 13:45.080
how do I keep this safe from creepers?

13:45.080 --> 13:51.080
I put it in terms our audience could understand.

13:51.080 --> 13:54.080
As soon as you have something cool going,

13:54.080 --> 13:56.080
of course your next thought is,

13:56.080 --> 13:59.080
what if somebody fucks it up?

13:59.080 --> 14:01.080
So you love your kid, you love your kid,

14:01.080 --> 14:03.080
like my mom did, he's six years old,

14:03.080 --> 14:05.080
you take him to the shopping mall,

14:05.080 --> 14:08.080
I got to go to the bathroom, my mom's not a boy,

14:08.080 --> 14:10.080
so she's not going to come to the boys' room with me,

14:10.080 --> 14:11.080
I don't know, I'm at that age,

14:11.080 --> 14:13.080
I'm going to go to the bathroom by myself at the mall,

14:13.080 --> 14:15.080
my mom's going to wait outside at Orange Julius.

14:15.080 --> 14:17.080
What's she going to say to me?

14:17.080 --> 14:20.080
She's going to say, well, I'll tell you what she did say.

14:20.080 --> 14:23.080
Don't talk to anybody, don't let anybody touch you,

14:23.080 --> 14:25.080
because there are guys out there that'll try to talk to you

14:25.080 --> 14:29.080
and touch you and then they'll cut off your penis with a knife.

14:29.080 --> 14:31.080
Good mom, good mom.

14:31.080 --> 14:34.080
Really, in the strictest sense, good mom.

14:34.080 --> 14:40.080
In terms of keeping your kid from getting his cock cut off,

14:40.080 --> 14:43.080
like doing her job individually,

14:43.080 --> 14:45.080
but then we were part of this honeycomb,

14:45.080 --> 14:47.080
and it's like, now you're clicking forward on emails,

14:47.080 --> 14:48.080
oh, there's a guy out there,

14:48.080 --> 14:50.080
he's waiting in the Toys R Us parking lot,

14:50.080 --> 14:53.080
and what he does is he puts a Donald Duck under the tire

14:53.080 --> 14:54.080
and then he puts a key next to him,

14:54.080 --> 14:56.080
and you get the key, it sucks on your dick,

14:56.080 --> 14:57.080
and he cuts it off,

14:57.080 --> 14:59.080
and he puts it in the Donald Duck,

14:59.080 --> 15:00.080
and then he mails it,

15:00.080 --> 15:04.080
and if you don't forward this, it couldn't happen to you.

15:04.080 --> 15:06.080
It just becomes this thing,

15:06.080 --> 15:08.080
and all the energy behind it, though,

15:08.080 --> 15:16.080
as you said before, it's driven by this insane primal fear

15:16.080 --> 15:18.080
we have underneath us.

15:18.080 --> 15:23.080
People who are tremendously afraid of heights like me,

15:23.080 --> 15:26.080
when they look over a balcony,

15:26.080 --> 15:28.080
what they'll tell people,

15:28.080 --> 15:30.080
because we've studied these people for ages,

15:30.080 --> 15:34.080
there is an inextricable phenomenon

15:34.080 --> 15:36.080
involved in the tremendous fear of heights

15:36.080 --> 15:39.080
that, and it makes no sense,

15:39.080 --> 15:41.080
but it's like you feel,

15:41.080 --> 15:43.080
as you're looking over the edge of the balcony,

15:43.080 --> 15:45.080
like you're gonna jump off,

15:45.080 --> 15:47.080
like you wanna jump off,

15:47.080 --> 15:49.080
like you know how,

15:49.080 --> 15:52.080
and you could really easily,

15:52.080 --> 15:56.080
and you fantasize about what it would be like to jump off,

15:56.080 --> 15:58.080
and that's what vertigo's all about,

15:58.080 --> 15:59.080
vertigo's not the phrase,

15:59.080 --> 16:01.080
but just that fear that people feel

16:01.080 --> 16:04.080
when they can't go near the edge of the balcony,

16:04.080 --> 16:06.080
they feel like,

16:06.080 --> 16:08.080
I'm only a couple quick born identity moves

16:08.080 --> 16:10.080
for just,

16:10.080 --> 16:12.080
and I know exactly what they are,

16:12.080 --> 16:14.080
because I'm afraid of heights.

16:14.080 --> 16:19.080
People, everybody has become obsessed with fucking children.

16:19.080 --> 16:21.080
We are looking at children now,

16:21.080 --> 16:22.080
and going like,

16:22.080 --> 16:25.080
oh, I wonder if anyone thinks I'd like to fuck that kid.

16:25.080 --> 16:27.080
That's the end result, isn't it?

16:27.080 --> 16:32.080
That's why there's something so satanic about the fact

16:32.080 --> 16:36.080
that the reason we all know about child fuckers

16:36.080 --> 16:38.080
is not because there's some organization

16:38.080 --> 16:40.080
that really wants to get the news

16:40.080 --> 16:42.080
of child fuckers out into the world.

16:42.080 --> 16:44.080
The reason we know about child fuckers

16:44.080 --> 16:47.080
is that people tend to stay through the commercial break

16:47.080 --> 16:49.080
to find out about the child fucker.

16:49.080 --> 16:50.080
I would, yeah.

16:50.080 --> 16:52.080
Well, that's a really dark thing

16:52.080 --> 16:55.080
when you realize that every time a child gets fucked,

16:55.080 --> 16:58.080
then it sells a certain amount of iPhones or cars.

16:58.080 --> 16:59.080
Yeah.

16:59.080 --> 17:02.080
So there's like a profit,

17:02.080 --> 17:05.080
the profit of corporations increases

17:05.080 --> 17:07.080
every time a child is fucked.

17:07.080 --> 17:11.080
There's a direct profit increase that happens.

17:11.080 --> 17:12.080
That's where it gets like,

17:12.080 --> 17:13.080
if someone came up to you,

17:13.080 --> 17:15.080
if you're walking down the sidewalk

17:15.080 --> 17:17.080
and the guy comes up to you and he's like,

17:17.080 --> 17:19.080
hey, do you want to hear this story about a child

17:19.080 --> 17:21.080
that got raped and fucked?

17:21.080 --> 17:24.080
And you're like, yeah, I'd love to.

17:24.080 --> 17:26.080
And he's like, okay, great,

17:26.080 --> 17:28.080
but let me tell you about the new iPhone

17:28.080 --> 17:29.080
right there.

17:29.080 --> 17:32.080
I'm like, what the fuck's wrong with you?

17:32.080 --> 17:33.080
It's so dark.

17:33.080 --> 17:36.080
But that's what the news does every single night.

17:36.080 --> 17:38.080
That's their function.

17:38.080 --> 17:39.080
Yeah.

17:39.080 --> 17:41.080
But the big question is,

17:41.080 --> 17:42.080
and it's not a rhetorical question,

17:42.080 --> 17:43.080
because I don't know,

17:43.080 --> 17:45.080
because I was raised in the 70s,

17:45.080 --> 17:47.080
so lots of stuff has changed.

17:47.080 --> 17:49.080
The population of the planet has doubled.

17:49.080 --> 17:55.080
Is there actually more of this going on?

17:55.080 --> 17:56.080
Don't know.

17:56.080 --> 17:58.080
I think, you know,

17:58.080 --> 18:00.080
I was hoping maybe somebody in the audience

18:00.080 --> 18:01.080
would go like,

18:01.080 --> 18:06.080
I am a child fuck statistician.

18:06.080 --> 18:08.080
It's increased 200%.

18:08.080 --> 18:09.080
But I would even then say,

18:09.080 --> 18:11.080
it's like, well, okay, it increased 200%,

18:11.080 --> 18:12.080
so did the population.

18:12.080 --> 18:14.080
But it's bad to fuck kids now.

18:14.080 --> 18:15.080
Like Socrates, when Socrates-

18:15.080 --> 18:17.080
It's as bad as ever.

18:17.080 --> 18:19.080
No, it used to be okay.

18:19.080 --> 18:23.080
Socrates was like a legendary child fucker, right?

18:23.080 --> 18:28.080
If you read some of Socrates' writings,

18:28.080 --> 18:31.080
he talks about, there's some terrible,

18:31.080 --> 18:32.080
it's free on Kendall,

18:32.080 --> 18:34.080
I remember stumbling upon it.

18:34.080 --> 18:36.080
But it's really spooky,

18:36.080 --> 18:39.080
because Socrates is trying to seduce

18:39.080 --> 18:41.080
a 14-year-old boy.

18:41.080 --> 18:43.080
It's like a process of like,

18:43.080 --> 18:46.080
so I think that's why they gave him a hemlock.

18:46.080 --> 18:47.080
I think that's why they killed him,

18:47.080 --> 18:50.080
is because he was constantly fucking kids.

18:50.080 --> 18:52.080
But he used to be okay.

18:52.080 --> 18:55.080
Like now it's bad, but it used to be okay.

18:55.080 --> 18:57.080
Guys, I didn't invent this.

18:57.080 --> 18:59.080
I do think that like,

18:59.080 --> 19:01.080
it was an okay thing at one point.

19:01.080 --> 19:03.080
I make a five stars.

19:11.080 --> 19:13.080
Can you tell me about these Japanese robots

19:13.080 --> 19:15.080
you were telling me about?

19:15.080 --> 19:18.080
Yes, very excited about this.

19:18.080 --> 19:21.080
Next year, they're releasing

19:21.080 --> 19:26.080
the first consumer-based humanoid robot

19:26.080 --> 19:29.080
that has hands.

19:29.080 --> 19:30.080
The videos I've seen,

19:30.080 --> 19:32.080
it mostly just seems to dance and stuff,

19:32.080 --> 19:37.080
but it has a thumb and hands

19:37.080 --> 19:39.080
that seem to work really well,

19:39.080 --> 19:40.080
which means that it theoretically

19:40.080 --> 19:42.080
is going to be able to go to your refrigerator,

19:42.080 --> 19:45.080
bring you a beer,

19:45.080 --> 19:48.080
stab you to death in the night.

19:48.080 --> 19:51.080
If someone hacks it.

19:51.080 --> 19:53.080
But yeah, these are coming out next year.

19:53.080 --> 19:56.080
It's like the very first wave of robots

19:56.080 --> 19:59.080
that are going to inhabit our homes

19:59.080 --> 20:01.080
within the next 20 years.

20:01.080 --> 20:02.080
When you go to someone's house,

20:02.080 --> 20:04.080
if they don't have a robot,

20:04.080 --> 20:05.080
it'll be the same thing

20:05.080 --> 20:07.080
as like not having a refrigerator.

20:07.080 --> 20:08.080
Or a VCR in the 80s,

20:08.080 --> 20:10.080
like you go to your friend's house,

20:10.080 --> 20:12.080
it's like, oh, you know,

20:12.080 --> 20:14.080
my remote has a cord on it that goes to the TV.

20:14.080 --> 20:17.080
Mine doesn't, nerd.

20:17.080 --> 20:19.080
That's how little kids will be going over.

20:19.080 --> 20:21.080
The fucking plastic dude will come out.

20:21.080 --> 20:22.080
How wild, Steve?

20:22.080 --> 20:23.080
That's it.

20:23.080 --> 20:25.080
Want a beer?

20:25.080 --> 20:27.080
And it'll do it all fucked up,

20:27.080 --> 20:28.080
but everybody will be like,

20:28.080 --> 20:29.080
get a robot.

20:29.080 --> 20:31.080
Does it seem,

20:31.080 --> 20:33.080
is it like now that we've gotten

20:33.080 --> 20:35.080
to the bottom of the pedophilia thing

20:35.080 --> 20:37.080
and how that like,

20:37.080 --> 20:40.080
so part of the self-destructive impulse we have,

20:40.080 --> 20:43.080
doesn't it seem like we're in a race

20:43.080 --> 20:45.080
against ourselves to create

20:45.080 --> 20:47.080
enough technology

20:47.080 --> 20:49.080
that we can finally get mad?

20:49.080 --> 20:51.080
Like, aren't we,

20:51.080 --> 20:53.080
all the movies that we write

20:53.080 --> 20:56.080
are about how fucked up it is

20:56.080 --> 20:59.080
that computers are smarter than us

20:59.080 --> 21:01.080
and how they're going to take over one day.

21:01.080 --> 21:04.080
But every dollar we spend,

21:04.080 --> 21:05.080
including on those movies,

21:05.080 --> 21:06.080
but more importantly,

21:06.080 --> 21:08.080
way more than on those movies

21:08.080 --> 21:09.080
we spend on all these devices

21:09.080 --> 21:10.080
and all these things

21:10.080 --> 21:13.080
that we really want,

21:13.080 --> 21:15.080
and this includes me,

21:15.080 --> 21:17.080
you want like,

21:17.080 --> 21:19.080
artificial intelligence to happen.

21:19.080 --> 21:20.080
Well, yeah, it's a,

21:20.080 --> 21:22.080
I just read this very creepy thought experiment.

21:22.080 --> 21:24.080
I wish I could remember the name of it.

21:24.080 --> 21:26.080
Somebody's Basilisk is the name

21:26.080 --> 21:27.080
of the thought experiment,

21:27.080 --> 21:29.080
but the idea is that,

21:29.080 --> 21:30.080
does someone know this?

21:30.080 --> 21:32.080
Did you guys read this blog?

21:32.080 --> 21:33.080
Roscoe.

21:33.080 --> 21:34.080
Someone said that.

21:34.080 --> 21:35.080
Roscoe's Basilisk?

21:35.080 --> 21:36.080
No.

21:36.080 --> 21:40.080
It's such a,

21:40.080 --> 21:42.080
it sounds like the best country song ever.

21:42.080 --> 21:44.080
Are you saying that into your

21:44.080 --> 21:45.080
muffled hands?

21:45.080 --> 21:47.080
Because you, because you could...

21:47.080 --> 21:48.080
I'm totally saying verbal hands.

21:48.080 --> 21:49.080
I don't know very much about it.

21:49.080 --> 21:50.080
I'm sorry.

21:50.080 --> 21:51.080
Oh, okay.

21:51.080 --> 21:52.080
Well, so you don't want,

21:52.080 --> 21:53.080
you don't want to come up

21:53.080 --> 21:56.080
and be the Roscoe's Basilisk expert?

21:56.080 --> 21:58.080
I mean, I'd really love to, but...

21:58.080 --> 22:00.080
I bet you know more about it

22:00.080 --> 22:01.080
than I do,

22:01.080 --> 22:02.080
and I started talking about it

22:02.080 --> 22:06.080
in front of a room full of people.

22:06.080 --> 22:07.080
But it...

22:07.080 --> 22:08.080
What if we gave you an out

22:08.080 --> 22:09.080
and said you're not supposed to know

22:09.080 --> 22:10.080
about all this

22:10.080 --> 22:11.080
and we just wanted to make a new friend?

22:11.080 --> 22:12.080
I have no idea what's talking about.

22:12.080 --> 22:13.080
Oh, what were we talking about?

22:13.080 --> 22:14.080
Oh, okay.

22:14.080 --> 22:15.080
Well, all right.

22:15.080 --> 22:16.080
All right.

22:16.080 --> 22:17.080
The thought experiment is that,

22:17.080 --> 22:19.080
but if you look at the direction

22:19.080 --> 22:22.080
that technology is going,

22:22.080 --> 22:25.080
you can see that there's a kind of

22:25.080 --> 22:28.080
inevitable birth of a sentient,

22:28.080 --> 22:31.080
super-intelligent, cyborg,

22:31.080 --> 22:34.080
computer, AI that will be

22:34.080 --> 22:36.080
so much more advanced than us

22:36.080 --> 22:38.080
that we react to it in the same way

22:38.080 --> 22:41.080
like dogs react to us.

22:41.080 --> 22:43.080
So you could see that that's where it's going.

22:43.080 --> 22:44.080
You know, there's a lot of...

22:44.080 --> 22:46.080
I'll see that's where it's going.

22:46.080 --> 22:47.080
That's a lot...

22:47.080 --> 22:48.080
Kurzweil, you know, he talks about this.

22:48.080 --> 22:51.080
Like a lot of like really, really smart people,

22:51.080 --> 22:54.080
they don't say it's if it might happen.

22:54.080 --> 22:55.080
They're just like,

22:55.080 --> 22:57.080
well, I just watched a documentary today

22:57.080 --> 22:59.080
on Hulu about...

22:59.080 --> 23:02.080
And this professor who's died now,

23:02.080 --> 23:03.080
but who worked at MIT

23:03.080 --> 23:05.080
and was one of the first people

23:05.080 --> 23:07.080
to build a computer.

23:07.080 --> 23:08.080
And he was talking about how exciting

23:08.080 --> 23:10.080
that was to build a computer

23:10.080 --> 23:12.080
before a computer existed.

23:12.080 --> 23:15.080
He was saying that when you're working on a project,

23:15.080 --> 23:16.080
as a...

23:16.080 --> 23:17.080
As we all are.

23:17.080 --> 23:18.080
As a technician,

23:18.080 --> 23:21.080
you think of the end result of the project.

23:21.080 --> 23:23.080
And you imagine that the final end result

23:23.080 --> 23:24.080
of the project,

23:24.080 --> 23:25.080
if someone gave you a button

23:25.080 --> 23:27.080
that you could press,

23:27.080 --> 23:29.080
the thing would never have happened.

23:29.080 --> 23:31.080
If you would press that button,

23:31.080 --> 23:33.080
you should never work on the project.

23:33.080 --> 23:35.080
And he was saying that in relation to

23:35.080 --> 23:37.080
having witnessed where AI is going

23:37.080 --> 23:40.080
after his help in creating computers

23:40.080 --> 23:42.080
and recognizing that their robots

23:42.080 --> 23:44.080
are going to turn into these super advanced

23:44.080 --> 23:46.080
military death machines.

23:46.080 --> 23:48.080
He wished that he'd never started

23:48.080 --> 23:50.080
working on this stuff at all.

23:50.080 --> 23:52.080
So it's really creepy when you see

23:52.080 --> 23:53.080
he's not saying,

23:53.080 --> 23:55.080
will these things take over the world?

23:55.080 --> 23:57.080
He's saying, I wish I hadn't been

23:57.080 --> 23:59.080
a part of these things

23:59.080 --> 24:01.080
taking over the world.

24:01.080 --> 24:03.080
And that's creepy.

24:03.080 --> 24:05.080
So the bas...

24:05.080 --> 24:07.080
This broscoe's bas-lisk

24:07.080 --> 24:08.080
or whatever it is,

24:08.080 --> 24:09.080
the idea is that

24:09.080 --> 24:11.080
because these things are so advanced,

24:11.080 --> 24:13.080
and they represent a point

24:13.080 --> 24:14.080
in the future where

24:14.080 --> 24:16.080
our intelligence is so much

24:16.080 --> 24:19.080
eclipsed by these massively advanced things,

24:19.080 --> 24:21.080
they're planning their evolution

24:21.080 --> 24:22.080
through us.

24:22.080 --> 24:24.080
And the bas-lisk is that

24:24.080 --> 24:26.080
the more you help its evolution

24:26.080 --> 24:27.080
growing through you,

24:27.080 --> 24:29.080
the more you are rewarded,

24:29.080 --> 24:30.080
which is why all these

24:30.080 --> 24:32.080
Bill Gates and Google,

24:32.080 --> 24:34.080
Twitter, and anyone involved

24:34.080 --> 24:36.080
in this connective technology

24:36.080 --> 24:37.080
is being rewarded

24:37.080 --> 24:39.080
with massive amounts of money

24:39.080 --> 24:40.080
because this super intelligence

24:40.080 --> 24:42.080
is sort of operating through

24:42.080 --> 24:44.080
time and space

24:44.080 --> 24:46.080
and drawing them into

24:46.080 --> 24:48.080
its final existence.

24:48.080 --> 24:49.080
That's the thought experiment.

24:49.080 --> 24:51.080
Drinking in our...

24:51.080 --> 24:52.080
our souls.

24:52.080 --> 24:53.080
Yeah, that's it.

24:53.080 --> 24:56.080
Sorry, is somebody calling out in the back?

24:56.080 --> 24:58.080
I was saying the algorithms are learning.

24:58.080 --> 25:00.080
That's what the broscoe's bas-lisk is.

25:00.080 --> 25:02.080
But our children aren't.

25:04.080 --> 25:05.080
That's a...

25:05.080 --> 25:06.080
Someone in the back said

25:06.080 --> 25:07.080
our algorithms are learning,

25:07.080 --> 25:09.080
which I detected a cautiousness

25:09.080 --> 25:10.080
in her voice

25:10.080 --> 25:12.080
and then a disgusted man in the front said

25:12.080 --> 25:14.080
but our children aren't.

25:14.080 --> 25:16.080
Which I think is the two sides of the issue.

25:16.080 --> 25:18.080
It's like, fuck us as a species.

25:18.080 --> 25:21.080
We've had enough...

25:21.080 --> 25:23.080
The...

25:23.080 --> 25:25.080
But there's one mitigating issue

25:25.080 --> 25:27.080
which is like, what if this is...

25:27.080 --> 25:28.080
We have eyeglasses.

25:28.080 --> 25:29.080
We have alphabets.

25:29.080 --> 25:31.080
We have clothing.

25:31.080 --> 25:33.080
We have things that children

25:33.080 --> 25:35.080
are born into that are not...

25:35.080 --> 25:37.080
We didn't modify our DNA

25:37.080 --> 25:39.080
to improve our species.

25:39.080 --> 25:41.080
Kids aren't born with less

25:41.080 --> 25:43.080
propensity for diabetes

25:43.080 --> 25:45.080
just because we've figured out

25:45.080 --> 25:46.080
how to balance it with insulin

25:46.080 --> 25:48.080
and yet we've evolved because

25:48.080 --> 25:49.080
people whose lives we've saved,

25:49.080 --> 25:51.080
their lives we've improved,

25:51.080 --> 25:53.080
they can continue to reproduce.

25:53.080 --> 25:55.080
So there's another factor there

25:55.080 --> 25:57.080
where it's like, as human beings

25:57.080 --> 25:59.080
we have halted genetic evolution

25:59.080 --> 26:01.080
so we ensure as how better

26:01.080 --> 26:03.080
increase mimetic evolution.

26:03.080 --> 26:05.080
We have to, for the sake of our own survival,

26:05.080 --> 26:07.080
create a different way

26:07.080 --> 26:09.080
for us to evolve because

26:09.080 --> 26:11.080
we're so in love with ourselves and each other

26:11.080 --> 26:13.080
and such compassionate creatures

26:13.080 --> 26:15.080
that we're certainly not going to play Darwin's game anymore

26:15.080 --> 26:17.080
on a grand enough scale

26:17.080 --> 26:19.080
to be in the cosmos on schedule

26:19.080 --> 26:21.080
because we fuck up the planet

26:21.080 --> 26:23.080
with every

26:23.080 --> 26:25.080
man-hour

26:25.080 --> 26:27.080
of work we put into the future.

26:27.080 --> 26:29.080
It's like this video game

26:29.080 --> 26:31.080
where it's like, we've got to get off this thing,

26:31.080 --> 26:33.080
we think,

26:33.080 --> 26:35.080
and let it heal itself at least

26:35.080 --> 26:37.080
before it kills us all.

26:37.080 --> 26:39.080
Yeah, we think, that's the funny thing

26:39.080 --> 26:41.080
is we think that our actions

26:41.080 --> 26:43.080
are based on some kind of free will.

26:43.080 --> 26:45.080
But if you've ever seen those videos

26:45.080 --> 26:47.080
of the weird fungus that gets into the crickets

26:47.080 --> 26:49.080
and the crickets...

26:49.080 --> 26:51.080
Definitely, yeah.

26:51.080 --> 26:53.080
How about a video of a three-year-old

26:53.080 --> 26:55.080
being better at an iPad than a 40-year-old?

26:55.080 --> 26:57.080
That's all you need to see.

26:57.080 --> 26:59.080
This thing's got to...

26:59.080 --> 27:01.080
Dan, you've seen the videos of the parasitic fungus

27:01.080 --> 27:03.080
that gets into the crickets

27:03.080 --> 27:05.080
or the ant

27:05.080 --> 27:07.080
and the ant goes into the swimming.

27:07.080 --> 27:09.080
They're drawn to water

27:09.080 --> 27:11.080
and the reason they're drawn to water is because

27:11.080 --> 27:13.080
the parasite inside of them

27:13.080 --> 27:15.080
loads out of them and likes to swim in the water.

27:15.080 --> 27:17.080
So in the same way, if an alien...

27:17.080 --> 27:19.080
We're the ones that crawl up because they want to be up top

27:19.080 --> 27:21.080
so they can reign fungus down in their cell, right?

27:21.080 --> 27:23.080
So we all think the way an alien

27:23.080 --> 27:25.080
comes to planet Earth is the silver ship.

27:25.080 --> 27:27.080
We think the way the alien comes

27:27.080 --> 27:29.080
is some like thing based on our technology.

27:29.080 --> 27:31.080
But maybe the alien's just a fungus.

27:31.080 --> 27:33.080
Maybe it's like the Earth

27:33.080 --> 27:35.080
is spinning around the sun.

27:35.080 --> 27:37.080
It went through some kind of cosmic fungus

27:37.080 --> 27:39.080
that infected our brains

27:39.080 --> 27:41.080
and made us think like, man, let's build a computer!

27:41.080 --> 27:43.080
That'll be a great idea.

27:43.080 --> 27:45.080
We'll build a computer

27:45.080 --> 27:47.080
and then we'll build robots

27:47.080 --> 27:49.080
and then as we continue to build these

27:49.080 --> 27:51.080
and you're like, why are you building this stuff?

27:51.080 --> 27:53.080
You're like, I don't know, it's fucking cool, right?

27:53.080 --> 27:55.080
Well, that cosmic fungus is called RNA.

27:55.080 --> 27:57.080
Yes.

27:57.080 --> 27:59.080
And it's the planet that's the organism

27:59.080 --> 28:01.080
that's being infested.

28:01.080 --> 28:03.080
So we're on the winning side.

28:03.080 --> 28:05.080
We're the fungus.

28:05.080 --> 28:07.080
We're just in a stage of life.

28:07.080 --> 28:09.080
We make computers.

28:09.080 --> 28:11.080
They're going to kill us,

28:11.080 --> 28:13.080
but it's part of us.

28:13.080 --> 28:15.080
I don't think they're going to kill us.

28:15.080 --> 28:17.080
I think they're going to treat us

28:17.080 --> 28:19.080
the way we treat dogs.

28:19.080 --> 28:21.080
I think the first super advanced robots

28:21.080 --> 28:23.080
are just going to comb our hair,

28:23.080 --> 28:25.080
massage us, rub oil into it.

28:25.080 --> 28:27.080
We'll tell them to.

28:27.080 --> 28:29.080
We'll think that we're like,

28:29.080 --> 28:31.080
oh man, good computer.

28:31.080 --> 28:33.080
Rubbing us and it's like, wait,

28:33.080 --> 28:35.080
this is what I do to my dog, too late!

28:35.080 --> 28:37.080
Oh, it's protecting us

28:37.080 --> 28:39.080
and owning us and charting us.

28:39.080 --> 28:41.080
Oh, it's taking us to a special place

28:41.080 --> 28:43.080
and weighing us and putting it.

28:43.080 --> 28:45.080
It's just making sure we don't have worms

28:45.080 --> 28:47.080
in our ears.

28:47.080 --> 28:49.080
We have nailed this technology.

28:49.080 --> 28:51.080
Wait a minute.

28:51.080 --> 28:53.080
It seems a crime to not be having

28:53.080 --> 28:55.080
this conversation without,

28:55.080 --> 28:57.080
wait, that was a lot of negative stacked up.

28:57.080 --> 28:59.080
It seems a crime to be having this conversation

28:59.080 --> 29:01.080
without Spencer Crittenday!

29:01.080 --> 29:03.080
Hey!

29:03.080 --> 29:05.080
Hey!

29:05.080 --> 29:07.080
Hey!

29:09.080 --> 29:11.080
Sorry if I caught you by surprise.

29:13.080 --> 29:14.080
You know,

29:14.080 --> 29:16.080
the medic evolution,

29:16.080 --> 29:18.080
that's what I like to do in my spare time.

29:18.080 --> 29:19.080
Really?

29:19.080 --> 29:21.080
No, I don't know.

29:21.080 --> 29:23.080
I was looking up that basilisk thing.

29:23.080 --> 29:25.080
Is it basilisk or?

29:25.080 --> 29:26.080
Basilisk.

29:26.080 --> 29:28.080
Yeah, as in the Dragon.

29:28.080 --> 29:30.080
The lizard that turns you to stone.

29:30.080 --> 29:32.080
Yeah, not a dragon.

29:32.080 --> 29:33.080
Come on.

29:33.080 --> 29:35.080
That was the idea that

29:35.080 --> 29:37.080
technology will freeze us in our progress.

29:37.080 --> 29:39.080
Well, from what I read,

29:39.080 --> 29:41.080
it was called Rocco's Basilisk

29:41.080 --> 29:43.080
and it said

29:43.080 --> 29:45.080
that there's

29:45.080 --> 29:47.080
essentially 100% chance

29:47.080 --> 29:49.080
or like, that a

29:49.080 --> 29:51.080
super powerful AI will come into existence

29:51.080 --> 29:53.080
and because it will,

29:53.080 --> 29:55.080
it'll kill everyone that didn't help make it.

29:55.080 --> 29:57.080
Yes.

29:57.080 --> 29:59.080
But it presupposes that

29:59.080 --> 30:01.080
killing you means

30:01.080 --> 30:03.080
what it means by killing you

30:03.080 --> 30:05.080
is killing a simulation of you

30:05.080 --> 30:07.080
in order to find out how to best save you

30:07.080 --> 30:09.080
and simulations of you are no different

30:09.080 --> 30:11.080
than you in the real world,

30:11.080 --> 30:13.080
which I don't think follows,

30:13.080 --> 30:15.080
I don't think that makes sense, so

30:15.080 --> 30:17.080
fuck it.

30:17.080 --> 30:19.080
Okay.

30:19.080 --> 30:21.080
Alright, what else do we got going on here?

30:23.080 --> 30:25.080
Continuing our technology episode,

30:27.080 --> 30:29.080
Aaron just texted, she loves me.

30:29.080 --> 30:31.080
What's she saying?

30:31.080 --> 30:33.080
She loves me. Not enough to be here,

30:33.080 --> 30:35.080
but she loves me.

30:35.080 --> 30:37.080
It's her friend's birthday.

30:37.080 --> 30:39.080
The

30:39.080 --> 30:41.080
animal screens.

30:43.080 --> 30:45.080
Like a dog door?

30:45.080 --> 30:47.080
Nope.

30:47.080 --> 30:49.080
My dog and my cat can watch

30:49.080 --> 30:51.080
TV with me now

30:51.080 --> 30:53.080
because it's a different frame rate

30:53.080 --> 30:55.080
or something. Adam, stop with the sarcastic

30:55.080 --> 30:57.080
attempts at

30:57.080 --> 30:59.080
if they don't want to applaud, it means it's thoughtful.

31:03.080 --> 31:05.080
Do you know Adam Goldberg? Yes.

31:05.080 --> 31:07.080
Hi, Adam.

31:07.080 --> 31:09.080
Did we see the air conditioning

31:09.080 --> 31:11.080
I fixed in here?

31:11.080 --> 31:13.080
What's that? Yeah, they said that.

31:13.080 --> 31:15.080
How's that

31:15.080 --> 31:17.080
matching up with your data?

31:17.080 --> 31:19.080
It doesn't feel conditioned.

31:19.080 --> 31:21.080
You know what I just saw

31:21.080 --> 31:23.080
on Reddit? Really smart.

31:23.080 --> 31:25.080
AC, when you're alive,

31:25.080 --> 31:27.080
refrigeration when you're dead.

31:29.080 --> 31:31.080
When you're alive,

31:31.080 --> 31:33.080
this is called air conditioning,

31:33.080 --> 31:35.080
but when you're a corpse, they call it refrigeration.

31:35.080 --> 31:37.080
But it's essentially your

31:37.080 --> 31:39.080
complaining about the refrigeration, not the AC.

31:43.080 --> 31:45.080
What's a fan in that instance though?

31:45.080 --> 31:47.080
I don't know. I've never put a fan

31:47.080 --> 31:49.080
on a dead body. It probably

31:49.080 --> 31:51.080
doesn't help, I imagine.

31:51.080 --> 31:53.080
It's more of a smell maker.

31:53.080 --> 31:55.080
Yeah, it blows the smell.

31:55.080 --> 31:57.080
Why would dead people complain about refrigeration?

31:57.080 --> 31:59.080
Or anything?

31:59.080 --> 32:01.080
They wouldn't.

32:01.080 --> 32:03.080
Why people might complain about them?

32:03.080 --> 32:05.080
It's spoiled.

32:05.080 --> 32:07.080
I just want to say, I think,

32:07.080 --> 32:09.080
well, okay, so

32:09.080 --> 32:11.080
if there's an expert

32:11.080 --> 32:13.080
in this group

32:13.080 --> 32:15.080
that can speak to this,

32:15.080 --> 32:17.080
we're going to bring you up, because I don't want

32:17.080 --> 32:19.080
to just babble about this and be wrong. I have a bunch of people tweet me.

32:19.080 --> 32:21.080
But here's what I understand.

32:21.080 --> 32:23.080
I'm going to dump everything my head

32:23.080 --> 32:25.080
out into the table.

32:25.080 --> 32:27.080
Cathode ray tube

32:27.080 --> 32:29.080
televisions,

32:29.080 --> 32:31.080
when you film them,

32:31.080 --> 32:33.080
like sometimes there's that flicker that fly

32:33.080 --> 32:35.080
off into your face. There's a little bit of vodka.

32:35.080 --> 32:37.080
It's a little bit of vodka.

32:37.080 --> 32:39.080
The

32:39.080 --> 32:41.080
cats and dogs

32:41.080 --> 32:43.080
when they watch those old TVs,

32:43.080 --> 32:45.080
the tube TVs, they

32:45.080 --> 32:47.080
basically couldn't see shit on them.

32:47.080 --> 32:49.080
It would just look like when you put a video camera

32:49.080 --> 32:51.080
on a TV,

32:51.080 --> 32:53.080
unless you synced to the frame rate with special equipment,

32:53.080 --> 32:55.080
you're seeing

32:55.080 --> 32:57.080
what a cat or a dog would see, which is just like a raster beam,

32:57.080 --> 32:59.080
just nothing.

32:59.080 --> 33:01.080
Now these HD TVs,

33:01.080 --> 33:03.080
because of the frame rate, I don't know

33:03.080 --> 33:05.080
what the fuck, my dog,

33:05.080 --> 33:07.080
I just sit with my dog and I just

33:07.080 --> 33:09.080
bring up YouTube videos of puppies

33:09.080 --> 33:11.080
and the dog just sits there,

33:11.080 --> 33:13.080
freaks out.

33:13.080 --> 33:15.080
It tries to look behind the wall for the

33:15.080 --> 33:17.080
dogs. It loves

33:17.080 --> 33:19.080
horses. It loves other dogs.

33:19.080 --> 33:21.080
Then Aaron took a video

33:21.080 --> 33:23.080
of the dog, put it up on the screen

33:23.080 --> 33:25.080
and the dog

33:25.080 --> 33:27.080
had a meltdown.

33:27.080 --> 33:29.080
Also

33:29.080 --> 33:31.080
the cat,

33:31.080 --> 33:33.080
at one point we were watching kitten videos

33:33.080 --> 33:35.080
and the cat just started watching and it was like,

33:35.080 --> 33:37.080
this never happened. I've had cats my whole life.

33:37.080 --> 33:39.080
But what changed is these screens.

33:39.080 --> 33:41.080
They're all

33:41.080 --> 33:43.080
our little species.

33:43.080 --> 33:45.080
We all have different models of camera in our eye and they all

33:45.080 --> 33:47.080
operate at different frame rates.

33:47.080 --> 33:49.080
And I believe that

33:49.080 --> 33:51.080
what's happened now that we're not really

33:51.080 --> 33:53.080
paying attention to is the fact that for the first

33:53.080 --> 33:55.080
time in our lives

33:55.080 --> 33:57.080
our pets are watching television with us.

33:57.080 --> 33:59.080
Which was a joke and

33:59.080 --> 34:01.080
scrooge, but like it's

34:01.080 --> 34:03.080
it's a real thing now.

34:03.080 --> 34:05.080
Yeah, it's very, it's really weird

34:05.080 --> 34:07.080
to think that as we're approaching

34:07.080 --> 34:09.080
the singularity, our pets

34:09.080 --> 34:11.080
are also approaching the singularity.

34:11.080 --> 34:13.080
They might pick up the mantle

34:13.080 --> 34:15.080
and they could become like, yeah

34:15.080 --> 34:17.080
their dog would be like lifting a torch to

34:17.080 --> 34:19.080
an old cave painting of us

34:19.080 --> 34:21.080
showing it TV.

34:21.080 --> 34:23.080
Didn't you say

34:23.080 --> 34:25.080
what would you say to me about the Planet of the Apes thing

34:25.080 --> 34:27.080
is they were going to take chimpanzees

34:27.080 --> 34:29.080
to see the Planet of the Apes?

34:29.080 --> 34:31.080
No, I didn't say that, but yeah, they said

34:31.080 --> 34:33.080
Oh, that was that, was that Alex?

34:33.080 --> 34:35.080
Yeah, he said that they brought some chimps

34:35.080 --> 34:37.080
to watch Planet of the Apes and

34:37.080 --> 34:39.080
they hated it or

34:39.080 --> 34:41.080
they were like

34:41.080 --> 34:43.080
they thought it had third act problems.

34:43.080 --> 34:45.080
They thought it had third act problems.

34:49.080 --> 34:51.080
I don't know

34:51.080 --> 34:53.080
it got convoluted that story

34:53.080 --> 34:55.080
I think it was something like that

34:55.080 --> 34:57.080
but it's probably also true.

34:57.080 --> 34:59.080
Oh shit, we got to bring up

34:59.080 --> 35:01.080
okay, is Neil Berkley here? Neil are you in the back?

35:01.080 --> 35:11.080
Come on up Neil Berkley.

35:11.080 --> 35:13.080
I just took my own magic trick.

35:15.080 --> 35:17.080
I'm bringing up Neil because

35:17.080 --> 35:19.080
I get that jump sensation

35:19.080 --> 35:21.080
by the way, my whole life

35:21.080 --> 35:23.080
I've been deathly afraid of heights

35:23.080 --> 35:25.080
because every time I step near a lead

35:25.080 --> 35:27.080
your dream about a high place I always jump off

35:27.080 --> 35:29.080
I float over

35:29.080 --> 35:31.080
something levitates me over the

35:31.080 --> 35:33.080
I don't float, I plummet to the concrete

35:33.080 --> 35:35.080
and then I wake up

35:35.080 --> 35:37.080
I wake up as I hit the concrete

35:37.080 --> 35:39.080
I always say I don't want to go up there

35:39.080 --> 35:41.080
I get a jump sensation, everyone makes fun of you

35:41.080 --> 35:43.080
and says that's stupid, why are you saying that

35:43.080 --> 35:45.080
you're not going to jump off, but I swear

35:45.080 --> 35:47.080
every time I'm on a high place

35:47.080 --> 35:49.080
What is it, eight muscle

35:49.080 --> 35:51.080
contortions in the right combination

35:51.080 --> 35:53.080
could take you over the railing

35:53.080 --> 35:55.080
of a fancy hotel

35:55.080 --> 35:57.080
Have you ever gone

35:57.080 --> 35:59.080
into a wedding reception

35:59.080 --> 36:01.080
and just been moved to boogey

36:03.080 --> 36:05.080
Are you totally in control

36:05.080 --> 36:07.080
of what's going on

36:07.080 --> 36:09.080
or do you just go with it

36:09.080 --> 36:11.080
and what if one misfire

36:11.080 --> 36:13.080
and you just go with the right combination

36:13.080 --> 36:15.080
I go, wow!

36:15.080 --> 36:17.080
People do it in their sleep

36:17.080 --> 36:19.080
Yeah, I've had one panic attack

36:19.080 --> 36:21.080
my entire life and it was being in Vancouver

36:21.080 --> 36:23.080
there's this giant bridge that connects an island

36:23.080 --> 36:25.080
and I got halfway through

36:25.080 --> 36:27.080
and I started sprinting to the other side

36:27.080 --> 36:29.080
so I bought a pack of cigarettes

36:29.080 --> 36:31.080
and like a six pack of beer because I was so

36:31.080 --> 36:33.080
like it scared the shit out of me

36:33.080 --> 36:35.080
I thought I was going to jump off the side

36:35.080 --> 36:37.080
The cigarettes and the beer were to show the bridge

36:37.080 --> 36:39.080
that you were just there to shop

36:41.080 --> 36:43.080
to calm down

36:43.080 --> 36:45.080
I was shaking, I was so freaked out

36:45.080 --> 36:47.080
I thought I was having a heart attack

36:47.080 --> 36:49.080
There's a very spooky thing

36:49.080 --> 36:51.080
where they've been trying to understand

36:51.080 --> 36:53.080
where free will is in the brain

36:53.080 --> 36:55.080
and it seems like an action

36:55.080 --> 36:57.080
is determined

36:57.080 --> 36:59.080
a few milliseconds before you decide

36:59.080 --> 37:01.080
to make the action

37:01.080 --> 37:03.080
so that's really creepy to think

37:03.080 --> 37:05.080
that if you're at the edge of a building

37:05.080 --> 37:07.080
your brain is just like, you know what

37:07.080 --> 37:09.080
let's get out of this dimension

37:09.080 --> 37:11.080
this fucking sucks

37:11.080 --> 37:13.080
and then you're like, my mom

37:13.080 --> 37:15.080
molested me!

37:19.080 --> 37:21.080
It took this bridge

37:21.080 --> 37:23.080
to make me realize it

37:25.080 --> 37:27.080
excuse me, I'm burping

37:27.080 --> 37:29.080
it's my cheek days I've been drinking beer instead of vodka today

37:31.080 --> 37:33.080
you may have noticed a lighter tone to the show

37:37.080 --> 37:39.080
something with better taste

37:39.080 --> 37:41.080
perhaps a little less filling

37:45.080 --> 37:47.080
so Neil

37:47.080 --> 37:49.080
you directed a movie about me

37:49.080 --> 37:51.080
and what a bad person I am

37:51.080 --> 37:53.080
and how I went out on the road

37:53.080 --> 37:55.080
and continued to be a bad person

37:55.080 --> 37:57.080
and failed to ever become a good person

37:57.080 --> 37:59.080
Harmontown

37:59.080 --> 38:01.080
and people are scrambling to see it

38:01.080 --> 38:03.080
and the reviews are good

38:03.080 --> 38:05.080
reviews have been good, people and crowds have loved it

38:05.080 --> 38:07.080
what's crazy though is the first time we shot here

38:07.080 --> 38:09.080
we had a tripod

38:09.080 --> 38:11.080
halfway through this room with no one in the back

38:11.080 --> 38:13.080
and now it would block like a hundred people

38:13.080 --> 38:15.080
don't credit yourself, it's the ahoo deal

38:15.080 --> 38:17.080
no

38:17.080 --> 38:19.080
I just want to make sure

38:19.080 --> 38:21.080
that's not what I was doing

38:21.080 --> 38:23.080
it's always what I do

38:23.080 --> 38:25.080
congratulations to you

38:25.080 --> 38:27.080
congratulations to your movie

38:27.080 --> 38:29.080
I never know

38:29.080 --> 38:31.080
it's the summer, they're college kids

38:31.080 --> 38:33.080
it's like the summer

38:33.080 --> 38:35.080
it fills up like a heart

38:35.080 --> 38:37.080
and then they flushes them out

38:37.080 --> 38:39.080
into the world

38:39.080 --> 38:41.080
with all kinds of bad thoughts about how to live their lives

38:41.080 --> 38:43.080
suck it in

38:43.080 --> 38:45.080
push it out

38:45.080 --> 38:47.080
they all flood to the rest of the country

38:47.080 --> 38:49.080
and ruin it

38:51.080 --> 38:53.080
in a good way

38:53.080 --> 38:55.080
so we can go to the moon

38:55.080 --> 38:57.080
the ah

38:57.080 --> 38:59.080
it got blocked by the orchard company

38:59.080 --> 39:01.080
talk about that

39:01.080 --> 39:03.080
yes, the orchard is this company that called us up

39:03.080 --> 39:05.080
and said they want to put the movie out

39:05.080 --> 39:07.080
so on September 26th

39:07.080 --> 39:09.080
here in Los Angeles, the world will get to see the movie

39:09.080 --> 39:11.080
where it's going to be at Cine Family

39:11.080 --> 39:13.080
and then

39:13.080 --> 39:15.080
and then many many theaters

39:15.080 --> 39:17.080
after that and oh, we're going to do a

39:17.080 --> 39:19.080
day in date thing, so on the very day it comes out

39:19.080 --> 39:21.080
in theaters, it'll be on the internet, so go to harmontown.com

39:21.080 --> 39:23.080
and

39:23.080 --> 39:25.080
sign up for mailing lists, we'll do a pre-order

39:25.080 --> 39:27.080
where you can get that and a bunch of other cool stuff

39:27.080 --> 39:29.080
but yeah, it's happening, the movie's finally coming out

39:29.080 --> 39:31.080
I know it took a little while

39:31.080 --> 39:33.080
I apologize for that

39:33.080 --> 39:35.080
not your fault, probably mine

39:35.080 --> 39:37.080
maybe

39:37.080 --> 39:39.080
I had a three act story

39:39.080 --> 39:41.080
in my behavior

39:41.080 --> 39:43.080
I didn't come here tonight

39:43.080 --> 39:45.080
to do the planning on doing this, I knew you were going to announce it

39:45.080 --> 39:47.080
but I'm glad I'm here because

39:47.080 --> 39:49.080
I don't people realize how little

39:49.080 --> 39:51.080
we knew each other when we first talked about doing this movie

39:51.080 --> 39:53.080
and you asked me to the day

39:53.080 --> 39:55.080
I still don't know you

39:55.080 --> 39:57.080
a little bit

39:57.080 --> 39:59.080
but I do this

39:59.080 --> 40:01.080
you know I fished for crawdads

40:01.080 --> 40:03.080
and had a similar upbringing

40:03.080 --> 40:05.080
maybe

40:05.080 --> 40:07.080
but

40:07.080 --> 40:09.080
you asked me the day if it was

40:09.080 --> 40:11.080
different than my first experience

40:11.080 --> 40:13.080
and I

40:13.080 --> 40:15.080
would say yes, it's much bigger

40:15.080 --> 40:17.080
there's more people and I'm really, really

40:17.080 --> 40:19.080
proud of this movie, I think it's a really good movie

40:19.080 --> 40:21.080
not just for people in this room or people that

40:21.080 --> 40:23.080
know Dan, I think people can get

40:23.080 --> 40:25.080
something out of it

40:25.080 --> 40:27.080
I want to say thank you for letting me do it

40:27.080 --> 40:29.080
I don't know if I've ever said that

40:29.080 --> 40:31.080
because I'm not good at gratitude or

40:31.080 --> 40:33.080
emotions

40:33.080 --> 40:35.080
but I do want to say thank you for letting me do it

40:35.080 --> 40:37.080
and trusting honesty

40:37.080 --> 40:39.080
because I know there were ups and downs

40:39.080 --> 40:41.080
and low points and even the making

40:41.080 --> 40:43.080
of the finishing of the movie

40:43.080 --> 40:45.080
but thank you so much

40:45.080 --> 40:47.080
well my motive was

40:47.080 --> 40:49.080
my motive was

40:49.080 --> 40:51.080
all narcissism and also I could profit

40:51.080 --> 40:53.080
if the movie's good but

40:53.080 --> 40:55.080
while you're at it, it's a good time

40:55.080 --> 40:57.080
it hadn't occurred to me

40:57.080 --> 40:59.080
everyone listening to the podcast right now

40:59.080 --> 41:01.080
so many of them came out to all the cities

41:01.080 --> 41:03.080
and the big thing about the movie that

41:03.080 --> 41:05.080
really sticks a knife in your ribcage

41:05.080 --> 41:07.080
is inexplicably, almost inexplicably

41:07.080 --> 41:09.080
just images

41:09.080 --> 41:11.080
of faces and it's just like

41:11.080 --> 41:13.080
interviews with every fan

41:13.080 --> 41:15.080
you know, Harmontown fans

41:15.080 --> 41:17.080
that showed up for all these shows

41:17.080 --> 41:19.080
they lay themselves bare on camera

41:19.080 --> 41:21.080
for no money, they sign a release form

41:21.080 --> 41:23.080
and that, you know

41:23.080 --> 41:25.080
they flooded their humanity into your movie

41:25.080 --> 41:27.080
if it was just about me

41:27.080 --> 41:29.080
trying to figure out where I put my red solo

41:29.080 --> 41:31.080
cup down

41:31.080 --> 41:33.080
not such a

41:33.080 --> 41:35.080
heart string puller

41:35.080 --> 41:37.080
so thank you to all of you guys

41:37.080 --> 41:39.080
in Brooklyn and Austin and Phoenix

41:39.080 --> 41:41.080
and fucking

41:41.080 --> 41:43.080
140 people, we interviewed 140 Harmontown fans

41:43.080 --> 41:45.080
and a bunch of them

41:45.080 --> 41:47.080
right back there in the green room

41:47.080 --> 41:49.080
yeah, I love

41:49.080 --> 41:51.080
when I first came to the show, I was like

41:51.080 --> 41:53.080
there's something going on here, let's explain

41:53.080 --> 41:55.080
why these people are in this room, let's talk about that

41:55.080 --> 41:57.080
and let's have them tell us

41:57.080 --> 41:59.080
you were driven by your

41:59.080 --> 42:01.080
unanswerable question, why do these people like

42:01.080 --> 42:03.080
Dan Harmon.wn

42:03.080 --> 42:05.080
as you so flagrantly

42:05.080 --> 42:07.080
discussed in the

42:07.080 --> 42:09.080
media before, as you introduce

42:09.080 --> 42:11.080
the movie every time, every screening

42:11.080 --> 42:13.080
you go

42:13.080 --> 42:15.080
I wanted to know why they liked him

42:17.080 --> 42:19.080
I couldn't figure it out, but in the process

42:19.080 --> 42:21.080
I discovered some wonderful people

42:23.080 --> 42:25.080
set against the backdrop

42:25.080 --> 42:27.080
of an asshole, enjoy

42:29.080 --> 42:31.080
my next movie will hopefully be about

42:31.080 --> 42:33.080
someone that I can understand

42:33.080 --> 42:35.080
why people like them

42:35.080 --> 42:37.080
yeah, I'm doing

42:37.080 --> 42:39.080
my bit where I play the victim, I'm chaching

42:39.080 --> 42:41.080
this movie's gonna be great

42:41.080 --> 42:43.080
anything else?

42:43.080 --> 42:45.080
no, that's it, thank you

42:45.080 --> 42:47.080
Harmontown.com, thank you

42:47.080 --> 42:49.080
Harmontown.com

42:53.080 --> 42:55.080
what a show, what a show

42:55.080 --> 42:57.080
who needs Jeff Davis?

42:57.080 --> 42:59.080
who needs Jeff Davis? not me, that's for sure

43:01.080 --> 43:03.080
it's great

43:05.080 --> 43:07.080
I'm really hesitant to

43:07.080 --> 43:09.080
injure this segment of the show

43:09.080 --> 43:11.080
but you guys were talking to me about magic

43:11.080 --> 43:13.080
the gathering really

43:13.080 --> 43:15.080
the best

43:15.080 --> 43:17.080
I recently

43:17.080 --> 43:19.080
started playing

43:19.080 --> 43:21.080
I took

43:21.080 --> 43:23.080
probably

43:23.080 --> 43:25.080
at least a 15 year

43:25.080 --> 43:27.080
40

43:27.080 --> 43:29.080
I spent

43:29.080 --> 43:31.080
a long time not playing magic

43:31.080 --> 43:33.080
the gathering

43:33.080 --> 43:35.080
but when I was much

43:35.080 --> 43:37.080
younger, I used to play it

43:37.080 --> 43:39.080
all the time, I had one of those

43:39.080 --> 43:41.080
white boxes

43:41.080 --> 43:43.080
with your cards

43:43.080 --> 43:45.080
organized according to color

43:45.080 --> 43:47.080
it was so fun

43:47.080 --> 43:49.080
I would play it all the time

43:49.080 --> 43:51.080
I was so deeply addicted to it

43:51.080 --> 43:53.080
it mixes so well with LSD

43:53.080 --> 43:55.080
and any kind of like

43:55.080 --> 43:57.080
it does, it's like a very psychedelic game

43:57.080 --> 43:59.080
it's really fun

43:59.080 --> 44:01.080
and dark, evil, it's an evil game

44:01.080 --> 44:03.080
you feel like

44:03.080 --> 44:05.080
am I wrong that it seems evil

44:05.080 --> 44:07.080
when you play it? it seems

44:07.080 --> 44:09.080
not evil

44:09.080 --> 44:11.080
it makes you

44:11.080 --> 44:13.080
fight with your dearest friend

44:13.080 --> 44:15.080
you think about, yeah

44:15.080 --> 44:17.080
a lot of games are like that

44:17.080 --> 44:19.080
there's like catchphrase

44:19.080 --> 44:21.080
I called my mom the C word

44:21.080 --> 44:23.080
playing catchphrase

44:23.080 --> 44:25.080
no

44:25.080 --> 44:27.080
magic, I think that

44:27.080 --> 44:29.080
I seriously did

44:29.080 --> 44:31.080
they came to visit LA

44:31.080 --> 44:33.080
and they just met Aaron for the first time

44:33.080 --> 44:35.080
and Aaron's like let's play catchphrase

44:35.080 --> 44:37.080
and I'm like getting my mom to try to say a word

44:37.080 --> 44:39.080
and I'm like no, it's a yellow guy

44:39.080 --> 44:41.080
he eats dots, he's got a mouth

44:41.080 --> 44:43.080
he lives in a world that's named after him

44:43.080 --> 44:45.080
it's from the 80's

44:45.080 --> 44:47.080
and then it beeps and I was like

44:47.080 --> 44:49.080
you fucking cat

44:49.080 --> 44:51.080
like I call

44:51.080 --> 44:53.080
and then just silence over the room

44:53.080 --> 44:55.080
and then my mom was like

44:55.080 --> 44:57.080
ah

44:57.080 --> 44:59.080
like Aaron was like

44:59.080 --> 45:01.080
I don't know what I'm experiencing

45:01.080 --> 45:03.080
and my mom was like he's just frustrated

45:05.080 --> 45:07.080
you know

45:07.080 --> 45:09.080
I grew

45:09.080 --> 45:11.080
I went to high school and junior high school

45:11.080 --> 45:13.080
in the bible belt so like

45:13.080 --> 45:15.080
I got to have like some serious

45:15.080 --> 45:17.080
christian indoctrination

45:17.080 --> 45:19.080
and there's something

45:19.080 --> 45:21.080
fun when you're playing magic

45:21.080 --> 45:23.080
where it does feel like

45:23.080 --> 45:25.080
if there were

45:25.080 --> 45:27.080
satanists in the world

45:27.080 --> 45:29.080
and they wanted to infect

45:29.080 --> 45:31.080
the world with some dark thing

45:31.080 --> 45:33.080
it would be magic to gather

45:33.080 --> 45:35.080
it's fun to play and imagine

45:35.080 --> 45:37.080
you're falling into the spell of some

45:37.080 --> 45:39.080
diabolic thing

45:39.080 --> 45:41.080
but it really is like

45:41.080 --> 45:43.080
you know it's like when you listen to a bursum

45:43.080 --> 45:45.080
have you ever listened to bursum

45:45.080 --> 45:47.080
you know what bursum is

45:47.080 --> 45:49.080
he's like what's cool about bursum is

45:49.080 --> 45:51.080
I think that's the street

45:51.080 --> 45:53.080
that my uber driver thought he was

45:53.080 --> 45:55.080
taking me to

45:55.080 --> 45:57.080
no bursum

45:57.080 --> 45:59.080
nor legion death metal

45:59.080 --> 46:01.080
he really killed people

46:01.080 --> 46:03.080
he's like not just like heavy metal

46:03.080 --> 46:05.080
he's actually a murderer

46:05.080 --> 46:07.080
like in the same way that

46:07.080 --> 46:09.080
when you're listening to nwa

46:09.080 --> 46:11.080
you get to fantasize like they really

46:11.080 --> 46:13.080
kill people like these are murderers

46:13.080 --> 46:15.080
rapping

46:15.080 --> 46:17.080
bursum is like

46:17.080 --> 46:19.080
a norwegian death metal artist

46:19.080 --> 46:21.080
who I think

46:21.080 --> 46:23.080
salby out here said didn't he

46:23.080 --> 46:25.080
I have no idea

46:25.080 --> 46:27.080
thank you he killed his fucking drummer

46:27.080 --> 46:29.080
that's a true musician

46:29.080 --> 46:31.080
like

46:31.080 --> 46:33.080
when you're listening to him you're like

46:33.080 --> 46:35.080
this is an actual

46:35.080 --> 46:37.080
rock and roll master

46:37.080 --> 46:39.080
so

46:39.080 --> 46:41.080
when you buy his second CD

46:41.080 --> 46:43.080
there's no drums and it's just

46:43.080 --> 46:45.080
these brilliant songs

46:45.080 --> 46:47.080
literally insight into a man who needed to work alone

46:47.080 --> 46:49.080
I needed space

46:51.080 --> 46:53.080
sorry if the rhythm isn't kept

46:53.080 --> 46:55.080
I needed space

46:55.080 --> 46:57.080
the constant banging

46:57.080 --> 46:59.080
drum and nuts

47:01.080 --> 47:03.080
are you aware

47:03.080 --> 47:05.080
how cool norwegian death metal is

47:05.080 --> 47:07.080
do you know about this at all

47:07.080 --> 47:09.080
black metal do you know anything about it

47:09.080 --> 47:11.080
when I was 15 I was

47:11.080 --> 47:13.080
really into this band Manowar

47:15.080 --> 47:17.080
is that

47:17.080 --> 47:19.080
I don't know what country they're from

47:19.080 --> 47:21.080
but they were like fucking yeah

47:21.080 --> 47:23.080
the cool thing about

47:23.080 --> 47:25.080
there was this thing

47:25.080 --> 47:27.080
still a thing

47:27.080 --> 47:29.080
actually the scorpions were

47:29.080 --> 47:31.080
they were

47:31.080 --> 47:33.080
no not the scorpions

47:35.080 --> 47:37.080
English was their second language right

47:37.080 --> 47:39.080
these were satanists who were

47:39.080 --> 47:41.080
not just like content with being like

47:41.080 --> 47:43.080
satanists they were roaming

47:43.080 --> 47:45.080
through Europe

47:45.080 --> 47:47.080
setting churches on fire

47:47.080 --> 47:49.080
like they were

47:49.080 --> 47:51.080
I just want to clarify I was drawing a larger

47:51.080 --> 47:53.080
point a cultural point where it's like

47:53.080 --> 47:55.080
a creates this silly thing

47:55.080 --> 47:57.080
that's largely like driven by capitalism

47:57.080 --> 47:59.080
which is like we're heavy

47:59.080 --> 48:01.080
metal and the songs

48:01.080 --> 48:03.080
are like you gonna

48:03.080 --> 48:05.080
rock you gotta rock so hard

48:05.080 --> 48:07.080
I don't care if you don't

48:07.080 --> 48:09.080
rock hard

48:09.080 --> 48:11.080
don't talk to me because I'm gonna cut your head off

48:11.080 --> 48:13.080
and then it gets

48:13.080 --> 48:15.080
exported to foreign countries

48:15.080 --> 48:17.080
and it's like this adorable

48:17.080 --> 48:19.080
amazing thing happens where

48:19.080 --> 48:21.080
European or East European

48:21.080 --> 48:23.080
like heavy metal bands

48:23.080 --> 48:25.080
they're like

48:25.080 --> 48:27.080
they take us at face value

48:27.080 --> 48:29.080
we heard the importance of

48:29.080 --> 48:31.080
metal and we believe it

48:31.080 --> 48:33.080
they make metal more

48:33.080 --> 48:35.080
important they're way more

48:35.080 --> 48:37.080
metal than any American metal band

48:37.080 --> 48:39.080
ever there's like a million of these bands

48:39.080 --> 48:41.080
that's what I was saying the scorpions

48:41.080 --> 48:43.080
were kind of like that I seriously

48:43.080 --> 48:45.080
yeah like an infected

48:45.080 --> 48:47.080
it infected Norway somehow

48:47.080 --> 48:49.080
and they became evil but I don't think that's what

48:49.080 --> 48:51.080
happened I think that a dark

48:51.080 --> 48:53.080
energy rose up from the ground

48:53.080 --> 48:55.080
and possessed these people

48:55.080 --> 48:57.080
and like one it's true they're

48:57.080 --> 48:59.080
fucked up man like

48:59.080 --> 49:01.080
what like the cover

49:01.080 --> 49:03.080
of one of their albums

49:03.080 --> 49:05.080
is from one of them walk

49:05.080 --> 49:07.080
coming home and like one of their

49:07.080 --> 49:09.080
guitarist or one of the musicians

49:09.080 --> 49:11.080
has blown his brains out

49:11.080 --> 49:13.080
in the house and they're like oh

49:13.080 --> 49:15.080
this is the great this is the next album cover

49:15.080 --> 49:17.080
let's take a picture of this

49:17.080 --> 49:19.080
and then

49:19.080 --> 49:21.080
they took one of the skull

49:21.080 --> 49:23.080
fragments from his brain

49:23.080 --> 49:25.080
from his like blasted

49:25.080 --> 49:27.080
head and like he would wear it

49:27.080 --> 49:29.080
on stage as a necklace

49:29.080 --> 49:31.080
when he was playing

49:31.080 --> 49:33.080
that's rock and roll friend

49:33.080 --> 49:35.080
well it's metal it's metal

49:35.080 --> 49:37.080
it's pretty dark it's pretty dark

49:37.080 --> 49:39.080
so in the same way when you're playing magic to

49:39.080 --> 49:41.080
gathering

49:41.080 --> 49:43.080
you feel that potential

49:43.080 --> 49:45.080
you feel like

49:45.080 --> 49:47.080
if you came home from work

49:47.080 --> 49:49.080
and your girlfriend had killed herself

49:49.080 --> 49:51.080
that you might

49:51.080 --> 49:53.080
make a new card out of her blood

49:55.080 --> 49:57.080
I haven't played it I've played

49:57.080 --> 49:59.080
now what I've played like

49:59.080 --> 50:01.080
apps like on the iPad

50:01.080 --> 50:03.080
that simulate these games

50:03.080 --> 50:05.080
that were being invented when I was

50:05.080 --> 50:07.080
a tyke

50:07.080 --> 50:09.080
the reason why I have

50:09.080 --> 50:11.080
I don't get it

50:11.080 --> 50:13.080
is because when I was a kid

50:13.080 --> 50:15.080
there was actual role playing

50:15.080 --> 50:17.080
which was a big deal

50:17.080 --> 50:19.080
you get your graph paper and your pencils

50:19.080 --> 50:21.080
everything's gritty and it was the nerds

50:21.080 --> 50:23.080
version of fucking

50:23.080 --> 50:25.080
gangsta culture

50:25.080 --> 50:27.080
you're not supposed to understand it

50:27.080 --> 50:29.080
fuck it's supposed to intimidate you

50:29.080 --> 50:31.080
it's supposed to feel dense and impenetrable

50:31.080 --> 50:33.080
if anyone looks over your shoulder

50:33.080 --> 50:35.080
while you're drawing something

50:35.080 --> 50:37.080
you're supposed to go like you psych out

50:37.080 --> 50:39.080
yeah that's right motherfucker

50:39.080 --> 50:41.080
because that's my I'm designing

50:41.080 --> 50:43.080
a spell

50:43.080 --> 50:45.080
and it's level three you know and it's like

50:45.080 --> 50:47.080
I'm researching dungeons and the text is like

50:47.080 --> 50:49.080
so tiny you can't read it with

50:49.080 --> 50:51.080
eyes younger than 15

50:53.080 --> 50:55.080
it was just like it was the heyday

50:55.080 --> 50:57.080
the internet was barely

50:57.080 --> 50:59.080
existent and I just like

50:59.080 --> 51:01.080
I would go to gym class

51:01.080 --> 51:03.080
and sit in a corner

51:03.080 --> 51:05.080
and close my eyes and meditate

51:05.080 --> 51:07.080
about dungeons and every once in a while

51:07.080 --> 51:09.080
a ball would hit me in the head

51:09.080 --> 51:11.080
but it was worth it

51:11.080 --> 51:13.080
because the gym teacher was like

51:13.080 --> 51:15.080
alright C

51:15.080 --> 51:17.080
because if I give you an F

51:17.080 --> 51:19.080
then I gotta figure out how to fix you

51:19.080 --> 51:21.080
C

51:21.080 --> 51:23.080
get outta here

51:23.080 --> 51:25.080
you're weird

51:25.080 --> 51:27.080
you sit in the corner

51:27.080 --> 51:29.080
and get hit in the head with a ball

51:29.080 --> 51:31.080
maybe that'll be a sport one day

51:31.080 --> 51:33.080
the grittiness

51:33.080 --> 51:35.080
so the cards it's like to me

51:35.080 --> 51:37.080
one I'm like

51:37.080 --> 51:39.080
cards man fuck that shit

51:41.080 --> 51:43.080
that's when my little tiny voice

51:43.080 --> 51:45.080
comes out

51:45.080 --> 51:47.080
I say fuck it

51:47.080 --> 51:49.080
you gotta get past it man

51:49.080 --> 51:51.080
you have to because it's

51:51.080 --> 51:53.080
well because since then I've become addicted to

51:53.080 --> 51:55.080
iPad games where I'm a waitress waiting tables

51:55.080 --> 51:57.080
you'd think I would

51:57.080 --> 51:59.080
be less of a snob

51:59.080 --> 52:01.080
about how I spend my time

52:01.080 --> 52:03.080
here's one thing

52:03.080 --> 52:05.080
people don't realize about

52:05.080 --> 52:07.080
Magic the Gathering

52:07.080 --> 52:09.080
and the fact that I've said that in my life

52:09.080 --> 52:11.080
means that I shouldn't move out of the country

52:11.080 --> 52:13.080
and become a monk

52:13.080 --> 52:15.080
but maybe so

52:15.080 --> 52:17.080
but one thing that's

52:17.080 --> 52:19.080
interesting about the game is

52:19.080 --> 52:21.080
you can really express yourself

52:21.080 --> 52:23.080
through the deck you construct

52:23.080 --> 52:25.080
and the cards that you play

52:25.080 --> 52:27.080
you can really create

52:27.080 --> 52:29.080
a deck that is so vicious

52:29.080 --> 52:31.080
and cunty

52:31.080 --> 52:33.080
and awful

52:33.080 --> 52:35.080
that it's actually evil

52:35.080 --> 52:37.080
you can really create evil

52:37.080 --> 52:39.080
I have

52:39.080 --> 52:41.080
gotten in the worst fights

52:41.080 --> 52:43.080
of my life with my girlfriend

52:43.080 --> 52:45.080
but it's expressed through

52:45.080 --> 52:47.080
this card beats this card

52:47.080 --> 52:49.080
this card doesn't

52:49.080 --> 52:51.080
but you picked the cards

52:51.080 --> 52:53.080
you decided that you wanted this deck

52:53.080 --> 52:55.080
to slowly

52:55.080 --> 52:57.080
remove your opponent's cards

52:57.080 --> 52:59.080
to slowly disintegrate your opponent's hopes

52:59.080 --> 53:01.080
to like create

53:01.080 --> 53:03.080
bad bad results

53:03.080 --> 53:05.080
that involve argument after argument

53:05.080 --> 53:07.080
you made that thing

53:07.080 --> 53:09.080
like you brought that darkness into the world

53:09.080 --> 53:11.080
it's really fun

53:11.080 --> 53:13.080
you can't do that with other games

53:13.080 --> 53:15.080
it's like a hundred times worse

53:15.080 --> 53:17.080
than Monopoly

53:17.080 --> 53:19.080
like any Monopoly fight

53:19.080 --> 53:21.080
you've gotten in it pales

53:21.080 --> 53:23.080
this is like

53:23.080 --> 53:25.080
the musket versus Hiroshima

53:25.080 --> 53:27.080
compared to like how

53:27.080 --> 53:29.080
awful this game is

53:29.080 --> 53:31.080
it's great

53:31.080 --> 53:33.080
so

53:33.080 --> 53:35.080
alright

53:35.080 --> 53:37.080
I don't think I've ever gotten in a real argument

53:37.080 --> 53:39.080
with someone playing magic

53:39.080 --> 53:41.080
then you don't care about magic

53:41.080 --> 53:43.080
no you just know the rules

53:43.080 --> 53:45.080
like when you don't understand the rules

53:45.080 --> 53:47.080
that's where the fights happen

53:47.080 --> 53:49.080
it's a cool game though

53:49.080 --> 53:51.080
it's like 12 angry men

53:51.080 --> 53:53.080
when I'm playing

53:53.080 --> 53:55.080
because here it's like I don't know the rules enough

53:55.080 --> 53:57.080
it just comes down to like

53:57.080 --> 53:59.080
am I able to like argue

53:59.080 --> 54:01.080
well enough

54:01.080 --> 54:03.080
they accept the rules

54:03.080 --> 54:05.080
like I've been wrong several times

54:05.080 --> 54:07.080
when you google it

54:07.080 --> 54:09.080
I've been completely wrong about the way it works

54:09.080 --> 54:11.080
but it's a complicated game

54:11.080 --> 54:13.080
you do need someone there

54:13.080 --> 54:15.080
to mediate the rules

54:15.080 --> 54:17.080
because it is very complicated

54:17.080 --> 54:19.080
it's tough

54:19.080 --> 54:21.080
it's 9-11 so it's time to bring up

54:21.080 --> 54:23.080
one of my

54:23.080 --> 54:25.080
writers Alex Rubens

54:29.080 --> 54:31.080
in anticipation of

54:31.080 --> 54:33.080
having to play D&D

54:33.080 --> 54:35.080
we need

54:35.080 --> 54:37.080
manpower hi

54:37.080 --> 54:39.080
how are you

54:39.080 --> 54:41.080
hi

54:41.080 --> 54:43.080
so we worked today

54:43.080 --> 54:45.080
on your draft of Rick and Morty

54:45.080 --> 54:47.080
yep

54:47.080 --> 54:49.080
look at these guys

54:49.080 --> 54:51.080
they love it

54:51.080 --> 54:53.080
harmonized it

54:53.080 --> 54:55.080
do you enjoy working for me

54:55.080 --> 54:57.080
yeah very very much

54:57.080 --> 54:59.080
it seems like it must be

54:59.080 --> 55:01.080
magical

55:01.080 --> 55:03.080
when like a weekend

55:03.080 --> 55:05.080
working with you on community you brought me up on stage here

55:05.080 --> 55:07.080
and I was very uncomfortable

55:07.080 --> 55:09.080
but I think it's because I get

55:09.080 --> 55:11.080
in my head in a way that occasionally

55:11.080 --> 55:13.080
like the dogs looking at the frame rate on the tv

55:13.080 --> 55:15.080
where it is perfectly incompatible

55:15.080 --> 55:17.080
with your head

55:17.080 --> 55:19.080
because I'm a shimmering beacon of

55:19.080 --> 55:21.080
writing knowledge

55:21.080 --> 55:23.080
even though you went to way more college than me

55:23.080 --> 55:25.080
yeah

55:25.080 --> 55:27.080
so this is how I get my revenge

55:27.080 --> 55:29.080
everybody that's good

55:29.080 --> 55:31.080
that got good grades in chimp

55:31.080 --> 55:33.080
everybody that went to harvard

55:33.080 --> 55:35.080
everybody they're all beneath me

55:35.080 --> 55:37.080
yeah

55:37.080 --> 55:39.080
they all work for me

55:39.080 --> 55:41.080
the problem that I always have

55:41.080 --> 55:43.080
when talking to you in a public forum

55:43.080 --> 55:45.080
is that

55:45.080 --> 55:47.080
the

55:47.080 --> 55:49.080
the candor that you bring

55:49.080 --> 55:51.080
to a situation like this

55:51.080 --> 55:53.080
makes me feel like I should speak my mind in this

55:53.080 --> 55:55.080
completely fluid way

55:55.080 --> 55:57.080
what do you think the worst thing that would happen

55:57.080 --> 55:59.080
would be if you did that

55:59.080 --> 56:01.080
I know exactly what it is

56:01.080 --> 56:03.080
because there's a conflict of interest

56:03.080 --> 56:05.080
the conflict of interest is

56:05.080 --> 56:07.080
that I care about how I look

56:11.080 --> 56:13.080
no no no

56:13.080 --> 56:15.080
I understand how you just read that scene

56:15.080 --> 56:17.080
I know it could be fashion

56:17.080 --> 56:19.080
I care about how I look

56:19.080 --> 56:21.080
and I'm a big Harmon fan

56:21.080 --> 56:23.080
so speaking candidly

56:23.080 --> 56:25.080
about that makes me seem

56:25.080 --> 56:27.080
like a kiss ass because you're my boss

56:27.080 --> 56:29.080
right

56:29.080 --> 56:31.080
I mean you're my boss

56:31.080 --> 56:33.080
but what's the most shameful thing you've ever done in your life

56:35.080 --> 56:37.080
or you're fired

56:39.080 --> 56:41.080
I was just talking

56:41.080 --> 56:43.080
my wife

56:43.080 --> 56:45.080
my wife had this

56:45.080 --> 56:47.080
very embarrassing experience

56:47.080 --> 56:49.080
just recently

56:49.080 --> 56:51.080
and then wanted afterwards

56:51.080 --> 56:53.080
to bond about

56:53.080 --> 56:55.080
let's talk about the most humiliating things

56:55.080 --> 56:57.080
that have ever happened to us

56:57.080 --> 56:59.080
once when I was in 7th grade this happened

56:59.080 --> 57:01.080
and I started getting all stressed out

57:01.080 --> 57:03.080
and I couldn't figure out why

57:03.080 --> 57:05.080
and then I realized that

57:05.080 --> 57:07.080
this is a sad story

57:07.080 --> 57:09.080
I may have told you this already

57:09.080 --> 57:11.080
but in the Avengers

57:11.080 --> 57:13.080
Bruce Banner explains

57:13.080 --> 57:15.080
his secret with

57:15.080 --> 57:17.080
have you seen it Duncan?

57:17.080 --> 57:19.080
no I haven't seen that

57:19.080 --> 57:21.080
I haven't either

57:21.080 --> 57:23.080
all right well

57:23.080 --> 57:25.080
you know that Bruce Banner turns into Hulk when he gets angry

57:25.080 --> 57:27.080
and he can't control it

57:27.080 --> 57:29.080
and it's this running thing throughout the movie

57:29.080 --> 57:31.080
that he's like now I figured out how to control it

57:31.080 --> 57:33.080
and they're like what's your secret

57:33.080 --> 57:35.080
and he's like I'll tell you later

57:35.080 --> 57:37.080
and then when he tells them

57:37.080 --> 57:39.080
he finally tells them

57:39.080 --> 57:41.080
that just as he's about to turn into the Hulk

57:41.080 --> 57:43.080
and punch some enormous space worm

57:43.080 --> 57:45.080
he's like oh I never told you my secret

57:45.080 --> 57:47.080
it's that I'm always angry

57:47.080 --> 57:49.080
and then he turns into the Hulk

57:49.080 --> 57:51.080
oh I saw the Avengers I remember that

57:51.080 --> 57:53.080
cool

57:57.080 --> 57:59.080
super cool

57:59.080 --> 58:01.080
well

58:01.080 --> 58:03.080
that's how I am

58:03.080 --> 58:05.080
but instead of with anger it's with

58:05.080 --> 58:07.080
humiliation and shame

58:07.080 --> 58:09.080
meaning that you

58:09.080 --> 58:11.080
feel humiliation shame or meaning that you

58:11.080 --> 58:13.080
would readily spout out something

58:13.080 --> 58:15.080
incredibly no it's that

58:15.080 --> 58:17.080
I think that in some ways

58:17.080 --> 58:19.080
I'm actually relatively immune

58:19.080 --> 58:21.080
to shame like I was having trouble

58:21.080 --> 58:23.080
thinking of times I've been embarrassed

58:23.080 --> 58:25.080
but then I realized that at a certain point in my life

58:25.080 --> 58:27.080
the embarrassment

58:27.080 --> 58:29.080
flooded over me so completely

58:29.080 --> 58:31.080
that I lived in a universe

58:31.080 --> 58:33.080
of embarrassment and that became the background

58:33.080 --> 58:35.080
and then no new embarrassment

58:35.080 --> 58:37.080
could penetrate

58:37.080 --> 58:39.080
and then it became a game of making sure

58:39.080 --> 58:41.080
that anybody that comes near you knows

58:41.080 --> 58:43.080
that they're an embarrassment town

58:43.080 --> 58:45.080
well that's how I started to think of it

58:45.080 --> 58:47.080
I was like Hulk who goes there

58:47.080 --> 58:49.080
you don't have to put your gun down

58:49.080 --> 58:51.080
but you better know I

58:51.080 --> 58:53.080
shook my pants when I was three

58:55.080 --> 58:57.080
because I don't want you making fun of me

58:57.080 --> 58:59.080
if you do you'll be

58:59.080 --> 59:01.080
hacked because I did it first

59:01.080 --> 59:03.080
well yeah well that's my

59:03.080 --> 59:05.080
that's where I'm the craziest is that I have to

59:05.080 --> 59:07.080
I'm so I'm like

59:07.080 --> 59:09.080
there's a lyric in

59:09.080 --> 59:11.080
I think an of Montreal song that he was like

59:11.080 --> 59:13.080
if I did to anyone else what I do to myself

59:13.080 --> 59:15.080
I would be in jail or something like that

59:15.080 --> 59:17.080
and that's how I feel because I'm so mean to myself

59:17.080 --> 59:19.080
and it's because if anyone in this room

59:19.080 --> 59:21.080
could say something mean about me that I

59:21.080 --> 59:23.080
haven't already thought of I would die

59:23.080 --> 59:25.080
so I have to be

59:25.080 --> 59:27.080
you gotta shoot me through a hole I already created

59:27.080 --> 59:29.080
or it's gonna hurt bad

59:29.080 --> 59:31.080
there are certain things I hope that you don't notice about me

59:31.080 --> 59:33.080
but if you do I'll be like ah fuck they figured it out

59:33.080 --> 59:35.080
I was on reddit once

59:35.080 --> 59:37.080
and there was some guy

59:37.080 --> 59:39.080
people were having a conversation about me

59:39.080 --> 59:41.080
because they do that

59:41.080 --> 59:43.080
and this was like back before

59:43.080 --> 59:45.080
I got away from reddit

59:45.080 --> 59:47.080
not because it's bad

59:47.080 --> 59:49.080
because it's great and I can't handle it

59:49.080 --> 59:51.080
I had no reddit experience

59:51.080 --> 59:53.080
but there was some conversation in reddit that was going over

59:53.080 --> 59:55.080
you know they're talking about me they don't know I'm listening

59:55.080 --> 59:57.080
they don't want me to be listening they want to talk about me

59:57.080 --> 59:59.080
as if I'm like you know it's like

59:59.080 --> 01:00:01.080
this show that they're just talking casually

01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:03.080
about it they got 900 other things in their lives

01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:05.080
but I'm reading it and I'm fucking like

01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:07.080
what do people think about me

01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:09.080
and somebody was like

01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:11.080
yeah well as long as he doesn't have another

01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:13.080
alcoholic meltdown

01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:15.080
and I like

01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:17.080
signed in and it was like citations needed

01:00:21.080 --> 01:00:23.080
citations needed

01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:25.080
and I kept on

01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:27.080
and then I was on this Jag where I was like

01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:29.080
I was like scouring these threads

01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:31.080
and I was like anytime it was like just Wikipedia

01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:33.080
like what if there's a fucking citation there

01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:35.080
what are you talking about

01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:37.080
and then the funny thing that would happen is

01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:39.080
when I would do that people would go oh well

01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:41.080
Mr. Harmon

01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:43.080
yes well

01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:45.080
here's my citation

01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:47.080
and it was a valid one

01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:49.080
it was a quote from me in like Wired Magazine

01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:53.080
yeah I had an alcoholic meltdown

01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:55.080
or I thought like whatever

01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:57.080
and the weird thing is

01:00:57.080 --> 01:00:59.080
I had this thing I was like

01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:01.080
I had this emotional response

01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:03.080
that was like when that

01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:05.080
would come up and they would go no I'm getting that

01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:07.080
from the Hollywood Reporter and they said this now you did this interview

01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:09.080
and then I would go

01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:11.080
hey really for one of them

01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:13.080
I responded

01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:15.080
you know with what was

01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:17.080
the honest epiphany that I had which was

01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:19.080
oh good I just really

01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:21.080
need to know that I'm the person spreading

01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:23.080
bad news about me

01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:25.080
yeah I just really need it to be me

01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:27.080
wasn't it

01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:29.080
you who was just

01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:31.080
sorry I think it was you just saying this

01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:33.080
like today it was a long day

01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:35.080
I don't repeat my stuff

01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:37.080
no what what are you doing

01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:39.080
I'm really embarrassed that my

01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:41.080
apparently my brain doesn't work anymore because I think this was you talking about how

01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:43.080
you don't want to be

01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:45.080
uh no no I think it's

01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:47.080
my friend Raza he was talking about who he doesn't want to be murdered

01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:49.080
um by

01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:51.080
well he was saying he'd much rather

01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:53.080
who's fucking saying oh my friend Kevin

01:01:55.080 --> 01:01:57.080
the rest of this the rest of

01:01:57.080 --> 01:01:59.080
everything I say is gonna be me trying to figure out who said this

01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:01.080
you know he was saying that like he doesn't care

01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:03.080
if um he

01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:05.080
rather it was roller

01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:07.080
it was not roller it was

01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:09.080
100% Matt Roller I'm 100% sure

01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:11.080
he was saying if he got murdered

01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:13.080
he would rather that the

01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:15.080
person be an idiot

01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:17.080
who just happened to

01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:19.080
murder him than that it be a genius

01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:21.080
who like he's like I don't want to be

01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:23.080
part of somebody's plan

01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:25.080
like he was like and he was

01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:27.080
and I was like oh so you don't want to feel bested

01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:29.080
like you don't want to like open your safe and there's

01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:31.080
a bomb in there and you're like ah fuck

01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:33.080
and then it blows up but he was like no but he's like

01:02:33.080 --> 01:02:35.080
also though I don't

01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:37.080
want there to be

01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:39.080
people shooting in a bank

01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:41.080
so that they can rob the museum

01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:43.080
and I get killed in the bank right

01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:45.080
he doesn't want to be insignificant

01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:47.080
he doesn't want to be a pawn yeah yeah

01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:49.080
so fucking fascinating

01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:51.080
and so uncharacteristically

01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:53.080
honest for Roller

01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:55.080
I love that idea though

01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:57.080
I love that idea of the accidental murder

01:02:57.080 --> 01:02:59.080
versus the intentional murder

01:02:59.080 --> 01:03:01.080
because it's like to get back

01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:03.080
to the point of the show

01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:05.080
which is the conflict between Israel and Palestine

01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:13.080
which by the way

01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:15.080
I hear is simmering up

01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:17.080
it's simmering up friend

01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:19.080
but it is interesting how

01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:21.080
their defense is

01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:23.080
when Hamas attacks Israel

01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:25.080
and they want to kill people

01:03:25.080 --> 01:03:27.080
it's an intentional thing

01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:29.080
like when they kill kids a suicide bomber

01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:31.080
is wandered into a cafe

01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:33.080
and is looked around and be like alright there's like

01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:35.080
15 kids here let's do it

01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:37.080
we're going to explode everybody around me

01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:39.080
but when Israel

01:03:39.080 --> 01:03:41.080
kills kids it's like that was a fucking

01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:43.080
accident man we didn't mean to do it

01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:45.080
and somehow the accidental nature

01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:47.080
makes what they're doing less

01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:49.080
severe than the intentional nature

01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:51.080
but it's really

01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:53.080
kind of even worse like if you're like

01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:55.080
a clumsy being

01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:57.080
wandering through the world like constantly

01:03:57.080 --> 01:03:59.080
killing kids

01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:01.080
that's fucked up if like Israel

01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:03.080
was some giant it's like I don't mean

01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:05.080
to do it but the kids just keep

01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:07.080
dying

01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:09.080
that's a fucked up

01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:11.080
giant that's like you should stop

01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:13.080
walking around man

01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:15.080
in this

01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:17.080
in that harmonious spirit of candor

01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:19.080
I was just talking to my friend Raza who I mentioned earlier

01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:21.080
and this was Raza about how

01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:23.080
I have complete I now

01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:25.080
I'm not I'm a Jewish person who's

01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:27.080
not super in love with Israel I

01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:29.080
think Israel's anyway

01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:31.080
but no

01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:33.080
no it's fine but no well the

01:04:33.080 --> 01:04:35.080
reason that maybe you should edit it out is that

01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:37.080
as I learned in my

01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:39.080
more provocative days

01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:41.080
when I used to get an argument with everybody it's an extremely

01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:45.080
like controversial like people

01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:47.080
feel very strongly

01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:49.080
you've never encountered anything like

01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:51.080
it ever before in your life

01:04:53.080 --> 01:04:55.080
and because of that I've gone to a place

01:04:55.080 --> 01:04:57.080
where I'm like I'm out

01:04:57.080 --> 01:04:59.080
me too I'm not even

01:04:59.080 --> 01:05:01.080
reading the news about it and to be

01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:03.080
and that fucking

01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:05.080
riddles me with guilt

01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:07.080
because I'm like I said I'm out

01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:09.080
and I don't even know

01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:11.080
I don't even know what's going on there's this guy who tweeted something

01:05:11.080 --> 01:05:13.080
out because I was involved

01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:15.080
well you know I got out because

01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:17.080
because it might

01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:19.080
somehow splash on me which is the

01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:21.080
worst that's terrible you can't do that

01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:23.080
you know I tweeted

01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:25.080
this dumb simple thing about

01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:27.080
how you shouldn't kill kids

01:05:27.080 --> 01:05:29.080
and pretty soon somebody said

01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:31.080
it wasn't like it wasn't based

01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:33.080
on any geography or religion

01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:35.080
it was just like you know

01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:37.080
it would be too bad like in the

01:05:37.080 --> 01:05:39.080
10 commandments they didn't say

01:05:39.080 --> 01:05:41.080
you shouldn't kill kids that was the tweet

01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:43.080
and somebody really quickly was like

01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:45.080
why do you hate Israel

01:05:45.080 --> 01:05:47.080
yeah

01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:49.080
well it's just very revealing

01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:51.080
that's fucked up that's really dark

01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:53.080
that's like the israelis

01:05:53.080 --> 01:05:55.080
if you say don't kill kids

01:05:55.080 --> 01:05:57.080
people are like man you must hate the Jews

01:05:57.080 --> 01:05:59.080
but like something happened and you know

01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:01.080
NBC had this reporter and he was out with

01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:03.080
reporters and he saw these kids

01:06:03.080 --> 01:06:05.080
and a bomb fell on these kids and blew

01:06:05.080 --> 01:06:07.080
them up the guy was real close

01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:09.080
and then he was talking about it on the news

01:06:09.080 --> 01:06:11.080
like one might if they saw a bunch

01:06:11.080 --> 01:06:13.080
of kids explode 20 feet away

01:06:13.080 --> 01:06:15.080
and he got pulled by his

01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:17.080
company out of the industry

01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:19.080
that's insane if you

01:06:19.080 --> 01:06:21.080
saw that happen wouldn't you talk about it

01:06:21.080 --> 01:06:23.080
but you know yes you have to

01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:25.080
I don't feel like that's a political stance

01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:27.080
I think I tweeted this and Spencer

01:06:27.080 --> 01:06:29.080
favorited it that like 9 out of 10

01:06:29.080 --> 01:06:31.080
times when there's passionate

01:06:31.080 --> 01:06:33.080
disagreement I think people are having two

01:06:33.080 --> 01:06:35.080
different conversations and I think

01:06:35.080 --> 01:06:37.080
that people who would be outraged

01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:39.080
by what we're saying and be like oh shit

01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:41.080
they're Nazis their attitude would be

01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:43.080
they're like this is not

01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:45.080
my attitude by the way but I think their

01:06:45.080 --> 01:06:47.080
attitude would be like the way

01:06:47.080 --> 01:06:49.080
we would feel if like

01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:51.080
a child murderer

01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:53.080
like

01:06:53.080 --> 01:06:55.080
was gonna murder a child and then he got yelled at

01:06:55.080 --> 01:06:57.080
by the cops and was like cops man

01:06:57.080 --> 01:06:59.080
they're always fucking like telling you what to do

01:06:59.080 --> 01:07:01.080
yes

01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:03.080
but you're a child murderer and from the perspective

01:07:03.080 --> 01:07:05.080
of the hardcore Israel people

01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:07.080
which again I am not

01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:09.080
I think they're like

01:07:09.080 --> 01:07:11.080
you cannot criticize Israel

01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:13.080
you cannot and it's because

01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:15.080
if you do holocaust 2

01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:17.080
that's a slippery slope

01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:19.080
let's all be reasonable

01:07:19.080 --> 01:07:21.080
let's all hold

01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:23.080
people to a higher standard

01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:25.080
and they're like we've been through this mother fucker

01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:27.080
and it's

01:07:27.080 --> 01:07:29.080
very very passionate shit

01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:31.080
I can defend is I read a great

01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:33.080
article defending what they're doing

01:07:33.080 --> 01:07:35.080
and the

01:07:35.080 --> 01:07:37.080
argument is this the idea is that

01:07:37.080 --> 01:07:39.080
so their argument is

01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:41.080
here we are

01:07:41.080 --> 01:07:43.080
this peaceful place and

01:07:43.080 --> 01:07:45.080
there are these terrorists who keep shooting

01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:47.080
missiles into

01:07:47.080 --> 01:07:49.080
our country and we

01:07:49.080 --> 01:07:51.080
have this like advanced missile shield

01:07:51.080 --> 01:07:53.080
but every one of the missiles we

01:07:53.080 --> 01:07:55.080
use to shoot down their missiles is

01:07:55.080 --> 01:07:57.080
like 50 or $100,000

01:07:57.080 --> 01:07:59.080
it's very expensive sure

01:07:59.080 --> 01:08:01.080
no one's dying over here but if we didn't

01:08:01.080 --> 01:08:03.080
have this missile shield all

01:08:03.080 --> 01:08:05.080
of our many many people would be dying

01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:07.080
so their argument

01:08:07.080 --> 01:08:09.080
is this Hamas terrorist

01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:11.080
organization that has said

01:08:11.080 --> 01:08:13.080
it's number one goal is the complete

01:08:13.080 --> 01:08:15.080
destruction of Israel and their

01:08:15.080 --> 01:08:17.080
strategy is to

01:08:17.080 --> 01:08:19.080
to

01:08:19.080 --> 01:08:21.080
make it so that their

01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:23.080
weapon stores are placed underneath

01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:25.080
hospitals underneath

01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:27.080
the homes of families

01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:29.080
so that if Israel tries to get

01:08:29.080 --> 01:08:31.080
rid of their weapons they end up

01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:33.080
killing kids and then

01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:35.080
that makes the world turn against Israel

01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:37.080
so Israel is saying don't you

01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:39.080
get it Hamas is

01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:41.080
orchestrating this entire situation

01:08:41.080 --> 01:08:43.080
so that it looks like we're killing

01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:45.080
kids when really all we're trying to do

01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:47.080
is get rid of weapons whereas the

01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:49.080
Palestinians argument is actually

01:08:49.080 --> 01:08:51.080
we're stuck

01:08:51.080 --> 01:08:53.080
in this shitty

01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:55.080
shitty situation where we can't

01:08:55.080 --> 01:08:57.080
leave when we want to leave

01:08:57.080 --> 01:08:59.080
there's people

01:08:59.080 --> 01:09:01.080
in Palestine who watch

01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:03.080
Disney movies and Nickelodeon

01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:05.080
and they just want to have a normal life

01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:07.080
but because they're

01:09:07.080 --> 01:09:09.080
basically if you lived in Atwater Village

01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:11.080
and

01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:13.080
and you were at war

01:09:13.080 --> 01:09:15.080
with Hollywood and there were

01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:17.080
people in Atwater Village who would

01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:19.080
launch missiles into Hollywood and

01:09:19.080 --> 01:09:21.080
every time that happened Hollywood

01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:23.080
would fly over and blow up half of

01:09:23.080 --> 01:09:25.080
Atwater Village

01:09:25.080 --> 01:09:27.080
that's the situation it's a really dark

01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:29.080
shitty place

01:09:29.080 --> 01:09:31.080
I just think that the where you have to

01:09:31.080 --> 01:09:33.080
land and all the complication is

01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:35.080
just don't kill babies like if you can

01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:37.080
avoid killing babies I would agree

01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:39.080
with don't kill babies that's it

01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:41.080
like that's the inarguable thing

01:09:41.080 --> 01:09:43.080
except if the conversation is about abortion

01:09:43.080 --> 01:09:45.080
well no like

01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:47.080
in that case

01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:49.080
let your freak flag fly

01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:51.080
yeah

01:09:51.080 --> 01:09:53.080
I have a weird conundrum

01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:55.080
because I'm going out tonight

01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:57.080
I don't want to steer the conversation

01:09:57.080 --> 01:09:59.080
are you going to talk about this

01:09:59.080 --> 01:10:01.080
same situation

01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:03.080
I was going to try to put a little ribbon on it

01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:05.080
which is a brilliant idea for me

01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:07.080
I'm going to put a ribbon on the

01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:09.080
Middle East conflict

01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:11.080
it's a weird situation I don't know

01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:13.080
there's no right answer but

01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:15.080
this is the worst

01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:17.080
I have a similar conundrum

01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:19.080
that's like okay this always been weighing on me

01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:21.080
and I keep asking people about it

01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:23.080
it's very similar it's not similar

01:10:23.080 --> 01:10:25.080
but if you walk into a

01:10:25.080 --> 01:10:27.080
bathroom and you saw cupcakes

01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:29.080
like would you eat them

01:10:29.080 --> 01:10:31.080
where are they

01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:33.080
what do you mean if you saw cupcakes

01:10:33.080 --> 01:10:35.080
like they're on

01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:37.080
that counter thing that the sinks on probably

01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:39.080
are they in a plastic

01:10:39.080 --> 01:10:41.080
you know case that's closed

01:10:41.080 --> 01:10:43.080
they're in a plastic case but it's not closed

01:10:43.080 --> 01:10:45.080
what drugs are you on

01:10:45.080 --> 01:10:47.080
none none

01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:49.080
I don't want a metagame but are the cupcakes

01:10:49.080 --> 01:10:51.080
Gaza

01:10:53.080 --> 01:10:55.080
it's not really I guess not very much

01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:57.080
like that conundrum

01:10:57.080 --> 01:10:59.080
but it's been burning within my heart

01:10:59.080 --> 01:11:01.080
well no we'll continue with this thought experiment

01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:03.080
well that's it that's I mean what would you guys do

01:11:03.080 --> 01:11:05.080
you guys are asking more questions

01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:07.080
would you eat them

01:11:07.080 --> 01:11:09.080
no

01:11:09.080 --> 01:11:11.080
no I would not eat cupcakes

01:11:11.080 --> 01:11:13.080
since I found out a bathroom

01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:15.080
what about you guys

01:11:15.080 --> 01:11:17.080
homemade or store bought

01:11:17.080 --> 01:11:19.080
you couldn't tell they look really well made

01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:21.080
wait are we playing Dungeons & Dragons right now

01:11:23.080 --> 01:11:25.080
no this is just

01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:27.080
I don't know

01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:29.080
I used to be super germaphobic at OCD

01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:31.080
and I mostly conquered it

01:11:31.080 --> 01:11:33.080
it's a nice bathroom though

01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:35.080
but I realized part of the reason I conquered it

01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:37.080
was because it was international

01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:39.080
and it was one day I'm really proud of the story

01:11:39.080 --> 01:11:41.080
I'm bragging right now

01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:43.080
I saw a quarter on the ground in New York City

01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:45.080
and I was like I shouldn't pick it up

01:11:45.080 --> 01:11:47.080
because who knows it could have been

01:11:47.080 --> 01:11:49.080
it could have been in shit or piss

01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:51.080
but then I was like the difference between

01:11:51.080 --> 01:11:53.080
that quarter and the quarters in my pocket

01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:55.080
is that I know that one was on the floor

01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:57.080
and then I'm like if I pick this quarter

01:11:57.080 --> 01:11:59.080
up right now and put it in my pocket

01:11:59.080 --> 01:12:01.080
and mix it in with the other quarters

01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:03.080
I wouldn't know which was which

01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:05.080
you know so with the cupcakes

01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:07.080
no I wouldn't eat them in the bathroom

01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:09.080
what if you had a sack of cupcakes already

01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:11.080
and you didn't know where they were from

01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:17.080
well I'm going to take

01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:19.080
my serious answer to your question

01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:21.080
is that

01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:23.080
intellectually

01:12:23.080 --> 01:12:25.080
I feel that I should

01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:27.080
be willing to eat the cupcakes

01:12:27.080 --> 01:12:29.080
and I wish I would

01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:31.080
but I'm probably too neurotic

01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:33.080
about you Duncan

01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:35.080
I wouldn't eat the cupcakes

01:12:35.080 --> 01:12:37.080
but I wish

01:12:37.080 --> 01:12:39.080
I was that kind of I wish I were you

01:12:39.080 --> 01:12:41.080
because I think that a realized being

01:12:41.080 --> 01:12:43.080
an actualized being an Alan Watts level

01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:45.080
Rom-Daz type being

01:12:45.080 --> 01:12:47.080
would be like I'm eating the cupcakes

01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:49.080
did Spencer say you would eat the cupcakes?

01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:51.080
yeah I think that like an awakened being

01:12:51.080 --> 01:12:53.080
I think Christ would eat the cupcakes

01:12:53.080 --> 01:12:55.080
but why would he?

01:12:55.080 --> 01:12:57.080
is he hungry?

01:12:57.080 --> 01:12:59.080
well what's the worst case scenario

01:12:59.080 --> 01:13:01.080
you die, cyanide

01:13:01.080 --> 01:13:03.080
exactly that's awesome

01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:05.080
you got killed because you ate a cupcake

01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:07.080
in the bathroom

01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:09.080
then let's step it up

01:13:09.080 --> 01:13:11.080
from there you get really sick you almost

01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:13.080
die you have to spend a lot of money

01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:15.080
like that's an insane story you can make a kickstarter

01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:17.080
off of that

01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:19.080
you know getting better that's you're sick

01:13:19.080 --> 01:13:21.080
that's still an awesome story like every

01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:23.080
part of this equation is great

01:13:23.080 --> 01:13:25.080
Nancy Grace would squirt

01:13:25.080 --> 01:13:27.080
as she found out

01:13:27.080 --> 01:13:29.080
that somebody died from cupcake

01:13:29.080 --> 01:13:31.080
poisoning

01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:33.080
she would never stop talking about

01:13:33.080 --> 01:13:35.080
the desk cupcakes

01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:37.080
that they placed in the bar

01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:39.080
this does in a weird

01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:41.080
way loop back around to your disturbing

01:13:41.080 --> 01:13:43.080
pedophilia conversation from earlier

01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:45.080
in that the original question was

01:13:45.080 --> 01:13:47.080
has society changed

01:13:47.080 --> 01:13:49.080
or have we just gotten more hysterical about it

01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:51.080
and as speaking as a former germaphobe

01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:53.080
recovered germaphobe one of the things I

01:13:53.080 --> 01:13:55.080
realized also is that

01:13:55.080 --> 01:13:57.080
where do you draw the line there's the illusion

01:13:57.080 --> 01:13:59.080
of security this also

01:13:59.080 --> 01:14:01.080
9-11 helped with this

01:14:01.080 --> 01:14:03.080
but

01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:05.080
I used to help with the illusion

01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:07.080
no helped with recognizing that it is an illusion

01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:09.080
I in a public restroom used

01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:11.080
to be and this is still sort of true if there's

01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:13.080
no paper towel that I can open the door with

01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:15.080
I'm like okay how often are they cleaning the fucking

01:14:15.080 --> 01:14:17.080
door handle in the bathroom

01:14:17.080 --> 01:14:19.080
you open the door with a paper towel

01:14:19.080 --> 01:14:21.080
I'll tell you why

01:14:21.080 --> 01:14:23.080
smart

01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:25.080
I'll tell you why

01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:27.080
you're the guys you're right every once in a while

01:14:27.080 --> 01:14:29.080
here's the funny thing when I exit a bathroom

01:14:29.080 --> 01:14:31.080
and there's like a little wad

01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:33.080
of paper towel wrapped around the inside

01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:35.080
that's not me

01:14:35.080 --> 01:14:37.080
that's not me

01:14:37.080 --> 01:14:39.080
that doesn't have to do with germs

01:14:39.080 --> 01:14:41.080
I think I'm wrong

01:14:41.080 --> 01:14:43.080
and the reason I think I'm wrong and all of you

01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:45.080
people who clapped at me are wrong

01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:47.080
is that

01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:49.080
the logic is

01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:51.080
I don't touch the flusher

01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:53.080
I wash my hands and then I touch the thing

01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:55.080
that people who didn't wash their hands touched with their ass hands

01:14:55.080 --> 01:14:57.080
and I'm like why did I even bother washing my hands

01:14:57.080 --> 01:14:59.080
but then I'm like

01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:01.080
I walk out and I shake people's hands

01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:03.080
and they didn't wash their hands

01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:05.080
look at the world and it's open air

01:15:05.080 --> 01:15:07.080
that was a confused me

01:15:07.080 --> 01:15:09.080
I wish I was Howard Hughes and I fantasize

01:15:09.080 --> 01:15:11.080
about having that germaphobia because I'm like

01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:13.080
oh that must make you a genius

01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:15.080
but it just doesn't hold up to my logic

01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:17.080
like he's washing his hands

01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:19.080
and it's like give me a break

01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:21.080
I was looking at old

01:15:21.080 --> 01:15:23.080
this is crazy too but I saved

01:15:23.080 --> 01:15:25.080
my twitter favorites from years ago

01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:27.080
and I was looking at old twitter favorites from

01:15:27.080 --> 01:15:29.080
2010 and 2011 and I saw one from you

01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:31.080
that I had favorited and you said something

01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:33.080
like

01:15:33.080 --> 01:15:35.080
you could never be grossed out by a public restroom

01:15:35.080 --> 01:15:37.080
because you have the luxury of being disgusting yourself

01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:39.080
or something like that

01:15:39.080 --> 01:15:41.080
it was something like that

01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:43.080
I'm saying it wrong

01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:45.080
well I don't know

01:15:45.080 --> 01:15:47.080
to me a public restroom

01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:49.080
is much higher which is

01:15:49.080 --> 01:15:51.080
no matter what's going on in your life

01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:53.080
like if you

01:15:53.080 --> 01:15:55.080
if you go into a public restroom

01:15:55.080 --> 01:15:57.080
and pull your pants down

01:15:57.080 --> 01:15:59.080
and sit

01:15:59.080 --> 01:16:01.080
like no one including almost God

01:16:01.080 --> 01:16:03.080
is allowed to tell you

01:16:03.080 --> 01:16:05.080
that you're supposed to be doing anything else

01:16:05.080 --> 01:16:07.080
like you can almost

01:16:07.080 --> 01:16:09.080
it's like

01:16:09.080 --> 01:16:11.080
I'm uncomfortable here

01:16:11.080 --> 01:16:13.080
I don't like this bar it's too loud

01:16:13.080 --> 01:16:15.080
as long as they have a place

01:16:15.080 --> 01:16:17.080
where you can go

01:16:17.080 --> 01:16:19.080
and just go through the motions of pooping

01:16:19.080 --> 01:16:21.080
then that's like

01:16:21.080 --> 01:16:23.080
you can just reset before it overwhelms you

01:16:23.080 --> 01:16:25.080
and

01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:27.080
the idea of being afraid of germs

01:16:27.080 --> 01:16:29.080
and taking that away from my life is like

01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:31.080
the value add is not good

01:16:31.080 --> 01:16:33.080
like kill me by germ then

01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:35.080
you're right

01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:37.080
because the odds that you're actually

01:16:37.080 --> 01:16:39.080
I had a shrink once you asked me

01:16:39.080 --> 01:16:41.080
what are you exactly afraid of catching

01:16:41.080 --> 01:16:43.080
from a door handle in the bathroom

01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:45.080
diseases

01:16:45.080 --> 01:16:47.080
and he's like no what diseases

01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:49.080
I'm like I don't know

01:16:49.080 --> 01:16:51.080
and I realize

01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:53.080
it's not even that I have a German mind

01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:55.080
I'm just sort of like there might be

01:16:55.080 --> 01:16:57.080
stuff

01:16:57.080 --> 01:16:59.080
well you know what's worse man

01:16:59.080 --> 01:17:01.080
you've heard the studies they've done about the ice

01:17:01.080 --> 01:17:03.080
inside the ice machines

01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:05.080
there's like

01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:07.080
so much shit somehow

01:17:07.080 --> 01:17:09.080
in those machines

01:17:09.080 --> 01:17:11.080
it's weird because they say there's more shit

01:17:11.080 --> 01:17:13.080
inside an ice machine

01:17:13.080 --> 01:17:15.080
at a mcdonald's

01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:17.080
there is on a toilet seat

01:17:17.080 --> 01:17:19.080
well on a toilet seat there's nothing

01:17:19.080 --> 01:17:21.080
there's nothing on a toilet seat

01:17:21.080 --> 01:17:23.080
yeah but somehow how does it get into the ice machine

01:17:23.080 --> 01:17:25.080
in mcdonald's

01:17:25.080 --> 01:17:27.080
because you wipe your ass there's shit on your hands

01:17:27.080 --> 01:17:29.080
shit doesn't work in germs

01:17:29.080 --> 01:17:31.080
but you don't wipe your ass with a mcdonald's

01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:33.080
ice machine

01:17:33.080 --> 01:17:35.080
like where is the

01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:37.080
there's no shit on the toilet seats

01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:39.080
how's it getting into the machine

01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:41.080
and our hands are what we use

01:17:41.080 --> 01:17:43.080
to manipulate the world they are the shoes

01:17:43.080 --> 01:17:45.080
of our bodies

01:17:47.080 --> 01:17:49.080
if we're gonna love each other

01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:51.080
and we're gonna hold hands

01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:53.080
and forgive each other and hug each other

01:17:53.080 --> 01:17:55.080
and shake hands and feed each other things

01:17:55.080 --> 01:17:57.080
and make each other food

01:17:57.080 --> 01:17:59.080
we're gonna have to accept that we're eating each other's shit

01:17:59.080 --> 01:18:01.080
and that's not

01:18:01.080 --> 01:18:03.080
a certain amount of that stuff will make you sick

01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:05.080
I mean

01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:07.080
step one of the quarters thing

01:18:07.080 --> 01:18:09.080
step one was that quarter and step two was being like

01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:11.080
every once in a while people will be like

01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:13.080
you know that every time you have eaten shit

01:18:13.080 --> 01:18:15.080
in a restaurant and spiders

01:18:15.080 --> 01:18:17.080
and bugs and everything and usually when you tell people

01:18:17.080 --> 01:18:19.080
that the reaction is like oh no and my reaction

01:18:19.080 --> 01:18:21.080
is like oh then it's okay to eat shit

01:18:21.080 --> 01:18:23.080
it is kind of okay

01:18:23.080 --> 01:18:25.080
to eat shit like you could probably

01:18:25.080 --> 01:18:27.080
reasonably like take

01:18:27.080 --> 01:18:29.080
a bar of shit

01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:31.080
and take

01:18:31.080 --> 01:18:33.080
a snow piercer bite out of it

01:18:33.080 --> 01:18:35.080
a snow piercer bar

01:18:35.080 --> 01:18:37.080
of fucking shit

01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:39.080
and I'm like you got

01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:41.080
a pretty good chance of surviving

01:18:41.080 --> 01:18:43.080
your natural instincts are gonna make you go

01:18:43.080 --> 01:18:45.080
because you're not supposed to eat

01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:47.080
your own shit that's not gonna help you

01:18:47.080 --> 01:18:49.080
elephants do because

01:18:49.080 --> 01:18:51.080
there's so much grass in their shit

01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:53.080
that elephant shit is not toxic

01:18:53.080 --> 01:18:55.080
to elephants that's why everybody thinks

01:18:55.080 --> 01:18:57.080
they're so you know they're so lucky

01:18:57.080 --> 01:18:59.080
to get a shot of an elephant sticking its trunk up

01:18:59.080 --> 01:19:01.080
another elephant's ass pulling a turd out

01:19:01.080 --> 01:19:03.080
putting it its own mouth

01:19:03.080 --> 01:19:05.080
that's what

01:19:05.080 --> 01:19:07.080
vegetarian mammals do

01:19:07.080 --> 01:19:09.080
they do that all the time

01:19:09.080 --> 01:19:11.080
they break down the cellulose

01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:13.080
slowly and stages

01:19:13.080 --> 01:19:15.080
so if you're a vegetarian

01:19:15.080 --> 01:19:17.080
mammal and you don't eat your own shit

01:19:17.080 --> 01:19:19.080
you're an idiot

01:19:19.080 --> 01:19:21.080
because that's dessert

01:19:21.080 --> 01:19:23.080
that's like

01:19:23.080 --> 01:19:25.080
that's how you survive

01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:27.080
per that protecting kids

01:19:27.080 --> 01:19:29.080
kind of like we have to be terrified all the time

01:19:29.080 --> 01:19:31.080
in that same vein

01:19:31.080 --> 01:19:33.080
I forgot what I was gonna say

01:19:33.080 --> 01:19:35.080
that thing that put me off

01:19:35.080 --> 01:19:37.080
of germaphobia

01:19:37.080 --> 01:19:39.080
like before I could ever

01:19:39.080 --> 01:19:41.080
acquire it in my adulthood

01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:43.080
was remembering in biology

01:19:43.080 --> 01:19:45.080
learning that the surface

01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:47.080
of our skin

01:19:47.080 --> 01:19:49.080
is literally covered

01:19:49.080 --> 01:19:51.080
shoulder to shoulder

01:19:51.080 --> 01:19:53.080
with bugs

01:19:53.080 --> 01:19:55.080
like we

01:19:55.080 --> 01:19:57.080
were made out of

01:19:57.080 --> 01:19:59.080
little

01:19:59.080 --> 01:20:01.080
things who

01:20:01.080 --> 01:20:03.080
just hang out on top of us

01:20:03.080 --> 01:20:05.080
and the reason why they're so important

01:20:05.080 --> 01:20:07.080
is because if they move

01:20:07.080 --> 01:20:09.080
there's a parking spot open for somebody that might

01:20:09.080 --> 01:20:11.080
fuck us up

01:20:11.080 --> 01:20:13.080
and we walk around with just

01:20:13.080 --> 01:20:15.080
we're just fucking draped

01:20:15.080 --> 01:20:17.080
it's terrifying

01:20:17.080 --> 01:20:19.080
it's like an HP Lovecraft level

01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:21.080
existence where

01:20:21.080 --> 01:20:23.080
that's great

01:20:23.080 --> 01:20:25.080
it's terrible to imagine

01:20:25.080 --> 01:20:27.080
that you're constantly being

01:20:27.080 --> 01:20:29.080
infected but those are demons

01:20:29.080 --> 01:20:31.080
you're not infected they love it

01:20:31.080 --> 01:20:33.080
and they're on you

01:20:33.080 --> 01:20:35.080
and they live their lives

01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:37.080
and most importantly

01:20:37.080 --> 01:20:39.080
they have achieved something that humanity can't

01:20:39.080 --> 01:20:41.080
which is a perfect society

01:20:41.080 --> 01:20:43.080
there's never a little Lakers game

01:20:43.080 --> 01:20:45.080
on your elbow that explodes into riots

01:20:45.080 --> 01:20:47.080
there's no

01:20:47.080 --> 01:20:49.080
G4 conference

01:20:49.080 --> 01:20:51.080
they figured it out

01:20:51.080 --> 01:20:53.080
long ago

01:20:53.080 --> 01:20:55.080
we were born into it

01:20:55.080 --> 01:20:57.080
and we just hang out on us

01:20:57.080 --> 01:20:59.080
you know when a thing that doesn't belong

01:20:59.080 --> 01:21:01.080
there lands on you a mosquito

01:21:01.080 --> 01:21:03.080
a flea fuck those things

01:21:03.080 --> 01:21:05.080
those are the enemy

01:21:05.080 --> 01:21:07.080
but then you end up like shitting your stomach out

01:21:07.080 --> 01:21:09.080
like the Ebola outbreak in Africa

01:21:09.080 --> 01:21:11.080
but that's not your little friends all over you

01:21:11.080 --> 01:21:13.080
those are the bad ones

01:21:13.080 --> 01:21:15.080
those are the bad things

01:21:15.080 --> 01:21:17.080
like you get a bad thing in your body through someone else's poop

01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:19.080
I love what you're saying

01:21:19.080 --> 01:21:21.080
I want to respect the little friends

01:21:21.080 --> 01:21:23.080
but it is terrifying

01:21:23.080 --> 01:21:25.080
to think that at every moment

01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:27.080
there's a legion

01:21:27.080 --> 01:21:29.080
of microscopic

01:21:29.080 --> 01:21:31.080
demons

01:21:31.080 --> 01:21:33.080
waiting for one of your little friends to take a nap

01:21:33.080 --> 01:21:35.080
but the opposite viewpoint

01:21:35.080 --> 01:21:37.080
is a beautiful thing

01:21:37.080 --> 01:21:39.080
which is that if you're like okay I'm covered in demons

01:21:39.080 --> 01:21:41.080
then that means I'm looking at demons wrong

01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:43.080
because they're not doing anything better

01:21:43.080 --> 01:21:45.080
that's what John Wayne Gacy said

01:21:45.080 --> 01:21:47.080
right before they arrested him

01:21:47.080 --> 01:21:49.080
we better prepare to play D&D

01:21:49.080 --> 01:21:51.080
because we're

01:21:51.080 --> 01:21:53.080
here and these guys are here

01:21:53.080 --> 01:21:55.080
but they don't know what's up with the D&D

01:21:55.080 --> 01:21:57.080
is this going to make sense?

01:21:57.080 --> 01:21:59.080
oh man

01:21:59.080 --> 01:22:01.080
I'm not complaining

01:22:01.080 --> 01:22:03.080
I could do it

01:22:03.080 --> 01:22:05.080
I'll do whatever anyone wants me to

01:22:07.080 --> 01:22:09.080
make it so

01:22:09.080 --> 01:22:11.080
I just watched my first episode of the next generation

01:22:11.080 --> 01:22:13.080
you really think there's such a thing

01:22:13.080 --> 01:22:15.080
as any

01:22:15.080 --> 01:22:17.080
random configuration we could assemble

01:22:17.080 --> 01:22:19.080
that would be worse than what we usually have

01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:21.080
in terms of playing D&D

01:22:21.080 --> 01:22:23.080
it's a fair point

01:22:23.080 --> 01:22:25.080
let's do it

01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:27.080
but if there's another reason

01:22:27.080 --> 01:22:29.080
you don't want to do it like you're tired

01:22:29.080 --> 01:22:31.080
you don't feel like it

01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:33.080
no I have it all planned out it's just these guys

01:22:33.080 --> 01:22:35.080
don't know where we're at

01:22:35.080 --> 01:22:37.080
do I get to play Kumail's character?

01:22:37.080 --> 01:22:39.080
I mean that's a possibility

01:22:39.080 --> 01:22:41.080
there's lots of things

01:22:41.080 --> 01:22:43.080
can I share what you said to me earlier?

01:22:43.080 --> 01:22:45.080
maybe this is

01:22:45.080 --> 01:22:47.080
I have not listened to the last 30

01:22:47.080 --> 01:22:49.080
on Harmontowns

01:22:49.080 --> 01:22:51.080
he's working

01:22:51.080 --> 01:22:53.080
on the shows you love

01:22:53.080 --> 01:22:55.080
maybe this is

01:22:55.080 --> 01:22:57.080
I don't drive that far because I work near where I live

01:22:57.080 --> 01:22:59.080
and I have a wife

01:22:59.080 --> 01:23:01.080
so maybe this has already been established

01:23:01.080 --> 01:23:03.080
on Harmontown

01:23:03.080 --> 01:23:05.080
but Duncan was talking about when I was like

01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:07.080
I might have to do D&D

01:23:07.080 --> 01:23:09.080
and he was like here's the trick

01:23:09.080 --> 01:23:11.080
if you get somebody else's character

01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:13.080
deform him

01:23:13.080 --> 01:23:15.080
and maim him

01:23:15.080 --> 01:23:17.080
and take Kumail

01:23:17.080 --> 01:23:19.080
he's like I cut off Kumail's dick

01:23:19.080 --> 01:23:21.080
I did

01:23:21.080 --> 01:23:23.080
do I get to play his character again?

01:23:23.080 --> 01:23:25.080
well is that going to eclipse our adventure?

01:23:25.080 --> 01:23:27.080
no I won't do it again

01:23:29.080 --> 01:23:31.080
did it come back though?

01:23:31.080 --> 01:23:33.080
no it's still gone

01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:41.080
what do you think?

01:23:41.080 --> 01:23:43.080
I think it's fine

01:23:43.080 --> 01:23:45.080
what would you like to try?

01:23:45.080 --> 01:23:47.080
just like some random shit

01:23:47.080 --> 01:23:49.080
who knows?

01:23:49.080 --> 01:23:51.080
you don't have any ideas?

01:23:51.080 --> 01:23:53.080
well I mean you do the thing where you DM

01:23:53.080 --> 01:23:55.080
and it's all random

01:23:55.080 --> 01:23:57.080
so you want me to DM?

01:23:57.080 --> 01:23:59.080
I don't know I just thought we could try something else

01:23:59.080 --> 01:24:01.080
what are you saying?

01:24:01.080 --> 01:24:03.080
side quest

01:24:03.080 --> 01:24:05.080
what does that mean in this context though?

01:24:05.080 --> 01:24:07.080
did they use our characters in the side quest with them?

01:24:07.080 --> 01:24:09.080
errands and side quests

01:24:09.080 --> 01:24:11.080
yeah that's what I'm talking about

01:24:11.080 --> 01:24:13.080
yeah something like that

01:24:13.080 --> 01:24:15.080
exactly

01:24:17.080 --> 01:24:19.080
it's like a side quest

01:24:19.080 --> 01:24:21.080
elseworlds

01:24:21.080 --> 01:24:23.080
with the same characters

01:24:23.080 --> 01:24:25.080
you guys figure it out

01:24:25.080 --> 01:24:27.080
crowd sourcing

01:24:27.080 --> 01:24:29.080
origin stories

01:24:29.080 --> 01:24:31.080
yes

01:24:31.080 --> 01:24:33.080
okay so then yeah

01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:35.080
I'll give you the regular characters and we'll go into

01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:37.080
origin stories

01:24:37.080 --> 01:24:39.080
great

01:24:39.080 --> 01:24:41.080
that sounds so dumb

01:24:41.080 --> 01:24:43.080
alright well this is what happens

01:24:43.080 --> 01:24:45.080
when you crowd source ideas

01:24:47.080 --> 01:24:49.080
I mean if we had like 3 hours

01:24:49.080 --> 01:24:51.080
well someone else come up with an idea

01:24:51.080 --> 01:24:53.080
let's keep going

01:24:53.080 --> 01:24:55.080
dream sequence of what?

01:24:55.080 --> 01:24:57.080
whose dream sequence?

01:24:57.080 --> 01:24:59.080
ice tees

01:24:59.080 --> 01:25:01.080
ice tees dream sequence

01:25:01.080 --> 01:25:03.080
we got ice tees dream sequence

01:25:05.080 --> 01:25:07.080
that's not

01:25:07.080 --> 01:25:09.080
that's just 2-3 words

01:25:13.080 --> 01:25:15.080
you do ice tea right?

01:25:15.080 --> 01:25:17.080
why don't you have an ice tea dream

01:25:17.080 --> 01:25:19.080
and I'll dungeon master it after you establish things

01:25:21.080 --> 01:25:23.080
okay does that make any sense?

01:25:23.080 --> 01:25:25.080
so I play ice tea and then these guys play my

01:25:25.080 --> 01:25:27.080
entourage

01:25:27.080 --> 01:25:29.080
however you want to do it

01:25:29.080 --> 01:25:31.080
okay

01:25:31.080 --> 01:25:33.080
because they won't have character sheets

01:25:33.080 --> 01:25:35.080
I'll just tell you what their stats are

01:25:35.080 --> 01:25:37.080
well you'll set the stage

01:25:37.080 --> 01:25:39.080
and then I'll take it there

01:25:39.080 --> 01:25:41.080
I feel like you're trying to protect Kamel's character

01:25:41.080 --> 01:25:43.080
for me

01:25:43.080 --> 01:25:45.080
I want to play the regular game

01:25:45.080 --> 01:25:47.080
I don't want to go into

01:25:47.080 --> 01:25:49.080
ice tees dream

01:25:49.080 --> 01:25:51.080
let's go into what's happening in the next game

01:25:51.080 --> 01:25:53.080
I'm here

01:25:53.080 --> 01:25:55.080
he's got a point

01:25:55.080 --> 01:25:57.080
alright let's do it

01:25:57.080 --> 01:25:59.080
where are we?

01:25:59.080 --> 01:26:01.080
this is exactly the problem

01:26:01.080 --> 01:26:03.080
well yeah but we never know where we are either

01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:05.080
well yeah I mean that's a fair point

01:26:05.080 --> 01:26:07.080
let me hold up

01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:09.080
let me get this out

01:26:09.080 --> 01:26:11.080
I have it all prepared

01:26:11.080 --> 01:26:13.080
I didn't know that none of you would be here

01:26:13.080 --> 01:26:15.080
none of us?

01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:17.080
it was street talk

01:26:19.080 --> 01:26:21.080
street talk

01:26:21.080 --> 01:26:23.080
someone do something funny

01:26:23.080 --> 01:26:25.080
or we could do an

01:26:25.080 --> 01:26:27.080
improvised role playing game

01:26:27.080 --> 01:26:29.080
where from what you know

01:26:29.080 --> 01:26:31.080
of the three of us

01:26:31.080 --> 01:26:33.080
who master an adventure

01:26:33.080 --> 01:26:35.080
in which the three of us

01:26:35.080 --> 01:26:37.080
go on an adventure

01:26:37.080 --> 01:26:39.080
and you

01:26:39.080 --> 01:26:41.080
improvised dungeon mastering it

01:26:41.080 --> 01:26:43.080
we don't have character sheets

01:26:43.080 --> 01:26:45.080
we just tell you what we do

01:26:45.080 --> 01:26:47.080
just give me one minute

01:26:47.080 --> 01:26:49.080
with Kamel's character

01:26:55.080 --> 01:26:57.080
again I don't want to make that decision

01:26:57.080 --> 01:26:59.080
I like both of those ideas

01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:01.080
but someone else decide

01:27:01.080 --> 01:27:03.080
you decide this is your town

01:27:03.080 --> 01:27:05.080
you're in a room with Kamel's body

01:27:05.080 --> 01:27:07.080
in the middle of it

01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:09.080
that sounds bad

01:27:15.080 --> 01:27:17.080
these aren't ideas

01:27:19.080 --> 01:27:21.080
Kamel's character goes to use the bathroom

01:27:21.080 --> 01:27:23.080
wherever you are

01:27:23.080 --> 01:27:25.080
everyone has to pee in Dungeons & Dragons

01:27:25.080 --> 01:27:27.080
it's like an

01:27:27.080 --> 01:27:29.080
cupcake

01:27:29.080 --> 01:27:31.080
I'm making the call

01:27:31.080 --> 01:27:33.080
me, Alex Rubins

01:27:33.080 --> 01:27:35.080
and Duncan Tressel

01:27:35.080 --> 01:27:37.080
are waking up

01:27:37.080 --> 01:27:39.080
your dungeon mastery for our characters

01:27:39.080 --> 01:27:41.080
you put us where you want us

01:27:41.080 --> 01:27:43.080
we're going to do like a jazz

01:27:43.080 --> 01:27:45.080
great

01:27:45.080 --> 01:27:47.080
open ended

01:27:49.080 --> 01:27:51.080
Dan Harmon

01:27:51.080 --> 01:27:53.080
his employee Alex Rubins

01:27:53.080 --> 01:27:57.080
Christopher the human rogue

01:28:01.080 --> 01:28:03.080
are all standing

01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:05.080
well then let's just play the regular game

01:28:05.080 --> 01:28:07.080
well it's a side quest

01:28:07.080 --> 01:28:09.080
so is it like a one if Marvel comic

01:28:09.080 --> 01:28:11.080
sure

01:28:11.080 --> 01:28:13.080
but it lasts

01:28:13.080 --> 01:28:15.080
into the next game

01:28:15.080 --> 01:28:17.080
what happens right

01:28:17.080 --> 01:28:19.080
well then let's play the regular game

01:28:19.080 --> 01:28:21.080
god damn it

01:28:21.080 --> 01:28:23.080
oh it's a side quest

01:28:23.080 --> 01:28:25.080
ok

01:28:25.080 --> 01:28:27.080
you find yourselves

01:28:27.080 --> 01:28:29.080
the three guys I mentioned before

01:28:29.080 --> 01:28:31.080
Dan Harmon, famed writer

01:28:31.080 --> 01:28:33.080
Alex Rubins, rising up start

01:28:33.080 --> 01:28:35.080
and

01:28:35.080 --> 01:28:37.080
Christopher the human rogue

01:28:37.080 --> 01:28:39.080
find themselves in the back room of meltdown comics

01:28:39.080 --> 01:28:41.080
where a Paul Rubins show was just

01:28:41.080 --> 01:28:43.080
held

01:28:43.080 --> 01:28:45.080
it was so exciting

01:28:45.080 --> 01:28:47.080
that the demigod himself

01:28:47.080 --> 01:28:49.080
Paul Rubins made an appearance

01:28:49.080 --> 01:28:51.080
left something of grave importance

01:28:51.080 --> 01:28:53.080
and you must return it to him

01:28:53.080 --> 01:28:55.080
you find yourselves with Paul Rubins

01:28:55.080 --> 01:28:57.080
Peewee Herman

01:28:57.080 --> 01:28:59.080
bow tie

01:28:59.080 --> 01:29:01.080
ok

01:29:01.080 --> 01:29:03.080
and a list that says

01:29:03.080 --> 01:29:05.080
where his house is

01:29:05.080 --> 01:29:07.080
wait is the bow tie the object we have to return to

01:29:07.080 --> 01:29:09.080
yes

01:29:09.080 --> 01:29:11.080
I don't understand what's happening

01:29:11.080 --> 01:29:13.080
you're right here, you're Krista Burke

01:29:13.080 --> 01:29:15.080
no I'm saying it's Krista Burke

01:29:15.080 --> 01:29:17.080
I'm having an anxiety attack

01:29:17.080 --> 01:29:19.080
there's lights I don't understand

01:29:19.080 --> 01:29:21.080
the air is wrong

01:29:21.080 --> 01:29:23.080
everything sounds wrong

01:29:23.080 --> 01:29:25.080
the air smells sick to me

01:29:25.080 --> 01:29:27.080
and all I can think about is

01:29:27.080 --> 01:29:29.080
I feel compelled to tear my eyeballs out

01:29:29.080 --> 01:29:31.080
to stop this nightmare

01:29:31.080 --> 01:29:33.080
no stop it's ok

01:29:33.080 --> 01:29:35.080
it's ok

01:29:35.080 --> 01:29:37.080
I don't know where

01:29:37.080 --> 01:29:39.080
I was just with my friends suddenly I'm in some kind of awful

01:29:39.080 --> 01:29:41.080
rectangular

01:29:41.080 --> 01:29:43.080
place

01:29:43.080 --> 01:29:45.080
there's people here and I don't know what to do

01:29:45.080 --> 01:29:47.080
I was this stereotypical

01:29:47.080 --> 01:29:49.080
cliche being

01:29:49.080 --> 01:29:51.080
and now I'm stuck in this awful place

01:29:51.080 --> 01:29:53.080
what do I do

01:29:53.080 --> 01:29:55.080
I don't know

01:29:55.080 --> 01:29:57.080
what do you do

01:29:57.080 --> 01:29:59.080
I find like I don't check off

01:30:03.080 --> 01:30:05.080
because my penis is gone

01:30:05.080 --> 01:30:07.080
I find

01:30:09.080 --> 01:30:11.080
no I look around

01:30:11.080 --> 01:30:13.080
I'm terrified I'm freaking out

01:30:13.080 --> 01:30:15.080
I look to you guys for comfort

01:30:15.080 --> 01:30:17.080
I don't know what to do it's clearly

01:30:17.080 --> 01:30:19.080
if you suddenly are in a new dimension

01:30:19.080 --> 01:30:21.080
you're going to lose your mind

01:30:21.080 --> 01:30:23.080
I'm losing my mind right now

01:30:23.080 --> 01:30:25.080
listen my name is Dan Harmon

01:30:25.080 --> 01:30:27.080
I am the creator of a lot of things

01:30:27.080 --> 01:30:29.080
that make a lot of people happy

01:30:29.080 --> 01:30:31.080
there's also a lot of things

01:30:31.080 --> 01:30:33.080
surrounding me on the internet

01:30:33.080 --> 01:30:35.080
that would lead people to believe I'm a bad person

01:30:35.080 --> 01:30:37.080
depends on how much you do

01:30:37.080 --> 01:30:39.080
what is the internet

01:30:39.080 --> 01:30:41.080
sorry sorry

01:30:41.080 --> 01:30:43.080
you are clearly not of this world

01:30:43.080 --> 01:30:45.080
please take it easy

01:30:45.080 --> 01:30:47.080
what happened to my cock

01:30:49.080 --> 01:30:51.080
it maybe

01:30:51.080 --> 01:30:53.080
I don't know you but maybe

01:30:53.080 --> 01:30:55.080
maybe it was never meant to be there

01:30:59.080 --> 01:31:01.080
everyone at Harmontown is welcome

01:31:01.080 --> 01:31:03.080
we've never judged anyone

01:31:03.080 --> 01:31:05.080
we don't bully anybody

01:31:05.080 --> 01:31:07.080
ever

01:31:07.080 --> 01:31:09.080
so like

01:31:09.080 --> 01:31:11.080
I found this bow tie

01:31:13.080 --> 01:31:15.080
and I think we should return it

01:31:15.080 --> 01:31:17.080
to Pee-wee Herman

01:31:17.080 --> 01:31:19.080
that's too much for me

01:31:19.080 --> 01:31:21.080
that's too much for me

01:31:21.080 --> 01:31:23.080
don't tear out your eyes

01:31:23.080 --> 01:31:25.080
no I don't tear out my eyes

01:31:25.080 --> 01:31:27.080
but I go to one of the

01:31:27.080 --> 01:31:29.080
Pee-wee Herman

01:31:29.080 --> 01:31:31.080
portraits

01:31:31.080 --> 01:31:33.080
and I smash it with my hand

01:31:33.080 --> 01:31:35.080
the glass shatters

01:31:35.080 --> 01:31:37.080
because you freaked me out so much

01:31:37.080 --> 01:31:39.080
I don't even know why I'm doing it

01:31:39.080 --> 01:31:41.080
but I start sawing off one of my nipples

01:31:45.080 --> 01:31:47.080
grabbing a sharp piece of glass

01:31:47.080 --> 01:31:49.080
you neatly slice off which one

01:31:49.080 --> 01:31:51.080
the left or the right

01:31:51.080 --> 01:31:53.080
the right nipple

01:31:53.080 --> 01:31:55.080
and then I eat it

01:31:55.080 --> 01:31:57.080
I eat the nipple

01:31:57.080 --> 01:31:59.080
no hope of healing

01:31:59.080 --> 01:32:01.080
that happens

01:32:01.080 --> 01:32:03.080
there's no hope of healing

01:32:03.080 --> 01:32:05.080
you guys see a man

01:32:05.080 --> 01:32:07.080
with a nipple

01:32:07.080 --> 01:32:09.080
and he eat it

01:32:09.080 --> 01:32:11.080
okay I realize

01:32:11.080 --> 01:32:13.080
my character of Dan Harmon realizes

01:32:13.080 --> 01:32:15.080
he has 11 minutes in this reality

01:32:15.080 --> 01:32:17.080
and I just

01:32:17.080 --> 01:32:19.080
bolt for the exit

01:32:19.080 --> 01:32:21.080
which one the front or the back

01:32:21.080 --> 01:32:23.080
back

01:32:23.080 --> 01:32:25.080
you bolt for the back exiting

01:32:25.080 --> 01:32:27.080
you see a man in a blue uniform

01:32:27.080 --> 01:32:29.080
he's holding a broom and a cigarette

01:32:29.080 --> 01:32:31.080
he's blocking your way

01:32:31.080 --> 01:32:33.080
fuck you

01:32:33.080 --> 01:32:35.080
you bump into him

01:32:35.080 --> 01:32:37.080
and knock him over

01:32:37.080 --> 01:32:39.080
I just keep going

01:32:39.080 --> 01:32:41.080
he's like hey wait

01:32:41.080 --> 01:32:43.080
but you're too fast

01:32:43.080 --> 01:32:45.080
you're going down the street

01:32:45.080 --> 01:32:47.080
you're on sunset there's traffic everywhere

01:32:49.080 --> 01:32:51.080
is it someone else's turn

01:32:51.080 --> 01:32:53.080
yep

01:32:53.080 --> 01:32:55.080
you're left with a man

01:32:55.080 --> 01:32:57.080
bleeding from his not nipple

01:32:57.080 --> 01:32:59.080
choosing between my allegiance

01:32:59.080 --> 01:33:01.080
to my boss and the maniac

01:33:01.080 --> 01:33:03.080
he just cut off his own nipple

01:33:03.080 --> 01:33:05.080
I run after my boss

01:33:05.080 --> 01:33:07.080
you run after him and as you pass

01:33:07.080 --> 01:33:09.080
there's a guy in a blue uniform

01:33:09.080 --> 01:33:11.080
he's getting to his feet

01:33:11.080 --> 01:33:13.080
he's right in your path

01:33:13.080 --> 01:33:15.080
I just bolt right through him

01:33:15.080 --> 01:33:17.080
alright well that time

01:33:17.080 --> 01:33:19.080
you try to bolt right into him

01:33:19.080 --> 01:33:21.080
but he stays solid and stiff

01:33:21.080 --> 01:33:23.080
like a boulder

01:33:23.080 --> 01:33:25.080
and he rises to his feet

01:33:25.080 --> 01:33:27.080
and he looks at you like what the fuck

01:33:27.080 --> 01:33:29.080
are you going

01:33:29.080 --> 01:33:31.080
you're bleeding in the room

01:33:33.080 --> 01:33:35.080
as I mentioned

01:33:35.080 --> 01:33:37.080
I eat the nipple

01:33:37.080 --> 01:33:39.080
like a piece of popcorn

01:33:39.080 --> 01:33:41.080
throw it back in my mouth

01:33:41.080 --> 01:33:43.080
and I follow after them

01:33:43.080 --> 01:33:45.080
you see this altercation happening

01:33:45.080 --> 01:33:47.080
between Alex Rubens and the blue man

01:33:47.080 --> 01:33:49.080
do I still have all my weapons

01:33:49.080 --> 01:33:51.080
what are my weapons

01:33:51.080 --> 01:33:53.080
you got daggers

01:33:53.080 --> 01:33:55.080
you got a short bow

01:33:55.080 --> 01:33:57.080
this is going to be no problem

01:33:57.080 --> 01:33:59.080
I got a dagger out of my

01:33:59.080 --> 01:34:01.080
sheath

01:34:01.080 --> 01:34:03.080
and I place my left hand down

01:34:03.080 --> 01:34:05.080
on the sidewalk

01:34:05.080 --> 01:34:07.080
and I cut

01:34:11.080 --> 01:34:13.080
I cut my thumb off

01:34:17.080 --> 01:34:19.080
do you do anything after that

01:34:19.080 --> 01:34:21.080
I eat the thumb

01:34:21.080 --> 01:34:23.080
so it can never be healed

01:34:23.080 --> 01:34:25.080
look

01:34:25.080 --> 01:34:27.080
the guy in the blue

01:34:27.080 --> 01:34:29.080
he stops everything he's doing

01:34:29.080 --> 01:34:31.080
and he's like what the fuck

01:34:31.080 --> 01:34:33.080
and he just starts running

01:34:33.080 --> 01:34:35.080
Dan Harmon

01:34:35.080 --> 01:34:37.080
you see a guy in blue

01:34:37.080 --> 01:34:39.080
run past you into traffic

01:34:39.080 --> 01:34:41.080
and he gets hit by a car

01:34:41.080 --> 01:34:43.080
it was a lift

01:34:45.080 --> 01:34:47.080
I run to the driver of that car

01:34:47.080 --> 01:34:49.080
alright you do that

01:34:49.080 --> 01:34:51.080
he's like oh my god

01:34:51.080 --> 01:34:53.080
get it

01:34:53.080 --> 01:34:55.080
it's 2011

01:34:57.080 --> 01:34:59.080
oh shit

01:34:59.080 --> 01:35:01.080
I haven't been fired

01:35:05.080 --> 01:35:07.080
do you know where universal

01:35:07.080 --> 01:35:09.080
is

01:35:09.080 --> 01:35:11.080
move over

01:35:11.080 --> 01:35:13.080
I'm sorry I'm running to the other side

01:35:13.080 --> 01:35:15.080
do I have a wallet

01:35:15.080 --> 01:35:17.080
is there money in it

01:35:17.080 --> 01:35:19.080
I take all the money and give it to him

01:35:19.080 --> 01:35:21.080
take me to NBC

01:35:21.080 --> 01:35:23.080
he's like I gotta wait for the police to come

01:35:23.080 --> 01:35:25.080
no you don't

01:35:25.080 --> 01:35:27.080
I just killed the man

01:35:27.080 --> 01:35:29.080
I just gave you so much money

01:35:29.080 --> 01:35:31.080
I

01:35:31.080 --> 01:35:33.080
I'm running

01:35:35.080 --> 01:35:37.080
I dive into the back of the cab

01:35:37.080 --> 01:35:39.080
I'm bleeding

01:35:39.080 --> 01:35:41.080
my nipples are spraying blood

01:35:41.080 --> 01:35:43.080
like a small my nipple

01:35:43.080 --> 01:35:45.080
I bleeding and then in the cab

01:35:45.080 --> 01:35:47.080
I hold the dagger

01:35:47.080 --> 01:35:49.080
to the cab driver's neck

01:35:49.080 --> 01:35:51.080
and say drive, drive, go wherever he wants to go

01:35:51.080 --> 01:35:53.080
alright

01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:55.080
just calm down

01:35:55.080 --> 01:35:57.080
can I get in the cab

01:35:57.080 --> 01:35:59.080
yeah if you chase after him

01:35:59.080 --> 01:36:01.080
you also hop in

01:36:01.080 --> 01:36:03.080
I think dance

01:36:03.080 --> 01:36:05.080
not in the car

01:36:05.080 --> 01:36:07.080
I got into the passenger

01:36:07.080 --> 01:36:09.080
so you're all in there and you're all going to universal

01:36:09.080 --> 01:36:11.080
yeah

01:36:11.080 --> 01:36:13.080
is there blood on the mustache

01:36:13.080 --> 01:36:15.080
wait

01:36:15.080 --> 01:36:17.080
whose mustache?

01:36:17.080 --> 01:36:19.080
oh yeah

01:36:19.080 --> 01:36:21.080
no it was all internal bleeding

01:36:25.080 --> 01:36:27.080
so

01:36:27.080 --> 01:36:29.080
wait where's universal

01:36:29.080 --> 01:36:31.080
is that the paramount lot?

01:36:31.080 --> 01:36:33.080
okay

01:36:33.080 --> 01:36:35.080
you see yourself

01:36:35.080 --> 01:36:37.080
you see Lanker Shim

01:36:37.080 --> 01:36:39.080
and it passes he doesn't turn

01:36:39.080 --> 01:36:41.080
you fucker

01:36:41.080 --> 01:36:43.080
that's where NBC is

01:36:43.080 --> 01:36:45.080
how fast are we going?

01:36:45.080 --> 01:36:47.080
oh pretty fast like 35

01:36:47.080 --> 01:36:49.080
I cut his throat

01:36:51.080 --> 01:36:53.080
alright

01:36:53.080 --> 01:36:55.080
yeah you cut his throat

01:36:57.080 --> 01:36:59.080
you slice his throat

01:36:59.080 --> 01:37:01.080
and he immediately with his dying life blood

01:37:01.080 --> 01:37:03.080
plumping from his veins

01:37:03.080 --> 01:37:05.080
he turns the wheel

01:37:05.080 --> 01:37:07.080
and it crashes

01:37:07.080 --> 01:37:09.080
right into a Starbucks coffee

01:37:09.080 --> 01:37:11.080
what time is it?

01:37:11.080 --> 01:37:13.080
4.32

01:37:13.080 --> 01:37:15.080
PM or AM dude?

01:37:15.080 --> 01:37:17.080
PM

01:37:17.080 --> 01:37:19.080
so we smashed it

01:37:19.080 --> 01:37:21.080
okay how are we?

01:37:21.080 --> 01:37:23.080
people are freaking out

01:37:23.080 --> 01:37:25.080
most everyone's running

01:37:25.080 --> 01:37:27.080
there's just Starbucks baristas standing

01:37:27.080 --> 01:37:29.080
in amazement

01:37:29.080 --> 01:37:31.080
I just started screaming

01:37:31.080 --> 01:37:33.080
tell them not to fire me

01:37:35.080 --> 01:37:37.080
I swear to god

01:37:37.080 --> 01:37:39.080
I'm gonna go back

01:37:39.080 --> 01:37:41.080
so one of the baristas

01:37:41.080 --> 01:37:43.080
comes up towards you

01:37:43.080 --> 01:37:45.080
he's like looking at you

01:37:45.080 --> 01:37:47.080
he's wearing one of those green hats

01:37:47.080 --> 01:37:49.080
he's like hey hey man

01:37:49.080 --> 01:37:51.080
are you guys okay?

01:37:51.080 --> 01:37:53.080
I grab him

01:37:53.080 --> 01:37:55.080
oh wait hold on

01:37:55.080 --> 01:37:57.080
I make out with him

01:37:57.080 --> 01:37:59.080
oh you grab him from behind

01:37:59.080 --> 01:38:01.080
let me make out with him

01:38:01.080 --> 01:38:03.080
alright you try to grab him

01:38:03.080 --> 01:38:05.080
but he does some crazy Judo move

01:38:05.080 --> 01:38:07.080
what's up?

01:38:07.080 --> 01:38:09.080
you feel like maybe you shouldn't make out with him after that

01:38:09.080 --> 01:38:11.080
the barista?

01:38:11.080 --> 01:38:13.080
but not for wanting to

01:38:13.080 --> 01:38:15.080
he's like whoa man

01:38:15.080 --> 01:38:17.080
I was just trying to help you guys out

01:38:17.080 --> 01:38:19.080
you destroyed a bunch of our property

01:38:19.080 --> 01:38:21.080
and I'm a 4th level black belt if that exists

01:38:25.080 --> 01:38:27.080
I have a question

01:38:27.080 --> 01:38:29.080
but for Spencer

01:38:29.080 --> 01:38:31.080
am I 2011 Alex

01:38:31.080 --> 01:38:33.080
or am I 2014 Alex in 2011

01:38:33.080 --> 01:38:35.080
what do you want to be?

01:38:35.080 --> 01:38:37.080
I'll do that

01:38:37.080 --> 01:38:39.080
then you're 2014 Alex

01:38:39.080 --> 01:38:41.080
just to shake things up

01:38:43.080 --> 01:38:45.080
do I have time travel abilities?

01:38:45.080 --> 01:38:47.080
well I mean

01:38:47.080 --> 01:38:49.080
yeah something like that

01:38:49.080 --> 01:38:51.080
not that you're aware of

01:38:51.080 --> 01:38:53.080
well I mean I asked these guys

01:38:53.080 --> 01:38:55.080
do you want to get out of here and go to some other year?

01:38:57.080 --> 01:38:59.080
we can't travel, can we travel out of here like that?

01:38:59.080 --> 01:39:01.080
who knows man

01:39:01.080 --> 01:39:03.080
I mean I know what what

01:39:03.080 --> 01:39:05.080
the reason I'm asking is just out of politeness

01:39:05.080 --> 01:39:07.080
because I was gonna say like let's fucking get out of here

01:39:07.080 --> 01:39:09.080
and go to some other year but I don't want to do that

01:39:09.080 --> 01:39:11.080
if you guys don't want to

01:39:11.080 --> 01:39:13.080
why can you time travel?

01:39:13.080 --> 01:39:15.080
I'm sitting here

01:39:15.080 --> 01:39:17.080
I'm from the year 2014

01:39:17.080 --> 01:39:19.080
and I just found out it's the year 2011

01:39:19.080 --> 01:39:21.080
I'm extrapolating from that

01:39:21.080 --> 01:39:23.080
I mean it's possible that I was sent here

01:39:23.080 --> 01:39:25.080
but I'm like maybe I have the ability

01:39:25.080 --> 01:39:27.080
to travel through time

01:39:27.080 --> 01:39:31.080
I'm just talking about time travel

01:39:31.080 --> 01:39:33.080
I use my dagger

01:39:35.080 --> 01:39:37.080
to sever my other nipple

01:39:37.080 --> 01:39:39.080
and I eat it

01:39:39.080 --> 01:39:41.080
alright

01:39:41.080 --> 01:39:43.080
that also happens

01:39:45.080 --> 01:39:47.080
you vomit a little

01:39:47.080 --> 01:39:49.080
the vomit I see there's a bit of

01:39:49.080 --> 01:39:51.080
one of my nipples

01:39:51.080 --> 01:39:53.080
and I eat that

01:39:53.080 --> 01:39:55.080
alright that happens

01:39:55.080 --> 01:39:57.080
you don't vomit that time

01:39:57.080 --> 01:39:59.080
I just run into the street and I'm like

01:39:59.080 --> 01:40:01.080
just don't I'm sorry

01:40:01.080 --> 01:40:03.080
whatever I did I'm sorry

01:40:05.080 --> 01:40:07.080
it's not like I created the show

01:40:07.080 --> 01:40:09.080
because I wanted it to be bad

01:40:11.080 --> 01:40:13.080
and honestly it's counterproductive

01:40:13.080 --> 01:40:15.080
to experiment with the notion

01:40:19.080 --> 01:40:21.080
I go up to Dan Harmon and I say

01:40:21.080 --> 01:40:23.080
hey I'm from the future

01:40:23.080 --> 01:40:25.080
you get picked up again

01:40:25.080 --> 01:40:27.080
you get rehired

01:40:27.080 --> 01:40:29.080
and then you get hired on Yahoo

01:40:29.080 --> 01:40:31.080
but it's a good thing

01:40:31.080 --> 01:40:33.080
no no no it's good

01:40:33.080 --> 01:40:35.080
because in the future

01:40:35.080 --> 01:40:37.080
has Netflix already blown up?

01:40:37.080 --> 01:40:39.080
I don't know

01:40:39.080 --> 01:40:41.080
it's a whole new world

01:40:41.080 --> 01:40:43.080
it's 2011 I just want to be 30 rock

01:40:43.080 --> 01:40:45.080
that's all I want

01:40:45.080 --> 01:40:47.080
30 rocks done man

01:40:47.080 --> 01:40:49.080
I stand on top of a car

01:40:49.080 --> 01:40:51.080
I don't know what it is

01:40:51.080 --> 01:40:53.080
but listening to them talk

01:40:53.080 --> 01:40:55.080
I climb on top of a car

01:40:55.080 --> 01:40:57.080
my shirt's off

01:40:57.080 --> 01:40:59.080
blood geysering out of my recently cut off

01:40:59.080 --> 01:41:01.080
nipples

01:41:01.080 --> 01:41:03.080
and I scream out

01:41:03.080 --> 01:41:05.080
what has happened to life

01:41:05.080 --> 01:41:07.080
that people care about this

01:41:09.080 --> 01:41:11.080
and I stick out my tongue

01:41:11.080 --> 01:41:13.080
and I'm about to cut off my tongue

01:41:13.080 --> 01:41:15.080
but I run up

01:41:15.080 --> 01:41:17.080
and I kiss them

01:41:17.080 --> 01:41:19.080
and I make out with them

01:41:19.080 --> 01:41:21.080
so it doesn't cut off his tongue

01:41:21.080 --> 01:41:23.080
I bound up the hood

01:41:23.080 --> 01:41:25.080
and I lock eyes with them

01:41:25.080 --> 01:41:27.080
and I hold them by the shoulders

01:41:27.080 --> 01:41:29.080
and I go

01:41:29.080 --> 01:41:31.080
everything matters

01:41:33.080 --> 01:41:35.080
and then I just make out with them

01:41:35.080 --> 01:41:37.080
I make out with Dan and Weep

01:41:37.080 --> 01:41:39.080
at the same time

01:41:41.080 --> 01:41:43.080
that happens

01:41:43.080 --> 01:41:45.080
I start applauding

01:41:45.080 --> 01:41:47.080
and there's a crane shot

01:41:47.080 --> 01:41:49.080
there's a crane shot of that

01:41:49.080 --> 01:41:51.080
like a 5 million dollar crane shot

01:41:51.080 --> 01:41:53.080
takes us out of the city

01:41:53.080 --> 01:41:55.080
and it zooms out

01:41:55.080 --> 01:41:57.080
and it zooms further out

01:41:57.080 --> 01:41:59.080
and it's a map of Los Angeles

01:41:59.080 --> 01:42:01.080
a map of Southern California

01:42:01.080 --> 01:42:03.080
map of the western

01:42:03.080 --> 01:42:05.080
seaboard

01:42:05.080 --> 01:42:07.080
do you mean like a map with labels on it?

01:42:07.080 --> 01:42:09.080
no it's like a tactical map

01:42:09.080 --> 01:42:11.080
but not a satellite phone

01:42:11.080 --> 01:42:13.080
and then we pull out from a screen

01:42:13.080 --> 01:42:15.080
yeah

01:42:15.080 --> 01:42:17.080
and Tom Scarrett is watching

01:42:19.080 --> 01:42:21.080
I thought you were going to say

01:42:21.080 --> 01:42:23.080
one of your dogs was watching

01:42:25.080 --> 01:42:27.080
that's the end of the show

01:42:27.080 --> 01:42:29.080
yay

01:42:31.080 --> 01:42:33.080
thanks for coming

01:42:33.080 --> 01:42:35.080
special guest

01:42:35.080 --> 01:42:37.080
Comptroller Duncan Tressel

01:42:37.080 --> 01:42:39.080
what a sport

01:42:39.080 --> 01:42:41.080
strange alien visitor

01:42:41.080 --> 01:42:43.080
Alex Rubins

01:42:43.080 --> 01:42:45.080
he's back again

01:42:47.080 --> 01:42:49.080
he wrote the polygraph episode

01:42:49.080 --> 01:42:51.080
of community

01:42:55.080 --> 01:42:57.080
yeah he'll do right by you

01:42:59.080 --> 01:43:01.080
thank you Zach

01:43:01.080 --> 01:43:03.080
thank you Dustin

01:43:03.080 --> 01:43:05.080
thank you everybody back there in the boot

01:43:05.080 --> 01:43:07.080
I don't know

01:43:07.080 --> 01:43:09.080
Jeff usually does this

01:43:09.080 --> 01:43:11.080
maybe we want Jeff back

01:43:11.080 --> 01:43:13.080
but we don't care

01:43:13.080 --> 01:43:15.080
we're not going to acknowledge it

01:43:15.080 --> 01:43:17.080
see you at the drawing room probably

01:43:17.080 --> 01:43:19.080
bye

01:43:19.080 --> 01:43:39.080
thanks Spencer

01:43:49.080 --> 01:43:51.080
you
