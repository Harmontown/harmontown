00:00.000 --> 00:15.000
Welcome, one and all, to San Diego, California, Comic-Con!

00:15.000 --> 00:20.000
At the Tin Ruf?

00:20.000 --> 00:23.000
I've never been to Tin Ruf, this place is all right.

00:23.000 --> 00:26.000
We're packed from floor to rasters here.

00:26.000 --> 00:42.000
Let's start off by welcoming the Game Master to the stars, Mr. Spencer Crittenden.

00:42.000 --> 00:55.000
And of course, the Mayor of Harmon Tap, the Mayor.

00:55.000 --> 01:00.000
Hi, I'm sorry, please stop the music, please stop the music, please stop the music.

01:00.000 --> 01:14.000
Hi, hello, hi everyone, don't be alarmed. There's been a slight security breach, but we want everyone to have a very good time.

01:14.000 --> 01:23.000
There's been a vulnerability in the paddock, in several paddocks, all the paddocks are very vulnerable.

01:23.000 --> 01:34.000
But if you could please just calm down, I'm slightly, there are raptors.

01:34.000 --> 01:41.000
But it's fine, just don't move, they can't see you if you don't move.

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
I thought that was T-Rex.

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
No, it's all of them.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
Holy shit, there's lots of raptors in the paddock. Are we in the paddock?

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
No, we are outside of the paddock.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
We're not in the paddock.

01:56.000 --> 02:07.000
And it looks like they're coming towards us.

02:07.000 --> 02:13.000
All right, just calm down, just please. Raptors, if you will just...

02:13.000 --> 02:19.000
Spencer, stay perfectly still. The visual acuity is based on movement.

02:19.000 --> 02:23.000
Oh thank god, he's here.

02:23.000 --> 02:28.000
Easy. Easy.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
Chris Pratt, is that you?

02:31.000 --> 02:39.000
Alpha Daisy, Beta Margaret. I only saw the movie once, but easy.

02:39.000 --> 02:44.000
They don't like to be talked to that way.

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
The mic cord is wrapped around...

02:48.000 --> 02:52.000
The mic cord's visual acuity is based on movement.

02:52.000 --> 02:58.000
Easy raptors, easy. They're good dinosaurs.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
Thank you.

02:59.000 --> 03:03.000
I know Jeff, I know you're very passionate about them being used as weapons.

03:03.000 --> 03:08.000
I feel like they must be because we're fighting a global war on terror.

03:08.000 --> 03:13.000
As long as you maintain that stance from the beginning of the movie all the way to the end...

03:13.000 --> 03:19.000
But here's my thing, with no perceivable arc whatsoever...

03:19.000 --> 03:22.000
Maybe I just have been free scenes and I just say that free time.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
I guess, but that's the middle scene.

03:24.000 --> 03:28.000
You should be like, maybe they should be something to make Sundays.

03:28.000 --> 03:33.000
I don't know, but I'm not here to talk about story structure.

03:33.000 --> 03:41.000
Go on, go on. Raptors, back to your paddock.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
Please.

03:44.000 --> 03:49.000
That was just as disorganized as that first date we went on.

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
Wait, I have a question.

03:52.000 --> 03:56.000
Is this... somebody's aunt, right?

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
In the movie, there was...

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
Yes, yes, the most...

03:58.000 --> 04:03.000
Yes, I am an aunt and it is the most important relationship you can ever have.

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
Everyone wants to spend time with their aunt, yes.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
Yes.

04:07.000 --> 04:11.000
But listen... Why wasn't it the mother in that movie? Why are the aunts in that?

04:11.000 --> 04:17.000
Because she had to be hot and it would have been weird if it was their mom.

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
Listen, I'm sorry we went on a date.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
Just thanks for not wearing shorts tonight.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
I don't know why you did whatever you did.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
You had a itinerary or that's our backstory.

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
Very organized and very career driven.

04:32.000 --> 04:36.000
Doesn't make any sense that we had backstory at all.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
Why did we go on that date? Isn't that on both of us?

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
If we went on a date, why would we see each other and go on a date

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
and why would we be mad that it didn't work out?

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
Yeah, doesn't make any sense.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
That's what dates are supposed to do.

04:48.000 --> 04:53.000
You should get mad if you marry someone on accident.

04:53.000 --> 04:57.000
You shouldn't be mad if you go on a date and someone wears cargo shorts.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
Or is too organized.

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
It would make more sense if maybe we had a one night stand

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
but it looks like we just got sandwiches.

05:05.000 --> 05:09.000
And then didn't get along and now we hate each other for some reason.

05:09.000 --> 05:15.000
But nothing gets everybody hard and wet like hunting dinosaurs.

05:15.000 --> 05:19.000
You know dinosaurs just want to do this and then that and then that.

05:19.000 --> 05:23.000
You got to know what one of those is.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
This is very disorganized for my taste.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
Dan?

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
Yes.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
Can we talk a little bit about your weapon?

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
Show me this rifle you have.

05:32.000 --> 05:38.000
I'm afraid to take it off now that I know that police can mistake a towel for a gun.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
It has the orange tip on it.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
I don't think you're going to get shot.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
A towel, Jeff.

05:45.000 --> 05:50.000
A towel has no trigger or handle or sights on it.

05:50.000 --> 05:56.000
Let's have a hand for my wife, Erin McGathy.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
It was me the whole time.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
Back to your paddock. Back to your paddock.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
She's going back to her paddock.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
Wow.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
Oh.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
In heels.

06:06.000 --> 06:10.000
She's going to run 45 miles an hour to her paddock.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
In high heels.

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
Also, you have a knife in the back too?

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
You got a little weapon behind you too?

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
This isn't a knife.

06:19.000 --> 06:24.000
This is a knife.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
Don't put it by me.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
I'm going to get shot.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
You asked me to take it off.

06:29.000 --> 06:35.000
Thank you, Diego. Welcome to the Comic Con.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
I'm getting out of this shit right away.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
I'm getting very sweaty.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
I'm 42.

06:40.000 --> 06:44.000
There's only a certain amount of time I have before my temperature becomes so unregulated

06:44.000 --> 06:48.000
that I just fall forward and crush nine people.

06:48.000 --> 06:52.000
Who would ironically be dressed as transformers?

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
Glad to thank you guys for staying.

06:54.000 --> 06:58.000
I think we were worried that we wouldn't be able to fill a venue.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
This Sunday night is usually when people go back.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
How many of you guys are from San Diego?

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
Oh.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
There's the key.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
We got a lot of San Diego fans.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
That's the key.

07:08.000 --> 07:12.000
I figured we'd be reliant on out of towners.

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
Fuck those people.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
Fuck these people.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
Thank God they're gone.

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
Fucking nerds dressed as shit.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
Look at that banana asshole.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
Fuck you, banana.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
This guy comes here every year. He's from San Jose.

07:28.000 --> 07:32.000
He's a piece of shit.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
It's that guy in all the poison ivies.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
Fuck them.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
A lot of poison ivies everywhere.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
I'm all for it.

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
The city chokes on poison ivies every year.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
I just flew in from Las Vegas.

07:45.000 --> 07:50.000
Before, from the car door to the hotel front door,

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
I saw nine Lara Crofts.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
Really?

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
I saw all the Tomb Raiders.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
Raiden Tombs.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
Some of the more interesting stuff I saw.

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
I saw Steampunk Star Wars, guys.

08:03.000 --> 08:07.000
Okay, Cricket.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
I just thought that was neat.

08:09.000 --> 08:14.000
I get cosplay this year because I think I'm getting my Comic-Con post.

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
Post-Harmontown Comic-Con vibe down.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
I really like coming here.

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
One of the things I like about it is,

08:22.000 --> 08:27.000
Comic-Con is a time when I can walk down a really crowded city street.

08:27.000 --> 08:32.000
Just every 10 minutes, someone goes,

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
Dan Harmon!

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
And it's perfectly timed every time

08:35.000 --> 08:39.000
because it's just as my self-esteem has started to crash.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
Ten more minutes.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
It's never a problem.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
It's never...

08:45.000 --> 08:49.000
I just realized if you're dressed as a banana or a stormtrooper

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
or Mario or something,

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
because I see people, they say to each other,

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
they go, Deadpool! Hey, Deadpool!

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
And then the Deadpool comes over and they get a picture with him.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
And I'm like, oh, this is what we all come here for.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
It's an opportunity to craft.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
I don't know, it's just a high you get at a people telling you...

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
Everyone should experience that.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
If we lived in a tribe of 100 people,

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
probably one one-hundredth of your day

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
would be filled with people going, hey, Kevin! Tasha!

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
You know, like, I need a shoe.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
I need a roof on my cottage.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
And biologically, we're designed for that.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
Emotionally, we're designed for...

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
Nobody makes roofs like Tasha.

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
I mean, I'm a feminist.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
I believe that's true.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
Thanks, ladies.

09:40.000 --> 09:44.000
The thanks-ladies phase of feminism may be over.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
But I'm 42.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
I think that's where I peek out.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
Thanks, ladies.

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
Hey, ladies, by applause, who's a feminist?

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
It's a ladies night for feminism.

10:01.000 --> 10:05.000
Wear your feminist bracelet and you can have blowjob shots.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
For free.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
Okay, so a couple...

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
Let's go on our lightning round,

10:11.000 --> 10:15.000
hilarious observations from Dan Sagma.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
Okay, let's do this shit.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
Yelp, yelp, yelp.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
These are little things I put in my evernote.

10:25.000 --> 10:30.000
I just wanted to say them, and that's why I wrote them down.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
Don't turn your frown upside down,

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
because it's time for observations.

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
Okay, so, you know when you're in any building,

10:43.000 --> 10:46.000
whatever, in a hotel or anything,

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
and every once in a while the three-prong electrical outlet

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
is upside down,

10:51.000 --> 10:54.000
the little hole, the little third hole

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
is on top instead of on the bottom,

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
is that a guy who did it wrong,

10:59.000 --> 11:03.000
or is that like the Jackson Pollock of electricians?

11:03.000 --> 11:07.000
Is he like, fuck, this is my fucking flourish?

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
Someone's raising their hand.

11:09.000 --> 11:14.000
This is apparently the guy that does it.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
Certified Electrician, get up here.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
Get up here!

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
It's a new segment.

11:20.000 --> 11:24.000
It's called Ask a Certified Electrician.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
We don't have a structure to this show.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
You thought this was going to be a...

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
You thought there was going to be a Seinfeld bit.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
If Seinfeld was doing this show,

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
he would have been like, fuck it.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
Grab a mic.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
What's your name, sir?

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
Logan. Take the mic out of the stand and hold it like a human being.

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
You're an electrician!

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
He's not a roadie.

11:45.000 --> 11:49.000
I'm also a union electrician, local 569 in San Diego.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
Yeah!

11:51.000 --> 11:55.000
And we all know the Death Star was non-union labor.

11:55.000 --> 11:58.000
Wait, what's not the Death Star is non-union labor?

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
That's a Kevin Smith reference.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
I guess.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
I don't know. Who knows.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
He's okay with the guy.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
Yes, that was the Kevin Smith joke.

12:08.000 --> 12:12.000
Alright, so upside down three prong outlets.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
Why?

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
The other two, one's a hot, one's a neutral.

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
And if those are actually the other way,

12:19.000 --> 12:23.000
and you happen to drop your metal piece of something,

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
and it hit those, and you're connected to it,

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
you would hurt yourself.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
That's why if it's the other way...

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
So you're a union electrician, but you call it a metal piece of something?

12:33.000 --> 12:40.000
No, let's say your metal piece of clothing,

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
or some sort of metal thing that happened to hit it,

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
or something you're reading, I don't know,

12:44.000 --> 12:48.000
but I would hit it, so that's why when it actually does hit it, you get hurt.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
So if it's the ground, which is the little point,

12:51.000 --> 12:55.000
hits it first, because it slides behind the bed or the table,

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
you're safer, because it hits the ground.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
If it hits the neutral and the hot, boom!

12:59.000 --> 13:02.000
It makes contact, not the way it should be,

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
and then you'll hurt yourself.

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
Is my brain moving slower, or is there...

13:07.000 --> 13:11.000
You're saying that makes the difference between upside down or right side up?

13:11.000 --> 13:15.000
Yes, so when you see a face that is upside down,

13:15.000 --> 13:19.000
where it's just the mouth on top, and then two eyeballs...

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
Now you're talking my language.

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
When Mr. Bill is upside down.

13:28.000 --> 13:31.000
So yeah, the first thing it would hit, if it was upside down, would be the ground.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
When you say the first thing it would hit,

13:33.000 --> 13:36.000
you mean if you're working on the wiring behind the...

13:36.000 --> 13:40.000
No, anything that might hit it, like an article of metal, or something...

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
Or like a thumbtack in the wall.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
How did you hit a hole?

13:45.000 --> 13:49.000
Let's say you're just having a wild dance party.

13:49.000 --> 13:54.000
So your plug is hanging out of the wall, such that some of the metal is visible, right?

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
And a thumbtack falls off the wall and topples into that crevice.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
Oh, if it's not all the way plugged in.

13:59.000 --> 14:02.000
Yes. Brilliant, okay.

14:02.000 --> 14:07.000
Okay, so upside down is the fucking actual Zorro way to do it.

14:07.000 --> 14:10.000
It is the code way, because it's the safest way.

14:10.000 --> 14:14.000
Oh, and all union electricians know that.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
Oh my God, thank you, electrician!

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
He's a union electrician!

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
Put him upside down, you piece of shit!

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
What was his name?

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
What was your name?

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
Logan.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
Fake name, fake name.

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
All right, so, okay, more random...

14:41.000 --> 14:45.000
We've already gotten more shit done in the harm of town than we ever have.

14:45.000 --> 14:48.000
It's San Diego, it's a port town.

14:48.000 --> 14:51.000
In LA, you're just playing to a crowd of people that are like,

14:51.000 --> 14:54.000
I hope Spielberg orders lunch soon.

14:54.000 --> 14:57.000
Or I might have a job.

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
Some of these people's parents haul fish, Jeff.

15:00.000 --> 15:04.000
All right, they skin dolphins here.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
This is a labor town.

15:07.000 --> 15:11.000
I gotta get that orca into his paddock.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
Or my children won't eat.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
All right, so there's electricians here.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
We get them from San Diego.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
Movie skeletons.

15:19.000 --> 15:23.000
I asked my chiropractor.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
He said, does your back feel better?

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
I said, I guess.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
And then I was leaving and he goes like,

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
hey, any more questions you have for me?

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
And I said, yes.

15:32.000 --> 15:35.000
In the movies, when you find a skeleton,

15:35.000 --> 15:38.000
they wouldn't stay together, would they?

15:40.000 --> 15:45.000
Like when you find a pirate and he's like holding a fucking sack of gold,

15:45.000 --> 15:48.000
and he's got a hat on and a trench coat,

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
like that's not real.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
And he's like, well, they're held together by ligaments.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
And I'm like, and they would, and he's like, they would rot.

15:53.000 --> 15:56.000
And I'm like, so goonies is a piece of shit.

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
You can't have fucking skeletons in the midst of like,

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
steering a ship.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
That shit wouldn't happen.

16:04.000 --> 16:08.000
Wait, so you're not, you don't have a problem with a skeleton being alive,

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
just that it's together?

16:10.000 --> 16:13.000
Well, I'm assuming if you're allowing for magic,

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
then you're allowing that they could just be like,

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
I don't know if brooms can fight Mickey Mouse,

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
then a skeleton can hang out, I guess.

16:19.000 --> 16:22.000
But, but when you find a skeleton,

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
on the Pirates of the Caribbean ride, when you're in Lyon,

16:25.000 --> 16:29.000
there's that pirate that's like leaning up against a wall with a sword through his chest.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
He would just be a pilot.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
Yeah, it's not like Hiroshima where it's like,

16:33.000 --> 16:38.000
oh, there was a kid throwing a ball in the air or, or like, too soon.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
They're not saying boo, they're saying goonies.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
Or, or okay, okay guys, Pompeii.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
Is that, is that cool enough?

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
All right, you guys over, Pompeii?

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
This was a rich man getting held up by a beggar,

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
like, you know, getting to see him, it's like,

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
okay, I guess the ash fell that fast.

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
But if you, unless you, if you lay down,

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
and we're like, I'm gonna die,

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
I'm gonna be a skeleton when they find me,

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
I'm gonna lay down, you'd have to lay all the way down,

17:12.000 --> 17:15.000
and then just like, make sure there was no air in the room,

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
and like, and then you slowly rot,

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
like 6,000 years later, you'd be a skeleton,

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
but the minute somebody was like,

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
look, it's a skeleton, if they touched your arm,

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
you couldn't like, lift you up like a puppet.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
Your arm would make all of the,

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
it would fall down like a house of cards.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
All right, so I'm glad I could thank you.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
We're getting so much done today.

17:33.000 --> 17:36.000
Okay, all right, screenwriters,

17:36.000 --> 17:39.000
I know there's 90 of you in the room right now,

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
because, because the software does the formatting work,

17:42.000 --> 17:45.000
so now everyone's a fucking screenwriter.

17:45.000 --> 17:50.000
Uh, I'm gonna take a page out of your, uh, script.

17:50.000 --> 17:55.000
Uh, everything happens suddenly.

17:55.000 --> 17:58.000
Dumb fucks.

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
Stop telling, everything happens suddenly.

18:01.000 --> 18:06.000
If a car explodes gradually, let me know.

18:06.000 --> 18:09.000
Otherwise, I imagine it suddenly.

18:09.000 --> 18:14.000
I know it's a, a car explodes, you're done, move on.

18:14.000 --> 18:18.000
Save a word, Frasier.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
I didn't pick, I'm not gonna picture the car

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
slowly turning orange and then blossoming

18:22.000 --> 18:26.000
into a dismantled car over the period of six months.

18:26.000 --> 18:29.000
Have you never said suddenly in a script, even early days?

18:29.000 --> 18:33.000
When I was, uh, dumb and then I grew,

18:33.000 --> 18:37.000
that's why I'm angry, it's called bullying.

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
Okay, pedicabs.

18:40.000 --> 18:44.000
Hey, could we have a more uncomfortable on the nose

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
manifestation of the class system?

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
Okay.

18:47.000 --> 18:51.000
I can't fucking, I'm so lazy, I can't do it,

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
I gotta keep using them, and I'm just sitting back there.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
Could you feel more ancient and more Roman

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
than when you were writing about these things

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
and there's just a guy.

18:58.000 --> 19:02.000
Okay, alright.

19:02.000 --> 19:05.000
Uh, okay, one more.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
No, a ten more.

19:07.000 --> 19:11.000
Okay, this has been a long time coming,

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
I saved it for tonight.

19:13.000 --> 19:16.000
Why would you have a favorite color?

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
I agree.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
What does that mean?

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
It's stupid.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
Stupid.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
Why would you have a favorite color?

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
That doesn't mean anything.

19:25.000 --> 19:28.000
Does that mean you want everything to be that color?

19:28.000 --> 19:31.000
Then you're using color wrong.

19:31.000 --> 19:34.000
That's like having a favorite musical note.

19:34.000 --> 19:37.000
Hat, hat, hat, hat, hat.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
That's it, you wouldn't be a musician,

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
you'd design car alarms.

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
Or people say, what's your favorite flavor ice cream?

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
I said, no, I like ice cream.

19:46.000 --> 19:49.000
Motherfucker, put a hot dog in it on Monday

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
and then put some pretzels in it on Tuesday.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
I don't want a hot dog in my ice cream.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
Yeah, you do.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
No.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
We're gonna prove it by the end of the day.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
You go like ice cream, we just found that out.

19:59.000 --> 20:02.000
You gonna put a hot dog in it on a Monday?

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
I like it.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
Hiroshima.

20:06.000 --> 20:09.000
We did Hiroshima though, right?

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
Yeah, that was our fault.

20:11.000 --> 20:15.000
That's like a, I can't come up with a non-offensive example.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
So I won't.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
Okay.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
You're welcome.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
Spencer, all right.

20:23.000 --> 20:26.000
You're Harry Truman, you're the newly-elect president.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
It's the end of World War II.

20:28.000 --> 20:32.000
Do you drop the atomic bomb, the newly created atomic bomb

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
to end the war and save lives, or do you not do it?

20:34.000 --> 20:37.000
Make your answer thoughtful enough that I can make a drink.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
Okay.

20:38.000 --> 20:43.000
So, I mean, what did Harry Truman do besides that?

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
Anything?

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
Not a whole lot.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
He wasn't in office very long, I don't think.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
Well,

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
See what?

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
The Warsaw pack.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
Warsaw pack.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
Thank you, sir.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
The Warsaw pack.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
He did beat do it.

20:55.000 --> 20:56.000
He did beat do it.

20:56.000 --> 21:00.000
But not according to one newspaper.

21:00.000 --> 21:05.000
So, this is coming off the heels of the Warsaw pack.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
Yeah, he's riding high on that.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
Yeah.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
He's got that Warsaw pack's cachet.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
All right.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
Dance good.

21:12.000 --> 21:16.000
Now, your secretary of defense and war and all those people come in and say,

21:16.000 --> 21:19.000
all right, Mr. President, we have this new weapon.

21:19.000 --> 21:22.000
We're going to drop it, or we won't.

21:22.000 --> 21:26.000
Do we do it to save American lives and kill a zillion people instantly,

21:26.000 --> 21:29.000
or do we not do that morality-wise?

21:29.000 --> 21:33.000
Do we do it to scare off the Nazis and the rest of the world,

21:33.000 --> 21:37.000
the Soviets who are current allies, maybe our next enemy?

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
What do you do?

21:38.000 --> 21:41.000
You're President Spencer Crittenden.

21:41.000 --> 21:47.000
Drop the fucking hammer.

21:47.000 --> 21:51.000
But you know that was not about protecting ourselves from the Japanese.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
We had won that war.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
That was about an excuse.

21:54.000 --> 21:57.000
It was about making them surrender.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
When they were going to lose.

21:59.000 --> 22:00.000
No, it was about revealing.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
Let's bring Logan back up.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
Logan, get back up here.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
I'm kidding, of course.

22:04.000 --> 22:07.000
It was obviously about revealing in our game of Hearthstone

22:07.000 --> 22:10.000
that we had the fucking mushroom cloud card.

22:10.000 --> 22:14.000
Yeah, most actions have multiple reasons, sure.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.000
But that was the reason.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
The Japanese weren't defeated.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
Yeah, but they weren't giving up.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
That was the thing.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
They were defeated, but they weren't giving up.

22:21.000 --> 22:24.000
And they needed to check it out.

22:24.000 --> 22:27.000
Half your city, two of your cities are gone, fucking give up.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
But we were showing that to the world.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
Yeah, both of us are right.

22:31.000 --> 22:32.000
How about that?

22:32.000 --> 22:33.000
Yeah, we're both right.

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
Okay.

22:34.000 --> 22:38.000
I mean, talk about, the real quandary is Nagasaki.

22:38.000 --> 22:39.000
Like why the second one?

22:39.000 --> 22:42.000
The answer in our history books when we were kids.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
Down in Nagasaki where the men on Chuchabaki

22:44.000 --> 22:47.000
and the women wiki-waki-wook?

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
Too soon.

22:49.000 --> 22:52.000
Nagasaki, we dropped the bomb right away on them.

22:52.000 --> 22:56.000
And that was in history, what we learned in American grade schools

22:56.000 --> 22:59.000
is the reason we did that is because, and this sounds,

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
this could either be true or not true,

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
but it just sounds so sixth grade.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
Like we had to drop the bomb on Nagasaki

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
because otherwise they would have thought

23:07.000 --> 23:11.000
we only were able to make one.

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
That's the only reason that I know of.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
That's the only reason that I learned.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
There's like, I mean,

23:16.000 --> 23:19.000
those pilots have written memoirs and books and shit.

23:19.000 --> 23:22.000
There might be some crazy drama surrounding the second bomb, man.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
The second one was about, it missed.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
It flew over a hill.

23:25.000 --> 23:28.000
It didn't take out as much as the town as they hoped it would.

23:28.000 --> 23:29.000
Yeah.

23:29.000 --> 23:32.000
Yeah, they wanted to bomb somewhere else, right?

23:32.000 --> 23:35.000
Yeah, but the weather was bad that day, right?

23:35.000 --> 23:40.000
The weather was bad for bombing.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
That's my main problem with Japan.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
It's usually terrible bombing weather.

23:44.000 --> 23:47.000
Speaking of military strategy,

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
this was a historic comic-con.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
They had drones down on the dock

23:51.000 --> 23:54.000
that were like shaped like the Doctor Who TARDIS.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
And they were flying them up in the air

23:56.000 --> 23:59.000
and the fucking Air Force came in and shut it down.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
What?

24:00.000 --> 24:01.000
Yeah.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
That's what I heard.

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
I wasn't there.

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
Were they jealous?

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
They're like, are you for me?

24:05.000 --> 24:06.000
Jealous?

24:06.000 --> 24:07.000
Make a rectangle.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
Make a saginal...

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
I think they're just so close to it.

24:11.000 --> 24:12.000
I mean, this is a military base.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
San Diego is a military base.

24:14.000 --> 24:18.000
There's an enormous aircraft carrier out in the harbor right now.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
There's a couple.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
Logan, what's the name of the aircraft carrier?

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
That wasn't Logan, but thank you, sir.

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
The Vincent.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
Reagan and the Vincent.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
I don't know any more details on that.

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
The Reagan class?

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
The Reagan and the Vincent.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.000
The Nimitz class.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
Oh, Nimitz class.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
Holy shit.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
Anyways, they had to put a net around

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
where they were demonstrating the drones,

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
because now everyone can have a drone now.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
And so they were like,

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
but you can't have a drone.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
You could wage war on America now

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
with your Dr. Who Tardis.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
They got nervous.

24:48.000 --> 24:52.000
They know shit we don't about drone warfare then,

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
because I don't think anyone out there was thinking,

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
boy, if we put a bomb on this,

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
if we put an ISIS guy on there,

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
and they were thinking that,

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
they're like, if there was an ISIS guy on there...

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
If you put a guy on the drone, it's not a drone anymore.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
It's just a plane.

25:06.000 --> 25:11.000
Not if he's not flying it, though, right?

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
Say what?

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
Not if he's not flying it.

25:13.000 --> 25:14.000
Yeah, what if he's like the bomb?

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
Isn't it still a drone if he's just hanging out?

25:16.000 --> 25:17.000
He's just laying back?

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
Yeah.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
If he's taking a nap, it's a drone.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.000
And he's on a drone.

25:21.000 --> 25:25.000
I've seen Minecraft drones that look like gasts.

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
No one gets it.

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
We all get it.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
I mean, it's not a joke, really.

25:30.000 --> 25:33.000
So, right reaction.

25:33.000 --> 25:34.000
Okay.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.000
Also right reaction.

25:35.000 --> 25:38.000
I want to know more about this guy wearing the banana house.

25:38.000 --> 25:41.000
I don't know if we do.

25:41.000 --> 25:42.000
We don't want to know.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
He's dressed like a banana.

25:43.000 --> 25:44.000
I mean...

25:44.000 --> 25:47.000
No, he's just pointed at himself like me.

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
Oh, no.

25:55.000 --> 25:56.000
Okay, get out here.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
Banana guy.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
Banana gentleman.

26:00.000 --> 26:01.000
What's your name?

26:01.000 --> 26:02.000
Victor.

26:02.000 --> 26:03.000
I should have known.

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
Take that mic, banana guy.

26:05.000 --> 26:06.000
What's your name?

26:06.000 --> 26:07.000
Victor.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.000
Victor.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.000
Why a banana?

26:09.000 --> 26:10.000
Why not?

26:10.000 --> 26:11.000
Yeah.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.000
Alright.

26:12.000 --> 26:13.000
San Diego.

26:13.000 --> 26:14.000
Alright.

26:14.000 --> 26:17.000
Victor, what is your greatest fear in life?

26:17.000 --> 26:18.000
What's your...

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
What's the motivating fear in your life?

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
When you wake up and you have a bad dream,

26:22.000 --> 26:25.000
what's the thing that is the most terrifying possibility

26:25.000 --> 26:28.000
for a gentleman that wears a banana outfit?

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
Well, I'm in character right now.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
So, someone eating me.

26:32.000 --> 26:33.000
No, for real.

26:33.000 --> 26:34.000
Just Victor.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.000
Not banana guy.

26:35.000 --> 26:36.000
Victor.

26:38.000 --> 26:41.000
Not knowing what to say?

26:41.000 --> 26:42.000
Really?

26:42.000 --> 26:43.000
Yes.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
Well, what's the worst that could happen

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
if you didn't know what to say?

26:46.000 --> 26:49.000
People stare at me.

26:49.000 --> 26:50.000
So, as a...

26:50.000 --> 26:54.000
But now we tie it back into you dressing like a banana.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
Because your biggest indirect fear

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
is people staring at you.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
No, but I get it because then when you're...

26:59.000 --> 27:00.000
if you dress like a banana,

27:00.000 --> 27:03.000
people will stare at you and you don't have to say anything.

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
You've said it all.

27:04.000 --> 27:05.000
I'm a banana.

27:05.000 --> 27:06.000
Like a dance.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.000
And you're...

27:07.000 --> 27:08.000
So, your fear...

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
Like Barack Obama doesn't dress like a banana.

27:10.000 --> 27:11.000
He becomes president.

27:11.000 --> 27:12.000
Like, you're like,

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
look at me, I'm a banana.

27:14.000 --> 27:15.000
That goes to my thesis earlier,

27:15.000 --> 27:16.000
that people go like,

27:16.000 --> 27:17.000
hey, Deadpool, can I get a picture?

27:17.000 --> 27:18.000
And you're like,

27:18.000 --> 27:19.000
I feel like I'm somebody.

27:19.000 --> 27:20.000
I get that.

27:20.000 --> 27:21.000
I get it.

27:21.000 --> 27:24.000
Like, my banana costume is like having a feud with Chevy Chase

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
and like...

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
Like, whatever it takes to...

27:28.000 --> 27:29.000
I get it.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
Like, because I get the feeling of like,

27:31.000 --> 27:32.000
oh, I have an identity now

27:32.000 --> 27:35.000
and I don't disparage it at all.

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
What's...

27:37.000 --> 27:40.000
Where are you at on the Kinsey scale, do you think?

27:42.000 --> 27:45.000
If 100% is like just totally straight as an arrow...

27:45.000 --> 27:46.000
One to six, right?

27:46.000 --> 27:47.000
One to seven.

27:47.000 --> 27:48.000
Oh, is it one to six?

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
One to six.

27:50.000 --> 27:53.000
One being straightest.

27:53.000 --> 27:54.000
What is the scale?

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
I think one is straightest

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
and six is like...

27:58.000 --> 27:59.000
You can go by hypotheticals.

27:59.000 --> 28:03.000
Like, if another dude dressed as a banana came in

28:03.000 --> 28:06.000
and he looked like Ewan McGregor...

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
Well, that's not even...

28:08.000 --> 28:09.000
That's a...

28:09.000 --> 28:10.000
You'd hit that?

28:10.000 --> 28:11.000
Totally.

28:11.000 --> 28:12.000
Okay.

28:12.000 --> 28:13.000
Alright, that's a good enough answer.

28:13.000 --> 28:14.000
That's at least a three.

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
Is he really dressed like a banana?

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
Yeah, of course he's dressed like a banana.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.000
Then you can just split and get out of here.

28:19.000 --> 28:20.000
That'd be cool.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
Oh, you guys like...

28:22.000 --> 28:23.000
You guys like word play.

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
There are three banana punts in the world

28:25.000 --> 28:26.000
and that's one of them.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
What's the second one?

28:28.000 --> 28:29.000
I can't...

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
I'm going bananas.

28:31.000 --> 28:34.000
You're doing it for the group appeal.

28:38.000 --> 28:39.000
Victors of the banana, everybody.

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
Victors of the banana.

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
Banana man!

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
It's a banana.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
Alright.

28:49.000 --> 28:50.000
We met a banana today.

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
Alright, question for you.

28:52.000 --> 28:53.000
Yeah?

28:53.000 --> 28:54.000
There's this movie,

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
James Franco and Jonah Hill are in it.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
It's called True Story.

28:58.000 --> 29:01.000
It's on all the hotel TVs right now.

29:01.000 --> 29:02.000
I didn't really notice it in theaters.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
And on all the hotel TVs?

29:04.000 --> 29:05.000
Yeah, everyone.

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
So it's like about a murderer

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
and it's based on the True Story

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
and it's called True Story

29:10.000 --> 29:11.000
and it's like...

29:11.000 --> 29:12.000
It's a serious movie.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
Do you think that...

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
Do you think that Jonah Hill's agent

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
and James Franco's agent both separately

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
were like, dude, you got to do...

29:20.000 --> 29:21.000
You got to do another serious one.

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
Like, you've been silly for like five movies in a row.

29:23.000 --> 29:26.000
Like, let's show them your money ball chops

29:26.000 --> 29:30.000
or your guy with the arm behind a rock chops.

29:31.000 --> 29:32.000
And then they both...

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
Do you think they both separately were like,

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
okay, yeah, yeah, I got to pay some dues.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
Let's show them some drama shit.

29:38.000 --> 29:39.000
Let's get an Oscar.

29:39.000 --> 29:40.000
And then they walked in a set

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
and they're like, what the fuck?

29:42.000 --> 29:43.000
When they saw each other,

29:43.000 --> 29:46.000
no one's going to take this movie seriously.

29:46.000 --> 29:47.000
Like, you got to put money ball

29:47.000 --> 29:50.000
with like a dramatic actor and vice versa.

29:50.000 --> 29:51.000
You can't...

29:51.000 --> 29:52.000
They look ridiculous together

29:52.000 --> 29:53.000
and it's a terrible movie.

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
Okay, let's move on.

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
So I saw a three-legged dog

29:57.000 --> 29:58.000
walking down the streets of San Diego.

29:58.000 --> 29:59.000
I think I saw that dog.

29:59.000 --> 30:00.000
I love this joke.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
I love this joke.

30:02.000 --> 30:03.000
It's not a joke.

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
There's a dog with three legs

30:05.000 --> 30:06.000
with the missing leg was...

30:06.000 --> 30:07.000
Goes into a bar.

30:07.000 --> 30:12.000
The missing leg was in the back.

30:12.000 --> 30:15.000
And I was watching it and the...

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
You can't tell when dogs...

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
The fact that the dog could have three legs

30:18.000 --> 30:22.000
and not show it on its face

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
kind of makes me panic about

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
how well I'm taking care of my dog.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
Because my dog always looks happy

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
and so did this dog.

30:30.000 --> 30:33.000
And he's one quarter down

30:33.000 --> 30:37.000
of the fundamental economy of dogmas.

30:37.000 --> 30:40.000
He's totally fucked as a dog

30:40.000 --> 30:41.000
and he was like,

30:41.000 --> 30:42.000
yeah, let's go to...

30:42.000 --> 30:45.000
Anybody got some bacon?

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
But the thing that was really distracting

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
was like assuming that's a male dog

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
because I think female dogs kind of squat.

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
So does Harvey.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
Do you know this that male dogs

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
learn to lift a leg from each other?

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
It's like a learned behavior.

30:59.000 --> 31:00.000
No.

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
Male dogs, if they're left in a vacuum,

31:02.000 --> 31:06.000
they'll squat and just pee down.

31:06.000 --> 31:09.000
Where's Harvey on the Kenzie scale?

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
I don't know.

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
But anyways, so I was like,

31:13.000 --> 31:16.000
assuming that's a male dog,

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
what does he do when he pees?

31:18.000 --> 31:21.000
Because half of his back legs are gone.

31:21.000 --> 31:24.000
If he lifts one, he falls right over.

31:24.000 --> 31:27.000
So then right as I said that,

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
he's stopped by a telephone pole

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
and it's like the answer was right in front of me.

31:31.000 --> 31:34.000
This dog, the one great thing about his life

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
is there's no leg to lift.

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
He just stopped next to a telephone pole

31:38.000 --> 31:42.000
and shot a fucking laser to the side.

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
He doesn't have to do anything.

31:44.000 --> 31:47.000
He has like fast and furious seven turrets

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
that come out of this.

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
He just shoots sideways.

31:51.000 --> 31:55.000
Anyways, okay, so it's a San Diego Comic Con podcast

31:55.000 --> 31:58.000
and you're getting a lot of fast bits.

31:58.000 --> 32:01.000
Okay, alright, you ever seen a commercial,

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
like a Mountain Dew commercial or a Chip commercial

32:03.000 --> 32:07.000
where a kid rides a bike up a ramp

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
and then he does a somersault on the bike

32:09.000 --> 32:12.000
and then the whole bike and him go into the ocean?

32:12.000 --> 32:13.000
Where does the bike go?

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
What does he do with the...

32:15.000 --> 32:19.000
Is there a bunch of bikes down there?

32:19.000 --> 32:23.000
Does he have to swim with the bike like he's rescuing it?

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
What a dumb thing to do.

32:25.000 --> 32:28.000
Dangerous and stupid.

32:28.000 --> 32:32.000
Are you worried about the bikes or about the ecology?

32:32.000 --> 32:35.000
I think I'm worried about the earth, yeah.

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
I think once we solve all our other problems

32:37.000 --> 32:40.000
we're gonna have to deal with this mountain of bikes.

32:40.000 --> 32:43.000
If anybody had the time or the energy, go to Huntington Beach, California

32:43.000 --> 32:46.000
where I spent most of my time ditching high school

32:46.000 --> 32:50.000
and most of my wallets are there.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
About 20 yards out.

32:52.000 --> 32:55.000
I kept going into the water with a wallet in my pocket

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
and you come out with no wallet.

32:57.000 --> 32:58.000
They're all there.

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
You think there's pickpockets down there?

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
It's those fish, man.

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
Oh, your wallets are out.

33:04.000 --> 33:05.000
They just fall out.

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
Yeah, it was in a pocket.

33:07.000 --> 33:11.000
Okay, how do you feel about the Bloody Mary Arms Race?

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
About putting shit in the Bloody Mary?

33:13.000 --> 33:14.000
Yeah.

33:14.000 --> 33:17.000
I feel, you start all fucking follow-up.

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
I feel very strongly about it.

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
In Portland, you order a Bloody Mary.

33:21.000 --> 33:24.000
And it comes with a sandwich on it and the whole thing, yeah.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
Like everybody's in this arms race.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
A Bloody Mary should be a small drink.

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
It shouldn't be a giant, I know there's bartenders here

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
and I don't want you guys to be offended.

33:32.000 --> 33:35.000
It should not be in a pint glass with ice and a bunch of shit in it.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
It should be in a small, high bar glass.

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
It should be chilled with a lemon.

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
And that's it.

33:41.000 --> 33:42.000
Right?

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
Was that Logan?

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
Who was that?

33:46.000 --> 33:49.000
It should be restorative drink.

33:49.000 --> 33:52.000
You drink that one to get your shit back together

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
so you can start drinking booze again.

33:54.000 --> 33:55.000
Like a real drink.

33:55.000 --> 33:58.000
You shouldn't have a 19-ounce Bloody Mary with a cheeseburger on it.

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
There's places with a turkey leg dipped in it

34:00.000 --> 34:03.000
and then there's like two snorkels coming out.

34:03.000 --> 34:08.000
If you tell a bartender, I just want it chilled up in a glass with a lemon.

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
They look at you like you're fucking crazy.

34:10.000 --> 34:13.000
That you don't want 19 things hanging off the side of it.

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
Fucking kill everybody.

34:15.000 --> 34:16.000
Alright.

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
Final beverage question.

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
This ends my segment.

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
Our whole show's a segment.

34:22.000 --> 34:26.000
A lot of these kids out here, they're younger than us.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
But they went to schools.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
I just want to ask, I just got very curious about this

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
because I was remembering my cafeteria days.

34:32.000 --> 34:37.000
Have they made these half pint milk cartons easier to fucking open yet?

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
Or do you still have to...

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
There's like 25% of them.

34:41.000 --> 34:44.000
You have to rip open like Wolverine to get in the...

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
You look like a fucking asshole.

34:46.000 --> 34:49.000
Why do the jocks always know how to do it better?

34:49.000 --> 34:52.000
What are we doing wrong?

34:52.000 --> 34:53.000
Is it still that?

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
It's just a bunch of glue and paper

34:55.000 --> 34:58.000
and you just have to take the luck of the draw?

34:58.000 --> 34:59.000
Okay, just checking.

34:59.000 --> 35:03.000
Yeah, why would they change that? Who's going to profit from that?

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
They put water on cartons.

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
Are they easier to open or is it the same?

35:07.000 --> 35:08.000
Yeah.

35:08.000 --> 35:12.000
They make you drink water out of a half pint carton?

35:12.000 --> 35:17.000
It's better for the earth.

35:17.000 --> 35:20.000
What about water fountains?

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
That's worse for the earth?

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
Plastic bottles.

35:24.000 --> 35:27.000
But I mean, what about the water fountains?

35:27.000 --> 35:30.000
They never served me water in the cafeteria.

35:30.000 --> 35:33.000
I don't know what conversation this is.

35:37.000 --> 35:41.000
They never served you water at the cafeteria?

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
Yeah. No, they did not.

35:43.000 --> 35:44.000
No.

35:44.000 --> 35:48.000
So why are they putting water in half pint cardboard cartons?

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
To save the earth.

35:50.000 --> 35:51.000
From what?

35:51.000 --> 35:52.000
From plastic.

35:52.000 --> 35:55.000
They don't give you plastic bottles in the cafeteria.

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
Okay, they do now? Well, that's their problem.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
They should stop doing that.

35:59.000 --> 36:03.000
Are we only talking about in the schools?

36:03.000 --> 36:06.000
Because I feel like I've seen them in stores.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
You know, like bigger ones.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
Right, bigger. Yes, that I get.

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
I'm talking about in schools.

36:12.000 --> 36:13.000
Cafeteria.

36:13.000 --> 36:16.000
Mock chicken leg and your green beans and your ketchup.

36:16.000 --> 36:19.000
Wait, the kids ones are the easiest to open at any carton.

36:19.000 --> 36:22.000
It's those minute-made ones from Jack in the Box

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
that are the real problem.

36:24.000 --> 36:27.000
Fifth, that's the real problem.

36:27.000 --> 36:28.000
Let me tell you.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
Also, I've read poachers.

36:30.000 --> 36:35.000
Okay, I want to bring up a guy that I met at a signing.

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
Because I hope he's here.

36:37.000 --> 36:42.000
He came up and he was getting his Rick and Morty stuff signed.

36:42.000 --> 36:46.000
And then he asked Justin and I, Justin and me,

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
Justin and you.

36:48.000 --> 36:51.000
Justin and we.

36:51.000 --> 36:54.000
He got the signature and then he said,

36:54.000 --> 36:59.000
by the way, what are each of your guys' favorite Tom Petty songs?

36:59.000 --> 37:02.000
And Justin answered and then I said,

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
I guess Free Fallen, I don't know,

37:04.000 --> 37:07.000
which Dino told me today was the wrong answer.

37:07.000 --> 37:10.000
But at any rate, he took the two answers

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
and then he was like, okay, thanks.

37:12.000 --> 37:15.000
I started to walk away and I was like, get back here.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.000
Why?

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
You do get to ask me that.

37:18.000 --> 37:21.000
And he said, oh, I'm just really into Tom Petty and I really,

37:21.000 --> 37:25.000
I always ask everybody that.

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
And I was like, can you please, are you coming to the show

37:27.000 --> 37:30.000
and will you please come up and, you know,

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
being passionate about something so specific,

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
like I just like to meet these people.

37:34.000 --> 37:35.000
Is Robert here?

37:35.000 --> 37:36.000
Robert, are you here?

37:36.000 --> 37:37.000
No?

37:37.000 --> 37:38.000
Nope.

37:38.000 --> 37:39.000
Oh, he shot his family.

37:39.000 --> 37:40.000
Okay.

37:40.000 --> 37:44.000
Wait, he didn't come?

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
He turned Free Fallen up to 11.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
And I'm free.

37:48.000 --> 37:54.000
Free Fallen running down a dream.

37:54.000 --> 37:58.000
Don't come around here no more.

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
Wait, did you invite him to the show

38:00.000 --> 38:01.000
and he didn't fucking come?

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
He said he was going to be at the show.

38:03.000 --> 38:04.000
I wouldn't invite him to the show.

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
These people went through hell and back

38:06.000 --> 38:11.000
to get into the show.

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
But I thought he was going to be here.

38:13.000 --> 38:16.000
I went to go see the Jeff Lynn documentary

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
called Mr. Blue Sky, which is great.

38:18.000 --> 38:21.000
And I was standing at Nokia Live,

38:21.000 --> 38:22.000
like a small theater.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
And I was standing in a little corridor.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
And we were so rammed together.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
There was a short guy next to me with a hat.

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
And I couldn't see his face because he was shorter than me.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
He had a big hat, a Gandalf hair.

38:32.000 --> 38:35.000
And he was smoking early days vape pen.

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
But it was clearly like weed.

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
And he's like, hey man, you want some?

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
I was like, what is it?

38:41.000 --> 38:42.000
Marijuana?

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
I go, no, that'll get me too high.

38:44.000 --> 38:45.000
I get too high in marijuana.

38:45.000 --> 38:46.000
I go, hash it.

38:46.000 --> 38:47.000
And he goes, oh shit.

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
If you know him when he has any hash, oh fuck off.

38:49.000 --> 38:50.000
I want that hash.

38:50.000 --> 38:51.000
Oh, man.

38:51.000 --> 38:52.000
I couldn't see his face.

38:52.000 --> 38:53.000
He had a big brim hat.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
And I was like, who the fuck is this guy?

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
He's American, so he's not in ELO.

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
Who the fuck is this guy?

38:59.000 --> 39:00.000
He sits down in front of me.

39:00.000 --> 39:05.000
He's fucking Tom Petty.

39:05.000 --> 39:06.000
I was like, I was so happy.

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
I didn't know that it was Tom Petty.

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
Because I would never have been that glib

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
and chatty with him.

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
I would have been freaking out the whole time.

39:14.000 --> 39:15.000
He just wanted to be like, yeah,

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
if you can score some hash oil, man,

39:17.000 --> 39:20.000
let's fucking do that shit.

39:20.000 --> 39:21.000
What if he just kept bugging you

39:21.000 --> 39:22.000
for the rest of your life?

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
He was like, hey, Tom.

39:24.000 --> 39:25.000
I found some hash oil.

39:25.000 --> 39:28.000
I thought we had an agreement.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
I mean, I guess I picked wrong with Free Fall

39:30.000 --> 39:31.000
and I don't know.

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
Because Dino was going like, that's the wrong side.

39:33.000 --> 39:34.000
I'm like, what would you pick?

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
And he's like, I can't remember what he said.

39:36.000 --> 39:37.000
But he said, I won't back down.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
I'm like, well, that's just whining.

39:39.000 --> 39:42.000
Also, isn't there a bit where like,

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
most of Tom Petty's songs have the word

39:44.000 --> 39:45.000
down in the title?

39:45.000 --> 39:46.000
There's like a lot of them.

39:46.000 --> 39:47.000
There's Running Down a Dream.

39:47.000 --> 39:48.000
I won't back down.

39:48.000 --> 39:49.000
I think there's a bunch more.

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
But the only part of Free Fall that I like

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
is when he actually literally says,

39:53.000 --> 39:54.000
and I'm free, Free Falling,

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
because the rest of the song is like Bad Mountain Goats,

39:56.000 --> 39:59.000
kind of like over specific geographic stuff.

39:59.000 --> 40:02.000
I was like, I'm on, I'm on first street

40:02.000 --> 40:05.000
eating pretzel.

40:05.000 --> 40:08.000
There's a goat leash and a shoe on my foot.

40:08.000 --> 40:11.000
That's like an old singer thing.

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
They run out of chops,

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
and then they just start fucking grinding

40:15.000 --> 40:16.000
at specificity.

40:16.000 --> 40:19.000
They're like, I'm on third and Wabash

40:19.000 --> 40:22.000
in 2252, Recita.

40:22.000 --> 40:26.000
I know that's something old people do.

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
There's some plywood,

40:28.000 --> 40:32.000
and it costs 3.99 a pound at Home Depot,

40:32.000 --> 40:35.000
on Ventura Boulevard.

40:35.000 --> 40:39.000
Whenever you're getting geographically specific,

40:39.000 --> 40:42.000
you're blying some fucking,

40:42.000 --> 40:45.000
because young kids, we love music by 22-year-olds

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
that are, you listen to the lyrics of the songs we love,

40:47.000 --> 40:51.000
and they're just like, I won't let you down.

40:51.000 --> 40:54.000
I love you so much.

40:54.000 --> 40:55.000
And we're like, you're adorable,

40:55.000 --> 40:56.000
and this is awesome,

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
and I'm going to have sex to this song.

40:58.000 --> 41:01.000
But they're not poets.

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
They don't have to be, because they're young.

41:03.000 --> 41:09.000
But old people are just like, September 3rd.

41:09.000 --> 41:13.000
The day after Mother's Day.

41:13.000 --> 41:17.000
The barometric pressure was 72%.

41:17.000 --> 41:21.000
I get into my Chevy 57 Impala.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
Like, stop telling me all this shit.

41:23.000 --> 41:26.000
Like, get your shit out of my fucking brain.

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
Just tell me what it feels to be alive.

41:28.000 --> 41:29.000
You don't know, do you?

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
You don't know.

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
You just have memories of random shit.

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
That's what Alzheimer's patients do.

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
I remember a fuzzy slipper.

41:37.000 --> 41:40.000
Mom, go to bed.

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
Do you want to have sex?

41:42.000 --> 41:45.000
I'm your son, go to bed.

41:45.000 --> 41:48.000
But Howard Hughes is about to sing Winky Doodle.

41:48.000 --> 41:49.000
You're wrong.

41:49.000 --> 41:52.000
That's George Gershwin.

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
You pick the wrong song.

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
You pick the one that's all specific.

41:56.000 --> 42:01.000
And the part that's like, free, free falling.

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
Because Tom Penny's whiny.

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
And so if you're going to whine about something,

42:05.000 --> 42:06.000
whine about being free.

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
Him saying I won't back down is kind of like,

42:08.000 --> 42:11.000
you just sound stubborn.

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
Johnny Cash singing I won't back down,

42:13.000 --> 42:14.000
it sounds badass.

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
I won't back down.

42:16.000 --> 42:20.000
Like, oh shit, this guy's going to stop apartheid.

42:20.000 --> 42:21.000
Or something.

42:21.000 --> 42:25.000
He won't back down from fucking, from the third rite.

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
Like, it sounds badass.

42:27.000 --> 42:30.000
Tom Penny is like, when he said I won't back down,

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
it sounds like he didn't get the right kind of mustard

42:32.000 --> 42:33.000
or something.

42:33.000 --> 42:36.000
Eh, I want a refund.

42:36.000 --> 42:39.000
I'm not leaving here without my money back.

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
I won't back down.

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
I'm putting my foot down.

42:43.000 --> 42:46.000
Because I'm a consumer watchdog.

42:46.000 --> 42:49.000
And I won't back down.

42:49.000 --> 42:52.000
And if you go on to my Tumblr blog,

42:52.000 --> 42:59.000
you can see the other companies I've written to.

42:59.000 --> 43:03.000
I won't shop at Fry's, baby.

43:03.000 --> 43:06.000
Their customer service is rude.

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
How do you film a Bob Dylan?

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
Are you a Bob Dylan fan?

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
I guess I missed out on that.

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
I'm sure he was very ironic and interesting

43:14.000 --> 43:17.000
when, in 1928?

43:17.000 --> 43:18.000
Yeah.

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
That was his early stuff.

43:20.000 --> 43:23.000
That was certainly his very early stuff.

43:23.000 --> 43:24.000
I get it.

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
I mean, I guess Easy Writer's a good movie.

43:26.000 --> 43:27.000
I don't know.

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
No, I'm saying, I'm comparing the two.

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
I'm not saying Bob Dylan was an Easy Writer.

43:31.000 --> 43:34.000
But I'm saying, like, there's shit that you miss the boat on

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
and you kind of historically look and go,

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
oh, okay, I understand the significance.

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
What's your guilty pleasure at home?

43:40.000 --> 43:44.000
Like, your music, if you're alone and want to wallow.

43:44.000 --> 43:45.000
I'm assuming, like, you and I,

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
I think we both have talked about this before.

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
We like sad songs.

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
Who's your guilty pleasure?

43:51.000 --> 43:54.000
I've listened to Dream Pop and, like,

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
I mean, now I listen to, like, shit that,

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
to me, is modern, but then Aaron goes,

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
that's from 2006.

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
I listened to that in grade school.

44:02.000 --> 44:05.000
How old is she?

44:05.000 --> 44:08.000
I'm really into the postal service or whatever.

44:08.000 --> 44:12.000
I'm like, man, I hope my wife over here is this.

44:12.000 --> 44:13.000
She's going to get turned on.

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
I'm very young and hip.

44:15.000 --> 44:18.000
And she's like, that's what, the Beetlejuice was in theaters.

44:18.000 --> 44:22.000
Like, why are you...

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
But, yeah, I don't know.

44:24.000 --> 44:25.000
I like moody sad songs.

44:25.000 --> 44:26.000
Spencer, how about you?

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
What's your go-to?

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
When you're at home, do you play music?

44:30.000 --> 44:33.000
No, I mean, when I'm driving around,

44:33.000 --> 44:36.000
I listen to either NPR, which is...

44:36.000 --> 44:42.000
Yeah, they do music, too, so it's not just that.

44:42.000 --> 44:43.000
And then also...

44:43.000 --> 44:44.000
I think it's going to be the first show

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
where people have screamed and it wounded for NPR.

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
I doubt that, man.

44:48.000 --> 44:51.000
NPR is great.

44:51.000 --> 44:54.000
Have you heard...

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
I heard a piece on NPR.

44:56.000 --> 44:57.000
I don't know if this is true.

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
I don't know how scientifically accurate this is.

44:59.000 --> 45:00.000
It's true.

45:00.000 --> 45:04.000
But supposedly, the morning is becoming less and less eclectic.

45:04.000 --> 45:05.000
No.

45:05.000 --> 45:06.000
Yeah.

45:06.000 --> 45:09.000
It's by, like, six inches a year.

45:09.000 --> 45:10.000
Okay.

45:10.000 --> 45:14.000
Yeah, by 2019, the morning won't be eclectic.

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
It's true.

45:16.000 --> 45:19.000
It's thanks to Chris Doritos.

45:19.000 --> 45:23.000
You guys don't listen to Morning Becomes Eclectic this week.

45:23.000 --> 45:24.000
You'd know.

45:24.000 --> 45:27.000
He's sitting in for Jason Bentley.

45:27.000 --> 45:28.000
They don't get up that early.

45:28.000 --> 45:31.000
See, they know who Jason Bentley is.

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
Well, these guys do.

45:33.000 --> 45:36.000
Dan, if you could be in a band, like a big rock band,

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
like a major thing, would you be lead singer,

45:38.000 --> 45:42.000
guitar, drums, bass, laying in the background,

45:42.000 --> 45:45.000
keyboard, background singer, maybe?

45:45.000 --> 45:46.000
Like, background vocals.

45:46.000 --> 45:49.000
What would you be if you could be in a huge band?

45:49.000 --> 45:54.000
Well, are we in this hypothetical universe?

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
Does my talent knows no bounds and also...

45:56.000 --> 45:59.000
You could be as good or as bad as you want to be.

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
Well, I'd be the lead singer.

46:01.000 --> 46:02.000
Okay.

46:02.000 --> 46:05.000
And so would every bass player.

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
If they could.

46:07.000 --> 46:10.000
Otherwise, why are they on stage?

46:10.000 --> 46:13.000
I wish I was singing.

46:13.000 --> 46:16.000
Their personalities, they would rather be slightly...

46:16.000 --> 46:19.000
I don't believe that's true at all.

46:19.000 --> 46:23.000
Rock bands are like five people.

46:23.000 --> 46:27.000
If you show me the second chair violinist,

46:27.000 --> 46:30.000
the LA Philharmonic, I'll believe that she doesn't wish

46:30.000 --> 46:33.000
that she was David Lee Roth.

46:33.000 --> 46:36.000
I don't believe that Dave Grohl didn't wish he was Kurt Cobain.

46:36.000 --> 46:44.000
That's not as soon as fucking right on time.

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
I don't believe it.

46:46.000 --> 46:49.000
I think rock bands are the reason they're fun to watch

46:49.000 --> 46:52.000
is because there's five dudes who all hate each other

46:52.000 --> 46:53.000
and wish that they...

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
I know musicians that are happy.

46:55.000 --> 46:56.000
They're happy.

46:56.000 --> 46:59.000
I want to be on stage, but I would never want the onus

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
of being the front woman.

47:01.000 --> 47:04.000
But why is it an onus if you're so good?

47:04.000 --> 47:07.000
That's why I asked, am I so good that I don't have to worry about shit?

47:07.000 --> 47:10.000
Then, yeah, I'll take all the attention.

47:10.000 --> 47:13.000
Keanu Reeves told me we were very drunk in Vegas one time.

47:13.000 --> 47:14.000
He's like...

47:14.000 --> 47:17.000
Holy crap.

47:17.000 --> 47:18.000
He's like...

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
His favorite thing is playing bass.

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
He likes playing bass and not...

47:22.000 --> 47:23.000
He doesn't charm the crowd.

47:23.000 --> 47:24.000
He doesn't rock out.

47:24.000 --> 47:25.000
He just hangs his head down.

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
This is back in the Dog Star days.

47:27.000 --> 47:28.000
It was a long time ago.

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
And he goes, he's like, Jeff, being in a band

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
is the greatest thing in the world.

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
He'd rather use that than be a movie star.

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
If he had his way, he would be

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
second-settled hair in his face

47:38.000 --> 47:39.000
and no one knew that he...

47:39.000 --> 47:42.000
That doesn't mean that if God came down with a magic wand

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
and touched his throat

47:44.000 --> 47:47.000
and made him sound like Frank Sinatra,

47:47.000 --> 47:48.000
he wouldn't be like...

47:48.000 --> 47:51.000
I'd still just want to play bass.

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
He'd be like...

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
Oh, shoot, I guess I'm the best at this.

47:57.000 --> 48:00.000
A lot of drummers that I know don't want to be up front.

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
But are they good singers?

48:02.000 --> 48:03.000
Are they good singers?

48:03.000 --> 48:04.000
No, they want to drum.

48:04.000 --> 48:05.000
They want to do that.

48:05.000 --> 48:06.000
I know, but if they could...

48:06.000 --> 48:07.000
Look at Phil Collins.

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
He's croaking out shit while he's drumming.

48:09.000 --> 48:10.000
He's like...

48:10.000 --> 48:11.000
By applause.

48:11.000 --> 48:12.000
Are there musicians here

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
that don't want to be a lead singer

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
and would rather be doing else?

48:16.000 --> 48:19.000
You're just getting lies.

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
He's called all those people liars.

48:23.000 --> 48:26.000
There's a difference between asking people

48:26.000 --> 48:31.000
if you could be at the spotlight,

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
would you take it?

48:33.000 --> 48:34.000
And asking them,

48:34.000 --> 48:38.000
are you very happy to take a backseat?

48:38.000 --> 48:39.000
When I was working on...

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
I think there are people that don't want the spotlight

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
under any circumstances.

48:43.000 --> 48:46.000
You're taking a position that's very hard

48:46.000 --> 48:49.000
to disagree with without being uncharismatic

48:49.000 --> 48:52.000
because I'm taking the elitist position.

48:52.000 --> 48:53.000
But I will say,

48:53.000 --> 48:56.000
in support of your point,

48:56.000 --> 49:02.000
when I was working on the 81st Oscars,

49:02.000 --> 49:05.000
which I guess I probably...

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
I was...

49:07.000 --> 49:08.000
Jack Black called me down

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
because he wanted me to write his pattern,

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
and he was presenting with Jennifer Aniston.

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
And I had a headset out on a little clipboard,

49:14.000 --> 49:15.000
and it was like,

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
oh boy, I got to go down and see Mrs. Aniston

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
and Mr. Black.

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
And they were like...

49:21.000 --> 49:22.000
I wrote a joke for them,

49:22.000 --> 49:23.000
and then they were like,

49:23.000 --> 49:24.000
they didn't like the joke,

49:24.000 --> 49:25.000
and I had to rewrite it.

49:25.000 --> 49:26.000
And I was very...

49:26.000 --> 49:27.000
In that moment,

49:27.000 --> 49:28.000
I was very activated.

49:28.000 --> 49:29.000
I liked it.

49:29.000 --> 49:32.000
And if you had stuck a thermometer in me at that point,

49:32.000 --> 49:33.000
and asked,

49:33.000 --> 49:34.000
are you miserable?

49:34.000 --> 49:35.000
Do you hate them?

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
Do you wish you were presenting at the Oscars?

49:37.000 --> 49:38.000
I wouldn't have said yes.

49:38.000 --> 49:41.000
I was happy in my position.

49:41.000 --> 49:42.000
I felt supportive.

49:42.000 --> 49:43.000
I felt activated.

49:43.000 --> 49:44.000
I felt content.

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
That's different from saying,

49:46.000 --> 49:49.000
would you switch places with Jennifer Aniston?

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
Which I would.

49:51.000 --> 49:54.000
What's the first thing you would do

49:54.000 --> 49:57.000
if you were suddenly Jennifer Aniston?

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
Oh, so much.

49:59.000 --> 50:05.000
I would start by making health care socialized.

50:05.000 --> 50:08.000
Why do you think she hasn't already done that?

50:08.000 --> 50:11.000
I'm sure she has in her little neck of the woods,

50:11.000 --> 50:12.000
but like,

50:12.000 --> 50:15.000
I would use her power for good.

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
I don't know.

50:17.000 --> 50:20.000
This conversation is dumb.

50:20.000 --> 50:25.000
I would suspect that you and I would both want to be lead singers,

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
but there are people that would rather play drums

50:27.000 --> 50:28.000
and rather be,

50:28.000 --> 50:29.000
right?

50:29.000 --> 50:30.000
This guy?

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
Logan.

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
Fucking Logan.

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
I feel like,

50:36.000 --> 50:39.000
it's a very uncharismatic thing for me to say

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
that if you are a bass player,

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
you must wish you were a singer.

50:43.000 --> 50:44.000
It's different from saying,

50:44.000 --> 50:45.000
I don't think that's,

50:45.000 --> 50:46.000
it's semantics.

50:46.000 --> 50:49.000
Our language doesn't have the nuance to divide those lines.

50:49.000 --> 50:50.000
We're just saying like,

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
if you like being on stage

50:52.000 --> 50:53.000
and you like playing an instrument

50:53.000 --> 50:56.000
and you like performing for people in a concert,

50:56.000 --> 50:59.000
if a fairy godmother like Tutt

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
would be able to transform you into a person

51:01.000 --> 51:04.000
who had perfect pitch

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
and amazing dance moves

51:06.000 --> 51:09.000
or beautiful hair

51:09.000 --> 51:12.000
or whatever it is that makes you feel like

51:12.000 --> 51:15.000
you don't belong at the very front of the performance,

51:15.000 --> 51:18.000
would you then do it?

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
And at a certain point,

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
aren't you actually kind of,

51:22.000 --> 51:25.000
I mean being dishonest if you'd say no.

51:25.000 --> 51:28.000
You're like, no, I want to stand behind

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
a lead singer

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
and have everyone pointing at me and going,

51:32.000 --> 51:35.000
let the bass player sing.

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
I think that would come down to more just personalities,

51:37.000 --> 51:38.000
like your own thing,

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
like let's say you had a great head of hair

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
and a great voice and everything.

51:42.000 --> 51:43.000
And you still say, no,

51:43.000 --> 51:46.000
I would still like to be a role player,

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
like be the bass player, be the drummer,

51:48.000 --> 51:52.000
be the cello, play a second violin.

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
But I think when you're in a band,

51:54.000 --> 51:55.000
like you had said before,

51:55.000 --> 51:56.000
you should always surround yourself

51:56.000 --> 51:57.000
with people that intimidate you.

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
So if you are in a band

51:59.000 --> 52:00.000
and you're not like,

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
and the guy that's actually the lead singer,

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
if he's not a guy that you are like,

52:04.000 --> 52:07.000
man, I wish I could sing like that,

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
then you're not in the right band.

52:09.000 --> 52:12.000
Like you, if you're like,

52:12.000 --> 52:15.000
this kid, he sings like shit,

52:15.000 --> 52:16.000
but I'll let him.

52:16.000 --> 52:17.000
Like you're in the wrong band.

52:17.000 --> 52:18.000
You're actually being an asshole

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
by not quitting that band

52:20.000 --> 52:21.000
and going and finding a band

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
where the lead singer is like,

52:23.000 --> 52:26.000
holy shit, this guy's a star.

52:26.000 --> 52:29.000
So that, if you extend that train of thought,

52:29.000 --> 52:32.000
it's like, so if you magically,

52:32.000 --> 52:35.000
if you had those proclivities,

52:35.000 --> 52:38.000
instead of your bass player proclivities,

52:38.000 --> 52:41.000
what position of the band would you play?

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
It's almost like a non-question

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
because it's just sort of like, we all,

52:45.000 --> 52:46.000
what we want is an identity.

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
We want to be the guy dressed as Deadpool.

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
We want to be the guy that got fired by NBC.

52:50.000 --> 52:53.000
We want to be the Mario guy.

52:53.000 --> 52:54.000
The guy dressed as a banana.

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
We want to have a role.

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
Tasha wants to build her roofs.

52:58.000 --> 53:01.000
All you want is a function

53:01.000 --> 53:04.000
and to know that you are,

53:04.000 --> 53:05.000
that you're nailing it,

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
that you're doing the most you can

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
and that if you're not succeeding

53:09.000 --> 53:10.000
as much as you can,

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
that you're still trying and getting better.

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
Everyone wants to feel that way all the time.

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
I don't think Keith Moon wanted to be a Roger D'Algerie.

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
I think Keith Moon liked being Keith Moon.

53:18.000 --> 53:21.000
You're just using examples that are...

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
But there's also like a garage band

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
that's just doing it for fun,

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
who's never going to, you know,

53:27.000 --> 53:28.000
want to do actual shows.

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
There's a couple bands like that, right?

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
There's like three, I think, three.

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
I don't want to be Dan.

53:34.000 --> 53:38.000
I know that without trying to go to the crowd,

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
I know there are musicians here

53:40.000 --> 53:43.000
that would be happily, never the lead singer.

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
We're talking in circles.

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
I've circumscribed this whole thing

53:47.000 --> 53:50.000
and I'm smarter than everyone in the world.

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
Like, I...

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
The way everyone here feels,

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
I already feel that way.

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
And more.

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
That's the bottom line.

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
I feel everything.

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
I know what it's like to be black.

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
It's hard.

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
But cool.

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
That track.

54:13.000 --> 54:14.000
Salty.

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
And a little sweet.

54:16.000 --> 54:19.000
Dan, okay, let's say that you were in the Philharmonic,

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
in a big orchestra.

54:21.000 --> 54:24.000
Where it's not about first chair,

54:24.000 --> 54:27.000
you can be first chair anything you want.

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
What instrument would you play if you could play anything?

54:29.000 --> 54:30.000
Tuba.

54:30.000 --> 54:31.000
Tuba?

54:31.000 --> 54:32.000
Yeah.

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
Tuba or Suzertham?

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
A suzertham!

54:36.000 --> 54:39.000
No, fuck you guys.

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
Straight up tuba.

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
Proper tuba.

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
Tuba snap.

54:45.000 --> 54:48.000
Yeah, because then you're in and out.

54:48.000 --> 54:49.000
Are you?

54:49.000 --> 54:52.000
Because how many songs have like a tuba solo?

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
You just show up and you're like,

54:54.000 --> 54:55.000
just be the best tuba player.

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
Tuba is like the bass player of the band.

54:57.000 --> 55:00.000
Yeah, so we're talking in circles here.

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
Like, I...

55:02.000 --> 55:03.000
You want to be a bass player?

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
There's no lead singer in a symphony.

55:05.000 --> 55:06.000
That's what I meant.

55:06.000 --> 55:07.000
There's no superstar.

55:07.000 --> 55:08.000
You answered my question.

55:08.000 --> 55:13.000
You would like to play a kind of not up front instrument.

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
It's a specific flavor,

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
because I would want to stand out.

55:17.000 --> 55:20.000
Hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope.

55:20.000 --> 55:21.000
Oh shit, keep it going.

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
There's the tuba.

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
Because if you were like the best violinist in the world,

55:25.000 --> 55:28.000
then your friend comes to see the concert and you get off stage

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
and they're like,

55:30.000 --> 55:31.000
good job.

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
And you're like, how do you know you dick?

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
You could eat violinists up there.

55:35.000 --> 55:38.000
All right, let's move on.

55:38.000 --> 55:41.000
Uh, but I don't have a favorite color.

55:41.000 --> 55:44.000
Are you asshole?

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
What are your top three? Top three?

55:46.000 --> 55:49.000
Uh, orange?

55:49.000 --> 55:50.000
All right.

55:50.000 --> 55:51.000
I love orange.

55:51.000 --> 55:55.000
Baby blue.

55:55.000 --> 55:56.000
Hiroshima.

55:56.000 --> 56:01.000
And AIDS yellow.

56:01.000 --> 56:05.000
Just fuck the queen.

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
Do you think I was just going to pander?

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
AIDS yellow.

56:09.000 --> 56:15.000
The color of AIDS.

56:15.000 --> 56:16.000
I went to Home Depot recently.

56:16.000 --> 56:20.000
It's hard to get a good AIDS yellow.

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
Jaundice AIDS.

56:22.000 --> 56:26.000
The color of your AIDS.

56:26.000 --> 56:27.000
Uh, statistically speaking,

56:27.000 --> 56:28.000
anyone with AIDS here tonight?

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
Of course, of course.

56:30.000 --> 56:31.000
Yes.

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
Uh, too soon.

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
Banana guy.

56:35.000 --> 56:38.000
The, uh...

56:38.000 --> 56:41.000
His banana is AIDS yellow.

56:41.000 --> 56:45.000
Uh...

56:45.000 --> 56:50.000
Banana guy's got AIDS.

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
Victor, do you have AIDS?

56:52.000 --> 56:53.000
No, okay.

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
He's clear. He's good.

56:55.000 --> 56:56.000
All right.

56:56.000 --> 56:59.000
So one of the things I like to do when I come to Comic-Con

56:59.000 --> 57:03.000
is hang out with my very, very, very old friend.

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
As old as the hills.

57:05.000 --> 57:08.000
Who's always here with a little flower on his head,

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
selling his little, his little trade paperbacks

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
from his Canadian cartoon, Bob the Angry Flower.

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
Are you talking about one of my favorite people in the world?

57:14.000 --> 57:15.000
Yeah.

57:15.000 --> 57:16.000
Steven Knottley is here.

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
Steven Knottley, Bob the Angry Flower.

57:18.000 --> 57:19.000
Are you going to come up, Steve?

57:19.000 --> 57:23.000
You don't have to.

57:23.000 --> 57:24.000
I love this guy.

57:24.000 --> 57:41.000
Hello, Steven. How are you, man?

57:41.000 --> 57:42.000
I'm okay here.

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
I thought you were kidding when you said you were going to do this.

57:44.000 --> 57:45.000
Do what?

57:45.000 --> 57:46.000
You didn't say it.

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
I thought you were kidding.

57:48.000 --> 57:49.000
All right.

57:49.000 --> 57:50.000
Holding it.

57:50.000 --> 57:51.000
If you don't know Steven Knottley,

57:51.000 --> 57:55.000
he writes a hilarious and poignant and trenchant little comic strip

57:55.000 --> 57:56.000
and ink and paper.

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
I use two of those words when I'm pitching.

57:58.000 --> 57:59.000
Is that right?

57:59.000 --> 58:00.000
I don't say poignant.

58:00.000 --> 58:01.000
But trenchant.

58:01.000 --> 58:02.000
Yes.

58:02.000 --> 58:03.000
Maybe salient.

58:03.000 --> 58:04.000
I do say salient.

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
It's called Bob the Angry Flower,

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
and it's great commentary.

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
It's quite wonderfully drawn.

58:10.000 --> 58:14.000
And it expresses all of your impotent rage

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
and righteous indignation.

58:16.000 --> 58:17.000
That's very cool.

58:17.000 --> 58:18.000
Yeah.

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
You're one of my oldest and nerdiest friends.

58:20.000 --> 58:23.000
If you combine the old and the nerdy,

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
you're definitely into one scale.

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
That's definitely your top of the list.

58:27.000 --> 58:30.000
If you sort by nerdy and oldy.

58:30.000 --> 58:33.000
Do you remember when you were sitting in my one bedroom apartment

58:33.000 --> 58:34.000
while I was writing Monster House,

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
and for some reason I had cocaine,

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
and we were trying cocaine.

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
I was writing Monster House.

58:40.000 --> 58:41.000
I do.

58:41.000 --> 58:42.000
I remember that.

58:42.000 --> 58:47.000
It had the tenor of a proto-Harmontown encounter

58:47.000 --> 58:50.000
where I was like, we don't really do cocaine here,

58:50.000 --> 58:54.000
but let's just do this anyway because I have some.

58:54.000 --> 58:55.000
I just had some.

58:55.000 --> 58:56.000
Because when I moved to LA,

58:56.000 --> 58:59.000
I found out you could just call someone and have it delivered.

58:59.000 --> 59:00.000
A choir of cocaine.

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
And that wasn't the gaze of Milwaukee.

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
So I was like, okay, I'll take some of that too.

59:04.000 --> 59:05.000
It's like cinnamon sticks.

59:05.000 --> 59:06.000
Yeah.

59:06.000 --> 59:09.000
And then it turns out cocaine is kind of a lot of fun.

59:09.000 --> 59:12.000
We got a lot of talking done about technology and stuff.

59:12.000 --> 59:16.000
And then you spend a lot of time doing stuff like this.

59:16.000 --> 59:17.000
Like very excitedly.

59:17.000 --> 59:18.000
Yeah.

59:18.000 --> 59:19.000
And then I tried to write Monster House,

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
and I was like, the house is a monster.

59:21.000 --> 59:24.000
And then that's why the third act is just like,

59:24.000 --> 59:27.000
let me find some dynamite.

59:27.000 --> 59:34.000
But I remember way back then you blew my mind with this concept.

59:34.000 --> 59:43.000
You introduced me to it, which is the idea that intelligence is a field

59:43.000 --> 59:47.000
that is the actual thing that is alive in the universe.

59:47.000 --> 59:51.000
And that DNA life itself is sort of a subset of that.

59:51.000 --> 59:54.000
Because there's an intelligence to the universe.

59:54.000 --> 59:59.000
Not intelligent design.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
That information.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.000
Let's say information, not intelligence.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Anybody have any coke?

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:12.000
That the idea is that genetically reproduced life is sort of the pawn in the game.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:17.000
The reason why there's living things on Earth,

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:23.000
eating each other, and evolving based on which person or thing it's eating,

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:28.000
is because overall there's just this drive by this field

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:31.000
that wants to continue to store more and more information.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.000
It's not even a field.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:36.000
I was sort of summarizing stuff that a guy named Robert Wright has written about.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:40.000
He's got a book called Non-Zero that he talks about this in great depth,

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:45.000
which is basically like there's zero-sum encounters.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:49.000
If you're playing tennis, if you win, then I lose. Zero-sum.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:54.000
But there are encounters in which there are non-zero-sum that both can win.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:58.000
And basically entropy is the bad side of it,

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
but the good side is you put energy in,

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:04.000
you can have things that both sides get more out of it.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
There's an entropy cost.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:11.000
But basically things become more complicated and glommed together,

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:14.000
and then those things become more complicated and glommed together.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:19.000
And that just happens, whether you're a quark, or an atom, or a molecule,

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:24.000
or a lobo, or a zip-head, or a lobo, or a dead pool, or a trank,

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:30.000
or a worm, or a person, or a corporation, or a human being,

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:35.000
or a robo-galactic mega-brain, or a flower.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:40.000
So the idea being that, as far as our position in this whole thing,

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:45.000
is that we are the pinnacle of genetic information evolution.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:51.000
We have chromosomes jammed into the cells of our body

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:57.000
that are so coiled up and so stuffed into each cell's nucleus

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:04.000
that the operation of them splitting takes this enormously complicated process

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:09.000
because it's just spools and spools and spools of molecular information.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:14.000
But the sum total of that is that we're these monkeys that have these brains,

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:20.000
and we're building these computers, and we're creating new ways to store information.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:23.000
And we seem to be doing it compulsively.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:28.000
Not all of those things make us better monkeys.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:35.000
We seem compelled to keep advancing our way of storing and transferring information,

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:40.000
sometimes directly in spite of what actually profits us as primates.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:45.000
And so it's almost as if we're being compelled by some horrible larger...

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:49.000
No, maybe not horrible, maybe wonderful, but certainly not a thing that's rooting for us.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:52.000
Something that's kind of like using us as a little slipper

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:55.000
that it's going to get tired of and step out of and move on from.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:59.000
Well, the way I would look at it is like, if you look at yourself,

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:03.000
you consider yourself to be a singular entity, right?

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
You are Dan Harmon.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:12.000
But at the same time, you are a corporation made up of trillions and trillions of cells that make up Dan Harmon.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
Thank you.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:18.000
And those cells are individual living beings.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:27.000
And there is a long history of those cells learning how to make up a corporation

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:32.000
of tens of trillions of trillions of cells that can actually work as a gigantic corporation,

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:38.000
all doing their little jobs, to be this thing that, on the level of a cell,

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:42.000
you could not imagine cells don't picture that the thing that they make up is conscious

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
in the way that they know.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:49.000
You know, if they're just like, well, here I am, a capillary cell, and I've got my buddies here.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:53.000
We're all sort of pasted together, and we see all the dudes go by and blah, blah, blah.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:59.000
Do you ever think about God? Do you ever think about there's a guy named Dan that we're all a part of?

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:05.000
And it's like, shut up and do your job, man. Like, process that oxygen.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
But you are that entity.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Right.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:11.000
And now we also make up other entities.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:14.000
We are parts of corporations. We're parts of nations.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:19.000
We do not think that the thing United States has an identity,

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:24.000
a sense of self in the way that we ourselves think that we have that.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
But why do we think that?

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:32.000
It's completely arbitrary that we, only we, this collection, this assemblage of matter and life,

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:39.000
have the capacity to have an identity, and none others do.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:44.000
I mean, what would this, what would the macro picture look like if we were all,

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:47.000
would it end at the outskirts of the Earth?

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Are we just stuck on this blue marble and like connecting with each other

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:57.000
and trying to form a multicellular organism on the planet that will then reproduce?

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:58.000
I hope so.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Or is it more sinister than that?

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:05.000
I hope so, and it is more sinister than that.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:10.000
Maybe there's another planet like many light years away that's having the same experience happen to it

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:16.000
and the actual overriding principle is that we're supposed to combine with that

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:20.000
and we have absolutely no say in where this goes.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:21.000
Who cares though, right?

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
I mean, I guess, well, no, we all care.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Everybody's got a stake in it.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:30.000
Not only every human being, but everything in the universe has a stake in its own existence.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:35.000
Like 5 million, 10 million years ago, there was no such thing as human beings.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:39.000
50 million years from now, they will look back and go,

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:46.000
oh, that's right, there's no such thing as some kind of Borg-like entity

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:50.000
that covers light years of space and time.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:53.000
How much time do you think we have as humans?

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:58.000
I'm going to defer to Dan on that one.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:02.000
Stephen, the joke with Dan and I when we meet Stephen is always,

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
what's currently your biggest concern?

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
And you, it's like super volcanoes.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
Oh, that's so old.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
What right now is your main?

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
Plastic bottles.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:13.000
Plastic bottles.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:14.000
That's the main thing?

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:15.000
Oh, yeah.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
I'm just terrified now.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:20.000
My biggest fear now, have you ever watched that Doomsday Preppers show?

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:23.000
You're more worried about plastic bottles than super volcanoes?

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:24.000
Yes.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Plastic bottles are pretty immediate, I would say.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Did you think they're immediate?

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:35.000
I hear that Tom Selleck was stealing water to water his avocado orchards.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
Stealing it from who?

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:40.000
From the city, no, the county of Ventura.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
That's where I hail from.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
He stole water?

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:48.000
Yeah, he hired people to collect water and then they brought it to his...

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:49.000
I read about that.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:50.000
That's some fucked up shit, man.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:53.000
I'd imagine they're watering his mustache though, you know.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:56.000
Does he sell avocados or does he just...

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
He eats an orchard or a farm or something.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
He loves guacamole.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
He has these parties where he's like...

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:08.000
If you haven't had Tom Selleck's guacamole, you have not had guacamole.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:15.000
I'll tell you, my big panic is not water bottles, although it sounds like I need to learn more about the immediacy of that.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:21.000
My new thing is, it's just economic collapse.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:31.000
It's just the idea that everything is based on this fake idea that something's worth something compared to something else,

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:39.000
and that if the American dollar was worth a dollar on Monday and then was worth 70 cents on Tuesday,

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:45.000
the six hours from then, there would be fires on the horizon like Blade Runner,

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:51.000
and six hours from that, cops would stop showing up for work because they'd be like, it's just on fire.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:56.000
And I'm going to go home and protect my family with my gun from work.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:03.000
And before I worry about something as cool as a super volcano, I actually...

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:04.000
Which is very cool.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:07.000
The cool thing to worry about, everybody, read about super volcanoes,

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:11.000
because I don't want to diss your concern about super volcanoes.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:14.000
They are a great way for humanity to be exterminated.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
The first one to lay this out, you were very...

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:21.000
About five years ago, you were very concerned about the super volcano under your somebody.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
And now, not so much.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
Yeah, I...

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:28.000
But I would agree with you, the economic problem is...

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:37.000
I want to build a big bomb shelter underground and just have water and shotguns and dogs.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:44.000
Just water and dogs, then everything else will be okay.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:48.000
Yeah, because I think you can milk dogs and live off of them.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
And feed the water.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
I'll have mice for the dogs to eat.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:56.000
I think if you could milk dogs, we would already have done that.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:00.000
If you could get a dog to milk another dog, we would have done that.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
But if you teach them to fish...

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:05.000
We really fucked dogs up. We fucked dogs up.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:10.000
In other words, we're close to the ideal and idealized economic metaphor.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:16.000
We're starting out as like, we live in a desert island and you get two coconuts and I catch one fish and we'll...

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
Yeah, we're all fucked up.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:22.000
But now that we've moved into dog water milking systems...

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:31.000
When you see a schnauzer, that's a regular dog whose limbs have been bred to be little flippers.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:35.000
But I do want to refer to what you were saying.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:40.000
The economic concern, which I would summarize as going, the problem being that even though everybody here...

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:43.000
We're all capitalists, right? Capitalism, yeah?

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
Yeah.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
Capitalism.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:50.000
Oh boo, also correct.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:53.000
Almost the same now because...

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:57.000
Any anarcho-cynicalists out there.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:01.000
But even the people who self-identify as capitalism...

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:07.000
What is capitalism? Is the understanding that capital plus labor equals wealth?

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:08.000
No.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:11.000
Well, no, it is. That's capital.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:16.000
Workers create wealth. Wealth is accumulated, that becomes capital.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:20.000
Land is capital. If I own a piece of land, that's capital.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:23.000
But I can't make it productive without workers.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:27.000
Workers create wealth, but capitalists own all the wealth.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
Exactly.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:35.000
Wait, I don't want to miss this point. I'm too stupid. Take me through this, like a children's book.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:40.000
Capital is the unpaid portion of labor.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:44.000
If surplus is the unpaid portion...

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:47.000
If everybody got paid for what their work was actually...

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:48.000
There would be no profit.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:49.000
There would be no capital.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:55.000
It's the part that you don't pay your laborers. To the extent that we don't pay our workers, that's capital.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:59.000
That's profit. I own something. I have property rights. I own it.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:04.000
Now my ownership of it does not allow it to become productive. I apply labor to it.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:07.000
I pay the laborers something less than I sell it for.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:13.000
The gap is my profit, which then I feed back into my additional capital.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:19.000
I become richer and richer, but then I also push forward the story, which is that, basically,

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:28.000
money and wealth is a function of owning and being rich, rather than no money is created by people who work.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:32.000
It's just that simple. Yet you don't really quite hear people go like,

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:38.000
oh, well, all these rich people... You don't want to take their value or their wealth.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:43.000
It's like, well, it is their wealth because they own the means of production,

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:48.000
but it's not like they made it. The people who made it made it.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:58.000
I think we can make this a little clearer for the common man, even though I understand it,

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:09.000
if I do it as a rap.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:20.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, capitalism. Yeah, it's forming a schism between the rich and the poor.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:31.000
It's like jism. Starting over. Yo, I fucked your mama. I fucked your mama.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:38.000
I fucked your mama so hard it hurt. I fucked your mama like my name was John Hurt.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:48.000
It's the same word. Sorry. Starting over. Yo, yo.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:55.000
A dollar's worth this. A dollar's worth that. I fucked your mama until she was blind as a bat.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:13:03.000
Flying around using sonar. I fucked your mama. I got a bonar. I put it inside her.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:10.000
She was like, that's quieter. Starting over. Starting over.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:17.000
Oh, you were doing a surplus value. Yo, what's up with that shirt?

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:22.000
Yo, are you going to work? Yo, what's up with your hair?

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:29.000
Yo, don't take the stairs. Starting over. Didn't work in the crowd. Didn't work either.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
Yo, yo.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:34.000
Jazz, jazz, jazz, jazz, capital.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
Rap, rap, rapity, rap.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:37.000
Rapitalism.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:42.000
I'm going to have a rap attack. I'm going to rap good. I'm going to rap good.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:50.000
I'm going to rap good and I'm rapping real good. Just starting over. Starting over.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:14:02.000
There are seven wonders of the world. This rapping is about to be worth it.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:07.000
Yo, I went out to the street. I needed some bread and I got some meat.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:13.000
It was on a protein diet, so I had the latter. I fucked your mama like she was pancake batter.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:20.000
I poured her pussy into a pan. I fucked her as hard as I can, but it wasn't hard enough,

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:26.000
so I got a new job sucking your dad's knob.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:30.000
I love your dad now. I love your dad now.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:31.000
Progressive.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
I love your dad now.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:34.000
Progressive.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:39.000
I love your dad now. Your dad made love to me.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:42.000
I fucked him so hard that I broke my knee.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:47.000
Don't fucking try to stop me. Try to shut me down.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:51.000
No, no. Just getting on a roll.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:54.000
Yo, yo, yo.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:57.000
I met your dad in the fall of 72.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:00.000
I fucked him so hard I lost one of my shoes.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:12.000
Where did it go?

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:15.000
There's a guy that's mad at the back now.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:23.000
Alright. 9-11.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:27.000
Alright, that didn't work. You can't force it.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:32.000
I think we've learned a lot about the nature of capitalism.

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:36.000
I hope so. I think, you know, there's 500 people here.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:54.000
Even if you force it.

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:59.000
Those of you who are only listening, Dan was presented by a hilarious gentleman

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:03.000
with a Bloody Mary with everything on top of it.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:06.000
A BLT's on it?

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:10.000
Did the people at Tin Roof make this or was this assembled by...

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:11.000
I don't know. Also, I wouldn't drink it.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:14.000
I think it was phoned in from Alaska.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:18.000
Nikki and Nicole made this out of the...

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
Thank you.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
Nikki and Nicole.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
Alright, so do they work here?

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
May I get a Fernette Bronco, by the chance?

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
Have you got a Fernette Bronco back there?

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:31.000
Upstairs? What's her name upstairs?

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
Upstairs. Can I get a Fernette Bronco?

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:36.000
Can we make a human chain and get me a Fernette Bronco?

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
So you're still on the Fernette?

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:43.000
I wondered if you'd moved on from there.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:46.000
Motherfucker. Cheeseburger. How is it?

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:51.000
This is the best Bloody Mary I've ever had in my life.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:56.000
Let's bring my soulmate up, Erin McGathy.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
You want to do a rap?

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
Rap it, rap it.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:15.000
Rap it out, rap it out.

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
Yours backstage for a long time.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:21.000
Waiting for a rock.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
Yeah, keep rapping.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:26.000
Brassist Park. Don't know if the bit went well.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:30.000
Was unceremoniously excused, but I can't walk in these shoes.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:34.000
Welcome to McGathey Tech.

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
This is McGathey Tech.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:40.000
My favorite color is red-orange.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:43.000
A favorite color just sounds like having a favorite movie.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
You just see it and you like it.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:48.000
When you see a favorite movie and you have a favorite movie,

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
it doesn't mean you want to live in it.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:53.000
You just like it more than the other movies.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
It's like having a favorite anything.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:56.000
Yeah, but...

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
Colors.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
Colors.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:05.000
White is all the colors together.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
Yes.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
Yeah.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
But...

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:18.000
Is Citizen Kane better or worse than Star Wars?

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:21.000
And that's like, oh, what's my favorite movie?

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
Well, okay, come on, you're racing.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:24.000
You're racing.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:27.000
You have favorite movies all the time and you have a favorite movie, too.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:35.000
That was Luke Skywalker losing his sled.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:42.000
We hadn't planned the end of that bit or any of that bit.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:46.000
I'll tell you, there are a few things that are then walking off the stage

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:50.000
in these shoes down that thing.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
Why is that sad?

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
Because I can't walk in these shoes.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:58.000
These are these crazy heels from that movie.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:02.000
And also no woman ever wants to be sent to her paddock.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:08.000
Even if she owns the paddocks, even if she drives, there are hers.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:09.000
Yes.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
All right, so how's it going?

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
Any complaints?

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
I rapped about the color thing.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:22.000
But seriously, you have a favorite color?

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:23.000
Yes, red orange.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
Red orange.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
Can't even pick.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:30.000
Not red and orange, but like a red orange.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:33.000
Okay, my favorite is blue, yellow, green.

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:36.000
I guess I'm better at it.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
So that's like a teal.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:39.000
Okay.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:42.000
It's more like double green, isn't it?

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
What's your favorite color, Spencer?

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
It's extra green.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
Yeah, just extra green.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
My favorite color is green.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:53.000
It's a good color.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
It's a funny thing to be mad about.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
I think you should let people do their own thing.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
I'm not telling them to do anything.

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:02.000
You're telling them to die because they like colors.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:05.000
I announced that I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:09.000
And they fucking, they rose up and they were like, finally, someone says it.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
Who has a favorite color?

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:14.000
They were like, finally, finally, the fucking.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:21.000
So here has a, who likes, who likes a color?

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:22.000
Thank you.

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:25.000
Who has a favorite one?

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:26.000
All right.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:27.000
Well, let's go.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:30.000
I'm going to, I wish we had a wireless mic because I just want to like,

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:34.000
I just want to run through and get everyone's favorite color.

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:37.000
Why would you stop people from that?

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:38.000
I don't want to.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:39.000
I want to, I want to celebrate it.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
You have lost, you have lost a cord there.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:42.000
I think you can probably roam.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
I don't think I can make it out there.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:45.000
Check it out.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
You have lots of cable there in front of you.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:48.000
Oh.

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:52.000
You're the one person I'm not going to ask.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:55.000
Now, Dan, you came down pretty hard on Bloody Mary.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:21:02.000
Navy blue is the Tim Allen of colors.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:03.000
Shit.

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:04.000
Harvard's full of protein.

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:07.000
Now he's going to fucking come right after you.

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:08.000
Don't die, Dan.

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:09.000
Where's the hamlet?

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:10.000
Are you choking?

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:17.000
I just inhaled a piece of burger.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:18.000
I'm fine.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:23.000
You know how when you, just a fleck of food goes into your lungs?

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:24.000
It's not going to kill me.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:31.000
It's just going to bum me out for the next hour.

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:32.000
See what?

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:35.000
They said you're great.

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:38.000
Davis and Gray, what?

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
That's a good color.

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
That's the Navy blue guy.

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:48.000
Why don't we do a rainbow prism from red to purple?

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:52.000
And you applaud for your favorite color.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
That's just the Navy blue guy.

01:21:54.000 --> 01:22:00.000
His favorite color is pandering.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:04.000
He's a fucking schmoo.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:09.000
Take over the show, I'm going to die.

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
You flew too close to the sun, Nicarus.

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:14.000
I inhaled a piece of...

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:19.000
The color wheel is horseshit because it's not a wheel.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:22.000
It starts at ultraviolet and goes to infrared.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:25.000
We just curl it up because we can't see anymore.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:30.000
Oh shit.

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:33.000
Science snap.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:34.000
You're all perceptive.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
You have to take over the show.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
I'm going to die.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
The guy who's telling you colors are bad

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
can't swallow properly.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
Which is something that babies can do.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
Also, you came out, you opened with

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
you hate buddy marriage with food in it.

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
Now it's going to kill you.

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:53.000
I like the food pipe.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
I explained something to you.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
Here's why you don't want food to drink.

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
You tried to drink your food.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:00.000
You can't drink food.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:03.000
You can't drink over 40 years.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:04.000
Here we go.

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
Starting at the top of the rainbow.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
Red.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
Orange.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
Yellow.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
Green.

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
Blue.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:19.000
Blue.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
Purple.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
Interesting.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:24.000
Smart crowd, right?

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
Because smart people are...

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
Black.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
This guy in the front row.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
I like Seafoam green once in a while.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
I like a nice Seafoam.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
These MC John shirts are all in Seafoam green.

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
Minty 90s color.

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
Black is the absolute ball color.

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
We're doing a different scale.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
Who loves black?

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
Jeff Davis suit gray.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
White.

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
Yeah.

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
Who hates all colors?

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
Monochrome.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
Grayscale.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
Grayscale.

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
I'm just warning you guys.

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
You kids.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
You're esophageal flap.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
You know how your toilet...

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
Some of you guys have apartments.

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
Have you had to fix your toilet?

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
Because there's a little flap that makes it sealed.

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
And then the tank can fill up with water.

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
You know how it rots away?

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
And you have to replace it.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
42.

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
Vodka.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
It doesn't seal all the way.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
So, I'm just warning you.

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
Drink smoothies.

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
Dan, have you ever hidden anything in your toilet tank?

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
Thanks, Steve.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
Oh, thank you, Steve.

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
Steve was one of the Raptors earlier.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
Can I have a sip of your bloody Mary?

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
Yeah.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
Oh, my God.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
What if that's how I had done?

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
Oh, man.

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
San Diego's my hometown.

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
It's nice to have you here.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
We're still living in Bankers Hill.

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
Hell?

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
Just keep going.

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
Do you have any friends here that want to talk about science or anything?

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
You okay, then?

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
No, I'm not.

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
But it's fine.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
I'm asking as a friend.

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
Take the show. I have to keep coughing up little tiny

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
molecules of burger.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
Because I inhaled

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
and it slid down

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
past the esophageal flap.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
There's a little Han Solo

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
has invaded the Death Star of my body.

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
Wash it down with some bacon.

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
Was

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
anybody at the Star Wars

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
panel?

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
That must have been tremendous.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
Harrison Ford came out.

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
You weren't told that any of those people were going to show up, right?

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
Carrie Fisher showed up

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
and Harrison Ford showed up.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
And then JJ Abrams took them all out

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
like Andy Kaufman's style said,

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
we're all going to a concert.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
And then the San Diego Philharmonic

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
played Star Wars.

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
You went to my panel, thank you.

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
Where we had to try to do a Rick and Morty

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
table read under the fireworks

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
from JJ Abrams.

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
Didn't that help?

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
No, it was fine. It was great.

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
Have I ever met Kevin Smith?

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
His panel

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
was after the Star Wars

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
panel and so there was just

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
no one there.

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
I'm not laughing at his misfortune.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
Yeah, you are.

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
It's fine.

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
We all do.

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
He's fine.

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
He's Kevin Smith.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
Touchy points.

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
Dave Grohl and Kevin Smith for these guys.

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
I think that was Kurt Cobain though.

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
It was Kurt Cobain they were reacting to.

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
Everyone loves that guy for some reason.

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
Was Dave Grohl here?

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
No.

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
I was at a bar with

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
in New York.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
Dave Grohl had just played food fighters

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
at a bar and he comes down

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
and he had just played

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
for fucking three hours.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
He's an indefatigable on stage

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
and he had diapers with him.

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
He's holding a bag of diapers.

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
I said, do you have a baby

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
or are you just really eccentric?

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
He goes, oh shit man.

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
I wish I was an eccentric.

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
I got a baby.

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
He puts one on in the middle of a guitar solo

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
that takes so long and eats a piece of pizza

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
and doesn't stop until he shits it out.

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
What about the animator

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
who created Bugs Bunny?

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
Tex Avery.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
Tex Avery was such a workaholic

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
and so dedicated to his work

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
that he would push his bladder

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
so far when he was working

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
and he wouldn't want to get up

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
and go to the bathroom.

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
It was like a thing about him until one day

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
his bladder burst.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
It was working so hard.

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
When it went goooogah.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
That's poop doc.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
I still have half a hamburger lodged

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
right on the lip of my esophagus.

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
He goes back from that and goes like

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
what classic Bugs Bunny cartoon

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
did that incident inspire?

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
I think that's one of the good ones.

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
What's opera doc?

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
What's opera doc is the best one?

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
Probably that one.

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
You can tell how much money they spent

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
on Looney Tunes cartoons

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
by how many whiskers are on Bugs Bunny

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
because it took longer

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
than any to track

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
the whiskers.

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
Comics, right?

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
Can I check in?

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
I don't know how much time we've done.

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
I black out at a certain point.

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
We started at 7.15.

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
We have about a half hour.

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
We'll check in with Spencer

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
for five to seven minutes.

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
How's your comic-con been?

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
It's been pretty good.

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
I found out that

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
that health app on your iPhone

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
is just constantly tracking you

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
without you telling it to.

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
Can you get a message on your phone

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
that just said stop?

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
Your heart is about to give out.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
It's really helpful.

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
It's going to save lives.

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
The iWatch in stores now.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
Anyway,

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
I've been walking

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
like 12 miles a day or something.

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
Because I was dead.

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
Just exhausted, man.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
Oh, yeah.

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
It's fun.

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
I lost my badge at some point.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
I heard that somebody snarfed it

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
off of you New Orleans style.

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
It could have been that,

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
or it could have just been caught

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
by an errant wind or something.

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
It was around your neck.

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
It might have been the Notorious San Diego Badge Snarfer.

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
That's what I was thinking.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
They're really expensive.

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
It's kind of the equivalent

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
of picking so much pocket.

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
With petty thievery going on,

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
there would be like a multitude

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
of spider men to show up

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
and stop that happening.

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
Do you think it's possible

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
for somebody to get that close to you

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
and actually unclip

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
the thing from the land years?

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
I think that's not what happened,

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
but it's absolutely possible.

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
What do you think happened?

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
I think probably I brushed by someone

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
who did the clasp and declasped it

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
and it like fell fluttered to the floor

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
and then someone picked it up right after.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
How many of those God people are for real?

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
I can't tell the difference between the...

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
Here's the thing.

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
A lot of people are actively antagonizing them

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
and it's like, why are you better?

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
Just because you're against them?

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
I don't know. There's this guy

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
that was yelling at him to suck his balls

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
and that they were going to hell

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
if they didn't suck his balls.

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
Now there's just two people being annoying.

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
I don't...

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
That's not what I want.

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
Everyone enjoys the con

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
in their own way.

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
I'm a firm believer

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
and if someone else starts it,

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
you get to finish it though.

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
Not that that finishes it.

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
I think that the Christian people should

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
talk about how much they repent

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
every day if they're going to be telling

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
other people to repent all the time.

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
What if you guys found out

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
there's a graphic novel about

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
religious protesters

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
and that those people were doing

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
the most extravagant

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
cosplay ever and they were just like

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
in deep...

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
It has happened, we were talking about this,

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
that there was a video game that was coming out

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
and they did guerrilla marketing where they had

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
a group of people pretending to be Christian

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
protesters of this game

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
and it broke that they...

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
It was fake.

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
That they had posed as...

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
a group of people picketing the game

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
and then for some reason

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000
people got mad about that.

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
I'm not sure the 15-year-old

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
version of me would get mad at that.

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
I would be like, well that's cool.

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
Like pretending to be protesters?

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
I think that's a little weak.

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
I'm not sure why.

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
I don't know who it's hurting.

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
Because it's making fun

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
of people who are

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
just kind of sad already

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
and...

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
I guess you could get mad, but I don't think

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
the people that were getting mad, I think they were

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
just video gamers that were like

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
you shouldn't try to manipulate me.

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
What? I sell you video games.

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
Manipulate you for a living.

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
I convince you you're a space man.

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
Okay, let me move it this way.

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
Supposing you went around and your

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
cosplay was like video game nerd

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
and you built yourself a fat suit

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
and you covered yourself with Cheetos

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
and you became this like

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
awful entity, like would that be

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
good?

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
In order to evangelize the message of...

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
Well, you would be

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
kind of

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
incarnating our picture

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
of this without really...

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
I gotta say as long as you're not blocking traffic

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
I don't mind any of that because it does it

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000
as long as you're not obstructing

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
anyone from doing what they want

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
if all you're doing is sending messages

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
out into the ether, if those messages are dishonest

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
then hopefully the message you could draw

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
from that is, oh I should

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
have less stock in things strangers

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
tell me.

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
I think that's a good way

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
to grow up as a kid.

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
I don't know what that guy's jam is.

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
He's pretending to...

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
He's dressed like a banana but he could be a hitman.

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
Well, I know those people write a

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
comic where God is

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
the hero. Oh, they do.

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
And they're amazing.

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
They write lots of comics. They have bands.

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
They have radio stations.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
Yeah, those people

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
I just want to be argued with.

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
I, against my parents' wishes when I was

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
12 years old, joined

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
in San Diego an evangelist

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
youth group where

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
at the end of the first meeting they're like,

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
okay, you're new here. Hear a bunch of

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
booklets. It's really, really cool

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
to witness to people. So just tell us

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
how many people you've witnessed to.

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
I'm a really competitive person and I was like, okay,

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
is there some sort of game with how many people

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
I can get in heaven? I can get more people in heaven

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
than that guy.

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
The next week you came back to the youth group

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
and everyone would be like, well, I was in an elevator

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
and I

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000
stopped the elevator and I scared a guy

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
told him

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
we're all going to die and then I gave him

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
a booklet and I was like, he's going to come to church.

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
All these tricky

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
stories.

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
And the dumb

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
joke is, is there an app for that?

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
But there must be apps for that.

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
There must be Christian

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
groups making apps for

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
witnessing going, okay, like here,

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
tap this in.

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
Yeah, those people with the signs

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
don't, the thing that makes me mad

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
about it, I was brought up Christian and my dad's

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
a preacher and I'm not a practicing Christian

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
but I wouldn't know, I don't know

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
anybody ever in the history of my life that

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
would do that stuff. That's obviously about

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
getting people angry at you.

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
No one walks by a sign that says

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
you're going to hell and says like, oh cool,

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
tell me more.

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
You never see him succeeding.

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
There's never anyone stopping

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
like, yeah man. It's a weird thing from a

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
logical perspective, if you were an evangelical

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
Christian, why would you

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
go to the place where

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
60,000

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
people were doing what they shouldn't do?

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
Why not go to some place where there's like

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
300 people doing the worst thing ever?

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
Go solve murders.

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
We caught you, you murdered,

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
Jesus wouldn't do that and you could actually

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
help the police. Well they're trying,

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
it's exposure, it's like

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
they're trying to spread a disease. They're promoting

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
a product, they're selling a comic book.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
Yeah, it's that the product is,

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
in their minds, not going to

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
hell, which is a pretty good product

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
to pitch. It's catchy.

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
The one they really believe in.

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
Yeah, that's the thing, it's like

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
to them it's literally the most important

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
thing in the universe, which I mean, if it

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
were true, makes sense.

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
And then when you listen to what they're saying

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
through the bullhards, they sound like the dumbest people in the world

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
because they're going like,

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
do you believe in a guy with a cape

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
that's going to solve your problems?

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
Everyone's like, no, I don't believe

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
in a guy with a cape.

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
Do you believe in the gospel of Gandalf?

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
I have a job, I work in Verizon,

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
I don't fucking like, what, I

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
compartmentalize, like, are you crazy?

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
I'm spending a lot of

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
money here, I saved up my vacation

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
days, what are you, this isn't

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
this isn't fucking Mount Sinai,

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
what do you think I'm doing?

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
I'm dressed as a Cylon, I fucking enjoying

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
myself. I'm doing this

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
instead of rape.

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
I'm doing this

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
instead of murder, I'm doing this

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
instead of ox coveting, I'm doing this

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
instead of theft, I'm doing this

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
instead of almost all ten things

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
your god says I shouldn't do.

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
It's not, because it's not real of Angelism,

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
it's just, it's kooky. I went

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
to a Miley Cyrus concert

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
a year ago

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
in Los Angeles,

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
no need to do, but I was at

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
this concert, and those people

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
were there, and then their sides

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
were like, Miley is telling girls

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
to be prostitutes, and all these, you

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
know, it's a bunch of 15 year old girls

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
at this concert, were standing on a balcony

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
flashing these

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
guys for hours, to the extent that I was

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
like, oh, the way you see

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
young tits is to show

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
the sign at this concert,

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
it was awful. I'm sorry I just said the word tits,

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
I don't even ever say it.

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
You said young tits, that's much more marketable.

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
But also, young tits is a

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
really great name for an all girl punk band.

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
If anybody needs

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
a bassist, that's all I want to do.

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000
Great name for an album

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
or a band or a child.

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
We're giving free copies of our zine, young tits

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
at the door.

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
I have one more question about these guys

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
with the signs. Why are they

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
always on the other side

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
of the railroad tracks from the convention center?

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
Do they, do they, I would assume

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
that they would have no compunctions about getting

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
right up in the convention center.

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
I think they want to keep it moving the closer.

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
I mean, right outside

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
the Marriott marquee, there's people.

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
So it's like they are on the periphery.

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
It seems like they're trying to get close.

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
But do you think people are preventing them from

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
being close? Do they zap them with? I think if they were standing

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
still that whole time, yeah, they'd be like

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000
keep it moving or something. But I did see

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
some folks with their signs

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
right on the, right

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
outside the front of the convention center.

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
Yeah, right by the Marriott. They have one badge that they keep

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
swapping.

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
It just says Jesus. It's sort of weird because

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
I was like, well, what sin

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
do you guys think all these

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
people here are committing? They're starting

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
in the wrong place.

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
Yeah, they start with repent

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
which is very accusatory.

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
I mean, it's easy target

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
some kid that's dressed as poison ivy.

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
It's like, shame on you. You're a

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
terrible person. Well, it doesn't have to

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
be shame. It's like, hey man,

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
free prizes in heaven.

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
You know, that would

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000
work. Stan, get early

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
in line for God. Yeah, there's

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
no waiting in line

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
to get to the kingdom of Lord.

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
Unless I'm mistaken, and I've been coming

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000
here for, I've seen them like five years

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
in a row. Unless I'm mistaken, that's not the messaging

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
on their advertising. That's what's confusing. They're not

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
saying have a good comic con, but

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
get it out of your system and then we'd

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
like to talk to you about a real

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
superhero. That would be cool.

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
That would work. They're saying

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
congratulations

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
of driving here from Phoenix. Stop

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
right now!

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
Phoenix!

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
Where is the scriptural

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
basis for their objection?

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
It's like, where in the Bible

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
says... It's not real Christians.

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
Don't dress up in a costume.

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
I'm sure there's some people in this audience who are Christian.

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
That's not anything that you would ever do.

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
Is that a dot we're connecting?

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
Why are you worried that Christianity is going to be betrayed?

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
We're talking about those seven yahos.

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
We're not talking about Christianity.

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
They're not saying comics are evil. They're saying

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
everyone's going to hell because you're not

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
safe. We're talking about those people.

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
I've never heard one say you're

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
going to hell because of comics.

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
I've never heard them say that. They might,

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
but I've never heard it. Well, I've heard them

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
kind of like, kind of protest.

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
Comics lead you into witchcraft and

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
that's the scriptural

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
doctrinal line, right?

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
What I heard when I

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
stopped to listen was

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
actually like, they said you guys are

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
worshiping

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
characters that have

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
superpowers and

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000
Jesus is the only one that should have

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
superpowers. That's an old school craziness.

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
It's sort of like, now she'll not have

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
any more gods above our god.

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
And it's like, wait, are you saying

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
that your god is a story?

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
No, they're saying he's not.

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
And if you make up stories about

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
people that can do magic tricks.

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
I'm making up stories. We should play some

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
of that.

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
Well, Jesus will be played by

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
Spencer Crittenden.

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
Can we pretend my character inhaled

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
meatball?

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
Also, you never had a drink of that bloody

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
Mary. You only ate the...

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
I ate the fucking burger and then it was

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
just one moment where I was like, I just

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
took a breath because I was going to go out

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
and talk to people about their favorite color.

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
It ruined my night.

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
I'm on the recoup now.

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000
I can't believe somebody had the terrible

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
instinct of giving me a whole bottle of

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000
when I brought you up on stage.

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
Who wants something? Is that legal?

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
I know it's illegal.

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
Oh, by the way, have we

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
praised this venue? I think

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
Jeff did. The tin roof is

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
the tin roof!

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
We booked this place

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
very late in the game and

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
they were so accommodating

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
and the

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
room fit us all and they've been very

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
gracious and there were

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
four bottles of kettle in the green room

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000
and

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
they're just nice and professional

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
and wonderful.

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
Food on top of that.

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
Maybe we can do this thing every year or

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000
something for a Comic-Con.

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
And they get to Elizabeth and Steve

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
that were raptors and are also selling

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
merch over here.

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
Thank you.

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
Let's hear it for the area of the

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
electromagnetic spectrum that you guys

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000
cheered the most for. Greenish!

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000
With a slight nod to purple.

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
I don't like those people with signs

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
but with colors.

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000
How dare you!

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
If you like something reflecting into your eye

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
why don't you like purple?

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:10.000
Why red?

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000
Oh god, this is how we die.

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000
Oh no, it's okay, sorry.

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
If you really believe in this color

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000
can you hold up something that

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
is that color?

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
Right, like is your favorite color

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
do you wear that color?

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
If my favorite color is red, really prove it.

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
Show me something red.

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
We didn't solve it. Colors are dumb

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
and having a favorite one is dumb.

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000
Fair enough.

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
I'm not right.

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
You have a favorite food

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
that doesn't mean you necessarily eat it

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
all the time or a favorite movie.

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
If you're talking about macaroni and cheese

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
that is what it means.

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
You could shoot me

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000
into space in a bowl of macaroni

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
and cheese and I would never

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000
go where's the pizza?

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.000
I think the most important thing is

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
exploring why you're so

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
angry that people have a favorite thing

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
that you don't understand.

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000
I'm autistic.

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
There we go.

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
It's not easy.

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000
No, no, come on, come on, come on.

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000
What?

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000
So angry that people have a favorite

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000
thing?

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000
I think they're lying. It doesn't make

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000
any sense. It doesn't mean anything.

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000
Also, you hate color as a principle.

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
You said you don't like colors.

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000
He hates colors because I love colors.

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
I do that to upset Aaron.

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000
He does it to make me sad.

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
The truth is you can get

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000
all important information out of a

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000
black and white image.

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.000
I don't do that to you about things that you love.

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000
What if you tried?

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000
What would...

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000
Let's play Shadow Run.

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000
This is boring.

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
Hit the gas pedal.

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000
What character is Stephen playing?

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
Should it be Dr.

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000
Friend probably?

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
Let the dice fall where they may.

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
Do you follow the show at all, Stephen?

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
He's a huge fan.

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000
I would say...

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000
I would pitch that Stephen should be Dr.

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000
Friend, right?

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000
I don't care.

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
You're a troll doctor

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000
who doesn't harm,

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
but also is a very

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
complicated fellow.

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000
Do we have an extra?

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000
Yeah, we have a Demorige sheet, but...

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
We have a Demorige who plays

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
her told booby-doo.

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000
This guy's got a lot of friends pointing at him,

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000
so I guess we'll use him.

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
Yeah,

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000
no, over here, man.

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000
Oh yeah, yeah, sit here and use that mic.

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000
No, stand behind that bean.

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000
Earlier, I came to this venue at 4pm

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000
and all the great people who work here

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000
were like, okay, so you're banned?

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000
They put their equipment up like, oh no,

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000
it's a comedy show, and they're like,

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000
yeah, we don't really understand what it is.

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000
We've got mixed things.

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000
And then cut to this moment where we're passing out

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000
folders, and they're like, no, really not a band.

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000
Super not a band.

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000
Did I hear your friends calling you go-bot?

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000
No, it's Craig Knight.

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000
Craig Knight, sounds the same.

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000
You can call me go-bot, I don't care.

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
Alright, go-bot.

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
Thanks, Dan.

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
I'm not seeing alignment anywhere.

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
Oh yeah, Shadowrun doesn't have

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
alignment.

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000
This is in D&D, my friend.

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
It's a lot darker shades than that.

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
Sorry, Spencer, do we have a guest

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
intro person?

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000
Yeah, a guest known only

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
as Diego.

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
Diego, I love it.

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
He's the saint

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
of the city we're in.

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
Shall we rock and roll?

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
Yeah, let's rock and roll.

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000
Here we go.

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
Oh, yeah.

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000
Last time on Harmontown,

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000
Shadowrun.

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000
Facing the ethical dilemma posed by Jesse

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000
Yellowman, our Shadowrunners

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000
decided to look into Baldwin Brown's

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
research on BTL chips for themselves.

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
Horticard

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
insisted the files shouldn't be sent

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
over the Matrix and stuffed

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
tight up and twisted Jesse Yellowman

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
into the back of their Uber.

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
Joined by Hackeye at Hank's Last Stand,

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000
Mercy, Eve, and Horticard

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
uncovered the research,

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
showing that BTL chips can be used

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000
without addiction or harmful effects.

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000
Meanwhile, Jim Nightblade

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
discovered Dr. Friend's

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
increasingly hard feelings for

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000
his fellow. Will Dr.

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000
Friend's emotions go unrequited?

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000
Can Jim Nightblade keep the Troll's

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000
secret safe in a world

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000
where comlinks always seem to be on?

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000
Will Dr.

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000
Friend find agency in a world of

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000
hackers hooked on mountains of robocon

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000
cocaine with no consequences?

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000
We find out now

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000
on Harmontown, Shadow Town Harmon

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000
Run Comic-Con edition.

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000
Diego.

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000
Alright, so where are we?

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000
Yeah, thanks Diego.

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
Hank's Last Stand,

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
you, Jesse Yellowman,

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
he's trapped in the trunk of your Uber

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
which is idling outside.

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000
You are paying for that.

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000
It's reasonable though.

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000
So,

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
you're in Hank's Last Stand,

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000
you just, Hackeye just revealed

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
the data, it's about curing

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
the ill effects of BTL chip use.

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000
And that's what that data

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
you were searching for was. You still have it

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000
in your possession, you haven't turned it in yet.

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000
And that's what

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000
Balden Brown wants?

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000
That's what Balden Brown had

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000
and he would like it, yeah.

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
And we were wondering, do they want that information

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000
because they want to suppress it?

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000
Because they could make BTL chips healthy?

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000
Or,

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000
or do they want it so they could just sell BTL,

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000
a bunch of BTL chips?

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000
Or a different option.

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000
Uh-oh, oh shit.

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000
Oh no.

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000
Now, I say,

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
we vivisect him.

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
Uh, and just

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000
get what we can.

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
Vivisect who, doctor?

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000
Our, our, our, our tight up

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000
due to the back of our car.

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.000
You want to vivisect Jesse Elliman, the guy

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000
tied up in the trunk of the Uber right now?

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000
Yes.

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000
That seems like a very straightforward thing

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000
that a doctor would want to do.

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000
But what would the vivisection yield

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000
from him?

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000
Secrets?

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
I'm just pinning that.

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000
Fair, fair.

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000
Uh, hey, hack eye.

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000
Uh, yeah.

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000
What do you think a third possibility

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000
would be?

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.000
Oh man.

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.000
Well, what are the first two possibilities?

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.000
That the, that the, that our

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000
Johnson's, is that what they're called?

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000
Sure, yes.

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000
That our Johnson's.

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000
They mean good or they're trying to suppress it?

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000
That they want to make BTL chips

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
and sell a bunch of them?

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000
Or that they want to take the information

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000
and destroy it, like the tobacco companies?

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000
Those are two options.

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000
Right.

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000
Possible third, they don't want to use it.

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
They just want to sell it for higher value.

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
Sell the information?

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000
Yeah, fourth reason.

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000
Maybe, you know, they know something we don't.

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
Maybe they think that BTL chips

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000
aren't addictive enough or are too

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.000
addictive and want to change the nature of it.

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000
Maybe they're staging

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000
it, clamping down on this.

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000
Who knows, man?

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000
If they, if the corpse are involved,

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
who knows? You just got to get in there

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
yourselves. Which corporation

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000
makes the BTL chips? Do we know that?

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000
Oh man, everyone makes BTL chips.

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000
You could just make them, if you have one of your nano

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000
forges, you know, you can print them out at home.

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000
You can also just download them on iTunes.

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000
Why aren't we just making our own?

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000
What do you think? Is there anybody currently trying

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000
to kill us right now? Not at this

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000
moment that I am aware of.

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000
What do you think, Hordegaard?

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000
Let's see him at door.

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000
I think we should hack into the

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000
Matrix, because that's what I was told.

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000
Jesus Christ.

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000
Alright.

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000
Go by.

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.000
Well, you know, it seems like

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000
I know I keep going back and forth on this, but

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000
like,

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000
I don't know, we fucking, we shadow run.

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000
We work for evil corporations.

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000
Okay, we're shadow run.

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000
We're a group. No, but we're more than a group.

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000
Come on now.

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
We're a team.

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000
And we know each other. We've worked together

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000
so much. It's time for us to get together

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000
and then look to our leader.

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000
I think,

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000
I feel like I keep,

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.000
I keep what? Rescue him.

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000
He's in the trunk.

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000
Everyone's a dipshit tonight.

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000
Oh, oh, rescue him from,

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000
yeah, but we'll just open the trunk, dude.

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000
But if every mission we go on, I know

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000
I said the opposite last time,

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000
but Jesus Christ.

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000
I'm really conflicted.

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.000
Is Baldwin Brown with us in the bar right now?

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000
No, Baldwin Brown is at the place you

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.000
delivered him to.

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.000
Why don't we, I just, can we vivisect

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000
somebody?

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.000
We got to do that later.

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000
I'll offer myself.

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000
Just for interest.

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.000
I order a drink from the bar.

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.000
So Baldwin Brown is not at the bar we're at.

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.000
Wait, what do you order?

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.000
I order a,

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000
but no.

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000
I order a

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.000
scotch on a rock.

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.000
A single rock.

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000
All right. It arrives.

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000
Thank you.

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
What's your story?

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000
I'm Hank.

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000
My story is that I always wanted to

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.000
own a bar and then I did.

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.000
And then all this future

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.000
crazy dystopia shit happened.

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000
And now my bar is in a

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000
terrible part of town.

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000
So I pretty much only cater to outlaws

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000
and ne'er-do-wells.

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000
Boy, Hank,

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000
uh,

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
I'm just, first of all

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:14.000
I love the name Hank.

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.000
Hank, you must see a lot of shady stuff.

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.000
Oh, yeah, but, you know,

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000
I don't like mentioning it because

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000
that'll get us all killed.

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000
So put it back in your pants.

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000
Can we get on with the,

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000
I say, okay,

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000
this is the mood I'm in.

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000
Was my ordering a drink worse than

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000
vivisecting the person in the truck?

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.000
No, there's no competition.

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.000
If you're competing with him, you're in a fucked up place.

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000
Then we both, then everyone is lost.

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000
So you can't hear me or in the car?

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000
I'm standing here with my ear to your mouth.

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000
You don't know that.

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:48.000
I say,

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000
we take yellow

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.000
pinkerman and

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000
we take him to the Johnson.

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000
We give him everything and we fucking walk away.

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.000
With a big score.

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:00.000
We're shadow runners.

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.000
You know, I gotta like that.

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.000
Nightblade, I say we do that

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000
and we walk away

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000
unless the washer hands are this whole shop.

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000
And go on our next shadow run.

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.000
Because I don't think

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000
there'll be any repercussions.

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:16.000
I don't think this will be a cliffhanger.

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000
I don't think this will ever come back to haunt us.

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.000
I think we just do our job

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:22.000
get paid

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:24.000
and mo money

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.000
mo problems.

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.000
Alright, let's do it.

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:30.000
Let's get back in the Uber.

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:32.000
Let's take our bounty back to the thing.

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.000
We'll probably get a bonus.

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.000
Of course. I mean, Mercy,

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:38.000
when we get there, negotiate the fuck out of this

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.000
and give us some extra money on this one.

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:42.000
Yeah, yeah, I'm revving up.

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.000
Alright, all on the Uber, everyone in.

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000
We got everybody?

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.000
There we go.

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.000
You're at the neutral drop zone.

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.000
Animation zone.

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:02.000
You're at the neutral

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000
drop zone, the same place where you delivered

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000
Baldwin Brown to his truck bound

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.000
captors. It's an old

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.000
truck lot in a shitty part of town

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.000
across from all sorts of

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.000
devastated warehouse and broken down

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:16.000
clinics and all sorts of buildings

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:18.000
that used to house stuff and now only

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:20.000
mostly house monsters and ghouls

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000
and all sorts of

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.000
uncouth shit.

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.000
So there you are.

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:28.000
You pull into the parking lot,

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.000
which is the neutral drop zone.

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.000
And once again, you see a trollish

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:34.000
businessman, an orcish businessman

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.000
in a business suit

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.000
sitting in a semi-truck.

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:40.000
The lights turn on and he exits

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:42.000
the truck and walks over to you guys.

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.000
You may do all the talking.

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:46.000
Okay.

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:48.000
That's how I walk.

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.000
Hi!

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.000
Hey there!

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.000
Hello, here, I'm sorry.

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000
Hold on one second. I walk back to my crew.

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:00.000
What am I doing?

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.000
Tell them we got the files they wanted

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.000
and also we got a bonus for them,

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:06.000
which is willing to pay.

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:08.000
But don't tell them he's in the trunk.

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.000
The eagles in the bird catch.

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.000
That's a good price for Jesse Yellowman.

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:14.000
But don't tell him he's in the trunk.

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.000
Okay, cool.

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.000
Hey!

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.000
Hey!

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.000
I mean hey!

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.000
So I have some files

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:26.000
that I know you want.

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.000
Yes I do!

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:30.000
Alright.

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.000
What are you willing to give me for these files?

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.000
The agreed upon amount.

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.000
I don't know.

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:38.000
I'm going to say we want a little bit

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000
more because I know

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:42.000
a certain someone

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.000
hold on a second.

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:48.000
Jesse Yellowman.

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000
The agreed upon price is fine

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:58.000
but we'd like a bonus

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.000
for you.

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:02.000
You know, I mean here's the thing.

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.000
I promise I'm listening.

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.000
But then I just forget.

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:08.000
Got it.

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:10.000
Okay.

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:12.000
Let's just take the money.

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.000
That amount

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:18.000
that you have is great.

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.000
But you know we've done an extra great job

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.000
and similar to when you would go to a fancy restaurant

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.000
and someone treated you extra special

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:26.000
we just like

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.000
a little bonus.

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:30.000
In what way have you done an extra great job?

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.000
Well, we can't reveal that.

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:36.000
Oh!

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:38.000
I use

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:40.000
oh, I have a jammer?

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:42.000
Okay, anyway.

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.000
I use

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.000
my power. I use con

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000
and

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.000
negotiation.

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000
Okay.

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000
Look.

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.000
We know where Jesse

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:58.000
Yellowman is.

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.000
Right.

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000
I mean obviously it's Jesse Pinkman

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:04.000
from Dancing Ground.

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:06.000
Sorry.

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:08.000
We know where Jesse Yellowman is.

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:10.000
Who's that?

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:12.000
Well,

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:14.000
he's someone who's very valuable to you.

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:16.000
I'm using negotiation.

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.000
He's someone who's very, very important

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.000
to your operation.

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000
And we just want...

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.000
It's 9-11!

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:26.000
It's

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.000
apparently 9-11

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.000
and are

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.000
a

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.000
corrupted audience

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.000
that

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.000
celebrates it on their own.

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:40.000
For the

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000
most important

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:44.000
date in all

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.000
our history

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:48.000
and old

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:50.000
Langzine. Okay.

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:52.000
We did it.

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:54.000
Look, we want to...

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.000
Hold on a second. Foot, foot, foot, foot.

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:58.000
How much of a bonus?

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:00.000
I mean, is this just an emotional bonus?

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:02.000
Do we need this? No, we need this.

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:04.000
Can we actually close the deal?

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.000
Wrap up this thing.

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:08.000
It's a guy you have like...

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.000
Throw a couple extra clams

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.000
our way and see if he says yes.

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.000
It's a guy that

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:16.000
Billy Baldwin cares about.

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:18.000
Right, right, right. Foot, foot, foot, foot.

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.000
Look, we just want a little extra money.

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.000
You're good people. We're good people.

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:26.000
Let's do this.

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.000
Throw us some money.

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.000
And this will

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:32.000
all make sense. We know a young

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:34.000
man who Mr.

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:36.000
BB is very

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:38.000
crazy about

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:40.000
and we know where he is

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.000
and it would be in your best interest to

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:44.000
just throw us some money

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:46.000
and we'll shake hands and

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:48.000
look at these eyes.

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:50.000
That sounds... And tell

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:52.000
him that we have a secret

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.000
that he might want to give us a little bit more.

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:56.000
You don't think that that was implied

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.000
and what I said?

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:00.000
But another secret.

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:02.000
Okay, also we have another secret.

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:04.000
One more secret.

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.000
Well, that just seems excessive.

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.000
Just to throw it on the pile,

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.000
but secrets, you know,

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.000
six secrets

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000
per 100 gold coins.

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.000
Cool.

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:18.000
Your secret metric is off.

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.000
Yeah, we have another secret. Also,

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:24.000
I have some secrets.

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:26.000
Jesus Christ.

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.000
Just...

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.000
What do you say? I say

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:32.000
15% more

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.000
than the originally agreed-upron

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.000
price. Thank you.

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:38.000
Take it out.

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:40.000
We did it, we did it.

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:42.000
She drives a hard bargain.

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:44.000
Where is this fellow?

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.000
He's...

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:50.000
Well, wait here.

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.000
Okay. Turn around.

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:54.000
Okay. I want you to face the other way.

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:56.000
That's the way we do things. It's our signature.

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:58.000
It's totally fine. Don't attack me.

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:00.000
No, no, of course not.

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.000
I haven't even new money.

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:04.000
I say, when it turns around, we all take our pants down.

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:06.000
And when it turns around,

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.000
we just go, we're just fucking with you.

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:10.000
I open the trunk

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:12.000
of the Uber.

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.000
Just the element pops out,

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:16.000
blinking in the evening light.

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:18.000
Surprise!

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:20.000
Uh...

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.000
I haul him over to the...

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.000
to the Johnson.

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:26.000
And I pull, I pulled

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:28.000
just yell him in by the collar, and I lean in

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.000
and I say, look,

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:32.000
you tell them that you were in the trunk,

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:34.000
bad things are going to happen to you.

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:36.000
It doesn't matter now.

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:38.000
That's the...

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:40.000
The only point of that is just so they don't...

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.000
Just let me follow my own bliss. I just wanted to do that.

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:46.000
I'm not a very strong person.

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:48.000
I'm just a talker.

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:50.000
Bad things will happen to you.

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:54.000
When I...

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:56.000
say goodbye.

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:58.000
I feel like bad things will happen to me

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:00.000
now that I'm being sold

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000
to a businessman.

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.000
Baby, baby, baby.

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:06.000
Don't think of it that way.

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:08.000
Okay.

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:10.000
Look, at any given time,

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:12.000
we're all commerce.

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:14.000
We're all bartered.

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:16.000
You know, it's...

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:18.000
So, what are you guys going to do with

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:20.000
these files?

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.000
Oh, we're going to...

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:24.000
We're going to put them to good use.

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:26.000
We've got big designs

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:28.000
for our new sales force.

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:30.000
Do you guys want to go bowling?

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.000
Here we go, babe.

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:36.000
I'm never bowling. I say we do it.

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:38.000
Wait, you've never

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:40.000
bowled?

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:42.000
No, I've bowled before.

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:44.000
No, I said I'm down to bowling.

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:46.000
Oh, you're down to... I'm so sorry. Let's go bowling.

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:48.000
No, it's cool. Let's go bowling, yeah.

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:50.000
Can we get paid?

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:52.000
Well, you seem to be occupied

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:54.000
in other tasks.

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:56.000
Oh, no, we haven't been paid yet?

02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:58.000
No. You said 50% on top of what we're...

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:00.000
I did not. I said 15%

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:02.000
very explicitly.

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:04.000
All right, I put out my hand

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:06.000
to accept the appropriate amount

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:08.000
of payment. He shoves a large

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:10.000
silvered briefcase heavy

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:12.000
with bills into your hands.

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.000
What? Paper money?

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:18.000
Are you effing

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:20.000
serious?

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:22.000
Oh, shit, Dr. Friend.

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:24.000
It's cool. It's cool.

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:26.000
It's money.

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:28.000
This is the wrong time to be on your weird paper money thing.

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:30.000
But I tell you

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:32.000
the use of paper

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:34.000
money will be the death of the feudalist system

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:36.000
that we all rely upon.

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:38.000
After handing

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.000
you the suitcase

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:42.000
the Johnson pulls out a pistol

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:44.000
and shoots Jesse Yellowman

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:46.000
in the face.

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:50.000
Oh, shit.

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:52.000
Oh, shit.

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:54.000
I guess we had to know

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:56.000
that was a possibility.

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:58.000
I think that blood is

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:00.000
literally on our hands

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:02.000
and faces. Yeah, it's all over.

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:04.000
And pants.

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:06.000
Nice to in business with you.

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:08.000
I've got a truck stop to attend.

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:10.000
He pulls into his truck.

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:12.000
That was worth 15%.

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:16.000
Jesus. You are cold.

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:18.000
Our NPC

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:20.000
contact in this adventure.

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:22.000
You are a very cool person.

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:24.000
Yes. Yes.

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:26.000
So he leaves.

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:28.000
We're all splattered with Jesse Yellowman's blood.

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:30.000
We're at Hank's last stand.

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:32.000
And you hear the suitcase start to beep.

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:34.000
Oh, shit.

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:36.000
Now I really need a drink.

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:38.000
Cliff Hanger.

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:40.000
What?

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:42.000
That's...

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:46.000
Stephen Natalie, everybody.

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.000
Erin McGathy.

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:54.000
What's that guy's name?

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:56.000
Who is that guy? Thank you very much.

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:58.000
What?

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:00.000
Oh.

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:02.000
What's your name?

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:04.000
Craig.

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:06.000
It's Craig Knight.

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:08.000
Fuck it.

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:10.000
Spencer Crittenden did it, everybody.

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:12.000
Still something, Craig Knight?

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:14.000
I'm Jeff Davis.

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:16.000
Your mayor is Dan Harmon.

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:22.000
This show is brought to you by

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.000
whoever gave me this bottle of Frenette Bronco.

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:26.000
Frenette Bronco.

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:28.000
All right, San Diego, drive fast.

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:30.000
Take chances.

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:38.000
Did you get any of that?

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:54.000
It's a good show.
