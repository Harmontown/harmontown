{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:15.000\nWelcome, one and all, to San Diego, California, Comic-Con!\n\n00:15.000 --> 00:20.000\nAt the Tin Ruf?\n\n00:20.000 --> 00:23.000\nI've never been to Tin Ruf, this place is all right.\n\n00:23.000 --> 00:26.000\nWe're packed from floor to rasters here.\n\n00:26.000 --> 00:42.000\nLet's start off by welcoming the Game Master to the stars, Mr. Spencer Crittenden.\n\n00:42.000 --> 00:55.000\nAnd of course, the Mayor of Harmon Tap, the Mayor.\n\n00:55.000 --> 01:00.000\nHi, I'm sorry, please stop the music, please stop the music, please stop the music.\n\n01:00.000 --> 01:14.000\nHi, hello, hi everyone, don't be alarmed. There's been a slight security breach, but we want everyone to have a very good time.\n\n01:14.000 --> 01:23.000\nThere's been a vulnerability in the paddock, in several paddocks, all the paddocks are very vulnerable.\n\n01:23.000 --> 01:34.000\nBut if you could please just calm down, I'm slightly, there are raptors.\n\n01:34.000 --> 01:41.000\nBut it's fine, just don't move, they can't see you if you don't move.\n\n01:41.000 --> 01:44.000\nI thought that was T-Rex.\n\n01:44.000 --> 01:48.000\nNo, it's all of them.\n\n01:48.000 --> 01:52.000\nHoly shit, there's lots of raptors in the paddock. Are we in the paddock?\n\n01:52.000 --> 01:54.000\nNo, we are outside of the paddock.\n\n01:54.000 --> 01:56.000\nWe're not in the paddock.\n\n01:56.000 --> 02:07.000\nAnd it looks like they're coming towards us.\n\n02:07.000 --> 02:13.000\nAll right, just calm down, just please. Raptors, if you will just...\n\n02:13.000 --> 02:19.000\nSpencer, stay perfectly still. The visual acuity is based on movement.\n\n02:19.000 --> 02:23.000\nOh thank god, he's here.\n\n02:23.000 --> 02:28.000\nEasy. Easy.\n\n02:28.000 --> 02:31.000\nChris Pratt, is that you?\n\n02:31.000 --> 02:39.000\nAlpha Daisy, Beta Margaret. I only saw the movie once, but easy.\n\n02:39.000 --> 02:44.000\nThey don't like to be talked to that way.\n\n02:44.000 --> 02:48.000\nThe mic cord is wrapped around...\n\n02:48.000 --> 02:52.000\nThe mic cord's visual acuity is based on movement.\n\n02:52.000 --> 02:58.000\nEasy raptors, easy. They're good dinosaurs.\n\n02:58.000 --> 02:59.000\nThank you.\n\n02:59.000 --> 03:03.000\nI know Jeff, I know you're very passionate about them being used as weapons.\n\n03:03.000 --> 03:08.000\nI feel like they must be because we're fighting a global war on terror.\n\n03:08.000 --> 03:13.000\nAs long as you maintain that stance from the beginning of the movie all the way to the end...\n\n03:13.000 --> 03:19.000\nBut here's my thing, with no perceivable arc whatsoever...\n\n03:19.000 --> 03:22.000\nMaybe I just have been free scenes and I just say that free time.\n\n03:22.000 --> 03:24.000\nI guess, but that's the middle scene.\n\n03:24.000 --> 03:28.000\nYou should be like, maybe they should be something to make Sundays.\n\n03:28.000 --> 03:33.000\nI don't know, but I'm not here to talk about story structure.\n\n03:33.000 --> 03:41.000\nGo on, go on. Raptors, back to your paddock.\n\n03:41.000 --> 03:44.000\nPlease.\n\n03:44.000 --> 03:49.000\nThat was just as disorganized as that first date we went on.\n\n03:49.000 --> 03:52.000\nWait, I have a question.\n\n03:52.000 --> 03:56.000\nIs this... somebody's aunt, right?\n\n03:56.000 --> 03:57.000\nIn the movie, there was...\n\n03:57.000 --> 03:58.000\nYes, yes, the most...\n\n03:58.000 --> 04:03.000\nYes, I am an aunt and it is the most important relationship you can ever have.\n\n04:03.000 --> 04:06.000\nEveryone wants to spend time with their aunt, yes.\n\n04:06.000 --> 04:07.000\nYes.\n\n04:07.000 --> 04:11.000\nBut listen... Why wasn't it the mother in that movie? Why are the aunts in that?\n\n04:11.000 --> 04:17.000\nBecause she had to be hot and it would have been weird if it was their mom.\n\n04:17.000 --> 04:20.000\nListen, I'm sorry we went on a date.\n\n04:20.000 --> 04:23.000\nJust thanks for not wearing shorts tonight.\n\n04:23.000 --> 04:26.000\nI don't know why you did whatever you did.\n\n04:26.000 --> 04:29.000\nYou had a itinerary or that's our backstory.\n\n04:29.000 --> 04:32.000\nVery organized and very career driven.\n\n04:32.000 --> 04:36.000\nDoesn't make any sense that we had backstory at all.\n\n04:36.000 --> 04:39.000\nWhy did we go on that date? Isn't that on both of us?\n\n04:39.000 --> 04:42.000\nIf we went on a date, why would we see each other and go on a date\n\n04:42.000 --> 04:45.000\nand why would we be mad that it didn't work out?\n\n04:45.000 --> 04:46.000\nYeah, doesn't make any sense.\n\n04:46.000 --> 04:48.000\nThat's what dates are supposed to do.\n\n04:48.000 --> 04:53.000\nYou should get mad if you marry someone on accident.\n\n04:53.000 --> 04:57.000\nYou shouldn't be mad if you go on a date and someone wears cargo shorts.\n\n04:57.000 --> 04:59.000\nOr is too organized.\n\n04:59.000 --> 05:02.000\nIt would make more sense if maybe we had a one night stand\n\n05:02.000 --> 05:05.000\nbut it looks like we just got sandwiches.\n\n05:05.000 --> 05:09.000\nAnd then didn't get along and now we hate each other for some reason.\n\n05:09.000 --> 05:15.000\nBut nothing gets everybody hard and wet like hunting dinosaurs.\n\n05:15.000 --> 05:19.000\nYou know dinosaurs just want to do this and then that and then that.\n\n05:19.000 --> 05:23.000\nYou got to know what one of those is.\n\n05:23.000 --> 05:26.000\nThis is very disorganized for my taste.\n\n05:26.000 --> 05:27.000\nDan?\n\n05:27.000 --> 05:28.000\nYes.\n\n05:28.000 --> 05:30.000\nCan we talk a little bit about your weapon?\n\n05:30.000 --> 05:32.000\nShow me this rifle you have.\n\n05:32.000 --> 05:38.000\nI'm afraid to take it off now that I know that police can mistake a towel for a gun.\n\n05:38.000 --> 05:40.000\nIt has the orange tip on it.\n\n05:40.000 --> 05:43.000\nI don't think you're going to get shot.\n\n05:43.000 --> 05:45.000\nA towel, Jeff.\n\n05:45.000 --> 05:50.000\nA towel has no trigger or handle or sights on it.\n\n05:50.000 --> 05:56.000\nLet's have a hand for my wife, Erin McGathy.\n\n05:56.000 --> 05:58.000\nIt was me the whole time.\n\n05:58.000 --> 06:01.000\nBack to your paddock. Back to your paddock.\n\n06:01.000 --> 06:03.000\nShe's going back to her paddock.\n\n06:03.000 --> 06:04.000\nWow.\n\n06:04.000 --> 06:05.000\nOh.\n\n06:05.000 --> 06:06.000\nIn heels.\n\n06:06.000 --> 06:10.000\nShe's going to run 45 miles an hour to her paddock.\n\n06:10.000 --> 06:12.000\nIn high heels.\n\n06:12.000 --> 06:15.000\nAlso, you have a knife in the back too?\n\n06:15.000 --> 06:17.000\nYou got a little weapon behind you too?\n\n06:17.000 --> 06:19.000\nThis isn't a knife.\n\n06:19.000 --> 06:24.000\nThis is a knife.\n\n06:24.000 --> 06:26.000\nDon't put it by me.\n\n06:26.000 --> 06:27.000\nI'm going to get shot.\n\n06:27.000 --> 06:29.000\nYou asked me to take it off.\n\n06:29.000 --> 06:35.000\nThank you, Diego.

Who knows.\n\n12:04.000 --> 12:06.000\nHe's okay with the guy.\n\n12:06.000 --> 12:08.000\nYes, that was the Kevin Smith joke.\n\n12:08.000 --> 12:12.000\nAlright, so upside down three prong outlets.\n\n12:12.000 --> 12:13.000\nWhy?\n\n12:13.000 --> 12:16.000\nThe other two, one's a hot, one's a neutral.\n\n12:16.000 --> 12:19.000\nAnd if those are actually the other way,\n\n12:19.000 --> 12:23.000\nand you happen to drop your metal piece of something,\n\n12:23.000 --> 12:26.000\nand it hit those, and you're connected to it,\n\n12:26.000 --> 12:28.000\nyou would hurt yourself.\n\n12:28.000 --> 12:30.000\nThat's why if it's the other way...\n\n12:30.000 --> 12:33.000\nSo you're a union electrician, but you call it a metal piece of something?\n\n12:33.000 --> 12:40.000\nNo, let's say your metal piece of clothing,\n\n12:40.000 --> 12:42.000\nor some sort of metal thing that happened to hit it,\n\n12:42.000 --> 12:44.000\nor something you're reading, I don't know,\n\n12:44.000 --> 12:48.000\nbut I would hit it, so that's why when it actually does hit it, you get hurt.\n\n12:48.000 --> 12:51.000\nSo if it's the ground, which is the little point,\n\n12:51.000 --> 12:55.000\nhits it first, because it slides behind the bed or the table,\n\n12:55.000 --> 12:57.000\nyou're safer, because it hits the ground.\n\n12:57.000 --> 12:59.000\nIf it hits the neutral and the hot, boom!\n\n12:59.000 --> 13:02.000\nIt makes contact, not the way it should be,\n\n13:02.000 --> 13:04.000\nand then you'll hurt yourself.\n\n13:04.000 --> 13:07.000\nIs my brain moving slower, or is there...\n\n13:07.000 --> 13:11.000\nYou're saying that makes the difference between upside down or right side up?\n\n13:11.000 --> 13:15.000\nYes, so when you see a face that is upside down,\n\n13:15.000 --> 13:19.000\nwhere it's just the mouth on top, and then two eyeballs...\n\n13:19.000 --> 13:21.000\nNow you're talking my language.\n\n13:23.000 --> 13:26.000\nWhen Mr. Bill is upside down.\n\n13:28.000 --> 13:31.000\nSo yeah, the first thing it would hit, if it was upside down, would be the ground.\n\n13:31.000 --> 13:33.000\nWhen you say the first thing it would hit,\n\n13:33.000 --> 13:36.000\nyou mean if you're working on the wiring behind the...\n\n13:36.000 --> 13:40.000\nNo, anything that might hit it, like an article of metal, or something...\n\n13:40.000 --> 13:43.000\nOr like a thumbtack in the wall.\n\n13:43.000 --> 13:45.000\nHow did you hit a hole?\n\n13:45.000 --> 13:49.000\nLet's say you're just having a wild dance party.\n\n13:49.000 --> 13:54.000\nSo your plug is hanging out of the wall, such that some of the metal is visible, right?\n\n13:54.000 --> 13:57.000\nAnd a thumbtack falls off the wall and topples into that crevice.\n\n13:57.000 --> 13:59.000\nOh, if it's not all the way plugged in.\n\n13:59.000 --> 14:02.000\nYes. Brilliant, okay.\n\n14:02.000 --> 14:07.000\nOkay, so upside down is the fucking actual Zorro way to do it.\n\n14:07.000 --> 14:10.000\nIt is the code way, because it's the safest way.\n\n14:10.000 --> 14:14.000\nOh, and all union electricians know that.\n\n14:14.000 --> 14:16.000\nOh my God, thank you, electrician!\n\n14:16.000 --> 14:18.000\nHe's a union electrician!\n\n14:19.000 --> 14:22.000\nPut him upside down, you piece of shit!\n\n14:24.000 --> 14:26.000\nWhat was his name?\n\n14:26.000 --> 14:28.000\nWhat was your name?\n\n14:28.000 --> 14:30.000\nLogan.\n\n14:34.000 --> 14:36.000\nFake name, fake name.\n\n14:38.000 --> 14:41.000\nAll right, so, okay, more random...\n\n14:41.000 --> 14:45.000\nWe've already gotten more shit done in the harm of town than we ever have.\n\n14:45.000 --> 14:48.000\nIt's San Diego, it's a port town.\n\n14:48.000 --> 14:51.000\nIn LA, you're just playing to a crowd of people that are like,\n\n14:51.000 --> 14:54.000\nI hope Spielberg orders lunch soon.\n\n14:54.000 --> 14:57.000\nOr I might have a job.\n\n14:57.000 --> 15:00.000\nSome of these people's parents haul fish, Jeff.\n\n15:00.000 --> 15:04.000\nAll right, they skin dolphins here.\n\n15:04.000 --> 15:07.000\nThis is a labor town.\n\n15:07.000 --> 15:11.000\nI gotta get that orca into his paddock.\n\n15:11.000 --> 15:13.000\nOr my children won't eat.\n\n15:13.000 --> 15:15.000\nAll right, so there's electricians here.\n\n15:15.000 --> 15:17.000\nWe get them from San Diego.\n\n15:17.000 --> 15:19.000\nMovie skeletons.\n\n15:19.000 --> 15:23.000\nI asked my chiropractor.\n\n15:23.000 --> 15:25.000\nHe said, does your back feel better?\n\n15:25.000 --> 15:27.000\nI said, I guess.\n\n15:27.000 --> 15:29.000\nAnd then I was leaving and he goes like,\n\n15:29.000 --> 15:31.000\nhey, any more questions you have for me?\n\n15:31.000 --> 15:32.000\nAnd I said, yes.\n\n15:32.000 --> 15:35.000\nIn the movies, when you find a skeleton,\n\n15:35.000 --> 15:38.000\nthey wouldn't stay together, would they?\n\n15:40.000 --> 15:45.000\nLike when you find a pirate and he's like holding a fucking sack of gold,\n\n15:45.000 --> 15:48.000\nand he's got a hat on and a trench coat,\n\n15:48.000 --> 15:49.000\nlike that's not real.\n\n15:49.000 --> 15:51.000\nAnd he's like, well, they're held together by ligaments.\n\n15:51.000 --> 15:53.000\nAnd I'm like, and they would, and he's like, they would rot.\n\n15:53.000 --> 15:56.000\nAnd I'm like, so goonies is a piece of shit.\n\n15:58.000 --> 16:01.000\nYou can't have fucking skeletons in the midst of like,\n\n16:01.000 --> 16:02.000\nsteering a ship.\n\n16:02.000 --> 16:04.000\nThat shit wouldn't happen.\n\n16:04.000 --> 16:08.000\nWait, so you're not, you don't have a problem with a skeleton being alive,\n\n16:08.000 --> 16:10.000\njust that it's together?\n\n16:10.000 --> 16:13.000\nWell, I'm assuming if you're allowing for magic,\n\n16:13.000 --> 16:15.000\nthen you're allowing that they could just be like,\n\n16:15.000 --> 16:17.000\nI don't know if brooms can fight Mickey Mouse,\n\n16:17.000 --> 16:19.000\nthen a skeleton can hang out, I guess.\n\n16:19.000 --> 16:22.000\nBut, but when you find a skeleton,\n\n16:22.000 --> 16:25.000\non the Pirates of the Caribbean ride, when you're in Lyon,\n\n16:25.000 --> 16:29.000\nthere's that pirate that's like leaning up against a wall with a sword through his chest.\n\n16:29.000 --> 16:31.000\nHe would just be a pilot.\n\n16:31.000 --> 16:33.000\nYeah, it's not like Hiroshima where it's like,\n\n16:33.000 --> 16:38.000\noh, there was a kid throwing a ball in the air or, or like, too soon.\n\n16:41.000 --> 16:44.000\nThey're not saying boo, they're saying goonies.\n\n16:46.000 --> 16:48.000\nOr, or okay, okay guys, Pompeii.\n\n16:48.000 --> 16:50.000\nIs that, is that cool enough?\n\n16:50.000 --> 16:52.000\nAll right, you guys over, Pompeii?\n\n16:56.000 --> 16:58.000\nThis was a rich man getting held up by a beggar,\n\n16:58.000 --> 17:00.000\nlike, you know, getting to see him, it's like,\n\n17:00.000 --> 17:02.000\nokay, I guess the ash fell that fast.\n\n17:02.000 --> 17:05.000\nBut if you, unless you, if you lay down,\n\n17:05.000 --> 17:07.000\nand we're like, I'm gonna die,\n\n17:07.000 --> 17:10.000\nI'm gonna be a skeleton when they find me,\n\n17:10.000 --> 17:12.000\nI'm gonna lay down, you'd have to lay all the way down,\n\n17:12.000 --> 17:15.000\nand then just like, make sure there was no air in the room,\n\n17:15.000 --> 17:17.000\nand like, and then you slowly rot,\n\n17:17.000 --> 17:19.000\nlike 6,000 years later, you'd be a skeleton,\n\n17:19.000 --> 17:21.000\nbut the minute somebody was like,\n\n17:21.000 --> 17:23.000\nlook, it's a skeleton, if they touched your arm,\n\n17:23.000 --> 17:25.000\nyou couldn't like, lift you up like a puppet.\n\n17:25.000 --> 17:27.000\nYour arm would make all of the,\n\n17:27.000 --> 17:29.000\nit would fall down like a house of cards.\n\n17:29.000 --> 17:31.000\nAll right, so I'm glad I could thank you.\n\n17:31.000 --> 17:33.000\nWe're getting so much done today.\n\n17:33.000 --> 17:36.000\nOkay, all right, screenwriters,\n\n17:36.000 --> 17:39.000\nI know there's 90 of you in the room right now,\n\n17:39.000 --> 17:42.000\nbecause, because the software does the formatting work,\n\n17:42.000 --> 17:45.000\nso now everyone's a fucking screenwriter.\n\n17:45.000 --> 17:50.000\nUh, I'm gonna take a page out of your, uh, script.\n\n17:50.000 --> 17:55.000\nUh, everything happens suddenly.\n\n17:55.000 --> 17:58.000\nDumb fucks.\n\n17:58.000 --> 18:01.000\nStop telling, everything happens suddenly.\n\n18:01.000 --> 18:06.000\nIf a car explodes gradually, let me know.\n\n18:06.000 --> 18:09.000\nOtherwise, I imagine it suddenly.\n\n18:09.000 --> 18:14.000\nI know it's a, a car explodes, you're done, move on.\n\n18:14.000 --> 18:18.000\nSave a word, Frasier.\n\n18:18.000 --> 18:20.000\nI didn't pick, I'm not gonna picture the car\n\n18:20.000 --> 18:22.000\nslowly turning orange and then blossoming\n\n18:22.000 --> 18:26.000\ninto a dismantled car over the period of six months.\n\n18:26.000 --> 18:29.000\nHave you never said suddenly in a script, even early days?\n\n18:29.000 --> 18:33.000\nWhen I was, uh, dumb and then I grew,\n\n18:33.000 --> 18:37.000\nthat's why I'm angry, it's called bullying.\n\n18:37.000 --> 18:40.000\nOkay, pedicabs.\n\n18:40.000 --> 18:44.000\nHey, could we have a more uncomfortable on the nose\n\n18:44.000 -->

color?\n\n19:23.000 --> 19:25.000\nThat doesn't mean anything.\n\n19:25.000 --> 19:28.000\nDoes that mean you want everything to be that color?\n\n19:28.000 --> 19:31.000\nThen you're using color wrong.\n\n19:31.000 --> 19:34.000\nThat's like having a favorite musical note.\n\n19:34.000 --> 19:37.000\nHat, hat, hat, hat, hat.\n\n19:37.000 --> 19:39.000\nThat's it, you wouldn't be a

dog in my ice cream.\n\n19:53.000 --> 19:54.000\nYeah, you do.\n\n19:54.000 --> 19:55.000\nNo.\n\n19:55.000 --> 19:57.000\nWe're gonna prove it by the end of the day.\n\n19:57.000 --> 19:59.000\nYou go like ice cream, we just found that out.\n\n19:59.000 --> 20:02.000\nYou gonna put a hot dog in it on a Monday?\n\n20:02.000 --> 20:03.000\nI like it.\n\n20:03.000 --> 20:04.000\nHiroshima.\n\n20:06.000 --> 20:09.000\nWe did Hiroshima though, right?\n\n20:09.000 --> 20:11.000\nYeah, that was our fault.\n\n20:11.000 --> 20:15.000\nThat's like a, I can't come up with a non-offensive example.\n\n20:15.000 --> 20:17.000\nSo I won't.\n\n20:19.000 --> 20:20.000\nOkay.\n\n20:20.000 --> 20:21.000\nYou're welcome.\n\n20:21.000 --> 20:23.000\nSpencer, all right.\n\n20:23.000 --> 20:26.000\nYou're Harry Truman, you're the newly-elect president.\n\n20:26.000 --> 20:28.000\nIt's the end of World War II.\n\n20:28.000 --> 20:32.000\nDo you drop the atomic bomb, the newly created atomic bomb\n\n20:32.000 --> 20:34.000\nto end the war and save lives, or do you not do it?\n\n20:34.000 --> 20:37.000\nMake your answer thoughtful enough that I can make a drink.\n\n20:37.000 --> 20:38.000\nOkay.\n\n20:38.000 --> 20:43.000\nSo, I mean, what did Harry Truman do besides that?\n\n20:43.000 --> 20:44.000\nAnything?\n\n20:44.000 --> 20:45.000\nNot a whole lot.\n\n20:45.000 --> 20:47.000\nHe wasn't in office very long, I don't think.\n\n20:47.000 --> 20:48.000\nWell,\n\n20:48.000 --> 20:49.000\nSee what?\n\n20:49.000 --> 20:50.000\nThe Warsaw pack.\n\n20:50.000 --> 20:51.000\nWarsaw pack.\n\n20:51.000 --> 20:52.000\nThank you, sir.\n\n20:52.000 --> 20:53.000\nThe Warsaw pack.\n\n20:53.000 --> 20:55.000\nHe did beat do it.\n\n20:55.000 --> 20:56.000\nHe did beat do it.\n\n20:56.000 --> 21:00.000\nBut not according to one newspaper.\n\n21:00.000 --> 21:05.000\nSo, this is coming off the heels of the Warsaw pack.\n\n21:05.000 --> 21:07.000\nYeah, he's riding high on that.\n\n21:07.000 --> 21:08.000\nYeah.\n\n21:08.000 --> 21:10.000\nHe's got that Warsaw pack's cachet.\n\n21:10.000 --> 21:11.000\nAll right.\n\n21:11.000 --> 21:12.000\nDance good.\n\n21:12.000 --> 21:16.000\nNow, your secretary of defense and war and all those people come in and say,\n\n21:16.000 --> 21:19.000\nall right, Mr. President, we have this new weapon.\n\n21:19.000 --> 21:22.000\nWe're going to drop it, or we won't.\n\n21:22.000 --> 21:26.000\nDo we do it to save American lives and kill a zillion people instantly,\n\n21:26.000 --> 21:29.000\nor do we not do that morality-wise?\n\n21:29.000 --> 21:33.000\nDo we do it to scare off the Nazis and the rest of the world,\n\n21:33.000 --> 21:37.000\nthe Soviets who are current allies, maybe our next enemy?\n\n21:37.000 --> 21:38.000\nWhat do you do?\n\n21:38.000 --> 21:41.000\nYou're President Spencer Crittenden.\n\n21:41.000 --> 21:47.000\nDrop the fucking hammer.\n\n21:47.000 --> 21:51.000\nBut you know that was not about protecting ourselves from the Japanese.\n\n21:51.000 --> 21:52.000\nWe had won that war.\n\n21:52.000 --> 21:54.000\nThat was about an excuse.\n\n21:54.000 --> 21:57.000\nIt was about making them surrender.\n\n21:57.000 --> 21:59.000\nWhen they were going to lose.\n\n21:59.000 --> 22:00.000\nNo, it was about revealing.\n\n22:00.000 --> 22:01.000\nLet's bring Logan back up.\n\n22:01.000 --> 22:03.000\nLogan, get back up here.\n\n22:03.000 --> 22:04.000\nI'm kidding, of course.\n\n22:04.000 --> 22:07.000\nIt was obviously about revealing in our game of Hearthstone\n\n22:07.000 --> 22:10.000\nthat we had the fucking mushroom cloud card.\n\n22:10.000 --> 22:14.000\nYeah, most actions have multiple reasons, sure.\n\n22:14.000 --> 22:15.000\nBut that was the reason.\n\n22:15.000 --> 22:17.000\nThe Japanese weren't defeated.\n\n22:17.000 --> 22:18.000\nYeah, but they weren't giving up.\n\n22:18.000 --> 22:19.000\nThat was the thing.\n\n22:19.000 --> 22:21.000\nThey were defeated, but they weren't giving up.\n\n22:21.000 --> 22:24.000\nAnd they needed to check it out.\n\n22:24.000 --> 22:27.000\nHalf your city, two of your cities are gone, fucking give up.\n\n22:27.000 --> 22:29.000\nBut we were showing that to the world.\n\n22:29.000 --> 22:31.000\nYeah, both of us are right.\n\n22:31.000 --> 22:32.000\nHow about that?\n\n22:32.000 --> 22:33.000\nYeah, we're both right.\n\n22:33.000 --> 22:34.000\nOkay.\n\n22:34.000 --> 22:38.000\nI mean, talk about, the real quandary is Nagasaki.\n\n22:38.000 --> 22:39.000\nLike why the second one?\n\n22:39.000 --> 22:42.000\nThe answer in our history books when we were kids.\n\n22:42.000 --> 22:44.000\nDown in Nagasaki where the men on Chuchabaki\n\n22:44.000 --> 22:47.000\nand the women wiki-waki-wook?\n\n22:47.000 --> 22:49.000\nToo soon.\n\n22:49.000 --> 22:52.000\nNagasaki, we dropped the bomb right away on them.\n\n22:52.000 --> 22:56.000\nAnd that was in history, what we learned in American grade schools\n\n22:56.000 --> 22:59.000\nis the reason we did that is because, and this sounds,\n\n22:59.000 --> 23:01.000\nthis could either be true or not true,\n\n23:01.000 --> 23:03.000\nbut it just sounds so sixth grade.\n\n23:03.000 --> 23:05.000\nLike we had to drop the bomb on Nagasaki\n\n23:05.000 --> 23:07.000\nbecause otherwise they would have thought\n\n23:07.000 --> 23:11.000\nwe only were able to make one.\n\n23:11.000 --> 23:13.000\nThat's the only reason that I know of.\n\n23:13.000 --> 23:14.000\nThat's the only reason that I learned.\n\n23:14.000 --> 23:16.000\nThere's like, I mean,\n\n23:16.000 --> 23:19.000\nthose pilots have written memoirs and books and shit.\n\n23:19.000 --> 23:22.000\nThere might be some crazy drama surrounding the second bomb, man.\n\n23:22.000 --> 23:24.000\nThe second one was about, it missed.\n\n23:24.000 --> 23:25.000\nIt flew over a hill.\n\n23:25.000 --> 23:28.000\nIt didn't take out as much as the town as they hoped it would.\n\n23:28.000 --> 23:29.000\nYeah.\n\n23:29.000 --> 23:32.000\nYeah, they wanted to bomb somewhere else, right?\n\n23:32.000 --> 23:35.000\nYeah, but the weather was bad that day, right?\n\n23:35.000 --> 23:40.000\nThe weather was bad for bombing.\n\n23:40.000 --> 23:42.000\nThat's my main problem with Japan.\n\n23:42.000 --> 23:44.000\nIt's usually terrible bombing weather.\n\n23:44.000 --> 23:47.000\nSpeaking of military strategy,\n\n23:47.000 --> 23:49.000\nthis was a historic comic-con.\n\n23:49.000 --> 23:51.000\nThey had drones down on the dock\n\n23:51.000 --> 23:54.000\nthat were like shaped like the Doctor Who TARDIS.\n\n23:54.000 --> 23:56.000\nAnd they were flying them up in the air\n\n23:56.000 --> 23:59.000\nand the fucking Air Force came in and shut it down.\n\n23:59.000 --> 24:00.000\nWhat?\n\n24:00.000 --> 24:01.000\nYeah.\n\n24:01.000 --> 24:02.000\nThat's what I heard.\n\n24:02.000 --> 24:03.000\nI wasn't there.\n\n24:03.000 --> 24:04.000\nWere they jealous?\n\n24:04.000 --> 24:05.000\nThey're like, are you for me?\n\n24:05.000 --> 24:06.000\nJealous?\n\n24:06.000 --> 24:07.000\nMake a rectangle.\n\n24:07.000 --> 24:09.000\nMake a saginal...\n\n24:09.000 --> 24:11.000\nI think they're just so close to it.\n\n24:11.000 --> 24:12.000\nI mean, this is a military base.\n\n24:12.000 --> 24:14.000\nSan Diego is a military base.\n\n24:14.000 --> 24:18.000\nThere's an enormous aircraft carrier out in the harbor right now.\n\n24:18.000 --> 24:19.000\nThere's a couple.\n\n24:19.000 --> 24:21.000\nLogan, what's the name of the aircraft carrier?\n\n24:21.000 --> 24:23.000\nThat wasn't Logan, but thank you, sir.\n\n24:23.000 --> 24:24.000\nThe Vincent.\n\n24:24.000 --> 24:25.000\nReagan and the Vincent.\n\n24:25.000 --> 24:27.000\nI don't know any more details on that.\n\n24:27.000 --> 24:28.000\nThe Reagan class?\n\n24:28.000 --> 24:30.000\nThe Reagan and the Vincent.\n\n24:30.000 --> 24:31.000\nThe Nimitz class.\n\n24:31.000 --> 24:32.000\nOh, Nimitz class.\n\n24:32.000 --> 24:33.000\nHoly shit.\n\n24:33.000 --> 24:35.000\nAnyways, they had to put a net around\n\n24:35.000 --> 24:36.000\nwhere they were demonstrating the drones,\n\n24:36.000 --> 24:38.000\nbecause now everyone can have a drone now.\n\n24:38.000 --> 24:40.000\nAnd so they were like,\n\n24:40.000 --> 24:42.000\nbut you can't have a drone.\n\n24:42.000 --> 24:44.000\nYou could wage war on America now\n\n24:44.000 --> 24:46.000\nwith your Dr. Who Tardis.\n\n24:46.000 --> 24:48.000\nThey got nervous.\n\n24:48.000 --> 24:52.000\nThey know shit we don't about drone warfare then,\n\n24:52.000 --> 24:54.000\nbecause I don't think anyone out there was thinking,\n\n24:54.000 --> 24:56.000\nboy, if we put a bomb on this,\n\n24:56.000 --> 24:58.000\nif we put an ISIS guy on there,\n\n24:58.000 --> 25:00.000\nand they were thinking that,\n\n25:00.000 --> 25:02.000\nthey're like, if there was an ISIS guy on there...\n\n25:02.000 --> 25:04.000\nIf you put a guy on the drone, it's not a drone anymore.\n\n25:04.000 --> 25:06.000\nIt's just a plane.\n\n25:06.000 --> 25:11.000\nNot if he's not flying it, though, right?\n\n25:11.000 --> 25:12.000\nSay what?\n\n25:12.000 --> 25:13.000\nNot if he's not flying it.\n\n25:13.000 --> 25:14.000\nYeah, what if he's like the bomb?\n\n25:14.000 --> 25:16.000\nIsn't it still a drone if he's just hanging out?\n\n25:16.000 --> 25:17.000\nHe's just laying back?\n\n25:17.000 --> 25:18.000\nYeah.\n\n25:18.000 --> 25:20.000\nIf he's taking a nap, it's a drone.\n\n25:20.000 --> 25:21.000\nAnd he's on a drone.\n\n25:21.000 --> 25:25.000\nI've seen Minecraft drones that look like gasts.\n\n25:25.000 --> 25:27.000\nNo one gets it.\n\n25:27.000 --> 25:28.000\nWe all get it.\n\n25:28.000 --> 25:30.000\nI mean, it's not a joke, really.\n\n25:30.000 --> 25:33.000\nSo, right reaction.\n\n25:33.000 --> 25:34.000\nOkay.\n\n25:34.000 --> 25:35.000\nAlso right reaction.\n\n25:35.000 --> 25:38.000\nI want to know more about this guy wearing the banana house.\n\n25:38.000 --> 25:41.000\nI don't know if we do.\n\n25:41.000 --> 25:42.000\nWe don't want to know.\n\n25:42.000 --> 25:43.000\nHe's dressed like a banana.\n\n25:43.000 --> 25:44.000\nI mean...\n\n25:44.000 --> 25:47.000\nNo, he's just pointed at himself like me.\n\n25:54.000 --> 25:55.000\nOh, no.\n\n25:55.000 --> 25:56.000\nOkay, get out here.\n\n25:56.000 --> 25:58.000\nBanana guy.\n\n25:58.000 --> 26:00.000\nBanana gentleman.\n\n26:00.000 --> 26:01.000\nWhat's your name?\n\n26:01.000 --> 26:02.000\nVictor.\n\n26:02.000 --> 26:03.000\nI should have known.\n\n26:03.000 --> 26:05.000\nTake that mic, banana guy.\n\n26:05.000 --> 26:06.000\nWhat's your name?\n\n26:06.000 --> 26:07.000\nVictor.\n\n26:07.000 --> 26:08.000\nVictor.\n\n26:08.000 --> 26:09.000\nWhy a banana?\n\n26:09.000 --> 26:10.000\nWhy not?\n\n26:10.000 --> 26:11.000\nYeah.\n\n26:11.000 --> 26:12.000\nAlright.\n\n26:12.000 --> 26:13.000\nSan Diego.\n\n26:13.000 --> 26:14.000\nAlright.\n\n26:14.000 --> 26:17.000\nVictor, what is your greatest fear in life?\n\n26:17.000 --> 26:18.000\nWhat's your...\n\n26:18.000 --> 26:20.000\nWhat's the motivating fear in your life?\n\n26:20.000 --> 26:22.000\nWhen you wake up and you have a bad dream,\n\n26:22.000 --> 26:25.000\nwhat's the thing that is the most terrifying possibility\n\n26:25.000 --> 26:28.000\nfor a gentleman that wears a banana outfit?\n\n26:28.000 --> 26:30.000\nWell, I'm in character right now.\n\n26:30.000 --> 26:32.000\nSo, someone eating me.\n\n26:32.000 --> 26:33.000\nNo, for real.\n\n26:33.000 --> 26:34.000\nJust Victor.\n\n26:34.000 --> 26:35.000\nNot banana guy.\n\n26:35.000 --> 26:36.000\nVictor.\n\n26:38.000 --> 26:41.000\nNot knowing what to say?\n\n26:41.000 --> 26:42.000\nReally?\n\n26:42.000 --> 26:43.000\nYes.\n\n26:43.000 --> 26:45.000\nWell, what's the worst that could happen\n\n26:45.000 --> 26:46.000\nif you didn't know what to say?\n\n26:46.000 --> 26:49.000\nPeople stare at me.\n\n26:49.000 --> 26:50.000\nSo, as a...\n\n26:50.000 --> 26:54.000\nBut now we tie it back into you dressing like a banana.\n\n26:54.000 --> 26:56.000\nBecause your biggest indirect fear\n\n26:56.000 --> 26:57.000\nis people staring at you.\n\n26:57.000 --> 26:59.000\nNo, but I get it because then when you're...\n\n26:59.000 --> 27:00.000\nif you dress like a banana,\n\n27:00.000 --> 27:03.000\npeople will stare at you and you don't have to say anything.\n\n27:03.000 --> 27:04.000\nYou've said it all.\n\n27:04.000 --> 27:05.000\nI'm a banana.\n\n27:05.000 --> 27:06.000\nLike a dance.\n\n27:06.000 --> 27:07.000\nAnd you're...\n\n27:07.000 --> 27:08.000\nSo, your fear...\n\n27:08.000 --> 27:10.000\nLike Barack Obama doesn't dress like a banana.\n\n27:10.000 --> 27:11.000\nHe becomes president.\n\n27:11.000 --> 27:12.000\nLike, you're like,\n\n27:12.000 --> 27:14.000\nlook at me, I'm a banana.\n\n27:14.000 --> 27:15.000\nThat goes to my thesis earlier,\n\n27:15.000 --> 27:16.000\nthat people go like,\n\n27:16.000 --> 27:17.000\nhey, Deadpool, can I get a picture?\n\n27:17.000 --> 27:18.000\nAnd you're like,\n\n27:18.000 --> 27:19.000\nI feel like I'm somebody.\n\n27:19.000 --> 27:20.000\nI get that.\n\n27:20.000 --> 27:21.000\nI get it.\n\n27:21.000 --> 27:24.000\nLike, my banana costume is like having a feud with Chevy Chase\n\n27:24.000 --> 27:26.000\nand like...\n\n27:26.000 --> 27:28.000\nLike, whatever it takes to...\n\n27:28.000 --> 27:29.000\nI get it.\n\n27:29.000 --> 27:31.000\nLike, because I get the feeling of like,\n\n27:31.000 --> 27:32.000\noh, I have an identity now\n\n27:32.000 --> 27:35.000\nand I don't disparage it at all.\n\n27:35.000 --> 27:37.000\nWhat's...\n\n27:37.000 --> 27:40.000\nWhere are you at on the Kinsey scale, do you think?\n\n27:42.000 --> 27:45.000\nIf 100% is like just totally straight as an arrow...\n\n27:45.000 --> 27:46.000\nOne to six, right?\n\n27:46.000 --> 27:47.000\nOne to seven.\n\n27:47.000 --> 27:48.000\nOh, is it one to six?\n\n27:48.000 --> 27:50.000\nOne to six.\n\n27:50.000 --> 27:53.000\nOne being straightest.\n\n27:53.000 --> 27:54.000\nWhat is the scale?\n\n27:54.000 --> 27:56.000\nI think one is straightest\n\n27:56.000 --> 27:58.000\nand six is like...\n\n27:58.000 --> 27:59.000\nYou can go by hypotheticals.\n\n27:59.000 --> 28:03.000\nLike, if another dude dressed as a banana came in\n\n28:03.000 --> 28:06.000\nand he looked like Ewan McGregor...\n\n28:06.000 --> 28:08.000\nWell, that's not even...\n\n28:08.000 --> 28:09.000\nThat's a...\n\n28:09.000 --> 28:10.000\nYou'd hit that?\n\n28:10.000 --> 28:11.000\nTotally.\n\n28:11.000 --> 28:12.000\nOkay.\n\n28:12.000 --> 28:13.000\nAlright, that's a good enough answer.\n\n28:13.000 --> 28:14.000\nThat's at least a three.\n\n28:14.000 --> 28:16.000\nIs he really dressed like a banana?\n\n28:16.000 --> 28:18.000\nYeah, of course he's dressed like a banana.\n\n28:18.000 --> 28:19.000\nThen you can just split and get out of here.\n\n28:19.000 --> 28:20.000\nThat'd be cool.\n\n28:20.000 --> 28:22.000\nOh, you guys like...\n\n28:22.000 --> 28:23.000\nYou guys like word play.\n\n28:23.000 --> 28:25.000\nThere are three banana punts in the world\n\n28:25.000 --> 28:26.000\nand that's one of them.\n\n28:26.000 --> 28:28.000\nWhat's the second one?\n\n28:28.000 --> 28:29.000\nI can't...\n\n28:29.000 --> 28:31.000\nI'm going bananas.\n\n28:31.000 --> 28:34.000\nYou're doing it for the group appeal.\n\n28:38.000 --> 28:39.000\nVictors of the banana, everybody.\n\n28:39.000 --> 28:41.000\nVictors of the banana.\n\n28:41.000 --> 28:42.000\nBanana man!\n\n28:46.000 --> 28:47.000\nIt's a banana.\n\n28:48.000 --> 28:49.000\nAlright.\n\n28:49.000 --> 28:50.000\nWe met a banana today.\n\n28:50.000 --> 28:52.000\nAlright, question for you.\n\n28:52.000 --> 28:53.000\nYeah?\n\n28:53.000 --> 28:54.000\nThere's this movie,\n\n28:54.000 --> 28:56.000\nJames Franco and Jonah Hill are in it.\n\n28:56.000 --> 28:58.000\nIt's called True Story.\n\n28:58.000 --> 29:01.000\nIt's on all the hotel TVs right now.\n\n29:01.000 --> 29:02.000\nI didn't really notice it in theaters.\n\n29:02.000 --> 29:04.000\nAnd on all the hotel TVs?\n\n29:04.000 --> 29:05.000\nYeah, everyone.\n\n29:05.000 --> 29:07.000\nSo it's like about a murderer\n\n29:07.000 --> 29:09.000\nand it's based on the True Story\n\n29:09.000 --> 29:10.000\nand it's called True Story\n\n29:10.000 --> 29:11.000\nand it's like...\n\n29:11.000 --> 29:12.000\nIt's a serious movie.\n\n29:12.000 --> 29:14.000\nDo you think that...\n\n29:14.000 --> 29:16.000\nDo you think that Jonah Hill's agent\n\n29:16.000 --> 29:18.000\nand James Franco's agent both separately\n\n29:18.000 --> 29:20.000\nwere like, dude, you got to do...\n\n29:20.000 --> 29:21.000\nYou got to do another serious one.\n\n29:21.000 --> 29:23.000\nLike, you've been silly for like five movies in a row.\n\n29:23.000 --> 29:26.000\nLike, let's show them your money ball chops\n\n29:26.000 --> 29:30.000\nor your guy with the arm behind a rock chops.\n\n29:31.000 --> 29:32.000\nAnd then they both...\n\n29:32.000 --> 29:34.000\nDo you think they both separately were like,\n\n29:34.000 --> 29:36.000\nokay, yeah, yeah, I got to pay some dues.\n\n29:36.000 --> 29:38.000\nLet's show them some drama shit.\n\n29:38.000 --> 29:39.000\nLet's get an Oscar.\n\n29:39.000 --> 29:40.000\nAnd then they walked in a set\n\n29:40.000 --> 29:42.000\nand they're like, what the fuck?\n\n29:42.000 --> 29:43.000\nWhen they saw each other,\n\n29:43.000 --> 29:46.000\nno one's going to take this movie seriously.\n\n29:46.000 --> 29:47.000\nLike, you got to put money ball\n\n29:47.000 --> 29:50.000\nwith like a dramatic actor and vice versa.\n\n29:50.000 --> 29:51.000\nYou can't...\n\n29:51.000 --> 29:52.000\nThey look ridiculous together\n\n29:52.000 --> 29:53.000\nand it's a terrible movie.\n\n29:53.000 --> 29:55.000\nOkay, let's move on.\n\n29:55.000 --> 29:57.000\nSo I saw a three-legged dog\n\n29:57.000 --> 29:58.000\nwalking down the streets of San Diego.\n\n29:58.000 --> 29:59.000\nI think I saw that dog.\n\n29:59.000 --> 30:00.000\nI love this joke.\n\n30:00.000 --> 30:02.000\nI love this joke.\n\n30:02.000 --> 30:03.000\nIt's not a joke.\n\n30:03.000 --> 30:05.000\nThere's a dog with three legs\n\n30:05.000 --> 30:06.000\nwith the missing leg was...\n\n30:06.000 --> 30:07.000\nGoes into a bar.\n\n30:07.000 --> 30:12.000\nThe missing leg was in the back.\n\n30:12.000 --> 30:15.000\nAnd I was watching it and the...\n\n30:15.000 --> 30:16.000\nYou can't tell when dogs...\n\n30:16.000 --> 30:18.000\nThe fact that the dog could have three legs\n\n30:18.000 --> 30:22.000\nand not show it on its face\n\n30:22.000 --> 30:24.000\nkind of makes me panic about\n\n30:24.000 --> 30:26.000\nhow well I'm taking care of my dog.\n\n30:26.000 --> 30:28.000\nBecause my dog always looks happy\n\n30:28.000 --> 30:30.000\nand so did this dog.\n\n30:30.000 --> 30:33.000\nAnd he's one quarter down\n\n30:33.000 --> 30:37.000\nof the fundamental economy of dogmas.\n\n30:37.000 --> 30:40.000\nHe's totally fucked as a dog\n\n30:40.000 --> 30:41.000\nand he was like,\n\n30:41.000 --> 30:42.000\nyeah, let's go to...\n\n30:42.000 --> 30:45.000\nAnybody got some bacon?\n\n30:45.000 --> 30:47.000\nBut the thing that was really distracting\n\n30:47.000 --> 30:49.000\nwas like assuming that's a male dog\n\n30:49.000 --> 30:51.000\nbecause I think female dogs kind of squat.\n\n30:51.000 --> 30:53.000\nSo does Harvey.\n\n30:53.000 --> 30:55.000\nDo you know this that male dogs\n\n30:55.000 --> 30:57.000\nlearn to lift a leg from each other?\n\n30:57.000 --> 30:59.000\nIt's like a learned behavior.\n\n30:59.000 --> 31:00.000\nNo.\n\n31:00.000 --> 31:02.000\nMale dogs, if they're left in a vacuum,\n\n31:02.000 --> 31:06.000\nthey'll squat and just pee down.\n\n31:06.000 --> 31:09.000\nWhere's Harvey on the Kenzie scale?\n\n31:09.000 --> 31:11.000\nI don't know.\n\n31:11.000 --> 31:13.000\nBut anyways, so I was like,\n\n31:13.000 --> 31:16.000\nassuming that's a male dog,\n\n31:16.000 --> 31:18.000\nwhat does he do when he pees?\n\n31:18.000 --> 31:21.000\nBecause half of his back legs are gone.\n\n31:21.000 --> 31:24.000\nIf he lifts one, he falls right over.\n\n31:24.000 --> 31:27.000\nSo then right as I said that,\n\n31:27.000 --> 31:29.000\nhe's stopped by a telephone pole\n\n31:29.000 --> 31:31.000\nand it's like the answer was right in front of me.\n\n31:31.000 --> 31:34.000\nThis dog, the one great thing about his life\n\n31:34.000 --> 31:36.000\nis there's no leg to lift.\n\n31:36.000 --> 31:38.000\nHe just stopped next to a telephone pole\n\n31:38.000 --> 31:42.000\nand shot a fucking laser to the side.\n\n31:42.000 --> 31:44.000\nHe doesn't have to do anything.\n\n31:44.000 --> 31:47.000\nHe has like fast and furious seven turrets\n\n31:47.000 --> 31:49.000\nthat come out of this.\n\n31:49.000 --> 31:51.000\nHe just shoots sideways.\n\n31:51.000 --> 31:55.000\nAnyways, okay, so it's a San Diego Comic Con podcast\n\n31:55.000 --> 31:58.000\nand you're getting a lot of fast bits.\n\n31:58.000 --> 32:01.000\nOkay, alright, you ever seen a commercial,\n\n32:01.000 --> 32:03.000\nlike a Mountain Dew commercial or a Chip commercial\n\n32:03.000 --> 32:07.000\nwhere a kid rides a bike up a ramp\n\n32:07.000 --> 32:09.000\nand then he does a somersault on the bike\n\n32:09.000 --> 32:12.000\nand then the whole bike and him go into the ocean?\n\n32:12.000 --> 32:13.000\nWhere does the bike go?\n\n32:13.000 --> 32:15.000\nWhat does he do with the...\n\n32:15.000 --> 32:19.000\nIs there a bunch of bikes down there?\n\n32:19.000 --> 32:23.000\nDoes he have to swim with the bike like he's rescuing it?\n\n32:23.000 --> 32:25.000\nWhat a dumb thing to do.\n\n32:25.000 --> 32:28.000\nDangerous and stupid.\n\n32:28.000 --> 32:32.000\nAre you worried about the bikes or about the ecology?\n\n32:32.000 --> 32:35.000\nI think I'm worried about the earth, yeah.\n\n32:35.000 --> 32:37.000\nI think once we solve all our other problems\n\n32:37.000 --> 32:40.000\nwe're gonna have to deal with this mountain of bikes.\n\n32:40.000 --> 32:43.000\nIf anybody had the time or the energy, go to Huntington Beach, California\n\n32:43.000 --> 32:46.000\nwhere I spent most of my time ditching high school\n\n32:46.000 --> 32:50.000\nand most of my wallets are there.\n\n32:50.000 --> 32:52.000\nAbout 20 yards out.\n\n32:52.000 --> 32:55.000\nI kept going into the water with a wallet in my pocket\n\n32:55.000 --> 32:57.000\nand you come out with no wallet.\n\n32:57.000 --> 32:58.000\nThey're all there.\n\n32:58.000 --> 33:00.000\nYou think there's pickpockets down there?\n\n33:00.000 --> 33:02.000\nIt's those fish, man.\n\n33:02.000 --> 33:04.000\nOh, your wallets are out.\n\n33:04.000 --> 33:05.000\nThey just fall out.\n\n33:05.000 --> 33:07.000\nYeah, it was in a pocket.\n\n33:07.000 --> 33:11.000\nOkay, how do you feel about the Bloody Mary Arms Race?\n\n33:11.000 --> 33:13.000\nAbout putting shit in the Bloody Mary?\n\n33:13.000 --> 33:14.000\nYeah.\n\n33:14.000 --> 33:17.000\nI feel, you start all fucking follow-up.\n\n33:17.000 --> 33:19.000\nI feel very strongly about it.\n\n33:19.000 --> 33:21.000\nIn Portland, you order a Bloody Mary.\n\n33:21.000 --> 33:24.000\nAnd it comes with a sandwich on it and the whole thing, yeah.\n\n33:24.000 --> 33:26.000\nLike everybody's in this arms race.\n\n33:26.000 --> 33:28.000\nA Bloody Mary should be a small drink.\n\n33:28.000 --> 33:30.000\nIt shouldn't be a giant, I know there's bartenders here\n\n33:30.000 --> 33:32.000\nand I don't want you guys to be offended.\n\n33:32.000 --> 33:35.000\nIt should not be in a pint glass with ice and a bunch of shit in it.\n\n33:35.000 --> 33:37.000\nIt should be in a small, high bar glass.\n\n33:37.000 --> 33:39.000\nIt should be chilled with a lemon.\n\n33:39.000 --> 33:41.000\nAnd that's it.\n\n33:41.000 --> 33:42.000\nRight?\n\n33:42.000 --> 33:44.000\nWas that Logan?\n\n33:44.000 --> 33:46.000\nWho was that?\n\n33:46.000 --> 33:49.000\nIt should be restorative drink.\n\n33:49.000 --> 33:52.000\nYou drink that one to get your shit back together\n\n33:52.000 --> 33:54.000\nso you can start drinking booze again.\n\n33:54.000 --> 33:55.000\nLike a real drink.\n\n33:55.000 --> 33:58.000\nYou shouldn't have a 19-ounce Bloody Mary with a cheeseburger on it.\n\n33:58.000 --> 34:00.000\nThere's places with a turkey leg dipped in it\n\n34:00.000 --> 34:03.000\nand then there's like two snorkels coming out.\n\n34:03.000 --> 34:08.000\nIf you tell a bartender, I just want it chilled up in a glass with a lemon.\n\n34:08.000 --> 34:10.000\nThey look at you like you're fucking crazy.\n\n34:10.000 --> 34:13.000\nThat you don't want 19 things hanging off the side of it.\n\n34:13.000 --> 34:15.000\nFucking kill everybody.\n\n34:15.000 --> 34:16.000\nAlright.\n\n34:16.000 --> 34:18.000\nFinal beverage question.\n\n34:18.000 --> 34:20.000\nThis ends my segment.\n\n34:20.000 --> 34:22.000\nOur whole show's a segment.\n\n34:22.000 --> 34:26.000\nA lot of these kids out here, they're younger than us.\n\n34:26.000 --> 34:28.000\nBut they went to schools.\n\n34:28.000 --> 34:30.000\nI just want to ask, I just got very curious about this\n\n34:30.000 --> 34:32.000\nbecause I was remembering my cafeteria days.\n\n34:32.000 --> 34:37.000\nHave they made these half pint milk cartons easier to fucking open yet?\n\n34:37.000 --> 34:39.000\nOr do you still have to...\n\n34:39.000 --> 34:41.000\nThere's like 25% of them.\n\n34:41.000 --> 34:44.000\nYou have to rip open like Wolverine to get in the...\n\n34:44.000 --> 34:46.000\nYou look like a fucking asshole.\n\n34:46.000 --> 34:49.000\nWhy do the jocks always know how to do it better?\n\n34:49.000 --> 34:52.000\nWhat are we doing wrong?\n\n34:52.000 --> 34:53.000\nIs it still that?\n\n34:53.000 --> 34:55.000\nIt's just a bunch of glue and paper\n\n34:55.000 --> 34:58.000\nand you just have to take the luck of the draw?\n\n34:58.000 --> 34:59.000\nOkay, just checking.\n\n34:59.000 --> 35:03.000\nYeah, why would they change that? Who's going to profit from that?\n\n35:03.000 --> 35:05.000\nThey put water on cartons.\n\n35:05.000 --> 35:07.000\nAre they easier to open or is it the same?\n\n35:07.000 --> 35:08.000\nYeah.\n\n35:08.000 --> 35:12.000\nThey make you drink water out of a half pint carton?\n\n35:12.000 --> 35:17.000\nIt's better for the earth.\n\n35:17.000 --> 35:20.000\nWhat about water fountains?\n\n35:20.000 --> 35:22.000\nThat's worse for the earth?\n\n35:22.000 --> 35:24.000\nPlastic bottles.\n\n35:24.000 --> 35:27.000\nBut I mean, what about the water fountains?\n\n35:27.000 --> 35:30.000\nThey never served me water in the cafeteria.\n\n35:30.000 --> 35:33.000\nI don't know what conversation this is.\n\n35:37.000 --> 35:41.000\nThey never served you water at the cafeteria?\n\n35:41.000 --> 35:43.000\nYeah. No, they did not.\n\n35:43.000 --> 35:44.000\nNo.\n\n35:44.000 --> 35:48.000\nSo why are they putting water in half pint cardboard cartons?\n\n35:48.000 --> 35:50.000\nTo save the earth.\n\n35:50.000 --> 35:51.000\nFrom what?\n\n35:51.000 --> 35:52.000\nFrom plastic.\n\n35:52.000 --> 35:55.000\nThey don't give you plastic bottles in the cafeteria.\n\n35:55.000 --> 35:57.000\nOkay, they do now? Well, that's their problem.\n\n35:57.000 --> 35:59.000\nThey should stop doing that.\n\n35:59.000 --> 36:03.000\nAre we only talking about in the schools?\n\n36:03.000 --> 36:06.000\nBecause I feel like I've seen them in stores.\n\n36:06.000 --> 36:08.000\nYou know, like bigger ones.\n\n36:08.000 --> 36:10.000\nRight, bigger. Yes, that I get.\n\n36:10.000 --> 36:12.000\nI'm talking about in schools.\n\n36:12.000 --> 36:13.000\nCafeteria.\n\n36:13.000 --> 36:16.000\nMock chicken leg and your green beans and your ketchup.\n\n36:16.000 --> 36:19.000\nWait, the kids ones are the easiest to open at any carton.\n\n36:19.000 --> 36:22.000\nIt's those minute-made ones from Jack in the Box\n\n36:22.000 --> 36:24.000\nthat are the real problem.\n\n36:24.000 --> 36:27.000\nFifth, that's the real problem.\n\n36:27.000 --> 36:28.000\nLet me tell you.\n\n36:28.000 --> 36:30.000\nAlso, I've read poachers.\n\n36:30.000 --> 36:35.000\nOkay, I want to bring up a guy that I met at a signing.\n\n36:35.000 --> 36:37.000\nBecause I hope he's here.\n\n36:37.000 --> 36:42.000\nHe came up and he was getting his Rick and Morty stuff signed.\n\n36:42.000 --> 36:46.000\nAnd then he asked Justin and I, Justin and me,\n\n36:46.000 --> 36:48.000\nJustin and you.\n\n36:48.000 --> 36:51.000\nJustin and we.\n\n36:51.000 --> 36:54.000\nHe got the signature and then he said,\n\n36:54.000 --> 36:59.000\nby the way, what are each of your guys' favorite Tom Petty songs?\n\n36:59.000 --> 37:02.000\nAnd Justin answered and then I said,\n\n37:02.000 --> 37:04.000\nI guess Free Fallen, I don't know,\n\n37:04.000 --> 37:07.000\nwhich Dino told me today was the wrong answer.\n\n37:07.000 --> 37:10.000\nBut at any rate, he took the two answers\n\n37:10.000 --> 37:12.000\nand then he was like, okay, thanks.\n\n37:12.000 --> 37:15.000\nI started to walk away and I was like, get back here.\n\n37:15.000 --> 37:16.000\nWhy?\n\n37:16.000 --> 37:18.000\nYou do get to ask me that.\n\n37:18.000 --> 37:21.000\nAnd he said, oh, I'm just really into Tom Petty and I really,\n\n37:21.000 --> 37:25.000\nI always ask everybody that.\n\n37:25.000 --> 37:27.000\nAnd I was like, can you please, are you coming to the show\n\n37:27.000 --> 37:30.000\nand will you please come up and, you know,\n\n37:30.000 --> 37:32.000\nbeing passionate about something so specific,\n\n37:32.000 --> 37:34.000\nlike I just like to meet these people.\n\n37:34.000 --> 37:35.000\nIs Robert here?\n\n37:35.000 --> 37:36.000\nRobert, are you here?\n\n37:36.000 --> 37:37.000\nNo?\n\n37:37.000 --> 37:38.000\nNope.\n\n37:38.000 --> 37:39.000\nOh, he shot his family.\n\n37:39.000 --> 37:40.000\nOkay.\n\n37:40.000 --> 37:44.000\nWait, he didn't come?\n\n37:44.000 --> 37:46.000\nHe turned Free Fallen up to 11.\n\n37:46.000 --> 37:48.000\nAnd I'm free.\n\n37:48.000 --> 37:54.000\nFree Fallen running down a dream.\n\n37:54.000 --> 37:58.000\nDon't come around here no more.\n\n37:58.000 --> 38:00.000\nWait, did you invite him to the show\n\n38:00.000 --> 38:01.000\nand he didn't fucking come?\n\n38:01.000 --> 38:03.000\nHe said he was going to be at the show.\n\n38:03.000 --> 38:04.000\nI wouldn't invite him to the show.\n\n38:04.000 --> 38:06.000\nThese people went through hell and back\n\n38:06.000 --> 38:11.000\nto get into the show.\n\n38:11.000 --> 38:13.000\nBut I thought he was going to be here.\n\n38:13.000 --> 38:16.000\nI went to go see the Jeff Lynn documentary\n\n38:16.000 --> 38:18.000\ncalled Mr. Blue Sky, which is great.\n\n38:18.000 --> 38:21.000\nAnd I was standing at Nokia Live,\n\n38:21.000 --> 38:22.000\nlike a small theater.\n\n38:22.000 --> 38:24.000\nAnd I was standing in a little corridor.\n\n38:24.000 --> 38:26.000\nAnd we were so rammed together.\n\n38:26.000 --> 38:28.000\nThere was a short guy next to me with a hat.\n\n38:28.000 --> 38:30.000\nAnd I couldn't see his face because he was shorter than me.\n\n38:30.000 --> 38:32.000\nHe had a big hat, a Gandalf hair.\n\n38:32.000 --> 38:35.000\nAnd he was smoking early days vape pen.\n\n38:35.000 --> 38:37.000\nBut it was clearly like weed.\n\n38:37.000 --> 38:39.000\nAnd he's like, hey man, you want some?\n\n38:39.000 --> 38:41.000\nI was like, what is it?\n\n38:41.000 --> 38:42.000\nMarijuana?\n\n38:42.000 --> 38:44.000\nI go, no, that'll get me too high.\n\n38:44.000 --> 38:45.000\nI get too high in marijuana.\n\n38:45.000 --> 38:46.000\nI go, hash it.\n\n38:46.000 --> 38:47.000\nAnd he goes, oh shit.\n\n38:47.000 --> 38:49.000\nIf you know him when he has any hash, oh fuck off.\n\n38:49.000 --> 38:50.000\nI want that hash.\n\n38:50.000 --> 38:51.000\nOh, man.\n\n38:51.000 --> 38:52.000\nI couldn't see his face.\n\n38:52.000 --> 38:53.000\nHe had a big brim hat.\n\n38:53.000 --> 38:55.000\nAnd I was like, who the fuck is this guy?\n\n38:55.000 --> 38:57.000\nHe's American, so he's not in ELO.\n\n38:57.000 --> 38:59.000\nWho the fuck is this guy?\n\n38:59.000 --> 39:00.000\nHe sits down in front of me.\n\n39:00.000 --> 39:05.000\nHe's fucking Tom Petty.\n\n39:05.000 --> 39:06.000\nI was like, I was so happy.\n\n39:06.000 --> 39:08.000\nI didn't know that it was Tom Petty.\n\n39:08.000 --> 39:10.000\nBecause I would never have been that glib\n\n39:10.000 --> 39:12.000\nand chatty with him.\n\n39:12.000 --> 39:14.000\nI would have been freaking out the whole time.\n\n39:14.000 --> 39:15.000\nHe just wanted to be like, yeah,\n\n39:15.000 --> 39:17.000\nif you can score some hash oil, man,\n\n39:17.000 --> 39:20.000\nlet's fucking do that shit.\n\n39:20.000 --> 39:21.000\nWhat if he just kept bugging you\n\n39:21.000 --> 39:22.000\nfor the rest of your life?\n\n39:22.000 --> 39:24.000\nHe was like, hey, Tom.\n\n39:24.000 --> 39:25.000\nI found some hash oil.\n\n39:25.000 --> 39:28.000\nI thought we had an agreement.\n\n39:28.000 --> 39:30.000\nI mean, I guess I picked wrong with Free Fall\n\n39:30.000 --> 39:31.000\nand I don't know.\n\n39:31.000 --> 39:33.000\nBecause Dino was going like, that's the wrong side.\n\n39:33.000 --> 39:34.000\nI'm like, what would you pick?\n\n39:34.000 --> 39:36.000\nAnd he's like, I can't remember what he said.\n\n39:36.000 --> 39:37.000\nBut he said, I won't back down.\n\n39:37.000 --> 39:39.000\nI'm like, well, that's just whining.\n\n39:39.000 --> 39:42.000\nAlso, isn't there a bit where like,\n\n39:42.000 --> 39:44.000\nmost of Tom Petty's songs have the word\n\n39:44.000 --> 39:45.000\ndown in the title?\n\n39:45.000 --> 39:46.000\nThere's like a lot of them.\n\n39:46.000 --> 39:47.000\nThere's Running Down a Dream.\n\n39:47.000 --> 39:48.000\nI won't back down.\n\n39:48.000 --> 39:49.000\nI think there's a bunch more.\n\n39:49.000 --> 39:51.000\nBut the only part of Free Fall that I like\n\n39:51.000 --> 39:53.000\nis when he actually literally says,\n\n39:53.000 --> 39:54.000\nand I'm free, Free Falling,\n\n39:54.000 --> 39:56.000\nbecause the rest of the song is like Bad Mountain Goats,\n\n39:56.000 --> 39:59.000\nkind of like over specific geographic stuff.\n\n39:59.000 --> 40:02.000\nI was like, I'm on, I'm on first street\n\n40:02.000 --> 40:05.000\neating pretzel.\n\n40:05.000 --> 40:08.000\nThere's a goat leash and a shoe on my foot.\n\n40:08.000 --> 40:11.000\nThat's like an old singer thing.\n\n40:11.000 --> 40:13.000\nThey run out of chops,\n\n40:13.000 --> 40:15.000\nand then they just start fucking grinding\n\n40:15.000 --> 40:16.000\nat specificity.\n\n40:16.000 --> 40:19.000\nThey're like, I'm on third and Wabash\n\n40:19.000 --> 40:22.000\nin 2252, Recita.\n\n40:22.000 --> 40:26.000\nI know that's something old people do.\n\n40:26.000 --> 40:28.000\nThere's some plywood,\n\n40:28.000 --> 40:32.000\nand it costs 3.99 a pound at Home Depot,\n\n40:32.000 --> 40:35.000\non Ventura Boulevard.\n\n40:35.000 --> 40:39.000\nWhenever you're getting geographically specific,\n\n40:39.000 --> 40:42.000\nyou're blying some fucking,\n\n40:42.000 --> 40:45.000\nbecause young kids, we love music by 22-year-olds\n\n40:45.000 --> 40:47.000\nthat are, you listen to the lyrics of the songs we love,\n\n40:47.000 --> 40:51.000\nand they're just like, I won't let you down.\n\n40:51.000 --> 40:54.000\nI love you so much.\n\n40:54.000 --> 40:55.000\nAnd we're like, you're adorable,\n\n40:55.000 --> 40:56.000\nand this is awesome,\n\n40:56.000 --> 40:58.000\nand I'm going to have sex to this song.\n\n40:58.000 --> 41:01.000\nBut they're not poets.\n\n41:01.000 --> 41:03.000\nThey don't have to be, because they're young.\n\n41:03.000 --> 41:09.000\nBut old people are just like, September 3rd.\n\n41:09.000 --> 41:13.000\nThe day after Mother's Day.\n\n41:13.000 --> 41:17.000\nThe barometric pressure was 72%.\n\n41:17.000 --> 41:21.000\nI get into my Chevy 57 Impala.\n\n41:21.000 --> 41:23.000\nLike, stop telling me all this shit.\n\n41:23.000 --> 41:26.000\nLike, get your shit out of my fucking brain.\n\n41:26.000 --> 41:28.000\nJust tell me what it feels to be alive.\n\n41:28.000 --> 41:29.000\nYou don't know, do you?\n\n41:29.000 --> 41:31.000\nYou don't know.\n\n41:31.000 --> 41:33.000\nYou just have memories of random shit.\n\n41:33.000 --> 41:35.000\nThat's what Alzheimer's patients do.\n\n41:35.000 --> 41:37.000\nI remember a fuzzy slipper.\n\n41:37.000 --> 41:40.000\nMom, go to bed.\n\n41:40.000 --> 41:42.000\nDo you want to have sex?\n\n41:42.000 --> 41:45.000\nI'm your son, go to bed.\n\n41:45.000 --> 41:48.000\nBut Howard Hughes is about to sing Winky Doodle.\n\n41:48.000 --> 41:49.000\nYou're wrong.\n\n41:49.000 --> 41:52.000\nThat's George Gershwin.\n\n41:52.000 --> 41:54.000\nYou pick the wrong song.\n\n41:54.000 --> 41:56.000\nYou pick the one that's all specific.\n\n41:56.000 --> 42:01.000\nAnd the part that's like, free, free falling.\n\n42:01.000 --> 42:03.000\nBecause Tom Penny's whiny.\n\n42:03.000 --> 42:05.000\nAnd so if you're going to whine about something,\n\n42:05.000 --> 42:06.000\nwhine about being free.\n\n42:06.000 --> 42:08.000\nHim saying I won't back down is kind of like,\n\n42:08.000 --> 42:11.000\nyou just sound stubborn.\n\n42:11.000 --> 42:13.000\nJohnny Cash singing I won't back down,\n\n42:13.000 --> 42:14.000\nit sounds badass.\n\n42:14.000 --> 42:16.000\nI won't back down.\n\n42:16.000 --> 42:20.000\nLike, oh shit, this guy's going to stop apartheid.\n\n42:20.000 --> 42:21.000\nOr something.\n\n42:21.000 --> 42:25.000\nHe won't back down from fucking, from the third rite.\n\n42:25.000 --> 42:27.000\nLike, it sounds badass.\n\n42:27.000 --> 42:30.000\nTom Penny is like, when he said I won't back down,\n\n42:30.000 --> 42:32.000\nit sounds like he didn't get the right kind of mustard\n\n42:32.000 --> 42:33.000\nor something.\n\n42:33.000 --> 42:36.000\nEh, I want a refund.\n\n42:36.000 --> 42:39.000\nI'm not leaving here without my money back.\n\n42:39.000 --> 42:41.000\nI won't back down.\n\n42:41.000 --> 42:43.000\nI'm putting my foot down.\n\n42:43.000 --> 42:46.000\nBecause I'm a consumer watchdog.\n\n42:46.000 --> 42:49.000\nAnd I won't back down.\n\n42:49.000 --> 42:52.000\nAnd if you go on to my Tumblr blog,\n\n42:52.000 --> 42:59.000\nyou can see the other companies I've written to.\n\n42:59.000 --> 43:03.000\nI won't shop at Fry's, baby.\n\n43:03.000 --> 43:06.000\nTheir customer service is rude.\n\n43:06.000 --> 43:08.000\nHow do you film a Bob Dylan?\n\n43:08.000 --> 43:10.000\nAre you a Bob Dylan fan?\n\n43:10.000 --> 43:12.000\nI guess I missed out on that.\n\n43:12.000 --> 43:14.000\nI'm sure he was very ironic and interesting\n\n43:14.000 --> 43:17.000\nwhen, in 1928?\n\n43:17.000 --> 43:18.000\nYeah.\n\n43:18.000 --> 43:20.000\nThat was his early stuff.\n\n43:20.000 --> 43:23.000\nThat was certainly his very early stuff.\n\n43:23.000 --> 43:24.000\nI get it.\n\n43:24.000 --> 43:26.000\nI mean, I guess Easy Writer's a good movie.\n\n43:26.000 --> 43:27.000\nI don't know.\n\n43:27.000 --> 43:29.000\nNo, I'm saying, I'm comparing the two.\n\n43:29.000 --> 43:31.000\nI'm not saying Bob Dylan was an Easy Writer.\n\n43:31.000 --> 43:34.000\nBut I'm saying, like, there's shit that you miss the boat on\n\n43:34.000 --> 43:36.000\nand you kind of historically look and go,\n\n43:36.000 --> 43:38.000\noh, okay, I understand the significance.\n\n43:38.000 --> 43:40.000\nWhat's your guilty pleasure at home?\n\n43:40.000 --> 43:44.000\nLike, your music, if you're alone and want to wallow.\n\n43:44.000 --> 43:45.000\nI'm assuming, like, you and I,\n\n43:45.000 --> 43:47.000\nI think we both have talked about this before.\n\n43:47.000 --> 43:49.000\nWe like sad songs.\n\n43:49.000 --> 43:51.000\nWho's your guilty pleasure?\n\n43:51.000 --> 43:54.000\nI've listened to Dream Pop and, like,\n\n43:54.000 --> 43:56.000\nI mean, now I listen to, like, shit that,\n\n43:56.000 --> 43:58.000\nto me, is modern, but then Aaron goes,\n\n43:58.000 --> 44:00.000\nthat's from 2006.\n\n44:00.000 --> 44:02.000\nI listened to that in grade school.\n\n44:02.000 --> 44:05.000\nHow old is she?\n\n44:05.000 --> 44:08.000\nI'm really into the postal service or whatever.\n\n44:08.000 --> 44:12.000\nI'm like, man, I hope my wife over here is this.\n\n44:12.000 --> 44:13.000\nShe's going to get turned on.\n\n44:13.000 --> 44:15.000\nI'm very young and hip.\n\n44:15.000 --> 44:18.000\nAnd she's like, that's what, the Beetlejuice was in theaters.\n\n44:18.000 --> 44:22.000\nLike, why are you...\n\n44:22.000 --> 44:24.000\nBut, yeah, I don't know.\n\n44:24.000 --> 44:25.000\nI like moody sad songs.\n\n44:25.000 --> 44:26.000\nSpencer, how about you?\n\n44:26.000 --> 44:28.000\nWhat's your go-to?\n\n44:28.000 --> 44:30.000\nWhen you're at home, do you play music?\n\n44:30.000 --> 44:33.000\nNo, I mean, when I'm driving around,\n\n44:33.000 --> 44:36.000\nI listen to either NPR, which is...\n\n44:36.000 --> 44:42.000\nYeah, they do music, too, so it's not just that.\n\n44:42.000 --> 44:43.000\nAnd then also...\n\n44:43.000 --> 44:44.000\nI think it's going to be the first show\n\n44:44.000 --> 44:46.000\nwhere people have screamed and it wounded for NPR.\n\n44:46.000 --> 44:48.000\nI doubt that, man.\n\n44:48.000 --> 44:51.000\nNPR is great.\n\n44:51.000 --> 44:54.000\nHave you heard...\n\n44:54.000 --> 44:56.000\nI heard a piece on NPR.\n\n44:56.000 --> 44:57.000\nI don't know if this is true.\n\n44:57.000 --> 44:59.000\nI don't know how scientifically accurate this is.\n\n44:59.000 --> 45:00.000\nIt's true.\n\n45:00.000 --> 45:04.000\nBut supposedly, the morning is becoming less and less eclectic.\n\n45:04.000 --> 45:05.000\nNo.\n\n45:05.000 --> 45:06.000\nYeah.\n\n45:06.000 --> 45:09.000\nIt's by, like, six inches a year.\n\n45:09.000 --> 45:10.000\nOkay.\n\n45:10.000 --> 45:14.000\nYeah, by 2019, the morning won't be eclectic.\n\n45:14.000 --> 45:16.000\nIt's true.\n\n45:16.000 --> 45:19.000\nIt's thanks to Chris Doritos.\n\n45:19.000 --> 45:23.000\nYou guys don't listen to Morning Becomes Eclectic this week.\n\n45:23.000 --> 45:24.000\nYou'd know.\n\n45:24.000 --> 45:27.000\nHe's sitting in for Jason Bentley.\n\n45:27.000 --> 45:28.000\nThey don't get up that early.\n\n45:28.000 --> 45:31.000\nSee, they know who Jason Bentley is.\n\n45:31.000 --> 45:33.000\nWell, these guys do.\n\n45:33.000 --> 45:36.000\nDan, if you could be in a band, like a big rock band,\n\n45:36.000 --> 45:38.000\nlike a major thing, would you be lead singer,\n\n45:38.000 --> 45:42.000\nguitar, drums, bass, laying in the background,\n\n45:42.000 --> 45:45.000\nkeyboard, background singer, maybe?\n\n45:45.000 --> 45:46.000\nLike, background vocals.\n\n45:46.000 --> 45:49.000\nWhat would you be if you could be in a huge band?\n\n45:49.000 --> 45:54.000\nWell, are we in this hypothetical universe?\n\n45:54.000 --> 45:56.000\nDoes my talent knows no bounds and also...\n\n45:56.000 --> 45:59.000\nYou could be as good or as bad as you want to be.\n\n45:59.000 --> 46:01.000\nWell, I'd be the lead singer.\n\n46:01.000 --> 46:02.000\nOkay.\n\n46:02.000 --> 46:05.000\nAnd so would every bass player.\n\n46:05.000 --> 46:07.000\nIf they could.\n\n46:07.000 --> 46:10.000\nOtherwise, why are they on stage?\n\n46:10.000 --> 46:13.000\nI wish I was singing.\n\n46:13.000 --> 46:16.000\nTheir personalities, they would rather be slightly...\n\n46:16.000 --> 46:19.000\nI don't believe that's true at all.\n\n46:19.000 --> 46:23.000\nRock bands are like five people.\n\n46:23.000 --> 46:27.000\nIf you show me the second chair violinist,\n\n46:27.000 --> 46:30.000\nthe LA Philharmonic, I'll believe that she doesn't wish\n\n46:30.000 --> 46:33.000\nthat she was David Lee Roth.\n\n46:33.000 --> 46:36.000\nI don't believe that Dave Grohl didn't wish he was Kurt Cobain.\n\n46:36.000 --> 46:44.000\nThat's not as soon as fucking right on time.\n\n46:44.000 --> 46:46.000\nI don't believe it.\n\n46:46.000 --> 46:49.000\nI think rock bands are the reason they're fun to watch\n\n46:49.000 --> 46:52.000\nis because there's five dudes who all hate each other\n\n46:52.000 --> 46:53.000\nand wish that they...\n\n46:53.000 --> 46:55.000\nI know musicians that are happy.\n\n46:55.000 --> 46:56.000\nThey're happy.\n\n46:56.000 --> 46:59.000\nI want to be on stage, but I would never want the onus\n\n46:59.000 --> 47:01.000\nof being the front woman.\n\n47:01.000 --> 47:04.000\nBut why is it an onus if you're so good?\n\n47:04.000 --> 47:07.000\nThat's why I asked, am I so good that I don't have to worry about shit?\n\n47:07.000 --> 47:10.000\nThen, yeah, I'll take all the attention.\n\n47:10.000 --> 47:13.000\nKeanu Reeves told me we were very drunk in Vegas one time.\n\n47:13.000 --> 47:14.000\nHe's like...\n\n47:14.000 --> 47:17.000\nHoly crap.\n\n47:17.000 --> 47:18.000\nHe's like...\n\n47:18.000 --> 47:20.000\nHis favorite thing is playing bass.\n\n47:20.000 --> 47:22.000\nHe likes playing bass and not...\n\n47:22.000 --> 47:23.000\nHe doesn't charm the crowd.\n\n47:23.000 --> 47:24.000\nHe doesn't rock out.\n\n47:24.000 --> 47:25.000\nHe just hangs his head down.\n\n47:25.000 --> 47:27.000\nThis is back in the Dog Star days.\n\n47:27.000 --> 47:28.000\nIt was a long time ago.\n\n47:28.000 --> 47:30.000\nAnd he goes, he's like, Jeff, being in a band\n\n47:30.000 --> 47:32.000\nis the greatest thing in the world.\n\n47:32.000 --> 47:34.000\nHe'd rather use that than be a movie star.\n\n47:34.000 --> 47:36.000\nIf he had his way, he would be\n\n47:36.000 --> 47:38.000\nsecond-settled hair in his face\n\n47:38.000 --> 47:39.000\nand no one knew that he...\n\n47:39.000 --> 47:42.000\nThat doesn't mean that if God came down with a magic wand\n\n47:42.000 --> 47:44.000\nand touched his throat\n\n47:44.000 --> 47:47.000\nand made him sound like Frank Sinatra,\n\n47:47.000 --> 47:48.000\nhe wouldn't be like...\n\n47:48.000 --> 47:51.000\nI'd still just want to play bass.\n\n47:51.000 --> 47:53.000\nHe'd be like...\n\n47:53.000 --> 47:55.000\nOh, shoot, I guess I'm the best at this.\n\n47:57.000 --> 48:00.000\nA lot of drummers that I know don't want to be up front.\n\n48:00.000 --> 48:02.000\nBut are they good singers?\n\n48:02.000 --> 48:03.000\nAre they good singers?\n\n48:03.000 --> 48:04.000\nNo, they want to drum.\n\n48:04.000 --> 48:05.000\nThey want to do that.\n\n48:05.000 --> 48:06.000\nI know, but if they could...\n\n48:06.000 --> 48:07.000\nLook at Phil Collins.\n\n48:07.000 --> 48:09.000\nHe's croaking out shit while he's drumming.\n\n48:09.000 --> 48:10.000\nHe's like...\n\n48:10.000 --> 48:11.000\nBy applause.\n\n48:11.000 --> 48:12.000\nAre there musicians here\n\n48:12.000 --> 48:14.000\nthat don't want to be a lead singer\n\n48:14.000 --> 48:16.000\nand would rather be doing else?\n\n48:16.000 --> 48:19.000\nYou're just getting lies.\n\n48:21.000 --> 48:23.000\nHe's called all those people liars.\n\n48:23.000 --> 48:26.000\nThere's a difference between asking people\n\n48:26.000 --> 48:31.000\nif you could be at the spotlight,\n\n48:31.000 --> 48:33.000\nwould you take it?\n\n48:33.000 --> 48:34.000\nAnd asking them,\n\n48:34.000 --> 48:38.000\nare you very happy to take a backseat?\n\n48:38.000 --> 48:39.000\nWhen I was working on...\n\n48:39.000 --> 48:41.000\nI think there are people that don't want the spotlight\n\n48:41.000 --> 48:43.000\nunder any circumstances.\n\n48:43.000 --> 48:46.000\nYou're taking a position that's very hard\n\n48:46.000 --> 48:49.000\nto disagree with without being uncharismatic\n\n48:49.000 --> 48:52.000\nbecause I'm taking the elitist position.\n\n48:52.000 --> 48:53.000\nBut I will say,\n\n48:53.000 --> 48:56.000\nin support of your point,\n\n48:56.000 --> 49:02.000\nwhen I was working on the 81st Oscars,\n\n49:02.000 --> 49:05.000\nwhich I guess I probably...\n\n49:05.000 --> 49:07.000\nI was...\n\n49:07.000 --> 49:08.000\nJack Black called me down\n\n49:08.000 --> 49:10.000\nbecause he wanted me to write his pattern,\n\n49:10.000 --> 49:12.000\nand he was presenting with Jennifer Aniston.\n\n49:12.000 --> 49:14.000\nAnd I had a headset out on a little clipboard,\n\n49:14.000 --> 49:15.000\nand it was like,\n\n49:15.000 --> 49:17.000\noh boy, I got to go down and see Mrs. Aniston\n\n49:17.000 --> 49:19.000\nand Mr. Black.\n\n49:19.000 --> 49:21.000\nAnd they were like...\n\n49:21.000 --> 49:22.000\nI wrote a joke for them,\n\n49:22.000 --> 49:23.000\nand then they were like,\n\n49:23.000 --> 49:24.000\nthey didn't like the joke,\n\n49:24.000 --> 49:25.000\nand I had to rewrite it.\n\n49:25.000 --> 49:26.000\nAnd I was very...\n\n49:26.000 --> 49:27.000\nIn that moment,\n\n49:27.000 --> 49:28.000\nI was very activated.\n\n49:28.000 --> 49:29.000\nI liked it.\n\n49:29.000 --> 49:32.000\nAnd if you had stuck a thermometer in me at that point,\n\n49:32.000 --> 49:33.000\nand asked,\n\n49:33.000 --> 49:34.000\nare you miserable?\n\n49:34.000 --> 49:35.000\nDo you hate them?\n\n49:35.000 --> 49:37.000\nDo you wish you were presenting at the Oscars?\n\n49:37.000 --> 49:38.000\nI wouldn't have said yes.\n\n49:38.000 --> 49:41.000\nI was happy in my position.\n\n49:41.000 --> 49:42.000\nI felt supportive.\n\n49:42.000 --> 49:43.000\nI felt activated.\n\n49:43.000 --> 49:44.000\nI felt content.\n\n49:44.000 --> 49:46.000\nThat's different from saying,\n\n49:46.000 --> 49:49.000\nwould you switch places with Jennifer Aniston?\n\n49:49.000 --> 49:51.000\nWhich I would.\n\n49:51.000 --> 49:54.000\nWhat's the first thing you would do\n\n49:54.000 --> 49:57.000\nif you were suddenly Jennifer Aniston?\n\n49:57.000 --> 49:59.000\nOh, so much.\n\n49:59.000 --> 50:05.000\nI would start by making health care socialized.\n\n50:05.000 --> 50:08.000\nWhy do you think she hasn't already done that?\n\n50:08.000 --> 50:11.000\nI'm sure she has in her little neck of the woods,\n\n50:11.000 --> 50:12.000\nbut like,\n\n50:12.000 --> 50:15.000\nI would use her power for good.\n\n50:15.000 --> 50:17.000\nI don't know.\n\n50:17.000 --> 50:20.000\nThis conversation is dumb.\n\n50:20.000 --> 50:25.000\nI would suspect that you and I would both want to be lead singers,\n\n50:25.000 --> 50:27.000\nbut there are people that would rather play drums\n\n50:27.000 --> 50:28.000\nand rather be,\n\n50:28.000 --> 50:29.000\nright?\n\n50:29.000 --> 50:30.000\nThis guy?\n\n50:30.000 --> 50:32.000\nLogan.\n\n50:32.000 --> 50:34.000\nFucking Logan.\n\n50:34.000 --> 50:36.000\nI feel like,\n\n50:36.000 --> 50:39.000\nit's a very uncharismatic thing for me to say\n\n50:39.000 --> 50:41.000\nthat if you are a bass player,\n\n50:41.000 --> 50:43.000\nyou must wish you were a singer.\n\n50:43.000 --> 50:44.000\nIt's different from saying,\n\n50:44.000 --> 50:45.000\nI don't think that's,\n\n50:45.000 --> 50:46.000\nit's semantics.\n\n50:46.000 --> 50:49.000\nOur language doesn't have the nuance to divide those lines.\n\n50:49.000 --> 50:50.000\nWe're just saying like,\n\n50:50.000 --> 50:52.000\nif you like being on stage\n\n50:52.000 --> 50:53.000\nand you like playing an instrument\n\n50:53.000 --> 50:56.000\nand you like performing for people in a concert,\n\n50:56.000 --> 50:59.000\nif a fairy godmother like Tutt\n\n50:59.000 --> 51:01.000\nwould be able to transform you into a person\n\n51:01.000 --> 51:04.000\nwho had perfect pitch\n\n51:04.000 --> 51:06.000\nand amazing dance moves\n\n51:06.000 --> 51:09.000\nor beautiful hair\n\n51:09.000 --> 51:12.000\nor whatever it is that makes you feel like\n\n51:12.000 --> 51:15.000\nyou don't belong at the very front of the performance,\n\n51:15.000 --> 51:18.000\nwould you then do it?\n\n51:18.000 --> 51:20.000\nAnd at a certain point,\n\n51:20.000 --> 51:22.000\naren't you actually kind of,\n\n51:22.000 --> 51:25.000\nI mean being dishonest if you'd say no.\n\n51:25.000 --> 51:28.000\nYou're like, no, I want to stand behind\n\n51:28.000 --> 51:30.000\na lead singer\n\n51:30.000 --> 51:32.000\nand have everyone pointing at me and going,\n\n51:32.000 --> 51:35.000\nlet the bass player sing.\n\n51:35.000 --> 51:37.000\nI think that would come down to more just personalities,\n\n51:37.000 --> 51:38.000\nlike your own thing,\n\n51:38.000 --> 51:40.000\nlike let's say you had a great head of hair\n\n51:40.000 --> 51:42.000\nand a great voice and everything.\n\n51:42.000 --> 51:43.000\nAnd you still say, no,\n\n51:43.000 --> 51:46.000\nI would still like to be a role player,\n\n51:46.000 --> 51:48.000\nlike be the bass player, be the drummer,\n\n51:48.000 --> 51:52.000\nbe the cello, play a second violin.\n\n51:52.000 --> 51:54.000\nBut I think when you're in a band,\n\n51:54.000 --> 51:55.000\nlike you had said before,\n\n51:55.000 --> 51:56.000\nyou should always surround yourself\n\n51:56.000 --> 51:57.000\nwith people that intimidate you.\n\n51:57.000 --> 51:59.000\nSo if you are in a band\n\n51:59.000 --> 52:00.000\nand you're not like,\n\n52:00.000 --> 52:02.000\nand the guy that's actually the lead singer,\n\n52:02.000 --> 52:04.000\nif he's not a guy that you are like,\n\n52:04.000 --> 52:07.000\nman, I wish I could sing like that,\n\n52:07.000 --> 52:09.000\nthen you're not in the right band.\n\n52:09.000 --> 52:12.000\nLike you, if you're like,\n\n52:12.000 --> 52:15.000\nthis kid, he sings like shit,\n\n52:15.000 --> 52:16.000\nbut I'll let him.\n\n52:16.000 --> 52:17.000\nLike you're in the wrong band.\n\n52:17.000 --> 52:18.000\nYou're actually being an asshole\n\n52:18.000 --> 52:20.000\nby not quitting that band\n\n52:20.000 --> 52:21.000\nand going and finding a band\n\n52:21.000 --> 52:23.000\nwhere the lead singer is like,\n\n52:23.000 --> 52:26.000\nholy shit, this guy's a star.\n\n52:26.000 --> 52:29.000\nSo that, if you extend that train of thought,\n\n52:29.000 --> 52:32.000\nit's like, so if you magically,\n\n52:32.000 --> 52:35.000\nif you had those proclivities,\n\n52:35.000 --> 52:38.000\ninstead of your bass player proclivities,\n\n52:38.000 --> 52:41.000\nwhat position of the band would you play?\n\n52:41.000 --> 52:43.000\nIt's almost like a non-question\n\n52:43.000 --> 52:45.000\nbecause it's just sort of like, we all,\n\n52:45.000 --> 52:46.000\nwhat we want is an identity.\n\n52:46.000 --> 52:48.000\nWe want to be the guy dressed as Deadpool.\n\n52:48.000 --> 52:50.000\nWe want to be the guy that got fired by NBC.\n\n52:50.000 --> 52:53.000\nWe want to be the Mario guy.\n\n52:53.000 --> 52:54.000\nThe guy dressed as a banana.\n\n52:54.000 --> 52:56.000\nWe want to have a role.\n\n52:56.000 --> 52:58.000\nTasha wants to build her roofs.\n\n52:58.000 --> 53:01.000\nAll you want is a function\n\n53:01.000 --> 53:04.000\nand to know that you are,\n\n53:04.000 --> 53:05.000\nthat you're nailing it,\n\n53:05.000 --> 53:07.000\nthat you're doing the most you can\n\n53:07.000 --> 53:09.000\nand that if you're not succeeding\n\n53:09.000 --> 53:10.000\nas much as you can,\n\n53:10.000 --> 53:12.000\nthat you're still trying and getting better.\n\n53:12.000 --> 53:14.000\nEveryone wants to feel that way all the time.\n\n53:14.000 --> 53:16.000\nI don't think Keith Moon wanted to be a Roger D'Algerie.\n\n53:16.000 --> 53:18.000\nI think Keith Moon liked being Keith Moon.\n\n53:18.000 --> 53:21.000\nYou're just using examples that are...\n\n53:21.000 --> 53:23.000\nBut there's also like a garage band\n\n53:23.000 --> 53:25.000\nthat's just doing it for fun,\n\n53:25.000 --> 53:27.000\nwho's never going to, you know,\n\n53:27.000 --> 53:28.000\nwant to do actual shows.\n\n53:28.000 --> 53:30.000\nThere's a couple bands like that, right?\n\n53:30.000 --> 53:32.000\nThere's like three, I think, three.\n\n53:32.000 --> 53:34.000\nI don't want to be Dan.\n\n53:34.000 --> 53:38.000\nI know that without trying to go to the crowd,\n\n53:38.000 --> 53:40.000\nI know there are musicians here\n\n53:40.000 --> 53:43.000\nthat would be happily, never the lead singer.\n\n53:43.000 --> 53:45.000\nWe're talking in circles.\n\n53:45.000 --> 53:47.000\nI've circumscribed this whole thing\n\n53:47.000 --> 53:50.000\nand I'm smarter than everyone in the world.\n\n53:50.000 --> 53:52.000\nLike, I...\n\n53:52.000 --> 53:54.000\nThe way everyone here feels,\n\n53:54.000 --> 53:56.000\nI already feel that way.\n\n53:56.000 --> 53:58.000\nAnd more.\n\n53:58.000 --> 54:00.000\nThat's the bottom line.\n\n54:00.000 --> 54:02.000\nI feel everything.\n\n54:02.000 --> 54:04.000\nI know what it's like to be black.\n\n54:07.000 --> 54:09.000\nIt's hard.\n\n54:09.000 --> 54:11.000\nBut cool.\n\n54:11.000 --> 54:13.000\nThat track.\n\n54:13.000 --> 54:14.000\nSalty.\n\n54:14.000 --> 54:16.000\nAnd a little sweet.\n\n54:16.000 --> 54:19.000\nDan, okay, let's say that you were in the Philharmonic,\n\n54:19.000 --> 54:21.000\nin a big orchestra.\n\n54:21.000 --> 54:24.000\nWhere it's not about first chair,\n\n54:24.000 --> 54:27.000\nyou can be first chair anything you want.\n\n54:27.000 --> 54:29.000\nWhat instrument would you play if you could play anything?\n\n54:29.000 --> 54:30.000\nTuba.\n\n54:30.000 --> 54:31.000\nTuba?\n\n54:31.000 --> 54:32.000\nYeah.\n\n54:32.000 --> 54:34.000\nTuba or Suzertham?\n\n54:34.000 --> 54:36.000\nA suzertham!\n\n54:36.000 --> 54:39.000\nNo, fuck you guys.\n\n54:39.000 --> 54:41.000\nStraight up tuba.\n\n54:41.000 --> 54:43.000\nProper tuba.\n\n54:43.000 --> 54:45.000\nTuba snap.\n\n54:45.000 --> 54:48.000\nYeah, because then you're in and out.\n\n54:48.000 --> 54:49.000\nAre you?\n\n54:49.000 --> 54:52.000\nBecause how many songs have like a tuba solo?\n\n54:52.000 --> 54:54.000\nYou just show up and you're like,\n\n54:54.000 --> 54:55.000\njust be the best tuba player.\n\n54:55.000 --> 54:57.000\nTuba is like the bass player of the band.\n\n54:57.000 --> 55:00.000\nYeah, so we're talking in circles here.\n\n55:00.000 --> 55:02.000\nLike, I...\n\n55:02.000 --> 55:03.000\nYou want to be a bass player?\n\n55:03.000 --> 55:05.000\nThere's no lead singer in a symphony.\n\n55:05.000 --> 55:06.000\nThat's what I meant.\n\n55:06.000 --> 55:07.000\nThere's no superstar.\n\n55:07.000 --> 55:08.000\nYou answered my question.\n\n55:08.000 --> 55:13.000\nYou would like to play a kind of not up front instrument.\n\n55:13.000 --> 55:15.000\nIt's a specific flavor,\n\n55:15.000 --> 55:17.000\nbecause I would want to stand out.\n\n55:17.000 --> 55:20.000\nHope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope.\n\n55:20.000 --> 55:21.000\nOh shit, keep it going.\n\n55:21.000 --> 55:23.000\nThere's the tuba.\n\n55:23.000 --> 55:25.000\nBecause if you were like the best violinist in the world,\n\n55:25.000 --> 55:28.000\nthen your friend comes to see the concert and you get off stage\n\n55:28.000 --> 55:30.000\nand they're like,\n\n55:30.000 --> 55:31.000\ngood job.\n\n55:31.000 --> 55:33.000\nAnd you're like, how do you know you dick?\n\n55:33.000 --> 55:35.000\nYou could eat violinists up there.\n\n55:35.000 --> 55:38.000\nAll right, let's move on.\n\n55:38.000 --> 55:41.000\nUh, but I don't have a favorite color.\n\n55:41.000 --> 55:44.000\nAre you asshole?\n\n55:44.000 --> 55:46.000\nWhat are your top three? Top three?\n\n55:46.000 --> 55:49.000\nUh, orange?\n\n55:49.000 --> 55:50.000\nAll right.\n\n55:50.000 --> 55:51.000\nI love orange.\n\n55:51.000 --> 55:55.000\nBaby blue.\n\n55:55.000 --> 55:56.000\nHiroshima.\n\n55:56.000 --> 56:01.000\nAnd AIDS yellow.\n\n56:01.000 --> 56:05.000\nJust fuck the queen.\n\n56:05.000 --> 56:07.000\nDo you think I was just going to pander?\n\n56:07.000 --> 56:09.000\nAIDS yellow.\n\n56:09.000 --> 56:15.000\nThe color of AIDS.\n\n56:15.000 --> 56:16.000\nI went to Home Depot recently.\n\n56:16.000 --> 56:20.000\nIt's hard to get a good AIDS yellow.\n\n56:20.000 --> 56:22.000\nJaundice AIDS.\n\n56:22.000 --> 56:26.000\nThe color of your AIDS.\n\n56:26.000 --> 56:27.000\nUh, statistically speaking,\n\n56:27.000 --> 56:28.000\nanyone with AIDS here tonight?\n\n56:28.000 --> 56:30.000\nOf course, of course.\n\n56:30.000 --> 56:31.000\nYes.\n\n56:31.000 --> 56:33.000\nUh, too soon.\n\n56:33.000 --> 56:35.000\nBanana guy.\n\n56:35.000 --> 56:38.000\nThe, uh...\n\n56:38.000 --> 56:41.000\nHis banana is AIDS yellow.\n\n56:41.000 --> 56:45.000\nUh...\n\n56:45.000 --> 56:50.000\nBanana guy's got AIDS.\n\n56:50.000 --> 56:52.000\nVictor, do you have AIDS?\n\n56:52.000 --> 56:53.000\nNo, okay.\n\n56:53.000 --> 56:55.000\nHe's clear. He's good.\n\n56:55.000 --> 56:56.000\nAll right.\n\n56:56.000 --> 56:59.000\nSo one of the things I like to do when I come to Comic-Con\n\n56:59.000 --> 57:03.000\nis hang out with my very, very, very old friend.\n\n57:03.000 --> 57:05.000\nAs old as the hills.\n\n57:05.000 --> 57:08.000\nWho's always here with a little flower on his head,\n\n57:08.000 --> 57:10.000\nselling his little, his little trade paperbacks\n\n57:10.000 --> 57:12.000\nfrom his Canadian cartoon, Bob the Angry Flower.\n\n57:12.000 --> 57:14.000\nAre you talking about one of my favorite people in the world?\n\n57:14.000 --> 57:15.000\nYeah.\n\n57:15.000 --> 57:16.000\nSteven Knottley is here.\n\n57:16.000 --> 57:18.000\nSteven Knottley, Bob the Angry Flower.\n\n57:18.000 --> 57:19.000\nAre you going to come up, Steve?\n\n57:19.000 --> 57:23.000\nYou don't have to.\n\n57:23.000 --> 57:24.000\nI love this guy.\n\n57:24.000 --> 57:41.000\nHello, Steven. How are you, man?\n\n57:41.000 --> 57:42.000\nI'm okay here.\n\n57:42.000 --> 57:44.000\nI thought you were kidding when you said you were going to do this.\n\n57:44.000 --> 57:45.000\nDo what?\n\n57:45.000 --> 57:46.000\nYou didn't say it.\n\n57:46.000 --> 57:48.000\nI thought you were kidding.\n\n57:48.000 --> 57:49.000\nAll right.\n\n57:49.000 --> 57:50.000\nHolding it.\n\n57:50.000 --> 57:51.000\nIf you don't know Steven Knottley,\n\n57:51.000 --> 57:55.000\nhe writes a hilarious and poignant and trenchant little comic strip\n\n57:55.000 --> 57:56.000\nand ink and paper.\n\n57:56.000 --> 57:58.000\nI use two of those words when I'm pitching.\n\n57:58.000 --> 57:59.000\nIs that right?\n\n57:59.000 --> 58:00.000\nI don't say poignant.\n\n58:00.000 --> 58:01.000\nBut trenchant.\n\n58:01.000 --> 58:02.000\nYes.\n\n58:02.000 --> 58:03.000\nMaybe salient.\n\n58:03.000 --> 58:04.000\nI do say salient.\n\n58:04.000 --> 58:06.000\nIt's called Bob the Angry Flower,\n\n58:06.000 --> 58:08.000\nand it's great commentary.\n\n58:08.000 --> 58:10.000\nIt's quite wonderfully drawn.\n\n58:10.000 --> 58:14.000\nAnd it expresses all of your impotent rage\n\n58:14.000 --> 58:16.000\nand righteous indignation.\n\n58:16.000 --> 58:17.000\nThat's very cool.\n\n58:17.000 --> 58:18.000\nYeah.\n\n58:18.000 --> 58:20.000\nYou're one of my oldest and nerdiest friends.\n\n58:20.000 --> 58:23.000\nIf you combine the old and the nerdy,\n\n58:23.000 --> 58:25.000\nyou're definitely into one scale.\n\n58:25.000 --> 58:27.000\nThat's definitely your top of the list.\n\n58:27.000 --> 58:30.000\nIf you sort by nerdy and oldy.\n\n58:30.000 --> 58:33.000\nDo you remember when you were sitting in my one bedroom apartment\n\n58:33.000 --> 58:34.000\nwhile I was writing Monster House,\n\n58:34.000 --> 58:36.000\nand for some reason I had cocaine,\n\n58:36.000 --> 58:38.000\nand we were trying cocaine.\n\n58:38.000 --> 58:40.000\nI was writing Monster House.\n\n58:40.000 --> 58:41.000\nI do.\n\n58:41.000 --> 58:42.000\nI remember that.\n\n58:42.000 --> 58:47.000\nIt had the tenor of a proto-Harmontown encounter\n\n58:47.000 --> 58:50.000\nwhere I was like, we don't really do cocaine here,\n\n58:50.000 --> 58:54.000\nbut let's just do this anyway because I have some.\n\n58:54.000 --> 58:55.000\nI just had some.\n\n58:55.000 --> 58:56.000\nBecause when I moved to LA,\n\n58:56.000 --> 58:59.000\nI found out you could just call someone and have it delivered.\n\n58:59.000 --> 59:00.000\nA choir of cocaine.\n\n59:00.000 --> 59:02.000\nAnd that wasn't the gaze of Milwaukee.\n\n59:02.000 --> 59:04.000\nSo I was like, okay, I'll take some of that too.\n\n59:04.000 --> 59:05.000\nIt's like cinnamon sticks.\n\n59:05.000 --> 59:06.000\nYeah.\n\n59:06.000 --> 59:09.000\nAnd then it turns out cocaine is kind of a lot of fun.\n\n59:09.000 --> 59:12.000\nWe got a lot of talking done about technology and stuff.\n\n59:12.000 --> 59:16.000\nAnd then you spend a lot of time doing stuff like this.\n\n59:16.000 --> 59:17.000\nLike very excitedly.\n\n59:17.000 --> 59:18.000\nYeah.\n\n59:18.000 --> 59:19.000\nAnd then I tried to write Monster House,\n\n59:19.000 --> 59:21.000\nand I was like, the house is a monster.\n\n59:21.000 --> 59:24.000\nAnd then that's why the third act is just like,\n\n59:24.000 --> 59:27.000\nlet me find some dynamite.\n\n59:27.000 --> 59:34.000\nBut I remember way back then you blew my mind with this concept.\n\n59:34.000 --> 59:43.000\nYou introduced me to it, which is the idea that intelligence is a field\n\n59:43.000 --> 59:47.000\nthat is the actual thing that is alive in the universe.\n\n59:47.000 --> 59:51.000\nAnd that DNA life itself is sort of a subset of that.\n\n59:51.000 --> 59:54.000\nBecause there's an intelligence to the universe.\n\n59:54.000 --> 59:59.000\nNot intelligent design.\n\n59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000\nThat information.\n\n01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.000\nLet's say information, not intelligence.\n\n01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:06.000\nAnybody have any coke?\n\n01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:12.000\nThat the idea is that genetically reproduced life is sort of the pawn in the game.\n\n01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:17.000\nThe reason why there's living things on Earth,\n\n01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:23.000\neating each other, and evolving based on which person or thing it's eating,\n\n01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:28.000\nis because overall there's just this drive by this field\n\n01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:31.000\nthat wants to continue to store more and more information.\n\n01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.000\nIt's not even a field.\n\n01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:36.000\nI was sort of summarizing stuff that a guy named Robert Wright has written about.\n\n01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:40.000\nHe's got a book called Non-Zero that he talks about this in great depth,\n\n01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:45.000\nwhich is basically like there's zero-sum encounters.\n\n01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:49.000\nIf you're playing tennis, if you win, then I lose. Zero-sum.\n\n01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:54.000\nBut there are encounters in which there are non-zero-sum that both can win.\n\n01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:58.000\nAnd basically entropy is the bad side of it,\n\n01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000\nbut the good side is you put energy in,\n\n01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:04.000\nyou can have things that both sides get more out of it.\n\n01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000\nThere's an entropy cost.\n\n01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:11.000\nBut basically things become more complicated and glommed together,\n\n01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:14.000\nand then those things become more complicated and glommed together.\n\n01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:19.000\nAnd that just happens, whether you're a quark, or an atom, or a molecule,\n\n01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:24.000\nor a lobo, or a zip-head, or a lobo, or a dead pool, or a trank,\n\n01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:30.000\nor a worm, or a person, or a corporation, or a human being,\n\n01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:35.000\nor a robo-galactic mega-brain, or a flower.\n\n01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:40.000\nSo the idea being that, as far as our position in this whole thing,\n\n01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:45.000\nis that we are the pinnacle of genetic information evolution.\n\n01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:51.000\nWe have chromosomes jammed into the cells of our body\n\n01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:57.000\nthat are so coiled up and so stuffed into each cell's nucleus\n\n01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:04.000\nthat the operation of them splitting takes this enormously complicated process\n\n01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:09.000\nbecause it's just spools and spools and spools of molecular information.\n\n01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:14.000\nBut the sum total of that is that we're these monkeys that have these brains,\n\n01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:20.000\nand we're building these computers, and we're creating new ways to store information.\n\n01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:23.000\nAnd we seem to be doing it compulsively.\n\n01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:28.000\nNot all of those things make us better monkeys.\n\n01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:35.000\nWe seem compelled to keep advancing our way of storing and transferring information,\n\n01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:40.000\nsometimes directly in spite of what actually profits us as primates.\n\n01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:45.000\nAnd so it's almost as if we're being compelled by some horrible larger...\n\n01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:49.000\nNo, maybe not horrible, maybe wonderful, but certainly not a thing that's rooting for us.\n\n01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:52.000\nSomething that's kind of like using us as a little slipper\n\n01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:55.000\nthat it's going to get tired of and step out of and move on from.\n\n01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:59.000\nWell, the way I would look at it is like, if you look at yourself,\n\n01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:03.000\nyou consider yourself to be a singular entity, right?\n\n01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000\nYou are Dan Harmon.\n\n01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:12.000\nBut at the same time, you are a corporation made up of trillions and trillions of cells that make up Dan Harmon.\n\n01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000\nThank you.\n\n01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:18.000\nAnd those cells are individual living beings.\n\n01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:27.000\nAnd there is a long history of those cells learning how to make up a corporation\n\n01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:32.000\nof tens of trillions of trillions of cells that can actually work as a gigantic corporation,\n\n01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:38.000\nall doing their little jobs, to be this thing that, on the level of a cell,\n\n01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:42.000\nyou could not imagine cells don't picture that the thing that they make up is conscious\n\n01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000\nin the way that they know.\n\n01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:49.000\nYou know, if they're just like, well, here I am, a capillary cell, and I've got my buddies here.\n\n01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:53.000\nWe're all sort of pasted together, and we see all the dudes go by and blah, blah, blah.\n\n01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:59.000\nDo you ever think about God? Do you ever think about there's a guy named Dan that we're all a part of?\n\n01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:05.000\nAnd it's like, shut up and do your job, man. Like, process that oxygen.\n\n01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000\nBut you are that entity.\n\n01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:08.000\nRight.\n\n01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:11.000\nAnd now we also make up other entities.\n\n01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:14.000\nWe are parts of corporations. We're parts of nations.\n\n01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:19.000\nWe do not think that the thing United States has an identity,\n\n01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:24.000\na sense of self in the way that we ourselves think that we have that.\n\n01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000\nBut why do we think that?\n\n01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:32.000\nIt's completely arbitrary that we, only we, this collection, this assemblage of matter and life,\n\n01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:39.000\nhave the capacity to have an identity, and none others do.\n\n01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:44.000\nI mean, what would this, what would the macro picture look like if we were all,\n\n01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:47.000\nwould it end at the outskirts of the Earth?\n\n01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:52.000\nAre we just stuck on this blue marble and like connecting with each other\n\n01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:57.000\nand trying to form a multicellular organism on the planet that will then reproduce?\n\n01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:58.000\nI hope so.\n\n01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:01.000\nOr is it more sinister than that?\n\n01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:05.000\nI hope so, and it is more sinister than that.\n\n01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:10.000\nMaybe there's another planet like many light years away that's having the same experience happen to it\n\n01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:16.000\nand the actual overriding principle is that we're supposed to combine with that\n\n01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:20.000\nand we have absolutely no say in where this goes.\n\n01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:21.000\nWho cares though, right?\n\n01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000\nI mean, I guess, well, no, we all care.\n\n01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:24.000\nEverybody's got a stake in it.\n\n01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:30.000\nNot only every human being, but everything in the universe has a stake in its own existence.\n\n01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:35.000\nLike 5 million, 10 million years ago, there was no such thing as human beings.\n\n01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:39.000\n50 million years from now, they will look back and go,\n\n01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:46.000\noh, that's right, there's no such thing as some kind of Borg-like entity\n\n01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:50.000\nthat covers light years of space and time.\n\n01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:53.000\nHow much time do you think we have as humans?\n\n01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:58.000\nI'm going to defer to Dan on that one.\n\n01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:02.000\nStephen, the joke with Dan and I when we meet Stephen is always,\n\n01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000\nwhat's currently your biggest concern?\n\n01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000\nAnd you, it's like super volcanoes.\n\n01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000\nOh, that's so old.\n\n01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000\nWhat right now is your main?\n\n01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000\nPlastic bottles.\n\n01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:13.000\nPlastic bottles.\n\n01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:14.000\nThat's the main thing?\n\n01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:15.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000\nI'm just terrified now.\n\n01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:20.000\nMy biggest fear now, have you ever watched that Doomsday Preppers show?\n\n01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:23.000\nYou're more worried about plastic bottles than super volcanoes?\n\n01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:24.000\nYes.\n\n01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:27.000\nPlastic bottles are pretty immediate, I would say.\n\n01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000\nDid you think they're immediate?\n\n01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:35.000\nI hear that Tom Selleck was stealing water to water his avocado orchards.\n\n01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000\nStealing it from who?\n\n01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:40.000\nFrom the city, no, the county of Ventura.\n\n01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000\nThat's where I hail from.\n\n01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000\nHe stole water?\n\n01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:48.000\nYeah, he hired people to collect water and then they brought it to his...\n\n01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:49.000\nI read about that.\n\n01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:50.000\nThat's some fucked up shit, man.\n\n01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:53.000\nI'd imagine they're watering his mustache though, you know.\n\n01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:56.000\nDoes he sell avocados or does he just...\n\n01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000\nHe eats an orchard or a farm or something.\n\n01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000\nHe loves guacamole.\n\n01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000\nHe has these parties where he's like...\n\n01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:08.000\nIf you haven't had Tom Selleck's guacamole, you have not had guacamole.\n\n01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:15.000\nI'll tell you, my big panic is not water bottles, although it sounds like I need to learn more about the immediacy of that.\n\n01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:21.000\nMy new thing is, it's just economic collapse.\n\n01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:31.000\nIt's just the idea that everything is based on this fake idea that something's worth something compared to something else,\n\n01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:39.000\nand that if the American dollar was worth a dollar on Monday and then was worth 70 cents on Tuesday,\n\n01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:45.000\nthe six hours from then, there would be fires on the horizon like Blade Runner,\n\n01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:51.000\nand six hours from that, cops would stop showing up for work because they'd be like, it's just on fire.\n\n01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:56.000\nAnd I'm going to go home and protect my family with my gun from work.\n\n01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:03.000\nAnd before I worry about something as cool as a super volcano, I actually...\n\n01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:04.000\nWhich is very cool.\n\n01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:07.000\nThe cool thing to worry about, everybody, read about super volcanoes,\n\n01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:11.000\nbecause I don't want to diss your concern about super volcanoes.\n\n01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:14.000\nThey are a great way for humanity to be exterminated.\n\n01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000\nThe first one to lay this out, you were very...\n\n01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:21.000\nAbout five years ago, you were very concerned about the super volcano under your somebody.\n\n01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000\nAnd now, not so much.\n\n01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000\nYeah, I...\n\n01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:28.000\nBut I would agree with you, the economic problem is...\n\n01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:37.000\nI want to build a big bomb shelter underground and just have water and shotguns and dogs.\n\n01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:44.000\nJust water and dogs, then everything else will be okay.\n\n01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:48.000\nYeah, because I think you can milk dogs and live off of them.\n\n01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000\nAnd feed the water.\n\n01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000\nI'll have mice for the dogs to eat.\n\n01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:56.000\nI think if you could milk dogs, we would already have done that.\n\n01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:00.000\nIf you could get a dog to milk another dog, we would have done that.\n\n01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000\nBut if you teach them to fish...\n\n01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:05.000\nWe really fucked dogs up. We fucked dogs up.\n\n01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:10.000\nIn other words, we're close to the ideal and idealized economic metaphor.\n\n01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:16.000\nWe're starting out as like, we live in a desert island and you get two coconuts and I catch one fish and we'll...\n\n01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000\nYeah, we're all fucked up.\n\n01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:22.000\nBut now that we've moved into dog water milking systems...\n\n01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:31.000\nWhen you see a schnauzer, that's a regular dog whose limbs have been bred to be little flippers.\n\n01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:35.000\nBut I do want to refer to what you were saying.\n\n01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:40.000\nThe economic concern, which I would summarize as going, the problem being that even though everybody here...\n\n01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:43.000\nWe're all capitalists, right? Capitalism, yeah?\n\n01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000\nYeah.\n\n01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000\nCapitalism.\n\n01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:50.000\nOh boo, also correct.\n\n01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:53.000\nAlmost the same now because...\n\n01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:57.000\nAny anarcho-cynicalists out there.\n\n01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:01.000\nBut even the people who self-identify as capitalism...\n\n01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:07.000\nWhat is capitalism? Is the understanding that capital plus labor equals wealth?\n\n01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:08.000\nNo.\n\n01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:11.000\nWell, no, it is. That's capital.\n\n01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:16.000\nWorkers create wealth. Wealth is accumulated, that becomes capital.\n\n01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:20.000\nLand is capital. If I own a piece of land, that's capital.\n\n01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:23.000\nBut I can't make it productive without workers.\n\n01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:27.000\nWorkers create wealth, but capitalists own all the wealth.\n\n01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000\nExactly.\n\n01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:35.000\nWait, I don't want to miss this point. I'm too stupid. Take me through this, like a children's book.\n\n01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:40.000\nCapital is the unpaid portion of labor.\n\n01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:44.000\nIf surplus is the unpaid portion...\n\n01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:47.000\nIf everybody got paid for what their work was actually...\n\n01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:48.000\nThere would be no profit.\n\n01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:49.000\nThere would be no capital.\n\n01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:55.000\nIt's the part that you don't pay your laborers. To the extent that we don't pay our workers, that's capital.\n\n01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:59.000\nThat's profit. I own something. I have property rights. I own it.\n\n01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:04.000\nNow my ownership of it does not allow it to become productive. I apply labor to it.\n\n01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:07.000\nI pay the laborers something less than I sell it for.\n\n01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:13.000\nThe gap is my profit, which then I feed back into my additional capital.\n\n01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:19.000\nI become richer and richer, but then I also push forward the story, which is that, basically,\n\n01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:28.000\nmoney and wealth is a function of owning and being rich, rather than no money is created by people who work.\n\n01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:32.000\nIt's just that simple. Yet you don't really quite hear people go like,\n\n01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:38.000\noh, well, all these rich people... You don't want to take their value or their wealth.\n\n01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:43.000\nIt's like, well, it is their wealth because they own the means of production,\n\n01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:48.000\nbut it's not like they made it. The people who made it made it.\n\n01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:58.000\nI think we can make this a little clearer for the common man, even though I understand it,\n\n01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:09.000\nif I do it as a rap.\n\n01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:20.000\nYeah, yeah, yeah, capitalism. Yeah, it's forming a schism between the rich and the poor.\n\n01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:31.000\nIt's like jism. Starting over. Yo, I fucked your mama. I fucked your mama.\n\n01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:38.000\nI fucked your mama so hard it hurt. I fucked your mama like my name was John Hurt.\n\n01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:48.000\nIt's the same word. Sorry. Starting over. Yo, yo.\n\n01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:55.000\nA dollar's worth this. A dollar's worth that. I fucked your mama until she was blind as a bat.\n\n01:12:55.000 --> 01:13:03.000\nFlying around using sonar. I fucked your mama. I got a bonar. I put it inside her.\n\n01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:10.000\nShe was like, that's quieter. Starting over. Starting over.\n\n01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:17.000\nOh, you were doing a surplus value. Yo, what's up with that shirt?\n\n01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:22.000\nYo, are you going to work? Yo, what's up with your hair?\n\n01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:29.000\nYo, don't take the stairs. Starting over. Didn't work in the crowd. Didn't work either.\n\n01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000\nYo, yo.\n\n01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:34.000\nJazz, jazz, jazz, jazz, capital.\n\n01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000\nRap, rap, rapity, rap.\n\n01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:37.000\nRapitalism.\n\n01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:42.000\nI'm going to have a rap attack. I'm going to rap good. I'm going to rap good.\n\n01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:50.000\nI'm going to rap good and I'm rapping real good. Just starting over. Starting over.\n\n01:13:50.000 --> 01:14:02.000\nThere are seven wonders of the world. This rapping is about to be worth it.\n\n01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:07.000\nYo, I went out to the street. I needed some bread and I got some meat.\n\n01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:13.000\nIt was on a protein diet, so I had the latter. I fucked your mama like she was pancake batter.\n\n01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:20.000\nI poured her pussy into a pan. I fucked her as hard as I can, but it wasn't hard enough,\n\n01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:26.000\nso I got a new job sucking your dad's knob.\n\n01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:30.000\nI love your dad now. I love your dad now.\n\n01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:31.000\nProgressive.\n\n01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000\nI love your dad now.\n\n01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:34.000\nProgressive.\n\n01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:39.000\nI love your dad now. Your dad made love to me.\n\n01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:42.000\nI fucked him so hard that I broke my knee.\n\n01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:47.000\nDon't fucking try to stop me. Try to shut me down.\n\n01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:51.000\nNo, no. Just getting on a roll.\n\n01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:54.000\nYo, yo, yo.\n\n01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:57.000\nI met your dad in the fall of 72.\n\n01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:00.000\nI fucked him so hard I lost one of my shoes.\n\n01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:12.000\nWhere did it go?\n\n01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:15.000\nThere's a guy that's mad at the back now.\n\n01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:23.000\nAlright. 9-11.\n\n01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:27.000\nAlright, that didn't work. You can't force it.\n\n01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:32.000\nI think we've learned a lot about the nature of capitalism.\n\n01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:36.000\nI hope so. I think, you know, there's 500 people here.\n\n01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:54.000\nEven if you force it.\n\n01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:59.000\nThose of you who are only listening, Dan was presented by a hilarious gentleman\n\n01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:03.000\nwith a Bloody Mary with everything on top of it.\n\n01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:06.000\nA BLT's on it?\n\n01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:10.000\nDid the people at Tin Roof make this or was this assembled by...\n\n01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:11.000\nI don't know. Also, I wouldn't drink it.\n\n01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:14.000\nI think it was phoned in from Alaska.\n\n01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:18.000\nNikki and Nicole made this out of the...\n\n01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000\nThank you.\n\n01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000\nNikki and Nicole.\n\n01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000\nAlright, so do they work here?\n\n01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000\nMay I get a Fernette Bronco, by the chance?\n\n01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000\nHave you got a Fernette Bronco back there?\n\n01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:31.000\nUpstairs? What's her name upstairs?\n\n01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000\nUpstairs. Can I get a Fernette Bronco?\n\n01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:36.000\nCan we make a human chain and get me a Fernette Bronco?\n\n01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000\nSo you're still on the Fernette?\n\n01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:43.000\nI wondered if you'd moved on from there.\n\n01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:46.000\nMotherfucker. Cheeseburger. How is it?\n\n01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:51.000\nThis is the best Bloody Mary I've ever had in my life.\n\n01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:56.000\nLet's bring my soulmate up, Erin McGathy.\n\n01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000\nYou want to do a rap?\n\n01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000\nRap it, rap it.\n\n01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:15.000\nRap it out, rap it out.\n\n01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000\nYours backstage for a long time.\n\n01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:21.000\nWaiting for a rock.\n\n01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000\nYeah, keep rapping.\n\n01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:26.000\nBrassist Park. Don't know if the bit went well.\n\n01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:30.000\nWas unceremoniously excused, but I can't walk in these shoes.\n\n01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:34.000\nWelcome to McGathey Tech.\n\n01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000\nThis is McGathey Tech.\n\n01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:40.000\nMy favorite color is red-orange.\n\n01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:43.000\nA favorite color just sounds like having a favorite movie.\n\n01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000\nYou just see it and you like it.\n\n01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:48.000\nWhen you see a favorite movie and you have a favorite movie,\n\n01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000\nit doesn't mean you want to live in it.\n\n01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:53.000\nYou just like it more than the other movies.\n\n01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000\nIt's like having a favorite anything.\n\n01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:56.000\nYeah, but...\n\n01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000\nColors.\n\n01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000\nColors.\n\n01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:05.000\nWhite is all the colors together.\n\n01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000\nYes.\n\n01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000\nYeah.\n\n01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000\nBut...\n\n01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:18.000\nIs Citizen Kane better or worse than Star Wars?\n\n01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:21.000\nAnd that's like, oh, what's my favorite movie?\n\n01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000\nWell, okay, come on, you're racing.\n\n01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:24.000\nYou're racing.\n\n01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:27.000\nYou have favorite movies all the time and you have a favorite movie, too.\n\n01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:35.000\nThat was Luke Skywalker losing his sled.\n\n01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:42.000\nWe hadn't planned the end of that bit or any of that bit.\n\n01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:46.000\nI'll tell you, there are a few things that are then walking off the stage\n\n01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:50.000\nin these shoes down that thing.\n\n01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000\nWhy is that sad?\n\n01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000\nBecause I can't walk in these shoes.\n\n01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:58.000\nThese are these crazy heels from that movie.\n\n01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:02.000\nAnd also no woman ever wants to be sent to her paddock.\n\n01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:08.000\nEven if she owns the paddocks, even if she drives, there are hers.\n\n01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:09.000\nYes.\n\n01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000\nAll right, so how's it going?\n\n01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000\nAny complaints?\n\n01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000\nI rapped about the color thing.\n\n01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:22.000\nBut seriously, you have a favorite color?\n\n01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:23.000\nYes, red orange.\n\n01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000\nRed orange.\n\n01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000\nCan't even pick.\n\n01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:30.000\nNot red and orange, but like a red orange.\n\n01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:33.000\nOkay, my favorite is blue, yellow, green.\n\n01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:36.000\nI guess I'm better at it.\n\n01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000\nSo that's like a teal.\n\n01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:39.000\nOkay.\n\n01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:42.000\nIt's more like double green, isn't it?\n\n01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000\nWhat's your favorite color, Spencer?\n\n01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000\nIt's extra green.\n\n01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000\nYeah, just extra green.\n\n01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000\nMy favorite color is green.\n\n01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:53.000\nIt's a good color.\n\n01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000\nIt's a funny thing to be mad about.\n\n01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000\nI think you should let people do their own thing.\n\n01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000\nI'm not telling them to do anything.\n\n01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:02.000\nYou're telling them to die because they like colors.\n\n01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:05.000\nI announced that I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore.\n\n01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:09.000\nAnd they fucking, they rose up and they were like, finally, someone says it.\n\n01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000\nWho has a favorite color?\n\n01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:14.000\nThey were like, finally, finally, the fucking.\n\n01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:21.000\nSo here has a, who likes, who likes a color?\n\n01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:22.000\nThank you.\n\n01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:25.000\nWho has a favorite one?\n\n01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:26.000\nAll right.\n\n01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:27.000\nWell, let's go.\n\n01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:30.000\nI'm going to, I wish we had a wireless mic because I just want to like,\n\n01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:34.000\nI just want to run through and get everyone's favorite color.\n\n01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:37.000\nWhy would you stop people from that?\n\n01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:38.000\nI don't want to.\n\n01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:39.000\nI want to, I want to celebrate it.\n\n01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000\nYou have lost, you have lost a cord there.\n\n01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:42.000\nI think you can probably roam.\n\n01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000\nI don't think I can make it out there.\n\n01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:45.000\nCheck it out.\n\n01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000\nYou have lots of cable there in front of you.\n\n01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:48.000\nOh.\n\n01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:52.000\nYou're the one person I'm not going to ask.\n\n01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:55.000\nNow, Dan, you came down pretty hard on Bloody Mary.\n\n01:20:55.000 --> 01:21:02.000\nNavy blue is the Tim Allen of colors.\n\n01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:03.000\nShit.\n\n01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:04.000\nHarvard's full of protein.\n\n01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:07.000\nNow he's going to fucking come right after you.\n\n01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:08.000\nDon't die, Dan.\n\n01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:09.000\nWhere's the hamlet?\n\n01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:10.000\nAre you choking?\n\n01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:17.000\nI just inhaled a piece of burger.\n\n01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:18.000\nI'm fine.\n\n01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:23.000\nYou know how when you, just a fleck of food goes into your lungs?\n\n01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:24.000\nIt's not going to kill me.\n\n01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:31.000\nIt's just going to bum me out for the next hour.\n\n01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:32.000\nSee what?\n\n01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:35.000\nThey said you're great.\n\n01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:38.000\nDavis and Gray, what?\n\n01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000\nThat's a good color.\n\n01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000\nThat's the Navy blue guy.\n\n01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:48.000\nWhy don't we do a rainbow prism from red to purple?\n\n01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:52.000\nAnd you applaud for your favorite color.\n\n01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000\nThat's just the Navy blue guy.\n\n01:21:54.000 --> 01:22:00.000\nHis favorite color is pandering.\n\n01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:04.000\nHe's a fucking schmoo.\n\n01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:09.000\nTake over the show, I'm going to die.\n\n01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000\nYou flew too close to the sun, Nicarus.\n\n01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:14.000\nI inhaled a piece of...\n\n01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:19.000\nThe color wheel is horseshit because it's not a wheel.\n\n01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:22.000\nIt starts at ultraviolet and goes to infrared.\n\n01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:25.000\nWe just curl it up because we can't see anymore.\n\n01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:30.000\nOh shit.\n\n01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:33.000\nScience snap.\n\n01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:34.000\nYou're all perceptive.\n\n01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000\nYou have to take over the show.\n\n01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000\nI'm going to die.\n\n01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000\nThe guy who's telling you colors are bad\n\n01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000\ncan't swallow properly.\n\n01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000\nWhich is something that babies can do.\n\n01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000\nAlso, you came out, you opened with\n\n01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000\nyou hate buddy marriage with food in it.\n\n01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000\nNow it's going to kill you.\n\n01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:53.000\nI like the food pipe.\n\n01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000\nI explained something to you.\n\n01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000\nHere's why you don't want food to drink.\n\n01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000\nYou tried to drink your food.\n\n01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:00.000\nYou can't drink food.\n\n01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:03.000\nYou can't drink over 40 years.\n\n01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:04.000\nHere we go.\n\n01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000\nStarting at the top of the rainbow.\n\n01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000\nRed.\n\n01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000\nOrange.\n\n01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000\nYellow.\n\n01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000\nGreen.\n\n01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000\nBlue.\n\n01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:19.000\nBlue.\n\n01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000\nPurple.\n\n01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000\nInteresting.\n\n01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:24.000\nSmart crowd, right?\n\n01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000\nBecause smart people are...\n\n01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000\nBlack.\n\n01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000\nThis guy in the front row.\n\n01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000\nI like Seafoam green once in a while.\n\n01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000\nI like a nice Seafoam.\n\n01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000\nThese MC John shirts are all in Seafoam green.\n\n01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000\nMinty 90s color.\n\n01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000\nBlack is the absolute ball color.\n\n01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000\nWe're doing a different scale.\n\n01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000\nWho loves black?\n\n01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000\nJeff Davis suit gray.\n\n01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000\nWhite.\n\n01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000\nYeah.\n\n01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000\nWho hates all colors?\n\n01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000\nMonochrome.\n\n01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000\nGrayscale.\n\n01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000\nGrayscale.\n\n01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000\nI'm just warning you guys.\n\n01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000\nYou kids.\n\n01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000\nYou're esophageal flap.\n\n01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000\nYou know how your toilet...\n\n01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000\nSome of you guys have apartments.\n\n01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000\nHave you had to fix your toilet?\n\n01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000\nBecause there's a little flap that makes it sealed.\n\n01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000\nAnd then the tank can fill up with water.\n\n01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000\nYou know how it rots away?\n\n01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000\nAnd you have to replace it.\n\n01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000\n42.\n\n01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000\nVodka.\n\n01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000\nIt doesn't seal all the way.\n\n01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000\nSo, I'm just warning you.\n\n01:24:26.000

01:24:40.000\nYeah.\n\n01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000\nOh, my God.\n\n01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000\nWhat if that's how I had done?\n\n01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000\nOh, man.\n\n01:24:46.000 -->
