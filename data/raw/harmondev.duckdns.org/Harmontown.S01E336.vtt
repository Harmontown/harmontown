{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:22.000\nI love this theater. It's so cool to walk out. I wish you could all stand up here and look at how good Ruby this is. Thank you all for being here.\n\n00:22.000 --> 00:37.000\nFrom the heart of Los Angeles, MacArthur Park, where the icing is melting off the cake for no reason, Harmontown is now in session. Please welcome your Game Master, Spencer Crittenden.\n\n00:37.000 --> 00:53.000\nHello Spencer. Hey man. Is your mic good? I don't know. Yeah, you're there.\n\n00:53.000 --> 01:20.000\nLet's sing along. How's your mic? It's good. It's better than a mic should be. Keep going. I got it for free. There's free on the chairs over there. Let's bring out the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon. Yeah.\n\n01:23.000 --> 01:46.000\nThank you. Thank you, Dan. Yeah. It's a mic check song where we sing into our mics. What kind of booty does your mama like? She likes it long and wide. I heard she likes it inside.\n\n01:46.000 --> 02:01.000\nDamn, the poopiest rim. Lucky him.\n\n02:01.000 --> 02:22.000\nEveryone that your mama meets is a potential ill treat for her insatiable appetite for booty delight. Damn, I remember the time when your mama ate booty with a squeeze of lime.\n\n02:22.000 --> 02:46.000\nNot a lot that rhymes with time except for his squeeze of lime. It's a blime. I mean, yeah, I know there's other words. It's a grime. Oh, really? Damn.\n\n02:46.000 --> 03:04.000\nI remember going to your mama's house. I got D Laos afterwards by the fire department because her apartment is infested with scabies. Okay.\n\n03:04.000 --> 03:24.000\nOr rabies. Making babies. There's an Indian dessert called Jalebi's. All right. Welcome, everybody. Thank you for coming. We did it. We fucking did it again. You came here for entertainment and guess what? You got, you got.\n\n03:24.000 --> 03:34.000\nYou're already ahead. The show could be over right now. We could bring the curtain down. What is $10 kitschy anywhere else? Huh? Like a Snickers bar and maybe like a half an Avengers movie?\n\n03:34.000 --> 03:45.000\nThree quarters of a cracker. What are you going to watch the Hulk not turn into the Hulk, huh? Come on. Does the Hulk not turn into the Hulk? That's what I heard. I don't know. Spoilers. I haven't seen it.\n\n03:45.000 --> 04:01.000\nHow does he not be a Hulk? Jeff, do you notice anything different about me? A certain glow perhaps? Oh, you're pregnant. Close. You are looking at a man in escrow.\n\n04:01.000 --> 04:20.000\nYou're going to get birth to a house. You actually, you made the deal. You might get the house. Put an offer on a house that offer was accepted. Escrow was negotiated. I guess that's a thing, like the length of the escrow. You kind of negotiate that too.\n\n04:20.000 --> 04:34.000\nIt's not the length of the escrow that matters, Dan. It's the motion of the ocean. Yeah, so we agreed on it and I doc you signed a thing and we're off. I think I'll have a house in 30 days.\n\n04:34.000 --> 04:41.000\nWhat will make this new house better than your current house? It's giant. It's bigger.\n\n04:41.000 --> 04:59.000\nHow do you utilize that space? Are you going to just be running around or having... Well, Cody and I went through it the other day and we did realize that, because initially we had this plan, like Cody and I were going to go, okay, we're going to have a master bedroom,\n\n04:59.000 --> 05:16.000\nbut then we're going to each have our own bedroom, because we like the psychological health of, like, hey, if we're together, we choose to be together.\n\n05:16.000 --> 05:29.000\nCody still has her apartment and she's been sleeping at my place so regularly that you could almost call it living with me, but I think there's an important thing there for her, maybe for me too, where it's like, hey, you can't take this person for granted.\n\n05:29.000 --> 05:42.000\nThey got their own apartment. They don't need to be here. Getting in little squabbles and the repairing is maybe easier, thinking like, hey, no one's a hostage here.\n\n05:42.000 --> 05:48.000\nYeah, and so when you want to be romantic and connect, you can go back into the main sanctum.\n\n05:48.000 --> 05:57.000\nRight, and that I think is the more important thing is what it does. It's not about like, oh, let's prepare to be squabbling and then people are actually going to sleep in these other rooms.\n\n05:57.000 --> 06:12.000\nIt probably never happened, but psychologically what that transforms your master bedroom into, which is like, it's like a hotel suite. This is not a place for Dan to have his USB cables all over the place and stuff.\n\n06:12.000 --> 06:25.000\nSo when we were shopping for a house, we had a certain bedroom count, and it was kind of ridiculous because it included two bedrooms, a master bedroom, and then in addition to that, we want a guest room,\n\n06:25.000 --> 06:31.000\nand there's other shit that we want. And so I was like, God damn, you need that many bedrooms? Okay.\n\n06:31.000 --> 06:41.000\nAnd we found a place that has that many, but the master bedroom is so, it's got these gigantic walk-in closets. They're like his and hers walk-in closets.\n\n06:41.000 --> 06:49.000\nLike, you could put a bed in my closet. So I'm not going to put a bed in my closet, but at the same time, I feel like I could be such a pig in that closet.\n\n06:49.000 --> 06:55.000\nLike Cody says, as long as there are your shits behind that door, I'm never going to be like...\n\n06:55.000 --> 06:58.000\nWhat do you mean precisely? What would be pig-ish behind his closet door?\n\n06:58.000 --> 07:08.000\nMy half of my current bedroom... Cody's kind of a neat freak. My half of my current bedroom looks like a 10-year-old boy's bedroom.\n\n07:08.000 --> 07:20.000\nLike, I just drop clothes where I take them off so I can put them on tomorrow, and then I'll get an electronic thing from Amazon, and I'll open it up, and the boxes are all over the place,\n\n07:20.000 --> 07:28.000\nand there's cables running everywhere, and I got a USB hub where an alarm clock goes, and there's cords coming out.\n\n07:28.000 --> 07:37.000\nIs there a sexy scenario where, if you have the master bedroom, where that is the let's be together because we love each other and we're going to smooch,\n\n07:37.000 --> 07:41.000\nbut we also have our separate rooms where we're doing our own thing.\n\n07:41.000 --> 07:43.000\nWait, when the master...\n\n07:43.000 --> 07:45.000\nBut we're not going to do that anymore.\n\n07:45.000 --> 07:46.000\nNo.\n\n07:46.000 --> 07:51.000\nWe decided, we got these giant walking closets, like, we don't need...\n\n07:51.000 --> 07:57.000\nThe upshot of it is that we're walking around the house, and we're like, okay, so this is where the tavern's going to go.\n\n07:57.000 --> 07:58.000\nThis is where the...\n\n07:58.000 --> 07:59.000\nThe tavern?\n\n07:59.000 --> 08:01.000\nYeah, I got a tavern in my house now.\n\n08:01.000 --> 08:04.000\nOkay, so you're going to recreate another tavern where you have a...\n\n08:04.000 --> 08:08.000\nYou lose shit by moving, like, I got a tavern and I got a theater.\n\n08:08.000 --> 08:10.000\nI mean, you have a place to...\n\n08:10.000 --> 08:12.000\nIt's not a real theater, you don't have to freak out.\n\n08:14.000 --> 08:17.000\nOr sneeze or whatever you did.\n\n08:17.000 --> 08:19.000\nHe didn't freak out, he just went...\n\n08:21.000 --> 08:24.000\nHe sneezed or something, he's got a luxury allergy, I get it.\n\n08:24.000 --> 08:29.000\nI had a hard time, my immune system started to shut down too when I realized how fucking rich I was.\n\n08:29.000 --> 08:31.000\nSo now, you're going to have...\n\n08:31.000 --> 08:37.000\nNow you're going to have one master bedroom and not two separate sanctums.\n\n08:37.000 --> 08:39.000\nIt'll be one main sanctum.\n\n08:39.000 --> 08:44.000\nAnd is Cody or you going to have the other bedroom when you guys are not, like...\n\n08:44.000 --> 08:46.000\nWe each get...\n\n08:46.000 --> 08:53.000\nCody and I each have two bedrooms to choose from.\n\n08:53.000 --> 08:54.000\nTo play with.\n\n08:54.000 --> 08:55.000\nRight.\n\n08:55.000 --> 09:01.000\nSo we could make one of those... I could make one in my bedroom, I could put a bed in it.\n\n09:01.000 --> 09:02.000\nI'm not going to do that.\n\n09:02.000 --> 09:05.000\nI'm going to put a green screen in it or something.\n\n09:05.000 --> 09:07.000\nI'm going to put a sound booth in there.\n\n09:07.000 --> 09:11.000\nI'm going to be like, she seems to have an invisible touch.\n\n09:13.000 --> 09:15.000\nI'm going to make a panic room.\n\n09:16.000 --> 09:19.000\nI just panicked when you wanted to fill Collins' rooms.\n\n09:20.000 --> 09:22.000\nHere's the thing I'm really going to do.\n\n09:22.000 --> 09:29.000\nThere's this rather large closet that doesn't necessarily...\n\n09:29.000 --> 09:33.000\nThe layout of the house doesn't indicate that there should be anything there.\n\n09:34.000 --> 09:36.000\nThere was this one house we saw.\n\n09:36.000 --> 09:40.000\nIt was a really nice house hunting adventure because we looked at some places where I was like,\n\n09:40.000 --> 09:42.000\nthis place is fucking rad.\n\n09:43.000 --> 09:48.000\nAnd then you got to think, does rad mean you want to live here?\n\n09:48.000 --> 09:54.000\nIt's hard to... You're looking at a house and you're like, I always picture myself in these places\n\n09:54.000 --> 09:56.000\nand that it's always ironic.\n\n09:56.000 --> 09:58.000\nAnd then I'm like, do the ironic thing.\n\n09:59.000 --> 10:01.000\nLive for your biopic.\n\n10:02.000 --> 10:07.000\nHave this third act begin and it says 10 years later and it's like,\n\n10:07.000 --> 10:10.000\nfade in on some shit that makes your mom sick.\n\n10:12.000 --> 10:15.000\nIt just makes people shake their head in Wisconsin and go,\n\n10:15.000 --> 10:20.000\ngod damn, this motherfucker lives in a giant concrete block with fucking nude sculptures\n\n10:20.000 --> 10:24.000\noverlooking a fucking Malibu infinity pool\n\n10:24.000 --> 10:28.000\nand he's a fucking barbecue shaped like a pretzel\n\n10:28.000 --> 10:31.000\nbecause Tim Burton designed it or something.\n\n10:32.000 --> 10:37.000\nI looked at a place that had a turntable garage.\n\n10:39.000 --> 10:44.000\nYou just put your Prius on there and just fucking rotisserie it for your Coke parties\n\n10:44.000 --> 10:46.000\nand just check out my fucking Prius, man.\n\n10:46.000 --> 10:48.000\nIt's just like moving around in a circle.\n\n10:48.000 --> 10:50.000\nWhat? Why?\n\n10:50.000 --> 10:54.000\nI think that was built originally for a chit-choo train.\n\n10:54.000 --> 10:58.000\nThe alleged purpose would be that you pull into the garage head first,\n\n10:58.000 --> 11:00.000\nyou don't have to back in and then turn it around.\n\n11:00.000 --> 11:02.000\nThat's fucking crazy.\n\n11:02.000 --> 11:04.000\nI mean, it's rad.\n\n11:04.000 --> 11:06.000\nBut it's not home, you know?\n\n11:06.000 --> 11:09.000\nThe place that we looked at was rad.\n\n11:09.000 --> 11:11.000\nI think that was Christian Slater who said that.\n\n11:11.000 --> 11:15.000\nThe walls looked like a place that you would build in No Man's Sky.\n\n11:15.000 --> 11:17.000\nIt was out of wood.\n\n11:17.000 --> 11:19.000\nIf you've ever played No Man's Sky and you've made a shelter out of wood,\n\n11:19.000 --> 11:21.000\nthat's what the outside of this game looks like.\n\n11:21.000 --> 11:23.000\nYou've lost the whole crowd now.\n\n11:23.000 --> 11:26.000\nYou're talking about video games and buying a giant mansion right now.\n\n11:26.000 --> 11:28.000\nI'm trying to get back.\n\n11:28.000 --> 11:30.000\nI know I lost them on the mansion.\n\n11:30.000 --> 11:32.000\nI'm getting them back with the fucking video game thing.\n\n11:32.000 --> 11:36.000\nHow big does your house need to be for you to be comfortable?\n\n11:36.000 --> 11:39.000\nIs size the important thing here?\n\n11:39.000 --> 11:41.000\nYou're just you and Cody.\n\n11:41.000 --> 11:43.000\nHow big does the house need to be?\n\n11:43.000 --> 11:45.000\nSize is important to me.\n\n11:45.000 --> 11:47.000\nSorry, I'm picking peanuts out of my teeth.\n\n11:47.000 --> 11:49.000\nYou also went a little lift gal right there.\n\n11:49.000 --> 11:51.000\nSize is important.\n\n11:51.000 --> 11:55.000\nYou need room for a hairy to go where there are hundreds.\n\n11:55.000 --> 11:57.000\nGet out.\n\n11:57.000 --> 11:59.000\nSize is important to me.\n\n11:59.000 --> 12:01.000\nI want floor space and elbow room.\n\n12:01.000 --> 12:03.000\nWhatever. I got it.\n\n12:03.000 --> 12:11.000\nThere was this one place that we looked at, the rad place that was not home.\n\n12:11.000 --> 12:13.000\nI would feel fat living here.\n\n12:13.000 --> 12:19.000\nThis is a place for a person that is on display or something.\n\n12:19.000 --> 12:21.000\nIt's an interesting radical house.\n\n12:21.000 --> 12:27.000\nWhen you went down the stairs, there was a bookshelf at the bottom of the stairs.\n\n12:27.000 --> 12:31.000\nAnd then the bookshelf was a secret door.\n\n12:31.000 --> 12:35.000\nFor a little chamber.\n\n12:35.000 --> 12:41.000\nThey said a panic room, but if I'm panicked, I'm not going down half of the stairs.\n\n12:41.000 --> 12:43.000\nIt's not a panic room.\n\n12:43.000 --> 12:47.000\nWhere would you go if you were panicked?\n\n12:47.000 --> 12:49.000\nI'll get on that later.\n\n12:49.000 --> 12:51.000\nBut I got inspired by it.\n\n12:51.000 --> 12:57.000\nI'm like, that's the only thing that I want in the house that I want.\n\n12:57.000 --> 13:03.000\nI'm going to have a contractor make a bookcase door on this big closet.\n\n13:03.000 --> 13:07.000\nAnd I'm going to put all of the monitors in there for all of the security cameras.\n\n13:07.000 --> 13:11.000\nSo that if I'm having a party, I can be like Alfred, mind the guests.\n\n13:11.000 --> 13:15.000\nAnd then I go down and I look two ways.\n\n13:15.000 --> 13:18.000\nI want to make it activated with a book.\n\n13:18.000 --> 13:22.000\nYou got to pull a book out and it goes click like a Goonies booby trap.\n\n13:22.000 --> 13:28.000\nAnd then it goes open and then you just go in there and just watch the perimeter through the monitors.\n\n13:28.000 --> 13:30.000\nI wouldn't put cameras in my house.\n\n13:30.000 --> 13:32.000\nYou can come to a party at my house. I'm not going to monitor you.\n\n13:32.000 --> 13:34.000\nI have my limits.\n\n13:34.000 --> 13:36.000\nYou've just said that you will.\n\n13:36.000 --> 13:40.000\nIf you're outside, I'll be watching you because I got to monitor that perimeter.\n\n13:40.000 --> 13:46.000\nWhat if you get like big, big paintings of people and you have their eyes be little cameras?\n\n13:46.000 --> 13:47.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n13:47.000 --> 13:49.000\nI got to mind my parent.\n\n13:49.000 --> 13:52.000\nBut once you're in my house, your civil liberties are safe.\n\n13:52.000 --> 13:55.000\nI'm not Chuck Berry. I'm not going to be like watching you poo poo.\n\n13:55.000 --> 13:58.000\nYou got to totes moms the params.\n\n13:58.000 --> 14:05.000\nNow, let's say you had a library that the book was the lever that opened up the secret chamber.\n\n14:05.000 --> 14:09.000\nNow, obviously, we can't use this one after we say this.\n\n14:09.000 --> 14:14.000\nBut right now, what title of book would be the one that you would pull?\n\n14:14.000 --> 14:16.000\nI think we can use it.\n\n14:16.000 --> 14:19.000\nYou come over to my house and you find a bookcase.\n\n14:19.000 --> 14:21.000\nYou know what's behind there.\n\n14:21.000 --> 14:25.000\nAnd it's not like my suit of art or my actual Batman armors back there.\n\n14:25.000 --> 14:28.000\nLike I'm not a real crime fighter, but it's just fun to be like, you know.\n\n14:28.000 --> 14:32.000\nBut so, like, yeah, I mean, do you think, I mean, there's two ways to go here.\n\n14:32.000 --> 14:35.000\nRight now, you've got the Encyclopedia Britannica.\n\n14:35.000 --> 14:39.000\nYou've got all of Vonnegut. You've got this. You've got that.\n\n14:39.000 --> 14:41.000\nWhat is the one that you would pull?\n\n14:41.000 --> 14:46.000\nWhat's a fall of the House of Usher? Is that like because you're like walled in?\n\n14:46.000 --> 14:50.000\nWhat are what are books about books or doors?\n\n14:50.000 --> 14:56.000\nMy question is because it's an interesting thought is would it be your favorite book or something that was somatic?\n\n14:56.000 --> 14:59.000\nLike you're saying you got thematic, you know, you got thematic.\n\n14:59.000 --> 15:00.000\nYeah.\n\n15:00.000 --> 15:06.000\nSo you don't let the right one in.\n\n15:06.000 --> 15:07.000\nI don't know.\n\n15:07.000 --> 15:17.000\nI mean, there's a novelization of the Doors movie behind the Green Door.\n\n15:17.000 --> 15:23.000\nBut you know, I'd go meta and just have the book be like I would I would I would do every single book fake.\n\n15:23.000 --> 15:27.000\nI would I would I would I would it would be like one book says this is the one you're looking for.\n\n15:27.000 --> 15:33.000\nYeah, one book would be like will be like tales from the secret door knob.\n\n15:33.000 --> 15:35.000\nDon't touch this book.\n\n15:35.000 --> 15:36.000\nYeah.\n\n15:36.000 --> 15:38.000\nThat would be the one.\n\n15:38.000 --> 15:39.000\nIt's going to be great.\n\n15:39.000 --> 15:40.000\nSo you're in escrow.\n\n15:40.000 --> 15:42.000\nI've never tried to buy a house.\n\n15:42.000 --> 15:44.000\nSo what does that mean for you right now?\n\n15:44.000 --> 15:54.000\nEscrow is a flux period of where the buyer no longer has to bid against other people.\n\n15:54.000 --> 15:56.000\nI think bidding is closed.\n\n15:56.000 --> 15:58.000\nAnd then it's like.\n\n15:58.000 --> 15:59.000\nWas you versus the bank?\n\n15:59.000 --> 16:03.000\nIt's no it's just it's no it's just a period of time.\n\n16:03.000 --> 16:15.000\nIt's like a it's like a it's just like a handshake before the before the sex kind of like it's there's still there's still time to there's still time to get out of the deal.\n\n16:15.000 --> 16:17.000\nMostly on the fire side.\n\n16:17.000 --> 16:18.000\nI just had sex.\n\n16:18.000 --> 16:21.000\nI just had sex on the night and the handshake.\n\n16:21.000 --> 16:23.000\nTake their hand and you're like pleasure.\n\n16:23.000 --> 16:27.000\nIt's a pleasure about to do business with it.\n\n16:27.000 --> 16:34.000\nIt's like it's like it's made like for me on my side it's a time for me to send over inspectors and stuff.\n\n16:34.000 --> 16:40.000\nSo you like have someone look at the fireplaces you have someone check out the wiring look for tarantula nests.\n\n16:40.000 --> 16:41.000\nI don't know.\n\n16:41.000 --> 16:46.000\nAnd it's like a time to like negotiate a little bit if you find something that's fucked up like there's a gas leak in this house.\n\n16:46.000 --> 16:52.000\nLike you got to knock off a little of the price because I'm going to fix it when I move in or are you going to fix it before I move in.\n\n16:52.000 --> 16:56.000\nBut you'll be leaving the neighborhood you'll be moving to the valley now.\n\n16:56.000 --> 16:57.000\nYeah.\n\n16:57.000 --> 16:58.000\nYeah.\n\n16:58.000 --> 16:59.000\nYeah.\n\n16:59.000 --> 17:05.000\nI wish I could say more but it's not like we ever hang out and like you live walking distance from my place.\n\n17:05.000 --> 17:07.000\nWe never hang out.\n\n17:07.000 --> 17:11.000\nI'll see you as much in the Valley Valley villages we do now.\n\n17:11.000 --> 17:12.000\nI think so.\n\n17:12.000 --> 17:13.000\nI'll keep my old place.\n\n17:13.000 --> 17:16.000\nSo it'll be like a pietta tear overlooking the drawing room.\n\n17:16.000 --> 17:18.000\nWhat's that going to be like a bed and breakfast?\n\n17:18.000 --> 17:19.000\nWhat are you making there?\n\n17:19.000 --> 17:20.000\nI don't know.\n\n17:20.000 --> 17:21.000\nA pietta tear baby.\n\n17:21.000 --> 17:22.000\nA pietta tear.\n\n17:22.000 --> 17:23.000\nYeah.\n\n17:23.000 --> 17:24.000\nFor who?\n\n17:24.000 --> 17:25.000\nMe.\n\n17:25.000 --> 17:27.000\nYou'll have your own pietta tear.\n\n17:27.000 --> 17:28.000\nYeah.\n\n17:28.000 --> 17:33.000\nNo I'm going to fix it up and see and then I'll feel out like could I rent this yearly?\n\n17:33.000 --> 17:38.000\nWhat was the desire to leave that place and get a new one?\n\n17:38.000 --> 17:42.000\nCody like I want to like Cody didn't want to move into a dude's house.\n\n17:42.000 --> 17:47.000\nYou know she want to pick a house with a dude and like so that we're starting a new chapter together.\n\n17:47.000 --> 17:52.000\nAnd it needs it needed to be bigger.\n\n17:52.000 --> 17:58.000\nDid you have a bubble throat there?\n\n17:58.000 --> 17:59.000\nYeah.\n\n17:59.000 --> 18:02.000\nI think I'd still be moving around this time anyway but I probably would have ended up\n\n18:02.000 --> 18:06.000\nin a rad house with a fucking carousel garage.\n\n18:06.000 --> 18:09.000\nI mean I've talked to people who bought some of these modern houses.\n\n18:09.000 --> 18:14.000\nJust have a pool and a back house that I can just squat in whenever I need to swim.\n\n18:14.000 --> 18:16.000\nMy house is like a hotel now.\n\n18:16.000 --> 18:21.000\nI'm actually actively in the market for a Cato.\n\n18:21.000 --> 18:22.000\nYeah I'm good.\n\n18:22.000 --> 18:25.000\nI may end up having to murder someone in the same way.\n\n18:25.000 --> 18:27.000\nWell no get a Cato first and then murder somebody.\n\n18:27.000 --> 18:29.000\nThat's exactly what I'm saying.\n\n18:29.000 --> 18:31.000\nWhat are you talking about?\n\n18:31.000 --> 18:33.000\nYou gotta get you get a Cato Kalen and then you murder somebody.\n\n18:33.000 --> 18:35.000\nI know.\n\n18:35.000 --> 18:37.000\nYou think I can't help murder somebody?\n\n18:37.000 --> 18:40.000\nOh well no Cato didn't help.\n\n18:40.000 --> 18:41.000\nHe's just a witness.\n\n18:41.000 --> 18:42.000\nOh okay.\n\n18:42.000 --> 18:43.000\nHe wasn't even a witness.\n\n18:43.000 --> 18:46.000\nHe just happened to be in the back house and he heard a thump on the wall.\n\n18:46.000 --> 18:47.000\nHe heard a thump.\n\n18:47.000 --> 18:48.000\nYeah.\n\n18:48.000 --> 18:49.000\nIt's a witness.\n\n18:49.000 --> 18:50.000\nYou're a witness.\n\n18:50.000 --> 18:56.000\nIt could have been the thump of corrupt LAPD with a systemic race problem.\n\n18:56.000 --> 19:00.000\nThat's my John Travolta as what's his name?\n\n19:00.000 --> 19:01.000\nOh shit.\n\n19:01.000 --> 19:02.000\nWhat's his name?\n\n19:02.000 --> 19:03.000\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n19:03.000 --> 19:04.000\nThe lawyer.\n\n19:04.000 --> 19:05.000\nCome on guys.\n\n19:05.000 --> 19:06.000\nRobert.\n\n19:06.000 --> 19:07.000\nNo the other one.\n\n19:07.000 --> 19:08.000\nNot the Kardashian.\n\n19:08.000 --> 19:10.000\nNo that's the black guy.\n\n19:10.000 --> 19:11.000\nShapiro.\n\n19:11.000 --> 19:12.000\nIs he Shapiro?\n\n19:12.000 --> 19:13.000\nRobert Shapiro.\n\n19:13.000 --> 19:14.000\nYeah.\n\n19:14.000 --> 19:15.000\nTravolta with Shapiro.\n\n19:15.000 --> 19:16.000\nYeah.\n\n19:16.000 --> 19:17.000\nWow.\n\n19:17.000 --> 19:21.000\nA lot of fun performances in that movie.\n\n19:21.000 --> 19:23.000\nAlright.\n\n19:23.000 --> 19:24.000\nYeah.\n\n19:24.000 --> 19:26.000\nRetiring from public life.\n\n19:26.000 --> 19:27.000\nNow would you have a pool?\n\n19:27.000 --> 19:30.000\nHow much time do you think you Dan Harmon are going to spend?\n\n19:30.000 --> 19:32.000\nI think we've covered this topic.\n\n19:32.000 --> 19:33.000\nAlright.\n\n19:33.000 --> 19:37.000\nNot much was the answer.\n\n19:37.000 --> 19:40.000\nNot much was the answer.\n\n19:40.000 --> 19:42.000\nSo Escrow I asked how long?\n\n19:42.000 --> 19:45.000\nHow long you might pull the trigger on having this new home?\n\n19:45.000 --> 19:46.000\n30 days.\n\n19:46.000 --> 19:47.000\n30 days.\n\n19:47.000 --> 19:48.000\nYeah.\n\n19:48.000 --> 19:52.000\nAnd then I'm going to, but I'm like, I'm going to take my sweet time because I love\n\n19:52.000 --> 19:54.000\nmy current house so I'm going to sit over there.\n\n19:54.000 --> 20:00.000\nI have people installing right now like this crazy like electronic system in my old house.\n\n20:00.000 --> 20:02.000\nThey don't even know they're doing it in a...\n\n20:02.000 --> 20:03.000\nYour old house.\n\n20:03.000 --> 20:04.000\nYeah.\n\n20:04.000 --> 20:06.000\nBut I'm auditioning them unawares.\n\n20:06.000 --> 20:09.000\nLike I'm like let's see if you've got the right stuff.\n\n20:09.000 --> 20:12.000\nMaybe I'll let you wire up my bigger house.\n\n20:12.000 --> 20:15.000\nI'm just watching them and pretending I live there.\n\n20:15.000 --> 20:18.000\nI'm like, oh, what if I wanted to play the stereo?\n\n20:18.000 --> 20:23.000\nOh, well, you know, then you'd go like this.\n\n20:23.000 --> 20:28.000\nOr maybe I just go over to my other bigger house, listen to music over there.\n\n20:28.000 --> 20:30.000\nYou dumb piece of shit.\n\n20:30.000 --> 20:31.000\nGet back to work.\n\n20:31.000 --> 20:32.000\nWhat happens to your fish?\n\n20:32.000 --> 20:33.000\nHow did the fish get to?\n\n20:33.000 --> 20:35.000\nOh, that is a tough subject.\n\n20:35.000 --> 20:36.000\nBecause you got fish.\n\n20:36.000 --> 20:37.000\nYeah, I got fish.\n\n20:37.000 --> 20:39.000\nAnd how do they get moved around?\n\n20:39.000 --> 20:41.000\nThey don't get moved.\n\n20:41.000 --> 20:42.000\nWhat?\n\n20:42.000 --> 20:43.000\nThat's a custom.\n\n20:43.000 --> 20:44.000\nYou're going to kill your fish?\n\n20:44.000 --> 20:46.000\nI'm not going to kill my fish.\n\n20:46.000 --> 20:48.000\nYou're going to have your fish murdered.\n\n20:48.000 --> 20:49.000\nCody.\n\n20:49.000 --> 20:50.000\nWink.\n\n20:50.000 --> 20:51.000\nAnd into the fish tank.\n\n20:51.000 --> 20:55.000\nIt's a custom, like if I can, Breckheimer fish tank.\n\n20:55.000 --> 20:58.000\nIt's like, it is very Michael Mann.\n\n20:58.000 --> 21:01.000\nIt was the fulfillment of a dream I had as a child.\n\n21:01.000 --> 21:04.000\nI wanted to have a saltwater fish tank.\n\n21:04.000 --> 21:14.000\nAnd then, like, McGathey and I, like kind of custom designed one for the corner, McGathey built this beautiful tavern in my old house.\n\n21:14.000 --> 21:17.000\nAnd part of that was she knew I wanted that fish tank.\n\n21:17.000 --> 21:21.000\nAnd it's like, you know, I've now scratched that itch.\n\n21:21.000 --> 21:23.000\nI'm not a fish tank guy.\n\n21:23.000 --> 21:25.000\nAre these fish going to die?\n\n21:25.000 --> 21:26.000\nWhat's going to happen to you?\n\n21:26.000 --> 21:29.000\nI don't know how it works when you move out and you've got a fish tank.\n\n21:29.000 --> 21:31.000\nI'm pretty sure it's up to you.\n\n21:31.000 --> 21:34.000\nI'm pretty sure that you have your finger on that trigger.\n\n21:34.000 --> 21:38.000\nWell, I don't, yeah, I mean, I don't know if you just like, but I'm saying like, I don't know if you just like,\n\n21:38.000 --> 21:42.000\nYou just wait for the fish that are in there to die of old age.\n\n21:42.000 --> 21:47.000\nLike, do you just like keep coming back and visiting them and going like, hey, how's it going, Greg?\n\n21:47.000 --> 21:49.000\nLike still kicking, huh?\n\n21:49.000 --> 21:51.000\nBoy, getting pretty empty in there.\n\n21:51.000 --> 21:53.000\nYeah, well, we're fish, you know.\n\n21:53.000 --> 21:57.000\nUsually, usually there's a bit more turnover than this.\n\n21:57.000 --> 21:59.000\nIt's just me and the snails now.\n\n21:59.000 --> 22:03.000\nI don't expect you to understand how it works out here, but I moved.\n\n22:03.000 --> 22:05.000\nWell, there's plenty of water in here.\n\n22:05.000 --> 22:09.000\nHow many current alive fish do you have?\n\n22:09.000 --> 22:10.000\nI don't even know.\n\n22:10.000 --> 22:12.000\nThat's why I know I'm not a fish tank guy.\n\n22:12.000 --> 22:13.000\nI don't have names.\n\n22:13.000 --> 22:14.000\nYou're a fish murderer.\n\n22:14.000 --> 22:17.000\nYou might as well be like on Deadliest Catch.\n\n22:17.000 --> 22:19.000\nI'm a fish murderer the same way I am.\n\n22:19.000 --> 22:23.000\nYeah, I'm like how murderer when I buy because I'm not vegan.\n\n22:23.000 --> 22:28.000\nI mean, which is a lot because I'm not supporting a marketplace that like,\n\n22:28.000 --> 22:32.000\nby buying fish and putting them on display in my house,\n\n22:32.000 --> 22:37.000\nI incentivized a marketplace that someone out there is catching and breeding fish.\n\n22:37.000 --> 22:38.000\nYeah, but you...\n\n22:38.000 --> 22:40.000\nI'm not going to kill these fish.\n\n22:40.000 --> 22:44.000\nThese fish are fucking as happy as you can get in a tank.\n\n22:44.000 --> 22:46.000\nThere's no way to transport these fish into your new place.\n\n22:46.000 --> 22:48.000\nAre you saying you're done with these fish?\n\n22:48.000 --> 22:50.000\nYeah, I'm not a fish tank guy.\n\n22:50.000 --> 22:54.000\nWhich means you're a fish murderer.\n\n22:54.000 --> 22:56.000\nThese fish can go...\n\n22:56.000 --> 22:58.000\nI think you're projecting a lot in there.\n\n22:58.000 --> 23:00.000\nCould you send these fish to a better home is what I mean?\n\n23:00.000 --> 23:02.000\nYeah, I'm sure you can.\n\n23:02.000 --> 23:07.000\nDo you think I'm going to put them in a net and whip them across the yard or something?\n\n23:10.000 --> 23:13.000\nThat would be harder than leaving them where they're alive.\n\n23:13.000 --> 23:17.000\nBut how hard, it seems very hard to find a home for fish.\n\n23:17.000 --> 23:19.000\nI know.\n\n23:19.000 --> 23:20.000\nNext door app.\n\n23:20.000 --> 23:21.000\nNext door app.\n\n23:21.000 --> 23:26.000\nYeah, I can check in with these maniacs that are...\n\n23:26.000 --> 23:28.000\nYeah, I should check back in on that.\n\n23:28.000 --> 23:33.000\nI wonder if Rebecca ever got her secondhand bark collar\n\n23:33.000 --> 23:39.000\nso that she could try one out without expending too much on her mission to make her dog not bark.\n\n23:39.000 --> 23:42.000\nGod damn it, who was that guy that was on her case?\n\n23:42.000 --> 23:47.000\nIt was like, your dog is barking because he's psychologically scarred.\n\n23:47.000 --> 23:50.000\nAnd then everyone else was like, give him pills.\n\n23:50.000 --> 23:52.000\nI got pills. Come over, get some pills.\n\n23:52.000 --> 23:54.000\nOh, I'd love to try those pills.\n\n23:54.000 --> 23:58.000\nYou're all insane. You need to socialize your dogs.\n\n23:58.000 --> 24:00.000\nShut up, Greg.\n\n24:00.000 --> 24:02.000\nGreg's the name of the fish, too.\n\n24:02.000 --> 24:03.000\nRight, yeah.\n\n24:03.000 --> 24:05.000\nI'm not good at making up names.\n\n24:08.000 --> 24:10.000\nSo the fish will find the home?\n\n24:10.000 --> 24:16.000\nThe fish, if I do nothing, which is what I've done as a fish owner here to for,\n\n24:16.000 --> 24:21.000\nlike, the fish stay alive.

--> 33:26.000\nYeah.\n\n33:26.000 --> 33:27.000\nI didn't get the top model?\n\n33:27.000 --> 33:29.000\nNo, I think we talked about it.\n\n33:29.000 --> 33:30.000\nWe could do that.\n\n33:30.000 --> 33:32.000\nIt's $300 more.\n\n33:32.000 --> 33:35.000\nIs it America's top model?\n\n33:35.000 --> 33:38.000\nDan.\n\n33:38.000 --> 33:39.000\nDad.\n\n33:39.000 --> 33:40.000\nDan.\n\n33:40.000 --> 33:41.000\nDad.\n\n33:41.000 --> 33:44.000\nOh, is that what this is?\n\n33:44.000 --> 33:46.000\nAm I your dad now?\n\n33:46.000 --> 33:47.000\nCody ordered me a shirt.\n\n33:47.000 --> 33:50.000\nI will take my belt off right now, Dan.\n\n33:50.000 --> 33:55.000\nCody ordered me a shirt that's aware when it came in tonight.\n\n33:55.000 --> 33:59.000\nBut there was a shirt online that says dad jokes.\n\n33:59.000 --> 34:01.000\nI think you mean rad jokes.\n\n34:01.000 --> 34:07.000\nBut the thing is, the photo of the shirt, like the advertisement for it, it's a picture of a shirt.\n\n34:07.000 --> 34:15.000\nAnd then there's two converse all-stars coming in frame, laying on the corner of the shirt,\n\n34:15.000 --> 34:18.000\njust to make it more rad, the shirt.\n\n34:18.000 --> 34:24.000\nAnd I was like, well, I want the shirt, but I want the tennis shoes in there, too.\n\n34:24.000 --> 34:26.000\nI want the whole shirt on a shirt.\n\n34:26.000 --> 34:31.000\nSo she ordered the shirt, and the shirt's got a picture of a shirt on it with shoes on it.\n\n34:31.000 --> 34:33.000\nThe shirt says dad jokes.\n\n34:33.000 --> 34:35.000\nI think you mean rad jokes.\n\n34:35.000 --> 34:37.000\nIt's a confusing shirt.\n\n34:37.000 --> 34:39.000\nCan you show me?\n\n34:39.000 --> 34:42.000\nWe can't show the whole audience, but I'd like to see this.\n\n34:42.000 --> 34:44.000\nOkay, okay.\n\n34:44.000 --> 34:46.000\nIt feels like a courtroom.\n\n34:46.000 --> 34:48.000\nSure, the bailiff.\n\n34:48.000 --> 34:51.000\nOh, that's nice.\n\n34:51.000 --> 34:54.000\nLike it's a shirt with a picture of a shirt on it, right?\n\n34:54.000 --> 34:56.000\nYeah.\n\n34:56.000 --> 34:58.000\nYeah, it's a shirt with a picture of a shirt on it.\n\n34:58.000 --> 35:00.000\nIt's like a hat on a hat.\n\n35:00.000 --> 35:02.000\nIt's a shirt on a shirt.\n\n35:02.000 --> 35:06.000\nIt's a shoe on a shirt on a shirt.\n\n35:06.000 --> 35:08.000\nWell, there's no guest tonight, by the way.\n\n35:08.000 --> 35:11.000\nWhat do you think Colin Hanks is going to come out and make it worth your time?\n\n35:11.000 --> 35:13.000\nNo. This is all you get.\n\n35:13.000 --> 35:15.000\nNo, so-and-so.\n\n35:15.000 --> 35:20.000\nI think we should do is try to really get back on track on D&D.\n\n35:20.000 --> 35:26.000\nSpencer, I think tonight brought, he brought the character sheets and the whole flim flam, right?\n\n35:26.000 --> 35:27.000\nYeah.\n\n35:27.000 --> 35:30.000\nYou got dice of your own, and we don't have to go out to the crowd.\n\n35:30.000 --> 35:36.000\nAnd I say we really, Dan, you, me, Spencer, get to really figure out where we are,\n\n35:36.000 --> 35:41.000\nremember what was going on, and then begin again afresh.\n\n35:41.000 --> 35:45.000\nYeah. Why did I get a new MacBook Pro, you're asking?\n\n35:45.000 --> 35:49.000\nDan, don't you have like 90 laptops?\n\n35:49.000 --> 35:51.000\nDan, I have a question for you.\n\n35:51.000 --> 35:52.000\nYeah.\n\n35:52.000 --> 35:54.000\nWhy did you get a new MacBook Pro?\n\n35:54.000 --> 35:57.000\nBecause I've been making music on my iPad Pro.\n\n35:57.000 --> 36:00.000\nI took Apple at face value when they said,\n\n36:00.000 --> 36:04.000\nyou can now produce music on this iPad Pro.\n\n36:04.000 --> 36:06.000\nIt has a USB-C port in it.\n\n36:06.000 --> 36:08.000\nThat opens you up to limitless possibilities.\n\n36:08.000 --> 36:12.000\nI was like, okay, I'm going to get on the board with this.\n\n36:12.000 --> 36:14.000\nI follow Henny the business on YouTube.\n\n36:14.000 --> 36:19.000\nHe's into the iPad Pro, and he's written music for Drake or something.\n\n36:19.000 --> 36:22.000\nAnd he's like, people are going to be making music with the iPad Pro.\n\n36:22.000 --> 36:24.000\nI'm like, he's Henny the business.\n\n36:24.000 --> 36:27.000\nHe does tutorials and stuff.\n\n36:27.000 --> 36:33.000\nAll this time, last year or so, I've been learning all these apps and things,\n\n36:33.000 --> 36:37.000\nspending all this money, USB cables and things.\n\n36:37.000 --> 36:39.000\nThey're all buggy.\n\n36:39.000 --> 36:42.000\nHere's the only program that works on the iPad Pro for making music.\n\n36:42.000 --> 36:46.000\nGarageBand, that's it, without crashing, without having some fatal bug.\n\n36:46.000 --> 36:49.000\nAll the other ones are just like these weird experimental things.\n\n36:49.000 --> 36:51.000\nThey have different bugs.\n\n36:51.000 --> 36:55.000\nIf you don't want the bug that's in Cubases too, you can use Oreo Pro,\n\n36:55.000 --> 36:57.000\nbut you've got a different bug.\n\n36:57.000 --> 37:01.000\nYou can't have bugs that are just like, oh shit,\n\n37:01.000 --> 37:06.000\nif you work for an hour on this song, this shit happens that makes it all weird.\n\n37:06.000 --> 37:08.000\nThat's not acceptable.\n\n37:08.000 --> 37:10.000\nI was like, we're not ready for this.\n\n37:10.000 --> 37:12.000\nIt's like VR technology.\n\n37:12.000 --> 37:14.000\nWe keep pretending we want to be in the future,\n\n37:14.000 --> 37:17.000\nand it's like, you're going to be making music on your iPad Pro.\n\n37:17.000 --> 37:18.000\nNo, you're not.\n\n37:18.000 --> 37:20.000\nIt's a fucking giant iPhone.\n\n37:20.000 --> 37:22.000\nGet your shit together, Apple.\n\n37:22.000 --> 37:24.000\nSuck my titty.\n\n37:24.000 --> 37:29.000\nI guess they announced a new iOS for iPads today.\n\n37:29.000 --> 37:33.000\nTwo steps forward, one step back.\n\n37:33.000 --> 37:37.000\nThere already was an iPad iOS, and then they merged it with the fucking iPhone iOS,\n\n37:37.000 --> 37:40.000\nand now it's like, oh no, you need a special iPad iOS.\n\n37:40.000 --> 37:41.000\nYeah, why?\n\n37:41.000 --> 37:43.000\nBecause you think if you're holding a big giant fucking thing in your hands,\n\n37:43.000 --> 37:45.000\nyou might want it to work like a goddamn laptop.\n\n37:45.000 --> 37:48.000\nYou fucking Apple turds.\n\n37:48.000 --> 37:50.000\nSo I just got a laptop.\n\n37:50.000 --> 37:51.000\nI'm like, what am I doing?\n\n37:51.000 --> 37:53.000\nI'm sitting in bed in my pajamas.\n\n37:53.000 --> 37:55.000\nI'm trying to make music.\n\n37:55.000 --> 38:00.000\nI've laptop weighs the same, and it's apparently the only thing that's not going to crash every time.\n\n38:00.000 --> 38:04.000\nLogic Pro seems really cool.\n\n38:04.000 --> 38:09.000\nSo I'm going to be making even better music now, Jeff.\n\n38:09.000 --> 38:14.000\nI've been enjoying your Instagram little music nuggets.\n\n38:14.000 --> 38:19.000\nYeah, and I want to wire my car for audio so that I can...\n\n38:19.000 --> 38:24.000\nIt's just awful singing in the car, and then you bring it home,\n\n38:24.000 --> 38:30.000\nand you're trying to EQ out the car sound, and it's just bad.\n\n38:30.000 --> 38:33.000\nI keep trying to keep getting all these different mics.\n\n38:33.000 --> 38:35.000\nI got a lav mic and put it on my seatbelt.\n\n38:35.000 --> 38:36.000\nFor real?\n\n38:36.000 --> 38:38.000\nYeah, and it didn't work.\n\n38:38.000 --> 38:41.000\nYou can probably get one in your headliner up here above you.\n\n38:41.000 --> 38:48.000\nI tried. Lav mics won't work because lav mics have this reaction to the background sound of the car\n\n38:48.000 --> 38:52.000\nthat's actually even worse than the built-in mic on the iPhone.\n\n38:52.000 --> 38:56.000\nAs soon as you start driving in the car, there's sound from outside,\n\n38:56.000 --> 38:58.000\nthe lav mics go fucking insane.\n\n38:58.000 --> 39:02.000\nThey think that you're dragging it down a gravel path, and it blows out all of the audio.\n\n39:02.000 --> 39:05.000\nSo you need a hardwired mic in your car.\n\n39:05.000 --> 39:10.000\nYeah, I need to get shotgun mics that are special and point them out.\n\n39:10.000 --> 39:12.000\nI bet if you got on the phone...\n\n39:12.000 --> 39:14.000\nDo that again?\n\n39:14.000 --> 39:18.000\nYeah, I need to get special shotgun mics.\n\n39:18.000 --> 39:21.000\nOne over here, one over here.\n\n39:21.000 --> 39:26.000\nI bet if you called a sweetwater or the Sam Ash or the people like that, they would...\n\n39:26.000 --> 39:27.000\nYeah.\n\n39:27.000 --> 39:28.000\nDon't die.\n\n39:28.000 --> 39:32.000\nOh, no, no. That's not how I'm going to die.\n\n39:32.000 --> 39:35.000\nWere you coughing at the mention of sweetwater?\n\n39:35.000 --> 39:39.000\nYeah, well, I'm coughing at the mention of working with audio people.\n\n39:39.000 --> 39:43.000\nNo offense to our audio people.\n\n39:43.000 --> 39:47.000\nI mean, I know that is the solution, but it's just like...\n\n39:47.000 --> 39:50.000\nYeah, but they would sort that out for you like straight off the bat.\n\n39:50.000 --> 39:55.000\nIt's just hard because the vibration translates like through the whole frame of the car.\n\n39:55.000 --> 39:59.000\nThey don't go into audio because their personalities are wonderful.\n\n39:59.000 --> 40:01.000\nI hope our audio people didn't hear that.\n\n40:01.000 --> 40:05.000\nWhat are some jobs that you go into because your personalities are wonderful?\n\n40:05.000 --> 40:07.000\nLike an actor.\n\n40:07.000 --> 40:12.000\nYou know, I wish my car needed acting.\n\n40:12.000 --> 40:15.000\nI called Joel McHale.\n\n40:15.000 --> 40:17.000\nI've had him in my car.\n\n40:17.000 --> 40:19.000\nIt makes the car better at acting.\n\n40:19.000 --> 40:21.000\nIt's great. Actors are great.\n\n40:21.000 --> 40:22.000\nVery pleasant people.\n\n40:22.000 --> 40:27.000\nTechnically psychotic, I mean, their job is to pretend cameras aren't there.\n\n40:27.000 --> 40:29.000\nIt takes a little bit of a...\n\n40:29.000 --> 40:32.000\nBut I mean, they don't make that your problem.\n\n40:32.000 --> 40:33.000\nThey're performers.\n\n40:33.000 --> 40:35.000\nI don't trust that actors are good people.\n\n40:35.000 --> 40:37.000\nI just trust that they're being good at acting.\n\n40:37.000 --> 40:40.000\nRight, their personalities are great.\n\n40:40.000 --> 40:42.000\nWell, their acted personalities are.\n\n40:42.000 --> 40:46.000\nYeah, their front-facing personalities.\n\n40:46.000 --> 40:48.000\nThe part that you have to touch.\n\n40:48.000 --> 40:50.000\nThat's great.\n\n40:50.000 --> 40:54.000\nIt doesn't have audio guys sweat on it.\n\n40:54.000 --> 40:57.000\nBut you're going to suffer now by not having...\n\n40:57.000 --> 40:58.000\nYou're going to have to try...\n\n40:58.000 --> 41:02.000\nWe're going to suffer because our audio guys are going to put fart sounds all over the rest of the show.\n\n41:02.000 --> 41:05.000\nSlurpee, slurp, slurp sounds.\n\n41:05.000 --> 41:10.000\nBut that would be pretty cool to trick out your car with mics so you could just have always a camera on you\n\n41:10.000 --> 41:13.000\nand always have mics on you that you could just do whatever you wanted.\n\n41:13.000 --> 41:16.000\nYeah, I want to take that on as a little hobby.\n\n41:16.000 --> 41:19.000\nGet excited about the technical application of it.\n\n41:19.000 --> 41:22.000\nBecause I find that when I get into just the...\n\n41:22.000 --> 41:26.000\nBy the time I get that figured out, that's when I start to like...\n\n41:26.000 --> 41:28.000\nI lose interest in the creative.\n\n41:28.000 --> 41:32.000\nWhy don't you call up the people that do cash cab or something like that and just say, hey...\n\n41:32.000 --> 41:37.000\nI think there's people I could bring into it.\n\n41:37.000 --> 41:38.000\nI just kind of...\n\n41:38.000 --> 41:40.000\nWhy don't you do cash cab?\n\n41:40.000 --> 41:44.000\nYeah, once you get it all figured out, you can just do cash cab.\n\n41:44.000 --> 41:47.000\nI think cash cab doesn't drive very fast.\n\n41:47.000 --> 41:51.000\nSo once you hit a certain speed, it kind of changes the nature of the vibration.\n\n41:51.000 --> 41:53.000\nYeah, because in New York, you never go anywhere.\n\n41:53.000 --> 41:55.000\nYou're stuck at a stoplight the entire time.\n\n41:55.000 --> 42:00.000\nI guess part of the reason I don't immediately ask for outside help is because\n\n42:00.000 --> 42:03.000\nI really love going to Fry's electronics.\n\n42:03.000 --> 42:05.000\nI just love to spend a weekend there.\n\n42:05.000 --> 42:09.000\nWhen you go into Fry's, do you like finding a clerk there and saying, hey...\n\n42:09.000 --> 42:11.000\nNo, I love that it's a wasteland now.\n\n42:11.000 --> 42:16.000\nI love that the internet has turned Fry's into just this weird ghost town.\n\n42:16.000 --> 42:20.000\nSo you're just freestyling in there and just saying, I think this is what's going to work.\n\n42:20.000 --> 42:24.000\nI just wander down Isles and go, oh, that looks like it's shaped like a metal thing.\n\n42:24.000 --> 42:27.000\nAnd you never see a clerk and go, hey, buddy, come over here.\n\n42:27.000 --> 42:32.000\nIf you see a clerk, they nervously dart into a back room with a box that they were taping up.\n\n42:32.000 --> 42:38.000\nTheir job is to index the plexiglass that has all of the shit locked down\n\n42:38.000 --> 42:41.000\nthat could be stolen and valuable.\n\n42:41.000 --> 42:48.000\nThe only people there are people that need shit that you can get faster\n\n42:48.000 --> 42:51.000\nby driving down to Fry's than you can on Amazon, which is like...\n\n42:51.000 --> 42:56.000\nWhen you had your fish tank angularly fixed into the wall of your place,\n\n42:56.000 --> 42:59.000\nyou didn't just go freestyle. You had somebody on the phone.\n\n42:59.000 --> 43:01.000\nOr was that Aaron doing that?\n\n43:01.000 --> 43:04.000\nI'm saying at some point you've reached out to the strangers and said,\n\n43:04.000 --> 43:07.000\nI need help with this. Let's make this great.\n\n43:07.000 --> 43:13.000\nOh, you mean the ongoing eight-year process of trying to make my house\n\n43:13.000 --> 43:16.000\nable to play a Phil Collins song when I want to hear one?\n\n43:16.000 --> 43:23.000\nYeah, that $1.2 million project, consisting of team after team\n\n43:23.000 --> 43:26.000\nof fucking professionals coming in for consultations\n\n43:26.000 --> 43:31.000\nand then ripping the walls apart and putting more fucking ethernet cable\n\n43:31.000 --> 43:35.000\nthroughout it and asking me more questions\n\n43:35.000 --> 43:39.000\nand only to tell me that what I want doesn't work with whatever the fuck.\n\n43:39.000 --> 43:46.000\nThat little hobby, yeah, not satisfying, which is why I kind of...\n\n43:46.000 --> 43:53.000\nMaybe it's a recourse to my self-esteem and masculinity\n\n43:53.000 --> 43:57.000\nor something that I want to wire my car for sound and have control over.\n\n43:57.000 --> 44:02.000\nI would literally put a little mixer on my dashboard or something.\n\n44:02.000 --> 44:04.000\nJust don't kill yourself in your car.\n\n44:04.000 --> 44:08.000\nMake sure that your eyes are on the road when you're doing all this.\n\n44:08.000 --> 44:11.000\nYou've already expressed that, and I find that adorable.\n\n44:11.000 --> 44:14.000\nEvery time I watch your videos, I love them and they're hilarious,\n\n44:14.000 --> 44:16.000\nbut I was like, oh, don't die on camera.\n\n44:16.000 --> 44:19.000\nBut then you wouldn't have died on camera because you go back and edit them\n\n44:19.000 --> 44:20.000\nand put lyrics on them.\n\n44:20.000 --> 44:26.000\nBut when I tell you that, of course, I'm driving carefully,\n\n44:26.000 --> 44:29.000\nyou're like, yeah, but your eyes are darting all around.\n\n44:29.000 --> 44:31.000\nYou're watching me drive defensively.\n\n44:31.000 --> 44:33.000\nI've never been in a car wreck.\n\n44:33.000 --> 44:35.000\nI'm a defensive driver.\n\n44:35.000 --> 44:39.000\nWhen I'm singing, you can see me being like...\n\n44:39.000 --> 44:43.000\nI have my own hang-ups about people worrying about people getting in car wrecks,\n\n44:43.000 --> 44:44.000\nso that's my own thing.\n\n44:44.000 --> 44:48.000\nI wish I was so good at singing that I could lose myself in it enough to have a car accident.\n\n44:48.000 --> 44:51.000\nI think that's Celine Dion you're thinking of.\n\n44:51.000 --> 44:53.000\nI'm not going to be like,\n\n44:53.000 --> 44:56.000\nlike close my eyes like Mariah Carey or something.\n\n44:56.000 --> 44:58.000\nI'm gesturing the notes that I'm getting.\n\n44:58.000 --> 45:00.000\nHave you seen that thing where...\n\n45:00.000 --> 45:04.000\nWhat's the fucking late night show host that I don't know?\n\n45:04.000 --> 45:06.000\nHe had Celine Dion in his car.\n\n45:06.000 --> 45:07.000\nJames Corden.\n\n45:07.000 --> 45:11.000\nYeah, and he brought Celine Dion in his car,\n\n45:11.000 --> 45:14.000\nand they just did karaoke in his car.\n\n45:14.000 --> 45:15.000\nIt's great.\n\n45:15.000 --> 45:16.000\nIt's really good.\n\n45:16.000 --> 45:18.000\nThen the whole time, I'm worried that they're going to die.\n\n45:18.000 --> 45:22.000\nSo you can wire a car for sound is what I'm hearing.\n\n45:22.000 --> 45:23.000\nI just got to figure it out.\n\n45:23.000 --> 45:27.000\nThey probably had a guy laying down in the backseat with a boom mic and shit.\n\n45:27.000 --> 45:31.000\nThat's how I've performed in cars.\n\n45:31.000 --> 45:33.000\nThere was always a boom guy in the backseat for real.\n\n45:33.000 --> 45:39.000\nThey probably had a sound mixer laying down in the back.\n\n45:39.000 --> 45:41.000\nI saw a guy on YouTube video.\n\n45:41.000 --> 45:42.000\nHe was like,\n\n45:42.000 --> 45:44.000\noh, here's how you podcast in your car.\n\n45:44.000 --> 45:47.000\nHe had a preamp that he recommended in live mics.\n\n45:47.000 --> 45:49.000\nHe said you put the live mic on your seatbelt,\n\n45:49.000 --> 45:53.000\nbut I thought I got everything that he recommended and it sounded like shit.\n\n45:53.000 --> 45:54.000\nI don't know if you mean...\n\n45:54.000 --> 45:55.000\nI don't know.\n\n45:55.000 --> 45:57.000\nThe thing might be you can't get on the freeway or something.\n\n45:57.000 --> 45:58.000\nIt definitely helps.\n\n45:58.000 --> 46:00.000\nI podcasted in my car too.\n\n46:00.000 --> 46:04.000\nThe faster you go, when you hit, say, 35, it gets worse.\n\n46:04.000 --> 46:06.000\n45 is a lot worse.\n\n46:06.000 --> 46:08.000\nAnd then there's different kind of consistencies of roads.\n\n46:08.000 --> 46:10.000\nSo like some roads, when I get on it gets all fucked up,\n\n46:10.000 --> 46:13.000\nbut if I stick to other ones, it's fine.\n\n46:13.000 --> 46:17.000\nI'm surprised that sound doesn't work like green video\n\n46:17.000 --> 46:19.000\nand that you could just say,\n\n46:19.000 --> 46:24.000\nhey, here's a sampling of the sound of my car on the freeway.\n\n46:24.000 --> 46:27.000\nRemove that from this audio.\n\n46:27.000 --> 46:28.000\nYou can.\n\n46:28.000 --> 46:30.000\nI don't think it's perfect, but you can definitely do that.\n\n46:30.000 --> 46:31.000\nIt definitely helps.\n\n46:31.000 --> 46:35.000\nIt's because there's a part of me saying the word pickle\n\n46:35.000 --> 46:39.000\nthat's also using the same part of the audio spectrum\n\n46:39.000 --> 46:41.000\nas the sound of the freeway.\n\n46:41.000 --> 46:42.000\nYeah.\n\n46:42.000 --> 46:46.000\nAnd so you can't do it without me sounding like...\n\n46:46.000 --> 46:49.000\nYou're removing freeway sounds from my throat.\n\n46:49.000 --> 46:52.000\nThere's all sorts of in-betweens though.\n\n46:52.000 --> 46:54.000\nYou can definitely get it better.\n\n46:54.000 --> 46:58.000\nAnd then there's also just like the better audio apps\n\n46:58.000 --> 47:02.000\nhave just a way to remove sounds below a certain threshold.\n\n47:02.000 --> 47:04.000\nSo like when you're talking or something\n\n47:04.000 --> 47:06.000\nor when you're not talking, if it's too quiet,\n\n47:06.000 --> 47:07.000\nyou just won't hear that.\n\n47:07.000 --> 47:09.000\nSo if it's like a low road sound, it'll just be gone.\n\n47:09.000 --> 47:13.000\nThere's something kind of satisfying about the pursuit of sound.\n\n47:13.000 --> 47:14.000\nOh yeah, it's great.\n\n47:14.000 --> 47:15.000\nI mean, I love sound.\n\n47:15.000 --> 47:16.000\nSounds so cool.\n\n47:16.000 --> 47:17.000\nAnd it's like, it's different.\n\n47:17.000 --> 47:18.000\nI don't know.\n\n47:18.000 --> 47:19.000\nVideo editing is probably the same,\n\n47:19.000 --> 47:20.000\nbut I just like audio editing.\n\n47:20.000 --> 47:21.000\nIt feels so powerful.\n\n47:21.000 --> 47:24.000\nYou can just really get your hands on it and like rip it apart\n\n47:24.000 --> 47:25.000\nand do stuff to it.\n\n47:25.000 --> 47:26.000\nAnd I don't even know what I'm doing.\n\n47:26.000 --> 47:27.000\nAnd I don't even know what I'm doing.\n\n47:27.000 --> 47:28.000\nSuch a thing is perfect silence.\n\n47:28.000 --> 47:32.000\nAnd you know, yeah, just like ways to like optimize.\n\n47:32.000 --> 47:36.000\nBut it's like beyond working in black and white,\n\n47:36.000 --> 47:39.000\nit's like you're just working in sound.\n\n47:39.000 --> 47:43.000\nAnd it's like, it's like, I think I can see the appeal of that.\n\n47:43.000 --> 47:46.000\nOr you're like, I could control this world.\n\n47:46.000 --> 47:50.000\nI want to do sound design and stuff.\n\n47:50.000 --> 47:51.000\nThat could be cool.\n\n47:51.000 --> 47:52.000\nYeah.\n\n47:52.000 --> 47:54.000\nHey, you want to, you want to, you want to,\n\n47:54.000 --> 47:57.000\nyou want me to give you a little starting library of stuff?\n\n47:57.000 --> 47:58.000\nSure.\n\n47:58.000 --> 48:00.000\nThis is a champagne cork.\n\n48:00.000 --> 48:02.000\nHoly shit.\n\n48:02.000 --> 48:08.000\nHere's a, here's a, here's a window opening.\n\n48:08.000 --> 48:13.000\nOld, old timey choo-choo train starting up.\n\n48:13.000 --> 48:25.000\nChoo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo...\n\n48:25.000 --> 48:27.000\nWoo-hoo!\n\n48:27.000 --> 48:28.000\nThat's very good.\n\n48:28.000 --> 48:29.000\nYeah, thank you.\n\n48:29.000 --> 48:32.000\nThe, the, the battle of Stalingrad.\n\n48:32.000 --> 48:33.000\nAh!\n\n48:35.000 --> 48:36.000\nDostoevsky!\n\n48:39.000 --> 48:40.000\nDostropia!\n\n48:40.000 --> 48:45.000\nOh, Dossboot!\n\n48:48.000 --> 48:50.000\nWow, there's a German guy in there.\n\n48:50.000 --> 48:52.000\nGerman sufferator.\n\n48:52.000 --> 48:54.000\nThey were fighting the Germans.\n\n48:54.000 --> 48:56.000\nYeah, someone lost their boot.\n\n48:56.000 --> 48:58.000\nOr found one of their...\n\n48:58.000 --> 49:01.000\nThat boot. That particular boot.\n\n49:01.000 --> 49:03.000\nThat's the weirdest part of that movie, Dossboot,\n\n49:03.000 --> 49:06.000\nis when the guy just looked at the camera and says,\n\n49:06.000 --> 49:08.000\nDossboot.\n\n49:08.000 --> 49:10.000\nHe doesn't do that.\n\n49:12.000 --> 49:14.000\nHow about...\n\n49:14.000 --> 49:16.000\nCan I give you more sound ideas?\n\n49:20.000 --> 49:22.000\nYou want like a scary haunted house?\n\n49:22.000 --> 49:24.000\nProbably just for...\n\n49:24.000 --> 49:26.000\nJust general purpose haunted house atmosphere.\n\n49:26.000 --> 49:47.000\nThere's a cowboy in there fighting both the Dracula and the ghost.\n\n49:47.000 --> 49:49.000\nGive me...\n\n49:49.000 --> 49:51.000\nIf your Dracula and your ghost start fighting each other,\n\n49:51.000 --> 49:53.000\njust put a cowboy in your haunted house.\n\n49:53.000 --> 49:55.000\nHe'll sort shit out.\n\n49:55.000 --> 50:00.000\nDracula waking up and realizing he needs a shave and shaving.\n\n50:00.000 --> 50:02.000\nSo this is Count Dracula having a morning shave.\n\n50:02.000 --> 50:04.000\nCount Dracula waking up and saying he needs a morning shave.\n\n50:04.000 --> 50:06.000\nYes.\n\n50:08.000 --> 50:10.000\nWell, first of all...\n\n50:12.000 --> 50:15.000\nYou tried to trick Dracula into killing himself.\n\n50:15.000 --> 50:18.000\nRight, but whatever morning means to Count Dracula.\n\n50:18.000 --> 50:20.000\nOkay, it was midnight, I think.\n\n50:20.000 --> 50:22.000\nIt could be the opposite of Cock-a-doodle-doo.\n\n50:22.000 --> 50:24.000\nIt's midnight when the strip is hot.\n\n50:24.000 --> 50:26.000\nThat's when Dracula gets out.\n\n50:30.000 --> 50:32.000\nBlah.\n\n50:36.000 --> 50:38.000\nOh, blah.\n\n50:40.000 --> 50:42.000\nBlah.\n\n50:43.000 --> 50:45.000\nBlah.\n\n50:47.000 --> 50:49.000\nOh, blah.\n\n50:49.000 --> 50:51.000\nBlah, blah.\n\n50:51.000 --> 50:54.000\nThe last part was him going like, I don't have any blood.\n\n50:54.000 --> 50:57.000\nSo I cut myself shaving.

while the chainsaw's going.\n\n53:22.000 --> 53:24.000\nAll right, lawnmower, lawnmower, lawnmower,\n\n53:24.000 --> 53:26.000\nlawnmower, chainsaw, can opener.\n\n53:26.000 --> 53:28.000\nThe helicopter changes gears.\n\n53:28.000 --> 53:30.000\nThe lawnmower is still going,\n\n53:30.000 --> 53:32.000\nbut somebody needs to open a can of peas\n\n53:32.000 --> 53:34.000\nand an electric can opener is there.\n\n53:42.000 --> 53:44.000\nYou hear that?\n\n53:44.000 --> 53:46.000\nThat was the lawnmower was going,\n\n53:46.000 --> 53:48.000\nand then the electric can opener was on top of it.\n\n53:48.000 --> 53:50.000\nWhere's the chopper?\n\n53:55.000 --> 53:57.000\nI mean, the chopper's drowned out by the lawnmower.\n\n53:57.000 --> 53:59.000\nCome on, man.\n\n53:59.000 -->

split it?\n\n54:51.000 --> 54:53.000\nI was going to order the chicken parm, too.\n\n54:53.000 --> 54:56.000\nAnd he's like, all right, we'll split the chicken parmesan,\n\n54:56.000 -->

55:07.000\nand he finishes taking the order.\n\n55:07.000 --> 55:09.000\nIt's a big table full of people.\n\n55:09.000 --> 55:12.000\nDoing a little project with the DeVito clan.\n\n55:12.000 -->

Stiles,\n\n01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:19.000\nChip Esson, we all have our hats,\n\n01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000\nand we're all getting on the same plane together,\n\n01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:22.000\nand Malcolm McDowell's in front of me,\n\n01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000\nand he has his hat too.\n\n01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000\nSo we're all loading in the first class,\n\n01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000\nwe've all got cowboy hats.\n\n01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000\nI must have told the story before.\n\n01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:31.000\nI bet you did, but it's like,\n\n01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:32.000\nI don't know, it's so long ago,\n\n01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:33.000\nI don't remember.\n\n01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000\nIf we both forget, then who cares?\n\n01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000\nYeah, well, let the audience decide.\n\n01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:38.000\nWell, I mean, but they're helpless.\n\n01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:39.000\nThey're hostages.\n\n01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:42.000\nLet them sit there and remember.\n\n01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:45.000\nWhy don't you marry remembering stuff?\n\n01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000\nYou should have took a picture.\n\n01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:48.000\nSo we're getting on the plane,\n\n01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:49.000\nand he's in front of me,\n\n01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000\nI'm number two getting on,\n\n01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:52.000\nand he's got his cowboy hat,\n\n01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:56.000\nand he's just told this poor kid to bone out\n\n01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:00.000\npolitely asking for interaction with Malcolm McDowell,\n\n01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000\nand he didn't dig it.\n\n01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000\nSo he's in front of me,\n\n01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000\nand we're waiting to get on,\n\n01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000\nlike, sit in our seats,\n\n01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:11.000\nand he's in row one, and I'm in row two,\n\n01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:14.000\nand he's putting his hat up in the bin,\n\n01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000\nand I go, oh, I see you've got a hat too.\n\n01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000\nI'm just trying to find a way to talk to him.\n\n01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:21.000\nAnd he goes, oh, yes, yes, I see you've got yours as well.\n\n01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000\nI said, how did you get yours?\n\n01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000\nI said, I'm wearing like skinny jeans\n\n01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:28.000\nand like a motley crew shirt.\n\n01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:31.000\nAnd I said, well, I'm a professional bull rider.\n\n01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:34.000\nAnd he goes, you are?\n\n01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000\nOkay, now I remember.\n\n01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000\nAnd I go, no.\n\n01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000\nAnd he goes, oh, I wish you wouldn't have said that.\n\n01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:43.000\nHe would have been so happy that I was a professional bull rider.\n\n01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:46.000\nHe wanted to eat that Joe Pantoliano steak.\n\n01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.000\nWhat?\n\n01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000\nMatrix, Matrix.\n\n01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000\nOh, wow, you lost me on that one.\n\n01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:52.000\nBut no, I got you.\n\n01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000\nThe steak was more delicious.\n\n01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:55.000\nAnd then we watched him overact\n\n01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000\nwhile he was learning his lines for entourage\n\n01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000\nthe whole flight.\n\n01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:02.000\nI wonder what it takes anecdotally,\n\n01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:07.000\nbecause I think to myself, like, what would it take\n\n01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:13.000\nto ever arrive at a place where someone, you know,\n\n01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:17.000\nacknowledging recognition of you?\n\n01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:20.000\nSomebody being like, hey, look, there's Dan Harmon\n\n01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000\nin Line at Fries, you know?\n\n01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:26.000\nWhich I'm like, what would it take to make that\n\n01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:30.000\nso fucking like that you would be like, no!\n\n01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:33.000\nAnd I know the answer, like, I'm not an actor.\n\n01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:34.000\nHave you ever done that?\n\n01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:35.000\nHave you ever been in a bad mood\n\n01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000\nand somebody walked up and wanted some interaction?\n\n01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:38.000\nNo, never, ever.\n\n01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000\nI mean, I've been, I've only been,\n\n01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000\nI think we've talked about this before.\n\n01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:45.000\nThere's only been like probably two instances\n\n01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:48.000\nin my entire life of anyone ever talking to me,\n\n01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:52.000\nlike, in that context.\n\n01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:55.000\nAnd it was only, it was, the person was,\n\n01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:56.000\nlook, I'll be honest with you,\n\n01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:59.000\nI'm not a huge fan of the fucking autographed guys\n\n01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000\nthat sometimes like come out here,\n\n01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:02.000\nand I'm sorry if you're in the audience,\n\n01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:03.000\nbecause if you are, then I misjudge you,\n\n01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:04.000\nbecause part of why I don't like them\n\n01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000\nis I don't even think they come into the fucking show.\n\n01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:09.000\nI think they, and I don't think they really give a fuck,\n\n01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:14.000\nand they like, they strike this tone of like,\n\n01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:17.000\nthat's based on the shared culture we all have,\n\n01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000\nwhich is you should be grateful for somebody\n\n01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000\nto want your autograph, which you should.\n\n01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:26.000\nBut like, they build on that mythology\n\n01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:29.000\nand use the same, and go like,\n\n01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000\nat festivals and stuff, there's people,\n\n01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000\nthey don't know who you are,\n\n01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000\nthey just like, they get like some heads up\n\n01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000\nabout who you are, like they're just there\n\n01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:40.000\nto like collect these piles of fucking signatures,\n\n01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:43.000\nthey don't give a shit, and then that's fine too.\n\n01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:46.000\nBut like, the way that they try to,\n\n01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000\nthey play into your guilt, like they go like,\n\n01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000\ncome on man, come on man, I've been out here all day,\n\n01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:55.000\nlike they say shit that like, is so inverse to like,\n\n01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:59.000\ncome on man, fuck you, you can't high road me,\n\n01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:04.000\nand like, that's it, it's people that are disingenuous.\n\n01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:08.000\nNobody that's like hat in hand,\n\n01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:12.000\nand I told the story of that guy at the billiards place\n\n01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000\nthat like, did everything wrong,\n\n01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000\nbut I still wasn't mean to him ever,\n\n01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:19.000\nI just like made fun of him on the show like later,\n\n01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000\nbecause he didn't really know who I was,\n\n01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:24.000\nhe thought I was Justin and he didn't like whatever,\n\n01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:27.000\nbut it's still, I'm just, I truly curious,\n\n01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:30.000\nlike cause I'm sure the answer is like really wonderful,\n\n01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:33.000\nlike what is it that happens to the Barbara Streisand's\n\n01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000\nof the world, the Malcolm McDowell's like,\n\n01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:38.000\nwhat stories do they have about people just like,\n\n01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:41.000\nlike just, there must be horrible things\n\n01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:44.000\nthat have happened to them because they allow it.\n\n01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:47.000\nSomebody I know went up to like George Harrison\n\n01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:50.000\nat the airport, LAX, and he was eating breakfast,\n\n01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000\nand he walked up to Mr. Harrison, can I get an autograph?\n\n01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:55.000\nAnd he goes, no, like I'm fucking having breakfast,\n\n01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:58.000\nlike you don't get to walk up and interrupt everything.\n\n01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000\nBy the way, I have three co-workers,\n\n01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:04.000\nand one of them got shot doing this.\n\n01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000\nEating breakfast, yeah.\n\n01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:11.000\nLike 25% of the people that do what I do die this way.\n\n01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000\nYou're not catching me stoked ever.\n\n01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:16.000\nSpencer, do you get, how much do you get rumbled\n\n01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000\nfor being Spencer walking down the road?\n\n01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000\nNot really, pretty rarely.\n\n01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:23.000\nIs it comfortable or uncomfortable for you?\n\n01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000\nI'm fine with it.\n\n01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:26.000\nIt's great.\n\n01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:27.000\nYou know, the thing about pictures,\n\n01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000\nI always tell people who are awkward,\n\n01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000\nlike the thing about pictures and autographs\n\n01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000\nis they really frame the interaction.\n\n01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:36.000\nYou know what they want, you know when they have it,\n\n01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:39.000\nand they know that they can now leave satisfied.\n\n01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000\nWhereas if they don't ask for that,\n\n01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:44.000\nthey kind of just like orbit and say things like,\n\n01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000\nI'm so nervous, I don't know what to say,\n\n01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:47.000\nyou probably think I'm a loser.\n\n01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:50.000\nWell, you're not giving me a lot of other options.\n\n01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:58.000\nLike I guess I do, okay.\n\n01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:01.000\nBut I mean, and it's fine to talk to people too,\n\n01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000\nbut it's just like, but when you ask for an autograph,\n\n01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:06.000\nit's like, yeah, then you can shoot the shit or something,\n\n01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000\nbut then they're like, oh yeah, now I have my autograph,\n\n01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:11.000\nI'm good to go, and so that's always great.\n\n01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:15.000\nBut it's very rare for, I don't know, for people,\n\n01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000\nsometimes people just want to ask a lot of questions,\n\n01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:20.000\nand it seems like they're just searching for questions to ask,\n\n01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000\nand that's not always the best, but even that's not bad.\n\n01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:25.000\nThe worst time I had was like this really drunk guy,\n\n01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000\nI want to say in Chicago or something,\n\n01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000\nthat was like no joke wanting me to like get in\n\n01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000\non his business opportunity,\n\n01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000\nlike wanting me to buy a time share or some shit.\n\n01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000\nIt's like, I don't want any of this,\n\n01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000\nand there's other people that want to talk to me too,\n\n01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:38.000\nand I want to talk to them,\n\n01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:41.000\nand I don't want to buy your time share or whatever, you know.\n\n01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:44.000\nThat was the worst, but it's always really great.\n\n01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:47.000\nI worked with this guy who said,\n\n01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:50.000\nI don't know, it was like one of these Beatle guys.\n\n01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:53.000\nHe worked with one of these Beatle guys in Britain,\n\n01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:56.000\nand he was drawing a little doodle.\n\n01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:59.000\nSorry, when you say Beatle guys,\n\n01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000\nare we talking about Ringo Starr, what's going on here?\n\n01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000\nYeah, it might have been George Harrison, I don't know.\n\n01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000\nIt's one of these Beatle guys, right?\n\n01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:09.000\nYou don't know, you worked with one of them?\n\n01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:12.000\nNo, I worked with a guy who worked with a Beatle guy.\n\n01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:15.000\nOh, so a Beatle guy, yeah, okay.\n\n01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:18.000\nI would have remembered if I worked with a Beatle guy.\n\n01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000\nIt would have been your job to remember, yeah.\n\n01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:21.000\nRight, exactly.\n\n01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:24.000\nBut he was like drawing a picture,\n\n01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:27.000\nand then he put it down,\n\n01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:30.000\nand then one of his assistants came and took the picture\n\n01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:33.000\nand put it into a folder and whisked it away,\n\n01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000\nand he was like, why did that just happen?\n\n01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:40.000\nHe was like, well, these people stole my lyrics out of my car,\n\n01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:43.000\nand they're in a museum, and they won't give them back now.\n\n01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000\nSo now I have this guy, and he takes all the stuff I touch,\n\n01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:48.000\nand he photocopies it and keeps it away from people.\n\n01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:51.000\nAnd that's like a level of fame where you probably are,\n\n01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:54.000\njust like, I mean, your whole worldview must be upside down\n\n01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000\njust because it's like people will just fuck with your shit.\n\n01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000\nThat was Paul McCartney for sure.\n\n01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:01.000\nOh, it might have been Paul McCartney, yeah.\n\n01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:04.000\nI told this story when I was at South by,\n\n01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:07.000\nand I was on the same flight as Padgett Brewster,\n\n01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:12.000\nand there were people waiting outside the airport for her,\n\n01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:15.000\nwhich was a different level.\n\n01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000\nIt was like not just waiting outside the airport\n\n01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000\nbecause there's celebrities coming around because it's South by,\n\n01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:23.000\nbut they had shit that was Padgett Brewster related.\n\n01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000\nBut then there were also people that were like,\n\n01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000\nno, they had a bunch of blank pieces of paper,\n\n01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:30.000\nphoto paper, like glossy paper, which by the fucking,\n\n01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:35.000\nugh, when you sign photo paper, it's like nails on chalkboard.\n\n01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:39.000\nIt's like that squeaky freak, I don't know.\n\n01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:42.000\nWe'll talk about unrelatable harm and what the fuck.\n\n01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000\nBecause I remember somebody was like,\n\n01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000\noh, you too, can I get you,\n\n01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:49.000\nit was just like throwing me a bone because there's just blank things.\n\n01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000\nAnd then I walked into the airport,\n\n01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:54.000\nand they acted like they thought I was famous because I was with you,\n\n01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:57.000\nand she's like, yeah, but you know what?\n\n01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:01.000\nThose people, they make me sign those blank pieces of photo paper,\n\n01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:04.000\nand then they print fake nudes on them.\n\n01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:08.000\nAnd then a fake nude signed by Padgett, what?\n\n01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:12.000\nThat just blows my, that's almost too hilarious to be abused,\n\n01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:16.000\nbecause it's just like, oh, look, I mean, it's like, what?\n\n01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000\nYou're selling that?\n\n01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:21.000\nLook, she signed, is it like a troll thing?\n\n01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:24.000\nIt sounds like probably the intent is like she did it\n\n01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:27.000\nfor someone she was intimate with and it's like stolen.\n\n01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000\nIt's like, oh, this is a real thing.\n\n01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000\nShe sent a boyfriend or something.\n\n01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:34.000\nShe also did say that,\n\n01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:38.000\nshe said she tends to get pulled aside at TSA checkpoints\n\n01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:43.000\nbecause she was on this criminal minds show or whatever.\n\n01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000\nCreated by me.\n\n01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:51.000\nThe TSA people are really into these certain mainstream crime dramas,\n\n01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000\nand they always recognize her,\n\n01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:57.000\nand she said an inordinate that they'll pat her down.\n\n01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:01.000\nYeah, and it's like, they're not, I don't think, I mean,\n\n01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000\nI don't think she would want me to say,\n\n01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:06.000\nimply that they're doing it so that they can touch her.\n\n01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:09.000\nIt's more like they want to take her aside\n\n01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:12.000\nand then tell her they're a big fan.\n\n01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:16.000\nThey're not going down the giving of the full business of Padgett.\n\n01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:19.000\nI think it's kind of like, yeah, special check your bag thing,\n\n01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:22.000\nand then it's like, by the way, can I get a selfie?\n\n01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:27.000\nBecause I would hate to imply in this climate,\n\n01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:30.000\nwe need to take that shit seriously, this idea of,\n\n01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000\nthat wasn't part of the idea,\n\n01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:35.000\nwas that they were doing it to grope.\n\n01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:38.000\nBut it's still fucking crazy, the idea that they're like,\n\n01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000\noh yeah, random spot check.\n\n01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000\nI think your bag smells like explosives,\n\n01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000\nso can you come over here?\n\n01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:47.000\nBy the way, big fan cha-ching!\n\n01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:50.000\nI mean, you expect more from the TSA.\n\n01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000\nSpencer, I'm going to come over there and grab\n\n01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000\nsome character sheets.\n\n01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000\nDid I fill the time?\n\n01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000\nThis is why I got to become a musician,\n\n01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000\nbecause when I moved to L.A.,\n\n01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000\nI was like, hey, let's go see Harry Dean Stanton\n\n01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000\nat this hotel lounge,\n\n01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:09.000\nor you go see Jeff Goldblum play piano.\n\n01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:12.000\nIt was part of the L.A. culture.\n\n01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:16.000\nI either got to stop doing this show,\n\n01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:19.000\nor I got to learn the clarinet or something.\n\n01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:22.000\nBecause it's like, dumb otherwise.\n\n01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000\nI'm tired of it.\n\n01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000\nWhat am I supposed to tell you about?\n\n01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000\nI can't tell you anything about my new house,\n\n01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000\nbecause then you can come and shoot me.\n\n01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000\nI can't tell you I'm afraid you'll shoot me,\n\n01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000\nbecause then that's alienating.\n\n01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000\nOh, please shoot me.\n\n01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:39.000\nOh, what a cool guy wishes he was shot.\n\n01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000\nThere's no reward in it.\n\n01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000\nI'm not being provocative or being a dick\n\n01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000\nby asking this question,\n\n01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000\nbut have you fired your gun and used it\n\n01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000\nto change your...\n\n01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000\nNo, my actual gun, no.\n\n01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000\nI'm afraid to fire it because the first thing I did\n\n01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000\nwhen I bought it is take it apart and clean it\n\n01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000\nand put it back together.\n\n01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000\nSo now it's a gun that's been assembled\n\n01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000\nby a fucking idiot.\n\n01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000\nIt should just have a sticker on it\n\n01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000\nthat says, like, a fucking liberal\n\n01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000\nthat got scared because Trump got elected,\n\n01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000\nput this together.\n\n01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000\nDon't ever pull the trigger.\n\n01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000\nIt's going to blow up in your hands.\n\n01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000\nThat's why I want to get a revolver.\n\n01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000\nYeah, because that's the thing I couldn't wait to do.\n\n01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000\nI mean, I was like...\n\n01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000\nI always wanted to, like, take a gun apart.\n\n01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000\nSo I did.\n\n01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000\nNow it's a bomb.\n\n01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000\nAnd then I, like, put it back together.\n\n01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000\nI'm like, well, that doesn't seem like it should be rattling.\n\n01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000\nI guess they rattle in the movies,\n\n01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000\nbut I always thought that was, like, overindulgent\n\n01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000\nFoley artists, you know?\n\n01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000\nLike, every time John McClain, like, goes like this,\n\n01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000\nthe gun goes like...\n\n01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000\nI just always thought that was, like, audio guys\n\n01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000\nbeing like, oh, man, fucking, like, clinkity, clink, clink.\n\n01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000\nGive me more clinks on that.\n\n01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000\nBut it's like, no, those things really\n\n01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000\nkind of rattle in your hand, which\n\n01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000\nit just makes me feel like it's going to blow up\n\n01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000\nwhen I shoot it.\n\n01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000\nGenuinely terrified. Which is good, though,\n\n01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000\nbecause I told the story of the guy in my porch\n\n01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000\nand, like, you know, and Spencer's talked about how\n\n01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000\nthey do studies where you touch one of these things\n\n01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000\nand your testosterone goes up\n\n01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000\nand, like, the danger of having one of these things.\n\n01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000\nIt's like, it's good to think\n\n01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000\nthat it will explode if I fire it.\n\n01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000\nLike, that's better than...\n\n01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000\nThat second best to not owning a gun\n\n01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000\nis being so afraid to fire it\n\n01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000\nthat, because you think you probably\n\n01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000\nkill yourself.\n\n01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000\nYou know, you can blow up your hand\n\n01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000\nalong with the intruder.\n\n01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000\nYeah. Unless you're trying to kill yourself\n\n01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000\nwith a gun, then it's, like, about the same.\n\n01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000\nThat would be amazing if you got the gun\n\n01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000\nand then you're like, I'm going to blow my brains out\n\n01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000\nand then it, like, goes...\n\n01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000\nIt just takes your hand off.\n\n01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000\nYeah.

by\n\n01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000\nkind of near your neighborhood\n\n01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000\nwhere it seemed like some,\n\n01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000\nI don't know, some plain clothes cops\n\n01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000\nwho just looked like guys with guns\n\n01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000\nin their waistband, like,\n\n01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000\nwere accosting this dude in a

01:19:13.000\nbecause the cops didn't identify themselves as cops.\n\n01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000\nAnd so I was like, I don't know what to do\n\n01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000\nand I called 3-1-1 and I didn't go anywhere\n\n01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000\nand then I called 9-1-1 and it was just like\n\n01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000\njammed, the lines were jammed,\n\n01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000\nlike I couldn't get through and I'm like,\n\n01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000\nit's a good thing this isn't an emergency happening to me.\n\n01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000\nI'd be out of

cancelling.\n\n01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000\nSure.\n\n01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000\nWhen are you ever in the mood to have coffee\n\n01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000\nand talk about what should happen when you die\n\n01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000\nwith all your money?\n\n01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000\nI'm just always like, oh, is that at noon today?\n\n01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000\nYeah.\n\n01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000\nI'm folding my socks.\n\n01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000\nI kind of feel like that would be a fun meeting to have.\n\n01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000\nYeah.\n\n01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000\nI keep a note\n\n01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000\nin my iPhone updated.\n\n01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000\nWell, you take mine.\n\n01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000\nBecause here's what I want to tell the person.\n\n01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000\nBecause I told Cody,\n\n01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000\nwe're getting a house together.\n\n01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000\nI definitely, here's a nightmare scenario.\n\n01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000\nSomething God forbid happens to me.\n\n01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000\nLet's just call it hit by a bus\n\n01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000\neven though we know that bus is going to be\n\n01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000\ncholesterol.\n\n01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000\nBut\n\n01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000\nlet's just say it's like\n\n01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000\nsudden and unexpected\n\n01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000\nand it's just done.\n\n01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000\nThe idea of\n\n01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000\nloving Cody, moving the house together.\n\n01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000\nWe're not married yet.\n\n01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000\nAnd she's just living in this house\n\n01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000\nthat she's not\n\n01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000\nshe chose it with me\n\n01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000\nbut she's not\n\n01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000\nshe doesn't have a claim to it if I die\n\n01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000\nand then\n\n01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000\nall of a sudden some horrendous\n\n01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000\nrelative from Wisconsin\n\n01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000\nwho knows.\n\n01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000\nLike shit town.\n\n01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000\nYeah.\n\n01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000\nI don't know how that shit works.\n\n01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000\nSo anyway,\n\n01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000\nthere's a nightmare scenario to be avoided\n\n01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000\nand Cody and I are aware of it.\n\n01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000\nBut then I'm like\n\n01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000\nanother problem if you're like\n\n01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000\ndriving with Cody and I'm

here\n\n01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000\nso that you're not incentivized to kill me.\n\n01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000\nLike\n\n01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000\nand she's like\n\n01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000\nI'm not going to kill you.\n\n01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000\nThat's what she'd say if she was going to kill you.\n\n01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000\nThat's what you'd say if you were going to kill me.\n\n01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000\nAnd I'm like look,\n\n01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000\nhere's what I'm going to do.\n\n01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000\nWhen I plan my estate\n\n01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000\nI'm going to have no matter how\n\n01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000\nunmisterious my death is\n\n01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000\nlike\n\n01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000\nlet's say I'm

01:21:41.000\nit says like what are they worth.net\n\n01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000\nor whatever it's for\n\n01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000\nit says I'm worth 5 million.\n\n01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000\nI don't know what that means.\n\n01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000\nBut\n\n01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000\nlet's say that's what I'm worth\n\n01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000\nand

time runs out\n\n01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000\nis that we just go through\n\n01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000\nwhere you've set us with a new D&D\n\n01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000\n5th edition set up here.\n\n01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000\nThe thing is\n\n01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000\nin 5th edition your character sheet\n\n01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000\nhas a little spot for\n\n01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000\npersonality traits,\n\n01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000\nbonds and flaws.\n\n01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000\nMaybe we should work those out.\n\n01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000\nI know that'll be exciting for the audience\n\n01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000\nbut it's helpful\n\n01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000\nand it might help you\n\n01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000\nget some...\n\n01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000\nGet some.\n\n01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000\nD&D is all about getting some.\n\n01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000\nPersonality traits.\n\n01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000\nDid you guys remember\n\n01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000\nwell obviously Jeff remembers he likes fire.\n\n01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000\nDo you guys remember your characters at all?\n\n01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000\nDiarrhea Jr.\n\n01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000\nDiarrhea, you're into...\n\n01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000\nWe know you love horses for some\n\n01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000\nstrange reasons.\n\n01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000\nI know my character.\n\n01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000\nAlright.\n\n01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000\nWell then it should be easy to pick a personality\n\n01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000\ntrait or two.\n\n01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000\nHow does that help us throughout the gameplay?\n\n01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000\nBecause then you know that's\n\n01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000\nkind of a part of your character.\n\n01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000\nI would say lately Chad\n\n01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000\nhas been like he's trying to\n\n01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000\nkick the bee's nest or something.\n\n01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000\nThat's just kind of who he is.\n\n01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000\nSo if you write that on your character\n\n01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000\nand then you look at it, be like,\n\n01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000\nah that's who I am.\n\n01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000\nSo this box on the right\n\n01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000\nare the traits?\n\n01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000\nAnd I get to pick two of those.\n\n01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000\nThe top right, one or two, yeah.\n\n01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000\nWe could do this later I guess.\n\n01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000\nOh, I could write in anything myself?\n\n01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000\nYeah, that's the idea is that\n\n01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000\nwe'll kind of reacquaint you guys with your characters\n\n01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000\nnow that they're new in fifth edition.\n\n01:31:47.000 -->

Yeah, I mean,\n\n01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000\nthe ghosts of your past\n\n01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000\nmight come back, but I don't\n\n01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000\nthink you care about it too much, because\n\n01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000\nit's been... You've spent a lot of time\n\n01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000\ncommitting to farming. Okay, we fucking...\n\n01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000\nWe suck. We're terrible at this.\n\n01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000\nThink about it like the fifth Tomb Raider\n\n01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000\nmovie.\n\n01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000\nThere is one. It's not called Tomb Raider 5.\n\n01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000\nThey don't want you to watch the first four.\n\n01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000\nIs there going to be some shit in the first four?\n\n01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000\nMaybe if you're a huge Tomb Raider\n\n01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000\nmovie fan, you're like, oh...\n\n01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000\nWe're not answering any questions from the previous\n\n01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000\nTomb Raider. We're just writing another\n\n01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000\ntomb. More or less. Okay.\n\n01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000\nThere were some big unanswered questions, though.\n\n01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000\nOne of the first villains\n\n01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000\nwe fought was going to be\n\n01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000\nprobably a big bad...\n\n01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000\nThey destroyed the church basement.\n\n01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000\nI forgot about that. They were eating cows and stuff like that.\n\n01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000\nThen there was a Ho-Oh kind of\n\n01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.000\nflying in the air.\n\n01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000\nBig evil demon. Yeah.\n\n01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000\nMan, that was great, huh?\n\n01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000\nThere was a lot of setup happening.\n\n01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000\nWe spent our whole time just beating up a family\n\n01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000\nthat had\n\n01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.000\nnothing to do with anything. It was cool, though.\n\n01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000\nI like it. Yeah.\n\n01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000\nAnyway, sorry about all that.\n\n01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000\nNo, no, it's good. Hopefully.\n\n01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000\nWe start afresh. It's going to be\n\n01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000\nsome serious D&D. We have new character sheets.\n\n01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000\nI'm very excited about that. I like that on my extra\n\n01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000\nnotes. It just says, eat my ass\n\n01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000\nexclamation point. Yeah, you... I didn't write\n\n01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000\nthat. You wrote that. I guess I did.\n\n01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000\nI don't know why. Okay, so let's talk about\n\n01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000\ngroup inventory, Spencer. Group inventory.\n\n01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000\nSo one of the things I\n\n01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000\nfigured out was that... Well, I used to give\n\n01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000\nSteve the group inventory sheet because\n\n01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000\nI thought he was the most responsible, but then I was\n\n01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000\nlike, well, no, everyone should have the group\n\n01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000\ninventory sheet, and then they'll know what they\n\n01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000\nall have on them. So it's like your collected wealth.\n\n01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000\nAnd then the idea was you\n\n01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000\nwanted to become farmers. So if you ever wanted\n\n01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000\nto sell your stuff to buy farm\n\n01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000\nequipment, it would be helpful\n\n01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000\nto know all\n\n01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000\nthe stuff that you could sell and all the wealth you had\n\n01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000\nbecause it's not on your character sheet.\n\n01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000\nSo where is that on this? I don't see farmer\n\n01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000\nequipment. You don't have any. Okay.\n\n01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000\nWe're grass roots.\n\n01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000\nI mean, you might have a couple shovels and stuff,\n\n01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000\nbut you haven't really bought a lot of farm equipment.\n\n01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000\nI think you just bought some potato seeds.\n\n01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000\nSo under group's own gear, you have a little\n\n01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000\nbracket here. We have a\n\n01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000\nbow.\n\n01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000\nYeah, that's your own stuff. That's like stuff\n\n01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000\nif you wanted... If you, for instance, wanted to\n\n01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000\ncommit to farming so hard, you sold all your\n\n01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000\nweapons and armor. That stuff's on your group\n\n01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000\ninventory sheet, and it has like monetary\n\n01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000\nvalue. Like you could sell your bow for too gold.\n\n01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000\nI dig it. Okay. What are the relics? Are these\n\n01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.000\nimportant anymore? They're just items\n\n01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000\nyou have. I mean, I don't...\n\n01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000\nThe relics are relics. You never discovered\n\n01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000\nwhat they were. They were just something you picked\n\n01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000\nup and forgot about because it was on Steve's\n\n01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000\ngroup inventory. We have a hundred pounds\n\n01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000\nof beef jerky. Yeah, it was in a bag of...\n\n01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000\nDoes that expire? No, it's beef jerky.\n\n01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000\nNo, it's dried for a reason. I don't know.\n\n01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000\nI've had some gross\n\n01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000\nold beef jerky. I've had some moldy beef\n\n01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000\njerky. Oh, don't bring it up.\n\n01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000\nIt's a sensitive, sensitive\n\n01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000\nspot for this audience.\n\n01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000\nThere's beef...\n\n01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000\nGood times. Beef fungus.\n\n01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000\nOh man, remember that. Yeah.\n\n01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000\nClassic. If he's listening, he's going to blow his brains\n\n01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000\nout. That could be\n\n01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000\nfunny. No, that\n\n01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000\nwould not be funny.\n\n01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000\nHello, William. We love you. Yeah, yeah.\n\n01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000\nBag of\n\n01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000\nholding. Yeah, bag of...\n\n01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000\nYou stole it from that guy who is the mayor\n\n01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000\nof Fightsville. One poison\n\n01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000\npill. Yep, you stole that off of\n\n01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000\nAssassin. That was the Assassin\n\n01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000\nwho took Patchen's gem. He didn't\n\n01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000\ntake it. A different one did. Black\n\n01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000\nDragon shards. That was also on the Assassin.\n\n01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000\nYou didn't know what that did. Right.\n\n01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000\nBut you could find out.\n\n01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.000\nTwo Masterwork daggers.\n\n01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000\nThose are more expensive than regular daggers.\n\n01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000\nThose are also owned by the Assassins. Okay.\n\n01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000\nSo these are all like company\n\n01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000\nstuff we all have together.\n\n01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000\nYeah, it's treasure you found, but didn't decide\n\n01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000\nto split up amongst yourself. And physically\n\n01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000\nhow are we toting all this about with our 100\n\n01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000\npounds of beef jerky? It's in your closet, in your\n\n01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000\nfarm. Okay. So we have a home base.\n\n01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000\nOh, but the beef jerky is in a magical bag\n\n01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000\nof holding. It doesn't... You don't have to...\n\n01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000\nOh, could this all be in the bag of holding? Sure,\n\n01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000\nyeah. All right. So we have all\n\n01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000\nthis. So we have\n\n01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000\n18 gold pieces, including something else.\n\n01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000\nThis is the real D&D, man.\n\n01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000\nNot all this fucking like\n\n01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000\nthese and vows. Yeah. It's just pretty\n\n01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000\nwhat's in my bag. It's just\n\n01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000\njust inventory, man. Yeah.

Six right now until you level up.\n\n01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000\nYeah. Okay. So we have six and then we get to pick\n\n01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000\nhow many more?
