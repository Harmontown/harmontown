00:00.000 --> 00:22.000
I love this theater. It's so cool to walk out. I wish you could all stand up here and look at how good Ruby this is. Thank you all for being here.

00:22.000 --> 00:37.000
From the heart of Los Angeles, MacArthur Park, where the icing is melting off the cake for no reason, Harmontown is now in session. Please welcome your Game Master, Spencer Crittenden.

00:37.000 --> 00:53.000
Hello Spencer. Hey man. Is your mic good? I don't know. Yeah, you're there.

00:53.000 --> 01:20.000
Let's sing along. How's your mic? It's good. It's better than a mic should be. Keep going. I got it for free. There's free on the chairs over there. Let's bring out the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon. Yeah.

01:23.000 --> 01:46.000
Thank you. Thank you, Dan. Yeah. It's a mic check song where we sing into our mics. What kind of booty does your mama like? She likes it long and wide. I heard she likes it inside.

01:46.000 --> 02:01.000
Damn, the poopiest rim. Lucky him.

02:01.000 --> 02:22.000
Everyone that your mama meets is a potential ill treat for her insatiable appetite for booty delight. Damn, I remember the time when your mama ate booty with a squeeze of lime.

02:22.000 --> 02:46.000
Not a lot that rhymes with time except for his squeeze of lime. It's a blime. I mean, yeah, I know there's other words. It's a grime. Oh, really? Damn.

02:46.000 --> 03:04.000
I remember going to your mama's house. I got D Laos afterwards by the fire department because her apartment is infested with scabies. Okay.

03:04.000 --> 03:24.000
Or rabies. Making babies. There's an Indian dessert called Jalebi's. All right. Welcome, everybody. Thank you for coming. We did it. We fucking did it again. You came here for entertainment and guess what? You got, you got.

03:24.000 --> 03:34.000
You're already ahead. The show could be over right now. We could bring the curtain down. What is $10 kitschy anywhere else? Huh? Like a Snickers bar and maybe like a half an Avengers movie?

03:34.000 --> 03:45.000
Three quarters of a cracker. What are you going to watch the Hulk not turn into the Hulk, huh? Come on. Does the Hulk not turn into the Hulk? That's what I heard. I don't know. Spoilers. I haven't seen it.

03:45.000 --> 04:01.000
How does he not be a Hulk? Jeff, do you notice anything different about me? A certain glow perhaps? Oh, you're pregnant. Close. You are looking at a man in escrow.

04:01.000 --> 04:20.000
You're going to get birth to a house. You actually, you made the deal. You might get the house. Put an offer on a house that offer was accepted. Escrow was negotiated. I guess that's a thing, like the length of the escrow. You kind of negotiate that too.

04:20.000 --> 04:34.000
It's not the length of the escrow that matters, Dan. It's the motion of the ocean. Yeah, so we agreed on it and I doc you signed a thing and we're off. I think I'll have a house in 30 days.

04:34.000 --> 04:41.000
What will make this new house better than your current house? It's giant. It's bigger.

04:41.000 --> 04:59.000
How do you utilize that space? Are you going to just be running around or having... Well, Cody and I went through it the other day and we did realize that, because initially we had this plan, like Cody and I were going to go, okay, we're going to have a master bedroom,

04:59.000 --> 05:16.000
but then we're going to each have our own bedroom, because we like the psychological health of, like, hey, if we're together, we choose to be together.

05:16.000 --> 05:29.000
Cody still has her apartment and she's been sleeping at my place so regularly that you could almost call it living with me, but I think there's an important thing there for her, maybe for me too, where it's like, hey, you can't take this person for granted.

05:29.000 --> 05:42.000
They got their own apartment. They don't need to be here. Getting in little squabbles and the repairing is maybe easier, thinking like, hey, no one's a hostage here.

05:42.000 --> 05:48.000
Yeah, and so when you want to be romantic and connect, you can go back into the main sanctum.

05:48.000 --> 05:57.000
Right, and that I think is the more important thing is what it does. It's not about like, oh, let's prepare to be squabbling and then people are actually going to sleep in these other rooms.

05:57.000 --> 06:12.000
It probably never happened, but psychologically what that transforms your master bedroom into, which is like, it's like a hotel suite. This is not a place for Dan to have his USB cables all over the place and stuff.

06:12.000 --> 06:25.000
So when we were shopping for a house, we had a certain bedroom count, and it was kind of ridiculous because it included two bedrooms, a master bedroom, and then in addition to that, we want a guest room,

06:25.000 --> 06:31.000
and there's other shit that we want. And so I was like, God damn, you need that many bedrooms? Okay.

06:31.000 --> 06:41.000
And we found a place that has that many, but the master bedroom is so, it's got these gigantic walk-in closets. They're like his and hers walk-in closets.

06:41.000 --> 06:49.000
Like, you could put a bed in my closet. So I'm not going to put a bed in my closet, but at the same time, I feel like I could be such a pig in that closet.

06:49.000 --> 06:55.000
Like Cody says, as long as there are your shits behind that door, I'm never going to be like...

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
What do you mean precisely? What would be pig-ish behind his closet door?

06:58.000 --> 07:08.000
My half of my current bedroom... Cody's kind of a neat freak. My half of my current bedroom looks like a 10-year-old boy's bedroom.

07:08.000 --> 07:20.000
Like, I just drop clothes where I take them off so I can put them on tomorrow, and then I'll get an electronic thing from Amazon, and I'll open it up, and the boxes are all over the place,

07:20.000 --> 07:28.000
and there's cables running everywhere, and I got a USB hub where an alarm clock goes, and there's cords coming out.

07:28.000 --> 07:37.000
Is there a sexy scenario where, if you have the master bedroom, where that is the let's be together because we love each other and we're going to smooch,

07:37.000 --> 07:41.000
but we also have our separate rooms where we're doing our own thing.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
Wait, when the master...

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
But we're not going to do that anymore.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
No.

07:46.000 --> 07:51.000
We decided, we got these giant walking closets, like, we don't need...

07:51.000 --> 07:57.000
The upshot of it is that we're walking around the house, and we're like, okay, so this is where the tavern's going to go.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
This is where the...

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
The tavern?

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
Yeah, I got a tavern in my house now.

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
Okay, so you're going to recreate another tavern where you have a...

08:04.000 --> 08:08.000
You lose shit by moving, like, I got a tavern and I got a theater.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
I mean, you have a place to...

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
It's not a real theater, you don't have to freak out.

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
Or sneeze or whatever you did.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
He didn't freak out, he just went...

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
He sneezed or something, he's got a luxury allergy, I get it.

08:24.000 --> 08:29.000
I had a hard time, my immune system started to shut down too when I realized how fucking rich I was.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
So now, you're going to have...

08:31.000 --> 08:37.000
Now you're going to have one master bedroom and not two separate sanctums.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
It'll be one main sanctum.

08:39.000 --> 08:44.000
And is Cody or you going to have the other bedroom when you guys are not, like...

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
We each get...

08:46.000 --> 08:53.000
Cody and I each have two bedrooms to choose from.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
To play with.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
Right.

08:55.000 --> 09:01.000
So we could make one of those... I could make one in my bedroom, I could put a bed in it.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
I'm not going to do that.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
I'm going to put a green screen in it or something.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
I'm going to put a sound booth in there.

09:07.000 --> 09:11.000
I'm going to be like, she seems to have an invisible touch.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
I'm going to make a panic room.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
I just panicked when you wanted to fill Collins' rooms.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
Here's the thing I'm really going to do.

09:22.000 --> 09:29.000
There's this rather large closet that doesn't necessarily...

09:29.000 --> 09:33.000
The layout of the house doesn't indicate that there should be anything there.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
There was this one house we saw.

09:36.000 --> 09:40.000
It was a really nice house hunting adventure because we looked at some places where I was like,

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
this place is fucking rad.

09:43.000 --> 09:48.000
And then you got to think, does rad mean you want to live here?

09:48.000 --> 09:54.000
It's hard to... You're looking at a house and you're like, I always picture myself in these places

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
and that it's always ironic.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
And then I'm like, do the ironic thing.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
Live for your biopic.

10:02.000 --> 10:07.000
Have this third act begin and it says 10 years later and it's like,

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
fade in on some shit that makes your mom sick.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
It just makes people shake their head in Wisconsin and go,

10:15.000 --> 10:20.000
god damn, this motherfucker lives in a giant concrete block with fucking nude sculptures

10:20.000 --> 10:24.000
overlooking a fucking Malibu infinity pool

10:24.000 --> 10:28.000
and he's a fucking barbecue shaped like a pretzel

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
because Tim Burton designed it or something.

10:32.000 --> 10:37.000
I looked at a place that had a turntable garage.

10:39.000 --> 10:44.000
You just put your Prius on there and just fucking rotisserie it for your Coke parties

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
and just check out my fucking Prius, man.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
It's just like moving around in a circle.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
What? Why?

10:50.000 --> 10:54.000
I think that was built originally for a chit-choo train.

10:54.000 --> 10:58.000
The alleged purpose would be that you pull into the garage head first,

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
you don't have to back in and then turn it around.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
That's fucking crazy.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
I mean, it's rad.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
But it's not home, you know?

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
The place that we looked at was rad.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
I think that was Christian Slater who said that.

11:11.000 --> 11:15.000
The walls looked like a place that you would build in No Man's Sky.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
It was out of wood.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
If you've ever played No Man's Sky and you've made a shelter out of wood,

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
that's what the outside of this game looks like.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
You've lost the whole crowd now.

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
You're talking about video games and buying a giant mansion right now.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
I'm trying to get back.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
I know I lost them on the mansion.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
I'm getting them back with the fucking video game thing.

11:32.000 --> 11:36.000
How big does your house need to be for you to be comfortable?

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
Is size the important thing here?

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
You're just you and Cody.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
How big does the house need to be?

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
Size is important to me.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
Sorry, I'm picking peanuts out of my teeth.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
You also went a little lift gal right there.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
Size is important.

11:51.000 --> 11:55.000
You need room for a hairy to go where there are hundreds.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
Get out.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
Size is important to me.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
I want floor space and elbow room.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
Whatever. I got it.

12:03.000 --> 12:11.000
There was this one place that we looked at, the rad place that was not home.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
I would feel fat living here.

12:13.000 --> 12:19.000
This is a place for a person that is on display or something.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
It's an interesting radical house.

12:21.000 --> 12:27.000
When you went down the stairs, there was a bookshelf at the bottom of the stairs.

12:27.000 --> 12:31.000
And then the bookshelf was a secret door.

12:31.000 --> 12:35.000
For a little chamber.

12:35.000 --> 12:41.000
They said a panic room, but if I'm panicked, I'm not going down half of the stairs.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
It's not a panic room.

12:43.000 --> 12:47.000
Where would you go if you were panicked?

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
I'll get on that later.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
But I got inspired by it.

12:51.000 --> 12:57.000
I'm like, that's the only thing that I want in the house that I want.

12:57.000 --> 13:03.000
I'm going to have a contractor make a bookcase door on this big closet.

13:03.000 --> 13:07.000
And I'm going to put all of the monitors in there for all of the security cameras.

13:07.000 --> 13:11.000
So that if I'm having a party, I can be like Alfred, mind the guests.

13:11.000 --> 13:15.000
And then I go down and I look two ways.

13:15.000 --> 13:18.000
I want to make it activated with a book.

13:18.000 --> 13:22.000
You got to pull a book out and it goes click like a Goonies booby trap.

13:22.000 --> 13:28.000
And then it goes open and then you just go in there and just watch the perimeter through the monitors.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
I wouldn't put cameras in my house.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
You can come to a party at my house. I'm not going to monitor you.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
I have my limits.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
You've just said that you will.

13:36.000 --> 13:40.000
If you're outside, I'll be watching you because I got to monitor that perimeter.

13:40.000 --> 13:46.000
What if you get like big, big paintings of people and you have their eyes be little cameras?

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
Oh, yeah.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
I got to mind my parent.

13:49.000 --> 13:52.000
But once you're in my house, your civil liberties are safe.

13:52.000 --> 13:55.000
I'm not Chuck Berry. I'm not going to be like watching you poo poo.

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
You got to totes moms the params.

13:58.000 --> 14:05.000
Now, let's say you had a library that the book was the lever that opened up the secret chamber.

14:05.000 --> 14:09.000
Now, obviously, we can't use this one after we say this.

14:09.000 --> 14:14.000
But right now, what title of book would be the one that you would pull?

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
I think we can use it.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
You come over to my house and you find a bookcase.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
You know what's behind there.

14:21.000 --> 14:25.000
And it's not like my suit of art or my actual Batman armors back there.

14:25.000 --> 14:28.000
Like I'm not a real crime fighter, but it's just fun to be like, you know.

14:28.000 --> 14:32.000
But so, like, yeah, I mean, do you think, I mean, there's two ways to go here.

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
Right now, you've got the Encyclopedia Britannica.

14:35.000 --> 14:39.000
You've got all of Vonnegut. You've got this. You've got that.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
What is the one that you would pull?

14:41.000 --> 14:46.000
What's a fall of the House of Usher? Is that like because you're like walled in?

14:46.000 --> 14:50.000
What are what are books about books or doors?

14:50.000 --> 14:56.000
My question is because it's an interesting thought is would it be your favorite book or something that was somatic?

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
Like you're saying you got thematic, you know, you got thematic.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
Yeah.

15:00.000 --> 15:06.000
So you don't let the right one in.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
I don't know.

15:07.000 --> 15:17.000
I mean, there's a novelization of the Doors movie behind the Green Door.

15:17.000 --> 15:23.000
But you know, I'd go meta and just have the book be like I would I would I would do every single book fake.

15:23.000 --> 15:27.000
I would I would I would I would it would be like one book says this is the one you're looking for.

15:27.000 --> 15:33.000
Yeah, one book would be like will be like tales from the secret door knob.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
Don't touch this book.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
Yeah.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
That would be the one.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
It's going to be great.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
So you're in escrow.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
I've never tried to buy a house.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
So what does that mean for you right now?

15:44.000 --> 15:54.000
Escrow is a flux period of where the buyer no longer has to bid against other people.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
I think bidding is closed.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
And then it's like.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
Was you versus the bank?

15:59.000 --> 16:03.000
It's no it's just it's no it's just a period of time.

16:03.000 --> 16:15.000
It's like a it's like a it's just like a handshake before the before the sex kind of like it's there's still there's still time to there's still time to get out of the deal.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
Mostly on the fire side.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
I just had sex.

16:18.000 --> 16:21.000
I just had sex on the night and the handshake.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
Take their hand and you're like pleasure.

16:23.000 --> 16:27.000
It's a pleasure about to do business with it.

16:27.000 --> 16:34.000
It's like it's like it's made like for me on my side it's a time for me to send over inspectors and stuff.

16:34.000 --> 16:40.000
So you like have someone look at the fireplaces you have someone check out the wiring look for tarantula nests.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
I don't know.

16:41.000 --> 16:46.000
And it's like a time to like negotiate a little bit if you find something that's fucked up like there's a gas leak in this house.

16:46.000 --> 16:52.000
Like you got to knock off a little of the price because I'm going to fix it when I move in or are you going to fix it before I move in.

16:52.000 --> 16:56.000
But you'll be leaving the neighborhood you'll be moving to the valley now.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
Yeah.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
Yeah.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
Yeah.

16:59.000 --> 17:05.000
I wish I could say more but it's not like we ever hang out and like you live walking distance from my place.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
We never hang out.

17:07.000 --> 17:11.000
I'll see you as much in the Valley Valley villages we do now.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
I think so.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
I'll keep my old place.

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
So it'll be like a pietta tear overlooking the drawing room.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
What's that going to be like a bed and breakfast?

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
What are you making there?

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
I don't know.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
A pietta tear baby.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
A pietta tear.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
Yeah.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
For who?

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
Me.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
You'll have your own pietta tear.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
Yeah.

17:28.000 --> 17:33.000
No I'm going to fix it up and see and then I'll feel out like could I rent this yearly?

17:33.000 --> 17:38.000
What was the desire to leave that place and get a new one?

17:38.000 --> 17:42.000
Cody like I want to like Cody didn't want to move into a dude's house.

17:42.000 --> 17:47.000
You know she want to pick a house with a dude and like so that we're starting a new chapter together.

17:47.000 --> 17:52.000
And it needs it needed to be bigger.

17:52.000 --> 17:58.000
Did you have a bubble throat there?

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
Yeah.

17:59.000 --> 18:02.000
I think I'd still be moving around this time anyway but I probably would have ended up

18:02.000 --> 18:06.000
in a rad house with a fucking carousel garage.

18:06.000 --> 18:09.000
I mean I've talked to people who bought some of these modern houses.

18:09.000 --> 18:14.000
Just have a pool and a back house that I can just squat in whenever I need to swim.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
My house is like a hotel now.

18:16.000 --> 18:21.000
I'm actually actively in the market for a Cato.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
Yeah I'm good.

18:22.000 --> 18:25.000
I may end up having to murder someone in the same way.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
Well no get a Cato first and then murder somebody.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
That's exactly what I'm saying.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
What are you talking about?

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
You gotta get you get a Cato Kalen and then you murder somebody.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
I know.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
You think I can't help murder somebody?

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
Oh well no Cato didn't help.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
He's just a witness.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
Oh okay.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
He wasn't even a witness.

18:43.000 --> 18:46.000
He just happened to be in the back house and he heard a thump on the wall.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
He heard a thump.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
Yeah.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
It's a witness.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
You're a witness.

18:50.000 --> 18:56.000
It could have been the thump of corrupt LAPD with a systemic race problem.

18:56.000 --> 19:00.000
That's my John Travolta as what's his name?

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
Oh shit.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
What's his name?

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
It doesn't matter.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
The lawyer.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
Come on guys.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
Robert.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
No the other one.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
Not the Kardashian.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
No that's the black guy.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
Shapiro.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
Is he Shapiro?

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
Robert Shapiro.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
Yeah.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
Travolta with Shapiro.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
Yeah.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
Wow.

19:17.000 --> 19:21.000
A lot of fun performances in that movie.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
Alright.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
Yeah.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
Retiring from public life.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
Now would you have a pool?

19:27.000 --> 19:30.000
How much time do you think you Dan Harmon are going to spend?

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
I think we've covered this topic.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
Alright.

19:33.000 --> 19:37.000
Not much was the answer.

19:37.000 --> 19:40.000
Not much was the answer.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
So Escrow I asked how long?

19:42.000 --> 19:45.000
How long you might pull the trigger on having this new home?

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
30 days.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
30 days.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
Yeah.

19:48.000 --> 19:52.000
And then I'm going to, but I'm like, I'm going to take my sweet time because I love

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
my current house so I'm going to sit over there.

19:54.000 --> 20:00.000
I have people installing right now like this crazy like electronic system in my old house.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
They don't even know they're doing it in a...

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
Your old house.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
Yeah.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
But I'm auditioning them unawares.

20:06.000 --> 20:09.000
Like I'm like let's see if you've got the right stuff.

20:09.000 --> 20:12.000
Maybe I'll let you wire up my bigger house.

20:12.000 --> 20:15.000
I'm just watching them and pretending I live there.

20:15.000 --> 20:18.000
I'm like, oh, what if I wanted to play the stereo?

20:18.000 --> 20:23.000
Oh, well, you know, then you'd go like this.

20:23.000 --> 20:28.000
Or maybe I just go over to my other bigger house, listen to music over there.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
You dumb piece of shit.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
Get back to work.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
What happens to your fish?

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
How did the fish get to?

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
Oh, that is a tough subject.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
Because you got fish.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
Yeah, I got fish.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
And how do they get moved around?

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
They don't get moved.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
What?

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
That's a custom.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
You're going to kill your fish?

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
I'm not going to kill my fish.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
You're going to have your fish murdered.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
Cody.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
Wink.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
And into the fish tank.

20:51.000 --> 20:55.000
It's a custom, like if I can, Breckheimer fish tank.

20:55.000 --> 20:58.000
It's like, it is very Michael Mann.

20:58.000 --> 21:01.000
It was the fulfillment of a dream I had as a child.

21:01.000 --> 21:04.000
I wanted to have a saltwater fish tank.

21:04.000 --> 21:14.000
And then, like, McGathey and I, like kind of custom designed one for the corner, McGathey built this beautiful tavern in my old house.

21:14.000 --> 21:17.000
And part of that was she knew I wanted that fish tank.

21:17.000 --> 21:21.000
And it's like, you know, I've now scratched that itch.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
I'm not a fish tank guy.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
Are these fish going to die?

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
What's going to happen to you?

21:26.000 --> 21:29.000
I don't know how it works when you move out and you've got a fish tank.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
I'm pretty sure it's up to you.

21:31.000 --> 21:34.000
I'm pretty sure that you have your finger on that trigger.

21:34.000 --> 21:38.000
Well, I don't, yeah, I mean, I don't know if you just like, but I'm saying like, I don't know if you just like,

21:38.000 --> 21:42.000
You just wait for the fish that are in there to die of old age.

21:42.000 --> 21:47.000
Like, do you just like keep coming back and visiting them and going like, hey, how's it going, Greg?

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
Like still kicking, huh?

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
Boy, getting pretty empty in there.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
Yeah, well, we're fish, you know.

21:53.000 --> 21:57.000
Usually, usually there's a bit more turnover than this.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
It's just me and the snails now.

21:59.000 --> 22:03.000
I don't expect you to understand how it works out here, but I moved.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
Well, there's plenty of water in here.

22:05.000 --> 22:09.000
How many current alive fish do you have?

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
I don't even know.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
That's why I know I'm not a fish tank guy.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
I don't have names.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
You're a fish murderer.

22:14.000 --> 22:17.000
You might as well be like on Deadliest Catch.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
I'm a fish murderer the same way I am.

22:19.000 --> 22:23.000
Yeah, I'm like how murderer when I buy because I'm not vegan.

22:23.000 --> 22:28.000
I mean, which is a lot because I'm not supporting a marketplace that like,

22:28.000 --> 22:32.000
by buying fish and putting them on display in my house,

22:32.000 --> 22:37.000
I incentivized a marketplace that someone out there is catching and breeding fish.

22:37.000 --> 22:38.000
Yeah, but you...

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
I'm not going to kill these fish.

22:40.000 --> 22:44.000
These fish are fucking as happy as you can get in a tank.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
There's no way to transport these fish into your new place.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
Are you saying you're done with these fish?

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
Yeah, I'm not a fish tank guy.

22:50.000 --> 22:54.000
Which means you're a fish murderer.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
These fish can go...

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
I think you're projecting a lot in there.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
Could you send these fish to a better home is what I mean?

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
Yeah, I'm sure you can.

23:02.000 --> 23:07.000
Do you think I'm going to put them in a net and whip them across the yard or something?

23:10.000 --> 23:13.000
That would be harder than leaving them where they're alive.

23:13.000 --> 23:17.000
But how hard, it seems very hard to find a home for fish.

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
I know.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.000
Next door app.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
Next door app.

23:21.000 --> 23:26.000
Yeah, I can check in with these maniacs that are...

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
Yeah, I should check back in on that.

23:28.000 --> 23:33.000
I wonder if Rebecca ever got her secondhand bark collar

23:33.000 --> 23:39.000
so that she could try one out without expending too much on her mission to make her dog not bark.

23:39.000 --> 23:42.000
God damn it, who was that guy that was on her case?

23:42.000 --> 23:47.000
It was like, your dog is barking because he's psychologically scarred.

23:47.000 --> 23:50.000
And then everyone else was like, give him pills.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
I got pills. Come over, get some pills.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
Oh, I'd love to try those pills.

23:54.000 --> 23:58.000
You're all insane. You need to socialize your dogs.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
Shut up, Greg.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
Greg's the name of the fish, too.

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
Right, yeah.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
I'm not good at making up names.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
So the fish will find the home?

24:10.000 --> 24:16.000
The fish, if I do nothing, which is what I've done as a fish owner here to for,

24:16.000 --> 24:21.000
like, the fish stay alive. Like, among the things I don't do

24:21.000 --> 24:25.000
is tell the person that feeds the fish to not feed them.

24:25.000 --> 24:35.000
I mean, like, I have default mechanisms that ensure a healthy, luxurious life for these fish in their little tank.

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
But I don't know what I'm...

24:37.000 --> 24:40.000
You know, I'm going to have to find homes for them, I guess.

24:40.000 --> 24:43.000
There's a little prawn in there, a couple prawns.

24:43.000 --> 24:44.000
Adorable.

24:44.000 --> 24:48.000
Always wanted a prawn. Then I got one and I was like, boring.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
Looks like a shrimp hanging out.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
It was just when I was a kid...

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
A prawn isn't shrimp.

24:52.000 --> 24:58.000
When I was a kid, we had a freshwater tank and, like, we would go to the tropical fish store.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
My mom was, like, into keeping a fish tank.

25:00.000 --> 25:03.000
I had a plecostomus. I had, like, various things.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
And I was more into it than my mom was into it.

25:05.000 --> 25:09.000
And we'd go to the tropical fish store and then there was the saltwater section.

25:09.000 --> 25:12.000
And, like, that's where all the cool fish were.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
We were like, whoa, this thing looks like a spider in my mom ago.

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
Those are for rich people, you know.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
I was like, those are hard to maintain.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
They're expensive, all this stuff.

25:20.000 --> 25:23.000
And so, just as surely as I...

25:23.000 --> 25:27.000
Whenever I buy peanut butter on Amazon,

25:27.000 --> 25:31.000
I will sort by price descending and pick the top one,

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
because fuck everyone that's ever...

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
You buy your peanut butter on Amazon?

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
Price descending.

25:38.000 --> 25:41.000
If someone out there comes out with a $50 jar of peanut butter,

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
I'll be their only customer.

25:43.000 --> 25:48.000
I blindly, like, I sort things by price descending and click the top one,

25:48.000 --> 25:51.000
because I'm just like, never again, man.

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
Never deprived.

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
So you don't just go roll down to the gelsons

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
and scoop up some peanut butter there?

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
Oh, yeah, no, I love going down to the gelsons.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
The fuck are you talking about?

26:01.000 --> 26:04.000
You think I want poor germs?

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
The fuck?

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
You've become a monster.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
You...

26:10.000 --> 26:13.000
You don't enjoy walking down to the market

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
and rolling around the produce section

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
and go, oh, this apple looks pretty groovy?

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
Oh, yeah, it's great. Yeah, I love that.

26:19.000 --> 26:22.000
I've always loved strangers.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
They're great people.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
I love their babies.

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
I love it when strangers have babies,

26:28.000 --> 26:31.000
take them out in public, and it's my problem.

26:31.000 --> 26:35.000
I love that. I love almost stepping on some urchin's head

26:35.000 --> 26:39.000
and getting a shit look from their terrible parent.

26:39.000 --> 26:45.000
Like, why is your baby rolling in dirt in public?

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
I should have stepped on it.

26:47.000 --> 26:51.000
I should have stepped on your baby.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
But I can't, because then you'd be like,

26:53.000 --> 26:56.000
you'd Google me and be like, jackpot.

26:56.000 --> 27:00.000
People probably put babies in front of me on purpose.

27:00.000 --> 27:03.000
I was at a Target once, and I kicked a baby.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
It was rolling around.

27:05.000 --> 27:08.000
You know those days in Target when there's like a sale

27:08.000 --> 27:11.000
and it just looks like a fucking war zone?

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
You walk in there and go, what the fuck happened to Target?

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
What is it? What are we in?

27:15.000 --> 27:16.000
Fucking Beirut?

27:16.000 --> 27:19.000
Sorry to Beirut, it's the Paris of the Middle East.

27:22.000 --> 27:25.000
But it's like, I kicked a fucking baby.

27:25.000 --> 27:29.000
It was like rolling around in the clothes.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.000
It's like, what is a baby?

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
It just looks like a bunch of clothes.

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
It's a Target covered in clothes.

27:34.000 --> 27:37.000
Everyone's just like, I can't believe people go in there

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
and go, oh, there's a sale at Target.

27:39.000 --> 27:40.000
What's this, $3?

27:40.000 --> 27:41.000
Nah, I don't need that.

27:41.000 --> 27:42.000
Drop.

27:42.000 --> 27:45.000
They just drop it on the floor.

27:45.000 --> 27:46.000
It's insanity.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
Oh, so you've been to a Target.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.000
I've been to a Target.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
This is like 20 years ago.

27:51.000 --> 27:54.000
When I was like, I had the idea I was going to buy

27:54.000 --> 27:55.000
five of the same shirt.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
I'm like, okay, I'll go to a Target.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
It was like a war zone.

27:59.000 --> 28:02.000
And then I'm looking around, I'm like, let me just find

28:02.000 --> 28:03.000
some shirts.

28:03.000 --> 28:09.000
And it was like, I kicked this wet, mushy thing.

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
That wasn't a pile of clothes.

28:11.000 --> 28:12.000
I thought you were joking.

28:12.000 --> 28:13.000
You actually kicked a baby.

28:13.000 --> 28:14.000
Yeah.

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
A human child.

28:15.000 --> 28:16.000
Yes, I kicked him.

28:16.000 --> 28:17.000
I thought you were doing a bit.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
So this child actually rolls around the floor.

28:19.000 --> 28:23.000
Yeah, it was rolling around in the dirty floor clothes.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.000
Yes.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
It was like playing a game called,

28:26.000 --> 28:30.000
bet you think that I'm close and walk on me.

28:30.000 --> 28:34.000
And the mom was just too busy throwing shirts on the floor

28:34.000 --> 28:37.000
and I'm like, I kicked the kid.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
And I was like, oh, shit.

28:39.000 --> 28:42.000
You know, and the kid was like, ah.

28:42.000 --> 28:48.000
And the mom looked at me like, like she gave me this look.

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
Oh, yeah, yeah.

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
I know the look.

28:52.000 --> 28:53.000
We all know the look.

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
Why he kicked my baby look.

28:55.000 --> 28:56.000
I know you baby kicker.

28:56.000 --> 28:59.000
And I was like, I gave her this look.

28:59.000 --> 29:04.000
I was like, do you, I mean, like, come on.

29:04.000 --> 29:07.000
Chase her eyes the look I gave her.

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
Because you say la vie.

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
Okay.

29:10.000 --> 29:16.000
Like how many languages, you know, like we're fucking,

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
your baby going to get stepped on.

29:18.000 --> 29:23.000
Like, like, if I, man, you know,

29:23.000 --> 29:27.000
when I was in public with my mom, she would,

29:27.000 --> 29:30.000
she was like, this is not your house.

29:30.000 --> 29:34.000
She would, you know, like, you go to a movie theater.

29:34.000 --> 29:37.000
If you're like, you're watching a movie and you're like,

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
mom, how come the Jabberwockies don't know that.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
She's like, shut the fuck up.

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
What are you, they're not your living room.

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
Jesus Christ, there's all these people here.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
God damn, she's right.

29:47.000 --> 29:52.000
You know, it's important to be shamed about public behavior.

29:52.000 --> 29:55.000
I have a little bit of anxiety, but like,

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
I'm a better person for it.

29:57.000 --> 30:01.000
I think, like, you know, my mom would say,

30:01.000 --> 30:04.000
what if everyone here did what you just did?

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
How would that work for you?

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
Would you, is that the world you want to live in?

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
Oh God, no, that's gross.

30:10.000 --> 30:14.000
I don't want to live in booger world.

30:14.000 --> 30:17.000
She was a good mom in that sense.

30:17.000 --> 30:20.000
I mean, she really knew how to lay down the suppressive fire.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
What was your aftermath of you kicking the baby?

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
Did everything turn out okay?

30:24.000 --> 30:25.000
We just kind of, yeah.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
It was like flashing headlights at each other.

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
I was like, you kicked my baby.

30:29.000 --> 30:34.000
I'm like, your baby, your baby's laying in dirt.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
We did set it with our eyes, you know,

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
and then she just called the baby's name

30:38.000 --> 30:42.000
and had it, like, you know, you know,

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
squirm over to her.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
Squirm.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
A little larva.

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
A little infant, like, under your older.

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
Yeah, it was old enough to know better.

30:52.000 --> 30:55.000
Like, it wasn't like a baby, like a helpless baby.

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
Like, it was like, it had...

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
A baby of means.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
It had motility.

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
It had, like, it's decision-making.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
It was like, I think I'm going to go over there,

31:04.000 --> 31:07.000
roll around on the floor.

31:07.000 --> 31:08.000
Now, that's not the baby's...

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
But you were so excited about shirts,

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
five apiece, that you were walking around.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.000
So excited.

31:13.000 --> 31:16.000
Willie, Nilly, and just, like, don't even watch us do it.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.000
I was walking.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
No situational awareness at all.

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
That's it. There was no excitement.

31:21.000 --> 31:24.000
Yeah, I wasn't looking for babies.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
That's, yeah, you're right about that.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
I was walking.

31:28.000 --> 31:29.000
Yeah.

31:29.000 --> 31:30.000
Yeah.

31:30.000 --> 31:31.000
Heads up, looking for shirts.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
Babies beware.

31:33.000 --> 31:36.000
Yeah, no, it's stupid that there's babies on the ground.

31:36.000 --> 31:37.000
I agree with that.

31:37.000 --> 31:40.000
Well, I mean, you're kind of taking her side.

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
I'm taking your side.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.000
I mean, you're a contrarian.

31:43.000 --> 31:44.000
No, I'm taking your side.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
I'm saying, like, why leave a baby on the ground?

31:46.000 --> 31:47.000
I went around to it.

31:47.000 --> 31:48.000
You're going to get walked on.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
There was the initial round of, you're always challenging me.

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
You're like, oh, Dan's a piece of shit.

31:52.000 --> 31:53.000
Let's find out why.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
Like, that's what the show is now.

31:55.000 --> 31:56.000
That's fine.

31:56.000 --> 31:57.000
That's what the show has always been, Dan.

31:57.000 --> 31:58.000
The show has always been.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
There was a time when it was like, oh, I'm sharing my life,

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
and you're helping me stay on track.

32:02.000 --> 32:05.000
And now it's like, I just, now I'm not sharing my life.

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
I'm like hiding, and I'm like, oh, no,

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
I ate a hot dog yesterday, and you're like,

32:09.000 --> 32:10.000
you ate a hot dog.

32:10.000 --> 32:11.000
Prove it.

32:11.000 --> 32:14.000
I'm like, I don't know what was the thing between buns.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
Nine buns.

32:16.000 --> 32:17.000
I don't know, like two pieces of bread.

32:17.000 --> 32:18.000
What's your favorite bread?

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
Name three breads.

32:20.000 --> 32:21.000
I don't know, Jeff.

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
Whole wheat, like whole grain.

32:23.000 --> 32:24.000
Whole grain?

32:24.000 --> 32:27.000
Whole grain?

32:27.000 --> 32:30.000
And I can't be like, can I get back to what I was talking about?

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
Because what I was talking about is I hate doing the show,

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
and I wish I was dead.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
I don't want that conversation to finish.

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
No, I'm actually very happy.

32:38.000 --> 32:41.000
I hate doing the show.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
I'm very happy.

32:43.000 --> 32:47.000
I got a new MacBook today.

32:47.000 --> 32:48.000
Thanks, Spencer.

32:48.000 --> 32:52.000
No problem, man.

32:52.000 --> 32:55.000
It doesn't have the little thing.

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
It doesn't have that strip.

32:57.000 --> 32:58.000
Yeah, do you want that?

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
We could take it back.

33:00.000 --> 33:01.000
What is that?

33:01.000 --> 33:02.000
What is that strip?

33:02.000 --> 33:03.000
What does it mean?

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
It's got F keys on it.

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
You know, like the F1 and the F2?

33:07.000 --> 33:08.000
It's got like that.

33:08.000 --> 33:12.000
And I think sometimes it has emojis.

33:12.000 --> 33:13.000
On the keyboard itself?

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
On the little bar.

33:15.000 --> 33:16.000
Why is it different?

33:16.000 --> 33:20.000
Why is that a thing that's on some MacBooks and not others?

33:20.000 --> 33:24.000
I think it's just on the top model for both the 13 inch and the 15 inch.

33:24.000 --> 33:25.000
Top model?

33:25.000 --> 33:26.000
Yeah.

33:26.000 --> 33:27.000
I didn't get the top model?

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
No, I think we talked about it.

33:29.000 --> 33:30.000
We could do that.

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
It's $300 more.

33:32.000 --> 33:35.000
Is it America's top model?

33:35.000 --> 33:38.000
Dan.

33:38.000 --> 33:39.000
Dad.

33:39.000 --> 33:40.000
Dan.

33:40.000 --> 33:41.000
Dad.

33:41.000 --> 33:44.000
Oh, is that what this is?

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
Am I your dad now?

33:46.000 --> 33:47.000
Cody ordered me a shirt.

33:47.000 --> 33:50.000
I will take my belt off right now, Dan.

33:50.000 --> 33:55.000
Cody ordered me a shirt that's aware when it came in tonight.

33:55.000 --> 33:59.000
But there was a shirt online that says dad jokes.

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
I think you mean rad jokes.

34:01.000 --> 34:07.000
But the thing is, the photo of the shirt, like the advertisement for it, it's a picture of a shirt.

34:07.000 --> 34:15.000
And then there's two converse all-stars coming in frame, laying on the corner of the shirt,

34:15.000 --> 34:18.000
just to make it more rad, the shirt.

34:18.000 --> 34:24.000
And I was like, well, I want the shirt, but I want the tennis shoes in there, too.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
I want the whole shirt on a shirt.

34:26.000 --> 34:31.000
So she ordered the shirt, and the shirt's got a picture of a shirt on it with shoes on it.

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
The shirt says dad jokes.

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
I think you mean rad jokes.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
It's a confusing shirt.

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
Can you show me?

34:39.000 --> 34:42.000
We can't show the whole audience, but I'd like to see this.

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
Okay, okay.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
It feels like a courtroom.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
Sure, the bailiff.

34:48.000 --> 34:51.000
Oh, that's nice.

34:51.000 --> 34:54.000
Like it's a shirt with a picture of a shirt on it, right?

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
Yeah.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
Yeah, it's a shirt with a picture of a shirt on it.

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
It's like a hat on a hat.

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
It's a shirt on a shirt.

35:02.000 --> 35:06.000
It's a shoe on a shirt on a shirt.

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
Well, there's no guest tonight, by the way.

35:08.000 --> 35:11.000
What do you think Colin Hanks is going to come out and make it worth your time?

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
No. This is all you get.

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
No, so-and-so.

35:15.000 --> 35:20.000
I think we should do is try to really get back on track on D&D.

35:20.000 --> 35:26.000
Spencer, I think tonight brought, he brought the character sheets and the whole flim flam, right?

35:26.000 --> 35:27.000
Yeah.

35:27.000 --> 35:30.000
You got dice of your own, and we don't have to go out to the crowd.

35:30.000 --> 35:36.000
And I say we really, Dan, you, me, Spencer, get to really figure out where we are,

35:36.000 --> 35:41.000
remember what was going on, and then begin again afresh.

35:41.000 --> 35:45.000
Yeah. Why did I get a new MacBook Pro, you're asking?

35:45.000 --> 35:49.000
Dan, don't you have like 90 laptops?

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
Dan, I have a question for you.

35:51.000 --> 35:52.000
Yeah.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
Why did you get a new MacBook Pro?

35:54.000 --> 35:57.000
Because I've been making music on my iPad Pro.

35:57.000 --> 36:00.000
I took Apple at face value when they said,

36:00.000 --> 36:04.000
you can now produce music on this iPad Pro.

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
It has a USB-C port in it.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
That opens you up to limitless possibilities.

36:08.000 --> 36:12.000
I was like, okay, I'm going to get on the board with this.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
I follow Henny the business on YouTube.

36:14.000 --> 36:19.000
He's into the iPad Pro, and he's written music for Drake or something.

36:19.000 --> 36:22.000
And he's like, people are going to be making music with the iPad Pro.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
I'm like, he's Henny the business.

36:24.000 --> 36:27.000
He does tutorials and stuff.

36:27.000 --> 36:33.000
All this time, last year or so, I've been learning all these apps and things,

36:33.000 --> 36:37.000
spending all this money, USB cables and things.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
They're all buggy.

36:39.000 --> 36:42.000
Here's the only program that works on the iPad Pro for making music.

36:42.000 --> 36:46.000
GarageBand, that's it, without crashing, without having some fatal bug.

36:46.000 --> 36:49.000
All the other ones are just like these weird experimental things.

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
They have different bugs.

36:51.000 --> 36:55.000
If you don't want the bug that's in Cubases too, you can use Oreo Pro,

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
but you've got a different bug.

36:57.000 --> 37:01.000
You can't have bugs that are just like, oh shit,

37:01.000 --> 37:06.000
if you work for an hour on this song, this shit happens that makes it all weird.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
That's not acceptable.

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
I was like, we're not ready for this.

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
It's like VR technology.

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
We keep pretending we want to be in the future,

37:14.000 --> 37:17.000
and it's like, you're going to be making music on your iPad Pro.

37:17.000 --> 37:18.000
No, you're not.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
It's a fucking giant iPhone.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
Get your shit together, Apple.

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
Suck my titty.

37:24.000 --> 37:29.000
I guess they announced a new iOS for iPads today.

37:29.000 --> 37:33.000
Two steps forward, one step back.

37:33.000 --> 37:37.000
There already was an iPad iOS, and then they merged it with the fucking iPhone iOS,

37:37.000 --> 37:40.000
and now it's like, oh no, you need a special iPad iOS.

37:40.000 --> 37:41.000
Yeah, why?

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
Because you think if you're holding a big giant fucking thing in your hands,

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
you might want it to work like a goddamn laptop.

37:45.000 --> 37:48.000
You fucking Apple turds.

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
So I just got a laptop.

37:50.000 --> 37:51.000
I'm like, what am I doing?

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
I'm sitting in bed in my pajamas.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
I'm trying to make music.

37:55.000 --> 38:00.000
I've laptop weighs the same, and it's apparently the only thing that's not going to crash every time.

38:00.000 --> 38:04.000
Logic Pro seems really cool.

38:04.000 --> 38:09.000
So I'm going to be making even better music now, Jeff.

38:09.000 --> 38:14.000
I've been enjoying your Instagram little music nuggets.

38:14.000 --> 38:19.000
Yeah, and I want to wire my car for audio so that I can...

38:19.000 --> 38:24.000
It's just awful singing in the car, and then you bring it home,

38:24.000 --> 38:30.000
and you're trying to EQ out the car sound, and it's just bad.

38:30.000 --> 38:33.000
I keep trying to keep getting all these different mics.

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
I got a lav mic and put it on my seatbelt.

38:35.000 --> 38:36.000
For real?

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
Yeah, and it didn't work.

38:38.000 --> 38:41.000
You can probably get one in your headliner up here above you.

38:41.000 --> 38:48.000
I tried. Lav mics won't work because lav mics have this reaction to the background sound of the car

38:48.000 --> 38:52.000
that's actually even worse than the built-in mic on the iPhone.

38:52.000 --> 38:56.000
As soon as you start driving in the car, there's sound from outside,

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
the lav mics go fucking insane.

38:58.000 --> 39:02.000
They think that you're dragging it down a gravel path, and it blows out all of the audio.

39:02.000 --> 39:05.000
So you need a hardwired mic in your car.

39:05.000 --> 39:10.000
Yeah, I need to get shotgun mics that are special and point them out.

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
I bet if you got on the phone...

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
Do that again?

39:14.000 --> 39:18.000
Yeah, I need to get special shotgun mics.

39:18.000 --> 39:21.000
One over here, one over here.

39:21.000 --> 39:26.000
I bet if you called a sweetwater or the Sam Ash or the people like that, they would...

39:26.000 --> 39:27.000
Yeah.

39:27.000 --> 39:28.000
Don't die.

39:28.000 --> 39:32.000
Oh, no, no. That's not how I'm going to die.

39:32.000 --> 39:35.000
Were you coughing at the mention of sweetwater?

39:35.000 --> 39:39.000
Yeah, well, I'm coughing at the mention of working with audio people.

39:39.000 --> 39:43.000
No offense to our audio people.

39:43.000 --> 39:47.000
I mean, I know that is the solution, but it's just like...

39:47.000 --> 39:50.000
Yeah, but they would sort that out for you like straight off the bat.

39:50.000 --> 39:55.000
It's just hard because the vibration translates like through the whole frame of the car.

39:55.000 --> 39:59.000
They don't go into audio because their personalities are wonderful.

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
I hope our audio people didn't hear that.

40:01.000 --> 40:05.000
What are some jobs that you go into because your personalities are wonderful?

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
Like an actor.

40:07.000 --> 40:12.000
You know, I wish my car needed acting.

40:12.000 --> 40:15.000
I called Joel McHale.

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
I've had him in my car.

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
It makes the car better at acting.

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
It's great. Actors are great.

40:21.000 --> 40:22.000
Very pleasant people.

40:22.000 --> 40:27.000
Technically psychotic, I mean, their job is to pretend cameras aren't there.

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
It takes a little bit of a...

40:29.000 --> 40:32.000
But I mean, they don't make that your problem.

40:32.000 --> 40:33.000
They're performers.

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
I don't trust that actors are good people.

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
I just trust that they're being good at acting.

40:37.000 --> 40:40.000
Right, their personalities are great.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
Well, their acted personalities are.

40:42.000 --> 40:46.000
Yeah, their front-facing personalities.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
The part that you have to touch.

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
That's great.

40:50.000 --> 40:54.000
It doesn't have audio guys sweat on it.

40:54.000 --> 40:57.000
But you're going to suffer now by not having...

40:57.000 --> 40:58.000
You're going to have to try...

40:58.000 --> 41:02.000
We're going to suffer because our audio guys are going to put fart sounds all over the rest of the show.

41:02.000 --> 41:05.000
Slurpee, slurp, slurp sounds.

41:05.000 --> 41:10.000
But that would be pretty cool to trick out your car with mics so you could just have always a camera on you

41:10.000 --> 41:13.000
and always have mics on you that you could just do whatever you wanted.

41:13.000 --> 41:16.000
Yeah, I want to take that on as a little hobby.

41:16.000 --> 41:19.000
Get excited about the technical application of it.

41:19.000 --> 41:22.000
Because I find that when I get into just the...

41:22.000 --> 41:26.000
By the time I get that figured out, that's when I start to like...

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
I lose interest in the creative.

41:28.000 --> 41:32.000
Why don't you call up the people that do cash cab or something like that and just say, hey...

41:32.000 --> 41:37.000
I think there's people I could bring into it.

41:37.000 --> 41:38.000
I just kind of...

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
Why don't you do cash cab?

41:40.000 --> 41:44.000
Yeah, once you get it all figured out, you can just do cash cab.

41:44.000 --> 41:47.000
I think cash cab doesn't drive very fast.

41:47.000 --> 41:51.000
So once you hit a certain speed, it kind of changes the nature of the vibration.

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
Yeah, because in New York, you never go anywhere.

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
You're stuck at a stoplight the entire time.

41:55.000 --> 42:00.000
I guess part of the reason I don't immediately ask for outside help is because

42:00.000 --> 42:03.000
I really love going to Fry's electronics.

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
I just love to spend a weekend there.

42:05.000 --> 42:09.000
When you go into Fry's, do you like finding a clerk there and saying, hey...

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
No, I love that it's a wasteland now.

42:11.000 --> 42:16.000
I love that the internet has turned Fry's into just this weird ghost town.

42:16.000 --> 42:20.000
So you're just freestyling in there and just saying, I think this is what's going to work.

42:20.000 --> 42:24.000
I just wander down Isles and go, oh, that looks like it's shaped like a metal thing.

42:24.000 --> 42:27.000
And you never see a clerk and go, hey, buddy, come over here.

42:27.000 --> 42:32.000
If you see a clerk, they nervously dart into a back room with a box that they were taping up.

42:32.000 --> 42:38.000
Their job is to index the plexiglass that has all of the shit locked down

42:38.000 --> 42:41.000
that could be stolen and valuable.

42:41.000 --> 42:48.000
The only people there are people that need shit that you can get faster

42:48.000 --> 42:51.000
by driving down to Fry's than you can on Amazon, which is like...

42:51.000 --> 42:56.000
When you had your fish tank angularly fixed into the wall of your place,

42:56.000 --> 42:59.000
you didn't just go freestyle. You had somebody on the phone.

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
Or was that Aaron doing that?

43:01.000 --> 43:04.000
I'm saying at some point you've reached out to the strangers and said,

43:04.000 --> 43:07.000
I need help with this. Let's make this great.

43:07.000 --> 43:13.000
Oh, you mean the ongoing eight-year process of trying to make my house

43:13.000 --> 43:16.000
able to play a Phil Collins song when I want to hear one?

43:16.000 --> 43:23.000
Yeah, that $1.2 million project, consisting of team after team

43:23.000 --> 43:26.000
of fucking professionals coming in for consultations

43:26.000 --> 43:31.000
and then ripping the walls apart and putting more fucking ethernet cable

43:31.000 --> 43:35.000
throughout it and asking me more questions

43:35.000 --> 43:39.000
and only to tell me that what I want doesn't work with whatever the fuck.

43:39.000 --> 43:46.000
That little hobby, yeah, not satisfying, which is why I kind of...

43:46.000 --> 43:53.000
Maybe it's a recourse to my self-esteem and masculinity

43:53.000 --> 43:57.000
or something that I want to wire my car for sound and have control over.

43:57.000 --> 44:02.000
I would literally put a little mixer on my dashboard or something.

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
Just don't kill yourself in your car.

44:04.000 --> 44:08.000
Make sure that your eyes are on the road when you're doing all this.

44:08.000 --> 44:11.000
You've already expressed that, and I find that adorable.

44:11.000 --> 44:14.000
Every time I watch your videos, I love them and they're hilarious,

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
but I was like, oh, don't die on camera.

44:16.000 --> 44:19.000
But then you wouldn't have died on camera because you go back and edit them

44:19.000 --> 44:20.000
and put lyrics on them.

44:20.000 --> 44:26.000
But when I tell you that, of course, I'm driving carefully,

44:26.000 --> 44:29.000
you're like, yeah, but your eyes are darting all around.

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
You're watching me drive defensively.

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
I've never been in a car wreck.

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
I'm a defensive driver.

44:35.000 --> 44:39.000
When I'm singing, you can see me being like...

44:39.000 --> 44:43.000
I have my own hang-ups about people worrying about people getting in car wrecks,

44:43.000 --> 44:44.000
so that's my own thing.

44:44.000 --> 44:48.000
I wish I was so good at singing that I could lose myself in it enough to have a car accident.

44:48.000 --> 44:51.000
I think that's Celine Dion you're thinking of.

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
I'm not going to be like,

44:53.000 --> 44:56.000
like close my eyes like Mariah Carey or something.

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
I'm gesturing the notes that I'm getting.

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
Have you seen that thing where...

45:00.000 --> 45:04.000
What's the fucking late night show host that I don't know?

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
He had Celine Dion in his car.

45:06.000 --> 45:07.000
James Corden.

45:07.000 --> 45:11.000
Yeah, and he brought Celine Dion in his car,

45:11.000 --> 45:14.000
and they just did karaoke in his car.

45:14.000 --> 45:15.000
It's great.

45:15.000 --> 45:16.000
It's really good.

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
Then the whole time, I'm worried that they're going to die.

45:18.000 --> 45:22.000
So you can wire a car for sound is what I'm hearing.

45:22.000 --> 45:23.000
I just got to figure it out.

45:23.000 --> 45:27.000
They probably had a guy laying down in the backseat with a boom mic and shit.

45:27.000 --> 45:31.000
That's how I've performed in cars.

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
There was always a boom guy in the backseat for real.

45:33.000 --> 45:39.000
They probably had a sound mixer laying down in the back.

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
I saw a guy on YouTube video.

45:41.000 --> 45:42.000
He was like,

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
oh, here's how you podcast in your car.

45:44.000 --> 45:47.000
He had a preamp that he recommended in live mics.

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
He said you put the live mic on your seatbelt,

45:49.000 --> 45:53.000
but I thought I got everything that he recommended and it sounded like shit.

45:53.000 --> 45:54.000
I don't know if you mean...

45:54.000 --> 45:55.000
I don't know.

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
The thing might be you can't get on the freeway or something.

45:57.000 --> 45:58.000
It definitely helps.

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
I podcasted in my car too.

46:00.000 --> 46:04.000
The faster you go, when you hit, say, 35, it gets worse.

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
45 is a lot worse.

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
And then there's different kind of consistencies of roads.

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
So like some roads, when I get on it gets all fucked up,

46:10.000 --> 46:13.000
but if I stick to other ones, it's fine.

46:13.000 --> 46:17.000
I'm surprised that sound doesn't work like green video

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
and that you could just say,

46:19.000 --> 46:24.000
hey, here's a sampling of the sound of my car on the freeway.

46:24.000 --> 46:27.000
Remove that from this audio.

46:27.000 --> 46:28.000
You can.

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
I don't think it's perfect, but you can definitely do that.

46:30.000 --> 46:31.000
It definitely helps.

46:31.000 --> 46:35.000
It's because there's a part of me saying the word pickle

46:35.000 --> 46:39.000
that's also using the same part of the audio spectrum

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
as the sound of the freeway.

46:41.000 --> 46:42.000
Yeah.

46:42.000 --> 46:46.000
And so you can't do it without me sounding like...

46:46.000 --> 46:49.000
You're removing freeway sounds from my throat.

46:49.000 --> 46:52.000
There's all sorts of in-betweens though.

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
You can definitely get it better.

46:54.000 --> 46:58.000
And then there's also just like the better audio apps

46:58.000 --> 47:02.000
have just a way to remove sounds below a certain threshold.

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
So like when you're talking or something

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
or when you're not talking, if it's too quiet,

47:06.000 --> 47:07.000
you just won't hear that.

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
So if it's like a low road sound, it'll just be gone.

47:09.000 --> 47:13.000
There's something kind of satisfying about the pursuit of sound.

47:13.000 --> 47:14.000
Oh yeah, it's great.

47:14.000 --> 47:15.000
I mean, I love sound.

47:15.000 --> 47:16.000
Sounds so cool.

47:16.000 --> 47:17.000
And it's like, it's different.

47:17.000 --> 47:18.000
I don't know.

47:18.000 --> 47:19.000
Video editing is probably the same,

47:19.000 --> 47:20.000
but I just like audio editing.

47:20.000 --> 47:21.000
It feels so powerful.

47:21.000 --> 47:24.000
You can just really get your hands on it and like rip it apart

47:24.000 --> 47:25.000
and do stuff to it.

47:25.000 --> 47:26.000
And I don't even know what I'm doing.

47:26.000 --> 47:27.000
And I don't even know what I'm doing.

47:27.000 --> 47:28.000
Such a thing is perfect silence.

47:28.000 --> 47:32.000
And you know, yeah, just like ways to like optimize.

47:32.000 --> 47:36.000
But it's like beyond working in black and white,

47:36.000 --> 47:39.000
it's like you're just working in sound.

47:39.000 --> 47:43.000
And it's like, it's like, I think I can see the appeal of that.

47:43.000 --> 47:46.000
Or you're like, I could control this world.

47:46.000 --> 47:50.000
I want to do sound design and stuff.

47:50.000 --> 47:51.000
That could be cool.

47:51.000 --> 47:52.000
Yeah.

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
Hey, you want to, you want to, you want to,

47:54.000 --> 47:57.000
you want me to give you a little starting library of stuff?

47:57.000 --> 47:58.000
Sure.

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
This is a champagne cork.

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
Holy shit.

48:02.000 --> 48:08.000
Here's a, here's a, here's a window opening.

48:08.000 --> 48:13.000
Old, old timey choo-choo train starting up.

48:13.000 --> 48:25.000
Choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo...

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
Woo-hoo!

48:27.000 --> 48:28.000
That's very good.

48:28.000 --> 48:29.000
Yeah, thank you.

48:29.000 --> 48:32.000
The, the, the battle of Stalingrad.

48:32.000 --> 48:33.000
Ah!

48:35.000 --> 48:36.000
Dostoevsky!

48:39.000 --> 48:40.000
Dostropia!

48:40.000 --> 48:45.000
Oh, Dossboot!

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
Wow, there's a German guy in there.

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
German sufferator.

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
They were fighting the Germans.

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
Yeah, someone lost their boot.

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
Or found one of their...

48:58.000 --> 49:01.000
That boot. That particular boot.

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
That's the weirdest part of that movie, Dossboot,

49:03.000 --> 49:06.000
is when the guy just looked at the camera and says,

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
Dossboot.

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
He doesn't do that.

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
How about...

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
Can I give you more sound ideas?

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
You want like a scary haunted house?

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
Probably just for...

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
Just general purpose haunted house atmosphere.

49:26.000 --> 49:47.000
There's a cowboy in there fighting both the Dracula and the ghost.

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
Give me...

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
If your Dracula and your ghost start fighting each other,

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
just put a cowboy in your haunted house.

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
He'll sort shit out.

49:55.000 --> 50:00.000
Dracula waking up and realizing he needs a shave and shaving.

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
So this is Count Dracula having a morning shave.

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
Count Dracula waking up and saying he needs a morning shave.

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
Yes.

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
Well, first of all...

50:12.000 --> 50:15.000
You tried to trick Dracula into killing himself.

50:15.000 --> 50:18.000
Right, but whatever morning means to Count Dracula.

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
Okay, it was midnight, I think.

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
It could be the opposite of Cock-a-doodle-doo.

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
It's midnight when the strip is hot.

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
That's when Dracula gets out.

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
Blah.

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
Oh, blah.

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
Blah.

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
Blah.

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
Oh, blah.

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
Blah, blah.

50:51.000 --> 50:54.000
The last part was him going like, I don't have any blood.

50:54.000 --> 50:57.000
So I cut myself shaving. B-F-D.

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
Big fucking Dracula.

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
Wouldn't he be full of blood after a good night's sleep?

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
He'd be mostly blood.

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
He'd be hungry.

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
He wakes up at midnight hungry for blood.

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
Of course he needs...

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
It's half of the reason he's waking up.

51:11.000 --> 51:15.000
For breakfast, he's like, I just bled at McMuffin.

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
I'm hungrier than I used to be.

51:17.000 --> 51:20.000
I'm saying I don't even think anything comes out.

51:20.000 --> 51:24.000
I think whatever he got the previous night by sunup.

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
Spiders?

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
Oh, spiders come out.

51:28.000 --> 51:31.000
I mean, look, you're free to interpret.

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
Let's say...

51:38.000 --> 51:41.000
Robert De Niro is...

51:41.000 --> 51:47.000
is having a bad time in the backseat of an Uber.

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
Okay.

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
For Robert?

51:59.000 --> 52:08.000
Yes.

52:12.000 --> 52:16.000
You going to a museum?

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
Downtown museum?

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
Huh?

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
What?

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
Yeah.

52:24.000 --> 52:31.000
Let's say Robert De Niro decides to get out of that Uber

52:31.000 --> 52:34.000
because he's having a bad time, gets into a helicopter,

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
and then starts a lawnmower.

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
Okay, okay, okay.

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
I just... No.

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
I turn... I go to Western.

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
Don't take Western. Don't take Western.

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
Don't just go to Franklin.

52:46.000 --> 52:49.000
No, I take sweetie. You don't know.

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
Let me out. Just let me out of the Uber.

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
Let me out. Let me out.

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
Let me out. Let me out.

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
Let me out of the Uber. Let me out of the Uber.

52:57.000 --> 53:01.000
Also, an English ambulance goes by as this is happening.

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
Fuck's sake.

53:19.000 --> 53:22.000
Throw in a can opener while the chainsaw's going.

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
All right, lawnmower, lawnmower, lawnmower,

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
lawnmower, chainsaw, can opener.

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
The helicopter changes gears.

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
The lawnmower is still going,

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
but somebody needs to open a can of peas

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
and an electric can opener is there.

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
You hear that?

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
That was the lawnmower was going,

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
and then the electric can opener was on top of it.

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
Where's the chopper?

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
I mean, the chopper's drowned out by the lawnmower.

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
Come on, man.

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
Rest in peace, Roger Huebner.

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
We did it.

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
Yeah.

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
That's a deep track for us.

54:07.000 --> 54:11.000
When I met Dan in, what, was it, 94 or something like that?

54:14.000 --> 54:17.000
Well, I mean, you want to talk about Roger Huebner, you can.

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
I mean, Rest in Peace, Roger Huebner,

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
he's a comedy sports sound effects guy.

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
He was buried with his microphone.

54:25.000 --> 54:29.000
I was at Little Dom's with Danny DeVito,

54:29.000 --> 54:33.000
and the can opener,

54:33.000 --> 54:37.000
the waiter who was taking our order,

54:37.000 --> 54:40.000
and it was like,

54:40.000 --> 54:43.000
Danny DeVito was like,

54:43.000 --> 54:47.000
oh, that was a chicken parmesan.

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
It's the size of a manhole cover.

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
You want to split it?

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
I was going to order the chicken parm, too.

54:53.000 --> 54:56.000
And he's like, all right, we'll split the chicken parmesan,

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
and the waiter's like,

54:58.000 --> 55:01.000
uh-huh, and he's got kind of this weird look on his face.

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
He's kind of like fidgeting,

55:03.000 --> 55:07.000
and he finishes taking the order.

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
It's a big table full of people.

55:09.000 --> 55:12.000
Doing a little project with the DeVito clan.

55:12.000 --> 55:15.000
I'm sitting here, rare dinner,

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
and I'm eating with Danny DeVito.

55:17.000 --> 55:18.000
It's fun.

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
The waiter's like fidgeting,

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
and he's like, uh-huh, yeah.

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
Okay, so you wanted this,

55:24.000 --> 55:25.000
and you wanted that,

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
and then he's just like,

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
he goes like,

55:29.000 --> 55:30.000
um,

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
uh, Michael Keaton's here,

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
and he just got...

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
I love him,

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
and I love him about it.

55:38.000 --> 55:42.000
He's like, there are little doms every day, almost.

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
The staff there, it's a fancy place.

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
There's a lot of celebrities coming through.

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
So he was nervous about you and Danny DeVito.

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
He was nervous that Michael Keaton was sitting right over there.

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
He, I mean,

55:52.000 --> 55:56.000
because Batman was in the same restaurant as the Penguin is...

55:56.000 --> 55:57.000
Oh!

55:57.000 --> 55:58.000
Oh, shit!

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
And so the waiter was like...

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
I mean, it's like...

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
The waiters there are like,

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
they know better than the...

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
Like, for all they know,

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
they're gonna get yelled at,

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
fired, who knows?

56:12.000 --> 56:13.000
Like, for, you know...

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
Los Angeles in general has a culture of,

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
you're supposed to treat famous people like ghosts,

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
you know, you're not supposed to...

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
Because they dress funny and they have unfinished business.

56:21.000 --> 56:24.000
But the more you acknowledge them,

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
the more it's like, what are you, a tourist?

56:26.000 --> 56:27.000
Like, get out of here,

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
especially if you're a server at a place

56:29.000 --> 56:32.000
where there's traffic with celebrities.

56:32.000 --> 56:35.000
I imagine your manager would be like,

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
what the fucking...

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
Kirsten Dunst come through here

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
and you fucking like asked her for a selfie,

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
you piece of shit, that was the first famous person

56:43.000 --> 56:44.000
that ever came in this restaurant,

56:44.000 --> 56:45.000
she could have turned into three famous people,

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
but you chased her off, you smothered her!

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
You know, I imagine that that's what it's like,

56:49.000 --> 56:52.000
that there's that culture unconsciously or not.

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
And so it was just like extra funny for him

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
because he was clearly so...

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
The irony was too much for him.

56:58.000 --> 57:01.000
He wasn't like star fucking, he was like...

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
Michael Keaton's here, it's too much,

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
he can't handle it, it's like the fucking...

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
And I was like, whoa, whoa!

57:07.000 --> 57:08.000
If Christopher Walkenwalked in,

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
then it'd be fucking, yeah, forget about it.

57:10.000 --> 57:13.000
And then DeVito's like,

57:13.000 --> 57:16.000
like, ah, maybe I'll go talk to him later.

57:16.000 --> 57:19.000
Like he's like, all right, I'm a baller.

57:19.000 --> 57:22.000
And then later on, here comes Michael Keaton

57:22.000 --> 57:25.000
and I was like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
You know?

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
I thought we settled this.

57:29.000 --> 57:32.000
Yeah, like guys, not here.

57:32.000 --> 57:35.000
And then Michael Keaton kind of,

57:35.000 --> 57:38.000
he's carrying a toddler.

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
But not his own.

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
Well, I don't know.

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
Yeah, there was a screaming woman like,

57:44.000 --> 57:48.000
stop, stop, stop that famous man.

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
Stop that Batman.

57:50.000 --> 57:51.000
He's got my toddler.

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
Batman stole my baby.

57:53.000 --> 57:54.000
He's just kind of like hoising,

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
like a very, very like confident,

57:56.000 --> 57:57.000
like dad thing where you got the kid,

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
like kind of sitting on your bicep kind of thing.

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
Like, you know, like kids that kind of just,

58:01.000 --> 58:05.000
you know, situated on the one arm

58:05.000 --> 58:08.000
and he's carrying him and then he,

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
and then I think he was, yes,

58:10.000 --> 58:13.000
ending my bit of like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

58:13.000 --> 58:14.000
You know?

58:14.000 --> 58:17.000
And he kind of like, Michael Keaton kind of

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
looked at Danny and then like,

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
he kind of went, ah!

58:21.000 --> 58:22.000
And I just thought it was so funny,

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
it was like, yeah, like,

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
and I really don't say this disparagingly.

58:26.000 --> 58:29.000
I'm like, God, to get so old

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
and to have such a full life that you're like,

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
you played Batman and you just kind of forgot

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
what Batman is.

58:37.000 --> 58:38.000
Like, he's just like,

58:38.000 --> 58:41.000
maybe it's like Godzilla, I don't know.

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
Oh yeah, we fought in a movie.

58:43.000 --> 58:44.000
Ah!

58:47.000 --> 58:48.000
And Danny DeVito did the same thing,

58:48.000 --> 58:49.000
like, ah!

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
I was like, these guys don't know.

58:51.000 --> 58:52.000
They, for all they know,

58:52.000 --> 58:55.000
they were the mummy and like fucking Frankenberry.

58:55.000 --> 58:58.000
Like, they're just happy to see each other.

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
The mummy and Frankenberry.

59:01.000 --> 59:02.000
That's the best.

59:02.000 --> 59:03.000
But then the crazy thing is,

59:03.000 --> 59:04.000
like, then the two famous people,

59:04.000 --> 59:07.000
like, you know, they talk to each other,

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
but it's like, table full of people,

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
they were all participating in the joke,

59:11.000 --> 59:12.000
like a spectacle,

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
but then you have to kind of like stare at the table

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
and wait for them to finish talking,

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
because you can't, you're not friends.

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
You don't know these people.

59:20.000 --> 59:23.000
Then they just talk about God knows what,

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
and yeah.

59:25.000 --> 59:26.000
That's great.

59:26.000 --> 59:27.000
Yeah.

59:27.000 --> 59:30.000
And then Jim Rash was there from community.

59:31.000 --> 59:32.000
He was outside in the front,

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
and Levi's like, Jim Rash is here,

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
and I was like, ah!

59:40.000 --> 59:43.000
That should be the new thing, no matter who you meet.

59:44.000 --> 59:47.000
You see an extra girlfriend, ah!

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
By the way, you know, not to be this guy,

59:50.000 --> 59:51.000
but just to report in,

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
like, Michael Keaton looks fantastic.

59:53.000 --> 59:54.000
Yeah.

59:54.000 --> 59:57.000
He's out there looking fantastic right now.

59:58.000 --> 59:59.000
Yeah, he was Birdman.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:00.000
How did Jim Rash look?

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:01.000
He looked like a Birdman.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.000
Yeah, you're right.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.000
I mean, he's just out there looking good.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
Jim Rash is a little sketchy.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:08.000
I heard he's gotten jacked.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
No, he did look, yeah, you look like he's probably,

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
I mean, he always was pretty fit.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
I believe it.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
I don't believe it.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
He was with, I believe his writing partner,

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:19.000
Matt.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:20.000
And yeah, they were,

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
and he was telling me about the project

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
they just finished doing,

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
which I'll assume I'm not allowed to talk about,

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.000
but whatever.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.000
I don't know.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:29.000
It sounded exciting.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:33.000
Whatever.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:34.000
This has been the celebrity.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.000
I get excited.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:36.000
For God, I was at a restaurant

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
with the fucking Batman and the Penguin.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:39.000
Yeah, I saw you recently.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:40.000
You didn't tell me this story.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:41.000
God, I mean, what a way,

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.000
it was like, everything in me,

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:43.000
it was like, God damn it,

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.000
do you fucking like,

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
like, what a wasted,

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
you know, like, ah!

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.000
You can't, though.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:50.000
I can't, I couldn't.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
It was impossible, like, to be like,

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.000
guys, they hate to do it,

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
but could I get a photo,

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.000
you know, and like,

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
like, be separating them and,

01:00:58.000 --> 01:00:59.000
you know, it's just,

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:00.000
what an Instagram.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
That would have been what we call a golden gram.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:06.000
You guys would,

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
you guys would have loved that.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.000
On my Instagram,

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
you would have given it a heart.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
That's why you're an influencer.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:14.000
Yeah.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:16.000
Yeah.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
You never know when you're going to get one of those.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.000
Oh, look at that.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:20.000
Right?

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:21.000
That's Batman.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:22.000
Oh, there he is.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:23.000
There's the penguin.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:24.000
Oh, look who's in the middle.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.000
Oh, the so-and-so.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
I've been watching the berries.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:28.000
I love berry.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
The HBO is a great show.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.000
And years ago,

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
I was at an airport,

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
maybe I've said this before,

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
and somebody walked up to Henry Winkler,

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
who was just waiting for his plane,

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.000
like, at the gate,

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:41.000
sitting in the chair.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:42.000
And somebody said,

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.000
Mr. Winkler, I'm a big fan.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Can I get a photo?

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
And he goes, no.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:49.000
I was like, that's the best.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:52.000
He wasn't mean about it.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:53.000
He was very polite.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:54.000
Like, no.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
I'm happily not taking a photo with you.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
What's the one, Malcolm McDowell?

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:02.000
I was at the airport.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:03.000
Have I told this one on the show?

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Malcolm McDowell from a fucking

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Clarkwood Orange and what?

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Entourage?

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:13.000
I think, I don't know that.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:14.000
But Malcolm McDowell was,

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
we're in Calgary airport,

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.000
and he was,

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
like, looking at magazines at the,

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
like, the bookstore place that has

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
crap, you know, books and magazines

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
and M&Ms and whatnot.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
And a guy walks up,

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
like, a young, young-ish,

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
you know, kind of fanboy,

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.000
and comes up,

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
Mr. McDowell, I'm a huge fan of yours.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
Can I please get a photo

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.000
or an autograph?

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
And he goes, no.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
And the fucking kid just,

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:46.000
just fucking boned out.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:47.000
And I was like,

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
I was watching this go down,

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
like, wow, that was fucking harsh.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.000
I've told the story before.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:53.000
You must stop me.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
You may have, but it's not.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:56.000
But then it's the cowboy hats,

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
because in Calgary's stampede,

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
they give you the cowboy hats.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:01.000
So we had done a show,

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
and if you're a performer in Calgary,

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
the Chamber of Commerce

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
gives you a white Stetson hat

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
with a maple leaf on it,

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
and it's like, it's a big,

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
it's like symbol of honor from Calgary.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:16.000
So me, Greg Proops, Ryan Stiles,

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:19.000
Chip Esson, we all have our hats,

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
and we're all getting on the same plane together,

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:22.000
and Malcolm McDowell's in front of me,

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
and he has his hat too.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
So we're all loading in the first class,

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
we've all got cowboy hats.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
I must have told the story before.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:31.000
I bet you did, but it's like,

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:32.000
I don't know, it's so long ago,

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:33.000
I don't remember.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
If we both forget, then who cares?

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
Yeah, well, let the audience decide.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:38.000
Well, I mean, but they're helpless.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:39.000
They're hostages.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:42.000
Let them sit there and remember.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:45.000
Why don't you marry remembering stuff?

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
You should have took a picture.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:48.000
So we're getting on the plane,

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:49.000
and he's in front of me,

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
I'm number two getting on,

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:52.000
and he's got his cowboy hat,

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:56.000
and he's just told this poor kid to bone out

01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:00.000
politely asking for interaction with Malcolm McDowell,

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
and he didn't dig it.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
So he's in front of me,

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
and we're waiting to get on,

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
like, sit in our seats,

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:11.000
and he's in row one, and I'm in row two,

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:14.000
and he's putting his hat up in the bin,

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
and I go, oh, I see you've got a hat too.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
I'm just trying to find a way to talk to him.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:21.000
And he goes, oh, yes, yes, I see you've got yours as well.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
I said, how did you get yours?

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
I said, I'm wearing like skinny jeans

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:28.000
and like a motley crew shirt.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:31.000
And I said, well, I'm a professional bull rider.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:34.000
And he goes, you are?

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
Okay, now I remember.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
And I go, no.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
And he goes, oh, I wish you wouldn't have said that.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:43.000
He would have been so happy that I was a professional bull rider.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:46.000
He wanted to eat that Joe Pantoliano steak.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.000
What?

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
Matrix, Matrix.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
Oh, wow, you lost me on that one.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:52.000
But no, I got you.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
The steak was more delicious.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:55.000
And then we watched him overact

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
while he was learning his lines for entourage

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
the whole flight.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:02.000
I wonder what it takes anecdotally,

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:07.000
because I think to myself, like, what would it take

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:13.000
to ever arrive at a place where someone, you know,

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:17.000
acknowledging recognition of you?

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Somebody being like, hey, look, there's Dan Harmon

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
in Line at Fries, you know?

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:26.000
Which I'm like, what would it take to make that

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:30.000
so fucking like that you would be like, no!

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:33.000
And I know the answer, like, I'm not an actor.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:34.000
Have you ever done that?

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:35.000
Have you ever been in a bad mood

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
and somebody walked up and wanted some interaction?

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:38.000
No, never, ever.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
I mean, I've been, I've only been,

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
I think we've talked about this before.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:45.000
There's only been like probably two instances

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:48.000
in my entire life of anyone ever talking to me,

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:52.000
like, in that context.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:55.000
And it was only, it was, the person was,

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:56.000
look, I'll be honest with you,

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:59.000
I'm not a huge fan of the fucking autographed guys

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
that sometimes like come out here,

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:02.000
and I'm sorry if you're in the audience,

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:03.000
because if you are, then I misjudge you,

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:04.000
because part of why I don't like them

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
is I don't even think they come into the fucking show.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:09.000
I think they, and I don't think they really give a fuck,

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:14.000
and they like, they strike this tone of like,

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:17.000
that's based on the shared culture we all have,

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
which is you should be grateful for somebody

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
to want your autograph, which you should.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:26.000
But like, they build on that mythology

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:29.000
and use the same, and go like,

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
at festivals and stuff, there's people,

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
they don't know who you are,

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
they just like, they get like some heads up

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
about who you are, like they're just there

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:40.000
to like collect these piles of fucking signatures,

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:43.000
they don't give a shit, and then that's fine too.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:46.000
But like, the way that they try to,

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
they play into your guilt, like they go like,

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
come on man, come on man, I've been out here all day,

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:55.000
like they say shit that like, is so inverse to like,

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:59.000
come on man, fuck you, you can't high road me,

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:04.000
and like, that's it, it's people that are disingenuous.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:08.000
Nobody that's like hat in hand,

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:12.000
and I told the story of that guy at the billiards place

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
that like, did everything wrong,

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
but I still wasn't mean to him ever,

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:19.000
I just like made fun of him on the show like later,

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
because he didn't really know who I was,

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:24.000
he thought I was Justin and he didn't like whatever,

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:27.000
but it's still, I'm just, I truly curious,

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:30.000
like cause I'm sure the answer is like really wonderful,

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:33.000
like what is it that happens to the Barbara Streisand's

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
of the world, the Malcolm McDowell's like,

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:38.000
what stories do they have about people just like,

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:41.000
like just, there must be horrible things

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:44.000
that have happened to them because they allow it.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:47.000
Somebody I know went up to like George Harrison

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:50.000
at the airport, LAX, and he was eating breakfast,

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
and he walked up to Mr. Harrison, can I get an autograph?

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:55.000
And he goes, no, like I'm fucking having breakfast,

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:58.000
like you don't get to walk up and interrupt everything.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
By the way, I have three co-workers,

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:04.000
and one of them got shot doing this.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
Eating breakfast, yeah.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Like 25% of the people that do what I do die this way.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
You're not catching me stoked ever.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:16.000
Spencer, do you get, how much do you get rumbled

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
for being Spencer walking down the road?

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
Not really, pretty rarely.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:23.000
Is it comfortable or uncomfortable for you?

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
I'm fine with it.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:26.000
It's great.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:27.000
You know, the thing about pictures,

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
I always tell people who are awkward,

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
like the thing about pictures and autographs

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
is they really frame the interaction.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:36.000
You know what they want, you know when they have it,

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:39.000
and they know that they can now leave satisfied.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Whereas if they don't ask for that,

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:44.000
they kind of just like orbit and say things like,

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
I'm so nervous, I don't know what to say,

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:47.000
you probably think I'm a loser.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:50.000
Well, you're not giving me a lot of other options.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:58.000
Like I guess I do, okay.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:01.000
But I mean, and it's fine to talk to people too,

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
but it's just like, but when you ask for an autograph,

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:06.000
it's like, yeah, then you can shoot the shit or something,

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
but then they're like, oh yeah, now I have my autograph,

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:11.000
I'm good to go, and so that's always great.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:15.000
But it's very rare for, I don't know, for people,

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
sometimes people just want to ask a lot of questions,

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:20.000
and it seems like they're just searching for questions to ask,

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
and that's not always the best, but even that's not bad.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:25.000
The worst time I had was like this really drunk guy,

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
I want to say in Chicago or something,

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
that was like no joke wanting me to like get in

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
on his business opportunity,

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
like wanting me to buy a time share or some shit.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
It's like, I don't want any of this,

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
and there's other people that want to talk to me too,

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:38.000
and I want to talk to them,

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:41.000
and I don't want to buy your time share or whatever, you know.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:44.000
That was the worst, but it's always really great.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:47.000
I worked with this guy who said,

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:50.000
I don't know, it was like one of these Beatle guys.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:53.000
He worked with one of these Beatle guys in Britain,

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:56.000
and he was drawing a little doodle.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:59.000
Sorry, when you say Beatle guys,

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
are we talking about Ringo Starr, what's going on here?

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
Yeah, it might have been George Harrison, I don't know.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
It's one of these Beatle guys, right?

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:09.000
You don't know, you worked with one of them?

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:12.000
No, I worked with a guy who worked with a Beatle guy.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:15.000
Oh, so a Beatle guy, yeah, okay.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:18.000
I would have remembered if I worked with a Beatle guy.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
It would have been your job to remember, yeah.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:21.000
Right, exactly.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:24.000
But he was like drawing a picture,

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:27.000
and then he put it down,

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:30.000
and then one of his assistants came and took the picture

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:33.000
and put it into a folder and whisked it away,

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
and he was like, why did that just happen?

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:40.000
He was like, well, these people stole my lyrics out of my car,

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:43.000
and they're in a museum, and they won't give them back now.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
So now I have this guy, and he takes all the stuff I touch,

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:48.000
and he photocopies it and keeps it away from people.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:51.000
And that's like a level of fame where you probably are,

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:54.000
just like, I mean, your whole worldview must be upside down

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
just because it's like people will just fuck with your shit.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
That was Paul McCartney for sure.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:01.000
Oh, it might have been Paul McCartney, yeah.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:04.000
I told this story when I was at South by,

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:07.000
and I was on the same flight as Padgett Brewster,

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:12.000
and there were people waiting outside the airport for her,

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:15.000
which was a different level.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
It was like not just waiting outside the airport

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
because there's celebrities coming around because it's South by,

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:23.000
but they had shit that was Padgett Brewster related.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
But then there were also people that were like,

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
no, they had a bunch of blank pieces of paper,

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:30.000
photo paper, like glossy paper, which by the fucking,

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:35.000
ugh, when you sign photo paper, it's like nails on chalkboard.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:39.000
It's like that squeaky freak, I don't know.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:42.000
We'll talk about unrelatable harm and what the fuck.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
Because I remember somebody was like,

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
oh, you too, can I get you,

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:49.000
it was just like throwing me a bone because there's just blank things.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
And then I walked into the airport,

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:54.000
and they acted like they thought I was famous because I was with you,

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:57.000
and she's like, yeah, but you know what?

01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:01.000
Those people, they make me sign those blank pieces of photo paper,

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:04.000
and then they print fake nudes on them.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:08.000
And then a fake nude signed by Padgett, what?

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:12.000
That just blows my, that's almost too hilarious to be abused,

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:16.000
because it's just like, oh, look, I mean, it's like, what?

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
You're selling that?

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:21.000
Look, she signed, is it like a troll thing?

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:24.000
It sounds like probably the intent is like she did it

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:27.000
for someone she was intimate with and it's like stolen.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
It's like, oh, this is a real thing.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
She sent a boyfriend or something.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:34.000
She also did say that,

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:38.000
she said she tends to get pulled aside at TSA checkpoints

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:43.000
because she was on this criminal minds show or whatever.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
Created by me.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:51.000
The TSA people are really into these certain mainstream crime dramas,

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
and they always recognize her,

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:57.000
and she said an inordinate that they'll pat her down.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:01.000
Yeah, and it's like, they're not, I don't think, I mean,

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
I don't think she would want me to say,

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:06.000
imply that they're doing it so that they can touch her.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:09.000
It's more like they want to take her aside

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:12.000
and then tell her they're a big fan.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:16.000
They're not going down the giving of the full business of Padgett.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:19.000
I think it's kind of like, yeah, special check your bag thing,

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:22.000
and then it's like, by the way, can I get a selfie?

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:27.000
Because I would hate to imply in this climate,

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:30.000
we need to take that shit seriously, this idea of,

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
that wasn't part of the idea,

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:35.000
was that they were doing it to grope.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:38.000
But it's still fucking crazy, the idea that they're like,

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
oh yeah, random spot check.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
I think your bag smells like explosives,

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
so can you come over here?

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:47.000
By the way, big fan cha-ching!

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:50.000
I mean, you expect more from the TSA.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
Spencer, I'm going to come over there and grab

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
some character sheets.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
Did I fill the time?

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
This is why I got to become a musician,

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
because when I moved to L.A.,

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
I was like, hey, let's go see Harry Dean Stanton

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
at this hotel lounge,

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:09.000
or you go see Jeff Goldblum play piano.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:12.000
It was part of the L.A. culture.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:16.000
I either got to stop doing this show,

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:19.000
or I got to learn the clarinet or something.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:22.000
Because it's like, dumb otherwise.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
I'm tired of it.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
What am I supposed to tell you about?

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
I can't tell you anything about my new house,

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
because then you can come and shoot me.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
I can't tell you I'm afraid you'll shoot me,

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
because then that's alienating.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
Oh, please shoot me.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:39.000
Oh, what a cool guy wishes he was shot.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
There's no reward in it.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
I'm not being provocative or being a dick

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
by asking this question,

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
but have you fired your gun and used it

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
to change your...

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
No, my actual gun, no.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
I'm afraid to fire it because the first thing I did

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
when I bought it is take it apart and clean it

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
and put it back together.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
So now it's a gun that's been assembled

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
by a fucking idiot.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
It should just have a sticker on it

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
that says, like, a fucking liberal

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
that got scared because Trump got elected,

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
put this together.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
Don't ever pull the trigger.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
It's going to blow up in your hands.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
That's why I want to get a revolver.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
Yeah, because that's the thing I couldn't wait to do.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
I mean, I was like...

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
I always wanted to, like, take a gun apart.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
So I did.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
Now it's a bomb.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
And then I, like, put it back together.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
I'm like, well, that doesn't seem like it should be rattling.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
I guess they rattle in the movies,

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
but I always thought that was, like, overindulgent

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
Foley artists, you know?

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
Like, every time John McClain, like, goes like this,

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
the gun goes like...

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
I just always thought that was, like, audio guys

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
being like, oh, man, fucking, like, clinkity, clink, clink.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
Give me more clinks on that.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
But it's like, no, those things really

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
kind of rattle in your hand, which

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
it just makes me feel like it's going to blow up

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
when I shoot it.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
Genuinely terrified. Which is good, though,

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
because I told the story of the guy in my porch

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
and, like, you know, and Spencer's talked about how

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
they do studies where you touch one of these things

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
and your testosterone goes up

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
and, like, the danger of having one of these things.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
It's like, it's good to think

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
that it will explode if I fire it.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
Like, that's better than...

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
That second best to not owning a gun

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
is being so afraid to fire it

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
that, because you think you probably

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
kill yourself.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
You know, you can blow up your hand

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
along with the intruder.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
Yeah. Unless you're trying to kill yourself

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
with a gun, then it's, like, about the same.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
That would be amazing if you got the gun

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
and then you're like, I'm going to blow my brains out

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
and then it, like, goes...

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
It just takes your hand off.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
Yeah. And you're like, ow.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
And they're like, what's your emergency?

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
And you're like, I blew my hand off.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
And they're like, sir, calm down.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
What was the thing you told you...

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
Oh, yeah. Someone sent us...

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
Here, let me pull it up.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
Someone sent us, or me,

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
an Instagram message.

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
Yeah.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
I just had it.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
You know, Dan says that

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
in these podcasts, whenever you call 9-1-1,

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
they tell you to calm down or whatever.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
And someone's...

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
This is a good story, huh?

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
No, it is good.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
I love our fan community.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
Somebody sent you a message basically

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
saying that they had an experience

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
where they called 9-1-1.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
And because they needed to calmly inform...

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
Yeah. Shit, I can't fucking...

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
Hold on. Everybody shut up.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
Yeah, the guy needed to call 9-1-1

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
because he saw someone passed out in the street

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
and he thought they needed medical attention or something.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
And the rest, be surprised you.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
Cat underscore E underscore Reyes writes,

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
off topic to this post,

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
but driving home today,

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
I found a man passed out in a park

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
and while calmly calling 9-1-1,

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
I was told to calm down.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
I just think it's so funny.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
It really happens.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
Why do they tell you to calm down so much?

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
That's their one joy in life.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
If you call them calm,

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
you're going to end up in prison, man.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
This guy was so calm.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
I'm telling you, I'm going to be so calm

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
if I call 9-1-1

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
that I'm not going to call 9-1-1.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
I'm going to try to fake,

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
like, panic.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
Like, I'm going to come home.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
If Cody's murdered, I'm going to be like,

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
oh shit, Cody got murdered.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
All right, I'm going to call 9-1-1

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
and they're going to think I did it

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
because I'm going to be calm

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
because I'm, like, compartmentalized.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
I don't know, I have a fucking thing.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
That's a problem.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
So then I'm going to go like,

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
oh my god, my wife is dead.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
And they're going to be like,

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
that's fake.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
Yeah.

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
There's this situation

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
I drove by

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
kind of near your neighborhood

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
where it seemed like some,

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
I don't know, some plain clothes cops

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
who just looked like guys with guns

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
in their waistband, like,

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
were accosting this dude in a car

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
and trying to pull him out of his car

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
and the guy was screaming for help, I'm pretty sure

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
because the cops didn't identify themselves as cops.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
And so I was like, I don't know what to do

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
and I called 3-1-1 and I didn't go anywhere

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
and then I called 9-1-1 and it was just like

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
jammed, the lines were jammed,

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
like I couldn't get through and I'm like,

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
it's a good thing this isn't an emergency happening to me.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
I'd be out of luck.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
I have to meet with an estate planner,

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
which is a meeting

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
that is just really easy to keep cancelling.

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
Sure.

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
When are you ever in the mood to have coffee

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
and talk about what should happen when you die

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
with all your money?

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
I'm just always like, oh, is that at noon today?

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
Yeah.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
I'm folding my socks.

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
I kind of feel like that would be a fun meeting to have.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
Yeah.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
I keep a note

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
in my iPhone updated.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
Well, you take mine.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
Because here's what I want to tell the person.

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
Because I told Cody,

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
we're getting a house together.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
I definitely, here's a nightmare scenario.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
Something God forbid happens to me.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
Let's just call it hit by a bus

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
even though we know that bus is going to be

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
cholesterol.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
But

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
let's just say it's like

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
sudden and unexpected

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
and it's just done.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
The idea of

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
loving Cody, moving the house together.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
We're not married yet.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
And she's just living in this house

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
that she's not

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
she chose it with me

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
but she's not

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
she doesn't have a claim to it if I die

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
and then

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
all of a sudden some horrendous

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
relative from Wisconsin

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
who knows.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
Like shit town.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
Yeah.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
I don't know how that shit works.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
So anyway,

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
there's a nightmare scenario to be avoided

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
and Cody and I are aware of it.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
But then I'm like

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
another problem if you're like

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
driving with Cody and I'm like

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
I want to plan my estate.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
But you need to know

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
there needs to be a Schrodinger's box here

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
so that you're not incentivized to kill me.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
Like

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
and she's like

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
I'm not going to kill you.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
That's what she'd say if she was going to kill you.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
That's what you'd say if you were going to kill me.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
And I'm like look,

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
here's what I'm going to do.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
When I plan my estate

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
I'm going to have no matter how

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
unmisterious my death is

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
like

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
let's say I'm worth 5 million when I die.

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
I'm just picking a number

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
that's based on when you look up the thing

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
it says like what are they worth.net

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
or whatever it's for

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
it says I'm worth 5 million.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
I don't know what that means.

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
But

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
let's say that's what I'm worth

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
and then

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
I'm going to put in my

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
will

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
a million dollars is earmarked

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
for a private investigator.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
It doesn't even matter if it looks like a heart attack.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
That's smart.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
He or she, you're welcome.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
200,000

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
dollars

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
for expenses

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
to launch an investigation

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
as if

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
my death were mysterious

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
even if it's not mysterious.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
If it's mysterious, 400,000

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
but

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
the remainder of the million

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
payable upon

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
conviction of the murderer.

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
So here's what

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
and then Cody's like

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
but that means he would frame me

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
and I'm like what it means is your job

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
is to keep me alive.

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:45.000
It also means she'll be

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
she'll have a vested interest

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
in trying to make herself

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
as innocent as possible

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
and keep tabs in that way

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
no matter what she's plotting.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
It just means when the pizza comes

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
if I'm a certain amount of drunk

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
don't make me go down for it.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
There's stairs here.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
You could end up in jail.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
People will assume you murdered me.

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
Or she'll videotape you while you do that.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
I mean she'll just start wearing a GoPro

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
everywhere.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
A body cam, yeah.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
She's like well just put

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
mysterious circumstances. I'm like oh yeah

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
right so you can like crush up

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
Adderall and put it in my vodka

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
and like oh yeah what a non-mysterious heart attack

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
that would be. Give me a break.

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
Everyone's just waiting for me

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
to keel over from a hot dog.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
I want that shit

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
investigated.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
Yeah I think that could be really fun.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
You could put some more money to like

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
document the process and like make a movie out of it.

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
Yeah. Put it on Netflix.

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
The death of Dan.

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
I wonder

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
if you can make do it like percentages.

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
Like whatever my net worth is

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
you probably can.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
10% shall go to

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
Private Investigator.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
Yeah.

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
That's a death I could have fun planning.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
You know if they

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
tops you of your body though

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
that'll like maybe make it look gross.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
Is that cool?

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
Yeah. Okay.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
I already look gross.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
Yeah. Hey you said it.

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
The grosser I look

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
the more people understand that I did well

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
with my life you know. Like they're like

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
why am I looking at his body? I'm like yeah exactly.

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
Sucker.

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
I'm not Marilyn Monroe and you're looking at me

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
naked dummy.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
Looks like I'm talented.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
Fuck face. Keep looking.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
Taking every inch you fucking jerk.

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
That's why I don't put a piece of tape

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
over my laptop camera.

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
I'm like take it in CIA.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
of it.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
Put it in the Library of Congress.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
Make a statue of me

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
jerking off fucking spies.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
Who cares?

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
Can you imagine?

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
Like what if I became like a

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
what kind of like activist do you have

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
to become like how much of a threat do you have

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
to be before the NSA

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
uses secret footage of you jerking off

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
on your MacBook? Like they just release

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
like well like how would that work on

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
anybody you know like like

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
this modern day MLK

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
is causing too much trouble he's suggesting

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
people should withhold their income taxes

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
until medicine is socialized.

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
So he jerks off.

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
Love jerking off.

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
I'm coming.

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
You can see the come in this one.

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
Look at that come.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
What a monster he jerks off.

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
It's not going to work.

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
It's not going to work on anybody.

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
That would be a refreshing world.

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
I hope that leaks.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
I hope footage of all of us jerking off leaks.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
You could leak it.

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
You should.

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
Let's get it started.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
I think it's called YouTube.

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
You could

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
not only have your camera on your computer

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
open but put a green screen behind it

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
so the NSA could really make it fun.

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
I always kind of I throw

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
in little things hoping like I can like

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
trigger something. I'll be like jerking

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
off. I'm like yeah you like that.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
Oh you like it when Al-Qaeda comes

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
on your tits?

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
No you don't. That's pretty good.

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
That'll really do it.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
Suspenser

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
D&D

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
You've given us brand new stuff here.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
You've moved us over from Pathfinder

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
I see to a D&D based

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
thing so I'm going through

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
my exciting new character sheets.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
I spent a good portion yesterday

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
converting all your character sheets

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
to 5th edition.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
Wow.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
5th edition fans.

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
And you put our spells and abilities

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
on special groovy little cards here.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
I made spell cards.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
You made these?

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
I mean I didn't photoshop them

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
but I glued them onto note cards.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
You did. I love this.

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
You've given little dots for ones that are

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
always prepared for my spells.

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
I tried to do you know I

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
I don't know. It's fun.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
It's like an arts and crafts task.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
No I'm digging it man.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
I could read this all night long.

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
And let's just read your spells.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
Let's start off with

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
inventory.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
I used to just give Steve Levy

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
inventory stuff to talk about here.

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000

How's things in the romance world?

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
Or should I ask?

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
Things are good.

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
You got a squeeze now?

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
Yeah.

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
You got a partial squeeze?

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
I got a squeeze.

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
Partial squeeze.

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
Levy squeeze.

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
We have confirmed Levy squeeze.

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
Houston we have Levy squeeze.

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
I was about to ask

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
you tell me.

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
The answer is obvious

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
because I won't reward you for it.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
I have more pressing matters

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
to talk to you about.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
I'm a cold son of a gun.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
Remember when I got drunk in New York

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
and I sent you a nice text?

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
I'll never forget that text.

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
Damn.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
It was an amazing text.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
What was the text?

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
The nicest things anyone could ever say.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
We have to start D&D

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
at the beginning of the show

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
because we're never going to ever...

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
I like talking with Levy.

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
I don't care if we ever get to it

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
but Spencer did all this amazing

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
paperwork here.

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
Sounds like he kind of care.

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
I do care.

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
Spencer I'm very excited about this.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
I do mean the stuff I say when I'm drunk

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
by the way.

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
Unless it's racist.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
I haven't...

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
That stuff is just like...

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
I'm going through all this text to me

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
validating how much you meant it.

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
All that stuff about Building 7

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
is just that vodka talk.

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
Stuff about you being a good friend

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
and me wishing the best for you.

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
That's just the polar ice caps

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
of...

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
the world.

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
I think the best we can do

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
before the time runs out

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
is that we just go through

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
where you've set us with a new D&D

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
5th edition set up here.

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
The thing is

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
in 5th edition your character sheet

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
has a little spot for

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
personality traits,

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
bonds and flaws.

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
Maybe we should work those out.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
I know that'll be exciting for the audience

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
but it's helpful

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
and it might help you

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
get some...

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
Get some.

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
D&D is all about getting some.

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
Personality traits.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
Did you guys remember

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
well obviously Jeff remembers he likes fire.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
Do you guys remember your characters at all?

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
Diarrhea Jr.

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
Diarrhea, you're into...

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
We know you love horses for some

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
strange reasons.

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
I know my character.

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
Alright.

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
Well then it should be easy to pick a personality

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
trait or two.

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
How does that help us throughout the gameplay?

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
Because then you know that's

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
kind of a part of your character.

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
I would say lately Chad

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
has been like he's trying to

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
kick the bee's nest or something.

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
That's just kind of who he is.

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
So if you write that on your character

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
and then you look at it, be like,

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
ah that's who I am.

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
So this box on the right

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
are the traits?

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
And I get to pick two of those.

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
The top right, one or two, yeah.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
We could do this later I guess.

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
Oh, I could write in anything myself?

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
Yeah, that's the idea is that

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
we'll kind of reacquaint you guys with your characters

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
now that they're new in fifth edition.

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
You can't put like constantly

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
finding treasure.

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
That's not...

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
That's a dream, not a trait.

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
Tends to hit more

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
when he attacks.

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
Yeah, I would fly.

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
So it would be a good

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
example of a personality trait

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
let's say for Chad, the fire liker.

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
I would say he's itching

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
for adventure. At least lately.

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
That's like been a big thing of your life.

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
We can't be fucking potato farming.

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
I'm going to call that

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
wanderlust. Yeah, there you go.

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
I like it.

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
It's dumb.

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
I'm just trying to encourage...

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
No, you have to. I do have to.

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
But it could help

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
or not.

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
Ideals, what's that about?

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
Ideals is like what you value

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
kind of like your virtue,

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
like what you find important.

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
Yeah.

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
I'll have to think about that one.

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
Oh yeah, well like fire for instance.

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
Well yeah, we know I like fire,

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
but is that more like in a

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
like a spiritual or philosophical thing?

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
Bonds.

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
Bonds are better than ideal honestly.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
Bond is like what you care

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
about. What if it was Rob

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
from you would really get your goat

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
and make you murder people

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
or go out and find stuff.

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
And flaws.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
Flaws are personality flaws, yeah.

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
Yeah.

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
I'm afraid of the dark.

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
I have to go back and read.

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
Or you could just come up with a new one

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
since you don't know.

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
I'm going to use the audience because you guys

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
have a show and you remember more than we do.

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
Oh that's a good idea, yeah.

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
So somebody, let's spitball.

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
What are Chad's ideals?

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
Virginity.

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
I don't know about that.

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
Courage.

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
Courage.

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
I like it.

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
So my deal would be courage.

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
Courage doesn't mean I'm courageous,

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
it just means I wish I were more courageous.

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
You want to like

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
brashness almost.

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
What's my bond?

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
Yeah, it's burning.

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
You can't bond with fire.

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
And

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
Chad's a flaw.

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
Yams?

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
No. Yams.

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
What's the yams?

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
You just wanted to say yams.

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
He is impulsive.

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
Yeah, and hubristic.

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
Impulsive. Okay, I like that.

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
I wanted to say it.

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
I wanted to say it.

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
So Levy,

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
for my personal traits, I thought

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
spontaneous and easily impressed.

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
I like that, that's great.

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
What about your ideals?

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
Can you give me some examples?

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
Like upholding the law

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
or always being kind to people.

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
Oh, kindness is key.

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
Kindness is key, write that.

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
Then bond.

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
I don't know of course.

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
I don't know.

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
Carlos isn't bad.

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
Yeah, because he's like

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
these guys are your kind of family.

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
My father figure.

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
And flaws then.

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
Probably you're naive, I'd imagine, right?

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
So naive. There you go.

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
Hell yeah.

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
This is going better than I thought.

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
It's not going great.

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
What are your personality traits?

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
Well, I feel like I'm insecure.

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
I like that.

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
I mean, do you think it's a good strategy

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
and a meta sense to like

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
to embrace the way you're

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
tending to play?

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
Or do you think it's a better idea to go against that

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
so that you don't like fall back on that

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
because I tend to be

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
insecure in my playing.

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
But maybe if I was playing a character

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
who I'm like, oh, my character's like

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
ooh, he's Johnny Bigadona.

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
I see the ladders a little better.

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
But it's probably not.

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
How about one of your traits is

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
overthinking it?

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
That could be one.

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
My characters always like to be

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
just relaxed and not

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
rock the boat.

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
But I'm not

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
suggesting that. That's just like...

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
So your ideals, Harmon?

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
How do you say overthinking it?

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
Like in personality traits?

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
Neurotic warrior.

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
Neurotic.

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
That seems like a good...

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
My ideals, I would say

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
like virtue,

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
like what...

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
I want to do it right.

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
Virtue's good.

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
I want to leave the world better

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
than I...

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
Just justice.

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
Redemption? Redeemer?

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
There's a redemptive quality to what you want to do.

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
You want to kind of redeem what's gone wrong.

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
I want to be a

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
good person and I want...

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
Tradition, charity, power, faith.

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
I'm just

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
listing them off. Not like they'd be a good idea.

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
Other people, redemption,

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
creativity, friendship, aspiration,

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
independence, fairness.

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
Rehabilitation over punishment.

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
Yep.

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
Well, okay.

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
I think they could all fall under

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
the head, the mast head of

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
justice, righteousness,

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
whatever.

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
Because these are ideals. They're not necessarily reflective of

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
what I end up doing.

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
It's what you aspire to, I guess, right?

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
Yeah, I want to be known as a good guy.

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
Right, exactly.

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
When I'm dead.

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
That's exactly it.

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
Or I want to...

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
All right, bonds.

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
Okay.

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
I'm going to change mine

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
from courage to purify.

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
Sure.

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
Like fire.

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
Yeah, exactly.

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
You...

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
It could also be a motivation.

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
Someone stole my precious instrument,

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
and someday I'll get it back.

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
That's a bard.

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
Kato Farms.

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000
Yeah, you're a potato farmer.

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
I owe my guild a great debt for forging me into the person I am today.

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000
Well, what about control?

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
Is that cheating?

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
Control over what?

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
Control.

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
What have I been doing?

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000
What's the potato farm really about?

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
I love a potatoes.

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000
It's about me wanting...

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
My narrative, you know?

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:11.000
I don't want other people to be in charge of...

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
But that's too esoteric.

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
It should be something more like, my spurs.

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
My boots.

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
My pet cobra.

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
Part of it's supposed to be like a hook for your motivation.

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
So control could be something,

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
but I think it also kind of

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
can tend away from things, too.

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
That's English.

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
I'm striking out today, huh?

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
Yeah.

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
Well, I'll put control freak under

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
flaws.

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
Yeah, that's good.

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000
Which doesn't mean controlling others necessarily.

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
It's just like...

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
very cautious

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000
to surrender control.

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000
Yeah.

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000
But like a bond is like,

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
everything I do is for the common folk,

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000
or I will do everything

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
to protect this house

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000
or something, you know?

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
Yeah, well, it could be...

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
Yeah, maybe something to do with the church.

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000
Right, you want to maybe

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
right the wrongs of the church,

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
or you never want to reflect the corruption

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
that you've seen in the church or something.

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
Maybe my actual relationship with the silver flame,

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000
because even though I have a bunch of problems

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
with the way the church is run,

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000
but if anyone would ever tell me,

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
you're a bad Catholic, plain and simple,

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
it would drive me nuts.

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000
Like, my bond with my god,

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000
you know, super important,

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
doesn't necessarily mean that if I get in a fight

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
with the pope, I'm going to be anything more

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
than conflicted. Right.

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000
But when it really comes down to it,

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
like, I really buy into the silver flame

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
Michigan. Is there a personal

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000
relationship with the silver flame? Because it's been so long, Dan,

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000
is there a part of your character that it wants

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000
to be kind of reinstated in some way,

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000
or are you so outcast and so...

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000
I think I want to be purified.

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
The church of the silver flame is... I'm into purification?

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000
Yeah, me too.

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
I think that there's stains

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
on me that I don't think can be

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000
scrub clean, except by

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000
extreme

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
deeds of

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
righteousness

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
and something that would block

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
out all the memories

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
of me just being a flawed,

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000
fallible,

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
terrible, complicated, clumsy person.

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000
Yeah, well, that's going to be a bond.

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000
It's a need to fix

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
the sins of the past or something.

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000
Yeah, I said before, redemption.

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000
Reputation or...

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000
Redemption.

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000
It could be a sentence or anything,

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000
too, just gets the concept across.

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
Redemption.

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000
Redemption.

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000
It could even be redemption.

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
I wrote it down.

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000
I'm just not going to remember it.

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000
When I look at that, it says, bonds, redemption.

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000
I'm not going to be like, oh, yeah.

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000
Yeah, that's the thing. A lot of these, they recommend

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
bonds that kind of have some flair

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
that are kind of like a taggable asset.

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000
My bond says flair. I know I like

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000
flair, but my bond has to be something

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
more like what I'm bound to, right?

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
I mean, it's just what's important

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000
to you, what drives you.

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
You could be adventuring because

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000
your little sister is poor, and so you send

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000
all your treasure back home to make sure

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000
your family stays alive. That could be a bond.

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000
I put redemption, parentheses, the idea

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000
that it's possible.

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000
Yeah, I think that's great.

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
That's why all of our actions

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000
are so important.

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
Why are you looking at me?

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000
Because you can't just love a horse so much

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000
that you join a cult.

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000
That's the shit that makes me start

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000
a potato farm. I'm like, what are we

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
fucking doing? We spent the last

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000
six chapters doing nonsense.

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000
I just want to start fresh

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000
on a potato farm because I'm a control

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
freak that really believes that we could

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
accomplish something if we tried to.

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
I don't want to tell you guys.

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
Spencer, do you have all my old stuff?

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
Yeah.

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
Give me that after the show

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000
and I'll go back

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000
before the next show, and I want to go back

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000
and reread everything that I had.

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
Yeah, well, a lot of that's no longer relevant.

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
Right, but there's some character stuff

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
that I think... Okay, yeah, no problem.

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000
Like your notes and stuff. Yeah, yeah, I got all that.

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
Great. Spencer, whatever happened

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
to Patchen's gem? That's a great question.

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
I want to say

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000
Patchen's was kidnapped

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000
by someone at the town

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
and then...

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
I really can't remember, and if anyone...

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
I was going to ask if anyone could remember,

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000
but I feel like they'll fuck it up.

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000
Are we kind of just like scrubbing the slate here

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
like a race on the board

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
just starting? It's like a reboot.

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000
Yeah, it is like a reboot. It's like, you know...

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000
It's like...

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000
We put blue contacts

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
in Jessica Alba's

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000
eyes.

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000
I think it's more like Universal had the rights

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000
to... The whole can now Disney

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000
has the right to... Yeah, it's like...

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000
Oh, yeah, we're switching from

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000
shitty Spider-Man's

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000
to the ones where he's just Iron Man Junior.

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000
Right.

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
I think Patchen's gem got stolen.

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000
It went to the town. You guys went to the town to find it.

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
I don't think you found it

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
unless... Did he... Did they find it?

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000
They did find it.

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000
They found Patchen's gem, but then they didn't

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000
find Patchen's.

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000
Patchen's disappeared. Okay, great.

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000
What happened? I feel like Patchen's run off.

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
That really fucked with me.

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
Patchen's was like, I don't need...

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.000
I don't want you guys to help me.

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000
That's why he went to the town, and you followed him

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
to the town anyway, and then he

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000
mysteriously disappeared.

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
But going forward, is there any

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
hangover from our previous quest

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000
that we still feel is unfinished business?

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000
Are we driving forward into new...

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000
We'll find out. Yeah, I mean,

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000
the ghosts of your past

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
might come back, but I don't

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
think you care about it too much, because

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
it's been... You've spent a lot of time

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000
committing to farming. Okay, we fucking...

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
We suck. We're terrible at this.

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000
Think about it like the fifth Tomb Raider

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
movie.

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000
There is one. It's not called Tomb Raider 5.

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000
They don't want you to watch the first four.

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
Is there going to be some shit in the first four?

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000
Maybe if you're a huge Tomb Raider

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000
movie fan, you're like, oh...

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
We're not answering any questions from the previous

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000
Tomb Raider. We're just writing another

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
tomb. More or less. Okay.

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000
There were some big unanswered questions, though.

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000
One of the first villains

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000
we fought was going to be

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000
probably a big bad...

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000
They destroyed the church basement.

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
I forgot about that. They were eating cows and stuff like that.

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000
Then there was a Ho-Oh kind of

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.000
flying in the air.

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000
Big evil demon. Yeah.

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
Man, that was great, huh?

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
There was a lot of setup happening.

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000
We spent our whole time just beating up a family

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000
that had

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.000
nothing to do with anything. It was cool, though.

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000
I like it. Yeah.

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000
Anyway, sorry about all that.

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000
No, no, it's good. Hopefully.

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000
We start afresh. It's going to be

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
some serious D&D. We have new character sheets.

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
I'm very excited about that. I like that on my extra

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000
notes. It just says, eat my ass

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000
exclamation point. Yeah, you... I didn't write

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000
that. You wrote that. I guess I did.

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
I don't know why. Okay, so let's talk about

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000
group inventory, Spencer. Group inventory.

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000
So one of the things I

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000
figured out was that... Well, I used to give

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000
Steve the group inventory sheet because

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000
I thought he was the most responsible, but then I was

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000
like, well, no, everyone should have the group

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000
inventory sheet, and then they'll know what they

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000
all have on them. So it's like your collected wealth.

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000
And then the idea was you

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000
wanted to become farmers. So if you ever wanted

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000
to sell your stuff to buy farm

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000
equipment, it would be helpful

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000
to know all

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000
the stuff that you could sell and all the wealth you had

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
because it's not on your character sheet.

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000
So where is that on this? I don't see farmer

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000
equipment. You don't have any. Okay.

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
We're grass roots.

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000
I mean, you might have a couple shovels and stuff,

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000
but you haven't really bought a lot of farm equipment.

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000
I think you just bought some potato seeds.

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
So under group's own gear, you have a little

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000
bracket here. We have a

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
bow.

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
Yeah, that's your own stuff. That's like stuff

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
if you wanted... If you, for instance, wanted to

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000
commit to farming so hard, you sold all your

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000
weapons and armor. That stuff's on your group

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000
inventory sheet, and it has like monetary

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000
value. Like you could sell your bow for too gold.

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000
I dig it. Okay. What are the relics? Are these

01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.000
important anymore? They're just items

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000
you have. I mean, I don't...

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000
The relics are relics. You never discovered

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000
what they were. They were just something you picked

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000
up and forgot about because it was on Steve's

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000
group inventory. We have a hundred pounds

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
of beef jerky. Yeah, it was in a bag of...

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000
Does that expire? No, it's beef jerky.

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000
No, it's dried for a reason. I don't know.

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000
I've had some gross

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000
old beef jerky. I've had some moldy beef

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000
jerky. Oh, don't bring it up.

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000
It's a sensitive, sensitive

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
spot for this audience.

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000
There's beef...

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
Good times. Beef fungus.

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
Oh man, remember that. Yeah.

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000
Classic. If he's listening, he's going to blow his brains

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000
out. That could be

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000
funny. No, that

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000
would not be funny.

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000
Hello, William. We love you. Yeah, yeah.

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000
Bag of

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000
holding. Yeah, bag of...

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000
You stole it from that guy who is the mayor

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000
of Fightsville. One poison

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000
pill. Yep, you stole that off of

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000
Assassin. That was the Assassin

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000
who took Patchen's gem. He didn't

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000
take it. A different one did. Black

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000
Dragon shards. That was also on the Assassin.

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000
You didn't know what that did. Right.

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000
But you could find out.

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.000
Two Masterwork daggers.

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000
Those are more expensive than regular daggers.

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000
Those are also owned by the Assassins. Okay.

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000
So these are all like company

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000
stuff we all have together.

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000
Yeah, it's treasure you found, but didn't decide

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
to split up amongst yourself. And physically

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000
how are we toting all this about with our 100

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
pounds of beef jerky? It's in your closet, in your

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
farm. Okay. So we have a home base.

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000
Oh, but the beef jerky is in a magical bag

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000
of holding. It doesn't... You don't have to...

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
Oh, could this all be in the bag of holding? Sure,

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000
yeah. All right. So we have all

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000
this. So we have

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000
18 gold pieces, including something else.

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000
This is the real D&D, man.

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
Not all this fucking like

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000
these and vows. Yeah. It's just pretty

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000
what's in my bag. It's just

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
just inventory, man. Yeah. We have

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
Masterwork leather armor. I like that.

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000
We've got... Also off the Assassin. We've got more

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000
gold pieces. We've got a bag of holding. We've got

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000
beef jerky. We've got... What's

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000
SP? SP's silver pieces. They're like

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000
dimes. Gotcha.

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
And two more religious relics.

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
Right. Okay. And then what

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000
do those look like? Describe the religious

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000
relics. They're statues of

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000
gods, like of

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
Pelor. Icons, yeah. Yeah.

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000
Okay. All right.

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000
I guess not Pelor. Whatever. It's Pelor.

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000
Okay. Well,

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
I picked my spell load

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000
out. Haha.

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
Spell cards.

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000
I love this card system. I think it's good.

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000
Read what you picked.

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000
So we get...

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000
How many are we have every day?

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000
Six? Six right now until you level up.

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000
Yeah. Okay. So we have six and then we get to pick

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000
how many more? Well, you get

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000
your can trips and your bonus

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000
spells from your circle and your domain.

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
All right. This is all esoteric.

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
I'm into

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000
this kind of paperwork shit. I love this. I know

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000
you guys are. The cards are helpful to me.

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
I really was hoping

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
they'd be helpful. All right. So Dan, read

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
what you picked. So let's

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
let everybody know what...

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
Well, the spells I have automatically...

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
Our light

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000
guidance.

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000
It's guidance. You touch one willing

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000
creature once before the spell ends.

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000
The target can roll a d4 and add

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000
the number roll to one ability check of its

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000
choice. A bonus is an action.

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
A little buffy thing.

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000
Sacred Flame.

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000
That's like an attack.

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000
Burning Hands.

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000
That's classic. We know that one.

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000
Players Handbook.

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000
Fairy Fire.

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000
The...

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000
What's Fairy Fire?

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000
It puts magical lights

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
around someone who's invisible or dimly

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
lit and it makes them easier to hit.

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000
Scorching Ray.

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000
Blast some fire

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000
missiles. That's going to see some mileage.

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000
So

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000
then those are all the ones that I have

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000
regardless.

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000
And then I chose

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000
as my level one spells

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
of which I get four.

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000
Creator Destroy Water. Detect Magic.

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000
Inflict Wounds.

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
And Cure Wounds.

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000
And as my level two spells

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000
of which I get two, I chose Zone of Truth.

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000
You create a magical zone

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000
that guards against deception and a 15 foot radius.

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000
Blah, blah, blah.

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000
It's like an old person.

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000
It's like a paralysis thing.

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000
Yeah, it paralyzes a dude.

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
Booyah.

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000
Booyah.

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
Cody's doctor's name.

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000
She thought her doctor's name.

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000
She had a physical.

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.000
She's got a clean mammogram today.

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.000
I think we celebrate that.

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000
Goddamn.

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000
They got to get their boobies mushed.

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000
By a cold thing.

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000
I can't believe how painful that looks.

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000
Like, they don't do that

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000
to your

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000
dick balls.

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000
Or them.

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000
That is insane.

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000
But anyways, she's all clear.

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000
And

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000
she thought her doctor's name was

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000
Bunani.

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000
But it's like

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000
Bunini or something.

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000
You were thinking of Bunani.

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000
Anyways, alright.

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000
She's been calling her doctor

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000
for a while.

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000
In Iceland, the mammogram machines are warmed.

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000
So they're not ice cold.

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.000
I think it still mashes your tits.

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000
It does.

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000
That's got to be the worst part.

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000
Yeah.

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.000
Alright.

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000
Those precious boobies.

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000
Number one killer of women, Jeff.

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000
Boobs?

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000
I had drinks with Heather Anne Campbell

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000
who just survived.

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000
Yeah.

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.000
If you don't know who Heather Anne Campbell is,

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000
she's one of our favorite comedians.

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000
She should come on the show.

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.000
We were on

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000
At Midnight, Chris Hardwick's show with her.

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000
She's an improv friend

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000
of Jeff's.

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
She's a spectacular person.

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000
It was great having drinks with her.

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000
She's writing on that Twilight Zone

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000
Jordan Piedle.

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000
Twilight Zone show now.

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000
We just wrapped.

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000
I wanted her on Rick and Morty

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000
but Twilight Zone just got

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000
their hook center.

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.000
But we talked about video games

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000
and

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.000
her survival of this

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000
fucking thing that also our other

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000
friend Angela Trimber,

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:21.000
which I didn't even know until I talked to Heather,

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.000
I was like, oh shit, I didn't follow Angela

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.000
on Instagram.

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000
And then I saw Angela

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000
at a party

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.000
two nights ago.

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.000
And I was like,

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.000
it's crazy how little time

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000
it takes between diagnosis

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:39.000
and

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.000
you're either fucked or it's over.

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.000
It's like

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000
depending on the process and stuff,

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000
it's like for Heather, it was like

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000
she

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000
got this

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.000
result that was like, you're in the

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.000
crosshairs of God and then it was like

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:57.000
a month and a half later, you're like,

01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:59.000
you're done with this.

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000
It's just like how quickly

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000
that happens.

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.000
It's like a bus just coming out of nowhere

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.000
and it either kills you or it just

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000
wings you.

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000
All right, anyways.

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.000
Well, let's give it up for Heather

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:15.000
for making it through that.

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.000
She's a fucking hero.

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.000
I was only on one at

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.000
midnight and it was with you and Heather

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:23.000
and I had more fun doing that than any other

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000
half hour taping of my life because

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000
we left our asses off the entire

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000
time. We did two of them. I did one.

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000
That sounds right.

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000
We did two. It was you, me, and Brandon.

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.000
It was the other one, right?

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.000
I only did one with you and Heather.

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000
Oh, okay.

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.000
All right.

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000
Wow.

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000
I mean, how do we

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000
continue after that?

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.000
We don't.

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.000
Pack it in.

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.000
What time is it? It's 10.

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000
Okay.

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:57.000
Do a wrap.

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.000
All right.

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.000
Zach, you got a beat?

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.000
Let's give it up for Zac McKeever up there

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000
who has always the grooviest.

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:07.000
The audio guy.

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:09.000
Thank you, Zach.

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.000
Yo.

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.000
Yo.

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.000
Yo.

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000
The song's about eating your pussy.

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000
Yo.

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:21.000
Yo.

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000
I guess it's not.

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.000
It didn't go over well.

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.000
The song's about

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000
eating pussy.

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000
But not yours.

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000
Someone else's.

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000
Yo.

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000
I ate someone else's pussy the other day.

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.000
I ate it in the most unusual way.

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000
I ate it like it was

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.000
corn on the cob.

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000
I'm a pussy eating Cajun

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.000
and snob.

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.000
I like my spices and my pussy.

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.000
I like to...

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:57.000
Nothing rhymes with pussy.

01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:59.000
I elected

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:01.000
going to boat and on the bayou.

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.000
Yo.

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.000
I grew up on the bayou.

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.000
I want to defy you

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.000
by taking you out

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.000
and

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.000
I'm going to shout in public

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:15.000
in a restaurant

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000
that you already like, but then you won't be

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.000
allowed there anymore

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.000
because you came with a guy that started shouting.

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.000
My name is

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:27.000
F.C. Stugatz.

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:29.000
Stugatz.

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.000
Wait.

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.000
What's your name?

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:35.000
My name is F.C. Stugatz.

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:37.000
It's a real guy.

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:39.000
It is? Yeah.

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.000
I think it's a Miami sports commentator.

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.000
I'll come up with a different one.

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.000
There's also the name of the boat.

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.000
My name is M.C. John Smith.

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:51.000
I'm here with

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:53.000
M.C. John Johnson.

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:55.000
Hello.

01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.000
How are you today?

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.000
Oh, I'm feeling the usual way.

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.000
Yo, John Johnson.

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.000
Yes, John Smith.

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.000
What do you want to do with your width?

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.000
I want to lose some of it.

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000
Oh, are you feeling insecure about it?

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.000
Yes.

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:15.000
I'd like to reduce my carbs.

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:17.000
Oh, shit.

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.000
Let's go on the yard.

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:21.000
By the way, we live in prison.

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.000
Yo.

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.000
I'm going to lift these weights.

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:29.000
Hey, I'm going to eat these grapes.

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.000
Hey, you get grapes in prison?

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000
Yeah.

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000
Who do you know?

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000
I know Joe.

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.000
I know Joe Schwartz.

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:45.000
Come over here.

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:47.000
Hi, my name is Joe Schwartz.

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.000
Joe Schwartz.

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:51.000
This is John Johnson.

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:53.000
Hello, I'm John Johnson.

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:55.000
And you know me.

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:57.000
I'm John Smith.

01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:59.000
Of course I know you.

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:01.000
I'm Joe Schwartz.

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:03.000
Hey, let's walk around the yard.

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:05.000
This is our prison yard.

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:07.000
Strut, strut, eating some grapes.

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:09.000
Hey, get your hands off my grapes.

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:11.000
Thank you all for coming.

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.000
All right, yeah.

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.000
I mean, it's not a good show.

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.000
No, it's a terrible show.

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.000
I think twice about coming next time.

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.000
Yeah, I think twice.

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.000
Let's give it up for Steve Levy, everybody.

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000
Zach, thank you for the music.

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:29.000
Let's give it up for Spencer Crittenden.

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000
I'm Jeff Davis, your Comptroller.

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:33.000
Mayor, as always.

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:35.000
Jen Harmon.

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:37.000
Thank you all. Drive fast.

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:39.000
Take chances.

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:57.000
Did you get any of that?

01:57:57.000 --> 01:58:07.000
It's a good show.
