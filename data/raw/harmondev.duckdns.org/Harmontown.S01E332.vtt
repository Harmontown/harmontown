movie?\n\n03:39.600 --> 03:47.120\nUh, you got, I mean, the first five minutes is like worth $30.\n\n03:47.120 --> 03:54.720\nI was, I was drunk granted, but like, I, I was like, like crying, not just from laughing,\n\n03:54.720 --> 04:01.360\nbut also like emotion, like, like, like there's this like opening where the, where it's like\n\n04:01.360 --> 04:06.360\nthe origin of Sherlock Holmes meeting Watson and like, it's, it's, I can't even remember\n\n04:06.360 --> 04:08.480\nthe details, I just, I was like shrieking, laughing.\n\n04:08.480 --> 04:10.080\nIs this the Robert Downey Jr. kind of thing?\n\n04:10.080 --> 04:15.680\nNo, no, this is the Will Ferrell, uh, uh, yeah, it, it, it then, it's just like after,\n\n04:15.680 --> 04:21.360\nit's like the first five minutes, like deserves an Academy Award for like a comedic opening\n\n04:21.360 --> 04:23.640\nabout, about a Sherlock Holmes movie.\n\n04:23.640 --> 04:27.800\nIt's just like, it's, it's, it's such a great, it promises so much.\n\n04:27.800 --> 04:29.160\nI don't know what happened.\n\n04:29.160 --> 04:30.160\nWho knows.\n\n04:30.160 --> 04:31.160\nI didn't even look at the credits.\n\n04:31.160 --> 04:32.160\nI don't, is that an Adam and Kay movie?\n\n04:32.160 --> 04:33.160\nI don't know.\n\n04:33.160 --> 04:34.160\nIt probably is.\n\n04:34.160 --> 04:35.160\nYeah.\n\n04:35.160 --> 04:36.160\nCause it's the Gary Sanchez title card.\n\n04:36.160 --> 04:38.160\nUh, but yeah, I don't know.\n\n04:38.160 --> 04:39.160\nI don't know.\n\n04:39.160 --> 04:44.240\nI'm such a fan of that, of that circle, I don't even, I just want to focus on what's\n\n04:44.240 --> 04:45.240\ngood.\n\n04:45.240 --> 04:46.240\nI don't want to, I don't want to.\n\n04:46.240 --> 04:47.240\nDid you watch the whole thing?\n\n04:47.240 --> 04:48.240\nYeah.\n\n04:48.240 --> 04:49.240\nWell, no, we actually stopped.\n\n04:49.240 --> 04:55.560\nI mean, that is really, I, I, I, I have enough respect for that camp that I'm, I, I assume\n\n04:55.560 --> 04:59.440\nthey will not be offended, but they, they must know that that, that something happened\n\n04:59.440 --> 05:04.160\nthere and the stinker got made, but, but I do, I, I just, I don't want to be a snoot\n\n05:04.160 --> 05:05.160\nabout it.\n\n05:05.160 --> 05:10.000\nI just want to say, holy shit, best first five minutes of a fucking Sherlock Holmes story\n\n05:10.000 --> 05:11.000\never.\n\n05:11.000 --> 05:12.000\nIt's so, it's so cool.\n\n05:12.000 --> 05:14.000\nSo if I'm on a plane, I'll just pop that in and watch the cold open.\n\n05:14.000 --> 05:15.000\nIt's so worth it, man.\n\n05:15.000 --> 05:20.560\nI would almost, almost argue that it's worth like the whatever it costs on Apple TV, certainly\n\n05:20.560 --> 05:24.000\nthe rental, rent it for the 3.99 or whatever it is.\n\n05:24.000 --> 05:25.000\nMaybe don't buy it.\n\n05:25.000 --> 05:26.000\nYou're a millennial.\n\n05:26.000 --> 05:28.600\nYou've, you've got enough problems.\n\n05:28.600 --> 05:38.200\nThere Vice's article about how you ever see that porn genre, the, what's it called detective?\n\n05:38.200 --> 05:39.200\nThe rent is due.\n\n05:39.200 --> 05:40.200\nWhat's it called?\n\n05:40.200 --> 05:46.840\nIt's like a property, property bros or no, it's pro, it's like property, something,\n\n05:46.840 --> 05:51.880\nproperty sluts or property, sorry ladies.\n\n05:51.880 --> 05:52.880\nProperty sex workers.\n\n05:52.880 --> 05:58.040\nNo, it's, it's, it's, it's property, yeah, property, something, something like that.\n\n05:58.040 --> 06:02.600\nIt's like the vice angle on it was millennials have a new genre of porn based on how broke\n\n06:02.600 --> 06:08.640\nthey are because it's just people, it's like people either taking advantage of desperate\n\n06:08.640 --> 06:09.640\nrealtors.\n\n06:09.640 --> 06:13.520\nIt's all fictional, of course, but where it's like tenants that are getting evicted in it.\n\n06:13.520 --> 06:18.360\nIt's just sort of like it's a genre of porn about encroaching poverty.\n\n06:18.360 --> 06:23.080\nLay Ms. porn.\n\n06:23.080 --> 06:25.480\nI've, I've, I've, I've watched several.\n\n06:25.480 --> 06:26.480\nSure.\n\n06:26.480 --> 06:30.520\nDid we ever talk about me getting into strap on porn?\n\n06:30.520 --> 06:31.520\nNo.\n\n06:31.520 --> 06:35.920\nI feel like we, no, I, I, no, no, I think we've kind of breezed over that sometimes.\n\n06:35.920 --> 06:36.920\nRight.\n\n06:36.920 --> 06:37.920\nThere was sort of a rush.\n\n06:37.920 --> 06:43.120\nThere's like, it's, it's, it's really because of the high definition, like it's girl on\n\n06:43.120 --> 06:49.760\ngirl and it's like, I think it's like Russian or something and like they, but they wear\n\n06:49.760 --> 06:54.360\na lot of pantyhose and I'm like, I have a fetish in that, that area.\n\n06:54.360 --> 07:00.200\nBut then it's like they use the pantyhose to like hold in a strap on.\n\n07:00.200 --> 07:01.200\nIt's not a strap on.\n\n07:01.200 --> 07:05.600\nIt's called, it's called strapless dildo action.\n\n07:05.600 --> 07:06.600\nHow does it attach?\n\n07:06.600 --> 07:07.600\nBros.\n\n07:07.600 --> 07:09.600\nHow does it stay attached?\n\n07:09.600 --> 07:12.680\nWhat do they, they, they tie up, they tie some hose around the edge of the dildo.\n\n07:12.680 --> 07:16.280\nThey kind of like, I think, I think there's a thing called field does.\n\n07:16.280 --> 07:17.280\nSure.\n\n07:17.280 --> 07:18.280\nRing a bell.\n\n07:18.280 --> 07:19.280\nOf course.\n\n07:19.280 --> 07:20.920\nBecause there's, it's not strapped on.\n\n07:20.920 --> 07:23.880\nIt's actually, there's, it's inserted on the other, on the host side.\n\n07:23.880 --> 07:26.240\nIt's a double dildo.\n\n07:26.240 --> 07:29.120\nSuch so that you're feeling it as you're using it.\n\n07:29.120 --> 07:33.680\nSo it's not, you know, it's, I think it more passes the Beck Deltest as a strap, as a,\n\n07:33.680 --> 07:38.640\nas a, as a girl on girl, like a penetrative instrument.\n\n07:38.640 --> 07:43.040\nIt's more like, hey, this is, this isn't just about pretending there's a dick here.\n\n07:43.040 --> 07:45.240\nThis is like, this is about feeling good.\n\n07:45.240 --> 07:46.240\nOh man.\n\n07:46.240 --> 07:47.240\nRob Schrab everybody.\n\n07:47.240 --> 07:54.240\nOh yeah.\n\n07:54.240 --> 07:57.240\nHey Rob.\n\n07:57.240 --> 07:58.240\nHello Jeff.\n\n07:58.240 --> 08:01.520\nRob, you've got a mysterious package in your lap there.\n\n08:01.520 --> 08:03.520\nIt's a field dough.\n\n08:03.520 --> 08:04.520\nYes.\n\n08:04.520 --> 08:05.520\nNo.\n\n08:05.520 --> 08:11.560\nIt is, it is, that, that could be the exact size of a box for, for a large, a large sex\n\n08:11.560 --> 08:12.560\ntoy.\n\n08:12.560 --> 08:17.840\nIt's like, hey, stuff of what Dan was saying, I thought, there's an opening, man.\n\n08:17.840 --> 08:18.840\nI'm going to go for it.\n\n08:18.840 --> 08:19.840\nAn opening.\n\n08:19.840 --> 08:20.840\nGet it?\n\n08:20.840 --> 08:21.840\nAll right.\n\n08:21.840 --> 08:22.840\nYeah.\n\n08:22.840 --> 08:23.840\nWell, we got a guest tonight.\n\n08:23.840 --> 08:24.840\nSo, okay.\n\n08:24.840 --> 08:25.840\nIf you're going to do this.\n\n08:25.840 --> 08:26.840\nDo you want to explain what this is?\n\n08:26.840 --> 08:34.120\nIs it a box that you showed me in the, I guess we should start with our text conversation.\n\n08:34.120 --> 08:41.680\nBecause you're, it's important for me to let people know what an asshole you are.\n\n08:41.680 --> 08:50.120\nYou know, some of you may know that Rob, I coat, my, my fiance took a pretty nice photo\n\n08:50.120 --> 08:54.600\nof me at a hotel in Pasadena, looking handsome and happy.\n\n08:54.600 --> 08:58.800\nIs there any way we could put it up on, on the screen?\n\n08:58.800 --> 08:59.800\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n08:59.800 --> 09:00.800\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n09:00.800 --> 09:01.800\nNo.\n\n09:01.800 --> 09:04.360\nI think the audience would like to know what you're talking about.\n\n09:04.360 --> 09:05.360\nWoo.\n\n09:05.360 --> 09:06.860\nIs there any way?\n\n09:06.860 --> 09:10.680\nChris is our way to put that image up on the, if we thought of that before, there definitely\n\n09:10.680 --> 09:11.680\nwould have been a way.\n\n09:11.680 --> 09:12.680\nJumbotron?\n\n09:12.680 --> 09:13.680\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n09:13.680 --> 09:14.680\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n09:14.680 --> 09:15.680\nIt's a podcast.\n\n09:15.680 --> 09:18.440\nI've given up on the visuals.\n\n09:18.440 --> 09:22.600\nI've given up on a lot of things and I had a rare moment of happiness at a hotel in Pasadena.\n\n09:22.600 --> 09:27.280\nCody captured it and I was looking very handsome and she called me a snack.\n\n09:27.280 --> 09:28.280\nRight.\n\n09:28.280 --> 09:32.800\nWhich is a, which is a reference used by the, the boys from Hollywood Handbook, who I believe\n\n09:32.800 --> 09:35.360\nare going to be guesting on the show next week.\n\n09:35.360 --> 09:36.360\nOh.\n\n09:36.360 --> 09:37.360\nExcited.\n\n09:37.360 --> 09:38.360\nWow.\n\n09:38.360 --> 09:39.560\nI think so.\n\n09:39.560 --> 09:43.280\nAnd so Cody, yeah, it was nice.\n\n09:43.280 --> 09:51.640\nAnd then Rob took the photo and he used, like in his very juvenile, you know, color marker\n\n09:51.640 --> 09:52.640\nway.\n\n09:52.640 --> 09:59.760\nHe put lipstick and eye makeup and a ponytail and a purse on me and, and breasts.\n\n09:59.760 --> 10:04.040\nBut the purse was so crudely drawn that he had to write the word purse on an arrow pointing\n\n10:04.040 --> 10:05.040\nto the purse.\n\n10:05.040 --> 10:06.040\nYeah.\n\n10:06.040 --> 10:07.040\nI was using my finger.\n\n10:07.040 --> 10:08.040\nYeah.\n\n10:08.040 --> 10:10.880\nI couldn't tell from the lettering.\n\n10:10.880 --> 10:12.400\nI thought you had a special stylus.\n\n10:12.400 --> 10:16.560\nI was sure you were using a Cintiq tablet.\n\n10:16.560 --> 10:17.560\nNo.\n\n10:17.560 --> 10:26.120\nHe used his fucking ape finger and his dumb old man phone probably has the, the disability\n\n10:26.120 --> 10:33.320\nsettings on Zoom so he can read text from his long suffering life.\n\n10:33.320 --> 10:40.040\nCan't please continue then what happened?\n\n10:40.040 --> 10:43.520\nSo he made this photo and then he put it and then he, and then he immediately started selling\n\n10:43.520 --> 10:49.600\nit on a t-shirt called Dan Harmon and his purse t-shirt.\n\n10:49.600 --> 10:56.480\nIf you, if you have a phone, if you have a phone, maybe take a second to go to my Instagram\n\n10:56.480 --> 11:00.840\nRob Schrab and just see what we're talking about since we can't have, have this.\n\n11:00.840 --> 11:07.400\nAnd if you want to buy a t-shirt, go ahead because it's, it's, it's going down.\n\n11:07.400 --> 11:09.440\nIt's only up for another 24 hours.\n\n11:09.440 --> 11:10.440\nOh wow.\n\n11:10.440 --> 11:13.400\nYou only have another 24 hours to own this piece of history.\n\n11:13.400 --> 11:14.880\nYou could actually, you could actually sue him, Dan.\n\n11:14.880 --> 11:18.760\nYou know, people aren't allowed to profit off of your image without your consent.\n\n11:18.760 --> 11:20.000\nHe won't do it.\n\n11:20.000 --> 11:29.280\nSo today at 6.44 p.m. he texted me, I deserve a ride to the show tonight.\n\n11:29.280 --> 11:33.840\nAnd I said, you mocked me online in front of the dozens to three dozen people that follow\n\n11:33.840 --> 11:36.280\nyou.\n\n11:36.280 --> 11:40.320\nAnd he said, sold 25 shirts.\n\n11:40.320 --> 11:44.480\nAnd I said, undercut a decade of work toward gender equality.\n\n11:44.480 --> 11:46.760\nAnd he said, you're welcome.\n\n11:46.760 --> 11:49.640\nAnd he said, Cody and Kate, he did it.\n\n11:49.640 --> 11:52.120\nI'll be out front at 7.30.\n\n11:52.120 --> 11:57.640\nAnd I said, parentheses, hearted.\n\n11:57.640 --> 11:59.360\nHe meant to say hearted.\n\n11:59.360 --> 12:00.840\nThey heated it.\n\n12:00.840 --> 12:02.560\nNo, I didn't.\n\n12:02.560 --> 12:08.600\nWhat did they heat it with, fucking, shut up, stupid.\n\n12:08.600 --> 12:15.960\nSo, and then he got in the car at 7.30 and with this box and it says, it's from Mike\n\n12:15.960 --> 12:17.400\nCravello's world.\n\n12:17.400 --> 12:18.400\nYes.\n\n12:18.400 --> 12:24.400\nWhich is a camera shop in Milwaukee celebrating their 50th anniversary this year.\n\n12:24.400 --> 12:27.800\nAnd if you know us, you know that we love the song, that there's a great local ad that\n\n12:27.800 --> 12:31.000\nhave a wonderful jingle that we adore.\n\n12:31.000 --> 12:36.600\nWhen you're thinking cameras, there's a world of things to see.\n\n12:36.600 --> 12:44.200\nWe've got a choice from a wide selection of the highest quality and the staff of professional\n\n12:44.200 --> 12:48.360\npeople dedicated to serving you.\n\n12:48.360 --> 12:54.680\nSo when you're thinking cameras, one place stands alone.\n\n12:54.680 --> 13:00.760\nMike Cravello's world has got that extra something, a service and quality.\n\n13:00.760 --> 13:10.960\nA warm and friendly world, reflecting our lives through photography.\n\n13:10.960 --> 13:17.520\nMike Cravello's world is a wonderful world of cameras.\n\n13:17.520 --> 13:22.680\nMike Cravello's world is a wonderful world of cameras.\n\n13:22.680 --> 13:25.600\nHappy 50th anniversary.\n\n13:25.600 --> 13:30.600\nMy parents worked in the film industry in Milwaukee.\n\n13:30.600 --> 13:38.400\nAnd by that, I mean, my dad kind of mopped floors at this place where they had chemical\n\n13:38.400 --> 13:43.200\nvats and they would process film and my mom spliced stuff.\n\n13:43.200 --> 13:48.640\nMy dad kind of worked his way up to sales and things.\n\n13:48.640 --> 13:55.480\nBut a place called Kluge Communications, I think it was called.\n\n13:55.480 --> 13:58.600\nAnd that's where my parents worked.\n\n13:58.600 --> 14:01.720\nAnd so they would go to Mike Cravello's Christmas party.\n\n14:01.720 --> 14:09.560\nIt was kind of like a who's who of Milwaukee's film community kind of thing.\n\n14:09.560 --> 14:11.280\nOh, the fucking happened there.\n\n14:11.280 --> 14:16.000\nI just really does seem, I remember my parents coming home and going, whoa, that Mike Cravello's\n\n14:16.000 --> 14:17.960\nworld is fucking crazy.\n\n14:17.960 --> 14:19.360\nI was like, what do you mean?\n\n14:19.360 --> 14:22.720\nThey're like ice sculptures and there was a live python.\n\n14:22.720 --> 14:25.840\nIt just sounded very fondue orgy.\n\n14:25.840 --> 14:30.080\nI always pictured Mike Cravello as like this Robert Evans.\n\n14:30.080 --> 14:33.960\nAnyways, his world is a wonderful world of cameras.\n\n14:33.960 --> 14:34.960\nWonderful world of cameras.\n\n14:34.960 --> 14:39.200\nAnyway, on my way back from Atlanta, where I was shooting Creepshow, which is coming\n\n14:39.200 --> 14:49.280\nto Shutter this fall, I stopped home in Milwaukee and went to dinner with my family.\n\n14:49.280 --> 14:54.600\nAnd on the way, Mike Cravello's was there and I said, I got fucking good at Mike Cravello's.\n\n14:54.600 --> 14:59.520\nI walked in, talked it, chatted up with the with the team.\n\n14:59.520 --> 15:02.680\nThey showed me around, showed me behind the scenes.\n\n15:02.680 --> 15:05.880\nThey seem like they're dedicated to serving you.\n\n15:05.880 --> 15:08.960\nYeah, they were dedicated.\n\n15:08.960 --> 15:18.120\nAnd this afternoon when I came home, this box was waiting for me from Mike Cravello's.\n\n15:18.120 --> 15:20.880\nAnd I haven't opened it up yet.\n\n15:20.880 --> 15:31.840\nAnd to bring some showmanship to this show, this dead elephant, this snog, to bring it\n\n15:31.840 --> 15:36.080\nback to entertain some of these people for once.\n\n15:36.080 --> 15:50.720\nI'm going to open what slog snog snog like the British slang for kissing.\n\n15:50.720 --> 16:02.880\nI'm going to open this box on live podcast, okay, well, you know, so fucking mics are\n\n16:02.880 --> 16:13.960\nexpensive, man.\n\n16:13.960 --> 16:17.520\nSo Robert's having a little difficulty with the tape.\n\n16:17.520 --> 16:18.520\nI don't think he's trying.\n\n16:18.520 --> 16:19.520\nYou know, you're building a suspense.\n\n16:19.520 --> 16:23.880\nYeah, you're like, you're like, like Johnny Carson, like Karnak, opening the envelope,\n\n16:23.880 --> 16:32.800\nyou know, we got a, we lost a, you're not even trying.\n\n16:32.800 --> 16:34.920\nYou want me to procure you like a blade or something like that?\n\n16:34.920 --> 16:36.560\nIt sounds like he doesn't want that.\n\n16:36.560 --> 16:37.560\nOkay.\n\n16:37.560 --> 16:38.560\nYou got enough to pull now.\n\n16:38.560 --> 16:39.560\nYou got enough to pull.\n\n16:39.560 --> 16:40.560\nAll right.\n\n16:40.560 --> 16:45.560\nThat's piece of tape never won.\n\n16:45.560 --> 16:50.160\nWhen you're sinking cameras, there's a world of things to see.\n\n16:50.160 --> 16:53.680\nI told her, I guess, you know, we usually talk for 10 minutes and then I'll bring you\n\n16:53.680 --> 16:54.680\nout.\n\n16:54.680 --> 16:57.280\nOh, there's no, there's no clock.\n\n16:57.280 --> 17:00.920\nDid you ever fight with somebody?\n\n17:00.920 --> 17:05.360\nMy dad sued my mom for twenty thousand dollars.\n\n17:05.360 --> 17:07.120\nAre you sure you're allowed to talk about this in front of people?\n\n17:07.120 --> 17:08.120\nI don't care.\n\n17:08.120 --> 17:11.120\nI hope they both die.\n\n17:11.120 --> 17:17.360\nOh, no, but when my parents split up, my dad, like, I don't think this is going to follow\n\n17:17.360 --> 17:18.360\nthat.\n\n17:18.360 --> 17:23.120\nSo yeah, I'm going to open this a little quicker and we can get back to save that story.\n\n17:23.120 --> 17:27.720\nLet's put a bit in that because you're going to go and I hate each other and I've never\n\n17:27.720 --> 17:33.560\ndone it and they used to beat me on Christmas, I'm going to go, it's a napkin.\n\n17:33.560 --> 17:37.240\nThat sounds like the best possible way things could go.\n\n17:37.240 --> 17:44.880\nWell, I could eulogize John Singleton, Generation X legend, who's taken from us way too early\n\n17:44.880 --> 17:47.080\ntoday at the age of 51.\n\n17:47.080 --> 17:53.120\nI guess he had a stroke in April and his family had to make a terrible decision today to take\n\n17:53.120 --> 17:55.200\nhim off life support.\n\n17:55.200 --> 18:00.800\nHe was the youngest director ever in the history of the Academy Awards to be nominated.\n\n18:00.800 --> 18:04.720\nI thought it was 24 with boys in the hood, but maybe he was 24 when he got nominated.\n\n18:04.720 --> 18:06.200\nI don't know, maybe he was 23 when he made it.\n\n18:06.200 --> 18:08.400\nBut at least you've stopped to correct me.\n\n18:08.400 --> 18:09.400\nKeep going.\n\n18:09.400 --> 18:12.400\nWell, it's probably important to people who keep track of these fucking records.\n\n18:12.400 --> 18:16.000\nWhich I read online, 23.\n\n18:16.000 --> 18:20.600\nAlso the first African-American to be nominated in that category, but we don't see race at\n\n18:20.600 --> 18:22.040\nHarmontown.\n\n18:22.040 --> 18:23.400\nWe only see youth.\n\n18:23.400 --> 18:26.200\nWhich is the only thing that matters to us.\n\n18:26.200 --> 18:46.080\nOh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, it's a sign.\n\n18:46.080 --> 18:48.080\nWrapped in plastic.\n\n18:48.080 --> 18:51.560\nAre you fucking kidding me?\n\n18:51.560 --> 18:53.600\nGet out of plastic.\n\n18:53.600 --> 18:57.720\nThey couldn't find a smaller box for that?\n\n18:57.720 --> 19:00.680\nIt's two signs.\n\n19:00.680 --> 19:01.680\nWhat a day.\n\n19:01.680 --> 19:05.680\nOne for me and one for Spencer.\n\n19:05.680 --> 19:06.680\nOh.\n\n19:06.680 --> 19:07.680\nYes.\n\n19:07.680 --> 19:08.680\nCan we come over here?\n\n19:08.680 --> 19:09.680\nCan we come in here?\n\n19:09.680 --> 19:14.680\nCan we take all three ads and fill in the NASCAR, would you put, like, one?\n\n19:14.680 --> 19:15.680\nYeah, that's good.\n\n19:15.680 --> 19:20.880\nJust hold it like that for however long he talks.\n\n19:20.880 --> 19:23.400\nThere's nothing else in that box like maybe a camera.\n\n19:23.400 --> 19:24.400\nIs there a letter?\n\n19:24.400 --> 19:26.720\nLook, yeah, look, keep looking at the car.\n\n19:26.720 --> 19:27.720\nI'm looking.\n\n19:27.720 --> 19:28.720\nIt looks empty.\n\n19:28.720 --> 19:29.720\nThat's empty.\n\n19:29.720 --> 19:31.920\nIt's pretty empty.\n\n19:31.920 --> 19:35.320\nSo he just gave you advertising.\n\n19:35.320 --> 19:39.680\nThat's great as a forest of trees died for that box.\n\n19:39.680 --> 19:42.280\nYou could definitely have put these in an envelope.\n\n19:42.280 --> 19:46.520\nThese are a forest.\n\n19:46.520 --> 19:47.520\nThere you go.\n\n19:47.520 --> 19:48.520\nThere we go.\n\n19:48.520 --> 19:51.120\nBig logo.\n\n19:51.120 --> 19:56.520\nI think John Singleton was 23.\n\n19:56.520 --> 19:59.120\nYeah, that's what I read, too.\n\n19:59.120 --> 20:04.920\nI don't know why he's got his head up his ass all the time.\n\n20:04.920 --> 20:09.520\nYou got a couple of years, I'll explain it to you.\n\n20:09.520 --> 20:10.520\nOkay.\n\n20:10.520 --> 20:15.240\nWell, our first guest.\n\n20:15.240 --> 20:30.640\nOur next guest is a self-made internet curator of mirth and frivolity.\n\n20:30.640 --> 20:37.400\nHe's the founder of Overheard in LA, which is an Instagram that's majorly followed.\n\n20:37.400 --> 20:43.200\nHe went on to become the founder of many franchises to Thingamabobs that sprung out from that,\n\n20:43.200 --> 20:47.880\nbut made himself out of dirt without permission, just like somebody I know named Dan Harmon.\n\n20:47.880 --> 20:56.560\nPlease welcome the Dan Harmon of Instagram, Jesse Margolis.\n\n20:56.560 --> 20:57.960\nI'm not that good at introductions.\n\n20:57.960 --> 20:59.960\nI'm sorry, Jesse.\n\n20:59.960 --> 21:03.400\nCome on, move down, Mike.\n\n21:03.400 --> 21:05.680\nWhat's up, Jesse?\n\n21:05.680 --> 21:07.880\nHello.\n\n21:07.880 --> 21:11.360\nThanks for creating Overheard LA.\n\n21:11.360 --> 21:13.560\nWhat's the username if you want to follow it on Instagram?\n\n21:13.560 --> 21:15.160\nIt's Overheard LA.\n\n21:15.160 --> 21:17.360\nIt is Overheard LA.\n\n21:17.360 --> 21:20.720\nWe've got a bunch now, but yeah, that was the first child.\n\n21:20.720 --> 21:26.120\nI commented today, and in the past, I got to retract this now, as I said in my comment\n\n21:26.120 --> 21:29.920\ntoday, because I was like, in the past, I have seen one.\n\n21:29.920 --> 21:33.880\nI guess people have a visceral reaction when they think one is fake.\n\n21:33.880 --> 21:38.000\nFirst of all, let's give a classic example, whether it's your favorite or you just think\n\n21:38.000 --> 21:41.840\nit's like a classic Overheard LA quote.\n\n21:41.840 --> 21:49.720\nI think my all-time favorite is, you can't be vegan in jail.\n\n21:49.720 --> 21:58.760\nI don't know if that's true, but in Yale, I don't know if you can be vegan in Yale.\n\n21:58.760 --> 22:01.720\nThere was one yesterday, but in the past, I remember seeing one, and I can't remember\n\n22:01.720 --> 22:04.760\nwhich one I saw, where I was like, I hate it when they're fake.\n\n22:04.760 --> 22:11.320\nI had this visceral reaction, I feel like my job is to police, like, that one's fake.\n\n22:11.320 --> 22:17.960\nIt comes out of a place of love, because the joy isn't like, oh, this is a hilariously\n\n22:17.960 --> 22:19.760\nwritten thing.\n\n22:19.760 --> 22:25.120\nThe joy isn't really believing that this was genuinely, this was Overheard, and then I\n\n22:25.120 --> 22:31.400\nguess it trips a kind of anger in people that I can attest to when it meets our definition\n\n22:31.400 --> 22:35.200\nof phony or something, or like, this one's fake.\n\n22:35.200 --> 22:41.880\nBut the weird thing is, I'm never doing it again, because I saw one the other day, yesterday,\n\n22:41.880 --> 22:48.000\nit was like a kid on a plane, like a four-year-old on a plane or something, and the kid says,\n\n22:48.000 --> 22:53.480\nAlexa, fly me up into the sky now, is the kid saying that, and everyone's like, this\n\n22:53.480 --> 22:57.360\nis fucking real thing.\n\n22:57.360 --> 23:01.080\nPeople don't, I mean, it was 10 years ago, Jeff said he saw some kid at the airport pinching\n\n23:01.080 --> 23:08.560\nand zooming a magazine cover, like, of course these larvae think that, I think I wrote,\n\n23:08.560 --> 23:11.800\nI'm just surprised the plane didn't shoot up in the air and land like a fucking lawn\n\n23:11.800 --> 23:12.800\ndart.\n\n23:12.800 --> 23:15.000\nJesse, how are they, how is that curated?\n\n23:15.000 --> 23:18.960\nPeople submit them, and then there's a team of people that select the ones that go up\n\n23:18.960 --> 23:20.960\non the grains?\n\n23:20.960 --> 23:27.080\nYes, there's a bipedal Jewish Instagram account sitting right here that goes through it, no,\n\n23:27.080 --> 23:30.800\nwe have a team of people, but in terms of the LA account, I go through it.\n\n23:30.800 --> 23:37.320\nSo we get submissions, you know, we aren't journalists, you know, I don't, and I don't\n\n23:37.320 --> 23:41.240\nknow what that means that's, yeah, I mean, well you can't, because sometimes there was\n\n23:41.240 --> 23:45.520\nanother recent one, for instance, where it was a, no, you have, like, I'm like obsessed\n\n23:45.520 --> 23:50.480\nwith your show, and you have like the canon of a fucking meme account.\n\n23:50.480 --> 23:55.000\nThere was one where there was like a guest talking to a host at a restaurant, and then\n\n23:55.000 --> 23:58.320\npeople were like, that was a really mean thing to say or something like that, and then this\n\n23:58.320 --> 24:03.440\nwill happen a lot, like in the comments, a person who was involved with the quote, which\n\n24:03.440 --> 24:06.880\ndoesn't surprise me, because that's probably a person that submitted or whatever, and they\n\n24:06.880 --> 24:11.680\ngo like, oh, that was me, actually, and the host was my friend, and they were kind of\n\n24:11.680 --> 24:15.680\nrazzing me, but it was like, oh, and then someone overheard it, and it's like, so it's\n\n24:15.680 --> 24:20.960\nboth true, but at the same time, it wasn't like a stranger, like taking the shit out\n\n24:20.960 --> 24:26.000\nof a stranger, as maybe the overheard person thought, but...\n\n24:26.000 --> 24:31.360\nYeah, I think that it kills me, because obviously, when you create something, whether it's a\n\n24:31.360 --> 24:38.520\ngiant television show, or a podcast on stage, or whatever it is, you care about it.\n\n24:38.520 --> 24:42.760\nWe like to call it a snog.\n\n24:42.760 --> 24:51.520\nYou care about it, so I see those comments, and it's a little frustrating, because that's\n\n24:51.520 --> 24:55.980\na sort of white box, and people look at that white box for the last couple of years, those\n\n24:55.980 --> 25:01.080\nwho care enough to follow it, or whatever, and hopefully, they have their own moment\n\n25:01.080 --> 25:02.080\nof imagination.\n\n25:02.080 --> 25:06.000\nThey know the location, they've met some douchebag like that, they've been that douchebag, whatever\n\n25:06.000 --> 25:12.080\nit is, and yeah, the internet is a place for people to get angry, and you know.\n\n25:12.080 --> 25:17.920\nDo you have a filter that you go through, like that you apply, do you see things, that's\n\n25:17.920 --> 25:21.720\nprobably somebody wrote that, that that seems too good to be true, or something like that?\n\n25:21.720 --> 25:27.880\nI do the, I don't know what the word is, where you Google on Twitter, like Google, no you\n\n25:27.880 --> 25:33.240\nlike search on, you search on, yeah, like so basically if anything is too good, or it's\n\n25:33.240 --> 25:37.960\njust too on point, we'll do a Google search, and I'll search on Twitter, which usually\n\n25:37.960 --> 25:44.640\nwhere a lot of great comedians and smart people have been slamming away for the last 10 years,\n\n25:44.640 --> 25:48.280\nand then we'll sort of post something, and I'll do a little browse of the comments.\n\n25:48.280 --> 25:52.040\nI know sometimes we've posted stuff, and 20 minutes in, someone will be like, that's\n\n25:52.040 --> 25:56.800\nfrom the Mindy shelf, and I'm like, okay, you know, obviously someone's had a similar\n\n25:56.800 --> 26:01.160\nexperience, or someone's tried to get on the account, so then we just delete it.\n\n26:01.160 --> 26:08.800\nIs there a kind of, on the other end of that spectrum, is there, are there qualities criteria\n\n26:08.800 --> 26:14.520\nthat make for a particularly LA-ish quote, or you know, like someone's like, oh, now\n\n26:14.520 --> 26:16.920\nthat's an overheard LA gem.\n\n26:16.920 --> 26:21.160\nYeah, I mean, the problem with LA is it can be so magical, like I don't know if you're\n\n26:21.160 --> 26:27.080\nfamiliar with Cafe Gratitude, I'm sure you're there daily, but it's a restaurant you go\n\n26:27.080 --> 26:30.640\nto, and you sort of, you know, have to like, you know, say this mantra while you order\n\n26:30.640 --> 26:32.840\nyour like vegan slop.\n\n26:32.840 --> 26:37.800\nAnd they write stuff, it's a very Pete Holmes, the restaurant, I think Pete Holmes loves\n\n26:37.800 --> 26:38.800\nit.\n\n26:38.800 --> 26:42.320\nAnd the names of the foods are all kind of like, I am Pete Murphy or something.\n\n26:42.320 --> 26:47.280\nAnd, you know, Sparkle Joy, but like, it's very similar to Kendrick Lamar's, you know,\n\n26:47.280 --> 26:51.440\nAlbum Damn, you know, like Humble and Love and stuff like that.\n\n26:51.440 --> 26:57.480\nSo, you know, I mean, there's specific things where, you know, it's the cocaine and the\n\n26:57.480 --> 26:59.920\nvegans and the absurd.\n\n26:59.920 --> 27:05.160\nIt's that blend of self-care, it's self-loathing, self-obsession, like all the selfs, that's\n\n27:05.160 --> 27:06.160\nthe LA thing.\n\n27:06.160 --> 27:09.800\nIt's like, it's like, it's like people, people believing that, I mean, it's like the same\n\n27:09.800 --> 27:14.240\npeople talking about yoga, you know, who did ketamine last night kind of thing.\n\n27:14.240 --> 27:15.240\nYeah.\n\n27:15.240 --> 27:16.240\nYeah, or Yoda.\n\n27:16.240 --> 27:17.240\nYeah.\n\n27:17.240 --> 27:21.520\nSo, hopefully it's something that, you know, is relatable in the worst or the best way,\n\n27:21.520 --> 27:22.920\nbut isn't so tropey.\n\n27:22.920 --> 27:27.160\nI think the LA account, like the New York account is sometimes, you know, more interesting\n\n27:27.160 --> 27:29.240\nbecause New York's just a more forgiving place.\n\n27:29.240 --> 27:31.800\nIt's like, you can imagine anything happening in New York.\n\n27:31.800 --> 27:35.840\nYou can imagine someone on the street, you know, trying to give away an espresso machine.\n\n27:35.840 --> 27:36.840\nRight.\n\n27:36.840 --> 27:37.840\nRight.\n\n27:37.840 --> 27:38.840\nWhereas in LA, you're like, no one talks to each other.\n\n27:38.840 --> 27:40.320\nYou know, you're not on the street.\n\n27:40.320 --> 27:41.320\nYeah.\n\n27:41.320 --> 27:46.880\nNew York's got the built-in, there's the blue collar guys that you wouldn't even believe\n\n27:46.880 --> 27:47.880\nexisted in LA.\n\n27:47.880 --> 27:54.040\nLike, you could make one up in New York because it would be like, oh, excuse me, sir, where\n\n27:54.040 --> 27:56.280\ncan I feed my chihuahua?\n\n27:56.280 --> 28:03.600\nAnd then some guy going, lady, I'm gonna eat that fucking thing, I'm lifting a stained\n\n28:03.600 --> 28:04.600\nglass.\n\n28:04.600 --> 28:05.600\nI don't know.\n\n28:05.600 --> 28:07.120\nI've never been to New York.\n\n28:07.120 --> 28:12.840\nYeah, I mean, I worked at the Humane Society of New York and it was very similar to that.\n\n28:12.840 --> 28:18.560\nBut yeah, so in some ways, LA's, you know, it's a harder account to do because, you know,\n\n28:18.560 --> 28:22.280\nyou really want it to be special and there are these tropes because they're true.\n\n28:22.280 --> 28:23.280\nYeah.\n\n28:23.280 --> 28:26.040\nWe should tell the story about the creation of this just for a second.\n\n28:26.040 --> 28:31.840\nIt was like, 2016, you, I mean, is that the right year maybe?\n\n28:31.840 --> 28:34.040\nYeah, it was like late 2015.\n\n28:34.040 --> 28:36.000\nYou really just, as anyone might expect.\n\n28:36.000 --> 28:40.760\nI mean, you just, you're just doing it, doing the thing.\n\n28:40.760 --> 28:42.960\nI mean, it's some shit you overheard yourself personally.\n\n28:42.960 --> 28:45.600\nYeah, well, it started out, it started out, I mean, I don't know if it's interesting or\n\n28:45.600 --> 28:50.760\nnot, but it started off with me being pretty broke and spending a lot of time at Erwan,\n\n28:50.760 --> 28:55.320\nwhich is, you know, the sort of elevated Whole Foods, you know, sort of like Daytime\n\n28:55.320 --> 29:02.240\nNight Club where they sell like $24, you know, sprouted, you know, and it's nowhere backwards,\n\n29:02.240 --> 29:03.240\nman.\n\n29:03.240 --> 29:04.240\nIt's not technically nowhere.\n\n29:04.240 --> 29:05.240\nYeah, it's good that it is.\n\n29:05.240 --> 29:06.240\nI hate to see L.A. more.\n\n29:06.240 --> 29:10.760\nYeah, I gotta take it Erwan, it's really fucking terrible.\n\n29:10.760 --> 29:15.360\nBut I had sort of, someone had made me an Instagram account called ThinJewish, and this\n\n29:15.360 --> 29:19.280\nwas like when Instagram was first starting, and I didn't really know, you know, what Instagram\n\n29:19.280 --> 29:23.960\nwas, I didn't, I never put my face on social media, but I just started sort of using it\n\n29:23.960 --> 29:28.840\nas an outlet for whatever desperate creative, you know, so I would do like Rorsch, I would,\n\n29:28.840 --> 29:33.060\nyou know, I had a little like barista and he would, I would do these Rorschach foam\n\n29:33.060 --> 29:39.480\nlatte interpretations or emoji book covers, and I would do like 12 likes.\n\n29:39.480 --> 29:41.840\nAnd you know, I was just kind of messing around and I was sitting at Erwan and these\n\n29:41.840 --> 29:46.240\ntwo women were talking, and they were talking about their friend Lisa, who was just obsessed\n\n29:46.240 --> 29:50.800\nwith Schwag, and she, like, her pipple was out of control, and so they had to freeze\n\n29:50.800 --> 29:51.800\ntheir eggs.\n\n29:51.800 --> 29:55.920\nAnd I was just like, I was just, you know, as we've all had that moment where you're\n\n29:55.920 --> 29:59.640\njust sitting in public and a conversation just sort of comes to you, and you just sort\n\n29:59.640 --> 30:01.560\nof, you know, just enjoy it.\n\n30:01.560 --> 30:04.680\nSo I just wrote it down and posted it on my account.\n\n30:04.680 --> 30:09.120\nYou talked backstage about, I think the interesting part of this story, because then it goes from\n\n30:09.120 --> 30:13.040\nthere, it's like, that's when you start to make people jealous and maybe draw some ire\n\n30:13.040 --> 30:17.800\nfrom the self-starters in the audience that haven't self-started yet, because like, from\n\n30:17.800 --> 30:22.400\nthere it just like, it gets popular, and then you franchise it and you like, you got like\n\n30:22.400 --> 30:26.280\nfive employees because you got, there's overheard London, there's overheard New York, and then\n\n30:26.280 --> 30:31.240\nyou also do like these branded things with like Uber and what have you, like where you're\n\n30:31.240 --> 30:35.960\nactually, I mean, I, what I like to hear is these stories that start and within two years\n\n30:35.960 --> 30:43.040\nyou've got a creative person or like, like that is paying their rent in a brand new fucking\n\n30:43.040 --> 30:52.240\nway that never existed and like without, it's like, we don't have to exploit labor or be\n\n30:52.240 --> 30:56.920\nbillion, it's just like, you just, you just created a job for yourself with this, with\n\n30:56.920 --> 31:03.240\nthis tool that is also often like the, the source of just dehumanization and misery,\n\n31:03.240 --> 31:07.200\nlike it's the, this larger function is like, yeah, but you know, people, you could just\n\n31:07.200 --> 31:12.920\nmake your own job, like Rob's selling t-shirts, he's making $2, ridiculing me, and\n\n31:12.920 --> 31:13.920\n$14.\n\n31:13.920 --> 31:15.920\nI make $2.\n\n31:15.920 --> 31:16.920\nOkay.\n\n31:16.920 --> 31:17.920\nYeah.\n\n31:17.920 --> 31:26.840\nBut anyways, but I, but I think the interesting thing is normal, regular friend dollars,\n\n31:26.840 --> 31:30.120\nso you're up, you're up 30 bones just from a couple of days ago.\n\n31:30.120 --> 31:31.120\nBones, dude, that's amazing.\n\n31:31.120 --> 31:32.120\nYes.\n\n31:32.120 --> 31:33.120\nI can use that word.\n\n31:33.120 --> 31:34.120\nWhat, bones?\n\n31:34.120 --> 31:35.120\nHe's.\n\n31:35.120 --> 31:36.280\nBut you make a great point.\n\n31:36.280 --> 31:43.760\nLike people love to hit it on Instagram and social media, but I mean, Instagram genuinely\n\n31:43.760 --> 31:44.760\nsaved my life.\n\n31:44.760 --> 31:45.760\nYeah.\n\n31:45.760 --> 31:47.440\nLike I was just a permanent fuck up the friend with potential.\n\n31:47.440 --> 31:48.440\nWhat is it interesting?\n\n31:48.440 --> 31:53.240\nThere's just random difference between these platforms that Instagram didn't have in mind\n\n31:53.240 --> 31:57.400\nat all, like it, because this is a thing that works on Instagram.\n\n31:57.400 --> 32:00.240\nAnd as you said backstage, it wouldn't work on Twitter.\n\n32:00.240 --> 32:01.240\nIt doesn't work.\n\n32:01.240 --> 32:02.240\nThere's much better shit on Twitter.\n\n32:02.240 --> 32:06.720\nTwitter, Twitter is like all text based and your thing is text based, but your thing works\n\n32:06.720 --> 32:11.120\non Instagram and where it is vastly monetizable.\n\n32:11.120 --> 32:14.200\nNothing's monetizable on Twitter except like the presidency.\n\n32:14.200 --> 32:15.200\nYou could, yeah.\n\n32:15.200 --> 32:18.880\nI mean, if you're playing for the big bucks, you can like make a lot of money on Twitter.\n\n32:18.880 --> 32:23.800\nBut it's just interesting to me that also tonally, and maybe this is part of it, is that\n\n32:23.800 --> 32:28.800\nif you tweet that you overheard something, you're kind of a, you're almost more of a\n\n32:28.800 --> 32:34.480\ndick than an Instagram that like curates it in a classy kind of like way that's sort\n\n32:34.480 --> 32:37.520\nof like, this is a celebration of the city.\n\n32:37.520 --> 32:41.240\nAnd it's like, what's fascinating to me is why that works, like what the psychological\n\n32:41.240 --> 32:42.240\nrouting is.\n\n32:42.240 --> 32:43.240\nYeah.\n\n32:43.240 --> 32:44.240\nI don't know.\n\n32:44.240 --> 32:45.840\nMy theory on, on Instagram, because I'm like, what if we don't overheard Ella?\n\n32:45.840 --> 32:47.240\nBecause it's certainly not a new idea.\n\n32:47.240 --> 32:51.840\nYou know, they're like the idea of anyone with a brain and, you know, a red Moleskine\n\n32:51.840 --> 32:55.720\njournal that they don't use has, you know, had that moment in public where someone said\n\n32:55.720 --> 32:58.080\nsomething weird and they've written it down.\n\n32:58.080 --> 32:59.080\nBy the way, do you want to drink?\n\n32:59.080 --> 33:00.320\nI sometimes people.\n\n33:00.320 --> 33:04.280\nI've had like, I have two drinks a year and it's usually with a better drinker.\n\n33:04.280 --> 33:05.280\nOkay.\n\n33:05.280 --> 33:06.280\nYeah.\n\n33:06.280 --> 33:08.520\nBut yeah, I would take like a tiny amount, like a thimble.\n\n33:08.520 --> 33:09.520\nLike a.\n\n33:09.520 --> 33:10.520\nCan we get this man a thimble?\n\n33:10.520 --> 33:11.520\nLike a d20.\n\n33:11.520 --> 33:12.520\nA d20.\n\n33:12.520 --> 33:13.520\nLike a d20.\n\n33:13.520 --> 33:16.240\nOh, nice to sneak in and try to play to the crowd.\n\n33:16.240 --> 33:17.240\nYeah, man.\n\n33:17.240 --> 33:18.840\nI grew up rolling dice.\n\n33:18.840 --> 33:19.840\nOkay.\n\n33:19.840 --> 33:20.840\nIt's true.\n\n33:20.840 --> 33:21.840\nWe talked about it backstage.\n\n33:21.840 --> 33:24.600\nBut we got deep.\n\n33:24.600 --> 33:29.440\nBut the truth is, is that like overheard on Twitter, on Facebook, it's just, it's part\n\n33:29.440 --> 33:35.360\nof the maelstrom of whatever it, for some reason, doing it on Instagram, having it text\n\n33:35.360 --> 33:37.960\nonly, having it sort of being, thank you.\n\n33:37.960 --> 33:39.840\nThat's like a d100.\n\n33:39.840 --> 33:41.560\nThank you.\n\n33:41.560 --> 33:47.360\nHaving it be kind of enshrined as an image where you can geotag it and you can have details\n\n33:47.360 --> 33:49.480\nin the caption.\n\n33:49.480 --> 33:52.640\nSo you have this sort of double experience where you're like, you read the thing and\n\n33:52.640 --> 33:54.880\nthen you sort of go down and you go like, oh, you know, where was it?\n\n33:54.880 --> 33:55.880\nDo I know that place?\n\n33:55.880 --> 33:56.880\nDo I know that person?\n\n33:56.880 --> 33:57.880\nDo you still put your own in?\n\n33:57.880 --> 34:01.240\nLike when you hear one, do you drop your own overheards in there?\n\n34:01.240 --> 34:05.840\nI reserve about 2% of the account for myself, but not, you know, I mean, certainly at the\n\n34:05.840 --> 34:11.480\nbeginning I was, you know, and I would imagine that some of it is genuinely overheard.\n\n34:11.480 --> 34:14.440\nSome of it is friends sitting around talking shit and sending it in.\n\n34:14.440 --> 34:18.480\nI sent you one that was two people that I was working with that were talking, but I\n\n34:18.480 --> 34:19.480\nstill overheard it.\n\n34:19.480 --> 34:20.480\nI thought it was fun.\n\n34:20.480 --> 34:25.320\nIt was like girls like talking to each other about setting each other up or whatever.\n\n34:25.320 --> 34:31.360\nAnd one of them, Nicole, was like, she's like so young that being set up is still fun.\n\n34:31.360 --> 34:36.720\nThe idea of like, she's just saying to our friend Leslie Arfin, like, she's like, you\n\n34:36.720 --> 34:42.280\nget it, I keep telling you, you know, set me up with some of these nerdy guys and Leslie\n\n34:42.280 --> 34:47.320\nhad some really, I don't know, in the room it was really funny, I was just listening\n\n34:47.320 --> 34:48.320\nto them.\n\n34:48.320 --> 34:54.280\nAnd she's like, yeah, but no, you don't understand, it's like they're actual nerds.\n\n34:54.280 --> 34:59.280\nIt's gross, it's not like Rushmore.\n\n34:59.280 --> 35:02.640\nReal nerds, it's not marketable.\n\n35:02.640 --> 35:06.040\nGav nerds, yeah.\n\n35:06.040 --> 35:07.040\nThat's when I sent you that.\n\n35:07.040 --> 35:11.920\nI was like, I've never submitted anything to Overheard LA, I'm gonna do this and then\n\n35:11.920 --> 35:16.880\nI got this response from, I assume you, that was like, what are you doing submitting to\n\n35:16.880 --> 35:17.880\nmy thing?\n\n35:17.880 --> 35:18.880\nI love your stuff.\n\n35:18.880 --> 35:22.800\nYeah, like Dungeons & Dragons episode, community, why are you talking to me, that kind of stuff.\n\n35:22.800 --> 35:26.480\nAnd then you didn't use my Overheard quote, but it's, I mean, it does, because I'm not\n\n35:26.480 --> 35:27.480\ngood at it.\n\n35:27.480 --> 35:31.680\nObviously, what are the odds that I'm gonna be good at overhearing and also a genius and\n\n35:31.680 --> 35:33.680\nall these other things.\n\n35:33.680 --> 35:37.920\nI think I said in the show before, by the way, they overheard the two guys at the bar\n\n35:37.920 --> 35:38.920\nabout vampires.\n\n35:38.920 --> 35:40.440\nDid I say that one?\n\n35:40.440 --> 35:41.440\nI can't remember.\n\n35:41.440 --> 35:42.440\nSay it.\n\n35:42.440 --> 35:45.040\nI walked into the burgundy room a long time ago and there was these two like kind of like\n\n35:45.040 --> 35:48.960\nrock and roll chicks at the bar and I walk up and this is all I heard.\n\n35:48.960 --> 35:51.040\nWhy are vampires so hot?\n\n35:51.040 --> 35:56.480\nAnd the other guy says, duh, because they're thin.\n\n35:56.480 --> 35:57.480\nThat's fucking good.\n\n35:57.480 --> 36:02.320\nYeah, I can certainly understand why people think the account is bullshit because everything\n\n36:02.320 --> 36:04.200\nkind of becomes bullshit at some point.\n\n36:04.200 --> 36:06.200\nWell, I don't think, I hope you didn't get that message.\n\n36:06.200 --> 36:09.760\nNo, no, no, no, no, but I mean, I'm just in terms of the comments and stuff like that.\n\n36:09.760 --> 36:12.160\nBut I mean, I was, I actually have been overheard.\n\n36:12.160 --> 36:17.640\nLike I have sat somewhere at a cafe, spoken in a way that I thought was authentic but\n\n36:17.640 --> 36:26.240\nwas actually incredibly embarrassing and douchey, and then have like some coy little cat person\n\n36:26.240 --> 36:27.240\nwrite my conversation down.\n\n36:27.240 --> 36:29.400\nObviously, I try to keep my face away from the account.\n\n36:29.400 --> 36:33.040\nI think it's a more interesting account if it's not about a person and have her submit\n\n36:33.040 --> 36:34.960\nme to me an hour later.\n\n36:34.960 --> 36:35.960\nRight.\n\n36:35.960 --> 36:36.960\nOh my God, that's insane.\n\n36:36.960 --> 36:37.960\nYeah.\n\n36:37.960 --> 36:41.800\nSo what, well, you've got to give us a specific, like what's the thing you said that you got?\n\n36:41.800 --> 36:43.800\nThat is, that is really interesting.\n\n36:43.800 --> 36:44.800\nYeah, yeah.\n\n36:44.800 --> 36:49.240\nI would vibrate something that's like, I just, you know, it's like asterisk, douchebag at\n\n36:49.240 --> 36:51.920\nWhole Foods or whatever, like, that's me.\n\n36:51.920 --> 36:55.200\nI'm looking for garlic stuffed olives.\n\n36:55.200 --> 36:57.080\nWell, there were two.\n\n36:57.080 --> 37:03.320\nThere was one, I was sitting, I was sitting at Verve, VRV, Verve, whatever, I was sitting\n\n37:03.320 --> 37:04.320\nat Verve.\n\n37:04.320 --> 37:05.320\nI work there.\n\n37:05.320 --> 37:09.840\nAnd this was early days, and these two girls, they were like musicians, they were cool,\n\n37:09.840 --> 37:10.840\nwhatever.\n\n37:10.840 --> 37:14.800\nAnd they sat down right next to me at Verve on Third Street, like right next to me, and\n\n37:14.800 --> 37:19.240\nthey start, they just sort of like brought themselves, you know, into my space in the\n\n37:19.240 --> 37:21.520\nway that some people in LA do.\n\n37:21.520 --> 37:24.520\nAnd I guess there were musicians, they were like, God, I miss, I miss Sweden.\n\n37:24.520 --> 37:27.400\nIt's just so much more authentic there.\n\n37:27.400 --> 37:30.960\nIt's just like people in Europe just understand music, they just get it.\n\n37:30.960 --> 37:34.160\nAnd then, and then the other girl just leans in really seriously, and she's like, so what's\n\n37:34.160 --> 37:36.680\nyour writing process?\n\n37:36.680 --> 37:40.040\nAnd I was just like, just fucking listening, I was like, whatever, you know, like, give\n\n37:40.040 --> 37:44.280\nme the fucking gold that's about to come from your deranged brain.\n\n37:44.280 --> 37:48.740\nAnd she's like, well, it sounds stupid, but like, have you heard of this Instagram account\n\n37:48.740 --> 37:49.740\nover her LA?\n\n37:49.740 --> 37:51.240\nAnd I was just like, huh?\n\n37:51.240 --> 37:55.840\nAnd I thought it was a sort of bit, and she starts saying that like, there was this post\n\n37:55.840 --> 37:58.280\nabout glitter, and it was really funny.\n\n37:58.280 --> 38:01.680\nSo she like went home and wrote a song about glitter, and I was just like sitting there\n\n38:01.680 --> 38:05.960\nand I was just like, okay, and then I posted that sort of like, you know, that's like a\n\n38:05.960 --> 38:11.400\nhall of mirrors, like you're like, you're like, you're seeing yourself in them bouncing back\n\n38:11.400 --> 38:12.400\nand forth.\n\n38:12.400 --> 38:13.920\nI remember something about that.\n\n38:13.920 --> 38:17.960\nI remember that being posted, I posted it and yeah, and then the other one I was like\n\n38:17.960 --> 38:24.000\nmaybe a year ago, I was sitting at La Colombe in Silver Lake, and I was whining to my female\n\n38:24.000 --> 38:28.880\nfriend about, you know, women in LA and how they date the same 12 celebrities and you\n\n38:28.880 --> 38:34.160\nknow, this, you know, naming names and like, you know, the whole thing.\n\n38:34.160 --> 38:35.960\nAnd then she just kind of submitted it to me.\n\n38:35.960 --> 38:41.320\nI was like, oh, I was like, wow, I'm like a middle-aged douche, like, what's wrong with\n\n38:41.320 --> 38:42.320\nme?\n\n38:42.320 --> 38:45.560\nI was on a plane, maybe it's taught me if I mentioned this before, I was sitting on a\n\n38:45.560 --> 38:50.760\nplane and we're getting ready to like, the passenger is still boarding and so they haven't\n\n38:50.760 --> 38:51.760\nlike closed the door yet.\n\n38:51.760 --> 38:59.120\nAnd there was an older gentleman behind me and he was on like, on his phone, like giving\n\n38:59.120 --> 39:00.120\nhis will.\n\n39:00.120 --> 39:05.560\nAnd he's like, hello, my name is James Harden, and I did today's date is blah, blah, blah,\n\n39:05.560 --> 39:06.560\nso am I in a body.\n\n39:06.560 --> 39:07.560\nI'd like to amend my will.\n\n39:07.560 --> 39:09.640\nI'm going to change a couple of things.\n\n39:09.640 --> 39:10.640\nHe started shaking it up.\n\n39:10.640 --> 39:14.120\nSo-and-so was going to get the thing, but now I'm going to give it to So-and-so.\n\n39:14.120 --> 39:18.120\nI was like, I think every time he gets on a plane, it's like, oh, you know what, fuck\n\n39:18.120 --> 39:19.120\nSusan.\n\n39:19.120 --> 39:25.060\nBut I wanna leave you back to me and go, hey man, is there something you know that I\n\n39:25.060 --> 39:26.060\ndon't know what

39:36.800\nDelta's a dangerous airline, it's-\n\n39:36.800 --> 39:37.800\nIt is?\n\n39:37.800 --> 39:39.720\nI don't even care.\n\n39:39.720 --> 39:41.520\nI don't care what airline I affect negatively.\n\n39:41.520 --> 39:48.520\nexcept JetBlue, New York to L.A. or vice versa.\n\n39:48.520 --> 39:51.520\nThat's a good one. That's the one I should take?\n\n39:51.520 --> 39:53.520\nI don't know. I think they're phased out.\n\n39:53.520 --> 39:54.520\nThey're phased out.\n\n39:54.520 --> 39:56.520\nThey've got caught being good or something.\n\n39:56.520 --> 40:00.520\nI've been taking Delta a lot lately. That's why I'm asking.\n\n40:00.520 --> 40:03.520\nDelta's the one that I really...\n\n40:03.520 --> 40:05.520\nWell, I mean, yeah.\n\n40:05.520 --> 40:07.520\nDelta's the one that sat me in coach.\n\n40:07.520 --> 40:09.520\nGive me a moment.\n\n40:09.520 --> 40:11.520\nOkay, okay.

like we kind of went biological\n\n01:28:08.520 --> 01:28:10.520\nwith it and that's where you got the trope\n\n01:28:10.520 --> 01:28:12.520\nof like oh you have to be naked\n\n01:28:12.520 --> 01:28:14.520\nlike take otherwise you're just going to be like\n\n01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:16.520\nbecause it was like we went it's funny\n\n01:28:16.520 --> 01:28:18.520\nhow like our consciousness of like sci-fi\n\n01:28:18.520 --> 01:28:20.520\nlike proceeds along certain lines like in the\n\n01:28:20.520 --> 01:28:22.520\n80s we were like an invisible\n\n01:28:22.520 --> 01:28:24.520\nperson would have to be would have to\n\n01:28:24.520 --> 01:28:26.520\nbe like oh your skin is invisible\n\n01:28:26.520 --> 01:28:28.520\nand then like so that means\n\n01:28:28.520 --> 01:28:30.520\nyou if you're wearing a sports bra it would\n\n01:28:30.520 --> 01:28:32.520\njust be a floating sports bra and then you take it off\n\n01:28:32.520 --> 01:28:34.520\nand then we would make these movies about\n\n01:28:34.520 --> 01:28:36.520\nlike oh no I'm naked and I'm\n\n01:28:36.520 --> 01:28:38.520\nbut we yeah it's now more like\n\n01:28:38.520 --> 01:28:40.520\nlike I think yeah like\n\n01:28:40.520 --> 01:28:42.520\nwe're talking today about like what okay\n\n01:28:42.520 --> 01:28:44.520\nwhat if Rick had an invisibility belt like\n\n01:28:44.520 --> 01:28:46.520\nwhat would it be a belt like he would\n\n01:28:46.520 --> 01:28:48.520\nhave designed it to be like easy to\n\n01:28:48.520 --> 01:28:50.520\njust so it's like I was\n\n01:28:50.520 --> 01:28:52.520\nI was like it'd probably be like a\n\n01:28:52.520 --> 01:28:54.520\nit's like a cloud of you know\n\n01:28:54.520 --> 01:28:56.520\nit like scans the contiguous surfaces\n\n01:28:56.520 --> 01:28:58.520\nyou know so\n\n01:28:58.520 --> 01:29:00.520\nif you're holding a coffee cup\n\n01:29:00.520 --> 01:29:02.520\nand you activate the bell\n\n01:29:02.520 --> 01:29:04.520\nlike the coffee couple disappear because\n\n01:29:04.520 --> 01:29:06.520\nfor the same reason your shirt does and your\n\n01:29:06.520 --> 01:29:08.520\nhair does and your fingernails and your\n\n01:29:08.520 --> 01:29:10.520\neverything because it's like\n\n01:29:10.520 --> 01:29:12.520\nit scans the\n\n01:29:12.520 --> 01:29:14.520\nsurfaces like stuff. So the cuff doesn't\n\n01:29:14.520 --> 01:29:16.520\nhave to wear a belt either? No\n\n01:29:16.520 --> 01:29:18.520\nthe cup doesn't have to wear a belt\n\n01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:20.520\nbut it could\n\n01:29:20.520 --> 01:29:22.520\nthe cup I'm sure could wear a little belt\n\n01:29:22.520 --> 01:29:24.520\nif the cup\n\n01:29:24.520 --> 01:29:26.520\nwears a little belt and then Rick\n\n01:29:26.520 --> 01:29:28.520\npicks it up would he not need\n\n01:29:28.520 --> 01:29:30.520\nthe belt anymore\n\n01:29:30.520 --> 01:29:32.520\nif it was the right\n\n01:29:32.520 --> 01:29:34.520\nalright well you actually I mean that's\n\n01:29:34.520 --> 01:29:36.520\ndid I break the story? Well you didn't break\n\n01:29:36.520 --> 01:29:38.520\n68 episodes\n\n01:29:38.520 --> 01:29:40.520\n68 episodes I mean that's actually\n\n01:29:40.520 --> 01:29:42.520\na pretty good point why not just put the belt around\n\n01:29:42.520 --> 01:29:44.520\na coffee cup and hold the coffee\n\n01:29:44.520 --> 01:29:46.520\nyou get a nice hot cup of coffee\n\n01:29:46.520 --> 01:29:48.520\nand you're invisible\n\n01:29:48.520 --> 01:29:50.520\nanytime you want to turn visible put the cup\n\n01:29:50.520 --> 01:29:52.520\ndown\n\n01:29:52.520 --> 01:29:54.520\nalright I'm telling you\n\n01:29:54.520 --> 01:29:56.520\nI'm using it. Tant stay up\n\n01:29:56.520 --> 01:29:58.520\nit makes more sense than having like\n\n01:29:58.520 --> 01:30:00.520\nworry about a belt around yourself\n\n01:30:00.520 --> 01:30:02.520\nI don't know what the fucking problem\n\n01:30:02.520 --> 01:30:04.520\nis over there\n\n01:30:06.520 --> 01:30:08.520\nbut it's kind of like you need like\n\n01:30:08.520 --> 01:30:10.520\na cloud of\n\n01:30:10.520 --> 01:30:12.520\nlike they kind of like\n\n01:30:12.520 --> 01:30:14.520\nmapped itself around your surfaces\n\n01:30:14.520 --> 01:30:16.520\nand like\n\n01:30:16.520 --> 01:30:18.520\nsubatomic cameras\n\n01:30:18.520 --> 01:30:20.520\nand like photo receptors\n\n01:30:20.520 --> 01:30:22.520\nand projectors that\n\n01:30:22.520 --> 01:30:24.520\nlike\n\n01:30:24.520 --> 01:30:26.520\nwe're taking in information from all\n\n01:30:26.520 --> 01:30:28.520\nthe light that hit it from every conceivable\n\n01:30:28.520 --> 01:30:30.520\nangle in real time and then simultaneously\n\n01:30:30.520 --> 01:30:32.520\nwhere it's like having a\n\n01:30:32.520 --> 01:30:34.520\nrelationship with anything\n\n01:30:34.520 --> 01:30:36.520\nin any variation of like behind it\n\n01:30:36.520 --> 01:30:38.520\nand then I asked the question like\n\n01:30:38.520 --> 01:30:40.520\nwell what if you back up against a wall\n\n01:30:40.520 --> 01:30:42.520\nwouldn't you then project a shadow\n\n01:30:42.520 --> 01:30:44.520\nunder your surface but then I was like\n\n01:30:44.520 --> 01:30:46.520\nno I'm thinking macroscopically\n\n01:30:46.520 --> 01:30:48.520\nlike if you if there's subatomic\n\n01:30:48.520 --> 01:30:50.520\nlike nano cameras\n\n01:30:50.520 --> 01:30:52.520\nI don't know if there's I don't know if you can go subatomic\n\n01:30:52.520 --> 01:30:54.520\nwith your nano but\n\n01:30:54.520 --> 01:30:56.520\nI mean hey what's nano\n\n01:30:56.520 --> 01:30:58.520\nif it's not subatomic\n\n01:30:58.520 --> 01:31:00.520\nbut if it's like then it's like you could like\n\n01:31:00.520 --> 01:31:02.520\npush up against a wall and still to like\n\n01:31:02.520 --> 01:31:04.520\nsomething that's like the size of an electron\n\n01:31:04.520 --> 01:31:06.520\nor like somewhat bigger\n\n01:31:06.520 --> 01:31:08.520\nthere'd still be a football field worth of distance\n\n01:31:08.520 --> 01:31:10.520\nbetween it and even a surface you're touching\n\n01:31:10.520 --> 01:31:12.520\nmaybe yeah and I also think that\n\n01:31:12.520 --> 01:31:14.520\nit would want to map like the surface\n\n01:31:14.520 --> 01:31:16.520\nand then the light level that it was\n\n01:31:16.520 --> 01:31:18.520\nyou know intercepting so\n\n01:31:18.520 --> 01:31:20.520\nbecause it's gonna like make these calculations\n\n01:31:20.520 --> 01:31:22.520\nlike well there's a spotlight on the front of me\n\n01:31:22.520 --> 01:31:24.520\nright then I'm gonna take information\n\n01:31:24.520 --> 01:31:26.520\nfrom between this camera on the back\n\n01:31:26.520 --> 01:31:28.520\nand then I'm gonna like it's basically like the whole\n\n01:31:28.520 --> 01:31:30.520\nthing's job obviously it sounds kind of dumb\n\n01:31:30.520 --> 01:31:32.520\nto say it out loud but it's like the whole thing's job\n\n01:31:32.520 --> 01:31:34.520\nis just to airbrush you out of\n\n01:31:34.520 --> 01:31:36.520\nof it exists it's to take\n\n01:31:36.520 --> 01:31:38.520\nin all available data which I do believe\n\n01:31:38.520 --> 01:31:40.520\nis possible it's just a matter of processing\n\n01:31:40.520 --> 01:31:42.520\nand AI and stuff that you would be able\n\n01:31:42.520 --> 01:31:44.520\nto have a cloud\n\n01:31:44.520 --> 01:31:46.520\nof technology around\n\n01:31:46.520 --> 01:31:48.520\nyou that was\n\n01:31:48.520 --> 01:31:50.520\nmaking calculations fast\n\n01:31:50.520 --> 01:31:52.520\nenough to simply adjust for what\n\n01:31:52.520 --> 01:31:54.520\nfor all light\n\n01:31:54.520 --> 01:31:56.520\ncoming at it and projecting\n\n01:31:56.520 --> 01:31:58.520\nlight outward you'd need like a tremendous amount\n\n01:31:58.520 --> 01:32:00.520\nof power probably too because it's not going to be powered\n\n01:32:00.520 --> 01:32:02.520\nby the light it would be like a battery\n\n01:32:02.520 --> 01:32:04.520\nthat would be running out because it would be like\n\n01:32:04.520 --> 01:32:06.520\nthe world's most fancy lamp\n\n01:32:06.520 --> 01:32:08.520\nwould be like sending out\n\n01:32:08.520 --> 01:32:10.520\nlike a bazillion light waves\n\n01:32:10.520 --> 01:32:12.520\nout that were like being compensated for\n\n01:32:12.520 --> 01:32:14.520\nthere's also like the version\n\n01:32:14.520 --> 01:32:16.520\nthat it just it doesn't actually do that\n\n01:32:16.520 --> 01:32:18.520\nit just it just moves the light that\n\n01:32:18.520 --> 01:32:20.520\nwould hit you to where it would\n\n01:32:20.520 --> 01:32:22.520\ngo past you so it just\n\n01:32:22.520 --> 01:32:24.520\nbends the light around you and then\n\n01:32:24.520 --> 01:32:26.520\nputs it back at the right exact angle\n\n01:32:26.520 --> 01:32:28.520\nright after it clears\n\n01:32:28.520 --> 01:32:30.520\nyour body so then it's the same beam\n\n01:32:30.520 --> 01:32:32.520\nof light that would go and hit you\n\n01:32:32.520 --> 01:32:34.520\nand reflect off showing a visual picture\n\n01:32:34.520 --> 01:32:36.520\nand that beam of light hits the\n\n01:32:36.520 --> 01:32:38.520\nhits the wall behind you and then vice-versa\n\n01:32:38.520 --> 01:32:40.520\nthe back way yeah I do believe that\n\n01:32:40.520 --> 01:32:42.520\nthere I'm certain that they got to be working\n\n01:32:42.520 --> 01:32:44.520\non that yeah in the military\n\n01:32:44.520 --> 01:32:46.520\nI know that like the\n\n01:32:46.520 --> 01:32:48.520\nthat that poor young lady that\n\n01:32:48.520 --> 01:32:50.520\nthat wound up in the water tank\n\n01:32:50.520 --> 01:32:52.520\nat the Cecil hotel like that\n\n01:32:52.520 --> 01:32:54.520\npart of that myth you know the\n\n01:32:54.520 --> 01:32:56.520\nconspiracy theories about that is that\n\n01:32:56.520 --> 01:32:58.520\nshe some there's some there's some like\n\n01:32:58.520 --> 01:33:00.520\nlike two degrees of separation\n\n01:33:00.520 --> 01:33:02.520\nbetween her and like\n\n01:33:02.520 --> 01:33:04.520\ninvisibility technology the\n\n01:33:04.520 --> 01:33:06.520\nred-handed podcast talk to the episode\n\n01:33:06.520 --> 01:33:08.520\nabout her after they hurt their\n\n01:33:08.520 --> 01:33:10.520\nappearance here while they were in LA\n\n01:33:10.520 --> 01:33:12.520\nthey and and it was\n\n01:33:12.520 --> 01:33:14.520\nit was like that the idea\n\n01:33:14.520 --> 01:33:16.520\nwas that that's what she's in the elevator\n\n01:33:16.520 --> 01:33:18.520\nand she's like interacting with things that\n\n01:33:18.520 --> 01:33:20.520\naren't there because she stumbled too close\n\n01:33:20.520 --> 01:33:22.520\nto cloaking tech\n\n01:33:22.520 --> 01:33:24.520\nI'm laughing because\n\n01:33:24.520 --> 01:33:26.520\nit's a terrible desecration\n\n01:33:26.520 --> 01:33:28.520\nof a human being's death to like have these\n\n01:33:28.520 --> 01:33:30.520\nweird Captain America theories about\n\n01:33:30.520 --> 01:33:32.520\nlike I just imagine her parents going\n\n01:33:32.520 --> 01:33:34.520\nlike I wonder what happened to her and\n\n01:33:34.520 --> 01:33:36.520\nwell I've got a theory I think that G.I.\n\n01:33:36.520 --> 01:33:38.520\nJoe did it and they're like\n\n01:33:38.520 --> 01:33:40.520\nthanks but\n\n01:33:40.520 --> 01:33:42.520\nstill kind of because there is\n\n01:33:42.520 --> 01:33:44.520\na scene in the elevator in Captain\n\n01:33:44.520 --> 01:33:46.520\nAmerica oh god right where\n\n01:33:46.520 --> 01:33:48.520\nhe's invisible I'm like\n\n01:33:48.520 --> 01:33:50.520\nwas he in visit yeah and that scene\n\n01:33:50.520 --> 01:33:52.520\nhave you seen the security camera\n\n01:33:52.520 --> 01:33:54.520\nfootage of the of the elite\n\n01:33:54.520 --> 01:33:56.520\nAliza lamb\n\n01:33:56.520 --> 01:33:58.520\nthat disappeared from the hotel\n\n01:33:58.520 --> 01:34:00.520\nand then ended up in the\n\n01:34:00.520 --> 01:34:02.520\nhave you seen that you're familiar with that\n\n01:34:02.520 --> 01:34:04.520\nI haven't watched it recently\n\n01:34:04.520 --> 01:34:06.520\nthat's fair\n\n01:34:06.520 --> 01:34:08.520\nhas cold case murder mysteries weighed in\n\n01:34:10.520 --> 01:34:12.520\nyes what did he say\n\n01:34:14.520 --> 01:34:16.520\nshe\n\n01:34:16.520 --> 01:34:18.520\nthat she\n\n01:34:18.520 --> 01:34:20.520\nwas off her meds and that\n\n01:34:20.520 --> 01:34:22.520\nshe may have even\n\n01:34:22.520 --> 01:34:24.520\nfound some stuff\n\n01:34:24.520 --> 01:34:26.520\nlike maybe took some e or something\n\n01:34:26.520 --> 01:34:28.520\nbut like in any case was off\n\n01:34:28.520 --> 01:34:30.520\nher meds and was experiencing\n\n01:34:30.520 --> 01:34:32.520\nand she that she was\n\n01:34:32.520 --> 01:34:34.520\nin a suicidal state and like\n\n01:34:34.520 --> 01:34:36.520\nkind of found her way\n\n01:34:36.520 --> 01:34:38.520\nup to the highest point\n\n01:34:38.520 --> 01:34:40.520\nand and just kind
