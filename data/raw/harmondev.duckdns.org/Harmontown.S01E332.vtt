00:00.000 --> 00:11.700
Hello again from downtown Los Angeles, next to MacArthur Park, which once again is melting

00:11.700 --> 00:12.700
in the dark.

00:12.700 --> 00:16.600
All that sweet green icing is blowing down, some of us might cake out in the rain.

00:16.600 --> 00:17.600
Let's welcome everybody.

00:17.600 --> 00:22.400
Thanks for coming down to Dynasty Typewriter, Harmontown is once again in session.

00:22.400 --> 00:28.400
Oh yeah, Spencer Crittenden to the stage, Spencer Crittenden.

00:28.400 --> 00:38.400
Hell yeah, let's bring out the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.

00:38.400 --> 00:57.400
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, okay, yo, yo, north, south, east and west, north, south,

00:57.400 --> 01:04.400
east and west, fuck your momma, came on her chest, okay, yeah, anyway, it went south

01:04.400 --> 01:05.400
immediately.

01:05.400 --> 01:10.000
As soon as you mentioned the directions, the whole thing goes south.

01:10.000 --> 01:22.520
I only wrote one thing down, I was at a party on Sunday and it was yesterday, and I know.

01:22.520 --> 01:27.960
One of mine is telling me, we were talking about a mutual friend of ours, and I was like,

01:27.960 --> 01:28.960
how's he doing?

01:28.960 --> 01:36.360
Oh, he's good, like, you know, we were talking about, we're all the same age, you know, mid-40s

01:36.360 --> 01:43.560
and this other person's a creative, and I was like, you know, is he self-sufficient?

01:43.560 --> 01:45.040
Can he afford to, what's he doing?

01:45.040 --> 01:49.200
Oh, he's on that one show, but he's also, you know, he's doing this and that, and I'm

01:49.200 --> 01:51.600
like, is it, well, yeah, where's he at?

01:51.600 --> 01:56.240
Like, is he scared of the future, or what is he, and I don't know why I'm teeing this

01:56.240 --> 02:00.240
up so much, we were just talking about our friend and his, like, situation or whatever

02:00.240 --> 02:04.440
that wasn't there, and my friend goes, he goes, you know, and he's got his daughter,

02:04.440 --> 02:12.440
his kid's all grown up, and she just got out of Yale, but I thought he said jail, but the

02:12.440 --> 02:20.920
crazy thing is how long the conversation continued, identically, because it was like, she's just

02:20.920 --> 02:24.360
got a, she's got a Yale, and you know, that's hundreds of thousands of dollars, I'm like,

02:24.360 --> 02:27.800
oh yeah, of course, like, how long was she in?

02:27.800 --> 02:34.880
Four years, Jesus, all right, well, I, like, so, I mean, is she, and is she even going

02:34.880 --> 02:44.360
to be able to get a job, like, you know, these days, it went on and on, and I was like, until

02:44.360 --> 02:53.680
I finally, like, was like, is she in jail or prison, and he's like, what, Yale, oh, okay,

02:53.680 --> 02:58.720
that's kind of funny, I just make no difference, no difference at all, just a fucked up situation

02:58.720 --> 02:59.720
to be in as a father.

02:59.720 --> 03:05.120
Yeah, she was hanging out with white supremacists, again, you can't tell, Yale or jail, you

03:05.120 --> 03:07.120
don't know what to do.

03:07.120 --> 03:13.400
Yeah, but he'll be fine, he's fine, yay, it sounds like, and I had some, I had some,

03:13.400 --> 03:17.760
some of that juicy, juicy rice, what was that, what's that stuff Dino makes, that garlicky

03:17.760 --> 03:18.760
rice?

03:18.760 --> 03:19.760
What?

03:19.760 --> 03:20.760
Yeah.

03:20.760 --> 03:21.760
What's that?

03:21.760 --> 03:25.240
It's like an orzo kind of pasta dish with the tomato kind of sauce, it's very good.

03:25.240 --> 03:26.240
That sounds pretty good.

03:26.240 --> 03:27.240
Yeah, I love it.

03:27.240 --> 03:28.240
You took food now.

03:28.240 --> 03:31.240
You threw a little Kefalotiri or some Azithra on that, you ready to go?

03:31.240 --> 03:32.240
Oh, of course.

03:32.240 --> 03:39.600
Have you guys seen the, the, the, the, the Holmes and Watson movie?

03:39.600 --> 03:47.120
Uh, you got, I mean, the first five minutes is like worth $30.

03:47.120 --> 03:54.720
I was, I was drunk granted, but like, I, I was like, like crying, not just from laughing,

03:54.720 --> 04:01.360
but also like emotion, like, like, like there's this like opening where the, where it's like

04:01.360 --> 04:06.360
the origin of Sherlock Holmes meeting Watson and like, it's, it's, I can't even remember

04:06.360 --> 04:08.480
the details, I just, I was like shrieking, laughing.

04:08.480 --> 04:10.080
Is this the Robert Downey Jr. kind of thing?

04:10.080 --> 04:15.680
No, no, this is the Will Ferrell, uh, uh, yeah, it, it, it then, it's just like after,

04:15.680 --> 04:21.360
it's like the first five minutes, like deserves an Academy Award for like a comedic opening

04:21.360 --> 04:23.640
about, about a Sherlock Holmes movie.

04:23.640 --> 04:27.800
It's just like, it's, it's, it's such a great, it promises so much.

04:27.800 --> 04:29.160
I don't know what happened.

04:29.160 --> 04:30.160
Who knows.

04:30.160 --> 04:31.160
I didn't even look at the credits.

04:31.160 --> 04:32.160
I don't, is that an Adam and Kay movie?

04:32.160 --> 04:33.160
I don't know.

04:33.160 --> 04:34.160
It probably is.

04:34.160 --> 04:35.160
Yeah.

04:35.160 --> 04:36.160
Cause it's the Gary Sanchez title card.

04:36.160 --> 04:38.160
Uh, but yeah, I don't know.

04:38.160 --> 04:39.160
I don't know.

04:39.160 --> 04:44.240
I'm such a fan of that, of that circle, I don't even, I just want to focus on what's

04:44.240 --> 04:45.240
good.

04:45.240 --> 04:46.240
I don't want to, I don't want to.

04:46.240 --> 04:47.240
Did you watch the whole thing?

04:47.240 --> 04:48.240
Yeah.

04:48.240 --> 04:49.240
Well, no, we actually stopped.

04:49.240 --> 04:55.560
I mean, that is really, I, I, I, I have enough respect for that camp that I'm, I, I assume

04:55.560 --> 04:59.440
they will not be offended, but they, they must know that that, that something happened

04:59.440 --> 05:04.160
there and the stinker got made, but, but I do, I, I just, I don't want to be a snoot

05:04.160 --> 05:05.160
about it.

05:05.160 --> 05:10.000
I just want to say, holy shit, best first five minutes of a fucking Sherlock Holmes story

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
ever.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
It's so, it's so cool.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
So if I'm on a plane, I'll just pop that in and watch the cold open.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
It's so worth it, man.

05:15.000 --> 05:20.560
I would almost, almost argue that it's worth like the whatever it costs on Apple TV, certainly

05:20.560 --> 05:24.000
the rental, rent it for the 3.99 or whatever it is.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
Maybe don't buy it.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
You're a millennial.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.600
You've, you've got enough problems.

05:28.600 --> 05:38.200
There Vice's article about how you ever see that porn genre, the, what's it called detective?

05:38.200 --> 05:39.200
The rent is due.

05:39.200 --> 05:40.200
What's it called?

05:40.200 --> 05:46.840
It's like a property, property bros or no, it's pro, it's like property, something,

05:46.840 --> 05:51.880
property sluts or property, sorry ladies.

05:51.880 --> 05:52.880
Property sex workers.

05:52.880 --> 05:58.040
No, it's, it's, it's, it's property, yeah, property, something, something like that.

05:58.040 --> 06:02.600
It's like the vice angle on it was millennials have a new genre of porn based on how broke

06:02.600 --> 06:08.640
they are because it's just people, it's like people either taking advantage of desperate

06:08.640 --> 06:09.640
realtors.

06:09.640 --> 06:13.520
It's all fictional, of course, but where it's like tenants that are getting evicted in it.

06:13.520 --> 06:18.360
It's just sort of like it's a genre of porn about encroaching poverty.

06:18.360 --> 06:23.080
Lay Ms. porn.

06:23.080 --> 06:25.480
I've, I've, I've, I've watched several.

06:25.480 --> 06:26.480
Sure.

06:26.480 --> 06:30.520
Did we ever talk about me getting into strap on porn?

06:30.520 --> 06:31.520
No.

06:31.520 --> 06:35.920
I feel like we, no, I, I, no, no, I think we've kind of breezed over that sometimes.

06:35.920 --> 06:36.920
Right.

06:36.920 --> 06:37.920
There was sort of a rush.

06:37.920 --> 06:43.120
There's like, it's, it's, it's really because of the high definition, like it's girl on

06:43.120 --> 06:49.760
girl and it's like, I think it's like Russian or something and like they, but they wear

06:49.760 --> 06:54.360
a lot of pantyhose and I'm like, I have a fetish in that, that area.

06:54.360 --> 07:00.200
But then it's like they use the pantyhose to like hold in a strap on.

07:00.200 --> 07:01.200
It's not a strap on.

07:01.200 --> 07:05.600
It's called, it's called strapless dildo action.

07:05.600 --> 07:06.600
How does it attach?

07:06.600 --> 07:07.600
Bros.

07:07.600 --> 07:09.600
How does it stay attached?

07:09.600 --> 07:12.680
What do they, they, they tie up, they tie some hose around the edge of the dildo.

07:12.680 --> 07:16.280
They kind of like, I think, I think there's a thing called field does.

07:16.280 --> 07:17.280
Sure.

07:17.280 --> 07:18.280
Ring a bell.

07:18.280 --> 07:19.280
Of course.

07:19.280 --> 07:20.920
Because there's, it's not strapped on.

07:20.920 --> 07:23.880
It's actually, there's, it's inserted on the other, on the host side.

07:23.880 --> 07:26.240
It's a double dildo.

07:26.240 --> 07:29.120
Such so that you're feeling it as you're using it.

07:29.120 --> 07:33.680
So it's not, you know, it's, I think it more passes the Beck Deltest as a strap, as a,

07:33.680 --> 07:38.640
as a, as a girl on girl, like a penetrative instrument.

07:38.640 --> 07:43.040
It's more like, hey, this is, this isn't just about pretending there's a dick here.

07:43.040 --> 07:45.240
This is like, this is about feeling good.

07:45.240 --> 07:46.240
Oh man.

07:46.240 --> 07:47.240
Rob Schrab everybody.

07:47.240 --> 07:54.240
Oh yeah.

07:54.240 --> 07:57.240
Hey Rob.

07:57.240 --> 07:58.240
Hello Jeff.

07:58.240 --> 08:01.520
Rob, you've got a mysterious package in your lap there.

08:01.520 --> 08:03.520
It's a field dough.

08:03.520 --> 08:04.520
Yes.

08:04.520 --> 08:05.520
No.

08:05.520 --> 08:11.560
It is, it is, that, that could be the exact size of a box for, for a large, a large sex

08:11.560 --> 08:12.560
toy.

08:12.560 --> 08:17.840
It's like, hey, stuff of what Dan was saying, I thought, there's an opening, man.

08:17.840 --> 08:18.840
I'm going to go for it.

08:18.840 --> 08:19.840
An opening.

08:19.840 --> 08:20.840
Get it?

08:20.840 --> 08:21.840
All right.

08:21.840 --> 08:22.840
Yeah.

08:22.840 --> 08:23.840
Well, we got a guest tonight.

08:23.840 --> 08:24.840
So, okay.

08:24.840 --> 08:25.840
If you're going to do this.

08:25.840 --> 08:26.840
Do you want to explain what this is?

08:26.840 --> 08:34.120
Is it a box that you showed me in the, I guess we should start with our text conversation.

08:34.120 --> 08:41.680
Because you're, it's important for me to let people know what an asshole you are.

08:41.680 --> 08:50.120
You know, some of you may know that Rob, I coat, my, my fiance took a pretty nice photo

08:50.120 --> 08:54.600
of me at a hotel in Pasadena, looking handsome and happy.

08:54.600 --> 08:58.800
Is there any way we could put it up on, on the screen?

08:58.800 --> 08:59.800
It doesn't matter.

08:59.800 --> 09:00.800
It doesn't matter.

09:00.800 --> 09:01.800
No.

09:01.800 --> 09:04.360
I think the audience would like to know what you're talking about.

09:04.360 --> 09:05.360
Woo.

09:05.360 --> 09:06.860
Is there any way?

09:06.860 --> 09:10.680
Chris is our way to put that image up on the, if we thought of that before, there definitely

09:10.680 --> 09:11.680
would have been a way.

09:11.680 --> 09:12.680
Jumbotron?

09:12.680 --> 09:13.680
It doesn't matter.

09:13.680 --> 09:14.680
It doesn't matter.

09:14.680 --> 09:15.680
It's a podcast.

09:15.680 --> 09:18.440
I've given up on the visuals.

09:18.440 --> 09:22.600
I've given up on a lot of things and I had a rare moment of happiness at a hotel in Pasadena.

09:22.600 --> 09:27.280
Cody captured it and I was looking very handsome and she called me a snack.

09:27.280 --> 09:28.280
Right.

09:28.280 --> 09:32.800
Which is a, which is a reference used by the, the boys from Hollywood Handbook, who I believe

09:32.800 --> 09:35.360
are going to be guesting on the show next week.

09:35.360 --> 09:36.360
Oh.

09:36.360 --> 09:37.360
Excited.

09:37.360 --> 09:38.360
Wow.

09:38.360 --> 09:39.560
I think so.

09:39.560 --> 09:43.280
And so Cody, yeah, it was nice.

09:43.280 --> 09:51.640
And then Rob took the photo and he used, like in his very juvenile, you know, color marker

09:51.640 --> 09:52.640
way.

09:52.640 --> 09:59.760
He put lipstick and eye makeup and a ponytail and a purse on me and, and breasts.

09:59.760 --> 10:04.040
But the purse was so crudely drawn that he had to write the word purse on an arrow pointing

10:04.040 --> 10:05.040
to the purse.

10:05.040 --> 10:06.040
Yeah.

10:06.040 --> 10:07.040
I was using my finger.

10:07.040 --> 10:08.040
Yeah.

10:08.040 --> 10:10.880
I couldn't tell from the lettering.

10:10.880 --> 10:12.400
I thought you had a special stylus.

10:12.400 --> 10:16.560
I was sure you were using a Cintiq tablet.

10:16.560 --> 10:17.560
No.

10:17.560 --> 10:26.120
He used his fucking ape finger and his dumb old man phone probably has the, the disability

10:26.120 --> 10:33.320
settings on Zoom so he can read text from his long suffering life.

10:33.320 --> 10:40.040
Can't please continue then what happened?

10:40.040 --> 10:43.520
So he made this photo and then he put it and then he, and then he immediately started selling

10:43.520 --> 10:49.600
it on a t-shirt called Dan Harmon and his purse t-shirt.

10:49.600 --> 10:56.480
If you, if you have a phone, if you have a phone, maybe take a second to go to my Instagram

10:56.480 --> 11:00.840
Rob Schrab and just see what we're talking about since we can't have, have this.

11:00.840 --> 11:07.400
And if you want to buy a t-shirt, go ahead because it's, it's, it's going down.

11:07.400 --> 11:09.440
It's only up for another 24 hours.

11:09.440 --> 11:10.440
Oh wow.

11:10.440 --> 11:13.400
You only have another 24 hours to own this piece of history.

11:13.400 --> 11:14.880
You could actually, you could actually sue him, Dan.

11:14.880 --> 11:18.760
You know, people aren't allowed to profit off of your image without your consent.

11:18.760 --> 11:20.000
He won't do it.

11:20.000 --> 11:29.280
So today at 6.44 p.m. he texted me, I deserve a ride to the show tonight.

11:29.280 --> 11:33.840
And I said, you mocked me online in front of the dozens to three dozen people that follow

11:33.840 --> 11:36.280
you.

11:36.280 --> 11:40.320
And he said, sold 25 shirts.

11:40.320 --> 11:44.480
And I said, undercut a decade of work toward gender equality.

11:44.480 --> 11:46.760
And he said, you're welcome.

11:46.760 --> 11:49.640
And he said, Cody and Kate, he did it.

11:49.640 --> 11:52.120
I'll be out front at 7.30.

11:52.120 --> 11:57.640
And I said, parentheses, hearted.

11:57.640 --> 11:59.360
He meant to say hearted.

11:59.360 --> 12:00.840
They heated it.

12:00.840 --> 12:02.560
No, I didn't.

12:02.560 --> 12:08.600
What did they heat it with, fucking, shut up, stupid.

12:08.600 --> 12:15.960
So, and then he got in the car at 7.30 and with this box and it says, it's from Mike

12:15.960 --> 12:17.400
Cravello's world.

12:17.400 --> 12:18.400
Yes.

12:18.400 --> 12:24.400
Which is a camera shop in Milwaukee celebrating their 50th anniversary this year.

12:24.400 --> 12:27.800
And if you know us, you know that we love the song, that there's a great local ad that

12:27.800 --> 12:31.000
have a wonderful jingle that we adore.

12:31.000 --> 12:36.600
When you're thinking cameras, there's a world of things to see.

12:36.600 --> 12:44.200
We've got a choice from a wide selection of the highest quality and the staff of professional

12:44.200 --> 12:48.360
people dedicated to serving you.

12:48.360 --> 12:54.680
So when you're thinking cameras, one place stands alone.

12:54.680 --> 13:00.760
Mike Cravello's world has got that extra something, a service and quality.

13:00.760 --> 13:10.960
A warm and friendly world, reflecting our lives through photography.

13:10.960 --> 13:17.520
Mike Cravello's world is a wonderful world of cameras.

13:17.520 --> 13:22.680
Mike Cravello's world is a wonderful world of cameras.

13:22.680 --> 13:25.600
Happy 50th anniversary.

13:25.600 --> 13:30.600
My parents worked in the film industry in Milwaukee.

13:30.600 --> 13:38.400
And by that, I mean, my dad kind of mopped floors at this place where they had chemical

13:38.400 --> 13:43.200
vats and they would process film and my mom spliced stuff.

13:43.200 --> 13:48.640
My dad kind of worked his way up to sales and things.

13:48.640 --> 13:55.480
But a place called Kluge Communications, I think it was called.

13:55.480 --> 13:58.600
And that's where my parents worked.

13:58.600 --> 14:01.720
And so they would go to Mike Cravello's Christmas party.

14:01.720 --> 14:09.560
It was kind of like a who's who of Milwaukee's film community kind of thing.

14:09.560 --> 14:11.280
Oh, the fucking happened there.

14:11.280 --> 14:16.000
I just really does seem, I remember my parents coming home and going, whoa, that Mike Cravello's

14:16.000 --> 14:17.960
world is fucking crazy.

14:17.960 --> 14:19.360
I was like, what do you mean?

14:19.360 --> 14:22.720
They're like ice sculptures and there was a live python.

14:22.720 --> 14:25.840
It just sounded very fondue orgy.

14:25.840 --> 14:30.080
I always pictured Mike Cravello as like this Robert Evans.

14:30.080 --> 14:33.960
Anyways, his world is a wonderful world of cameras.

14:33.960 --> 14:34.960
Wonderful world of cameras.

14:34.960 --> 14:39.200
Anyway, on my way back from Atlanta, where I was shooting Creepshow, which is coming

14:39.200 --> 14:49.280
to Shutter this fall, I stopped home in Milwaukee and went to dinner with my family.

14:49.280 --> 14:54.600
And on the way, Mike Cravello's was there and I said, I got fucking good at Mike Cravello's.

14:54.600 --> 14:59.520
I walked in, talked it, chatted up with the with the team.

14:59.520 --> 15:02.680
They showed me around, showed me behind the scenes.

15:02.680 --> 15:05.880
They seem like they're dedicated to serving you.

15:05.880 --> 15:08.960
Yeah, they were dedicated.

15:08.960 --> 15:18.120
And this afternoon when I came home, this box was waiting for me from Mike Cravello's.

15:18.120 --> 15:20.880
And I haven't opened it up yet.

15:20.880 --> 15:31.840
And to bring some showmanship to this show, this dead elephant, this snog, to bring it

15:31.840 --> 15:36.080
back to entertain some of these people for once.

15:36.080 --> 15:50.720
I'm going to open what slog snog snog like the British slang for kissing.

15:50.720 --> 16:02.880
I'm going to open this box on live podcast, okay, well, you know, so fucking mics are

16:02.880 --> 16:13.960
expensive, man.

16:13.960 --> 16:17.520
So Robert's having a little difficulty with the tape.

16:17.520 --> 16:18.520
I don't think he's trying.

16:18.520 --> 16:19.520
You know, you're building a suspense.

16:19.520 --> 16:23.880
Yeah, you're like, you're like, like Johnny Carson, like Karnak, opening the envelope,

16:23.880 --> 16:32.800
you know, we got a, we lost a, you're not even trying.

16:32.800 --> 16:34.920
You want me to procure you like a blade or something like that?

16:34.920 --> 16:36.560
It sounds like he doesn't want that.

16:36.560 --> 16:37.560
Okay.

16:37.560 --> 16:38.560
You got enough to pull now.

16:38.560 --> 16:39.560
You got enough to pull.

16:39.560 --> 16:40.560
All right.

16:40.560 --> 16:45.560
That's piece of tape never won.

16:45.560 --> 16:50.160
When you're sinking cameras, there's a world of things to see.

16:50.160 --> 16:53.680
I told her, I guess, you know, we usually talk for 10 minutes and then I'll bring you

16:53.680 --> 16:54.680
out.

16:54.680 --> 16:57.280
Oh, there's no, there's no clock.

16:57.280 --> 17:00.920
Did you ever fight with somebody?

17:00.920 --> 17:05.360
My dad sued my mom for twenty thousand dollars.

17:05.360 --> 17:07.120
Are you sure you're allowed to talk about this in front of people?

17:07.120 --> 17:08.120
I don't care.

17:08.120 --> 17:11.120
I hope they both die.

17:11.120 --> 17:17.360
Oh, no, but when my parents split up, my dad, like, I don't think this is going to follow

17:17.360 --> 17:18.360
that.

17:18.360 --> 17:23.120
So yeah, I'm going to open this a little quicker and we can get back to save that story.

17:23.120 --> 17:27.720
Let's put a bit in that because you're going to go and I hate each other and I've never

17:27.720 --> 17:33.560
done it and they used to beat me on Christmas, I'm going to go, it's a napkin.

17:33.560 --> 17:37.240
That sounds like the best possible way things could go.

17:37.240 --> 17:44.880
Well, I could eulogize John Singleton, Generation X legend, who's taken from us way too early

17:44.880 --> 17:47.080
today at the age of 51.

17:47.080 --> 17:53.120
I guess he had a stroke in April and his family had to make a terrible decision today to take

17:53.120 --> 17:55.200
him off life support.

17:55.200 --> 18:00.800
He was the youngest director ever in the history of the Academy Awards to be nominated.

18:00.800 --> 18:04.720
I thought it was 24 with boys in the hood, but maybe he was 24 when he got nominated.

18:04.720 --> 18:06.200
I don't know, maybe he was 23 when he made it.

18:06.200 --> 18:08.400
But at least you've stopped to correct me.

18:08.400 --> 18:09.400
Keep going.

18:09.400 --> 18:12.400
Well, it's probably important to people who keep track of these fucking records.

18:12.400 --> 18:16.000
Which I read online, 23.

18:16.000 --> 18:20.600
Also the first African-American to be nominated in that category, but we don't see race at

18:20.600 --> 18:22.040
Harmontown.

18:22.040 --> 18:23.400
We only see youth.

18:23.400 --> 18:26.200
Which is the only thing that matters to us.

18:26.200 --> 18:46.080
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, it's a sign.

18:46.080 --> 18:48.080
Wrapped in plastic.

18:48.080 --> 18:51.560
Are you fucking kidding me?

18:51.560 --> 18:53.600
Get out of plastic.

18:53.600 --> 18:57.720
They couldn't find a smaller box for that?

18:57.720 --> 19:00.680
It's two signs.

19:00.680 --> 19:01.680
What a day.

19:01.680 --> 19:05.680
One for me and one for Spencer.

19:05.680 --> 19:06.680
Oh.

19:06.680 --> 19:07.680
Yes.

19:07.680 --> 19:08.680
Can we come over here?

19:08.680 --> 19:09.680
Can we come in here?

19:09.680 --> 19:14.680
Can we take all three ads and fill in the NASCAR, would you put, like, one?

19:14.680 --> 19:15.680
Yeah, that's good.

19:15.680 --> 19:20.880
Just hold it like that for however long he talks.

19:20.880 --> 19:23.400
There's nothing else in that box like maybe a camera.

19:23.400 --> 19:24.400
Is there a letter?

19:24.400 --> 19:26.720
Look, yeah, look, keep looking at the car.

19:26.720 --> 19:27.720
I'm looking.

19:27.720 --> 19:28.720
It looks empty.

19:28.720 --> 19:29.720
That's empty.

19:29.720 --> 19:31.920
It's pretty empty.

19:31.920 --> 19:35.320
So he just gave you advertising.

19:35.320 --> 19:39.680
That's great as a forest of trees died for that box.

19:39.680 --> 19:42.280
You could definitely have put these in an envelope.

19:42.280 --> 19:46.520
These are a forest.

19:46.520 --> 19:47.520
There you go.

19:47.520 --> 19:48.520
There we go.

19:48.520 --> 19:51.120
Big logo.

19:51.120 --> 19:56.520
I think John Singleton was 23.

19:56.520 --> 19:59.120
Yeah, that's what I read, too.

19:59.120 --> 20:04.920
I don't know why he's got his head up his ass all the time.

20:04.920 --> 20:09.520
You got a couple of years, I'll explain it to you.

20:09.520 --> 20:10.520
Okay.

20:10.520 --> 20:15.240
Well, our first guest.

20:15.240 --> 20:30.640
Our next guest is a self-made internet curator of mirth and frivolity.

20:30.640 --> 20:37.400
He's the founder of Overheard in LA, which is an Instagram that's majorly followed.

20:37.400 --> 20:43.200
He went on to become the founder of many franchises to Thingamabobs that sprung out from that,

20:43.200 --> 20:47.880
but made himself out of dirt without permission, just like somebody I know named Dan Harmon.

20:47.880 --> 20:56.560
Please welcome the Dan Harmon of Instagram, Jesse Margolis.

20:56.560 --> 20:57.960
I'm not that good at introductions.

20:57.960 --> 20:59.960
I'm sorry, Jesse.

20:59.960 --> 21:03.400
Come on, move down, Mike.

21:03.400 --> 21:05.680
What's up, Jesse?

21:05.680 --> 21:07.880
Hello.

21:07.880 --> 21:11.360
Thanks for creating Overheard LA.

21:11.360 --> 21:13.560
What's the username if you want to follow it on Instagram?

21:13.560 --> 21:15.160
It's Overheard LA.

21:15.160 --> 21:17.360
It is Overheard LA.

21:17.360 --> 21:20.720
We've got a bunch now, but yeah, that was the first child.

21:20.720 --> 21:26.120
I commented today, and in the past, I got to retract this now, as I said in my comment

21:26.120 --> 21:29.920
today, because I was like, in the past, I have seen one.

21:29.920 --> 21:33.880
I guess people have a visceral reaction when they think one is fake.

21:33.880 --> 21:38.000
First of all, let's give a classic example, whether it's your favorite or you just think

21:38.000 --> 21:41.840
it's like a classic Overheard LA quote.

21:41.840 --> 21:49.720
I think my all-time favorite is, you can't be vegan in jail.

21:49.720 --> 21:58.760
I don't know if that's true, but in Yale, I don't know if you can be vegan in Yale.

21:58.760 --> 22:01.720
There was one yesterday, but in the past, I remember seeing one, and I can't remember

22:01.720 --> 22:04.760
which one I saw, where I was like, I hate it when they're fake.

22:04.760 --> 22:11.320
I had this visceral reaction, I feel like my job is to police, like, that one's fake.

22:11.320 --> 22:17.960
It comes out of a place of love, because the joy isn't like, oh, this is a hilariously

22:17.960 --> 22:19.760
written thing.

22:19.760 --> 22:25.120
The joy isn't really believing that this was genuinely, this was Overheard, and then I

22:25.120 --> 22:31.400
guess it trips a kind of anger in people that I can attest to when it meets our definition

22:31.400 --> 22:35.200
of phony or something, or like, this one's fake.

22:35.200 --> 22:41.880
But the weird thing is, I'm never doing it again, because I saw one the other day, yesterday,

22:41.880 --> 22:48.000
it was like a kid on a plane, like a four-year-old on a plane or something, and the kid says,

22:48.000 --> 22:53.480
Alexa, fly me up into the sky now, is the kid saying that, and everyone's like, this

22:53.480 --> 22:57.360
is fucking real thing.

22:57.360 --> 23:01.080
People don't, I mean, it was 10 years ago, Jeff said he saw some kid at the airport pinching

23:01.080 --> 23:08.560
and zooming a magazine cover, like, of course these larvae think that, I think I wrote,

23:08.560 --> 23:11.800
I'm just surprised the plane didn't shoot up in the air and land like a fucking lawn

23:11.800 --> 23:12.800
dart.

23:12.800 --> 23:15.000
Jesse, how are they, how is that curated?

23:15.000 --> 23:18.960
People submit them, and then there's a team of people that select the ones that go up

23:18.960 --> 23:20.960
on the grains?

23:20.960 --> 23:27.080
Yes, there's a bipedal Jewish Instagram account sitting right here that goes through it, no,

23:27.080 --> 23:30.800
we have a team of people, but in terms of the LA account, I go through it.

23:30.800 --> 23:37.320
So we get submissions, you know, we aren't journalists, you know, I don't, and I don't

23:37.320 --> 23:41.240
know what that means that's, yeah, I mean, well you can't, because sometimes there was

23:41.240 --> 23:45.520
another recent one, for instance, where it was a, no, you have, like, I'm like obsessed

23:45.520 --> 23:50.480
with your show, and you have like the canon of a fucking meme account.

23:50.480 --> 23:55.000
There was one where there was like a guest talking to a host at a restaurant, and then

23:55.000 --> 23:58.320
people were like, that was a really mean thing to say or something like that, and then this

23:58.320 --> 24:03.440
will happen a lot, like in the comments, a person who was involved with the quote, which

24:03.440 --> 24:06.880
doesn't surprise me, because that's probably a person that submitted or whatever, and they

24:06.880 --> 24:11.680
go like, oh, that was me, actually, and the host was my friend, and they were kind of

24:11.680 --> 24:15.680
razzing me, but it was like, oh, and then someone overheard it, and it's like, so it's

24:15.680 --> 24:20.960
both true, but at the same time, it wasn't like a stranger, like taking the shit out

24:20.960 --> 24:26.000
of a stranger, as maybe the overheard person thought, but...

24:26.000 --> 24:31.360
Yeah, I think that it kills me, because obviously, when you create something, whether it's a

24:31.360 --> 24:38.520
giant television show, or a podcast on stage, or whatever it is, you care about it.

24:38.520 --> 24:42.760
We like to call it a snog.

24:42.760 --> 24:51.520
You care about it, so I see those comments, and it's a little frustrating, because that's

24:51.520 --> 24:55.980
a sort of white box, and people look at that white box for the last couple of years, those

24:55.980 --> 25:01.080
who care enough to follow it, or whatever, and hopefully, they have their own moment

25:01.080 --> 25:02.080
of imagination.

25:02.080 --> 25:06.000
They know the location, they've met some douchebag like that, they've been that douchebag, whatever

25:06.000 --> 25:12.080
it is, and yeah, the internet is a place for people to get angry, and you know.

25:12.080 --> 25:17.920
Do you have a filter that you go through, like that you apply, do you see things, that's

25:17.920 --> 25:21.720
probably somebody wrote that, that that seems too good to be true, or something like that?

25:21.720 --> 25:27.880
I do the, I don't know what the word is, where you Google on Twitter, like Google, no you

25:27.880 --> 25:33.240
like search on, you search on, yeah, like so basically if anything is too good, or it's

25:33.240 --> 25:37.960
just too on point, we'll do a Google search, and I'll search on Twitter, which usually

25:37.960 --> 25:44.640
where a lot of great comedians and smart people have been slamming away for the last 10 years,

25:44.640 --> 25:48.280
and then we'll sort of post something, and I'll do a little browse of the comments.

25:48.280 --> 25:52.040
I know sometimes we've posted stuff, and 20 minutes in, someone will be like, that's

25:52.040 --> 25:56.800
from the Mindy shelf, and I'm like, okay, you know, obviously someone's had a similar

25:56.800 --> 26:01.160
experience, or someone's tried to get on the account, so then we just delete it.

26:01.160 --> 26:08.800
Is there a kind of, on the other end of that spectrum, is there, are there qualities criteria

26:08.800 --> 26:14.520
that make for a particularly LA-ish quote, or you know, like someone's like, oh, now

26:14.520 --> 26:16.920
that's an overheard LA gem.

26:16.920 --> 26:21.160
Yeah, I mean, the problem with LA is it can be so magical, like I don't know if you're

26:21.160 --> 26:27.080
familiar with Cafe Gratitude, I'm sure you're there daily, but it's a restaurant you go

26:27.080 --> 26:30.640
to, and you sort of, you know, have to like, you know, say this mantra while you order

26:30.640 --> 26:32.840
your like vegan slop.

26:32.840 --> 26:37.800
And they write stuff, it's a very Pete Holmes, the restaurant, I think Pete Holmes loves

26:37.800 --> 26:38.800
it.

26:38.800 --> 26:42.320
And the names of the foods are all kind of like, I am Pete Murphy or something.

26:42.320 --> 26:47.280
And, you know, Sparkle Joy, but like, it's very similar to Kendrick Lamar's, you know,

26:47.280 --> 26:51.440
Album Damn, you know, like Humble and Love and stuff like that.

26:51.440 --> 26:57.480
So, you know, I mean, there's specific things where, you know, it's the cocaine and the

26:57.480 --> 26:59.920
vegans and the absurd.

26:59.920 --> 27:05.160
It's that blend of self-care, it's self-loathing, self-obsession, like all the selfs, that's

27:05.160 --> 27:06.160
the LA thing.

27:06.160 --> 27:09.800
It's like, it's like, it's like people, people believing that, I mean, it's like the same

27:09.800 --> 27:14.240
people talking about yoga, you know, who did ketamine last night kind of thing.

27:14.240 --> 27:15.240
Yeah.

27:15.240 --> 27:16.240
Yeah, or Yoda.

27:16.240 --> 27:17.240
Yeah.

27:17.240 --> 27:21.520
So, hopefully it's something that, you know, is relatable in the worst or the best way,

27:21.520 --> 27:22.920
but isn't so tropey.

27:22.920 --> 27:27.160
I think the LA account, like the New York account is sometimes, you know, more interesting

27:27.160 --> 27:29.240
because New York's just a more forgiving place.

27:29.240 --> 27:31.800
It's like, you can imagine anything happening in New York.

27:31.800 --> 27:35.840
You can imagine someone on the street, you know, trying to give away an espresso machine.

27:35.840 --> 27:36.840
Right.

27:36.840 --> 27:37.840
Right.

27:37.840 --> 27:38.840
Whereas in LA, you're like, no one talks to each other.

27:38.840 --> 27:40.320
You know, you're not on the street.

27:40.320 --> 27:41.320
Yeah.

27:41.320 --> 27:46.880
New York's got the built-in, there's the blue collar guys that you wouldn't even believe

27:46.880 --> 27:47.880
existed in LA.

27:47.880 --> 27:54.040
Like, you could make one up in New York because it would be like, oh, excuse me, sir, where

27:54.040 --> 27:56.280
can I feed my chihuahua?

27:56.280 --> 28:03.600
And then some guy going, lady, I'm gonna eat that fucking thing, I'm lifting a stained

28:03.600 --> 28:04.600
glass.

28:04.600 --> 28:05.600
I don't know.

28:05.600 --> 28:07.120
I've never been to New York.

28:07.120 --> 28:12.840
Yeah, I mean, I worked at the Humane Society of New York and it was very similar to that.

28:12.840 --> 28:18.560
But yeah, so in some ways, LA's, you know, it's a harder account to do because, you know,

28:18.560 --> 28:22.280
you really want it to be special and there are these tropes because they're true.

28:22.280 --> 28:23.280
Yeah.

28:23.280 --> 28:26.040
We should tell the story about the creation of this just for a second.

28:26.040 --> 28:31.840
It was like, 2016, you, I mean, is that the right year maybe?

28:31.840 --> 28:34.040
Yeah, it was like late 2015.

28:34.040 --> 28:36.000
You really just, as anyone might expect.

28:36.000 --> 28:40.760
I mean, you just, you're just doing it, doing the thing.

28:40.760 --> 28:42.960
I mean, it's some shit you overheard yourself personally.

28:42.960 --> 28:45.600
Yeah, well, it started out, it started out, I mean, I don't know if it's interesting or

28:45.600 --> 28:50.760
not, but it started off with me being pretty broke and spending a lot of time at Erwan,

28:50.760 --> 28:55.320
which is, you know, the sort of elevated Whole Foods, you know, sort of like Daytime

28:55.320 --> 29:02.240
Night Club where they sell like $24, you know, sprouted, you know, and it's nowhere backwards,

29:02.240 --> 29:03.240
man.

29:03.240 --> 29:04.240
It's not technically nowhere.

29:04.240 --> 29:05.240
Yeah, it's good that it is.

29:05.240 --> 29:06.240
I hate to see L.A. more.

29:06.240 --> 29:10.760
Yeah, I gotta take it Erwan, it's really fucking terrible.

29:10.760 --> 29:15.360
But I had sort of, someone had made me an Instagram account called ThinJewish, and this

29:15.360 --> 29:19.280
was like when Instagram was first starting, and I didn't really know, you know, what Instagram

29:19.280 --> 29:23.960
was, I didn't, I never put my face on social media, but I just started sort of using it

29:23.960 --> 29:28.840
as an outlet for whatever desperate creative, you know, so I would do like Rorsch, I would,

29:28.840 --> 29:33.060
you know, I had a little like barista and he would, I would do these Rorschach foam

29:33.060 --> 29:39.480
latte interpretations or emoji book covers, and I would do like 12 likes.

29:39.480 --> 29:41.840
And you know, I was just kind of messing around and I was sitting at Erwan and these

29:41.840 --> 29:46.240
two women were talking, and they were talking about their friend Lisa, who was just obsessed

29:46.240 --> 29:50.800
with Schwag, and she, like, her pipple was out of control, and so they had to freeze

29:50.800 --> 29:51.800
their eggs.

29:51.800 --> 29:55.920
And I was just like, I was just, you know, as we've all had that moment where you're

29:55.920 --> 29:59.640
just sitting in public and a conversation just sort of comes to you, and you just sort

29:59.640 --> 30:01.560
of, you know, just enjoy it.

30:01.560 --> 30:04.680
So I just wrote it down and posted it on my account.

30:04.680 --> 30:09.120
You talked backstage about, I think the interesting part of this story, because then it goes from

30:09.120 --> 30:13.040
there, it's like, that's when you start to make people jealous and maybe draw some ire

30:13.040 --> 30:17.800
from the self-starters in the audience that haven't self-started yet, because like, from

30:17.800 --> 30:22.400
there it just like, it gets popular, and then you franchise it and you like, you got like

30:22.400 --> 30:26.280
five employees because you got, there's overheard London, there's overheard New York, and then

30:26.280 --> 30:31.240
you also do like these branded things with like Uber and what have you, like where you're

30:31.240 --> 30:35.960
actually, I mean, I, what I like to hear is these stories that start and within two years

30:35.960 --> 30:43.040
you've got a creative person or like, like that is paying their rent in a brand new fucking

30:43.040 --> 30:52.240
way that never existed and like without, it's like, we don't have to exploit labor or be

30:52.240 --> 30:56.920
billion, it's just like, you just, you just created a job for yourself with this, with

30:56.920 --> 31:03.240
this tool that is also often like the, the source of just dehumanization and misery,

31:03.240 --> 31:07.200
like it's the, this larger function is like, yeah, but you know, people, you could just

31:07.200 --> 31:12.920
make your own job, like Rob's selling t-shirts, he's making $2, ridiculing me, and

31:12.920 --> 31:13.920
$14.

31:13.920 --> 31:15.920
I make $2.

31:15.920 --> 31:16.920
Okay.

31:16.920 --> 31:17.920
Yeah.

31:17.920 --> 31:26.840
But anyways, but I, but I think the interesting thing is normal, regular friend dollars,

31:26.840 --> 31:30.120
so you're up, you're up 30 bones just from a couple of days ago.

31:30.120 --> 31:31.120
Bones, dude, that's amazing.

31:31.120 --> 31:32.120
Yes.

31:32.120 --> 31:33.120
I can use that word.

31:33.120 --> 31:34.120
What, bones?

31:34.120 --> 31:35.120
He's.

31:35.120 --> 31:36.280
But you make a great point.

31:36.280 --> 31:43.760
Like people love to hit it on Instagram and social media, but I mean, Instagram genuinely

31:43.760 --> 31:44.760
saved my life.

31:44.760 --> 31:45.760
Yeah.

31:45.760 --> 31:47.440
Like I was just a permanent fuck up the friend with potential.

31:47.440 --> 31:48.440
What is it interesting?

31:48.440 --> 31:53.240
There's just random difference between these platforms that Instagram didn't have in mind

31:53.240 --> 31:57.400
at all, like it, because this is a thing that works on Instagram.

31:57.400 --> 32:00.240
And as you said backstage, it wouldn't work on Twitter.

32:00.240 --> 32:01.240
It doesn't work.

32:01.240 --> 32:02.240
There's much better shit on Twitter.

32:02.240 --> 32:06.720
Twitter, Twitter is like all text based and your thing is text based, but your thing works

32:06.720 --> 32:11.120
on Instagram and where it is vastly monetizable.

32:11.120 --> 32:14.200
Nothing's monetizable on Twitter except like the presidency.

32:14.200 --> 32:15.200
You could, yeah.

32:15.200 --> 32:18.880
I mean, if you're playing for the big bucks, you can like make a lot of money on Twitter.

32:18.880 --> 32:23.800
But it's just interesting to me that also tonally, and maybe this is part of it, is that

32:23.800 --> 32:28.800
if you tweet that you overheard something, you're kind of a, you're almost more of a

32:28.800 --> 32:34.480
dick than an Instagram that like curates it in a classy kind of like way that's sort

32:34.480 --> 32:37.520
of like, this is a celebration of the city.

32:37.520 --> 32:41.240
And it's like, what's fascinating to me is why that works, like what the psychological

32:41.240 --> 32:42.240
routing is.

32:42.240 --> 32:43.240
Yeah.

32:43.240 --> 32:44.240
I don't know.

32:44.240 --> 32:45.840
My theory on, on Instagram, because I'm like, what if we don't overheard Ella?

32:45.840 --> 32:47.240
Because it's certainly not a new idea.

32:47.240 --> 32:51.840
You know, they're like the idea of anyone with a brain and, you know, a red Moleskine

32:51.840 --> 32:55.720
journal that they don't use has, you know, had that moment in public where someone said

32:55.720 --> 32:58.080
something weird and they've written it down.

32:58.080 --> 32:59.080
By the way, do you want to drink?

32:59.080 --> 33:00.320
I sometimes people.

33:00.320 --> 33:04.280
I've had like, I have two drinks a year and it's usually with a better drinker.

33:04.280 --> 33:05.280
Okay.

33:05.280 --> 33:06.280
Yeah.

33:06.280 --> 33:08.520
But yeah, I would take like a tiny amount, like a thimble.

33:08.520 --> 33:09.520
Like a.

33:09.520 --> 33:10.520
Can we get this man a thimble?

33:10.520 --> 33:11.520
Like a d20.

33:11.520 --> 33:12.520
A d20.

33:12.520 --> 33:13.520
Like a d20.

33:13.520 --> 33:16.240
Oh, nice to sneak in and try to play to the crowd.

33:16.240 --> 33:17.240
Yeah, man.

33:17.240 --> 33:18.840
I grew up rolling dice.

33:18.840 --> 33:19.840
Okay.

33:19.840 --> 33:20.840
It's true.

33:20.840 --> 33:21.840
We talked about it backstage.

33:21.840 --> 33:24.600
But we got deep.

33:24.600 --> 33:29.440
But the truth is, is that like overheard on Twitter, on Facebook, it's just, it's part

33:29.440 --> 33:35.360
of the maelstrom of whatever it, for some reason, doing it on Instagram, having it text

33:35.360 --> 33:37.960
only, having it sort of being, thank you.

33:37.960 --> 33:39.840
That's like a d100.

33:39.840 --> 33:41.560
Thank you.

33:41.560 --> 33:47.360
Having it be kind of enshrined as an image where you can geotag it and you can have details

33:47.360 --> 33:49.480
in the caption.

33:49.480 --> 33:52.640
So you have this sort of double experience where you're like, you read the thing and

33:52.640 --> 33:54.880
then you sort of go down and you go like, oh, you know, where was it?

33:54.880 --> 33:55.880
Do I know that place?

33:55.880 --> 33:56.880
Do I know that person?

33:56.880 --> 33:57.880
Do you still put your own in?

33:57.880 --> 34:01.240
Like when you hear one, do you drop your own overheards in there?

34:01.240 --> 34:05.840
I reserve about 2% of the account for myself, but not, you know, I mean, certainly at the

34:05.840 --> 34:11.480
beginning I was, you know, and I would imagine that some of it is genuinely overheard.

34:11.480 --> 34:14.440
Some of it is friends sitting around talking shit and sending it in.

34:14.440 --> 34:18.480
I sent you one that was two people that I was working with that were talking, but I

34:18.480 --> 34:19.480
still overheard it.

34:19.480 --> 34:20.480
I thought it was fun.

34:20.480 --> 34:25.320
It was like girls like talking to each other about setting each other up or whatever.

34:25.320 --> 34:31.360
And one of them, Nicole, was like, she's like so young that being set up is still fun.

34:31.360 --> 34:36.720
The idea of like, she's just saying to our friend Leslie Arfin, like, she's like, you

34:36.720 --> 34:42.280
get it, I keep telling you, you know, set me up with some of these nerdy guys and Leslie

34:42.280 --> 34:47.320
had some really, I don't know, in the room it was really funny, I was just listening

34:47.320 --> 34:48.320
to them.

34:48.320 --> 34:54.280
And she's like, yeah, but no, you don't understand, it's like they're actual nerds.

34:54.280 --> 34:59.280
It's gross, it's not like Rushmore.

34:59.280 --> 35:02.640
Real nerds, it's not marketable.

35:02.640 --> 35:06.040
Gav nerds, yeah.

35:06.040 --> 35:07.040
That's when I sent you that.

35:07.040 --> 35:11.920
I was like, I've never submitted anything to Overheard LA, I'm gonna do this and then

35:11.920 --> 35:16.880
I got this response from, I assume you, that was like, what are you doing submitting to

35:16.880 --> 35:17.880
my thing?

35:17.880 --> 35:18.880
I love your stuff.

35:18.880 --> 35:22.800
Yeah, like Dungeons & Dragons episode, community, why are you talking to me, that kind of stuff.

35:22.800 --> 35:26.480
And then you didn't use my Overheard quote, but it's, I mean, it does, because I'm not

35:26.480 --> 35:27.480
good at it.

35:27.480 --> 35:31.680
Obviously, what are the odds that I'm gonna be good at overhearing and also a genius and

35:31.680 --> 35:33.680
all these other things.

35:33.680 --> 35:37.920
I think I said in the show before, by the way, they overheard the two guys at the bar

35:37.920 --> 35:38.920
about vampires.

35:38.920 --> 35:40.440
Did I say that one?

35:40.440 --> 35:41.440
I can't remember.

35:41.440 --> 35:42.440
Say it.

35:42.440 --> 35:45.040
I walked into the burgundy room a long time ago and there was these two like kind of like

35:45.040 --> 35:48.960
rock and roll chicks at the bar and I walk up and this is all I heard.

35:48.960 --> 35:51.040
Why are vampires so hot?

35:51.040 --> 35:56.480
And the other guy says, duh, because they're thin.

35:56.480 --> 35:57.480
That's fucking good.

35:57.480 --> 36:02.320
Yeah, I can certainly understand why people think the account is bullshit because everything

36:02.320 --> 36:04.200
kind of becomes bullshit at some point.

36:04.200 --> 36:06.200
Well, I don't think, I hope you didn't get that message.

36:06.200 --> 36:09.760
No, no, no, no, no, but I mean, I'm just in terms of the comments and stuff like that.

36:09.760 --> 36:12.160
But I mean, I was, I actually have been overheard.

36:12.160 --> 36:17.640
Like I have sat somewhere at a cafe, spoken in a way that I thought was authentic but

36:17.640 --> 36:26.240
was actually incredibly embarrassing and douchey, and then have like some coy little cat person

36:26.240 --> 36:27.240
write my conversation down.

36:27.240 --> 36:29.400
Obviously, I try to keep my face away from the account.

36:29.400 --> 36:33.040
I think it's a more interesting account if it's not about a person and have her submit

36:33.040 --> 36:34.960
me to me an hour later.

36:34.960 --> 36:35.960
Right.

36:35.960 --> 36:36.960
Oh my God, that's insane.

36:36.960 --> 36:37.960
Yeah.

36:37.960 --> 36:41.800
So what, well, you've got to give us a specific, like what's the thing you said that you got?

36:41.800 --> 36:43.800
That is, that is really interesting.

36:43.800 --> 36:44.800
Yeah, yeah.

36:44.800 --> 36:49.240
I would vibrate something that's like, I just, you know, it's like asterisk, douchebag at

36:49.240 --> 36:51.920
Whole Foods or whatever, like, that's me.

36:51.920 --> 36:55.200
I'm looking for garlic stuffed olives.

36:55.200 --> 36:57.080
Well, there were two.

36:57.080 --> 37:03.320
There was one, I was sitting, I was sitting at Verve, VRV, Verve, whatever, I was sitting

37:03.320 --> 37:04.320
at Verve.

37:04.320 --> 37:05.320
I work there.

37:05.320 --> 37:09.840
And this was early days, and these two girls, they were like musicians, they were cool,

37:09.840 --> 37:10.840
whatever.

37:10.840 --> 37:14.800
And they sat down right next to me at Verve on Third Street, like right next to me, and

37:14.800 --> 37:19.240
they start, they just sort of like brought themselves, you know, into my space in the

37:19.240 --> 37:21.520
way that some people in LA do.

37:21.520 --> 37:24.520
And I guess there were musicians, they were like, God, I miss, I miss Sweden.

37:24.520 --> 37:27.400
It's just so much more authentic there.

37:27.400 --> 37:30.960
It's just like people in Europe just understand music, they just get it.

37:30.960 --> 37:34.160
And then, and then the other girl just leans in really seriously, and she's like, so what's

37:34.160 --> 37:36.680
your writing process?

37:36.680 --> 37:40.040
And I was just like, just fucking listening, I was like, whatever, you know, like, give

37:40.040 --> 37:44.280
me the fucking gold that's about to come from your deranged brain.

37:44.280 --> 37:48.740
And she's like, well, it sounds stupid, but like, have you heard of this Instagram account

37:48.740 --> 37:49.740
over her LA?

37:49.740 --> 37:51.240
And I was just like, huh?

37:51.240 --> 37:55.840
And I thought it was a sort of bit, and she starts saying that like, there was this post

37:55.840 --> 37:58.280
about glitter, and it was really funny.

37:58.280 --> 38:01.680
So she like went home and wrote a song about glitter, and I was just like sitting there

38:01.680 --> 38:05.960
and I was just like, okay, and then I posted that sort of like, you know, that's like a

38:05.960 --> 38:11.400
hall of mirrors, like you're like, you're like, you're seeing yourself in them bouncing back

38:11.400 --> 38:12.400
and forth.

38:12.400 --> 38:13.920
I remember something about that.

38:13.920 --> 38:17.960
I remember that being posted, I posted it and yeah, and then the other one I was like

38:17.960 --> 38:24.000
maybe a year ago, I was sitting at La Colombe in Silver Lake, and I was whining to my female

38:24.000 --> 38:28.880
friend about, you know, women in LA and how they date the same 12 celebrities and you

38:28.880 --> 38:34.160
know, this, you know, naming names and like, you know, the whole thing.

38:34.160 --> 38:35.960
And then she just kind of submitted it to me.

38:35.960 --> 38:41.320
I was like, oh, I was like, wow, I'm like a middle-aged douche, like, what's wrong with

38:41.320 --> 38:42.320
me?

38:42.320 --> 38:45.560
I was on a plane, maybe it's taught me if I mentioned this before, I was sitting on a

38:45.560 --> 38:50.760
plane and we're getting ready to like, the passenger is still boarding and so they haven't

38:50.760 --> 38:51.760
like closed the door yet.

38:51.760 --> 38:59.120
And there was an older gentleman behind me and he was on like, on his phone, like giving

38:59.120 --> 39:00.120
his will.

39:00.120 --> 39:05.560
And he's like, hello, my name is James Harden, and I did today's date is blah, blah, blah,

39:05.560 --> 39:06.560
so am I in a body.

39:06.560 --> 39:07.560
I'd like to amend my will.

39:07.560 --> 39:09.640
I'm going to change a couple of things.

39:09.640 --> 39:10.640
He started shaking it up.

39:10.640 --> 39:14.120
So-and-so was going to get the thing, but now I'm going to give it to So-and-so.

39:14.120 --> 39:18.120
I was like, I think every time he gets on a plane, it's like, oh, you know what, fuck

39:18.120 --> 39:19.120
Susan.

39:19.120 --> 39:25.060
But I wanna leave you back to me and go, hey man, is there something you know that I

39:25.060 --> 39:26.060
don't know what about this?

39:26.060 --> 39:30.560
I told Susan I was flying in Delta and she got dollar signs in her eyes.

39:30.560 --> 39:33.980
She's not getting a goddamn dime.

39:33.980 --> 39:36.800
Delta's a dangerous airline, it's-

39:36.800 --> 39:37.800
It is?

39:37.800 --> 39:39.720
I don't even care.

39:39.720 --> 39:41.520
I don't care what airline I affect negatively.

39:41.520 --> 39:48.520
except JetBlue, New York to L.A. or vice versa.

39:48.520 --> 39:51.520
That's a good one. That's the one I should take?

39:51.520 --> 39:53.520
I don't know. I think they're phased out.

39:53.520 --> 39:54.520
They're phased out.

39:54.520 --> 39:56.520
They've got caught being good or something.

39:56.520 --> 40:00.520
I've been taking Delta a lot lately. That's why I'm asking.

40:00.520 --> 40:03.520
Delta's the one that I really...

40:03.520 --> 40:05.520
Well, I mean, yeah.

40:05.520 --> 40:07.520
Delta's the one that sat me in coach.

40:07.520 --> 40:09.520
Give me a moment.

40:09.520 --> 40:11.520
Okay, okay. Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

40:11.520 --> 40:13.520
They're not John and Vinny's in coach.

40:13.520 --> 40:16.520
And they knew that you'd react that way

40:16.520 --> 40:18.520
so that they could get away with it.

40:18.520 --> 40:19.520
That's the thing that really pissed me off.

40:19.520 --> 40:20.520
I was like, all of a sudden, I'm just like,

40:20.520 --> 40:22.520
wait, why is my seat...

40:22.520 --> 40:25.520
And then I'm just like sitting with the, you know, the hoi-paloi.

40:25.520 --> 40:27.520
The what? The who? The who?

40:27.520 --> 40:29.520
The hoi-paloi. Okay.

40:29.520 --> 40:32.520
That's not what you call them.

40:32.520 --> 40:35.520
The flatsome, the fucking driftwood,

40:35.520 --> 40:39.520
the... The people, the... The constituency.

40:39.520 --> 40:43.520
The human beings. The civilians.

40:43.520 --> 40:46.520
Bernie Sanders sits there. Yeah.

40:46.520 --> 40:48.520
Yeah.

40:48.520 --> 40:50.520
And I was like, excuse me, what's the thing?

40:50.520 --> 40:52.520
But the guy in the...

40:52.520 --> 40:54.520
He just stood in the aisle and he made this big deal

40:54.520 --> 40:56.520
like projecting his voice.

40:56.520 --> 40:59.520
He knew exactly the kind of social leverage that he had

40:59.520 --> 41:03.520
that I was, a douchebag who got all the way to his seat

41:03.520 --> 41:05.520
before realizing they had fucked him over.

41:05.520 --> 41:08.520
And so he knew that everything that was being said

41:08.520 --> 41:10.520
was being overheard by everyone.

41:10.520 --> 41:12.520
I was going to have to sit next to you for six hours,

41:12.520 --> 41:15.520
wherever. And like, so he just fucking...

41:15.520 --> 41:17.520
It was like, they just fucked me over, man.

41:17.520 --> 41:20.520
It was like, it was like, it was like, oh,

41:20.520 --> 41:24.520
I wish you had brought it to our attention sooner.

41:24.520 --> 41:29.520
Brett, what? You changing my seat to a completely different...

41:29.520 --> 41:31.520
What? It was just so weird.

41:31.520 --> 41:33.520
And I was like, what would have happened if I had brought it

41:33.520 --> 41:35.520
to you earlier?

41:35.520 --> 41:39.520
Then you would have kicked someone out of first class

41:39.520 --> 41:41.520
that you overbooked.

41:41.520 --> 41:43.520
And he's like, no, he would have given you miles.

41:43.520 --> 41:45.520
Delta miles?

41:45.520 --> 41:48.520
I don't want Delta miles.

41:48.520 --> 41:51.520
I don't want to be on this plane.

41:51.520 --> 41:53.520
So you had to sit in coach?

41:53.520 --> 41:56.520
Yeah, next to a bunch of people who overheard

41:56.520 --> 41:59.520
that I'm a fucking asshole that thinks they're better than them.

41:59.520 --> 42:01.520
They're fucking...

42:01.520 --> 42:03.520
They'll grow my arm hair with these people.

42:03.520 --> 42:05.520
Yeah.

42:05.520 --> 42:09.520
Both people watching Avatar at different times.

42:09.520 --> 42:11.520
Fucking can't look away.

42:11.520 --> 42:13.520
I got to see the rest of Avatar.

42:13.520 --> 42:16.520
It's the only way to avert my eyes from fucking Avatar.

42:16.520 --> 42:18.520
But I mean, they're telling you that, hey,

42:18.520 --> 42:21.520
we just burned 3,000 of your dollars.

42:21.520 --> 42:23.520
I know. It's insane.

42:23.520 --> 42:25.520
Like, I never got recompense. I never...

42:25.520 --> 42:27.520
I mean, it's Delta...

42:27.520 --> 42:29.520
You know what their slogan should be?

42:29.520 --> 42:32.520
No recompense.

42:32.520 --> 42:34.520
No recompense.

42:34.520 --> 42:37.520
Don't expect any recompense here

42:37.520 --> 42:41.520
at Delta Airlines.

42:41.520 --> 42:44.520
It should be something in the area of whoever smelta.

42:44.520 --> 42:46.520
Uh...

42:46.520 --> 42:48.520
Whoever smelta.

42:48.520 --> 42:50.520
There's no airlines...

42:50.520 --> 42:52.520
Whoever smelta.

42:52.520 --> 42:54.520
There's no airlines that people talk about

42:54.520 --> 42:56.520
and have good things to say.

42:56.520 --> 42:58.520
People are like, wasn't Virgin...

42:58.520 --> 43:00.520
I don't know.

43:00.520 --> 43:02.520
And then they caught them being good.

43:02.520 --> 43:04.520
Now Virgin is just Alaska,

43:04.520 --> 43:06.520
but they got better lighting.

43:06.520 --> 43:08.520
They took all the cool shit away.

43:08.520 --> 43:11.520
Yeah, slowly the purple lights are probably dangling.

43:11.520 --> 43:14.520
I mean, man...

43:14.520 --> 43:17.520
Man, when I was coming back

43:17.520 --> 43:20.520
on Delta, man...

43:20.520 --> 43:23.520
Man, that was a rough landing.

43:23.520 --> 43:27.520
I was sitting next to somebody.

43:27.520 --> 43:29.520
I mean, I almost held his hand.

43:29.520 --> 43:31.520
It was like bumpy.

43:31.520 --> 43:35.520
And it was like somebody was throwing the plane up.

43:35.520 --> 43:37.520
And then it was coming down.

43:37.520 --> 43:39.520
And it was scary.

43:39.520 --> 43:41.520
So that's why I'm thinking like,

43:41.520 --> 43:43.520
you're on to something.

43:43.520 --> 43:47.520
Maybe this Delta isn't as good as they were saying.

43:47.520 --> 43:50.520
Because it was...

43:50.520 --> 43:54.520
I mean, when the pilot goes, people just hold on.

43:54.520 --> 43:56.520
That's not a great landing.

43:56.520 --> 43:58.520
Even for him.

43:58.520 --> 44:01.520
Like the emergency seats were popping out.

44:01.520 --> 44:03.520
The emergency seats...

44:03.520 --> 44:05.520
Here's something.

44:05.520 --> 44:07.520
I didn't know there were emergency seats

44:07.520 --> 44:09.520
until this flight.

44:09.520 --> 44:11.520
They pop out of the wall

44:11.520 --> 44:14.520
and the stewardesses...

44:14.520 --> 44:17.520
they sit in these emergency seats

44:17.520 --> 44:20.520
and they strap themselves in.

44:20.520 --> 44:24.520
And then they strap themselves into the flight workers.

44:24.520 --> 44:27.520
And it was...

44:27.520 --> 44:29.520
And the pilot's going,

44:29.520 --> 44:31.520
just hang on.

44:31.520 --> 44:33.520
Just hang on.

44:33.520 --> 44:37.520
And I'm wondering what's going on in the cockpit.

44:37.520 --> 44:41.520
I mean, hey, but it's a capitalist society.

44:41.520 --> 44:43.520
So all you gotta do is...

44:43.520 --> 44:45.520
No recompense.

44:45.520 --> 44:47.520
Take that money and take it over to United.

44:47.520 --> 44:49.520
And bring your dog.

44:49.520 --> 44:51.520
And for God's sakes,

44:51.520 --> 44:53.520
if they choose you by lottery

44:53.520 --> 44:55.520
to give your seat to a richer person,

44:55.520 --> 44:57.520
don't resist.

44:57.520 --> 44:59.520
They will beat your fucking ass

44:59.520 --> 45:01.520
and physically drag you off the plane.

45:01.520 --> 45:03.520
Of course, then United went out of business.

45:03.520 --> 45:05.520
Because if you were a cookie company

45:05.520 --> 45:07.520
and you suffocated a dog

45:07.520 --> 45:09.520
and beat a man senseless

45:09.520 --> 45:11.520
and dragged him out of your cookie factory

45:11.520 --> 45:13.520
in the same fiscal fucking quarter,

45:13.520 --> 45:15.520
you wouldn't be allowed

45:15.520 --> 45:17.520
to make cookies anymore.

45:17.520 --> 45:19.520
But it's an airline.

45:19.520 --> 45:21.520
So their profits probably went through the roof.

45:21.520 --> 45:23.520
I hate it. I hate it.

45:23.520 --> 45:25.520
And now we're finding out

45:25.520 --> 45:27.520
what I knew the whole time.

45:27.520 --> 45:29.520
Those things can't even stay in the air.

45:29.520 --> 45:31.520
They're held together with fucking speaking spells.

45:31.520 --> 45:33.520
They don't even...

45:33.520 --> 45:35.520
The pilots aren't even...

45:35.520 --> 45:37.520
They just get in there and hit a button

45:37.520 --> 45:39.520
like a Tesla and just go like,

45:39.520 --> 45:41.520
Alexa, take me to fucking Reno.

45:41.520 --> 45:43.520
And then the fucking...

45:43.520 --> 45:45.520
The planes are just going like now.

45:45.520 --> 45:47.520
They're just going, I saw a cloud.

45:47.520 --> 45:49.520
I think it's a truck.

45:49.520 --> 45:51.520
I better change lanes.

45:51.520 --> 45:53.520
And Donald Trump's like,

45:53.520 --> 45:55.520
oh, I should have run it on coal.

45:55.520 --> 45:57.520
We're all dead. We're dead, man.

45:57.520 --> 45:59.520
We're dead.

45:59.520 --> 46:01.520
We are dead.

46:01.520 --> 46:03.520
So anyways, like you...

46:05.520 --> 46:07.520
Well, yeah.

46:07.520 --> 46:09.520
It's a mystery in other words.

46:09.520 --> 46:11.520
I typically observe these things.

46:11.520 --> 46:13.520
It was a mystery why it is that

46:13.520 --> 46:15.520
some things work on Instagram

46:15.520 --> 46:17.520
and other things work on Twitter

46:17.520 --> 46:19.520
and other things work on a thing.

46:19.520 --> 46:21.520
It's just sort of a...

46:21.520 --> 46:23.520
All we know is that one piece of data

46:23.520 --> 46:25.520
that, well, this just works better on Instagram.

46:25.520 --> 46:27.520
Yeah, it was very much like

46:27.520 --> 46:29.520
it came from the right place

46:29.520 --> 46:31.520
and I guess it landed in the right place.

46:31.520 --> 46:33.520
We have a Twitter account,

46:33.520 --> 46:35.520
no one cares about.

46:35.520 --> 46:37.520
I've seen you sort of pop up and down on Twitter.

46:37.520 --> 46:39.520
You were on Twitter.

46:39.520 --> 46:41.520
I was on Twitter from 2009

46:43.520 --> 46:45.520
to the James Gunn firing.

46:45.520 --> 46:47.520
And then I was like, see ya.

46:47.520 --> 46:49.520
Until 2000. Well, he's back.

46:49.520 --> 46:51.520
Yeah, he's back.

46:51.520 --> 46:53.520
I'm not sliding back into that fucking sewer.

46:59.520 --> 47:01.520
You shouldn't, man.

47:01.520 --> 47:03.520
No, I shouldn't. I got...

47:03.520 --> 47:05.520
I'm agreeing with you.

47:05.520 --> 47:07.520
It's peaceful.

47:07.520 --> 47:09.520
I can still take enough Adderall

47:09.520 --> 47:11.520
that I'll yell at a fucking turd or whatever,

47:11.520 --> 47:13.520
but...

47:13.520 --> 47:15.520
You watch those dog memes, you know,

47:15.520 --> 47:17.520
like Chimkin, Doggo, Friend.

47:17.520 --> 47:19.520
Top-down cooking videos.

47:19.520 --> 47:21.520
I went through recently and I unfollowed

47:21.520 --> 47:23.520
everyone who wasn't following me.

47:25.520 --> 47:27.520
Including...

47:27.520 --> 47:29.520
Holy cow.

47:29.520 --> 47:31.520
There you go.

47:31.520 --> 47:33.520
I will be in about half an hour.

47:33.520 --> 47:35.520
I don't know if I...

47:35.520 --> 47:37.520
I mean, maybe some things like that.

47:37.520 --> 47:39.520
I wasn't like, well, they're not gonna...

47:39.520 --> 47:41.520
70 episodes...

47:41.520 --> 47:43.520
Of what?

47:47.520 --> 47:49.520
But it really is my only social media outlet.

47:49.520 --> 47:51.520
I deleted my Facebook account.

47:51.520 --> 47:53.520
I deleted my Twitter.

47:55.520 --> 47:57.520
I was thinking the other day that Twitter,

47:57.520 --> 48:00.520
it's like, there's not really any good outcome.

48:00.520 --> 48:02.520
Because, like, think about it.

48:02.520 --> 48:04.520
You like someone's tweet.

48:04.520 --> 48:06.520
Nothing happens. You don't feel great.

48:06.520 --> 48:08.520
You retweet someone's tweet.

48:08.520 --> 48:10.520
Nothing happens. You don't feel great.

48:10.520 --> 48:12.520
You retweet someone's tweet and someone else retweets it.

48:12.520 --> 48:14.520
Who cares? You retweet someone else's tweet

48:14.520 --> 48:16.520
and someone responds to it. Like, you get pissed off.

48:16.520 --> 48:18.520
You tweet something good. No one retweets it.

48:18.520 --> 48:20.520
Who cares? You retweet something good.

48:20.520 --> 48:22.520
A lot of people retweet it. It's like,

48:22.520 --> 48:24.520
okay, that feels kind of okay.

48:24.520 --> 48:26.520
Otherwise, people respond to you. It's like, this sucks.

48:26.520 --> 48:28.520
If it goes super viral,

48:28.520 --> 48:30.520
the whole... Everyone's screaming at you.

48:30.520 --> 48:32.520
So it's like, there's just no...

48:32.520 --> 48:34.520
Every single outcome, it's like a

48:34.520 --> 48:36.520
choose-your-own-adventure book that's just

48:36.520 --> 48:38.520
fuck you on every page.

48:38.520 --> 48:40.520
Yeah.

48:40.520 --> 48:42.520
I was thinking about it the other day.

48:42.520 --> 48:44.520
I was thinking that, like, I have the tendency

48:44.520 --> 48:46.520
to, like, create all these situations

48:46.520 --> 48:48.520
that I think will, like, go well.

48:48.520 --> 48:50.520
But the outcome is almost always

48:50.520 --> 48:52.520
just gonna be bad. And, like, there's one out of

48:52.520 --> 48:54.520
100 outcomes that's good.

48:54.520 --> 48:56.520
And it's like, well, why do that?

48:56.520 --> 48:58.520
Why not do something that's, like, 50-50 or something?

48:58.520 --> 49:00.520
Like, exactly that. It's like, there's one

49:00.520 --> 49:02.520
good outcome, which is, like, someone you like is,

49:02.520 --> 49:04.520
like, hey, you're really cool. But that, like,

49:04.520 --> 49:06.520
has never happened in the history of Twitter.

49:06.520 --> 49:08.520
Well, at least every single fleeting thought

49:08.520 --> 49:10.520
that you've ever had for 20 years

49:10.520 --> 49:12.520
is being slowly catalogued on a giant fucking

49:12.520 --> 49:14.520
reel-to-reel tape

49:14.520 --> 49:16.520
in a basement

49:16.520 --> 49:18.520
of a Capitol building that,

49:18.520 --> 49:20.520
obviously, just at any

49:20.520 --> 49:22.520
given time might be run by

49:22.520 --> 49:24.520
a person that decides to

49:24.520 --> 49:26.520
search all of this by

49:26.520 --> 49:28.520
people who ever called me a shithead

49:28.520 --> 49:30.520
and send out the drones.

49:30.520 --> 49:32.520
Like, that's what's terrifying to me

49:32.520 --> 49:34.520
is, like, this, like,

49:34.520 --> 49:36.520
when you, you know, like, the

49:36.520 --> 49:38.520
1930s in Germany

49:38.520 --> 49:40.520
when it was, like, there was a slow burn

49:40.520 --> 49:42.520
of, like, people were, like,

49:42.520 --> 49:44.520
you know, it's a march-violates thing

49:44.520 --> 49:46.520
where it's, like, people eventually

49:46.520 --> 49:48.520
going, like, oh, okay,

49:48.520 --> 49:50.520
sorry, I changed my mind.

49:50.520 --> 49:52.520
I think that's a great mustache.

49:52.520 --> 49:54.520
Like, they were just, like, freaking out

49:54.520 --> 49:56.520
and there was, like, this race to, like,

49:56.520 --> 49:58.520
redact and

49:58.520 --> 50:00.520
transpose, like, people's attitudes

50:00.520 --> 50:02.520
and, like, back then all you had was, like,

50:02.520 --> 50:04.520
a little bit of paperwork to fake.

50:04.520 --> 50:06.520
You could, like, pay people to give you a card,

50:06.520 --> 50:08.520
a membership card in the party

50:08.520 --> 50:10.520
that was, like, pre-backdated

50:10.520 --> 50:12.520
that you wouldn't be, like,

50:12.520 --> 50:14.520
a fucking march-violate.

50:16.520 --> 50:18.520
But now we're just, like,

50:18.520 --> 50:20.520
I mean, that's

50:20.520 --> 50:22.520
what terrifies me. I'm just, like, I've said it

50:22.520 --> 50:24.520
before. It's, like, it's too late.

50:24.520 --> 50:26.520
Like, I unplugged from all this stuff

50:26.520 --> 50:28.520
but I, it's not, like,

50:28.520 --> 50:30.520
I did it to, I just did it because

50:30.520 --> 50:32.520
I should, but now I'm just

50:32.520 --> 50:34.520
waiting 20 years to get

50:34.520 --> 50:36.520
shot by firing squad because

50:36.520 --> 50:38.520
I spent 20 years before I did that

50:38.520 --> 50:40.520
going, like,

50:40.520 --> 50:42.520
blah, blah, blah, blah,

50:42.520 --> 50:44.520
here's how I feel about everything

50:44.520 --> 50:46.520
and, like, not realizing

50:46.520 --> 50:48.520
that society was not going to continue

50:48.520 --> 50:50.520
towards, like, transparency

50:50.520 --> 50:52.520
as currency.

50:52.520 --> 50:54.520
But don't you think Trump fucked Twitter up?

50:54.520 --> 50:56.520
Like, Twitter was kind of fine and then

50:56.520 --> 50:58.520
Trump happened and then everyone

50:58.520 --> 51:00.520
that you sort of liked or respected

51:00.520 --> 51:02.520
just went fucking crazy on Twitter?

51:02.520 --> 51:04.520
Yeah, I mean, I don't know what chicken lays what egg.

51:04.520 --> 51:06.520
I mean, was it that, was it that

51:06.520 --> 51:08.520
Trump ruined Twitter or was it that

51:08.520 --> 51:10.520
Twitter creeped

51:10.520 --> 51:12.520
in on our, on us,

51:12.520 --> 51:14.520
like, and, like, just, like,

51:14.520 --> 51:16.520
installed itself somewhere between

51:16.520 --> 51:18.520
our pituitary gland and our cerebellum

51:18.520 --> 51:20.520
and, like,

51:20.520 --> 51:22.520
just changed the way we think

51:22.520 --> 51:24.520
until we were, like,

51:24.520 --> 51:26.520
microblogging and, like, this

51:26.520 --> 51:28.520
free-basing of fucking give me attention

51:28.520 --> 51:30.520
and here's the thing I have to say and

51:30.520 --> 51:32.520
then, as a byproduct

51:32.520 --> 51:34.520
of that, the, like,

51:34.520 --> 51:36.520
the most likely

51:36.520 --> 51:38.520
presidential candidate who'd been running

51:38.520 --> 51:40.520
for president for 25 years before that

51:40.520 --> 51:42.520
just, like, fell

51:42.520 --> 51:44.520
on that bread, like,

51:44.520 --> 51:46.520
like, you know,

51:46.520 --> 51:48.520
like, I mean, I don't know

51:48.520 --> 51:50.520
if you've ever seen a chicken

51:50.520 --> 51:52.520
in a kitchen and just, like,

51:52.520 --> 51:54.520
that Petrie dish was just there for him

51:54.520 --> 51:56.520
and so it's like, did he ruin Twitter?

51:56.520 --> 51:58.520
Did Twitter ruin us

51:58.520 --> 52:00.520
and grow him like a fungus?

52:00.520 --> 52:02.520
You don't have to answer.

52:02.520 --> 52:04.520
I mean, it's a chicken egg thing.

52:04.520 --> 52:06.520
It's like, it's like, it's both.

52:06.520 --> 52:08.520
It's just, this is what's happened to us.

52:08.520 --> 52:10.520
But I do think that at the very least

52:10.520 --> 52:12.520
when you're on Instagram, you're not really seeing

52:12.520 --> 52:14.520
a person for who they are.

52:14.520 --> 52:16.520
I like that people that are literally dicks,

52:16.520 --> 52:18.520
you can, like, click on their name and it's, like,

52:18.520 --> 52:20.520
99% of the time

52:20.520 --> 52:22.520
they're going to be a lot, they're locked

52:22.520 --> 52:24.520
and it's kind of like, if I was mature

52:24.520 --> 52:26.520
and I think I can become mature because I'm 46 now

52:26.520 --> 52:28.520
if something's got to give

52:28.520 --> 52:30.520
I could see myself

52:30.520 --> 52:32.520
by 50 being able to go,

52:32.520 --> 52:34.520
yeah, of course it's a locked account

52:34.520 --> 52:36.520
because they're a coward and they're a lot,

52:36.520 --> 52:38.520
they're saying that and they know that.

52:38.520 --> 52:40.520
They're saying that to themselves, like, you, you don't have to say that on Twitter.

52:40.520 --> 52:42.520
You don't have to, like, declare yourself

52:42.520 --> 52:44.520
a coward

52:44.520 --> 52:46.520
in order to, like, have a Twitter account

52:46.520 --> 52:48.520
that you use to just go,

52:48.520 --> 52:50.520
I think you're a fucking

52:50.520 --> 52:52.520
gross monster and, like, and then you click

52:52.520 --> 52:54.520
on the first thing and you see an egg

52:54.520 --> 52:56.520
and you see, like, two followers but, like,

52:56.520 --> 52:58.520
on Instagram, it's always, like, locked.

52:58.520 --> 53:00.520
It's always, like, a person

53:00.520 --> 53:02.520
that talks shit.

53:02.520 --> 53:04.520
Yeah, because they're terrified

53:04.520 --> 53:06.520
that you would, which I

53:06.520 --> 53:08.520
used to do, I would just go to someone's

53:08.520 --> 53:10.520
thing if it wasn't locked and I would just go through

53:10.520 --> 53:12.520
every fucking Instagram for three years

53:12.520 --> 53:14.520
and go, like, your dog sucks.

53:14.520 --> 53:16.520
Like, who cares that you went to St. Louis?

53:16.520 --> 53:18.520
Did that make you feel less of a loser?

53:18.520 --> 53:20.520
Fucking, like, nice cabbage.

53:20.520 --> 53:22.520
Did you grow it yourself? It must hate you.

53:22.520 --> 53:24.520
Like, just go through every

53:24.520 --> 53:26.520
single picture from their entire life

53:26.520 --> 53:28.520
and just, like, comment on it.

53:28.520 --> 53:30.520
Yeah, we've been pretty lucky with trolls.

53:30.520 --> 53:32.520
We don't have that many trolls but when we do,

53:32.520 --> 53:34.520
occasionally I lose my mind.

53:34.520 --> 53:36.520
Because, again, I'm not really part of the account

53:36.520 --> 53:38.520
but I run them all. But every once in a while

53:38.520 --> 53:40.520
I'll be like, you know, whatever the fuck

53:40.520 --> 53:42.520
they say and then, inevitably, click

53:42.520 --> 53:44.520
on their account and it's very rare that it's

53:44.520 --> 53:46.520
like, I'm a dermatologist.

53:46.520 --> 53:48.520
Here's my

53:48.520 --> 53:50.520
Patagonia. Proud father.

53:50.520 --> 53:52.520
I love my beautiful kids

53:52.520 --> 53:54.520
and we were just spearfishing in Indonesia

53:54.520 --> 53:56.520
and it's usually

53:56.520 --> 53:58.520
a follow ratio of 55 people

53:58.520 --> 54:00.520
following them and 5,000 people that

54:00.520 --> 54:02.520
they're following and just one

54:02.520 --> 54:04.520
fucking photo of a pancake or something.

54:04.520 --> 54:06.520
Yeah, a photo of a telephone pole or something.

54:06.520 --> 54:08.520
But, you know, I also find that people

54:08.520 --> 54:10.520
aren't really taking into consideration.

54:10.520 --> 54:12.520
You know, they're not sort of, I have this thing

54:12.520 --> 54:14.520
on my phone because I'm, you know,

54:14.520 --> 54:16.520
somewhat like you, like, just terribly reactive

54:16.520 --> 54:18.520
that says, pause and give constructive feedback

54:18.520 --> 54:20.520
and I ignore that every time.

54:20.520 --> 54:22.520
And I never pause and I never give

54:22.520 --> 54:24.520
constructive feedback. Do you respond

54:24.520 --> 54:26.520
to, like, trolls? Every once in a while

54:26.520 --> 54:28.520
I will drop a bomb on a troll for fun.

54:28.520 --> 54:30.520
But what's sad about it is, like, you know,

54:30.520 --> 54:32.520
it's all in good fun and then you'll actually

54:32.520 --> 54:34.520
see other people

54:34.520 --> 54:36.520
getting involved. What's the stuff that gets under

54:36.520 --> 54:38.520
your skin? Is it the fake thing?

54:38.520 --> 54:40.520
The fake stuff is annoying because it's like

54:40.520 --> 54:42.520
it's really just

54:42.520 --> 54:44.520
it's someone, you know, treating Instagram like Twitter.

54:44.520 --> 54:46.520
Yeah, I'm really sorry that I took part

54:46.520 --> 54:48.520
in that. But I also want to say that

54:48.520 --> 54:50.520
that's what I think is important message

54:50.520 --> 54:52.520
to you that I learned and then

54:52.520 --> 54:54.520
I said in that comment is that now I understand

54:54.520 --> 54:56.520
because I saw people, like, calling out

54:56.520 --> 54:58.520
that one that was, like, so believable.

54:58.520 --> 55:00.520
I'm like, okay, I think

55:00.520 --> 55:02.520
like, people that say

55:02.520 --> 55:04.520
this stuff to me, I never believe

55:04.520 --> 55:06.520
them, but maybe you'll hear it from me.

55:06.520 --> 55:08.520
I truly believe that

55:08.520 --> 55:10.520
the people that say this is fake, this is fake,

55:10.520 --> 55:12.520
they're expressing a love

55:12.520 --> 55:14.520
of your content.

55:14.520 --> 55:16.520
They're so hooked in, they're getting, I can

55:16.520 --> 55:18.520
speak for that personally, that the

55:18.520 --> 55:20.520
when I did that, when I said, like, this one's

55:20.520 --> 55:22.520
fake, the reason I did that

55:22.520 --> 55:24.520
is because of the respect

55:24.520 --> 55:26.520
that I have for the institution

55:26.520 --> 55:28.520
and you could easily...

55:28.520 --> 55:30.520
Well, you might feel that way, but I think to a lot of people it's just another meme account.

55:30.520 --> 55:32.520
You know, they don't have context

55:32.520 --> 55:34.520
and they're just looking at, you know, whatever is on Instagram.

55:34.520 --> 55:36.520
Yeah, I mean, look,

55:36.520 --> 55:38.520
look, I hate people that

55:38.520 --> 55:40.520
say look. Look!

55:40.520 --> 55:42.520
Just grabbing you by the scruff of your brain

55:42.520 --> 55:44.520
and look!

55:44.520 --> 55:46.520
But, I think

55:46.520 --> 55:48.520
the vast majority, I think

55:48.520 --> 55:50.520
you've got... I think you've got a little

55:50.520 --> 55:52.520
garden that people like to visit

55:52.520 --> 55:54.520
and stuff and like, I think that would

55:54.520 --> 55:56.520
like, I'm telling you

55:56.520 --> 55:58.520
I love it and I was

55:58.520 --> 56:00.520
like, it was an asshole. I didn't

56:00.520 --> 56:02.520
even think about until after I clicked

56:02.520 --> 56:04.520
I was like, I thought that I was like

56:04.520 --> 56:06.520
helping something

56:06.520 --> 56:08.520
like, you have a beautiful tomato garden

56:08.520 --> 56:10.520
and I'm like, this one's rotten!

56:10.520 --> 56:12.520
I don't even know what I was thinking.

56:12.520 --> 56:14.520
Yeah, and I'm sure there is one that's rotten.

56:14.520 --> 56:16.520
Like, there's no doubt that someone has sent something in

56:16.520 --> 56:18.520
and you know, I've literally asked them

56:18.520 --> 56:20.520
and I was like, oh, where'd you hear that? And they're like,

56:20.520 --> 56:22.520
in my mind. You know what I mean?

56:22.520 --> 56:24.520
Like, that doesn't work

56:24.520 --> 56:26.520
and today we got, you know, something really funny

56:26.520 --> 56:28.520
from Detroit, you know, and I'm like, well

56:28.520 --> 56:30.520
it's really funny. Like, that's good content.

56:30.520 --> 56:32.520
Do we not post it? Because

56:32.520 --> 56:34.520
you know how honorable meme account people are.

56:34.520 --> 56:36.520
I'm sure like, all the other meme account people

56:36.520 --> 56:38.520
that are like 23 year old, like

56:38.520 --> 56:40.520
you know, like

56:40.520 --> 56:42.520
you know, whatever

56:42.520 --> 56:44.520
something smart you would say, fill in the blank

56:44.520 --> 56:46.520
you know, have that

56:46.520 --> 56:48.520
there's no scruples and they troll Instagram

56:48.520 --> 56:50.520
and they, you know, grab content

56:50.520 --> 56:52.520
from this person and that person and repurpose it as their own

56:52.520 --> 56:54.520
and we try to have integrity

56:54.520 --> 56:56.520
you know, in this ridiculous

56:56.520 --> 56:58.520
you know, mini mall that we're in

56:58.520 --> 57:00.520
of content. But yeah

57:00.520 --> 57:02.520
I'm sure we've been tricked. You know, I'm sure like

57:02.520 --> 57:04.520
something from season 7

57:04.520 --> 57:06.520
episode 5 of the Mindy show got on there

57:06.520 --> 57:08.520
and we deleted it quickly. But yeah

57:08.520 --> 57:10.520
I appreciate your respect for it. Every time, like

57:10.520 --> 57:12.520
every time. But like, I'll think about, oh, that's really

57:12.520 --> 57:14.520
that's a great play on words.

57:14.520 --> 57:16.520
That's a funny little thought like idea

57:16.520 --> 57:18.520
and type it all up

57:18.520 --> 57:20.520
make it a perfect crafted tweet or whatever

57:20.520 --> 57:22.520
or caption to an Instagram

57:22.520 --> 57:24.520
thing or whatever. And then I go, you know what

57:24.520 --> 57:26.520
I'm just to be safe. I'm going to

57:26.520 --> 57:28.520
Google that. I'm going to type it in as is with quotes around

57:28.520 --> 57:30.520
Twitter Google or

57:30.520 --> 57:32.520
Google Twitter

57:32.520 --> 57:34.520
and

57:34.520 --> 57:36.520
it's already been done a thousand times. And one time

57:36.520 --> 57:38.520
I wrote some dumb joke like some very low hanging fruit

57:38.520 --> 57:40.520
like something was in the news or whatever and I just

57:40.520 --> 57:42.520
wrote something and like someone's like

57:42.520 --> 57:44.520
nice rip off of Jim Gaffigan

57:44.520 --> 57:46.520
bro. I'm like, I don't fucking

57:46.520 --> 57:48.520
listen to Jim Gaffigan. Fuck you

57:48.520 --> 57:50.520
when I have a

57:50.520 --> 57:52.520
idea like that some family and your happiness lately

57:52.520 --> 57:54.520
I've just been starting

57:54.520 --> 57:56.520
I'll Twitter Google it and then

57:56.520 --> 57:58.520
instead of just posting my

57:58.520 --> 58:00.520
joke, I'll just post a

58:00.520 --> 58:02.520
screenshot of the whole search and so you have

58:02.520 --> 58:04.520
like a bunch of people's half-assed attempts

58:04.520 --> 58:06.520
at the same kind of area and that makes

58:06.520 --> 58:08.520
me feel so much better because it's like

58:08.520 --> 58:10.520
I don't know if I could have done a better job than

58:10.520 --> 58:12.520
this, but it definitely wasn't good and

58:12.520 --> 58:14.520
neither are these people. So just look at that

58:14.520 --> 58:16.520
instead. There you go. I like

58:16.520 --> 58:18.520
that. Yeah, we get the same submission

58:18.520 --> 58:20.520
like probably three, four times a week

58:20.520 --> 58:22.520
for the last three years and I'm just

58:22.520 --> 58:24.520
always...

58:24.520 --> 58:26.520
It's just one that you can...

58:26.520 --> 58:28.520
Well, no, I mean...

58:28.520 --> 58:30.520
I'm sort of figuring out that you're the entire...

58:30.520 --> 58:32.520
They say a man in New York every 30 seconds

58:32.520 --> 58:34.520
a man gets mugged in New York. We're

58:34.520 --> 58:36.520
about to meet that man. Anyway, sorry.

58:36.520 --> 58:38.520
You're like, every for the last

58:38.520 --> 58:40.520
three years you've been getting the same submission every day.

58:40.520 --> 58:42.520
Yeah, I'm starting...

58:42.520 --> 58:44.520
Is there an

58:44.520 --> 58:46.520
overheard in LA thing that is actually

58:46.520 --> 58:48.520
one that just keeps coming in like month after month

58:48.520 --> 58:50.520
the same exact way? Yeah, yeah. Sorry, that's what I meant.

58:50.520 --> 58:52.520
We have an unpostable submission that we've never

58:52.520 --> 58:54.520
posted that is the stupidest should ever that everyone...

58:54.520 --> 58:56.520
And it's just basically going up to a

58:56.520 --> 58:58.520
valet parker and they're like, you know, do you need to be validated?

58:58.520 --> 59:00.520
Oh, right.

59:00.520 --> 59:02.520
We also get... But it probably

59:02.520 --> 59:04.520
is, I mean, because having been to a

59:04.520 --> 59:06.520
every time someone said, do you need

59:06.520 --> 59:08.520
validation? Yeah.

59:08.520 --> 59:10.520
I've been here 25 years and

59:10.520 --> 59:12.520
I've blocked

59:12.520 --> 59:14.520
out how many times I might have

59:14.520 --> 59:16.520
you know,

59:16.520 --> 59:18.520
like for the first two years,

59:18.520 --> 59:20.520
I've convinced myself I never

59:20.520 --> 59:22.520
I never did

59:22.520 --> 59:24.520
go like, you know, just do the word play

59:24.520 --> 59:26.520
like response, like do I need validation?

59:26.520 --> 59:28.520
Well, you know...

59:28.520 --> 59:30.520
Yeah, but like at least a more intelligent version of that where you

59:30.520 --> 59:32.520
expand on the validation you need

59:32.520 --> 59:34.520
related to your horrible experience.

59:34.520 --> 59:36.520
The other thing that occurred to me earlier is that

59:36.520 --> 59:38.520
that's the thing about LA

59:38.520 --> 59:40.520
especially, is that

59:40.520 --> 59:42.520
you do have a bunch of people

59:42.520 --> 59:44.520
like at any given time

59:44.520 --> 59:46.520
like how many

59:46.520 --> 59:48.520
improv buddies are sitting at this

59:48.520 --> 59:50.520
table, three tables from you

59:50.520 --> 59:52.520
who are like actually quite witty

59:52.520 --> 59:54.520
and like dry and like

59:54.520 --> 59:56.520
kind of performing almost

59:56.520 --> 59:58.520
like when they...

59:58.520 --> 01:00:00.520
Like writing a time travel movie at like

01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:02.520
Starbucks and Van Nuys.

01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:04.520
Yeah, and also just like kind of like

01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:06.520
one foot in and one foot out of themselves

01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:08.520
like because they're just funny

01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:10.520
people and they're kind of like

01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:12.520
I would buy that like LA

01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:14.520
overheard quotes are marginally

01:00:14.520 --> 01:00:16.520
like more unbelievable

01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:18.520
than on average because they're

01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:20.520
you could be listening to just like a group of

01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:22.520
100%

01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:24.520
and then you have the whole parenting part

01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:26.520
like you have the absurdity of

01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:28.520
you know

01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:30.520
children raising children with

01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:32.520
phones and iPads and like

01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:34.520
you know one of the best ones we ever had was like

01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:36.520
two kids at Pan Pacific Park and

01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:38.520
there was like, you know, go hide and text me when you're ready

01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:40.520
you know, and it's just like

01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:42.520
Oh, that's

01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:44.520
terrible. But I mean like

01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:46.520
why wouldn't that happen? You know what I mean?

01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:48.520
That's a real one? Oh, I mean

01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:50.520
that's fucking awesome.

01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:52.520
I mean that fucking just hurts the soul.

01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:54.520
It's a better than counting.

01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:56.520
Dismal. Text me when you're ready

01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:58.520
fuck off. I should have made a list

01:00:58.520 --> 01:01:00.520
of my favorite ones but I did not

01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:02.520
you didn't bring a list of like hits, did you?

01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:04.520
I mean I could just

01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:06.520
you know, you probably got them in your little head

01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:08.520
I'm sorry I said your head was low.

01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:10.520
It's in his phone. It's an Instagram account.

01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:12.520
Talking about my head like it's economy.

01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:14.520
It's a Delta head.

01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:16.520
He's a scroll food. I don't want

01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:18.520
Delta miles. Go through your phone

01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:20.520
and text us when you have a good one.

01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:24.520
Is there, well

01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:26.520
I don't want to distract you with this question but

01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:28.520
Sorry I'm on Instagram bro, what?

01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:30.520
I'll field this one.

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:32.520
Let's check in with Spencer while

01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:34.520
Jesse goes through and finds some of his favorites.

01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:36.520
I just meant for you to ask the question

01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:38.520
I can reel him off but anyway go ahead.

01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:40.520
Okay, well all right.

01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:42.520
Reel him off then.

01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:44.520
Give us some content.

01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:46.520
I like a lot of the short ones like you know

01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:48.520
I need to cancel my threesome

01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:50.520
is a good one that was

01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:52.520
sort of verified real and

01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:54.520
the people that got overheard like

01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:56.520
wrote in saying like oh my god that was me

01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:58.520
and I really did have a threesome and I couldn't make it.

01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:02.520
To interject on that

01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:04.520
I was at a bar one time and there was

01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:06.520
these three well-dressed

01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:08.520
like clubby kind of chicks

01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:10.520
and they were having a drink as the three of clubs

01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:12.520
and they were just talking and shooting

01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:14.520
the braids and another girl

01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:16.520
joins them and is like oh what a day

01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:18.520
like

01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:20.520
I forget the guys I don't say his name was Anthony

01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:22.520
just Anthony just destroyed

01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:24.520
my asshole like he just fucking

01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:26.520
just destroyed my asshole

01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:28.520
I said oh yeah he'll do that

01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:30.520
they were like yeah we don't tell me about it

01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:32.520
looking back

01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:34.520
they must be porn actresses

01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:36.520
whether they're in a cult

01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:38.520
they just clocked out

01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:40.520
they're like oh boy

01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:42.520
fucking just did 30 minutes with Anthony

01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:44.520
yeah fucking just the outtakes alone

01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:50.520
he never gets it one

01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:52.520
all the reshoots with Anthony

01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:54.520
never gets it in one

01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:56.520
he

01:02:58.520 --> 01:03:00.520
he always puts it in two

01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:02.520
yeah yeah yeah

01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:04.520
because he's fucking your asshole

01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:06.520
yes

01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:12.520
alright well let's start here

01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:14.520
that would make the account like that is more than worthy

01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:16.520
overheard on porn sets

01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:18.520
could be a thing

01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:20.520
I think one I was

01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:22.520
a good one from a long time ago was

01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:24.520
the amount of

01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:26.520
coke he gave me did not equal the amount

01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:28.520
of head I gave him

01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:30.520
oh

01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:32.520
if it's about a media reciprocity man

01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:34.520
it's not about the fun anymore

01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:36.520
you gotta do it because you like it

01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:38.520
I don't know what recompense means

01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:40.520
but there's probably a change about

01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:42.520
recompense and head

01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:44.520
I just say things louder

01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:50.520
you know what

01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:52.520
welcome to stay

01:03:52.520 --> 01:03:54.520
we got a real peek behind the curtain

01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:56.520
I'm shocked

01:03:56.520 --> 01:03:58.520
you handed that algorithm over

01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:02.520
putting yourself out of business

01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:04.520
secret sauce

01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:06.520
so bashful about it

01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:14.520
it's like if T-Pain was like

01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:16.520
auto-tune

01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:18.520
but by the way

01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:20.520
that's a derail

01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:22.520
but T-Pain

01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:24.520
most famously now like he went on

01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:26.520
that mass singer thing and it's like

01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:28.520
it's like that

01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:30.520
you went to art school

01:04:30.520 --> 01:04:32.520
those Picasso guys and the van go guys

01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:34.520
that make the scribble dudes and it looks like a kid

01:04:34.520 --> 01:04:36.520
drew it but they can all like

01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:38.520
actually they could like draw

01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:40.520
Benjamin Franklin if they wanted

01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:42.520
it would look like a photo

01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:44.520
T-Pain uses all that auto-tune

01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:46.520
but if he wanted to

01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:48.520
he could sound like Luther

01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:50.520
Van Dross

01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:52.520
he dominated that

01:04:52.520 --> 01:04:54.520
mass singer thing

01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:56.520
nobody knew it was him

01:04:56.520 --> 01:04:58.520
isn't that crazy

01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:00.520
I just can't believe that

01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:02.520
I felt good that you followed over at LA

01:05:02.520 --> 01:05:04.520
and now that you watch the mass singer

01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:06.520
I don't watch the mass singer but I follow T-Pain

01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:08.520
I love T-Pain

01:05:08.520 --> 01:05:10.520
do you follow his live tweeting of Game of Thrones?

01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:12.520
no

01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:14.520
well I'm not on Twitter

01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:16.520
it's too much of a net loss for me

01:05:16.520 --> 01:05:18.520
but just get someone else's account just for Sunday nights

01:05:18.520 --> 01:05:20.520
and he's just

01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:22.520
I wonder if he's

01:05:22.520 --> 01:05:24.520
LA based

01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:26.520
if he's like

01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:28.520
I bet I could get in there

01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:30.520
he's a big Rick and Morty fan

01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:32.520
like beyond

01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:34.520
like oh Chance the Rapper likes Rick and Morty

01:05:34.520 --> 01:05:36.520
it's like T-Pain

01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:38.520
for his birthday

01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:40.520
his wife made him a Rick and Morty cake

01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:42.520
like he's like

01:05:42.520 --> 01:05:44.520
he's really into Rick and Morty

01:05:44.520 --> 01:05:46.520
and I'm always trying to get Wisconsin

01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:48.520
swag from him because I'm from Wisconsin

01:05:48.520 --> 01:05:50.520
yeah they only had one like

01:05:50.520 --> 01:05:52.520
run at all that stuff and then they stopped selling it

01:05:52.520 --> 01:05:54.520
sorry I derailed this completely

01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:56.520
no please

01:05:56.520 --> 01:05:58.520
I love T-Pain's Instagram

01:05:58.520 --> 01:06:00.520
but you gotta like

01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:02.520
the thing happening right now is

01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:04.520
I can't see anything but is anyone

01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:06.520
familiar with this Game of Thrones?

01:06:06.520 --> 01:06:08.520
oh yeah

01:06:08.520 --> 01:06:10.520
screaming at Aria like live tweeting

01:06:12.520 --> 01:06:14.520
do you watch it live as you're watching the show?

01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:16.520
I don't interact with Twitter

01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:18.520
I don't know what live tweeting is

01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:20.520
or how people do that

01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:22.520
but I will go back

01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:24.520
and I will watch his sort of reactions

01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:26.520
to Game of Thrones

01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:28.520
and it is fucking amazing

01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:30.520
yeah I mean that was the big

01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:32.520
that was the tweet about

01:06:32.520 --> 01:06:34.520
that makes me miss Twitter the most

01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:36.520
is a Game of Thrones tweet which is like

01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:38.520
a live tweet where you're watching Game of Thrones

01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:40.520
and then somebody's tweet went kind of

01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:42.520
viral whatever you

01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:44.520
got the ratio hit that gap

01:06:44.520 --> 01:06:46.520
whatever you say

01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:48.520
through the roof while everyone's watching Game of Thrones

01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:50.520
everybody see this tweet that someone tweeted

01:06:50.520 --> 01:06:52.520
while they're watching Game of Thrones which is like

01:06:52.520 --> 01:06:54.520
oh here comes Jura

01:06:54.520 --> 01:06:56.520
yeah what's his name?

01:06:56.520 --> 01:06:58.520
Jura, when he appears on the

01:06:58.520 --> 01:07:00.520
he shows up and he's not supposed to follow

01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:02.520
the narrows around and he shows up

01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:04.520
on the Gladiator arena

01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:06.520
who wrote that?

01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:08.520
Oh great here comes Lord Jura from House Friend Zone

01:07:10.520 --> 01:07:12.520
it's just such a great

01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:14.520
like what a great peak moment of like

01:07:14.520 --> 01:07:16.520
it just represents for me

01:07:16.520 --> 01:07:18.520
as that added glee of you as a role

01:07:18.520 --> 01:07:20.520
player like it's like who would

01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:22.520
ever thunk that

01:07:22.520 --> 01:07:24.520
I mean that's such a great byproduct of all

01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:26.520
the shitty things in our world

01:07:26.520 --> 01:07:28.520
like the world is into fucking dragons and stuff

01:07:28.520 --> 01:07:30.520
like the whole world

01:07:30.520 --> 01:07:32.520
so like you know like people are just like

01:07:32.520 --> 01:07:34.520
yes bring your

01:07:34.520 --> 01:07:36.520
friend zone antics to

01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:38.520
our D&D milieu

01:07:38.520 --> 01:07:40.520
right

01:07:40.520 --> 01:07:42.520
well no but like I watched Game of Thrones

01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:44.520
last night

01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:46.520
I'm four episodes behind and I haven't watched Atlantic yet

01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:48.520
okay well I mean without revealing

01:07:48.520 --> 01:07:50.520
without revealing any spoilers

01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:52.520
yeah well I heard they had the battle of Winterfell

01:07:52.520 --> 01:07:54.520
so yeah apparently there was a battle of Winterfell

01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:56.520
I know the White Walkers won right

01:07:56.520 --> 01:07:58.520
so the rest of the season is just going to be them going like

01:07:58.520 --> 01:08:00.520
where's my skeleton horse

01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:02.520
who borrowed my skeleton

01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:04.520
horse

01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:06.520
you go

01:08:06.520 --> 01:08:08.520
on Twitter after and it just killed

01:08:08.520 --> 01:08:10.520
another horse Gary

01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:12.520
it's not that's not the

01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:14.520
point I rode that horse

01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:16.520
till it died

01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:18.520
it's my skeleton horse

01:08:18.520 --> 01:08:20.520
oh so there's property

01:08:20.520 --> 01:08:22.520
now maybe we should build a wall

01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:26.520
sorry I continue it's just

01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:28.520
it's the rest of this is like the better

01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:30.520
but okay good

01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:32.520
like the rest is like six episodes left

01:08:32.520 --> 01:08:34.520
of Game of Thrones it's just the White Walkers arguing

01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:38.520
yeah they break up

01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:40.520
into factions they're like I'm going to be a desert

01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:42.520
White Walker fine

01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:44.520
we'll call you

01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:46.520
yeah what are the weird priest White Walkers

01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:48.520
what would they get where were you going to call them

01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:52.520
we're calling what

01:08:52.520 --> 01:08:54.520
Eesa Walker okay cool

01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:56.520
go ahead I want to

01:08:56.520 --> 01:08:58.520
make a baby's eyes blue

01:08:58.520 --> 01:09:00.520
with my icicle finger

01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:02.520
how come Steve always gets

01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:04.520
to make baby's eyes blue with his icicle finger

01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:10.520
this is White Walker infighting

01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:12.520
this is the hashtag

01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:14.520
that you might want to use

01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:16.520
when you're celebrating the bit that I coined

01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:18.520
you know Rob

01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:20.520
Dan has a sketch he's working on

01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:22.520
because they're bringing mad tv back

01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:24.520
one of his characters

01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:26.520
that Dan is going to do in his audition

01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:28.520
is uh

01:09:28.520 --> 01:09:30.520
oh yeah

01:09:30.520 --> 01:09:32.520
Rob and Spencer

01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:34.520
it's very supporting of you Dan

01:09:34.520 --> 01:09:36.520
it's the coach

01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:38.520
it's a pregame pep talk

01:09:38.520 --> 01:09:40.520
for the White Walkers and this is the coach

01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:42.520
of the White Walkers

01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:44.520
getting the White Walkers ready to go

01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:46.520
into the big game

01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:48.520
what are the White Walkers

01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:52.520
you'll find out you'll find out in the sketch

01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:54.520
I'll put it all out there for you

01:09:54.520 --> 01:09:56.520
alright then

01:09:56.520 --> 01:09:58.520
I don't know if they could have made

01:09:58.520 --> 01:10:00.520
that show starting this year

01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:02.520
and just named

01:10:02.520 --> 01:10:04.520
you know the all white cast

01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:06.520
and then the White Walkers

01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:08.520
White privilege

01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:10.520
but it's called WIGHC

01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:12.520
oh my god the whites are coming

01:10:12.520 --> 01:10:14.520
no I mean it's shocking how

01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:16.520
resonant it got

01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:18.520
with the walls and the whites and the walking

01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:20.520
yeah

01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:22.520
it's so retroactively applicable

01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:24.520
it's like guys

01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:26.520
bigger fish to fry here

01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:28.520
stop arguing about whether or not

01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:30.520
the blah blah blah

01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:32.520
alright well I have to yes and Jeff's

01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:34.520

01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:42.520
White Walker coach

01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:44.520
White Walker coach at halftime

01:10:44.520 --> 01:10:46.520
oh

01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:50.520
gentlemen

01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:56.520
where do I start

01:10:58.520 --> 01:11:00.520
we came here

01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:04.520
to enslave humanity

01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:06.520
and bind it

01:11:06.520 --> 01:11:08.520
in a magical frost

01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:10.520
I don't know if that's true

01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:14.520
I don't know what their goal is

01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:16.520
yardage

01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:18.520
talk about yardage

01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:20.520
I don't think you understand

01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:22.520
who you are

01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:26.520
I'm seeing you

01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:28.520
white

01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:32.520
and I haven't seen

01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:34.520
a single one of you walk

01:11:34.520 --> 01:11:36.520
you

01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:40.520
you may think that you've walked

01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:42.520
from wildling territory

01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:44.520
to winterfell

01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:46.520
you may think that you've walked across

01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:48.520
ice and fallen through it

01:11:48.520 --> 01:11:50.520
you may think that you've

01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:52.520
risen

01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:54.520
that you've screamed

01:11:54.520 --> 01:11:56.520
and run full speed at your former friends

01:11:56.520 --> 01:11:58.520
confusing them

01:11:58.520 --> 01:12:00.520
taking advantage of their mortal

01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:02.520
familiarities as you

01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:04.520
bit into their ribcages

01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:06.520
swelling our ranks

01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:10.520
before I'm standing

01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:12.520
you ain't done shit

01:12:14.520 --> 01:12:16.520
my skin is blue

01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:18.520
I have a crown of ice

01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:20.520
I ride a skeleton horse

01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:24.520
and right now

01:12:24.520 --> 01:12:26.520
I'd like to roll over and

01:12:26.520 --> 01:12:28.520
die

01:12:28.520 --> 01:12:30.520
I wish I could go to Doran

01:12:30.520 --> 01:12:32.520
and drink a wine cooler

01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:38.520
you call what you're doing out there

01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:40.520
white walking

01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:46.520
let's just quit right now

01:12:46.520 --> 01:12:48.520
we're just not too late

01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:50.520
let's white walk back to the south

01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:52.520
let's just hang out

01:12:52.520 --> 01:12:54.520
and fucking do whatever we want

01:12:54.520 --> 01:12:56.520
we'll roll around in the snow

01:12:56.520 --> 01:12:58.520
we'll let Peter Dinklage

01:12:58.520 --> 01:13:00.520
and then the lady from Terminator 4

01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:04.520
hang out

01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:06.520
they can advise each other

01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:08.520
they can consult with

01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:10.520
their hands of their kings

01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:12.520
make their fire

01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:14.520
water in their fucking

01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:16.520
dragon eggs

01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:18.520
museums

01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:22.520
or you can suck it up

01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:26.520
and get cold

01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:28.520
now what's it gonna be

01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:34.520
excuse me

01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:36.520
alright come on Jeff

01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:38.520
I did the best I could

01:13:38.520 --> 01:13:40.520
yay

01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:44.520
yeah I know

01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:46.520
I know sarcasm

01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:48.520
no it was good

01:13:48.520 --> 01:13:50.520
no shut up

01:13:50.520 --> 01:13:52.520
I haven't watched any of the season

01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:54.520
alright Jesse give us some more

01:13:54.520 --> 01:13:56.520
of a classic

01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:04.520
just give us a stinger

01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:06.520
give us a good one

01:14:06.520 --> 01:14:08.520
give you a dinger

01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:10.520

01:14:10.520 --> 01:14:12.520
oh yeah

01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:14.520
let's find it

01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:16.520
what's your instagram

01:14:16.520 --> 01:14:18.520
Dan Harmon

01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:20.520
white walker 85

01:14:20.520 --> 01:14:22.520
Daniel

01:14:22.520 --> 01:14:24.520
you already told us about

01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:26.520
yeah

01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:28.520
I can't remember it

01:14:28.520 --> 01:14:30.520
it's not good

01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:32.520
it's gonna humiliate me

01:14:32.520 --> 01:14:34.520
I have the chucky cheese

01:14:34.520 --> 01:14:36.520
of wireless carriers

01:14:36.520 --> 01:14:38.520
the signal is no good here

01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:40.520
sorry

01:14:40.520 --> 01:14:42.520
we only did it for 11 instagrams

01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:44.520
that's the name of the book

01:14:44.520 --> 01:14:46.520
yeah we did a book

01:14:46.520 --> 01:14:48.520
which we're not here to talk about

01:14:48.520 --> 01:14:50.520
but we only did it for 11 instagrams

01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:52.520
you're anti-plugging your book

01:14:52.520 --> 01:14:54.520
but you're excited about your newspaper

01:14:54.520 --> 01:14:56.520
yeah we just launched a newspaper a couple weeks ago

01:14:56.520 --> 01:14:58.520
because digital is dead

01:14:58.520 --> 01:15:00.520
yeah

01:15:00.520 --> 01:15:02.520
real life is coming back

01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:04.520
a newspaper what do you mean

01:15:04.520 --> 01:15:06.520
we launched a local newspaper

01:15:06.520 --> 01:15:08.520
we made about 12,000 of them and they were in like 50 locations

01:15:08.520 --> 01:15:10.520
like sort of down to earth

01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:12.520
like blue collar spots

01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:14.520
like intelligentsia

01:15:14.520 --> 01:15:16.520
and

01:15:16.520 --> 01:15:18.520
Erwan

01:15:18.520 --> 01:15:20.520
you know

01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:22.520
verve coffee

01:15:22.520 --> 01:15:24.520
but it's sort of instagramable on the outside

01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:26.520
with bits by comedy writers on the inside

01:15:26.520 --> 01:15:28.520
we had a millennial weather report

01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:30.520
with earth's current mood

01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:32.520
we had

01:15:32.520 --> 01:15:34.520
like comic strips

01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:36.520
with instagram artists

01:15:36.520 --> 01:15:38.520
so obviously comparisons to the onion

01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:40.520
are gonna arrive here

01:15:40.520 --> 01:15:42.520
we're never gonna touch the onion

01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:44.520
it's one of the greatest things ever

01:15:44.520 --> 01:15:46.520
it was sort of half satire

01:15:46.520 --> 01:15:48.520
half editorial

01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:50.520
never gonna touch the onion

01:15:50.520 --> 01:15:52.520
never gonna touch the onion

01:15:52.520 --> 01:15:54.520
and it would be a good t-pain song

01:15:58.520 --> 01:16:00.520
never gonna touch the

01:16:00.520 --> 01:16:02.520
onion

01:16:04.520 --> 01:16:06.520
continue

01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:08.520
yeah we had a vegan go to animal

01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:10.520
the nose to tail spot

01:16:10.520 --> 01:16:12.520
on Fairfax

01:16:12.520 --> 01:16:14.520
nose to tail spot

01:16:14.520 --> 01:16:16.520
you talk like this all the time

01:16:16.520 --> 01:16:18.520
it's a nose to tail spot

01:16:18.520 --> 01:16:20.520
I assume what that is

01:16:20.520 --> 01:16:22.520
you eat all of it

01:16:22.520 --> 01:16:24.520
it's Chinatown but for white people

01:16:24.520 --> 01:16:26.520
is the appeal of it that you're somehow

01:16:26.520 --> 01:16:28.520
being like more tastefully carnivorous

01:16:28.520 --> 01:16:30.520
because you're actually eating the entire animal

01:16:30.520 --> 01:16:32.520
or is that a thing

01:16:32.520 --> 01:16:34.520
well I think it's more sort of conscious

01:16:34.520 --> 01:16:36.520
like you know if you're a hunter

01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:38.520
and you eat something like you're making the most

01:16:38.520 --> 01:16:40.520
of the animal you're not letting any of it go to waste

01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:42.520
but I mean if you sit at a table

01:16:42.520 --> 01:16:44.520
are they like do they come over

01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:46.520
and go welcome to nose to tail do you know how it works here

01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:48.520
no I've never actually said nose to tail out loud

01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:50.520
until today

01:16:50.520 --> 01:16:52.520
I have read it but I think it's just

01:16:52.520 --> 01:16:54.520
places where you can get pigs feet

01:16:54.520 --> 01:16:56.520
okay so it's about the volume

01:16:56.520 --> 01:16:58.520
of offering

01:16:58.520 --> 01:17:00.520
they use the whole animal

01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:02.520
creatively but yeah we had a vegan go there

01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:04.520
and sort of do a review

01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:06.520
so you know

01:17:06.520 --> 01:17:08.520
yeah it's fun we're launching in New York

01:17:08.520 --> 01:17:10.520
we're looking forward to your

01:17:10.520 --> 01:17:12.520
walker advice column

01:17:12.520 --> 01:17:14.520
that was the most

01:17:14.520 --> 01:17:16.520
recent project

01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:18.520
when you turn a baby's eyes blue

01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:20.520
with your icicle finger

01:17:20.520 --> 01:17:22.520
you've got to be careful not to

01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:24.520
kill the baby

01:17:24.520 --> 01:17:26.520
I mean you want to kill it

01:17:26.520 --> 01:17:28.520
to the extent that it becomes

01:17:28.520 --> 01:17:30.520
a white walker

01:17:30.520 --> 01:17:32.520
anyways

01:17:32.520 --> 01:17:34.520
did you know that it's white walkers

01:17:34.520 --> 01:17:36.520
that white walkers is like the color white

01:17:36.520 --> 01:17:38.520
and walker but then the

01:17:38.520 --> 01:17:40.520
people that are in charge like the Rob Schrab

01:17:40.520 --> 01:17:42.520
looking guys that are in charge of all the

01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:44.520
they're blue they all look like Rob Schrab

01:17:44.520 --> 01:17:46.520
by the way

01:17:46.520 --> 01:17:48.520
the main guy does

01:17:48.520 --> 01:17:50.520
not as like weird priest horseman

01:17:50.520 --> 01:17:52.520
but the main guy

01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:54.520
I think they all look like Schropp but so do all the

01:17:54.520 --> 01:17:56.520
hellraisers all the hellraisers look like Schropp

01:17:56.520 --> 01:17:58.520
not just Pinhead

01:17:58.520 --> 01:18:00.520
I think they look like a crew of meth heads who listen to

01:18:00.520 --> 01:18:02.520
Blink 182 and like live in Santa Clarita

01:18:02.520 --> 01:18:04.520
like they all have long coats

01:18:04.520 --> 01:18:06.520
there's an electrical tape like matrix gowns

01:18:06.520 --> 01:18:08.520
yeah and they look like that guy

01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:10.520
I think he recently passed away but he was like

01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:12.520
you know twisted fire starter like that guy

01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:14.520
kind of sort of looks like that guy

01:18:14.520 --> 01:18:16.520
I just I hate that their origins

01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:18.520
I'm excited that the battle of Winterfell happened

01:18:18.520 --> 01:18:20.520
which I assume is white walkers versus mortals

01:18:20.520 --> 01:18:22.520
and that I'm like I

01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:24.520
it's not what happens

01:18:24.520 --> 01:18:26.520
Jon Snow just destroys Sansa's ass

01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:28.520
and it's like

01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:30.520
he destroyed my ass

01:18:30.520 --> 01:18:32.520
it was such a snog

01:18:32.520 --> 01:18:34.520
I'm just going to find your submission

01:18:36.520 --> 01:18:38.520
yeah I already heard that like Aria

01:18:38.520 --> 01:18:40.520
wait wait what's her name

01:18:40.520 --> 01:18:42.520
Aria

01:18:42.520 --> 01:18:44.520
I heard that an early

01:18:44.520 --> 01:18:46.520
an early event

01:18:46.520 --> 01:18:48.520
his

01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:50.520
witness to her coming of age

01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:54.520
yeah my friend screamed when that happened

01:18:54.520 --> 01:18:56.520
he's a 49 year old

01:18:56.520 --> 01:18:58.520
writer

01:18:58.520 --> 01:19:00.520
successful screenwriter

01:19:00.520 --> 01:19:02.520
watching a group of like 15

01:19:02.520 --> 01:19:04.520
and she sort of started to take her pants off

01:19:04.520 --> 01:19:06.520
and they did like just one little shot

01:19:06.520 --> 01:19:08.520
of the top eighth of her butt

01:19:08.520 --> 01:19:10.520
and he was like I've known you since you were a little girl

01:19:10.520 --> 01:19:12.520
yeah exactly

01:19:12.520 --> 01:19:14.520
I just picture these living rooms full of people

01:19:14.520 --> 01:19:16.520
with white wine and like all this silence

01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:18.520
and you just hear crackling fireplace

01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:20.520
and panting

01:19:20.520 --> 01:19:22.520
and then one 48 year old

01:19:22.520 --> 01:19:24.520
person goes like go girl

01:19:26.520 --> 01:19:28.520
and then everyone's like okay I guess this is happening

01:19:28.520 --> 01:19:30.520
I get it

01:19:32.520 --> 01:19:34.520
because I don't know how I would process that

01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:36.520
it just feel like we raised her

01:19:36.520 --> 01:19:38.520
but you haven't seen the actual scene

01:19:38.520 --> 01:19:40.520
no I haven't I haven't seen this entire season

01:19:40.520 --> 01:19:42.520
or Atlanta

01:19:42.520 --> 01:19:44.520
Cody's not

01:19:44.520 --> 01:19:46.520
Cody's

01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:48.520
you know it's like

01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:50.520
unless Cody and I are both like gung-ho

01:19:50.520 --> 01:19:52.520
about something it probably won't happen

01:19:52.520 --> 01:19:54.520
it'll just like

01:19:54.520 --> 01:19:56.520
Cody and I are both

01:19:56.520 --> 01:19:58.520
at a given time are not like

01:19:58.520 --> 01:20:00.520
fucking thrones let's do it

01:20:00.520 --> 01:20:02.520
it's because I know

01:20:02.520 --> 01:20:04.520
they're wrapping it up

01:20:04.520 --> 01:20:06.520
I think it's one of the greatest series in the history of television

01:20:06.520 --> 01:20:08.520
but it's like it's a serialized series

01:20:08.520 --> 01:20:10.520
and it's about all these like cataclysmic events

01:20:10.520 --> 01:20:12.520
like coming you know

01:20:12.520 --> 01:20:14.520
I just have some of the worst acting of all time as well

01:20:14.520 --> 01:20:16.520
no like

01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:18.520
who do you think the bad actors are?

01:20:18.520 --> 01:20:20.520
well I mean I can't act but like I feel like

01:20:20.520 --> 01:20:22.520
a lot of the great actors

01:20:22.520 --> 01:20:24.520
are already dead like you know

01:20:24.520 --> 01:20:26.520
Kyle's dance was amazing

01:20:26.520 --> 01:20:28.520
the Tyrell grandmother

01:20:28.520 --> 01:20:30.520
yeah she was great

01:20:30.520 --> 01:20:32.520
she was amazing Tyrion in season one

01:20:32.520 --> 01:20:34.520
was the greatest actor ever and now he's just sort of like walks around

01:20:34.520 --> 01:20:36.520
and you're like where's my accent

01:20:36.520 --> 01:20:38.520
and how do I dance?

01:20:38.520 --> 01:20:40.520
Shots fired

01:20:40.520 --> 01:20:42.520
yeah I mean I don't know

01:20:42.520 --> 01:20:44.520
I just love

01:20:44.520 --> 01:20:46.520
I guess it's sort of like David Mamet movies

01:20:46.520 --> 01:20:48.520
where it's like

01:20:48.520 --> 01:20:50.520
well who cares if Campbell Scott

01:20:50.520 --> 01:20:52.520
like it's like obviously

01:20:52.520 --> 01:20:54.520
David Mamet's like get me Campbell Scott

01:20:54.520 --> 01:20:56.520
and that is like Campbell do that thing

01:20:56.520 --> 01:20:58.520
where you stare straight ahead

01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:00.520
and read all of my dialogue

01:21:00.520 --> 01:21:02.520
every word matters

01:21:02.520 --> 01:21:04.520
okay we're gonna do another take

01:21:04.520 --> 01:21:06.520
you moved your eyebrow once

01:21:06.520 --> 01:21:08.520
it distracts from my words

01:21:08.520 --> 01:21:10.520
go

01:21:10.520 --> 01:21:12.520
more Campbell less Scott

01:21:12.520 --> 01:21:14.520
and he kind of like has his wheelhouse of like actors

01:21:14.520 --> 01:21:16.520
and sorry I

01:21:16.520 --> 01:21:18.520
feel like when I watch Game of Thrones

01:21:18.520 --> 01:21:20.520
I'm like I don't care if they

01:21:20.520 --> 01:21:22.520
spit out you know they're doing like a table

01:21:22.520 --> 01:21:24.520
but I mean it's one of the greatest shows I've ever seen

01:21:24.520 --> 01:21:26.520
but it's also like one of those cultural moments

01:21:26.520 --> 01:21:28.520
now where you're actually like

01:21:28.520 --> 01:21:30.520
I walked into work and one of my colleagues

01:21:30.520 --> 01:21:32.520
had not watched it

01:21:32.520 --> 01:21:34.520
you know she's a big fan and I'm like what the fuck are you doing

01:21:34.520 --> 01:21:36.520
like there's no spoiler alert time here

01:21:36.520 --> 01:21:38.520
like everyone's freaking out because

01:21:38.520 --> 01:21:40.520
killed

01:21:40.520 --> 01:21:42.520
right and

01:21:42.520 --> 01:21:44.520
it reminds me of the

01:21:44.520 --> 01:21:46.520
yeah like

01:21:46.520 --> 01:21:48.520
Rob Starks ghost kills

01:21:48.520 --> 01:21:50.520
the dog

01:21:50.520 --> 01:21:52.520
but it reminds me of the Sopranos

01:21:52.520 --> 01:21:54.520
like when will there be epic television like this

01:21:54.520 --> 01:21:56.520
where everyone's sort of on board

01:21:56.520 --> 01:21:58.520
and watching Trump is the only other thing

01:21:58.520 --> 01:22:00.520
and I think we've talked about this

01:22:00.520 --> 01:22:02.520
like every year

01:22:02.520 --> 01:22:04.520
with HBO because it was sort of like

01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:06.520
the streak of and it was like

01:22:06.520 --> 01:22:08.520
what's the secret over there

01:22:08.520 --> 01:22:10.520
which executive is bringing the magic

01:22:10.520 --> 01:22:12.520
and

01:22:12.520 --> 01:22:14.520
but now I think we can truly say

01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:16.520
you're not gonna

01:22:16.520 --> 01:22:18.520
there's gonna be the end of this HBO

01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:20.520
era of prestige

01:22:20.520 --> 01:22:22.520
television because of the AT&T

01:22:22.520 --> 01:22:24.520
buying everything and like

01:22:24.520 --> 01:22:26.520
they're gonna merge HBO with like

01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:28.520
a bunch of shit and just call it

01:22:28.520 --> 01:22:30.520
HBO and that's what my old boss

01:22:30.520 --> 01:22:32.520
Bob Greenblatt's gonna be in charge of and I don't

01:22:32.520 --> 01:22:34.520
I just don't see that like

01:22:34.520 --> 01:22:36.520
there's no longer gonna be this like

01:22:36.520 --> 01:22:38.520
weird little cottage where they

01:22:38.520 --> 01:22:40.520
they would buy these

01:22:40.520 --> 01:22:42.520
things where they're like that sounds like a

01:22:42.520 --> 01:22:44.520
crazy idea but if you invested

01:22:44.520 --> 01:22:46.520
a bunch of money in it it was like a weird

01:22:46.520 --> 01:22:48.520
world to build like when are we ever gonna see

01:22:48.520 --> 01:22:50.520
any of these crazy like

01:22:50.520 --> 01:22:52.520
where's Creep Shogunate Rob? Shutter

01:22:52.520 --> 01:22:54.520
Shutter maybe that's the new thing

01:22:54.520 --> 01:22:56.520
maybe that's the new thing

01:22:56.520 --> 01:22:58.520
first in 10 the bulls mean business

01:23:00.520 --> 01:23:02.520
but then you see what's coming out and it's

01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:04.520
like Westworld and his dark materials

01:23:04.520 --> 01:23:06.520
and they're doing Deadwood

01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:08.520
like maybe that's

01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:10.520
two years from now

01:23:10.520 --> 01:23:12.520
well that's stuff that they've already gotten

01:23:12.520 --> 01:23:14.520
I'm saying like who's who

01:23:14.520 --> 01:23:16.520
I'm talking about it's it's gonna be over

01:23:16.520 --> 01:23:18.520
after that like the

01:23:18.520 --> 01:23:20.520
Deadwood movie and all the stuff it's like

01:23:20.520 --> 01:23:22.520
it's kind of the end it's an end of I don't

01:23:22.520 --> 01:23:24.520
know 20 30 years

01:23:24.520 --> 01:23:26.520
what is it like HBO making this amazing

01:23:30.520 --> 01:23:32.520
stuff where like they're only and it's just

01:23:32.520 --> 01:23:34.520
when you think they're gonna zig they zag kind of thing

01:23:34.520 --> 01:23:36.520
where they're you know they don't they don't go

01:23:36.520 --> 01:23:38.520
like well we love mafia stories

01:23:38.520 --> 01:23:40.520
so let's buy three more Sopranos things

01:23:40.520 --> 01:23:42.520
they just like obviously they're

01:23:42.520 --> 01:23:44.520
they have like they have like this taste

01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:46.520
over there where they're like as long as

01:23:46.520 --> 01:23:48.520
you create a world for me that I'm interested in

01:23:48.520 --> 01:23:50.520
want to be immersed in and like

01:23:50.520 --> 01:23:52.520
what what other network is ever going to

01:23:52.520 --> 01:23:54.520
provide that environment for some of the

01:23:54.520 --> 01:23:56.520
craziest like

01:23:56.520 --> 01:23:58.520
writers true TV

01:23:58.520 --> 01:24:00.520
true TV and I think that's it

01:24:02.520 --> 01:24:04.520
anyways all right moving on

01:24:04.520 --> 01:24:06.520
good getting into the leg of the show

01:24:06.520 --> 01:24:08.520
where I'm too drunk to be entertaining

01:24:08.520 --> 01:24:10.520
not that the first

01:24:10.520 --> 01:24:12.520
two-thirds of the show are entertaining but

01:24:14.520 --> 01:24:16.520
you want to hit us with another great

01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:18.520
over here at LA quote oh yeah

01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:20.520

01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:32.520
coke class yeah that was close

01:24:32.520 --> 01:24:34.520
is one was like don't vape

01:24:34.520 --> 01:24:36.520
all over the charcuterie board I feel like

01:24:36.520 --> 01:24:38.520
that's the same thing that's awesome

01:24:38.520 --> 01:24:40.520
who are this is loosely related but like

01:24:40.520 --> 01:24:42.520
you vape on the charcuterie board no

01:24:42.520 --> 01:24:44.520
but who who are these

01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:46.520
people I don't

01:24:46.520 --> 01:24:48.520
and I don't want to offend anybody that is one of these people

01:24:48.520 --> 01:24:50.520
because obviously they outnumber me but like

01:24:50.520 --> 01:24:52.520
like what's with the

01:24:52.520 --> 01:24:54.520
the places where people go and they open

01:24:54.520 --> 01:24:56.520
their laptops and they just sit there and they write

01:24:56.520 --> 01:24:58.520
their screenplays

01:24:58.520 --> 01:25:00.520
like I

01:25:00.520 --> 01:25:02.520

01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:04.520
I don't think ghost cast a shadow

01:27:04.520 --> 01:27:06.520
ghost catcher

01:27:06.520 --> 01:27:08.520
ghost catcher

01:27:08.520 --> 01:27:10.520
the biggest monster

01:27:10.520 --> 01:27:12.520
lich

01:27:12.520 --> 01:27:14.520
what if there's like a boom operator but he gets like

01:27:14.520 --> 01:27:16.520
rust monster

01:27:16.520 --> 01:27:18.520
instead of being the invisible man

01:27:18.520 --> 01:27:20.520
anything he touches turns invisible

01:27:20.520 --> 01:27:22.520
so he becomes a boom operator because he can

01:27:22.520 --> 01:27:24.520
put that boom in any shot he wants to

01:27:24.520 --> 01:27:26.520
because that's good

01:27:26.520 --> 01:27:28.520
get the best audio in the world

01:27:28.520 --> 01:27:30.520
that could be an episode of rick and morty

01:27:30.520 --> 01:27:32.520
69 episodes

01:27:32.520 --> 01:27:34.520
I spent about

01:27:34.520 --> 01:27:36.520
four hours talking about invisibility technology

01:27:36.520 --> 01:27:38.520
today in the rick and morty writers room like we were

01:27:38.520 --> 01:27:40.520
we were picking apart like how invisibility

01:27:40.520 --> 01:27:42.520
tech would work and what it would require

01:27:42.520 --> 01:27:44.520
years ago I met a guy who is in the

01:27:44.520 --> 01:27:46.520
military and he said that like there is some

01:27:46.520 --> 01:27:48.520
military briefing where like

01:27:48.520 --> 01:27:50.520
some guy like was

01:27:50.520 --> 01:27:52.520
walking around wearing an invisibility suit

01:27:52.520 --> 01:27:54.520
and you could kind of see but like you mostly

01:27:54.520 --> 01:27:56.520
couldn't and so people didn't even notice

01:27:56.520 --> 01:27:58.520
he was in the room and they're like this is the new tech

01:27:58.520 --> 01:28:00.520
gentleman or whatever the fuck yeah

01:28:00.520 --> 01:28:02.520
my conclusion was like

01:28:02.520 --> 01:28:04.520
if you it's like

01:28:04.520 --> 01:28:06.520
forget about the it's funny how in the

01:28:06.520 --> 01:28:08.520
80s like we kind of went biological

01:28:08.520 --> 01:28:10.520
with it and that's where you got the trope

01:28:10.520 --> 01:28:12.520
of like oh you have to be naked

01:28:12.520 --> 01:28:14.520
like take otherwise you're just going to be like

01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:16.520
because it was like we went it's funny

01:28:16.520 --> 01:28:18.520
how like our consciousness of like sci-fi

01:28:18.520 --> 01:28:20.520
like proceeds along certain lines like in the

01:28:20.520 --> 01:28:22.520
80s we were like an invisible

01:28:22.520 --> 01:28:24.520
person would have to be would have to

01:28:24.520 --> 01:28:26.520
be like oh your skin is invisible

01:28:26.520 --> 01:28:28.520
and then like so that means

01:28:28.520 --> 01:28:30.520
you if you're wearing a sports bra it would

01:28:30.520 --> 01:28:32.520
just be a floating sports bra and then you take it off

01:28:32.520 --> 01:28:34.520
and then we would make these movies about

01:28:34.520 --> 01:28:36.520
like oh no I'm naked and I'm

01:28:36.520 --> 01:28:38.520
but we yeah it's now more like

01:28:38.520 --> 01:28:40.520
like I think yeah like

01:28:40.520 --> 01:28:42.520
we're talking today about like what okay

01:28:42.520 --> 01:28:44.520
what if Rick had an invisibility belt like

01:28:44.520 --> 01:28:46.520
what would it be a belt like he would

01:28:46.520 --> 01:28:48.520
have designed it to be like easy to

01:28:48.520 --> 01:28:50.520
just so it's like I was

01:28:50.520 --> 01:28:52.520
I was like it'd probably be like a

01:28:52.520 --> 01:28:54.520
it's like a cloud of you know

01:28:54.520 --> 01:28:56.520
it like scans the contiguous surfaces

01:28:56.520 --> 01:28:58.520
you know so

01:28:58.520 --> 01:29:00.520
if you're holding a coffee cup

01:29:00.520 --> 01:29:02.520
and you activate the bell

01:29:02.520 --> 01:29:04.520
like the coffee couple disappear because

01:29:04.520 --> 01:29:06.520
for the same reason your shirt does and your

01:29:06.520 --> 01:29:08.520
hair does and your fingernails and your

01:29:08.520 --> 01:29:10.520
everything because it's like

01:29:10.520 --> 01:29:12.520
it scans the

01:29:12.520 --> 01:29:14.520
surfaces like stuff. So the cuff doesn't

01:29:14.520 --> 01:29:16.520
have to wear a belt either? No

01:29:16.520 --> 01:29:18.520
the cup doesn't have to wear a belt

01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:20.520
but it could

01:29:20.520 --> 01:29:22.520
the cup I'm sure could wear a little belt

01:29:22.520 --> 01:29:24.520
if the cup

01:29:24.520 --> 01:29:26.520
wears a little belt and then Rick

01:29:26.520 --> 01:29:28.520
picks it up would he not need

01:29:28.520 --> 01:29:30.520
the belt anymore

01:29:30.520 --> 01:29:32.520
if it was the right

01:29:32.520 --> 01:29:34.520
alright well you actually I mean that's

01:29:34.520 --> 01:29:36.520
did I break the story? Well you didn't break

01:29:36.520 --> 01:29:38.520
68 episodes

01:29:38.520 --> 01:29:40.520
68 episodes I mean that's actually

01:29:40.520 --> 01:29:42.520
a pretty good point why not just put the belt around

01:29:42.520 --> 01:29:44.520
a coffee cup and hold the coffee

01:29:44.520 --> 01:29:46.520
you get a nice hot cup of coffee

01:29:46.520 --> 01:29:48.520
and you're invisible

01:29:48.520 --> 01:29:50.520
anytime you want to turn visible put the cup

01:29:50.520 --> 01:29:52.520
down

01:29:52.520 --> 01:29:54.520
alright I'm telling you

01:29:54.520 --> 01:29:56.520
I'm using it. Tant stay up

01:29:56.520 --> 01:29:58.520
it makes more sense than having like

01:29:58.520 --> 01:30:00.520
worry about a belt around yourself

01:30:00.520 --> 01:30:02.520
I don't know what the fucking problem

01:30:02.520 --> 01:30:04.520
is over there

01:30:06.520 --> 01:30:08.520
but it's kind of like you need like

01:30:08.520 --> 01:30:10.520
a cloud of

01:30:10.520 --> 01:30:12.520
like they kind of like

01:30:12.520 --> 01:30:14.520
mapped itself around your surfaces

01:30:14.520 --> 01:30:16.520
and like

01:30:16.520 --> 01:30:18.520
subatomic cameras

01:30:18.520 --> 01:30:20.520
and like photo receptors

01:30:20.520 --> 01:30:22.520
and projectors that

01:30:22.520 --> 01:30:24.520
like

01:30:24.520 --> 01:30:26.520
we're taking in information from all

01:30:26.520 --> 01:30:28.520
the light that hit it from every conceivable

01:30:28.520 --> 01:30:30.520
angle in real time and then simultaneously

01:30:30.520 --> 01:30:32.520
where it's like having a

01:30:32.520 --> 01:30:34.520
relationship with anything

01:30:34.520 --> 01:30:36.520
in any variation of like behind it

01:30:36.520 --> 01:30:38.520
and then I asked the question like

01:30:38.520 --> 01:30:40.520
well what if you back up against a wall

01:30:40.520 --> 01:30:42.520
wouldn't you then project a shadow

01:30:42.520 --> 01:30:44.520
under your surface but then I was like

01:30:44.520 --> 01:30:46.520
no I'm thinking macroscopically

01:30:46.520 --> 01:30:48.520
like if you if there's subatomic

01:30:48.520 --> 01:30:50.520
like nano cameras

01:30:50.520 --> 01:30:52.520
I don't know if there's I don't know if you can go subatomic

01:30:52.520 --> 01:30:54.520
with your nano but

01:30:54.520 --> 01:30:56.520
I mean hey what's nano

01:30:56.520 --> 01:30:58.520
if it's not subatomic

01:30:58.520 --> 01:31:00.520
but if it's like then it's like you could like

01:31:00.520 --> 01:31:02.520
push up against a wall and still to like

01:31:02.520 --> 01:31:04.520
something that's like the size of an electron

01:31:04.520 --> 01:31:06.520
or like somewhat bigger

01:31:06.520 --> 01:31:08.520
there'd still be a football field worth of distance

01:31:08.520 --> 01:31:10.520
between it and even a surface you're touching

01:31:10.520 --> 01:31:12.520
maybe yeah and I also think that

01:31:12.520 --> 01:31:14.520
it would want to map like the surface

01:31:14.520 --> 01:31:16.520
and then the light level that it was

01:31:16.520 --> 01:31:18.520
you know intercepting so

01:31:18.520 --> 01:31:20.520
because it's gonna like make these calculations

01:31:20.520 --> 01:31:22.520
like well there's a spotlight on the front of me

01:31:22.520 --> 01:31:24.520
right then I'm gonna take information

01:31:24.520 --> 01:31:26.520
from between this camera on the back

01:31:26.520 --> 01:31:28.520
and then I'm gonna like it's basically like the whole

01:31:28.520 --> 01:31:30.520
thing's job obviously it sounds kind of dumb

01:31:30.520 --> 01:31:32.520
to say it out loud but it's like the whole thing's job

01:31:32.520 --> 01:31:34.520
is just to airbrush you out of

01:31:34.520 --> 01:31:36.520
of it exists it's to take

01:31:36.520 --> 01:31:38.520
in all available data which I do believe

01:31:38.520 --> 01:31:40.520
is possible it's just a matter of processing

01:31:40.520 --> 01:31:42.520
and AI and stuff that you would be able

01:31:42.520 --> 01:31:44.520
to have a cloud

01:31:44.520 --> 01:31:46.520
of technology around

01:31:46.520 --> 01:31:48.520
you that was

01:31:48.520 --> 01:31:50.520
making calculations fast

01:31:50.520 --> 01:31:52.520
enough to simply adjust for what

01:31:52.520 --> 01:31:54.520
for all light

01:31:54.520 --> 01:31:56.520
coming at it and projecting

01:31:56.520 --> 01:31:58.520
light outward you'd need like a tremendous amount

01:31:58.520 --> 01:32:00.520
of power probably too because it's not going to be powered

01:32:00.520 --> 01:32:02.520
by the light it would be like a battery

01:32:02.520 --> 01:32:04.520
that would be running out because it would be like

01:32:04.520 --> 01:32:06.520
the world's most fancy lamp

01:32:06.520 --> 01:32:08.520
would be like sending out

01:32:08.520 --> 01:32:10.520
like a bazillion light waves

01:32:10.520 --> 01:32:12.520
out that were like being compensated for

01:32:12.520 --> 01:32:14.520
there's also like the version

01:32:14.520 --> 01:32:16.520
that it just it doesn't actually do that

01:32:16.520 --> 01:32:18.520
it just it just moves the light that

01:32:18.520 --> 01:32:20.520
would hit you to where it would

01:32:20.520 --> 01:32:22.520
go past you so it just

01:32:22.520 --> 01:32:24.520
bends the light around you and then

01:32:24.520 --> 01:32:26.520
puts it back at the right exact angle

01:32:26.520 --> 01:32:28.520
right after it clears

01:32:28.520 --> 01:32:30.520
your body so then it's the same beam

01:32:30.520 --> 01:32:32.520
of light that would go and hit you

01:32:32.520 --> 01:32:34.520
and reflect off showing a visual picture

01:32:34.520 --> 01:32:36.520
and that beam of light hits the

01:32:36.520 --> 01:32:38.520
hits the wall behind you and then vice-versa

01:32:38.520 --> 01:32:40.520
the back way yeah I do believe that

01:32:40.520 --> 01:32:42.520
there I'm certain that they got to be working

01:32:42.520 --> 01:32:44.520
on that yeah in the military

01:32:44.520 --> 01:32:46.520
I know that like the

01:32:46.520 --> 01:32:48.520
that that poor young lady that

01:32:48.520 --> 01:32:50.520
that wound up in the water tank

01:32:50.520 --> 01:32:52.520
at the Cecil hotel like that

01:32:52.520 --> 01:32:54.520
part of that myth you know the

01:32:54.520 --> 01:32:56.520
conspiracy theories about that is that

01:32:56.520 --> 01:32:58.520
she some there's some there's some like

01:32:58.520 --> 01:33:00.520
like two degrees of separation

01:33:00.520 --> 01:33:02.520
between her and like

01:33:02.520 --> 01:33:04.520
invisibility technology the

01:33:04.520 --> 01:33:06.520
red-handed podcast talk to the episode

01:33:06.520 --> 01:33:08.520
about her after they hurt their

01:33:08.520 --> 01:33:10.520
appearance here while they were in LA

01:33:10.520 --> 01:33:12.520
they and and it was

01:33:12.520 --> 01:33:14.520
it was like that the idea

01:33:14.520 --> 01:33:16.520
was that that's what she's in the elevator

01:33:16.520 --> 01:33:18.520
and she's like interacting with things that

01:33:18.520 --> 01:33:20.520
aren't there because she stumbled too close

01:33:20.520 --> 01:33:22.520
to cloaking tech

01:33:22.520 --> 01:33:24.520
I'm laughing because

01:33:24.520 --> 01:33:26.520
it's a terrible desecration

01:33:26.520 --> 01:33:28.520
of a human being's death to like have these

01:33:28.520 --> 01:33:30.520
weird Captain America theories about

01:33:30.520 --> 01:33:32.520
like I just imagine her parents going

01:33:32.520 --> 01:33:34.520
like I wonder what happened to her and

01:33:34.520 --> 01:33:36.520
well I've got a theory I think that G.I.

01:33:36.520 --> 01:33:38.520
Joe did it and they're like

01:33:38.520 --> 01:33:40.520
thanks but

01:33:40.520 --> 01:33:42.520
still kind of because there is

01:33:42.520 --> 01:33:44.520
a scene in the elevator in Captain

01:33:44.520 --> 01:33:46.520
America oh god right where

01:33:46.520 --> 01:33:48.520
he's invisible I'm like

01:33:48.520 --> 01:33:50.520
was he in visit yeah and that scene

01:33:50.520 --> 01:33:52.520
have you seen the security camera

01:33:52.520 --> 01:33:54.520
footage of the of the elite

01:33:54.520 --> 01:33:56.520
Aliza lamb

01:33:56.520 --> 01:33:58.520
that disappeared from the hotel

01:33:58.520 --> 01:34:00.520
and then ended up in the

01:34:00.520 --> 01:34:02.520
have you seen that you're familiar with that

01:34:02.520 --> 01:34:04.520
I haven't watched it recently

01:34:04.520 --> 01:34:06.520
that's fair

01:34:06.520 --> 01:34:08.520
has cold case murder mysteries weighed in

01:34:10.520 --> 01:34:12.520
yes what did he say

01:34:14.520 --> 01:34:16.520
she

01:34:16.520 --> 01:34:18.520
that she

01:34:18.520 --> 01:34:20.520
was off her meds and that

01:34:20.520 --> 01:34:22.520
she may have even

01:34:22.520 --> 01:34:24.520
found some stuff

01:34:24.520 --> 01:34:26.520
like maybe took some e or something

01:34:26.520 --> 01:34:28.520
but like in any case was off

01:34:28.520 --> 01:34:30.520
her meds and was experiencing

01:34:30.520 --> 01:34:32.520
and she that she was

01:34:32.520 --> 01:34:34.520
in a suicidal state and like

01:34:34.520 --> 01:34:36.520
kind of found her way

01:34:36.520 --> 01:34:38.520
up to the highest point

01:34:38.520 --> 01:34:40.520
and and just kind of

01:34:40.520 --> 01:34:42.520
went with it you know but she was just

01:34:42.520 --> 01:34:44.520
on a trip and kind of

01:34:44.520 --> 01:34:46.520
found this like ladder

01:34:46.520 --> 01:34:48.520
going up to this thing and went into this

01:34:48.520 --> 01:34:50.520
thing and there was water and it was nice

01:34:50.520 --> 01:34:52.520
and she just kind of

01:34:52.520 --> 01:34:54.520
had an accident

01:34:54.520 --> 01:34:56.520
I like that I like

01:34:56.520 --> 01:34:58.520
Asperger detective does it again

01:34:58.520 --> 01:35:00.520
it's usually not

01:35:00.520 --> 01:35:02.520
as simple as usually more simple

01:35:02.520 --> 01:35:04.520
than it seems he's going to come on the show now

01:35:04.520 --> 01:35:06.520
yeah he's coming I think May 20th

01:35:06.520 --> 01:35:08.520
or something which is actual name so we don't have to

01:35:08.520 --> 01:35:10.520
call it asperger detective

01:35:10.520 --> 01:35:12.520
Ryan Kraus it's Ryan Kraus

01:35:12.520 --> 01:35:14.520
we have confirmation that he doesn't

01:35:14.520 --> 01:35:16.520
mind being called that but I think

01:35:16.520 --> 01:35:18.520
maybe other people mind him being called

01:35:18.520 --> 01:35:20.520
that so yeah we'll start

01:35:20.520 --> 01:35:22.520
calling him

01:35:22.520 --> 01:35:24.520
Dan I told you I ran into Open Mike Eagle the other day

01:35:24.520 --> 01:35:26.520
and he

01:35:26.520 --> 01:35:28.520
your tape that you guys made of you rapping

01:35:28.520 --> 01:35:30.520
that's going to drop soon so he

01:35:30.520 --> 01:35:32.520
wants to come back on the show

01:35:32.520 --> 01:35:34.520
yeah it's going to drop soon

01:35:34.520 --> 01:35:36.520
I think there's references

01:35:36.520 --> 01:35:38.520
I'm like

01:35:38.520 --> 01:35:40.520
rapping on that now I'm going

01:35:40.520 --> 01:35:42.520
I'm 44 years old and it's

01:35:42.520 --> 01:35:44.520
2014

01:35:44.520 --> 01:35:46.520

01:35:46.520 --> 01:35:48.520

01:35:48.520 --> 01:35:50.520
he said yeah he goes

01:35:50.520 --> 01:35:52.520
Dan went into a pretty dark

01:35:52.520 --> 01:35:54.520
place yeah we talked about that on here

01:35:54.520 --> 01:35:56.520

01:35:56.520 --> 01:35:58.520
conical shaped joint

01:35:58.520 --> 01:36:00.520
like that looked like a sushi hand roll

01:36:00.520 --> 01:36:02.520
and like

01:36:02.520 --> 01:36:04.520
the only thing I remember

01:36:04.520 --> 01:36:06.520
is crying

01:36:06.520 --> 01:36:08.520
and Mike

01:36:08.520 --> 01:36:10.520
doing things like

01:36:10.520 --> 01:36:12.520
behind the other glass and going like

01:36:12.520 --> 01:36:14.520

01:36:14.520 --> 01:36:16.520

01:36:16.520 --> 01:36:18.520
I don't know

01:36:26.520 --> 01:36:28.520

01:36:30.520 --> 01:36:32.520
so I'm not looking forward to that track

01:36:32.520 --> 01:36:34.520
because I'm sure the reason isn't

01:36:34.520 --> 01:36:36.520
awesome

01:36:36.520 --> 01:36:38.520
I gotta hear this

01:36:40.520 --> 01:36:42.520

01:36:44.520 --> 01:36:46.520

01:37:08.520 --> 01:37:10.520
New York over London over Dubai

01:37:10.520 --> 01:37:12.520

01:37:14.520 --> 01:37:16.520
what's by far the worst one

01:37:16.520 --> 01:37:18.520
you don't have to answer

01:37:18.520 --> 01:37:20.520
yeah I don't know

01:37:20.520 --> 01:37:22.520
Milwaukee I would imagine

01:37:22.520 --> 01:37:24.520
I overheard Milwaukee

01:37:24.520 --> 01:37:26.520
Milwaukee would be challenging

01:37:26.520 --> 01:37:28.520
did I ever tell you the overheard thing I heard

01:37:28.520 --> 01:37:30.520

it was a great and lovely theater

01:38:12.520 --> 01:38:14.520
and we went across the street to this pub

01:38:14.520 --> 01:38:16.520
and restaurant which is probably the theater

01:38:16.520 --> 01:38:18.520
and the people that were our servers were lovely

01:38:18.520 --> 01:38:20.520
and they were very nice and very polite

01:38:20.520 --> 01:38:22.520
and they had their little uniforms on

01:38:22.520 --> 01:38:24.520
and then they said hey this restaurant's closing

01:38:24.520 --> 01:38:26.520

01:38:26.520 --> 01:38:28.520

01:38:28.520 --> 01:38:30.520
and

01:38:30.520 --> 01:38:32.520

01:38:40.520 --> 01:38:42.520
and

01:38:42.520 --> 01:38:44.520
people were doing the electric slide to Ice Ice Baby

01:38:44.520 --> 01:38:46.520

01:38:46.520 --> 01:38:48.520
and it was really good

01:38:48.520 --> 01:38:50.520
and Ryan Stiles was there and this girl

01:38:50.520 --> 01:38:52.520
was coming on to him

01:38:52.520 --> 01:38:54.520
she's a very attractive younger gal

01:38:54.520 --> 01:38:56.520
way more than half his age

01:38:56.520 --> 01:38:58.520
way less than half his age

01:38:58.520 --> 01:39:00.520
and

01:39:00.520 --> 01:39:02.520
we're all leaving and we're going to this other bar

01:39:02.520 --> 01:39:04.520

01:39:16.520 --> 01:39:18.520
hanging on him and propositioning him basically

01:39:18.520 --> 01:39:20.520

01:39:20.520 --> 01:39:22.520

01:40:00.520 --> 01:40:02.520
heard a quiet place

01:40:04.520 --> 01:40:06.520
a quiet place

01:40:08.520 --> 01:40:10.520
because if they talk they get

01:40:10.520 --> 01:40:12.520
ate by monsters

01:40:12.520 --> 01:40:14.520

but but but but

01:40:16.520 --> 01:40:18.520
the person that's overhearing it it could be

01:40:18.520 --> 01:40:20.520
quietly typing into the Instagram account going

01:40:20.520 --> 01:40:22.520

01:40:22.520 --> 01:40:24.520

or if the account is just owned

01:40:26.520 --> 01:40:28.520
by the things that are eating people there

01:40:28.520 --> 01:40:30.520

01:40:30.520 --> 01:40:32.520

hard door over her over her baby

01:40:38.520 --> 01:40:40.520
baby spitting

01:40:40.520 --> 01:40:42.520
over her sound

01:40:42.520 --> 01:40:44.520
of a foam padded

01:40:44.520 --> 01:40:46.520
booby hatch in lean

01:40:46.520 --> 01:40:48.520

01:41:04.520 --> 01:41:06.520
Dan Harmon it's you up on

01:41:06.520 --> 01:41:08.520
January 19th

2018 a very dark day this is this

01:41:10.520 --> 01:41:12.520
is Leslie Irfins and Nicole Delaney

01:41:12.520 --> 01:41:14.520
while we're working on a script I could

01:41:14.520 --> 01:41:16.520
hook you up with nerds but it's not like

01:41:16.520 --> 01:41:18.520
Rushmore okay they're losers

01:41:20.520 --> 01:41:22.520
there that's it so I thought

01:41:22.520 --> 01:41:24.520
that was four likes

01:41:24.520 --> 01:41:26.520
four likes wait

01:41:26.520 --> 01:41:28.520

01:41:28.520 --> 01:41:30.520
damn

01:41:30.520 --> 01:41:32.520
but the uh I mean

01:41:32.520 --> 01:41:34.520
great movie great soundtrack

01:41:34.520 --> 01:41:36.520
yeah for sure what it's worth

01:41:36.520 --> 01:41:38.520
no I thought she was

01:41:38.520 --> 01:41:40.520
she really resonated

01:41:40.520 --> 01:41:42.520
because Nicole's a lot younger it's just like

01:41:42.520 --> 01:41:44.520
it's like no you don't understand nerds

01:41:44.520 --> 01:41:46.520
not nerds like billionaires

01:41:46.520 --> 01:41:48.520
well she meant like geeks

01:41:48.520 --> 01:41:50.520
like Avengers she meant geeks right

01:41:50.520 --> 01:41:52.520
look I have semantics

01:41:52.520 --> 01:41:54.520
I don't know I mean look

01:41:54.520 --> 01:41:56.520
isn't there a big gap between geeks

01:41:56.520 --> 01:41:58.520
and nerds well there used to be

01:41:58.520 --> 01:42:00.520
a geek has a big

01:42:00.520 --> 01:42:02.520
geek is kind of in like

01:42:02.520 --> 01:42:04.520
there used to be a lot of talk about this

01:42:04.520 --> 01:42:06.520
which is like nerds are

01:42:06.520 --> 01:42:08.520
nerds can look like anything

01:42:08.520 --> 01:42:10.520
but like uh

01:42:10.520 --> 01:42:12.520
it's about their fascination with specific

01:42:12.520 --> 01:42:14.520
topics that makes them socially

01:42:14.520 --> 01:42:16.520
unrelatable and then like

01:42:16.520 --> 01:42:18.520
geeks are like more like

01:42:18.520 --> 01:42:20.520
their IQ can can be

01:42:20.520 --> 01:42:22.520
in any range but there physically

01:42:22.520 --> 01:42:24.520
there's something wrong

01:42:24.520 --> 01:42:26.520
or is there like they have like bad

01:42:26.520 --> 01:42:28.520
mannerisms or whatever like they have

01:42:28.520 --> 01:42:30.520
a lizard for a pet or something

01:42:30.520 --> 01:42:32.520
um yeah

01:42:32.520 --> 01:42:34.520
which which makes sense because like geek like

01:42:34.520 --> 01:42:36.520
I think it's what's a dork then

01:42:36.520 --> 01:42:38.520
I do I do yeah a dork

01:42:38.520 --> 01:42:40.520
dork's probably

01:42:40.520 --> 01:42:42.520
like just a young nerd

01:42:42.520 --> 01:42:44.520
like a puppy nerd

01:42:44.520 --> 01:42:46.520
yeah but I would just use them interchangeably

01:42:46.520 --> 01:42:48.520
I don't know why I'm I mean now

01:42:48.520 --> 01:42:50.520
like like what you're adored I just feel like there was

01:42:50.520 --> 01:42:52.520
a vice article about this in 2013

01:42:52.520 --> 01:42:54.520
that we would yeah

01:42:54.520 --> 01:42:56.520
yeah millhouse says like geeks

01:42:56.520 --> 01:42:58.520
are or nerds are good at something

01:42:58.520 --> 01:43:00.520
we're like me geeks are just

01:43:00.520 --> 01:43:02.520
nerds

01:43:02.520 --> 01:43:04.520
when I was growing up they said a dork

01:43:04.520 --> 01:43:06.520
was a whales penis you guys

01:43:06.520 --> 01:43:08.520
hear about that a dork a dork

01:43:08.520 --> 01:43:10.520
a dork be like oh you're a dork and then

01:43:10.520 --> 01:43:12.520
they go ha ha that means whales penis

01:43:12.520 --> 01:43:14.520
and I never looked at I thought it was a donkey penis

01:43:14.520 --> 01:43:16.520
I heard it was just

01:43:16.520 --> 01:43:18.520
any penis

01:43:18.520 --> 01:43:20.520
I didn't hear like specifically like

01:43:20.520 --> 01:43:22.520
if it was a whale penis

01:43:22.520 --> 01:43:24.520
right or a donkey penis

01:43:24.520 --> 01:43:26.520
it was just just just

01:43:26.520 --> 01:43:28.520
a penis is what I

01:43:28.520 --> 01:43:30.520
thought like if you call somebody

01:43:30.520 --> 01:43:32.520
a dork you're basically

01:43:32.520 --> 01:43:34.520
calling them a penis again

01:43:34.520 --> 01:43:36.520
is what I thought they rated our animated

01:43:36.520 --> 01:43:38.520
film heavy metal the guy

01:43:38.520 --> 01:43:40.520
refers to his dork

01:43:40.520 --> 01:43:42.520
right maybe that's what the spawn

01:43:42.520 --> 01:43:44.520
is you know people don't say anymore

01:43:44.520 --> 01:43:46.520
for fucking is pork

01:43:46.520 --> 01:43:48.520
oh yeah

01:43:48.520 --> 01:43:50.520
European vacation

01:43:50.520 --> 01:43:52.520
yes rusty he may

01:43:52.520 --> 01:43:54.520
porker

01:43:54.520 --> 01:43:56.520
that's for me is the funniest one

01:43:56.520 --> 01:43:58.520
I mean that was the defining line of my childhood

01:43:58.520 --> 01:44:00.520
yes rusty he may porker

01:44:00.520 --> 01:44:02.520
new language that I'm not a fan of

01:44:02.520 --> 01:44:04.520
cum gutters don't like

01:44:04.520 --> 01:44:06.520
don't want to hear about your

01:44:06.520 --> 01:44:08.520
cum gutters what what what

01:44:08.520 --> 01:44:10.520
so reference to these like

01:44:10.520 --> 01:44:12.520
muscles down here like kind of like

01:44:12.520 --> 01:44:14.520
if you're fucking ripped because we've gone

01:44:14.520 --> 01:44:16.520
beyond six packs that's not enough it's like

01:44:16.520 --> 01:44:18.520
cum gutters are like the kind of angular like

01:44:18.520 --> 01:44:20.520
you know muscles it's like

01:44:20.520 --> 01:44:22.520
like look at those cum where's the cum

01:44:22.520 --> 01:44:24.520
coming from and like what direction that's

01:44:24.520 --> 01:44:26.520
the thing that I hate what I hate about

01:44:26.520 --> 01:44:28.520
that phrase is that it makes you picture watery

01:44:28.520 --> 01:44:30.520
cum

01:44:30.520 --> 01:44:32.520
like old cum

01:44:32.520 --> 01:44:34.520
just flowing

01:44:34.520 --> 01:44:36.520
down but by the time

01:44:36.520 --> 01:44:38.520
cum needs a gutter it's gross

01:44:38.520 --> 01:44:40.520
cum doesn't by the way

01:44:40.520 --> 01:44:42.520
served pipe and hot it's not

01:44:42.520 --> 01:44:44.520
fucking

01:44:44.520 --> 01:44:46.520
it's not glamorous

01:44:46.520 --> 01:44:48.520
but at least it's indicative

01:44:48.520 --> 01:44:50.520
of a fucking moment

01:44:50.520 --> 01:44:52.520
the idea of it needing a

01:44:52.520 --> 01:44:54.520
gutter means it's like been laying

01:44:54.520 --> 01:44:56.520
somewhere for five to ten minutes

01:44:56.520 --> 01:44:58.520
and it's like oh okay like yeah

01:44:58.520 --> 01:45:00.520
who's is it your own so you jerk off

01:45:00.520 --> 01:45:02.520
laying on your back like a freak

01:45:02.520 --> 01:45:04.520
yeah but oh

01:45:04.520 --> 01:45:06.520
I'm a dealer I'm a dealer

01:45:06.520 --> 01:45:08.520
hey hey hey hey

01:45:08.520 --> 01:45:10.520
and then I guess it's just like it just

01:45:10.520 --> 01:45:12.520
makes me picture Brad Pitt in the 90s

01:45:12.520 --> 01:45:14.520
and it's just like with cum all over him

01:45:14.520 --> 01:45:16.520
and like dripping symmetrically

01:45:16.520 --> 01:45:18.520
down each side of his

01:45:18.520 --> 01:45:20.520
like I don't want to picture that

01:45:20.520 --> 01:45:22.520
I wasn't thinking that at all

01:45:22.520 --> 01:45:24.520
what

01:45:24.520 --> 01:45:26.520
cum gutters

01:45:26.520 --> 01:45:28.520
because they go to your

01:45:28.520 --> 01:45:30.520
side so there's just people coming

01:45:30.520 --> 01:45:32.520
on your hips

01:45:32.520 --> 01:45:34.520
I think it's your own cum

01:45:34.520 --> 01:45:36.520
I think it's based on the idea of like

01:45:36.520 --> 01:45:38.520
looking off and like he comes on his own

01:45:38.520 --> 01:45:40.520
torso and then it's like

01:45:40.520 --> 01:45:42.520
these are disgusting people

01:45:42.520 --> 01:45:44.520
coming up with these phrases

01:45:44.520 --> 01:45:46.520
they're trying to think of the grossest way

01:45:46.520 --> 01:45:48.520
to describe something and they're succeeding

01:45:48.520 --> 01:45:50.520
something beautiful

01:45:50.520 --> 01:45:52.520
and they gotta fuck it up with their gross language

01:45:52.520 --> 01:45:54.520
something beautiful Jesus has them

01:45:54.520 --> 01:45:56.520
like it's a good fucking like

01:45:56.520 --> 01:45:58.520
he's got sweet cum gutters

01:45:58.520 --> 01:46:00.520
Jesus

01:46:00.520 --> 01:46:02.520
Jesus has sweet cum gutters

01:46:02.520 --> 01:46:04.520
there's our title

01:46:04.520 --> 01:46:06.520
episode

01:46:06.520 --> 01:46:08.520
Brad Pitt has to like eat something

01:46:08.520 --> 01:46:10.520
every time he jacks off

01:46:14.520 --> 01:46:16.520
I'll take another sandwich

01:46:18.520 --> 01:46:20.520
you know what a fucking terrible summer job is

01:46:20.520 --> 01:46:22.520
the poor kid that's gotta go clean up

01:46:22.520 --> 01:46:24.520
Brad Pitt's cum gutters

01:46:24.520 --> 01:46:26.520
I'm here to clean your cum gutters

01:46:28.520 --> 01:46:30.520
that's my Brad Pitt impression

01:46:30.520 --> 01:46:32.520
I only

01:46:32.520 --> 01:46:34.520
can do an impression of Brad Pitt from 12 Monkeys

01:46:42.520 --> 01:46:44.520
that's right after that movie is when he started eating

01:46:44.520 --> 01:46:46.520
in everything

01:46:50.520 --> 01:46:52.520
every movie after that he always has like a bag

01:46:52.520 --> 01:46:54.520
of sunflower seeds or potato chips or something

01:46:54.520 --> 01:46:56.520
he took a class or something it was like

01:46:56.520 --> 01:46:58.520
you should eat something

01:46:58.520 --> 01:47:00.520
I'm not I'm not disagreeing

01:47:00.520 --> 01:47:02.520
I think it's interesting

01:47:02.520 --> 01:47:04.520
he's like checking out those hot cum gutters

01:47:04.520 --> 01:47:06.520
he's like here's some potato chips

01:47:06.520 --> 01:47:08.520
it looks like your cum gutters aren't gonna last forever

01:47:08.520 --> 01:47:10.520
but your choices are

01:47:14.520 --> 01:47:16.520
cum gutters

01:47:16.520 --> 01:47:18.520
give your character some business

01:47:18.520 --> 01:47:20.520
not everyone has cum gutters

01:47:20.520 --> 01:47:30.520
you're not gonna be 27 forever Brad

01:47:30.520 --> 01:47:32.520
I've seen 12 monkeys

01:47:32.520 --> 01:47:34.520
and I don't know what the fuck you're doing

01:47:38.520 --> 01:47:40.520
I don't know what he's doing

01:47:40.520 --> 01:47:42.520
he keeps looking at us too

01:47:44.520 --> 01:47:46.520
I'm hoping some erstwhile

01:47:46.520 --> 01:47:48.520
I learned the meaning of the word erstwhile recently

01:47:48.520 --> 01:47:50.520
it's not earnest

01:47:50.520 --> 01:47:52.520
I'm hoping some earnest

01:47:52.520 --> 01:47:54.520
Harmontown fan that has a subscription

01:47:54.520 --> 01:47:56.520
will split screen me

01:47:56.520 --> 01:47:58.520
doing my Brad Pitt impression

01:47:58.520 --> 01:48:00.520
with the clip from 12 Monkeys

01:48:00.520 --> 01:48:02.520
and fucking

01:48:02.520 --> 01:48:04.520
vindicate me

01:48:08.520 --> 01:48:10.520
cause you

01:48:10.520 --> 01:48:12.520
you need all 12 Monkeys

01:48:14.520 --> 01:48:16.520
we'll fucking rent it

01:48:16.520 --> 01:48:18.520
it's a pretty fun movie

01:48:18.520 --> 01:48:20.520
this is what overhead cum sounds like

01:48:20.520 --> 01:48:22.520
yeah overhead cum

01:48:22.520 --> 01:48:24.520
that's right overhead cum

01:48:26.520 --> 01:48:28.520
alright well that's gotta be about a whole podcast right

01:48:28.520 --> 01:48:30.520
we're close yeah

01:48:30.520 --> 01:48:32.520
overhead while having sex is maybe something

01:48:32.520 --> 01:48:34.520
that could be something

01:48:34.520 --> 01:48:36.520
do you think millennials

01:48:36.520 --> 01:48:38.520
are allowed to have problematic sex

01:48:38.520 --> 01:48:40.520
I don't know what the word problematic means

01:48:40.520 --> 01:48:42.520
well I mean like I think

01:48:42.520 --> 01:48:44.520
prone to problems

01:48:44.520 --> 01:48:46.520
mixed race millennial couple

01:48:48.520 --> 01:48:50.520
if a millennial couple

01:48:50.520 --> 01:48:52.520
is crossing like

01:48:52.520 --> 01:48:54.520
you have like two different

01:48:54.520 --> 01:48:56.520
ethnic backgrounds represented

01:48:56.520 --> 01:48:58.520
in your millennial couple

01:48:58.520 --> 01:49:00.520
when they're in bed together

01:49:00.520 --> 01:49:02.520
do they go to a place

01:49:02.520 --> 01:49:04.520
that would get one of them fired if they tweeted

01:49:06.520 --> 01:49:08.520
I would hope so too

01:49:08.520 --> 01:49:10.520
but they don't have to

01:49:10.520 --> 01:49:12.520
if that's not where their heart

01:49:12.520 --> 01:49:14.520
where their loins are going

01:49:14.520 --> 01:49:16.520
but I fear

01:49:16.520 --> 01:49:18.520
I read these articles probably in vice

01:49:18.520 --> 01:49:20.520
about how millennials are having less sex

01:49:20.520 --> 01:49:22.520
I think it's refinery 29 you're reading

01:49:22.520 --> 01:49:24.520
but yeah

01:49:24.520 --> 01:49:26.520
I think it is because they're terrified

01:49:26.520 --> 01:49:28.520
because it actually is I don't blame them

01:49:28.520 --> 01:49:30.520
they're seeing all the

01:49:30.520 --> 01:49:32.520
why on God's earth would I exchange

01:49:32.520 --> 01:49:34.520
bodily fluids with another human being

01:49:34.520 --> 01:49:36.520
that could end up ruining my life

01:49:36.520 --> 01:49:38.520
I don't know if that's it

01:49:38.520 --> 01:49:40.520
I started having sex in the sort of

01:49:40.520 --> 01:49:42.520
90s when

01:49:42.520 --> 01:49:44.520
nobody I mean I guess

01:49:44.520 --> 01:49:46.520
that's when VR started happening

01:49:46.520 --> 01:49:48.520
yeah but like AIDS too

01:49:48.520 --> 01:49:50.520
you know I remember being at college

01:49:50.520 --> 01:49:52.520
I mean we've talked about this many times

01:49:52.520 --> 01:49:54.520
at UC Santa Barbara

01:49:54.520 --> 01:49:56.520
and I had like

01:49:56.520 --> 01:49:58.520
three summer or four summer

01:49:58.520 --> 01:50:00.520
so I never had anything like that and hadn't since

01:50:00.520 --> 01:50:02.520
but I was an erotic Jew

01:50:02.520 --> 01:50:04.520
and I was just terrified and I drove home

01:50:04.520 --> 01:50:06.520
to LA and sat my parents down

01:50:06.520 --> 01:50:08.520
and was like I think I just got AIDS

01:50:08.520 --> 01:50:10.520
so

01:50:10.520 --> 01:50:12.520
that was scary I was scared of sex because of that

01:50:16.520 --> 01:50:18.520
I don't think people now are as scared

01:50:18.520 --> 01:50:20.520
of it for those reasons I think they're

01:50:20.520 --> 01:50:22.520
getting stimulation from a lot of places

01:50:22.520 --> 01:50:24.520
I wonder if a role play though in bed

01:50:24.520 --> 01:50:26.520
is what I'm saying because a lot of sexual

01:50:26.520 --> 01:50:28.520
role play is going to go to whatever the definition

01:50:28.520 --> 01:50:30.520
of taboo is and the good news

01:50:30.520 --> 01:50:32.520
would be that

01:50:32.520 --> 01:50:34.520
the definition of taboo is now

01:50:34.520 --> 01:50:36.520
more readily available than ever

01:50:36.520 --> 01:50:38.520
because I

01:50:38.520 --> 01:50:40.520
personally believe that the human

01:50:40.520 --> 01:50:42.520
sexual

01:50:42.520 --> 01:50:44.520
kind of organ that is the brain

01:50:44.520 --> 01:50:46.520
it only really needs a boundary

01:50:46.520 --> 01:50:48.520
to cross in order to get it

01:50:48.520 --> 01:50:50.520
it's like if there is

01:50:50.520 --> 01:50:52.520
a place to go that you're not supposed

01:50:52.520 --> 01:50:54.520
to go the human brain

01:50:54.520 --> 01:50:56.520
in a sexual

01:50:56.520 --> 01:50:58.520
like

01:50:58.520 --> 01:51:00.520
mode it's going to want to

01:51:00.520 --> 01:51:02.520
head toward those dark

01:51:02.520 --> 01:51:04.520
corners of the room and explore

01:51:04.520 --> 01:51:06.520
boundaries and things

01:51:06.520 --> 01:51:08.520
and

01:51:08.520 --> 01:51:10.520
I find myself wondering

01:51:10.520 --> 01:51:12.520
like

01:51:12.520 --> 01:51:14.520
does today's 25 year old

01:51:14.520 --> 01:51:16.520
when they do their

01:51:16.520 --> 01:51:18.520
hologram dating or whatever they do they swipe

01:51:18.520 --> 01:51:20.520
left and they swipe diagonally and then

01:51:20.520 --> 01:51:22.520
they end up in a relationship where they're

01:51:22.520 --> 01:51:24.520
having sex like do they when they're

01:51:24.520 --> 01:51:26.520
actually having sex do they then

01:51:26.520 --> 01:51:28.520
do they then go a little animalistic

01:51:28.520 --> 01:51:30.520
you know

01:51:30.520 --> 01:51:32.520
do they conjure situations

01:51:32.520 --> 01:51:34.520
anybody out there by applause

01:51:36.520 --> 01:51:38.520
I mean do they

01:51:38.520 --> 01:51:40.520
stand up

01:51:40.520 --> 01:51:42.520
like is it possible to have

01:51:42.520 --> 01:51:44.520
that compartmentalization

01:51:44.520 --> 01:51:46.520
where you're like look I'm an activist

01:51:46.520 --> 01:51:48.520
I believe in like all of these

01:51:48.520 --> 01:51:50.520
rights

01:51:50.520 --> 01:51:52.520
and things and these microaggressions

01:51:52.520 --> 01:51:54.520
and oppressions and things and we have to be

01:51:54.520 --> 01:51:56.520
watchful and aware of all these little ways

01:51:56.520 --> 01:51:58.520
that we're hurting each other but then with a

01:51:58.520 --> 01:52:00.520
partner to like throw it

01:52:00.520 --> 01:52:02.520
all away

01:52:02.520 --> 01:52:04.520
for the sake of like these genuine

01:52:04.520 --> 01:52:06.520
ruts where you're like

01:52:06.520 --> 01:52:08.520
let's be sea lions

01:52:08.520 --> 01:52:10.520
and just

01:52:10.520 --> 01:52:12.520
you know here's who

01:52:12.520 --> 01:52:14.520
here's what we're doing

01:52:14.520 --> 01:52:16.520
I wonder about that

01:52:16.520 --> 01:52:18.520
let's be sea lions

01:52:18.520 --> 01:52:20.520
I can't even

01:52:20.520 --> 01:52:22.520
riff like examples because I feel like

01:52:22.520 --> 01:52:24.520
that's the public world that we're living

01:52:24.520 --> 01:52:26.520
today and that's why I wonder

01:52:26.520 --> 01:52:28.520
a good thing about that

01:52:28.520 --> 01:52:30.520
if you told me yeah but in the bedroom

01:52:30.520 --> 01:52:32.520
they're going nuts

01:52:32.520 --> 01:52:34.520
like I would do

01:52:34.520 --> 01:52:36.520
for these kids great I'm glad for them

01:52:36.520 --> 01:52:38.520
I mean I don't know

01:52:38.520 --> 01:52:40.520
obviously but

01:52:40.520 --> 01:52:42.520
I think that it's more that

01:52:42.520 --> 01:52:44.520
you know

01:52:44.520 --> 01:52:46.520
I saw an article recently where it was like

01:52:46.520 --> 01:52:48.520
80% of all tweets come from

01:52:48.520 --> 01:52:50.520
2% of people

01:52:50.520 --> 01:52:52.520
wow Bernie Sanders

01:52:52.520 --> 01:52:54.520
is going to go crazy about that

01:52:54.520 --> 01:52:56.520
the billionaire class

01:52:56.520 --> 01:52:58.520
80% of the billionaire class

01:52:58.520 --> 01:53:00.520
billionaire class

01:53:00.520 --> 01:53:02.520
but

01:53:02.520 --> 01:53:04.520
yeah so I think a lot of this stuff is

01:53:04.520 --> 01:53:06.520
exaggerated I think there's this you know fear of the public

01:53:06.520 --> 01:53:08.520
square and the flogging and all that

01:53:08.520 --> 01:53:10.520
but people are actually quite normal

01:53:10.520 --> 01:53:12.520
but people are getting fired

01:53:12.520 --> 01:53:14.520
they are but I think they're having sex

01:53:14.520 --> 01:53:16.520
I think people are more stimulated by

01:53:16.520 --> 01:53:18.520
video games or instagram

01:53:18.520 --> 01:53:20.520
and that kind of feedback

01:53:20.520 --> 01:53:22.520
or social currency excuse me for a second

01:53:22.520 --> 01:53:24.520
what the fuck is going on over here

01:53:24.520 --> 01:53:26.520
can I get you something

01:53:26.520 --> 01:53:28.520
I wasn't on mic I didn't do anything

01:53:28.520 --> 01:53:30.520
I'm not bothering you

01:53:30.520 --> 01:53:32.520
why do you gotta go get up all in my biz

01:53:32.520 --> 01:53:34.520

01:53:34.520 --> 01:53:36.520
I'm not bothering you

01:53:36.520 --> 01:53:38.520
I'm not bothering you

01:53:38.520 --> 01:53:40.520
what was he saying to you

01:53:40.520 --> 01:53:42.520

01:53:42.520 --> 01:53:44.520
somebody had left and he was

01:53:44.520 --> 01:53:46.520
I was going what the fuck is going on

01:53:46.520 --> 01:53:48.520
oh right

01:53:48.520 --> 01:53:50.520

01:53:50.520 --> 01:53:52.520
yeah well it's weird how shit rolls uphill

01:53:52.520 --> 01:53:54.520
downhill

01:53:54.520 --> 01:53:56.520
that's weird yeah

in the show is like a kind of the mickey mouse club

01:54:20.520 --> 01:54:22.520
kind of thing where it's like

01:54:22.520 --> 01:54:24.520
