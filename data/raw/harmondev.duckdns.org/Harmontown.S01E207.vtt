{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:12.720\nFrom the Hyatt Regency Hotel and beautiful Montreal Kebbeck,\n\n00:12.720 --> 00:15.560\nHarmontown is now in session.\n\n00:15.560 --> 00:21.560\nLet's bring out Spencer Triton and everybody.\n\n00:21.560 --> 00:24.160\nYou know him.\n\n00:24.160 --> 00:25.840\nYou love him.\n\n00:25.840 --> 00:33.360\nYou want a piece of him, Spencer.\n\n00:33.360 --> 00:34.360\nHow you doing, brother?\n\n00:34.360 --> 00:35.360\nI'm so good.\n\n00:35.360 --> 00:38.880\nHow was that chicken sandwich with the McDonald's sitting with you?\n\n00:38.880 --> 00:41.720\nIt was not so good.\n\n00:41.720 --> 00:52.720\nLet's bring out the mayor, Harmontown, Dan Harmon.\n\n00:52.720 --> 00:53.720\nBonjour.\n\n00:53.720 --> 01:08.720\nWe're going to do the whole show in French.\n\n01:08.720 --> 01:09.720\nDan, almost.\n\n01:09.720 --> 01:10.720\nThere we are.\n\n01:10.720 --> 01:11.720\nThe German Pell, and I'm out.\n\n01:11.720 --> 01:12.720\nThat's it.\n\n01:12.720 --> 01:13.720\nThat's all I got.\n\n01:13.720 --> 01:17.720\nThat's two years of French in my high school days.\n\n01:17.720 --> 01:23.200\nThey make you take French, but you can also take Spanish, and you take each one for a year\n\n01:23.200 --> 01:31.080\nand you just kind of, I don't know, if eight here is wheat or ocho, you know, if being\n\n01:31.080 --> 01:37.360\nbilingual makes you so great, then how come everyone bilingual isn't rich, you know?\n\n01:37.360 --> 01:41.040\nLike you why don't you have twice as much money if it's so important?\n\n01:41.040 --> 01:44.320\nI guess Americans can't really have that philosophy anymore.\n\n01:44.320 --> 01:46.320\nWe're kind of broke now.\n\n01:46.320 --> 01:50.320\nThe joke, if you speak three languages, you try a language, if you speak two languages,\n\n01:50.320 --> 01:53.320\nyou're bilingual, if you speak one language, you're American.\n\n01:53.320 --> 01:54.320\nYeah.\n\n01:54.320 --> 02:01.880\nWe're, yeah, I mean, we may be back here in November forever.\n\n02:01.880 --> 02:04.800\nI'm sure you've heard that a lot.\n\n02:04.800 --> 02:11.880\nWe'll be very low profile, like we're not going to act like we're allowed to be here.\n\n02:11.880 --> 02:16.800\nWe'll thank you for not building a wall before we get here, and we'll just hang out.\n\n02:16.800 --> 02:20.800\nAnd I will just enjoy sitting in a corner dipping French fries and mayonnaise without\n\n02:20.800 --> 02:21.800\nfeeling creepy.\n\n02:21.800 --> 02:23.960\nLike, I love that so much.\n\n02:23.960 --> 02:28.040\nThank you for that cultural, hey, like, they just brought a bowl of mayonnaise with French\n\n02:28.040 --> 02:31.560\nfries and then just like, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, like the French fries may as well be\n\n02:31.560 --> 02:32.560\na spoon.\n\n02:32.560 --> 02:33.560\nYum, yum.\n\n02:33.560 --> 02:40.400\nIt's just, it's just yummy, yummy, if a gravy on anything you want.\n\n02:40.400 --> 02:43.280\nSo some Montreal Facts, Jeff.\n\n02:43.280 --> 02:44.280\nOh.\n\n02:44.280 --> 02:53.560\nYou know, the typewriter was invented here, and the shoe, the shoe was invented here.\n\n02:53.560 --> 02:54.840\nJust the left one.\n\n02:54.840 --> 02:55.840\nJust the one shoe.\n\n02:55.840 --> 02:56.840\nJust the one shoe.\n\n02:56.840 --> 02:59.280\nIt took another country to invent the other shoe.\n\n02:59.280 --> 03:03.600\nPortugal invented the right shoe.\n\n03:03.600 --> 03:08.280\nAnd did you guys know that for a long time, shoes existed before they figured out to make\n\n03:08.280 --> 03:10.160\nleft and right versions of them?\n\n03:10.160 --> 03:13.280\nThere was just neutral shoes for a long time.\n\n03:13.280 --> 03:15.280\nThat makes sense, I guess.\n\n03:15.280 --> 03:16.280\nYeah, yeah.\n\n03:16.280 --> 03:17.280\nIt's cool.\n\n03:17.280 --> 03:18.280\nI love it.\n\n03:18.280 --> 03:19.280\nCarry on.\n\n03:19.280 --> 03:26.440\nWhat year did we start making feet-specific shoes?\n\n03:26.440 --> 03:31.680\nAncient history, like, maybe Egypt figured it out or something, but a long time ago.\n\n03:31.680 --> 03:32.680\nHow are you, Spencer?\n\n03:32.680 --> 03:33.840\nI noticed you got more applause than I did.\n\n03:33.840 --> 03:34.840\nOh, yeah.\n\n03:34.840 --> 03:37.360\nI don't know about that.\n\n03:37.360 --> 03:38.560\nYou know why?\n\n03:38.560 --> 03:42.720\nBecause you're as Canadian as an American can get.\n\n03:42.720 --> 03:45.440\nYou're like, you know, I meant it as a compliment.\n\n03:45.440 --> 03:50.320\nYeah, you always mean it as a compliment, and I always take it as an insult.\n\n03:50.320 --> 03:51.320\nDo I say it a lot?\n\n03:51.320 --> 03:52.320\nYeah.\n\n03:52.320 --> 03:53.320\nAll the time.\n\n03:53.320 --> 03:54.320\nReally?\n\n03:54.320 --> 03:55.320\nA Canadian piece of shit?\n\n03:55.320 --> 03:56.320\nYeah.\n\n03:56.320 --> 04:01.320\nAnd just, like, well, you, for instance, you know, you missed your flight.\n\n04:01.320 --> 04:04.640\nLike, that's pretty Canadian, because you were probably like, like, why isn't there just\n\n04:04.640 --> 04:08.440\na flight all the time that anyone can just get on, because mass transit?\n\n04:08.440 --> 04:09.440\nRight.\n\n04:09.440 --> 04:11.200\nYou guys love mass transit?\n\n04:11.200 --> 04:13.560\nSo you missed his flight?\n\n04:13.560 --> 04:14.880\nBecause of mass transit.\n\n04:14.880 --> 04:18.240\nIt's connecting dots, just trying to talk about you missing your flight.\n\n04:18.240 --> 04:19.240\nNo, I love it.\n\n04:19.240 --> 04:21.120\nI didn't bring my passport.\n\n04:21.120 --> 04:24.200\nI think that you used to not need a passport.\n\n04:24.200 --> 04:25.200\nI don't know.\n\n04:25.200 --> 04:26.200\nI didn't bring my passport.\n\n04:26.200 --> 04:29.880\nThat was back when people had the same shoe on both feet.\n\n04:29.880 --> 04:34.720\nWe invented countries and left and right shoes in 1928.\n\n04:34.720 --> 04:35.720\nYeah.\n\n04:35.720 --> 04:43.480\nIt was Al Capone invented the right shoe and the passport, and there's stuff flying off\n\n04:43.480 --> 04:44.480\nof my mustache.\n\n04:44.480 --> 04:46.040\nI don't know if you can see that.\n\n04:46.040 --> 04:49.080\nThat means it's going to be a good show.\n\n04:49.080 --> 04:51.360\nI'm a little sober.\n\n04:51.360 --> 04:52.360\nI apologize.\n\n04:52.360 --> 04:54.000\nBut yeah, the bar is not open.\n\n04:54.000 --> 04:58.880\nHow do you have a hotel during a festival at one o'clock p.m. and the bar be shut?\n\n04:58.880 --> 04:59.880\nIt's directly above us.\n\n04:59.880 --> 05:00.880\nI think we hit the ceiling.\n\n05:00.880 --> 05:07.720\nCan we get some drops of booze to trickle down the light fixtures?\n\n05:07.720 --> 05:11.120\nLevy texted us all in a group text this morning telling us where to meet and what the deal\n\n05:11.120 --> 05:12.120\nwas.\n\n05:12.120 --> 05:25.160\nHe said, the show is below the bar, and Jeff said, I'll say, I've got some notes.\n\n05:25.160 --> 05:29.480\nAnd then Spencer said, that's what she said, and we're like, okay, let's make this real\n\n05:29.480 --> 05:30.480\nclear.\n\n05:30.480 --> 05:34.880\nThe woman on the text chain was doing, that's what she said, all morning, and by the time\n\n05:34.880 --> 05:37.560\nI was doing it, it was very clearly ironic.\n\n05:37.560 --> 05:38.560\nOkay.\n\n05:38.560 --> 05:39.560\nAll right.\n\n05:39.560 --> 05:40.560\nThat's what she said.\n\n05:40.560 --> 05:46.560\nSee, then I wrote, then after 100, that's what she said, I wrote, I have a vagina and\n\n05:46.560 --> 05:49.160\nlike to have sex with men, and no one said anything.\n\n05:49.160 --> 05:50.160\nAnd nobody said anything.\n\n05:50.160 --> 05:51.160\nYeah.\n\n05:51.160 --> 05:54.160\nYou guys find it hard to get.\n\n05:54.160 --> 05:57.760\nThat's proof that that's what she said doesn't actually mean that's what she said.\n\n05:57.760 --> 05:58.760\nRight.\n\n05:58.760 --> 05:59.760\nIt means something else.\n\n05:59.760 --> 06:01.320\nI don't know what it means.\n\n06:01.320 --> 06:03.680\nWe don't know who she is, why she keeps saying stuff.\n\n06:03.680 --> 06:04.680\nShe's pretty chatty.\n\n06:04.680 --> 06:09.680\nShe says a lot of stuff.\n\n06:09.680 --> 06:11.360\nAll right.\n\n06:11.360 --> 06:12.880\nSo let me just look at my...\n\n06:12.880 --> 06:14.480\nYou have a monitor down.\n\n06:14.480 --> 06:16.480\nDo you see yourself down here?\n\n06:16.480 --> 06:18.480\nOh, Jesus.\n\n06:18.480 --> 06:22.560\nYou can see the own stuff flying up your own mustache.\n\n06:22.560 --> 06:27.320\nI took off all my clothes in San Diego, and I was looking at screen grabs of it, and\n\n06:27.320 --> 06:31.920\nI was like, I got to get on the elliptical, but then I just ate a quarter pounder with\n\n06:31.920 --> 06:40.560\nfromage downstairs, fries with mayonnaise, I fucking hate myself so much, just a fucking\n\n06:40.560 --> 06:42.040\ndisgusting monster.\n\n06:42.040 --> 06:48.320\nJust imagine being my girlfriend and just like looking up at this fucking giant, like\n\n06:48.320 --> 06:55.320\ngross flappy tits, like bouncing up and down, and like I like grit my teeth and go, eugh,\n\n06:55.320 --> 07:11.240\neugh, I made a TV show once, I'm going to come thinking about my TV show, looking at\n\n07:11.240 --> 07:17.400\nmy own tits.\n\n07:17.400 --> 07:18.400\nShe's a saint.\n\n07:18.400 --> 07:19.400\nShe's a good woman.\n\n07:19.400 --> 07:25.320\nOn the flight here, a guy I'm dating sent, I left a little, like, little lovely post-it\n\n07:25.320 --> 07:30.800\nnotes around the crib, and she was texting Cody, Dan's girlfriend, and she said, oh,\n\n07:30.800 --> 07:35.440\nlook, she took a picture of one of her post-it notes that I love you on the fridge, and Cody\n\n07:35.440 --> 07:37.920\ngoes, oh, Dan, shit the bed.\n\n07:37.920 --> 07:38.920\nOkay.\n\n07:38.920 --> 07:45.680\nWell, I was saving that for later, but it was only a matter of time, you've heard me\n\n07:45.680 --> 07:51.040\ntalk on the podcast about shitting my pants a lot, and what is a bed but a large pair\n\n07:51.040 --> 07:56.680\nof pants you wear for eight hours of your day, and so, of course, it was a matter of\n\n07:56.680 --> 07:58.680\ntime before I actually took a picture.\n\n07:58.680 --> 07:59.680\nYou're wearing those giant pants a third of your life.\n\n07:59.680 --> 08:02.600\nYou're going to poop those pants as much.\n\n08:02.600 --> 08:09.080\nI mean, so, like, I'm on this, I know I don't look like it, but I'm on this soylent diet\n\n08:09.080 --> 08:14.600\nback at home, like, I'm just trying to, you know, like, if I, and if I'm on the soylent\n\n08:14.600 --> 08:18.640\nlong enough, like, for a couple of days, it's like, you know, I'm just, I'm just teeing\n\n08:18.640 --> 08:23.040\nit up, like, I don't want you to worry about me, like, that I'm always shitting uncontrollably.\n\n08:23.040 --> 08:29.280\nI, like, I, so, I just, just full disclosure, and, like, I mean, I just have to tell you\n\n08:29.280 --> 08:34.600\neverything, because I was like, this is like, how did you, what happened, and I was like,\n\n08:34.600 --> 08:39.680\nI was, I was masturbating, and so, I, I, and I'm,\n\n08:39.680 --> 08:40.680\nSo you shake yourself.\n\n08:40.680 --> 08:47.360\nI'm a, I'm a, I'm a kneeler, and I, so I had my laptop open in front of me, and I was\n\n08:47.360 --> 08:48.360\nkneeling.\n\n08:48.360 --> 08:49.360\nOkay.\n\n08:49.360 --> 08:50.360\nCan I pause for a second?\n\n08:50.360 --> 08:54.680\nYou don't have to applaud, but by applause, does anybody, anybody, anybody hear a kneeler\n\n08:54.680 --> 08:55.680\nwhen they masturbate?\n\n08:55.680 --> 08:56.680\nYeah, that's what I thought.\n\n08:56.680 --> 08:57.680\nOh, okay.\n\n08:57.680 --> 08:58.680\nReally?\n\n08:58.680 --> 08:59.680\nIt's not, I think a thing?\n\n08:59.680 --> 09:00.680\nAre you?\n\n09:00.680 --> 09:01.680\nAre you?\n\n09:01.680 --> 09:02.680\nYou'll kneel?\n\n09:02.680 --> 09:04.320\nWas there a gal applauding to you next year?\n\n09:04.320 --> 09:06.880\nYou're also, I can't really see, are you a gal?\n\n09:06.880 --> 09:07.880\nYes.\n\n09:07.880 --> 09:08.880\nYou're a kneeler too?\n\n09:08.880 --> 09:09.880\nYou have.\n\n09:09.880 --> 09:13.680\nYou have, you have knelts, but you're not a kneeler.\n\n09:13.680 --> 09:14.680\nLike a kneeler.\n\n09:14.680 --> 09:15.680\nYeah.\n\n09:15.680 --> 09:16.680\nI've done all kinds of shit.\n\n09:16.680 --> 09:17.680\nYeah.\n\n09:17.680 --> 09:20.680\nI, I put a pen on my ass, but I'm not an ass-penner.\n\n09:20.680 --> 09:26.880\nLike, I, I've done meth, but I'm not a meth-er, like, I'm just a, I'm just an adventurer.\n\n09:26.880 --> 09:30.800\nI'm a, I'm a tourist, I'm a connoisseur of, of variety.\n\n09:30.800 --> 09:33.280\nThere's no other dedicated kneeler here, no?\n\n09:33.280 --> 09:35.800\nBut I really, I, I really, I'm actually surprised by that.\n\n09:35.800 --> 09:39.160\nI've never bothered to ask, because like, for instance, watch this, like, how many people\n\n09:39.160 --> 09:41.800\nhere wipe their ass standing up?\n\n09:41.800 --> 09:42.800\nSometimes.\n\n09:42.800 --> 09:43.800\nSee?\n\n09:43.800 --> 09:47.320\nI know it's embarrassed, and you have to double that because who's gonna clap?\n\n09:47.320 --> 09:52.520\nThe brave, and the, and the single, or, or, or, no, no, the other way around, it's probably\n\n09:52.520 --> 09:54.120\nthe people in couples.\n\n09:54.120 --> 09:55.120\nLike, yeah.\n\n09:55.120 --> 09:59.120\nBut, but, but the, but that's like a really specific thing that you would think is kind\n\n09:59.120 --> 10:00.120\nof weird.\n\n10:00.120 --> 10:05.600\nAnd like, it's a, you know, like 40% of the world wipes their ass standing up.\n\n10:05.600 --> 10:07.100\nBut no kneelers.\n\n10:07.100 --> 10:09.440\nSo there's something really weird about me.\n\n10:09.440 --> 10:10.780\nLike, I don't know what it is.\n\n10:10.780 --> 10:13.820\nWhat percent of the world doesn't have squat toilets, though?\n\n10:13.820 --> 10:15.420\nDoes that line up?\n\n10:15.420 --> 10:17.100\nLike, because in a squat toilet, you probably\n\n10:17.100 --> 10:18.820\nhave to stand a white.\n\n10:18.820 --> 10:21.180\nOh, well, I don't know how that figures in.\n\n10:21.180 --> 10:22.580\nI just looked at it.\n\n10:22.580 --> 10:24.140\nWe could get someone on that.\n\n10:24.140 --> 10:27.500\nI bet it's like 40% of the Western, like, sitting toilet\n\n10:27.500 --> 10:28.020\nworld.\n\n10:28.020 --> 10:28.740\nOh, OK.\n\n10:28.740 --> 10:29.700\nWell, fuck it.\n\n10:29.700 --> 10:31.020\nBut I'm just guessing.\n\n10:31.020 --> 10:31.780\nYeah, yeah.\n\n10:31.780 --> 10:34.060\nWe should have like a Harmontown statistician.\n\n10:34.060 --> 10:36.220\nLike, somebody's up here and just pulling up stats for us.\n\n10:36.220 --> 10:36.980\nYeah.\n\n10:36.980 --> 10:37.500\nIt sounds like it.\n\n10:37.500 --> 10:41.740\nDid you know that Montreal is the fourth largest country\n\n10:41.740 --> 10:42.220\nin the world?\n\n10:45.060 --> 10:49.100\nAnd they have the 16th largest navy.\n\n10:49.100 --> 10:54.820\nAnd each sailor gets their own typewriter.\n\n10:54.820 --> 10:57.460\nAnd who's the current prime minister of Canada, then?\n\n10:57.460 --> 11:00.980\nKing Geraldo.\n\n11:00.980 --> 11:03.300\nHe just has one name.\n\n11:03.300 --> 11:05.860\nAnd he's a very controversial figure.\n\n11:05.860 --> 11:09.220\nHe's run for four terms.\n\n11:09.220 --> 11:12.060\nAnd he loves pickles.\n\n11:12.060 --> 11:14.180\nAnd the metric system.\n\n11:14.180 --> 11:16.060\nThey make a king run for election?\n\n11:16.060 --> 11:18.220\nMm-hmm.\n\n11:18.220 --> 11:19.100\nYes.\n\n11:19.100 --> 11:21.340\nAnd they call feet yards.\n\n11:21.340 --> 11:23.860\nHere, did you know that?\n\n11:23.860 --> 11:27.900\nFeet are yards, these people.\n\n11:27.900 --> 11:29.020\nYou got to love them.\n\n11:29.020 --> 11:30.860\nTheir trolleys don't have wheels.\n\n11:30.860 --> 11:35.540\nThey have sleds, little sleds on them.\n\n11:35.540 --> 11:39.780\nIf you say, excuse me, that means fuck you.\n\n11:39.780 --> 11:42.700\nPants are napkins.\n\n11:42.700 --> 11:48.900\nGlasses are an insult to your mother's family,\n\n11:48.900 --> 11:50.100\nwhich is your family as well.\n\n11:54.820 --> 11:56.100\nIt's just on the matrilineal side.\n\n11:56.100 --> 11:58.620\nExcuse me.\n\n11:58.620 --> 11:59.300\nWhoa, whoa, whoa.\n\n11:59.300 --> 12:00.020\nPiece of shit.\n\n12:00.020 --> 12:00.520\nWhoa.\n\n12:03.540 --> 12:04.980\nAll right, so you're masturbating.\n\n12:04.980 --> 12:06.940\nYou're about to shake yourself.\n\n12:06.940 --> 12:08.460\nAll right, all right.\n\n12:08.460 --> 12:10.500\nLet's stay on target here, dad.\n\n12:10.500 --> 12:13.460\nWell, maybe we should parcel this thing out.\n\n12:13.460 --> 12:14.780\nIt'll be like Spalding Grey.\n\n12:14.780 --> 12:16.220\nLike, I'll take you up to a little point,\n\n12:16.220 --> 12:17.900\nand then I'll talk about some other stuff.\n\n12:17.900 --> 12:21.140\nAnd then I'll go, OK, so here I am, naked and squatting on the.\n\n12:21.140 --> 12:22.780\nSo I wonder what it is.\n\n12:22.780 --> 12:24.740\nI think maybe it's, who knows?\n\n12:24.740 --> 12:25.980\nI don't know why I'm a kneeler.\n\n12:25.980 --> 12:26.460\nI don't know.\n\n12:26.460 --> 12:28.540\nI really thought there would be a couple kneelers in here.\n\n12:28.540 --> 12:29.900\nLike, really, like, I can.\n\n12:29.900 --> 12:31.060\nIs there an origin story?\n\n12:31.060 --> 12:34.820\nI can bring myself to orgasm easily enough,\n\n12:34.820 --> 12:39.900\nlaying down, or maybe sitting in the lotus position.\n\n12:39.900 --> 12:40.380\nI don't know.\n\n12:40.380 --> 12:42.820\nLike, I can.\n\n12:42.820 --> 12:45.020\nAre there any lotusers here?\n\n12:45.020 --> 12:48.140\nI can finish in a variety of ways.\n\n12:48.140 --> 12:51.740\nBut when it comes to, like, OK, I have work in 10 minutes.\n\n12:51.740 --> 12:53.940\nLike, the Uber's on its way.\n\n12:53.940 --> 12:56.660\nLike, I'm a kneeler.\n\n12:56.660 --> 12:59.060\nDo you flex your legs when you're kneeling?\n\n12:59.060 --> 13:01.860\nOr are you just trying to be as neutral as possible?\n\n13:01.860 --> 13:03.180\nLike, are your legs doing anything?\n\n13:03.180 --> 13:05.860\nOr are they just propping you up to jerk off?\n\n13:05.860 --> 13:11.260\nBecause, like, sometimes when I'm, like, feeling good,\n\n13:11.260 --> 13:14.220\nsometimes when I'm feeling good flexing,\n\n13:14.220 --> 13:15.860\nflexing those muscles helps.\n\n13:15.860 --> 13:17.100\nIt, like, it makes me feel different.\n\n13:17.100 --> 13:18.380\nI sit on my heels.\n\n13:18.380 --> 13:19.180\nRight.\n\n13:19.180 --> 13:20.100\nOK.\n\n13:20.100 --> 13:21.980\nSo you're like, you look like.\n\n13:21.980 --> 13:24.340\nYou aren't shitting while you're, like, upright.\n\n13:24.340 --> 13:26.540\nYou're kind of in just a modified sitting position.\n\n13:26.540 --> 13:28.860\nWell, this isn't how I shit, just so to make it clear.\n\n13:28.860 --> 13:31.580\nThis is how I shitting lower heels.\n\n13:31.580 --> 13:33.820\nWhat I was doing when I shit once.\n\n13:33.820 --> 13:37.860\nWe're going to start the show in a couple minutes and just.\n\n13:37.860 --> 13:41.340\nBut I, so I was, I had the laptop open and I'm kneeling.\n\n13:41.340 --> 13:44.220\nAnd I, and I, and I, again, with the Soylent.\n\n13:44.220 --> 13:46.940\nAnd also, I've recently discovered, like,\n\n13:46.940 --> 13:49.860\noh, a little, a couple, a couple of toots on a vape pen.\n\n13:49.860 --> 13:50.700\nYou know?\n\n13:50.700 --> 13:52.980\nLike, makes masturbation more palatable.\n\n13:52.980 --> 13:53.660\nSure.\n\n13:53.660 --> 13:54.220\nPalatable.\n\n13:54.220 --> 13:55.220\nLike, it's not palatable.\n\n13:55.220 --> 13:56.700\nYeah, it's tough, but it is.\n\n13:56.700 --> 13:58.700\nI mean, you know, makes it, like, you know,\n\n13:58.700 --> 14:01.540\nit's like less of a drag.\n\n14:01.540 --> 14:04.780\nIf you get, if you get, if you get high on marijuana,\n\n14:04.780 --> 14:08.220\nlike, it's, it's, it's fun to jerk off.\n\n14:08.220 --> 14:09.940\nFunder.\n\n14:09.940 --> 14:13.860\nAnd so I, but I, and I, so I took a little hit of a joint\n\n14:13.860 --> 14:15.660\nand I was kneeling.\n\n14:15.660 --> 14:16.500\nAnd I.\n\n14:16.500 --> 14:18.140\nThis is last night?\n\n14:18.140 --> 14:20.180\nNo, this is when I, this is when I.\n\n14:20.180 --> 14:21.500\nOh, two nights ago, rather, yeah.\n\n14:21.500 --> 14:22.500\nAnd I coughed.\n\n14:26.300 --> 14:26.860\nI'll do it.\n\n14:26.860 --> 14:29.460\nAnd then, and then I didn't, I didn't know.\n\n14:29.460 --> 14:33.780\nI was like, that was a hot one, but, you know,\n\n14:33.780 --> 14:34.660\nand then I jerked off.\n\n14:34.660 --> 14:36.020\nAnd then I, but I didn't know.\n\n14:36.020 --> 14:41.100\nAnd then I, like, I guess I, that I fell asleep like.\n\n14:41.100 --> 14:44.100\nOh, no.\n\n14:44.100 --> 14:46.740\nJesus Christ.\n\n14:46.740 --> 14:47.900\nIt's a blasé attitude.\n\n14:47.900 --> 14:49.940\nBut you just described, you just showed us how you did it.\n\n14:49.940 --> 14:50.940\nDidn't you poop on your feet?\n\n14:50.940 --> 14:52.260\nCause you, you, you probably saw something.\n\n14:52.260 --> 14:54.740\nNo, this is, my feet aren't underneath my butthole.\n\n14:54.740 --> 14:55.260\nThey were.\n\n14:55.260 --> 14:59.420\nLike, I'm not like a, the land of lakes girl, like.\n\n14:59.420 --> 15:03.500\nI'm like, you know, I got you.\n\n15:03.500 --> 15:04.260\nAll right.\n\n15:04.260 --> 15:06.900\nSo I'm like a guy on a New York subway.\n\n15:06.900 --> 15:11.380\nI'm about three-seater with my, my spread.\n\n15:11.380 --> 15:11.700\nOkay.\n\n15:11.700 --> 15:15.140\nSo you, you, you, you, you drift off to sleep.\n\n15:15.140 --> 15:17.180\nAnd I, and I get up and I got to go do something.\n\n15:17.180 --> 15:21.180\nAnd I look, I go, oh boy, I pooped in the bed.\n\n15:21.180 --> 15:23.700\nI see it and I go, I don't have time to do anything with you.\n\n15:23.700 --> 15:24.660\nNo, she wasn't it.\n\n15:24.660 --> 15:27.580\nWhy would I be kneeling and masturbating and farting?\n\n15:27.580 --> 15:30.180\nI mean, maybe she came in later on and joined you in bed.\n\n15:30.180 --> 15:33.740\nNo, that's the reason why this is all public knowledge now\n\n15:33.740 --> 15:37.220\nis because before we let, we were supposed to meet because,\n\n15:37.220 --> 15:39.380\nto, to, to get, because we were going to,\n\n15:39.380 --> 15:41.540\nshe was going to spend the night and we had an early flight\n\n15:41.540 --> 15:43.460\nto come to Montreal.\n\n15:43.460 --> 15:49.940\nAnd like, I, so she, I was at work and she, and then Levy,\n\n15:49.940 --> 15:53.820\nI had told Levy that I pooped in the bed, Steve Levy.\n\n15:53.820 --> 15:57.060\nThat seemed more like a Spencer task, isn't it?\n\n15:57.060 --> 15:59.180\nIt's nobody's task, but I said, I didn't tell,\n\n15:59.180 --> 16:00.820\nI wasn't telling him so we would clean it up.\n\n16:00.820 --> 16:03.220\nI was just saying, Spencer, are you jealous that Steve's\n\n16:03.220 --> 16:04.700\nleaving out the call?\n\n16:04.700 --> 16:05.900\nI would have been real jealous.\n\n16:05.900 --> 16:07.580\nYeah.\n\n16:07.580 --> 16:12.500\nI was just, I was said to Levy like, like, like make sure I get,\n\n16:12.500 --> 16:14.740\nI need to get home before Cody gets there.\n\n16:14.740 --> 16:18.020\nI need to beat her home, like, because I have some things to\n\n16:18.020 --> 16:19.340\ntend to, I pooped in the bed.\n\n16:19.340 --> 16:20.780\nYou just left it there for the day.\n\n16:20.780 --> 16:22.540\nI had no choice.\n\n16:22.540 --> 16:23.340\nI had to leave.\n\n16:23.340 --> 16:25.100\nYou're throwing the laundry.\n\n16:25.100 --> 16:26.780\nI didn't have time to do anything.\n\n16:26.780 --> 16:29.860\nDid you guys just leave the poop on the bed?\n\n16:29.860 --> 16:32.700\nWell, I did.\n\n16:32.700 --> 16:34.220\nCody just, Cody's texting me.\n\n16:34.220 --> 16:37.100\nShe said, don't forget the reason you had to tell me was\n\n16:37.100 --> 16:38.420\nbecause of the new sheets.\n\n16:38.420 --> 16:40.940\nYes, OK.\n\n16:40.940 --> 16:45.060\nSo the sheets I pooped on were brand new sheets that Cody had\n\n16:45.060 --> 16:47.700\nlike found on Amazon because I have a King,\n\n16:47.700 --> 16:51.340\nCalifornia King mattress and, and so she found, I'm going to,\n\n16:51.340 --> 16:52.460\nit's getting a little hot up here.\n\n16:52.460 --> 16:55.620\nI'm going to take off my sweatshirt.\n\n16:55.620 --> 16:58.100\nDon't poop yourself.\n\n16:58.100 --> 17:03.220\nI don't know why I'd be sweating up here telling this story.\n\n17:06.220 --> 17:08.100\nGod damn it.\n\n17:08.100 --> 17:10.780\nSuch a fucking gross monster.\n\n17:10.780 --> 17:15.580\nSo I shit on the fucking new sheets that she, so I knew,\n\n17:15.580 --> 17:18.780\neven if I, even if the, even if I knew that if she got home\n\n17:18.780 --> 17:22.260\nbefore me, that she'd see that the new sheets came and she'd\n\n17:22.260 --> 17:25.300\nbe excited, like I knew she'd like want to look at them.\n\n17:25.300 --> 17:28.060\nAll of them, you know, she'd like whip back the DeVay and go,\n\n17:28.060 --> 17:28.780\nlook at these new sheets.\n\n17:28.780 --> 17:29.820\nYou covered us up with the DeVay?\n\n17:29.820 --> 17:32.700\nI didn't cover it up.\n\n17:32.700 --> 17:34.580\nOK, I guess I maybe, I guess I might.\n\n17:34.580 --> 17:35.540\nGeez.\n\n17:35.540 --> 17:36.100\nOh no.\n\n17:36.100 --> 17:37.620\nYou're a fucking villain.\n\n17:37.620 --> 17:40.220\nI'm not, I wasn't trying to hide it from anybody.\n\n17:40.220 --> 17:43.020\nI, I have a dog sitter, so I didn't want her to have to look\n\n17:43.020 --> 17:43.780\nat shit.\n\n17:43.780 --> 17:46.300\nI just figured that she came in the room to get the dogs and\n\n17:46.300 --> 17:49.420\nthen she, maybe she'd see that I didn't want anyone to have\n\n17:49.420 --> 17:51.820\nto deal with my things, you know?\n\n17:51.820 --> 17:53.780\nI don't want to have to, people have to see things that would\n\n17:53.780 --> 17:56.420\nmake them, you know, have to never unsee them, you know?\n\n17:56.420 --> 17:58.820\nLike, I don't want people to have to think about who I really\n\n17:58.820 --> 18:01.060\nam, it's a burden on people.\n\n18:01.060 --> 18:04.100\nIt's like, it's like, it's like going to Vietnam, knowing me,\n\n18:04.100 --> 18:07.020\nlike knowing little things, if you could, you could see things\n\n18:07.020 --> 18:10.220\nthat would, that would be the equivalent of like, seeing a,\n\n18:10.220 --> 18:11.500\na beheading or something.\n\n18:11.500 --> 18:20.860\nSo, now you're, you're, you're, so she's texting me and I go,\n\n18:20.860 --> 18:25.420\nI just, let me see if I can find the conversation.\n\n18:25.420 --> 18:30.540\nShe was, I, I, Steve, Steve comes running in and he goes\n\n18:30.540 --> 18:33.220\nlike, Cody's on her way to your house.\n\n18:33.220 --> 18:35.460\nAnd she has a key.\n\n18:35.460 --> 18:36.340\nScrolling.\n\n18:36.340 --> 18:39.620\nAnd I, and he knows why that's dangerous.\n\n18:39.620 --> 18:40.740\nRight.\n\n18:40.740 --> 18:42.260\nThis is like high noon all of a sudden.\n\n18:42.260 --> 18:45.300\nWe should have locked the gate.\n\n18:45.300 --> 18:47.380\nShe couldn't even use her house key that way.\n\n18:47.380 --> 18:49.940\nI don't, I wasn't thinking when I left the house, I have to\n\n18:49.940 --> 18:51.220\nkeep Cody out of the house.\n\n18:51.220 --> 18:54.460\nI was thinking, I have to come home early and clean up my shit.\n\n18:54.460 --> 18:55.500\nThat's a good thought.\n\n18:59.500 --> 19:00.900\nI'm just looking for this.\n\n19:00.900 --> 19:01.500\nSorry.\n\n19:01.500 --> 19:06.860\nIt's a, let's all look up stuff on our phones.\n\n19:06.860 --> 19:10.420\nOh, Spencer, talk about the one pen thing on airplanes.\n\n19:10.420 --> 19:12.860\nThis is called, this is a segment called, let's uncork\n\n19:12.860 --> 19:14.180\nSpencer's rage.\n\n19:14.180 --> 19:15.740\nYeah.\n\n19:15.740 --> 19:20.180\nSo when you fly here, you got to fill out a sheet.\n\n19:20.180 --> 19:21.340\nI don't even know why.\n\n19:21.340 --> 19:23.580\nI guess it's just so like they know if you're taking like\n\n19:23.580 --> 19:25.740\nlarge amounts of money into the country or like\n\n19:25.740 --> 19:26.740\nplants or something.\n\n19:26.740 --> 19:27.540\nI don't know.\n\n19:27.540 --> 19:29.780\nBut you got to fill out a sheet, but then they don't have\n\n19:29.780 --> 19:33.900\nany pens on the plane because pens are very expensive.\n\n19:33.900 --> 19:35.740\nWe all know this.\n\n19:35.740 --> 19:38.500\nHow much, how much money have you guys spent in pens in the\n\n19:38.500 --> 19:39.140\nlast year?\n\n19:39.140 --> 19:42.260\nBecause for me, it's at least $1,000.\n\n19:42.260 --> 19:45.060\nAnd I'm not even an airline.\n\n19:45.060 --> 19:49.180\nAnd God knows on an airplane, like spaces at a premiums and\n\n19:49.180 --> 19:53.060\npens are so bulky, they're like, they're like a million hot\n\n19:53.060 --> 19:57.780\ntowels worth of space or shitty meals or fucking weird\n\n19:57.780 --> 20:01.420\ncrackers or all the other crap they jam into a plane.\n\n20:01.420 --> 20:04.660\nAnd it's not like you can place them in a bag.\n\n20:04.660 --> 20:07.380\nNo, they fall right out.\n\n20:07.380 --> 20:09.980\nAnd they'd make a lousy promotional tool because you\n\n20:09.980 --> 20:11.620\ncan't put your logo on them.\n\n20:11.620 --> 20:12.540\nNo.\n\n20:12.540 --> 20:13.980\nAnd no one ever needs one.\n\n20:13.980 --> 20:16.300\nAnd they never give one to anyone else.\n\n20:16.300 --> 20:19.700\nAnd everyone's always traveling with writing utensils.\n\n20:19.700 --> 20:22.460\nAny time I go out of the door, I have writing utensils.\n\n20:22.460 --> 20:24.300\nI got a colored pencil set.\n\n20:24.300 --> 20:30.420\nWallet, key, phone, ballpoint pen, because I'm a form filler.\n\n20:30.420 --> 20:31.140\nYeah.\n\n20:31.140 --> 20:32.580\nThat's what we do.\n\n20:32.580 --> 20:36.220\nAnd also just writing on paper is so today, it's so\n\n20:36.220 --> 20:36.820\nuseful.\n\n20:36.820 --> 20:40.180\nLike everyone's writing just stuff down on pieces of paper\n\n20:40.180 --> 20:42.620\nthese days.\n\n20:42.620 --> 20:45.100\nYou'd think that they'd have taken care of that with note\n\n20:45.100 --> 20:48.980\ntaking apps on phones or word processors on computers.\n\n20:48.980 --> 20:50.980\nAnyway, they don't have any fucking pens.\n\n20:50.980 --> 20:52.380\nThey make you fill out a form.\n\n20:52.380 --> 20:55.220\nBut the thing is, there are pens on the plane, but God help\n\n20:55.220 --> 20:57.580\nyou if you get off the plane without filling out that form.\n\n20:57.580 --> 21:00.980\nBecause in the way to get out of the airport, there's\n\n21:00.980 --> 21:02.660\nabsolutely no one who will give you a pen.\n\n21:02.660 --> 21:05.100\nAnd they'll tell you they're not allowed to give you a pen.\n\n21:05.100 --> 21:06.100\nOr they did last time.\n\n21:06.100 --> 21:06.460\nI don't know.\n\n21:06.460 --> 21:08.380\nThis time I brought it from the guy next to me.\n\n21:08.380 --> 21:14.340\nBut then you're just trapped in another country without\n\n21:14.340 --> 21:17.020\ncellular data service, in most cases.\n\n21:17.020 --> 21:20.580\nAnd you have to fill out a form without any ability to fill\n\n21:20.580 --> 21:21.140\nout a form.\n\n21:21.140 --> 21:22.900\nLike there's literally nothing you can do.\n\n21:22.900 --> 21:25.380\nYou can't go to a store and buy a pen because you're not on\n\n21:25.380 --> 21:26.700\nthat side of the thing.\n\n21:26.700 --> 21:30.300\nSo you're just stuck in this legal limbo where you have to\n\n21:30.300 --> 21:32.180\nfill out this form that says I'm not carrying\n\n21:32.180 --> 21:34.980\nplants or $20,000.\n\n21:34.980 --> 21:36.380\nHow often does that come up?\n\n21:36.380 --> 21:38.140\nWho gets that information?\n\n21:38.140 --> 21:40.940\nHow do they know if you're lying?\n\n21:40.940 --> 21:43.220\nWhat if your address is off by a digit?\n\n21:43.220 --> 21:44.700\nLike who gives a shit?\n\n21:44.700 --> 21:47.220\nIf they're able to catch you in that, then why don't they\n\n21:47.220 --> 21:48.060\nhave the information?\n\n21:48.060 --> 21:49.980\nWhy would you have to fill out a form?\n\n21:49.980 --> 21:51.220\nHowever they would have kept it.\n\n21:51.220 --> 21:54.140\nOh, so you live at 123 Hibiscus?\n\n21:54.140 --> 21:55.140\nSure.\n\n21:55.140 --> 21:57.060\nHa.\n\n21:57.060 --> 22:00.180\nBut what are they catching with that process?\n\n22:00.180 --> 22:01.620\nThe guy asked me a million questions.\n\n22:01.620 --> 22:02.980\nI don't fucking know where I'm going.\n\n22:02.980 --> 22:04.180\nHow are we going to leave them?\n\n22:04.180 --> 22:05.220\nWhat are you doing in Montreal?\n\n22:05.220 --> 22:06.420\nI'm here for the festival.\n\n22:06.420 --> 22:07.660\nWhat?\n\n22:07.660 --> 22:09.100\nThe guys kept saying what every time.\n\n22:09.100 --> 22:11.260\nI'm like, if your job is to interrogate dumb fat\n\n22:11.260 --> 22:14.580\nAmericans coming into your country, learn to recognize\n\n22:14.580 --> 22:17.140\nmumbling.\n\n22:17.140 --> 22:19.780\nI was like, I'm here for the Just for Laughs Festival.\n\n22:19.780 --> 22:20.460\nWhat?\n\n22:20.460 --> 22:23.140\nI was here for the Just for Laughs Festival.\n\n22:23.140 --> 22:27.140\nOh, do you have a letter?\n\n22:27.140 --> 22:28.980\nA letter?\n\n22:28.980 --> 22:32.540\nI haven't had a letter since 1989.\n\n22:32.540 --> 22:33.580\nWho has a letter?\n\n22:33.580 --> 22:35.980\nWhat am I, Paul Revere?\n\n22:35.980 --> 22:37.220\nDo I have a letter?\n\n22:37.220 --> 22:38.540\nIs this Game of Thrones?\n\n22:38.540 --> 22:39.900\nWhat the fuck are you talking about?\n\n22:39.900 --> 22:41.500\nDo you have a radio?\n\n22:41.500 --> 22:45.980\nI sent it for a crow so I can enter your fucking house\n\n22:45.980 --> 22:46.460\ntully.\n\n22:46.460 --> 22:47.180\nWhat the fuck?\n\n22:47.180 --> 22:48.060\nWhat?\n\n22:48.060 --> 22:50.140\nNow, Canadian customs people are much nicer\n\n22:50.140 --> 22:51.820\nthan the US customs people.\n\n22:51.820 --> 22:53.620\nYeah, but there's still customs people.\n\n22:53.620 --> 22:58.660\nThat's like saying, oh, my turgid is more fiber in it.\n\n22:58.660 --> 23:01.580\nI think two times, Greg Proops, we travel to Canada a lot.\n\n23:01.580 --> 23:05.900\nAnd Greg Proops, the comedian and friend of the show,\n\n23:05.900 --> 23:09.340\nhe twice, so what's your occupation?\n\n23:09.340 --> 23:10.940\nHe goes, I'm a comedian.\n\n23:10.940 --> 23:14.700\nAnd I go, no, it's like you're an American.\n\n23:14.700 --> 23:15.900\nI didn't say it was Canadian.\n\n23:15.900 --> 23:16.900\nI said it was a comedian.\n\n23:16.900 --> 23:18.820\nThat's twice that's happened from a comedian.\n\n23:22.660 --> 23:26.020\nLike you'd go up to customs and be like, I'm a Canadian.\n\n23:26.020 --> 23:28.420\nLet me in for a living.\n\n23:28.420 --> 23:30.220\nThat's how I make my money.\n\n23:30.220 --> 23:31.420\nBut I go, I'm a Canadian.\n\n23:31.420 --> 23:32.580\nDo you have a letter?\n\n23:32.580 --> 23:33.500\nWhat are you talking about?\n\n23:33.500 --> 23:35.980\nAnd he says, oh, usually there's a letter.\n\n23:35.980 --> 23:37.580\nAn invitation to perform a question.\n\n23:37.580 --> 23:38.780\nAnd then they send you a letter.\n\n23:38.780 --> 23:40.620\nI'm like, well, I guess that letter\n\n23:40.620 --> 23:42.900\nwould get sent to a letter receiver.\n\n23:42.900 --> 23:46.020\nI am a performer.\n\n23:46.020 --> 23:48.100\nI am an artist.\n\n23:48.100 --> 23:50.820\nHe's like, oh, well, sir, are you traveling with a party?\n\n23:50.820 --> 23:51.660\nI said, yes, I am.\n\n23:51.660 --> 23:53.740\nAnd he said, so where are you going?\n\n23:53.740 --> 23:56.780\nI said, your mom's house.\n\n23:56.780 --> 23:57.940\nI said, a hotel.\n\n23:57.940 --> 23:58.860\nWhich one?\n\n23:58.860 --> 24:01.060\nI don't know.\n\n24:01.060 --> 24:02.540\nWe had the exact same conversation.\n\n24:02.540 --> 24:03.860\nI'm hard going to pick me up.\n\n24:03.860 --> 24:07.060\nLike, I have left that brain space\n\n24:07.060 --> 24:10.180\nfree for hilarious stories about shitting in a bed.\n\n24:10.180 --> 24:12.980\nMeanwhile, Seth Rogen was on our flight.\n\n24:12.980 --> 24:15.420\nAnd that dude got shot out of there on a magic carpet.\n\n24:15.420 --> 24:16.700\nHe didn't do anything.\n\n24:16.700 --> 24:18.340\nThere was a good-looking middle-aged woman\n\n24:18.340 --> 24:20.260\nwho picked him up and just like put him up.\n\n24:20.260 --> 24:23.060\nLike they carried him out on a litter like Cleopatra.\n\n24:23.060 --> 24:24.660\nAnd he just fucking, it was amazing.\n\n24:24.660 --> 24:27.100\nYeah, I was looking at Seth Rogen like on the plane.\n\n24:27.100 --> 24:28.740\nAnd I was just thinking about that.\n\n24:28.740 --> 24:31.340\nI'm like, does he have to fill out this fucking form\n\n24:31.340 --> 24:32.380\nand look for a pen?\n\n24:32.380 --> 24:33.060\nI bet he doesn't.\n\n24:33.060 --> 24:36.060\nI bet Alec Baldwin doesn't go to the DMV.\n\n24:36.060 --> 24:38.140\nOr that's a driver thing.\n\n24:38.140 --> 24:39.820\nI don't know if they call it here.\n\n24:39.820 --> 24:49.100\nLe cart de la department of the fromage vehicles.\n\n24:49.100 --> 24:52.660\nVehicle Le Mans.\n\n24:52.660 --> 24:55.540\nWhy is he mocking our language?\n\n24:55.540 --> 24:57.340\nLook at him.\n\n24:57.340 --> 25:00.380\nAnd why is he entitled to leap across the border\n\n25:00.380 --> 25:04.580\nwith no letter?\n\n25:04.580 --> 25:06.380\nI mean, I don't think I'm entitled.\n\n25:06.380 --> 25:07.820\nYou should lock me out if you want.\n\n25:07.820 --> 25:09.540\nBut I was calling the guys bluff.\n\n25:09.540 --> 25:11.260\nI'm like thinking, let's see where this goes.\n\n25:11.260 --> 25:13.700\nAm I going to go to Guantanamo?\n\n25:13.700 --> 25:16.340\nI've been taking a secondary screening in Canada.\n\n25:16.340 --> 25:19.580\nAnd I got everything but being duct taped to a folding chair.\n\n25:19.580 --> 25:20.740\nIt was like, they sent me there.\n\n25:20.740 --> 25:22.820\nI went through all my shit and gave me a look.\n\n25:22.820 --> 25:25.500\nHe did write a 94 on the bottom of my thing.\n\n25:25.500 --> 25:27.020\nAnd I was like, I passed.\n\n25:27.020 --> 25:30.060\nBut then Cody's had like a 63 or something.\n\n25:30.060 --> 25:32.460\nI was like, wait, is this percentage chance you're\n\n25:32.460 --> 25:35.220\na terrorist for the next people that check?\n\n25:35.220 --> 25:36.460\nBecause there's like a big 94.\n\n25:36.460 --> 25:38.420\nI was actually really scared that they were going to go,\n\n25:38.420 --> 25:40.180\na 94 come with me.\n\n25:40.180 --> 25:42.860\nAnd yeah, like find out what Canadian waterboarding is.\n\n25:42.860 --> 25:45.220\nMine had a big X and a 35.\n\n25:45.220 --> 25:47.660\nBecause I was going through the thing where you type in,\n\n25:47.660 --> 25:49.420\nyou put little foreign, they scan that in.\n\n25:49.420 --> 25:50.380\nThat's new for me.\n\n25:50.380 --> 25:51.140\nThey scan it in.\n\n25:51.140 --> 25:53.820\nAnd it's like, you didn't say date left Canada.\n\n25:53.820 --> 25:55.260\nAnd I was like, I don't know.\n\n25:55.260 --> 25:58.180\nDate left Canada, and I was like, haven't left Canada.\n\n25:58.180 --> 25:58.900\nJust got to Canada.\n\n25:58.900 --> 25:59.940\nThat happened to me too.\n\n25:59.940 --> 26:01.580\nAnd I was like, OK, I'll say the date.\n\n26:01.580 --> 26:02.500\nI will leave Canada.\n\n26:02.500 --> 26:03.300\nSo I write that down.\n\n26:03.300 --> 26:05.860\nAnd then it goes, sorry, it shoots it back out.\n\n26:05.860 --> 26:06.820\nIt can read.\n\n26:06.820 --> 26:09.180\nAnd it says, you didn't say how much money you're bringing in.\n\n26:09.180 --> 26:10.180\nAnd so I wrote zero.\n\n26:10.180 --> 26:11.780\nAnd he goes, you didn't say how much money.\n\n26:11.780 --> 26:13.580\nSo I wrote a bunch of zeros in there.\n\n26:13.580 --> 26:14.860\nAnd I'm lying through them all.\n\n26:14.860 --> 26:16.780\nAnd then it goes, how many plants do you have?\n\n26:16.780 --> 26:18.980\nI said, I just wrote zero.\n\n26:18.980 --> 26:20.140\nAnd he goes, all right, we're going\n\n26:20.140 --> 26:22.300\nto have to ask you a lot more questions.\n\n26:22.300 --> 26:25.140\nWhy do you have zero plants?\n\n26:25.140 --> 26:26.860\nI mean, those machines are new.\n\n26:26.860 --> 26:29.060\nHe's supposed to bring a gift.\n\n26:29.060 --> 26:31.420\nYou're going to see the Lannisters for God's sake.\n\n26:31.420 --> 26:33.500\nYou're empty handed?\n\n26:33.500 --> 26:36.220\nWhere is your poppy milk?\n\n26:36.220 --> 26:37.300\nMilk of the poppy.\n\n26:37.300 --> 26:38.980\nI've brought the letter a million times to Canada\n\n26:38.980 --> 26:40.700\nwhere you get this letter of invitation that says,\n\n26:40.700 --> 26:43.020\nwhere you're performing, what kind of theater, what the deal\n\n26:43.020 --> 26:44.900\nis, who you're with, all this stuff.\n\n26:44.900 --> 26:45.860\nAnd they never read it.\n\n26:45.860 --> 26:46.540\nThey just look at it.\n\n26:46.540 --> 26:48.460\nYou show them the letter and they go, OK, he has the letter.\n\n26:48.460 --> 26:50.260\nAnd it's a cursory glance of the thing.\n\n26:50.260 --> 26:51.820\nYou can just hand them like a book.\n\n26:51.820 --> 26:53.820\nAnd of course, ISIS could never get a hold of a Just\n\n26:53.820 --> 26:55.940\nfor Last letter.\n\n26:55.940 --> 26:58.980\nIt's just not within their fucking capability.\n\n26:58.980 --> 27:02.020\nWe've got so many other things to think about.\n\n27:02.020 --> 27:05.700\nYeah, we got ISIS to think about.\n\n27:05.700 --> 27:08.940\nRemember, there was a guy in America,\n\n27:08.940 --> 27:12.340\nthere was a mailman that landed on the lawn with letters\n\n27:12.340 --> 27:14.780\nfor Congress to talk about campaign reform.\n\n27:14.780 --> 27:19.180\nIt was like a performance art slash protest slash possible\n\n27:19.180 --> 27:21.540\nmartyrdom because he knew there was a chance they might shoot\n\n27:21.540 --> 27:23.060\nhim out of the sky.\n\n27:23.060 --> 27:24.540\nIt's a guy who made his own helicopter, right?\n\n27:24.540 --> 27:27.580\nHe made like a little lawn chair with a helicopter blade\n\n27:27.580 --> 27:31.060\non it and like he just landed right next to the Congress.\n\n27:31.060 --> 27:32.100\nAnd they took him to jail.\n\n27:32.100 --> 27:33.060\nThey should hire that guy.\n\n27:33.060 --> 27:34.820\nHe makes his own helicopters.\n\n27:34.820 --> 27:36.140\nAnd it was like, OK, great.\n\n27:36.140 --> 27:37.740\nThis is like, OK, campaign reform.\n\n27:37.740 --> 27:39.540\nNow we're going to talk about it a little bit.\n\n27:39.540 --> 27:42.020\nAnd like five minutes later, the top story on CNN\n\n27:42.020 --> 27:46.220\nwas, how many ISIS could have fit on that helicopter?\n\n27:46.220 --> 27:47.140\nWhat if that was an ISIS?\n\n27:47.140 --> 27:49.580\nI think they're so important, people want to kill them.\n\n27:49.580 --> 27:55.020\nThese lawmakers, oh, they're going to come in here and ISIS us.\n\n27:55.020 --> 27:57.580\nThen the country will shut down because there's not\n\n27:57.580 --> 28:00.260\na bunch of fucking jerks banging gavels\n\n28:00.260 --> 28:02.100\nand whatever they do in there.\n\n28:02.100 --> 28:04.740\nAll right, hate government, stupid.\n\n28:04.740 --> 28:08.380\nDid you know that Montreal's government is divided\n\n28:08.380 --> 28:11.940\ninto four quadrants?\n\n28:11.940 --> 28:13.140\nThe press?\n\n28:13.140 --> 28:20.060\nThe judicial, the police, and mass transit.\n\n28:20.060 --> 28:22.420\nAnd they all checked and balances.\n\n28:22.420 --> 28:25.420\nThe way a bill becomes a law, they don't call it a law here.\n\n28:25.420 --> 28:32.460\nThey call it a lul, is that you have to, a judicial has to,\n\n28:32.460 --> 28:33.820\nhave an idea.\n\n28:33.820 --> 28:37.020\nAnd then he gives it to a bus driver.\n\n28:37.020 --> 28:39.820\nIf a majority of the bus drivers,\n\n28:39.820 --> 28:45.100\nthink that it's an OK idea, then they pass that up to the police.\n\n28:45.100 --> 28:48.660\nWho don't carry guns and who simply say thank you.\n\n28:48.660 --> 28:51.500\nAnd then the bus drivers say sorry.\n\n28:51.500 --> 28:52.820\nAnd then they say thank you.\n\n28:52.820 --> 28:53.940\nSorry.\n\n28:53.940 --> 28:57.780\nAnd then after a while, it's a law, but you can break it too.\n\n28:57.780 --> 29:01.060\nAnd they'll just make you a policeman.\n\n29:01.060 --> 29:02.460\nIt's a perfect system.\n\n29:02.460 --> 29:04.460\nYou know how many people died here last year?\n\n29:04.460 --> 29:04.940\nZero.\n\n29:04.940 --> 29:05.460\nWhat?\n\n29:05.460 --> 29:06.780\nYeah, it's like Britain.\n\n29:06.780 --> 29:10.020\nI assume, I never read it.\n\n29:10.020 --> 29:11.020\nHave you seen Brigadoon?\n\n29:11.020 --> 29:12.020\nNo.\n\n29:14.020 --> 29:16.860\nIt's like Westworld, but with no guests.\n\n29:16.860 --> 29:18.860\nBut they're not robots, they just don't die.\n\n29:22.700 --> 29:25.500\nYou know, it's that last time there was a mass shooting in Canada?\n\n29:25.500 --> 29:30.500\nIt was a paintball game.\n\n29:30.500 --> 29:34.020\nThey try not to shoot each other when they play paintball up here.\n\n29:34.020 --> 29:38.020\nThere was an American, he went nuts, he shot everybody.\n\n29:38.020 --> 29:45.020\nAnd their flags were at quarter mass, four, six deacons,\n\n29:45.020 --> 29:48.020\nwhich is what they call a month here.\n\n29:48.020 --> 29:50.020\nDo they have a metric calendar here?\n\n29:50.020 --> 29:51.020\n10 months make a year.\n\n29:51.020 --> 29:52.020\nIsn't that simpler?\n\n29:52.020 --> 29:54.020\nEach month is 10 days.\n\n29:54.020 --> 29:56.020\nMakes sense.\n\n29:56.020 --> 30:01.020\nHow many days in a year?\n\n30:01.020 --> 30:02.020\nA hundred.\n\n30:02.020 --> 30:03.020\nA hundred.\n\n30:03.020 --> 30:06.020\nI was about to say a thousand.\n\n30:06.020 --> 30:11.020\nIt's a simple system.\n\n30:11.020 --> 30:17.020\nOkay, Spencer, can you come share a mic so you can read Cody's lines in this text conversation?\n\n30:17.020 --> 30:20.020\nYeah, so I come up there, I'll use your mic.\n\n30:20.020 --> 30:22.020\nOkay, great.\n\n30:22.020 --> 30:32.020\nYeah, okay, so Thursday, 9.03 p.m., you're gray, so you're Cody.\n\n30:32.020 --> 30:35.020\nOkay, I might get to your house a little early if that's okay,\n\n30:35.020 --> 30:38.020\nso Nicole can drive me and I don't have to Uber.\n\n30:38.020 --> 30:40.020\nAre you on your way?\n\n30:40.020 --> 30:42.020\nNot yet.\n\n30:42.020 --> 30:45.020\nNicole was gonna drive me in about five to ten minutes,\n\n30:45.020 --> 30:48.020\nbut I can change that plan if needed.\n\n30:48.020 --> 30:59.020\nIt's okay, but it necessitates me warning you about one thing.\n\n30:59.020 --> 31:03.020\nIt's not sex doll related.\n\n31:03.020 --> 31:06.020\nOkay, I can wait if it makes you uncomfortable.\n\n31:06.020 --> 31:08.020\nThat's great, that's awesome.\n\n31:08.020 --> 31:10.020\nI can just Uber when you're ready.\n\n31:10.020 --> 31:12.020\nThat's no big deal.\n\n31:12.020 --> 31:17.020\nI guess I'd rather just tell you now because otherwise you'll have to make up guesses in your head.\n\n31:17.020 --> 31:19.020\nThat was a bad move, Dan.\n\n31:19.020 --> 31:21.020\nShe just went with it.\n\n31:21.020 --> 31:23.020\nThat's true.\n\n31:23.020 --> 31:31.020\nThe new sheets came and Sophia put them on the bed on Tuesday,\n\n31:31.020 --> 31:35.020\nand they're gray.\n\n31:35.020 --> 31:38.020\nAt risk.\n\n31:38.020 --> 31:44.020\nAnd then last night I accidentally kind of shit on them.\n\n31:44.020 --> 31:50.020\nHa ha ha! Oh, my.\n\n31:50.020 --> 31:55.020\nAnd I didn't see until this morning. God.\n\n31:55.020 --> 31:58.020\nThere's a visible stain.\n\n31:58.020 --> 32:00.020\nSo what's our plan for sleeping tonight?\n\n32:00.020 --> 32:02.020\nAre the old sheets still somewhere?\n\n32:02.020 --> 32:04.020\nBy the way, I'm not judging you, baby.\n\n32:04.020 --> 32:06.020\nJust trying to solve the problem solved for later.\n\n32:06.020 --> 32:08.020\nIt's also gray.\n\n32:08.020 --> 32:10.020\nWell, it's not...\n\n32:10.020 --> 32:12.020\nI just need to hit it with some cleaner.\n\n32:12.020 --> 32:17.020\nYou never had to know, but now I had to tell you because you're getting there before me\n\n32:17.020 --> 32:20.020\nand you were going to see this new sheets and want to look at them\n\n32:20.020 --> 32:22.020\nand then you were going to see this stain.\n\n32:22.020 --> 32:24.020\nHa ha ha! Okay.\n\n32:24.020 --> 32:27.020\nWell, I don't think I'm going to get there before you anyway now\n\n32:27.020 --> 32:30.020\nbecause I released Nicole when you said you had to tell me something.\n\n32:30.020 --> 32:32.020\nSo I'll just meet you there at seven.\n\n32:32.020 --> 32:36.020\nErgo.

I didn't know what it was going to be and I didn't want her to keep you...\n\n32:42.020 --> 32:45.020\nand I didn't want to keep her waiting, so I just told her to go on.\n\n32:45.020 --> 32:47.020\nWell, now you know.\n\n32:47.020 --> 32:49.020\nI shit on the new sheets you picked out.\n\n32:49.020 --> 32:52.020\nHa ha.

38:17.020\nWell, I think he'd be pretty grateful that I didn't bug him.\n\n38:17.020 --> 38:19.020\nMaybe he didn't just get whisked out of the airport.\n\n38:19.020 --> 38:24.020\nMaybe he ran because he was so ashamed.\n\n38:24.020 --> 38:26.020\nHe probably has a lot of stuff going on, I think.\n\n38:26.020 --> 38:27.020\nWhat do you have to do?\n\n38:27.020 --> 38:28.020\nAt what point is your career so awesome\n\n38:28.020 --> 38:30.020\nthat you get Seth Rogen airport status?\n\n38:30.020 --> 38:31.020\nYou have to be Seth Rogen.\n\n38:31.020 --> 38:34.020\nHe's been worth like a billion dollars.\n\n38:34.020 --> 38:37.020\nWhat's the low end of that thing?\n\n38:37.020 --> 38:38.020\nWhat's the threshold you have?\n\n38:38.020 --> 38:39.020\nOh, yeah.\n\n38:39.020 --> 38:40.020\nI don't know.\n\n38:40.020 --> 38:41.020\nIt's probably like DL Hugley or something.\n\n38:41.020 --> 38:42.020\nYeah, yeah.\n\n38:42.020 --> 38:43.020\nThat's all I was going to say.\n\n38:43.020 --> 38:45.020\nI think probably there's like a threshold\n\n38:45.020 --> 38:47.020\nyou cross right around Hugley level.\n\n38:47.020 --> 38:48.020\nYeah.\n\n38:48.020 --> 38:49.020\nYeah.\n\n38:49.020 --> 38:51.020\nWhere like maybe like an old person comes\n\n38:51.020 --> 38:53.020\nand meets you at the gate and kind of takes you\n\n38:53.020 --> 38:56.020\nto like a slightly shorter taxi line.\n\n38:56.020 --> 38:59.020\nDid I ever tell Harmontown how I was on the plane\n\n38:59.020 --> 39:01.020\nwith George Takei, Sulu from Star Trek?\n\n39:01.020 --> 39:02.020\nDid I ever tell him?\n\n39:02.020 --> 39:03.020\nYeah.\n\n39:03.020 --> 39:04.020\nOh my.\n\n39:04.020 --> 39:05.020\nYeah.\n\n39:05.020 --> 39:06.020\nYou never feel safer in your life\n\n39:06.020 --> 39:08.020\nwhen you got Sulu on the plane?\n\n39:08.020 --> 39:11.020\nI had to stop following him on Twitter\n\n39:11.020 --> 39:13.020\nbecause he has like a little cottage industry\n\n39:13.020 --> 39:15.020\nof like retweeting stuff and then you click.\n\n39:15.020 --> 39:17.020\nIt's all bad jokes too.\n\n39:17.020 --> 39:18.020\nIt's not great.\n\n39:18.020 --> 39:20.020\nAn ad supported like shit fills your screen\n\n39:20.020 --> 39:22.020\nand like oh my.\n\n39:22.020 --> 39:26.020\nIsn't he mad about the gay Sulu?\n\n39:26.020 --> 39:28.020\nLike the openly gay Sulu in that movie?\n\n39:28.020 --> 39:30.020\nWasn't he like mad about it?\n\n39:30.020 --> 39:31.020\nI don't know even what you're talking about.\n\n39:31.020 --> 39:33.020\nOh, there's a new Star Trek movie.\n\n39:33.020 --> 39:35.020\nThere's a new Sulu.\n\n39:35.020 --> 39:38.020\nHe's openly gay in the character.\n\n39:38.020 --> 39:39.020\nAnd he doesn't like it?\n\n39:39.020 --> 39:41.020\nI don't think George Takei likes it.\n\n39:41.020 --> 39:42.020\nI guess I could understand that\n\n39:42.020 --> 39:44.020\nbecause he'd be going well, I'm an actor.\n\n39:44.020 --> 39:45.020\nI played a character.\n\n39:45.020 --> 39:47.020\nLike why are you making him gay?\n\n39:47.020 --> 39:50.020\nJust like a nod to my sexuality as a real person?\n\n39:50.020 --> 39:51.020\nYeah.\n\n39:51.020 --> 39:52.020\nI guess I kind of get that.\n\n39:52.020 --> 39:53.020\nBut on the other hand,\n\n39:53.020 --> 39:54.020\nI can understand them thinking\n\n39:54.020 --> 39:56.020\nhe's going to be stoked about this\n\n39:56.020 --> 39:58.020\nbecause he had to be in the closet back then\n\n39:58.020 --> 40:00.020\nwhile he was like a huge star\n\n40:00.020 --> 40:02.020\nand that was like probably really unfair and painful.\n\n40:02.020 --> 40:03.020\nSo in their minds,\n\n40:03.020 --> 40:05.020\nthey're probably like this is sort of\n\n40:05.020 --> 40:07.020\na little bit of a restitution, you know?\n\n40:07.020 --> 40:09.020\nIt's like a doffing of the cap,\n\n40:09.020 --> 40:10.020\nan apology almost.\n\n40:10.020 --> 40:12.020\nSo I can understand how there's two heroes\n\n40:12.020 --> 40:14.020\nin that story and they're both each other's villains.\n\n40:14.020 --> 40:15.020\nIsn't that something?\n\n40:15.020 --> 40:16.020\nWell, that's just the world, man.\n\n40:16.020 --> 40:18.020\nThat's the world we live in.\n\n40:18.020 --> 40:20.020\nWhat if dichotomy was too limited\n\n40:20.020 --> 40:21.020\nfor the human experience?\n\n40:21.020 --> 40:23.020\nWhat if everything happened in a continuum\n\n40:23.020 --> 40:25.020\nthat ate itself, you know?\n\n40:25.020 --> 40:28.020\nLike what if you shouldn't have to choose\n\n40:28.020 --> 40:31.020\nbetween I heard a guy on public radio,\n\n40:31.020 --> 40:34.020\nsome Democrat guy that was like pumping people up\n\n40:34.020 --> 40:37.020\nfor Hillary Clinton and he was like\n\n40:37.020 --> 40:39.020\nin between applause swells.\n\n40:39.020 --> 40:41.020\nHe was like, I don't know who it was\n\n40:41.020 --> 40:42.020\nbecause it was radio.\n\n40:42.020 --> 40:43.020\nI couldn't see him in him.\n\n40:43.020 --> 40:45.020\nBut he was like,\n\n40:45.020 --> 40:49.020\nnow I know our candidate isn't perfect.\n\n40:49.020 --> 40:50.020\nYeah.\n\n40:50.020 --> 40:53.020\nBut what do you say?\n\n40:53.020 --> 40:56.020\nBut it's about not voting for Trump,\n\n40:56.020 --> 40:57.020\nbasically is what he said.\n\n40:57.020 --> 40:58.020\nAnd it was like,\n\n40:58.020 --> 41:00.020\nthat's the fucking scam in a nutshell.\n\n41:00.020 --> 41:02.020\nIt's just fucking sucks.\n\n41:02.020 --> 41:04.020\nAnd it's really not limited to America.\n\n41:04.020 --> 41:06.020\nIt's just magnified there.\n\n41:06.020 --> 41:10.020\nIt's such a scam that we've turned elections\n\n41:10.020 --> 41:13.020\ninto how much you hate someone else.\n\n41:13.020 --> 41:16.020\nAnd so that's just an easy way to get nothing done\n\n41:16.020 --> 41:17.020\nbecause everyone's like,\n\n41:17.020 --> 41:19.020\noh, don't vote for that other person.\n\n41:19.020 --> 41:21.020\nThere's always someone worse to vote for.\n\n41:21.020 --> 41:23.020\nIn fact, there's only one person\n\n41:23.020 --> 41:25.020\nthat's worse or better to vote for.\n\n41:25.020 --> 41:26.020\nAnd it's like, you have to choose.\n\n41:26.020 --> 41:30.020\nBut it's a dumb crap if I can want to smash my brains\n\n41:30.020 --> 41:31.020\nin with a hammer.\n\n41:31.020 --> 41:34.020\nI can only threaten suicide now verbally\n\n41:34.020 --> 41:36.020\nbecause it's probably not legal to say\n\n41:36.020 --> 41:38.020\nyou want to kill someone else.\n\n41:38.020 --> 41:39.020\nIt would be taken seriously\n\n41:39.020 --> 41:43.020\nbecause there's a lot of people that deserve to die.\n\n41:43.020 --> 41:45.020\nIt wouldn't be taken as a joke\n\n41:45.020 --> 41:46.020\nbecause that's a threat\n\n41:46.020 --> 41:48.020\nbecause I would want to kill that person too\n\n41:48.020 --> 41:50.020\nbut you're not allowed to say it for that reason.\n\n41:50.020 --> 41:53.020\nI just want to kill so many people.\n\n41:53.020 --> 41:57.020\nI mean, are there people like,\n\n41:57.020 --> 41:59.020\nI would imagine a lot of you like,\n\n41:59.020 --> 42:01.020\nyou're Justin Trudeau, right?\n\n42:01.020 --> 42:02.020\nLike, are people like him?\n\n42:02.020 --> 42:04.020\nYeah.\n\n42:04.020 --> 42:08.020\nHe's so charming and so open-minded and sexy\n\n42:08.020 --> 42:09.020\nand kind of adorable.\n\n42:09.020 --> 42:11.020\nAnd he created Dunesbury.\n\n42:11.020 --> 42:12.020\nYeah.\n\n42:12.020 --> 42:15.020\nSo he's very political.\n\n42:15.020 --> 42:17.020\nWe know that going in.\n\n42:17.020 --> 42:18.020\nHe knows about the issues\n\n42:18.020 --> 42:21.020\nbecause he made a political cartoon for many decades.\n\n42:21.020 --> 42:23.020\nDunesbury.\n\n42:23.020 --> 42:25.020\nIs it possible to still be a government-hating anarchist\n\n42:25.020 --> 42:26.020\nwhen you're prime minister?\n\n42:26.020 --> 42:28.020\nIs that charming and sexy?\n\n42:28.020 --> 42:29.020\nYeah.\n\n42:29.020 --> 42:30.020\nGood.\n\n42:30.020 --> 42:31.020\nThat's what I want to hear.\n\n42:31.020 --> 42:32.020\nProbably all the more so\n\n42:32.020 --> 42:33.020\nbecause there's probably an effective level\n\n42:33.020 --> 42:35.020\nof lower-level government here\n\n42:35.020 --> 42:36.020\nthat's probably very, you know,\n\n42:36.020 --> 42:38.020\nwhether or not it's better than most or not,\n\n42:38.020 --> 42:40.020\nbut it's probably maybe the issues\n\n42:40.020 --> 42:42.020\nthey have to deal with here are less like,\n\n42:42.020 --> 42:44.020\nthere's a lunatic in the White House.\n\n42:44.020 --> 42:46.020\nHe's going to kill us all.\n\n42:46.020 --> 42:48.020\nAnd more just like,\n\n42:48.020 --> 42:50.020\nyeah, but this is bullshit and inefficient\n\n42:50.020 --> 42:52.020\nand it kind of cheats these people out of this or that.\n\n42:52.020 --> 42:53.020\nAnd so it's probably,\n\n42:53.020 --> 42:54.020\nyou could probably still hate the government\n\n42:54.020 --> 42:57.020\neven if you have a good, good prime minister.\n\n42:57.020 --> 42:58.020\nYeah.\n\n42:58.020 --> 42:59.020\nYeah.\n\n42:59.020 --> 43:00.020\nGood.\n\n43:00.020 --> 43:01.020\nThis is hate government.\n\n43:01.020 --> 43:02.020\nNot the government.\n\n43:02.020 --> 43:03.020\nYou can just hate government.\n\n43:03.020 --> 43:04.020\nYeah.\n\n43:04.020 --> 43:05.020\nWho wants to be governed?\n\n43:05.020 --> 43:06.020\nWhy would they have invented government\n\n43:06.020 --> 43:08.020\nif anyone liked being governed?\n\n43:08.020 --> 43:09.020\nNo one's going to ask for it to happen.\n\n43:09.020 --> 43:10.020\nThey had to make it up.\n\n43:10.020 --> 43:12.020\nLike, you need to be governed.\n\n43:12.020 --> 43:13.020\nWell, oh, good.\n\n43:13.020 --> 43:14.020\nIt's a good thing you told me\n\n43:14.020 --> 43:15.020\nbecause I never would have fucking come up\n\n43:15.020 --> 43:17.020\nwith that idea on my own.\n\n43:17.020 --> 43:19.020\nSomeone telling me what to do.\n\n43:19.020 --> 43:21.020\nIt's not something I'd come up with.\n\n43:21.020 --> 43:24.020\nI'd rather hang out.\n\n43:24.020 --> 43:25.020\nAnd then I poop,\n\n43:25.020 --> 43:27.020\nand I'm like, who's going to move that\n\n43:27.020 --> 43:29.020\nsomewhere where it stinks less?\n\n43:29.020 --> 43:30.020\nWe need to, someone governs someone\n\n43:30.020 --> 43:32.020\nand get that out of here.\n\n43:32.020 --> 43:34.020\nDon't govern me.\n\n43:34.020 --> 43:37.020\nI think King Geraldo's doing a pretty bang-up job, though.\n\n43:37.020 --> 43:39.020\nHe found Al Capone's vault.\n\n43:39.020 --> 43:43.020\nI mean, there was nothing in it, but...\n\n43:43.020 --> 43:46.020\nWell, I've run out of lack of material.\n\n43:46.020 --> 43:47.020\nIs there...\n\n43:47.020 --> 43:49.020\nI never had any.\n\n43:49.020 --> 43:51.020\nWhatever I didn't have, I've run out of.\n\n43:51.020 --> 43:54.020\nIs there an epilogue to the sheets?\n\n43:54.020 --> 43:55.020\nYou got one first?\n\n43:55.020 --> 43:58.020\nI got home and I found some pet spray,\n\n43:58.020 --> 44:00.020\nlike some fur carpets.\n\n44:00.020 --> 44:04.020\nI tried, you know, I...\n\n44:04.020 --> 44:06.020\nFor somebody who poops himself as often as you,\n\n44:06.020 --> 44:09.020\nyou should really have some stain stuff.\n\n44:09.020 --> 44:11.020\nYeah, some nature's miracle.\n\n44:11.020 --> 44:15.020\nSo I got the old sheets back out.\n\n44:15.020 --> 44:17.020\nDid the new sheets come out of the laundry?\n\n44:17.020 --> 44:19.020\nI didn't poop on them, no.\n\n44:19.020 --> 44:21.020\nNo, I'm saying the new ones.\n\n44:21.020 --> 44:23.020\nDid they come out all right, or do we know?\n\n44:23.020 --> 44:26.020\nOh, I don't know. They teed up for the laundry.\n\n44:26.020 --> 44:28.020\nSo they're just right now how I'm just chilling\n\n44:28.020 --> 44:30.020\nin the laundry basket?\n\n44:30.020 --> 44:32.020\nThey're not covered in shit.\n\n44:32.020 --> 44:35.020\nIt's not like the Manson murders,\n\n44:35.020 --> 44:37.020\nbut everything's brown instead of red.\n\n44:37.020 --> 44:42.020\nIt's a little skid mark, okay?\n\n44:42.020 --> 44:44.020\nIt's like a little...\n\n44:44.020 --> 44:47.020\nI coughed.\n\n44:47.020 --> 44:51.020\nI coughed and I had been drinking soylent a lot.\n\n44:51.020 --> 44:53.020\nIs my girlfriend still out there?\n\n44:53.020 --> 44:55.020\nDid she just leave?\n\n44:55.020 --> 44:57.020\nShe's back in Los Angeles.\n\n44:57.020 --> 44:59.020\nShe did leave.\n\n44:59.020 --> 45:01.020\nMaybe she had to go poop.\n\n45:01.020 --> 45:04.020\nI go to the back of the room and there's just a note.\n\n45:04.020 --> 45:06.020\nA letter.\n\n45:06.020 --> 45:09.020\nJust for laughs, a letterhead that I can use\n\n45:09.020 --> 45:11.020\nto get back into America.\n\n45:11.020 --> 45:14.020\nYou don't need that to get back though, right?\n\n45:14.020 --> 45:18.020\nUsually there's just a bunch of ATM-style machines, right?\n\n45:18.020 --> 45:20.020\nWhen you're coming back.\n\n45:20.020 --> 45:23.020\nI can't remember now.\n\n45:23.020 --> 45:25.020\nI've only dealt with these big ATM...\n\n45:25.020 --> 45:27.020\nThat's the American way.\n\n45:27.020 --> 45:31.020\nDon't use free paper and pens that you borrow from people.\n\n45:31.020 --> 45:35.020\nBuy 18, $10,000 machines\n\n45:35.020 --> 45:38.020\nand just put them in a row and let them sort it out.\n\n45:38.020 --> 45:41.020\nEvery three months they'll become obsolete\n\n45:41.020 --> 45:44.020\nand you'll have a no-bid contract with whoever makes those machines.\n\n45:44.020 --> 45:46.020\nThe American way.\n\n45:46.020 --> 45:50.020\nLet that shit trickle down to Quebec.\n\n45:50.020 --> 45:53.020\nFucking global hegemony.\n\n45:53.020 --> 45:56.020\nIf you guys are so smart, why aren't you rich?\n\n45:56.020 --> 45:58.020\nWhy don't you have missiles?\n\n45:58.020 --> 46:00.020\nThat's smart. Have a big missile.\n\n46:00.020 --> 46:04.020\nWhat are your top four favorite provinces in Canada?\n\n46:04.020 --> 46:09.020\nI mean, I'm going to eliminate Quebec because we're in Quebec.\n\n46:09.020 --> 46:15.020\nI think, you know, in my heart...\n\n46:15.020 --> 46:19.020\nI'm a sesquipidutra mom.\n\n46:19.020 --> 46:21.020\nYou've got to catch them all.\n\n46:21.020 --> 46:23.020\nYeah.\n\n46:23.020 --> 46:26.020\nBut, you know, everybody always says,\n\n46:26.020 --> 46:28.020\nAtamata Pia.\n\n46:28.020 --> 46:31.020\nHe's so close actually. Are you doing this on purpose?\n\n46:31.020 --> 46:36.020\nBut I think, and that's two, and I got it, nailed it.\n\n46:36.020 --> 46:39.020\nSo I'll give you Saskatchewan and Ottawa.\n\n46:39.020 --> 46:47.020\nAnd north of that is Peabody and Helmsman.\n\n46:47.020 --> 46:49.020\nWichita.\n\n46:49.020 --> 46:52.020\nI don't know, man. It's a big thing.\n\n46:52.020 --> 46:54.020\nIt's on all of our maps.\n\n46:54.020 --> 46:57.020\nIt's just like a big square above the world.\n\n46:57.020 --> 46:59.020\nAnd then it's subdivided into squares.\n\n46:59.020 --> 47:01.020\nAnd they all have these names.\n\n47:01.020 --> 47:05.020\nWhy does Canada always pink on the maps?\n\n47:05.020 --> 47:07.020\nDon't let them panic you.\n\n47:07.020 --> 47:09.020\nIt's not always pink on the maps.\n\n47:09.020 --> 47:11.020\nIt's a weird, arbitrary thing for him to say.\n\n47:11.020 --> 47:13.020\nIt's usually white because it's like,\n\n47:13.020 --> 47:15.020\nOh, it's the North Pole. There's penguins up there.\n\n47:15.020 --> 47:20.020\nThere's beacons and penguins and no one can invade us.\n\n47:20.020 --> 47:22.020\nThat's what's important.\n\n47:22.020 --> 47:25.020\nThe penguins are on the bottom of Earth.\n\n47:25.020 --> 47:28.020\nYou guys don't have any oil or fresh water, do you?\n\n47:28.020 --> 47:31.020\nI'm asking for a friend.\n\n47:31.020 --> 47:33.020\nThis will not come back to bite you.\n\n47:33.020 --> 47:36.020\nJust be honest, how much oil and fresh water do you have?\n\n47:36.020 --> 47:38.020\nNo.\n\n47:38.020 --> 47:40.020\nSell it all for a few dollars.\n\n47:40.020 --> 47:44.020\nAre you guys having bad times economically too?\n\n47:44.020 --> 47:46.020\nUp here?\n\n47:46.020 --> 47:48.020\nNo, not really?\n\n47:48.020 --> 47:50.020\nYes, some said no, some said kind of.\n\n47:50.020 --> 47:53.020\nWe got the full spectrum on that one.\n\n47:53.020 --> 47:55.020\nI've never...\n\n47:55.020 --> 47:58.020\nIt's my fault or America's fault.\n\n47:58.020 --> 48:02.020\nBut I'm sure I'm 1,250 millionth to blame if it's...\n\n48:02.020 --> 48:04.020\nIs it the subprime mortgage thing?\n\n48:04.020 --> 48:06.020\nIs it that thing?\n\n48:06.020 --> 48:09.020\nOkay, that didn't affect you guys.\n\n48:09.020 --> 48:11.020\nDidn't I put grease out of business?\n\n48:11.020 --> 48:14.020\nNow there's swastikas painted everywhere in grease.\n\n48:14.020 --> 48:16.020\nThere are other banks closed.\n\n48:16.020 --> 48:20.020\nSomeone talked them into investing in a bunch of American real estate or something.\n\n48:20.020 --> 48:23.020\nI don't know from nothing.\n\n48:23.020 --> 48:26.020\nThat's vodka, don't worry.\n\n48:26.020 --> 48:28.020\nIt's not spit.\n\n48:28.020 --> 48:30.020\nAlright, well let's meet some Montralians.\n\n48:30.020 --> 48:32.020\nLet's do it.\n\n48:32.020 --> 48:34.020\nOkay, who here...\n\n48:34.020 --> 48:36.020\nLet's see.\n\n48:36.020 --> 48:38.020\nYou guys are so nice and quiet and quiet.\n\n48:38.020 --> 48:40.020\nThat's so nice.\n\n48:40.020 --> 48:43.020\nIf this was Chicago and I said let's meet some people, there'd just be...\n\n48:43.020 --> 48:45.020\nWho here has a birthday in October\n\n48:45.020 --> 48:48.020\nand three people would run up on stage that didn't hear that\n\n48:48.020 --> 48:51.020\nand just start confessing to us about their pornography?\n\n48:51.020 --> 48:54.020\nSomebody would get punched.\n\n48:54.020 --> 48:56.020\nSo thank you.\n\n48:56.020 --> 48:58.020\nThank you in advance for that.\n\n48:58.020 --> 49:00.020\nBut then when you get up here, don't be as nice\n\n49:00.020 --> 49:02.020\nbecause that won't be entertaining.\n\n49:02.020 --> 49:05.020\nHave flaws and express them.\n\n49:05.020 --> 49:07.020\nWho here...\n\n49:07.020 --> 49:09.020\nLet's see.\n\n49:09.020 --> 49:11.020\nWho here is an American?\n\n49:11.020 --> 49:13.020\nLet's bring up...\n\n49:13.020 --> 49:16.020\nWell, let's just bring up somebody that's having a hard time of it\n\n49:16.020 --> 49:18.020\nfor some reason in particular.\n\n49:18.020 --> 49:22.020\nYou know, it's having a pretty bad day that made it here in spite of it.\n\n49:22.020 --> 49:26.020\nOkay, we got Seth Rogen right in the middle here.\n\n49:26.020 --> 49:28.020\nQuebecois, Seth Rogen, everybody.\n\n49:28.020 --> 49:30.020\nLet's hear it

I can play music\n\n49:45.020 --> 49:47.020\nfrom time to time and it keeps going back down.\n\n49:47.020 --> 49:48.020\nSir.\n\n49:48.020 --> 49:49.020\nThank you.\n\n49:49.020 --> 49:50.020\nWhat's your name, sir?\n\n49:50.020 --> 49:51.020\nJ.P.\n\n49:51.020 --> 49:53.020\nHey, J.P., would you just stand for Jean-Paul?\n\n49:53.020 --> 49:54.020\nJean-Philippe.\n\n49:54.020 --> 49:55.020\nJean-Philippe.\n\n49:55.020 --> 49:56.020\nYes.\n\n49:56.020 --> 49:57.020\nAlright.\n\n49:57.020 --> 49:58.020\nSexy.\n\n49:58.020 --> 50:00.020\nYou're like an undersea explorer.\n\n50:00.020 --> 50:01.020\nBienvenue.\n\n50:01.020 --> 50:02.020\nMerci.\n\n50:02.020 --> 50:04.020\nAre you Montreal native?\n\n50:04.020 --> 50:06.020\nI was born in Montreal but I'm from...\n\n50:06.020 --> 50:07.020\nUse your mic.\n\n50:07.020 --> 50:09.020\nI'm born in Montreal but I'm from Ottawa.\n\n50:09.020 --> 50:10.020\nOttawa.\n\n50:10.020 --> 50:12.020\nOh, my favorite province.\n\n50:12.020 --> 50:14.020\nOttawa's lovely.\n\n50:14.020 --> 50:17.020\nI was there for a couple of days, had a lovely time.\n\n50:17.020 --> 50:18.020\nYes?\n\n50:18.020 --> 50:23.020\nJean-Philippe, would you like a cocktail with a bunch of touched ice?\n\n50:23.020 --> 50:24.020\nSure.\n\n50:24.020 --> 50:25.020\nOkay.\n\n50:25.020 --> 50:26.020\nThanks.\n\n50:26.020 --> 50:29.020\nI have vodka and touched ice.\n\n50:29.020 --> 50:31.020\nThere's no cups, huh?\n\n50:31.020 --> 50:32.020\nOh, there is one.\n\n50:32.020 --> 50:34.020\nIt's kind of just crushed.\n\n50:34.020 --> 50:36.020\nIt's not cubed, so it's...\n\n50:36.020 --> 50:39.020\nSo you transferred it in from Ottawa to be here for the festival?\n\n50:39.020 --> 50:41.020\nYes, just for the show.\n\n50:41.020 --> 50:42.020\nJust for us?\n\n50:42.020 --> 50:43.020\nYeah.\n\n50:43.020 --> 50:45.020\nAre we living up to your standards?\n\n50:45.020 --> 50:46.020\nOf course.\n\n50:46.020 --> 50:47.020\nAnd you are on stage.\n\n50:47.020 --> 50:48.020\nFantastic.\n\n50:48.020 --> 50:49.020\nYes.\n\n50:49.020 --> 50:53.020\nWhat's going on that has made you blue, JP?\n\n50:53.020 --> 50:55.020\nIn March, my girlfriend passed away.\n\n50:55.020 --> 50:56.020\nOh, here.\n\n50:56.020 --> 50:58.020\nThere you go.\n\n50:58.020 --> 51:03.020\nFor those of you listening in audio, they laughed because they handed him a drink.\n\n51:03.020 --> 51:05.020\nHe didn't give him a hug.\n\n51:05.020 --> 51:07.020\nIt's going to be the weirdest reaction they've had.\n\n51:07.020 --> 51:09.020\nMy girlfriend passed away.\n\n51:09.020 --> 51:13.020\nOh.\n\n51:13.020 --> 51:14.020\nI'm so...\n\n51:14.020 --> 51:16.020\nFor Dan, vodka is like a hug.\n\n51:16.020 --> 51:17.020\nYes.\n\n51:17.020 --> 51:18.020\nHow did...\n\n51:18.020 --> 51:19.020\nHow long ago?\n\n51:19.020 --> 51:20.020\nI'm sorry, I didn't get...\n\n51:20.020 --> 51:21.020\nIn March.\n\n51:21.020 --> 51:22.020\nOkay.\n\n51:22.020 --> 51:25.020\nAnd did we ask what caused?\n\n51:25.020 --> 51:28.020\nPulmonary embolism caused by ambiotic fluid.\n\n51:28.020 --> 51:29.020\nOh, Jesus.\n\n51:29.020 --> 51:30.020\nSo it was no warning at all.\n\n51:30.020 --> 51:32.020\nShe was pregnant.\n\n51:32.020 --> 51:33.020\nOh.\n\n51:33.020 --> 51:34.020\nAll right.\n\n51:34.020 --> 51:37.020\nGood night, folks.\n\n51:37.020 --> 51:40.020\nJust for tears festival.\n\n51:40.020 --> 51:41.020\nHoly smoke.\n\n51:41.020 --> 51:42.020\nYeah.\n\n51:42.020 --> 51:43.020\nHow old was she?\n\n51:43.020 --> 51:44.020\n32.\n\n51:44.020 --> 51:45.020\nAnd so that just came out of the...\n\n51:45.020 --> 51:46.020\nOut of nowhere.\n\n51:46.020 --> 51:47.020\nSo you're...\n\n51:47.020 --> 51:52.020\nYou're as put together about this and able to share this without a crack in the veneer\n\n51:52.020 --> 51:53.020\nbecause it's just...\n\n51:53.020 --> 51:54.020\nIt's absolutely necessary.\n\n51:54.020 --> 51:56.020\nYou had to deal with it and you're just...\n\n51:56.020 --> 51:58.020\nYou're a brick wall right now.\n\n51:58.020 --> 51:59.020\nTry my best.\n\n51:59.020 --> 52:00.020\nYeah.\n\n52:00.020 --> 52:02.020\nAnd so what happens...\n\n52:02.020 --> 52:06.020\nAfter that happens, like in terms of like, do you keep to yourself?\n\n52:06.020 --> 52:10.020\nEveryone's like flooding you with emails and phone calls and things.\n\n52:10.020 --> 52:11.020\nDo you want to be alone?\n\n52:11.020 --> 52:12.020\nIt's more or less.\n\n52:12.020 --> 52:16.020\nI think what happens is that I immediately afterwards you get like sort of...\n\n52:16.020 --> 52:19.020\nIt's like a tsunami.\n\n52:19.020 --> 52:20.020\nIt just hits you.\n\n52:20.020 --> 52:21.020\nYou have like no repair.\n\n52:21.020 --> 52:23.020\nLike you have no idea what's going on.\n\n52:23.020 --> 52:25.020\nYou're constantly surrounded by people.\n\n52:25.020 --> 52:28.020\nAnd then after one point, like everybody's gone.\n\n52:28.020 --> 52:32.020\nLike you have your family, you have your close friends, but then you sort of realize sort\n\n52:32.020 --> 52:35.020\nof the extent of the damage.\n\n52:35.020 --> 52:38.020\nMeaning that you say...\n\n52:38.020 --> 52:42.020\nThe tsunami is referring to a bunch of people flooding you with condolences and...\n\n52:42.020 --> 52:45.020\nThe condolences and also the fact like she passed away.\n\n52:45.020 --> 52:46.020\nLike it comes out of nowhere.\n\n52:46.020 --> 52:48.020\nLike it sort of just hits you.\n\n52:48.020 --> 52:54.020\nAnd it's probably, I would imagine, it's probably timed right so that just when you might actually\n\n52:54.020 --> 53:03.020\nneed some like sympathy, it's probably timed just after everyone is kind of like,\n\n53:03.020 --> 53:05.020\nOkay, I did my part.\n\n53:05.020 --> 53:06.020\nYeah, pretty much.\n\n53:06.020 --> 53:07.020\nThat's pretty much.\n\n53:07.020 --> 53:11.020\nYou awaken to this tragedy after your body has protected you through numbness and stuff.\n\n53:11.020 --> 53:16.020\nAnd you regain sensitivity and then you're largely alone.\n\n53:16.020 --> 53:19.020\nAnd as you said, you're surveying the damage.\n\n53:19.020 --> 53:21.020\nLike what is...\n\n53:21.020 --> 53:26.020\nGive us a detail, not about the event.\n\n53:26.020 --> 53:28.020\nI think it's too ghoulish to...\n\n53:28.020 --> 53:33.020\nBut about the loss, about afterword.\n\n53:33.020 --> 53:38.020\nLike I don't know, paperwork or like what is...\n\n53:38.020 --> 53:52.020\nWhen you're married and then you lose your partner, like what is the worst like non-emotional inconvenience?\n\n53:52.020 --> 53:54.020\nI think pretty much the paperwork is...\n\n53:54.020 --> 53:55.020\nYou have so much paperwork to fill up.\n\n53:55.020 --> 53:56.020\nIt's amazing.\n\n53:56.020 --> 54:02.020\nThe insurance for the hospital and everything, everything you have to deal with.\n\n54:02.020 --> 54:05.020\nIt's like, it's a non-stop barrage of paperwork.\n\n54:05.020 --> 54:08.020\nAnd I snap a few times that people on the phone won't have to fill up and they're like,\n\n54:08.020 --> 54:10.020\nOh yeah, the doctor needs to fill that stop on.\n\n54:10.020 --> 54:15.020\nI just call them up and like, motherfucker, just leave me be for just five minutes alone.\n\n54:15.020 --> 54:18.020\nYeah, that was just about to ask that before you said it.\n\n54:18.020 --> 54:25.020\nLike you must several times a day or a week, like you must just explode into a righteous outrage.\n\n54:25.020 --> 54:28.020\nBecause you're talking to someone that's just like...\n\n54:28.020 --> 54:34.020\nOh, you have to fill out a Z stroke 9-2 and they're not even...\n\n54:34.020 --> 54:39.020\nYou have to remind them why this is happening and what's going on.\n\n54:39.020 --> 54:44.020\nOh yeah, a few times you have to call like, for example, like, I don't know,\n\n54:44.020 --> 54:49.020\nlike her phone company and they're like, tell them like, we have to cancel her contract.\n\n54:49.020 --> 54:50.020\nAnd they're like, Oh, what's the reason?\n\n54:50.020 --> 54:56.020\nAnd it's like, well, she passed away and like you just hear their enthusiasm just drop.\n\n54:56.020 --> 55:01.020\nSort of like in the room way and when I announce what happened, like the same thing, like...\n\n55:01.020 --> 55:05.020\nWell, it sort of feel bad that like you invite somebody, oh, here it's not feeling well.\n\n55:05.020 --> 55:08.020\nEnthusiasm dropping is a negative way of putting it.\n\n55:08.020 --> 55:15.020\nI think it's them like opening up to, you know, they're like, Oh, I need to be on alert.\n\n55:15.020 --> 55:17.020\nI'm not going to trample all around us.\n\n55:17.020 --> 55:20.020\nI'm going to like be careful now and like...\n\n55:20.020 --> 55:22.020\nHow long did you know her?\n\n55:22.020 --> 55:23.020\n10 years.\n\n55:23.020 --> 55:24.020\nAnd you're married for how long?\n\n55:24.020 --> 55:25.020\nOh, we were not married.\n\n55:25.020 --> 55:26.020\nOh, sorry.\n\n55:26.020 --> 55:28.020\nNo, it was like a common law couple.\n\n55:28.020 --> 55:29.020\nPardon?\n\n55:29.020 --> 55:30.020\nCommon law.\n\n55:30.020 --> 55:31.020\nWow.\n\n55:31.020 --> 55:33.020\nDid you have any...\n\n55:33.020 --> 55:39.020\nDo you have any moments when you do one of those snaps where you like shut somebody down\n\n55:39.020 --> 55:42.020\nor just like go into a Sam Jackson monologue?\n\n55:42.020 --> 55:49.020\nDo you have any memories of any like choice singers that you just dropped a bomb on somebody\n\n55:49.020 --> 55:50.020\non the phone?\n\n55:50.020 --> 55:51.020\nIt happened a few times, yes.\n\n55:51.020 --> 55:55.020\nDo you remember like your favorite one?\n\n55:55.020 --> 55:58.020\nIt's mostly like people when they talk about it.\n\n55:58.020 --> 56:06.020\nYeah, trying to recall, but it's such a blur right now, but it's mostly like...\n\n56:06.020 --> 56:07.020\nHow long ago did you say it happened?\n\n56:07.020 --> 56:08.020\nI'm sorry.\n\n56:08.020 --> 56:09.020\nMarch 7th.\n\n56:09.020 --> 56:10.020\nWow.\n\n56:10.020 --> 56:15.020\nAre you just numb to walk around in kind of a daze?\n\n56:15.020 --> 56:18.020\nHave you kind of since come back to you at all?\n\n56:18.020 --> 56:19.020\nMore or less, yes.\n\n56:19.020 --> 56:20.020\nYeah?\n\n56:20.020 --> 56:23.020\nYeah, like today I was just walking around for a few hours before the show and you do\n\n56:23.020 --> 56:29.020\nfeel like sometimes you snap back, you snap out and you just relive the moment again and\n\n56:29.020 --> 56:30.020\nagain and again.\n\n56:30.020 --> 56:33.020\nDo you have like a friend or a family member or do you have like any circle of people that\n\n56:33.020 --> 56:34.020\nare like...\n\n56:34.020 --> 56:36.020\nLike there's been like someone to totally rely on and...\n\n56:36.020 --> 56:37.020\nOh, yes.\n\n56:37.020 --> 56:38.020\nOh, good.\n\n56:38.020 --> 56:39.020\nThat's awesome.\n\n56:39.020 --> 56:45.020\nMy first month, my best friend lived with me, so he was very kind and I thanked him for\n\n56:45.020 --> 56:49.020\ndoing that and I thanked his wife to allow him to spend some time with me and she was\n\n56:49.020 --> 56:52.020\nlike, super happy.\n\n56:52.020 --> 56:53.020\nYou can have him.\n\n56:53.020 --> 56:54.020\nOh, yes.\n\n56:54.020 --> 56:57.020\nShe was like, oh, you can keep it for as long as you want.\n\n56:57.020 --> 56:58.020\nAre you sure?\n\n56:58.020 --> 57:00.020\nI'm getting so much shit done at the house right now.\n\n57:00.020 --> 57:01.020\nIt's amazing.\n\n57:01.020 --> 57:02.020\nExactly.\n\n57:02.020 --> 57:03.020\nThat's what she kept saying.\n\n57:03.020 --> 57:04.020\nI get stuff done finally because he's like...\n\n57:04.020 --> 57:05.020\nWow.\n\n57:05.020 --> 57:12.020\nHow many people this year or within a year or so, how many people out here have lost a\n\n57:12.020 --> 57:15.020\nloved one?\n\n57:15.020 --> 57:17.020\nThere was like a big pause.\n\n57:17.020 --> 57:19.020\nYou made people clap for that, by the way.\n\n57:19.020 --> 57:22.020\nWell, let's hear it, everybody.\n\n57:22.020 --> 57:25.020\nPut those hands together for lost loved ones.\n\n57:25.020 --> 57:27.020\nWell, they came to a comedy show.\n\n57:27.020 --> 57:30.020\nThey're probably looking forward to a little levity.\n\n57:30.020 --> 57:34.020\nThat was less applause than I thought I'd hear.\n\n57:34.020 --> 57:42.020\nIt must be lonely, not even the sense that you lost a loved one, but it's a lonely experience.\n\n57:42.020 --> 57:45.020\nThere's not a bunch of people around you that understand what's happening to you.\n\n57:45.020 --> 57:48.020\nThere was no time to even prepare yourself for it.\n\n57:48.020 --> 57:49.020\nIt just happened.\n\n57:49.020 --> 57:51.020\nIt's just the rugs completely pulled out from under you.\n\n57:51.020 --> 57:52.020\nExactly.\n\n57:52.020 --> 57:55.020\nMy mother passed away and we knew.\n\n57:55.020 --> 58:00.020\nIt was a process and you emotionally kind of get ready for that.\n\n58:00.020 --> 58:04.020\nBut I can't imagine if somebody went poof like that.\n\n58:04.020 --> 58:05.020\nIt's horrifying.\n\n58:05.020 --> 58:08.020\nWhat's the thing that you put yourself into?\n\n58:08.020 --> 58:15.020\nWhat's something that makes you really happy, that you indulge in, that kind of helps you stay?\n\n58:15.020 --> 58:17.020\nWell, it takes your mind off of things.\n\n58:17.020 --> 58:23.020\nWhat's something that's just a habit or an indulgence?\n\n58:23.020 --> 58:25.020\nSpending time with friends.\n\n58:25.020 --> 58:26.020\nThat's mostly it.\n\n58:26.020 --> 58:27.020\nJust spending time, is that what you said?\n\n58:27.020 --> 58:29.020\nSpending time with friends, yes.\n\n58:29.020 --> 58:30.020\nWhat do you do when you spend time with them?\n\n58:30.020 --> 58:31.020\nJust chat?\n\n58:31.020 --> 58:33.020\nJust chat and talk about stories.\n\n58:33.020 --> 58:37.020\nHer name was Mary, so just talk about Mary and stories and share funny stories.\n\n58:37.020 --> 58:40.020\nOh, so you're not taking your mind off it with anything?\n\n58:40.020 --> 58:41.020\nWell, more or less.\n\n58:41.020 --> 58:44.020\nWe're not spending 24 hours just talking about her constantly.\n\n58:44.020 --> 58:47.020\nWe're just chatting about different things.\n\n58:47.020 --> 58:55.020\nSo at this point, it's all about remembering and stuff.\n\n58:55.020 --> 58:58.020\nSo you don't play Minecraft.\n\n58:58.020 --> 59:01.020\nI knew you were hoping he was going to say Minecraft.\n\n59:01.020 --> 59:04.020\nNo, my nephew, he's a big player.\n\n59:04.020 --> 59:05.020\nOkay.\n\n59:05.020 --> 59:06.020\nDoes he play with mod packs?\n\n59:06.020 --> 59:07.020\nYes.\n\n59:07.020 --> 59:09.020\nHe just recently started playing with mod packs.\n\n59:09.020 --> 59:10.020\nFeed the Beast mod packs?\n\n59:10.020 --> 59:11.020\nI don't know.\n\n59:11.020 --> 59:12.020\nOkay.\n\n59:12.020 --> 59:14.020\nIs he here tonight?\n\n59:14.020 --> 59:16.020\nIs he in the audience?\n\n59:16.020 --> 59:17.020\nNo, he's not here, right?\n\n59:17.020 --> 59:18.020\nNo, no, he's not here.\n\n59:18.020 --> 59:19.020\nOkay.\n\n59:19.020 --> 59:24.020\nBecause I found a bug in the Feed the Beast unstable mod pack.\n\n59:24.020 --> 59:28.020\nIf you take an Iron Bucket up to an Ender IO...\n\n59:28.020 --> 59:30.020\nThis is how Dan deals with grief, everybody.\n\n59:30.020 --> 59:34.020\nJust pass this on to everything into a Minecraft conversation.\n\n59:34.020 --> 59:36.020\nDan, it's okay to cry.\n\n59:36.020 --> 59:38.020\nWell, I'm not...\n\n59:38.020 --> 59:41.020\nYeah, I mean, I have no idea how I'll deal with death.\n\n59:41.020 --> 59:42.020\nI mean, it's terrifying.\n\n59:42.020 --> 59:43.020\nMe neither.\n\n59:43.020 --> 59:45.020\nI'm really actually...\n\n59:45.020 --> 59:50.020\nI'm in denial about my denial, about my denial of death.\n\n59:50.020 --> 59:53.020\nLike, it hasn't been put to the test at all yet.\n\n59:53.020 --> 59:56.020\nAnd now I feel like there's no wood to knock on and all this stuff.\n\n59:56.020 --> 59:58.020\nAnd I just like, yeah, I can't even...\n\n59:58.020 --> 01:00:04.020\nI've been so lucky and so untouched by that side of reality.\n\n01:00:04.020 --> 01:00:06.020\nAnd I just can't...\n\n01:00:06.020 --> 01:00:14.020\nI'm gonna show the world the new definition of pussy when anything bad happens to me.\n\n01:00:14.020 --> 01:00:21.020\nLike, I'm gonna be up on my roof wailing at the moon for six years.\n\n01:00:21.020 --> 01:00:24.020\nI felt like doing that sometimes.\n\n01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:26.020\nIs there a way to do that?\n\n01:00:26.020 --> 01:00:27.020\nDo you have a therapist?\n\n01:00:27.020 --> 01:00:28.020\nYes.\n\n01:00:28.020 --> 01:00:29.020\nAre they good?\n\n01:00:29.020 --> 01:00:30.020\nYes.\n\n01:00:30.020 --> 01:00:31.020\nI don't know.\n\n01:00:31.020 --> 01:00:33.020\nI'm actually seeing two.\n\n01:00:33.020 --> 01:00:34.020\nTwo of them?\n\n01:00:34.020 --> 01:00:35.020\nDid they both know?\n\n01:00:35.020 --> 01:00:37.020\nIt's like, that's good, that's good.\n\n01:00:37.020 --> 01:00:38.020\nKeep them on their toes.\n\n01:00:38.020 --> 01:00:39.020\nI like that.\n\n01:00:39.020 --> 01:00:41.020\nI always start my therapy sessions,\n\n01:00:41.020 --> 01:00:43.020\nbut I take them through all the previous therapists\n\n01:00:43.020 --> 01:00:46.020\nand like how I fired them, like what I did.\n\n01:00:46.020 --> 01:00:51.020\nI caught one of them crying and they lied about it.\n\n01:00:51.020 --> 01:00:53.020\nTheir eyes were watering and I said,\n\n01:00:53.020 --> 01:00:54.020\nwhy are you crying?\n\n01:00:54.020 --> 01:00:56.020\nAnd they said, because it's such an emotional story.\n\n01:00:56.020 --> 01:00:57.020\nI said, no, it's not.\n\n01:00:57.020 --> 01:00:59.020\nAnd because it wasn't.\n\n01:00:59.020 --> 01:01:02.020\nAnd then like 20 minutes later, the therapist said,\n\n01:01:02.020 --> 01:01:04.020\nI'm sorry, I feel really bad.\n\n01:01:04.020 --> 01:01:06.020\nI had eye surgery recently.\n\n01:01:06.020 --> 01:01:08.020\nCosmetic eye surgery.\n\n01:01:08.020 --> 01:01:10.020\nSo my eyes are watering.\n\n01:01:10.020 --> 01:01:15.020\nSo my instinct was to lie about it.\n\n01:01:15.020 --> 01:01:18.020\nOkay, good session.\n\n01:01:18.020 --> 01:01:22.020\nSo go out there and be a good person then.\n\n01:01:22.020 --> 01:01:24.020\nTake two of these, call you in the morning.\n\n01:01:24.020 --> 01:01:26.020\nThey're supposed to pay you at that point for that breakthrough.\n\n01:01:26.020 --> 01:01:27.020\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:01:27.020 --> 01:01:29.020\nSo I just never went back anyways.\n\n01:01:29.020 --> 01:01:32.020\nBut yeah, and I always tell that story to my new therapist\n\n01:01:32.020 --> 01:01:34.020\nthat I'm like laying down the law.\n\n01:01:34.020 --> 01:01:36.020\nI'm like, you better fix my head.\n\n01:01:36.020 --> 01:01:38.020\nAnd you better be good.\n\n01:01:38.020 --> 01:01:42.020\nI'm like saw, like when he has that doctor come in\n\n01:01:42.020 --> 01:01:46.020\nand give him craniectomy, because he's got like some kind of thing.\n\n01:01:46.020 --> 01:01:48.020\nAnd he's like, I'm like saw.\n\n01:01:48.020 --> 01:01:50.020\nOkay.\n\n01:01:50.020 --> 01:01:52.020\nThere's like nine saw movies.\n\n01:01:52.020 --> 01:01:54.020\nNow can I ask you just like a crash question?\n\n01:01:54.020 --> 01:01:56.020\nLike is that state health care stuff?\n\n01:01:56.020 --> 01:02:00.020\nLike you get that as a Canadian, you get therapy.\n\n01:02:00.020 --> 01:02:02.020\nIt's part of your...\n\n01:02:02.020 --> 01:02:04.020\nNo, it's through my employer.\n\n01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:05.020\nOkay.\n\n01:02:05.020 --> 01:02:06.020\nAll right.\n\n01:02:06.020 --> 01:02:07.020\nSo now you stay here, Sean Philipp.\n\n01:02:07.020 --> 01:02:08.020\nOkay.\n\n01:02:08.020 --> 01:02:12.020\nSo who's having like a fantastic...\n\n01:02:12.020 --> 01:02:17.020\nLet's go for gender balance.\n\n01:02:17.020 --> 01:02:19.020\nI see a young lady raising her hand.\n\n01:02:19.020 --> 01:02:20.020\nYou back here.\n\n01:02:20.020 --> 01:02:21.020\nLet's get a woman up here.\n\n01:02:21.020 --> 01:02:22.020\nWhat's your name, ma'am?\n\n01:02:22.020 --> 01:02:23.020\nShayna.\n\n01:02:23.020 --> 01:02:24.020\nMademoiselle Shayna, everybody.\n\n01:02:24.020 --> 01:02:25.020\nWelcome Shayna up here.\n\n01:02:25.020 --> 01:02:26.020\nAll right.\n\n01:02:34.020 --> 01:02:36.020\nHe's moving down a stool.\n\n01:02:36.020 --> 01:02:39.020\nYou instinctively applied Carson rules.\n\n01:02:39.020 --> 01:02:44.020\nLike proximity to me is like the important thing.\n\n01:02:44.020 --> 01:02:46.020\nHe just moved over like Ed McMahon.\n\n01:02:46.020 --> 01:02:48.020\nShayna, you're looking very smart and vintage.\n\n01:02:48.020 --> 01:02:50.020\nI like your outfit there.\n\n01:02:50.020 --> 01:02:51.020\nThank you.\n\n01:02:51.020 --> 01:02:52.020\nOh, thank you.\n\n01:02:52.020 --> 01:02:53.020\nWhere are you from, Shayna?\n\n01:02:53.020 --> 01:02:54.020\nI'm from Texas.\n\n01:02:54.020 --> 01:02:55.020\nNo shame?\n\n01:02:55.020 --> 01:02:56.020\nYeah.\n\n01:02:56.020 --> 01:02:57.020\nWhat part of Texas?\n\n01:02:57.020 --> 01:02:59.020\nWest Texas, the dirt round shitty part of Texas.\n\n01:02:59.020 --> 01:03:00.020\nWest Texas?\n\n01:03:00.020 --> 01:03:01.020\nYeah.\n\n01:03:01.020 --> 01:03:02.020\nLike the city of West Texas?\n\n01:03:02.020 --> 01:03:03.020\nNo, Lubbock.\n\n01:03:03.020 --> 01:03:04.020\nNo, Lubbock.\n\n01:03:04.020 --> 01:03:05.020\nLubbock.\n\n01:03:05.020 --> 01:03:06.020\nNo.\n\n01:03:06.020 --> 01:03:08.020\nYou know, the typewriter was invented in Texas.\n\n01:03:08.020 --> 01:03:09.020\nWas it?\n\n01:03:09.020 --> 01:03:10.020\nYes.\n\n01:03:10.020 --> 01:03:11.020\nThat's exciting.\n\n01:03:11.020 --> 01:03:13.020\nAnd the president of Texas is a lady.\n\n01:03:13.020 --> 01:03:14.020\nDid you know that?\n\n01:03:14.020 --> 01:03:15.020\nIt's only.\n\n01:03:15.020 --> 01:03:17.020\nAnd it's the shape of a boot.\n\n01:03:17.020 --> 01:03:18.020\nYes.\n\n01:03:18.020 --> 01:03:19.020\nYep.\n\n01:03:19.020 --> 01:03:20.020\nThat sounds right.\n\n01:03:20.020 --> 01:03:21.020\nOkay.\n\n01:03:21.020 --> 01:03:23.020\nSo why are you so happy?\n\n01:03:23.020 --> 01:03:25.020\nDon't you know this guy's wife died?\n\n01:03:25.020 --> 01:03:27.020\nI'm very sorry.\n\n01:03:27.020 --> 01:03:29.020\nHow do you know you're a problem lady?\n\n01:03:29.020 --> 01:03:30.020\nI'm a sociopath.\n\n01:03:30.020 --> 01:03:31.020\nThat's why I'm happy.\n\n01:03:31.020 --> 01:03:32.020\nNo.\n\n01:03:32.020 --> 01:03:34.020\nSo I'm actually here with my boyfriend.\n\n01:03:34.020 --> 01:03:36.020\nIt's between our birthdays.\n\n01:03:36.020 --> 01:03:38.020\nSo this was our birthday present.\n\n01:03:38.020 --> 01:03:40.020\nDo you guys, how close are your birthdays?\n\n01:03:40.020 --> 01:03:42.020\nHis is on the 13th of July.\n\n01:03:42.020 --> 01:03:44.020\nMine's on the 4th of August.\n\n01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:45.020\nOkay.\n\n01:03:45.020 --> 01:03:50.020\nSo you guys have agreed to, because your birthdays are relatively close, you've merged them into\n\n01:03:50.020 --> 01:03:51.020\na by birthday?\n\n01:03:51.020 --> 01:03:52.020\nNo.\n\n01:03:52.020 --> 01:03:53.020\nNo, no.\n\n01:03:53.020 --> 01:03:55.020\nIt was just that I wanted to come here for my birthday and he wanted to be here for\n\n01:03:55.020 --> 01:03:56.020\nhis birthday.\n\n01:03:56.020 --> 01:03:57.020\nSo here we are.\n\n01:03:57.020 --> 01:03:59.020\nMy show specifically, right?\n\n01:03:59.020 --> 01:04:00.020\nYes.\n\n01:04:00.020 --> 01:04:01.020\nThat was a lie.\n\n01:04:01.020 --> 01:04:02.020\nNo.\n\n01:04:02.020 --> 01:04:03.020\nOkay.\n\n01:04:03.020 --> 01:04:04.020\nI know.\n\n01:04:04.020 --> 01:04:05.020\nI know.\n\n01:04:05.020 --> 01:04:06.020\nOkay.\n\n01:04:06.020 --> 01:04:07.020\nI listened to your show.\n\n01:04:07.020 --> 01:04:08.020\nI'm aware.\n\n01:04:08.020 --> 01:04:09.020\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:04:09.020 --> 01:04:10.020\nDon't apologize, Hannah.\n\n01:04:10.020 --> 01:04:11.020\nDon't apologize.\n\n01:04:11.020 --> 01:04:12.020\nThere's no apology necessary.\n\n01:04:12.020 --> 01:04:13.020\nYou're not Canadian.\n\n01:04:13.020 --> 01:04:14.020\nYou're a Texan.\n\n01:04:14.020 --> 01:04:26.020\nTell me you'll leave if I don't give you enough money.\n\n01:04:26.020 --> 01:04:29.020\nSee, I actually, I have a custom story.\n\n01:04:29.020 --> 01:04:30.020\nOkay.\n\n01:04:30.020 --> 01:04:34.020\nSo I met a man on World of Warcraft.\n\n01:04:34.020 --> 01:04:35.020\nYou wait.\n\n01:04:35.020 --> 01:04:36.020\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:04:36.020 --> 01:04:37.020\nYou met a man on World of Warcraft?\n\n01:04:37.020 --> 01:04:38.020\nI did.\n\n01:04:38.020 --> 01:04:39.020\nYes.\n\n01:04:39.020 --> 01:04:40.020\nDoes your boyfriend know about this man?\n\n01:04:40.020 --> 01:04:41.020\nYeah.\n\n01:04:41.020 --> 01:04:42.020\nHe's aware.\n\n01:04:42.020 --> 01:04:43.020\nOkay.\n\n01:04:43.020 --> 01:04:44.020\nOkay.\n\n01:04:44.020 --> 01:04:45.020\nThis was a long time ago.\n\n01:04:45.020 --> 01:04:46.020\nThis was around eight years ago, something like that.\n\n01:04:46.020 --> 01:04:47.020\nOkay.\n\n01:04:47.020 --> 01:04:53.020\nSo he's French-Canadian and we decided to elope, but when I came through customs, they thought\n\n01:04:53.020 --> 01:04:59.020\nI was a mail order bride because my ex-husband is much older than me.\n\n01:04:59.020 --> 01:05:01.580\nAnd so they just put us through the ringer.\n\n01:05:01.580 --> 01:05:05.580\nEvery time I went through customs, like I get pulled aside with the immigrants for three\n\n01:05:05.580 --> 01:05:07.520\nhours and I have to wait.\n\n01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:09.680\nThey take me into a room and they grill me.\n\n01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:11.220\nThis is Canadian customs, by the way.\n\n01:05:11.220 --> 01:05:12.220\nThis isn't US customs.\n\n01:05:12.220 --> 01:05:17.860\nSo they thought you were marrying a Canadian to become a Canadian?\n\n01:05:17.860 --> 01:05:18.860\nI think so.\n\n01:05:18.860 --> 01:05:19.860\nYeah.\n\n01:05:19.860 --> 01:05:20.860\nWho does that?\n\n01:05:20.860 --> 01:05:21.860\nI don't know.\n\n01:05:21.860 --> 01:05:24.020\nIt's going to happen a lot in November.\n\n01:05:24.020 --> 01:05:25.020\nYeah.\n\n01:05:25.020 --> 01:05:27.220\nA lot of people will be doing that.\n\n01:05:27.220 --> 01:05:28.220\nIs that even necessary?\n\n01:05:28.220 --> 01:05:30.620\nI thought that was like...\n\n01:05:30.620 --> 01:05:32.260\nIt seems that there's a black market.\n\n01:05:32.260 --> 01:05:36.620\nYou pay about $300,000 for the healthcare card because when you immigrate here...\n\n01:05:36.620 --> 01:05:37.620\nOh, the healthcare thing.\n\n01:05:37.620 --> 01:05:38.620\nYes.\n\n01:05:38.620 --> 01:05:39.620\nOf course.\n\n01:05:39.620 --> 01:05:41.500\nSo there are people trying to come up here and get pharmaceuticals and stuff.\n\n01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:45.220\nWell, you'll have people that have cancer and cancer is so expensive to treat in the\n\n01:05:45.220 --> 01:05:48.300\nUS that you come to Canada and it's much more manageable.\n\n01:05:48.300 --> 01:05:52.180\nAnd all you have to do is marry some schmuck and pay...\n\n01:05:52.180 --> 01:05:53.500\nWhat a mind-fuck that is.\n\n01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:55.180\nLike, oh, there's cancer.\n\n01:05:55.180 --> 01:05:57.460\nCancer and cancer is so expensive.\n\n01:05:57.460 --> 01:05:59.180\nWhat's the fucking mind-fuck?\n\n01:05:59.180 --> 01:06:01.620\nWhat the fuck?\n\n01:06:01.620 --> 01:06:02.900\nDid we kill God?\n\n01:06:02.900 --> 01:06:04.700\nWhat is wrong with us?\n\n01:06:04.700 --> 01:06:06.980\nCancer is so expensive in America.\n\n01:06:06.980 --> 01:06:08.780\nIt's like the worst place to get cancer.\n\n01:06:08.780 --> 01:06:10.740\nWhat the fuck is wrong with us?\n\n01:06:10.740 --> 01:06:13.300\nIt's the easiest place and the worst place.\n\n01:06:13.300 --> 01:06:14.300\nYeah.\n\n01:06:14.300 --> 01:06:16.860\nBecause it's probably Wi-Fi, right?\n\n01:06:16.860 --> 01:06:18.780\nWi-Fi has given it to all of us.\n\n01:06:18.780 --> 01:06:20.500\nI blame the Wi-Fi, yeah.\n\n01:06:20.500 --> 01:06:26.900\nSo it's that time we crossed with customs, it took us seven days and three attempts\n\n01:06:26.900 --> 01:06:29.700\nto get across the border to Canada.\n\n01:06:29.700 --> 01:06:31.340\nSo there are three attempts.\n\n01:06:31.340 --> 01:06:32.820\nSo what is a failed attempt like?\n\n01:06:32.820 --> 01:06:39.380\nThey go like, you don't love him, you just want a Band-Aid and then they just...\n\n01:06:39.380 --> 01:06:42.340\nGet out of here and you just go and then you try to come back in.\n\n01:06:42.340 --> 01:06:47.500\nThey turn you around, there's like a mile between the two customs, they turn you around\n\n01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:51.860\nand you have to go back through US customs and explain why you were turned around at\n\n01:06:51.860 --> 01:06:53.860\nthe Canadian border.\n\n01:06:53.860 --> 01:06:57.900\nAnd that's really awkward because when you come back through, they're like, what the fuck\n\n01:06:57.900 --> 01:06:59.500\nare you doing here?\n\n01:06:59.500 --> 01:07:02.460\nAnd then you're like, oh, well, they turned us around and they're like, really?\n\n01:07:02.460 --> 01:07:03.460\nYeah.\n\n01:07:03.460 --> 01:07:04.460\nWhy?\n\n01:07:04.460 --> 01:07:05.460\nWhat if they know that we don't know?\n\n01:07:05.460 --> 01:07:06.460\nYeah.\n\n01:07:06.460 --> 01:07:08.260\nIf they don't like you, why should we like you?\n\n01:07:08.260 --> 01:07:11.100\nAnd the second time, it's always the same customs we tried.\n\n01:07:11.100 --> 01:07:14.420\nSo the second time we came back over, they're like, oh, it's you again, huh?\n\n01:07:14.420 --> 01:07:20.140\nAnd they're like, don't worry, Canadian customs is really shitty, but you're okay with us.\n\n01:07:20.140 --> 01:07:26.260\nYou're always welcome back into the United States, and yeah, I know, it's really weird.\n\n01:07:26.260 --> 01:07:29.060\nIt's always been Canadian customs that's been a problem for me, I don't know.\n\n01:07:29.060 --> 01:07:30.060\nShayna, can I ask you a question?\n\n01:07:30.060 --> 01:07:31.060\nSure.\n\n01:07:31.060 --> 01:07:32.060\nAre you a drug mule?\n\n01:07:32.060 --> 01:07:33.060\nNo.\n\n01:07:33.060 --> 01:07:34.060\nNo?\n\n01:07:34.060 --> 01:07:35.060\nOkay.\n\n01:07:35.060 --> 01:07:36.060\nNo.\n\n01:07:36.060 --> 01:07:37.060\nAre you holding?\n\n01:07:37.060 --> 01:07:38.060\nNo.\n\n01:07:38.060 --> 01:07:42.060\nBut you're in Montreal, you can find something if you want.\n\n01:07:42.060 --> 01:07:46.260\nI want to talk about how do you fall in love with somebody over a world of...\n\n01:07:46.260 --> 01:07:53.500\nSo we used to raid together a lot, the world of Warcraft by nature is time consuming, and\n\n01:07:53.500 --> 01:07:55.260\nit's also very social.\n\n01:07:55.260 --> 01:07:59.780\nSo you spend a lot of time talking to people, and you work together in raids, and you defeat\n\n01:07:59.780 --> 01:08:07.220\nbosses, and that's very kind of dumbing down what WoW is, but so I would spend probably\n\n01:08:07.220 --> 01:08:13.220\neight, nine hours a night with this guy and my guilds doing raids, and you just get to\n\n01:08:13.220 --> 01:08:19.220\nknow a person over that time, and we started talking on MSM Messenger, this was a long\n\n01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:20.220\ntime ago.\n\n01:08:20.220 --> 01:08:23.220\nAnd you're like, Leroy Jenkins, I love you.\n\n01:08:23.220 --> 01:08:24.220\nPretty much, yeah.\n\n01:08:24.220 --> 01:08:25.220\nYeah, exactly.\n\n01:08:25.220 --> 01:08:28.220\nI would like to be Mrs. Leroy Jenkins.\n\n01:08:28.220 --> 01:08:30.220\nWill you make me the happiest?\n\n01:08:30.220 --> 01:08:32.220\nAt least I'll have chicken.\n\n01:08:32.220 --> 01:08:37.300\nBut yeah, no, so we met over there, we got to know each other, and then eventually we\n\n01:08:37.300 --> 01:08:42.700\ndecided to do the intelligent thing by eloping, and then it turned out that that was a bad\n\n01:08:42.700 --> 01:08:43.700\nidea.\n\n01:08:43.700 --> 01:08:46.780\nHow long did that marriage last?\n\n01:08:46.780 --> 01:08:47.780\nAlmost five years.\n\n01:08:47.780 --> 01:08:48.780\nOh yeah.\n\n01:08:48.780 --> 01:08:49.780\nYeah.\n\n01:08:49.780 --> 01:08:55.780\nDivorce is a good thing, like I've changed my position on this recently, and it doesn't\n\n01:08:55.780 --> 01:09:02.420\nhave anything to do with like, you know, Erin and I had a great, tragically short marriage,\n\n01:09:02.420 --> 01:09:07.380\nbut not speaking about the marriage and the quality of it, or especially the quality of\n\n01:09:07.380 --> 01:09:15.020\na partner at all, like putting all of that aside, the idea of divorce, it really shocks\n\n01:09:15.020 --> 01:09:20.660\nyour system into letting go of a bunch of shit you didn't know you were, I always just had\n\n01:09:20.660 --> 01:09:23.780\nall these presuppositions I didn't even know I had about how you're supposed to live the\n\n01:09:23.780 --> 01:09:27.060\nsecond half of a full life, like oh, I'm supposed to do this, I'm supposed to do that, and it's\n\n01:09:27.060 --> 01:09:30.660\nnot that I'm not necessarily going to do those things now, I may get married and have kids\n\n01:09:30.660 --> 01:09:34.540\nor something like that, but now I live in this world where I'm like, oh, none of that\n\n01:09:34.540 --> 01:09:39.540\nis like a carryover for my Midwestern upbringing, like there's not any like tapes that I'm playing\n\n01:09:39.540 --> 01:09:48.020\nin my head that I'm like following the soundtrack of, and I have to imagine, divorce psychologically\n\n01:09:48.020 --> 01:09:51.980\nis as beneficial as like coming out of the closet must be for somebody who like comes\n\n01:09:51.980 --> 01:09:56.140\nout, like because it's like, okay, I'm not going to care as much about spilling a drink\n\n01:09:56.140 --> 01:10:00.300\nat dinner anymore, I'm not going to like freak out, because like I had to tell my parents\n\n01:10:00.300 --> 01:10:05.100\nI'm gay, or I had to look at them, I had to tell everyone I invited to my wedding that\n\n01:10:05.100 --> 01:10:08.860\nthanks for coming and like witnessing us and like, well, we talked about how in love\n\n01:10:08.860 --> 01:10:13.380\nwe were and stuff, and we were just kidding, like, and then you, and then you, and then\n\n01:10:13.380 --> 01:10:17.100\nthey go, that's all right, it was a fun party, thanks for inviting me, I like wearing my\n\n01:10:17.100 --> 01:10:20.540\nsuit, and then you wake up the next day and you're not dead, and you're like, holy shit,\n\n01:10:20.540 -->
