00:00.000 --> 00:12.720
From the Hyatt Regency Hotel and beautiful Montreal Kebbeck,

00:12.720 --> 00:15.560
Harmontown is now in session.

00:15.560 --> 00:21.560
Let's bring out Spencer Triton and everybody.

00:21.560 --> 00:24.160
You know him.

00:24.160 --> 00:25.840
You love him.

00:25.840 --> 00:33.360
You want a piece of him, Spencer.

00:33.360 --> 00:34.360
How you doing, brother?

00:34.360 --> 00:35.360
I'm so good.

00:35.360 --> 00:38.880
How was that chicken sandwich with the McDonald's sitting with you?

00:38.880 --> 00:41.720
It was not so good.

00:41.720 --> 00:52.720
Let's bring out the mayor, Harmontown, Dan Harmon.

00:52.720 --> 00:53.720
Bonjour.

00:53.720 --> 01:08.720
We're going to do the whole show in French.

01:08.720 --> 01:09.720
Dan, almost.

01:09.720 --> 01:10.720
There we are.

01:10.720 --> 01:11.720
The German Pell, and I'm out.

01:11.720 --> 01:12.720
That's it.

01:12.720 --> 01:13.720
That's all I got.

01:13.720 --> 01:17.720
That's two years of French in my high school days.

01:17.720 --> 01:23.200
They make you take French, but you can also take Spanish, and you take each one for a year

01:23.200 --> 01:31.080
and you just kind of, I don't know, if eight here is wheat or ocho, you know, if being

01:31.080 --> 01:37.360
bilingual makes you so great, then how come everyone bilingual isn't rich, you know?

01:37.360 --> 01:41.040
Like you why don't you have twice as much money if it's so important?

01:41.040 --> 01:44.320
I guess Americans can't really have that philosophy anymore.

01:44.320 --> 01:46.320
We're kind of broke now.

01:46.320 --> 01:50.320
The joke, if you speak three languages, you try a language, if you speak two languages,

01:50.320 --> 01:53.320
you're bilingual, if you speak one language, you're American.

01:53.320 --> 01:54.320
Yeah.

01:54.320 --> 02:01.880
We're, yeah, I mean, we may be back here in November forever.

02:01.880 --> 02:04.800
I'm sure you've heard that a lot.

02:04.800 --> 02:11.880
We'll be very low profile, like we're not going to act like we're allowed to be here.

02:11.880 --> 02:16.800
We'll thank you for not building a wall before we get here, and we'll just hang out.

02:16.800 --> 02:20.800
And I will just enjoy sitting in a corner dipping French fries and mayonnaise without

02:20.800 --> 02:21.800
feeling creepy.

02:21.800 --> 02:23.960
Like, I love that so much.

02:23.960 --> 02:28.040
Thank you for that cultural, hey, like, they just brought a bowl of mayonnaise with French

02:28.040 --> 02:31.560
fries and then just like, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, like the French fries may as well be

02:31.560 --> 02:32.560
a spoon.

02:32.560 --> 02:33.560
Yum, yum.

02:33.560 --> 02:40.400
It's just, it's just yummy, yummy, if a gravy on anything you want.

02:40.400 --> 02:43.280
So some Montreal Facts, Jeff.

02:43.280 --> 02:44.280
Oh.

02:44.280 --> 02:53.560
You know, the typewriter was invented here, and the shoe, the shoe was invented here.

02:53.560 --> 02:54.840
Just the left one.

02:54.840 --> 02:55.840
Just the one shoe.

02:55.840 --> 02:56.840
Just the one shoe.

02:56.840 --> 02:59.280
It took another country to invent the other shoe.

02:59.280 --> 03:03.600
Portugal invented the right shoe.

03:03.600 --> 03:08.280
And did you guys know that for a long time, shoes existed before they figured out to make

03:08.280 --> 03:10.160
left and right versions of them?

03:10.160 --> 03:13.280
There was just neutral shoes for a long time.

03:13.280 --> 03:15.280
That makes sense, I guess.

03:15.280 --> 03:16.280
Yeah, yeah.

03:16.280 --> 03:17.280
It's cool.

03:17.280 --> 03:18.280
I love it.

03:18.280 --> 03:19.280
Carry on.

03:19.280 --> 03:26.440
What year did we start making feet-specific shoes?

03:26.440 --> 03:31.680
Ancient history, like, maybe Egypt figured it out or something, but a long time ago.

03:31.680 --> 03:32.680
How are you, Spencer?

03:32.680 --> 03:33.840
I noticed you got more applause than I did.

03:33.840 --> 03:34.840
Oh, yeah.

03:34.840 --> 03:37.360
I don't know about that.

03:37.360 --> 03:38.560
You know why?

03:38.560 --> 03:42.720
Because you're as Canadian as an American can get.

03:42.720 --> 03:45.440
You're like, you know, I meant it as a compliment.

03:45.440 --> 03:50.320
Yeah, you always mean it as a compliment, and I always take it as an insult.

03:50.320 --> 03:51.320
Do I say it a lot?

03:51.320 --> 03:52.320
Yeah.

03:52.320 --> 03:53.320
All the time.

03:53.320 --> 03:54.320
Really?

03:54.320 --> 03:55.320
A Canadian piece of shit?

03:55.320 --> 03:56.320
Yeah.

03:56.320 --> 04:01.320
And just, like, well, you, for instance, you know, you missed your flight.

04:01.320 --> 04:04.640
Like, that's pretty Canadian, because you were probably like, like, why isn't there just

04:04.640 --> 04:08.440
a flight all the time that anyone can just get on, because mass transit?

04:08.440 --> 04:09.440
Right.

04:09.440 --> 04:11.200
You guys love mass transit?

04:11.200 --> 04:13.560
So you missed his flight?

04:13.560 --> 04:14.880
Because of mass transit.

04:14.880 --> 04:18.240
It's connecting dots, just trying to talk about you missing your flight.

04:18.240 --> 04:19.240
No, I love it.

04:19.240 --> 04:21.120
I didn't bring my passport.

04:21.120 --> 04:24.200
I think that you used to not need a passport.

04:24.200 --> 04:25.200
I don't know.

04:25.200 --> 04:26.200
I didn't bring my passport.

04:26.200 --> 04:29.880
That was back when people had the same shoe on both feet.

04:29.880 --> 04:34.720
We invented countries and left and right shoes in 1928.

04:34.720 --> 04:35.720
Yeah.

04:35.720 --> 04:43.480
It was Al Capone invented the right shoe and the passport, and there's stuff flying off

04:43.480 --> 04:44.480
of my mustache.

04:44.480 --> 04:46.040
I don't know if you can see that.

04:46.040 --> 04:49.080
That means it's going to be a good show.

04:49.080 --> 04:51.360
I'm a little sober.

04:51.360 --> 04:52.360
I apologize.

04:52.360 --> 04:54.000
But yeah, the bar is not open.

04:54.000 --> 04:58.880
How do you have a hotel during a festival at one o'clock p.m. and the bar be shut?

04:58.880 --> 04:59.880
It's directly above us.

04:59.880 --> 05:00.880
I think we hit the ceiling.

05:00.880 --> 05:07.720
Can we get some drops of booze to trickle down the light fixtures?

05:07.720 --> 05:11.120
Levy texted us all in a group text this morning telling us where to meet and what the deal

05:11.120 --> 05:12.120
was.

05:12.120 --> 05:25.160
He said, the show is below the bar, and Jeff said, I'll say, I've got some notes.

05:25.160 --> 05:29.480
And then Spencer said, that's what she said, and we're like, okay, let's make this real

05:29.480 --> 05:30.480
clear.

05:30.480 --> 05:34.880
The woman on the text chain was doing, that's what she said, all morning, and by the time

05:34.880 --> 05:37.560
I was doing it, it was very clearly ironic.

05:37.560 --> 05:38.560
Okay.

05:38.560 --> 05:39.560
All right.

05:39.560 --> 05:40.560
That's what she said.

05:40.560 --> 05:46.560
See, then I wrote, then after 100, that's what she said, I wrote, I have a vagina and

05:46.560 --> 05:49.160
like to have sex with men, and no one said anything.

05:49.160 --> 05:50.160
And nobody said anything.

05:50.160 --> 05:51.160
Yeah.

05:51.160 --> 05:54.160
You guys find it hard to get.

05:54.160 --> 05:57.760
That's proof that that's what she said doesn't actually mean that's what she said.

05:57.760 --> 05:58.760
Right.

05:58.760 --> 05:59.760
It means something else.

05:59.760 --> 06:01.320
I don't know what it means.

06:01.320 --> 06:03.680
We don't know who she is, why she keeps saying stuff.

06:03.680 --> 06:04.680
She's pretty chatty.

06:04.680 --> 06:09.680
She says a lot of stuff.

06:09.680 --> 06:11.360
All right.

06:11.360 --> 06:12.880
So let me just look at my...

06:12.880 --> 06:14.480
You have a monitor down.

06:14.480 --> 06:16.480
Do you see yourself down here?

06:16.480 --> 06:18.480
Oh, Jesus.

06:18.480 --> 06:22.560
You can see the own stuff flying up your own mustache.

06:22.560 --> 06:27.320
I took off all my clothes in San Diego, and I was looking at screen grabs of it, and

06:27.320 --> 06:31.920
I was like, I got to get on the elliptical, but then I just ate a quarter pounder with

06:31.920 --> 06:40.560
fromage downstairs, fries with mayonnaise, I fucking hate myself so much, just a fucking

06:40.560 --> 06:42.040
disgusting monster.

06:42.040 --> 06:48.320
Just imagine being my girlfriend and just like looking up at this fucking giant, like

06:48.320 --> 06:55.320
gross flappy tits, like bouncing up and down, and like I like grit my teeth and go, eugh,

06:55.320 --> 07:11.240
eugh, I made a TV show once, I'm going to come thinking about my TV show, looking at

07:11.240 --> 07:17.400
my own tits.

07:17.400 --> 07:18.400
She's a saint.

07:18.400 --> 07:19.400
She's a good woman.

07:19.400 --> 07:25.320
On the flight here, a guy I'm dating sent, I left a little, like, little lovely post-it

07:25.320 --> 07:30.800
notes around the crib, and she was texting Cody, Dan's girlfriend, and she said, oh,

07:30.800 --> 07:35.440
look, she took a picture of one of her post-it notes that I love you on the fridge, and Cody

07:35.440 --> 07:37.920
goes, oh, Dan, shit the bed.

07:37.920 --> 07:38.920
Okay.

07:38.920 --> 07:45.680
Well, I was saving that for later, but it was only a matter of time, you've heard me

07:45.680 --> 07:51.040
talk on the podcast about shitting my pants a lot, and what is a bed but a large pair

07:51.040 --> 07:56.680
of pants you wear for eight hours of your day, and so, of course, it was a matter of

07:56.680 --> 07:58.680
time before I actually took a picture.

07:58.680 --> 07:59.680
You're wearing those giant pants a third of your life.

07:59.680 --> 08:02.600
You're going to poop those pants as much.

08:02.600 --> 08:09.080
I mean, so, like, I'm on this, I know I don't look like it, but I'm on this soylent diet

08:09.080 --> 08:14.600
back at home, like, I'm just trying to, you know, like, if I, and if I'm on the soylent

08:14.600 --> 08:18.640
long enough, like, for a couple of days, it's like, you know, I'm just, I'm just teeing

08:18.640 --> 08:23.040
it up, like, I don't want you to worry about me, like, that I'm always shitting uncontrollably.

08:23.040 --> 08:29.280
I, like, I, so, I just, just full disclosure, and, like, I mean, I just have to tell you

08:29.280 --> 08:34.600
everything, because I was like, this is like, how did you, what happened, and I was like,

08:34.600 --> 08:39.680
I was, I was masturbating, and so, I, I, and I'm,

08:39.680 --> 08:40.680
So you shake yourself.

08:40.680 --> 08:47.360
I'm a, I'm a, I'm a kneeler, and I, so I had my laptop open in front of me, and I was

08:47.360 --> 08:48.360
kneeling.

08:48.360 --> 08:49.360
Okay.

08:49.360 --> 08:50.360
Can I pause for a second?

08:50.360 --> 08:54.680
You don't have to applaud, but by applause, does anybody, anybody, anybody hear a kneeler

08:54.680 --> 08:55.680
when they masturbate?

08:55.680 --> 08:56.680
Yeah, that's what I thought.

08:56.680 --> 08:57.680
Oh, okay.

08:57.680 --> 08:58.680
Really?

08:58.680 --> 08:59.680
It's not, I think a thing?

08:59.680 --> 09:00.680
Are you?

09:00.680 --> 09:01.680
Are you?

09:01.680 --> 09:02.680
You'll kneel?

09:02.680 --> 09:04.320
Was there a gal applauding to you next year?

09:04.320 --> 09:06.880
You're also, I can't really see, are you a gal?

09:06.880 --> 09:07.880
Yes.

09:07.880 --> 09:08.880
You're a kneeler too?

09:08.880 --> 09:09.880
You have.

09:09.880 --> 09:13.680
You have, you have knelts, but you're not a kneeler.

09:13.680 --> 09:14.680
Like a kneeler.

09:14.680 --> 09:15.680
Yeah.

09:15.680 --> 09:16.680
I've done all kinds of shit.

09:16.680 --> 09:17.680
Yeah.

09:17.680 --> 09:20.680
I, I put a pen on my ass, but I'm not an ass-penner.

09:20.680 --> 09:26.880
Like, I, I've done meth, but I'm not a meth-er, like, I'm just a, I'm just an adventurer.

09:26.880 --> 09:30.800
I'm a, I'm a tourist, I'm a connoisseur of, of variety.

09:30.800 --> 09:33.280
There's no other dedicated kneeler here, no?

09:33.280 --> 09:35.800
But I really, I, I really, I'm actually surprised by that.

09:35.800 --> 09:39.160
I've never bothered to ask, because like, for instance, watch this, like, how many people

09:39.160 --> 09:41.800
here wipe their ass standing up?

09:41.800 --> 09:42.800
Sometimes.

09:42.800 --> 09:43.800
See?

09:43.800 --> 09:47.320
I know it's embarrassed, and you have to double that because who's gonna clap?

09:47.320 --> 09:52.520
The brave, and the, and the single, or, or, or, no, no, the other way around, it's probably

09:52.520 --> 09:54.120
the people in couples.

09:54.120 --> 09:55.120
Like, yeah.

09:55.120 --> 09:59.120
But, but, but the, but that's like a really specific thing that you would think is kind

09:59.120 --> 10:00.120
of weird.

10:00.120 --> 10:05.600
And like, it's a, you know, like 40% of the world wipes their ass standing up.

10:05.600 --> 10:07.100
But no kneelers.

10:07.100 --> 10:09.440
So there's something really weird about me.

10:09.440 --> 10:10.780
Like, I don't know what it is.

10:10.780 --> 10:13.820
What percent of the world doesn't have squat toilets, though?

10:13.820 --> 10:15.420
Does that line up?

10:15.420 --> 10:17.100
Like, because in a squat toilet, you probably

10:17.100 --> 10:18.820
have to stand a white.

10:18.820 --> 10:21.180
Oh, well, I don't know how that figures in.

10:21.180 --> 10:22.580
I just looked at it.

10:22.580 --> 10:24.140
We could get someone on that.

10:24.140 --> 10:27.500
I bet it's like 40% of the Western, like, sitting toilet

10:27.500 --> 10:28.020
world.

10:28.020 --> 10:28.740
Oh, OK.

10:28.740 --> 10:29.700
Well, fuck it.

10:29.700 --> 10:31.020
But I'm just guessing.

10:31.020 --> 10:31.780
Yeah, yeah.

10:31.780 --> 10:34.060
We should have like a Harmontown statistician.

10:34.060 --> 10:36.220
Like, somebody's up here and just pulling up stats for us.

10:36.220 --> 10:36.980
Yeah.

10:36.980 --> 10:37.500
It sounds like it.

10:37.500 --> 10:41.740
Did you know that Montreal is the fourth largest country

10:41.740 --> 10:42.220
in the world?

10:45.060 --> 10:49.100
And they have the 16th largest navy.

10:49.100 --> 10:54.820
And each sailor gets their own typewriter.

10:54.820 --> 10:57.460
And who's the current prime minister of Canada, then?

10:57.460 --> 11:00.980
King Geraldo.

11:00.980 --> 11:03.300
He just has one name.

11:03.300 --> 11:05.860
And he's a very controversial figure.

11:05.860 --> 11:09.220
He's run for four terms.

11:09.220 --> 11:12.060
And he loves pickles.

11:12.060 --> 11:14.180
And the metric system.

11:14.180 --> 11:16.060
They make a king run for election?

11:16.060 --> 11:18.220
Mm-hmm.

11:18.220 --> 11:19.100
Yes.

11:19.100 --> 11:21.340
And they call feet yards.

11:21.340 --> 11:23.860
Here, did you know that?

11:23.860 --> 11:27.900
Feet are yards, these people.

11:27.900 --> 11:29.020
You got to love them.

11:29.020 --> 11:30.860
Their trolleys don't have wheels.

11:30.860 --> 11:35.540
They have sleds, little sleds on them.

11:35.540 --> 11:39.780
If you say, excuse me, that means fuck you.

11:39.780 --> 11:42.700
Pants are napkins.

11:42.700 --> 11:48.900
Glasses are an insult to your mother's family,

11:48.900 --> 11:50.100
which is your family as well.

11:54.820 --> 11:56.100
It's just on the matrilineal side.

11:56.100 --> 11:58.620
Excuse me.

11:58.620 --> 11:59.300
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:59.300 --> 12:00.020
Piece of shit.

12:00.020 --> 12:00.520
Whoa.

12:03.540 --> 12:04.980
All right, so you're masturbating.

12:04.980 --> 12:06.940
You're about to shake yourself.

12:06.940 --> 12:08.460
All right, all right.

12:08.460 --> 12:10.500
Let's stay on target here, dad.

12:10.500 --> 12:13.460
Well, maybe we should parcel this thing out.

12:13.460 --> 12:14.780
It'll be like Spalding Grey.

12:14.780 --> 12:16.220
Like, I'll take you up to a little point,

12:16.220 --> 12:17.900
and then I'll talk about some other stuff.

12:17.900 --> 12:21.140
And then I'll go, OK, so here I am, naked and squatting on the.

12:21.140 --> 12:22.780
So I wonder what it is.

12:22.780 --> 12:24.740
I think maybe it's, who knows?

12:24.740 --> 12:25.980
I don't know why I'm a kneeler.

12:25.980 --> 12:26.460
I don't know.

12:26.460 --> 12:28.540
I really thought there would be a couple kneelers in here.

12:28.540 --> 12:29.900
Like, really, like, I can.

12:29.900 --> 12:31.060
Is there an origin story?

12:31.060 --> 12:34.820
I can bring myself to orgasm easily enough,

12:34.820 --> 12:39.900
laying down, or maybe sitting in the lotus position.

12:39.900 --> 12:40.380
I don't know.

12:40.380 --> 12:42.820
Like, I can.

12:42.820 --> 12:45.020
Are there any lotusers here?

12:45.020 --> 12:48.140
I can finish in a variety of ways.

12:48.140 --> 12:51.740
But when it comes to, like, OK, I have work in 10 minutes.

12:51.740 --> 12:53.940
Like, the Uber's on its way.

12:53.940 --> 12:56.660
Like, I'm a kneeler.

12:56.660 --> 12:59.060
Do you flex your legs when you're kneeling?

12:59.060 --> 13:01.860
Or are you just trying to be as neutral as possible?

13:01.860 --> 13:03.180
Like, are your legs doing anything?

13:03.180 --> 13:05.860
Or are they just propping you up to jerk off?

13:05.860 --> 13:11.260
Because, like, sometimes when I'm, like, feeling good,

13:11.260 --> 13:14.220
sometimes when I'm feeling good flexing,

13:14.220 --> 13:15.860
flexing those muscles helps.

13:15.860 --> 13:17.100
It, like, it makes me feel different.

13:17.100 --> 13:18.380
I sit on my heels.

13:18.380 --> 13:19.180
Right.

13:19.180 --> 13:20.100
OK.

13:20.100 --> 13:21.980
So you're like, you look like.

13:21.980 --> 13:24.340
You aren't shitting while you're, like, upright.

13:24.340 --> 13:26.540
You're kind of in just a modified sitting position.

13:26.540 --> 13:28.860
Well, this isn't how I shit, just so to make it clear.

13:28.860 --> 13:31.580
This is how I shitting lower heels.

13:31.580 --> 13:33.820
What I was doing when I shit once.

13:33.820 --> 13:37.860
We're going to start the show in a couple minutes and just.

13:37.860 --> 13:41.340
But I, so I was, I had the laptop open and I'm kneeling.

13:41.340 --> 13:44.220
And I, and I, and I, again, with the Soylent.

13:44.220 --> 13:46.940
And also, I've recently discovered, like,

13:46.940 --> 13:49.860
oh, a little, a couple, a couple of toots on a vape pen.

13:49.860 --> 13:50.700
You know?

13:50.700 --> 13:52.980
Like, makes masturbation more palatable.

13:52.980 --> 13:53.660
Sure.

13:53.660 --> 13:54.220
Palatable.

13:54.220 --> 13:55.220
Like, it's not palatable.

13:55.220 --> 13:56.700
Yeah, it's tough, but it is.

13:56.700 --> 13:58.700
I mean, you know, makes it, like, you know,

13:58.700 --> 14:01.540
it's like less of a drag.

14:01.540 --> 14:04.780
If you get, if you get, if you get high on marijuana,

14:04.780 --> 14:08.220
like, it's, it's, it's fun to jerk off.

14:08.220 --> 14:09.940
Funder.

14:09.940 --> 14:13.860
And so I, but I, and I, so I took a little hit of a joint

14:13.860 --> 14:15.660
and I was kneeling.

14:15.660 --> 14:16.500
And I.

14:16.500 --> 14:18.140
This is last night?

14:18.140 --> 14:20.180
No, this is when I, this is when I.

14:20.180 --> 14:21.500
Oh, two nights ago, rather, yeah.

14:21.500 --> 14:22.500
And I coughed.

14:26.300 --> 14:26.860
I'll do it.

14:26.860 --> 14:29.460
And then, and then I didn't, I didn't know.

14:29.460 --> 14:33.780
I was like, that was a hot one, but, you know,

14:33.780 --> 14:34.660
and then I jerked off.

14:34.660 --> 14:36.020
And then I, but I didn't know.

14:36.020 --> 14:41.100
And then I, like, I guess I, that I fell asleep like.

14:41.100 --> 14:44.100
Oh, no.

14:44.100 --> 14:46.740
Jesus Christ.

14:46.740 --> 14:47.900
It's a blasé attitude.

14:47.900 --> 14:49.940
But you just described, you just showed us how you did it.

14:49.940 --> 14:50.940
Didn't you poop on your feet?

14:50.940 --> 14:52.260
Cause you, you, you probably saw something.

14:52.260 --> 14:54.740
No, this is, my feet aren't underneath my butthole.

14:54.740 --> 14:55.260
They were.

14:55.260 --> 14:59.420
Like, I'm not like a, the land of lakes girl, like.

14:59.420 --> 15:03.500
I'm like, you know, I got you.

15:03.500 --> 15:04.260
All right.

15:04.260 --> 15:06.900
So I'm like a guy on a New York subway.

15:06.900 --> 15:11.380
I'm about three-seater with my, my spread.

15:11.380 --> 15:11.700
Okay.

15:11.700 --> 15:15.140
So you, you, you, you, you drift off to sleep.

15:15.140 --> 15:17.180
And I, and I get up and I got to go do something.

15:17.180 --> 15:21.180
And I look, I go, oh boy, I pooped in the bed.

15:21.180 --> 15:23.700
I see it and I go, I don't have time to do anything with you.

15:23.700 --> 15:24.660
No, she wasn't it.

15:24.660 --> 15:27.580
Why would I be kneeling and masturbating and farting?

15:27.580 --> 15:30.180
I mean, maybe she came in later on and joined you in bed.

15:30.180 --> 15:33.740
No, that's the reason why this is all public knowledge now

15:33.740 --> 15:37.220
is because before we let, we were supposed to meet because,

15:37.220 --> 15:39.380
to, to, to get, because we were going to,

15:39.380 --> 15:41.540
she was going to spend the night and we had an early flight

15:41.540 --> 15:43.460
to come to Montreal.

15:43.460 --> 15:49.940
And like, I, so she, I was at work and she, and then Levy,

15:49.940 --> 15:53.820
I had told Levy that I pooped in the bed, Steve Levy.

15:53.820 --> 15:57.060
That seemed more like a Spencer task, isn't it?

15:57.060 --> 15:59.180
It's nobody's task, but I said, I didn't tell,

15:59.180 --> 16:00.820
I wasn't telling him so we would clean it up.

16:00.820 --> 16:03.220
I was just saying, Spencer, are you jealous that Steve's

16:03.220 --> 16:04.700
leaving out the call?

16:04.700 --> 16:05.900
I would have been real jealous.

16:05.900 --> 16:07.580
Yeah.

16:07.580 --> 16:12.500
I was just, I was said to Levy like, like, like make sure I get,

16:12.500 --> 16:14.740
I need to get home before Cody gets there.

16:14.740 --> 16:18.020
I need to beat her home, like, because I have some things to

16:18.020 --> 16:19.340
tend to, I pooped in the bed.

16:19.340 --> 16:20.780
You just left it there for the day.

16:20.780 --> 16:22.540
I had no choice.

16:22.540 --> 16:23.340
I had to leave.

16:23.340 --> 16:25.100
You're throwing the laundry.

16:25.100 --> 16:26.780
I didn't have time to do anything.

16:26.780 --> 16:29.860
Did you guys just leave the poop on the bed?

16:29.860 --> 16:32.700
Well, I did.

16:32.700 --> 16:34.220
Cody just, Cody's texting me.

16:34.220 --> 16:37.100
She said, don't forget the reason you had to tell me was

16:37.100 --> 16:38.420
because of the new sheets.

16:38.420 --> 16:40.940
Yes, OK.

16:40.940 --> 16:45.060
So the sheets I pooped on were brand new sheets that Cody had

16:45.060 --> 16:47.700
like found on Amazon because I have a King,

16:47.700 --> 16:51.340
California King mattress and, and so she found, I'm going to,

16:51.340 --> 16:52.460
it's getting a little hot up here.

16:52.460 --> 16:55.620
I'm going to take off my sweatshirt.

16:55.620 --> 16:58.100
Don't poop yourself.

16:58.100 --> 17:03.220
I don't know why I'd be sweating up here telling this story.

17:06.220 --> 17:08.100
God damn it.

17:08.100 --> 17:10.780
Such a fucking gross monster.

17:10.780 --> 17:15.580
So I shit on the fucking new sheets that she, so I knew,

17:15.580 --> 17:18.780
even if I, even if the, even if I knew that if she got home

17:18.780 --> 17:22.260
before me, that she'd see that the new sheets came and she'd

17:22.260 --> 17:25.300
be excited, like I knew she'd like want to look at them.

17:25.300 --> 17:28.060
All of them, you know, she'd like whip back the DeVay and go,

17:28.060 --> 17:28.780
look at these new sheets.

17:28.780 --> 17:29.820
You covered us up with the DeVay?

17:29.820 --> 17:32.700
I didn't cover it up.

17:32.700 --> 17:34.580
OK, I guess I maybe, I guess I might.

17:34.580 --> 17:35.540
Geez.

17:35.540 --> 17:36.100
Oh no.

17:36.100 --> 17:37.620
You're a fucking villain.

17:37.620 --> 17:40.220
I'm not, I wasn't trying to hide it from anybody.

17:40.220 --> 17:43.020
I, I have a dog sitter, so I didn't want her to have to look

17:43.020 --> 17:43.780
at shit.

17:43.780 --> 17:46.300
I just figured that she came in the room to get the dogs and

17:46.300 --> 17:49.420
then she, maybe she'd see that I didn't want anyone to have

17:49.420 --> 17:51.820
to deal with my things, you know?

17:51.820 --> 17:53.780
I don't want to have to, people have to see things that would

17:53.780 --> 17:56.420
make them, you know, have to never unsee them, you know?

17:56.420 --> 17:58.820
Like, I don't want people to have to think about who I really

17:58.820 --> 18:01.060
am, it's a burden on people.

18:01.060 --> 18:04.100
It's like, it's like, it's like going to Vietnam, knowing me,

18:04.100 --> 18:07.020
like knowing little things, if you could, you could see things

18:07.020 --> 18:10.220
that would, that would be the equivalent of like, seeing a,

18:10.220 --> 18:11.500
a beheading or something.

18:11.500 --> 18:20.860
So, now you're, you're, you're, so she's texting me and I go,

18:20.860 --> 18:25.420
I just, let me see if I can find the conversation.

18:25.420 --> 18:30.540
She was, I, I, Steve, Steve comes running in and he goes

18:30.540 --> 18:33.220
like, Cody's on her way to your house.

18:33.220 --> 18:35.460
And she has a key.

18:35.460 --> 18:36.340
Scrolling.

18:36.340 --> 18:39.620
And I, and he knows why that's dangerous.

18:39.620 --> 18:40.740
Right.

18:40.740 --> 18:42.260
This is like high noon all of a sudden.

18:42.260 --> 18:45.300
We should have locked the gate.

18:45.300 --> 18:47.380
She couldn't even use her house key that way.

18:47.380 --> 18:49.940
I don't, I wasn't thinking when I left the house, I have to

18:49.940 --> 18:51.220
keep Cody out of the house.

18:51.220 --> 18:54.460
I was thinking, I have to come home early and clean up my shit.

18:54.460 --> 18:55.500
That's a good thought.

18:59.500 --> 19:00.900
I'm just looking for this.

19:00.900 --> 19:01.500
Sorry.

19:01.500 --> 19:06.860
It's a, let's all look up stuff on our phones.

19:06.860 --> 19:10.420
Oh, Spencer, talk about the one pen thing on airplanes.

19:10.420 --> 19:12.860
This is called, this is a segment called, let's uncork

19:12.860 --> 19:14.180
Spencer's rage.

19:14.180 --> 19:15.740
Yeah.

19:15.740 --> 19:20.180
So when you fly here, you got to fill out a sheet.

19:20.180 --> 19:21.340
I don't even know why.

19:21.340 --> 19:23.580
I guess it's just so like they know if you're taking like

19:23.580 --> 19:25.740
large amounts of money into the country or like

19:25.740 --> 19:26.740
plants or something.

19:26.740 --> 19:27.540
I don't know.

19:27.540 --> 19:29.780
But you got to fill out a sheet, but then they don't have

19:29.780 --> 19:33.900
any pens on the plane because pens are very expensive.

19:33.900 --> 19:35.740
We all know this.

19:35.740 --> 19:38.500
How much, how much money have you guys spent in pens in the

19:38.500 --> 19:39.140
last year?

19:39.140 --> 19:42.260
Because for me, it's at least $1,000.

19:42.260 --> 19:45.060
And I'm not even an airline.

19:45.060 --> 19:49.180
And God knows on an airplane, like spaces at a premiums and

19:49.180 --> 19:53.060
pens are so bulky, they're like, they're like a million hot

19:53.060 --> 19:57.780
towels worth of space or shitty meals or fucking weird

19:57.780 --> 20:01.420
crackers or all the other crap they jam into a plane.

20:01.420 --> 20:04.660
And it's not like you can place them in a bag.

20:04.660 --> 20:07.380
No, they fall right out.

20:07.380 --> 20:09.980
And they'd make a lousy promotional tool because you

20:09.980 --> 20:11.620
can't put your logo on them.

20:11.620 --> 20:12.540
No.

20:12.540 --> 20:13.980
And no one ever needs one.

20:13.980 --> 20:16.300
And they never give one to anyone else.

20:16.300 --> 20:19.700
And everyone's always traveling with writing utensils.

20:19.700 --> 20:22.460
Any time I go out of the door, I have writing utensils.

20:22.460 --> 20:24.300
I got a colored pencil set.

20:24.300 --> 20:30.420
Wallet, key, phone, ballpoint pen, because I'm a form filler.

20:30.420 --> 20:31.140
Yeah.

20:31.140 --> 20:32.580
That's what we do.

20:32.580 --> 20:36.220
And also just writing on paper is so today, it's so

20:36.220 --> 20:36.820
useful.

20:36.820 --> 20:40.180
Like everyone's writing just stuff down on pieces of paper

20:40.180 --> 20:42.620
these days.

20:42.620 --> 20:45.100
You'd think that they'd have taken care of that with note

20:45.100 --> 20:48.980
taking apps on phones or word processors on computers.

20:48.980 --> 20:50.980
Anyway, they don't have any fucking pens.

20:50.980 --> 20:52.380
They make you fill out a form.

20:52.380 --> 20:55.220
But the thing is, there are pens on the plane, but God help

20:55.220 --> 20:57.580
you if you get off the plane without filling out that form.

20:57.580 --> 21:00.980
Because in the way to get out of the airport, there's

21:00.980 --> 21:02.660
absolutely no one who will give you a pen.

21:02.660 --> 21:05.100
And they'll tell you they're not allowed to give you a pen.

21:05.100 --> 21:06.100
Or they did last time.

21:06.100 --> 21:06.460
I don't know.

21:06.460 --> 21:08.380
This time I brought it from the guy next to me.

21:08.380 --> 21:14.340
But then you're just trapped in another country without

21:14.340 --> 21:17.020
cellular data service, in most cases.

21:17.020 --> 21:20.580
And you have to fill out a form without any ability to fill

21:20.580 --> 21:21.140
out a form.

21:21.140 --> 21:22.900
Like there's literally nothing you can do.

21:22.900 --> 21:25.380
You can't go to a store and buy a pen because you're not on

21:25.380 --> 21:26.700
that side of the thing.

21:26.700 --> 21:30.300
So you're just stuck in this legal limbo where you have to

21:30.300 --> 21:32.180
fill out this form that says I'm not carrying

21:32.180 --> 21:34.980
plants or $20,000.

21:34.980 --> 21:36.380
How often does that come up?

21:36.380 --> 21:38.140
Who gets that information?

21:38.140 --> 21:40.940
How do they know if you're lying?

21:40.940 --> 21:43.220
What if your address is off by a digit?

21:43.220 --> 21:44.700
Like who gives a shit?

21:44.700 --> 21:47.220
If they're able to catch you in that, then why don't they

21:47.220 --> 21:48.060
have the information?

21:48.060 --> 21:49.980
Why would you have to fill out a form?

21:49.980 --> 21:51.220
However they would have kept it.

21:51.220 --> 21:54.140
Oh, so you live at 123 Hibiscus?

21:54.140 --> 21:55.140
Sure.

21:55.140 --> 21:57.060
Ha.

21:57.060 --> 22:00.180
But what are they catching with that process?

22:00.180 --> 22:01.620
The guy asked me a million questions.

22:01.620 --> 22:02.980
I don't fucking know where I'm going.

22:02.980 --> 22:04.180
How are we going to leave them?

22:04.180 --> 22:05.220
What are you doing in Montreal?

22:05.220 --> 22:06.420
I'm here for the festival.

22:06.420 --> 22:07.660
What?

22:07.660 --> 22:09.100
The guys kept saying what every time.

22:09.100 --> 22:11.260
I'm like, if your job is to interrogate dumb fat

22:11.260 --> 22:14.580
Americans coming into your country, learn to recognize

22:14.580 --> 22:17.140
mumbling.

22:17.140 --> 22:19.780
I was like, I'm here for the Just for Laughs Festival.

22:19.780 --> 22:20.460
What?

22:20.460 --> 22:23.140
I was here for the Just for Laughs Festival.

22:23.140 --> 22:27.140
Oh, do you have a letter?

22:27.140 --> 22:28.980
A letter?

22:28.980 --> 22:32.540
I haven't had a letter since 1989.

22:32.540 --> 22:33.580
Who has a letter?

22:33.580 --> 22:35.980
What am I, Paul Revere?

22:35.980 --> 22:37.220
Do I have a letter?

22:37.220 --> 22:38.540
Is this Game of Thrones?

22:38.540 --> 22:39.900
What the fuck are you talking about?

22:39.900 --> 22:41.500
Do you have a radio?

22:41.500 --> 22:45.980
I sent it for a crow so I can enter your fucking house

22:45.980 --> 22:46.460
tully.

22:46.460 --> 22:47.180
What the fuck?

22:47.180 --> 22:48.060
What?

22:48.060 --> 22:50.140
Now, Canadian customs people are much nicer

22:50.140 --> 22:51.820
than the US customs people.

22:51.820 --> 22:53.620
Yeah, but there's still customs people.

22:53.620 --> 22:58.660
That's like saying, oh, my turgid is more fiber in it.

22:58.660 --> 23:01.580
I think two times, Greg Proops, we travel to Canada a lot.

23:01.580 --> 23:05.900
And Greg Proops, the comedian and friend of the show,

23:05.900 --> 23:09.340
he twice, so what's your occupation?

23:09.340 --> 23:10.940
He goes, I'm a comedian.

23:10.940 --> 23:14.700
And I go, no, it's like you're an American.

23:14.700 --> 23:15.900
I didn't say it was Canadian.

23:15.900 --> 23:16.900
I said it was a comedian.

23:16.900 --> 23:18.820
That's twice that's happened from a comedian.

23:22.660 --> 23:26.020
Like you'd go up to customs and be like, I'm a Canadian.

23:26.020 --> 23:28.420
Let me in for a living.

23:28.420 --> 23:30.220
That's how I make my money.

23:30.220 --> 23:31.420
But I go, I'm a Canadian.

23:31.420 --> 23:32.580
Do you have a letter?

23:32.580 --> 23:33.500
What are you talking about?

23:33.500 --> 23:35.980
And he says, oh, usually there's a letter.

23:35.980 --> 23:37.580
An invitation to perform a question.

23:37.580 --> 23:38.780
And then they send you a letter.

23:38.780 --> 23:40.620
I'm like, well, I guess that letter

23:40.620 --> 23:42.900
would get sent to a letter receiver.

23:42.900 --> 23:46.020
I am a performer.

23:46.020 --> 23:48.100
I am an artist.

23:48.100 --> 23:50.820
He's like, oh, well, sir, are you traveling with a party?

23:50.820 --> 23:51.660
I said, yes, I am.

23:51.660 --> 23:53.740
And he said, so where are you going?

23:53.740 --> 23:56.780
I said, your mom's house.

23:56.780 --> 23:57.940
I said, a hotel.

23:57.940 --> 23:58.860
Which one?

23:58.860 --> 24:01.060
I don't know.

24:01.060 --> 24:02.540
We had the exact same conversation.

24:02.540 --> 24:03.860
I'm hard going to pick me up.

24:03.860 --> 24:07.060
Like, I have left that brain space

24:07.060 --> 24:10.180
free for hilarious stories about shitting in a bed.

24:10.180 --> 24:12.980
Meanwhile, Seth Rogen was on our flight.

24:12.980 --> 24:15.420
And that dude got shot out of there on a magic carpet.

24:15.420 --> 24:16.700
He didn't do anything.

24:16.700 --> 24:18.340
There was a good-looking middle-aged woman

24:18.340 --> 24:20.260
who picked him up and just like put him up.

24:20.260 --> 24:23.060
Like they carried him out on a litter like Cleopatra.

24:23.060 --> 24:24.660
And he just fucking, it was amazing.

24:24.660 --> 24:27.100
Yeah, I was looking at Seth Rogen like on the plane.

24:27.100 --> 24:28.740
And I was just thinking about that.

24:28.740 --> 24:31.340
I'm like, does he have to fill out this fucking form

24:31.340 --> 24:32.380
and look for a pen?

24:32.380 --> 24:33.060
I bet he doesn't.

24:33.060 --> 24:36.060
I bet Alec Baldwin doesn't go to the DMV.

24:36.060 --> 24:38.140
Or that's a driver thing.

24:38.140 --> 24:39.820
I don't know if they call it here.

24:39.820 --> 24:49.100
Le cart de la department of the fromage vehicles.

24:49.100 --> 24:52.660
Vehicle Le Mans.

24:52.660 --> 24:55.540
Why is he mocking our language?

24:55.540 --> 24:57.340
Look at him.

24:57.340 --> 25:00.380
And why is he entitled to leap across the border

25:00.380 --> 25:04.580
with no letter?

25:04.580 --> 25:06.380
I mean, I don't think I'm entitled.

25:06.380 --> 25:07.820
You should lock me out if you want.

25:07.820 --> 25:09.540
But I was calling the guys bluff.

25:09.540 --> 25:11.260
I'm like thinking, let's see where this goes.

25:11.260 --> 25:13.700
Am I going to go to Guantanamo?

25:13.700 --> 25:16.340
I've been taking a secondary screening in Canada.

25:16.340 --> 25:19.580
And I got everything but being duct taped to a folding chair.

25:19.580 --> 25:20.740
It was like, they sent me there.

25:20.740 --> 25:22.820
I went through all my shit and gave me a look.

25:22.820 --> 25:25.500
He did write a 94 on the bottom of my thing.

25:25.500 --> 25:27.020
And I was like, I passed.

25:27.020 --> 25:30.060
But then Cody's had like a 63 or something.

25:30.060 --> 25:32.460
I was like, wait, is this percentage chance you're

25:32.460 --> 25:35.220
a terrorist for the next people that check?

25:35.220 --> 25:36.460
Because there's like a big 94.

25:36.460 --> 25:38.420
I was actually really scared that they were going to go,

25:38.420 --> 25:40.180
a 94 come with me.

25:40.180 --> 25:42.860
And yeah, like find out what Canadian waterboarding is.

25:42.860 --> 25:45.220
Mine had a big X and a 35.

25:45.220 --> 25:47.660
Because I was going through the thing where you type in,

25:47.660 --> 25:49.420
you put little foreign, they scan that in.

25:49.420 --> 25:50.380
That's new for me.

25:50.380 --> 25:51.140
They scan it in.

25:51.140 --> 25:53.820
And it's like, you didn't say date left Canada.

25:53.820 --> 25:55.260
And I was like, I don't know.

25:55.260 --> 25:58.180
Date left Canada, and I was like, haven't left Canada.

25:58.180 --> 25:58.900
Just got to Canada.

25:58.900 --> 25:59.940
That happened to me too.

25:59.940 --> 26:01.580
And I was like, OK, I'll say the date.

26:01.580 --> 26:02.500
I will leave Canada.

26:02.500 --> 26:03.300
So I write that down.

26:03.300 --> 26:05.860
And then it goes, sorry, it shoots it back out.

26:05.860 --> 26:06.820
It can read.

26:06.820 --> 26:09.180
And it says, you didn't say how much money you're bringing in.

26:09.180 --> 26:10.180
And so I wrote zero.

26:10.180 --> 26:11.780
And he goes, you didn't say how much money.

26:11.780 --> 26:13.580
So I wrote a bunch of zeros in there.

26:13.580 --> 26:14.860
And I'm lying through them all.

26:14.860 --> 26:16.780
And then it goes, how many plants do you have?

26:16.780 --> 26:18.980
I said, I just wrote zero.

26:18.980 --> 26:20.140
And he goes, all right, we're going

26:20.140 --> 26:22.300
to have to ask you a lot more questions.

26:22.300 --> 26:25.140
Why do you have zero plants?

26:25.140 --> 26:26.860
I mean, those machines are new.

26:26.860 --> 26:29.060
He's supposed to bring a gift.

26:29.060 --> 26:31.420
You're going to see the Lannisters for God's sake.

26:31.420 --> 26:33.500
You're empty handed?

26:33.500 --> 26:36.220
Where is your poppy milk?

26:36.220 --> 26:37.300
Milk of the poppy.

26:37.300 --> 26:38.980
I've brought the letter a million times to Canada

26:38.980 --> 26:40.700
where you get this letter of invitation that says,

26:40.700 --> 26:43.020
where you're performing, what kind of theater, what the deal

26:43.020 --> 26:44.900
is, who you're with, all this stuff.

26:44.900 --> 26:45.860
And they never read it.

26:45.860 --> 26:46.540
They just look at it.

26:46.540 --> 26:48.460
You show them the letter and they go, OK, he has the letter.

26:48.460 --> 26:50.260
And it's a cursory glance of the thing.

26:50.260 --> 26:51.820
You can just hand them like a book.

26:51.820 --> 26:53.820
And of course, ISIS could never get a hold of a Just

26:53.820 --> 26:55.940
for Last letter.

26:55.940 --> 26:58.980
It's just not within their fucking capability.

26:58.980 --> 27:02.020
We've got so many other things to think about.

27:02.020 --> 27:05.700
Yeah, we got ISIS to think about.

27:05.700 --> 27:08.940
Remember, there was a guy in America,

27:08.940 --> 27:12.340
there was a mailman that landed on the lawn with letters

27:12.340 --> 27:14.780
for Congress to talk about campaign reform.

27:14.780 --> 27:19.180
It was like a performance art slash protest slash possible

27:19.180 --> 27:21.540
martyrdom because he knew there was a chance they might shoot

27:21.540 --> 27:23.060
him out of the sky.

27:23.060 --> 27:24.540
It's a guy who made his own helicopter, right?

27:24.540 --> 27:27.580
He made like a little lawn chair with a helicopter blade

27:27.580 --> 27:31.060
on it and like he just landed right next to the Congress.

27:31.060 --> 27:32.100
And they took him to jail.

27:32.100 --> 27:33.060
They should hire that guy.

27:33.060 --> 27:34.820
He makes his own helicopters.

27:34.820 --> 27:36.140
And it was like, OK, great.

27:36.140 --> 27:37.740
This is like, OK, campaign reform.

27:37.740 --> 27:39.540
Now we're going to talk about it a little bit.

27:39.540 --> 27:42.020
And like five minutes later, the top story on CNN

27:42.020 --> 27:46.220
was, how many ISIS could have fit on that helicopter?

27:46.220 --> 27:47.140
What if that was an ISIS?

27:47.140 --> 27:49.580
I think they're so important, people want to kill them.

27:49.580 --> 27:55.020
These lawmakers, oh, they're going to come in here and ISIS us.

27:55.020 --> 27:57.580
Then the country will shut down because there's not

27:57.580 --> 28:00.260
a bunch of fucking jerks banging gavels

28:00.260 --> 28:02.100
and whatever they do in there.

28:02.100 --> 28:04.740
All right, hate government, stupid.

28:04.740 --> 28:08.380
Did you know that Montreal's government is divided

28:08.380 --> 28:11.940
into four quadrants?

28:11.940 --> 28:13.140
The press?

28:13.140 --> 28:20.060
The judicial, the police, and mass transit.

28:20.060 --> 28:22.420
And they all checked and balances.

28:22.420 --> 28:25.420
The way a bill becomes a law, they don't call it a law here.

28:25.420 --> 28:32.460
They call it a lul, is that you have to, a judicial has to,

28:32.460 --> 28:33.820
have an idea.

28:33.820 --> 28:37.020
And then he gives it to a bus driver.

28:37.020 --> 28:39.820
If a majority of the bus drivers,

28:39.820 --> 28:45.100
think that it's an OK idea, then they pass that up to the police.

28:45.100 --> 28:48.660
Who don't carry guns and who simply say thank you.

28:48.660 --> 28:51.500
And then the bus drivers say sorry.

28:51.500 --> 28:52.820
And then they say thank you.

28:52.820 --> 28:53.940
Sorry.

28:53.940 --> 28:57.780
And then after a while, it's a law, but you can break it too.

28:57.780 --> 29:01.060
And they'll just make you a policeman.

29:01.060 --> 29:02.460
It's a perfect system.

29:02.460 --> 29:04.460
You know how many people died here last year?

29:04.460 --> 29:04.940
Zero.

29:04.940 --> 29:05.460
What?

29:05.460 --> 29:06.780
Yeah, it's like Britain.

29:06.780 --> 29:10.020
I assume, I never read it.

29:10.020 --> 29:11.020
Have you seen Brigadoon?

29:11.020 --> 29:12.020
No.

29:14.020 --> 29:16.860
It's like Westworld, but with no guests.

29:16.860 --> 29:18.860
But they're not robots, they just don't die.

29:22.700 --> 29:25.500
You know, it's that last time there was a mass shooting in Canada?

29:25.500 --> 29:30.500
It was a paintball game.

29:30.500 --> 29:34.020
They try not to shoot each other when they play paintball up here.

29:34.020 --> 29:38.020
There was an American, he went nuts, he shot everybody.

29:38.020 --> 29:45.020
And their flags were at quarter mass, four, six deacons,

29:45.020 --> 29:48.020
which is what they call a month here.

29:48.020 --> 29:50.020
Do they have a metric calendar here?

29:50.020 --> 29:51.020
10 months make a year.

29:51.020 --> 29:52.020
Isn't that simpler?

29:52.020 --> 29:54.020
Each month is 10 days.

29:54.020 --> 29:56.020
Makes sense.

29:56.020 --> 30:01.020
How many days in a year?

30:01.020 --> 30:02.020
A hundred.

30:02.020 --> 30:03.020
A hundred.

30:03.020 --> 30:06.020
I was about to say a thousand.

30:06.020 --> 30:11.020
It's a simple system.

30:11.020 --> 30:17.020
Okay, Spencer, can you come share a mic so you can read Cody's lines in this text conversation?

30:17.020 --> 30:20.020
Yeah, so I come up there, I'll use your mic.

30:20.020 --> 30:22.020
Okay, great.

30:22.020 --> 30:32.020
Yeah, okay, so Thursday, 9.03 p.m., you're gray, so you're Cody.

30:32.020 --> 30:35.020
Okay, I might get to your house a little early if that's okay,

30:35.020 --> 30:38.020
so Nicole can drive me and I don't have to Uber.

30:38.020 --> 30:40.020
Are you on your way?

30:40.020 --> 30:42.020
Not yet.

30:42.020 --> 30:45.020
Nicole was gonna drive me in about five to ten minutes,

30:45.020 --> 30:48.020
but I can change that plan if needed.

30:48.020 --> 30:59.020
It's okay, but it necessitates me warning you about one thing.

30:59.020 --> 31:03.020
It's not sex doll related.

31:03.020 --> 31:06.020
Okay, I can wait if it makes you uncomfortable.

31:06.020 --> 31:08.020
That's great, that's awesome.

31:08.020 --> 31:10.020
I can just Uber when you're ready.

31:10.020 --> 31:12.020
That's no big deal.

31:12.020 --> 31:17.020
I guess I'd rather just tell you now because otherwise you'll have to make up guesses in your head.

31:17.020 --> 31:19.020
That was a bad move, Dan.

31:19.020 --> 31:21.020
She just went with it.

31:21.020 --> 31:23.020
That's true.

31:23.020 --> 31:31.020
The new sheets came and Sophia put them on the bed on Tuesday,

31:31.020 --> 31:35.020
and they're gray.

31:35.020 --> 31:38.020
At risk.

31:38.020 --> 31:44.020
And then last night I accidentally kind of shit on them.

31:44.020 --> 31:50.020
Ha ha ha! Oh, my.

31:50.020 --> 31:55.020
And I didn't see until this morning. God.

31:55.020 --> 31:58.020
There's a visible stain.

31:58.020 --> 32:00.020
So what's our plan for sleeping tonight?

32:00.020 --> 32:02.020
Are the old sheets still somewhere?

32:02.020 --> 32:04.020
By the way, I'm not judging you, baby.

32:04.020 --> 32:06.020
Just trying to solve the problem solved for later.

32:06.020 --> 32:08.020
It's also gray.

32:08.020 --> 32:10.020
Well, it's not...

32:10.020 --> 32:12.020
I just need to hit it with some cleaner.

32:12.020 --> 32:17.020
You never had to know, but now I had to tell you because you're getting there before me

32:17.020 --> 32:20.020
and you were going to see this new sheets and want to look at them

32:20.020 --> 32:22.020
and then you were going to see this stain.

32:22.020 --> 32:24.020
Ha ha ha! Okay.

32:24.020 --> 32:27.020
Well, I don't think I'm going to get there before you anyway now

32:27.020 --> 32:30.020
because I released Nicole when you said you had to tell me something.

32:30.020 --> 32:32.020
So I'll just meet you there at seven.

32:32.020 --> 32:36.020
Ergo. Erg.

32:36.020 --> 32:38.020
An auto-corrected different.

32:38.020 --> 32:42.020
Sorry. I didn't know what it was going to be and I didn't want her to keep you...

32:42.020 --> 32:45.020
and I didn't want to keep her waiting, so I just told her to go on.

32:45.020 --> 32:47.020
Well, now you know.

32:47.020 --> 32:49.020
I shit on the new sheets you picked out.

32:49.020 --> 32:52.020
Ha ha. I don't care. I didn't pay for them.

32:52.020 --> 32:54.020
You can order a million more!

32:54.020 --> 32:57.020
I was just making sure we get a plan tonight because I know you're...

32:57.020 --> 32:59.020
because you know I'm sort of OCD about germs.

32:59.020 --> 33:02.020
Trying to get over it, but I'm still not cured.

33:02.020 --> 33:09.020
I... well, yeah, I just was scanning ahead because I didn't want to invade her privacy.

33:09.020 --> 33:11.020
Yeah, I just thought of that.

33:11.020 --> 33:13.020
Yeah.

33:13.020 --> 33:15.020
Kay.

33:15.020 --> 33:17.020
I just thought of that.

33:17.020 --> 33:19.020
No, I have questions.

33:19.020 --> 33:21.020
Good thing she's not OCD about privacy.

33:21.020 --> 33:26.020
By the way, did you already head back to the house because I was going to say if it's easy...

33:26.020 --> 33:28.020
Oh, that's her. Sorry.

33:28.020 --> 33:30.020
That's what you skipped away a lot.

33:30.020 --> 33:32.020
Let's skip ahead.

33:32.020 --> 33:34.020
Yeah.

33:34.020 --> 33:36.020
Let's see.

33:36.020 --> 33:38.020
I was... oh.

33:38.020 --> 33:41.020
Oh, by the way, okay, you read that part, sorry.

33:41.020 --> 33:42.020
I'm really fucking herself.

33:42.020 --> 33:47.020
Kay, by the way, did you already head back to the house because I was going to say if it's easier for me to meet you in BeBank...

33:47.020 --> 33:48.020
I could just do that.

33:48.020 --> 33:50.020
And my social security number...

33:52.020 --> 33:55.020
Oh, well, yeah, I'm almost home.

33:55.020 --> 34:00.020
I was only going home to, you know, clean the shit stain.

34:00.020 --> 34:02.020
Ah, potato.

34:02.020 --> 34:04.020
Is that like a curse word?

34:04.020 --> 34:06.020
No, that's a pet name.

34:06.020 --> 34:07.020
All right, well, I tried.

34:07.020 --> 34:09.020
Well, you can still do that now.

34:09.020 --> 34:15.020
And I know so you can get extra points that would have otherwise just gone unnoticed.

34:15.020 --> 34:18.020
I don't think that's how cleaning up your own shit works.

34:20.020 --> 34:22.020
I think it's better when nobody knows.

34:22.020 --> 34:26.020
By the way, does Levy know about this whole thing?

34:26.020 --> 34:30.020
Because it would make our text exchange a lot funnier if I knew he was covering for you.

34:30.020 --> 34:32.020
Because he was like being super bae.

34:32.020 --> 34:33.020
Right.

34:33.020 --> 34:34.020
That's good though.

34:34.020 --> 34:35.020
It depends on when you talked.

34:35.020 --> 34:37.020
We can compare timestamps and figure it out.

34:37.020 --> 34:38.020
I don't know.

34:38.020 --> 34:39.020
Uh, okay.

34:41.020 --> 34:42.020
Yeah, I don't know.

34:42.020 --> 34:43.020
This is all fine.

34:43.020 --> 34:44.020
Yeah, I mean, well...

34:44.020 --> 34:47.020
I mean, it looks like it transitions out of this conversation.

34:47.020 --> 34:48.020
Great.

34:48.020 --> 34:49.020
Okay, great.

34:49.020 --> 34:51.020
Thank you, Spencer.

34:51.020 --> 34:54.020
Had we planned that, we could have ended on a big thing.

34:54.020 --> 34:57.020
Like a lion coming out in the text or something.

34:57.020 --> 34:58.020
Potato.

34:58.020 --> 35:00.020
I have a couple questions.

35:00.020 --> 35:02.020
I'm a potato.

35:02.020 --> 35:03.020
She's a bean.

35:03.020 --> 35:04.020
Potato and bean.

35:04.020 --> 35:06.020
Yeah, because I'm like a...

35:06.020 --> 35:08.020
Potato is like a giant bean.

35:08.020 --> 35:09.020
Kind of.

35:09.020 --> 35:11.020
But that lives in dirt.

35:12.020 --> 35:14.020
So the beans, don't they?

35:14.020 --> 35:18.020
A bean grows on a plant in the sunlight and it heals people.

35:18.020 --> 35:19.020
It's good for you.

35:19.020 --> 35:22.020
Potato is just a fucking gross piece of shit.

35:23.020 --> 35:26.020
Giant, subterranean, obese bean.

35:27.020 --> 35:30.020
Covered in filth and warts.

35:31.020 --> 35:35.020
Waiting to be dug up and turned into something better by anyone.

35:38.020 --> 35:40.020
Possibly with a knife.

35:43.020 --> 35:47.020
Begging to be cut, stabbed, microwaved.

35:47.020 --> 35:51.020
Speaking of the cacking potatoes and Seth Rogan.

35:51.020 --> 35:53.020
What about the sausage party?

35:53.020 --> 35:55.020
Have you seen this? Have you heard about this?

35:55.020 --> 35:56.020
I've seen the average type.

35:56.020 --> 35:58.020
The foods, they're alive.

35:59.020 --> 36:01.020
They got feelings and personalities.

36:01.020 --> 36:02.020
But here's the thing.

36:02.020 --> 36:03.020
I mean, toy store, you get it.

36:03.020 --> 36:06.020
It's like these are things they're made for children to enjoy

36:06.020 --> 36:09.020
and part of the love of the child brings the toys to life.

36:09.020 --> 36:10.020
I get it.

36:10.020 --> 36:13.020
But you have like lettuce that's like alive

36:13.020 --> 36:16.020
and a potato that's alive and hot dogs that are alive

36:16.020 --> 36:18.020
and bacon that's alive.

36:18.020 --> 36:20.020
But when does that happen?

36:20.020 --> 36:22.020
I mean, the lettuce is obviously always alive or whatever.

36:22.020 --> 36:24.020
When does the bacon stop being a pig

36:24.020 --> 36:26.020
and become an alive piece of bacon?

36:26.020 --> 36:29.020
And is it before it's sliced into bacon?

36:29.020 --> 36:31.020
Does it know it was sliced into bacon?

36:31.020 --> 36:34.020
A hot dog is a conglomeration of a bunch of different meats

36:34.020 --> 36:35.020
and ingredients.

36:35.020 --> 36:37.020
At what point does that become sentience?

36:37.020 --> 36:40.020
Why isn't the herbs and spices in the hot dog?

36:40.020 --> 36:41.020
Are they dead?

36:41.020 --> 36:43.020
Yeah, there's a hot dog bun.

36:43.020 --> 36:45.020
Is the wheat sentient or is the dough sentient?

36:45.020 --> 36:48.020
And it doesn't know it's getting put into an oven?

36:48.020 --> 36:50.020
I think it's like a rated R comedy.

36:50.020 --> 36:52.020
I'm sure they just make fun of that thing and then they...

36:52.020 --> 36:56.020
If they don't explore that premise and come up with a reason,

36:56.020 --> 36:58.020
I'm going to be so pissed because they could

36:58.020 --> 36:59.020
and it would probably be awesome.

36:59.020 --> 37:00.020
But I bet they'll just say,

37:00.020 --> 37:01.020
oh, that's just part of the conceit.

37:01.020 --> 37:02.020
You've got to accept it.

37:02.020 --> 37:04.020
And I will not.

37:04.020 --> 37:06.020
Ha, ha, ha!

37:08.020 --> 37:10.020
Shots fired, sausage party.

37:10.020 --> 37:12.020
But it's probably going to be great.

37:12.020 --> 37:15.020
I mean, I saw the one... I don't care for the ad campaign.

37:15.020 --> 37:17.020
I saw one there was a female taco

37:17.020 --> 37:20.020
and she's got like little sexy legs

37:20.020 --> 37:23.020
and like a hand on her hip, on her taco shell hip.

37:23.020 --> 37:26.020
And it says she likes fish and beef.

37:26.020 --> 37:28.020
Beef and fish.

37:28.020 --> 37:31.020
She's a bisexual taco? Great.

37:31.020 --> 37:34.020
But the fish part is like...

37:34.020 --> 37:36.020
They call it a fish taco, right?

37:36.020 --> 37:39.020
So it's like she's eating out herself?

37:39.020 --> 37:40.020
Kind of?

37:40.020 --> 37:41.020
Yeah.

37:41.020 --> 37:42.020
It's just me.

37:42.020 --> 37:43.020
I don't know.

37:43.020 --> 37:45.020
I don't like it.

37:45.020 --> 37:46.020
Ain't going to see it.

37:46.020 --> 37:47.020
Maybe you guys should go see it, you know?

37:47.020 --> 37:48.020
Oh, I'll see it.

37:48.020 --> 37:49.020
It'll be great.

37:49.020 --> 37:51.020
Dan, did we discuss why Cody hates Seth Rogen so much?

37:51.020 --> 37:53.020
Why does her fucking problem with Seth Rogen?

37:53.020 --> 37:55.020
Stop that.

37:55.020 --> 37:57.020
No one hates Seth Rogen.

37:57.020 --> 38:00.020
He's worth billions of dollars.

38:00.020 --> 38:02.020
Why didn't we get him on the podcast?

38:02.020 --> 38:03.020
Oh, yeah.

38:03.020 --> 38:04.020
We were just saying that.

38:04.020 --> 38:05.020
It's not going to be as a weird douche

38:05.020 --> 38:06.020
in a plane that goes like,

38:06.020 --> 38:08.020
okay, come on, fuck it.

38:08.020 --> 38:09.020
I bet Seth Rogen sits there and he goes,

38:09.020 --> 38:11.020
this is Dan Harmon sitting over there.

38:11.020 --> 38:12.020
And this guy's not even going to look at me.

38:12.020 --> 38:14.020
He's not even going to ask me to come be on Harmontown?

38:14.020 --> 38:17.020
Well, I think he'd be pretty grateful that I didn't bug him.

38:17.020 --> 38:19.020
Maybe he didn't just get whisked out of the airport.

38:19.020 --> 38:24.020
Maybe he ran because he was so ashamed.

38:24.020 --> 38:26.020
He probably has a lot of stuff going on, I think.

38:26.020 --> 38:27.020
What do you have to do?

38:27.020 --> 38:28.020
At what point is your career so awesome

38:28.020 --> 38:30.020
that you get Seth Rogen airport status?

38:30.020 --> 38:31.020
You have to be Seth Rogen.

38:31.020 --> 38:34.020
He's been worth like a billion dollars.

38:34.020 --> 38:37.020
What's the low end of that thing?

38:37.020 --> 38:38.020
What's the threshold you have?

38:38.020 --> 38:39.020
Oh, yeah.

38:39.020 --> 38:40.020
I don't know.

38:40.020 --> 38:41.020
It's probably like DL Hugley or something.

38:41.020 --> 38:42.020
Yeah, yeah.

38:42.020 --> 38:43.020
That's all I was going to say.

38:43.020 --> 38:45.020
I think probably there's like a threshold

38:45.020 --> 38:47.020
you cross right around Hugley level.

38:47.020 --> 38:48.020
Yeah.

38:48.020 --> 38:49.020
Yeah.

38:49.020 --> 38:51.020
Where like maybe like an old person comes

38:51.020 --> 38:53.020
and meets you at the gate and kind of takes you

38:53.020 --> 38:56.020
to like a slightly shorter taxi line.

38:56.020 --> 38:59.020
Did I ever tell Harmontown how I was on the plane

38:59.020 --> 39:01.020
with George Takei, Sulu from Star Trek?

39:01.020 --> 39:02.020
Did I ever tell him?

39:02.020 --> 39:03.020
Yeah.

39:03.020 --> 39:04.020
Oh my.

39:04.020 --> 39:05.020
Yeah.

39:05.020 --> 39:06.020
You never feel safer in your life

39:06.020 --> 39:08.020
when you got Sulu on the plane?

39:08.020 --> 39:11.020
I had to stop following him on Twitter

39:11.020 --> 39:13.020
because he has like a little cottage industry

39:13.020 --> 39:15.020
of like retweeting stuff and then you click.

39:15.020 --> 39:17.020
It's all bad jokes too.

39:17.020 --> 39:18.020
It's not great.

39:18.020 --> 39:20.020
An ad supported like shit fills your screen

39:20.020 --> 39:22.020
and like oh my.

39:22.020 --> 39:26.020
Isn't he mad about the gay Sulu?

39:26.020 --> 39:28.020
Like the openly gay Sulu in that movie?

39:28.020 --> 39:30.020
Wasn't he like mad about it?

39:30.020 --> 39:31.020
I don't know even what you're talking about.

39:31.020 --> 39:33.020
Oh, there's a new Star Trek movie.

39:33.020 --> 39:35.020
There's a new Sulu.

39:35.020 --> 39:38.020
He's openly gay in the character.

39:38.020 --> 39:39.020
And he doesn't like it?

39:39.020 --> 39:41.020
I don't think George Takei likes it.

39:41.020 --> 39:42.020
I guess I could understand that

39:42.020 --> 39:44.020
because he'd be going well, I'm an actor.

39:44.020 --> 39:45.020
I played a character.

39:45.020 --> 39:47.020
Like why are you making him gay?

39:47.020 --> 39:50.020
Just like a nod to my sexuality as a real person?

39:50.020 --> 39:51.020
Yeah.

39:51.020 --> 39:52.020
I guess I kind of get that.

39:52.020 --> 39:53.020
But on the other hand,

39:53.020 --> 39:54.020
I can understand them thinking

39:54.020 --> 39:56.020
he's going to be stoked about this

39:56.020 --> 39:58.020
because he had to be in the closet back then

39:58.020 --> 40:00.020
while he was like a huge star

40:00.020 --> 40:02.020
and that was like probably really unfair and painful.

40:02.020 --> 40:03.020
So in their minds,

40:03.020 --> 40:05.020
they're probably like this is sort of

40:05.020 --> 40:07.020
a little bit of a restitution, you know?

40:07.020 --> 40:09.020
It's like a doffing of the cap,

40:09.020 --> 40:10.020
an apology almost.

40:10.020 --> 40:12.020
So I can understand how there's two heroes

40:12.020 --> 40:14.020
in that story and they're both each other's villains.

40:14.020 --> 40:15.020
Isn't that something?

40:15.020 --> 40:16.020
Well, that's just the world, man.

40:16.020 --> 40:18.020
That's the world we live in.

40:18.020 --> 40:20.020
What if dichotomy was too limited

40:20.020 --> 40:21.020
for the human experience?

40:21.020 --> 40:23.020
What if everything happened in a continuum

40:23.020 --> 40:25.020
that ate itself, you know?

40:25.020 --> 40:28.020
Like what if you shouldn't have to choose

40:28.020 --> 40:31.020
between I heard a guy on public radio,

40:31.020 --> 40:34.020
some Democrat guy that was like pumping people up

40:34.020 --> 40:37.020
for Hillary Clinton and he was like

40:37.020 --> 40:39.020
in between applause swells.

40:39.020 --> 40:41.020
He was like, I don't know who it was

40:41.020 --> 40:42.020
because it was radio.

40:42.020 --> 40:43.020
I couldn't see him in him.

40:43.020 --> 40:45.020
But he was like,

40:45.020 --> 40:49.020
now I know our candidate isn't perfect.

40:49.020 --> 40:50.020
Yeah.

40:50.020 --> 40:53.020
But what do you say?

40:53.020 --> 40:56.020
But it's about not voting for Trump,

40:56.020 --> 40:57.020
basically is what he said.

40:57.020 --> 40:58.020
And it was like,

40:58.020 --> 41:00.020
that's the fucking scam in a nutshell.

41:00.020 --> 41:02.020
It's just fucking sucks.

41:02.020 --> 41:04.020
And it's really not limited to America.

41:04.020 --> 41:06.020
It's just magnified there.

41:06.020 --> 41:10.020
It's such a scam that we've turned elections

41:10.020 --> 41:13.020
into how much you hate someone else.

41:13.020 --> 41:16.020
And so that's just an easy way to get nothing done

41:16.020 --> 41:17.020
because everyone's like,

41:17.020 --> 41:19.020
oh, don't vote for that other person.

41:19.020 --> 41:21.020
There's always someone worse to vote for.

41:21.020 --> 41:23.020
In fact, there's only one person

41:23.020 --> 41:25.020
that's worse or better to vote for.

41:25.020 --> 41:26.020
And it's like, you have to choose.

41:26.020 --> 41:30.020
But it's a dumb crap if I can want to smash my brains

41:30.020 --> 41:31.020
in with a hammer.

41:31.020 --> 41:34.020
I can only threaten suicide now verbally

41:34.020 --> 41:36.020
because it's probably not legal to say

41:36.020 --> 41:38.020
you want to kill someone else.

41:38.020 --> 41:39.020
It would be taken seriously

41:39.020 --> 41:43.020
because there's a lot of people that deserve to die.

41:43.020 --> 41:45.020
It wouldn't be taken as a joke

41:45.020 --> 41:46.020
because that's a threat

41:46.020 --> 41:48.020
because I would want to kill that person too

41:48.020 --> 41:50.020
but you're not allowed to say it for that reason.

41:50.020 --> 41:53.020
I just want to kill so many people.

41:53.020 --> 41:57.020
I mean, are there people like,

41:57.020 --> 41:59.020
I would imagine a lot of you like,

41:59.020 --> 42:01.020
you're Justin Trudeau, right?

42:01.020 --> 42:02.020
Like, are people like him?

42:02.020 --> 42:04.020
Yeah.

42:04.020 --> 42:08.020
He's so charming and so open-minded and sexy

42:08.020 --> 42:09.020
and kind of adorable.

42:09.020 --> 42:11.020
And he created Dunesbury.

42:11.020 --> 42:12.020
Yeah.

42:12.020 --> 42:15.020
So he's very political.

42:15.020 --> 42:17.020
We know that going in.

42:17.020 --> 42:18.020
He knows about the issues

42:18.020 --> 42:21.020
because he made a political cartoon for many decades.

42:21.020 --> 42:23.020
Dunesbury.

42:23.020 --> 42:25.020
Is it possible to still be a government-hating anarchist

42:25.020 --> 42:26.020
when you're prime minister?

42:26.020 --> 42:28.020
Is that charming and sexy?

42:28.020 --> 42:29.020
Yeah.

42:29.020 --> 42:30.020
Good.

42:30.020 --> 42:31.020
That's what I want to hear.

42:31.020 --> 42:32.020
Probably all the more so

42:32.020 --> 42:33.020
because there's probably an effective level

42:33.020 --> 42:35.020
of lower-level government here

42:35.020 --> 42:36.020
that's probably very, you know,

42:36.020 --> 42:38.020
whether or not it's better than most or not,

42:38.020 --> 42:40.020
but it's probably maybe the issues

42:40.020 --> 42:42.020
they have to deal with here are less like,

42:42.020 --> 42:44.020
there's a lunatic in the White House.

42:44.020 --> 42:46.020
He's going to kill us all.

42:46.020 --> 42:48.020
And more just like,

42:48.020 --> 42:50.020
yeah, but this is bullshit and inefficient

42:50.020 --> 42:52.020
and it kind of cheats these people out of this or that.

42:52.020 --> 42:53.020
And so it's probably,

42:53.020 --> 42:54.020
you could probably still hate the government

42:54.020 --> 42:57.020
even if you have a good, good prime minister.

42:57.020 --> 42:58.020
Yeah.

42:58.020 --> 42:59.020
Yeah.

42:59.020 --> 43:00.020
Good.

43:00.020 --> 43:01.020
This is hate government.

43:01.020 --> 43:02.020
Not the government.

43:02.020 --> 43:03.020
You can just hate government.

43:03.020 --> 43:04.020
Yeah.

43:04.020 --> 43:05.020
Who wants to be governed?

43:05.020 --> 43:06.020
Why would they have invented government

43:06.020 --> 43:08.020
if anyone liked being governed?

43:08.020 --> 43:09.020
No one's going to ask for it to happen.

43:09.020 --> 43:10.020
They had to make it up.

43:10.020 --> 43:12.020
Like, you need to be governed.

43:12.020 --> 43:13.020
Well, oh, good.

43:13.020 --> 43:14.020
It's a good thing you told me

43:14.020 --> 43:15.020
because I never would have fucking come up

43:15.020 --> 43:17.020
with that idea on my own.

43:17.020 --> 43:19.020
Someone telling me what to do.

43:19.020 --> 43:21.020
It's not something I'd come up with.

43:21.020 --> 43:24.020
I'd rather hang out.

43:24.020 --> 43:25.020
And then I poop,

43:25.020 --> 43:27.020
and I'm like, who's going to move that

43:27.020 --> 43:29.020
somewhere where it stinks less?

43:29.020 --> 43:30.020
We need to, someone governs someone

43:30.020 --> 43:32.020
and get that out of here.

43:32.020 --> 43:34.020
Don't govern me.

43:34.020 --> 43:37.020
I think King Geraldo's doing a pretty bang-up job, though.

43:37.020 --> 43:39.020
He found Al Capone's vault.

43:39.020 --> 43:43.020
I mean, there was nothing in it, but...

43:43.020 --> 43:46.020
Well, I've run out of lack of material.

43:46.020 --> 43:47.020
Is there...

43:47.020 --> 43:49.020
I never had any.

43:49.020 --> 43:51.020
Whatever I didn't have, I've run out of.

43:51.020 --> 43:54.020
Is there an epilogue to the sheets?

43:54.020 --> 43:55.020
You got one first?

43:55.020 --> 43:58.020
I got home and I found some pet spray,

43:58.020 --> 44:00.020
like some fur carpets.

44:00.020 --> 44:04.020
I tried, you know, I...

44:04.020 --> 44:06.020
For somebody who poops himself as often as you,

44:06.020 --> 44:09.020
you should really have some stain stuff.

44:09.020 --> 44:11.020
Yeah, some nature's miracle.

44:11.020 --> 44:15.020
So I got the old sheets back out.

44:15.020 --> 44:17.020
Did the new sheets come out of the laundry?

44:17.020 --> 44:19.020
I didn't poop on them, no.

44:19.020 --> 44:21.020
No, I'm saying the new ones.

44:21.020 --> 44:23.020
Did they come out all right, or do we know?

44:23.020 --> 44:26.020
Oh, I don't know. They teed up for the laundry.

44:26.020 --> 44:28.020
So they're just right now how I'm just chilling

44:28.020 --> 44:30.020
in the laundry basket?

44:30.020 --> 44:32.020
They're not covered in shit.

44:32.020 --> 44:35.020
It's not like the Manson murders,

44:35.020 --> 44:37.020
but everything's brown instead of red.

44:37.020 --> 44:42.020
It's a little skid mark, okay?

44:42.020 --> 44:44.020
It's like a little...

44:44.020 --> 44:47.020
I coughed.

44:47.020 --> 44:51.020
I coughed and I had been drinking soylent a lot.

44:51.020 --> 44:53.020
Is my girlfriend still out there?

44:53.020 --> 44:55.020
Did she just leave?

44:55.020 --> 44:57.020
She's back in Los Angeles.

44:57.020 --> 44:59.020
She did leave.

44:59.020 --> 45:01.020
Maybe she had to go poop.

45:01.020 --> 45:04.020
I go to the back of the room and there's just a note.

45:04.020 --> 45:06.020
A letter.

45:06.020 --> 45:09.020
Just for laughs, a letterhead that I can use

45:09.020 --> 45:11.020
to get back into America.

45:11.020 --> 45:14.020
You don't need that to get back though, right?

45:14.020 --> 45:18.020
Usually there's just a bunch of ATM-style machines, right?

45:18.020 --> 45:20.020
When you're coming back.

45:20.020 --> 45:23.020
I can't remember now.

45:23.020 --> 45:25.020
I've only dealt with these big ATM...

45:25.020 --> 45:27.020
That's the American way.

45:27.020 --> 45:31.020
Don't use free paper and pens that you borrow from people.

45:31.020 --> 45:35.020
Buy 18, $10,000 machines

45:35.020 --> 45:38.020
and just put them in a row and let them sort it out.

45:38.020 --> 45:41.020
Every three months they'll become obsolete

45:41.020 --> 45:44.020
and you'll have a no-bid contract with whoever makes those machines.

45:44.020 --> 45:46.020
The American way.

45:46.020 --> 45:50.020
Let that shit trickle down to Quebec.

45:50.020 --> 45:53.020
Fucking global hegemony.

45:53.020 --> 45:56.020
If you guys are so smart, why aren't you rich?

45:56.020 --> 45:58.020
Why don't you have missiles?

45:58.020 --> 46:00.020
That's smart. Have a big missile.

46:00.020 --> 46:04.020
What are your top four favorite provinces in Canada?

46:04.020 --> 46:09.020
I mean, I'm going to eliminate Quebec because we're in Quebec.

46:09.020 --> 46:15.020
I think, you know, in my heart...

46:15.020 --> 46:19.020
I'm a sesquipidutra mom.

46:19.020 --> 46:21.020
You've got to catch them all.

46:21.020 --> 46:23.020
Yeah.

46:23.020 --> 46:26.020
But, you know, everybody always says,

46:26.020 --> 46:28.020
Atamata Pia.

46:28.020 --> 46:31.020
He's so close actually. Are you doing this on purpose?

46:31.020 --> 46:36.020
But I think, and that's two, and I got it, nailed it.

46:36.020 --> 46:39.020
So I'll give you Saskatchewan and Ottawa.

46:39.020 --> 46:47.020
And north of that is Peabody and Helmsman.

46:47.020 --> 46:49.020
Wichita.

46:49.020 --> 46:52.020
I don't know, man. It's a big thing.

46:52.020 --> 46:54.020
It's on all of our maps.

46:54.020 --> 46:57.020
It's just like a big square above the world.

46:57.020 --> 46:59.020
And then it's subdivided into squares.

46:59.020 --> 47:01.020
And they all have these names.

47:01.020 --> 47:05.020
Why does Canada always pink on the maps?

47:05.020 --> 47:07.020
Don't let them panic you.

47:07.020 --> 47:09.020
It's not always pink on the maps.

47:09.020 --> 47:11.020
It's a weird, arbitrary thing for him to say.

47:11.020 --> 47:13.020
It's usually white because it's like,

47:13.020 --> 47:15.020
Oh, it's the North Pole. There's penguins up there.

47:15.020 --> 47:20.020
There's beacons and penguins and no one can invade us.

47:20.020 --> 47:22.020
That's what's important.

47:22.020 --> 47:25.020
The penguins are on the bottom of Earth.

47:25.020 --> 47:28.020
You guys don't have any oil or fresh water, do you?

47:28.020 --> 47:31.020
I'm asking for a friend.

47:31.020 --> 47:33.020
This will not come back to bite you.

47:33.020 --> 47:36.020
Just be honest, how much oil and fresh water do you have?

47:36.020 --> 47:38.020
No.

47:38.020 --> 47:40.020
Sell it all for a few dollars.

47:40.020 --> 47:44.020
Are you guys having bad times economically too?

47:44.020 --> 47:46.020
Up here?

47:46.020 --> 47:48.020
No, not really?

47:48.020 --> 47:50.020
Yes, some said no, some said kind of.

47:50.020 --> 47:53.020
We got the full spectrum on that one.

47:53.020 --> 47:55.020
I've never...

47:55.020 --> 47:58.020
It's my fault or America's fault.

47:58.020 --> 48:02.020
But I'm sure I'm 1,250 millionth to blame if it's...

48:02.020 --> 48:04.020
Is it the subprime mortgage thing?

48:04.020 --> 48:06.020
Is it that thing?

48:06.020 --> 48:09.020
Okay, that didn't affect you guys.

48:09.020 --> 48:11.020
Didn't I put grease out of business?

48:11.020 --> 48:14.020
Now there's swastikas painted everywhere in grease.

48:14.020 --> 48:16.020
There are other banks closed.

48:16.020 --> 48:20.020
Someone talked them into investing in a bunch of American real estate or something.

48:20.020 --> 48:23.020
I don't know from nothing.

48:23.020 --> 48:26.020
That's vodka, don't worry.

48:26.020 --> 48:28.020
It's not spit.

48:28.020 --> 48:30.020
Alright, well let's meet some Montralians.

48:30.020 --> 48:32.020
Let's do it.

48:32.020 --> 48:34.020
Okay, who here...

48:34.020 --> 48:36.020
Let's see.

48:36.020 --> 48:38.020
You guys are so nice and quiet and quiet.

48:38.020 --> 48:40.020
That's so nice.

48:40.020 --> 48:43.020
If this was Chicago and I said let's meet some people, there'd just be...

48:43.020 --> 48:45.020
Who here has a birthday in October

48:45.020 --> 48:48.020
and three people would run up on stage that didn't hear that

48:48.020 --> 48:51.020
and just start confessing to us about their pornography?

48:51.020 --> 48:54.020
Somebody would get punched.

48:54.020 --> 48:56.020
So thank you.

48:56.020 --> 48:58.020
Thank you in advance for that.

48:58.020 --> 49:00.020
But then when you get up here, don't be as nice

49:00.020 --> 49:02.020
because that won't be entertaining.

49:02.020 --> 49:05.020
Have flaws and express them.

49:05.020 --> 49:07.020
Who here...

49:07.020 --> 49:09.020
Let's see.

49:09.020 --> 49:11.020
Who here is an American?

49:11.020 --> 49:13.020
Let's bring up...

49:13.020 --> 49:16.020
Well, let's just bring up somebody that's having a hard time of it

49:16.020 --> 49:18.020
for some reason in particular.

49:18.020 --> 49:22.020
You know, it's having a pretty bad day that made it here in spite of it.

49:22.020 --> 49:26.020
Okay, we got Seth Rogen right in the middle here.

49:26.020 --> 49:28.020
Quebecois, Seth Rogen, everybody.

49:28.020 --> 49:30.020
Let's hear it for...

49:37.020 --> 49:39.020
What's your name, sir?

49:39.020 --> 49:40.020
J.P.

49:40.020 --> 49:42.020
J.P., alright.

49:42.020 --> 49:45.020
Destiny, can you leave my iPad hot so I can play music

49:45.020 --> 49:47.020
from time to time and it keeps going back down.

49:47.020 --> 49:48.020
Sir.

49:48.020 --> 49:49.020
Thank you.

49:49.020 --> 49:50.020
What's your name, sir?

49:50.020 --> 49:51.020
J.P.

49:51.020 --> 49:53.020
Hey, J.P., would you just stand for Jean-Paul?

49:53.020 --> 49:54.020
Jean-Philippe.

49:54.020 --> 49:55.020
Jean-Philippe.

49:55.020 --> 49:56.020
Yes.

49:56.020 --> 49:57.020
Alright.

49:57.020 --> 49:58.020
Sexy.

49:58.020 --> 50:00.020
You're like an undersea explorer.

50:00.020 --> 50:01.020
Bienvenue.

50:01.020 --> 50:02.020
Merci.

50:02.020 --> 50:04.020
Are you Montreal native?

50:04.020 --> 50:06.020
I was born in Montreal but I'm from...

50:06.020 --> 50:07.020
Use your mic.

50:07.020 --> 50:09.020
I'm born in Montreal but I'm from Ottawa.

50:09.020 --> 50:10.020
Ottawa.

50:10.020 --> 50:12.020
Oh, my favorite province.

50:12.020 --> 50:14.020
Ottawa's lovely.

50:14.020 --> 50:17.020
I was there for a couple of days, had a lovely time.

50:17.020 --> 50:18.020
Yes?

50:18.020 --> 50:23.020
Jean-Philippe, would you like a cocktail with a bunch of touched ice?

50:23.020 --> 50:24.020
Sure.

50:24.020 --> 50:25.020
Okay.

50:25.020 --> 50:26.020
Thanks.

50:26.020 --> 50:29.020
I have vodka and touched ice.

50:29.020 --> 50:31.020
There's no cups, huh?

50:31.020 --> 50:32.020
Oh, there is one.

50:32.020 --> 50:34.020
It's kind of just crushed.

50:34.020 --> 50:36.020
It's not cubed, so it's...

50:36.020 --> 50:39.020
So you transferred it in from Ottawa to be here for the festival?

50:39.020 --> 50:41.020
Yes, just for the show.

50:41.020 --> 50:42.020
Just for us?

50:42.020 --> 50:43.020
Yeah.

50:43.020 --> 50:45.020
Are we living up to your standards?

50:45.020 --> 50:46.020
Of course.

50:46.020 --> 50:47.020
And you are on stage.

50:47.020 --> 50:48.020
Fantastic.

50:48.020 --> 50:49.020
Yes.

50:49.020 --> 50:53.020
What's going on that has made you blue, JP?

50:53.020 --> 50:55.020
In March, my girlfriend passed away.

50:55.020 --> 50:56.020
Oh, here.

50:56.020 --> 50:58.020
There you go.

50:58.020 --> 51:03.020
For those of you listening in audio, they laughed because they handed him a drink.

51:03.020 --> 51:05.020
He didn't give him a hug.

51:05.020 --> 51:07.020
It's going to be the weirdest reaction they've had.

51:07.020 --> 51:09.020
My girlfriend passed away.

51:09.020 --> 51:13.020
Oh.

51:13.020 --> 51:14.020
I'm so...

51:14.020 --> 51:16.020
For Dan, vodka is like a hug.

51:16.020 --> 51:17.020
Yes.

51:17.020 --> 51:18.020
How did...

51:18.020 --> 51:19.020
How long ago?

51:19.020 --> 51:20.020
I'm sorry, I didn't get...

51:20.020 --> 51:21.020
In March.

51:21.020 --> 51:22.020
Okay.

51:22.020 --> 51:25.020
And did we ask what caused?

51:25.020 --> 51:28.020
Pulmonary embolism caused by ambiotic fluid.

51:28.020 --> 51:29.020
Oh, Jesus.

51:29.020 --> 51:30.020
So it was no warning at all.

51:30.020 --> 51:32.020
She was pregnant.

51:32.020 --> 51:33.020
Oh.

51:33.020 --> 51:34.020
All right.

51:34.020 --> 51:37.020
Good night, folks.

51:37.020 --> 51:40.020
Just for tears festival.

51:40.020 --> 51:41.020
Holy smoke.

51:41.020 --> 51:42.020
Yeah.

51:42.020 --> 51:43.020
How old was she?

51:43.020 --> 51:44.020
32.

51:44.020 --> 51:45.020
And so that just came out of the...

51:45.020 --> 51:46.020
Out of nowhere.

51:46.020 --> 51:47.020
So you're...

51:47.020 --> 51:52.020
You're as put together about this and able to share this without a crack in the veneer

51:52.020 --> 51:53.020
because it's just...

51:53.020 --> 51:54.020
It's absolutely necessary.

51:54.020 --> 51:56.020
You had to deal with it and you're just...

51:56.020 --> 51:58.020
You're a brick wall right now.

51:58.020 --> 51:59.020
Try my best.

51:59.020 --> 52:00.020
Yeah.

52:00.020 --> 52:02.020
And so what happens...

52:02.020 --> 52:06.020
After that happens, like in terms of like, do you keep to yourself?

52:06.020 --> 52:10.020
Everyone's like flooding you with emails and phone calls and things.

52:10.020 --> 52:11.020
Do you want to be alone?

52:11.020 --> 52:12.020
It's more or less.

52:12.020 --> 52:16.020
I think what happens is that I immediately afterwards you get like sort of...

52:16.020 --> 52:19.020
It's like a tsunami.

52:19.020 --> 52:20.020
It just hits you.

52:20.020 --> 52:21.020
You have like no repair.

52:21.020 --> 52:23.020
Like you have no idea what's going on.

52:23.020 --> 52:25.020
You're constantly surrounded by people.

52:25.020 --> 52:28.020
And then after one point, like everybody's gone.

52:28.020 --> 52:32.020
Like you have your family, you have your close friends, but then you sort of realize sort

52:32.020 --> 52:35.020
of the extent of the damage.

52:35.020 --> 52:38.020
Meaning that you say...

52:38.020 --> 52:42.020
The tsunami is referring to a bunch of people flooding you with condolences and...

52:42.020 --> 52:45.020
The condolences and also the fact like she passed away.

52:45.020 --> 52:46.020
Like it comes out of nowhere.

52:46.020 --> 52:48.020
Like it sort of just hits you.

52:48.020 --> 52:54.020
And it's probably, I would imagine, it's probably timed right so that just when you might actually

52:54.020 --> 53:03.020
need some like sympathy, it's probably timed just after everyone is kind of like,

53:03.020 --> 53:05.020
Okay, I did my part.

53:05.020 --> 53:06.020
Yeah, pretty much.

53:06.020 --> 53:07.020
That's pretty much.

53:07.020 --> 53:11.020
You awaken to this tragedy after your body has protected you through numbness and stuff.

53:11.020 --> 53:16.020
And you regain sensitivity and then you're largely alone.

53:16.020 --> 53:19.020
And as you said, you're surveying the damage.

53:19.020 --> 53:21.020
Like what is...

53:21.020 --> 53:26.020
Give us a detail, not about the event.

53:26.020 --> 53:28.020
I think it's too ghoulish to...

53:28.020 --> 53:33.020
But about the loss, about afterword.

53:33.020 --> 53:38.020
Like I don't know, paperwork or like what is...

53:38.020 --> 53:52.020
When you're married and then you lose your partner, like what is the worst like non-emotional inconvenience?

53:52.020 --> 53:54.020
I think pretty much the paperwork is...

53:54.020 --> 53:55.020
You have so much paperwork to fill up.

53:55.020 --> 53:56.020
It's amazing.

53:56.020 --> 54:02.020
The insurance for the hospital and everything, everything you have to deal with.

54:02.020 --> 54:05.020
It's like, it's a non-stop barrage of paperwork.

54:05.020 --> 54:08.020
And I snap a few times that people on the phone won't have to fill up and they're like,

54:08.020 --> 54:10.020
Oh yeah, the doctor needs to fill that stop on.

54:10.020 --> 54:15.020
I just call them up and like, motherfucker, just leave me be for just five minutes alone.

54:15.020 --> 54:18.020
Yeah, that was just about to ask that before you said it.

54:18.020 --> 54:25.020
Like you must several times a day or a week, like you must just explode into a righteous outrage.

54:25.020 --> 54:28.020
Because you're talking to someone that's just like...

54:28.020 --> 54:34.020
Oh, you have to fill out a Z stroke 9-2 and they're not even...

54:34.020 --> 54:39.020
You have to remind them why this is happening and what's going on.

54:39.020 --> 54:44.020
Oh yeah, a few times you have to call like, for example, like, I don't know,

54:44.020 --> 54:49.020
like her phone company and they're like, tell them like, we have to cancel her contract.

54:49.020 --> 54:50.020
And they're like, Oh, what's the reason?

54:50.020 --> 54:56.020
And it's like, well, she passed away and like you just hear their enthusiasm just drop.

54:56.020 --> 55:01.020
Sort of like in the room way and when I announce what happened, like the same thing, like...

55:01.020 --> 55:05.020
Well, it sort of feel bad that like you invite somebody, oh, here it's not feeling well.

55:05.020 --> 55:08.020
Enthusiasm dropping is a negative way of putting it.

55:08.020 --> 55:15.020
I think it's them like opening up to, you know, they're like, Oh, I need to be on alert.

55:15.020 --> 55:17.020
I'm not going to trample all around us.

55:17.020 --> 55:20.020
I'm going to like be careful now and like...

55:20.020 --> 55:22.020
How long did you know her?

55:22.020 --> 55:23.020
10 years.

55:23.020 --> 55:24.020
And you're married for how long?

55:24.020 --> 55:25.020
Oh, we were not married.

55:25.020 --> 55:26.020
Oh, sorry.

55:26.020 --> 55:28.020
No, it was like a common law couple.

55:28.020 --> 55:29.020
Pardon?

55:29.020 --> 55:30.020
Common law.

55:30.020 --> 55:31.020
Wow.

55:31.020 --> 55:33.020
Did you have any...

55:33.020 --> 55:39.020
Do you have any moments when you do one of those snaps where you like shut somebody down

55:39.020 --> 55:42.020
or just like go into a Sam Jackson monologue?

55:42.020 --> 55:49.020
Do you have any memories of any like choice singers that you just dropped a bomb on somebody

55:49.020 --> 55:50.020
on the phone?

55:50.020 --> 55:51.020
It happened a few times, yes.

55:51.020 --> 55:55.020
Do you remember like your favorite one?

55:55.020 --> 55:58.020
It's mostly like people when they talk about it.

55:58.020 --> 56:06.020
Yeah, trying to recall, but it's such a blur right now, but it's mostly like...

56:06.020 --> 56:07.020
How long ago did you say it happened?

56:07.020 --> 56:08.020
I'm sorry.

56:08.020 --> 56:09.020
March 7th.

56:09.020 --> 56:10.020
Wow.

56:10.020 --> 56:15.020
Are you just numb to walk around in kind of a daze?

56:15.020 --> 56:18.020
Have you kind of since come back to you at all?

56:18.020 --> 56:19.020
More or less, yes.

56:19.020 --> 56:20.020
Yeah?

56:20.020 --> 56:23.020
Yeah, like today I was just walking around for a few hours before the show and you do

56:23.020 --> 56:29.020
feel like sometimes you snap back, you snap out and you just relive the moment again and

56:29.020 --> 56:30.020
again and again.

56:30.020 --> 56:33.020
Do you have like a friend or a family member or do you have like any circle of people that

56:33.020 --> 56:34.020
are like...

56:34.020 --> 56:36.020
Like there's been like someone to totally rely on and...

56:36.020 --> 56:37.020
Oh, yes.

56:37.020 --> 56:38.020
Oh, good.

56:38.020 --> 56:39.020
That's awesome.

56:39.020 --> 56:45.020
My first month, my best friend lived with me, so he was very kind and I thanked him for

56:45.020 --> 56:49.020
doing that and I thanked his wife to allow him to spend some time with me and she was

56:49.020 --> 56:52.020
like, super happy.

56:52.020 --> 56:53.020
You can have him.

56:53.020 --> 56:54.020
Oh, yes.

56:54.020 --> 56:57.020
She was like, oh, you can keep it for as long as you want.

56:57.020 --> 56:58.020
Are you sure?

56:58.020 --> 57:00.020
I'm getting so much shit done at the house right now.

57:00.020 --> 57:01.020
It's amazing.

57:01.020 --> 57:02.020
Exactly.

57:02.020 --> 57:03.020
That's what she kept saying.

57:03.020 --> 57:04.020
I get stuff done finally because he's like...

57:04.020 --> 57:05.020
Wow.

57:05.020 --> 57:12.020
How many people this year or within a year or so, how many people out here have lost a

57:12.020 --> 57:15.020
loved one?

57:15.020 --> 57:17.020
There was like a big pause.

57:17.020 --> 57:19.020
You made people clap for that, by the way.

57:19.020 --> 57:22.020
Well, let's hear it, everybody.

57:22.020 --> 57:25.020
Put those hands together for lost loved ones.

57:25.020 --> 57:27.020
Well, they came to a comedy show.

57:27.020 --> 57:30.020
They're probably looking forward to a little levity.

57:30.020 --> 57:34.020
That was less applause than I thought I'd hear.

57:34.020 --> 57:42.020
It must be lonely, not even the sense that you lost a loved one, but it's a lonely experience.

57:42.020 --> 57:45.020
There's not a bunch of people around you that understand what's happening to you.

57:45.020 --> 57:48.020
There was no time to even prepare yourself for it.

57:48.020 --> 57:49.020
It just happened.

57:49.020 --> 57:51.020
It's just the rugs completely pulled out from under you.

57:51.020 --> 57:52.020
Exactly.

57:52.020 --> 57:55.020
My mother passed away and we knew.

57:55.020 --> 58:00.020
It was a process and you emotionally kind of get ready for that.

58:00.020 --> 58:04.020
But I can't imagine if somebody went poof like that.

58:04.020 --> 58:05.020
It's horrifying.

58:05.020 --> 58:08.020
What's the thing that you put yourself into?

58:08.020 --> 58:15.020
What's something that makes you really happy, that you indulge in, that kind of helps you stay?

58:15.020 --> 58:17.020
Well, it takes your mind off of things.

58:17.020 --> 58:23.020
What's something that's just a habit or an indulgence?

58:23.020 --> 58:25.020
Spending time with friends.

58:25.020 --> 58:26.020
That's mostly it.

58:26.020 --> 58:27.020
Just spending time, is that what you said?

58:27.020 --> 58:29.020
Spending time with friends, yes.

58:29.020 --> 58:30.020
What do you do when you spend time with them?

58:30.020 --> 58:31.020
Just chat?

58:31.020 --> 58:33.020
Just chat and talk about stories.

58:33.020 --> 58:37.020
Her name was Mary, so just talk about Mary and stories and share funny stories.

58:37.020 --> 58:40.020
Oh, so you're not taking your mind off it with anything?

58:40.020 --> 58:41.020
Well, more or less.

58:41.020 --> 58:44.020
We're not spending 24 hours just talking about her constantly.

58:44.020 --> 58:47.020
We're just chatting about different things.

58:47.020 --> 58:55.020
So at this point, it's all about remembering and stuff.

58:55.020 --> 58:58.020
So you don't play Minecraft.

58:58.020 --> 59:01.020
I knew you were hoping he was going to say Minecraft.

59:01.020 --> 59:04.020
No, my nephew, he's a big player.

59:04.020 --> 59:05.020
Okay.

59:05.020 --> 59:06.020
Does he play with mod packs?

59:06.020 --> 59:07.020
Yes.

59:07.020 --> 59:09.020
He just recently started playing with mod packs.

59:09.020 --> 59:10.020
Feed the Beast mod packs?

59:10.020 --> 59:11.020
I don't know.

59:11.020 --> 59:12.020
Okay.

59:12.020 --> 59:14.020
Is he here tonight?

59:14.020 --> 59:16.020
Is he in the audience?

59:16.020 --> 59:17.020
No, he's not here, right?

59:17.020 --> 59:18.020
No, no, he's not here.

59:18.020 --> 59:19.020
Okay.

59:19.020 --> 59:24.020
Because I found a bug in the Feed the Beast unstable mod pack.

59:24.020 --> 59:28.020
If you take an Iron Bucket up to an Ender IO...

59:28.020 --> 59:30.020
This is how Dan deals with grief, everybody.

59:30.020 --> 59:34.020
Just pass this on to everything into a Minecraft conversation.

59:34.020 --> 59:36.020
Dan, it's okay to cry.

59:36.020 --> 59:38.020
Well, I'm not...

59:38.020 --> 59:41.020
Yeah, I mean, I have no idea how I'll deal with death.

59:41.020 --> 59:42.020
I mean, it's terrifying.

59:42.020 --> 59:43.020
Me neither.

59:43.020 --> 59:45.020
I'm really actually...

59:45.020 --> 59:50.020
I'm in denial about my denial, about my denial of death.

59:50.020 --> 59:53.020
Like, it hasn't been put to the test at all yet.

59:53.020 --> 59:56.020
And now I feel like there's no wood to knock on and all this stuff.

59:56.020 --> 59:58.020
And I just like, yeah, I can't even...

59:58.020 --> 01:00:04.020
I've been so lucky and so untouched by that side of reality.

01:00:04.020 --> 01:00:06.020
And I just can't...

01:00:06.020 --> 01:00:14.020
I'm gonna show the world the new definition of pussy when anything bad happens to me.

01:00:14.020 --> 01:00:21.020
Like, I'm gonna be up on my roof wailing at the moon for six years.

01:00:21.020 --> 01:00:24.020
I felt like doing that sometimes.

01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:26.020
Is there a way to do that?

01:00:26.020 --> 01:00:27.020
Do you have a therapist?

01:00:27.020 --> 01:00:28.020
Yes.

01:00:28.020 --> 01:00:29.020
Are they good?

01:00:29.020 --> 01:00:30.020
Yes.

01:00:30.020 --> 01:00:31.020
I don't know.

01:00:31.020 --> 01:00:33.020
I'm actually seeing two.

01:00:33.020 --> 01:00:34.020
Two of them?

01:00:34.020 --> 01:00:35.020
Did they both know?

01:00:35.020 --> 01:00:37.020
It's like, that's good, that's good.

01:00:37.020 --> 01:00:38.020
Keep them on their toes.

01:00:38.020 --> 01:00:39.020
I like that.

01:00:39.020 --> 01:00:41.020
I always start my therapy sessions,

01:00:41.020 --> 01:00:43.020
but I take them through all the previous therapists

01:00:43.020 --> 01:00:46.020
and like how I fired them, like what I did.

01:00:46.020 --> 01:00:51.020
I caught one of them crying and they lied about it.

01:00:51.020 --> 01:00:53.020
Their eyes were watering and I said,

01:00:53.020 --> 01:00:54.020
why are you crying?

01:00:54.020 --> 01:00:56.020
And they said, because it's such an emotional story.

01:00:56.020 --> 01:00:57.020
I said, no, it's not.

01:00:57.020 --> 01:00:59.020
And because it wasn't.

01:00:59.020 --> 01:01:02.020
And then like 20 minutes later, the therapist said,

01:01:02.020 --> 01:01:04.020
I'm sorry, I feel really bad.

01:01:04.020 --> 01:01:06.020
I had eye surgery recently.

01:01:06.020 --> 01:01:08.020
Cosmetic eye surgery.

01:01:08.020 --> 01:01:10.020
So my eyes are watering.

01:01:10.020 --> 01:01:15.020
So my instinct was to lie about it.

01:01:15.020 --> 01:01:18.020
Okay, good session.

01:01:18.020 --> 01:01:22.020
So go out there and be a good person then.

01:01:22.020 --> 01:01:24.020
Take two of these, call you in the morning.

01:01:24.020 --> 01:01:26.020
They're supposed to pay you at that point for that breakthrough.

01:01:26.020 --> 01:01:27.020
Yeah, yeah.

01:01:27.020 --> 01:01:29.020
So I just never went back anyways.

01:01:29.020 --> 01:01:32.020
But yeah, and I always tell that story to my new therapist

01:01:32.020 --> 01:01:34.020
that I'm like laying down the law.

01:01:34.020 --> 01:01:36.020
I'm like, you better fix my head.

01:01:36.020 --> 01:01:38.020
And you better be good.

01:01:38.020 --> 01:01:42.020
I'm like saw, like when he has that doctor come in

01:01:42.020 --> 01:01:46.020
and give him craniectomy, because he's got like some kind of thing.

01:01:46.020 --> 01:01:48.020
And he's like, I'm like saw.

01:01:48.020 --> 01:01:50.020
Okay.

01:01:50.020 --> 01:01:52.020
There's like nine saw movies.

01:01:52.020 --> 01:01:54.020
Now can I ask you just like a crash question?

01:01:54.020 --> 01:01:56.020
Like is that state health care stuff?

01:01:56.020 --> 01:02:00.020
Like you get that as a Canadian, you get therapy.

01:02:00.020 --> 01:02:02.020
It's part of your...

01:02:02.020 --> 01:02:04.020
No, it's through my employer.

01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:05.020
Okay.

01:02:05.020 --> 01:02:06.020
All right.

01:02:06.020 --> 01:02:07.020
So now you stay here, Sean Philipp.

01:02:07.020 --> 01:02:08.020
Okay.

01:02:08.020 --> 01:02:12.020
So who's having like a fantastic...

01:02:12.020 --> 01:02:17.020
Let's go for gender balance.

01:02:17.020 --> 01:02:19.020
I see a young lady raising her hand.

01:02:19.020 --> 01:02:20.020
You back here.

01:02:20.020 --> 01:02:21.020
Let's get a woman up here.

01:02:21.020 --> 01:02:22.020
What's your name, ma'am?

01:02:22.020 --> 01:02:23.020
Shayna.

01:02:23.020 --> 01:02:24.020
Mademoiselle Shayna, everybody.

01:02:24.020 --> 01:02:25.020
Welcome Shayna up here.

01:02:25.020 --> 01:02:26.020
All right.

01:02:34.020 --> 01:02:36.020
He's moving down a stool.

01:02:36.020 --> 01:02:39.020
You instinctively applied Carson rules.

01:02:39.020 --> 01:02:44.020
Like proximity to me is like the important thing.

01:02:44.020 --> 01:02:46.020
He just moved over like Ed McMahon.

01:02:46.020 --> 01:02:48.020
Shayna, you're looking very smart and vintage.

01:02:48.020 --> 01:02:50.020
I like your outfit there.

01:02:50.020 --> 01:02:51.020
Thank you.

01:02:51.020 --> 01:02:52.020
Oh, thank you.

01:02:52.020 --> 01:02:53.020
Where are you from, Shayna?

01:02:53.020 --> 01:02:54.020
I'm from Texas.

01:02:54.020 --> 01:02:55.020
No shame?

01:02:55.020 --> 01:02:56.020
Yeah.

01:02:56.020 --> 01:02:57.020
What part of Texas?

01:02:57.020 --> 01:02:59.020
West Texas, the dirt round shitty part of Texas.

01:02:59.020 --> 01:03:00.020
West Texas?

01:03:00.020 --> 01:03:01.020
Yeah.

01:03:01.020 --> 01:03:02.020
Like the city of West Texas?

01:03:02.020 --> 01:03:03.020
No, Lubbock.

01:03:03.020 --> 01:03:04.020
No, Lubbock.

01:03:04.020 --> 01:03:05.020
Lubbock.

01:03:05.020 --> 01:03:06.020
No.

01:03:06.020 --> 01:03:08.020
You know, the typewriter was invented in Texas.

01:03:08.020 --> 01:03:09.020
Was it?

01:03:09.020 --> 01:03:10.020
Yes.

01:03:10.020 --> 01:03:11.020
That's exciting.

01:03:11.020 --> 01:03:13.020
And the president of Texas is a lady.

01:03:13.020 --> 01:03:14.020
Did you know that?

01:03:14.020 --> 01:03:15.020
It's only.

01:03:15.020 --> 01:03:17.020
And it's the shape of a boot.

01:03:17.020 --> 01:03:18.020
Yes.

01:03:18.020 --> 01:03:19.020
Yep.

01:03:19.020 --> 01:03:20.020
That sounds right.

01:03:20.020 --> 01:03:21.020
Okay.

01:03:21.020 --> 01:03:23.020
So why are you so happy?

01:03:23.020 --> 01:03:25.020
Don't you know this guy's wife died?

01:03:25.020 --> 01:03:27.020
I'm very sorry.

01:03:27.020 --> 01:03:29.020
How do you know you're a problem lady?

01:03:29.020 --> 01:03:30.020
I'm a sociopath.

01:03:30.020 --> 01:03:31.020
That's why I'm happy.

01:03:31.020 --> 01:03:32.020
No.

01:03:32.020 --> 01:03:34.020
So I'm actually here with my boyfriend.

01:03:34.020 --> 01:03:36.020
It's between our birthdays.

01:03:36.020 --> 01:03:38.020
So this was our birthday present.

01:03:38.020 --> 01:03:40.020
Do you guys, how close are your birthdays?

01:03:40.020 --> 01:03:42.020
His is on the 13th of July.

01:03:42.020 --> 01:03:44.020
Mine's on the 4th of August.

01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:45.020
Okay.

01:03:45.020 --> 01:03:50.020
So you guys have agreed to, because your birthdays are relatively close, you've merged them into

01:03:50.020 --> 01:03:51.020
a by birthday?

01:03:51.020 --> 01:03:52.020
No.

01:03:52.020 --> 01:03:53.020
No, no.

01:03:53.020 --> 01:03:55.020
It was just that I wanted to come here for my birthday and he wanted to be here for

01:03:55.020 --> 01:03:56.020
his birthday.

01:03:56.020 --> 01:03:57.020
So here we are.

01:03:57.020 --> 01:03:59.020
My show specifically, right?

01:03:59.020 --> 01:04:00.020
Yes.

01:04:00.020 --> 01:04:01.020
That was a lie.

01:04:01.020 --> 01:04:02.020
No.

01:04:02.020 --> 01:04:03.020
Okay.

01:04:03.020 --> 01:04:04.020
I know.

01:04:04.020 --> 01:04:05.020
I know.

01:04:05.020 --> 01:04:06.020
Okay.

01:04:06.020 --> 01:04:07.020
I listened to your show.

01:04:07.020 --> 01:04:08.020
I'm aware.

01:04:08.020 --> 01:04:09.020
I'm sorry.

01:04:09.020 --> 01:04:10.020
Don't apologize, Hannah.

01:04:10.020 --> 01:04:11.020
Don't apologize.

01:04:11.020 --> 01:04:12.020
There's no apology necessary.

01:04:12.020 --> 01:04:13.020
You're not Canadian.

01:04:13.020 --> 01:04:14.020
You're a Texan.

01:04:14.020 --> 01:04:26.020
Tell me you'll leave if I don't give you enough money.

01:04:26.020 --> 01:04:29.020
See, I actually, I have a custom story.

01:04:29.020 --> 01:04:30.020
Okay.

01:04:30.020 --> 01:04:34.020
So I met a man on World of Warcraft.

01:04:34.020 --> 01:04:35.020
You wait.

01:04:35.020 --> 01:04:36.020
I'm sorry.

01:04:36.020 --> 01:04:37.020
You met a man on World of Warcraft?

01:04:37.020 --> 01:04:38.020
I did.

01:04:38.020 --> 01:04:39.020
Yes.

01:04:39.020 --> 01:04:40.020
Does your boyfriend know about this man?

01:04:40.020 --> 01:04:41.020
Yeah.

01:04:41.020 --> 01:04:42.020
He's aware.

01:04:42.020 --> 01:04:43.020
Okay.

01:04:43.020 --> 01:04:44.020
Okay.

01:04:44.020 --> 01:04:45.020
This was a long time ago.

01:04:45.020 --> 01:04:46.020
This was around eight years ago, something like that.

01:04:46.020 --> 01:04:47.020
Okay.

01:04:47.020 --> 01:04:53.020
So he's French-Canadian and we decided to elope, but when I came through customs, they thought

01:04:53.020 --> 01:04:59.020
I was a mail order bride because my ex-husband is much older than me.

01:04:59.020 --> 01:05:01.580
And so they just put us through the ringer.

01:05:01.580 --> 01:05:05.580
Every time I went through customs, like I get pulled aside with the immigrants for three

01:05:05.580 --> 01:05:07.520
hours and I have to wait.

01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:09.680
They take me into a room and they grill me.

01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:11.220
This is Canadian customs, by the way.

01:05:11.220 --> 01:05:12.220
This isn't US customs.

01:05:12.220 --> 01:05:17.860
So they thought you were marrying a Canadian to become a Canadian?

01:05:17.860 --> 01:05:18.860
I think so.

01:05:18.860 --> 01:05:19.860
Yeah.

01:05:19.860 --> 01:05:20.860
Who does that?

01:05:20.860 --> 01:05:21.860
I don't know.

01:05:21.860 --> 01:05:24.020
It's going to happen a lot in November.

01:05:24.020 --> 01:05:25.020
Yeah.

01:05:25.020 --> 01:05:27.220
A lot of people will be doing that.

01:05:27.220 --> 01:05:28.220
Is that even necessary?

01:05:28.220 --> 01:05:30.620
I thought that was like...

01:05:30.620 --> 01:05:32.260
It seems that there's a black market.

01:05:32.260 --> 01:05:36.620
You pay about $300,000 for the healthcare card because when you immigrate here...

01:05:36.620 --> 01:05:37.620
Oh, the healthcare thing.

01:05:37.620 --> 01:05:38.620
Yes.

01:05:38.620 --> 01:05:39.620
Of course.

01:05:39.620 --> 01:05:41.500
So there are people trying to come up here and get pharmaceuticals and stuff.

01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:45.220
Well, you'll have people that have cancer and cancer is so expensive to treat in the

01:05:45.220 --> 01:05:48.300
US that you come to Canada and it's much more manageable.

01:05:48.300 --> 01:05:52.180
And all you have to do is marry some schmuck and pay...

01:05:52.180 --> 01:05:53.500
What a mind-fuck that is.

01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:55.180
Like, oh, there's cancer.

01:05:55.180 --> 01:05:57.460
Cancer and cancer is so expensive.

01:05:57.460 --> 01:05:59.180
What's the fucking mind-fuck?

01:05:59.180 --> 01:06:01.620
What the fuck?

01:06:01.620 --> 01:06:02.900
Did we kill God?

01:06:02.900 --> 01:06:04.700
What is wrong with us?

01:06:04.700 --> 01:06:06.980
Cancer is so expensive in America.

01:06:06.980 --> 01:06:08.780
It's like the worst place to get cancer.

01:06:08.780 --> 01:06:10.740
What the fuck is wrong with us?

01:06:10.740 --> 01:06:13.300
It's the easiest place and the worst place.

01:06:13.300 --> 01:06:14.300
Yeah.

01:06:14.300 --> 01:06:16.860
Because it's probably Wi-Fi, right?

01:06:16.860 --> 01:06:18.780
Wi-Fi has given it to all of us.

01:06:18.780 --> 01:06:20.500
I blame the Wi-Fi, yeah.

01:06:20.500 --> 01:06:26.900
So it's that time we crossed with customs, it took us seven days and three attempts

01:06:26.900 --> 01:06:29.700
to get across the border to Canada.

01:06:29.700 --> 01:06:31.340
So there are three attempts.

01:06:31.340 --> 01:06:32.820
So what is a failed attempt like?

01:06:32.820 --> 01:06:39.380
They go like, you don't love him, you just want a Band-Aid and then they just...

01:06:39.380 --> 01:06:42.340
Get out of here and you just go and then you try to come back in.

01:06:42.340 --> 01:06:47.500
They turn you around, there's like a mile between the two customs, they turn you around

01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:51.860
and you have to go back through US customs and explain why you were turned around at

01:06:51.860 --> 01:06:53.860
the Canadian border.

01:06:53.860 --> 01:06:57.900
And that's really awkward because when you come back through, they're like, what the fuck

01:06:57.900 --> 01:06:59.500
are you doing here?

01:06:59.500 --> 01:07:02.460
And then you're like, oh, well, they turned us around and they're like, really?

01:07:02.460 --> 01:07:03.460
Yeah.

01:07:03.460 --> 01:07:04.460
Why?

01:07:04.460 --> 01:07:05.460
What if they know that we don't know?

01:07:05.460 --> 01:07:06.460
Yeah.

01:07:06.460 --> 01:07:08.260
If they don't like you, why should we like you?

01:07:08.260 --> 01:07:11.100
And the second time, it's always the same customs we tried.

01:07:11.100 --> 01:07:14.420
So the second time we came back over, they're like, oh, it's you again, huh?

01:07:14.420 --> 01:07:20.140
And they're like, don't worry, Canadian customs is really shitty, but you're okay with us.

01:07:20.140 --> 01:07:26.260
You're always welcome back into the United States, and yeah, I know, it's really weird.

01:07:26.260 --> 01:07:29.060
It's always been Canadian customs that's been a problem for me, I don't know.

01:07:29.060 --> 01:07:30.060
Shayna, can I ask you a question?

01:07:30.060 --> 01:07:31.060
Sure.

01:07:31.060 --> 01:07:32.060
Are you a drug mule?

01:07:32.060 --> 01:07:33.060
No.

01:07:33.060 --> 01:07:34.060
No?

01:07:34.060 --> 01:07:35.060
Okay.

01:07:35.060 --> 01:07:36.060
No.

01:07:36.060 --> 01:07:37.060
Are you holding?

01:07:37.060 --> 01:07:38.060
No.

01:07:38.060 --> 01:07:42.060
But you're in Montreal, you can find something if you want.

01:07:42.060 --> 01:07:46.260
I want to talk about how do you fall in love with somebody over a world of...

01:07:46.260 --> 01:07:53.500
So we used to raid together a lot, the world of Warcraft by nature is time consuming, and

01:07:53.500 --> 01:07:55.260
it's also very social.

01:07:55.260 --> 01:07:59.780
So you spend a lot of time talking to people, and you work together in raids, and you defeat

01:07:59.780 --> 01:08:07.220
bosses, and that's very kind of dumbing down what WoW is, but so I would spend probably

01:08:07.220 --> 01:08:13.220
eight, nine hours a night with this guy and my guilds doing raids, and you just get to

01:08:13.220 --> 01:08:19.220
know a person over that time, and we started talking on MSM Messenger, this was a long

01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:20.220
time ago.

01:08:20.220 --> 01:08:23.220
And you're like, Leroy Jenkins, I love you.

01:08:23.220 --> 01:08:24.220
Pretty much, yeah.

01:08:24.220 --> 01:08:25.220
Yeah, exactly.

01:08:25.220 --> 01:08:28.220
I would like to be Mrs. Leroy Jenkins.

01:08:28.220 --> 01:08:30.220
Will you make me the happiest?

01:08:30.220 --> 01:08:32.220
At least I'll have chicken.

01:08:32.220 --> 01:08:37.300
But yeah, no, so we met over there, we got to know each other, and then eventually we

01:08:37.300 --> 01:08:42.700
decided to do the intelligent thing by eloping, and then it turned out that that was a bad

01:08:42.700 --> 01:08:43.700
idea.

01:08:43.700 --> 01:08:46.780
How long did that marriage last?

01:08:46.780 --> 01:08:47.780
Almost five years.

01:08:47.780 --> 01:08:48.780
Oh yeah.

01:08:48.780 --> 01:08:49.780
Yeah.

01:08:49.780 --> 01:08:55.780
Divorce is a good thing, like I've changed my position on this recently, and it doesn't

01:08:55.780 --> 01:09:02.420
have anything to do with like, you know, Erin and I had a great, tragically short marriage,

01:09:02.420 --> 01:09:07.380
but not speaking about the marriage and the quality of it, or especially the quality of

01:09:07.380 --> 01:09:15.020
a partner at all, like putting all of that aside, the idea of divorce, it really shocks

01:09:15.020 --> 01:09:20.660
your system into letting go of a bunch of shit you didn't know you were, I always just had

01:09:20.660 --> 01:09:23.780
all these presuppositions I didn't even know I had about how you're supposed to live the

01:09:23.780 --> 01:09:27.060
second half of a full life, like oh, I'm supposed to do this, I'm supposed to do that, and it's

01:09:27.060 --> 01:09:30.660
not that I'm not necessarily going to do those things now, I may get married and have kids

01:09:30.660 --> 01:09:34.540
or something like that, but now I live in this world where I'm like, oh, none of that

01:09:34.540 --> 01:09:39.540
is like a carryover for my Midwestern upbringing, like there's not any like tapes that I'm playing

01:09:39.540 --> 01:09:48.020
in my head that I'm like following the soundtrack of, and I have to imagine, divorce psychologically

01:09:48.020 --> 01:09:51.980
is as beneficial as like coming out of the closet must be for somebody who like comes

01:09:51.980 --> 01:09:56.140
out, like because it's like, okay, I'm not going to care as much about spilling a drink

01:09:56.140 --> 01:10:00.300
at dinner anymore, I'm not going to like freak out, because like I had to tell my parents

01:10:00.300 --> 01:10:05.100
I'm gay, or I had to look at them, I had to tell everyone I invited to my wedding that

01:10:05.100 --> 01:10:08.860
thanks for coming and like witnessing us and like, well, we talked about how in love

01:10:08.860 --> 01:10:13.380
we were and stuff, and we were just kidding, like, and then you, and then you, and then

01:10:13.380 --> 01:10:17.100
they go, that's all right, it was a fun party, thanks for inviting me, I like wearing my

01:10:17.100 --> 01:10:20.540
suit, and then you wake up the next day and you're not dead, and you're like, holy shit,

01:10:20.540 --> 01:10:26.180
I can do like, what's my favorite color, I don't know, maybe I should have one, I hate,

01:10:26.180 --> 01:10:29.300
I refuse to have a favorite color, it's so fucking dumb, you know that, you're a fan

01:10:29.300 --> 01:10:39.900
of the show, John Philippe, what is your reaction to happy people when you're in this time of

01:10:39.900 --> 01:10:48.980
grief, like, do you secretly like wish that they, you know, is there a resentment, is

01:10:48.980 --> 01:10:49.980
there...

01:10:49.980 --> 01:10:53.220
Well, there were some resentment, especially towards my friend, because their lives sort

01:10:53.220 --> 01:10:57.740
of continue on, while mine has stopped, but at one point you have to accept that that's

01:10:57.740 --> 01:11:01.140
how life is, is that mine has temporarily stopped, but other people are allowed to have

01:11:01.140 --> 01:11:05.340
fun, other people are allowed to enjoy themselves, and eventually I will.

01:11:05.340 --> 01:11:14.340
That is a double therapist talking, this guy's got it with Bill Ferrell, you're like, you're

01:11:14.340 --> 01:11:18.340
like, Cyber Christ, no, Cyber Christ was evil, that's Lawnmower Man...

01:11:18.340 --> 01:11:21.260
I'd like after the show, if you're hanging around, like, I'd love to just have a drink

01:11:21.260 --> 01:11:22.260
and just chat with you about...

01:11:22.260 --> 01:11:26.380
Well, for sure, you probably won't be able to buy your own drinks after this at the bar.

01:11:26.380 --> 01:11:27.380
I'm good with that.

01:11:27.380 --> 01:11:30.820
And this guy, we're gonna get you so fucked up.

01:11:30.820 --> 01:11:32.660
Whenever they open the bar, I don't know, it's like...

01:11:32.660 --> 01:11:36.060
They're not gonna let you back in the Ottawa, you're like, no, you're staying in Montreal.

01:11:36.060 --> 01:11:37.700
I got no problem with that.

01:11:37.700 --> 01:11:40.420
Are you going to the shows while you're here, or are you...

01:11:40.420 --> 01:11:41.420
That's the only one?

01:11:41.420 --> 01:11:42.420
Really?

01:11:42.420 --> 01:11:43.420
I feel so...

01:11:43.420 --> 01:11:48.780
Pressured, and embarrassed, yes, I know, it's terrible, I came here to, like, I should

01:11:48.780 --> 01:11:54.620
have had a letter and I, like, I should have had an act, I should have had material.

01:11:54.620 --> 01:12:01.620
I am going to, do you have, like, not a rap beat, but, like, a beautiful, like, a ballad

01:12:01.620 --> 01:12:02.620
kind of thing?

01:12:02.620 --> 01:12:05.620
You're talking to me, right?

01:12:05.620 --> 01:12:06.620
Yeah.

01:12:06.620 --> 01:12:08.620
Yeah, let's see what we have here.

01:12:08.620 --> 01:12:12.620
You know, I'm very curious to know what you're about to do with this.

01:12:12.620 --> 01:12:19.620
I just want to sing to Montreal, and I don't think it's gonna make John Philippe feel better,

01:12:19.620 --> 01:12:23.620
but it may make a...

01:12:23.620 --> 01:12:24.620
No.

01:12:24.620 --> 01:12:25.620
Shayna.

01:12:25.620 --> 01:12:33.420
It may make Shayna bummed out, and I think John Philippe will secretly like that.

01:12:33.420 --> 01:12:34.620
That's my strategy.

01:12:34.620 --> 01:12:35.620
Yeah.

01:12:35.620 --> 01:12:36.620
Oh, shit.

01:12:36.620 --> 01:12:37.620
Oh, yeah.

01:12:37.620 --> 01:12:38.620
Kingdom of the North.

01:12:38.620 --> 01:12:39.620
Yeah.

01:12:39.620 --> 01:12:40.620
Yeah.

01:12:40.620 --> 01:12:41.620
Yeah.

01:12:41.620 --> 01:12:42.620
Get back.

01:12:42.620 --> 01:12:43.620

joke well this math joke the welder's met now or give a new one all right well

01:26:43.660 --> 01:26:46.500
the kid is walking and he finds a welder's mask and there's a guy pulls up

01:26:46.500 --> 01:26:49.860
and says like hey kid and the kid gets in the truck and he's like I did do you

01:26:49.860 --> 01:26:54.180
know what a dude do you know what a fallacious is and the kid says no and

01:26:54.180 --> 01:26:57.540
then the guy says you know what do you know what do you know what pseudomy is

01:26:57.540 --> 01:27:00.500
and the kid says no and he says do you know what a pedophile is and he says

01:27:00.500 --> 01:27:06.900
listen mister I gotta tell you I'm not a real welder that's the worst telling of

01:27:06.900 --> 01:27:14.620
the aristocrat show and then the duck with the guy comes into the brothel and

01:27:14.620 --> 01:27:22.300
gets a duck because they're out of human hookers and so they give him a duck and

01:27:22.300 --> 01:27:26.500
he has a great time with the duck so he comes back the next day and he says I

01:27:26.500 --> 01:27:31.860
can I have the duck and they give him a duck and he says that's great and they

01:27:31.860 --> 01:27:34.860
said that'll be twice as much money as last time I forgot to mention the price

01:27:34.860 --> 01:27:39.580
and he says why and he said they said because you have AIDS now because the

01:27:39.580 --> 01:27:44.140
duck gave you AIDS because that's a different duck and they're all identical

01:27:44.140 --> 01:27:47.740
you can't tell which one as guys like well why does it have to be a different

01:27:47.740 --> 01:27:52.780
duck why couldn't it have gotten AIDS and they said how fast do you think an AIDS

01:27:52.780 --> 01:27:58.340
duck test is like you have to send it off and there's a centrifuge and it's

01:27:58.340 --> 01:28:02.620
like that's not like that's that's not something that we consider worth it in

01:28:02.620 --> 01:28:06.540
our brothel budget so it's like I'm telling you it was two different ducks

01:28:06.540 --> 01:28:09.740
why would I lie and the guys like great so now I have AIDS that got transmitted

01:28:09.740 --> 01:28:14.180
from a duck really and they're like yeah boy we're we're prostitutes not

01:28:14.180 --> 01:28:19.740
scientists but pretty sure if a duck has AIDS and you fuck it you need AIDS

01:28:19.740 --> 01:28:22.740
