00:00.000 --> 00:08.240
Welcome, one and all, to Dynasty Typewriter in downtown Los Angeles, where they're about

00:08.240 --> 00:11.440
Harmontown, as once again in session.

00:11.440 --> 00:22.560
Let's bring out the game master, Mr. Spencer Crittenden.

00:22.560 --> 00:37.680
Oh yeah, Spencer's hittin' down on his desk couch, it's a cabinet, it's got drawers on

00:37.680 --> 00:38.680
it.

00:38.680 --> 00:40.680
I'm talkin', I'm talkin', you got a hold on, like, hold on couch.

00:40.680 --> 00:43.680
Oh, it's more like a love seat.

00:43.680 --> 00:45.680
It's like a fainting couch.

00:45.680 --> 00:50.120
Speaking of love, let's welcome the sexiest seat in town, the mayor of Harmontown, Mr.

00:50.120 --> 00:51.120
Dan Harmon.

00:51.120 --> 01:13.200
Oh, Tim, Tim, Tim, thank you, thank you, thank you, thanks.

01:13.200 --> 01:20.040
I have to pick and choose, I had a couple things to talk about, but I gotta go in order

01:20.040 --> 01:28.880
of importance, or I'll forget the most important thing, which is, I looked into why balls hang

01:28.880 --> 01:37.040
off the body today, and for years, because I've always known that explanation that you've

01:37.040 --> 01:43.560
heard, which is like, oh, it takes a degree cooler temperature for sperm to be either

01:43.560 --> 01:49.400
made or stored, and it's like, what?

01:49.400 --> 01:53.000
You're telling me they didn't figure out a way, it's just, something rang false about

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
it.

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
And I always, it was the most scientific explanation, it was like, oh, there needs to be cooler

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
down there.

01:59.000 --> 02:06.280
And I found, the thing that makes the most sense about what I learned is that part of

02:06.280 --> 02:12.280
the lie is that that's true, the balls are hangin' down there for a temperature difference.

02:12.280 --> 02:20.640
But the darker, more sinister thing is that it's not necessary, it's not like, oh, it's

02:20.640 --> 02:26.400
a deal breaker for the evolution of life, God, there's no other way to make sperm, it

02:26.400 --> 02:33.440
could never happen, and forget about storing them, and oh, boy, sperm, they're so delicate,

02:33.440 --> 02:38.880
they're so, it's such an amazing process, and it needs to be this certain temperature.

02:38.880 --> 02:47.880
You know, the sperm prefer it, they live longer and use less resources, so it's like a group

02:47.880 --> 02:53.920
on, you're, it makes such, I was so, I was like, that's it, the sperm are, they're running

02:53.920 --> 02:54.920
the show.

02:54.920 --> 02:59.600
They got like a lever, they're pullin', they're like, let's take out up a notch, get these

02:59.600 --> 03:00.600
balls down here.

03:00.600 --> 03:04.920
There's that one sperm that comes into the ball and goes, it's hot in here, can I go

03:04.920 --> 03:08.840
check it, can I go to the AC and make a little cooler in here?

03:08.840 --> 03:14.120
That is what they're doing, because when sperm are, they're such simple organisms, like little

03:14.120 --> 03:19.600
ants, I don't know if it's gross to think about ants in your balls, but like, what they

03:19.600 --> 03:27.480
share is that there's no circulatory system, there's nothing, look, sperm have a longer,

03:27.480 --> 03:33.600
more comfortable life in your balls than they would in a cup of soup, like, and it's because,

03:33.600 --> 03:40.520
like, they get heat activated, like, they know when they are and aren't in a vagina,

03:40.520 --> 03:45.720
but if they feel like they're kind of in a vagina, they'll, well, then they'll just

03:45.720 --> 03:50.360
be all hustle, bustle, and they'll run out of their little lunches that their daddy packed

03:50.360 --> 03:59.400
for them, and the sperm can't have that, they want to live all day, it's like, they're just

03:59.400 --> 04:02.840
like, yes, that's what we are, we're so, we are a sperm.

04:02.840 --> 04:08.800
They live in a constant body temperature, like 98.6 or whatever, and then they get into

04:08.800 --> 04:11.880
a vagina, they're just going to be like, they're still in the jacuzzi, like, they're still

04:11.880 --> 04:14.880
going to be relaxed and chilling out, but what's the question?

04:14.880 --> 04:21.120
When they get into a vagina, and this is why, whenever you've wondered, you can understand

04:21.120 --> 04:27.280
why a science class would avoid this semantically, because we're just, we're already uncomfortable,

04:27.280 --> 04:32.080
we're talking about, well, it knows when it's in a pussy, and it's kind of weird to talk

04:32.080 --> 04:38.520
about even in a health class or something, because it's like, it's too much, sex ed,

04:38.520 --> 04:42.960
they try to keep it, they try to keep everything separate, they're explaining all these things

04:42.960 --> 04:48.920
to you about what might happen and definitely shouldn't happen, but why your body's going

04:48.920 --> 04:52.800
through changes, do you have sex ed in school?

04:52.800 --> 04:58.320
But they, even if it's a co-ed thing, they kind of like, they don't, it's like they mentioned

04:58.320 --> 05:03.600
the act, but it's like this idea of like, well, the sperm, what you guys need to understand

05:03.600 --> 05:08.800
is that you're packing a population of 100 million torpedoes, and they want to be in

05:08.800 --> 05:12.240
one place, and once they get there, it's on.

05:12.240 --> 05:17.160
That's the part that's uncomfortable, is that when they, they get kind of heat activated,

05:17.160 --> 05:21.320
and then they're, they're like, this is it, I've been waiting my whole life, this is

05:21.320 --> 05:26.720
where I'm going to die, here in this desert or whatever, but they will also, the important

05:26.720 --> 05:34.480
thing to understand is that they're not, it's not like, it's not that they would burst out

05:34.480 --> 05:39.240
on their own because they'd get so excited because your balls would be one degree warmer,

05:39.240 --> 05:42.720
it's just that they, it's the equivalent of them putting like cucumbers on their eyes

05:42.720 --> 05:48.280
at night, like they're just living longer, they just want to be pretty, like they just,

05:48.280 --> 05:53.600
they want to like be, they want to be kept in a cooler room, because it makes them eat

05:53.600 --> 05:54.600
less, yeah.

05:54.600 --> 05:58.680
It's like they're doing yoga or whatever, it's anything, it's like they're the sentience,

05:58.680 --> 06:02.960
you know, that's the, they heard this thing on NPR about how, you know, when you're a,

06:02.960 --> 06:09.000
when you're developing, like your first cells are your gametes, I mean, you are, you are

06:09.000 --> 06:16.160
a 3D printer that refuses to, the species is like, I'm not going to use toner on a 3D

06:16.160 --> 06:21.800
printer that doesn't have a toner, like, like, because the whole point is making more shit,

06:21.800 --> 06:27.720
like, I imagine, like, for all the things that can go wrong in the womb and during, like,

06:27.720 --> 06:33.540
the gestation from blastocyst to viable fetus, you know, we, we, we, there's a whole room

06:33.540 --> 06:38.480
full of us experiencing the glorious variations that can occur throughout that development,

06:38.480 --> 06:46.400
many of them totally precluding an active chance at reproduction, the, the, but, and,

06:46.400 --> 06:51.840
like, nature is, like, totally willing to lay those bets, but if you, if you were, like,

06:51.840 --> 06:54.960
in the womb and it was, like, something fucked with the whole point of it, it would, like,

06:54.960 --> 06:57.280
it probably shuts that down a thousand times more often.

06:57.280 --> 06:59.720
It's not going to waste a penny on you.

06:59.720 --> 07:05.760
Your balls, your sperm are down in your balls, wagging the dog of your whole life.

07:05.760 --> 07:10.040
They're just, like, like, at a nice 95 degrees.

07:10.040 --> 07:11.520
What a bunch of little dicks.

07:11.520 --> 07:18.200
Did I, am I making this up, but did I overhear someone say that the slight variation in temperature

07:18.200 --> 07:20.800
will decide whether it's male or female?

07:20.800 --> 07:24.000
Well, alligators do it that way.

07:24.000 --> 07:31.360
The alligators, their eggs, the temperature of them, look, I've been to Florida.

07:31.360 --> 07:36.720
The alligators have that, the temperature determines gender of the, of the eggs, so I don't get

07:36.720 --> 07:37.720
that at all.

07:37.720 --> 07:43.880
But it kind of goes to show you, like, we might overstate the importance of, like, the

07:43.880 --> 07:49.000
intricate, I mean, that's really shotgunning, like, that is playing, like, weird fire,

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
isn't it?

07:50.000 --> 07:56.480
Like, to, they, the alligators have their gender determination plugged into a, like, directly

07:56.480 --> 08:04.840
into the environment, like, and they're prehistoric, they've been around forever.

08:04.840 --> 08:08.760
So probably, like, everything is just kind of an experiment, like, there's nothing.

08:08.760 --> 08:14.040
Yeah, they, they, they take their sperm cell, basically, their egg, and they put it in nature,

08:14.040 --> 08:16.840
and so nature is alligators' balls.

08:16.840 --> 08:17.840
Yeah.

08:17.840 --> 08:22.360
But alligators, alligators do have balls.

08:22.360 --> 08:25.120
I'm gonna get that tattooed.

08:25.120 --> 08:28.000
That's how much I believe in that statement.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.920
Alligators have testes, but they're located on the inside of the alligator, which is a

08:30.920 --> 08:33.720
natural place you'd put your testes.

08:33.720 --> 08:37.160
But those sperm would then would have to, they would, they would live to half their

08:37.160 --> 08:42.200
age and they would feel so, imagine the futility.

08:42.200 --> 08:46.600
Imagine being a sperm, I mean, they have a right, you know, to, like, live their full

08:46.600 --> 08:48.760
sperm life.

08:48.760 --> 08:51.720
How dare we?

08:51.720 --> 08:56.560
And here, and there's, there's a muscle, it's not, I made, I made my employees look

08:56.560 --> 08:59.720
into this today.

08:59.720 --> 09:03.760
When you have a writer's assistant, it just becomes so, it's so much better than Googling.

09:03.760 --> 09:06.920
It gets, it, you feel like you have, like, this legitimacy, like, like, this.

09:06.920 --> 09:10.880
Johnson, I want to, I want to report on everything about balls on my desk tomorrow morning.

09:10.880 --> 09:15.880
Look at, look at balls, look at balls, how come balls are dangling, bro?

09:15.880 --> 09:19.440
We're writing an episode about it.

09:19.440 --> 09:21.200
Can't sue me.

09:21.200 --> 09:25.840
Come on, ladies, talk about balls with your boss.

09:25.840 --> 09:32.000
I've learned nothing.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.600
That just occurred to me.

09:35.600 --> 09:40.120
How come balls are dangling is a great Google search string, I think.

09:40.120 --> 09:44.800
I find, you ever, you ever, you, you know, I find myself saying this a lot lately when

09:44.800 --> 09:50.360
I, I find myself consistently saying, I'll learn something and then I'll go, wow, that's

09:50.360 --> 09:56.320
simultaneously uplifting and downtrodding, like, is that happening to you as you get

09:56.320 --> 09:57.320
older?

09:57.320 --> 10:02.720
Cause it's like you're more tasting the sublime qualities of the universe and you're kind

10:02.720 --> 10:06.960
of like, I don't, oh, that's an interesting story, but you don't get as fired up about

10:06.960 --> 10:10.480
did the good guys win or lose?

10:10.480 --> 10:13.640
You're just kind of like, there's another one of those stories and you kind of like

10:13.640 --> 10:18.000
start getting off on the equilibrium of it, like, I don't know who I'm rooting for in

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
that story.

10:19.000 --> 10:23.080
Give me a, give me a, give me a, for instance, ah, boy, geez, I don't know us.

10:23.080 --> 10:29.120
For instance, ah, for cry, I, I for cry, we know, we don't remember nothing on this

10:29.120 --> 10:30.120
show.

10:30.120 --> 10:31.120
I don't know.

10:31.120 --> 10:32.120
I was just curious.

10:32.120 --> 10:33.120
It doesn't matter.

10:33.120 --> 10:34.120
I got high.

10:34.120 --> 10:35.120
Okay.

10:35.120 --> 10:39.800
Let's, uh, but that's a good segue because our guest, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, is related

10:39.800 --> 10:41.320
to being high.

10:41.320 --> 10:43.280
Whoa.

10:43.280 --> 10:47.120
He made a little thing called dope state, um, for with my studio, star burns.

10:47.120 --> 10:48.120
Hell yeah.

10:48.120 --> 10:49.120
He did.

10:49.120 --> 10:50.280
Um, and he's our new friend.

10:50.280 --> 10:51.280
Are you out there?

10:51.280 --> 10:52.280
Are you back there game?

10:52.280 --> 10:53.280
I guess it doesn't matter.

10:53.280 --> 10:54.280
I think he's out there.

10:54.280 --> 11:03.560
Uh, please welcome your new friend Gabe Sunday to the stage anywhere you like, but I think

11:03.560 --> 11:04.560
oh man.

11:04.560 --> 11:05.560
Okay.

11:05.560 --> 11:07.160
So first question, where'd you get that outfit?

11:07.160 --> 11:08.160
I need it.

11:08.160 --> 11:12.280
Um, yeah, I wore this because this was my like comfy.

11:12.280 --> 11:14.280
This is like my comfy editing gear.

11:14.280 --> 11:15.280
That's great.

11:15.280 --> 11:17.760
I bought scrubs the other day and this is like an upgrade of that.

11:17.760 --> 11:23.440
For those listening, he's, uh, he's got kind of a flight suit, like military jumper kind

11:23.440 --> 11:24.440
of thing.

11:24.440 --> 11:25.440
I got my super tight shirt on.

11:25.440 --> 11:28.080
So Starburns, uh, Starburns are, yeah, super tight.

11:28.080 --> 11:32.640
You look like a guy in Top Gun that like that's, it was like the Top Guns drug dealer.

11:32.640 --> 11:35.520
That the out, that the out day one in Top Gun.

11:35.520 --> 11:40.920
The only one that's like, you know, you had, you had clearance to get on the base, but

11:40.920 --> 11:41.920
they make, they made you wear that.

11:41.920 --> 11:43.480
So you look like you kind of fit in.

11:43.480 --> 11:44.480
All right.

11:44.480 --> 11:45.480
I got too high.

11:45.480 --> 11:46.480
I got too high.

11:46.480 --> 11:47.800
That's perfect.

11:47.800 --> 11:48.800
That's perfect.

11:48.800 --> 11:49.800
Man.

11:49.800 --> 11:50.800
It's great, man.

11:50.800 --> 11:54.840
Do you find yourself when you, do you ever get too high as that question first?

11:54.840 --> 11:55.840
Absolutely.

11:55.840 --> 11:56.840
I'm, I'm very sad.

11:56.840 --> 11:58.600
I have a very precarious relationship with Meryl.

11:58.600 --> 12:03.680
I mean, like, I don't, I'm not, I can't, I do crave it because it's my, it's what,

12:03.680 --> 12:05.440
it's, I made a show about weed.

12:05.440 --> 12:07.560
It's like a mockumentary comedy series.

12:07.560 --> 12:09.240
Let's get to that in a second.

12:09.240 --> 12:10.240
Okay.

12:10.240 --> 12:11.240
Tell me about what you were saying.

12:11.240 --> 12:12.240
Yeah.

12:12.240 --> 12:19.240
Or just starting naming fruits and I'll forget what I asked.

12:19.240 --> 12:23.320
Stop saying you have options.

12:23.320 --> 12:24.320
Stop saying what you're saying.

12:24.320 --> 12:26.360
We'll go, go back to what we were saying.

12:26.360 --> 12:27.360
Yeah.

12:27.360 --> 12:28.360
Yeah.

12:28.360 --> 12:29.960
I'm uncomfortable too, Dan.

12:29.960 --> 12:30.960
Yeah.

12:30.960 --> 12:31.960
Yeah.

12:31.960 --> 12:32.960
I'm, I'm, I'm in my own.

12:32.960 --> 12:33.960
Apples.

12:33.960 --> 12:34.960
Can you describe getting too high?

12:34.960 --> 12:36.360
Cause people use the word paranoid.

12:36.360 --> 12:40.520
And when I was in my twenties, I never understood what the old guys meant when they said, I

12:40.520 --> 12:42.520
can't smoke pot anymore.

12:42.520 --> 12:43.520
I get paranoid.

12:43.520 --> 12:44.520
And I never knew.

12:44.520 --> 12:46.640
I was like, first, that sounds fun.

12:46.640 --> 12:47.640
Like what?

12:47.640 --> 12:53.560
You take a drug that makes you think people are out to get you because nobody's ever

12:53.560 --> 12:55.560
been out to get you when you're 20.

12:55.560 --> 12:58.000
And so you're like, that sounds like a pill I'd take.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
Right.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
Right.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
Right.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
Yeah.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
Like I play video games to be paranoid, but then, and then, and then, and then sometime

13:03.000 --> 13:04.160
in my thirties, I'm going to use my eye statements.

13:04.160 --> 13:05.160
I keep using you.

13:05.160 --> 13:07.600
And I'm like, come on, Harmon, speak for yourself.

13:07.600 --> 13:12.560
And then sometime in my thirties, I just, I had that first like, oh, I got too high.

13:12.560 --> 13:15.400
And I shouldn't be because I'm 30.

13:15.400 --> 13:19.680
And then I have rent due tomorrow.

13:19.680 --> 13:23.040
And like the heinous turn, I think that's what, I think that's what people mean when

13:23.040 --> 13:24.040
they talk about paranoia.

13:24.040 --> 13:28.840
I think marijuana shows us things that we need to be attentive and pay attention to.

13:28.840 --> 13:31.600
You know, it's like, fuck, gotta call my dad back.

13:31.600 --> 13:34.200
It's been a few weeks and fuck, I gotta check the thing.

13:34.200 --> 13:35.960
And like, this doesn't feel good.

13:35.960 --> 13:36.960
Like what's here?

13:36.960 --> 13:38.800
Like the lung or is this like the liver?

13:38.800 --> 13:41.680
Like I gotta go, you know, and like you start getting your head about that.

13:41.680 --> 13:45.880
And I really do feel like pot is a thing that points out things you need to be attentive

13:45.880 --> 13:46.880
to.

13:46.880 --> 13:50.920
And part of like one of the reason where I think paranoia and uncomfortableness comes

13:50.920 --> 13:55.520
from is like people who maybe need to just check in with like breathing and just being

13:55.520 --> 13:56.760
in their moment and blah, blah, blah.

13:56.760 --> 13:59.920
But yeah, to answer your question, most times I smoke weed.

13:59.920 --> 14:02.720
I'm like, fuck, I always forget this part where I smoke.

14:02.720 --> 14:05.040
And then I'm like, oh, we're back here again.

14:05.040 --> 14:09.600
You know, it's like, oh, fuck, oh, now I'm in that place, how long is this gonna take?

14:09.600 --> 14:13.240
Part of our group that I travel with a lot is a guy we travel with and he doesn't like

14:13.240 --> 14:18.520
to fly and he takes his little tiny, like really, really low dosage, like little mints

14:18.520 --> 14:25.040
that are weedy, you know, kind of edible mints, weedies, weedies, yeah, you got Bruce

14:25.040 --> 14:30.200
Jenner on the cover of the thing and that's how old he's a guy.

14:30.200 --> 14:35.360
And he gave me, he's like, they put you right to sleep, like I sleep on plants, he goes

14:35.360 --> 14:39.880
up, but they're so relaxing, all the anxiety that I feel like, you won't even know that

14:39.880 --> 14:40.880
you've taken it.

14:40.880 --> 14:43.200
I took it and I was fucking freaking out.

14:43.200 --> 14:48.360
I'm gonna play with my head and my hands going, oh, like, ah, like get me off of this

14:48.360 --> 14:49.360
fucking thing.

14:49.360 --> 14:54.040
I remember being in an animal collective concert and biting my hand until it bled because I

14:54.040 --> 14:59.080
needed to be rooted in like reality, like I bit my hand until I bled, like I was the

14:59.080 --> 15:03.200
guy in the crowd who was like, I'm having a good time, like, you know, like, this is

15:03.200 --> 15:08.000
fucking great at strawberry jam and like, and I would say that like most of the times

15:08.000 --> 15:12.080
whenever I've been in like a, because I made a weed show, which by the way makes it very

15:12.080 --> 15:16.440
difficult to sell your show because Broad City, they can smoke weed all day, but they

15:16.440 --> 15:18.520
won't sell commercials to a weed thing.

15:18.520 --> 15:20.160
Anyway, that's the whole separate thing.

15:20.160 --> 15:24.520
The thing about weed is like, if you're in a weed show and you go to it like a serious

15:24.520 --> 15:27.360
meeting or like a blah, blah, blah, it's always like, oh, we brought weed because you're the

15:27.360 --> 15:28.360
fucking weed guy.

15:28.360 --> 15:32.800
Like you like being really high, really, really high right now and it just becomes a thing

15:32.800 --> 15:35.480
that it's so normalized, but I'm still not.

15:35.480 --> 15:37.760
I have a very love hate relationship with pot.

15:37.760 --> 15:40.360
I think it's a really fucking heavy drug.

15:40.360 --> 15:41.360
Spencer.

15:41.360 --> 15:42.360
Hey guys.

15:42.360 --> 15:43.360
I should be respected.

15:43.360 --> 15:47.160
I, uh, I understand fashion when I'm high.

15:47.160 --> 15:54.440
I put on, I smoke a, I smoke a doobie and then I'm like, yo, I need long pants.

15:54.440 --> 15:55.440
What's going on?

15:55.440 --> 16:00.160
I mean, I, that, that's, I mean, it's true and some, and that, that manifests like that

16:00.160 --> 16:04.200
a thing of like, it's like changing what you're paying attention to, which never occurred

16:04.200 --> 16:05.200
to me.

16:05.200 --> 16:06.200
That's exactly what it does.

16:06.200 --> 16:10.800
Which, which if you're doing well, if you're in a good space, it could be like your girlfriend's

16:10.800 --> 16:16.920
bra strap or the fact that, uh, uh, you need to breathe like, but in a good way.

16:16.920 --> 16:20.200
No, the, it's, it's like, I, I was trying to create a list because I was like, why did

16:20.200 --> 16:21.800
you, why was your girlfriend's bra strap?

16:21.800 --> 16:22.800
That's a solid start.

16:22.800 --> 16:28.600
That's a bad one item list because now you're just a pervy, pervy guy that's like, uh, sometimes

16:28.600 --> 16:33.320
the grass makes me twitchy, but it's cool with the chicks.

16:33.320 --> 16:38.120
I just, I just like, I became a dazed and confused character.

16:38.120 --> 16:42.600
I've never seen the movie, but I saw the trailer and like, I just, I'm so high.

16:42.600 --> 16:47.280
And then a, like right now there's paranoia that there's a voice going like, look at you.

16:47.280 --> 16:48.280
Look at you.

16:48.280 --> 16:49.280
Listen to yourself.

16:49.280 --> 16:50.280
Are you listening to yourself?

16:50.280 --> 16:51.280
That's my paranoia.

16:51.280 --> 16:53.960
I was like, everybody knows that I'm too high and they're going to make fun of me.

16:53.960 --> 16:57.840
They're going to, they're going to ridicule me for being high and poke fun at me and well,

16:57.840 --> 17:01.480
I'm here to tell you, that's how you'll live.

17:01.480 --> 17:03.440
What's your, what's your own comfort right now?

17:03.440 --> 17:04.440
You're at your own show.

17:04.440 --> 17:05.440
Getting better.

17:05.440 --> 17:06.440
Or like, what?

17:06.440 --> 17:07.440
Oh no.

17:07.440 --> 17:08.440
Well, I know it, but it truly is.

17:08.440 --> 17:12.440
It's funny how it's not always like, oh, a mortgage in a, I've got to hunt the spotted

17:12.440 --> 17:13.440
leopard next Wednesday.

17:13.440 --> 17:18.200
I'm trying to make up anxieties, trying to improvise a list of anxieties.

17:18.200 --> 17:19.200
Number one was mortgage.

17:19.200 --> 17:21.400
Straight to mythical creature hunting.

17:21.400 --> 17:23.480
I guess I've never had to worry about anything.

17:23.480 --> 17:25.440
Dan, go back to what you were saying.

17:25.440 --> 17:28.840
Like that was where a normal person would have like, I've got to clean the gutters or

17:28.840 --> 17:35.880
tie my shoes or, you know, not enjoy total fucking psychic hegemony over all creatures

17:35.880 --> 17:41.920
great and small to the point where I have to create my own crises so that I can feel

17:41.920 --> 17:42.920
valuable.

17:42.920 --> 17:49.120
I can feel the tension of me pushing up against failure as otherwise I don't know if I'm

17:49.120 --> 17:50.120
alive.

17:50.120 --> 17:53.320
Anyway, so you made this, I'm just really happy.

17:53.320 --> 17:54.320
I'm not high right now.

17:54.320 --> 17:57.600
Like, I would be staring at you being like, got to think the funny thing.

17:57.600 --> 17:58.600
Got it.

17:58.600 --> 17:59.600
Got to follow you.

17:59.600 --> 18:00.600
Got to follow you up that.

18:00.600 --> 18:01.600
All right.

18:01.600 --> 18:03.600
So tell us about dope state.

18:03.600 --> 18:04.600
Yeah.

18:04.600 --> 18:05.600
Thank you for saying.

18:05.600 --> 18:06.600
Oh, yeah.

18:06.600 --> 18:07.600
Great smile from Jeff.

18:07.600 --> 18:09.600
I'm feeling rooted on here.

18:09.600 --> 18:10.600
Dope states show.

18:10.600 --> 18:11.600
We made it.

18:11.600 --> 18:16.720
Starbucks Industries took a couple years and was a, it's a mockumentary set in the cannabis

18:16.720 --> 18:19.400
culture boom in California.

18:19.400 --> 18:26.640
And I play a handful of characters, dab girls, daddies, dealer, well, no, you play a dealer

18:26.640 --> 18:27.640
in it.

18:27.640 --> 18:31.480
And, and then we're surrounded by a lot of comedians, most of which are in the starburn

18:31.480 --> 18:34.760
space at least some degree, kind of passing through and showing everything from like Silicon

18:34.760 --> 18:39.480
Valley culture to the people getting pushed out of the industry, which is what I grew

18:39.480 --> 18:44.120
up around, you know, growers and dealers who are now getting pushed out because of dispensaries

18:44.120 --> 18:45.120
and all that.

18:45.120 --> 18:51.320
The first season, six episodes on Pluto TV, and it really focuses on the old school pot

18:51.320 --> 18:57.760
game that's being like completely just decimated by big, the big cannabis boom right now.

18:57.760 --> 19:02.960
Pluto TV, Pluto TV, it's free TV Spence on Pluto and Earth.

19:02.960 --> 19:03.960
Yeah.

19:03.960 --> 19:04.960
Yeah.

19:04.960 --> 19:05.960
Channel 420.

19:05.960 --> 19:08.960
We're on the wheat channel channel.

19:08.960 --> 19:10.760
Pluto TV is channel 420.

19:10.760 --> 19:13.760
No, no, no, it's 420 on on Pluto TV.

19:13.760 --> 19:18.720
So you get on your phone and then channel 420 is the, is the, the wheat, the wheat channel.

19:18.720 --> 19:24.280
A couple of days ago, Cody informed me was the, your last chance to get married and have

19:24.280 --> 19:28.240
your 50th anniversary be on 42069.

19:28.240 --> 19:29.240
Yeah.

19:29.240 --> 19:34.320
And we were like, we were reaching for the keys, like on our way to city hall.

19:34.320 --> 19:40.400
And then we're like, can you imagine trying to get that laugh 50 years from now?

19:40.400 --> 19:48.280
You'd be like, first I have to explain calendars to a fucking hologram of a, of Pokemon that's

19:48.280 --> 19:52.520
just like coming through my id because no one's real anymore.

19:52.520 --> 19:54.080
Like there is no people.

19:54.080 --> 19:58.320
There would be, there's no, if there's people 50 years from now, I quit.

19:58.320 --> 19:59.320
I quit.

19:59.320 --> 20:00.320
Yeah.

20:00.320 --> 20:01.320
Sorry.

20:01.320 --> 20:02.320
I cut you off.

20:02.320 --> 20:07.040
Do you, do you have any opinions about the corporatization of marijuana?

20:07.040 --> 20:12.760
Uh, I think it's, you know, there's, there's the, the, the schism, schism between legalization

20:12.760 --> 20:14.600
and decriminalization.

20:14.600 --> 20:19.680
And obviously in California, we chose legalization and that opens the door for big businesses

20:19.680 --> 20:25.560
to steal all the businesses of honest drug dealers without, you know, preventing drug

20:25.560 --> 20:30.040
dealings, just selling a product, you know, the medicine people do it and we, we say it's

20:30.040 --> 20:31.040
great.

20:31.040 --> 20:34.000
But, uh, you know, they're just taking all the business from all these, these earnest,

20:34.000 --> 20:38.080
hardworking folk that have been fulfilling a big need and getting arrested for it, which

20:38.080 --> 20:39.080
is bad.

20:39.080 --> 20:42.600
And obviously they're not, I don't even know why I have to ask this out loud, but because

20:42.600 --> 20:45.160
there's probably some discussion about it.

20:45.160 --> 20:47.760
Why am I you explaining why you ask questions?

20:47.760 --> 20:48.760
Because you're high.

20:48.760 --> 20:53.000
You're high as bat pussy, right?

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
Whoa.

20:54.000 --> 20:57.000
And they sleep upside down.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
Belfrees.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
Yeah.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.000
They sleep upside down.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
That's about as high as, that's high as it gets.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.600
They live in belfrees and they sleep upside down.

21:04.600 --> 21:08.320
I heard that from Steve Agee, I'm like, that's the greatest I've ever heard in my life.

21:08.320 --> 21:12.440
You don't get any higher in the animal kingdom than a bat pussy.

21:12.440 --> 21:16.760
They sleep on the ceiling, but upside down so their head is lower than their person.

21:16.760 --> 21:21.920
And it's not just bat genitals because the male bat penis immediately flaps down like

21:21.920 --> 21:25.160
an ironing board in a hotel as soon as it goes to sleep.

21:25.160 --> 21:29.480
And it's just every inch counts, ask the people that built the belfree, why'd you put that

21:29.480 --> 21:32.200
cross up there if it wasn't to beat the church across the street?

21:32.200 --> 21:35.600
You know, in this arms race for God's grace, what am I saying?

21:35.600 --> 21:37.200
No, this is good.

21:37.200 --> 21:38.200
This is good.

21:38.200 --> 21:39.200
It's illegalization.

21:39.200 --> 21:42.200
It's some ASPD stuff.

21:42.200 --> 21:43.200
What?

21:43.200 --> 21:44.200
What?

21:44.200 --> 21:45.200
Why?

21:45.200 --> 21:49.120
The propositions are passed and then legalizations put through.

21:49.120 --> 21:50.800
Should I get you some popcorn or something like that?

21:50.800 --> 21:51.800
You want some snacks?

21:51.800 --> 21:52.800
We can get some pizza.

21:52.800 --> 21:53.800
Call the police.

21:53.800 --> 21:54.800
Yes.

21:54.800 --> 21:55.800
Oh, I did.

21:55.800 --> 21:56.800
They're coming.

21:56.800 --> 22:00.720
I just want to, I just want to talk to someone that will put me straight.

22:00.720 --> 22:04.920
No, this is actually perfect because I'm experiencing the other side of the pot thing.

22:04.920 --> 22:09.000
Like if you having a little bit of like uncomfort, I was really high yesterday at the Renaissance

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
Fair.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
Oh, yeah.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.520
We didn't go to the another renter.

22:12.520 --> 22:16.880
George R. Martin was there two years ago, I saw him hit a little like dinky dragon on

22:16.880 --> 22:17.880
his shoulder.

22:17.880 --> 22:20.880
Like he was walking around just buying his meats and drink.

22:20.880 --> 22:22.600
He was, he was having a ball.

22:22.600 --> 22:23.600
Just buying his.

22:23.600 --> 22:26.840
But I'm, but I'm a great bunch of shop there.

22:26.840 --> 22:30.240
You go get a nice tenderloin, sweet turkey leg.

22:30.240 --> 22:32.240
Yeah.

22:32.240 --> 22:38.800
I'm experiencing the next day weed lackadaisical lethargy of like the mind of like bad pussy.

22:38.800 --> 22:40.640
I got something to say about that.

22:40.640 --> 22:45.880
And then it's like like someone pressing against my forehead, just like setting me back.

22:45.880 --> 22:46.880
Like that's what I get.

22:46.880 --> 22:51.040
That's the negative side effects for weed for me is like the hangover is like that.

22:51.040 --> 22:52.040
Yeah, the weed hangover.

22:52.040 --> 22:53.040
I hate the weed hangover.

22:53.040 --> 22:54.040
I love it.

22:54.040 --> 22:58.120
Oh, I, I actually I'm trying to stop smoking weed.

22:58.120 --> 23:01.560
I've been getting paranoia and panic attacks lately.

23:01.560 --> 23:02.560
Not great.

23:02.560 --> 23:03.560
I was in line somewhere.

23:03.560 --> 23:04.800
I thought I was having a heart attack.

23:04.800 --> 23:08.040
Yeah, I might have been having a heart attack.

23:08.040 --> 23:11.920
You pace back and forth and you're like checking your pulse because if you're going to have

23:11.920 --> 23:13.720
a heart attack, you want to be the first to know, right?

23:13.720 --> 23:17.680
You're the I mean, no one else way to do that kids is to just always check your pulse.

23:17.680 --> 23:21.360
Is that just after smoking like you just after smoking it was in that case.

23:21.360 --> 23:22.360
Yeah.

23:22.360 --> 23:23.360
Yeah.

23:23.360 --> 23:28.560
In these war movies, you know, like a bombshell goes off nearby the person and they have this

23:28.560 --> 23:31.640
ringing in their ears and they can't hear anything that was happening to me.

23:31.640 --> 23:34.120
And I was like, wait, that doesn't happen in real life.

23:34.120 --> 23:35.120
That's a movie thing.

23:35.120 --> 23:36.120
I'm dying.

23:36.120 --> 23:41.800
And no, I swear I was going to mention that like I and then I thought don't bring that

23:41.800 --> 23:42.800
up.

23:42.800 --> 23:46.240
Like that's not that's a subjective experience for you, but it's interesting that you brought

23:46.240 --> 23:47.240
that up.

23:47.240 --> 23:50.280
Yeah, because you've probably heard people say I get panic attacks and I never looked

23:50.280 --> 23:53.400
up what a panic attack was and I was like, yeah, I freak out all the time.

23:53.400 --> 23:54.400
What?

23:54.400 --> 23:56.840
But like, no, a panic attack is like a medical thing where it feels like you're having a

23:56.840 --> 23:57.840
heart attack or whatever.

23:57.840 --> 23:58.840
It's terrifying.

23:58.840 --> 24:00.240
And that's been happening.

24:00.240 --> 24:01.240
It's no good.

24:01.240 --> 24:02.240
I've been trying.

24:02.240 --> 24:04.440
I smoked on 420, but I haven't really smoked the last couple of weeks.

24:04.440 --> 24:06.200
I don't I don't think I'm going to keep smoking.

24:06.200 --> 24:14.120
Now, do you think gentlemen for the panel, yes, do you think that that is a function of

24:14.120 --> 24:21.480
biology, chemicals or anything, or is that more psychology, your your life changing and

24:21.480 --> 24:28.400
getting getting high, having the same effect on you that you're you're parsing it differently

24:28.400 --> 24:30.960
because you your your life is changing.

24:30.960 --> 24:33.040
I would guess aging has something to do with it.

24:33.040 --> 24:37.440
And I've read just long term weed use leads to different side effects than short term

24:37.440 --> 24:38.440
weed use.

24:38.440 --> 24:41.480
So after you've been doing it for several years, it can actually affect you psychologically

24:41.480 --> 24:44.080
differently than the first seven years or something.

24:44.080 --> 24:46.920
So it might just be like late weed use or something.

24:46.920 --> 24:48.520
When did we become such squares?

24:48.520 --> 24:50.000
I mean, I've heard of it.

24:50.000 --> 24:54.880
I think it's pretty common for people as they get older to be like, I was really into weed

24:54.880 --> 24:59.480
and then now I'm feeling like all those negative things and I've got no time for it.

24:59.480 --> 25:00.920
But like it does.

25:00.920 --> 25:06.880
Yeah, it has it for I especially being recently like doing promotion and all this for this

25:06.880 --> 25:11.480
and like I've been thrusted in the scene of like go weed, like it's the fucking thing

25:11.480 --> 25:12.480
for everything.

25:12.480 --> 25:13.480
Oh, yeah.

25:13.480 --> 25:14.480
It's CBD.

25:14.480 --> 25:15.480
Yeah.

25:15.480 --> 25:16.480
And CBD.

25:16.480 --> 25:17.480
And I've had some really good experiences, CBD that didn't freak me out.

25:17.480 --> 25:22.240
But like it's still it's still a pretty intense drug that thrown into it's just not all the

25:22.240 --> 25:23.240
heal all end all.

25:23.240 --> 25:24.920
And I think it's more of that.

25:24.920 --> 25:27.840
It's got this collective excitement behind it, which is wonderful.

25:27.840 --> 25:28.840
Like I love that.

25:28.840 --> 25:33.600
But it's also like, you know, you can't you can't throw it into any mental situation.

25:33.600 --> 25:34.600
Yeah.

25:34.600 --> 25:35.600
You know, and especially like edibles.

25:35.600 --> 25:39.760
Like I think God we're in a day where you can pick out the thing for the airport because

25:39.760 --> 25:42.680
like, okay, my mom would hate that I would tell.

25:42.680 --> 25:46.440
My mom would not like that I would tell this story because she so there's still a little

25:46.440 --> 25:51.360
shame in my family between weed, but my mom grew pot this year and like she got like two

25:51.360 --> 25:52.360
pounds.

25:52.360 --> 25:53.360
It was like a huge amount of people.

25:53.360 --> 25:54.360
I don't know.

25:54.360 --> 25:55.360
Is that like an illegal amount?

25:55.360 --> 25:56.360
What's your address?

25:56.360 --> 25:57.360
My parents are going to get like raided now.

25:57.360 --> 25:58.360
Yeah.

25:58.360 --> 26:03.680
And my mom was like, she doesn't smoke, but she wanted to like make it for her kid and

26:03.680 --> 26:04.680
his friends.

26:04.680 --> 26:06.600
She wanted to give it a shot.

26:06.600 --> 26:07.680
She grew two pounds.

26:07.680 --> 26:08.680
Yeah.

26:08.680 --> 26:11.040
Well, she's a fucking Bay Area like green thumb lady.

26:11.040 --> 26:12.760
She's like, I plan in the past.

26:12.760 --> 26:19.440
I was going to say, yeah, agent, like everything she does or no, she's got a green thumb.

26:19.440 --> 26:20.440
That's adorable.

26:20.440 --> 26:21.440
Yeah.

26:21.440 --> 26:22.440
It was adorable.

26:22.440 --> 26:29.600
And so my adorable 72 year old mother, 71, she was cooking it to make us these little

26:29.600 --> 26:31.320
space balls.

26:31.320 --> 26:34.240
And when you cook THC, so what's a space ball?

26:34.240 --> 26:37.600
Space balls like a little thing like like this big and you put is that like not a term

26:37.600 --> 26:40.680
that's like a big to good like a space cake space.

26:40.680 --> 26:41.680
Space cake.

26:41.680 --> 26:44.240
I've heard this, but these are these come in spherical form little like munchie.

26:44.240 --> 26:45.240
Yeah.

26:45.240 --> 26:47.080
A little munchie think they're healthy made of organic stuff.

26:47.080 --> 26:53.320
But what she didn't know is that when you cook it into oil, that's that psycho that's

26:53.320 --> 27:00.280
psycho activates that psycho activates the weed and then it channelizes the psychoactivization

27:00.280 --> 27:01.280
of process.

27:01.280 --> 27:02.280
Right.

27:02.280 --> 27:07.040
I mean, science where you want to get it's logical.

27:07.040 --> 27:08.280
It intensifies the cycle.

27:08.280 --> 27:09.280
No, no, no.

27:09.280 --> 27:10.280
It turns it on.

27:10.280 --> 27:14.440
It's not the psychoactive property of weed is not really turned on unless it's heat activated

27:14.440 --> 27:15.440
from what I know.

27:15.440 --> 27:19.400
And when you put that into oil and you cook it, it's it's hot.

27:19.400 --> 27:20.400
It's ready.

27:20.400 --> 27:26.440
And my mom then without gloves started making these little space cakes with like, oh, this

27:26.440 --> 27:29.120
is not where I thought the story was going at all.

27:29.120 --> 27:31.120
So I get a, I get a call from my sister.

27:31.120 --> 27:33.720
I'm in a wedding and I get a guy to come home.

27:33.720 --> 27:34.720
Oh my God.

27:34.720 --> 27:35.720
Mom is like, is gone.

27:35.720 --> 27:39.720
I was like, well, I had one of them like it's a little heavy, but like just, you know, tell

27:39.720 --> 27:42.400
her to sit down, put on some discovery, whatever.

27:42.400 --> 27:47.960
And I come home and my mom had ingested like an ounce of pot and she was, she was puking.

27:47.960 --> 27:53.280
She was freaking out, watching my mother, you know, go through like a bad trip, which

27:53.280 --> 27:58.200
was all, you know, it was, she was so scared.

27:58.200 --> 28:04.720
And I sat with her and she was like, Gabe's home, Gabe, Gabe, you know, like it was like

28:04.720 --> 28:09.160
death bed, shit, you know, and I like, and I can't, and she was like grabbing for me.

28:09.160 --> 28:10.160
And she was like, I can't look.

28:10.160 --> 28:11.160
It's too bright.

28:11.160 --> 28:14.960
And every time she'd open her eyes, she'd be like, oh no, this is too bright.

28:14.960 --> 28:19.360
And then she's like, did Red Dead Redemption come out yet?

28:19.360 --> 28:20.360
I missed it.

28:20.360 --> 28:24.680
Like, mom, I've never seen you like this.

28:24.680 --> 28:28.640
And she, and she like grabbed me and like held me and like held my hand and she was like

28:28.640 --> 28:32.640
shaking and I was, I was like, mom, I've been a burning man like eight times.

28:32.640 --> 28:37.040
You're the fucking highest person I have ever seen.

28:37.040 --> 28:38.040
And it was legit.

28:38.040 --> 28:39.040
It was topical.

28:39.040 --> 28:41.160
It was like, it went into her hands.

28:41.160 --> 28:42.920
She didn't smoke any of it.

28:42.920 --> 28:48.400
And then it got awesome because I sat with her and we did like Technahan, like breathing

28:48.400 --> 28:49.400
shit.

28:49.400 --> 28:52.960
And like, I leaned into her ear and I was like, breathe in, breathe out, breathe in, breathe

28:52.960 --> 28:53.960
out.

28:53.960 --> 28:57.000
I sat with her for two hours and pretty soon my mom was like, we're spinning to the left,

28:57.000 --> 29:00.680
Gabe, and you're with me and it's us.

29:00.680 --> 29:04.640
And we're spinning to the left, to the left.

29:04.640 --> 29:08.680
That made me so relaxed just now.

29:08.680 --> 29:10.120
I recorded it.

29:10.120 --> 29:14.160
She was like, listen to what I'm saying to you and never forget.

29:14.160 --> 29:15.960
And it was always to the left.

29:15.960 --> 29:16.960
Right.

29:16.960 --> 29:17.960
Right.

29:17.960 --> 29:18.960
Back into the left.

29:18.960 --> 29:19.960
It was like, whoa.

29:19.960 --> 29:20.960
The Holocaust happens.

29:20.960 --> 29:23.080
Don't let them convince you.

29:23.080 --> 29:24.080
Follow the money.

29:24.080 --> 29:25.240
Silent greenest people.

29:25.240 --> 29:26.240
Follow the money.

29:26.240 --> 29:27.240
Everything to the left.

29:27.240 --> 29:28.440
Shit came out.

29:28.440 --> 29:31.480
She was like, get everybody from the family out here right now.

29:31.480 --> 29:32.480
So we all come out.

29:32.480 --> 29:33.480
My dad's there.

29:33.480 --> 29:37.640
My dad, who has no idea how to handle this shit, he's like, honey, your kids love you.

29:37.640 --> 29:39.640
My mom's like, stop it.

29:39.640 --> 29:43.120
Don't talk to me about anything.

29:43.120 --> 29:44.960
It was coming up.

29:44.960 --> 29:52.280
And I was like, mom, Jesus, Lord, like, you know, like, but we ended up holding hands

29:52.280 --> 29:57.200
and I was crying and she was crying.

29:57.200 --> 30:01.200
And to what extent I get the feeling, I think, from talking to you before, but I kind of

30:01.200 --> 30:07.560
hope I'm wrong, that your parents are kind of, you know, on the front side of this, this

30:07.560 --> 30:11.800
box, your parents aren't like principles in a Pringles commercial.

30:11.800 --> 30:15.080
They're, they're, your parents are hippies, right?

30:15.080 --> 30:17.520
Mr. and Mrs. Mike Pence, yeah, yeah, yeah.

30:17.520 --> 30:18.520
Back into the left.

30:18.520 --> 30:19.520
Fuck, mother.

30:19.520 --> 30:20.520
Fuck.

30:20.520 --> 30:25.120
No flavor crystals in my library.

30:25.120 --> 30:29.080
Whoa, it's fucking reefer.

30:29.080 --> 30:31.640
It's a little, but somehow that makes it more interesting.

30:31.640 --> 30:32.640
Yeah.

30:32.640 --> 30:33.640
I mean, she grew it.

30:33.640 --> 30:34.640
And my dad was.

30:34.640 --> 30:35.640
She grew it.

30:35.640 --> 30:36.640
That's all you need to know about that answer.

30:36.640 --> 30:41.120
But she grew it and, and then my dad was like, yeah, he just was uncomfortable about the

30:41.120 --> 30:42.120
whole thing.

30:42.120 --> 30:43.120
Yeah.

30:43.120 --> 30:46.840
I mean, we're in like the Bay Area and, you know, that, but I still say to anybody listening,

30:46.840 --> 30:50.360
you know, with the whole normalization of shit, we got to catch up with this crap.

30:50.360 --> 30:53.640
You fucking can't cook your weed and touch it with your hands.

30:53.640 --> 30:56.920
Like that must be happening all over to moms.

30:56.920 --> 31:03.920
I went to moms across the nation making their kids up their, their weed and giving me a big

31:03.920 --> 31:07.480
ball of hash and I, and I, someone told me how to make butter out of it.

31:07.480 --> 31:11.560
And so I made this, just like buttered the exact color of your jumpsuit, like it's really

31:11.560 --> 31:12.560
khaki green.

31:12.560 --> 31:13.560
It's really into the jumpsuit.

31:13.560 --> 31:18.040
And, and it showed me how to make butter and I did, I did heat it.

31:18.040 --> 31:22.600
I put it in the thing and, and I made, I made cookies out of it.

31:22.600 --> 31:27.520
And I thought, I'm going to, I'm going to take a half a cookie, give it like a few hours.

31:27.520 --> 31:31.520
Let's do the baseline control group thing and see if it, if it, yeah, I got, I got a

31:31.520 --> 31:32.520
little high.

31:32.520 --> 31:33.520
It was good.

31:33.520 --> 31:36.680
I was waiting a check at the time and she came over and we were going to go out and

31:36.680 --> 31:37.680
do something.

31:37.680 --> 31:42.560
And I, I, I didn't, I forgot all about it that I'd taken it and I, I wasn't like tripping,

31:42.560 --> 31:44.060
you know, like crazy.

31:44.060 --> 31:50.200
And she's sitting on my couch and she's like, Jeff, Jeff, I kind of snap out of a trance

31:50.200 --> 31:57.520
and I go, I go, I go, oh, oh, oh, oh, sorry, what, and she goes, are you okay?

31:57.520 --> 31:58.520
I'm like, what's going on?

31:58.520 --> 32:01.520
And she goes, you've been standing looking at the window for 10 minutes.

32:01.520 --> 32:05.960
I was like, yeah, that tree.

32:05.960 --> 32:06.960
I was there.

32:06.960 --> 32:07.960
She's like, she's, she's sat there.

32:07.960 --> 32:08.960
She's like, what is he doing?

32:08.960 --> 32:11.760
I was like, oh, oh, yeah, I got high earlier.

32:11.760 --> 32:13.880
So then I go, these are pretty good.

32:13.880 --> 32:19.240
And I took two and went to, here's a bad idea.

32:19.240 --> 32:21.640
Anybody see the movie Coraline?

32:21.640 --> 32:22.640
Don't see it.

32:22.640 --> 32:23.640
In 3D.

32:23.640 --> 32:24.640
Bad idea.

32:24.640 --> 32:26.720
Do not, do not see that on way too much edibles.

32:26.720 --> 32:27.720
I was sitting with JJ.

32:27.720 --> 32:33.600
I don't know if that movie never came out in 3D, 3D, 3D, 3D.

32:33.600 --> 32:42.880
That was, that was a rare 2D only movie by Decree of a special dimensional commission.

32:42.880 --> 32:43.880
I was with J.

32:43.880 --> 32:46.480
Johnston and somebody else, maybe Mark Rivers, I don't know who it was.

32:46.480 --> 32:49.520
And I was like, like so freaked out.

32:49.520 --> 32:52.000
I was so paranoid, I couldn't breathe.

32:52.000 --> 32:56.960
And I couldn't do the 3D thing because they were flying into my head.

32:56.960 --> 32:57.960
Sure.

32:57.960 --> 32:58.960
And it was, it was like, get out.

32:58.960 --> 32:59.960
All the Coralines.

32:59.960 --> 33:05.360
I was trying to defend my brain from all of these demons and monsters and shit coming

33:05.360 --> 33:06.360
at me.

33:06.360 --> 33:12.080
But if I took the glasses off, that's worse because now it's all blurry and fucked up.

33:12.080 --> 33:14.480
So I just, and I didn't want to just sit there with my head in my hands, I want the

33:14.480 --> 33:15.880
arc light right in the middle.

33:15.880 --> 33:17.680
And it was, it's so dark in there.

33:17.680 --> 33:26.920
And the arc light in Hollywood, I'm sure they all are, but the Hollywood burn is fucking

33:26.920 --> 33:27.920
dark.

33:27.920 --> 33:33.360
I went to Pasadena, I'm like fucking, I could see my popcorn bro.

33:33.360 --> 33:40.800
It's like, film snobs go there, it's like a richer black, it's a higher quality black,

33:40.800 --> 33:44.840
it brings out the silver and the nitrate behind the film.

33:44.840 --> 33:45.840
Yeah, yeah.

33:45.840 --> 33:46.840
No exit sign.

33:46.840 --> 33:51.840
And so if I try to get up and walk at her, I'm going to fall over everybody and I'm going

33:51.840 --> 33:54.040
to break my neck and make a fool of myself.

33:54.040 --> 33:57.520
It's like, I'm not going to make it through this movie and I want to just sit there with

33:57.520 --> 34:01.920
my head in my hands, but I was going to ruin the movie for my people next to me.

34:01.920 --> 34:07.200
So I toughed it out and I don't remember anything about that movie except my own, just freak

34:07.200 --> 34:08.200
out.

34:08.200 --> 34:14.400
And we all went, we went our separate ways at the end, I think we all met there.

34:14.400 --> 34:18.040
And like, I calmed down towards the end.

34:18.040 --> 34:22.240
And the next day I called up those guys I was with and I said, hey, I don't know if

34:22.240 --> 34:28.840
you noticed, I'm sorry, like I was fucking high and I was freaking out the whole movie

34:28.840 --> 34:31.640
and they're like, dude, I was too.

34:31.640 --> 34:33.320
All three of us were in the exact same boat.

34:33.320 --> 34:39.520
We were afraid to like, if I would have known that we just talk about it to the left, to

34:39.520 --> 34:40.520
the left.

34:40.520 --> 34:46.560
And you guys were all like, man, of all the nights to roll with the Coraline intensive

34:46.560 --> 34:47.560
crew.

34:47.560 --> 34:54.200
Like you're like, shit, fuck, you're supposed to be totally intense about watching Coraline

34:54.200 --> 34:55.200
in this group.

34:55.200 --> 34:57.960
And you were all just high.

34:57.960 --> 35:01.880
If you know where I live and you go through my trash can, when's trash day, Thursday?

35:01.880 --> 35:07.200
Yeah, if you go through my trash can, there's drugs in there because I somebody gave me

35:07.200 --> 35:12.360
these beautifully noted.

35:12.360 --> 35:14.680
That's a great cold open to your next story.

35:14.680 --> 35:16.160
Is that what that is?

35:16.160 --> 35:17.160
Is that what that was?

35:17.160 --> 35:22.680
Well, it's a paranoid thing to say, just as like a wizard panel right before it all know

35:22.680 --> 35:23.680
where I live.

35:23.680 --> 35:24.680
I know you're going through my fucking trash.

35:24.680 --> 35:28.400
If you do it again tonight, I fucks my name is Jeff Davis.

35:28.400 --> 35:29.400
Who am I?

35:29.400 --> 35:30.400
Let's put it this way.

35:30.400 --> 35:31.400
You go to my trash.

35:31.400 --> 35:32.920
Well, there'll be drugs there.

35:32.920 --> 35:33.920
Welcome to the show.

35:33.920 --> 35:38.720
I like the hash browns and scrambled eggs and then and then you're like, anyways, the

35:38.720 --> 35:44.560
A story this week is I lost my keys, but it's anyway, continue, please.

35:44.560 --> 35:49.360
There's a guy, there's a guy that used to go to the drawing room and he he he's a let's

35:49.360 --> 35:56.320
call him a drug dealer and get rid of this shame culture.

35:56.320 --> 35:57.320
Yeah.

35:57.320 --> 35:58.320
Yeah.

35:58.320 --> 35:59.320
He deal.

35:59.320 --> 36:00.320
He just be a drug dealer.

36:00.320 --> 36:05.240
He brought drug flavored drugs and I'd paid him money for them and then he had money and

36:05.240 --> 36:07.720
I had drugs and now some of them are in the trash can.

36:07.720 --> 36:13.440
Stop calling yourself a friend that has drugs when your friends have money and want drugs.

36:13.440 --> 36:15.680
You're a drug dealer, man.

36:15.680 --> 36:16.680
Exactly.

36:16.680 --> 36:17.680
Own it.

36:17.680 --> 36:21.360
So he gave me he's given me a wide variety of like I like the more of the hallucinogenic

36:21.360 --> 36:26.400
thing and so he gives me mushrooms sometimes and he gave me some acid once and I took it

36:26.400 --> 36:28.680
too late and I fell asleep and don't sleep on acid.

36:28.680 --> 36:30.800
That's the worst.

36:30.800 --> 36:34.960
What happens when you sleep on a fucking incredible?

36:34.960 --> 36:36.520
I fell asleep on the couch.

36:36.520 --> 36:39.560
I watched cabaret, the movie.

36:39.560 --> 36:40.720
It's great.

36:40.720 --> 36:41.880
Like on acid.

36:41.880 --> 36:44.120
On acid, it was fantastic but then I fell asleep on the couch.

36:44.120 --> 36:45.120
Oh, cabaret on acid.

36:45.120 --> 36:46.120
Fucking do it.

36:46.120 --> 36:48.240
Ah, too demonic without the acid.

36:48.240 --> 36:49.240
Is it an aversion?

36:49.240 --> 36:50.240
Yeah.

36:50.240 --> 36:51.240
It starts up as like I had to hit pause.

36:51.240 --> 36:52.720
I'm like, I've seen this movie a hundred times.

36:52.720 --> 36:57.360
I'm like, I'm going to watch cabaret on acid and Joe Gray's face pops up in the first

36:57.360 --> 37:02.000
scene with a psh and his face was like this Ralph Steadham drawing.

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
It was fucking great.

37:04.000 --> 37:05.000
Oh yeah.

37:05.000 --> 37:11.840
So anyway, I fell asleep and I was still really going and you're inside this crazy

37:11.840 --> 37:17.520
fireball of imagery that's inside your eyelids.

37:17.520 --> 37:19.920
A champagne supernova?

37:19.920 --> 37:24.160
You have to keep opening your eyes to get back to where's the plant?

37:24.160 --> 37:25.160
Where's the TV?

37:25.160 --> 37:27.080
Like plant me somewhere.

37:27.080 --> 37:30.120
You're tripping with your eyes closed.

37:30.120 --> 37:31.120
Half asleep.

37:31.120 --> 37:32.120
Don't do it.

37:32.120 --> 37:33.240
I don't recommend that.

37:33.240 --> 37:35.720
And anyway, he came in one day and he goes, hey, I've got these things.

37:35.720 --> 37:36.720
I know you like mushrooms.

37:36.720 --> 37:37.720
He goes, I've got these.

37:37.720 --> 37:41.200
They look like little dove chocolate bars, little tiny ones that are wrapped in the

37:41.200 --> 37:42.200
red foil.

37:42.200 --> 37:44.800
They're kind of square and rounded on the top.

37:44.800 --> 37:49.800
They look exactly like that, like professional wrapping dove chocolates.

37:49.800 --> 37:54.360
And he goes, these are mushroom and a little marijuana.

37:54.360 --> 37:58.440
I'm like, OK, that sounds pretty groovy.

37:58.440 --> 38:02.080
Where's the medicine that counteracts the...

38:02.080 --> 38:04.880
Steve, bring the ice and such.

38:04.880 --> 38:05.880
OK, now continue.

38:05.880 --> 38:06.880
Vodka, please.

38:06.880 --> 38:08.200
Just a little advertisement there.

38:08.200 --> 38:09.200
I got you.

38:09.200 --> 38:10.200
No, yeah, yeah.

38:10.200 --> 38:11.200
With the umlauts.

38:11.200 --> 38:12.200
With the umlauts.

38:12.200 --> 38:13.200
Pop I Need to Spin It, baby.

38:13.200 --> 38:14.200
You gotta fucking have that fucking.

38:14.200 --> 38:18.040
This show is tragically brought to you by alcohol.

38:18.040 --> 38:19.040
Kettle one.

38:19.040 --> 38:20.040
Hello, Steve Levy.

38:20.040 --> 38:21.040
Steve Levy, everybody.

38:21.040 --> 38:22.040
Steve Levy.

38:22.040 --> 38:25.120
Steve Levy is in episode three of Dope State.

38:25.120 --> 38:29.320
Check out Steve Levy in a very tight turtleneck, looking like...

38:29.320 --> 38:32.040
How are we supposed to see your show?

38:32.040 --> 38:34.040
Let's sponsor your story with his show.

38:34.040 --> 38:35.040
Oh, yeah, yeah.

38:35.040 --> 38:36.040
How are we supposed to see it?

38:36.040 --> 38:37.040
Pluto TV.

38:37.040 --> 38:41.520
Pluto TV, you can get the app, or you can go to Pluto.tv, but get the app and go to

38:41.520 --> 38:46.320
Channel 420 every Friday for the next five weeks.

38:46.320 --> 38:49.640
Every Friday at 420, you can see a new episode of Dope State.

38:49.640 --> 38:53.040
And then at the end of that, it'll be on all the VOD ports and such.

38:53.040 --> 38:54.040
Hell yeah.

38:54.040 --> 38:58.880
And our promos will be Jeff Davis singing Cabaret.

38:58.880 --> 39:03.240
What good is staying alone in your room?

39:03.240 --> 39:04.240
That's the finale.

39:04.240 --> 39:05.240
That's not the beginning.

39:05.240 --> 39:09.600
Were you tripping out when all the little blonde Nazi boys were walking in a line in

39:09.600 --> 39:10.600
the movie?

39:10.600 --> 39:11.600
Yeah.

39:11.600 --> 39:14.040
Tomato belongs to me, but that's fucking good.

39:14.040 --> 39:20.080
I've never seen Cabaret, because if I wanted to take acid, I'd take acid.

39:20.080 --> 39:24.600
I see the commercials for it, and he's like, maybe Envenu.

39:24.600 --> 39:27.640
And I'm like, no, I won't do it.

39:27.640 --> 39:29.040
I'm already scared of life.

39:29.040 --> 39:31.440
My parents took me...

39:31.440 --> 39:36.000
I saw that with Joel Gray at the Music Center.

39:36.000 --> 39:37.960
He goes to see his own shows?

39:37.960 --> 39:38.960
No, no.

39:38.960 --> 39:39.960
I went to go see...

39:39.960 --> 39:40.960
Wow.

39:40.960 --> 39:41.960
I went to go see...

39:41.960 --> 39:42.960
With my parents.

39:42.960 --> 39:44.200
I was six or seven years old.

39:44.200 --> 39:50.160
We went to go to see everything, big plays that came to LA.

39:50.160 --> 39:58.320
I was sitting there seven years old, six years old, and it's about Nazis and lesbians and

39:58.320 --> 39:59.320
abortions.

39:59.320 --> 40:04.200
I remember looking at my parents, like, this really isn't for me.

40:04.200 --> 40:08.640
I didn't know what any of it meant, but I remember thinking the people sitting near

40:08.640 --> 40:11.240
me, they're going to be like, there's a kid right here.

40:11.240 --> 40:13.440
And the way home, I'm in the car...

40:13.440 --> 40:18.360
It was a song about Monge Toie, and my parents were just laughing.

40:18.360 --> 40:19.360
I remember that.

40:19.360 --> 40:20.360
I had no idea what it was.

40:20.360 --> 40:22.800
So anyway, the guy comes in with these chocolates.

40:22.800 --> 40:26.760
And I buy the chocolates and I take the chocolate and I thought...

40:26.760 --> 40:34.520
Oh, I didn't like it, because the mushroom thing happens, but then the weed comes in.

40:34.520 --> 40:35.520
The edible thing came in.

40:35.520 --> 40:36.960
But you were on acid and tea?

40:36.960 --> 40:37.960
No, no, no.

40:37.960 --> 40:38.960
This is different.

40:38.960 --> 40:39.960
Okay, different time.

40:39.960 --> 40:40.960
Different thing.

40:40.960 --> 40:42.480
It's not a good story.

40:42.480 --> 40:47.400
I tried them twice, and I didn't like them, because the weed part, unlike you, weed fucks

40:47.400 --> 40:48.400
me up.

40:48.400 --> 40:50.840
I get way too affected by marijuana.

40:50.840 --> 40:57.600
I smoke my fair share of weed, and I can get down, but I...

40:57.600 --> 40:58.600
You're still cool?

40:58.600 --> 41:00.080
Yeah, I'm still cool.

41:00.080 --> 41:01.080
You still got it?

41:01.080 --> 41:03.960
I don't want to be distracted by this for the rest of the night, but I can help you with

41:03.960 --> 41:04.960
that story.

41:04.960 --> 41:07.560
I'm kind of like a Hollywood script doctor.

41:07.560 --> 41:08.560
Whoa.

41:08.560 --> 41:09.560
But if you want to...

41:09.560 --> 41:10.560
No, no, no, no.

41:10.560 --> 41:12.800
If you want to meet about it, if you want to put something together, like I'm between

41:12.800 --> 41:15.520
projects, I've failed at all the other ones, and so...

41:15.520 --> 41:19.560
Okay, this is Dan Harmon, punches up Jeff's edible story.

41:19.560 --> 41:21.800
Oh, I just want to put my hat in the ring.

41:21.800 --> 41:22.800
Oh.

41:22.800 --> 41:23.800
All right.

41:23.800 --> 41:28.160
Well, look, I want to work with you on finding the...

41:28.160 --> 41:29.160
Okay.

41:29.160 --> 41:31.560
Why don't we all kind of bang it out together right now?

41:31.560 --> 41:32.560
Yeah.

41:32.560 --> 41:33.560
Okay.

41:33.560 --> 41:34.560
So you...

41:34.560 --> 41:36.560
And were you finished?

41:36.560 --> 41:41.720
Because I didn't want to...

41:41.720 --> 41:43.680
I'm not going to interrupt the flow now.

41:43.680 --> 41:44.680
No, no, no.

41:44.680 --> 41:49.520
And the unspoken part of that is, unlike you, Dan, I'm not a flow.

41:49.520 --> 41:50.520
I'm not a flow interrupter.

41:50.520 --> 41:51.520
Damn.

41:51.520 --> 41:57.520
Or are you telling me that I'm somehow able to reverse project shaming?

41:57.520 --> 42:04.600
Because then I think I'd be a superhero if I could take anything that you said and turn

42:04.600 --> 42:07.760
it into me feeling bad about myself.

42:07.760 --> 42:14.840
I mean, I'd be out there fighting crime right now because who wouldn't want that power?

42:14.840 --> 42:16.120
Reverse projecting shame?

42:16.120 --> 42:23.080
I can turn... I could find shame in... I've never thought about trying to use it for good.

42:23.080 --> 42:25.760
I will find shame in anything.

42:25.760 --> 42:26.760
Okay.

42:26.760 --> 42:29.360
It's not a challenge.

42:29.360 --> 42:31.280
This area of rug beneath your feet.

42:31.280 --> 42:37.520
It reminds me of the fact that I don't know enough about carpet and that the last time

42:37.520 --> 42:44.040
I was in like an Ikea, I saw like a rack of rugs and I was like, maybe I need a rug.

42:44.040 --> 42:49.400
And then I was like, I don't know anything about rugs and kind of ran away from the...

42:49.400 --> 42:51.400
And I was like 25 and I was in an Ikea.

42:51.400 --> 42:54.080
That's a time to just grab a rug, man.

42:54.080 --> 43:00.600
Like I fucking missed my life because I didn't want to buy a rug wrong.

43:00.600 --> 43:02.160
That's fucking sick.

43:02.160 --> 43:10.320
What about when my mother told me that I was the only person that mattered to her and she

43:10.320 --> 43:15.600
was coming out of a drug trip and we got through it together and we sang and cried together.

43:15.600 --> 43:18.080
Oh, you wanted my shame in that?

43:18.080 --> 43:19.880
I thought you were... I was like...

43:19.880 --> 43:20.880
You looked at me like...

43:20.880 --> 43:21.880
I know.

43:21.880 --> 43:25.440
I thought you were going to share your... And then my mom turned to me and said, I really

43:25.440 --> 43:31.680
wish that you had pursued architecture and you walked out into the front lawn and you

43:31.680 --> 43:42.800
heard a single gunshot and a church bell.

43:42.800 --> 43:43.800
There wasn't even a church.

43:43.800 --> 43:49.480
Did I ever say on stage, I think I did say it, just the heart of man, we're like the

43:49.480 --> 43:54.080
community writer's room, they remember the episode where Abed takes the class taught

43:54.080 --> 43:58.400
by the guy who's going to teach you who was the boss.

43:58.400 --> 44:05.320
And I think I'm not... I know I've said this publicly before, but probably not a lot.

44:05.320 --> 44:13.440
But we had so much... Abed finishes with the guy, he beats him, he figures out who the

44:13.440 --> 44:22.720
boss was and he walks out of the class having bested his teacher and we really wanted to

44:22.720 --> 44:28.000
have him walking across the quad and you hear bells, but then you also just hear this single

44:28.000 --> 44:30.160
gunshot.

44:30.160 --> 44:35.240
There's a shot of Stephen Toblowski in the episode, so I have receipts for this because

44:35.240 --> 44:41.440
there's a shot of him opening a drawer and looking at what was really happening.

44:41.440 --> 44:42.440
We switched that out.

44:42.440 --> 44:47.360
That was me and Chris McKenna going like, well, we got to put something in the drawer.

44:47.360 --> 44:49.480
It was going to be a gun.

44:49.480 --> 44:50.480
And I think there's a gun in the drawer.

44:50.480 --> 44:54.920
I think there is a gun, but it's a joke because he pushes it and then finds the book or something.

44:54.920 --> 44:58.880
Okay, okay, he pushes the gun at it. Boy, that wouldn't even fly today.

44:58.880 --> 45:03.960
Guns aren't even funny, it's like it wouldn't even be...

45:03.960 --> 45:06.440
I think it would have been awesome.

45:06.440 --> 45:10.640
But anyway, we were really struggling with that.

45:10.640 --> 45:14.360
You can't... I pitched it and everyone was like, you got to do that with having Abed

45:14.360 --> 45:17.720
walk across the quad and you just hear a single gunshot.

45:17.720 --> 45:23.400
The important thing is Abed doesn't turn his head.

45:23.400 --> 45:28.680
He stops and pauses and then keeps walking.

45:28.680 --> 45:30.920
Doesn't that happen though?

45:30.920 --> 45:33.480
I could be like, there's no gunshot, but doesn't he...

45:33.480 --> 45:37.000
I thought maybe I'm just misremembering, but I thought he does like there's a time where

45:37.000 --> 45:39.280
he's walking and then he stops, but there's just...

45:39.280 --> 45:40.280
You don't hear a gunshot.

45:40.280 --> 45:41.920
Maybe we shot it and we just didn't do the gunshot.

45:41.920 --> 45:42.920
Yeah, I can't remember.

45:42.920 --> 45:43.920
Oh my God. Damn.

45:43.920 --> 45:44.920
Yeah, that's...

45:44.920 --> 45:45.920
Yeah, my mother shot herself that night.

45:45.920 --> 45:46.920
All right.

45:46.920 --> 45:47.920
I'm sorry.

45:47.920 --> 45:48.920
I'm sorry.

45:48.920 --> 45:49.920
Sorry about that.

45:49.920 --> 45:50.920
You know...

45:50.920 --> 45:51.920
How can I turn that into shame?

45:51.920 --> 45:55.480
I mean, I don't have a healthy relationship with my mother.

45:55.480 --> 45:56.480
That's easy.

45:56.480 --> 45:59.200
Like, oh, how can you take this beautiful thing and turn it into shame?

45:59.200 --> 46:00.200
That's a fucking...

46:00.200 --> 46:02.760
You turn it upside down.

46:02.760 --> 46:03.760
Sure.

46:03.760 --> 46:04.760
Sure.

46:04.760 --> 46:05.760
How do you make this smile unhappy?

46:05.760 --> 46:12.280
Like, by being a fucking barbarian of shame, by using brute happiness inversion.

46:12.280 --> 46:13.280
Very simple.

46:13.280 --> 46:14.520
Oh, you were happy?

46:14.520 --> 46:16.920
Well, I should have been.

46:16.920 --> 46:17.920
Done.

46:17.920 --> 46:19.880
Oh, that rainbow's pretty.

46:19.880 --> 46:21.760
I'm not.

46:21.760 --> 46:23.280
That's shame 101.

46:23.280 --> 46:26.160
Like, I mean, fucking...

46:26.160 --> 46:30.120
I want to say challenge me, but I'm afraid you'll challenge me and I'll look like a

46:30.120 --> 46:33.720
horrible person because I should look like that.

46:33.720 --> 46:34.720
I'm a monster.

46:34.720 --> 46:35.720
Okay.

46:35.720 --> 46:37.640
What about the moon landing?

46:37.640 --> 46:40.920
I feel bad that the podcast isn't about going to the moon anymore.

46:40.920 --> 46:41.920
Nice.

46:41.920 --> 46:42.920
Wow.

46:42.920 --> 46:43.920
Master.

46:43.920 --> 46:45.440
I didn't realize I threw you a lob on that one.

46:45.440 --> 46:48.720
We had something go in there and you did what you always do, Daniel.

46:48.720 --> 46:49.720
We did that for like...

46:49.720 --> 46:50.720
Fucked it up, yeah.

46:50.720 --> 46:53.880
You can't just leave well enough alone.

46:53.880 --> 46:54.880
You got to overthink.

46:54.880 --> 46:55.880
You got to change.

46:55.880 --> 46:56.880
You got to evolve.

46:56.880 --> 47:00.600
You're just like, you're a moving target with a gun to your head.

47:00.600 --> 47:01.600
No one cares.

47:01.600 --> 47:03.600
Stop moving.

47:03.600 --> 47:06.040
Or put the gun down.

47:06.040 --> 47:12.560
So Gabe, what streaming media do you think that...

47:12.560 --> 47:17.200
With no more Nielsen's, like, how will we reach the youth?

47:17.200 --> 47:23.120
Oh, wait, I do have a point about that.

47:23.120 --> 47:24.120
Whoa.

47:24.120 --> 47:27.840
The service that we're on, does anybody here have Pluto TV?

47:27.840 --> 47:28.840
Pluto TV.

47:28.840 --> 47:29.840
All right.

47:29.840 --> 47:30.840
There we go.

47:30.840 --> 47:31.840
One guy.

47:31.840 --> 47:32.840
One guy who may be lying.

47:32.840 --> 47:33.840
He's got...

47:33.840 --> 47:34.840
No offense.

47:34.840 --> 47:35.840
If he is...

47:35.840 --> 47:36.840
Well, anyways, continue.

47:36.840 --> 47:37.840
Please don't.

47:37.840 --> 47:38.840
I don't...

47:38.840 --> 47:43.240
If you're in Los Angeles or New York and you're listening to this right now, they're

47:43.240 --> 47:48.720
doing this huge press push port of just ads everywhere and it's free TV and it's the next

47:48.720 --> 47:54.520
generation of entertainment and you go on it and it looks just like cable, right?

47:54.520 --> 47:58.880
You scan through and it's got commercials and so it's like, oh, that's the system is

47:58.880 --> 48:00.720
like commercials.

48:00.720 --> 48:03.100
It's free TV because you've got commercials.

48:03.100 --> 48:07.320
So I think that's the next step is like just cycling back to where we were.

48:07.320 --> 48:09.240
We used to call that TV.

48:09.240 --> 48:10.240
Right.

48:10.240 --> 48:13.320
It's like cycling back, yeah, to...

48:13.320 --> 48:14.320
Yeah, yeah.

48:14.320 --> 48:19.800
Well, it would only be like the old days of the media providers somehow merged until

48:19.800 --> 48:22.800
there were only three of them.

48:22.800 --> 48:27.080
That's never going to happen because the internet...

48:27.080 --> 48:28.920
Is it all original content or is that good?

48:28.920 --> 48:30.120
No, it's like a good mix.

48:30.120 --> 48:33.840
You can watch like America's Most Wanted and then you can go see like an NUR2 film.

48:33.840 --> 48:35.560
They've got like a pretty interesting...

48:35.560 --> 48:40.200
They got like a pretty interesting layer of things and channels are like, you know, weed

48:40.200 --> 48:43.000
or slow motion or like animals or whatever.

48:43.000 --> 48:44.680
Like it's more like thematically like...

48:44.680 --> 48:45.680
Slow motion?

48:45.680 --> 48:47.400
Yeah, there's a slow...

48:47.400 --> 48:49.200
It's called slow.

48:49.200 --> 48:52.600
Like so like kind of satisfying kind of videos or...

48:52.600 --> 48:55.600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

48:55.600 --> 48:57.600
That's awesome.

48:57.600 --> 49:03.000
I don't work for this company.

49:03.000 --> 49:06.000
I could have pitched that way better if I...

49:06.000 --> 49:10.400
If you look, I mean, now I either want to watch it or I'm never going to...

49:10.400 --> 49:11.400
I want to watch it.

49:11.400 --> 49:12.400
The stakes got really high.

49:12.400 --> 49:13.400
You were like...

49:13.400 --> 49:14.400
The commercials are slow.

49:14.400 --> 49:18.120
You were painted in a corner there on your advocacy of slow.

49:18.120 --> 49:19.120
It just seems cool.

49:19.120 --> 49:20.120
I don't know.

49:20.120 --> 49:21.120
No, it's cool.

49:21.120 --> 49:22.120
And they got supermarket sweepstakes.

49:22.120 --> 49:23.120
That's good.

49:23.120 --> 49:24.120
Oh, yeah?

49:24.120 --> 49:25.120
Yeah, yeah.

49:25.120 --> 49:26.120
They got good stuff.

49:26.120 --> 49:27.120
Oh, so yes.

49:27.120 --> 49:30.360
See, I went a trip to Rome with Matt Gurley on Shop to Your Drop and everyone confuses

49:30.360 --> 49:31.360
it with supermarket sweep.

49:31.360 --> 49:32.360
I'm like, no.

49:32.360 --> 49:33.360
No, yeah.

49:33.360 --> 49:34.360
Yeah, they do.

49:34.360 --> 49:35.360
She's livid.

49:35.360 --> 49:36.360
What are you guessing about?

49:36.360 --> 49:37.360
She's excited.

49:37.360 --> 49:38.360
Oh, yeah.

49:38.360 --> 49:39.360
Yeah.

49:39.360 --> 49:40.720
Well, you're going to love Dope State.

49:40.720 --> 49:43.160
It's nothing like either one of them.

49:43.160 --> 49:47.400
It was shot 20 years later.

49:47.400 --> 49:50.960
He had both of her hands on there freaking out about Shop to Your Drop and Supermarket

49:50.960 --> 49:51.960
Sweep.

49:51.960 --> 49:52.960
Yeah, you were...

49:52.960 --> 49:53.960
I mean, you hit her...

49:53.960 --> 49:54.960
It was like a one, two, two.

49:54.960 --> 49:55.960
I heard her in David.

49:55.960 --> 49:56.960
She went, yes.

49:56.960 --> 49:58.320
And then that was like a step up.

49:58.320 --> 49:59.320
And then it was like...

49:59.320 --> 50:00.320
I got it.

50:00.320 --> 50:05.560
I mean, I got it when you said after... Yes, and they're just like, yes.

50:05.560 --> 50:06.560
Right.

50:06.560 --> 50:09.000
Like, why is he talking about both of them?

50:09.000 --> 50:14.120
Because, I mean, it makes sense that you'd maybe be a connoisseur, right, of like shopping...

50:14.120 --> 50:18.800
They ran back to the back so you'd watch the whole hour, right?

50:18.800 --> 50:19.800
Yeah, yeah.

50:19.800 --> 50:20.800
Me and my friend...

50:20.800 --> 50:21.800
I'm going to interview you.

50:21.800 --> 50:22.800
I'm like, what's your...

50:22.800 --> 50:27.800
What do you like so much about shopping carts?

50:27.800 --> 50:28.800
What's...

50:28.800 --> 50:30.800
What drugs do your mom do?

50:30.800 --> 50:32.800
What is your mom...

50:32.800 --> 50:33.800
Bring up on stage.

50:33.800 --> 50:34.800
Come up on stage, shopping person.

50:34.800 --> 50:44.560
If you'd like to come up, you can, but you don't have to if you don't want to.

50:44.560 --> 50:45.560
Danielle, everybody.

50:45.560 --> 50:47.560
Danielle, have a seat.

50:47.560 --> 50:50.560
Oh, God.

50:50.560 --> 50:51.560
You don't have to stay up here, Danielle.

50:51.560 --> 50:53.760
I just thought it'd be funny.

50:53.760 --> 50:56.880
Jeff Leans toured bringing people up.

50:56.880 --> 51:00.680
He's like, he knows it can lead to magic.

51:00.680 --> 51:03.760
What show brought you here that you spent two years of your life making?

51:03.760 --> 51:05.560
How did you earn your way to this...

51:05.560 --> 51:07.880
How did you earn your way to this stage?

51:07.880 --> 51:08.880
Oh.

51:08.880 --> 51:09.880
I hate...

51:09.880 --> 51:10.880
Listen, I work...

51:10.880 --> 51:11.880
We all get jealous.

51:11.880 --> 51:15.880
I actually work for a supermarket, so both of the shows...

51:15.880 --> 51:16.880
Whoa.

51:16.880 --> 51:17.880
Do you sweep?

51:17.880 --> 51:18.880
I sweep so hard.

51:18.880 --> 51:19.880
Hell yeah.

51:19.880 --> 51:20.880
What's your title at the supermarket?

51:20.880 --> 51:21.880
If I can ask.

51:21.880 --> 51:22.880
I'm a human resource manager.

51:22.880 --> 51:23.880
Whoa.

51:23.880 --> 51:27.880
You're in charge of all the employees, whether they have...

51:27.880 --> 51:28.880
It's HR.

51:28.880 --> 51:29.880
It's human resources.

51:29.880 --> 51:30.880
Yeah.

51:30.880 --> 51:31.880
They have complaints.

51:31.880 --> 51:32.880
Oh, I hate it.

51:32.880 --> 51:36.880
Do you have to come down on them, though, if they're not working hard enough, or do you

51:36.880 --> 51:37.880
just...

51:37.880 --> 51:38.880
Yeah, you're who they send in when they get fired, right?

51:38.880 --> 51:39.880
You're the fire person?

51:39.880 --> 51:40.880
Yeah.

51:40.880 --> 51:41.880
I'm the hiring and firing person.

51:41.880 --> 51:44.520
So I hire them and then fire them.

51:44.520 --> 51:48.880
How do you fire someone without sucking your thumb and throwing a tantrum and...

51:48.880 --> 51:52.880
The store manager actually does this, so I just sit there and just yes him.

51:52.880 --> 51:54.880
Do you just make sure he says it like that?

51:54.880 --> 51:55.880
Yeah.

51:55.880 --> 51:56.880
This guy knows.

51:56.880 --> 51:57.880
Make sure he's PC about it.

51:57.880 --> 52:04.880
When they fire someone at this establishment, is there a ritual to it?

52:04.880 --> 52:05.880
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

52:05.880 --> 52:09.880
You have to make sure it's legit reason.

52:09.880 --> 52:11.880
Right, because they could sue, right?

52:11.880 --> 52:12.880
Yes.

52:12.880 --> 52:13.880
Oh yeah.

52:13.880 --> 52:14.880
There's that...

52:14.880 --> 52:15.880
Good point, Jeff.

52:15.880 --> 52:16.880
It's horrible.

52:16.880 --> 52:17.880
I don't know where I'm looking.

52:17.880 --> 52:18.880
Sorry.

52:18.880 --> 52:19.880
No, no, no.

52:19.880 --> 52:20.880
People do that all the time.

52:20.880 --> 52:22.880
They accept it as a dynamic of the stage.

52:22.880 --> 52:23.880
It's no one's fault.

52:23.880 --> 52:24.880
I'm just hearing things.

52:24.880 --> 52:25.880
No, you're doing great.

52:25.880 --> 52:26.880
You're doing great.

52:26.880 --> 52:27.880
But it's got to be like by the...

52:27.880 --> 52:31.880
Like I was fired from Baskin Robbins, Togo's Baskin Robbins because I was taking too many

52:31.880 --> 52:35.880
samples for myself, so I stole ice cream or whatever.

52:35.880 --> 52:36.880
Yes.

52:36.880 --> 52:40.880
And so, like, does it ever feel like you're being pushed to like put someone in a box?

52:40.880 --> 52:44.880
Like, oh, they're not allowed to do this specific thing, so they were like doing it?

52:44.880 --> 52:46.880
Like, you know, it has to be by the book, right?

52:46.880 --> 52:47.880
Do you ever like put people in that book?

52:47.880 --> 52:48.880
No, no, no, no.

52:48.880 --> 52:49.880
I mean, why would you admit to that?

52:49.880 --> 52:50.880
I suppose.

52:50.880 --> 52:51.880
Yeah.

52:51.880 --> 52:52.880
You know what I find interesting though?

52:52.880 --> 52:57.320
Because like Sony would send a lawyer every year on a Sony show.

52:57.320 --> 53:01.440
They send a lawyer to like give you a talk about like what's constitutional and what's

53:01.440 --> 53:02.440
not and stuff.

53:02.440 --> 53:05.080
But it's weird because it's coming from their perspective because it's like about what's

53:05.080 --> 53:09.060
going to protect them because you don't sue any higher than them.

53:09.060 --> 53:11.440
So if someone sues me and then they...

53:11.440 --> 53:12.440
But there's not...

53:12.440 --> 53:13.440
It's not worth it, blah, blah, blah.

53:13.440 --> 53:19.860
So Sony has this vested interest in like explaining when it's okay to fire someone and when it's

53:19.860 --> 53:26.280
not, what I find fascinating is like of course you can't fire someone because of this whole

53:26.280 --> 53:32.880
list of constitutionally protected attributes, but you can fire someone because you don't

53:32.880 --> 53:36.320
like the look of their face.

53:36.320 --> 53:37.320
You just have to specify, right?

53:37.320 --> 53:39.520
You just have to be like, yeah, I don't like them.

53:39.520 --> 53:42.360
I don't like their personality.

53:42.360 --> 53:43.360
Isn't that true?

53:43.360 --> 53:46.360
Like you don't need like a good reason to fire someone.

53:46.360 --> 53:52.200
There's just like a category of reasons that are illegal.

53:52.200 --> 53:57.000
We only fire someone if they're stealing or stealing.

53:57.000 --> 53:58.000
That's it?

53:58.000 --> 53:59.760
That's the two things?

53:59.760 --> 54:05.480
So if somebody's fucking on the apples, they're stealing hygiene.

54:05.480 --> 54:10.280
If a customer complains enough, we have to let them go.

54:10.280 --> 54:11.280
So Dan's incorrect.

54:11.280 --> 54:14.480
You can't fire someone because you don't like the look of their face, which is based on

54:14.480 --> 54:15.480
what?

54:15.480 --> 54:17.680
So where did you get that idea that that's a thing?

54:17.680 --> 54:20.640
I thought that was the message I got from Sony told you that?

54:20.640 --> 54:21.640
Yeah.

54:21.640 --> 54:26.400
Because they walk you through these scenarios where they're like, so-and-so wants to fire

54:26.400 --> 54:34.160
so-and-so, but it was sort of like, they didn't say, here's what you say if you want to fire

54:34.160 --> 54:38.280
them, but they're kind of like, is this guy firing her for, you know, I was like, why

54:38.280 --> 54:40.720
are there genders known?

54:40.720 --> 54:47.120
There's no women at this meeting about how to fire women.

54:47.120 --> 54:50.800
Is weed one of the things that you can fire people from if they smoke weed?

54:50.800 --> 54:57.320
So we can't accuse someone of being intoxicated or high, but if we smell them, we can be like,

54:57.320 --> 55:00.360
hey, if they admit to it, then we can fire them.

55:00.360 --> 55:03.400
Oh, I dodged a bullet.

55:03.400 --> 55:07.360
No, but technically.

55:07.360 --> 55:09.360
Technically bearded man with a hat.

55:09.360 --> 55:11.400
Getting mad about the weed.

55:11.400 --> 55:15.880
If you, if the same thing as being intoxicated at work, if you are high or intoxicated and

55:15.880 --> 55:17.800
you admit to it, then we can fire you.

55:17.800 --> 55:21.120
Do you ever, do you ever like, hey, be real with me?

55:21.120 --> 55:22.120
No.

55:22.120 --> 55:23.120
You know?

55:23.120 --> 55:24.120
I'm like, listen.

55:24.120 --> 55:25.120
Listen, David.

55:25.120 --> 55:34.840
I'll take my HR hat off and then they're like, yeah, I did a J in the parking lot.

55:34.840 --> 55:37.960
Just to be cool and you're like, well, two things you need to know.

55:37.960 --> 55:39.200
That's not cool.

55:39.200 --> 55:42.560
And the hat's always on.

55:42.560 --> 55:47.680
You're out of here fucking pot face with your head.

55:47.680 --> 55:49.840
I don't know your drug terms.

55:49.840 --> 55:55.320
Danielle, so if someone comes in, their eyes are glassy and red and they smell like weed

55:55.320 --> 56:01.960
and you go, excuse me, are you intoxicated on the marijuana's and they go, no, man.

56:01.960 --> 56:02.960
I can't do nothing.

56:02.960 --> 56:03.960
I can't do anything.

56:03.960 --> 56:04.960
Really?

56:04.960 --> 56:05.960
That's awesome.

56:05.960 --> 56:06.960
I love that.

56:06.960 --> 56:12.880
So I'm here for a job at a children's museum exhibit with Sean McKenna.

56:12.880 --> 56:14.200
I don't think I've ever told this story.

56:14.200 --> 56:15.200
Oh, shit.

56:15.200 --> 56:16.200
That's why I'm excited.

56:16.200 --> 56:19.400
Because I'm like, wow, that's one I don't think I've ever told because I'm so deeply

56:19.400 --> 56:26.160
ashamed of it that I went with, you know, I'm doing improv troops and I'm just like

56:26.160 --> 56:31.880
living the life of like, I use most of my paycheck to buy weed and then to buy gas to

56:31.880 --> 56:37.240
get to do more shows and I'm just kind of living the fucking pre-panic attack life.

56:37.240 --> 56:38.240
It's great.

56:38.240 --> 56:42.840
Do you have it?

56:42.840 --> 56:49.520
Hurry up and remember why you interrupted everyone and tell your fucking thing.

56:49.520 --> 56:54.840
My buddy, Sean, was like, I mean, that was, I was his roommate.

56:54.840 --> 56:59.600
I lived in his attic when I was at the peak of that phase and I was like, he and I were

56:59.600 --> 57:04.640
like in the kind of category of like, well, you can have lots of shows because you're

57:04.640 --> 57:09.360
the only ones guaranteed to be home when we call, like everyone else is like trying to

57:09.360 --> 57:11.000
be an adult.

57:11.000 --> 57:16.360
So like you guys are like really dedicated to improv and in Eric what's meaning you're

57:16.360 --> 57:21.480
like you fucking on the couch straight up and like, I think that he and I never talked

57:21.480 --> 57:27.040
about it, but afterward, because I think we both really didn't, we didn't want to face

57:27.040 --> 57:31.880
this, but like we, I remember we got this opportunity through some mutual friends of

57:31.880 --> 57:32.880
ours.

57:32.880 --> 57:36.800
So they're like, hey, they're adding this thing at the museum and the children's wing,

57:36.800 --> 57:43.320
like they want to do these like fucking what's his name, boat to Bill Nye kind of things

57:43.320 --> 57:47.640
like based on the popularity at that time of like, hey, science is cool and they want

57:47.640 --> 57:51.720
to add like live shows and do like a Beekman thing or something at this thing.

57:51.720 --> 57:55.680
And it was like, oh, this will be cool and they're having open auditions and me and Sean

57:55.680 --> 57:56.680
went in.

57:56.680 --> 58:00.360
And we talked about it for a while and we were like, well, let's do this and that.

58:00.360 --> 58:04.080
We came up with an audition and we went in and we're like, boy, this, I was thinking

58:04.080 --> 58:08.040
in my head like, like, you never know, you never know which of these little stepping

58:08.040 --> 58:11.760
stones is going to be the thing you look back on you go, well, I used to just play Resident

58:11.760 --> 58:12.760
Evil.

58:12.760 --> 58:18.160
And then like all of a sudden I bought my first tie and that you don't know what's, what's

58:18.160 --> 58:19.680
that, what's that thing that's going to happen.

58:19.680 --> 58:23.280
And it just felt like it might be one of those, which makes me sound square because it makes

58:23.280 --> 58:28.040
me sound like my ambition was to get a tie and a business man like grow up.

58:28.040 --> 58:32.800
And I remember like, we did our thing and the, there were like four people in this like

58:32.800 --> 58:38.000
auditorium watching and I knew three of them because they're, it's like, yeah, but this

58:38.000 --> 58:43.080
is like, it's Milwaukee and, but this is how you move forward and it's like, I'm ready.

58:43.080 --> 58:44.080
Let's do this.

58:44.080 --> 58:45.800
And like, like, here's what I do.

58:45.800 --> 58:47.720
It's just like, it's an audition.

58:47.720 --> 58:52.400
There will be a script like this is our style and Sean and I played off each other and we,

58:52.400 --> 58:53.400
all right.

58:53.400 --> 58:54.400
Well, thank you.

58:54.400 --> 58:55.400
All right.

58:55.400 --> 58:56.400
See you later.

58:56.400 --> 58:57.400
We went home like a day later.

58:57.400 --> 59:02.080
One of the people that worked at the museum was like, hey, you guys, like, your audition

59:02.080 --> 59:03.080
was great.

59:03.080 --> 59:04.080
Like they loved you guys.

59:04.080 --> 59:05.080
That was amazing.

59:05.080 --> 59:08.480
I think you guys are so funny.

59:08.480 --> 59:16.160
You reeked so bad of marijuana and booze, like, like it was just coming off of you.

59:16.160 --> 59:22.160
There was just a cloud of pot and booze around you everywhere you went and everyone was

59:22.160 --> 59:29.760
like, could smell it and was all like, how hilarious is this that they're auditioning

59:29.760 --> 59:38.880
to teach children science and they smell like a fucking child ruin her.

59:38.880 --> 59:44.560
And I remember Sean and I like both just laughing about it going like, I guess we did smell

59:44.560 --> 59:49.440
like weed and that's why the system's not ready for us.

59:49.440 --> 59:53.960
But I can't speak for him, but I died a little inside.

59:53.960 --> 59:59.160
I was like, you, that was probably your last chance ever to do anything with your life.

59:59.160 --> 01:00:00.160
All right.

01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:03.560
Anyways, so how, all right, well, I have a question for Daniel.

01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:04.560
Okay.

01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:06.800
So you're in the room for these firings.

01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:13.160
Like, how ugly has it gotten to do people like throw stuff and freak out and people

01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:16.080
usually just admit to it and they're like, all right, see you later.

01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:17.080
Stealing.

01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:18.080
They admit to stealing.

01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:21.440
They're like, yeah, I did it or even don't they understand that's what you want them

01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:24.440
to do so you can get the power to fire them.

01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:25.440
Yeah.

01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:29.200
And they don't, they don't understand the concept of like, if you admit to it, you can't

01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:32.360
claim unemployment or do anything because you admitted to it.

01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:35.800
So I always get the emails from the lawyers being like, Hey, why'd you fire this person?

01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:40.280
Like they admitted to stealing or they admitted to being drunk or high and they don't get

01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:45.600
like, I don't understand why I didn't get unemployment because you admitted to just

01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:46.600
doing all these wrong things.

01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:50.040
Are you saying I could have gotten employment from my Togo's Baskin Robbins or not?

01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:51.040
Man.

01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:52.040
Yes.

01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:53.040
Only if you were a liar.

01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:54.040
Man.

01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:57.680
You needed to be a more dishonest person in the fiber of your being.

01:00:57.680 --> 01:01:04.760
If you ever get called in, just deny everything and I'm best friends with my loss prevention

01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:05.760
guy.

01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:08.240
So he always tells me like, if you ever get caught, just deny it.

01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:09.240
Damn.

01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:12.080
I feel like I'm going to be able to work with you to steal some TVs pretty soon.

01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:13.080
Let's go.

01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:16.560
They give you a physicals for insurance.

01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:23.480
When you're going to be involved in a TV production and everyone is like, don't tell

01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:24.480
them the truth.

01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:32.080
Everyone's like, they're like, it's not, I know you get the story about it.

01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:34.520
It's like they're mad at you if you tell the truth.

01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:36.000
You're going to cause everybody a bunch of trouble.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:39.120
I think that's why I never worked for that company again.

01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:45.240
Like I think I had a black mark on me for just saying, you mean to tell me, like look

01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:49.880
at our cast, nobody here has ever smoked a joint.

01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:53.240
No one here, like come on now.

01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:54.800
It is crazy to me.

01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:56.760
Well, that's their society.

01:01:56.760 --> 01:02:00.440
So they just like bald face lies, what everyone knows you're lying, that just works now.

01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:01.440
It's fine.

01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:02.960
You didn't know you're supposed to lie?

01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:05.960
That is really crazy to me.

01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:06.960
Maybe I've talked about this.

01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:11.560
When I was a big shoplifter in my college, I used to steal anything just for no reason

01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:16.600
and I stole books a lot from Barnes & Noble or another company.

01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:19.080
It could have been any company.

01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:20.080
Walden Books.

01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:21.080
I just forget.

01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:22.080
It was Borders.

01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:23.080
It was Borders.

01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:28.080
Because Borders was around when I was in college and no, it wasn't.

01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:32.200
At any rate, a friend of mine used to work there and he said, if you steal anything,

01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:36.160
even if they think or know that you're walking out of the store with something, we are not

01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:37.160
allowed to follow you.

01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:40.280
Yeah, they could call the cops and the cops don't know who you are, you're just gone.

01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:41.920
Yeah, and the cops don't care.

01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:45.760
Wait, you say that again.

01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:51.880
You could pick up a stack of books off the shelf and go, taking these and walk out of

01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:52.880
the store.

01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:53.880
They are not allowed to come out and get you.

01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:54.880
They can't touch you either.

01:02:54.880 --> 01:02:55.880
It's true.

01:02:55.880 --> 01:02:56.880
You're kidding.

01:02:56.880 --> 01:02:57.880
It's true.

01:02:57.880 --> 01:03:01.840
This is almost the opposite of what I was thinking would be the case, that they can't do anything

01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:05.240
to you in the store and they have to wait for you to leave at which point they'll tackle

01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:06.240
you.

01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:07.240
I bet I learned that from a fucking movie.

01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:09.240
They used to terrorize students.

01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:15.200
So once you leave the store, lost prevention go out and confront you and if you say, no,

01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:19.400
they can't touch you, they can't make you come back in the store and that's it.

01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:22.680
You can be like, okay, I'm calling the cops and they're like, all right, see you later.

01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:23.680
That's it.

01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:24.680
They can't do anything.

01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:29.560
I used to, I went through a shoplifting phase when I was like 22 and I got really into going

01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:35.680
to the Gelsons in Tarzana and I would walk in and I would go to the little cookie area,

01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:37.520
like the cookies and treats, right?

01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:43.240
I'd buy a nice tea so I bought something and then I'd go and get baguettes and sushi and

01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:49.640
butternut squash soup and I'd put it in the bag and I'd come sit with these old war veterans

01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:55.320
that used to hang out at the Gelsons in Tarzana at lunch and I was getting off on something,

01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:56.800
making up stories.

01:03:56.800 --> 01:04:00.640
I told them my name was something else and I would sit there and eat and...

01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:01.640
My name is Jean-Claude.

01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:07.480
Yeah, I was just lost in the valley and needed something in my day to do that.

01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:11.280
And one time they brought, and I did it for like a couple of weeks and it became like

01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:17.440
a thing and then Gelsons got an undercover guy and I was sitting there eating my sushi

01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:23.400
and cops rolled up on me and arrested me in front of my war veteran friends who were like,

01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:26.480
they picked me up and they're like, what did young Dylan do?

01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:29.080
He served this country.

01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:35.960
It was because I stole over $30 worth of stuff so it was an arrestable offense and they like

01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:39.720
hauled me away to the Van Nuys jail, which is like one of the worst.

01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:40.720
Oh no.

01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:41.720
It was awful.

01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:46.520
And I was in the cop car and I was being a little dick that the cop was like, so why

01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:47.520
did you do this?

01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:49.800
I was like, well, you know, I thought it'd be interesting to, you know, I'm writing something

01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:53.160
right now where somebody gets arrested and, you know, I'd be interested for...

01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:54.640
Just playing that cop angle.

01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:57.080
Like, you know the cop's gonna fucking love it.

01:04:57.080 --> 01:05:00.280
Oh, I got a Hollywood guy in the back seat.

01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:01.680
I love those.

01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:04.960
That's why I became a cop.

01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:09.640
He drops me off at Van Nuys jail and immediately I understood what the repercussions are.

01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:11.680
Like, I thought, even they didn't tell me I was going to jail.

01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:15.160
They thought, I thought I was going to get like booked at the thing and they'd write

01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:19.560
me a thing and he drops me off at the jail and the last thing, I turn back to him and

01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:22.800
he's like, good luck with that little research project there, buddy.

01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:32.280
And I'm like, does a finger get up and pass me, right in the leg and I go down and pull

01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:35.560
a tourniquet together.

01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:36.560
But it was there.

01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:38.800
They dropped me off on a Friday.

01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:43.400
So I'm in there and the lady at the thing is, she's like, so what, you know, and I'm

01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:44.400
like, how long am I gonna be here?

01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:48.160
She was like, well, it's Friday at the end of the day, so Saturday, Sunday, Monday's

01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:49.400
Martin Luther King day.

01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:52.920
So yeah, around like probably Tuesday, Wednesday.

01:05:52.920 --> 01:05:57.200
And I think I started crying and then they somehow got me out.

01:05:57.200 --> 01:05:58.200
Wait, what?

01:05:58.200 --> 01:05:59.200
Yeah.

01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:00.200
What in the privilege?

01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:06.640
I mean, we now got to just say it exactly what the lady said to me.

01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:07.640
She walked by me.

01:06:07.640 --> 01:06:13.960
I was standing at the blast, just TV and they're like sports and shit, which for my little

01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:19.960
queer heart was like, you know, and and and she was the lady walked by.

01:06:19.960 --> 01:06:24.640
She was like, you don't look like you belong here and she's like, what's your deal?

01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:30.080
I was like, I stole a baguette with a butternut squash with a lovely hint of lemon fresh and

01:06:30.080 --> 01:06:35.360
I don't know why I'm here and and they let and they and they let me out and I stole

01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:40.080
the I stole the jail pants and that was the last thing I ever stole.

01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:45.880
Now my mom's a drug dealer.

01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:49.560
I want to I want to bookend that with my mom does not want people to know that she was

01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:52.400
doing it was like nobody tell Gabe's mom okay.

01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:55.080
I'm trying to make no one find Gabe's okay.

01:06:55.080 --> 01:06:59.400
You know it's like it's fucking like Marin County like I don't think there could be anything

01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:00.400
wrong.

01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:01.400
Like everybody's growing it.

01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:02.400
All right.

01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:03.400
I'm okay.

01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:06.400
Marin County is like I used to go into a soup plantation and you guys are going to a soup

01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:07.400
plantation.

01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:08.400
I love it.

01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:18.680
She had supermarket sweep energy about it.

01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:19.680
Bring them up.

01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:20.680
Yeah.

01:07:20.680 --> 01:07:21.680
Come on.

01:07:21.680 --> 01:07:22.680
Come on.

01:07:22.680 --> 01:07:23.680
Come on.

01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:24.680
Get out of here.

01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:25.680
All right.

01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:26.680
This is the exuberant hour.

01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:27.680
What's your name?

01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:28.680
Oh.

01:07:28.680 --> 01:07:29.680
Oh God.

01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:30.680
It's Nova.

01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:33.160
Nova's back everybody.

01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:34.160
Soup plantation.

01:07:34.160 --> 01:07:35.160
I forgot Nova.

01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:39.080
I love a soup plantation when you go into a soup plantation if you're not hip to the

01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:45.280
jive you walk in you it starts with a salad bar then at the end of that salad bar you

01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:48.640
bring your tray and your plate up to a cash register and then beyond the cash register

01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:53.200
after you've paid it's hot items it's also it's hot stuff and cookies and brownies and

01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:58.920
soups and plantations and yes you can grow some cotton.

01:07:58.920 --> 01:08:02.480
I didn't know that you can go back to get more salad after you've sat down and stuff.

01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:03.480
Yeah.

01:08:03.480 --> 01:08:04.480
You go back to the salad.

01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:05.480
You have your receipt and run out.

01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:06.480
So I was broke.

01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:07.480
I was in college.

01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:10.680
I was still in my shoplifting stealing days and like I went to USC and stole just everything

01:08:10.680 --> 01:08:16.040
and from the from the commissary there what do you call it the place with the food and

01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:20.400
what I would do is I'd walk in without a plate I would walk past the cash register as I didn't

01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:24.280
have a plate and I would just say I just kind of look like I just kind of do like a point

01:08:24.280 --> 01:08:26.960
like I'm meeting a friend or whatever like I'm not eating I'm just coming in to sit with

01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:31.840
a pal or whatever and they didn't if you if you didn't have the iconic tray with the salad

01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:33.880
on it they didn't care about you.

01:08:33.880 --> 01:08:37.320
So I would just go in there and I would find a table that somebody had left and there were

01:08:37.320 --> 01:08:42.080
still plates on and I would just sit there and read and then after five minutes I looked

01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:46.440
like the guy they come over and they close the thing and they go hey was that iced tea

01:08:46.440 --> 01:08:51.480
I go yeah but I've had an iced tea let's get some water and they go okay yeah get a new

01:08:51.480 --> 01:08:53.080
plate walk I'll clear these for you.

01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:57.960
Slowly merge into the endless cycle that is the soup plantation lifestyle.

01:08:57.960 --> 01:09:01.920
And so then I would go up there and eat like crazy and then I would get started they go

01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:04.680
do you want anything to go but we just made a fresh batch of pizzas I mean yeah and then

01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:09.320
they'd wrap up pizza and foil so I would go there two three times a week and I kept doing

01:09:09.320 --> 01:09:14.280
it and once you get past the cash register all the servers and bus people and the people

01:09:14.280 --> 01:09:19.600
that are serving the food and whatnot they they don't care they assume that you paid

01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:21.560
because you wouldn't be able to be there.

01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:27.120
I went there so often they knew my name and they would like hey Jeff what's up man we

01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:31.320
just made a batch of brownies but we already wrapped them up for you.

01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:35.600
It's like it's like a fucking Tom Hanks movie for like the early thousands.

01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:39.720
A social engineered plantation like you're just stuck there because you don't have a

01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:42.000
green card.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.600
You help deliver a baby at one point.

01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:47.880
I actually I stopped going because I felt bad because they liked me there I didn't I

01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:49.080
didn't want them to be friends.

01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:53.720
Yeah it ends up like the CIA's got soup plantations surrounded and then but then every waiter

01:09:53.720 --> 01:10:00.200
like gives you the punches your soup card.

01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:04.320
The only time I got caught stealing and I stole a lot was at our supermarket I was at

01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:09.560
a Ralph's and I stole we were going to the beach and I stole like a two dollar thing

01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:14.080
of like a little pack of salami and cheese and I just did a little turn around and tuck

01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:20.160
it in my shorts like I always did and a hand grabs me and it's just a dude that was shopping

01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:27.120
there and he goes I saw you do that and he drags me he gets oh no he he he doesn't grab

01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:32.440
me by the arm yet he goes and comes with the manager at me and I'm apprehended and they

01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:37.480
go we saw you steal that I'm like what they dragged me off to the back room to the office

01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:42.120
and I'm just like shorts and a you know t-shirt and sandals or whatever like we're all going

01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:43.120
to the beach.

01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:44.760
I believe I had dreadlocks at this time.

01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:45.760
Hell yeah.

01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:46.760
Yeah because I was fucking awesome.

01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:47.760
Can't get this bunch.

01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:48.760
Is that a real thing?

01:10:48.760 --> 01:10:49.760
Did you have dreadlocks?

01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:50.760
Oh yeah.

01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:55.760
I want to play you in a show that sounds hilarious.

01:10:55.760 --> 01:11:01.080
So yeah so I was a good kid I get good grades.

01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:05.480
So I'm sitting in the manager's office and the cop he's an off-duty cop the guy.

01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:09.600
I thought he was just some vigilante guy he's an off-duty oh what are you a PD officer and

01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:14.160
he is fucking furious it's Saturday afternoon he's got nothing to do except harangue me

01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:18.440
and he's like you're going down to the fucking station buddy like I saw you do that and I'm

01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:21.480
looking I'm sitting there I got a cop yelling at me and the manager is like okay yeah we

01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:25.240

01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:35.440
going to arrest you for this and I said here's the thing officer fuckface I didn't take

01:11:35.440 --> 01:11:41.760
that I said I didn't leave the store there's no crime has been committed you're allowed

01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:46.200

01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:50.760
put your salami and cheese down my shorts I said it's gross and I shouldn't do that just

01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:54.480
to be a nice person but I haven't if you waited until I'd walked out with it then you have

01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:28.320
writer kind of I stopped stealing when I was 18 I didn't know a 17 year old could could muster a

01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:34.000
dreadlock how do you lock them I was I was always in like I was a bodyboarder and saw the salt water

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:37.600
and the sand gets in your hair and your hair just gets natty and like it just starts getting knotted

01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:42.720
is there any cultivation at all to it or is it well I have the process of energy so I was I

01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:47.840
twist my hair when it gets long and so that just kind of compounded I posted a photo of my my my

01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:52.880
senior your ID and I have kind of shitty dreadlocks in my face I almost had dreadlocks from like not

01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:57.760
washing it when I was in the Dominican Republic when I was like a kid you got very thick hair

01:15:57.760 --> 01:16:02.640
yeah it's really thick and it was long so it just it started dreading up and my mom was really mad

01:16:02.640 --> 01:16:07.280
yeah she had to comb it all right we're doing Game of Thrones predictions and we're and everyone's

01:16:07.280 --> 01:16:14.000
making one oh shit um I gotta get it on the record in case I'm right it's worth it if I'm wrong

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:19.680
who cares but like some I just keep going like come on I'm so convinced in all of my predictions

01:16:19.680 --> 01:16:25.120
that I don't want to give any of them because they're spoilers it seems like everybody feels

01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:30.560
like there's absolutely no way Lord Tarly on the on the on the throne I'm like you mean the fat

01:16:30.560 --> 01:16:38.800
writer character that just has everything go his way because his dad was wrong when he said

01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:46.160
you should be less fat and you should like writing less you don't think that you have you

01:16:46.160 --> 01:16:55.440
noticed that fucking foot pedal jamming during the fucking jazz club I was like by the way

01:16:55.440 --> 01:17:02.720
there's a fat writer and he gets fucking everything he wants and he's always right I think the

01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:08.320
finale of Game of Thrones is to be Lord Tarly like fucking mushing his ass like around like Megan

01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:16.880
and he's gonna like he's gonna like look at the camera and be like told you like like fucking

01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:22.400
happy birthday fucking bullies yeah but the Game of Thrones is gonna be put back in the new

01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:29.360
library what do they call that the the new library Citadel is it the Citadel it's gonna have an

01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:34.720
office at the Citadel with the throne the sword throne yeah I mean that was my only prediction

01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:39.360
I just it's one of those things where if people are like oh he'd never do that like but if he

01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:44.400
and also I guess he's different from the Game of Thrones writers too because they're two the last

01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:50.560
two seasons are them just making their own show right yeah hey Dan thanks for addressing Game of

01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:54.800
Thrones in your last episode I haven't been able to find a podcast that wanted to talk about Game

01:17:54.800 --> 01:18:01.520
of Thrones also social media has been a real Game of Thrones info desert um it's great that someone

01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:07.680
who hasn't watched any episodes this season could create an oasis for me to uh quench my thirst

01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:15.600
it's good seriously Game of Thrones fans 69 I haven't seen it I would guess hand of the king

01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:21.920
for him oh yeah that's my guess isn't it all just though going to be you know it's all the the

01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:27.120
first two were happy right I mean pretty much the first two these first two was like catch ups

01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:32.080
these first two they were like television to me the last one was pretty pretty gloomy everybody

01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:37.680
was like getting ready to die oh yeah and they were and they were and then and she got the thing

01:18:37.680 --> 01:18:41.600
and people were posting things of like crying like she's a knight one of the Rick and Morty

01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:45.040
writers pointed out that because I haven't seen the episodes but they're getting together and

01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:50.160
they're telling a lot of stories and gathering yeah and like the the overall message is like

01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:56.640
listen when this much shit happens like you got to look back and just be like god damn no

01:18:56.640 --> 01:19:04.640
matter how it turns out fuck this was amazing but good like you can't fucking get swept up in the

01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:10.960
in the in whatever happens next you got to fucking also remember we moved the needle bitch

01:19:10.960 --> 01:19:16.800
it was a real wild ride baby because I liked it like someone does a monologue about storytelling

01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:22.160
I think it's fat writer isn't it it was like stories yeah you know that's the fucking thing

01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:27.280
like history yeah I don't remember that I definitely remember the thing thinking like wow

01:19:27.280 --> 01:19:31.040
this girl was like seven when we met her and now she's doing this that was that was weird

01:19:31.680 --> 01:19:39.840
14 same thing you clocked it huh he's like four more years up on the dial another one fictional

01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:47.040
fictional countdown clock all right it's it's it's so much more perverse the fanfic countdown clock

01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:56.320
I can't wait till the third dragon age when she has acquired the spell casting mana to control

01:19:56.320 --> 01:20:01.360
that stormtrooper oh yeah um wait you don't you know you're not caught up I'm not caught up this

01:20:01.360 --> 01:20:05.280
season I haven't watched this season I haven't watched these two episodes no okay well I mean

01:20:05.280 --> 01:20:09.360
you wanted to venture into this conversation even I just wanted to say this is my entirely

01:20:09.360 --> 01:20:12.880
theory out there just in case because I just like I feel like there's a five percent chance I'm

01:20:12.880 --> 01:20:18.000
fucking nailing it that it's and I know he's definitely gonna be good like well he's gonna

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:23.200
be like winning whatever he's doing because it's like yeah he's like the author's insert character

01:20:23.200 --> 01:20:27.200
yeah I think he's gonna be king and then he's gonna like he's gonna sit and then he's gonna like

01:20:27.200 --> 01:20:32.080
eat put his thumb in his mouth halfway you know I think you do like um I think you put I think you

01:20:32.080 --> 01:20:38.560
make it brand and you put wheels on the on the throne whoa he's sitting down anyway big wheels

01:20:38.560 --> 01:20:45.440
made out of swords it's Danielle right yeah a Game of Thrones fan at all predictions anything get

01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:49.600
anything off your chest you haven't had a chance to talk about Game of Thrones on this show for

01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:58.000
six years so anything you want to say the Starks are just gonna rule all okay the Starks there you go

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:03.760
I don't I don't that's not my prediction but I like it all right no I can't I really think

01:21:03.760 --> 01:21:12.880
that it's spoiling so far yeah let's fight I love attacking people well what's your concern with

01:21:13.520 --> 01:21:18.960
giving us your prediction like I truly think a lot of them are right like and so it acts as well

01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:24.480
tell us like it'll be like a bedding pool we'll get like brackets and stuff like that I don't want

01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:29.440
it I don't know I mean we me and my roommate my roommate actually I'm taking my roommate's credit

01:21:29.440 --> 01:21:34.560
Callie but you know she and me worked a lot of this out and we definitely called Gendry before

01:21:34.560 --> 01:21:40.160
the season starting called what called Gendry and Ariad stuff and then that happened and it was great

01:21:40.160 --> 01:21:44.160
and also all the other predictions they're starting to get seeded in these two episodes and I was

01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:50.240
like yeah they're seeding these exact games really well tell us your prediction which one well who's

01:21:50.240 --> 01:21:55.360
on the throne at the end Tyrion okay yeah that's what I would say yeah that's what I was going to

01:21:55.360 --> 01:21:59.760
go seems a little on the nose it is on the nose it's not I mean the fat writer all that's the

01:21:59.760 --> 01:22:05.040
thing but but that's it when you look at all the sign if everything's broadcast so clearly and it's

01:22:05.040 --> 01:22:09.600
almost too obvious it's so right it will be the hands probably right that's what I said yeah okay

01:22:09.600 --> 01:22:22.720
yeah gotcha so there's one at the end John Snow knows something I miss her yeah they're

01:22:22.720 --> 01:22:29.440
married in real life apparently oh it's awesome that's like bad wow what a what a different

01:22:29.440 --> 01:22:36.240
podcast we're capable of I missed it I missed a dire wolf they had one shot in this last episode

01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:40.560
of the wolf kind of peeking his nose in the frame yeah get these motherfuckers back in action

01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:46.400
that was a cheapo that was a cheapo way of having a yeah yeah yeah that yeah that last episode was

01:22:46.400 --> 01:22:50.880
like like a clip it was just like a big reunion show everybody comes out it's like I thought the

01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:54.960
dragons looked really cheap I was that like a big thing on the internet that the I thought the

01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:59.840
first dragon flight the like the fern golly last rainforest sequence was like was I don't know it

01:22:59.840 --> 01:23:03.760
just looked really flat maybe they rushed it or something I thought it was a bit much when like

01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:09.120
they start fucking in the dragons like giving a thumbs up I think I think I made that joke last

01:23:09.120 --> 01:23:15.200
week oh yeah yeah I wasn't I didn't know if that was a joke or not I it's it's both it really

01:23:15.200 --> 01:23:21.520
happened what are we gonna be into next now the Game of Thrones is ending and no disrespect but

01:23:21.520 --> 01:23:28.720
at some point Marvel has to collapse like like as a genre though are we are we gonna get into

01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:33.600
film noir are we gonna get are we gonna just go into a 10-year period of stories about

01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:39.120
alcoholics that solve mysteries and shouldn't like be problematic with the girl that comes in

01:23:39.120 --> 01:23:43.200
the door because we're just like anything super and I'm out I think the future is definitely

01:23:43.200 --> 01:23:48.080
multi-character mockumentary shows on streaming services you know like if they're you know taking

01:23:48.080 --> 01:23:52.400

01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:26.640
year old nephew who just got an iPhone for his birthday and uh and his his parents check the iPhone

01:27:26.640 --> 01:27:32.080
I think I think they check it every night I think it's the rule or something so it's like and it's

01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:36.880
divorced parents and there's like I don't want to add that that I think is too private because like

01:27:36.880 --> 01:27:43.360
uh yeah I don't want to question like motivations of who got who's I what am I doing it's good

01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:50.320
he's got an 11 year old nephew that got an iPhone and if that sounds weird to you uh or normal to

01:27:50.320 --> 01:27:54.960
you as anyone's guess because we don't have rules for these days like we don't we don't have any

01:27:54.960 --> 01:28:00.480
fucking old standards and so 11 year old kids got an iPhone and then uh the Rick and Morty writer

01:28:00.480 --> 01:28:04.880
who's his uncle is getting all these texts from the 11 year old kid he just got his first phone

01:28:04.880 --> 01:28:11.760
like I mean I was an idiot on Friendster when I was 25 because I was like what other people named

01:28:11.760 --> 01:28:20.880
Dan we should form a club um the like like to be 11 and all of a sudden be able to do what

01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:25.760
fucking big people do which is stare at the fucking thing and like I don't I guess I don't have to

01:28:25.760 --> 01:28:31.200
make a case that the kid deserves a break it's a kid but it's just like just because I remember

01:28:31.200 --> 01:28:35.760
being his uncle and his uncle's like and then at like 6 a.m. I'm yeah I get I get this text it's

01:28:35.760 --> 01:28:44.240
like sup whoa so funny like I was like and he like he wrote this response about about boundaries

01:28:44.240 --> 01:28:50.480
and stuff ultimately like and I was like why wasn't Matt returning his text an option and he and he

01:28:50.480 --> 01:28:56.160
was he was like like well I mean along and short of it was like he's like well I don't want to

01:28:56.160 --> 01:29:02.480
turn dishonest because now there's technology that makes it possible to connect with each other

01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:10.400
I have it it I just can't have like I don't want the technology to turn me into a liar it's kind

01:29:10.400 --> 01:29:16.720
of what it's like saying like like maybe I'm not always stoked to have my nephew like ask me a

01:29:16.720 --> 01:29:26.400
question at 730 or whatever it's so you guys how will you raise your children in this new era of

01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:34.080
nano trons and micro whams I do feel like it fucks with your brain like I don't think I would

01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:38.640
actually stop my kid from using a smartphone or like put an age limit on it but I would be pretty

01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:44.160
uncomfortable with the idea of like having that like that attention kind of thing I feel very

01:29:44.160 --> 01:29:49.200
addicted to my phone and I don't like it like do you think that kids here's just a it's just a

01:29:49.200 --> 01:29:54.000
specifying on the question if you will like like do you think that kids what if you're raising a kid

01:29:54.640 --> 01:30:02.320
who like kid age and it's like it's sort of like like our parents my parents uh uh uh there is like

01:30:02.320 --> 01:30:07.680
oh let's go to the malt shop uh because and you're and they're like where are you going you're going

01:30:07.680 --> 01:30:15.200
to the malt shop all of that fucking that idea of control over your the development of your children

01:30:15.200 --> 01:30:19.680
like how much freedom and how much power they have and you're hearing these story either these

01:30:19.680 --> 01:30:25.360
like urban legends but actual stories of like she talked her friend into suicide because they

01:30:25.360 --> 01:30:31.040
were talking every day in the text like where are we at with like this idea of like your kid like

01:30:31.040 --> 01:30:36.880
like as a guy who has no kids and it was terrified of the idea like what's an addiction to him so

01:30:36.880 --> 01:30:42.000
one of the first things I ever did was a movie about suicide and uh and I spent a bunch of time in

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:47.360
the uh suicide prevention community and talking about like the young brain and it's like this

01:30:47.360 --> 01:30:52.240
addiction to immediate gratification right it's like uh and and that's why the suicide rates

01:30:52.240 --> 01:30:58.800
are going up amongst younger people because there's this this addiction to like you know if I want

01:30:58.800 --> 01:31:03.200
to solve a problem I can solve it like right now if I want to contact somebody or tell somebody

01:31:03.200 --> 01:31:06.640
something or buy something like I'm getting right now but if I like get kicked out of my house for

01:31:06.640 --> 01:31:11.120
being gay or I fight with my break up with my boyfriend or girlfriend or whatever you know you

01:31:11.120 --> 01:31:16.000
want that immediate gratification and I think that's like that Pavlovian dog response that we've gotten

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:22.160
of like you know of of being able to wake up be or whatever yeah just immediately plus we're getting

01:31:22.160 --> 01:31:26.400
inundated with so much imagery like the average one of the statistics always blows my mind is the

01:31:26.400 --> 01:31:31.440
average agency hardcore pornography these days is seven seven years old like that's when it was

01:31:31.440 --> 01:31:36.640
nine like of like 10 years ago the average age of look how could we let that Venice sink the average

01:31:36.640 --> 01:31:46.320
the average age of we were once a proud lot two thousand years old the golden era I'm confused

01:31:46.320 --> 01:31:51.120
gay but the average age of doing what the average age of seeing your first hardcore porn for the first

01:31:51.120 --> 01:31:55.680
time is like is seven oh the first I got so it was like you add that with the gratification with

01:31:55.680 --> 01:32:00.000
the immediate gratification thing with with with all that combined it yeah I think it like yeah I

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:05.680
don't want kids yeah well I mean yeah I mean we all yeah we all like look at the fact that like oh

01:32:05.680 --> 01:32:10.880
it's a it's a crazy jungle and I'm just like what I'm curious about is like what you talk to any

01:32:10.880 --> 01:32:16.480
parent and it's always a different adventure like they have to make their own rules on a level that

01:32:16.480 --> 01:32:21.120
I don't think any previous generation of parent has ever I mean well probably your kids probably

01:32:21.120 --> 01:32:25.200
fucking pioneer times when you have like a saber-tooth tiger and you have to like it's that you can't

01:32:25.200 --> 01:32:29.200
you can't just go oh I'll do whatever your family does no you get a fucking unique situation there's

01:32:29.200 --> 01:32:34.080
piranha there and there's a dinosaur there I don't know anything about history or yeah I've been

01:32:34.080 --> 01:32:39.760
thinking about this a lot lately I got really scared of technology and everything but I realized

01:32:39.760 --> 01:32:46.640
that I was really I think I was really addicted to I went on tumblr every single day and I quit

01:32:46.640 --> 01:32:52.080
going on tumblr I didn't delete my account or anything because like I'll go back but it's been

01:32:52.080 --> 01:32:59.680
like three or four days since I went on it at all and I quit because I realized it was I wasn't

01:32:59.680 --> 01:33:03.920
having any like I spent a lot of alone time and I spent a lot of time in my head and I realized

01:33:03.920 --> 01:33:08.720
that instead of going to my own brain for things I was going to tumblr for things like instead of

01:33:08.720 --> 01:33:14.560
going for to my own self for thinking of funny things or whatever or like a comment on something

01:33:14.560 --> 01:33:19.280
I'd be like what do people on tumblr say or do about this thing or something yeah like if I got

01:33:19.280 --> 01:33:23.120
into a tv show instead of just having all these thoughts myself I'd like search the tag on tumblr

01:33:23.120 --> 01:33:29.360
what did everyone else say I mean that's that's so much less shameful than the I think I like I

01:33:29.360 --> 01:33:35.520
recognize that about Twitter I'm like and kept right on chugging like I didn't even like notice

01:33:35.520 --> 01:33:40.160
that and been like oh that's bad I was like I think in tweets now yeah I was like that's all

01:33:41.440 --> 01:33:45.920
it was really well it was really affecting me because also people I think in general but

01:33:45.920 --> 01:33:52.240
especially online and then especially on tumblr people talk very negatively and I really internalized

01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:57.280
that and stuff like I got a job and then I got really sad about it because everyone talks about

01:33:57.280 --> 01:34:02.160
like oh I have to go to work and stuff I have to get up in the morning I'm so sad but I was like

01:34:02.160 --> 01:34:06.720
I'm really happy about my job but I have like I feel like I have like other people's thoughts in my

01:34:06.720 --> 01:34:11.760
head like oh the daily grind I have what they say about work in my head it could be siblings of years

01:34:11.760 --> 01:34:16.880
without even signing up for the job I think that you know each individual of them of course you

01:34:16.880 --> 01:34:22.400
would probably predict along with me they would be like no I'm so stoked for you and all this stuff

01:34:22.400 --> 01:34:29.120
it would be like an outpouring of love but it was like that yeah the idea of it's like we yeah it's

01:34:29.120 --> 01:34:34.080
interesting well yeah I got real friends like in real life and then they're very positive about

01:34:34.080 --> 01:34:40.720
everything you know and stuff I haven't had friends in a while but there are there are ways to you

01:34:40.720 --> 01:34:46.880
get I mean we should be proud of the fact that as like primates we are super geared towards like

01:34:46.880 --> 01:34:55.200
picking up on what I would do in this particular context to achieve praise to feel valuable to

01:34:55.200 --> 01:35:00.880
like like any all these things that we like to regard as like oh here's the empirical human

01:35:00.880 --> 01:35:07.040
experiences as if there's anything empirical about a fucking monkey that that thinks it's half god and

01:35:07.040 --> 01:35:14.320
like like can't like like spinning from sentience and like running across the earth going maybe if

01:35:14.320 --> 01:35:20.240
I had an alphabet like it's psychosis so like there's nothing empirical about what we go through

01:35:20.800 --> 01:35:28.400
like except for the fact that we are that moving planchette on the Ouija board of god's abuse

01:35:28.400 --> 01:35:34.400
all right I went a little too far too true you can't use abuse as a metaphor for a Ouija board

01:35:34.400 --> 01:35:39.920
that's dumb and also why start with the technical french term for the pointer thing on a Ouija

01:35:39.920 --> 01:35:47.520
board what are you a guy who watched 1987's witch board this is exactly what you said in my dream

01:35:47.520 --> 01:35:55.520
Dan this is amazing there's a word word Gabe I'm doing a show how everyone's doing a show and you

01:35:55.520 --> 01:36:02.800
come on here and you think you can be that and do this and that nothing will happen everything's

01:36:02.800 --> 01:36:10.080
going to happen and everything is nothing and the difference is a poor man's jewish harp

01:36:11.840 --> 01:36:17.840
playing in the darkness in a jug band on a he-ha that's been cancelled because you're out of the

01:36:17.840 --> 01:36:24.960
demo I'm out of the demo I'm in the demo man I'm the main demo well you will you will you can

01:36:24.960 --> 01:36:33.600
find me because I'm high this is where I get uncarismatically high but when you're getting more high

01:36:33.600 --> 01:36:37.360
as the time passes did you hold this baseball did you panic a little bit when you were like you're

01:36:37.360 --> 01:36:43.360
like telling the story about how you like literally you were like at jail and you were like come on

01:36:43.360 --> 01:36:46.320
like someone's going to talk to me about this and I like made the joke of like that's

01:36:46.320 --> 01:36:51.360
fucking privilege and then like right after that you were you the word queer came you're like

01:36:51.360 --> 01:36:58.480
also I'm fucking gay by the way like like did you like play at the time when the when that when

01:36:58.480 --> 01:37:03.760
that when that event ice cream I'm gay well no but you when you did you did your impression of it

01:37:03.760 --> 01:37:07.840
where you are like you're like I don't know what to do and like and you also said the word queer

01:37:07.840 --> 01:37:13.440
and I'm curious like were you were you projecting the image for that person of like I can't I can't

01:37:13.440 --> 01:37:19.520
spend fucking Martin Luther King weekend in prison like in jail like like and and like translated

01:37:19.520 --> 01:37:24.720
into kind of like um sexuality terms a little bit even more so than

01:37:28.560 --> 01:37:34.960
no he's shaking his head no I mean I channel everything into sexual terms but I don't know if

01:37:34.960 --> 01:37:41.520
I don't know I don't know this is this is I don't know what you're asking oh like he's talking about

01:37:41.520 --> 01:37:49.840
the moment when when what was the climax of it when when when telling the the story and then he

01:37:49.840 --> 01:37:53.840
said the word privilege where you panicked into wanting to seem like more of just a straight

01:37:53.840 --> 01:38:00.640
white young man who got out of jail for free like oh did I want a less like oh I'm also gay like I'm

01:38:00.640 --> 01:38:05.520
also gay oh yeah yeah you're asking why if that's the reason why I said that well I guess that was

01:38:05.520 --> 01:38:09.760
a layer of it but then I was also curious in the meantime because I was like well that's a that's

01:38:09.760 --> 01:38:14.320
you don't you also don't have to we don't have to talk about that but also going back to that part

01:38:14.320 --> 01:38:20.160
of the story I was also curious if that wait are you asking if what you really wanted to do was call

01:38:20.160 --> 01:38:24.720
me a faggot just now when you were when you were putting me in my place and well that's not cool

01:38:24.720 --> 01:38:32.240
Dan oh damn is that too far bro whoa you're you're out of the demo new world yeah like where you're

01:38:32.240 --> 01:38:37.760
gonna like kind of show man oh no no that no that was not connected no all right all right

01:38:37.760 --> 01:38:42.240
because that because that might that might I was thinking about age I was like because I was

01:38:42.240 --> 01:38:48.160
projecting myself as when I think demo I was like you're too old but you're not too old I was

01:38:48.160 --> 01:38:54.960
that's what that was I was not connecting I did I did leap from you're out of the demo hey can I

01:38:54.960 --> 01:39:01.680
ask gay questions that is that is the core that I follow that's by the way that the main center

01:39:01.680 --> 01:39:07.040
of conversation at Starburns industries most of the time is like we'll start off in one

01:39:07.040 --> 01:39:11.920
bit of conversation and then we'll get it because I'm I identify as queer some by section I'm into

01:39:11.920 --> 01:39:18.080
both and and it will always no matter what the it's like the dowling thing or whatever looking

01:39:18.080 --> 01:39:23.200
for water it's like there will be like a conversation about like is nerf still putting out products

01:39:23.200 --> 01:39:27.840
and then it'll be like well that's interesting because you know with dicks and vaginas you know

01:39:27.840 --> 01:39:34.320
like it always will lead back to that path same yeah yeah so in your very Harmon way I it was

01:39:34.320 --> 01:39:38.400
perfect because I didn't understand anything you were really saying it was completely over my head

01:39:38.400 --> 01:39:46.480
but then it got back to dicks so you want to talk about dicks I don't I we started with balls

01:39:48.240 --> 01:39:54.480
I wait wait you once said you once said in a bar that you find a bisexuality to be the most

01:39:54.480 --> 01:40:03.360
highly evolved of the species and I can't tell you how dare you how don't tell my millennial audience

01:40:04.400 --> 01:40:10.720
it was a brief lapse of of closed-mindedness someone said that to me about like non-binary

01:40:10.720 --> 01:40:17.040
people like well that's like I don't say it to everyone I think some people aren't to the next

01:40:17.040 --> 01:40:26.320
stage of evolution but loss prevention I think is that's very important I yeah you ever fired someone

01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:33.200
shrinkage shrink I just oh sorry what if she's like yeah I'm a huge homophobe I don't hit a lot

01:40:33.200 --> 01:40:38.880
so my whole life I grew up with all boys I have three brothers and a dad and I always thought guys

01:40:38.880 --> 01:40:44.320
tucked their penis up when they put their pants on yeah where does it go some do

01:40:44.320 --> 01:40:51.520
you because you're like here's how a person because it's so big I don't know I just always thought

01:40:51.520 --> 01:40:56.000
that guys just took their penis up when they put their you see tuck it up tuck it up where

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:59.840
like into your waist band so just so it's not to the left or right so I could just go in the

01:40:59.840 --> 01:41:04.400
middle for some reason that you would like sit on it or close your legs on it so you always

01:41:04.400 --> 01:41:09.280
tucked it up some people do right was this was this based on you seeing one of your brothers do

01:41:09.280 --> 01:41:16.480
this or something and it is the conversation like did you steal that DVD of demolition man also

01:41:17.280 --> 01:41:22.240
you know do you like your penis yeah yeah does that have something you would not tuck that's

01:41:22.240 --> 01:41:27.600
actually the first question I have your penis in my interviews with guys I'm like how where you put

01:41:27.600 --> 01:41:32.240
your penis I have to go to the left or right right I don't think that's not a symmetry

01:41:32.240 --> 01:41:38.960
all I had was Game of Thrones I think that's you could say faggot if you want to Dan you can

01:41:38.960 --> 01:41:45.600
lean right where does it go where does it go I need to know if the two different ways you know

01:41:45.600 --> 01:41:49.600
it's not like you're gonna be like faggot you're gonna be like faggot you know you say like you

01:41:49.600 --> 01:41:53.440
lean into the into the sassy side of it you can get away with them you have two queer people

01:41:53.440 --> 01:41:59.600
giving you permission to say the word yeah all the way that word should be a flathead screwdriver

01:41:59.600 --> 01:42:05.120
like that was like that that really went bring it back maybe not some people are yeah where's Dino

01:42:05.120 --> 01:42:10.640
Stamatopoulos let's give him or he's in Europe I was thinking the other day about how on Twitter

01:42:10.640 --> 01:42:16.160
of like like which is while a showrunner of community technically but it wasn't like it's

01:42:16.160 --> 01:42:20.560
it's like the internet was different it was a fucking showrunner of an NBC sitcom but it's

01:42:20.560 --> 01:42:26.480
still this was it was like I've told this story before where my brother tweeted that he was like

01:42:26.480 --> 01:42:31.040
proud of his daughter or something like that and I tweet I responded I was just like fag

01:42:31.920 --> 01:42:38.880
and it was like I'm not I'm not I am not fucking telling you that at the time that was funny it's

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:47.200
there was you know point in explaining that it was like for for me as an individual

01:42:48.560 --> 01:42:54.800
evident by that behavior I was in a space where I thought that was absolutely fine

01:42:54.800 --> 01:42:59.920
and and and like I remember getting kind of like like a bunch of people going like did you

01:42:59.920 --> 01:43:06.800
just call that man a fag for loving his daughter and being kind of like yeah well it wasn't even

01:43:06.800 --> 01:43:13.200
about outrage or oppressing anyone's like when you put it that way even if we were on a desert

01:43:13.200 --> 01:43:20.320
island I'm a bad brother that was a dumb why did I think that's funny and but not to mention the

01:43:20.320 --> 01:43:25.280
fact that then people are like it was like but I was just the reason I bring up the stories

01:43:25.280 --> 01:43:30.240
because I remember I was like I'm like doing something around my house and kind of daydreaming

01:43:30.240 --> 01:43:36.880
about the internet and how it was different uh 10 years ago which is such a weird thing because

01:43:36.880 --> 01:43:42.000
the internet's supposed to be the thing that's different about any years ago and now and then

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:48.560
thinking back as an old man and going I remember when I didn't get fired for calling my brother a

01:43:48.560 --> 01:43:57.600
fag for loving his daughter in front of everyone then a couple people yelled at me and I said

01:43:57.600 --> 01:44:05.120
listen I didn't mean to call my brother a fag and the fags talked it out with me and they

01:44:06.080 --> 01:44:11.040
told me about a charity and I donated to it and that's why I'm woke

01:44:11.040 --> 01:44:21.040

01:53:09.040 --> 01:53:15.520
do you have it does anything stick out to you about your exposure to hardcore pornography

01:53:16.160 --> 01:53:21.440
it's a tasteful podcast god damn it i'll tell the story about the first time i ever saw porn

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:26.960
uh it was what year did the movie mordecai come out with johnny depp oh that movie's

01:53:26.960 --> 01:53:34.880
recently it was uh what was it like 2015 or 2014 or something and um i really liked that movie

01:53:34.880 --> 01:53:40.000
and i liked the guy in it and i looked up on google not looking for porn whatsoever just google

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:51.600
images just friendly safe photos i looked up blonde men with mustaches that's in my favorites

01:53:53.280 --> 01:53:59.520
because i was like more please and it took you to the weather man's union and i saw a porn video

01:53:59.520 --> 01:54:05.440
and i was like all right i guess today's the day i gotta gotta see porn for the first time sometime

01:54:05.440 --> 01:54:13.200
wait how old were you seven is that what you said i was probably 15 or 16 whatever year the

01:54:13.200 --> 01:54:19.280
movie mordecai came out so i think like 16 probably i'm gonna stop asking questions because it's like

01:54:19.280 --> 01:54:24.400
it's uncharismatic now what was your i was i told his story you weren't even asking well i remember

01:54:24.400 --> 01:54:28.640
no no but i was curious about that because i was thinking about mine which i can volunteer and which

01:54:28.640 --> 01:54:33.520
won't feel yeah what's your first penetrative old dude that can just tell you like penetrative porn

01:54:33.520 --> 01:54:39.520
not like like like like looking at like actual yeah i remember i've i've mentioned this on the

01:54:39.520 --> 01:54:46.960
podcast before like that it was uh my dad had a box in his basement and that was playboy he had a

01:54:46.960 --> 01:54:51.920
subscription to playboy for a year of his life and there was no hard drive there was no we didn't

01:54:51.920 --> 01:54:57.200
know that porn was infinite so like i i i even if you got married you would just put your all your

01:54:57.200 --> 01:55:02.880
playboys in a box and i guess and put it there there was just somehow over the years we knew

01:55:03.520 --> 01:55:08.320
you know take 20 years you get you get like me and my brother like somehow we'd figured out like

01:55:08.320 --> 01:55:14.240
there's like 17 magazines up on a top shelf in the basement somewhere that represent my dad's

01:55:15.040 --> 01:55:23.760
you know carnal final final years as a subscriber to being a single guy in the form of something

01:55:23.760 --> 01:55:31.760
that you couldn't there was no internet to look at you couldn't type in boobs um but the more but

01:55:31.760 --> 01:55:39.120
the hardcore thing was like we would we would we would hunt for crawdad crayfish we called them

01:55:39.120 --> 01:55:45.200
in milwaukee yeah like crayfish they were like in this pond where we told this we would go we

01:55:45.200 --> 01:55:52.640
would ride our dirt bikes up there and so it was like i want to say 10 9 or 10 and uh yeah it was

01:55:52.640 --> 01:55:58.160
like there was like this creek and uh pond and then on the other side of these railroad tracks

01:55:58.160 --> 01:56:03.680
there was this printing company and one of their clients was hustler and there was just this kind

01:56:03.680 --> 01:56:12.240
of general uh it's like i don't know how i don't know by what system but it was sort of like in

01:56:12.240 --> 01:56:18.240
this weird place where you hunted for crayfish part of the magic of that area was that if you

01:56:18.240 --> 01:56:24.960
you if you if you root it around enough you are going to eventually find like weird loose muddy pages

01:56:25.680 --> 01:56:34.480
of of cast off like misprinted pornography from the only periodical that i'm sure out of all that

01:56:34.480 --> 01:56:38.240
that printing plant probably wasn't just it didn't say hustler on the top of the printing plant it was

01:56:38.240 --> 01:56:45.040
probably just this chugga chugga we turn acid into paper or the vice versa kind of like plant but

01:56:45.040 --> 01:56:52.000
like the only thing that they accomplished that made it into grubby hands that probably left

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:59.520
and then turned into things that were amenable to the wind uh like we're that that we didn't

01:56:59.520 --> 01:57:05.360
learn anything about cooking uh from there was it was just like you would just you'd be a fucking

01:57:05.360 --> 01:57:10.800
muddy you're like rock and you'd lift it you're like i think i see something pull it out and it'd be

01:57:10.800 --> 01:57:19.520
this weird like pictorial about a truck driver stopping in the diner but will you will you show

01:57:19.520 --> 01:57:24.160
me what today's specials are and like i mean like we would all huddle around it experience that's a

01:57:24.160 --> 01:57:31.280
nice like hands-on like i i i i spent some time growing up in the midwest and uh uh like tornado

01:57:31.280 --> 01:57:37.360
season came through and ripped down um the janitors like a little shack that he had he'd like you know

01:57:37.360 --> 01:57:41.280
the little shack and the next day i mean the whole thing didn't go down but it was like partially

01:57:41.280 --> 01:57:47.200
you know messed up and the next day there was porn magazines all like around campus that happened

01:57:47.200 --> 01:57:53.520
to me too like hanging in a tree was the jenny mccarthy playboy one of her in the in the in the

01:57:53.520 --> 01:57:58.960
in the bathtub and i remember like a friend you know a couple friends like reaching up at it you

01:57:58.960 --> 01:58:05.200
know like like you're reaching for it and uh and they never got polio right that sounds more rustic

01:58:05.200 --> 01:58:10.720
than a mr. plains you can parse that information however you want my my my first heavy porn was a

01:58:10.720 --> 01:58:15.120
magazine open mind mine was when we were on tour with the king and i i was at this point 10 years

01:58:15.120 --> 01:58:20.960
old and we were hotels every three weeks like across the country and we were like st louis

01:58:20.960 --> 01:58:27.760
or since an ad here somewhere and we like i i i found something under the bed or maybe one of

01:58:27.760 --> 01:58:32.080
the other kids in the in the show found something under their hotel room bed and it was a porn mag

01:58:32.080 --> 01:58:37.520
of pretty hardcore stuff and it was all black people it was like an ebony kind of you know

01:58:37.520 --> 01:58:45.200
thing and it was really wild and i'd never seen yes queen i don't know i just look i try to stay

01:58:45.200 --> 01:58:49.440
relevant all right now we just sat there we just sat there in the bed and just went through it and

01:58:49.440 --> 01:58:55.440
i'm like what what like what is that what is that what is that and like what's that white stuff and

01:58:55.440 --> 01:59:00.320
what the what the fuck is going on we we were like detectives trying to like reverse it like

01:59:00.320 --> 01:59:04.400
do they like each other are they fighting what's going on is that pee or is that and if it was a

01:59:04.400 --> 01:59:09.360
hustler the answer was i don't know that's the problem i think that that's not the did you

01:59:09.360 --> 01:59:14.960
did you guys all find the porn before you ever had the talk or after uh i can't remember the

01:59:14.960 --> 01:59:20.000
talk i've told the story before on my podcast but i think my mom at a pretty early age and i think

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:25.280
with the best of intentions like did say this lying to me that i never forgot which was like

01:59:25.280 --> 01:59:31.600
do you know how babies get made and i was like i don't know like i really don't remember how old

01:59:31.600 --> 01:59:36.480
i was when i remember my mom going like i mean mom would be like this isn't fair this retelling of

01:59:36.480 --> 01:59:41.920
the fucking story and i now i sympathize with her now that my comedy sketch from 2009 like like

01:59:41.920 --> 01:59:47.920
make i'm starting to realize what i've put my parents through as an adult um and the retelling

01:59:47.920 --> 01:59:52.480
of their fucking foibles when they were children having children but like i remember my mom saying

01:59:52.480 --> 01:59:59.680
like the man's the man sees a naked lady and his and his penis stands up and starts to dance around

01:59:59.680 --> 02:00:08.240
and it shoots white stuff out of it dances around there's no contact in that story it's like a man

02:00:08.240 --> 02:00:15.200
like sees a fucking woman and like his penis was his dad doing right i remember that was that was

02:00:15.200 --> 02:00:19.840
the birds and bees talk that i got but and i but i do think i learned about sex from porn i mean i

02:00:19.840 --> 02:00:25.520
could see that the grown-ups in the porn movies that we could see my dad had vhs tapes and we were

02:00:25.520 --> 02:00:30.720
seeing these hustler magazines we could see that one thing that correlates to the thing that we know

02:00:30.720 --> 02:00:35.440
that makes boys that's like going in there like we could see it going in there but it's still

02:00:35.440 --> 02:00:41.360
countless debates about is that pee is that where she pees like what's that stuff what's that stuff

02:00:41.360 --> 02:00:45.760
you are actively looking for it that's the other thing is like only kid needs to google like the

02:00:45.760 --> 02:00:53.040
word boy or girl or man woman whatever and like that stuff just appears like i find it yeah i mean

02:00:53.040 --> 02:00:57.760
i think that's a whole other like mindset which is like i was i was right on the cusp i'm right at

02:00:57.760 --> 02:01:03.360
the the age where i was still like looking at national geographics for boobies and such

02:01:03.360 --> 02:01:09.120
and hoping for a wee wee but they never had the wee wees um but like i was like i think literally

02:01:09.120 --> 02:01:14.560
like the last generation who had right before it like crossed over and i would like actively like

02:01:14.560 --> 02:01:20.160
look for it but if it just like it's thrown in your face well that's the whole thing right aren't

02:01:20.160 --> 02:01:24.080
we like having sex less now that's like a thing right well i think it's but i think that's god

02:01:24.080 --> 02:01:28.160
i've read those headlines or i'm like millennials are having sex less and i'm like i know why and

02:01:28.160 --> 02:01:34.160
it ain't got nothing like like oh my god like what a fucking contract like for the rest of your life

02:01:34.160 --> 02:01:39.120
well there's a um there's a lot of people saying which makes sense that um porn is so crazy and

02:01:39.120 --> 02:01:44.400
there's all this stuff and then you could have it like anytime any place and so um you could see it

02:01:44.400 --> 02:01:48.160
and so then and they do you could watch like more and more hardcore stuff that maybe you'd

02:01:48.160 --> 02:01:52.560
never get the opportunity to do in real life so you get like you know overstimulated by that so

02:01:52.560 --> 02:01:56.480
then real sex is like boring to people there's supposedly that's the problem i'm having yeah

02:01:56.480 --> 02:02:03.440
yeah totally i i i do i do want to say that i want to offer i want to offer a counterpoint

02:02:03.440 --> 02:02:10.000
to that just because i remember being a very sexually like non-functional person and and

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:15.840
reading that stuff and like really letting it add to my shame that what i was reading was the

02:02:15.840 --> 02:02:19.680
like it was like the self-fulfilling prophecy of like well what do you expect all you do is jerk

02:02:19.680 --> 02:02:24.640
off all over the internet of course now you're becoming golem because you because you like

02:02:24.640 --> 02:02:28.960
what are you gonna do except hang out and like polish your ring in a fucking cave even though

02:02:28.960 --> 02:02:34.240
that's the one place you don't need to be visible you eat fish all day like like you're it's like

02:02:34.240 --> 02:02:40.160
who cares who sees you but like i have a million questions about lord of the rings but but uh but

02:02:40.160 --> 02:02:44.880
i do i do want to counter that just a little bit because remembering the amount of shame that

02:02:44.880 --> 02:02:51.360
that made me feel and the amount of true that that wasn't necessarily i do absolutely think that

02:02:51.360 --> 02:02:57.840
people online that are like you know i'm i'm i'm touching myself so much that like i it's a it's

02:02:57.840 --> 02:03:04.320
a dysfunction and of course that's why i'm not this or that like like it just it makes me want to

02:03:04.320 --> 02:03:10.400
burst into tears thinking about that and i just want to say that like being yeah being with someone

02:03:10.400 --> 02:03:18.080
that you can trust like feeling that you have permission to be who you are it erases everything

02:03:18.080 --> 02:03:25.520
it's not it's just it's it's it's done and done you're not damaging yourself by indulging yourself

02:03:25.520 --> 02:03:30.880
you're not you're you're you're you're not a fucking like phone battery that you can run out

02:03:30.880 --> 02:03:35.600
you're not you're not you're not a you're not a product you're if you're if you're if you're

02:03:35.600 --> 02:03:40.960

02:03:40.960 --> 02:03:48.080
and um uh your your libido will be healthy soon um uh whenever it whenever it needs to be it'll it'll
