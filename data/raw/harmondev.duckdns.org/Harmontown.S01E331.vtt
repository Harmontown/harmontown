{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:08.240\nWelcome, one and all, to Dynasty Typewriter in downtown Los Angeles, where they're about\n\n00:08.240 --> 00:11.440\nHarmontown, as once again in session.\n\n00:11.440 --> 00:22.560\nLet's bring out the game master, Mr. Spencer Crittenden.\n\n00:22.560 --> 00:37.680\nOh yeah, Spencer's hittin' down on his desk couch, it's a cabinet, it's got drawers on\n\n00:37.680 --> 00:38.680\nit.\n\n00:38.680 --> 00:40.680\nI'm talkin', I'm talkin', you got a hold on, like, hold on couch.\n\n00:40.680 --> 00:43.680\nOh, it's more like a love seat.\n\n00:43.680 --> 00:45.680\nIt's like a fainting couch.\n\n00:45.680 --> 00:50.120\nSpeaking of love, let's welcome the sexiest seat in town, the mayor of Harmontown, Mr.\n\n00:50.120 --> 00:51.120\nDan Harmon.\n\n00:51.120 --> 01:13.200\nOh, Tim, Tim, Tim, thank you, thank you, thank you, thanks.\n\n01:13.200 --> 01:20.040\nI have to pick and choose, I had a couple things to talk about, but I gotta go in order\n\n01:20.040 --> 01:28.880\nof importance, or I'll forget the most important thing, which is, I looked into why balls hang\n\n01:28.880 --> 01:37.040\noff the body today, and for years, because I've always known that explanation that you've\n\n01:37.040 --> 01:43.560\nheard, which is like, oh, it takes a degree cooler temperature for sperm to be either\n\n01:43.560 --> 01:49.400\nmade or stored, and it's like, what?\n\n01:49.400 --> 01:53.000\nYou're telling me they didn't figure out a way, it's just, something rang false about\n\n01:53.000 --> 01:54.000\nit.\n\n01:54.000 --> 01:58.000\nAnd I always, it was the most scientific explanation, it was like, oh, there needs to be cooler\n\n01:58.000 --> 01:59.000\ndown there.\n\n01:59.000 --> 02:06.280\nAnd I found, the thing that makes the most sense about what I learned is that part of\n\n02:06.280 --> 02:12.280\nthe lie is that that's true, the balls are hangin' down there for a temperature difference.\n\n02:12.280 --> 02:20.640\nBut the darker, more sinister thing is that it's not necessary, it's not like, oh, it's\n\n02:20.640 --> 02:26.400\na deal breaker for the evolution of life, God, there's no other way to make sperm, it\n\n02:26.400 --> 02:33.440\ncould never happen, and forget about storing them, and oh, boy, sperm, they're so delicate,\n\n02:33.440 --> 02:38.880\nthey're so, it's such an amazing process, and it needs to be this certain temperature.\n\n02:38.880 --> 02:47.880\nYou know, the sperm prefer it, they live longer and use less resources, so it's like a group\n\n02:47.880 --> 02:53.920\non, you're, it makes such, I was so, I was like, that's it, the sperm are, they're running\n\n02:53.920 --> 02:54.920\nthe show.\n\n02:54.920 --> 02:59.600\nThey got like a lever, they're pullin', they're like, let's take out up a notch, get these\n\n02:59.600 --> 03:00.600\nballs down here.\n\n03:00.600 --> 03:04.920\nThere's that one sperm that comes into the ball and goes, it's hot in here, can I go\n\n03:04.920 --> 03:08.840\ncheck it, can I go to the AC and make a little cooler in here?\n\n03:08.840 --> 03:14.120\nThat is what they're doing, because when sperm are, they're such simple organisms, like little\n\n03:14.120 --> 03:19.600\nants, I don't know if it's gross to think about ants in your balls, but like, what they\n\n03:19.600 --> 03:27.480\nshare is that there's no circulatory system, there's nothing, look, sperm have a longer,\n\n03:27.480 --> 03:33.600\nmore comfortable life in your balls than they would in a cup of soup, like, and it's because,\n\n03:33.600 --> 03:40.520\nlike, they get heat activated, like, they know when they are and aren't in a vagina,\n\n03:40.520 --> 03:45.720\nbut if they feel like they're kind of in a vagina, they'll, well, then they'll just\n\n03:45.720 --> 03:50.360\nbe all hustle, bustle, and they'll run out of their little lunches that their daddy packed\n\n03:50.360 --> 03:59.400\nfor them, and the sperm can't have that, they want to live all day, it's like, they're just\n\n03:59.400 --> 04:02.840\nlike, yes, that's what we are, we're so, we are a sperm.\n\n04:02.840 --> 04:08.800\nThey live in a constant body temperature, like 98.6 or whatever, and then they get into\n\n04:08.800 --> 04:11.880\na vagina, they're just going to be like, they're still in the jacuzzi, like, they're still\n\n04:11.880 --> 04:14.880\ngoing to be relaxed and chilling out, but what's the question?\n\n04:14.880 --> 04:21.120\nWhen they get into a vagina, and this is why, whenever you've wondered, you can understand\n\n04:21.120 --> 04:27.280\nwhy a science class would avoid this semantically, because we're just, we're already uncomfortable,\n\n04:27.280 --> 04:32.080\nwe're talking about, well, it knows when it's in a pussy, and it's kind of weird to talk\n\n04:32.080 --> 04:38.520\nabout even in a health class or something, because it's like, it's too much, sex ed,\n\n04:38.520 --> 04:42.960\nthey try to keep it, they try to keep everything separate, they're explaining all these things\n\n04:42.960 --> 04:48.920\nto you about what might happen and definitely shouldn't happen, but why your body's going\n\n04:48.920 --> 04:52.800\nthrough changes, do you have sex ed in school?\n\n04:52.800 --> 04:58.320\nBut they, even if it's a co-ed thing, they kind of like, they don't, it's like they mentioned\n\n04:58.320 --> 05:03.600\nthe act, but it's like this idea of like, well, the sperm, what you guys need to understand\n\n05:03.600 --> 05:08.800\nis that you're packing a population of 100 million torpedoes, and they want to be in\n\n05:08.800 --> 05:12.240\none place, and once they get there, it's on.\n\n05:12.240 --> 05:17.160\nThat's the part that's uncomfortable, is that when they, they get kind of heat activated,\n\n05:17.160 --> 05:21.320\nand then they're, they're like, this is it, I've been waiting my whole life, this is\n\n05:21.320 --> 05:26.720\nwhere I'm going to die, here in this desert or whatever, but they will also, the important\n\n05:26.720 --> 05:34.480\nthing to understand is that they're not, it's not like, it's not that they would burst out\n\n05:34.480 --> 05:39.240\non their own because they'd get so excited because your balls would be one degree warmer,\n\n05:39.240 --> 05:42.720\nit's just that they, it's the equivalent of them putting like cucumbers on their eyes\n\n05:42.720 --> 05:48.280\nat night, like they're just living longer, they just want to be pretty, like they just,\n\n05:48.280 --> 05:53.600\nthey want to like be, they want to be kept in a cooler room, because it makes them eat\n\n05:53.600 --> 05:54.600\nless, yeah.\n\n05:54.600 --> 05:58.680\nIt's like they're doing yoga or whatever, it's anything, it's like they're the sentience,\n\n05:58.680 --> 06:02.960\nyou know, that's the, they heard this thing on NPR about how, you know, when you're a,\n\n06:02.960 --> 06:09.000\nwhen you're developing, like your first cells are your gametes, I mean, you are, you are\n\n06:09.000 --> 06:16.160\na 3D printer that refuses to, the species is like, I'm not going to use toner on a 3D\n\n06:16.160 --> 06:21.800\nprinter that doesn't have a toner, like, like, because the whole point is making more shit,\n\n06:21.800 --> 06:27.720\nlike, I imagine, like, for all the things that can go wrong in the womb and during, like,\n\n06:27.720 --> 06:33.540\nthe gestation from blastocyst to viable fetus, you know, we, we, we, there's a whole room\n\n06:33.540 --> 06:38.480\nfull of us experiencing the glorious variations that can occur throughout that development,\n\n06:38.480 --> 06:46.400\nmany of them totally precluding an active chance at reproduction, the, the, but, and,\n\n06:46.400 --> 06:51.840\nlike, nature is, like, totally willing to lay those bets, but if you, if you were, like,\n\n06:51.840 --> 06:54.960\nin the womb and it was, like, something fucked with the whole point of it, it would, like,\n\n06:54.960 --> 06:57.280\nit probably shuts that down a thousand times more often.\n\n06:57.280 --> 06:59.720\nIt's not going to waste a penny on you.\n\n06:59.720 --> 07:05.760\nYour balls, your sperm are down in your balls, wagging the dog of your whole life.\n\n07:05.760 --> 07:10.040\nThey're just, like, like, at a nice 95 degrees.\n\n07:10.040 --> 07:11.520\nWhat a bunch of little dicks.\n\n07:11.520 --> 07:18.200\nDid I, am I making this up, but did I overhear someone say that the slight variation in temperature\n\n07:18.200 --> 07:20.800\nwill decide whether it's male or female?\n\n07:20.800 --> 07:24.000\nWell, alligators do it that way.\n\n07:24.000 --> 07:31.360\nThe alligators, their eggs, the temperature of them, look, I've been to Florida.\n\n07:31.360 --> 07:36.720\nThe alligators have that, the temperature determines gender of the, of the eggs, so I don't get\n\n07:36.720 --> 07:37.720\nthat at all.\n\n07:37.720 --> 07:43.880\nBut it kind of goes to show you, like, we might overstate the importance of, like, the\n\n07:43.880 --> 07:49.000\nintricate, I mean, that's really shotgunning, like, that is playing, like, weird fire,\n\n07:49.000 --> 07:50.000\nisn't it?\n\n07:50.000 --> 07:56.480\nLike, to, they, the alligators have their gender determination plugged into a, like, directly\n\n07:56.480 --> 08:04.840\ninto the environment, like, and they're prehistoric, they've been around forever.\n\n08:04.840 --> 08:08.760\nSo probably, like, everything is just kind of an experiment, like, there's nothing.\n\n08:08.760 --> 08:14.040\nYeah, they, they, they take their sperm cell, basically, their egg, and they put it in nature,\n\n08:14.040 --> 08:16.840\nand so nature is alligators' balls.\n\n08:16.840 --> 08:17.840\nYeah.\n\n08:17.840 --> 08:22.360\nBut alligators, alligators do have balls.\n\n08:22.360 --> 08:25.120\nI'm gonna get that tattooed.\n\n08:25.120 --> 08:28.000\nThat's how much I believe in that statement.\n\n08:28.000 --> 08:30.920\nAlligators have testes, but they're located on the inside of the alligator, which is a\n\n08:30.920 --> 08:33.720\nnatural place you'd put your testes.\n\n08:33.720 --> 08:37.160\nBut those sperm would then would have to, they would, they would live to half their\n\n08:37.160 --> 08:42.200\nage and they would feel so, imagine the futility.\n\n08:42.200 --> 08:46.600\nImagine being a sperm, I mean, they have a right, you know, to, like, live their full\n\n08:46.600 --> 08:48.760\nsperm life.\n\n08:48.760 --> 08:51.720\nHow dare we?\n\n08:51.720 --> 08:56.560\nAnd here, and there's, there's a muscle, it's not, I made, I made my employees look\n\n08:56.560 --> 08:59.720\ninto this today.\n\n08:59.720 --> 09:03.760\nWhen you have a writer's assistant, it just becomes so, it's so much better than Googling.\n\n09:03.760 --> 09:06.920\nIt gets, it, you feel like you have, like, this legitimacy, like, like, this.\n\n09:06.920 --> 09:10.880\nJohnson, I want to, I want to report on everything about balls on my desk tomorrow morning.\n\n09:10.880 --> 09:15.880\nLook at, look at balls, look at balls, how come balls are dangling, bro?\n\n09:15.880 --> 09:19.440\nWe're writing an episode about it.\n\n09:19.440 --> 09:21.200\nCan't sue me.\n\n09:21.200 --> 09:25.840\nCome on, ladies, talk about balls with your boss.\n\n09:25.840 --> 09:32.000\nI've learned nothing.\n\n09:32.000 --> 09:35.600\nThat just occurred to me.\n\n09:35.600 --> 09:40.120\nHow come balls are dangling is a great Google search string, I think.\n\n09:40.120 --> 09:44.800\nI find, you ever, you ever, you, you know, I find myself saying this a lot lately when\n\n09:44.800 --> 09:50.360\nI, I find myself consistently saying, I'll learn something and then I'll go, wow, that's\n\n09:50.360 --> 09:56.320\nsimultaneously uplifting and downtrodding, like, is that happening to you as you get\n\n09:56.320 --> 09:57.320\nolder?\n\n09:57.320 --> 10:02.720\nCause it's like you're more tasting the sublime qualities of the universe and you're kind\n\n10:02.720 --> 10:06.960\nof like, I don't, oh, that's an interesting story, but you don't get as fired up about\n\n10:06.960 --> 10:10.480\ndid the good guys win or lose?\n\n10:10.480 --> 10:13.640\nYou're just kind of like, there's another one of those stories and you kind of like\n\n10:13.640 --> 10:18.000\nstart getting off on the equilibrium of it, like, I don't know who I'm rooting for in\n\n10:18.000 --> 10:19.000\nthat story.\n\n10:19.000 --> 10:23.080\nGive me a, give me a, give me a, for instance, ah, boy, geez, I don't know us.\n\n10:23.080 --> 10:29.120\nFor instance, ah, for cry, I, I for cry, we know, we don't remember nothing on this\n\n10:29.120 --> 10:30.120\nshow.\n\n10:30.120 --> 10:31.120\nI don't know.\n\n10:31.120 --> 10:32.120\nI was just curious.\n\n10:32.120 --> 10:33.120\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n10:33.120 --> 10:34.120\nI got high.\n\n10:34.120 --> 10:35.120\nOkay.\n\n10:35.120 --> 10:39.800\nLet's, uh, but that's a good segue because our guest, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, is related\n\n10:39.800 --> 10:41.320\nto being high.\n\n10:41.320 --> 10:43.280\nWhoa.\n\n10:43.280 --> 10:47.120\nHe made a little thing called dope state, um, for with my studio, star burns.\n\n10:47.120 --> 10:48.120\nHell yeah.\n\n10:48.120 --> 10:49.120\nHe did.\n\n10:49.120 --> 10:50.280\nUm, and he's our new friend.\n\n10:50.280 --> 10:51.280\nAre you out there?\n\n10:51.280 --> 10:52.280\nAre you back there game?\n\n10:52.280 --> 10:53.280\nI guess it doesn't matter.\n\n10:53.280 --> 10:54.280\nI think he's out there.\n\n10:54.280 --> 11:03.560\nUh, please welcome your new friend Gabe Sunday to the stage anywhere you like, but I think\n\n11:03.560 --> 11:04.560\noh man.\n\n11:04.560 --> 11:05.560\nOkay.\n\n11:05.560 --> 11:07.160\nSo first question, where'd you get that outfit?\n\n11:07.160 --> 11:08.160\nI need it.\n\n11:08.160 --> 11:12.280\nUm, yeah, I wore this because this was my like comfy.\n\n11:12.280 --> 11:14.280\nThis is like my comfy editing gear.\n\n11:14.280 --> 11:15.280\nThat's great.\n\n11:15.280 --> 11:17.760\nI bought scrubs the other day and this is like an upgrade of that.\n\n11:17.760 --> 11:23.440\nFor those listening, he's, uh, he's got kind of a flight suit, like military jumper kind\n\n11:23.440 --> 11:24.440\nof thing.\n\n11:24.440 --> 11:25.440\nI got my super tight shirt on.\n\n11:25.440 --> 11:28.080\nSo Starburns, uh, Starburns are, yeah, super tight.\n\n11:28.080 --> 11:32.640\nYou look like a guy in Top Gun that like that's, it was like the Top Guns drug dealer.\n\n11:32.640 --> 11:35.520\nThat the out, that the out day one in Top Gun.\n\n11:35.520 --> 11:40.920\nThe only one that's like, you know, you had, you had clearance to get on the base, but\n\n11:40.920 --> 11:41.920\nthey make, they made you wear that.\n\n11:41.920 --> 11:43.480\nSo you look like you kind of fit in.\n\n11:43.480 --> 11:44.480\nAll right.\n\n11:44.480 --> 11:45.480\nI got too high.\n\n11:45.480 --> 11:46.480\nI got too high.\n\n11:46.480 --> 11:47.800\nThat's perfect.\n\n11:47.800 --> 11:48.800\nThat's perfect.\n\n11:48.800 --> 11:49.800\nMan.\n\n11:49.800 --> 11:50.800\nIt's great, man.\n\n11:50.800 --> 11:54.840\nDo you find yourself when you, do you ever get too high as that question first?\n\n11:54.840 --> 11:55.840\nAbsolutely.\n\n11:55.840 --> 11:56.840\nI'm, I'm very sad.\n\n11:56.840 --> 11:58.600\nI have a very precarious relationship with Meryl.\n\n11:58.600 --> 12:03.680\nI mean, like, I don't, I'm not, I can't, I do crave it because it's my, it's what,\n\n12:03.680 --> 12:05.440\nit's, I made a show about weed.\n\n12:05.440 --> 12:07.560\nIt's like a mockumentary comedy series.\n\n12:07.560 --> 12:09.240\nLet's get to that in a second.\n\n12:09.240 --> 12:10.240\nOkay.\n\n12:10.240 --> 12:11.240\nTell me about what you were saying.\n\n12:11.240 --> 12:12.240\nYeah.\n\n12:12.240 --> 12:19.240\nOr just starting naming fruits and I'll forget what I asked.\n\n12:19.240 --> 12:23.320\nStop saying you have options.\n\n12:23.320 --> 12:24.320\nStop saying what you're saying.\n\n12:24.320 --> 12:26.360\nWe'll go, go back to what we were saying.\n\n12:26.360 --> 12:27.360\nYeah.\n\n12:27.360 --> 12:28.360\nYeah.\n\n12:28.360 --> 12:29.960\nI'm uncomfortable too, Dan.\n\n12:29.960 --> 12:30.960\nYeah.\n\n12:30.960 --> 12:31.960\nYeah.\n\n12:31.960 --> 12:32.960\nI'm, I'm, I'm in my own.\n\n12:32.960 --> 12:33.960\nApples.\n\n12:33.960 --> 12:34.960\nCan you describe getting too high?\n\n12:34.960 --> 12:36.360\nCause people use the word paranoid.\n\n12:36.360 --> 12:40.520\nAnd when I was in my twenties, I never understood what the old guys meant when they said, I\n\n12:40.520 --> 12:42.520\ncan't smoke pot anymore.\n\n12:42.520 --> 12:43.520\nI get paranoid.\n\n12:43.520 --> 12:44.520\nAnd I never knew.\n\n12:44.520 --> 12:46.640\nI was like, first, that sounds fun.\n\n12:46.640 --> 12:47.640\nLike what?\n\n12:47.640 --> 12:53.560\nYou take a drug that makes you think people are out to get you because nobody's ever\n\n12:53.560 --> 12:55.560\nbeen out to get you when you're 20.\n\n12:55.560 --> 12:58.000\nAnd so you're like, that sounds like a pill I'd take.\n\n12:58.000 --> 12:59.000\nRight.\n\n12:59.000 --> 13:00.000\nRight.\n\n13:00.000 --> 13:01.000\nRight.\n\n13:01.000 --> 13:02.000\nYeah.\n\n13:02.000 --> 13:03.000\nLike I play video games to be paranoid, but then, and then, and then, and then sometime\n\n13:03.000 --> 13:04.160\nin my thirties, I'm going to use my eye statements.\n\n13:04.160 --> 13:05.160\nI keep using you.\n\n13:05.160 --> 13:07.600\nAnd I'm like, come on, Harmon, speak for yourself.\n\n13:07.600 --> 13:12.560\nAnd then sometime in my thirties, I just, I had that first like, oh, I got too high.\n\n13:12.560 --> 13:15.400\nAnd I shouldn't be because I'm 30.\n\n13:15.400 --> 13:19.680\nAnd then I have rent due tomorrow.\n\n13:19.680 --> 13:23.040\nAnd like the heinous turn, I think that's what, I think that's what people mean when\n\n13:23.040 --> 13:24.040\nthey talk about paranoia.\n\n13:24.040 --> 13:28.840\nI think marijuana shows us things that we need to be attentive and pay attention to.\n\n13:28.840 --> 13:31.600\nYou know, it's like, fuck, gotta call my dad back.\n\n13:31.600 --> 13:34.200\nIt's been a few weeks and fuck, I gotta check the thing.\n\n13:34.200 --> 13:35.960\nAnd like, this doesn't feel good.\n\n13:35.960 --> 13:36.960\nLike what's here?\n\n13:36.960 --> 13:38.800\nLike the lung or is this like the liver?\n\n13:38.800 --> 13:41.680\nLike I gotta go, you know, and like you start getting your head about that.\n\n13:41.680 --> 13:45.880\nAnd I really do feel like pot is a thing that points out things you need to be attentive\n\n13:45.880 --> 13:46.880\nto.\n\n13:46.880 --> 13:50.920\nAnd part of like one of the reason where I think paranoia and uncomfortableness comes\n\n13:50.920 --> 13:55.520\nfrom is like people who maybe need to just check in with like breathing and just being\n\n13:55.520 --> 13:56.760\nin their moment and blah, blah, blah.\n\n13:56.760 --> 13:59.920\nBut yeah, to answer your question, most times I smoke weed.\n\n13:59.920 --> 14:02.720\nI'm like, fuck, I always forget this part where I smoke.\n\n14:02.720 --> 14:05.040\nAnd then I'm like, oh, we're back here again.\n\n14:05.040 --> 14:09.600\nYou know, it's like, oh, fuck, oh, now I'm in that place, how long is this gonna take?\n\n14:09.600 --> 14:13.240\nPart of our group that I travel with a lot is a guy we travel with and he doesn't like\n\n14:13.240 --> 14:18.520\nto fly and he takes his little tiny, like really, really low dosage, like little mints\n\n14:18.520 --> 14:25.040\nthat are weedy, you know, kind of edible mints, weedies, weedies, yeah, you got Bruce\n\n14:25.040 --> 14:30.200\nJenner on the cover of the thing and that's how old he's a guy.\n\n14:30.200 --> 14:35.360\nAnd he gave me, he's like, they put you right to sleep, like I sleep on plants, he goes\n\n14:35.360 --> 14:39.880\nup, but they're so relaxing, all the anxiety that I feel like, you won't even know that\n\n14:39.880 --> 14:40.880\nyou've taken it.\n\n14:40.880 --> 14:43.200\nI took it and I was fucking freaking out.\n\n14:43.200 --> 14:48.360\nI'm gonna play with my head and my hands going, oh, like, ah, like get me off of this\n\n14:48.360 --> 14:49.360\nfucking thing.\n\n14:49.360 --> 14:54.040\nI remember being in an animal collective concert and biting my hand until it bled because I\n\n14:54.040 --> 14:59.080\nneeded to be rooted in like reality, like I bit my hand until I bled, like I was the\n\n14:59.080 --> 15:03.200\nguy in the crowd who was like, I'm having a good time, like, you know, like, this is\n\n15:03.200 --> 15:08.000\nfucking great at strawberry jam and like, and I would say that like most of the times\n\n15:08.000 --> 15:12.080\nwhenever I've been in like a, because I made a weed show, which by the way makes it very\n\n15:12.080 --> 15:16.440\ndifficult to sell your show because Broad City, they can smoke weed all day, but they\n\n15:16.440 --> 15:18.520\nwon't sell commercials to a weed thing.\n\n15:18.520 --> 15:20.160\nAnyway, that's the whole separate thing.\n\n15:20.160 --> 15:24.520\nThe thing about weed is like, if you're in a weed show and you go to it like a serious\n\n15:24.520 --> 15:27.360\nmeeting or like a blah, blah, blah, it's always like, oh, we brought weed because you're the\n\n15:27.360 --> 15:28.360\nfucking weed guy.\n\n15:28.360 --> 15:32.800\nLike you like being really high, really, really high right now and it just becomes a thing\n\n15:32.800 --> 15:35.480\nthat it's so normalized, but I'm still not.\n\n15:35.480 --> 15:37.760\nI have a very love hate relationship with pot.\n\n15:37.760 --> 15:40.360\nI think it's a really fucking heavy drug.\n\n15:40.360 --> 15:41.360\nSpencer.\n\n15:41.360 --> 15:42.360\nHey guys.\n\n15:42.360 --> 15:43.360\nI should be respected.\n\n15:43.360 --> 15:47.160\nI, uh, I understand fashion when I'm high.\n\n15:47.160 --> 15:54.440\nI put on, I smoke a, I smoke a doobie and then I'm like, yo, I need long pants.\n\n15:54.440 --> 15:55.440\nWhat's going on?\n\n15:55.440 --> 16:00.160\nI mean, I, that, that's, I mean, it's true and some, and that, that manifests like that\n\n16:00.160 --> 16:04.200\na thing of like, it's like changing what you're paying attention to, which never occurred\n\n16:04.200 --> 16:05.200\nto me.\n\n16:05.200 --> 16:06.200\nThat's exactly what it does.\n\n16:06.200 --> 16:10.800\nWhich, which if you're doing well, if you're in a good space, it could be like your girlfriend's\n\n16:10.800 --> 16:16.920\nbra strap or the fact that, uh, uh, you need to breathe like, but in a good way.\n\n16:16.920 --> 16:20.200\nNo, the, it's, it's like, I, I was trying to create a list because I was like, why did\n\n16:20.200 --> 16:21.800\nyou, why was your girlfriend's bra strap?\n\n16:21.800 --> 16:22.800\nThat's a solid start.\n\n16:22.800 --> 16:28.600\nThat's a bad one item list because now you're just a pervy, pervy guy that's like, uh, sometimes\n\n16:28.600 --> 16:33.320\nthe grass makes me twitchy, but it's cool with the chicks.\n\n16:33.320 --> 16:38.120\nI just, I just like, I became a dazed and confused character.\n\n16:38.120 --> 16:42.600\nI've never seen the movie, but I saw the trailer and like, I just, I'm so high.\n\n16:42.600 --> 16:47.280\nAnd then a, like right now there's paranoia that there's a voice going like, look at you.\n\n16:47.280 --> 16:48.280\nLook at you.\n\n16:48.280 --> 16:49.280\nListen to yourself.\n\n16:49.280 --> 16:50.280\nAre you listening to yourself?\n\n16:50.280 --> 16:51.280\nThat's my paranoia.\n\n16:51.280 --> 16:53.960\nI was like, everybody knows that I'm too high and they're going to make fun of me.\n\n16:53.960 --> 16:57.840\nThey're going to, they're going to ridicule me for being high and poke fun at me and well,\n\n16:57.840 --> 17:01.480\nI'm here to tell you, that's how you'll live.\n\n17:01.480 --> 17:03.440\nWhat's your, what's your own comfort right now?\n\n17:03.440 --> 17:04.440\nYou're at your own show.\n\n17:04.440 --> 17:05.440\nGetting better.\n\n17:05.440 --> 17:06.440\nOr like, what?\n\n17:06.440 --> 17:07.440\nOh no.\n\n17:07.440 --> 17:08.440\nWell, I know it, but it truly is.\n\n17:08.440 --> 17:12.440\nIt's funny how it's not always like, oh, a mortgage in a, I've got to hunt the spotted\n\n17:12.440 --> 17:13.440\nleopard next Wednesday.\n\n17:13.440 --> 17:18.200\nI'm trying to make up anxieties, trying to improvise a list of anxieties.\n\n17:18.200 --> 17:19.200\nNumber one was mortgage.\n\n17:19.200 --> 17:21.400\nStraight to mythical creature hunting.\n\n17:21.400 --> 17:23.480\nI guess I've never had to worry about anything.\n\n17:23.480 --> 17:25.440\nDan, go back to what you were saying.\n\n17:25.440 --> 17:28.840\nLike that was where a normal person would have like, I've got to clean the gutters or\n\n17:28.840 --> 17:35.880\ntie my shoes or, you know, not enjoy total fucking psychic hegemony over all creatures\n\n17:35.880 --> 17:41.920\ngreat and small to the point where I have to create my own crises so that I can feel\n\n17:41.920 --> 17:42.920\nvaluable.\n\n17:42.920 --> 17:49.120\nI can feel the tension of me pushing up against failure as otherwise I don't know if I'm\n\n17:49.120 --> 17:50.120\nalive.\n\n17:50.120 --> 17:53.320\nAnyway, so you made this, I'm just really happy.\n\n17:53.320 --> 17:54.320\nI'm not high right now.\n\n17:54.320 --> 17:57.600\nLike, I would be staring at you being like, got to think the funny thing.\n\n17:57.600 --> 17:58.600\nGot it.\n\n17:58.600 --> 17:59.600\nGot to follow you.\n\n17:59.600 --> 18:00.600\nGot to follow you up that.\n\n18:00.600 --> 18:01.600\nAll right.\n\n18:01.600 --> 18:03.600\nSo tell us about dope state.\n\n18:03.600 --> 18:04.600\nYeah.\n\n18:04.600 --> 18:05.600\nThank you for saying.\n\n18:05.600 --> 18:06.600\nOh, yeah.\n\n18:06.600 --> 18:07.600\nGreat smile from Jeff.\n\n18:07.600 --> 18:09.600\nI'm feeling rooted on here.\n\n18:09.600 --> 18:10.600\nDope states show.\n\n18:10.600 --> 18:11.600\nWe made it.\n\n18:11.600 --> 18:16.720\nStarbucks Industries took a couple years and was a, it's a mockumentary set in the cannabis\n\n18:16.720 --> 18:19.400\nculture boom in California.\n\n18:19.400 --> 18:26.640\nAnd I play a handful of characters, dab girls, daddies, dealer, well, no, you play a dealer\n\n18:26.640 --> 18:27.640\nin it.\n\n18:27.640 --> 18:31.480\nAnd, and then we're surrounded by a lot of comedians, most of which are in the starburn\n\n18:31.480 --> 18:34.760\nspace at least some degree, kind of passing through and showing everything from like Silicon\n\n18:34.760 --> 18:39.480\nValley culture to the people getting pushed out of the industry, which is what I grew\n\n18:39.480 --> 18:44.120\nup around, you know, growers and dealers who are now getting pushed out because of dispensaries\n\n18:44.120 --> 18:45.120\nand all that.\n\n18:45.120 --> 18:51.320\nThe first season, six episodes on Pluto TV, and it really focuses on the old school pot\n\n18:51.320 --> 18:57.760\ngame that's being like completely just decimated by big, the big cannabis boom right now.\n\n18:57.760 --> 19:02.960\nPluto TV, Pluto TV, it's free TV Spence on Pluto and Earth.\n\n19:02.960 --> 19:03.960\nYeah.\n\n19:03.960 --> 19:04.960\nYeah.\n\n19:04.960 --> 19:05.960\nChannel 420.\n\n19:05.960 --> 19:08.960\nWe're on the wheat channel channel.\n\n19:08.960 --> 19:10.760\nPluto TV is channel 420.\n\n19:10.760 --> 19:13.760\nNo, no, no, it's 420 on on Pluto TV.\n\n19:13.760 --> 19:18.720\nSo you get on your phone and then channel 420 is the, is the, the wheat, the wheat channel.\n\n19:18.720 --> 19:24.280\nA couple of days ago, Cody informed me was the, your last chance to get married and have\n\n19:24.280 --> 19:28.240\nyour 50th anniversary be on 42069.\n\n19:28.240 --> 19:29.240\nYeah.\n\n19:29.240 --> 19:34.320\nAnd we were like, we were reaching for the keys, like on our way to city hall.\n\n19:34.320 --> 19:40.400\nAnd then we're like, can you imagine trying to get that laugh 50 years from now?\n\n19:40.400 --> 19:48.280\nYou'd be like, first I have to explain calendars to a fucking hologram of a, of Pokemon that's\n\n19:48.280 --> 19:52.520\njust like coming through my id because no one's real anymore.\n\n19:52.520 --> 19:54.080\nLike there is no people.\n\n19:54.080 --> 19:58.320\nThere would be, there's no, if there's people 50 years from now, I quit.\n\n19:58.320 --> 19:59.320\nI quit.\n\n19:59.320 --> 20:00.320\nYeah.\n\n20:00.320 --> 20:01.320\nSorry.\n\n20:01.320 --> 20:02.320\nI cut you off.\n\n20:02.320 --> 20:07.040\nDo you, do you have any opinions about the corporatization of marijuana?\n\n20:07.040 --> 20:12.760\nUh, I think it's, you know, there's, there's the, the, the schism, schism between legalization\n\n20:12.760 --> 20:14.600\nand decriminalization.\n\n20:14.600 --> 20:19.680\nAnd obviously in California, we chose legalization and that opens the door for big businesses\n\n20:19.680 --> 20:25.560\nto steal all the businesses of honest drug dealers without, you know, preventing drug\n\n20:25.560 --> 20:30.040\ndealings, just selling a product, you know, the medicine people do it and we, we say it's\n\n20:30.040 --> 20:31.040\ngreat.\n\n20:31.040 --> 20:34.000\nBut, uh, you know, they're just taking all the business from all these, these earnest,\n\n20:34.000 --> 20:38.080\nhardworking folk that have been fulfilling a big need and getting arrested for it, which\n\n20:38.080 --> 20:39.080\nis bad.\n\n20:39.080 --> 20:42.600\nAnd obviously they're not, I don't even know why I have to ask this out loud, but because\n\n20:42.600 --> 20:45.160\nthere's probably some discussion about it.\n\n20:45.160 --> 20:47.760\nWhy am I you explaining why you ask questions?\n\n20:47.760 --> 20:48.760\nBecause you're high.\n\n20:48.760 --> 20:53.000\nYou're high as bat pussy, right?\n\n20:53.000 --> 20:54.000\nWhoa.\n\n20:54.000 --> 20:57.000\nAnd they sleep upside down.\n\n20:57.000 --> 20:58.000\nBelfrees.\n\n20:58.000 --> 20:59.000\nYeah.\n\n20:59.000 --> 21:00.000\nThey sleep upside down.\n\n21:00.000 --> 21:02.000\nThat's about as high as, that's high as it gets.\n\n21:02.000 --> 21:04.600\nThey live in belfrees and they sleep upside down.\n\n21:04.600 --> 21:08.320\nI heard that from Steve Agee, I'm like, that's the greatest I've ever heard in my life.\n\n21:08.320 --> 21:12.440\nYou don't get any higher in the animal kingdom than a bat pussy.\n\n21:12.440 --> 21:16.760\nThey sleep on the ceiling, but upside down so their head is lower than their person.\n\n21:16.760 --> 21:21.920\nAnd it's not just bat genitals because the male bat penis immediately flaps down like\n\n21:21.920 --> 21:25.160\nan ironing board in a hotel as soon as it goes to sleep.\n\n21:25.160 --> 21:29.480\nAnd it's just every inch counts, ask the people that built the belfree, why'd you put that\n\n21:29.480 --> 21:32.200\ncross up there if it wasn't to beat the church across the street?\n\n21:32.200 --> 21:35.600\nYou know, in this arms race for God's grace, what am I saying?\n\n21:35.600 --> 21:37.200\nNo, this is good.\n\n21:37.200 --> 21:38.200\nThis is good.\n\n21:38.200 --> 21:39.200\nIt's illegalization.\n\n21:39.200 --> 21:42.200\nIt's some ASPD stuff.\n\n21:42.200 --> 21:43.200\nWhat?\n\n21:43.200 --> 21:44.200\nWhat?\n\n21:44.200 --> 21:45.200\nWhy?\n\n21:45.200 --> 21:49.120\nThe propositions are passed and then legalizations put through.\n\n21:49.120 --> 21:50.800\nShould I get you some popcorn or something like that?\n\n21:50.800 --> 21:51.800\nYou want some snacks?\n\n21:51.800 --> 21:52.800\nWe can get some pizza.\n\n21:52.800 --> 21:53.800\nCall the police.\n\n21:53.800 --> 21:54.800\nYes.\n\n21:54.800 --> 21:55.800\nOh, I did.\n\n21:55.800 --> 21:56.800\nThey're coming.\n\n21:56.800 --> 22:00.720\nI just want to, I just want to talk to someone that will put me straight.\n\n22:00.720 --> 22:04.920\nNo, this is actually perfect because I'm experiencing the other side of the pot thing.\n\n22:04.920 --> 22:09.000\nLike if you having a little bit of like uncomfort, I was really high yesterday at the Renaissance\n\n22:09.000 --> 22:10.000\nFair.\n\n22:10.000 --> 22:11.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n22:11.000 --> 22:12.520\nWe didn't go to the another renter.\n\n22:12.520 --> 22:16.880\nGeorge R. Martin was there two years ago, I saw him hit a little like dinky dragon on\n\n22:16.880 --> 22:17.880\nhis shoulder.\n\n22:17.880 --> 22:20.880\nLike he was walking around just buying his meats and drink.\n\n22:20.880 --> 22:22.600\nHe was, he was having a ball.\n\n22:22.600 --> 22:23.600\nJust buying his.\n\n22:23.600 --> 22:26.840\nBut I'm, but I'm a great bunch of shop there.\n\n22:26.840 --> 22:30.240\nYou go get a nice tenderloin, sweet turkey leg.\n\n22:30.240 --> 22:32.240\nYeah.\n\n22:32.240 --> 22:38.800\nI'm experiencing the next day weed lackadaisical lethargy of like the mind of like bad pussy.\n\n22:38.800 --> 22:40.640\nI got something to say about that.\n\n22:40.640 --> 22:45.880\nAnd then it's like like someone pressing against my forehead, just like setting me back.\n\n22:45.880 --> 22:46.880\nLike that's what I get.\n\n22:46.880 --> 22:51.040\nThat's the negative side effects for weed for me is like the hangover is like that.\n\n22:51.040 --> 22:52.040\nYeah, the weed hangover.\n\n22:52.040 --> 22:53.040\nI hate the weed hangover.\n\n22:53.040 --> 22:54.040\nI love it.\n\n22:54.040 --> 22:58.120\nOh, I, I actually I'm trying to stop smoking weed.\n\n22:58.120 --> 23:01.560\nI've been getting paranoia and panic attacks lately.\n\n23:01.560 --> 23:02.560\nNot great.\n\n23:02.560 --> 23:03.560\nI was in line somewhere.\n\n23:03.560 --> 23:04.800\nI thought I was having a heart attack.\n\n23:04.800 --> 23:08.040\nYeah, I might have been having a heart attack.\n\n23:08.040 --> 23:11.920\nYou pace back and forth and you're like checking your pulse because if you're going to have\n\n23:11.920 --> 23:13.720\na heart attack, you want to be the first to know, right?\n\n23:13.720 --> 23:17.680\nYou're the I mean, no one else way to do that kids is to just always check your pulse.\n\n23:17.680 --> 23:21.360\nIs that just after smoking like you just after smoking it was in that case.\n\n23:21.360 --> 23:22.360\nYeah.\n\n23:22.360 --> 23:23.360\nYeah.\n\n23:23.360 --> 23:28.560\nIn these war movies, you know, like a bombshell goes off nearby the person and they have this\n\n23:28.560 --> 23:31.640\nringing in their ears and they can't hear anything that was happening to me.\n\n23:31.640 --> 23:34.120\nAnd I was like, wait, that doesn't happen in real life.\n\n23:34.120 --> 23:35.120\nThat's a movie thing.\n\n23:35.120 --> 23:36.120\nI'm dying.\n\n23:36.120 --> 23:41.800\nAnd no, I swear I was going to mention that like I and then I thought don't bring that\n\n23:41.800 --> 23:42.800\nup.\n\n23:42.800 --> 23:46.240\nLike that's not that's a subjective experience for you, but it's interesting that you brought\n\n23:46.240 --> 23:47.240\nthat up.\n\n23:47.240 --> 23:50.280\nYeah, because you've probably heard people say I get panic attacks and I never looked\n\n23:50.280 --> 23:53.400\nup what a panic attack was and I was like, yeah, I freak out all the time.\n\n23:53.400 --> 23:54.400\nWhat?\n\n23:54.400 --> 23:56.840\nBut like, no, a panic attack is like a medical thing where it feels like you're having a\n\n23:56.840 --> 23:57.840\nheart attack or whatever.\n\n23:57.840 --> 23:58.840\nIt's terrifying.\n\n23:58.840 --> 24:00.240\nAnd that's been happening.\n\n24:00.240 --> 24:01.240\nIt's no good.\n\n24:01.240 --> 24:02.240\nI've been trying.\n\n24:02.240 --> 24:04.440\nI smoked on 420, but I haven't really smoked the last couple of weeks.\n\n24:04.440 --> 24:06.200\nI don't I don't think I'm going to keep smoking.\n\n24:06.200 --> 24:14.120\nNow, do you think gentlemen for the panel, yes, do you think that that is a function of\n\n24:14.120 --> 24:21.480\nbiology, chemicals or anything, or is that more psychology, your your life changing and\n\n24:21.480 --> 24:28.400\ngetting getting high, having the same effect on you that you're you're parsing it differently\n\n24:28.400 --> 24:30.960\nbecause you your your life is changing.\n\n24:30.960 --> 24:33.040\nI would guess aging has something to do with it.\n\n24:33.040 --> 24:37.440\nAnd I've read just long term weed use leads to different side effects than short term\n\n24:37.440 --> 24:38.440\nweed use.\n\n24:38.440 --> 24:41.480\nSo after you've been doing it for several years, it can actually affect you psychologically\n\n24:41.480 --> 24:44.080\ndifferently than the first seven years or something.\n\n24:44.080 --> 24:46.920\nSo it might just be like late weed use or something.\n\n24:46.920 --> 24:48.520\nWhen did we become such squares?\n\n24:48.520 --> 24:50.000\nI mean, I've heard of it.\n\n24:50.000 --> 24:54.880\nI think it's pretty common for people as they get older to be like, I was really into weed\n\n24:54.880 --> 24:59.480\nand then now I'm feeling like all those negative things and I've got no time for it.\n\n24:59.480 --> 25:00.920\nBut like it does.\n\n25:00.920 --> 25:06.880\nYeah, it has it for I especially being recently like doing promotion and all this for this\n\n25:06.880 --> 25:11.480\nand like I've been thrusted in the scene of like go weed, like it's the fucking thing\n\n25:11.480 --> 25:12.480\nfor everything.\n\n25:12.480 --> 25:13.480\nOh, yeah.\n\n25:13.480 --> 25:14.480\nIt's CBD.\n\n25:14.480 --> 25:15.480\nYeah.\n\n25:15.480 --> 25:16.480\nAnd CBD.\n\n25:16.480 --> 25:17.480\nAnd I've had some really good experiences, CBD that didn't freak me out.\n\n25:17.480 --> 25:22.240\nBut like it's still it's still a pretty intense drug that thrown into it's just not all the\n\n25:22.240 --> 25:23.240\nheal all end all.\n\n25:23.240 --> 25:24.920\nAnd I think it's more of that.\n\n25:24.920 --> 25:27.840\nIt's got this collective excitement behind it, which is wonderful.\n\n25:27.840 --> 25:28.840\nLike I love that.\n\n25:28.840 --> 25:33.600\nBut it's also like, you know, you can't you can't throw it into any mental situation.\n\n25:33.600 --> 25:34.600\nYeah.\n\n25:34.600 --> 25:35.600\nYou know, and especially like edibles.\n\n25:35.600 --> 25:39.760\nLike I think God we're in a day where you can pick out the thing for the airport because\n\n25:39.760 --> 25:42.680\nlike, okay, my mom would hate that I would tell.\n\n25:42.680 --> 25:46.440\nMy mom would not like that I would tell this story because she so there's still a little\n\n25:46.440 --> 25:51.360\nshame in my family between weed, but my mom grew pot this year and like she got like two\n\n25:51.360 --> 25:52.360\npounds.\n\n25:52.360 --> 25:53.360\nIt was like a huge amount of people.\n\n25:53.360 --> 25:54.360\nI don't know.\n\n25:54.360 --> 25:55.360\nIs that like an illegal amount?\n\n25:55.360 --> 25:56.360\nWhat's your address?\n\n25:56.360 --> 25:57.360\nMy parents are going to get like raided now.\n\n25:57.360 --> 25:58.360\nYeah.\n\n25:58.360 --> 26:03.680\nAnd my mom was like, she doesn't smoke, but she wanted to like make it for her kid and\n\n26:03.680 --> 26:04.680\nhis friends.\n\n26:04.680 --> 26:06.600\nShe wanted to give it a shot.\n\n26:06.600 --> 26:07.680\nShe grew two pounds.\n\n26:07.680 --> 26:08.680\nYeah.\n\n26:08.680 --> 26:11.040\nWell, she's a fucking Bay Area like green thumb lady.\n\n26:11.040 --> 26:12.760\nShe's like, I plan in the past.\n\n26:12.760 --> 26:19.440\nI was going to say, yeah, agent, like everything she does or no, she's got a green thumb.\n\n26:19.440 --> 26:20.440\nThat's adorable.\n\n26:20.440 --> 26:21.440\nYeah.\n\n26:21.440 --> 26:22.440\nIt was adorable.\n\n26:22.440 --> 26:29.600\nAnd so my adorable 72 year old mother, 71, she was cooking it to make us these little\n\n26:29.600 --> 26:31.320\nspace balls.\n\n26:31.320 --> 26:34.240\nAnd when you cook THC, so what's a space ball?\n\n26:34.240 --> 26:37.600\nSpace balls like a little thing like like this big and you put is that like not a term\n\n26:37.600 --> 26:40.680\nthat's like a big to good like a space cake space.\n\n26:40.680 --> 26:41.680\nSpace cake.\n\n26:41.680 --> 26:44.240\nI've heard this, but these are these come in spherical form little like munchie.\n\n26:44.240 --> 26:45.240\nYeah.\n\n26:45.240 --> 26:47.080\nA little munchie think they're healthy made of organic stuff.\n\n26:47.080 --> 26:53.320\nBut what she didn't know is that when you cook it into oil, that's that psycho that's\n\n26:53.320 --> 27:00.280\npsycho activates that psycho activates the weed and then it channelizes the psychoactivization\n\n27:00.280 --> 27:01.280\nof process.\n\n27:01.280 --> 27:02.280\nRight.\n\n27:02.280 --> 27:07.040\nI mean, science where you want to get it's logical.\n\n27:07.040 --> 27:08.280\nIt intensifies the cycle.\n\n27:08.280 --> 27:09.280\nNo, no, no.\n\n27:09.280 --> 27:10.280\nIt turns it on.\n\n27:10.280 --> 27:14.440\nIt's not the psychoactive property of weed is not really turned on unless it's heat activated\n\n27:14.440 --> 27:15.440\nfrom what I know.\n\n27:15.440 --> 27:19.400\nAnd when you put that into oil and you cook it, it's it's hot.\n\n27:19.400 --> 27:20.400\nIt's ready.\n\n27:20.400 --> 27:26.440\nAnd my mom then without gloves started making these little space cakes with like, oh, this\n\n27:26.440 --> 27:29.120\nis not where I thought the story was going at all.\n\n27:29.120 --> 27:31.120\nSo I get a, I get a call from my sister.\n\n27:31.120 --> 27:33.720\nI'm in a wedding and I get a guy to come home.\n\n27:33.720 --> 27:34.720\nOh my God.\n\n27:34.720 --> 27:35.720\nMom is like, is gone.\n\n27:35.720 --> 27:39.720\nI was like, well, I had one of them like it's a little heavy, but like just, you know, tell\n\n27:39.720 --> 27:42.400\nher to sit down, put on some discovery, whatever.\n\n27:42.400 --> 27:47.960\nAnd I come home and my mom had ingested like an ounce of pot and she was, she was puking.\n\n27:47.960 --> 27:53.280\nShe was freaking out, watching my mother, you know, go through like a bad trip, which\n\n27:53.280 --> 27:58.200\nwas all, you know, it was, she was so scared.\n\n27:58.200 --> 28:04.720\nAnd I sat with her and she was like, Gabe's home, Gabe, Gabe, you know, like it was like\n\n28:04.720 --> 28:09.160\ndeath bed, shit, you know, and I like, and I can't, and she was like grabbing for me.\n\n28:09.160 --> 28:10.160\nAnd she was like, I can't look.\n\n28:10.160 --> 28:11.160\nIt's too bright.\n\n28:11.160 --> 28:14.960\nAnd every time she'd open her eyes, she'd be like, oh no, this is too bright.\n\n28:14.960 --> 28:19.360\nAnd then she's like, did Red Dead Redemption come out yet?\n\n28:19.360 --> 28:20.360\nI missed it.\n\n28:20.360 --> 28:24.680\nLike, mom, I've never seen you like this.\n\n28:24.680 --> 28:28.640\nAnd she, and she like grabbed me and like held me and like held my hand and she was like\n\n28:28.640 --> 28:32.640\nshaking and I was, I was like, mom, I've been a burning man like eight times.\n\n28:32.640 --> 28:37.040\nYou're the fucking highest person I have ever seen.\n\n28:37.040 --> 28:38.040\nAnd it was legit.\n\n28:38.040 --> 28:39.040\nIt was topical.\n\n28:39.040 --> 28:41.160\nIt was like, it went into her hands.\n\n28:41.160 --> 28:42.920\nShe didn't smoke any of it.\n\n28:42.920 --> 28:48.400\nAnd then it got awesome because I sat with her and we did like Technahan, like breathing\n\n28:48.400 --> 28:49.400\nshit.\n\n28:49.400 --> 28:52.960\nAnd like, I leaned into her ear and I was like, breathe in, breathe out, breathe in, breathe\n\n28:52.960 --> 28:53.960\nout.\n\n28:53.960 --> 28:57.000\nI sat with her for two hours and pretty soon my mom was like, we're spinning to the left,\n\n28:57.000 --> 29:00.680\nGabe, and you're with me and it's us.\n\n29:00.680 --> 29:04.640\nAnd we're spinning to the left, to the left.\n\n29:04.640 --> 29:08.680\nThat made me so relaxed just now.\n\n29:08.680 --> 29:10.120\nI recorded it.\n\n29:10.120 --> 29:14.160\nShe was like, listen to what I'm saying to you and never forget.\n\n29:14.160 --> 29:15.960\nAnd it was always to the left.\n\n29:15.960 --> 29:16.960\nRight.\n\n29:16.960 --> 29:17.960\nRight.\n\n29:17.960 --> 29:18.960\nBack into the left.\n\n29:18.960 --> 29:19.960\nIt was like, whoa.\n\n29:19.960 --> 29:20.960\nThe Holocaust happens.\n\n29:20.960 --> 29:23.080\nDon't let them convince you.\n\n29:23.080 --> 29:24.080\nFollow the money.\n\n29:24.080 --> 29:25.240\nSilent greenest people.\n\n29:25.240 --> 29:26.240\nFollow the money.\n\n29:26.240 --> 29:27.240\nEverything to the left.\n\n29:27.240 --> 29:28.440\nShit came out.\n\n29:28.440 --> 29:31.480\nShe was like, get everybody from the family out here right now.\n\n29:31.480 --> 29:32.480\nSo we all come out.\n\n29:32.480 --> 29:33.480\nMy dad's there.\n\n29:33.480 --> 29:37.640\nMy dad, who has no idea how to handle this shit, he's like, honey, your kids love you.\n\n29:37.640 --> 29:39.640\nMy mom's like, stop it.\n\n29:39.640 --> 29:43.120\nDon't talk to me about anything.\n\n29:43.120 --> 29:44.960\nIt was coming up.\n\n29:44.960 --> 29:52.280\nAnd I was like, mom, Jesus, Lord, like, you know, like, but we ended up holding hands\n\n29:52.280 --> 29:57.200\nand I was crying and she was crying.\n\n29:57.200 --> 30:01.200\nAnd to what extent I get the feeling, I think, from talking to you before, but I kind of\n\n30:01.200 --> 30:07.560\nhope I'm wrong, that your parents are kind of, you know, on the front side of this, this\n\n30:07.560 --> 30:11.800\nbox, your parents aren't like principles in a Pringles commercial.\n\n30:11.800 --> 30:15.080\nThey're, they're, your parents are hippies, right?\n\n30:15.080 --> 30:17.520\nMr. and Mrs. Mike Pence, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n30:17.520 --> 30:18.520\nBack into the left.\n\n30:18.520 --> 30:19.520\nFuck, mother.\n\n30:19.520 --> 30:20.520\nFuck.\n\n30:20.520 --> 30:25.120\nNo flavor crystals in my library.\n\n30:25.120 --> 30:29.080\nWhoa, it's fucking reefer.\n\n30:29.080 --> 30:31.640\nIt's a little, but somehow that makes it more interesting.\n\n30:31.640 --> 30:32.640\nYeah.\n\n30:32.640 --> 30:33.640\nI mean, she grew it.\n\n30:33.640 --> 30:34.640\nAnd my dad was.\n\n30:34.640 --> 30:35.640\nShe grew it.\n\n30:35.640 --> 30:36.640\nThat's all you need to know about that answer.\n\n30:36.640 --> 30:41.120\nBut she grew it and, and then my dad was like, yeah, he just was uncomfortable about the\n\n30:41.120 --> 30:42.120\nwhole thing.\n\n30:42.120 --> 30:43.120\nYeah.\n\n30:43.120 --> 30:46.840\nI mean, we're in like the Bay Area and, you know, that, but I still say to anybody listening,\n\n30:46.840 --> 30:50.360\nyou know, with the whole normalization of shit, we got to catch up with this crap.\n\n30:50.360 --> 30:53.640\nYou fucking can't cook your weed and touch it with your hands.\n\n30:53.640 --> 30:56.920\nLike that must be happening all over to moms.\n\n30:56.920 --> 31:03.920\nI went to moms across the nation making their kids up their, their weed and giving me a big\n\n31:03.920 --> 31:07.480\nball of hash and I, and I, someone told me how to make butter out of it.\n\n31:07.480 --> 31:11.560\nAnd so I made this, just like buttered the exact color of your jumpsuit, like it's really\n\n31:11.560 --> 31:12.560\nkhaki green.\n\n31:12.560 --> 31:13.560\nIt's really into the jumpsuit.\n\n31:13.560 --> 31:18.040\nAnd, and it showed me how to make butter and I did, I did heat it.\n\n31:18.040 --> 31:22.600\nI put it in the thing and, and I made, I made cookies out of it.\n\n31:22.600 --> 31:27.520\nAnd I thought, I'm going to, I'm going to take a half a cookie, give it like a few hours.\n\n31:27.520 --> 31:31.520\nLet's do the baseline control group thing and see if it, if it, yeah, I got, I got a\n\n31:31.520 --> 31:32.520\nlittle high.\n\n31:32.520 --> 31:33.520\nIt was good.\n\n31:33.520 --> 31:36.680\nI was waiting a check at the time and she came over and we were going to go out and\n\n31:36.680 --> 31:37.680\ndo something.\n\n31:37.680 --> 31:42.560\nAnd I, I, I didn't, I forgot all about it that I'd taken it and I, I wasn't like tripping,\n\n31:42.560 --> 31:44.060\nyou know, like crazy.\n\n31:44.060 --> 31:50.200\nAnd she's sitting on my couch and she's like, Jeff, Jeff, I kind of snap out of a trance\n\n31:50.200 --> 31:57.520\nand I go, I go, I go, oh, oh, oh, oh, sorry, what, and she goes, are you okay?\n\n31:57.520 --> 31:58.520\nI'm like, what's going on?\n\n31:58.520 --> 32:01.520\nAnd she goes, you've been standing looking at the window for 10 minutes.\n\n32:01.520 --> 32:05.960\nI was like, yeah, that tree.\n\n32:05.960 --> 32:06.960\nI was there.\n\n32:06.960 --> 32:07.960\nShe's like, she's, she's sat there.\n\n32:07.960 --> 32:08.960\nShe's like, what is he doing?\n\n32:08.960 --> 32:11.760\nI was like, oh, oh, yeah, I got high earlier.\n\n32:11.760 --> 32:13.880\nSo then I go, these are pretty good.\n\n32:13.880 --> 32:19.240\nAnd I took two and went to, here's a bad idea.\n\n32:19.240 --> 32:21.640\nAnybody see the movie Coraline?\n\n32:21.640 --> 32:22.640\nDon't see it.\n\n32:22.640 --> 32:23.640\nIn 3D.\n\n32:23.640 --> 32:24.640\nBad idea.\n\n32:24.640 --> 32:26.720\nDo not, do not see that on way too much edibles.\n\n32:26.720 --> 32:27.720\nI was sitting with JJ.\n\n32:27.720 --> 32:33.600\nI don't know if that movie never came out in 3D, 3D, 3D, 3D.\n\n32:33.600 --> 32:42.880\nThat was, that was a rare 2D only movie by Decree of a special dimensional commission.\n\n32:42.880 --> 32:43.880\nI was with J.\n\n32:43.880 --> 32:46.480\nJohnston and somebody else, maybe Mark Rivers, I don't know who it was.\n\n32:46.480 --> 32:49.520\nAnd I was like, like so freaked out.\n\n32:49.520 --> 32:52.000\nI was so paranoid, I couldn't breathe.\n\n32:52.000 --> 32:56.960\nAnd I couldn't do the 3D thing because they were flying into my head.\n\n32:56.960 --> 32:57.960\nSure.\n\n32:57.960 --> 32:58.960\nAnd it was, it was like, get out.\n\n32:58.960 --> 32:59.960\nAll the Coralines.\n\n32:59.960 --> 33:05.360\nI was trying to defend my brain from all of these demons and monsters and shit coming\n\n33:05.360 --> 33:06.360\nat me.\n\n33:06.360 --> 33:12.080\nBut if I took the glasses off, that's worse because now it's all blurry and fucked up.\n\n33:12.080 --> 33:14.480\nSo I just, and I didn't want to just sit there with my head in my hands, I want the\n\n33:14.480 --> 33:15.880\narc light right in the middle.\n\n33:15.880 --> 33:17.680\nAnd it was, it's so dark in there.\n\n33:17.680 --> 33:26.920\nAnd the arc light in Hollywood, I'm sure they all are, but the Hollywood burn is fucking\n\n33:26.920 --> 33:27.920\ndark.\n\n33:27.920 --> 33:33.360\nI went to Pasadena, I'm like fucking, I could see my popcorn bro.\n\n33:33.360 --> 33:40.800\nIt's like, film snobs go there, it's like a richer black, it's a higher quality black,\n\n33:40.800 --> 33:44.840\nit brings out the silver and the nitrate behind the film.\n\n33:44.840 --> 33:45.840\nYeah, yeah.\n\n33:45.840 --> 33:46.840\nNo exit sign.\n\n33:46.840 --> 33:51.840\nAnd so if I try to get up and walk at her, I'm going to fall over everybody and I'm going\n\n33:51.840 --> 33:54.040\nto break my neck and make a fool of myself.\n\n33:54.040 --> 33:57.520\nIt's like, I'm not going to make it through this movie and I want to just sit there with\n\n33:57.520 --> 34:01.920\nmy head in my hands, but I was going to ruin the movie for my people next to me.\n\n34:01.920 --> 34:07.200\nSo I toughed it out and I don't remember anything about that movie except my own, just freak\n\n34:07.200 --> 34:08.200\nout.\n\n34:08.200 --> 34:14.400\nAnd we all went, we went our separate ways at the end, I think we all met there.\n\n34:14.400 --> 34:18.040\nAnd like, I calmed down towards the end.\n\n34:18.040 --> 34:22.240\nAnd the next day I called up those guys I was with and I said, hey, I don't know if\n\n34:22.240 --> 34:28.840\nyou noticed, I'm sorry, like I was fucking high and I was freaking out the whole movie\n\n34:28.840 --> 34:31.640\nand they're like, dude, I was too.\n\n34:31.640 --> 34:33.320\nAll three of us were in the exact same boat.\n\n34:33.320 --> 34:39.520\nWe were afraid to like, if I would have known that we just talk about it to the left, to\n\n34:39.520 --> 34:40.520\nthe left.\n\n34:40.520 --> 34:46.560\nAnd you guys were all like, man, of all the nights to roll with the Coraline intensive\n\n34:46.560 --> 34:47.560\ncrew.\n\n34:47.560 --> 34:54.200\nLike you're like, shit, fuck, you're supposed to be totally intense about watching Coraline\n\n34:54.200 --> 34:55.200\nin this group.\n\n34:55.200 --> 34:57.960\nAnd you were all just high.\n\n34:57.960 --> 35:01.880\nIf you know where I live and you go through my trash can, when's trash day, Thursday?\n\n35:01.880 --> 35:07.200\nYeah, if you go through my trash can, there's drugs in there because I somebody gave me\n\n35:07.200 --> 35:12.360\nthese beautifully noted.\n\n35:12.360 --> 35:14.680\nThat's a great cold open to your next story.\n\n35:14.680 --> 35:16.160\nIs that what that is?\n\n35:16.160 --> 35:17.160\nIs that what that was?\n\n35:17.160 --> 35:22.680\nWell, it's a paranoid thing to say, just as like a wizard panel right before it all know\n\n35:22.680 --> 35:23.680\nwhere I live.\n\n35:23.680 --> 35:24.680\nI know you're going through my fucking trash.\n\n35:24.680 --> 35:28.400\nIf you do it again tonight, I fucks my name is Jeff Davis.\n\n35:28.400 --> 35:29.400\nWho am I?\n\n35:29.400 --> 35:30.400\nLet's put it this way.\n\n35:30.400 --> 35:31.400\nYou go to my trash.\n\n35:31.400 --> 35:32.920\nWell, there'll be drugs there.\n\n35:32.920 --> 35:33.920\nWelcome to the show.\n\n35:33.920 --> 35:38.720\nI like the hash browns and scrambled eggs and then and then you're like, anyways, the\n\n35:38.720 --> 35:44.560\nA story this week is I lost my keys, but it's anyway, continue, please.\n\n35:44.560 --> 35:49.360\nThere's a guy, there's a guy that used to go to the drawing room and he he he's a let's\n\n35:49.360 --> 35:56.320\ncall him a drug dealer and get rid of this shame culture.\n\n35:56.320

drugs and I'd paid him money for them and then he had money and\n\n36:05.240 --> 36:07.720\nI had drugs and now some of them are in the trash can.\n\n36:07.720 --> 36:13.440\nStop calling yourself a friend that has drugs when your friends have money and want drugs.\n\n36:13.440 --> 36:15.680\nYou're a drug dealer, man.\n\n36:15.680 --> 36:16.680\nExactly.\n\n36:16.680 --> 36:17.680\nOwn

gave me some acid once and I took it\n\n36:26.400 --> 36:28.680\ntoo late and I fell asleep and don't sleep on acid.\n\n36:28.680 --> 36:30.800\nThat's the worst.\n\n36:30.800 --> 36:34.960\nWhat happens when you sleep on a fucking incredible?\n\n36:34.960 --> 36:36.520\nI fell asleep on the couch.\n\n36:36.520 --> 36:39.560\nI watched cabaret, the movie.\n\n36:39.560 --> 36:40.720\nIt's great.\n\n36:40.720 --> 36:41.880\nLike on acid.\n\n36:41.880 --> 36:44.120\nOn acid, it was fantastic but then I fell asleep on the couch.\n\n36:44.120 --> 36:45.120\nOh, cabaret on acid.\n\n36:45.120 --> 36:46.120\nFucking do it.\n\n36:46.120 --> 36:48.240\nAh, too demonic without the acid.\n\n36:48.240 --> 36:49.240\nIs it an aversion?\n\n36:49.240 --> 36:50.240\nYeah.\n\n36:50.240 --> 36:51.240\nIt starts up as like I had to hit pause.\n\n36:51.240 --> 36:52.720\nI'm like, I've seen this movie a hundred times.\n\n36:52.720 --> 36:57.360\nI'm like, I'm going to watch cabaret on acid and Joe Gray's face pops up in the first\n\n36:57.360 --> 37:02.000\nscene with a psh and his face was like this Ralph Steadham drawing.\n\n37:02.000 --> 37:04.000\nIt was fucking great.\n\n37:04.000 --> 37:05.000\nOh yeah.\n\n37:05.000 --> 37:11.840\nSo anyway, I fell asleep and I was still really going and you're inside this crazy\n\n37:11.840 --> 37:17.520\nfireball of imagery that's inside your eyelids.\n\n37:17.520 --> 37:19.920\nA champagne supernova?\n\n37:19.920 --> 37:24.160\nYou have to keep opening your eyes to get back to where's the plant?\n\n37:24.160 --> 37:25.160\nWhere's the TV?\n\n37:25.160 --> 37:27.080\nLike plant me somewhere.\n\n37:27.080 --> 37:30.120\nYou're tripping with your eyes closed.\n\n37:30.120 -->

got these things.\n\n37:35.720 --> 37:36.720\nI know you like mushrooms.\n\n37:36.720 --> 37:37.720\nHe goes, I've got these.\n\n37:37.720 --> 37:41.200\nThey look like little dove chocolate bars, little tiny ones that are wrapped in the\n\n37:41.200 --> 37:42.200\nred foil.\n\n37:42.200 --> 37:44.800\nThey're kind of square and rounded on the top.\n\n37:44.800 --> 37:49.800\nThey look exactly like that, like professional wrapping dove chocolates.\n\n37:49.800 --> 37:54.360\nAnd he goes, these are mushroom and a little marijuana.\n\n37:54.360 --> 37:58.440\nI'm like, OK, that sounds pretty groovy.\n\n37:58.440 --> 38:02.080\nWhere's the medicine that counteracts the...\n\n38:02.080 --> 38:04.880\nSteve, bring the ice and such.\n\n38:04.880 --> 38:05.880\nOK, now continue.\n\n38:05.880

Davis singing Cabaret.\n\n38:58.880 --> 39:03.240\nWhat good is staying alone in your room?\n\n39:03.240 --> 39:04.240\nThat's the finale.\n\n39:04.240 --> 39:05.240\nThat's not the beginning.\n\n39:05.240 --> 39:09.600\nWere you tripping out when all the little blonde Nazi boys were walking in a line in\n\n39:09.600 --> 39:10.600\nthe movie?\n\n39:10.600 --> 39:11.600\nYeah.\n\n39:11.600 --> 39:14.040\nTomato belongs to me, but that's fucking good.\n\n39:14.040 --> 39:20.080\nI've never seen Cabaret, because if I wanted to take acid, I'd take acid.\n\n39:20.080 --> 39:24.600\nI see the commercials for it, and he's like, maybe Envenu.\n\n39:24.600 --> 39:27.640\nAnd I'm like, no, I won't do it.\n\n39:27.640 --> 39:29.040\nI'm already scared of life.\n\n39:29.040 --> 39:31.440\nMy parents took me...\n\n39:31.440 --> 39:36.000\nI saw that with Joel Gray at the Music Center.\n\n39:36.000 --> 39:37.960\nHe goes to see his own shows?\n\n39:37.960 --> 39:38.960\nNo, no.\n\n39:38.960 --> 39:39.960\nI went to go see...\n\n39:39.960 --> 39:40.960\nWow.\n\n39:40.960 --> 39:41.960\nI went to go see...\n\n39:41.960 --> 39:42.960\nWith my parents.\n\n39:42.960 --> 39:44.200\nI was six or seven years old.\n\n39:44.200 --> 39:50.160\nWe went to go to see everything, big plays that came to LA.\n\n39:50.160 --> 39:58.320\nI was sitting there seven years old, six years old, and it's about Nazis and lesbians and\n\n39:58.320 --> 39:59.320\nabortions.\n\n39:59.320 --> 40:04.200\nI remember looking at my parents, like, this really isn't for me.\n\n40:04.200 --> 40:08.640\nI didn't know what any of it meant, but I remember thinking the people sitting near\n\n40:08.640 --> 40:11.240\nme, they're going to be like, there's a kid right here.\n\n40:11.240 --> 40:13.440\nAnd the way home, I'm in the car...\n\n40:13.440 --> 40:18.360\nIt was a song about Monge Toie, and my parents were just laughing.\n\n40:18.360 --> 40:19.360\nI remember that.\n\n40:19.360 --> 40:20.360\nI had no idea what it was.\n\n40:20.360 --> 40:22.800\nSo anyway, the guy comes in with these chocolates.\n\n40:22.800 --> 40:26.760\nAnd I buy the chocolates and I take the chocolate and I thought...\n\n40:26.760 --> 40:34.520\nOh, I didn't like it, because the mushroom thing happens, but then the weed comes in.\n\n40:34.520 --> 40:35.520\nThe edible thing came in.\n\n40:35.520 --> 40:36.960\nBut you were on acid and tea?\n\n40:36.960 --> 40:37.960\nNo, no, no.\n\n40:37.960 --> 40:38.960\nThis is different.\n\n40:38.960 --> 40:39.960\nOkay, different time.\n\n40:39.960 --> 40:40.960\nDifferent thing.\n\n40:40.960 --> 40:42.480\nIt's not a good story.\n\n40:42.480 --> 40:47.400\nI tried them twice, and I didn't like them, because the weed part, unlike you, weed fucks\n\n40:47.400 --> 40:48.400\nme up.\n\n40:48.400 --> 40:50.840\nI get way too affected by marijuana.\n\n40:50.840 --> 40:57.600\nI smoke my fair share of weed, and I can get down, but I...\n\n40:57.600 --> 40:58.600\nYou're still cool?\n\n40:58.600 --> 41:00.080\nYeah, I'm still cool.\n\n41:00.080 --> 41:01.080\nYou still got it?\n\n41:01.080 --> 41:03.960\nI don't want to be distracted by this for the rest of the night, but I can help you with\n\n41:03.960 --> 41:04.960\nthat story.\n\n41:04.960 --> 41:07.560\nI'm kind of like a Hollywood script doctor.\n\n41:07.560 --> 41:08.560\nWhoa.\n\n41:08.560 --> 41:09.560\nBut if you want to...\n\n41:09.560 --> 41:10.560\nNo, no, no, no.\n\n41:10.560 --> 41:12.800\nIf you want to meet about it, if you want to put something together, like I'm between\n\n41:12.800 --> 41:15.520\nprojects, I've failed at all the other ones, and so...\n\n41:15.520 --> 41:19.560\nOkay, this is Dan Harmon, punches up Jeff's edible story.\n\n41:19.560 --> 41:21.800\nOh, I just want to put my hat in the ring.\n\n41:21.800 --> 41:22.800\nOh.\n\n41:22.800 --> 41:23.800\nAll right.\n\n41:23.800 --> 41:28.160\nWell, look, I want to work with you on finding the...\n\n41:28.160 --> 41:29.160\nOkay.\n\n41:29.160 --> 41:31.560\nWhy don't we all kind of bang it out together right now?\n\n41:31.560 --> 41:32.560\nYeah.\n\n41:32.560 --> 41:33.560\nOkay.\n\n41:33.560 --> 41:34.560\nSo you...\n\n41:34.560 --> 41:36.560\nAnd were you finished?\n\n41:36.560 --> 41:41.720\nBecause I didn't want to...\n\n41:41.720 --> 41:43.680\nI'm not going to interrupt the flow now.\n\n41:43.680 --> 41:44.680\nNo, no, no.\n\n41:44.680 --> 41:49.520\nAnd the unspoken part of that is, unlike you, Dan, I'm not a flow.\n\n41:49.520 --> 41:50.520\nI'm not a flow interrupter.\n\n41:50.520 --> 41:51.520\nDamn.\n\n41:51.520 --> 41:57.520\nOr are you telling me that I'm somehow able to reverse project shaming?\n\n41:57.520 --> 42:04.600\nBecause then I think I'd be a superhero if I could take anything that you said and turn\n\n42:04.600 --> 42:07.760\nit into me feeling bad about myself.\n\n42:07.760 --> 42:14.840\nI mean, I'd be out there fighting crime right now because who wouldn't want that power?\n\n42:14.840 --> 42:16.120\nReverse projecting shame?\n\n42:16.120 --> 42:23.080\nI can turn... I could find shame in... I've never thought about trying to use it for good.\n\n42:23.080 --> 42:25.760\nI will find shame in anything.\n\n42:25.760 --> 42:26.760\nOkay.\n\n42:26.760 --> 42:29.360\nIt's not a challenge.\n\n42:29.360 --> 42:31.280\nThis area of rug beneath your feet.\n\n42:31.280 --> 42:37.520\nIt reminds me of the fact that I don't know enough about carpet and that the last time\n\n42:37.520 --> 42:44.040\nI was in like an Ikea, I saw like a rack of rugs and I was like, maybe I need a rug.\n\n42:44.040 --> 42:49.400\nAnd then I was like, I don't know anything about rugs and kind of ran away from the...\n\n42:49.400 --> 42:51.400\nAnd I was like 25 and I was in an Ikea.\n\n42:51.400 --> 42:54.080\nThat's a time to just grab a rug, man.\n\n42:54.080 --> 43:00.600\nLike I fucking missed my life because I didn't want to buy a rug wrong.\n\n43:00.600 --> 43:02.160\nThat's fucking sick.\n\n43:02.160 --> 43:10.320\nWhat about when my mother told me that I was the only person that mattered to her and she\n\n43:10.320 --> 43:15.600\nwas coming out of a drug trip and we got through it together and we sang and cried together.\n\n43:15.600 --> 43:18.080\nOh, you wanted my shame in that?\n\n43:18.080 --> 43:19.880\nI thought you were... I was like...\n\n43:19.880 --> 43:20.880\nYou looked at me like...\n\n43:20.880 --> 43:21.880\nI know.\n\n43:21.880 --> 43:25.440\nI thought you were going to share your... And then my mom turned to me and said, I really\n\n43:25.440 --> 43:31.680\nwish that you had pursued architecture and you walked out into the front lawn and you\n\n43:31.680 --> 43:42.800\nheard a single gunshot and a church bell.\n\n43:42.800 --> 43:43.800\nThere wasn't even a church.\n\n43:43.800 --> 43:49.480\nDid I ever say on stage, I think I did say it, just the heart of man, we're like the\n\n43:49.480 --> 43:54.080\ncommunity writer's room, they remember the episode where Abed takes the class taught\n\n43:54.080 --> 43:58.400\nby the guy who's going to teach you who was the boss.\n\n43:58.400 --> 44:05.320\nAnd I think I'm not... I know I've said this publicly before, but probably not a lot.\n\n44:05.320 --> 44:13.440\nBut we had so much... Abed finishes with the guy, he beats him, he figures out who the\n\n44:13.440 --> 44:22.720\nboss was and he walks out of the class having bested his teacher and we really wanted to\n\n44:22.720 --> 44:28.000\nhave him walking across the quad and you hear bells, but then you also just hear this single\n\n44:28.000 --> 44:30.160\ngunshot.\n\n44:30.160 --> 44:35.240\nThere's a shot of Stephen Toblowski in the episode, so I have receipts for this because\n\n44:35.240 --> 44:41.440\nthere's a shot of him opening a drawer and looking at what was really happening.\n\n44:41.440 --> 44:42.440\nWe switched that out.\n\n44:42.440 --> 44:47.360\nThat was me and Chris McKenna going like, well, we got to put something in the drawer.\n\n44:47.360 --> 44:49.480\nIt was going to be a gun.\n\n44:49.480 --> 44:50.480\nAnd I think there's a gun in the drawer.\n\n44:50.480 --> 44:54.920\nI think there is a gun, but it's a joke because he pushes it and then finds the book or something.\n\n44:54.920 --> 44:58.880\nOkay, okay, he pushes the gun at it. Boy, that wouldn't even fly today.\n\n44:58.880 --> 45:03.960\nGuns aren't even funny, it's like it wouldn't even be...\n\n45:03.960 --> 45:06.440\nI think it would have been awesome.\n\n45:06.440 --> 45:10.640\nBut anyway, we were really struggling with that.\n\n45:10.640 --> 45:14.360\nYou can't... I pitched it and everyone was like, you got to do that with having Abed\n\n45:14.360 --> 45:17.720\nwalk across the quad and you just hear a single gunshot.\n\n45:17.720 --> 45:23.400\nThe important thing is Abed doesn't turn his head.\n\n45:23.400 --> 45:28.680\nHe stops and pauses and then keeps walking.\n\n45:28.680 --> 45:30.920\nDoesn't that happen though?\n\n45:30.920 --> 45:33.480\nI could be like, there's no gunshot, but doesn't he...\n\n45:33.480 --> 45:37.000\nI thought maybe I'm just misremembering, but I thought he does like there's a time where\n\n45:37.000 --> 45:39.280\nhe's walking and then he stops, but there's just...\n\n45:39.280 --> 45:40.280\nYou don't hear a gunshot.\n\n45:40.280 --> 45:41.920\nMaybe we shot it and we just didn't do the gunshot.\n\n45:41.920 --> 45:42.920\nYeah, I can't remember.\n\n45:42.920 --> 45:43.920\nOh my God. Damn.\n\n45:43.920 --> 45:44.920\nYeah, that's...\n\n45:44.920 --> 45:45.920\nYeah, my mother shot herself that night.\n\n45:45.920 --> 45:46.920\nAll right.\n\n45:46.920 --> 45:47.920\nI'm sorry.\n\n45:47.920 --> 45:48.920\nI'm sorry.\n\n45:48.920 --> 45:49.920\nSorry about that.\n\n45:49.920 --> 45:50.920\nYou know...\n\n45:50.920 --> 45:51.920\nHow can I turn that into shame?\n\n45:51.920 --> 45:55.480\nI mean, I don't have a healthy relationship with my mother.\n\n45:55.480 --> 45:56.480\nThat's easy.\n\n45:56.480 --> 45:59.200\nLike, oh, how can you take this beautiful thing and turn it into shame?\n\n45:59.200 --> 46:00.200\nThat's a fucking...\n\n46:00.200 --> 46:02.760\nYou turn it upside down.\n\n46:02.760 --> 46:03.760\nSure.\n\n46:03.760 --> 46:04.760\nSure.\n\n46:04.760 --> 46:05.760\nHow do you make this smile unhappy?\n\n46:05.760 --> 46:12.280\nLike, by being a fucking barbarian of shame, by using brute happiness inversion.\n\n46:12.280 --> 46:13.280\nVery simple.\n\n46:13.280 --> 46:14.520\nOh, you were happy?\n\n46:14.520 --> 46:16.920\nWell, I should have been.\n\n46:16.920 --> 46:17.920\nDone.\n\n46:17.920 --> 46:19.880\nOh, that rainbow's pretty.\n\n46:19.880 --> 46:21.760\nI'm not.\n\n46:21.760 --> 46:23.280\nThat's shame 101.\n\n46:23.280 --> 46:26.160\nLike, I mean, fucking...\n\n46:26.160 --> 46:30.120\nI want to say challenge me, but I'm afraid you'll challenge me and I'll look like a\n\n46:30.120 --> 46:33.720\nhorrible person because I should look like that.\n\n46:33.720 --> 46:34.720\nI'm a monster.\n\n46:34.720 --> 46:35.720\nOkay.\n\n46:35.720 --> 46:37.640\nWhat about the moon landing?\n\n46:37.640 --> 46:40.920\nI feel bad that the podcast isn't about going to the moon anymore.\n\n46:40.920 --> 46:41.920\nNice.\n\n46:41.920 --> 46:42.920\nWow.\n\n46:42.920 --> 46:43.920\nMaster.\n\n46:43.920 --> 46:45.440\nI didn't realize I threw you a lob on that one.\n\n46:45.440 --> 46:48.720\nWe had something go in there and you did what you always do, Daniel.\n\n46:48.720 --> 46:49.720\nWe did that for like...\n\n46:49.720 --> 46:50.720\nFucked it up, yeah.\n\n46:50.720 --> 46:53.880\nYou can't just leave well enough alone.\n\n46:53.880 --> 46:54.880\nYou got to overthink.\n\n46:54.880 --> 46:55.880\nYou got to change.\n\n46:55.880 --> 46:56.880\nYou got to evolve.\n\n46:56.880 --> 47:00.600\nYou're just like, you're a moving target with a gun to your head.\n\n47:00.600 --> 47:01.600\nNo one cares.\n\n47:01.600 --> 47:03.600\nStop moving.\n\n47:03.600 --> 47:06.040\nOr put the gun down.\n\n47:06.040 --> 47:12.560\nSo Gabe, what streaming media do you think that...\n\n47:12.560 --> 47:17.200\nWith no more Nielsen's, like, how will we reach the youth?\n\n47:17.200 --> 47:23.120\nOh, wait, I do have a point about that.\n\n47:23.120 --> 47:24.120\nWhoa.\n\n47:24.120 --> 47:27.840\nThe service that we're on, does anybody here have Pluto TV?\n\n47:27.840 --> 47:28.840\nPluto TV.\n\n47:28.840 --> 47:29.840\nAll right.\n\n47:29.840 --> 47:30.840\nThere we go.\n\n47:30.840 --> 47:31.840\nOne guy.\n\n47:31.840 --> 47:32.840\nOne guy who may be lying.\n\n47:32.840 --> 47:33.840\nHe's got...\n\n47:33.840 --> 47:34.840\nNo offense.\n\n47:34.840 --> 47:35.840\nIf he is...\n\n47:35.840 --> 47:36.840\nWell, anyways, continue.\n\n47:36.840 --> 47:37.840\nPlease don't.\n\n47:37.840 --> 47:38.840\nI don't...\n\n47:38.840 --> 47:43.240\nIf you're in Los Angeles or New York and you're listening to this right now, they're\n\n47:43.240 --> 47:48.720\ndoing this huge press push port of just ads everywhere and it's free TV and it's the next\n\n47:48.720 --> 47:54.520\ngeneration of entertainment and you go on it and it looks just like cable, right?\n\n47:54.520 --> 47:58.880\nYou scan through and it's got commercials and so it's like, oh, that's the system is\n\n47:58.880 --> 48:00.720\nlike commercials.\n\n48:00.720 --> 48:03.100\nIt's free TV because you've got commercials.\n\n48:03.100 --> 48:07.320\nSo I think that's the next step is like just cycling back to where we were.\n\n48:07.320 --> 48:09.240\nWe used to call that TV.\n\n48:09.240 --> 48:10.240\nRight.\n\n48:10.240 --> 48:13.320\nIt's like cycling back, yeah, to...\n\n48:13.320 --> 48:14.320\nYeah, yeah.\n\n48:14.320 --> 48:19.800\nWell, it would only be like the old days of the media providers somehow merged until\n\n48:19.800 --> 48:22.800\nthere were only three of them.\n\n48:22.800 --> 48:27.080\nThat's never going to happen because the internet...\n\n48:27.080 --> 48:28.920\nIs it all original content or is that good?\n\n48:28.920 --> 48:30.120\nNo, it's like a good mix.\n\n48:30.120 --> 48:33.840\nYou can watch like America's Most Wanted and then you can go see like an NUR2 film.\n\n48:33.840 --> 48:35.560\nThey've got like a pretty interesting...\n\n48:35.560 --> 48:40.200\nThey got like a pretty interesting layer of things and channels are like, you know, weed\n\n48:40.200 --> 48:43.000\nor slow motion or like animals or whatever.\n\n48:43.000 --> 48:44.680\nLike it's more like thematically like...\n\n48:44.680 --> 48:45.680\nSlow motion?\n\n48:45.680 --> 48:47.400\nYeah, there's a slow...\n\n48:47.400 --> 48:49.200\nIt's called slow.\n\n48:49.200 --> 48:52.600\nLike so like kind of satisfying kind of videos or...\n\n48:52.600 --> 48:55.600\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n48:55.600 --> 48:57.600\nThat's awesome.\n\n48:57.600 --> 49:03.000\nI don't work for this company.\n\n49:03.000 --> 49:06.000\nI could have pitched that way better if I...\n\n49:06.000 --> 49:10.400\nIf you look, I mean, now I either want to watch it or I'm never going to...\n\n49:10.400 --> 49:11.400\nI want to watch it.\n\n49:11.400 --> 49:12.400\nThe stakes got really high.\n\n49:12.400 --> 49:13.400\nYou were like...\n\n49:13.400 --> 49:14.400\nThe commercials are slow.\n\n49:14.400 --> 49:18.120\nYou were painted in a corner there on your advocacy of slow.\n\n49:18.120 --> 49:19.120\nIt just seems cool.\n\n49:19.120 --> 49:20.120\nI don't know.\n\n49:20.120 --> 49:21.120\nNo, it's cool.\n\n49:21.120 --> 49:22.120\nAnd they got supermarket sweepstakes.\n\n49:22.120 --> 49:23.120\nThat's good.\n\n49:23.120 --> 49:24.120\nOh, yeah?\n\n49:24.120 --> 49:25.120\nYeah, yeah.\n\n49:25.120 --> 49:26.120\nThey got good stuff.\n\n49:26.120 --> 49:27.120\nOh, so yes.\n\n49:27.120 --> 49:30.360\nSee, I went a trip to Rome with Matt Gurley on Shop to Your Drop and everyone confuses\n\n49:30.360 --> 49:31.360\nit with supermarket sweep.\n\n49:31.360 --> 49:32.360\nI'm like, no.\n\n49:32.360 --> 49:33.360\nNo, yeah.\n\n49:33.360 --> 49:34.360\nYeah, they do.\n\n49:34.360 --> 49:35.360\nShe's livid.\n\n49:35.360 --> 49:36.360\nWhat are you guessing about?\n\n49:36.360 --> 49:37.360\nShe's excited.\n\n49:37.360 --> 49:38.360\nOh, yeah.\n\n49:38.360 --> 49:39.360\nYeah.\n\n49:39.360 --> 49:40.720\nWell, you're going to love Dope State.\n\n49:40.720 --> 49:43.160\nIt's nothing like either one of them.\n\n49:43.160 --> 49:47.400\nIt was shot 20 years later.\n\n49:47.400 --> 49:50.960\nHe had both of her hands on there freaking out about Shop to Your Drop and Supermarket\n\n49:50.960 --> 49:51.960\nSweep.\n\n49:51.960 --> 49:52.960\nYeah, you were...\n\n49:52.960 --> 49:53.960\nI mean, you hit her...\n\n49:53.960 --> 49:54.960\nIt was like a one, two, two.\n\n49:54.960 --> 49:55.960\nI heard her in David.\n\n49:55.960 --> 49:56.960\nShe went, yes.\n\n49:56.960 --> 49:58.320\nAnd then that was like a step up.\n\n49:58.320 --> 49:59.320\nAnd then it was like...\n\n49:59.320 --> 50:00.320\nI got it.\n\n50:00.320 --> 50:05.560\nI mean, I got it when you said after... Yes, and they're just like, yes.\n\n50:05.560 --> 50:06.560\nRight.\n\n50:06.560 --> 50:09.000\nLike, why is he talking about both of them?\n\n50:09.000 --> 50:14.120\nBecause, I mean, it makes sense that you'd maybe be a connoisseur, right, of like shopping...\n\n50:14.120 --> 50:18.800\nThey ran back to the back so you'd watch the whole hour, right?\n\n50:18.800 --> 50:19.800\nYeah, yeah.\n\n50:19.800 --> 50:20.800\nMe and my friend...\n\n50:20.800 --> 50:21.800\nI'm going to interview you.\n\n50:21.800 --> 50:22.800\nI'm like, what's your...\n\n50:22.800 --> 50:27.800\nWhat do you like so much about shopping carts?\n\n50:27.800 --> 50:28.800\nWhat's...\n\n50:28.800 --> 50:30.800\nWhat drugs do your mom do?\n\n50:30.800 --> 50:32.800\nWhat is your mom...\n\n50:32.800 --> 50:33.800\nBring up on stage.\n\n50:33.800 --> 50:34.800\nCome up on stage, shopping person.\n\n50:34.800 --> 50:44.560\nIf you'd like to come up, you can, but you don't have to if you don't want to.\n\n50:44.560 --> 50:45.560\nDanielle, everybody.\n\n50:45.560 --> 50:47.560\nDanielle, have a seat.\n\n50:47.560 --> 50:50.560\nOh, God.\n\n50:50.560 --> 50:51.560\nYou don't have to stay up here, Danielle.\n\n50:51.560 --> 50:53.760\nI just thought it'd be funny.\n\n50:53.760 --> 50:56.880\nJeff Leans toured bringing people up.\n\n50:56.880 --> 51:00.680\nHe's like, he knows it can lead to magic.\n\n51:00.680 --> 51:03.760\nWhat show brought you here that you spent two years of your life making?\n\n51:03.760 --> 51:05.560\nHow did you earn your way to this...\n\n51:05.560 --> 51:07.880\nHow did you earn your way to this stage?\n\n51:07.880 --> 51:08.880\nOh.\n\n51:08.880 --> 51:09.880\nI hate...\n\n51:09.880 --> 51:10.880\nListen, I work...\n\n51:10.880 --> 51:11.880\nWe all get jealous.\n\n51:11.880 --> 51:15.880\nI actually work for a supermarket, so both of the shows...\n\n51:15.880 --> 51:16.880\nWhoa.\n\n51:16.880 --> 51:17.880\nDo you sweep?\n\n51:17.880 --> 51:18.880\nI sweep so hard.\n\n51:18.880 --> 51:19.880\nHell yeah.\n\n51:19.880 --> 51:20.880\nWhat's your title at the supermarket?\n\n51:20.880 --> 51:21.880\nIf I can ask.\n\n51:21.880 --> 51:22.880\nI'm a human resource manager.\n\n51:22.880 --> 51:23.880\nWhoa.\n\n51:23.880 --> 51:27.880\nYou're in charge of all the employees, whether they have...\n\n51:27.880 --> 51:28.880\nIt's HR.\n\n51:28.880 --> 51:29.880\nIt's human resources.\n\n51:29.880 --> 51:30.880\nYeah.\n\n51:30.880 --> 51:31.880\nThey have complaints.\n\n51:31.880 --> 51:32.880\nOh, I hate it.\n\n51:32.880 --> 51:36.880\nDo you have to come down on them, though, if they're not working hard enough, or do you\n\n51:36.880 --> 51:37.880\njust...\n\n51:37.880 --> 51:38.880\nYeah, you're who they send in when they get fired, right?\n\n51:38.880 --> 51:39.880\nYou're the fire person?\n\n51:39.880 --> 51:40.880\nYeah.\n\n51:40.880 --> 51:41.880\nI'm the hiring and firing person.\n\n51:41.880 --> 51:44.520\nSo I hire them and then fire them.\n\n51:44.520 --> 51:48.880\nHow do you fire someone without sucking your thumb and throwing a tantrum and...\n\n51:48.880 --> 51:52.880\nThe store manager actually does this, so I just sit there and just yes him.\n\n51:52.880 --> 51:54.880\nDo you just make sure he says it like that?\n\n51:54.880 --> 51:55.880\nYeah.\n\n51:55.880 --> 51:56.880\nThis guy knows.\n\n51:56.880 --> 51:57.880\nMake sure he's PC about it.\n\n51:57.880 --> 52:04.880\nWhen they fire someone at this establishment, is there a ritual to it?\n\n52:04.880 --> 52:05.880\nOh yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n52:05.880 --> 52:09.880\nYou have to make sure it's legit reason.\n\n52:09.880 --> 52:11.880\nRight, because they could sue, right?\n\n52:11.880 --> 52:12.880\nYes.\n\n52:12.880 --> 52:13.880\nOh yeah.\n\n52:13.880 --> 52:14.880\nThere's that...\n\n52:14.880 --> 52:15.880\nGood point, Jeff.\n\n52:15.880 --> 52:16.880\nIt's horrible.\n\n52:16.880 --> 52:17.880\nI don't know where I'm looking.\n\n52:17.880 --> 52:18.880\nSorry.\n\n52:18.880 --> 52:19.880\nNo, no, no.\n\n52:19.880 --> 52:20.880\nPeople do that all the time.\n\n52:20.880 --> 52:22.880\nThey accept it as a dynamic of the stage.\n\n52:22.880 --> 52:23.880\nIt's no one's fault.\n\n52:23.880 --> 52:24.880\nI'm just hearing things.\n\n52:24.880 --> 52:25.880\nNo, you're doing great.\n\n52:25.880 --> 52:26.880\nYou're doing great.\n\n52:26.880 --> 52:27.880\nBut it's got to be like by the...\n\n52:27.880 --> 52:31.880\nLike I was fired from Baskin Robbins, Togo's Baskin Robbins because I was taking too many\n\n52:31.880 --> 52:35.880\nsamples for myself, so I stole ice cream or whatever.\n\n52:35.880 --> 52:36.880\nYes.\n\n52:36.880 --> 52:40.880\nAnd so, like, does it ever feel like you're being pushed to like put someone in a box?\n\n52:40.880 --> 52:44.880\nLike, oh, they're not allowed to do this specific thing, so they were like doing it?\n\n52:44.880 --> 52:46.880\nLike, you know, it has to be by the book, right?\n\n52:46.880 --> 52:47.880\nDo you ever like put people in that book?\n\n52:47.880 --> 52:48.880\nNo, no, no, no.\n\n52:48.880 --> 52:49.880\nI mean, why would you admit to that?\n\n52:49.880 --> 52:50.880\nI suppose.\n\n52:50.880 --> 52:51.880\nYeah.\n\n52:51.880 --> 52:52.880\nYou know what I find interesting though?\n\n52:52.880 --> 52:57.320\nBecause like Sony would send a lawyer every year on a Sony show.\n\n52:57.320 --> 53:01.440\nThey send a lawyer to like give you a talk about like what's constitutional and what's\n\n53:01.440 --> 53:02.440\nnot and stuff.\n\n53:02.440 --> 53:05.080\nBut it's weird because it's coming from their perspective because it's like about what's\n\n53:05.080 --> 53:09.060\ngoing to protect them because you don't sue any higher than them.\n\n53:09.060 --> 53:11.440\nSo if someone sues me and then they...\n\n53:11.440 --> 53:12.440\nBut there's not...\n\n53:12.440 --> 53:13.440\nIt's not worth it, blah, blah, blah.\n\n53:13.440 --> 53:19.860\nSo Sony has this vested interest in like explaining when it's okay to fire someone and when it's\n\n53:19.860 --> 53:26.280\nnot, what I find fascinating is like of course you can't fire someone because of this whole\n\n53:26.280 --> 53:32.880\nlist of constitutionally protected attributes, but you can fire someone because you don't\n\n53:32.880 --> 53:36.320\nlike the look of their face.\n\n53:36.320 --> 53:37.320\nYou just have to specify, right?\n\n53:37.320 --> 53:39.520\nYou just have to be like, yeah, I don't like them.\n\n53:39.520 --> 53:42.360\nI don't like their personality.\n\n53:42.360 --> 53:43.360\nIsn't that true?\n\n53:43.360 --> 53:46.360\nLike you don't need like a good reason to fire someone.\n\n53:46.360 --> 53:52.200\nThere's just like a category of reasons that are illegal.\n\n53:52.200 --> 53:57.000\nWe only fire someone if they're stealing or stealing.\n\n53:57.000 --> 53:58.000\nThat's it?\n\n53:58.000 --> 53:59.760\nThat's the two things?\n\n53:59.760 --> 54:05.480\nSo if somebody's fucking on the apples, they're stealing hygiene.\n\n54:05.480 --> 54:10.280\nIf a customer complains enough, we have to let them go.\n\n54:10.280 --> 54:11.280\nSo Dan's incorrect.\n\n54:11.280 --> 54:14.480\nYou can't fire someone because you don't like the look of their face, which is based on\n\n54:14.480 --> 54:15.480\nwhat?\n\n54:15.480 --> 54:17.680\nSo where did you get that idea that that's a thing?\n\n54:17.680 --> 54:20.640\nI thought that was the message I got from Sony told you that?\n\n54:20.640 --> 54:21.640\nYeah.\n\n54:21.640 --> 54:26.400\nBecause they walk you through these scenarios where they're like, so-and-so wants to fire\n\n54:26.400 --> 54:34.160\nso-and-so, but it was sort of like, they didn't say, here's what you say if you want to fire\n\n54:34.160 --> 54:38.280\nthem, but they're kind of like, is this guy firing her for, you know, I was like, why\n\n54:38.280 --> 54:40.720\nare there genders known?\n\n54:40.720 --> 54:47.120\nThere's no women at this meeting about how to fire women.\n\n54:47.120 --> 54:50.800\nIs weed one of the things that you can fire people from if they smoke weed?\n\n54:50.800 --> 54:57.320\nSo we can't accuse someone of being intoxicated or high, but if we smell them, we can be like,\n\n54:57.320 --> 55:00.360\nhey, if they admit to it, then we can fire them.\n\n55:00.360 --> 55:03.400\nOh, I dodged a bullet.\n\n55:03.400 --> 55:07.360\nNo, but technically.\n\n55:07.360 --> 55:09.360\nTechnically bearded man with a hat.\n\n55:09.360 --> 55:11.400\nGetting mad about the weed.\n\n55:11.400 --> 55:15.880\nIf you, if the same thing as being intoxicated at work, if you are high or intoxicated and\n\n55:15.880 --> 55:17.800\nyou admit to it, then we can fire you.\n\n55:17.800 --> 55:21.120\nDo you ever, do you ever like, hey, be real with me?\n\n55:21.120 --> 55:22.120\nNo.\n\n55:22.120 --> 55:23.120\nYou know?\n\n55:23.120 --> 55:24.120\nI'm like, listen.\n\n55:24.120 --> 55:25.120\nListen, David.\n\n55:25.120 --> 55:34.840\nI'll take my HR hat off and then they're like, yeah, I did a J in the parking lot.\n\n55:34.840 --> 55:37.960\nJust to be cool and you're like, well, two things you need to know.\n\n55:37.960 --> 55:39.200\nThat's not cool.\n\n55:39.200 --> 55:42.560\nAnd the hat's always on.\n\n55:42.560 --> 55:47.680\nYou're out of here fucking pot face with your head.\n\n55:47.680 --> 55:49.840\nI don't know your drug terms.\n\n55:49.840 --> 55:55.320\nDanielle, so if someone comes in, their eyes are glassy and red and they smell like weed\n\n55:55.320 --> 56:01.960\nand you go, excuse me, are you intoxicated on the marijuana's and they go, no, man.\n\n56:01.960 --> 56:02.960\nI can't do nothing.\n\n56:02.960 --> 56:03.960\nI can't do anything.\n\n56:03.960 --> 56:04.960\nReally?\n\n56:04.960 --> 56:05.960\nThat's awesome.\n\n56:05.960 --> 56:06.960\nI love that.\n\n56:06.960 --> 56:12.880\nSo I'm here for a job at a children's museum exhibit with Sean McKenna.\n\n56:12.880 --> 56:14.200\nI don't think I've ever told this story.\n\n56:14.200 --> 56:15.200\nOh, shit.\n\n56:15.200 --> 56:16.200\nThat's why I'm excited.\n\n56:16.200 --> 56:19.400\nBecause I'm like, wow, that's one I don't think I've ever told because I'm so deeply\n\n56:19.400 --> 56:26.160\nashamed of it that I went with, you know, I'm doing improv troops and I'm just like\n\n56:26.160 --> 56:31.880\nliving the life of like, I use most of my paycheck to buy weed and then to buy gas to\n\n56:31.880 --> 56:37.240\nget to do more shows and I'm just kind of living the fucking pre-panic attack life.\n\n56:37.240 --> 56:38.240\nIt's great.\n\n56:38.240 --> 56:42.840\nDo you have it?\n\n56:42.840 --> 56:49.520\nHurry up and remember why you interrupted everyone and tell your fucking thing.\n\n56:49.520 --> 56:54.840\nMy buddy, Sean, was like, I mean, that was, I was his roommate.\n\n56:54.840 --> 56:59.600\nI lived in his attic when I was at the peak of that phase and I was like, he and I were\n\n56:59.600 --> 57:04.640\nlike in the kind of category of like, well, you can have lots of shows because you're\n\n57:04.640 --> 57:09.360\nthe only ones guaranteed to be home when we call, like everyone else is like trying to\n\n57:09.360 --> 57:11.000\nbe an adult.\n\n57:11.000 --> 57:16.360\nSo like you guys are like really dedicated to improv and in Eric what's meaning you're\n\n57:16.360 --> 57:21.480\nlike you fucking on the couch straight up and like, I think that he and I never talked\n\n57:21.480 --> 57:27.040\nabout it, but afterward, because I think we both really didn't, we didn't want to face\n\n57:27.040 --> 57:31.880\nthis, but like we, I remember we got this opportunity through some mutual friends of\n\n57:31.880 --> 57:32.880\nours.\n\n57:32.880 --> 57:36.800\nSo they're like, hey, they're adding this thing at the museum and the children's wing,\n\n57:36.800 --> 57:43.320\nlike they want to do these like fucking what's his name, boat to Bill Nye kind of things\n\n57:43.320 --> 57:47.640\nlike based on the popularity at that time of like, hey, science is cool and they want\n\n57:47.640 --> 57:51.720\nto add like live shows and do like a Beekman thing or something at this thing.\n\n57:51.720 --> 57:55.680\nAnd it was like, oh, this will be cool and they're having open auditions and me and Sean\n\n57:55.680 --> 57:56.680\nwent in.\n\n57:56.680 --> 58:00.360\nAnd we talked about it for a while and we were like, well, let's do this and that.\n\n58:00.360 --> 58:04.080\nWe came up with an audition and we went in and we're like, boy, this, I was thinking\n\n58:04.080 --> 58:08.040\nin my head like, like, you never know, you never know which of these little stepping\n\n58:08.040 --> 58:11.760\nstones is going to be the thing you look back on you go, well, I used to just play Resident\n\n58:11.760 --> 58:12.760\nEvil.\n\n58:12.760 --> 58:18.160\nAnd then like all of a sudden I bought my first tie and that you don't know what's, what's\n\n58:18.160 --> 58:19.680\nthat, what's that thing that's going to happen.\n\n58:19.680 --> 58:23.280\nAnd it just felt like it might be one of those, which makes me sound square because it makes\n\n58:23.280 --> 58:28.040\nme sound like my ambition was to get a tie and a business man like grow up.\n\n58:28.040 --> 58:32.800\nAnd I remember like, we did our thing and the, there were like four people in this like\n\n58:32.800 --> 58:38.000\nauditorium watching and I knew three of them because they're, it's like, yeah, but this\n\n58:38.000 --> 58:43.080\nis like, it's Milwaukee and, but this is how you move forward and it's like, I'm ready.\n\n58:43.080 --> 58:44.080\nLet's do this.\n\n58:44.080 --> 58:45.800\nAnd like, like, here's what I do.\n\n58:45.800 --> 58:47.720\nIt's just like, it's an audition.\n\n58:47.720 --> 58:52.400\nThere will be a script like this is our style and Sean and I played off each other and we,\n\n58:52.400 --> 58:53.400\nall right.\n\n58:53.400 --> 58:54.400\nWell, thank you.\n\n58:54.400 --> 58:55.400\nAll right.\n\n58:55.400 --> 58:56.400\nSee you later.\n\n58:56.400 --> 58:57.400\nWe went home like a day later.\n\n58:57.400 --> 59:02.080\nOne of the people that worked at the museum was like, hey, you guys, like, your audition\n\n59:02.080 --> 59:03.080\nwas great.\n\n59:03.080 --> 59:04.080\nLike they loved you guys.\n\n59:04.080 --> 59:05.080\nThat was amazing.\n\n59:05.080 --> 59:08.480\nI think you guys are so funny.\n\n59:08.480 --> 59:16.160\nYou reeked so bad of marijuana and booze, like, like it was just coming off of you.\n\n59:16.160 --> 59:22.160\nThere was just a cloud of pot and booze around you everywhere you went and everyone was\n\n59:22.160 --> 59:29.760\nlike, could smell it and was all like, how hilarious is this that they're auditioning\n\n59:29.760 --> 59:38.880\nto teach children science and they smell like a fucking child ruin her.\n\n59:38.880 --> 59:44.560\nAnd I remember Sean and I like both just laughing about it going like, I guess we did smell\n\n59:44.560 --> 59:49.440\nlike weed and that's why the system's not ready for us.\n\n59:49.440 --> 59:53.960\nBut I can't speak for him, but I died a little inside.\n\n59:53.960 --> 59:59.160\nI was like, you, that was probably your last chance ever to do anything with your life.\n\n59:59.160 --> 01:00:00.160\nAll right.\n\n01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:03.560\nAnyways, so how, all right, well, I have a question for Daniel.\n\n01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:04.560\nOkay.\n\n01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:06.800\nSo you're in the room for these firings.\n\n01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:13.160\nLike, how ugly has it gotten to do people like throw stuff and freak out and people\n\n01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:16.080\nusually just admit to it and they're like, all right, see you later.\n\n01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:17.080\nStealing.\n\n01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:18.080\nThey admit to stealing.\n\n01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:21.440\nThey're like, yeah, I did it or even don't they understand that's what you want them\n\n01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:24.440\nto do so you can get the power to fire them.\n\n01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:25.440\nYeah.\n\n01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:29.200\nAnd they don't, they don't understand the concept of like, if you admit to it, you can't\n\n01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:32.360\nclaim unemployment or do anything because you admitted to it.\n\n01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:35.800\nSo I always get the emails from the lawyers being like, Hey, why'd you fire this person?\n\n01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:40.280\nLike they admitted to stealing or they admitted to being drunk or high and they don't get\n\n01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:45.600\nlike, I don't understand why I didn't get unemployment because you admitted to just\n\n01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:46.600\ndoing all these wrong things.\n\n01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:50.040\nAre you saying I could have gotten employment from my Togo's Baskin Robbins or not?\n\n01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:51.040\nMan.\n\n01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:52.040\nYes.\n\n01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:53.040\nOnly if you were a liar.\n\n01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:54.040\nMan.\n\n01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:57.680\nYou needed to be a more dishonest person in the fiber of your being.\n\n01:00:57.680 --> 01:01:04.760\nIf you ever get called in, just deny everything and I'm best friends with my loss prevention\n\n01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:05.760\nguy.\n\n01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:08.240\nSo he always tells me like, if you ever get caught, just deny it.\n\n01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:09.240\nDamn.\n\n01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:12.080\nI feel like I'm going to be able to work with you to steal some TVs pretty soon.\n\n01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:13.080\nLet's go.\n\n01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:16.560\nThey give you a physicals for insurance.\n\n01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:23.480\nWhen you're going to be involved in a TV production and everyone is like, don't tell\n\n01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:24.480\nthem the truth.\n\n01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:32.080\nEveryone's like, they're like, it's not, I know you get the story about it.\n\n01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:34.520\nIt's like they're mad at you if you tell the truth.\n\n01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:36.000\nYou're going to cause everybody a bunch of trouble.\n\n01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:39.120\nI think that's why I never worked for that company again.\n\n01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:45.240\nLike I think I had a black mark on me for just saying, you mean to tell me, like look\n\n01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:49.880\nat our cast, nobody here has ever smoked a joint.\n\n01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:53.240\nNo one here, like come on now.\n\n01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:54.800\nIt is crazy to me.\n\n01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:56.760\nWell, that's their society.\n\n01:01:56.760 --> 01:02:00.440\nSo they just like bald face lies, what everyone knows you're lying, that just works now.\n\n01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:01.440\nIt's fine.\n\n01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:02.960\nYou didn't know you're supposed to lie?\n\n01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:05.960\nThat is really crazy to me.\n\n01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:06.960\nMaybe I've talked about this.\n\n01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:11.560\nWhen I was a big shoplifter in my college, I used to steal anything just for no reason\n\n01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:16.600\nand I stole books a lot from Barnes & Noble or another company.\n\n01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:19.080\nIt could have been any company.\n\n01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:20.080\nWalden Books.\n\n01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:21.080\nI just forget.\n\n01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:22.080\nIt was Borders.\n\n01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:23.080\nIt was Borders.\n\n01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:28.080\nBecause Borders was around when I was in college and no, it wasn't.\n\n01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:32.200\nAt any rate, a friend of mine used to work there and he said, if you steal anything,\n\n01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:36.160\neven if they think or know that you're walking out of the store with something, we are not\n\n01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:37.160\nallowed to follow you.\n\n01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:40.280\nYeah, they could call the cops and the cops don't know who you are, you're just gone.\n\n01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:41.920\nYeah, and the cops don't care.\n\n01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:45.760\nWait, you say that again.\n\n01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:51.880\nYou could pick up a stack of books off the shelf and go, taking these and walk out of\n\n01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:52.880\nthe store.\n\n01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:53.880\nThey are not allowed to come out and get you.\n\n01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:54.880\nThey can't touch you either.\n\n01:02:54.880 --> 01:02:55.880\nIt's true.\n\n01:02:55.880 --> 01:02:56.880\nYou're kidding.\n\n01:02:56.880 --> 01:02:57.880\nIt's true.\n\n01:02:57.880 --> 01:03:01.840\nThis is almost the opposite of what I was thinking would be the case, that they can't do anything\n\n01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:05.240\nto you in the store and they have to wait for you to leave at which point they'll tackle\n\n01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:06.240\nyou.\n\n01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:07.240\nI bet I learned that from a fucking movie.\n\n01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:09.240\nThey used to terrorize students.\n\n01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:15.200\nSo once you leave the store, lost prevention go out and confront you and if you say, no,\n\n01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:19.400\nthey can't touch you, they can't make you come back in the store and that's it.\n\n01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:22.680\nYou can be like, okay, I'm calling the cops and they're like, all right, see you later.\n\n01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:23.680\nThat's it.\n\n01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:24.680\nThey can't do anything.\n\n01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:29.560\nI used to, I went through a shoplifting phase when I was like 22 and I got really into going\n\n01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:35.680\nto the Gelsons in Tarzana and I would walk in and I would go to the little cookie area,\n\n01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:37.520\nlike the cookies and treats, right?\n\n01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:43.240\nI'd buy a nice tea so I bought something and then I'd go and get baguettes and sushi and\n\n01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:49.640\nbutternut squash soup and I'd put it in the bag and I'd come sit with these old war veterans\n\n01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:55.320\nthat used to hang out at the Gelsons in Tarzana at lunch and I was getting off on something,\n\n01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:56.800\nmaking up stories.\n\n01:03:56.800 --> 01:04:00.640\nI told them my name was something else and I would sit there and eat and...\n\n01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:01.640\nMy name is Jean-Claude.\n\n01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:07.480\nYeah, I was just lost in the valley and needed something in my day to do that.\n\n01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:11.280\nAnd one time they brought, and I did it for like a couple of weeks and it became like\n\n01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:17.440\na thing and then Gelsons got an undercover guy and I was sitting there eating my sushi\n\n01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:23.400\nand cops rolled up on me and arrested me in front of my war veteran friends who were like,\n\n01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:26.480\nthey picked me up and they're like, what did young Dylan do?\n\n01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:29.080\nHe served this country.\n\n01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:35.960\nIt was because I stole over $30 worth of stuff so it was an arrestable offense and they like\n\n01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:39.720\nhauled me away to the Van Nuys jail, which is like one of the worst.\n\n01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:40.720\nOh no.\n\n01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:41.720\nIt was awful.\n\n01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:46.520\nAnd I was in the cop car and I was being a little dick that the cop was like, so why\n\n01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:47.520\ndid you do this?\n\n01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:49.800\nI was like, well, you know, I thought it'd be interesting to, you know, I'm writing something\n\n01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:53.160\nright now where somebody gets arrested and, you know, I'd be interested for...\n\n01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:54.640\nJust playing that cop angle.\n\n01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:57.080\nLike, you know the cop's gonna fucking love it.\n\n01:04:57.080 --> 01:05:00.280\nOh, I got a Hollywood guy in the back seat.\n\n01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:01.680\nI love those.\n\n01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:04.960\nThat's why I became a cop.\n\n01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:09.640\nHe drops me off at Van Nuys jail and immediately I understood what the repercussions are.\n\n01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:11.680\nLike, I thought, even they didn't tell me I was going to jail.\n\n01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:15.160\nThey thought, I thought I was going to get like booked at the thing and they'd write\n\n01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:19.560\nme a thing and he drops me off at the jail and the last thing, I turn back to him and\n\n01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:22.800\nhe's like, good luck with that little research project there, buddy.\n\n01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:32.280\nAnd I'm like, does a finger get up and pass me, right in the leg and I go down and pull\n\n01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:35.560\na tourniquet together.\n\n01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:36.560\nBut it was there.\n\n01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:38.800\nThey dropped me off on a Friday.\n\n01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:43.400\nSo I'm in there and the lady at the thing is, she's like, so what, you know, and I'm\n\n01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:44.400\nlike, how long am I gonna be here?\n\n01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:48.160\nShe was like, well, it's Friday at the end of the day, so Saturday, Sunday, Monday's\n\n01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:49.400\nMartin Luther King day.\n\n01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:52.920\nSo yeah, around like probably Tuesday, Wednesday.\n\n01:05:52.920 --> 01:05:57.200\nAnd I think I started crying and then they somehow got me out.\n\n01:05:57.200 --> 01:05:58.200\nWait, what?\n\n01:05:58.200 --> 01:05:59.200\nYeah.\n\n01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:00.200\nWhat in the privilege?\n\n01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:06.640\nI mean, we now got to just say it exactly what the lady said to me.\n\n01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:07.640\nShe walked by me.\n\n01:06:07.640 --> 01:06:13.960\nI was standing at the blast, just TV and they're like sports and shit, which for my little\n\n01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:19.960\nqueer heart was like, you know, and and and she was the lady walked by.\n\n01:06:19.960 --> 01:06:24.640\nShe was like, you don't look like you belong here and she's like, what's your deal?\n\n01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:30.080\nI was like, I stole a baguette with a butternut squash with a lovely hint of lemon fresh and\n\n01:06:30.080 --> 01:06:35.360\nI don't know why I'm here and and they let and they and they let me out and I stole\n\n01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:40.080\nthe I stole the jail pants and that was the last thing I ever stole.\n\n01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:45.880\nNow my mom's a drug dealer.\n\n01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:49.560\nI want to I want to bookend that with my mom does not want people to know that she was\n\n01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:52.400\ndoing it was like nobody tell Gabe's mom okay.\n\n01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:55.080\nI'm trying to make no one find Gabe's okay.\n\n01:06:55.080 --> 01:06:59.400\nYou know it's like it's fucking like Marin County like I don't think there could be anything\n\n01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:00.400\nwrong.\n\n01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:01.400\nLike everybody's growing it.\n\n01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:02.400\nAll right.\n\n01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:03.400\nI'm okay.\n\n01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:06.400\nMarin County is like I used to go into a soup plantation and you guys are going to a soup\n\n01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:07.400\nplantation.\n\n01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:08.400\nI love it.\n\n01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:18.680\nShe had supermarket sweep energy about it.\n\n01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:19.680\nBring them up.\n\n01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:20.680\nYeah.\n\n01:07:20.680 --> 01:07:21.680\nCome on.\n\n01:07:21.680 --> 01:07:22.680\nCome on.\n\n01:07:22.680 -->

01:07:27.680\nWhat's your name?\n\n01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:28.680\nOh.\n\n01:07:28.680 --> 01:07:29.680\nOh God.\n\n01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:30.680\nIt's Nova.\n\n01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:33.160\nNova's back everybody.\n\n01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:34.160\nSoup plantation.\n\n01:07:34.160 --> 01:07:35.160\nI forgot Nova.\n\n01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:39.080\nI love a soup plantation when you go into a soup plantation if you're not hip to the\n\n01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:45.280\njive you walk in you it starts with a salad bar then at the end of that salad bar you\n\n01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:48.640\nbring your tray and your plate up to a cash register and then beyond the cash register\n\n01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:53.200\nafter you've paid it's hot items it's also it's hot stuff and cookies and brownies and\n\n01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:58.920\nsoups and plantations and yes you can grow some cotton.\n\n01:07:58.920 --> 01:08:02.480\nI didn't know that you can go back to get more salad after you've sat down and stuff.\n\n01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:03.480\nYeah.\n\n01:08:03.480 --> 01:08:04.480\nYou go back to the salad.\n\n01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:05.480\nYou have your receipt and run out.\n\n01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:06.480\nSo I was broke.\n\n01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:07.480\nI was in college.\n\n01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:10.680\nI was still in my shoplifting stealing days and like I went to USC and stole just everything\n\n01:08:10.680 --> 01:08:16.040\nand from the from the commissary there what do you call it the place with the food and\n\n01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:20.400\nwhat I would do is I'd walk in without a plate I would walk past the cash register as I didn't\n\n01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:24.280\nhave a plate and I would just say I just kind of look like I just kind of do like a point\n\n01:08:24.280 --> 01:08:26.960\nlike I'm meeting a friend or whatever like I'm not eating I'm just coming in to sit with\n\n01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:31.840\na pal or whatever and they didn't if you if you didn't have the iconic tray with the salad\n\n01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:33.880\non it they didn't care about you.\n\n01:08:33.880 --> 01:08:37.320\nSo I would just go in there and I would find a table that somebody had left and there were\n\n01:08:37.320 --> 01:08:42.080\nstill plates on and I would just sit there and read and then after five minutes I looked\n\n01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:46.440\nlike the guy they come over and they close the thing and they go hey was that iced tea\n\n01:08:46.440 --> 01:08:51.480\nI go yeah but I've had an iced tea let's get some water and they go okay yeah get a new\n\n01:08:51.480 --> 01:08:53.080\nplate walk I'll clear these for you.\n\n01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:57.960\nSlowly merge into the endless cycle that is the soup plantation lifestyle.\n\n01:08:57.960 --> 01:09:01.920\nAnd so then I would go up there and eat like crazy and then I would get started they go\n\n01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:04.680\ndo you want anything to go but we just made a fresh batch of pizzas I mean yeah and then\n\n01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:09.320\nthey'd wrap up pizza and foil so I would go there two three times a week and I kept doing\n\n01:09:09.320 --> 01:09:14.280\nit and once you get past the cash register all the servers and bus people and the people\n\n01:09:14.280 --> 01:09:19.600\nthat are serving the food and whatnot they they don't care they assume that you paid\n\n01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:21.560\nbecause you wouldn't be able to be there.\n\n01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:27.120\nI went there so often they knew my name and they would like hey Jeff what's up man we\n\n01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:31.320\njust made a batch of brownies but we already wrapped them up for you.\n\n01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:35.600\nIt's like it's like a fucking Tom Hanks movie

if I'm wrong\n\n01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:19.680\nwho cares but like some I just keep going like come on I'm so convinced in all of my predictions\n\n01:16:19.680 --> 01:16:25.120\nthat I don't want to give any of them because they're spoilers it seems like everybody feels\n\n01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:30.560\nlike there's absolutely no way Lord Tarly on the on the on the throne I'm like you mean the fat\n\n01:16:30.560 --> 01:16:38.800\nwriter character that just has everything go his way because his dad was wrong when he said\n\n01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:46.160\nyou should be less fat and you should like writing less you don't think that you have you\n\n01:16:46.160 --> 01:16:55.440\nnoticed that fucking foot pedal jamming during the fucking jazz club I was like by the way\n\n01:16:55.440 --> 01:17:02.720\nthere's a fat writer and he gets fucking everything he wants and he's always right I think the\n\n01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:08.320\nfinale of Game of Thrones is to be Lord Tarly like fucking mushing his ass like around like Megan\n\n01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:16.880\nand he's gonna like he's gonna like look at the camera and be like told you like like fucking\n\n01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:22.400\nhappy birthday fucking bullies yeah but the Game of Thrones is gonna be put back in the new\n\n01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:29.360\nlibrary what do they call that the the new library Citadel is it the Citadel it's gonna have an\n\n01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:34.720\noffice at the Citadel with the throne the sword throne yeah I mean that was my only prediction\n\n01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:39.360\nI just it's one of those things where if people are like oh he'd never do that like but if he\n\n01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:44.400\nand also I guess he's different from the Game of Thrones writers too because they're two the last\n\n01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:50.560\ntwo seasons are them just making their own show right yeah hey Dan thanks for addressing Game of\n\n01:17:50.560 -->

Thrones info desert um it's great that someone\n\n01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:07.680\nwho hasn't watched any episodes this season could create an oasis for me to uh quench my thirst\n\n01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:15.600\nit's good seriously Game of Thrones fans 69 I haven't seen it I would guess hand of the king\n\n01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:21.920\nfor him oh yeah that's my guess isn't it all just though going to be you know it's all the the\n\n01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:27.120\nfirst two were happy right I mean pretty much the first two these first two was like catch ups\n\n01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:32.080\nthese first two they were like television to me the last one was pretty pretty gloomy everybody\n\n01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:37.680\nwas like getting ready to die oh yeah and they were and they were and then and she got the thing\n\n01:18:37.680 --> 01:18:41.600\nand people were posting things of like crying like she's a knight one of the Rick and Morty\n\n01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:45.040\nwriters pointed out that because I haven't seen the episodes but they're getting together and\n\n01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:50.160\nthey're telling a lot of stories and gathering yeah and like the the overall message is like\n\n01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:56.640\nlisten when this much shit happens like you got to look back and just be like god damn no\n\n01:18:56.640 -->

also remember we moved the needle bitch\n\n01:19:10.960 --> 01:19:16.800\nit was a real wild ride baby because I liked it like someone does a monologue about storytelling\n\n01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:22.160\nI think it's fat writer isn't it it was like stories yeah you know that's the fucking thing\n\n01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:27.280\nlike history yeah I don't remember that I definitely remember the thing thinking like wow\n\n01:19:27.280 --> 01:19:31.040\nthis girl was like seven when we met her and now she's doing this that was that was weird\n\n01:19:31.680 --> 01:19:39.840\n14 same thing you clocked it huh he's like four more years up on the dial another one fictional\n\n01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:47.040\nfictional countdown clock all right it's it's it's so much more perverse the fanfic countdown clock\n\n01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:56.320\nI can't wait till the third dragon age when she has acquired the spell casting mana to control\n\n01:19:56.320 --> 01:20:01.360\nthat

no okay well I mean\n\n01:20:05.280 --> 01:20:09.360\nyou wanted to venture into this conversation even I just wanted to say this is my entirely\n\n01:20:09.360 --> 01:20:12.880\ntheory out there just in case because I just like I feel like there's a five percent chance I'm\n\n01:20:12.880 --> 01:20:18.000\nfucking nailing it that it's and I know he's definitely gonna be good like well he's gonna\n\n01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:23.200\nbe like winning whatever he's doing because it's like yeah he's like the author's insert character\n\n01:20:23.200 --> 01:20:27.200\nyeah I think he's gonna be king and then he's gonna like he's gonna sit and then he's gonna like\n\n01:20:27.200 --> 01:20:32.080\neat put his thumb in his mouth halfway you know I think you do like um I think you put I think you\n\n01:20:32.080 --> 01:20:38.560\nmake it brand and you put wheels on the on the throne whoa he's sitting down anyway big wheels\n\n01:20:38.560 --> 01:20:45.440\nmade out of swords it's Danielle right yeah a Game of Thrones fan at all predictions anything get\n\n01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:49.600\nanything off your chest you haven't had a chance to talk about Game of Thrones on this show for\n\n01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:58.000\nsix years so anything you want to say the Starks are just gonna rule all okay the Starks there you go\n\n01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:03.760\nI don't I don't that's not my prediction but I like it all right no I can't I really think\n\n01:21:03.760 --> 01:21:12.880\nthat it's spoiling so far yeah let's fight I love attacking people well what's your concern with\n\n01:21:13.520 --> 01:21:18.960\ngiving us your prediction like I truly think a lot of them are right like and so it acts as well\n\n01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:24.480\ntell us like it'll be like a bedding pool we'll get like brackets and stuff like that I don't want\n\n01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:29.440\nit I don't know I mean we me and my roommate my roommate actually I'm taking my roommate's credit\n\n01:21:29.440 --> 01:21:34.560\nCallie but you know she and me worked a lot of this out and we definitely called Gendry before\n\n01:21:34.560 --> 01:21:40.160\nthe season starting called what called Gendry and Ariad stuff and then that happened and it was great\n\n01:21:40.160 --> 01:21:44.160\nand also all the other predictions they're starting to get seeded in these two episodes and I was\n\n01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:50.240\nlike yeah they're seeding these exact games really well tell us your prediction which one well who's\n\n01:21:50.240 --> 01:21:55.360\non the throne at the end Tyrion okay yeah that's what I would say yeah that's what I was going to\n\n01:21:55.360 --> 01:21:59.760\ngo seems a little on the nose it is on the nose it's not I mean the fat writer all that's the\n\n01:21:59.760 --> 01:22:05.040\nthing but but that's it when you look at all the sign if everything's broadcast so clearly and it's\n\n01:22:05.040 --> 01:22:09.600\nalmost too obvious it's so right it will be the hands probably right that's what I said yeah okay\n\n01:22:09.600 --> 01:22:22.720\nyeah gotcha so there's one at the end John Snow knows something I miss her yeah they're\n\n01:22:22.720 --> 01:22:29.440\nmarried in real life apparently oh it's awesome that's like bad wow what a what a different\n\n01:22:29.440 --> 01:22:36.240\npodcast we're capable of I

that got an iPhone and if that sounds weird to you uh or normal to\n\n01:27:50.320 --> 01:27:54.960\nyou as anyone's guess because we don't have rules for these days like we don't we don't have any\n\n01:27:54.960 --> 01:28:00.480\nfucking old standards and so 11 year old kids got an iPhone and then uh the Rick and Morty writer\n\n01:28:00.480 --> 01:28:04.880\nwho's his uncle is getting all these texts from the 11 year old kid he just got his first phone\n\n01:28:04.880 --> 01:28:11.760\nlike I mean I was an idiot on Friendster when I was 25 because I was like what other people named\n\n01:28:11.760 --> 01:28:20.880\nDan we should form a club um the like like to be 11 and all of a sudden be able to do what\n\n01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:25.760\nfucking big people do which is stare at the fucking thing and like I don't I guess I don't have to\n\n01:28:25.760 --> 01:28:31.200\nmake a case that the kid deserves a break it's a kid but it's just like just because I remember\n\n01:28:31.200 --> 01:28:35.760\nbeing his uncle and his uncle's like and then at like 6 a.m. I'm yeah I get I get this text it's\n\n01:28:35.760 --> 01:28:44.240\nlike sup whoa so funny like I was like and he like he wrote this response about about boundaries\n\n01:28:44.240 --> 01:28:50.480\nand stuff ultimately like and I was like why wasn't Matt returning his text an option and he and he\n\n01:28:50.480 --> 01:28:56.160\nwas he was like like well I mean along and short of it was like he's like well I don't want to\n\n01:28:56.160 --> 01:29:02.480\nturn dishonest because now there's technology that makes it possible to connect with each other\n\n01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:10.400\nI have it it I just can't have like I don't want the technology to turn me into a liar it's kind\n\n01:29:10.400 --> 01:29:16.720\nof what it's like saying like like maybe I'm not always stoked to have my nephew like ask me a\n\n01:29:16.720 --> 01:29:26.400\nquestion at 730 or whatever it's so you guys how will you raise your children in this new era of\n\n01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:34.080\nnano trons and micro whams I do feel like it fucks with your brain like I don't think I would\n\n01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:38.640\nactually stop my kid from using a smartphone or like put an age limit on it but I would be pretty\n\n01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:44.160\nuncomfortable with the idea of like having that like that attention kind of thing I feel very\n\n01:29:44.160 --> 01:29:49.200\naddicted to my phone and I don't like it like do you think that kids here's just a it's just a\n\n01:29:49.200 --> 01:29:54.000\nspecifying on the question if you will like like do you think that kids what if you're raising a kid\n\n01:29:54.640 --> 01:30:02.320\nwho like kid age and it's like it's sort of like like our parents my parents uh uh uh there is like\n\n01:30:02.320 --> 01:30:07.680\noh let's go to the malt shop uh because and you're and they're like where are you going you're going\n\n01:30:07.680 --> 01:30:15.200\nto the malt shop all of that fucking that idea of control over your the development of your children\n\n01:30:15.200 --> 01:30:19.680\nlike how much freedom and how much power they have and you're hearing these story either these\n\n01:30:19.680 --> 01:30:25.360\nlike urban legends but actual stories of like she talked her friend into suicide because they\n\n01:30:25.360 --> 01:30:31.040\nwere talking every day in the text like where are we at with like this idea of like your kid like\n\n01:30:31.040 --> 01:30:36.880\nlike as a guy who has no kids and it was terrified of the idea like what's an addiction to him so\n\n01:30:36.880 --> 01:30:42.000\none of the first things I ever did was a movie about suicide and uh and I spent a bunch of time in\n\n01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:47.360\nthe uh suicide prevention community and talking about like the young brain and it's like this\n\n01:30:47.360 --> 01:30:52.240\naddiction to immediate gratification right it's like uh and and that's why the suicide rates\n\n01:30:52.240 --> 01:30:58.800\nare going up amongst younger people because there's this this addiction to like you know if I want\n\n01:30:58.800 --> 01:31:03.200\nto solve a problem I can solve it like right now if I want to contact somebody or tell somebody\n\n01:31:03.200 --> 01:31:06.640\nsomething or buy something like I'm getting right now but if I like get kicked out of my house for\n\n01:31:06.640 --> 01:31:11.120\nbeing gay or I fight with my break up with my boyfriend or girlfriend or whatever you know you\n\n01:31:11.120 --> 01:31:16.000\nwant that immediate gratification and I think that's like that Pavlovian dog response that we've gotten\n\n01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:22.160\nof like you know of of being able to wake up be or whatever yeah just immediately plus we're getting\n\n01:31:22.160 --> 01:31:26.400\ninundated with so much imagery like the average one of the statistics always blows my mind is the\n\n01:31:26.400 --> 01:31:31.440\naverage agency hardcore pornography these days is seven seven years old like that's when it was\n\n01:31:31.440 --> 01:31:36.640\nnine like of like 10 years ago the average age of look how could we let that Venice sink the average\n\n01:31:36.640 --> 01:31:46.320\nthe average age of we were once a proud lot two thousand years old the golden era I'm confused\n\n01:31:46.320 --> 01:31:51.120\ngay but the average age of doing what the average age of seeing your first hardcore porn for the first\n\n01:31:51.120 --> 01:31:55.680\ntime is like is seven oh the first I got so it was like you add that with the gratification with\n\n01:31:55.680 --> 01:32:00.000\nthe immediate gratification thing with with with all that combined it yeah I think it like yeah I\n\n01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:05.680\ndon't want kids yeah well I mean yeah I mean we all yeah we all like look at the fact that like oh\n\n01:32:05.680 --> 01:32:10.880\nit's a it's a crazy jungle and I'm just like what I'm curious about is like what you talk to any\n\n01:32:10.880 --> 01:32:16.480\nparent and it's always a different adventure like they have to make their own rules on a level that\n\n01:32:16.480 --> 01:32:21.120\nI don't think any previous generation of parent has ever I mean well probably your kids probably\n\n01:32:21.120 --> 01:32:25.200\nfucking pioneer times when you have like a saber-tooth tiger and you have to like it's that you can't\n\n01:32:25.200 --> 01:32:29.200\nyou can't just go oh I'll do whatever your family does no you get a fucking unique situation there's\n\n01:32:29.200 --> 01:32:34.080\npiranha there and there's a dinosaur there I don't know anything about history or yeah I've been\n\n01:32:34.080 --> 01:32:39.760\nthinking about this a lot lately I got really scared of technology and everything but I realized\n\n01:32:39.760 --> 01:32:46.640\nthat I was really I think I was really addicted to I went on tumblr every single day and I quit\n\n01:32:46.640 --> 01:32:52.080\ngoing on tumblr I didn't delete my account or anything because like I'll go back but it's been\n\n01:32:52.080 --> 01:32:59.680\nlike three or four days since I went on it at all and I quit because I realized it was I wasn't\n\n01:32:59.680 --> 01:33:03.920\nhaving any like I spent a lot of alone time and I spent a lot of time in my head and I realized\n\n01:33:03.920 --> 01:33:08.720\nthat instead of going to my own brain for things I was going to tumblr for things like instead of\n\n01:33:08.720 --> 01:33:14.560\ngoing for to my own self for thinking of funny things or whatever or like a comment on something\n\n01:33:14.560 --> 01:33:19.280\nI'd be like what do people on tumblr say or do about this thing or something yeah like if I got\n\n01:33:19.280 --> 01:33:23.120\ninto a tv show instead of just having all these thoughts myself I'd like search the tag on tumblr\n\n01:33:23.120 --> 01:33:29.360\nwhat did everyone else say I mean that's that's so much less shameful than the I think I like I\n\n01:33:29.360 --> 01:33:35.520\nrecognize that about Twitter I'm like and kept right on chugging like I didn't even like notice\n\n01:33:35.520 --> 01:33:40.160\nthat and been like oh that's bad I was like I think in tweets now yeah I was like that's all\n\n01:33:41.440 --> 01:33:45.920\nit was really well it was really affecting me because also people I think in general but\n\n01:33:45.920 --> 01:33:52.240\nespecially online and then especially on tumblr people talk very negatively and I really internalized\n\n01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:57.280\nthat and stuff like I got a job and then I got really sad about it because everyone talks about\n\n01:33:57.280 --> 01:34:02.160\nlike oh I have to go to work and stuff I have to get up in the morning I'm so sad but I was like\n\n01:34:02.160 --> 01:34:06.720\nI'm really happy about my job but I have like I feel like I have like other people's thoughts in my\n\n01:34:06.720 --> 01:34:11.760\nhead like oh the daily grind I have what they say about work in my head it could be siblings of years\n\n01:34:11.760 --> 01:34:16.880\nwithout even signing up for the job I think that you know each individual of them of course you\n\n01:34:16.880 --> 01:34:22.400\nwould probably predict along with me they would be like no I'm so stoked for you and all this stuff\n\n01:34:22.400 --> 01:34:29.120\nit would be like an outpouring of love but it was like that yeah the idea of it's like we yeah it's\n\n01:34:29.120 --> 01:34:34.080\ninteresting well yeah I got real friends like in real life and then they're very positive about\n\n01:34:34.080 --> 01:34:40.720\neverything you know and stuff I haven't had friends in a while but there are there are ways to you\n\n01:34:40.720 --> 01:34:46.880\nget I mean we should be proud of the fact that as like primates we are super geared towards like\n\n01:34:46.880 --> 01:34:55.200\npicking up on what I would do in this particular context to achieve praise to feel valuable to\n\n01:34:55.200 --> 01:35:00.880\nlike like any all these things that we like to regard as like oh here's the empirical human\n\n01:35:00.880 --> 01:35:07.040\nexperiences as if there's anything empirical about a fucking monkey that that thinks it's half god and\n\n01:35:07.040 --> 01:35:14.320\nlike like can't like like spinning from sentience and like running across the earth going maybe if\n\n01:35:14.320 --> 01:35:20.240\nI had an alphabet like it's psychosis so like there's nothing empirical about what we go through\n\n01:35:20.800 --> 01:35:28.400\nlike except for the fact that we are that moving planchette on the Ouija board of god's abuse\n\n01:35:28.400 --> 01:35:34.400\nall right I went a little too far too true you can't use abuse as a metaphor for a Ouija board\n\n01:35:34.400 --> 01:35:39.920\nthat's dumb and also why start with the technical french term for the pointer thing on a Ouija\n\n01:35:39.920 --> 01:35:47.520\nboard what are you a guy who watched 1987's witch board this is exactly what you said in my dream\n\n01:35:47.520 --> 01:35:55.520\nDan this is amazing there's a word word Gabe I'm doing a show how everyone's doing a show and you\n\n01:35:55.520 --> 01:36:02.800\ncome on here and you think you can be that and do this and that nothing will happen everything's\n\n01:36:02.800 --> 01:36:10.080\ngoing to happen and everything is nothing and the difference is a poor man's jewish harp\n\n01:36:11.840 --> 01:36:17.840\nplaying in the darkness in a jug band on a he-ha that's been cancelled because you're out of the\n\n01:36:17.840 --> 01:36:24.960\ndemo I'm out of the demo I'm in the demo man I'm the main demo well you will you will you can\n\n01:36:24.960 --> 01:36:33.600\nfind me because I'm high this is where I get uncarismatically high but when you're getting more high\n\n01:36:33.600 --> 01:36:37.360\nas the time passes did you hold this baseball did you panic a little bit when you were like you're\n\n01:36:37.360 --> 01:36:43.360\nlike telling the story about how you like literally you were like at jail and you were like

like I don't know what to do and like and you also said the word queer\n\n01:37:07.840 --> 01:37:13.440\nand I'm curious like were you were you projecting the image for that person of like I can't I can't\n\n01:37:13.440 --> 01:37:19.520\nspend fucking Martin Luther King weekend in prison like in jail like like and and like translated\n\n01:37:19.520 --> 01:37:24.720\ninto kind of like um sexuality terms a little bit even more so than\n\n01:37:28.560 --> 01:37:34.960\nno he's shaking his head no I mean I channel everything into sexual terms but I don't know if\n\n01:37:34.960 --> 01:37:41.520\nI don't know I don't know this is this is I don't know what you're asking oh like he's talking about\n\n01:37:41.520 --> 01:37:49.840\nthe moment when when what was the climax of it when when when telling the the story and then he\n\n01:37:49.840 --> 01:37:53.840\nsaid the word privilege where you panicked into wanting to seem like more of just a straight\n\n01:37:53.840 --> 01:38:00.640\nwhite young man who got out of jail for free like oh did I want a less like oh I'm also gay like I'm\n\n01:38:00.640 --> 01:38:05.520\nalso gay oh yeah yeah you're asking why if that's the reason why I said that well I guess that was\n\n01:38:05.520 --> 01:38:09.760\na layer of it but then I was also curious in the meantime because I was like well that's a that's\n\n01:38:09.760 --> 01:38:14.320\nyou don't you also don't have to we don't have to talk about that but also going back to that part\n\n01:38:14.320 --> 01:38:20.160\nof the story I was also curious if that wait are you asking if what you really wanted to do was call\n\n01:38:20.160 --> 01:38:24.720\nme a faggot just now when you were when you were putting me in my place and well that's not cool\n\n01:38:24.720 -->

was not connected no all right all right\n\n01:38:37.760 --> 01:38:42.240\nbecause that because that might that might I was thinking about age I was like because I was\n\n01:38:42.240 --> 01:38:48.160\nprojecting myself as when I think demo I was like you're too old but you're not too old I was\n\n01:38:48.160 --> 01:38:54.960\nthat's what that was I was not connecting I did I did leap from you're out of the demo hey can I\n\n01:38:54.960 --> 01:39:01.680\nask gay questions that is that is the core that I follow that's by the way that the main center\n\n01:39:01.680 --> 01:39:07.040\nof conversation at Starburns industries most of the time is like we'll start off in one\n\n01:39:07.040 --> 01:39:11.920\nbit of conversation and then we'll get it because I'm I identify as queer some by section I'm into\n\n01:39:11.920 --> 01:39:18.080\nboth and and it will always no matter what the it's like the dowling thing or whatever looking\n\n01:39:18.080 --> 01:39:23.200\nfor water it's like there will be like a conversation about like is nerf still putting out products\n\n01:39:23.200 --> 01:39:27.840\nand then it'll be like well that's interesting because you know with dicks and vaginas you know\n\n01:39:27.840 --> 01:39:34.320\nlike it always will lead back to that path same yeah yeah so in your very Harmon way I it was\n\n01:39:34.320 --> 01:39:38.400\nperfect because I didn't understand anything you were really saying it was completely over my head\n\n01:39:38.400 --> 01:39:46.480\nbut then it got back to dicks so you want to talk about dicks I don't I we started with balls\n\n01:39:48.240 --> 01:39:54.480\nI wait wait you once said you once said in a bar that you find a bisexuality to be the most\n\n01:39:54.480 --> 01:40:03.360\nhighly evolved of the species and I can't tell you how dare you how don't tell my millennial audience\n\n01:40:04.400 --> 01:40:10.720\nit was a brief lapse of of closed-mindedness someone said that to me about like non-binary\n\n01:40:10.720 --> 01:40:17.040\npeople like well that's like I don't say it to everyone I think some people aren't to the next\n\n01:40:17.040 --> 01:40:26.320\nstage of evolution but loss prevention I think is that's very important I yeah you ever fired someone\n\n01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:33.200\nshrinkage shrink I just oh sorry what if she's like yeah I'm a huge homophobe I don't hit a lot\n\n01:40:33.200 --> 01:40:38.880\nso my whole life I grew up with all boys I have three brothers and a dad and I always thought guys\n\n01:40:38.880 --> 01:40:44.320\ntucked their penis up when they put their pants on yeah where does it go some do\n\n01:40:44.320 --> 01:40:51.520\nyou because you're like here's how a person because it's so big I don't know I just always thought\n\n01:40:51.520 --> 01:40:56.000\nthat guys just took their penis up when they put their you see tuck it up tuck it up where\n\n01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:59.840\nlike into your waist band so just so it's not to the left or right so I could just go in the\n\n01:40:59.840 --> 01:41:04.400\nmiddle for some reason that you would like sit on it or close your legs on it so you always\n\n01:41:04.400 --> 01:41:09.280\ntucked it up some people do right was this was this based on you seeing one of your brothers do\n\n01:41:09.280 --> 01:41:16.480\nthis or something and it is the conversation like did you steal that DVD of demolition man also\n\n01:41:17.280 --> 01:41:22.240\nyou know do you like your penis yeah yeah does that have something you would not tuck that's\n\n01:41:22.240 --> 01:41:27.600\nactually the first question I have your penis in my interviews with guys I'm like how where you put\n\n01:41:27.600 --> 01:41:32.240\nyour penis I have to go to the left or right right I don't think that's not a symmetry\n\n01:41:32.240 --> 01:41:38.960\nall I had was Game of Thrones I think that's you could say faggot if you want to Dan you can\n\n01:41:38.960 --> 01:41:45.600\nlean right where does it go where does it go I need to know if the two different ways you know\n\n01:41:45.600 --> 01:41:49.600\nit's not like you're gonna be like faggot you're gonna be like faggot you know you say like you\n\n01:41:49.600 --> 01:41:53.440\nlean into the into the sassy side of it you can get away with them you have two queer people\n\n01:41:53.440 --> 01:41:59.600\ngiving you permission to say the word yeah all the way that word should be a flathead screwdriver\n\n01:41:59.600 --> 01:42:05.120\nlike that was like that that really went bring it back maybe not some people are yeah where's Dino\n\n01:42:05.120 --> 01:42:10.640\nStamatopoulos let's give him or he's in Europe I was thinking the other day about how on Twitter\n\n01:42:10.640 --> 01:42:16.160\nof like like which is while a showrunner of community technically but it wasn't like it's\n\n01:42:16.160 --> 01:42:20.560\nit's like the internet was different it was a fucking showrunner of an NBC sitcom but it's\n\n01:42:20.560 --> 01:42:26.480\nstill this was it was like I've told this story before where my brother tweeted that he was like\n\n01:42:26.480 --> 01:42:31.040\nproud of his daughter or something like that and I tweet I responded I was just like fag\n\n01:42:31.920 --> 01:42:38.880\nand it was like I'm not I'm not I am not fucking telling you that at the time that was funny it's\n\n01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:47.200\nthere was you know point in explaining that it was like for for me as an individual\n\n01:42:48.560 --> 01:42:54.800\nevident by that behavior I was in a space where I thought that was absolutely fine\n\n01:42:54.800 --> 01:42:59.920\nand and and like I remember getting kind of like like a bunch of people going like did you\n\n01:42:59.920 --> 01:43:06.800\njust call that man a fag for loving his daughter and being kind of like yeah well it wasn't even\n\n01:43:06.800 --> 01:43:13.200\nabout outrage or oppressing anyone's like when you put it that way even if we were on a desert\n\n01:43:13.200 --> 01:43:20.320\nisland I'm a bad brother that was a dumb why did I think that's funny and but not to mention the\n\n01:43:20.320 --> 01:43:25.280\nfact that then people are like it was like but I was just the reason I bring up the stories\n\n01:43:25.280 --> 01:43:30.240\nbecause I remember I was like I'm like doing something around my house and kind of daydreaming\n\n01:43:30.240 --> 01:43:36.880\nabout the internet and how it was different uh 10 years ago which is such a weird thing because\n\n01:43:36.880 --> 01:43:42.000\nthe internet's supposed to be the thing that's different about any years ago and now and then\n\n01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:48.560\nthinking back as an old man and going I remember when I didn't get fired for calling my brother a\n\n01:43:48.560 --> 01:43:57.600\nfag for loving his daughter in front of everyone then a couple people yelled at me and I said\n\n01:43:57.600 --> 01:44:05.120\nlisten I didn't mean to call my brother a fag and the fags talked it out with me and they\n\n01:44:06.080 --> 01:44:11.040\ntold me about a charity and I donated to it and that's why I'm woke\n\n01:44:11.040 --> 01:44:21.040\nthat's my story so I don't know where this deposition is going what do you mean where\n\n01:44:21.040 --> 01:44:30.320\nare the monsters they're not here I took

year did the movie mordecai come out with johnny depp oh that movie's\n\n01:53:26.960 --> 01:53:34.880\nrecently it was uh what was it like 2015 or 2014 or something and um i really liked that movie\n\n01:53:34.880 --> 01:53:40.000\nand i liked the guy in it and i looked up on google not looking for porn whatsoever just google\n\n01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:51.600\nimages just friendly safe photos i looked up blonde men with mustaches that's in my favorites\n\n01:53:53.280 --> 01:53:59.520\nbecause i was like more please and it took you to the weather man's union and i saw a porn video\n\n01:53:59.520 --> 01:54:05.440\nand i was like all right i guess today's the day i gotta gotta see porn for the first time sometime\n\n01:54:05.440 --> 01:54:13.200\nwait how old were you seven is that what you said i was probably 15 or 16 whatever year the\n\n01:54:13.200 --> 01:54:19.280\nmovie mordecai came out so i think like 16 probably i'm gonna stop asking questions because it's like\n\n01:54:19.280 --> 01:54:24.400\nit's uncharismatic now what was your i was i told his story you weren't even asking well i remember\n\n01:54:24.400 --> 01:54:28.640\nno no but i was curious about that because i was thinking about mine which i can volunteer and which\n\n01:54:28.640 --> 01:54:33.520\nwon't feel yeah what's your first penetrative old dude that can just tell you like penetrative porn\n\n01:54:33.520 --> 01:54:39.520\nnot like like like like looking at like actual yeah i remember i've i've mentioned this on the\n\n01:54:39.520 --> 01:54:46.960\npodcast before like that it was uh my dad had a box in his basement and that was playboy he had a\n\n01:54:46.960 --> 01:54:51.920\nsubscription to playboy for a year of his life and there was no hard drive there was no we didn't\n\n01:54:51.920 --> 01:54:57.200\nknow that porn was infinite so like i i i even if you got married you would just put your all your\n\n01:54:57.200 --> 01:55:02.880\nplayboys in a box and i guess and put it there there was just somehow over the years we knew\n\n01:55:03.520 --> 01:55:08.320\nyou know take 20 years you get you get like me and my brother like somehow we'd figured out like\n\n01:55:08.320 --> 01:55:14.240\nthere's like 17 magazines up on a top shelf in the basement somewhere that represent my dad's\n\n01:55:15.040 --> 01:55:23.760\nyou know carnal final final years as a subscriber to being a single guy in the form of something\n\n01:55:23.760 --> 01:55:31.760\nthat you couldn't there was no internet to look at you couldn't type in boobs um but the more but\n\n01:55:31.760 --> 01:55:39.120\nthe hardcore thing was like we would we would we would hunt for crawdad crayfish we called them\n\n01:55:39.120 --> 01:55:45.200\nin milwaukee yeah like crayfish they were like in this pond where we told this we would go we\n\n01:55:45.200 --> 01:55:52.640\nwould ride our dirt bikes up there and so it was like i want to say 10 9 or 10 and uh yeah it was\n\n01:55:52.640 --> 01:55:58.160\nlike there was like this creek and uh pond and then on the other side of these railroad tracks\n\n01:55:58.160 --> 01:56:03.680\nthere was this printing company and one of their clients was hustler and there was just this kind\n\n01:56:03.680 --> 01:56:12.240\nof general uh it's like i don't know how i don't know by what system but it was sort of like in\n\n01:56:12.240 --> 01:56:18.240\nthis weird place where you hunted for crayfish part of the magic of that area was that if you\n\n01:56:18.240 --> 01:56:24.960\nyou if you if you root it around enough you are going to eventually find like weird loose muddy pages\n\n01:56:25.680 --> 01:56:34.480\nof of cast off like misprinted pornography from the only periodical that i'm sure out of all that\n\n01:56:34.480 --> 01:56:38.240\nthat printing plant probably wasn't just it didn't say hustler on the top of the printing plant it was\n\n01:56:38.240 --> 01:56:45.040\nprobably just this chugga chugga we turn acid into paper or the vice versa kind of like plant but\n\n01:56:45.040 --> 01:56:52.000\nlike the only thing that they accomplished that made it into grubby hands that probably left\n\n01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:59.520\nand then turned into things that were amenable to the wind uh like we're that that we didn't\n\n01:56:59.520 --> 01:57:05.360\nlearn anything about cooking uh from there was it was just like you would just you'd be a fucking\n\n01:57:05.360 --> 01:57:10.800\nmuddy you're like rock and you'd lift it you're like i think i see something pull it out and it'd be\n\n01:57:10.800 --> 01:57:19.520\nthis weird like pictorial about a truck driver stopping in the diner but will you will you show\n\n01:57:19.520 --> 01:57:24.160\nme what today's specials are and like i mean like we would all huddle around it experience that's a\n\n01:57:24.160 --> 01:57:31.280\nnice like hands-on like i i i i spent some time growing up in the midwest and uh uh like tornado\n\n01:57:31.280 --> 01:57:37.360\nseason came through and ripped down um the janitors like a little shack that he had he'd like you know\n\n01:57:37.360 --> 01:57:41.280\nthe little shack and the next day i mean the whole thing didn't go down but it was like partially\n\n01:57:41.280 --> 01:57:47.200\nyou know messed up and the next day there was porn magazines all like around campus that happened\n\n01:57:47.200 --> 01:57:53.520\nto me too like hanging in a tree was the jenny mccarthy playboy one of her in the in the in the\n\n01:57:53.520 --> 01:57:58.960\nin the bathtub and i remember like a friend you know a couple friends like reaching up at it you\n\n01:57:58.960 --> 01:58:05.200\nknow like like you're reaching for it and uh and they never got polio right that sounds more rustic\n\n01:58:05.200 --> 01:58:10.720\nthan a mr. plains you can parse that information however you want my my my first heavy porn was a\n\n01:58:10.720 --> 01:58:15.120\nmagazine open mind mine was when we were on tour with the king and i i was at this point 10 years\n\n01:58:15.120 --> 01:58:20.960\nold and we were hotels every three weeks like across the country and we were like st louis\n\n01:58:20.960 --> 01:58:27.760\nor since an ad here somewhere and we like i i i found something under the bed or maybe one of\n\n01:58:27.760 --> 01:58:32.080\nthe other kids in the in the show found something under their hotel room bed and it was a porn mag\n\n01:58:32.080 --> 01:58:37.520\nof pretty hardcore stuff and it was all black people it was like an ebony kind of you know\n\n01:58:37.520 --> 01:58:45.200\nthing and it was really wild and i'd never seen yes queen i don't know i just look i try to stay\n\n01:58:45.200 --> 01:58:49.440\nrelevant all right now we just sat there we just sat there in the bed and just went through it and\n\n01:58:49.440 --> 01:58:55.440\ni'm like what what like what is that what is that what is that and like what's that white stuff and\n\n01:58:55.440 --> 01:59:00.320\nwhat the what the fuck is going on we we were like detectives trying to like reverse it like\n\n01:59:00.320 --> 01:59:04.400\ndo they like each other are they fighting what's going on is that pee or is that and if it was a\n\n01:59:04.400 --> 01:59:09.360\nhustler the answer was i don't know that's the problem i think that that's not the did you\n\n01:59:09.360 --> 01:59:14.960\ndid you guys all find the porn before you ever had the talk or after uh i can't remember the\n\n01:59:14.960 --> 01:59:20.000\ntalk i've told the story before on my podcast but i think my mom at a pretty early age and i think\n\n01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:25.280\nwith the best of intentions like did say this lying to me that i never forgot which was like\n\n01:59:25.280 --> 01:59:31.600\ndo you know how babies get made and i was like i don't know like i really don't remember how old\n\n01:59:31.600 --> 01:59:36.480\ni was when i remember my mom going like i mean mom would be like this isn't fair this retelling of\n\n01:59:36.480 --> 01:59:41.920\nthe fucking story and i now i sympathize with her now that my comedy sketch from 2009 like like\n\n01:59:41.920 --> 01:59:47.920\nmake i'm starting to realize what i've put my parents through as an adult um and the retelling\n\n01:59:47.920 --> 01:59:52.480\nof their fucking foibles when they were children having children but like i remember my mom saying\n\n01:59:52.480 --> 01:59:59.680\nlike the man's the man sees a naked lady and his and his penis stands up and starts to dance around\n\n01:59:59.680 --> 02:00:08.240\nand it shoots white stuff out of it dances around there's no contact in that story it's like a man\n\n02:00:08.240 --> 02:00:15.200\nlike sees a fucking woman and like his penis was his dad doing right i remember that was that was\n\n02:00:15.200 --> 02:00:19.840\nthe birds and bees talk that i got but and i but i do think i learned about sex from porn i mean i\n\n02:00:19.840 --> 02:00:25.520\ncould see that the grown-ups in the porn movies that we could see my dad had vhs tapes and we were\n\n02:00:25.520 --> 02:00:30.720\nseeing these hustler magazines we could see that one thing that correlates to the thing that we know\n\n02:00:30.720 --> 02:00:35.440\nthat makes boys that's like going in there like we could see it going in there but it's still\n\n02:00:35.440 --> 02:00:41.360\ncountless debates about is that pee is that where she pees like what's that stuff what's that stuff\n\n02:00:41.360 --> 02:00:45.760\nyou are actively looking for it that's the other thing is like only kid needs to google like the\n\n02:00:45.760 --> 02:00:53.040\nword boy or girl or man woman whatever and like that stuff just appears like i find it yeah i mean\n\n02:00:53.040 --> 02:00:57.760\ni think that's a whole other like mindset which is like i was i was right on the cusp i'm right at\n\n02:00:57.760 --> 02:01:03.360\nthe the age where i was still like looking at national geographics for boobies and such\n\n02:01:03.360 --> 02:01:09.120\nand hoping for a wee wee but they never had the wee wees um but like i was like i think literally\n\n02:01:09.120 --> 02:01:14.560\nlike the last generation who had right before it like crossed over and i would like actively like\n\n02:01:14.560 --> 02:01:20.160\nlook for it but if it just like it's thrown in your face well that's the whole thing right aren't\n\n02:01:20.160 --> 02:01:24.080\nwe like having sex less now that's like a thing right well i think it's but i think that's god\n\n02:01:24.080 --> 02:01:28.160\ni've read those headlines or i'm like millennials are having sex less and i'm like i know why and\n\n02:01:28.160 --> 02:01:34.160\nit ain't got nothing like like oh my god like what a fucking contract like for the rest of your life\n\n02:01:34.160 --> 02:01:39.120\nwell there's a um there's a lot of people saying which makes sense that um porn is so crazy and\n\n02:01:39.120 --> 02:01:44.400\nthere's all this stuff and then you could have it like anytime any place and so um you could see it\n\n02:01:44.400 --> 02:01:48.160\nand so then and they do you could watch like more and more hardcore stuff that maybe you'd\n\n02:01:48.160 --> 02:01:52.560\nnever get the opportunity to do in real life so you get like you know overstimulated by that so\n\n02:01:52.560 --> 02:01:56.480\nthen real sex is like boring to people there's supposedly that's the problem i'm having yeah\n\n02:01:56.480 --> 02:02:03.440\nyeah totally i i i do i do want to say that i want to offer i want to offer a counterpoint\n\n02:02:03.440 --> 02:02:10.000\nto that just because i remember being a very sexually like non-functional person and and\n\n02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:15.840\nreading that stuff and like really letting it add to my shame that what i was reading was the\n\n02:02:15.840 --> 02:02:19.680\nlike it was like the self-fulfilling prophecy of like well what do you expect all you do is jerk\n\n02:02:19.680 --> 02:02:24.640\noff all over the internet of course now you're becoming golem because you because you like\n\n02:02:24.640 --> 02:02:28.960\nwhat are you gonna do except hang out and like polish your ring in a fucking cave even though\n\n02:02:28.960 --> 02:02:34.240\nthat's the one place you don't need to be visible you eat fish all day like like you're it's like\n\n02:02:34.240 --> 02:02:40.160\nwho cares who sees you but like i have a million questions about lord of the rings but but uh but\n\n02:02:40.160 --> 02:02:44.880\ni do i do want to counter that just a little bit because remembering the amount of shame that\n\n02:02:44.880 --> 02:02:51.360\nthat made me feel and the amount of true that that wasn't necessarily i do absolutely think that\n\n02:02:51.360 --> 02:02:57.840\npeople online that are like you know i'm i'm i'm touching myself so much that like i it's a it's\n\n02:02:57.840 --> 02:03:04.320\na dysfunction and of course that's why i'm not this or that like like it just it makes me want to\n\n02:03:04.320 --> 02:03:10.400\nburst into tears thinking about that and i just want to say that like being yeah being with someone\n\n02:03:10.400 --> 02:03:18.080\nthat you can trust like feeling that you have permission to be who you are it erases everything\n\n02:03:18.080 --> 02:03:25.520\nit's not it's just it's it's it's done and done you're not damaging yourself by indulging yourself\n\n02:03:25.520 --> 02:03:30.880\nyou're not you're you're you're you're not a fucking
