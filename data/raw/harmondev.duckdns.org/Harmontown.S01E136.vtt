{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:26.000\nWelcome to the stage of the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.\n\n00:26.000 --> 00:33.000\nOn the day long ago, you were doing your thing.\n\n00:33.000 --> 00:35.000\nOh shit, I came in over here.\n\n00:35.000 --> 00:41.000\nPink, high, high, cool, Oscar night, Harmontown gonna be alright.\n\n00:41.000 --> 00:45.000\nFamily, chop, chop, chip in your chop, hip hop to the stop.\n\n00:45.000 --> 00:49.000\nFamily, Oscar night, red carpet out of sight.\n\n00:49.000 --> 00:56.000\nMy name's red carpet John.\n\n00:56.000 --> 00:59.000\nHey, I got my tuxedo on.\n\n00:59.000 --> 01:06.000\nI'm interviewing the stars.\n\n01:06.000 --> 01:08.000\nRed carpet John is a...\n\n01:08.000 --> 01:10.000\nIs he any relation to MC John who mows the lawn?\n\n01:10.000 --> 01:12.000\nOf course.\n\n01:12.000 --> 01:15.000\nIt's probably the same guy.\n\n01:15.000 --> 01:19.000\nIs he related? It's the same guy in a jacket.\n\n01:19.000 --> 01:21.000\nNow explain this to me Dan.\n\n01:21.000 --> 01:27.000\nYou go through the effort of putting on a tuxedo and you don't bother to button your clip on bow tie.\n\n01:27.000 --> 01:30.000\nIt's more about physics.\n\n01:30.000 --> 01:33.000\nIt's more about what can be done.\n\n01:33.000 --> 01:35.000\nI believe I bought this tux.\n\n01:35.000 --> 01:40.000\nThe first Oscars I actually, or Emmys or something I got to go to, I think...\n\n01:40.000 --> 01:43.000\nI fluctuate weights a little bit.\n\n01:43.000 --> 01:47.000\nYou don't know when a shirt's gonna be able to button or not.\n\n01:47.000 --> 01:49.000\nIt was the shirt. You couldn't get the shirt closed.\n\n01:49.000 --> 01:52.000\nYeah, it's actually the shirt. The bow tie actually doesn't go around anything.\n\n01:52.000 --> 01:55.000\nIt's just as you know.\n\n01:55.000 --> 01:58.000\nFamily!\n\n01:58.000 --> 02:00.000\nDid you watch anything Oscars, Harmont?\n\n02:00.000 --> 02:03.000\nYeah, we watched a little bit. I liked the opening.\n\n02:03.000 --> 02:07.000\nThe opening, you know, it's NPH so he's coming out.\n\n02:07.000 --> 02:14.000\nWe know what they're going after. They're going after the Hugh Jackman Oscars that I wrote.\n\n02:14.000 --> 02:17.000\nThey're pursuing that.\n\n02:17.000 --> 02:21.000\nWe know. I won an Emmy for writing those Oscars.\n\n02:21.000 --> 02:25.000\nLook it up.\n\n02:25.000 --> 02:30.000\nNPH is good if you can't get Hugh. Go to him.\n\n02:30.000 --> 02:32.000\nDid you see the opening?\n\n02:32.000 --> 02:33.000\nI did not.\n\n02:33.000 --> 02:37.000\nIt was a nice... I don't know, if you can watch it.\n\n02:37.000 --> 02:39.000\nDid he do a song and dance?\n\n02:39.000 --> 02:43.000\nYeah, he just did a straight up song. He had humorous elements.\n\n02:43.000 --> 02:53.000\nIt was a nice... It was both sincere and totally respectful of the modern world.\n\n02:53.000 --> 03:01.000\nYou felt... It did a good job of making it feel like you were watching something worth watching live.\n\n03:01.000 --> 03:05.000\nAs we increasingly start to ask the question, why are we watching this shit?\n\n03:05.000 --> 03:08.000\nI thought it was an opener that really answered that question.\n\n03:08.000 --> 03:10.000\nLike, check it out. This is nice.\n\n03:10.000 --> 03:13.000\nDougie's doing his thing.\n\n03:13.000 --> 03:18.000\nThey did special effects that blended the live action with the thing.\n\n03:18.000 --> 03:24.000\nIn a huge kind of fuck you to Billy Crystal, they just did a kind of like...\n\n03:24.000 --> 03:30.000\nJust a little quick thrown over the shoulder, like a little visual montage of him sitting in little things.\n\n03:30.000 --> 03:34.000\nIt wasn't a fuck you, I'm just saying. It was less is more.\n\n03:34.000 --> 03:38.000\nIt was really nice, like interplay with animation on the screen and stuff.\n\n03:38.000 --> 03:41.000\nAt the end of it, everyone liked it, and I said...\n\n03:41.000 --> 03:46.000\nI said, eh, there's no standing ovation.\n\n03:46.000 --> 03:48.000\nDid you get a standing ovation?\n\n03:48.000 --> 03:51.000\nYes.\n\n03:51.000 --> 03:55.000\nAnd by hue, I mean you.\n\n03:55.000 --> 03:59.000\nI thought you said you, and I had no problem with it.\n\n03:59.000 --> 04:03.000\nYour ears filtered out the hood part of that.\n\n04:03.000 --> 04:05.000\nOld you, Jackman.\n\n04:05.000 --> 04:08.000\nI looked at my phone later.\n\n04:08.000 --> 04:13.000\nI didn't hear my phone beep when it beeped when I saw what time the timestamp was,\n\n04:13.000 --> 04:15.000\nand it was as that thing ended.\n\n04:15.000 --> 04:23.000\nAnd it was a text from Rob Schrab that said, hm, no standing o.\n\n04:23.000 --> 04:28.000\nIt's nice to know we're still keeping it real.\n\n04:28.000 --> 04:31.000\nThat's the 81st Oscars. Let's see what I got in here, huh?\n\n04:31.000 --> 04:35.000\nAll right, so what's the deal with Oscar Knight?\n\n04:35.000 --> 04:38.000\nI mean, what is it? Some kind of gala?\n\n04:38.000 --> 04:40.000\nNo.\n\n04:40.000 --> 04:44.000\nIt just says hm, no standing o in my notes, that's it.\n\n04:44.000 --> 04:47.000\nI don't know what I thought was going to be in there, the Gettysburg Address.\n\n04:47.000 --> 04:51.000\nAh, it seems like we hold some truths to be self-evident, not the Gettysburg Address.\n\n04:51.000 --> 04:55.000\nWhen you were at your Oscars, how many Oscars was that ago?\n\n04:55.000 --> 04:58.000\nThose are the 81st, so it's got to be six years ago now.\n\n04:58.000 --> 05:00.000\nDid you watch it from the wings or were you out in the crowd?\n\n05:00.000 --> 05:03.000\nWe were watching it, I think I've told this story a lot.\n\n05:03.000 --> 05:10.000\nWe were watching from a tiny old-school CRT television backstage,\n\n05:10.000 --> 05:15.000\nand it was awesome because we were in these shitty rented tuxes\n\n05:15.000 --> 05:17.000\nbecause we didn't have time to go home,\n\n05:17.000 --> 05:21.000\nand they have this tux kind of service for all.\n\n05:21.000 --> 05:24.000\nThere's so much crew that works on that show, so everyone's working really hard,\n\n05:24.000 --> 05:29.000\nand you get a number and you go up to this wardrobe floor\n\n05:29.000 --> 05:33.000\nand they just give you a tux for the night if you're a crew.\n\n05:33.000 --> 05:37.000\nSo we had these laminates on, we had these shitty baggy tuxes on,\n\n05:37.000 --> 05:41.000\nand we were just watching from this walking closet on this little television screen,\n\n05:41.000 --> 05:43.000\nwatching Hugh Jackman go through the thing,\n\n05:43.000 --> 05:48.000\nand I swear I broke a bone in my foot from jumping up and down because he was nailing it.\n\n05:48.000 --> 05:52.000\nIt's not a good story, it's just a really fun time in my life.\n\n05:52.000 --> 05:57.000\nOnce in a while, Ben Schwartz, now it seems funny that he was one of the three musketeers\n\n05:57.000 --> 06:01.000\nbecause now he's like a famous actor on Parks and Rec,\n\n06:01.000 --> 06:07.000\nand of course House of Lies with Don Cheadle.\n\n06:07.000 --> 06:09.000\nIs that the name of that show?\n\n06:09.000 --> 06:16.000\nEvery once in a while, he'll email a photo of Bruce Valanche sleeping in a corner or something.\n\n06:16.000 --> 06:18.000\nThen we took it from back then.\n\n06:18.000 --> 06:23.000\nWe were just kids, we didn't know what we were doing, and Hollywood loved us for it.\n\n06:23.000 --> 06:26.000\nJeff, I could go on with my Hollywood stories.\n\n06:26.000 --> 06:28.000\nStop me if I haven't, I probably have.\n\n06:28.000 --> 06:31.000\nI told you my story about the one time I went, right, when I met that crazy lady?\n\n06:31.000 --> 06:34.000\nYeah, yeah, a crazy lady picked you up at a bar like Midnight Cowboy.\n\n06:34.000 --> 06:37.000\nNo, no, at the hair salon.\n\n06:37.000 --> 06:40.000\nAnd then she proceeded, yeah, I have told those stories.\n\n06:40.000 --> 06:42.000\nShe was a crazy lady and you had to like bail out of the cab.\n\n06:42.000 --> 06:44.000\nYeah, it was bad.\n\n06:44.000 --> 06:50.000\nIt was very clear at like hour three that she had had pills and then the booze was like combining\n\n06:50.000 --> 06:53.000\nand she halked out.\n\n06:53.000 --> 06:56.000\nDo you remember why she was there?\n\n06:56.000 --> 07:01.000\nShe had previously been nominated for art department or something like that.\n\n07:01.000 --> 07:03.000\nOr like art set design or something like that.\n\n07:03.000 --> 07:05.000\nThat must be a weird haunted life to lead.\n\n07:05.000 --> 07:07.000\nDo you really just get to go if you win anything?\n\n07:07.000 --> 07:12.000\nLike if you drew Shrek's balls, do you just keep going to the Oscars every year?\n\n07:12.000 --> 07:15.000\nI think if you've been nominated, you're allowed to go.\n\n07:15.000 --> 07:18.000\nBut we were sitting way up top, like you're not down on the main floor.\n\n07:18.000 --> 07:21.000\nBecause even just watching it, even just having touched it a little bit, I got it.\n\n07:21.000 --> 07:28.000\nI mean, I don't know if it's jealousy or just like what it is, but it's definitely like, there's a haunted feeling.\n\n07:28.000 --> 07:30.000\nI want to be back there at the Kodak.\n\n07:30.000 --> 07:34.000\nThe smell of grease paint.\n\n07:34.000 --> 07:36.000\nHere's what I want to know.\n\n07:36.000 --> 07:41.000\nOkay, so a couple of years ago, so some of you kids are young enough that you were around,\n\n07:41.000 --> 07:46.000\nlike you probably don't remember that they would do the in memoriam at the Oscars.\n\n07:46.000 --> 07:54.000\nAnd there was a time before they told everybody, don't clap for each one.\n\n07:54.000 --> 07:57.000\nEspecially don't clap for your favorites.\n\n07:57.000 --> 07:59.000\nBecause they're all dead.\n\n07:59.000 --> 08:01.000\nSee, so it's starting to get weird.\n\n08:01.000 --> 08:04.000\nBut it was like forever, that was just the tradition.\n\n08:04.000 --> 08:10.000\nThey would just show people, you know, and then Ernest Borknine would come up and there would be like an applause break.\n\n08:10.000 --> 08:15.000\nAnd then they'd fly through three like, Timothy the Bone Man, Key Grip or whatever.\n\n08:15.000 --> 08:18.000\nFuck you.\n\n08:18.000 --> 08:22.000\nDid you Key Grip for Ernest Borknine? Because I don't give a fuck.\n\n08:22.000 --> 08:25.000\nAnd then like these, you know, these rousing applause.\n\n08:25.000 --> 08:27.000\nBut so they did away with that.\n\n08:27.000 --> 08:30.000\nProbably a good move, great cultural advancement that we made.\n\n08:30.000 --> 08:36.000\nI don't know about the, and the Oscar goes to as opposed to end the winner as that seems a little empty as far as like correctness.\n\n08:36.000 --> 08:45.000\nBut I do think that we evolved when someone said, let's tell him don't applaud after all the death.\n\n08:45.000 --> 08:48.000\nHowever, now it's even weirder.\n\n08:48.000 --> 08:51.000\nYou got these faces come up.\n\n08:51.000 --> 08:57.000\nAnd you know, totally, you kind of like brace yourself for Robin Williams because he's the headliner death.\n\n08:57.000 --> 08:59.000\nAnd you're like, are they going to save him for last?\n\n08:59.000 --> 09:00.000\nHow does this work?\n\n09:00.000 --> 09:02.000\nWe're always asking these morbid questions, aren't we, during these things?\n\n09:02.000 --> 09:06.000\nBecause you're blending two worlds that don't belong.\n\n09:06.000 --> 09:11.000\nPresentation, entertainment and the inevitability of the corporeal world.\n\n09:11.000 --> 09:14.000\nYeah, where do you put Robin in that?\n\n09:14.000 --> 09:17.000\nThey put, I imagine they went alphabetically or I don't know what they did.\n\n09:17.000 --> 09:19.000\nI actually don't.\n\n09:19.000 --> 09:26.000\nChronologically, in order of death.\n\n09:26.000 --> 09:28.000\nHow did you know that?\n\n09:28.000 --> 09:31.000\nMike Nichols was last.\n\n09:31.000 --> 09:33.000\nOkay, all right.\n\n09:33.000 --> 09:35.000\nTwo points to terminal line, okay.\n\n09:35.000 --> 09:39.000\nBut okay, so when you're watching, Mike Nichols learned by colleague.\n\n09:39.000 --> 09:43.000\nI don't know if we say this every year, but it was a tragic year.\n\n09:43.000 --> 09:49.000\nTragic in terms of the amount of fame that died.\n\n09:49.000 --> 09:57.000\nIt's hard to honor the famous dead without feeling weird because you're like, what am I rooting for?\n\n09:57.000 --> 09:59.000\nI didn't know them.\n\n09:59.000 --> 10:06.000\nSo people were silent, there was no like, okay, well Robin Williams, okay, great.\n\n10:06.000 --> 10:11.000\nBut for three or four people, there's always like this weird sound.\n\n10:11.000 --> 10:16.000\nYou hear like this sound, come on up in a second, let me finish my point.\n\n10:16.000 --> 10:23.000\nYou hear like this, it'll say Mike Nichols and then you'll just hear like two or three people,\n\n10:23.000 --> 10:27.000\nlike somewhere in the back of the house.\n\n10:27.000 --> 10:30.000\nSo we know that that's not like Mrs. Nichols,\n\n10:30.000 --> 10:37.000\nbecause no one's going to express their connection to the death with applause.\n\n10:37.000 --> 10:43.000\nAnd we also know it's therefore a human being that knows that they're breaking rank.\n\n10:43.000 --> 10:47.000\nSo it was just like the world's biggest psycho Mike Nichols fan?\n\n10:47.000 --> 10:48.000\nYeah.\n\n10:48.000 --> 10:50.000\nLike fuck these other dead people!\n\n10:50.000 --> 10:52.000\nYou go, Mike Day!\n\n10:52.000 --> 10:54.000\nWho are these, it's so weird.\n\n10:54.000 --> 10:57.000\nI would say somebody who's A, a huge Mike Nichols fan,\n\n10:57.000 --> 11:00.000\nB, somebody who doesn't like the no applause rule.\n\n11:00.000 --> 11:03.000\nLike they're like, no, I'm allowed to applaud Mike Nichols,\n\n11:03.000 --> 11:05.000\nbecause he wrote The Graduate or whatever.\n\n11:05.000 --> 11:07.000\nRight, it's like some kind of weird career path.\n\n11:07.000 --> 11:11.000\nThere's writers in the audience like applauding or something for Billy Wilder, I don't know.\n\n11:11.000 --> 11:12.000\nI don't know.\n\n11:12.000 --> 11:13.000\nI don't know.\n\n11:13.000 --> 11:14.000\nI don't know.\n\n11:14.000 --> 11:15.000\nI don't know.\n\n11:15.000 --> 11:16.000\nI don't know.\n\n11:18.000 --> 11:22.000\nAre you a little on weed that you're not invited back this year that you're not?\n\n11:22.000 --> 11:23.000\nNo.\n\n11:23.000 --> 11:28.000\nLook, when I was at the Oscars, I was a lowly Kepler elf backstage.\n\n11:28.000 --> 11:29.000\nI was honored to do my duty.\n\n11:29.000 --> 11:33.000\nI wrote a little bit of pattern for Jack Black and Jennifer Aniston,\n\n11:33.000 --> 11:35.000\nand I wrote that Emmy-winning opening.\n\n11:37.000 --> 11:38.000\nThank you.\n\n11:38.000 --> 11:39.000\nThanks.\n\n11:39.000 --> 11:42.000\nIf you want to look it up, I won an Emmy for writing the Oscars,\n\n11:42.000 --> 11:44.000\nwhich is kind of cool.\n\n11:44.000 --> 11:47.000\nCan you sing a little bit of it for us?\n\n11:47.000 --> 11:49.000\nYou remember your favorite line from it?\n\n11:49.000 --> 11:53.000\nEverything is awesome.\n\n11:53.000 --> 11:55.000\nI can't remember.\n\n11:55.000 --> 11:58.000\nThe Lonely Island guys were on stage tonight at the Oscars.\n\n11:58.000 --> 12:00.000\nJack Black was in the opening.\n\n12:00.000 --> 12:03.000\nHe Kanye'd the NPH opening.\n\n12:03.000 --> 12:04.000\nIt was kind of fun.\n\n12:04.000 --> 12:07.000\nHe did like a sort of pseudo Jack Black rap.\n\n12:07.000 --> 12:08.000\nIt was fun.\n\n12:08.000 --> 12:11.000\nI was wondering if they wrote that for Kanye,\n\n12:11.000 --> 12:14.000\nand then got Jack to do it, and Jack said, I can't rap.\n\n12:14.000 --> 12:16.000\nAnd then they're like, well, kind of sing rap.\n\n12:16.000 --> 12:20.000\nIf you watch it, I feel like we're kind of hoping that Kanye could come\n\n12:20.000 --> 12:22.000\nand just watch it.\n\n12:22.000 --> 12:25.000\nAnd we were in line in the rain, Dan.\n\n12:25.000 --> 12:28.000\nWe weren't late.\n\n12:28.000 --> 12:36.000\nSpeaking of memoriam, it feels like weird to not mention that our friend,\n\n12:36.000 --> 12:43.000\na friend of so many of us, Harris Wittels, is lost now.\n\n12:43.000 --> 12:50.000\nIt couldn't have been a more tragic passing, totally very much just tragic,\n\n12:50.000 --> 12:52.000\njust accidental.\n\n12:52.000 --> 13:00.000\nAnd I would like to take one moment to say to people who every time,\n\n13:00.000 --> 13:04.000\nwhen somebody's death involves a car,\n\n13:04.000 --> 13:10.000\nyou don't divert your attention away from who the person was\n\n13:10.000 --> 13:13.000\nand whether you respect them or not,\n\n13:13.000 --> 13:17.000\nor whether you'll miss them to spend a lot of time about automobile statistics\n\n13:17.000 --> 13:19.000\nand the industry and insurance and stuff.\n\n13:19.000 --> 13:21.000\nAnd here's a number you can call.\n\n13:21.000 --> 13:23.000\nMake sure you're insured.\n\n13:23.000 --> 13:26.000\nLeave it the fuck alone.\n\n13:26.000 --> 13:29.000\nEverybody takes cars everywhere every day.\n\n13:29.000 --> 13:32.000\nCars kill all kinds of people.\n\n13:32.000 --> 13:34.000\nWriters do heroin, cocaine.\n\n13:34.000 --> 13:35.000\nThey drink.\n\n13:35.000 --> 13:38.000\nPeople have different addictions and struggles.\n\n13:38.000 --> 13:41.000\nThey are, in addition to that, human beings.\n\n13:41.000 --> 13:48.000\nIf you don't know the person and they died in a way that is symbolic for you politically,\n\n13:48.000 --> 13:56.000\nthink for a second before you leave that Instagram caption or that tweet.\n\n13:56.000 --> 14:00.000\nIt's not your time to work some shit out.\n\n14:00.000 --> 14:03.000\nIt's just a guy that died.\n\n14:03.000 --> 14:13.000\nIt's no more cool on God's part to kill somebody through a horrible pressing addiction\n\n14:13.000 --> 14:18.000\nthan it is to kill them with an anvil or cancer or anything.\n\n14:18.000 --> 14:22.000\nIt is all part of this big shitty world that we are all united in.\n\n14:22.000 --> 14:34.000\nAnd Harris was, if you go online and you're going to see how incredibly tragic it is\n\n14:34.000 --> 14:37.000\nthat he would be taken from us at such a young age.\n\n14:37.000 --> 14:42.000\nAnd he was not irresponsible and he did not make bad choices.\n\n14:42.000 --> 14:49.000\nAnd he was very smart and very self-aware and just very, very, very funny and very,\n\n14:49.000 --> 14:52.000\nlike, just a good guy.\n\n14:52.000 --> 14:55.000\nAnd he just had a bad accident and now he's gone.\n\n14:55.000 --> 14:57.000\nAnd this is the way that life is.\n\n14:57.000 --> 15:03.000\nAnd so, I retweeted an article that was a really nice,\n\n15:03.000 --> 15:12.000\ntrying to find the words of who was he, why was he so cool and why did we not notice.\n\n15:12.000 --> 15:15.000\nWhat labels to put it on, how to describe him.\n\n15:15.000 --> 15:20.000\nThat's one of the nice things about this new podcast universe is you can just type in his name\n\n15:20.000 --> 15:25.000\nand you can go find him on so many podcasts telling really amazing stories\n\n15:25.000 --> 15:30.000\nabout struggling with his addiction, for instance, about all kinds of things.\n\n15:30.000 --> 15:38.000\nHe was a linchpin of this community and so many of us are just really, really shaken by this one.\n\n15:38.000 --> 15:42.000\nIt's a tough one and you want that bargaining phase to be,\n\n15:42.000 --> 15:45.000\nokay, so let's all make up our minds, call your sponsor,\n\n15:45.000 --> 15:48.000\nput this bumper sticker on your thing and wear this ribbon.\n\n15:48.000 --> 15:53.000\nThat's just bargaining and it's as healthy as denial and it's,\n\n15:53.000 --> 15:57.000\nbut ultimately acceptance is the only thing that's going to be honest.\n\n15:57.000 --> 16:00.000\nLike, who gives a fuck how they died?\n\n16:00.000 --> 16:05.000\nIt's not important, it's not who they were and it's not,\n\n16:05.000 --> 16:08.000\nthere's no such thing as a deserved death or anything like that.\n\n16:08.000 --> 16:14.000\nJust like, notice how cool the guy was, go listen to his stories.\n\n16:14.000 --> 16:16.000\nHe was an old soul, I guess.\n\n16:16.000 --> 16:18.000\nI had no idea he was that young, really.\n\n16:18.000 --> 16:22.000\nThat was a horrible way to find out that somebody was 30 years old.\n\n16:22.000 --> 16:23.000\nI didn't know either.\n\n16:23.000 --> 16:28.000\nHe was just a kid when he started to work on the Sarah Silverman show after I left.\n\n16:28.000 --> 16:34.000\nHe kind of arrived there as I left to sort of fill that vacuum\n\n16:34.000 --> 16:39.000\nand he was literally a child and was just like,\n\n16:39.000 --> 16:43.000\nyou can't swing a cat in the city without finding somebody\n\n16:43.000 --> 16:49.000\nthat has a good story about him and now it's all laced with this stuff\n\n16:49.000 --> 16:53.000\nand there's nothing to do but grieve and accept it.\n\n16:53.000 --> 16:55.000\nSports Corner!\n\n16:55.000 --> 16:57.000\nNo, I'm kidding, there's no sports corner.\n\n16:57.000 --> 17:06.000\nI do fight, yeah, okay.\n\n17:06.000 --> 17:27.000\nSo, let's bring out Dino Stamatopoulos, who I haven't seen since he...\n\n17:27.000 --> 17:33.000\nI just want to say that I actually met Harris here once\n\n17:33.000 --> 17:42.000\nand we kind of shared a moment and I can't believe he's gone humble brag.\n\n17:42.000 --> 17:47.000\nThere's a lot of humble bragging going on in the wake of his passing.\n\n17:47.000 --> 17:52.000\nYou see this, I fucking peed in my pants.\n\n17:52.000 --> 17:54.000\nWhat do you mean? Tell us about it.\n\n17:54.000 --> 18:00.000\nWell, I got here and I had to pee really bad and the guy out there, he was really nice.\n\n18:00.000 --> 18:03.000\nI was like, Dan's already out there. Oh, he's out there?\n\n18:03.000 --> 18:09.000\nI don't know for some reason I felt like you ran a tight ship.\n\n18:09.000 --> 18:13.000\nWhat's he talking about himself? He'll need me any second.\n\n18:13.000 --> 18:18.000\nSo, yeah, I went and I took a piss and I zipped up too soon.\n\n18:18.000 --> 18:21.000\nI was still peeing.\n\n18:21.000 --> 18:23.000\nIt's a fucking nightmare.\n\n18:23.000 --> 18:25.000\nSo, not really peeing your pants.\n\n18:25.000 --> 18:27.000\nNo, I actually peed in my pants.\n\n18:27.000 --> 18:29.000\nYou peed on them.\n\n18:29.000 --> 18:32.000\nOh, you said you just had more pee to do and then you zipped up your pants and you just kept peeing.\n\n18:32.000 --> 18:34.000\nI just zipped them up and I kept going.\n\n18:34.000 --> 18:35.000\nIt was stupid.\n\n18:35.000 --> 18:36.000\nI don't know if I've ever done that.\n\n18:36.000 --> 18:41.000\nThey say that no matter how you shake or dance, the last drop is always in your pants.\n\n18:41.000 --> 18:45.000\nThat sounds like something MC John would say.\n\n18:45.000 --> 18:48.000\nWell, keys to the parrots and the parrots to the keys.\n\n18:48.000 --> 18:53.000\nSo, I just said at Little Dom's and they put my drink to go.\n\n18:53.000 --> 18:55.000\nOh, that's nice. Welcome back. I haven't seen you.\n\n18:55.000 --> 18:57.000\nThis is the only way we can get together.\n\n18:57.000 --> 19:00.000\nI know. I know you're working a lot and I'm just drunk.\n\n19:00.000 --> 19:01.000\nYeah.\n\n19:01.000 --> 19:03.000\nYou're traveling?\n\n19:03.000 --> 19:05.000\nYou've been back for a couple of weeks now and I haven't seen you at all.\n\n19:05.000 --> 19:10.000\nYeah, you go off traveling the world, Canada and Canada and Canada.\n\n19:10.000 --> 19:12.000\nI was in Canada.\n\n19:12.000 --> 19:14.000\nYou were in New York working for Smigal.\n\n19:14.000 --> 19:15.000\nYeah, yeah.\n\n19:15.000 --> 19:17.000\nOn the insult comic doc show.\n\n19:17.000 --> 19:18.000\nInsult comic doc show.\n\n19:18.000 --> 19:19.000\nIs that what it's called?\n\n19:19.000 --> 19:22.000\nYeah.\n\n19:22.000 --> 19:26.000\nIt needs work, but I think it'll be okay.\n\n19:26.000 --> 19:30.000\nSo, what's, compare him to me vertically?\n\n19:30.000 --> 19:34.000\nHierarchically, in terms of talent.\n\n19:34.000 --> 19:41.000\nHe, I could sneak out easier out of his show than your show.\n\n19:41.000 --> 19:45.000\nSo, he's more talented.\n\n19:45.000 --> 19:47.000\nHe doesn't notice you're gone.\n\n19:47.000 --> 19:49.000\nYeah, he doesn't notice I'm gone.\n\n19:49.000 --> 19:50.000\nAre you sad to be back?\n\n19:50.000 --> 19:52.000\nBecause you were living the high life out there, man.\n\n19:52.000 --> 19:53.000\nYeah, I mean, it was ridiculous.\n\n19:53.000 --> 19:56.000\nThere was a Dino out there and tell me if I'm wrong.\n\n19:56.000 --> 19:58.000\nYou would work a little bit at the office.\n\n19:58.000 --> 20:00.000\nThen you would take your work away to the office.\n\n20:00.000 --> 20:01.000\nI barely at the office.\n\n20:01.000 --> 20:03.000\nI was like, you know, I can't really work here.\n\n20:03.000 --> 20:06.000\nI like working at a bar.\n\n20:06.000 --> 20:08.000\nAnd they're like, yeah, whatever works for you.\n\n20:08.000 --> 20:11.000\nAnd, you know, I would just get drunk and right.\n\n20:11.000 --> 20:13.000\nAnd then you would go eat French food.\n\n20:13.000 --> 20:18.000\nYeah, and go eat French food and funk boys and girls.\n\n20:18.000 --> 20:20.000\nBecause you were fucking everybody out there.\n\n20:20.000 --> 20:25.000\nYeah, it turns out that everyone in fucking New York is beautiful,\n\n20:25.000 --> 20:27.000\nincluding me apparently.\n\n20:27.000 --> 20:29.000\nWho would have known?\n\n20:29.000 --> 20:30.000\nIt was ridiculous.\n\n20:30.000 --> 20:32.000\nSo just being in the city made you extra sexy?\n\n20:32.000 --> 20:34.000\nYeah, I don't know how.\n\n20:34.000 --> 20:37.000\nI think people go out there because they want to have an adventure.\n\n20:37.000 --> 20:39.000\nThey want to like, I want to fuck things up.\n\n20:39.000 --> 20:44.000\nI want to, you know, deal with ugliness and shit.\n\n20:44.000 --> 20:47.000\nAnd then there I am.\n\n20:47.000 --> 20:50.000\nTrousers soaked in your own urine.\n\n20:50.000 --> 20:51.000\nYeah, urine.\n\n20:51.000 --> 20:53.000\nI mean, this is not going to go away tonight.\n\n20:53.000 --> 20:54.000\nThere's that much?\n\n20:54.000 --> 20:55.000\nI can't see it.\n\n20:55.000 --> 20:56.000\nTake a look at this.\n\n20:56.000 --> 20:57.000\nYou see it?\n\n20:57.000 --> 20:58.000\nYou can see it from there.\n\n20:58.000 --> 21:01.000\nYou're wearing kind of pea colored pants almost.\n\n21:01.000 --> 21:05.000\nNo, these were white before I got here.\n\n21:05.000 --> 21:06.000\nWow.\n\n21:06.000 --> 21:08.000\nThat's a lot of pee.\n\n21:08.000 --> 21:12.000\nYou got to subscribe to the live feed for stuff like that.\n\n21:12.000 --> 21:13.000\nYou really do.\n\n21:13.000 --> 21:17.000\nI'm going to take the cap off because this scotch is too hot.\n\n21:17.000 --> 21:22.000\nIf you did not subscribe to the live feed, you're really missing out on a pee stain right now.\n\n21:22.000 --> 21:26.000\nHow have you guys been doing?\n\n21:26.000 --> 21:27.000\nI've been doing good.\n\n21:27.000 --> 21:29.000\nIt's really hard to write community this year.\n\n21:29.000 --> 21:30.000\nIt's like...\n\n21:30.000 --> 21:32.000\nYou're doing it for the fans.\n\n21:32.000 --> 21:34.000\nYou don't really want to write it.\n\n21:34.000 --> 21:35.000\nSeriously.\n\n21:35.000 --> 21:36.000\nAdmit it.\n\n21:36.000 --> 21:37.000\nI...\n\n21:37.000 --> 21:39.000\nAdmit it.\n\n21:39.000 --> 21:40.000\nNo.\n\n21:40.000 --> 21:42.000\nYou really don't want to write it.\n\n21:42.000 --> 21:44.000\nYou want to do it for the people?\n\n21:44.000 --> 21:45.000\nThat's admirable.\n\n21:45.000 --> 21:52.000\nI will admit that I'm not 100% sure I did it for my own joy.\n\n21:52.000 --> 21:56.000\nBut the last thing I'm going to do is lay it on the fucking fans doorstep.\n\n21:56.000 --> 21:59.000\nThey're watching season six and they're like, this sucks.\n\n21:59.000 --> 22:01.000\nAnd then there's a foot and I was like, Dan says it's your fault.\n\n22:01.000 --> 22:03.000\nThat's not what I was saying.\n\n22:03.000 --> 22:07.000\nI'm saying that you want to do it.\n\n22:07.000 --> 22:08.000\nYou want to do it for your family.\n\n22:08.000 --> 22:12.000\nGod knows what...\n\n22:12.000 --> 22:13.000\nI do feel...\n\n22:13.000 --> 22:17.000\nThe other thing is you're listening to my running commentary while I'm in the process here.\n\n22:17.000 --> 22:19.000\nSo don't...\n\n22:19.000 --> 22:24.000\nJust feel this in the moment with me because I never know what the fuck I'm talking about.\n\n22:24.000 --> 22:28.000\nBut right now I feel like I am doing a horrible job.\n\n22:28.000 --> 22:31.000\nA couple weeks ago I was like, I'm a god.\n\n22:31.000 --> 22:32.000\nI did it.\n\n22:32.000 --> 22:33.000\nAnd then a couple weeks before that.\n\n22:33.000 --> 22:35.000\nAnd I swear it goes because it just depends on...\n\n22:35.000 --> 22:37.000\nI'll see a cut and I'll be like, oh, it's working.\n\n22:37.000 --> 22:38.000\nOkay.\n\n22:38.000 --> 22:40.000\nThat's how God works.\n\n22:40.000 --> 22:41.000\nThat's why they're tsunamis.\n\n22:41.000 --> 22:43.000\nI fucked up.\n\n22:46.000 --> 22:49.000\nWait, he fucks up and then does a tsunami to...\n\n22:49.000 --> 22:51.000\nI don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.\n\n22:51.000 --> 22:55.000\nI was just happy I turned and you were laughing.\n\n22:55.000 --> 22:57.000\nAnd then God goes like, oh, fucking god damn it.\n\n22:57.000 --> 23:00.000\nI made too many people again.\n\n23:00.000 --> 23:02.000\nTsunami time.\n\n23:02.000 --> 23:03.000\nI definitely just feel...\n\n23:03.000 --> 23:04.000\nI feel the burn.\n\n23:04.000 --> 23:07.000\nIt feels like doing a crunch.\n\n23:07.000 --> 23:11.000\nI just feel like for better or for worse, I'm working.\n\n23:11.000 --> 23:16.000\nI feel like we need to do a telethon for the fans and say lay off him.\n\n23:16.000 --> 23:19.000\nLet him not work on community for a while.\n\n23:19.000 --> 23:22.000\nI think this is a problem that solves itself.\n\n23:22.000 --> 23:25.000\nIf it's a bad season, then it will kind of go away.\n\n23:25.000 --> 23:29.000\nBut I think that it's just...\n\n23:29.000 --> 23:33.000\nI think if you did anything for six years, the sixth year would be like Jesus Christ.\n\n23:33.000 --> 23:36.000\nAm I in the zone?\n\n23:36.000 --> 23:40.000\nThree of the first seven characters are gone.\n\n23:40.000 --> 23:44.000\nWhat am I doing with the remaining four and what am I doing with the new two?\n\n23:44.000 --> 23:46.000\nAm I servicing them?\n\n23:46.000 --> 23:48.000\nAm I exploring them?\n\n23:48.000 --> 23:50.000\nCan it ever really...\n\n23:50.000 --> 23:53.000\nI try to psych myself out and sell myself.\n\n23:53.000 --> 23:55.000\nIt's just a new show.\n\n23:55.000 --> 23:57.000\nI just dimensionalize the characters.\n\n23:57.000 --> 24:00.000\nIs that my job or am I supposed to just be telling jokes?\n\n24:00.000 --> 24:03.000\nAnd I don't know what I'm doing.\n\n24:03.000 --> 24:06.000\nAnd then I'll watch a cut and I'll be like...\n\n24:06.000 --> 24:08.000\nOn Tuesday, I'll be like, I did it.\n\n24:08.000 --> 24:10.000\nIt's the best season ever.\n\n24:10.000 --> 24:12.000\nCan't believe it's on the internet instead of TV.\n\n24:12.000 --> 24:13.000\nThat's the way you do it.\n\n24:13.000 --> 24:15.000\nAnd then on Wednesday, I'm like, I fucked up.\n\n24:15.000 --> 24:17.000\nI did it real bad.\n\n24:17.000 --> 24:20.000\nI don't want to go home.\n\n24:20.000 -->

to...\n\n49:06.000 --> 49:12.000\nJoni Foster.\n\n49:12.000 --> 49:14.000\nI think we did that wrong, right?\n\n49:14.000 --> 49:16.000\nThat was great.\n\n49:16.000 --> 49:18.000\nAnd if I didn't establish this earlier,\n\n49:18.000 --> 49:20.000\nthey don't know who I'm going to say.\n\n49:20.000 --> 49:22.000\nAnd also they don't know who Charlie Callas is.\n\n49:22.000 --> 49:25.000\nAll right.\n\n49:25.000 --> 49:27.000\nHere we go.\n\n49:27.000 --> 49:30.000\nYou saw it was a very outgoing Charlie Callas.\n\n49:30.000 --> 49:32.000\nPlease welcome to the stage,\n\n49:32.000 --> 49:38.000\nyou know him from filling in that smaller crater.\n\n49:38.000 --> 49:43.000\nAnd you know her as president of the dark side of the moon,\n\n49:43.000 --> 49:53.000\nAlec Baldwin and Oprah Winfrey.\n\n49:53.000 --> 50:00.000\nThey will be presenting best.\n\n50:00.000 --> 50:04.000\nThough they need no activity because we respect their power,\n\n50:04.000 --> 50:08.000\nthey will be presenting a best original song.\n\n50:08.000 --> 50:13.000\nYou know they say that the song is the heart and soul of a movie.\n\n50:13.000 --> 50:15.000\nAnd without a song,\n\n50:15.000 --> 50:18.000\nthat the movie's not really the whole experience that it ought to be.\n\n50:18.000 --> 50:25.000\nThat's the worst Oprah Winfrey ever.\n\n50:25.000 --> 50:27.000\nI stole this joke.\n\n50:27.000 --> 50:41.000\nI was going to say hello, I'm Oprah Winfrey.\n\n50:41.000 --> 50:47.000\nI got so depressed that I stole this joke I peed on my pants.\n\n50:47.000 --> 50:53.000\nThe nominees are...\n\n50:53.000 --> 50:58.000\nAll right.\n\n50:58.000 --> 51:02.000\nLater in the night, Drew Barrymore and Dakota Fanning\n\n51:02.000 --> 51:11.000\npresented the Oscar for best original screenplay.\n\n51:11.000 --> 51:13.000\nI get to do the easy one.\n\n51:13.000 --> 51:15.000\nThat's the worst.\n\n51:15.000 --> 51:19.000\nSorry, go ahead.\n\n51:19.000 --> 51:25.000\nThe thing of Kate Hudson's impression of Drew Barrymore is what I'm doing right now.\n\n51:25.000 --> 51:27.000\nAnd is magical.\n\n51:27.000 --> 51:31.000\nHello, I'm Dakota Fanning.\n\n51:31.000 --> 51:33.000\nWhat's the top, what's the nomination again?\n\n51:33.000 --> 51:35.000\nWhat's the category?\n\n51:35.000 --> 51:36.000\nOriginal Screenplay.\n\n51:36.000 --> 51:38.000\nWell shit, original screenplays.\n\n51:38.000 --> 51:48.000\nI'm Dakota Fanning.\n\n51:48.000 --> 51:50.000\nIt's the name, it's the name.\n\n51:50.000 --> 51:54.000\nI don't know what that is, it sounds like an old time cowboy actor.\n\n51:54.000 --> 51:57.000\nOh shit, I'm Dakota Fanning.\n\n51:57.000 --> 52:01.000\nAnd the Oscar goes to Everybody.\n\n52:01.000 --> 52:05.000\nFinally, the night took a dramatic turn\n\n52:05.000 --> 52:11.000\nin a moment that will be forever remembered in Oscar history as the time it happened.\n\n52:11.000 --> 52:17.000\nWhen Billy Crystal and Benedict Cumberbatch presented best picture.\n\n52:17.000 --> 52:23.000\nCome on, Billy Crystal's dead by then, right?\n\n52:23.000 --> 52:24.000\nHe's gotta be.\n\n52:24.000 --> 52:25.000\nOh no, I thought not.\n\n52:25.000 --> 52:28.000\nNo, I picture him like a future on a head in a jar.\n\n52:28.000 --> 52:30.000\nOh really, okay.\n\n52:30.000 --> 52:46.000\nHey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.\n\n52:46.000 --> 52:49.000\nThat is the worst Oprah Winfrey I've ever heard.\n\n52:49.000 --> 52:53.000\nYay, and that was presenters.\n\n52:53.000 --> 53:00.000\nAll right, that was a good segment.\n\n53:00.000 --> 53:02.000\nAll right, that was dynamite.\n\n53:02.000 --> 53:03.000\nThat was fun, thanks.\n\n53:03.000 --> 53:05.000\nThank you for that.\n\n53:05.000 --> 53:13.000\nI just want to show everybody my opposite of a beautiful mind notes for.\n\n53:13.000 --> 53:17.000\nAll right, let's make sure, is it Lana?\n\n53:17.000 --> 53:18.000\nLana.\n\n53:18.000 --> 53:19.000\nIs it land?\n\n53:19.000 --> 53:22.000\nHe might have thought it was Lana.\n\n53:22.000 --> 53:24.000\nBecause we know Lana, we know Lana.\n\n53:24.000 --> 53:26.000\nIs Lana spelled differently from Lana?\n\n53:26.000 --> 53:29.000\nNo, no, Lana was just.\n\n53:29.000 --> 53:31.000\nDo you correct people?\n\n53:31.000 --> 53:35.000\nSometimes, if it seems like they're going to be saying my name a lot.\n\n53:35.000 --> 53:37.000\nLana is really the way you say it.\n\n53:37.000 --> 53:42.000\nLana, that bitch was out of her mind.\n\n53:42.000 --> 53:43.000\nShe's the worst.\n\n53:43.000 --> 53:47.000\nYeah, she was just the worst.\n\n53:47.000 --> 53:50.000\nI kind of feel like there's a thing happening with Dino and Lana right now.\n\n53:50.000 --> 53:52.000\nI feel like it's happening.\n\n53:52.000 --> 53:53.000\nOh yeah.\n\n53:53.000 --> 53:54.000\nWell, don't kill it.\n\n53:54.000 --> 53:56.000\nI don't think it can be killed.\n\n53:56.000 --> 53:58.000\nI think that Dino's sexuality is.\n\n53:58.000 --> 54:01.000\nI'm going to whisper sweet nothing's in here right now.\n\n54:01.000 --> 54:06.000\nNigger.\n\n54:06.000 --> 54:10.000\nIt's my catchphrase, people.\n\n54:10.000 --> 54:11.000\nMan.\n\n54:11.000 --> 54:14.000\nIt always works.\n\n54:14.000 --> 54:20.000\nIt's such a hard R.\n\n54:20.000 --> 54:21.000\nAll right.\n\n54:21.000 --> 54:26.000\nWell, Lana, Lana, what do you think?\n\n54:26.000 --> 54:27.000\nWhat do I think?\n\n54:27.000 --> 54:28.000\nOh boy.\n\n54:28.000 --> 54:31.000\nYou got a new book coming out?\n\n54:31.000 --> 54:32.000\nDick pics.\n\n54:32.000 --> 54:36.000\nI'm trying to figure out a way to put a ribbon on it, not the dick.\n\n54:36.000 --> 54:40.000\nLana, I see you've come here with a gentleman tonight.\n\n54:40.000 --> 54:41.000\nAre you guys involved?\n\n54:41.000 --> 54:42.000\nNo.\n\n54:42.000 --> 54:44.000\nNo, no.\n\n54:44.000 --> 54:45.000\nHe's here visiting from Texas.\n\n54:45.000 --> 54:46.000\nOh, say no more.\n\n54:46.000 --> 54:48.000\nIf you want to sleep with him.\n\n54:48.000 --> 54:49.000\nIt's cool.\n\n54:49.000 --> 54:50.000\nI can fuck him.\n\n54:50.000 --> 54:51.000\nOkay, good, good.\n\n54:51.000 --> 54:52.000\nI mean, as long as he's okay with that.\n\n54:52.000 --> 54:53.000\nHe's okay with it.\n\n54:53.000 --> 54:54.000\nAs long as he's okay with that.\n\n54:54.000 --> 54:55.000\nI just want to make sure the girl.\n\n54:55.000 --> 54:57.000\nHe won't know what hit him, believe me.\n\n54:57.000 --> 55:02.000\nDo you think the threesome guy, was he supposed to also have sex with you?\n\n55:02.000 --> 55:05.000\nOr was he supposed to just have sex with the woman alongside you?\n\n55:05.000 --> 55:09.000\nI was probably going to like lick his come off or something like that.\n\n55:09.000 --> 55:10.000\nI mean, if you're into it.\n\n55:10.000 --> 55:11.000\nOh, fuck it.\n\n55:11.000 --> 55:12.000\nIf you're into it.\n\n55:12.000 --> 55:15.000\nYou guys are prejudiced.\n\n55:15.000 --> 55:17.000\nThey didn't booze the n-bomb as hard as that.\n\n55:17.000 --> 55:18.000\nYeah.\n\n55:18.000 --> 55:22.000\nYeah, that's exactly what I was thinking.\n\n55:22.000 --> 55:28.000\nThere's got to be at least one African-American Harmon John fan here tonight that's just like,\n\n55:28.000 --> 55:29.000\nwait a minute.\n\n55:29.000 --> 55:32.000\nYeah, I think I actually lost one.\n\n55:32.000 --> 55:38.000\nI'm going to go home and like ask myself a lot of questions about society.\n\n55:38.000 --> 55:41.000\nI would lick his come

wasn't lovely and thank you for having me.\n\n55:49.000 --> 55:50.000\nIt's so boring.\n\n55:50.000 --> 55:55.000\nI used to ask when I was in high school and thought I was clever, would ask all the guys\n\n55:55.000 --> 55:58.000\nthat I knew how they thought of their penis.\n\n55:58.000 --> 56:01.000\nWas it a tool, a trophy, or a toy?\n\n56:01.000 --> 56:02.000\nTrophy.\n\n56:02.000 --> 56:03.000\nAnd it was an interesting kind of poll.\n\n56:03.000 --> 56:04.000\nA tool, a trophy.\n\n56:04.000 --> 56:06.000\nWell, Dan, you said you said you're just practical.\n\n56:06.000 --> 56:09.000\nSo I'm going to go with tool with yours.\n\n56:09.000 --> 56:10.000\nOr a toy.\n\n56:10.000 --> 56:11.000\nA toy.\n\n56:11.000 --> 56:19.000\nWell, I mean, it's a toy until you get married and then it's a tool, right?\n\n56:19.000 --> 56:26.000\nBa-ba-ba-ba-ba.\n\n56:26.000 --> 56:27.000\nIt's a totem.\n\n56:27.000 --> 56:28.000\nA totem.\n\n56:28.000 --> 56:29.000\nA totem was a...\n\n56:29.000 --> 56:30.000\nWhat is the...\n\n56:30.000 --> 56:32.000\nIt was a tool, a trophy, or a...\n\n56:32.000 --> 56:33.000\nOkay, yeah, yeah.\n\n56:33.000 --> 56:34.000\nYeah, it's all G words.\n\n56:34.000 --> 56:36.000\nI'm trying to figure out how it could ever be a trophy.\n\n56:36.000 --> 56:39.000\nBut like, I guess if it was really big?\n\n56:39.000 --> 56:40.000\nYeah.\n\n56:40.000 --> 56:41.000\nLike...\n\n56:41.000 --> 56:42.000\nIt doesn't have to be big.\n\n56:42.000 --> 56:45.000\nBecause how do you win a dick?\n\n56:45.000 --> 56:46.000\nCome over here.\n\n56:46.000 --> 56:47.000\nOh, God.\n\n56:47.000 --> 56:48.000\nWhat did you say?\n\n56:48.000 --> 56:49.000\nI said, come over here.\n\n56:49.000 --> 56:50.000\nI'll show you.\n\n56:50.000 --> 56:51.000\nYou wrap it in like gold ribbon.\n\n56:51.000 --> 56:52.000\nThat's right.\n\n56:52.000 --> 56:53.000\nRight.\n\n56:53.000 --> 56:54.000\nBut it's your own.\n\n56:54.000 --> 56:59.000\nI mean, I understand how someone else could win it.\n\n56:59.000 --> 57:07.000\nI consider all of my wieners collaborators to be winners in some way.\n\n57:07.000 --> 57:11.000\nI hope they're not feeling like they lost something.\n\n57:11.000 --> 57:18.000\nBut I took the trophy with me and also, never mind, I...\n\n57:18.000 --> 57:19.000\nI mean, would you have...\n\n57:19.000 --> 57:20.000\nI love my dick.\n\n57:20.000 --> 57:21.000\nWould you have...\n\n57:21.000 --> 57:22.000\nWould you have...\n\n57:22.000 --> 57:23.000\nOh, what are you asking me?\n\n57:23.000 --> 57:24.000\nWould you have licked the...\n\n57:24.000 --> 57:25.000\nCome off it.\n\n57:25.000 --> 57:27.000\nYeah, it doesn't matter to me.\n\n57:27.000 --> 57:29.000\nIt's all...\n\n57:29.000 --> 57:31.000\nWe're all, you know, one organism.\n\n57:31.000 --> 57:33.000\nWe're all made of stars.\n\n57:33.000 --> 57:35.000\nAll made of stars.\n\n57:35.000 --> 57:36.000\nYeah.\n\n57:36.000 --> 57:37.000\nAll right.\n\n57:37.000 --> 57:41.000\nWell, any parting thoughts if you want...\n\n57:41.000 --> 57:43.000\nNo, that puts you on the spot.\n\n57:43.000 --> 57:46.000\nI'm always feeling like I don't want to deprive people of their moment.\n\n57:46.000 --> 57:48.000\nYou could just leave if you want.\n\n57:48.000 --> 57:50.000\nLet's have a hand.\n\n57:50.000 --> 57:51.000\nYeah!\n\n57:51.000 --> 57:52.000\nLana!\n\n57:52.000 --> 58:02.000\nI don't have any final thoughts either.\n\n58:02.000 --> 58:05.000\nYeah, the...\n\n58:05.000 --> 58:10.000\nI'm bad at interviewing and I'm bad at figuring out when to...\n\n58:10.000 --> 58:11.000\nHow do you say...\n\n58:11.000 --> 58:12.000\nI think you're good.\n\n58:12.000 --> 58:13.000\nYou're a nice guy.\n\n58:13.000 --> 58:14.000\nHow do you say just...\n\n58:14.000 --> 58:15.000\nI don't want to...\n\n58:15.000 --> 58:16.000\nI didn't want her to leave.\n\n58:16.000 --> 58:18.000\nYou thank them and you say...\n\n58:18.000 --> 58:19.000\nNo, she was fine.\n\n58:19.000 --> 58:20.000\nShe was fine.\n\n58:20.000 --> 58:26.000\nI always feel like the Wisconsin in me wants to be ironic about it.\n\n58:26.000 --> 58:28.000\nI don't want to just like...\n\n58:28.000 --> 58:30.000\nI don't want to be like Craig Kilborn.\n\n58:30.000 --> 58:32.000\nI feel perfectly respected.\n\n58:32.000 --> 58:33.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n58:33.000 --> 58:34.000\nNo, I wasn't worried about you, lady.\n\n58:34.000 --> 58:35.000\nNo.\n\n58:35.000 --> 58:36.000\nNo, no.\n\n58:36.000 --> 58:38.000\nI wasn't...\n\n58:38.000 --> 58:41.000\nIt's just a spineless thing.\n\n58:41.000 --> 58:42.000\nI don't want to take charge.\n\n58:42.000 --> 58:44.000\nI don't want to be like...\n\n58:44.000 --> 58:49.000\nI don't like the idea of me coming across as having the pretense\n\n58:49.000 --> 58:51.000\nthat the show has any direction at all.\n\n58:51.000 --> 58:52.000\nI don't...\n\n58:52.000 --> 58:53.000\nThat's what it is.\n\n58:53.000 --> 58:54.000\nLike, okay, let's keep it going.\n\n58:54.000 --> 58:55.000\nCome on.\n\n58:55.000 --> 58:58.000\nLet's thank her as if we have better stuff to do.\n\n58:58.000 --> 59:02.000\nI don't need you guys to talk right now, either.\n\n59:02.000 --> 59:03.000\nYeah.\n\n59:03.000 --> 59:06.000\nWell, that's so funny.\n\n59:06.000 --> 59:09.000\nWell, not so spineless anymore.\n\n59:09.000 --> 59:12.000\nDan, do you think it's because you're wearing a tux\n\n59:12.000 --> 59:15.000\nthat you feel like now there's suddenly a structure to the show?\n\n59:15.000 --> 59:16.000\nNo, no, no, no.\n\n59:16.000 --> 59:19.000\nThis is a... I'm expressing a thing.\n\n59:19.000 --> 59:22.000\nI'm open sourcing my experience as I do the show for years.\n\n59:22.000 --> 59:23.000\nI've always done this.\n\n59:23.000 --> 59:25.000\nI've always had trouble at the end of...\n\n59:25.000 --> 59:27.000\nIs this your first fight?\n\n59:27.000 --> 59:28.000\nOf people.\n\n59:28.000 --> 59:30.000\nLike, whether it's Greg Proops or anybody,\n\n59:30.000 --> 59:32.000\nI never know if I'm supposed to go like,\n\n59:32.000 --> 59:34.000\nokay, thank him for coming.\n\n59:34.000 --> 59:37.000\nIt just feels like such an odd thing to be the person that says,\n\n59:37.000 --> 59:38.000\nall right, this phone call's over.\n\n59:38.000 --> 59:40.000\nIt's just a lot of power to...\n\n59:40.000 --> 59:43.000\nRight, but it's not me, and it's a gift.\n\n59:43.000 --> 59:46.000\nAs opposed to putting somebody on the spot and saying,\n\n59:46.000 --> 59:48.000\nlike, you need to prove that you're...\n\n59:48.000 --> 59:49.000\nNo, yeah, I get that now.\n\n59:49.000 --> 59:50.000\nI'm working through this.\n\n59:50.000 --> 59:51.000\nI get that.\n\n59:51.000 --> 59:52.000\nHe doesn't need you to talk, lady.\n\n59:52.000 --> 59:53.000\nYeah.\n\n59:53.000 --> 59:55.000\nBut if you just had a stroke and you're like,\n\n59:55.000 --> 59:56.000\nwho are you?\n\n59:56.000 --> 59:57.000\nWhat do you wear?\n\n59:57.000 --> 59:58.000\nWhat's going on?\n\n59:58.000 --> 59:59.000\nCome, come, come.\n\n59:59.000 --> 01:00:00.000\nGo, go, go.\n\n01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:01.000\nChicken, chicken, chicken.\n\n01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.000\nGrease.\n\n01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:08.000\nThat didn't get a big laugh, but I liked it.\n\n01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000\nI just play that song.\n\n01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000\nI got it in my head.\n\n01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.000\nIt's a good song, right?\n\n01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:16.000\nYeah.\n\n01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.000\nWhat's this guy's name again?\n\n01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:18.000\nKevin MacLeod.\n\n01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000\nIt's all this free online stuff that I just found a bunch of\n\n01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:21.000\nin a rush to get some music to play,\n\n01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000\nand I think we've got to make this guy famous.\n\n01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000\nSee, it's always on the wrong...\n\n01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:34.000\nLet's do it from the top.\n\n01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.000\nFrom the top.\n\n01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:36.000\nYou ready, Dan?\n\n01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.000\nOkay.\n\n01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.000\nIs this a real craving?\n\n01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000\nDan, I want you to sing less like you're about to die.\n\n01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000\nYeah.\n\n01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:20.000\nWhat up, motherfucker?\n\n01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000\nWe don't know what's up.\n\n01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:27.000\nI will fuck you up for money!\n\n01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:28.000\nI'm a hire killer.\n\n01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000\nI've got a knife in my shoe.\n\n01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:34.000\nCha!\n\n01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000\nKingsman sucked.\n\n01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000\nSome shitty movie.\n\n01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:43.000\nThat movie sucked, and if you liked it, you're a sociopath.\n\n01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:50.000\nIt was a toxically pee-wrapped film about nothing at all.\n\n01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:55.000\nBeep, beep, choo-ka-choo, 42, can't go to movies.\n\n01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000\nAnymore, kids been sucked out the door.\n\n01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:03.000\nStupid, knife-foot lady, just headbangs, doesn't have a character.\n\n01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:08.000\nSam Jackson had a list, it's a choice.\n\n01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000\nHe's an actor, really embarrassing to sit through.\n\n01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000\nThat movie was fucked up, man.\n\n01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000\nThat movie was so fucked up.\n\n01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000\nIt would be out of breath for a couple of weeks.\n\n01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000\nThat song was called Sidewalk Out of Sight.\n\n01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:30.000\nEven with all that irony, I still feel old.\n\n01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000\nI just don't understand anything.\n\n01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:34.000\nJust because I'm so groovy?\n\n01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000\nYou're thinking, why are these kids here, why do they pay $10?\n\n01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.000\nYeah, why do they care about you?\n\n01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.000\nI mean, I like you, you're a nice guy.\n\n01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.000\nBut what the fuck?\n\n01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.000\nWhat's everyone here for?\n\n01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:50.000\nTonight's not the night that it's evident why.\n\n01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000\nIt's more of a long-term relationship you have, I think.\n\n01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:58.000\nLike, you know, look at it like, do we have the night off, maybe?\n\n01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:01.000\nFamily?\n\n01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:04.000\nIt's a bad movie.\n\n01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:08.000\nIt's a movie about dressing nice, I guess, and having knives for feet.\n\n01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000\nIt's a left-wing critique of spy movies.\n\n01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000\nA left-wing critique of spy movies.\n\n01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:18.000\nWhat is the biggest anarcho-capitalist person to decide to save the world\n\n01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:20.000\nby only allowing a lead to having all the court-\n\n01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:22.000\nBring him up.\n\n01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:24.000\nFuck you!\n\n01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.000\nGreat, come here!\n\n01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:28.000\nCome here!\n\n01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:33.000\nIf you want to come up and do a three-minute endorsement of Kingsman,\n\n01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:38.000\nI just found it to be a profoundly toxic piece of garbage.\n\n01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:40.000\nI agree.\n\n01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:45.000\nBut it's clearly controversial and here's why, because it's childish nonsense\n\n01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000\nand then every time they make a movie that includes childish nonsense,\n\n01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000\nif there's a dinosaur or a robot in it, or a lady with knife feet,\n\n01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:53.000\nor it's based on a comic book, which is everything now,\n\n01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:57.000\nthen we all feel like it's religion and we all have to argue about it.\n\n01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:02.000\nAll of a sudden, it's important whether you have the, if you're the Jew that has the curly thingies\n\n01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000\nor whether you have the special hat, or both.\n\n01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:10.000\nIt becomes high stakes when nerds encounter each other in the over-cigarettes in the alley\n\n01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:12.000\nabout the fucking movie that came out.\n\n01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:18.000\nIt's important to know for us, is this a good thing or a bad thing?\n\n01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:20.000\nI'm 42, it's a whole different topic for me.\n\n01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:22.000\nIt's just like these movies are just getting dumber and dumber.\n\n01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:26.000\nI'm telling you, I'm sorry, I just didn't like Guardians of the Galaxy.\n\n01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000\nI'm so bored, I'm so tired.\n\n01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:33.000\nI just play Minecraft and I just go to sleep.\n\n01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:39.000\nI think that movies are for just people who, it's the third movie you've seen,\n\n01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000\nand if it's a third movie you've seen, then it's good, you know?\n\n01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:44.000\nThe third movie I saw was like Die Hard.\n\n01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:48.000\nI think I think we should revisit Guardians of the Galaxy, because I think it is a great movie.\n\n01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.000\nI did see it on like a hotel room TV.\n\n01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:52.000\nYeah, we'll watch it again, we'll give it a...\n\n01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000\nHave you seen Boyhood?\n\n01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.000\nNo, I haven't seen it.\n\n01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000\nThat's the thing about good movies, is you hear the good, the generally good movies are like,\n\n01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000\nI'm never in the mood to watch them.\n\n01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000\nBecause I'm like, oh Boyhood, that sounds like it's going to break my fucking heart,\n\n01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:07.000\nso maybe I want to kill myself.\n\n01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:13.000\nSpeaking of Boyhood, before we left, Patricia O'Kowt won the Oscar for Best Actress\n\n01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:15.000\nor Best Supporting Actress.\n\n01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:19.000\nOn the red carpet, Dan and I were watching red carpet footage\n\n01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:21.000\nand she was being interviewed and she said,\n\n01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:26.000\nwell, I mean, one of the things I really like about me is how much I care about other people.\n\n01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:29.000\nShe said what I like about me, really?\n\n01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000\nYeah, that's literally what she said, almost verbatim.\n\n01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:34.000\nAnd then they said like, well, let's hear from your daughter\n\n01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:36.000\nand they're introducing a new archette to us.\n\n01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:40.000\nAnd you can see it here in her daughter's eyes where she's like, oh, it's great.\n\n01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:42.000\nSay what she wants me to say.\n\n01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:48.000\nYeah, I guess this is a great time, because my mom, it's just a great,\n\n01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000\nlike she's come a long way because people are finally starting to recognize her.\n\n01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:57.000\nI was like, oh, man, don't feed your daughter lines on the SUV on the way to the,\n\n01:05:58.000 --> 01:05:59.000\nthese are our cats.\n\n01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000\nI was reading tweets, but she's a real carnation.\n\n01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000\nI went in this, I went in the other room because it was playing loud\n\n01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:07.000\nand Dan and I weren't in the same room and that happened.\n\n01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:09.000\nAnd I said, ah, 45 seconds.\n\n01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:13.000\nThat's the amount of time it takes for me to go from loving Patricia O'Kowt to not.\n\n01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000\nWhat was this guy yelling about over here?\n\n01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:18.000\nSomeone was yelling, who's yelling?\n\n01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000\nCan we tell the,\n\n01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000\nwhat were you what what what what the what the fuck.\n\n01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000\nOh,\n\n01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.000\nwe accidentally?\n\n01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:32.000\nOkay.\n\n01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000\nIs that the code of fans?\n\n01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:39.000\nIs there any way to tell the carnations story?\n\n01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:41.000\nI think enough time has passed.\n\n01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:42.000\nRight?\n\n01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:43.000\nOkay.\n\n01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:45.000\nSo don't let us get out of the room.\n\n01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:49.160\nTell it again, you told it, it's a great story.\n\n01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:50.160\nWe did?\n\n01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:51.160\nYeah.\n\n01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:52.160\nThe Carnation story?\n\n01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:53.160\nOkay, we told it.\n\n01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:54.160\nHere?\n\n01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:55.160\nOn this show?\n\n01:06:55.160 --> 01:06:56.160\nYeah.\n\n01:06:56.160 --> 01:06:57.160\nOn this television show?\n\n01:06:57.160 --> 01:06:58.160\nYeah.\n\n01:06:58.160 --> 01:06:59.160\nOkay.\n\n01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:00.160\nAll right.\n\n01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:01.160\nWhat's the story?\n\n01:07:01.160 --> 01:07:02.160\nThe Carnation story.\n\n01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:03.160\nAll these in Kardashian's story.\n\n01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:04.160\nI don't know any Kardashian's story.\n\n01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:08.840\nWe were writing a pilot for the, David Arquette was giving us notes and he...\n\n01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:12.200\nAnd he kept using the word carnation for incarnation.\n\n01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:13.200\nRight.\n\n01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:20.200\nAnd I was like, this is a carnation of that and I wasn't listening to his words, I was\n\n01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:25.680\nlistening to his meaning more and I was like, fuck him, it's not a...\n\n01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:32.360\nAnd I finally, I burst out and Dan and Jay Johnston were there and I was like, and I\n\n01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:38.240\nfinally burst out and I said, it's not a carnation of that, it's a carnation of this.\n\n01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:41.840\nAnd I was like, Jesus Christ, don't fucking make fun of him on top of everything that we're\n\n01:07:41.840 --> 01:07:42.840\ngoing through.\n\n01:07:42.840 --> 01:07:46.280\nI could see them out of the corner of my eyes, kind of like, like, burying their heads.\n\n01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:47.280\nAnd I'm like, what...\n\n01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:48.280\nAnd I'm like...\n\n01:07:48.280 --> 01:07:49.280\nAnd then I think they're making fun of me.\n\n01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:50.280\nI'm like, carnate...\n\n01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:52.720\nOh, I'm saying carnation instead of incarnation.\n\n01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:57.400\nAnd I've out loud, I said, carnation, what am I, a fucking retard?\n\n01:07:57.400 --> 01:07:59.800\nLike, he didn't...\n\n01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:00.800\nYeah.\n\n01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:05.040\nAnd I had no idea I was repeating David Arquette's word.\n\n01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:08.240\nAnd they thought I was a hero, like, wow, this fucking guy.\n\n01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:11.840\nI did not think you were a hero.\n\n01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:17.280\nI mean, I didn't think you were a villain, but I was, I knew at that moment I was blessed\n\n01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:20.840\nto have you in my life, but I didn't think you were a hero.\n\n01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:26.360\nLike, I was just, I thought our life was a movie, I wasn't sure if there was a central\n\n01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:27.360\ncharacter or not.\n\n01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:30.720\nSpeaking of due, Johnson, are you allowed to say what you're the cool thing that

01:14:01.840\nI, I was sure you, the first word you were going to say was rising.\n\n01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:05.160\nDan, you, you want to give a try for your dick, Dan?\n\n01:14:05.160 -->

dimensions, unimpressively\n\n01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:28.880\nsimplistic pink monolith, switches from its pivot point on the lower abdomen of the voice\n\n01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:37.920\nof a new generation, dribbling with, with viscous pre-com, shit.\n\n01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:44.080\nDo my dick, do my dick.\n\n01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:46.880\nSame, same music?\n\n01:14:46.880 -->

it.\n\n01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:52.360\nI like how you rush to reach it.\n\n01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:53.360\nNo, no, whatever.\n\n01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:54.360\nYeah, well, I saw your eyes.\n\n01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:55.360\nDon't stop coming around.\n\n01:16:55.360 --> 01:16:56.360\nHe's like, is that what you're doing?\n\n01:16:56.360 --> 01:16:57.360\nYeah, well, I saw your eyes.\n\n01:16:57.360 --> 01:16:58.360\nYeah, well, I saw your eyes.\n\n01:16:58.360 --> 01:16:59.360\nDon't stop coming around.\n\n01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:00.360\nHe's like, is that what you're doing?\n\n01:17:00.360 --> 01:17:01.360\nYeah, well, I saw your eyes.\n\n01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:02.360\nYeah, well, I saw your eyes.\n\n01:17:02.360 --> 01:17:09.360\nDon't stop coming around.\n\n01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:15.360\nHe's like, is that what that pitch for an adult swim show was?\n\n01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:17.360\nDid you and Andy ever have any mess around?\n\n01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:18.360\nNo, he never hit on me.\n\n01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:19.360\nI'm so upset.\n\n01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:20.360\nYou're the only one.\n\n01:17:20.360 --> 01:17:21.360\nYeah.\n\n01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:22.360\nI mean, I'm not attracted to him.\n\n01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:23.360\nFuck him.\n\n01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:25.360\nI was in a hotel room at Disneyland.\n\n01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:26.360\nOf course, he wants you.\n\n01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:27.360\nReally badly.\n\n01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:28.360\nAnd there was a girl there.\n\n01:17:28.360 --> 01:17:29.360\nWe're like, we're getting better.\n\n01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:32.360\nAnd he was trying to fuck everybody in the building.\n\n01:17:32.360 --> 01:17:34.360\nAnd he's just the most rampant.\n\n01:17:34.360 --> 01:17:35.360\nYeah, except me.\n\n01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:36.360\nExcept you.\n\n01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:37.360\nYeah, nothing.\n\n01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:38.360\nWhat's that about?\n\n01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:39.360\nI don't know.\n\n01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:40.360\nI'm ugly.\n\n01:17:40.360 --> 01:17:41.360\nYeah, poor me.\n\n01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:42.360\nNot in New York, you're not.\n\n01:17:42.360 --> 01:17:43.360\nNo, no.\n\n01:17:43.360 --> 01:17:45.360\nGet over here.\n\n01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:48.360\nAll right.\n\n01:17:48.360 --> 01:17:55.360\nWell, so we're going to play Shadow Run now.\n\n01:17:55.360 --> 01:17:59.360\nDino, you were very, you were not a team player.\n\n01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:00.360\nWith Dungeons and Dragons.\n\n01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:01.360\nRight.\n\n01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:04.360\nBut Shadow Run sounds fun.\n\n01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:07.360\nFuck, Ollie.\n\n01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:11.360\nI don't have to like anything you like.\n\n01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:15.360\nSpencer is in charge of the role-playing section.\n\n01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:17.360\nDo you think that, not to put you on the spot,\n\n01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:19.360\nbut should Dino leave or should he leave?\n\n01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:20.360\nYeah, I should leave.\n\n01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:22.360\nPlease, let me leave.\n\n01:18:22.360 --> 01:18:23.360\nWell, whatever Dino wants.\n\n01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:26.360\nWhat if Dino can watch it and we can hear what he thinks of it after?\n\n01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:27.360\nHe could do a little rap.\n\n01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:31.360\nMaybe I'll come back and talk about it and make fun of you.\n\n01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:33.360\nHow about he stays up here but doesn't play.\n\n01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:35.360\nNo, I want to go.\n\n01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:36.360\nYou want to go?\n\n01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:38.360\nYeah, there's a bar around the corner.\n\n01:18:38.360 --> 01:18:39.360\nWell, let's all thank Dino.\n\n01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:40.360\nStay up on top of the stage.\n\n01:18:40.360 --> 01:18:41.360\nYay!\n\n01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:45.360\nThere, I did it.\n\n01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:47.360\nThank you, Dino.\n\n01:18:47.360 --> 01:18:55.360\nAnd the moment you learn to take charge of your show,\n\n01:18:55.360 --> 01:19:03.360\nI can see your abilities as a host to grow.\n\n01:19:03.360 --> 01:19:04.360\nAll right, Spencer.\n\n01:19:04.360 --> 01:19:05.360\nFamily.\n\n01:19:05.360 --> 01:19:08.360\nDan, would you pass out the character sheets for us since you're up?\n\n01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:11.360\nCharacter sheets.\n\n01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:14.360\nAll right, Spencer, do you want to do like an intro from last time?\n\n01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:17.360\nWell, I mean, I can do one.\n\n01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:21.360\nI was just, last time we had Dan do a recap and I really liked that.\n\n01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:22.360\nI don't know if Dan remembers.\n\n01:19:22.360 --> 01:19:25.360\nWell, I don't remember this time as much.\n\n01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:28.360\nDoes Jeff remember anything or any of you?\n\n01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:30.360\nI remember that we didn't do it.\n\n01:19:30.360 --> 01:19:35.360\nI mean, we killed those guards up front and we went back into the warehouse.\n\n01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:40.360\nI cast a fart spirit that went into the door and knocked out three drug addicts,\n\n01:19:40.360 --> 01:19:44.360\nlike kind of like workers, and then two guys escaped and there was a seam in a wall\n\n01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:46.360\nthat was clearly a door that they had used to escape from.\n\n01:19:46.360 --> 01:19:49.360\nSo we are either in pursuit of them, which I imagine we are.\n\n01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:53.360\nIf you just play like synth music while you do this.\n\n01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:55.360\nIs Dimarch here?\n\n01:19:55.360 --> 01:19:57.360\nOh, is Dimarch here? Jesus.\n\n01:19:57.360 --> 01:19:58.360\nIs Dimarch?\n\n01:19:58.360 --> 01:20:00.360\nNo, Dimarch? Going once?\n\n01:20:00.360 --> 01:20:02.360\nNo, Dimarch.\n\n01:20:02.360 --> 01:20:03.360\nWhat are we going to do?\n\n01:20:03.360 --> 01:20:05.360\nWe need our eye in the sky.\n\n01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:07.360\nWe need that.\n\n01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:09.360\nCan somebody play Dimarch?\n\n01:20:09.360 --> 01:20:10.360\nWhat's your call?\n\n01:20:10.360 --> 01:20:11.360\nHey, I don't care.\n\n01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:12.360\nWho knows Dimarch?\n\n01:20:12.360 --> 01:20:14.360\nWait, is it a gal?\n\n01:20:14.360 --> 01:20:15.360\nOh, yeah, you are there.\n\n01:20:15.360 --> 01:20:17.360\nLet's get a woman up here to play.\n\n01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:19.360\nYeah, you can come on up.\n\n01:20:26.360 --> 01:20:30.360\nWell, her actual name is Meg Ryan on Oscar night.\n\n01:20:36.360 --> 01:20:37.360\nWho is this guy over there?\n\n01:20:37.360 --> 01:20:38.360\nWhat's going on over there?\n\n01:20:38.360 --> 01:20:41.360\nHe's having a tough time over there.\n\n01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:44.360\nMy heart kind of goes out to him because at one point we were like,\n\n01:20:44.360 --> 01:20:45.360\nHey, what's going on?\n\n01:20:45.360 --> 01:20:46.360\nAnd then everyone looked at me and went,\n\n01:20:46.360 --> 01:20:47.360\nWhat? What?\n\n01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:48.360\nNothing's going on.\n\n01:20:48.360 --> 01:20:49.360\nIt's not important.\n\n01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:50.360\nWhat?\n\n01:20:50.360 --> 01:20:51.360\nIt's important.\n\n01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:52.360\nNo, he's okay.\n\n01:20:52.360 --> 01:20:56.360\nI mean, people come here to work stuff out, I guess.\n\n01:20:56.360 --> 01:21:02.360\nThe nine people sitting around you didn't come here to work anything out,\n\n01:21:02.360 --> 01:21:04.360\nbut I'll give them five bucks after the show.\n\n01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:08.360\nI feel like we have the more kind of baritone,\n\n01:21:08.360 --> 01:21:10.360\nactivated Adam Goldberg over there.\n\n01:21:14.360 --> 01:21:15.360\nYou did it to yourself.\n\n01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:19.360\nSpoken like an Adam Goldberg.\n\n01:21:19.360 --> 01:21:20.360\nDo you know him?\n\n01:21:20.360 --> 01:21:22.360\nYou're kind of talking to him like you know him.\n\n01:21:22.360 --> 01:21:23.360\nNo, I don't know him at all,\n\n01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:25.360\nbut I know who Adam Goldberg is.\n\n01:21:25.360 --> 01:21:28.360\nHere we are.\n\n01:21:28.360 --> 01:21:29.360\nAre you on methadone?\n\n01:21:29.360 --> 01:21:32.360\nWhat's going on over there?\n\n01:21:32.360 --> 01:21:39.360\nIt's like the Adam Goldberg 45 played at 78.\n\n01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:47.360\nAren't you going to pay attention to me?\n\n01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:50.360\nMeg, is there a reason why you go by Megan at Megan?\n\n01:21:50.360 --> 01:21:54.360\nI was a very young child when a small elementary school teacher said,\n\n01:21:54.360 --> 01:21:56.360\nOh, Meg Ryan, like the actress.\n\n01:21:56.360 --> 01:21:57.360\nAnd then they never let you-\n\n01:21:57.360 --> 01:22:01.360\nAnd then they got my BFA in acting and so it's funny.\n\n01:22:01.360 --> 01:22:03.360\nI'm mad at me for asking.\n\n01:22:03.360 --> 01:22:05.360\nI feel like you're going to hit me.\n\n01:22:05.360 --> 01:22:06.360\nNo.\n\n01:22:06.360 --> 01:22:08.360\nIf you were the first, it would be cute.\n\n01:22:08.360 --> 01:22:10.360\nIf you were the 50th, it's still cute.\n\n01:22:10.360 --> 01:22:12.360\nAnd so you're 50th, so it's fine.\n\n01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:13.360\nI mean, you brought it up.\n\n01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:14.360\nYou walked up.\n\n01:22:14.360 --> 01:22:15.360\nI did.\n\n01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:16.360\nYou said, yes, really?\n\n01:22:16.360 --> 01:22:17.360\nI did.\n\n01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:18.360\nOkay.\n\n01:22:18.360 --> 01:22:20.360\nWell, this is going to be great.\n\n01:22:20.360 --> 01:22:22.360\nCool energy.\n\n01:22:22.360 --> 01:22:24.360\nMe to the yow.\n\n01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:26.360\nI misinterpreted her energy too.\n\n01:22:26.360 --> 01:22:28.360\nI thought she knew that guy.\n\n01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:30.360\nI think she's just an assertive person.\n\n01:22:30.360 --> 01:22:31.360\nShe knows your station in life.\n\n01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:36.360\nDo you- I hope that you are a forensics detective?\n\n01:22:36.360 --> 01:22:40.360\nOr a DMV supervisor?\n\n01:22:40.360 --> 01:22:41.360\nI just play them on TV.\n\n01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:42.360\nIt's fine.\n\n01:22:42.360 --> 01:22:43.360\nOh, you're an actor?\n\n01:22:43.360 --> 01:22:44.360\nYes.\n\n01:22:44.360 --> 01:22:45.360\nOh, okay.\n\n01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:46.360\nOh boy.\n\n01:22:46.360 --> 01:22:47.360\nYour name's Meg Ryan?\n\n01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:48.360\nYes.\n\n01:22:48.360 --> 01:22:49.360\nGood luck.\n\n01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:53.360\nNot the first time I've heard it.\n\n01:22:53.360 --> 01:22:54.360\nThere's a weird energy overall.\n\n01:22:54.360 --> 01:22:56.360\nI wonder if it's a- it was not a joke.\n\n01:22:56.360 --> 01:22:58.360\nI wonder if it's because everyone's kind of- everyone's grieving.\n\n01:22:58.360 --> 01:23:00.360\nThere's like a sadness in the air.\n\n01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:02.360\nEven if you didn't-\n\n01:23:02.360 --> 01:23:03.360\nSure.\n\n01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:04.360\nYeah.\n\n01:23:04.360 --> 01:23:05.360\nI don't know.\n\n01:23:05.360 --> 01:23:06.360\nCan we go back?\n\n01:23:06.360 --> 01:23:07.360\nCan we go back?\n\n01:23:07.360 --> 01:23:08.360\nNot to make this about me, but-\n\n01:23:08.360 --> 01:23:11.360\nThat was a pretty good- oh, like Baldwin I was doing there.\n\n01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:12.360\nI have to say that was-\n\n01:23:12.360 --> 01:23:13.360\nThat was a good-\n\n01:23:13.360 --> 01:23:14.360\nIt was.\n\n01:23:14.360 --> 01:23:15.360\nThat was great.\n\n01:23:15.360 --> 01:23:16.360\nI've never-\n\n01:23:16.360 --> 01:23:17.360\nGreat.\n\n01:23:17.360 --> 01:23:19.360\nI've never really tried to do an Alec Baldwin in front of people.\n\n01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:20.360\nI think I might-\n\n01:23:20.360 --> 01:23:21.360\nI thought you should have done Oprah.\n\n01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:22.360\nIt was really good.\n\n01:23:22.360 --> 01:23:23.360\nPardon?\n\n01:23:23.360 --> 01:23:24.360\nI thought you should have done Oprah.\n\n01:23:24.360 --> 01:23:25.360\nOprah, so there's that.\n\n01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:26.360\nNow you're on my dick.\n\n01:23:26.360 --> 01:23:27.360\nNo, I'm kidding.\n\n01:23:27.360 --> 01:23:28.360\nHarry.\n\n01:23:28.360 --> 01:23:29.360\nAh, yeah.\n\n01:23:29.360 --> 01:23:33.360\nDo you remember when we found out I do a pretty good Terrence Howard?\n\n01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:35.360\nYes, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:23:35.360 --> 01:23:37.360\nWhich is the same- it's the same- sounds the same as-\n\n01:23:37.360 --> 01:23:40.360\nOne of you three Negroes is going to step up.\n\n01:23:40.360 --> 01:23:42.360\nIt's a quote from Empire.\n\n01:23:42.360 --> 01:23:44.360\nAnd take over my record label.\n\n01:23:44.360 --> 01:23:46.360\nWait, is he Irish?\n\n01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:48.360\nAh, he's Terrence Howard, he's-\n\n01:23:48.360 --> 01:23:49.360\nTake over my record label.\n\n01:23:49.360 --> 01:23:51.360\nI want you to do that song again.\n\n01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:54.360\nOnly do it like your mother was being shot.\n\n01:23:54.360 --> 01:23:58.360\nDid you- was it- am I mistaken, Dana?\n\n01:23:58.360 --> 01:23:59.360\nDid you do a John Malkovich for a while?\n\n01:23:59.360 --> 01:24:00.360\nCould you do a John Malkovich?\n\n01:24:00.360 --> 01:24:01.360\nNo, I don't-\n\n01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:02.360\nWas that a Schrab?\n\n01:24:02.360 --> 01:24:03.360\nThat's a tough one, yeah.\n\n01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:05.360\nTry a John Malkovich.\n\n01:24:05.360 --> 01:24:07.360\nCold.\n\n01:24:07.360 --> 01:24:09.360\nPain.\n\n01:24:09.360 --> 01:24:12.360\nI don't understand.\n\n01:24:12.360 --> 01:24:15.360\nWhy are you asking me to do John Malkovich?\n\n01:24:15.360 --> 01:24:16.360\nThat's not bad.\n\n01:24:16.360 --> 01:24:17.360\nYou were there- you were halfway there.\n\n01:24:17.360 --> 01:24:19.360\nYeah, it's not- you know.\n\n01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:20.360\nAlright, so are we recaptured?\n\n01:24:20.360 --> 01:24:21.360\nShould we try this again?\n\n01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:23.360\nOr should we just dive right into this, motherfucker?\n\n01:24:23.360 --> 01:24:26.360\nYou should, uh, well, deal with music.\n\n01:24:26.360 --> 01:24:27.360\nAlright.\n\n01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:28.360\nWho's meter or you do it?\n\n01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:29.360\nI think you should-\n\n01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:30.360\nYou- no, no, you do it.\n\n01:24:30.360 --> 01:24:31.360\nYou did a great job.\n\n01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:32.360\nSpencer?\n\n01:24:32.360 --> 01:24:33.360\nIt just needed music.\n\n01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:34.360\nAnd who's Meg Ryan playing?\n\n01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:35.360\nUh, she'll be playing-\n\n01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:37.360\nOh, God, uh, and when Harry met Sally,\n\n01:24:37.360 --> 01:24:40.360\nshe plays just every woman.\n\n01:24:40.360 --> 01:24:43.360\nEveryone will have what I'm having.\n\n01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:44.360\nEveryone will have what I'm having.\n\n01:24:44.360 --> 01:24:45.360\nSpencer is not-\n\n01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:46.360\nI get to the deli.\n\n01:24:46.360 --> 01:24:47.360\nAs comptroller, I'm going to outrank you, Spencer,\n\n01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:48.360\nbecause I love when you do it,\n\n01:24:48.360 --> 01:24:49.360\nand I want to hear you do it for us,\n\n01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:50.360\nif you don't mind.\n\n01:24:50.360 --> 01:24:51.360\nAlright.\n\n01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:53.360\nWhat's happening?\n\n01:24:53.360 --> 01:24:55.360\nWrong song?\n\n01:24:55.360 --> 01:24:58.360\nUh, here we go.\n\n01:24:58.360 --> 01:25:00.360\nShadow Run.\n\n01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:03.360\nI'm going to recap.\n\n01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:05.360\nStarting in the warehouse district,\n\n01:25:05.360 --> 01:25:09.360\nour heroes infiltrated and stuff.\n\n01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:11.360\nThey stunned two guards indoors,\n\n01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:15.360\nand then conspired to take out the three guards.\n\n01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:18.360\nBut then a tear gas grenade went in the window,\n\n01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:22.360\nand through their plans, a riot.\n\n01:25:22.360 --> 01:25:25.360\nAfter killing the guards and setting off an alarm,\n\n01:25:25.360 --> 01:25:27.360\nthey charged indoors, where their target,\n\n01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:31.360\nBaldwin Brown, was no longer able to be found.\n\n01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:35.360\nBut the rest of the enemies were knocked out\n\n01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:41.360\nby a spirit that had a wife who made soup.\n\n01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:43.360\nAfter stunning the guards,\n\n01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:45.360\nour heroes were left with a conundrum.\n\n01:25:45.360 --> 01:25:47.360\nWhere was Baldwin Brown?\n\n01:25:47.360 --> 01:25:49.360\nWhat would they do?\n\n01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:51.360\nThere they are.\n\n01:25:51.360 --> 01:25:53.360\nAlright, thank you, Spencer.\n\n01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:55.360\nAlright.\n\n01:25:55.360 --> 01:25:58.360\nAre we all in that room with those machines?\n\n01:25:58.360 --> 01:26:00.360\nYeah, you're all in this machine room.\n\n01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:02.360\nYeah, you're in the warehouse.\n\n01:26:02.360 --> 01:26:03.360\nThere's a bunch of junkies.\n\n01:26:03.360 --> 01:26:04.360\nThey're starting to get up.\n\n01:26:04.360 --> 01:26:05.360\nI mean, there's not a bunch.\n\n01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:06.360\nThere's three junkies.\n\n01:26:06.360 --> 01:26:08.360\nThey're shambling around.\n\n01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:11.360\nThey're looking around the open crates in the warehouse.\n\n01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:15.360\nWas I able to successfully convince them\n\n01:26:15.360 --> 01:26:16.360\nthat everything was fine?\n\n01:26:16.360 --> 01:26:18.360\nAre they trusting us?\n\n01:26:18.360 --> 01:26:20.360\nThey're not really paying too much attention.\n\n01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:22.360\nThey're probably going to go right into those crates\n\n01:26:22.360 --> 01:26:24.360\nand get better than life chips.\n\n01:26:24.360 --> 01:26:26.360\nYeah, because they're all drugied.\n\n01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:28.360\nBut they don't seem to pose much threat to us right now.\n\n01:26:28.360 --> 01:26:31.360\nI don't know how much is in my head when I'm that drunk,\n\n01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:33.360\nbut I wanted to stun Baton them\n\n01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:36.360\nand just keep the scene here.\n\n01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:39.360\nLike these guys who are wandering.\n\n01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:41.360\nI just want to stun each of them.\n\n01:26:41.360 --> 01:26:45.360\nWhat's your clubs plus agility?\n\n01:26:45.360 --> 01:26:49.360\nBluff called?\n\n01:26:49.360 --> 01:26:51.360\nClubs plus agility.\n\n01:26:51.360 --> 01:26:56.360\nI mean, mostly I like dubstep.\n\n01:26:56.360 --> 01:26:59.360\nWow.\n\n01:26:59.360 --> 01:27:02.360\nI don't know what that phrase means.\n\n01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:06.360\nClubs agility says three for rating.\n\n01:27:06.360 --> 01:27:08.360\nSo what's agility then?\n\n01:27:08.360 --> 01:27:09.360\nMy agility is five.\n\n01:27:09.360 --> 01:27:10.360\nAwesome.\n\n01:27:10.360 --> 01:27:15.360\nYou...\n\n01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:18.360\nYou stun one of the guys\n\n01:27:18.360 --> 01:27:21.360\nand then the others they kind of freak out\n\n01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:23.360\nand start running around in circles.\n\n01:27:23.360 --> 01:27:25.360\nSit down or it's going to get worse than life.\n\n01:27:25.360 --> 01:27:27.360\nI go up to them.\n\n01:27:27.360 --> 01:27:29.360\nHey, night play. Take it easy.\n\n01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:30.360\nI got this.\n\n01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:32.360\nI go up to them with my shot gloves\n\n01:27:32.360 --> 01:27:34.360\nbecause my little fingerless punk rock gloves\n\n01:27:34.360 --> 01:27:35.360\nare actually electrified shot gloves\n\n01:27:35.360 --> 01:27:36.360\nand I go,\n\n01:27:36.360 --> 01:27:40.360\nOh my God.\n\n01:27:40.360 --> 01:27:42.360\nAre they close enough together to do both?\n\n01:27:42.360 --> 01:27:43.360\nNo.\n\n01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:45.360\nOkay, then I go up and I give it to one of them.\n\n01:27:45.360 --> 01:27:46.360\nRight in the ass.\n\n01:27:46.360 --> 01:27:47.360\nAll right.\n\n01:27:47.360 --> 01:27:48.360\nWhat's your...\n\n01:27:48.360 --> 01:27:50.360\nWhat's your clubs plus agility?\n\n01:27:50.360 --> 01:27:51.360\nI have four...\n\n01:27:51.360 --> 01:27:53.360\nOh, it's eight plus four.\n\n01:27:53.360 --> 01:27:54.360\nAll right.\n\n01:27:54.360 --> 01:27:55.360\nThat's a lot.\n\n01:27:55.360 --> 01:27:56.360\nI know.\n\n01:27:56.360 --> 01:27:57.360\nAll right.\n\n01:27:57.360 --> 01:27:59.360\nYou also stun the person.\n\n01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:00.360\nAll right.\n\n01:28:00.360 --> 01:28:01.360\nHe goes down.\n\n01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:04.360\nTwelve.\n\n01:28:04.360 --> 01:28:06.360\nI'm just kidding.\n\n01:28:06.360 --> 01:28:07.360\nNo, it is 12.\n\n01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:08.360\nI know, I know.\n\n01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:10.360\nThat delay was a joke.\n\n01:28:10.360 --> 01:28:12.360\nIs this other guy like chasing by this?\n\n01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:14.360\nIs he wanting to play ball?\n\n01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:15.360\nIs he still running around?\n\n01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:17.360\nOh, he's freaking out even more.\n\n01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:18.360\nHe's at the door now.\n\n01:28:18.360 --> 01:28:19.360\nNight play.\n\n01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:20.360\nTake this guy down.\n\n01:28:20.360 --> 01:28:21.360\nAll right.\n\n01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:23.360\nI take him down.\n\n01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:25.360\nWhat does that mean?\n\n01:28:25.360 --> 01:28:26.360\nWhat do you do?\n\n01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:29.360\nDo you handle him a horde of guard?\n\n01:28:29.360 --> 01:28:30.360\nWho am I?\n\n01:28:30.360 --> 01:28:31.360\nAre you sure?\n\n01:28:31.360 --> 01:28:32.360\nYeah.\n\n01:28:32.360 --> 01:28:35.360\nI figured it'll go faster since...\n\n01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:37.360\nBecause I don't have a problem with killing people.\n\n01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:38.360\nIs that what it's about?\n\n01:28:38.360 --> 01:28:39.360\nNo, because it's your turn.\n\n01:28:39.360 --> 01:28:41.360\nI assume it was sort of that way.\n\n01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:43.360\nUnder your special skills on your resume,\n\n01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:45.360\ndo you have Norwegian accent?\n\n01:28:45.360 --> 01:28:47.360\nI'm worried about Baldwin.\n\n01:28:47.360 --> 01:28:48.360\nOh, go ahead.\n\n01:28:48.360 --> 01:28:50.360\nYeah, we're wasting time at Baldwin's escaping right now.\n\n01:28:50.360 --> 01:28:53.360\nDo not have the Norwegian, but I have the German.\n\n01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:54.360\nIf you'd like the German.\n\n01:28:54.360 --> 01:28:55.360\nClose enough.\n\n01:28:55.360 --> 01:28:58.360\nI have the German, yeah.\n\n01:28:58.360 --> 01:29:01.360\nI have nothing interesting of any kind.\n\n01:29:01.360 --> 01:29:03.360\nYou don't have to do that.\n\n01:29:03.360 --> 01:29:04.360\nIt sounds great.\n\n01:29:04.360 --> 01:29:06.360\nNow I feel bad about pimping you out.\n\n01:29:06.360 --> 01:29:08.360\nNow you've put me on the spot.\n\n01:29:08.360 --> 01:29:09.360\nNow I have to do it.\n\n01:29:09.360 --> 01:29:10.360\nOh, okay.\n\n01:29:10.360 --> 01:29:11.360\nYou did this to yourself.\n\n01:29:11.360 --> 01:29:12.360\nIt's your fault.\n\n01:29:12.360 --> 01:29:13.360\nYes.\n\n01:29:13.360 --> 01:29:15.360\nThere actually is going to be a fight.\n\n01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:16.360\nI love it.\n\n01:29:16.360 --> 01:29:21.360\nI've never been in a fight.\n\n01:29:21.360 --> 01:29:25.360\nWe're not in combat right now.\n\n01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:26.360\nAnybody can go, right?\n\n01:29:26.360 --> 01:29:27.360\nYeah, no.\n\n01:29:27.360 --> 01:29:30.360\nIt's just all whatever.\n\n01:29:30.360 --> 01:29:34.360\nDo you know that Michael Keaton's original real name is Michael Douglas,\n\n01:29:34.360 --> 01:29:40.360\nand he had to change it?\n\n01:29:40.360 --> 01:29:43.360\nMeg Ryan's real name is Margaret Hyra.\n\n01:29:43.360 --> 01:29:44.360\nOh.\n\n01:29:44.360 --> 01:29:45.360\nYou're welcome.\n\n01:29:45.360 --> 01:29:48.360\nI talked about it for a stage name once.\n\n01:29:48.360 --> 01:29:51.360\nYou love Meg Ryan.\n\n01:29:51.360 --> 01:29:53.360\nYou love her.\n\n01:29:53.360 --> 01:29:55.360\nOf course, she's America's sweetheart.\n\n01:29:55.360 --> 01:29:56.360\nNo, a professor told me once.\n\n01:29:56.360 --> 01:29:57.360\nShe told me I needed to remember that\n\n01:29:57.360 --> 01:30:00.360\nbecause it would be funny once.\n\n01:30:00.360 --> 01:30:01.360\nWhile this is happening,\n\n01:30:01.360 --> 01:30:02.360\nI walk up in shock,\n\n01:30:02.360 --> 01:30:03.360\nlove the other guy that's running around.\n\n01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:04.360\nThank you.\n\n01:30:04.360 --> 01:30:08.360\nAll right.\n\n01:30:08.360 --> 01:30:11.360\nHe dodges out of the way\n\n01:30:11.360 --> 01:30:13.360\nand runs out the door.\n\n01:30:13.360 --> 01:30:14.360\nHe's gone.\n\n01:30:14.360 --> 01:30:17.360\nYou got a junkie on the loose.\n\n01:30:17.360 --> 01:30:19.360\nDon't you have mental powers?\n\n01:30:19.360 --> 01:30:23.360\nWe're looking for this Baldwin, Billy Jack guy.\n\n01:30:23.360 --> 01:30:24.360\nThis mission's a wash.\n\n01:30:24.360 --> 01:30:25.360\nIf we don't find this guy,\n\n01:30:25.360 --> 01:30:26.360\nwe haven't seen him yet.\n\n01:30:26.360 --> 01:30:27.360\nI don't know his name,\n\n01:30:27.360 --> 01:30:28.360\nbut, however, can I sense the room\n\n01:30:28.360 --> 01:30:30.360\nto see if he's in the area?\n\n01:30:30.360 --> 01:30:35.360\nYou sense a living person in the room,\n\n01:30:35.360 --> 01:30:36.360\nbut you don't know where.\n\n01:30:36.360 --> 01:30:38.360\nJust in the general vicinity.\n\n01:30:38.360 --> 01:30:41.360\nOh, he's hiding in that wall seam thingy right there.\n\n01:30:41.360 --> 01:30:42.360\nHe's in the wall seam.\n\n01:30:42.360 --> 01:30:43.360\nWe think it's a door, yes?\n\n01:30:43.360 --> 01:30:44.360\nYes.\n\n01:30:44.360 --> 01:30:45.360\nYes.\n\n01:30:45.360 --> 01:30:46.360\nAll right.\n\n01:30:46.360 --> 01:30:47.360\nI think we go to the door to open it.\n\n01:30:47.360 --> 01:30:50.360\nDoes anyone want you to have a gun on this person?\n\n01:30:50.360 --> 01:30:51.360\nI think we should all have a gun.\n\n01:30:51.360 --> 01:30:52.360\nBe ready for anything.\n\n01:30:52.360 --> 01:30:53.360\nWe all should.\n\n01:30:53.360 --> 01:30:55.360\nSpencer, can I sense who's on the other side of the door?\n\n01:30:55.360 --> 01:30:56.360\nYou can't sense who it is.\n\n01:30:56.360 --> 01:30:57.360\nAll right.\n\n01:30:57.360 --> 01:30:59.360\nLet me go grab the junkie just in case.\n\n01:30:59.360 --> 01:31:00.360\nOh, okay.\n\n01:31:00.360 --> 01:31:01.360\nYeah, I was going to go.\n\n01:31:01.360 --> 01:31:02.360\nDo you want to see?\n\n01:31:02.360 --> 01:31:05.360\nMy OCD is like this junkie just running.\n\n01:31:05.360 --> 01:31:07.360\nLike I'm going nuts now.\n\n01:31:07.360 --> 01:31:08.360\nIt's a bad dream.\n\n01:31:08.360 --> 01:31:11.360\nSo just stay by the seam and do what you will.\n\n01:31:11.360 --> 01:31:12.360\nI'm going to grab the junkie.\n\n01:31:12.360 --> 01:31:13.360\nKeep on doing what you're doing.\n\n01:31:13.360 --> 01:31:14.360\nIt's working.\n\n01:31:14.360 --> 01:31:15.360\nI'm going to thank you.\n\n01:31:15.360 --> 01:31:16.360\nI don't know if that was sarcasm,\n\n01:31:16.360 --> 01:31:20.360\nbut I'm going to run after Pursue the Junkie.\n\n01:31:20.360 --> 01:31:21.360\nAll right.\n\n01:31:21.360 --> 01:31:22.360\nYou run out the door.\n\n01:31:22.360 --> 01:31:23.360\nIs anyone doing anything simultaneously\n\n01:31:23.360 --> 01:31:25.360\nor are you just going to wait for that to finish?\n\n01:31:25.360 --> 01:31:27.360\nI think we should all be ready to open that door\n\n01:31:27.360 --> 01:31:30.360\nand be ready for Baldwin in case he's got surprises for us.\n\n01:31:30.360 --> 01:31:31.360\nYes.\n\n01:31:31.360 --> 01:31:35.360\nAnd I'm currently wearing security guard clothes.\n\n01:31:35.360 --> 01:31:38.360\nAnd I am very charming.\n\n01:31:38.360 --> 01:31:40.360\nAnd you guys have my permission while I'm running.\n\n01:31:40.360 --> 01:31:45.360\nI'm sim-linking to say you guys can go on

feel, I'm the guy that had to collect\n\n01:31:51.360 --> 01:31:56.360\nall of the secret packages in GTA before I finished the A story,\n\n01:31:56.360 --> 01:31:57.360\nyou know.\n\n01:31:57.360 --> 01:31:59.360\nI'm going to unlock everything.\n\n01:31:59.360 --> 01:32:00.360\nI said the quicker you get that junkie\n\n01:32:00.360 --> 01:32:01.360\nand get back here, the better Nightblade.\n\n01:32:01.360 --> 01:32:03.360\nI agree, but just don't, I don't want to,\n\n01:32:03.360 --> 01:32:06.360\none of my biggest nightmares is you'll get to know me better,\n\n01:32:06.360 --> 01:32:08.360\nbut like feeling like I'm the reason why.\n\n01:32:08.360 --> 01:32:09.360\nAll right.\n\n01:32:09.360 --> 01:32:11.360\nWe don't have time to pacify you Nightblade.\n\n01:32:11.360 --> 01:32:12.360\nAll right.\n\n01:32:12.360 --> 01:32:13.360\nWe get it, but tick tock.\n\n01:32:13.360 --> 01:32:15.360\nI'm still, I'm multitasking.\n\n01:32:15.360 --> 01:32:17.360\nI'm saying this while I'm chasing the junkie.\n\n01:32:17.360 --> 01:32:18.360\nOkay.\n\n01:32:18.360 --> 01:32:20.360\nThank you.\n\n01:32:20.360 --> 01:32:25.360\nMy ghost and my dad is in a Tom Cruise,\n\n01:32:25.360 --> 01:32:29.360\nlike hologram chip in my brain.\n\n01:32:29.360 --> 01:32:33.360\nSo the rest of you guys are opening this door,\n\n01:32:33.360 --> 01:32:35.360\nswinging open the secret door.\n\n01:32:35.360 --> 01:32:38.360\nYou were faced with two silver looking barrels\n\n01:32:38.360 --> 01:32:39.360\nand nothing else.\n\n01:32:39.360 --> 01:32:42.360\nIt looks almost the size of a closet.\n\n01:32:42.360 --> 01:32:45.360\nYou hear a metallic whir as the barrels rise up into the air\n\n01:32:45.360 --> 01:32:51.360\nand underneath them a hostile looking gun slash camera armature.\n\n01:32:51.360 --> 01:32:53.360\nSome sort of century gun device.\n\n01:32:53.360 --> 01:32:58.360\nIt starts worrying as if it's about to shoot some fires.\n\n01:32:58.360 --> 01:32:59.360\nI dive out of the way.\n\n01:32:59.360 --> 01:33:03.360\nWhat's your reaction plus, what do you call it, intuition?\n\n01:33:03.360 --> 01:33:08.360\nThree plus seven total.\n\n01:33:08.360 --> 01:33:09.360\nSeven total.\n\n01:33:09.360 --> 01:33:11.360\nBut also I have like cat like and all that shit too.\n\n01:33:11.360 --> 01:33:13.360\nIs that sneaking right

01:33:19.360\nAll right.\n\n01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:21.360\nSorry everybody.\n\n01:33:21.360 --> 01:33:24.360\nYou get hit in the armor, but it bounces off because it's armor.\n\n01:33:24.360 --> 01:33:27.360\nYeah.\n\n01:33:27.360 --> 01:33:28.360\nThe rest of you guys.\n\n01:33:28.360 --> 01:33:30.360\nNo, you're right to applaud that.\n\n01:33:30.360 --> 01:33:35.360\nThe rest of you guys are just facing the century gun that's firing at Eve.\n\n01:33:35.360 --> 01:33:36.360\nOkay.\n\n01:33:36.360 --> 01:33:41.360\nI, all right, I know, I know that, well, so it's a cat.\n\n01:33:41.360

anyway.\n\n01:34:00.360 --> 01:34:01.360\nAll right.\n\n01:34:01.360 --> 01:34:03.360\nI look into the camera.\n\n01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:04.360\nHi.\n\n01:34:04.360 --> 01:34:07.360\nThere's a deal we can make here.\n\n01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:12.360\nWe are, we're not lame.\n\n01:34:12.360 --> 01:34:16.360\nYou're saying this while there's bullets flying around in the room?\n\n01:34:16.360 --> 01:34:17.360\nYeah.\n\n01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:18.360\nYeah.\n\n01:34:18.360 --> 01:34:21.360\nI do have, I'm still wearing, I still have that thing on right underneath my clothes.\n\n01:34:21.360 --> 01:34:22.360\nI have like armor on.\n\n01:34:22.360 --> 01:34:24.360\nI have like a bulletproof vest kind of.\n\n01:34:24.360 --> 01:34:25.360\nOkay.\n\n01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:26.360\nIt's true.\n\n01:34:26.360 --> 01:34:29.360\nWait, are you, you're not standing in front of the bullets though.\n\n01:34:29.360 --> 01:34:30.360\nNo.\n\n01:34:30.360 --> 01:34:31.360\nOkay.\n\n01:34:31.360 --> 01:34:32.360\nYeah.\n\n01:34:32.360 --> 01:34:34.360\nIf there's any response, you're not paying attention to one.\n\n01:34:34.360 --> 01:34:40.360\nYou think it might just be one of those like drone mounted guns, like not like controlled by anyone.\n\n01:34:40.360 --> 01:34:41.360\nCool.\n\n01:34:41.360 --> 01:34:42.360\nYeah.\n\n01:34:42.360 --> 01:34:44.360\nI mean, it's only kind of firing in one direction.\n\n01:34:44.360 --> 01:34:47.360\nSo you aren't really in any real danger anymore.\n\n01:34:47.360 --> 01:34:48.360\nOkay.\n\n01:34:48.360 --> 01:34:49.360\nAll right.\n\n01:34:49.360 --> 01:34:54.360\nWell, I'm just going to, just going to stand there and think about groceries I have to buy later, I guess.\n\n01:34:54.360 --> 01:34:56.360\nThe bullets run out of the machine.\n\n01:34:56.360 --> 01:34:58.360\nSo it's done firing now.\n\n01:34:58.360 --> 01:34:59.360\nPhew.\n\n01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:00.360\nHello.\n\n01:35:00.360 --> 01:35:05.360\nWe're here to talk if you're done showing off your trophy dick.\n\n01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:08.360\nIt's just a small empty closet sized room.\n\n01:35:08.360 --> 01:35:11.360\nAnd those two cylinders took off and left the room.\n\n01:35:11.360 --> 01:35:15.360\nThey kind of, it rose up and they were like hiding them, if that makes sense.\n\n01:35:15.360 --> 01:35:18.360\nYou know, it was on top of the guns as they rose out of the ground.\n\n01:35:18.360 --> 01:35:19.360\nOh, I got you.\n\n01:35:19.360 --> 01:35:20.360\nOkay.\n\n01:35:20.360 --> 01:35:21.360\nYeah.\n\n01:35:21.360 --> 01:35:24.360\nThe old gun turrets disguised as, we'll be right with you.\n\n01:35:24.360 --> 01:35:32.360\nBack in the junkies, the junkie is, he's running through the, he's running to the door that you cut open with your, your mono whip.\n\n01:35:32.360 --> 01:35:37.360\nWhat's your running plus agility?\n\n01:35:37.360 --> 01:35:39.360\nProbably like a million.\n\n01:35:39.360 --> 01:35:40.360\nYeah.\n\n01:35:40.360 --> 01:35:46.360\nRunning is, running is.\n\n01:35:46.360 --> 01:35:47.360\nOr athletics.\n\n01:35:47.360 --> 01:35:48.360\nRunning, running.\n\n01:35:48.360 --> 01:35:50.360\nAthletics are.\n\n01:35:50.360 --> 01:35:51.360\nI think it's running though.\n\n01:35:51.360 --> 01:35:52.360\nI mean, what do you even look at?\n\n01:35:52.360 --> 01:35:54.360\nYou might not have running.\n\n01:35:54.360 --> 01:35:56.360\nOh, it's, so it's a skill, it would be a skill.\n\n01:35:56.360 --> 01:35:57.360\nOkay, I have running.\n\n01:35:57.360 --> 01:36:00.360\nIt's three plus two.\n\n01:36:00.360 --> 01:36:01.360\nAwesome.\n\n01:36:01.360 --> 01:36:03.360\nI'll tell you what that is later.\n\n01:36:03.360 --> 01:36:08.360\nYou quickly chase him down and you grab him by whatever you want to grab him by.\n\n01:36:08.360 --> 01:36:09.360\nWhere do you want to grab him?\n\n01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:10.360\nHis junkie scruff.\n\n01:36:10.360 --> 01:36:16.360\nYou grab him there.\n\n01:36:16.360 --> 01:36:17.360\nHe's grabbed.\n\n01:36:17.360 --> 01:36:19.360\nHe's not very strong.\n\n01:36:19.360 --> 01:36:27.360\nWhoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, where's the fire?\n\n01:36:27.360 --> 01:36:29.360\nOh, everywhere.\n\n01:36:29.360 --> 01:36:30.360\nI got to get out of here.\n\n01:36:30.360 --> 01:36:34.360\nHey, listen, just let me, let me have a conversation with you.\n\n01:36:34.360 --> 01:36:35.360\nHe's struggling.\n\n01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:39.360\nHe's treading water.\n\n01:36:39.360 --> 01:36:44.360\nHow'd you, how'd you find out this was the place to get your, your chips on?\n\n01:36:44.360 --> 01:36:48.360\nMy man, Brown man, he hooks it up for all the junkies.\n\n01:36:48.360 --> 01:36:49.360\nHe really cares.\n\n01:36:49.360

Stacy.\n\n01:36:59.360 --> 01:37:10.360\nOh, I don't think you even know Baldwin.\n\n01:37:10.360 --> 01:37:14.360\nWhat's, what do you, don't kill me.\n\n01:37:14.360 --> 01:37:16.360\nWhy are you acting like you know Baldwin?\n\n01:37:16.360 --> 01:37:17.360\nYou don't know him?\n\n01:37:17.360 --> 01:37:19.360\nI didn't act like that.\n\n01:37:19.360 --> 01:37:20.360\nAlso, I do know him.\n\n01:37:20.360 --> 01:37:21.360\nNo, you don't.\n\n01:37:21.360 --> 01:37:22.360\nI'm going to kill you for not knowing him.\n\n01:37:22.360 --> 01:37:24.360\nYou can't prove you know him.\n\n01:37:24.360 --> 01:37:28.360\nYou're not proving you know him enough for me to not kill you.\n\n01:37:28.360 --> 01:37:30.360\nYou got to prove you know him.\n\n01:37:30.360 --> 01:37:32.360\nBaldwin, I'm on the, on the, on the com link.\n\n01:37:32.360 --> 01:37:33.360\nWhat's going on out there?\n\n01:37:33.360 --> 01:37:34.360\nIt sounds like things are going bad.\n\n01:37:34.360 --> 01:37:36.360\nHey, just get some information.\n\n01:37:36.360 --> 01:37:46.360\nWe have a cyber Goldberg out here.\n\n01:37:46.360 --> 01:37:51.360\nI love that your Jim Nightblade sounds like Bruce Willis as portrayed by Justin\n\n01:37:51.360 --> 01:37:58.360\nRoyland.\n\n01:37:58.360 --> 01:38:00.360\nIf you know him so good, where is he?\n\n01:38:00.360 --> 01:38:03.360\nHe must have took off when that siren happened.\n\n01:38:03.360 --> 01:38:05.360\nThe alarm, I mean, the security one.\n\n01:38:05.360 --> 01:38:06.360\nWhere does he go?\n\n01:38:06.360 --> 01:38:07.360\nNib chips.\n\n01:38:07.360 --> 01:38:08.360\nWhere does he go?\n\n01:38:08.360 --> 01:38:09.360\nNib chips.\n\n01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:10.360\nI don't know.\n\n01:38:10.360 --> 01:38:14.360\nThat's like the worst thing you could call somebody.\n\n01:38:14.360 --> 01:38:15.360\nI don't know, man.\n\n01:38:15.360 --> 01:38:16.360\nI don't know.\n\n01:38:16.360 --> 01:38:21.360\nHonestly.\n\n01:38:21.360 --> 01:38:33.360\nWell, why don't you say it again into the microphone and then I punch him in the face.\n\n01:38:33.360 --> 01:38:34.360\nKnock him out.\n\n01:38:34.360 --> 01:38:36.360\nWell, what's your unarmed plus?\n\n01:38:36.360 --> 01:38:37.360\nOh, come on.\n\n01:38:37.360 --> 01:38:38.360\nHe's a junkie.\n\n01:38:38.360 --> 01:38:39.360\nIt's a.\n\n01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:42.360\nWell, you're, you know, you might not be a brawler by trade.\n\n01:38:42.360 --> 01:38:43.360\nWell, I stun baton.\n\n01:38:43.360 --> 01:38:44.360\nOkay.\n\n01:38:44.360 --> 01:38:45.360\nWell, let's just say that one works.\n\n01:38:45.360 --> 01:38:48.360\nBecause you're touching him and it's a taser.\n\n01:38:48.360 --> 01:38:49.360\nIt works.\n\n01:38:49.360 --> 01:38:50.360\nYeah.\n\n01:38:50.360 --> 01:38:52.360\nHe goes down to the floor.\n\n01:38:52.360 --> 01:38:53.360\nOkay.\n\n01:38:53.360 --> 01:38:56.360\nI run back to my comrades to the sound of bullets.\n\n01:38:56.360 --> 01:38:57.360\nWhat the hell?\n\n01:38:57.360 --> 01:39:03.360\nIs this a private party or am I invited?\n\n01:39:03.360 --> 01:39:06.360\nI just dashed a close one here night blade, but it looks like the bullets have run out.\n\n01:39:06.360 --> 01:39:09.360\nI leave you guys alone for five minutes.\n\n01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:10.360\nYeah, we didn't ask you to.\n\n01:39:10.360 --> 01:39:12.360\nWe were pretty happy with that guy leaving.\n\n01:39:12.360 --> 01:39:14.360\nWe heard what you did over there.\n\n01:39:14.360 --> 01:39:16.360\nI'm a completist.\n\n01:39:16.360 --> 01:39:22.360\nI examine the room for other like ways to get out other doors behind behind the barrels.\n\n01:39:22.360 --> 01:39:24.360\nYou see another secret door.\n\n01:39:24.360 --> 01:39:25.360\nGod damn it.\n\n01:39:25.360 --> 01:39:27.360\nI examine the barrels.\n\n01:39:27.360 --> 01:39:31.360\nThey look to be far too clean to actually store anything.\n\n01:39:31.360 --> 01:39:32.360\nAnd there's no labels.\n\n01:39:32.360 --> 01:39:34.360\nThey look like decoy barrels.\n\n01:39:34.360 --> 01:39:38.360\nI'd like to sense to see if there's something beyond the barrels that we are not missing.\n\n01:39:38.360 --> 01:39:41.360\nYou just sense that door other than that.\n\n01:39:41.360 --> 01:39:42.360\nYou're not sense and nothing.\n\n01:39:42.360 --> 01:39:43.360\nDammit.\n\n01:39:43.360 --> 01:39:50.360\nWell, it looks like he's not here.\n\n01:39:50.360 --> 01:39:53.360\nI guess we should just go home and call it a day.\n\n01:39:53.360 --> 01:39:59.360\nI guess some shadow runs don't go the way you want them.\n\n01:39:59.360 --> 01:40:04.360\nClomp, clomp, clomp.\n\n01:40:04.360 --> 01:40:05.360\nWe all...\n\n01:40:05.360 --> 01:40:10.360\nCan I examine the barrels to see if I can open them or see what's beneath them?\n\n01:40:10.360 --> 01:40:13.360\nThe barrels were just hiding the gun, I think.\n\n01:40:13.360 --> 01:40:16.360\nI think those were just like decoy barrels to hide the weapon that almost killed me.\n\n01:40:16.360 --> 01:40:17.360\nYeah, that's what's under them.\n\n01:40:17.360 --> 01:40:18.360\nThere's nothing in them.\n\n01:40:18.360 --> 01:40:23.360\nActually, you can feel and by touching them, they're actually completely hollow and they're probably not holding anything.\n\n01:40:23.360 --> 01:40:27.360\nI listen at the door and see if I can hear anything on the other side.\n\n01:40:27.360 --> 01:40:28.360\nYou hear nothing.\n\n01:40:28.360 --> 01:40:30.360\nIs there a handle, a doorknob?\n\n01:40:30.360 --> 01:40:32.360\nNope, neither.\n\n01:40:32.360 --> 01:40:33.360\nNightblade.\n\n01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:36.360\nUse your strength and knock this fucker down.\n\n01:40:36.360 --> 01:40:40.360\nAll right.\n\n01:40:40.360 --> 01:40:49.360\nChim Chiminy.\n\n01:40:49.360 --> 01:40:53.360\nI used my... I kicked the secret door.\n\n01:40:53.360 --> 01:40:55.360\nThat's the door, right?\n\n01:40:55.360 --> 01:40:56.360\nYeah.\n\n01:40:56.360 --> 01:40:57.360\nThat's like a seam.\n\n01:40:57.360 --> 01:40:58.360\nI'm not going to kick it.\n\n01:40:58.360 --> 01:40:59.360\nIt's the future.\n\n01:40:59.360 --> 01:41:01.360\nIt's not made of wood.\n\n01:41:01.360 --> 01:41:06.360\nI hurt my foot, which is probably also metal.\n\n01:41:06.360 --> 01:41:09.360\nWhat would a nano whip do in a situation like this?\n\n01:41:09.360 --> 01:41:12.360\nWhat if I were to open a can of nano whip?\n\n01:41:12.360 --> 01:41:15.360\nNice, delicious nano whip topping.\n\n01:41:15.360 --> 01:41:19.360\nI stand back in case things go wrong.\n\n01:41:19.360 --> 01:41:20.360\nAll right.\n\n01:41:20.360 --> 01:41:21.360\nThey do not.\n\n01:41:21.360 --> 01:41:25.360\nYou slice open the door, revealing daylight outside.\n\n01:41:25.360 --> 01:41:27.360\nWell, evening light outside.\n\n01:41:27.360 --> 01:41:30.360\nIt's just the compound that leads to the out of doors.\n\n01:41:30.360 --> 01:41:33.360\nThere's a fence with all sorts of holes and stuff.\n\n01:41:33.360 --> 01:41:38.360\nIt looks like he must have booked it out of there.\n\n01:41:38.360 --> 01:41:40.360\nNo, you're not.\n\n01:41:40.360 --> 01:41:43.360\nBig bulb and brown fence.\n\n01:41:43.360 --> 01:41:45.360\nHe's rooting for the bad guy.\n\n01:41:45.360 --> 01:41:52.360\nI look outside of the hole onto the street to see if there's any sign, crumbs, footprints.\n\n01:41:52.360 --> 01:41:56.360\nThere are footprints leading to a specific hole in the fence,\n\n01:41:56.360 --> 01:42:00.360\nbut they go right to a sidewalk street outside the fence.\n\n01:42:00.360 --> 01:42:04.360\nSo it's like he's going to a sidewalk and then all traces vanish.\n\n01:42:04.360 --> 01:42:09.360\nCan you look around and see if he's sensed anywhere?\n\n01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:10.360\nYou're reading my mind.\n\n01:42:10.360 --> 01:42:11.360\nI thought it was my gig.\n\n01:42:11.360 --> 01:42:12.360\nNice.\n\n01:42:12.360 --> 01:42:17.360\nYes, I was going to ask if I could sense where he went from this hole in the cell fence.\n\n01:42:17.360 --> 01:42:18.360\nI don't think so.\n\n01:42:18.360 --> 01:42:21.360\nI don't think you have any senses like that.\n\n01:42:21.360 --> 01:42:29.360\nI'm going to go to the man that was knocked out by Nightblade.\n\n01:42:29.360 --> 01:42:31.360\nWhich one, I guess, right?\n\n01:42:31.360 --> 01:42:33.360\nThe one that was out in the end.\n\n01:42:33.360 --> 01:42:36.360\nThe one that looks the least unconscious.\n\n01:42:36.360 --> 01:42:37.360\nOkay.\n\n01:42:37.360 --> 01:42:39.360\nYou find one that's semi-conscious.\n\n01:42:39.360 --> 01:42:40.360\nOkay.\n\n01:42:40.360 --> 01:42:48.360\nUsing my charisma and persuasion, I lift up his face.\n\n01:42:48.360 --> 01:42:51.360\nHey honey, hey, hey.\n\n01:42:51.360 --> 01:42:52.360\nHey.\n\n01:42:52.360 --> 01:42:53.360\nHey, are you okay?\n\n01:42:53.360 --> 01:42:56.360\nI got shocked.\n\n01:42:56.360 --> 01:42:57.360\nI know that's hard.\n\n01:42:57.360 --> 01:43:00.360\nThat's hard when that happens.\n\n01:43:00.360 --> 01:43:02.360\nI'm here to help you.\n\n01:43:02.360 --> 01:43:03.360\nI'm an angel.\n\n01:43:03.360 --> 01:43:04.360\nOh good.\n\n01:43:04.360 --> 01:43:05.360\nYeah.\n\n01:43:05.360 --> 01:43:11.360\nHey, we're trying to find your friend Baldwin.\n\n01:43:11.360 --> 01:43:14.360\nIt's really important that you tell us where he is.\n\n01:43:14.360 --> 01:43:17.360\nCan you tell me anything about where he stays or any hideouts, sweetie?\n\n01:43:17.360 --> 01:43:18.360\nJust here.\n\n01:43:18.360 --> 01:43:19.360\nHe was just here.\n\n01:43:19.360 --> 01:43:20.360\nYeah.\n\n01:43:20.360 --> 01:43:23.360\nDoes he have any restaurants he likes?\n\n01:43:23.360 --> 01:43:25.360\nDo you know where he lives?\n\n01:43:25.360 --> 01:43:27.360\nNo, I barely know him.\n\n01:43:27.360 --> 01:43:29.360\nI just buy drugs off the guy.\n\n01:43:29.360 --> 01:43:30.360\nOh honey.\n\n01:43:30.360 --> 01:43:35.360\nI smack him in the face and move to the next one.\n\n01:43:35.360 --> 01:43:41.360\nI summon an eagle to fly through the sky to see if we can see any sign of Baldwin on escape.\n\n01:43:41.360 --> 01:43:42.360\nAll right.\n\n01:43:42.360 --> 01:43:44.360\nWhat's your conjuring plus magic there?\n\n01:43:44.360 --> 01:43:49.360\nFirst, I activate my spirit focus for spirits of air, which gives me an extra thing.\n\n01:43:49.360 --> 01:43:52.360\nAnd then my conjuring is...\n\n01:43:52.360 --> 01:43:53.360\nIt's summoning.\n\n01:43:53.360 --> 01:43:55.360\nIt's five plus what?\n\n01:43:55.360 --> 01:43:56.360\nMagic.\n\n01:43:56.360 --> 01:43:58.360\nSo 11 plus two.\n\n01:43:58.360 --> 01:43:59.360\nThat's 13.\n\n01:43:59.360 --> 01:44:00.360\nYep.\n\n01:44:00.360 --> 01:44:01.360\nYou summon...\n\n01:44:01.360 --> 01:44:04.360\nWait, what force spirit do you want to summon?\n\n01:44:04.360 --> 01:44:05.360\nAn eagle.\n\n01:44:05.360 --> 01:44:06.360\nNo, what force?\n\n01:44:06.360 --> 01:44:07.360\nPick a number.\n\n01:44:07.360 --> 01:44:08.360\nForce four.\n\n01:44:08.360 --> 01:44:09.360\nAll right.\n\n01:44:09.360 --> 01:44:10.360\nAll right.\n\n01:44:10.360 --> 01:44:13.360\nYou take four drain damage as it comes into the ether.\n\n01:44:13.360 --> 01:44:19.360\nIt's an exerting work pulling multiple spirits to the metaphysical, the regular physical.\n\n01:44:19.360 --> 01:44:21.360\nI thought my other spirit went away.\n\n01:44:21.360 --> 01:44:22.360\nIt sure did, Dan.\n\n01:44:22.360 --> 01:44:23.360\nNot Dan.\n\n01:44:23.360 --> 01:44:24.360\nJeff.\n\n01:44:24.360 --> 01:44:26.360\nIt sure did, Jeff.\n\n01:44:26.360 --> 01:44:28.360\nYou don't even know the difference between us.\n\n01:44:28.360 --> 01:44:29.360\nI don't know.\n\n01:44:29.360 --> 01:44:31.360\nWhy is that possible spirits?\n\n01:44:31.360 --> 01:44:34.360\nI just took a lot of drain on that eagle.\n\n01:44:34.360 --> 01:44:35.360\nYep.\n\n01:44:35.360 --> 01:44:36.360\nAll right.\n\n01:44:36.360 --> 01:44:38.360\nI look at the eagle and I'm a little woozy and I say eagle, fly.\n\n01:44:38.360 --> 01:44:39.360\nLook for Baldwin Brown.\n\n01:44:39.360 --> 01:44:41.360\nHe's a balding guy who looks like this and that and whatever.\n\n01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:44.360\nTake it to the sky and see if you can find an eagle.\n\n01:44:44.360 --> 01:44:46.360\nI will, leave.\n\n01:44:46.360 --> 01:44:49.360\nCan we have the voice of the eagle be the drunk guy over there?\n\n01:44:49.360 --> 01:44:51.360\nIt's just like, could he just be...\n\n01:44:51.360 --> 01:44:53.360\nYou didn't like my voice, but I did.\n\n01:44:53.360 --> 01:44:54.360\nWhat is that we did?\n\n01:44:54.360 --> 01:44:55.360\nI want to do my voice.\n\n01:44:55.360 --> 01:44:56.360\nOh, sorry.\n\n01:44:56.360 --> 01:44:57.360\nSorry.\n\n01:44:57.360 --> 01:44:58.360\nYeah, do your voice.\n\n01:44:58.360 --> 01:44:59.360\nYou served my eagle voices?\n\n01:44:59.360 --> 01:45:00.360\nOh, I'm sorry, Jeff.\n\n01:45:00.360 --> 01:45:01.360\nI don't want to.\n\n01:45:01.360 --> 01:45:04.360\nYou already made my other spirit a fart the other day.\n\n01:45:04.360 --> 01:45:05.360\nYou made it a fart?\n\n01:45:05.360 --> 01:45:06.360\nNo, I didn't make it a fart.\n\n01:45:06.360 --> 01:45:08.360\nIt was a spirit of wind.\n\n01:45:08.360 --> 01:45:09.360\nSorry.\n\n01:45:09.360 --> 01:45:12.360\nWhile this stuff is happening also, I'm going to...\n\n01:45:12.360 --> 01:45:16.360\nFor my part, I'm going to go see if I can gather from the crates\n\n01:45:16.360 --> 01:45:18.360\nwhere those junkies were headed.\n\n01:45:18.360 --> 01:45:23.360\nI'm going to try to pick up the secondary goal,\n\n01:45:23.360 --> 01:45:25.360\nwhich is gather as many of these BTL chips.\n\n01:45:25.360 --> 01:45:26.360\nAll right.\n\n01:45:26.360 --> 01:45:28.360\nThere's way too many chips.\n\n01:45:28.360 --> 01:45:33.360\nAlso, the spirit takes off quickly to follow your instructions.\n\n01:45:33.360 --> 01:45:34.360\nNightplay, I think there's a...\n\n01:45:34.360 --> 01:45:35.360\nIsn't there a truck in there?\n\n01:45:35.360 --> 01:45:38.360\nThere's two semi-trucks and there's just multiple dozens of crates.\n\n01:45:38.360 --> 01:45:41.360\nWe might be able to load up these trucks and take them out that way.\n\n01:45:41.360 --> 01:45:42.360\nYeah.\n\n01:45:42.360 --> 01:45:43.360\nThat's what I was thinking.\n\n01:45:43.360 --> 01:45:47.360\nOkay, so while the spirit is out scouting around,\n\n01:45:47.360 --> 01:45:51.360\nlet's find as many crates as the BTLs and load these trucks up.\n\n01:45:51.360 --> 01:45:52.360\nI'll do it.\n\n01:45:52.360 --> 01:45:53.360\nYou do that.\n\n01:45:53.360 --> 01:45:55.360\nYou load up 12...\n\n01:45:55.360 --> 01:46:00.360\nNo, 25 BTL boxes onto the semi-truck.\n\n01:46:00.360 --> 01:46:01.360\nAll right.\n\n01:46:01.360 --> 01:46:05.360\nOkay, I'm at the next guy.\n\n01:46:05.360 --> 01:46:06.360\nAll right.\n\n01:46:06.360 --> 01:46:09.360\nAnd

different.\n\n01:46:13.360 --> 01:46:14.360\nAll right.\n\n01:46:14.360 --> 01:46:15.360\nWhat's your con plus charisma?\n\n01:46:15.360 --> 01:46:18.360\nMy con is nine.\n\n01:46:18.360 --> 01:46:21.360\nWell, it says six and then in parentheses, nine.\n\n01:46:21.360 --> 01:46:23.360\nAnd my charisma is seven.\n\n01:46:23.360 --> 01:46:24.360\nAll right.\n\n01:46:24.360 --> 01:46:25.360\nOkay.\n\n01:46:25.360 --> 01:46:26.360\nAll right.\n\n01:46:26.360 --> 01:46:27.360\nWhat are you saying?\n\n01:46:27.360 --> 01:46:28.360\nHey.\n\n01:46:28.360 --> 01:46:29.360\nHey,

fuck up.\n\n01:46:34.360 --> 01:46:35.360\nWell, that's intimidation, though.\n\n01:46:35.360 --> 01:46:36.360\nOh, sorry.\n\n01:46:36.360 --> 01:46:37.360\nWell, okay.\n\n01:46:37.360 --> 01:46:38.360\nSorry, sorry.\n\n01:46:38.360 --> 01:46:39.360\nHey.\n\n01:46:39.360 --> 01:46:41.360\nHey, do you know, do you know where your mom is?\n\n01:46:41.360 -->

01:46:55.360\nNo.\n\n01:46:55.360 --> 01:46:58.360\nNo, he's not at the bar.\n\n01:46:58.360 --> 01:46:59.360\nOh, fuck.\n\n01:46:59.360 --> 01:47:08.360\nYour, your dad is on the other side of town facing a rat king.\n\n01:47:08.360 --> 01:47:12.360\nTails are a metal.\n\n01:47:12.360 --> 01:47:18.360\nWe've tied him up and he's almost dead motherfucker.\n\n01:47:18.360 --> 01:47:20.360\nJust like you get your fucking life together.\n\n01:47:20.360 --> 01:47:22.360\nNow where's Baldwin and I'll save your dad.\n\n01:47:22.360 --> 01:47:23.360\nI don't know.\n\n01:47:23.360 --> 01:47:26.360\nI got knocked out early.\n\n01:47:26.360 --> 01:47:27.360\nI slap him.\n\n01:47:27.360 --> 01:47:28.360\nTell me anything.\n\n01:47:28.360 --> 01:47:31.360\nI, I, I wet my bed.\n\n01:47:31.360 --> 01:47:33.360\nFucking dumb piece of shit.\n\n01:47:33.360 --> 01:47:34.360\nTell me something about Baldwin.\n\n01:47:34.360 --> 01:47:35.360\nGive me a picture.\n\n01:47:35.360 --> 01:47:37.360\nYeah, I got a, here, here.\n\n01:47:37.360 --> 01:47:39.360\nI, I don't, why is this in my pocket?\n\n01:47:39.360 --> 01:47:41.360\nI have a picture of him right here.\n\n01:47:41.360 --> 01:47:42.360\nUh.\n\n01:47:42.360 --> 01:47:46.360\nHe hands you a picture.\n\n01:47:46.360 --> 01:47:47.360\nThanks.\n\n01:47:47.360 --> 01:47:51.360\nI, I take the picture and I, and I put it, put it in my pocket.\n\n01:47:51.360 --> 01:47:52.360\nI, uh.\n\n01:47:52.360 --> 01:47:56.360\nJust don't kill my dad.\n\n01:47:56.360 --> 01:47:58.360\nAll

tracking tags.\n\n01:48:05.360 --> 01:48:14.360\nAnd I, and I open his jaw and I stuff it in his mouth and I close his mouth and I say,\n\n01:48:14.360 --> 01:48:18.360\nmy name is Mercy O'Donnell motherfucker.\n\n01:48:18.360 --> 01:48:25.360\nI got eyes like diamonds, but they sharp.\n\n01:48:25.360 --> 01:48:30.360\nOh, okay.\n\n01:48:30.360 --> 01:48:33.360\nKaren McAfee everybody.\n\n01:48:33.360 --> 01:48:34.360\nAll right.\n\n01:48:34.360 --> 01:48:36.360\nI guess she.\n\n01:48:36.360 --> 01:48:43.360\nI didn't know it was that easy.\n\n01:48:43.360 --> 01:48:48.360\nI didn't know you could do that.\n\n01:48:48.360 --> 01:48:51.360\nSo the beauty of the imagination down.\n\n01:48:51.360 --> 01:48:52.360\nNo.\n\n01:48:52.360 --> 01:48:53.360\nYou, what?\n\n01:48:53.360 --> 01:48:54.360\nOkay.\n\n01:48:54.360 --> 01:48:56.360\nI mean, does she die when that happens?\n\n01:48:56.360 --> 01:48:58.360\nLike, is it like, it's like a Bruce Willis surrogate.\n\n01:48:58.360 --> 01:48:59.360\nIt just goes.\n\n01:48:59.360 --> 01:49:00.360\nSorry.\n\n01:49:00.360 --> 01:49:01.360\nAll right.\n\n01:49:01.360 --> 01:49:14.360\nWe're all going through stuff.\n\n01:49:14.360 --> 01:49:15.360\nWe're all grieving.\n\n01:49:15.360 --> 01:49:17.360\nWe all grieve in different ways.\n\n01:49:17.360 --> 01:49:20.360\nSo all that work, you got, you got a picture of a guy that we already know what he looks\n\n01:49:20.360 --> 01:49:21.360\nlike.\n\n01:49:21.360 --> 01:49:23.360\nWell, you didn't know exactly.\n\n01:49:23.360 --> 01:49:25.360\nDidn't we see him on a screen?\n\n01:49:25.360 --> 01:49:26.360\nWe saw him on a screen.\n\n01:49:26.360 --> 01:49:27.360\nI don't know.\n\n01:49:27.360 --> 01:49:28.360\nMaybe.\n\n01:49:28.360 --> 01:49:29.360\nMaybe.\n\n01:49:29.360 --> 01:49:30.360\nYeah.\n\n01:49:30.360 --> 01:49:32.360\nWhile back, our contact, our Mr. Johnson showed him.\n\n01:49:32.360 --> 01:49:33.360\nWell, so I look at the picture.\n\n01:49:33.360 --> 01:49:34.360\nIs he doing anything in the picture?\n\n01:49:34.360 --> 01:49:37.360\nLike standing in front of his mailbox or the mattress or anything?\n\n01:49:37.360 --> 01:49:41.360\nYou know, the pictures that we all carry with us and give to people.\n\n01:49:41.360 --> 01:49:45.360\nNo, he's just, it's like, it's, it's the interior of a bathroom.\n\n01:49:45.360 --> 01:49:46.360\nOh, okay.\n\n01:49:46.360 --> 01:49:49.360\nCan I use perception to know where that bathroom is?\n\n01:49:49.360 --> 01:49:52.360\nAnd what is he doing in the bathroom?\n\n01:49:52.360 --> 01:49:57.360\nHe's just taking a picture in the mirror, selfie stuff.\n\n01:49:57.360 --> 01:50:00.360\nWhat, what's your perception plus intuition?\n\n01:50:00.360 --> 01:50:01.360\nI'm so sorry.\n\n01:50:01.360 --> 01:50:04.360\nI took my folder and I left it in the green room.\n\n01:50:04.360 --> 01:50:07.360\nWell, you can't find out where his bathroom is located then.\n\n01:50:07.360 --> 01:50:08.360\nOkay.\n\n01:50:08.360 --> 01:50:09.360\nThat's fair.\n\n01:50:09.360 --> 01:50:10.360\nNo, that's fair.\n\n01:50:10.360 --> 01:50:11.360\nThat's fair.\n\n01:50:11.360 --> 01:50:12.360\nI don't think you could anyway to be fair.\n\n01:50:12.360 --> 01:50:13.360\nYeah.\n\n01:50:13.360 --> 01:50:15.360\nI mean, even if you saw really well.\n\n01:50:15.360 --> 01:50:16.360\nOkay.\n\n01:50:16.360 --> 01:50:21.360\nIt was worth how empowered I felt for the 30 seconds this, this embarrassment right now.\n\n01:50:21.360 --> 01:50:23.360\nSo the semi trucks all loaded up.\n\n01:50:23.360 --> 01:50:25.360\nThe spirit hasn't come back.\n\n01:50:25.360 --> 01:50:27.360\nIt's only been about five minutes.\n\n01:50:27.360 --> 01:50:32.360\nAnybody got a class C license?\n\n01:50:32.360 --> 01:50:33.360\nI never learned how to drive.\n\n01:50:33.360 --> 01:50:37.360\nI live in the woods for so long.\n\n01:50:37.360 --> 01:50:39.360\nIt's class C trucks.\n\n01:50:39.360 --> 01:50:40.360\nNo, that's normal style.\n\n01:50:40.360 --> 01:50:41.360\nThat's normal, isn't it?\n\n01:50:41.360 --> 01:50:42.360\nYeah.\n\n01:50:42.360 --> 01:50:44.360\nSo class A is like, is that a snowmobile or is that a...\n\n01:50:44.360 --> 01:50:50.360\nI think class B is small trucks and then class A is like all the cool trucks and the hover cars.\n\n01:50:50.360 --> 01:50:54.360\nDoes hardware help with that or software?\n\n01:50:54.360 --> 01:50:56.360\nNo, it would just be driving.\n\n01:50:56.360 --> 01:50:57.360\nYeah.\n\n01:50:57.360 --> 01:50:58.360\nOh.\n\n01:50:58.360 --> 01:51:00.360\nI ain't got that.\n\n01:51:00.360 --> 01:51:02.360\nI think horticard knows how to drive.\n\n01:51:02.360 --> 01:51:03.360\nHorticard.\n\n01:51:03.360 --> 01:51:04.360\nDriving?\n\n01:51:04.360 --> 01:51:05.360\nNo.\n\n01:51:05.360 --> 01:51:06.360\nHold on.\n\n01:51:08.360 --> 01:51:09.360\nHosh.\n\n01:51:09.360 --> 01:51:12.360\nI don't know if I like this guy or if I don't like this guy.\n\n01:51:12.360 --> 01:51:14.360\nI don't think I do.\n\n01:51:14.360 --> 01:51:16.360\nI don't think I like him.\n\n01:51:16.360 --> 01:51:17.360\nNope.\n\n01:51:17.360 --> 01:51:18.360\nThe answer is no.\n\n01:51:18.360 --> 01:51:20.360\nThe island has voted you off, sir.\n\n01:51:20.360 --> 01:51:22.360\nIt's on this page.\n\n01:51:22.360 --> 01:51:23.360\nIs it?\n\n01:51:23.360 --> 01:51:24.360\nAll right.\n\n01:51:24.360 --> 01:51:25.360\nLet's just pretend you can.\n\n01:51:25.360 --> 01:51:26.360\nAll right.\n\n01:51:26.360 --> 01:51:27.360\nWhere are we going to drive to?\n\n01:51:27.360 --> 01:51:29.360\nI volunteered to drive the truck.\n\n01:51:29.360 --> 01:51:30.360\nClass C you said.\n\n01:51:30.360 --> 01:51:32.360\nOne of us can certainly drive a truck.\n\n01:51:32.360 --> 01:51:33.360\nYeah.\n\n01:51:33.360 --> 01:51:34.360\nHorticard can.\n\n01:51:34.360 --> 01:51:35.360\nOkay.\n\n01:51:35.360 --> 01:51:36.360\nAll right.\n\n01:51:36.360 --> 01:51:37.360\nBut before you can...\n\n01:51:37.360 --> 01:51:38.360\nYeah.\n\n01:51:38.360 --> 01:51:39.360\nYou have ground pilot.\n\n01:51:39.360 --> 01:51:40.360\nIs that driving?\n\n01:51:40.360 --> 01:51:41.360\nYep.\n\n01:51:41.360 --> 01:51:42.360\nGround pilot.\n\n01:51:42.360 --> 01:51:43.360\nThat's the same?\n\n01:51:43.360 --> 01:51:44.360\nThank you.\n\n01:51:44.360 --> 01:51:45.360\nThank you, Mercy.\n\n01:51:45.360 --> 01:51:46.360\nOh, it's not a hover car.\n\n01:51:46.360 --> 01:51:49.360\nNo, I'm going to sit on my high floor.\n\n01:51:54.360 --> 01:51:56.360\nI'm going to sit with Mercy.\n\n01:51:57.360 --> 01:51:58.360\nThat's nuts.\n\n01:51:58.360 --> 01:51:59.360\nBut that's a chatter.\n\n01:51:59.360 --> 01:52:00.360\nOkay.\n\n01:52:00.360 --> 01:52:02.360\nAre you guys actually doing space work with the...\n\n01:52:02.360 --> 01:52:03.360\nNow you're in the truck?\n\n01:52:03.360 --> 01:52:04.360\nYeah.\n\n01:52:04.360 --> 01:52:05.360\nI'm in the truck.\n\n01:52:05.360 --> 01:52:06.360\nOkay.\n\n01:52:06.360 --> 01:52:07.360\nI'm driving as a Class C truck.\n\n01:52:07.360 --> 01:52:08.360\nThat's what you wanted from me, isn't it?\n\n01:52:08.360 --> 01:52:09.360\nI'm in the back.\n\n01:52:09.360 --> 01:52:10.360\nSo there's like a split screen.\n\n01:52:10.360 --> 01:52:12.360\nI'm on the back too.\n\n01:52:12.360 --> 01:52:16.360\nSo her ground pilot is four.\n\n01:52:16.360 --> 01:52:18.360\nGround pilot is four and...\n\n01:52:18.360 --> 01:52:19.360\nAnd the...\n\n01:52:19.360 --> 01:52:20.360\nI'm sorry, what was the other thing?\n\n01:52:20.360 --> 01:52:21.360\nInitiative?\n\n01:52:21.360 --> 01:52:22.360\nInitiative?\n\n01:52:22.360 --> 01:52:23.360\nOh, no.\n\n01:52:23.360 --> 01:52:24.360\nNo.\n\n01:52:24.360 --> 01:52:25.360\nJust
