00:00.000 --> 00:26.000
Welcome to the stage of the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.

00:26.000 --> 00:33.000
On the day long ago, you were doing your thing.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
Oh shit, I came in over here.

00:35.000 --> 00:41.000
Pink, high, high, cool, Oscar night, Harmontown gonna be alright.

00:41.000 --> 00:45.000
Family, chop, chop, chip in your chop, hip hop to the stop.

00:45.000 --> 00:49.000
Family, Oscar night, red carpet out of sight.

00:49.000 --> 00:56.000
My name's red carpet John.

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
Hey, I got my tuxedo on.

00:59.000 --> 01:06.000
I'm interviewing the stars.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
Red carpet John is a...

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
Is he any relation to MC John who mows the lawn?

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
Of course.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
It's probably the same guy.

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
Is he related? It's the same guy in a jacket.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
Now explain this to me Dan.

01:21.000 --> 01:27.000
You go through the effort of putting on a tuxedo and you don't bother to button your clip on bow tie.

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
It's more about physics.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
It's more about what can be done.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
I believe I bought this tux.

01:35.000 --> 01:40.000
The first Oscars I actually, or Emmys or something I got to go to, I think...

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
I fluctuate weights a little bit.

01:43.000 --> 01:47.000
You don't know when a shirt's gonna be able to button or not.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
It was the shirt. You couldn't get the shirt closed.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
Yeah, it's actually the shirt. The bow tie actually doesn't go around anything.

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
It's just as you know.

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
Family!

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
Did you watch anything Oscars, Harmont?

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
Yeah, we watched a little bit. I liked the opening.

02:03.000 --> 02:07.000
The opening, you know, it's NPH so he's coming out.

02:07.000 --> 02:14.000
We know what they're going after. They're going after the Hugh Jackman Oscars that I wrote.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
They're pursuing that.

02:17.000 --> 02:21.000
We know. I won an Emmy for writing those Oscars.

02:21.000 --> 02:25.000
Look it up.

02:25.000 --> 02:30.000
NPH is good if you can't get Hugh. Go to him.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
Did you see the opening?

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
I did not.

02:33.000 --> 02:37.000
It was a nice... I don't know, if you can watch it.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
Did he do a song and dance?

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
Yeah, he just did a straight up song. He had humorous elements.

02:43.000 --> 02:53.000
It was a nice... It was both sincere and totally respectful of the modern world.

02:53.000 --> 03:01.000
You felt... It did a good job of making it feel like you were watching something worth watching live.

03:01.000 --> 03:05.000
As we increasingly start to ask the question, why are we watching this shit?

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
I thought it was an opener that really answered that question.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
Like, check it out. This is nice.

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
Dougie's doing his thing.

03:13.000 --> 03:18.000
They did special effects that blended the live action with the thing.

03:18.000 --> 03:24.000
In a huge kind of fuck you to Billy Crystal, they just did a kind of like...

03:24.000 --> 03:30.000
Just a little quick thrown over the shoulder, like a little visual montage of him sitting in little things.

03:30.000 --> 03:34.000
It wasn't a fuck you, I'm just saying. It was less is more.

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
It was really nice, like interplay with animation on the screen and stuff.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
At the end of it, everyone liked it, and I said...

03:41.000 --> 03:46.000
I said, eh, there's no standing ovation.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
Did you get a standing ovation?

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
Yes.

03:51.000 --> 03:55.000
And by hue, I mean you.

03:55.000 --> 03:59.000
I thought you said you, and I had no problem with it.

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
Your ears filtered out the hood part of that.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
Old you, Jackman.

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
I looked at my phone later.

04:08.000 --> 04:13.000
I didn't hear my phone beep when it beeped when I saw what time the timestamp was,

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
and it was as that thing ended.

04:15.000 --> 04:23.000
And it was a text from Rob Schrab that said, hm, no standing o.

04:23.000 --> 04:28.000
It's nice to know we're still keeping it real.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
That's the 81st Oscars. Let's see what I got in here, huh?

04:31.000 --> 04:35.000
All right, so what's the deal with Oscar Knight?

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
I mean, what is it? Some kind of gala?

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
No.

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
It just says hm, no standing o in my notes, that's it.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
I don't know what I thought was going to be in there, the Gettysburg Address.

04:47.000 --> 04:51.000
Ah, it seems like we hold some truths to be self-evident, not the Gettysburg Address.

04:51.000 --> 04:55.000
When you were at your Oscars, how many Oscars was that ago?

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
Those are the 81st, so it's got to be six years ago now.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
Did you watch it from the wings or were you out in the crowd?

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
We were watching it, I think I've told this story a lot.

05:03.000 --> 05:10.000
We were watching from a tiny old-school CRT television backstage,

05:10.000 --> 05:15.000
and it was awesome because we were in these shitty rented tuxes

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
because we didn't have time to go home,

05:17.000 --> 05:21.000
and they have this tux kind of service for all.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
There's so much crew that works on that show, so everyone's working really hard,

05:24.000 --> 05:29.000
and you get a number and you go up to this wardrobe floor

05:29.000 --> 05:33.000
and they just give you a tux for the night if you're a crew.

05:33.000 --> 05:37.000
So we had these laminates on, we had these shitty baggy tuxes on,

05:37.000 --> 05:41.000
and we were just watching from this walking closet on this little television screen,

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
watching Hugh Jackman go through the thing,

05:43.000 --> 05:48.000
and I swear I broke a bone in my foot from jumping up and down because he was nailing it.

05:48.000 --> 05:52.000
It's not a good story, it's just a really fun time in my life.

05:52.000 --> 05:57.000
Once in a while, Ben Schwartz, now it seems funny that he was one of the three musketeers

05:57.000 --> 06:01.000
because now he's like a famous actor on Parks and Rec,

06:01.000 --> 06:07.000
and of course House of Lies with Don Cheadle.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
Is that the name of that show?

06:09.000 --> 06:16.000
Every once in a while, he'll email a photo of Bruce Valanche sleeping in a corner or something.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
Then we took it from back then.

06:18.000 --> 06:23.000
We were just kids, we didn't know what we were doing, and Hollywood loved us for it.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
Jeff, I could go on with my Hollywood stories.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
Stop me if I haven't, I probably have.

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
I told you my story about the one time I went, right, when I met that crazy lady?

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
Yeah, yeah, a crazy lady picked you up at a bar like Midnight Cowboy.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
No, no, at the hair salon.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
And then she proceeded, yeah, I have told those stories.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
She was a crazy lady and you had to like bail out of the cab.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
Yeah, it was bad.

06:44.000 --> 06:50.000
It was very clear at like hour three that she had had pills and then the booze was like combining

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
and she halked out.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
Do you remember why she was there?

06:56.000 --> 07:01.000
She had previously been nominated for art department or something like that.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
Or like art set design or something like that.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
That must be a weird haunted life to lead.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
Do you really just get to go if you win anything?

07:07.000 --> 07:12.000
Like if you drew Shrek's balls, do you just keep going to the Oscars every year?

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
I think if you've been nominated, you're allowed to go.

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
But we were sitting way up top, like you're not down on the main floor.

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
Because even just watching it, even just having touched it a little bit, I got it.

07:21.000 --> 07:28.000
I mean, I don't know if it's jealousy or just like what it is, but it's definitely like, there's a haunted feeling.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
I want to be back there at the Kodak.

07:30.000 --> 07:34.000
The smell of grease paint.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
Here's what I want to know.

07:36.000 --> 07:41.000
Okay, so a couple of years ago, so some of you kids are young enough that you were around,

07:41.000 --> 07:46.000
like you probably don't remember that they would do the in memoriam at the Oscars.

07:46.000 --> 07:54.000
And there was a time before they told everybody, don't clap for each one.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
Especially don't clap for your favorites.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
Because they're all dead.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
See, so it's starting to get weird.

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
But it was like forever, that was just the tradition.

08:04.000 --> 08:10.000
They would just show people, you know, and then Ernest Borknine would come up and there would be like an applause break.

08:10.000 --> 08:15.000
And then they'd fly through three like, Timothy the Bone Man, Key Grip or whatever.

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
Fuck you.

08:18.000 --> 08:22.000
Did you Key Grip for Ernest Borknine? Because I don't give a fuck.

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
And then like these, you know, these rousing applause.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
But so they did away with that.

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
Probably a good move, great cultural advancement that we made.

08:30.000 --> 08:36.000
I don't know about the, and the Oscar goes to as opposed to end the winner as that seems a little empty as far as like correctness.

08:36.000 --> 08:45.000
But I do think that we evolved when someone said, let's tell him don't applaud after all the death.

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
However, now it's even weirder.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
You got these faces come up.

08:51.000 --> 08:57.000
And you know, totally, you kind of like brace yourself for Robin Williams because he's the headliner death.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
And you're like, are they going to save him for last?

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
How does this work?

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
We're always asking these morbid questions, aren't we, during these things?

09:02.000 --> 09:06.000
Because you're blending two worlds that don't belong.

09:06.000 --> 09:11.000
Presentation, entertainment and the inevitability of the corporeal world.

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
Yeah, where do you put Robin in that?

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
They put, I imagine they went alphabetically or I don't know what they did.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
I actually don't.

09:19.000 --> 09:26.000
Chronologically, in order of death.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
How did you know that?

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
Mike Nichols was last.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
Okay, all right.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
Two points to terminal line, okay.

09:35.000 --> 09:39.000
But okay, so when you're watching, Mike Nichols learned by colleague.

09:39.000 --> 09:43.000
I don't know if we say this every year, but it was a tragic year.

09:43.000 --> 09:49.000
Tragic in terms of the amount of fame that died.

09:49.000 --> 09:57.000
It's hard to honor the famous dead without feeling weird because you're like, what am I rooting for?

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
I didn't know them.

09:59.000 --> 10:06.000
So people were silent, there was no like, okay, well Robin Williams, okay, great.

10:06.000 --> 10:11.000
But for three or four people, there's always like this weird sound.

10:11.000 --> 10:16.000
You hear like this sound, come on up in a second, let me finish my point.

10:16.000 --> 10:23.000
You hear like this, it'll say Mike Nichols and then you'll just hear like two or three people,

10:23.000 --> 10:27.000
like somewhere in the back of the house.

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
So we know that that's not like Mrs. Nichols,

10:30.000 --> 10:37.000
because no one's going to express their connection to the death with applause.

10:37.000 --> 10:43.000
And we also know it's therefore a human being that knows that they're breaking rank.

10:43.000 --> 10:47.000
So it was just like the world's biggest psycho Mike Nichols fan?

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
Yeah.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
Like fuck these other dead people!

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
You go, Mike Day!

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
Who are these, it's so weird.

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
I would say somebody who's A, a huge Mike Nichols fan,

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
B, somebody who doesn't like the no applause rule.

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
Like they're like, no, I'm allowed to applaud Mike Nichols,

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
because he wrote The Graduate or whatever.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
Right, it's like some kind of weird career path.

11:07.000 --> 11:11.000
There's writers in the audience like applauding or something for Billy Wilder, I don't know.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
I don't know.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
I don't know.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
I don't know.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
I don't know.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
I don't know.

11:18.000 --> 11:22.000
Are you a little on weed that you're not invited back this year that you're not?

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
No.

11:23.000 --> 11:28.000
Look, when I was at the Oscars, I was a lowly Kepler elf backstage.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
I was honored to do my duty.

11:29.000 --> 11:33.000
I wrote a little bit of pattern for Jack Black and Jennifer Aniston,

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
and I wrote that Emmy-winning opening.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
Thank you.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
Thanks.

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
If you want to look it up, I won an Emmy for writing the Oscars,

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
which is kind of cool.

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
Can you sing a little bit of it for us?

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
You remember your favorite line from it?

11:49.000 --> 11:53.000
Everything is awesome.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
I can't remember.

11:55.000 --> 11:58.000
The Lonely Island guys were on stage tonight at the Oscars.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
Jack Black was in the opening.

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
He Kanye'd the NPH opening.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
It was kind of fun.

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
He did like a sort of pseudo Jack Black rap.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
It was fun.

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
I was wondering if they wrote that for Kanye,

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
and then got Jack to do it, and Jack said, I can't rap.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
And then they're like, well, kind of sing rap.

12:16.000 --> 12:20.000
If you watch it, I feel like we're kind of hoping that Kanye could come

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
and just watch it.

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
And we were in line in the rain, Dan.

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
We weren't late.

12:28.000 --> 12:36.000
Speaking of memoriam, it feels like weird to not mention that our friend,

12:36.000 --> 12:43.000
a friend of so many of us, Harris Wittels, is lost now.

12:43.000 --> 12:50.000
It couldn't have been a more tragic passing, totally very much just tragic,

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
just accidental.

12:52.000 --> 13:00.000
And I would like to take one moment to say to people who every time,

13:00.000 --> 13:04.000
when somebody's death involves a car,

13:04.000 --> 13:10.000
you don't divert your attention away from who the person was

13:10.000 --> 13:13.000
and whether you respect them or not,

13:13.000 --> 13:17.000
or whether you'll miss them to spend a lot of time about automobile statistics

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
and the industry and insurance and stuff.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
And here's a number you can call.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
Make sure you're insured.

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
Leave it the fuck alone.

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
Everybody takes cars everywhere every day.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
Cars kill all kinds of people.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
Writers do heroin, cocaine.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
They drink.

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
People have different addictions and struggles.

13:38.000 --> 13:41.000
They are, in addition to that, human beings.

13:41.000 --> 13:48.000
If you don't know the person and they died in a way that is symbolic for you politically,

13:48.000 --> 13:56.000
think for a second before you leave that Instagram caption or that tweet.

13:56.000 --> 14:00.000
It's not your time to work some shit out.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
It's just a guy that died.

14:03.000 --> 14:13.000
It's no more cool on God's part to kill somebody through a horrible pressing addiction

14:13.000 --> 14:18.000
than it is to kill them with an anvil or cancer or anything.

14:18.000 --> 14:22.000
It is all part of this big shitty world that we are all united in.

14:22.000 --> 14:34.000
And Harris was, if you go online and you're going to see how incredibly tragic it is

14:34.000 --> 14:37.000
that he would be taken from us at such a young age.

14:37.000 --> 14:42.000
And he was not irresponsible and he did not make bad choices.

14:42.000 --> 14:49.000
And he was very smart and very self-aware and just very, very, very funny and very,

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
like, just a good guy.

14:52.000 --> 14:55.000
And he just had a bad accident and now he's gone.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
And this is the way that life is.

14:57.000 --> 15:03.000
And so, I retweeted an article that was a really nice,

15:03.000 --> 15:12.000
trying to find the words of who was he, why was he so cool and why did we not notice.

15:12.000 --> 15:15.000
What labels to put it on, how to describe him.

15:15.000 --> 15:20.000
That's one of the nice things about this new podcast universe is you can just type in his name

15:20.000 --> 15:25.000
and you can go find him on so many podcasts telling really amazing stories

15:25.000 --> 15:30.000
about struggling with his addiction, for instance, about all kinds of things.

15:30.000 --> 15:38.000
He was a linchpin of this community and so many of us are just really, really shaken by this one.

15:38.000 --> 15:42.000
It's a tough one and you want that bargaining phase to be,

15:42.000 --> 15:45.000
okay, so let's all make up our minds, call your sponsor,

15:45.000 --> 15:48.000
put this bumper sticker on your thing and wear this ribbon.

15:48.000 --> 15:53.000
That's just bargaining and it's as healthy as denial and it's,

15:53.000 --> 15:57.000
but ultimately acceptance is the only thing that's going to be honest.

15:57.000 --> 16:00.000
Like, who gives a fuck how they died?

16:00.000 --> 16:05.000
It's not important, it's not who they were and it's not,

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
there's no such thing as a deserved death or anything like that.

16:08.000 --> 16:14.000
Just like, notice how cool the guy was, go listen to his stories.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
He was an old soul, I guess.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
I had no idea he was that young, really.

16:18.000 --> 16:22.000
That was a horrible way to find out that somebody was 30 years old.

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
I didn't know either.

16:23.000 --> 16:28.000
He was just a kid when he started to work on the Sarah Silverman show after I left.

16:28.000 --> 16:34.000
He kind of arrived there as I left to sort of fill that vacuum

16:34.000 --> 16:39.000
and he was literally a child and was just like,

16:39.000 --> 16:43.000
you can't swing a cat in the city without finding somebody

16:43.000 --> 16:49.000
that has a good story about him and now it's all laced with this stuff

16:49.000 --> 16:53.000
and there's nothing to do but grieve and accept it.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
Sports Corner!

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
No, I'm kidding, there's no sports corner.

16:57.000 --> 17:06.000
I do fight, yeah, okay.

17:06.000 --> 17:27.000
So, let's bring out Dino Stamatopoulos, who I haven't seen since he...

17:27.000 --> 17:33.000
I just want to say that I actually met Harris here once

17:33.000 --> 17:42.000
and we kind of shared a moment and I can't believe he's gone humble brag.

17:42.000 --> 17:47.000
There's a lot of humble bragging going on in the wake of his passing.

17:47.000 --> 17:52.000
You see this, I fucking peed in my pants.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
What do you mean? Tell us about it.

17:54.000 --> 18:00.000
Well, I got here and I had to pee really bad and the guy out there, he was really nice.

18:00.000 --> 18:03.000
I was like, Dan's already out there. Oh, he's out there?

18:03.000 --> 18:09.000
I don't know for some reason I felt like you ran a tight ship.

18:09.000 --> 18:13.000
What's he talking about himself? He'll need me any second.

18:13.000 --> 18:18.000
So, yeah, I went and I took a piss and I zipped up too soon.

18:18.000 --> 18:21.000
I was still peeing.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
It's a fucking nightmare.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
So, not really peeing your pants.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
No, I actually peed in my pants.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
You peed on them.

18:29.000 --> 18:32.000
Oh, you said you just had more pee to do and then you zipped up your pants and you just kept peeing.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
I just zipped them up and I kept going.

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
It was stupid.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
I don't know if I've ever done that.

18:36.000 --> 18:41.000
They say that no matter how you shake or dance, the last drop is always in your pants.

18:41.000 --> 18:45.000
That sounds like something MC John would say.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
Well, keys to the parrots and the parrots to the keys.

18:48.000 --> 18:53.000
So, I just said at Little Dom's and they put my drink to go.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
Oh, that's nice. Welcome back. I haven't seen you.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
This is the only way we can get together.

18:57.000 --> 19:00.000
I know. I know you're working a lot and I'm just drunk.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
Yeah.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
You're traveling?

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
You've been back for a couple of weeks now and I haven't seen you at all.

19:05.000 --> 19:10.000
Yeah, you go off traveling the world, Canada and Canada and Canada.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
I was in Canada.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
You were in New York working for Smigal.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
Yeah, yeah.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
On the insult comic doc show.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
Insult comic doc show.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
Is that what it's called?

19:19.000 --> 19:22.000
Yeah.

19:22.000 --> 19:26.000
It needs work, but I think it'll be okay.

19:26.000 --> 19:30.000
So, what's, compare him to me vertically?

19:30.000 --> 19:34.000
Hierarchically, in terms of talent.

19:34.000 --> 19:41.000
He, I could sneak out easier out of his show than your show.

19:41.000 --> 19:45.000
So, he's more talented.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
He doesn't notice you're gone.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
Yeah, he doesn't notice I'm gone.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
Are you sad to be back?

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
Because you were living the high life out there, man.

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
Yeah, I mean, it was ridiculous.

19:53.000 --> 19:56.000
There was a Dino out there and tell me if I'm wrong.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
You would work a little bit at the office.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
Then you would take your work away to the office.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
I barely at the office.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
I was like, you know, I can't really work here.

20:03.000 --> 20:06.000
I like working at a bar.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
And they're like, yeah, whatever works for you.

20:08.000 --> 20:11.000
And, you know, I would just get drunk and right.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
And then you would go eat French food.

20:13.000 --> 20:18.000
Yeah, and go eat French food and funk boys and girls.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
Because you were fucking everybody out there.

20:20.000 --> 20:25.000
Yeah, it turns out that everyone in fucking New York is beautiful,

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
including me apparently.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
Who would have known?

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
It was ridiculous.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
So just being in the city made you extra sexy?

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
Yeah, I don't know how.

20:34.000 --> 20:37.000
I think people go out there because they want to have an adventure.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
They want to like, I want to fuck things up.

20:39.000 --> 20:44.000
I want to, you know, deal with ugliness and shit.

20:44.000 --> 20:47.000
And then there I am.

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
Trousers soaked in your own urine.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
Yeah, urine.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
I mean, this is not going to go away tonight.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
There's that much?

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
I can't see it.

20:55.000 --> 20:56.000
Take a look at this.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.000
You see it?

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
You can see it from there.

20:58.000 --> 21:01.000
You're wearing kind of pea colored pants almost.

21:01.000 --> 21:05.000
No, these were white before I got here.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.000
Wow.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
That's a lot of pee.

21:08.000 --> 21:12.000
You got to subscribe to the live feed for stuff like that.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
You really do.

21:13.000 --> 21:17.000
I'm going to take the cap off because this scotch is too hot.

21:17.000 --> 21:22.000
If you did not subscribe to the live feed, you're really missing out on a pee stain right now.

21:22.000 --> 21:26.000
How have you guys been doing?

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
I've been doing good.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
It's really hard to write community this year.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
It's like...

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
You're doing it for the fans.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
You don't really want to write it.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
Seriously.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
Admit it.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
I...

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
Admit it.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
No.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
You really don't want to write it.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
You want to do it for the people?

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
That's admirable.

21:45.000 --> 21:52.000
I will admit that I'm not 100% sure I did it for my own joy.

21:52.000 --> 21:56.000
But the last thing I'm going to do is lay it on the fucking fans doorstep.

21:56.000 --> 21:59.000
They're watching season six and they're like, this sucks.

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
And then there's a foot and I was like, Dan says it's your fault.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
That's not what I was saying.

22:03.000 --> 22:07.000
I'm saying that you want to do it.

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
You want to do it for your family.

22:08.000 --> 22:12.000
God knows what...

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
I do feel...

22:13.000 --> 22:17.000
The other thing is you're listening to my running commentary while I'm in the process here.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
So don't...

22:19.000 --> 22:24.000
Just feel this in the moment with me because I never know what the fuck I'm talking about.

22:24.000 --> 22:28.000
But right now I feel like I am doing a horrible job.

22:28.000 --> 22:31.000
A couple weeks ago I was like, I'm a god.

22:31.000 --> 22:32.000
I did it.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.000
And then a couple weeks before that.

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
And I swear it goes because it just depends on...

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
I'll see a cut and I'll be like, oh, it's working.

22:37.000 --> 22:38.000
Okay.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
That's how God works.

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
That's why they're tsunamis.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
I fucked up.

22:46.000 --> 22:49.000
Wait, he fucks up and then does a tsunami to...

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.

22:51.000 --> 22:55.000
I was just happy I turned and you were laughing.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
And then God goes like, oh, fucking god damn it.

22:57.000 --> 23:00.000
I made too many people again.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
Tsunami time.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
I definitely just feel...

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
I feel the burn.

23:04.000 --> 23:07.000
It feels like doing a crunch.

23:07.000 --> 23:11.000
I just feel like for better or for worse, I'm working.

23:11.000 --> 23:16.000
I feel like we need to do a telethon for the fans and say lay off him.

23:16.000 --> 23:19.000
Let him not work on community for a while.

23:19.000 --> 23:22.000
I think this is a problem that solves itself.

23:22.000 --> 23:25.000
If it's a bad season, then it will kind of go away.

23:25.000 --> 23:29.000
But I think that it's just...

23:29.000 --> 23:33.000
I think if you did anything for six years, the sixth year would be like Jesus Christ.

23:33.000 --> 23:36.000
Am I in the zone?

23:36.000 --> 23:40.000
Three of the first seven characters are gone.

23:40.000 --> 23:44.000
What am I doing with the remaining four and what am I doing with the new two?

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
Am I servicing them?

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
Am I exploring them?

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
Can it ever really...

23:50.000 --> 23:53.000
I try to psych myself out and sell myself.

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
It's just a new show.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
I just dimensionalize the characters.

23:57.000 --> 24:00.000
Is that my job or am I supposed to just be telling jokes?

24:00.000 --> 24:03.000
And I don't know what I'm doing.

24:03.000 --> 24:06.000
And then I'll watch a cut and I'll be like...

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
On Tuesday, I'll be like, I did it.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
It's the best season ever.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
Can't believe it's on the internet instead of TV.

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
That's the way you do it.

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
And then on Wednesday, I'm like, I fucked up.

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
I did it real bad.

24:17.000 --> 24:20.000
I don't want to go home.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
My wife hasn't seen me.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
Now I just sleep on my couch in the office.

24:24.000 --> 24:28.000
Like last week, she saw me on Valentine's Day, which was Saturday.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
And then she saw me the following Saturday.

24:30.000 --> 24:33.000
I was slept at my office every day.

24:33.000 --> 24:36.000
You're going to stay together forever.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
That's the way to do a relationship.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
I got some pretty shitty texts.

24:44.000 --> 24:49.000
We should read our text messages to jazz music.

24:49.000 --> 24:53.000
No, I don't know what that would be.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
I don't know how that would work.

24:55.000 --> 25:01.000
Dino, on another note, can you tell the story about that couple that you told me about?

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
Oh, yeah.

25:03.000 --> 25:09.000
Well, for some reason, I go out to New York and I'm attractive.

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
I already said that.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
And it's baffling to me.

25:13.000 --> 25:18.000
And there's a 23-year-old couple and they want to have a threesome with...

25:18.000 --> 25:21.000
I guess they want to fuck their grandfather.

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
Say yours truly.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
Or their grandfather.

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
I fucked up.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
Okay, I stepped on your grandfather punchline.

25:28.000 --> 25:31.000
No, no, it wouldn't have gotten a laugh anyway.

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
But anyway...

25:32.000 --> 25:35.000
Smigol would have given you space.

25:35.000 --> 25:40.000
So, I don't know if it's a good story or not.

25:40.000 --> 25:44.000
I just...

25:44.000 --> 25:48.000
So we were going to fuck one night.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
First off, where did you meet them?

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
Like Lucian?

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
At the library bar.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
So how does it...

25:56.000 --> 26:02.000
For those of us who forgot, because it hasn't happened in a little bit...

26:02.000 --> 26:09.000
What does it sound like and look like when a couple chooses you?

26:09.000 --> 26:10.000
I'll tell you what it sounds like.

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
It sounds like the girl is going,

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
Yeah, we're really open to everything.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
We want to experiment.

26:16.000 --> 26:20.000
We want to have sex with the grossest shit in the world and all that.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
And the guy's like, you know, whatever she wants.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
It's like...

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
Well, um...

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
It's either fucked or...

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
I don't know, I mean, you know, whatever.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
How are you doing?

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
Can I buy you a drink?

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
And then...

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
Yeah.

26:38.000 --> 26:42.000
The guy obviously wasn't as into it as the girl.

26:42.000 --> 26:45.000
I'd rather hear that story, though, than the opposite.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
Where the woman is like,

26:47.000 --> 26:50.000
Hey, am I doing all right for you, Bob?

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
So...

26:52.000 --> 26:55.000
In the middle of that, I was like, well, you guys figure it out.

26:55.000 --> 26:58.000
I'm going to meet my friends and I'm going to go have dinner.

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
And they went out and they got coke.

27:00.000 --> 27:03.000
And of course, you know, I started getting texts.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
Like, my...

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
You know, for you kids out there.

27:07.000 --> 27:10.000
My phone was ringing off the hook.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
I don't know if you know what that means.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
It's an expression.

27:14.000 --> 27:17.000
Like, yeah, we're ready, we're ready, where are you?

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
And I'm like eating fucking peaking duck

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
and getting really fat and farty.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
And, uh...

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
And finally, I just said, look, I can't...

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
fart through your...

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
our threesome, you know.

27:29.000 --> 27:32.000
Uh, let's do it tomorrow after I take a shit.

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
Right?

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
Well, you guys are really turned on.

27:36.000 --> 27:39.000
Yeah, so, you know,

27:39.000 --> 27:42.000
news flash, the guy doesn't want to fuck me anymore.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
And, uh...

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
And the girl breaks up with the guy.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
Yeah.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
And...

27:50.000 --> 27:53.000
And now she wants to have a twosome.

27:53.000 --> 27:56.000
Now she wants to have a twosome for the rest of our lives.

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
And, you know, I told her.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
I was like, you know, I mean, like, come on.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
I have a kid.

28:02.000 --> 28:06.000
I have 8,000 fucking animals

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
and frogs I fuck.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
You know, I mean, I don't know.

28:10.000 --> 28:14.000
Meaning you're an untamed stallion is what...

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
Yeah, yeah, I didn't want to put it that way

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
because I'm humble.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
But, uh...

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
So, uh...

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
But, you know, then we had some good sex

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
and, you know, I have her pictures on my phone.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
You want to see them?

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
I do.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
Can we put them on the feed?

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
Yeah, I don't care.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
Our show just becomes 4chan.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
Put her address up there.

28:38.000 --> 28:42.000
You might have to, like, scroll through a few of my dicks.

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
I have...

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
Dino has 7 dicks.

28:50.000 --> 28:54.000
I got a few more since New York.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
That fucking town's full of them.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
I remember one time you were talking...

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
You were telling some story about how you had to delete

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
a couple of things on your phone to take a picture

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
because there was so much porn on it or something.

29:04.000 --> 29:08.000
My mind, you said porn, but you must have said something

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
else that was, like, ambiguous,

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
like sex movies or something.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
Because I remember...

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
I just thought...

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
I was like, really? On your phone?

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
That's interesting.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
Just for using in the bathroom?

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
No, no, I mean, you know.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
Okay, go ahead. You remember.

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
And you're like, well, yeah, I don't know.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
Whatever.

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
And I was like, well, can I see?

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
And you're like, yeah.

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
And you started playing around.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
I'm like, that's the person that I know.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
I thought you meant from the internet.

29:40.000 --> 29:44.000
I thought you meant Debbie Dallas.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
I know. I was like, well...

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
That's Natalie from marketing.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
You just thought that I was like, okay, can I see?

29:56.000 --> 30:02.000
Yeah, well, I thought Mr. Harmon from community.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
I...

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
But you're breaking so many hearts out there.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
These girls are just falling for you.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
It's not just that you're out there being promiscuous.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
They're resilient. Girls don't care.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
I mean, look at me.

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
No one's going to break their heart over me, right, girls?

30:16.000 --> 30:22.000
But I lost my phone hiking like a year ago.

30:22.000 --> 30:26.000
And that phone, God damn it, has so much shit about me.

30:26.000 --> 30:30.000
Like, like texts, like ridiculous texts

30:30.000 --> 30:34.000
and pictures of everyone and me.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
And like, you know, like, I like to take pictures

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
of my dick and my face.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
Right.

30:40.000 --> 30:44.000
Because, you know, you just don't send a dick pic with just a dick.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
You can get that anywhere.

30:46.000 --> 30:50.000
Tonight, can I get a picture of my dick in your face?

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
I always put...

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
I put, like, a newspaper headline that says,

30:54.000 --> 30:58.000
Dewey defeats Truman.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
Just because I want to remind the woman,

31:00.000 --> 31:06.000
like, don't believe everything you see.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
This was an early addition.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
Yeah, actually, when you take a picture like that

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
with your dick and then your face,

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
your dick looks huge.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
Like, it's enveloping your face.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
I've never understood it. I guess this is me...

31:18.000 --> 31:24.000
I guess this is probably a small penis thing.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
I just don't understand...

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
Take it like this?

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
No, but it's not my goal to make it look big.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
Like, that would be worse than that.

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
It would be like if Ewan McGregor was my headshot

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
and I was an actor, like,

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
oh, like, they want me to come in again?

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
Okay.

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
Um, the...

31:42.000 --> 31:46.000
Like, I don't understand the dick pic thing.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
On paper, when you hear about that,

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
you immediately think to yourself,

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
this is something that only men would think

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
that women would want.

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
No, women ask for it.

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
Like, swear to God.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
Clearly, over time, what I've learned is that

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
just by its longevity as a cultural thing,

32:02.000 --> 32:06.000
is that there is participation in this on both sides.

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
Girls will solicit a dick pic from you.

32:08.000 --> 32:12.000
Which maybe, you know, there's a length of feminism

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
you can go to to the point where you're actually,

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
like, kind of...

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
I don't know if you felt that wave of tittering

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
going through the crowd right now.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
I was thinking...

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
Every girl just remembered the last time

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
they solicited a dick pic from somebody.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
I mean, is that...

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
This is why I wish we had that, like, polling technology.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
I want to know, like, because I don't want anyone

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
to have to say out loud.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
Have them say out loud.

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
Well, the people that say out loud, then, you know,

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
what's their deal?

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
But it would be interesting to get an honest poll

32:42.000 --> 32:46.000
of, like, how many women in the audience,

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
like, have they ever said to a man

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
in one form or another in text,

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
like, send me a picture of your dick,

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
or, like, you know, something like that.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
Anybody out there? Gals?

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
One woman says, oh, yeah, for sure.

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
We heard one for sure.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
What's your name?

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
My name's Lana.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
Lana, get up here.

33:06.000 --> 33:16.000
If you want to.

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
Meet the press.

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
Chop, chop, chop.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
Well, thank you for...

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
I'm nervous, too.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
Oh, you should...

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
There's a mic next to you, Lana.

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
There's another one over here.

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
Lana was it?

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
Wow. Hello, Lana.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
Is it, like, it's just a guy you like,

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
and it's, like, I mean, I guess

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
the analog is if...

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
Yeah, I mean, it's not, like,

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
it's not, like, random.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
It's not, like, oh, hey, dude, on the street,

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
you just gave me your number.

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
It's like an extension of phone sex,

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
like, when there was only landlines,

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
like, sometimes a relationship

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
would get to the point, like,

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
very infrequently with me.

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
But, like, it's like, oh, I'm not with you,

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
and we can't be together,

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
and then you do weird things through the medium

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
that's allowed. And so now we have pictures.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
He'd have to be in your phone already, right?

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
Yes, yes, yes, of course.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
What's your number?

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
I gotta get it out, baby.

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
And so I'm assuming

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
that the way the conversation

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
probably goes is the guy

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
probably says,

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
in terms of flattering the woman,

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
like, I am in this state

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
right now, and then the woman says,

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
you know, pics or it didn't happen,

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
like, let's see it.

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
When you're

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
asking for that, did you,

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
okay, for this particular guy,

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
you had already seen the wiener

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
in question. You weren't seeing it for the first time.

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
That would be weird. That would definitely be weird.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
That would be a weird way to see it for the first time.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
It's not like you're going shopping, right?

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
No, no, no.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
But if you've already seen,

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
this is the thing about a wiener.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
If you've already seen it,

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
I guess I just need to, like, relax

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
and go like, you know what, maybe women like

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
sex too, I guess?

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
Kind of the way that men do.

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
It's kind of a way of having sex without having sex.

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
It's like having sex for a distance, right?

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
Pretty much. I mean, admittedly, I've been,

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
you know, lucky.

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
So generally, the pics I get sent

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
are fairly impressive.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
So there's the hat.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
The Eiffel Tower is in the background.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
There's a...

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
He's got his pinky out.

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
No.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
Overboard. I don't know what's...

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
It's a dick. It's a dick.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
But, Lana, you're saying that you've already seen

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
the wieners in question.

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
So you knew what you were getting more or less.

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
It wasn't going to be a picture of a guy's dick

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
shaped like an ampersand or something.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
I mean, that would be impressive, but for different reasons.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
Yeah, sure.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
Spencer's is shaped like the Dungeons & Dragons ampersand.

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
It's a dragon dick

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
that's breathing fire that forms its own...

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
Spencer's dick is an innie right now

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
after you said that.

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
Are you kidding?

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
Spencer's dick has 20 sides.

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
Also impressive.

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
Impressive for different reasons.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
Yeah.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
But every hit is critical.

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
I don't know.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
That's it.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
Don't applaud.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
I...

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
I contested that joke on the way out the door

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
and you applauded it.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
So what does that make you?

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
A very generous audience.

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
So Lana, are you currently seeing somebody right now?

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
No, actually.

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
You're out shopping for more dick pics.

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
Jeff, are you seeing anyone right now?

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
No.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
How many megapixels is your camera, Jeff?

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
Not nearly enough, Dan.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
Like 10, 10 and a half.

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
Wow.

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
Yeah.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
10 and a half nights.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
God, I wish I had a big dick.

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
So bad.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
I would show it to everybody.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
Can you remember when I took my shirt off?

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
People are impressed when you're not afraid to show.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
You ever notice our friends like Chris Romano

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
and actually Harris Wittels was one of them?

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
Like, for a joke,

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
they would just whip...

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
If Sarah would ask,

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
they would just...

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
They're just naked. They're putting their balls in the coffee, whatever.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
But they...

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
They look and they go,

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
my dick's smaller than that. That's why they're doing that.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
So they had like a big dick flaccid?

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
Well, yeah, I think that's what it's like.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
As I've said on this show,

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
mine is in it.

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
Mine, I praise only its practicality.

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
Like...

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
When it is not in operational mode,

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
it is a nipple.

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
Well, yeah.

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
So's mine.

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
So's mine.

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
It doesn't matter back then.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
Well, it matters.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
Way back then.

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
Well, I'm married now.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
I'll send Aaron a picture of my dick

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
at some point, I guess.

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
Why would you do that?

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
Because I want to have done it.

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
You know, it's like...

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
Send it now.

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
No, no, no.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
Go into the bathroom right now.

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
Take a dick pic.

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
Oh, yeah.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
I'm not gonna...

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
This isn't the Morton Downey show.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
Yeah, yeah.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
Like a Nazi throws a chair at me.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
Well, let's bring

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
my wife out, Erin McGathy.

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
She's here.

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
Oh, yeah, yeah. Stick around

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
because I want to hear the woman's

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
conversation about it.

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
Should I leave? No, you shouldn't leave either.

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
She's got a big skirt on.

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
Oh, Aaron.

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
Wow.

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
Oscar night.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
That is a whole lot of crinoline.

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
Can we get you another chair?

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
Yes.

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
I got it.

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
It's an intimacy thing,

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
or a power thing.

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
It's dirty. On whose side is it a power thing?

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
Full size. I don't know.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
The other night when you were

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
at work,

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
I don't know why I was so nervous to send this

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
to you or my husband, but I was like,

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
I just want to ask him to take a picture

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
of his face.

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
Not as a poster.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
With Dino's dick in front of it.

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
Yeah.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
Here you go, Scoops. You want a drink?

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
Sure.

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
You pass that down to my better half.

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
AKA Scoops.

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
My little cloud baby.

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
Oh, interesting.

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
You're wearing that

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
because you saw the red carpet.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
This year is all about beards for the men

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
and white dresses with...

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
White dresses with embellishments.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
Yeah.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
So she embellished with more

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
dress than anybody.

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
This is the skirt I wore under

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
my wedding dress.

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
Uncomfortable.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
Yeah, I just wanted

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
you to send a picture of your face as a

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
I don't know, maybe part of it's

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
a power thing.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
Yeah.

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
You're having the power to make

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
your husband show a picture of his face?

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
No, no, no.

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
I'm thinking about the dick pics.

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
I'm toying with whether

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
or not to say this, so I guess I'll just say this.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
I have asked for dick pics.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
All right.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
This is at what time today?

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
Dan, when were you buying milk?

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
The moment Dan steps over that daily milk chair.

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
I was like, man, this is like,

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
why am I always buying milk?

40:58.000 --> 41:02.000
That's what the milk man's for.

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
Well, there have been a couple of times

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
when I've sent you sexy pictures of me

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
and then I felt embarrassed

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
because they're not reciprocated,

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
but it's like a bag of force.

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
They actually came to me.

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
Oh, what a gross thought.

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
That's a nightmare.

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
That is an absolute nightmare.

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
You're sitting drawing

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
Oh, okay.

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
I got to go.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
You're drawing?

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
I think you said drawing.

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
You just got out of that wet, wet bath.

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
You're in the kitchen

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
making your Greek chicken

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
and just the beads of sweat

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
are dripping off of your disgusting body

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
and pee is

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
spreading.

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
What are you wearing right now?

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
Something to cover up

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
how much we had gained.

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
I'm just kidding.

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
Oh, that's nice that you feel sorry for me,

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
which makes me feel like I'm fatter than I am.

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
No, I look great.

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
There was like a jiu-jitsu move.

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
I should send you a picture back

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
when you send me one of those pictures during the day.

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
It's just you looking cute.

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
I should send one back.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
If I send you a picture of me

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
at the library, I would like,

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
wow, so many copies of Bridget Jones' diary

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
or a picture of your penis.

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
That might

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
not be the right space for it.

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
But I would still accept it.

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
I'd like that.

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
That's better for me because I always don't know what to type,

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
so I always just go, aw.

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
That's great.

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
Sometimes you accidentally type,

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
ah.

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
Ah!

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
And then I have to

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
talk myself into it.

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
Fonzie, hey.

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
Lana.

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
So, Lana, where are you from?

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
New York? Living out here now? You're visiting?

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
Oh, no.

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
I feel like we just had a threesome.

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
Weird.

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
There's one for everybody.

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
I've been out here for two and a half years.

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
It's freezing.

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
Having fun?

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
I'm a script soup, so.

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
Script soup?

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
So, you know, this is

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
LA's little place to be for it, I guess.

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
What's in that bottle at your brown bag

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
and like a cholo from my high school?

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
This is, what is this?

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
Liquid aloha from Longport?

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
I don't know. It was the only thing

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
that wasn't like a horrible, heavy stout.

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
Oh, it's beer.

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
It's definitely beer.

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
My friend is drinking Straight Up Kettle One though,

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
so there is that.

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
It's a little bit more hardcore than me.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
But, yeah.

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
Let me finish that. Are you fucking him?

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
No, no.

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
Have you seen the guy?

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
Is that your significant fellow there?

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
No, no. He's a friend of mine visiting.

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
Are you dating that guy?

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
I am not. I don't know.

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
What's your name with this, sir?

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
Brett? Did you know you were insignificant?

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
No.

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
Well, Erin, you brought,

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
did you bring an activity, an Oscar night activity?

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
I did. Everybody look under your chairs.

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
There are three colored pens. Oh, that's so nice.

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
I'm kidding.

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
So cute. You're cute. You're so cute.

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
That is so sweet.

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
That is really sweet.

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
That reminds me of when I was nine years old.

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
My dad was a preacher and he let me have...

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
You guys are nine years old.

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
He let me have...

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
I asked one day if I could get up and talk for the church,

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
and this is the first and last time he let me do this.

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
I came in early and I took bags of glitter

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
and taped them underneath all the chairs

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
to...

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
Because I wanted to tell a story.

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
I had just read the story or heard the story

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
of a Meshack,

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
Reshack and a Bendigo.

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
Shadrack Meshack.

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
Yeah, Shadrack Meshack.

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
I mean, it really stuck with me.

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
They were protected by an angel and they lived through a fire

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
and so I had this orange glitter

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
and everybody reached under their chair

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
and brought out the thing and then got glitter all over them.

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
And I told the story.

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
Do you remember when we were preparing for the wedding

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
and my dad was like, don't give her any glitter?

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
That's because of that. That's like still a thing.

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
But yes, I did read...

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
You should have said that for the honeymoon.

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
I don't know what that means.

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
You should put three specks of glitter on your penis.

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
I could probably fit three and a half.

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
Oh, no.

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
I could fit thousands, millions.

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
There's a... I do have an activity.

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
I have a little Game Corner activity.

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
I left a...

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
If someone can hand me the black book

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
that's back there.

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
Thank you.

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
I'm going to

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
read my goals for

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
2015.

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
Not really. Okay.

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
So if we could set up two mics that are facing

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
a camera that look like

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
presenter mics at the Oscars.

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
This is a game called

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
Presenters.

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
Oscars.

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
Bane.

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
Jeff, can I switch places with you

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
for this game?

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
Thank you. Jeff is wearing

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
a lovely charcoal suit.

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
I'm not sure which

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
which camera should we...

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
It makes us look like we're presenting

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
at the Oscars.

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
This one or that one?

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
That one?

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
Is your red light

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
your way of saying yes?

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
No.

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
We'll share a mic.

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
They'll share a mic.

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
All right. It is the year...

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
It is the year 2020.

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
These are the Oscars and

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
Jeff and Dan are going to be playing

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
various presenters at the Oscars.

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
Presenting

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
various awards.

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
And Dino and Lana,

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
if you feel inspired

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
at any point to be a part of this,

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
you are welcome.

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
I'm doing it now.

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
I keep one question for you.

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
Stay.

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
We're going to have the best night of our lives.

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
Welcome back

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
to the 2020 Oscars.

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
Live from the Olympia Theatre

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
in beautiful Petra B

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
63 crater

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
on the dark side of the moon.

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
Presenting

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
the award for best

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
supporting actress is

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
Alan Cumming

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
and Charlie Callis.

47:46.000 --> 47:52.000
Yes!

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
Work it!

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
Best supporting actresses

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
are very important.

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
I think I'm British.

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
They're thinking about the...

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
They're thinking about the...

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
They're thinking about the...

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
They're thinking about the...

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
They're thinking about the...

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
They're thinking about the...

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
The nominees are...

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
Jody Foster

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
for her role in

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
Abadou's...

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
How come there's no Abadou's?

48:36.000 --> 48:40.000
I won't do clips for each one.

48:40.000 --> 48:43.000
for the virus in the wind.

48:43.000 --> 48:52.000
What exactly, what are you talking about?

48:52.000 --> 49:04.000
Renee Selweger and, wow.

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
The Oscar goes to...

49:06.000 --> 49:12.000
Joni Foster.

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
I think we did that wrong, right?

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
That was great.

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
And if I didn't establish this earlier,

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
they don't know who I'm going to say.

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
And also they don't know who Charlie Callas is.

49:22.000 --> 49:25.000
All right.

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
Here we go.

49:27.000 --> 49:30.000
You saw it was a very outgoing Charlie Callas.

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
Please welcome to the stage,

49:32.000 --> 49:38.000
you know him from filling in that smaller crater.

49:38.000 --> 49:43.000
And you know her as president of the dark side of the moon,

49:43.000 --> 49:53.000
Alec Baldwin and Oprah Winfrey.

49:53.000 --> 50:00.000
They will be presenting best.

50:00.000 --> 50:04.000
Though they need no activity because we respect their power,

50:04.000 --> 50:08.000
they will be presenting a best original song.

50:08.000 --> 50:13.000
You know they say that the song is the heart and soul of a movie.

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
And without a song,

50:15.000 --> 50:18.000
that the movie's not really the whole experience that it ought to be.

50:18.000 --> 50:25.000
That's the worst Oprah Winfrey ever.

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
I stole this joke.

50:27.000 --> 50:41.000
I was going to say hello, I'm Oprah Winfrey.

50:41.000 --> 50:47.000
I got so depressed that I stole this joke I peed on my pants.

50:47.000 --> 50:53.000
The nominees are...

50:53.000 --> 50:58.000
All right.

50:58.000 --> 51:02.000
Later in the night, Drew Barrymore and Dakota Fanning

51:02.000 --> 51:11.000
presented the Oscar for best original screenplay.

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
I get to do the easy one.

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
That's the worst.

51:15.000 --> 51:19.000
Sorry, go ahead.

51:19.000 --> 51:25.000
The thing of Kate Hudson's impression of Drew Barrymore is what I'm doing right now.

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
And is magical.

51:27.000 --> 51:31.000
Hello, I'm Dakota Fanning.

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
What's the top, what's the nomination again?

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
What's the category?

51:35.000 --> 51:36.000
Original Screenplay.

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
Well shit, original screenplays.

51:38.000 --> 51:48.000
I'm Dakota Fanning.

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
It's the name, it's the name.

51:50.000 --> 51:54.000
I don't know what that is, it sounds like an old time cowboy actor.

51:54.000 --> 51:57.000
Oh shit, I'm Dakota Fanning.

51:57.000 --> 52:01.000
And the Oscar goes to Everybody.

52:01.000 --> 52:05.000
Finally, the night took a dramatic turn

52:05.000 --> 52:11.000
in a moment that will be forever remembered in Oscar history as the time it happened.

52:11.000 --> 52:17.000
When Billy Crystal and Benedict Cumberbatch presented best picture.

52:17.000 --> 52:23.000
Come on, Billy Crystal's dead by then, right?

52:23.000 --> 52:24.000
He's gotta be.

52:24.000 --> 52:25.000
Oh no, I thought not.

52:25.000 --> 52:28.000
No, I picture him like a future on a head in a jar.

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
Oh really, okay.

52:30.000 --> 52:46.000
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

52:46.000 --> 52:49.000
That is the worst Oprah Winfrey I've ever heard.

52:49.000 --> 52:53.000
Yay, and that was presenters.

52:53.000 --> 53:00.000
All right, that was a good segment.

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
All right, that was dynamite.

53:02.000 --> 53:03.000
That was fun, thanks.

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
Thank you for that.

53:05.000 --> 53:13.000
I just want to show everybody my opposite of a beautiful mind notes for.

53:13.000 --> 53:17.000
All right, let's make sure, is it Lana?

53:17.000 --> 53:18.000
Lana.

53:18.000 --> 53:19.000
Is it land?

53:19.000 --> 53:22.000
He might have thought it was Lana.

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
Because we know Lana, we know Lana.

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
Is Lana spelled differently from Lana?

53:26.000 --> 53:29.000
No, no, Lana was just.

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
Do you correct people?

53:31.000 --> 53:35.000
Sometimes, if it seems like they're going to be saying my name a lot.

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
Lana is really the way you say it.

53:37.000 --> 53:42.000
Lana, that bitch was out of her mind.

53:42.000 --> 53:43.000
She's the worst.

53:43.000 --> 53:47.000
Yeah, she was just the worst.

53:47.000 --> 53:50.000
I kind of feel like there's a thing happening with Dino and Lana right now.

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
I feel like it's happening.

53:52.000 --> 53:53.000
Oh yeah.

53:53.000 --> 53:54.000
Well, don't kill it.

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
I don't think it can be killed.

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
I think that Dino's sexuality is.

53:58.000 --> 54:01.000
I'm going to whisper sweet nothing's in here right now.

54:01.000 --> 54:06.000
Nigger.

54:06.000 --> 54:10.000
It's my catchphrase, people.

54:10.000 --> 54:11.000
Man.

54:11.000 --> 54:14.000
It always works.

54:14.000 --> 54:20.000
It's such a hard R.

54:20.000 --> 54:21.000
All right.

54:21.000 --> 54:26.000
Well, Lana, Lana, what do you think?

54:26.000 --> 54:27.000
What do I think?

54:27.000 --> 54:28.000
Oh boy.

54:28.000 --> 54:31.000
You got a new book coming out?

54:31.000 --> 54:32.000
Dick pics.

54:32.000 --> 54:36.000
I'm trying to figure out a way to put a ribbon on it, not the dick.

54:36.000 --> 54:40.000
Lana, I see you've come here with a gentleman tonight.

54:40.000 --> 54:41.000
Are you guys involved?

54:41.000 --> 54:42.000
No.

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
No, no.

54:44.000 --> 54:45.000
He's here visiting from Texas.

54:45.000 --> 54:46.000
Oh, say no more.

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
If you want to sleep with him.

54:48.000 --> 54:49.000
It's cool.

54:49.000 --> 54:50.000
I can fuck him.

54:50.000 --> 54:51.000
Okay, good, good.

54:51.000 --> 54:52.000
I mean, as long as he's okay with that.

54:52.000 --> 54:53.000
He's okay with it.

54:53.000 --> 54:54.000
As long as he's okay with that.

54:54.000 --> 54:55.000
I just want to make sure the girl.

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
He won't know what hit him, believe me.

54:57.000 --> 55:02.000
Do you think the threesome guy, was he supposed to also have sex with you?

55:02.000 --> 55:05.000
Or was he supposed to just have sex with the woman alongside you?

55:05.000 --> 55:09.000
I was probably going to like lick his come off or something like that.

55:09.000 --> 55:10.000
I mean, if you're into it.

55:10.000 --> 55:11.000
Oh, fuck it.

55:11.000 --> 55:12.000
If you're into it.

55:12.000 --> 55:15.000
You guys are prejudiced.

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
They didn't booze the n-bomb as hard as that.

55:17.000 --> 55:18.000
Yeah.

55:18.000 --> 55:22.000
Yeah, that's exactly what I was thinking.

55:22.000 --> 55:28.000
There's got to be at least one African-American Harmon John fan here tonight that's just like,

55:28.000 --> 55:29.000
wait a minute.

55:29.000 --> 55:32.000
Yeah, I think I actually lost one.

55:32.000 --> 55:38.000
I'm going to go home and like ask myself a lot of questions about society.

55:38.000 --> 55:41.000
I would lick his come off of anyone.

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
Now nothing.

55:43.000 --> 55:47.000
Well, the best thing I can come up with to maybe end me being on stage.

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
Not that this wasn't lovely and thank you for having me.

55:49.000 --> 55:50.000
It's so boring.

55:50.000 --> 55:55.000
I used to ask when I was in high school and thought I was clever, would ask all the guys

55:55.000 --> 55:58.000
that I knew how they thought of their penis.

55:58.000 --> 56:01.000
Was it a tool, a trophy, or a toy?

56:01.000 --> 56:02.000
Trophy.

56:02.000 --> 56:03.000
And it was an interesting kind of poll.

56:03.000 --> 56:04.000
A tool, a trophy.

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
Well, Dan, you said you said you're just practical.

56:06.000 --> 56:09.000
So I'm going to go with tool with yours.

56:09.000 --> 56:10.000
Or a toy.

56:10.000 --> 56:11.000
A toy.

56:11.000 --> 56:19.000
Well, I mean, it's a toy until you get married and then it's a tool, right?

56:19.000 --> 56:26.000
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.

56:26.000 --> 56:27.000
It's a totem.

56:27.000 --> 56:28.000
A totem.

56:28.000 --> 56:29.000
A totem was a...

56:29.000 --> 56:30.000
What is the...

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
It was a tool, a trophy, or a...

56:32.000 --> 56:33.000
Okay, yeah, yeah.

56:33.000 --> 56:34.000
Yeah, it's all G words.

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
I'm trying to figure out how it could ever be a trophy.

56:36.000 --> 56:39.000
But like, I guess if it was really big?

56:39.000 --> 56:40.000
Yeah.

56:40.000 --> 56:41.000
Like...

56:41.000 --> 56:42.000
It doesn't have to be big.

56:42.000 --> 56:45.000
Because how do you win a dick?

56:45.000 --> 56:46.000
Come over here.

56:46.000 --> 56:47.000
Oh, God.

56:47.000 --> 56:48.000
What did you say?

56:48.000 --> 56:49.000
I said, come over here.

56:49.000 --> 56:50.000
I'll show you.

56:50.000 --> 56:51.000
You wrap it in like gold ribbon.

56:51.000 --> 56:52.000
That's right.

56:52.000 --> 56:53.000
Right.

56:53.000 --> 56:54.000
But it's your own.

56:54.000 --> 56:59.000
I mean, I understand how someone else could win it.

56:59.000 --> 57:07.000
I consider all of my wieners collaborators to be winners in some way.

57:07.000 --> 57:11.000
I hope they're not feeling like they lost something.

57:11.000 --> 57:18.000
But I took the trophy with me and also, never mind, I...

57:18.000 --> 57:19.000
I mean, would you have...

57:19.000 --> 57:20.000
I love my dick.

57:20.000 --> 57:21.000
Would you have...

57:21.000 --> 57:22.000
Would you have...

57:22.000 --> 57:23.000
Oh, what are you asking me?

57:23.000 --> 57:24.000
Would you have licked the...

57:24.000 --> 57:25.000
Come off it.

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
Yeah, it doesn't matter to me.

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
It's all...

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
We're all, you know, one organism.

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
We're all made of stars.

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
All made of stars.

57:35.000 --> 57:36.000
Yeah.

57:36.000 --> 57:37.000
All right.

57:37.000 --> 57:41.000
Well, any parting thoughts if you want...

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
No, that puts you on the spot.

57:43.000 --> 57:46.000
I'm always feeling like I don't want to deprive people of their moment.

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
You could just leave if you want.

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
Let's have a hand.

57:50.000 --> 57:51.000
Yeah!

57:51.000 --> 57:52.000
Lana!

57:52.000 --> 58:02.000
I don't have any final thoughts either.

58:02.000 --> 58:05.000
Yeah, the...

58:05.000 --> 58:10.000
I'm bad at interviewing and I'm bad at figuring out when to...

58:10.000 --> 58:11.000
How do you say...

58:11.000 --> 58:12.000
I think you're good.

58:12.000 --> 58:13.000
You're a nice guy.

58:13.000 --> 58:14.000
How do you say just...

58:14.000 --> 58:15.000
I don't want to...

58:15.000 --> 58:16.000
I didn't want her to leave.

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
You thank them and you say...

58:18.000 --> 58:19.000
No, she was fine.

58:19.000 --> 58:20.000
She was fine.

58:20.000 --> 58:26.000
I always feel like the Wisconsin in me wants to be ironic about it.

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
I don't want to just like...

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
I don't want to be like Craig Kilborn.

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
I feel perfectly respected.

58:32.000 --> 58:33.000
Oh, yeah.

58:33.000 --> 58:34.000
No, I wasn't worried about you, lady.

58:34.000 --> 58:35.000
No.

58:35.000 --> 58:36.000
No, no.

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
I wasn't...

58:38.000 --> 58:41.000
It's just a spineless thing.

58:41.000 --> 58:42.000
I don't want to take charge.

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
I don't want to be like...

58:44.000 --> 58:49.000
I don't like the idea of me coming across as having the pretense

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
that the show has any direction at all.

58:51.000 --> 58:52.000
I don't...

58:52.000 --> 58:53.000
That's what it is.

58:53.000 --> 58:54.000
Like, okay, let's keep it going.

58:54.000 --> 58:55.000
Come on.

58:55.000 --> 58:58.000
Let's thank her as if we have better stuff to do.

58:58.000 --> 59:02.000
I don't need you guys to talk right now, either.

59:02.000 --> 59:03.000
Yeah.

59:03.000 --> 59:06.000
Well, that's so funny.

59:06.000 --> 59:09.000
Well, not so spineless anymore.

59:09.000 --> 59:12.000
Dan, do you think it's because you're wearing a tux

59:12.000 --> 59:15.000
that you feel like now there's suddenly a structure to the show?

59:15.000 --> 59:16.000
No, no, no, no.

59:16.000 --> 59:19.000
This is a... I'm expressing a thing.

59:19.000 --> 59:22.000
I'm open sourcing my experience as I do the show for years.

59:22.000 --> 59:23.000
I've always done this.

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
I've always had trouble at the end of...

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
Is this your first fight?

59:27.000 --> 59:28.000
Of people.

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
Like, whether it's Greg Proops or anybody,

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
I never know if I'm supposed to go like,

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
okay, thank him for coming.

59:34.000 --> 59:37.000
It just feels like such an odd thing to be the person that says,

59:37.000 --> 59:38.000
all right, this phone call's over.

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
It's just a lot of power to...

59:40.000 --> 59:43.000
Right, but it's not me, and it's a gift.

59:43.000 --> 59:46.000
As opposed to putting somebody on the spot and saying,

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
like, you need to prove that you're...

59:48.000 --> 59:49.000
No, yeah, I get that now.

59:49.000 --> 59:50.000
I'm working through this.

59:50.000 --> 59:51.000
I get that.

59:51.000 --> 59:52.000
He doesn't need you to talk, lady.

59:52.000 --> 59:53.000
Yeah.

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
But if you just had a stroke and you're like,

59:55.000 --> 59:56.000
who are you?

59:56.000 --> 59:57.000
What do you wear?

59:57.000 --> 59:58.000
What's going on?

59:58.000 --> 59:59.000
Come, come, come.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:00.000
Go, go, go.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:01.000
Chicken, chicken, chicken.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.000
Grease.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:08.000
That didn't get a big laugh, but I liked it.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
I just play that song.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
I got it in my head.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.000
It's a good song, right?

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:16.000
Yeah.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.000
What's this guy's name again?

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Kevin MacLeod.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
It's all this free online stuff that I just found a bunch of

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:21.000
in a rush to get some music to play,

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
and I think we've got to make this guy famous.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
See, it's always on the wrong...

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:34.000
Let's do it from the top.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.000
From the top.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:36.000
You ready, Dan?

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.000
Okay.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Is this a real craving?

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Dan, I want you to sing less like you're about to die.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
Yeah.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:20.000
What up, motherfucker?

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
We don't know what's up.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:27.000
I will fuck you up for money!

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:28.000
I'm a hire killer.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
I've got a knife in my shoe.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:34.000
Cha!

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
Kingsman sucked.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
Some shitty movie.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:43.000
That movie sucked, and if you liked it, you're a sociopath.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:50.000
It was a toxically pee-wrapped film about nothing at all.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:55.000
Beep, beep, choo-ka-choo, 42, can't go to movies.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
Anymore, kids been sucked out the door.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:03.000
Stupid, knife-foot lady, just headbangs, doesn't have a character.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:08.000
Sam Jackson had a list, it's a choice.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
He's an actor, really embarrassing to sit through.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
That movie was fucked up, man.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
That movie was so fucked up.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
It would be out of breath for a couple of weeks.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
That song was called Sidewalk Out of Sight.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:30.000
Even with all that irony, I still feel old.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
I just don't understand anything.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:34.000
Just because I'm so groovy?

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
You're thinking, why are these kids here, why do they pay $10?

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.000
Yeah, why do they care about you?

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.000
I mean, I like you, you're a nice guy.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.000
But what the fuck?

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.000
What's everyone here for?

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:50.000
Tonight's not the night that it's evident why.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
It's more of a long-term relationship you have, I think.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:58.000
Like, you know, look at it like, do we have the night off, maybe?

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:01.000
Family?

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:04.000
It's a bad movie.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:08.000
It's a movie about dressing nice, I guess, and having knives for feet.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
It's a left-wing critique of spy movies.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
A left-wing critique of spy movies.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:18.000
What is the biggest anarcho-capitalist person to decide to save the world

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:20.000
by only allowing a lead to having all the court-

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:22.000
Bring him up.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:24.000
Fuck you!

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.000
Great, come here!

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:28.000
Come here!

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:33.000
If you want to come up and do a three-minute endorsement of Kingsman,

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:38.000
I just found it to be a profoundly toxic piece of garbage.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:40.000
I agree.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:45.000
But it's clearly controversial and here's why, because it's childish nonsense

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
and then every time they make a movie that includes childish nonsense,

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
if there's a dinosaur or a robot in it, or a lady with knife feet,

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:53.000
or it's based on a comic book, which is everything now,

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:57.000
then we all feel like it's religion and we all have to argue about it.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:02.000
All of a sudden, it's important whether you have the, if you're the Jew that has the curly thingies

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
or whether you have the special hat, or both.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:10.000
It becomes high stakes when nerds encounter each other in the over-cigarettes in the alley

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:12.000
about the fucking movie that came out.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:18.000
It's important to know for us, is this a good thing or a bad thing?

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:20.000
I'm 42, it's a whole different topic for me.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:22.000
It's just like these movies are just getting dumber and dumber.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:26.000
I'm telling you, I'm sorry, I just didn't like Guardians of the Galaxy.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
I'm so bored, I'm so tired.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:33.000
I just play Minecraft and I just go to sleep.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:39.000
I think that movies are for just people who, it's the third movie you've seen,

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
and if it's a third movie you've seen, then it's good, you know?

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:44.000
The third movie I saw was like Die Hard.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:48.000
I think I think we should revisit Guardians of the Galaxy, because I think it is a great movie.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.000
I did see it on like a hotel room TV.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Yeah, we'll watch it again, we'll give it a...

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
Have you seen Boyhood?

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.000
No, I haven't seen it.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
That's the thing about good movies, is you hear the good, the generally good movies are like,

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
I'm never in the mood to watch them.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
Because I'm like, oh Boyhood, that sounds like it's going to break my fucking heart,

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:07.000
so maybe I want to kill myself.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:13.000
Speaking of Boyhood, before we left, Patricia O'Kowt won the Oscar for Best Actress

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:15.000
or Best Supporting Actress.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:19.000
On the red carpet, Dan and I were watching red carpet footage

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:21.000
and she was being interviewed and she said,

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:26.000
well, I mean, one of the things I really like about me is how much I care about other people.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:29.000
She said what I like about me, really?

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
Yeah, that's literally what she said, almost verbatim.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:34.000
And then they said like, well, let's hear from your daughter

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:36.000
and they're introducing a new archette to us.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:40.000
And you can see it here in her daughter's eyes where she's like, oh, it's great.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:42.000
Say what she wants me to say.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:48.000
Yeah, I guess this is a great time, because my mom, it's just a great,

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
like she's come a long way because people are finally starting to recognize her.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:57.000
I was like, oh, man, don't feed your daughter lines on the SUV on the way to the,

01:05:58.000 --> 01:05:59.000
these are our cats.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
I was reading tweets, but she's a real carnation.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
I went in this, I went in the other room because it was playing loud

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:07.000
and Dan and I weren't in the same room and that happened.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:09.000
And I said, ah, 45 seconds.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:13.000
That's the amount of time it takes for me to go from loving Patricia O'Kowt to not.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
What was this guy yelling about over here?

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:18.000
Someone was yelling, who's yelling?

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
Can we tell the,

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
what were you what what what what the what the fuck.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
Oh,

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.000
we accidentally?

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:32.000
Okay.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
Is that the code of fans?

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:39.000
Is there any way to tell the carnations story?

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:41.000
I think enough time has passed.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:42.000
Right?

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:43.000
Okay.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:45.000
So don't let us get out of the room.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:49.160
Tell it again, you told it, it's a great story.

01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:50.160
We did?

01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:51.160
Yeah.

01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:52.160
The Carnation story?

01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:53.160
Okay, we told it.

01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:54.160
Here?

01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:55.160
On this show?

01:06:55.160 --> 01:06:56.160
Yeah.

01:06:56.160 --> 01:06:57.160
On this television show?

01:06:57.160 --> 01:06:58.160
Yeah.

01:06:58.160 --> 01:06:59.160
Okay.

01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:00.160
All right.

01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:01.160
What's the story?

01:07:01.160 --> 01:07:02.160
The Carnation story.

01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:03.160
All these in Kardashian's story.

01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:04.160
I don't know any Kardashian's story.

01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:08.840
We were writing a pilot for the, David Arquette was giving us notes and he...

01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:12.200
And he kept using the word carnation for incarnation.

01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:13.200
Right.

01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:20.200
And I was like, this is a carnation of that and I wasn't listening to his words, I was

01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:25.680
listening to his meaning more and I was like, fuck him, it's not a...

01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:32.360
And I finally, I burst out and Dan and Jay Johnston were there and I was like, and I

01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:38.240
finally burst out and I said, it's not a carnation of that, it's a carnation of this.

01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:41.840
And I was like, Jesus Christ, don't fucking make fun of him on top of everything that we're

01:07:41.840 --> 01:07:42.840
going through.

01:07:42.840 --> 01:07:46.280
I could see them out of the corner of my eyes, kind of like, like, burying their heads.

01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:47.280
And I'm like, what...

01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:48.280
And I'm like...

01:07:48.280 --> 01:07:49.280
And then I think they're making fun of me.

01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:50.280
I'm like, carnate...

01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:52.720
Oh, I'm saying carnation instead of incarnation.

01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:57.400
And I've out loud, I said, carnation, what am I, a fucking retard?

01:07:57.400 --> 01:07:59.800
Like, he didn't...

01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:00.800
Yeah.

01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:05.040
And I had no idea I was repeating David Arquette's word.

01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:08.240
And they thought I was a hero, like, wow, this fucking guy.

01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:11.840
I did not think you were a hero.

01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:17.280
I mean, I didn't think you were a villain, but I was, I knew at that moment I was blessed

01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:20.840
to have you in my life, but I didn't think you were a hero.

01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:26.360
Like, I was just, I thought our life was a movie, I wasn't sure if there was a central

01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:27.360
character or not.

01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:30.720
Speaking of due, Johnson, are you allowed to say what you're the cool thing that you're

01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:31.720
working on right now?

01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:37.840
Well, it's a, a lot of the people from Mr. Show are working on something.

01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:39.960
It's not, it's not going to be on HBO.

01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:41.960
It is movie.

01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:42.960
Yeah.

01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:43.960
Yeah.

01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:48.080
It's Bob, Bob and David are doing a sketch show and a lot of the original writers are,

01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:49.080
are doing it.

01:08:49.080 --> 01:08:51.440
And we're, I don't know where it's going to be yet.

01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:57.080
They're not telling me, but, but it's going, it's going to air somewhere.

01:08:57.080 --> 01:09:03.760
And yeah, we're doing a, a sketch show and, yeah.

01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:11.040
Probably Netflix, probably Netflix.

01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:13.040
He said probably, he said probably everyone.

01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:14.040
All right.

01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:16.040
Well, we should bring a, let's bring Spencer out.

01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:17.040
Spencer.

01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:31.040
From the moment that I saw you roll, those guys speak, speak, family, I have a bad one

01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:32.040
family.

01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:33.040
Hey guys.

01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:34.040
What's up?

01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:35.040
Spencer.

01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:36.040
Hi.

01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:37.040
Spencer.

01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:38.040
Hey Dino.

01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:39.040
I like your haircut, Dino.

01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:40.040
Thanks.

01:09:40.040 --> 01:09:43.880
You know, I, I woke up one morning in New York and drank a half a bottle of vodka and

01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:45.600
chopped it all off.

01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:46.600
Yourself?

01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:47.600
Yeah.

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:48.600
That's impressive.

01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:49.600
Yeah.

01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:50.600
It was a work in progress for a while.

01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:51.600
Yeah.

01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:52.600
You cut your own hair.

01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:53.600
Yeah.

01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:54.600
Yeah.

01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:55.600
How?

01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:56.600
I don't know.

01:09:56.600 --> 01:09:57.600
I was, I was fucking drunk.

01:09:57.600 --> 01:09:58.600
With scissors?

01:09:58.600 --> 01:09:59.600
Oh yeah.

01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:00.600
Yeah.

01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:01.600
Probably.

01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:03.600
It was an obsidian knife.

01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:04.600
Nice.

01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:05.600
Yeah.

01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:07.600
I, I, I always.

01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:09.600
I cut them with lesbian legs.

01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:12.600
I don't know.

01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:18.600
They, they say that that's the myth, that those don't work for aircuts.

01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:22.160
The, the, I always, I always, I always fantasize about that.

01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:24.160
You look in the mirror and you go, why not?

01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:25.160
I mean, come on.

01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:26.160
What, what was this?

01:10:26.160 --> 01:10:27.160
You could do it.

01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:28.160
You don't care how you look.

01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:29.160
Yeah.

01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:34.280
Yeah, now I guess I do, but, but, when I was a kid, I did it once and then I got shamed

01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:35.280
for it.

01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:36.280
You're married now.

01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:37.280
Why would you care how you look?

01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:42.880
I'm a spokesman for a major, uh, gotta go to South by Southwest.

01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:45.000
Are you a spokesman now?

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:46.000
Of, for Yahoo.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.640
I've been following you.

01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:51.560
For the show, the show's rolling out, so there's gonna be pictures of me and I'm gonna

01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:52.560
be like, I'm sad.

01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:55.160
They're making him wear a, a text that looks like an exclamation point.

01:10:55.160 --> 01:10:56.160
Okay.

01:10:56.160 --> 01:10:57.160
Sorry about that.

01:10:57.160 --> 01:11:02.000
And we're doing a Harmontown from South by Southwest, right?

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:03.000
Yeah.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:04.000
Yeah.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:05.000
Yeah, we'll be there.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:08.400
Uh, that's good news for you guys.

01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:10.360
We're flying you all out.

01:11:10.360 --> 01:11:14.680
Spencer, I always like to hear about what's going on with you and the world of current

01:11:14.680 --> 01:11:15.680
events.

01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:18.520
Oh, oh boy.

01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:19.520
So many things.

01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:24.120
I'm, I'm really, I'm really just firing on all cylinders today.

01:11:24.120 --> 01:11:26.400
What, what currently, what currently gets your goat?

01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:29.080
Is there a thing going on geopolitically or scientifically?

01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:30.080
What's your beef?

01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:31.080
What's your beef?

01:11:31.080 --> 01:11:39.040
I just heard a, a radio commercial on the radio for Lyft, the car share service.

01:11:39.040 --> 01:11:40.040
Nift?

01:11:40.040 --> 01:11:41.040
For Lyft.

01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:42.040
Lyft.

01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:43.040
Oh.

01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:44.040
And it was just, uh, it really got my goat.

01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:45.040
Okay.

01:11:45.040 --> 01:11:46.040
Let me try something else.

01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:55.120
Um, I listened to K, K, I listened to the KKK, they, I disagree with most of their views.

01:11:55.120 --> 01:11:57.160
They're losing focus.

01:11:57.160 --> 01:12:01.880
Their headlines like kind of close the conversation off, but the truth is they're flat taxers.

01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:06.960
They're really, they really have some very interesting economic, uh, it makes a lot of

01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:07.960
sense.

01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:08.960
No.

01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:09.960
Okay.

01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:10.960
I listened to this commercial.

01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:11.960
They really, they really niggered their economy.

01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:12.960
God stop it.

01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:13.960
You guys.

01:12:13.960 --> 01:12:15.160
I can't, I can't.

01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:18.360
I mean, it'd be shocking if you didn't say it.

01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:24.120
I know that's what I was thinking.

01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:31.320
Right up from the peanut gallery, the black guy over in the back, the black guys are like

01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:34.720
looking at the floor and going like, uh, tell me what it's over.

01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:39.160
I mean, Spencer backstage when they were, uh, when they were joking about your dick

01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:45.800
being a 20 sided dick, it, he, I couldn't, I couldn't tell cause I, but you, but you

01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:49.200
were like, were you secretly grinning?

01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:51.560
I was, uh, I had to say I was openly grinning.

01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:52.560
I don't know.

01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:53.560
Okay.

01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:57.800
It wasn't like, there's any, yeah, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, Spencer, if you could

01:12:57.800 --> 01:13:04.280
describe your penis as, uh, as a, as a mythical creature from the DND universe, uh, what would

01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:05.280
it most resemble?

01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:09.400
Um, what do you call it, uh, a Thakwa?

01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:14.320
That's like, uh, oh, sorry, hold on, hold on, start back up.

01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:15.320
What?

01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:20.120
I thought, I thought you just meant to, to pick a monster that it was the most light.

01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:21.120
Okay.

01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:22.120
Yeah.

01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:25.720
Yeah, sure.

01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:39.160
Looming in the distance, heavy with the musk of 14 woodland creatures floating imperiously

01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:41.600
through the forest path.

01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:45.720
It's, it, I don't know, it's just, I like how you, I like that.

01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:51.000
I'm going to use that covering technique from a distance.

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:52.200
That's a good, that's a good cover.

01:13:52.200 --> 01:13:53.200
Yeah.

01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:54.200
You can't tell.

01:13:54.200 --> 01:13:58.800
I really liked the dramatic music and then him saying, I, I, I don't know.

01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:01.840
I, I was sure you, the first word you were going to say was rising.

01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:05.160
Dan, you, you want to give a try for your dick, Dan?

01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:06.160
Yeah.

01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:07.160
Okay.

01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:08.160
Ready?

01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:18.040
From a really far, far place away, so far that you can't tell its dimensions, unimpressively

01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:28.880
simplistic pink monolith, switches from its pivot point on the lower abdomen of the voice

01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:37.920
of a new generation, dribbling with, with viscous pre-com, shit.

01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:44.080
Do my dick, do my dick.

01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:46.880
Same, same music?

01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:48.160
Yeah.

01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:52.440
There's nothing mysterious about it.

01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:55.080
You all have pictures.

01:14:55.080 --> 01:14:56.760
Look at your phone right now.

01:14:56.760 --> 01:14:59.760
I've texted all of you.

01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:00.760
That's it.

01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:05.560
All right, Erin, you're pussy.

01:15:05.560 --> 01:15:16.400
Unseen by the naked eye, needing a magnifying glass and shots of light to fry it open,

01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:32.880
tighter than any, tight and deep, but not too deep, containing the secrets of 14 creatures.

01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:38.520
15, 15 here.

01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:41.360
Another guy showed up.

01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:46.400
I wonder if the kid who tweeted me that he was 17 years old and he was coming to the

01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:52.360
show, if he was wondering if he could come to the show at 17 if he, if he came tonight.

01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:53.360
Are you here?

01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:54.360
17?

01:15:54.360 --> 01:15:55.360
You here?

01:15:55.360 --> 01:15:56.360
All right.

01:15:56.360 --> 01:15:57.360
See, that's good.

01:15:57.360 --> 01:15:58.360
I heard something.

01:15:58.360 --> 01:15:59.360
But that's fine, right?

01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:01.240
Like a Seth Rogen movie talks about dicks and cum and stuff.

01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:02.240
Who cares?

01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:04.240
I learned the truth at 17.

01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:10.360
Now you wouldn't lose your virginity for another seven years.

01:16:10.360 --> 01:16:11.360
It's true.

01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:12.360
Right?

01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:13.360
24 years old.

01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:14.360
24.

01:16:14.360 --> 01:16:15.360
I lost my virginity at 24.

01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:17.560
And Gina was mad because I beat you.

01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:18.560
Yeah.

01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:19.560
He beats me at everything.

01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:20.560
24.

01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:22.040
Even losing my virginity.

01:16:22.040 --> 01:16:23.040
I was a very late bloomer.

01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:24.040
I was a...

01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:25.040
Jesus.

01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:30.240
There's some, there's some rooties in the audience.

01:16:30.240 --> 01:16:34.360
I was 23 when I lost my virginity, but I suck cock at 12.

01:16:34.360 --> 01:16:35.360
Seriously.

01:16:35.360 --> 01:16:36.360
Really?

01:16:36.360 --> 01:16:37.360
Yeah.

01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:38.360
You sucked your first dick at 12?

01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:39.360
No, you didn't.

01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:40.360
No, I swear to God.

01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:41.360
What?

01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:42.360
Well, he was 12, too.

01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:43.360
So it was cool.

01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:44.360
Were you pals?

01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:45.360
Were you like playground buddies?

01:16:45.360 --> 01:16:46.360
Yeah, we...

01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:47.360
They were frenemies.

01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:48.360
You met him.

01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:49.360
You said you met him.

01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:50.360
We tried to have a threesome with you.

01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:51.360
No, we didn't do it.

01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:52.360
I like how you rush to reach it.

01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:53.360
No, no, whatever.

01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:54.360
Yeah, well, I saw your eyes.

01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:55.360
Don't stop coming around.

01:16:55.360 --> 01:16:56.360
He's like, is that what you're doing?

01:16:56.360 --> 01:16:57.360
Yeah, well, I saw your eyes.

01:16:57.360 --> 01:16:58.360
Yeah, well, I saw your eyes.

01:16:58.360 --> 01:16:59.360
Don't stop coming around.

01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:00.360
He's like, is that what you're doing?

01:17:00.360 --> 01:17:01.360
Yeah, well, I saw your eyes.

01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:02.360
Yeah, well, I saw your eyes.

01:17:02.360 --> 01:17:09.360
Don't stop coming around.

01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:15.360
He's like, is that what that pitch for an adult swim show was?

01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:17.360
Did you and Andy ever have any mess around?

01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:18.360
No, he never hit on me.

01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:19.360
I'm so upset.

01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:20.360
You're the only one.

01:17:20.360 --> 01:17:21.360
Yeah.

01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:22.360
I mean, I'm not attracted to him.

01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:23.360
Fuck him.

01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:25.360
I was in a hotel room at Disneyland.

01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:26.360
Of course, he wants you.

01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:27.360
Really badly.

01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:28.360
And there was a girl there.

01:17:28.360 --> 01:17:29.360
We're like, we're getting better.

01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:32.360
And he was trying to fuck everybody in the building.

01:17:32.360 --> 01:17:34.360
And he's just the most rampant.

01:17:34.360 --> 01:17:35.360
Yeah, except me.

01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:36.360
Except you.

01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:37.360
Yeah, nothing.

01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:38.360
What's that about?

01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:39.360
I don't know.

01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:40.360
I'm ugly.

01:17:40.360 --> 01:17:41.360
Yeah, poor me.

01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:42.360
Not in New York, you're not.

01:17:42.360 --> 01:17:43.360
No, no.

01:17:43.360 --> 01:17:45.360
Get over here.

01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:48.360
All right.

01:17:48.360 --> 01:17:55.360
Well, so we're going to play Shadow Run now.

01:17:55.360 --> 01:17:59.360
Dino, you were very, you were not a team player.

01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:00.360
With Dungeons and Dragons.

01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:01.360
Right.

01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:04.360
But Shadow Run sounds fun.

01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:07.360
Fuck, Ollie.

01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:11.360
I don't have to like anything you like.

01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:15.360
Spencer is in charge of the role-playing section.

01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:17.360
Do you think that, not to put you on the spot,

01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:19.360
but should Dino leave or should he leave?

01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:20.360
Yeah, I should leave.

01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:22.360
Please, let me leave.

01:18:22.360 --> 01:18:23.360
Well, whatever Dino wants.

01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:26.360
What if Dino can watch it and we can hear what he thinks of it after?

01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:27.360
He could do a little rap.

01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:31.360
Maybe I'll come back and talk about it and make fun of you.

01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:33.360
How about he stays up here but doesn't play.

01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:35.360
No, I want to go.

01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:36.360
You want to go?

01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:38.360
Yeah, there's a bar around the corner.

01:18:38.360 --> 01:18:39.360
Well, let's all thank Dino.

01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:40.360
Stay up on top of the stage.

01:18:40.360 --> 01:18:41.360
Yay!

01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:45.360
There, I did it.

01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:47.360
Thank you, Dino.

01:18:47.360 --> 01:18:55.360
And the moment you learn to take charge of your show,

01:18:55.360 --> 01:19:03.360
I can see your abilities as a host to grow.

01:19:03.360 --> 01:19:04.360
All right, Spencer.

01:19:04.360 --> 01:19:05.360
Family.

01:19:05.360 --> 01:19:08.360
Dan, would you pass out the character sheets for us since you're up?

01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:11.360
Character sheets.

01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:14.360
All right, Spencer, do you want to do like an intro from last time?

01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:17.360
Well, I mean, I can do one.

01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:21.360
I was just, last time we had Dan do a recap and I really liked that.

01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:22.360
I don't know if Dan remembers.

01:19:22.360 --> 01:19:25.360
Well, I don't remember this time as much.

01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:28.360
Does Jeff remember anything or any of you?

01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:30.360
I remember that we didn't do it.

01:19:30.360 --> 01:19:35.360
I mean, we killed those guards up front and we went back into the warehouse.

01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:40.360
I cast a fart spirit that went into the door and knocked out three drug addicts,

01:19:40.360 --> 01:19:44.360
like kind of like workers, and then two guys escaped and there was a seam in a wall

01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:46.360
that was clearly a door that they had used to escape from.

01:19:46.360 --> 01:19:49.360
So we are either in pursuit of them, which I imagine we are.

01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:53.360
If you just play like synth music while you do this.

01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:55.360
Is Dimarch here?

01:19:55.360 --> 01:19:57.360
Oh, is Dimarch here? Jesus.

01:19:57.360 --> 01:19:58.360
Is Dimarch?

01:19:58.360 --> 01:20:00.360
No, Dimarch? Going once?

01:20:00.360 --> 01:20:02.360
No, Dimarch.

01:20:02.360 --> 01:20:03.360
What are we going to do?

01:20:03.360 --> 01:20:05.360
We need our eye in the sky.

01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:07.360
We need that.

01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:09.360
Can somebody play Dimarch?

01:20:09.360 --> 01:20:10.360
What's your call?

01:20:10.360 --> 01:20:11.360
Hey, I don't care.

01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:12.360
Who knows Dimarch?

01:20:12.360 --> 01:20:14.360
Wait, is it a gal?

01:20:14.360 --> 01:20:15.360
Oh, yeah, you are there.

01:20:15.360 --> 01:20:17.360
Let's get a woman up here to play.

01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:19.360
Yeah, you can come on up.

01:20:26.360 --> 01:20:30.360
Well, her actual name is Meg Ryan on Oscar night.

01:20:36.360 --> 01:20:37.360
Who is this guy over there?

01:20:37.360 --> 01:20:38.360
What's going on over there?

01:20:38.360 --> 01:20:41.360
He's having a tough time over there.

01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:44.360
My heart kind of goes out to him because at one point we were like,

01:20:44.360 --> 01:20:45.360
Hey, what's going on?

01:20:45.360 --> 01:20:46.360
And then everyone looked at me and went,

01:20:46.360 --> 01:20:47.360
What? What?

01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:48.360
Nothing's going on.

01:20:48.360 --> 01:20:49.360
It's not important.

01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:50.360
What?

01:20:50.360 --> 01:20:51.360
It's important.

01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:52.360
No, he's okay.

01:20:52.360 --> 01:20:56.360
I mean, people come here to work stuff out, I guess.

01:20:56.360 --> 01:21:02.360
The nine people sitting around you didn't come here to work anything out,

01:21:02.360 --> 01:21:04.360
but I'll give them five bucks after the show.

01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:08.360
I feel like we have the more kind of baritone,

01:21:08.360 --> 01:21:10.360
activated Adam Goldberg over there.

01:21:14.360 --> 01:21:15.360
You did it to yourself.

01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:19.360
Spoken like an Adam Goldberg.

01:21:19.360 --> 01:21:20.360
Do you know him?

01:21:20.360 --> 01:21:22.360
You're kind of talking to him like you know him.

01:21:22.360 --> 01:21:23.360
No, I don't know him at all,

01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:25.360
but I know who Adam Goldberg is.

01:21:25.360 --> 01:21:28.360
Here we are.

01:21:28.360 --> 01:21:29.360
Are you on methadone?

01:21:29.360 --> 01:21:32.360
What's going on over there?

01:21:32.360 --> 01:21:39.360
It's like the Adam Goldberg 45 played at 78.

01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:47.360
Aren't you going to pay attention to me?

01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:50.360
Meg, is there a reason why you go by Megan at Megan?

01:21:50.360 --> 01:21:54.360
I was a very young child when a small elementary school teacher said,

01:21:54.360 --> 01:21:56.360
Oh, Meg Ryan, like the actress.

01:21:56.360 --> 01:21:57.360
And then they never let you-

01:21:57.360 --> 01:22:01.360
And then they got my BFA in acting and so it's funny.

01:22:01.360 --> 01:22:03.360
I'm mad at me for asking.

01:22:03.360 --> 01:22:05.360
I feel like you're going to hit me.

01:22:05.360 --> 01:22:06.360
No.

01:22:06.360 --> 01:22:08.360
If you were the first, it would be cute.

01:22:08.360 --> 01:22:10.360
If you were the 50th, it's still cute.

01:22:10.360 --> 01:22:12.360
And so you're 50th, so it's fine.

01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:13.360
I mean, you brought it up.

01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:14.360
You walked up.

01:22:14.360 --> 01:22:15.360
I did.

01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:16.360
You said, yes, really?

01:22:16.360 --> 01:22:17.360
I did.

01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:18.360
Okay.

01:22:18.360 --> 01:22:20.360
Well, this is going to be great.

01:22:20.360 --> 01:22:22.360
Cool energy.

01:22:22.360 --> 01:22:24.360
Me to the yow.

01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:26.360
I misinterpreted her energy too.

01:22:26.360 --> 01:22:28.360
I thought she knew that guy.

01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:30.360
I think she's just an assertive person.

01:22:30.360 --> 01:22:31.360
She knows your station in life.

01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:36.360
Do you- I hope that you are a forensics detective?

01:22:36.360 --> 01:22:40.360
Or a DMV supervisor?

01:22:40.360 --> 01:22:41.360
I just play them on TV.

01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:42.360
It's fine.

01:22:42.360 --> 01:22:43.360
Oh, you're an actor?

01:22:43.360 --> 01:22:44.360
Yes.

01:22:44.360 --> 01:22:45.360
Oh, okay.

01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:46.360
Oh boy.

01:22:46.360 --> 01:22:47.360
Your name's Meg Ryan?

01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:48.360
Yes.

01:22:48.360 --> 01:22:49.360
Good luck.

01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:53.360
Not the first time I've heard it.

01:22:53.360 --> 01:22:54.360
There's a weird energy overall.

01:22:54.360 --> 01:22:56.360
I wonder if it's a- it was not a joke.

01:22:56.360 --> 01:22:58.360
I wonder if it's because everyone's kind of- everyone's grieving.

01:22:58.360 --> 01:23:00.360
There's like a sadness in the air.

01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:02.360
Even if you didn't-

01:23:02.360 --> 01:23:03.360
Sure.

01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:04.360
Yeah.

01:23:04.360 --> 01:23:05.360
I don't know.

01:23:05.360 --> 01:23:06.360
Can we go back?

01:23:06.360 --> 01:23:07.360
Can we go back?

01:23:07.360 --> 01:23:08.360
Not to make this about me, but-

01:23:08.360 --> 01:23:11.360
That was a pretty good- oh, like Baldwin I was doing there.

01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:12.360
I have to say that was-

01:23:12.360 --> 01:23:13.360
That was a good-

01:23:13.360 --> 01:23:14.360
It was.

01:23:14.360 --> 01:23:15.360
That was great.

01:23:15.360 --> 01:23:16.360
I've never-

01:23:16.360 --> 01:23:17.360
Great.

01:23:17.360 --> 01:23:19.360
I've never really tried to do an Alec Baldwin in front of people.

01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:20.360
I think I might-

01:23:20.360 --> 01:23:21.360
I thought you should have done Oprah.

01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:22.360
It was really good.

01:23:22.360 --> 01:23:23.360
Pardon?

01:23:23.360 --> 01:23:24.360
I thought you should have done Oprah.

01:23:24.360 --> 01:23:25.360
Oprah, so there's that.

01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:26.360
Now you're on my dick.

01:23:26.360 --> 01:23:27.360
No, I'm kidding.

01:23:27.360 --> 01:23:28.360
Harry.

01:23:28.360 --> 01:23:29.360
Ah, yeah.

01:23:29.360 --> 01:23:33.360
Do you remember when we found out I do a pretty good Terrence Howard?

01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:35.360
Yes, yeah, yeah.

01:23:35.360 --> 01:23:37.360
Which is the same- it's the same- sounds the same as-

01:23:37.360 --> 01:23:40.360
One of you three Negroes is going to step up.

01:23:40.360 --> 01:23:42.360
It's a quote from Empire.

01:23:42.360 --> 01:23:44.360
And take over my record label.

01:23:44.360 --> 01:23:46.360
Wait, is he Irish?

01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:48.360
Ah, he's Terrence Howard, he's-

01:23:48.360 --> 01:23:49.360
Take over my record label.

01:23:49.360 --> 01:23:51.360
I want you to do that song again.

01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:54.360
Only do it like your mother was being shot.

01:23:54.360 --> 01:23:58.360
Did you- was it- am I mistaken, Dana?

01:23:58.360 --> 01:23:59.360
Did you do a John Malkovich for a while?

01:23:59.360 --> 01:24:00.360
Could you do a John Malkovich?

01:24:00.360 --> 01:24:01.360
No, I don't-

01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:02.360
Was that a Schrab?

01:24:02.360 --> 01:24:03.360
That's a tough one, yeah.

01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:05.360
Try a John Malkovich.

01:24:05.360 --> 01:24:07.360
Cold.

01:24:07.360 --> 01:24:09.360
Pain.

01:24:09.360 --> 01:24:12.360
I don't understand.

01:24:12.360 --> 01:24:15.360
Why are you asking me to do John Malkovich?

01:24:15.360 --> 01:24:16.360
That's not bad.

01:24:16.360 --> 01:24:17.360
You were there- you were halfway there.

01:24:17.360 --> 01:24:19.360
Yeah, it's not- you know.

01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:20.360
Alright, so are we recaptured?

01:24:20.360 --> 01:24:21.360
Should we try this again?

01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:23.360
Or should we just dive right into this, motherfucker?

01:24:23.360 --> 01:24:26.360
You should, uh, well, deal with music.

01:24:26.360 --> 01:24:27.360
Alright.

01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:28.360
Who's meter or you do it?

01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:29.360
I think you should-

01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:30.360
You- no, no, you do it.

01:24:30.360 --> 01:24:31.360
You did a great job.

01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:32.360
Spencer?

01:24:32.360 --> 01:24:33.360
It just needed music.

01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:34.360
And who's Meg Ryan playing?

01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:35.360
Uh, she'll be playing-

01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:37.360
Oh, God, uh, and when Harry met Sally,

01:24:37.360 --> 01:24:40.360
she plays just every woman.

01:24:40.360 --> 01:24:43.360
Everyone will have what I'm having.

01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:44.360
Everyone will have what I'm having.

01:24:44.360 --> 01:24:45.360
Spencer is not-

01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:46.360
I get to the deli.

01:24:46.360 --> 01:24:47.360
As comptroller, I'm going to outrank you, Spencer,

01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:48.360
because I love when you do it,

01:24:48.360 --> 01:24:49.360
and I want to hear you do it for us,

01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:50.360
if you don't mind.

01:24:50.360 --> 01:24:51.360
Alright.

01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:53.360
What's happening?

01:24:53.360 --> 01:24:55.360
Wrong song?

01:24:55.360 --> 01:24:58.360
Uh, here we go.

01:24:58.360 --> 01:25:00.360
Shadow Run.

01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:03.360
I'm going to recap.

01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:05.360
Starting in the warehouse district,

01:25:05.360 --> 01:25:09.360
our heroes infiltrated and stuff.

01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:11.360
They stunned two guards indoors,

01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:15.360
and then conspired to take out the three guards.

01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:18.360
But then a tear gas grenade went in the window,

01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:22.360
and through their plans, a riot.

01:25:22.360 --> 01:25:25.360
After killing the guards and setting off an alarm,

01:25:25.360 --> 01:25:27.360
they charged indoors, where their target,

01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:31.360
Baldwin Brown, was no longer able to be found.

01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:35.360
But the rest of the enemies were knocked out

01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:41.360
by a spirit that had a wife who made soup.

01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:43.360
After stunning the guards,

01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:45.360
our heroes were left with a conundrum.

01:25:45.360 --> 01:25:47.360
Where was Baldwin Brown?

01:25:47.360 --> 01:25:49.360
What would they do?

01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:51.360
There they are.

01:25:51.360 --> 01:25:53.360
Alright, thank you, Spencer.

01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:55.360
Alright.

01:25:55.360 --> 01:25:58.360
Are we all in that room with those machines?

01:25:58.360 --> 01:26:00.360
Yeah, you're all in this machine room.

01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:02.360
Yeah, you're in the warehouse.

01:26:02.360 --> 01:26:03.360
There's a bunch of junkies.

01:26:03.360 --> 01:26:04.360
They're starting to get up.

01:26:04.360 --> 01:26:05.360
I mean, there's not a bunch.

01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:06.360
There's three junkies.

01:26:06.360 --> 01:26:08.360
They're shambling around.

01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:11.360
They're looking around the open crates in the warehouse.

01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:15.360
Was I able to successfully convince them

01:26:15.360 --> 01:26:16.360
that everything was fine?

01:26:16.360 --> 01:26:18.360
Are they trusting us?

01:26:18.360 --> 01:26:20.360
They're not really paying too much attention.

01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:22.360
They're probably going to go right into those crates

01:26:22.360 --> 01:26:24.360
and get better than life chips.

01:26:24.360 --> 01:26:26.360
Yeah, because they're all drugied.

01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:28.360
But they don't seem to pose much threat to us right now.

01:26:28.360 --> 01:26:31.360
I don't know how much is in my head when I'm that drunk,

01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:33.360
but I wanted to stun Baton them

01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:36.360
and just keep the scene here.

01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:39.360
Like these guys who are wandering.

01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:41.360
I just want to stun each of them.

01:26:41.360 --> 01:26:45.360
What's your clubs plus agility?

01:26:45.360 --> 01:26:49.360
Bluff called?

01:26:49.360 --> 01:26:51.360
Clubs plus agility.

01:26:51.360 --> 01:26:56.360
I mean, mostly I like dubstep.

01:26:56.360 --> 01:26:59.360
Wow.

01:26:59.360 --> 01:27:02.360
I don't know what that phrase means.

01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:06.360
Clubs agility says three for rating.

01:27:06.360 --> 01:27:08.360
So what's agility then?

01:27:08.360 --> 01:27:09.360
My agility is five.

01:27:09.360 --> 01:27:10.360
Awesome.

01:27:10.360 --> 01:27:15.360
You...

01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:18.360
You stun one of the guys

01:27:18.360 --> 01:27:21.360
and then the others they kind of freak out

01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:23.360
and start running around in circles.

01:27:23.360 --> 01:27:25.360
Sit down or it's going to get worse than life.

01:27:25.360 --> 01:27:27.360
I go up to them.

01:27:27.360 --> 01:27:29.360
Hey, night play. Take it easy.

01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:30.360
I got this.

01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:32.360
I go up to them with my shot gloves

01:27:32.360 --> 01:27:34.360
because my little fingerless punk rock gloves

01:27:34.360 --> 01:27:35.360
are actually electrified shot gloves

01:27:35.360 --> 01:27:36.360
and I go,

01:27:36.360 --> 01:27:40.360
Oh my God.

01:27:40.360 --> 01:27:42.360
Are they close enough together to do both?

01:27:42.360 --> 01:27:43.360
No.

01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:45.360
Okay, then I go up and I give it to one of them.

01:27:45.360 --> 01:27:46.360
Right in the ass.

01:27:46.360 --> 01:27:47.360
All right.

01:27:47.360 --> 01:27:48.360
What's your...

01:27:48.360 --> 01:27:50.360
What's your clubs plus agility?

01:27:50.360 --> 01:27:51.360
I have four...

01:27:51.360 --> 01:27:53.360
Oh, it's eight plus four.

01:27:53.360 --> 01:27:54.360
All right.

01:27:54.360 --> 01:27:55.360
That's a lot.

01:27:55.360 --> 01:27:56.360
I know.

01:27:56.360 --> 01:27:57.360
All right.

01:27:57.360 --> 01:27:59.360
You also stun the person.

01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:00.360
All right.

01:28:00.360 --> 01:28:01.360
He goes down.

01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:04.360
Twelve.

01:28:04.360 --> 01:28:06.360
I'm just kidding.

01:28:06.360 --> 01:28:07.360
No, it is 12.

01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:08.360
I know, I know.

01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:10.360
That delay was a joke.

01:28:10.360 --> 01:28:12.360
Is this other guy like chasing by this?

01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:14.360
Is he wanting to play ball?

01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:15.360
Is he still running around?

01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:17.360
Oh, he's freaking out even more.

01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:18.360
He's at the door now.

01:28:18.360 --> 01:28:19.360
Night play.

01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:20.360
Take this guy down.

01:28:20.360 --> 01:28:21.360
All right.

01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:23.360
I take him down.

01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:25.360
What does that mean?

01:28:25.360 --> 01:28:26.360
What do you do?

01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:29.360
Do you handle him a horde of guard?

01:28:29.360 --> 01:28:30.360
Who am I?

01:28:30.360 --> 01:28:31.360
Are you sure?

01:28:31.360 --> 01:28:32.360
Yeah.

01:28:32.360 --> 01:28:35.360
I figured it'll go faster since...

01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:37.360
Because I don't have a problem with killing people.

01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:38.360
Is that what it's about?

01:28:38.360 --> 01:28:39.360
No, because it's your turn.

01:28:39.360 --> 01:28:41.360
I assume it was sort of that way.

01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:43.360
Under your special skills on your resume,

01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:45.360
do you have Norwegian accent?

01:28:45.360 --> 01:28:47.360
I'm worried about Baldwin.

01:28:47.360 --> 01:28:48.360
Oh, go ahead.

01:28:48.360 --> 01:28:50.360
Yeah, we're wasting time at Baldwin's escaping right now.

01:28:50.360 --> 01:28:53.360
Do not have the Norwegian, but I have the German.

01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:54.360
If you'd like the German.

01:28:54.360 --> 01:28:55.360
Close enough.

01:28:55.360 --> 01:28:58.360
I have the German, yeah.

01:28:58.360 --> 01:29:01.360
I have nothing interesting of any kind.

01:29:01.360 --> 01:29:03.360
You don't have to do that.

01:29:03.360 --> 01:29:04.360
It sounds great.

01:29:04.360 --> 01:29:06.360
Now I feel bad about pimping you out.

01:29:06.360 --> 01:29:08.360
Now you've put me on the spot.

01:29:08.360 --> 01:29:09.360
Now I have to do it.

01:29:09.360 --> 01:29:10.360
Oh, okay.

01:29:10.360 --> 01:29:11.360
You did this to yourself.

01:29:11.360 --> 01:29:12.360
It's your fault.

01:29:12.360 --> 01:29:13.360
Yes.

01:29:13.360 --> 01:29:15.360
There actually is going to be a fight.

01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:16.360
I love it.

01:29:16.360 --> 01:29:21.360
I've never been in a fight.

01:29:21.360 --> 01:29:25.360
We're not in combat right now.

01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:26.360
Anybody can go, right?

01:29:26.360 --> 01:29:27.360
Yeah, no.

01:29:27.360 --> 01:29:30.360
It's just all whatever.

01:29:30.360 --> 01:29:34.360
Do you know that Michael Keaton's original real name is Michael Douglas,

01:29:34.360 --> 01:29:40.360
and he had to change it?

01:29:40.360 --> 01:29:43.360
Meg Ryan's real name is Margaret Hyra.

01:29:43.360 --> 01:29:44.360
Oh.

01:29:44.360 --> 01:29:45.360
You're welcome.

01:29:45.360 --> 01:29:48.360
I talked about it for a stage name once.

01:29:48.360 --> 01:29:51.360
You love Meg Ryan.

01:29:51.360 --> 01:29:53.360
You love her.

01:29:53.360 --> 01:29:55.360
Of course, she's America's sweetheart.

01:29:55.360 --> 01:29:56.360
No, a professor told me once.

01:29:56.360 --> 01:29:57.360
She told me I needed to remember that

01:29:57.360 --> 01:30:00.360
because it would be funny once.

01:30:00.360 --> 01:30:01.360
While this is happening,

01:30:01.360 --> 01:30:02.360
I walk up in shock,

01:30:02.360 --> 01:30:03.360
love the other guy that's running around.

01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:04.360
Thank you.

01:30:04.360 --> 01:30:08.360
All right.

01:30:08.360 --> 01:30:11.360
He dodges out of the way

01:30:11.360 --> 01:30:13.360
and runs out the door.

01:30:13.360 --> 01:30:14.360
He's gone.

01:30:14.360 --> 01:30:17.360
You got a junkie on the loose.

01:30:17.360 --> 01:30:19.360
Don't you have mental powers?

01:30:19.360 --> 01:30:23.360
We're looking for this Baldwin, Billy Jack guy.

01:30:23.360 --> 01:30:24.360
This mission's a wash.

01:30:24.360 --> 01:30:25.360
If we don't find this guy,

01:30:25.360 --> 01:30:26.360
we haven't seen him yet.

01:30:26.360 --> 01:30:27.360
I don't know his name,

01:30:27.360 --> 01:30:28.360
but, however, can I sense the room

01:30:28.360 --> 01:30:30.360
to see if he's in the area?

01:30:30.360 --> 01:30:35.360
You sense a living person in the room,

01:30:35.360 --> 01:30:36.360
but you don't know where.

01:30:36.360 --> 01:30:38.360
Just in the general vicinity.

01:30:38.360 --> 01:30:41.360
Oh, he's hiding in that wall seam thingy right there.

01:30:41.360 --> 01:30:42.360
He's in the wall seam.

01:30:42.360 --> 01:30:43.360
We think it's a door, yes?

01:30:43.360 --> 01:30:44.360
Yes.

01:30:44.360 --> 01:30:45.360
Yes.

01:30:45.360 --> 01:30:46.360
All right.

01:30:46.360 --> 01:30:47.360
I think we go to the door to open it.

01:30:47.360 --> 01:30:50.360
Does anyone want you to have a gun on this person?

01:30:50.360 --> 01:30:51.360
I think we should all have a gun.

01:30:51.360 --> 01:30:52.360
Be ready for anything.

01:30:52.360 --> 01:30:53.360
We all should.

01:30:53.360 --> 01:30:55.360
Spencer, can I sense who's on the other side of the door?

01:30:55.360 --> 01:30:56.360
You can't sense who it is.

01:30:56.360 --> 01:30:57.360
All right.

01:30:57.360 --> 01:30:59.360
Let me go grab the junkie just in case.

01:30:59.360 --> 01:31:00.360
Oh, okay.

01:31:00.360 --> 01:31:01.360
Yeah, I was going to go.

01:31:01.360 --> 01:31:02.360
Do you want to see?

01:31:02.360 --> 01:31:05.360
My OCD is like this junkie just running.

01:31:05.360 --> 01:31:07.360
Like I'm going nuts now.

01:31:07.360 --> 01:31:08.360
It's a bad dream.

01:31:08.360 --> 01:31:11.360
So just stay by the seam and do what you will.

01:31:11.360 --> 01:31:12.360
I'm going to grab the junkie.

01:31:12.360 --> 01:31:13.360
Keep on doing what you're doing.

01:31:13.360 --> 01:31:14.360
It's working.

01:31:14.360 --> 01:31:15.360
I'm going to thank you.

01:31:15.360 --> 01:31:16.360
I don't know if that was sarcasm,

01:31:16.360 --> 01:31:20.360
but I'm going to run after Pursue the Junkie.

01:31:20.360 --> 01:31:21.360
All right.

01:31:21.360 --> 01:31:22.360
You run out the door.

01:31:22.360 --> 01:31:23.360
Is anyone doing anything simultaneously

01:31:23.360 --> 01:31:25.360
or are you just going to wait for that to finish?

01:31:25.360 --> 01:31:27.360
I think we should all be ready to open that door

01:31:27.360 --> 01:31:30.360
and be ready for Baldwin in case he's got surprises for us.

01:31:30.360 --> 01:31:31.360
Yes.

01:31:31.360 --> 01:31:35.360
And I'm currently wearing security guard clothes.

01:31:35.360 --> 01:31:38.360
And I am very charming.

01:31:38.360 --> 01:31:40.360
And you guys have my permission while I'm running.

01:31:40.360 --> 01:31:45.360
I'm sim-linking to say you guys can go on with the Shadow Run

01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:46.360
without me.

01:31:46.360 --> 01:31:48.360
I just, this is my own thing with the junkie.

01:31:48.360 --> 01:31:51.360
It's just like, I feel, I'm the guy that had to collect

01:31:51.360 --> 01:31:56.360
all of the secret packages in GTA before I finished the A story,

01:31:56.360 --> 01:31:57.360
you know.

01:31:57.360 --> 01:31:59.360
I'm going to unlock everything.

01:31:59.360 --> 01:32:00.360
I said the quicker you get that junkie

01:32:00.360 --> 01:32:01.360
and get back here, the better Nightblade.

01:32:01.360 --> 01:32:03.360
I agree, but just don't, I don't want to,

01:32:03.360 --> 01:32:06.360
one of my biggest nightmares is you'll get to know me better,

01:32:06.360 --> 01:32:08.360
but like feeling like I'm the reason why.

01:32:08.360 --> 01:32:09.360
All right.

01:32:09.360 --> 01:32:11.360
We don't have time to pacify you Nightblade.

01:32:11.360 --> 01:32:12.360
All right.

01:32:12.360 --> 01:32:13.360
We get it, but tick tock.

01:32:13.360 --> 01:32:15.360
I'm still, I'm multitasking.

01:32:15.360 --> 01:32:17.360
I'm saying this while I'm chasing the junkie.

01:32:17.360 --> 01:32:18.360
Okay.

01:32:18.360 --> 01:32:20.360
Thank you.

01:32:20.360 --> 01:32:25.360
My ghost and my dad is in a Tom Cruise,

01:32:25.360 --> 01:32:29.360
like hologram chip in my brain.

01:32:29.360 --> 01:32:33.360
So the rest of you guys are opening this door,

01:32:33.360 --> 01:32:35.360
swinging open the secret door.

01:32:35.360 --> 01:32:38.360
You were faced with two silver looking barrels

01:32:38.360 --> 01:32:39.360
and nothing else.

01:32:39.360 --> 01:32:42.360
It looks almost the size of a closet.

01:32:42.360 --> 01:32:45.360
You hear a metallic whir as the barrels rise up into the air

01:32:45.360 --> 01:32:51.360
and underneath them a hostile looking gun slash camera armature.

01:32:51.360 --> 01:32:53.360
Some sort of century gun device.

01:32:53.360 --> 01:32:58.360
It starts worrying as if it's about to shoot some fires.

01:32:58.360 --> 01:32:59.360
I dive out of the way.

01:32:59.360 --> 01:33:03.360
What's your reaction plus, what do you call it, intuition?

01:33:03.360 --> 01:33:08.360
Three plus seven total.

01:33:08.360 --> 01:33:09.360
Seven total.

01:33:09.360 --> 01:33:11.360
But also I have like cat like and all that shit too.

01:33:11.360 --> 01:33:13.360
Is that sneaking right now?

01:33:13.360 --> 01:33:14.360
No, it's not.

01:33:14.360 --> 01:33:16.360
What do you, what's your armor?

01:33:16.360 --> 01:33:17.360
Armor is 12.

01:33:17.360 --> 01:33:19.360
All right.

01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:21.360
Sorry everybody.

01:33:21.360 --> 01:33:24.360
You get hit in the armor, but it bounces off because it's armor.

01:33:24.360 --> 01:33:27.360
Yeah.

01:33:27.360 --> 01:33:28.360
The rest of you guys.

01:33:28.360 --> 01:33:30.360
No, you're right to applaud that.

01:33:30.360 --> 01:33:35.360
The rest of you guys are just facing the century gun that's firing at Eve.

01:33:35.360 --> 01:33:36.360
Okay.

01:33:36.360 --> 01:33:41.360
I, all right, I know, I know that, well, so it's a cat.

01:33:41.360 --> 01:33:43.360
There's, there's a camera.

01:33:43.360 --> 01:33:44.360
Yeah.

01:33:44.360 --> 01:33:45.360
Yeah.

01:33:45.360 --> 01:33:46.360
Let's stroke.

01:33:46.360 --> 01:33:47.360
Okay.

01:33:47.360 --> 01:33:53.360
I'm going to use my charisma.

01:33:53.360 --> 01:34:00.360
And I'm going to look into the camera because I can't move very fast anyway.

01:34:00.360 --> 01:34:01.360
All right.

01:34:01.360 --> 01:34:03.360
I look into the camera.

01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:04.360
Hi.

01:34:04.360 --> 01:34:07.360
There's a deal we can make here.

01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:12.360
We are, we're not lame.

01:34:12.360 --> 01:34:16.360
You're saying this while there's bullets flying around in the room?

01:34:16.360 --> 01:34:17.360
Yeah.

01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:18.360
Yeah.

01:34:18.360 --> 01:34:21.360
I do have, I'm still wearing, I still have that thing on right underneath my clothes.

01:34:21.360 --> 01:34:22.360
I have like armor on.

01:34:22.360 --> 01:34:24.360
I have like a bulletproof vest kind of.

01:34:24.360 --> 01:34:25.360
Okay.

01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:26.360
It's true.

01:34:26.360 --> 01:34:29.360
Wait, are you, you're not standing in front of the bullets though.

01:34:29.360 --> 01:34:30.360
No.

01:34:30.360 --> 01:34:31.360
Okay.

01:34:31.360 --> 01:34:32.360
Yeah.

01:34:32.360 --> 01:34:34.360
If there's any response, you're not paying attention to one.

01:34:34.360 --> 01:34:40.360
You think it might just be one of those like drone mounted guns, like not like controlled by anyone.

01:34:40.360 --> 01:34:41.360
Cool.

01:34:41.360 --> 01:34:42.360
Yeah.

01:34:42.360 --> 01:34:44.360
I mean, it's only kind of firing in one direction.

01:34:44.360 --> 01:34:47.360
So you aren't really in any real danger anymore.

01:34:47.360 --> 01:34:48.360
Okay.

01:34:48.360 --> 01:34:49.360
All right.

01:34:49.360 --> 01:34:54.360
Well, I'm just going to, just going to stand there and think about groceries I have to buy later, I guess.

01:34:54.360 --> 01:34:56.360
The bullets run out of the machine.

01:34:56.360 --> 01:34:58.360
So it's done firing now.

01:34:58.360 --> 01:34:59.360
Phew.

01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:00.360
Hello.

01:35:00.360 --> 01:35:05.360
We're here to talk if you're done showing off your trophy dick.

01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:08.360
It's just a small empty closet sized room.

01:35:08.360 --> 01:35:11.360
And those two cylinders took off and left the room.

01:35:11.360 --> 01:35:15.360
They kind of, it rose up and they were like hiding them, if that makes sense.

01:35:15.360 --> 01:35:18.360
You know, it was on top of the guns as they rose out of the ground.

01:35:18.360 --> 01:35:19.360
Oh, I got you.

01:35:19.360 --> 01:35:20.360
Okay.

01:35:20.360 --> 01:35:21.360
Yeah.

01:35:21.360 --> 01:35:24.360
The old gun turrets disguised as, we'll be right with you.

01:35:24.360 --> 01:35:32.360
Back in the junkies, the junkie is, he's running through the, he's running to the door that you cut open with your, your mono whip.

01:35:32.360 --> 01:35:37.360
What's your running plus agility?

01:35:37.360 --> 01:35:39.360
Probably like a million.

01:35:39.360 --> 01:35:40.360
Yeah.

01:35:40.360 --> 01:35:46.360
Running is, running is.

01:35:46.360 --> 01:35:47.360
Or athletics.

01:35:47.360 --> 01:35:48.360
Running, running.

01:35:48.360 --> 01:35:50.360
Athletics are.

01:35:50.360 --> 01:35:51.360
I think it's running though.

01:35:51.360 --> 01:35:52.360
I mean, what do you even look at?

01:35:52.360 --> 01:35:54.360
You might not have running.

01:35:54.360 --> 01:35:56.360
Oh, it's, so it's a skill, it would be a skill.

01:35:56.360 --> 01:35:57.360
Okay, I have running.

01:35:57.360 --> 01:36:00.360
It's three plus two.

01:36:00.360 --> 01:36:01.360
Awesome.

01:36:01.360 --> 01:36:03.360
I'll tell you what that is later.

01:36:03.360 --> 01:36:08.360
You quickly chase him down and you grab him by whatever you want to grab him by.

01:36:08.360 --> 01:36:09.360
Where do you want to grab him?

01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:10.360
His junkie scruff.

01:36:10.360 --> 01:36:16.360
You grab him there.

01:36:16.360 --> 01:36:17.360
He's grabbed.

01:36:17.360 --> 01:36:19.360
He's not very strong.

01:36:19.360 --> 01:36:27.360
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, where's the fire?

01:36:27.360 --> 01:36:29.360
Oh, everywhere.

01:36:29.360 --> 01:36:30.360
I got to get out of here.

01:36:30.360 --> 01:36:34.360
Hey, listen, just let me, let me have a conversation with you.

01:36:34.360 --> 01:36:35.360
He's struggling.

01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:39.360
He's treading water.

01:36:39.360 --> 01:36:44.360
How'd you, how'd you find out this was the place to get your, your chips on?

01:36:44.360 --> 01:36:48.360
My man, Brown man, he hooks it up for all the junkies.

01:36:48.360 --> 01:36:49.360
He really cares.

01:36:49.360 --> 01:36:50.360
Yeah.

01:36:50.360 --> 01:36:55.360
Is he still, is he still hanging out with Stacy?

01:36:55.360 --> 01:36:56.360
What?

01:36:56.360 --> 01:36:59.360
There is no Stacy.

01:36:59.360 --> 01:37:10.360
Oh, I don't think you even know Baldwin.

01:37:10.360 --> 01:37:14.360
What's, what do you, don't kill me.

01:37:14.360 --> 01:37:16.360
Why are you acting like you know Baldwin?

01:37:16.360 --> 01:37:17.360
You don't know him?

01:37:17.360 --> 01:37:19.360
I didn't act like that.

01:37:19.360 --> 01:37:20.360
Also, I do know him.

01:37:20.360 --> 01:37:21.360
No, you don't.

01:37:21.360 --> 01:37:22.360
I'm going to kill you for not knowing him.

01:37:22.360 --> 01:37:24.360
You can't prove you know him.

01:37:24.360 --> 01:37:28.360
You're not proving you know him enough for me to not kill you.

01:37:28.360 --> 01:37:30.360
You got to prove you know him.

01:37:30.360 --> 01:37:32.360
Baldwin, I'm on the, on the, on the com link.

01:37:32.360 --> 01:37:33.360
What's going on out there?

01:37:33.360 --> 01:37:34.360
It sounds like things are going bad.

01:37:34.360 --> 01:37:36.360
Hey, just get some information.

01:37:36.360 --> 01:37:46.360
We have a cyber Goldberg out here.

01:37:46.360 --> 01:37:51.360
I love that your Jim Nightblade sounds like Bruce Willis as portrayed by Justin

01:37:51.360 --> 01:37:58.360
Royland.

01:37:58.360 --> 01:38:00.360
If you know him so good, where is he?

01:38:00.360 --> 01:38:03.360
He must have took off when that siren happened.

01:38:03.360 --> 01:38:05.360
The alarm, I mean, the security one.

01:38:05.360 --> 01:38:06.360
Where does he go?

01:38:06.360 --> 01:38:07.360
Nib chips.

01:38:07.360 --> 01:38:08.360
Where does he go?

01:38:08.360 --> 01:38:09.360
Nib chips.

01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:10.360
I don't know.

01:38:10.360 --> 01:38:14.360
That's like the worst thing you could call somebody.

01:38:14.360 --> 01:38:15.360
I don't know, man.

01:38:15.360 --> 01:38:16.360
I don't know.

01:38:16.360 --> 01:38:21.360
Honestly.

01:38:21.360 --> 01:38:33.360
Well, why don't you say it again into the microphone and then I punch him in the face.

01:38:33.360 --> 01:38:34.360
Knock him out.

01:38:34.360 --> 01:38:36.360
Well, what's your unarmed plus?

01:38:36.360 --> 01:38:37.360
Oh, come on.

01:38:37.360 --> 01:38:38.360
He's a junkie.

01:38:38.360 --> 01:38:39.360
It's a.

01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:42.360
Well, you're, you know, you might not be a brawler by trade.

01:38:42.360 --> 01:38:43.360
Well, I stun baton.

01:38:43.360 --> 01:38:44.360
Okay.

01:38:44.360 --> 01:38:45.360
Well, let's just say that one works.

01:38:45.360 --> 01:38:48.360
Because you're touching him and it's a taser.

01:38:48.360 --> 01:38:49.360
It works.

01:38:49.360 --> 01:38:50.360
Yeah.

01:38:50.360 --> 01:38:52.360
He goes down to the floor.

01:38:52.360 --> 01:38:53.360
Okay.

01:38:53.360 --> 01:38:56.360
I run back to my comrades to the sound of bullets.

01:38:56.360 --> 01:38:57.360
What the hell?

01:38:57.360 --> 01:39:03.360
Is this a private party or am I invited?

01:39:03.360 --> 01:39:06.360
I just dashed a close one here night blade, but it looks like the bullets have run out.

01:39:06.360 --> 01:39:09.360
I leave you guys alone for five minutes.

01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:10.360
Yeah, we didn't ask you to.

01:39:10.360 --> 01:39:12.360
We were pretty happy with that guy leaving.

01:39:12.360 --> 01:39:14.360
We heard what you did over there.

01:39:14.360 --> 01:39:16.360
I'm a completist.

01:39:16.360 --> 01:39:22.360
I examine the room for other like ways to get out other doors behind behind the barrels.

01:39:22.360 --> 01:39:24.360
You see another secret door.

01:39:24.360 --> 01:39:25.360
God damn it.

01:39:25.360 --> 01:39:27.360
I examine the barrels.

01:39:27.360 --> 01:39:31.360
They look to be far too clean to actually store anything.

01:39:31.360 --> 01:39:32.360
And there's no labels.

01:39:32.360 --> 01:39:34.360
They look like decoy barrels.

01:39:34.360 --> 01:39:38.360
I'd like to sense to see if there's something beyond the barrels that we are not missing.

01:39:38.360 --> 01:39:41.360
You just sense that door other than that.

01:39:41.360 --> 01:39:42.360
You're not sense and nothing.

01:39:42.360 --> 01:39:43.360
Dammit.

01:39:43.360 --> 01:39:50.360
Well, it looks like he's not here.

01:39:50.360 --> 01:39:53.360
I guess we should just go home and call it a day.

01:39:53.360 --> 01:39:59.360
I guess some shadow runs don't go the way you want them.

01:39:59.360 --> 01:40:04.360
Clomp, clomp, clomp.

01:40:04.360 --> 01:40:05.360
We all...

01:40:05.360 --> 01:40:10.360
Can I examine the barrels to see if I can open them or see what's beneath them?

01:40:10.360 --> 01:40:13.360
The barrels were just hiding the gun, I think.

01:40:13.360 --> 01:40:16.360
I think those were just like decoy barrels to hide the weapon that almost killed me.

01:40:16.360 --> 01:40:17.360
Yeah, that's what's under them.

01:40:17.360 --> 01:40:18.360
There's nothing in them.

01:40:18.360 --> 01:40:23.360
Actually, you can feel and by touching them, they're actually completely hollow and they're probably not holding anything.

01:40:23.360 --> 01:40:27.360
I listen at the door and see if I can hear anything on the other side.

01:40:27.360 --> 01:40:28.360
You hear nothing.

01:40:28.360 --> 01:40:30.360
Is there a handle, a doorknob?

01:40:30.360 --> 01:40:32.360
Nope, neither.

01:40:32.360 --> 01:40:33.360
Nightblade.

01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:36.360
Use your strength and knock this fucker down.

01:40:36.360 --> 01:40:40.360
All right.

01:40:40.360 --> 01:40:49.360
Chim Chiminy.

01:40:49.360 --> 01:40:53.360
I used my... I kicked the secret door.

01:40:53.360 --> 01:40:55.360
That's the door, right?

01:40:55.360 --> 01:40:56.360
Yeah.

01:40:56.360 --> 01:40:57.360
That's like a seam.

01:40:57.360 --> 01:40:58.360
I'm not going to kick it.

01:40:58.360 --> 01:40:59.360
It's the future.

01:40:59.360 --> 01:41:01.360
It's not made of wood.

01:41:01.360 --> 01:41:06.360
I hurt my foot, which is probably also metal.

01:41:06.360 --> 01:41:09.360
What would a nano whip do in a situation like this?

01:41:09.360 --> 01:41:12.360
What if I were to open a can of nano whip?

01:41:12.360 --> 01:41:15.360
Nice, delicious nano whip topping.

01:41:15.360 --> 01:41:19.360
I stand back in case things go wrong.

01:41:19.360 --> 01:41:20.360
All right.

01:41:20.360 --> 01:41:21.360
They do not.

01:41:21.360 --> 01:41:25.360
You slice open the door, revealing daylight outside.

01:41:25.360 --> 01:41:27.360
Well, evening light outside.

01:41:27.360 --> 01:41:30.360
It's just the compound that leads to the out of doors.

01:41:30.360 --> 01:41:33.360
There's a fence with all sorts of holes and stuff.

01:41:33.360 --> 01:41:38.360
It looks like he must have booked it out of there.

01:41:38.360 --> 01:41:40.360
No, you're not.

01:41:40.360 --> 01:41:43.360
Big bulb and brown fence.

01:41:43.360 --> 01:41:45.360
He's rooting for the bad guy.

01:41:45.360 --> 01:41:52.360
I look outside of the hole onto the street to see if there's any sign, crumbs, footprints.

01:41:52.360 --> 01:41:56.360
There are footprints leading to a specific hole in the fence,

01:41:56.360 --> 01:42:00.360
but they go right to a sidewalk street outside the fence.

01:42:00.360 --> 01:42:04.360
So it's like he's going to a sidewalk and then all traces vanish.

01:42:04.360 --> 01:42:09.360
Can you look around and see if he's sensed anywhere?

01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:10.360
You're reading my mind.

01:42:10.360 --> 01:42:11.360
I thought it was my gig.

01:42:11.360 --> 01:42:12.360
Nice.

01:42:12.360 --> 01:42:17.360
Yes, I was going to ask if I could sense where he went from this hole in the cell fence.

01:42:17.360 --> 01:42:18.360
I don't think so.

01:42:18.360 --> 01:42:21.360
I don't think you have any senses like that.

01:42:21.360 --> 01:42:29.360
I'm going to go to the man that was knocked out by Nightblade.

01:42:29.360 --> 01:42:31.360
Which one, I guess, right?

01:42:31.360 --> 01:42:33.360
The one that was out in the end.

01:42:33.360 --> 01:42:36.360
The one that looks the least unconscious.

01:42:36.360 --> 01:42:37.360
Okay.

01:42:37.360 --> 01:42:39.360
You find one that's semi-conscious.

01:42:39.360 --> 01:42:40.360
Okay.

01:42:40.360 --> 01:42:48.360
Using my charisma and persuasion, I lift up his face.

01:42:48.360 --> 01:42:51.360
Hey honey, hey, hey.

01:42:51.360 --> 01:42:52.360
Hey.

01:42:52.360 --> 01:42:53.360
Hey, are you okay?

01:42:53.360 --> 01:42:56.360
I got shocked.

01:42:56.360 --> 01:42:57.360
I know that's hard.

01:42:57.360 --> 01:43:00.360
That's hard when that happens.

01:43:00.360 --> 01:43:02.360
I'm here to help you.

01:43:02.360 --> 01:43:03.360
I'm an angel.

01:43:03.360 --> 01:43:04.360
Oh good.

01:43:04.360 --> 01:43:05.360
Yeah.

01:43:05.360 --> 01:43:11.360
Hey, we're trying to find your friend Baldwin.

01:43:11.360 --> 01:43:14.360
It's really important that you tell us where he is.

01:43:14.360 --> 01:43:17.360
Can you tell me anything about where he stays or any hideouts, sweetie?

01:43:17.360 --> 01:43:18.360
Just here.

01:43:18.360 --> 01:43:19.360
He was just here.

01:43:19.360 --> 01:43:20.360
Yeah.

01:43:20.360 --> 01:43:23.360
Does he have any restaurants he likes?

01:43:23.360 --> 01:43:25.360
Do you know where he lives?

01:43:25.360 --> 01:43:27.360
No, I barely know him.

01:43:27.360 --> 01:43:29.360
I just buy drugs off the guy.

01:43:29.360 --> 01:43:30.360
Oh honey.

01:43:30.360 --> 01:43:35.360
I smack him in the face and move to the next one.

01:43:35.360 --> 01:43:41.360
I summon an eagle to fly through the sky to see if we can see any sign of Baldwin on escape.

01:43:41.360 --> 01:43:42.360
All right.

01:43:42.360 --> 01:43:44.360
What's your conjuring plus magic there?

01:43:44.360 --> 01:43:49.360
First, I activate my spirit focus for spirits of air, which gives me an extra thing.

01:43:49.360 --> 01:43:52.360
And then my conjuring is...

01:43:52.360 --> 01:43:53.360
It's summoning.

01:43:53.360 --> 01:43:55.360
It's five plus what?

01:43:55.360 --> 01:43:56.360
Magic.

01:43:56.360 --> 01:43:58.360
So 11 plus two.

01:43:58.360 --> 01:43:59.360
That's 13.

01:43:59.360 --> 01:44:00.360
Yep.

01:44:00.360 --> 01:44:01.360
You summon...

01:44:01.360 --> 01:44:04.360
Wait, what force spirit do you want to summon?

01:44:04.360 --> 01:44:05.360
An eagle.

01:44:05.360 --> 01:44:06.360
No, what force?

01:44:06.360 --> 01:44:07.360
Pick a number.

01:44:07.360 --> 01:44:08.360
Force four.

01:44:08.360 --> 01:44:09.360
All right.

01:44:09.360 --> 01:44:10.360
All right.

01:44:10.360 --> 01:44:13.360
You take four drain damage as it comes into the ether.

01:44:13.360 --> 01:44:19.360
It's an exerting work pulling multiple spirits to the metaphysical, the regular physical.

01:44:19.360 --> 01:44:21.360
I thought my other spirit went away.

01:44:21.360 --> 01:44:22.360
It sure did, Dan.

01:44:22.360 --> 01:44:23.360
Not Dan.

01:44:23.360 --> 01:44:24.360
Jeff.

01:44:24.360 --> 01:44:26.360
It sure did, Jeff.

01:44:26.360 --> 01:44:28.360
You don't even know the difference between us.

01:44:28.360 --> 01:44:29.360
I don't know.

01:44:29.360 --> 01:44:31.360
Why is that possible spirits?

01:44:31.360 --> 01:44:34.360
I just took a lot of drain on that eagle.

01:44:34.360 --> 01:44:35.360
Yep.

01:44:35.360 --> 01:44:36.360
All right.

01:44:36.360 --> 01:44:38.360
I look at the eagle and I'm a little woozy and I say eagle, fly.

01:44:38.360 --> 01:44:39.360
Look for Baldwin Brown.

01:44:39.360 --> 01:44:41.360
He's a balding guy who looks like this and that and whatever.

01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:44.360
Take it to the sky and see if you can find an eagle.

01:44:44.360 --> 01:44:46.360
I will, leave.

01:44:46.360 --> 01:44:49.360
Can we have the voice of the eagle be the drunk guy over there?

01:44:49.360 --> 01:44:51.360
It's just like, could he just be...

01:44:51.360 --> 01:44:53.360
You didn't like my voice, but I did.

01:44:53.360 --> 01:44:54.360
What is that we did?

01:44:54.360 --> 01:44:55.360
I want to do my voice.

01:44:55.360 --> 01:44:56.360
Oh, sorry.

01:44:56.360 --> 01:44:57.360
Sorry.

01:44:57.360 --> 01:44:58.360
Yeah, do your voice.

01:44:58.360 --> 01:44:59.360
You served my eagle voices?

01:44:59.360 --> 01:45:00.360
Oh, I'm sorry, Jeff.

01:45:00.360 --> 01:45:01.360
I don't want to.

01:45:01.360 --> 01:45:04.360
You already made my other spirit a fart the other day.

01:45:04.360 --> 01:45:05.360
You made it a fart?

01:45:05.360 --> 01:45:06.360
No, I didn't make it a fart.

01:45:06.360 --> 01:45:08.360
It was a spirit of wind.

01:45:08.360 --> 01:45:09.360
Sorry.

01:45:09.360 --> 01:45:12.360
While this stuff is happening also, I'm going to...

01:45:12.360 --> 01:45:16.360
For my part, I'm going to go see if I can gather from the crates

01:45:16.360 --> 01:45:18.360
where those junkies were headed.

01:45:18.360 --> 01:45:23.360
I'm going to try to pick up the secondary goal,

01:45:23.360 --> 01:45:25.360
which is gather as many of these BTL chips.

01:45:25.360 --> 01:45:26.360
All right.

01:45:26.360 --> 01:45:28.360
There's way too many chips.

01:45:28.360 --> 01:45:33.360
Also, the spirit takes off quickly to follow your instructions.

01:45:33.360 --> 01:45:34.360
Nightplay, I think there's a...

01:45:34.360 --> 01:45:35.360
Isn't there a truck in there?

01:45:35.360 --> 01:45:38.360
There's two semi-trucks and there's just multiple dozens of crates.

01:45:38.360 --> 01:45:41.360
We might be able to load up these trucks and take them out that way.

01:45:41.360 --> 01:45:42.360
Yeah.

01:45:42.360 --> 01:45:43.360
That's what I was thinking.

01:45:43.360 --> 01:45:47.360
Okay, so while the spirit is out scouting around,

01:45:47.360 --> 01:45:51.360
let's find as many crates as the BTLs and load these trucks up.

01:45:51.360 --> 01:45:52.360
I'll do it.

01:45:52.360 --> 01:45:53.360
You do that.

01:45:53.360 --> 01:45:55.360
You load up 12...

01:45:55.360 --> 01:46:00.360
No, 25 BTL boxes onto the semi-truck.

01:46:00.360 --> 01:46:01.360
All right.

01:46:01.360 --> 01:46:05.360
Okay, I'm at the next guy.

01:46:05.360 --> 01:46:06.360
All right.

01:46:06.360 --> 01:46:09.360
And I'm going to use con.

01:46:09.360 --> 01:46:10.360
All right.

01:46:10.360 --> 01:46:11.360
I rouse him.

01:46:11.360 --> 01:46:13.360
I'm going to try something different.

01:46:13.360 --> 01:46:14.360
All right.

01:46:14.360 --> 01:46:15.360
What's your con plus charisma?

01:46:15.360 --> 01:46:18.360
My con is nine.

01:46:18.360 --> 01:46:21.360
Well, it says six and then in parentheses, nine.

01:46:21.360 --> 01:46:23.360
And my charisma is seven.

01:46:23.360 --> 01:46:24.360
All right.

01:46:24.360 --> 01:46:25.360
Okay.

01:46:25.360 --> 01:46:26.360
All right.

01:46:26.360 --> 01:46:27.360
What are you saying?

01:46:27.360 --> 01:46:28.360
Hey.

01:46:28.360 --> 01:46:29.360
Hey, you dumb piece of shit.

01:46:29.360 --> 01:46:30.360
Hey, wake up.

01:46:30.360 --> 01:46:31.360
Fuck up.

01:46:31.360 --> 01:46:32.360
Wake up.

01:46:32.360 --> 01:46:34.360
Wake the fuck up.

01:46:34.360 --> 01:46:35.360
Well, that's intimidation, though.

01:46:35.360 --> 01:46:36.360
Oh, sorry.

01:46:36.360 --> 01:46:37.360
Well, okay.

01:46:37.360 --> 01:46:38.360
Sorry, sorry.

01:46:38.360 --> 01:46:39.360
Hey.

01:46:39.360 --> 01:46:41.360
Hey, do you know, do you know where your mom is?

01:46:41.360 --> 01:46:42.360
What?

01:46:42.360 --> 01:46:43.360
No, what?

01:46:43.360 --> 01:46:45.360
I said, do you know where your mom is?

01:46:45.360 --> 01:46:46.360
She's dead.

01:46:46.360 --> 01:46:47.360
Yeah.

01:46:47.360 --> 01:46:48.360
Yeah.

01:46:48.360 --> 01:46:51.360
Do you know where your dad is?

01:46:51.360 --> 01:46:54.360
The bar?

01:46:54.360 --> 01:46:55.360
No.

01:46:55.360 --> 01:46:58.360
No, he's not at the bar.

01:46:58.360 --> 01:46:59.360
Oh, fuck.

01:46:59.360 --> 01:47:08.360
Your, your dad is on the other side of town facing a rat king.

01:47:08.360 --> 01:47:12.360
Tails are a metal.

01:47:12.360 --> 01:47:18.360
We've tied him up and he's almost dead motherfucker.

01:47:18.360 --> 01:47:20.360
Just like you get your fucking life together.

01:47:20.360 --> 01:47:22.360
Now where's Baldwin and I'll save your dad.

01:47:22.360 --> 01:47:23.360
I don't know.

01:47:23.360 --> 01:47:26.360
I got knocked out early.

01:47:26.360 --> 01:47:27.360
I slap him.

01:47:27.360 --> 01:47:28.360
Tell me anything.

01:47:28.360 --> 01:47:31.360
I, I, I wet my bed.

01:47:31.360 --> 01:47:33.360
Fucking dumb piece of shit.

01:47:33.360 --> 01:47:34.360
Tell me something about Baldwin.

01:47:34.360 --> 01:47:35.360
Give me a picture.

01:47:35.360 --> 01:47:37.360
Yeah, I got a, here, here.

01:47:37.360 --> 01:47:39.360
I, I don't, why is this in my pocket?

01:47:39.360 --> 01:47:41.360
I have a picture of him right here.

01:47:41.360 --> 01:47:42.360
Uh.

01:47:42.360 --> 01:47:46.360
He hands you a picture.

01:47:46.360 --> 01:47:47.360
Thanks.

01:47:47.360 --> 01:47:51.360
I, I take the picture and I, and I put it, put it in my pocket.

01:47:51.360 --> 01:47:52.360
I, uh.

01:47:52.360 --> 01:47:56.360
Just don't kill my dad.

01:47:56.360 --> 01:47:58.360
All right.

01:47:58.360 --> 01:48:00.360
Maybe I won't kill your dad.

01:48:00.360 --> 01:48:01.360
Thank you.

01:48:01.360 --> 01:48:05.360
But I'm going to watch you and I take out one of my tracking tags.

01:48:05.360 --> 01:48:14.360
And I, and I open his jaw and I stuff it in his mouth and I close his mouth and I say,

01:48:14.360 --> 01:48:18.360
my name is Mercy O'Donnell motherfucker.

01:48:18.360 --> 01:48:25.360
I got eyes like diamonds, but they sharp.

01:48:25.360 --> 01:48:30.360
Oh, okay.

01:48:30.360 --> 01:48:33.360
Karen McAfee everybody.

01:48:33.360 --> 01:48:34.360
All right.

01:48:34.360 --> 01:48:36.360
I guess she.

01:48:36.360 --> 01:48:43.360
I didn't know it was that easy.

01:48:43.360 --> 01:48:48.360
I didn't know you could do that.

01:48:48.360 --> 01:48:51.360
So the beauty of the imagination down.

01:48:51.360 --> 01:48:52.360
No.

01:48:52.360 --> 01:48:53.360
You, what?

01:48:53.360 --> 01:48:54.360
Okay.

01:48:54.360 --> 01:48:56.360
I mean, does she die when that happens?

01:48:56.360 --> 01:48:58.360
Like, is it like, it's like a Bruce Willis surrogate.

01:48:58.360 --> 01:48:59.360
It just goes.

01:48:59.360 --> 01:49:00.360
Sorry.

01:49:00.360 --> 01:49:01.360
All right.

01:49:01.360 --> 01:49:14.360
We're all going through stuff.

01:49:14.360 --> 01:49:15.360
We're all grieving.

01:49:15.360 --> 01:49:17.360
We all grieve in different ways.

01:49:17.360 --> 01:49:20.360
So all that work, you got, you got a picture of a guy that we already know what he looks

01:49:20.360 --> 01:49:21.360
like.

01:49:21.360 --> 01:49:23.360
Well, you didn't know exactly.

01:49:23.360 --> 01:49:25.360
Didn't we see him on a screen?

01:49:25.360 --> 01:49:26.360
We saw him on a screen.

01:49:26.360 --> 01:49:27.360
I don't know.

01:49:27.360 --> 01:49:28.360
Maybe.

01:49:28.360 --> 01:49:29.360
Maybe.

01:49:29.360 --> 01:49:30.360
Yeah.

01:49:30.360 --> 01:49:32.360
While back, our contact, our Mr. Johnson showed him.

01:49:32.360 --> 01:49:33.360
Well, so I look at the picture.

01:49:33.360 --> 01:49:34.360
Is he doing anything in the picture?

01:49:34.360 --> 01:49:37.360
Like standing in front of his mailbox or the mattress or anything?

01:49:37.360 --> 01:49:41.360
You know, the pictures that we all carry with us and give to people.

01:49:41.360 --> 01:49:45.360
No, he's just, it's like, it's, it's the interior of a bathroom.

01:49:45.360 --> 01:49:46.360
Oh, okay.

01:49:46.360 --> 01:49:49.360
Can I use perception to know where that bathroom is?

01:49:49.360 --> 01:49:52.360
And what is he doing in the bathroom?

01:49:52.360 --> 01:49:57.360
He's just taking a picture in the mirror, selfie stuff.

01:49:57.360 --> 01:50:00.360
What, what's your perception plus intuition?

01:50:00.360 --> 01:50:01.360
I'm so sorry.

01:50:01.360 --> 01:50:04.360
I took my folder and I left it in the green room.

01:50:04.360 --> 01:50:07.360
Well, you can't find out where his bathroom is located then.

01:50:07.360 --> 01:50:08.360
Okay.

01:50:08.360 --> 01:50:09.360
That's fair.

01:50:09.360 --> 01:50:10.360
No, that's fair.

01:50:10.360 --> 01:50:11.360
That's fair.

01:50:11.360 --> 01:50:12.360
I don't think you could anyway to be fair.

01:50:12.360 --> 01:50:13.360
Yeah.

01:50:13.360 --> 01:50:15.360
I mean, even if you saw really well.

01:50:15.360 --> 01:50:16.360
Okay.

01:50:16.360 --> 01:50:21.360
It was worth how empowered I felt for the 30 seconds this, this embarrassment right now.

01:50:21.360 --> 01:50:23.360
So the semi trucks all loaded up.

01:50:23.360 --> 01:50:25.360
The spirit hasn't come back.

01:50:25.360 --> 01:50:27.360
It's only been about five minutes.

01:50:27.360 --> 01:50:32.360
Anybody got a class C license?

01:50:32.360 --> 01:50:33.360
I never learned how to drive.

01:50:33.360 --> 01:50:37.360
I live in the woods for so long.

01:50:37.360 --> 01:50:39.360
It's class C trucks.

01:50:39.360 --> 01:50:40.360
No, that's normal style.

01:50:40.360 --> 01:50:41.360
That's normal, isn't it?

01:50:41.360 --> 01:50:42.360
Yeah.

01:50:42.360 --> 01:50:44.360
So class A is like, is that a snowmobile or is that a...

01:50:44.360 --> 01:50:50.360
I think class B is small trucks and then class A is like all the cool trucks and the hover cars.

01:50:50.360 --> 01:50:54.360
Does hardware help with that or software?

01:50:54.360 --> 01:50:56.360
No, it would just be driving.

01:50:56.360 --> 01:50:57.360
Yeah.

01:50:57.360 --> 01:50:58.360
Oh.

01:50:58.360 --> 01:51:00.360
I ain't got that.

01:51:00.360 --> 01:51:02.360
I think horticard knows how to drive.

01:51:02.360 --> 01:51:03.360
Horticard.

01:51:03.360 --> 01:51:04.360
Driving?

01:51:04.360 --> 01:51:05.360
No.

01:51:05.360 --> 01:51:06.360
Hold on.

01:51:08.360 --> 01:51:09.360
Hosh.

01:51:09.360 --> 01:51:12.360
I don't know if I like this guy or if I don't like this guy.

01:51:12.360 --> 01:51:14.360
I don't think I do.

01:51:14.360 --> 01:51:16.360
I don't think I like him.

01:51:16.360 --> 01:51:17.360
Nope.

01:51:17.360 --> 01:51:18.360
The answer is no.

01:51:18.360 --> 01:51:20.360
The island has voted you off, sir.

01:51:20.360 --> 01:51:22.360
It's on this page.

01:51:22.360 --> 01:51:23.360
Is it?

01:51:23.360 --> 01:51:24.360
All right.

01:51:24.360 --> 01:51:25.360
Let's just pretend you can.

01:51:25.360 --> 01:51:26.360
All right.

01:51:26.360 --> 01:51:27.360
Where are we going to drive to?

01:51:27.360 --> 01:51:29.360
I volunteered to drive the truck.

01:51:29.360 --> 01:51:30.360
Class C you said.

01:51:30.360 --> 01:51:32.360
One of us can certainly drive a truck.

01:51:32.360 --> 01:51:33.360
Yeah.

01:51:33.360 --> 01:51:34.360
Horticard can.

01:51:34.360 --> 01:51:35.360
Okay.

01:51:35.360 --> 01:51:36.360
All right.

01:51:36.360 --> 01:51:37.360
But before you can...

01:51:37.360 --> 01:51:38.360
Yeah.

01:51:38.360 --> 01:51:39.360
You have ground pilot.

01:51:39.360 --> 01:51:40.360
Is that driving?

01:51:40.360 --> 01:51:41.360
Yep.

01:51:41.360 --> 01:51:42.360
Ground pilot.

01:51:42.360 --> 01:51:43.360
That's the same?

01:51:43.360 --> 01:51:44.360
Thank you.

01:51:44.360 --> 01:51:45.360
Thank you, Mercy.

01:51:45.360 --> 01:51:46.360
Oh, it's not a hover car.

01:51:46.360 --> 01:51:49.360
No, I'm going to sit on my high floor.

01:51:54.360 --> 01:51:56.360
I'm going to sit with Mercy.

01:51:57.360 --> 01:51:58.360
That's nuts.

01:51:58.360 --> 01:51:59.360
But that's a chatter.

01:51:59.360 --> 01:52:00.360
Okay.

01:52:00.360 --> 01:52:02.360
Are you guys actually doing space work with the...

01:52:02.360 --> 01:52:03.360
Now you're in the truck?

01:52:03.360 --> 01:52:04.360
Yeah.

01:52:04.360 --> 01:52:05.360
I'm in the truck.

01:52:05.360 --> 01:52:06.360
Okay.

01:52:06.360 --> 01:52:07.360
I'm driving as a Class C truck.

01:52:07.360 --> 01:52:08.360
That's what you wanted from me, isn't it?

01:52:08.360 --> 01:52:09.360
I'm in the back.

01:52:09.360 --> 01:52:10.360
So there's like a split screen.

01:52:10.360 --> 01:52:12.360
I'm on the back too.

01:52:12.360 --> 01:52:16.360
So her ground pilot is four.

01:52:16.360 --> 01:52:18.360
Ground pilot is four and...

01:52:18.360 --> 01:52:19.360
And the...

01:52:19.360 --> 01:52:20.360
I'm sorry, what was the other thing?

01:52:20.360 --> 01:52:21.360
Initiative?

01:52:21.360 --> 01:52:22.360
Initiative?

01:52:22.360 --> 01:52:23.360
Oh, no.

01:52:23.360 --> 01:52:24.360
No.

01:52:24.360 --> 01:52:25.360
Just reaction.

01:52:25.360 --> 01:52:26.360
Reaction is seven.

01:52:26.360 --> 01:52:27.360
Awesome.

01:52:27.360 --> 01:52:28.360
Where are you going?

01:52:28.360 --> 01:52:29.360
Where are you guys?

01:52:29.360 --> 01:52:30.360
What are you doing?

01:52:30.360 --> 01:52:32.360
And there's also only two people in the vehicle.

01:52:32.360 --> 01:52:33.360
Are you guys going to get in or...

01:52:33.360 --> 01:52:34.360
I'll get in.

01:52:34.360 --> 01:52:35.360
We can get in the back of the truck.

01:52:35.360 --> 01:52:36.360
I'm getting them back.

01:52:36.360 --> 01:52:37.360
But where are we going?

01:52:37.360 --> 01:52:38.360
I got a bird flying around out there.

01:52:38.360 --> 01:52:40.360
Are we going to take it back to the rusty bucket?

01:52:40.360 --> 01:52:43.360
You're supposed to take it to the neutral drop zone.

01:52:43.360 --> 01:52:46.360
However, you don't know the location of the neutral drop zone at the moment.

01:52:46.360 --> 01:52:47.360
Oh, shit.

01:52:47.360 --> 01:52:49.360
We're going to check in with the Johnson.

01:52:49.360 --> 01:52:51.360
Mercy, you're a contact.

01:52:51.360 --> 01:52:54.360
Why don't you contact Mr. Johnson and say we got the BTLs.

01:52:54.360 --> 01:52:55.360
What's the deal with your spirit?

01:52:55.360 --> 01:52:56.360
What is it?

01:52:56.360 --> 01:53:01.360
My eagle spirit is looking around for Baldwin and see if he can find them escaping on foot

01:53:01.360 --> 01:53:02.360
or in car or something like that.

01:53:02.360 --> 01:53:03.360
Is it a real eagle?

01:53:03.360 --> 01:53:04.360
Okay.

01:53:04.360 --> 01:53:05.360
It's a spirit eagle.

01:53:05.360 --> 01:53:06.360
It's like...

01:53:06.360 --> 01:53:07.360
It's a little bird's eagle.

01:53:07.360 --> 01:53:08.360
Lord of the Rings.

01:53:08.360 --> 01:53:09.360
Right.

01:53:09.360 --> 01:53:10.360
I use my...

01:53:10.360 --> 01:53:11.360
I'm so sorry.

01:53:11.360 --> 01:53:12.360
I'm not doing it that...

01:53:12.360 --> 01:53:13.360
My Selby...

01:53:13.360 --> 01:53:14.360
What is the phone called?

01:53:14.360 --> 01:53:15.360
Comlink.

01:53:15.360 --> 01:53:16.360
Comlink.

01:53:16.360 --> 01:53:17.360
Comlink?

01:53:17.360 --> 01:53:18.360
No, link.

01:53:18.360 --> 01:53:19.360
Comlink.

01:53:19.360 --> 01:53:22.360
Like dot com is a web link.

01:53:22.360 --> 01:53:23.360
Comlink.

01:53:23.360 --> 01:53:24.360
Yup.

01:53:24.360 --> 01:53:25.360
I'm so sorry.

01:53:25.360 --> 01:53:31.360
I used that and I call the Johnson.

01:53:31.360 --> 01:53:33.360
Oh, you don't have his number.

01:53:33.360 --> 01:53:34.360
You have Teddy's number, though.

01:53:34.360 --> 01:53:36.360
He's the guy who put you in touch with the guys.

01:53:36.360 --> 01:53:37.360
Pardon.

01:53:37.360 --> 01:53:38.360
I call Teddy.

01:53:38.360 --> 01:53:41.360
He's like, hey guys, how's it going?

01:53:41.360 --> 01:53:42.360
Okay.

01:53:42.360 --> 01:53:46.360
Best wish mission that I can remember.

01:53:46.360 --> 01:53:47.360
Also the worst.

01:53:47.360 --> 01:53:48.360
Awesome.

01:53:48.360 --> 01:53:49.360
You found the...

01:53:49.360 --> 01:53:50.360
You found Baldwin there?

01:53:50.360 --> 01:53:52.360
You ready to go to the neutral drop zone?

01:53:52.360 --> 01:53:54.360
Funny about that.

01:53:54.360 --> 01:53:58.200
We have not found Baldwin per se.

01:53:58.200 --> 01:54:00.360
We have seen signs of Baldwin.

01:54:00.360 --> 01:54:03.360
Do you know where we may find him?

01:54:03.360 --> 01:54:04.360
That's our job.

01:54:04.360 --> 01:54:05.360
I could ask, but...

01:54:05.360 --> 01:54:06.360
I don't know.

01:54:06.360 --> 01:54:09.360
And I'm joking.

01:54:09.360 --> 01:54:13.360
Well, obviously we'll find him, but where's the...

01:54:13.360 --> 01:54:15.360
Where's the NDZ?

01:54:15.360 --> 01:54:19.360
I'm sending you the location of the neutral drop zone.

01:54:19.360 --> 01:54:21.360
You should be getting it on your comlinks.

01:54:21.360 --> 01:54:22.360
Cool.

01:54:22.360 --> 01:54:23.360
Cool.

01:54:23.360 --> 01:54:25.360
Did you finish hanging that shelf?

01:54:25.360 --> 01:54:26.360
What?

01:54:26.360 --> 01:54:27.360
All right.

01:54:27.360 --> 01:54:28.360
See you.

01:54:28.360 --> 01:54:29.360
Bye.

01:54:29.360 --> 01:54:30.360
Okay.

01:54:30.360 --> 01:54:34.360
So I got the link to the drop zone.

01:54:34.360 --> 01:54:37.360
It arrives on your comlinks.

01:54:37.360 --> 01:54:40.360
I show it to Hordegaard and we...

01:54:40.360 --> 01:54:42.360
I show it to Hordegaard.

01:54:42.360 --> 01:54:43.360
You do that.

01:54:43.360 --> 01:54:45.360
And you guys want to drive?

01:54:45.360 --> 01:54:46.360
Yes.

01:54:46.360 --> 01:54:47.360
Okay.

01:54:47.360 --> 01:54:49.360
We drive to the neutral drop zone.

01:54:49.360 --> 01:54:51.360
You drive to the neutral drop zone.

01:54:51.360 --> 01:54:53.360
But what will be there?

01:54:53.360 --> 01:54:54.360
Out there?

01:54:54.360 --> 01:54:55.360
Cliffhanger!

01:54:55.360 --> 01:54:56.360
Oh!

01:54:56.360 --> 01:54:57.360
Meg Ryan!

01:54:57.360 --> 01:55:01.360
We get to Shadowrun and Harmontown.

01:55:01.360 --> 01:55:03.360
Thank Meg Ryan for coming up here.

01:55:03.360 --> 01:55:06.360
It's been a busy night for her.

01:55:06.360 --> 01:55:11.360
Thank our other audience guest, Lana.

01:55:11.360 --> 01:55:13.360
What did you say?

01:55:13.360 --> 01:55:14.360
What?

01:55:14.360 --> 01:55:15.360
We had Lana.

01:55:15.360 --> 01:55:16.360
We had Dino Stamatopolous.

01:55:16.360 --> 01:55:18.360
Of course we had Dino, yeah.

01:55:18.360 --> 01:55:20.360
Spencer Crittenden, Erin McGathy.

01:55:20.360 --> 01:55:22.360
I'm Jeff Davis.

01:55:22.360 --> 01:55:25.360
Your mayor is Mr. Dan Hyland.

01:55:25.360 --> 01:55:32.360
Our technical director back there is Chris Last Namerson.

01:55:32.360 --> 01:55:35.360
And Justin Marshall is back there pulling the strings.

01:55:35.360 --> 01:55:37.360
Best of the finger in the world.

01:55:37.360 --> 01:55:39.360
We're all in the truck.

01:55:39.360 --> 01:55:43.360
And we didn't accomplish our mission that well.

01:55:43.360 --> 01:55:45.360
Got a bird flying in the sky.

01:55:45.360 --> 01:55:47.360
But we're driving away from him.

01:55:47.360 --> 01:55:51.360
So maybe I'll never see that bird again.

01:55:51.360 --> 01:55:53.360
Family.

01:55:53.360 --> 01:55:56.360
You got what I need.

01:55:56.360 --> 01:55:57.360
It's up.

01:55:57.360 --> 01:55:58.360
Give me the hub.

01:55:58.360 --> 01:56:00.360
Chip chop to the black.

01:56:00.360 --> 01:56:02.360
Good boy time locking druggies out.

01:56:02.360 --> 01:56:04.360
Then accomplishing our task.

01:56:04.360 --> 01:56:06.360
We didn't do what the people said.

01:56:06.360 --> 01:56:08.360
We didn't do anything that they asked.

01:56:08.360 --> 01:56:09.360
Family.

01:56:09.360 --> 01:56:10.360
We got in a car.

01:56:10.360 --> 01:56:12.360
We're driving until we don't know where.

01:56:12.360 --> 01:56:15.360
Now she's got a picture of a guy in her underwear.

01:56:15.360 --> 01:56:16.360
All right.

01:56:16.360 --> 01:56:17.360
Break it down.

01:56:17.360 --> 01:56:20.360
Hip hop, hip hop, hip hop till you stop.

01:56:20.360 --> 01:56:22.360
Hip hoppin' then you stop.

01:56:22.360 --> 01:56:24.360
Hip hop until you stop.

01:56:24.360 --> 01:56:26.360
Oh, look who it is.

01:56:26.360 --> 01:56:28.360
Hip hop, hip hop, hip hop till you stop.

01:56:28.360 --> 01:56:30.360
It's MC John.

01:56:30.360 --> 01:56:33.360
Everybody put your hands together for MC John.

01:56:33.360 --> 01:56:35.360
My name is MC John.

01:56:35.360 --> 01:56:37.360
At the Oscars on the lawn.

01:56:37.360 --> 01:56:39.360
Trimmin' hedges looking on.

01:56:39.360 --> 01:56:41.360
At all the stars before they're gone.

01:56:41.360 --> 01:56:43.360
In the Mulrainee.

01:56:43.360 --> 01:56:45.360
Robin Williams is gone.

01:56:45.360 --> 01:56:46.360
We loved him.

01:56:46.360 --> 01:56:47.360
It's sad.

01:56:47.360 --> 01:56:48.360
I'm MC John.

01:56:48.360 --> 01:56:49.360
I'm sad.

01:56:49.360 --> 01:56:51.360
We've lost some friends this year.

01:56:51.360 --> 01:56:52.360
I'm MC John.

01:56:52.360 --> 01:56:55.360
A tears coming down my cheek.

01:56:55.360 --> 01:56:58.360
I'm going to use it this week too.

01:56:58.360 --> 01:57:03.360
Learn about all the things that real people know.

01:57:06.360 --> 01:57:07.360
Good night everybody.

01:57:07.360 --> 01:57:08.360
Thank you for coming.

01:57:18.360 --> 01:57:20.360
Did you get any of that?

01:57:20.360 --> 01:57:25.360
It's a good show.
