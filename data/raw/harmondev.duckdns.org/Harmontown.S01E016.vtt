03:14.000\nwe Harmontown would reimburse him because it's a special thing it's like a social program\n\n03:14.000 --> 03:18.800\nI was thinking there's a very good chance he'd be the only black Jarrah so what's good is that\n\n03:18.800 --> 03:23.600\ndiversity program like whatever that wig cost whatever whatever whatever your gas costs you\n\n03:23.600 --> 03:28.400\nknow let's see us after the

03:47.360\nuh all right so uh you know let's not address this all night let's uh let's casually throw it over\n\n03:47.360 --> 03:58.240\nour shoulder can we talk about the construction of your vest if you want because because from middle\n\n03:58.240 --> 04:01.840\ndistance if you squint your eyes it's exactly the shape of the vest I just want to know about\n\n04:01.840 --> 04:10.080\nmore about the uh it's backstory it's origin for for those who uh for those who are only listening\n\n04:10.080 --> 04:21.120\nI I went for for Jarrah then I arrived at kind of a gay Han Solo by buying a woman's windbreaker\n\n04:21.120 --> 04:26.800\nand cutting it cutting it into the precise shape of David Bowie's what I would call his lead he\n\n04:26.800 --> 04:31.600\nwears several outfits he's like a male barbaralla he wears several outfits elaborate you never see\n\n04:31.600 --> 04:37.280\nhim in the same one twice uh I'm sure that was in his contract and uh he uh one of them and the\n\n04:37.280 --> 04:42.800\none where he sings dance magic dance um he's it's he's in kind of a leisure leisure throne wear\n\n04:42.800 --> 04:48.640\nand uh kind of kicking back and uh I would say you nailed it you got boots and everything yeah\n\n04:48.640 --> 04:55.920\nwell I I look closer I didn't get actual boots I got I got ladies boots from Goodwill cut the\n\n04:55.920 --> 05:01.680\ntops of them off because I couldn't find boots that would fit and put them over men's shoes over my\n\n05:01.680 --> 05:09.360\nBenz filler shoes you made labyrinth spats yep labyrinth spats spats labyrinth spats spats labyrinth\n\n05:09.360 --> 05:22.080\nspats put those magic spats on me I saw my boots too small to fit my manly feet what kind of came\n\n05:22.080 --> 05:31.360\nmy prop to you are you a jumbo juice lids glued into a sphere are you a are you a fan of the movie\n\n05:31.360 --> 05:37.920\nbecause I've only seen it about twice I and I've never I only saw the ending today\n\n05:40.800 --> 05:44.960\nit's a good ending because I always hated Sarah in it because she's kind of an unredemptive character\n\n05:44.960 --> 05:49.360\nuntil the bitter end of that thing I would she when she says like no I'd rather I don't want all\n\n05:49.360 --> 05:53.600\nmy wishes to come true I want to say as a baby right is that is that the idea yeah well I'll\n\n05:53.600 --> 05:59.520\ntell you it's a lot of it's a lot of bickering as a professional storyteller I I'm I'm really not\n\n05:59.520 --> 06:07.920\nallowed to like that movie but as a as a as a moviegoer as a fan of Hudson hawk in dock Hollywood\n\n06:09.360 --> 06:14.160\nI understand that it's Erin McGathy's favorite movie and wouldn't take that away from her she\n\n06:14.160 --> 06:19.120\nwas she has a passion for that movie that I would like until people of my generation's passion for\n\n06:19.120 --> 06:23.760\nthe goonies for instance right uh I'm not saying labyrinth people are a different generation of\n\n06:23.760 --> 06:29.040\njust saying like I never watched that labyrinth shit when I was a kid it looked a little I can't\n\n06:29.040 --> 06:37.600\nsay fruity that's homophobic it's a look looked uh look gay yeah uh wait wait wait to avoid fruity\n\n06:41.120 --> 06:46.560\nit looked like it was exercising it's god-given right to get married uh but to another movie\n\n06:46.560 --> 06:52.400\nwith with with the same sexual organs but as an adult now as a fan of David Bowie which I was not\n\n06:52.400 --> 06:56.960\nwhen I first saw that movie I didn't I didn't know Bowie uh like knowing Bowie now it's pretty cool\n\n06:56.960 --> 07:03.200\nlike because like because it's David Bowie like oh forget about the babies it's cooler now than it\n\n07:03.200 --> 07:08.720\nwas then to me I mean cool now it's cool now you wish that that a bad movies should always be that\n\n07:08.720 --> 07:13.680\ngood also that should be a special note I think well yeah time bandits is a good example too\n\n07:13.680 --> 07:19.040\nlike like like time bandits is incredible it's it's you know if you were to if if you were to say\n\n07:19.040 --> 07:23.600\nI don't like time bandits there's guys that won't date you no matter how hot you are\n\n07:23.600 --> 07:28.720\nlike there's a deal breaker for them they won't do it like a beautiful woman walks up to them you\n\n07:28.720 --> 07:35.360\ncould the guy could have two heads and like an extra butt or something and um and and just have no\n\n07:35.360 --> 07:39.200\nchance of ever procreating and then there's like a supermodel could walk up to him and there's\n\n07:39.200 --> 07:44.240\npeople out there that she would say I don't I don't like time bandits I prefer Kevin Smith dogma\n\n07:44.240 --> 07:47.920\nand uh and then there's there's people out there they're that passionate about time bandits that\n\n07:47.920 --> 07:54.160\nthey would they would tell her to take a hike take a beautiful hike and uh I I don't know if I would\n\n07:54.160 --> 07:58.480\ncount myself in there I'm too old to care uh what what what movies you like or don't like although\n\n07:58.480 --> 08:05.120\nif you said you like dogma I'd probably tell you to go fuck yourself I think just just I just it's\n\n08:05.120 --> 08:09.680\na slippery slope like like conversationally down the road like what kind of shit am I gonna have\n\n08:09.680 --> 08:14.720\nto listen to if you think dogma is a good movie is it possible you're gonna think my face is a\n\n08:14.720 --> 08:21.920\nsandwich am I gonna wake up to you eating my face it has nothing to do with tasted movies I don't\n\n08:21.920 --> 08:27.200\nwant to assert mine over years I just want to make sure I don't get murdered because the disparity\n\n08:27.200 --> 08:34.400\nbetween dogma and a good film is similar to my face and a fucking sandwich is that much does that\n\n08:34.400 --> 08:40.560\nmuch difference happening just move your hands away from your your bolds you make a profile there\n\n08:44.480 --> 08:52.320\nperfect sorry I was just photographing Sarah don't you know that magic is in my ball\n\n08:55.040 --> 09:01.440\nI've seen it twice too uh the uh the the other thing I was gonna say it's a movie about a about a\n\n09:01.440 --> 09:08.000\ngirl that doesn't like babysitting she wishes her favorite curse she's a very unlikable protagonist\n\n09:08.000 --> 09:12.720\nshe and she wishes a goblin to take the baby away for good because she hates babysitting\n\n09:12.720 --> 09:16.960\nand then David Bowie comes in with an owl and he says I'm fucking I got your baby he says like\n\n09:16.960 --> 09:25.440\nyou told me I only did what you told me to do Sarah I took the baby you have till 12 o'clock\n\n09:25.440 --> 09:32.480\nto try to get it back 13 o'clock and so 13 o'clock goblin goblin time uh the uh\n\n09:34.320 --> 09:38.480\nthe the uh and then and then I don't know why well we do know why it gives her a time limit\n\n09:38.480 --> 09:42.880\nbecause this is my problem with the movie as he establishes in the third act it's like look\n\n09:42.880 --> 09:48.240\nyou just you created me I just do whatever you want that's like one of those movies right here\n\n09:48.240 --> 09:55.200\nwe're running from the vampire and somebody goes wait we have to have faith we just have to stop\n\n09:55.200 --> 10:01.200\nbeing afraid and then it's our fear and then she remembers I'm not afraid well then I'll go home\n\n10:03.200 --> 10:07.920\nchecking out in the monster clock that's that's not a story wait it's 40 year old David Bowie\n\n10:07.920 --> 10:12.080\nfalling in love with her or she falling in love with him or both they but well he's a manifestation\n\n10:12.080 --> 10:18.000\nof her so he's he's like a metaphor for her her experimenting with the cucumber I don't know like\n\n10:18.000 --> 10:28.480\nhe's he's he's a 13 year old girl's version of a man so he looks like a he looks like this\n\n10:29.920 --> 10:31.840\nwell a little better he looks a little better\n\n10:35.280 --> 10:37.840\nI wasn't fishing for salmon so don't give me a boot\n\n10:39.120 --> 10:41.840\nand coined it coined a new colloquial phrase\n\n10:41.840 --> 10:50.720\num the Jim hent jim henson is the star of labyrinth much as any omora cone is the star of any uh\n\n10:50.720 --> 10:54.480\nwait

those movies really be jim henson is the star of labyrinth\n\n11:08.560 --> 11:12.400\nit's like he's doing some amazing things like oh there's a mouse writing a fucking pickle or\n\n11:12.400 --> 11:16.720\nsomething and uh this is like they did it by making using a regular sized mouse and then\n\n11:16.720 --> 11:20.880\nin the close-ups it's a the the pickles got human feet coming out of it i don't know it's\n\n11:20.880 --> 11:26.320\nnot my passion it's not i i don't i believe it's that's that stuff is a it's a it's a scam that's\n\n11:26.320 --> 11:34.320\nthat's Schrab shit i gotta tell you Schrab shit rob Schrab shit you're uh i just i'm looking at you\n\n11:34.320 --> 11:41.840\nand and uh that that wig is almost lani anderson it's it's a little it's 40 percent lani

that's we might be getting the\n\n18:24.640 --> 18:28.240\nlast of henry he's still with us and he looks exactly the same he's gonna outlive us all\n\n18:28.960 --> 18:33.280\nhe uh i didn't know this but he has a glass eye and i wasn't there but one time he was there in\n\n18:33.280 --> 18:38.880\nthe daytime and he coughed or sneezed and the couple people at the bar her ting ting ting\n\n18:38.880 --> 18:44.400\nting ting ting ting and his eyeball had shot across the bar and then landed on the bar mat\n\n18:44.400 --> 18:48.960\nlike down on the ground there which is even grosser possibly than the carpet that was still there at\n\n18:48.960 --> 18:52.960\nthe time and the bartender and he was like looking around for it and he doesn't know where it sat\n\n18:52.960 --> 18:57.200\nand the bartender picked it up washed it off and gave it to him and he went put it right back in\n\n18:58.240 --> 19:05.920\nthat's a good bar yeah that's my kind of shit it's a bar so vile that hipsters will never take\n\n19:05.920 --> 19:11.760\nit over yeah the gauntlet's been thrown down and one of the few bars that boast a women's room\n\n19:11.760 --> 19:17.600\nit smells worse than a men's room i've only been in the women's room once but that men's room holy\n\n19:17.600 --> 19:24.000\ntamale yeah there's bugs in there that don't exist outside of the men's room of the driver yeah do\n\n19:24.000 --> 19:27.360\nyou know there's a weird theory about that like there's bugs that fly in your face when you're\n\n19:27.360 --> 19:32.400\nstanding at the urinal and he he thinks he thinks that the reason they're there is because of the\n\n19:32.400 --> 19:37.040\npee that is on the wall because you can never hit the urinal because there's bugs in your face\n\n19:37.040 --> 19:43.040\nso he thinks it's a whole biosphere that the it's like an amazing darwinian evolution that\n\n19:43.040 --> 19:47.840\nthat that like these bugs have evolved like no they're i mean they don't know but the same way\n\n19:47.840 --> 19:52.160\nlike there's birds that drop walnuts into traffic so that the the cars crack the walnuts and then\n\n19:52.160 --> 19:57.760\nthey eat the nut meat these these these bugs they they literally live for one day so like like\n\n19:57.760 --> 20:02.080\nlike last 30 years of the drawing room people peeing has been like a millennia to them yeah\n\n20:02.080 --> 20:06.880\nso you you bet you bet it's a possibility there used to be doors in there but but the bar opens\n\n20:06.880 --> 20:11.120\nat 6am and it boasts cocktail lounge open at 6am and so i think a lot of druggies were going in\n\n20:11.120 --> 20:15.360\nthere and so the doors are now off there so you can't go in there and do drugs uh but now it's\n\n20:15.360 --> 20:19.760\nturning this weird kind of like men's shower like the whole thing has been designed so when people\n\n20:19.760 --> 20:24.240\npuke or pee all over the place because they will clean the bathroom there it'll be spick and span\n\n20:24.240 --> 20:31.120\nand 10 seconds later there is a three foot like like like a three point line of piss around the\n\n20:31.120 --> 20:35.040\nthing like you can't get close to it and then it then it's just receding because now no one\n\n20:35.040 --> 20:38.960\nwants to step on the pee right now people are progressively peeing farther away when things\n\n20:38.960 --> 20:43.040\nthey can hang from the rafters and be the cleanest monkey to get out of the drawing room bathroom\n\n20:43.040 --> 20:48.160\nso then it's just like it's it's just this uh this exponential piss cycle that goes on\n\n20:48.160 --> 20:51.920\nthere so they designed the whole thing now where you they have a thing they hook up which is like\n\n20:51.920 --> 20:55.840\na car wash where they just go in and steam the whole thing down yeah and they just rinse the\n\n20:55.840 --> 21:00.400\nwhole thing down and then it's you know shiny and new and then 10 seconds later because the more\n\n21:00.400 --> 21:05.200\nthey do that it's the broken window theory in new york you know if the pre-guliani whole thing was\n\n21:05.200 --> 21:09.280\nthe idea of the the neighborhoods have a tipping point if you're walking down the streets covered\n\n21:09.280 --> 21:12.800\nwith garbage and all the windows are broken like you'll break a window you don't give a shit if\n\n21:12.800 --> 21:16.960\nyou walked on a pristine street there's that sort of i think it's i don't think it's that that gallant\n\n21:16.960 --> 21:20.640\nof us i think we're just afraid to be the first person i think you know just i think it's just\n\n21:20.640 --> 21:25.760\nsort of like cowardice and like and you can see it in european bathrooms i swear i went to europe\n\n21:25.760 --> 21:29.840\nfor the first time a couple years ago and i was just marveling i was like i went to dive bars the\n\n21:29.840 --> 21:35.200\nbathrooms are still a little cleaner than the dive bars in america and i and my my girlfriend at the\n\n21:35.200 --> 21:43.680\ntime said that her her theory was that americans are more germaphobic too so we tend to try to\n\n21:43.680 --> 21:48.640\ntake shits and peas without touching anything and we end up making everything worse and the\n\n21:48.640 --> 21:53.520\ncycle continues there's europeans are like hey it's my butt it's your butt you know i don't know\n\n21:53.520 --> 22:00.640\nwhat i'm we're both from chanselvania uh there were uh thoughts to the same piece of plastic\n\n22:01.280 --> 22:05.760\nthere were uh paper

movies worked back then but you it wasn't like you it was his previous but somehow we had\n\n25:03.600 --> 25:09.040\nhalloween at our house and i couldn't have been more than six or seven years old and we watched\n\n25:09.040 --> 25:13.200\nthat and that movie really screwed me up and i had like is the thing about uh what's his name\n\n25:13.200 --> 25:17.600\nmichael meyers yeah the thing about him is he's supernatural because as soon as you look away\n\n25:17.600 --> 25:22.240\nhe's there you know he's he moves like a ghost he just happened like like you turn your head\n\n25:22.240 --> 25:26.960\nand he sits up on the couch and it's scary like he's just he's got that ghostly inside out william\n\n25:26.960 --> 25:32.960\nshatner mask and it's uh it's freaky and and i was just too young to watch it i don't think it\n\n25:32.960 --> 25:37.280\nwould have scared me if i watched it when i was 15 because no other movies scare me at all when i\n\n25:37.280 --> 25:40.640\nwas 18 years old my friends were having a party and they're like we're gonna watch scary movies i'm\n\n25:40.640 --> 25:43.840\nlike what are you watching they go we're gonna watch halloween i'm like you know what i'm 18\n\n25:43.840 --> 25:50.160\nyears old i'm an adult and then college i'm gonna i'm gonna watch this shit and fucking three more\n\n25:50.160 --> 25:54.960\nmonths of looking over both shoulders like uh turn turn the light off when you when you go to bed\n\n25:54.960 --> 25:59.200\nand then turn it back on again and turn it off and turn it on again they go maybe maybe maybe\n\n25:59.200 --> 26:04.480\ndive into the bed like for real i was a grown man and i won't watch it and even like when it's on\n\n26:04.480 --> 26:08.560\nlike those commercials for it and i see that mask it's like i just like it just represents me looking\n\n26:08.560 --> 26:12.080\nover my shoulder like i was too young for that i don't think there's anything that scares me like\n\n26:12.080 --> 26:16.800\nthat i just don't like those modern horror movies modern like now it's probably like 20 years old\n\n26:16.800 --> 26:24.560\nbut like event horizon is a perfect example in one of these you're laughing because it's my i said\n\n26:24.560 --> 26:30.880\nmodern when i was talking about event horizon um the i rented it at blockbuster that that's new\n\n26:32.320 --> 26:36.960\nwhat is event horizon about i've never heard it it's about a spaceship that can go faster than the\n\n26:36.960 --> 26:41.840\nspeed of light but it turns out when you go faster than the speed of light you go through hell uh\n\n26:42.720 --> 26:47.440\nbecause because time stops or whatever hell being defined as whatever ookey bookey like\n\n26:47.440 --> 26:52.320\nlike whatever uh thing you you know when you're greatest fears or regrets or dead wives or so\n\n26:52.320 --> 26:56.400\neverybody aboard the ship of course has a lost a popsicle once and then they see a popsicle\n\n26:57.360 --> 27:03.280\nit's a dumb movie but this is the thing about about modern horror as opposed to john carpenter's\n\n27:03.280 --> 27:11.440\nstuff um uh that was pop the champagne this is john carpenter just fucking the masters of horror\n\n27:11.440 --> 27:17.760\nin the back will never be dethroned boys john carpenter goes into every location with some\n\n27:17.760 --> 27:22.160\nchampagne in case someone mentioned it just in case i he's he's he's been he's been he's wasted\n\n27:22.160 --> 27:28.560\nsix hours this week watching uh joneray stand up just waiting that champagne's so hot and flat\n\n27:28.560 --> 27:33.600\nit's not even worth drinking right because that's superboli it's just holding it all time this patent\n\n27:33.600 --> 27:39.120\nas well guy goes on forever well just say something about me john carpenter let me pop this\n\n27:39.120 --> 27:46.880\nfucker it's it's it's it's it's from 1948 um the uh the event horizon these these these new horror\n\n27:46.880 --> 27:54.960\nmovies as i call them uh the thing is that they go like like you know the guy i'll be looking the\n\n27:54.960 --> 27:59.600\nthe mirror in his medicine chest he's brushing his teeth and then he'll he'll close the medicine\n\n27:59.600 --> 28:03.920\nchest door oh and you're expecting to see a thing no you don't see a thing and he's like\n\n28:03.920 --> 28:10.000\nlooking in the mirror and then it just hard cuts to like a a you know different lighting of a woman\n\n28:10.000 --> 28:16.400\nwith blood streaming down her face and it just goes it just it just it's not that's not fear\n\n28:16.400 --> 28:22.080\nthat's startling yeah that's just that's just that's just a thumbtack on your on your chair it\n\n28:22.080 --> 28:27.040\ndoesn't it doesn't count it doesn't i don't like that i don't like being startled in a movie you\n\n28:27.040 --> 28:30.960\ncould do that you could that doesn't take any craftsmanship how old are you when you first saw\n\n28:30.960 --> 28:40.560\na labyrinth erin oh um uh thanks for cheering for age uh i i was six seven did it scare you\n\n28:40.560 --> 28:44.400\num the first scene and the better you see it seems pretty scary for kids in the beginning\n\n28:44.400 --> 28:52.720\nyeah i noticed that as the writer of monster house i have a keen eye for this stuff i wrote a movie that\n\n28:54.880 --> 28:58.720\nevery time i'm in this every time my friend mentions his own movies i pop champagne\n\n29:01.840 --> 29:07.280\nkids get scared pretty easily little kids even even in even in this post horse dick internet world\n\n29:07.280 --> 29:15.920\nof of of they've seen everything little little kids still get scared phd um post horse dick after\n\n29:15.920 --> 29:21.120\nlabrith nothing was post dick because it's just bulge and he's bouncing he's bouncing an infant\n\n29:21.120 --> 29:27.120\non a just a rigid con piece the entire time it's really it's really horny he's he's he's older than\n\n29:27.120 --> 29:31.280\ni am in that movie right how old is bowie in that movie he's gotta be older than 39 right i don't know\n\n29:31.280 --> 29:37.360\nbut but and he's coming on to it's like what 15 year old 14 she's she's she's 14 but but he's\n\n29:37.360 --> 29:46.560\nher fantasy and he's her fantasy yes also he's i watched the uh behind the scenes documentary\n\n29:46.560 --> 29:56.160\nagain today and uh it's it's uh monday tomorrow's vitamin day i'm gonna watch vitamins all day\n\n29:56.160 --> 30:03.280\ntomorrow um so bowie's talking about the goblin king and he he says uh well he he doesn't choose\n\n30:04.000 --> 30:08.400\nto to have her there he's reluctant but then he's forced into this way like he his explanation\n\n30:08.400 --> 30:12.960\nwas nothing that i think anyone has ever thought like he was he sat down with jim henson jim henson's\n\n30:12.960 --> 30:19.040\nlike yeah fine that's that's your explanation that the goblin king uh doesn't want to be the\n\n30:19.040 --> 30:25.520\ngoblin king but because he's there he may as well do a good job and um so that's you know\n\n30:25.520 --> 30:29.680\nyeah jennifer connelly was to me that the goblin king spends most of his time hanging out in a\n\n30:29.680 --> 30:35.600\ndungeon with 50 asshole puppets yeah yeah well now you know why because half of the movie was\n\n30:35.600 --> 30:43.600\nwritten by a fucking guitarist uh for real i'm just saying you want a good story don't go to\n\n30:43.600 --> 30:48.240\nyou know david bowie well david bowie didn't write the story charry jones charry jones wrote the\n\n30:48.240 --> 30:53.120\nmovie he came up with the character like like motivation that's the thing about the movie\n\n30:53.120 --> 30:58.160\nthat doesn't make any sense to me there's no stakes we call them you know as we say it uh at\n\n30:58.160 --> 31:04.240\ndenny's end in writing there's you need stakes back to time that is the biggest is the biggest\n\n31:04.880 --> 31:09.600\nlabyrinth fan out here who other than erin so someone think that they're a bigger labyrinth fan\n\n31:09.600 --> 31:19.360\nthan erin john carpenter it's bj oh my god it's john carpenter come on up here john carpenter\n\n31:19.360 --> 31:26.320\nyeah we got john carpenter's in the house uh bj wow you're looking very front a surprise special\n\n31:26.320 --> 31:30.880\nno it's john carpenter wait i don't know what's really really what are we talking about labyrinth\n\n31:30.880 --> 31:40.640\nyou're gonna stick up your labyrinth yeah one humans and puppets together but real not like the\n\n31:40.640 --> 31:51.120\nmuppets wait no no no exactly like the muppets it's exactly like the muppets they're both as real\n\n31:51.120 --> 32:00.400\nas each other no no the muppets are actors so two you've got oh i see oh the muppets are playing\n\n32:00.400 --> 32:06.960\nactors it's not like the larry sanders show they're not well it kind of is it's kind of behind the\n\n32:06.960 --> 32:13.520\nscenes that is uh john carpenter do you mean uh there are there are little people that are playing\n\n32:13.520 --> 32:19.040\nthe puppets is that what you mean like it's different and that's nope no no no i'm saying\n\n32:19.040 --> 32:28.480\nuh fuzzy bear right um kermit miss piggy animals in a band so he's a musician but they're they're\n\n32:28.480 --> 32:34.720\nactors they're not oh they're actually on the muppet show yeah so like when you see them like oh\n\n32:34.720 --> 32:42.800\nwe gotta get to new york or whatever it's like yeah because you're actors oh you're saying that\n\n32:42.800 --> 32:48.240\nit isn't every man which you obviously are you're you find it less relatable to watch a show biz\n\n32:48.240 --> 32:54.960\nshow there's more very similar to it when the puppets are goblins that when puppets are actors\n\n32:54.960 --> 33:02.320\nthat's crazy in the uh in the behind the scenes documentary uh jim henson is talking about why\n\n33:02.320 --> 33:07.440\nhe wanted to make the movie anyway and him and terry jones say like well like we just wanted\n\n33:07.440 --> 33:14.160\nto make a movie again with puppets and people that's like dirt crystal but fun and goblins maybe\n\n33:14.160 --> 33:19.200\nlike it was such a loose idea and so great but then it became such a great movie i was sitting\n\n33:19.200 --> 33:24.480\nout at the the pikey the bar a couple blocks up the uh the street as uh here on the sunset\n\n33:24.480 --> 33:28.960\nboulevard as i do every Harmontown and uh i was sitting there by myself at the bar\n\n33:28.960 --> 33:33.520\nthere's a little out of place on a monday uh it's not nothing because two days before halloween\n\n33:33.520 --> 33:39.440\nit's not

countless generations now to think that this is how we express our personalities\n\n44:50.720 --> 44:55.760\nand that we're either right or wrong like that we have favorite movies and movies are good or bad\n\n44:55.760 --> 45:00.800\nand we argue about them you can see that reflected in the politics too it's like we're we're being\n\n45:00.800 --> 45:07.440\nhad i mean you're you're allowed to
