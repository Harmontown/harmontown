01:39.120 --> 01:45.440
Harmontown.com is not up yet but you know go somewhere and look at a photo of us very unusual

01:54.480 --> 02:02.800
course a grower not a shower meaning I have a tiny penis that that that sort of recedes into a nipple

02:04.400 --> 02:14.720
above my giant ball sack so what I did is I found a dog toy that I kind of anchored the

02:14.720 --> 02:19.600
good news is this is being well photographed from the front row so it's kind of in a low

02:19.600 --> 02:31.440
slung twine harness let's see the harness we'll be giving this and many other things away

02:33.200 --> 02:40.160
they're not the show I'm not gonna I'm not gonna express disappointment with the with the with the

02:40.160 --> 02:47.120
lack of Jarrah so what I will do is express joy and support for the Jarrah's that did show up

02:47.120 --> 02:53.680
let's let's how I stand up stand up Jarrah's be seen one two three four five six seven nine

02:53.680 --> 03:05.040
ten oh black we have a black Jarrah and she and she said on twitter that uh that he wasn't

03:05.040 --> 03:09.280
going to have time or you said you didn't have the money or to put into a jarrah costume I said

03:09.280 --> 03:14.000
we Harmontown would reimburse him because it's a special thing it's like a social program

03:14.000 --> 03:18.800
I was thinking there's a very good chance he'd be the only black Jarrah so what's good is that

03:18.800 --> 03:23.600
diversity program like whatever that wig cost whatever whatever whatever your gas costs you

03:23.600 --> 03:28.400
know let's see us after the show as great as even a white Jarrah gets into Tina Turner country

03:33.680 --> 03:39.760
yeah if nt and I switched wigs uh yeah I'd still be there Ramon and he'd be Tina Turner

03:39.760 --> 03:47.360
uh all right so uh you know let's not address this all night let's uh let's casually throw it over

03:47.360 --> 03:58.240
our shoulder can we talk about the construction of your vest if you want because because from middle

03:58.240 --> 04:01.840
distance if you squint your eyes it's exactly the shape of the vest I just want to know about

04:01.840 --> 04:10.080
more about the uh it's backstory it's origin for for those who uh for those who are only listening

04:10.080 --> 04:21.120
I I went for for Jarrah then I arrived at kind of a gay Han Solo by buying a woman's windbreaker

04:21.120 --> 04:26.800
and cutting it cutting it into the precise shape of David Bowie's what I would call his lead he

04:26.800 --> 04:31.600
wears several outfits he's like a male barbaralla he wears several outfits elaborate you never see

04:31.600 --> 04:37.280
him in the same one twice uh I'm sure that was in his contract and uh he uh one of them and the

04:37.280 --> 04:42.800
one where he sings dance magic dance um he's it's he's in kind of a leisure leisure throne wear

04:42.800 --> 04:48.640
and uh kind of kicking back and uh I would say you nailed it you got boots and everything yeah

04:48.640 --> 04:55.920
well I I look closer I didn't get actual boots I got I got ladies boots from Goodwill cut the

04:55.920 --> 05:01.680
tops of them off because I couldn't find boots that would fit and put them over men's shoes over my

05:01.680 --> 05:09.360
Benz filler shoes you made labyrinth spats yep labyrinth spats spats labyrinth spats spats labyrinth

05:09.360 --> 05:22.080
spats put those magic spats on me I saw my boots too small to fit my manly feet what kind of came

05:22.080 --> 05:31.360
my prop to you are you a jumbo juice lids glued into a sphere are you a are you a fan of the movie

05:31.360 --> 05:37.920
because I've only seen it about twice I and I've never I only saw the ending today

05:40.800 --> 05:44.960
it's a good ending because I always hated Sarah in it because she's kind of an unredemptive character

05:44.960 --> 05:49.360
until the bitter end of that thing I would she when she says like no I'd rather I don't want all

05:49.360 --> 05:53.600
my wishes to come true I want to say as a baby right is that is that the idea yeah well I'll

05:53.600 --> 05:59.520
tell you it's a lot of it's a lot of bickering as a professional storyteller I I'm I'm really not

05:59.520 --> 06:07.920
allowed to like that movie but as a as a as a moviegoer as a fan of Hudson hawk in dock Hollywood

06:09.360 --> 06:14.160
I understand that it's Erin McGathy's favorite movie and wouldn't take that away from her she

06:14.160 --> 06:19.120
was she has a passion for that movie that I would like until people of my generation's passion for

06:19.120 --> 06:23.760
the goonies for instance right uh I'm not saying labyrinth people are a different generation of

06:23.760 --> 06:29.040
just saying like I never watched that labyrinth shit when I was a kid it looked a little I can't

06:29.040 --> 06:37.600
say fruity that's homophobic it's a look looked uh look gay yeah uh wait wait wait to avoid fruity

06:41.120 --> 06:46.560
it looked like it was exercising it's god-given right to get married uh but to another movie

06:46.560 --> 06:52.400
with with with the same sexual organs but as an adult now as a fan of David Bowie which I was not

06:52.400 --> 06:56.960
when I first saw that movie I didn't I didn't know Bowie uh like knowing Bowie now it's pretty cool

06:56.960 --> 07:03.200
like because like because it's David Bowie like oh forget about the babies it's cooler now than it

07:03.200 --> 07:08.720
was then to me I mean cool now it's cool now you wish that that a bad movies should always be that

07:08.720 --> 07:13.680
good also that should be a special note I think well yeah time bandits is a good example too

07:13.680 --> 07:19.040
like like like time bandits is incredible it's it's you know if you were to if if you were to say

07:19.040 --> 07:23.600
I don't like time bandits there's guys that won't date you no matter how hot you are

07:23.600 --> 07:28.720
like there's a deal breaker for them they won't do it like a beautiful woman walks up to them you

07:28.720 --> 07:35.360
could the guy could have two heads and like an extra butt or something and um and and just have no

07:35.360 --> 07:39.200
chance of ever procreating and then there's like a supermodel could walk up to him and there's

07:39.200 --> 07:44.240
people out there that she would say I don't I don't like time bandits I prefer Kevin Smith dogma

07:44.240 --> 07:47.920
and uh and then there's there's people out there they're that passionate about time bandits that

07:47.920 --> 07:54.160
they would they would tell her to take a hike take a beautiful hike and uh I I don't know if I would

07:54.160 --> 07:58.480
count myself in there I'm too old to care uh what what what movies you like or don't like although

07:58.480 --> 08:05.120
if you said you like dogma I'd probably tell you to go fuck yourself I think just just I just it's

08:05.120 --> 08:09.680
a slippery slope like like conversationally down the road like what kind of shit am I gonna have

08:09.680 --> 08:14.720
to listen to if you think dogma is a good movie is it possible you're gonna think my face is a

08:14.720 --> 08:21.920
sandwich am I gonna wake up to you eating my face it has nothing to do with tasted movies I don't

08:21.920 --> 08:27.200
want to assert mine over years I just want to make sure I don't get murdered because the disparity

08:27.200 --> 08:34.400
between dogma and a good film is similar to my face and a fucking sandwich is that much does that

08:34.400 --> 08:40.560
much difference happening just move your hands away from your your bolds you make a profile there

08:44.480 --> 08:52.320
perfect sorry I was just photographing Sarah don't you know that magic is in my ball

08:55.040 --> 09:01.440
I've seen it twice too uh the uh the the other thing I was gonna say it's a movie about a about a

09:01.440 --> 09:08.000
girl that doesn't like babysitting she wishes her favorite curse she's a very unlikable protagonist

09:08.000 --> 09:12.720
she and she wishes a goblin to take the baby away for good because she hates babysitting

09:12.720 --> 09:16.960
and then David Bowie comes in with an owl and he says I'm fucking I got your baby he says like

09:16.960 --> 09:25.440
you told me I only did what you told me to do Sarah I took the baby you have till 12 o'clock

09:25.440 --> 09:32.480
to try to get it back 13 o'clock and so 13 o'clock goblin goblin time uh the uh

09:34.320 --> 09:38.480
the the uh and then and then I don't know why well we do know why it gives her a time limit

09:38.480 --> 09:42.880
because this is my problem with the movie as he establishes in the third act it's like look

09:42.880 --> 09:48.240
you just you created me I just do whatever you want that's like one of those movies right here

09:48.240 --> 09:55.200
we're running from the vampire and somebody goes wait we have to have faith we just have to stop

09:55.200 --> 10:01.200
being afraid and then it's our fear and then she remembers I'm not afraid well then I'll go home

10:03.200 --> 10:07.920
checking out in the monster clock that's that's not a story wait it's 40 year old David Bowie

10:07.920 --> 10:12.080
falling in love with her or she falling in love with him or both they but well he's a manifestation

10:12.080 --> 10:18.000
of her so he's he's like a metaphor for her her experimenting with the cucumber I don't know like

10:18.000 --> 10:28.480
he's he's he's a 13 year old girl's version of a man so he looks like a he looks like this

10:29.920 --> 10:31.840
well a little better he looks a little better

10:35.280 --> 10:37.840
I wasn't fishing for salmon so don't give me a boot

10:39.120 --> 10:41.840
and coined it coined a new colloquial phrase

10:41.840 --> 10:50.720
um the Jim hent jim henson is the star of labyrinth much as any omora cone is the star of any uh

10:50.720 --> 10:54.480
wait i'm getting that wrong no any omora cone is the star of all this forget what was the

10:54.480 --> 10:58.880
guy that directed the spaghetti westerns sergio leone sergio leone you see a sergio leone

10:58.880 --> 11:03.360
omori akoni is the yeah he's the real star of a lot of the spaghetti westerns like without the

11:03.360 --> 11:08.560
morricone music you know what would some of those movies really be jim henson is the star of labyrinth

11:08.560 --> 11:12.400
it's like he's doing some amazing things like oh there's a mouse writing a fucking pickle or

11:12.400 --> 11:16.720
something and uh this is like they did it by making using a regular sized mouse and then

11:16.720 --> 11:20.880
in the close-ups it's a the the pickles got human feet coming out of it i don't know it's

11:20.880 --> 11:26.320
not my passion it's not i i don't i believe it's that's that stuff is a it's a it's a scam that's

11:26.320 --> 11:34.320
that's Schrab shit i gotta tell you Schrab shit rob Schrab shit you're uh i just i'm looking at you

11:34.320 --> 11:41.840

11:49.840 --> 11:57.040
about race uh let's talk about race let's talk about hoggle the the swarthy little uh fellow

11:57.040 --> 12:01.600
that loves gold and jewelry yeah and like kind of bargains his way yeah well george lucas knocked

12:01.600 --> 12:07.360
him off the map with his like weird semitic uh desert desert bargainer episode one yeah and

12:16.160 --> 12:22.320
with my chickney this is a this is a way to use the force uh that was no good

12:23.600 --> 12:27.600
and then we went out of the hoggle beat him to that punch i would say beat him to the punch but

12:27.600 --> 12:32.960
then like no one remembers the first punch after it's like george lucas chopped to the

12:32.960 --> 12:40.080

13:31.440 --> 13:36.400
the kind of vanna white our costume uh acknowledgement i won't even call it a contest

13:36.400 --> 13:41.680
so let's just let's just make sure i feel like everyone's got a a a reasonable expectation of

13:41.680 --> 13:47.600
of of of a brief 15 uh seconds of stardom uh if they if they put on some eye shadow and a wig

13:47.600 --> 13:51.520
tonight there's at least one person out there that looks exactly like jareth from the movie labyrinth

13:52.240 --> 13:56.560
by the way jeff and we haven't acknowledged for the podcast listeners that jeff is wearing uh

13:56.560 --> 14:06.720
what looks like a $50,000 jareth costume

14:06.720 --> 14:14.320
he he it's it's not really a costume it's just jareth he went he went he went out and commissioned

14:15.280 --> 14:19.600
people's help and he looks he looks kind of like he's a passable david bowie in the first place

14:19.600 --> 14:24.480
so with the eye shadow and the wig he looks like if this was a labyrinth reunion and you said like

14:24.480 --> 14:29.760
jareth stunt doubles here it should be said that the three of us watch this movie because i really

14:29.760 --> 14:36.000
wanted them to see it and i don't i think i i don't know but like the idea of us dressing like

14:36.000 --> 14:40.560
jareth came up and jeff was really enthusiastic about it and i think that's because he knows

14:40.560 --> 14:46.880
it was in my wheelhouse yeah oh i see that's like let's like what if people are doing karaoke and

14:46.880 --> 14:53.840

16:51.760 --> 16:55.840
that not enough people dressed as jareth at first but then 20 people got up here that was that was

16:55.840 --> 17:01.200

17:02.080 --> 17:06.160
uh that we all go to a bar afterwards and i'll take over a bar dressed as jareth

17:07.120 --> 17:11.520

17:20.560 --> 17:27.120
yeah uh Harmontown is kind of unofficially sponsored by the drawing room guest of Harmon

17:27.120 --> 17:34.160
town uh uh remember to tie your shoes before you go to the men's room yeah if you because if you

17:34.160 --> 17:42.080
tie them after hepsi yeah the drawing room where if you drop your keys you get to walk home because

17:43.680 --> 17:48.400
some sort of vermin will steal your car it's uh it's it's you don't want to touch anything you

17:48.400 --> 17:52.720
drop with the drawing room yeah there's a there's a there was a carpet there once and they never

17:52.720 --> 17:58.080
tore it up but it's not there anymore yeah they just let it go they just let people walk it all

17:58.080 --> 18:02.240
the way off yeah there were a couple little tuffs like near the booths and they finally some guy

18:02.240 --> 18:07.760
what was like a putting knife and got like the last little vestiges of the carpet there there's a

18:07.760 --> 18:11.920
guy that goes there and his name is henry and he's a lovely lovely old dude and he's been there he's

18:11.920 --> 18:15.680
going there for he's gone there forever and i remember going there maybe 10 12 years ago

18:15.680 --> 18:19.840
and not cynically i just thought this guy's probably we're not he's not going to be around

18:19.840 --> 18:24.640
much longer he's he's he's he's old and he drinks a lot and he's that's we might be getting the

18:24.640 --> 18:28.240
last of henry he's still with us and he looks exactly the same he's gonna outlive us all

18:28.960 --> 18:33.280
he uh i didn't know this but he has a glass eye and i wasn't there but one time he was there in

18:33.280 --> 18:38.880
the daytime and he coughed or sneezed and the couple people at the bar her ting ting ting

18:38.880 --> 18:44.400
ting ting ting ting and his eyeball had shot across the bar and then landed on the bar mat

18:44.400 --> 18:48.960
like down on the ground there which is even grosser possibly than the carpet that was still there at

18:48.960 --> 18:52.960
the time and the bartender and he was like looking around for it and he doesn't know where it sat

18:52.960 --> 18:57.200
and the bartender picked it up washed it off and gave it to him and he went put it right back in

18:58.240 --> 19:05.920
that's a good bar yeah that's my kind of shit it's a bar so vile that hipsters will never take

19:05.920 --> 19:11.760
it over yeah the gauntlet's been thrown down and one of the few bars that boast a women's room

19:11.760 --> 19:17.600
it smells worse than a men's room i've only been in the women's room once but that men's room holy

19:17.600 --> 19:24.000
tamale yeah there's bugs in there that don't exist outside of the men's room of the driver yeah do

19:24.000 --> 19:27.360
you know there's a weird theory about that like there's bugs that fly in your face when you're

19:27.360 --> 19:32.400
standing at the urinal and he he thinks he thinks that the reason they're there is because of the

19:32.400 --> 19:37.040
pee that is on the wall because you can never hit the urinal because there's bugs in your face

19:37.040 --> 19:43.040
so he thinks it's a whole biosphere that the it's like an amazing darwinian evolution that

19:43.040 --> 19:47.840
that that like these bugs have evolved like no they're i mean they don't know but the same way

19:47.840 --> 19:52.160
like there's birds that drop walnuts into traffic so that the the cars crack the walnuts and then

19:52.160 --> 19:57.760
they eat the nut meat these these these bugs they they literally live for one day so like like

19:57.760 --> 20:02.080
like last 30 years of the drawing room people peeing has been like a millennia to them yeah

20:02.080 --> 20:06.880
so you you bet you bet it's a possibility there used to be doors in there but but the bar opens

20:06.880 --> 20:11.120
at 6am and it boasts cocktail lounge open at 6am and so i think a lot of druggies were going in

20:11.120 --> 20:15.360
there and so the doors are now off there so you can't go in there and do drugs uh but now it's

20:15.360 --> 20:19.760
turning this weird kind of like men's shower like the whole thing has been designed so when people

20:19.760 --> 20:24.240
puke or pee all over the place because they will clean the bathroom there it'll be spick and span

20:24.240 --> 20:31.120
and 10 seconds later there is a three foot like like like a three point line of piss around the

20:31.120 --> 20:35.040
thing like you can't get close to it and then it then it's just receding because now no one

20:35.040 --> 20:38.960
wants to step on the pee right now people are progressively peeing farther away when things

20:38.960 --> 20:43.040
they can hang from the rafters and be the cleanest monkey to get out of the drawing room bathroom

20:43.040 --> 20:48.160
so then it's just like it's it's just this uh this exponential piss cycle that goes on

20:48.160 --> 20:51.920
there so they designed the whole thing now where you they have a thing they hook up which is like

20:51.920 --> 20:55.840
a car wash where they just go in and steam the whole thing down yeah and they just rinse the

20:55.840 --> 21:00.400
whole thing down and then it's you know shiny and new and then 10 seconds later because the more

21:00.400 --> 21:05.200
they do that it's the broken window theory in new york you know if the pre-guliani whole thing was

21:05.200 --> 21:09.280
the idea of the the neighborhoods have a tipping point if you're walking down the streets covered

21:09.280 --> 21:12.800
with garbage and all the windows are broken like you'll break a window you don't give a shit if

21:12.800 --> 21:16.960
you walked on a pristine street there's that sort of i think it's i don't think it's that that gallant

21:16.960 --> 21:20.640
of us i think we're just afraid to be the first person i think you know just i think it's just

21:20.640 --> 21:25.760
sort of like cowardice and like and you can see it in european bathrooms i swear i went to europe

21:25.760 --> 21:29.840
for the first time a couple years ago and i was just marveling i was like i went to dive bars the

21:29.840 --> 21:35.200
bathrooms are still a little cleaner than the dive bars in america and i and my my girlfriend at the

21:35.200 --> 21:43.680
time said that her her theory was that americans are more germaphobic too so we tend to try to

21:43.680 --> 21:48.640
take shits and peas without touching anything and we end up making everything worse and the

21:48.640 --> 21:53.520
cycle continues there's europeans are like hey it's my butt it's your butt you know i don't know

21:53.520 --> 22:00.640
what i'm we're both from chanselvania uh there were uh thoughts to the same piece of plastic

22:01.280 --> 22:05.760

22:05.760 --> 22:11.200
drawing room there were what covered in shit paper towels oh yeah well i mean like coming out of

24:08.880 --> 24:12.160

24:16.800 --> 24:20.560
jeff you won't watch the movie halloween will you no that movie fucked my shit up man the

24:20.560 --> 24:26.560
original halloween jeff i had a fucking babysitter when did that movie come out 77 8 79 okay so i was

24:26.560 --> 24:33.760
born in 73 i was what six ish uh i had a babysitter megan osullivan uh megan if you're out there

24:33.760 --> 24:38.640
go fuck yourself because she took me because i saw jaws on her watch and i couldn't go into a pool

24:38.640 --> 24:48.080
for years and then i saw you know what they say fear is the best pacifier no you're doing a real

24:48.080 --> 24:58.960
dialect class tonight please continuing story comrade oh thank you uh i remember being i don't

24:58.960 --> 25:03.600
know how movies worked back then but you it wasn't like you it was his previous but somehow we had

25:03.600 --> 25:09.040
halloween at our house and i couldn't have been more than six or seven years old and we watched

25:09.040 --> 25:13.200
that and that movie really screwed me up and i had like is the thing about uh what's his name

25:13.200 --> 25:17.600
michael meyers yeah the thing about him is he's supernatural because as soon as you look away

25:17.600 --> 25:22.240
he's there you know he's he moves like a ghost he just happened like like you turn your head

25:22.240 --> 25:26.960
and he sits up on the couch and it's scary like he's just he's got that ghostly inside out william

25:26.960 --> 25:32.960
shatner mask and it's uh it's freaky and and i was just too young to watch it i don't think it

25:32.960 --> 25:37.280
would have scared me if i watched it when i was 15 because no other movies scare me at all when i

25:37.280 --> 25:40.640
was 18 years old my friends were having a party and they're like we're gonna watch scary movies i'm

25:40.640 --> 25:43.840
like what are you watching they go we're gonna watch halloween i'm like you know what i'm 18

25:43.840 --> 25:50.160
years old i'm an adult and then college i'm gonna i'm gonna watch this shit and fucking three more

25:50.160 --> 25:54.960
months of looking over both shoulders like uh turn turn the light off when you when you go to bed

25:54.960 --> 25:59.200
and then turn it back on again and turn it off and turn it on again they go maybe maybe maybe

25:59.200 --> 26:04.480
dive into the bed like for real i was a grown man and i won't watch it and even like when it's on

26:04.480 --> 26:08.560
like those commercials for it and i see that mask it's like i just like it just represents me looking

26:08.560 --> 26:12.080
over my shoulder like i was too young for that i don't think there's anything that scares me like

26:12.080 --> 26:16.800
that i just don't like those modern horror movies modern like now it's probably like 20 years old

26:16.800 --> 26:24.560
but like event horizon is a perfect example in one of these you're laughing because it's my i said

26:24.560 --> 26:30.880
modern when i was talking about event horizon um the i rented it at blockbuster that that's new

26:32.320 --> 26:36.960
what is event horizon about i've never heard it it's about a spaceship that can go faster than the

26:36.960 --> 26:41.840
speed of light but it turns out when you go faster than the speed of light you go through hell uh

26:42.720 --> 26:47.440
because because time stops or whatever hell being defined as whatever ookey bookey like

26:47.440 --> 26:52.320
like whatever uh thing you you know when you're greatest fears or regrets or dead wives or so

26:52.320 --> 26:56.400
everybody aboard the ship of course has a lost a popsicle once and then they see a popsicle

26:57.360 --> 27:03.280
it's a dumb movie but this is the thing about about modern horror as opposed to john carpenter's

27:03.280 --> 27:11.440
stuff um uh that was pop the champagne this is john carpenter just fucking the masters of horror

27:11.440 --> 27:17.760
in the back will never be dethroned boys john carpenter goes into every location with some

27:17.760 --> 27:22.160
champagne in case someone mentioned it just in case i he's he's he's been he's been he's wasted

27:22.160 --> 27:28.560
six hours this week watching uh joneray stand up just waiting that champagne's so hot and flat

27:28.560 --> 27:33.600
it's not even worth drinking right because that's superboli it's just holding it all time this patent

27:33.600 --> 27:39.120
as well guy goes on forever well just say something about me john carpenter let me pop this

27:39.120 --> 27:46.880
fucker it's it's it's it's it's from 1948 um the uh the event horizon these these these new horror

27:46.880 --> 27:54.960
movies as i call them uh the thing is that they go like like you know the guy i'll be looking the

27:54.960 --> 27:59.600
the mirror in his medicine chest he's brushing his teeth and then he'll he'll close the medicine

27:59.600 --> 28:03.920
chest door oh and you're expecting to see a thing no you don't see a thing and he's like

28:03.920 --> 28:10.000
looking in the mirror and then it just hard cuts to like a a you know different lighting of a woman

28:10.000 --> 28:16.400
with blood streaming down her face and it just goes it just it just it's not that's not fear

28:16.400 --> 28:22.080
that's startling yeah that's just that's just that's just a thumbtack on your on your chair it

28:22.080 --> 28:27.040
doesn't it doesn't count it doesn't i don't like that i don't like being startled in a movie you

28:27.040 --> 28:30.960
could do that you could that doesn't take any craftsmanship how old are you when you first saw

28:30.960 --> 28:40.560
a labyrinth erin oh um uh thanks for cheering for age uh i i was six seven did it scare you

28:40.560 --> 28:44.400
um the first scene and the better you see it seems pretty scary for kids in the beginning

28:44.400 --> 28:52.720
yeah i noticed that as the writer of monster house i have a keen eye for this stuff i wrote a movie that

28:54.880 --> 28:58.720
every time i'm in this every time my friend mentions his own movies i pop champagne

29:01.840 --> 29:07.280
kids get scared pretty easily little kids even even in even in this post horse dick internet world

29:07.280 --> 29:15.920
of of of they've seen everything little little kids still get scared phd um post horse dick after

29:15.920 --> 29:21.120
labrith nothing was post dick because it's just bulge and he's bouncing he's bouncing an infant

29:21.120 --> 29:27.120
on a just a rigid con piece the entire time it's really it's really horny he's he's he's older than

29:27.120 --> 29:31.280
i am in that movie right how old is bowie in that movie he's gotta be older than 39 right i don't know

29:31.280 --> 29:37.360
but but and he's coming on to it's like what 15 year old 14 she's she's she's 14 but but he's

29:37.360 --> 29:46.560
her fantasy and he's her fantasy yes also he's i watched the uh behind the scenes documentary

29:46.560 --> 29:56.160
again today and uh it's it's uh monday tomorrow's vitamin day i'm gonna watch vitamins all day

29:56.160 --> 30:03.280
tomorrow um so bowie's talking about the goblin king and he he says uh well he he doesn't choose

30:04.000 --> 30:08.400
to to have her there he's reluctant but then he's forced into this way like he his explanation

30:08.400 --> 30:12.960
was nothing that i think anyone has ever thought like he was he sat down with jim henson jim henson's

30:12.960 --> 30:19.040
like yeah fine that's that's your explanation that the goblin king uh doesn't want to be the

30:19.040 --> 30:25.520
goblin king but because he's there he may as well do a good job and um so that's you know

30:25.520 --> 30:29.680
yeah jennifer connelly was to me that the goblin king spends most of his time hanging out in a

30:29.680 --> 30:35.600
dungeon with 50 asshole puppets yeah yeah well now you know why because half of the movie was

30:35.600 --> 30:43.600
written by a fucking guitarist uh for real i'm just saying you want a good story don't go to

30:43.600 --> 30:48.240
you know david bowie well david bowie didn't write the story charry jones charry jones wrote the

30:48.240 --> 30:53.120
movie he came up with the character like like motivation that's the thing about the movie

30:53.120 --> 30:58.160
that doesn't make any sense to me there's no stakes we call them you know as we say it uh at

30:58.160 --> 31:04.240
denny's end in writing there's you need stakes back to time that is the biggest is the biggest

31:04.880 --> 31:09.600
labyrinth fan out here who other than erin so someone think that they're a bigger labyrinth fan

31:09.600 --> 31:19.360
than erin john carpenter it's bj oh my god it's john carpenter come on up here john carpenter

31:19.360 --> 31:26.320
yeah we got john carpenter's in the house uh bj wow you're looking very front a surprise special

31:26.320 --> 31:30.880
no it's john carpenter wait i don't know what's really really what are we talking about labyrinth

31:30.880 --> 31:40.640
you're gonna stick up your labyrinth yeah one humans and puppets together but real not like the

31:40.640 --> 31:51.120
muppets wait no no no exactly like the muppets it's exactly like the muppets they're both as real

31:51.120 --> 32:00.400
as each other no no the muppets are actors so two you've got oh i see oh the muppets are playing

32:00.400 --> 32:06.960
actors it's not like the larry sanders show they're not well it kind of is it's kind of behind the

32:06.960 --> 32:13.520
scenes that is uh john carpenter do you mean uh there are there are little people that are playing

32:13.520 --> 32:19.040
the puppets is that what you mean like it's different and that's nope no no no i'm saying

32:19.040 --> 32:28.480
uh fuzzy bear right um kermit miss piggy animals in a band so he's a musician but they're they're

32:28.480 --> 32:34.720
actors they're not oh they're actually on the muppet show yeah so like when you see them like oh

32:34.720 --> 32:42.800
we gotta get to new york or whatever it's like yeah because you're actors oh you're saying that

32:42.800 --> 32:48.240
it isn't every man which you obviously are you're you find it less relatable to watch a show biz

32:48.240 --> 32:54.960
show there's more very similar to it when the puppets are goblins that when puppets are actors

32:54.960 --> 33:02.320
that's crazy in the uh in the behind the scenes documentary uh jim henson is talking about why

33:02.320 --> 33:07.440
he wanted to make the movie anyway and him and terry jones say like well like we just wanted

33:07.440 --> 33:14.160
to make a movie again with puppets and people that's like dirt crystal but fun and goblins maybe

33:14.160 --> 33:19.200
like it was such a loose idea and so great but then it became such a great movie i was sitting

33:19.200 --> 33:24.480
out at the the pikey the bar a couple blocks up the uh the street as uh here on the sunset

33:24.480 --> 33:28.960
boulevard as i do every Harmontown and uh i was sitting there by myself at the bar

33:28.960 --> 33:33.520
there's a little out of place on a monday uh it's not nothing because two days before halloween

33:33.520 --> 33:39.440
it's not a weekend nobody else was in costume i mean if i had gone to the rainbow room i would

33:39.440 --> 33:43.360
i would have been just every other guy in there yeah well some chick dressed as a cat would have

33:43.360 --> 33:47.440
given you a hand job you would have been fine yeah everybody would have been oh man but also it's

33:47.440 --> 33:50.560
it's halloween it's near halloween people can dig it and no one's given me any business but

33:50.560 --> 33:55.280
there's one guy sitting next to me like he's like two stools down and uh and he's like yeah

33:55.280 --> 34:00.960
i fucking hate hollywood you know i live downtown you know downtown i hollywood's kind of anathema

34:00.960 --> 34:04.320
to me i don't go to hollywood hollywood's kind of bullshit i mean i'm here right now but i'm

34:04.320 --> 34:08.400

you know and he looks over at me he goes huh yeah uh i love you in dark crystal man so anyway

34:16.000 --> 34:20.400
i don't know where to begin analyzing that like he my indignation was more righteous than

34:20.400 --> 34:26.160
any other time in my life he thought you were just hanging out at the at the pikey dress no i

34:26.160 --> 34:30.240
think he's just a dishback who thinks he didn't know at all and he asked right he was just on a

34:30.240 --> 34:34.960
flow he has to put his fingerprint on everything around him he just moved downtown so he's like

34:34.960 --> 34:39.440
holy shit oh everything also i ordered i'll have a i'll have a sam smith lager and a friend at bronco

34:40.480 --> 34:44.640

boots i'm nine feet tall in this costume and he says he was a little shrimpy fucker and he was

35:00.000 --> 35:03.920
just trying he was just trying to affect everybody in the goddamn bar which is the worst because it

35:03.920 --> 35:08.160
was he's just he just broke up with his girlfriend and he re-ikeered the missing stuff from his in

35:08.160 --> 35:13.520
his part in his loft well he filled in all her missing spots he was sitting in a bar in hollywood

35:13.520 --> 35:17.520
trying to talk about how uncool hollywood is which is a little look there's a case for the hollywood

35:17.520 --> 35:21.520
kind of blows in lots of ways but there's also good things about hollywood for instance

35:21.520 --> 35:26.480
Harmontown for one uh that's that's in hollywood and the nerdest time being that's in hollywood

35:26.480 --> 35:30.800
and then until such time as it can get emancipated yeah absolutely but this guy was just like every

35:30.800 --> 35:36.240
time anybody ordered a drink he had to like weigh in on it and uh he took a lot longer two olives

35:36.240 --> 35:41.360

35:49.360 --> 35:54.080
about i've heard about i don't like it uh i'm above that but then he uh he waited way longer to weigh

35:54.080 --> 35:58.960
in on me because i think he had to wait a half hour to hear me finally order a drink and to hear

35:58.960 --> 36:05.520
that i wasn't gonna sound like david bowie because i was like oh don't be cruel to me i'll be cruel

37:15.120 --> 37:21.600
be very cool something like that close it kind of ties like he's written written by a uh like

37:21.600 --> 37:28.320
like like like instructions for a wee game as a sort of thing he just sort of says things the way

37:28.320 --> 37:36.240
they are a kind of a long-winded way yeah most Sarah you didn't know that imagination had things in

37:36.240 --> 37:41.680
store for you he doesn't really say anything it's like most of the dialogue is her muttering to

37:41.680 --> 37:48.080
herself because she's walking around half alone in a labyrinth it's not fair it's not fair it's so

37:48.080 --> 37:55.120
hard to get to this labyrinth ah you know what i should do i should stop walking to the labyrinth

37:55.120 --> 37:59.440
the way i'm walking to the labyrinth well if you do that then you won't know which way you're going

38:01.120 --> 38:07.840

38:29.200 --> 38:41.040
entire time no oh well then i choose to not listen to you no but that's not your choice to make i'm

38:41.040 --> 38:48.560
afraid i'm going to turn the clock into a calculator and subtract two no you can't do that okay i want

38:48.560 --> 38:54.560
to be a good babysitter okay but didn't the first uh the opening act of this movie start with you

38:54.560 --> 39:01.120
hating babysitting but i don't mean it anymore i changed my mind this is a realm where nothing

39:01.120 --> 39:07.760
means anything set up i like i like that you don't mean anything wait what no no stop no no stop

39:07.760 --> 39:15.040

39:21.840 --> 39:27.040
muppets in my room whenever the fuck including the ones that were tried to rip my fucking head off

39:28.560 --> 39:32.640
technically speaking and the ones who tried to impale me with pikes

39:32.640 --> 39:39.360
i was so flattered my heart was so warmed when you guys wanted to dress up like

39:40.080 --> 39:46.320
we wanted to talk it's an intervention erin we all dressed as jareth tonight because we knew it was

39:46.320 --> 39:52.720
the only way you'd come this movie has story problems it's no it's no monster house we couldn't

39:52.720 --> 39:56.240
i mean where is the revelation that the whole thing is because a fat lady died

39:56.240 --> 40:02.000
where where's the point in the story that joseph camel calls for where after they get

40:02.000 --> 40:07.120
barfed up by the monster and they have tea for a fucking hour i haven't seen it i'm grinding

40:07.120 --> 40:12.480
some axes about a movie no one's seen yeah it's not the best movie but the thing is i like it i

40:12.480 --> 40:16.800
like watching it however it's i can't get through the motherfucker i can't make it to i can't i

40:16.800 --> 40:32.000

40:54.720 --> 41:13.360
show your your car will be spray painted yoko well i enjoy time bandits but to me time bandits is

41:13.360 --> 41:19.520
it's and it's written by another member of montipython it's the same thing or the same weird

41:19.520 --> 41:26.080
themes it's the same like anti-parent fantasy no i get a strange jumble and you love that movie

41:26.080 --> 41:30.560
i it takes more than the theme to make a movie i'm not i'm not all i'm saying is that labyrinth

41:30.560 --> 41:34.240
isn't citizen kane i will say the same about time bandits and i will say the same thing about

41:34.240 --> 41:38.000
goonies i think that back to the future has reasonably tight structure a lot of our favorite

41:38.000 --> 41:43.040
movies don't i i like a lot of what we love about movies they're the actors and their performances

41:43.040 --> 41:47.600
and and especially like the emotional i'll use the word gestalt not knowing what it means

41:47.600 --> 41:53.840
uh that that that kind of like especially when we're kids like we don't even watch movies the

41:53.840 --> 41:58.640
same way we don't experience a story like like really the same way we kind of like you know

41:58.640 --> 42:03.040
we we just sort of see images and kind of feel feelings and well and i i mean name another

42:03.040 --> 42:10.320

42:44.320 --> 42:50.320
acted in other movies but in this movie he is a rock star he wrote all the songs i can't think of

42:50.320 --> 42:55.600

42:55.600 --> 43:02.640

aggressively shut down wendy or lisa in your face well wendy can go fuck herself like uh yeah um

43:30.560 --> 43:40.640

43:40.640 --> 43:47.920
that were you like i mean he he taught me how to to sex i don't know are we like totally like that

44:35.520 --> 44:41.440
there's obviously there's a there's a contention raging but it's a people you know in america we

44:41.440 --> 44:45.920
have a problem i think i think this is the infantilization of america we've been we've been

44:45.920 --> 44:50.720
raised through countless generations now to think that this is how we express our personalities

44:50.720 --> 44:55.760
and that we're either right or wrong like that we have favorite movies and movies are good or bad

44:55.760 --> 45:00.800
and we argue about them you can see that reflected in the politics too it's like we're we're being

45:00.800 --> 45:07.440

chimps i don't know if i ever talked about that and they did it they showed how chimps don't they

47:18.480 --> 47:22.560
don't they don't really have cooperation in their spirit i mean they do for problem solving but only

47:22.560 --> 47:26.880
if the alpha male gets to eat and they put a board and they wear these these ropes and then the alpha

47:26.880 --> 47:30.320
male comes in and he pulls one side of the board and he notices the rope will go all the way through

47:30.320 --> 47:34.800
the other side of the board so he he'll unlock the fence that contains the beta males and they'll

47:34.800 --> 47:39.040
come in and help them pull the board together and and then they all get to share the food but if

47:39.040 --> 47:44.880
they only put food on on in the middle of the board the alpha male eat it all and then after that

47:44.880 --> 47:48.800
the beta male when the alpha male opens the door and says hey come on help me move the food the

47:48.800 --> 47:55.120
baby male go fuck you not helping you're a dick like you're a you're a chimp i'm a chimp fuck you

half of you are animators sometimes sometimes you're working in that department

49:57.280 --> 50:02.160
in human clothes we have to draw uh is that your stumbling block is the human clothes on the animals

50:02.160 --> 50:11.840

50:12.640 --> 50:20.000
