Harmontown.\n\n00:15.000 --> 00:17.000\nYou know who he is.\n\n00:17.000 --> 00:19.000\nYou know how he gets down.\n\n00:19.000 --> 00:21.000\nDamn Harmon.\n\n00:21.000 --> 00:28.000\nBeats, beats, rap, rapping beats, beating to the rap, the rap that can't be beat.\n\n00:28.000 --> 00:34.000\nDan Harmon on the microphone, slipping your mama's, my Harmon bone.\n\n00:34.000 --> 00:38.000\nIt's a tiny penis, but it gets the job done.\n\n00:38.000 --> 00:40.000\nIt's not the way you use it.\n\n00:40.000 --> 00:43.000\nIt's whether you have fun and whether she does too.\n\n00:43.000 --> 00:47.000\nAnd if you have her consent and whether you do it in a sleeping bag or tent.\n\n00:47.000 --> 00:51.000\nI took your mama camping up at Algonquin Falls.\n\n00:51.000 --> 00:54.000\nIt's a place outside of shopping malls.\n\n00:54.000 --> 00:58.000\nZombies attacked and we took refuge in the building.\n\n00:58.000 --> 01:02.000\nI fucked your mama so hard, I was gilding her pussy.\n\n01:02.000 --> 01:04.000\nMy penis is gold.\n\n01:04.000 --> 01:06.000\nIt plates your pussy.\n\n01:06.000 --> 01:11.000\nAs I'm told, it's a chemical process called electroplating.\n\n01:11.000 --> 01:12.000\nI fucked it.\n\n01:12.000 --> 01:16.000\nFuck your mama when I'm masturbating.\n\n01:16.000 --> 01:20.000\nYo, yo, yo.\n\n01:20.000 --> 01:25.000\n2006, motherfuckers.\n\n01:25.000 --> 01:27.000\nYeah.\n\n01:27.000 --> 01:30.000\nI saw a pumpkin once.\n\n01:30.000 --> 01:34.000\nI saw a paper hat on a dunce, a paper cone.\n\n01:34.000 --> 01:37.000\nYou wear it like a hat.\n\n01:37.000 --> 01:39.000\nYou punish kids like that.\n\n01:39.000 --> 01:44.000\nYou make them wear a cone made out of paper.\n\n01:44.000 --> 01:49.000\nIt's like Don Draper did in 1961.\n\n01:49.000 --> 01:52.000\nFuck your mama so hard.\n\n01:52.000 --> 01:54.000\nI made her come.\n\n01:54.000 --> 01:57.000\nShe came all night.\n\n01:57.000 --> 02:04.000\nShe saw the light, the coming light, the orgasm light, the Christian light.\n\n02:04.000 --> 02:09.000\nI gave her what's right, put her on the cross, sucked on her feet,\n\n02:09.000 --> 02:17.000\npoked her with a spear just to make sure she was dead.\n\n02:17.000 --> 02:19.000\nThat's fucked up.\n\n02:19.000 --> 02:21.000\nAfter three days, she woke up.\n\n02:21.000 --> 02:22.000\nShe came back out.\n\n02:22.000 --> 02:24.000\nShe said, give me more dick because what's up?\n\n02:24.000 --> 02:28.000\nI took her down to the park at dark.\n\n02:28.000 --> 02:32.000\nFucked her until it was no longer dark.\n\n02:32.000 --> 02:36.000\nThe sun come up on me fucking your mom.\n\n02:36.000 --> 02:39.000\nShe took a pom-pom.\n\n02:39.000 --> 02:41.000\nShe did a splits in the air.\n\n02:41.000 --> 02:46.000\nShe said, rah-rah, hooray chair.\n\n02:46.000 --> 02:48.000\nAnd I said, table.\n\n02:48.000 --> 02:50.000\nShe said, furniture.\n\n02:50.000 --> 02:53.000\nI said, table.\n\n02:53.000 --> 02:55.000\nWe were free associating.\n\n02:55.000 --> 02:57.000\nFucked your mama so hard.\n\n02:57.000 --> 03:02.000\nI was electroplating her with the aforementioned system.\n\n03:02.000 --> 03:04.000\nI fucked your mama.\n\n03:04.000 --> 03:08.000\nBut listen, she liked it.\n\n03:08.000 --> 03:12.000\nAnd afterwards, we went biking.\n\n03:12.000 --> 03:15.000\nCardiovascular.\n\n03:15.000 --> 03:18.000\nIt was spectacular.\n\n03:18.000 --> 03:21.000\nRaise your heart rate.\n\n03:21.000 --> 03:23.000\nDon't even masturbate.\n\n03:23.000 --> 03:25.000\nNo FAP, F-A-P.\n\n03:25.000 --> 03:27.000\nNo, not for me.\n\n03:27.000 --> 03:31.000\nFucking your mama's the only activity I want to be doing.\n\n03:31.000 --> 03:34.000\nComing inside, it's an organic process.\n\n03:34.000 --> 03:36.000\nMakes your orgasm more wide.\n\n03:36.000 --> 03:40.000\nFulfilling the bandwidth of your pleasure.\n\n03:40.000 --> 03:43.000\nFucked your mama at my leisure.\n\n03:43.000 --> 03:45.000\nIt's a job, though.\n\n03:45.000 --> 03:46.000\nI get it done.\n\n03:46.000 --> 03:48.000\nLike Larry Cable Guy.\n\n03:48.000 --> 03:50.000\nI'm number one.\n\n03:50.000 --> 03:52.000\nYipp-yipp-yipp-yipp.\n\n03:52.000 --> 03:54.000\nYipp-yipp-yipp-yipp.\n\n03:54.000 --> 03:56.000\nYipp-yipp-yipp-yipp.\n\n03:56.000 --> 03:57.000\nHarmontown.\n\n03:57.000 --> 03:59.000\nIt's the show that's beginning.\n\n03:59.000 --> 04:01.000\nHarmontown is not the show that's losing.\n\n04:01.000 --> 04:02.000\nIt's the show that's winning.\n\n04:02.000 --> 04:05.000\nThere's no audience allowed in the warehouse.\n\n04:05.000 --> 04:09.000\nBecause the man came down and shut it down.\n\n04:09.000 --> 04:12.000\nThousand Island dressing.\n\n04:12.000 --> 04:14.000\nYo.\n\n04:14.000 --> 04:17.000\nDeborah Messing.\n\n04:17.000 --> 04:19.000\nDeborah Messing.\n\n04:19.000 --> 04:20.000\nYo.\n\n04:20.000 --> 04:22.000\nDeborah Messing.\n\n04:22.000 --> 04:25.000\nDeborah Messing isn't messing around.\n\n04:25.000 --> 04:28.000\nHarmontown is about to go down.\n\n04:28.000 --> 04:31.000\nAnd then it comes up.\n\n04:31.000 --> 04:34.000\nAll right.\n\n04:34.000 --> 04:36.000\nShout out to Deborah Messing.\n\n04:36.000 --> 04:41.000\nYeah, thank you, Deborah Messing, for having that name.\n\n04:41.000 --> 04:43.000\nAll right.\n\n04:43.000 --> 04:45.000\nWell, yeah, I thought, I thought if we started with a wrap,\n\n04:45.000 --> 04:47.000\nthat maybe the energy would be up more.\n\n04:47.000 --> 04:48.000\nI forgot.\n\n04:48.000 --> 04:50.000\nYeah, I forgot about this.\n\n04:50.000 --> 04:52.000\nI feel like people at home are definitely bopping their heads.\n\n04:52.000 --> 04:54.000\nYeah.\n\n04:54.000 --> 04:59.000\nWell, yeah, so I was shaving.\n\n04:59.000 --> 05:00.000\nI was trimming.\n\n05:00.000 --> 05:03.000\nI was trying to trim my beard to go to this thing.\n\n05:03.000 --> 05:10.000\nI had to do this Rosemarie documentary Q&A with Dick Van Dyke.\n\n05:10.000 --> 05:13.000\nI was like, I'm going to be sitting next to Dick Van Dyke.\n\n05:13.000 --> 05:16.000\nHe's a very handsome guy.\n\n05:16.000 --> 05:17.000\nRespect.\n\n05:17.000 --> 05:18.000\nYeah.\n\n05:18.000 --> 05:19.000\nSo I tried to trim a little bit.\n\n05:19.000 --> 05:20.000\nAnd then I nicked.\n\n05:20.000 --> 05:23.000\nAnd I disconnected right where the mustache meets the beard.\n\n05:23.000 --> 05:26.000\nAnd I was like, oh, I better do that on the other side.\n\n05:26.000 --> 05:31.000\nI look like a ventriloquist dummy or like an Amish Japanese\n\n05:31.000 --> 05:37.000\nassassin, an Amish ninja fusion.\n\n05:37.000 --> 05:40.000\nI don't know what it looked really distinct.\n\n05:40.000 --> 05:41.000\nIt looked really specific.\n\n05:41.000 --> 05:43.000\nAnd it was going to distract me all night.\n\n05:43.000 --> 05:45.000\nSo then I just shaved the whole beard.\n\n05:45.000 --> 05:47.000\nRather than look like a shitty auctioneer.\n\n05:47.000 --> 05:48.000\nYeah.\n\n05:48.000 --> 05:50.000\nSo now I look great.\n\n05:50.000 --> 05:51.000\nHow do you feel, though?\n\n05:51.000 --> 05:53.000\nBecause you look younger.\n\n05:53.000 --> 05:55.000\nYeah, but what's the point of being younger\n\n05:55.000 --> 05:58.000\nif you're a young tub of shit?\n\n05:58.000 --> 06:06.000\nYou look like a young fucking sad pimply seal.\n\n06:06.000 --> 06:11.000\nBut not a sad pimply seal a day over five,\n\n06:11.000 --> 06:14.000\nwhich is 50 in seal years.\n\n06:14.000 --> 06:16.000\nHow was it?\n\n06:16.000 --> 06:17.000\nIt was interesting.\n\n06:17.000 --> 06:18.000\nI really like that documentary.\n\n06:18.000 --> 06:20.000\nI really recommend it a lot.\n\n06:20.000 --> 06:23.000\nIt has the unintended effect of making you kind of comfortable\n\n06:23.000 --> 06:25.000\nwith mortality.\n\n06:25.000 --> 06:29.000\nRose Marie is 95 years old, 94.\n\n06:29.000 --> 06:34.000\nShe's almost literally born entertaining.\n\n06:34.000 --> 06:36.000\nShe's like four years old, and she's like singing.\n\n06:36.000 --> 06:39.000\nAnd then she's 94 at the end of the documentary.\n\n06:39.000 --> 06:43.000\nAnd she's saying, like, why am I left?\n\n06:43.000 --> 06:45.000\nDoes anybody have a work for me?\n\n06:45.000 --> 06:47.000\nI can come in my wheelchair.\n\n06:47.000 --> 06:51.000\nAnd she's just like, anybody want me to do something?\n\n06:51.000 --> 06:52.000\nI'll do something.\n\n06:52.000 --> 06:55.000\nAnd I was like, yeah, there's that.\n\n06:55.000 --> 06:58.000\nOr then there's the Jim Carrey method.\n\n06:58.000 --> 07:00.000\nI watched that documentary where Jim Carrey talks\n\n07:00.000 --> 07:02.000\nabout being Andy Kaufman.\n\n07:02.000 --> 07:06.000\nAnd his whole thing is like, none of this matters.\n\n07:06.000 --> 07:10.000\nAnd he's like, oh, that's not a coffee cup.\n\n07:10.000 --> 07:13.000\nI'm not about to drink out of it.\n\n07:13.000 --> 07:14.000\nNow I did.\n\n07:14.000 --> 07:18.000\nAnd he had to, if you're Jim Carrey, you probably have to,\n\n07:18.000 --> 07:20.000\nyou can't just be like, I'll do anything.\n\n07:20.000 --> 07:22.000\nSo then you have to be like, OK, how\n\n07:22.000 --> 07:24.000\ndo I feel about having a trillion dollars?\n\n07:24.000 --> 07:25.000\nYeah.\n\n07:25.000 --> 07:26.000\nYeah.\n\n07:26.000 --> 07:28.000\nAnd being broke, he started out so poor.\n\n07:28.000 --> 07:29.000\nYeah.\n\n07:29.000 --> 07:34.000\nAnd Canadian, which is like, yeah.\n\n07:34.000 --> 07:38.000\nThat's like the poverty of nationalities.\n\n07:38.000 --> 07:42.000\nSo even a rich Canadian is like a fucking,\n\n07:42.000 --> 07:43.000\nit's already starting at zero.\n\n07:47.000 --> 07:51.000\nI'd apologize, but Canadians don't care.\n\n07:51.000 --> 07:52.000\nYeah, they're too nice.\n\n07:52.000 --> 07:53.000\nYeah.\n\n07:53.000 --> 07:54.000\nThey're apologizing to me.\n\n07:54.000 --> 07:58.000\nYeah, they just happen to be shouted out at this point.\n\n07:58.000 --> 08:01.000\nThey're tweeting, I'm sorry.\n\n08:01.000 --> 08:03.000\nYou call this piece of shit right now.\n\n08:06.000 --> 08:09.000\nSo you were inside a lot, I take it, when you weren't going out,\n\n08:09.000 --> 08:11.000\nbecause that means you watched a lot of documentaries.\n\n08:11.000 --> 08:12.000\nYeah.\n\n08:12.000 --> 08:16.000\nI mean, do you go outside a lot?\n\n08:16.000 --> 08:17.000\nI go outside a lot.\n\n08:17.000 --> 08:18.000\nYou do?\n\n08:18.000 --> 08:18.000\nYeah.\n\n08:18.000 --> 08:20.000\nYeah, that's where the people are.\n\n08:20.000 --> 08:21.000\nYeah.\n\n08:21.000 --> 08:24.000\nI like to watch the people.\n\n08:24.000 --> 08:26.000\nHow can you keep an eye on all of them?\n\n08:26.000 --> 08:28.000\nYou know that one of them is going to kill you, right?\n\n08:28.000 --> 08:29.000\nYeah.\n\n08:29.000 --> 08:31.000\nWell, I keep an eye on that one, especially.\n\n08:31.000 --> 08:33.000\nThe only way to guarantee you don't die by person\n\n08:33.000 --> 08:36.000\nis to stay away from all of them,\n\n08:36.000 --> 08:39.000\nand that they are the number one killer of people right now.\n\n08:39.000 --> 08:40.000\nI mean, I'm just trying.\n\n08:40.000 --> 08:43.000\nThere's a lot of places that I've seen things go down,\n\n08:43.000 --> 08:45.000\nso I know not to go to certain concerts in certain places.\n\n08:45.000 --> 08:48.000\nHow would you have known to avoid the,\n\n08:48.000 --> 08:52.000\nI think you would have considered the Don McLean,\n\n08:52.000 --> 08:54.000\nwhat was that guy's name?\n\n08:54.000 --> 08:57.000\nI'm not headed to like an Eagles reunion.\n\n08:57.000 --> 08:59.000\nI'm not going to any sort of like.\n\n08:59.000 --> 09:01.000\nYou can't tell what concert's going to get.\n\n09:01.000 --> 09:02.000\nI can.\n\n09:02.000 --> 09:03.000\nGoing to get blowed up.\n\n09:03.000 --> 09:04.000\nWhat do you mean?\n\n09:04.000 --> 09:05.000\nYou can't tell?\n\n09:05.000 --> 09:06.000\nAre you magical?\n\n09:06.000 --> 09:07.000\nAre you like a CW hero?\n\n09:07.000 --> 09:11.000\nAre you, do you have a, are you the mentalist?\n\n09:11.000 --> 09:13.000\nThe mentalist when it comes to concerts.\n\n09:13.000 --> 09:15.000\nOr are you saying you have a system?\n\n09:15.000 --> 09:16.000\nI have a system.\n\n09:16.000 --> 09:18.000\nI live right beneath the Greek.\n\n09:18.000 --> 09:21.000\nI've lived there for like 15 years, as you do as well.\n\n09:21.000 --> 09:24.000\nAnd you sort of get an idea of who's at the concert and what\n\n09:24.000 --> 09:27.000\nthe show is going to be by like who's marching up the hill.\n\n09:27.000 --> 09:28.000\nSo yeah.\n\n09:28.000 --> 09:31.000\nIs there, is there a concert you'd buy a ticket to?\n\n09:31.000 --> 09:33.000\nAnd then as you were walking up to the Greek theater,\n\n09:33.000 --> 09:35.000\nyou'd like stop and turn around because you didn't,\n\n09:35.000 --> 09:37.000\nyou're like, there's a lot of juggalos

touches on it briefly.\n\n13:51.000 --> 13:53.000\nThen it goes away and then it comes back.\n\n13:53.000 --> 13:55.000\nThen it drills down really hard on that.\n\n13:55.000 --> 13:56.000\nYeah.\n\n13:56.000 --> 13:57.000\nKind of goes away again.\n\n13:57.000 --> 13:58.000\nYeah.\n\n13:58.000 --> 14:04.000\nBut if I were like working out at the gym,\n\n14:04.000 -->

18:31.000\nDid you guys get that?\n\n18:31.000 --> 18:32.000\nI was on a treadmill.\n\n18:32.000 --> 18:36.000\nYeah, you were booping.\n\n18:36.000 --> 18:38.000\nReally adjusted all the speeds there.\n\n18:38.000 --> 18:40.000\nI really am out of shape.\n\n18:40.000 --> 18:41.000\nI haven't worked out in a long time.\n\n18:41.000 --> 18:48.000\nDo you guys have any phobias that are genuine phobias?\n\n18:48.000 --> 18:53.980\ndefinition is not just being scared of something a lot or more than other people, but phobia\n\n18:53.980 --> 19:02.900\nis a fear that would interfere with your ability to function in a certain situation. If you're\n\n19:02.900 --> 19:05.300\nunable to go out on a balcony.\n\n19:05.300 --> 19:15.000\nYeah. I don't know that I have a phobia by definition. I've had a couple of freakouts\n\n19:15.000 --> 19:21.840\nthat I didn't, when I didn't know I had this sort of, like one time we were shooting something\n\n19:21.840 --> 19:29.060\nand I had to wear a space suit for this sketch that we were doing and I put on a, and they\n\n19:29.060 --> 19:34.500\ngot it, for some reason they got a real space suit from NASA, like a legit space suit with\n\n19:34.500 --> 19:43.020\na helmet and everything. And I put the helmet on and it screws on to the neck thing and\n\n19:43.020 --> 19:49.420\nall of a sudden I couldn't get it off and nobody could get it off. And I had a fucking\n\n19:49.420 --> 19:52.660\nfreakout panic attack, like I was like get it off, get it off, get it off, get it off,\n\n19:52.660 --> 19:56.020\nget it off. And no one was like okay just calm down, calm down, and like the thing,\n\n19:56.020 --> 20:01.020\nlike the visor was closed and so it was like fogging up and you know I just instantly thought\n\n20:01.020 --> 20:06.740\nlike oh I'm just going to run out of air and I would have been fine if I had just relaxed\n\n20:06.740 --> 20:10.980\nbut so I had a major freakout. That's not a phobia though. Because that was impending\n\n20:10.980 --> 20:17.260\ndeath. I guess I'm scared of space suits. For space. Astronauts.\n\n20:17.260 --> 20:23.380\nYeah, when I was a kid and we would play hide and go seek and stuff in the neighborhood\n\n20:23.380 --> 20:32.500\nflashlight tag, I would, I was like, my strategy was I would find the creepiest, darkest, tightest\n\n20:32.500 --> 20:37.180\nfucking place where any human being would never even look because it'd be like why\n\n20:37.180 --> 20:41.740\nwould a person even fit in there or go in there and then I would just hang out in there\n\n20:41.740 --> 20:47.420\nuntil the game was over and come out victorious. But like I and then at some point I wonder\n\n20:47.420 --> 20:51.180\nif puberty does it or if it's did I bring it up because another thing I used to do is\n\n20:51.180 --> 20:55.700\njust let bugs and shit crawl all over me. But I think I know what happened there is\n\n20:55.700 --> 21:02.860\nlike I was so fascinated with bugs and spiders and stuff that my aunt gave me for Christmas\n\n21:02.860 --> 21:12.580\ngift. A big time life book of big full color hardcover book full of the most poisonous spiders\n\n21:12.580 --> 21:17.780\nin the world and like these crazy like close up photography and like all these statistics\n\n21:17.780 --> 21:21.820\nabout how fast they can crawl up your arm and go in your ear and stuff and like I think\n\n21:21.820 --> 21:27.900\nthe book freaked me out made me start thinking of spiders as I think maybe I don't know\n\n21:27.900 --> 21:33.100\nthough. So are you currently claustrophobic and terrified of spiders? Yes. Okay. Yeah\n\n21:33.100 --> 21:37.460\nso I don't know. Did it change? We had a really funny prank we were going to do. And\n\n21:37.460 --> 21:42.940\nit called coffin full of spiders. I mean everyone's I wonder about you know when it\n\n21:42.940 --> 21:48.140\ncomes to being afraid of being locked in a coffin and buried alive that's not a phobia\n\n21:48.140 --> 21:51.740\nthat's just I think everybody yeah everyone has that fear and it's not an irrational\n\n21:51.740 --> 21:56.340\nfear. Yeah. You should be afraid of that. You'd be it'd be weird it'd be a weird disorder\n\n21:56.340 --> 22:01.820\nif you were if you were into it. I've done that and yeah again that's not really a phobia\n\n22:01.820 --> 22:06.980\nI guess but one time I sound like I shoot a lot of things but we were doing some pilot\n\n22:06.980 --> 22:11.300\nthat didn't get picked up and I was supposed to be dead and but they were shipping my body\n\n22:11.300 --> 22:17.460\nback home or something so I was in a coffin and just for this one scene but it was filled\n\n22:17.460 --> 22:22.100\nwith coffee beans so they covered me in coffee beans because they were like smuggling my body\n\n22:22.100 --> 22:26.220\nout of the country or something like that. So I had to lay in this coffin as they buried\n\n22:26.220 --> 22:31.060\nme in coffee beans like over my face and then they shut the coffin and I will say that was\n\n22:31.060 --> 22:35.540\nnot cool. Jesus. Yeah that was pretty freaky. Good news is when that really happens you will\n\n22:35.540 --> 22:41.300\nbe dead. Yes. So you have to worry about it. Yeah. Unless you get buried alive on accident\n\n22:41.300 --> 22:45.980\nwhat do you mean. You still did. At that point you're like 15 minutes away from dead. Yeah.\n\n22:45.980 --> 22:51.380\nYeah the most horrible death. What are you afraid of Brandon. The dentist I cannot stand\n\n22:51.380 --> 22:55.460\nthe dentist. Really. Yeah I have to get all doped up. I have to get a car service. It's\n\n22:55.460 --> 22:59.100\na nightmare. Really not stand the dentist. I didn't have it. It was because we have a\n\n22:59.100 --> 23:07.380\nfunny prank plan for you. What. No. A coffin full of dentists. God damn it. Dressed as\n\n23:07.380 --> 23:13.180\nspiders. Yeah right. With coffee beans. So do you just not go to the dentist. No I go\n\n23:13.180 --> 23:16.540\nto the dentist all the time because I'm terrible. I mean all the time. I mean I go to the dentist\n\n23:16.540 --> 23:23.420\na lot. Yeah too much. Too much. I'm currently dating my dentist. I have a I have a deep\n\n23:23.420 --> 23:30.220\ncleaning coming up. Yeah. At Hollywood dental. Steve Levy booked me a dentist. Shout out Hollywood\n\n23:30.220 --> 23:36.900\ndental. All your dental needs. They're the keys to the bathroom are on a little Oscar\n\n23:36.900 --> 23:44.620\ntrophies. Does he have headshots of like famous people. I think I think so. You think I would\n\n23:44.620 --> 23:52.980\nhave looked at him. But the whole place is that's themed after like fame. It's a famed\n\n23:52.980 --> 23:58.700\nthemed dentist. I found a little tacky. That's a great theme. And I texted Levy I was like\n\n23:58.700 --> 24:04.740\nreally Hollywood Hollywood themed dentist place. And he's like it's got a really good\n\n24:04.740 --> 24:10.460\nreputation. And I was like well yeah that's really fancy. I mean there's stars everywhere\n\n24:10.460 --> 24:16.420\nand but I don't know. Did you just read their press release or I feel like the next sexual\n\n24:16.420 --> 24:22.420\nharassment thing the next wave is going to be in the dental world just because that seems\n\n24:22.420 --> 24:28.940\nlike it would be so easy. Yeah. You know all of your patients are asleep and certainly\n\n24:28.940 --> 24:32.700\nthere are tons of stories of waking up and there's like a dick on your shoulder. Right.\n\n24:32.700 --> 24:36.060\nYou're pointing at me like I did. I didn't do that. Yeah there are. No there are tons\n\n24:36.060 --> 24:40.380\nof those stories. I put my dick on the dentist shoulder when well we had a wave of those.\n\n24:40.380 --> 24:45.260\nYeah. I mean speaking of things that I'm surprised haven't come up and given the current climate\n\n24:45.260 --> 24:50.020\nlike man Sean Penn must be just in a fucking cellar somewhere with a crossbow pointed at\n\n24:50.020 --> 24:56.460\nthe door. Yeah it seems like there would be a lot of people that are like oh it's almost\n\n24:56.460 --> 25:02.220\nlike it's almost like some people whose savagery was outed 20 years ago are like getting some\n\n25:02.220 --> 25:07.500\nkind of grandfathered in or something. Yeah. Oh yeah. Like I type it down into a chair\n\n25:07.500 --> 25:13.060\nand beater for three days but you know I got caught doing that. I paid my debt to society\n\n25:13.060 --> 25:17.100\nby making some movies. Yeah. Let's all still play Chris Brown and\n\n25:17.100 --> 25:23.900\nR Kelly. Yeah. It's the craziest thing. It seems like there's it's going to like spread\n\n25:23.900 --> 25:30.620\nto pro sports and music people. Those are easy though. Yeah. So easy. I want like every\n\n25:30.620 --> 25:36.460\nindustry to start Wall Street and yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I want doctors and dentists and mailmen\n\n25:36.460 --> 25:41.740\nI want the whole mailman. Yeah. You know mailman get down. My mailman comes to my door with\n\n25:41.740 --> 25:46.500\nhis dick out. Are you guys scared that it's going to extend\n\n25:46.500 --> 25:55.460\nto like just like secrets though like private victimless stuff that just makes you a sicko\n\n25:55.460 --> 26:03.100\nlike if I if we start opening laptops and looking at bookmarks and stuff like like is\n\n26:03.100 --> 26:06.260\nit do you ever worry that it's just going to get to that where it's like what do you think\n\n26:06.260 --> 26:11.580\nabout when you masturbate or what it seems like it seems like there would be a line\n\n26:11.580 --> 26:18.100\nsomewhere where and also just it seems like eventually there will be so much of it that\n\n26:18.100 --> 26:21.460\nnone of it resonates. Do you know what I mean. Right. Yeah. I keep\n\n26:21.460 --> 26:26.620\nworrying about that too. Like they're being too much of a backlash. Yeah. Or once it comes\n\n26:26.620 --> 26:33.780\nout once somebody proves that any of that and that didn't mean to derail us into this\n\n26:33.780 --> 26:36.100\nconversation. I don't think you did. I think I probably\n\n26:36.100 --> 26:44.860\nbut I don't reason why we brought it up. But eventually someone will will get caught making\n\n26:44.860 --> 26:49.060\nit up. Someone will be like oh I made it up. I was trying to get money or whatever and\n\n26:49.060 --> 26:55.220\nthen that will that scares me because that could discredit the whole situation or or\n\n26:55.220 --> 26:58.620\ndelete the whole. I also worry about either between that or\n\n26:58.620 --> 27:05.580\njust the sheer volume of it and the breadth of it that like it'll play into you know men's\n\n27:05.580 --> 27:10.420\nhands and they can go like see what happens after like a year and a half of it. Yeah.\n\n27:10.420 --> 27:16.260\nThat men will go see ladies. Yeah. You just you can't you can't run the party.\n\n27:16.260 --> 27:20.460\nRight. This is this has gotten crazy. You know why don't we and then it's going to and\n\n27:20.460 --> 27:25.140\nthen we just go into Handmaid's Tale because it like gets so like if something happens\n\n27:25.140 --> 27:28.860\nwhere like a dude gets burnt alive. I haven't seen Handmaid's Tale. No spoilers.\n\n27:28.860 --> 27:33.980\nYeah. But like like if there was a yeah I guess I'm saying the same thing you are going\n\n27:33.980 --> 27:37.780\nto be like if there was like some crazy thing or like a guy got stoned to death or something\n\n27:37.780 --> 27:43.700\nat an Albertsons and then and then it was the wrong Jeremy Piven. It was like Jeremiah\n\n27:43.700 --> 27:51.060\nPiven. Yeah. And he was like a feminist activist. There is not his way to paint a sign right\n\n27:51.060 --> 27:56.580\nnow. There's a Brian Posein and a Brian Posein. Brian Posein has just been outed. Oh really\n\n27:56.580 --> 28:01.900\nin Chicago. It's a big deal in the comedy community. And there's an L.A. group of people\n\n28:01.900 --> 28:08.340\nwho know about him. But Brian Posein is getting teased a little bit of the drama. I feel bad\n\n28:08.340 --> 28:13.780\nfor real Joe Walsh because there's that Joe Walsh guy on Twitter. He's like always like\n\n28:13.780 --> 28:17.780\nhey you ever notice Santa Claus isn't black or whatever. And then yeah that confused me\n\n28:17.780 --> 28:21.380\nand it's always just Joe Walsh. And then like what the fuck. And then people will make jokes\n\n28:21.380 --> 28:27.580\nlike hey you're you're living a life of illusion if you don't think that you know the health\n\n28:27.580 --> 28:32.660\ncare should be socialized. I'm like this is so confusing and sad like I thought for a\n\n28:32.660 --> 28:36.740\nhot second that Joe Walsh had become like a P.J. O'Rourke figure or something that he\n\n28:36.740 --> 28:41.540\nwas like. I did too. Yeah. He was like life's been good to me so far. Life's been really\n\n28:41.540 --> 28:46.180\ngood to me so far. Yeah. You know what. And it's because I worked hard. Yeah. Pulled\n\n28:46.180 --> 28:53.940\na Guinness Miller. I pulled myself up by my bootstraps. No but Jeff Davis knows the real\n\n28:53.940 --> 28:59.380\nJoe Walsh who's still out there bopping around and being groovy and playing with the Eagles.\n\n28:59.380 --> 29:04.580\nLike did Glenn Fry died right. Yeah. Yeah. So I guess I think maybe Glenn Fry's death\n\n29:04.580 --> 29:10.020\nlike brought the other Eagles closer and now they're like I think touring and stuff. Oh\n\n29:10.020 --> 29:15.420\nreally. Something for you kids to get excited about. The audience is going crazy. Right.\n\n29:15.420 --> 29:25.380\nWe're going nuts. Cold War kids will be opening for them. If that means anything to you kids.\n\n29:25.380 --> 29:31.500\nI wonder if like if you are in a band that has seen better days let's say you know you\n\n29:31.500 --> 29:37.980\nguys were big at one point or legendary at one point but you still have to live and make\n\n29:37.980 --> 29:42.700\na living and that's what you've been doing your whole life like I wonder if it eventually\n\n29:42.700 --> 29:48.500\nstarts to suck when you're just like doing county fairs. And you know you're like she's\n\n29:48.500 --> 29:55.460\nmy cherry fuck. Yeah. I'm sure there's no offense to warrant or if that's the total\n\n29:55.460 --> 30:00.060\noffense. Yeah. I'm sure there's bands against each individual each individual band and a\n\n30:00.060 --> 30:05.420\ncase by case big like some of them are excited about it and some of them are like like hate\n\n30:05.420 --> 30:10.660\nit but it's like yeah we're not usually when somebody gets sick in the band and they're\n\n30:10.660 --> 30:15.740\nlike we got to get together because Garth's going to need a kidney and he didn't invest\n\n30:15.740 --> 30:21.500\nso good after rehab and that's always kind of sweet to see. It's also kind of dark because\n\n30:21.500 --> 30:24.980\nthe lead singer is like still prosperous and goes off on his own and kind of looks back\n\n30:24.980 --> 30:33.260\nat his band like I mean I'm Pharrell. Yeah. Fuck Garth. Fuck Garth. I'm Pharrell and you\n\n30:33.260 --> 30:40.540\nguys are nerd. It's great. Prince will get the revolution back together again because\n\n30:40.540 --> 30:47.300\nLisa and Wendy need something. Lisa and Wendy need socks. They spent all their sock money.\n\n30:47.300 --> 30:56.020\nYeah. I like that Pharrell and Garth are out there together. I let you know. New edition\n\n30:56.020 --> 31:00.300\nwas like we got a Bobby Brown. We got to do something. We got to do it. We got to help\n\n31:00.300 --> 31:13.860\nhim out. Yeah. I hope that I find a billion dollars under a rock tomorrow so I can curl\n\n31:13.860 --> 31:26.140\nup under my bed and wait for the world to end. That might happen. Give me a beat. I'm\n\n31:26.140 --> 31:39.180\nnot working out to this. Zip it is. Zip it is. Yeah. Tomas Tomas Tomas. Yeah. French\n\n31:39.180 --> 31:47.620\nrapping. Tomas in the house. MC Tomas. Tomas. Tomas.

I just like to tease him at the end with an\n\n34:00.140 --> 34:03.420\nadventure to a bog. It sounds like there was going to be a pretty cool adventure in that\n\n34:03.420 --> 34:08.100\nbog. Yeah. Yeah. People were going there with the stick. Yeah. I have to wait to see what\n\n34:08.100 --> 34:13.380\nhappens. I was super into the Tolhouse thing and then it was not, he was saying show him\n\n34:13.380 --> 34:19.380\nhow we do it. Yeah. Yeah. I thought he was saying Tomas. I wasn't sure. I probably don't\n\n34:19.380 --> 34:22.500\nneed to tell you. I couldn't tell what he was saying. Yeah. And he was throwing me.\n\n34:22.500 --> 34:28.540\nMy street when I was growing up was Tolhouse Road. No. Yeah. So I was I was pretty psyched\n\n34:28.540 --> 34:35.580\nabout that when I was little. Did people make jokes? A lot of people. I was harassed a lot.\n\n34:35.580 --> 34:42.620\nPeople were like oh you fucking elf. You know. It was terrible. It was like now I can laugh\n\n34:42.620 --> 34:46.380\nabout it. And if you corrected them and said that's Kebler. That's right. They'd be like\n\n34:46.380 --> 34:51.380\noh now you're a cookie expert. So you are an elf. That's right. There's no point in\n\n34:51.380 --> 35:00.020\neven trying to correct it. Yeah. Everybody thought I was the Tolhouse cookie elf. I\n\n35:00.020 --> 35:09.620\nlived on 52nd in Calumet. Is that in Manhattan? Nope. Just sounds like it's in Milwaukee.\n\n35:09.620 --> 35:15.940\nMy dog got hit on that road on Calumet. Calumet was a busy street. And if I ever want to make\n\n35:15.940 --> 35:24.060\nmyself cry like when I'm acting, I can just think about the sound that my dog Susu made\n\n35:24.060 --> 35:32.700\nwhen she got hit. It was like a hit and run. And it was like crazy sound. Sound of the\n\n35:32.700 --> 35:41.260\ncar. I remember. And then and then this like plaintiff whale that Susu made before just\n\n35:41.260 --> 35:46.300\ndropping dead. It's like she got hit and then went and then just made the sound and then\n\n35:46.300 --> 35:53.860\ndied. And then I and then my dad had to go out and like scoop her up. And I was like\n\n35:53.860 --> 35:58.860\na little kid was like an eye level with the dog as it was swinging in his hand. And he\n\n35:58.860 --> 36:03.700\nhad this like annoyed look on his face. He was like really mad that the dog got hit.\n\n36:03.700 --> 36:13.460\nOh, you've got to say give me a beat. A very long rap about your childhood pet getting\n\n36:13.460 --> 36:20.100\nkilled. Yeah, I'm not going to dwell on this topic for long, but I remember our neighbors\n\n36:20.100 --> 36:25.260\nhit our cat and killed our cat one of our cats when we were little kids. And you know,\n\n36:25.260 --> 36:29.900\nthey felt terrible and they came to the door. And the first thing out of their mouth was\n\n36:29.900 --> 36:37.220\ncan we buy you a new cat? And we were like, why? What? Like, you know, they're like started\n\n36:37.220 --> 36:46.820\nthree new cats. Bidding started three. They packed our house with so many cats and all\n\n36:46.820 --> 36:52.180\nwas forgiven. No, it was just that was such a weird inclination on their part. Like this\n\n36:52.180 --> 36:58.060\nhappened. Would it? We'll just get you a new one. It's like, are you not aware that we\n\n36:58.060 --> 37:07.020\nwere attached to this? I know you're trying to be nice, but they didn't know what to say.\n\n37:07.020 --> 37:12.060\nIn their defense, a third my therapist tells me a third of an apology is a commitment to\n\n37:12.060 --> 37:15.620\nchange. How do you how do you commit to change? You know, it was either that or we promised\n\n37:15.620 --> 37:24.540\nnot to hit your next cat. Yeah, we will not hit your next cat. I left my house once to\n\n37:24.540 --> 37:31.980\ngo out and play. And these are just all going to be sad childhood stories. Yeah. And I played\n\n37:31.980 --> 37:37.420\nwhat do you do in an empty warehouse? You know, we don't want to bring out our fucking blue\n\n37:37.420 --> 37:45.860\nchip roast material. Dean Martin drinks, ladies and gentlemen. There were a couple victories\n\n37:45.860 --> 37:53.620\nin life, though. I ran I ran I ran I ran out into the into the neighborhood and played\n\n37:53.620 --> 37:59.820\nfor several hours and came home and and my mom was waiting at the porch and she said,\n\n37:59.820 --> 38:05.380\ndo you remember me telling you as you left to bring the kitten inside? So we had a new\n\n38:05.380 --> 38:14.780\nkitten and it was it was on a leash to let it play outside on a collar. And then and\n\n38:14.780 --> 38:23.580\nI said, no, I don't remember. Still don't remember mom instruction. I'll take your word\n\n38:23.580 --> 38:37.300\nfor it. But it's not going to bring Mr. T back. I don't think it was Mr. T that died.\n\n38:37.300 --> 38:46.220\nBut it apparently there was a tomato tower in the garden next to the front door and it\n\n38:46.220 --> 38:55.460\nwas on this long like kind of just leash line like a lightweight clothes line kind of thing\n\n38:55.460 --> 39:01.020\nthat was like long enough to let it like explore and play. And he loved tomatoes and he loved\n\n39:01.020 --> 39:06.380\nwalking in circles around the perimeter of tomato towers and didn't wasn't a primate.\n\n39:06.380 --> 39:12.900\nSo did not have the thought of doing the opposite of what you've been doing when it gets hard\n\n39:12.900 --> 39:19.380\nto breathe. So it just kept apparently it just hung itself just like and my mom informed\n\n39:19.380 --> 39:26.220\nme of this. I didn't have to come home to it. But I did have to hear the story and definitely\n\n39:26.220 --> 39:32.620\nthe headline was that it was my fault. You should have. Yeah, I do like the style choice\n\n39:32.620 --> 39:38.500\nof ask the question. Do you remember when I told you to bring the cat in? Oh, you don't\n\n39:38.500 --> 39:44.620\nremember. Well, that explains why the cat's dead. It's kind of a it's a pretty clever\n\n39:44.620 --> 39:49.820\ntactic. Yeah. It's like because because it'd be like if it'd be like yeah, I do remember\n\n39:49.820 --> 39:54.620\nshe if she was making it up. She'd be like, Oh, sweet. Fuck it. And then you should have\n\n39:54.620 --> 39:58.780\ndone it mother fucker because you killed your cat. And then she'd be like she'd go into\n\n39:58.780 --> 40:07.460\na room like whoa. Fuck. In your defense, he could have been dead before she asked you\n\n40:07.460 --> 40:10.620\nto bring, you know, he could have been there from the day before. I don't know when the\n\n40:10.620 --> 40:13.940\nlast time was. Yeah, well, I don't remember. I don't know the time. Well, I don't think\n\n40:13.940 --> 40:18.060\nwe weren't really good. We're not like hillbillies. We didn't like leave our cat out for two days\n\n40:18.060 --> 40:21.980\nand not know. It was just like it was like a rare thing to like. Yeah, you know, it's\n\n40:21.980 --> 40:30.040\nlike we weren't it was but this thing is I don't remember. I don't fuck mom. No, I don't\n\n40:30.040 --> 40:35.420\nremember that. You're grown. Yeah, I don't fucking 44. I've been trying to remember it\n\n40:35.420 --> 40:40.860\nmy whole life. You know what? I don't fucking remember you saying that cat would fuck you.\n\n40:40.860 --> 40:45.860\nI want to know what a tomato tower is. It's like a is it the little pyramid thing that\n\n40:45.860 --> 40:53.580\nyou it's like a more like a cylinder. I would say, you know, with a slightly wire. Yeah,\n\n40:53.580 --> 40:58.260\nit's why it's a wire cylinder. Yeah, like a slight. It's not quite a true cylinder because\n\n40:58.260 --> 41:02.900\nthe top is a little lesser diameter than the bottom. It's kind of like a Tower of Pisa\n\n41:02.900 --> 41:09.420\nkind of. That's not accurate. But but like it's like a tomato tower, tomato towers. I\n\n41:09.420 --> 41:16.620\nguess the idea is that the tomato will get born and then grab the tower. And I guess\n\n41:16.620 --> 41:20.340\nthe idea is that you don't want your kitten to do that. You don't want it to like cling\n\n41:20.340 --> 41:26.780\nto the tower the way a tomato does. They don't make kitten towers. Nope. Nope. Maybe at the\n\n41:26.780 --> 41:34.060\nHumane Society, they have they have an array of those in the back. Come on back here, guys.\n\n41:34.060 --> 41:40.020\nHere's some tomato towers. Have a blast. We'll be back in 10 minutes. They'll all be dead.\n\n41:40.020 --> 41:47.380\nWe we we love our pets. We love animals. We love our innocent dogs and cats. We we are\n\n41:47.380 --> 41:54.940\nable to touch emotions when we think about them that we are not able to access when we\n\n41:54.940 --> 42:09.300\nthink about human beings. Give me a beat. Yo, this goes out to all the pets I killed. Sorry,\n\n42:09.300 --> 42:15.140\nRover. Sorry muffin. Sorry. Sorry that about all the stuff in that I let you eat a choke\n\n42:15.140 --> 42:24.980\non to death. Sorry. Sorry, Beth, about the cat that I shot with my BB gun through the\n\n42:24.980 --> 42:35.980\neye. Why I'm associated path to be a serial killer, but I don't have bravery or a support\n\n42:35.980 --> 42:43.580\nsystem. Jeffrey Dahmer is in the house tonight. Clean out that crawl space play with the bones\n\n42:43.580 --> 42:52.140\ntonight. Squirrel bones, chipmunk bones, decapitated heads, Ed Kemper in effect, fucked his mother's\n\n42:52.140 --> 43:02.820\nhead after her death. Cut her head off just to make her stop talking. Turn her off. Man,\n\n43:02.820 --> 43:12.380\nmindhunter. Cruelty to animals. It's the number one sign according to the FBI that you're\n\n43:12.380 --> 43:17.940\ngoing to have make people die when you become a person that's grown up. So don't let your\n\n43:17.940 --> 43:24.980\nkids torture your pups. Take them to the therapist. Say, fix this bitch. Don't wait to stitch\n\n43:24.980 --> 43:31.380\nnine stitches instead of doing a stitch in time. A stitch in time saves nine with the\n\n43:31.380 --> 43:37.500\nsociopath. Put that kid in the bath. Hold their head down. Maybe drown your kid. Might\n\n43:37.500 --> 43:43.300\nsave a couple hundred people's kids. If your kid's already dumb and you know that, then\n\n43:43.300 --> 43:58.060\njust take your thumb and put it over their trachea and push until you hear a pop. If\n\n43:58.060 --> 44:08.460\nyou think it's going to be a murderer, otherwise don't kill your kid. Yo, but here's what\n\n44:08.460 --> 44:15.980\nMC Lycoris did. Yo, I'm MC Lycoris. What I did was kind of ridiculous. I started a shelter\n\n44:15.980 --> 44:22.780\nfor wayward youth, children at risk. This is what we do. We make them play foosball and\n\n44:22.780 --> 44:27.340\nweaves baskets and go to the mall and we take them to the zoo and say, look at those lions\n\n44:27.340 --> 44:32.540\nand they don't grow up to be death trying. They grow up to be lawyers and doctors and\n\n44:32.540 --> 44:37.980\nthey work for Gamble and they work for Proctor. My name is MC Lycoris and I took a proactive\n\n44:37.980 --> 44:46.300\nstance, tried to turn shit around. Way to high road me. MC Lycoris. Sorry, I wasn't\n\n44:46.300 --> 44:53.500\nas fucking optimistic as you. I don't believe half the shit you just said. Why don't you\n\n44:53.500 --> 44:58.020\ncome over here instead? Try talking that shit to me instead of behind my back. Does it seem\n\n44:58.020 --> 45:02.940\nlike it's behind your back? Fucking idiot. It's the microphone. Oh shit. Tough guy when\n\n45:02.940 --> 45:24.460\nyou're alone. Alright, I'm coming over there. Oh shit. Let me go, Jackson. Fuck you, fuck\n\n45:24.460 --> 45:32.340\nyou. We just had an awkward fight. My shirts are all stretched to the right. Big collars\n\n45:32.340 --> 45:38.300\nboth turned out to fight like pussies. It's both, it's embarrassing for both of us. MC\n\n45:38.300 --> 45:51.100\nLycoris and me, Stan Schmengel, sociopathic, non serial killer, animal torturer. I'll tell\n\n45:51.100 --> 45:56.140\nyou about the time that I took a knife and I threatened a giraffe for its life. I said,\n\n45:56.140 --> 46:00.300\ngive me your wallet or stoop down. He said, I got too long a neck. I'm not going to clown\n\n46:00.300 --> 46:05.100\naround. I got to eat leaves that are way up high. I said, motherfucking giraffe, now you're\n\n46:05.100 --> 46:08.620\ngonna die. Give me, give me all your money. He said, I don't have none. I said, that's\n\n46:08.620 --> 46:13.860\nright, son. That's right, son. You're a broke-ass giraffe because I'm a primate and I'll tell\n\n46:13.860 --> 46:20.820\nyou what I do. I lift weights in the penitentiary just to get strong. I didn't spend too long\n\n46:20.820 --> 46:29.740\nribby rehabilitating. I just came in the safari. I'm going to fucking rob wild game. It's what\n\n46:29.740 --> 46:38.020\nI do. Rhinos, give me your money. Okay. Oh God. Yeah. No, why did I think that rap wouldn't\n\n46:38.020 --> 46:41.900\nbe horrible and dark when I said, give me a beat after talking about animal cruelty.\n\n46:41.900 --> 46:47.500\nThey got a little bit dark. I didn't, I never have shot an animal with a BB gun in case anyone\n\n46:47.500 --> 46:51.100\nthinks that's how freestyling works. Certainly not. You would have been a great serial killer.\n\n46:51.100 --> 46:55.240\nI've never been cruel to an animal. If you had some support. Yeah. That was my favorite\n\n46:55.240 --> 47:03.340\nline. You did bring up a good point also about cruelty to animals being such an indicator\n\n47:03.340 --> 47:09.980\nfor future sociopathic tendencies. It seems like if you are a person that is cruel to\n\n47:09.980 --> 47:13.340\nan animal, they should just put you in jail. That would save so many human lives. Yeah.\n\n47:13.340 --> 47:17.700\nYeah. I mean, how many times did you hear when you were a kid with some asshole in the\n\n47:17.700 --> 47:20.140\nneighborhood that like did some fucked up thing to a cat or something and like bragged\n\n47:20.140 --> 47:23.500\nabout it? Because it's like they can't help but brag about it. And it's like they don't\n\n47:23.500 --> 47:29.700\nall become serial killers, but they definitely like that's just because they don't like whatever\n\n47:29.700 --> 47:34.780\nit's like they're what if you, because it doesn't even matter what your stance is about\n\n47:34.780 --> 47:40.940\nanimals. Like like whether you're PETA full blown, like no animals should ever be hurt\n\n47:40.940 --> 47:46.260\nand you know, the eggs you ate this morning are a crime and stuff or if you're like way\n\n47:46.260 --> 47:50.340\nover on the other side and are like, no, if it's not a cuddly adorable dog, I don't give\n\n47:50.340 --> 47:55.020\na fuck about animals or even if you're like the kind of person like like hates cats and\n\n47:55.020 --> 48:00.220\nshit. Like people that are just like they torture animals like they like they like they they\n\n48:00.220 --> 48:05.340\ndo shit to cats and stuff like where they like they fuck with them like just to fuck\n\n48:05.340 --> 48:06.340\nwith them.\n\n48:06.340 --> 48:12.340\nBut why not just lock those people up? Yeah. Yeah, it does seem to be an indicator. Because\n\n48:12.340 --> 48:17.340\nit's like what do you what do you do? Like who why would you? Why would you have fun\n\n48:17.340 --> 48:23.100\ndoing that? Yeah, that's the thing is we sort of if you merge the two, like being disrespectful\n\n48:23.100 --> 48:28.980\nto women and animals, there's this whole culture that we kind of got to rethink violence. Because\n\n48:28.980 --> 48:32.580\nI think I think we got lazy with it and we were sort of like, well, that's violent, but\n\n48:32.580 --> 48:36.380\nthat's not violent. This is OK to watch and this is OK to show. And we're sort of at a\n\n48:36.380 --> 48:40.620\nplace where it looks like we might want to look at all of that again. And that that might\n\n48:40.620 --> 48:45.900\nbe one of the first things we do is be like animals. Let's start with animals and work\n\n48:45.900 --> 48:52.340\nour way up to humans through women. Yeah, is what we're applying because it's wrong.\n\n48:52.340 --> 48:59.860\nYeah. Yeah. Where are we? Where are we headed? I think my optimistic view of it is that we\n\n48:59.860 --> 49:05.740\nare rototilling the fabric of society right now. Like we're yeah, that's the theory I've\n\n49:05.740 --> 49:10.700\nI've heard other people mention also, which I just jackhammering the concrete. And it's\n\n49:10.700 --> 49:15.300\nlike, of course, that's not going to feel comfortable or or even righteous. Sometimes\n\n49:15.300 --> 49:22.060\nit's going to just feel insane. And every day, someone says, All right, that's enough.\n\n49:22.060 --> 49:26.540\nYou know, because it's a friend of theirs or someone that's like what him? No, that's\n\n49:26.540 --> 49:32.380\nenough. Or this specific story is like, Well, if that's all right, that's enough. But and\n\n49:32.380 --> 49:37.780\nI know, I know, yeah, I think it's just like a jackhammering of the of the concrete and\n\n49:37.780 --> 49:46.300\nthen and then hopefully then if we could just observe what we're doing that that instead\n\n49:46.300 --> 49:53.980\nof there being a backlash that maybe this is the ticket to Oh, we start to adopt a code\n\n49:53.980 --> 50:02.500\nand a principle where we go. I okay, I I subscribe to the sort of equivalent of the Asimov rules\n\n50:02.500 --> 50:07.780\nof robotics or something. There's like a there's like a lost three rules, a litmus test, you\n\n50:07.780 --> 50:13.700\ncan you can rattle off before you have a human encounter, whatever it is. And you got like,\n\n50:13.700 --> 50:17.620\nOkay, so who's harming who or who's getting away with I don't know, there's some like\n\n50:17.620 --> 50:23.820\ncode and that's like a religion that that comes up out of it, where it's not about\n\n50:23.820 --> 50:29.460\nmen versus women or people of color versus white people or whatever it like stops being\n\n50:29.460 --> 50:36.060\nthat because it becomes so chaotic and it becomes so like what Mr. Rogers did that? Oh, no. And\n\n50:36.060 --> 50:41.980\nlike, like, like all of these heroes are funny people are tumbling and there's all this like\n\n50:41.980 --> 50:48.140\ncrazy shit. So we're all so confused that we all cry out at once for order. We go give\n\n50:48.140 --> 50:53.380\nus then tell us what to do tell us how to think. Tell me something to tattoo on my\n\n50:53.380 --> 50:59.460\narms so that I can just look at it give me a symbol of shamrock or a or a circle with\n\n50:59.460 --> 51:05.780\nthree dots on it or something that could represent like the three acid tests of whether or not\n\n51:05.780 --> 51:10.860\nyou're good or evil and then there's and then it can just be about people that subscribe\n\n51:10.860 --> 51:15.740\nto that belief system versus people that don't. Because the belief system I have built into\n\n51:15.740 --> 51:20.700\nit as does animal cruelty, like a kind of like, Well, why would you bother fighting\n\n51:20.700 --> 51:24.900\nthis? Like, and then there would be people going like, I don't believe in that that circle\n\n51:24.900 --> 51:31.420\nwas two dots thing. Why? Well, no one told you to get the tattoo. But why don't you?\n\n51:31.420 --> 51:37.740\nWhy are you? Why are you so scared about that? What's what slippery slope is there for you?\n\n51:37.740 --> 51:42.380\nAnd then those and then we could just like, just choke those people to death, put them\n\n51:42.380 --> 51:43.380\nin prison.\n\n51:43.380 --> 51:47.340\nThe Al Franken thing is sort of something that you just said, which was that when they\n\n51:47.340 --> 51:52.140\nfind out Mr. Rogers has done something weird, and it's so frustrating to hear people sort\n\n51:52.140 --> 51:56.620\nof defend him because you're at this point where you're like, the world assumed that\n\n51:56.620 --> 52:01.380\nonly people you didn't like, right, be found guilty. And it's sort of a wake up call to\n\n52:01.380 --> 52:05.700\nsay it's going to be guys that you like. Yeah, it's going to be people you love fathers and\n\n52:05.700 --> 52:08.980\nbrothers. And we have to say we have the same standard.\n\n52:08.980 --> 52:13.380\nYeah, and what I mean, I'm sure there's like Al Franken's the Al Franken story is getting\n\n52:13.380 --> 52:17.740\npretty close to I'm pretty sure like within 10 years, like, I don't think there's a there's\n\n52:17.740 --> 52:21.900\nprobably not a photo you could dig up of me like honking some titties but like and I don't\n\n52:21.900 --> 52:29.380\nI don't think I ever like, right, but I just I just it's in terms of it's like, well, I\n\n52:29.380 --> 52:34.700\nwould expect that sooner or later, if we were going to like, like put a black light over\n\n52:34.700 --> 52:39.820\nmy entire life, 40 years that there's got to be some narrative where I'm like way out\n\n52:39.820 --> 52:45.940\nof line in my past. And I've I'm I'm definitely not pretending to not remember like I don't\n\n52:45.940 --> 52:51.260\nI don't know if you know, but what I do know is that if there was if there was some like,\n\n52:51.260 --> 52:55.780\nif someone said something, it was like, Oh, yeah, I was doing a show with Dan Harmon and\n\n52:55.780 --> 53:00.500\nhe blah, blah, blah, and he did this and that. And I would go if it was true, they would\n\n53:00.500 --> 53:06.420\ngo, Okay, yeah, that's true. And I that was fucked up. Yeah, I've been I either it was\n\n53:06.420 --> 53:09.340\njust reminded of that because of the story or I've been thinking about that for a long\n\n53:09.340 --> 53:13.900\ntime. And I should I'm really embarrassed about that. But why isn't that basically how Al\n\n53:13.900 --> 53:19.300\nFranken responded? Like, like, I don't know if his apology was like, suitable or whatever.\n\n53:19.300 --> 53:24.100\nBut what's the big, you know, it's like, if you if you didn't actually, it's it should\n\n53:24.100 --> 53:30.460\nbe okay for there to just be like, Oh, yeah, by the way, here's some like shit sprayed\n\n53:30.460 --> 53:39.300\non you. Here's a little die pack on you from 2005. And you should be able to go Yep, sorry.\n\n53:39.300 --> 53:45.260\nAnd the key is evolution in that if we found something about you in 1998, and then we you\n\n53:45.260 --> 53:50.620\nwere still doing it in 2006, sort of like in a Louis situation, I think then people are\n\n53:50.620 --> 53:55.260\nangry. But if we find out that when you were 18, you were inappropriate. But now as a grown\n\n53:55.260 --> 53:59.460\nass man, there's never been a case again against you. Then we see that you've evolved. And I\n\n53:59.460 --> 54:03.420\nthink that's what people are asking for. That's the I think that's the thing that separates\n\n54:03.420 --> 54:04.420\ncases.\n\n54:04.420 --> 54:08.900\nI think the crucial things are cover up dishonesty, stuff like that. Like, yeah, if there's a\n\n54:08.900 --> 54:13.780\ntrail of like, no, I'm gonna, yeah, I'm gonna keep doing this and I'm gonna lie about it\n\n54:13.780 --> 54:19.140\nor like, if it comes forward, and then the person's response is like, that didn't happen,\n\n54:19.140 --> 54:22.900\nlike, okay, then we have to and then it turns out it did happen. Then it's like, okay, but\n\n54:22.900 --> 54:27.460\ndo you understand that you're that doesn't bode well, because you're not, that means\n\n54:27.460 --> 54:31.860\nthat if you could get away with it, you would as opposed to like, Oh, did I do that? Urkel\n\n54:31.860 --> 54:40.660\nwe call it the Urkel. Urkel effect. Just say, did I do that? Just remember Urkel, the Urkel\n\n54:40.660 --> 54:46.420\nprinciple. How do you spell Urkel? And then we'll make up like an acronym for the I yeah,\n\n54:46.420 --> 54:51.940\nI, I, I don't what, how did that come up? I don't know. Oh, the Al Franken thing, I guess.\n\n54:51.940 --> 54:58.660\nYeah, because it's like, well, yeah, he's a senator. I think we should assume that all\n\n54:58.660 --> 55:03.460\npoliticians are fucking creeps for sure, right? Yeah, there's gonna be a shake in your head.\n\n55:03.460 --> 55:09.540\nOh, because of Maxine waters, you're so fucking racist. There's definitely Kamala Harris. I'm not\n\n55:09.540 --> 55:16.980\nracist. Oh, she's black too. There's definitely gonna be a ton of old white men in DC, like\n\n55:16.980 --> 55:21.860\nthey get fucking purged from this. I mean, on both sides, I'm sure, you know, I mean, it just\n\n55:21.860 --> 55:29.300\nshould be no shock to anybody that a senator of any state, I know that should not be okay. And\n\n55:29.300 --> 55:33.780\nI'm glad it's no longer okay. And we should expect that every single fucking one of them is going\n\n55:33.780 --> 55:39.060\nto have somebody come forward and say, like, yeah, because people with power, my therapist said,\n\n55:40.100 --> 55:46.900\nshe's a she's a married lesbian. And she said, does she watch the show? No, I don't think so.\n\n55:46.900 --> 55:52.180\nIf she does, she's smart enough to pretend she doesn't. But because then I think it'd feel\n\n55:52.180 --> 55:57.860\nlike it would ding our therapy or something. But she uses family guy references to like make\n\n55:57.860 --> 56:02.100\nher points. She's like, sometimes Peter Griffin has like an angel on his shoulder. Yeah, and I'm\n\n56:02.100 --> 56:10.180\nlike, I have a cartoon you could use. I know. That is hilarious. I would love to see your face when\n\n56:10.180 --> 56:17.140\nshe says it's exact. I'm like, Yeah, great. As I said, the third time she did a family guy\n\n56:17.140 --> 56:20.660\nreference, I was like, Are you trying to like, we're going to have to have well, he's in comedy.\n\n56:20.660 --> 56:24.500\nHe'll appreciate that I'm trying. I'm going to need to see you twice a week because of your\n\n56:24.500 --> 56:31.380\nreferences are fucking me up like my it's like, like, when do I get some validation? I get it.\n\n56:31.380 --> 56:36.740\nI should let go of the need for that. But like, do you have to wait until she starts to talk about\n\n56:36.740 --> 56:40.740\nit like she doesn't know you're associated with it? Just you should have seen on Rick and Morty.\n\n56:40.740 --> 56:44.660\nDo you watch that show anyway, Dan? You should have seen on Rick and Morty.\n\n56:44.660 --> 56:50.740\nBut she said, she said, listen, it's power. It's the studies and the anecdotal evidence show,\n\n56:50.740 --> 56:57.940\neven in the psychological community, like women who are not only women, but they work in the shrink\n\n56:58.500 --> 57:05.860\nindustry. There's still ways to become empowered as a person to the point where your mind starts\n\n57:05.860 --> 57:14.020\nto bend in you. And it just happens less because women are because we've we've gasoled them into\n\n57:14.020 --> 57:18.180\nlike they don't get as many chances to be in such power that they can like find out.\n\n57:19.380 --> 57:23.380\nShe's saying it's human. Yeah, it's like, it's a person in power thing. I'm still,\n\n57:23.380 --> 57:28.900\nI don't totally, I don't think it's like a split equal thing. I think it's going to take decades\n\n57:28.900 --> 57:35.700\nto convince me that guys aren't like like neurologically like like more fucked up, like just like like\n\n57:36.340 --> 57:45.700\nI just seem but but I do believe her when she says like anybody that gets a ton of power over\n\n57:45.700 --> 57:49.620\nanother human being like there's all that you have to go into that situation with your\n\n57:49.620 --> 57:54.260\nshit together that is not going to bring your shit together in that situation. So there's just\n\n57:54.260 --> 57:59.380\nlike a big, you know, there's syndromes of like powerful women that will just like psychologically\n\n57:59.380 --> 58:04.820\ntorture the dudes underneath them, you know, like, like, like, I think it's probably a smarter and\n\n58:04.820 --> 58:09.780\nmore awesome kind of sexist that when we think about it, we go like that would be awesome.\n\n58:10.660 --> 58:19.460\nBut anyways, I why did that come up because you'd said Kamala Harris, she's actually her\n\n58:19.460 --> 58:27.220\noh yeah so so that's why that's why I'm saying like all like all senators we should just explain\n\n58:27.220 --> 58:32.900\nthere's no there's no harm that can come from assuming that all senators are liars thieves.\n\n58:34.340 --> 58:40.580\nIt is not our patriotic duty to think that someone in office is a good person or honorable like\n\n58:40.580 --> 58:46.180\nit is arguably a patriotic duty is to be skeptical and assume the worst about our\n\n58:46.180 --> 58:52.580\nservants you know. Do you think that this will swing around on Trump or will they just continue\n\n58:52.580 --> 58:57.220\nto say that happened a long time then that's not true? I don't know. I don't know how that\n\n58:57.220 --> 59:00.500\nI don't know if they it's like this elephant around well somebody was mentioning that it's like\n\n59:00.500 --> 59:06.980\nit did him tweeting about how Franken made blood so crazy but also tweeting about it like like\n\n59:06.980 --> 59:11.540\na little poopy boy like it was like oh guess where his hands would have pictured two and three\n\n59:11.540 --> 59:18.020\nit was like he's okay bad it bad it bad it being a billionaire we knew that bad it being president\n\n59:18.020 --> 59:21.860\nbad it and then it turned out we were kind of marveling at wow he's bad at being Hitler\n\n59:21.860 --> 59:29.140\nwow that's a relief he's being bad at being Hitler. I never expected he'd be bad at sexual\n\n59:29.140 --> 59:33.620\nharassment like bad at bad at parsing a titty honk photo I was like do you think it's a he\n\n59:33.620 --> 59:37.620\nthinks it's a missing he thinks there's it's a beginning of a slide show yeah there's a whole\n\n59:37.620 --> 59:43.540\nthough he's like bad at being a douchebag like he's bad at looking at that photo and just going\n\n59:43.540 --> 59:50.340\noh looks like he got the dudes he's like he's like I mean it's like there's a couple ways to\n\n59:50.340 --> 59:56.900\ninterpret his response one is that he looked at that photo and was like okay fine but you know\n\n59:56.900 --> 01:00:02.100\nthat shit got bad in the subsequent photos like that he because he didn't look at it as a bad thing\n\n01:00:02.740 --> 01:00:07.220\nyes because in his world he's used to getting busted for so much more he's like if that was\n\n01:00:07.220 --> 01:00:13.700\nnumber one god knows what two through five are the other the other way to interpret it is that he\n\n01:00:13.700 --> 01:00:21.060\ngot a hard on and was just sharing it with America it was just going like whoa look at that like\n\n01:00:21.700 --> 01:00:29.700\ndid all of his did all of his accusers just get paid off like how did that all just go away I don't\n\n01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:38.260\nknow I don't know I all I know is that people are you know when people say oh but what about this guy\n\n01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:43.220\nI was like well let him run their their sexual predator guy like why are we trying to like\n\n01:00:43.220 --> 01:00:47.300\npull him out of the race and all this stuff like like if you pull him out of the race then they've\n\n01:00:47.300 --> 01:00:51.940\nthey've already learned that you know it's neck and neck with a pedophile running so just get a\n\n01:00:51.940 --> 01:00:57.620\nfind a non pedophile they like they would love them for him to be disqualified that's a do over\n\n01:00:57.620 --> 01:01:02.580\nso I was I was making that argument like just just run your pedophile like like like and and\n\n01:01:02.580 --> 01:01:07.380\nthey're like yeah and then and then he's gonna win I'm like well then let the games begin yeah you\n\n01:01:07.380 --> 01:01:12.020\nknow like like I know that there's this bigger chess game like where oh we got a topple the we\n\n01:01:12.020 --> 01:01:18.100\ngot to get the majority but that's how they're thinking so much that they're running a pedophile\n\n01:01:18.100 --> 01:01:25.140\nso let's like it's not like oh be Christ like and just let them run the game but when it's when\n\n01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:29.300\nit's that when there's that much tumble to the point where they're like banging shoes on the table\n\n01:01:29.300 --> 01:01:36.740\nsaying like you know it like it's like okay there's a there's a larger loss here for them yeah yeah\n\n01:01:36.740 --> 01:01:41.300\nyeah I think they should right they should be forced to run that guy like what like why should that\n\n01:01:41.300 --> 01:01:45.940\nI mean obviously it they don't have to see them once he wins the election yeah I mean\n\n01:01:45.940 --> 01:01:54.420\nyou just yeah I think that how bad would it be to lose to the pedophile to be the fucking\n\n01:01:55.620 --> 01:02:00.980\nI mean that's your claim to fame hey yeah particularly because I lost to the pedophile\n\n01:02:00.980 --> 01:02:05.860\nin Alabama he's the lawyer that went after the people who killed the four girls in a church\n\n01:02:05.860 --> 01:02:10.420\nyeah they were blown out of so that that even sends a larger message the fact that it's neck and neck\n\n01:02:10.420 --> 01:02:14.900\nyeah it's terrifying I don't think it's neck and neck anymore not anymore but it's it was eight points\n\n01:02:14.900 --> 01:02:19.940\nthree days ago now we're up to four points back oh really so it's these are also poles in Alabama\n\n01:02:19.940 --> 01:02:25.140\nthese are like phone poles what kind of idiot is picking up their landline in Alabama you know\n\n01:02:25.140 --> 01:02:32.340\nTammy sessions yeah hello we saw the headline that said that oh god it was some statistic about like\n\n01:02:35.060 --> 01:02:39.460\nI'm pulling this number out of my ass but it was like the actual numbers I'm pulling on my ass but\n\n01:02:39.460 --> 01:02:49.300\nso but it was like six out of ten evangelicals in Alabama say that now that they know about this\n\n01:02:49.300 --> 01:02:55.460\nthey're they're they're sending their endorsement no they want to vote for them twice or whatever\n\n01:02:55.460 --> 01:02:59.460\nthat it was like that they're doubling down however they express that that they're more likely to vote\n\n01:03:00.020 --> 01:03:04.580\nfor them now like how is there even a degree was that a continuum like now I'm more likely to vote\n\n01:03:04.580 --> 01:03:10.980\nfor one of two people the the where it's a binary decision between whether I'm in my mind whether\n\n01:03:10.980 --> 01:03:15.700\nI'm good or evil now I'm more likely to double down the most brilliant move would like talking\n\n01:03:15.700 --> 01:03:23.620\nabout playing chess was the robocall thing of like oh let's have a fake Jew from the Washington Post\n\n01:03:23.620 --> 01:03:32.820\ncalling in like murking around looking for more dirt on him just to sully the whole yeah media\n\n01:03:32.820 --> 01:03:37.060\nyou know just to like just to fan the flames of resentment I didn't hear about that it was a\n\n01:03:37.060 --> 01:03:43.940\nfake it was a false flag robocall it was a it was a robocall in Alabama a real robocall that\n\n01:03:43.940 --> 01:03:49.700\nwent out and it was you got to hear it it's it's amazing it's uh it's uh yeah this is uh it's a\n\n01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:55.540\nrecording you know it's like oh this is a Bernie Bernstein from the Washington Post and I'm looking\n\n01:03:55.540 --> 01:04:02.020\nfor some information about about what's his name about the fucking you know whoever I forgot the\n\n01:04:02.020 --> 01:04:07.780\nguy's name and they're like if you have any tips no questions ask I pay five thousand dollars call\n\n01:04:07.780 --> 01:04:15.380\nthis number blah blah blah like just so that just to muddy the water so that people are are confused\n\n01:04:15.380 --> 01:04:21.860\nabout whether or not that's real and whether or not the process of finding that information is\n\n01:04:21.860 --> 01:04:28.660\nand just to throw doubt on whether or not any of that information is real right right most people\n\n01:04:28.660 --> 01:04:34.020\nsaid things like I don't know about the timing yeah the timing's kind of weird yeah yeah it's\n\n01:04:34.020 --> 01:04:38.740\nweird that it would come up right now yeah yeah wait what do you mean the timing of finding out\n\n01:04:38.740 --> 01:04:43.940\nthat these allocate that these allegations from all these women from or from like 40 years ago\n\n01:04:43.940 --> 01:04:47.940\nand this guy's had a long career you know right so they're saying like why would it come up now\n\n01:04:47.940 --> 01:04:53.300\nthat seems weird to them uh and you know they're not taking into account that there could be\n\n01:04:53.300 --> 01:05:00.180\nthis movement going on where right and they feel empowered or emboldened to speak out and to speak\n\n01:05:00.180 --> 01:05:05.940\nup and they didn't before right yeah also the cover-up was 40 years well I didn't know it was\n\n01:05:05.940 --> 01:05:10.580\nunder that's so weird like it would be like yeah who gives a shit if it's politically motivated to\n\n01:05:10.580 --> 01:05:15.860\ncome forward right let's say well that's such a great excuse like oh it's politically it's\n\n01:05:15.860 --> 01:05:20.260\npolitically those are my political enemies like true yes they are your political enemies of course\n\n01:05:20.260 --> 01:05:28.020\nthat that's how that works the job that you want yeah and the audience is going crazy well\n\n01:05:28.020 --> 01:05:34.340\nyou know you gotta most people are just listening to this they're working out it's like a regular\n\n01:05:34.340 --> 01:05:40.100\npodcast they're at the gym yeah the subscribers get the treat of it's kind of like a Neil\n\n01:05:40.100 --> 01:05:45.380\nhamburger you kind of bit like like there's no audience so it feels like just awkward enough\n\n01:05:45.380 --> 01:05:48.900\nI didn't mean that the audience listening is going crazy I was joking about the\n\n01:05:48.900 --> 01:05:51.220\npeople the live audience here yeah yeah\n\n01:05:53.300 --> 01:06:00.180\nyou know I cardboard cutouts of people somebody did once suggest that we fill it with mannequins\n\n01:06:00.180 --> 01:06:02.340\nand then said that Dan would not be able to concentrate\n\n01:06:04.580 --> 01:06:05.460\nshout out to ready\n\n01:06:08.260 --> 01:06:12.660\nyeah I what it's that's another exciting thing about all this like you know allegations and\n\n01:06:12.660 --> 01:06:17.780\nall this stuff is like unless and I assume we're not going to start kink shaming right because\n\n01:06:17.780 --> 01:06:22.740\nespecially like if you're it's like I kind of like I never set out to be a hero by jerking\n\n01:06:22.740 --> 01:06:27.300\noff on a mannequin leg but because that's a victimless crime I'm kind of like an accidental\n\n01:06:27.300 --> 01:06:32.500\nlike that happened Arthur here like let's go and bring those six legs out for their testimony\n\n01:06:32.500 --> 01:06:37.140\nright now like I just happened to that's that's the other thing I want to be careful about that's\n\n01:06:37.140 --> 01:06:40.820\nwhy I've been like careful careful to let go like well let's talk about the silence and let's\n\n01:06:40.820 --> 01:06:43.780\nguys let's take account about the way we're treating women and all that stuff because\n\n01:06:43.780 --> 01:06:47.860\nI don't want because otherwise I'm in the catbird seat and I didn't want to be because I didn't\n\n01:06:47.860 --> 01:06:52.100\nshoot that's not by choice that's like that's no more by choice than if I was born like gay or\n\n01:06:52.100 --> 01:06:56.500\nsomething like that like my proclivities don't happen to involve like uh\n\n01:06:57.780 --> 01:07:04.660\nlike like living people yeah like well I mean but they I'm not you know but I mean I they do\n\n01:07:04.660 --> 01:07:09.460\nthey have my proclivities involved my living girlfriend Cody but but I I I just mean like I\n\n01:07:09.460 --> 01:07:17.220\ndon't like I it just a youtube video goes so far you know like it doesn't I never really I don't\n\n01:07:17.220 --> 01:07:23.540\nhave the biology I don't think that results in like being so frustrated with a woman for not letting\n\n01:07:23.540 --> 01:07:28.820\nyou assault her that you have to jerk off in a potted plant like while she watches just to\n\n01:07:28.820 --> 01:07:34.660\njust to get your life back but whenever anything that involves like coming craving and all that\n\n01:07:34.660 --> 01:07:42.340\nstuff I'm always like even though it's like really easy to vilify the the creepy people like I know\n\n01:07:42.340 --> 01:07:47.540\nlike I'm creepy you know like I'm just not I just don't happen to be creepy in a way that like\n\n01:07:47.540 --> 01:07:51.300\nwould ever bring me into an intersection where somebody else was getting hurt without their\n\n01:07:51.300 --> 01:07:56.180\nconsent but I I don't think that's I don't think that's because I'm a noble person I think that's\n\n01:07:56.180 --> 01:08:02.340\nbecause I like saw some pantyhose feet under the table when I was 10 years old in the 70s or something\n\n01:08:02.340 --> 01:08:11.220\nand like I don't so I it's so I'm like because I don't want it would be just like so easy to just\n\n01:08:11.220 --> 01:08:18.020\ngo like oh yeah let's let's let's let's find all the all the worst people and let's like let's get\n\n01:08:18.020 --> 01:08:25.140\nrid of them but it's not really it's like you can find monsters if you look for monsters like you'll\n\n01:08:25.140 --> 01:08:29.460\njust find them but I don't think that'll I think if you could wave a magic wand and get rid of every\n\n01:08:29.460 --> 01:08:33.620\nguy that ever heard a person I don't think that would solve the problem but also people are\n\n01:08:34.500 --> 01:08:42.260\ncomplex and no one is everyone has bad shit about them and and you know not everyone that is being\n\n01:08:43.220 --> 01:08:47.060\nI mean different yeah not to not to tie it back to what we were talking about but uh\n\n01:08:48.100 --> 01:08:52.260\nyou know all of those people are still going to be in society and living and like they were charged\n\n01:08:52.260 --> 01:08:58.820\nwith whatever sexual misconduct or sexual assault or like they have families and kids and they love\n\n01:08:58.820 --> 01:09:02.660\ntheir kids and you know they just people sometimes I'm not defending any of those people but I'm\n\n01:09:02.660 --> 01:09:10.100\nsaying that people are complicated and good people do bad things and so how do we deal with that you\n\n01:09:10.100 --> 01:09:16.900\nknow yeah we have to make this about like how do we how do we fix society not if we if we it'll be\n\n01:09:16.900 --> 01:09:22.820\nthe easy way out to make it into a okay got this one that one that one that one just some symbolic\n\n01:09:22.820 --> 01:09:29.380\nbullshit yeah because for for a couple reasons one is like just your classic scientific reason\n\n01:09:29.380 --> 01:09:35.460\nwhich is like the same reason your doctor tells you you got to finish these uh antibiotics you\n\n01:09:35.460 --> 01:09:39.620\ncan't just take them until you don't have the sniffles anymore and then throw them in the garbage\n\n01:09:39.620 --> 01:09:44.580\nyou got to keep taking them after you feel good because you're if you're if there's a couple left\n\n01:09:44.580 --> 01:09:51.380\nthey're just gonna be really good at being making you sick so the metaphor there is like do we really\n\n01:09:51.380 --> 01:09:58.260\nwant to just find the Weinsteins hang them from the highest tree and then what's left oh the\n\n01:09:59.460 --> 01:10:05.860\nthe super secret agent predators that like never get caught the Kevin Costner's in Mr Mr\n\n01:10:06.580 --> 01:10:13.940\nMr Pottery Lacker what's that movie

this\n\n01:12:17.860 --> 01:12:28.180\nis the story of MGM and Charles Manson I was wondering if you could all try and do\n\n01:12:28.740 --> 01:12:34.660\nmaybe a little bit of iraq laugh is Charles Manson about to die yes he already died\n\n01:12:34.660 --> 01:12:40.820\nit's close very close I hear people upset about that I seem upset I I the yeah the weird thing\n\n01:12:40.820 --> 01:12:48.580\nwill be does Charles Manson by virtue of our culture's well justified penchant for irony\n\n01:12:48.580 --> 01:12:56.260\nand and going lateral or or correcting as we go will Charles Manson get a worse or better\n\n01:12:56.260 --> 01:13:04.980\nViking funeral than Hugh Hefner like Hugh Hefner got fucking blasted like he he he lived 15 years\n\n01:13:04.980 --> 01:13:12.740\ntoo long like if he had died 15 years ago which so many people that knew him and and were in the\n\n01:13:12.740 --> 01:13:18.500\nsame room with him argue that he did that he would have just been your usual like you know he\n\n01:13:18.500 --> 01:13:24.740\nwould have gotten that eulogy to expect of like I was an iconoclast and a and a rebel\n\n01:13:24.740 --> 01:13:30.180\nmillionaire that changed the culture blah blah blah it's like he just he hung on so long that he\n\n01:13:30.180 --> 01:13:37.860\ngot to see like oh yeah see you later you fucking monster yeah I like wow hadn't he sold the mansion\n\n01:13:37.860 --> 01:13:47.380\nbut was still living in the man he put the mansion up for sale with the odd caveat on the price tag\n\n01:13:47.380 --> 01:13:53.140\nthat you that he was allowed to live there till he died small contingency yeah and now the guy\n\n01:13:53.140 --> 01:13:58.660\nsaid he's gonna reunite both properties because it used to be one huge super mansion oh really\n\n01:13:58.660 --> 01:14:03.380\nnot crazy I've never been there it seems to me like it would be a bummer of it like to like\n\n01:14:03.380 --> 01:14:07.060\nit's above their parties out there and it's gonna be the playboy mansion I'm always like\n\n01:14:07.060 --> 01:14:14.020\nthat's fucking bummer it was a bummer yeah it was a bummer I was there once yeah it and I think it\n\n01:14:14.020 --> 01:14:20.900\nonly smelled like mildew because it was raining and so they did something they don't normally have\n\n01:14:20.900 --> 01:14:26.660\nto do which is they because it was an outdoor on the lawn part at courtyard party or something and\n\n01:14:26.660 --> 01:14:35.060\nthey had to unroll 10 awnings that I think just only they just rolled up since the last time it\n\n01:14:35.060 --> 01:14:39.780\nrained and so the whole place smelled like your grandpa's sleeping bag yeah yeah and the buffet\n\n01:14:39.780 --> 01:14:48.260\nwas sort of weird looking sad kind of like bad hoteli did you get that uh yeah I mean but yeah\n\n01:14:48.260 --> 01:14:56.820\nMarlago more uh princess cruise lines just dark dark that's where my famous David Hasselhoff\n\n01:14:56.820 --> 01:15:01.540\nstory takes place me and Schrab where we we harassed David Hasselhoff at the playboy mansion\n\n01:15:01.540 --> 01:15:07.700\nhilarious and uh yeah we walked up to him and and said we were just we were just high off our\n\n01:15:07.700 --> 01:15:15.380\nasses like and and we're like we have to talk to David Hasselhoff and we go uh hey uh we made\n\n01:15:15.380 --> 01:15:20.180\nwe made a pilot it's about you it's inspired by you and he's like you made a pilot about me\n\n01:15:20.980 --> 01:15:24.500\nand we're talking about Heat Vision and Jack or like yeah I was directed by Ben Stiller and\n\n01:15:24.500 --> 01:15:28.420\nit was about it was it was called heatfishing a jack and it was kind of it's very inspired by\n\n01:15:28.420 --> 01:15:33.620\nby nightrider and so on and he's like Ben Stiller what else did he direct and and and\n\n01:15:33.620 --> 01:15:41.940\nand Schrab said uh Zoolander why that was from the I and and and then and then David Hasselhoff\n\n01:15:41.940 --> 01:15:48.660\njust like processing all of this like Cox's Hasselhead and then goes Zoolander's about me\n\n01:15:49.540 --> 01:15:56.260\nand then Schrab and I just like we're at his beat and we both went yes and then just walked away\n\n01:15:56.260 --> 01:16:01.940\nthat's awesome I'm sure he might still think that yeah I mean that's where we're like we're like\n\n01:16:01.940 --> 01:16:05.620\ncracking up like we weren't trying to like punk him but we were just like we were too high to be\n\n01:16:05.620 --> 01:16:10.020\ntalking to anybody much less we did a bad job so at least we turned that into a story and now\n\n01:16:10.020 --> 01:16:14.660\nthe only the only real victim of this story is going to be a David Hasselhoff's lawyer\n\n01:16:14.660 --> 01:16:19.540\nbecause you know that guy got a 3am phone call like I want you to like look into the Zoolander\n\n01:16:20.180 --> 01:16:27.140\nmore like Zoolander because I'm hearing that movie is about me. Hasselhoff like at every party\n\n01:16:27.140 --> 01:16:33.540\nhas to endure like so many you know so many people like just stone like we have to talk to Hassel\n\n01:16:33.540 --> 01:16:39.460\nliterally it's just a barrage of people like and and and fortunately for him um he's so hard to find\n\n01:16:39.460 --> 01:16:44.980\nin a crowd because he's only seven foot zero is he really he's so tall I mean it's like like Tim\n\n01:16:44.980 --> 01:16:49.620\nRobbins John Cousack David Hasselhoff they're like in a in an industry where everyone's shocked to\n\n01:16:49.620 --> 01:16:55.540\nfind out that everyone's five foot three yeah like you and I are tall guys could get a relative to\n\n01:16:55.540 --> 01:17:01.700\nthese like these tiny little fucking Kebler yeah tall

what are you plugging and may I\n\n01:17:17.940 --> 01:17:23.540\ncongratulate you on your choice of venue to plug it oh yeah I mean I'm not plugging that hard\n\n01:17:23.540 --> 01:17:31.220\nyeah we made this show for YouTube red which is like a their new pay thing but uh but yeah it just\n\n01:17:31.220 --> 01:17:35.380\ncame out it's called do you want to see a dead body oh yeah okay I heard I heard you talking about\n\n01:17:35.380 --> 01:17:42.180\nthis on um uh on uh god damn it how did this get made yeah yeah and so it's basically we I used to\n\n01:17:42.180 --> 01:17:49.140\ndo this bit on Funny or Die and we just expanded that into like a larger TV world where uh yeah I\n\n01:17:49.140 --> 01:17:55.380\njust take different comedians out to go find a fucking dead body somewhere is it is is it's sort\n\n01:17:55.380 --> 01:18:03.300\nof like are you accomplishing even ironically uh a like uh interview no you're going no that was\n\n01:18:03.300 --> 01:18:07.860\nwhat we thought about that was going to be the that was like our original idea was like oh it'll\n\n01:18:07.860 --> 01:18:14.740\nbe like a talk show and I'll talk to them but uh no it's fully scripted so I play me and they play\n\n01:18:14.740 --> 01:18:20.100\nyou know a weirdo version of them but it's always like it's very little about the body\n\n01:18:20.100 --> 01:18:25.060\nof you have you met our new running character uh tiny brandon\n\n01:18:35.220 --> 01:18:38.020\ndid you think that no one was going to notice you like\n\n01:18:41.780 --> 01:18:45.540\ntiny brandon wait tiny brandon can you can you stick around a little while just\n\n01:18:45.540 --> 01:18:53.700\nokay um uh what I don't you were talking about the show about dead bodies\n\n01:18:56.340 --> 01:19:04.260\ntiny brandon uh do you uh are you worried about america you know I open up for Kevin Hart\n\n01:19:05.380 --> 01:19:12.260\nand well we're on tour I see a lot of different faces all so big I thought tiny brandon was a\n\n01:19:12.260 --> 01:19:17.860\nchild I think he's he's he's an adult but he's mentally handicapped yeah I when I first saw him\n\n01:19:17.860 --> 01:19:22.900\nI thought it was like part of the Harmon babies uh thing we're launching where it's like all of us\n\n01:19:22.900 --> 01:19:30.100\nthat are like but younger but no I think he's yeah I think he's yeah he's he's he's he's 48 and he's\n\n01:19:30.100 --> 01:19:47.380\nfucked up like there was a fuck up at the hospital okay thank you tiny brandon we won't\n\n01:19:47.380 --> 01:19:52.980\nkeep you tiny brandon uh someone should make a t-shirt with tiny brandon someone someone'll\n\n01:19:52.980 --> 01:19:58.820\ndo something like we've got some very talented fans what I miss hubel show hubel's talking about\n\n01:19:58.820 --> 01:20:03.940\na show that's what I mean uh yeah but so it's basically just an excuse uh for me to hang out\n\n01:20:03.940 --> 01:20:09.860\nwith that person but uh it's not like a reality show uh you know it's a scripted thing so supposedly\n\n01:20:11.300 --> 01:20:16.420\nfamous people will drop whatever they're doing and come with me to go find a different dead body\n\n01:20:16.420 --> 01:20:21.300\nevery episode so not all famous people because obviously like I I wasn't called uh no there was\n\n01:20:21.300 --> 01:20:25.620\nno way to to use every famous person in hollywood there's also so many famous people nowadays there's\n\n01:20:25.620 --> 01:20:31.540\nso many famous people um and I put famous in quotes but uh do you find a body sometimes we do\n\n01:20:31.540 --> 01:20:38.020\nsometimes we don't find a body sometimes the guest uh become like uh there's one with john\n\n01:20:38.020 --> 01:20:43.540\nshow that starts out in five seconds into it he falls into a thing a quicksand and so the whole\n\n01:20:43.540 --> 01:20:50.180\nepisode is me I run into town to buy some rope and then I just keep getting distracted and you\n\n01:20:50.180 --> 01:20:54.660\nknow getting getting you know harangued into something else and then I keep coming back to\n\n01:20:54.660 --> 01:20:58.500\nhim to give him an update and every time he's like lower and lower in the quicksand so then he becomes\n\n01:20:58.500 --> 01:21:03.940\nthe body you know that's awesome so but uh and then there's like one with cordry where cordry\n\n01:21:03.940 --> 01:21:08.100\nstarts taunting this big dog and someone's we're cutting through someone's backyard there's this\n\n01:21:08.100 --> 01:21:12.260\nbig fucking mean dog and cordry starts like taunting it of course the dog breaks off his\n\n01:21:12.260 --> 01:21:18.500\nchain and the whole episode is us running full speed away from this murdering like very scary dog\n\n01:21:18.500 --> 01:21:24.100\nand uh so it's just dumb bits like that you know they're 15 minutes long super super easy\n\n01:21:24.100 --> 01:21:28.260\nand silly and it's like my favorite favorite thing I know this is a dumb question and I\n\n01:21:28.260 --> 01:21:34.100\nhave a show with youtube red so I get asked this question and have no idea how to answer it but\n\n01:21:34.100 --> 01:21:38.820\nwhat the fuck yeah maybe other people know how to answer it maybe that's why they ask what what's\n\n01:21:38.820 --> 01:21:45.300\nit what was it like to work with me to read um I tell I've told everybody it's been really great\n\n01:21:45.300 --> 01:21:51.220\nuh because they let me do literally anything like literally anything they were just like\n\n01:21:51.780 --> 01:21:56.020\nsuper psych you know I think they're just kind of getting going with a lot of their shows and\n\n01:21:56.020 --> 01:21:59.780\ntrying to get more people to come and do shows there so you know I think at the beginning\n\n01:22:00.900 --> 01:22:05.700\nyou know like Netflix and amazon when they first started they're like how do we how do we get good\n\n01:22:05.700 --> 01:22:11.300\npeople to come make shows here oh we don't fuck with them right so that was my experience um they\n\n01:22:11.300 --> 01:22:19.460\nwere super cool to me um you know I I wish that they would run fucking commercials like on tv\n\n01:22:19.460 --> 01:22:23.380\nfor it and stuff like that and but they're like no no no we're youtube we're gonna put it like all\n\n01:22:23.380 --> 01:22:27.380\naround youtube and I'm like oh okay well then I'll leave that to you guys you know I think they're\n\n01:22:27.380 --> 01:22:34.500\nmaking I I I'm very dubious about one but this also might not be an actual uh thing that they're\n\n01:22:34.500 --> 01:22:38.900\ndoing this may be how they explain what they're doing to people they have no intention of bringing\n\n01:22:38.900 --> 01:22:46.980\nback for a second season but it it what I'm hearing through the grapevine is that their methodology is\n\n01:22:46.980 --> 01:22:56.660\nlike they're gonna they're just waiting to see how many people subscribe and then of that of that\n\n01:22:56.660 --> 01:23:02.660\ngroup of people that subscribe like how many of them based on the behaviors that are very\n\n01:23:02.660 --> 01:23:08.820\nmonitorable from youtube's cockpit like how many of them subscribed for your show and how many of the\n\n01:23:08.820 --> 01:23:14.100\nlike very very meticulous intricate very valuable data but there's this kind of aspect to it where\n\n01:23:14.100 --> 01:23:21.460\nit's like they're not it it they're waiting to get the entire picture yeah yeah and I feel like\n\n01:23:21.460 --> 01:23:26.500\nscary about that all that stuff is so measurable now you know like like netflix they can tell\n\n01:23:27.700 --> 01:23:31.860\nwhat you watch how long you watch it did you watch the whole thing did you know did you not\n\n01:23:31.860 --> 01:23:37.780\nwatch it you know what else you watch that's like that so that sort of stuff is scary and that like\n\n01:23:38.660 --> 01:23:42.900\nbecause you know none of those places have ratings but they have even more specific data you know\n\n01:23:42.900 --> 01:23:48.660\nwhich is but I would have liked because it's your show it makes more sense just the title\n\n01:23:48.660 --> 01:23:56.340\nmakes more sense the premise makes more sense my show was uh it ended up being community but if\n\n01:23:56.340 --> 01:24:02.740\nwhat if esports you know it was and it was like kind of like oh this could be a real tv show\n\n01:24:02.740 --> 01:24:07.620\nand if I had known what the business plan was going to be in terms of like how you got a pickup\n\n01:24:07.620 --> 01:24:13.220\nyeah I would have called my show for instance do you want to see a dead body like literally because\n\n01:24:13.220 --> 01:24:20.420\nthat's like the most brilliant because it's like it just I would have leaned into some kind of hook\n\n01:24:20.420 --> 01:24:28.500\nor I would have called it like fuck fuck yeah you know like oh fuck cool cool dicks but there\n\n01:24:28.500 --> 01:24:35.780\nwas a lot of talk of like tv 14 yeah yeah yeah this is that it was like it was like well that\n\n01:24:35.780 --> 01:24:41.780\nsounds weird because you like like that's not amazon that's not netflix that's those other\n\n01:24:41.780 --> 01:24:45.460\ncompanies were just like yeah it is true that those companies are like well we don't really\n\n01:24:45.460 --> 01:24:50.180\nknow what we're doing so let's just start doing it yeah who wants 10 episodes okay this person\n\n01:24:50.180 --> 01:24:56.660\nworked in tv this person worked on tv and that that I'm worried about this model like dying on\n\n01:24:56.660 --> 01:25:01.300\nthe vine a little bit like but but that again they're youtube so they get all the money in the\n\n01:25:01.300 --> 01:25:06.180\nworld they can do it once wrong and then shake it off and do it and then be even better than\n\n01:25:06.180 --> 01:25:11.300\neverybody well they're definitely figuring aspects of it out I think like because I was worried about\n\n01:25:11.300 --> 01:25:17.380\nthat too um like the tv 14 type approach because I didn't want to do that I don't want to like make a\n\n01:25:17.380 --> 01:25:22.660\nshow that's appropriate or palatable for like little kids like I don't really care like all\n\n01:25:22.660 --> 01:25:29.700\nI really wanted to do is make a super fucked up funny show with our friends you know and like I\n\n01:25:29.700 --> 01:25:34.900\nknew that if we did that then that's all I can control like I can't control any of the other\n\n01:25:34.900 --> 01:25:41.140\nbullshit of the marketing and you know who subscribes to it and how many people blah blah\n\n01:25:41.140 --> 01:25:47.620\nso um yeah I try to approach things as I'm sure you do it's just like someone gave us some money\n\n01:25:47.620 --> 01:25:51.860\nto make this let's make this thing as cool as we can and then maybe we'll get to make more who\n\n01:25:51.860 --> 01:25:56.660\nknows if we don't I should have approached it more like that but then again that's not how tv that's\n\n01:25:56.660 --> 01:26:02.500\nnot how this project got developed like uh people came in that like we're excited about the e-sports\n\n01:26:02.500 --> 01:26:09.220\nthing and it had an exciting take on it yeah we took it wide youtube red ended up expressing\n\n01:26:09.220 --> 01:26:18.020\nthe most interest in it so that whole process is kind of like incompatible with the idea of\n\n01:26:18.020 --> 01:26:25.460\nand then we'll see if anyone wants to subscribe based on zero uh promotion and what they click on\n\n01:26:25.460 --> 01:26:30.980\nand how long they click on it like again I would have called my show pussyfoot yeah like it would\n\n01:26:30.980 --> 01:26:37.060\nhave been the adventures of of pussyfoot new and the the sub sub headline would have been like\n\n01:26:37.060 --> 01:26:42.180\ncould a pussy be a shoe like like like something or like I would have called it mixed nibblitz\n\n01:26:43.220 --> 01:26:49.060\ncolon the pussy shoe diaries anything that would like be trendable and like clickable and like\n\n01:26:49.620 --> 01:26:54.500\nand and would have had like a gorilla feel to it too yeah I wouldn't have tried to make cheers\n\n01:26:54.500 --> 01:26:58.580\nthat doesn't make any sense if you don't know cheers exist and frankly if you aren't being told by\n\n01:26:58.580 --> 01:27:03.780\npeople magazine that cheers is worth watching you're not gonna watch it yeah yeah uh so I don't know\n\n01:27:03.780 --> 01:27:11.940\nuh I think we did it wrong well it's it's tricky for sure and and and our show just came out on\n\n01:27:11.940 --> 01:27:18.020\nFriday so I don't know I mean I will say this too about the the name of the show has not been an\n\n01:27:18.020 --> 01:27:24.420\neasy name in the current country that we live in because like you know we were gonna put the show\n\n01:27:24.420 --> 01:27:30.340\nout last month and then the las vegas shooting happened and youtube was like no no no no no no\n\n01:27:30.340 --> 01:27:34.340\nno no yeah don't put it in they were like you know let's let's move in I was like yes absolutely\n\n01:27:34.340 --> 01:27:39.140\nand then at a certain point you guys just do a little bit of ADR and change the name to the show\n\n01:27:39.140 --> 01:27:44.820\nis would you like to avoid seeing a dead body at all costs and then it's like I hate yeah yeah\n\n01:27:44.820 --> 01:27:48.420\nbut I mean the only thing you can click on to guarantee you don't see one yeah there's like\n\n01:27:48.420 --> 01:27:52.900\none coming around the corner oh god yeah I mean like you know I've just told people like in press\n\n01:27:52.900 --> 01:27:57.940\nand stuff like you know this is not me killing people there's no violence in the show it's just\n\n01:27:57.940 --> 01:28:02.580\na fucked up treasure hunt you know it's like me it's like stand by me you know it's like but\n\n01:28:02.580 --> 01:28:07.860\njust with like funny adults that's really so but it's still like the name of it scared them a lot\n\n01:28:07.860 --> 01:28:12.020\nI think it's you know just as far as shit that keeps happening you know like they're like oh yeah\n\n01:28:12.020 --> 01:28:15.860\nwe can't put it out now there was just you know yeah well let's wait until let's wait until these\n\n01:28:15.860 --> 01:28:22.580\nmass shootings cool down yeah or until or until death death goes away until until until until\n\n01:28:22.580 --> 01:28:30.180\nabsolute oh like 100% saturation to the point where no one could possibly be offended because\n\n01:28:30.180 --> 01:28:36.260\nit would be like if your show was called who wants to breathe oxygen yeah because there's just dead\n\n01:28:36.260 --> 01:28:43.460\nbodies everywhere but but you know what's funny about this in like a weird like a magnolia ish\n\n01:28:43.460 --> 01:28:51.700\nway is I'm just remembering it not to make us feel old but it's got to be almost 20 years ago\n\n01:28:51.700 --> 01:29:03.300\nnow when the human giant was on MTV and I had a sketch show on VH1 and the Virginia Tech massacre\n\n01:29:03.300 --> 01:29:10.420\nhappened yeah and um and it was like I think Columbine happened before that right Columbine\n\n01:29:10.420 --> 01:29:16.340\nwas before Virginia Tech but Virginia Tech was then like uh it was it was taken very seriously\n\n01:29:16.340 --> 01:29:21.940\num I didn't mean to say that in an eye-rolling way I'm just like saying with all of us it's like\n\n01:29:21.940 --> 01:29:26.820\nJesus Christ somebody send those people a message um about how serious to take death\n\n01:29:28.260 --> 01:29:36.340\nthe but the craziest I was watching MTV I was watching your guy's show and that sketch uh\n\n01:29:36.900 --> 01:29:44.500\nblood blood packed blood oath yeah yeah it's a sketch uh sketch on the human giant show\n\n01:29:44.500 --> 01:29:51.060\nthe the guys are trying to decide where to where to eat lunch um during their business lunch and\n\n01:29:51.060 --> 01:29:57.860\nthey take a blood oath to yeah we decide to go to a barbecue place but just in order to guarantee\n\n01:29:57.860 --> 01:30:02.740\nthat no one will change their minds we go into like the storeroom of the store we work in like a\n\n01:30:02.740 --> 01:30:08.020\nfucking little tiny little video game store we're like okay well let's just just so we're on the\n\n01:30:08.020 --> 01:30:12.020\nsame page like let's go take a blood oath you know so that no one changes where we're going today\n\n01:30:12.020 --> 01:30:16.500\nyou know so we go in the back and there's just this fucking ritual where we all slice up in our\n\n01:30:16.500 --> 01:30:22.580\nhand and it becomes really gruesome and like when we drink blood it becomes like a bananas\n\n01:30:22.580 --> 01:30:27.540\nmaybe I mentioned this the last time you were you were were you and sheer on the show together\n\n01:30:27.540 --> 01:30:31.300\nand on this show together maybe I last time yeah yeah and I did I did I bring this up I don't think\n\n01:30:31.300 --> 01:30:40.020\nso but yeah so I'm watching that sketch and and the other thing is that also at the time\n\n01:30:40.020 --> 01:30:47.780\nmy my sketch show on vh1 like there was this cold open we wanted to do where there was a sniper\n\n01:30:47.780 --> 01:30:53.380\nin the in the show or something there was like kind of an old sc tv style thing where it was just\n\n01:30:53.380 --> 01:30:56.900\nlike we would just have different gimmicks for our wrap around yeah like we wanted to just have\n\n01:30:56.900 --> 01:31:03.300\nthere was a sniper loose as a cinematic trope now you can't pitch that without you you would think\n\n01:31:03.300 --> 01:31:09.060\nlike oh you're doing a mass shooting jug it's like no snipers weren't that topical yeah yeah\n\n01:31:09.060 --> 01:31:16.020\nthey were a cinematic trope yeah um and uh and and so it started we when we wrote it it was that\n\n01:31:16.020 --> 01:31:22.500\nand then Virginia Tech happened and then the word came down from vh1 um which is the same company\n\n01:31:23.140 --> 01:31:28.660\nViacom yeah uh it's saying like no don't can't do this don't do that sniper sketch and then you\n\n01:31:28.660 --> 01:31:34.900\nturned on the tv and saw well I turn well here's what I saw and I still and I was like I thought\n\n01:31:34.900 --> 01:31:41.540\nI was watching it and then so that sketches they take the blood oath so then it just goes insane\n\n01:31:41.540 --> 01:31:45.620\nand it's like they're rubbing blood on each other's nipples and they're just like drinking blood\n\n01:31:45.620 --> 01:31:50.260\nand it's going insane and it turns into this like satanic thing and there's just blood everywhere\n\n01:31:50.820 --> 01:31:59.540\nand in the middle of it um just quietly and unceremoniously this giant lower third bug comes\n\n01:31:59.540 --> 01:32:11.220\nup and it says uh MTV uh uh supports the families of the victims of the Virginia Tech massacre\n\n01:32:11.220 --> 01:32:17.700\nare you serious uh it and it just stayed there during that sketch like just coincidentally\n\n01:32:17.700 --> 01:32:23.060\nor they I didn't think it was a coincidence because of the note I got from vh1 I was like oh they\n\n01:32:23.060 --> 01:32:28.500\nand I I parsed it in two I was like oh because we're not human giant we uh like we gotta get\n\n01:32:28.500 --> 01:32:32.500\nour thing killed but it was but then I thought well be reasonable Dan they already shot this\n\n01:32:32.500 --> 01:32:40.500\nit's airing and um they killed your script uh but this couldn't be killed so they brought\n\n01:32:40.500 --> 01:32:46.340\nthis bug up over and that's amazing I but I don't but then I talked to people about it later and\n\n01:32:46.340 --> 01:32:50.420\nexplain that story and so I don't know it could have been you even said like no that was that had\n\n01:32:50.420 --> 01:32:57.700\nto be coincidence just sheer coincidence but it looked like they I don't yeah that would be I don't\n\n01:32:57.700 --> 01:33:05.060\nthink that they are organized enough to like go through their shows and know that there's a really\n\n01:33:05.060 --> 01:33:11.860\nviolent bloody sketch airing tonight we should put a we should put a a condolence message there but\n\n01:33:11.860 --> 01:33:17.780\nthat is perfect timing and also I don't know it sounds like something Viacom would do to\n\n01:33:18.900 --> 01:33:22.660\nthis is this is really perfect way of dealing with it because then the families of the victims\n\n01:33:22.660 --> 01:33:26.260\nwould be so relieved oh yeah they'd be watching the sketch they'd be watching the sketch well\n\n01:33:26.260 --> 01:33:30.900\nit wasn't there blood everywhere when my brother got killed and so I'm feeling bad I think I should\n\n01:33:30.900 --> 01:33:36.580\nstart flipping the channel honey wait wait look there's a message we love you oh we love you\n\n01:33:36.580 --> 01:33:44.500\nDonald um fuck if they're gonna put that lower third I'm cool with it I'm cool with this sketch\n\n01:33:44.500 --> 01:33:52.740\nI think we killed Charles Manson did he just die he died at 816 is that true yeah did we kill him\n\n01:33:52.740 --> 01:33:58.500\nwith our words I think right at the time that we were talking about him dying he died we said\n\n01:33:58.500 --> 01:34:06.100\ntrue we said Manson the third time and he his his juice wow yeah I don't want to become famous for\n\n01:34:06.100 --> 01:34:11.860\nthat maybe we were the Manson killer but something something tells me it was gonna happen wow yeah\n\n01:34:12.660 --> 01:34:18.500\nso just uh is there any like what was it like just old age just uh I gotta I gotta go guys I'm\n\n01:34:18.500 --> 01:34:23.380\nso sorry I'm so upset about this it's just like he was a cool guy nobody wants to be drunk right\n\n01:34:23.380 --> 01:34:27.700\nnow no no no he was just stay away I mean I gotta go I gotta go we should pour some more drinks we\n\n01:34:27.700 --> 01:34:33.700\nshould pour some more drinks deal with this I am so sad he I heard he he he hung himself in his cell\n\n01:34:33.700 --> 01:34:41.540\nand his note said he's like look I know what's coming there's a lot of allegations yeah he didn't\n\n01:34:41.540 --> 01:34:46.340\nfucked up stuff people might be talking about this he's like yeah I don't you know this is gonna ruin\n\n01:34:46.340 --> 01:34:56.900\nme yeah Manson out I sexually assaulted Leslie van houten let's just say I did not run an equitable\n\n01:34:56.900 --> 01:35:03.860\nranch there will be allegations I don't know why he didn't get killed in the first place while there\n\n01:35:03.860 --> 01:35:08.740\nwasn't a death penalty well because he I mean this is gonna sound I know how this is gonna make me sound\n\n01:35:08.740 --> 01:35:13.780\nand maybe never but I was just about to go like well because he barely did anything yeah yeah but\n\n01:35:13.780 --> 01:35:18.740\nthat is the thing like I that's a 20 year old fetish I have not for Manson but just for like\n\n01:35:18.740 --> 01:35:24.420\nexceptionalism like like I I just get mad or I used to get mad I think there's some residual\n\n01:35:24.420 --> 01:35:29.940\nshit there where I would I just get mad about like how hypocritical we are about our treatment of\n\n01:35:29.940 --> 01:35:36.180\nprisoners murderers whatever like like he killed I think he killed a couple people here and there\n\n01:35:36.180 --> 01:35:43.300\nbecause he was a scumbag but he was in prison for his entire life because he had more influence\n\n01:35:43.300 --> 01:35:49.700\nover kids than the government yeah and I just always is like this is horse shit like like like\n\n01:35:49.700 --> 01:35:54.740\nI'm not that you should he should be out in the street but then again also like like like come on\n\n01:35:54.740 --> 01:36:02.740\nlike it like pick a lane society are you do you respect this guy or do you like like like like\n\n01:36:02.740 --> 01:36:06.100\nI don't know man I remember seeing I've talked about on this podcast where I was like\n\n01:36:06.100 --> 01:36:13.380\nlike where I saw like this this like inside the prison where he was and there was like this like\n\n01:36:13.380 --> 01:36:18.660\nsecurity guard going like giving a tour of his cell and saying and like showing all the stuff\n\n01:36:18.660 --> 01:36:23.700\nthat he was making like these art project like he'd made like a tarantula out of sock threads\n\n01:36:23.700 --> 01:36:28.900\nand it was like really looked like a tarantula sounds badass this is a good night to to to\n\n01:36:28.900 --> 01:36:35.620\ndoff of the cap to Charles Manson's arts and crafts and and and he he like the prison guard\n\n01:36:36.980 --> 01:36:42.020\nkept picking up the stuff looks like he made a tarantula photo realistic tarantula out of\n\n01:36:42.020 --> 01:36:45.860\nsock threads you know again he's not supposed to be doing this because he doesn't have his arts and\n\n01:36:45.860 --> 01:36:52.820\ncrafts card he lost it in February and I remember watching it going like where's your fucking card\n\n01:36:52.820 --> 01:36:58.900\nfor anything you screw and I was like as my girlfriend who was like a huge Roman Polanski\n\n01:36:58.900 --> 01:37:06.500\nfan and who blames Roman Polanski's entire weekend shall we say she she just claims she blames I\n\n01:37:06.500 --> 01:37:12.180\nthat was my first fight with that girlfriend and I found out like she's like why why don't you\n\n01:37:12.180 --> 01:37:15.460\nmarry Charles Manson I was like what the fuck do you care what are you and she's like because\n\n01:37:15.460 --> 01:37:19.860\nyou ruined Roman Polanski's life and it was like it was one of those like fights with a girlfriend\n\n01:37:19.860 --> 01:37:23.540\nwhere you actually kind of fall in love like like during the fight because you're like wow you're\n\n01:37:24.180 --> 01:37:33.220\nyou're fucked up too like you you you really love Roman Polanski anyways so he died just being\n\n01:37:33.220 --> 01:37:39.540\nan old dude I'm pretty sure it's just being an old dude so wait refresh my memory so he so he\n\n01:37:39.540 --> 01:37:45.140\nso he he just told people to kill people I mean yeah he was definitely guilty of murders throughout\n\n01:37:45.140 --> 01:37:51.620\nhis life but I think all of the murders that he actually committed himself he he was paid up on\n\n01:37:51.620 --> 01:37:56.020\nthose because our society does let you murder some people and like serve a couple years in\n\n01:37:56.020 --> 01:38:00.980\nprison and he did do that and then but the real reason he was in prison is because he was like\n\n01:38:00.980 --> 01:38:05.940\na cult leader that that inspired people to go out and kill a bunch of people yeah and I always found\n\n01:38:05.940 --> 01:38:14.260\nthat a little I just now I'm 44 now he's dead I don't care I'm not an iconoclast anymore I want\n\n01:38:14.260 --> 01:38:21.220\nmy old Obama society back I

for adult swim that you've been a\n\n01:47:38.420 --> 01:47:42.660\nproducer is that something that you I know you're the best at bringing it back to me no this is the\n\n01:47:42.660 --> 01:47:46.260\nbut I don't want to ruin it by saying it but this is the perfect fucking show format it's like\n\n01:47:46.260 --> 01:47:55.060\njust fucking that's my dream is just you like you like producing is it do you lean towards\n\n01:47:55.060 --> 01:48:01.620\nproducing more than performing um I don't love doing that because it's hard yeah I don't like\n\n01:48:02.340 --> 01:48:08.500\nI tell you what I like I like it I'm as lazy as the next person I like it when you can show up\n\n01:48:08.500 --> 01:48:16.020\nand uh and they wrote a really funny script and you do that script and if and if there's time\n\n01:48:16.020 --> 01:48:20.500\nthey're like in and improvise and also make it if you want to throw in your own jokes like I love\n\n01:48:20.500 --> 01:48:27.860\nthat but um more and more it that doesn't happen very so I feel like I write stuff out of necessity\n\n01:48:27.860 --> 01:48:32.980\nlike for for myself and that's not a sustainable life right like an actor's life I don't think that\n\n01:48:32.980 --> 01:48:41.140\nit really caught off guard like it's like next to NFL player in how how well you're treated\n\n01:48:41.140 --> 01:48:47.220\nfor a very short time and then you can be and then you are you are your phone does not ring yeah\n\n01:48:47.220 --> 01:48:52.900\nI just didn't ever want to be one of uh you know you you know you want to be able to control\n\n01:48:52.900 --> 01:48:59.620\nthings as much as you can and um and and I you know I I'm not a good writer I don't think I'm a\n\n01:48:59.620 --> 01:49:06.980\ngood writer but I uh it's fucking really hard or I have a hard time writing you probably just\n\n01:49:06.980 --> 01:49:12.820\nfucking pound it out and it's genius but like I fucking sit there and like just sweat it out it's\n\n01:49:12.820 --> 01:49:17.780\nso hard but uh I just you know is that the hardest part what's that is that the hardest part or is\n\n01:49:17.780 --> 01:49:23.540\nthe writing or is it harder to manage because the manager yeah yeah the managing of the thing\n\n01:49:23.540 --> 01:49:28.980\nI've had help with because uh like for dead body and stuff I did that with the guys from Children's\n\n01:49:28.980 --> 01:49:33.620\nHospital with Abominable and so they help with all that and funnier die so I've had a lot of\n\n01:49:33.620 --> 01:49:38.980\nsupport with I don't know how to fucking hire crews and do a budget for a show like I I sort of\n\n01:49:38.980 --> 01:49:45.700\nhire someone to do that for me um but the actual like you know you but but so I try to focus on\n\n01:49:45.700 --> 01:49:50.740\nlike the writing and then like getting the right mix of actors to help us out other comedy people\n\n01:49:50.740 --> 01:49:56.900\nto help us out so I like all that but but to your to your point I do that out of necessity\n\n01:49:56.900 --> 01:50:04.100\nbecause like to just be like a guy that's popping up every now and then on tv shows and movies like\n\n01:50:04.100 --> 01:50:08.020\nthat you can't I don't know how you would can do that anymore like I think you have to have like\n\n01:50:08.660 --> 01:50:12.900\nyou know I would just have to panic the whole time yeah you have to be creating stuff you know\n\n01:50:12.900 --> 01:50:17.380\nyou have to uh because even if you're successful I think that those psychological of not controlling\n\n01:50:17.380 --> 01:50:22.500\nyour own destiny is still a mind fucker which makes me admire actors because they I mean it's to be\n\n01:50:22.500 --> 01:50:29.140\nable to suppress that anxiety and not like succumb to that completely insane yeah but I I do get\n\n01:50:29.140 --> 01:50:35.220\nvery jealous of people that um that just fucking show you know they just like oh and then I was on\n\n01:50:35.780 --> 01:50:41.300\nthis show and then I would did this huge movie and now I'm I'm fucking set you know it's like\n\n01:50:41.940 --> 01:50:47.380\nI just haven't had that and like yeah you know um but more power to you if like that's yeah\n\n01:50:47.380 --> 01:50:56.020\nyeah if you can be a guy for hire yeah but what is the goal the goal because I I I've been a fool I\n\n01:50:56.020 --> 01:51:00.340\nthink or have I maybe I'm nailing it I don't know because I just feel like I've spent so long in\n\n01:51:00.340 --> 01:51:08.820\nsuch a panic and I've backed into well it's like it's like there's this fundamental layer of like\n\n01:51:08.820 --> 01:51:16.020\nwell you gotta not be homeless you gotta not end up fucked up like like like you gotta end up not\n\n01:51:16.020 --> 01:51:22.100\nstupid like like that you you didn't see this trend or that trend coming or the you know you didn't\n\n01:51:22.100 --> 01:51:28.420\nsee your own obsolescence you didn't you gotta it's it's I just have this very Wisconsin like\n\n01:51:28.420 --> 01:51:33.780\njust terror in me that I don't even think about it's just there it's just the foundation of my life\n\n01:51:33.780 --> 01:51:40.100\nit's like you gotta retire which is so funny because it's like I'm not yeah I have no desire to\n\n01:51:40.100 --> 01:51:47.940\nlike I do like I would fucking I like not knowing the answer to that question is called freedom\n\n01:51:49.780 --> 01:51:58.020\nall you have to do is find a million dollars under a rock and then I yeah I do Rick and Morty\n\n01:51:58.020 --> 01:52:07.620\nI do stuff for fun like I I oh no come back come back well I was just thinking I was just\n\n01:52:07.620 --> 01:52:11.620\nthinking about the fact that I'm yeah I'm just so wrong about everything because I always I do all\n\n01:52:11.620 --> 01:52:20.100\nthis shit you know and it probably like it's like Rick and Morty comes from such joy so easy\n\n01:52:20.100 --> 01:52:25.220\nit's like adult swim said do something and I said well I don't want to do something bad so I called\n\n01:52:25.220 --> 01:52:31.860\nJustin and then like just just just yes and Justin into this thing that makes so many people happy\n\n01:52:31.860 --> 01:52:37.140\nthat then also now is the thing that I'm gonna end up that is gonna represent the biggest paycheck\n\n01:52:37.140 --> 01:52:42.420\nI've ever gotten out of all the shit that I've ever done and it it's also the thing that was just\n\n01:52:42.420 --> 01:52:46.820\nfun so what is all this other daffy duck shit that I'm always pulling where I'm like well you\n\n01:52:46.820 --> 01:52:52.500\nknow I think that fiber optic is the future so I want to get in a room with Taco Bell and\n\n01:52:52.500 --> 01:52:58.660\ntalk to them about a sketch show made of ground beef yeah where you can vote for each crouton and\n\n01:52:58.660 --> 01:53:06.100\nI've got I call it the Harmon Taco Deluxe uh package and like like I'm trying to be a producer\n\n01:53:06.100 --> 01:53:12.260\nbecause I'm in a panic you know yeah I don't I don't know the answer I guess it just depends on\n\n01:53:12.260 --> 01:53:19.220\nwhat yeah what you how you value your time and how you value your sanity and and and how and if money\n\n01:53:19.220 --> 01:53:25.620\nis the most important thing or if it's just like oh I want to make something that I really like and\n\n01:53:26.500 --> 01:53:30.660\nyou know I don't know I don't know it's different for everybody I guess except for the hustle the\n\n01:53:30.660 --> 01:53:36.180\nhustle is the same for all yeah yeah whether it comes from wanting to retire earlier whether it\n\n01:53:36.180 --> 01:53:39.940\ncomes from having to put foot on the table or whether it comes from wherever it's it does not\n\n01:53:39.940 --> 01:53:44.820\nchange well that's what's funny but you've been great at it well I don't know about great but I\n\n01:53:44.820 --> 01:53:48.980\njust try to fucking keep doing shit but uh but thank you for saying that but but that's what's\n\n01:53:48.980 --> 01:53:54.020\nfunny to me is like people online or whatever like on Twitter or whatever just like what when people\n\n01:53:54.020 --> 01:53:58.660\nsay like why the fuck would you do that what you know see you in something that shitty like oh why\n\n01:53:58.660 --> 01:54:04.420\nwould you do it's like well one you just try a lot of shit some of it is good some of it is not good\n\n01:54:04.420 --> 01:54:09.620\nyou saw something that wasn't that good I'm doing other shit too you know um but I agree with you\n\n01:54:09.620 --> 01:54:14.340\nthat thing was not that good you know like you know whatever but uh why were you in Garfield seven\n\n01:54:14.340 --> 01:54:18.820\nyeah yeah yeah um and then and then yeah but then there's stuff like that like like I would be in\n\n01:54:18.820 --> 01:54:23.140\nGarfield seven in a heartbeat well because the stakes are pretty low like you shouldn't care if\n\n01:54:23.140 --> 01:54:27.780\nyou're why are you watching Garfield seven exactly that's that's what I say why the fuck are you\n\n01:54:27.780 --> 01:54:35.140\nwatching why why did you see me at that party yeah yeah I would love to be in Garfield seven\n\n01:54:35.140 --> 01:54:41.460\nI feel like that stigma has gone away which is a good thing probably but it's gone away because\n\n01:54:41.460 --> 01:54:50.340\nlike that Hollywood like edifice has been cracked like we're we're on it like people look at what\n\n01:54:50.340 --> 01:54:56.180\nwe do as honest labor now a little bit they look at it as very very privileged like we're lucky\n\n01:54:56.180 --> 01:55:04.020\nbecause I haven't lifted a box in years yeah um and I have a five bedroom house and I don't have\n\n01:55:04.020 --> 01:55:10.980\nfive children I have two dogs and some slim gyms and and and it's like so it's a mansion\n\n01:55:11.700 --> 01:55:18.420\nrelative to what I've done and who I am and it's a fucking wonderful life um and so it's\n\n01:55:18.420 --> 01:55:23.540\nbut I do at the same time think that on an unconscious level people don't think about it\n\n01:55:23.540 --> 01:55:28.580\nanymore the way they used to I remember when David Cross was in small soldiers too or something\n\n01:55:28.580 --> 01:55:35.300\nand I was like what David yeah because I was fresh off the boat from Milwaukee and was like\n\n01:55:35.300 --> 01:55:40.260\noh yeah it's just everything was a choice and everything mattered and like I don't think any\n\n01:55:40.260 --> 01:55:46.020\nI can't imagine anybody's like Aubrey Plaza why'd you do Grumpy Cat like like like I don't I think\n\n01:55:46.020 --> 01:55:51.700\nthe answer to everything now is because it's a joke because life's a joke right because\n\n01:55:51.700 --> 01:55:57.380\nbecause working is important and it also sometimes it's like it was December and there was nothing\n\n01:55:57.380 --> 01:56:02.820\nelse going on I wanted to go to fucking you know they were shooting it in Australia and I thought\n\n01:56:02.820 --> 01:56:06.900\nthat'd be a fun place to go but that old world I was in the middle of depression and they called\n\n01:56:06.900 --> 01:56:10.660\nso I had to get off the couch yeah or I just broke up with my boyfriend and I wanted to get away\n\n01:56:10.660 --> 01:56:18.900\nfrom him so I went to yeah me wondering why David Cross is in small soldiers too uh comes from this\n\n01:56:18.900 --> 01:56:24.980\nweird old world supposition that the goal is to become Kerry Grant or something that there's gonna\n\n01:56:24.980 --> 01:56:28.900\nbe like like Laura you're gonna be in Lawrence of Arabia if you play your cards right or you're\n\n01:56:28.900 --> 01:56:33.460\ngonna beat Bill Murray and like I just don't we don't we see that doesn't exist anymore I don't\n\n01:56:33.460 --> 01:56:37.540\nyeah it's hard to tell though because it's a moving target because like my world has become\n\n01:56:37.540 --> 01:56:42.180\ncompletely different so I don't know if when I like I don't know if the world has changed or I've\n\n01:56:42.180 --> 01:56:48.260\nchanged but when I see a a poster on a bus stop and like Paul F. Tompkins is looking out from\n\n01:56:48.260 --> 01:56:53.300\nbehind a genie bottle or whatever that's I'm making that up that's not real but but if if I saw that\n\n01:56:53.300 --> 01:57:00.580\nI would be like I toot my horn and go like fuck yes Paul F. get it get that paycheck yes um but\n\n01:57:00.580 --> 01:57:08.660\nI don't but maybe that's that's a total distortion of of working out here yeah I don't I don't know\n\n01:57:08.660 --> 01:57:14.820\nthat those uh that that status exists anymore of like oh then you just like the Kerry Grant\n\n01:57:14.820 --> 01:57:19.060\nanalogy is like a good one but yeah I don't I don't think that exists I don't think you ever\n\n01:57:19.060 --> 01:57:24.340\ngraduate to this stratosphere where then you just fucking like coast you know and you're just in\n\n01:57:24.340 --> 01:57:30.820\nthe fucking huge awesome projects I mean maybe like I feel like Chris Pratt has done that you know\n\n01:57:30.820 --> 01:57:38.180\nlike in a in a cool way like he's in huge cool movies and uh you know uh you know even Middle\n\n01:57:38.180 --> 01:57:44.180\nDitch is doing phone ads that and and usually you didn't do those at the same time you do a series\n\n01:57:44.180 --> 01:57:48.100\nget off the series and you'd be like do you guys miss me I'm repping I'm repping a product but\n\n01:57:48.100 --> 01:57:53.860\nwhen I see Middle Ditch on that phone ad my first thought is cha-ching yeah like yeah so happy\n\n01:57:53.860 --> 01:57:57.380\nsmart I think all that has changed I think the the commercial thing has changed I think like\n\n01:57:57.380 --> 01:58:01.860\nnow yeah there's no shame in that like I feel like that's just fucking and it's simultaneous their\n\n01:58:01.860 --> 01:58:06.900\nmoney yeah you're on a tv show yeah and you've got great commercials it's great yeah cuz and I\n\n01:58:06.900 --> 01:58:13.060\nwould feel the same way about an NFL player like if you I I'm not a fan of sports but every time I\n\n01:58:13.060 --> 01:58:20.420\nsee an athlete in a sock commercial or something I'm like oh good save your money like don't like\n\n01:58:20.420 --> 01:58:24.900\nyou're a gladiator and they're gonna murder you and hang you up to dry I'm like it's so great for\n\n01:58:24.900 --> 01:58:30.500\nyou and your family that you got to like advertise beef steak or something like like if you make it\n\n01:58:30.500 --> 01:58:35.460\nthrough that thing like just put that money in a coffee can and fucking guard it with a shotgun\n\n01:58:35.460 --> 01:58:41.940\nlike buy a house in the worst part of the country and so that it stays there forever stay form\n\n01:58:41.940 --> 01:58:49.940\nit's the greatest assurance that'll play stay form my name is jumping jack the lightning\n\n01:58:49.940 --> 01:58:56.260\nyou probably ask yourself why I'm at our hop is there is there any commercial not that you were\n\n01:58:56.260 --> 01:59:02.260\ndoing him but is there any commercial that Shaq will not be back pain like bad pills\n\n01:59:02.260 --> 01:59:15.380\ntaco bell pepsi don't backpill the pins underwear yeah yeah I was at the I was at the Turner\n\n01:59:15.380 --> 01:59:25.140\nup front and who was the it was the combination of like Conan and I think Charles Barkley and\n\n01:59:25.140 --> 01:59:31.700\nuh Anderson Cooper like really fun but I was I was a mate like Charles Barkley is like really\n\n01:59:31.700 --> 01:59:37.140\nfunny as I was like really is he known as among that I don't know him he's hilarious but I mean\n\n01:59:37.140 --> 01:59:43.300\ndo people do people like is his reputation is he like the Jenny McCarthy of basketball players\n\n01:59:43.300 --> 01:59:48.580\nin that it's like oh look he can like make faces too it's like he's the David Lee Roth of\n\n01:59:48.580 --> 01:59:56.420\num basketball players you're like man fuck this you're funny but fuck this dude\n\n01:59:57.620 --> 02:00:04.420\nbut he does have uh
