00:00.000 --> 00:12.000
Ladies and gentlemen, around the world, wherever you may be, get ready for Harmontown.

00:12.000 --> 00:15.000
Welcome to the stage, the mayor of Harmontown.

00:15.000 --> 00:17.000
You know who he is.

00:17.000 --> 00:19.000
You know how he gets down.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
Damn Harmon.

00:21.000 --> 00:28.000
Beats, beats, rap, rapping beats, beating to the rap, the rap that can't be beat.

00:28.000 --> 00:34.000
Dan Harmon on the microphone, slipping your mama's, my Harmon bone.

00:34.000 --> 00:38.000
It's a tiny penis, but it gets the job done.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
It's not the way you use it.

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
It's whether you have fun and whether she does too.

00:43.000 --> 00:47.000
And if you have her consent and whether you do it in a sleeping bag or tent.

00:47.000 --> 00:51.000
I took your mama camping up at Algonquin Falls.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
It's a place outside of shopping malls.

00:54.000 --> 00:58.000
Zombies attacked and we took refuge in the building.

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
I fucked your mama so hard, I was gilding her pussy.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
My penis is gold.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
It plates your pussy.

01:06.000 --> 01:11.000
As I'm told, it's a chemical process called electroplating.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
I fucked it.

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
Fuck your mama when I'm masturbating.

01:16.000 --> 01:20.000
Yo, yo, yo.

01:20.000 --> 01:25.000
2006, motherfuckers.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
Yeah.

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
I saw a pumpkin once.

01:30.000 --> 01:34.000
I saw a paper hat on a dunce, a paper cone.

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
You wear it like a hat.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
You punish kids like that.

01:39.000 --> 01:44.000
You make them wear a cone made out of paper.

01:44.000 --> 01:49.000
It's like Don Draper did in 1961.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
Fuck your mama so hard.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
I made her come.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
She came all night.

01:57.000 --> 02:04.000
She saw the light, the coming light, the orgasm light, the Christian light.

02:04.000 --> 02:09.000
I gave her what's right, put her on the cross, sucked on her feet,

02:09.000 --> 02:17.000
poked her with a spear just to make sure she was dead.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
That's fucked up.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
After three days, she woke up.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
She came back out.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
She said, give me more dick because what's up?

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
I took her down to the park at dark.

02:28.000 --> 02:32.000
Fucked her until it was no longer dark.

02:32.000 --> 02:36.000
The sun come up on me fucking your mom.

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
She took a pom-pom.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
She did a splits in the air.

02:41.000 --> 02:46.000
She said, rah-rah, hooray chair.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
And I said, table.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
She said, furniture.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
I said, table.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
We were free associating.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
Fucked your mama so hard.

02:57.000 --> 03:02.000
I was electroplating her with the aforementioned system.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
I fucked your mama.

03:04.000 --> 03:08.000
But listen, she liked it.

03:08.000 --> 03:12.000
And afterwards, we went biking.

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
Cardiovascular.

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
It was spectacular.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
Raise your heart rate.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
Don't even masturbate.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
No FAP, F-A-P.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
No, not for me.

03:27.000 --> 03:31.000
Fucking your mama's the only activity I want to be doing.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
Coming inside, it's an organic process.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
Makes your orgasm more wide.

03:36.000 --> 03:40.000
Fulfilling the bandwidth of your pleasure.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
Fucked your mama at my leisure.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
It's a job, though.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
I get it done.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
Like Larry Cable Guy.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
I'm number one.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
Yipp-yipp-yipp-yipp.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
Yipp-yipp-yipp-yipp.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
Yipp-yipp-yipp-yipp.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
Harmontown.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
It's the show that's beginning.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
Harmontown is not the show that's losing.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
It's the show that's winning.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
There's no audience allowed in the warehouse.

04:05.000 --> 04:09.000
Because the man came down and shut it down.

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
Thousand Island dressing.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
Yo.

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
Deborah Messing.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
Deborah Messing.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Yo.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
Deborah Messing.

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
Deborah Messing isn't messing around.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
Harmontown is about to go down.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
And then it comes up.

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
All right.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
Shout out to Deborah Messing.

04:36.000 --> 04:41.000
Yeah, thank you, Deborah Messing, for having that name.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
All right.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
Well, yeah, I thought, I thought if we started with a wrap,

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
that maybe the energy would be up more.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
I forgot.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
Yeah, I forgot about this.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
I feel like people at home are definitely bopping their heads.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
Yeah.

04:54.000 --> 04:59.000
Well, yeah, so I was shaving.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
I was trimming.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
I was trying to trim my beard to go to this thing.

05:03.000 --> 05:10.000
I had to do this Rosemarie documentary Q&A with Dick Van Dyke.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
I was like, I'm going to be sitting next to Dick Van Dyke.

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
He's a very handsome guy.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
Respect.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
Yeah.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
So I tried to trim a little bit.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
And then I nicked.

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
And I disconnected right where the mustache meets the beard.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
And I was like, oh, I better do that on the other side.

05:26.000 --> 05:31.000
I look like a ventriloquist dummy or like an Amish Japanese

05:31.000 --> 05:37.000
assassin, an Amish ninja fusion.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
I don't know what it looked really distinct.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
It looked really specific.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
And it was going to distract me all night.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
So then I just shaved the whole beard.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
Rather than look like a shitty auctioneer.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
Yeah.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
So now I look great.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
How do you feel, though?

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
Because you look younger.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
Yeah, but what's the point of being younger

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
if you're a young tub of shit?

05:58.000 --> 06:06.000
You look like a young fucking sad pimply seal.

06:06.000 --> 06:11.000
But not a sad pimply seal a day over five,

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
which is 50 in seal years.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
How was it?

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
It was interesting.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
I really like that documentary.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
I really recommend it a lot.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
It has the unintended effect of making you kind of comfortable

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
with mortality.

06:25.000 --> 06:29.000
Rose Marie is 95 years old, 94.

06:29.000 --> 06:34.000
She's almost literally born entertaining.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
She's like four years old, and she's like singing.

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
And then she's 94 at the end of the documentary.

06:39.000 --> 06:43.000
And she's saying, like, why am I left?

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
Does anybody have a work for me?

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
I can come in my wheelchair.

06:47.000 --> 06:51.000
And she's just like, anybody want me to do something?

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
I'll do something.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
And I was like, yeah, there's that.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
Or then there's the Jim Carrey method.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
I watched that documentary where Jim Carrey talks

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
about being Andy Kaufman.

07:02.000 --> 07:06.000
And his whole thing is like, none of this matters.

07:06.000 --> 07:10.000
And he's like, oh, that's not a coffee cup.

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
I'm not about to drink out of it.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
Now I did.

07:14.000 --> 07:18.000
And he had to, if you're Jim Carrey, you probably have to,

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
you can't just be like, I'll do anything.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
So then you have to be like, OK, how

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
do I feel about having a trillion dollars?

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
Yeah.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
Yeah.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
And being broke, he started out so poor.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
Yeah.

07:29.000 --> 07:34.000
And Canadian, which is like, yeah.

07:34.000 --> 07:38.000
That's like the poverty of nationalities.

07:38.000 --> 07:42.000
So even a rich Canadian is like a fucking,

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
it's already starting at zero.

07:47.000 --> 07:51.000
I'd apologize, but Canadians don't care.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
Yeah, they're too nice.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
Yeah.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
They're apologizing to me.

07:54.000 --> 07:58.000
Yeah, they just happen to be shouted out at this point.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
They're tweeting, I'm sorry.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
You call this piece of shit right now.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
So you were inside a lot, I take it, when you weren't going out,

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
because that means you watched a lot of documentaries.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
Yeah.

08:12.000 --> 08:16.000
I mean, do you go outside a lot?

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
I go outside a lot.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
You do?

08:18.000 --> 08:18.000
Yeah.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
Yeah, that's where the people are.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
Yeah.

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
I like to watch the people.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
How can you keep an eye on all of them?

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
You know that one of them is going to kill you, right?

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
Yeah.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
Well, I keep an eye on that one, especially.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
The only way to guarantee you don't die by person

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
is to stay away from all of them,

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
and that they are the number one killer of people right now.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
I mean, I'm just trying.

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
There's a lot of places that I've seen things go down,

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
so I know not to go to certain concerts in certain places.

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
How would you have known to avoid the,

08:48.000 --> 08:52.000
I think you would have considered the Don McLean,

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
what was that guy's name?

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
I'm not headed to like an Eagles reunion.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
I'm not going to any sort of like.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
You can't tell what concert's going to get.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
I can.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
Going to get blowed up.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
What do you mean?

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
You can't tell?

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
Are you magical?

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
Are you like a CW hero?

09:07.000 --> 09:11.000
Are you, do you have a, are you the mentalist?

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
The mentalist when it comes to concerts.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
Or are you saying you have a system?

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
I have a system.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
I live right beneath the Greek.

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
I've lived there for like 15 years, as you do as well.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
And you sort of get an idea of who's at the concert and what

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
the show is going to be by like who's marching up the hill.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
So yeah.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
Is there, is there a concert you'd buy a ticket to?

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
And then as you were walking up to the Greek theater,

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
you'd like stop and turn around because you didn't,

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
you're like, there's a lot of juggalos here.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
Fish.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
Juggalos.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
Juggalos.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
Juggalos.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
Juggalos.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
Juggalis.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
You were right.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
Juggal.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
You were so right.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
Juggal, juggal, juggalos.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
Juggal, juggal, juggal, juggalem.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
Juggalai.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
Juggalis.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
Juggalai.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
Juggalos or goose.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
So juggalis.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
Give me a beat.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
What's it all about?

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
Yo, going to concerts.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
Ah.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
Ah.

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
Yo.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
What's it all about?

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
Ah.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
Yo.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
What's it all about?

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
All right.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
That's it.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
Just hooks.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
Just hooks tonight, folks.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
No verse, just hooks tonight.

10:42.000 --> 10:46.000
Our guest tonight is Rob Hubel.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
Rob Hubel.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
Let's bring it up.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
You can sit.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
Yeah, over there.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
It's probably better.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
Hello, everybody.

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
There's no, there's, we got shut down by the Fire Marshall.

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
But there's, you know, there's the live streamers, right?

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
Yeah.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
Yeah.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
The subscribers.

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
Do you want to hear my subscriber rap?

11:18.000 --> 11:22.000
Dude, you're opening rap.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
You're really good at that.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
I'm not going to let that make this rap worse.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
Hit it.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
Yo.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
Yo.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
Subscribers.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
Yo.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
Inbibers.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
Yo.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
Philosophibers.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
Yo.

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
$5 a month getting this shit on.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
G Funk.

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
Helping us out financially.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
Financially.

11:45.000 --> 11:50.000
If I was a subscriber, I'd be like many driver.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
British, but fake the accent.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
Fuck your mama, an accident.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
Yo, I put my dick in her pussy.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
Said, whoops, whoops, whoops, whoopsie, whoopsie-dee.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
Whoop, whoop, whoop.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
There goes my dick.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
There goes my dick.

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
I slipped on my dick like a banana peel.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
I slipped on my dick.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
How does that make you feel?

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
My dick's so long and slippery.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
I ain't going to go to Tipperary.

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
I'm not an old-timey singer.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
Yo.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
Hit.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
Subscribers.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
Many drivers.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
Subscribers.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
In the driver's seat.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
Subscribers.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
$5 a month.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
$5 a month.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
Bring them.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
Bring the funk.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
My name is Fred.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
I'm a subscriber.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
Thank you, Fred.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
My name is Janet.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
I'm a subscriber.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
Thank you, Janet.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
I see Tony.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
I see Sharonda.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
I see Peter Fonda.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
A lot of people don't know he subscribes.

12:44.000 --> 12:47.000
Remember in that movie where he drives a motorcycle

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
with Dennis Hopper?

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
I fucked your mama from the bottom and the topper.

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
I fucked her titties first, then her feet.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
Then I did it backwards to the beat.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
I said, hip hop.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
I fucked your fuck.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
Fuck.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
Fuck.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
Fuck.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
Fuck.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
Fuck.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
That's a backwards fuck.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
Yo, I fucked your mama's butt.

13:06.000 --> 13:09.000
She didn't know what to expect.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
Just hurt.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
John hurt.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
John hurt was a robot.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
Then aliens.

13:15.000 --> 13:18.000
Fucked your mama so hard, she was a praline.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
Just dumb.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
You don't have to.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
All right.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
Cut it.

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
You don't have to rhyme everything.

13:25.000 --> 13:29.000
That was intense.

13:29.000 --> 13:33.000
There's a recurring theme.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
I'm just picking up on a recurring theme

13:35.000 --> 13:39.000
about you fucking our moms.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
Right.

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
Yeah, it's kind of a, it's been identified as a sort of crutch

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
or a tick.

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
It's kind of hard to get around.

13:48.000 --> 13:51.000
But it only touches on it briefly.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
Then it goes away and then it comes back.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
Then it drills down really hard on that.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
Yeah.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
Kind of goes away again.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
Yeah.

13:58.000 --> 14:04.000
But if I were like working out at the gym,

14:04.000 --> 14:07.000
I could take that song.

14:07.000 --> 14:11.000
I'd put that song on the playlist.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
It motivates you.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
Yeah.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
Right.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
You don't want to be lean for someone's mama.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
Who made these beats?

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
Who made these beats?

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
A couple of them are from Paramount.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
A couple of them are from Paramount.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
Oh, parallel.

14:26.000 --> 14:29.000
Do we have the rights to these beats?

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
Can I have some of this?

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
Yeah, absolutely.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
Yeah, fix yourself up a little cocktail.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
Thank you.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
And I'll tell you what, I'll make you a special wrap

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
just for your workouts.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
Oh, sure.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
Give me a beat.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
Yeah.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
Yo.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
Rob Hubel.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
Workout.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
Wrap.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
Yo.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
Warm up.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
Yo.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
Stretch.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
Don't forget to stretch.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
Yo.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
Stretch your feet.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
Stretch your thighs.

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
Stretch your abdomen.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
I'm fucking your mama again.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
What?

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
Tonight.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
Stretch your quads.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
Stretch your glutes.

15:06.000 --> 15:09.000
Fuck your mama with my dick flute.

15:09.000 --> 15:13.000
Toot-a-toot-a-toot-a-toot-a-toot-a-toot.

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
Mrs. Hubel is coming to school.

15:16.000 --> 15:19.000
Teaching her with my dick tonight.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
Workout tape.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
Workout wrap.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
Doing it right.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
Fuck your head.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
Fuck your eyes.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
Fuck your ears.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
Stretch them out.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
Mrs. Hubel has no fears.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
I don't like this.

15:31.000 --> 15:39.000
I'm going to swage her fears through exposure therapy.

15:39.000 --> 15:45.000
If she was scared of spiders, I'd slowly get her used to spiders.

15:45.000 --> 15:48.000
But she's just scared of my dick.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
Scared of my dick.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
So I'll give it a lick.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
I'll lick my own dick.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
Show her it's easy.

15:56.000 --> 15:59.000
A licker dick.

15:59.000 --> 16:05.000
Then I get between her knees.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
Mrs. Hubel, please.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
Can I fuck you till the break?

16:08.000 --> 16:12.000
Break a dawn to the early light.

16:12.000 --> 16:16.000
Mrs. Hubel, I might like to fuck you some more.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
On all fours.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
Doggy style they call it.

16:19.000 --> 16:22.000
But I don't like that language.

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
Because you're a woman to me.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
A human first.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
A partner second.

16:28.000 --> 16:32.000
A woman third.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
A dog fourth.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
All right.

16:36.000 --> 16:40.000
Pick it up.

16:40.000 --> 16:44.000
Don't forget to cool down.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
Cool down now.

16:46.000 --> 16:49.000
Did a good workout while I rapped.

16:49.000 --> 16:55.000
Rob Hubel's workout rap is a masterpiece.

16:55.000 --> 16:58.000
Fucked his mama in the east.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
Went to Pittsburgh.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
Eastern seaboard.

17:02.000 --> 17:06.000
Fucked his mama so hard she blew out a knee cord.

17:06.000 --> 17:09.000
They call it the ligature.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
Did I fuck Rob Hubel's mom?

17:11.000 --> 17:16.000
Sure, but then I married her after.

17:16.000 --> 17:20.000
And I gave her some dues from after.

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
And SAG and BMI.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
Ass cap.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
Don't go asking me why.

17:27.000 --> 17:31.000
Because the ass is there and it needs something on it.

17:31.000 --> 17:35.000
Watched Rob Hubel's mom's ass without a bonnet.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
She comes at you backwards.

17:37.000 --> 17:42.000
Looks like a Cyclops baby.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
All right.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
Yeah, don't forget.

17:45.000 --> 17:49.000
Walk it off and hydrate.

17:49.000 --> 17:52.000
That was the most upsetting thing.

17:52.000 --> 17:56.000
Thankfully, my mom is not a subscriber.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
And we'll not see that.

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
Was any of that true?

18:01.000 --> 18:04.000
The exposure therapy part seemed realistic to me.

18:04.000 --> 18:07.000
Yeah, it's research.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
She does wear a bonnet, I can confirm.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
On her ass, yes.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
Ass cap.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
She does wear a bonnet on her ass.

18:12.000 --> 18:15.000
Someone from Ass Cap too.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
A bonnet on her ass, yeah.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
That was good.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
I got so excited about the bonnet.

18:20.000 --> 18:25.000
With the riming on it that I fucked up.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
You realize you do have a rhyme,

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
it will fuck up your shit.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
I'm so winded.

18:28.000 --> 18:31.000
Did you guys get that?

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
I was on a treadmill.

18:32.000 --> 18:36.000
Yeah, you were booping.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
Really adjusted all the speeds there.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
I really am out of shape.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
I haven't worked out in a long time.

18:41.000 --> 18:48.000
Do you guys have any phobias that are genuine phobias?

18:48.000 --> 18:53.980
definition is not just being scared of something a lot or more than other people, but phobia

18:53.980 --> 19:02.900
is a fear that would interfere with your ability to function in a certain situation. If you're

19:02.900 --> 19:05.300
unable to go out on a balcony.

19:05.300 --> 19:15.000
Yeah. I don't know that I have a phobia by definition. I've had a couple of freakouts

19:15.000 --> 19:21.840
that I didn't, when I didn't know I had this sort of, like one time we were shooting something

19:21.840 --> 19:29.060
and I had to wear a space suit for this sketch that we were doing and I put on a, and they

19:29.060 --> 19:34.500
got it, for some reason they got a real space suit from NASA, like a legit space suit with

19:34.500 --> 19:43.020
a helmet and everything. And I put the helmet on and it screws on to the neck thing and

19:43.020 --> 19:49.420
all of a sudden I couldn't get it off and nobody could get it off. And I had a fucking

19:49.420 --> 19:52.660
freakout panic attack, like I was like get it off, get it off, get it off, get it off,

19:52.660 --> 19:56.020
get it off. And no one was like okay just calm down, calm down, and like the thing,

19:56.020 --> 20:01.020
like the visor was closed and so it was like fogging up and you know I just instantly thought

20:01.020 --> 20:06.740
like oh I'm just going to run out of air and I would have been fine if I had just relaxed

20:06.740 --> 20:10.980
but so I had a major freakout. That's not a phobia though. Because that was impending

20:10.980 --> 20:17.260
death. I guess I'm scared of space suits. For space. Astronauts.

20:17.260 --> 20:23.380
Yeah, when I was a kid and we would play hide and go seek and stuff in the neighborhood

20:23.380 --> 20:32.500
flashlight tag, I would, I was like, my strategy was I would find the creepiest, darkest, tightest

20:32.500 --> 20:37.180
fucking place where any human being would never even look because it'd be like why

20:37.180 --> 20:41.740
would a person even fit in there or go in there and then I would just hang out in there

20:41.740 --> 20:47.420
until the game was over and come out victorious. But like I and then at some point I wonder

20:47.420 --> 20:51.180
if puberty does it or if it's did I bring it up because another thing I used to do is

20:51.180 --> 20:55.700
just let bugs and shit crawl all over me. But I think I know what happened there is

20:55.700 --> 21:02.860
like I was so fascinated with bugs and spiders and stuff that my aunt gave me for Christmas

21:02.860 --> 21:12.580
gift. A big time life book of big full color hardcover book full of the most poisonous spiders

21:12.580 --> 21:17.780
in the world and like these crazy like close up photography and like all these statistics

21:17.780 --> 21:21.820
about how fast they can crawl up your arm and go in your ear and stuff and like I think

21:21.820 --> 21:27.900
the book freaked me out made me start thinking of spiders as I think maybe I don't know

21:27.900 --> 21:33.100
though. So are you currently claustrophobic and terrified of spiders? Yes. Okay. Yeah

21:33.100 --> 21:37.460
so I don't know. Did it change? We had a really funny prank we were going to do. And

21:37.460 --> 21:42.940
it called coffin full of spiders. I mean everyone's I wonder about you know when it

21:42.940 --> 21:48.140
comes to being afraid of being locked in a coffin and buried alive that's not a phobia

21:48.140 --> 21:51.740
that's just I think everybody yeah everyone has that fear and it's not an irrational

21:51.740 --> 21:56.340
fear. Yeah. You should be afraid of that. You'd be it'd be weird it'd be a weird disorder

21:56.340 --> 22:01.820
if you were if you were into it. I've done that and yeah again that's not really a phobia

22:01.820 --> 22:06.980
I guess but one time I sound like I shoot a lot of things but we were doing some pilot

22:06.980 --> 22:11.300
that didn't get picked up and I was supposed to be dead and but they were shipping my body

22:11.300 --> 22:17.460
back home or something so I was in a coffin and just for this one scene but it was filled

22:17.460 --> 22:22.100
with coffee beans so they covered me in coffee beans because they were like smuggling my body

22:22.100 --> 22:26.220
out of the country or something like that. So I had to lay in this coffin as they buried

22:26.220 --> 22:31.060
me in coffee beans like over my face and then they shut the coffin and I will say that was

22:31.060 --> 22:35.540
not cool. Jesus. Yeah that was pretty freaky. Good news is when that really happens you will

22:35.540 --> 22:41.300
be dead. Yes. So you have to worry about it. Yeah. Unless you get buried alive on accident

22:41.300 --> 22:45.980
what do you mean. You still did. At that point you're like 15 minutes away from dead. Yeah.

22:45.980 --> 22:51.380
Yeah the most horrible death. What are you afraid of Brandon. The dentist I cannot stand

22:51.380 --> 22:55.460
the dentist. Really. Yeah I have to get all doped up. I have to get a car service. It's

22:55.460 --> 22:59.100
a nightmare. Really not stand the dentist. I didn't have it. It was because we have a

22:59.100 --> 23:07.380
funny prank plan for you. What. No. A coffin full of dentists. God damn it. Dressed as

23:07.380 --> 23:13.180
spiders. Yeah right. With coffee beans. So do you just not go to the dentist. No I go

23:13.180 --> 23:16.540
to the dentist all the time because I'm terrible. I mean all the time. I mean I go to the dentist

23:16.540 --> 23:23.420
a lot. Yeah too much. Too much. I'm currently dating my dentist. I have a I have a deep

23:23.420 --> 23:30.220
cleaning coming up. Yeah. At Hollywood dental. Steve Levy booked me a dentist. Shout out Hollywood

23:30.220 --> 23:36.900
dental. All your dental needs. They're the keys to the bathroom are on a little Oscar

23:36.900 --> 23:44.620
trophies. Does he have headshots of like famous people. I think I think so. You think I would

23:44.620 --> 23:52.980
have looked at him. But the whole place is that's themed after like fame. It's a famed

23:52.980 --> 23:58.700
themed dentist. I found a little tacky. That's a great theme. And I texted Levy I was like

23:58.700 --> 24:04.740
really Hollywood Hollywood themed dentist place. And he's like it's got a really good

24:04.740 --> 24:10.460
reputation. And I was like well yeah that's really fancy. I mean there's stars everywhere

24:10.460 --> 24:16.420
and but I don't know. Did you just read their press release or I feel like the next sexual

24:16.420 --> 24:22.420
harassment thing the next wave is going to be in the dental world just because that seems

24:22.420 --> 24:28.940
like it would be so easy. Yeah. You know all of your patients are asleep and certainly

24:28.940 --> 24:32.700
there are tons of stories of waking up and there's like a dick on your shoulder. Right.

24:32.700 --> 24:36.060
You're pointing at me like I did. I didn't do that. Yeah there are. No there are tons

24:36.060 --> 24:40.380
of those stories. I put my dick on the dentist shoulder when well we had a wave of those.

24:40.380 --> 24:45.260
Yeah. I mean speaking of things that I'm surprised haven't come up and given the current climate

24:45.260 --> 24:50.020
like man Sean Penn must be just in a fucking cellar somewhere with a crossbow pointed at

24:50.020 --> 24:56.460
the door. Yeah it seems like there would be a lot of people that are like oh it's almost

24:56.460 --> 25:02.220
like it's almost like some people whose savagery was outed 20 years ago are like getting some

25:02.220 --> 25:07.500
kind of grandfathered in or something. Yeah. Oh yeah. Like I type it down into a chair

25:07.500 --> 25:13.060
and beater for three days but you know I got caught doing that. I paid my debt to society

25:13.060 --> 25:17.100
by making some movies. Yeah. Let's all still play Chris Brown and

25:17.100 --> 25:23.900
R Kelly. Yeah. It's the craziest thing. It seems like there's it's going to like spread

25:23.900 --> 25:30.620
to pro sports and music people. Those are easy though. Yeah. So easy. I want like every

25:30.620 --> 25:36.460
industry to start Wall Street and yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I want doctors and dentists and mailmen

25:36.460 --> 25:41.740
I want the whole mailman. Yeah. You know mailman get down. My mailman comes to my door with

25:41.740 --> 25:46.500
his dick out. Are you guys scared that it's going to extend

25:46.500 --> 25:55.460
to like just like secrets though like private victimless stuff that just makes you a sicko

25:55.460 --> 26:03.100
like if I if we start opening laptops and looking at bookmarks and stuff like like is

26:03.100 --> 26:06.260
it do you ever worry that it's just going to get to that where it's like what do you think

26:06.260 --> 26:11.580
about when you masturbate or what it seems like it seems like there would be a line

26:11.580 --> 26:18.100
somewhere where and also just it seems like eventually there will be so much of it that

26:18.100 --> 26:21.460
none of it resonates. Do you know what I mean. Right. Yeah. I keep

26:21.460 --> 26:26.620
worrying about that too. Like they're being too much of a backlash. Yeah. Or once it comes

26:26.620 --> 26:33.780
out once somebody proves that any of that and that didn't mean to derail us into this

26:33.780 --> 26:36.100
conversation. I don't think you did. I think I probably

26:36.100 --> 26:44.860
but I don't reason why we brought it up. But eventually someone will will get caught making

26:44.860 --> 26:49.060
it up. Someone will be like oh I made it up. I was trying to get money or whatever and

26:49.060 --> 26:55.220
then that will that scares me because that could discredit the whole situation or or

26:55.220 --> 26:58.620
delete the whole. I also worry about either between that or

26:58.620 --> 27:05.580
just the sheer volume of it and the breadth of it that like it'll play into you know men's

27:05.580 --> 27:10.420
hands and they can go like see what happens after like a year and a half of it. Yeah.

27:10.420 --> 27:16.260
That men will go see ladies. Yeah. You just you can't you can't run the party.

27:16.260 --> 27:20.460
Right. This is this has gotten crazy. You know why don't we and then it's going to and

27:20.460 --> 27:25.140
then we just go into Handmaid's Tale because it like gets so like if something happens

27:25.140 --> 27:28.860
where like a dude gets burnt alive. I haven't seen Handmaid's Tale. No spoilers.

27:28.860 --> 27:33.980
Yeah. But like like if there was a yeah I guess I'm saying the same thing you are going

27:33.980 --> 27:37.780
to be like if there was like some crazy thing or like a guy got stoned to death or something

27:37.780 --> 27:43.700
at an Albertsons and then and then it was the wrong Jeremy Piven. It was like Jeremiah

27:43.700 --> 27:51.060
Piven. Yeah. And he was like a feminist activist. There is not his way to paint a sign right

27:51.060 --> 27:56.580
now. There's a Brian Posein and a Brian Posein. Brian Posein has just been outed. Oh really

27:56.580 --> 28:01.900
in Chicago. It's a big deal in the comedy community. And there's an L.A. group of people

28:01.900 --> 28:08.340
who know about him. But Brian Posein is getting teased a little bit of the drama. I feel bad

28:08.340 --> 28:13.780
for real Joe Walsh because there's that Joe Walsh guy on Twitter. He's like always like

28:13.780 --> 28:17.780
hey you ever notice Santa Claus isn't black or whatever. And then yeah that confused me

28:17.780 --> 28:21.380
and it's always just Joe Walsh. And then like what the fuck. And then people will make jokes

28:21.380 --> 28:27.580
like hey you're you're living a life of illusion if you don't think that you know the health

28:27.580 --> 28:32.660
care should be socialized. I'm like this is so confusing and sad like I thought for a

28:32.660 --> 28:36.740
hot second that Joe Walsh had become like a P.J. O'Rourke figure or something that he

28:36.740 --> 28:41.540
was like. I did too. Yeah. He was like life's been good to me so far. Life's been really

28:41.540 --> 28:46.180
good to me so far. Yeah. You know what. And it's because I worked hard. Yeah. Pulled

28:46.180 --> 28:53.940
a Guinness Miller. I pulled myself up by my bootstraps. No but Jeff Davis knows the real

28:53.940 --> 28:59.380
Joe Walsh who's still out there bopping around and being groovy and playing with the Eagles.

28:59.380 --> 29:04.580
Like did Glenn Fry died right. Yeah. Yeah. So I guess I think maybe Glenn Fry's death

29:04.580 --> 29:10.020
like brought the other Eagles closer and now they're like I think touring and stuff. Oh

29:10.020 --> 29:15.420
really. Something for you kids to get excited about. The audience is going crazy. Right.

29:15.420 --> 29:25.380
We're going nuts. Cold War kids will be opening for them. If that means anything to you kids.

29:25.380 --> 29:31.500
I wonder if like if you are in a band that has seen better days let's say you know you

29:31.500 --> 29:37.980
guys were big at one point or legendary at one point but you still have to live and make

29:37.980 --> 29:42.700
a living and that's what you've been doing your whole life like I wonder if it eventually

29:42.700 --> 29:48.500
starts to suck when you're just like doing county fairs. And you know you're like she's

29:48.500 --> 29:55.460
my cherry fuck. Yeah. I'm sure there's no offense to warrant or if that's the total

29:55.460 --> 30:00.060
offense. Yeah. I'm sure there's bands against each individual each individual band and a

30:00.060 --> 30:05.420
case by case big like some of them are excited about it and some of them are like like hate

30:05.420 --> 30:10.660
it but it's like yeah we're not usually when somebody gets sick in the band and they're

30:10.660 --> 30:15.740
like we got to get together because Garth's going to need a kidney and he didn't invest

30:15.740 --> 30:21.500
so good after rehab and that's always kind of sweet to see. It's also kind of dark because

30:21.500 --> 30:24.980
the lead singer is like still prosperous and goes off on his own and kind of looks back

30:24.980 --> 30:33.260
at his band like I mean I'm Pharrell. Yeah. Fuck Garth. Fuck Garth. I'm Pharrell and you

30:33.260 --> 30:40.540
guys are nerd. It's great. Prince will get the revolution back together again because

30:40.540 --> 30:47.300
Lisa and Wendy need something. Lisa and Wendy need socks. They spent all their sock money.

30:47.300 --> 30:56.020
Yeah. I like that Pharrell and Garth are out there together. I let you know. New edition

30:56.020 --> 31:00.300
was like we got a Bobby Brown. We got to do something. We got to do it. We got to help

31:00.300 --> 31:13.860
him out. Yeah. I hope that I find a billion dollars under a rock tomorrow so I can curl

31:13.860 --> 31:26.140
up under my bed and wait for the world to end. That might happen. Give me a beat. I'm

31:26.140 --> 31:39.180
not working out to this. Zip it is. Zip it is. Yeah. Tomas Tomas Tomas. Yeah. French

31:39.180 --> 31:47.620
rapping. Tomas in the house. MC Tomas. Tomas. Tomas. Tolhouse. Tolhouse cookies in effect.

Put them on a sheet in the oven. Don't forget to take them out so they don't burn down your

31:52.100 --> 31:58.700
place. Tolhouse cookies all over the place. Bet you bite a chip motherfucker. Bet you bite

31:58.700 --> 32:07.260

32:34.980 --> 32:43.940
again. Spell out your orgasm. Tolhouse cookies. MC Tomas.

32:43.940 --> 32:59.460
Yo. Chips ahoy. It's a boy. Get the toys. I'm not jealous of devices. I think it makes

32:59.460 --> 33:06.740
me love nicest when a woman's got a vibrator. Tolhouse cookies come back later. Go in the

33:06.740 --> 33:22.020
basement and eat while she does it to herself with a dildo. Alright. Okay. Tolhouse cookies.

33:22.020 --> 33:34.660
You're open a can. Just eat it with a spoon because you're depressed. Yo. Yeah. Tell him

33:34.660 --> 33:40.300
how you do it. That's what he's saying. Okay. Yo. Okay. Alright. Here we go. Here's the

33:40.300 --> 33:49.420
thing. Alright. That was warming up. Take a stick. Take a log. Take your mama to a bog.

33:49.420 --> 34:00.140
The fumes come up. You inhale them. Yeah. I just like to tease him at the end with an

34:00.140 --> 34:03.420
adventure to a bog. It sounds like there was going to be a pretty cool adventure in that

34:03.420 --> 34:08.100
bog. Yeah. Yeah. People were going there with the stick. Yeah. I have to wait to see what

34:08.100 --> 34:13.380
happens. I was super into the Tolhouse thing and then it was not, he was saying show him

34:13.380 --> 34:19.380
how we do it. Yeah. Yeah. I thought he was saying Tomas. I wasn't sure. I probably don't

34:19.380 --> 34:22.500
need to tell you. I couldn't tell what he was saying. Yeah. And he was throwing me.

34:22.500 --> 34:28.540
My street when I was growing up was Tolhouse Road. No. Yeah. So I was I was pretty psyched

34:28.540 --> 34:35.580
about that when I was little. Did people make jokes? A lot of people. I was harassed a lot.

34:35.580 --> 34:42.620
People were like oh you fucking elf. You know. It was terrible. It was like now I can laugh

34:42.620 --> 34:46.380
about it. And if you corrected them and said that's Kebler. That's right. They'd be like

34:46.380 --> 34:51.380
oh now you're a cookie expert. So you are an elf. That's right. There's no point in

34:51.380 --> 35:00.020
even trying to correct it. Yeah. Everybody thought I was the Tolhouse cookie elf. I

35:00.020 --> 35:09.620
lived on 52nd in Calumet. Is that in Manhattan? Nope. Just sounds like it's in Milwaukee.

35:09.620 --> 35:15.940
My dog got hit on that road on Calumet. Calumet was a busy street. And if I ever want to make

35:15.940 --> 35:24.060
myself cry like when I'm acting, I can just think about the sound that my dog Susu made

35:24.060 --> 35:32.700
when she got hit. It was like a hit and run. And it was like crazy sound. Sound of the

35:32.700 --> 35:41.260
car. I remember. And then and then this like plaintiff whale that Susu made before just

35:41.260 --> 35:46.300
dropping dead. It's like she got hit and then went and then just made the sound and then

35:46.300 --> 35:53.860
died. And then I and then my dad had to go out and like scoop her up. And I was like

35:53.860 --> 35:58.860
a little kid was like an eye level with the dog as it was swinging in his hand. And he

35:58.860 --> 36:03.700
had this like annoyed look on his face. He was like really mad that the dog got hit.

36:03.700 --> 36:13.460
Oh, you've got to say give me a beat. A very long rap about your childhood pet getting

36:13.460 --> 36:20.100
killed. Yeah, I'm not going to dwell on this topic for long, but I remember our neighbors

36:20.100 --> 36:25.260
hit our cat and killed our cat one of our cats when we were little kids. And you know,

36:25.260 --> 36:29.900
they felt terrible and they came to the door. And the first thing out of their mouth was

36:29.900 --> 36:37.220
can we buy you a new cat? And we were like, why? What? Like, you know, they're like started

36:37.220 --> 36:46.820
three new cats. Bidding started three. They packed our house with so many cats and all

36:46.820 --> 36:52.180
was forgiven. No, it was just that was such a weird inclination on their part. Like this

36:52.180 --> 36:58.060
happened. Would it? We'll just get you a new one. It's like, are you not aware that we

36:58.060 --> 37:07.020
were attached to this? I know you're trying to be nice, but they didn't know what to say.

37:07.020 --> 37:12.060
In their defense, a third my therapist tells me a third of an apology is a commitment to

37:12.060 --> 37:15.620
change. How do you how do you commit to change? You know, it was either that or we promised

37:15.620 --> 37:24.540
not to hit your next cat. Yeah, we will not hit your next cat. I left my house once to

37:24.540 --> 37:31.980
go out and play. And these are just all going to be sad childhood stories. Yeah. And I played

37:31.980 --> 37:37.420
what do you do in an empty warehouse? You know, we don't want to bring out our fucking blue

37:37.420 --> 37:45.860
chip roast material. Dean Martin drinks, ladies and gentlemen. There were a couple victories

37:45.860 --> 37:53.620
in life, though. I ran I ran I ran I ran out into the into the neighborhood and played

37:53.620 --> 37:59.820
for several hours and came home and and my mom was waiting at the porch and she said,

37:59.820 --> 38:05.380
do you remember me telling you as you left to bring the kitten inside? So we had a new

38:05.380 --> 38:14.780
kitten and it was it was on a leash to let it play outside on a collar. And then and

38:14.780 --> 38:23.580
I said, no, I don't remember. Still don't remember mom instruction. I'll take your word

38:23.580 --> 38:37.300
for it. But it's not going to bring Mr. T back. I don't think it was Mr. T that died.

38:37.300 --> 38:46.220
But it apparently there was a tomato tower in the garden next to the front door and it

38:46.220 --> 38:55.460
was on this long like kind of just leash line like a lightweight clothes line kind of thing

38:55.460 --> 39:01.020
that was like long enough to let it like explore and play. And he loved tomatoes and he loved

39:01.020 --> 39:06.380
walking in circles around the perimeter of tomato towers and didn't wasn't a primate.

39:06.380 --> 39:12.900
So did not have the thought of doing the opposite of what you've been doing when it gets hard

39:12.900 --> 39:19.380
to breathe. So it just kept apparently it just hung itself just like and my mom informed

39:19.380 --> 39:26.220
me of this. I didn't have to come home to it. But I did have to hear the story and definitely

39:26.220 --> 39:32.620
the headline was that it was my fault. You should have. Yeah, I do like the style choice

39:32.620 --> 39:38.500
of ask the question. Do you remember when I told you to bring the cat in? Oh, you don't

39:38.500 --> 39:44.620
remember. Well, that explains why the cat's dead. It's kind of a it's a pretty clever

39:44.620 --> 39:49.820
tactic. Yeah. It's like because because it'd be like if it'd be like yeah, I do remember

39:49.820 --> 39:54.620
she if she was making it up. She'd be like, Oh, sweet. Fuck it. And then you should have

39:54.620 --> 39:58.780
done it mother fucker because you killed your cat. And then she'd be like she'd go into

39:58.780 --> 40:07.460
a room like whoa. Fuck. In your defense, he could have been dead before she asked you

40:07.460 --> 40:10.620
to bring, you know, he could have been there from the day before. I don't know when the

40:10.620 --> 40:13.940
last time was. Yeah, well, I don't remember. I don't know the time. Well, I don't think

40:13.940 --> 40:18.060
we weren't really good. We're not like hillbillies. We didn't like leave our cat out for two days

40:18.060 --> 40:21.980
and not know. It was just like it was like a rare thing to like. Yeah, you know, it's

40:21.980 --> 40:30.040
like we weren't it was but this thing is I don't remember. I don't fuck mom. No, I don't

40:30.040 --> 40:35.420
remember that. You're grown. Yeah, I don't fucking 44. I've been trying to remember it

40:35.420 --> 40:40.860
my whole life. You know what? I don't fucking remember you saying that cat would fuck you.

40:40.860 --> 40:45.860
I want to know what a tomato tower is. It's like a is it the little pyramid thing that

40:45.860 --> 40:53.580
you it's like a more like a cylinder. I would say, you know, with a slightly wire. Yeah,

40:53.580 --> 40:58.260
it's why it's a wire cylinder. Yeah, like a slight. It's not quite a true cylinder because

40:58.260 --> 41:02.900
the top is a little lesser diameter than the bottom. It's kind of like a Tower of Pisa

41:02.900 --> 41:09.420
kind of. That's not accurate. But but like it's like a tomato tower, tomato towers. I

41:09.420 --> 41:16.620
guess the idea is that the tomato will get born and then grab the tower. And I guess

41:16.620 --> 41:20.340
the idea is that you don't want your kitten to do that. You don't want it to like cling

41:20.340 --> 41:26.780
to the tower the way a tomato does. They don't make kitten towers. Nope. Nope. Maybe at the

41:26.780 --> 41:34.060
Humane Society, they have they have an array of those in the back. Come on back here, guys.

41:34.060 --> 41:40.020
Here's some tomato towers. Have a blast. We'll be back in 10 minutes. They'll all be dead.

41:40.020 --> 41:47.380
We we we love our pets. We love animals. We love our innocent dogs and cats. We we are

41:47.380 --> 41:54.940
able to touch emotions when we think about them that we are not able to access when we

41:54.940 --> 42:09.300
think about human beings. Give me a beat. Yo, this goes out to all the pets I killed. Sorry,

42:09.300 --> 42:15.140
Rover. Sorry muffin. Sorry. Sorry that about all the stuff in that I let you eat a choke

42:15.140 --> 42:24.980
on to death. Sorry. Sorry, Beth, about the cat that I shot with my BB gun through the

42:24.980 --> 42:35.980
eye. Why I'm associated path to be a serial killer, but I don't have bravery or a support

42:35.980 --> 42:43.580
system. Jeffrey Dahmer is in the house tonight. Clean out that crawl space play with the bones

42:43.580 --> 42:52.140
tonight. Squirrel bones, chipmunk bones, decapitated heads, Ed Kemper in effect, fucked his mother's

42:52.140 --> 43:02.820
head after her death. Cut her head off just to make her stop talking. Turn her off. Man,

43:02.820 --> 43:12.380
mindhunter. Cruelty to animals. It's the number one sign according to the FBI that you're

43:12.380 --> 43:17.940
going to have make people die when you become a person that's grown up. So don't let your

43:17.940 --> 43:24.980
kids torture your pups. Take them to the therapist. Say, fix this bitch. Don't wait to stitch

43:24.980 --> 43:31.380
nine stitches instead of doing a stitch in time. A stitch in time saves nine with the

43:31.380 --> 43:37.500
sociopath. Put that kid in the bath. Hold their head down. Maybe drown your kid. Might

43:37.500 --> 43:43.300
save a couple hundred people's kids. If your kid's already dumb and you know that, then

43:43.300 --> 43:58.060
just take your thumb and put it over their trachea and push until you hear a pop. If

43:58.060 --> 44:08.460
you think it's going to be a murderer, otherwise don't kill your kid. Yo, but here's what

44:08.460 --> 44:15.980
MC Lycoris did. Yo, I'm MC Lycoris. What I did was kind of ridiculous. I started a shelter

44:15.980 --> 44:22.780
for wayward youth, children at risk. This is what we do. We make them play foosball and

44:22.780 --> 44:27.340
weaves baskets and go to the mall and we take them to the zoo and say, look at those lions

44:27.340 --> 44:32.540
and they don't grow up to be death trying. They grow up to be lawyers and doctors and

44:32.540 --> 44:37.980
they work for Gamble and they work for Proctor. My name is MC Lycoris and I took a proactive

44:37.980 --> 44:46.300
stance, tried to turn shit around. Way to high road me. MC Lycoris. Sorry, I wasn't

44:46.300 --> 44:53.500
as fucking optimistic as you. I don't believe half the shit you just said. Why don't you

44:53.500 --> 44:58.020
come over here instead? Try talking that shit to me instead of behind my back. Does it seem

44:58.020 --> 45:02.940
like it's behind your back? Fucking idiot. It's the microphone. Oh shit. Tough guy when

45:02.940 --> 45:24.460
you're alone. Alright, I'm coming over there. Oh shit. Let me go, Jackson. Fuck you, fuck

45:24.460 --> 45:32.340
you. We just had an awkward fight. My shirts are all stretched to the right. Big collars

45:32.340 --> 45:38.300
both turned out to fight like pussies. It's both, it's embarrassing for both of us. MC

45:38.300 --> 45:51.100
Lycoris and me, Stan Schmengel, sociopathic, non serial killer, animal torturer. I'll tell

45:51.100 --> 45:56.140
you about the time that I took a knife and I threatened a giraffe for its life. I said,

45:56.140 --> 46:00.300
give me your wallet or stoop down. He said, I got too long a neck. I'm not going to clown

46:00.300 --> 46:05.100
around. I got to eat leaves that are way up high. I said, motherfucking giraffe, now you're

46:05.100 --> 46:08.620
gonna die. Give me, give me all your money. He said, I don't have none. I said, that's

46:08.620 --> 46:13.860
right, son. That's right, son. You're a broke-ass giraffe because I'm a primate and I'll tell

46:13.860 --> 46:20.820
you what I do. I lift weights in the penitentiary just to get strong. I didn't spend too long

46:20.820 --> 46:29.740
ribby rehabilitating. I just came in the safari. I'm going to fucking rob wild game. It's what

46:29.740 --> 46:38.020
I do. Rhinos, give me your money. Okay. Oh God. Yeah. No, why did I think that rap wouldn't

46:38.020 --> 46:41.900
be horrible and dark when I said, give me a beat after talking about animal cruelty.

46:41.900 --> 46:47.500
They got a little bit dark. I didn't, I never have shot an animal with a BB gun in case anyone

46:47.500 --> 46:51.100
thinks that's how freestyling works. Certainly not. You would have been a great serial killer.

46:51.100 --> 46:55.240
I've never been cruel to an animal. If you had some support. Yeah. That was my favorite

46:55.240 --> 47:03.340
line. You did bring up a good point also about cruelty to animals being such an indicator

47:03.340 --> 47:09.980
for future sociopathic tendencies. It seems like if you are a person that is cruel to

47:09.980 --> 47:13.340
an animal, they should just put you in jail. That would save so many human lives. Yeah.

47:13.340 --> 47:17.700
Yeah. I mean, how many times did you hear when you were a kid with some asshole in the

47:17.700 --> 47:20.140
neighborhood that like did some fucked up thing to a cat or something and like bragged

47:20.140 --> 47:23.500
about it? Because it's like they can't help but brag about it. And it's like they don't

47:23.500 --> 47:29.700
all become serial killers, but they definitely like that's just because they don't like whatever

47:29.700 --> 47:34.780
it's like they're what if you, because it doesn't even matter what your stance is about

47:34.780 --> 47:40.940
animals. Like like whether you're PETA full blown, like no animals should ever be hurt

47:40.940 --> 47:46.260
and you know, the eggs you ate this morning are a crime and stuff or if you're like way

47:46.260 --> 47:50.340
over on the other side and are like, no, if it's not a cuddly adorable dog, I don't give

47:50.340 --> 47:55.020
a fuck about animals or even if you're like the kind of person like like hates cats and

47:55.020 --> 48:00.220
shit. Like people that are just like they torture animals like they like they like they they

48:00.220 --> 48:05.340
do shit to cats and stuff like where they like they fuck with them like just to fuck

48:05.340 --> 48:06.340
with them.

48:06.340 --> 48:12.340
But why not just lock those people up? Yeah. Yeah, it does seem to be an indicator. Because

48:12.340 --> 48:17.340
it's like what do you what do you do? Like who why would you? Why would you have fun

48:17.340 --> 48:23.100
doing that? Yeah, that's the thing is we sort of if you merge the two, like being disrespectful

48:23.100 --> 48:28.980
to women and animals, there's this whole culture that we kind of got to rethink violence. Because

48:28.980 --> 48:32.580
I think I think we got lazy with it and we were sort of like, well, that's violent, but

48:32.580 --> 48:36.380
that's not violent. This is OK to watch and this is OK to show. And we're sort of at a

48:36.380 --> 48:40.620
place where it looks like we might want to look at all of that again. And that that might

48:40.620 --> 48:45.900
be one of the first things we do is be like animals. Let's start with animals and work

48:45.900 --> 48:52.340
our way up to humans through women. Yeah, is what we're applying because it's wrong.

48:52.340 --> 48:59.860
Yeah. Yeah. Where are we? Where are we headed? I think my optimistic view of it is that we

48:59.860 --> 49:05.740
are rototilling the fabric of society right now. Like we're yeah, that's the theory I've

49:05.740 --> 49:10.700
I've heard other people mention also, which I just jackhammering the concrete. And it's

49:10.700 --> 49:15.300
like, of course, that's not going to feel comfortable or or even righteous. Sometimes

49:15.300 --> 49:22.060
it's going to just feel insane. And every day, someone says, All right, that's enough.

49:22.060 --> 49:26.540
You know, because it's a friend of theirs or someone that's like what him? No, that's

49:26.540 --> 49:32.380
enough. Or this specific story is like, Well, if that's all right, that's enough. But and

49:32.380 --> 49:37.780
I know, I know, yeah, I think it's just like a jackhammering of the of the concrete and

49:37.780 --> 49:46.300
then and then hopefully then if we could just observe what we're doing that that instead

49:46.300 --> 49:53.980
of there being a backlash that maybe this is the ticket to Oh, we start to adopt a code

49:53.980 --> 50:02.500
and a principle where we go. I okay, I I subscribe to the sort of equivalent of the Asimov rules

50:02.500 --> 50:07.780
of robotics or something. There's like a there's like a lost three rules, a litmus test, you

50:07.780 --> 50:13.700
can you can rattle off before you have a human encounter, whatever it is. And you got like,

50:13.700 --> 50:17.620
Okay, so who's harming who or who's getting away with I don't know, there's some like

50:17.620 --> 50:23.820
code and that's like a religion that that comes up out of it, where it's not about

50:23.820 --> 50:29.460
men versus women or people of color versus white people or whatever it like stops being

50:29.460 --> 50:36.060
that because it becomes so chaotic and it becomes so like what Mr. Rogers did that? Oh, no. And

50:36.060 --> 50:41.980
like, like, like all of these heroes are funny people are tumbling and there's all this like

50:41.980 --> 50:48.140
crazy shit. So we're all so confused that we all cry out at once for order. We go give

50:48.140 --> 50:53.380
us then tell us what to do tell us how to think. Tell me something to tattoo on my

50:53.380 --> 50:59.460
arms so that I can just look at it give me a symbol of shamrock or a or a circle with

50:59.460 --> 51:05.780
three dots on it or something that could represent like the three acid tests of whether or not

51:05.780 --> 51:10.860
you're good or evil and then there's and then it can just be about people that subscribe

51:10.860 --> 51:15.740
to that belief system versus people that don't. Because the belief system I have built into

51:15.740 --> 51:20.700
it as does animal cruelty, like a kind of like, Well, why would you bother fighting

51:20.700 --> 51:24.900
this? Like, and then there would be people going like, I don't believe in that that circle

51:24.900 --> 51:31.420
was two dots thing. Why? Well, no one told you to get the tattoo. But why don't you?

51:31.420 --> 51:37.740
Why are you? Why are you so scared about that? What's what slippery slope is there for you?

51:37.740 --> 51:42.380
And then those and then we could just like, just choke those people to death, put them

51:42.380 --> 51:43.380
in prison.

51:43.380 --> 51:47.340
The Al Franken thing is sort of something that you just said, which was that when they

51:47.340 --> 51:52.140
find out Mr. Rogers has done something weird, and it's so frustrating to hear people sort

51:52.140 --> 51:56.620
of defend him because you're at this point where you're like, the world assumed that

51:56.620 --> 52:01.380
only people you didn't like, right, be found guilty. And it's sort of a wake up call to

52:01.380 --> 52:05.700
say it's going to be guys that you like. Yeah, it's going to be people you love fathers and

52:05.700 --> 52:08.980
brothers. And we have to say we have the same standard.

52:08.980 --> 52:13.380
Yeah, and what I mean, I'm sure there's like Al Franken's the Al Franken story is getting

52:13.380 --> 52:17.740
pretty close to I'm pretty sure like within 10 years, like, I don't think there's a there's

52:17.740 --> 52:21.900
probably not a photo you could dig up of me like honking some titties but like and I don't

52:21.900 --> 52:29.380
I don't think I ever like, right, but I just I just it's in terms of it's like, well, I

52:29.380 --> 52:34.700
would expect that sooner or later, if we were going to like, like put a black light over

52:34.700 --> 52:39.820
my entire life, 40 years that there's got to be some narrative where I'm like way out

52:39.820 --> 52:45.940
of line in my past. And I've I'm I'm definitely not pretending to not remember like I don't

52:45.940 --> 52:51.260
I don't know if you know, but what I do know is that if there was if there was some like,

52:51.260 --> 52:55.780
if someone said something, it was like, Oh, yeah, I was doing a show with Dan Harmon and

52:55.780 --> 53:00.500
he blah, blah, blah, and he did this and that. And I would go if it was true, they would

53:00.500 --> 53:06.420
go, Okay, yeah, that's true. And I that was fucked up. Yeah, I've been I either it was

53:06.420 --> 53:09.340
just reminded of that because of the story or I've been thinking about that for a long

53:09.340 --> 53:13.900
time. And I should I'm really embarrassed about that. But why isn't that basically how Al

53:13.900 --> 53:19.300
Franken responded? Like, like, I don't know if his apology was like, suitable or whatever.

53:19.300 --> 53:24.100
But what's the big, you know, it's like, if you if you didn't actually, it's it should

53:24.100 --> 53:30.460
be okay for there to just be like, Oh, yeah, by the way, here's some like shit sprayed

53:30.460 --> 53:39.300
on you. Here's a little die pack on you from 2005. And you should be able to go Yep, sorry.

53:39.300 --> 53:45.260
And the key is evolution in that if we found something about you in 1998, and then we you

53:45.260 --> 53:50.620
were still doing it in 2006, sort of like in a Louis situation, I think then people are

53:50.620 --> 53:55.260
angry. But if we find out that when you were 18, you were inappropriate. But now as a grown

53:55.260 --> 53:59.460
ass man, there's never been a case again against you. Then we see that you've evolved. And I

53:59.460 --> 54:03.420
think that's what people are asking for. That's the I think that's the thing that separates

54:03.420 --> 54:04.420
cases.

54:04.420 --> 54:08.900
I think the crucial things are cover up dishonesty, stuff like that. Like, yeah, if there's a

54:08.900 --> 54:13.780
trail of like, no, I'm gonna, yeah, I'm gonna keep doing this and I'm gonna lie about it

54:13.780 --> 54:19.140
or like, if it comes forward, and then the person's response is like, that didn't happen,

54:19.140 --> 54:22.900
like, okay, then we have to and then it turns out it did happen. Then it's like, okay, but

54:22.900 --> 54:27.460
do you understand that you're that doesn't bode well, because you're not, that means

54:27.460 --> 54:31.860
that if you could get away with it, you would as opposed to like, Oh, did I do that? Urkel

54:31.860 --> 54:40.660
we call it the Urkel. Urkel effect. Just say, did I do that? Just remember Urkel, the Urkel

54:40.660 --> 54:46.420
principle. How do you spell Urkel? And then we'll make up like an acronym for the I yeah,

54:46.420 --> 54:51.940
I, I, I don't what, how did that come up? I don't know. Oh, the Al Franken thing, I guess.

54:51.940 --> 54:58.660
Yeah, because it's like, well, yeah, he's a senator. I think we should assume that all

54:58.660 --> 55:03.460
politicians are fucking creeps for sure, right? Yeah, there's gonna be a shake in your head.

55:03.460 --> 55:09.540
Oh, because of Maxine waters, you're so fucking racist. There's definitely Kamala Harris. I'm not

55:09.540 --> 55:16.980
racist. Oh, she's black too. There's definitely gonna be a ton of old white men in DC, like

55:16.980 --> 55:21.860
they get fucking purged from this. I mean, on both sides, I'm sure, you know, I mean, it just

55:21.860 --> 55:29.300
should be no shock to anybody that a senator of any state, I know that should not be okay. And

55:29.300 --> 55:33.780
I'm glad it's no longer okay. And we should expect that every single fucking one of them is going

55:33.780 --> 55:39.060
to have somebody come forward and say, like, yeah, because people with power, my therapist said,

55:40.100 --> 55:46.900
she's a she's a married lesbian. And she said, does she watch the show? No, I don't think so.

55:46.900 --> 55:52.180
If she does, she's smart enough to pretend she doesn't. But because then I think it'd feel

55:52.180 --> 55:57.860
like it would ding our therapy or something. But she uses family guy references to like make

55:57.860 --> 56:02.100
her points. She's like, sometimes Peter Griffin has like an angel on his shoulder. Yeah, and I'm

56:02.100 --> 56:10.180
like, I have a cartoon you could use. I know. That is hilarious. I would love to see your face when

56:10.180 --> 56:17.140
she says it's exact. I'm like, Yeah, great. As I said, the third time she did a family guy

56:17.140 --> 56:20.660
reference, I was like, Are you trying to like, we're going to have to have well, he's in comedy.

56:20.660 --> 56:24.500
He'll appreciate that I'm trying. I'm going to need to see you twice a week because of your

56:24.500 --> 56:31.380
references are fucking me up like my it's like, like, when do I get some validation? I get it.

56:31.380 --> 56:36.740
I should let go of the need for that. But like, do you have to wait until she starts to talk about

56:36.740 --> 56:40.740
it like she doesn't know you're associated with it? Just you should have seen on Rick and Morty.

56:40.740 --> 56:44.660
Do you watch that show anyway, Dan? You should have seen on Rick and Morty.

56:44.660 --> 56:50.740
But she said, she said, listen, it's power. It's the studies and the anecdotal evidence show,

56:50.740 --> 56:57.940
even in the psychological community, like women who are not only women, but they work in the shrink

56:58.500 --> 57:05.860
industry. There's still ways to become empowered as a person to the point where your mind starts

57:05.860 --> 57:14.020
to bend in you. And it just happens less because women are because we've we've gasoled them into

57:14.020 --> 57:18.180
like they don't get as many chances to be in such power that they can like find out.

57:19.380 --> 57:23.380
She's saying it's human. Yeah, it's like, it's a person in power thing. I'm still,

57:23.380 --> 57:28.900
I don't totally, I don't think it's like a split equal thing. I think it's going to take decades

57:28.900 --> 57:35.700
to convince me that guys aren't like like neurologically like like more fucked up, like just like like

57:36.340 --> 57:45.700
I just seem but but I do believe her when she says like anybody that gets a ton of power over

57:45.700 --> 57:49.620
another human being like there's all that you have to go into that situation with your

57:49.620 --> 57:54.260
shit together that is not going to bring your shit together in that situation. So there's just

57:54.260 --> 57:59.380
like a big, you know, there's syndromes of like powerful women that will just like psychologically

57:59.380 --> 58:04.820
torture the dudes underneath them, you know, like, like, like, I think it's probably a smarter and

58:04.820 --> 58:09.780
more awesome kind of sexist that when we think about it, we go like that would be awesome.

58:10.660 --> 58:19.460
But anyways, I why did that come up because you'd said Kamala Harris, she's actually her

58:19.460 --> 58:27.220
oh yeah so so that's why that's why I'm saying like all like all senators we should just explain

58:27.220 --> 58:32.900
there's no there's no harm that can come from assuming that all senators are liars thieves.

58:34.340 --> 58:40.580
It is not our patriotic duty to think that someone in office is a good person or honorable like

58:40.580 --> 58:46.180
it is arguably a patriotic duty is to be skeptical and assume the worst about our

58:46.180 --> 58:52.580
servants you know. Do you think that this will swing around on Trump or will they just continue

58:52.580 --> 58:57.220
to say that happened a long time then that's not true? I don't know. I don't know how that

58:57.220 --> 59:00.500
I don't know if they it's like this elephant around well somebody was mentioning that it's like

59:00.500 --> 59:06.980
it did him tweeting about how Franken made blood so crazy but also tweeting about it like like

59:06.980 --> 59:11.540
a little poopy boy like it was like oh guess where his hands would have pictured two and three

59:11.540 --> 59:18.020
it was like he's okay bad it bad it bad it being a billionaire we knew that bad it being president

59:18.020 --> 59:21.860
bad it and then it turned out we were kind of marveling at wow he's bad at being Hitler

59:21.860 --> 59:29.140
wow that's a relief he's being bad at being Hitler. I never expected he'd be bad at sexual

59:29.140 --> 59:33.620
harassment like bad at bad at parsing a titty honk photo I was like do you think it's a he

59:33.620 --> 59:37.620
thinks it's a missing he thinks there's it's a beginning of a slide show yeah there's a whole

59:37.620 --> 59:43.540
though he's like bad at being a douchebag like he's bad at looking at that photo and just going

59:43.540 --> 59:50.340
oh looks like he got the dudes he's like he's like I mean it's like there's a couple ways to

59:50.340 --> 59:56.900
interpret his response one is that he looked at that photo and was like okay fine but you know

59:56.900 --> 01:00:02.100
that shit got bad in the subsequent photos like that he because he didn't look at it as a bad thing

01:00:02.740 --> 01:00:07.220
yes because in his world he's used to getting busted for so much more he's like if that was

01:00:07.220 --> 01:00:13.700
number one god knows what two through five are the other the other way to interpret it is that he

01:00:13.700 --> 01:00:21.060
got a hard on and was just sharing it with America it was just going like whoa look at that like

01:00:21.700 --> 01:00:29.700
did all of his did all of his accusers just get paid off like how did that all just go away I don't

01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:38.260
know I don't know I all I know is that people are you know when people say oh but what about this guy

01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:43.220
I was like well let him run their their sexual predator guy like why are we trying to like

01:00:43.220 --> 01:00:47.300
pull him out of the race and all this stuff like like if you pull him out of the race then they've

01:00:47.300 --> 01:00:51.940
they've already learned that you know it's neck and neck with a pedophile running so just get a

01:00:51.940 --> 01:00:57.620
find a non pedophile they like they would love them for him to be disqualified that's a do over

01:00:57.620 --> 01:01:02.580
so I was I was making that argument like just just run your pedophile like like like and and

01:01:02.580 --> 01:01:07.380
they're like yeah and then and then he's gonna win I'm like well then let the games begin yeah you

01:01:07.380 --> 01:01:12.020
know like like I know that there's this bigger chess game like where oh we got a topple the we

01:01:12.020 --> 01:01:18.100
got to get the majority but that's how they're thinking so much that they're running a pedophile

01:01:18.100 --> 01:01:25.140
so let's like it's not like oh be Christ like and just let them run the game but when it's when

01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:29.300
it's that when there's that much tumble to the point where they're like banging shoes on the table

01:01:29.300 --> 01:01:36.740
saying like you know it like it's like okay there's a there's a larger loss here for them yeah yeah

01:01:36.740 --> 01:01:41.300
yeah I think they should right they should be forced to run that guy like what like why should that

01:01:41.300 --> 01:01:45.940
I mean obviously it they don't have to see them once he wins the election yeah I mean

01:01:45.940 --> 01:01:54.420
you just yeah I think that how bad would it be to lose to the pedophile to be the fucking

01:01:55.620 --> 01:02:00.980
I mean that's your claim to fame hey yeah particularly because I lost to the pedophile

01:02:00.980 --> 01:02:05.860
in Alabama he's the lawyer that went after the people who killed the four girls in a church

01:02:05.860 --> 01:02:10.420
yeah they were blown out of so that that even sends a larger message the fact that it's neck and neck

01:02:10.420 --> 01:02:14.900
yeah it's terrifying I don't think it's neck and neck anymore not anymore but it's it was eight points

01:02:14.900 --> 01:02:19.940
three days ago now we're up to four points back oh really so it's these are also poles in Alabama

01:02:19.940 --> 01:02:25.140
these are like phone poles what kind of idiot is picking up their landline in Alabama you know

01:02:25.140 --> 01:02:32.340
Tammy sessions yeah hello we saw the headline that said that oh god it was some statistic about like

01:02:35.060 --> 01:02:39.460
I'm pulling this number out of my ass but it was like the actual numbers I'm pulling on my ass but

01:02:39.460 --> 01:02:49.300
so but it was like six out of ten evangelicals in Alabama say that now that they know about this

01:02:49.300 --> 01:02:55.460
they're they're they're sending their endorsement no they want to vote for them twice or whatever

01:02:55.460 --> 01:02:59.460
that it was like that they're doubling down however they express that that they're more likely to vote

01:03:00.020 --> 01:03:04.580
for them now like how is there even a degree was that a continuum like now I'm more likely to vote

01:03:04.580 --> 01:03:10.980
for one of two people the the where it's a binary decision between whether I'm in my mind whether

01:03:10.980 --> 01:03:15.700
I'm good or evil now I'm more likely to double down the most brilliant move would like talking

01:03:15.700 --> 01:03:23.620
about playing chess was the robocall thing of like oh let's have a fake Jew from the Washington Post

01:03:23.620 --> 01:03:32.820
calling in like murking around looking for more dirt on him just to sully the whole yeah media

01:03:32.820 --> 01:03:37.060
you know just to like just to fan the flames of resentment I didn't hear about that it was a

01:03:37.060 --> 01:03:43.940
fake it was a false flag robocall it was a it was a robocall in Alabama a real robocall that

01:03:43.940 --> 01:03:49.700
went out and it was you got to hear it it's it's amazing it's uh it's uh yeah this is uh it's a

01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:55.540
recording you know it's like oh this is a Bernie Bernstein from the Washington Post and I'm looking

01:03:55.540 --> 01:04:02.020
for some information about about what's his name about the fucking you know whoever I forgot the

01:04:02.020 --> 01:04:07.780
guy's name and they're like if you have any tips no questions ask I pay five thousand dollars call

01:04:07.780 --> 01:04:15.380
this number blah blah blah like just so that just to muddy the water so that people are are confused

01:04:15.380 --> 01:04:21.860
about whether or not that's real and whether or not the process of finding that information is

01:04:21.860 --> 01:04:28.660
and just to throw doubt on whether or not any of that information is real right right most people

01:04:28.660 --> 01:04:34.020
said things like I don't know about the timing yeah the timing's kind of weird yeah yeah it's

01:04:34.020 --> 01:04:38.740
weird that it would come up right now yeah yeah wait what do you mean the timing of finding out

01:04:38.740 --> 01:04:43.940
that these allocate that these allegations from all these women from or from like 40 years ago

01:04:43.940 --> 01:04:47.940
and this guy's had a long career you know right so they're saying like why would it come up now

01:04:47.940 --> 01:04:53.300
that seems weird to them uh and you know they're not taking into account that there could be

01:04:53.300 --> 01:05:00.180
this movement going on where right and they feel empowered or emboldened to speak out and to speak

01:05:00.180 --> 01:05:05.940
up and they didn't before right yeah also the cover-up was 40 years well I didn't know it was

01:05:05.940 --> 01:05:10.580
under that's so weird like it would be like yeah who gives a shit if it's politically motivated to

01:05:10.580 --> 01:05:15.860
come forward right let's say well that's such a great excuse like oh it's politically it's

01:05:15.860 --> 01:05:20.260
politically those are my political enemies like true yes they are your political enemies of course

01:05:20.260 --> 01:05:28.020
that that's how that works the job that you want yeah and the audience is going crazy well

01:05:28.020 --> 01:05:34.340
you know you gotta most people are just listening to this they're working out it's like a regular

01:05:34.340 --> 01:05:40.100
podcast they're at the gym yeah the subscribers get the treat of it's kind of like a Neil

01:05:40.100 --> 01:05:45.380
hamburger you kind of bit like like there's no audience so it feels like just awkward enough

01:05:45.380 --> 01:05:48.900
I didn't mean that the audience listening is going crazy I was joking about the

01:05:48.900 --> 01:05:51.220
people the live audience here yeah yeah

01:05:53.300 --> 01:06:00.180
you know I cardboard cutouts of people somebody did once suggest that we fill it with mannequins

01:06:00.180 --> 01:06:02.340
and then said that Dan would not be able to concentrate

01:06:04.580 --> 01:06:05.460
shout out to ready

01:06:08.260 --> 01:06:12.660
yeah I what it's that's another exciting thing about all this like you know allegations and

01:06:12.660 --> 01:06:17.780
all this stuff is like unless and I assume we're not going to start kink shaming right because

01:06:17.780 --> 01:06:22.740
especially like if you're it's like I kind of like I never set out to be a hero by jerking

01:06:22.740 --> 01:06:27.300
off on a mannequin leg but because that's a victimless crime I'm kind of like an accidental

01:06:27.300 --> 01:06:32.500
like that happened Arthur here like let's go and bring those six legs out for their testimony

01:06:32.500 --> 01:06:37.140
right now like I just happened to that's that's the other thing I want to be careful about that's

01:06:37.140 --> 01:06:40.820
why I've been like careful careful to let go like well let's talk about the silence and let's

01:06:40.820 --> 01:06:43.780
guys let's take account about the way we're treating women and all that stuff because

01:06:43.780 --> 01:06:47.860
I don't want because otherwise I'm in the catbird seat and I didn't want to be because I didn't

01:06:47.860 --> 01:06:52.100
shoot that's not by choice that's like that's no more by choice than if I was born like gay or

01:06:52.100 --> 01:06:56.500
something like that like my proclivities don't happen to involve like uh

01:06:57.780 --> 01:07:04.660
like like living people yeah like well I mean but they I'm not you know but I mean I they do

01:07:04.660 --> 01:07:09.460
they have my proclivities involved my living girlfriend Cody but but I I I just mean like I

01:07:09.460 --> 01:07:17.220
don't like I it just a youtube video goes so far you know like it doesn't I never really I don't

01:07:17.220 --> 01:07:23.540
have the biology I don't think that results in like being so frustrated with a woman for not letting

01:07:23.540 --> 01:07:28.820
you assault her that you have to jerk off in a potted plant like while she watches just to

01:07:28.820 --> 01:07:34.660
just to get your life back but whenever anything that involves like coming craving and all that

01:07:34.660 --> 01:07:42.340
stuff I'm always like even though it's like really easy to vilify the the creepy people like I know

01:07:42.340 --> 01:07:47.540
like I'm creepy you know like I'm just not I just don't happen to be creepy in a way that like

01:07:47.540 --> 01:07:51.300
would ever bring me into an intersection where somebody else was getting hurt without their

01:07:51.300 --> 01:07:56.180
consent but I I don't think that's I don't think that's because I'm a noble person I think that's

01:07:56.180 --> 01:08:02.340
because I like saw some pantyhose feet under the table when I was 10 years old in the 70s or something

01:08:02.340 --> 01:08:11.220
and like I don't so I it's so I'm like because I don't want it would be just like so easy to just

01:08:11.220 --> 01:08:18.020
go like oh yeah let's let's let's let's find all the all the worst people and let's like let's get

01:08:18.020 --> 01:08:25.140
rid of them but it's not really it's like you can find monsters if you look for monsters like you'll

01:08:25.140 --> 01:08:29.460
just find them but I don't think that'll I think if you could wave a magic wand and get rid of every

01:08:29.460 --> 01:08:33.620
guy that ever heard a person I don't think that would solve the problem but also people are

01:08:34.500 --> 01:08:42.260
complex and no one is everyone has bad shit about them and and you know not everyone that is being

01:08:43.220 --> 01:08:47.060
I mean different yeah not to not to tie it back to what we were talking about but uh

01:08:48.100 --> 01:08:52.260
you know all of those people are still going to be in society and living and like they were charged

01:08:52.260 --> 01:08:58.820
with whatever sexual misconduct or sexual assault or like they have families and kids and they love

01:08:58.820 --> 01:09:02.660
their kids and you know they just people sometimes I'm not defending any of those people but I'm

01:09:02.660 --> 01:09:10.100
saying that people are complicated and good people do bad things and so how do we deal with that you

01:09:10.100 --> 01:09:16.900
know yeah we have to make this about like how do we how do we fix society not if we if we it'll be

01:09:16.900 --> 01:09:22.820
the easy way out to make it into a okay got this one that one that one that one just some symbolic

01:09:22.820 --> 01:09:29.380
bullshit yeah because for for a couple reasons one is like just your classic scientific reason

01:09:29.380 --> 01:09:35.460
which is like the same reason your doctor tells you you got to finish these uh antibiotics you

01:09:35.460 --> 01:09:39.620
can't just take them until you don't have the sniffles anymore and then throw them in the garbage

01:09:39.620 --> 01:09:44.580
you got to keep taking them after you feel good because you're if you're if there's a couple left

01:09:44.580 --> 01:09:51.380
they're just gonna be really good at being making you sick so the metaphor there is like do we really

01:09:51.380 --> 01:09:58.260
want to just find the Weinsteins hang them from the highest tree and then what's left oh the

01:09:59.460 --> 01:10:05.860
the super secret agent predators that like never get caught the Kevin Costner's in Mr Mr

01:10:06.580 --> 01:10:13.940
Mr Pottery Lacker what's that movie Mr Brooks the Mr Brooks is out there will remain you know

01:10:13.940 --> 01:10:22.900
watching the Weinstein corpse swaying and they'll be like okay back to work with my Jeff Daniels

01:10:24.020 --> 01:10:34.260
or William Hurt Tyler Durden in my SUV guiding me you know you want to come on come on you know

01:10:46.980 --> 01:10:53.860
for the fucking like accidental rich little that I am like I'll just think aside I can I can do I

01:10:53.860 --> 01:11:00.100
can do a perfect impression of any celebrity once I'll never be able to do William Hurt ever again

01:11:00.100 --> 01:11:05.780

up with it I see that's the thing I did it once right one more time I can't do it try it again

01:11:45.380 --> 01:11:52.100
sword and scale sword and scale sword and scale contains violence and adult themes

01:11:52.100 --> 01:12:02.660
sword and scale contains violence and adult themes now I'm Aaron Mankey and this is lore

01:12:06.340 --> 01:12:07.300
podcast impressions

01:12:09.700 --> 01:12:17.860
Karina Longworth had something interesting to say about Otto Preminger this

01:12:17.860 --> 01:12:28.180
is the story of MGM and Charles Manson I was wondering if you could all try and do

01:12:28.740 --> 01:12:34.660
maybe a little bit of iraq laugh is Charles Manson about to die yes he already died

01:12:34.660 --> 01:12:40.820
it's close very close I hear people upset about that I seem upset I I the yeah the weird thing

01:12:40.820 --> 01:12:48.580
will be does Charles Manson by virtue of our culture's well justified penchant for irony

01:12:48.580 --> 01:12:56.260
and and going lateral or or correcting as we go will Charles Manson get a worse or better

01:12:56.260 --> 01:13:04.980
Viking funeral than Hugh Hefner like Hugh Hefner got fucking blasted like he he he lived 15 years

01:13:04.980 --> 01:13:12.740
too long like if he had died 15 years ago which so many people that knew him and and were in the

01:13:12.740 --> 01:13:18.500
same room with him argue that he did that he would have just been your usual like you know he

01:13:18.500 --> 01:13:24.740
would have gotten that eulogy to expect of like I was an iconoclast and a and a rebel

01:13:24.740 --> 01:13:30.180
millionaire that changed the culture blah blah blah it's like he just he hung on so long that he

01:13:30.180 --> 01:13:37.860
got to see like oh yeah see you later you fucking monster yeah I like wow hadn't he sold the mansion

01:13:37.860 --> 01:13:47.380
but was still living in the man he put the mansion up for sale with the odd caveat on the price tag

01:13:47.380 --> 01:13:53.140
that you that he was allowed to live there till he died small contingency yeah and now the guy

01:13:53.140 --> 01:13:58.660
said he's gonna reunite both properties because it used to be one huge super mansion oh really

01:13:58.660 --> 01:14:03.380
not crazy I've never been there it seems to me like it would be a bummer of it like to like

01:14:03.380 --> 01:14:07.060
it's above their parties out there and it's gonna be the playboy mansion I'm always like

01:14:07.060 --> 01:14:14.020
that's fucking bummer it was a bummer yeah it was a bummer I was there once yeah it and I think it

01:14:14.020 --> 01:14:20.900
only smelled like mildew because it was raining and so they did something they don't normally have

01:14:20.900 --> 01:14:26.660
to do which is they because it was an outdoor on the lawn part at courtyard party or something and

01:14:26.660 --> 01:14:35.060
they had to unroll 10 awnings that I think just only they just rolled up since the last time it

01:14:35.060 --> 01:14:39.780
rained and so the whole place smelled like your grandpa's sleeping bag yeah yeah and the buffet

01:14:39.780 --> 01:14:48.260
was sort of weird looking sad kind of like bad hoteli did you get that uh yeah I mean but yeah

01:14:48.260 --> 01:14:56.820
Marlago more uh princess cruise lines just dark dark that's where my famous David Hasselhoff

01:14:56.820 --> 01:15:01.540
story takes place me and Schrab where we we harassed David Hasselhoff at the playboy mansion

01:15:01.540 --> 01:15:07.700
hilarious and uh yeah we walked up to him and and said we were just we were just high off our

01:15:07.700 --> 01:15:15.380
asses like and and we're like we have to talk to David Hasselhoff and we go uh hey uh we made

01:15:15.380 --> 01:15:20.180
we made a pilot it's about you it's inspired by you and he's like you made a pilot about me

01:15:20.980 --> 01:15:24.500
and we're talking about Heat Vision and Jack or like yeah I was directed by Ben Stiller and

01:15:24.500 --> 01:15:28.420
it was about it was it was called heatfishing a jack and it was kind of it's very inspired by

01:15:28.420 --> 01:15:33.620
by nightrider and so on and he's like Ben Stiller what else did he direct and and and

01:15:33.620 --> 01:15:41.940
and Schrab said uh Zoolander why that was from the I and and and then and then David Hasselhoff

01:15:41.940 --> 01:15:48.660
just like processing all of this like Cox's Hasselhead and then goes Zoolander's about me

01:15:49.540 --> 01:15:56.260
and then Schrab and I just like we're at his beat and we both went yes and then just walked away

01:15:56.260 --> 01:16:01.940
that's awesome I'm sure he might still think that yeah I mean that's where we're like we're like

01:16:01.940 --> 01:16:05.620
cracking up like we weren't trying to like punk him but we were just like we were too high to be

01:16:05.620 --> 01:16:10.020
talking to anybody much less we did a bad job so at least we turned that into a story and now

01:16:10.020 --> 01:16:14.660
the only the only real victim of this story is going to be a David Hasselhoff's lawyer

01:16:14.660 --> 01:16:19.540
because you know that guy got a 3am phone call like I want you to like look into the Zoolander

01:16:20.180 --> 01:16:27.140
more like Zoolander because I'm hearing that movie is about me. Hasselhoff like at every party

01:16:27.140 --> 01:16:33.540
has to endure like so many you know so many people like just stone like we have to talk to Hassel

01:16:33.540 --> 01:16:39.460
literally it's just a barrage of people like and and and fortunately for him um he's so hard to find

01:16:39.460 --> 01:16:44.980
in a crowd because he's only seven foot zero is he really he's so tall I mean it's like like Tim

01:16:44.980 --> 01:16:49.620
Robbins John Cousack David Hasselhoff they're like in a in an industry where everyone's shocked to

01:16:49.620 --> 01:16:55.540
find out that everyone's five foot three yeah like you and I are tall guys could get a relative to

01:16:55.540 --> 01:17:01.700
these like these tiny little fucking Kebler yeah tall house fucking Ben's tall house elves Ben's

01:17:01.700 --> 01:17:07.940
fun super tall as well Vince Vaughn yeah yeah he's tall Conan do you know anything about Hubel's

01:17:07.940 --> 01:17:13.300
new show no yeah I was I was I keep I keep planning to like thank you good good good good

01:17:13.300 --> 01:17:17.940
controlling oh I'm not worried about that Hubel what are you what are you plugging and may I

01:17:17.940 --> 01:17:23.540
congratulate you on your choice of venue to plug it oh yeah I mean I'm not plugging that hard

01:17:23.540 --> 01:17:31.220
yeah we made this show for YouTube red which is like a their new pay thing but uh but yeah it just

01:17:31.220 --> 01:17:35.380
came out it's called do you want to see a dead body oh yeah okay I heard I heard you talking about

01:17:35.380 --> 01:17:42.180
this on um uh on uh god damn it how did this get made yeah yeah and so it's basically we I used to

01:17:42.180 --> 01:17:49.140
do this bit on Funny or Die and we just expanded that into like a larger TV world where uh yeah I

01:17:49.140 --> 01:17:55.380
just take different comedians out to go find a fucking dead body somewhere is it is is it's sort

01:17:55.380 --> 01:18:03.300
of like are you accomplishing even ironically uh a like uh interview no you're going no that was

01:18:03.300 --> 01:18:07.860
what we thought about that was going to be the that was like our original idea was like oh it'll

01:18:07.860 --> 01:18:14.740
be like a talk show and I'll talk to them but uh no it's fully scripted so I play me and they play

01:18:14.740 --> 01:18:20.100
you know a weirdo version of them but it's always like it's very little about the body

01:18:20.100 --> 01:18:25.060
of you have you met our new running character uh tiny brandon

01:18:35.220 --> 01:18:38.020
did you think that no one was going to notice you like

01:18:41.780 --> 01:18:45.540
tiny brandon wait tiny brandon can you can you stick around a little while just

01:18:45.540 --> 01:18:53.700
okay um uh what I don't you were talking about the show about dead bodies

01:18:56.340 --> 01:19:04.260
tiny brandon uh do you uh are you worried about america you know I open up for Kevin Hart

01:19:05.380 --> 01:19:12.260
and well we're on tour I see a lot of different faces all so big I thought tiny brandon was a

01:19:12.260 --> 01:19:17.860
child I think he's he's he's an adult but he's mentally handicapped yeah I when I first saw him

01:19:17.860 --> 01:19:22.900
I thought it was like part of the Harmon babies uh thing we're launching where it's like all of us

01:19:22.900 --> 01:19:30.100
that are like but younger but no I think he's yeah I think he's yeah he's he's he's he's 48 and he's

01:19:30.100 --> 01:19:47.380
fucked up like there was a fuck up at the hospital okay thank you tiny brandon we won't

01:19:47.380 --> 01:19:52.980
keep you tiny brandon uh someone should make a t-shirt with tiny brandon someone someone'll

01:19:52.980 --> 01:19:58.820
do something like we've got some very talented fans what I miss hubel show hubel's talking about

01:19:58.820 --> 01:20:03.940
a show that's what I mean uh yeah but so it's basically just an excuse uh for me to hang out

01:20:03.940 --> 01:20:09.860
with that person but uh it's not like a reality show uh you know it's a scripted thing so supposedly

01:20:11.300 --> 01:20:16.420
famous people will drop whatever they're doing and come with me to go find a different dead body

01:20:16.420 --> 01:20:21.300
every episode so not all famous people because obviously like I I wasn't called uh no there was

01:20:21.300 --> 01:20:25.620
no way to to use every famous person in hollywood there's also so many famous people nowadays there's

01:20:25.620 --> 01:20:31.540
so many famous people um and I put famous in quotes but uh do you find a body sometimes we do

01:20:31.540 --> 01:20:38.020
sometimes we don't find a body sometimes the guest uh become like uh there's one with john

01:20:38.020 --> 01:20:43.540
show that starts out in five seconds into it he falls into a thing a quicksand and so the whole

01:20:43.540 --> 01:20:50.180
episode is me I run into town to buy some rope and then I just keep getting distracted and you

01:20:50.180 --> 01:20:54.660
know getting getting you know harangued into something else and then I keep coming back to

01:20:54.660 --> 01:20:58.500
him to give him an update and every time he's like lower and lower in the quicksand so then he becomes

01:20:58.500 --> 01:21:03.940
the body you know that's awesome so but uh and then there's like one with cordry where cordry

01:21:03.940 --> 01:21:08.100
starts taunting this big dog and someone's we're cutting through someone's backyard there's this

01:21:08.100 --> 01:21:12.260
big fucking mean dog and cordry starts like taunting it of course the dog breaks off his

01:21:12.260 --> 01:21:18.500
chain and the whole episode is us running full speed away from this murdering like very scary dog

01:21:18.500 --> 01:21:24.100
and uh so it's just dumb bits like that you know they're 15 minutes long super super easy

01:21:24.100 --> 01:21:28.260
and silly and it's like my favorite favorite thing I know this is a dumb question and I

01:21:28.260 --> 01:21:34.100
have a show with youtube red so I get asked this question and have no idea how to answer it but

01:21:34.100 --> 01:21:38.820
what the fuck yeah maybe other people know how to answer it maybe that's why they ask what what's

01:21:38.820 --> 01:21:45.300
it what was it like to work with me to read um I tell I've told everybody it's been really great

01:21:45.300 --> 01:21:51.220
uh because they let me do literally anything like literally anything they were just like

01:21:51.780 --> 01:21:56.020
super psych you know I think they're just kind of getting going with a lot of their shows and

01:21:56.020 --> 01:21:59.780
trying to get more people to come and do shows there so you know I think at the beginning

01:22:00.900 --> 01:22:05.700
you know like Netflix and amazon when they first started they're like how do we how do we get good

01:22:05.700 --> 01:22:11.300
people to come make shows here oh we don't fuck with them right so that was my experience um they

01:22:11.300 --> 01:22:19.460
were super cool to me um you know I I wish that they would run fucking commercials like on tv

01:22:19.460 --> 01:22:23.380
for it and stuff like that and but they're like no no no we're youtube we're gonna put it like all

01:22:23.380 --> 01:22:27.380
around youtube and I'm like oh okay well then I'll leave that to you guys you know I think they're

01:22:27.380 --> 01:22:34.500
making I I I'm very dubious about one but this also might not be an actual uh thing that they're

01:22:34.500 --> 01:22:38.900
doing this may be how they explain what they're doing to people they have no intention of bringing

01:22:38.900 --> 01:22:46.980
back for a second season but it it what I'm hearing through the grapevine is that their methodology is

01:22:46.980 --> 01:22:56.660
like they're gonna they're just waiting to see how many people subscribe and then of that of that

01:22:56.660 --> 01:23:02.660
group of people that subscribe like how many of them based on the behaviors that are very

01:23:02.660 --> 01:23:08.820
monitorable from youtube's cockpit like how many of them subscribed for your show and how many of the

01:23:08.820 --> 01:23:14.100
like very very meticulous intricate very valuable data but there's this kind of aspect to it where

01:23:14.100 --> 01:23:21.460
it's like they're not it it they're waiting to get the entire picture yeah yeah and I feel like

01:23:21.460 --> 01:23:26.500
scary about that all that stuff is so measurable now you know like like netflix they can tell

01:23:27.700 --> 01:23:31.860
what you watch how long you watch it did you watch the whole thing did you know did you not

01:23:31.860 --> 01:23:37.780
watch it you know what else you watch that's like that so that sort of stuff is scary and that like

01:23:38.660 --> 01:23:42.900
because you know none of those places have ratings but they have even more specific data you know

01:23:42.900 --> 01:23:48.660
which is but I would have liked because it's your show it makes more sense just the title

01:23:48.660 --> 01:23:56.340
makes more sense the premise makes more sense my show was uh it ended up being community but if

01:23:56.340 --> 01:24:02.740
what if esports you know it was and it was like kind of like oh this could be a real tv show

01:24:02.740 --> 01:24:07.620
and if I had known what the business plan was going to be in terms of like how you got a pickup

01:24:07.620 --> 01:24:13.220
yeah I would have called my show for instance do you want to see a dead body like literally because

01:24:13.220 --> 01:24:20.420
that's like the most brilliant because it's like it just I would have leaned into some kind of hook

01:24:20.420 --> 01:24:28.500
or I would have called it like fuck fuck yeah you know like oh fuck cool cool dicks but there

01:24:28.500 --> 01:24:35.780
was a lot of talk of like tv 14 yeah yeah yeah this is that it was like it was like well that

01:24:35.780 --> 01:24:41.780
sounds weird because you like like that's not amazon that's not netflix that's those other

01:24:41.780 --> 01:24:45.460
companies were just like yeah it is true that those companies are like well we don't really

01:24:45.460 --> 01:24:50.180
know what we're doing so let's just start doing it yeah who wants 10 episodes okay this person

01:24:50.180 --> 01:24:56.660
worked in tv this person worked on tv and that that I'm worried about this model like dying on

01:24:56.660 --> 01:25:01.300
the vine a little bit like but but that again they're youtube so they get all the money in the

01:25:01.300 --> 01:25:06.180
world they can do it once wrong and then shake it off and do it and then be even better than

01:25:06.180 --> 01:25:11.300
everybody well they're definitely figuring aspects of it out I think like because I was worried about

01:25:11.300 --> 01:25:17.380
that too um like the tv 14 type approach because I didn't want to do that I don't want to like make a

01:25:17.380 --> 01:25:22.660
show that's appropriate or palatable for like little kids like I don't really care like all

01:25:22.660 --> 01:25:29.700
I really wanted to do is make a super fucked up funny show with our friends you know and like I

01:25:29.700 --> 01:25:34.900
knew that if we did that then that's all I can control like I can't control any of the other

01:25:34.900 --> 01:25:41.140
bullshit of the marketing and you know who subscribes to it and how many people blah blah

01:25:41.140 --> 01:25:47.620
so um yeah I try to approach things as I'm sure you do it's just like someone gave us some money

01:25:47.620 --> 01:25:51.860
to make this let's make this thing as cool as we can and then maybe we'll get to make more who

01:25:51.860 --> 01:25:56.660
knows if we don't I should have approached it more like that but then again that's not how tv that's

01:25:56.660 --> 01:26:02.500
not how this project got developed like uh people came in that like we're excited about the e-sports

01:26:02.500 --> 01:26:09.220
thing and it had an exciting take on it yeah we took it wide youtube red ended up expressing

01:26:09.220 --> 01:26:18.020
the most interest in it so that whole process is kind of like incompatible with the idea of

01:26:18.020 --> 01:26:25.460
and then we'll see if anyone wants to subscribe based on zero uh promotion and what they click on

01:26:25.460 --> 01:26:30.980
and how long they click on it like again I would have called my show pussyfoot yeah like it would

01:26:30.980 --> 01:26:37.060
have been the adventures of of pussyfoot new and the the sub sub headline would have been like

01:26:37.060 --> 01:26:42.180
could a pussy be a shoe like like like something or like I would have called it mixed nibblitz

01:26:43.220 --> 01:26:49.060
colon the pussy shoe diaries anything that would like be trendable and like clickable and like

01:26:49.620 --> 01:26:54.500
and and would have had like a gorilla feel to it too yeah I wouldn't have tried to make cheers

01:26:54.500 --> 01:26:58.580
that doesn't make any sense if you don't know cheers exist and frankly if you aren't being told by

01:26:58.580 --> 01:27:03.780
people magazine that cheers is worth watching you're not gonna watch it yeah yeah uh so I don't know

01:27:03.780 --> 01:27:11.940
uh I think we did it wrong well it's it's tricky for sure and and and our show just came out on

01:27:11.940 --> 01:27:18.020
Friday so I don't know I mean I will say this too about the the name of the show has not been an

01:27:18.020 --> 01:27:24.420
easy name in the current country that we live in because like you know we were gonna put the show

01:27:24.420 --> 01:27:30.340
out last month and then the las vegas shooting happened and youtube was like no no no no no no

01:27:30.340 --> 01:27:34.340
no no yeah don't put it in they were like you know let's let's move in I was like yes absolutely

01:27:34.340 --> 01:27:39.140
and then at a certain point you guys just do a little bit of ADR and change the name to the show

01:27:39.140 --> 01:27:44.820
is would you like to avoid seeing a dead body at all costs and then it's like I hate yeah yeah

01:27:44.820 --> 01:27:48.420
but I mean the only thing you can click on to guarantee you don't see one yeah there's like

01:27:48.420 --> 01:27:52.900
one coming around the corner oh god yeah I mean like you know I've just told people like in press

01:27:52.900 --> 01:27:57.940
and stuff like you know this is not me killing people there's no violence in the show it's just

01:27:57.940 --> 01:28:02.580
a fucked up treasure hunt you know it's like me it's like stand by me you know it's like but

01:28:02.580 --> 01:28:07.860
just with like funny adults that's really so but it's still like the name of it scared them a lot

01:28:07.860 --> 01:28:12.020
I think it's you know just as far as shit that keeps happening you know like they're like oh yeah

01:28:12.020 --> 01:28:15.860
we can't put it out now there was just you know yeah well let's wait until let's wait until these

01:28:15.860 --> 01:28:22.580
mass shootings cool down yeah or until or until death death goes away until until until until

01:28:22.580 --> 01:28:30.180
absolute oh like 100% saturation to the point where no one could possibly be offended because

01:28:30.180 --> 01:28:36.260
it would be like if your show was called who wants to breathe oxygen yeah because there's just dead

01:28:36.260 --> 01:28:43.460
bodies everywhere but but you know what's funny about this in like a weird like a magnolia ish

01:28:43.460 --> 01:28:51.700
way is I'm just remembering it not to make us feel old but it's got to be almost 20 years ago

01:28:51.700 --> 01:29:03.300
now when the human giant was on MTV and I had a sketch show on VH1 and the Virginia Tech massacre

01:29:03.300 --> 01:29:10.420
happened yeah and um and it was like I think Columbine happened before that right Columbine

01:29:10.420 --> 01:29:16.340
was before Virginia Tech but Virginia Tech was then like uh it was it was taken very seriously

01:29:16.340 --> 01:29:21.940
um I didn't mean to say that in an eye-rolling way I'm just like saying with all of us it's like

01:29:21.940 --> 01:29:26.820
Jesus Christ somebody send those people a message um about how serious to take death

01:29:28.260 --> 01:29:36.340
the but the craziest I was watching MTV I was watching your guy's show and that sketch uh

01:29:36.900 --> 01:29:44.500
blood blood packed blood oath yeah yeah it's a sketch uh sketch on the human giant show

01:29:44.500 --> 01:29:51.060
the the guys are trying to decide where to where to eat lunch um during their business lunch and

01:29:51.060 --> 01:29:57.860
they take a blood oath to yeah we decide to go to a barbecue place but just in order to guarantee

01:29:57.860 --> 01:30:02.740
that no one will change their minds we go into like the storeroom of the store we work in like a

01:30:02.740 --> 01:30:08.020
fucking little tiny little video game store we're like okay well let's just just so we're on the

01:30:08.020 --> 01:30:12.020
same page like let's go take a blood oath you know so that no one changes where we're going today

01:30:12.020 --> 01:30:16.500
you know so we go in the back and there's just this fucking ritual where we all slice up in our

01:30:16.500 --> 01:30:22.580
hand and it becomes really gruesome and like when we drink blood it becomes like a bananas

01:30:22.580 --> 01:30:27.540
maybe I mentioned this the last time you were you were were you and sheer on the show together

01:30:27.540 --> 01:30:31.300
and on this show together maybe I last time yeah yeah and I did I did I bring this up I don't think

01:30:31.300 --> 01:30:40.020
so but yeah so I'm watching that sketch and and the other thing is that also at the time

01:30:40.020 --> 01:30:47.780
my my sketch show on vh1 like there was this cold open we wanted to do where there was a sniper

01:30:47.780 --> 01:30:53.380
in the in the show or something there was like kind of an old sc tv style thing where it was just

01:30:53.380 --> 01:30:56.900
like we would just have different gimmicks for our wrap around yeah like we wanted to just have

01:30:56.900 --> 01:31:03.300
there was a sniper loose as a cinematic trope now you can't pitch that without you you would think

01:31:03.300 --> 01:31:09.060
like oh you're doing a mass shooting jug it's like no snipers weren't that topical yeah yeah

01:31:09.060 --> 01:31:16.020
they were a cinematic trope yeah um and uh and and so it started we when we wrote it it was that

01:31:16.020 --> 01:31:22.500
and then Virginia Tech happened and then the word came down from vh1 um which is the same company

01:31:23.140 --> 01:31:28.660
Viacom yeah uh it's saying like no don't can't do this don't do that sniper sketch and then you

01:31:28.660 --> 01:31:34.900
turned on the tv and saw well I turn well here's what I saw and I still and I was like I thought

01:31:34.900 --> 01:31:41.540
I was watching it and then so that sketches they take the blood oath so then it just goes insane

01:31:41.540 --> 01:31:45.620
and it's like they're rubbing blood on each other's nipples and they're just like drinking blood

01:31:45.620 --> 01:31:50.260
and it's going insane and it turns into this like satanic thing and there's just blood everywhere

01:31:50.820 --> 01:31:59.540
and in the middle of it um just quietly and unceremoniously this giant lower third bug comes

01:31:59.540 --> 01:32:11.220
up and it says uh MTV uh uh supports the families of the victims of the Virginia Tech massacre

01:32:11.220 --> 01:32:17.700
are you serious uh it and it just stayed there during that sketch like just coincidentally

01:32:17.700 --> 01:32:23.060
or they I didn't think it was a coincidence because of the note I got from vh1 I was like oh they

01:32:23.060 --> 01:32:28.500
and I I parsed it in two I was like oh because we're not human giant we uh like we gotta get

01:32:28.500 --> 01:32:32.500
our thing killed but it was but then I thought well be reasonable Dan they already shot this

01:32:32.500 --> 01:32:40.500
it's airing and um they killed your script uh but this couldn't be killed so they brought

01:32:40.500 --> 01:32:46.340
this bug up over and that's amazing I but I don't but then I talked to people about it later and

01:32:46.340 --> 01:32:50.420
explain that story and so I don't know it could have been you even said like no that was that had

01:32:50.420 --> 01:32:57.700
to be coincidence just sheer coincidence but it looked like they I don't yeah that would be I don't

01:32:57.700 --> 01:33:05.060
think that they are organized enough to like go through their shows and know that there's a really

01:33:05.060 --> 01:33:11.860
violent bloody sketch airing tonight we should put a we should put a a condolence message there but

01:33:11.860 --> 01:33:17.780
that is perfect timing and also I don't know it sounds like something Viacom would do to

01:33:18.900 --> 01:33:22.660
this is this is really perfect way of dealing with it because then the families of the victims

01:33:22.660 --> 01:33:26.260
would be so relieved oh yeah they'd be watching the sketch they'd be watching the sketch well

01:33:26.260 --> 01:33:30.900
it wasn't there blood everywhere when my brother got killed and so I'm feeling bad I think I should

01:33:30.900 --> 01:33:36.580
start flipping the channel honey wait wait look there's a message we love you oh we love you

01:33:36.580 --> 01:33:44.500
Donald um fuck if they're gonna put that lower third I'm cool with it I'm cool with this sketch

01:33:44.500 --> 01:33:52.740
I think we killed Charles Manson did he just die he died at 816 is that true yeah did we kill him

01:33:52.740 --> 01:33:58.500
with our words I think right at the time that we were talking about him dying he died we said

01:33:58.500 --> 01:34:06.100
true we said Manson the third time and he his his juice wow yeah I don't want to become famous for

01:34:06.100 --> 01:34:11.860
that maybe we were the Manson killer but something something tells me it was gonna happen wow yeah

01:34:12.660 --> 01:34:18.500
so just uh is there any like what was it like just old age just uh I gotta I gotta go guys I'm

01:34:18.500 --> 01:34:23.380
so sorry I'm so upset about this it's just like he was a cool guy nobody wants to be drunk right

01:34:23.380 --> 01:34:27.700
now no no no he was just stay away I mean I gotta go I gotta go we should pour some more drinks we

01:34:27.700 --> 01:34:33.700
should pour some more drinks deal with this I am so sad he I heard he he he hung himself in his cell

01:34:33.700 --> 01:34:41.540
and his note said he's like look I know what's coming there's a lot of allegations yeah he didn't

01:34:41.540 --> 01:34:46.340
fucked up stuff people might be talking about this he's like yeah I don't you know this is gonna ruin

01:34:46.340 --> 01:34:56.900
me yeah Manson out I sexually assaulted Leslie van houten let's just say I did not run an equitable

01:34:56.900 --> 01:35:03.860
ranch there will be allegations I don't know why he didn't get killed in the first place while there

01:35:03.860 --> 01:35:08.740
wasn't a death penalty well because he I mean this is gonna sound I know how this is gonna make me sound

01:35:08.740 --> 01:35:13.780
and maybe never but I was just about to go like well because he barely did anything yeah yeah but

01:35:13.780 --> 01:35:18.740
that is the thing like I that's a 20 year old fetish I have not for Manson but just for like

01:35:18.740 --> 01:35:24.420
exceptionalism like like I I just get mad or I used to get mad I think there's some residual

01:35:24.420 --> 01:35:29.940
shit there where I would I just get mad about like how hypocritical we are about our treatment of

01:35:29.940 --> 01:35:36.180
prisoners murderers whatever like like he killed I think he killed a couple people here and there

01:35:36.180 --> 01:35:43.300
because he was a scumbag but he was in prison for his entire life because he had more influence

01:35:43.300 --> 01:35:49.700
over kids than the government yeah and I just always is like this is horse shit like like like

01:35:49.700 --> 01:35:54.740
I'm not that you should he should be out in the street but then again also like like like come on

01:35:54.740 --> 01:36:02.740
like it like pick a lane society are you do you respect this guy or do you like like like like

01:36:02.740 --> 01:36:06.100
I don't know man I remember seeing I've talked about on this podcast where I was like

01:36:06.100 --> 01:36:13.380
like where I saw like this this like inside the prison where he was and there was like this like

01:36:13.380 --> 01:36:18.660
security guard going like giving a tour of his cell and saying and like showing all the stuff

01:36:18.660 --> 01:36:23.700
that he was making like these art project like he'd made like a tarantula out of sock threads

01:36:23.700 --> 01:36:28.900
and it was like really looked like a tarantula sounds badass this is a good night to to to

01:36:28.900 --> 01:36:35.620
doff of the cap to Charles Manson's arts and crafts and and and he he like the prison guard

01:36:36.980 --> 01:36:42.020
kept picking up the stuff looks like he made a tarantula photo realistic tarantula out of

01:36:42.020 --> 01:36:45.860
sock threads you know again he's not supposed to be doing this because he doesn't have his arts and

01:36:45.860 --> 01:36:52.820
crafts card he lost it in February and I remember watching it going like where's your fucking card

01:36:52.820 --> 01:36:58.900
for anything you screw and I was like as my girlfriend who was like a huge Roman Polanski

01:36:58.900 --> 01:37:06.500
fan and who blames Roman Polanski's entire weekend shall we say she she just claims she blames I

01:37:06.500 --> 01:37:12.180
that was my first fight with that girlfriend and I found out like she's like why why don't you

01:37:12.180 --> 01:37:15.460
marry Charles Manson I was like what the fuck do you care what are you and she's like because

01:37:15.460 --> 01:37:19.860
you ruined Roman Polanski's life and it was like it was one of those like fights with a girlfriend

01:37:19.860 --> 01:37:23.540
where you actually kind of fall in love like like during the fight because you're like wow you're

01:37:24.180 --> 01:37:33.220
you're fucked up too like you you you really love Roman Polanski anyways so he died just being

01:37:33.220 --> 01:37:39.540
an old dude I'm pretty sure it's just being an old dude so wait refresh my memory so he so he

01:37:39.540 --> 01:37:45.140
so he he just told people to kill people I mean yeah he was definitely guilty of murders throughout

01:37:45.140 --> 01:37:51.620
his life but I think all of the murders that he actually committed himself he he was paid up on

01:37:51.620 --> 01:37:56.020
those because our society does let you murder some people and like serve a couple years in

01:37:56.020 --> 01:38:00.980
prison and he did do that and then but the real reason he was in prison is because he was like

01:38:00.980 --> 01:38:05.940
a cult leader that that inspired people to go out and kill a bunch of people yeah and I always found

01:38:05.940 --> 01:38:14.260
that a little I just now I'm 44 now he's dead I don't care I'm not an iconoclast anymore I want

01:38:14.260 --> 01:38:21.220
my old Obama society back I want I just want to be I just want a hot cup of coffee and some

01:38:21.220 --> 01:38:27.220
hypocrisy and some drone striking forced fucking like first world comfort I'm sorry I ever talked

01:38:27.220 --> 01:38:33.620
a tall game I was never Noam Chomsky I was never off the grid I never ate any kind of pill I'm a

01:38:33.620 --> 01:38:39.140
fucking pussy and I just want I just want my comfort back I'm sorry I ever sided with Charles

01:38:39.140 --> 01:38:46.500
Manson but I just at the time I felt like if you if you if you made me pick a side between

01:38:46.500 --> 01:38:51.860
the guy that's locked up for influencing people to murder people and the person who's saying

01:38:51.860 --> 01:38:54.980
yeah he's not supposed to make this spider because he doesn't have his hurts and crafts

01:38:56.180 --> 01:39:01.460
I just like I don't want to be on that team because then I'm next yeah I'm not going to tell

01:39:01.460 --> 01:39:06.180
anybody to kill anybody but at the time I was like you know maybe I'll be influencing people

it's not it's not your guys job to put me out of my misery but yeah no well done sir

01:47:29.380 --> 01:47:31.700
there were some catchy parts there were some catchy parts

01:47:33.460 --> 01:47:38.420
well you you have done stuff for HBO and you've done stuff for adult swim that you've been a

01:47:38.420 --> 01:47:42.660
producer is that something that you I know you're the best at bringing it back to me no this is the

01:47:42.660 --> 01:47:46.260
but I don't want to ruin it by saying it but this is the perfect fucking show format it's like

01:47:46.260 --> 01:47:55.060
just fucking that's my dream is just you like you like producing is it do you lean towards

01:47:55.060 --> 01:48:01.620
producing more than performing um I don't love doing that because it's hard yeah I don't like

01:48:02.340 --> 01:48:08.500
I tell you what I like I like it I'm as lazy as the next person I like it when you can show up

01:48:08.500 --> 01:48:16.020
and uh and they wrote a really funny script and you do that script and if and if there's time

01:48:16.020 --> 01:48:20.500
they're like in and improvise and also make it if you want to throw in your own jokes like I love

01:48:20.500 --> 01:48:27.860
that but um more and more it that doesn't happen very so I feel like I write stuff out of necessity

01:48:27.860 --> 01:48:32.980
like for for myself and that's not a sustainable life right like an actor's life I don't think that

01:48:32.980 --> 01:48:41.140
it really caught off guard like it's like next to NFL player in how how well you're treated

01:48:41.140 --> 01:48:47.220
for a very short time and then you can be and then you are you are your phone does not ring yeah

01:48:47.220 --> 01:48:52.900
I just didn't ever want to be one of uh you know you you know you want to be able to control

01:48:52.900 --> 01:48:59.620
things as much as you can and um and and I you know I I'm not a good writer I don't think I'm a

01:48:59.620 --> 01:49:06.980
good writer but I uh it's fucking really hard or I have a hard time writing you probably just

01:49:06.980 --> 01:49:12.820
fucking pound it out and it's genius but like I fucking sit there and like just sweat it out it's

01:49:12.820 --> 01:49:17.780
so hard but uh I just you know is that the hardest part what's that is that the hardest part or is

01:49:17.780 --> 01:49:23.540
the writing or is it harder to manage because the manager yeah yeah the managing of the thing

01:49:23.540 --> 01:49:28.980
I've had help with because uh like for dead body and stuff I did that with the guys from Children's

01:49:28.980 --> 01:49:33.620
Hospital with Abominable and so they help with all that and funnier die so I've had a lot of

01:49:33.620 --> 01:49:38.980
support with I don't know how to fucking hire crews and do a budget for a show like I I sort of

01:49:38.980 --> 01:49:45.700
hire someone to do that for me um but the actual like you know you but but so I try to focus on

01:49:45.700 --> 01:49:50.740
like the writing and then like getting the right mix of actors to help us out other comedy people

01:49:50.740 --> 01:49:56.900
to help us out so I like all that but but to your to your point I do that out of necessity

01:49:56.900 --> 01:50:04.100
because like to just be like a guy that's popping up every now and then on tv shows and movies like

01:50:04.100 --> 01:50:08.020
that you can't I don't know how you would can do that anymore like I think you have to have like

01:50:08.660 --> 01:50:12.900
you know I would just have to panic the whole time yeah you have to be creating stuff you know

01:50:12.900 --> 01:50:17.380
you have to uh because even if you're successful I think that those psychological of not controlling

01:50:17.380 --> 01:50:22.500
your own destiny is still a mind fucker which makes me admire actors because they I mean it's to be

01:50:22.500 --> 01:50:29.140
able to suppress that anxiety and not like succumb to that completely insane yeah but I I do get

01:50:29.140 --> 01:50:35.220
very jealous of people that um that just fucking show you know they just like oh and then I was on

01:50:35.780 --> 01:50:41.300
this show and then I would did this huge movie and now I'm I'm fucking set you know it's like

01:50:41.940 --> 01:50:47.380
I just haven't had that and like yeah you know um but more power to you if like that's yeah

01:50:47.380 --> 01:50:56.020
yeah if you can be a guy for hire yeah but what is the goal the goal because I I I've been a fool I

01:50:56.020 --> 01:51:00.340
think or have I maybe I'm nailing it I don't know because I just feel like I've spent so long in

01:51:00.340 --> 01:51:08.820
such a panic and I've backed into well it's like it's like there's this fundamental layer of like

01:51:08.820 --> 01:51:16.020
well you gotta not be homeless you gotta not end up fucked up like like like you gotta end up not

01:51:16.020 --> 01:51:22.100
stupid like like that you you didn't see this trend or that trend coming or the you know you didn't

01:51:22.100 --> 01:51:28.420
see your own obsolescence you didn't you gotta it's it's I just have this very Wisconsin like

01:51:28.420 --> 01:51:33.780
just terror in me that I don't even think about it's just there it's just the foundation of my life

01:51:33.780 --> 01:51:40.100
it's like you gotta retire which is so funny because it's like I'm not yeah I have no desire to

01:51:40.100 --> 01:51:47.940
like I do like I would fucking I like not knowing the answer to that question is called freedom

01:51:49.780 --> 01:51:58.020
all you have to do is find a million dollars under a rock and then I yeah I do Rick and Morty

01:51:58.020 --> 01:52:07.620
I do stuff for fun like I I oh no come back come back well I was just thinking I was just

01:52:07.620 --> 01:52:11.620
thinking about the fact that I'm yeah I'm just so wrong about everything because I always I do all

01:52:11.620 --> 01:52:20.100
this shit you know and it probably like it's like Rick and Morty comes from such joy so easy

01:52:20.100 --> 01:52:25.220
it's like adult swim said do something and I said well I don't want to do something bad so I called

01:52:25.220 --> 01:52:31.860
Justin and then like just just just yes and Justin into this thing that makes so many people happy

01:52:31.860 --> 01:52:37.140
that then also now is the thing that I'm gonna end up that is gonna represent the biggest paycheck

01:52:37.140 --> 01:52:42.420
I've ever gotten out of all the shit that I've ever done and it it's also the thing that was just

01:52:42.420 --> 01:52:46.820
fun so what is all this other daffy duck shit that I'm always pulling where I'm like well you

01:52:46.820 --> 01:52:52.500
know I think that fiber optic is the future so I want to get in a room with Taco Bell and

01:52:52.500 --> 01:52:58.660
talk to them about a sketch show made of ground beef yeah where you can vote for each crouton and

01:52:58.660 --> 01:53:06.100
I've got I call it the Harmon Taco Deluxe uh package and like like I'm trying to be a producer

01:53:06.100 --> 01:53:12.260
because I'm in a panic you know yeah I don't I don't know the answer I guess it just depends on

01:53:12.260 --> 01:53:19.220
what yeah what you how you value your time and how you value your sanity and and and how and if money

01:53:19.220 --> 01:53:25.620
is the most important thing or if it's just like oh I want to make something that I really like and

01:53:26.500 --> 01:53:30.660
you know I don't know I don't know it's different for everybody I guess except for the hustle the

01:53:30.660 --> 01:53:36.180
hustle is the same for all yeah yeah whether it comes from wanting to retire earlier whether it

01:53:36.180 --> 01:53:39.940
comes from having to put foot on the table or whether it comes from wherever it's it does not

01:53:39.940 --> 01:53:44.820
change well that's what's funny but you've been great at it well I don't know about great but I

01:53:44.820 --> 01:53:48.980
just try to fucking keep doing shit but uh but thank you for saying that but but that's what's

01:53:48.980 --> 01:53:54.020
funny to me is like people online or whatever like on Twitter or whatever just like what when people

01:53:54.020 --> 01:53:58.660
say like why the fuck would you do that what you know see you in something that shitty like oh why

01:53:58.660 --> 01:54:04.420
would you do it's like well one you just try a lot of shit some of it is good some of it is not good

01:54:04.420 --> 01:54:09.620
you saw something that wasn't that good I'm doing other shit too you know um but I agree with you

01:54:09.620 --> 01:54:14.340
that thing was not that good you know like you know whatever but uh why were you in Garfield seven

01:54:14.340 --> 01:54:18.820
yeah yeah yeah um and then and then yeah but then there's stuff like that like like I would be in

01:54:18.820 --> 01:54:23.140
Garfield seven in a heartbeat well because the stakes are pretty low like you shouldn't care if

01:54:23.140 --> 01:54:27.780
you're why are you watching Garfield seven exactly that's that's what I say why the fuck are you

01:54:27.780 --> 01:54:35.140
watching why why did you see me at that party yeah yeah I would love to be in Garfield seven

01:54:35.140 --> 01:54:41.460
I feel like that stigma has gone away which is a good thing probably but it's gone away because

01:54:41.460 --> 01:54:50.340
like that Hollywood like edifice has been cracked like we're we're on it like people look at what

01:54:50.340 --> 01:54:56.180
we do as honest labor now a little bit they look at it as very very privileged like we're lucky

01:54:56.180 --> 01:55:04.020
because I haven't lifted a box in years yeah um and I have a five bedroom house and I don't have

01:55:04.020 --> 01:55:10.980
five children I have two dogs and some slim gyms and and and it's like so it's a mansion

01:55:11.700 --> 01:55:18.420
relative to what I've done and who I am and it's a fucking wonderful life um and so it's

01:55:18.420 --> 01:55:23.540
but I do at the same time think that on an unconscious level people don't think about it

01:55:23.540 --> 01:55:28.580
anymore the way they used to I remember when David Cross was in small soldiers too or something

01:55:28.580 --> 01:55:35.300
and I was like what David yeah because I was fresh off the boat from Milwaukee and was like

01:55:35.300 --> 01:55:40.260
oh yeah it's just everything was a choice and everything mattered and like I don't think any

01:55:40.260 --> 01:55:46.020
I can't imagine anybody's like Aubrey Plaza why'd you do Grumpy Cat like like like I don't I think

01:55:46.020 --> 01:55:51.700
the answer to everything now is because it's a joke because life's a joke right because

01:55:51.700 --> 01:55:57.380
because working is important and it also sometimes it's like it was December and there was nothing

01:55:57.380 --> 01:56:02.820
else going on I wanted to go to fucking you know they were shooting it in Australia and I thought

01:56:02.820 --> 01:56:06.900
that'd be a fun place to go but that old world I was in the middle of depression and they called

01:56:06.900 --> 01:56:10.660
so I had to get off the couch yeah or I just broke up with my boyfriend and I wanted to get away

01:56:10.660 --> 01:56:18.900
from him so I went to yeah me wondering why David Cross is in small soldiers too uh comes from this

01:56:18.900 --> 01:56:24.980
weird old world supposition that the goal is to become Kerry Grant or something that there's gonna

01:56:24.980 --> 01:56:28.900
be like like Laura you're gonna be in Lawrence of Arabia if you play your cards right or you're

01:56:28.900 --> 01:56:33.460
gonna beat Bill Murray and like I just don't we don't we see that doesn't exist anymore I don't

01:56:33.460 --> 01:56:37.540
yeah it's hard to tell though because it's a moving target because like my world has become

01:56:37.540 --> 01:56:42.180
completely different so I don't know if when I like I don't know if the world has changed or I've

01:56:42.180 --> 01:56:48.260
changed but when I see a a poster on a bus stop and like Paul F. Tompkins is looking out from

01:56:48.260 --> 01:56:53.300
behind a genie bottle or whatever that's I'm making that up that's not real but but if if I saw that

01:56:53.300 --> 01:57:00.580
I would be like I toot my horn and go like fuck yes Paul F. get it get that paycheck yes um but

01:57:00.580 --> 01:57:08.660
I don't but maybe that's that's a total distortion of of working out here yeah I don't I don't know

01:57:08.660 --> 01:57:14.820
that those uh that that status exists anymore of like oh then you just like the Kerry Grant

01:57:14.820 --> 01:57:19.060
analogy is like a good one but yeah I don't I don't think that exists I don't think you ever

01:57:19.060 --> 01:57:24.340
graduate to this stratosphere where then you just fucking like coast you know and you're just in

01:57:24.340 --> 01:57:30.820
the fucking huge awesome projects I mean maybe like I feel like Chris Pratt has done that you know

01:57:30.820 --> 01:57:38.180
like in a in a cool way like he's in huge cool movies and uh you know uh you know even Middle

01:57:38.180 --> 01:57:44.180
Ditch is doing phone ads that and and usually you didn't do those at the same time you do a series

01:57:44.180 --> 01:57:48.100
get off the series and you'd be like do you guys miss me I'm repping I'm repping a product but

01:57:48.100 --> 01:57:53.860
when I see Middle Ditch on that phone ad my first thought is cha-ching yeah like yeah so happy

01:57:53.860 --> 01:57:57.380
smart I think all that has changed I think the the commercial thing has changed I think like

01:57:57.380 --> 01:58:01.860
now yeah there's no shame in that like I feel like that's just fucking and it's simultaneous their

01:58:01.860 --> 01:58:06.900
money yeah you're on a tv show yeah and you've got great commercials it's great yeah cuz and I

01:58:06.900 --> 01:58:13.060
would feel the same way about an NFL player like if you I I'm not a fan of sports but every time I

01:58:13.060 --> 01:58:20.420
see an athlete in a sock commercial or something I'm like oh good save your money like don't like

01:58:20.420 --> 01:58:24.900
you're a gladiator and they're gonna murder you and hang you up to dry I'm like it's so great for

01:58:24.900 --> 01:58:30.500
you and your family that you got to like advertise beef steak or something like like if you make it

01:58:30.500 --> 01:58:35.460
through that thing like just put that money in a coffee can and fucking guard it with a shotgun

01:58:35.460 --> 01:58:41.940
like buy a house in the worst part of the country and so that it stays there forever stay form

01:58:41.940 --> 01:58:49.940
it's the greatest assurance that'll play stay form my name is jumping jack the lightning

01:58:49.940 --> 01:58:56.260
you probably ask yourself why I'm at our hop is there is there any commercial not that you were

01:58:56.260 --> 01:59:02.260
doing him but is there any commercial that Shaq will not be back pain like bad pills

01:59:02.260 --> 01:59:15.380
taco bell pepsi don't backpill the pins underwear yeah yeah I was at the I was at the Turner

01:59:15.380 --> 01:59:25.140
up front and who was the it was the combination of like Conan and I think Charles Barkley and

01:59:25.140 --> 01:59:31.700
uh Anderson Cooper like really fun but I was I was a mate like Charles Barkley is like really

01:59:31.700 --> 01:59:37.140
funny as I was like really is he known as among that I don't know him he's hilarious but I mean

01:59:37.140 --> 01:59:43.300
