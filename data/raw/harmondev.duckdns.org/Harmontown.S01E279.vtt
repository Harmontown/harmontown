well we asked the question who has a date with oscar yeah i think yeah just so you know a little

02:53.920 --> 03:00.880
behind the scenes although we like to let the magic be magical but because so many people

03:00.880 --> 03:07.760
put so much work into it our oscar episode is always you know we start in february like early

03:07.760 --> 03:14.480
february rehearsing um as soon as the nominations are announced we start writing our sketches

03:14.480 --> 03:21.920
um so we we already know runner we already know who won well we we we we we wrote three

03:21.920 --> 03:28.560
sketches for yeah most of the categories but as the results come in we've got little

03:28.560 --> 03:33.040
comedy sketches that we're going to do what did you think about uh some high x uh

03:35.600 --> 03:40.000
wardrobe dress uh i thought it went a little too far

03:40.000 --> 03:47.680
far in which direction uh i thought i thought i thought i thought it was a little risque

03:47.680 --> 03:56.320
but you know what you go selma you go selma uh what did you think of selma high x uh attire

03:56.320 --> 04:03.040
i thought it was tasteful oh okay was it yes okay well bad guess on my part then

04:03.040 --> 04:09.120
you but who is it was maya rudoff at church who is the gal the chick that was with uh maya rudoff

04:10.160 --> 04:15.920
tiffany had it fucking hilarious they should host all the oscar's from now on they were

04:15.920 --> 04:21.920
fucking hilarious yeah they came out with their heels off and they held them like fuck this shit

04:21.920 --> 04:29.040
and and and they were maya rudoff was wearing like a sleigh like a giant red snuggie and she

04:29.040 --> 04:34.000
looked great i'm not i'm not talking shit she looked fantastic but she did not play ball

04:34.000 --> 04:40.320
like in the oscar fashion she did her own shit and they were way funnier than everybody else

04:40.320 --> 04:44.240
and like no offense to jimmy kimmel who's doing a good job as far as because we only

04:44.240 --> 04:51.680
watched probably what the third of it church the fourth uh he was doing a good job but maya rudoff

04:51.680 --> 04:59.440
and haddish that's what he said how do you say her name tiffany had it tiffany haddish

05:00.080 --> 05:06.240
fucking hilarious well i'll have to check it out i was a little disappointed i got to be honest with

05:06.240 --> 05:16.240
you that uh what's her name from church i'm blanking you have to give more more of a clue

05:16.240 --> 05:26.160
the the mom from uh leddie bird why can't i remember her name ever lori metcalf who's one

05:26.160 --> 05:30.960
of my favorites her name is always like a fucking blank for me lori metcalf that was so good and

05:30.960 --> 05:35.600
she did not win best supporting actress although i thought she might have so the results are still

05:35.600 --> 05:40.320
coming in i take it oh yeah the best picture hasn't been announced but but get out what do you think

05:40.320 --> 05:45.040
then predict it right now make your call because it hasn't that'll be the last thing it'll probably

05:45.040 --> 05:50.880
happen an hour from now like my gut says get out i mean i but i don't really know how the oscar

05:50.880 --> 05:59.200
voting works i mean i know that it's like you know it's it's a lot of actors of a lot of

05:59.200 --> 06:04.000
ages so it's all about yardage sometimes you sometimes you make the prediction based on well

06:04.000 --> 06:11.280
it's a liberal political like easy darling like like it's it's hollywood it's good but but then

06:11.280 --> 06:17.120
every bit you know look let's face it like something like get out you could find the line

06:17.120 --> 06:23.840
within liberal hollywood elite like they're the baby boomers that probably dominate the academy

06:25.120 --> 06:30.960
probably might have watched get out and been like i don't see i don't like that i would have

06:30.960 --> 06:43.520
thought that shape of water was going to win but church what were you saying that there is a beef about

06:43.520 --> 06:46.480
come on stage church like if you're going to talk grab a mic

06:50.000 --> 06:54.160
he asked you a question and then halfway through your answer yeah well if you're going to come on

06:54.160 --> 06:58.240
stage if you're going to talk well she she if you're not going to ignore me she had to turn

06:58.240 --> 07:03.600
off the live stream to be on the show right like that live stream is that's money out of our pocket

07:03.600 --> 07:10.400
anyway yeah what's up with that live stream church you you're you're you're telling people to not

07:10.400 --> 07:18.240
subscribe to our shit teasing all right stream subscription it's church with the oscar data

07:19.360 --> 07:23.760
what's up with what's up with shape of water what's what's the beef there was so what i was

07:23.760 --> 07:32.320
horror was there a couple days ago was that they're being sued for plagiarism there's a lawsuit

07:32.320 --> 07:40.560
that brought got brought up by the inheritors of the rights to a play like the kids of this guy

07:40.560 --> 07:50.720
this playwright about them lifting it seems like most of the story from this play so it's a it's a

07:50.720 --> 07:58.960
fish man there's a girl who works as a maid in the in like the the lab where they're keeping this

07:58.960 --> 08:06.000
fish man in the play there's even a scene where the cat's head gets lopped off in this play so

08:06.640 --> 08:11.360
there's and those are just the examples that were given in this article about it and their kind of

08:11.360 --> 08:17.600
accusation was well isn't this lawsuit timely right when the Oscars are happening and their response

08:17.600 --> 08:26.320
back was that's ludicrous you know we have a case and it's coming up because your film came out

08:26.320 --> 08:31.200
and oh the insinuation was that there was some kind of like weird they were trying to like time it

08:31.200 --> 08:36.800
to get the money or whatever by trying to hold the the film hostage like it might jeopardize

08:36.800 --> 08:44.240
whether or not it could win things like best screenplay for example doesn't have that oscar

08:44.240 --> 08:52.640
flavor to me shape of water anyway you know right what what does for you well get out i guess yeah

08:52.640 --> 08:58.400
but i i mean i know it's very simple and it's i want that to win but well i honestly florida

08:58.400 --> 09:04.320
project it didn't get it didn't get nominated for anything except defo and then like i what else was

09:04.320 --> 09:10.880
there it's just like it's post the post is it we know my feelings about that and uh three billboards

09:10.880 --> 09:17.760
uh like like uh my bounds so i i didn't see ladybird i didn't see i don't know what the nominees

09:17.760 --> 09:23.520
for best picture are but but but i didn't i love ladybird i love ladybird the only thing i saw that

09:23.520 --> 09:28.480
seems like a shoe in is is is get out but shoe in is like with giant air quotes because it's not

09:28.480 --> 09:34.240
we're not talking about a popularity contest we're also not talking about like a craftsmanship like

09:34.240 --> 09:40.560
it's a bummer that our friends uh emily and george uh and kumail did not win for a screenplay but

09:40.560 --> 09:48.000
it's awesome that jordan peel won for get out that's that's amazing yeah i mean obviously yeah it's

09:48.000 --> 09:54.240
more of a tragedy for us because kumail and emily are family so we'd rather they win but uh yeah if

09:54.240 --> 10:02.160
you're at least they didn't lose to something that we also hated and like kumail just tweeted

10:02.160 --> 10:10.240
they came in second place uh i mean i have to honestly it's like it is an honor to be nominated

10:10.240 --> 10:14.880
it is enough i mean i'm sure it's a bummer to not win yeah it's not just something that people say

10:14.880 --> 10:20.480
you get to wear that that title for the rest of your life your oscar nominated so and so forever

10:20.480 --> 10:26.800
or actually i just realized you won an emmy for writing about the oscars yeah and uh monster house

10:26.800 --> 10:32.800
was nominated for an oscar but and that wasn't an honor so maybe kumail and emily i really bummed

10:32.800 --> 10:37.840
out tonight hell yeah but i don't think it's a different thing because it's not i always forget

10:37.840 --> 10:42.720
monster house was nominated for oscar because really it's like you you make an animated film over a

10:42.720 --> 10:48.400
certain budget you and you know like it it didn't feel like it didn't feel like monster house was

10:48.400 --> 10:58.400
a citizen cane of also there was like a page one rewrite on that like wasn't there uh didn't they monster house but did monster house get rewritten by somebody like a

10:58.400 --> 11:04.480
handed off to another writer or no oh well yeah it wasn't like it but it wasn't nominated for best

11:04.480 --> 11:10.080
screenplay anyway it was but nominated for like best animated feature or something i think uh either emily or

11:10.080 --> 11:16.480
kumail tweeted like i would happily lose uh an oscar to jordan peel for the rest of my life

11:16.480 --> 11:24.480
like yeah and i think that he means that or she means that yeah it was a good it's a good year to get nominated in that category

11:24.480 --> 11:30.320
and and not win because you can you can save for the rest of your life the competition was incredibly

11:30.320 --> 11:37.840
stiff the the best original screenplay category i've always said is is curiously uh seems immune

11:37.840 --> 11:44.480
from any kind of like corruption or or value drift that you could accuse the oscars of ever having

11:44.480 --> 11:50.320
like i've always felt like the original screenplay uh nominees and winners are pretty

11:51.440 --> 11:57.760
like i've i've never i don't remember ever going what you know like it's it's it's it's it seems like

11:57.760 --> 12:03.680
people have a head on their shoulders about it or maybe it's just like an easy thing to to go ah that

12:03.680 --> 12:10.160
movie was very written i don't know i i like that Dunkirk won like the moment we stopped watching it

12:10.160 --> 12:19.440
they'd already won three oscars uh for sound design sound editing and editing um and like oh yeah like

12:19.440 --> 12:25.840
that's like like star wars and baby driver didn't win those things like normally like it's like a

12:25.840 --> 12:31.440
transformers that win sound design that makes a bunch of noise or some horrible shit like i like that

12:31.440 --> 12:37.440
they left it to like a movie that just told one very simple story i'm only gonna say it one more

12:37.440 --> 12:42.960
time now that the oscars are over if you're a director and there's more than three kids in

12:42.960 --> 12:48.560
your movie that are on screen for more than a half hour uh you should automatically be nominated

12:48.560 --> 12:54.880
as a director that's why i feel the florida project was snubbed i and then you count willem

12:54.880 --> 13:04.960
defoe in there who is a very talented actor but as we've seen from his oof um he doesn't come to set

13:04.960 --> 13:13.680
that ready to ground it you know like he like nicholas cage he's perfectly capable in the

13:13.680 --> 13:23.200
right hands of of of being a strat of areas but he will just show up as garage band um if if left

13:23.200 --> 13:29.520
unchecked and here's my fear because like well somebody like like on the on the crew here like

13:29.520 --> 13:37.040
keep us posted who wins best actor because i don't want it to be gary oldman for his impression

13:37.040 --> 13:43.200
of church hall i don't want that to happen what put a pin in that we'll get back to that i what

13:43.200 --> 13:50.960
what was the what was itanya up for did it did the director of itanya get nominated i don't know

13:50.960 --> 13:56.800
but that was the winner of best supporting actress was the mom and uh and she was great

13:56.800 --> 14:03.600
she was fantastic uh but but uh yeah i mean i those are the two directors to me florida project

14:03.600 --> 14:10.240
person and itanya person don't can't remember either their names i but i would if i was a

14:11.360 --> 14:22.160
a a betting person like betting on length and uh a contribution of careers to come like i would

14:22.160 --> 14:28.800
put a lot of money on those two i think those movies were outstanding demonstrations of

14:29.600 --> 14:34.640
specifically direction i think that i think that directors get ripped off a lot of the Oscars

14:34.640 --> 14:41.600
because it's hard to i i think that i i'm gonna probably get a bunch of tomatoes thrown at me

14:41.600 --> 14:48.240
by a lot of like i don't know this is a provocative thing to say but i think actors control the academy

14:48.240 --> 14:53.760
and actors don't you know to to them directors are like these assholes that tell you what to do

14:55.200 --> 15:00.160
but to be fair when the director fails no one will ever know that they'll just see shitty

15:00.160 --> 15:03.840
performer there's performances out of the actors too so they kind of take the fall

15:04.480 --> 15:09.520
when as much as getting all the kind of glory and attention and and having all the focus put

15:09.520 --> 15:15.680
on the acting yeah this is definitely like an actors event i just feel like not to be pedantic

15:15.680 --> 15:20.240
about it but if you ask a writer who's a good director the writer's gonna have an answer that

15:20.240 --> 15:26.800
has something to do with like you know how they affected that person's script and also that writer

15:26.800 --> 15:31.680
is gonna they're gonna be far from the trenches and able to observe it kind of rationally um

15:32.240 --> 15:36.960
the if you ask other directors directors are gonna go of course i well my god i couldn't

15:36.960 --> 15:41.760
have gotten that performance out of that cat or you know that that that was beautiful that that

15:41.760 --> 15:46.880
that shot and this was i i know what goes into directing at blah blah blah but if you ask an actor

15:46.880 --> 15:54.480
i feel like they're so close to it uh that that that i feel like i hate to offend my actor friends

15:54.480 --> 16:01.280
but i i feel like an actor in general as like a biomass like an actor would go oh who's who's the

16:01.280 --> 16:07.360
best director uh oh yeah that one person that uh uh they did very few takes and they let me go home

16:07.360 --> 16:14.400
on time yeah but i think i love that guy my understanding of how like at least the nominations

16:14.400 --> 16:21.040
process works is that it's like the previous winners from your category so it's like the

16:21.040 --> 16:24.880
other directors who've won best director or it's like the other oh is it doesn't really work out

16:24.880 --> 16:30.080
so they yeah so their job is to like watch all the the things that are nominated they want to

16:30.080 --> 16:35.520
consider for that category and then they decide who's not me so like my friend it was my friend

16:35.520 --> 16:38.640
michael dana who explained this to me because he was like oh i gotta watch all these movies and

16:38.640 --> 16:47.200
decide who to nominate for a best um score best original score because now that he had won for

16:47.200 --> 16:53.760
life of pie he was now on that panel to make those decisions so your job is to listen to everything

16:53.760 --> 16:57.680
and decide okay these are worthy of nomination these are not so then you narrow it down and then

16:57.680 --> 17:02.080
everybody votes oh but then but then is my understanding everybody votes it's it's a it's

17:02.080 --> 17:06.320
so yeah because then everybody throws their hat and it goes okay so from so from the nominations

17:06.320 --> 17:12.000
from the people who are the peers in those groups now everybody gets to weigh in i kind of wish

17:12.000 --> 17:20.560
i wish they carry through the jury of peers in your craft all the way to the finish line because

17:20.560 --> 17:25.360
that way you wouldn't have this the potential value drift i mean it would be only to the extent that

17:25.360 --> 17:32.560
the definition of good directing ever changed you know then that would change like i it really it

17:32.560 --> 17:37.200
really seems like that would be and then imagine the honor that that would be too you'd be like holy

17:37.200 --> 17:42.560
shit like scorsese but maybe that's why it's such an honor to be nominated though well yeah exactly

17:42.560 --> 17:46.480
because the nomination is the thing that you're actually getting from other people who you've

17:46.480 --> 17:51.920
looked up to for so many years and aspired to be like not the win and if you get an asker it could

17:51.920 --> 17:57.760
just be marisa tomei got drunk and she's like just kidding i love her uh it's just like so scared

17:57.760 --> 18:02.880
marisa tomei's watching i say we go around the room right now and see who can do the best bad

18:02.880 --> 18:10.400
Churchill because he just wants to do his Churchill let's start with jeff all right i'll start go ahead

18:10.400 --> 18:16.160
jeff no we are dan you want to start no we're starting with jeff all right we shall never

18:16.160 --> 18:23.360
you end up that's me doing gary oldman's Churchill okay then you're i mean i don't

18:25.680 --> 18:30.080
there's i'm coming out in a state of nature

18:32.880 --> 18:42.400
that's good transfer um you're a bitch all right he was like a womanizer right or like a woman

18:42.400 --> 18:49.200
beater yeah something like that yeah i that wasn't the movie yeah i'm gonna have to look

18:49.200 --> 18:53.840
because you want to look that up your name is partially partially Churchill so why don't you

18:53.840 --> 18:59.040
bring it home yeah you should be the best of this these are fight them on the beaches

19:00.240 --> 19:09.040
hell yeah blow on we will not say that the greeks fight like heroes but not the heroes fight like

19:09.040 --> 19:16.400
greeks that's a direct quote jeff what is so was mine what is your beef i understand the movie

19:16.400 --> 19:22.000
wasn't we shall never you end up do you really think that was a that gary oldman's doing a bad

19:22.000 --> 19:28.480
job in that role i just i think you i'm not i look i'm not a big gary oldman fan i think he's

19:28.480 --> 19:33.760
one of our bias he's a great overactor i just thought that movie here's the deal the movie

19:33.760 --> 19:38.720
sucked didn't go anywhere it was a movie about making one speech and they they ramp it up and he

19:38.720 --> 19:43.600
makes one speech and then the movie's over kind of interest i agree with you not a not a not an

19:43.600 --> 19:48.880
exciting movie uh and i'm not saying this is a mitigating factor but it is interesting

19:49.680 --> 19:54.720
when i watch them like wow so this is the guy that's famous for all those quotes like if you

19:54.720 --> 20:01.520
swing a cat at a quote yeah like it's a Churchill quote and uh and the movie's just about how that's

20:01.520 --> 20:07.520
all he ever did he just ran his mouth uh but but he he i mean he changed history running his mouth

20:07.520 --> 20:12.000
but it doesn't make for a particularly interesting biopic the end of the movie i was surprised at

20:12.000 --> 20:16.560
the end of the movie when i go what what just happened the guy goes he mobilized the English

20:16.560 --> 20:25.680
language and took it into battle which is a great line but that's act one like page one like it's

20:25.680 --> 20:31.680
like but now he was a loudmouth because he was half american and his mother was an american and

20:31.680 --> 20:37.280
they kind of got this sort of that kind of like bold outspoken like that's probably a movie so many

20:37.280 --> 20:44.720
people or did not like Churchill he ended up being a huge hero especially to americans i need to be

20:44.720 --> 20:52.480
corny erin sorkinny guy but i think if if i if i were had a gun turned on me like you gotta write

20:52.480 --> 20:58.000
the Churchill biopic i having found out through research what that movie reveals which is that

20:58.000 --> 21:04.480
there's not a huge arc for this guy etc and he didn't do a lot but but was very important just

21:06.160 --> 21:12.480
i would i would then go my my sorkin gland would then go okay well let's talk about his wife and

21:12.480 --> 21:17.360
let's you know that relationship because i thought that you know those scenes were touching and you

21:17.360 --> 21:22.880
could tell those were based on either internal notes or studio notes through like this thing needs

21:22.880 --> 21:28.160
something and so they had those one or two scenes with the wife where you're getting to know Churchill

21:28.160 --> 21:36.160
the the aging lover Churchill the uh the the the the baby that needs his diaper changed but acknowledges

21:36.160 --> 21:44.560
his his his wife is his mommy and uh uh Churchill's wife the dutiful you know uh the the woman has no

21:44.560 --> 21:53.360
name kind of like a selfless politicians wife kind of thing i if i would dig like sorkin deep

21:53.360 --> 21:58.640
for anything there and just figure out a three-act structure like have them have a fight on page 70

21:58.640 --> 22:08.480
and then have them kiss her on page 95 because that world war two story turns out it's pretty

22:08.480 --> 22:15.200
linear those nazis just kept coming and then uh you know who was a great Churchill was lithgow

22:16.160 --> 22:21.280
his his Churchill i thought was really do you why don't you do john john lithgow

22:21.280 --> 22:28.560
do your john lithgow as Winston Churchill is the only thing we have to fear is that

22:28.560 --> 22:36.560
it's not a circle it's the only one he didn't say well the the the fear one of the stick one

22:36.560 --> 22:42.400
those are roosevelt i think that was fdr fdr is fear fdr is fear roosevelt's stick everything

22:42.400 --> 22:53.520
else is Churchill yeah it is it's in it is in these times of circular mouths that one man's

22:53.520 --> 23:04.960
harry must come to his Henderson's where did Churchill say that i believe in this realm

23:07.600 --> 23:13.760
i believe in this island i thought you were giving me music i was trying to i was trying to give you

23:13.760 --> 23:21.280
the uh Jurassic Park theme jeff's ipad isn't working tonight when i look out at those lighthouses

23:21.280 --> 23:31.360
and spotted dicks that make up the coastline of this historically impenetrable isle

23:33.040 --> 23:38.000
i ask myself what will the man be who gives it up

23:38.000 --> 23:50.480
and the answer is a pariah he will be forever unforgiven and so i say you the house of lords

23:51.280 --> 23:59.760
and the commoners and the third parliament of groundlings we must come together in the opposition

23:59.760 --> 24:07.200
for the great creme de la creme the pièce de résistance

24:09.680 --> 24:18.240
the cockney wainscotting this country has never surrendered we were at stonehenge

24:18.240 --> 24:28.480
we were at baskerville we kept the hounds at bay jack the ripper recoiled from our touch

24:30.480 --> 24:38.400
pudding was invented here where the place ben franklin loved to come on the weekends

24:38.400 --> 24:50.240
that may have been france but we're 90 miles from there i'm john lift now say to you

24:52.240 --> 24:58.960
three five four what's in the blood of an englishman

24:58.960 --> 25:08.320
bravery victory bitch sticks and no fear

25:11.760 --> 25:12.560
dinosaurs

25:16.160 --> 25:20.560
what did he do he weaponized the english language

25:20.560 --> 25:30.640
so your version of winston churchill thought he was john lithgow

25:32.160 --> 25:40.320
he became he found out who he was yeah he's true to himself that's what gary oldman brought to the

25:40.320 --> 25:50.640
performance i think uh what was i gonna say what is it nazis nazis work oh the the it's it's funny

25:50.640 --> 25:54.640
how the you know the most devastating scene in that movie is the phone call when he calls

25:55.360 --> 26:02.880
calls roosevelt and he's like i have some airplanes and tanks and and it's just like that

26:03.440 --> 26:09.520
it's like any phone call from any decade within any relationship it's just like it's just

26:09.520 --> 26:16.080
heartbreaking like like someone just blowing someone off but it's like winston i i would give you

26:16.080 --> 26:25.280
anything but i i have to go take a poop now i i'll be back yeah i must have been how come the

26:25.280 --> 26:30.160
british don't hate us a little bit more because they lost their empire like we're about to

26:30.960 --> 26:36.480
like they lost their swag yeah but i mean doesn't that isn't that when you get angrier

26:36.480 --> 26:42.320
but they didn't have the army or the armada to to back that up but they can be as angry as they

26:42.320 --> 26:46.960
like no but i'm saying how come how come the story how come how come everybody just goes along

26:46.960 --> 26:53.520
with the story of us being uh swell and dandy in our handling of world war two because we did end

26:53.520 --> 27:00.880
up saving anybody's asses like when we finally did step in it it saved the day it's i mean isn't

27:00.880 --> 27:07.600
that something that an asshole does in a in a situation where they could observe that uh it's

27:07.600 --> 27:12.160
like well if i just wait a little longer you know i'll be a real hero here that's what we did we

27:12.160 --> 27:17.920
waited too long twice we could have saved them early in both world wars we were like gandalf with

27:17.920 --> 27:23.600
the eagles oh shit it's like well what the fuck yeah oh yeah yeah you had these eagles the whole

27:23.600 --> 27:29.840
god damn time because roosevelt was trying to dig the country out of a depression and the country

27:29.840 --> 27:35.040
didn't want another foreign war after world war one and it was a really unpopular idea so he was

27:35.040 --> 27:40.560
holding off holding off holding off holding off doing this and i guess they do and i guess we

27:40.560 --> 27:46.160
wish i had a historian or somebody appears i don't risk offending anybody but i that i i i recall

27:47.040 --> 27:55.440
that it's something that we like like we didn't the uh revelation of how much holocausting was

27:55.440 --> 27:59.760
happening was kind of like at the end like they figured that out when we got there there were

27:59.760 --> 28:05.520
rumors right because people had fled and so when you leave out that like kind of like very epic

28:05.520 --> 28:10.640
like uh genocide thing which is how we're all taught about world war two but when you just

28:10.640 --> 28:16.640
look at it minus that well it's just a giant war over in europe and they've already done one of those

28:16.640 --> 28:20.880
and so okay we're here on the other side of the atlantic which was a way bigger deal before the

28:20.880 --> 28:26.240
internet and uh so yeah okay i guess they just thought like they'll they'll work it out maybe

28:26.240 --> 28:34.080
hitler will be a great european chancellor and we'll we'll sell him steel and people loved him at first

28:34.880 --> 28:41.040
yeah he he did it he did it good they were doing a great job of repairing germany in the first few

28:41.040 --> 28:48.720
years it's when they started conquering everything and everyone around them that europe went uh maybe

28:48.720 --> 28:56.160
we need to call for backup oh hitler oh hitler we hardly knew ye

29:01.920 --> 29:07.760
i think our problem is we never really got to know hitler right we were we didn't give him a chance

29:09.200 --> 29:14.880
well i was surprised if i watched a conspiracy uh thing on netflix and i was i was kind of uh

29:14.880 --> 29:24.320
surprised at how um how likely it is that uh uh hitler faked his death

29:25.680 --> 29:30.160
like is that hunting hitler was you really watching hunting hitler it was just there was never i mean

29:30.160 --> 29:36.320
if you even if you go with the straight narrative with no conspiracy theories at all like the actual

29:36.320 --> 29:41.280
mainstream like this is what's supposed to have happened he shot himself from the head and

29:41.280 --> 29:48.880
and eve brown took cyanide and then the germans doused his body with gasoline and set it on fire

29:48.880 --> 29:53.440
in a shallow pit yeah and then covered that up with dirt and didn't tell anybody where it was

29:53.440 --> 29:57.680
because miscellany had just been strung up in the streets and he'd heard about it and didn't want

29:57.680 --> 30:02.800
his body to be mutilated his body guard took him out and said like like not only should he be dead

30:02.800 --> 30:07.840
and not be able to like be tortured he should be like mutilated and and like like like just burned

30:07.840 --> 30:14.480
to a cinder they shouldn't have the body to be able to um hang up on you know they took him out

30:14.480 --> 30:20.240
in the parking lot burned him up and buried him in a shallow pit now spoil sport to the very end

30:20.240 --> 30:28.320
now now let me let me let me run this by you my little my little historians uh in a world where

30:28.320 --> 30:36.000
we're in hitler's shoes there in the bunker like okay so he's he's that worried about his corpse

30:36.000 --> 30:44.560
being defiled that he's gonna say to somebody hey Todd come here i'm gonna uh uh after i do

30:45.440 --> 30:52.640
you'll hear a pop uh my wife will have white foam coming out of her mouth um don't try to

30:52.640 --> 30:59.840
resuscitate her you might die um he shot her and then himself do me do me a favor uh yeah

30:59.840 --> 31:08.560
this is like don't don't derail do me a favor i got i i'm planning ahead here i'm at i'm at

31:08.560 --> 31:15.200
i'm at the point where i'm gonna blow my brains out but i'm thinking this much ahead like about

31:15.200 --> 31:23.040
what's gonna happen to my body so i submit to you if he's thinking that much ahead you know it's only

31:23.040 --> 31:29.520
a little bit further ahead to go hey Todd who's that guy what was his name at the Christmas party

31:29.520 --> 31:34.080
everybody's joking he put the electrical tape on his lip and everybody's like he looks just like me

31:34.080 --> 31:44.320
yeah oh gary yeah and accounting yeah do me a favor uh put a mustache on him and bring him down here

31:44.320 --> 31:55.920
and uh and synthia from uh from uh hr um and uh you know bring him down and uh dress him like us

31:55.920 --> 32:02.240
and uh this is the conspiracy theory is that they did a little switcheroo and uh and hitler went

32:02.240 --> 32:06.240
out the back door which he very well but it's not like he was trapped in his bunker it was totally

32:06.240 --> 32:12.880
possible i mean it it it it it it seems like a thing that a spoil sport would do before he was

32:12.880 --> 32:19.840
like i won't let you string my corpse up well especially for the nazis who built secret tunnels

32:19.840 --> 32:24.800
everywhere and always had all kinds of exit plans and made like alliances in spain so that

32:24.800 --> 32:31.040
they could go through different countries and and and there were loads of nazis who did escape to

32:31.040 --> 32:37.280
like argentina manila and uh like like all these guys eichmann like they they they all made it out

32:37.280 --> 32:43.680
like yeah if i'm at war with your country and during the handful of years we were at war

32:43.680 --> 32:52.320
i'm finding out that you were uh uh diverting revenue to such causes as trying to sew a german

32:52.320 --> 32:58.080
shepherd's head onto a human body or finding out if uh the devil's real and maybe we could

32:58.080 --> 33:06.560
summon him here's here's what i'm not willing to do take anyone's word for it that like uh

33:06.560 --> 33:10.240
oh yeah our boss is over there in the pit he looks like a skeleton with a mustache on it but

33:10.800 --> 33:16.640
it's totally him i'd be like okay nazi if you see a skeleton with a mustache that was apparently

33:16.640 --> 33:23.920
burned like what was his mustache made and here's the thing like i guess uh the leaders of the time

33:25.600 --> 33:31.520
you know they were all all of the world leaders were like yeah i'll believe it when i see it like

33:31.520 --> 33:35.520
it was kind of like an open thing that people are like oh yeah hitler's dead yeah right

33:38.160 --> 33:42.720
yeah but he was hitler signings even all over the united states like once people realized what

33:42.720 --> 33:48.480
happened and that they didn't really have a body you start hearing all over the world people

33:48.480 --> 33:53.040
also lots of people look like hitler they saw a hitler over by the pool they saw him everywhere

33:53.040 --> 33:59.360
but they did they did find like a dental that jawbone that they set the russians the russians

33:59.360 --> 34:04.560
are the ones that finally verified it but they took so long it's almost like that's another it

34:04.560 --> 34:09.440
just becomes more suspicious i'm not new usually a conspiracy theory guy because i think conspiracy

34:09.440 --> 34:15.920
theories are cheating because you you just raise questions and and now more than ever we all i i feel

34:15.920 --> 34:24.640
like there's no such thing as conspiracy theory it's a conspiracy uh uh speaking of conspiracy

34:24.640 --> 34:31.760
theories uh alex jones is uh has he has he been deleted from youtube i hear that's a conspiracy

34:31.760 --> 34:38.400
they're using it as a way to earn money be like youtube's taking us down and only you can give us

34:38.400 --> 34:45.760
money to stop it and then youtube's like we don't care we fucking love nazis so did he did anything

34:46.720 --> 34:51.200
did they take did they delete him from youtube or not as far as i understand

34:54.000 --> 35:02.000
the what this is what's his name paul joseph watson that that uh he's a real piece of shit um but

35:02.560 --> 35:06.800
he apparently admitted he was like no it's a fucking we're just using it to get a lot of money

35:06.800 --> 35:14.160
it's our our youtube's fine but it's that's i think illegal to do to say to certainly the

35:14.160 --> 35:21.440
nadir yeah wow the nadir of our civilization has to be at this point just because now we've we've

35:21.440 --> 35:29.360
just hit the bottom with these um the way we're treating these high school kids uh that are bothering

35:29.360 --> 35:37.360
after i mean 20 years they they weren't alive when columbine happened and then this happens in their

35:37.360 --> 35:44.320
school i don't give a fuck what these kids think is the appropriate response i'm certainly behind

35:44.320 --> 35:50.240
them like no one's done anything for them it's like it's we're treating them like chickens in a

35:50.240 --> 35:59.600
fucking factory farm like we're like we're like putting them on a treadmill headed towards statistical

35:59.600 --> 36:10.960
likelihood of mass death and uh and and the gall of anybody to say to a 16 to 17 year old kid who's

36:10.960 --> 36:19.200
who's gonna go you know what uh hail mary uh uh maybe if instead of going home and shivering under

36:19.200 --> 36:30.320
my bed and weeping um i uh say some shit and politicize this uh maybe maybe something will

36:30.320 --> 36:36.480
change i like how do you how do you how do you fuck with that kid like like what like even if you

36:36.480 --> 36:44.720
are evil like just like what the fuck like it's it's great we've we've hit so far below rock bottom

36:44.720 --> 36:51.520
at that point where people are just like questioning these kids and making fun of them and like

36:51.520 --> 36:57.200
scrutinizing them and not just the conspiracy theorists but really the the more vile of the

36:57.200 --> 37:02.880
characters are the are the people that are like politically combating them and like going toe

37:02.880 --> 37:10.400
to toe with them with witty repartee that's like this is a child like like what the fuck

37:10.400 --> 37:20.080
have we are we doing and and to beat the horse bloody i i i we we we ceremoniously ritualistically

37:20.080 --> 37:27.120
stripped katie rich snl writer who was off duty and made the joke baron trump's gonna be the first

37:27.120 --> 37:33.520
homeschool shooter it's not even a joke that has to do with you know it's it's it's a it's a joke

37:33.520 --> 37:41.760
it was a joke about how that poor kid has the worst family ever and and is never gonna have a normal

37:41.760 --> 37:50.000
life and and in this orgy of we won and we're taking over the world like katie rich was taken

37:50.000 --> 37:56.080
to a stake and she was tied to it and she was set on fire and she was burnt slowly and as far as i

37:56.080 --> 38:01.520
know she's still laying low and enduring death threats and and whatever i don't know if she's

38:01.520 --> 38:06.720
recovered or whatever i know she never got her job back at snl i know that they never had to even

38:06.720 --> 38:11.680
do to the honor of telling her she was officially fired they just suspended her and then told her

38:11.680 --> 38:19.360
she wasn't coming back like like we all took part in that because kids are off limits because when

38:19.360 --> 38:26.960
it comes to joking around we got one rule but when it comes to blowing people's bodies across the

38:26.960 --> 38:33.680
floor we got no rules it's fucking it doesn't even mean anything to say the words it's insane

38:33.680 --> 38:38.400
anymore we've been saying it's insane the word insane means nothing did you hear that there's

38:38.400 --> 38:42.960
that kid seventh grade who is going to shoot up his school but he went into the bathroom and killed

38:42.960 --> 38:49.280
himself into the instead yeah it's getting to the point where we have to ask the mass shooters to

38:49.920 --> 38:55.920
like solve their own end of the problem i'm so i'm sorry i'm laughing literally no one else can

38:55.920 --> 39:01.840
do anything so if you're gonna shoot up a school why don't you kill yourself like that's that's

39:01.840 --> 39:07.440
where we're at in society is like the people who are willing to commit mass murders are like

39:07.440 --> 39:12.880
no this is this is actually crazy that i'm allowed to do this right so society is let this happen

39:12.880 --> 39:18.480
and we sit up here and we tell these kids like you know if you're having thoughts that you've

39:18.480 --> 39:24.080
never had before your your body is surging with hormones you you have god knows what going on

39:24.080 --> 39:30.320
like like please just talk about it like don't hurt yourself don't hurt other people just talk

39:30.320 --> 39:35.440
to someone about it talk to someone you can trust here's your hotlines like you know we we try to

39:35.440 --> 39:42.560
handle these kids with care when kids do something wrong we try them in a different court we we the

39:42.560 --> 39:47.520
idea is that before a certain age your your your neurology is forming and we we're supposed to be

39:47.520 --> 39:55.200
protecting you it's it's it's insane that this is up for debate now it's it's it's insane that

39:55.200 --> 40:05.040
that grown ass adults are are having like fucking weird flame wars with recent survivors of mass

40:05.040 --> 40:13.280
occurs who are not old enough to vote yet um and who are just saying maybe if i say so i just can't

40:13.280 --> 40:20.480
i mean i know that we all feel this way but what like how much further do we need to go

40:20.480 --> 40:29.840
before the moral majority an unfortunate borrowing of a different groups uh title but the the silent

40:29.840 --> 40:37.920
fucking normals the the the the relatively sane of us how how much further are we gonna get before

40:37.920 --> 40:45.360
we go the rules are done now they don't have rules maybe it's like the third of the population

40:45.360 --> 40:50.400
that's just never votes because they don't believe in the system and they're just watching the whole

40:50.400 --> 41:04.880
thing burn down and it's like i yeah i i i stand where you stand uh a non-voter a disenfranchised

41:04.880 --> 41:10.800
person person who doesn't think that anything but like okay but you gotta agree with me now

41:11.840 --> 41:18.160
right there is a difference between watching a system that is fucked up and rolling your

41:18.160 --> 41:25.120
eyes at it and watching children be abused like there's got to be a difference there's

41:25.120 --> 41:30.880
got to be a point where and and and i guess what it's like not only not only do we have to stop

41:30.880 --> 41:37.120
playing by the fucking rules that we made up and they've never followed but we've got to stop

41:37.120 --> 41:42.960
bitching at each other we've got to stop minding our fucking language with each other um we gotta

41:42.960 --> 41:48.800
put that shit on hold there not to mention the fact that there was a study just released that like

41:48.800 --> 41:56.480
not shocking to me at all that uh the the average african-american family in 50 years has made

41:56.480 --> 42:02.560
absolutely no progress in terms of of anything that actually matters the median income is

42:02.560 --> 42:11.200
projected to be zero dollars it it's like like like that's fucking predictable and it's it's

42:11.200 --> 42:16.480
fucking that should be a huge wake-up call for us we started trying to fix these problems by

42:16.480 --> 42:21.520
minding our language in the 90s and we had that wave and then it subsided and all these things

42:21.520 --> 42:27.520
people are laughing all the way to the bank when we ignore the the fundamentals of behavior and

42:27.520 --> 42:34.080
class systems and things and and and we got we we are we have fallen for the oldest trick in the

42:34.080 --> 42:40.880
book when we are standing at a at a at a at a protest with each other and someone uses the

42:40.880 --> 42:46.160
wrong pronoun and we get in a fight with them instead of fucking facing off with the fucking

42:46.160 --> 42:52.240
people with baby skulls on their helmets who are laughing at us because they have lost their souls

42:52.240 --> 42:58.960
to apathy they have lost their souls to to choices they made so long ago that if they

42:58.960 --> 43:05.200
un-make them now they'd be twice as humiliated as if they just went to hell and died not in that

43:05.200 --> 43:11.280
order they they they they they they it's like we've got to i god bless you and your fucking

43:11.280 --> 43:18.240
microaggressions watchdogging i i i i it's not that anyone wants your humanity to be divested

43:18.240 --> 43:28.800
but can't you see that we are divided and the bad guys aren't like can't you can't you prioritize

43:28.800 --> 43:39.040
can't you say first of all nazis are bad second of all killing children is bad third of all this

43:39.040 --> 43:45.760
fourth of all this fifth of all this six of all this and by the way don't call me that it bums

43:45.760 --> 43:53.600
me out now that we're fucking friends because we have to be or we're gonna die or put it this way

43:53.600 --> 43:59.200
if you're cynical because i don't want you to have to make a choice let's put it this way since

43:59.200 --> 44:10.640
we're going to die let's die friends let's die cool let's die arm in arm some of your fellow

44:10.640 --> 44:19.680
liberals are stupid a good 85 of them some of your friends that you're gonna rely on as this ship

44:19.680 --> 44:24.720
goes down are are gonna are gonna put their foot in their mouth they didn't grow up the same way

44:24.720 --> 44:29.760
you did they don't know all their peas and cues they're gonna put their elbows on the table like

44:29.760 --> 44:37.120
you have got to draw a thick heavy line somewhere in your own brain that separates that doofus

44:37.920 --> 44:46.080
who's a fixer-upper for a later date or a side project along the way like from the fucking thugs

44:46.080 --> 44:54.560
the barbarians the murderers they have targeted us they are trying to kill us they want us

44:54.560 --> 45:01.120
dead they have looked at the numbers and they have decided that democracy doesn't work for them

45:01.920 --> 45:09.200
because democracy doesn't work for the people that have more money than everyone they want us

45:09.200 --> 45:18.880
to die because if we keep being more than them and alive they lose the popularity contest

45:18.880 --> 45:30.080
they want lead in your water they want guns in your schools they want you arguing about whether

45:30.080 --> 45:36.240
or not your jacket is racist with the person in the same income bracket as you whose kids are in

45:36.240 --> 45:43.120
the same school as yours who are just as much at risk of the next mass shooting and and and I just

45:43.120 --> 45:51.040
don't I like like like why can't we why can't we hierarchically just go well I'm in the American

45:51.040 --> 46:00.480
League but then I'm on the Brewers you know like like like and I don't like the fucking this other

46:00.480 --> 46:05.680
baseball team because I gotta play them for the pennant or whatever the fuck I don't like isn't

46:05.680 --> 46:09.680
there isn't there a fucking natural thing that the human brain can do or you're like well

46:09.680 --> 46:17.600
there's these giant teams good versus evil what is evil people who did not have your best interest

46:17.600 --> 46:23.920
at heart people who don't believe in the species people who think that we are in the way people who

46:23.920 --> 46:32.880
want pain and suffering to occur if it's a choice between that and them getting something like a

46:32.880 --> 46:42.640
microwave oven I don't like like bad people uh like like you know what evil is you've seen it

46:43.760 --> 46:51.520
like it happens in the gaps between our choices it's it's not a there's these humans are monsters

46:51.520 --> 46:56.240
it's a it's a force it's a black cloud that overtakes you if you leave a vacuum where your

46:56.240 --> 47:02.640
soul's supposed to be it enters you and you do it's bidding you you it's it's it's you these there are

47:02.640 --> 47:08.320
some people that have been overtaken by this and their families have been overtaken by it

47:08.320 --> 47:13.680
and maybe they'll there'll be casualties in a war between good and evil but if you're good

47:15.840 --> 47:22.880
like you gotta even hope that they're redeemable let alone the fucking other good guy in the cockpit

47:22.880 --> 47:29.360
next to you of the millennium falcon get your shit together america all right

47:32.080 --> 47:36.560
i just don't i just when we got we got to this we right this is the road flare right

47:37.200 --> 47:43.040
they're kids it's a repeat for anyone my age you know what this is it's a repeat of columbine

47:43.840 --> 47:50.400
you we are all ashamed this blood is on our hands we saw this happen it's as if god picked

47:50.400 --> 47:58.000
the body counts so we could wake up like go oh this is identical everything else has changed

47:59.440 --> 48:07.920
i know like the blackbusters closed because videotape doesn't work anymore as as an industry

48:07.920 --> 48:14.960
but you could kill the same number of kids with the same device that just as easily and there's

48:14.960 --> 48:20.640
just as little legislation in the way that like like that the good guys should be the ones the

48:20.640 --> 48:27.120
most ashamed about this because we haven't fucking done anything we haven't laid down on railroad tracks

48:27.120 --> 48:37.520
yet and when you are a family or a survivor or a kid you come on like the tv and say something

48:38.080 --> 48:43.760
there's a platform of people that go your your actors like you're being paid yeah it's just

48:43.760 --> 48:49.120
like sandy hook there was all the crisis actor accusations around sandy hook those people are

48:49.120 --> 48:54.400
insane they're like the lowest of the orcs and then there's like these like uh udakai or whatever

48:54.400 --> 48:58.720
that are above them that are like no no i'm not saying it's a conspiracy but i'm just saying like

48:58.720 --> 49:04.720
these kids sure are sure happy they're enjoying the spotlight they're not uh they're not really

49:04.720 --> 49:14.640
it's like what the fuck are you doing the the children in your country they were not safe

49:15.520 --> 49:18.240
the you want to talk about the world laughing at us

49:19.280 --> 49:27.760
we don't have what the fuck country can you go to where children are this unsafe it's it's crazy

49:27.760 --> 49:34.320
and i mean let's not forget not just these guys are actors and aren't they looking happy but hey

49:34.960 --> 49:40.720
you should be killed you should fucking die i hope your whole family dies you should die

49:40.720 --> 49:47.840
go to hell i will kill you yeah which is a bit a bit farther than uh just this guy i saw him in

49:47.840 --> 49:53.760
california you know oh yeah all that crap so the the kids are getting their threats from

49:53.760 --> 49:59.440
oh yeah oh yeah their families everyone it's great oh yeah my favorite though was the guy

49:59.440 --> 50:05.520
i don't know who the fuck this guy was um but he his reaction was to say

50:07.520 --> 50:12.160
look at how disrespectful these children are talking to marco rubio look at how disrespectful

50:12.160 --> 50:18.880
they're being to the adults like i don't think that it's one person making this argument either

50:18.880 --> 50:23.920
it's a lot of people raising that question and it's and and then some guy did a poll about it which

50:23.920 --> 50:32.160
was like okay well how many people want their kids talking to adults like this and it backfired

50:32.160 --> 50:38.560
because everybody was like oh if my kids talked like this i'd buy them a car it turns out attacking

50:38.560 --> 50:46.240
massacre of his victims doesn't play well online and no it doesn't and and massacre or not who the

50:46.240 --> 50:51.200
fuck cares who talks to a senator like the piece of shit that every single one of them are by virtue

50:51.200 --> 50:56.720
of the vocation they chose this is a fucking america if you choose the occupation of politician

50:56.720 --> 51:02.400
you're human garbage get used to it and don't fucking expect to be worshiped you're a fucking

51:02.400 --> 51:08.000
piece of shit believe me the job comes with perks now eat my fucking shit and get back to work

51:08.000 --> 51:15.120
representing me these people aren't royalty it's it's fucking ridiculous when did we it's it's

51:15.120 --> 51:22.000
sane like like like we well you know i i swear to god i what we should do now that uh like

51:22.000 --> 51:28.000
what 40 percent of our country just thinks that the president is a king the office not even just

51:28.000 --> 51:32.480
the guy that's in there now but we just we just we just tend to look at this as like a popularity

51:32.480 --> 51:36.560
contest and then you're prom king of the country we should we should now if we're gonna save our

51:36.560 --> 51:43.920
country we should we should do this full circle thing where we emulate england make the office

51:43.920 --> 51:51.040
of president a symbolic title for a person that can go around the earth waving their hand in a

51:51.040 --> 51:58.400
weird way saying funny things at meetings and making big blustery speeches about what we stand for

51:58.400 --> 52:05.200
while a fucking person that went to law school or a group of people that knows how to run anything

52:05.200 --> 52:11.280
it can actually keep the country from from from going bankrupt like we just need we need a prime

52:11.280 --> 52:18.160
minister we we could we can call it a secretary of leadership someone who will never surrender

52:21.200 --> 52:25.920
i'm sorry to everyone listening who is only feeling the same thing and has said it a thousand

52:25.920 --> 52:30.720
times and it's not like i'm doing anything different i it was either this or i was just

52:30.720 --> 52:36.960
gonna you saw us sleepy i was at the top of the show i'm sitting i'm sitting on a fucking chair

52:36.960 --> 52:43.040
i'm sitting on a lot of anxiety and sadness it's not there's only one thing to talk about

52:43.040 --> 52:49.360
and it and it makes one sad so okay let's talk about the oscars and i'm just like

52:51.040 --> 52:58.240
i i just i just don't have the energy for it i i i don't i i i i i i i i want to go back in a

52:58.240 --> 53:07.280
time machine to the to the point i don't know when it was 2003 2001 i don't know when i when i

53:07.280 --> 53:14.640
started thinking of maybe i could care about this species like instead of just shunning the whole

53:14.640 --> 53:22.560
thing and like i just i just want to undo that mistake but i can't i have formed a relationship

53:22.560 --> 53:30.880
with your obnoxious moronic half ape species uh that that that does the dumbest shit and it just

53:30.880 --> 53:39.360
like i just like i i i i'm all of my money is tied into yours i my survival like i i didn't dig

53:39.360 --> 53:46.560
a hole in 2002 and like make a bat cave like i should have i i didn't i didn't i didn't focus

53:46.560 --> 53:55.360
all of my energy on being completely independent of you idiots but because i didn't i can't can't

53:55.360 --> 53:59.680
you just can't you get your can't you fucking figure it out can't you like touch a monolith

53:59.680 --> 54:04.960
and like evolve like like or there's somebody somebody do something

54:06.960 --> 54:14.160
there's 300 million of us and we're just making such an ass of ourselves our kids these are kids

54:14.160 --> 54:23.840
they're kids like we're we're eating our own children we're devouring them we're like feeding

54:23.840 --> 54:30.480
them into this blender it's it's like we don't we it was bad enough 20 years ago and it was like

54:30.480 --> 54:36.080
oh we started like like worshiping the sexuality of 14 year olds but more than we cared about the

54:36.080 --> 54:46.320
wisdom of a 40 year old like capitalism gonna capital like but it's now now we now we're just

54:46.960 --> 54:51.200
now we're just eating flesh we're just like worshiping a golden calf and just fucking

54:51.200 --> 54:58.080
eating eating flesh and fucking the bite hauls and it doesn't it's like like we have we are we are

54:58.080 --> 55:07.840
we are like guys don't make me yeah don't make me hide don't make me dig a hole and hide

55:09.200 --> 55:14.880
i'm five years from retirement get your shit together i actually i i mean as much as

55:16.400 --> 55:21.600
i go through like every thought that you're having like on a daily basis right now i was

55:21.600 --> 55:28.400
feeling a lot more hopeless before these kids did start speaking up of course and they're really

55:28.400 --> 55:34.080
inspiring right now and they've given me a hope for the future that i didn't have because i was

55:34.080 --> 55:40.320
really worried about the the next generation coming into adulthood and voting because it's

55:40.320 --> 55:46.480
right around the corner for them and if the rest of the teenagers of america are cutting through

55:46.480 --> 55:54.640
the bullshit as easily as these kids then we might actually be okay i'm not so convinced i just think

55:54.640 --> 56:03.200
you know they're excited now but it's not about being excited now it's about being willing to do

56:03.200 --> 56:09.280
very boring tedious time-consuming stuff for the course of several months three years from now

56:09.280 --> 56:14.880
you know and that's no yeah that's just a really hard thing yeah so that's yeah once we see that

56:14.880 --> 56:23.120
the cynic in me thinks that while all this awesome progressive revolutionary activist movement is

56:23.120 --> 56:29.200
happening among like high school kids there's a bunch of other kids who are going to perfect the

56:29.200 --> 56:35.760
art of being fascists and and perfect the art of running for office and being more subversive

56:35.760 --> 56:44.880
yeah and and like donald trump is a low-level fascist he's a he's a he's a clumsy like shitty sideshow

56:44.880 --> 56:53.280
version of of a muslimi there's there's some young girl or boy in in school go oh if i want to be

56:53.280 --> 57:00.000
president and be a horrible corrupt piece of shit all i have to do is uh pretend to tell the truth

57:00.000 --> 57:07.760
and like the more awful shit is to come by far there's no way that trump is the end of the road

57:07.760 --> 57:15.120
on oh we we had a we made a boo boo america we had a bad president we're gonna the next one's

57:15.120 --> 57:20.960
gonna be so much worse and we're gonna have to outgrow the idea that that the office of presidency

57:20.960 --> 57:28.720
means anything at all it's a stupid clerical office that shouldn't be a celebrity gig the idea

57:28.720 --> 57:35.440
that we need leaders is the idea that we're we've decided that we're going to be um ancient roam

57:36.080 --> 57:43.600
the republic must die so we can start worshiping dictators um the world is turning towards

57:43.600 --> 57:50.720
autocracy all over the world um the next generation of autocrats and oligarchs are

57:50.720 --> 57:55.520
going to be ours they're gonna be our children born in the fucking crucible of these fucking

57:55.520 --> 58:03.520
uh high school shootings and shit we've just proven to ourselves that democracy is uh awkward

58:03.520 --> 58:12.000
and untenable and the simpler thing is to let let uh dictators rule which is why goodness can't be

58:12.000 --> 58:18.880
shackled by politeness it can't be shackled by anything because the only chance that we have

58:18.880 --> 58:22.640
and i don't want to talk about it in terms of chances because the funny thing that happens is

58:22.640 --> 58:28.960
when you you know we all we also don't want to lose that we want to protect ourselves and that's

58:28.960 --> 58:35.520
how a third of us end up siding with apathy and entropy and again i just want to say to those

58:35.520 --> 58:44.560
people how about this how about we're going to lose how about we've already lost now the call

58:44.560 --> 58:52.160
to action to you is how do you want to go out do you want to kill a bunch of kids do you want to

58:53.040 --> 58:57.920
roll around in a pile of money that doesn't matter because it's all ending or do you want to find

58:57.920 --> 59:06.160
your style find your voice emerge from your uh defensive self-protective shell of apathy

59:07.360 --> 59:12.560
so that you can be right about everything because yeah everything always falls apart

59:12.560 --> 59:20.080
you if you stand back and say that i just i was that person too i still am that person i'm saying

59:20.080 --> 59:28.480
like now that it feels like it's really getting close to the end like for shits and giggles

59:30.240 --> 59:38.080
let's try some shit i don't know what that means but but i think these kids like the next generation

59:38.080 --> 59:44.720
is what church is saying is that thank god we actually see that you could shoot up a school

59:44.720 --> 59:50.640
and the kids that survive could actually turn out to have presence of mind concern for their fellow

59:50.640 --> 59:57.200
man i apparently forgiveness of the system that led them to the swatter enough that they would

59:57.200 --> 01:00:02.800
rather to try to reach out to it um they didn't all turn into little hitlers they didn't all

01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:07.040
turn into little beavers and buttheads they didn't turn into little sydvicious's they didn't turn

01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:15.680
into little rick sandcheses a handful of them at least turned into little uh activists activists

01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:21.120
and and and and we need 20 of them for every one of these people that jeff's talking about because

01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:26.560
of course they're gonna everybody that's grows up in this new world is gonna like the the the the

01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:33.520
the it's yeah the high iq fascists are coming and they're gonna i hope to see on you know

01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:41.440
march 24th the march for our lives um that there are more teenagers on board with this

01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:45.600
movement than or not and i think that that's what we're gonna see i think that it's gonna be

01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:52.240
i hope that it's going to be huge but already you know i mean kids are being told they can't

01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:56.800
go in protest like you're gonna get in trouble if you go in protest because you're gonna skip school

01:00:56.800 --> 01:01:03.280
whatever and kids are saying fuck you and so people are trying to keep these kids who want to

01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:09.760
join in the fight from doing it by saying follow the rules and they're not following the rules

01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:14.880
constitutional yeah i'm decided on a supreme court case if you're if you're one of these

01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:20.400
kids and you can hear me like you just yeah you can't you can't listen to any of us you can't

01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:24.400
it's right that's the thing because even us telling you this is us manipulating you and

01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:28.320
that's the one thing you shouldn't do is get co-opted by anybody because that's that will

01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:34.240
happen if you're successfully co-opted by alex baldwin then you become uh successfully dismissible

01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:38.800
as a pawn like if somebody if somebody starts funding you somebody starts if there's an adult

01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:44.080
at one of your meetings where you're planning a march or something uh then the enemy gets to

01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:50.480
rightfully say well these aren't real kids this is a children's crusade they're still

01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:55.920
fucking assholes well they're right they're they're they're they would be valid in saying that if

01:01:55.920 --> 01:02:02.000
someone bought bought them and started coordinating them saying kids um uh don't skip school we can

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:06.960
do it on a saturday afternoon my name is mr hendershaw and i'm the i'm the 48 year old liberal

01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:12.800
that's gonna like help you out thanks for thanks for having we we we was is it what an amazing

01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:20.000
concept 16 year old speaking up um um wow uh now let's use that to get maxine waters elected

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:25.040
like i just don't trust anybody kids like like because it won't it doesn't matter if their heart's

01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:29.920
in the right place or not your power right now is that you're all that we have left your power is

01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:35.680
that we is that you're supposed to be off of the monopoly board and and and the game has has become

01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:41.280
not a game anymore and you're the only thing that can help us think about the pressure uh what's

01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:48.080
what's the uh the uh i call bs girl's name uh emma gonzalez emma gonzalez she now has way

01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:55.200
more followers on twitter than the nr a and she's what 17 18 years old and the nr a has

01:02:55.200 --> 01:03:04.320
fucking dank ass memes too so to be able to to be that day the nr a has dank ass fucking dank

01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:13.680
ass memes bro there's our show title i don't know uh but like like she like she was eloquent

01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:22.480
in the in the face of a massacre and now she's going to be held to a horrible scrutiny of like

01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:31.920
like of asshole men and like men's rights activists and all this shit nr a fucking loony tunes like

01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:40.480
she now her life is now having to be famous for speaking up but also i think it's crazy

01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:48.000
that the idea that we have to worship leaders of any kind like i say pour all that energy to

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:54.000
protecting these kids and it really has to be literally protecting them it can't be helping

01:03:54.000 --> 01:04:01.280
them it has to be shielding them um because it it it's good to be disenfranchised by politicians

01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:07.600
and this is what happens to a society in in total crisis is that it's like it's like these kids are

01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:15.600
going to either be eaten alive um in which case the dragon's going to get even stronger

01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:20.080
and it's we'll just look at it as a children's crusade there was just the final death throes of

01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:26.320
sanity which we sent our children marching into into the fray and and because we were we were out

01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:32.960
of soldiers um or birming in alabama they sent the kids out to protest they all got hosed down and

01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:37.920
the dogs were sent on them and it was like a major turning point right these these these poor kids

01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:45.120
before anyone i'm 45 and i have i don't have a bone in my body that's prepared to make a sacrifice

01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:51.040
and these kids are 16 and they they they have to endure an actual christ myth like they have to

01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:57.520
actually atone with an with some fucking crazy garden of guest them any um uh impersonal force

01:04:57.520 --> 01:05:05.040
that answers by not answering when you say take this cup away uh and they they have to march

01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:12.560
forward to golgotha um knowing that there is no fucking like celebration at the end of it

01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:18.560
they got that is like like it's only going to be abuse as like you you're going to have your

01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:25.760
childhood taken away from you i i i i i think that happened when that's why if we if we care at all

01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:31.840
we have to just we have to just we have to just whatever this means figuratively we have to just

01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:39.200
gather around them in a giant bubble with our backs to them facing outward um while they do

01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:46.000
whatever they want to do until they drop dead from exhaustion and any bullet fired their direction

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:50.800
figuratively or literally hits one of us and that's what we have to do that's what's that's what's

01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:57.440
upon us in the face of this if we care i don't know what that means i don't know how that actually

01:05:57.440 --> 01:06:02.560
physically like expresses itself i don't know what to do i just feel like i just i just want

01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:13.440
these kids to understand like that you know sorry like like like start sorry that our football team

01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:19.760
so shitty that you're on the field with no equipment um and the ball is spiraling in the air

01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:26.000
and there's 400 linebackers headed towards you i don't know anything about football

01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:35.840
but uh should we just porch corner but but but i but i do know either either by virtue of the

01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:40.000
fact that we were we were never going to win or by virtue of the fact that this is the only way

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:44.000
we're going to win that this is this is all this is all we got and you're doing the right thing

01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:49.280
don't listen to your parents don't listen to your parents when they tell you they understand

01:06:49.280 --> 01:06:53.840
don't listen to your parents when they tell you uh that your life is going to be ruined uh don't

01:06:53.840 --> 01:07:01.200
don't don't don't listen to them don't don't don't let them trick you in any way you have to use them

01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:08.640
you have to love them like but don't let them get in your head because they don't have the

01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:15.840
answers i am your parents age i did nothing i watched i watched all you kids die when you were my age

01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:27.520
age and and i did nothing so don't listen to us accept support not advice is my advice if someone

01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:36.400
says here's $500 make them sign a thing that says it's it's it's a gift i don't i don't know i i i

01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:39.840
guess actually spin on it and throw it back on their face because they've already taken like

01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:46.880
two and a half million dollars sorry i thought that was a joke no no yeah um that's what i mean

01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:53.760
it's like it doesn't invalidate them to take money it's like give them money no they're a movement now

01:07:53.760 --> 01:08:00.240
and movements need to raise funds to keep going you can't do this shit forever for free luckily

01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:05.360
they've grown up in a world where it's like you can just go online and become this character and

01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:10.320
make a living that way so they do kind of see this pathway but it's not just like they're not

01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:15.840
just you know like oh how do i become a public figure you know it's like they've seen people

01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:21.680
their age being public figures for years and years and they have a great reason to uh be out there

01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:28.960
you know i hope we're we're we're dying empire it happens we had a good run uh we're portugal

01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:36.160
we're we're we're england we're spain we're we ruled the world for a couple hundred years and it's

01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:41.600
over and we're not going to go gracefully into that good night we're not going to go gently

01:08:42.320 --> 01:08:49.360
what we're going to do is grab and profiteer as much as we can we're going to we're going to take

01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:55.680
like the the people in power are going to steal as much as they can and then go team up with the

01:08:55.680 --> 01:09:02.560
next new empire be that china or russia or north korea or whatever the fuck like like we did it

01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:10.800
we're done we're fucked you can't be um a thousand year empire you can't be a rike that goes on for

01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:18.080
fucking on and on and on uh we blew it we had a chance we did kind of a good job we made a lot

01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:23.280
of white people rich uh we made a lot of black people unhappy and now we don't care about the

01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:28.880
murder of our own children this is the end we actually had a pretty short run yeah it should

01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:35.120
have been shorter we we've squandered a lot of it we're we're we're too greedy which we we we

01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:39.120
well i don't think it's also a global phenomenon what's happening right now it's not just our it's

01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:45.680
not just our american empire that's just because we lasted 200 years compared to i mean in rome

01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:53.760
like you would go six generations before you got your mail like everything moved at the

01:09:53.760 --> 01:10:01.920
speed of a campfire so like i i you know if you adjust for technological inflation we we were

01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:09.440
oh yeah i yeah exactly like if it took 30 years to build an aqueduct 200 years managing eight

01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:17.680
billion people uh yeah and all their money we burned brighter we burned faster we burned out

01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:21.920
and i i don't think there's any shame in that i think what you do is you go fuck it we're

01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:26.480
we're portugal and now let's go out as the empire that at the at the eleventh hour

01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:34.560
like uh fucking arnold and terminator two giving the thumbs up like like that thumb is we love our

01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:44.720
edward furlongs we love our kids like we were we lost we don't stop it change that quit it jeff

01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:52.640
love kids i'm i'm i'm i'm agreeing with you you're right we we won't put that thumb up as we go down

01:10:52.640 --> 01:11:00.720
into the uh into the thing we support david hog 1111 that's his that that's his twitter handle

01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:07.440
uh i don't think there's any shame in just saying like we are a great empire in a long

01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:13.440
line of great empires that had their run and it's over like we like now let's try to find a graceful

01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:20.640
way to enter into the next like into our middle age or we still got it come on man we win it back

01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:27.600
the shame is in is in is in looting what what because we see that like the shame is inciting

01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:33.200
with entropy it doesn't matter if entropy is going to win or not the shame is inciting with it i also

01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:38.960
think that there's there's two things that kind of led to what's going on right now and you can

01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:43.440
look back at realm for this example as well as one is the disbelief that it's even possible that

01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:50.080
this can happen like there's this notion of american superiority and this american dream idea this ideal

01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:56.720
that we're all kind of uh raised with that says like well america can never fail it will always

01:11:56.720 --> 01:12:02.000
work out it will always work out so there's a sense of denial uh in the american spirit

01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:06.960
that really is in disbelief of what's actually happening right now and then also on the flip

01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:10.560
side there's also the people who are like oh it's you know it's always been fucked up and it's

01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:15.280
gonna be fucked up and whatever it's over it's been over and why bother trying to change it

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:22.480
so in between those two perspectives are people who might actually try to do something to make

01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:30.960
something better right now despite all evidence that it's either futile or whatever and you know

01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:37.120
these kids are trying and maybe they maybe they succeed and maybe we can turn it around i think

01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:43.360
it's worth yeah jack quick doubting the kids it's well it's worth a fucking shot right i believe

01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:47.680
in kids there's a whole generation coming up right now we're about to see what happens where we have

01:12:47.680 --> 01:12:53.600
to like pick a new leader like like oh it's going to be this person that's going to save us there's

01:12:53.600 --> 01:13:00.800
going to be one new like figurehead that's going to save democracy that's crazy right that approaches

01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:09.200
flawed yeah yeah and so like like yes turn out go vote go change in uh you know at the midterms

01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:15.920
like like go go make things happen but also don't root for your next bernie sanders or hillary or

01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:22.800
or trump or whoever like the idea that we have to pick one person to make things all right to be the

01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:29.280
leader like of our rock band uh it's crazy but i don't see that happening what i see is a lot of

01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:33.840
people suddenly actually getting involved in their local governments holding their representatives

01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:38.560
accountable starting to go to these town hall meetings starting to make phone calls all shit

01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:43.120
like that we've learned in the last year more than we ever knew before about how government works

01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:47.680
because of this catastrophe we are sort of there is a silver lining here with trump is a sort of

01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:53.680
like he's a rodeo clown and he's a as jeff says he's a amateurs autocrat yeah he also is sort of

01:13:53.680 --> 01:14:00.000
like a thinly veiled drape over the fact if we play our cards right if we get through this it could

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:05.520
be the way that we realize the important thing which is that the office of the president is not

01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:12.400
is not supposed to be empowered and isn't that empowered that that that we are a republic and

01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:17.680
that our representatives in all of this is this fucked up cheer system that this is an incredibly

01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:24.240
important this this should be like underpaid low-level nerds that take care of us that you

01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:28.640
can tell to go fuck themselves because if they can't handle being talked to by a 16 year old

01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:34.320
that's just been shot at by an air 15 like they're a fucking moron then they don't qualify for the

01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:40.800
job get me in get me a fucking accountant in that office get me a lawyer in that office so i i have

01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:46.640
a million people on my payroll who know full well that that that that whether they like me or not

01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:50.880
they could go home and fantasize about me falling downstairs and breaking my neck but during the

01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:56.000
10 minute phone call about my taxes they go absolutely absolutely that's what you're supposed

01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:02.720
to say to the american public if you're a fucking congress person and and and these these are the

01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:09.120
people that are important and and and they need to stop fucking acting like just because they're

01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:15.840
below the radar that they're like not capable of shitting up our country and they're they're

01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:22.080
being held accountable for the first time ever because also with such an inept leader which

01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:27.600
is where everyone usually is looking is that the the the you know the the wizard of Oz sitting up

01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:31.840
on top of the hill is supposed to be the source of everything meanwhile there's all these other

01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:36.640
cogs in the machine that no one's really thinking are very important and they never are in their own

01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:41.040
damn states they're not actually talking to the people that they represent they're all up in

01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:46.720
washington talking to lobbyists and shit so now that we have this inept guy in the office of the

01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:53.200
presidency suddenly people going wait how does this work okay so i have to deal with my state

01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:57.280
legislators and okay who are they where do i find the directory for the people i call about this

01:15:57.280 --> 01:16:02.720
shit that's happening we need campaign reform so fucking bad it's it's it's been the most ludicrous

01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:07.120
journey it's just like going like over and over again 85 percent of the american public

01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:14.320
87 percent um that you better believe that includes all the fucking people that hate each other

01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:20.160
all agree campaign reform i don't know who the fuck these 15 percent are i guess they're probably

01:16:20.160 --> 01:16:25.520
the fucking parasites the the the rich people and but everyone else is like yeah you gotta get money

01:16:25.520 --> 01:16:31.520
out of politics you just gotta get it out it's not it doesn't work and then so okay what's the first

01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:37.600
step well let's make a law against money in politics okay let's take that vote uh come to order all

01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:44.160
the people it's an absurd it's like a comedy sketch like but we got to that poor mailman who

01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:50.080
rode his helicopter bike under the front steps of the capital law and whatever the that it was

01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:55.600
just like i just he had one message campaign reform we need that so bad it would solve every other

01:16:55.600 --> 01:17:02.480
problem make these people civil servants make that make this job that you know why tv is good now

01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:08.320
because they're getting so many channels so many ways to watch tv that all the shit-faced

01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:16.640
coke addict fucking uh suit clad assholes that never gave a fuck about what you watched on television

01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:24.160
and looked at tv as a great way to fuck actresses and make a bunch of money their salaries didn't

01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:31.120
get very high like like they started getting bored and they left and breaking bad happened

01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:38.320
like like that is what you do to this country if you want to save it you suck the fucking money

01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:43.680
out of the spots that are important you suck the capitalism out of the things that are crucial

01:17:43.680 --> 01:17:52.400
education medicine uh and for my money the transformers franchise hell yeah what about

01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:56.400
the you know what that should never have been a for-profit venture these are robots that turn

01:17:56.400 --> 01:18:01.920
into cars okay this belongs to the people what's up with pacific rim is pacific rim about transformers

01:18:01.920 --> 01:18:06.480
is that i don't know the specific rims about transformers it's also about godzillas

01:18:06.480 --> 01:18:15.440
any other questions you actually answered all my questions hell yeah

01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:23.440
in the future humans fight godzillas with giant robots um the place where i turned it off is when

01:18:23.440 --> 01:18:30.720
they started talking about how you need two pilots one to to balance the mental strain of the link

01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:37.840
that felt are we talking about transformers or pacific rims that's pacific rims okay like when

01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:42.560
they started backpiping this shit about how you always need two pilots i'm like well i smell a rat

01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:48.880
here uh plot wise like i feel like something's being forced on to me that stuff like that always

01:18:48.880 --> 01:18:54.000
pisses me off because it's like i know how machines work like i know how today's machines work like

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:57.920
you can't say you can't put a steering wheel on a fucking giant robot isn't like a producer

01:18:57.920 --> 01:19:02.560
meeting where they said like come on we need to say hello to your new partner scene well right

01:19:02.560 --> 01:19:09.040
was the partner the robot no the robot's a car well who's the partner then does he drive the feet

01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:14.400
i don't know what if it's just the emotional strain yeah there's two partners they both do it

01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:20.000
finally we protected the say hello to your new partner scene the lynch pin of all great movies

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:29.280
have you seen these movies do you know i turned it off when they started with they in the big the

01:19:29.280 --> 01:19:35.680
movie begins the first movie begins with like fucking lord of the rings like vio doesn't

01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:42.000
first there was an ocean then the godzillas came and then we found out we needed two pilots one

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:47.840
to handle the mental strain and i was like click because i was like i i got a heart no time i would

01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:53.440
watch that movie if you if they were that honest about it first there was notion then the godzillas

01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:58.880
you you know why you'd keep watching because you'd go finally a movie cutting to the fucking business

01:19:58.880 --> 01:20:05.680
yes so if the third thing they said was every robot of course needs two pilots let me finish the uh

01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:12.880
you'd go okay you fucked up our relationship you came in here with like fucking sexy pants and

01:20:12.880 --> 01:20:18.400

and there was some people running and we had a dude and there was a shambling mask and uh yeah

01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:53.040

if you could win like if you could accept one oscar what category like if you were up there

01:22:49.440 --> 01:22:57.120
tonight what oscar would be the dream like category for you to accept one academy award

01:22:57.120 --> 01:23:07.600
what would the category be like it could be actor it could be supporting actor producer

01:23:07.600 --> 01:23:15.200
it's hard it's hard there's the there's the the the the one that i actually think i'm like if you

01:23:15.200 --> 01:23:23.440
know my cards are played right eventually i guess i could win the like producing best picture

01:23:23.440 --> 01:23:28.800
yeah best picture yeah you know that that could be but like what would be your like that might

01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:33.200
be the most likely or right is that the one that you want the most or would you like to just be

01:23:34.240 --> 01:23:38.800
yeah some other category i guess either that or best actor right those are the two best biggest

01:23:38.800 --> 01:23:45.520
ones what was the question i was texting a guy that's down i'll ask you the same question since

01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:55.040
you were texting a guy well that's obvious which category pick any oscar category what would be

01:23:55.040 --> 01:24:00.480
the one that you would like to win like if you were up there tonight accepting an award obviously

01:24:00.480 --> 01:24:09.600
costume design i knew it i knew it like nobody ever does it right they don't understand you gotta

01:24:09.600 --> 01:24:15.840
make you gotta make really big uh poofy hoop skirts you gotta make the poofy hoop skirt super

01:24:15.840 --> 01:24:21.920
high colors i think it could win a best original screenplay oscar i don't even like your tone

01:24:23.920 --> 01:24:30.880
like is this something about your tone the he might be able to get like fifth the best movie

01:24:30.880 --> 01:24:36.560
what i what i what i what i what i heard in that was that i that the the lazy writer that it's

01:24:36.560 --> 01:24:42.480
probably won't know you're kind of like i think i think dan could i think i could do it no that's

01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:51.120
not no of course i could do it question is will i answers no because i'm retiring in five years i

01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:55.280
control i still think you are you retiring because you don't think you're good enough to win best

01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:02.720
best original screenplay that's what he told me i found out tv is a better racket than movies you

01:25:02.720 --> 01:25:10.400
know i'm i'm i'm as long as i got my pride spencer how about you what category best supporting

01:25:10.400 --> 01:25:17.360
actress right what are we talking about i was i was gonna say the same thing went by the way

01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:22.240
with all of our our non-binary uh revolution what are we what are we gonna chop into that with an

01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:33.360
ice pick what well the concept that that that acting is divided by gender two genders instead of yeah

01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:41.600
i mean what oh shit yeah well yeah how far away are we from like like best act like whatever the

01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:47.200
pronoun probably just actor right like like like like but without yeah without having this like

01:25:47.200 --> 01:25:52.960
actress and actress and well i i mean the thing that will make that happen is when somebody is a

01:25:52.960 --> 01:26:01.280
trans character that wins best transgender role and they can't say best actor or actress well

01:26:01.280 --> 01:26:06.240
in you know in most cases they will be able to because they'll be identifying as either a man

01:26:06.240 --> 01:26:13.840
or a woman right so that it have to be a very specific like a gender trans person yeah we got

01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:20.960
some time i wonder who won best cisgender male tonight yeah so yeah we will never give in yet

01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:26.320
we will always be cisgender

01:26:29.440 --> 01:26:36.000
i am coming out in a state of heteronormative nature yes i will be headed we will be heteronormative

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:41.440
on the beaches we will be heteronormative in the fields we'll be heteronormative on the landing

01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:45.920
grounds we'll always be cisgender did that thing really happen where he got on the subway and asked

01:26:45.920 --> 01:26:50.560
everybody whether no it didn't happen he didn't get on the goddamn subway pole

01:26:52.560 --> 01:27:00.240
hello governor i'm a fucking uh my name is roger jones that's bullshit never if it happened

01:27:00.240 --> 01:27:07.280
fuck you it certainly if it happened fuck you it certainly didn't happen on his way back to the

01:27:07.280 --> 01:27:12.320
house of lords to go deliver that speech where he goes you know what i just talked to eight people

01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:17.920
that weren't rich people and they really fucking well i also did the funny thing about that about

01:27:17.920 --> 01:27:23.200
that scene is that it's used as if it's a plot point but what he does with that information is he goes

01:27:23.200 --> 01:27:31.600
he goes back to his political parasite friends and says i i talked to mary joe peasley and

01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:38.560
geronimo johnson and and and and and they take his word for it and it's almost like it's almost

01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:44.640
i think maybe the story is that he said i once he won best actor well that's what i'm saying

01:27:44.640 --> 01:27:50.000
i mean he just he just won it he won it like 25 minutes ago fuck him but but but but but but

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:55.360
that's what i'm saying yeah i think that's is that that was that was the actual point of the story

01:27:55.360 --> 01:28:01.520
is that he whether he did it or not he said he did it so if he didn't do it the story is that he

01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:07.680
lied they probably truncated the fact that he actually did go listen to some like common people

01:28:08.480 --> 01:28:13.920
and do it but the fact that he went on a subway and then that was what made that speech happen i

01:28:13.920 --> 01:28:20.240
find a little like it's another one of those things where i what was the other thing sometimes i see

01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:25.680
something oh it was like it was the uh cheeseburger phone calling frost nixon i i where i'm like

01:28:25.680 --> 01:28:34.720
that's so like jammed down the muzzle that it either has to be true or it's like the crazy egregious

01:28:34.720 --> 01:28:40.960
you gotta jam it down the muzzle all right dan pass down those uh those character sheets

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:50.640
spencer hey guys please do me a favor no and fill me back in on what the hell

01:28:50.640 --> 01:28:58.640
all had gone on recently okay awesome campaign well and and tell you what don't play your music

01:28:58.640 --> 01:29:02.480
cue so that he feels like he has to perform it let him

01:29:07.840 --> 01:29:12.640
eat dinosaurs if you want information and you want it to be good let them fucking yeah

01:29:13.600 --> 01:29:18.720
spencer did you add a sheet to our um yeah i think dan had that sheet but i'm gonna give it to you

01:29:18.720 --> 01:29:23.680
because you're more fastidious oh it's the group loot sheet it's our group loot

01:29:25.680 --> 01:29:33.440
all right spencer refresh our memories please all right you guys were in dore nester on the

01:29:33.440 --> 01:29:39.920
quest for patching's gem you infiltrated the town to get information and you found some

01:29:39.920 --> 01:29:46.720
information that seemed to link this mysterious theater that seemed to be some sort of institution

01:29:46.720 --> 01:29:53.760
in the town to shrove and also information that said that shrove might be in the bathroom of a

01:29:53.760 --> 01:29:59.520
tavern so you decided to have juxtro from the tavern after the tavern master told you that

01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:05.440
that would be a bad idea and it resulted in a big brawl so you guys escaped from the brawl and the

01:30:05.440 --> 01:30:13.120
brawl followed you outside into a back alley where uh you guys escaped um after jeff started a fire

01:30:13.120 --> 01:30:19.360
and then dan used like uh essentially a flash bomb like a like a like a blinding light to cover your

01:30:19.360 --> 01:30:26.400
exit um then you met up with a shambling mound who took you to safety in uh that was north of a pig

01:30:26.400 --> 01:30:34.480
farm in the wall of the city the Schrab here right now um well he's not in the building uh yeah

01:30:34.480 --> 01:30:41.360
Schrabs here quiet yeah he's just doing that thing he does where he he's in stealth Schrab mode he's

01:30:41.360 --> 01:30:48.720
in silent running the well-known secret Schrab there's a well-known behaviors of Schrab that was

01:30:48.720 --> 01:30:56.560
my fault that was a dumb question it's fine so uh yeah you were north of of uh yeah this pig farm

01:30:56.560 --> 01:31:02.480
in this kind of wreckage of a wall that he was calling a house and it had a window in it um

01:31:02.480 --> 01:31:08.880
so you had shrove you started i'll say interrogating although that's a really loose way to refer to it

01:31:08.880 --> 01:31:14.720
ouch um to everyone's a critic i am yeah no that's that's most of my job is critiquing what you guys

01:31:14.720 --> 01:31:21.840
are doing and being frustrated um so we didn't torture him good enough i we we he had a feel

01:31:21.840 --> 01:31:26.640
like you might have a dragon tattoo on his back was that important did we they hit a hit a dragon

01:31:26.640 --> 01:31:31.440
mark tattoo well i did say it so yeah it was a dragon tattoo that we identified with one of gary

01:31:31.440 --> 01:31:38.240
shamblings books as being part of this dragon cult that uh dragon mark not a cult so wait well it's a

01:31:38.240 --> 01:31:46.720
dr and we asked him as uh can he read the uh guild script in the uh note so he translated the note

01:31:46.720 --> 01:31:52.320
and and he wouldn't he stopped short of giving us the location of the drop point for pachens gem

01:31:52.320 --> 01:31:59.280
right he but we know that the note had a drop point and that the time was within hours and gary

01:31:59.280 --> 01:32:04.640
it was drop point north right yeah and Garry Shandling also had a map that had all of like a

01:32:04.640 --> 01:32:08.960
list of locations in or around the town and it was written in that guild language so you couldn't

01:32:08.960 --> 01:32:13.920
read it but it also seemed to have locations on it is Garry is Garry Shandling still with us right now

01:32:13.920 --> 01:32:20.400
you just asked that answer me again well i'll get there well let them let them go finish the yeah

01:32:20.400 --> 01:32:27.520
so you guys had that you were on the cusp of making a big discovery and um then instead of holding

01:32:27.520 --> 01:32:33.120
him i think i think you switched to tying him up but uh dan had steve tie him up and steve did a

01:32:33.120 --> 01:32:38.480
bad job tying him up so he ended up just kind of slipping out of his bindings and sneaking out of

01:32:38.480 --> 01:32:42.240
the window although it would be fair when he started sneaking out of the window you guys kind

01:32:42.240 --> 01:32:46.480
of just let him leave like you didn't chase him or like try and grab i can speak to that

01:32:47.680 --> 01:32:54.160
i think your memory is you're kind of looking back on it going am i a great dungeon master

01:32:54.880 --> 01:33:00.720
and you're gonna tend to go yeah no i think i'm terrible well here's what happened it was a bit of

01:33:00.720 --> 01:33:10.880
a fracas right we were beating him um yeah and he according to you he fucking like ninjaed out of

01:33:10.880 --> 01:33:16.720
his ropes and started beating the fuck out of us i don't think revealing himself to be super

01:33:17.920 --> 01:33:24.400
powerful and then he like blew out the window like a goddamn pixie i like like it was it was

01:33:24.400 --> 01:33:28.320
you're making it seem like we watched him slowly crawl out the window like this guy

01:33:28.320 --> 01:33:33.360
like like revealed that he had like npc powers that were like you're never supposed to kill me i'm

01:33:33.360 --> 01:33:37.760
supposed to fucking kill you and it's jump jump and it was like yeah i was like and then he like

01:33:37.760 --> 01:33:42.400
jumped out the window like a laser beam i don't i mean i'll believe you if you say he attacked but

01:33:42.400 --> 01:33:46.400
i don't remember him attacking you i just remember you guys all had combat turns i didn't try and i

01:33:46.400 --> 01:33:53.280
grab him down that this is trove won't cooperate we beat him up yeah he for sure kicked our ass

01:33:53.280 --> 01:33:57.680
he took a piece out of us i think he fought you pretty hard when you initially fought him in the

01:33:57.680 --> 01:34:02.240
dark but i don't remember him fighting you really hard enough but i can't i was already almost dead

01:34:02.240 --> 01:34:07.360
which is why that's the problem yeah yeah that that's the thing is you're already almost dead

01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:15.840
so he escaped into the night um i also have written down spencer in my notes that the top

01:34:15.840 --> 01:34:22.640
priority is the purse that was the light that was what the note said the note said the purse the

01:34:22.640 --> 01:34:30.160
purse is up the the purse is the gem drop point north is the town of door naster uh all right go

01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:37.520
ahead um so then you guys you were like i don't know what we should do and um then pat no not

01:34:37.520 --> 01:34:43.200
patching steve was like uh i know what we should do ask more questions and you went to the store

01:34:43.200 --> 01:34:48.240
owner and the store owner was like i don't know and then he sprayed you in the face with presumably

01:34:48.240 --> 01:34:53.760
knockout juice and uh you guys were like we love this adventure we're on and we want to keep doing

01:34:53.760 --> 01:35:00.720
the adventures forever well i mean are you is that your way of giving us a second chance no no that

01:35:00.720 --> 01:35:06.480
was just my memory are you doing it bit are you guys doing a bit where you pretend not to remember

01:35:06.480 --> 01:35:10.720
anything that happened but then suddenly have perfect memory of certain moments i do have

01:35:10.720 --> 01:35:15.520
perfect memory of one aspect of it which is that i fully fucking bailed in humiliation

01:35:15.520 --> 01:35:20.480
and i i was like i don't know what i'm doing we fucked up at the house where we set the

01:35:20.480 --> 01:35:24.400
guy's house on fire we fucked up here again and i started walking down the road with my

01:35:24.400 --> 01:35:31.360
compatriots and one of them the erstwhile diarrhea jr doubled back over our protests to go to go

01:35:31.360 --> 01:35:37.040
fucking hang out hang out in a town that nobody likes us in that we're we just yeah and and that

01:35:37.040 --> 01:35:42.880
was the way we ended it is that jeff and i were like on the road and we had told this kid don't

01:35:42.880 --> 01:35:48.000
go back and he went back and then you told him he got captured and then that's where we had said

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:53.440
fuck i don't remember fuck passions gem we're gonna go back to town and start start a new right

01:35:53.440 --> 01:35:58.960
well i'm very happy to rewind a little bit so that we're not on the road leaving town because

01:35:58.960 --> 01:36:07.840
i feel like the benefit of a month of thinking about our decisions is like well is dry there's

01:36:07.840 --> 01:36:14.320
a drop point in in doran ester drop point north we did we're on the quest for passions gem passions

01:36:14.320 --> 01:36:21.040
gem is being dropped off like like so i don't know where you want to place us and i gave my version

01:36:21.040 --> 01:36:26.720
and yeah what do you want to definitely call it quits and i ran back i don't remember how do you

01:36:26.720 --> 01:36:32.800
want to how do you want to you're outside of town well that okay yeah so we have left uh

01:36:32.800 --> 01:36:38.880
diary a jr behind because he wanted to fucking interrogate people back in no you don't leave

01:36:38.880 --> 01:36:43.920
him behind you guys were leaving he was like you know what fuck this i'm a young upstart with nothing

01:36:43.920 --> 01:36:49.200
to lose or you know whatever like the kids like the kids from the shooting yeah that was when i

01:36:49.200 --> 01:36:54.720
originally started writing this adventure i was like one of these days is gonna be a setup this is

01:36:54.720 --> 01:37:00.960
gonna be a socially resonant metaphor all right well it hit it hit home wait are so did we bail

01:37:00.960 --> 01:37:07.760
on passions gem didn't we decide i did yes i'm not i'm not willing to corroborate that well i did

01:37:07.760 --> 01:37:12.800
we were on the road outside of town because i said let's just just get out of here it's the

01:37:12.800 --> 01:37:18.480
reason i ran back into town i don't want to give up on it the area juniors is still on the quest

01:37:18.480 --> 01:37:24.720
for passions gem you and i said fuck it let's just restart let's let's hit control alternate

01:37:24.720 --> 01:37:32.000
let's go somewhere else yeah do another thing but okay so where where are we standing right now

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:38.080
Spencer uh you're outside of the town it's surrounded by a big thick wall that's about 10

01:37:38.080 --> 01:37:43.840
15 feet tall so it's like you're kind of outside it's a day or night it's nighttime it's dark um

01:37:43.840 --> 01:37:50.960
it's it's being lit by the flickering light of a town on fire are we on foot um me me and carlos

01:37:50.960 --> 01:37:56.720
you're on foot yeah yeah there's a town i said to carlos carlos i feel bad that dj is back

01:37:56.720 --> 01:38:05.600
in town we like we're nothing if not a team we're not even good as a team but we're worse alone

01:38:06.400 --> 01:38:16.240
we should go get dj back right look or don't look i mean i it's nighttime i'm not a good leader

01:38:16.240 --> 01:38:24.400
like i i i i fucked up i just i just but i we were we were a team walking out of town

01:38:24.400 --> 01:38:30.960
and then diarrhea went back like he shouldn't have we told him not to okay i he'd be standing

01:38:30.960 --> 01:38:38.320
with us right now if we if he had been a team i whistle i do like a like i can't do it i put

01:38:38.320 --> 01:38:43.600
my fingers in the mouth and do a whistle that i think that diarrhea junior would recognize you make

01:38:43.600 --> 01:38:51.920
the whistle yeah no you hear nothing he's all right well we we have to we have to get our ducks in

01:38:51.920 --> 01:38:59.600
a row about this uh this this drop point like it's if we're if we're gonna complete the quest

01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:09.680
for pachens gem it is upon us i would argue that uh diarrhea junior even it's like secondary to it

01:39:09.680 --> 01:39:15.280
because the deadline for one of them is within hours that's the one thing that we knew and we

01:39:15.280 --> 01:39:22.400
just don't know where in door nester uh the the drop point for the gem is drop point north we have

01:39:22.400 --> 01:39:27.600
to find drop i believe drop point north is door nester and it's the actual location within door

01:39:27.600 --> 01:39:33.440
nester that he wouldn't give us he read it and he wouldn't give it to us he's he's using that dragon

01:39:33.440 --> 01:39:42.560
mark uh knowledge to read the thing he saw crucial information i mean obviously he has

01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:51.520
more loyalty to his kind i guess that would make him a person to follow if we could figure out where

01:39:51.520 --> 01:40:06.400
he would go who uh shrove shrove yeah it'd go to the theater i mean drop point north if i'm a if i'm

01:40:06.400 --> 01:40:15.440
a band of shitty people that doesn't mind killing people to get a gem and then i'm arranging to

01:40:15.440 --> 01:40:27.600
drop it off and i mean where do you go i have no idea we can't go back into town they all know us

01:40:29.840 --> 01:40:37.920
we can't go back to door nester i think we just we just set it on fire and and and uh i just i

01:40:37.920 --> 01:40:44.880
mean maybe the passions gem thing was just a wild goose chase maybe we just all right you know what

01:40:45.920 --> 01:40:56.720
let's split the difference let's go rescue shitface shitface diarrhea the kid that he's your friend

01:40:56.720 --> 01:41:04.400
do you call him a shitface now he doesn't he went back i was told him not to i just whistled he

01:41:04.400 --> 01:41:10.560
didn't respond but maybe he's having a good time it means he's let's go let's go sneak back into town

01:41:10.560 --> 01:41:16.480
do you have any way of disguising people huh just stealthing them you are wearing like a weird clown

01:41:16.480 --> 01:41:21.040
outfit that you buy i'm wearing a weird clown outfit maybe maybe you should take that off because

01:41:21.040 --> 01:41:27.120
it's right we're wearing when we set fire to the town and i go back in my regular colorful uh

01:41:27.120 --> 01:41:35.920
numb druid cool i cast appear as someone else i don't think you have it okay all right just

01:41:35.920 --> 01:41:45.440
it's a good spell though all right yeah meanwhile um diarrhea you get sprayed in the face um

01:41:46.560 --> 01:41:53.200
biochemical what's your fortitude save do you know where saves are uh on the left side

01:41:53.200 --> 01:41:58.240
maybe a third of the way down yeah it says total is three okay

01:42:00.720 --> 01:42:05.600
all right you can feel yourself getting woozy as you lose consciousness

01:42:08.480 --> 01:42:15.360
oh boy you're out cold he got sprayed by what by uh chemical like a guy sprayed him with something

01:42:15.360 --> 01:42:23.200
because he was back there trying to talk shit and make friends yeah he was asked he was talking to a

01:42:23.200 --> 01:42:30.160
store owner all right soon after or you know an indiscriminate amount of time or an indeterminate

01:42:30.160 --> 01:42:35.280
amount of time afterwards you wake up in a wooden room lit by candles the wooden room you can tell

01:42:35.280 --> 01:42:40.640
the walls are are these black stained wooden planks and the smell of this room is a bit wet and

01:42:40.640 --> 01:42:47.680
earthy kind of musty um you're tied up with just so much really heavy rope you're in like a place

01:42:47.680 --> 01:42:52.400
where there's kind of it looks maybe like a lounge area there's like couches and a card table and

01:42:52.400 --> 01:42:57.360
you see about three people in the room oh and then there's also you see patches who's he's tied

01:42:57.360 --> 01:43:01.760
up as badly as you but he's knocked out and he's across across the room like you're on opposing

01:43:01.760 --> 01:43:08.320
walls um so yeah there's a fire and there's a door in one direction in a hallway in one direction

01:43:08.320 --> 01:43:12.080
and you can also see a big bulletin on the bullboard on the wall and a target and they're

01:43:12.080 --> 01:43:18.160
kind of full of knives is this is this so much later that i mean shouldn't we i mean if he was

01:43:18.160 --> 01:43:28.400
unconscious for a while shouldn't we you didn't care about him in in x amount of time so the

01:43:28.400 --> 01:43:34.880
scene we just had was time shifted okay that was just not caring about him well it was yeah it was

01:43:34.880 --> 01:43:40.000
yeah like the time it took us to walk outside of town yeah because he ran back in and he were like

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:45.040

and out of doran ester or you could like climb over the wall or something yeah i mean what is the

01:46:40.640 --> 01:46:45.920
main entrance guarded uh it's usually guarded but because of the fire the guards are helping with

01:46:45.920 --> 01:46:52.560
the fire all right well looks like we can go on through we can sneak in where is he we're we're

01:46:52.560 --> 01:46:55.280

yeah so we remember where the theater is right we had there okay you go to the theater it's a

01:47:07.600 --> 01:47:12.880
large black modern looking building made out of black stained planks there's uh the large front

01:47:12.880 --> 01:47:18.720
door is uh is closed as it was before all right i don't recommend we knock

01:47:18.720 --> 01:47:30.320

01:47:30.320 --> 01:47:38.080
i use my uh lock i don't know that you have thieves tools or anything let's look around the

01:47:38.080 --> 01:47:44.560
building for other points of ingress okay all right around the back you can see there seems

01:47:44.560 --> 01:47:49.200
like a little kind of kitchen area there's a small door and it's got a couple windows that's

01:47:49.200 --> 01:47:55.200
how you can see there's like it looks kind of like a kitchen there's uh kitcheny stuff i try to open

01:47:55.200 --> 01:48:00.480
one of the windows uh it's locked is there anybody uh in the kitchen uh no it seems like

01:48:00.480 --> 01:48:06.400
it's uh pretty quiet inside try the small door uh it's locked i take my quarter staff and break

01:48:06.400 --> 01:48:15.520
a window and then i can clear out the glass we can crawl through all right you do it it's great you

01:48:15.520 --> 01:48:21.360
punch a hole clean through the window it's just like it's uh it's not like a big shattering it's

01:48:21.360 --> 01:48:25.440
just kind of like you just knocked a big chunk out of the glass and it just kind of landed on

01:48:25.440 --> 01:48:31.760
the floor in one big piece perfect yeah you open the window can you when you get through can you

01:48:31.760 --> 01:48:36.960
open the door for me yeah i i crawl through and open the window for him hell yeah that happens now

01:48:36.960 --> 01:48:42.960
you're in a kitchen you see sausages and cheese oh yeah i take i take two sausages and one cheese

01:48:43.680 --> 01:48:52.240
okay just just in case that's fair all right uh what's our plan our plan is to find diarrhea

01:48:52.240 --> 01:49:03.760
junior or shrove well yeah i mean in that order i guess well we don't know yeah we don't know that

01:49:03.760 --> 01:49:11.920
either of them are here but i guess uh should we split up cover more ground yeah let's let's let's

01:49:11.920 --> 01:49:17.840
split up you like it when we split up right yeah there's only one door though okay let's not split

01:49:17.840 --> 01:49:22.960
up until we get through a door that has more than two doors let's stay together through this first

01:49:22.960 --> 01:49:28.560
door good idea i we open that door all right you you go through uh the door and you see a narrow

01:49:28.560 --> 01:49:35.120
hallway that leads into the main space of the uh theater itself like so you can see kind of the

01:49:35.120 --> 01:49:40.880
main audience space and then the main stage which is a pretty huge construction there's catwalks overhead

01:49:40.880 --> 01:49:48.080
and kind of rigs for ropes and curtains and stuff like that to the right there's a door and then to

01:49:48.080 --> 01:49:52.800
the and then past that door there's also another door to the right and then um then there's kind

01:49:52.800 --> 01:49:57.840
of like a backstage area but those are the only kind of rooms there's there's only the only rooms

01:49:57.840 --> 01:50:04.800
you see are like these two rooms the kitchen and then this whole big kind of stage space uh well

01:50:04.800 --> 01:50:13.120
there's two doors i'll take the first door i'll take the second okay i listen at mine first

01:50:13.680 --> 01:50:20.080
you don't hear anything in either okay i open i try to open the first door it's uh it's a bathroom

01:50:20.640 --> 01:50:24.800
it looks like a nice bathroom like it's a performers bathroom i take a giant

01:50:24.800 --> 01:50:33.040
shit it's great you feel well taken care of okay what's behind my door it's like uh it's like a

01:50:33.040 --> 01:50:37.200
green room kind of lounge area there's just kind of sitting and it's kind of centrally

01:50:37.200 --> 01:50:43.840
located to be kind of near the stage and kind of out of the way it's uh pretty empty yeah nothing

01:50:43.840 --> 01:50:49.760
no no no ways out from there no it's just yeah it's just like uh like a dressing room let's

01:50:49.760 --> 01:50:55.360
check backstage all right so i'm done taking a poop and i come out and rejoin carlo so we go backstage

01:50:55.360 --> 01:51:04.000
all right all right you're searching around in the backstage and you find a number of levers

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:09.600
there's five levers they seem to be connected to various ropes and things uh like that like winches

01:51:09.600 --> 01:51:17.200
and pulleys and sandbags sort of things if we're running through here later let's pull all of these

01:51:17.200 --> 01:51:21.680
and maybe some shit will fall on the people chasing us yeah i like that all right uh anywhere

01:51:21.680 --> 01:51:32.880
anywhere to go um no it's just it's like behind a stage you know oh all right so we're just on

01:51:32.880 --> 01:51:43.760
stage let's go back to steve hey hey guys hey hey guys do you like pizza do you like pizza

01:51:43.760 --> 01:51:54.160
pizza doesn't exist uh what are you talking about i actually don't know this is a good question

01:51:54.960 --> 01:51:59.680
do you like the word pizza i just made it up yeah it sounds great cool me too bros for life

01:51:59.680 --> 01:52:09.600
bros for life hell yeah i like you guys we hate you why it seems unfounded i didn't do anything wrong

01:52:09.600 --> 01:52:19.600
yeah no you guys killed you you guys are like attacking our people who's you guys these strangers

01:52:19.600 --> 01:52:25.280
are coming into our town we saw you with them yeah because i'm like they're slave you saved me

01:52:26.880 --> 01:52:35.200
that's a new development you didn't lead with that what you knew why you were captured

01:52:35.200 --> 01:52:42.480
we i i mean you got to do what you're told to do when you're a slave but Steve while you're

01:52:42.480 --> 01:52:47.200
talking you can hear footsteps above your head unlike the wooden boards

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:54.480
i just start making fart noises really loud with my hands oh wait i can't do it with my hands so

01:52:54.480 --> 01:53:01.120
what i can do with my my mouth so i'm just going like i'm just like that's the sound like i know

01:53:01.120 --> 01:53:11.520
that they'll understand what's happening you know like all right carlos you hear a farting sound

01:53:11.520 --> 01:53:16.320
did you hear that fart sound followed by the sound of guards beating someone out it's hard not to

01:53:16.320 --> 01:53:22.560
abuse this inside information uh i heard a fart yeah i mean that's the sound that he always makes

01:53:22.560 --> 01:53:32.160
when he's in trouble sounds like he's below us yeah all right i i look for a way to get down

01:53:32.160 --> 01:53:39.360
like below the stage um the stage is kind of sealed off but uh wait let's do a search if he's

01:53:39.360 --> 01:53:44.000
making those fart sounds either he just makes them constantly or he could hear that means that

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:49.360
means that that's his way of communicating does that mean he could hear us up here he heard footsteps

01:53:49.360 --> 01:53:57.040
above well i think then so did the bad guys well the bad guys are working steve over for making

01:53:57.040 --> 01:54:05.280
farting sounds um but yeah it's the jeff you spy you spy the the thinnest faintest outline of a

01:54:05.280 --> 01:54:12.080
rectangle a trap door in the stage i open that rectangle trap door you can't it's like you can't

01:54:12.080 --> 01:54:19.440
you can't sneak your little fingers in there it's so such a tight thing and levers i i i examine the

01:54:19.440 --> 01:54:25.360
lever mechanisms and see if like i assume like you know i i'm no stranger to the theater uh as a

01:54:25.360 --> 01:54:31.920
as a man of the cloth uh you know it's all performance um so i'm looking at pulleys and

01:54:31.920 --> 01:54:36.560
ropes and going like well is there anything that i can rule out as something that would

01:54:36.560 --> 01:54:42.400
potentially open the trap door um there's one that seems like it's definitely not the trap

01:54:42.400 --> 01:54:50.080
door i found it's in the middle i got down to four okay i guess i just start pulling them all

01:54:50.080 --> 01:54:56.800
all right uh walk me through the methodology you start with one and then wait or something

01:54:56.800 --> 01:55:02.960
uh yeah because you know there's like cockpits smashing all the buttons simultaneously it's

01:55:02.960 --> 01:55:10.800
i'm one at a time i'm i'm no i'm just i'm going i'm going like this here's what i'm doing

01:55:11.680 --> 01:55:19.920
crank crank crank crank like i'm not really waiting to see what happens okay um yeah you pull them all

01:55:20.480 --> 01:55:25.440
a couple sandbags drop out of the out of like the rafters and stuff and smash into the ground

01:55:25.440 --> 01:55:30.720
and just kind of spill sand over and then uh the the trap door starts lowering in the stage

01:55:30.720 --> 01:55:40.720
sweet oh starts lowering like yeah it's like retracting into the below grounds like it's like a

01:55:40.720 --> 01:55:45.840
is it a hinge or what is it no it's like a lift oh okay so it's going down like a dumb waiter

01:55:45.840 --> 01:55:54.400
like a power platform oh okay i i i get on that lowering platform uh you do that you're on it

01:55:54.400 --> 01:56:01.440
it's lowering what about you dan can i fit on there with oh yeah chad i could like hold a horse or

01:56:01.440 --> 01:56:07.520
all right well let's fucking do a horse eat low sources all right so we're lowering down on the

01:56:07.520 --> 01:56:14.160
thing yeah um yeah you go into the thing you see uh it's kind of like a waiting room um

01:56:14.160 --> 01:56:18.400
kind of area it's completely empty there's no one in it it seems like there's a place where you could

01:56:18.400 --> 01:56:23.200
put your weapons and other equipment and some coat racks and stuff it's just kind of like a

01:56:23.200 --> 01:56:29.200
waiting area for you to hang out for you to stage goods in the platform area for the trap door and

01:56:29.200 --> 01:56:40.320
stuff there's a door hmm all right listen at the door yeah all right what do you what do you want

01:56:40.320 --> 01:56:51.360
to do how do you want to do this um i uh i'm looking for my spells real quick not that i think this

01:56:51.360 --> 01:56:59.520
is gonna be an issue but we should probably try to take one of them alive i'm not i'm not i'm not

01:57:00.400 --> 01:57:06.640
assuming we're gonna be able to kill them all dan you realize that your health is really low

01:57:06.640 --> 01:57:13.120
wait but i thought oh yeah i guess uh shit what do you think well i thought yeah i guess i lost

01:57:13.120 --> 01:57:24.240
track i thought that i uh i i give him some good berries do you have any well i can heal myself right

01:57:24.240 --> 01:57:34.560
yeah um how do i do that am i am i am i giving up a uh spell so if you find what spell loadout you

01:57:34.560 --> 01:57:41.040
have you can turn any level one or two spell into a heal spell i'm gonna conveniently assume i was

01:57:41.040 --> 01:57:47.360
doing loadout three offense i think you were so i will uh yeah i will sacrifice my inflict

01:57:47.360 --> 01:57:58.320
moderate wounds touch um in order to heal myself how much damage does that do um 2d 8 plus one

01:57:58.320 --> 01:58:04.720
okay does that matter or the healing is the same basically so but what if i had said someone monster

01:58:04.720 --> 01:58:11.200
two well it's just specifically inflicted healer the same spell but opposite so so i couldn't i

01:58:11.200 --> 01:58:16.400
wouldn't have been able to sacrifice someone monster two to do a heal spell no you could

01:58:17.760 --> 01:58:22.800
and it would be the same then why did you ask oh you just asked us a shortcut because so you

01:58:22.800 --> 01:58:34.400
didn't have to look it up right okay you gain back 12 health all right so uh what what's burning

01:58:34.400 --> 01:58:39.440
hands by the way i can't i can't find the descriptor it's an aoe spell it deals your level three i think

01:58:39.440 --> 01:58:45.200
it should deal 3d 4 damage in a big arc that's if i just touch people or it it shoots it out like a

01:58:45.200 --> 01:58:51.600
flamethrower aoe is age of empires all right so area of the fact we're it's it's after 10 o'clock

01:58:51.600 --> 01:58:57.600
so we we're at the door right now you're healed up we're ready to go in there and find diarrhea

01:58:57.600 --> 01:59:07.920
junior right mm-hmm so uh carlos that's diarrhea

01:59:10.880 --> 01:59:16.720
um when you're running into first and you feel something burst

01:59:16.720 --> 01:59:25.520
it's diarrhea when you're sliding in the second and your bowels begin to beckon

01:59:27.600 --> 01:59:32.080
that's diarrhea i try to very quietly open the door okay

01:59:34.720 --> 01:59:38.960
sorry i'm rolling dice on my phone that's what's happening when you're sliding in the third

01:59:38.960 --> 01:59:50.160
and you think you later turd that's diarrhea you creak open the door with with a slight noise but

01:59:50.880 --> 01:59:56.960
it seems to be being masked by the noise of farting what do we see you see

01:59:58.960 --> 02:00:05.200
one of the guys is punching diarrhea who's like on his side um being tied up he's got a big black

02:00:05.200 --> 02:00:10.240
eye you see patches who sprawled out tied up on the opposite wall and you see two guys that are

02:00:10.240 --> 02:00:16.800
watching um the one guy beat up passions they're kind of you're you would be within eye shot but

02:00:16.800 --> 02:00:20.800
you're not noticed yet so it's like they're not looking right at you but they're kind of like

02:00:20.800 --> 02:00:25.440
in you're in their field of vision if they were paying attention i turned to carlos and i said carlos

02:00:25.440 --> 02:00:40.000
it's time to uh head for home and when you feel something foam that's diarrhea cliffhanger

02:00:45.440 --> 02:00:48.640
