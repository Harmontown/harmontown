too far\n\n03:40.000 --> 03:47.680\nfar in which direction uh i thought i thought i thought i thought it was a little risque\n\n03:47.680 --> 03:56.320\nbut you know what you go selma you go selma uh what did you think of selma high x uh attire\n\n03:56.320 --> 04:03.040\ni thought it was tasteful oh okay was it yes okay well bad guess on my part then\n\n04:03.040 --> 04:09.120\nyou but who is it was maya rudoff at church who is the gal the chick that was with uh maya rudoff\n\n04:10.160 --> 04:15.920\ntiffany had it fucking hilarious they should host all the oscar's from now on they were\n\n04:15.920 --> 04:21.920\nfucking hilarious yeah they came out with their heels off and they held them like fuck this shit\n\n04:21.920 --> 04:29.040\nand and and they were maya rudoff was wearing like a sleigh like a giant red snuggie and she\n\n04:29.040 --> 04:34.000\nlooked great i'm not i'm not talking shit she looked fantastic but she did not play ball\n\n04:34.000 --> 04:40.320\nlike in the oscar fashion she did her own shit and they were way funnier than everybody else\n\n04:40.320 --> 04:44.240\nand like no offense to jimmy kimmel who's doing a good job as far as because we only\n\n04:44.240 --> 04:51.680\nwatched probably what the third of it church the fourth uh he was doing a good job but maya rudoff\n\n04:51.680 --> 04:59.440\nand haddish that's what he said how do you say her name tiffany had it tiffany haddish\n\n05:00.080 --> 05:06.240\nfucking hilarious well i'll have to check it out i was a little disappointed i got to be honest with\n\n05:06.240 --> 05:16.240\nyou that uh what's her name from church i'm blanking you have to give more more of a clue\n\n05:16.240 --> 05:26.160\nthe the mom from uh leddie bird why can't i remember her name ever lori metcalf who's one\n\n05:26.160 --> 05:30.960\nof my favorites her name is always like a fucking blank for me lori metcalf that was so good and\n\n05:30.960 --> 05:35.600\nshe did not win best supporting actress although i thought she might have so the results are still\n\n05:35.600 --> 05:40.320\ncoming in i take it oh yeah the best picture hasn't been announced but but get out what do you think\n\n05:40.320 --> 05:45.040\nthen predict it right now make your call because it hasn't that'll be the last thing it'll probably\n\n05:45.040 --> 05:50.880\nhappen an hour from now like my gut says get out i mean i but i don't really know how the oscar\n\n05:50.880 --> 05:59.200\nvoting works i mean i know that it's like you know it's it's a lot of actors of a lot of\n\n05:59.200 --> 06:04.000\nages so it's all about yardage sometimes you sometimes you make the prediction based on well\n\n06:04.000 --> 06:11.280\nit's a liberal political like easy darling like like it's it's hollywood it's good but but then\n\n06:11.280 --> 06:17.120\nevery bit you know look let's face it like something like get out you could find the line\n\n06:17.120 --> 06:23.840\nwithin liberal hollywood elite like they're the baby boomers that probably dominate the academy\n\n06:25.120 --> 06:30.960\nprobably might have watched get out and been like i don't see i don't like that i would have\n\n06:30.960 --> 06:43.520\nthought that shape of water was going to win but church what were you saying that there is a beef about\n\n06:43.520 --> 06:46.480\ncome on stage church like if you're going to talk grab a mic\n\n06:50.000 --> 06:54.160\nhe asked you a question and then halfway through your answer yeah well if you're going to come on\n\n06:54.160 --> 06:58.240\nstage if you're going to talk well she she if you're not going to ignore me she had to turn\n\n06:58.240 --> 07:03.600\noff the live stream to be on the show right like that live stream is that's money out of our pocket\n\n07:03.600 --> 07:10.400\nanyway yeah what's up with that live stream church you you're you're you're telling people to not\n\n07:10.400 --> 07:18.240\nsubscribe to our shit teasing all right stream subscription it's church with the oscar data\n\n07:19.360 --> 07:23.760\nwhat's up with what's up with shape of water what's what's the beef there was so what i was\n\n07:23.760 --> 07:32.320\nhorror was there a couple days ago was that they're being sued for plagiarism there's a lawsuit\n\n07:32.320 --> 07:40.560\nthat brought got brought up by the inheritors of the rights to a play like the kids of this guy\n\n07:40.560 --> 07:50.720\nthis playwright about them lifting it seems like most of the story from this play so it's a it's a\n\n07:50.720 --> 07:58.960\nfish man there's a girl who works as a maid in the in like the the lab where they're keeping this\n\n07:58.960 --> 08:06.000\nfish man in the play there's even a scene where the cat's head gets lopped off in this play so\n\n08:06.640 --> 08:11.360\nthere's and those are just the examples that were given in this article about it and their kind of\n\n08:11.360 --> 08:17.600\naccusation was well isn't this lawsuit timely right when the Oscars are happening and their response\n\n08:17.600 --> 08:26.320\nback was that's ludicrous you know we have a case and it's coming up because your film came out\n\n08:26.320 --> 08:31.200\nand oh the insinuation was that there was some kind of like weird they were trying to like time it\n\n08:31.200 --> 08:36.800\nto get the money or whatever by trying to hold the the film hostage like it might jeopardize\n\n08:36.800 --> 08:44.240\nwhether or not it could win things like best screenplay for example doesn't have that oscar\n\n08:44.240 --> 08:52.640\nflavor to me shape of water anyway you know right what what does for you well get out i guess yeah\n\n08:52.640 --> 08:58.400\nbut i i mean i know it's very simple and it's i want that to win but well i honestly florida\n\n08:58.400 --> 09:04.320\nproject it didn't get it didn't get nominated for anything except defo and then like i what else was\n\n09:04.320 --> 09:10.880\nthere it's just like it's post the post is it we know my feelings about that and uh three billboards\n\n09:10.880 --> 09:17.760\nuh like like uh my bounds so i i didn't see ladybird i didn't see i don't know what the nominees\n\n09:17.760 --> 09:23.520\nfor best picture are but but but i didn't i love ladybird i love ladybird the only thing i saw that\n\n09:23.520 --> 09:28.480\nseems like a shoe in is is is get out but shoe in is like with giant air quotes because it's not\n\n09:28.480 --> 09:34.240\nwe're not talking about a popularity contest we're also not talking about like a craftsmanship like\n\n09:34.240 --> 09:40.560\nit's a bummer that our friends uh emily and george uh and kumail did not win for a screenplay but\n\n09:40.560 --> 09:48.000\nit's awesome that jordan peel won for get out that's that's amazing yeah i mean obviously yeah it's\n\n09:48.000 --> 09:54.240\nmore of a tragedy for us because kumail and emily are family so we'd rather they win but uh yeah if\n\n09:54.240 --> 10:02.160\nyou're at least they didn't lose to something that we also hated and like kumail just tweeted\n\n10:02.160 --> 10:10.240\nthey came in second place uh i mean i have to honestly it's like it is an honor to be nominated\n\n10:10.240 --> 10:14.880\nit is enough i mean i'm sure it's a bummer to not win yeah it's not just something that people say\n\n10:14.880 --> 10:20.480\nyou get to wear that that title for the rest of your life your oscar nominated so and so forever\n\n10:20.480 --> 10:26.800\nor actually i just realized you won an emmy for writing about the oscars yeah and uh monster house\n\n10:26.800 --> 10:32.800\nwas nominated for an oscar but and that wasn't an honor so maybe kumail and emily i really bummed\n\n10:32.800 --> 10:37.840\nout tonight hell yeah but i don't think it's a different thing because it's not i always forget\n\n10:37.840 --> 10:42.720\nmonster house was nominated for oscar because really it's like you you make an animated film over a\n\n10:42.720 --> 10:48.400\ncertain budget you and you know like it it didn't feel like it didn't feel like monster house was\n\n10:48.400 --> 10:58.400\na citizen cane of also there was like a page one rewrite on that like wasn't there uh didn't they monster house but did monster house get rewritten by somebody like a\n\n10:58.400 --> 11:04.480\nhanded off to another writer or no oh well yeah it wasn't like it but it wasn't nominated for best\n\n11:04.480 --> 11:10.080\nscreenplay anyway it was but nominated for like best animated feature or something i think uh either emily or\n\n11:10.080 --> 11:16.480\nkumail tweeted like i would happily lose uh an oscar to jordan peel for the rest of my life\n\n11:16.480 --> 11:24.480\nlike yeah and i think that he means that or she means that yeah it was a good it's a good year to get nominated in that category\n\n11:24.480 --> 11:30.320\nand and not win because you can you can save for the rest of your life the competition was incredibly\n\n11:30.320 --> 11:37.840\nstiff the the best original screenplay category i've always said is is curiously uh seems immune\n\n11:37.840 --> 11:44.480\nfrom any kind of like corruption or or value drift that you could accuse the oscars of ever having\n\n11:44.480 --> 11:50.320\nlike i've always felt like the original screenplay uh nominees and winners are pretty\n\n11:51.440 --> 11:57.760\nlike i've i've never i don't remember ever going what you know like it's it's it's it's it seems like\n\n11:57.760 --> 12:03.680\npeople have a head on their shoulders about it or maybe it's just like an easy thing to to go ah that\n\n12:03.680 --> 12:10.160\nmovie was very written i don't know i i like that Dunkirk won like the moment we stopped watching it\n\n12:10.160 --> 12:19.440\nthey'd already won three oscars uh for sound design sound editing and editing um and like oh yeah like\n\n12:19.440 --> 12:25.840\nthat's like like star wars and baby driver didn't win those things like normally like it's like a\n\n12:25.840 --> 12:31.440\ntransformers that win sound design that makes a bunch of noise or some horrible shit like i like that\n\n12:31.440 --> 12:37.440\nthey left it to like a movie that just told one very simple story i'm only gonna say it one more\n\n12:37.440 --> 12:42.960\ntime now that the oscars are over if you're a director and there's more than three kids in\n\n12:42.960 --> 12:48.560\nyour movie that are on screen for more than a half hour uh you should automatically be nominated\n\n12:48.560 --> 12:54.880\nas a director that's why i feel the florida project was snubbed i and then you count willem\n\n12:54.880 --> 13:04.960\ndefoe in there who is a very talented actor but as we've seen from his oof um he doesn't come to set\n\n13:04.960 --> 13:13.680\nthat ready to ground it you know like he like nicholas cage he's perfectly capable in the\n\n13:13.680 --> 13:23.200\nright hands of of of being a strat of areas but he will just show up as garage band um if if left\n\n13:23.200 --> 13:29.520\nunchecked and here's my fear because like well somebody like like on the on the crew here like\n\n13:29.520 --> 13:37.040\nkeep us posted who wins best actor because i don't want it to be gary oldman for his impression\n\n13:37.040 --> 13:43.200\nof church hall i don't want that to happen what put a pin in that we'll get back to that i what\n\n13:43.200 --> 13:50.960\nwhat was the what was itanya up for did it did the director of itanya get nominated i don't know\n\n13:50.960 --> 13:56.800\nbut that was the winner of best supporting actress was the mom and uh and she was great\n\n13:56.800 --> 14:03.600\nshe was fantastic uh but but uh yeah i mean i those are the two directors to me florida project\n\n14:03.600 --> 14:10.240\nperson and itanya person don't can't remember either their names i but i would if i was a\n\n14:11.360 --> 14:22.160\na a betting person like betting on length and uh a contribution of careers to come like i would\n\n14:22.160 --> 14:28.800\nput a lot of money on those two i think those movies were outstanding demonstrations of\n\n14:29.600 --> 14:34.640\nspecifically direction i think that i think that directors get ripped off a lot of the Oscars\n\n14:34.640 --> 14:41.600\nbecause it's hard to i i think that i i'm gonna probably get a bunch of tomatoes thrown at me\n\n14:41.600 --> 14:48.240\nby a lot of like i don't know this is a provocative thing to say but i think actors control the academy\n\n14:48.240 --> 14:53.760\nand actors don't you know to to them directors are like these assholes that tell you what to do\n\n14:55.200 --> 15:00.160\nbut to be fair when the director fails no one will ever know that they'll just see shitty\n\n15:00.160 --> 15:03.840\nperformer there's performances out of the actors too so they kind of take the fall\n\n15:04.480 --> 15:09.520\nwhen as much as getting all the kind of glory and attention and and having all the focus put\n\n15:09.520 --> 15:15.680\non the acting yeah this is definitely like an actors event i just feel like not to be pedantic\n\n15:15.680 --> 15:20.240\nabout it but if you ask a writer who's a good director the writer's gonna have an answer that\n\n15:20.240 --> 15:26.800\nhas something to do with like you know how they affected that person's script and also that writer\n\n15:26.800 --> 15:31.680\nis gonna they're gonna be far from the trenches and able to observe it kind of rationally um\n\n15:32.240 --> 15:36.960\nthe if you ask other directors directors are gonna go of course i well my god i couldn't\n\n15:36.960 --> 15:41.760\nhave gotten that performance out of that cat or you know that that that was beautiful that that\n\n15:41.760 --> 15:46.880\nthat shot and this was i i know what goes into directing at blah blah blah but if you ask an actor\n\n15:46.880 --> 15:54.480\ni feel like they're so close to it uh that that that i feel like i hate to offend my actor friends\n\n15:54.480 --> 16:01.280\nbut i i feel like an actor in general as like a biomass like an actor would go oh who's who's the\n\n16:01.280 --> 16:07.360\nbest director uh oh yeah that one person that uh uh they did very few takes and they let me go home\n\n16:07.360 --> 16:14.400\non time yeah but i think i love that guy my understanding of how like at least the nominations\n\n16:14.400 --> 16:21.040\nprocess works is that it's like the previous winners from your category so it's like the\n\n16:21.040 --> 16:24.880\nother directors who've won best director or it's like the other oh is it doesn't really work out\n\n16:24.880 --> 16:30.080\nso they yeah so their job is to like watch all the the things that are nominated they want to\n\n16:30.080 --> 16:35.520\nconsider for that category and then they decide who's not me so like my friend it was my friend\n\n16:35.520 --> 16:38.640\nmichael dana who explained this to me because he was like oh i gotta watch all these movies and\n\n16:38.640 --> 16:47.200\ndecide who to nominate for a best um score best original score because now that he had won for\n\n16:47.200 --> 16:53.760\nlife of pie he was now on that panel to make those decisions so your job is to listen to everything\n\n16:53.760 --> 16:57.680\nand decide okay these are worthy of nomination these are not so then you narrow it down and then\n\n16:57.680 --> 17:02.080\neverybody votes oh but then but then is my understanding everybody votes it's it's a it's\n\n17:02.080 --> 17:06.320\nso yeah because then everybody throws their hat and it goes okay so from so from the nominations\n\n17:06.320 --> 17:12.000\nfrom the people who are the peers in those groups now everybody gets to weigh in i kind of wish\n\n17:12.000 --> 17:20.560\ni wish they carry through the jury of peers in your craft all the way to the finish line because\n\n17:20.560 --> 17:25.360\nthat way you wouldn't have this the potential value drift i mean it would be only to the extent that\n\n17:25.360 --> 17:32.560\nthe definition of good directing ever changed you know then that would change like i it really it\n\n17:32.560 --> 17:37.200\nreally seems like that would be and then imagine the honor that that would be too you'd be like holy\n\n17:37.200 --> 17:42.560\nshit like scorsese but maybe that's why it's such an honor to be nominated though well yeah exactly\n\n17:42.560 --> 17:46.480\nbecause the nomination is the thing that you're actually getting from other people who you've\n\n17:46.480 --> 17:51.920\nlooked up to for so many years and aspired to be like not the win and if you get an asker it could\n\n17:51.920 --> 17:57.760\njust be marisa tomei got drunk and she's like just kidding i love her uh it's just like so scared\n\n17:57.760 --> 18:02.880\nmarisa tomei's watching i say we go around the room right now and see who can do the best bad\n\n18:02.880 --> 18:10.400\nChurchill because he just wants to do his Churchill let's start with jeff all right i'll start go ahead\n\n18:10.400 --> 18:16.160\njeff no we are dan you want to start no we're starting with jeff all right we shall never\n\n18:16.160 --> 18:23.360\nyou end up that's me doing gary oldman's Churchill okay then you're i mean i don't\n\n18:25.680 --> 18:30.080\nthere's i'm coming out in a state of nature\n\n18:32.880 --> 18:42.400\nthat's good transfer um you're a bitch all right he was like a womanizer right or like a woman\n\n18:42.400 --> 18:49.200\nbeater yeah something like that yeah i that wasn't the movie yeah i'm gonna have to look\n\n18:49.200 --> 18:53.840\nbecause you want to look that up your name is partially partially Churchill so why don't you\n\n18:53.840 --> 18:59.040\nbring it home yeah you should be the best of this these are fight them on the beaches\n\n19:00.240 --> 19:09.040\nhell yeah blow on we will not say that the greeks fight like heroes but not the heroes fight like\n\n19:09.040 --> 19:16.400\ngreeks that's a direct quote jeff what is so was mine what is your beef i understand the movie\n\n19:16.400 --> 19:22.000\nwasn't we shall never you end up do you really think that was a that gary oldman's doing a bad\n\n19:22.000 --> 19:28.480\njob in that role i just i think you i'm not i look i'm not a big gary oldman fan i think he's\n\n19:28.480 --> 19:33.760\none of our bias he's a great overactor i just thought that movie here's the deal the movie\n\n19:33.760 --> 19:38.720\nsucked didn't go anywhere it was a movie about making one speech and they they ramp it up and he\n\n19:38.720 --> 19:43.600\nmakes one speech and then the movie's over kind of interest i agree with you not a not a not an\n\n19:43.600 --> 19:48.880\nexciting movie uh and i'm not saying this is a mitigating factor but it is interesting\n\n19:49.680 --> 19:54.720\nwhen i watch them like wow so this is the guy that's famous for all those quotes like if you\n\n19:54.720 --> 20:01.520\nswing a cat at a quote yeah like it's a Churchill quote and uh and the movie's just about how that's\n\n20:01.520 --> 20:07.520\nall he ever did he just ran his mouth uh but but he he i mean he changed history running his mouth\n\n20:07.520 --> 20:12.000\nbut it doesn't make for a particularly interesting biopic the end of the movie i was surprised at\n\n20:12.000 --> 20:16.560\nthe end of the movie when i go what what just happened the guy goes he mobilized the English\n\n20:16.560 --> 20:25.680\nlanguage and took it into battle which is a great line but that's act one like page one like it's\n\n20:25.680 --> 20:31.680\nlike but now he was a loudmouth because he was half american and his mother was an american and\n\n20:31.680 --> 20:37.280\nthey kind of got this sort of that kind of like bold outspoken like that's probably a movie so many\n\n20:37.280 --> 20:44.720\npeople or did not like Churchill he ended up being a huge hero especially to americans i need to be\n\n20:44.720 --> 20:52.480\ncorny erin sorkinny guy but i think if if i if i were had a gun turned on me like you gotta write\n\n20:52.480 --> 20:58.000\nthe Churchill biopic i having found out through research what that movie reveals which is that\n\n20:58.000 --> 21:04.480\nthere's not a huge arc for this guy etc and he didn't do a lot but but was very important just\n\n21:06.160 --> 21:12.480\ni would i would then go my my sorkin gland would then go okay well let's talk about his wife and\n\n21:12.480 --> 21:17.360\nlet's you know that relationship because i thought that you know those scenes were touching and you\n\n21:17.360 --> 21:22.880\ncould tell those were based on either internal notes or studio notes through like this thing needs\n\n21:22.880 --> 21:28.160\nsomething and so they had those one or two scenes with the wife where you're getting to know Churchill\n\n21:28.160 --> 21:36.160\nthe the aging lover Churchill the uh the the the the baby that needs his diaper changed but acknowledges\n\n21:36.160 --> 21:44.560\nhis his his wife is his mommy and uh uh Churchill's wife the dutiful you know uh the the woman has no\n\n21:44.560 --> 21:53.360\nname kind of like a selfless politicians wife kind of thing i if i would dig like sorkin deep\n\n21:53.360 --> 21:58.640\nfor anything there and just figure out a three-act structure like have them have a fight on page 70\n\n21:58.640 --> 22:08.480\nand then have them kiss her on page 95 because that world war two story turns out it's pretty\n\n22:08.480 --> 22:15.200\nlinear those nazis just kept coming and then uh you know who was a great Churchill was lithgow\n\n22:16.160 --> 22:21.280\nhis his Churchill i thought was really do you why don't you do john john lithgow\n\n22:21.280 --> 22:28.560\ndo your john lithgow as Winston Churchill is the only thing we have to fear is that\n\n22:28.560 --> 22:36.560\nit's not a circle it's the only one he didn't say well the the the fear one of the stick one\n\n22:36.560 --> 22:42.400\nthose are roosevelt i think that was fdr fdr is fear fdr is fear roosevelt's stick everything\n\n22:42.400 --> 22:53.520\nelse is Churchill yeah it is it's in it is in these times of circular mouths that one man's\n\n22:53.520 --> 23:04.960\nharry must come to his Henderson's where did Churchill say that i believe in this realm\n\n23:07.600 --> 23:13.760\ni believe in this island i thought you were giving me music i was trying to i was trying to give you\n\n23:13.760 --> 23:21.280\nthe uh Jurassic Park theme jeff's ipad isn't working tonight when i look out at those lighthouses\n\n23:21.280 --> 23:31.360\nand spotted dicks that make up the coastline of this historically impenetrable isle\n\n23:33.040 --> 23:38.000\ni ask myself what will the man be who gives it up\n\n23:38.000 --> 23:50.480\nand the answer is a pariah he will be forever unforgiven and so i say you the house of lords\n\n23:51.280 --> 23:59.760\nand the commoners and the third parliament of groundlings we must come together in the opposition\n\n23:59.760 --> 24:07.200\nfor the great creme de la creme the pièce de résistance\n\n24:09.680 --> 24:18.240\nthe cockney wainscotting this country has never surrendered we were at stonehenge\n\n24:18.240 --> 24:28.480\nwe were at baskerville we kept the hounds at bay jack the ripper recoiled from our touch\n\n24:30.480 --> 24:38.400\npudding was invented here where the place ben franklin loved to come on the weekends\n\n24:38.400 --> 24:50.240\nthat may have been france but we're 90 miles from there i'm john lift now say to you\n\n24:52.240 --> 24:58.960\nthree five four what's in the blood of an englishman\n\n24:58.960 --> 25:08.320\nbravery victory bitch sticks and no fear\n\n25:11.760 --> 25:12.560\ndinosaurs\n\n25:16.160 --> 25:20.560\nwhat did he do he weaponized the english language\n\n25:20.560 --> 25:30.640\nso your version of winston churchill thought he was john lithgow\n\n25:32.160 --> 25:40.320\nhe became he found out who he was yeah he's true to himself that's what gary oldman brought to the\n\n25:40.320 --> 25:50.640\nperformance i think uh what was i gonna say what is it nazis nazis work oh the the it's it's funny\n\n25:50.640 --> 25:54.640\nhow the you know the most devastating scene in that movie is the phone call when he calls\n\n25:55.360 --> 26:02.880\ncalls roosevelt and he's like i have some airplanes and tanks and and it's just like that\n\n26:03.440 --> 26:09.520\nit's like any phone call from any decade within any relationship it's just like it's just\n\n26:09.520 --> 26:16.080\nheartbreaking like like someone just blowing someone off but it's like winston i i would give you\n\n26:16.080 --> 26:25.280\nanything but i i have to go take a poop now i i'll be back yeah i must have been how come the\n\n26:25.280 --> 26:30.160\nbritish don't hate us a little bit more because they lost their empire like we're about to\n\n26:30.960 --> 26:36.480\nlike they lost their swag yeah but i mean doesn't that isn't that when you get angrier\n\n26:36.480 --> 26:42.320\nbut they didn't have the army or the armada to to back that up but they can be as angry as they\n\n26:42.320 --> 26:46.960\nlike no but i'm saying how come how come the story how come how come everybody just goes along\n\n26:46.960 --> 26:53.520\nwith the story of us being uh swell and dandy in our handling of world war two because we did end\n\n26:53.520 --> 27:00.880\nup saving anybody's asses like when we finally did step in it it saved the day it's i mean isn't\n\n27:00.880 --> 27:07.600\nthat something that an asshole does in a in a situation where they could observe that uh it's\n\n27:07.600 --> 27:12.160\nlike well if i just wait a little longer you know i'll be a real hero here that's what we did we\n\n27:12.160 --> 27:17.920\nwaited too long twice we could have saved them early in both world wars we were like gandalf with\n\n27:17.920 --> 27:23.600\nthe eagles oh shit it's like well what the fuck yeah oh yeah yeah you had these eagles the whole\n\n27:23.600 --> 27:29.840\ngod damn time because roosevelt was trying to dig the country out of a depression and the country\n\n27:29.840 --> 27:35.040\ndidn't want another foreign war after world war one and it was a really unpopular idea so he was\n\n27:35.040 --> 27:40.560\nholding off holding off holding off holding off doing this and i guess they do and i guess we\n\n27:40.560 --> 27:46.160\nwish i had a historian or somebody appears i don't risk offending anybody but i that i i i recall\n\n27:47.040 --> 27:55.440\nthat it's something that we like like we didn't the uh revelation of how much holocausting was\n\n27:55.440 --> 27:59.760\nhappening was kind of like at the end like they figured that out when we got there there were\n\n27:59.760 --> 28:05.520\nrumors right because people had fled and so when you leave out that like kind of like very epic\n\n28:05.520 --> 28:10.640\nlike uh genocide thing which is how we're all taught about world war two but when you just\n\n28:10.640 --> 28:16.640\nlook at it minus that well it's just a giant war over in europe and they've already done one of those\n\n28:16.640 --> 28:20.880\nand so okay we're here on the other side of the atlantic which was a way bigger deal before the\n\n28:20.880 --> 28:26.240\ninternet and uh so yeah okay i guess they just thought like they'll they'll work it out maybe\n\n28:26.240 --> 28:34.080\nhitler will be a great european chancellor and we'll we'll sell him steel and people loved him at first\n\n28:34.880 --> 28:41.040\nyeah he he did it he did it good they were doing a great job of repairing germany in the first few\n\n28:41.040 --> 28:48.720\nyears it's when they started conquering everything and everyone around them that europe went uh maybe\n\n28:48.720 --> 28:56.160\nwe need to call for backup oh hitler oh hitler we hardly knew ye\n\n29:01.920 --> 29:07.760\ni think our problem is we never really got to know hitler right we were we didn't give him a chance\n\n29:09.200 --> 29:14.880\nwell i was surprised if i watched a conspiracy uh thing on netflix and i was i was kind of uh\n\n29:14.880 --> 29:24.320\nsurprised at how um how likely it is that uh uh hitler faked his death\n\n29:25.680 --> 29:30.160\nlike is that hunting hitler was you really watching hunting hitler it was just there was never i mean\n\n29:30.160 --> 29:36.320\nif you even if you go with the straight narrative with no conspiracy theories at all like the actual\n\n29:36.320 --> 29:41.280\nmainstream like this is what's supposed to have happened he shot himself from the head and\n\n29:41.280 --> 29:48.880\nand eve brown took cyanide and then the germans doused his body with gasoline and set it on fire\n\n29:48.880 --> 29:53.440\nin a shallow pit yeah and then covered that up with dirt and didn't tell anybody where it was\n\n29:53.440 --> 29:57.680\nbecause miscellany had just been strung up in the streets and he'd heard about it and didn't want\n\n29:57.680 --> 30:02.800\nhis body to be mutilated his body guard took him out and said like like not only should he be dead\n\n30:02.800 --> 30:07.840\nand not be able to like be tortured he should be like mutilated and and like like like just burned\n\n30:07.840 --> 30:14.480\nto a cinder they shouldn't have the body to be able to um hang up on you know they took him out\n\n30:14.480 --> 30:20.240\nin the parking lot burned him up and buried him in a shallow pit now spoil sport to the very end\n\n30:20.240 --> 30:28.320\nnow now let me let me let me run this by you my little my little historians uh in a world where\n\n30:28.320 --> 30:36.000\nwe're in hitler's shoes there in the bunker like okay so he's he's that worried about his corpse\n\n30:36.000 --> 30:44.560\nbeing defiled that he's gonna say to somebody hey Todd come here i'm gonna uh uh after i do\n\n30:45.440 --> 30:52.640\nyou'll hear a pop uh my wife will have white foam coming out of her mouth um don't try to\n\n30:52.640 --> 30:59.840\nresuscitate her you might die um he shot her and then himself do me do me a favor uh yeah\n\n30:59.840 --> 31:08.560\nthis is like don't don't derail do me a favor i got i i'm planning ahead here i'm at i'm at\n\n31:08.560 --> 31:15.200\ni'm at the point where i'm gonna blow my brains out but i'm thinking this much ahead like about\n\n31:15.200 --> 31:23.040\nwhat's gonna happen to my body so i submit to you if he's thinking that much ahead you know it's only\n\n31:23.040 --> 31:29.520\na little bit further ahead to go hey Todd who's that guy what was his name at the Christmas party\n\n31:29.520 --> 31:34.080\neverybody's joking he put the electrical tape on his lip and everybody's like he looks just like me\n\n31:34.080 --> 31:44.320\nyeah oh gary yeah and accounting yeah do me a favor uh put a mustache on him and bring him down here\n\n31:44.320 --> 31:55.920\nand uh and synthia from uh from uh hr um and uh you know bring him down and uh dress him like us\n\n31:55.920 --> 32:02.240\nand uh this is the conspiracy theory is that they did a little switcheroo and uh and hitler went\n\n32:02.240 --> 32:06.240\nout the back door which he very well but it's not like he was trapped in his bunker it was totally\n\n32:06.240 --> 32:12.880\npossible i mean it it it it it it seems like a thing that a spoil sport would do before he was\n\n32:12.880 --> 32:19.840\nlike i won't let you string my corpse up well especially for the nazis who built secret tunnels\n\n32:19.840 --> 32:24.800\neverywhere and always had all kinds of exit plans and made like alliances in spain so that\n\n32:24.800 --> 32:31.040\nthey could go through different countries and and and there were loads of nazis who did escape to\n\n32:31.040 --> 32:37.280\nlike argentina manila and uh like like all these guys eichmann like they they they all made it out\n\n32:37.280 --> 32:43.680\nlike yeah if i'm at war with your country and during the handful of years we were at war\n\n32:43.680 --> 32:52.320\ni'm finding out that you were uh uh diverting revenue to such causes as trying to sew a german\n\n32:52.320 --> 32:58.080\nshepherd's head onto a human body or finding out if uh the devil's real and maybe we could\n\n32:58.080 --> 33:06.560\nsummon him here's here's what i'm not willing to do take anyone's word for it that like uh\n\n33:06.560 --> 33:10.240\noh yeah our boss is over there in the pit he looks like a skeleton with a mustache on it but\n\n33:10.800 --> 33:16.640\nit's totally him i'd be like okay nazi if you see a skeleton with a mustache that was apparently\n\n33:16.640 --> 33:23.920\nburned like what was his mustache made and here's the thing like i guess uh the leaders of the time\n\n33:25.600 --> 33:31.520\nyou know they were all all of the world leaders were like yeah i'll believe it when i see it like\n\n33:31.520 --> 33:35.520\nit was kind of like an open thing that people are like oh yeah hitler's dead yeah right\n\n33:38.160 --> 33:42.720\nyeah but he was hitler signings even all over the united states like once people realized what\n\n33:42.720 --> 33:48.480\nhappened and that they didn't really have a body you start hearing all over the world people\n\n33:48.480 --> 33:53.040\nalso lots of people look like hitler they saw a hitler over by the pool they saw him everywhere\n\n33:53.040 --> 33:59.360\nbut they did they did find like a dental that jawbone that they set the russians the russians\n\n33:59.360 --> 34:04.560\nare the ones that finally verified it but they took so long it's almost like that's another it\n\n34:04.560 --> 34:09.440\njust becomes more suspicious i'm not new usually a conspiracy theory guy because i think conspiracy\n\n34:09.440 --> 34:15.920\ntheories are cheating because you you just raise questions and and now more than ever we all i i feel\n\n34:15.920 --> 34:24.640\nlike there's no such thing as conspiracy theory it's a conspiracy uh uh speaking of conspiracy\n\n34:24.640 --> 34:31.760\ntheories uh alex jones is uh has he has he been deleted from youtube i hear that's a conspiracy\n\n34:31.760 --> 34:38.400\nthey're using it as a way to earn money be like youtube's taking us down and only you can give us\n\n34:38.400 --> 34:45.760\nmoney to stop it and then youtube's like we don't care we fucking love nazis so did he did anything\n\n34:46.720 --> 34:51.200\ndid they take did they delete him from youtube or not as far as i understand\n\n34:54.000 --> 35:02.000\nthe what this is what's his name paul joseph watson that that uh he's a real piece of shit um but\n\n35:02.560 --> 35:06.800\nhe apparently admitted he was like no it's a fucking we're just using it to get a lot of money\n\n35:06.800 --> 35:14.160\nit's our our youtube's fine but it's that's i think illegal to do to say to certainly the\n\n35:14.160 --> 35:21.440\nnadir yeah wow the nadir of our civilization has to be at this point just because now we've we've\n\n35:21.440 --> 35:29.360\njust hit the bottom with these um the way we're treating these high school kids uh that are bothering\n\n35:29.360 --> 35:37.360\nafter i mean 20 years they they weren't alive when columbine happened and then this happens in their\n\n35:37.360 --> 35:44.320\nschool i don't give a fuck what these kids think is the appropriate response i'm certainly behind\n\n35:44.320 --> 35:50.240\nthem like no one's done anything for them it's like it's we're treating them like chickens in a\n\n35:50.240 --> 35:59.600\nfucking factory farm like we're like we're like putting them on a treadmill headed towards statistical\n\n35:59.600 --> 36:10.960\nlikelihood of mass death and uh and and the gall of anybody to say to a 16 to 17 year old kid who's\n\n36:10.960 --> 36:19.200\nwho's gonna go you know what uh hail mary uh uh maybe if instead of going home and shivering under\n\n36:19.200 --> 36:30.320\nmy bed and weeping um i uh say some shit and politicize this uh maybe maybe something will\n\n36:30.320 --> 36:36.480\nchange i like how do you how do you how do you fuck with that kid like like what like even if you\n\n36:36.480 --> 36:44.720\nare evil like just like what the fuck like it's it's great we've we've hit so far below rock bottom\n\n36:44.720 --> 36:51.520\nat that point where people are just like questioning these kids and making fun of them and like\n\n36:51.520 --> 36:57.200\nscrutinizing them and not just the conspiracy theorists but really the the more vile of the\n\n36:57.200 --> 37:02.880\ncharacters are the are the people that are like politically combating them and like going toe\n\n37:02.880 --> 37:10.400\nto toe with them with witty repartee that's like this is a child like like what the fuck\n\n37:10.400 --> 37:20.080\nhave we are we doing and and to beat the horse bloody i i i we we we ceremoniously ritualistically\n\n37:20.080 --> 37:27.120\nstripped katie rich snl writer who was off duty and made the joke baron trump's gonna be the first\n\n37:27.120 --> 37:33.520\nhomeschool shooter it's not even a joke that has to do with you know it's it's it's a it's a joke\n\n37:33.520 --> 37:41.760\nit was a joke about how that poor kid has the worst family ever and and is never gonna have a normal\n\n37:41.760 --> 37:50.000\nlife and and in this orgy of we won and we're taking over the world like katie rich was taken\n\n37:50.000 --> 37:56.080\nto a stake and she was tied to it and she was set on fire and she was burnt slowly and as far as i\n\n37:56.080 --> 38:01.520\nknow she's still laying low and enduring death threats and and whatever i don't know if she's\n\n38:01.520 --> 38:06.720\nrecovered or whatever i know she never got her job back at snl i know that they never had to even\n\n38:06.720 --> 38:11.680\ndo to the honor of telling her she was officially fired they just suspended her and then told her\n\n38:11.680 --> 38:19.360\nshe wasn't coming back like like we all took part in that because kids are off limits because when\n\n38:19.360 --> 38:26.960\nit comes to joking around we got one rule but when it comes to blowing people's bodies across the\n\n38:26.960 --> 38:33.680\nfloor we got no rules it's fucking it doesn't even mean anything to say the words it's insane\n\n38:33.680 --> 38:38.400\nanymore we've been saying it's insane the word insane means nothing did you hear that there's\n\n38:38.400 --> 38:42.960\nthat kid seventh grade who is going to shoot up his school but he went into the bathroom and killed\n\n38:42.960 --> 38:49.280\nhimself into the instead yeah it's getting to the point where we have to ask the mass shooters to\n\n38:49.920 --> 38:55.920\nlike solve their own end of the problem i'm so i'm sorry i'm laughing literally no one else can\n\n38:55.920 --> 39:01.840\ndo anything so if you're gonna shoot up a school why don't you kill yourself like that's that's\n\n39:01.840 --> 39:07.440\nwhere we're at in society is like the people who are willing to commit mass murders are like\n\n39:07.440 --> 39:12.880\nno this is this is actually crazy that i'm allowed to do this right so society is let this happen\n\n39:12.880 --> 39:18.480\nand we sit up here and we tell these kids like you know if you're having thoughts that you've\n\n39:18.480 --> 39:24.080\nnever had before your your body is surging with hormones you you have god knows what going on\n\n39:24.080 --> 39:30.320\nlike like please just talk about it like don't hurt yourself don't hurt other people just talk\n\n39:30.320 --> 39:35.440\nto someone about it talk to someone you can trust here's your hotlines like you know we we try to\n\n39:35.440 --> 39:42.560\nhandle these kids with care when kids do something wrong we try them in a different court we we the\n\n39:42.560 --> 39:47.520\nidea is that before a certain age your your your neurology is forming and we we're supposed to be\n\n39:47.520 --> 39:55.200\nprotecting you it's it's it's insane that this is up for debate now it's it's it's insane that\n\n39:55.200 --> 40:05.040\nthat grown ass adults are are having like fucking weird flame wars with recent survivors of mass\n\n40:05.040 --> 40:13.280\noccurs who are not old enough to vote yet um and who are just saying maybe if i say so i just can't\n\n40:13.280 --> 40:20.480\ni mean i know that we all feel this way but what like how much further do we need to go\n\n40:20.480 --> 40:29.840\nbefore the moral majority an unfortunate borrowing of a different groups uh title but the the silent\n\n40:29.840 --> 40:37.920\nfucking normals the the the the relatively sane of us how how much further are we gonna get before\n\n40:37.920 --> 40:45.360\nwe go the rules are done now they don't have rules maybe it's like the third of the population\n\n40:45.360 --> 40:50.400\nthat's just never votes because they don't believe in the system and they're just watching the whole\n\n40:50.400 --> 41:04.880\nthing burn down and it's like i yeah i i i stand where you stand uh a non-voter a disenfranchised\n\n41:04.880 --> 41:10.800\nperson person who doesn't think that anything but like okay but you gotta agree with me now\n\n41:11.840 --> 41:18.160\nright there is a difference between watching a system that is fucked up and rolling your\n\n41:18.160 --> 41:25.120\neyes at it and watching children be abused like there's got to be a difference there's\n\n41:25.120 --> 41:30.880\ngot to be a point where and and and i guess what it's like not only not only do we have to stop\n\n41:30.880 --> 41:37.120\nplaying by the fucking rules that we made up and they've never followed but we've got to stop\n\n41:37.120 --> 41:42.960\nbitching at each other we've got to stop minding our fucking language with each other um we gotta\n\n41:42.960 --> 41:48.800\nput that shit on hold there not to mention the fact that there was a study just released that like\n\n41:48.800 --> 41:56.480\nnot shocking to me at all that uh the the average african-american family in 50 years has made\n\n41:56.480 --> 42:02.560\nabsolutely no progress in terms of of anything that actually matters the median income is\n\n42:02.560 --> 42:11.200\nprojected to be zero dollars it it's like like like that's fucking predictable and it's it's\n\n42:11.200 --> 42:16.480\nfucking that should be a huge wake-up call for us we started trying to fix these problems by\n\n42:16.480 --> 42:21.520\nminding our language in the 90s and we had that wave and then it subsided and all these things\n\n42:21.520 --> 42:27.520\npeople are laughing all the way to the bank when we ignore the the fundamentals of behavior and\n\n42:27.520 --> 42:34.080\nclass systems and things and and and we got we we are we have fallen for the oldest trick in the\n\n42:34.080 --> 42:40.880\nbook when we are standing at a at a at a at a protest with each other and someone uses the\n\n42:40.880 --> 42:46.160\nwrong pronoun and we get in a fight with them instead of fucking facing off with the fucking\n\n42:46.160 --> 42:52.240\npeople with baby skulls on their helmets who are laughing at us because they have lost their souls\n\n42:52.240 --> 42:58.960\nto apathy they have lost their souls to to choices they made so long ago that if they\n\n42:58.960 --> 43:05.200\nun-make them now they'd be twice as humiliated as if they just went to hell and died not in that\n\n43:05.200 --> 43:11.280\norder they they they they they they it's

hope for the future that i didn't have because i was\n\n55:34.080 --> 55:40.320\nreally worried about the the next generation coming into adulthood and voting because it's\n\n55:40.320 --> 55:46.480\nright around the corner for them and if the rest of the teenagers of america are cutting through\n\n55:46.480 --> 55:54.640\nthe bullshit as easily as these kids then we might actually be

once we see that\n\n56:14.880 --> 56:23.120\nthe cynic in me thinks that while all this awesome progressive revolutionary activist movement is\n\n56:23.120 --> 56:29.200\nhappening among like high school kids there's a bunch of other kids who are going to perfect the\n\n56:29.200 --> 56:35.760\nart of being fascists and and perfect the art of running for office and being more

truth\n\n57:00.000 --> 57:07.760\nand like the more awful shit is to come by far there's no way that trump is the end of the road\n\n57:07.760 --> 57:15.120\non oh we we had a we made a boo boo america we had a bad president we're gonna the next one's\n\n57:15.120 --> 57:20.960\ngonna be so much worse and we're gonna have to outgrow the idea that that the office of presidency\n\n57:20.960 --> 57:28.720\nmeans anything at all it's a stupid clerical office that shouldn't be a celebrity gig the idea\n\n57:28.720 --> 57:35.440\nthat we need leaders is the idea that we're we've decided that we're going to be um ancient roam\n\n57:36.080 --> 57:43.600\nthe republic must die so we can start worshiping dictators um the world is turning towards\n\n57:43.600 --> 57:50.720\nautocracy all over the world um the next generation of autocrats and oligarchs are\n\n57:50.720 --> 57:55.520\ngoing to be ours they're gonna be our children born in the fucking crucible of these fucking\n\n57:55.520 --> 58:03.520\nuh high school shootings and shit we've just proven to ourselves that democracy is uh awkward\n\n58:03.520 --> 58:12.000\nand untenable and the simpler thing is to let let uh dictators rule which is why goodness can't be\n\n58:12.000 --> 58:18.880\nshackled by politeness it can't be shackled by anything because the only chance that we have\n\n58:18.880 --> 58:22.640\nand i don't want to talk about it in terms of chances because the funny thing that happens is\n\n58:22.640 --> 58:28.960\nwhen you you know we all we also don't want to lose that we want to protect ourselves and that's\n\n58:28.960 --> 58:35.520\nhow a third of us end up siding with apathy and entropy and again i just want to say to those\n\n58:35.520 --> 58:44.560\npeople how about this how about we're going to lose how about we've already lost now the call\n\n58:44.560 --> 58:52.160\nto action to you is how do you want to go out do you want to kill a bunch of kids do you want to\n\n58:53.040 --> 58:57.920\nroll around in a pile of money that doesn't matter because it's all ending or do you want to find\n\n58:57.920 --> 59:06.160\nyour style find your voice emerge from your uh defensive self-protective shell of apathy\n\n59:07.360 --> 59:12.560\nso that you can be right about everything because yeah everything always falls apart\n\n59:12.560 --> 59:20.080\nyou if you stand back and say that i just i was that person too i still am that person i'm saying\n\n59:20.080 --> 59:28.480\nlike now that it feels like it's really getting close to the end like for shits and giggles\n\n59:30.240 --> 59:38.080\nlet's try some shit i don't know what that means but but i think these kids like the next generation\n\n59:38.080 --> 59:44.720\nis what church is saying is that thank god we actually see that you could shoot up a school\n\n59:44.720 --> 59:50.640\nand the kids that survive could actually turn out to have presence of mind concern for their fellow\n\n59:50.640 --> 59:57.200\nman i apparently forgiveness of the system that led them to the swatter enough that they would\n\n59:57.200 --> 01:00:02.800\nrather to try to reach out to it um they didn't all turn into little hitlers they didn't all\n\n01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:07.040\nturn into little beavers and buttheads they didn't turn into little sydvicious's they didn't turn\n\n01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:15.680\ninto little rick sandcheses a handful of them at least turned into little uh activists activists\n\n01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:21.120\nand and and and we need 20 of them for every one of these people that jeff's talking about because\n\n01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:26.560\nof course they're gonna everybody that's grows up in this new world is gonna like the the the the\n\n01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:33.520\nthe it's yeah the high iq fascists are coming and they're gonna i hope to see on you know\n\n01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:41.440\nmarch 24th the march for our lives um that there are more teenagers on board with this\n\n01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:45.600\nmovement than or not and i think that that's what we're gonna see i think that it's gonna be\n\n01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:52.240\ni hope that it's going to be huge but already you know i mean kids are being told they can't\n\n01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:56.800\ngo in protest like you're gonna get in trouble if you go in protest because you're gonna skip school\n\n01:00:56.800 --> 01:01:03.280\nwhatever and kids are saying fuck you and so people are trying to keep these kids who want to\n\n01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:09.760\njoin in the fight from doing it by saying follow the rules and they're not following the rules\n\n01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:14.880\nconstitutional yeah i'm decided on a supreme court case if you're if you're one of these\n\n01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:20.400\nkids and you can hear me like you just yeah you can't you can't listen to any of us you can't\n\n01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:24.400\nit's right that's the thing because even us telling you this is us manipulating you and\n\n01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:28.320\nthat's the one thing you shouldn't do is get co-opted by anybody because that's that will\n\n01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:34.240\nhappen if you're successfully co-opted by alex baldwin then you become uh successfully dismissible\n\n01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:38.800\nas a pawn like if somebody if somebody starts funding you somebody starts if there's an adult\n\n01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:44.080\nat one of your meetings where you're planning a march or something uh then the enemy gets to\n\n01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:50.480\nrightfully say well these aren't real kids this is a children's crusade they're still\n\n01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:55.920\nfucking assholes well they're right they're they're they're they would be valid in saying that if\n\n01:01:55.920 --> 01:02:02.000\nsomeone bought bought them and started coordinating them saying kids um uh don't skip school we can\n\n01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:06.960\ndo it on a saturday afternoon my name is mr hendershaw and i'm the i'm the 48 year old liberal\n\n01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:12.800\nthat's gonna like help you out thanks for thanks for having we we we was is it what an amazing\n\n01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:20.000\nconcept 16 year old speaking up um um wow uh now let's use that to get maxine waters elected\n\n01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:25.040\nlike i just don't trust anybody kids like like because it won't it doesn't matter if their heart's\n\n01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:29.920\nin the right place or not your power right now is that you're all that we have left your power is\n\n01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:35.680\nthat we is that you're supposed to be off of the monopoly board and and and the game has has become\n\n01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:41.280\nnot a game anymore and you're the only thing that can help us think about the pressure uh what's\n\n01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:48.080\nwhat's the uh the uh i call bs girl's name uh emma gonzalez emma gonzalez she now has way\n\n01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:55.200\nmore followers on twitter than the nr a and she's what 17 18 years old and the nr a has\n\n01:02:55.200 --> 01:03:04.320\nfucking dank ass memes too so to be able to to be that day the nr a has dank ass fucking dank\n\n01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:13.680\nass memes bro there's our show title i don't know uh but like like she like she was eloquent\n\n01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:22.480\nin the in the face of a massacre and now she's going to be held to a horrible scrutiny of like\n\n01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:31.920\nlike of asshole men and like men's rights activists and all this shit nr a fucking loony tunes like\n\n01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:40.480\nshe now her life is now having to be famous for speaking up but also i think it's crazy\n\n01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:48.000\nthat the idea that we have to worship leaders of any kind like i say pour all that energy to\n\n01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:54.000\nprotecting these kids and it really has to be literally protecting them it can't be helping\n\n01:03:54.000 --> 01:04:01.280\nthem it has to be shielding them um because it it it's good to be disenfranchised by politicians\n\n01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:07.600\nand this is what happens to a society in in total crisis is that it's like it's like these kids are\n\n01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:15.600\ngoing to either be eaten alive um in which case the dragon's going to get even stronger\n\n01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:20.080\nand it's we'll just look at it as a children's crusade there was just the final death throes of\n\n01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:26.320\nsanity which we sent our children marching into into the fray and and because we were we were out\n\n01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:32.960\nof soldiers um or birming in alabama they sent the kids out to protest they all got hosed down and\n\n01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:37.920\nthe dogs were sent on them and it was like a major turning point right these these these poor kids\n\n01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:45.120\nbefore anyone i'm 45 and i have i don't have a bone in my body that's prepared to make a sacrifice\n\n01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:51.040\nand these kids are 16 and they they they have to endure an actual christ myth like they have to\n\n01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:57.520\nactually atone with an with some fucking crazy garden of guest them any um uh impersonal force\n\n01:04:57.520 --> 01:05:05.040\nthat answers by not answering when you say take this cup away uh and they they have to march\n\n01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:12.560\nforward to golgotha um knowing that there is no fucking like celebration at the end of it\n\n01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:18.560\nthey got that is like like it's only going to be abuse as like you you're going to have your\n\n01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:25.760\nchildhood taken away from you i i i i i think that happened when that's why if we if we care at all\n\n01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:31.840\nwe have to just we have to just we have to just whatever this means figuratively we have to just\n\n01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:39.200\ngather around them in a giant bubble with our backs to them facing outward um while they do\n\n01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:46.000\nwhatever they want to do until they drop dead from exhaustion and any bullet fired their direction\n\n01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:50.800\nfiguratively or literally hits one of us and that's what we have to do that's what's that's what's\n\n01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:57.440\nupon us in the face of this if we care i don't know what that means i don't know how that actually\n\n01:05:57.440 --> 01:06:02.560\nphysically like expresses itself i don't know what to do i just feel like i just i just want\n\n01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:13.440\nthese kids to understand like that you know sorry like like like start sorry that our football team\n\n01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:19.760\nso shitty that you're on the field with no equipment um and the ball is spiraling in the air\n\n01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:26.000\nand there's 400 linebackers headed towards you i don't know anything about football\n\n01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:35.840\nbut uh should we just porch corner but but but i but i do know either either by virtue of the\n\n01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:40.000\nfact that we were we were never going to win or by virtue of the fact that this is the only way\n\n01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:44.000\nwe're going to win that this is this is all this is all we got and you're doing the right thing\n\n01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:49.280\ndon't listen to your parents don't listen to your parents when they tell you they understand\n\n01:06:49.280 --> 01:06:53.840\ndon't listen to your parents when they tell you uh that your life is going to be ruined uh don't\n\n01:06:53.840 --> 01:07:01.200\ndon't don't don't listen to them don't don't don't let them trick you in any way you have to use them\n\n01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:08.640\nyou have to love them like but don't let them get in your head because they don't have the\n\n01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:15.840\nanswers i am your parents age i did nothing i watched i watched all you kids die when you were my age\n\n01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:27.520\nage and and i did nothing so don't listen to us accept support not advice is my advice if someone\n\n01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:36.400\nsays here's $500 make them sign a thing that says it's it's it's a gift i don't i don't know i i i\n\n01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:39.840\nguess actually spin on it and throw it back on their face because they've already taken like\n\n01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:46.880\ntwo and a half million dollars sorry i thought that was a joke no no yeah um that's what i mean\n\n01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:53.760\nit's like it doesn't invalidate them to take money it's like give them money no they're a movement now\n\n01:07:53.760 --> 01:08:00.240\nand movements need to raise funds to keep going you can't do this shit forever for free luckily\n\n01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:05.360\nthey've grown up in a world where it's like you can just go online and become this character and\n\n01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:10.320\nmake a living that way so they do kind of see this pathway but it's not just like they're not\n\n01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:15.840\njust you know like oh how do i become a public figure you know it's like they've seen people\n\n01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:21.680\ntheir age being public figures for years and years and they have a great reason to uh be out there\n\n01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:28.960\nyou know i hope we're we're we're dying empire it happens we had a good run uh we're portugal\n\n01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:36.160\nwe're we're we're england we're spain we're we ruled the world for a couple hundred years and it's\n\n01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:41.600\nover and we're not going to go gracefully into that good night we're not going to go gently\n\n01:08:42.320 --> 01:08:49.360\nwhat we're going to do is grab and profiteer as much as we can we're going to we're going to take\n\n01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:55.680\nlike the the people in power are going to steal as much as they can and then go team up with the\n\n01:08:55.680 --> 01:09:02.560\nnext new empire be that china or russia or north korea or whatever the fuck like like we did it\n\n01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:10.800\nwe're done we're fucked you can't be um a thousand year empire you can't be a rike that goes on for\n\n01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:18.080\nfucking on and on and on uh we blew it we had a chance we did kind of a good job we made a lot\n\n01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:23.280\nof white people rich uh we made a lot of black people unhappy and now we don't care about the\n\n01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:28.880\nmurder of our own children this is the end we actually had a pretty short run yeah it should\n\n01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:35.120\nhave been shorter we we've squandered a lot of it we're we're we're too greedy which we we we\n\n01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:39.120\nwell i don't think it's also a global phenomenon what's happening right now it's not just our it's\n\n01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:45.680\nnot just our american empire that's just because we lasted 200 years compared to i mean in rome\n\n01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:53.760\nlike you would go six generations before you got your mail like everything moved at the\n\n01:09:53.760 --> 01:10:01.920\nspeed of a campfire so like i i you know if you adjust for technological inflation we we were\n\n01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:09.440\noh yeah i yeah exactly like if it took 30 years to build an aqueduct 200 years managing eight\n\n01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:17.680\nbillion people uh yeah and all their money we burned brighter we burned faster we burned out\n\n01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:21.920\nand i i don't think there's any shame in that i think what you do is you go fuck it we're\n\n01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:26.480\nwe're portugal and now let's go out as the empire that at the at the eleventh hour\n\n01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:34.560\nlike uh fucking arnold and terminator two giving the thumbs up like like that thumb is we love our\n\n01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:44.720\nedward furlongs we love our kids like we were we lost we don't stop it change that quit it jeff\n\n01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:52.640\nlove kids i'm i'm i'm i'm agreeing with you you're right we we won't put that thumb up as we go down\n\n01:10:52.640 --> 01:11:00.720\ninto the uh into the thing we support david hog 1111 that's his that that's his twitter handle\n\n01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:07.440\nuh i don't think there's any shame in just saying like we are a great empire in a long\n\n01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:13.440\nline of great empires that had their run and it's over like we like now let's try to find a graceful\n\n01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:20.640\nway to enter into the next like into our middle age or we still got it come on man we win it back\n\n01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:27.600\nthe shame is in is in is in looting what what because we see that like the shame is inciting\n\n01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:33.200\nwith entropy it doesn't matter if entropy is going to win or not the shame is inciting with it i also\n\n01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:38.960\nthink that there's there's two things that kind of led to what's going on right now and you can\n\n01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:43.440\nlook back at realm for this example as well as one is the disbelief that it's even possible that\n\n01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:50.080\nthis can happen like there's this notion of american superiority and this american dream idea this ideal\n\n01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:56.720\nthat we're all kind of uh raised with that says like well america can never fail it will always\n\n01:11:56.720 --> 01:12:02.000\nwork out it will always work out so there's a sense of denial uh in the american spirit\n\n01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:06.960\nthat really is in disbelief of what's actually happening right now and then also on the flip\n\n01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:10.560\nside there's also the people who are like oh it's you know it's always been fucked up and it's\n\n01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:15.280\ngonna be fucked up and whatever it's over it's been over and why bother trying to change it\n\n01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:22.480\nso in between those two perspectives are people who might actually try to do something to make\n\n01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:30.960\nsomething better right now despite all evidence that it's either futile or whatever and you know\n\n01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:37.120\nthese kids are trying and maybe they maybe they succeed and maybe we can turn it around i think\n\n01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:43.360\nit's worth yeah jack quick doubting the kids it's well it's worth a fucking shot right i believe\n\n01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:47.680\nin kids there's a whole generation coming up right now we're about to see what happens where we have\n\n01:12:47.680 --> 01:12:53.600\nto like pick a new leader like like oh it's going to be this person that's going to save us there's\n\n01:12:53.600 --> 01:13:00.800\ngoing to be one new like figurehead that's going to save democracy that's crazy right that approaches\n\n01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:09.200\nflawed yeah yeah and so like like yes turn out go vote go change in uh you know at the midterms\n\n01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:15.920\nlike like go go make things happen but also don't root for your next bernie sanders or hillary or\n\n01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:22.800\nor trump or whoever like the idea that we have to pick one person to make things all right to be the\n\n01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:29.280\nleader like of our rock band uh it's crazy but i don't see that happening what i see is a lot of\n\n01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:33.840\npeople suddenly actually getting involved in their local governments holding their representatives\n\n01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:38.560\naccountable starting to go to these town hall meetings starting to make phone calls all shit\n\n01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:43.120\nlike that we've learned in the last year more than we ever knew before about how government works\n\n01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:47.680\nbecause of this catastrophe we are sort of there is a silver lining here with trump is a sort of\n\n01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:53.680\nlike he's a rodeo clown and he's a as jeff says he's a amateurs autocrat yeah he also is sort of\n\n01:13:53.680 --> 01:14:00.000\nlike a thinly veiled drape over the fact if we play our cards right if we get through this it could\n\n01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:05.520\nbe the way that we realize the important thing which is that the office of the president is not\n\n01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:12.400\nis not supposed to be empowered and isn't that empowered that that that we are a republic and\n\n01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:17.680\nthat our representatives in all of this is this fucked up cheer system that this is an incredibly\n\n01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:24.240\nimportant this this should be like underpaid low-level nerds that take care of us that you\n\n01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:28.640\ncan tell to go fuck themselves because if they can't handle being talked to by a 16 year old\n\n01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:34.320\nthat's just been shot at by an air 15 like they're a fucking moron then they don't qualify for the\n\n01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:40.800\njob get me in get me a fucking accountant in that office get me a lawyer in that office so i i have\n\n01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:46.640\na million people on my payroll who know full well that that that that whether they like me or not\n\n01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:50.880\nthey could go home and fantasize about me falling downstairs and breaking my neck but during the\n\n01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:56.000\n10 minute phone call about my taxes they go absolutely absolutely that's what you're supposed\n\n01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:02.720\nto say to the american public if you're a fucking congress person and and and these these are the\n\n01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:09.120\npeople that are important and and and they need to stop fucking acting like just because they're\n\n01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:15.840\nbelow the radar that they're like not capable of shitting up our country and they're they're\n\n01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:22.080\nbeing held accountable for the first time ever because also with such an inept leader which\n\n01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:27.600\nis where everyone usually is looking is that the the the you know the the wizard of Oz sitting up\n\n01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:31.840\non top of the hill is supposed to be the source of everything meanwhile there's all these other\n\n01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:36.640\ncogs in the machine that no one's really thinking are very important and they never are in their own\n\n01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:41.040\ndamn states they're not actually talking to the people that they represent they're all up in\n\n01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:46.720\nwashington talking to lobbyists and shit so now that we have this inept guy in the office of the\n\n01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:53.200\npresidency suddenly people going wait how does this work okay so i have to deal with my state\n\n01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:57.280\nlegislators and okay who are they where do i find the directory for the people i call about this\n\n01:15:57.280 --> 01:16:02.720\nshit that's happening we need campaign reform so fucking bad it's it's it's been the most ludicrous\n\n01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:07.120\njourney it's just like going like over and over again 85 percent of the american public\n\n01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:14.320\n87 percent um that you better believe that includes all the fucking people that hate each other\n\n01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:20.160\nall agree campaign reform i don't know who the fuck these 15 percent are i guess they're probably\n\n01:16:20.160 --> 01:16:25.520\nthe fucking parasites the the the rich people and but everyone else is like yeah you gotta get money\n\n01:16:25.520 --> 01:16:31.520\nout of politics you just gotta get it out it's not it doesn't work and then so okay what's the first\n\n01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:37.600\nstep well let's make a law against money in politics okay let's take that vote uh come to order all\n\n01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:44.160\nthe people it's an absurd it's like a comedy sketch like but we got to that poor mailman who\n\n01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:50.080\nrode his helicopter bike under the front steps of the capital law and whatever the that it was\n\n01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:55.600\njust like i just he had one message campaign reform we need that so bad it would solve every other\n\n01:16:55.600 --> 01:17:02.480\nproblem make these people civil servants make that make this job that you know why tv is good now\n\n01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:08.320\nbecause they're getting so many channels so many ways to watch tv that all the shit-faced\n\n01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:16.640\ncoke addict fucking uh suit clad assholes that never gave a fuck about what you watched on television\n\n01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:24.160\nand looked at tv as a great way to fuck actresses and make a bunch of money their salaries didn't\n\n01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:31.120\nget very high like like they started getting bored and they left and breaking bad happened\n\n01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:38.320\nlike like that is what you do to this country if you want to save it you suck the fucking money\n\n01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:43.680\nout of the spots that are important you suck the capitalism out of the things that are crucial\n\n01:17:43.680 --> 01:17:52.400\neducation medicine uh and for my money the transformers franchise hell yeah what about\n\n01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:56.400\nthe you know what that should never

01:24:42.480\nprobably won't know you're kind of like i think i think dan could i think i could do it no that's\n\n01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:51.120\nnot no of course i could do it question is will i

01:25:02.720\nbest original screenplay that's what he told me i found out tv is a better racket than movies you\n\n01:25:02.720 --> 01:25:10.400\nknow i'm i'm i'm as long as i got my pride spencer how about you what category best supporting\n\n01:25:10.400 --> 01:25:17.360\nactress right what are we talking about i was i was gonna say the same thing went by the way\n\n01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:22.240\nwith all of our our non-binary uh revolution what are we what are we gonna chop into that with an\n\n01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:33.360\nice pick what well the concept that that that acting is divided by gender two genders instead of yeah\n\n01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:41.600\ni mean what oh shit yeah well yeah how far away are we from like like best act like whatever the\n\n01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:47.200\npronoun probably just actor right like like like like but without yeah without having this like\n\n01:25:47.200 --> 01:25:52.960\nactress and actress and well i i mean the thing that will make that happen is when somebody is a\n\n01:25:52.960 --> 01:26:01.280\ntrans character that wins best transgender role and they can't say best actor or actress well\n\n01:26:01.280 --> 01:26:06.240\nin you know in most cases they will be able to because they'll be identifying as either a man\n\n01:26:06.240 --> 01:26:13.840\nor a woman right so that it have to be a very specific like a gender trans person yeah we got\n\n01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:20.960\nsome time i wonder who won best cisgender male tonight yeah so yeah we will never give in yet\n\n01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:26.320\nwe will always be cisgender\n\n01:26:29.440 --> 01:26:36.000\ni am coming out in a state of heteronormative nature yes i will be headed we will be heteronormative\n\n01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:41.440\non the beaches we will be heteronormative in the fields we'll be heteronormative on the landing\n\n01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:45.920\ngrounds we'll always be cisgender did that thing really happen where he got on the subway and asked\n\n01:26:45.920 --> 01:26:50.560\neverybody whether no it didn't happen he didn't get on the goddamn subway pole\n\n01:26:52.560 --> 01:27:00.240\nhello governor i'm a fucking uh my name is roger jones that's bullshit never if it happened\n\n01:27:00.240 --> 01:27:07.280\nfuck you it certainly if it happened fuck you it certainly didn't happen on his way back to the\n\n01:27:07.280 --> 01:27:12.320\nhouse of lords to go deliver that speech where he goes you know what i just talked to eight people\n\n01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:17.920\nthat weren't rich people and they really fucking well i also did the funny thing about that about\n\n01:27:17.920 --> 01:27:23.200\nthat scene is that it's used as if it's a plot point but what he does with that information is he goes\n\n01:27:23.200 --> 01:27:31.600\nhe goes back to his political parasite friends and says i i talked to mary joe peasley and\n\n01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:38.560\ngeronimo johnson and and and and and they take his word for it and it's almost like it's almost\n\n01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:44.640\ni think maybe the story is that he said i once he won best actor well that's what i'm saying\n\n01:27:44.640 --> 01:27:50.000\ni mean he just he just won it he won it like 25 minutes ago fuck him but but but but but but\n\n01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:55.360\nthat's what i'm saying yeah i think that's is that that was that was the actual point of the story\n\n01:27:55.360 --> 01:28:01.520\nis that he whether he did it or not he said he did it so if he didn't do it the story is that he\n\n01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:07.680\nlied they probably truncated the fact that he actually did go listen to some like common people\n\n01:28:08.480 --> 01:28:13.920\nand do it but the fact that he went on a subway and then that was what made that speech happen i\n\n01:28:13.920 --> 01:28:20.240\nfind a little like it's another one of those things where i what was the other thing sometimes i see\n\n01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:25.680\nsomething oh it was like it was the uh cheeseburger phone calling frost nixon i i where i'm like\n\n01:28:25.680 --> 01:28:34.720\nthat's so like jammed down the

all right you guys were in dore nester on the\n\n01:29:33.440 --> 01:29:39.920\nquest for patching's gem you infiltrated the town to get information and you found some\n\n01:29:39.920 --> 01:29:46.720\ninformation that seemed to link this mysterious theater that seemed to be some sort of institution\n\n01:29:46.720 --> 01:29:53.760\nin the town to shrove and also information that said that shrove might be in the bathroom of a\n\n01:29:53.760 --> 01:29:59.520\ntavern so you decided to have juxtro from the tavern after the tavern master told you that\n\n01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:05.440\nthat would be a bad idea and it resulted in a big brawl so you guys escaped from the brawl and the\n\n01:30:05.440 --> 01:30:13.120\nbrawl followed you outside into a back alley where uh you guys escaped um after jeff started a fire\n\n01:30:13.120 --> 01:30:19.360\nand then dan used like uh essentially a flash bomb like a like a like a blinding light to cover your\n\n01:30:19.360 --> 01:30:26.400\nexit um then you met up with a shambling mound who took you to safety in uh that was north of a pig\n\n01:30:26.400 --> 01:30:34.480\nfarm in the wall of the city the Schrab here right now um well he's not in the building uh yeah\n\n01:30:34.480 --> 01:30:41.360\nSchrabs here quiet yeah he's just doing that thing he does where he he's in stealth Schrab mode he's\n\n01:30:41.360 --> 01:30:48.720\nin silent running the well-known secret Schrab there's a well-known behaviors of Schrab that was\n\n01:30:48.720 --> 01:30:56.560\nmy fault that was a dumb question it's fine so uh yeah you were north of of uh yeah this pig farm\n\n01:30:56.560 --> 01:31:02.480\nin this kind of wreckage of a wall that he was calling a house and it had a window in it um\n\n01:31:02.480 --> 01:31:08.880\nso you had shrove you started i'll say interrogating although that's a really loose way to refer to it\n\n01:31:08.880 --> 01:31:14.720\nouch um to everyone's a critic i am yeah no that's that's most of my job is critiquing what you guys\n\n01:31:14.720 --> 01:31:21.840\nare doing and being frustrated um so we didn't torture him good enough i we we he had a feel\n\n01:31:21.840 --> 01:31:26.640\nlike you might have a dragon tattoo on his back was that important did we they hit a hit a dragon\n\n01:31:26.640 --> 01:31:31.440\nmark tattoo well i did say it so yeah it was a dragon tattoo that we identified with one of gary\n\n01:31:31.440 --> 01:31:38.240\nshamblings books as being part of this dragon cult that uh dragon mark not a cult so wait well it's a\n\n01:31:38.240 --> 01:31:46.720\ndr and we asked him as uh can he read the uh guild script in the uh note so he translated the note\n\n01:31:46.720 --> 01:31:52.320\nand and he wouldn't he stopped short of giving us the location of the drop point for pachens gem\n\n01:31:52.320 --> 01:31:59.280\nright he but we know that the note had a drop point and that the time was within hours and gary\n\n01:31:59.280 --> 01:32:04.640\nit was drop point north right yeah and Garry Shandling also had a map that had all of like a\n\n01:32:04.640 --> 01:32:08.960\nlist of locations in or around the town and it was written in that guild language so you couldn't\n\n01:32:08.960 --> 01:32:13.920\nread it but it also seemed to have locations on it is Garry is Garry Shandling still with us right now\n\n01:32:13.920 --> 01:32:20.400\nyou just asked that answer me again well i'll get there well let them let them go finish the yeah\n\n01:32:20.400 --> 01:32:27.520\nso you guys had that you were on the cusp of making a big discovery and um then instead of holding\n\n01:32:27.520 --> 01:32:33.120\nhim i think i think you switched to tying him up but uh dan had steve tie him up and steve did a\n\n01:32:33.120 --> 01:32:38.480\nbad job tying him up so he ended up just kind of slipping out of his bindings and sneaking out of\n\n01:32:38.480 --> 01:32:42.240\nthe window although it would be fair when he started sneaking out of the window you guys kind\n\n01:32:42.240 --> 01:32:46.480\nof just let him leave like you didn't chase him or like try and grab i can speak to that\n\n01:32:47.680 --> 01:32:54.160\ni think your memory is you're kind of looking back on it going am i a great dungeon master\n\n01:32:54.880 --> 01:33:00.720\nand you're gonna tend to go yeah no i think i'm terrible well here's what happened it was a bit of\n\n01:33:00.720 --> 01:33:10.880\na fracas right we were beating him um yeah and he according to you he fucking like ninjaed out of\n\n01:33:10.880 --> 01:33:16.720\nhis ropes and started beating the fuck out of us i don't think revealing himself to be super\n\n01:33:17.920 --> 01:33:24.400\npowerful and then he like blew out the window like a goddamn pixie i like like it was it was\n\n01:33:24.400 --> 01:33:28.320\nyou're making it seem like we watched him slowly crawl out the window like this guy\n\n01:33:28.320 --> 01:33:33.360\nlike like revealed that he had like npc powers that were like you're never supposed to kill me i'm\n\n01:33:33.360 --> 01:33:37.760\nsupposed to fucking kill you and it's jump jump and it was like yeah i was like and then he like\n\n01:33:37.760 --> 01:33:42.400\njumped out the window like a laser beam i don't i mean i'll believe you if you say he attacked but\n\n01:33:42.400 --> 01:33:46.400\ni don't remember him attacking you i just remember you guys all had combat turns i didn't try and i\n\n01:33:46.400 --> 01:33:53.280\ngrab him down that this is trove won't cooperate we beat him up yeah he for sure kicked our ass\n\n01:33:53.280 --> 01:33:57.680\nhe took a piece out of us i think he fought you pretty hard when you initially fought him in the\n\n01:33:57.680 --> 01:34:02.240\ndark but i don't remember him fighting you really hard enough but i can't i was already almost dead\n\n01:34:02.240 --> 01:34:07.360\nwhich is why that's the problem yeah yeah that that's the thing is you're already almost dead\n\n01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:15.840\nso he escaped into the night um i also have written down spencer in my notes that the top\n\n01:34:15.840 --> 01:34:22.640\npriority is the purse that was the light that was what the note said the note said the purse the\n\n01:34:22.640 --> 01:34:30.160\npurse is up the the purse is the gem drop point north is the town of door naster uh all right go\n\n01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:37.520\nahead um so then you guys you were like i don't know what we should do and um then pat no not\n\n01:34:37.520 --> 01:34:43.200\npatching steve was like uh i know what we should do ask more questions and you went to the store\n\n01:34:43.200 --> 01:34:48.240\nowner and the store owner was like i don't know and then he sprayed you in the face with presumably\n\n01:34:48.240 --> 01:34:53.760\nknockout juice and uh you guys were like we love this adventure we're on and we want to keep doing\n\n01:34:53.760 --> 01:35:00.720\nthe adventures forever well i mean are you is that your way of giving us a second chance no no that\n\n01:35:00.720 --> 01:35:06.480\nwas just my memory are you doing it bit are you guys doing a bit where you pretend not to remember\n\n01:35:06.480 --> 01:35:10.720\nanything that happened but then suddenly have perfect memory of certain moments i do have\n\n01:35:10.720 --> 01:35:15.520\nperfect memory of one aspect of it which is that i fully fucking bailed in humiliation\n\n01:35:15.520 --> 01:35:20.480\nand i i was like i don't know what i'm doing we fucked up at the house where we set the\n\n01:35:20.480 --> 01:35:24.400\nguy's house on fire we fucked up here again and i started walking down the road with my\n\n01:35:24.400 --> 01:35:31.360\ncompatriots and one of them the erstwhile diarrhea jr doubled back over our protests to go to go\n\n01:35:31.360 --> 01:35:37.040\nfucking hang out hang out in a town that nobody likes us in that we're we just yeah and and that\n\n01:35:37.040 --> 01:35:42.880\nwas the way we ended it is that jeff and i were like on the road and we had told this kid don't\n\n01:35:42.880 --> 01:35:48.000\ngo back and he went back and then you told him he got captured and then that's where we had said\n\n01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:53.440\nfuck i don't remember fuck passions gem we're gonna go back to town and start start a new right\n\n01:35:53.440 --> 01:35:58.960\nwell i'm very happy to rewind a little bit so that we're not on the road leaving town because\n\n01:35:58.960 --> 01:36:07.840\ni feel like the benefit of a month of thinking about our decisions is like well is dry there's\n\n01:36:07.840 --> 01:36:14.320\na drop point in in doran ester drop point north we did we're on the quest for passions gem passions\n\n01:36:14.320 --> 01:36:21.040\ngem is being dropped off like like so i don't know where you want to place us and i gave my version\n\n01:36:21.040 --> 01:36:26.720\nand yeah what do you want to definitely call it quits and i ran back i don't remember how do you\n\n01:36:26.720 --> 01:36:32.800\nwant to how do you want to you're outside of town well that okay yeah so we have left uh\n\n01:36:32.800 -->

fuck this i'm a young upstart with nothing\n\n01:36:43.920 --> 01:36:49.200\nto lose or you know whatever like the kids like the kids from the shooting yeah that was when i\n\n01:36:49.200 --> 01:36:54.720\noriginally started writing this adventure i was like one of these days is gonna be a setup this is\n\n01:36:54.720 --> 01:37:00.960\ngonna be a socially resonant metaphor all right well it hit it hit home wait are so did we bail\n\n01:37:00.960 --> 01:37:07.760\non passions gem didn't we decide i did yes i'm not i'm not willing to corroborate that well i did\n\n01:37:07.760 --> 01:37:12.800\nwe were on the road outside of town because i said let's just just get out of here it's the\n\n01:37:12.800 --> 01:37:18.480\nreason i ran back into town i don't want to give up on it the area juniors is still on the quest\n\n01:37:18.480 --> 01:37:24.720\nfor passions gem you and i said fuck it let's just restart let's let's hit control alternate\n\n01:37:24.720 --> 01:37:32.000\nlet's go somewhere else yeah do another thing but okay so where where are we standing right now\n\n01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:38.080\nSpencer uh you're outside of the town it's surrounded by a big thick wall that's about 10\n\n01:37:38.080 --> 01:37:43.840\n15 feet tall so it's like you're kind of outside it's a day or night it's nighttime it's dark um\n\n01:37:43.840 --> 01:37:50.960\nit's it's being lit by the flickering light of a town on fire are we on foot um me me and carlos\n\n01:37:50.960 --> 01:37:56.720\nyou're on foot yeah yeah there's a town i said to carlos carlos i feel bad that dj is back\n\n01:37:56.720 --> 01:38:05.600\nin town we like we're nothing if not a team we're not even good as a team but we're worse alone\n\n01:38:06.400 --> 01:38:16.240\nwe should go get dj back right look or don't look i mean i it's nighttime i'm not a good leader\n\n01:38:16.240 --> 01:38:24.400\nlike i i i i fucked up i just i just but i we were we were a team walking out of town\n\n01:38:24.400 --> 01:38:30.960\nand then diarrhea went back like he shouldn't have we told him not to okay i he'd be standing\n\n01:38:30.960 --> 01:38:38.320\nwith us right now if we if he had been a team i whistle i do like a like i can't do it i put\n\n01:38:38.320 --> 01:38:43.600\nmy fingers in the mouth and do a whistle that i think that diarrhea junior would recognize you make\n\n01:38:43.600 --> 01:38:51.920\nthe whistle yeah no you hear nothing he's all right well we we have to we have to get our ducks in\n\n01:38:51.920 --> 01:38:59.600\na row about this uh this this drop point like it's if we're if we're gonna complete the quest\n\n01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:09.680\nfor pachens gem it is upon us i would argue that uh diarrhea junior even it's like secondary to it\n\n01:39:09.680 --> 01:39:15.280\nbecause the deadline for one of them is within hours that's the one thing that we knew and we\n\n01:39:15.280 --> 01:39:22.400\njust don't know where in door nester uh the the drop point for the gem is drop point north we have\n\n01:39:22.400 --> 01:39:27.600\nto find drop i believe drop point north is door nester and it's the actual location within door\n\n01:39:27.600 --> 01:39:33.440\nnester that he wouldn't give us he read it and he wouldn't give it to us he's he's using that dragon\n\n01:39:33.440 --> 01:39:42.560\nmark uh knowledge to read the thing he saw crucial information i mean obviously he has\n\n01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:51.520\nmore loyalty to his kind i guess that would make him a person to follow if we could figure out where\n\n01:39:51.520 --> 01:40:06.400\nhe would go who uh shrove shrove yeah it'd go to the theater i mean drop point north if i'm a if i'm\n\n01:40:06.400 --> 01:40:15.440\na band of shitty people that doesn't mind killing people to get a gem and then i'm arranging to\n\n01:40:15.440 --> 01:40:27.600\ndrop it off and i mean where do you go i have no idea we can't go back into town they all know us\n\n01:40:29.840 --> 01:40:37.920\nwe can't go back to door nester i think we just we just set it on fire and and and uh i just i\n\n01:40:37.920 --> 01:40:44.880\nmean maybe the passions gem thing was just a wild goose chase maybe we just all right you know what\n\n01:40:45.920 --> 01:40:56.720\nlet's split the difference let's go rescue shitface shitface diarrhea the kid that he's your

01:46:34.320\ntrying to be sneaky it's not my specialty how do you okay so there's two main entrances in\n\n01:46:34.320 --> 01:46:40.640\nand out of doran ester or you could like climb over the wall or something yeah i mean what is the\n\n01:46:40.640 --> 01:46:45.920\nmain entrance guarded uh it's usually guarded but because of the fire the guards are helping with\n\n01:46:45.920 --> 01:46:52.560\nthe fire all right well looks like we can go on through we can sneak in where is he we're we're\n\n01:46:52.560 --> 01:46:55.280\nwe're we're gonna look i guess we go to the theater we go to the theater\n\n01:46:55.280 --> 01:47:07.600\nyeah so we remember where the theater is right we had there okay you go to the theater it's a\n\n01:47:07.600 --> 01:47:12.880\nlarge black modern looking building made out of black stained planks there's uh the large front\n\n01:47:12.880 --> 01:47:18.720\ndoor is uh is closed as it was before all right i don't recommend we knock\n\n01:47:18.720 --> 01:47:30.320\num i open the door all right it's locked i unlock the door how do you how do you try to do that\n\n01:47:30.320 --> 01:47:38.080\ni use my uh lock i don't know that you have thieves tools or anything let's look around the\n\n01:47:38.080 --> 01:47:44.560\nbuilding for other points of ingress okay all right around the back you can see there seems\n\n01:47:44.560 --> 01:47:49.200\nlike a little kind of kitchen area there's a small door and it's got a couple windows that's\n\n01:47:49.200 --> 01:47:55.200\nhow you can see there's like it looks kind of like a kitchen there's uh kitcheny stuff i try to open\n\n01:47:55.200 --> 01:48:00.480\none of the windows uh it's locked is there anybody uh in the kitchen uh no it seems like\n\n01:48:00.480 --> 01:48:06.400\nit's uh pretty quiet inside try the small door uh it's locked i take my quarter staff and break\n\n01:48:06.400 --> 01:48:15.520\na window and then i can clear out the glass we can crawl through all right you do it it's great you\n\n01:48:15.520 --> 01:48:21.360\npunch a hole clean through the window it's just like it's uh it's not like a big shattering it's\n\n01:48:21.360 --> 01:48:25.440\njust kind of like you just knocked a big chunk out of the glass and it just kind of landed on\n\n01:48:25.440 --> 01:48:31.760\nthe floor in one big piece perfect yeah you open the window can you when you get through can you\n\n01:48:31.760 --> 01:48:36.960\nopen the door for me yeah i i crawl through and open the window for him hell yeah that happens now\n\n01:48:36.960 --> 01:48:42.960\nyou're in a kitchen you see sausages and cheese oh yeah i take i take two sausages and one cheese\n\n01:48:43.680 --> 01:48:52.240\nokay just just in case that's fair all right uh what's our plan our plan is to find diarrhea\n\n01:48:52.240 --> 01:49:03.760\njunior or shrove well yeah i mean in that order i guess well we don't know yeah we don't know that\n\n01:49:03.760 --> 01:49:11.920\neither of them are here but i guess uh should we split up cover more ground yeah let's let's let's\n\n01:49:11.920 --> 01:49:17.840\nsplit up you like it when we split up right yeah there's only one door though okay let's not split\n\n01:49:17.840 --> 01:49:22.960\nup until we get through a door that has more than two doors let's stay together through this first\n\n01:49:22.960 --> 01:49:28.560\ndoor good idea i we open that door all right you you go through uh the door and you see a narrow\n\n01:49:28.560 --> 01:49:35.120\nhallway that leads into the main space of the uh theater itself like so you can see kind of the\n\n01:49:35.120 --> 01:49:40.880\nmain audience space and then the main stage which is a pretty huge construction there's catwalks overhead\n\n01:49:40.880 --> 01:49:48.080\nand kind of rigs for ropes and curtains and stuff like that to the right there's a door and then to\n\n01:49:48.080 --> 01:49:52.800\nthe and then past that door there's also another door to the right and then um then there's kind\n\n01:49:52.800 --> 01:49:57.840\nof like a backstage area but those are the only kind of rooms there's there's only the only rooms\n\n01:49:57.840 --> 01:50:04.800\nyou see are like these two rooms the kitchen and then this whole big kind of stage space uh well\n\n01:50:04.800 --> 01:50:13.120\nthere's two doors i'll take the first door i'll take the second okay i listen at mine first\n\n01:50:13.680 --> 01:50:20.080\nyou don't hear anything in either okay i open i try to open the first door it's uh it's a bathroom\n\n01:50:20.640 --> 01:50:24.800\nit looks like a nice bathroom like it's a performers bathroom i take a giant\n\n01:50:24.800 --> 01:50:33.040\nshit it's great you feel well taken care of okay what's behind my door it's like uh it's like a\n\n01:50:33.040 --> 01:50:37.200\ngreen room kind of lounge area there's just kind of sitting and it's kind of centrally\n\n01:50:37.200 --> 01:50:43.840\nlocated to be kind of near the stage and kind of out of the way it's uh pretty empty yeah nothing\n\n01:50:43.840 --> 01:50:49.760\nno no no ways out from there no it's just yeah it's just like uh like a dressing room let's\n\n01:50:49.760 --> 01:50:55.360\ncheck backstage all right so i'm done taking a poop and i come out and rejoin carlo so we go backstage\n\n01:50:55.360 --> 01:51:04.000\nall right all right you're searching around in the backstage and you find a number of levers\n\n01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:09.600\nthere's five levers they seem to be connected to various ropes and things uh like that like winches\n\n01:51:09.600 --> 01:51:17.200\nand pulleys and sandbags sort of things if we're running through here later let's pull all of these\n\n01:51:17.200 --> 01:51:21.680\nand maybe some shit will fall on the people chasing us yeah i like that all right uh anywhere\n\n01:51:21.680 --> 01:51:32.880\nanywhere to go um no it's just it's like behind a stage you know oh all right so we're just on\n\n01:51:32.880 --> 01:51:43.760\nstage let's go back to steve hey hey guys hey hey guys do you like pizza do you like pizza\n\n01:51:43.760 --> 01:51:54.160\npizza doesn't exist uh what are you talking about i actually don't know this is a good question\n\n01:51:54.960 --> 01:51:59.680\ndo you like the word pizza i just made it up yeah it sounds great cool me too bros for life\n\n01:51:59.680 --> 01:52:09.600\nbros for life hell yeah i like you guys we hate you why it seems unfounded i didn't do anything wrong\n\n01:52:09.600 --> 01:52:19.600\nyeah no you guys killed you you guys are like attacking our people who's you guys these strangers\n\n01:52:19.600 --> 01:52:25.280\nare coming into our town we saw you with them yeah because i'm like they're slave you saved me\n\n01:52:26.880 --> 01:52:35.200\nthat's a new development you didn't lead with that what you knew why you were captured\n\n01:52:35.200 --> 01:52:42.480\nwe i i mean you got to do what you're told to do when you're a slave but Steve while you're\n\n01:52:42.480 --> 01:52:47.200\ntalking you can hear footsteps above your head unlike the wooden boards\n\n01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:54.480\ni just start making fart noises really loud with my hands oh wait i can't do it with my hands so\n\n01:52:54.480 --> 01:53:01.120\nwhat i can do with my my mouth so i'm just going like i'm just like that's the sound like i know\n\n01:53:01.120 --> 01:53:11.520\nthat they'll understand what's happening you know like all right carlos you hear a farting sound\n\n01:53:11.520 --> 01:53:16.320\ndid you hear that fart sound followed by the sound of guards beating someone out it's hard not to\n\n01:53:16.320 --> 01:53:22.560\nabuse this inside information uh i heard a fart yeah i mean that's the sound that he always makes\n\n01:53:22.560 --> 01:53:32.160\nwhen he's in trouble sounds like he's below us yeah all right i i look for a way to get down\n\n01:53:32.160 --> 01:53:39.360\nlike below the stage um the stage is kind of sealed off but uh wait let's do a search if he's\n\n01:53:39.360 --> 01:53:44.000\nmaking those fart sounds either he just makes them constantly or he could hear that means that\n\n01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:49.360\nmeans that that's his way of communicating does that mean he could hear us up here he heard footsteps\n\n01:53:49.360 --> 01:53:57.040\nabove well i think then so did the bad guys well the bad guys are working steve over for making\n\n01:53:57.040 --> 01:54:05.280\nfarting sounds um but yeah it's the jeff you spy you spy the the thinnest faintest outline of a\n\n01:54:05.280 --> 01:54:12.080\nrectangle a trap door in the stage i open that rectangle trap door you can't it's like you can't\n\n01:54:12.080 --> 01:54:19.440\nyou can't sneak your little fingers in there it's so such a tight thing and levers i i i examine the\n\n01:54:19.440 --> 01:54:25.360\nlever mechanisms and see if like i assume like you know i i'm no stranger to the theater uh as a\n\n01:54:25.360 --> 01:54:31.920\nas a man of the cloth uh you know it's all performance um so i'm looking at pulleys and\n\n01:54:31.920 --> 01:54:36.560\nropes and going like well is there anything that i can rule out as something that would\n\n01:54:36.560 --> 01:54:42.400\npotentially open the trap door um there's one that seems like it's definitely not the trap\n\n01:54:42.400 --> 01:54:50.080\ndoor i found it's in the middle i got down to four okay i guess i just start pulling them all\n\n01:54:50.080 --> 01:54:56.800\nall right uh walk me through the methodology you start with one and then wait or something\n\n01:54:56.800 --> 01:55:02.960\nuh yeah because you know there's like cockpits smashing all the buttons simultaneously it's\n\n01:55:02.960 --> 01:55:10.800\ni'm one at a time i'm i'm no i'm just i'm going i'm going like this here's what i'm doing\n\n01:55:11.680 --> 01:55:19.920\ncrank crank crank crank like i'm not really waiting to see what happens okay um yeah you pull them all\n\n01:55:20.480 --> 01:55:25.440\na couple sandbags drop out of the out of like the rafters and stuff and smash into the ground\n\n01:55:25.440 --> 01:55:30.720\nand just kind of spill sand over and then uh the the trap door starts lowering in the stage\n\n01:55:30.720 --> 01:55:40.720\nsweet oh starts lowering like yeah it's like retracting into the below grounds like it's like a\n\n01:55:40.720 --> 01:55:45.840\nis it a hinge or what is it no it's like a lift oh okay so it's going down like a dumb waiter\n\n01:55:45.840 --> 01:55:54.400\nlike a power platform oh okay i i i get on that lowering platform uh you do that you're on it\n\n01:55:54.400 --> 01:56:01.440\nit's lowering what about you dan can i fit on there with oh yeah chad i could like hold a horse or\n\n01:56:01.440 --> 01:56:07.520\nall right well let's fucking do a horse eat low sources all right so we're lowering down on the\n\n01:56:07.520 --> 01:56:14.160\nthing yeah um yeah you go into the thing you see uh it's kind of like a waiting room um\n\n01:56:14.160 --> 01:56:18.400\nkind of area it's completely empty there's no one in it it seems like there's a place where you could\n\n01:56:18.400 --> 01:56:23.200\nput your weapons and other equipment and some coat racks and stuff it's just kind of like a\n\n01:56:23.200 --> 01:56:29.200\nwaiting area for you to hang out for you to stage goods in the platform area for the trap door and\n\n01:56:29.200 --> 01:56:40.320\nstuff there's a door hmm all right listen at the door yeah all right what do you what do you want\n\n01:56:40.320 --> 01:56:51.360\nto do how do you want to do this um i uh i'm looking for my spells real quick not that i think this\n\n01:56:51.360 --> 01:56:59.520\nis gonna be an issue but we should probably try to take one of them alive i'm not i'm not i'm not\n\n01:57:00.400 --> 01:57:06.640\nassuming we're gonna be able to kill them all dan you realize that your health is really low\n\n01:57:06.640 --> 01:57:13.120\nwait but i thought oh yeah i guess uh shit what do you think well i thought yeah i guess i lost\n\n01:57:13.120 --> 01:57:24.240\ntrack i thought that i uh i i give him some good berries do you have any well i can heal myself right\n\n01:57:24.240 --> 01:57:34.560\nyeah um how do i do that am i am i am i giving up a uh spell so if you find what spell loadout you\n\n01:57:34.560 --> 01:57:41.040\nhave you can turn any level one or two spell into a heal spell i'm gonna conveniently assume i was\n\n01:57:41.040 --> 01:57:47.360\ndoing loadout three offense i think you were so i will uh yeah i will sacrifice my inflict\n\n01:57:47.360 --> 01:57:58.320\nmoderate wounds touch um in order to heal myself how much damage does that do um 2d 8 plus one\n\n01:57:58.320 --> 01:58:04.720\nokay does that matter or the healing is the same basically so but what if i had said someone monster\n\n01:58:04.720 --> 01:58:11.200\ntwo well it's just specifically inflicted healer the same spell but opposite so so i couldn't i\n\n01:58:11.200 --> 01:58:16.400\nwouldn't have been able to sacrifice someone monster two to do a heal spell no you could\n\n01:58:17.760 --> 01:58:22.800\nand it would be the same then why did you ask oh you just asked us a shortcut because so you\n\n01:58:22.800 --> 01:58:34.400\ndidn't have to look it up right okay you gain back 12 health all right so uh what what's burning\n\n01:58:34.400 --> 01:58:39.440\nhands by the way i can't i can't find the descriptor it's an aoe spell it deals your level three i think\n\n01:58:39.440 --> 01:58:45.200\nit should deal 3d 4 damage in a big arc that's if i just touch people or it it shoots it out like a\n\n01:58:45.200 --> 01:58:51.600\nflamethrower aoe is age of empires all right so area of the fact we're it's it's after 10 o'clock\n\n01:58:51.600 --> 01:58:57.600\nso we we're at the door right now you're healed up we're ready to go in there and find diarrhea\n\n01:58:57.600 --> 01:59:07.920\njunior right mm-hmm so uh carlos that's diarrhea\n\n01:59:10.880 --> 01:59:16.720\num when

01:59:32.080\nthat's diarrhea i try to very quietly open the door okay\n\n01:59:34.720 --> 01:59:38.960\nsorry i'm rolling dice on my phone that's what's happening when you're sliding in the third\n\n01:59:38.960 --> 01:59:50.160\nand you think you later turd that's diarrhea you creak open the door with with a slight noise but\n\n01:59:50.880 --> 01:59:56.960\nit seems to be being masked by the noise of farting what do we see you see\n\n01:59:58.960 --> 02:00:05.200\none of the guys is punching diarrhea who's like on his side um being tied up he's got a big black\n\n02:00:05.200 -->
