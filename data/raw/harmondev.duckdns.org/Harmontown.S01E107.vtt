{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:25.860\nThis is for you Tommy Ramone.\n\n00:25.860 --> 00:34.860\nWe lost our last Ramone, everybody.\n\n00:34.860 --> 00:35.860\nWhat in all?\n\n00:35.860 --> 00:41.860\nWelcome back to Meltdown Comics, the Nerd Milk Theater.\n\n00:41.860 --> 00:53.860\nParment Town is now in session.\n\n00:53.860 --> 01:02.860\nJust in a moment, enjoying Tommy Ramone's drumming.\n\n01:02.860 --> 01:03.860\nWhat a good band.\n\n01:03.860 --> 01:08.860\nWe lost all of the original members, but they will live forever in our hearts.\n\n01:08.860 --> 01:17.860\nOn that note, welcome to the stage, the mayor of Parment Town, Mr. Dan Harmon.\n\n01:17.860 --> 01:22.860\nThank you.\n\n01:22.860 --> 01:27.860\nHi Ramones.\n\n01:27.860 --> 01:30.860\nYeah, did you ever see a movie called Rock and Roll High School?\n\n01:30.860 --> 01:32.860\nYeah, from the 80s.\n\n01:32.860 --> 01:35.860\nThe Ramones were kind of like heavily featured in that.\n\n01:35.860 --> 01:40.860\nPJ Souls character loves the Ramones, and she has a dream sequence where they're like,\n\n01:40.860 --> 01:43.860\nin her apartment, something, it's a cute movie.\n\n01:43.860 --> 01:49.860\nAnyways, PJ Souls was murdered by Michael Myers in the first Halloween movie, I believe.\n\n01:49.860 --> 01:50.860\nIs that right?\n\n01:50.860 --> 01:51.860\nI think so.\n\n01:51.860 --> 01:58.860\nThat movie, which is one of Jamie Lee Curtis' improper teen friends, has promiscuous sex\n\n01:58.860 --> 02:09.860\nand suffers the fate that all young ladies do at the hands of a brazen metaphor for syphilis, Michael Myers.\n\n02:09.860 --> 02:14.860\nIt's funny how horror movies, they don't really change that much in that one regard.\n\n02:14.860 --> 02:22.860\nThe teen culture being put on trial, you still don't really see...\n\n02:22.860 --> 02:28.860\nThat's basically all the horror movies that just continue to punish teens for the same crimes.\n\n02:28.860 --> 02:29.860\nFor growing up.\n\n02:29.860 --> 02:33.860\nFor experimenting, in any regard.\n\n02:33.860 --> 02:35.860\nFor not doing their homework.\n\n02:35.860 --> 02:37.860\nFor skinny dipping?\n\n02:37.860 --> 02:43.860\nYeah, we just keep killing them for being young.\n\n02:43.860 --> 02:48.860\nWhich was why Kevin Lewis was so awesome, because it kind of like concretized that mythology.\n\n02:48.860 --> 02:54.860\nWow, I'm boring the fuck out of myself.\n\n02:54.860 --> 02:58.860\nI was standing on the front walk outside my house today.\n\n02:58.860 --> 03:03.860\nI invited Erin down to do the show, because I know Camille couldn't be here, and I had her,\n\n03:03.860 --> 03:09.860\nhey, what am I, chopped liver?\n\n03:09.860 --> 03:14.860\nThe crowd was almost mutinous.\n\n03:14.860 --> 03:20.860\nHe actually could do the show, I told him not to, because I don't like what's going on around here.\n\n03:20.860 --> 03:24.860\nYou guys are getting a little too friendly.\n\n03:24.860 --> 03:27.860\nIt's called Harmontown.\n\n03:27.860 --> 03:29.860\nI don't get paid to do this shit.\n\n03:29.860 --> 03:31.860\nNot Silicon Valley.\n\n03:31.860 --> 03:35.860\nYeah, you can watch him on HBO, you love him so much.\n\n03:35.860 --> 03:40.860\nI love the image of him walking around in his underwear, looking for his Bruce Springsteen shirt.\n\n03:40.860 --> 03:43.860\nI've been thinking about that forever.\n\n03:43.860 --> 03:45.860\nThat's a whole different story.\n\n03:45.860 --> 03:48.860\nMaybe I just love the image of him in his underwear.\n\n03:48.860 --> 03:51.860\nMaybe it doesn't matter what he's looking for.\n\n03:51.860 --> 03:54.860\nMaybe I don't like to think he's looking for me.\n\n03:54.860 --> 04:01.860\nSo I was standing on the front walk, and Erin's coming down, Uber's in front.\n\n04:01.860 --> 04:07.860\nI still haven't gotten over my Uber addiction, no matter what they do to me.\n\n04:07.860 --> 04:10.860\nErin's coming down, and I look back.\n\n04:10.860 --> 04:15.860\nIt's a beautiful summer night in Los Angeles, and Erin's looking particularly beautiful.\n\n04:15.860 --> 04:23.860\nWe've been doing couples therapy, so I feel like I'm becoming a better lover.\n\n04:23.860 --> 04:26.860\nMentally, not physically.\n\n04:26.860 --> 04:28.860\nI look back.\n\n04:28.860 --> 04:33.860\nPhysically, you just picture Camille in his Bruce Springsteen shirt.\n\n04:33.860 --> 04:40.860\nI look back as she comes down the DreamWorks flagstone walkway that I have outside my house.\n\n04:40.860 --> 04:42.860\nI call it DreamWorks Flagstone.\n\n04:42.860 --> 04:45.860\nIt's a certain aesthetic.\n\n04:45.860 --> 04:48.860\nAnd what you guys don't...\n\n04:48.860 --> 04:51.860\nYou don't go to DreamWorks?\n\n04:51.860 --> 04:57.860\nThat brick they use.\n\n04:57.860 --> 05:06.860\nBased on how many people were in that building, I assume half of you directed Kung Fu Panda.\n\n05:06.860 --> 05:10.860\nSo she's halfway down, and I'm just taken with her beauty.\n\n05:10.860 --> 05:13.860\nShe's framed against a beautiful Los Angeles summer night.\n\n05:13.860 --> 05:19.860\nA smile creeps across my face as I'm watching her float down the walkway towards me,\n\n05:19.860 --> 05:25.860\nthinking about how in love with her I am and how lucky I am to be getting to spend the rest of my life with her.\n\n05:25.860 --> 05:30.860\nAnd she stops and she looks at me, looking at her that way, and she goes,\n\n05:30.860 --> 05:35.860\nAre you farting?\n\n05:35.860 --> 05:39.860\nI want to know what love is.\n\n05:39.860 --> 05:43.860\nWill you show me?\n\n05:43.860 --> 05:44.860\nYeah.\n\n05:44.860 --> 05:47.860\nDan, were you farting?\n\n05:47.860 --> 05:48.860\nIt was not.\n\n05:48.860 --> 05:51.860\nBecause those two concepts aren't mutually exclusive.\n\n05:51.860 --> 05:56.860\nYou could have been watching her float down the DreamWorks Flagstone and be farting at the same time.\n\n05:56.860 --> 06:02.860\nWe learned in couples therapy the proper structure of an apology, Jeff.\n\n06:02.860 --> 06:06.860\nApologies are not studied in contemporary society.\n\n06:06.860 --> 06:11.860\nThere's one man out there in the psychology community that studies apology.\n\n06:11.860 --> 06:15.860\nThe good ones, bad ones, fake ones.\n\n06:15.860 --> 06:19.860\nAnd the psychological community is always...\n\n06:19.860 --> 06:21.860\nHe's a controversial figure.\n\n06:21.860 --> 06:24.860\nYou might call him the Noam Chomsky of psychology.\n\n06:24.860 --> 06:26.860\nHe's a lone gunman out there.\n\n06:26.860 --> 06:28.860\nIs this your therapist or your therapist is quoting this person?\n\n06:28.860 --> 06:29.860\nShe's quoting this person.\n\n06:29.860 --> 06:31.860\nHe wrote a book called, I don't know, On Apology.\n\n06:31.860 --> 06:33.860\nI think the book is called.\n\n06:33.860 --> 06:35.860\nShe pulled it off her bookshelf and started reading from it,\n\n06:35.860 --> 06:37.860\nat which point I was like, what the fuck?\n\n06:37.860 --> 06:40.860\nIs this coming off my time?\n\n06:40.860 --> 06:44.860\nYou're reading another guy's book out loud.\n\n06:44.860 --> 06:46.860\nThis is insane.\n\n06:46.860 --> 06:48.860\nIt's like Netflix therapy.\n\n06:48.860 --> 06:50.860\nI don't know what that means.\n\n06:50.860 --> 06:52.860\nIt's just two buzzwords.\n\n06:52.860 --> 06:54.860\nTherapy's a buzzword.\n\n06:54.860 --> 06:56.860\nShut up!\n\n06:56.860 --> 07:00.860\nDreamworks Flagstones.\n\n07:00.860 --> 07:02.860\nApologies, Jeff.\n\n07:02.860 --> 07:04.860\nThey like a good story.\n\n07:04.860 --> 07:06.860\nDan, will you tell me about apology structure?\n\n07:06.860 --> 07:09.860\nThey have three parts to them.\n\n07:09.860 --> 07:12.860\nApologies have three legs. It's like a tripod.\n\n07:12.860 --> 07:16.860\nA proper apology, one that makes a difference historically.\n\n07:16.860 --> 07:18.860\nHis book is about the history of apologies.\n\n07:18.860 --> 07:20.860\nThe ones that worked.\n\n07:20.860 --> 07:22.860\nWhat's the most famous apology?\n\n07:22.860 --> 07:26.860\nOne of the most famous failed ones?\n\n07:26.860 --> 07:27.860\nNixon.\n\n07:27.860 --> 07:32.860\nNixon bothered to say, I'm really sorry if you guys feel like I'm a crook.\n\n07:32.860 --> 07:34.860\nSo typically, we've all done that apology.\n\n07:34.860 --> 07:36.860\nI'm sorry if you feel that way.\n\n07:36.860 --> 07:39.860\nIt's all on you. You're a fucking dumbass.\n\n07:39.860 --> 07:43.860\nI'm sorry if you have something wrong with you.\n\n07:43.860 --> 07:45.860\nI'm sorry I'm so impeachable.\n\n07:45.860 --> 07:50.860\nI can't remember a famous one that really made a huge difference.\n\n07:50.860 --> 07:54.860\nBut historically, politically, if you examine situations where a wrong has been done\n\n07:54.860 --> 08:00.860\nand then someone tries to address it, there are historically examples of times when it works,\n\n08:00.860 --> 08:02.860\ntimes when it doesn't work.\n\n08:02.860 --> 08:05.860\nIt's not scientific, but it's anecdotal.\n\n08:05.860 --> 08:11.860\nThis guy posits that an apology has three parts to it.\n\n08:11.860 --> 08:15.860\nPart one, acknowledgement of the offense.\n\n08:15.860 --> 08:18.860\nSo you say, Jeff, I'm sorry.\n\n08:18.860 --> 08:21.860\nI'm sorry, I spilled your water.\n\n08:21.860 --> 08:22.860\nOkay.\n\n08:22.860 --> 08:25.860\nYou don't have to applaud for each thing.\n\n08:25.860 --> 08:26.860\nThey didn't.\n\n08:26.860 --> 08:29.860\nStep two, one guy keeps crying.\n\n08:29.860 --> 08:32.860\nI don't know if there's a mosquito.\n\n08:32.860 --> 08:38.860\nIf he's trying to start the world's slowest, slow clap.\n\n08:38.860 --> 08:42.860\nThe second leg of the tripod is remorse.\n\n08:42.860 --> 08:44.860\nYou got to actually feel bad.\n\n08:44.860 --> 08:47.860\nYou got to actually communicate the shame that you feel,\n\n08:47.860 --> 08:49.860\nthe remorse you feel about the thing you did wrong.\n\n08:49.860 --> 08:51.860\nAnd the third thing, a commitment to change.\n\n08:51.860 --> 08:53.860\nOkay, so all three things.\n\n08:53.860 --> 08:55.860\nSo, Dan, let's say you spilled my water.\n\n08:55.860 --> 08:59.860\nAnd how would you apologize using that tripod?\n\n08:59.860 --> 09:01.860\nJeff, I'm sorry that I spilled your water.\n\n09:01.860 --> 09:04.860\nI feel terrible that I spilled your water.\n\n09:04.860 --> 09:06.860\nI'm never going to spill your water again.\n\n09:06.860 --> 09:12.860\nPerfect apology.\n\n09:12.860 --> 09:15.860\nNow, what if you're being asked in a relationship to apologize\n\n09:15.860 --> 09:21.860\nfor something that maybe you feel like it was a two-way street?\n\n09:21.860 --> 09:23.860\nWell, that's that you just take turns.\n\n09:23.860 --> 09:25.860\nI got Aaron.\n\n09:25.860 --> 09:28.860\nI'm sorry that I came drunk into the bedroom.\n\n09:28.860 --> 09:34.860\nNothing but my underwear holding my pot box that you filled with\n\n09:34.860 --> 09:38.860\ncharades paper from your party\n\n09:38.860 --> 09:42.860\nand having dumped out all my paraphernalia\n\n09:42.860 --> 09:48.860\nand brandished it about like a stone savage going,\n\n09:48.860 --> 09:52.860\nyou don't respect my property.\n\n09:52.860 --> 09:55.860\nI'm sorry I did that.\n\n09:55.860 --> 09:57.860\nI'm sorry I shamed you.\n\n09:57.860 --> 09:59.860\nI'm sorry I made you feel ashamed.\n\n09:59.860 --> 10:03.860\nI feel terrible about it because it makes me feel like I've become my dad.\n\n10:03.860 --> 10:06.860\nAnd you know what?\n\n10:06.860 --> 10:11.860\nI'm going to try to figure out a way to be drunk and accountable.\n\n10:11.860 --> 10:21.860\nAnd if that fails, then we'll have to start doing the hard stuff.\n\n10:21.860 --> 10:23.860\nWhat is that?\n\n10:23.860 --> 10:26.860\nWell, if I can't be a good person when I'm drunk,\n\n10:26.860 --> 10:29.860\nthen of course you've got to become one of those people.\n\n10:29.860 --> 10:32.860\nWait, what are you talking about?\n\n10:32.860 --> 10:40.860\nThe Jason Robards people, it's been 30 days and I'm so proud of myself people.\n\n10:40.860 --> 10:42.860\nSober.\n\n10:42.860 --> 10:47.860\nQuitters, yeah.\n\n10:47.860 --> 10:50.860\nI don't want to talk about it.\n\n10:50.860 --> 10:54.860\nLet's just hope I get my shit together while drunk.\n\n10:54.860 --> 10:59.860\nSo yeah, that's it.\n\n10:59.860 --> 11:03.860\nNow that would be the greatest thing in the world to be at the world's best drunk.\n\n11:03.860 --> 11:05.860\nIt's called functional alcoholism.\n\n11:05.860 --> 11:11.860\nI've got it nailed down in every aspect of my life except for when Aaron and I have a couple to do.\n\n11:11.860 --> 11:13.860\nWhen Aaron loses your weed?\n\n11:13.860 --> 11:16.860\nYeah, whenever.\n\n11:16.860 --> 11:18.860\nI mean, I don't know.\n\n11:18.860 --> 11:23.860\nI'm a bad person when I drink sometimes with my lovers.\n\n11:23.860 --> 11:25.860\nIt's not good.\n\n11:25.860 --> 11:35.860\nI have to carry it like a rabbit's foot or something and rub it and go like, knock it off, dad.\n\n11:35.860 --> 11:43.860\nOr like a locket with a picture of my dad in it, like open it up and go like, I'm not you, man.\n\n11:43.860 --> 11:50.860\nAnd then on the other side is a picture of my mom and I go like, why did you henpeck him so much?\n\n11:50.860 --> 11:53.860\nIt wasn't just the booze.\n\n11:53.860 --> 11:55.860\nI'm gonna close it.\n\n11:55.860 --> 11:58.860\nMaybe reacting like that for it doesn't make a lot of sense.\n\n11:58.860 --> 12:01.860\nBecause they're worried.\n\n12:01.860 --> 12:03.860\nAbout my parents?\n\n12:03.860 --> 12:05.860\nNo, about you.\n\n12:05.860 --> 12:10.860\nI'm 41, I mean, I'm gonna, you know, what?\n\n12:10.860 --> 12:12.860\nWell, exactly, what?\n\n12:12.860 --> 12:15.860\nI mean, what?\n\n12:15.860 --> 12:18.860\nI'm 41, what?\n\n12:18.860 --> 12:21.860\nAre you saying it's too late to adapt?\n\n12:21.860 --> 12:24.860\nI just finished explaining that I'm gonna try to make some changes.\n\n12:24.860 --> 12:26.860\nIt's a commitment to change.\n\n12:26.860 --> 12:31.860\nYou said you wished you had a rabbit's foot, that was on one side with your father,\n\n12:31.860 --> 12:35.860\nand the other side with your mother and you blamed her for your father being like he was.\n\n12:35.860 --> 12:38.860\nWell, they can't all be gems.\n\n12:38.860 --> 12:41.860\nAlso, I've been drinking a little.\n\n12:41.860 --> 12:48.860\nI suppose maybe that's why my commitment to change got a little warbly.\n\n12:48.860 --> 12:51.860\nSports Corner!\n\n12:57.860 --> 13:04.860\nIt's a world of sports and Dan Harmon, there's a fan of him all, all, all, all, all, all.\n\n13:04.860 --> 13:10.860\nDan, today the World Cup came to its beautiful climax.\n\n13:10.860 --> 13:12.860\nThe finals happened today.\n\n13:12.860 --> 13:17.860\nObviously, I would be at full to not know that.\n\n13:17.860 --> 13:22.860\nTop of your head, give me some, just throw some headlines at me for you.\n\n13:22.860 --> 13:30.860\nIt's all over, it's finally over, the World Cup only happens every once in a while.\n\n13:30.860 --> 13:34.860\nIt's, it's not annually.\n\n13:34.860 --> 13:37.860\nNo.\n\n13:37.860 --> 13:43.860\nFor those of you dumbasses who thought it was, this is a bigger deal, it's like the Olympics.\n\n13:43.860 --> 13:49.860\nWhat would you say, I mean, what year, in 2014, where we're living now,\n\n13:49.860 --> 13:53.860\nwhat year do you project the next World Cup with me?\n\n13:53.860 --> 13:59.860\nWell, it's not, I mean, it's like the Olympics.\n\n13:59.860 --> 14:02.860\nSo, four years from now.\n\n14:06.860 --> 14:11.860\nSo, I mean, and what an ending to what a World Cup.\n\n14:11.860 --> 14:16.860\nThis is the first time that I've ever said this about a World Cup.\n\n14:16.860 --> 14:20.860\nAnything you say right now would be the first time you said this about a World Cup.\n\n14:20.860 --> 14:25.860\nI'm gonna, I would call it a world mug.\n\n14:25.860 --> 14:27.860\nLike it was that good.\n\n14:27.860 --> 14:29.860\nBit, bit, bit, booming.\n\n14:29.860 --> 14:31.860\nYou mean bigger than a cup.\n\n14:31.860 --> 14:35.860\nYeah, like, and more intimate.\n\n14:35.860 --> 14:40.860\nProuder, something that said World's greatest grandpa World Cup on it.\n\n14:40.860 --> 14:43.860\nDo you feel the best team won today, Dan, in the finals?\n\n14:43.860 --> 14:48.860\nWell, I mean, obviously, Jeff, in the technical sense, the reason for the sports,\n\n14:48.860 --> 14:55.860\nvarious scorekeeping mechanisms is to determine who won, and who is therefore the best team.\n\n14:55.860 --> 14:58.860\nDo I feel the best team won?\n\n14:58.860 --> 15:02.860\nI mean, sometimes it can come down to penalty kicks, or it can come down to just defense,\n\n15:02.860 --> 15:04.860\nand people like, do you feel like...\n\n15:04.860 --> 15:07.860\nThat's all part of the sport, Jeff, all those things.\n\n15:07.860 --> 15:11.860\nI guess my question is, who won today, Dan?\n\n15:11.860 --> 15:21.860\nWell, I mean, we all know who won today, but I will say I was shocked that they did win.\n\n15:21.860 --> 15:22.860\nI was shocked that they won.\n\n15:22.860 --> 15:23.860\nWhy is that?\n\n15:23.860 --> 15:33.860\nWell, because you don't really associate that country with flat land,\n\n15:33.860 --> 15:41.860\nwhich soccer is on a flat field, and this is a very mountainous country.\n\n15:41.860 --> 15:43.860\nWhat kind of terrain?\n\n15:43.860 --> 15:49.860\nI mean, it's a large country that includes mountainous terrain.\n\n15:49.860 --> 15:50.860\nExactly.\n\n15:50.860 --> 15:54.860\nSo you'd expect them to be worse at soccer than the other team.\n\n15:54.860 --> 16:03.860\nNow, Dan, it's the first time a European team played and won a World Cup on American soil.\n\n16:03.860 --> 16:07.860\nYeah.\n\n16:07.860 --> 16:08.860\nI can't believe it.\n\n16:08.860 --> 16:10.860\nI can't believe...\n\n16:10.860 --> 16:14.860\nI can't believe Germany won.\n\n16:14.860 --> 16:15.860\nIs that a guess?\n\n16:15.860 --> 16:16.860\nYeah.\n\n16:16.860 --> 16:18.860\nYou're right.\n\n16:18.860 --> 16:22.860\nI'm a fucking sport head.\n\n16:22.860 --> 16:25.860\nDan, what do you mean is that a guess?\n\n16:25.860 --> 16:27.860\nWell, I'll follow up that question.\n\n16:27.860 --> 16:29.860\nWho did they beat?\n\n16:29.860 --> 16:31.860\nWell, they were on American soil.\n\n16:31.860 --> 16:32.860\nYes.\n\n16:32.860 --> 16:40.860\nAnd as we all know in soccer, you don't just play another team on another country's soil, right?\n\n16:40.860 --> 16:44.860\nIt's not like one country hosts for two other countries.\n\n16:44.860 --> 16:47.860\nBrazil was the host nation, but Brazil got knocked out by Germany.\n\n16:47.860 --> 16:57.860\nAnd ignominiously, they got killed in 7-1, the worst defeat, probably the most terrible feat in Brazil's World Cup history.\n\n16:57.860 --> 17:06.860\nSo another South American team lost today.\n\n17:06.860 --> 17:13.860\nAnd tell me why you think they lost, and tell me what color their flag is.\n\n17:13.860 --> 17:17.860\nLook, I...\n\n17:17.860 --> 17:19.860\nJust name some primary colors.\n\n17:19.860 --> 17:21.860\nI think their flag has green in it.\n\n17:21.860 --> 17:22.860\nNope.\n\n17:22.860 --> 17:25.860\nThat's not a primary color.\n\n17:25.860 --> 17:26.860\nPrimary...\n\n17:26.860 --> 17:30.860\nYou got a 1-3 chance just to start off.\n\n17:30.860 --> 17:31.860\nChile?\n\n17:31.860 --> 17:33.860\nNo.\n\n17:33.860 --> 17:38.860\nChile's not a primary color either.\n\n17:38.860 --> 17:42.860\nIt's not red or yellow.\n\n17:42.860 --> 17:44.860\nArgentina.\n\n17:44.860 --> 17:46.860\nYes!\n\n17:46.860 --> 17:52.860\nArgentina lost to Germany on American soil for the first time.\n\n17:52.860 --> 17:55.860\nThat's why it was a world mug.\n\n17:55.860 --> 17:56.860\nIncredible.\n\n17:56.860 --> 17:58.860\nI can't wait till 2018.\n\n17:58.860 --> 18:04.860\nNow, everyone go back to remembering that you're not interested in soccer at all.\n\n18:04.860 --> 18:11.860\nDan, what country do you think in four years' time will be the ascendant team that will shock us?\n\n18:11.860 --> 18:22.860\nWell, I think based on this quadra years' performances from all the teams, just observing,\n\n18:22.860 --> 18:28.860\nI felt like you're seeing a lot of foot action from France.\n\n18:28.860 --> 18:30.860\nOh yeah, times.\n\n18:30.860 --> 18:35.860\nThis is a country that knows about foot action.\n\n18:35.860 --> 18:45.860\nAnd I feel like they just didn't have the contiguous...\n\n18:45.860 --> 18:49.860\nYeah.\n\n18:49.860 --> 18:51.860\nSort of...\n\n18:51.860 --> 18:53.860\nSorry, what's that?\n\n18:53.860 --> 18:54.860\nContiguousness.\n\n18:54.860 --> 18:56.860\nContiguousness.\n\n18:56.860 --> 18:59.860\nYeah.\n\n18:59.860 --> 19:02.860\nBut I think that four years will be contiguous.\n\n19:02.860 --> 19:05.860\nCombine that with their foot action, I think France...\n\n19:05.860 --> 19:09.860\nThey'll be contiguous to other countries next to them, like Portugal or Spain?\n\n19:09.860 --> 19:12.860\nNo, their foot action will be contiguous with each other.\n\n19:12.860 --> 19:15.860\nLike when one guy kicks the ball, the other guy will start kicking it again, too.\n\n19:15.860 --> 19:18.860\nI don't think any of them will use their hands.\n\n19:18.860 --> 19:21.860\nWhat you saw from France this year is they're very good with their feet,\n\n19:21.860 --> 19:24.860\nbut then sometimes they use their hands and that's when they get into trouble.\n\n19:24.860 --> 19:26.860\nYou're not supposed to use your hands in soccer.\n\n19:26.860 --> 19:31.860\nDan, as I'm sure you know, famously a lot of European clubs\n\n19:31.860 --> 19:32.860\nwent out early.\n\n19:32.860 --> 19:36.860\nWe lost Portugal, England, Spain, France, Italy.\n\n19:36.860 --> 19:38.860\nThey went out quite early.\n\n19:38.860 --> 19:40.860\nWhat would you say...\n\n19:40.860 --> 19:45.860\nIf you were going to be the new coach, let's say, of England,\n\n19:45.860 --> 19:50.860\nwhat would you say to the youth teams that you're bringing up new talent?\n\n19:50.860 --> 19:53.860\nFirst of all, get out there.\n\n19:53.860 --> 19:55.860\nUse the grass.\n\n19:55.860 --> 19:58.860\nDon't fight the grass.\n\n19:58.860 --> 20:03.860\nNever stop running because the ball doesn't stop rolling.\n\n20:03.860 --> 20:12.860\nIf your teammate is open, they kick the ball to him and box out the other team.\n\n20:12.860 --> 20:17.860\nGet in those defense zones and then make them into offense zones\n\n20:17.860 --> 20:22.860\nby moving them forward and crouch on the goalie and get in the hot boxes\n\n20:22.860 --> 20:26.860\nand cross-tether.\n\n20:26.860 --> 20:28.860\nYeah, exactly.\n\n20:28.860 --> 20:32.860\nNow, Dan, when Germany ran over Brazil, the home nation,\n\n20:32.860 --> 20:38.860\nthey scored what, five goals in the first 30 minutes maybe or something like that?\n\n20:38.860 --> 20:41.860\nIt's 45 minutes in. It's 5-0.\n\n20:41.860 --> 20:44.860\nYou're Brazil's coach.\n\n20:44.860 --> 20:48.860\nYou're down five goals at halftime.\n\n20:48.860 --> 20:52.860\nWhat do you say to your team to rally them for the next 45 minutes\n\n20:52.860 --> 20:57.860\nand come out and turn it around or to at least salvage some sort of pride out of it?\n\n20:57.860 --> 21:00.860\nThis is it.\n\n21:00.860 --> 21:08.860\nThere's a bunch of dirt out there and we're not dirt.\n\n21:08.860 --> 21:10.860\nGod brought us up out of it.\n\n21:10.860 --> 21:15.860\nAm I the German coach?\n\n21:15.860 --> 21:18.860\nOkay, well, let's do both.\n\n21:18.860 --> 21:24.860\nGermany's winning by five goals. You want to be German's coach?\n\n21:24.860 --> 21:26.860\nYeah, I want to be the German coach.\n\n21:26.860 --> 21:31.860\nYou're up five goals to know and you're playing on Brazilian soil\n\n21:31.860 --> 21:38.860\nand the crowd that was filled with 100,000 Brazilian zealots is now gone completely silent.\n\n21:38.860 --> 21:41.860\nYou hear that sound?\n\n21:41.860 --> 21:49.860\nYou hear door-himmels? That means friend.\n\n21:49.860 --> 21:56.860\nThat's the sound of shame, our Teutonic legacy.\n\n21:56.860 --> 21:58.860\nWe're entitled to this.\n\n21:58.860 --> 22:07.860\nWe're entitled to a lot more than I'm not allowed to mention.\n\n22:07.860 --> 22:15.980\nAnd since receiving my new identity as a soccer coach, I have come to accept that we can gain\n\n22:15.980 --> 22:18.100\nterritory on that field.\n\n22:18.100 --> 22:23.900\nI want you guys to go out there and annex the whole game.\n\n22:23.900 --> 22:30.220\nYeah, okay, we're done with sports corner now.\n\n22:30.220 --> 22:43.260\nSorry, German Harmontown fans, German Harmontown fans, they're like, yeah, yeah, yeah, we get\n\n22:43.260 --> 22:44.260\nit.\n\n22:44.260 --> 22:45.260\nThey get it.\n\n22:45.260 --> 22:46.260\nEnough with the German jokes.\n\n22:46.260 --> 22:47.260\nWe get it.\n\n22:47.260 --> 22:48.260\nWe made it a oopsie.\n\n22:48.260 --> 22:54.540\nI mean, it was Germany versus Argentina and so there's a little complicity going on.\n\n22:54.540 --> 23:00.420\nYou know that that game was determined, yeah, in the back room, like based on extradition.\n\n23:00.420 --> 23:01.420\nBy Dr. Mengele?\n\n23:01.420 --> 23:07.420\nYeah, like, oh, yeah, there's like, well, we'll give you three clones of his head.\n\n23:07.420 --> 23:13.020\nWait, you think Argentina has Hitler's head cloned?\n\n23:13.020 --> 23:17.540\nI think a lot of places have Hitler's head cloned, bro.\n\n23:17.540 --> 23:22.620\nAnd you need to wake up and check your privilege.\n\n23:22.620 --> 23:27.180\nHashtag was up.\n\n23:27.180 --> 23:31.300\nI heard somebody say today, they're talking about Facebook being intrusive and Facebook,\n\n23:31.300 --> 23:33.940\nlike it's hard to delete your Facebook account.\n\n23:33.940 --> 23:37.380\nSomeone said that the CIA might have given lots of money to Facebook.\n\n23:37.380 --> 23:38.380\nIs there any credence in that?\n\n23:38.380 --> 23:39.380\nOr is that just crazy?\n\n23:39.380 --> 23:41.780\nWell, the NSA, I mean, you could go online.\n\n23:41.780 --> 23:42.780\nIt's fucking insane.\n\n23:42.780 --> 23:45.820\nThe NSA did everything, like no one cares.\n\n23:45.820 --> 23:47.620\nI don't care.\n\n23:47.620 --> 23:52.300\nLike the NSA was all over the fucking place, I'm sure it concludes Facebook.\n\n23:52.300 --> 23:53.300\nThey were funded?\n\n23:53.300 --> 23:54.300\nLike Facebook?\n\n23:54.300 --> 23:55.300\nWell, I don't know.\n\n23:55.300 --> 23:59.420\nFunded by, but they were absolutely complicit, like, I don't even, I mean, if somebody were\n\n23:59.420 --> 24:00.420\nto come up, then.\n\n24:00.420 --> 24:02.420\nDoes anybody have any thoughts?\n\n24:02.420 --> 24:06.700\nIt would turn into, I mean, we're talking about 25 minutes of somebody.\n\n24:06.700 --> 24:14.860\nThat's how long it would take to finish listing the NSA's transgressions against its domestic\n\n24:14.860 --> 24:20.580\ncitizens in the last 10 years, which have all come to light, thanks to a guy who's,\n\n24:20.580 --> 24:22.580\nyou know, some people view as a traitor.\n\n24:22.580 --> 24:27.260\nOn Saturday and Sunday on CNN, now they just air forensic files.\n\n24:27.260 --> 24:30.140\nNow they become like the history channel.\n\n24:30.140 --> 24:34.860\nAnd they just air forensic files where a guy goes, a woman was murdered and there was\n\n24:34.860 --> 24:38.780\nonly a Q-tip on the ground.\n\n24:38.780 --> 24:46.420\nWould 10 years from now, would there be science to find out who her murderer was?\n\n24:46.420 --> 24:51.980\nThe answer is yes, otherwise, no, there's going to be shows where they're going to find\n\n24:51.980 --> 24:56.420\nout there's a picture of a guy in the background and facial recognition of a dude in a Facebook\n\n24:56.420 --> 24:57.420\nsite.\n\n24:57.420 --> 24:59.980\nOh yeah, absolutely, because they've been storing this shit.\n\n24:59.980 --> 25:03.740\nThe weird thing about the whistleblowing is that it's like this big brew-ha-ha, oh, you\n\n25:03.740 --> 25:08.100\nblew the whistle, you told on us for spying on American citizens, but nothing has changed.\n\n25:08.100 --> 25:13.220\nAnd then also, now that the whistle's blown exactly 10 years from now, that stuff's all\n\n25:13.220 --> 25:19.340\nadmissible if, I mean, as long as you're kind of sort of connected to the concept of maybe\n\n25:19.340 --> 25:25.140\nthe threat of perhaps being something to do with terrorism by someone's definition, 10\n\n25:25.140 --> 25:28.420\nyears from now, let's not talk about it.\n\n25:28.420 --> 25:32.780\nThere's going to be nine other podcasts all around us that do nothing but talk about it.\n\n25:32.780 --> 25:33.780\nI hope so.\n\n25:33.780 --> 25:34.780\nI don't know.\n\n25:34.780 --> 25:40.780\nYou know, they were, they fucking, are you saying our podcast isn't a trenchant political\n\n25:40.780 --> 25:41.780\npodcast?\n\n25:41.780 --> 25:44.660\nIt's certainly not well researched to me, yeah.\n\n25:44.660 --> 25:48.140\nLike, there's got to be a good podcast out there where somebody that does their homework\n\n25:48.140 --> 25:50.740\nand like, we'll talk about this stuff and I think everybody's not...\n\n25:50.740 --> 25:51.740\nNo, there's true.\n\n25:51.740 --> 25:52.740\nThere's not.\n\n25:52.740 --> 25:57.220\nI certainly, I certainly, like, my, my excuses work, like, ah, it was right in community.\n\n25:57.220 --> 25:58.620\nI like to make the nice people laugh.\n\n25:58.620 --> 26:01.460\nI don't know anything about them looking at us through our laptop cameras.\n\n26:01.460 --> 26:03.100\nNow you, you work for Yahoo now.\n\n26:03.100 --> 26:04.100\nYeah.\n\n26:04.100 --> 26:06.460\nSo when does that go on to production?\n\n26:06.460 --> 26:08.020\nI have to check with the CIA.\n\n26:08.020 --> 26:09.020\nI don't know.\n\n26:09.020 --> 26:10.020\nThe CIA?\n\n26:10.020 --> 26:12.900\nWell, there's a different structure over there now.\n\n26:12.900 --> 26:14.100\nYeah.\n\n26:14.100 --> 26:18.700\nI have to go through the industrial complex and then the military complex and then there's\n\n26:18.700 --> 26:20.940\nthis third thing that's like a combination of them both.\n\n26:20.940 --> 26:24.140\nI can't remember the name.\n\n26:24.140 --> 26:26.460\nAnd then the funding comes through.\n\n26:26.460 --> 26:31.380\nThe checks are from Yahoo, but, but the notes come from the secretary of agriculture for\n\n26:31.380 --> 26:34.020\nsome reason.\n\n26:34.020 --> 26:37.940\nSo there's a lot of like, couldn't there be more wheat in this?\n\n26:37.940 --> 26:41.700\nDo you know how many episodes you're supposed to deliver?\n\n26:41.700 --> 26:42.700\nUh, 30.\n\n26:42.700 --> 26:44.300\nNo, no, we're going to make it.\n\n26:44.300 --> 26:45.300\nYeah.\n\n26:45.300 --> 26:46.300\n13, 13.\n\n26:46.300 --> 26:47.300\n13.\n\n26:47.300 --> 26:48.300\nIs it the same time structure?\n\n26:48.300 --> 26:49.300\nLike the same?\n\n26:49.300 --> 26:50.300\nYeah.\n\n26:50.300 --> 26:51.300\nAs far as I know.\n\n26:51.300 --> 26:52.300\nYeah.\n\n26:52.300 --> 26:53.300\nI don't want too much change about it.\n\n26:53.300 --> 26:56.380\nI don't want it to be like, bloated out or shrunken down.\n\n26:56.380 --> 26:58.460\nI want it to feel relatively the same.\n\n26:58.460 --> 27:00.220\nSo that's what she said.\n\n27:00.220 --> 27:01.220\nThat's what she said.\n\n27:01.220 --> 27:02.220\nThank you, Adam.\n\n27:02.220 --> 27:03.220\nAll right.\n\n27:03.220 --> 27:11.060\nWell, let's, we've got, we've got an exciting evening in store for you.\n\n27:11.060 --> 27:12.060\nThat was...\n\n27:12.060 --> 27:13.060\nKamell Masyani is not here tonight.\n\n27:13.060 --> 27:14.060\nYeah.\n\n27:14.060 --> 27:15.060\nDid you hear that?\n\n27:15.060 --> 27:20.460\nKamell, they applaud her when you weren't here because he is listening.\n\n27:20.460 --> 27:22.740\nHe's not egotistical.\n\n27:22.740 --> 27:23.740\nHe's busy.\n\n27:23.740 --> 27:24.740\nHe's too busy.\n\n27:24.740 --> 27:29.900\nHe's probably in some movie called like, you've got Kamell.\n\n27:29.900 --> 27:34.900\nHe wishes.\n\n27:34.900 --> 27:35.900\nHe wishes.\n\n27:35.900 --> 27:38.420\nI hope, I hope my stutter made it clear.\n\n27:38.420 --> 27:39.420\nI did not approve of that.\n\n27:39.420 --> 27:45.220\nAs it came out of my mouth, that was my thumbs down on my own dumb pun.\n\n27:45.220 --> 27:52.620\nLet's, let's, let's bring to the stage the lovely crimson haired phoenix of the deep\n\n27:52.620 --> 28:16.300\nKamell Masyani, Erin McAfee, hello, Phoenix of the deep, I don't know, I rise, but not,\n\n28:16.300 --> 28:17.300\nnot that far.\n\n28:17.300 --> 28:18.300\nShe rises.\n\n28:18.300 --> 28:20.300\nShe rises and then drowns.\n\n28:20.300 --> 28:28.460\nI only know that I'm a phoenix, everyone else is like, she died in that hole.\n\n28:28.460 --> 28:36.020\nI was trying to think of Fomke Johnson's X-Men character coming out of the ocean, I whittled\n\n28:36.020 --> 28:41.220\ntogether Phoenix of the deep, my brain's dying, and I'll get a, I'm going to get a\n\n28:41.220 --> 28:43.540\nCAT scan of my chest so we can find out if my body's dying.\n\n28:43.540 --> 28:48.100\nDan, give me a three pronged apology about Phoenix of the deep.\n\n28:48.100 --> 28:52.900\nI'm sorry I did bad improv as your introduction.\n\n28:52.900 --> 28:57.540\nIt makes me feel like a hack and like I'm disintegrating in front of your eyes.\n\n28:57.540 --> 28:59.740\nYou haven't even married me yet.\n\n28:59.740 --> 29:02.980\nI'm going to try through a combination of-\n\n29:02.980 --> 29:04.380\nWas that your remorse?\n\n29:04.380 --> 29:07.020\nThat was my remorse, yeah.\n\n29:07.020 --> 29:11.900\nMy commitment to change is that I'm hoping that somehow a combination of Rogaine and\n\n29:11.900 --> 29:18.660\na new car will help change me to a younger, smarter man.\n\n29:18.660 --> 29:20.660\nPossibly a tiny tattoo.\n\n29:20.660 --> 29:27.940\nLike maybe a yin-yang on a, Dan, if you had to, if you were a forest gun to your head,\n\n29:27.940 --> 29:29.980\nyou had to get a tattoo tonight, right?\n\n29:29.980 --> 29:37.220\nI walk you just two blocks down to get a tattoo and you have to shoot from the hip.\n\n29:37.220 --> 29:39.980\nWhat tattoo do you get, where do you put it on your body?\n\n29:39.980 --> 29:47.980\nAll right, I'll limit it to a two or a three inch by three inch square, like size.\n\n29:47.980 --> 29:51.420\nAll right, well, that's going to go in my chest.\n\n29:51.420 --> 29:59.540\nIt'll be Pac-Man from the video game, eating dots and then the dots lead to the word establishment.\n\n29:59.540 --> 30:10.540\nWhich either means the establishment gives you power.\n\n30:10.540 --> 30:15.620\nNow, Dan, my follow-up question to that is, how much money do you want me to give you\n\n30:15.620 --> 30:16.620\nto make that happen tonight?\n\n30:16.620 --> 30:19.620\nI will never get a tattoo.\n\n30:19.620 --> 30:20.620\nAnd I'm not joking.\n\n30:20.620 --> 30:26.300\nWhat is your outside number for us walking down to the tattoo parlor and you getting\n\n30:26.300 --> 30:27.300\nthat done?\n\n30:27.300 --> 30:29.540\nI think I said yes to the Yahoo deal.\n\n30:29.540 --> 30:34.740\nI'm never going to need money again.\n\n30:34.740 --> 30:36.380\nWhat would it take to make that happen?\n\n30:36.380 --> 30:39.860\nI swear there's no idea that it certainly is.\n\n30:39.860 --> 30:44.540\nMaybe, but I'm not committing to this, but not money, but possibly it would have to be\n\n30:44.540 --> 30:46.740\nsomething like you getting an even worse tattoo.\n\n30:46.740 --> 30:52.100\nWhat would that tattoo be?\n\n30:52.100 --> 30:55.100\nAdam Goldberg gets to pick what your tattoo is.\n\n30:55.100 --> 30:58.420\nAdam Goldberg, come to the stage and give me a worse tattoo, but I'm not committing to\n\n30:58.420 --> 31:02.420\nany of this.\n\n31:02.420 --> 31:07.780\nAdam Goldberg, if Dan gets the Pac-Man, you're talking about the Pac-Man with the legs and\n\n31:07.780 --> 31:08.780\narms?\n\n31:08.780 --> 31:14.940\nNo, no, not the, not Paci, the guy from the TV show.\n\n31:14.940 --> 31:15.940\nNo, no.\n\n31:15.940 --> 31:16.940\nThey called him Pac-Man.\n\n31:16.940 --> 31:22.780\nSo you're talking about Pac-Man, just the proper circle with the wedge out of it.\n\n31:22.780 --> 31:23.780\nYeah.\n\n31:23.780 --> 31:28.620\nI'm eating power of pellets that said establishment next to it.\n\n31:28.620 --> 31:29.620\nYep.\n\n31:29.620 --> 31:30.620\nOkay.\n\n31:30.620 --> 31:42.620\nAdam, pitch me what I would get in a, probably just the community season four logo.\n\n31:42.620 --> 31:44.620\nJust right on the forehead.\n\n31:44.620 --> 31:47.380\nAnd it's on the forehead?\n\n31:47.380 --> 31:51.940\nAnd it's Wayne Brady saying, I didn't mind it with the word blue and community season\n\n31:51.940 --> 31:53.940\nfour logo.\n\n31:53.940 --> 32:05.260\nAdam Goldberg everybody, Adam Goldberg.\n\n32:05.260 --> 32:09.060\nI would never get a tattoo.\n\n32:09.060 --> 32:10.820\nI wouldn't either.\n\n32:10.820 --> 32:17.460\nI would only get a tattoo of a racial epithet written backwards in black light on my head.\n\n32:17.460 --> 32:20.980\nThey invented black light tattoo ink and it says something terrible.\n\n32:20.980 --> 32:27.300\nAnd only if you went to a club and they said, let's go to the tattoo shop.\n\n32:27.300 --> 32:31.380\nWhy do you want it backwards so you can deny, you can plausibly say, so I can see it in\n\n32:31.380 --> 32:35.780\nthe mirror and remind myself that you're racist.\n\n32:35.780 --> 32:37.780\nI would never get a tattoo.\n\n32:37.780 --> 32:43.060\nIf I did get a tattoo, I think I would get on my chest, I would get the diagram of CPR\n\n32:43.060 --> 32:44.060\ninstructions.\n\n32:44.060 --> 32:47.980\nI like two spots where the paddles go.\n\n32:47.980 --> 32:52.860\nOr did I dump my arms and legs, really good recipes.\n\n32:52.860 --> 32:58.300\nLike, Jeff, how do you make really good buttermilk biscuits?\n\n32:58.300 --> 33:00.140\nWell, that's funny, you should ask.\n\n33:00.140 --> 33:05.980\nBut what do you do when someone's like, ah, you should add cinnamon?\n\n33:05.980 --> 33:09.460\nLike, you try something one day and you're like, this changes the whole thing.\n\n33:09.460 --> 33:11.500\nThen I show you my other tattoo, which has...\n\n33:11.500 --> 33:12.500\nAsterisks.\n\n33:12.500 --> 33:17.660\nNo, I'm too OCD to get a tattoo.\n\n33:17.660 --> 33:21.580\nIf I had a tattoo on one arm, I would feel that that arm weighed more than the other\n\n33:21.580 --> 33:22.580\narm.\n\n33:22.580 --> 33:27.660\nI wouldn't mind getting a tattoo of hair on the top of my head.\n\n33:27.660 --> 33:29.740\nAre you losing your hair?\n\n33:29.740 --> 33:32.540\nWell, I feel like I've always been a little thin.\n\n33:32.540 --> 33:33.540\nMy hair's very fine.\n\n33:33.540 --> 33:42.220\nI'm 41, so what did I think I was going to look like Hugh Grant forever?\n\n33:42.220 --> 33:43.500\nHe's losing his hair too.\n\n33:43.500 --> 33:45.260\nWell, he's older than me.\n\n33:45.260 --> 33:48.140\nI mean, Hugh Grant from the movies we've been watching all week.\n\n33:48.140 --> 33:51.260\nI had a bit of a Grant Thon.\n\n33:51.260 --> 33:52.940\nA Grant Thon?\n\n33:52.940 --> 33:53.940\nYeah.\n\n33:53.940 --> 33:57.940\nI just noticed that if I ever see myself on video or in a picture, when my head goes\n\n33:57.940 --> 34:05.100\ndown and there's light coming at it, like, I'd see nothing but scalp of concern to me.\n\n34:05.100 --> 34:12.460\nAlso, where I do see a lot of hair, the old comb, I don't comb my hair a lot, so I don't\n\n34:12.460 --> 34:16.700\nknow if the reason why when I do, like, oh, that's a lot of hair.\n\n34:16.700 --> 34:19.980\nI don't know if that's just because I don't comb my hair enough or...\n\n34:19.980 --> 34:22.380\nMaybe it's because you have too much hair.\n\n34:22.380 --> 34:23.380\nYeah.\n\n34:23.380 --> 34:29.820\nYour hair's like, this isn't fair to Phoenix of the Deep.\n\n34:29.820 --> 34:34.380\nHey, it looks like it's time for Game Corner.\n\n34:34.380 --> 34:36.380\nLet's go.\n\n34:36.380 --> 34:44.700\nThere's a lot of corners to this show.\n\n34:44.700 --> 34:45.700\nThere are a lot of corners.\n\n34:45.700 --> 34:47.540\nWell, there's two corners to the show.\n\n34:47.540 --> 34:51.580\nWell, I named both of the corners.\n\n34:51.580 --> 34:53.740\nThat's why I'm not creative, I guess.\n\n34:53.740 --> 34:55.740\nIt's all the same.\n\n34:55.740 --> 34:56.740\nEw.\n\n34:56.740 --> 34:58.740\nThat's not a fun fact.\n\n34:58.740 --> 34:59.740\nWhat?\n\n34:59.740 --> 35:01.380\nThat's not a fun fact.\n\n35:01.380 --> 35:02.380\nNo, it's not.\n\n35:02.380 --> 35:03.380\nIt's...\n\n35:03.380 --> 35:04.380\nAll right.\n\n35:04.380 --> 35:11.380\nCan I have, I need two volunteers for this game, people that maybe have never been on\n\n35:11.380 --> 35:12.380\nstage before.\n\n35:12.380 --> 35:14.060\nYou right here, and you right here.\n\n35:14.060 --> 35:15.380\nOh, you've been on stage?\n\n35:15.380 --> 35:16.380\nMia.\n\n35:16.380 --> 35:18.380\nI've never been on stage.\n\n35:18.380 --> 35:19.380\nYou've never been on stage.\n\n35:19.380 --> 35:20.380\nOkay, come on stage.\n\n35:20.380 --> 35:21.380\nWhat is your name?\n\n35:21.380 --> 35:22.380\nOran.\n\n35:22.380 --> 35:23.380\nOran.\n\n35:23.380 --> 35:24.380\nOran.\n\n35:24.380 --> 35:25.380\nOran.\n\n35:25.380 --> 35:26.380\nOran.\n\n35:26.380 --> 35:27.380\nOran.\n\n35:27.380 --> 35:28.380\nOran.\n\n35:28.380 --> 35:29.380\nAnd this is Morgan.\n\n35:29.380 --> 35:30.380\nMorgan and Oran.\n\n35:30.380 --> 35:31.380\nHi.\n\n35:31.380 --> 35:32.380\nWelcome.\n\n35:32.380 --> 35:34.380\nHi.\n\n35:34.380 --> 35:42.380\nWe're going to play...we're going to revisit Harmonized Impressions.\n\n35:42.380 --> 35:43.380\nYay!\n\n35:43.380 --> 35:44.380\nThank you.\n\n35:44.380 --> 35:45.380\nThere we go.\n\n35:45.380 --> 35:47.380\nIt's a mixed reaction.\n\n35:47.380 --> 35:52.380\nAnd the crowd goes mild.\n\n35:52.380 --> 35:58.380\nI think it was a good showmanship for me to say it as I'm doing stuff and it makes me\n\n35:58.380 --> 35:59.380\nfeel a little ashamed.\n\n35:59.380 --> 36:01.380\nNow do it like an impresario.\n\n36:01.380 --> 36:02.380\nAll right.\n\n36:02.380 --> 36:07.380\nTonight, your lives will change.\n\n36:07.380 --> 36:13.380\nYour children will ask you about the day that you witnessed the second coming of Harmonized\n\n36:13.380 --> 36:14.380\nImpressions.\n\n36:14.380 --> 36:30.380\nTonight, on Harmonized Impressions, we have Oran, green shirt enthusiast from Masquerado.\n\n36:30.380 --> 36:35.380\nAnd we also have Morgan, who probably played the guitar at some point.\n\n36:35.380 --> 36:36.380\nNo.\n\n36:36.380 --> 36:37.380\nOkay.\n\n36:37.380 --> 36:41.380\nShe looks like she plays the guitar.\n\n36:41.380 --> 36:43.380\nAll right.\n\n36:43.380 --> 36:45.380\nNow the game is very simple.\n\n36:45.380 --> 36:50.380\nYou're like the Silver Lake Don Rickles.\n\n36:50.380 --> 36:53.380\nPlease try my homemade beer in the back of the room.\n\n36:53.380 --> 36:54.380\nAll right.\n\n36:54.380 --> 36:55.380\nSilver Lake Joe.\n\n36:55.380 --> 36:56.380\nOkay.\n\n36:56.380 --> 37:01.380\nAll right, so for this game, Dan is going to perform Impressions.\n\n37:01.380 --> 37:04.380\nAnd you guys are going to be guessing what Impression he's doing.\n\n37:04.380 --> 37:08.380\nDuring the game, you both have a Jeff card.\n\n37:08.380 --> 37:14.380\nSo you have one opportunity during the course of the game to flag your Jeff card after Dan\n\n37:14.380 --> 37:19.380\nperforms an Impression, if it's maybe an Impression that you need a little more help on.\n\n37:19.380 --> 37:20.380\nAll right.\n\n37:20.380 --> 37:22.380\nAnd then Jeff will do the same Impression.\n\n37:22.380 --> 37:23.380\nWait.\n\n37:23.380 --> 37:25.380\nI have to help do it?\n\n37:25.380 --> 37:28.380\nIf they use their Jeff card.\n\n37:28.380 --> 37:30.380\nIt'll make sense when it happens.\n\n37:30.380 --> 37:31.380\nYes, one time use.\n\n37:31.380 --> 37:32.380\nTake a wild card.\n\n37:32.380 --> 37:33.380\nGrab this.\n\n37:33.380 --> 37:34.380\nPen.\n\n37:34.380 --> 37:35.380\nAll right.\n\n37:35.380 --> 37:39.380\nFor the listeners, I'm doing this seamlessly.\n\n37:39.380 --> 37:41.380\nAll right.\n\n37:41.380 --> 37:45.380\nDan, here are your Impressions.\n\n37:45.380 --> 37:46.380\nOkay.\n\n37:46.380 --> 37:54.380\nNow to start the game, you're both going to do a very quick Impression.\n\n37:54.380 --> 37:55.380\nReal quick.\n\n37:55.380 --> 38:00.380\nAre these Impressions that you've heard Dan do before or not?\n\n38:00.380 --> 38:01.380\nNo.\n\n38:01.380 --> 38:02.380\nNo.\n\n38:02.380 --> 38:05.380\nSome of them he has, some of them he hasn't.\n\n38:05.380 --> 38:08.380\nThese are wild cards as far as Dan is concerned.\n\n38:08.380 --> 38:09.380\nThese are wild cards.\n\n38:09.380 --> 38:15.380\nI can see what he's looking on Dan's face right now, that he's flummoxed.\n\n38:15.380 --> 38:19.380\nA better word is bummed out.\n\n38:19.380 --> 38:24.380\nShe said in the Uber on the way over, what phrase did you use?\n\n38:24.380 --> 38:26.380\nI was going to gift you more.\n\n38:26.380 --> 38:30.380\nYeah, you were going to throw me some gifts tonight.\n\n38:30.380 --> 38:31.380\nAll right.\n\n38:31.380 --> 38:32.380\nHere we go.\n\n38:32.380 --> 38:34.380\nHow does the game work?\n\n38:34.380 --> 38:35.380\nAll right.\n\n38:35.380 --> 38:39.380\nSo we're going to start the game with each of you doing your best Dan Impression.\n\n38:39.380 --> 38:40.380\nAnd I'm going to be the judge.\n\n38:40.380 --> 38:42.380\nSo take that into account.\n\n38:42.380 --> 38:44.380\nAre we a team?\n\n38:44.380 --> 38:45.380\nYou're not a team.\n\n38:45.380 --> 38:47.380\nYou're going out against each other.\n\n38:47.380 --> 38:48.380\nYou're mortal opponents.\n\n38:48.380 --> 38:49.380\nJeff is going to keep score.\n\n38:49.380 --> 38:51.380\nIt'll make sense as we go on.\n\n38:51.380 --> 38:54.380\nAll right, Oran, your best Dan Impression.\n\n38:54.380 --> 38:56.380\nWell, the government.\n\n38:56.380

--> 42:01.380\nI was right.\n\n42:01.380 --> 42:06.380\nIt's a good particle.\n\n42:06.380 --> 42:08.380\nIs he from Australia?\n\n42:08.380 --> 42:09.380\nYes, he's Australia.\n\n42:09.380 --> 42:10.380\nNo, it's not.\n\n42:10.380 --> 42:16.380\nIt's not supposed to be.\n\n42:16.380 --> 42:22.380\nI think it's called the Gibson Hughes particle.\n\n42:22.380 --> 42:26.380\nI can't stop

talk about your different\n\n01:03:15.940 --> 01:03:17.940\nmodifications they made here.\n\n01:03:17.940 --> 01:03:18.940\nIs it open still?\n\n01:03:18.940 --> 01:03:19.940\nProbably.\n\n01:03:19.940 --> 01:03:23.940\nIs that like an uptick off of like a hookah place?\n\n01:03:23.940 --> 01:03:24.940\nYeah.\n\n01:03:24.940 --> 01:03:25.940\nNow you just

I don't know what's successful and what's not.\n\n01:03:34.940 --> 01:03:35.940\nI can't predict success.\n\n01:03:35.940 --> 01:03:38.940\nSpencer, can I hear your Woody Harrelson impression?\n\n01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:44.940\nHey, man.\n\n01:03:44.940 --> 01:03:45.940\nRight.\n\n01:03:45.940 --> 01:03:47.940\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:03:47.940 --> 01:03:50.940\nIt's not bad, right?\n\n01:03:50.940 --> 01:03:52.940\nHe has an oxygen bar?\n\n01:03:52.940 --> 01:03:54.940\nHe used to, but it shut down.\n\n01:03:54.940 --> 01:04:00.940\nMan, I saw one of those in Orange County fucking got a bunch of jars of air.\n\n01:04:00.940 --> 01:04:03.940\nIt just doesn't seem like it's like pinkberry.\n\n01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:04.940\nOkay.\n\n01:04:04.940 --> 01:04:08.940\nIf you told me, you know, like, like, okay, hey, who would have known that like just a\n\n01:04:08.940 --> 01:04:11.940\ndifferent kind of frozen yogurt or whatever would would take off?\n\n01:04:11.940 --> 01:04:13.940\nLike I wouldn't, I wouldn't be like, who would have thought?\n\n01:04:13.940 --> 01:04:14.940\nYeah.\n\n01:04:14.940 --> 01:04:20.940\nBut like I would definitely not predict vapor or oxygen being like a new thing.\n\n01:04:20.940 --> 01:04:23.940\nI mean, I can't imagine that those places are doing that.\n\n01:04:23.940 --> 01:04:28.940\nI'm going to say vapor places go the way as a dodo like oxygen bars did too.\n\n01:04:28.940 --> 01:04:29.940\nYeah.\n\n01:04:29.940 --> 01:04:30.940\nI really hope so.\n\n01:04:30.940 --> 01:04:31.940\nYeah.\n\n01:04:31.940 -->

we all kind of predicted that success.\n\n01:04:36.940 --> 01:04:37.940\nMake a good donut.\n\n01:04:37.940 --> 01:04:38.940\nYeah.\n\n01:04:38.940 --> 01:04:41.940\nOr just one that's really bad for you.\n\n01:04:41.940 --> 01:04:47.940\nLike every year I do a gig at the MGM Grand Casino in Vegas and there's an oxygen place\n\n01:04:47.940 --> 01:04:50.940\nand people sit down and you strap on a bunch of oxygen into your face.\n\n01:04:50.940 --> 01:04:53.940\nIt looks like a bummer.\n\n01:04:53.940 --> 01:04:58.940\nWell, in Vegas that might, I mean, yeah, maybe you might, you might actually need oxygen\n\n01:04:58.940 --> 01:04:59.940\nin Vegas.\n\n01:04:59.940 --> 01:05:03.940\nBut they, but they hyper oxygenate the casinos.\n\n01:05:03.940 --> 01:05:05.940\nIt's supposed to be good for hangovers, right?\n\n01:05:05.940 --> 01:05:06.940\nYeah.\n\n01:05:06.940 --> 01:05:08.940\nDon't they also put an IV drip on you when they do that?\n\n01:05:08.940 --> 01:05:13.940\nThey have mobile hangover vans that they, where they give you saline.\n\n01:05:13.940 --> 01:05:17.940\nThey have those in China, but they just kill you.\n\n01:05:17.940 --> 01:05:20.940\nI think you're thinking of Soylent Green.\n\n01:05:20.940 --> 01:05:23.940\nIt's still fictional as of yet.\n\n01:05:23.940 --> 01:05:26.940\nAs of press time, China hasn't gone to Soylent Green yet.\n\n01:05:26.940 --> 01:05:28.940\nMurder vans though.\n\n01:05:28.940 --> 01:05:30.940\nDid they just murder vans in China?\n\n01:05:30.940 --> 01:05:31.940\nThey don't.\n\n01:05:31.940 --> 01:05:32.940\nOh yeah.\n\n01:05:32.940 --> 01:05:33.940\nDid you, what, what?\n\n01:05:33.940 --> 01:05:34.940\nAll right, tell us.\n\n01:05:34.940 --> 01:05:35.940\nCome on.\n\n01:05:35.940 --> 01:05:38.940\nThere's just like these vans full of Chinese officials that are just waiting to grab people,\n\n01:05:38.940 --> 01:05:40.940\npull them in and just put them to sleep.\n\n01:05:40.940 --> 01:05:41.940\nFor what?\n\n01:05:41.940 --> 01:05:44.940\nFor being Chinese, man.\n\n01:05:44.940 --> 01:05:45.940\nWait.\n\n01:05:45.940 --> 01:05:47.940\nHow do you know when you're finished?\n\n01:05:47.940 --> 01:05:49.940\nWell, you never are.\n\n01:05:49.940 --> 01:05:50.940\nThat's the thing.\n\n01:05:50.940 --> 01:05:54.940\nI mean, they kill you, but not two hours after you want to be killed again.\n\n01:05:54.940 --> 01:05:56.940\nThat is such a...\n\n01:05:56.940 --> 01:05:57.940\nWhat?\n\n01:05:57.940 --> 01:05:58.940\nWhat?\n\n01:05:58.940 --> 01:06:01.940\nWhat are you talking about?\n\n01:06:01.940 --> 01:06:05.940\nSomeone deflated in the audience.\n\n01:06:05.940 --> 01:06:07.940\nChinese murder vans.\n\n01:06:07.940 --> 01:06:08.940\nWait.\n\n01:06:08.940 --> 01:06:11.940\nCome on, explicate.\n\n01:06:11.940 --> 01:06:14.940\nThat's one of those things that I know, but I don't know why I know.\n\n01:06:14.940 --> 01:06:16.940\nThat's all the information I have on that.\n\n01:06:16.940 --> 01:06:21.940\nI want you to just freestyle and tell me what a Chinese murder van is about.\n\n01:06:21.940 --> 01:06:24.940\nI mean, did I not say?\n\n01:06:24.940 --> 01:06:28.940\nYou say there are roving vans that will just kill you for being Chinese?\n\n01:06:28.940 --> 01:06:29.940\nWell, yeah.\n\n01:06:29.940 --> 01:06:31.940\nNo, not for being Chinese.\n\n01:06:31.940 --> 01:06:35.940\nThey're like enemy people, like people the government needs disappeared, you know?\n\n01:06:35.940 --> 01:06:38.940\nSo a van pulls up, like, hey, you seem like a cool guy.\n\n01:06:38.940 --> 01:06:41.940\nNo, it's more violent than that.\n\n01:06:41.940 --> 01:06:43.940\nJust grab you.\n\n01:06:43.940 --> 01:06:46.940\nDid they grab you, put you in a van, and just fucking...\n\n01:06:46.940 --> 01:06:49.940\nAnd why use saline?\n\n01:06:49.940 --> 01:06:50.940\nThat seems so...\n\n01:06:50.940 --> 01:06:51.940\nNo, they don't.\n\n01:06:51.940 --> 01:06:55.940\nInstead of saline, it's more like poison juice.\n\n01:06:55.940 --> 01:06:57.940\nPoison juice?\n\n01:06:57.940 --> 01:06:58.940\nYeah.\n\n01:06:58.940 --> 01:06:59.940\nWhat do they call it?\n\n01:06:59.940 --> 01:07:00.940\nMSG.\n\n01:07:00.940 --> 01:07:02.940\nKool-Aid.\n\n01:07:02.940 --> 01:07:10.940\nSo if you're an enemy of the Chinese state, a van pulls up, and they go, hey, they coerce you,\n\n01:07:10.940 --> 01:07:12.940\nor they just strong arm you and pull you in the van.\n\n01:07:12.940 --> 01:07:14.940\nYeah, that's what I'm alleging.\n\n01:07:14.940 --> 01:07:16.940\nAnd then...\n\n01:07:22.940 --> 01:07:26.940\nDidn't China soften their policy on...\n\n01:07:26.940 --> 01:07:28.940\nFire drills?\n\n01:07:28.940 --> 01:07:33.940\nRecently, like, they don't need them to happen at every intersection now.\n\n01:07:33.940 --> 01:07:36.940\nBecause they did some research and they're totally inefficient.\n\n01:07:36.940 --> 01:07:39.940\nThey actually, like, put a tracking device on everybody.\n\n01:07:39.940 --> 01:07:44.940\nAnd for a Chinese fire drill, like, actually, it's no safer than just having no fire drill at all.\n\n01:07:44.940 --> 01:07:47.940\nIt turns out you should just run away from the fire.\n\n01:07:47.940 --> 01:07:50.940\nSomebody's handing you research, I think.\n\n01:07:50.940 --> 01:07:52.940\nThat's one of our...\n\n01:07:52.940 --> 01:07:55.940\nOr maybe it's the definition of racism.\n\n01:07:55.940 --> 01:08:02.940\nAmnesty International is handing you an affidavit.\n\n01:08:02.940 --> 01:08:07.940\nI've been handed a phone that says, the execution van, also called a mobile execution unit,\n\n01:08:07.940 --> 01:08:12.940\nwas developed by the government of the People's Republic of China, and was first used in 1997.\n\n01:08:12.940 --> 01:08:16.940\nThere's evidence that mobile execution chambers existed before 97.\n\n01:08:16.940 --> 01:08:19.940\nThe state of Delaware and the United States of America\n\n01:08:19.940 --> 01:08:24.940\npurges a mobile lethal injection chamber in 1986.\n\n01:08:24.940 --> 01:08:29.940\nThe prisoner is strapped into a stretcher and killed inside the van.\n\n01:08:29.940 --> 01:08:34.940\nThe van allows death sentences to be carried out without moving the prisoner to an execution ground.\n\n01:08:34.940 --> 01:08:36.940\nWell, that's nice.\n\n01:08:36.940 --> 01:08:40.940\nIt's like a dog groomer.\n\n01:08:40.940 --> 01:08:44.940\nThe vans also require less manpower per injection.\n\n01:08:44.940 --> 01:08:46.940\nOh, no, no, no, I, I, I, I write ahead.\n\n01:08:46.940 --> 01:08:50.940\nLess manpower per execution requiring four persons to assist the injection.\n\n01:08:50.940 --> 01:08:56.940\nThe PRCU states that the vans are more humane than previous forms of execution.\n\n01:08:56.940 --> 01:08:57.940\nYeah, well.\n\n01:08:57.940 --> 01:09:00.940\nIncluding being bashed in the did-of-by-rock.\n\n01:09:00.940 --> 01:09:02.940\nYeah, yeah, like, yeah, like...\n\n01:09:02.940 --> 01:09:03.940\nThe torture monster.\n\n01:09:03.940 --> 01:09:05.940\nSmoking a cigarette with a blindfold on.\n\n01:09:05.940 --> 01:09:08.940\nChina didn't...\n\n01:09:08.940 --> 01:09:16.940\nIt may be wrong, but they didn't try to get in trouble for selling their dead prisoners to body worlds a few years ago.\n\n01:09:16.940 --> 01:09:24.940\nYeah, I hear they didn't really get caught until they were, you know, they were found out they were selling drugs to universities.\n\n01:09:24.940 --> 01:09:28.940\nYeah, well, everybody was looking at these bodies at body worlds and similar exhibits and being like,\n\n01:09:28.940 --> 01:09:30.940\nwhere are these little Chinese?\n\n01:09:30.940 --> 01:09:32.940\nAll these guys.\n\n01:09:32.940 --> 01:09:33.940\nThey were, they were selling them.\n\n01:09:33.940 --> 01:09:34.940\nYou hear that, China?\n\n01:09:34.940 --> 01:09:35.940\nWe caught you doing something bad.\n\n01:09:35.940 --> 01:09:37.940\nNow it's curtains.\n\n01:09:37.940 --> 01:09:39.940\nFinally.\n\n01:09:39.940 --> 01:09:44.940\nWe finally caught the Chinese up there up to something.\n\n01:09:44.940 --> 01:09:47.940\nLike, now it's, now it's all over for them.\n\n01:09:47.940 --> 01:09:49.940\nThey own us!\n\n01:09:49.940 --> 01:09:50.940\nThey do.\n\n01:09:50.940 --> 01:09:52.940\nThere's nothing we can do.\n\n01:09:52.940 --> 01:09:55.940\nThose vans are coming to Delaware now.\n\n01:09:55.940 --> 01:09:58.940\nWait, so these vans are just cruising about China?\n\n01:09:58.940 --> 01:10:00.940\nI don't know, ma'am.\n\n01:10:00.940 --> 01:10:03.940\nI just, I'm surprised I was right about that.\n\n01:10:03.940 --> 01:10:05.940\nIt's pretty amazing, yeah.\n\n01:10:05.940 --> 01:10:06.940\nI just know stuff.\n\n01:10:06.940 --> 01:10:08.940\nI don't know what the fuck it's all about.\n\n01:10:08.940 --> 01:10:14.940\nAlso, like, Spencer, if you're just plugging your upcoming band called Chinese Murder Band,\n\n01:10:14.940 --> 01:10:17.940\njust come out with it, because I will go to your show.\n\n01:10:17.940 --> 01:10:27.940\nIt's less of a band and more of a live experience.\n\n01:10:27.940 --> 01:10:30.940\nTomorrow night, Delaware Gas Fan.\n\n01:10:30.940 --> 01:10:31.940\nDo they still have bookmobiles?\n\n01:10:31.940 --> 01:10:33.940\nI suppose they don't anymore, right?\n\n01:10:33.940 --> 01:10:35.940\nNo, because kids kept being murdered.\n\n01:10:35.940 --> 01:10:41.940\nThey kept getting the Chinese bookmobiles, like, uh-oh.\n\n01:10:41.940 --> 01:10:47.940\nChinese bookmobiles are a good name for a band.\n\n01:10:47.940 --> 01:10:49.940\nIn the 70s, they had bookmobiles.\n\n01:10:49.940 --> 01:10:52.940\nNow the internet, I'm sure, makes us all obsolete, but it was, yeah.\n\n01:10:52.940 --> 01:10:53.940\nDid you guys have bookfairs?\n\n01:10:53.940 --> 01:10:56.940\nThere were bookfairs at our school, you mean?\n\n01:10:56.940 --> 01:10:59.940\nYeah, we had those, but that was fucking bullshit.\n\n01:10:59.940 --> 01:11:00.940\nThat's people selling books.\n\n01:11:00.940 --> 01:11:01.940\nThat's good.\n\n01:11:01.940 --> 01:11:03.940\nThe only thing you could buy there was Madness and Nancy Drew.\n\n01:11:03.940 --> 01:11:04.940\nWhat do you think a bookmobile is?\n\n01:11:04.940 --> 01:11:06.940\nA bookmobile is a library.\n\n01:11:06.940 --> 01:11:11.940\nIt's a public library on wheels, you low-road motherfucker.\n\n01:11:11.940 --> 01:11:12.940\nDamn, damn.\n\n01:11:12.940 --> 01:11:15.940\nApologize, free prompt.\n\n01:11:15.940 --> 01:11:23.940\nI'm sorry that I high-roated you on my knowledge of 70s social programs.\n\n01:11:23.940 --> 01:11:29.940\nI am remorseful both because I'm your future husband and because it again\n\n01:11:29.940 --> 01:11:33.940\nhangs a lantern on our age difference.\n\n01:11:33.940 --> 01:11:35.940\nLantern?\n\n01:11:35.940 --> 01:11:40.940\nUpdate Lantern.\n\n01:11:40.940 --> 01:11:46.940\nOh, it hangs a glow stick.\n\n01:11:46.940 --> 01:11:51.940\nOn the rave that is me being 12 years older than you.\n\n01:11:51.940 --> 01:11:57.940\nCover me in the foam of, well, cover me in the Rogaine foam.\n\n01:11:57.940 --> 01:12:06.940\nMy commitment to change will never happen again because Carter's almost dead.\n\n01:12:06.940 --> 01:12:08.940\nI'm not far behind.\n\n01:12:08.940 --> 01:12:11.940\nWhat do you know about Carter that I don't know?\n\n01:12:11.940 --> 01:12:15.940\nHe has one of these.\n\n01:12:15.940 --> 01:12:17.940\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:12:17.940 --> 01:12:19.940\nNobody has that, that's just you.\n\n01:12:19.940 --> 01:12:21.940\nIt's called a Carter.\n\n01:12:21.940 --> 01:12:22.940\nThey told me.\n\n01:12:22.940 --> 01:12:24.940\nIt's like a Lou Gehrig's thing.\n\n01:12:24.940 --> 01:12:27.940\nA Carter flap in my trachea.\n\n01:12:27.940 --> 01:12:30.940\nMorgan, do you ride horses?\n\n01:12:30.940 --> 01:12:31.940\nI do not, no.\n\n01:12:31.940 --> 01:12:34.940\nOh, okay.\n\n01:12:34.940 --> 01:12:37.940\nIs there a for two?\n\n01:12:37.940 --> 01:12:40.940\nYou're projecting so much under her.\n\n01:12:40.940 --> 01:12:43.940\nShe's just a normal lady.\n\n01:12:43.940 --> 01:12:46.940\nDo you make your own yogurt?\n\n01:12:46.940 --> 01:12:49.940\nDo you make your own yogurt?\n\n01:12:49.940 --> 01:12:51.940\nI make my own cereals.\n\n01:12:51.940 --> 01:12:56.940\nThat's like, have we ever had a hair wrap?\n\n01:12:56.940 --> 01:12:58.940\nNo, don't let the cereal thing go.\n\n01:12:58.940 --> 01:13:00.940\nYou make your own cereal?\n\n01:13:00.940 --> 01:13:02.940\nHow do you make your own cereal?\n\n01:13:02.940 --> 01:13:11.940\nShe puts each marshmallow in the, she hammers each lucky her shoe on an anvil.\n\n01:13:11.940 --> 01:13:14.940\nCatches a star from the sky.\n\n01:13:14.940 --> 01:13:20.940\nThe actual base, base lucky charms you can get from any hobby store.\n\n01:13:20.940 --> 01:13:22.940\nBut the good shit you have.\n\n01:13:22.940 --> 01:13:23.940\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:13:23.940 --> 01:13:24.940\nYou toast oats.\n\n01:13:24.940 --> 01:13:26.940\nOh, you toast oats?\n\n01:13:26.940 --> 01:13:27.940\nIt's much easier.\n\n01:13:27.940 --> 01:13:28.940\nShe toasts.\n\n01:13:28.940 --> 01:13:30.940\nAre you like a muesli person?\n\n01:13:30.940 --> 01:13:31.940\nYeah.\n\n01:13:31.940 --> 01:13:33.940\nWhat is muesli?\n\n01:13:33.940 --> 01:13:38.940\nSo I guess I can call it that, but I'll put in dates and raisins and it has sliced almonds.\n\n01:13:38.940 --> 01:13:39.940\nYeah, cause you get nasty.\n\n01:13:39.940 --> 01:13:42.940\nDoes anyone learn?\n\n01:13:42.940 --> 01:13:44.940\nI just came.\n\n01:13:44.940 --> 01:13:46.940\nI just came.\n\n01:13:46.940 --> 01:13:48.940\nAre they sugar dates?\n\n01:13:48.940 --> 01:13:50.940\nYes.\n\n01:13:50.940 --> 01:13:52.940\nOh shit.\n\n01:13:52.940 --> 01:13:54.940\nWhat do you mean?\n\n01:13:54.940 --> 01:13:56.940\nAre they sugar dates?\n\n01:13:56.940 --> 01:13:58.940\nOf course they're sugar dates.\n\n01:13:58.940 --> 01:13:59.940\nIt's a date.\n\n01:13:59.940 --> 01:14:00.940\nWhat do you do?\n\n01:14:00.940 --> 01:14:01.940\nYou eat them.\n\n01:14:01.940 --> 01:14:02.940\nI'm a graduate student.\n\n01:14:02.940 --> 01:14:03.940\nWhat are you studying?\n\n01:14:03.940 --> 01:14:04.940\nNutrition.\n\n01:14:04.940 --> 01:14:08.940\nThis is going to get so boring.\n\n01:14:08.940 --> 01:14:10.940\nIt's called bioinformatics.\n\n01:14:10.940 --> 01:14:11.940\nOkay.\n\n01:14:11.940 --> 01:14:12.940\nBio what?\n\n01:14:12.940 --> 01:14:13.940\nBioinformatics.\n\n01:14:13.940 --> 01:14:14.940\nBioinformatics?\n\n01:14:14.940 --> 01:14:15.940\nYeah.\n\n01:14:15.940 --> 01:14:16.940\nHoly shit.\n\n01:14:16.940 --> 01:14:17.940\nExplain that to me because I have no idea what that means.\n\n01:14:17.940 --> 01:14:20.940\nThat's a study of looking like you like horses and play guitar.\n\n01:14:20.940 --> 01:14:21.940\nYeah.\n\n01:14:21.940 --> 01:14:25.940\nBut if a child's trapped under a car you could flip it.\n\n01:14:25.940 --> 01:14:28.940\nYou don't hate horses.\n\n01:14:28.940 --> 01:14:32.940\nWho hates horses?\n\n01:14:32.940 --> 01:14:34.940\nSome people hate horses.\n\n01:14:34.940 --> 01:14:36.940\nIf you had more time you would write that.\n\n01:14:36.940 --> 01:14:38.940\nTell me what bioinformatics are.\n\n01:14:38.940 --> 01:14:43.940\nBioinformatics is where biology and computer science kind of mesh together.\n\n01:14:43.940 --> 01:14:46.940\nSo it's computer science related to biology and healthcare.\n\n01:14:46.940 --> 01:14:49.940\nSo how would you like to implement that?\n\n01:14:49.940 --> 01:14:50.940\nImplement.\n\n01:14:50.940 --> 01:14:51.940\nBioinformatics.\n\n01:14:51.940 --> 01:14:54.940\nWhat's a practical like?\n\n01:14:54.940 --> 01:14:55.940\nIt's a terminator.\n\n01:14:55.940 --> 01:14:56.940\nCyborg.\n\n01:14:56.940 --> 01:14:57.940\nCyborgs?\n\n01:14:57.940 --> 01:15:02.940\nYou're creating a race of super serial horses.\n\n01:15:02.940 --> 01:15:04.940\nYou got it.\n\n01:15:04.940 --> 01:15:07.940\nWho can play bridge over troubled waters.\n\n01:15:07.940 --> 01:15:10.940\nBut Morgan, what would you dream gig be?\n\n01:15:10.940 --> 01:15:11.940\nJurassic Park.\n\n01:15:11.940 --> 01:15:12.940\nJurassic Park.\n\n01:15:12.940 --> 01:15:13.940\nI didn't ask you motherfuckers.\n\n01:15:13.940 --> 01:15:14.940\nAsk Morgan.\n\n01:15:14.940 --> 01:15:16.940\nYou guys are too rowdy.\n\n01:15:16.940 --> 01:15:21.940\nI absolutely work with DNA sequencing data.\n\n01:15:21.940 --> 01:15:24.940\nHoly shit.\n\n01:15:24.940 --> 01:15:31.940\nSo if we could do some DNA engineering that would be ideal.\n\n01:15:31.940 --> 01:15:35.940\nWhat would be the highest extension of that work?\n\n01:15:35.940 --> 01:15:37.940\nWhat would you like to create or do?\n\n01:15:37.940 --> 01:15:38.940\nCloning.\n\n01:15:38.940 --> 01:15:39.940\nCloning what?\n\n01:15:39.940 --> 01:15:44.940\nBioengineering.\n\n01:15:44.940 --> 01:15:47.940\nAdam, shut up.\n\n01:15:47.940 --> 01:15:49.940\nWhat would you create?\n\n01:15:49.940 --> 01:15:51.940\nThat's pretty far removed.\n\n01:15:51.940 --> 01:15:52.940\nWhat's the highest extension of that?\n\n01:15:52.940 --> 01:15:57.940\nWhat would you like to create?\n\n01:15:57.940 --> 01:15:59.940\nYou mean like some kind of new species?\n\n01:15:59.940 --> 01:16:00.940\nYou tell me.\n\n01:16:00.940 --> 01:16:01.940\nI have no idea.\n\n01:16:01.940 --> 01:16:04.940\nYeah, I would absolutely create some kind of new species.\n\n01:16:04.940 --> 01:16:05.940\nA new species?\n\n01:16:05.940 --> 01:16:07.940\nYeah, that would be able to survive on Mars instead of Earth.\n\n01:16:07.940 --> 01:16:09.940\nWould it be a mammal?\n\n01:16:09.940 --> 01:16:10.940\nNo.\n\n01:16:10.940 --> 01:16:11.940\nOh.\n\n01:16:11.940 --> 01:16:12.940\nWhat would it be?\n\n01:16:12.940 --> 01:16:13.940\nLike an insect.\n\n01:16:13.940 --> 01:16:15.940\nIt could be cold-blooded, not on Mars.\n\n01:16:15.940 --> 01:16:18.940\nYeah, it would certainly be something amazing.\n\n01:16:18.940 --> 01:16:23.940\nA cold-blooded species that could survive on the wastes of Mars atmosphere?\n\n01:16:23.940 --> 01:16:25.940\nIt couldn't be cold-blooded.\n\n01:16:25.940 --> 01:16:29.940\nNot on Mars.\n\n01:16:29.940 --> 01:16:34.940\nIf we had a Harmontown pin-up calendar, you may be on the cover.\n\n01:16:34.940 --> 01:16:36.940\nDo you have a boyfriend?\n\n01:16:36.940 --> 01:16:37.940\nI do, yeah.\n\n01:16:37.940 --> 01:16:38.940\nHe's back here.\n\n01:16:38.940 --> 01:16:40.940\nAlright, never mind.\n\n01:16:40.940 --> 01:16:42.940\nHe's a 14-foot cockroach.\n\n01:16:42.940 --> 01:16:46.940\nI'm glad I'm here.\n\n01:16:46.940 --> 01:16:48.940\nA cyber-cockroach.\n\n01:16:48.940 --> 01:16:55.940\nHis name is Seventeen.\n\n01:16:55.940 --> 01:16:57.940\nSo you want to create new species?\n\n01:16:57.940 --> 01:17:04.940\nShe had 16 boyfriends that she made in her basement.\n\n01:17:04.940 --> 01:17:08.940\nSeventeen, I think you might be the one.\n\n01:17:08.940 --> 01:17:11.940\nUntil you out-use your youthfulness.\n\n01:17:11.940 --> 01:17:16.940\nSo you want to create a new species that might survive in outer space,\n\n01:17:16.940 --> 01:17:18.940\nor an extra-terrestrial?\n\n01:17:18.940 --> 01:17:20.940\nYeah, I think that would be amazing.\n\n01:17:20.940 --> 01:17:21.940\nThat is really cool.\n\n01:17:21.940 --> 01:17:23.940\nAnd so what life form do you think...\n\n01:17:23.940 --> 01:17:26.940\nWhen I hang out, we could be friends.\n\n01:17:26.940 --> 01:17:29.940\nWhat form, like Spencer asked, would it be a mammal?\n\n01:17:29.940 --> 01:17:32.940\nWhat kind of life do you think we could create first\n\n01:17:32.940 --> 01:17:34.940\nthat would live on moss?\n\n01:17:34.940 --> 01:17:35.940\nFirst?\n\n01:17:35.940 --> 01:17:36.940\nMoss.\n\n01:17:36.940 --> 01:17:37.940\nMoss?\n\n01:17:37.940 --> 01:17:38.940\nYeah.\n\n01:17:38.940 --> 01:17:39.940\nAre you trying to create moss right now?\n\n01:17:39.940 --> 01:17:41.940\nI'm not, no.\n\n01:17:41.940 --> 01:17:42.940\nBut if you could, would you?\n\n01:17:42.940 --> 01:17:44.940\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:17:44.940 --> 01:17:47.940\nI mean, wouldn't we all work out?\n\n01:17:47.940 --> 01:17:49.940\nLet's all just make moss.\n\n01:17:49.940 --> 01:17:50.940\nI love that.\n\n01:17:50.940 --> 01:17:51.940\nCome on, everybody knows.\n\n01:17:51.940 --> 01:17:53.940\nThat's the first terrestrial life, right?\n\n01:17:53.940 --> 01:17:56.940\nMoss is like plants without capillary action.\n\n01:17:56.940 --> 01:17:57.940\nLike, there's nothing.\n\n01:17:57.940 --> 01:18:01.940\nBefore anything, there's moss as far as open air stuff.\n\n01:18:01.940 --> 01:18:03.940\nHow did you and your boyfriend meet?\n\n01:18:03.940 --> 01:18:08.940\nAt Radio Shack.\n\n01:18:08.940 --> 01:18:09.940\nOh, that's nice.\n\n01:18:09.940 --> 01:18:11.940\nSo you guys have that shared there.\n\n01:18:11.940 --> 01:18:12.940\nThat's cool.\n\n01:18:12.940 --> 01:18:14.940\nWhat was the shared thing I didn't hear?\n\n01:18:14.940 --> 01:18:16.940\nWe were in the same department together.\n\n01:18:16.940 --> 01:18:17.940\nOh, okay.\n\n01:18:17.940 --> 01:18:18.940\nSo what...\n\n01:18:18.940 --> 01:18:20.940\nDid he ride horses, sir?\n\n01:18:20.940 --> 01:18:23.940\nNo, not yet.\n\n01:18:23.940 --> 01:18:26.940\nOh, not yet.\n\n01:18:26.940 --> 01:18:28.940\nMorgan, do you think horses could live on Mars?\n\n01:18:28.940 --> 01:18:30.940\nI hope so one day.\n\n01:18:30.940 --> 01:18:31.940\nYeah.\n\n01:18:31.940 --> 01:18:36.940\nAren't you worried about the moss becoming sentient and...\n\n01:18:36.940 --> 01:18:37.940\nThat would be amazing.\n\n01:18:37.940 --> 01:18:41.940\nWell, yeah, I guess by the time, by the time whatever we create becomes sentient, like,\n\n01:18:41.940 --> 01:18:43.940\nwe'll be God, right?\n\n01:18:43.940 --> 01:18:44.940\nAnd we'll be bored.\n\n01:18:44.940 --> 01:18:47.940\nAnd we'll be like, go ahead, kill us.\n\n01:18:47.940 --> 01:18:50.940\nWe did it to our God.\n\n01:18:50.940 --> 01:18:52.940\nI saw this comment.\n\n01:18:52.940 --> 01:18:54.940\nI'll put my head on the block.\n\n01:18:54.940 --> 01:18:59.940\nJust, I swear, I gotta stop putting that apple tree in the garden.\n\n01:18:59.940 --> 01:19:00.940\nWhat was I thinking?\n\n01:19:00.940 --> 01:19:01.940\nWhat do you think?\n\n01:19:01.940 --> 01:19:02.940\nLike, what's your...\n\n01:19:02.940 --> 01:19:03.940\nDo you like Jurassic Park?\n\n01:19:03.940 --> 01:19:04.940\nWhat are your...\n\n01:19:04.940 --> 01:19:06.940\nYeah, I like Jurassic Park.\n\n01:19:06.940 --> 01:19:07.940\nDo you...\n\n01:19:07.940 --> 01:19:11.940\nI think that it could be realistic.\n\n01:19:11.940 --> 01:19:12.940\nYeah.\n\n01:19:12.940 --> 01:19:13.940\nWoo!\n\n01:19:13.940 --> 01:19:14.940\nStop!\n\n01:19:14.940 --> 01:19:17.940\nWhat is that?\n\n01:19:17.940 --> 01:19:19.940\nThere's an absolute...\n\n01:19:19.940 --> 01:19:21.940\nI hope that these people didn't come with Morgan.\n\n01:19:21.940 --> 01:19:22.940\nThere's like a very...\n\n01:19:22.940 --> 01:19:28.940\nI was getting upset about the people yelling stuff out, but the thing is, there's like some\n\n01:19:28.940 --> 01:19:32.940\nvery passionate dinosaur people.\n\n01:19:32.940 --> 01:19:34.940\nAnd they've committed to their role.\n\n01:19:34.940 --> 01:19:37.940\nLike, they keep bending every subject.\n\n01:19:37.940 --> 01:19:38.940\nDinosaurs!\n\n01:19:38.940 --> 01:19:39.940\nThe last raptor!\n\n01:19:39.940 --> 01:19:42.940\nLike a Jurassic Park!\n\n01:19:42.940 --> 01:19:45.940\nAnd there's like three of them and they're right over there.\n\n01:19:45.940 --> 01:19:47.940\nJeff Goldblum's character.\n\n01:19:47.940 --> 01:19:49.940\nThey're really into dinosaurs.\n\n01:19:49.940 --> 01:19:50.940\nThey really went...\n\n01:19:50.940 --> 01:19:51.940\nLike, finds a way!\n\n01:19:51.940 --> 01:19:52.940\nYes, yes.\n\n01:19:52.940 --> 01:19:53.940\nYes.\n\n01:19:53.940 --> 01:19:54.940\nYes.\n\n01:19:54.940 --> 01:19:56.940\nMust go faster.\n\n01:19:56.940 --> 01:19:57.940\nMust go faster.\n\n01:19:57.940 --> 01:19:58.940\nCheetah speed.\n\n01:19:58.940 --> 01:19:59.940\nCheetah speed.\n\n01:19:59.940 --> 01:20:02.940\nIt's actually my college roommate who's screaming out.\n\n01:20:02.940 --> 01:20:04.940\nLife finds a way.\n\n01:20:04.940 --> 01:20:10.940\nIt's actually an all-female Jurassic Park cover band called Clever Girl.\n\n01:20:10.940 --> 01:20:15.940\nGod damn it, you cocksucker.\n\n01:20:15.940 --> 01:20:16.940\nWhat?\n\n01:20:16.940 --> 01:20:17.940\nClever Girl.\n\n01:20:17.940 --> 01:20:18.940\nWhat?\n\n01:20:18.940 --> 01:20:19.940\nClever Girl.\n\n01:20:19.940 --> 01:20:20.940\nClever Girl.\n\n01:20:20.940 --> 01:20:21.940\nClever Girl.\n\n01:20:21.940 --> 01:20:22.940\nClever Girl.\n\n01:20:22.940 --> 01:20:25.940\nI'm in a band called Cheetah Speed.\n\n01:20:25.940 --> 01:20:28.940\nA guy shouted out Clever Girl.\n\n01:20:28.940 --> 01:20:34.940\nI'm in a band called The Mirrored Cabinets Make Me Nervous Who Knows When They're Gonna\n\n01:20:34.940 --> 01:20:35.940\nAttack.\n\n01:20:35.940 --> 01:20:36.940\nClever Girl.\n\n01:20:36.940 --> 01:20:37.940\nClever Girl.\n\n01:20:37.940 --> 01:20:38.940\nClever Girl.\n\n01:20:38.940 --> 01:20:39.940\nClever Girl.\n\n01:20:39.940 --> 01:20:40.940\nClever Girl.\n\n01:20:40.940 --> 01:20:46.940\nI love the idea of having that much presence of mind upon your death by murder.\n\n01:20:46.940 --> 01:20:49.940\nJust admiring your murder art.\n\n01:20:49.940 --> 01:20:51.940\nI don't think that's ever happened in the history of...\n\n01:20:51.940 --> 01:20:56.940\nHe spent the entire movie explaining to Jeff Goldblum and to everybody else.\n\n01:20:56.940 --> 01:20:57.940\nThey hunt.\n\n01:20:57.940 --> 01:20:59.940\nThey're not lizards.\n\n01:20:59.940 --> 01:21:01.940\nThey hunt like they're people.\n\n01:21:01.940 --> 01:21:03.940\nThey have huge brains.\n\n01:21:03.940 --> 01:21:05.940\nAnd they go over here.\n\n01:21:05.940 --> 01:21:06.940\nAnd he sees...\n\n01:21:06.940 --> 01:21:09.940\nThat's all the more reason for him to not be amazed at that moment.\n\n01:21:09.940 --> 01:21:11.940\nHe should be like, fuck, fuck.\n\n01:21:11.940 --> 01:21:12.940\nNo.\n\n01:21:12.940 --> 01:21:15.940\nWhat am I, retarded?\n\n01:21:15.940 --> 01:21:17.940\nThat's him being amazed.\n\n01:21:17.940 --> 01:21:19.940\nGod damn it, I was right.\n\n01:21:19.940 --> 01:21:21.940\nHe goes, Clever Girl, you son of a bitch.\n\n01:21:21.940 --> 01:21:24.940\nNo, but he went, Clever Girl.\n\n01:21:24.940 --> 01:21:26.940\nLike, he was coming as he died.\n\n01:21:26.940 --> 01:21:27.940\nNo.\n\n01:21:27.940 --> 01:21:29.940\nI'm so honored to be eaten this way.\n\n01:21:29.940 --> 01:21:32.940\nHe's saying I slightly underestimated you.\n\n01:21:32.940 --> 01:21:34.940\nHe should have said, you know what he should have said, and I would have bought this.\n\n01:21:34.940 --> 01:21:35.940\nGame recognized game.\n\n01:21:35.940 --> 01:21:36.940\nGame?\n\n01:21:36.940 --> 01:21:45.940\nSpeaking of game recognized game, let's play some D&D.\n\n01:21:49.940 --> 01:21:51.940\nYes, let's.\n\n01:21:54.940 --> 01:22:01.940\nWhen we last met, our heroes had burned their way through Bill Martigans and found themselves in an icy wasteland,\n\n01:22:01.940 --> 01:22:05.940\ntrapped in a net and facing down a terrible yeti.\n\n01:22:05.940 --> 01:22:09.940\nBut before they could escape, they were met with a familiar face.\n\n01:22:09.940 --> 01:22:13.940\nTylenol with codeine, the unicorn had returned.\n\n01:22:13.940 --> 01:22:19.940\nThe unicorn convinced the yeti to let our friends free, and together they adjourned to Tylenol's hideout in the snow.\n\n01:22:19.940 --> 01:22:25.940\nThere they sucked on cinnamon toast and pop tarts and cocoa, and had a great, if dizzying, discussion\n\n01:22:25.940 --> 01:22:30.940\nwhich led, in a codeine-fueled bender, to the purple caverns of Tamarind.\n\n01:22:30.940 --> 01:22:35.940\nIn the caverns, Tylenol bit them onward towards strange and magical gems,\n\n01:22:35.940 --> 01:22:39.940\nand as they did so, the gems transformed into creatures.\n\n01:22:39.940 --> 01:22:43.940\nSquark smashed one of them, and Sharpie ensnared the others,\n\n01:22:43.940 --> 01:22:47.940\nand the gang began to wonder about the sanity of their friend Tylenol.\n\n01:22:47.940 --> 01:22:51.940\nBut then Sharpie took a shit on the floor.\n\n01:22:51.940 --> 01:22:55.940\nWould our heroes be able to stomach the foul stench?\n\n01:22:55.940 --> 01:23:02.940\nWere the crystalline critters indeed wondrous treasure? Was the unicorn still around, or had he disappeared?\n\n01:23:02.940 --> 01:23:09.940\nFind out next time on an exciting new edition of Harmontown, today, right now.\n\n01:23:11.940 --> 01:23:16.940\nIf the unicorn, if Tylenol's still there, we could have Demorge come up and play him.\n\n01:23:16.940 --> 01:23:18.940\nDemorge, are you here?\n\n01:23:18.940 --> 01:23:21.940\nDemorge Brown at the stage, please.\n\n01:23:21.940 --> 01:23:24.940\nUnless you just wanted to have him evaporate.\n\n01:23:24.940 --> 01:23:25.940\nIt's all good.\n\n01:23:25.940 --> 01:23:28.940\nDemorge, you should play Mulrainee.\n\n01:23:28.940 --> 01:23:32.940\nIt's Demorge Brown, Harmontown regular.\n\n01:23:32.940 --> 01:23:35.940\nSoccer enthusiast.\n\n01:23:35.940 --> 01:23:37.940\nThat is correct.\n\n01:23:37.940 --> 01:23:39.940\nHow was my sports corner?\n\n01:23:39.940 --> 01:23:43.940\nIt was informative, in a way.\n\n01:23:43.940 --> 01:23:48.940\nI was impressed that you got the teams right.\n\n01:23:48.940 --> 01:23:54.940\nRight now, these creatures have turned into gems, and we started kicking their butts, right?\n\n01:23:54.940 --> 01:23:57.940\nThere's these gems that turned into creatures, really.\n\n01:23:57.940 --> 01:23:58.940\nThat's what it is.\n\n01:23:58.940 --> 01:24:03.940\nThey're all tied up in Sharpie's ropes, or his vines, rather.\n\n01:24:03.940 --> 01:24:05.940\nThey're not moving, they're tied up.\n\n01:24:05.940 --> 01:24:07.940\nIt's as if they're in a net.\n\n01:24:07.940 --> 01:24:14.940\nMorgan, you're going to play Christopher, and Demorge, you're going to play Tylenol Cody.\n\n01:24:14.940 --> 01:24:16.940\nUnicorn.\n\n01:24:16.940 --> 01:24:21.940\nAnd you're real sassy.\n\n01:24:21.940 --> 01:24:27.940\nI wonder what Barack Obama would say about Chinese murder vans.\n\n01:24:27.940 --> 01:24:31.940\nWell, look.\n\n01:24:31.940 --> 01:24:43.940\nTheoretically speaking, if there's a van with murderous equipment inside of it,\n\n01:24:43.940 --> 01:24:47.940\nthere has to be a driver.\n\n01:24:47.940 --> 01:24:53.940\nThe legal question, just going by my background in civil rights and constitutional law,\n\n01:24:53.940 --> 01:25:03.940\nis the driver separate from the one pulling the strings?\n\n01:25:03.940 --> 01:25:05.940\nWhat I've done is convene a committee to convene a committee,\n\n01:25:05.940 --> 01:25:11.940\nand we're going to reach out across the aisle to some good folks.\n\n01:25:11.940 --> 01:25:15.940\nSee if we can't get to the bottom of this issue,\n\n01:25:15.940 --> 01:25:19.940\nand when we do, we'll certainly come forward and talk more in depth about that.\n\n01:25:19.940 --> 01:25:27.940\nWhat I'm not prepared to do at this time is go on the record about whether or not\n\n01:25:27.940 --> 01:25:34.940\nmurder vans exist in this country.\n\n01:25:34.940 --> 01:25:42.940\nDo you have to define murder? Do you have to define ban?\n\n01:25:42.940 --> 01:25:51.940\nAnybody in good citizens with information about this need to hit us up at whitehouse.gov.\n\n01:25:51.940 --> 01:25:56.940\nFor a limited time, we're giving away White House sugar cookies.\n\n01:25:56.940 --> 01:26:00.940\nWhat goes on at whitehouse.gov? What's the website like? What's the splash page?\n\n01:26:00.940 --> 01:26:07.940\nIt's really cool. You get to pilot a drone over Kansas, and you can just monitor people.\n\n01:26:07.940 --> 01:26:17.940\nLet me be clear about that. That is a simulator.\n\n01:26:17.940 --> 01:26:25.940\nIt's not an actual drone, but it is a good way, using URLs to track back and find people,\n\n01:26:25.940 --> 01:26:31.940\naddresses, and things who are qualified and are good, and we need good people to pilot drones.\n\n01:26:31.940 --> 01:26:38.940\nOnce again, we've got your information, we'll find you.\n\n01:26:38.940 --> 01:26:40.940\nThank you, Barack.\n\n01:26:40.940 --> 01:26:44.940\nHe's a good guy. He's very folksy.\n\n01:26:44.940 --> 01:26:47.940\nHe's kind of fake folksy. He sounds folksy.\n\n01:26:47.940 --> 01:26:54.940\nHe's folksy? He's erudite? I'm not sure where he was born.\n\n01:26:54.940 --> 01:26:56.940\nBut he feels American.\n\n01:26:56.940 --> 01:27:01.940\nBarack, can we take this moment at Harmontown? No one's listening. No one's recording.\n\n01:27:01.940 --> 01:27:03.940\nCan we learn where exactly...\n\n01:27:03.940 --> 01:27:05.940\nNo one's listening. Everybody's listening.\n\n01:27:05.940 --> 01:27:07.940\nWhat your citizenship actually is?\n\n01:27:07.940 --> 01:27:13.940\nWell, look, I'll do this one last time.\n\n01:27:13.940 --> 01:27:18.940\nI was born in a hospital.\n\n01:27:18.940 --> 01:27:22.940\nThank you.\n\n01:27:22.940 --> 01:27:27.940\nIt comes up from time to time, and a fellow asked me if I was an eggplant.\n\n01:27:27.940 --> 01:27:33.940\nLook, man, you've got to do your own due diligence on this stuff.\n\n01:27:33.940 --> 01:27:38.940\nFor the last time, born in a hospital, ate Gerber food as a child.\n\n01:27:38.940 --> 01:27:45.940\nI don't even think you can get that in Canada, so I think you know where I'm from.\n\n01:27:45.940 --> 01:27:50.940\nYou seem more and more evasive. The more questions we ask, the more evasive it becomes.\n\n01:27:50.940 --> 01:27:53.940\nWell, wouldn't you? It's more fun.\n\n01:27:53.940 --> 01:27:56.940\nIt's more fun? It's more fun.\n\n01:27:56.940 --> 01:27:58.940\nYeah, I like that.\n\n01:27:58.940 --> 01:28:02.940\nJeff, are you leading us towards being a birther podcast?\n\n01:28:02.940 --> 01:28:08.940\nYes. Oh, dude, I'm a fucking way birther from way back.\n\n01:28:08.940 --> 01:28:10.940\nI'm a diet in the whole...\n\n01:28:10.940 --> 01:28:14.940\nCarry me out in a box birther.\n\n01:28:14.940 --> 01:28:22.940\nNow that you find out I'm a fucking hardline right-winger.\n\n01:28:22.940 --> 01:28:25.940\nYes, I'm a Jeff-winger.\n\n01:28:25.940 --> 01:28:29.940\nThat's Adam Goldberg being hacked in the audience, so they're repeating him.\n\n01:28:29.940 --> 01:28:33.940\nJeff or Adam is particularly drunk.\n\n01:28:33.940 --> 01:28:35.940\nYeah.\n\n01:28:35.940 --> 01:28:37.940\nAdam, are you fucked up right now?\n\n01:28:37.940 --> 01:28:42.940\nOh, dear God.\n\n01:28:42.940 --> 01:28:45.940\nIt doesn't enhance your personality.\n\n01:28:45.940 --> 01:28:49.940\nAll right, Spencer.\n\n01:28:49.940 --> 01:28:51.940\nDuly noted.\n\n01:28:51.940 --> 01:28:55.940\nSpencer, okay, so what are we looking at right now? Describe our surroundings.\n\n01:28:55.940 --> 01:29:01.940\nYou're in the purple caverns. Behind you is the cavern exit. It goes into the purple canyon.\n\n01:29:01.940 --> 01:29:10.940\nBefore you is a pile of crushed sapphire and also a ruby red crab and an emerald beetle.\n\n01:29:10.940 --> 01:29:15.940\nThey're tied up in vines, as I said earlier. They've been tied up.\n\n01:29:15.940 --> 01:29:18.940\nYou tied them up last week.\n\n01:29:18.940 --> 01:29:20.940\nWere they animate?\n\n01:29:20.940 --> 01:29:23.940\nThey were. They were animating right towards you.\n\n01:29:23.940 --> 01:29:26.940\nSorry. Dad was a little drunk last week.\n\n01:29:26.940 --> 01:29:33.940\nI mean, no judgments.\n\n01:29:33.940 --> 01:29:37.940\nI tied these crabs up because they have ill intent.\n\n01:29:37.940 --> 01:29:40.940\nThey certainly seemed that way.\n\n01:29:40.940 --> 01:29:44.940\nAll right, let's kill the remaining gem beetles.\n\n01:29:44.940 --> 01:29:47.940\nYou want to lead the attack, Sharpie?\n\n01:29:47.940 --> 01:29:49.940\nSure.\n\n01:29:49.940 --> 01:29:51.940\nBy the power of...\n\n01:29:51.940 --> 01:29:53.940\nGreyskull.\n\n01:29:53.940 --> 01:29:58.940\nWhat do you do, Adam Goldberg?\n\n01:29:58.940 --> 01:30:01.940\nNo, I would have said that.\n\n01:30:01.940 --> 01:30:06.940\nGently.\n\n01:30:06.940 --> 01:30:15.940\nBoy, I feel like it's been ages since I've recharged my...\n\n01:30:15.940 --> 01:30:19.940\nI think Ray of Frost is like a zero level spell that does like zero to two damage.\n\n01:30:19.940 --> 01:30:20.940\nSure is.\n\n01:30:20.940 --> 01:30:24.940\nSharpie, real quick, why are we in this cave right now?\n\n01:30:24.940 --> 01:30:26.940\nDude, ask them.\n\n01:30:26.940 --> 01:30:27.940\nAnd what are we doing?\n\n01:30:27.940 --> 01:30:32.940\nGreg Proups played Tylenol with Koenini, whisked us off to this purple cave.\n\n01:30:32.940 --> 01:30:41.940\nSpencer just sat there listening as Proups basically DM'd.\n\n01:30:41.940 --> 01:30:43.940\nI feel like I helped.\n\n01:30:43.940 --> 01:30:46.940\nNo, no, no, I wasn't disparaging.\n\n01:30:46.940 --> 01:30:48.940\nSpencer and Greg just invent that cave?\n\n01:30:48.940 --> 01:30:51.940\nYou know, it's a cave.\n\n01:30:51.940 --> 01:30:52.940\nI didn't know that.\n\n01:30:52.940 --> 01:30:57.940\nIt's a wide world, this Dungeons and Dragons place.\n\n01:30:57.940 --> 01:31:02.940\nWe were just whisked off to this place and we just kind of like, yeah, we don't know what we're doing here\n\n01:31:02.940 --> 01:31:05.940\nand there's these crab beetles, gem things.\n\n01:31:05.940 --> 01:31:10.940\nI just, god damn it, do I have Scorching Ray? Is that depleted?\n\n01:31:10.940 --> 01:31:12.940\nYes, it's not depleted.\n\n01:31:12.940 --> 01:31:13.940\nYou have it.\n\n01:31:13.940 --> 01:31:19.940\nScorching Ray on the nearest gem crab beetle.\n\n01:31:19.940 --> 01:31:22.940\nYou were in a blackout last time, weren't you?\n\n01:31:22.940 --> 01:31:25.940\nWould seem so.\n\n01:31:25.940 --> 01:31:32.940\nYou blast it with a scorching ray and it seems to be burned to a kind of rocky crisp\n\n01:31:32.940 --> 01:31:36.940\njust as all black and cloudy and doesn't move anymore.\n\n01:31:36.940 --> 01:31:39.940\nClever girl.\n\n01:31:39.940 --> 01:31:42.940\nDoes it count when you're killing something?\n\n01:31:42.940 --> 01:31:44.940\nMaybe.\n\n01:31:44.940 --> 01:31:49.940\nThere's one thing left, it's also tied up and not moving.\n\n01:31:49.940 --> 01:31:51.940\nOne of you guys do the honors.\n\n01:31:51.940 --> 01:31:53.940\nWhat does it look like?\n\n01:31:53.940 --> 01:31:56.940\nA green beetle made of emerald.\n\n01:31:56.940 --> 01:32:04.940\nI take my mighty great sword and I just do a vertical slice down the middle of it.\n\n01:32:04.940 --> 01:32:09.940\nYeah, it's pretty much immobile so you do that and slice it right in half.\n\n01:32:09.940 --> 01:32:14.940\nIt doesn't move anymore, it's just two hunks of an emerald beetle.\n\n01:32:14.940 --> 01:32:16.940\nIs it already dead?\n\n01:32:16.940 --> 01:32:19.940\nIt is now.\n\n01:32:19.940 --> 01:32:22.940\nI examine the loot.\n\n01:32:22.940 --> 01:32:25.940\nIt's definitely made out of some form of emerald.\n\n01:32:25.940 --> 01:32:30.940\nIt might be worth money if you sold it to someone who is into that.\n\n01:32:30.940 --> 01:32:34.940\nEverybody scoop all this shit up because we were on a million adventures\n\n01:32:34.940 --> 01:32:38.940\nand then the last time we tried to buy a hot dog and then we were broke\n\n01:32:38.940 --> 01:32:41.940\nbecause we never bothered to pick up any of this shit.\n\n01:32:41.940 --> 01:32:44.940\nWe spend a turn picking all this shit up.\n\n01:32:44.940 --> 01:32:48.940\nYou pick all this shit up.\n\n01:32:48.940 --> 01:32:50.940\nYou put it in a bag or whatever.\n\n01:32:50.940 --> 01:32:53.940\nA tiny goes in a big bag of holding.\n\n01:32:53.940 --> 01:32:56.940\nThat happens.\n\n01:32:56.940 --> 01:32:58.940\nAlright, we're rich.\n\n01:32:58.940 --> 01:32:59.940\nAre we?\n\n01:32:59.940 --> 01:33:03.940\nWell you have items that might be worth value if traded.\n\n01:33:03.940 --> 01:33:08.940\nLooks like having a lot of sugar or something.\n\n01:33:08.940 --> 01:33:13.940\nI look around the purple cavern for an exit, not the one we came in.\n\n01:33:13.940 --> 01:33:15.940\nYou see it seems to go deeper in.\n\n01:33:15.940 --> 01:33:19.940\nThere's a dark crack that makes it, you know, there's no light in it.\n\n01:33:19.940 --> 01:33:21.940\nThere's a dark crack.\n\n01:33:21.940 --> 01:33:23.940\nI examine that crack.\n\n01:33:23.940 --> 01:33:25.940\nIt's so dark you can't see.\n\n01:33:25.940 --> 01:33:28.940\nI sniff the crack.\n\n01:33:28.940 --> 01:33:33.940\nIt smells like metal, like metal.\n\n01:33:33.940 --> 01:33:36.940\nMetal crack.\n\n01:33:36.940 --> 01:33:39.940\nI use my goggles at my nude scene.\n\n01:33:39.940 --> 01:33:41.940\nYeah.\n\n01:33:41.940 --> 01:33:45.940\nYou see the crack up really close.\n\n01:33:45.940 --> 01:33:49.940\nI turn around and go, waste of time.\n\n01:33:49.940 --> 01:33:51.940\nMage light.\n\n01:33:51.940 --> 01:33:53.940\nYou light it up.\n\n01:33:53.940 --> 01:33:57.940\nYou see it's like maybe within this crack you might be able to squeeze through\n\n01:33:57.940 --> 01:34:01.940\nbut there's like a seven foot space that kind of goes around a bend.\n\n01:34:01.940 --> 01:34:04.940\nIt's like a, you know, like a corner or something.\n\n01:34:04.940 --> 01:34:05.940\nThrough the crack?\n\n01:34:05.940 --> 01:34:09.940\nYeah, so it's like there's a little space and then it rounds a bend.\n\n01:34:09.940 --> 01:34:11.940\nIs it big enough for a gnome to fit through?\n\n01:34:11.940 --> 01:34:12.940\nDefinitely.\n\n01:34:12.940 --> 01:34:14.940\nI crawl through that crack.\n\n01:34:14.940 --> 01:34:17.940\nAnd you see there's this little bend I talked about earlier.\n\n01:34:17.940 --> 01:34:18.940\nI round that bend.\n\n01:34:18.940 --> 01:34:23.940\nThe venture rounds the bend in what you see astonishes and frightens you.\n\n01:34:23.940 --> 01:34:34.940\nYou see sitting upon a raised stone flat or a platform, a massive, it must be at least fully grown adult black dragon.\n\n01:34:34.940 --> 01:34:39.940\nIt must be half asleep, if not more than half asleep.\n\n01:34:39.940 --> 01:34:42.940\nHave you seen any dragons come back?\n\n01:34:42.940 --> 01:34:49.940\nI go back to our campaign and I say this, there's a sleeping black dragon over there.\n\n01:34:49.940 --> 01:34:56.940\nAre they worse than regular dragons or is that just...\n\n01:34:56.940 --> 01:34:59.940\nCan I use my ability to detect evil?\n\n01:34:59.940 --> 01:35:07.940\nYou use your ability to detect evil. You detect evil.\n\n01:35:07.940 --> 01:35:11.940\nRacist.\n\n01:35:11.940 --> 01:35:18.940\nAlright guys, we got an evil black dragon sleeping on a slab over there.\n\n01:35:18.940 --> 01:35:21.940\nThey should mention white dragons are evil too.\n\n01:35:21.940 --> 01:35:25.940\nAre all dragons, is there a color of dragon that's not evil?\n\n01:35:25.940 --> 01:35:27.940\nGolden dragons.\n\n01:35:27.940 --> 01:35:36.940\nBut don't they have mobile murder vans?\n\n01:35:36.940 --> 01:35:41.940\nLook, I'm just a white dragon, all I know is racist.\n\n01:35:41.940 --> 01:35:44.940\nHe's trying to figure out which race is worse.\n\n01:35:44.940 --> 01:35:50.940\nCan we send Codeine with Tylenol in there? He's a magic unicorn.\n\n01:35:50.940 --> 01:35:55.940\nCan I reduce him with my shrinky person thing?\n\n01:35:55.940 --> 01:35:56.940\nWho?\n\n01:35:56.940 --> 01:35:57.940\nWon't work on Tylenol?\n\n01:35:57.940 --> 01:36:00.940\nNo, he's a magical beast.\n\n01:36:00.940 --> 01:36:02.940\nSo are you by the way?\n\n01:36:02.940 --> 01:36:04.940\nI wish.\n\n01:36:04.940 --> 01:36:06.940\nCan I fit with the crack?\n\n01:36:06.940 --> 01:36:10.940\nYeah, you can. I don't think Tylenol can fit through.\n\n01:36:10.940 --> 01:36:12.940\nIt's not a horse-sized crack.\n\n01:36:12.940 --> 01:36:22.940\nOkay, I'm going to take some pieces of my rope,\n\n01:36:22.940 --> 01:36:25.940\nand I'm going to take the red paint from my craft supplies\n\n01:36:25.940 --> 01:36:28.940\nand I'm going to splatter it all over me like I've been injured.\n\n01:36:28.940 --> 01:36:31.940\nWait, what are you doing with the rope though?\n\n01:36:31.940 --> 01:36:34.940\nLike, I've been restrained, but I broke them free.\n\n01:36:34.940 --> 01:36:37.940\nSo I'm going to take the ropes, I'm going to wrap them around my hands,\n\n01:36:37.940 --> 01:36:40.940\nbut I'm going to cut them down the middle so it looks like someone's freed me.\n\n01:36:40.940 --> 01:36:41.940\nOkay.\n\n01:36:41.940 --> 01:36:43.940\nOkay.\n\n01:36:43.940 --> 01:36:44.940\nScoops.\n\n01:36:44.940 --> 01:36:45.940\nWhat?\n\n01:36:45.940 --> 01:36:53.940\nIf you go in there and try to like run some kind of quick change game on a black dragon,\n\n01:36:53.940 --> 01:36:55.940\nno one else can fit through the crack.\n\n01:36:55.940 --> 01:36:58.940\nI can. I'm going to know if I can fit through it.\n\n01:36:58.940 --> 01:37:01.940\nI can't get through there. Well, I could teleport through there maybe.\n\n01:37:01.940 --> 01:37:03.940\nBut let's talk about this.\n\n01:37:03.940 --> 01:37:06.940\nIt's not an episode of the Brady Bunch.\n\n01:37:06.940 --> 01:37:09.940\nWe're not gluing a vase back together.\n\n01:37:09.940 --> 01:37:11.940\nWhat's our end game?\n\n01:37:11.940 --> 01:37:14.940\nYou've got to share with us. What are you doing?\n\n01:37:14.940 --> 01:37:17.940\nWell, I'm going to slip through the crack,\n\n01:37:17.940 --> 01:37:27.940\nand then I'm going to pretend that I've just been tortured by people who hate the black dragon.\n\n01:37:27.940 --> 01:37:29.940\nBut I love the black dragon.\n\n01:37:29.940 --> 01:37:31.940\nAnd I come in and I say, like, are you okay?\n\n01:37:31.940 --> 01:37:36.940\nLike, I got free.\n\n01:37:36.940 --> 01:37:43.940\nWhere are you vulnerable?\n\n01:37:43.940 --> 01:37:48.940\nGuys, this is crazy enough to work.\n\n01:37:48.940 --> 01:37:55.940\nIf only God was six, all of your plans would always work.\n\n01:37:55.940 --> 01:37:58.940\nThat'll be the name of my autobiography.\n\n01:37:58.940 --> 01:38:01.940\nAre you there, God? And can't you be six?\n\n01:38:01.940 --> 01:38:04.940\nSo some of my hair braids' beams can work.\n\n01:38:04.940 --> 01:38:07.940\nBut I'm going to really, I'll slather it on.\n\n01:38:07.940 --> 01:38:11.940\nI'm a charming elf.\n\n01:38:11.940 --> 01:38:13.940\nHalf elf.\n\n01:38:13.940 --> 01:38:15.940\nDo you speak draconic?\n\n01:38:15.940 --> 01:38:16.940\nWhat?\n\n01:38:16.940 --> 01:38:17.940\nDo you speak draconic?\n\n01:38:17.940 --> 01:38:19.940\nToads?\n\n01:38:19.940 --> 01:38:21.940\nDo you speak draconic, somebody asked?\n\n01:38:21.940 --> 01:38:22.940\nDo you speak dragon?\n\n01:38:22.940 --> 01:38:27.940\nLook at your sheets.\n\n01:38:27.940 --> 01:38:28.940\nThere's an answer.\n\n01:38:28.940 --> 01:38:32.940\nYour sheet is the thing with vodka spilled on it.\n\n01:38:32.940 --> 01:38:35.940\nI don't technically speak draconic,\n\n01:38:35.940 --> 01:38:41.940\nbut I think I speak emotions.\n\n01:38:41.940 --> 01:38:45.940\nYeah, like evil dragons do.\n\n01:38:45.940 --> 01:38:48.940\nI speak elvish and I speak common.\n\n01:38:48.940 --> 01:38:52.940\nMaybe this dragon, does the dragons speak common?\n\n01:38:52.940 --> 01:38:53.940\nYou don't know.\n\n01:38:53.940 --> 01:38:57.940\nDragons are highly intelligent beings, you know.\n\n01:38:57.940 --> 01:39:00.940\nI feel like a lot of times we feel compelled to do things\n\n01:39:00.940 --> 01:39:06.940\njust because it seems like we could.\n\n01:39:06.940 --> 01:39:08.940\nAnd we don't stop to think if we should.\n\n01:39:08.940 --> 01:39:16.940\nAm I right, dinosaur people?\n\n01:39:16.940 --> 01:39:18.940\nThe great thing about Dungeons and Dragons\n\n01:39:18.940 --> 01:39:20.940\nis as opposed to a video game or a pop-up book\n\n01:39:20.940 --> 01:39:23.940\nyou read to your kid in bed, like,\n\n01:39:23.940 --> 01:39:27.940\nthere's no, we could fucking walk away.\n\n01:39:27.940 --> 01:39:30.940\nThis dragon is a whole crack away from us.\n\n01:39:30.940 --> 01:39:32.940\nWe can actually shout through the crack,\n\n01:39:32.940 --> 01:39:35.940\nfuck you, black dragons suck, and walk away.\n\n01:39:35.940 --> 01:39:38.940\nIs that how you want to live your life, Sharpie?\n\n01:39:38.940 --> 01:39:43.940\nAvoiding every dragon and walking away from every emerald beetle?\n\n01:39:43.940 --> 01:39:45.940\nI killed the emerald beetles.\n\n01:39:45.940 --> 01:39:47.940\nHe'd show me the emerald beetle.\n\n01:39:47.940 --> 01:39:51.940\nI'll fucking slay it like a master born into the task.\n\n01:39:51.940 --> 01:39:53.940\nIt's a black dragon.\n\n01:39:53.940 --> 01:39:55.940\nWe're constantly getting our asses kicked\n\n01:39:55.940 --> 01:39:59.940\nand doing bad things to good people.\n\n01:39:59.940 --> 01:40:04.940\nIt's just, like, our life has become a waking nightmare.\n\n01:40:04.940 --> 01:40:07.940\nOutside this purple cavern is a wasteland.\n\n01:40:07.940 --> 01:40:09.940\nIt's a snowy wasteland.\n\n01:40:09.940 --> 01:40:11.940\nWell, that was weeks away.\n\n01:40:11.940 --> 01:40:13.940\nYou're out of the frozen.\n\n01:40:13.940 --> 01:40:15.940\nIt's a lot warmer now.\n\n01:40:15.940 --> 01:40:17.940\nI say we walk up the front door.\n\n01:40:17.940 --> 01:40:19.940\nLike men.\n\n01:40:19.940 --> 01:40:21.940\nPowerfully men.\n\n01:40:21.940 --> 01:40:24.940\nWe leave sleeping dragons lie.\n\n01:40:24.940 --> 01:40:26.940\nHe's not going anywhere.\n\n01:40:26.940 --> 01:40:30.940\nHe's going to be just as dragon-y, just as black.\n\n01:40:30.940 --> 01:40:32.940\nJust as behind a tiny crab.\n\n01:40:32.940 --> 01:40:34.940\nWhere are we going?\n\n01:40:34.940 --> 01:40:37.940\nI'm Maya Angelou.\n\n01:40:37.940 --> 01:40:40.940\nLie.\n\n01:40:40.940 --> 01:40:42.940\nToo soon?\n\n01:40:42.940 --> 01:40:44.940\nI can ride him out of there.\n\n01:40:44.940 --> 01:40:49.940\nI'm just suggesting that we're not ready for this boss level.\n\n01:40:49.940 --> 01:40:51.940\nAll right, fine.\n\n01:40:51.940 --> 01:40:53.940\nI jump on Tylenol with Coding's back.\n\n01:40:53.940 --> 01:40:54.940\nAnd I say,\n\n01:40:54.940 --> 01:40:56.940\nWe're PA!\n\n01:40:56.940 --> 01:40:59.940\nYou do that.\n\n01:40:59.940 --> 01:41:01.940\nAnd it gets it.\n\n01:41:01.940 --> 01:41:05.940\nCan the rest of them get on me?\n\n01:41:05.940 --> 01:41:07.940\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:41:07.940 --> 01:41:09.940\nWe have a sturdy frame.\n\n01:41:09.940 --> 01:41:13.940\nOkay, we all get on Tylenol's back and I raise.\n\n01:41:13.940 --> 01:41:15.940\nWe just see a black dragon and go,\n\n01:41:15.940 --> 01:41:18.940\nWell, Jeff, I mean, what's your name?\n\n01:41:18.940 --> 01:41:20.940\nCan we talk about what we want?\n\n01:41:20.940 --> 01:41:23.940\nIf she wants to go in there, can I use my amulet of magic?\n\n01:41:23.940 --> 01:41:25.940\nNo, no, my amulet.\n\n01:41:25.940 --> 01:41:28.940\nMy magic circle against evil offered to her\n\n01:41:28.940 --> 01:41:30.940\nor protect her in some way with that.\n\n01:41:30.940 --> 01:41:33.940\nYou can, but it's like centered on you.\n\n01:41:33.940 --> 01:41:35.940\nAnd since you can't fit in that room,\n\n01:41:35.940 --> 01:41:37.940\nit won't help very much.\n\n01:41:37.940 --> 01:41:39.940\nGentlemen, if you guys want to die.\n\n01:41:39.940 --> 01:41:41.940\nGentlemen, I call a roundup.\n\n01:41:41.940 --> 01:41:43.940\nAll right.\n\n01:41:43.940 --> 01:41:45.940\nA roundup?\n\n01:41:45.940 --> 01:41:51.940\nAdventurers' code dictates no one can refuse a roundup call.\n\n01:41:51.940 --> 01:41:55.940\nAlso, there has to be a barbecue at some point.\n\n01:41:55.940 --> 01:41:57.940\nThere will be if we want to.\n\n01:41:57.940 --> 01:42:00.940\nI fashion an old-timey triangle and I ring a dinner bell.\n\n01:42:00.940 --> 01:42:03.940\nI present some beef.\n\n01:42:03.940 --> 01:42:05.940\nGentlemen.\n\n01:42:05.940 --> 01:42:07.940\nAre there buttermilk biscuits to eat?\n\n01:42:07.940 --> 01:42:09.940\nYes.\n\n01:42:09.940 --> 01:42:13.940\nRight now, I feel like we're a little aimless,\n\n01:42:13.940 --> 01:42:15.940\nbut I know that...\n\n01:42:15.940 --> 01:42:17.940\nThere's a dragon in the crack.\n\n01:42:17.940 --> 01:42:19.940\nI know that there's a dragon in the crack.\n\n01:42:19.940 --> 01:42:22.940\nI also know that recently baby plans were presented.\n\n01:42:22.940 --> 01:42:24.940\nWhat?\n\n01:42:24.940 --> 01:42:27.940\nRemember when we stole baby plans?\n\n01:42:27.940 --> 01:42:29.940\nAnd a baby robot.\n\n01:42:29.940 --> 01:42:31.940\nYeah, we have a baby robot.\n\n01:42:31.940 --> 01:42:34.940\nAnd maybe this is crazy.\n\n01:42:34.940 --> 01:42:36.940\nMaybe you'll also be on board.\n\n01:42:36.940 --> 01:42:39.940\nBut what if we made a town of babies?\n\n01:42:39.940 --> 01:42:41.940\nWhat?\n\n01:42:41.940 --> 01:42:43.940\nBecause we have nothing else going on.\n\n01:42:43.940 --> 01:42:45.940\nOr what is...\n\n01:42:45.940 --> 01:42:48.940\nI mean, or what's happening.\n\n01:42:48.940 --> 01:42:50.940\nBut imagine a town of babies.\n\n01:42:50.940 --> 01:42:52.940\nThere's a baker baby.\n\n01:42:52.940 --> 01:42:54.940\nI like that.\n\n01:42:54.940 --> 01:42:56.940\nI like that.\n\n01:42:56.940 --> 01:42:58.940\nCan I use this amulet of shadow whirling to see if there is one out there?\n\n01:42:58.940 --> 01:43:00.940\nIs that what that does?\n\n01:43:00.940 --> 01:43:02.940\nIt'll take you to the shadow world,\n\n01:43:02.940 --> 01:43:05.940\nbut you don't think there's a baby village there?\n\n01:43:05.940 --> 01:43:07.940\nWe'd make our own.\n\n01:43:07.940 --> 01:43:09.940\nI like the idea of settling down\n\n01:43:09.940 --> 01:43:13.940\nand creating for a change instead of destroying.\n\n01:43:13.940 --> 01:43:16.940\nWe've been through so much and we've hurt so many.\n\n01:43:16.940 --> 01:43:19.940\nI feel like this is a sleeping dragon.\n\n01:43:19.940 --> 01:43:21.940\nYou know that dragons have all kinds of loot?\n\n01:43:21.940 --> 01:43:23.940\nThey're always sitting on some sort of crazy treasure chest.\n\n01:43:23.940 --> 01:43:27.940\nJeff, there's a dragon in every crack.\n\n01:43:27.940 --> 01:43:29.940\nAnd there always will be.\n\n01:43:29.940 --> 01:43:32.940\nChris de Burgh, what do you think?\n\n01:43:32.940 --> 01:43:34.940\nI say we should get out of here.\n\n01:43:34.940 --> 01:43:36.940\nTo make a baby town?\n\n01:43:36.940 --> 01:43:38.940\nTo make a baby town!\n\n01:43:38.940 --> 01:43:41.940\nImagine an entire town of babies.\n\n01:43:41.940 --> 01:43:43.940\nThat do bioinformatics.\n\n01:43:43.940 --> 01:43:45.940\nAnd then granola.\n\n01:43:45.940 --> 01:43:47.940\nExactly.\n\n01:43:47.940 --> 01:43:50.940\nWe could add some dinosaurs.\n\n01:43:50.940 --> 01:43:52.940\nMaybe we make tall babies.\n\n01:43:52.940 --> 01:43:55.940\nThat's terrifying.\n\n01:43:55.940 --> 01:43:59.940\nNever mind. That's the worst idea I've ever had.\n\n01:43:59.940 --> 01:44:01.940\nThat's an awful idea.\n\n01:44:01.940 --> 01:44:04.940\nGiant babies, like the little bodies, but with long legs.\n\n01:44:04.940 --> 01:44:06.940\nAnd they're sophisticated.\n\n01:44:06.940 --> 01:44:08.940\nClose encounters.\n\n01:44:08.940 --> 01:44:11.940\nQuark, what if we tie a rope around you\n\n01:44:11.940 --> 01:44:13.940\nand let you go in the crack?\n\n01:44:13.940 --> 01:44:16.940\nYou go talk to the dragon.\n\n01:44:16.940 --> 01:44:18.940\nI'll yank you back.\n\n01:44:18.940 --> 01:44:20.940\nThe dragon in the crack.\n\n01:44:20.940 --> 01:44:21.940\nWhat?\n\n01:44:21.940 --> 01:44:23.940\nThe dragon in the crack.\n\n01:44:23.940 --> 01:44:26.940\nBecause I don't want you to be unhappy.\n\n01:44:26.940 --> 01:44:29.940\nDid you already know that he was evil?\n\n01:44:29.940 --> 01:44:31.940\nWe detected him.\n\n01:44:31.940 --> 01:44:34.940\nI want Chris de Burgh to come with me because he's the thief.\n\n01:44:34.940 --> 01:44:37.940\nHe's the most stealthy among us.\n\n01:44:37.940 --> 01:44:39.940\nCan I fit?\n\n01:44:39.940 --> 01:44:41.940\nYeah.\n\n01:44:41.940 --> 01:44:43.940\nEverybody in each room can fit.\n\n01:44:43.940 --> 01:44:46.940\nI crawl back through the crack.\n\n01:44:46.940 --> 01:44:49.940\nI just poke my head around and see what else I see beside a sleeping dragon.\n\n01:44:49.940 --> 01:44:51.940\nYou'd see pretty much nothing else.\n\n01:44:51.940 --> 01:44:55.940\nIt's otherwise a barren cavern that has no other exits or entrances.\n\n01:44:55.940 --> 01:44:58.940\nAnd there's nothing that looks like a treasure chest or anything sexy?\n\n01:44:58.940 --> 01:45:00.940\nNot even a little.\n\n01:45:00.940 --> 01:45:02.940\nYou guys see a treasure chest or anything?\n\n01:45:02.940 --> 01:45:04.940\nI'm kidding, I don't really do that.\n\n01:45:04.940 --> 01:45:07.940\nI crawl back through the crack and go, Jesus Christ, keep it down.\n\n01:45:07.940 --> 01:45:09.940\nAll right.\n\n01:45:09.940 --> 01:45:11.940\nI say, all right, look, you're right.\n\n01:45:11.940 --> 01:45:13.940\nThere's only a diamond in the crack.\n\n01:45:13.940 --> 01:45:15.940\nSunroof top.\n\n01:45:15.940 --> 01:45:17.940\nDig in the scene.\n\n01:45:17.940 --> 01:45:19.940\nWith the gang, surely.\n\n01:45:19.940 --> 01:45:21.940\nI didn't understand that reference.\n\n01:45:21.940 --> 01:45:23.940\nI didn't understand that reference.\n\n01:45:23.940 --> 01:45:25.940\nDragon in the crack.\n\n01:45:25.940 --> 01:45:33.940\nI'll bet you 10,000 flurbos, whatever the fucking currency is.\n\n01:45:33.940 --> 01:45:37.940\nYou don't have 10,000 flurbos.\n\n01:45:37.940 --> 01:45:40.940\nThat we go out of this purple cave.\n\n01:45:40.940 --> 01:45:44.940\nWe're going to find some settlement or township.\n\n01:45:44.940 --> 01:45:48.940\nAnd they're going to go, I'll give you a million flurbos.\n\n01:45:48.940 --> 01:45:50.940\nIf you kill that black dragon.\n\n01:45:50.940 --> 01:45:53.940\nAnd we're going to get to sleep, recharge our spells.\n\n01:45:53.940 --> 01:45:55.940\nWell, and that sounds like so much fun.\n\n01:45:59.940 --> 01:46:01.940\nWait, but you wanted to make a baby village.\n\n01:46:01.940 --> 01:46:03.940\nI'm trying to help you.\n\n01:46:03.940 --> 01:46:05.940\nYou also wanted to walk into the crack.\n\n01:46:05.940 --> 01:46:07.940\nWalk into the crack, motherfucker.\n\n01:46:07.940 --> 01:46:09.940\nWalk in.\n\n01:46:09.940 --> 01:46:11.940\nEveryone go in the crack.\n\n01:46:11.940 --> 01:46:13.940\nEveryone go in the crack.\n\n01:46:13.940 --> 01:46:15.940\nI walk in the crack, but I have the ropes.\n\n01:46:15.940 --> 01:46:17.940\nI do make a plan.\n\n01:46:17.940 --> 01:46:19.940\nI walk in the crack.\n\n01:46:19.940 --> 01:46:21.940\nI'm not going to fucking...\n\n01:46:21.940 --> 01:46:23.940\nAs a barbarian.\n\n01:46:23.940 --> 01:46:25.940\nAs a barbarian.\n\n01:46:25.940 --> 01:46:29.940\nI don't like that there's just dragons laying around doing nothing.\n\n01:46:29.940 --> 01:46:32.940\nI'm going to kill a dragon for no reason.\n\n01:46:32.940 --> 01:46:34.940\nBecause you know what?\n\n01:46:34.940 --> 01:46:37.940\nWe have become chaotic neutral, right?\n\n01:46:37.940 --> 01:46:39.940\nAt least.\n\n01:46:39.940 --> 01:46:41.940\nAt the very least.\n\n01:46:41.940 --> 01:46:43.940\nWe're chaotic.\n\n01:46:43.940 --> 01:46:46.940\nErin, Mulraine, go talk to the dragon.\n\n01:46:46.940 --> 01:46:51.940\nDo this Sesame Street level con game on him.\n\n01:46:51.940 --> 01:46:53.940\nAll right.\n\n01:46:53.940 --> 01:46:55.940\nWhere you literally said...\n\n01:46:55.940 --> 01:46:57.940\nSesame Street, because at least it's something.\n\n01:46:57.940 --> 01:47:00.940\nI go in there with Chris de Burgh.\n\n01:47:00.940 --> 01:47:04.940\nAs a gnome where I can kind of fit through the crack.\n\n01:47:04.940 --> 01:47:06.940\nAnd he's small enough to fit through the right Spencer.\n\n01:47:06.940 --> 01:47:09.940\nYeah, but I thought he wanted to get out of here.\n\n01:47:09.940 --> 01:47:11.940\nI say Chris de Burgh, we go in there.\n\n01:47:11.940 --> 01:47:14.940\nBecause I've never met a dragon\n\n01:47:14.940 --> 01:47:17.940\nthat didn't sit on some sort of fucking crazy treasure.\n\n01:47:17.940 --> 01:47:19.940\nAnd I'm easily swayed.\n\n01:47:19.940 --> 01:47:20.940\nWhat?\n\n01:47:20.940 --> 01:47:21.940\nLet's go.\n\n01:47:21.940 --> 01:47:22.940\nAll right.\n\n01:47:22.940 --> 01:47:23.940\nOh, she's in.\n\n01:47:23.940 --> 01:47:24.940\nYeah.\n\n01:47:24.940 --> 01:47:27.940\nPart of Bioinformatics is adaptation.\n\n01:47:29.940 --> 01:47:31.940\nWait, you're Chris de Burgh.\n\n01:47:31.940 --> 01:47:32.940\nYeah.\n\n01:47:32.940 --> 01:47:33.940\nYou're Tylenol.\n\n01:47:33.940 --> 01:47:34.940\nOkay, Chris de Burgh.\n\n01:47:34.940 --> 01:47:36.940\nAnd I'm too big to fit through the crack.\n\n01:47:36.940 --> 01:47:38.940\nYou can fit through the crack.\n\n01:47:38.940 --> 01:47:40.940\nI don't know where you got this.\n\n01:47:40.940 --> 01:47:42.940\nHey, Sharpey.\n\n01:47:42.940 --> 01:47:45.940\nHey, you can fit through the crack.\n\n01:47:45.940 --> 01:47:46.940\nI'm coming.\n\n01:47:46.940 --> 01:47:48.940\nI'm going to make a prediction.\n\n01:47:48.940 --> 01:47:49.940\nMetagaming.\n\n01:47:49.940 --> 01:47:52.940\nSpencer's wanted to kill us for three months.\n\n01:47:55.940 --> 01:47:58.940\nAnd we are walking into a six-foot hole\n\n01:47:58.940 --> 01:48:01.940\nand handing him a shovel.\n\n01:48:01.940 --> 01:48:04.940\nBecause he's ready to move on.\n\n01:48:04.940 --> 01:48:06.940\nYou've missed all the cracks before.\n\n01:48:06.940 --> 01:48:08.940\nYou just don't look in the mirror.\n\n01:48:08.940 --> 01:48:10.940\nI run inside.\n\n01:48:10.940 --> 01:48:13.940\nAre you saying all the fucking things that we've destroyed,\n\n01:48:13.940 --> 01:48:19.940\nall the travails that we've traversed,\n\n01:48:19.940 --> 01:48:23.940\nthat we can't kill one sleeping dragon?\n\n01:48:23.940 --> 01:48:24.940\nI'm scared.\n\n01:48:24.940 --> 01:48:25.940\nHalf asleep.\n\n01:48:25.940 --> 01:48:26.940\nScared of the black one.\n\n01:48:26.940 --> 01:48:29.940\nSo more rain runs in, right?\n\n01:48:29.940 --> 01:48:32.940\nI run in and I have big blood spatter on me\n\n01:48:32.940 --> 01:48:34.940\nand the ropes and everything.\n\n01:48:34.940 --> 01:48:40.940\nBut we're all just hanging back.\n\n01:48:40.940 --> 01:48:43.940\nDescribe the chamber, Spencer, that the dragon lives in.\n\n01:48:43.940 --> 01:48:47.940\nIt looks like a cave, roughly a kidney bean shaped\n\n01:48:47.940 --> 01:48:48.940\nin four plan.\n\n01:48:48.940 --> 01:48:49.940\nKidney bean shaped.\n\n01:48:49.940 --> 01:48:52.940\nOf course, the geography of a cave\n\n01:48:52.940 --> 01:48:55.940\nmakes its ceiling and walls be all weird shaped.\n\n01:48:55.940 --> 01:48:57.940\nWhere is the dragon in the bean?\n\n01:48:57.940 --> 01:49:03.940\nIt's in right in the bean's middle section.\n\n01:49:03.940 --> 01:49:07.940\nThat's not the best.\n\n01:49:07.940 --> 01:49:10.940\nThis is my favorite part of every...\n\n01:49:10.940 --> 01:49:13.940\nLet's all agree that while Mulraine does this,\n\n01:49:13.940 --> 01:49:16.940\nwe all are very near the exits.\n\n01:49:16.940 --> 01:49:19.940\nOr very near the popcorn machine.\n\n01:49:19.940 --> 01:49:21.940\nI'm just eating popcorn and watching.\n\n01:49:21.940 --> 01:49:23.940\nI'll show you.\n\n01:49:23.940 --> 01:49:25.940\nSo, yeah, you make those noises.\n\n01:49:25.940 --> 01:49:27.940\nIt's still seemingly asleep.\n\n01:49:27.940 --> 01:49:29.940\nIt's not really registering you right now.\n\n01:49:29.940 --> 01:49:31.940\nI lock up and I eat.\n\n01:49:31.940 --> 01:49:35.940\nI get closer to the exit.\n\n01:49:35.940 --> 01:49:40.940\nHe's asleep, so I poke around the room.\n\n01:49:40.940 --> 01:49:41.940\nAll right.\n\n01:49:41.940 --> 01:49:42.940\nYeah.\n\n01:49:42.940 --> 01:49:43.940\nShould I find anything?\n\n01:49:43.940 --> 01:49:44.940\nThere's really nothing else\n\n01:49:44.940 --> 01:49:47.940\nthan this dragon sitting on the stone platform.\n\n01:49:47.940 --> 01:49:50.940\nIs poking around a full move action?\n\n01:49:50.940 --> 01:49:51.940\nSure.\n\n01:49:51.940 --> 01:49:55.940\nI make a gasp.\n\n01:49:55.940 --> 01:49:56.940\nYou gasp?\n\n01:49:56.940 --> 01:49:59.940\nAnd I flop myself down in front of the black dragon.\n\n01:49:59.940 --> 01:50:01.940\nShe's trying to wake up this dragon.\n\n01:50:01.940 --> 01:50:06.940\nThe dragon stirs and slowly its long serpentine head\n\n01:50:06.940 --> 01:50:10.940\nlifts up off of its place on its front paws.\n\n01:50:10.940 --> 01:50:15.940\nI get all the way into the exit.\n\n01:50:15.940 --> 01:50:19.940\nI'm basically leaving.\n\n01:50:19.940 --> 01:50:22.940\nHey, so glad you're awake.\n\n01:50:22.940 --> 01:50:26.940\nJesus Christ.\n\n01:50:26.940 --> 01:50:29.940\nIt continues to stir and it starts to look at you\n\n01:50:29.940 --> 01:50:31.940\nlike half waking up, you know?\n\n01:50:31.940 --> 01:50:32.940\nOkay.\n\n01:50:32.940 --> 01:50:35.940\nHello.\n\n01:50:35.940 --> 01:50:36.940\nWow.\n\n01:50:36.940 --> 01:50:39.940\nGlad you're awake.\n\n01:50:39.940 --> 01:50:43.940\nThis has been a long journey for me.\n\n01:50:43.940 --> 01:50:45.940\nFrom point A to point B.\n\n01:50:45.940 --> 01:50:47.940\nPoint A being that I learned that you are the dragon\n\n01:50:47.940 --> 01:50:51.940\nthat's the best dragon who has the best ideas about everything.\n\n01:50:51.940 --> 01:50:53.940\nAnd point B being finally meeting you\n\n01:50:53.940 --> 01:50:58.940\nbecause there is a town that is coming for you\n\n01:50:58.940 --> 01:50:59.940\nand I am here to protect you.\n\n01:50:59.940 --> 01:51:01.940\nThey tied me up.\n\n01:51:01.940 --> 01:51:04.940\nThey cut me and don't look for the cuts,\n\n01:51:04.940 --> 01:51:09.940\nbut there was blood.\n\n01:51:09.940 --> 01:51:12.940\nI threw up a lot of blood and they took that blood\n\n01:51:12.940 --> 01:51:13.940\nand they spat it.\n\n01:51:13.940 --> 01:51:14.940\nThis is gross.\n\n01:51:14.940 --> 01:51:15.940\nYou don't want to hear this.\n\n01:51:15.940 --> 01:51:21.940\nBut what is happening?\n\n01:51:21.940 --> 01:51:24.940\nIt opens and closes its mouth a couple of times,\n\n01:51:24.940 --> 01:51:26.940\nrevealing its razor sharp jaws\n\n01:51:26.940 --> 01:51:31.940\nand you can see acid starting to bubble up in its mouth hole.\n\n01:51:31.940 --> 01:51:32.940\nI leave.\n\n01:51:32.940 --> 01:51:33.940\nWell, no, wait.\n\n01:51:33.940 --> 01:51:35.940\nThat happens to me when I sleep too.\n\n01:51:35.940 --> 01:51:37.940\nI actually...\n\n01:51:37.940 --> 01:51:39.940\nThat could be nothing.\n\n01:51:39.940 --> 01:51:40.940\nExactly.\n\n01:51:40.940 --> 01:51:44.940\nI would get mad too hearing about this town.\n\n01:51:44.940 --> 01:51:48.940\nI mean, my mouth is foaming thinking about this.\n\n01:51:48.940 --> 01:51:52.940\nBut I guess I'll get on your back and I'll ride you to victory.\n\n01:51:52.940 --> 01:51:55.940\nHow do we make this work?\n\n01:51:55.940 --> 01:51:57.940\nOr wear your diamonds?\n\n01:51:57.940 --> 01:52:00.940\nWhat's your story?\n\n01:52:00.940 --> 01:52:03.940\nI'm all the way outside the fucking cave.\n\n01:52:03.940 --> 01:52:06.940\nThe dragon roars ferociously so loud\n\n01:52:06.940 --> 01:52:09.940\nthat your ears are ringing and hurt\n\n01:52:09.940 --> 01:52:14.940\nand you feel bad about hearing that noise.\n\n01:52:14.940 --> 01:52:15.940\nSo loud is it?\n\n01:52:15.940 --> 01:52:19.940\nSo let's just talk differently.\n\n01:52:19.940 --> 01:52:22.940\nIf we can communicate differently.\n\n01:52:22.940 --> 01:52:26.940\nAre we cool?\n\n01:52:26.940 --> 01:52:30.940\nIt just continues to look at you after...\n\n01:52:30.940 --> 01:52:31.940\nWhat was it?\n\n01:52:31.940 --> 01:52:32.940\nRoaring?\n\n01:52:32.940 --> 01:52:33.940\nIt did, right?\n\n01:52:33.940 --> 01:52:35.940\nAfter roaring and you see,\n\n01:52:35.940 --> 01:52:39.940\nmaybe where the tonsils would be on its throat,\n\n01:52:39.940 --> 01:52:44.940\nthey start to bulge up like maybe like a toad's sack.\n\n01:52:44.940 --> 01:52:47.940\nSo I run out through the crack.\n\n01:52:47.940 --> 01:52:49.940\nWhat the fuck?\n\n01:52:49.940 --> 01:52:51.940\nLet's get out of here!\n\n01:52:51.940 --> 01:52:52.940\nMe first!\n\n01:52:52.940 --> 01:52:53.940\nLet's get out of here!\n\n01:52:53.940 --> 01:52:55.940\nEverybody on my back.\n\n01:52:55.940 --> 01:52:58.940\nEverybody on my back.\n\n01:52:58.940 --> 01:53:02.940\nYou fucking asshole!\n\n01:53:02.940 --> 01:53:06.940\nI'm riding everybody out of there while this argument's going on.\n\n01:53:06.940 --> 01:53:08.940\nSorry guys, I...\n\n01:53:08.940 --> 01:53:11.940\nYou know, we all messed up sometimes.\n\n01:53:11.940 --> 01:53:16.940\nYeah, but sometimes everyone's telling you don't misstep.\n\n01:53:16.940 --> 01:53:18.940\nAnd then you're like, no, for real.\n\n01:53:18.940 --> 01:53:20.940\nSomeone has to go in there.\n\n01:53:20.940 --> 01:53:22.940\nAlthough everybody wanted to go in that fucking crack.\n\n01:53:22.940 --> 01:53:24.940\nI wanted to sneak in there.\n\n01:53:24.940 --> 01:53:26.940\nI didn't want to go wake him up.\n\n01:53:26.940 --> 01:53:28.940\nI didn't want to go...\n\n01:53:28.940 --> 01:53:33.940\nCome on, you all wanted your crack and you all got it.\n\n01:53:33.940 --> 01:53:36.940\nI alone wanted to run first.\n\n01:53:36.940 --> 01:53:38.940\nIt would have saved us 20 minutes of game time.\n\n01:53:38.940 --> 01:53:41.940\nI would have gone on there with Chris de Burgh and we would have gone in there\n\n01:53:41.940 --> 01:53:44.940\nand while he was asleep we would have sneaked in there and tried to rob him.\n\n01:53:44.940 --> 01:53:46.940\nLike burglars.\n\n01:53:46.940 --> 01:53:50.940\nTo the baby village!\n\n01:53:50.940 --> 01:53:55.940\nSo you ride out of these purple caverns and you can't really see for a moment the light.\n\n01:53:55.940 --> 01:54:00.940\nIt's blinding you, but the first thing you see in the sky is a large black shape.\n\n01:54:00.940 --> 01:54:03.940\nIt's floating towards you.\n\n01:54:03.940 --> 01:54:05.940\nHe's pulling us over.\n\n01:54:05.940 --> 01:54:08.940\nOh, no.\n\n01:54:08.940 --> 01:54:10.940\nYeah, sure.\n\n01:54:10.940 --> 01:54:12.940\nWhat is the shape that I mentioned?\n\n01:54:12.940 --> 01:54:14.940\nI'm not sure.\n\n01:54:14.940 --> 01:54:16.940\nIt's black and silver.\n\n01:54:16.940 --> 01:54:19.940\nIt looks like a zeppelin.\n\n01:54:19.940 --> 01:54:22.940\nYou see the markings on the zeppelin.\n\n01:54:22.940 --> 01:54:25.940\nIt seems to be the markings of Admiral Darkstar.\n\n01:54:25.940 --> 01:54:29.940\nThe zeppelin is heading directly towards you incredibly quickly.\n\n01:54:29.940 --> 01:54:33.940\nIt appears to be on a crash course with your direct location.\n\n01:54:33.940 --> 01:54:36.940\nWell, Tylenol, evasive...\n\n01:54:36.940 --> 01:54:38.940\nCan I take evasive action?\n\n01:54:38.940 --> 01:54:41.940\nYou take evasive action!\n\n01:54:41.940 --> 01:54:44.940\nYou do so with such grace and alacrity!\n\n01:54:44.940 --> 01:54:47.940\nOr maybe not.\n\n01:54:47.940 --> 01:54:50.940\nWith such grace and alacrity!\n\n01:54:50.940 --> 01:54:55.940\nRight as the zeppelin goes crashing into the purple wall of the purple canyon\n\n01:54:55.940 --> 01:54:59.940\nand it explodes in a great fireball you dodge out of the way\n\n01:54:59.940 --> 01:55:03.940\nand a crumple hole falls to the ground with a clunk.\n\n01:55:03.940 --> 01:55:09.940\nAnd you see three flaming goblins screaming and running out of the hole of this ship.\n\n01:55:09.940 --> 01:55:11.940\nAway from us the tortoise.\n\n01:55:11.940 --> 01:55:13.940\nAnd they're goblins. There's three of them.\n\n01:55:13.940 --> 01:55:17.940\nThey're stop-dropping and rolling to try and put out the fire on their bodies,\n\n01:55:17.940 --> 01:55:20.940\nbut it's not extinguishing.\n\n01:55:20.940 --> 01:55:22.940\nThey were just going to ram us with a zeppelin?\n\n01:55:22.940 --> 01:55:24.940\nWho knows, man.\n\n01:55:24.940 --> 01:55:27.940\nMulraine, take some arrows and shoot those guys down.\n\n01:55:27.940 --> 01:55:29.940\nI draw two arrows.\n\n01:55:29.940 --> 01:55:30.940\nYes.\n\n01:55:30.940 --> 01:55:32.940\nAnd I... at the drone?\n\n01:55:32.940 --> 01:55:33.940\nAt the goblins.\n\n01:55:33.940 --> 01:55:35.940\nAt the goblins. Oh, but they're hurt already.\n\n01:55:35.940 --> 01:55:38.940\nBut they're just like the people in the Hindenburg.\n\n01:55:38.940 --> 01:55:39.940\nKill them.\n\n01:55:39.940 --> 01:55:41.940\nYou know, I don't think I'm...\n\n01:55:41.940 --> 01:55:45.940\nThey're goblins on Admiral Darkstar's ship. They're not here to help.\n\n01:55:45.940 --> 01:55:46.940\nThey're dying.\n\n01:55:46.940 --> 01:55:48.940\nI don't think I'm chaotic.\n\n01:55:48.940 --> 01:55:51.940\nI'm not chaotic good anymore. I take out my cutlass\n\n01:55:51.940 --> 01:55:55.940\nand I start running towards them.\n\n01:55:55.940 --> 01:55:58.940\nRunning? We're on a flying fucking...\n\n01:55:58.940 --> 01:55:59.940\nHe doesn't fly.\n\n01:55:59.940 --> 01:56:01.940\nHe doesn't fly. He doesn't fly.\n\n01:56:01.940 --> 01:56:02.940\nHe's not a pegasus.\n\n01:56:02.940 --> 01:56:03.940\nI jump off of him.\n\n01:56:03.940 --> 01:56:07.940\nCan I activate my circle of... my circle against Evil?\n\n01:56:07.940 --> 01:56:08.940\nSure, that happens.\n\n01:56:08.940 --> 01:56:10.940\nBut you're standing still, right?\n\n01:56:10.940 --> 01:56:11.940\nNow?\n\n01:56:11.940 --> 01:56:12.940\nOh, she's off me now?\n\n01:56:12.940 --> 01:56:14.940\nWell, she was running towards it with the cost, I think.\n\n01:56:14.940 --> 01:56:16.940\nWell, I'm safe.\n\n01:56:16.940 --> 01:56:18.940\nOkay.\n\n01:56:18.940 --> 01:56:19.940\nYeah, you are safe.\n\n01:56:19.940 --> 01:56:20.940\nHow long can I run alongside her?\n\n01:56:20.940 --> 01:56:22.940\nI don't think I can jump back on her.\n\n01:56:22.940 --> 01:56:24.940\nAll right. You're on him.\n\n01:56:24.940 --> 01:56:26.940\nAnd now I'm riding toward the goblins,\n\n01:56:26.940 --> 01:56:29.940\nhaving activated the circle against Evil.\n\n01:56:29.940 --> 01:56:30.940\nAll right.\n\n01:56:30.940 --> 01:56:31.940\nThis happens.\n\n01:56:31.940 --> 01:56:33.940\nYou approach the goblins with your circle,\n\n01:56:33.940 --> 01:56:35.940\nand your circle engulfs the goblins,\n\n01:56:35.940 --> 01:56:38.940\nand the goblins are not bothered somehow,\n\n01:56:38.940 --> 01:56:41.940\nyet still their flesh burns.\n\n01:56:41.940 --> 01:56:43.940\nCan I use multi-attack on them?\n\n01:56:43.940 --> 01:56:46.940\nSure, you know.\n\n01:56:46.940 --> 01:56:47.940\nLet's do it.\n\n01:56:47.940 --> 01:56:49.940\nSo I use multi-attack on them.\n\n01:56:49.940 --> 01:56:53.940\nYou stab one directly in the eye with your forehead.\n\n01:56:53.940 --> 01:56:56.940\nI mean, the horn on them.\n\n01:56:56.940 --> 01:57:00.940\nI use my whisper bow to shoot out the other one.\n\n01:57:00.940 --> 01:57:01.940\nAll right.\n\n01:57:01.940 --> 01:57:03.940\nWhat are we doing?\n\n01:57:03.940 --> 01:57:07.940\nIt's like we're the G.E.A. outside of Waco,\n\n01:57:07.940 --> 01:57:12.940\nlike just picking off fucking fleeing Davidians.\n\n01:57:12.940 --> 01:57:13.940\nWhat are we doing?\n\n01:57:13.940 --> 01:57:15.940\nLet's just get out of here.\n\n01:57:15.940 --> 01:57:19.940\nWell, they tried to ram us with a zeppelin that they missed.\n\n01:57:19.940 --> 01:57:24.940\nWell, yeah, the karma has been wrought on them.\n\n01:57:24.940 --> 01:57:27.940\nWith the multi-attack, you stab the guy in the eye,\n\n01:57:27.940 --> 01:57:28.940\nand he dies.\n\n01:57:28.940 --> 01:57:30.940\nThe other guy, you stomp on his head with your hoof,\n\n01:57:30.940 --> 01:57:31.940\nand his head pops.\n\n01:57:31.940 --> 01:57:32.940\nJesus.\n\n01:57:32.940 --> 01:57:34.940\nGod almighty.\n\n01:57:34.940 --> 01:57:37.940\nThere's one flaming goblin remaining.\n\n01:57:37.940 --> 01:57:41.940\nOkay, I go up, I run to the last flaming goblin,\n\n01:57:41.940 --> 01:57:43.940\nI take my water skin out, and I douse him,\n\n01:57:43.940 --> 01:57:46.940\nand try to save him, just to ask him some questions.\n\n01:57:46.940 --> 01:57:49.940\nYou douse him in the water, and his fire goes out,\n\n01:57:49.940 --> 01:57:52.940\nbut then it comes back, and he's on fire again.\n\n01:57:52.940 --> 01:57:54.940\nI piss on him.\n\n01:57:54.940 --> 01:57:55.940\nAll right.\n\n01:57:55.940 --> 01:57:58.940\nIt extinguishes the fire, and then it comes back.\n\n01:57:58.940 --> 01:58:01.940\nI blow him out like a birthday candle.\n\n01:58:01.940 --> 01:58:04.940\nNothing happens that time, but I'm doing all this.\n\n01:58:04.940 --> 01:58:07.940\nHe stops rolling on the ground, and he sits up,\n\n01:58:07.940 --> 01:58:08.940\nand he's like, what?\n\n01:58:08.940 --> 01:58:12.940\nI guess I'm okay, but I'm on fire.\n\n01:58:12.940 --> 01:58:14.940\nScorching, no, I'm sorry,\n\n01:58:14.940 --> 01:58:17.940\nit's a spray of frost to see if it puts out the fire.\n\n01:58:17.940 --> 01:58:19.940\nIt burns, he's like, ah, ah, ah.\n\n01:58:19.940 --> 01:58:20.940\nYeah, I know, but...\n\n01:58:20.940 --> 01:58:22.940\nYou're not on fire anymore.\n\n01:58:22.940 --> 01:58:23.940\nI still am, though.\n\n01:58:23.940 --> 01:58:25.940\nHe likes being on fire, he's okay being on fire.\n\n01:58:25.940 --> 01:58:27.940\nYou like being on fire?\n\n01:58:27.940 --> 01:58:32.940\nI mean, I don't like it, but it's, I guess, fine.\n\n01:58:32.940 --> 01:58:33.940\nI'm not dead.\n\n01:58:33.940 --> 01:58:34.940\nHe's okay.\n\n01:58:34.940 --> 01:58:35.940\nWe're asking questions.\n\n01:58:35.940 --> 01:58:36.940\nWe've never gone this long.\n\n01:58:36.940 --> 01:58:38.940\nWe gotta figure out a way to...\n\n01:58:38.940 --> 01:58:41.940\nI tried to, I wanted to kill everybody.\n\n01:58:41.940 --> 01:58:43.940\nI wanted to fight a dragon.\n\n01:58:43.940 --> 01:58:45.940\nI want to placate every goblin and dragon you ever met.\n\n01:58:45.940 --> 01:58:47.940\nI wanted to leave.\n\n01:58:47.940 --> 01:58:51.940\nI wanted to leave, and it's been recorded.\n\n01:58:51.940 --> 01:58:56.940\nThen talk to this goblin who almost tried to kill us,\n\n01:58:56.940 --> 01:58:59.940\nor at least was a passenger on a sepulon.\n\n01:58:59.940 --> 01:59:02.940\nHe's on fire, doesn't hate it.\n\n01:59:02.940 --> 01:59:03.940\nWe can't put it on.\n\n01:59:03.940 --> 01:59:05.940\nYeah, putting him out doesn't work.\n\n01:59:05.940 --> 01:59:07.940\nCan I stuff him in the bag of holding?\n\n01:59:07.940 --> 01:59:08.940\nYep.\n\n01:59:08.940 --> 01:59:11.940\nI stuff him in the bag of holding.\n\n01:59:11.940 --> 01:59:13.940\nAnd I go, like, there's a lot of shit in there.\n\n01:59:13.940 --> 01:59:15.940\nLike, a lot of it might be worth something,\n\n01:59:15.940 --> 01:59:19.940\nbut you're gonna get waterboarded later.\n\n01:59:19.940 --> 01:59:23.940\nEnhanced, interrogated.\n\n01:59:23.940 --> 01:59:26.940\nIs there anything else on the sepulon that survives?\n\n01:59:26.940 --> 01:59:29.940\nI mean, it's about 20 feet off.\n\n01:59:29.940 --> 01:59:30.940\nI go to the sepulon.\n\n01:59:30.940 --> 01:59:33.940\nYou go to the sepulon.\n\n01:59:33.940 --> 01:59:35.940\nYou see a flaming sack.\n\n01:59:35.940 --> 01:59:41.940\nYeah.\n\n01:59:41.940 --> 01:59:43.940\nI look, I examine the flaming sack.\n\n01:59:43.940 --> 01:59:45.940\nIt burns, it burns apart before you,\n\n01:59:45.940 --> 01:59:49.940\nand you see small cloth and wooden goods being consumed,\n\n01:59:49.940 --> 01:59:53.940\nbut among them you see untarnished by the flames,\n\n01:59:53.940 --> 01:59:56.940\na crystalline disk of sorts.\n\n01:59:56.940 --> 01:59:59.940\nOh, I grabbed that disk, and I put it in the robot baby.\n\n01:59:59.940 --> 02:00:00.940\nYou do that.\n\n02:00:00.940 --> 02:00:01.940\nWhat?\n\n02:00:01.940 --> 02:00:02.940\nThe robot baby.\n\n02:00:02.940 --> 02:00:04.940\nAny round I'm holding?\n\n02:00:04.940 --> 02:00:07.940\nIt makes a crazy noise and starts vibrating,\n\n02:00:07.940 --> 02:00:09.940\nand then it goes, unit active.\n\n02:00:09.940 --> 02:00:11.940\nDiagnostic complete.\n\n02:00:11.940 --> 02:00:13.940\nBaby Phyllis!\n\n02:00:13.940 --> 02:00:16.940\nHey, hey, hey!\n\n02:00:16.940 --> 02:00:21.940\nBaby Phyllis!\n\n02:00:21.940 --> 02:00:23.940\nWe fucking did it.\n\n02:00:23.940 --> 02:00:27.940\nDeMarce Brown, everybody.\n\n02:00:27.940 --> 02:00:29.940\nMorgan, what's your last name?\n\n02:00:29.940 --> 02:00:30.940\nCarol?\n\n02:00:30.940 --> 02:00:32.940\nHarold.\n\n02:00:32.940 --> 02:00:34.940\nMorgan Harold?\n\n02:00:34.940 --> 02:00:36.940\nColsonette, Morgan Harold, everybody.\n\n02:00:36.940 --> 02:00:40.940\nErin McGathy, Spencer
