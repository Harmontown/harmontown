00:00.000 --> 00:25.860
This is for you Tommy Ramone.

00:25.860 --> 00:34.860
We lost our last Ramone, everybody.

00:34.860 --> 00:35.860
What in all?

00:35.860 --> 00:41.860
Welcome back to Meltdown Comics, the Nerd Milk Theater.

00:41.860 --> 00:53.860
Parment Town is now in session.

00:53.860 --> 01:02.860
Just in a moment, enjoying Tommy Ramone's drumming.

01:02.860 --> 01:03.860
What a good band.

01:03.860 --> 01:08.860
We lost all of the original members, but they will live forever in our hearts.

01:08.860 --> 01:17.860
On that note, welcome to the stage, the mayor of Parment Town, Mr. Dan Harmon.

01:17.860 --> 01:22.860
Thank you.

01:22.860 --> 01:27.860
Hi Ramones.

01:27.860 --> 01:30.860
Yeah, did you ever see a movie called Rock and Roll High School?

01:30.860 --> 01:32.860
Yeah, from the 80s.

01:32.860 --> 01:35.860
The Ramones were kind of like heavily featured in that.

01:35.860 --> 01:40.860
PJ Souls character loves the Ramones, and she has a dream sequence where they're like,

01:40.860 --> 01:43.860
in her apartment, something, it's a cute movie.

01:43.860 --> 01:49.860
Anyways, PJ Souls was murdered by Michael Myers in the first Halloween movie, I believe.

01:49.860 --> 01:50.860
Is that right?

01:50.860 --> 01:51.860
I think so.

01:51.860 --> 01:58.860
That movie, which is one of Jamie Lee Curtis' improper teen friends, has promiscuous sex

01:58.860 --> 02:09.860
and suffers the fate that all young ladies do at the hands of a brazen metaphor for syphilis, Michael Myers.

02:09.860 --> 02:14.860
It's funny how horror movies, they don't really change that much in that one regard.

02:14.860 --> 02:22.860
The teen culture being put on trial, you still don't really see...

02:22.860 --> 02:28.860
That's basically all the horror movies that just continue to punish teens for the same crimes.

02:28.860 --> 02:29.860
For growing up.

02:29.860 --> 02:33.860
For experimenting, in any regard.

02:33.860 --> 02:35.860
For not doing their homework.

02:35.860 --> 02:37.860
For skinny dipping?

02:37.860 --> 02:43.860
Yeah, we just keep killing them for being young.

02:43.860 --> 02:48.860
Which was why Kevin Lewis was so awesome, because it kind of like concretized that mythology.

02:48.860 --> 02:54.860
Wow, I'm boring the fuck out of myself.

02:54.860 --> 02:58.860
I was standing on the front walk outside my house today.

02:58.860 --> 03:03.860
I invited Erin down to do the show, because I know Camille couldn't be here, and I had her,

03:03.860 --> 03:09.860
hey, what am I, chopped liver?

03:09.860 --> 03:14.860
The crowd was almost mutinous.

03:14.860 --> 03:20.860
He actually could do the show, I told him not to, because I don't like what's going on around here.

03:20.860 --> 03:24.860
You guys are getting a little too friendly.

03:24.860 --> 03:27.860
It's called Harmontown.

03:27.860 --> 03:29.860
I don't get paid to do this shit.

03:29.860 --> 03:31.860
Not Silicon Valley.

03:31.860 --> 03:35.860
Yeah, you can watch him on HBO, you love him so much.

03:35.860 --> 03:40.860
I love the image of him walking around in his underwear, looking for his Bruce Springsteen shirt.

03:40.860 --> 03:43.860
I've been thinking about that forever.

03:43.860 --> 03:45.860
That's a whole different story.

03:45.860 --> 03:48.860
Maybe I just love the image of him in his underwear.

03:48.860 --> 03:51.860
Maybe it doesn't matter what he's looking for.

03:51.860 --> 03:54.860
Maybe I don't like to think he's looking for me.

03:54.860 --> 04:01.860
So I was standing on the front walk, and Erin's coming down, Uber's in front.

04:01.860 --> 04:07.860
I still haven't gotten over my Uber addiction, no matter what they do to me.

04:07.860 --> 04:10.860
Erin's coming down, and I look back.

04:10.860 --> 04:15.860
It's a beautiful summer night in Los Angeles, and Erin's looking particularly beautiful.

04:15.860 --> 04:23.860
We've been doing couples therapy, so I feel like I'm becoming a better lover.

04:23.860 --> 04:26.860
Mentally, not physically.

04:26.860 --> 04:28.860
I look back.

04:28.860 --> 04:33.860
Physically, you just picture Camille in his Bruce Springsteen shirt.

04:33.860 --> 04:40.860
I look back as she comes down the DreamWorks flagstone walkway that I have outside my house.

04:40.860 --> 04:42.860
I call it DreamWorks Flagstone.

04:42.860 --> 04:45.860
It's a certain aesthetic.

04:45.860 --> 04:48.860
And what you guys don't...

04:48.860 --> 04:51.860
You don't go to DreamWorks?

04:51.860 --> 04:57.860
That brick they use.

04:57.860 --> 05:06.860
Based on how many people were in that building, I assume half of you directed Kung Fu Panda.

05:06.860 --> 05:10.860
So she's halfway down, and I'm just taken with her beauty.

05:10.860 --> 05:13.860
She's framed against a beautiful Los Angeles summer night.

05:13.860 --> 05:19.860
A smile creeps across my face as I'm watching her float down the walkway towards me,

05:19.860 --> 05:25.860
thinking about how in love with her I am and how lucky I am to be getting to spend the rest of my life with her.

05:25.860 --> 05:30.860
And she stops and she looks at me, looking at her that way, and she goes,

05:30.860 --> 05:35.860
Are you farting?

05:35.860 --> 05:39.860
I want to know what love is.

05:39.860 --> 05:43.860
Will you show me?

05:43.860 --> 05:44.860
Yeah.

05:44.860 --> 05:47.860
Dan, were you farting?

05:47.860 --> 05:48.860
It was not.

05:48.860 --> 05:51.860
Because those two concepts aren't mutually exclusive.

05:51.860 --> 05:56.860
You could have been watching her float down the DreamWorks Flagstone and be farting at the same time.

05:56.860 --> 06:02.860
We learned in couples therapy the proper structure of an apology, Jeff.

06:02.860 --> 06:06.860
Apologies are not studied in contemporary society.

06:06.860 --> 06:11.860
There's one man out there in the psychology community that studies apology.

06:11.860 --> 06:15.860
The good ones, bad ones, fake ones.

06:15.860 --> 06:19.860
And the psychological community is always...

06:19.860 --> 06:21.860
He's a controversial figure.

06:21.860 --> 06:24.860
You might call him the Noam Chomsky of psychology.

06:24.860 --> 06:26.860
He's a lone gunman out there.

06:26.860 --> 06:28.860
Is this your therapist or your therapist is quoting this person?

06:28.860 --> 06:29.860
She's quoting this person.

06:29.860 --> 06:31.860
He wrote a book called, I don't know, On Apology.

06:31.860 --> 06:33.860
I think the book is called.

06:33.860 --> 06:35.860
She pulled it off her bookshelf and started reading from it,

06:35.860 --> 06:37.860
at which point I was like, what the fuck?

06:37.860 --> 06:40.860
Is this coming off my time?

06:40.860 --> 06:44.860
You're reading another guy's book out loud.

06:44.860 --> 06:46.860
This is insane.

06:46.860 --> 06:48.860
It's like Netflix therapy.

06:48.860 --> 06:50.860
I don't know what that means.

06:50.860 --> 06:52.860
It's just two buzzwords.

06:52.860 --> 06:54.860
Therapy's a buzzword.

06:54.860 --> 06:56.860
Shut up!

06:56.860 --> 07:00.860
Dreamworks Flagstones.

07:00.860 --> 07:02.860
Apologies, Jeff.

07:02.860 --> 07:04.860
They like a good story.

07:04.860 --> 07:06.860
Dan, will you tell me about apology structure?

07:06.860 --> 07:09.860
They have three parts to them.

07:09.860 --> 07:12.860
Apologies have three legs. It's like a tripod.

07:12.860 --> 07:16.860
A proper apology, one that makes a difference historically.

07:16.860 --> 07:18.860
His book is about the history of apologies.

07:18.860 --> 07:20.860
The ones that worked.

07:20.860 --> 07:22.860
What's the most famous apology?

07:22.860 --> 07:26.860
One of the most famous failed ones?

07:26.860 --> 07:27.860
Nixon.

07:27.860 --> 07:32.860
Nixon bothered to say, I'm really sorry if you guys feel like I'm a crook.

07:32.860 --> 07:34.860
So typically, we've all done that apology.

07:34.860 --> 07:36.860
I'm sorry if you feel that way.

07:36.860 --> 07:39.860
It's all on you. You're a fucking dumbass.

07:39.860 --> 07:43.860
I'm sorry if you have something wrong with you.

07:43.860 --> 07:45.860
I'm sorry I'm so impeachable.

07:45.860 --> 07:50.860
I can't remember a famous one that really made a huge difference.

07:50.860 --> 07:54.860
But historically, politically, if you examine situations where a wrong has been done

07:54.860 --> 08:00.860
and then someone tries to address it, there are historically examples of times when it works,

08:00.860 --> 08:02.860
times when it doesn't work.

08:02.860 --> 08:05.860
It's not scientific, but it's anecdotal.

08:05.860 --> 08:11.860
This guy posits that an apology has three parts to it.

08:11.860 --> 08:15.860
Part one, acknowledgement of the offense.

08:15.860 --> 08:18.860
So you say, Jeff, I'm sorry.

08:18.860 --> 08:21.860
I'm sorry, I spilled your water.

08:21.860 --> 08:22.860
Okay.

08:22.860 --> 08:25.860
You don't have to applaud for each thing.

08:25.860 --> 08:26.860
They didn't.

08:26.860 --> 08:29.860
Step two, one guy keeps crying.

08:29.860 --> 08:32.860
I don't know if there's a mosquito.

08:32.860 --> 08:38.860
If he's trying to start the world's slowest, slow clap.

08:38.860 --> 08:42.860
The second leg of the tripod is remorse.

08:42.860 --> 08:44.860
You got to actually feel bad.

08:44.860 --> 08:47.860
You got to actually communicate the shame that you feel,

08:47.860 --> 08:49.860
the remorse you feel about the thing you did wrong.

08:49.860 --> 08:51.860
And the third thing, a commitment to change.

08:51.860 --> 08:53.860
Okay, so all three things.

08:53.860 --> 08:55.860
So, Dan, let's say you spilled my water.

08:55.860 --> 08:59.860
And how would you apologize using that tripod?

08:59.860 --> 09:01.860
Jeff, I'm sorry that I spilled your water.

09:01.860 --> 09:04.860
I feel terrible that I spilled your water.

09:04.860 --> 09:06.860
I'm never going to spill your water again.

09:06.860 --> 09:12.860
Perfect apology.

09:12.860 --> 09:15.860
Now, what if you're being asked in a relationship to apologize

09:15.860 --> 09:21.860
for something that maybe you feel like it was a two-way street?

09:21.860 --> 09:23.860
Well, that's that you just take turns.

09:23.860 --> 09:25.860
I got Aaron.

09:25.860 --> 09:28.860
I'm sorry that I came drunk into the bedroom.

09:28.860 --> 09:34.860
Nothing but my underwear holding my pot box that you filled with

09:34.860 --> 09:38.860
charades paper from your party

09:38.860 --> 09:42.860
and having dumped out all my paraphernalia

09:42.860 --> 09:48.860
and brandished it about like a stone savage going,

09:48.860 --> 09:52.860
you don't respect my property.

09:52.860 --> 09:55.860
I'm sorry I did that.

09:55.860 --> 09:57.860
I'm sorry I shamed you.

09:57.860 --> 09:59.860
I'm sorry I made you feel ashamed.

09:59.860 --> 10:03.860
I feel terrible about it because it makes me feel like I've become my dad.

10:03.860 --> 10:06.860
And you know what?

10:06.860 --> 10:11.860
I'm going to try to figure out a way to be drunk and accountable.

10:11.860 --> 10:21.860
And if that fails, then we'll have to start doing the hard stuff.

10:21.860 --> 10:23.860
What is that?

10:23.860 --> 10:26.860
Well, if I can't be a good person when I'm drunk,

10:26.860 --> 10:29.860
then of course you've got to become one of those people.

10:29.860 --> 10:32.860
Wait, what are you talking about?

10:32.860 --> 10:40.860
The Jason Robards people, it's been 30 days and I'm so proud of myself people.

10:40.860 --> 10:42.860
Sober.

10:42.860 --> 10:47.860
Quitters, yeah.

10:47.860 --> 10:50.860
I don't want to talk about it.

10:50.860 --> 10:54.860
Let's just hope I get my shit together while drunk.

10:54.860 --> 10:59.860
So yeah, that's it.

10:59.860 --> 11:03.860
Now that would be the greatest thing in the world to be at the world's best drunk.

11:03.860 --> 11:05.860
It's called functional alcoholism.

11:05.860 --> 11:11.860
I've got it nailed down in every aspect of my life except for when Aaron and I have a couple to do.

11:11.860 --> 11:13.860
When Aaron loses your weed?

11:13.860 --> 11:16.860
Yeah, whenever.

11:16.860 --> 11:18.860
I mean, I don't know.

11:18.860 --> 11:23.860
I'm a bad person when I drink sometimes with my lovers.

11:23.860 --> 11:25.860
It's not good.

11:25.860 --> 11:35.860
I have to carry it like a rabbit's foot or something and rub it and go like, knock it off, dad.

11:35.860 --> 11:43.860
Or like a locket with a picture of my dad in it, like open it up and go like, I'm not you, man.

11:43.860 --> 11:50.860
And then on the other side is a picture of my mom and I go like, why did you henpeck him so much?

11:50.860 --> 11:53.860
It wasn't just the booze.

11:53.860 --> 11:55.860
I'm gonna close it.

11:55.860 --> 11:58.860
Maybe reacting like that for it doesn't make a lot of sense.

11:58.860 --> 12:01.860
Because they're worried.

12:01.860 --> 12:03.860
About my parents?

12:03.860 --> 12:05.860
No, about you.

12:05.860 --> 12:10.860
I'm 41, I mean, I'm gonna, you know, what?

12:10.860 --> 12:12.860
Well, exactly, what?

12:12.860 --> 12:15.860
I mean, what?

12:15.860 --> 12:18.860
I'm 41, what?

12:18.860 --> 12:21.860
Are you saying it's too late to adapt?

12:21.860 --> 12:24.860
I just finished explaining that I'm gonna try to make some changes.

12:24.860 --> 12:26.860
It's a commitment to change.

12:26.860 --> 12:31.860
You said you wished you had a rabbit's foot, that was on one side with your father,

12:31.860 --> 12:35.860
and the other side with your mother and you blamed her for your father being like he was.

12:35.860 --> 12:38.860
Well, they can't all be gems.

12:38.860 --> 12:41.860
Also, I've been drinking a little.

12:41.860 --> 12:48.860
I suppose maybe that's why my commitment to change got a little warbly.

12:48.860 --> 12:51.860
Sports Corner!

12:57.860 --> 13:04.860
It's a world of sports and Dan Harmon, there's a fan of him all, all, all, all, all, all.

13:04.860 --> 13:10.860
Dan, today the World Cup came to its beautiful climax.

13:10.860 --> 13:12.860
The finals happened today.

13:12.860 --> 13:17.860
Obviously, I would be at full to not know that.

13:17.860 --> 13:22.860
Top of your head, give me some, just throw some headlines at me for you.

13:22.860 --> 13:30.860
It's all over, it's finally over, the World Cup only happens every once in a while.

13:30.860 --> 13:34.860
It's, it's not annually.

13:34.860 --> 13:37.860
No.

13:37.860 --> 13:43.860
For those of you dumbasses who thought it was, this is a bigger deal, it's like the Olympics.

13:43.860 --> 13:49.860
What would you say, I mean, what year, in 2014, where we're living now,

13:49.860 --> 13:53.860
what year do you project the next World Cup with me?

13:53.860 --> 13:59.860
Well, it's not, I mean, it's like the Olympics.

13:59.860 --> 14:02.860
So, four years from now.

14:06.860 --> 14:11.860
So, I mean, and what an ending to what a World Cup.

14:11.860 --> 14:16.860
This is the first time that I've ever said this about a World Cup.

14:16.860 --> 14:20.860
Anything you say right now would be the first time you said this about a World Cup.

14:20.860 --> 14:25.860
I'm gonna, I would call it a world mug.

14:25.860 --> 14:27.860
Like it was that good.

14:27.860 --> 14:29.860
Bit, bit, bit, booming.

14:29.860 --> 14:31.860
You mean bigger than a cup.

14:31.860 --> 14:35.860
Yeah, like, and more intimate.

14:35.860 --> 14:40.860
Prouder, something that said World's greatest grandpa World Cup on it.

14:40.860 --> 14:43.860
Do you feel the best team won today, Dan, in the finals?

14:43.860 --> 14:48.860
Well, I mean, obviously, Jeff, in the technical sense, the reason for the sports,

14:48.860 --> 14:55.860
various scorekeeping mechanisms is to determine who won, and who is therefore the best team.

14:55.860 --> 14:58.860
Do I feel the best team won?

14:58.860 --> 15:02.860
I mean, sometimes it can come down to penalty kicks, or it can come down to just defense,

15:02.860 --> 15:04.860
and people like, do you feel like...

15:04.860 --> 15:07.860
That's all part of the sport, Jeff, all those things.

15:07.860 --> 15:11.860
I guess my question is, who won today, Dan?

15:11.860 --> 15:21.860
Well, I mean, we all know who won today, but I will say I was shocked that they did win.

15:21.860 --> 15:22.860
I was shocked that they won.

15:22.860 --> 15:23.860
Why is that?

15:23.860 --> 15:33.860
Well, because you don't really associate that country with flat land,

15:33.860 --> 15:41.860
which soccer is on a flat field, and this is a very mountainous country.

15:41.860 --> 15:43.860
What kind of terrain?

15:43.860 --> 15:49.860
I mean, it's a large country that includes mountainous terrain.

15:49.860 --> 15:50.860
Exactly.

15:50.860 --> 15:54.860
So you'd expect them to be worse at soccer than the other team.

15:54.860 --> 16:03.860
Now, Dan, it's the first time a European team played and won a World Cup on American soil.

16:03.860 --> 16:07.860
Yeah.

16:07.860 --> 16:08.860
I can't believe it.

16:08.860 --> 16:10.860
I can't believe...

16:10.860 --> 16:14.860
I can't believe Germany won.

16:14.860 --> 16:15.860
Is that a guess?

16:15.860 --> 16:16.860
Yeah.

16:16.860 --> 16:18.860
You're right.

16:18.860 --> 16:22.860
I'm a fucking sport head.

16:22.860 --> 16:25.860
Dan, what do you mean is that a guess?

16:25.860 --> 16:27.860
Well, I'll follow up that question.

16:27.860 --> 16:29.860
Who did they beat?

16:29.860 --> 16:31.860
Well, they were on American soil.

16:31.860 --> 16:32.860
Yes.

16:32.860 --> 16:40.860
And as we all know in soccer, you don't just play another team on another country's soil, right?

16:40.860 --> 16:44.860
It's not like one country hosts for two other countries.

16:44.860 --> 16:47.860
Brazil was the host nation, but Brazil got knocked out by Germany.

16:47.860 --> 16:57.860
And ignominiously, they got killed in 7-1, the worst defeat, probably the most terrible feat in Brazil's World Cup history.

16:57.860 --> 17:06.860
So another South American team lost today.

17:06.860 --> 17:13.860
And tell me why you think they lost, and tell me what color their flag is.

17:13.860 --> 17:17.860
Look, I...

17:17.860 --> 17:19.860
Just name some primary colors.

17:19.860 --> 17:21.860
I think their flag has green in it.

17:21.860 --> 17:22.860
Nope.

17:22.860 --> 17:25.860
That's not a primary color.

17:25.860 --> 17:26.860
Primary...

17:26.860 --> 17:30.860
You got a 1-3 chance just to start off.

17:30.860 --> 17:31.860
Chile?

17:31.860 --> 17:33.860
No.

17:33.860 --> 17:38.860
Chile's not a primary color either.

17:38.860 --> 17:42.860
It's not red or yellow.

17:42.860 --> 17:44.860
Argentina.

17:44.860 --> 17:46.860
Yes!

17:46.860 --> 17:52.860
Argentina lost to Germany on American soil for the first time.

17:52.860 --> 17:55.860
That's why it was a world mug.

17:55.860 --> 17:56.860
Incredible.

17:56.860 --> 17:58.860
I can't wait till 2018.

17:58.860 --> 18:04.860
Now, everyone go back to remembering that you're not interested in soccer at all.

18:04.860 --> 18:11.860
Dan, what country do you think in four years' time will be the ascendant team that will shock us?

18:11.860 --> 18:22.860
Well, I think based on this quadra years' performances from all the teams, just observing,

18:22.860 --> 18:28.860
I felt like you're seeing a lot of foot action from France.

18:28.860 --> 18:30.860
Oh yeah, times.

18:30.860 --> 18:35.860
This is a country that knows about foot action.

18:35.860 --> 18:45.860
And I feel like they just didn't have the contiguous...

18:45.860 --> 18:49.860
Yeah.

18:49.860 --> 18:51.860
Sort of...

18:51.860 --> 18:53.860
Sorry, what's that?

18:53.860 --> 18:54.860
Contiguousness.

18:54.860 --> 18:56.860
Contiguousness.

18:56.860 --> 18:59.860
Yeah.

18:59.860 --> 19:02.860
But I think that four years will be contiguous.

19:02.860 --> 19:05.860
Combine that with their foot action, I think France...

19:05.860 --> 19:09.860
They'll be contiguous to other countries next to them, like Portugal or Spain?

19:09.860 --> 19:12.860
No, their foot action will be contiguous with each other.

19:12.860 --> 19:15.860
Like when one guy kicks the ball, the other guy will start kicking it again, too.

19:15.860 --> 19:18.860
I don't think any of them will use their hands.

19:18.860 --> 19:21.860
What you saw from France this year is they're very good with their feet,

19:21.860 --> 19:24.860
but then sometimes they use their hands and that's when they get into trouble.

19:24.860 --> 19:26.860
You're not supposed to use your hands in soccer.

19:26.860 --> 19:31.860
Dan, as I'm sure you know, famously a lot of European clubs

19:31.860 --> 19:32.860
went out early.

19:32.860 --> 19:36.860
We lost Portugal, England, Spain, France, Italy.

19:36.860 --> 19:38.860
They went out quite early.

19:38.860 --> 19:40.860
What would you say...

19:40.860 --> 19:45.860
If you were going to be the new coach, let's say, of England,

19:45.860 --> 19:50.860
what would you say to the youth teams that you're bringing up new talent?

19:50.860 --> 19:53.860
First of all, get out there.

19:53.860 --> 19:55.860
Use the grass.

19:55.860 --> 19:58.860
Don't fight the grass.

19:58.860 --> 20:03.860
Never stop running because the ball doesn't stop rolling.

20:03.860 --> 20:12.860
If your teammate is open, they kick the ball to him and box out the other team.

20:12.860 --> 20:17.860
Get in those defense zones and then make them into offense zones

20:17.860 --> 20:22.860
by moving them forward and crouch on the goalie and get in the hot boxes

20:22.860 --> 20:26.860
and cross-tether.

20:26.860 --> 20:28.860
Yeah, exactly.

20:28.860 --> 20:32.860
Now, Dan, when Germany ran over Brazil, the home nation,

20:32.860 --> 20:38.860
they scored what, five goals in the first 30 minutes maybe or something like that?

20:38.860 --> 20:41.860
It's 45 minutes in. It's 5-0.

20:41.860 --> 20:44.860
You're Brazil's coach.

20:44.860 --> 20:48.860
You're down five goals at halftime.

20:48.860 --> 20:52.860
What do you say to your team to rally them for the next 45 minutes

20:52.860 --> 20:57.860
and come out and turn it around or to at least salvage some sort of pride out of it?

20:57.860 --> 21:00.860
This is it.

21:00.860 --> 21:08.860
There's a bunch of dirt out there and we're not dirt.

21:08.860 --> 21:10.860
God brought us up out of it.

21:10.860 --> 21:15.860
Am I the German coach?

21:15.860 --> 21:18.860
Okay, well, let's do both.

21:18.860 --> 21:24.860
Germany's winning by five goals. You want to be German's coach?

21:24.860 --> 21:26.860
Yeah, I want to be the German coach.

21:26.860 --> 21:31.860
You're up five goals to know and you're playing on Brazilian soil

21:31.860 --> 21:38.860
and the crowd that was filled with 100,000 Brazilian zealots is now gone completely silent.

21:38.860 --> 21:41.860
You hear that sound?

21:41.860 --> 21:49.860
You hear door-himmels? That means friend.

21:49.860 --> 21:56.860
That's the sound of shame, our Teutonic legacy.

21:56.860 --> 21:58.860
We're entitled to this.

21:58.860 --> 22:07.860
We're entitled to a lot more than I'm not allowed to mention.

22:07.860 --> 22:15.980
And since receiving my new identity as a soccer coach, I have come to accept that we can gain

22:15.980 --> 22:18.100
territory on that field.

22:18.100 --> 22:23.900
I want you guys to go out there and annex the whole game.

22:23.900 --> 22:30.220
Yeah, okay, we're done with sports corner now.

22:30.220 --> 22:43.260
Sorry, German Harmontown fans, German Harmontown fans, they're like, yeah, yeah, yeah, we get

22:43.260 --> 22:44.260
it.

22:44.260 --> 22:45.260
They get it.

22:45.260 --> 22:46.260
Enough with the German jokes.

22:46.260 --> 22:47.260
We get it.

22:47.260 --> 22:48.260
We made it a oopsie.

22:48.260 --> 22:54.540
I mean, it was Germany versus Argentina and so there's a little complicity going on.

22:54.540 --> 23:00.420
You know that that game was determined, yeah, in the back room, like based on extradition.

23:00.420 --> 23:01.420
By Dr. Mengele?

23:01.420 --> 23:07.420
Yeah, like, oh, yeah, there's like, well, we'll give you three clones of his head.

23:07.420 --> 23:13.020
Wait, you think Argentina has Hitler's head cloned?

23:13.020 --> 23:17.540
I think a lot of places have Hitler's head cloned, bro.

23:17.540 --> 23:22.620
And you need to wake up and check your privilege.

23:22.620 --> 23:27.180
Hashtag was up.

23:27.180 --> 23:31.300
I heard somebody say today, they're talking about Facebook being intrusive and Facebook,

23:31.300 --> 23:33.940
like it's hard to delete your Facebook account.

23:33.940 --> 23:37.380
Someone said that the CIA might have given lots of money to Facebook.

23:37.380 --> 23:38.380
Is there any credence in that?

23:38.380 --> 23:39.380
Or is that just crazy?

23:39.380 --> 23:41.780
Well, the NSA, I mean, you could go online.

23:41.780 --> 23:42.780
It's fucking insane.

23:42.780 --> 23:45.820
The NSA did everything, like no one cares.

23:45.820 --> 23:47.620
I don't care.

23:47.620 --> 23:52.300
Like the NSA was all over the fucking place, I'm sure it concludes Facebook.

23:52.300 --> 23:53.300
They were funded?

23:53.300 --> 23:54.300
Like Facebook?

23:54.300 --> 23:55.300
Well, I don't know.

23:55.300 --> 23:59.420
Funded by, but they were absolutely complicit, like, I don't even, I mean, if somebody were

23:59.420 --> 24:00.420
to come up, then.

24:00.420 --> 24:02.420
Does anybody have any thoughts?

24:02.420 --> 24:06.700
It would turn into, I mean, we're talking about 25 minutes of somebody.

24:06.700 --> 24:14.860
That's how long it would take to finish listing the NSA's transgressions against its domestic

24:14.860 --> 24:20.580
citizens in the last 10 years, which have all come to light, thanks to a guy who's,

24:20.580 --> 24:22.580
you know, some people view as a traitor.

24:22.580 --> 24:27.260
On Saturday and Sunday on CNN, now they just air forensic files.

24:27.260 --> 24:30.140
Now they become like the history channel.

24:30.140 --> 24:34.860
And they just air forensic files where a guy goes, a woman was murdered and there was

24:34.860 --> 24:38.780
only a Q-tip on the ground.

24:38.780 --> 24:46.420
Would 10 years from now, would there be science to find out who her murderer was?

24:46.420 --> 24:51.980
The answer is yes, otherwise, no, there's going to be shows where they're going to find

24:51.980 --> 24:56.420
out there's a picture of a guy in the background and facial recognition of a dude in a Facebook

24:56.420 --> 24:57.420
site.

24:57.420 --> 24:59.980
Oh yeah, absolutely, because they've been storing this shit.

24:59.980 --> 25:03.740
The weird thing about the whistleblowing is that it's like this big brew-ha-ha, oh, you

25:03.740 --> 25:08.100
blew the whistle, you told on us for spying on American citizens, but nothing has changed.

25:08.100 --> 25:13.220
And then also, now that the whistle's blown exactly 10 years from now, that stuff's all

25:13.220 --> 25:19.340
admissible if, I mean, as long as you're kind of sort of connected to the concept of maybe

25:19.340 --> 25:25.140
the threat of perhaps being something to do with terrorism by someone's definition, 10

25:25.140 --> 25:28.420
years from now, let's not talk about it.

25:28.420 --> 25:32.780
There's going to be nine other podcasts all around us that do nothing but talk about it.

25:32.780 --> 25:33.780
I hope so.

25:33.780 --> 25:34.780
I don't know.

25:34.780 --> 25:40.780
You know, they were, they fucking, are you saying our podcast isn't a trenchant political

25:40.780 --> 25:41.780
podcast?

25:41.780 --> 25:44.660
It's certainly not well researched to me, yeah.

25:44.660 --> 25:48.140
Like, there's got to be a good podcast out there where somebody that does their homework

25:48.140 --> 25:50.740
and like, we'll talk about this stuff and I think everybody's not...

25:50.740 --> 25:51.740
No, there's true.

25:51.740 --> 25:52.740
There's not.

25:52.740 --> 25:57.220
I certainly, I certainly, like, my, my excuses work, like, ah, it was right in community.

25:57.220 --> 25:58.620
I like to make the nice people laugh.

25:58.620 --> 26:01.460
I don't know anything about them looking at us through our laptop cameras.

26:01.460 --> 26:03.100
Now you, you work for Yahoo now.

26:03.100 --> 26:04.100
Yeah.

26:04.100 --> 26:06.460
So when does that go on to production?

26:06.460 --> 26:08.020
I have to check with the CIA.

26:08.020 --> 26:09.020
I don't know.

26:09.020 --> 26:10.020
The CIA?

26:10.020 --> 26:12.900
Well, there's a different structure over there now.

26:12.900 --> 26:14.100
Yeah.

26:14.100 --> 26:18.700
I have to go through the industrial complex and then the military complex and then there's

26:18.700 --> 26:20.940
this third thing that's like a combination of them both.

26:20.940 --> 26:24.140
I can't remember the name.

26:24.140 --> 26:26.460
And then the funding comes through.

26:26.460 --> 26:31.380
The checks are from Yahoo, but, but the notes come from the secretary of agriculture for

26:31.380 --> 26:34.020
some reason.

26:34.020 --> 26:37.940
So there's a lot of like, couldn't there be more wheat in this?

26:37.940 --> 26:41.700
Do you know how many episodes you're supposed to deliver?

26:41.700 --> 26:42.700
Uh, 30.

26:42.700 --> 26:44.300
No, no, we're going to make it.

26:44.300 --> 26:45.300
Yeah.

26:45.300 --> 26:46.300
13, 13.

26:46.300 --> 26:47.300
13.

26:47.300 --> 26:48.300
Is it the same time structure?

26:48.300 --> 26:49.300
Like the same?

26:49.300 --> 26:50.300
Yeah.

26:50.300 --> 26:51.300
As far as I know.

26:51.300 --> 26:52.300
Yeah.

26:52.300 --> 26:53.300
I don't want too much change about it.

26:53.300 --> 26:56.380
I don't want it to be like, bloated out or shrunken down.

26:56.380 --> 26:58.460
I want it to feel relatively the same.

26:58.460 --> 27:00.220
So that's what she said.

27:00.220 --> 27:01.220
That's what she said.

27:01.220 --> 27:02.220
Thank you, Adam.

27:02.220 --> 27:03.220
All right.

27:03.220 --> 27:11.060
Well, let's, we've got, we've got an exciting evening in store for you.

27:11.060 --> 27:12.060
That was...

27:12.060 --> 27:13.060
Kamell Masyani is not here tonight.

27:13.060 --> 27:14.060
Yeah.

27:14.060 --> 27:15.060
Did you hear that?

27:15.060 --> 27:20.460
Kamell, they applaud her when you weren't here because he is listening.

27:20.460 --> 27:22.740
He's not egotistical.

27:22.740 --> 27:23.740
He's busy.

27:23.740 --> 27:24.740
He's too busy.

27:24.740 --> 27:29.900
He's probably in some movie called like, you've got Kamell.

27:29.900 --> 27:34.900
He wishes.

27:34.900 --> 27:35.900
He wishes.

27:35.900 --> 27:38.420
I hope, I hope my stutter made it clear.

27:38.420 --> 27:39.420
I did not approve of that.

27:39.420 --> 27:45.220
As it came out of my mouth, that was my thumbs down on my own dumb pun.

27:45.220 --> 27:52.620
Let's, let's, let's bring to the stage the lovely crimson haired phoenix of the deep

27:52.620 --> 28:16.300
Kamell Masyani, Erin McAfee, hello, Phoenix of the deep, I don't know, I rise, but not,

28:16.300 --> 28:17.300
not that far.

28:17.300 --> 28:18.300
She rises.

28:18.300 --> 28:20.300
She rises and then drowns.

28:20.300 --> 28:28.460
I only know that I'm a phoenix, everyone else is like, she died in that hole.

28:28.460 --> 28:36.020
I was trying to think of Fomke Johnson's X-Men character coming out of the ocean, I whittled

28:36.020 --> 28:41.220
together Phoenix of the deep, my brain's dying, and I'll get a, I'm going to get a

28:41.220 --> 28:43.540
CAT scan of my chest so we can find out if my body's dying.

28:43.540 --> 28:48.100
Dan, give me a three pronged apology about Phoenix of the deep.

28:48.100 --> 28:52.900
I'm sorry I did bad improv as your introduction.

28:52.900 --> 28:57.540
It makes me feel like a hack and like I'm disintegrating in front of your eyes.

28:57.540 --> 28:59.740
You haven't even married me yet.

28:59.740 --> 29:02.980
I'm going to try through a combination of-

29:02.980 --> 29:04.380
Was that your remorse?

29:04.380 --> 29:07.020
That was my remorse, yeah.

29:07.020 --> 29:11.900
My commitment to change is that I'm hoping that somehow a combination of Rogaine and

29:11.900 --> 29:18.660
a new car will help change me to a younger, smarter man.

29:18.660 --> 29:20.660
Possibly a tiny tattoo.

29:20.660 --> 29:27.940
Like maybe a yin-yang on a, Dan, if you had to, if you were a forest gun to your head,

29:27.940 --> 29:29.980
you had to get a tattoo tonight, right?

29:29.980 --> 29:37.220
I walk you just two blocks down to get a tattoo and you have to shoot from the hip.

29:37.220 --> 29:39.980
What tattoo do you get, where do you put it on your body?

29:39.980 --> 29:47.980
All right, I'll limit it to a two or a three inch by three inch square, like size.

29:47.980 --> 29:51.420
All right, well, that's going to go in my chest.

29:51.420 --> 29:59.540
It'll be Pac-Man from the video game, eating dots and then the dots lead to the word establishment.

29:59.540 --> 30:10.540
Which either means the establishment gives you power.

30:10.540 --> 30:15.620
Now, Dan, my follow-up question to that is, how much money do you want me to give you

30:15.620 --> 30:16.620
to make that happen tonight?

30:16.620 --> 30:19.620
I will never get a tattoo.

30:19.620 --> 30:20.620
And I'm not joking.

30:20.620 --> 30:26.300
What is your outside number for us walking down to the tattoo parlor and you getting

30:26.300 --> 30:27.300
that done?

30:27.300 --> 30:29.540
I think I said yes to the Yahoo deal.

30:29.540 --> 30:34.740
I'm never going to need money again.

30:34.740 --> 30:36.380
What would it take to make that happen?

30:36.380 --> 30:39.860
I swear there's no idea that it certainly is.

30:39.860 --> 30:44.540
Maybe, but I'm not committing to this, but not money, but possibly it would have to be

30:44.540 --> 30:46.740
something like you getting an even worse tattoo.

30:46.740 --> 30:52.100
What would that tattoo be?

30:52.100 --> 30:55.100
Adam Goldberg gets to pick what your tattoo is.

30:55.100 --> 30:58.420
Adam Goldberg, come to the stage and give me a worse tattoo, but I'm not committing to

30:58.420 --> 31:02.420
any of this.

31:02.420 --> 31:07.780
Adam Goldberg, if Dan gets the Pac-Man, you're talking about the Pac-Man with the legs and

31:07.780 --> 31:08.780
arms?

31:08.780 --> 31:14.940
No, no, not the, not Paci, the guy from the TV show.

31:14.940 --> 31:15.940
No, no.

31:15.940 --> 31:16.940
They called him Pac-Man.

31:16.940 --> 31:22.780
So you're talking about Pac-Man, just the proper circle with the wedge out of it.

31:22.780 --> 31:23.780
Yeah.

31:23.780 --> 31:28.620
I'm eating power of pellets that said establishment next to it.

31:28.620 --> 31:29.620
Yep.

31:29.620 --> 31:30.620
Okay.

31:30.620 --> 31:42.620
Adam, pitch me what I would get in a, probably just the community season four logo.

31:42.620 --> 31:44.620
Just right on the forehead.

31:44.620 --> 31:47.380
And it's on the forehead?

31:47.380 --> 31:51.940
And it's Wayne Brady saying, I didn't mind it with the word blue and community season

31:51.940 --> 31:53.940
four logo.

31:53.940 --> 32:05.260
Adam Goldberg everybody, Adam Goldberg.

32:05.260 --> 32:09.060
I would never get a tattoo.

32:09.060 --> 32:10.820
I wouldn't either.

32:10.820 --> 32:17.460
I would only get a tattoo of a racial epithet written backwards in black light on my head.

32:17.460 --> 32:20.980
They invented black light tattoo ink and it says something terrible.

32:20.980 --> 32:27.300
And only if you went to a club and they said, let's go to the tattoo shop.

32:27.300 --> 32:31.380
Why do you want it backwards so you can deny, you can plausibly say, so I can see it in

32:31.380 --> 32:35.780
the mirror and remind myself that you're racist.

32:35.780 --> 32:37.780
I would never get a tattoo.

32:37.780 --> 32:43.060
If I did get a tattoo, I think I would get on my chest, I would get the diagram of CPR

32:43.060 --> 32:44.060
instructions.

32:44.060 --> 32:47.980
I like two spots where the paddles go.

32:47.980 --> 32:52.860
Or did I dump my arms and legs, really good recipes.

32:52.860 --> 32:58.300
Like, Jeff, how do you make really good buttermilk biscuits?

32:58.300 --> 33:00.140
Well, that's funny, you should ask.

33:00.140 --> 33:05.980
But what do you do when someone's like, ah, you should add cinnamon?

33:05.980 --> 33:09.460
Like, you try something one day and you're like, this changes the whole thing.

33:09.460 --> 33:11.500
Then I show you my other tattoo, which has...

33:11.500 --> 33:12.500
Asterisks.

33:12.500 --> 33:17.660
No, I'm too OCD to get a tattoo.

33:17.660 --> 33:21.580
If I had a tattoo on one arm, I would feel that that arm weighed more than the other

33:21.580 --> 33:22.580
arm.

33:22.580 --> 33:27.660
I wouldn't mind getting a tattoo of hair on the top of my head.

33:27.660 --> 33:29.740
Are you losing your hair?

33:29.740 --> 33:32.540
Well, I feel like I've always been a little thin.

33:32.540 --> 33:33.540
My hair's very fine.

33:33.540 --> 33:42.220
I'm 41, so what did I think I was going to look like Hugh Grant forever?

33:42.220 --> 33:43.500
He's losing his hair too.

33:43.500 --> 33:45.260
Well, he's older than me.

33:45.260 --> 33:48.140
I mean, Hugh Grant from the movies we've been watching all week.

33:48.140 --> 33:51.260
I had a bit of a Grant Thon.

33:51.260 --> 33:52.940
A Grant Thon?

33:52.940 --> 33:53.940
Yeah.

33:53.940 --> 33:57.940
I just noticed that if I ever see myself on video or in a picture, when my head goes

33:57.940 --> 34:05.100
down and there's light coming at it, like, I'd see nothing but scalp of concern to me.

34:05.100 --> 34:12.460
Also, where I do see a lot of hair, the old comb, I don't comb my hair a lot, so I don't

34:12.460 --> 34:16.700
know if the reason why when I do, like, oh, that's a lot of hair.

34:16.700 --> 34:19.980
I don't know if that's just because I don't comb my hair enough or...

34:19.980 --> 34:22.380
Maybe it's because you have too much hair.

34:22.380 --> 34:23.380
Yeah.

34:23.380 --> 34:29.820
Your hair's like, this isn't fair to Phoenix of the Deep.

34:29.820 --> 34:34.380
Hey, it looks like it's time for Game Corner.

34:34.380 --> 34:36.380
Let's go.

34:36.380 --> 34:44.700
There's a lot of corners to this show.

34:44.700 --> 34:45.700
There are a lot of corners.

34:45.700 --> 34:47.540
Well, there's two corners to the show.

34:47.540 --> 34:51.580
Well, I named both of the corners.

34:51.580 --> 34:53.740
That's why I'm not creative, I guess.

34:53.740 --> 34:55.740
It's all the same.

34:55.740 --> 34:56.740
Ew.

34:56.740 --> 34:58.740
That's not a fun fact.

34:58.740 --> 34:59.740
What?

34:59.740 --> 35:01.380
That's not a fun fact.

35:01.380 --> 35:02.380
No, it's not.

35:02.380 --> 35:03.380
It's...

35:03.380 --> 35:04.380
All right.

35:04.380 --> 35:11.380
Can I have, I need two volunteers for this game, people that maybe have never been on

35:11.380 --> 35:12.380
stage before.

35:12.380 --> 35:14.060
You right here, and you right here.

35:14.060 --> 35:15.380
Oh, you've been on stage?

35:15.380 --> 35:16.380
Mia.

35:16.380 --> 35:18.380
I've never been on stage.

35:18.380 --> 35:19.380
You've never been on stage.

35:19.380 --> 35:20.380
Okay, come on stage.

35:20.380 --> 35:21.380
What is your name?

35:21.380 --> 35:22.380
Oran.

35:22.380 --> 35:23.380
Oran.

35:23.380 --> 35:24.380
Oran.

35:24.380 --> 35:25.380
Oran.

35:25.380 --> 35:26.380
Oran.

35:26.380 --> 35:27.380
Oran.

35:27.380 --> 35:28.380
Oran.

35:28.380 --> 35:29.380
And this is Morgan.

35:29.380 --> 35:30.380
Morgan and Oran.

35:30.380 --> 35:31.380
Hi.

35:31.380 --> 35:32.380
Welcome.

35:32.380 --> 35:34.380
Hi.

35:34.380 --> 35:42.380
We're going to play...we're going to revisit Harmonized Impressions.

35:42.380 --> 35:43.380
Yay!

35:43.380 --> 35:44.380
Thank you.

35:44.380 --> 35:45.380
There we go.

35:45.380 --> 35:47.380
It's a mixed reaction.

35:47.380 --> 35:52.380
And the crowd goes mild.

35:52.380 --> 35:58.380
I think it was a good showmanship for me to say it as I'm doing stuff and it makes me

35:58.380 --> 35:59.380
feel a little ashamed.

35:59.380 --> 36:01.380
Now do it like an impresario.

36:01.380 --> 36:02.380
All right.

36:02.380 --> 36:07.380
Tonight, your lives will change.

36:07.380 --> 36:13.380
Your children will ask you about the day that you witnessed the second coming of Harmonized

36:13.380 --> 36:14.380
Impressions.

36:14.380 --> 36:30.380
Tonight, on Harmonized Impressions, we have Oran, green shirt enthusiast from Masquerado.

36:30.380 --> 36:35.380
And we also have Morgan, who probably played the guitar at some point.

36:35.380 --> 36:36.380
No.

36:36.380 --> 36:37.380
Okay.

36:37.380 --> 36:41.380
She looks like she plays the guitar.

36:41.380 --> 36:43.380
All right.

36:43.380 --> 36:45.380
Now the game is very simple.

36:45.380 --> 36:50.380
You're like the Silver Lake Don Rickles.

36:50.380 --> 36:53.380
Please try my homemade beer in the back of the room.

36:53.380 --> 36:54.380
All right.

36:54.380 --> 36:55.380
Silver Lake Joe.

36:55.380 --> 36:56.380
Okay.

36:56.380 --> 37:01.380
All right, so for this game, Dan is going to perform Impressions.

37:01.380 --> 37:04.380
And you guys are going to be guessing what Impression he's doing.

37:04.380 --> 37:08.380
During the game, you both have a Jeff card.

37:08.380 --> 37:14.380
So you have one opportunity during the course of the game to flag your Jeff card after Dan

37:14.380 --> 37:19.380
performs an Impression, if it's maybe an Impression that you need a little more help on.

37:19.380 --> 37:20.380
All right.

37:20.380 --> 37:22.380
And then Jeff will do the same Impression.

37:22.380 --> 37:23.380
Wait.

37:23.380 --> 37:25.380
I have to help do it?

37:25.380 --> 37:28.380
If they use their Jeff card.

37:28.380 --> 37:30.380
It'll make sense when it happens.

37:30.380 --> 37:31.380
Yes, one time use.

37:31.380 --> 37:32.380
Take a wild card.

37:32.380 --> 37:33.380
Grab this.

37:33.380 --> 37:34.380
Pen.

37:34.380 --> 37:35.380
All right.

37:35.380 --> 37:39.380
For the listeners, I'm doing this seamlessly.

37:39.380 --> 37:41.380
All right.

37:41.380 --> 37:45.380
Dan, here are your Impressions.

37:45.380 --> 37:46.380
Okay.

37:46.380 --> 37:54.380
Now to start the game, you're both going to do a very quick Impression.

37:54.380 --> 37:55.380
Real quick.

37:55.380 --> 38:00.380
Are these Impressions that you've heard Dan do before or not?

38:00.380 --> 38:01.380
No.

38:01.380 --> 38:02.380
No.

38:02.380 --> 38:05.380
Some of them he has, some of them he hasn't.

38:05.380 --> 38:08.380
These are wild cards as far as Dan is concerned.

38:08.380 --> 38:09.380
These are wild cards.

38:09.380 --> 38:15.380
I can see what he's looking on Dan's face right now, that he's flummoxed.

38:15.380 --> 38:19.380
A better word is bummed out.

38:19.380 --> 38:24.380
She said in the Uber on the way over, what phrase did you use?

38:24.380 --> 38:26.380
I was going to gift you more.

38:26.380 --> 38:30.380
Yeah, you were going to throw me some gifts tonight.

38:30.380 --> 38:31.380
All right.

38:31.380 --> 38:32.380
Here we go.

38:32.380 --> 38:34.380
How does the game work?

38:34.380 --> 38:35.380
All right.

38:35.380 --> 38:39.380
So we're going to start the game with each of you doing your best Dan Impression.

38:39.380 --> 38:40.380
And I'm going to be the judge.

38:40.380 --> 38:42.380
So take that into account.

38:42.380 --> 38:44.380
Are we a team?

38:44.380 --> 38:45.380
You're not a team.

38:45.380 --> 38:47.380
You're going out against each other.

38:47.380 --> 38:48.380
You're mortal opponents.

38:48.380 --> 38:49.380
Jeff is going to keep score.

38:49.380 --> 38:51.380
It'll make sense as we go on.

38:51.380 --> 38:54.380
All right, Oran, your best Dan Impression.

38:54.380 --> 38:56.380
Well, the government.

38:56.380 --> 38:59.380
What are you going to do?

38:59.380 --> 39:02.380
Well, I don't know.

39:02.380 --> 39:04.380
All right, Oran.

39:04.380 --> 39:07.380
That was Oran.

39:07.380 --> 39:09.380
No, that was Oran.

39:09.380 --> 39:10.380
That was Oran.

39:10.380 --> 39:11.380
I thought he was Morgan.

39:11.380 --> 39:12.380
I hate trying.

39:12.380 --> 39:13.380
All right, Morgan.

39:13.380 --> 39:14.380
Okay.

39:14.380 --> 39:19.380
You guys, this duck with AIDS walks into.

39:19.380 --> 39:20.380
Oh, fuck.

39:20.380 --> 39:21.380
Fuck.

39:21.380 --> 39:25.380
All right.

39:25.380 --> 39:32.380
I'm going to go with Morgan because I want her to be my friend a little bit more.

39:32.380 --> 39:33.380
All right.

39:33.380 --> 39:35.380
So Morgan's going to go first.

39:35.380 --> 39:36.380
She has one point right now.

39:36.380 --> 39:37.380
She has no points.

39:37.380 --> 39:39.380
Let's just see who goes first.

39:39.380 --> 39:40.380
I don't score that.

39:40.380 --> 39:41.380
Don't score that.

39:41.380 --> 39:42.380
So Morgan is going first.

39:42.380 --> 39:43.380
All right.

39:43.380 --> 39:47.380
Morgan, I'm going to give you two categories and you choose the category from which you

39:47.380 --> 39:49.380
want the impression to be given.

39:49.380 --> 39:53.380
First category is, ah, I didn't see you there.

39:53.380 --> 39:57.380
Second category is, these beats are cold.

39:57.380 --> 40:00.380
Ah, I didn't see you there.

40:00.380 --> 40:02.380
Or these beats are cold.

40:02.380 --> 40:04.380
I don't understand either of this.

40:04.380 --> 40:06.380
So I'm going to go with these beats are cold.

40:06.380 --> 40:07.380
All right.

40:07.380 --> 40:08.380
Great.

40:08.380 --> 40:17.380
So I'm going to go with rappers with temperature related names.

40:17.380 --> 40:21.380
The first time we played this game, we had Dan Reed from Bartlett's book of quotations,

40:21.380 --> 40:26.380
but this time I'm just going to give him a topic and he's going to give a fact or riff

40:26.380 --> 40:27.380
on that topic.

40:27.380 --> 40:31.380
So your topic is pickles.

40:31.380 --> 40:36.380
For real.

40:36.380 --> 40:42.380
As far as I'm concerned, it's two types of pickles in this motherfucker.

40:42.380 --> 40:46.380
Jill and whatever the fuck.

40:46.380 --> 40:52.380
So all your motherfuckers need to get the fuck out of my face.

40:52.380 --> 40:53.380
Excellent.

40:53.380 --> 40:54.380
All right.

40:54.380 --> 40:55.380
Morgan.

40:55.380 --> 40:58.380
I know who it is.

40:58.380 --> 41:06.380
Morgan was that A, iced tea, B, ice cube, or C, vanilla ice.

41:06.380 --> 41:07.380
Ice cube.

41:07.380 --> 41:08.380
Correct.

41:08.380 --> 41:09.380
Right.

41:09.380 --> 41:10.380
Flawless.

41:10.380 --> 41:11.380
Go.

41:11.380 --> 41:12.380
Go.

41:12.380 --> 41:13.380
All right.

41:13.380 --> 41:25.380
Oren, your categories are, ah, I didn't see you there, or falsetto ladies do it best.

41:25.380 --> 41:28.380
I'm going to say no to that one.

41:28.380 --> 41:29.380
All right.

41:29.380 --> 41:32.380
So this is a member of Monty Python.

41:32.380 --> 41:42.380
And Dan, your topic is the God particle.

41:42.380 --> 41:50.380
I already know it.

41:50.380 --> 41:56.380
They found this particle they did.

41:56.380 --> 42:01.380
I was right.

42:01.380 --> 42:06.380
It's a good particle.

42:06.380 --> 42:08.380
Is he from Australia?

42:08.380 --> 42:09.380
Yes, he's Australia.

42:09.380 --> 42:10.380
No, it's not.

42:10.380 --> 42:16.380
It's not supposed to be.

42:16.380 --> 42:22.380
I think it's called the Gibson Hughes particle.

42:22.380 --> 42:26.380
I can't stop sounding Australian.

42:26.380 --> 42:27.380
All right.

42:27.380 --> 42:34.380
Oren, was that A, Eric Idle, B, John Cleese, C, Graham Chapman?

42:34.380 --> 42:40.380
I'm going to go with B.

42:40.380 --> 42:41.380
That is incorrect.

42:41.380 --> 42:43.380
It was Eric Idle.

42:43.380 --> 42:44.380
All right.

42:44.380 --> 42:49.380
That's not an Eric Idle.

42:49.380 --> 42:52.380
This is an Eric Idle.

42:52.380 --> 42:56.380
By the way, Jeff, when I did that sound effect, what did that sound like?

42:56.380 --> 42:57.380
The oooooh.

42:57.380 --> 42:59.380
I thought it was?

42:59.380 --> 43:00.380
Yeah, yeah.

43:00.380 --> 43:01.380
Okay, great.

43:01.380 --> 43:02.380
Wow.

43:02.380 --> 43:03.380
All right.

43:03.380 --> 43:04.380
Wow.

43:04.380 --> 43:05.380
All right.

43:05.380 --> 43:10.380
So whenever someone's incorrect, I'm going to go like this to you, okay?

43:10.380 --> 43:11.380
All right.

43:11.380 --> 43:12.380
Here we go.

43:12.380 --> 43:14.380
That is amazing.

43:14.380 --> 43:16.380
Finally you can offer something.

43:16.380 --> 43:20.380
I've been given a gift.

43:20.380 --> 43:23.380
You need to use that to help people.

43:23.380 --> 43:25.380
Like ship captains.

43:25.380 --> 43:28.380
Go to the shipyard.

43:28.380 --> 43:31.380
It's better than a real fog horn.

43:31.380 --> 43:33.380
Get something wrong again.

43:33.380 --> 43:35.380
You'll hear it again.

43:35.380 --> 43:36.380
All right.

43:36.380 --> 43:37.380
Here we go.

43:37.380 --> 43:38.380
All right.

43:38.380 --> 43:39.380
You know what?

43:39.380 --> 43:41.380
I'm going to do my next impression really bad on purpose just to hear that sound again.

43:41.380 --> 43:43.380
Of course it's 1-0, right?

43:43.380 --> 43:44.380
It's 1-0.

43:44.380 --> 43:45.380
1-0.

43:45.380 --> 43:46.380
Morgan is in the lead.

43:46.380 --> 43:49.380
Morgan has jumped out to a shocking lead.

43:49.380 --> 43:56.380
Morgan, your categories to choose from are, ah, I didn't see you there, or the rhythm

43:56.380 --> 43:59.380
of Spellbound Vogue.

43:59.380 --> 44:02.380
I better go with the rhythm.

44:02.380 --> 44:03.380
Yeah.

44:03.380 --> 44:04.380
Okay.

44:04.380 --> 44:10.380
So these are female pop stars that were successful in the 80s and beyond, or female pop stars.

44:10.380 --> 44:11.380
So that's who this is.

44:11.380 --> 44:13.380
Dan's got this nail on right now.

44:13.380 --> 44:16.380
And Dan, your subject is Kubla-Con.

44:16.380 --> 44:18.380
Kubla-Con?

44:18.380 --> 44:19.380
Kubla-Con.

44:19.380 --> 44:20.380
What?

44:20.380 --> 44:21.380
Kubla-Con.

44:21.380 --> 44:22.380
Kubla-Con?

44:22.380 --> 44:23.380
It's a convention.

44:23.380 --> 44:24.380
Kubla-Con.

44:24.380 --> 44:25.380
What did you say?

44:25.380 --> 44:26.380
It's a convention?

44:26.380 --> 44:27.380
A convention.

44:27.380 --> 44:28.380
I thought it was a poem.

44:28.380 --> 44:39.380
I worked with Kubla-Con on my third video.

44:39.380 --> 44:46.380
And he was fantastic.

44:46.380 --> 44:48.380
And I'm really classy.

44:48.380 --> 44:49.380
All right.

44:49.380 --> 44:50.380
Okay.

44:50.380 --> 45:02.380
Morgan, was that A, Janet Jackson, B, Madonna, C, Paula Abdul?

45:02.380 --> 45:03.380
Can I use my wildcard?

45:03.380 --> 45:04.380
You can!

45:04.380 --> 45:05.380
Thank you.

45:05.380 --> 45:06.380
All right.

45:06.380 --> 45:11.380
So Jeff, it is this person.

45:11.380 --> 45:12.380
Yeah.

45:12.380 --> 45:13.380
All right.

45:13.380 --> 45:17.380
And your subject is gravity.

45:17.380 --> 45:28.380
Listen, gravity, stop preaching.

45:28.380 --> 45:39.380
It's like you're some sort of celestial father.

45:39.380 --> 45:45.380
I'm like the Madonna.

45:45.380 --> 45:46.380
All right.

45:46.380 --> 45:57.380
Morgan, was that A, Janet Jackson?

45:57.380 --> 46:02.380
B, Madonna, C, Paula Abdul.

46:02.380 --> 46:03.380
Madonna.

46:03.380 --> 46:04.380
That is correct.

46:04.380 --> 46:05.380
I was doing Janet Jackson.

46:05.380 --> 46:06.380
You were?

46:06.380 --> 46:07.380
No.

46:07.380 --> 46:08.380
Why would I just...

46:08.380 --> 46:09.380
I'm too gullible.

46:09.380 --> 46:12.380
Jeff, do you know how to make a bicycle bell?

46:12.380 --> 46:13.380
Yes.

46:13.380 --> 46:14.380
Dude, go ahead.

46:14.380 --> 46:15.380
Okay.

46:15.380 --> 46:19.380
When it's correct, then you do the bicycle bell.

46:19.380 --> 46:29.380
All right.

46:29.380 --> 46:30.380
Orange.

46:30.380 --> 46:32.380
2-0, Morgan's in the lead.

46:32.380 --> 46:35.380
You still have time to catch up.

46:35.380 --> 46:36.380
Your categories are...

46:36.380 --> 46:37.380
Ah!

46:37.380 --> 46:39.380
I didn't see you there.

46:39.380 --> 46:41.380
Or, don't be shy-er.

46:41.380 --> 46:46.380
Let's go with don't be shy-er.

46:46.380 --> 46:48.380
All right.

46:48.380 --> 46:49.380
So these are...

46:49.380 --> 46:52.380
This is an actor from the Lord of the Rings trilogy.

46:52.380 --> 46:59.380
Dan, your subject is the Donner Party.

46:59.380 --> 47:12.380
Is it the Madonna Party?

47:12.380 --> 47:20.380
Oh, the pain that was felt by your kind when you were in that cabin.

47:20.380 --> 47:24.380
I wish you never to feel it again.

47:24.380 --> 47:27.380
Come to me.

47:27.380 --> 47:30.380
Don't eat each other.

47:30.380 --> 47:35.380
For you are doomed to live but one life.

47:35.380 --> 47:46.380
It becomes a broken love.

47:46.380 --> 47:47.380
All right.

47:47.380 --> 47:52.380
Oren, was that A, Orlando Bloom.

47:52.380 --> 47:54.380
B, Kate Blanchett.

47:54.380 --> 47:56.380
Or C, Liv Tyler.

47:56.380 --> 48:01.380
No, Kate Blanchett.

48:01.380 --> 48:11.580
All right, it was a really good live Tyler. Thank you, Kate Blanchett would have been a lot more

48:11.580 --> 48:21.740
strident. Dan, just for fun, can we hear a little Blanchett talking about pickles? Yeah.

48:21.740 --> 48:37.420
Listen close and hock into the tail of the plastic. All right, Morgan, your categories are,

48:37.420 --> 48:48.380
I didn't see you there, or tipsy TV. I think I'll bite on the ad and see you there. All right,

48:48.380 --> 49:02.260
so these are, this is a creepy man related to movies. And Dan, your subject is traffic.

49:02.260 --> 49:11.060
Oh, it was so hard getting down here on the five today. I didn't think I'd be able to get off

49:11.060 --> 49:22.820
under 10 because there was spiders and ghosts. But I loved them. I let them merge in front of me

49:22.820 --> 49:37.940
because I love spiders and ghosts. All right, Morgan, was that a Tim Burton?

49:37.940 --> 49:55.700
Famous voice actor. Yeah, like Madonna. B. Vincent Price or C. Ed Wood. Tim Burton.

49:55.700 --> 50:10.500
It was Vincent Price. It was Vincent Price. It's a pretty good Vincent Price. Yeah, you know,

50:10.500 --> 50:19.780
but Morgan, how old are you? 26. Yeah, you don't know Vincent Price. All right,

50:19.780 --> 50:29.260
Oren, your topics are tipsy TV, your categories are tipsy TV or Dan Dudes. Let's go Dan Dudes.

50:29.260 --> 50:44.980
All right, these are, this is a friend of Dan's. And Dan, your subject is shoes.

50:44.980 --> 50:50.900
I'll tell you something about good shoes. A good shoe is the most important thing in the world.

50:50.900 --> 50:58.140
I got some with ass Justin Timberlake shoes the other day. I had them laced up. I go outside

50:58.140 --> 51:04.060
my house, I'm just gonna go get a coffee. A guy comes up, what are you doing? What are you wearing?

51:04.060 --> 51:16.580
I'm just wearing some shoes. That's all I do. He goes, thank you. Those shoes are perfect.

51:16.580 --> 51:27.700
I didn't know they were perfect. I just wore the shoes. This is Paul Abdul. My shoes are amazing.

51:27.700 --> 51:42.940
All right, Oren. Was that A, Rob Schrab, B, Jeff Davis, or C, Spencer Crittendon? Jeff Davis.

51:42.940 --> 51:50.900
That is correct! Justin Timberlake shoes? I don't know. I don't know the names of shoes.

51:50.900 --> 51:55.100
I'm not gonna wear some Justin Timberlake shoes. Other than that, how did you feel about that

51:55.100 --> 52:04.300
impression? Was it like listening in a mirror? Yes, it was like listening in a mirror. I thought it

52:04.300 --> 52:16.700
was all right. Jeff, what is the score? The score is two to one. Morgan is in a shocking two-to-one

52:16.700 --> 52:25.420
lead. All right, Morgan. This is just like soccer. Morgan, your categories are tipsy TV or animated

52:25.420 --> 52:35.420
father types. Tipsy TV. Tipsy TV. All right, so this is a male performer who's on television in the

52:35.420 --> 52:51.140
1970s. You're a fan of the show. All right, so Dan, your subject is horses. So my friend called me

52:51.140 --> 52:59.860
and he said, let's go to the horse track. And I said, let's go to the hump. Let's use my car.

52:59.860 --> 53:15.380
So we got in the car and we started up that. And we go down the driveway. I'm in heaven. I am in

53:15.380 --> 53:24.060
heaven. All right, Morgan. Maybe rely on your power of deduction. Morgan, if you get this right,

53:24.060 --> 53:40.500
I'm going to buy you a car. I'm going to buy you a car. I'm going to buy you a car. Morgan. What is that?

53:40.500 --> 53:53.940
A. Charlie Callas. B. Sammy Davis Jr. or C. Dean Martin. She has no idea what you're talking about.

53:53.940 --> 53:57.940
She doesn't know any of those three people.

53:57.940 --> 54:01.940
Yes, I did forget all the people, so person A.

54:01.940 --> 54:04.940
That is correct!

54:04.940 --> 54:10.940
You get a point, you get a point, you get a...

54:10.940 --> 54:16.940
Morgan, you get to go home in your very own car.

54:16.940 --> 54:18.940
Alright, we're nearing the end.

54:18.940 --> 54:21.940
Thank you for doing Charlie Cowell's, by the way. I love that.

54:21.940 --> 54:25.940
You're welcome.

54:25.940 --> 54:30.940
If you don't know Charlie Cowell's, fuck it, just Google him.

54:30.940 --> 54:31.940
He's so good.

54:31.940 --> 54:33.940
Better than Justin Timberlake's shoes.

54:33.940 --> 54:37.940
Justin Timberlake's shoes? What kind of shoes is Justin Timberlake's?

54:37.940 --> 54:40.940
Improvising fancy shoe names, I don't know.

54:40.940 --> 54:42.940
Were you thinking Timberlake's?

54:42.940 --> 54:44.940
No, I mean, well, maybe.

54:44.940 --> 54:46.940
Yeah, I don't know.

54:46.940 --> 54:50.940
Justin Timberlake's shoes.

54:50.940 --> 54:53.940
Alright, Oren.

54:53.940 --> 54:58.940
Animated father types, or it's mandated.

54:58.940 --> 55:03.940
Animated father types, or it's mandated.

55:03.940 --> 55:05.940
Animated father types.

55:05.940 --> 55:11.940
Alright, so this is a fatherly cartoon character.

55:11.940 --> 55:16.940
It's one of one.

55:16.940 --> 55:24.940
Dan, your subject is feminism.

55:24.940 --> 55:28.940
There's one thing I don't understand about women.

55:28.940 --> 55:32.940
How come they need equal rights?

55:32.940 --> 55:39.940
Why can't they get an equal dino left?

55:39.940 --> 55:41.940
Alright, Oren.

55:41.940 --> 55:47.940
Was that A. I'm talking about abuse in a prehistoric context.

55:47.940 --> 55:52.940
Ha-bow!

55:52.940 --> 55:55.940
Great, great.

55:55.940 --> 56:01.940
Was that A. Yogi Bear.

56:01.940 --> 56:08.940
B. George Jetson.

56:08.940 --> 56:11.940
Or C. Fred Flintstone.

56:11.940 --> 56:16.940
That is correct!

56:16.940 --> 56:17.940
Alright, Morgan.

56:17.940 --> 56:19.940
Scores two to three.

56:19.940 --> 56:21.940
Alright, okay.

56:21.940 --> 56:25.940
Morgan, it's mandated, or it's mandated.

56:25.940 --> 56:31.940
Or when a pretty woman loves your diary.

56:31.940 --> 56:33.940
It's mandated.

56:33.940 --> 56:41.940
Alright, so this is a performer with the first name Amanda or Mandy.

56:41.940 --> 56:47.940
And Dan, your subject is Betsy Ross.

56:47.940 --> 56:49.940
She made a flag.

56:49.940 --> 56:51.940
She made a flag for you.

56:51.940 --> 56:55.940
And you should respect that.

56:55.940 --> 56:58.940
She put every star on it.

56:58.940 --> 57:00.940
She put every stripe.

57:00.940 --> 57:03.940
It means something.

57:03.940 --> 57:06.940
Alright, Morgan.

57:06.940 --> 57:11.940
Was that A. Mandy Moore.

57:11.940 --> 57:16.940
B. Mandy Patinkin.

57:16.940 --> 57:25.940
Or C. Amanda Mandy Bynes.

57:25.940 --> 57:28.940
Mandy Moore?

57:28.940 --> 57:32.940
Should have been Thinkin' Patinkin.

57:32.940 --> 57:35.940
It was Mandy Patinkin.

57:35.940 --> 57:37.940
Mandy Patinkin.

57:37.940 --> 57:39.940
That was a good Mandy Patinkin.

57:39.940 --> 57:40.940
It was alright.

57:40.940 --> 57:41.940
It was.

57:41.940 --> 57:42.940
For the first time?

57:42.940 --> 57:44.940
Alright, Orin.

57:44.940 --> 57:45.940
The first time.

57:45.940 --> 57:51.940
You never forget your first Patinkin.

57:51.940 --> 57:52.940
Alright, this is the...

57:52.940 --> 57:53.940
We're all tied up.

57:53.940 --> 57:54.940
How many rounds do we have?

57:54.940 --> 57:55.940
We're all tied up?

57:55.940 --> 57:56.940
This is the last one.

57:56.940 --> 57:57.940
This is three to three.

57:57.940 --> 57:59.940
The winner will be the winner of the game.

57:59.940 --> 58:02.940
Okay, so if you get this correct,

58:02.940 --> 58:05.940
then you win the game if you get it incorrect.

58:05.940 --> 58:07.940
You guys finish it for me.

58:07.940 --> 58:09.940
No, no, no.

58:09.940 --> 58:12.940
If there's no score, we're still tied.

58:12.940 --> 58:15.940
Okay, then we'll go to the tiebreaker.

58:15.940 --> 58:16.940
Okay.

58:16.940 --> 58:17.940
Alright.

58:17.940 --> 58:18.940
We'll go to P.K.'s.

58:18.940 --> 58:20.940
We'll go to the tiebreaker.

58:20.940 --> 58:22.940
So your categories to choose from are

58:22.940 --> 58:28.940
When a pretty woman loves your diary, or Abra Kadab Bra.

58:28.940 --> 58:31.940
I have to go with the pun.

58:31.940 --> 58:32.940
Abra Kadab Bra.

58:32.940 --> 58:33.940
Abba Kadabra.

58:33.940 --> 58:35.940
Alright, so this is a magician.

58:35.940 --> 58:43.940
Alright, and Dan, your subject is Australia.

58:43.940 --> 58:47.940
The whole country down there is...

58:47.940 --> 58:50.940
The whole country is under the earth.

58:50.940 --> 58:55.940
To me, that's real magic.

58:55.940 --> 58:58.940
I just want to do things that amaze people,

58:58.940 --> 59:01.940
so I want to go down there and see how they live

59:01.940 --> 59:06.940
and show them some things.

59:06.940 --> 59:08.940
Look at this.

59:08.940 --> 59:11.940
Can I see your boomerang?

59:11.940 --> 59:14.940
Can I show you something about it for a second?

59:14.940 --> 59:17.940
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

59:17.940 --> 59:20.940
I just want to show you something.

59:20.940 --> 59:23.940
So if you shake a boomerang, it's spirits.

59:23.940 --> 59:26.940
Do you know there's spirits in it?

59:26.940 --> 59:28.940
Okay, and then what happens?

59:28.940 --> 59:34.940
Oh, shit! Motherfucker got that!

59:34.940 --> 59:38.940
Yeah, yeah, you like that. You like that.

59:38.940 --> 59:39.940
Alright, alright.

59:39.940 --> 59:42.940
There's Paul Abdul.

59:42.940 --> 59:46.940
Was that A. David Copperfield.

59:46.940 --> 59:49.940
B. Chris Angel.

59:49.940 --> 59:52.940
Or C. David Blaine.

59:52.940 --> 59:53.940
Use the card.

59:53.940 --> 59:55.940
Yeah, it's a shot in the dark, but I'm going to use the Jeff card.

59:55.940 --> 59:59.940
Alright, Jeff.

59:59.940 --> 01:00:00.940
What happens now?

01:00:00.940 --> 01:00:02.940
Alright, so you're going to do...

01:00:02.940 --> 01:00:04.940
Just polish the edges of that one, Jeff.

01:00:04.940 --> 01:00:05.940
An impression of this person.

01:00:05.940 --> 01:00:07.940
Don't do an overhaul.

01:00:07.940 --> 01:00:09.940
Now you need to reinvent the wheel.

01:00:09.940 --> 01:00:12.940
Just round it off.

01:00:12.940 --> 01:00:17.940
And Jeff, your subject is bobsleds.

01:00:17.940 --> 01:00:23.940
Oh, it's...

01:00:23.940 --> 01:00:27.940
Seems like a lot of ice and snow out here.

01:00:27.940 --> 01:00:33.940
Alright, I'm going to spend the next 73 million years inside...

01:00:33.940 --> 01:00:45.940
Inside of an igloo cooler underneath the bobsled track at...

01:00:45.940 --> 01:00:50.940
Rockefeller Plaza Ice Rink.

01:00:50.940 --> 01:00:55.940
And if I come out before 73 years, that means magic isn't real.

01:00:55.940 --> 01:01:02.940
Also, I have eyebrows.

01:01:02.940 --> 01:01:08.940
My name is Palmer Abdullah.

01:01:08.940 --> 01:01:09.940
Oh, man.

01:01:09.940 --> 01:01:11.940
I don't really know, so I'm going to kind of guess.

01:01:11.940 --> 01:01:17.940
I'm going to guess Chris Angel.

01:01:17.940 --> 01:01:22.940
Dude, we fucking did the best David Blaine impressions of all time.

01:01:22.940 --> 01:01:24.940
Alright, so Morgan is our winner!

01:01:24.940 --> 01:01:30.940
Morgan is the winner!

01:01:30.940 --> 01:01:35.940
Thank you so much for watching Harmonized Impressions!

01:01:35.940 --> 01:01:36.940
Thank you.

01:01:36.940 --> 01:01:38.940
Aaron, what does Morgan win?

01:01:38.940 --> 01:01:43.940
She wins playing Chris de Burgh during D&D.

01:01:43.940 --> 01:01:45.940
Morgan, stay on stage.

01:01:45.940 --> 01:01:51.940
Let's bring out Spencer Crittenden and we'll play some D&D with Morgan.

01:01:51.940 --> 01:01:54.940
Let's go!

01:01:54.940 --> 01:01:57.940
Let's go!

01:01:57.940 --> 01:02:02.940
Let's go!

01:02:02.940 --> 01:02:04.940
Hey, guys.

01:02:04.940 --> 01:02:05.940
How is it?

01:02:05.940 --> 01:02:06.940
Spencer Crittenden, welcome.

01:02:06.940 --> 01:02:07.940
Thanks.

01:02:07.940 --> 01:02:11.940
I feel welcomed by you all.

01:02:11.940 --> 01:02:15.940
Now I don't.

01:02:15.940 --> 01:02:16.940
That's a plus for you.

01:02:16.940 --> 01:02:17.940
Yeah.

01:02:17.940 --> 01:02:20.940
It rises and then it dies.

01:02:20.940 --> 01:02:21.940
It's tough.

01:02:21.940 --> 01:02:22.940
Welcome to hell.

01:02:22.940 --> 01:02:23.940
It rises.

01:02:23.940 --> 01:02:25.940
What, uh, that was a great game.

01:02:25.940 --> 01:02:26.940
Spencer, how are you feeling, man?

01:02:26.940 --> 01:02:29.940
I'm feeling a bit, uh, a bit tired.

01:02:29.940 --> 01:02:30.940
You're really high right now, right?

01:02:30.940 --> 01:02:32.940
I got a new vaporizer.

01:02:32.940 --> 01:02:35.940
Yeah, I did.

01:02:35.940 --> 01:02:38.940
You're as high as a Georgia pine right now.

01:02:38.940 --> 01:02:40.940
Those are tall trees.

01:02:40.940 --> 01:02:42.940
Yeah, my experience.

01:02:42.940 --> 01:02:43.940
They're not that tall.

01:02:43.940 --> 01:02:47.940
I can tell by the way that you're gripping the right side of your head.

01:02:47.940 --> 01:02:53.940
Yeah, my neck's not doing its job so good.

01:02:53.940 --> 01:02:55.940
My neck could use a little pinch hitting.

01:02:55.940 --> 01:02:56.940
Yeah.

01:02:56.940 --> 01:02:59.940
We're cooperating.

01:02:59.940 --> 01:03:05.940
Hey, what's with that vapor place over across the street from where we do the show?

01:03:05.940 --> 01:03:06.940
It's the vapor spot.

01:03:06.940 --> 01:03:10.940
Like that's just a place where you go to smoke vapor tobacco.

01:03:10.940 --> 01:03:15.940
Yeah, they have like different colors and flavors and you could talk about your different

01:03:15.940 --> 01:03:17.940
modifications they made here.

01:03:17.940 --> 01:03:18.940
Is it open still?

01:03:18.940 --> 01:03:19.940
Probably.

01:03:19.940 --> 01:03:23.940
Is that like an uptick off of like a hookah place?

01:03:23.940 --> 01:03:24.940
Yeah.

01:03:24.940 --> 01:03:25.940
Now you just vape?

01:03:25.940 --> 01:03:30.940
Yeah, or like Woody Harrelson's oxygen bar because it says that they have oxygen too.

01:03:30.940 --> 01:03:34.940
Like it just doesn't seem like, I mean, I don't know what's successful and what's not.

01:03:34.940 --> 01:03:35.940
I can't predict success.

01:03:35.940 --> 01:03:38.940
Spencer, can I hear your Woody Harrelson impression?

01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:44.940
Hey, man.

01:03:44.940 --> 01:03:45.940
Right.

01:03:45.940 --> 01:03:47.940
Yeah, yeah.

01:03:47.940 --> 01:03:50.940
It's not bad, right?

01:03:50.940 --> 01:03:52.940
He has an oxygen bar?

01:03:52.940 --> 01:03:54.940
He used to, but it shut down.

01:03:54.940 --> 01:04:00.940
Man, I saw one of those in Orange County fucking got a bunch of jars of air.

01:04:00.940 --> 01:04:03.940
It just doesn't seem like it's like pinkberry.

01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:04.940
Okay.

01:04:04.940 --> 01:04:08.940
If you told me, you know, like, like, okay, hey, who would have known that like just a

01:04:08.940 --> 01:04:11.940
different kind of frozen yogurt or whatever would would take off?

01:04:11.940 --> 01:04:13.940
Like I wouldn't, I wouldn't be like, who would have thought?

01:04:13.940 --> 01:04:14.940
Yeah.

01:04:14.940 --> 01:04:20.940
But like I would definitely not predict vapor or oxygen being like a new thing.

01:04:20.940 --> 01:04:23.940
I mean, I can't imagine that those places are doing that.

01:04:23.940 --> 01:04:28.940
I'm going to say vapor places go the way as a dodo like oxygen bars did too.

01:04:28.940 --> 01:04:29.940
Yeah.

01:04:29.940 --> 01:04:30.940
I really hope so.

01:04:30.940 --> 01:04:31.940
Yeah.

01:04:31.940 --> 01:04:32.940
Yeah.

01:04:32.940 --> 01:04:33.940
Krispy Kreme.

01:04:33.940 --> 01:04:34.940
It's a donut.

01:04:34.940 --> 01:04:35.940
It's good.

01:04:35.940 --> 01:04:36.940
Like we all kind of predicted that success.

01:04:36.940 --> 01:04:37.940
Make a good donut.

01:04:37.940 --> 01:04:38.940
Yeah.

01:04:38.940 --> 01:04:41.940
Or just one that's really bad for you.

01:04:41.940 --> 01:04:47.940
Like every year I do a gig at the MGM Grand Casino in Vegas and there's an oxygen place

01:04:47.940 --> 01:04:50.940
and people sit down and you strap on a bunch of oxygen into your face.

01:04:50.940 --> 01:04:53.940
It looks like a bummer.

01:04:53.940 --> 01:04:58.940
Well, in Vegas that might, I mean, yeah, maybe you might, you might actually need oxygen

01:04:58.940 --> 01:04:59.940
in Vegas.

01:04:59.940 --> 01:05:03.940
But they, but they hyper oxygenate the casinos.

01:05:03.940 --> 01:05:05.940
It's supposed to be good for hangovers, right?

01:05:05.940 --> 01:05:06.940
Yeah.

01:05:06.940 --> 01:05:08.940
Don't they also put an IV drip on you when they do that?

01:05:08.940 --> 01:05:13.940
They have mobile hangover vans that they, where they give you saline.

01:05:13.940 --> 01:05:17.940
They have those in China, but they just kill you.

01:05:17.940 --> 01:05:20.940
I think you're thinking of Soylent Green.

01:05:20.940 --> 01:05:23.940
It's still fictional as of yet.

01:05:23.940 --> 01:05:26.940
As of press time, China hasn't gone to Soylent Green yet.

01:05:26.940 --> 01:05:28.940
Murder vans though.

01:05:28.940 --> 01:05:30.940
Did they just murder vans in China?

01:05:30.940 --> 01:05:31.940
They don't.

01:05:31.940 --> 01:05:32.940
Oh yeah.

01:05:32.940 --> 01:05:33.940
Did you, what, what?

01:05:33.940 --> 01:05:34.940
All right, tell us.

01:05:34.940 --> 01:05:35.940
Come on.

01:05:35.940 --> 01:05:38.940
There's just like these vans full of Chinese officials that are just waiting to grab people,

01:05:38.940 --> 01:05:40.940
pull them in and just put them to sleep.

01:05:40.940 --> 01:05:41.940
For what?

01:05:41.940 --> 01:05:44.940
For being Chinese, man.

01:05:44.940 --> 01:05:45.940
Wait.

01:05:45.940 --> 01:05:47.940
How do you know when you're finished?

01:05:47.940 --> 01:05:49.940
Well, you never are.

01:05:49.940 --> 01:05:50.940
That's the thing.

01:05:50.940 --> 01:05:54.940
I mean, they kill you, but not two hours after you want to be killed again.

01:05:54.940 --> 01:05:56.940
That is such a...

01:05:56.940 --> 01:05:57.940
What?

01:05:57.940 --> 01:05:58.940
What?

01:05:58.940 --> 01:06:01.940
What are you talking about?

01:06:01.940 --> 01:06:05.940
Someone deflated in the audience.

01:06:05.940 --> 01:06:07.940
Chinese murder vans.

01:06:07.940 --> 01:06:08.940
Wait.

01:06:08.940 --> 01:06:11.940
Come on, explicate.

01:06:11.940 --> 01:06:14.940
That's one of those things that I know, but I don't know why I know.

01:06:14.940 --> 01:06:16.940
That's all the information I have on that.

01:06:16.940 --> 01:06:21.940
I want you to just freestyle and tell me what a Chinese murder van is about.

01:06:21.940 --> 01:06:24.940
I mean, did I not say?

01:06:24.940 --> 01:06:28.940
You say there are roving vans that will just kill you for being Chinese?

01:06:28.940 --> 01:06:29.940
Well, yeah.

01:06:29.940 --> 01:06:31.940
No, not for being Chinese.

01:06:31.940 --> 01:06:35.940
They're like enemy people, like people the government needs disappeared, you know?

01:06:35.940 --> 01:06:38.940
So a van pulls up, like, hey, you seem like a cool guy.

01:06:38.940 --> 01:06:41.940
No, it's more violent than that.

01:06:41.940 --> 01:06:43.940
Just grab you.

01:06:43.940 --> 01:06:46.940
Did they grab you, put you in a van, and just fucking...

01:06:46.940 --> 01:06:49.940
And why use saline?

01:06:49.940 --> 01:06:50.940
That seems so...

01:06:50.940 --> 01:06:51.940
No, they don't.

01:06:51.940 --> 01:06:55.940
Instead of saline, it's more like poison juice.

01:06:55.940 --> 01:06:57.940
Poison juice?

01:06:57.940 --> 01:06:58.940
Yeah.

01:06:58.940 --> 01:06:59.940
What do they call it?

01:06:59.940 --> 01:07:00.940
MSG.

01:07:00.940 --> 01:07:02.940
Kool-Aid.

01:07:02.940 --> 01:07:10.940
So if you're an enemy of the Chinese state, a van pulls up, and they go, hey, they coerce you,

01:07:10.940 --> 01:07:12.940
or they just strong arm you and pull you in the van.

01:07:12.940 --> 01:07:14.940
Yeah, that's what I'm alleging.

01:07:14.940 --> 01:07:16.940
And then...

01:07:22.940 --> 01:07:26.940
Didn't China soften their policy on...

01:07:26.940 --> 01:07:28.940
Fire drills?

01:07:28.940 --> 01:07:33.940
Recently, like, they don't need them to happen at every intersection now.

01:07:33.940 --> 01:07:36.940
Because they did some research and they're totally inefficient.

01:07:36.940 --> 01:07:39.940
They actually, like, put a tracking device on everybody.

01:07:39.940 --> 01:07:44.940
And for a Chinese fire drill, like, actually, it's no safer than just having no fire drill at all.

01:07:44.940 --> 01:07:47.940
It turns out you should just run away from the fire.

01:07:47.940 --> 01:07:50.940
Somebody's handing you research, I think.

01:07:50.940 --> 01:07:52.940
That's one of our...

01:07:52.940 --> 01:07:55.940
Or maybe it's the definition of racism.

01:07:55.940 --> 01:08:02.940
Amnesty International is handing you an affidavit.

01:08:02.940 --> 01:08:07.940
I've been handed a phone that says, the execution van, also called a mobile execution unit,

01:08:07.940 --> 01:08:12.940
was developed by the government of the People's Republic of China, and was first used in 1997.

01:08:12.940 --> 01:08:16.940
There's evidence that mobile execution chambers existed before 97.

01:08:16.940 --> 01:08:19.940
The state of Delaware and the United States of America

01:08:19.940 --> 01:08:24.940
purges a mobile lethal injection chamber in 1986.

01:08:24.940 --> 01:08:29.940
The prisoner is strapped into a stretcher and killed inside the van.

01:08:29.940 --> 01:08:34.940
The van allows death sentences to be carried out without moving the prisoner to an execution ground.

01:08:34.940 --> 01:08:36.940
Well, that's nice.

01:08:36.940 --> 01:08:40.940
It's like a dog groomer.

01:08:40.940 --> 01:08:44.940
The vans also require less manpower per injection.

01:08:44.940 --> 01:08:46.940
Oh, no, no, no, I, I, I, I write ahead.

01:08:46.940 --> 01:08:50.940
Less manpower per execution requiring four persons to assist the injection.

01:08:50.940 --> 01:08:56.940
The PRCU states that the vans are more humane than previous forms of execution.

01:08:56.940 --> 01:08:57.940
Yeah, well.

01:08:57.940 --> 01:09:00.940
Including being bashed in the did-of-by-rock.

01:09:00.940 --> 01:09:02.940
Yeah, yeah, like, yeah, like...

01:09:02.940 --> 01:09:03.940
The torture monster.

01:09:03.940 --> 01:09:05.940
Smoking a cigarette with a blindfold on.

01:09:05.940 --> 01:09:08.940
China didn't...

01:09:08.940 --> 01:09:16.940
It may be wrong, but they didn't try to get in trouble for selling their dead prisoners to body worlds a few years ago.

01:09:16.940 --> 01:09:24.940
Yeah, I hear they didn't really get caught until they were, you know, they were found out they were selling drugs to universities.

01:09:24.940 --> 01:09:28.940
Yeah, well, everybody was looking at these bodies at body worlds and similar exhibits and being like,

01:09:28.940 --> 01:09:30.940
where are these little Chinese?

01:09:30.940 --> 01:09:32.940
All these guys.

01:09:32.940 --> 01:09:33.940
They were, they were selling them.

01:09:33.940 --> 01:09:34.940
You hear that, China?

01:09:34.940 --> 01:09:35.940
We caught you doing something bad.

01:09:35.940 --> 01:09:37.940
Now it's curtains.

01:09:37.940 --> 01:09:39.940
Finally.

01:09:39.940 --> 01:09:44.940
We finally caught the Chinese up there up to something.

01:09:44.940 --> 01:09:47.940
Like, now it's, now it's all over for them.

01:09:47.940 --> 01:09:49.940
They own us!

01:09:49.940 --> 01:09:50.940
They do.

01:09:50.940 --> 01:09:52.940
There's nothing we can do.

01:09:52.940 --> 01:09:55.940
Those vans are coming to Delaware now.

01:09:55.940 --> 01:09:58.940
Wait, so these vans are just cruising about China?

01:09:58.940 --> 01:10:00.940
I don't know, ma'am.

01:10:00.940 --> 01:10:03.940
I just, I'm surprised I was right about that.

01:10:03.940 --> 01:10:05.940
It's pretty amazing, yeah.

01:10:05.940 --> 01:10:06.940
I just know stuff.

01:10:06.940 --> 01:10:08.940
I don't know what the fuck it's all about.

01:10:08.940 --> 01:10:14.940
Also, like, Spencer, if you're just plugging your upcoming band called Chinese Murder Band,

01:10:14.940 --> 01:10:17.940
just come out with it, because I will go to your show.

01:10:17.940 --> 01:10:27.940
It's less of a band and more of a live experience.

01:10:27.940 --> 01:10:30.940
Tomorrow night, Delaware Gas Fan.

01:10:30.940 --> 01:10:31.940
Do they still have bookmobiles?

01:10:31.940 --> 01:10:33.940
I suppose they don't anymore, right?

01:10:33.940 --> 01:10:35.940
No, because kids kept being murdered.

01:10:35.940 --> 01:10:41.940
They kept getting the Chinese bookmobiles, like, uh-oh.

01:10:41.940 --> 01:10:47.940
Chinese bookmobiles are a good name for a band.

01:10:47.940 --> 01:10:49.940
In the 70s, they had bookmobiles.

01:10:49.940 --> 01:10:52.940
Now the internet, I'm sure, makes us all obsolete, but it was, yeah.

01:10:52.940 --> 01:10:53.940
Did you guys have bookfairs?

01:10:53.940 --> 01:10:56.940
There were bookfairs at our school, you mean?

01:10:56.940 --> 01:10:59.940
Yeah, we had those, but that was fucking bullshit.

01:10:59.940 --> 01:11:00.940
That's people selling books.

01:11:00.940 --> 01:11:01.940
That's good.

01:11:01.940 --> 01:11:03.940
The only thing you could buy there was Madness and Nancy Drew.

01:11:03.940 --> 01:11:04.940
What do you think a bookmobile is?

01:11:04.940 --> 01:11:06.940
A bookmobile is a library.

01:11:06.940 --> 01:11:11.940
It's a public library on wheels, you low-road motherfucker.

01:11:11.940 --> 01:11:12.940
Damn, damn.

01:11:12.940 --> 01:11:15.940
Apologize, free prompt.

01:11:15.940 --> 01:11:23.940
I'm sorry that I high-roated you on my knowledge of 70s social programs.

01:11:23.940 --> 01:11:29.940
I am remorseful both because I'm your future husband and because it again

01:11:29.940 --> 01:11:33.940
hangs a lantern on our age difference.

01:11:33.940 --> 01:11:35.940
Lantern?

01:11:35.940 --> 01:11:40.940
Update Lantern.

01:11:40.940 --> 01:11:46.940
Oh, it hangs a glow stick.

01:11:46.940 --> 01:11:51.940
On the rave that is me being 12 years older than you.

01:11:51.940 --> 01:11:57.940
Cover me in the foam of, well, cover me in the Rogaine foam.

01:11:57.940 --> 01:12:06.940
My commitment to change will never happen again because Carter's almost dead.

01:12:06.940 --> 01:12:08.940
I'm not far behind.

01:12:08.940 --> 01:12:11.940
What do you know about Carter that I don't know?

01:12:11.940 --> 01:12:15.940
He has one of these.

01:12:15.940 --> 01:12:17.940
No, no, no.

01:12:17.940 --> 01:12:19.940
Nobody has that, that's just you.

01:12:19.940 --> 01:12:21.940
It's called a Carter.

01:12:21.940 --> 01:12:22.940
They told me.

01:12:22.940 --> 01:12:24.940
It's like a Lou Gehrig's thing.

01:12:24.940 --> 01:12:27.940
A Carter flap in my trachea.

01:12:27.940 --> 01:12:30.940
Morgan, do you ride horses?

01:12:30.940 --> 01:12:31.940
I do not, no.

01:12:31.940 --> 01:12:34.940
Oh, okay.

01:12:34.940 --> 01:12:37.940
Is there a for two?

01:12:37.940 --> 01:12:40.940
You're projecting so much under her.

01:12:40.940 --> 01:12:43.940
She's just a normal lady.

01:12:43.940 --> 01:12:46.940
Do you make your own yogurt?

01:12:46.940 --> 01:12:49.940
Do you make your own yogurt?

01:12:49.940 --> 01:12:51.940
I make my own cereals.

01:12:51.940 --> 01:12:56.940
That's like, have we ever had a hair wrap?

01:12:56.940 --> 01:12:58.940
No, don't let the cereal thing go.

01:12:58.940 --> 01:13:00.940
You make your own cereal?

01:13:00.940 --> 01:13:02.940
How do you make your own cereal?

01:13:02.940 --> 01:13:11.940
She puts each marshmallow in the, she hammers each lucky her shoe on an anvil.

01:13:11.940 --> 01:13:14.940
Catches a star from the sky.

01:13:14.940 --> 01:13:20.940
The actual base, base lucky charms you can get from any hobby store.

01:13:20.940 --> 01:13:22.940
But the good shit you have.

01:13:22.940 --> 01:13:23.940
Yeah, yeah.

01:13:23.940 --> 01:13:24.940
You toast oats.

01:13:24.940 --> 01:13:26.940
Oh, you toast oats?

01:13:26.940 --> 01:13:27.940
It's much easier.

01:13:27.940 --> 01:13:28.940
She toasts.

01:13:28.940 --> 01:13:30.940
Are you like a muesli person?

01:13:30.940 --> 01:13:31.940
Yeah.

01:13:31.940 --> 01:13:33.940
What is muesli?

01:13:33.940 --> 01:13:38.940
So I guess I can call it that, but I'll put in dates and raisins and it has sliced almonds.

01:13:38.940 --> 01:13:39.940
Yeah, cause you get nasty.

01:13:39.940 --> 01:13:42.940
Does anyone learn?

01:13:42.940 --> 01:13:44.940
I just came.

01:13:44.940 --> 01:13:46.940
I just came.

01:13:46.940 --> 01:13:48.940
Are they sugar dates?

01:13:48.940 --> 01:13:50.940
Yes.

01:13:50.940 --> 01:13:52.940
Oh shit.

01:13:52.940 --> 01:13:54.940
What do you mean?

01:13:54.940 --> 01:13:56.940
Are they sugar dates?

01:13:56.940 --> 01:13:58.940
Of course they're sugar dates.

01:13:58.940 --> 01:13:59.940
It's a date.

01:13:59.940 --> 01:14:00.940
What do you do?

01:14:00.940 --> 01:14:01.940
You eat them.

01:14:01.940 --> 01:14:02.940
I'm a graduate student.

01:14:02.940 --> 01:14:03.940
What are you studying?

01:14:03.940 --> 01:14:04.940
Nutrition.

01:14:04.940 --> 01:14:08.940
This is going to get so boring.

01:14:08.940 --> 01:14:10.940
It's called bioinformatics.

01:14:10.940 --> 01:14:11.940
Okay.

01:14:11.940 --> 01:14:12.940
Bio what?

01:14:12.940 --> 01:14:13.940
Bioinformatics.

01:14:13.940 --> 01:14:14.940
Bioinformatics?

01:14:14.940 --> 01:14:15.940
Yeah.

01:14:15.940 --> 01:14:16.940
Holy shit.

01:14:16.940 --> 01:14:17.940
Explain that to me because I have no idea what that means.

01:14:17.940 --> 01:14:20.940
That's a study of looking like you like horses and play guitar.

01:14:20.940 --> 01:14:21.940
Yeah.

01:14:21.940 --> 01:14:25.940
But if a child's trapped under a car you could flip it.

01:14:25.940 --> 01:14:28.940
You don't hate horses.

01:14:28.940 --> 01:14:32.940
Who hates horses?

01:14:32.940 --> 01:14:34.940
Some people hate horses.

01:14:34.940 --> 01:14:36.940
If you had more time you would write that.

01:14:36.940 --> 01:14:38.940
Tell me what bioinformatics are.

01:14:38.940 --> 01:14:43.940
Bioinformatics is where biology and computer science kind of mesh together.

01:14:43.940 --> 01:14:46.940
So it's computer science related to biology and healthcare.

01:14:46.940 --> 01:14:49.940
So how would you like to implement that?

01:14:49.940 --> 01:14:50.940
Implement.

01:14:50.940 --> 01:14:51.940
Bioinformatics.

01:14:51.940 --> 01:14:54.940
What's a practical like?

01:14:54.940 --> 01:14:55.940
It's a terminator.

01:14:55.940 --> 01:14:56.940
Cyborg.

01:14:56.940 --> 01:14:57.940
Cyborgs?

01:14:57.940 --> 01:15:02.940
You're creating a race of super serial horses.

01:15:02.940 --> 01:15:04.940
You got it.

01:15:04.940 --> 01:15:07.940
Who can play bridge over troubled waters.

01:15:07.940 --> 01:15:10.940
But Morgan, what would you dream gig be?

01:15:10.940 --> 01:15:11.940
Jurassic Park.

01:15:11.940 --> 01:15:12.940
Jurassic Park.

01:15:12.940 --> 01:15:13.940
I didn't ask you motherfuckers.

01:15:13.940 --> 01:15:14.940
Ask Morgan.

01:15:14.940 --> 01:15:16.940
You guys are too rowdy.

01:15:16.940 --> 01:15:21.940
I absolutely work with DNA sequencing data.

01:15:21.940 --> 01:15:24.940
Holy shit.

01:15:24.940 --> 01:15:31.940
So if we could do some DNA engineering that would be ideal.

01:15:31.940 --> 01:15:35.940
What would be the highest extension of that work?

01:15:35.940 --> 01:15:37.940
What would you like to create or do?

01:15:37.940 --> 01:15:38.940
Cloning.

01:15:38.940 --> 01:15:39.940
Cloning what?

01:15:39.940 --> 01:15:44.940
Bioengineering.

01:15:44.940 --> 01:15:47.940
Adam, shut up.

01:15:47.940 --> 01:15:49.940
What would you create?

01:15:49.940 --> 01:15:51.940
That's pretty far removed.

01:15:51.940 --> 01:15:52.940
What's the highest extension of that?

01:15:52.940 --> 01:15:57.940
What would you like to create?

01:15:57.940 --> 01:15:59.940
You mean like some kind of new species?

01:15:59.940 --> 01:16:00.940
You tell me.

01:16:00.940 --> 01:16:01.940
I have no idea.

01:16:01.940 --> 01:16:04.940
Yeah, I would absolutely create some kind of new species.

01:16:04.940 --> 01:16:05.940
A new species?

01:16:05.940 --> 01:16:07.940
Yeah, that would be able to survive on Mars instead of Earth.

01:16:07.940 --> 01:16:09.940
Would it be a mammal?

01:16:09.940 --> 01:16:10.940
No.

01:16:10.940 --> 01:16:11.940
Oh.

01:16:11.940 --> 01:16:12.940
What would it be?

01:16:12.940 --> 01:16:13.940
Like an insect.

01:16:13.940 --> 01:16:15.940
It could be cold-blooded, not on Mars.

01:16:15.940 --> 01:16:18.940
Yeah, it would certainly be something amazing.

01:16:18.940 --> 01:16:23.940
A cold-blooded species that could survive on the wastes of Mars atmosphere?

01:16:23.940 --> 01:16:25.940
It couldn't be cold-blooded.

01:16:25.940 --> 01:16:29.940
Not on Mars.

01:16:29.940 --> 01:16:34.940
If we had a Harmontown pin-up calendar, you may be on the cover.

01:16:34.940 --> 01:16:36.940
Do you have a boyfriend?

01:16:36.940 --> 01:16:37.940
I do, yeah.

01:16:37.940 --> 01:16:38.940
He's back here.

01:16:38.940 --> 01:16:40.940
Alright, never mind.

01:16:40.940 --> 01:16:42.940
He's a 14-foot cockroach.

01:16:42.940 --> 01:16:46.940
I'm glad I'm here.

01:16:46.940 --> 01:16:48.940
A cyber-cockroach.

01:16:48.940 --> 01:16:55.940
His name is Seventeen.

01:16:55.940 --> 01:16:57.940
So you want to create new species?

01:16:57.940 --> 01:17:04.940
She had 16 boyfriends that she made in her basement.

01:17:04.940 --> 01:17:08.940
Seventeen, I think you might be the one.

01:17:08.940 --> 01:17:11.940
Until you out-use your youthfulness.

01:17:11.940 --> 01:17:16.940
So you want to create a new species that might survive in outer space,

01:17:16.940 --> 01:17:18.940
or an extra-terrestrial?

01:17:18.940 --> 01:17:20.940
Yeah, I think that would be amazing.

01:17:20.940 --> 01:17:21.940
That is really cool.

01:17:21.940 --> 01:17:23.940
And so what life form do you think...

01:17:23.940 --> 01:17:26.940
When I hang out, we could be friends.

01:17:26.940 --> 01:17:29.940
What form, like Spencer asked, would it be a mammal?

01:17:29.940 --> 01:17:32.940
What kind of life do you think we could create first

01:17:32.940 --> 01:17:34.940
that would live on moss?

01:17:34.940 --> 01:17:35.940
First?

01:17:35.940 --> 01:17:36.940
Moss.

01:17:36.940 --> 01:17:37.940
Moss?

01:17:37.940 --> 01:17:38.940
Yeah.

01:17:38.940 --> 01:17:39.940
Are you trying to create moss right now?

01:17:39.940 --> 01:17:41.940
I'm not, no.

01:17:41.940 --> 01:17:42.940
But if you could, would you?

01:17:42.940 --> 01:17:44.940
Oh, yeah.

01:17:44.940 --> 01:17:47.940
I mean, wouldn't we all work out?

01:17:47.940 --> 01:17:49.940
Let's all just make moss.

01:17:49.940 --> 01:17:50.940
I love that.

01:17:50.940 --> 01:17:51.940
Come on, everybody knows.

01:17:51.940 --> 01:17:53.940
That's the first terrestrial life, right?

01:17:53.940 --> 01:17:56.940
Moss is like plants without capillary action.

01:17:56.940 --> 01:17:57.940
Like, there's nothing.

01:17:57.940 --> 01:18:01.940
Before anything, there's moss as far as open air stuff.

01:18:01.940 --> 01:18:03.940
How did you and your boyfriend meet?

01:18:03.940 --> 01:18:08.940
At Radio Shack.

01:18:08.940 --> 01:18:09.940
Oh, that's nice.

01:18:09.940 --> 01:18:11.940
So you guys have that shared there.

01:18:11.940 --> 01:18:12.940
That's cool.

01:18:12.940 --> 01:18:14.940
What was the shared thing I didn't hear?

01:18:14.940 --> 01:18:16.940
We were in the same department together.

01:18:16.940 --> 01:18:17.940
Oh, okay.

01:18:17.940 --> 01:18:18.940
So what...

01:18:18.940 --> 01:18:20.940
Did he ride horses, sir?

01:18:20.940 --> 01:18:23.940
No, not yet.

01:18:23.940 --> 01:18:26.940
Oh, not yet.

01:18:26.940 --> 01:18:28.940
Morgan, do you think horses could live on Mars?

01:18:28.940 --> 01:18:30.940
I hope so one day.

01:18:30.940 --> 01:18:31.940
Yeah.

01:18:31.940 --> 01:18:36.940
Aren't you worried about the moss becoming sentient and...

01:18:36.940 --> 01:18:37.940
That would be amazing.

01:18:37.940 --> 01:18:41.940
Well, yeah, I guess by the time, by the time whatever we create becomes sentient, like,

01:18:41.940 --> 01:18:43.940
we'll be God, right?

01:18:43.940 --> 01:18:44.940
And we'll be bored.

01:18:44.940 --> 01:18:47.940
And we'll be like, go ahead, kill us.

01:18:47.940 --> 01:18:50.940
We did it to our God.

01:18:50.940 --> 01:18:52.940
I saw this comment.

01:18:52.940 --> 01:18:54.940
I'll put my head on the block.

01:18:54.940 --> 01:18:59.940
Just, I swear, I gotta stop putting that apple tree in the garden.

01:18:59.940 --> 01:19:00.940
What was I thinking?

01:19:00.940 --> 01:19:01.940
What do you think?

01:19:01.940 --> 01:19:02.940
Like, what's your...

01:19:02.940 --> 01:19:03.940
Do you like Jurassic Park?

01:19:03.940 --> 01:19:04.940
What are your...

01:19:04.940 --> 01:19:06.940
Yeah, I like Jurassic Park.

01:19:06.940 --> 01:19:07.940
Do you...

01:19:07.940 --> 01:19:11.940
I think that it could be realistic.

01:19:11.940 --> 01:19:12.940
Yeah.

01:19:12.940 --> 01:19:13.940
Woo!

01:19:13.940 --> 01:19:14.940
Stop!

01:19:14.940 --> 01:19:17.940
What is that?

01:19:17.940 --> 01:19:19.940
There's an absolute...

01:19:19.940 --> 01:19:21.940
I hope that these people didn't come with Morgan.

01:19:21.940 --> 01:19:22.940
There's like a very...

01:19:22.940 --> 01:19:28.940
I was getting upset about the people yelling stuff out, but the thing is, there's like some

01:19:28.940 --> 01:19:32.940
very passionate dinosaur people.

01:19:32.940 --> 01:19:34.940
And they've committed to their role.

01:19:34.940 --> 01:19:37.940
Like, they keep bending every subject.

01:19:37.940 --> 01:19:38.940
Dinosaurs!

01:19:38.940 --> 01:19:39.940
The last raptor!

01:19:39.940 --> 01:19:42.940
Like a Jurassic Park!

01:19:42.940 --> 01:19:45.940
And there's like three of them and they're right over there.

01:19:45.940 --> 01:19:47.940
Jeff Goldblum's character.

01:19:47.940 --> 01:19:49.940
They're really into dinosaurs.

01:19:49.940 --> 01:19:50.940
They really went...

01:19:50.940 --> 01:19:51.940
Like, finds a way!

01:19:51.940 --> 01:19:52.940
Yes, yes.

01:19:52.940 --> 01:19:53.940
Yes.

01:19:53.940 --> 01:19:54.940
Yes.

01:19:54.940 --> 01:19:56.940
Must go faster.

01:19:56.940 --> 01:19:57.940
Must go faster.

01:19:57.940 --> 01:19:58.940
Cheetah speed.

01:19:58.940 --> 01:19:59.940
Cheetah speed.

01:19:59.940 --> 01:20:02.940
It's actually my college roommate who's screaming out.

01:20:02.940 --> 01:20:04.940
Life finds a way.

01:20:04.940 --> 01:20:10.940
It's actually an all-female Jurassic Park cover band called Clever Girl.

01:20:10.940 --> 01:20:15.940
God damn it, you cocksucker.

01:20:15.940 --> 01:20:16.940
What?

01:20:16.940 --> 01:20:17.940
Clever Girl.

01:20:17.940 --> 01:20:18.940
What?

01:20:18.940 --> 01:20:19.940
Clever Girl.

01:20:19.940 --> 01:20:20.940
Clever Girl.

01:20:20.940 --> 01:20:21.940
Clever Girl.

01:20:21.940 --> 01:20:22.940
Clever Girl.

01:20:22.940 --> 01:20:25.940
I'm in a band called Cheetah Speed.

01:20:25.940 --> 01:20:28.940
A guy shouted out Clever Girl.

01:20:28.940 --> 01:20:34.940
I'm in a band called The Mirrored Cabinets Make Me Nervous Who Knows When They're Gonna

01:20:34.940 --> 01:20:35.940
Attack.

01:20:35.940 --> 01:20:36.940
Clever Girl.

01:20:36.940 --> 01:20:37.940
Clever Girl.

01:20:37.940 --> 01:20:38.940
Clever Girl.

01:20:38.940 --> 01:20:39.940
Clever Girl.

01:20:39.940 --> 01:20:40.940
Clever Girl.

01:20:40.940 --> 01:20:46.940
I love the idea of having that much presence of mind upon your death by murder.

01:20:46.940 --> 01:20:49.940
Just admiring your murder art.

01:20:49.940 --> 01:20:51.940
I don't think that's ever happened in the history of...

01:20:51.940 --> 01:20:56.940
He spent the entire movie explaining to Jeff Goldblum and to everybody else.

01:20:56.940 --> 01:20:57.940
They hunt.

01:20:57.940 --> 01:20:59.940
They're not lizards.

01:20:59.940 --> 01:21:01.940
They hunt like they're people.

01:21:01.940 --> 01:21:03.940
They have huge brains.

01:21:03.940 --> 01:21:05.940
And they go over here.

01:21:05.940 --> 01:21:06.940
And he sees...

01:21:06.940 --> 01:21:09.940
That's all the more reason for him to not be amazed at that moment.

01:21:09.940 --> 01:21:11.940
He should be like, fuck, fuck.

01:21:11.940 --> 01:21:12.940
No.

01:21:12.940 --> 01:21:15.940
What am I, retarded?

01:21:15.940 --> 01:21:17.940
That's him being amazed.

01:21:17.940 --> 01:21:19.940
God damn it, I was right.

01:21:19.940 --> 01:21:21.940
He goes, Clever Girl, you son of a bitch.

01:21:21.940 --> 01:21:24.940
No, but he went, Clever Girl.

01:21:24.940 --> 01:21:26.940
Like, he was coming as he died.

01:21:26.940 --> 01:21:27.940
No.

01:21:27.940 --> 01:21:29.940
I'm so honored to be eaten this way.

01:21:29.940 --> 01:21:32.940
He's saying I slightly underestimated you.

01:21:32.940 --> 01:21:34.940
He should have said, you know what he should have said, and I would have bought this.

01:21:34.940 --> 01:21:35.940
Game recognized game.

01:21:35.940 --> 01:21:36.940
Game?

01:21:36.940 --> 01:21:45.940
Speaking of game recognized game, let's play some D&D.

01:21:49.940 --> 01:21:51.940
Yes, let's.

01:21:54.940 --> 01:22:01.940
When we last met, our heroes had burned their way through Bill Martigans and found themselves in an icy wasteland,

01:22:01.940 --> 01:22:05.940
trapped in a net and facing down a terrible yeti.

01:22:05.940 --> 01:22:09.940
But before they could escape, they were met with a familiar face.

01:22:09.940 --> 01:22:13.940
Tylenol with codeine, the unicorn had returned.

01:22:13.940 --> 01:22:19.940
The unicorn convinced the yeti to let our friends free, and together they adjourned to Tylenol's hideout in the snow.

01:22:19.940 --> 01:22:25.940
There they sucked on cinnamon toast and pop tarts and cocoa, and had a great, if dizzying, discussion

01:22:25.940 --> 01:22:30.940
which led, in a codeine-fueled bender, to the purple caverns of Tamarind.

01:22:30.940 --> 01:22:35.940
In the caverns, Tylenol bit them onward towards strange and magical gems,

01:22:35.940 --> 01:22:39.940
and as they did so, the gems transformed into creatures.

01:22:39.940 --> 01:22:43.940
Squark smashed one of them, and Sharpie ensnared the others,

01:22:43.940 --> 01:22:47.940
and the gang began to wonder about the sanity of their friend Tylenol.

01:22:47.940 --> 01:22:51.940
But then Sharpie took a shit on the floor.

01:22:51.940 --> 01:22:55.940
Would our heroes be able to stomach the foul stench?

01:22:55.940 --> 01:23:02.940
Were the crystalline critters indeed wondrous treasure? Was the unicorn still around, or had he disappeared?

01:23:02.940 --> 01:23:09.940
Find out next time on an exciting new edition of Harmontown, today, right now.

01:23:11.940 --> 01:23:16.940
If the unicorn, if Tylenol's still there, we could have Demorge come up and play him.

01:23:16.940 --> 01:23:18.940
Demorge, are you here?

01:23:18.940 --> 01:23:21.940
Demorge Brown at the stage, please.

01:23:21.940 --> 01:23:24.940
Unless you just wanted to have him evaporate.

01:23:24.940 --> 01:23:25.940
It's all good.

01:23:25.940 --> 01:23:28.940
Demorge, you should play Mulrainee.

01:23:28.940 --> 01:23:32.940
It's Demorge Brown, Harmontown regular.

01:23:32.940 --> 01:23:35.940
Soccer enthusiast.

01:23:35.940 --> 01:23:37.940
That is correct.

01:23:37.940 --> 01:23:39.940
How was my sports corner?

01:23:39.940 --> 01:23:43.940
It was informative, in a way.

01:23:43.940 --> 01:23:48.940
I was impressed that you got the teams right.

01:23:48.940 --> 01:23:54.940
Right now, these creatures have turned into gems, and we started kicking their butts, right?

01:23:54.940 --> 01:23:57.940
There's these gems that turned into creatures, really.

01:23:57.940 --> 01:23:58.940
That's what it is.

01:23:58.940 --> 01:24:03.940
They're all tied up in Sharpie's ropes, or his vines, rather.

01:24:03.940 --> 01:24:05.940
They're not moving, they're tied up.

01:24:05.940 --> 01:24:07.940
It's as if they're in a net.

01:24:07.940 --> 01:24:14.940
Morgan, you're going to play Christopher, and Demorge, you're going to play Tylenol Cody.

01:24:14.940 --> 01:24:16.940
Unicorn.

01:24:16.940 --> 01:24:21.940
And you're real sassy.

01:24:21.940 --> 01:24:27.940
I wonder what Barack Obama would say about Chinese murder vans.

01:24:27.940 --> 01:24:31.940
Well, look.

01:24:31.940 --> 01:24:43.940
Theoretically speaking, if there's a van with murderous equipment inside of it,

01:24:43.940 --> 01:24:47.940
there has to be a driver.

01:24:47.940 --> 01:24:53.940
The legal question, just going by my background in civil rights and constitutional law,

01:24:53.940 --> 01:25:03.940
is the driver separate from the one pulling the strings?

01:25:03.940 --> 01:25:05.940
What I've done is convene a committee to convene a committee,

01:25:05.940 --> 01:25:11.940
and we're going to reach out across the aisle to some good folks.

01:25:11.940 --> 01:25:15.940
See if we can't get to the bottom of this issue,

01:25:15.940 --> 01:25:19.940
and when we do, we'll certainly come forward and talk more in depth about that.

01:25:19.940 --> 01:25:27.940
What I'm not prepared to do at this time is go on the record about whether or not

01:25:27.940 --> 01:25:34.940
murder vans exist in this country.

01:25:34.940 --> 01:25:42.940
Do you have to define murder? Do you have to define ban?

01:25:42.940 --> 01:25:51.940
Anybody in good citizens with information about this need to hit us up at whitehouse.gov.

01:25:51.940 --> 01:25:56.940
For a limited time, we're giving away White House sugar cookies.

01:25:56.940 --> 01:26:00.940
What goes on at whitehouse.gov? What's the website like? What's the splash page?

01:26:00.940 --> 01:26:07.940
It's really cool. You get to pilot a drone over Kansas, and you can just monitor people.

01:26:07.940 --> 01:26:17.940
Let me be clear about that. That is a simulator.

01:26:17.940 --> 01:26:25.940
It's not an actual drone, but it is a good way, using URLs to track back and find people,

01:26:25.940 --> 01:26:31.940
addresses, and things who are qualified and are good, and we need good people to pilot drones.

01:26:31.940 --> 01:26:38.940
Once again, we've got your information, we'll find you.

01:26:38.940 --> 01:26:40.940
Thank you, Barack.

01:26:40.940 --> 01:26:44.940
He's a good guy. He's very folksy.

01:26:44.940 --> 01:26:47.940
He's kind of fake folksy. He sounds folksy.

01:26:47.940 --> 01:26:54.940
He's folksy? He's erudite? I'm not sure where he was born.

01:26:54.940 --> 01:26:56.940
But he feels American.

01:26:56.940 --> 01:27:01.940
Barack, can we take this moment at Harmontown? No one's listening. No one's recording.

01:27:01.940 --> 01:27:03.940
Can we learn where exactly...

01:27:03.940 --> 01:27:05.940
No one's listening. Everybody's listening.

01:27:05.940 --> 01:27:07.940
What your citizenship actually is?

01:27:07.940 --> 01:27:13.940
Well, look, I'll do this one last time.

01:27:13.940 --> 01:27:18.940
I was born in a hospital.

01:27:18.940 --> 01:27:22.940
Thank you.

01:27:22.940 --> 01:27:27.940
It comes up from time to time, and a fellow asked me if I was an eggplant.

01:27:27.940 --> 01:27:33.940
Look, man, you've got to do your own due diligence on this stuff.

01:27:33.940 --> 01:27:38.940
For the last time, born in a hospital, ate Gerber food as a child.

01:27:38.940 --> 01:27:45.940
I don't even think you can get that in Canada, so I think you know where I'm from.

01:27:45.940 --> 01:27:50.940
You seem more and more evasive. The more questions we ask, the more evasive it becomes.

01:27:50.940 --> 01:27:53.940
Well, wouldn't you? It's more fun.

01:27:53.940 --> 01:27:56.940
It's more fun? It's more fun.

01:27:56.940 --> 01:27:58.940
Yeah, I like that.

01:27:58.940 --> 01:28:02.940
Jeff, are you leading us towards being a birther podcast?

01:28:02.940 --> 01:28:08.940
Yes. Oh, dude, I'm a fucking way birther from way back.

01:28:08.940 --> 01:28:10.940
I'm a diet in the whole...

01:28:10.940 --> 01:28:14.940
Carry me out in a box birther.

01:28:14.940 --> 01:28:22.940
Now that you find out I'm a fucking hardline right-winger.

01:28:22.940 --> 01:28:25.940
Yes, I'm a Jeff-winger.

01:28:25.940 --> 01:28:29.940
That's Adam Goldberg being hacked in the audience, so they're repeating him.

01:28:29.940 --> 01:28:33.940
Jeff or Adam is particularly drunk.

01:28:33.940 --> 01:28:35.940
Yeah.

01:28:35.940 --> 01:28:37.940
Adam, are you fucked up right now?

01:28:37.940 --> 01:28:42.940
Oh, dear God.

01:28:42.940 --> 01:28:45.940
It doesn't enhance your personality.

01:28:45.940 --> 01:28:49.940
All right, Spencer.

01:28:49.940 --> 01:28:51.940
Duly noted.

01:28:51.940 --> 01:28:55.940
Spencer, okay, so what are we looking at right now? Describe our surroundings.

01:28:55.940 --> 01:29:01.940
You're in the purple caverns. Behind you is the cavern exit. It goes into the purple canyon.

01:29:01.940 --> 01:29:10.940
Before you is a pile of crushed sapphire and also a ruby red crab and an emerald beetle.

01:29:10.940 --> 01:29:15.940
They're tied up in vines, as I said earlier. They've been tied up.

01:29:15.940 --> 01:29:18.940
You tied them up last week.

01:29:18.940 --> 01:29:20.940
Were they animate?

01:29:20.940 --> 01:29:23.940
They were. They were animating right towards you.

01:29:23.940 --> 01:29:26.940
Sorry. Dad was a little drunk last week.

01:29:26.940 --> 01:29:33.940
I mean, no judgments.

01:29:33.940 --> 01:29:37.940
I tied these crabs up because they have ill intent.

01:29:37.940 --> 01:29:40.940
They certainly seemed that way.

01:29:40.940 --> 01:29:44.940
All right, let's kill the remaining gem beetles.

01:29:44.940 --> 01:29:47.940
You want to lead the attack, Sharpie?

01:29:47.940 --> 01:29:49.940
Sure.

01:29:49.940 --> 01:29:51.940
By the power of...

01:29:51.940 --> 01:29:53.940
Greyskull.

01:29:53.940 --> 01:29:58.940
What do you do, Adam Goldberg?

01:29:58.940 --> 01:30:01.940
No, I would have said that.

01:30:01.940 --> 01:30:06.940
Gently.

01:30:06.940 --> 01:30:15.940
Boy, I feel like it's been ages since I've recharged my...

01:30:15.940 --> 01:30:19.940
I think Ray of Frost is like a zero level spell that does like zero to two damage.

01:30:19.940 --> 01:30:20.940
Sure is.

01:30:20.940 --> 01:30:24.940
Sharpie, real quick, why are we in this cave right now?

01:30:24.940 --> 01:30:26.940
Dude, ask them.

01:30:26.940 --> 01:30:27.940
And what are we doing?

01:30:27.940 --> 01:30:32.940
Greg Proups played Tylenol with Koenini, whisked us off to this purple cave.

01:30:32.940 --> 01:30:41.940
Spencer just sat there listening as Proups basically DM'd.

01:30:41.940 --> 01:30:43.940
I feel like I helped.

01:30:43.940 --> 01:30:46.940
No, no, no, I wasn't disparaging.

01:30:46.940 --> 01:30:48.940
Spencer and Greg just invent that cave?

01:30:48.940 --> 01:30:51.940
You know, it's a cave.

01:30:51.940 --> 01:30:52.940
I didn't know that.

01:30:52.940 --> 01:30:57.940
It's a wide world, this Dungeons and Dragons place.

01:30:57.940 --> 01:31:02.940
We were just whisked off to this place and we just kind of like, yeah, we don't know what we're doing here

01:31:02.940 --> 01:31:05.940
and there's these crab beetles, gem things.

01:31:05.940 --> 01:31:10.940
I just, god damn it, do I have Scorching Ray? Is that depleted?

01:31:10.940 --> 01:31:12.940
Yes, it's not depleted.

01:31:12.940 --> 01:31:13.940
You have it.

01:31:13.940 --> 01:31:19.940
Scorching Ray on the nearest gem crab beetle.

01:31:19.940 --> 01:31:22.940
You were in a blackout last time, weren't you?

01:31:22.940 --> 01:31:25.940
Would seem so.

01:31:25.940 --> 01:31:32.940
You blast it with a scorching ray and it seems to be burned to a kind of rocky crisp

01:31:32.940 --> 01:31:36.940
just as all black and cloudy and doesn't move anymore.

01:31:36.940 --> 01:31:39.940
Clever girl.

01:31:39.940 --> 01:31:42.940
Does it count when you're killing something?

01:31:42.940 --> 01:31:44.940
Maybe.

01:31:44.940 --> 01:31:49.940
There's one thing left, it's also tied up and not moving.

01:31:49.940 --> 01:31:51.940
One of you guys do the honors.

01:31:51.940 --> 01:31:53.940
What does it look like?

01:31:53.940 --> 01:31:56.940
A green beetle made of emerald.

01:31:56.940 --> 01:32:04.940
I take my mighty great sword and I just do a vertical slice down the middle of it.

01:32:04.940 --> 01:32:09.940
Yeah, it's pretty much immobile so you do that and slice it right in half.

01:32:09.940 --> 01:32:14.940
It doesn't move anymore, it's just two hunks of an emerald beetle.

01:32:14.940 --> 01:32:16.940
Is it already dead?

01:32:16.940 --> 01:32:19.940
It is now.

01:32:19.940 --> 01:32:22.940
I examine the loot.

01:32:22.940 --> 01:32:25.940
It's definitely made out of some form of emerald.

01:32:25.940 --> 01:32:30.940
It might be worth money if you sold it to someone who is into that.

01:32:30.940 --> 01:32:34.940
Everybody scoop all this shit up because we were on a million adventures

01:32:34.940 --> 01:32:38.940
and then the last time we tried to buy a hot dog and then we were broke

01:32:38.940 --> 01:32:41.940
because we never bothered to pick up any of this shit.

01:32:41.940 --> 01:32:44.940
We spend a turn picking all this shit up.

01:32:44.940 --> 01:32:48.940
You pick all this shit up.

01:32:48.940 --> 01:32:50.940
You put it in a bag or whatever.

01:32:50.940 --> 01:32:53.940
A tiny goes in a big bag of holding.

01:32:53.940 --> 01:32:56.940
That happens.

01:32:56.940 --> 01:32:58.940
Alright, we're rich.

01:32:58.940 --> 01:32:59.940
Are we?

01:32:59.940 --> 01:33:03.940
Well you have items that might be worth value if traded.

01:33:03.940 --> 01:33:08.940
Looks like having a lot of sugar or something.

01:33:08.940 --> 01:33:13.940
I look around the purple cavern for an exit, not the one we came in.

01:33:13.940 --> 01:33:15.940
You see it seems to go deeper in.

01:33:15.940 --> 01:33:19.940
There's a dark crack that makes it, you know, there's no light in it.

01:33:19.940 --> 01:33:21.940
There's a dark crack.

01:33:21.940 --> 01:33:23.940
I examine that crack.

01:33:23.940 --> 01:33:25.940
It's so dark you can't see.

01:33:25.940 --> 01:33:28.940
I sniff the crack.

01:33:28.940 --> 01:33:33.940
It smells like metal, like metal.

01:33:33.940 --> 01:33:36.940
Metal crack.

01:33:36.940 --> 01:33:39.940
I use my goggles at my nude scene.

01:33:39.940 --> 01:33:41.940
Yeah.

01:33:41.940 --> 01:33:45.940
You see the crack up really close.

01:33:45.940 --> 01:33:49.940
I turn around and go, waste of time.

01:33:49.940 --> 01:33:51.940
Mage light.

01:33:51.940 --> 01:33:53.940
You light it up.

01:33:53.940 --> 01:33:57.940
You see it's like maybe within this crack you might be able to squeeze through

01:33:57.940 --> 01:34:01.940
but there's like a seven foot space that kind of goes around a bend.

01:34:01.940 --> 01:34:04.940
It's like a, you know, like a corner or something.

01:34:04.940 --> 01:34:05.940
Through the crack?

01:34:05.940 --> 01:34:09.940
Yeah, so it's like there's a little space and then it rounds a bend.

01:34:09.940 --> 01:34:11.940
Is it big enough for a gnome to fit through?

01:34:11.940 --> 01:34:12.940
Definitely.

01:34:12.940 --> 01:34:14.940
I crawl through that crack.

01:34:14.940 --> 01:34:17.940
And you see there's this little bend I talked about earlier.

01:34:17.940 --> 01:34:18.940
I round that bend.

01:34:18.940 --> 01:34:23.940
The venture rounds the bend in what you see astonishes and frightens you.

01:34:23.940 --> 01:34:34.940
You see sitting upon a raised stone flat or a platform, a massive, it must be at least fully grown adult black dragon.

01:34:34.940 --> 01:34:39.940
It must be half asleep, if not more than half asleep.

01:34:39.940 --> 01:34:42.940
Have you seen any dragons come back?

01:34:42.940 --> 01:34:49.940
I go back to our campaign and I say this, there's a sleeping black dragon over there.

01:34:49.940 --> 01:34:56.940
Are they worse than regular dragons or is that just...

01:34:56.940 --> 01:34:59.940
Can I use my ability to detect evil?

01:34:59.940 --> 01:35:07.940
You use your ability to detect evil. You detect evil.

01:35:07.940 --> 01:35:11.940
Racist.

01:35:11.940 --> 01:35:18.940
Alright guys, we got an evil black dragon sleeping on a slab over there.

01:35:18.940 --> 01:35:21.940
They should mention white dragons are evil too.

01:35:21.940 --> 01:35:25.940
Are all dragons, is there a color of dragon that's not evil?

01:35:25.940 --> 01:35:27.940
Golden dragons.

01:35:27.940 --> 01:35:36.940
But don't they have mobile murder vans?

01:35:36.940 --> 01:35:41.940
Look, I'm just a white dragon, all I know is racist.

01:35:41.940 --> 01:35:44.940
He's trying to figure out which race is worse.

01:35:44.940 --> 01:35:50.940
Can we send Codeine with Tylenol in there? He's a magic unicorn.

01:35:50.940 --> 01:35:55.940
Can I reduce him with my shrinky person thing?

01:35:55.940 --> 01:35:56.940
Who?

01:35:56.940 --> 01:35:57.940
Won't work on Tylenol?

01:35:57.940 --> 01:36:00.940
No, he's a magical beast.

01:36:00.940 --> 01:36:02.940
So are you by the way?

01:36:02.940 --> 01:36:04.940
I wish.

01:36:04.940 --> 01:36:06.940
Can I fit with the crack?

01:36:06.940 --> 01:36:10.940
Yeah, you can. I don't think Tylenol can fit through.

01:36:10.940 --> 01:36:12.940
It's not a horse-sized crack.

01:36:12.940 --> 01:36:22.940
Okay, I'm going to take some pieces of my rope,

01:36:22.940 --> 01:36:25.940
and I'm going to take the red paint from my craft supplies

01:36:25.940 --> 01:36:28.940
and I'm going to splatter it all over me like I've been injured.

01:36:28.940 --> 01:36:31.940
Wait, what are you doing with the rope though?

01:36:31.940 --> 01:36:34.940
Like, I've been restrained, but I broke them free.

01:36:34.940 --> 01:36:37.940
So I'm going to take the ropes, I'm going to wrap them around my hands,

01:36:37.940 --> 01:36:40.940
but I'm going to cut them down the middle so it looks like someone's freed me.

01:36:40.940 --> 01:36:41.940
Okay.

01:36:41.940 --> 01:36:43.940
Okay.

01:36:43.940 --> 01:36:44.940
Scoops.

01:36:44.940 --> 01:36:45.940
What?

01:36:45.940 --> 01:36:53.940
If you go in there and try to like run some kind of quick change game on a black dragon,

01:36:53.940 --> 01:36:55.940
no one else can fit through the crack.

01:36:55.940 --> 01:36:58.940
I can. I'm going to know if I can fit through it.

01:36:58.940 --> 01:37:01.940
I can't get through there. Well, I could teleport through there maybe.

01:37:01.940 --> 01:37:03.940
But let's talk about this.

01:37:03.940 --> 01:37:06.940
It's not an episode of the Brady Bunch.

01:37:06.940 --> 01:37:09.940
We're not gluing a vase back together.

01:37:09.940 --> 01:37:11.940
What's our end game?

01:37:11.940 --> 01:37:14.940
You've got to share with us. What are you doing?

01:37:14.940 --> 01:37:17.940
Well, I'm going to slip through the crack,

01:37:17.940 --> 01:37:27.940
and then I'm going to pretend that I've just been tortured by people who hate the black dragon.

01:37:27.940 --> 01:37:29.940
But I love the black dragon.

01:37:29.940 --> 01:37:31.940
And I come in and I say, like, are you okay?

01:37:31.940 --> 01:37:36.940
Like, I got free.

01:37:36.940 --> 01:37:43.940
Where are you vulnerable?

01:37:43.940 --> 01:37:48.940
Guys, this is crazy enough to work.

01:37:48.940 --> 01:37:55.940
If only God was six, all of your plans would always work.

01:37:55.940 --> 01:37:58.940
That'll be the name of my autobiography.

01:37:58.940 --> 01:38:01.940
Are you there, God? And can't you be six?

01:38:01.940 --> 01:38:04.940
So some of my hair braids' beams can work.

01:38:04.940 --> 01:38:07.940
But I'm going to really, I'll slather it on.

01:38:07.940 --> 01:38:11.940
I'm a charming elf.

01:38:11.940 --> 01:38:13.940
Half elf.

01:38:13.940 --> 01:38:15.940
Do you speak draconic?

01:38:15.940 --> 01:38:16.940
What?

01:38:16.940 --> 01:38:17.940
Do you speak draconic?

01:38:17.940 --> 01:38:19.940
Toads?

01:38:19.940 --> 01:38:21.940
Do you speak draconic, somebody asked?

01:38:21.940 --> 01:38:22.940
Do you speak dragon?

01:38:22.940 --> 01:38:27.940
Look at your sheets.

01:38:27.940 --> 01:38:28.940
There's an answer.

01:38:28.940 --> 01:38:32.940
Your sheet is the thing with vodka spilled on it.

01:38:32.940 --> 01:38:35.940
I don't technically speak draconic,

01:38:35.940 --> 01:38:41.940
but I think I speak emotions.

01:38:41.940 --> 01:38:45.940
Yeah, like evil dragons do.

01:38:45.940 --> 01:38:48.940
I speak elvish and I speak common.

01:38:48.940 --> 01:38:52.940
Maybe this dragon, does the dragons speak common?

01:38:52.940 --> 01:38:53.940
You don't know.

01:38:53.940 --> 01:38:57.940
Dragons are highly intelligent beings, you know.

01:38:57.940 --> 01:39:00.940
I feel like a lot of times we feel compelled to do things

01:39:00.940 --> 01:39:06.940
just because it seems like we could.

01:39:06.940 --> 01:39:08.940
And we don't stop to think if we should.

01:39:08.940 --> 01:39:16.940
Am I right, dinosaur people?

01:39:16.940 --> 01:39:18.940
The great thing about Dungeons and Dragons

01:39:18.940 --> 01:39:20.940
is as opposed to a video game or a pop-up book

01:39:20.940 --> 01:39:23.940
you read to your kid in bed, like,

01:39:23.940 --> 01:39:27.940
there's no, we could fucking walk away.

01:39:27.940 --> 01:39:30.940
This dragon is a whole crack away from us.

01:39:30.940 --> 01:39:32.940
We can actually shout through the crack,

01:39:32.940 --> 01:39:35.940
fuck you, black dragons suck, and walk away.

01:39:35.940 --> 01:39:38.940
Is that how you want to live your life, Sharpie?

01:39:38.940 --> 01:39:43.940
Avoiding every dragon and walking away from every emerald beetle?

01:39:43.940 --> 01:39:45.940
I killed the emerald beetles.

01:39:45.940 --> 01:39:47.940
He'd show me the emerald beetle.

01:39:47.940 --> 01:39:51.940
I'll fucking slay it like a master born into the task.

01:39:51.940 --> 01:39:53.940
It's a black dragon.

01:39:53.940 --> 01:39:55.940
We're constantly getting our asses kicked

01:39:55.940 --> 01:39:59.940
and doing bad things to good people.

01:39:59.940 --> 01:40:04.940
It's just, like, our life has become a waking nightmare.

01:40:04.940 --> 01:40:07.940
Outside this purple cavern is a wasteland.

01:40:07.940 --> 01:40:09.940
It's a snowy wasteland.

01:40:09.940 --> 01:40:11.940
Well, that was weeks away.

01:40:11.940 --> 01:40:13.940
You're out of the frozen.

01:40:13.940 --> 01:40:15.940
It's a lot warmer now.

01:40:15.940 --> 01:40:17.940
I say we walk up the front door.

01:40:17.940 --> 01:40:19.940
Like men.

01:40:19.940 --> 01:40:21.940
Powerfully men.

01:40:21.940 --> 01:40:24.940
We leave sleeping dragons lie.

01:40:24.940 --> 01:40:26.940
He's not going anywhere.

01:40:26.940 --> 01:40:30.940
He's going to be just as dragon-y, just as black.

01:40:30.940 --> 01:40:32.940
Just as behind a tiny crab.

01:40:32.940 --> 01:40:34.940
Where are we going?

01:40:34.940 --> 01:40:37.940
I'm Maya Angelou.

01:40:37.940 --> 01:40:40.940
Lie.

01:40:40.940 --> 01:40:42.940
Too soon?

01:40:42.940 --> 01:40:44.940
I can ride him out of there.

01:40:44.940 --> 01:40:49.940
I'm just suggesting that we're not ready for this boss level.

01:40:49.940 --> 01:40:51.940
All right, fine.

01:40:51.940 --> 01:40:53.940
I jump on Tylenol with Coding's back.

01:40:53.940 --> 01:40:54.940
And I say,

01:40:54.940 --> 01:40:56.940
We're PA!

01:40:56.940 --> 01:40:59.940
You do that.

01:40:59.940 --> 01:41:01.940
And it gets it.

01:41:01.940 --> 01:41:05.940
Can the rest of them get on me?

01:41:05.940 --> 01:41:07.940
Yeah, yeah.

01:41:07.940 --> 01:41:09.940
We have a sturdy frame.

01:41:09.940 --> 01:41:13.940
Okay, we all get on Tylenol's back and I raise.

01:41:13.940 --> 01:41:15.940
We just see a black dragon and go,

01:41:15.940 --> 01:41:18.940
Well, Jeff, I mean, what's your name?

01:41:18.940 --> 01:41:20.940
Can we talk about what we want?

01:41:20.940 --> 01:41:23.940
If she wants to go in there, can I use my amulet of magic?

01:41:23.940 --> 01:41:25.940
No, no, my amulet.

01:41:25.940 --> 01:41:28.940
My magic circle against evil offered to her

01:41:28.940 --> 01:41:30.940
or protect her in some way with that.

01:41:30.940 --> 01:41:33.940
You can, but it's like centered on you.

01:41:33.940 --> 01:41:35.940
And since you can't fit in that room,

01:41:35.940 --> 01:41:37.940
it won't help very much.

01:41:37.940 --> 01:41:39.940
Gentlemen, if you guys want to die.

01:41:39.940 --> 01:41:41.940
Gentlemen, I call a roundup.

01:41:41.940 --> 01:41:43.940
All right.

01:41:43.940 --> 01:41:45.940
A roundup?

01:41:45.940 --> 01:41:51.940
Adventurers' code dictates no one can refuse a roundup call.

01:41:51.940 --> 01:41:55.940
Also, there has to be a barbecue at some point.

01:41:55.940 --> 01:41:57.940
There will be if we want to.

01:41:57.940 --> 01:42:00.940
I fashion an old-timey triangle and I ring a dinner bell.

01:42:00.940 --> 01:42:03.940
I present some beef.

01:42:03.940 --> 01:42:05.940
Gentlemen.

01:42:05.940 --> 01:42:07.940
Are there buttermilk biscuits to eat?

01:42:07.940 --> 01:42:09.940
Yes.

01:42:09.940 --> 01:42:13.940
Right now, I feel like we're a little aimless,

01:42:13.940 --> 01:42:15.940
but I know that...

01:42:15.940 --> 01:42:17.940
There's a dragon in the crack.

01:42:17.940 --> 01:42:19.940
I know that there's a dragon in the crack.

01:42:19.940 --> 01:42:22.940
I also know that recently baby plans were presented.

01:42:22.940 --> 01:42:24.940
What?

01:42:24.940 --> 01:42:27.940
Remember when we stole baby plans?

01:42:27.940 --> 01:42:29.940
And a baby robot.

01:42:29.940 --> 01:42:31.940
Yeah, we have a baby robot.

01:42:31.940 --> 01:42:34.940
And maybe this is crazy.

01:42:34.940 --> 01:42:36.940
Maybe you'll also be on board.

01:42:36.940 --> 01:42:39.940
But what if we made a town of babies?

01:42:39.940 --> 01:42:41.940
What?

01:42:41.940 --> 01:42:43.940
Because we have nothing else going on.

01:42:43.940 --> 01:42:45.940
Or what is...

01:42:45.940 --> 01:42:48.940
I mean, or what's happening.

01:42:48.940 --> 01:42:50.940
But imagine a town of babies.

01:42:50.940 --> 01:42:52.940
There's a baker baby.

01:42:52.940 --> 01:42:54.940
I like that.

01:42:54.940 --> 01:42:56.940
I like that.

01:42:56.940 --> 01:42:58.940
Can I use this amulet of shadow whirling to see if there is one out there?

01:42:58.940 --> 01:43:00.940
Is that what that does?

01:43:00.940 --> 01:43:02.940
It'll take you to the shadow world,

01:43:02.940 --> 01:43:05.940
but you don't think there's a baby village there?

01:43:05.940 --> 01:43:07.940
We'd make our own.

01:43:07.940 --> 01:43:09.940
I like the idea of settling down

01:43:09.940 --> 01:43:13.940
and creating for a change instead of destroying.

01:43:13.940 --> 01:43:16.940
We've been through so much and we've hurt so many.

01:43:16.940 --> 01:43:19.940
I feel like this is a sleeping dragon.

01:43:19.940 --> 01:43:21.940
You know that dragons have all kinds of loot?

01:43:21.940 --> 01:43:23.940
They're always sitting on some sort of crazy treasure chest.

01:43:23.940 --> 01:43:27.940
Jeff, there's a dragon in every crack.

01:43:27.940 --> 01:43:29.940
And there always will be.

01:43:29.940 --> 01:43:32.940
Chris de Burgh, what do you think?

01:43:32.940 --> 01:43:34.940
I say we should get out of here.

01:43:34.940 --> 01:43:36.940
To make a baby town?

01:43:36.940 --> 01:43:38.940
To make a baby town!

01:43:38.940 --> 01:43:41.940
Imagine an entire town of babies.

01:43:41.940 --> 01:43:43.940
That do bioinformatics.

01:43:43.940 --> 01:43:45.940
And then granola.

01:43:45.940 --> 01:43:47.940
Exactly.

01:43:47.940 --> 01:43:50.940
We could add some dinosaurs.

01:43:50.940 --> 01:43:52.940
Maybe we make tall babies.

01:43:52.940 --> 01:43:55.940
That's terrifying.

01:43:55.940 --> 01:43:59.940
Never mind. That's the worst idea I've ever had.

01:43:59.940 --> 01:44:01.940
That's an awful idea.

01:44:01.940 --> 01:44:04.940
Giant babies, like the little bodies, but with long legs.

01:44:04.940 --> 01:44:06.940
And they're sophisticated.

01:44:06.940 --> 01:44:08.940
Close encounters.

01:44:08.940 --> 01:44:11.940
Quark, what if we tie a rope around you

01:44:11.940 --> 01:44:13.940
and let you go in the crack?

01:44:13.940 --> 01:44:16.940
You go talk to the dragon.

01:44:16.940 --> 01:44:18.940
I'll yank you back.

01:44:18.940 --> 01:44:20.940
The dragon in the crack.

01:44:20.940 --> 01:44:21.940
What?

01:44:21.940 --> 01:44:23.940
The dragon in the crack.

01:44:23.940 --> 01:44:26.940
Because I don't want you to be unhappy.

01:44:26.940 --> 01:44:29.940
Did you already know that he was evil?

01:44:29.940 --> 01:44:31.940
We detected him.

01:44:31.940 --> 01:44:34.940
I want Chris de Burgh to come with me because he's the thief.

01:44:34.940 --> 01:44:37.940
He's the most stealthy among us.

01:44:37.940 --> 01:44:39.940
Can I fit?

01:44:39.940 --> 01:44:41.940
Yeah.

01:44:41.940 --> 01:44:43.940
Everybody in each room can fit.

01:44:43.940 --> 01:44:46.940
I crawl back through the crack.

01:44:46.940 --> 01:44:49.940
I just poke my head around and see what else I see beside a sleeping dragon.

01:44:49.940 --> 01:44:51.940
You'd see pretty much nothing else.

01:44:51.940 --> 01:44:55.940
It's otherwise a barren cavern that has no other exits or entrances.

01:44:55.940 --> 01:44:58.940
And there's nothing that looks like a treasure chest or anything sexy?

01:44:58.940 --> 01:45:00.940
Not even a little.

01:45:00.940 --> 01:45:02.940
You guys see a treasure chest or anything?

01:45:02.940 --> 01:45:04.940
I'm kidding, I don't really do that.

01:45:04.940 --> 01:45:07.940
I crawl back through the crack and go, Jesus Christ, keep it down.

01:45:07.940 --> 01:45:09.940
All right.

01:45:09.940 --> 01:45:11.940
I say, all right, look, you're right.

01:45:11.940 --> 01:45:13.940
There's only a diamond in the crack.

01:45:13.940 --> 01:45:15.940
Sunroof top.

01:45:15.940 --> 01:45:17.940
Dig in the scene.

01:45:17.940 --> 01:45:19.940
With the gang, surely.

01:45:19.940 --> 01:45:21.940
I didn't understand that reference.

01:45:21.940 --> 01:45:23.940
I didn't understand that reference.

01:45:23.940 --> 01:45:25.940
Dragon in the crack.

01:45:25.940 --> 01:45:33.940
I'll bet you 10,000 flurbos, whatever the fucking currency is.

01:45:33.940 --> 01:45:37.940
You don't have 10,000 flurbos.

01:45:37.940 --> 01:45:40.940
That we go out of this purple cave.

01:45:40.940 --> 01:45:44.940
We're going to find some settlement or township.

01:45:44.940 --> 01:45:48.940
And they're going to go, I'll give you a million flurbos.

01:45:48.940 --> 01:45:50.940
If you kill that black dragon.

01:45:50.940 --> 01:45:53.940
And we're going to get to sleep, recharge our spells.

01:45:53.940 --> 01:45:55.940
Well, and that sounds like so much fun.

01:45:59.940 --> 01:46:01.940
Wait, but you wanted to make a baby village.

01:46:01.940 --> 01:46:03.940
I'm trying to help you.

01:46:03.940 --> 01:46:05.940
You also wanted to walk into the crack.

01:46:05.940 --> 01:46:07.940
Walk into the crack, motherfucker.

01:46:07.940 --> 01:46:09.940
Walk in.

01:46:09.940 --> 01:46:11.940
Everyone go in the crack.

01:46:11.940 --> 01:46:13.940
Everyone go in the crack.

01:46:13.940 --> 01:46:15.940
I walk in the crack, but I have the ropes.

01:46:15.940 --> 01:46:17.940
I do make a plan.

01:46:17.940 --> 01:46:19.940
I walk in the crack.

01:46:19.940 --> 01:46:21.940
I'm not going to fucking...

01:46:21.940 --> 01:46:23.940
As a barbarian.

01:46:23.940 --> 01:46:25.940
As a barbarian.

01:46:25.940 --> 01:46:29.940
I don't like that there's just dragons laying around doing nothing.

01:46:29.940 --> 01:46:32.940
I'm going to kill a dragon for no reason.

01:46:32.940 --> 01:46:34.940
Because you know what?

01:46:34.940 --> 01:46:37.940
We have become chaotic neutral, right?

01:46:37.940 --> 01:46:39.940
At least.

01:46:39.940 --> 01:46:41.940
At the very least.

01:46:41.940 --> 01:46:43.940
We're chaotic.

01:46:43.940 --> 01:46:46.940
Erin, Mulraine, go talk to the dragon.

01:46:46.940 --> 01:46:51.940
Do this Sesame Street level con game on him.

01:46:51.940 --> 01:46:53.940
All right.

01:46:53.940 --> 01:46:55.940
Where you literally said...

01:46:55.940 --> 01:46:57.940
Sesame Street, because at least it's something.

01:46:57.940 --> 01:47:00.940
I go in there with Chris de Burgh.

01:47:00.940 --> 01:47:04.940
As a gnome where I can kind of fit through the crack.

01:47:04.940 --> 01:47:06.940
And he's small enough to fit through the right Spencer.

01:47:06.940 --> 01:47:09.940
Yeah, but I thought he wanted to get out of here.

01:47:09.940 --> 01:47:11.940
I say Chris de Burgh, we go in there.

01:47:11.940 --> 01:47:14.940
Because I've never met a dragon

01:47:14.940 --> 01:47:17.940
that didn't sit on some sort of fucking crazy treasure.

01:47:17.940 --> 01:47:19.940
And I'm easily swayed.

01:47:19.940 --> 01:47:20.940
What?

01:47:20.940 --> 01:47:21.940
Let's go.

01:47:21.940 --> 01:47:22.940
All right.

01:47:22.940 --> 01:47:23.940
Oh, she's in.

01:47:23.940 --> 01:47:24.940
Yeah.

01:47:24.940 --> 01:47:27.940
Part of Bioinformatics is adaptation.

01:47:29.940 --> 01:47:31.940
Wait, you're Chris de Burgh.

01:47:31.940 --> 01:47:32.940
Yeah.

01:47:32.940 --> 01:47:33.940
You're Tylenol.

01:47:33.940 --> 01:47:34.940
Okay, Chris de Burgh.

01:47:34.940 --> 01:47:36.940
And I'm too big to fit through the crack.

01:47:36.940 --> 01:47:38.940
You can fit through the crack.

01:47:38.940 --> 01:47:40.940
I don't know where you got this.

01:47:40.940 --> 01:47:42.940
Hey, Sharpey.

01:47:42.940 --> 01:47:45.940
Hey, you can fit through the crack.

01:47:45.940 --> 01:47:46.940
I'm coming.

01:47:46.940 --> 01:47:48.940
I'm going to make a prediction.

01:47:48.940 --> 01:47:49.940
Metagaming.

01:47:49.940 --> 01:47:52.940
Spencer's wanted to kill us for three months.

01:47:55.940 --> 01:47:58.940
And we are walking into a six-foot hole

01:47:58.940 --> 01:48:01.940
and handing him a shovel.

01:48:01.940 --> 01:48:04.940
Because he's ready to move on.

01:48:04.940 --> 01:48:06.940
You've missed all the cracks before.

01:48:06.940 --> 01:48:08.940
You just don't look in the mirror.

01:48:08.940 --> 01:48:10.940
I run inside.

01:48:10.940 --> 01:48:13.940
Are you saying all the fucking things that we've destroyed,

01:48:13.940 --> 01:48:19.940
all the travails that we've traversed,

01:48:19.940 --> 01:48:23.940
that we can't kill one sleeping dragon?

01:48:23.940 --> 01:48:24.940
I'm scared.

01:48:24.940 --> 01:48:25.940
Half asleep.

01:48:25.940 --> 01:48:26.940
Scared of the black one.

01:48:26.940 --> 01:48:29.940
So more rain runs in, right?

01:48:29.940 --> 01:48:32.940
I run in and I have big blood spatter on me

01:48:32.940 --> 01:48:34.940
and the ropes and everything.

01:48:34.940 --> 01:48:40.940
But we're all just hanging back.

01:48:40.940 --> 01:48:43.940
Describe the chamber, Spencer, that the dragon lives in.

01:48:43.940 --> 01:48:47.940
It looks like a cave, roughly a kidney bean shaped

01:48:47.940 --> 01:48:48.940
in four plan.

01:48:48.940 --> 01:48:49.940
Kidney bean shaped.

01:48:49.940 --> 01:48:52.940
Of course, the geography of a cave

01:48:52.940 --> 01:48:55.940
makes its ceiling and walls be all weird shaped.

01:48:55.940 --> 01:48:57.940
Where is the dragon in the bean?

01:48:57.940 --> 01:49:03.940
It's in right in the bean's middle section.

01:49:03.940 --> 01:49:07.940
That's not the best.

01:49:07.940 --> 01:49:10.940
This is my favorite part of every...

01:49:10.940 --> 01:49:13.940
Let's all agree that while Mulraine does this,

01:49:13.940 --> 01:49:16.940
we all are very near the exits.

01:49:16.940 --> 01:49:19.940
Or very near the popcorn machine.

01:49:19.940 --> 01:49:21.940
I'm just eating popcorn and watching.

01:49:21.940 --> 01:49:23.940
I'll show you.

01:49:23.940 --> 01:49:25.940
So, yeah, you make those noises.

01:49:25.940 --> 01:49:27.940
It's still seemingly asleep.

01:49:27.940 --> 01:49:29.940
It's not really registering you right now.

01:49:29.940 --> 01:49:31.940
I lock up and I eat.

01:49:31.940 --> 01:49:35.940
I get closer to the exit.

01:49:35.940 --> 01:49:40.940
He's asleep, so I poke around the room.

01:49:40.940 --> 01:49:41.940
All right.

01:49:41.940 --> 01:49:42.940
Yeah.

01:49:42.940 --> 01:49:43.940
Should I find anything?

01:49:43.940 --> 01:49:44.940
There's really nothing else

01:49:44.940 --> 01:49:47.940
than this dragon sitting on the stone platform.

01:49:47.940 --> 01:49:50.940
Is poking around a full move action?

01:49:50.940 --> 01:49:51.940
Sure.

01:49:51.940 --> 01:49:55.940
I make a gasp.

01:49:55.940 --> 01:49:56.940
You gasp?

01:49:56.940 --> 01:49:59.940
And I flop myself down in front of the black dragon.

01:49:59.940 --> 01:50:01.940
She's trying to wake up this dragon.

01:50:01.940 --> 01:50:06.940
The dragon stirs and slowly its long serpentine head

01:50:06.940 --> 01:50:10.940
lifts up off of its place on its front paws.

01:50:10.940 --> 01:50:15.940
I get all the way into the exit.

01:50:15.940 --> 01:50:19.940
I'm basically leaving.

01:50:19.940 --> 01:50:22.940
Hey, so glad you're awake.

01:50:22.940 --> 01:50:26.940
Jesus Christ.

01:50:26.940 --> 01:50:29.940
It continues to stir and it starts to look at you

01:50:29.940 --> 01:50:31.940
like half waking up, you know?

01:50:31.940 --> 01:50:32.940
Okay.

01:50:32.940 --> 01:50:35.940
Hello.

01:50:35.940 --> 01:50:36.940
Wow.

01:50:36.940 --> 01:50:39.940
Glad you're awake.

01:50:39.940 --> 01:50:43.940
This has been a long journey for me.

01:50:43.940 --> 01:50:45.940
From point A to point B.

01:50:45.940 --> 01:50:47.940
Point A being that I learned that you are the dragon

01:50:47.940 --> 01:50:51.940
that's the best dragon who has the best ideas about everything.

01:50:51.940 --> 01:50:53.940
And point B being finally meeting you

01:50:53.940 --> 01:50:58.940
because there is a town that is coming for you

01:50:58.940 --> 01:50:59.940
and I am here to protect you.

01:50:59.940 --> 01:51:01.940
They tied me up.

01:51:01.940 --> 01:51:04.940
They cut me and don't look for the cuts,

01:51:04.940 --> 01:51:09.940
but there was blood.

01:51:09.940 --> 01:51:12.940
I threw up a lot of blood and they took that blood

01:51:12.940 --> 01:51:13.940
and they spat it.

01:51:13.940 --> 01:51:14.940
This is gross.

01:51:14.940 --> 01:51:15.940
You don't want to hear this.

01:51:15.940 --> 01:51:21.940
But what is happening?

01:51:21.940 --> 01:51:24.940
It opens and closes its mouth a couple of times,

01:51:24.940 --> 01:51:26.940
revealing its razor sharp jaws

01:51:26.940 --> 01:51:31.940
and you can see acid starting to bubble up in its mouth hole.

01:51:31.940 --> 01:51:32.940
I leave.

01:51:32.940 --> 01:51:33.940
Well, no, wait.

01:51:33.940 --> 01:51:35.940
That happens to me when I sleep too.

01:51:35.940 --> 01:51:37.940
I actually...

01:51:37.940 --> 01:51:39.940
That could be nothing.

01:51:39.940 --> 01:51:40.940
Exactly.

01:51:40.940 --> 01:51:44.940
I would get mad too hearing about this town.

01:51:44.940 --> 01:51:48.940
I mean, my mouth is foaming thinking about this.

01:51:48.940 --> 01:51:52.940
But I guess I'll get on your back and I'll ride you to victory.

01:51:52.940 --> 01:51:55.940
How do we make this work?

01:51:55.940 --> 01:51:57.940
Or wear your diamonds?

01:51:57.940 --> 01:52:00.940
What's your story?

01:52:00.940 --> 01:52:03.940
I'm all the way outside the fucking cave.

01:52:03.940 --> 01:52:06.940
The dragon roars ferociously so loud

01:52:06.940 --> 01:52:09.940
that your ears are ringing and hurt

01:52:09.940 --> 01:52:14.940
and you feel bad about hearing that noise.

01:52:14.940 --> 01:52:15.940
So loud is it?

01:52:15.940 --> 01:52:19.940
So let's just talk differently.

01:52:19.940 --> 01:52:22.940
If we can communicate differently.

01:52:22.940 --> 01:52:26.940
Are we cool?

01:52:26.940 --> 01:52:30.940
It just continues to look at you after...

01:52:30.940 --> 01:52:31.940
What was it?

01:52:31.940 --> 01:52:32.940
Roaring?

01:52:32.940 --> 01:52:33.940
It did, right?

01:52:33.940 --> 01:52:35.940
After roaring and you see,

01:52:35.940 --> 01:52:39.940
maybe where the tonsils would be on its throat,

01:52:39.940 --> 01:52:44.940
they start to bulge up like maybe like a toad's sack.

01:52:44.940 --> 01:52:47.940
So I run out through the crack.

01:52:47.940 --> 01:52:49.940
What the fuck?

01:52:49.940 --> 01:52:51.940
Let's get out of here!

01:52:51.940 --> 01:52:52.940
Me first!

01:52:52.940 --> 01:52:53.940
Let's get out of here!

01:52:53.940 --> 01:52:55.940
Everybody on my back.

01:52:55.940 --> 01:52:58.940
Everybody on my back.

01:52:58.940 --> 01:53:02.940
You fucking asshole!

01:53:02.940 --> 01:53:06.940
I'm riding everybody out of there while this argument's going on.

01:53:06.940 --> 01:53:08.940
Sorry guys, I...

01:53:08.940 --> 01:53:11.940
You know, we all messed up sometimes.

01:53:11.940 --> 01:53:16.940
Yeah, but sometimes everyone's telling you don't misstep.

01:53:16.940 --> 01:53:18.940
And then you're like, no, for real.

01:53:18.940 --> 01:53:20.940
Someone has to go in there.

01:53:20.940 --> 01:53:22.940
Although everybody wanted to go in that fucking crack.

01:53:22.940 --> 01:53:24.940
I wanted to sneak in there.

01:53:24.940 --> 01:53:26.940
I didn't want to go wake him up.

01:53:26.940 --> 01:53:28.940
I didn't want to go...

01:53:28.940 --> 01:53:33.940
Come on, you all wanted your crack and you all got it.

01:53:33.940 --> 01:53:36.940
I alone wanted to run first.

01:53:36.940 --> 01:53:38.940
It would have saved us 20 minutes of game time.

01:53:38.940 --> 01:53:41.940
I would have gone on there with Chris de Burgh and we would have gone in there

01:53:41.940 --> 01:53:44.940
and while he was asleep we would have sneaked in there and tried to rob him.

01:53:44.940 --> 01:53:46.940
Like burglars.

01:53:46.940 --> 01:53:50.940
To the baby village!

01:53:50.940 --> 01:53:55.940
So you ride out of these purple caverns and you can't really see for a moment the light.

01:53:55.940 --> 01:54:00.940
It's blinding you, but the first thing you see in the sky is a large black shape.

01:54:00.940 --> 01:54:03.940
It's floating towards you.

01:54:03.940 --> 01:54:05.940
He's pulling us over.

01:54:05.940 --> 01:54:08.940
Oh, no.

01:54:08.940 --> 01:54:10.940
Yeah, sure.

01:54:10.940 --> 01:54:12.940
What is the shape that I mentioned?

01:54:12.940 --> 01:54:14.940
I'm not sure.

01:54:14.940 --> 01:54:16.940
It's black and silver.

01:54:16.940 --> 01:54:19.940
It looks like a zeppelin.

01:54:19.940 --> 01:54:22.940
You see the markings on the zeppelin.

01:54:22.940 --> 01:54:25.940
It seems to be the markings of Admiral Darkstar.

01:54:25.940 --> 01:54:29.940
The zeppelin is heading directly towards you incredibly quickly.

01:54:29.940 --> 01:54:33.940
It appears to be on a crash course with your direct location.

01:54:33.940 --> 01:54:36.940
Well, Tylenol, evasive...

01:54:36.940 --> 01:54:38.940
Can I take evasive action?

01:54:38.940 --> 01:54:41.940
You take evasive action!

01:54:41.940 --> 01:54:44.940
You do so with such grace and alacrity!

01:54:44.940 --> 01:54:47.940
Or maybe not.

01:54:47.940 --> 01:54:50.940
With such grace and alacrity!

01:54:50.940 --> 01:54:55.940
Right as the zeppelin goes crashing into the purple wall of the purple canyon

01:54:55.940 --> 01:54:59.940
and it explodes in a great fireball you dodge out of the way

01:54:59.940 --> 01:55:03.940
and a crumple hole falls to the ground with a clunk.

01:55:03.940 --> 01:55:09.940
And you see three flaming goblins screaming and running out of the hole of this ship.

01:55:09.940 --> 01:55:11.940
Away from us the tortoise.

01:55:11.940 --> 01:55:13.940
And they're goblins. There's three of them.

01:55:13.940 --> 01:55:17.940
They're stop-dropping and rolling to try and put out the fire on their bodies,

01:55:17.940 --> 01:55:20.940
but it's not extinguishing.

01:55:20.940 --> 01:55:22.940
They were just going to ram us with a zeppelin?

01:55:22.940 --> 01:55:24.940
Who knows, man.

01:55:24.940 --> 01:55:27.940
Mulraine, take some arrows and shoot those guys down.

01:55:27.940 --> 01:55:29.940
I draw two arrows.

01:55:29.940 --> 01:55:30.940
Yes.

01:55:30.940 --> 01:55:32.940
And I... at the drone?

01:55:32.940 --> 01:55:33.940
At the goblins.

01:55:33.940 --> 01:55:35.940
At the goblins. Oh, but they're hurt already.

01:55:35.940 --> 01:55:38.940
But they're just like the people in the Hindenburg.

01:55:38.940 --> 01:55:39.940
Kill them.

01:55:39.940 --> 01:55:41.940
You know, I don't think I'm...

01:55:41.940 --> 01:55:45.940
They're goblins on Admiral Darkstar's ship. They're not here to help.

01:55:45.940 --> 01:55:46.940
They're dying.

01:55:46.940 --> 01:55:48.940
I don't think I'm chaotic.

01:55:48.940 --> 01:55:51.940
I'm not chaotic good anymore. I take out my cutlass

01:55:51.940 --> 01:55:55.940
and I start running towards them.

01:55:55.940 --> 01:55:58.940
Running? We're on a flying fucking...

01:55:58.940 --> 01:55:59.940
He doesn't fly.

01:55:59.940 --> 01:56:01.940
He doesn't fly. He doesn't fly.

01:56:01.940 --> 01:56:02.940
He's not a pegasus.

01:56:02.940 --> 01:56:03.940
I jump off of him.

01:56:03.940 --> 01:56:07.940
Can I activate my circle of... my circle against Evil?

01:56:07.940 --> 01:56:08.940
Sure, that happens.

01:56:08.940 --> 01:56:10.940
But you're standing still, right?

01:56:10.940 --> 01:56:11.940
Now?

01:56:11.940 --> 01:56:12.940
Oh, she's off me now?

01:56:12.940 --> 01:56:14.940
Well, she was running towards it with the cost, I think.

01:56:14.940 --> 01:56:16.940
Well, I'm safe.

01:56:16.940 --> 01:56:18.940
Okay.

01:56:18.940 --> 01:56:19.940
Yeah, you are safe.

01:56:19.940 --> 01:56:20.940
How long can I run alongside her?

01:56:20.940 --> 01:56:22.940
I don't think I can jump back on her.

01:56:22.940 --> 01:56:24.940
All right. You're on him.

01:56:24.940 --> 01:56:26.940
And now I'm riding toward the goblins,

01:56:26.940 --> 01:56:29.940
having activated the circle against Evil.

01:56:29.940 --> 01:56:30.940
All right.

01:56:30.940 --> 01:56:31.940
This happens.

01:56:31.940 --> 01:56:33.940
You approach the goblins with your circle,

01:56:33.940 --> 01:56:35.940
and your circle engulfs the goblins,

01:56:35.940 --> 01:56:38.940
and the goblins are not bothered somehow,

01:56:38.940 --> 01:56:41.940
yet still their flesh burns.

01:56:41.940 --> 01:56:43.940
Can I use multi-attack on them?

01:56:43.940 --> 01:56:46.940
Sure, you know.

01:56:46.940 --> 01:56:47.940
Let's do it.

01:56:47.940 --> 01:56:49.940
So I use multi-attack on them.

01:56:49.940 --> 01:56:53.940
You stab one directly in the eye with your forehead.

01:56:53.940 --> 01:56:56.940
I mean, the horn on them.

01:56:56.940 --> 01:57:00.940
I use my whisper bow to shoot out the other one.

01:57:00.940 --> 01:57:01.940
All right.

01:57:01.940 --> 01:57:03.940
What are we doing?

01:57:03.940 --> 01:57:07.940
It's like we're the G.E.A. outside of Waco,

01:57:07.940 --> 01:57:12.940
like just picking off fucking fleeing Davidians.

01:57:12.940 --> 01:57:13.940
What are we doing?

01:57:13.940 --> 01:57:15.940
Let's just get out of here.

01:57:15.940 --> 01:57:19.940
Well, they tried to ram us with a zeppelin that they missed.

01:57:19.940 --> 01:57:24.940
Well, yeah, the karma has been wrought on them.

01:57:24.940 --> 01:57:27.940
With the multi-attack, you stab the guy in the eye,

01:57:27.940 --> 01:57:28.940
and he dies.

01:57:28.940 --> 01:57:30.940
The other guy, you stomp on his head with your hoof,

01:57:30.940 --> 01:57:31.940
and his head pops.

01:57:31.940 --> 01:57:32.940
Jesus.

01:57:32.940 --> 01:57:34.940
God almighty.

01:57:34.940 --> 01:57:37.940
There's one flaming goblin remaining.

01:57:37.940 --> 01:57:41.940
Okay, I go up, I run to the last flaming goblin,

01:57:41.940 --> 01:57:43.940
I take my water skin out, and I douse him,

01:57:43.940 --> 01:57:46.940
and try to save him, just to ask him some questions.

01:57:46.940 --> 01:57:49.940
You douse him in the water, and his fire goes out,

01:57:49.940 --> 01:57:52.940
but then it comes back, and he's on fire again.

01:57:52.940 --> 01:57:54.940
I piss on him.

01:57:54.940 --> 01:57:55.940
All right.

01:57:55.940 --> 01:57:58.940
It extinguishes the fire, and then it comes back.

01:57:58.940 --> 01:58:01.940
I blow him out like a birthday candle.

01:58:01.940 --> 01:58:04.940
Nothing happens that time, but I'm doing all this.

01:58:04.940 --> 01:58:07.940
He stops rolling on the ground, and he sits up,

01:58:07.940 --> 01:58:08.940
and he's like, what?

01:58:08.940 --> 01:58:12.940
I guess I'm okay, but I'm on fire.

01:58:12.940 --> 01:58:14.940
Scorching, no, I'm sorry,

01:58:14.940 --> 01:58:17.940
it's a spray of frost to see if it puts out the fire.

01:58:17.940 --> 01:58:19.940
It burns, he's like, ah, ah, ah.

01:58:19.940 --> 01:58:20.940
Yeah, I know, but...

01:58:20.940 --> 01:58:22.940
You're not on fire anymore.

01:58:22.940 --> 01:58:23.940
I still am, though.

01:58:23.940 --> 01:58:25.940
He likes being on fire, he's okay being on fire.

01:58:25.940 --> 01:58:27.940
You like being on fire?

01:58:27.940 --> 01:58:32.940
I mean, I don't like it, but it's, I guess, fine.

01:58:32.940 --> 01:58:33.940
I'm not dead.

01:58:33.940 --> 01:58:34.940
He's okay.

01:58:34.940 --> 01:58:35.940
We're asking questions.

01:58:35.940 --> 01:58:36.940
We've never gone this long.

01:58:36.940 --> 01:58:38.940
We gotta figure out a way to...

01:58:38.940 --> 01:58:41.940
I tried to, I wanted to kill everybody.

01:58:41.940 --> 01:58:43.940
I wanted to fight a dragon.

01:58:43.940 --> 01:58:45.940
I want to placate every goblin and dragon you ever met.

01:58:45.940 --> 01:58:47.940
I wanted to leave.

01:58:47.940 --> 01:58:51.940
I wanted to leave, and it's been recorded.

01:58:51.940 --> 01:58:56.940
Then talk to this goblin who almost tried to kill us,

01:58:56.940 --> 01:58:59.940
or at least was a passenger on a sepulon.

01:58:59.940 --> 01:59:02.940
He's on fire, doesn't hate it.

01:59:02.940 --> 01:59:03.940
We can't put it on.

01:59:03.940 --> 01:59:05.940
Yeah, putting him out doesn't work.

01:59:05.940 --> 01:59:07.940
Can I stuff him in the bag of holding?

01:59:07.940 --> 01:59:08.940
Yep.

01:59:08.940 --> 01:59:11.940
I stuff him in the bag of holding.

01:59:11.940 --> 01:59:13.940
And I go, like, there's a lot of shit in there.

01:59:13.940 --> 01:59:15.940
Like, a lot of it might be worth something,

01:59:15.940 --> 01:59:19.940
but you're gonna get waterboarded later.

01:59:19.940 --> 01:59:23.940
Enhanced, interrogated.

01:59:23.940 --> 01:59:26.940
Is there anything else on the sepulon that survives?

01:59:26.940 --> 01:59:29.940
I mean, it's about 20 feet off.

01:59:29.940 --> 01:59:30.940
I go to the sepulon.

01:59:30.940 --> 01:59:33.940
You go to the sepulon.

01:59:33.940 --> 01:59:35.940
You see a flaming sack.

01:59:35.940 --> 01:59:41.940
Yeah.

01:59:41.940 --> 01:59:43.940
I look, I examine the flaming sack.

01:59:43.940 --> 01:59:45.940
It burns, it burns apart before you,

01:59:45.940 --> 01:59:49.940
and you see small cloth and wooden goods being consumed,

01:59:49.940 --> 01:59:53.940
but among them you see untarnished by the flames,

01:59:53.940 --> 01:59:56.940
a crystalline disk of sorts.

01:59:56.940 --> 01:59:59.940
Oh, I grabbed that disk, and I put it in the robot baby.

01:59:59.940 --> 02:00:00.940
You do that.

02:00:00.940 --> 02:00:01.940
What?

02:00:01.940 --> 02:00:02.940
The robot baby.

02:00:02.940 --> 02:00:04.940
Any round I'm holding?

02:00:04.940 --> 02:00:07.940
It makes a crazy noise and starts vibrating,

02:00:07.940 --> 02:00:09.940
and then it goes, unit active.

02:00:09.940 --> 02:00:11.940
Diagnostic complete.

02:00:11.940 --> 02:00:13.940
Baby Phyllis!

02:00:13.940 --> 02:00:16.940
Hey, hey, hey!

02:00:16.940 --> 02:00:21.940
Baby Phyllis!

02:00:21.940 --> 02:00:23.940
We fucking did it.

02:00:23.940 --> 02:00:27.940
DeMarce Brown, everybody.

02:00:27.940 --> 02:00:29.940
Morgan, what's your last name?

02:00:29.940 --> 02:00:30.940
Carol?

02:00:30.940 --> 02:00:32.940
Harold.

02:00:32.940 --> 02:00:34.940
Morgan Harold?

02:00:34.940 --> 02:00:36.940
Colsonette, Morgan Harold, everybody.

02:00:36.940 --> 02:00:40.940
Erin McGathy, Spencer Crittenden, and I'm Jeff Davis.

02:00:40.940 --> 02:00:44.940
Your mayor is Dan Harmon, as always.

02:00:44.940 --> 02:00:48.940
I feel like next week's D&D is going to be something fucking spectacular

02:00:48.940 --> 02:00:54.940
because we activated a robot baby.

02:00:54.940 --> 02:00:58.940
Sorry if you have work in the morning, sorry.

02:00:58.940 --> 02:01:03.940
It's your third breakfast.
