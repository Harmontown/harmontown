great\n\n04:35.840 --> 04:41.280\ntime in New York but a self-destructive one, I mean I really alarmed myself and Cody.\n\n04:41.280 --> 04:43.280\nWhat were you doing in New York?\n\n04:43.280 --> 04:53.240\nI was just drinking, I was also, I was premiering, I was attending the premiere of a movie I\n\n04:53.240 --> 04:59.720\nwas in, the title of which is Very Long and starts with the word Seven Stages, I think\n\n04:59.720 --> 05:07.920\nif you google Seven Stages, Harmon or Holy Storch which is played by Taika Waititi, Kate\n\n05:07.920 --> 05:13.120\nMcCuchy's in it, Sam Huntington, they're amazing, I mean McCuchy, I don't want to play\n\n05:13.120 --> 05:18.840\nfavorites or whatever but it's like she exactly produced the movie and she's just, she's so\n\n05:18.840 --> 05:19.840\nfantastic in it.\n\n05:19.840 --> 05:20.840\nVery genius, yeah.\n\n05:20.840 --> 05:21.840\nVery genius.\n\n05:21.840 --> 05:32.000\nThere's a lot of, there's a lot of really cool alternative, I don't know what you, there's\n\n05:32.000 --> 05:37.000\nvery hip, funny people in it that have much smaller roles than me and I'm incredibly fat\n\n05:37.000 --> 05:41.400\nin it and make me feel great because I felt like I lost weight when I watched it, I was\n\n05:41.400 --> 05:44.600\nlike wow look how fat you are on the screen.\n\n05:44.600 --> 05:48.000\nThe camera adds a lot of self-hate.\n\n05:48.000 --> 05:59.080\nYeah, I mean I was at the, I was in the bathroom in my New York hotel room and I was a night\n\n05:59.080 --> 06:07.360\nof drinking and I had a good time and then I'm like just brushing my teeth and I think\n\n06:07.360 --> 06:13.240\nI believe that this is what I did, I had to tell the staff, I'm sorry I broke a light\n\n06:13.240 --> 06:20.240\nbulb, like a, like the glass ball that covers the bulb but I didn't tell them, I did it\n\n06:20.240 --> 06:25.720\non purpose because that would be insane but I think that's what I did, I was like looking\n\n06:25.720 --> 06:34.040\nat it and then I just reached out and pulled it off and dropped it on the floor of the\n\n06:34.040 --> 06:35.040\nbathroom.\n\n06:35.040 --> 06:36.040\nOkay.\n\n06:36.040 --> 06:40.640\nThat's fucking badass man, that's metal as fuck.\n\n06:40.640 --> 06:45.360\nI mean that's how you know your life is going pretty well, you're just like making up disasters.\n\n06:45.360 --> 06:47.560\nDid it satisfy you?\n\n06:47.560 --> 06:54.320\nNo, I just kind of looked at it and was like huh, what was that, what was that behavior?\n\n06:54.320 --> 06:55.320\nIt was weird.\n\n06:55.320 --> 06:59.160\nI told the lady at the front desk, I'm really sorry, obviously I'm going to pay for it but\n\n06:59.160 --> 07:03.320\nI don't want the staff to get hurt, there's broken glass on the floor and she's like yeah\n\n07:03.320 --> 07:09.000\nyou seem like you're in pretty high spirits and I was like yeah I'm quite drunk.\n\n07:09.000 --> 07:10.000\nSo she deserved it?\n\n07:10.000 --> 07:13.080\nWell, I don't know, she was nice, she was very nice.\n\n07:13.080 --> 07:16.320\nI like that you knew that these people were going to be jerks at this hotel if something\n\n07:16.320 --> 07:17.320\nshould go wrong.\n\n07:17.320 --> 07:22.680\nI just outed, I'm going to prove it's like when an adopted kid sets fire to their foster\n\n07:22.680 --> 07:29.240\nparents living room and then they're like you piece of shit, he's like see.\n\n07:29.240 --> 07:31.320\nWere you in high spirits?\n\n07:31.320 --> 07:32.640\nI was drunk.\n\n07:32.640 --> 07:33.640\nRight.\n\n07:33.640 --> 07:36.640\nYeah, I had a great time, you know who's a great guy that I would really love to hang\n\n07:36.640 --> 07:41.040\nout with here in L.A. and I'm sure I'll come on the show and Mark McKinney, I'd never,\n\n07:41.040 --> 07:45.000\nI think that was the last kid in the hall that I've met.\n\n07:45.000 --> 07:49.800\nYeah, Canadians are good people, they're nice, there's no bravada.\n\n07:49.800 --> 07:56.200\nYeah, he's a very, I risk insulting him by sounding shocked by this but he's just a very\n\n07:56.200 --> 08:05.800\nfunny guy, very witty, charming and friendly and he likes to drink, he's Canadian, they\n\n08:05.800 --> 08:06.800\nlike to drink.\n\n08:06.800 --> 08:11.240\nThey're basically like Milwaukeeans in Canada, you know.\n\n08:11.240 --> 08:12.240\nDoes he live in L.A.?\n\n08:12.240 --> 08:13.680\nIs there a chance that you guys could have a play date?\n\n08:13.680 --> 08:19.920\nYeah, I think he's in Toronto a lot but he is also living here and I think, yeah, I can't\n\n08:19.920 --> 08:24.880\nremember what his exact schedule is but we did exchange digits and I think he'd be a\n\n08:24.880 --> 08:26.120\ngreat guest on the show.\n\n08:26.120 --> 08:27.120\nAwesome.\n\n08:27.120 --> 08:28.120\nWhat else?\n\n08:28.120 --> 08:31.720\nAlso, and then I want to know about the garage, fixed?\n\n08:31.720 --> 08:37.920\nIt's fixed at this point, it just has to be painted, doesn't have an address on it yet.\n\n08:37.920 --> 08:39.800\nThat's not a big deal, I'm not going to let that get to me.\n\n08:39.800 --> 08:40.800\nOkay.\n\n08:40.800 --> 08:46.320\nI don't really need a garage, I don't have a car but it's good that it's fixed, I guess.\n\n08:46.320 --> 08:47.320\nOkay.\n\n08:47.320 --> 08:52.480\nA little less urban blight on my block.\n\n08:52.480 --> 08:58.960\nWhat's with the grit in Bloody Marys, what is that?\n\n08:58.960 --> 09:06.600\nWhy is part of a Bloody Mary just gross little chunky balls of black like fucking shit?\n\n09:06.600 --> 09:08.600\nIt's peppercorns.\n\n09:08.600 --> 09:12.160\nWhat the fuck, you ordered it.\n\n09:12.160 --> 09:18.680\nYou know I was a bartender, so yeah man, you don't want to order the shit with the shit\n\n09:18.680 --> 09:19.680\nin it.\n\n09:19.680 --> 09:25.200\nYeah, well, I just, so can I say when I order a Bloody Mary, can I say can you not with\n\n09:25.200 --> 09:26.200\na peppercorn?\n\n09:26.200 --> 09:27.200\nYes.\n\n09:27.200 --> 09:28.200\nOkay.\n\n09:28.200 --> 09:32.160\nBecause I kind of like every once in a while I'll be in the mood for a Bloody Mary but then\n\n09:32.160 --> 09:37.000\nI remember I'd like have shoots up through the straw, this fucking like shitty little\n\n09:37.000 --> 09:46.400\nbeady of charcoal and then you take out the straw, you try to drink around it, you get\n\n09:46.400 --> 09:51.920\nthe fucking balls of pepper on your mustache, it's fucking gross, what a gross drink, what\n\n09:51.920 --> 09:56.000\na terrible, terrible thing to do to somebody.\n\n09:56.000 --> 09:58.320\nSo Mark, was it hotel or was it out?\n\n09:58.320 --> 09:59.320\nWere you out?\n\n09:59.320 --> 10:04.440\nI had a Bloody Mary at the standard with, I wasn't staying at the standard but I went\n\n10:04.440 --> 10:09.120\nthere to drink and wait for our car to come.\n\n10:09.120 --> 10:10.120\nOkay.\n\n10:10.120 --> 10:12.440\nNot a bad choice.\n\n10:12.440 --> 10:16.720\nBaby boomers are bad people, I wrote that down.\n\n10:16.720 --> 10:21.160\nThey're almost dead but the ones that are left, you know, kind of destroying.\n\n10:21.160 --> 10:22.160\nWhy do you feel like they're bad people?\n\n10:22.160 --> 10:25.640\nIs it because of the events of late or do you feel like they blew it through the 60s\n\n10:25.640 --> 10:26.640\nand 70s?\n\n10:26.640 --> 10:31.800\nI guess the former, they're just not aging very well at all, they're becoming villains\n\n10:31.800 --> 10:36.360\nand I mean maybe the good ones died at like 65.\n\n10:36.360 --> 10:39.400\nThere's also a lot of assassination.\n\n10:39.400 --> 10:45.000\nAnd now we are left with mummies and assassins.\n\n10:45.000 --> 10:50.400\nSo don't take it personal, if you have a baby boomer in your life, maybe they're a ghost\n\n10:50.400 --> 10:55.800\nor an angel, but if they're alive, they're probably a piece of shit, pretty much.\n\n10:55.800 --> 10:57.560\nOr they invented street lights.\n\n10:57.560 --> 10:59.360\nThey invented street lights, that's true.\n\n10:59.360 --> 11:04.160\nThey were the dude that was like, we should use glue for concrete, you know, so we have.\n\n11:04.160 --> 11:08.560\nRemember I see an old person, I'm like, this motherfucker might be the person who invented\n\n11:08.560 --> 11:14.000\nthose bags that hang over you in surgery with the saline in them, right, so I'm like, be\n\n11:14.000 --> 11:15.000\nnice, you know.\n\n11:15.000 --> 11:16.000\nBe nice!\n\n11:16.000 --> 11:19.240\nBecause if they invented it, they might be able to recall them.\n\n11:19.240 --> 11:20.240\nRight.\n\n11:20.240 --> 11:27.400\nThey might be standing at an operating table with a brick hanging over you, with a hose\n\n11:27.400 --> 11:29.400\ncoming down in your arm.\n\n11:29.400 --> 11:33.760\nHow great would it be if old people could recall technology?\n\n11:33.760 --> 11:39.160\nI didn't invent street lights so that all these immigrants could come to my country,\n\n11:39.160 --> 11:41.160\nI'm turning them off!\n\n11:41.160 --> 11:44.800\nI said the music's too loud, now give us back the subwoofer!\n\n11:44.800 --> 11:47.800\nNobody gets the subwoofer!\n\n11:47.800 --> 11:50.480\nYou all have to use two tweeters.\n\n11:50.480 --> 11:51.480\nToo much rap!\n\n11:51.480 --> 11:52.480\nToo much rap!\n\n11:52.480 --> 11:56.360\nI want to hear the Beatles'.\n\n11:56.360 --> 12:03.240\nWell it's kind of interesting, Brandon, you, in singing the praises of our previous generation,\n\n12:03.240 --> 12:07.560\nyou really went to some less likely places than people usually go, I usually go to the\n\n12:07.560 --> 12:13.760\nEd Sullivan Beatles moon thing, and you're talking glue and concrete, that's interesting.\n\n12:13.760 --> 12:17.040\nNo, Spencer, how are you?\n\n12:17.040 --> 12:18.600\nI'm good.\n\n12:18.600 --> 12:19.600\nLook at him.\n\n12:19.600 --> 12:20.600\nWhat's going on?\n\n12:20.600 --> 12:21.600\nYeah, why would you?\n\n12:21.600 --> 12:22.600\nFighting him.\n\n12:22.600 --> 12:23.600\nBut we're fighting.\n\n12:23.600 --> 12:24.600\nWhat are you guys fighting about?\n\n12:24.600 --> 12:30.360\nWe got Blue Apron the other day, and Spencer wouldn't let me make glazed nutsauce with\n\n12:30.360 --> 12:31.520\na reduction bouillabaisse.\n\n12:31.520 --> 12:32.520\nHow is apron?\n\n12:32.520 --> 12:33.520\nGet it?\n\n12:33.520 --> 12:38.920\nIt's a blow job joke.\n\n12:38.920 --> 12:41.320\nI bet Blue Apron's going to love that.\n\n12:41.320 --> 12:43.600\nYeah, I mean, thanks.\n\n12:43.600 --> 12:50.880\nYeah, they hate being talked about, nuts, just nuts, what kind of sauce is what you\n\n12:50.880 --> 12:51.880\nshould be asking?\n\n12:51.880 --> 13:00.600\nIt's a nut sauce, a bouillabaisse reduction.\n\n13:00.600 --> 13:10.440\nIf you're just joining us, I'm in a bad mood, I'm hungover.\n\n13:10.440 --> 13:14.480\nGet through the TSA checkpoint as we all do when we travel.\n\n13:14.480 --> 13:15.480\nYou have to, even.\n\n13:15.480 --> 13:21.960\nI didn't even have a bad time personally, I don't understand why they are upset.\n\n13:21.960 --> 13:23.480\nWhy are they upset?\n\n13:23.480 --> 13:26.720\nWhat in the fuck did they think was going to happen?\n\n13:26.720 --> 13:28.160\nThey don't make a lot of money.\n\n13:28.160 --> 13:29.480\nI don't fucking care.\n\n13:29.480 --> 13:34.600\nI'm sorry, I'm yelling at you, I'm asking you to defend them, but everybody makes not\n\n13:34.600 --> 13:36.680\na lot of money except me.\n\n13:36.680 --> 13:39.960\nYeah, it's great.\n\n13:39.960 --> 13:41.360\nI love it.\n\n13:41.360 --> 13:42.360\nIt's great.\n\n13:42.360 --> 13:48.600\nBig piles of money and you can roll around in it and you can buy food.\n\n13:48.600 --> 13:49.600\nYes.\n\n13:49.600 --> 13:54.320\nBut I was poor once, I was a dishwasher, I didn't make enough money.\n\n13:54.320 --> 13:58.360\nThere were too many dirty dishes, I wished that there were less, I wished that they\n\n13:58.360 --> 14:01.520\nwere cleaner when they came to me, but I was a dishwasher.\n\n14:01.520 --> 14:03.200\nThat's how they feel about you all.\n\n14:03.200 --> 14:04.200\nExactly.\n\n14:04.200 --> 14:05.200\nI wish you were cleaner.\n\n14:05.200 --> 14:09.320\nThere's too many of you, you're all in a bad mood, you're all running late.\n\n14:09.320 --> 14:10.960\nAnd we don't understand.\n\n14:10.960 --> 14:12.880\nAnd they're trying to save your life and you give them shit.\n\n14:12.880 --> 14:14.600\nThey're trying to save our life.\n\n14:14.600 --> 14:15.600\nIt's true.\n\n14:15.600 --> 14:16.600\nThat's how the TSA feels.\n\n14:16.600 --> 14:19.440\nThey're like, we're the janitors.\n\n14:19.440 --> 14:22.320\nThen they should smile.\n\n14:22.320 --> 14:27.800\nIf they think they're saving people's lives, they should, like Superman's, very happy.\n\n14:27.800 --> 14:29.320\nWhat if they wear capes?\n\n14:29.320 --> 14:30.320\nThey could wear capes.\n\n14:30.320 --> 14:31.320\nYeah.\n\n14:31.320 --> 14:33.560\nWell, we should make them, we should let them wear capes.\n\n14:33.560 --> 14:36.200\nNo, we should make them wear capes.\n\n14:36.200 --> 14:38.480\nAnd then make them feel good about that.\n\n14:38.480 --> 14:44.480\nOr maybe they should, like, I just, maybe what happened yesterday is probably going\n\n14:44.480 --> 14:50.120\nto happen today, i.e. a bunch of people who are not always in an airport are going to\n\n14:50.120 --> 14:52.920\ncome to an airport for the first time in a while.\n\n14:52.920 --> 14:58.320\nSome of them from foreign countries, all of them at non-ideal times in their lives, none\n\n14:58.320 --> 15:05.880\nof them having gotten up that morning, uh, eager to pull their shoes off and put their\n\n15:05.880 --> 15:08.640\nbelts in a liquid bag.\n\n15:08.640 --> 15:15.920\nNo one, but they get to be there and be used to it.\n\n15:15.920 --> 15:19.600\nThey get to be native to the place that we hate to be.\n\n15:19.600 --> 15:23.880\nBut what I don't understand is, why are they so cranky?\n\n15:23.880 --> 15:28.760\nI just wish they would be mad at the right people, because there are people that don't\n\n15:28.760 --> 15:33.440\nget their laptops out, and then there are people who don't take their jackets off.\n\n15:33.440 --> 15:36.200\nAnd then those people aren't the ones they get mad at.\n\n15:36.200 --> 15:40.400\nThey're always just like, oh, you have a phone.\n\n15:40.400 --> 15:42.520\nIt's like, yeah, everybody has a fucking phone.\n\n15:42.520 --> 15:43.680\nBut it's like, shut up.\n\n15:43.680 --> 15:48.160\nBut it's like, they're always mad about stupid shit, or they're like mad about, like, I don't\n\n15:48.160 --> 15:50.560\nknow, someone's not hearing them.\n\n15:50.560 --> 15:52.680\nAnd it's like, yeah, I mean, everyone's yelling.\n\n15:52.680 --> 15:53.680\nYeah, no one can hear it.\n\n15:53.680 --> 15:54.680\nHere's a thought.\n\n15:54.680 --> 15:55.680\nOkay.\n\n15:55.680 --> 16:03.400\nIf where you work, this goes beyond the TSA, but this is like, if where you work, is\n\n16:03.400 --> 16:12.040\nthere is a sign that says what everyone's supposed to do, and you find yourself repeatedly\n\n16:12.040 --> 16:20.440\nand exasperatingly pointing at the sign and saying, it's on the sign.\n\n16:20.440 --> 16:26.560\nWhat we call that in the sign business is a nonworking sign.\n\n16:26.560 --> 16:28.200\nThat's called a bad sign.\n\n16:28.200 --> 16:30.520\nIt's not working correctly.\n\n16:30.520 --> 16:37.920\nSo it's not really 40,000 strangers fault that they're not seeing the sign or taking\n\n16:37.920 --> 16:38.920\nit into their hearts.\n\n16:38.920 --> 16:42.680\nSee, it really can't be 40,000 people's fault.\n\n16:42.680 --> 16:47.240\n40,000 people can't really do anything wrong on purpose.\n\n16:47.240 --> 16:48.240\nWhoa.\n\n16:48.240 --> 16:49.240\nHold on.\n\n16:49.240 --> 16:50.240\nLet's hold on.\n\n16:50.240 --> 16:51.240\nYeah.\n\n16:51.240 --> 16:52.240\nLet's back up.\n\n16:52.240 --> 16:53.240\n40,000 strangers.\n\n16:53.240 --> 16:55.240\nLet's emphasize that they're strangers to each other.\n\n16:55.240 --> 16:59.360\nAre they strangers in Germany?\n\n16:59.360 --> 17:02.440\nThere's people showing up for, they're not strangers.\n\n17:02.440 --> 17:06.480\nThey're like in a moose lodge kind of organization, and they're like, let's set fire to this\n\n17:06.480 --> 17:10.800\nchurch or something.\n\n17:10.800 --> 17:11.800\nBut let's say.\n\n17:11.800 --> 17:12.960\nThey hated that church.\n\n17:12.960 --> 17:14.520\nWell, but wait a minute.\n\n17:14.520 --> 17:15.520\nNo, no, don't.\n\n17:15.520 --> 17:17.520\nI want to go back.\n\n17:17.520 --> 17:20.200\nThere is no exception to what I'm saying, because we're saying wrong.\n\n17:20.200 --> 17:23.440\nI'm saying the sign is wrong, because it's not working.\n\n17:23.440 --> 17:28.880\nIf you're at a Nazi rally, and with 40,000 Nazis, and there's a sign that says no cell\n\n17:28.880 --> 17:34.080\nphones, and all the other Nazis are on their cell phone, before you go like, guys, you're\n\n17:34.080 --> 17:40.880\nbeing bad Nazis and point the sign, move the sign, make it the text bigger, change the\n\n17:40.880 --> 17:41.880\ncolor scheme.\n\n17:41.880 --> 17:42.880\nStop being Nazis.\n\n17:42.880 --> 17:43.880\nSay what?\n\n17:43.880 --> 17:44.880\nStop being Nazis.\n\n17:44.880 --> 17:46.480\nDon't worry about your cell phones.\n\n17:46.480 --> 17:47.480\nJust go home.\n\n17:47.480 --> 17:52.080\nYeah, but you're, I mean, that's not, I, yeah, but the, the, sure that too, that would be\n\n17:52.080 --> 17:53.080\ngreat.\n\n17:53.080 --> 17:54.080\nBut yeah.\n\n17:54.080 --> 17:55.080\nWe're talking about signs.\n\n17:55.080 --> 17:56.080\nYeah.\n\n17:56.080 --> 17:57.080\nWe're talking about trying to improve science.\n\n17:57.080 --> 18:02.440\nI mean, don't be a fucking Nazi about my metaphors.\n\n18:02.440 --> 18:05.960\nI think you said a lot of people couldn't be wrong, and I was like, I feel like a lot\n\n18:05.960 --> 18:09.600\nof people are often wrong, but I take your point about bad design.\n\n18:09.600 --> 18:10.600\nSemantics.\n\n18:10.600 --> 18:11.600\nSemantics.\n\n18:11.600 --> 18:12.600\nYeah.\n\n18:12.600 --> 18:13.600\nEveryone is all wrong about everything.\n\n18:13.600 --> 18:14.600\nWe're, we're born monsters.\n\n18:14.600 --> 18:17.440\nWe're terrible monkey people that fucking suck and eat dicks.\n\n18:17.440 --> 18:21.680\nBut what about the, you know, isn't there a tendency of people to ignore signs anyway?\n\n18:21.680 --> 18:29.440\nThat, like, like, I mean, I, I agree, like, I agree that a bad sign is like, can be marked\n\n18:29.440 --> 18:32.200\nby the fact that people don't read it, but at the same time there's like doors that\n\n18:32.200 --> 18:35.480\nsay push and pull, and then people just don't look and stuff like that.\n\n18:35.480 --> 18:36.480\nBad sign.\n\n18:36.480 --> 18:38.760\nWell, I mean, not working, not working.\n\n18:38.760 --> 18:40.520\nThe whole experience is not working.\n\n18:40.520 --> 18:41.520\nYeah.\n\n18:41.520 --> 18:42.520\nYeah.\n\n18:42.520 --> 18:43.520\nAnd the signs part of the whole experience.\n\n18:43.520 --> 18:44.520\nYeah.\n\n18:44.520 --> 18:46.080\nI think whoever put up the sign at a noble effort, but I don't know, however long the\n\n18:46.080 --> 18:49.560\nsign's been up there and however mad you are that people aren't pushing and pulling,\n\n18:49.560 --> 18:52.720\nthat's it, you gotta, it's not, it's really not logical.\n\n18:52.720 --> 18:54.320\nIt's not gonna, it's not gonna work.\n\n18:54.320 --> 18:58.400\nIt's like, the people are a force of nature there when they're moving through a door.\n\n18:58.400 --> 19:03.920\nBut people don't have incentive to read every written information around, you know, we kind\n\n19:03.920 --> 19:04.920\nof like, who cares?\n\n19:04.920 --> 19:05.920\nYeah, they don't.\n\n19:05.920 --> 19:06.920\nThey don't.\n\n19:06.920 --> 19:07.920\nRight.\n\n19:07.920 --> 19:08.920\nSo dumb sign.\n\n19:08.920 --> 19:09.920\nIt's not working.\n\n19:09.920 --> 19:10.920\nIt's not going to work.\n\n19:10.920 --> 19:11.920\nPeople don't work like that.\n\n19:11.920 --> 19:13.920\nThere's no sign that people are gonna read.\n\n19:13.920 --> 19:14.920\nRight.\n\n19:14.920 --> 19:16.920\nParticularly if the experience is the same experience.\n\n19:16.920 --> 19:18.720\nOr if it's telling them to do something.\n\n19:18.720 --> 19:23.880\nYou've got to figure out a new way to make people do stuff you don't want them doing.\n\n19:23.880 --> 19:30.080\nWhat if we get someone to yell the same thing over and over until they want to kill everybody?\n\n19:30.080 --> 19:31.080\nSure.\n\n19:31.080 --> 19:37.120\nOr add a class to their grade schools and wait 20 years for everyone to become better\n\n19:37.120 --> 19:38.600\npushers and pullers of doors.\n\n19:38.600 --> 19:39.600\nI don't know.\n\n19:39.600 --> 19:41.200\nWe should start that right now, I think.\n\n19:41.200 --> 19:45.200\nWell, we ought to, if we, if we're gonna be mad 20 years from now about people not staying\n\n19:45.200 --> 19:52.960\noff the grass, we should, we should, we should give them grass feet, special vitamins that\n\n19:52.960 --> 19:54.480\nmake their feet grass.\n\n19:54.480 --> 19:55.840\nThese pants brought the grump out in you.\n\n19:55.840 --> 19:58.680\nI'm a very angry man in his pajamas.\n\n19:58.680 --> 19:59.680\nYeah.\n\n19:59.680 --> 20:04.280\nI just, I just, why is everyone so dumb?\n\n20:04.280 --> 20:08.800\nWhy is everyone so stupid and mean and ugly?\n\n20:08.800 --> 20:09.800\nIt's a rhetorical question.\n\n20:09.800 --> 20:11.040\nI thought you said you had fun in New York.\n\n20:11.040 --> 20:12.040\nI did.\n\n20:12.040 --> 20:13.040\nI did have fun.\n\n20:13.040 --> 20:14.040\nTell me, what else did you do?\n\n20:14.040 --> 20:15.880\nI, it was mostly, it was a lot of.\n\n20:15.880 --> 20:16.880\nWho'd you go with?\n\n20:16.880 --> 20:17.880\nUh, Dino.\n\n20:17.880 --> 20:18.880\nOh, fuck.\n\n20:18.880 --> 20:19.880\nYeah.\n\n20:19.880 --> 20:24.200\nSo you've got to have some stories.\n\n20:24.200 --> 20:25.200\nI do.\n\n20:25.200 --> 20:30.520\nI mean, that you, you know, yeah, I have to think, let's bring Rob Schrab up while I,\n\n20:30.520 --> 20:32.320\nwhile I can think about that.\n\n20:32.320 --> 20:33.320\nRob Schrab.\n\n20:33.320 --> 20:35.880\nLadies and gentlemen, Rob Schrab.\n\n20:35.880 --> 20:42.320\nBack from his tour in 48 continental states on the Schrab hour, the Schrab tour, Schrab\n\n20:42.320 --> 20:44.440\ntour merchandise will be available after the show.\n\n20:44.440 --> 20:52.840\nRob Schrab coming to the stage, saw his mama's pussy on the page, fade in on mama Schrab's\n\n20:52.840 --> 20:55.760\nvagina got robbed.\n\n20:55.760 --> 21:02.000\nI'm a stick up artist robbing your pussy, put your hands in the air, give me your tushy.\n\n21:02.000 --> 21:04.520\nI'm just trying to feed my family.\n\n21:04.520 --> 21:05.520\nRob your pussy.\n\n21:05.520 --> 21:06.520\nStram, I mean, hello.\n\n21:06.520 --> 21:07.520\nHello, Dan.\n\n21:07.520 --> 21:14.640\nHow was your trip to New York?\n\n21:14.640 --> 21:15.640\nIt was good.\n\n21:15.640 --> 21:20.680\nI broke a light bulb, you know, like, like, like, like, like, like I'm like, uh, like\n\n21:20.680 --> 21:26.920\nI was a rapper, like you were destroying an idea apocalypse now where he smashes the\n\n21:26.920 --> 21:27.920\nmirror.\n\n21:27.920 --> 21:28.920\nYeah.\n\n21:28.920 --> 21:36.680\nBut I think honestly, wasn't that, uh, man, uh, uh, uh, scavenging.\n\n21:36.680 --> 21:39.280\nA rapper, I think, loots a hotel room.\n\n21:39.280 --> 21:42.680\nIt took so long to plan that.\n\n21:42.680 --> 21:48.480\nI spent some sense of it, but I was, I, well, I did that guy that is not, it's not, it's\n\n21:48.480 --> 21:53.560\nnot a joking matter, but it's a happy, happy, it's a happier ending to the story.\n\n21:53.560 --> 21:59.200\nThat guy that saved everybody at the Waffle House, not everybody, um, yeah, but it's always\n\n21:59.200 --> 22:00.200\ncool, right?\n\n22:00.200 --> 22:06.120\nYou know, something funny like the guy because he, he, he, he looted the, the mass shooting\n\n22:06.120 --> 22:09.840\nthing, or he like, uh, he, he's, he's like, like the headline was good Fox news was going\n\n22:09.840 --> 22:13.440\nto say that he stole, he stole a gun and that is the thing.\n\n22:13.440 --> 22:17.200\nIt is kind of funny that yes, he got the gun from the dude and then the cops showed up\n\n22:17.200 --> 22:18.200\nand shot him.\n\n22:18.200 --> 22:19.200\nWait, shut up.\n\n22:19.200 --> 22:23.080\nThe cops shot the fucking hero guy shot the hero guy because they were like, because\n\n22:23.080 --> 22:24.080\nhe was holding a gun.\n\n22:24.080 --> 22:25.080\nOh my God.\n\n22:25.080 --> 22:28.040\nThey were like, they didn't know who was who if they'd heard shots or fired, I had no idea\n\n22:28.040 --> 22:29.040\nthat happened.\n\n22:29.040 --> 22:30.040\nThat is a fucking bummer.\n\n22:30.040 --> 22:32.600\nI'm lying, but this is where we are, America.\n\n22:32.600 --> 22:33.600\nThat's straight up.\n\n22:33.600 --> 22:34.600\nThis is where we are.\n\n22:34.600 --> 22:36.480\nThat's night of the living dead.\n\n22:36.480 --> 22:37.480\nYeah.\n\n22:37.480 --> 22:40.520\nThere aren't, there aren't any, I mean, I don't, I don't know if the police aren't supposed\n\n22:40.520 --> 22:44.840\nto necessarily know this, the guy's holding a gun, but, but, but just, just to make the\n\n22:44.840 --> 22:45.840\nobservation.\n\n22:45.840 --> 22:48.360\nThis is usually a, it's usually a white guy, right?\n\n22:48.360 --> 22:49.360\nRight.\n\n22:49.360 --> 22:50.360\nWhat?\n\n22:50.360 --> 22:51.360\nWhat?\n\n22:51.360 --> 23:00.400\nDid you just start a different podcast at the same time as I was at the same time?\n\n23:00.400 --> 23:05.840\nThe problem, I mean, it illustrates the problem with a gun incident, which is that it's a\n\n23:05.840 --> 23:10.640\nhighly chaotic information or situation in which a lot of information changes at a very\n\n23:10.640 --> 23:12.040\nfast pace.\n\n23:12.040 --> 23:17.840\nAnd even having a gun in a shooting situation can be a liability that gets you killed instead\n\n23:17.840 --> 23:19.040\nof protected.\n\n23:19.040 --> 23:22.960\nSo like, that's just inherent to the beast and like, this is exactly why.\n\n23:22.960 --> 23:28.920\nI mean, say that guy had a gun, say that guy shot the shooter, say he did it before he\n\n23:28.920 --> 23:30.600\ngot any casualties.\n\n23:30.600 --> 23:35.080\nThat guy still might have ended up dead because, you know, he was the guy who had a gun when\n\n23:35.080 --> 23:36.080\nthe cops showed up.\n\n23:36.080 --> 23:37.080\nAnd that's just what happened.\n\n23:37.080 --> 23:42.200\nThe bullet might go through the, the, the potential murderer, the hero's bullet could\n\n23:42.200 --> 23:48.120\ngo through his entire body and hit a baby, especially in a, from an assault rifle.\n\n23:48.120 --> 23:51.200\nOr they could just shoot a baby instead of hitting the perpetrator and then the perpetrator\n\n23:51.200 --> 23:54.080\npops like six shots off and it runs off or, you know, who knows?\n\n23:54.080 --> 23:55.080\nI mean, yeah.\n\n23:55.080 --> 24:01.040\nAlso, also here's the thing about this, everybody needs to have a gun concept, which is, that's\n\n24:01.040 --> 24:02.040\nnot freedom.\n\n24:02.040 --> 24:04.440\nI don't, I don't want to have a gun in public.\n\n24:04.440 --> 24:09.680\nI don't, I, I bear, I, I, I immediately, as soon as I could get rid of my wallet and\n\n24:09.680 --> 24:12.800\nput all my credit cards in my phone case, do you think I want to, I want to stop at\n\n24:12.800 --> 24:18.360\nthe counter before I go out the door and load a 45 or a heavier, it's, it's ridiculous.\n\n24:18.360 --> 24:20.360\nI don't even like carrying a laptop.\n\n24:20.360 --> 24:21.760\nI don't think you want to do that.\n\n24:21.760 --> 24:23.440\nI don't want to have a gun.\n\n24:23.440 --> 24:25.960\nI don't think you want to have a gun outside.\n\n24:25.960 --> 24:29.800\nYou know who might or might not our classic character, MC gun control.\n\n24:29.800 --> 24:30.800\nOh shit.\n\n24:30.800 --> 24:31.800\nOh shit.\n\n24:31.800 --> 24:38.920\nYo, it's me, MC gun control, the character where the joke is that you can't tell if he's\n\n24:38.920 --> 24:49.480\na four or against guns, MC gun awareness, bang, bang, shoot, shoot, bang, a lot of guns out\n\n24:49.480 --> 24:54.440\nthere in a gang or not in a shooter's hands.\n\n24:54.440 --> 25:00.840\nIt's a crazy second amendment land, got the guns, they're dangerous, powerful weapons\n\n25:00.840 --> 25:02.800\nfor all of us.\n\n25:02.800 --> 25:05.800\nMC gun control.\n\n25:05.800 --> 25:08.880\nYou can't tell what side I'm on.\n\n25:08.880 --> 25:10.960\nSo now MC gun control.\n\n25:10.960 --> 25:12.800\nOh, oh, oh, yes.\n\n25:12.800 --> 25:19.440\nIn the past, you have at least said the words gun control a fair amount, which has led to\n\n25:19.440 --> 25:24.080\nthere to be like the perception of some amount of balance where you're talking about gun\n\n25:24.080 --> 25:25.080\ncontrol.\n\n25:25.080 --> 25:29.280\nYeah, my job is to spread awareness, make people aware of gun control.\n\n25:29.280 --> 25:33.360\nBut at this point, you were just like talking about a landscape of guns and things people\n\n25:33.360 --> 25:34.360\ncould do with guns.\n\n25:34.360 --> 25:38.560\nThis is the most lethal nation in the United States of the world.\n\n25:38.560 --> 25:40.600\nBut you weren't even mentioning gun control at all.\n\n25:40.600 --> 25:44.600\nYou're just kind of like, you're almost just promoting guns and the things you could do.\n\n25:44.600 --> 25:46.760\nIt's almost impossible to control guns.\n\n25:46.760 --> 25:48.160\nThey're out of control.\n\n25:48.160 --> 25:50.120\nIt's the awareness.\n\n25:50.120 --> 25:54.160\nGuns are incredible killing machines.\n\n25:54.160 --> 25:55.480\nRight.\n\n25:55.480 --> 25:56.480\nYou keep saying that.\n\n25:56.480 --> 25:57.480\nYeah.\n\n25:57.480 --> 25:58.480\nAnd you keep saying.\n\n25:58.480 --> 26:00.760\nWell, then I've done, I'm glad you're aware.\n\n26:00.760 --> 26:04.080\nYou keep saying anyone who wants to kill should get a gun.\n\n26:04.080 --> 26:09.960\nNo, I did not, I don't, that would be a, that would probably be an accidental breaching\n\n26:09.960 --> 26:15.720\nof the comedic formula because I would, that would be like it's Pat saying that she's\n\n26:15.720 --> 26:16.720\na woman.\n\n26:16.720 --> 26:20.600\nWell, I mean, that's implying that people who want to kill people are good.\n\n26:20.600 --> 26:22.000\nOh, thank you.\n\n26:22.000 --> 26:23.000\nOkay.\n\n26:23.000 --> 26:24.000\nAll right.\n\n26:24.000 --> 26:27.640\nBut anyway, the joke is you can't tell.\n\n26:27.640 --> 26:30.440\nI mean, you did say incredible killing machine.\n\n26:30.440 --> 26:31.440\nYeah.\n\n26:31.440 --> 26:32.440\nYeah.\n\n26:32.440 --> 26:37.920\nI'm, I, it's, it's the word incredible means hard to believe.\n\n26:37.920 --> 26:43.080\nAnd you did say the wounds that guns create were like amazing.\n\n26:43.080 --> 26:45.080\nThey're remarkable.\n\n26:45.080 --> 26:46.080\nRight.\n\n26:46.080 --> 26:47.080\nThey're remarkable.\n\n26:47.080 --> 26:48.080\nThat's what you said.\n\n26:48.080 --> 26:49.080\nI'm sorry.\n\n26:49.080 --> 26:50.080\nThey're not worthy.\n\n26:50.080 --> 26:51.080\nThat's, no, that's more neutral.\n\n26:51.080 --> 26:52.080\nThat's true.\n\n26:52.080 --> 26:53.080\nOkay.\n\n26:53.080 --> 26:54.080\nFunny stuff.\n\n26:54.080 --> 26:55.080\nAll right.\n\n26:55.080 --> 26:56.080\nMoving on.\n\n26:56.080 --> 26:57.080\nWhat T-shirt are you wearing, Spencer?\n\n26:57.080 --> 27:00.720\nOh, just this Chinese murder van T-shirt.\n\n27:00.720 --> 27:02.220\nWhoa.\n\n27:02.220 -->

just a walking T-shirt idea factory.\n\n27:22.440 --> 27:23.440\nWhat, what is that T-shirt?\n\n27:23.440 --> 27:24.440\nI wish someone could explain it.\n\n27:24.440 --> 27:25.440\nSpencer, you want

to be made by teepub thousands?\n\n27:59.440 --> 28:01.440\nI meant more of the segue.\n\n28:01.440 --> 28:02.440\nBut sure.\n\n28:02.440 --> 28:04.440\nThe material should be organic as well.\n\n28:04.440 --> 28:06.440\nAnd how, what are you segwaying to?\n\n28:06.440 --> 28:08.440\nAnd add con��is Strfashioned t-shirts.\n\n28:08.440 --> 28:10.440\nAnd he's a Chinese\n\n28:11.080 -->

28:25.680\nWhat if the what if the aprons vibrated every 40 seconds? What if air B&B offered free me undies for guests?\n\n28:25.680 --> 28:28.960\nDid apron come with you to New York apron?\n\n28:30.760 --> 28:34.080\nGenius didn't didn't you know bring apron along\n\n28:34.080 --> 28:38.560\nApron seems like somebody that would hang out with Dino\n\n28:39.920 --> 28:44.680\nWho is with you and Dino when you guys are traipsing around New York apron, right?\n\n28:45.120 --> 28:47.120\nThere are people that we run into\n\n28:47.560 --> 28:54.040\nBut there's no ever Peter blood. Oh, he showed up for a little cameo. Okay, excellent. Do you know his friend Tom?\n\n28:54.040 --> 28:58.120\nMet us out. I bought you know a tiny cactus at a tiny cactus store\n\n28:59.560 --> 29:02.660\nWe he talked to an old fella on the sidewalk\n\n29:02.660 --> 29:07.060\nAbout something. I don't know what they were talking about. I think they're easy conversation\n\n29:07.060 --> 29:08.580\nIt sounds like a fucked up Jim Croce song\n\n29:08.580 --> 29:12.700\nThey were talking they were talking about God or something or maybe I'm projecting that because the guy had a yamacan\n\n29:12.700 --> 29:14.700\nAnd he was like very he seemed to kind of\n\n29:17.020 --> 29:23.420\nPhilosophical okay, but they might have been talking about fucking blue apron. I don't know I'm sure they were\n\n29:23.860 --> 29:25.860\nWhere they like hey\n\n29:25.860 --> 29:29.940\nI don't have the coffee give me the blue apron\n\n29:30.940 --> 29:32.940\nWhat give you a good honey\n\n29:33.940 --> 29:41.740\nThanks, sorry. Sorry everybody. Sorry the show my favorite thing is in the about blue apron ads in particular in podcasting is that\n\n29:41.740 --> 29:43.740\nit's because when you listen to\n\n29:44.660 --> 29:51.660\nTrue crime podcast a lot. There's there's very often a very like it's as if they're doing a bit like it's like like like\n\n29:52.100 --> 29:54.100\ntalking about a horrible murder\n\n29:54.100 --> 30:01.020\nWhat that's something that happens and then there's like no seam going into like having this food delivered to your house\n\n30:01.020 --> 30:06.100\nThat's kind of funny. That's the best. I love that. It's like when they're like, we're gonna be here all night\n\n30:06.100 --> 30:09.540\nSo I'm in this case. I should probably get some blue apron. Yeah, well or worse\n\n30:09.580 --> 30:16.540\nNo, it's you know, it's more like her mangled body had been eaten by her own cats before officers got to the scene and the odor was\n\n30:16.540 --> 30:22.820\nAttracting the police. I love a court squash and I cook with my kids all the time and when I do\n\n30:22.820 --> 30:24.660\nI\n\n30:24.660 --> 30:26.660\nThat's so I mean it definitely\n\n30:26.820 --> 30:33.020\nWith shows like that it seems like you really could sell products because like you're instilling just utter fear\n\n30:33.020 --> 30:37.300\nOh, yeah, I like the kind of thing that makes you not want to leave. Yeah, I mean when you're not leaving your house\n\n30:37.300 --> 30:40.660\nYou know, you got to have groceries. You know, that's what television is\n\n30:40.780 --> 30:46.420\nTelevision is telling you do not stop watching this television like like, you know, like, you know\n\n30:46.420 --> 30:52.380\nYeah, they go go get a car but but drive it back here and keep watching TV, right? Um, what\n\n30:54.500 --> 30:56.500\nDo you think Rob? I\n\n30:56.900 --> 31:02.100\nThink I find it. I was thinking about this. I find it strange\n\n31:03.060 --> 31:05.140\nThat the theme to fall guy\n\n31:06.740 --> 31:12.180\nWas more concerned with letting me know that Lee majors was heterosexual\n\n31:12.180 --> 31:17.460\nHeterosexual then focused on the stunt work. What's the I just remember he's that\n\n31:18.180 --> 31:22.220\nThat the kind of kissing tail, but I've taught ladies plenty\n\n31:24.020 --> 31:27.620\nI'm just like, yeah, and then you jumped over fire\n\n31:33.660 --> 31:36.940\nOkay, but well I've left six feet over a simmering pussy\n\n31:36.940 --> 31:42.460\nYeah, yeah, I'm not the kind of kissing tail, but I'm\n\n31:43.300 --> 31:45.300\nListen, I'm heterosexual\n\n31:45.540 --> 31:48.580\nStraight as an arrow. I don't hug my male friends at all\n\n31:50.140 --> 31:55.740\nI'm really into pussy. Why does everybody keep asking me if I like it? I\n\n31:56.900 --> 32:02.540\nMean like I mean like really I mean like they lead with that. I'm not the kind of kissing tail\n\n32:02.540 --> 32:07.020\nBut and then he goes into how many women he's I\n\n32:08.140 --> 32:10.620\nFound out Dino told a story. It was really funny\n\n32:12.100 --> 32:19.260\nAbout his dad who's no longer with us. So Lee majors. This will be fine. We're just defining his memory, but but\n\n32:20.380 --> 32:23.580\nThere they were watching was watching a Woody Allen movie and\n\n32:24.660 --> 32:26.660\nAnd his dad was in the room and then\n\n32:26.660 --> 32:34.140\nDid when he Allen had a line about the Greeks inventing homosexuality and Dino's dad got up to\n\n32:34.580 --> 32:36.580\npaused the tape and\n\n32:37.100 --> 32:39.540\nLectured Dino about how that's not true\n\n32:40.140 --> 32:47.820\nThe row the reason that rumor got started is because the Romans made made everyone suck their dicks and then kept the\n\n32:48.180 --> 32:51.580\nReplayed the movie and let us let his son just absorb\n\n32:51.580 --> 32:59.020\nIs that true? Thanks. How we got it. Yeah, it really it really cleans up with Greek history\n\n32:59.020 --> 33:06.060\nDoesn't it like I said, you really cook any shame you went into as a Greek here. You're definitely coming out the other side of that one\n\n33:06.940 --> 33:08.140\nrenewed\n\n33:08.140 --> 33:10.140\nDidn't the Roman steal the Greek\n\n33:11.580 --> 33:12.700\nreligions\n\n33:12.700 --> 33:19.140\nMythologies and stuff didn't they just like turn Zeus into Jupiter. Yeah, maybe that's me. It's the same thing\n\n33:19.140 --> 33:25.660\nYeah, I like that. It's a New York sort of battle. That's still sort of going on like the group between the Greeks and the Romans\n\n33:26.900 --> 33:33.060\nYou know, it's real truth is those fucking Romans. There's fucking Romans did this. Yeah, you forget. Yeah, Romans\n\n33:33.060 --> 33:37.340\nThat's funny to imagine Romans as Italians, which they technically were\n\n33:37.740 --> 33:41.700\nBut but it's just funny to imagine them in those those outfits, but talking like Robert De Niro\n\n33:41.700 --> 33:48.800\nMark McKinney the the they they they were asking people to do\n\n33:49.540 --> 33:55.180\nDe Niro impressions in this deadline interview, you know pimping people to do impressions is like kind of like oh boy\n\n33:55.180 --> 33:58.100\nWhat are we how are we gonna get around this and make it funny?\n\n33:59.540 --> 34:01.540\nMark McKinney's impression of De Niro is\n\n34:02.380 --> 34:04.380\nThey put down that fish\n\n34:04.980 --> 34:07.940\nI kept making them do it. Oh all weekend is very funny\n\n34:07.940 --> 34:12.220\nI like that it's just like a plaintive whiny non-existent line from some weird\n\n34:15.700 --> 34:20.660\nNo matter what actor you were if that were the in your catchphrase when people did impressions of you'd be like\n\n34:20.660 --> 34:26.780\nI'm gonna do something. I'm gonna be a dentist. I don't want to be an actor anymore. Why did I why did I star in that movie?\n\n34:28.700 --> 34:33.700\nWe try to figure out the title of the movie wasn't McKinney said don't talk to me with a fish in your hand I\n\n34:33.700 --> 34:39.460\nGot a big crush on him as you can tell I like I like to hang out with him. He's very charming\n\n34:41.860 --> 34:43.500\nI\n\n34:43.500 --> 34:44.500\nDon't\n\n34:44.500 --> 34:47.700\nIt's not like there's a if you're if you're if you're\n\n34:50.700 --> 34:53.980\nYou know Bruce McCullough and you're listening I\n\n34:54.860 --> 34:58.940\nDidn't I can't remember if I met you, but I didn't dislike you.

They're all pretty sweet. They're all very sweet. They're all really really really smart\n\n35:15.620 --> 35:17.620\nYeah, but I like him the best\n\n35:20.780 --> 35:24.560\nI met a guy I met I think I've met him all I can't now I can't remember if I ever met\n\n35:24.560 --> 35:33.500\nHoly I met I met I met Dave Foley. I've met Scott Thompson. I met Kevin McDonald. It was what didn't you yell at Kevin McDonald out of\n\n35:33.500 --> 35:39.980\nYour car window or did I I know I I was going to yell at David Cross one time before\n\n35:40.500 --> 35:42.500\nWe met him like I\n\n35:45.500 --> 35:52.180\nBefore before we just like moved to Los Angeles and we saw walking down the street and I was I\n\n35:52.180 --> 35:59.060\nSaid I should roll down the window and yell mr. Show at him and I and I didn't I think I told Dan\n\n35:59.060 --> 36:03.380\nI should I was thinking about doing that. I'm glad I didn't because that would have been\n\n36:04.140 --> 36:10.820\nDavid thought that was awesome. He would know now. He would have he would have he would have let you have it\n\n36:11.020 --> 36:14.340\nWell, we were moving in a vehicle, right?\n\n36:14.340 --> 36:17.780\nWell, I wouldn't have not if he did he would have been saying it up my bumper\n\n36:17.780 --> 36:22.740\nCross it's fast though. There's a one that we don't know about cross. He runs really fast\n\n36:25.740 --> 36:28.300\nI met David cross the funny thing is I\n\n36:28.780 --> 36:30.300\nit was like\n\n36:30.300 --> 36:35.820\n4 a.m. It was a godly like the Sun was up because I remember it was broad daylight, but it was like so\n\n36:36.380 --> 36:40.120\nLate it was like there was nobody on the road. I was driving back to\n\n36:40.620 --> 36:46.820\nMy apartment for probably from some God knows like some who knows a naughty party at an apartment\n\n36:46.820 --> 36:49.540\nIf it's 4 a.m. Maybe there was coke involved. I don't know\n\n36:49.540 --> 36:52.580\nI was I was like probably stayed on someone's couch\n\n36:52.580 --> 36:57.700\nso I wasn't too drunk to drive and it was coming home very very wee hours of the morning and\n\n36:58.820 --> 37:05.780\nAnd and at the intersection right over by my house like like it's just this deserted\n\n37:07.140 --> 37:08.380\nsubdivision\n\n37:08.380 --> 37:09.980\nThis car\n\n37:09.980 --> 37:14.700\nIt's coming rolling up to the same stop sign. He's kind of he's kind of rolling the stop sign\n\n37:14.700 --> 37:17.500\nHe got there way earlier than me, but didn't come to a full stop\n\n37:18.620 --> 37:24.420\nWhich was fine. I wasn't it wasn't like the person was doing anything really that wrong. It was just\n\n37:25.380 --> 37:27.100\nbut but it\n\n37:27.100 --> 37:33.660\nthe car was in the middle of the intersection as I approached it and then it was David Cross and\n\n37:34.020 --> 37:36.020\nHe looked at my car\n\n37:36.940 --> 37:38.420\ncoming up to the\n\n37:38.420 --> 37:44.660\nStop sign and he and he took both hands off the wheel of the car and put them both on the on the glass of his\n\n37:44.660 --> 37:51.820\nthe driver's side of his car and did this like insane like oh my god, I'm gonna die like like\n\n37:52.900 --> 37:57.820\nPerformance like like as if my car was barreling towards him and he was screaming in in terror\n\n37:57.820 --> 38:01.780\nAnd then he just kept going it was like that was David Cross\n\n38:01.780 --> 38:09.020\nHilarious he just did a bit for me and this is I've never did he oh he never met him and then I met him eventually\n\n38:09.020 --> 38:15.100\nI think I probably brought that up and and how did he I can't remember because that's like sorry. I'm sorry\n\n38:15.740 --> 38:19.140\nYou're sorry. I'm sorry. I can't remember. It gives that's the next question\n\n38:19.140 --> 38:23.100\nWell, then you do you meet David Cross? Did you ever tell him that story and what did he say that?\n\n38:23.100 --> 38:27.700\nThat's obviously a very frustrating thing to not be able to tell you. It's what everybody wants to know\n\n38:27.700 --> 38:32.420\nYeah, everybody everybody wants to know that we were the end where it goes and then we became good friends\n\n38:32.420 --> 38:36.900\nYeah, it's it's it's it's it's it's really irresponsible of me to not have that information\n\n38:37.180 --> 38:41.340\nDo you think that he was maybe a little do you think he was coming from the same place you were coming from?\n\n38:41.420 --> 38:44.460\nWell, you mean you mean you mean lifestyle wise. I\n\n38:45.580 --> 38:50.740\nProbably I mean maybe more I mean it was just that time of the morning like where where Wells would he be?\n\n38:50.740 --> 38:52.740\nHe's not a milkman\n\n38:52.740 --> 38:54.740\nI\n\n38:56.100 --> 38:58.100\nYeah, anyways\n\n38:58.860 --> 39:06.700\nOh, who's the first famous person? Yeah, remember wasn't it David de Covney that we we were in that David de Covney\n\n39:06.980 --> 39:08.980\nDid we meet David? I've never met\n\n39:12.820 --> 39:17.780\nYeah, you're right it was okay, it sounded like you were correcting me like his real names Michael de Covney\n\n39:17.780 --> 39:20.660\nNo, no, I was confirming or affirming your\n\n39:20.660 --> 39:26.420\nWe were in a sushi restaurant and with our eating like for one of the first times with our our agent\n\n39:27.100 --> 39:29.100\nBlair Belcher at UTA and\n\n39:30.340 --> 39:32.340\nRob\n\n39:32.780 --> 39:36.260\nDavid de Covney is behind you\n\n39:36.780 --> 39:39.340\nand I and I and I and I and I went\n\n39:39.900 --> 39:42.580\nDavid de Covney and turned around and\n\n39:42.580 --> 39:51.260\nAnd a David de Covney who was quite literally right behind me sitting back-to-back with me in a tiny restaurant\n\n39:51.260 --> 39:57.620\nThey're like his chair was touching mine. Therefore. He just he heard his name and I so I turned around to see a\n\n39:58.460 --> 39:59.820\nconfused\n\n39:59.820 --> 40:01.900\nDavid de Covney's nostrils in my face\n\n40:03.260 --> 40:07.660\nAnd then and then I turned back around and focused on anything and our agent Blair\n\n40:07.660 --> 40:13.140\nIt was like she chuckled and said he got a treat him like ghosts. Oh no the worst\n\n40:14.020 --> 40:19.020\nThe worst them so he started banging some ceremonial sticks together\n\n40:19.020 --> 40:32.660\nYeah, yeah, I just shrieked him like that\n\n40:33.300 --> 40:36.820\nWe're supposed to treat mr. De Covney. I'm sorry\n\n40:36.820 --> 40:49.420\nDid you make your did you halfway through that? You're like, I better make this Native American chanting so sloppy that it's not offensive\n\n40:49.420 --> 40:52.900\nYeah, yeah, I'm not gonna go. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, I better go\n\n41:04.180 --> 41:09.980\nI liked that observation the celebrities are like ghosts they they in LA there because there's millions of them\n\n41:10.580 --> 41:12.580\nAnd they dress funny\n\n41:12.580 --> 41:18.980\nThough I here's what I think Rob. I think they're starved for very very casual\n\n41:19.420 --> 41:24.420\nNormal conversation that normal people have when they're you know sharing a bus stop\n\n41:24.700 --> 41:28.740\nBecause people are just like oh, you're the guy from the thing or people are like I'm a big fan\n\n41:28.740 --> 41:35.260\nBut people aren't just all like fucking the Steelers, right or whatever like I feel like they hate because all their inner\n\n41:35.260 --> 41:42.100\nInteractions are just so rarefied and not normal and they must have lived with normal interactions before\n\n41:42.620 --> 41:46.980\nYeah, I think you're doing very more. I think I can answer this as an internet celebrity\n\n41:48.420 --> 41:54.860\nIt's great when people talk to you and I hate it. I love I love the hits. I'm really into the hits\n\n41:54.860 --> 41:56.860\nWe talk a lot about the hits branding\n\n41:56.860 --> 42:04.580\nSo people when you see me feel free to just come up to me randomly and speak about some of my great internet videos\n\n42:06.420 --> 42:11.500\nOh, and you see if you see me tell me about any cool new blue blue apron meals you've had\n\n42:12.060 --> 42:16.900\nWhat's the biggest you fucked up with a celebrity like like I think I think Fred Savage probably I\n\n42:17.340 --> 42:21.380\nFred Savage, but I think I made him hate me in two seconds\n\n42:21.380 --> 42:26.180\nOkay, let's hear. Let's hear this. He was he was\n\n42:27.620 --> 42:29.620\nHe was at a GQ\n\n42:30.980 --> 42:32.980\nGentlemen's quarterly\n\n42:33.100 --> 42:36.500\nIt was like they have GQ has a party where it's like I\n\n42:37.660 --> 42:42.180\nCan't I there's some something in their magazine like the hundred most\n\n42:42.700 --> 42:49.260\nWhat kind of party was it? What kind? What was it? What kind of party? What was what was what was the decorations like?\n\n42:49.260 --> 42:56.100\nWhat were they serving tell the story? It's at a party. I don't need to know you're you the\n\n42:57.180 --> 43:03.180\nWhat's what music were they playing before you story coach was a stupid Rob for relief\n\n43:04.500 --> 43:10.260\nAll right, just complain about someone telling a story. I was out. Why do you hate me so much?\n\n43:10.420 --> 43:12.020\nWhy do you hate me?\n\n43:12.020 --> 43:16.940\nJust cold cold and callous. It's great people to think that I\n\n43:16.940 --> 43:21.820\nWent to the kinds of parties where Fred Savage is just hanging out. It was more of a function\n\n43:21.820 --> 43:26.620\nYou know, I don't know how good and how great this story is because I want to hear how you fucked over Fred Savage\n\n43:26.620 --> 43:32.900\nOh, I just like I was to I was introduced to him and you know, he's a he's a director. He's a TV director and\n\n43:33.620 --> 43:36.180\nIt's a you know, and he's his long since\n\n43:37.100 --> 43:43.580\nBen Fred Savage director producer, you know respected by his friends and colleagues\n\n43:43.580 --> 43:47.420\nYou know not treated like a fucking circus freak\n\n43:48.380 --> 43:50.380\nBecause you happen to be on a TV show\n\n43:51.020 --> 43:57.860\nAnd I'm a fucking idiot from Milwaukee. So I was he was talking about like he said, oh, he should try the\n\n43:58.580 --> 44:03.620\nShrimp I'm making this up. I said like like some some some some small talk like like like the shrimp\n\n44:03.620 --> 44:05.460\nIt's just the shrimp\n\n44:05.460 --> 44:11.780\nAppetizers are really good and I and I said when you when you're eating the shrimp appetizers\n\n44:11.780 --> 44:18.940\nDoes does Daniel Stern say that they're delicious in your head Dan and he he looked at me\n\n44:19.820 --> 44:21.020\nlike\n\n44:21.020 --> 44:23.020\nlike that\n\n44:25.220 --> 44:27.220\nWell, of course you love it, you're not Fred Savage\n\n44:27.700 --> 44:32.980\nHe he didn't like it, but I don't I also don't want to tell the story in a way that makes him sound like he\n\n44:33.300 --> 44:38.460\nWas petty or defensive, you know, I don't think anyway, he looked at me like I farted and was like\n\n44:38.460 --> 44:43.380\nYou know like wooh, it stinks in here, you know, it's like it's like he just looked at me like like like okay\n\n44:43.380 --> 44:45.460\nWell, how do you expect me to you know like he just okay?\n\n44:45.460 --> 44:47.060\nLet me ask you a question\n\n44:47.060 --> 44:55.060\nLet me ask you let me ask you a question because you're famous and you have fans and you've had fans who have not\n\n44:55.940 --> 45:01.860\nHit it out of the park a couple of times in person. I'd really say the majority and\n\n45:01.860 --> 45:08.660\nHave they have they come up to you and said something like oh well any or whatever and and you go\n\n45:08.660 --> 45:15.500\nYeah, or are you every time somebody just reminds you of something you've made your your you're like oh, that's sweet\n\n45:15.500 --> 45:21.300\nThat's cool. I honestly. Yeah, I know they let the latter. I honestly cannot think I have I had one encounter\n\n45:21.300 --> 45:25.700\nI can remember with with a guy that I did not like and\n\n45:25.700 --> 45:32.180\nIt it was a guy. It was at the um around tour doing the Harmontown thing. It was in Somerville\n\n45:32.820 --> 45:34.220\nand\n\n45:34.220 --> 45:37.900\nthe guy turned out to be he was a drunk guy that had wandered in and\n\n45:38.660 --> 45:40.660\nOnly knew that I was\n\n45:41.060 --> 45:47.740\nFamous didn't know who I was. So it was why the conversation was insulting and novice and and and cloying and like all about him and and\n\n45:48.420 --> 45:49.620\nand\n\n45:49.620 --> 45:57.660\nBut but but so that means that literally I've never really had a bad encounter with a Dan Harmon fan\n\n45:57.660 --> 46:03.540\nThat's good. People are pretty straightforward. They they they don't they don't they don't there's no bit to do\n\n46:03.540 --> 46:10.500\nYeah, they they say mr. Harmon or or are you Dan Harmon? And then they and then they they're very flat on the streets ahead\n\n46:10.500 --> 46:13.460\nYou're like, oh, yeah, I certainly wouldn't punish anyone for\n\n46:14.260 --> 46:18.780\nreally anything because I always think like this is something that you can't control and\n\n46:18.780 --> 46:26.460\nThat is gonna be gone one day and you're gonna, you know, you suck it up like like like like even the even even if it's like\n\n46:27.260 --> 46:28.820\nNot that this has ever really happened\n\n46:28.820 --> 46:35.460\nBut even if it's not opportune, you know, like but but it's never an inopportune time to approach me because I'm\n\n46:36.100 --> 46:44.860\nNot as as I hear celebrities sometimes say ever eating or with people, right? I may look like I am but I'm inside\n\n46:44.860 --> 46:47.860\nI'm screaming out. I wonder if anyone recognizes me\n\n46:47.860 --> 46:50.780\nAnd I love hearing the answer is yes, damn, right\n\n46:52.100 --> 46:58.580\nIt's a great byproduct because it makes me feel like I can delay most of the work that I'm doing in therapy by another 10 years\n\n46:58.580 --> 47:04.540\nBecause I I'm not a normal person. I'm not perceived that way. So why would I learn to acquire?\n\n47:04.540 --> 47:13.420\nAnd it's also a good indicator of when it's over with yeah, because when they stop doing that, it's it's over with yeah, right?\n\n47:13.420 --> 47:17.980\nYeah, well, oh, wait, is that oh?\n\n47:18.700 --> 47:20.700\nHe means the career\n\n47:23.140 --> 47:25.140\nWhen are we gonna talk about\n\n47:25.420 --> 47:27.660\nWhat's on the chair? Yeah? Oh my gosh?\n\n47:28.500 --> 47:33.420\nThat's right. I brought that up. Why'd you buy a case for Dan's iPad that you've been borrowed?\n\n47:33.420 --> 47:40.060\nOh, no, no, no, I if you weren't here the other way I gave back Dan's iPad\n\n47:40.060 --> 47:44.260\nLet's run. Oh, I just assumed that was for show. We don't have it and I I\n\n47:45.940 --> 47:47.940\nThis iPad Pro\n\n47:48.260 --> 47:50.260\nWas sent to me\n\n47:50.540 --> 47:57.420\nFrom our own Kevin Day who works on Harmontown and he and he wrote me and he's like hey\n\n47:58.580 --> 48:01.700\nBig fan. I heard you were you're down. I\n\n48:01.700 --> 48:10.900\nHad an extra one of these iPad pros and a pencil and I thought if this little tiny thing\n\n48:12.780 --> 48:18.960\nThat I did could just make you just a little bit happier. Wow, I'm gonna do it. Oh come on do it and I was like\n\n48:19.620 --> 48:24.940\nKevin that I'm touched. Thank you so much for doing that. I mean it's strange\n\n48:24.940 --> 48:33.060\nBut I've I've known this guy maybe a year and a half. Yeah, and yeah, and he lives in he doesn't live in Los\n\n48:33.060 --> 48:35.180\nManila's not like he lives in my neighborhood, right?\n\n48:35.700 --> 48:37.700\nHe mailed it\n\n48:38.260 --> 48:42.780\nSent it out to me. Well, he must have mailed it from like maybe the next state over or something\n\n48:43.260 --> 48:48.180\nHot. Yeah, I mean had you talked about this with him before no, he's just a he just fan\n\n48:48.180 --> 48:54.340\nHe hears me on that that you know, I've been depressed. I've lost my way. I don't know if I can go on anymore\n\n48:54.340 --> 48:56.680\nI would I just you know, just and I\n\n48:57.540 --> 48:59.540\nwe had this\n\n48:59.980 --> 49:03.180\nThing with Dan's I there was a miscommunication\n\n49:03.180 --> 49:07.100\nYeah, there's a miscommunication and and and I I bear the brunt of it\n\n49:07.100 --> 49:10.900\nBut it's it's over with now, but this is a really really nice\n\n49:11.500 --> 49:15.620\nLike byproduct of that and I said, you know, you know, Kevin\n\n49:15.620 --> 49:21.700\nI was like, you know, you know, you're you're a really good friend now and you're you always you've been I've met you\n\n49:21.700 --> 49:24.420\nYou're a nice guy and and I did you know\n\n49:25.260 --> 49:32.260\nYou're a friend and you're not friend. You're not you know responsible for my feelings. You know, it's it's but but thank you for this\n\n49:32.260 --> 49:34.260\nAnd he goes whoa, whoa, whoa\n\n49:34.980 --> 49:38.440\nSchrab, what did you just say? I said you're not responsible for my feelings. Whoa\n\n49:39.060 --> 49:41.060\nThat's not true. Wow. I\n\n49:42.060 --> 49:44.260\nCome on care about your feelings\n\n49:45.140 --> 49:49.820\nTherefore I take responsibility for you feel it and I was that's huge blown away\n\n49:49.820 --> 49:56.140\nIt looks like it looks like a legacy iPad like a series one really really really nice\n\n49:56.140 --> 49:59.500\nI mean, I don't know.

I'm gonna shove Ben Vereen down the stairs for a second\n\n01:13:26.220 --> 01:13:30.140\nHe's gonna think he's gonna break his neck. But when he hits the stairs, I thought the saw\n\n01:13:30.140 --> 01:13:35.020\nI thought the prank was that Ben Vereen thought the stairs were soft and then you swap them out for hard stairs\n\n01:13:35.020 --> 01:13:41.820\nThat's the footage Ben Vereen when somebody said they they're gonna punk you but then when he\n\n01:13:42.300 --> 01:13:46.760\nHe saw after he saw the footage. Who was 10 speed and brown shoe? That was flip Wilson and\n\n01:13:51.420 --> 01:13:56.940\n10 speed and brown shoe Google that shit you fucking millennial cyborgs. Yeah, look it up.

Yeah, well, that's the thing is like well\n\n01:14:20.820 --> 01:14:24.020\nThat's why you can't stop is because we start making balances then\n\n01:14:24.020 --> 01:14:30.460\nOnly that from there I don't give a fuck. Yeah, it's hard. Just don't accept a promise from Jeff Davis. That's what I\n\n01:14:30.940 --> 01:14:32.940\nThat's my my motto\n\n01:14:33.300 --> 01:14:37.860\nHere, that's all it took huge broken promise.

So stop it. No, don't tell me what to say. Okay. Say nothing\n\n01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:47.560\nokay, I\n\n01:15:48.280 --> 01:15:50.280\nGot him\n\n01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:53.280\nAll right, so it wasn't nice\n\n01:15:54.080 --> 01:15:59.880\nAnd it was something that he was upset by presumably so then he followed me and then saw the thing and then he unfollowed me\n\n01:15:59.880 --> 01:16:05.500\nAnd it was like, yeah, you know, it's not as good as a Dan Harmon rap, but I hope someday you'll you'll check it out\n\n01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:11.080\nSo just totally high-roated and then I just and I got caught in the crossfire and I got fucking shade thrown on my\n\n01:16:11.080 --> 01:16:17.920\nEverybody it was a it was a hole.

And so then not super later after I don't know\n\n01:16:27.320 --> 01:16:32.000\nIt was it was a good deal after that, but we've we'd never interacted since I've never seen Hamilton. Whatever\n\n01:16:32.760 --> 01:16:36.400\nwe're doing this live read at the Starburns castle and\n\n01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:38.200\nand\n\n01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:40.520\nSome some some young\n\n01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:43.680\n17 year old punk punk\n\n01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:49.720\nShort hair punk comes comes rolling up to our our back door area knocking on the door\n\n01:16:49.720 --> 01:16:56.480\nAnd so I open it up and I I see this young punk and I'm like, oh, hey, are you at the show?\n\n01:16:56.840 --> 01:16:59.680\nYou know because I'm not gonna just be all like, you know\n\n01:16:59.680 --> 01:17:06.240\nMembers only because I'm a nice guy, but still the mood was you don't belong here\n\n01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:09.000\nYou know, even though I was cordial about it and he had a friend with him\n\n01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:13.480\nAnd so it's like are these kids think this is the back door or whatever and you know, it turns out Lynn ran\n\n01:17:13.480 --> 01:17:16.000\nNo, well, Randy doesn't have a ponytail anymore\n\n01:17:17.640 --> 01:17:22.120\nAnd so it's like yeah, and I was like, oh and then and so he's like, yeah, yeah\n\n01:17:22.120 --> 01:17:23.400\nAnd I was like, oh, what's your name?\n\n01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:29.560\nAnd he was like Lynn and so Lynn is a fucking the name any Dan Harmon fan would have just a normal fucking\n\n01:17:29.560 --> 01:17:36.120\nWeird weirdo name and I'm like, oh Lynn and then so I kind of slowly and awkwardly back up to let him in\n\n01:17:36.120 --> 01:17:42.880\nAnd then he's with his friend and then and then he can tell that I haven't like I'm still like my guards up\n\n01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:44.280\nOr like I don't know what's happening\n\n01:17:44.280 --> 01:17:50.360\nI see he he can tell I haven't clocked that it's him right and then and then he holds his hand out to shake me\n\n01:17:50.360 --> 01:17:56.640\nAnd he's shake my hand.

He throws me away like he wouldn't have done to his shot\n\n01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:11.640\nIt's the second second Joe reference on the same concept. Anyway, he shakes my hand\n\n01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:15.280\nAnd he's like I'm a huge huge fan and right in that moment\n\n01:18:15.280 --> 01:18:18.840\nI'm like he's Lin-Manuel Miranda, and then I'm like and I was like\n\n01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:24.760\nThank you and then like I kind of just turn immediately away like cuz it's just awkward\n\n01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:29.120\nand so it's like now this is me not recognizing him and then\n\n01:18:29.840 --> 01:18:36.000\nTurning his praise of me into just completely blanking him and not returning any praise or being like oh my god\n\n01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:37.800\nThank you so much. It's such a high praise, you know\n\n01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:40.720\nAnd then that's the end of that interaction for the whole night\n\n01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:47.560\nAnd it's just like this guy must think I'm the biggest piece of shit on the planet like the most petty weird aloof guy\n\n01:18:49.560 --> 01:18:52.600\nYou you were embarrassed you and oh shit\n\n01:18:52.600 --> 01:18:55.000\nthis is Lin-Manuel and in your\n\n01:18:56.200 --> 01:18:58.520\nEmbarrassment you did a just a quick turn\n\n01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:05.800\nBut he didn't know you were embarrassed so he like what probably processed that as oh you said I said something nice about you\n\n01:19:05.800 --> 01:19:11.040\nAnd I was like thanks, and you moved.

Yeah, just mountains\n\n01:31:39.960 --> 01:31:43.160\nI was at one of those recently. Oh, just corn is so violent\n\n01:31:45.680 --> 01:31:52.080\nThe eating dismembering crabs. I just like I just like I went to one a couple weeks ago with my buddy Scott and\n\n01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:56.880\nShellfish. Yeah, they're crawling. Yeah, they all get shipped in life. No, I know what they're\n\n01:31:57.120 --> 01:31:59.880\nYeah, they have to be alive. I'm just saying shellfish\n\n01:32:01.040 --> 01:32:07.600\nYeah, but when you see the devastation, okay, it's cool, you know, like they're all alive in a bag\n\n01:32:07.600 --> 01:32:15.120\nI cut open the bag. They put it then they dump all these living creatures in a strainer. Look, I know I but I'm witnessing it\n\n01:32:15.120 --> 01:32:21.200\nOkay, that's why I mean, I know I know what you know. Oh, no, no, you're on my team. I\n\n01:32:21.720 --> 01:32:26.000\nThank you. Yeah, you're honest. I hear Spencer and Dan\n\n01:32:26.840 --> 01:32:31.200\nBut anyway, they're all trying to they're all like freaking out. They're trying to get out climb out of this thing\n\n01:32:31.200 --> 01:32:34.640\nWhy do you think they're trying to get out? They don't want to be on top of each other? I mean, why?\n\n01:32:34.640 --> 01:32:38.680\nWhy do you think they're trying to get out? I don't know Rob? I don't know\n\n01:32:40.680 --> 01:32:43.180\nIs it because they can't wait for Cajun season and spice it?\n\n01:32:46.200 --> 01:32:49.920\nThere's like a hundred of them in there all moving around but it's like bodies\n\n01:32:49.920 --> 01:33:07.920\nStacked up and then they get put in a pot of boiling water. Yeah, and then they get covered and then 10 minutes\n\n01:33:08.080 --> 01:33:12.000\nThey didn't feel anything they didn't feel anything 10 minutes later\n\n01:33:12.120 --> 01:33:19.280\nThey take the the strainer out and then they just dump like a hundred corpses on this table\n\n01:33:19.280 --> 01:33:23.280\nYeah, there's all these yeah, all these people slow down\n\n01:33:27.120 --> 01:33:31.280\nThey pull them in half, and then they eat what looks like the inside\n\n01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:36.480\nThe diet the baby's not the shit tract. It's like brown. It looks like it's like\n\n01:33:37.760 --> 01:33:41.280\nVonnegut would describe a picnic at Roy Rogers. Yeah\n\n01:33:42.320 --> 01:33:44.320\nAnd then at the end you look at the devastation\n\n01:33:44.320 --> 01:33:50.400\nIt's like it's like less than an inch of meat in that thing and I can't imagine it didn't smell good and then it's just like\n\n01:33:51.200 --> 01:33:53.200\nhundreds of corpses on this table\n\n01:33:53.760 --> 01:33:58.320\nI mean at the at the at the crab boil. Are you there saying this? Yeah, because I'm like god\n\n01:33:58.320 --> 01:34:04.480\nSilent green. There's a lot of it's a lot of death. Yeah, buddy. It's a kind of isms inherently.

Yeah, it's an important\n\n01:34:27.440 --> 01:34:32.960\nYeah, it's an important time. It's good. You're just being yourself and that's it. I tried not to say anything\n\n01:34:33.360 --> 01:34:36.960\nNo, no, no, it's a ridiculous thing that we still do that because it's not a lot of meat\n\n01:34:36.960 --> 01:34:42.000\nIt's things with a lot of meat. Maybe it's not a shrimp a shrimp. The whole thing is a is the meat\n\n01:34:45.920 --> 01:34:52.880\nIt's just birthday. Yeah, let him eat crabs. Oh, no. No. Yeah, I'm sorry. Sorry.

Waffle House?\n\n01:35:00.720 --> 01:35:17.600\nYeah, well on top of on top of you guys being black gentlemen, like we're listening to the one Jewish guy is like telling us that shellfish are gross\n\n01:35:18.160 --> 01:35:20.160\nYou knew you felt that way. I mean\n\n01:35:21.280 --> 01:35:23.280\nIt wasn't shellfish. It was like\n\n01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:27.280\nLike I had seen pictures of Jews piled up like that before\n\n01:35:27.280 --> 01:35:31.040\nWhoa. Oh god. Jesus in hand. I have two. Yeah\n\n01:35:31.680 --> 01:35:34.880\nFuck me up, man. I think the Nazis were going. What do you taste?\n\n01:35:38.320 --> 01:35:46.240\nIt's worth it. It tastes good. That's a good point Rob. The Nazis were more moral than people who eat shellfish\n\n01:35:47.040 --> 01:35:48.480\nWow, bro\n\n01:35:48.480 --> 01:35:51.920\nMore moral the Holocaust was basically a clam bake\n\n01:35:51.920 --> 01:36:00.080\nIs what you're saying. Well, I'm sure the Nazis had to to think that the Jews were animals in order to\n\n01:36:00.560 --> 01:36:05.040\nDo horrible things to them, right? Or did they thought they were humans and equals?\n\n01:36:06.160 --> 01:36:08.000\nNo, they had to turn them\n\n01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:13.680\nMentally, they had to process that they were less than them in order to do horrible things to them\n\n01:36:13.680 --> 01:36:21.280\nWell, I'm never gonna I'm never gonna tell you that you should you shouldn't be vegetarian and invest in I will\n\n01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000\nStop it knock it off\n\n01:36:24.320 --> 01:36:26.320\nBut they weekend\n\n01:36:26.400 --> 01:36:32.240\nThank you.

Yeah, and I I'm making it. I thought you made a salient point\n\n01:38:23.520 --> 01:38:26.000\nBut but there's it it just makes the people\n\n01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:33.360\nThey'll dig in more with what they want to do instead of maybe if they're maybe if they're 30 or maybe if they're they they don't\n\n01:38:33.440 --> 01:38:35.440\nI mean, I think we're all\n\n01:38:36.320 --> 01:38:38.240\nreasonably mature\n\n01:38:38.240 --> 01:38:40.240\nif not\n\n01:38:40.400 --> 01:38:46.240\nAging decrepit world weary men that that are perfectly willing to have you know what it is\n\n01:38:46.400 --> 01:38:48.720\nIt's guilt for living a certain way\n\n01:38:49.920 --> 01:38:53.840\nAnd then and waking up and going. Oh my god. What have I been doing?\n\n01:38:53.840 --> 01:38:59.840\nIf we didn't have friends that uh that that went there we wouldn't I mean part of the part of the\n\n01:39:00.560 --> 01:39:01.760\nvery\n\n01:39:01.760 --> 01:39:03.760\nprofound crime of\n\n01:39:04.320 --> 01:39:06.320\ncarnivorous\n\n01:39:06.320 --> 01:39:12.960\nLifestyle is that it's truly mainstream to the point where no one ever has to talk about it. So much as like\n\n01:39:13.520 --> 01:39:19.680\nGay rights or anything that's it's like like like like there's the the oppression is sounds like silence\n\n01:39:19.680 --> 01:39:24.160\nYou know like like no one talking about it at all. So what are you supposed to do except say stuff?\n\n01:39:24.480 --> 01:39:29.120\nAnd yeah, it's a it's a it's a it's a not it's an unenviable position to be the person\n\n01:39:29.520 --> 01:39:34.640\nThat brings it up because the incentive would be to not do that because oh, I want people to like me\n\n01:39:34.640 --> 01:39:36.560\nWhich is like saying it tastes good\n\n01:39:36.560 --> 01:39:38.160\nYou know we try to strike a balance\n\n01:39:38.160 --> 01:39:44.560\nI think I think I like that I have a friend who represents that view and I I perceive myself as hovering around that\n\n01:39:44.560 --> 01:39:50.240\nYou know Kevin Smith told me he he went vegetarian because he or vegan because he just had his heart attack and\n\n01:39:50.800 --> 01:39:56.000\nYou know it and everybody's like all mad at him. You know like like like that's like some kind of\n\n01:39:56.560 --> 01:39:58.560\nlifestyle\n\n01:39:58.800 --> 01:40:01.360\nSomething like it's just like I what I can't eat meat for\n\n01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:05.520\nOne years and then have a heart attack and then stop I used to do that too\n\n01:40:05.520 --> 01:40:08.080\nI used to love Korean barbecue and I remember I\n\n01:40:08.480 --> 01:40:14.000\nAre our good friend Kelsey Abbott is vegetarian.

You're miserable and monday night\n\n01:44:47.840 --> 01:44:54.560\nIt's tuesday eve ready to action ready to party monday night. The m is for marvelous\n\n01:44:58.240 --> 01:45:00.240\nUm, what's the end stand for?\n\n01:45:00.240 --> 01:45:03.840\nUm, night nutsauce blue apron nutsauce\n\n01:45:05.040 --> 01:45:09.040\nWhat uh, what we we used to be on monday's right or was it tuesdays?\n\n01:45:09.680 --> 01:45:12.000\nIt was monday's back in the day and then we went sunday in our\n\n01:45:12.720 --> 01:45:17.120\nSomebody told me I mean we could always we would always have the option of like like well, maybe not at this new place\n\n01:45:17.280 --> 01:45:24.000\nBut like, uh, obviously here, uh, we could be here anytime we wanted we could be here at 3 a.m. on friday\n\n01:45:24.320 --> 01:45:26.320\nUh, well, we pre-record these\n\n01:45:26.320 --> 01:45:34.320\nIn it, but but somebody told me that saturdays and fridays are like bad nights for comedy in terms of live audiences\n\n01:45:34.800 --> 01:45:39.200\nSaturdays are great fridays are rough. Okay. Why because of because people are tired\n\n01:45:39.200 --> 01:45:46.000\nSo you the the myth is friday second show is the worst show you'll do all the all week because because who's tired\n\n01:45:46.160 --> 01:45:48.160\nIt's friday night because it's tired of work\n\n01:45:48.400 --> 01:45:53.600\nYeah, that's why the groundlings the groundlings second show is always either either cooking with gas or the new shows\n\n01:45:53.600 --> 01:45:58.480\nThat the new sketches are trying out and then they yeah, and even at every comedy show in the city\n\n01:45:58.480 --> 01:46:02.400\nIt's going to be like fucking friday second shows the worst. They're really drunk by then\n\n01:46:03.120 --> 01:46:04.240\nUsually too\n\n01:46:04.240 --> 01:46:07.520\nSo if you jump in your car and you come straight to the comedy show great\n\n01:46:07.920 --> 01:46:12.080\nBut if you are at home pre-partying and then you show up at the comedy show you're like fuck this place\n\n01:46:12.720 --> 01:46:16.000\nBoth shows saturday are wonderful because people put it in their plans. They know they're doing it\n\n01:46:16.400 --> 01:46:22.000\nYeah, and they sleep in and then they saturday is okay. I get it.
