WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Ladies and gentlemen, if you're listening to this, you're dead somewhere.

00:07.000 --> 00:09.440
Hopefully you're high enough.

00:09.440 --> 00:11.760
So glad to be speaking to you from downtown Burbank.

00:11.760 --> 00:17.800
I'm so excited to be standing in for Jeff Davis, such big shoes and an even bigger jockstrap.

00:17.800 --> 00:21.560
I'm Brandon Johnson, I'll be controlling tonight, but first let's get into it.

00:21.560 --> 00:26.840
Your man, the craziest, the king of all time.

00:26.840 --> 00:31.600
Steve Harvey called him one of his favorite comedians, Spencer Crittenden.

00:31.600 --> 00:35.960
Spencer Crittenden, ladies and gentlemen, big fan.

00:35.960 --> 00:41.480
Now, if I'm the disgraced alderman, this man is definitely the mayor.

00:41.480 --> 00:45.800
You've seen him on black hair care boxes all over the city of Los Angeles.

00:45.800 --> 00:50.360
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the stage, your mayor, Dan Harmon.

00:50.360 --> 00:56.280
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.

00:56.280 --> 01:01.440
Rap it to the beat, rap, rap, master, Dan.

01:01.440 --> 01:07.760
Harmon is rapping now, it's time for rap.

01:07.760 --> 01:17.880
Rapping is the way to do the way you do your life.

01:17.880 --> 01:28.200
Beat your peas with lots of geese, liver, smear down a butter knife, drummer, wicked.

01:28.200 --> 01:37.680
I'm a rapper, wrapping my heart out, dancing a little bit too, but not so much that I hurt

01:37.680 --> 01:38.680
myself.

01:38.680 --> 01:43.240
I'm a little hungover from New York, and I'm in a bad mood.

01:43.240 --> 01:46.160
I find most people stupid.

01:46.160 --> 01:51.720
Don't even like my own friends.

01:51.720 --> 01:56.520
Or my family, most of whom don't like to speak to me.

01:56.520 --> 01:58.560
I have a niece I never met.

01:58.560 --> 02:06.560
I'm a rapper, wrapping to the beat tonight, moving my feet in a way that's right.

02:06.560 --> 02:15.400
Blue apron, have the braised nuts with the spaghetti reduction sauce.

02:15.400 --> 02:29.520
Blue apron, square, space, air, B and B, Southwest Airlines, quip, quip, quip, a quip, toothbrush.

02:29.520 --> 02:35.920
Suck the brush to your mirror, hold your brush much nearer, clean it up, make it wiggle round,

02:35.920 --> 02:41.760
brush your teeth with the gums when you found a treasure, or a treasure map.

02:41.760 --> 02:49.080
That's the name of this rap, treasure map, leisure crap.

02:49.080 --> 02:51.000
I'm a quipped toothed brusher.

02:51.000 --> 02:54.800
I couldn't have cleaner teeth if my name was busher.

02:54.800 --> 03:03.720
I like to brush, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, thrush, quail, thrush out the quail from the bush,

03:03.720 --> 03:10.440
well you brush your teeth and you tush, get that brush up your butt hole, put the quip

03:10.440 --> 03:17.480
in your butt, rub it around, tell it you're not, what's does your prostate, make the semen

03:17.480 --> 03:20.480
come out.

03:20.480 --> 03:28.480
It vibrates every 45 seconds to cue you to put into a different part of your butt hole.

03:28.480 --> 03:40.280
I'm a rapper, I'm a rapper, I'm a rapper, I'm a rapper, I'm a rapper, I'm a rapper, I'm a rapper.

03:40.280 --> 03:53.400
I think I almost, I don't know about the faint, alright thank you, welcome to the show, yay.

03:53.400 --> 04:03.080
Hardest line in hip hop ever, I have a niece I haven't met, such tragedy, the pain in that

04:03.080 --> 04:09.400
line, we all felt it.

04:09.400 --> 04:24.840
That was pretty hard, that was sad as fuck, I have a niece I haven't met, Jesus Christ.

04:24.840 --> 04:35.840
Well we've got a horrible, horrible show for you tonight, Not in the Mood, I had a great

04:35.840 --> 04:41.280
time in New York but a self-destructive one, I mean I really alarmed myself and Cody.

04:41.280 --> 04:43.280
What were you doing in New York?

04:43.280 --> 04:53.240
I was just drinking, I was also, I was premiering, I was attending the premiere of a movie I

04:53.240 --> 04:59.720
was in, the title of which is Very Long and starts with the word Seven Stages, I think

04:59.720 --> 05:07.920
if you google Seven Stages, Harmon or Holy Storch which is played by Taika Waititi, Kate

05:07.920 --> 05:13.120
McCuchy's in it, Sam Huntington, they're amazing, I mean McCuchy, I don't want to play

05:13.120 --> 05:18.840
favorites or whatever but it's like she exactly produced the movie and she's just, she's so

05:18.840 --> 05:19.840
fantastic in it.

05:19.840 --> 05:20.840
Very genius, yeah.

05:20.840 --> 05:21.840
Very genius.

05:21.840 --> 05:32.000
There's a lot of, there's a lot of really cool alternative, I don't know what you, there's

05:32.000 --> 05:37.000
very hip, funny people in it that have much smaller roles than me and I'm incredibly fat

05:37.000 --> 05:41.400
in it and make me feel great because I felt like I lost weight when I watched it, I was

05:41.400 --> 05:44.600
like wow look how fat you are on the screen.

05:44.600 --> 05:48.000
The camera adds a lot of self-hate.

05:48.000 --> 05:59.080
Yeah, I mean I was at the, I was in the bathroom in my New York hotel room and I was a night

05:59.080 --> 06:07.360
of drinking and I had a good time and then I'm like just brushing my teeth and I think

06:07.360 --> 06:13.240
I believe that this is what I did, I had to tell the staff, I'm sorry I broke a light

06:13.240 --> 06:20.240
bulb, like a, like the glass ball that covers the bulb but I didn't tell them, I did it

06:20.240 --> 06:25.720
on purpose because that would be insane but I think that's what I did, I was like looking

06:25.720 --> 06:34.040
at it and then I just reached out and pulled it off and dropped it on the floor of the

06:34.040 --> 06:35.040
bathroom.

06:35.040 --> 06:36.040
Okay.

06:36.040 --> 06:40.640
That's fucking badass man, that's metal as fuck.

06:40.640 --> 06:45.360
I mean that's how you know your life is going pretty well, you're just like making up disasters.

06:45.360 --> 06:47.560
Did it satisfy you?

06:47.560 --> 06:54.320
No, I just kind of looked at it and was like huh, what was that, what was that behavior?

06:54.320 --> 06:55.320
It was weird.

06:55.320 --> 06:59.160
I told the lady at the front desk, I'm really sorry, obviously I'm going to pay for it but

06:59.160 --> 07:03.320
I don't want the staff to get hurt, there's broken glass on the floor and she's like yeah

07:03.320 --> 07:09.000
you seem like you're in pretty high spirits and I was like yeah I'm quite drunk.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
So she deserved it?

07:10.000 --> 07:13.080
Well, I don't know, she was nice, she was very nice.

07:13.080 --> 07:16.320
I like that you knew that these people were going to be jerks at this hotel if something

07:16.320 --> 07:17.320
should go wrong.

07:17.320 --> 07:22.680
I just outed, I'm going to prove it's like when an adopted kid sets fire to their foster

07:22.680 --> 07:29.240
parents living room and then they're like you piece of shit, he's like see.

07:29.240 --> 07:31.320
Were you in high spirits?

07:31.320 --> 07:32.640
I was drunk.

07:32.640 --> 07:33.640
Right.

07:33.640 --> 07:36.640
Yeah, I had a great time, you know who's a great guy that I would really love to hang

07:36.640 --> 07:41.040
out with here in L.A. and I'm sure I'll come on the show and Mark McKinney, I'd never,

07:41.040 --> 07:45.000
I think that was the last kid in the hall that I've met.

07:45.000 --> 07:49.800
Yeah, Canadians are good people, they're nice, there's no bravada.

07:49.800 --> 07:56.200
Yeah, he's a very, I risk insulting him by sounding shocked by this but he's just a very

07:56.200 --> 08:05.800
funny guy, very witty, charming and friendly and he likes to drink, he's Canadian, they

08:05.800 --> 08:06.800
like to drink.

08:06.800 --> 08:11.240
They're basically like Milwaukeeans in Canada, you know.

08:11.240 --> 08:12.240
Does he live in L.A.?

08:12.240 --> 08:13.680
Is there a chance that you guys could have a play date?

08:13.680 --> 08:19.920
Yeah, I think he's in Toronto a lot but he is also living here and I think, yeah, I can't

08:19.920 --> 08:24.880
remember what his exact schedule is but we did exchange digits and I think he'd be a

08:24.880 --> 08:26.120
great guest on the show.

08:26.120 --> 08:27.120
Awesome.

08:27.120 --> 08:28.120
What else?

08:28.120 --> 08:31.720
Also, and then I want to know about the garage, fixed?

08:31.720 --> 08:37.920
It's fixed at this point, it just has to be painted, doesn't have an address on it yet.

08:37.920 --> 08:39.800
That's not a big deal, I'm not going to let that get to me.

08:39.800 --> 08:40.800
Okay.

08:40.800 --> 08:46.320
I don't really need a garage, I don't have a car but it's good that it's fixed, I guess.

08:46.320 --> 08:47.320
Okay.

08:47.320 --> 08:52.480
A little less urban blight on my block.

08:52.480 --> 08:58.960
What's with the grit in Bloody Marys, what is that?

08:58.960 --> 09:06.600
Why is part of a Bloody Mary just gross little chunky balls of black like fucking shit?

09:06.600 --> 09:08.600
It's peppercorns.

09:08.600 --> 09:12.160
What the fuck, you ordered it.

09:12.160 --> 09:18.680
You know I was a bartender, so yeah man, you don't want to order the shit with the shit

09:18.680 --> 09:19.680
in it.

09:19.680 --> 09:25.200
Yeah, well, I just, so can I say when I order a Bloody Mary, can I say can you not with

09:25.200 --> 09:26.200
a peppercorn?

09:26.200 --> 09:27.200
Yes.

09:27.200 --> 09:28.200
Okay.

09:28.200 --> 09:32.160
Because I kind of like every once in a while I'll be in the mood for a Bloody Mary but then

09:32.160 --> 09:37.000
I remember I'd like have shoots up through the straw, this fucking like shitty little

09:37.000 --> 09:46.400
beady of charcoal and then you take out the straw, you try to drink around it, you get

09:46.400 --> 09:51.920
the fucking balls of pepper on your mustache, it's fucking gross, what a gross drink, what

09:51.920 --> 09:56.000
a terrible, terrible thing to do to somebody.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.320
So Mark, was it hotel or was it out?

09:58.320 --> 09:59.320
Were you out?

09:59.320 --> 10:04.440
I had a Bloody Mary at the standard with, I wasn't staying at the standard but I went

10:04.440 --> 10:09.120
there to drink and wait for our car to come.

10:09.120 --> 10:10.120
Okay.

10:10.120 --> 10:12.440
Not a bad choice.

10:12.440 --> 10:16.720
Baby boomers are bad people, I wrote that down.

10:16.720 --> 10:21.160
They're almost dead but the ones that are left, you know, kind of destroying.

10:21.160 --> 10:22.160
Why do you feel like they're bad people?

10:22.160 --> 10:25.640
Is it because of the events of late or do you feel like they blew it through the 60s

10:25.640 --> 10:26.640
and 70s?

10:26.640 --> 10:31.800
I guess the former, they're just not aging very well at all, they're becoming villains

10:31.800 --> 10:36.360
and I mean maybe the good ones died at like 65.

10:36.360 --> 10:39.400
There's also a lot of assassination.

10:39.400 --> 10:45.000
And now we are left with mummies and assassins.

10:45.000 --> 10:50.400
So don't take it personal, if you have a baby boomer in your life, maybe they're a ghost

10:50.400 --> 10:55.800
or an angel, but if they're alive, they're probably a piece of shit, pretty much.

10:55.800 --> 10:57.560
Or they invented street lights.

10:57.560 --> 10:59.360
They invented street lights, that's true.

10:59.360 --> 11:04.160
They were the dude that was like, we should use glue for concrete, you know, so we have.

11:04.160 --> 11:08.560
Remember I see an old person, I'm like, this motherfucker might be the person who invented

11:08.560 --> 11:14.000
those bags that hang over you in surgery with the saline in them, right, so I'm like, be

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
nice, you know.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
Be nice!

11:16.000 --> 11:19.240
Because if they invented it, they might be able to recall them.

11:19.240 --> 11:20.240
Right.

11:20.240 --> 11:27.400
They might be standing at an operating table with a brick hanging over you, with a hose

11:27.400 --> 11:29.400
coming down in your arm.

11:29.400 --> 11:33.760
How great would it be if old people could recall technology?

11:33.760 --> 11:39.160
I didn't invent street lights so that all these immigrants could come to my country,

11:39.160 --> 11:41.160
I'm turning them off!

11:41.160 --> 11:44.800
I said the music's too loud, now give us back the subwoofer!

11:44.800 --> 11:47.800
Nobody gets the subwoofer!

11:47.800 --> 11:50.480
You all have to use two tweeters.

11:50.480 --> 11:51.480
Too much rap!

11:51.480 --> 11:52.480
Too much rap!

11:52.480 --> 11:56.360
I want to hear the Beatles'.

11:56.360 --> 12:03.240
Well it's kind of interesting, Brandon, you, in singing the praises of our previous generation,

12:03.240 --> 12:07.560
you really went to some less likely places than people usually go, I usually go to the

12:07.560 --> 12:13.760
Ed Sullivan Beatles moon thing, and you're talking glue and concrete, that's interesting.

12:13.760 --> 12:17.040
No, Spencer, how are you?

12:17.040 --> 12:18.600
I'm good.

12:18.600 --> 12:19.600
Look at him.

12:19.600 --> 12:20.600
What's going on?

12:20.600 --> 12:21.600
Yeah, why would you?

12:21.600 --> 12:22.600
Fighting him.

12:22.600 --> 12:23.600
But we're fighting.

12:23.600 --> 12:24.600
What are you guys fighting about?

12:24.600 --> 12:30.360
We got Blue Apron the other day, and Spencer wouldn't let me make glazed nutsauce with

12:30.360 --> 12:31.520
a reduction bouillabaisse.

12:31.520 --> 12:32.520
How is apron?

12:32.520 --> 12:33.520
Get it?

12:33.520 --> 12:38.920
It's a blow job joke.

12:38.920 --> 12:41.320
I bet Blue Apron's going to love that.

12:41.320 --> 12:43.600
Yeah, I mean, thanks.

12:43.600 --> 12:50.880
Yeah, they hate being talked about, nuts, just nuts, what kind of sauce is what you

12:50.880 --> 12:51.880
should be asking?

12:51.880 --> 13:00.600
It's a nut sauce, a bouillabaisse reduction.

13:00.600 --> 13:10.440
If you're just joining us, I'm in a bad mood, I'm hungover.

13:10.440 --> 13:14.480
Get through the TSA checkpoint as we all do when we travel.

13:14.480 --> 13:15.480
You have to, even.

13:15.480 --> 13:21.960
I didn't even have a bad time personally, I don't understand why they are upset.

13:21.960 --> 13:23.480
Why are they upset?

13:23.480 --> 13:26.720
What in the fuck did they think was going to happen?

13:26.720 --> 13:28.160
They don't make a lot of money.

13:28.160 --> 13:29.480
I don't fucking care.

13:29.480 --> 13:34.600
I'm sorry, I'm yelling at you, I'm asking you to defend them, but everybody makes not

13:34.600 --> 13:36.680
a lot of money except me.

13:36.680 --> 13:39.960
Yeah, it's great.

13:39.960 --> 13:41.360
I love it.

13:41.360 --> 13:42.360
It's great.

13:42.360 --> 13:48.600
Big piles of money and you can roll around in it and you can buy food.

13:48.600 --> 13:49.600
Yes.

13:49.600 --> 13:54.320
But I was poor once, I was a dishwasher, I didn't make enough money.

13:54.320 --> 13:58.360
There were too many dirty dishes, I wished that there were less, I wished that they

13:58.360 --> 14:01.520
were cleaner when they came to me, but I was a dishwasher.

14:01.520 --> 14:03.200
That's how they feel about you all.

14:03.200 --> 14:04.200
Exactly.

14:04.200 --> 14:05.200
I wish you were cleaner.

14:05.200 --> 14:09.320
There's too many of you, you're all in a bad mood, you're all running late.

14:09.320 --> 14:10.960
And we don't understand.

14:10.960 --> 14:12.880
And they're trying to save your life and you give them shit.

14:12.880 --> 14:14.600
They're trying to save our life.

14:14.600 --> 14:15.600
It's true.

14:15.600 --> 14:16.600
That's how the TSA feels.

14:16.600 --> 14:19.440
They're like, we're the janitors.

14:19.440 --> 14:22.320
Then they should smile.

14:22.320 --> 14:27.800
If they think they're saving people's lives, they should, like Superman's, very happy.

14:27.800 --> 14:29.320
What if they wear capes?

14:29.320 --> 14:30.320
They could wear capes.

14:30.320 --> 14:31.320
Yeah.

14:31.320 --> 14:33.560
Well, we should make them, we should let them wear capes.

14:33.560 --> 14:36.200
No, we should make them wear capes.

14:36.200 --> 14:38.480
And then make them feel good about that.

14:38.480 --> 14:44.480
Or maybe they should, like, I just, maybe what happened yesterday is probably going

14:44.480 --> 14:50.120
to happen today, i.e. a bunch of people who are not always in an airport are going to

14:50.120 --> 14:52.920
come to an airport for the first time in a while.

14:52.920 --> 14:58.320
Some of them from foreign countries, all of them at non-ideal times in their lives, none

14:58.320 --> 15:05.880
of them having gotten up that morning, uh, eager to pull their shoes off and put their

15:05.880 --> 15:08.640
belts in a liquid bag.

15:08.640 --> 15:15.920
No one, but they get to be there and be used to it.

15:15.920 --> 15:19.600
They get to be native to the place that we hate to be.

15:19.600 --> 15:23.880
But what I don't understand is, why are they so cranky?

15:23.880 --> 15:28.760
I just wish they would be mad at the right people, because there are people that don't

15:28.760 --> 15:33.440
get their laptops out, and then there are people who don't take their jackets off.

15:33.440 --> 15:36.200
And then those people aren't the ones they get mad at.

15:36.200 --> 15:40.400
They're always just like, oh, you have a phone.

15:40.400 --> 15:42.520
It's like, yeah, everybody has a fucking phone.

15:42.520 --> 15:43.680
But it's like, shut up.

15:43.680 --> 15:48.160
But it's like, they're always mad about stupid shit, or they're like mad about, like, I don't

15:48.160 --> 15:50.560
know, someone's not hearing them.

15:50.560 --> 15:52.680
And it's like, yeah, I mean, everyone's yelling.

15:52.680 --> 15:53.680
Yeah, no one can hear it.

15:53.680 --> 15:54.680
Here's a thought.

15:54.680 --> 15:55.680
Okay.

15:55.680 --> 16:03.400
If where you work, this goes beyond the TSA, but this is like, if where you work, is

16:03.400 --> 16:12.040
there is a sign that says what everyone's supposed to do, and you find yourself repeatedly

16:12.040 --> 16:20.440
and exasperatingly pointing at the sign and saying, it's on the sign.

16:20.440 --> 16:26.560
What we call that in the sign business is a nonworking sign.

16:26.560 --> 16:28.200
That's called a bad sign.

16:28.200 --> 16:30.520
It's not working correctly.

16:30.520 --> 16:37.920
So it's not really 40,000 strangers fault that they're not seeing the sign or taking

16:37.920 --> 16:38.920
it into their hearts.

16:38.920 --> 16:42.680
See, it really can't be 40,000 people's fault.

16:42.680 --> 16:47.240
40,000 people can't really do anything wrong on purpose.

16:47.240 --> 16:48.240
Whoa.

16:48.240 --> 16:49.240
Hold on.

16:49.240 --> 16:50.240
Let's hold on.

16:50.240 --> 16:51.240
Yeah.

16:51.240 --> 16:52.240
Let's back up.

16:52.240 --> 16:53.240
40,000 strangers.

16:53.240 --> 16:55.240
Let's emphasize that they're strangers to each other.

16:55.240 --> 16:59.360
Are they strangers in Germany?

16:59.360 --> 17:02.440
There's people showing up for, they're not strangers.

17:02.440 --> 17:06.480
They're like in a moose lodge kind of organization, and they're like, let's set fire to this

17:06.480 --> 17:10.800
church or something.

17:10.800 --> 17:11.800
But let's say.

17:11.800 --> 17:12.960
They hated that church.

17:12.960 --> 17:14.520
Well, but wait a minute.

17:14.520 --> 17:15.520
No, no, don't.

17:15.520 --> 17:17.520
I want to go back.

17:17.520 --> 17:20.200
There is no exception to what I'm saying, because we're saying wrong.

17:20.200 --> 17:23.440
I'm saying the sign is wrong, because it's not working.

17:23.440 --> 17:28.880
If you're at a Nazi rally, and with 40,000 Nazis, and there's a sign that says no cell

17:28.880 --> 17:34.080
phones, and all the other Nazis are on their cell phone, before you go like, guys, you're

17:34.080 --> 17:40.880
being bad Nazis and point the sign, move the sign, make it the text bigger, change the

17:40.880 --> 17:41.880
color scheme.

17:41.880 --> 17:42.880
Stop being Nazis.

17:42.880 --> 17:43.880
Say what?

17:43.880 --> 17:44.880
Stop being Nazis.

17:44.880 --> 17:46.480
Don't worry about your cell phones.

17:46.480 --> 17:47.480
Just go home.

17:47.480 --> 17:52.080
Yeah, but you're, I mean, that's not, I, yeah, but the, the, sure that too, that would be

17:52.080 --> 17:53.080
great.

17:53.080 --> 17:54.080
But yeah.

17:54.080 --> 17:55.080
We're talking about signs.

17:55.080 --> 17:56.080
Yeah.

17:56.080 --> 17:57.080
We're talking about trying to improve science.

17:57.080 --> 18:02.440
I mean, don't be a fucking Nazi about my metaphors.

18:02.440 --> 18:05.960
I think you said a lot of people couldn't be wrong, and I was like, I feel like a lot

18:05.960 --> 18:09.600
of people are often wrong, but I take your point about bad design.

18:09.600 --> 18:10.600
Semantics.

18:10.600 --> 18:11.600
Semantics.

18:11.600 --> 18:12.600
Yeah.

18:12.600 --> 18:13.600
Everyone is all wrong about everything.

18:13.600 --> 18:14.600
We're, we're born monsters.

18:14.600 --> 18:17.440
We're terrible monkey people that fucking suck and eat dicks.

18:17.440 --> 18:21.680
But what about the, you know, isn't there a tendency of people to ignore signs anyway?

18:21.680 --> 18:29.440
That, like, like, I mean, I, I agree, like, I agree that a bad sign is like, can be marked

18:29.440 --> 18:32.200
by the fact that people don't read it, but at the same time there's like doors that

18:32.200 --> 18:35.480
say push and pull, and then people just don't look and stuff like that.

18:35.480 --> 18:36.480
Bad sign.

18:36.480 --> 18:38.760
Well, I mean, not working, not working.

18:38.760 --> 18:40.520
The whole experience is not working.

18:40.520 --> 18:41.520
Yeah.

18:41.520 --> 18:42.520
Yeah.

18:42.520 --> 18:43.520
And the signs part of the whole experience.

18:43.520 --> 18:44.520
Yeah.

18:44.520 --> 18:46.080
I think whoever put up the sign at a noble effort, but I don't know, however long the

18:46.080 --> 18:49.560
sign's been up there and however mad you are that people aren't pushing and pulling,

18:49.560 --> 18:52.720
that's it, you gotta, it's not, it's really not logical.

18:52.720 --> 18:54.320
It's not gonna, it's not gonna work.

18:54.320 --> 18:58.400
It's like, the people are a force of nature there when they're moving through a door.

18:58.400 --> 19:03.920
But people don't have incentive to read every written information around, you know, we kind

19:03.920 --> 19:04.920
of like, who cares?

19:04.920 --> 19:05.920
Yeah, they don't.

19:05.920 --> 19:06.920
They don't.

19:06.920 --> 19:07.920
Right.

19:07.920 --> 19:08.920
So dumb sign.

19:08.920 --> 19:09.920
It's not working.

19:09.920 --> 19:10.920
It's not going to work.

19:10.920 --> 19:11.920
People don't work like that.

19:11.920 --> 19:13.920
There's no sign that people are gonna read.

19:13.920 --> 19:14.920
Right.

19:14.920 --> 19:16.920
Particularly if the experience is the same experience.

19:16.920 --> 19:18.720
Or if it's telling them to do something.

19:18.720 --> 19:23.880
You've got to figure out a new way to make people do stuff you don't want them doing.

19:23.880 --> 19:30.080
What if we get someone to yell the same thing over and over until they want to kill everybody?

19:30.080 --> 19:31.080
Sure.

19:31.080 --> 19:37.120
Or add a class to their grade schools and wait 20 years for everyone to become better

19:37.120 --> 19:38.600
pushers and pullers of doors.

19:38.600 --> 19:39.600
I don't know.

19:39.600 --> 19:41.200
We should start that right now, I think.

19:41.200 --> 19:45.200
Well, we ought to, if we, if we're gonna be mad 20 years from now about people not staying

19:45.200 --> 19:52.960
off the grass, we should, we should, we should give them grass feet, special vitamins that

19:52.960 --> 19:54.480
make their feet grass.

19:54.480 --> 19:55.840
These pants brought the grump out in you.

19:55.840 --> 19:58.680
I'm a very angry man in his pajamas.

19:58.680 --> 19:59.680
Yeah.

19:59.680 --> 20:04.280
I just, I just, why is everyone so dumb?

20:04.280 --> 20:08.800
Why is everyone so stupid and mean and ugly?

20:08.800 --> 20:09.800
It's a rhetorical question.

20:09.800 --> 20:11.040
I thought you said you had fun in New York.

20:11.040 --> 20:12.040
I did.

20:12.040 --> 20:13.040
I did have fun.

20:13.040 --> 20:14.040
Tell me, what else did you do?

20:14.040 --> 20:15.880
I, it was mostly, it was a lot of.

20:15.880 --> 20:16.880
Who'd you go with?

20:16.880 --> 20:17.880
Uh, Dino.

20:17.880 --> 20:18.880
Oh, fuck.

20:18.880 --> 20:19.880
Yeah.

20:19.880 --> 20:24.200
So you've got to have some stories.

20:24.200 --> 20:25.200
I do.

20:25.200 --> 20:30.520
I mean, that you, you know, yeah, I have to think, let's bring Rob Schrab up while I,

20:30.520 --> 20:32.320
while I can think about that.

20:32.320 --> 20:33.320
Rob Schrab.

20:33.320 --> 20:35.880
Ladies and gentlemen, Rob Schrab.

20:35.880 --> 20:42.320
Back from his tour in 48 continental states on the Schrab hour, the Schrab tour, Schrab

20:42.320 --> 20:44.440
tour merchandise will be available after the show.

20:44.440 --> 20:52.840
Rob Schrab coming to the stage, saw his mama's pussy on the page, fade in on mama Schrab's

20:52.840 --> 20:55.760
vagina got robbed.

20:55.760 --> 21:02.000
I'm a stick up artist robbing your pussy, put your hands in the air, give me your tushy.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.520
I'm just trying to feed my family.

21:04.520 --> 21:05.520
Rob your pussy.

21:05.520 --> 21:06.520
Stram, I mean, hello.

21:06.520 --> 21:07.520
Hello, Dan.

21:07.520 --> 21:14.640
How was your trip to New York?

21:14.640 --> 21:15.640
It was good.

21:15.640 --> 21:20.680
I broke a light bulb, you know, like, like, like, like, like, like I'm like, uh, like

21:20.680 --> 21:26.920
I was a rapper, like you were destroying an idea apocalypse now where he smashes the

21:26.920 --> 21:27.920
mirror.

21:27.920 --> 21:28.920
Yeah.

21:28.920 --> 21:36.680
But I think honestly, wasn't that, uh, man, uh, uh, uh, scavenging.

21:36.680 --> 21:39.280
A rapper, I think, loots a hotel room.

21:39.280 --> 21:42.680
It took so long to plan that.

21:42.680 --> 21:48.480
I spent some sense of it, but I was, I, well, I did that guy that is not, it's not, it's

21:48.480 --> 21:53.560
not a joking matter, but it's a happy, happy, it's a happier ending to the story.

21:53.560 --> 21:59.200
That guy that saved everybody at the Waffle House, not everybody, um, yeah, but it's always

21:59.200 --> 22:00.200
cool, right?

22:00.200 --> 22:06.120
You know, something funny like the guy because he, he, he, he looted the, the mass shooting

22:06.120 --> 22:09.840
thing, or he like, uh, he, he's, he's like, like the headline was good Fox news was going

22:09.840 --> 22:13.440
to say that he stole, he stole a gun and that is the thing.

22:13.440 --> 22:17.200
It is kind of funny that yes, he got the gun from the dude and then the cops showed up

22:17.200 --> 22:18.200
and shot him.

22:18.200 --> 22:19.200
Wait, shut up.

22:19.200 --> 22:23.080
The cops shot the fucking hero guy shot the hero guy because they were like, because

22:23.080 --> 22:24.080
he was holding a gun.

22:24.080 --> 22:25.080
Oh my God.

22:25.080 --> 22:28.040
They were like, they didn't know who was who if they'd heard shots or fired, I had no idea

22:28.040 --> 22:29.040
that happened.

22:29.040 --> 22:30.040
That is a fucking bummer.

22:30.040 --> 22:32.600
I'm lying, but this is where we are, America.

22:32.600 --> 22:33.600
That's straight up.

22:33.600 --> 22:34.600
This is where we are.

22:34.600 --> 22:36.480
That's night of the living dead.

22:36.480 --> 22:37.480
Yeah.

22:37.480 --> 22:40.520
There aren't, there aren't any, I mean, I don't, I don't know if the police aren't supposed

22:40.520 --> 22:44.840
to necessarily know this, the guy's holding a gun, but, but, but just, just to make the

22:44.840 --> 22:45.840
observation.

22:45.840 --> 22:48.360
This is usually a, it's usually a white guy, right?

22:48.360 --> 22:49.360
Right.

22:49.360 --> 22:50.360
What?

22:50.360 --> 22:51.360
What?

22:51.360 --> 23:00.400
Did you just start a different podcast at the same time as I was at the same time?

23:00.400 --> 23:05.840
The problem, I mean, it illustrates the problem with a gun incident, which is that it's a

23:05.840 --> 23:10.640
highly chaotic information or situation in which a lot of information changes at a very

23:10.640 --> 23:12.040
fast pace.

23:12.040 --> 23:17.840
And even having a gun in a shooting situation can be a liability that gets you killed instead

23:17.840 --> 23:19.040
of protected.

23:19.040 --> 23:22.960
So like, that's just inherent to the beast and like, this is exactly why.

23:22.960 --> 23:28.920
I mean, say that guy had a gun, say that guy shot the shooter, say he did it before he

23:28.920 --> 23:30.600
got any casualties.

23:30.600 --> 23:35.080
That guy still might have ended up dead because, you know, he was the guy who had a gun when

23:35.080 --> 23:36.080
the cops showed up.

23:36.080 --> 23:37.080
And that's just what happened.

23:37.080 --> 23:42.200
The bullet might go through the, the, the potential murderer, the hero's bullet could

23:42.200 --> 23:48.120
go through his entire body and hit a baby, especially in a, from an assault rifle.

23:48.120 --> 23:51.200
Or they could just shoot a baby instead of hitting the perpetrator and then the perpetrator

23:51.200 --> 23:54.080
pops like six shots off and it runs off or, you know, who knows?

23:54.080 --> 23:55.080
I mean, yeah.

23:55.080 --> 24:01.040
Also, also here's the thing about this, everybody needs to have a gun concept, which is, that's

24:01.040 --> 24:02.040
not freedom.

24:02.040 --> 24:04.440
I don't, I don't want to have a gun in public.

24:04.440 --> 24:09.680
I don't, I, I bear, I, I, I immediately, as soon as I could get rid of my wallet and

24:09.680 --> 24:12.800
put all my credit cards in my phone case, do you think I want to, I want to stop at

24:12.800 --> 24:18.360
the counter before I go out the door and load a 45 or a heavier, it's, it's ridiculous.

24:18.360 --> 24:20.360
I don't even like carrying a laptop.

24:20.360 --> 24:21.760
I don't think you want to do that.

24:21.760 --> 24:23.440
I don't want to have a gun.

24:23.440 --> 24:25.960
I don't think you want to have a gun outside.

24:25.960 --> 24:29.800
You know who might or might not our classic character, MC gun control.

24:29.800 --> 24:30.800
Oh shit.

24:30.800 --> 24:31.800
Oh shit.

24:31.800 --> 24:38.920
Yo, it's me, MC gun control, the character where the joke is that you can't tell if he's

24:38.920 --> 24:49.480
a four or against guns, MC gun awareness, bang, bang, shoot, shoot, bang, a lot of guns out

24:49.480 --> 24:54.440
there in a gang or not in a shooter's hands.

24:54.440 --> 25:00.840
It's a crazy second amendment land, got the guns, they're dangerous, powerful weapons

25:00.840 --> 25:02.800
for all of us.

25:02.800 --> 25:05.800
MC gun control.

25:05.800 --> 25:08.880
You can't tell what side I'm on.

25:08.880 --> 25:10.960
So now MC gun control.

25:10.960 --> 25:12.800
Oh, oh, oh, yes.

25:12.800 --> 25:19.440
In the past, you have at least said the words gun control a fair amount, which has led to

25:19.440 --> 25:24.080
there to be like the perception of some amount of balance where you're talking about gun

25:24.080 --> 25:25.080
control.

25:25.080 --> 25:29.280
Yeah, my job is to spread awareness, make people aware of gun control.

25:29.280 --> 25:33.360
But at this point, you were just like talking about a landscape of guns and things people

25:33.360 --> 25:34.360
could do with guns.

25:34.360 --> 25:38.560
This is the most lethal nation in the United States of the world.

25:38.560 --> 25:40.600
But you weren't even mentioning gun control at all.

25:40.600 --> 25:44.600
You're just kind of like, you're almost just promoting guns and the things you could do.

25:44.600 --> 25:46.760
It's almost impossible to control guns.

25:46.760 --> 25:48.160
They're out of control.

25:48.160 --> 25:50.120
It's the awareness.

25:50.120 --> 25:54.160
Guns are incredible killing machines.

25:54.160 --> 25:55.480
Right.

25:55.480 --> 25:56.480
You keep saying that.

25:56.480 --> 25:57.480
Yeah.

25:57.480 --> 25:58.480
And you keep saying.

25:58.480 --> 26:00.760
Well, then I've done, I'm glad you're aware.

26:00.760 --> 26:04.080
You keep saying anyone who wants to kill should get a gun.

26:04.080 --> 26:09.960
No, I did not, I don't, that would be a, that would probably be an accidental breaching

26:09.960 --> 26:15.720
of the comedic formula because I would, that would be like it's Pat saying that she's

26:15.720 --> 26:16.720
a woman.

26:16.720 --> 26:20.600
Well, I mean, that's implying that people who want to kill people are good.

26:20.600 --> 26:22.000
Oh, thank you.

26:22.000 --> 26:23.000
Okay.

26:23.000 --> 26:24.000
All right.

26:24.000 --> 26:27.640
But anyway, the joke is you can't tell.

26:27.640 --> 26:30.440
I mean, you did say incredible killing machine.

26:30.440 --> 26:31.440
Yeah.

26:31.440 --> 26:32.440
Yeah.

26:32.440 --> 26:37.920
I'm, I, it's, it's the word incredible means hard to believe.

26:37.920 --> 26:43.080
And you did say the wounds that guns create were like amazing.

26:43.080 --> 26:45.080
They're remarkable.

26:45.080 --> 26:46.080
Right.

26:46.080 --> 26:47.080
They're remarkable.

26:47.080 --> 26:48.080
That's what you said.

26:48.080 --> 26:49.080
I'm sorry.

26:49.080 --> 26:50.080
They're not worthy.

26:50.080 --> 26:51.080
That's, no, that's more neutral.

26:51.080 --> 26:52.080
That's true.

26:52.080 --> 26:53.080
Okay.

26:53.080 --> 26:54.080
Funny stuff.

26:54.080 --> 26:55.080
All right.

26:55.080 --> 26:56.080
Moving on.

26:56.080 --> 26:57.080
What T-shirt are you wearing, Spencer?

26:57.080 --> 27:00.720
Oh, just this Chinese murder van T-shirt.

27:00.720 --> 27:02.220
Whoa.

27:02.220 --> 27:04.440
You guys hear about these Chinese murder vans?

27:04.440 --> 27:06.960
Why don't you stand up and parade it around your finance?

27:06.960 --> 27:08.440
Let me look at you.

27:08.440 --> 27:09.440
Damn dude.

27:09.440 --> 27:10.440
Holy shit.

27:10.440 --> 27:14.440
Why don't you move that bush out of the way so I can look at your tits.

27:14.440 --> 27:15.440
Sorry.

27:15.440 --> 27:20.440
I'm just trying to, I've just spit ball and T-shirt ideas at this point.

27:20.440 --> 27:21.440
I'm really sorry.

27:21.440 --> 27:22.440
You're just a walking T-shirt idea factory.

27:22.440 --> 27:23.440
What, what is that T-shirt?

27:23.440 --> 27:24.440
I wish someone could explain it.

27:24.440 --> 27:25.440
Spencer, you want to hear about these Chinese murder vans?

27:25.440 --> 27:26.440
Speaking of shirts, I'm going to take mine.

27:26.440 --> 27:27.440
Well, now you don't have to.

27:27.440 --> 27:28.440
It's not that.

27:28.440 --> 27:29.440
Because you can own the Chinese murder vans.

27:29.440 --> 27:30.440
I'm sorry.

27:30.440 --> 27:31.440
I'm sorry.

27:31.440 --> 27:32.440
I'm sorry.

27:32.440 --> 27:33.440
I'm sorry.

27:33.440 --> 27:34.440
I'm sorry.

27:34.440 --> 27:35.440
I'm sorry.

27:35.440 --> 27:36.440
I'm sorry.

27:36.440 --> 27:37.440
I'm sorry.

27:37.440 --> 27:38.440
I'm sorry.

27:38.440 --> 27:39.440
I'm sorry.

27:39.440 --> 27:40.440
I'm sorry.

27:40.440 --> 27:41.440
I'm sorry.

27:41.440 --> 27:42.440
I'm sorry.

27:42.440 --> 27:43.440
I'm sorry.

27:43.440 --> 27:44.440
I'm sorry.

27:44.440 --> 27:45.440
I'm sorry.

27:45.440 --> 27:46.440
I'm sorry.

27:46.440 --> 27:47.440
I'm sorry.

27:47.440 --> 27:48.440
I'm sorry.

27:48.440 --> 27:49.440
Because you can own the Chinese murder vans t-shirt.

27:49.440 --> 27:50.440
I'm sorry.

27:50.440 --> 27:51.440
I know.

27:51.440 --> 27:52.440
It's kind of hot up here.

27:52.440 --> 27:53.440
It's hot when you're fat.

27:53.440 --> 27:54.440
How many get one of these Chinese murder vans t-shirts?

27:54.440 --> 27:55.440
Oh, that's simple.

27:55.440 --> 27:56.440
And I want it to be organic.

27:56.440 --> 27:57.440
Yes.

27:57.440 --> 27:59.440
Do you want to be it, it to be made by teepub thousands?

27:59.440 --> 28:01.440
I meant more of the segue.

28:01.440 --> 28:02.440
But sure.

28:02.440 --> 28:04.440
The material should be organic as well.

28:04.440 --> 28:06.440
And how, what are you segwaying to?

28:06.440 --> 28:08.440
And add con��is Strfashioned t-shirts.

28:08.440 --> 28:10.440
And he's a Chinese

28:11.080 --> 28:15.200
What do you what if the what if blue apron made it blew aprons out of micromodal?

28:16.000 --> 28:18.760
Three times softer than cotton now that could be big

28:18.760 --> 28:25.680
What if the what if the aprons vibrated every 40 seconds? What if air B&B offered free me undies for guests?

28:25.680 --> 28:28.960
Did apron come with you to New York apron?

28:30.760 --> 28:34.080
Genius didn't didn't you know bring apron along

28:34.080 --> 28:38.560
Apron seems like somebody that would hang out with Dino

28:39.920 --> 28:44.680
Who is with you and Dino when you guys are traipsing around New York apron, right?

28:45.120 --> 28:47.120
There are people that we run into

28:47.560 --> 28:54.040
But there's no ever Peter blood. Oh, he showed up for a little cameo. Okay, excellent. Do you know his friend Tom?

28:54.040 --> 28:58.120
Met us out. I bought you know a tiny cactus at a tiny cactus store

28:59.560 --> 29:02.660
We he talked to an old fella on the sidewalk

29:02.660 --> 29:07.060
About something. I don't know what they were talking about. I think they're easy conversation

29:07.060 --> 29:08.580
It sounds like a fucked up Jim Croce song

29:08.580 --> 29:12.700
They were talking they were talking about God or something or maybe I'm projecting that because the guy had a yamacan

29:12.700 --> 29:14.700
And he was like very he seemed to kind of

29:17.020 --> 29:23.420
Philosophical okay, but they might have been talking about fucking blue apron. I don't know I'm sure they were

29:23.860 --> 29:25.860
Where they like hey

29:25.860 --> 29:29.940
I don't have the coffee give me the blue apron

29:30.940 --> 29:32.940
What give you a good honey

29:33.940 --> 29:41.740
Thanks, sorry. Sorry everybody. Sorry the show my favorite thing is in the about blue apron ads in particular in podcasting is that

29:41.740 --> 29:43.740
it's because when you listen to

29:44.660 --> 29:51.660
True crime podcast a lot. There's there's very often a very like it's as if they're doing a bit like it's like like like

29:52.100 --> 29:54.100
talking about a horrible murder

29:54.100 --> 30:01.020
What that's something that happens and then there's like no seam going into like having this food delivered to your house

30:01.020 --> 30:06.100
That's kind of funny. That's the best. I love that. It's like when they're like, we're gonna be here all night

30:06.100 --> 30:09.540
So I'm in this case. I should probably get some blue apron. Yeah, well or worse

30:09.580 --> 30:16.540
No, it's you know, it's more like her mangled body had been eaten by her own cats before officers got to the scene and the odor was

30:16.540 --> 30:22.820
Attracting the police. I love a court squash and I cook with my kids all the time and when I do

30:22.820 --> 30:24.660
I

30:24.660 --> 30:26.660
That's so I mean it definitely

30:26.820 --> 30:33.020
With shows like that it seems like you really could sell products because like you're instilling just utter fear

30:33.020 --> 30:37.300
Oh, yeah, I like the kind of thing that makes you not want to leave. Yeah, I mean when you're not leaving your house

30:37.300 --> 30:40.660
You know, you got to have groceries. You know, that's what television is

30:40.780 --> 30:46.420
Television is telling you do not stop watching this television like like, you know, like, you know

30:46.420 --> 30:52.380
Yeah, they go go get a car but but drive it back here and keep watching TV, right? Um, what

30:54.500 --> 30:56.500
Do you think Rob? I

30:56.900 --> 31:02.100
Think I find it. I was thinking about this. I find it strange

31:03.060 --> 31:05.140
That the theme to fall guy

31:06.740 --> 31:12.180
Was more concerned with letting me know that Lee majors was heterosexual

31:12.180 --> 31:17.460
Heterosexual then focused on the stunt work. What's the I just remember he's that

31:18.180 --> 31:22.220
That the kind of kissing tail, but I've taught ladies plenty

31:24.020 --> 31:27.620
I'm just like, yeah, and then you jumped over fire

31:33.660 --> 31:36.940
Okay, but well I've left six feet over a simmering pussy

31:36.940 --> 31:42.460
Yeah, yeah, I'm not the kind of kissing tail, but I'm

31:43.300 --> 31:45.300
Listen, I'm heterosexual

31:45.540 --> 31:48.580
Straight as an arrow. I don't hug my male friends at all

31:50.140 --> 31:55.740
I'm really into pussy. Why does everybody keep asking me if I like it? I

31:56.900 --> 32:02.540
Mean like I mean like really I mean like they lead with that. I'm not the kind of kissing tail

32:02.540 --> 32:07.020
But and then he goes into how many women he's I

32:08.140 --> 32:10.620
Found out Dino told a story. It was really funny

32:12.100 --> 32:19.260
About his dad who's no longer with us. So Lee majors. This will be fine. We're just defining his memory, but but

32:20.380 --> 32:23.580
There they were watching was watching a Woody Allen movie and

32:24.660 --> 32:26.660
And his dad was in the room and then

32:26.660 --> 32:34.140
Did when he Allen had a line about the Greeks inventing homosexuality and Dino's dad got up to

32:34.580 --> 32:36.580
paused the tape and

32:37.100 --> 32:39.540
Lectured Dino about how that's not true

32:40.140 --> 32:47.820
The row the reason that rumor got started is because the Romans made made everyone suck their dicks and then kept the

32:48.180 --> 32:51.580
Replayed the movie and let us let his son just absorb

32:51.580 --> 32:59.020
Is that true? Thanks. How we got it. Yeah, it really it really cleans up with Greek history

32:59.020 --> 33:06.060
Doesn't it like I said, you really cook any shame you went into as a Greek here. You're definitely coming out the other side of that one

33:06.940 --> 33:08.140
renewed

33:08.140 --> 33:10.140
Didn't the Roman steal the Greek

33:11.580 --> 33:12.700
religions

33:12.700 --> 33:19.140
Mythologies and stuff didn't they just like turn Zeus into Jupiter. Yeah, maybe that's me. It's the same thing

33:19.140 --> 33:25.660
Yeah, I like that. It's a New York sort of battle. That's still sort of going on like the group between the Greeks and the Romans

33:26.900 --> 33:33.060
You know, it's real truth is those fucking Romans. There's fucking Romans did this. Yeah, you forget. Yeah, Romans

33:33.060 --> 33:37.340
That's funny to imagine Romans as Italians, which they technically were

33:37.740 --> 33:41.700
But but it's just funny to imagine them in those those outfits, but talking like Robert De Niro

33:41.700 --> 33:48.800
Mark McKinney the the they they they were asking people to do

33:49.540 --> 33:55.180
De Niro impressions in this deadline interview, you know pimping people to do impressions is like kind of like oh boy

33:55.180 --> 33:58.100
What are we how are we gonna get around this and make it funny?

33:59.540 --> 34:01.540
Mark McKinney's impression of De Niro is

34:02.380 --> 34:04.380
They put down that fish

34:04.980 --> 34:07.940
I kept making them do it. Oh all weekend is very funny

34:07.940 --> 34:12.220
I like that it's just like a plaintive whiny non-existent line from some weird

34:15.700 --> 34:20.660
No matter what actor you were if that were the in your catchphrase when people did impressions of you'd be like

34:20.660 --> 34:26.780
I'm gonna do something. I'm gonna be a dentist. I don't want to be an actor anymore. Why did I why did I star in that movie?

34:28.700 --> 34:33.700
We try to figure out the title of the movie wasn't McKinney said don't talk to me with a fish in your hand I

34:33.700 --> 34:39.460
Got a big crush on him as you can tell I like I like to hang out with him. He's very charming

34:41.860 --> 34:43.500
I

34:43.500 --> 34:44.500
Don't

34:44.500 --> 34:47.700
It's not like there's a if you're if you're if you're

34:50.700 --> 34:53.980
You know Bruce McCullough and you're listening I

34:54.860 --> 34:58.940
Didn't I can't remember if I met you, but I didn't dislike you. I'm not saying that

34:59.540 --> 35:01.540
You just saying you have a favorite member now

35:01.540 --> 35:05.420
It's just like I think he you think he might be the most compatible with me

35:07.340 --> 35:10.460
Out of all of them so everybody

35:11.460 --> 35:15.620
I don't know about that. They're all pretty sweet. They're all very sweet. They're all really really really smart

35:15.620 --> 35:17.620
Yeah, but I like him the best

35:20.780 --> 35:24.560
I met a guy I met I think I've met him all I can't now I can't remember if I ever met

35:24.560 --> 35:33.500
Holy I met I met I met Dave Foley. I've met Scott Thompson. I met Kevin McDonald. It was what didn't you yell at Kevin McDonald out of

35:33.500 --> 35:39.980
Your car window or did I I know I I was going to yell at David Cross one time before

35:40.500 --> 35:42.500
We met him like I

35:45.500 --> 35:52.180
Before before we just like moved to Los Angeles and we saw walking down the street and I was I

35:52.180 --> 35:59.060
Said I should roll down the window and yell mr. Show at him and I and I didn't I think I told Dan

35:59.060 --> 36:03.380
I should I was thinking about doing that. I'm glad I didn't because that would have been

36:04.140 --> 36:10.820
David thought that was awesome. He would know now. He would have he would have he would have let you have it

36:11.020 --> 36:14.340
Well, we were moving in a vehicle, right?

36:14.340 --> 36:17.780
Well, I wouldn't have not if he did he would have been saying it up my bumper

36:17.780 --> 36:22.740
Cross it's fast though. There's a one that we don't know about cross. He runs really fast

36:25.740 --> 36:28.300
I met David cross the funny thing is I

36:28.780 --> 36:30.300
it was like

36:30.300 --> 36:35.820
4 a.m. It was a godly like the Sun was up because I remember it was broad daylight, but it was like so

36:36.380 --> 36:40.120
Late it was like there was nobody on the road. I was driving back to

36:40.620 --> 36:46.820
My apartment for probably from some God knows like some who knows a naughty party at an apartment

36:46.820 --> 36:49.540
If it's 4 a.m. Maybe there was coke involved. I don't know

36:49.540 --> 36:52.580
I was I was like probably stayed on someone's couch

36:52.580 --> 36:57.700
so I wasn't too drunk to drive and it was coming home very very wee hours of the morning and

36:58.820 --> 37:05.780
And and at the intersection right over by my house like like it's just this deserted

37:07.140 --> 37:08.380
subdivision

37:08.380 --> 37:09.980
This car

37:09.980 --> 37:14.700
It's coming rolling up to the same stop sign. He's kind of he's kind of rolling the stop sign

37:14.700 --> 37:17.500
He got there way earlier than me, but didn't come to a full stop

37:18.620 --> 37:24.420
Which was fine. I wasn't it wasn't like the person was doing anything really that wrong. It was just

37:25.380 --> 37:27.100
but but it

37:27.100 --> 37:33.660
the car was in the middle of the intersection as I approached it and then it was David Cross and

37:34.020 --> 37:36.020
He looked at my car

37:36.940 --> 37:38.420
coming up to the

37:38.420 --> 37:44.660
Stop sign and he and he took both hands off the wheel of the car and put them both on the on the glass of his

37:44.660 --> 37:51.820
the driver's side of his car and did this like insane like oh my god, I'm gonna die like like

37:52.900 --> 37:57.820
Performance like like as if my car was barreling towards him and he was screaming in in terror

37:57.820 --> 38:01.780
And then he just kept going it was like that was David Cross

38:01.780 --> 38:09.020
Hilarious he just did a bit for me and this is I've never did he oh he never met him and then I met him eventually

38:09.020 --> 38:15.100
I think I probably brought that up and and how did he I can't remember because that's like sorry. I'm sorry

38:15.740 --> 38:19.140
You're sorry. I'm sorry. I can't remember. It gives that's the next question

38:19.140 --> 38:23.100
Well, then you do you meet David Cross? Did you ever tell him that story and what did he say that?

38:23.100 --> 38:27.700
That's obviously a very frustrating thing to not be able to tell you. It's what everybody wants to know

38:27.700 --> 38:32.420
Yeah, everybody everybody wants to know that we were the end where it goes and then we became good friends

38:32.420 --> 38:36.900
Yeah, it's it's it's it's it's it's really irresponsible of me to not have that information

38:37.180 --> 38:41.340
Do you think that he was maybe a little do you think he was coming from the same place you were coming from?

38:41.420 --> 38:44.460
Well, you mean you mean you mean lifestyle wise. I

38:45.580 --> 38:50.740
Probably I mean maybe more I mean it was just that time of the morning like where where Wells would he be?

38:50.740 --> 38:52.740
He's not a milkman

38:52.740 --> 38:54.740
I

38:56.100 --> 38:58.100
Yeah, anyways

38:58.860 --> 39:06.700
Oh, who's the first famous person? Yeah, remember wasn't it David de Covney that we we were in that David de Covney

39:06.980 --> 39:08.980
Did we meet David? I've never met

39:12.820 --> 39:17.780
Yeah, you're right it was okay, it sounded like you were correcting me like his real names Michael de Covney

39:17.780 --> 39:20.660
No, no, I was confirming or affirming your

39:20.660 --> 39:26.420
We were in a sushi restaurant and with our eating like for one of the first times with our our agent

39:27.100 --> 39:29.100
Blair Belcher at UTA and

39:30.340 --> 39:32.340
Rob

39:32.780 --> 39:36.260
David de Covney is behind you

39:36.780 --> 39:39.340
and I and I and I and I and I went

39:39.900 --> 39:42.580
David de Covney and turned around and

39:42.580 --> 39:51.260
And a David de Covney who was quite literally right behind me sitting back-to-back with me in a tiny restaurant

39:51.260 --> 39:57.620
They're like his chair was touching mine. Therefore. He just he heard his name and I so I turned around to see a

39:58.460 --> 39:59.820
confused

39:59.820 --> 40:01.900
David de Covney's nostrils in my face

40:03.260 --> 40:07.660
And then and then I turned back around and focused on anything and our agent Blair

40:07.660 --> 40:13.140
It was like she chuckled and said he got a treat him like ghosts. Oh no the worst

40:14.020 --> 40:19.020
The worst them so he started banging some ceremonial sticks together

40:19.020 --> 40:32.660
Yeah, yeah, I just shrieked him like that

40:33.300 --> 40:36.820
We're supposed to treat mr. De Covney. I'm sorry

40:36.820 --> 40:49.420
Did you make your did you halfway through that? You're like, I better make this Native American chanting so sloppy that it's not offensive

40:49.420 --> 40:52.900
Yeah, yeah, I'm not gonna go. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, I better go

41:04.180 --> 41:09.980
I liked that observation the celebrities are like ghosts they they in LA there because there's millions of them

41:10.580 --> 41:12.580
And they dress funny

41:12.580 --> 41:18.980
Though I here's what I think Rob. I think they're starved for very very casual

41:19.420 --> 41:24.420
Normal conversation that normal people have when they're you know sharing a bus stop

41:24.700 --> 41:28.740
Because people are just like oh, you're the guy from the thing or people are like I'm a big fan

41:28.740 --> 41:35.260
But people aren't just all like fucking the Steelers, right or whatever like I feel like they hate because all their inner

41:35.260 --> 41:42.100
Interactions are just so rarefied and not normal and they must have lived with normal interactions before

41:42.620 --> 41:46.980
Yeah, I think you're doing very more. I think I can answer this as an internet celebrity

41:48.420 --> 41:54.860
It's great when people talk to you and I hate it. I love I love the hits. I'm really into the hits

41:54.860 --> 41:56.860
We talk a lot about the hits branding

41:56.860 --> 42:04.580
So people when you see me feel free to just come up to me randomly and speak about some of my great internet videos

42:06.420 --> 42:11.500
Oh, and you see if you see me tell me about any cool new blue blue apron meals you've had

42:12.060 --> 42:16.900
What's the biggest you fucked up with a celebrity like like I think I think Fred Savage probably I

42:17.340 --> 42:21.380
Fred Savage, but I think I made him hate me in two seconds

42:21.380 --> 42:26.180
Okay, let's hear. Let's hear this. He was he was

42:27.620 --> 42:29.620
He was at a GQ

42:30.980 --> 42:32.980
Gentlemen's quarterly

42:33.100 --> 42:36.500
It was like they have GQ has a party where it's like I

42:37.660 --> 42:42.180
Can't I there's some something in their magazine like the hundred most

42:42.700 --> 42:49.260
What kind of party was it? What kind? What was it? What kind of party? What was what was what was the decorations like?

42:49.260 --> 42:56.100
What were they serving tell the story? It's at a party. I don't need to know you're you the

42:57.180 --> 43:03.180
What's what music were they playing before you story coach was a stupid Rob for relief

43:04.500 --> 43:10.260
All right, just complain about someone telling a story. I was out. Why do you hate me so much?

43:10.420 --> 43:12.020
Why do you hate me?

43:12.020 --> 43:16.940
Just cold cold and callous. It's great people to think that I

43:16.940 --> 43:21.820
Went to the kinds of parties where Fred Savage is just hanging out. It was more of a function

43:21.820 --> 43:26.620
You know, I don't know how good and how great this story is because I want to hear how you fucked over Fred Savage

43:26.620 --> 43:32.900
Oh, I just like I was to I was introduced to him and you know, he's a he's a director. He's a TV director and

43:33.620 --> 43:36.180
It's a you know, and he's his long since

43:37.100 --> 43:43.580
Ben Fred Savage director producer, you know respected by his friends and colleagues

43:43.580 --> 43:47.420
You know not treated like a fucking circus freak

43:48.380 --> 43:50.380
Because you happen to be on a TV show

43:51.020 --> 43:57.860
And I'm a fucking idiot from Milwaukee. So I was he was talking about like he said, oh, he should try the

43:58.580 --> 44:03.620
Shrimp I'm making this up. I said like like some some some some small talk like like like the shrimp

44:03.620 --> 44:05.460
It's just the shrimp

44:05.460 --> 44:11.780
Appetizers are really good and I and I said when you when you're eating the shrimp appetizers

44:11.780 --> 44:18.940
Does does Daniel Stern say that they're delicious in your head Dan and he he looked at me

44:19.820 --> 44:21.020
like

44:21.020 --> 44:23.020
like that

44:25.220 --> 44:27.220
Well, of course you love it, you're not Fred Savage

44:27.700 --> 44:32.980
He he didn't like it, but I don't I also don't want to tell the story in a way that makes him sound like he

44:33.300 --> 44:38.460
Was petty or defensive, you know, I don't think anyway, he looked at me like I farted and was like

44:38.460 --> 44:43.380
You know like wooh, it stinks in here, you know, it's like it's like he just looked at me like like like okay

44:43.380 --> 44:45.460
Well, how do you expect me to you know like he just okay?

44:45.460 --> 44:47.060
Let me ask you a question

44:47.060 --> 44:55.060
Let me ask you let me ask you a question because you're famous and you have fans and you've had fans who have not

44:55.940 --> 45:01.860
Hit it out of the park a couple of times in person. I'd really say the majority and

45:01.860 --> 45:08.660
Have they have they come up to you and said something like oh well any or whatever and and you go

45:08.660 --> 45:15.500
Yeah, or are you every time somebody just reminds you of something you've made your your you're like oh, that's sweet

45:15.500 --> 45:21.300
That's cool. I honestly. Yeah, I know they let the latter. I honestly cannot think I have I had one encounter

45:21.300 --> 45:25.700
I can remember with with a guy that I did not like and

45:25.700 --> 45:32.180
It it was a guy. It was at the um around tour doing the Harmontown thing. It was in Somerville

45:32.820 --> 45:34.220
and

45:34.220 --> 45:37.900
the guy turned out to be he was a drunk guy that had wandered in and

45:38.660 --> 45:40.660
Only knew that I was

45:41.060 --> 45:47.740
Famous didn't know who I was. So it was why the conversation was insulting and novice and and and cloying and like all about him and and

45:48.420 --> 45:49.620
and

45:49.620 --> 45:57.660
But but but so that means that literally I've never really had a bad encounter with a Dan Harmon fan

45:57.660 --> 46:03.540
That's good. People are pretty straightforward. They they they don't they don't they don't there's no bit to do

46:03.540 --> 46:10.500
Yeah, they they say mr. Harmon or or are you Dan Harmon? And then they and then they they're very flat on the streets ahead

46:10.500 --> 46:13.460
You're like, oh, yeah, I certainly wouldn't punish anyone for

46:14.260 --> 46:18.780
really anything because I always think like this is something that you can't control and

46:18.780 --> 46:26.460
That is gonna be gone one day and you're gonna, you know, you suck it up like like like like even the even even if it's like

46:27.260 --> 46:28.820
Not that this has ever really happened

46:28.820 --> 46:35.460
But even if it's not opportune, you know, like but but it's never an inopportune time to approach me because I'm

46:36.100 --> 46:44.860
Not as as I hear celebrities sometimes say ever eating or with people, right? I may look like I am but I'm inside

46:44.860 --> 46:47.860
I'm screaming out. I wonder if anyone recognizes me

46:47.860 --> 46:50.780
And I love hearing the answer is yes, damn, right

46:52.100 --> 46:58.580
It's a great byproduct because it makes me feel like I can delay most of the work that I'm doing in therapy by another 10 years

46:58.580 --> 47:04.540
Because I I'm not a normal person. I'm not perceived that way. So why would I learn to acquire?

47:04.540 --> 47:13.420
And it's also a good indicator of when it's over with yeah, because when they stop doing that, it's it's over with yeah, right?

47:13.420 --> 47:17.980
Yeah, well, oh, wait, is that oh?

47:18.700 --> 47:20.700
He means the career

47:23.140 --> 47:25.140
When are we gonna talk about

47:25.420 --> 47:27.660
What's on the chair? Yeah? Oh my gosh?

47:28.500 --> 47:33.420
That's right. I brought that up. Why'd you buy a case for Dan's iPad that you've been borrowed?

47:33.420 --> 47:40.060
Oh, no, no, no, I if you weren't here the other way I gave back Dan's iPad

47:40.060 --> 47:44.260
Let's run. Oh, I just assumed that was for show. We don't have it and I I

47:45.940 --> 47:47.940
This iPad Pro

47:48.260 --> 47:50.260
Was sent to me

47:50.540 --> 47:57.420
From our own Kevin Day who works on Harmontown and he and he wrote me and he's like hey

47:58.580 --> 48:01.700
Big fan. I heard you were you're down. I

48:01.700 --> 48:10.900
Had an extra one of these iPad pros and a pencil and I thought if this little tiny thing

48:12.780 --> 48:18.960
That I did could just make you just a little bit happier. Wow, I'm gonna do it. Oh come on do it and I was like

48:19.620 --> 48:24.940
Kevin that I'm touched. Thank you so much for doing that. I mean it's strange

48:24.940 --> 48:33.060
But I've I've known this guy maybe a year and a half. Yeah, and yeah, and he lives in he doesn't live in Los

48:33.060 --> 48:35.180
Manila's not like he lives in my neighborhood, right?

48:35.700 --> 48:37.700
He mailed it

48:38.260 --> 48:42.780
Sent it out to me. Well, he must have mailed it from like maybe the next state over or something

48:43.260 --> 48:48.180
Hot. Yeah, I mean had you talked about this with him before no, he's just a he just fan

48:48.180 --> 48:54.340
He hears me on that that you know, I've been depressed. I've lost my way. I don't know if I can go on anymore

48:54.340 --> 48:56.680
I would I just you know, just and I

48:57.540 --> 48:59.540
we had this

48:59.980 --> 49:03.180
Thing with Dan's I there was a miscommunication

49:03.180 --> 49:07.100
Yeah, there's a miscommunication and and and I I bear the brunt of it

49:07.100 --> 49:10.900
But it's it's over with now, but this is a really really nice

49:11.500 --> 49:15.620
Like byproduct of that and I said, you know, you know, Kevin

49:15.620 --> 49:21.700
I was like, you know, you know, you're you're a really good friend now and you're you always you've been I've met you

49:21.700 --> 49:24.420
You're a nice guy and and I did you know

49:25.260 --> 49:32.260
You're a friend and you're not friend. You're not you know responsible for my feelings. You know, it's it's but but thank you for this

49:32.260 --> 49:34.260
And he goes whoa, whoa, whoa

49:34.980 --> 49:38.440
Schrab, what did you just say? I said you're not responsible for my feelings. Whoa

49:39.060 --> 49:41.060
That's not true. Wow. I

49:42.060 --> 49:44.260
Come on care about your feelings

49:45.140 --> 49:49.820
Therefore I take responsibility for you feel it and I was that's huge blown away

49:49.820 --> 49:56.140
It looks like it looks like a legacy iPad like a series one really really really nice

49:56.140 --> 49:59.500
I mean, I don't know. I mean, that's that's technical or whatever right now

49:59.500 --> 50:03.140
Was that just that was just what I was just like drawing some stuff, you know before

50:03.780 --> 50:10.380
You know, I came on here and it's just and it's great because you know, can we take a look at what was it expensive to get that?

50:10.980 --> 50:12.980
iPad then

50:12.980 --> 50:19.000
No, it was a gift. It was it didn't cost you a lot of money. It was a gift. I

50:19.620 --> 50:24.340
Know where you're going with this. I know where you're going with this. Where it's over with. What are you talking about?

50:24.660 --> 50:26.660
What are you talking about?

50:27.580 --> 50:34.100
It's done if we're gonna if you're gonna jump down my throat every time I ask you questions about the nice things you bring to show

50:34.100 --> 50:35.500
Off to our friends

50:35.500 --> 50:37.500
Then then we could do that every time

50:37.500 --> 50:44.360
But I'm just trying to share in your excitement with this fun thing that you got and you know try and

50:44.500 --> 50:47.480
Talk up and try and lower your voice better by your voice

50:47.900 --> 50:49.140
How are you boys?

50:49.140 --> 50:54.740
That's if lower your voice. I'm right here. I can use friends. We don't even always tell each other how they need to talk

50:54.740 --> 50:56.740
You're literally you have a microphone

50:56.740 --> 51:03.260
You just stop shouting at me and I can hear myself really well through the monitors even with this microphone. It's great. Stop shouting

51:03.260 --> 51:12.140
You're embarrassing yourself. Listen, why don't you guys share? You know, this is something I drew. Oh, yeah, that's pretty cool

51:12.140 --> 51:18.100
You like that you show that to the gang. Okay, it might be time for them to read that. Yeah. Yeah, let's take so I drew this

51:18.500 --> 51:20.500
It's pretty cool

51:23.140 --> 51:26.100
There's a lot of you know, like just like different

51:26.100 --> 51:32.660
Different hands that you can use and filters. This is I'm not sure what brush this is

51:32.660 --> 51:38.900
Do you really like it? Do you remember what inspired that? What inspired that? I just you know, I was just like name for that piece

51:38.900 --> 51:40.900
I just like

51:41.620 --> 51:46.500
You know like the name for this. Yeah, universal question

51:47.260 --> 51:54.780
And I understand that that's a metaphor for something real. Isn't that you know, I think it's up to interpretation

51:54.780 --> 51:59.940
You look at it and I want the audience to look at it and just let go. How does this make you feel?

51:59.940 --> 52:04.860
I mean, you know, what is yeah, so I mean, I guess you have yeah

52:04.860 --> 52:11.420
Because that is that is an inspirational if you if you'd like to see Rob's art will upload it to the

52:11.980 --> 52:16.700
Instagram or I can tell you it says why am I not going to Boston in?

52:18.500 --> 52:20.500
Childish

52:20.500 --> 52:22.500
Scrawling now calligraphy

52:22.500 --> 52:24.500
The

52:25.140 --> 52:32.020
Language that Ben Franklin invented if you'd like a low-cost iPad try honey

52:32.020 --> 52:36.980
It's a service that installs a coupon detector on your web browser

52:36.980 --> 52:42.860
Oh, man, you could save so much money within two clicks. You could have a very affordable product. Oh

You bet I think I think you've been pretty good. No, that's why I'm very low-energy and you've you've stepped up

53:24.700 --> 53:28.580

54:07.780 --> 54:11.500
It was either dick Kavett or like not Phil Donahue here the other one

54:11.500 --> 54:13.500
It was a talk show like of that

54:13.500 --> 54:18.980
time but it was it was because Richard prior kept like laughing like he started laughing at

54:19.980 --> 54:25.900
Milton burl who because Milton burl was trying to share he was sharing like some sentiment about

54:26.580 --> 54:35.380
Some about a divorce he had or he asked this woman to have an abortion or something fucking heavy and Richard prior was like

54:36.020 --> 54:38.020
couldn't stop laughing Wow and

54:38.940 --> 54:40.940
Milton burl got pissed off

54:40.940 --> 54:46.900
But it's like dude you you're a comedian. Why are you talking about this heart?

54:47.300 --> 54:49.300
It's crazy. Oh, so cocaine

54:50.100 --> 54:52.100
Also cocaine also cocaine

54:52.620 --> 54:57.820
He was also talking about it's a it's a it's a there are clips of Richard prior where you're like, oh, that feels a little

54:58.660 --> 55:02.380
You know, you're a little less on his side than than on it

55:02.380 --> 55:06.780
But that's that's a clip where you're on Richard prior side because Milton burl is talking about some

55:06.780 --> 55:13.500
Lady in his life that he kind of you know went through and had this horrible impact on it

55:13.500 --> 55:20.500
He's saying he's not it's not he's not he's not he's he's sort of I as I recall that the tone of

55:20.900 --> 55:23.780
What he's saying is it kind of like I

55:24.220 --> 55:29.700
He's kind of patting himself on the back about about about how altruistic he is or something

55:29.700 --> 55:31.700
I can't really it's it

55:31.700 --> 55:37.260
It's it's it would Richard prior starts laughing. It's like you you agree that it's like you think it's but it's got to be

55:37.260 --> 55:39.700
Hard to sit on that couch and and without laughing

55:39.700 --> 55:45.860
It did seem like there was like the old school of comedy and the new school of comedy

55:45.860 --> 55:50.860
just butting heads and the old school was like at that moment going is

55:51.420 --> 55:58.780
It's just fighting to stay on top, but is losing the battle, you know, it's like it's time to time to back off

55:58.780 --> 56:03.460
There's a prior Chevy chase that is like that when they're on the tonight show. Oh, yeah, I saw that one. Yeah

56:03.460 --> 56:10.980
Oh, yeah, your prior is not pleased with Chevy chase and it's sort of like really what yeah, I make more money than you Chevy

56:11.980 --> 56:17.500
What he's really trying to like he's new and he's really trying to be on the good side of people, but he doesn't have it

56:18.220 --> 56:20.220
It's it's interesting. Oh

56:20.620 --> 56:22.620
because you get it was like literally like a

56:23.500 --> 56:26.060
Sort of a frat boy meets a street fighter

56:26.060 --> 56:34.340
We we we just learned or just had it confirmed recently that Richard Pryor also was was fucking and sucking

56:35.620 --> 56:39.460

56:59.420 --> 57:03.180
Brando fucked. I mean, we can't get them on the phone and say is this true

57:03.180 --> 57:06.060
But then Pryor's widow I saw in the

57:06.780 --> 57:13.300
She was like, yeah, well Richard wouldn't even mind me confirming that he was very proud of his bisexuality

57:13.300 --> 57:20.700
I was like, whoa, I just never I never I never heard him referred to like like with that label

57:20.700 --> 57:25.260

57:36.980 --> 57:39.500
He does it's the second album and there's a film

57:39.500 --> 57:45.820
There's actually film footage of him young in like a black sweater and a skull cap and he's saying like a second

57:45.820 --> 57:47.820
Addict doesn't make you gay

57:49.020 --> 57:55.300
He was he had like a big wasn't there was like some kind of gay pride concert where he comes out

57:55.300 --> 58:00.620
It's like the dick is no big deal and they they they turned on him. Yeah, then he walked

I don't know what the details. Do you remember that one? I don't remember

58:03.620 --> 58:08.380

58:08.380 --> 58:10.380
I've seen all sorts of shit

58:10.900 --> 58:12.900

There's a short category of people just like I think this was a little this was unfair

58:36.940 --> 58:41.700
Like to like I'd like to tweak history and and keep them around they could have done us a lot of good

58:41.700 --> 58:45.220

01:00:02.180 --> 01:00:06.460
Oh and on the dance floor like he wasn't it we weren't on the dance floor, but it was like oh

I just had like this moment of clarity of like I was way too drunk to talk to anybody is that's embarrassing

01:00:14.940 --> 01:00:19.060
This is no one saw that I was a little unrelated, but it reminded me of

01:00:20.100 --> 01:00:23.340
When I was in sweet charity in the CB Valley community theater

01:00:23.340 --> 01:00:25.340

20 sided poops and a bitch ain't one

01:00:46.300 --> 01:00:47.340
I

01:00:47.340 --> 01:00:55.620
Got a critical hit. I got a triangular tip. I got three dice. It's like you only got ten sides

01:00:57.580 --> 01:00:59.580
But I

01:01:02.580 --> 01:01:07.460
Audition for that. I yeah, okay. Can we have a little of that? Uh-huh not your idea

01:01:07.460 --> 01:01:14.620

01:02:05.780 --> 01:02:09.740
What if DeMorge walked in and just kept

01:02:10.740 --> 01:02:16.340

01:02:16.340 --> 01:02:19.540
It's a Schrab just made me question

01:02:20.180 --> 01:02:27.100
Reality anyways, I I was in sweet charity and see me valley. I wish I went to the I went to the rap party

Which was it just at someone's house and see me Valley and I

01:02:31.180 --> 01:02:35.220
It wasn't like the G coup. The people were doing karaoke in the living room

01:02:35.220 --> 01:02:41.700
Which was three feet from the house's only bathroom and I went into it and I took the

01:02:42.820 --> 01:02:44.820
worst

01:02:45.100 --> 01:02:47.100
in the history

01:02:48.940 --> 01:02:52.380
Party shit and and like it was

01:02:53.340 --> 01:02:56.700
So it was like it was it was it was

01:02:56.700 --> 01:03:04.260
It's what I had to you know when it was a shit is that gross the irony is you got to take it

01:03:04.380 --> 01:03:09.940
Okay, you can't keep it in okay for the same reason that it was a horrible experience

01:03:10.580 --> 01:03:16.940
Like I just the entire house. Did you walk out or do you walk out of it and go I left

01:03:17.940 --> 01:03:24.660
I destroyed the party and I left because I'm like I'm not gonna hang out here. It smells like fucking shit

01:08:29.940 --> 01:08:34.780
It's a shit to shit. You're gonna feel so much better. Okay, like you are

01:08:36.060 --> 01:08:39.300
To you and you're all right, okay, and you take it

01:08:40.020 --> 01:08:45.580
Nothing happens. Nothing happens. Nothing happens. Nothing happens. Nothing happens party dancing around ghost busters

01:08:49.860 --> 01:08:52.340
Three two one happy

01:08:52.340 --> 01:09:05.380
Yeah, I went to the bathroom and keep in mind

01:09:05.380 --> 01:09:11.900
It's not like the pill goes into your body and then goes down on top of the soft ball size

01:09:11.940 --> 01:09:19.620
Turd that's lodged in your rectum and turns that soft. It's it's it's it what it does do is

01:09:19.620 --> 01:09:26.780
It it it lubricates the muzzle of the gun to the point where the bullet

01:09:27.340 --> 01:09:28.580
comes

01:09:28.580 --> 01:09:30.580
is now fireable and

01:09:30.580 --> 01:09:32.580
I so I I I

01:09:32.900 --> 01:09:34.900
shot a

01:09:35.460 --> 01:09:41.820
Basketball of diamond shit into I think I I think I cracked the ceramic

01:09:42.980 --> 01:09:44.580
I

01:09:44.580 --> 01:09:50.020
It it it it was and then and then and then learned what was happening

01:09:50.700 --> 01:09:57.420
Under that cork. Yeah for the last six hours. Yeah, which was Loch Ness. Yeah, it was

01:09:58.860 --> 01:10:05.140
It was a Kennedy autopsy it was it is crazy that the body will how should we say?

01:10:05.860 --> 01:10:07.860
It will betray you

01:10:08.100 --> 01:10:10.100
Because it will be a cork

01:10:10.100 --> 01:10:16.820
Which is what led to led to this constipation was the cork and then behind the cork is this fine rich wine

01:10:17.620 --> 01:10:19.220
Oh, hi

01:10:19.220 --> 01:10:22.940
And then as soon as you pop the cork you think to yourself. I'm pop cork drink this wine

01:10:22.940 --> 01:10:29.780
It's gonna be such a party. We're gonna drink this wine. Yeah, no you pop the cork and the wine makes you wish you have more cork

01:10:29.780 --> 01:10:32.500
Yeah, yeah, I wanted my cork back. You're a big your

01:10:32.940 --> 01:10:37.660
You're essentially a victim of yourself. Yeah, then you gotta wonder is this thing gonna flush?

01:10:37.660 --> 01:10:40.300
It's like like I don't even know what do I do?

01:10:40.700 --> 01:10:45.500
What if you do what you did at the karaoke party? You just walk you leave the party's walk out

01:10:45.500 --> 01:10:51.340
Let's go. Good luck. Also, you were in a I'm you're in a jumpsuit. Correct. Yeah, exactly

01:10:51.340 --> 01:10:54.380
I got a styrofoam proton pack on and yeah

01:10:57.060 --> 01:11:04.780
Yeah, I was yeah, I guess I was I had my I had sleeves around my knees. Yeah, and and and a proton pack next to it

01:11:04.780 --> 01:11:06.780
Let's go ahead. Let's run that footage

01:11:08.140 --> 01:11:10.940
No, okay, it would be a man

01:11:10.940 --> 01:11:14.940
We really never record the moments that we should from our life

01:11:17.420 --> 01:11:20.740
Well, I'll have like black mirror like like, you know contacts

01:11:20.740 --> 01:11:26.620
They got they're making drones that can fly around and just like be a personal camera now when they get those batteries up

01:11:26.620 --> 01:11:33.460
That'd be crazy. Just have people like, you know live blogging their whole lives from like an autonomous drone that's filming them

01:11:33.460 --> 01:11:37.100
I'd be fucking running with a little insect sized drones

01:11:37.100 --> 01:11:43.940
I think it's like the camera is like a little box and then the quad rotors are just this really thin things that goes out of the box

01:11:43.940 --> 01:11:50.660
That's maybe I don't know. That's how the shit felt quad rotors Brandon. Do you have any celebrity stories?

01:11:51.460 --> 01:11:54.620
Fucking ruin every opportunity to meet a celebrity

01:11:55.420 --> 01:11:57.420
It's why I mostly do animation now

01:11:57.420 --> 01:12:04.380
I'm gonna hide you recorded separate times. I I punked people for the Ashton Kushner and

01:12:05.340 --> 01:12:12.140
That that is Ed involves fucking a lot of people right they probably love that so, you know, that that was that was pretty awful

01:12:14.420 --> 01:12:19.700
What was the punks that you're like, this is gonna go way bad I don't

01:12:20.540 --> 01:12:24.740
What were we thinking was was there anything that went like there was like

01:12:24.740 --> 01:12:29.900
Mackenzie Phillips is like, I'm gonna fucking ruin you. I'm gonna fucking ruin you

01:12:30.740 --> 01:12:34.460
Fucking ruin you these garbage cans are not for sale. Get the fuck out

01:12:35.620 --> 01:12:42.620
Why would you make me think I was pregnant? That's not funny shit. I've been trying for three months

01:12:43.020 --> 01:12:45.620
Mackenzie Phillips. Yeah, once we punk stalker Channing

01:12:45.620 --> 01:12:53.100
Oh, oh, you know, we punked I'm so old. We punked baby. Hey, I

01:12:54.340 --> 01:12:56.340
Can't make it see

01:12:57.020 --> 01:13:02.920
I'm so old one day at a time punks. I punked I punked mini Pearl. I

01:13:03.980 --> 01:13:05.980
Punked the cast of Maude

01:13:07.620 --> 01:13:11.260
On he ha we told Estelle Getty that we had her house keys

01:13:11.260 --> 01:13:16.420
And we did not push Ben Vereen down some soft stairs

01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:20.060
It's okay these stairs are soft look

01:13:22.020 --> 01:13:26.220
Soft it's gonna be okay. I'm gonna shove Ben Vereen down the stairs for a second

01:13:26.220 --> 01:13:30.140
He's gonna think he's gonna break his neck. But when he hits the stairs, I thought the saw

01:13:30.140 --> 01:13:35.020
I thought the prank was that Ben Vereen thought the stairs were soft and then you swap them out for hard stairs

01:13:35.020 --> 01:13:41.820
That's the footage Ben Vereen when somebody said they they're gonna punk you but then when he

01:13:42.300 --> 01:13:46.760
He saw after he saw the footage. Who was 10 speed and brown shoe? That was flip Wilson and

01:13:51.420 --> 01:13:56.940
10 speed and brown shoe Google that shit you fucking millennial cyborgs. Yeah, look it up. No

01:13:57.260 --> 01:14:00.740
Should we are we gonna? I don't know are we I got a slow

01:14:00.740 --> 01:14:07.700
Story, I don't I don't think Spencer's in any shape to D or D. Yeah, I'm fucking blasted

01:14:08.420 --> 01:14:10.340
Although Jeff's gonna be gone for a while

01:14:10.340 --> 01:14:16.820
So that's certainly no reason not to play D&D because he's if we're we're not gonna wait for Jeff to come back to play D&D

01:14:16.820 --> 01:14:20.820
Because that motherfucker is just bailed. Yeah, well, that's the thing is like well

01:14:20.820 --> 01:14:24.020
That's why you can't stop is because we start making balances then

01:14:24.020 --> 01:14:30.460
Only that from there I don't give a fuck. Yeah, it's hard. Just don't accept a promise from Jeff Davis. That's what I

01:14:30.940 --> 01:14:32.940
That's my my motto

01:14:33.300 --> 01:14:37.860
Here, that's all it took huge broken promise. Yeah, that's all it took

01:14:37.940 --> 01:14:43.940
So I pissed off Lin man. Well Miranda. Oh, man shit. Oh man. Well on

01:14:44.900 --> 01:14:50.940
On Twitter, you know, uh, right that that pony tailed prodigy. Damn

01:14:50.940 --> 01:14:58.300
I guess long hair because they're like you like the dude and that's okay. Don't like you I threw away my shot

01:15:00.140 --> 01:15:03.460
Yeah, yeah, but shots fired get him

01:15:03.740 --> 01:15:10.460
What so yeah, no, it's just someone tagged him on on Twitter when I was when I was on Twitter and so he was like

01:15:11.820 --> 01:15:17.260
You like followed me on Twitter really quick and then he saw the thing I said about Hamilton, which was not nice and

01:15:17.260 --> 01:15:20.740
And what did you say? Come on? It's it's not nice

01:15:21.380 --> 01:15:27.140
You can the Hamilton play isn't a nice play. Yeah, I was like this play seems not nice

01:15:27.900 --> 01:15:34.540
See Lin Manuel Miranda. Take things seriously. What did you say? Yeah, let's take these seriously

01:15:34.540 --> 01:15:37.500
No, you're not you're being aggressive and and

01:15:38.300 --> 01:15:45.560
It's not nice and you're shouting again. So stop it. No, don't tell me what to say. Okay. Say nothing

01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:47.560
okay, I

01:15:48.280 --> 01:15:50.280
Got him

01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:53.280
All right, so it wasn't nice

01:15:54.080 --> 01:15:59.880
And it was something that he was upset by presumably so then he followed me and then saw the thing and then he unfollowed me

01:15:59.880 --> 01:16:05.500
And it was like, yeah, you know, it's not as good as a Dan Harmon rap, but I hope someday you'll you'll check it out

01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:11.080
So just totally high-roated and then I just and I got caught in the crossfire and I got fucking shade thrown on my

01:16:11.080 --> 01:16:17.920
Everybody it was a it was a hole. It was a whole mess. Reddiff was was on me. You know, Reddiff

01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:20.640
Unforgettable

01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:27.320
Yeah, it was it was great. And so then not super later after I don't know

01:16:27.320 --> 01:16:32.000
It was it was a good deal after that, but we've we'd never interacted since I've never seen Hamilton. Whatever

01:16:32.760 --> 01:16:36.400
we're doing this live read at the Starburns castle and

01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:38.200
and

01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:40.520
Some some some young

01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:43.680
17 year old punk punk

01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:49.720
Short hair punk comes comes rolling up to our our back door area knocking on the door

01:16:49.720 --> 01:16:56.480
And so I open it up and I I see this young punk and I'm like, oh, hey, are you at the show?

01:16:56.840 --> 01:16:59.680
You know because I'm not gonna just be all like, you know

01:16:59.680 --> 01:17:06.240
Members only because I'm a nice guy, but still the mood was you don't belong here

01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:09.000
You know, even though I was cordial about it and he had a friend with him

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:13.480
And so it's like are these kids think this is the back door or whatever and you know, it turns out Lynn ran

01:17:13.480 --> 01:17:16.000
No, well, Randy doesn't have a ponytail anymore

01:17:17.640 --> 01:17:22.120
And so it's like yeah, and I was like, oh and then and so he's like, yeah, yeah

01:17:22.120 --> 01:17:23.400
And I was like, oh, what's your name?

01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:29.560
And he was like Lynn and so Lynn is a fucking the name any Dan Harmon fan would have just a normal fucking

01:17:29.560 --> 01:17:36.120
Weird weirdo name and I'm like, oh Lynn and then so I kind of slowly and awkwardly back up to let him in

01:17:36.120 --> 01:17:42.880
And then he's with his friend and then and then he can tell that I haven't like I'm still like my guards up

01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:44.280
Or like I don't know what's happening

01:17:44.280 --> 01:17:50.360
I see he he can tell I haven't clocked that it's him right and then and then he holds his hand out to shake me

01:17:50.360 --> 01:17:56.640
And he's shake my hand. He's like you. Yeah, no, he's he grabs me. He shakes me with one arm

01:17:56.640 --> 01:17:59.320
Thank you. My legs are off the floor

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:06.200
And he starts wrapping to the rhythm of the shaking. He throws me away like he wouldn't have done to his shot

01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:11.640
It's the second second Joe reference on the same concept. Anyway, he shakes my hand

01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:15.280
And he's like I'm a huge huge fan and right in that moment

01:18:15.280 --> 01:18:18.840
I'm like he's Lin-Manuel Miranda, and then I'm like and I was like

01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:24.760
Thank you and then like I kind of just turn immediately away like cuz it's just awkward

01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:29.120
and so it's like now this is me not recognizing him and then

01:18:29.840 --> 01:18:36.000
Turning his praise of me into just completely blanking him and not returning any praise or being like oh my god

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:37.800
Thank you so much. It's such a high praise, you know

01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:40.720
And then that's the end of that interaction for the whole night

01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:47.560
And it's just like this guy must think I'm the biggest piece of shit on the planet like the most petty weird aloof guy

01:18:49.560 --> 01:18:52.600
You you were embarrassed you and oh shit

01:18:52.600 --> 01:18:55.000
this is Lin-Manuel and in your

01:18:56.200 --> 01:18:58.520
Embarrassment you did a just a quick turn

01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:05.800
But he didn't know you were embarrassed so he like what probably processed that as oh you said I said something nice about you

01:19:05.800 --> 01:19:11.040
And I was like thanks, and you moved. Yeah, this is like that's that's how I would have processed it

01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:16.640
I like me. I like it. No, it's a great. It's an amazing story, but it's a fucking nightmare

01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:24.200
I mean he's he's truly it's like if I if I like broke mr. Rogers Legger. It's like truly

01:19:24.200 --> 01:19:29.520
There's not a lot of better people that I could have been on the wrong side of never got a chance to go like you know

01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:32.680
Like after the show hey, man when I turned there no no

01:19:32.680 --> 01:19:37.000
I did it at it. I'm really sorry. I was too far and all is unsquashed

01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:43.120
No, if you want unsquashed beef sent to your home blue apron

01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:50.560
Is teaming with Airbnb all this month with honey.com to do beautiful coupons for that reminds me of

01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:54.360
A story about somebody who is is famous

01:19:54.440 --> 01:20:01.160
But I know that I had an exchange was but what was just as awkward as that one I was at

01:20:01.720 --> 01:20:04.520
Gelsons shopping for groceries and

01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:10.560
Tim Heidecker can't this is years ago like right after the Sarah Silverman program got cancelled and

01:20:10.560 --> 01:20:18.140
And I see Tim and at the time at the time like mr. Or not mr. Of like Tim and Eric's awesome show

01:20:18.720 --> 01:20:23.920
Great job was still on the air and I loved it and I still love it and

01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:29.320
Every time I saw Tim and Eric I would go I love your stuff. I'm big fan. I love it

01:20:29.320 --> 01:20:35.400
And so so I see Tim and and I was like this season's been great fucking awesome

01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:43.840
Really cool. Just just such a big fan here such an inspiration. He's like, oh, thanks so much and he leans in and he says

01:20:44.880 --> 01:20:46.880
condolences on the show

01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:49.000
and

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:53.720
Here's and and he's saying condolences on the show because

01:20:54.160 --> 01:20:56.280
Sarah Silverman program just got cancelled

01:20:57.360 --> 01:21:02.000
But I thought when he leaned in and whispered it almost to me because he's

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:05.480
Hip comedian Tim Heidecker. I thought he said

01:21:06.640 --> 01:21:12.760
After I said, I love the show. I love the show and he leans in a I thought he said Ken Dolan's is on the show

01:21:14.520 --> 01:21:16.520
And I'm like

01:21:17.360 --> 01:21:23.040
Holy shit, who's Ken Dolan's sounds familiar. I should it's one of the monkeys

01:21:23.040 --> 01:21:27.920
I did yeah, I just I should probably know that I don't want Tim to think I'm

01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:32.040
I'm square so I'm just going to be positive about it

01:21:32.040 --> 01:21:36.560
I mean, it's a man so famous that that you have to lower your voice

01:21:36.560 --> 01:21:41.880
Yeah, yeah, don't don't don't let this week, but we locked Ken Dolan

01:21:42.680 --> 01:21:46.720
and and so he he's he's leaning in saying

01:21:47.400 --> 01:21:49.400
Condolences on your show. It's got to suck

01:21:50.680 --> 01:21:54.400
Huge and I'm thinking holy shit. I don't want to think like a square

01:21:54.400 --> 01:21:59.640
So I'm going to spin this positive and I go cool with a thumbs up

01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:07.640
That's so and and so he Lee so he from his point of view you guys a condolences on your show

01:22:07.880 --> 01:22:11.360
You know being kids, so it's got to suck and I go cool

01:22:12.640 --> 01:22:15.720
and he looked at me like anybody would and

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:22.680
Walked away, you know, and it wasn't until I was halfway home driving in the car and I went

01:22:22.680 --> 01:22:25.880
Can Dolan's is on the show fuck

01:22:27.120 --> 01:22:31.920
And I have never had a chance to I should have called him up. I should have drove to his house

I said I thought you said Ken Dolan's you're like outside his shower

01:22:35.240 --> 01:22:37.240
I thought you said Ken Dolan's

01:22:38.360 --> 01:22:43.360
And then he would have went so if I did say Ken Dolan's and you didn't know who it was

01:22:43.360 --> 01:22:49.000
You would have pretended like you did so you thought you were cool. That's reasonable

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.640

Don't hit me work on it. That's a horrible thing that you think like if a sentient thing was saying

Stop hitting me that that would want you make you want to hit it more

01:25:12.880 --> 01:25:15.280
Yeah, and what if you bleed also and cry?

01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:19.600
Holy shit, like if sheep could scream. Yeah when you kill them

01:25:20.120 --> 01:25:23.680
And they had an idea that you were making sweaters and they were just like

No, we could that could do it. Do we do we want to we do we I'm down to do it

01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:34.400
I just wanted to tell that story that I had earlier. That's the only reason

01:25:34.400 --> 01:25:38.880
That's a crazy story. I know it's a crap. It doesn't come up. I do want you to I honestly have to say

01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:41.840
I do want you to stand strong on the way you feel about

01:25:42.520 --> 01:25:43.640
Hamilton

01:25:43.640 --> 01:25:49.920
Because I do think that even Lin Manuel understands how you feel. He's he's a you know

01:25:49.920 --> 01:25:54.240
He's a fan of rap, but I also think he understands that what he's doing is sanitized wrap

01:25:54.240 --> 01:25:57.600
But that's very clever. Very awesome. Did you see my tweets?

01:26:00.320 --> 01:26:02.320
Not

01:26:03.840 --> 01:26:05.840
No, I don't want to talk. I don't

01:26:10.120 --> 01:26:12.120
More like crappleton

01:26:12.120 --> 01:26:19.560
Why didn't someone give this guy a manual I said how to rap better. I said

01:26:20.680 --> 01:26:26.520
See because this is some crap music. I'm listening to and it just says rap

01:26:27.120 --> 01:26:29.520
So I think you might have left to see somewhere

01:26:30.400 --> 01:26:35.640
Often off the word pretty good. Welcome to our wool. Notice. There's no P in it. Let's keep it that way

01:26:35.640 --> 01:26:40.520
I don't know if that was a warning to him just from your experiences a camp counselor

01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:44.440
I'm sure he was surprised because when you look at you you go. Well, this guy loves rap

01:26:44.440 --> 01:26:51.360
This guy is a big rap fanatic motherfucker. It looks like oh boy. What are you looking about look like I'm action Bronson over here

01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:55.360

01:26:56.200 --> 01:27:00.520

I mean, I'm sure people like it

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:26.560
I just the rap seemed to be off meter and it's like there you go wraps

01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:29.280
It needs to be like the meter is all there is in rap

01:27:29.280 --> 01:27:35.840
And so if you're like I have a banana and my friends from Panama, then it's like well, that doesn't really I mean sure

What did I do a shot some

01:31:25.440 --> 01:31:27.840
Person was that that thing you were talking about?

01:31:28.520 --> 01:31:33.760
No, all that was like the week before okay, but it's a bunch of stuff that we before but then today my friends

01:31:33.960 --> 01:31:39.960
Kyle duck and Graham and Molly Evan had a crab boil a crawfish boil. Yeah, just mountains

01:31:39.960 --> 01:31:43.160
I was at one of those recently. Oh, just corn is so violent

01:31:45.680 --> 01:31:52.080
The eating dismembering crabs. I just like I just like I went to one a couple weeks ago with my buddy Scott and

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:56.880
Shellfish. Yeah, they're crawling. Yeah, they all get shipped in life. No, I know what they're

01:31:57.120 --> 01:31:59.880
Yeah, they have to be alive. I'm just saying shellfish

01:32:01.040 --> 01:32:07.600
Yeah, but when you see the devastation, okay, it's cool, you know, like they're all alive in a bag

01:32:07.600 --> 01:32:15.120
I cut open the bag. They put it then they dump all these living creatures in a strainer. Look, I know I but I'm witnessing it

01:32:15.120 --> 01:32:21.200
Okay, that's why I mean, I know I know what you know. Oh, no, no, you're on my team. I

01:32:21.720 --> 01:32:26.000
Thank you. Yeah, you're honest. I hear Spencer and Dan

01:32:26.840 --> 01:32:31.200
But anyway, they're all trying to they're all like freaking out. They're trying to get out climb out of this thing

01:32:31.200 --> 01:32:34.640
Why do you think they're trying to get out? They don't want to be on top of each other? I mean, why?

01:32:34.640 --> 01:32:38.680
Why do you think they're trying to get out? I don't know Rob? I don't know

01:32:40.680 --> 01:32:43.180
Is it because they can't wait for Cajun season and spice it?

01:32:46.200 --> 01:32:49.920
There's like a hundred of them in there all moving around but it's like bodies

01:32:49.920 --> 01:33:07.920
Stacked up and then they get put in a pot of boiling water. Yeah, and then they get covered and then 10 minutes

01:33:08.080 --> 01:33:12.000
They didn't feel anything they didn't feel anything 10 minutes later

01:33:12.120 --> 01:33:19.280
They take the the strainer out and then they just dump like a hundred corpses on this table

01:33:19.280 --> 01:33:23.280
Yeah, there's all these yeah, all these people slow down

01:33:27.120 --> 01:33:31.280
They pull them in half, and then they eat what looks like the inside

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:36.480
The diet the baby's not the shit tract. It's like brown. It looks like it's like

01:33:37.760 --> 01:33:41.280
Vonnegut would describe a picnic at Roy Rogers. Yeah

01:33:42.320 --> 01:33:44.320
And then at the end you look at the devastation

01:33:44.320 --> 01:33:50.400
It's like it's like less than an inch of meat in that thing and I can't imagine it didn't smell good and then it's just like

01:33:51.200 --> 01:33:53.200
hundreds of corpses on this table

01:33:53.760 --> 01:33:58.320
I mean at the at the at the crab boil. Are you there saying this? Yeah, because I'm like god

01:33:58.320 --> 01:34:04.480
Silent green. There's a lot of it's a lot of death. Yeah, buddy. It's a kind of isms inherently. Stop it

01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:09.440
Stop it. Yeah, I have a good time and it tastes good. No, they were like

01:34:09.440 --> 01:34:13.440
It tastes good

01:34:14.960 --> 01:34:21.440
Stop being such a bummer steve. Yeah, I think it tastes good. I was just like

01:34:22.640 --> 01:34:27.440
Geez, you know, I'm so unlikable. I'm doing nothing for my gosh. Yeah, it's an important

01:34:27.440 --> 01:34:32.960
Yeah, it's an important time. It's good. You're just being yourself and that's it. I tried not to say anything

01:34:33.360 --> 01:34:36.960
No, no, no, it's a ridiculous thing that we still do that because it's not a lot of meat

01:34:36.960 --> 01:34:42.000
It's things with a lot of meat. Maybe it's not a shrimp a shrimp. The whole thing is a is the meat

01:34:45.920 --> 01:34:52.880
It's just birthday. Yeah, let him eat crabs. Oh, no. No. Yeah, I'm sorry. Sorry. No, it was a fun party

01:34:52.960 --> 01:34:54.960
It's a fun party. I don't know why I'm looking at you when I said

01:34:55.120 --> 01:34:57.120
Because you know we know

01:34:58.320 --> 01:35:00.720
Huh? Waffle House? Waffle House?

01:35:00.720 --> 01:35:17.600
Yeah, well on top of on top of you guys being black gentlemen, like we're listening to the one Jewish guy is like telling us that shellfish are gross

01:35:18.160 --> 01:35:20.160
You knew you felt that way. I mean

01:35:21.280 --> 01:35:23.280
It wasn't shellfish. It was like

01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:27.280
Like I had seen pictures of Jews piled up like that before

01:35:27.280 --> 01:35:31.040
Whoa. Oh god. Jesus in hand. I have two. Yeah

01:35:31.680 --> 01:35:34.880
Fuck me up, man. I think the Nazis were going. What do you taste?

01:35:38.320 --> 01:35:46.240
It's worth it. It tastes good. That's a good point Rob. The Nazis were more moral than people who eat shellfish

01:35:47.040 --> 01:35:48.480
Wow, bro

01:35:48.480 --> 01:35:51.920
More moral the Holocaust was basically a clam bake

01:35:51.920 --> 01:36:00.080
Is what you're saying. Well, I'm sure the Nazis had to to think that the Jews were animals in order to

01:36:00.560 --> 01:36:05.040
Do horrible things to them, right? Or did they thought they were humans and equals?

01:36:06.160 --> 01:36:08.000
No, they had to turn them

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:13.680
Mentally, they had to process that they were less than them in order to do horrible things to them

01:36:13.680 --> 01:36:21.280
Well, I'm never gonna I'm never gonna tell you that you should you shouldn't be vegetarian and invest in I will

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
Stop it knock it off

01:36:24.320 --> 01:36:26.320
But they weekend

Yeah, DJ moist playing the best hip hop new jack swing and did you guys have the back room?

01:36:51.760 --> 01:36:57.440
Yeah, we had the whole back room the best part was the main Friday night's a big dance night in that bar the little joy

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:04.480
And uh, the main DJ was was there doing whatever he wanted. Yeah, he's playing like world me like brazil and brazil beat

01:37:05.680 --> 01:37:06.960
of course

01:37:06.960 --> 01:37:08.800
and uh

01:37:08.800 --> 01:37:12.800
Everybody that was coming in was going what's going on in there and we're just coming into the room the little room for the party

01:37:12.800 --> 01:37:14.800
So we were stacked up the people on the

01:37:15.440 --> 01:37:20.400
Uh, I missed it at some point the DJ the main DJ is just in our party just standing around with his arms crossed going

01:37:20.800 --> 01:37:25.360
Why is this and when I went out to talk to him? There was nobody in the front room. Everybody was just in awesome

01:37:25.680 --> 01:37:31.120
So it's good. You want to hear you want to hear what I hear in my head when I hear new jack swing as a genre

01:37:31.280 --> 01:37:33.280
Like what it sounds like. Oh, I'm sure yeah

01:37:33.280 --> 01:37:41.200
Yes, I got my baby on a fire escape. We're gonna make love to her tonight. I got a two panties in a bucket of dreams for me

01:37:45.040 --> 01:37:48.000
I didn't really add enough new jack to that but also it wasn't swing

01:37:48.640 --> 01:37:52.240
So I did a little swing. Yeah, uh swing and a miss across the board

01:37:54.400 --> 01:37:56.400
All right, well happy birthday

01:37:56.480 --> 01:38:01.920
I'm trying to think of like wordplay to do with your name and uh birthday or like like are you gonna turn demore?

01:38:01.920 --> 01:38:05.680
Demore, I'm sorry. I bummed you out on your on your birthday. I mean

01:38:06.720 --> 01:38:09.840
I don't know. I don't know how when how did

01:38:11.360 --> 01:38:15.840
I mean it's so easy for people to protest something like guns or or like political stuff

01:38:15.920 --> 01:38:21.520
But I don't know how to do it. Yeah, and I I'm making it. I thought you made a salient point

01:38:23.520 --> 01:38:26.000
But but there's it it just makes the people

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:33.360
They'll dig in more with what they want to do instead of maybe if they're maybe if they're 30 or maybe if they're they they don't

01:38:33.440 --> 01:38:35.440
I mean, I think we're all

01:38:36.320 --> 01:38:38.240
reasonably mature

01:38:38.240 --> 01:38:40.240
if not

01:38:40.400 --> 01:38:46.240
Aging decrepit world weary men that that are perfectly willing to have you know what it is

01:38:46.400 --> 01:38:48.720
It's guilt for living a certain way

01:38:49.920 --> 01:38:53.840
And then and waking up and going. Oh my god. What have I been doing?

01:38:53.840 --> 01:38:59.840
If we didn't have friends that uh that that went there we wouldn't I mean part of the part of the

01:39:00.560 --> 01:39:01.760
very

01:39:01.760 --> 01:39:03.760
profound crime of

01:39:04.320 --> 01:39:06.320
carnivorous

01:39:06.320 --> 01:39:12.960
Lifestyle is that it's truly mainstream to the point where no one ever has to talk about it. So much as like

01:39:13.520 --> 01:39:19.680
Gay rights or anything that's it's like like like like there's the the oppression is sounds like silence

01:39:19.680 --> 01:39:24.160
You know like like no one talking about it at all. So what are you supposed to do except say stuff?

01:39:24.480 --> 01:39:29.120
And yeah, it's a it's a it's a it's a not it's an unenviable position to be the person

01:39:29.520 --> 01:39:34.640
That brings it up because the incentive would be to not do that because oh, I want people to like me

01:39:34.640 --> 01:39:36.560
Which is like saying it tastes good

01:39:36.560 --> 01:39:38.160
You know we try to strike a balance

01:39:38.160 --> 01:39:44.560
I think I think I like that I have a friend who represents that view and I I perceive myself as hovering around that

01:39:44.560 --> 01:39:50.240
You know Kevin Smith told me he he went vegetarian because he or vegan because he just had his heart attack and

01:39:50.800 --> 01:39:56.000
You know it and everybody's like all mad at him. You know like like like that's like some kind of

01:39:56.560 --> 01:39:58.560
lifestyle

01:39:58.800 --> 01:40:01.360
Something like it's just like I what I can't eat meat for

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:05.520
One years and then have a heart attack and then stop I used to do that too

01:40:05.520 --> 01:40:08.080
I used to love Korean barbecue and I remember I

01:40:08.480 --> 01:40:14.000
Are our good friend Kelsey Abbott is vegetarian. I said hey, we're gonna go do Korean barbecue

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:17.840
It's it's great. You know come along because you're fun and it's always fun

01:40:17.920 --> 01:40:22.560
And I'd like you to and she said Koreans are human beings. You know they it's not really

01:40:23.680 --> 01:40:25.680
But but she was like

01:40:25.920 --> 01:40:28.640
I don't really you know, she was trying to be cool about it and I went

01:40:28.880 --> 01:40:35.200
Oh god, and I made her feel bad about it and I now I yeah because you felt bad because and that's that's why it's important

01:40:35.200 --> 01:40:38.000
To to speak out. I don't know that's a corny phrase speak up

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:45.440
But it's it's the reason the reason why it's good and healthy for you to say stuff is the same reason why people might like

01:40:46.080 --> 01:40:51.760
Smack you down when I was a smoker same thing smoker culture somebody says you should quit smoking

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.480
You know we make fun of the non-smokers telling it trying to help us

01:40:55.040 --> 01:40:59.920
Because we I don't know always we're drawn to these cigarettes as a part of a religion that we're like yeah

01:40:59.920 --> 01:41:04.800
Go fuck yourself my drinking. I don't like I don't like uh, I don't like people being sanctimonious and telling me

01:41:04.800 --> 01:41:11.840
But you know if I was truly confident and blah blah blah like I should I should let it just be part of my world

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:17.760
If I know that I love drinking and I and I know why or whatever and I don't have a single inkling of

01:41:18.160 --> 01:41:21.600
Like oh, maybe I should quit drinking then I wouldn't upset me when a 16 year old

01:41:22.320 --> 01:41:26.480
twit, um, that whose life is untested and who has never tasted real pain

01:41:26.880 --> 01:41:32.320
Um, uh, uh, you know every time I self effacingly comment on my trademark

01:41:32.320 --> 01:41:34.320
Uh, boozing, you know

01:41:34.640 --> 01:41:36.160
humorlessly

01:41:36.160 --> 01:41:41.760
Suggests that I that I'm an unhappy person or blah blah blah. I'm like no you're a transparently

01:41:42.560 --> 01:41:46.000
Joyless little fucking mongrel like like you're you're you're a broke

01:41:46.720 --> 01:41:47.760

Judgmental little shit face and you're talking to a middle-aged millionaire. I am I allowed to self abuse

01:41:55.200 --> 01:41:57.840
Uh, I'm I'm 30 years ahead of you

01:41:57.840 --> 01:42:05.840
Uh, uh, I'll figure it out. I'm probably gonna like learn more shit before you because I'm old. I'm dying

01:42:06.400 --> 01:42:09.760
Uh, this is what he says to his foster kid tend your own garden

Like go go just go do some ketamine and eat my balls. All right, so I'm sorry

01:42:23.440 --> 01:42:27.760
Anyways, but uh, yeah, I mean I was like like maybe I should stop eating meat and I think about that all the time

01:42:27.760 --> 01:42:33.200
But I don't yeah, yeah part of being an advocate is uh taking shit for being an advocate. So uh, you're doing great

01:42:33.840 --> 01:42:39.040
That's the best part. So people need to be anti-demorges happiness on his birthday. It's it's important

01:42:39.040 --> 01:42:43.600
I mean, he's part of a system of oppression. He's like, oh my birthday. I want to be happy a presser

01:42:45.280 --> 01:42:48.560

You gonna take a stand and you took a stand

01:42:50.880 --> 01:42:55.120
I feel good about that. I'm against happiness. Someone needs to say it

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
You're against happiness. Yeah

01:43:00.160 --> 01:43:02.160
Down with joy

01:43:02.480 --> 01:43:06.480
Uh, no, uh, we're closing in on this episode. We got about 10 minutes

01:43:07.600 --> 01:43:09.600
I just want to see how you want to spend it

01:43:10.480 --> 01:43:11.680
No segue

01:43:11.680 --> 01:43:17.440
I keep saying like we should we should shorten the episodes by like five minutes a week until they're like 90 minutes

01:43:17.440 --> 01:43:21.040
And then like because why does he do what would anyone want to listen to this for two hours?

01:43:21.120 --> 01:43:28.160

01:43:29.120 --> 01:43:31.120

That's a year. That's a that's a

01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:38.880
Well, he probably could go to boston. It would be boston and then long island the next day

01:43:38.960 --> 01:43:41.680
I mean most adults are free to travel around the country, right?

01:43:42.240 --> 01:43:46.000
Yeah, that's do you have your guests lined up already for boston and

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:50.160
We are the secrets. We usually don't do guests on the road. Not usually, right?

01:43:50.240 --> 01:43:55.600
Yeah, sometimes the second island finac has my truck by yeah, no, I'm kidding. I say yeah, you could find tickets for that

01:43:59.600 --> 01:44:01.600
The wilbur theater

I hear we're almost sold out almost get them over a thousand seats. Well, that's real good news

01:44:09.600 --> 01:44:11.600
There it is

01:44:14.560 --> 01:44:15.920
Also

01:44:15.920 --> 01:44:17.120
Long island

01:44:17.120 --> 01:44:21.920
Uh, another big announcement. Uh, uh, we're very close to closing

01:44:22.640 --> 01:44:23.920
a deal

01:44:23.920 --> 01:44:27.360
Where we will have an audience again June 4th

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:29.040
also

01:44:29.040 --> 01:44:34.000
If I mean don't don't know if you care without announcing this but we're switching nights

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:42.000
Oh, we're probably switching nights to saturdays switching nights to monday monday night when the action is hot

01:44:42.560 --> 01:44:47.040
You go to work after sunday. You're miserable and monday night

01:44:47.840 --> 01:44:54.560
It's tuesday eve ready to action ready to party monday night. The m is for marvelous

01:44:58.240 --> 01:45:00.240
Um, what's the end stand for?

01:45:00.240 --> 01:45:03.840
Um, night nutsauce blue apron nutsauce

01:45:05.040 --> 01:45:09.040
What uh, what we we used to be on monday's right or was it tuesdays?

01:45:09.680 --> 01:45:12.000
It was monday's back in the day and then we went sunday in our

01:45:12.720 --> 01:45:17.120
Somebody told me I mean we could always we would always have the option of like like well, maybe not at this new place

01:45:17.280 --> 01:45:24.000
But like, uh, obviously here, uh, we could be here anytime we wanted we could be here at 3 a.m. on friday

01:45:24.320 --> 01:45:26.320
Uh, well, we pre-record these

01:45:26.320 --> 01:45:34.320
In it, but but somebody told me that saturdays and fridays are like bad nights for comedy in terms of live audiences

01:45:34.800 --> 01:45:39.200
Saturdays are great fridays are rough. Okay. Why because of because people are tired

01:45:39.200 --> 01:45:46.000
So you the the myth is friday second show is the worst show you'll do all the all week because because who's tired

01:45:46.160 --> 01:45:48.160
It's friday night because it's tired of work

01:45:48.400 --> 01:45:53.600
Yeah, that's why the groundlings the groundlings second show is always either either cooking with gas or the new shows

01:45:53.600 --> 01:45:58.480
That the new sketches are trying out and then they yeah, and even at every comedy show in the city

01:45:58.480 --> 01:46:02.400
It's going to be like fucking friday second shows the worst. They're really drunk by then

01:46:03.120 --> 01:46:04.240
Usually too

01:46:04.240 --> 01:46:07.520
So if you jump in your car and you come straight to the comedy show great

01:46:07.920 --> 01:46:12.080
But if you are at home pre-partying and then you show up at the comedy show you're like fuck this place

01:46:12.720 --> 01:46:16.000
Both shows saturday are wonderful because people put it in their plans. They know they're doing it

01:46:16.400 --> 01:46:22.000
Yeah, and they sleep in and then they saturday is okay. I get it. But anyways monday nights

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:28.080
Oh, come on hottest night of the week. You've had two days to get rested. Are you still fucked up?

01:46:28.800 --> 01:46:34.720
Come see us monday nights breakfast. You had your lunch. You had your dinner

01:46:36.160 --> 01:46:40.160
You've had all day to like re-engage your career

01:46:40.880 --> 01:46:46.080
You can also tell like I don't want to do shit this week by monday. So go out monday night and prove it

01:46:47.520 --> 01:46:51.360
Uh, so anyways, yeah, we're gonna be we will have audiences back and all this stuff

01:46:51.360 --> 01:46:55.280
Like like again, how do they get sick? Look, I know I I'm sorry anybody ever

01:46:55.680 --> 01:47:02.560
It mistook me for thinking that there was a better idea to not have an audience that was never I didn't I never thought that that made the show better

01:47:02.720 --> 01:47:05.120
I I think what I may have who told who says

01:47:05.760 --> 01:47:09.840
I don't know. Is that like Jeff like I told a bunch of people that I mean, okay

01:47:09.920 --> 01:47:17.120
Like I don't know if you've been languishing in silence going like oh dan thinks this is a great idea to not be in front of an audience

01:47:17.280 --> 01:47:20.640
Not really. No, I don't really think I think it's a good experiment because

01:47:20.640 --> 01:47:26.160
I found it beneficial to me. I enjoyed it. Yeah, I found the good in it

01:47:26.240 --> 01:47:30.880
And now you it's run its course and you're ready to go back. I bet you're gonna be a better person

01:47:30.880 --> 01:47:36.080
I'm gonna be like a fucking LeBron. Oh, that's gonna be great. You could be like a little LeBron

01:47:37.360 --> 01:47:39.360
The famous athlete LeBron

01:47:40.960 --> 01:47:44.800
