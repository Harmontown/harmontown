{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:12.000\nLet's bring out, we don't have a spender, but don't think of it as losing a spender.\n\n00:12.000 --> 00:24.000\nThink of it as gaining a Brandon Johnson, everybody.\n\n00:24.000 --> 00:31.000\nWhat up Brandon? Thank you so much for having me tonight, Jeff Davis. You looking good. You looking great. Thank you.\n\n00:31.000 --> 00:36.000\nWhy don't we bring out the mayor of Harmontown? Dan Harmon.\n\n00:36.000 --> 01:05.000\nI had one note. I got mad because I'm recreationally house hunting.\n\n01:05.000 --> 01:12.000\nThis will be a sympathetic bit. People will love this.\n\n01:12.000 --> 01:17.000\nI'm just looking around for houses and I don't like it.\n\n01:17.000 --> 01:30.000\nI just went to a house and they're like, hey, welcome to the open house and like you can either take off your shoes or you can put on these special surgical shoes like you're Mark Wahlberg about to shoot like somebody in the department.\n\n01:30.000 --> 01:42.000\nI'm never buying your house. Fuck you. Take off my shoes. Is it a house or not? A house is a giant shoe. A house is a shoe for your life.\n\n01:42.000 --> 01:46.000\nIf you buy the house, you get to decide who wears a shoe and who doesn't wear the shoe.\n\n01:46.000 --> 01:53.000\nYeah, but this is bad mojo. How much sage can you burn to get rid of the fucking foot of phobe that lives there?\n\n01:53.000 --> 01:59.000\nDo you want to buy a house where they didn't give a fuck about people with their gross feet all over the place?\n\n01:59.000 --> 02:03.000\nIn a word? Yeah. I guess I don't want that mojo.\n\n02:03.000 --> 02:10.000\nThat to me says that welcome to the house. Maybe you'd like to buy it. Take off your shoes or put on special booties.\n\n02:10.000 --> 02:19.000\nThat to me says we hit all the bodies in the attic. There's just extra special attention put into dishonesty.\n\n02:19.000 --> 02:21.000\nLook, we're not getting off on the right foot.\n\n02:21.000 --> 02:29.000\nNo, no, no. You are because I'm going to tell you if I come to your house and I'm trying to, you know, let's say you have a used Bentley, right? And it's $150,000. You pay $200,000 for it, right?\n\n02:29.000 --> 02:33.000\nIf I want to sit in that motherfucker with some mud on my feet, I'm about to spend $150,000.\n\n02:33.000 --> 02:34.000\nRight.\n\n02:34.000 --> 02:40.000\nSo if you're about to buy a house, yeah, you might want to walk up in that. You might say, I don't even know if this shit's comfortable unless I got mud on my feet.\n\n02:40.000 --> 02:43.000\nRight. I think you're picking up what I'm laying down.\n\n02:43.000 --> 02:44.000\nYeah.\n\n02:44.000 --> 02:47.000\nIf I'm buying some shit, I should be able to use it as I would use it.\n\n02:47.000 --> 02:52.000\nYeah. You want me to live in this shit or you want me to, or you want it to be less dirty for the next person that might live in it.\n\n02:52.000 --> 02:53.000\nFuck you.\n\n02:53.000 --> 02:57.000\nI made a mud. I'm going to live in your house.\n\n02:57.000 --> 02:59.000\nFucking Dan Harmon.\n\n02:59.000 --> 03:04.000\nNever asked me to take my shoes off. It's going to make your house more dirty, by the way.\n\n03:04.000 --> 03:09.000\nYou think my shoes are fucked up? You should see my socks.\n\n03:09.000 --> 03:12.000\nYou know what? You deserve it. There comes my shoes off.\n\n03:12.000 --> 03:16.000\nAll right. Anyways, let's get things on a more, you know, I want to win the audience.\n\n03:16.000 --> 03:20.000\nYou know, I want to win the audience back. I feel bad for Liam Neeson.\n\n03:20.000 --> 03:23.000\nThat's a great way to win the audience back.\n\n03:23.000 --> 03:25.000\nWhat are you? My jokes agent?\n\n03:25.000 --> 03:28.000\nYes.\n\n03:28.000 --> 03:30.000\nI get 10% of your laughter.\n\n03:30.000 --> 03:35.000\nIf you represent the joke, you're like making calls. Listen, there's a joke over here.\n\n03:35.000 --> 03:40.000\nWhat was his angle? What was he trying to do? He was coming clean about the fact that he went...\n\n03:40.000 --> 03:42.000\nBlack bastard.\n\n03:42.000 --> 03:48.000\nHe was... I think... Part of me is like, I won't click on any of this shit because it feels...\n\n03:48.000 --> 03:52.000\nIt's like my general sort of like, the internet's awful and all this stuff.\n\n03:52.000 --> 03:57.000\nBut as far as... But I also don't think it's one of those stories where like, ooh, you got to do your research.\n\n03:57.000 --> 04:00.000\nI believe that he was probably doing an interview.\n\n04:00.000 --> 04:07.000\nI think he kind of like... I've done a lot of interviews and when you're on a roll,\n\n04:07.000 --> 04:11.000\nmaybe you've taken an extra milligram of Adderall and maybe you're at Comic-Con\n\n04:11.000 --> 04:17.000\nand you're like, someone's like pumping you up and being like, yeah, but seriously, why is Rick and Morty so genius?\n\n04:17.000 --> 04:21.000\nAnd you're like, this person, I can't do no wrong. Like, I want to try to explain myself.\n\n04:21.000 --> 04:29.000\nAnd like, I think he probably... He sidled into a confession about how crazy he was 40 years ago.\n\n04:29.000 --> 04:37.000\n40 years ago, and this is all of our mistake, is twice the median age of the people that control the planet.\n\n04:37.000 --> 04:41.000\nSo none of them are ever going to go, oh, well, I get it.\n\n04:41.000 --> 04:45.000\nThis is my realization. This is both my terror and my resignation.\n\n04:45.000 --> 04:52.000\nIt's like, if you lived your life on the internet as I have, you are now...\n\n04:52.000 --> 05:02.000\nYou have laid down a paper trail, like a landscape of you being a terrible person from the age of zero to 46.\n\n05:02.000 --> 05:08.000\nNow, today's 10-year-old who's born on the internet, and I say this out of sympathy to today's children,\n\n05:08.000 --> 05:14.000\nbecause they have to have 35 Instagram accounts so that their parents can't watch them go through puberty.\n\n05:14.000 --> 05:18.000\nI can't imagine what it's like to be 20 today.\n\n05:18.000 --> 05:26.000\nBut also, the problem is they're 20 and they're going like, what? 40 years ago, you were racist.\n\n05:26.000 --> 05:34.000\nThat's crazy. But everything 40 years ago was crazy to you. You weren't born.\n\n05:34.000 --> 05:41.000\nHe's telling a story about how fucked up he was so long ago.\n\n05:41.000 --> 05:47.000\nLook, Dan Harmon goes to bat for Liam Neeson. Fuck off.\n\n05:47.000 --> 05:55.000\nI want us to stop destroying each other. I want the cloud that we're becoming.\n\n05:55.000 --> 05:58.000\nI don't think any individual is becoming a worse person because of the internet.\n\n05:58.000 --> 06:04.000\nHow does Liam Neeson know to not tell that story? If that happened...\n\n06:04.000 --> 06:10.000\nThat's the biggest tragedy of all. The answer is because he felt comfortable and he wanted to confess.\n\n06:10.000 --> 06:13.000\nWhat do you want to confess, Dan?\n\n06:13.000 --> 06:15.000\nThat would be great, wouldn't it?\n\n06:15.000 --> 06:19.000\nI'm supposed to stand here and say, from now on, forget it.\n\n06:19.000 --> 06:25.000\nEvery night, I go to bed and I'm like, what am I doing this for?\n\n06:25.000 --> 06:30.000\nUp and down, the answer is to keep a gun out of my mouth because if I don't talk my mind into a microphone,\n\n06:30.000 --> 06:35.000\nit bounces around inside my skull and it's going to get worse and worse and worse.\n\n06:35.000 --> 06:39.000\nAm I doing this for me? Am I doing this for other people? I don't even know anymore.\n\n06:39.000 --> 06:46.000\nI know that the day I quit, I can't quit tomorrow because it'll be Dan Harmon quits podcast\n\n06:46.000 --> 06:50.000\nand dust up over Liam Neeson's story.\n\n06:50.000 --> 06:54.000\nI have to now wait until it's gas prices.\n\n06:54.000 --> 06:58.000\nNow we have one more year of me and these ads.\n\n06:58.000 --> 07:02.000\nI'm still waiting until it's...\n\n07:02.000 --> 07:08.000\nLook, man, I don't think that there's anything that any individual can do\n\n07:08.000 --> 07:11.000\nbecause I think that every individual is actually a good person.\n\n07:11.000 --> 07:16.000\nThe thing that I'm going through right now, I tell my therapist all the time, I'm like, I hate everyone\n\n07:16.000 --> 07:19.000\nexcept for anyone I meet.\n\n07:19.000 --> 07:22.000\nI hate, but none of us are meeting each other.\n\n07:22.000 --> 07:26.000\nI hate what we've become. I hate the cloud.\n\n07:26.000 --> 07:29.000\nI hate this collective behavior.\n\n07:29.000 --> 07:33.000\nI said it before when the weatherman was...\n\n07:33.000 --> 07:37.000\nHe accidentally said the wrong word and stuff like that.\n\n07:37.000 --> 07:43.000\nI express the sentiment of out of sympathy for actually the people that get outraged,\n\n07:43.000 --> 07:47.000\nall of whom I believe I give them credit as an American.\n\n07:47.000 --> 07:51.000\nI bet they don't want the power over whether someone gets fired.\n\n07:51.000 --> 07:57.000\nIf you and I are on a smoke break out in the sidewalk, what we want to do is talk shit about Liam Neeson.\n\n07:57.000 --> 07:58.000\nWe want to like...\n\n07:58.000 --> 08:06.000\nAnd we don't want a fucking drone to monitor what we say and then take it to his publicist and affect his career.\n\n08:06.000 --> 08:10.000\nWe want to be able to, with all of our primate hearts, go like, that was fucked up.\n\n08:10.000 --> 08:12.000\nI didn't like that. I don't like what he said.\n\n08:12.000 --> 08:13.000\nThat's the thing about this.\n\n08:13.000 --> 08:16.000\nWe want to be able to wake up the next day and go, yeah, I was talking a lot of shit.\n\n08:16.000 --> 08:20.000\nI don't know what the fuck I'm talking about. I need to read about it.\n\n08:20.000 --> 08:22.000\nThat's true. That's a human trait.\n\n08:22.000 --> 08:27.000\nIf you level the playing field, though, you can get away with whatever you want.\n\n08:27.000 --> 08:28.000\nWhat do you mean?\n\n08:28.000 --> 08:33.000\nI mean, what makes it difficult is that he spoke about a group of people who were disenfranchised.\n\n08:33.000 --> 08:39.000\nBut if you lift all the boats with the old tide, then you can talk shit about every boat.\n\n08:39.000 --> 08:41.000\nI still don't know what you mean.\n\n08:41.000 --> 08:42.000\nI know.\n\n08:42.000 --> 08:48.000\nI'm not supposed to. I want to know.\n\n08:48.000 --> 08:54.000\nLiterally, it's like, I love a good black joke if it's super funny because the super funny has lifted the tide\n\n08:54.000 --> 08:59.000\nbecause you are a craftsman who has made a wonderful joke, even at my own expense.\n\n08:59.000 --> 09:01.000\nSomething that I love to laugh at myself, right?\n\n09:01.000 --> 09:03.000\nThat's when we're cool.\n\n09:03.000 --> 09:08.000\nWe're not cool if I'm broke as fuck and you're pointing at me as you make the joke.\n\n09:08.000 --> 09:12.000\nSo what we want is a world where I can talk shit about women and Jews and gays\n\n09:12.000 --> 09:16.000\nbecause women and Jews and gays are doing so fucking well that even they're like,\n\n09:16.000 --> 09:19.000\nI am a little weird.\n\n09:19.000 --> 09:21.000\nRight, but how does that sound?\n\n09:21.000 --> 09:28.000\nI mean, when Mr. Neeson was making this confession, he was saying like 40 years ago,\n\n09:28.000 --> 09:29.000\nBastards.\n\n09:29.000 --> 09:32.000\nHe so didn't want, it was that phrase for sure.\n\n09:32.000 --> 09:37.000\nIt was alliterative and it was like clickable and it was like...\n\n09:37.000 --> 09:40.000\nI wish you would say my name with Bastard behind it to my face.\n\n09:40.000 --> 09:44.000\nNow, if you say black in front of that, you kind of say my name\n\n09:44.000 --> 09:47.000\nbecause I like to go with Black Brandon some days.\n\n09:47.000 --> 09:48.000\nBlack Brandon.\n\n09:48.000 --> 09:49.000\nOh, Black Brandon.\n\n09:49.000 --> 09:51.000\nI'm a pirate.\n\n09:51.000 --> 09:53.000\nBut that's the issue.\n\n09:53.000 --> 09:56.000\nThe issue is, whoa, Black Brandon.\n\n09:56.000 --> 09:59.000\nI'm a brand new suit on Black and Brandon.\n\n09:59.000 --> 10:00.000\nBut that's the game.\n\n10:00.000 --> 10:03.000\nThe game is, if you lift everybody up, you can do whatever fuck you want.\n\n10:03.000 --> 10:05.000\nJoke should always be funny.\n\n10:05.000 --> 10:10.000\nIf you're going to tell a racial joke, the only rule is it has to be,\n\n10:10.000 --> 10:14.000\nyou can't lower the status of the target.\n\n10:14.000 --> 10:19.000\nIf it's funny that the person's black or Jewish or a woman or whatever\n\n10:19.000 --> 10:22.000\nand they still win, that's a funny joke.\n\n10:22.000 --> 10:27.000\nWe're using the joke thing as a template because what we understand is jokes\n\n10:27.000 --> 10:29.000\nand we know that he wasn't making a joke, right?\n\n10:29.000 --> 10:30.000\nIt was Bastard.\n\n10:30.000 --> 10:36.000\nIt does apply like a rubbing from joke to confession\n\n10:36.000 --> 10:44.000\nbecause in his confession, he didn't lift up while he kind of confessed\n\n10:44.000 --> 10:46.000\nthat he was dehumanizing.\n\n10:46.000 --> 10:51.000\nFor instance, there's a joke I made on TV once that was aired\n\n10:51.000 --> 10:53.000\nand it was a funny joke at the time.\n\n10:53.000 --> 10:56.000\nIf I could go back in time, I would erase that from memory\n\n10:56.000 --> 10:58.000\nbecause it was not a joke.\n\n10:58.000 --> 11:00.000\nOh, you have one of those? Aren't you adorable?\n\n11:00.000 --> 11:03.000\nNo, I mean, I'm thinking of one in particular.\n\n11:03.000 --> 11:06.000\nAnd it was funny at the time.\n\n11:06.000 --> 11:11.000\nIf I told that joke today, I think it would be horrible.\n\n11:11.000 --> 11:15.000\nAnd also, I'm sad that I said it once a long time ago.\n\n11:15.000 --> 11:19.000\nAnd could we all retract a thousand things that we said?\n\n11:19.000 --> 11:20.000\nAbsolutely.\n\n11:20.000 --> 11:22.000\nI think that's how everybody...\n\n11:22.000 --> 11:29.000\nI mean, maybe I'm unique in that I've kind of aerosoled myself from the age of 23\n\n11:29.000 --> 11:33.000\ngoing, look at me, look at me, look at me, every shit I take, every thought I think.\n\n11:33.000 --> 11:35.000\nEvery breath you take?\n\n11:35.000 --> 11:37.000\nEvery move you make?\n\n11:37.000 --> 11:40.000\nAnd all darkness and all of the time and all what I could get away with at the time.\n\n11:40.000 --> 11:46.000\nIt's so much misogyny, so much racism, so much unfashionable thought\n\n11:46.000 --> 11:49.000\nin a world where it's moving so quickly.\n\n11:49.000 --> 11:51.000\nI am absolutely biased.\n\n11:51.000 --> 11:54.000\nI have an agenda when I call for forgiveness.\n\n11:54.000 --> 11:57.000\nWe've lost our shame on the Internet, which is a good thing,\n\n11:57.000 --> 12:00.000\nbecause so much shame needed to be lost.\n\n12:00.000 --> 12:03.000\nIt was being used to hold so many people back.\n\n12:03.000 --> 12:05.000\nBut we've also lost our grace, maybe?\n\n12:05.000 --> 12:07.000\nWe've lost our forgiveness.\n\n12:07.000 --> 12:13.000\nI mean, we are just recreationally and collectively hurting each other.\n\n12:13.000 --> 12:18.000\nThere's no call to action because I don't think you or you or you or you or you\n\n12:18.000 --> 12:23.000\nor you or any individual, I don't think anyone's actually becoming a bad person.\n\n12:23.000 --> 12:30.000\nI think that we're evolving into a collective organism that is doing some terrible things to the individual.\n\n12:30.000 --> 12:33.000\nIf we've all chosen a life where we all want everyone to hear us,\n\n12:33.000 --> 12:37.000\nthey have to hear us be our worst at all times too.\n\n12:37.000 --> 12:40.000\nAnd then we have to learn to shut up.\n\n12:40.000 --> 12:47.000\nLike, we're asking for followers and we're happy every time we get more followers,\n\n12:47.000 --> 12:52.000\nbut we're bummed out every time everybody heard us fart or burp or say something\n\n12:52.000 --> 12:55.000\nthat we should have thought twice before we said.\n\n12:55.000 --> 12:59.000\nReal clear, it's not the 40 years ago that he was racist.\n\n12:59.000 --> 13:01.000\nIt was the current day he was a bastard.\n\n13:01.000 --> 13:07.000\nSo one of the things in all speeches, we don't mind if you say black hero, black big dick,\n\n13:07.000 --> 13:10.000\ndon't say black bad parent, don't say black bad bot.\n\n13:10.000 --> 13:11.000\nDon't do that.\n\n13:11.000 --> 13:16.000\nSo with him, had he not said bastard, he just said black dudes would have been on his side.\n\n13:16.000 --> 13:22.000\nThat's getting really specific because maybe you, did you see the super specific like the way he,\n\n13:22.000 --> 13:26.000\nbecause I'm imagining it again, I'm refusing to click and yet I'm going like,\n\n13:26.000 --> 13:28.000\neveryone let's just love each other.\n\n13:28.000 --> 13:34.000\nBut he surely was characterizing himself as an unreliable narrator.\n\n13:34.000 --> 13:36.000\nNo, he wasn't saying that word.\n\n13:36.000 --> 13:40.000\nYou're saying just like, come on, if you don't know how to navigate those waters in general.\n\n13:40.000 --> 13:43.000\nYeah, because you say Adderall, Comic-Con.\n\n13:43.000 --> 13:48.000\nI would say too many interviews, tired, telling stories, getting too casual.\n\n13:48.000 --> 13:54.000\nAnd he was just like, after my friend got raped, I went out and I wanted to kill the first black bastard that I saw.\n\n13:54.000 --> 13:56.000\nAnd I went looking for one.\n\n13:56.000 --> 13:57.000\nIs the problem.\n\n13:57.000 --> 14:02.000\nThe problem is that something happened to someone you knew and it caused you to be predatory.\n\n14:02.000 --> 14:07.000\nWhen the reality is, if that were true, I'd clean this theater out.\n\n14:07.000 --> 14:13.000\nExcept for gray.\n\n14:13.000 --> 14:15.000\nThat's really interesting.\n\n14:15.000 --> 14:19.000\nLike you thought that you think like he let down.\n\n14:19.000 --> 14:20.000\nThat's what I think happened.\n\n14:20.000 --> 14:24.000\nHis garden was like almost humble bragging about it.\n\n14:24.000 --> 14:27.000\nLike he was asked how he got into character.\n\n14:27.000 --> 14:28.000\nInteresting.\n\n14:28.000 --> 14:29.000\nReally interesting.\n\n14:29.000 --> 14:31.000\nI want to tell you one thing.\n\n14:31.000 --> 14:32.000\nWe're going to bring our guest out.\n\n14:32.000 --> 14:33.000\nHe's been waiting too long.\n\n14:33.000 --> 14:41.000\nLadies and gentlemen, Liam Neeson.\n\n14:41.000 --> 14:43.000\nYou do a good Liam Neeson impression.\n\n14:43.000 --> 14:45.000\nDo you want to apologize for Liam Neeson?\n\n14:45.000 --> 14:47.000\nNo, we're not doing that joke.\n\n14:47.000 --> 14:50.000\nIt won't help anybody.\n\n14:50.000 --> 14:52.000\nThat joke is obvious.\n\n14:52.000 --> 14:53.000\nI get it.\n\n14:53.000 --> 14:57.000\nThey're biological killing machines.\n\n14:57.000 --> 15:00.000\nWe're not connecting those dots.\n\n15:00.000 --> 15:02.000\nBut you just did it.\n\n15:02.000 --> 15:05.000\nI'm going to tell you in advance until the end of my career,\n\n15:05.000 --> 15:07.000\nwhich is obviously going to be shortly,\n\n15:07.000 --> 15:10.000\ngiven that it goes back to shit that you've already done.\n\n15:10.000 --> 15:15.000\nI'm going to continue to, with absolutely no mistake,\n\n15:15.000 --> 15:22.000\nthat I'm in the kind of like, that it's not the way to win a popularity contest.\n\n15:22.000 --> 15:27.000\nLike I'm going to go with my heart and I'm going to continue to side with the person,\n\n15:27.000 --> 15:32.000\nthe individual who is currently at that point walking the plank.\n\n15:32.000 --> 15:35.000\nI don't care how bad.\n\n15:35.000 --> 15:37.000\nI figure if they're out on the plank,\n\n15:37.000 --> 15:39.000\nI just want to feel bad for them.\n\n15:39.000 --> 15:41.000\nI don't care what they've done.\n\n15:41.000 --> 15:45.000\nI think that may be a lot of projection on my part when I'm just like,\n\n15:45.000 --> 15:48.000\nI spent so much time.\n\n15:48.000 --> 15:51.000\nI just feel like I've always been that guy.\n\n15:51.000 --> 15:59.000\nAnd I didn't get this far to like, I don't want to like poke people off of that plank.\n\n15:59.000 --> 16:04.000\nIf they're walking it for a reason, then they're walking off of it.\n\n16:04.000 --> 16:09.000\nBut anyways, I wanted to say one thing to you.\n\n16:09.000 --> 16:10.000\nSure.\n\n16:10.000 --> 16:12.000\nYou.\n\n16:12.000 --> 16:15.000\nBefore we bring our guest out, because I was like,\n\n16:15.000 --> 16:17.000\nSpencer dropped out.\n\n16:17.000 --> 16:19.000\nSo sorry, God loves Spencer.\n\n16:19.000 --> 16:23.000\nI was I was I was thinking about the Liam Neeson thing was putting on my me undies,\n\n16:23.000 --> 16:25.000\nwhich are three times softer than cotton.\n\n16:25.000 --> 16:28.000\nAnd I was having this like internal monologue in my head.\n\n16:28.000 --> 16:31.000\nI started thinking about the Michael Richards thing.\n\n16:31.000 --> 16:36.000\nAnd the the weird turning point in the Michael Richards thing for me,\n\n16:36.000 --> 16:41.000\nand I swear I'm not being hyperbolic about the personalization of this.\n\n16:41.000 --> 16:45.000\nI remember distinctly because this podcast is so goddamn old.\n\n16:45.000 --> 16:50.000\nI remember carrying the Michael Richards thing into Harmontown at Melt Town.\n\n16:50.000 --> 16:54.000\nAnd I remember talking to you and DeMorge about it,\n\n16:54.000 --> 16:56.000\nlike talking about it in the green room.\n\n16:56.000 --> 17:00.000\nAnd both of you guys, like my epiphany was like because I was coming and going,\n\n17:00.000 --> 17:03.000\ncan you fucking believe this?\n\n17:03.000 --> 17:06.000\nAnd the two of you basically going like, yeah.\n\n17:06.000 --> 17:10.000\nIn a way that was like, yeah, that's the world we live in.\n\n17:10.000 --> 17:14.000\nAnd it flipped my magnetic poles because I was like, that's important.\n\n17:14.000 --> 17:16.000\nThat's why I bring this shit up too.\n\n17:16.000 --> 17:18.000\nBecause I'm like, what is your hot take?\n\n17:18.000 --> 17:22.000\nDo you remember clicking on this Liam Neeson thing and like help me parse it?\n\n17:22.000 --> 17:25.000\nBecause as a middle-aged white guy, I'm going to be like,\n\n17:25.000 --> 17:27.000\nthey're trying to take our rights away.\n\n17:27.000 --> 17:32.000\nI mean, last real quick thing is that remember that he kisses Viola Davis\n\n17:32.000 --> 17:34.000\nso hard in that movie recently.\n\n17:34.000 --> 17:36.000\nI can't remember what the name of it is.\n\n17:36.000 --> 17:40.000\nAnd there is this thing that black celebrities are saying, which is,\n\n17:40.000 --> 17:44.000\nhe can't be racist because he is very intimate with Viola Davis in this movie.\n\n17:44.000 --> 17:48.000\nSo I do think that that was way back in the day and that he does work on himself\n\n17:48.000 --> 17:50.000\nand that he probably isn't racist.\n\n17:50.000 --> 17:52.000\nIt's just he doesn't know how to tell a story to the press.\n\n17:52.000 --> 17:54.000\nOkay, one more thing and then we'll bring our guest out.\n\n17:54.000 --> 17:56.000\nSure.\n\n17:56.000 --> 18:01.000\nRacism, it's a fucking, it's not a blood type.\n\n18:01.000 --> 18:04.000\nIt's a phenomenon, right?\n\n18:04.000 --> 18:06.000\nIt's not that phenomenon.\n\n18:06.000 --> 18:08.000\nIt's like influenza.\n\n18:08.000 --> 18:13.000\nYou can't eradicate it by finding people with it and burning them.\n\n18:13.000 --> 18:17.000\nYou maybe can state a purpose.\n\n18:17.000 --> 18:18.000\nYou can state a mission statement.\n\n18:18.000 --> 18:19.000\nI'm against influenza.\n\n18:19.000 --> 18:22.000\nYour nose is so running, I'm going to kill you.\n\n18:22.000 --> 18:25.000\nBut if you genuinely are against the principle,\n\n18:25.000 --> 18:27.000\nyou should accept that it's fucking everywhere.\n\n18:27.000 --> 18:29.000\nJust rise the boats.\n\n18:29.000 --> 18:31.000\nIf we all do that part, then we don't have to worry about it.\n\n18:31.000 --> 18:34.000\nThere's shit we need to do to prepare for it, to deal with it.\n\n18:34.000 --> 18:36.000\nNo, you just got to rise the boats.\n\n18:36.000 --> 18:38.000\nJust rise the boats.\n\n18:38.000 --> 18:40.000\nI mean, I like this.\n\n18:40.000 --> 18:42.000\nRacism is a spectrum.\n\n18:42.000 --> 18:44.000\nIt's a sociological phenomenon.\n\n18:44.000 --> 18:49.000\nIt happens because it'll happen until the day race stops.\n\n18:49.000 --> 18:52.000\nYou're severely underestimating the people that it affects.\n\n18:52.000 --> 18:54.000\nBut let's bring out that guest.\n\n18:54.000 --> 18:57.000\nOkay, let's bring out our guest and get deeper\n\n18:57.000 --> 19:01.000\nand either more or less podcast worthy, I don't know.\n\n19:01.000 --> 19:03.000\nHe's our new friend.\n\n19:03.000 --> 19:06.000\nHe's soaring up the charts.\n\n19:06.000 --> 19:08.000\nHe's currently resided in Portland,\n\n19:08.000 --> 19:12.000\nbut if ICE has it their way,\n\n19:12.000 --> 19:14.000\nhe won't be in Portland for much longer.\n\n19:14.000 --> 19:17.000\nPlease welcome Mohanad Elshiki.\n\n19:17.000 --> 19:35.000\nWhat's up Mohanad?\n\n19:35.000 --> 19:37.000\nIs your mic working?\n\n19:37.000 --> 19:39.000\nYeah, it is working.\n\n19:39.000 --> 19:41.000\nWe're good.\n\n19:41.000 --> 19:44.000\nAlright, you're from Libya, Benghazi,\n\n19:44.000 --> 19:46.000\nwhich until I researched you this morning,\n\n19:46.000 --> 19:48.000\nI thought Benghazi was like a made up word\n\n19:48.000 --> 19:50.000\nwe used to hate Hillary Clinton.\n\n19:50.000 --> 19:52.000\nI wish it was.\n\n19:52.000 --> 19:54.000\nIt's actually a city in Libya.\n\n19:54.000 --> 19:56.000\nIt is a city in Libya.\n\n19:56.000 --> 19:58.000\nIt's where I lived.\n\n19:58.000 --> 20:00.000\nIt's sometimes filled made up.\n\n20:00.000 --> 20:02.000\nI want to start there.\n\n20:02.000 --> 20:04.000\nYou're like the immigration equivalent of,\n\n20:04.000 --> 20:07.000\nI'm starstruck because I don't think I've ever known someone\n\n20:07.000 --> 20:09.000\nthat had asylum.\n\n20:09.000 --> 20:12.000\nFor all the talk we do about asylum.\n\n20:12.000 --> 20:15.000\nAnd I want to talk so much about that.\n\n20:15.000 --> 20:17.000\nSo tracing it from,\n\n20:17.000 --> 20:19.000\nbut first I just want to picture\n\n20:19.000 --> 20:21.000\nbecause you're growing up\n\n20:21.000 --> 20:24.000\nin part of a gigantic blind spot for me.\n\n20:24.000 --> 20:27.000\nChildhood in Libya,\n\n20:27.000 --> 20:30.000\nyou can be comedic, tragic, sad, whatever.\n\n20:30.000 --> 20:33.000\nHonestly, this is a funny question you're asking\n\n20:33.000 --> 20:35.000\nbecause a lot of people,\n\n20:35.000 --> 20:38.000\nwhen they imagine my child in Libya,\n\n20:38.000 --> 20:41.000\nthey always go to some war zone.\n\n20:41.000 --> 20:44.000\nI'm afraid to tell you what I would picture,\n\n20:44.000 --> 20:46.000\nbut you can imagine.\n\n20:46.000 --> 20:48.000\nI'll tell you the picture.\n\n20:48.000 --> 20:50.000\nThe picture is like me being a child soldier.\n\n20:50.000 --> 20:52.000\nI'm going to defend my mom.\n\n20:52.000 --> 20:54.000\nIt's like those backgrounds where the road\n\n20:54.000 --> 20:56.000\nis the same color as the building.\n\n20:56.000 --> 20:58.000\nExactly.\n\n20:58.000 --> 21:00.000\nYou can't tell.\n\n21:00.000 --> 21:02.000\nMy childhood was very chill.\n\n21:02.000 --> 21:04.000\nWhat did the neighborhood look like?\n\n21:04.000 --> 21:06.000\nIf it didn't look like that,\n\n21:06.000 --> 21:08.000\nmy first world xenophobic images,\n\n21:08.000 --> 21:10.000\ndoes it look like\n\n21:10.000 --> 21:12.000\nthe Munsters neighborhood?\n\n21:12.000 --> 21:14.000\nIt looks like the Cleavers.\n\n21:14.000 --> 21:16.000\nI don't know what reference to drive.\n\n21:16.000 --> 21:18.000\nHonestly, I look around the land.\n\n21:18.000 --> 21:20.000\nThere's some houses that we had that looked the same.\n\n21:20.000 --> 21:22.000\nThe structure was more like...\n\n21:22.000 --> 21:24.000\nIt was kind of different\n\n21:24.000 --> 21:26.000\nbecause the houses were...\n\n21:26.000 --> 21:28.000\nWe don't have houses built...\n\n21:28.000 --> 21:30.000\nI don't know how to describe it.\n\n21:30.000 --> 21:32.000\nThe material here that people use,\n\n21:32.000 --> 21:34.000\nit's more like cement.\n\n21:34.000 --> 21:36.000\nThis is how I would describe it.\n\n21:36.000 --> 21:38.000\nWhen I was growing up,\n\n21:38.000 --> 21:40.000\nwhen I see someone gets angry on TV,\n\n21:40.000 --> 21:42.000\nthey punch a wall and they get through it.\n\n21:42.000 --> 21:44.000\nIn Libya, you can't do that.\n\n21:44.000 --> 21:46.000\nYou punch a wall,\n\n21:46.000 --> 21:48.000\nthat's it, you're dead.\n\n21:48.000 --> 21:50.000\nIt's like the cement block kind of...\n\n21:50.000 --> 21:52.000\nExactly.\n\n21:52.000 --> 21:54.000\nThere were a lot of fistles\n\n21:54.000 --> 21:56.000\nin my house growing up,\n\n21:56.000 --> 21:58.000\nand then there would be these dents\n\n21:58.000 --> 22:00.000\nwhere you found a stud.\n\n22:00.000 --> 22:02.000\nThat's why people assumed\n\n22:02.000 --> 22:04.000\nthey were super angry.\n\n22:04.000 --> 22:06.000\nYou can't even punch a wall there.\n\n22:06.000 --> 22:08.000\nYou start a war, that's what you do.\n\n22:08.000 --> 22:10.000\nWhen did you leave Libya?\n\n22:10.000 --> 22:12.000\nI left Libya in 2014,\n\n22:12.000 --> 22:14.000\nso I was 23 when I left.\n\n22:14.000 --> 22:16.000\nYou came straight to\n\n22:16.000 --> 22:18.000\nLA?\n\n22:18.000 --> 22:20.000\nNo, Portland.\n\n22:20.000 --> 22:22.000\nInitially, I came on\n\n22:22.000 --> 22:24.000\nan exchange program.\n\n22:24.000 --> 22:26.000\nIt was supposed to be for six weeks.\n\n22:26.000 --> 22:28.000\nThis is nightmare fuel for me.\n\n22:28.000 --> 22:30.000\nI'm going to use my eye statements.\n\n22:30.000 --> 22:32.000\nI'm not going to say for white people.\n\n22:32.000 --> 22:34.000\nThis is nightmare fuel for me.\n\n22:34.000 --> 22:36.000\nYou were a special kid,\n\n22:36.000 --> 22:38.000\nsmart, bright.\n\n22:38.000 --> 22:40.000\nI'm assuming I'm identifying\n\n22:40.000 --> 22:42.000\nwith you.\n\n22:42.000 --> 22:44.000\nYou're 14, you're in Benghazi.\n\n22:44.000 --> 22:46.000\nPeople are probably coming up to you\n\n22:46.000 --> 22:48.000\nand going, hey, you're funny.\n\n22:48.000 --> 22:50.000\nTalk and talk,\n\n22:50.000 --> 22:52.000\nand you become an exchange student.\n\n22:52.000 --> 22:54.000\nWhile you're here,\n\n22:54.000 --> 22:56.000\nhere being America,\n\n22:56.000 --> 22:58.000\nare you getting\n\n22:58.000 --> 23:00.000\ntexts or emails?\n\n23:00.000 --> 23:02.000\nThis is the story leading to your quest\n\n23:02.000 --> 23:04.000\nfor asylum.\n\n23:04.000 --> 23:06.000\nFacebook messages\n\n23:06.000 --> 23:08.000\nfrom family.\n\n23:08.000 --> 23:10.000\nSaying.\n\n23:10.000 --> 23:12.000\nWhen I moved here, I was 23.\n\n23:12.000

Libya?\n\n34:10.000 --> 34:12.000\nAfter Gaddafi died?\n\n34:12.000 --> 34:14.000\nYes, because there were a lot of\n\n34:14.000 --> 34:16.000\nreligious extremism\n\n34:16.000 --> 34:18.000\nIt became sort of a free-for-all\n\n34:18.000 --> 34:20.000\nYeah, exactly, because there was\n\n34:20.000 --> 34:22.000\nthe Libyan military and then you have\n\n34:22.000 --> 34:24.000\ngroups that were like\n\n34:24.000 --> 34:26.000\nYou had Wolf Blitzer's stink on you\n\n34:26.000 --> 34:28.000\nWolf Blitzer touched you as a baby bird\n\n34:28.000 --> 34:30.000\nExactly, and then\n\n34:30.000

--> 34:52.000\nDid I feel terrified?\n\n34:52.000 --> 34:54.000\nDid I feel bad?\n\n34:54.000 --> 34:56.000\nNot really, because\n\n34:56.000 --> 34:58.000\nI've had worse stuff happen\n\n34:58.000

because you asked\n\n46:58.000 --> 47:00.000\nlet's hear you Sean Connery most things\n\n47:00.000 --> 47:02.000\ndown here don't react well to bullets\n\n47:02.000 --> 47:04.000\nokay all right well whatever but it's like\n\n47:04.000 --> 47:06.000\nif you if you if you work\n\n47:06.000 --> 47:08.000\nwell under pressure I'll tell you the joke\n\n47:08.000 --> 47:10.000\nyeah yeah yeah so\n\n47:10.000 --> 47:12.000\nso yeah we\n\n47:12.000 --> 47:14.000\nwe live in such a weird time because a lot\n\n47:14.000 --> 47:16.000\nof people have\n\n47:16.000 --> 47:18.000\nopinions\n\n47:18.000 --> 47:20.000\nyou know and have you seen those\n\n47:20.000 --> 47:22.000\nyeah they're there\n\n47:22.000 --> 47:24.000\nand\n\n47:24.000 --> 47:26.000\nespecially about stuff like guns for example\n\n47:26.000 --> 47:28.000\nbecause a lot of people have opinions\n\n47:28.000 --> 47:30.000\nabout that and mostly everyone is\n\n47:30.000 --> 47:32.000\nwrong\n\n47:32.000 --> 47:34.000\nand I as a comedian like every time a shooting\n\n47:34.000 --> 47:36.000\nhappen or something I have to go on social media\n\n47:36.000 --> 47:38.000\nand I have to like tweet something clever\n\n47:38.000 --> 47:40.000\nyou know to like raise awareness\n\n47:40.000 --> 47:42.000\nthat I exist\n\n47:42.000 --> 47:44.000\nand\n\n47:44.000 --> 47:46.000\nlast time a shooting happens I just went\n\n47:46.000 --> 47:48.000\nand I tweeted and I wrote that we shouldn't be\n\n47:48.000 --> 47:50.000\nsending thoughts and prayers and we should\n\n47:50.000 --> 47:52.000\nbe praying for more gun control\n\n47:54.000 --> 47:56.000\nwhich to me sounded\n\n47:56.000 --> 47:58.000\nlike a very logical statement\n\n47:58.000 --> 48:00.000\nto post on the internet\n\n48:00.000 --> 48:02.000\nwith the name mohaned\n\n48:06.000 --> 48:08.000\nand I believed in everything I said\n\n48:08.000 --> 48:10.000\nuntil that guy Kevin\n\n48:10.000 --> 48:12.000\nreplied to me\n\n48:12.000 --> 48:14.000\nyou guys know Kevin\n\n48:14.000 --> 48:16.000\nyeah from social media\n\n48:16.000 --> 48:18.000\nyeah he's there too\n\n48:20.000 --> 48:22.000\nand Kevin replied to me this is what Kevin said\n\n48:22.000 --> 48:24.000\nand I quote\n\n48:24.000 --> 48:26.000\nyou fucking Muslim\n\n48:26.000 --> 48:28.000\nI eat bacon 24\n\n48:28.000 --> 48:30.000\n7\n\n48:30.000 --> 48:32.000\nwhich is quite impressive\n\n48:32.000 --> 48:34.000\nI was like man I don't\n\n48:34.000 --> 48:36.000\neat bacon but I think that's super unhealthy\n\n48:36.000 --> 48:38.000\nalso probably\n\n48:38.000 --> 48:40.000\nthe worst argument\n\n48:40.000 --> 48:42.000\nagainst gun control\n\n48:42.000 --> 48:44.000\njust shouting your favorite food at me\n\n48:44.000 --> 48:46.000\nyeah Kevin is dead now\n\n48:48.000 --> 48:50.000\nit's that pause\n\n48:50.000 --> 48:52.000\nthat's the thing that I focus on is the\n\n48:52.000 --> 48:54.000\nit's the pause\n\n48:54.000 --> 48:56.000\nwhere you describe your tweet because I live\n\n48:56.000 --> 48:58.000\nin the cynical world where\n\n48:58.000 --> 49:00.000\nwhatever I think of\n\n49:00.000 --> 49:02.000\nPortland I don't even know\n\n49:02.000 --> 49:04.000\nI was like I'm watching from Los Angeles\n\n49:04.000 --> 49:06.000\nwatching the YouTube clip of you\n\n49:06.000 --> 49:08.000\nin front of 100 people in Portland\n\n49:08.000 --> 49:10.000\nand I don't know what's going through\n\n49:10.000 --> 49:12.000\nyour head when you're willing\n\n49:12.000 --> 49:14.000\nto go so I tweeted\n\n49:14.000 --> 49:16.000\nthoughts and prayers\n\n49:16.000 --> 49:18.000\nand a while\n\n49:18.000 --> 49:20.000\nI've become so jaded\n\n49:20.000 --> 49:22.000\nso cynical that\n\n49:22.000 --> 49:24.000\nI'm like I would never ever\n\n49:24.000 --> 49:26.000\nI gotta I can't\n\n49:26.000 --> 49:28.000\nI can't let this rest happen because\n\n49:28.000 --> 49:30.000\nsomeone will\n\n49:30.000 --> 49:32.000\nfuck it up can you talk about that\n\n49:32.000 --> 49:34.000\ndid you vet that\n\n49:34.000 --> 49:36.000\nsilence?\n\n49:36.000 --> 49:38.000\nI mean the silence exists there for a reason\n\n49:38.000 --> 49:40.000\nbecause some of the jokes I do\n\n49:40.000 --> 49:42.000\npeople would do that\n\n49:42.000 --> 49:44.000\nsomeone would jump in\n\n49:44.000 --> 49:46.000\nor just say something stupid\n\n49:46.000 --> 49:48.000\nand ruin the whole thing\n\n49:48.000 --> 49:50.000\nbut I've done it a few times to see\n\n49:50.000 --> 49:52.000\nthat silence makes it even better\n\n49:52.000 --> 49:54.000\nand\n\n49:54.000 --> 49:56.000\nI think it's mostly because of the way\n\n49:56.000 --> 49:58.000\nI say it because I talk very slowly\n\n49:58.000 --> 50:00.000\nand stuff\n\n50:00.000 --> 50:02.000\nand I get the impression there's something else coming out\n\n50:02.000 --> 50:04.000\nso people\n\n50:04.000 --> 50:06.000\non the edge to see what's gonna come next\n\n50:06.000 --> 50:08.000\nso no one will interrupt the silence\n\n50:08.000 --> 50:10.000\nand I think\n\n50:10.000 --> 50:12.000\nthe setup of someone else says it\n\n50:12.000 --> 50:14.000\nit would be more like yeah\n\n50:14.000 --> 50:16.000\nbut when I say\n\n50:16.000 --> 50:18.000\nI don't know where this is going\n\n50:18.000 --> 50:20.000\nbut I wanna hear it\n\n50:20.000 --> 50:22.000\nthat's gotta be like\n\n50:22.000 --> 50:24.000\nthat's so Portland\n\n50:24.000 --> 50:26.000\nis there a place in the states\n\n50:26.000 --> 50:28.000\nthat you can do comedy in Arabic?\n\n50:28.000 --> 50:30.000\nno\n\n50:30.000 --> 50:32.000\nI would never do comedy in Arabic\n\n50:32.000 --> 50:34.000\nhave you ever tried Arabic?\n\n50:34.000 --> 50:36.000\nI can tell stories in Arabic\n\n50:36.000 --> 50:38.000\nbut the structure of setup punchline\n\n50:38.000 --> 50:40.000\nis such a foreign concept\n\n50:40.000 --> 50:42.000\nto Arabic language that if you did it\n\n50:42.000 --> 50:44.000\npeople were like why are you quiet\n\n50:44.000 --> 50:46.000\nwhy did you stop?\n\n50:46.000 --> 50:48.000\nfor real I never thought of that\n\n50:48.000 --> 50:50.000\nis there any stand up culture\n\n50:50.000 --> 50:52.000\nin Arabic?\n\n50:52.000 --> 50:54.000\nthere is in some countries\n\n50:54.000 --> 50:56.000\nlike Lebanon\n\n50:56.000 --> 50:58.000\nif you go to\n\n50:58.000 --> 51:00.000\nit's more getting more recognized\n\n51:00.000 --> 51:02.000\nbut everything I've seen was more storytelling\n\n51:02.000 --> 51:04.000\nand I think it has to do with Arabic language\n\n51:04.000 --> 51:06.000\nit's more like\n\n51:06.000 --> 51:08.000\nyou have to keep going\n\n51:08.000 --> 51:10.000\nand it has to be\n\n51:10.000 --> 51:12.000\nlong stories\n\n51:12.000 --> 51:14.000\nso you can't just do setup punchline\n\n51:14.000 --> 51:16.000\nlike pauses\n\n51:16.000 --> 51:18.000\nlike traditional\n\n51:18.000 --> 51:20.000\nAmerican style\n\n51:20.000 --> 51:22.000\nsetup punchline\n\n51:22.000 --> 51:24.000\nabsolutely because this is a way\n\n51:24.000 --> 51:26.000\nI've learned how to talk in English that way\n\n51:26.000 --> 51:28.000\nwhen I did it here\n\n51:28.000 --> 51:30.000\nbecause when I speak in Arabic\n\n51:30.000 --> 51:32.000\nI never talk this way\n\n51:32.000 --> 51:34.000\nI talk way faster\n\n51:34.000 --> 51:36.000\nwhen you speak Arabic\n\n51:36.000 --> 51:38.000\neven when I'm telling a funny story in Arabic\n\n51:38.000 --> 51:40.000\nit's always full of energy\n\n51:40.000 --> 51:42.000\nand talking way faster\n\n51:42.000 --> 51:44.000\nis it politically incorrect to go\n\n51:44.000 --> 51:46.000\neven though we won't understand it\n\n51:46.000 --> 51:48.000\nI just want to hear you tell a story really fast\n\n51:48.000 --> 51:50.000\nin Arabic\n\n51:50.000 --> 51:52.000\nis that a weird\n\n51:52.000 --> 51:54.000\nbar joke\n\n51:54.000 --> 51:56.000\nlike a straight up joke joke\n\n51:56.000 --> 51:58.000\nlike a guy goes into a bar\n\n51:58.000 --> 52:00.000\nand the bartender says whatever\n\n52:00.000 --> 52:02.000\nwell we don't have bars\n\n52:04.000 --> 52:06.000\nit's already funny\n\n52:06.000 --> 52:08.000\nlike a proper\n\n52:08.000 --> 52:10.000\nstraight up\n\n52:10.000 --> 52:12.000\nI'm trying to think\n\n52:12.000 --> 52:14.000\nit was like a story I would say out loud\n\n52:14.000 --> 52:16.000\nbut I don't know maybe you can give me a few sentences\n\n52:16.000 --> 52:18.000\nI can say them in Arabic\n\n52:18.000 --> 52:20.000\ngive me a joke\n\n52:20.000 --> 52:22.000\na guy goes into a doctor's office\n\n52:22.000 --> 52:24.000\nand the doctor says\n\n52:24.000 --> 52:26.000\na guy\n\n52:26.000 --> 52:28.000\nwill be an interpreter\n\n52:28.000 --> 52:30.000\nand he'll be\n\n52:30.000 --> 52:32.000\npretend I'm Arabic\n\n52:32.000 --> 52:34.000\neven though I can't understand it\n\n52:34.000 --> 52:36.000\nand translate his\n\n52:36.000 --> 52:38.000\nbecause I have to go to the same speed as he\n\n52:38.000 --> 52:40.000\nyou want to click one?\n\n52:40.000 --> 52:42.000\na guy is getting his annual physical\n\n52:42.000 --> 52:44.000\nand the doctor\n\n52:44.000 --> 52:46.000\nlooks at his chart and says\n\n52:46.000 --> 52:48.000\nI'm afraid you're going to have to stop masturbating\n\n52:48.000 --> 52:50.000\nthe guy says why\n\n52:50.000 --> 52:52.000\nthe doctor says because I'm trying to give you a physical\n\n52:52.000 --> 52:54.000\nwhat is\n\n52:54.000 --> 52:56.000\nwhat is Ted Koppel saying\n\n52:56.000 --> 52:58.000\nto me\n\n52:58.000 --> 53:00.000\nI don't

54:44.000\nthis idea of\n\n54:44.000 --> 54:46.000\ndo you think in one language and translate it to another\n\n54:46.000 --> 54:48.000\nyou said something in the green room\n\n54:48.000 --> 54:50.000\nI think I've heard it before\n\n54:50.000 --> 54:52.000\nfrom other people that are bilingual\n\n54:52.000 --> 54:54.000\nyou said there was a transition\n\n54:54.000 --> 54:56.000\ntell me\n\n54:56.000 --> 54:58.000\nfor the first few years here\n\n54:58.000 --> 55:00.000\nI would speak in English but I would talk in Arabic\n\n55:00.000 --> 55:02.000\nI always had that transition\n\n55:02.000 --> 55:04.000\nwhen you tell me something\n\n55:04.000 --> 55:06.000\nit goes into that fast process\n\n55:06.000 --> 55:08.000\nfrom English to Arabic to Arabic to English\n\n55:08.000 --> 55:10.000\nnow I'm at the point\n\n55:10.000 --> 55:12.000\nwhere I even have my dreams in English\n\n55:12.000 --> 55:14.000\nI would be like I'm fully gentrified now\n\n55:14.000 --> 55:16.000\nso it changes\n\n55:16.000 --> 55:18.000\nthat's the thing\n\n55:18.000 --> 55:20.000\nwhen you learn a language\n\n55:20.000 --> 55:22.000\nwhen you start dreaming in the other language\n\n55:22.000 --> 55:24.000\nthat means your brain has completely\n\n55:24.000 --> 55:26.000\nabsolutely and now it's very strange\n\n55:26.000 --> 55:28.000\nbecause when I talk to

parents\n\n57:02.000 --> 57:04.000\ntheir thing with me\n\n57:04.000 --> 57:06.000\nis they would always be like\n\n57:06.000 --> 57:08.000\nhey do whatever you want\n\n57:08.000 --> 57:10.000\nyou can talk about whatever but can you tone it down\n\n57:10.000 --> 57:12.000\na bit\n\n57:12.000 --> 57:14.000\nso resonant\n\n57:14.000 --> 57:16.000\nsometimes my mom\n\n57:16.000 --> 57:18.000\nI would be outside of the house and I post something on facebook\n\n57:18.000 --> 57:20.000\nand she immediately calls me\n\n57:20.000 --> 57:22.000\nI'm like delete this right now\n\n57:22.000 -->

57:44.000\nare you allowed to go back home right now\n\n57:44.000 --> 57:46.000\nbecause that's part of the whole\n\n57:46.000 --> 57:48.000\nasylum process and getting the green card\n\n57:48.000 --> 57:50.000\nI cannot go back until I become a citizen\n\n57:50.000 --> 57:52.000\nin a few years\n\n57:52.000 --> 57:54.000\nbecause your whole case is built on the fact\n\n57:54.000 --> 57:56.000\nthat oh it's too dangerous for me to go back\n\n57:56.000 --> 57:58.000\nso if you go back\n\n57:58.000 --> 58:00.000\nyou're kind of like oh have you been lying this whole

don't have the resource for\n\n58:14.000 --> 58:16.000\nlawyers and\n\n58:16.000 --> 58:18.000\nthey do not\n\n58:18.000 --> 58:20.000\nand obviously the immigration\n\n58:20.000 --> 58:22.000\nwill give you a lawyer and that lawyer is handling 100 cases\n\n58:22.000 --> 58:24.000\nso there's so many\n\n58:24.000 --> 58:26.000\nand even with the lawyer\n\n58:26.000 --> 58:28.000\neven with everything\n\n58:28.000 --> 58:30.000\nthe process is very vague\n\n58:30.000 --> 58:32.000\nbecause\n\n58:32.000 --> 58:34.000\nwhen I applied\n\n58:34.000 --> 58:36.000\nthey were like okay so when do I do my interview\n\n58:36.000 --> 58:38.000\nand they were like\n\n58:38.000 --> 58:40.000\na few months a year, two years\n\n58:40.000 --> 58:42.000\nand then it was four\n\n58:42.000 --> 58:44.000\nso there was like no\n\n58:44.000 --> 58:46.000\nyou're just living in a limbo\n\n58:46.000 --> 58:48.000\nokay do I start my life\n\n58:48.000 --> 58:50.000\nand they're like where do I just have to wait\n\n58:50.000 --> 58:52.000\nI don't know\n\n58:52.000 --> 58:54.000\nwell I\n\n58:54.000 --> 58:56.000\nI finished like I did\n\n58:56.000 --> 58:58.000\nthe biggest step was getting your asylum approved\n\n58:58.000 --> 59:00.000\nwhich I did in last October\n\n59:00.000 --> 59:02.000\nwhich was great because it was such a relief\n\n59:02.000 --> 59:04.000\nbecause I was like I'm doing comedy\n\n59:04.000 --> 59:06.000\nand doing all of that but not knowing\n\n59:06.000 --> 59:08.000\nif I'm like because if they declined it\n\n59:08.000 --> 59:10.000\nit was just like it's like\n\n59:10.000 --> 59:12.000\nokay well you either\n\n59:12.000 --> 59:14.000\nhave to pay more money and hire a lawyer again\n\n59:14.000 --> 59:16.000\nand do all of that or you're welcome to leave\n\n59:16.000 --> 59:18.000\nso there was that\n\n59:18.000 --> 59:20.000\nso when it got approved I was like okay\n\n59:20.000 --> 59:22.000\nokay this is good\n\n59:22.000 --> 59:24.000\nso you're good to go now\n\n59:24.000 --> 59:26.000\nwell now yeah and next I told\n\n59:26.000 --> 59:28.000\nbut I get my green card which is great\n\n59:28.000 --> 59:30.000\nso I can come and go out and travel\n\n59:30.000 --> 59:32.000\nand like do all of that\n\n59:32.000 --> 59:34.000\nand then in three years from now\n\n59:34.000 --> 59:36.000\nI do become a citizen\n\n59:36.000 --> 59:38.000\nbut to make no mistake about it\n\n59:38.000 --> 59:40.000\nand sorry if this is like insensitive\n\n59:40.000 --> 59:42.000\nor whatever but this is just me\n\n59:42.000 --> 59:44.000\ngoing like\n\n59:44.000 --> 59:46.000\nI just\n\n59:46.000 --> 59:48.000\nI'm putting myself in these shoes\n\n59:48.000 --> 59:50.000\nlike\n\n59:50.000 --> 59:52.000\nso there are points in your life\n\n59:52.000 --> 59:54.000\nand I don't know how long they are\n\n59:54.000 --> 59:56.000\nand I don't know how extreme the walls of it are\n\n59:56.000 --> 59:58.000\nbut like you have

not only\n\n01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000\nthe airline travel is garbage\n\n01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000\neven if you're first class\n\n01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000\nthese people hate

someone would go\n\n01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000\nthat you would\n\n01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000\nbe sent back\n\n01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000\nand you would get to an airport\n\n01:00:46.000 -->
