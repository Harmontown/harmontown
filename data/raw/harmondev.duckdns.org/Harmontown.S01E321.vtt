WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:12.000
Let's bring out, we don't have a spender, but don't think of it as losing a spender.

00:12.000 --> 00:24.000
Think of it as gaining a Brandon Johnson, everybody.

00:24.000 --> 00:31.000
What up Brandon? Thank you so much for having me tonight, Jeff Davis. You looking good. You looking great. Thank you.

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Why don't we bring out the mayor of Harmontown? Dan Harmon.

00:36.000 --> 01:05.000
I had one note. I got mad because I'm recreationally house hunting.

01:05.000 --> 01:12.000
This will be a sympathetic bit. People will love this.

01:12.000 --> 01:17.000
I'm just looking around for houses and I don't like it.

01:17.000 --> 01:30.000
I just went to a house and they're like, hey, welcome to the open house and like you can either take off your shoes or you can put on these special surgical shoes like you're Mark Wahlberg about to shoot like somebody in the department.

01:30.000 --> 01:42.000
I'm never buying your house. Fuck you. Take off my shoes. Is it a house or not? A house is a giant shoe. A house is a shoe for your life.

01:42.000 --> 01:46.000
If you buy the house, you get to decide who wears a shoe and who doesn't wear the shoe.

01:46.000 --> 01:53.000
Yeah, but this is bad mojo. How much sage can you burn to get rid of the fucking foot of phobe that lives there?

01:53.000 --> 01:59.000
Do you want to buy a house where they didn't give a fuck about people with their gross feet all over the place?

01:59.000 --> 02:03.000
In a word? Yeah. I guess I don't want that mojo.

02:03.000 --> 02:10.000
That to me says that welcome to the house. Maybe you'd like to buy it. Take off your shoes or put on special booties.

02:10.000 --> 02:19.000
That to me says we hit all the bodies in the attic. There's just extra special attention put into dishonesty.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
Look, we're not getting off on the right foot.

02:21.000 --> 02:29.000
No, no, no. You are because I'm going to tell you if I come to your house and I'm trying to, you know, let's say you have a used Bentley, right? And it's $150,000. You pay $200,000 for it, right?

02:29.000 --> 02:33.000
If I want to sit in that motherfucker with some mud on my feet, I'm about to spend $150,000.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
Right.

02:34.000 --> 02:40.000
So if you're about to buy a house, yeah, you might want to walk up in that. You might say, I don't even know if this shit's comfortable unless I got mud on my feet.

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
Right. I think you're picking up what I'm laying down.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
Yeah.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
If I'm buying some shit, I should be able to use it as I would use it.

02:47.000 --> 02:52.000
Yeah. You want me to live in this shit or you want me to, or you want it to be less dirty for the next person that might live in it.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
Fuck you.

02:53.000 --> 02:57.000
I made a mud. I'm going to live in your house.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
Fucking Dan Harmon.

02:59.000 --> 03:04.000
Never asked me to take my shoes off. It's going to make your house more dirty, by the way.

03:04.000 --> 03:09.000
You think my shoes are fucked up? You should see my socks.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
You know what? You deserve it. There comes my shoes off.

03:12.000 --> 03:16.000
All right. Anyways, let's get things on a more, you know, I want to win the audience.

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
You know, I want to win the audience back. I feel bad for Liam Neeson.

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
That's a great way to win the audience back.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
What are you? My jokes agent?

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
Yes.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
I get 10% of your laughter.

03:30.000 --> 03:35.000
If you represent the joke, you're like making calls. Listen, there's a joke over here.

03:35.000 --> 03:40.000
What was his angle? What was he trying to do? He was coming clean about the fact that he went...

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
Black bastard.

03:42.000 --> 03:48.000
He was... I think... Part of me is like, I won't click on any of this shit because it feels...

03:48.000 --> 03:52.000
It's like my general sort of like, the internet's awful and all this stuff.

03:52.000 --> 03:57.000
But as far as... But I also don't think it's one of those stories where like, ooh, you got to do your research.

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
I believe that he was probably doing an interview.

04:00.000 --> 04:07.000
I think he kind of like... I've done a lot of interviews and when you're on a roll,

04:07.000 --> 04:11.000
maybe you've taken an extra milligram of Adderall and maybe you're at Comic-Con

04:11.000 --> 04:17.000
and you're like, someone's like pumping you up and being like, yeah, but seriously, why is Rick and Morty so genius?

04:17.000 --> 04:21.000
And you're like, this person, I can't do no wrong. Like, I want to try to explain myself.

04:21.000 --> 04:29.000
And like, I think he probably... He sidled into a confession about how crazy he was 40 years ago.

04:29.000 --> 04:37.000
40 years ago, and this is all of our mistake, is twice the median age of the people that control the planet.

04:37.000 --> 04:41.000
So none of them are ever going to go, oh, well, I get it.

04:41.000 --> 04:45.000
This is my realization. This is both my terror and my resignation.

04:45.000 --> 04:52.000
It's like, if you lived your life on the internet as I have, you are now...

04:52.000 --> 05:02.000
You have laid down a paper trail, like a landscape of you being a terrible person from the age of zero to 46.

05:02.000 --> 05:08.000
Now, today's 10-year-old who's born on the internet, and I say this out of sympathy to today's children,

05:08.000 --> 05:14.000
because they have to have 35 Instagram accounts so that their parents can't watch them go through puberty.

05:14.000 --> 05:18.000
I can't imagine what it's like to be 20 today.

05:18.000 --> 05:26.000
But also, the problem is they're 20 and they're going like, what? 40 years ago, you were racist.

05:26.000 --> 05:34.000
That's crazy. But everything 40 years ago was crazy to you. You weren't born.

05:34.000 --> 05:41.000
He's telling a story about how fucked up he was so long ago.

05:41.000 --> 05:47.000
Look, Dan Harmon goes to bat for Liam Neeson. Fuck off.

05:47.000 --> 05:55.000
I want us to stop destroying each other. I want the cloud that we're becoming.

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
I don't think any individual is becoming a worse person because of the internet.

05:58.000 --> 06:04.000
How does Liam Neeson know to not tell that story? If that happened...

06:04.000 --> 06:10.000
That's the biggest tragedy of all. The answer is because he felt comfortable and he wanted to confess.

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
What do you want to confess, Dan?

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
That would be great, wouldn't it?

06:15.000 --> 06:19.000
I'm supposed to stand here and say, from now on, forget it.

06:19.000 --> 06:25.000
Every night, I go to bed and I'm like, what am I doing this for?

06:25.000 --> 06:30.000
Up and down, the answer is to keep a gun out of my mouth because if I don't talk my mind into a microphone,

06:30.000 --> 06:35.000
it bounces around inside my skull and it's going to get worse and worse and worse.

06:35.000 --> 06:39.000
Am I doing this for me? Am I doing this for other people? I don't even know anymore.

06:39.000 --> 06:46.000
I know that the day I quit, I can't quit tomorrow because it'll be Dan Harmon quits podcast

06:46.000 --> 06:50.000
and dust up over Liam Neeson's story.

06:50.000 --> 06:54.000
I have to now wait until it's gas prices.

06:54.000 --> 06:58.000
Now we have one more year of me and these ads.

06:58.000 --> 07:02.000
I'm still waiting until it's...

07:02.000 --> 07:08.000
Look, man, I don't think that there's anything that any individual can do

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
because I think that every individual is actually a good person.

07:11.000 --> 07:16.000
The thing that I'm going through right now, I tell my therapist all the time, I'm like, I hate everyone

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
except for anyone I meet.

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
I hate, but none of us are meeting each other.

07:22.000 --> 07:26.000
I hate what we've become. I hate the cloud.

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
I hate this collective behavior.

07:29.000 --> 07:33.000
I said it before when the weatherman was...

07:33.000 --> 07:37.000
He accidentally said the wrong word and stuff like that.

07:37.000 --> 07:43.000
I express the sentiment of out of sympathy for actually the people that get outraged,

07:43.000 --> 07:47.000
all of whom I believe I give them credit as an American.

07:47.000 --> 07:51.000
I bet they don't want the power over whether someone gets fired.

07:51.000 --> 07:57.000
If you and I are on a smoke break out in the sidewalk, what we want to do is talk shit about Liam Neeson.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
We want to like...

07:58.000 --> 08:06.000
And we don't want a fucking drone to monitor what we say and then take it to his publicist and affect his career.

08:06.000 --> 08:10.000
We want to be able to, with all of our primate hearts, go like, that was fucked up.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
I didn't like that. I don't like what he said.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
That's the thing about this.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
We want to be able to wake up the next day and go, yeah, I was talking a lot of shit.

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about. I need to read about it.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
That's true. That's a human trait.

08:22.000 --> 08:27.000
If you level the playing field, though, you can get away with whatever you want.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
What do you mean?

08:28.000 --> 08:33.000
I mean, what makes it difficult is that he spoke about a group of people who were disenfranchised.

08:33.000 --> 08:39.000
But if you lift all the boats with the old tide, then you can talk shit about every boat.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
I still don't know what you mean.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
I know.

08:42.000 --> 08:48.000
I'm not supposed to. I want to know.

08:48.000 --> 08:54.000
Literally, it's like, I love a good black joke if it's super funny because the super funny has lifted the tide

08:54.000 --> 08:59.000
because you are a craftsman who has made a wonderful joke, even at my own expense.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
Something that I love to laugh at myself, right?

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
That's when we're cool.

09:03.000 --> 09:08.000
We're not cool if I'm broke as fuck and you're pointing at me as you make the joke.

09:08.000 --> 09:12.000
So what we want is a world where I can talk shit about women and Jews and gays

09:12.000 --> 09:16.000
because women and Jews and gays are doing so fucking well that even they're like,

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
I am a little weird.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
Right, but how does that sound?

09:21.000 --> 09:28.000
I mean, when Mr. Neeson was making this confession, he was saying like 40 years ago,

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
Bastards.

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
He so didn't want, it was that phrase for sure.

09:32.000 --> 09:37.000
It was alliterative and it was like clickable and it was like...

09:37.000 --> 09:40.000
I wish you would say my name with Bastard behind it to my face.

09:40.000 --> 09:44.000
Now, if you say black in front of that, you kind of say my name

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
because I like to go with Black Brandon some days.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
Black Brandon.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
Oh, Black Brandon.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
I'm a pirate.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
But that's the issue.

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
The issue is, whoa, Black Brandon.

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
I'm a brand new suit on Black and Brandon.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
But that's the game.

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
The game is, if you lift everybody up, you can do whatever fuck you want.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
Joke should always be funny.

10:05.000 --> 10:10.000
If you're going to tell a racial joke, the only rule is it has to be,

10:10.000 --> 10:14.000
you can't lower the status of the target.

10:14.000 --> 10:19.000
If it's funny that the person's black or Jewish or a woman or whatever

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
and they still win, that's a funny joke.

10:22.000 --> 10:27.000
We're using the joke thing as a template because what we understand is jokes

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
and we know that he wasn't making a joke, right?

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
It was Bastard.

10:30.000 --> 10:36.000
It does apply like a rubbing from joke to confession

10:36.000 --> 10:44.000
because in his confession, he didn't lift up while he kind of confessed

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
that he was dehumanizing.

10:46.000 --> 10:51.000
For instance, there's a joke I made on TV once that was aired

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
and it was a funny joke at the time.

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
If I could go back in time, I would erase that from memory

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
because it was not a joke.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
Oh, you have one of those? Aren't you adorable?

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
No, I mean, I'm thinking of one in particular.

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
And it was funny at the time.

11:06.000 --> 11:11.000
If I told that joke today, I think it would be horrible.

11:11.000 --> 11:15.000
And also, I'm sad that I said it once a long time ago.

11:15.000 --> 11:19.000
And could we all retract a thousand things that we said?

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
Absolutely.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
I think that's how everybody...

11:22.000 --> 11:29.000
I mean, maybe I'm unique in that I've kind of aerosoled myself from the age of 23

11:29.000 --> 11:33.000
going, look at me, look at me, look at me, every shit I take, every thought I think.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
Every breath you take?

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
Every move you make?

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
And all darkness and all of the time and all what I could get away with at the time.

11:40.000 --> 11:46.000
It's so much misogyny, so much racism, so much unfashionable thought

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
in a world where it's moving so quickly.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
I am absolutely biased.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
I have an agenda when I call for forgiveness.

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
We've lost our shame on the Internet, which is a good thing,

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
because so much shame needed to be lost.

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
It was being used to hold so many people back.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
But we've also lost our grace, maybe?

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
We've lost our forgiveness.

12:07.000 --> 12:13.000
I mean, we are just recreationally and collectively hurting each other.

12:13.000 --> 12:18.000
There's no call to action because I don't think you or you or you or you or you

12:18.000 --> 12:23.000
or you or any individual, I don't think anyone's actually becoming a bad person.

12:23.000 --> 12:30.000
I think that we're evolving into a collective organism that is doing some terrible things to the individual.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
If we've all chosen a life where we all want everyone to hear us,

12:33.000 --> 12:37.000
they have to hear us be our worst at all times too.

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
And then we have to learn to shut up.

12:40.000 --> 12:47.000
Like, we're asking for followers and we're happy every time we get more followers,

12:47.000 --> 12:52.000
but we're bummed out every time everybody heard us fart or burp or say something

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
that we should have thought twice before we said.

12:55.000 --> 12:59.000
Real clear, it's not the 40 years ago that he was racist.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
It was the current day he was a bastard.

13:01.000 --> 13:07.000
So one of the things in all speeches, we don't mind if you say black hero, black big dick,

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
don't say black bad parent, don't say black bad bot.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
Don't do that.

13:11.000 --> 13:16.000
So with him, had he not said bastard, he just said black dudes would have been on his side.

13:16.000 --> 13:22.000
That's getting really specific because maybe you, did you see the super specific like the way he,

13:22.000 --> 13:26.000
because I'm imagining it again, I'm refusing to click and yet I'm going like,

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
everyone let's just love each other.

13:28.000 --> 13:34.000
But he surely was characterizing himself as an unreliable narrator.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
No, he wasn't saying that word.

13:36.000 --> 13:40.000
You're saying just like, come on, if you don't know how to navigate those waters in general.

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
Yeah, because you say Adderall, Comic-Con.

13:43.000 --> 13:48.000
I would say too many interviews, tired, telling stories, getting too casual.

13:48.000 --> 13:54.000
And he was just like, after my friend got raped, I went out and I wanted to kill the first black bastard that I saw.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
And I went looking for one.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
Is the problem.

13:57.000 --> 14:02.000
The problem is that something happened to someone you knew and it caused you to be predatory.

14:02.000 --> 14:07.000
When the reality is, if that were true, I'd clean this theater out.

14:07.000 --> 14:13.000
Except for gray.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
That's really interesting.

14:15.000 --> 14:19.000
Like you thought that you think like he let down.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
That's what I think happened.

14:20.000 --> 14:24.000
His garden was like almost humble bragging about it.

14:24.000 --> 14:27.000
Like he was asked how he got into character.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
Interesting.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
Really interesting.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
I want to tell you one thing.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
We're going to bring our guest out.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.000
He's been waiting too long.

14:33.000 --> 14:41.000
Ladies and gentlemen, Liam Neeson.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
You do a good Liam Neeson impression.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
Do you want to apologize for Liam Neeson?

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
No, we're not doing that joke.

14:47.000 --> 14:50.000
It won't help anybody.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
That joke is obvious.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
I get it.

14:53.000 --> 14:57.000
They're biological killing machines.

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
We're not connecting those dots.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
But you just did it.

15:02.000 --> 15:05.000
I'm going to tell you in advance until the end of my career,

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
which is obviously going to be shortly,

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
given that it goes back to shit that you've already done.

15:10.000 --> 15:15.000
I'm going to continue to, with absolutely no mistake,

15:15.000 --> 15:22.000
that I'm in the kind of like, that it's not the way to win a popularity contest.

15:22.000 --> 15:27.000
Like I'm going to go with my heart and I'm going to continue to side with the person,

15:27.000 --> 15:32.000
the individual who is currently at that point walking the plank.

15:32.000 --> 15:35.000
I don't care how bad.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
I figure if they're out on the plank,

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
I just want to feel bad for them.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
I don't care what they've done.

15:41.000 --> 15:45.000
I think that may be a lot of projection on my part when I'm just like,

15:45.000 --> 15:48.000
I spent so much time.

15:48.000 --> 15:51.000
I just feel like I've always been that guy.

15:51.000 --> 15:59.000
And I didn't get this far to like, I don't want to like poke people off of that plank.

15:59.000 --> 16:04.000
If they're walking it for a reason, then they're walking off of it.

16:04.000 --> 16:09.000
But anyways, I wanted to say one thing to you.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
Sure.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
You.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
Before we bring our guest out, because I was like,

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
Spencer dropped out.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
So sorry, God loves Spencer.

16:19.000 --> 16:23.000
I was I was I was thinking about the Liam Neeson thing was putting on my me undies,

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
which are three times softer than cotton.

16:25.000 --> 16:28.000
And I was having this like internal monologue in my head.

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
I started thinking about the Michael Richards thing.

16:31.000 --> 16:36.000
And the the weird turning point in the Michael Richards thing for me,

16:36.000 --> 16:41.000
and I swear I'm not being hyperbolic about the personalization of this.

16:41.000 --> 16:45.000
I remember distinctly because this podcast is so goddamn old.

16:45.000 --> 16:50.000
I remember carrying the Michael Richards thing into Harmontown at Melt Town.

16:50.000 --> 16:54.000
And I remember talking to you and DeMorge about it,

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
like talking about it in the green room.

16:56.000 --> 17:00.000
And both of you guys, like my epiphany was like because I was coming and going,

17:00.000 --> 17:03.000
can you fucking believe this?

17:03.000 --> 17:06.000
And the two of you basically going like, yeah.

17:06.000 --> 17:10.000
In a way that was like, yeah, that's the world we live in.

17:10.000 --> 17:14.000
And it flipped my magnetic poles because I was like, that's important.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
That's why I bring this shit up too.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
Because I'm like, what is your hot take?

17:18.000 --> 17:22.000
Do you remember clicking on this Liam Neeson thing and like help me parse it?

17:22.000 --> 17:25.000
Because as a middle-aged white guy, I'm going to be like,

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
they're trying to take our rights away.

17:27.000 --> 17:32.000
I mean, last real quick thing is that remember that he kisses Viola Davis

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
so hard in that movie recently.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
I can't remember what the name of it is.

17:36.000 --> 17:40.000
And there is this thing that black celebrities are saying, which is,

17:40.000 --> 17:44.000
he can't be racist because he is very intimate with Viola Davis in this movie.

17:44.000 --> 17:48.000
So I do think that that was way back in the day and that he does work on himself

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
and that he probably isn't racist.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
It's just he doesn't know how to tell a story to the press.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
Okay, one more thing and then we'll bring our guest out.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
Sure.

17:56.000 --> 18:01.000
Racism, it's a fucking, it's not a blood type.

18:01.000 --> 18:04.000
It's a phenomenon, right?

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
It's not that phenomenon.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
It's like influenza.

18:08.000 --> 18:13.000
You can't eradicate it by finding people with it and burning them.

18:13.000 --> 18:17.000
You maybe can state a purpose.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
You can state a mission statement.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
I'm against influenza.

18:19.000 --> 18:22.000
Your nose is so running, I'm going to kill you.

18:22.000 --> 18:25.000
But if you genuinely are against the principle,

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
you should accept that it's fucking everywhere.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
Just rise the boats.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
If we all do that part, then we don't have to worry about it.

18:31.000 --> 18:34.000
There's shit we need to do to prepare for it, to deal with it.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
No, you just got to rise the boats.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
Just rise the boats.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
I mean, I like this.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
Racism is a spectrum.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
It's a sociological phenomenon.

18:44.000 --> 18:49.000
It happens because it'll happen until the day race stops.

18:49.000 --> 18:52.000
You're severely underestimating the people that it affects.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
But let's bring out that guest.

18:54.000 --> 18:57.000
Okay, let's bring out our guest and get deeper

18:57.000 --> 19:01.000
and either more or less podcast worthy, I don't know.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
He's our new friend.

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
He's soaring up the charts.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
He's currently resided in Portland,

19:08.000 --> 19:12.000
but if ICE has it their way,

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
he won't be in Portland for much longer.

19:14.000 --> 19:17.000
Please welcome Mohanad Elshiki.

19:17.000 --> 19:35.000
What's up Mohanad?

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
Is your mic working?

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
Yeah, it is working.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
We're good.

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
Alright, you're from Libya, Benghazi,

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
which until I researched you this morning,

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
I thought Benghazi was like a made up word

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
we used to hate Hillary Clinton.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
I wish it was.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
It's actually a city in Libya.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
It is a city in Libya.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
It's where I lived.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
It's sometimes filled made up.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
I want to start there.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
You're like the immigration equivalent of,

20:04.000 --> 20:07.000
I'm starstruck because I don't think I've ever known someone

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
that had asylum.

20:09.000 --> 20:12.000
For all the talk we do about asylum.

20:12.000 --> 20:15.000
And I want to talk so much about that.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
So tracing it from,

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
but first I just want to picture

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
because you're growing up

20:21.000 --> 20:24.000
in part of a gigantic blind spot for me.

20:24.000 --> 20:27.000
Childhood in Libya,

20:27.000 --> 20:30.000
you can be comedic, tragic, sad, whatever.

20:30.000 --> 20:33.000
Honestly, this is a funny question you're asking

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
because a lot of people,

20:35.000 --> 20:38.000
when they imagine my child in Libya,

20:38.000 --> 20:41.000
they always go to some war zone.

20:41.000 --> 20:44.000
I'm afraid to tell you what I would picture,

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
but you can imagine.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
I'll tell you the picture.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
The picture is like me being a child soldier.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
I'm going to defend my mom.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
It's like those backgrounds where the road

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
is the same color as the building.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
Exactly.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
You can't tell.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
My childhood was very chill.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
What did the neighborhood look like?

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
If it didn't look like that,

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
my first world xenophobic images,

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
does it look like

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
the Munsters neighborhood?

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
It looks like the Cleavers.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
I don't know what reference to drive.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
Honestly, I look around the land.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
There's some houses that we had that looked the same.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
The structure was more like...

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
It was kind of different

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
because the houses were...

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
We don't have houses built...

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
I don't know how to describe it.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
The material here that people use,

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
it's more like cement.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
This is how I would describe it.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
When I was growing up,

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
when I see someone gets angry on TV,

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
they punch a wall and they get through it.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
In Libya, you can't do that.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
You punch a wall,

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
that's it, you're dead.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
It's like the cement block kind of...

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
Exactly.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
There were a lot of fistles

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
in my house growing up,

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
and then there would be these dents

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
where you found a stud.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
That's why people assumed

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
they were super angry.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
You can't even punch a wall there.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
You start a war, that's what you do.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
When did you leave Libya?

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
I left Libya in 2014,

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
so I was 23 when I left.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
You came straight to

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
LA?

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
No, Portland.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
Initially, I came on

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
an exchange program.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
It was supposed to be for six weeks.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
This is nightmare fuel for me.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
I'm going to use my eye statements.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
I'm not going to say for white people.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
This is nightmare fuel for me.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
You were a special kid,

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
smart, bright.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
I'm assuming I'm identifying

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
with you.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
You're 14, you're in Benghazi.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
People are probably coming up to you

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
and going, hey, you're funny.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
Talk and talk,

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
and you become an exchange student.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
While you're here,

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
here being America,

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
are you getting

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
texts or emails?

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
This is the story leading to your quest

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
for asylum.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
Facebook messages

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
from family.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
Saying.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
When I moved here, I was 23.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
The program was

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
six weeks. That's the whole program.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
It was important to say university.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
After the program was done,

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
I was supposed to go back to Libya.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
That was the whole plan.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
I didn't even pack enough for

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
staying a year or so.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
Then I was getting messages from my family

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
and stuff.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
To give you some background,

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
back home, when the war started,

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
the revolution, the Arab Spring,

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
they started in 2011.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
The countries

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
were like, the Libyans

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
took down the government. There was no

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
government anymore.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
Everything was

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
mixed up.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
I used to work as an interpreter.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
I used to take

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
journalists and stuff.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
I used to take them to the front lines.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
I was a kid.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
I was 20 or so.

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
You had such a facility

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
already.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
I don't want to derail us

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
from this asylum story.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
That's a different fascinating story.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
Your biopic.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
I don't understand any polyglot.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
I don't understand how anybody

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
speaks multiple languages.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
But to be 20,

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
let's just go ahead and derail

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
and talk about that job.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
It was never a job like,

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
this is what I want to do.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
The war started out of nowhere.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
It probably doesn't pay well.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
It sounds like something that may

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
cause trouble.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
I didn't get paid a single dollar for it.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
But you scammed.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
Someone came to you.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
You scammed a little bit.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
You scammed.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
Scam is like a finder's thing.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
You interpret for somebody

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
and then they tip you.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
I was dumb enough to be like,

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
I'm doing this for my country.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
Now I'm like, I should have got

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
money for this shit.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
Take me to the moment

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
when...

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
Who is the harbinger

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
of this gig?

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
The moment

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
where you go from regular guy

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
with no troubles

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
to being an interpreter.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
I used to work in a school

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
that thought English as a second language.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
I approached that school.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
Second?

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
Fuck the world.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
I'm sorry, I don't know.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
Second to Arabic.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
Arabic is better.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
It looks more beautiful.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
When in Rome, I guess.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
When in Libya.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
Ron Funch has called me out on this habit I have.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
I cast too wide a net.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
I asked somebody a meaningful question

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
and then I fucking did it.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
The questions are great. I love them.

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
The interjections.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
It's about me.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
You give me more time to think

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
and I appreciate that.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
I approached that school.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
Do you have people for us

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
that would be interested in doing that?

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
My manager approached me.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
Would you like to do that?

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
What does manager mean?

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
You're a kid.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
I'm the person who owned that school.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
Your school had a manager?

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
No, it wasn't my school.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
When I was 20,

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
I was teaching English.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
I was an employee at that place.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
You speak Arabic.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
You learned English fluently at what age?

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
Like 7.

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
What else? You speak French?

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
No, English and Arabic.

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
You became a teacher teaching English

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
as a second language.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
Your boss, the vice principal of the school,

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
I demoted him.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
I was like, hey, would you like to do that?

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
I was like, yeah.

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
Who are these guys that are out front?

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
Your boss

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
is coming with a clip on time.

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
He's like, hey, Mohamed,

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
you get a real handle on that English, huh?

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
You're teaching it.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
Are they asking you to work for the embassy?

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
That was before the embassy.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
That was just like,

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
hey, we have these journalists

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
who are coming here to cover the revolution.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
They're like everyone.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
They're like, they're like,

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
we need someone to take them

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
to do some interpretation,

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
like the front lines and stuff.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
So it sounds actually not even,

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
it sounds like you said,

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
do this for my country.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
Exactly, I was like, yeah, I would love to help.

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
Because at the time,

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
there was a week when the revolution started,

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
there was no news coverage happening at all.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
And no one outside of Libya knew

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
what happened.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
How can more awareness be a bad thing?

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
Oh, I'm excited.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
I want everyone outside to know what's happening.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
And I want them to capture that

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
correctly.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
Because we're going around the city asking people,

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
and people are not speaking English that well.

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
So they take whatever they assume

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
that they say they're just put down to the news.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
You must have felt like Indiana Jones,

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
like you're finishing writing a hot dog

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
on the blackboard.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
There's a girl blinking, I love you.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
It's written, I love you, it's on her eyelids.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
And then your boss goes like,

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
hey, I'm going to get in, guys.

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
Want to take you, and you're like, god damn it,

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
this is such a romantic, adventurous job.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
Exactly, I was so excited at the time.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
I was like, oh, I'll take them to the front lines.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
That sounds exciting.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
And I did that, we driven

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
for a while and we got in there.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
And there was an area where they were like,

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
you can't go across this line

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
because this is where the actual

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
fighting is happening.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
And journalists are like,

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
let's go across the line.

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
Yeah, so I take them and

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
there were some moments where

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
sometimes they're just like, oh, it's easy job.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
They're asking soldiers and

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
then there's other

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
times where everyone

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
starts running and you have no idea

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
what you're running away from.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
And you just keep going until

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
you just hide behind a car

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
or something. I don't know what's happening.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
Yeah.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
At that time where you like, there's good guys

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
and there's bad guys and I'm just like,

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
at the time there were like good guys and bad guys.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
We knew who the bad guy was.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
But in a year after that, it was just

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
like, bad guys everywhere.

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
And I'm like, maybe I'm a bad guy now.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
You never know what was happening.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
So who's in charge at this point?

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
There's a Magaria, how do you say that name?

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
Who's the...

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
The former president? Yeah, that was Gaddafi.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
Oh, so this is during Gaddafi?

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
Yeah, during Gaddafi, it was like the revolution

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
against him and then he died like

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
10 months after.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
It was like...

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
So how are you seen by the locals?

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
Are you seen as a conspirator?

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
Like with the West?

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
That started to happen after

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
a few years in because

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
I was still doing that job

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
and then that school I was working on

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
there was programs that were sponsored

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
by the US Embassy in Benghazi

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
and we had the

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
ambassador

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
Christopher Stevens

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
who used to come there all the time.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
We were seen as

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
people who worked with the embassy

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
and I'm like a person who did that too.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
So Gaddafi kind of put the spotlight on me.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
Also I used to... Is it because of the bad guy

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
and forgive my ignorance, don't know anything

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
about that conflict or what the result was?

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
Is it the situation that then

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
after you went to be a foreign exchange student

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
that the bad guys...

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
that the guys you perceived as bad

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
let's call it... It became worse

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
after they came here.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
Did they take power? They did take power.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
You're over here

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
learning about quantum physics

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
or whatever.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
I was learning about conflict resolution.

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
That takes us to this moment

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
where you're getting Facebook messages from

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
loved ones. I can't put myself

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
in this situation. I was getting text messages

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
from my mom and stuff and she's like

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
hey, someone

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
came by the house today and they were asking

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
for you and they came through your room

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
and took some of your stuff and whatever

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
they took my stuff and I was like

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
what did they take?

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
By the way, I should interject here for a second

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
because I take this for granted

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
this guy is incredibly funny.

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
He's a great comedian

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
and that's...

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
Even if you were a fireman

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
this would be an interesting story

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
but what's crazy about this

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
is that you still

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
at this stage of this story

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
you haven't yet thought about a career in comedy

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
and as of a couple years ago

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
you're like

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
legitimately like

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
Portland's like

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
people are excited about you

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
because you're that good at stand-up

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
but you weren't

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
you won't say it

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
but that's what's double ironic about it

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
is we have so much to talk about about comedy theory

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
and stuff but first of all to get through this thing

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
I haven't met somebody who's been in this situation

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
Absolutely, that definitely makes sense

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
They went to your house, they went to your room

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
and what were they looking for?

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
Your computer?

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
My computer was with me at the time

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
but they were trying to find stuff

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
that would like tie me to the embassy

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
because that happened after the embassy attack

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
and all of that

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
and also the thing is as a Libyan citizen

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
when you want to come to the US at the time

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
it's like a very very long process

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
because I was accepted in that program

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
I got my visa in like two days

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
or so it was like a very quick thing

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
because they've already done background check

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
and all of that

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
so this guy who we thought worked with the US

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
before

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
went so easily to the US

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
there's no way he's not working for the US

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
That's ironic

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
So they thought you were like special services

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
That's exactly what it is

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
That is incredibly ironic

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
They thought you were intelligence

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
or like secret service stuff

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
Yeah, exactly

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
I was like such a compliment

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
but also at the time

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
Wow, that's amazing

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
Okay, so you're getting these

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
I want to interject here though

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
emotionally and go like

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
because I feel this anxiety

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
even as a person who doesn't even

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
I don't know what your emotional connection is

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
to your family but you're getting

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
messages from back home that are saying

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
they're tossing your room

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
literally tossing your room

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
your bedroom

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
they're looking for

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
reasons to justify

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
making you an enemy of the state

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
while you're sitting over here

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
on a temporary lily pad

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
that is our government's job

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
to either

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
renew like a library

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
book or whatever

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
but what about your

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
family? Are they in danger

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
at that point?

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
Yeah, tossing your room

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
then they're shaking your grandma

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
They eventually had to leave the city

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
they left the house, they left the city

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
they moved to another city because

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
they were like, we can't deal with this city

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
So there's like a city that's more

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
Yeah, they wanted the capsule which is

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
triply they moved there

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
Because you're an intelligent interpreter

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
that has connections in America

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
Exactly, they were like

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
we have more family in that city

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
Is that because of the change of power

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
in Libya?

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
After Gaddafi died?

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
Yes, because there were a lot of

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
religious extremism

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
It became sort of a free-for-all

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
Yeah, exactly, because there was

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
the Libyan military and then you have

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
groups that were like

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
You had Wolf Blitzer's stink on you

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
Wolf Blitzer touched you as a baby bird

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
Exactly, and then

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
after the embassy attack happened and everything

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
it became even worse there

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
because these people were like

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
the embassy attack was a statement as if

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
we're in power, we can do whatever

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
the fuck we want so

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
these people were more and more in power

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
and

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
and then after I came here

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
getting all these messages and stuff

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
Did I feel terrified?

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
Did I feel bad?

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
Not really, because

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
I've had worse stuff happen

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
when I was there, so I was like

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
it was like a mental state where I was

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
in like no matter what happens

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
I'm like, okay, yeah, I guess there's

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
something we have to deal with

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
What's the worst stuff?

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
The worst stuff is just like

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
not twice before

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
the radio station I used to work for

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
because I used to host a radio show

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
like was burned down to the ground

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
because they were like not into

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
what we were saying or stuff

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
Why would you be shot out in your car?

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
Were you being targeted?

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
Yeah, I was getting a lot of death threats even when I was

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
being gutted at the time

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
How did people know you?

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
They had seen you walking around with

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
Yeah, absolutely, I mean like people get like

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
You're a voice of opposition

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
or were you even at all?

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
It wasn't an opposition, it was more of like

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
okay, so we have no government now

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
what's going to be like the face of the new country

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
and most of the opinions that

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
me and my co-host had

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
were too western as they described them

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
and when I say western

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
they were just like

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
yeah, we want to accept religion from government

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
like we want this and we want that

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
We should try that here

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
I keep having this like crazy

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
like this high-pitched tournament

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
like your family's safe

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
now in quotes

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
just so we can continue to talk about this

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
No, they're safe, they're good

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
which is focused on you, I just keep thinking of this family

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
they're like Facebooking you and going

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
yeah, they touched your room and like okay, so they relocated

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
and they're safe

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
because the story of you then

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
because I'm a narcissist so all I do

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
is put myself in your shoes and think about what if it was me

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
and then I just want to puke until I die

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
like going like

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
what? Everyone hate

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
like they're trying

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
so you apply for asylum

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
in the United States

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
and as the policy is

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
they go okay, we'll look into that

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
and how

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
describe that process?

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
yeah, so when you apply for an asylum

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
it's a very lengthy process

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
once you apply

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
first it's very expensive

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
to do so

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
if you want to

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
mark one wrong box

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
or something like that, that can affect the whole process

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
so they're like

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
you have to hire a lawyer

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
that's like three grand or something just to hire a lawyer

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
just to fill your papers and stuff

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
and like a person who's like new to this place

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
I'm like okay

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
I'm just gonna like toss like three grand to them

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
and then every time they're like

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
asking for more papers and everything costs

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
money and you have to pay fees and stuff

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
so you keep going

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
totally ignorant of this

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
is there a channel of

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
is asylum a legitimate channel

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
for people of means

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
because they can just afford it

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
maybe Harrison Ford doesn't have to stand in line at the DMV

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
with me

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
is there

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
or are rich people just, they don't need asylum

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
there's no way to cut

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
rich people

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
they start a business and get a green card

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
this is how they do it

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
and I wasn't a person who couldn't afford it

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
but I was in the middle

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
so I could afford the lawyer

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
afforded to do it the right way

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
and not make mistakes and that's it

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
so

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
when you talk about these steps

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
where you're going through where I'm like oh my god

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
my heart is skipping beats

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
every time you go through one of these cycles

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
there's countless

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
thousands of people who

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
had to give up at that point because

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
they had to find a lawyer

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
one reason people give up

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
and that makes sense to me is that

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
the first eight months after you apply for an asylum

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
you're not allowed to work

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
you can't have a legal job

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
so you just have to find ways to make money

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
that's such a funny thing to me

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
funny in the air quotes

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
like the idea of like oh wait

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
someone's going to kill you

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
I don't believe you

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
I think you're here to sell peanuts

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
if I catch you selling a single peanut

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
instead of fearing for your life

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
you have to have connections

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
and someone

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
you have to have some lifeline

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
to take care of you

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
it's like being a PA in Hollywood

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
it's like a simultaneous oppression

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
and privilege

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
where it's like you can't even

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
qualify to be mistreated unless your parents are rich

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
who is taking care of you family from back home

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
or what

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
I had to transfer all of the money I had

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
back home to the US

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
and kind of start spending that money

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
and then I had to get like under the table

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
jobs and stuff like work for a food cart

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
or like do this and that

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
to prove to our government that you're not here

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
to

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
fuck around like you're actually here

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
and you can survive

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
without a job

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
but you're not allowed to work

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
or you're proving that you're here to steal a job

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
this is the reason I believe they're doing that

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
it's mostly to be like

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
if you're serious about being here you'll find

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
ways because this is the American

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
dream is to struggle or whatever

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
because you know how everyone

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
is born here to have to do that

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
yeah

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
we just lied about our cotton expertise

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
and we got free rides

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
you paid no rent

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
you paid no rent

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
yeah you got free meals

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
you should try it you know anything about tobacco

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
110 degree weather

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
happy february

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
I'm so excited

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
I'm doing black history for my workout

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
I'm learning about so many black history

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
and after 300 years you got your visa

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
that's right

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
oh my god and then in 1940

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
women got theirs

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
isn't that great

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
I don't want to get too political or anything

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
but it almost sounds

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
like what you're describing doesn't define

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
the word asylum

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
it sounds like the idea

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
the original idea behind that word

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
is like

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
it's almost like a believe the victim

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
thing

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
maybe I'll

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
book somebody that

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
works in some

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
office it's not going to be an ice agent

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
it's not going to be

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
maybe there's someone on the other side of the issue that can tell me

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
oh god if we open those floodgates

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
but I just have this weird sneaking suspicion that

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
there is absolutely not a zero sum

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
game going on here where if

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
everyone who came to your borders

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
said

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
I'm going to die

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
I'm scared I'm going to die or I'm already in your country

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
and I'm scared to go back home

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
if we said to all of those people

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
okay well alright

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
here you go rubber stamp

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
that what would happen

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
would be the destruction of America

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
I just choose to not believe that

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
see the thing is

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
if they put more

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
means and more money into the process

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
of making that a fast process

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
that will help

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
they do a lot of

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
background check and stuff

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
but in my case for example

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
you're worried about me maybe

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
being not a good person

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
I'm going to do this in this country

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
I hate for you to just shock up on a trailer

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
and make like eight kids and eat seven of them

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
so

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
although as a listener of true crime

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
I'd have to say

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
you're as welcome to do that as anybody

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
true equality

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
true equality

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
statistics bear out

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
but it's just so crazy to me because I'm like

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
okay so you're going to apply for an asylum

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
eight months no job

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
so maybe you can do it illegally

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
we don't know do your thing

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
and then you got to work permit

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
and then wait for four years

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
to have an interview so we can decide

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
based on the story that you tell us

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
if you're being honest or not

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
now in those four years I'm here

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
I could have plotted so many things

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
against the U.S.

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
if you think I'm a dangerous person

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
how many did you

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
I started a career in stand-up comedy

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
so that's one thing

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
that is a bit of a plot against the U.S.

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
I mean you're bumping a lot of J.Morris

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
you're going to destabilize the comedic industry

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
yeah exactly

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
people actually look

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
that's the question isn't that four years

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
are Americans actually looking

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
in your home country to see if anything's ever gone down

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
do they really spend that time well

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
after I did my

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
interview with the immigration officer

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
I realized they know nothing

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
and they were like you tell us everything

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
from the beginning it was three hours

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
and a half or just interview questions

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
and them being like so Libya

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
okay tell us more about that

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
I'm like what have you been doing for the past

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
four years that's a little bit of relief to me

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
as an interviewer I'm like

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
you know Libya you bomb that place

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
sorry

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
bombing doesn't mean knowing about

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
nope

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
I'm a child of the 80s

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
if you're

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
my parents paid for the bombing

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
I bet they can't point to it on a map

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
now you had a run in

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
recently and spoke in Washington

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
are you sick of talking about this story

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
no we can talk about it

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
it's a natural segue

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
that's the thing it's almost a shame

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
it's like

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
all this stuff

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
this struggle and stuff but it's also

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
if it were a strictly comedy

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
podcast and we were like hey

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
who's this new uprising comedy star

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
you're very funny

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
and it's incredibly

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
interesting the idea that you were this funny

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
given how recently

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
according to my hour of research

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
of you on Wikipedia

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
and I said to you in the green room

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
is that an exaggeration

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
it was like four years ago

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
somebody said to you in the height of this

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
like pressure where you're like

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
I was here in asylum

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
I was an interpreter and now I'm like

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
here's studying this and that and then it's like

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
oh shit

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
ticking clock I may have to go back

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
I don't know when and someone said

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
to you

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
you should try comedy

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
yeah it was in college

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
because I was taking a public

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
speaking class at the time

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
and then at the end of the term my public speaking

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
professor was like have you tried

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
comedy and I was like

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
yeah I know some open mics can show you

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
where to go and I was like yeah let's

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
do this and then at the end I was like

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
oh this is a good profession

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
yeah I can yell at people

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
on a mic that sounds cool

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
this is the point where if we could play a clip

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
if we were a TV show in the

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
90s or something

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
so that people could

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
rest assured

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
you're very graceful and funny on stage

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
you do these things and honestly

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
I was telling you in the green room

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
I watched your one set and I was like

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
I wanted to dig in with you about the minutia

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
of what you're doing

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
on stage because

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
I

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
I tried to do stand up from

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
17 to god knows when I really hung it up

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
but like it is an art

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
that it like

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
here you are English as a second language

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
and you're on stage and you

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
there's really specific things that you do

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
like where you let the audience

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
not do anything

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
you're doing a stand up set in Portland

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
and you have this bit that's like

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
where it's just like

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
it's very

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
resonant because you're like the T

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
up is just you talking about like gun rights

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
and that the setup is that you

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
so I tweeted like oh I don't

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
think that gun rights is that I can't remember the setup at all

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
but it's provocative enough

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
that I would never trust

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
an audience to not

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
fuck everything

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
up by reacting either positively

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
with applause or booing

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
or haram thing and you just let it

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
sit so patiently

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
yeah and then

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
it makes your punchline so funny because

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
it all it is is like the joke is like you go

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
you tweet this thing and it's like

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
a gun control

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
thing it's basically like I don't think

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
guns should be this or that or whatever

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
what's the joke yeah let's hear this

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
well if you don't feel

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
yeah I can I

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
professional no I can do it

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
I'm good I mean I know when people

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
tell when people tell me to do

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
my Sean Connery impression I'm like

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
no I can't do it because you asked

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
let's hear you Sean Connery most things

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
down here don't react well to bullets

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
okay all right well whatever but it's like

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
if you if you if you work

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
well under pressure I'll tell you the joke

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
yeah yeah yeah so

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
so yeah we

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
we live in such a weird time because a lot

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
of people have

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
opinions

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
you know and have you seen those

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
yeah they're there

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
and

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
especially about stuff like guns for example

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
because a lot of people have opinions

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
about that and mostly everyone is

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
wrong

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
and I as a comedian like every time a shooting

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
happen or something I have to go on social media

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
and I have to like tweet something clever

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
you know to like raise awareness

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
that I exist

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
and

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
last time a shooting happens I just went

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
and I tweeted and I wrote that we shouldn't be

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
sending thoughts and prayers and we should

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
be praying for more gun control

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
which to me sounded

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
like a very logical statement

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
to post on the internet

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
with the name mohaned

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
and I believed in everything I said

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
until that guy Kevin

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
replied to me

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
you guys know Kevin

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
yeah from social media

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
yeah he's there too

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
and Kevin replied to me this is what Kevin said

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
and I quote

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
you fucking Muslim

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
I eat bacon 24

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
7

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
which is quite impressive

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
I was like man I don't

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
eat bacon but I think that's super unhealthy

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
also probably

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
the worst argument

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
against gun control

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
just shouting your favorite food at me

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
yeah Kevin is dead now

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
it's that pause

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
that's the thing that I focus on is the

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
it's the pause

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
where you describe your tweet because I live

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
in the cynical world where

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
whatever I think of

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
Portland I don't even know

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
I was like I'm watching from Los Angeles

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
watching the YouTube clip of you

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
in front of 100 people in Portland

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
and I don't know what's going through

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
your head when you're willing

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
to go so I tweeted

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
thoughts and prayers

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
and a while

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
I've become so jaded

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
so cynical that

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
I'm like I would never ever

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
I gotta I can't

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
I can't let this rest happen because

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
someone will

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
fuck it up can you talk about that

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
did you vet that

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
silence?

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
I mean the silence exists there for a reason

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
because some of the jokes I do

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
people would do that

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
someone would jump in

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
or just say something stupid

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
and ruin the whole thing

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
but I've done it a few times to see

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
that silence makes it even better

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
and

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
I think it's mostly because of the way

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
I say it because I talk very slowly

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
and stuff

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
and I get the impression there's something else coming out

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
so people

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
on the edge to see what's gonna come next

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
so no one will interrupt the silence

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
and I think

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
the setup of someone else says it

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
it would be more like yeah

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
but when I say

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
I don't know where this is going

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
but I wanna hear it

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
that's gotta be like

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
that's so Portland

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
is there a place in the states

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
that you can do comedy in Arabic?

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
no

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
I would never do comedy in Arabic

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
have you ever tried Arabic?

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
I can tell stories in Arabic

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
but the structure of setup punchline

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
is such a foreign concept

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
to Arabic language that if you did it

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
people were like why are you quiet

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
why did you stop?

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
for real I never thought of that

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
is there any stand up culture

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
in Arabic?

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
there is in some countries

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
like Lebanon

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
if you go to

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
it's more getting more recognized

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
but everything I've seen was more storytelling

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
and I think it has to do with Arabic language

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
it's more like

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
you have to keep going

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
and it has to be

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
long stories

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
so you can't just do setup punchline

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
like pauses

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
like traditional

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
American style

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
setup punchline

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
absolutely because this is a way

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
I've learned how to talk in English that way

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
when I did it here

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
because when I speak in Arabic

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
I never talk this way

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
I talk way faster

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
when you speak Arabic

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
even when I'm telling a funny story in Arabic

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
it's always full of energy

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
and talking way faster

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
is it politically incorrect to go

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
even though we won't understand it

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
I just want to hear you tell a story really fast

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
in Arabic

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
is that a weird

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
bar joke

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
like a straight up joke joke

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
like a guy goes into a bar

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
and the bartender says whatever

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
well we don't have bars

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
it's already funny

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
like a proper

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
straight up

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
I'm trying to think

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
it was like a story I would say out loud

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
but I don't know maybe you can give me a few sentences

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
I can say them in Arabic

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
give me a joke

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
a guy goes into a doctor's office

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
and the doctor says

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
a guy

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
will be an interpreter

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
and he'll be

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
pretend I'm Arabic

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
even though I can't understand it

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
and translate his

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
because I have to go to the same speed as he

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
you want to click one?

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
a guy is getting his annual physical

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
and the doctor

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
looks at his chart and says

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
I'm afraid you're going to have to stop masturbating

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
the guy says why

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
the doctor says because I'm trying to give you a physical

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
what is

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
what is Ted Koppel saying

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
to me

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
I don't understand

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
tell that joke in Arabic

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
wait no

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
you were done

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
is that a notable thing

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
that there wasn't

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
a big fucking

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
this at the end

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
people can just follow with you

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
is that a culture thing

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
do you know the difference

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
between Dubai

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
and Abu Dhabi

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
absolutely

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
that's a joke

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
there are two different cities

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
tell me the joke

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
people

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
I'm surprised you don't know this

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
people from Dubai

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
do not like the Flintstones

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
but people from Abu Dhabi do

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
feels good

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
tell that in Arabic

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
don't

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
don't

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
let me be the angel on your shoulder

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
I do want to ask though

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
because I'm fascinated with

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
it's a fucking good joke

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
it's a good joke

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
don't be defiant about it

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
it might be or it might not be

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
I hated that joke so much

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
welcome to Dubai

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
arguably

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
but the

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
polyglots

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
they make me feel ashamed

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
they're still laughing at my joke

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
the joke is still washing over him

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
he still loves it

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
I always want to know

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
this idea of

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
do you think in one language and translate it to another

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
you said something in the green room

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
I think I've heard it before

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
from other people that are bilingual

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
you said there was a transition

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
tell me

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
for the first few years here

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
I would speak in English but I would talk in Arabic

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
I always had that transition

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
when you tell me something

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
it goes into that fast process

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
from English to Arabic to Arabic to English

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
now I'm at the point

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
where I even have my dreams in English

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
I would be like I'm fully gentrified now

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
so it changes

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
that's the thing

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
when you learn a language

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
when you start dreaming in the other language

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
that means your brain has completely

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
absolutely and now it's very strange

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
because when I talk to my parents

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
and obviously we talk in Arabic

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
sometimes I find myself

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
being like

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
what's that word

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
who are you

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
do you think

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
is that uncomfortable to talk about

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
tell me stop at any time

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
but what is that relationship like

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
you are after all an astronaut

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
that came over

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
the asylum thing happened

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
you haven't been back since right?

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
emotionally

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
is there any

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
does that generate any conflict?

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
it's definitely hard

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
I do miss them a lot

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
it's very hard on them too

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
because

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
in living culture

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
you live as a family

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
together

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
you don't leave the house until you get married

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
there's no like oh he's going to college

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
now you leave

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
everyone lives together in a big house

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
there's family structure

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
so were you kind of starting to rewind

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
to your childhood then

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
were you a freak

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
were they like

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
what's up with Mahanad

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
he's like so weirdly verbal

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
or

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
just in comparison

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
of that

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
was there a departure

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
in your childhood

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
was there a point where

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
where there was this conversation

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
about

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
you're going to keep

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
talking because you're a talker

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
yeah

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
I mean

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
my parents

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
their thing with me

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
is they would always be like

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
hey do whatever you want

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
you can talk about whatever but can you tone it down

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
a bit

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
so resonant

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
sometimes my mom

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
I would be outside of the house and I post something on facebook

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
and she immediately calls me

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
I'm like delete this right now

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
did they speak english too or just you

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
what's that

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
did your family speak english as well

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
my siblings do none of my parents do

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
they kind of understand it

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
but they've never learned english

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
they made sure that me and my siblings

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
were learning english

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
since we were super young

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
but they don't really speak it that well

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
are you allowed to go back home right now

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
because that's part of the whole

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
asylum process and getting the green card

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
I cannot go back until I become a citizen

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
in a few years

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
because your whole case is built on the fact

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
that oh it's too dangerous for me to go back

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
so if you go back

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
you're kind of like oh have you been lying this whole time

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
on your asylum set

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
even if it gets better

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
you have to be a citizen

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
all the people coming from Venezuela and Central America

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
that are coming in and seeking asylum

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
the same thing for them too

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
but they don't have the resource for

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
lawyers and

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
they do not

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
and obviously the immigration

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
will give you a lawyer and that lawyer is handling 100 cases

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
so there's so many

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
and even with the lawyer

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
even with everything

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
the process is very vague

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
because

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
when I applied

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
they were like okay so when do I do my interview

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
and they were like

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
a few months a year, two years

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
and then it was four

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
so there was like no

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
you're just living in a limbo

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
okay do I start my life

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
and they're like where do I just have to wait

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
I don't know

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
well I

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
I finished like I did

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
the biggest step was getting your asylum approved

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
which I did in last October

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
which was great because it was such a relief

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
because I was like I'm doing comedy

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
and doing all of that but not knowing

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
if I'm like because if they declined it

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
it was just like it's like

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
okay well you either

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
have to pay more money and hire a lawyer again

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
and do all of that or you're welcome to leave

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
so there was that

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
so when it got approved I was like okay

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
okay this is good

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
so you're good to go now

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
well now yeah and next I told

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
but I get my green card which is great

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
so I can come and go out and travel

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
and like do all of that

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
and then in three years from now

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
I do become a citizen

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
but to make no mistake about it

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
and sorry if this is like insensitive

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
or whatever but this is just me

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
going like

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
I just

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
I'm putting myself in these shoes

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
like

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
so there are points in your life

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
and I don't know how long they are

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
and I don't know how extreme the walls of it are

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
but like you have to legitimately fear

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
the idea that you're going to get a letter

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
whether it's pink stationery

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
or a knock on the door

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
it's some bureaucratic thing

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
that's going to go

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
you get it now it didn't work

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
you're going back and you're going to be like

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
on an airplane

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
and you're on the airplane and not only

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
the airline travel is garbage

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
even if you're first class

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
these people hate me

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
and they love flaunting it with their sarcastic applause

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
but you're like legitimately

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
because I mean like

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
you have to atone

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
with a

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
death in your head

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
that someone would go

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
that you would

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
be sent back

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
and you would get to an airport

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
which everyone that's traveled knows

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
you're not in control of your life

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
because that's their airports

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
you can't just like jump off a plane

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
like Arnold Schwarzenegger and be like

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
I'm going to run through the swamp

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
like there's no

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
you come through a gate it's all controlled

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
and anyone that wants to

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
once you're in that country

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
please

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
unless you're uncomfortable talking

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
how high was that fear

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
of going back to a place

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
where people will put a black bag

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
over your head or am I being ignorant

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
or likely

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
that's sadly was the case too

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
yeah like do you like

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
how long do you live in fear of that happening

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
and how much do you currently fear that

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
now not as much

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
now and not because I have my asylum

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
approved and stuff so it's like illegal

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
to even like be like oh you get deported

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
unless you like

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
commit like a criminal

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
like huge like criminal offense or something

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
then you're like you're safe

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
but like yeah even like

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
the past few years

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
there was a fear like I would say from

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
2014

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
to 2016

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
you know what I'm going

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
we're in dates, random dates I don't know why

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
you know what I'm going with that

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
and then until

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
okay I'm still like good and then

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
there was a change

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
in the office

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
yeah and then it became like

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
it went like from 40

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
to 100

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
but I'm sure you're

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
I'm sure that's a figment of your imagination

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
because I have I'm absolutely

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
positive that you have no real world

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
evidence that anything actually

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
changed from day to day

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
after all you were already in America

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
for all those years

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
and then that election happened

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
and you're a smart guy

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
and you're walking around with your papers

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
and you're funny and your Portland's finest

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
and you're just strutting your thing

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
and you got your asylum

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
and nothing can happen to you

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
that's what I show goodnight everybody

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
happy ending

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
can we take it to Spokane now

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
yeah let's do that

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
yeah exactly yeah so

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
I don't know does anybody know this story about what happened to him

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
it's pretty wild

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
yeah I'll tell you the story

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
most of these people are like what the fuck is Spokane

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
yeah

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
it's a trash place

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
like it's really bad

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
by the way do you want to drink

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
she don't lie she don't lie

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
she don't lie

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
Spokane

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
oh there's a song too

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
okay okay

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
when you're bored of shit

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
drown in your own spit

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
Spokane

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
hell yeah

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
no yeah

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
so yeah as you said

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
yeah I got my asylum approved

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
and then I was like oh everything is perfect right now

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
like this guy is untouchable

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
like he talked to me like you're on my paper

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
it's like getting 70 episodes

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
on your show

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
Dan stop making it about you

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
4chan can't stop me now

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
well

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
tap that hornest nest again

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
yeah very relatable

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
like yeah 70 episodes

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
yeah tell me more

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
never had an episode

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
that's my one talent I've been putting my heart to make everything about me

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
no no

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
you're uh

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
so yeah

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
no I

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
yeah no I recently got

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
like a college gig

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
it was in Pullman Washington

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
which is like Spokane what is that

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
like no one knows what that is

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
just a very small college town

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
and they're like hey you want to come perform

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
like an event I was like yeah sure

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
I'll come and do it

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
so I took the bus to get there

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
because it's like

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
by bus it was like 5 to 6 hours

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
because it was snowy so I'm not going to drive

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
I got there

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
I did my set on Saturday

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
it went really well

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
alright

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
don't look it up

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
it went great it was amazing

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
he's a good comic and also all college crowds

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
are a gimme

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
it was really bad

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
it was

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
you should really

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
did you bomb or did the audience

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
just not dig it

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
it was like so the crowd

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
was like mostly students and then I discovered

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
that most of them were like promised extra

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
credit if they attend

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
so I was talking to a crowd of people

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
who were looking at their phones and not even

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
looking at me and I did 10 minutes

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
of material like to like just

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
no one and they were like

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
it was like a full room too

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
and then I sat on the stage

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
and they just started interviewing people

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
like where are you from that's trash

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
just like an old man you know

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
and they just like started yelling at people and stuff

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
and they laughed a bit at that

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
and then yeah so I did my set

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
I got paid everything I was like okay yeah I'm going to leave this town

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
and they never got coming back

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
you get back on that safe ass bus

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
yeah I got on the bus

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
then we had to do a bus transfer

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
in Spokane so that was the reason I was there

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
I had to wait for three hours

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
then I get I get on the bus

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
the bus is here on time which is great

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
I get on the bus just sitting in the back

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
looking at my phone and stuff

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
and then these two people in uniform

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
like come in and they

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
just like start walking around and then like

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
but the bus stops are you back that up though

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
the bus stops somewhere specific

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
before these guys get on

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
no it was at the Greyhound station so we haven't left yet

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
he's transferred in Spokane

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
yeah exactly and it's like

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
I've never traveled by bus

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
God forbid

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
there's still time

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
it's like

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
if you're going an eight hour trip

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
do you tend to just sit there and it stops at Greyhound station

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
yeah and then you wait

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
you sit in the shitty station

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
but you don't get off the bus if you're just

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
shaking the whole trip

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
so first bus from

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
Portman to Spokane

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
and then left that bus

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
because that bus doesn't go all the way to Portman

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
it only goes to Spokane and then

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
waited in the station for three hours

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
and then the other bus came that was going to

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
Portland

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
so yeah just like I don't know flights

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
it was like a transit kind of thing

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
I just want to contextualize like

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
these guys getting on the bus

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
are they getting on the bus before a trip starts

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
before the trip started

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
so everyone sat

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
looking at

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
at random people and I can

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
vaguely hear what they were saying

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
and then they came to me and I was like

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
oh they're probably asking for IDs

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
they're trying to match your ID with your ticket

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
it's fine

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
because they're cracking down on the

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
bus ticket counterfeit ring

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
Greyhound

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
but seriously

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
in that moment

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
you think these guys work for Greyhound?

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
yes absolutely

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
so Greyhound

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
this is how it works

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
traveling by bus is amazing

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
why would Greyhound let

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
why would they not divert funding

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
into having what do they look like

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
describe them they look like

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
they were like big

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
they're like buff guys and they're just like

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
wearing uniforms and stuff

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
and they were like can we see an ID

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
and I was like here you go

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
this is my ID

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
are they skipping people?

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
they asked four people

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
to be specific

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
are you noticing

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
the people

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
they asked looked vaguely

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
ethnic

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
they're skipping over people

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
this person looks Hispanic

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
they asked me

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
I gave them my ID

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
I was like do you need my ticket

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
they were like are you

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
a US citizen

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
that's such a weird thing for them to ask

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
I was like no

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
I'm not and they were like

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
what's your country of citizenship

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
I was like Libya and they were like

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
come with us

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
and I was like

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
took you off the bus

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
I still had no idea who these people were

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
you hadn't identified themselves

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
they didn't say anything when they came

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
into the bus they said nothing

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
they took two people

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
and then the fourth person

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
they asked him if he was a citizen

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
and they were like prove it

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
he pulled his US passport

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
I was like that's very

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
weird

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
so all the other people passed

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
the check

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
is what you're saying

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
they looked at them and they passed

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
some of the people they have a proof of citizenship

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
they had like driver's licenses

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
exactly and they were like

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
that's cool

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
sometimes you can look at a person and they're like

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
I'm from Libya and I have a silo

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
and they're like

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
off the bus

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
we still haven't even mentioned the asylum part yet

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
because I got out they were like

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
do you have any other form of ID

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
I was like yes

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
I'm a comic book nerd

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
in panel 14 of issue 3

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
because I'm picturing these guys in a certain way

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
and I'm wondering

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
so if they're facing you

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
and you're on a bus

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
and then they're like you're coming off the bus

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
as they turn their back

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
following them do you not see

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
this logo on the back

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
is that or am I just

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
doesn't it say ice on the back

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
well here's the thing

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
I thought

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
they were like

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
CBB which was like

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
Border Patrol something

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
they're both under homeland security so they work

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
together

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
these two agents were from

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
that separate agency

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
which is I'll get to that part too

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
because that was like very interesting on the internet

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
but

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
so I got out with them and they were like

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
do you have any other proof of identification

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
I was like yeah I do have my work permit

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
it's still valid

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
it's issued by you guys

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
I just want to interject one thing because of social anxiety

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
and resonating with you

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
are you the only person they pulled off the bus

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
they pulled two other people

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
they were like interviewing separately

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
because they were like at least six

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
my anxiety starts mounting

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
meeting

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
everyone on the bus was there

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
that idea of like oh I'm

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
a bad person

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
and they're like the bus is now going

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
like come on

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
I'm trying to go to

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
I just wanted to give

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
a picture of like if it's just you

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
no absolutely yeah it was me and then

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
two other people who were on the side

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
and then they were like

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
I gave them my work permit like here you go

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
and at that point I was like

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
they work for immigration

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
immigration officers this is like what I can

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
see now

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
and then I gave them my card

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
and they looked at it and they were like

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
what's your status I was like

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
yeah I have an asylum approved this is my status

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
and then they were like do you have your asylum approval on you

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
and I was like

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
why would I have it on me that's such a weird thing

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
I was like it's three pages with a big card

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
and I was advised

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
by your office

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
not to carry it with me

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
I want asylum

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
exactly I was like this is

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
because it's mostly electronic

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
you can like look it up and then show it to them

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
and that's if you don't need to carry a paper with you

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
if you genuinely have asylum

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
you have a place to keep your asylum papers

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
exactly

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
if you're walking around with all your papers

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
just a file cabinet

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
just like walking around like everything

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
is here

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
so what happens next

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
so I gave it to them

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
and then I was like I don't have it

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
but I do have these papers

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
and they were like these can be easily falsified

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
I was like what

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
I was like this work permit is

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
fraud proof like you can't

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
you can't do that I was like since 2011

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
you guys updated it

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
and you can't change it anymore

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
I was like yeah I read your website

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
almost every day

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
and they love you now

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
they hated me so much

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
because you're verbal

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
they were like

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
they were like really not into me

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
because the reason they

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
target Greyhound bus is a very cheap bus

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
so most of the people who use it

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
are like

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
people like

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
a lot of people of color use it in the area

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
a lot of people who are like immigrants, Hispanic

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
and stuff they use it so they know

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
where to target they're not going to like

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
go on some fancy bus that's just like

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
wealthy white people inside of it

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:20.000
that would be inconvenient

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
so they're there to rumble you

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
because these are

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
ICE officers?

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
so CBB, yeah there are two organizations

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
that both of them work together

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
they basically do the same

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
job, yeah they're both

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
horrible

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
they think you falsified your papers

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
they give your stuff back right?

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
Cell not giving me my stuff back

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
they were like holding to them

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
you took your cell phone?

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
no they didn't take my cell phone

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
they had my papers

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
and I was like

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
they kept using the word

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
legal

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
and every sentence that comes out of my mouth

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
they were like yeah legal say that all the time

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
no matter what I say

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
that's probably very true

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
exactly

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
I say something and they're like yeah we've heard that before

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
I'm like what?

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
whatever

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
it feels in your story structure

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
get us every time

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
cause that second act

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
that made us let him go

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
looks like we got us a talker

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
we got a

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
hold your fucking horses T.S. Elliott

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
definitely look like an Elliott for sure

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
part of your story that I saw on twitter was

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
like

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
like the

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
point where you have spoken

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
your case

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
misunderstandings whatever

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
let's do an NPR segment

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
about what they're going through

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
and what they're profiling and whatever

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
I'd be shockingly sympathetic

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
to whatever the fuck is going on

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
but you have said

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
I have this, I have that

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
and they call it in

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
and you can hear

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
it was like a woman's voice on the other side

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
they were reading numbers out of my

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
work permit

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
status and stuff

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
and I can hear it on the phone

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
they were like okay so it's in the system

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
okay yeah

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
and then looked at me and was like yeah there's no records

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
of that

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
now what was that?

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
let's focus in on that

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
at that point I was like

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
really frustrated

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
throughout the whole thing

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
I was like being calm

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
cause I'm like you know what

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
this is inconvenient but once they make their calls

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
and they see that I'm like in the system

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
just take my papers and go

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
my mind races as a middle aged white guy

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
and an oppressor and all this stuff

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
and I go okay zoom in

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
if I figure out how to be this guy

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
and I go okay I don't like to admit

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
making a mistake

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
I'm embarrassed, I'm flustered

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
is that what that is?

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
it felt that way but also like

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
it felt like they're trying to break me at that point

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
they're like okay if we can't get you on that

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
we're gonna get you on something different

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
the story is that do you think that they thought

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
if they bluffed you would eventually go

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
okay I masterminded 9-11

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
or do you think

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
that they were like going

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
one doesn't just

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
get out of this valley with a ladder

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
one needs to create a beach

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
I honestly think it was like both

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
from what I read and stuff

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
they do that to people so they can break down

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
and just say they've done something

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
or whatever

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
and also that they're not gonna make it easy

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
they're like wanna leave you

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
with like

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
yeah don't fuck with us

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
have your everything on you next time

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
we're not to be played with

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
and I

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
they were talking to one another

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
but I didn't hear what they were saying

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
because they would whisper to one another

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
and I'm like okay whatever

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
and then

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
once they told me that I have no records

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
and I was like there's no way

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
I was like you know what

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
you've

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
I think what you're doing now is illegal

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
and if you don't give me my papers back

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
I need, I'm gonna call my lawyer

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
I'm gonna pursue legal action this is like getting too much

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
there you go

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
this is a terrifying threshold

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
and even at that like

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
very calmly because

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
how did that register in their eyes when you said that

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
oh I'm sure they loved it

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
immediately once I finished that sentence

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
the officer that hasn't spoken

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
the whole time started yelling at me

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
with my hands out of my pocket

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
wow

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
by the way what temperature is it

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
it was like freezing cold

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
and they were like wearing gloves and stuff

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
and the thing is like I had them in for 20 minutes

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
now you decided

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
you're hanging out there

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
you're both detonators are ready to go

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
exactly

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
at this point

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
no blasters

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
I mean for you to like

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
you're gonna actually put more effort

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
you say hey

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
what you're doing is illegal I'll lawyer up

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
and they now are treating you like you might have a weapon on you

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
exactly so I immediately

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
I have watched enough documentaries to know where this is going

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
and I took my hands out of my pocket

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
I'm like here on my hand I kept them out

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
and then for two minutes I said nothing

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
because at that point it was like no matter what I say

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
it's gonna be like

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
it's quicksand you move more and you go down more

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
yeah they were like looking at me and I'm just like

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
not even looking at them at this point I'm just like looking around and stuff

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
this is where I want to like focus in though

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
yeah like guy

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
46 year old white guy huge blind spot

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
doesn't know didn't know until tonight

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
that Benghazi is in Libya etc etc

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
all of this stuff like I

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
as a

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
not just as like a curiosity

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
shop thing but as a transfusion

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
of self-esteem I'm like

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
I want to know

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
at which point are you going like

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
like where are you at the nadir

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
of like

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
I'm fucked

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
like they got me like they caught me

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
doing anything wrong but like

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
the bullies one

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
I'm going back home

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
I was honestly like I had so many

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
scenarios playing in my head

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
I was like oh shit what if they

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
like take my phone

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
and then I have like no one

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
I was like no one in port like no one knows where I am

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
right now because I'm like I haven't

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
like I haven't like it was like

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
like very early in the morning I haven't posted anything

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
no one will know where I was taken from

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
also the worst is that they'd be like

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
we saw him bombing in this cafeteria and then

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
he disappeared

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
exactly I was like what if they took your phone

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
and you went you went through a brief

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
but adventurous phase

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
at the subreddit gone wild audio

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
alright so

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
all I'm saying is once you take a mother fucker's phone

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
Dan let them finish this

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
you want to prove they're a bad person

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
you

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
let's forget dance

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
let's forget dance here let's finish this

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
story now because this is compelling

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
shit we're not getting through this because

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
so you like take us to the end

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
and then I resent that I think that I'm providing

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
a pretty good you don't have to stick up for me

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
it's fine I

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
shut up Dan be quiet

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
I appreciate that

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
so the

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
the end of the story and then you get

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
into a Twitter warfare that goes on

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
so like take us to the end of that

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
no sorry no

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000

he's on the sidewalk he's freezing

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
take us to the end of the story and then get

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
like this is only act two basically of what's going on

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
absolutely yeah this is like not even where the story is

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
like this is like nothing

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
but if Dan would be quiet for five seconds

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
like if you look at their faces they've never said

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
the word sorry before like they

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
I don't know how to describe that like have you ever seen

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
someone like seeing someone's face

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
I'm like you look racist

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
that's how they looked

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
like seriously

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
do I look racist no

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
in a brief interjection

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
like I told you

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
don't flinch

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
that makes me look racist

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
Mahan is like

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
like you could be an actor

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
and play like any ethnicity

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
almost so you could play

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
you could play anything absolutely

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
I look like

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
a Caucasian like

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
Germanic dude I had

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
in my passport

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
a bunch of things

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
I visited

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
Saudi Arabia and Yemen and Dubai

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
and

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
UAE

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
no Abu Dhabi

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
Abu Dhabi do

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
I've been to Abu Dhabi

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
but I had a customs officer

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
and I look like

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
a very white American dude

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
and

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
they see Arabic in my passport

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
and the customs when I came back

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
into like LAX

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
the guy's like what the fuck is this

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
I go

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
I was in Saudi Arabia he goes why

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
I go they're one of our allies

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
and I was performing for the troops

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
what's your fucking next question

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
they like funded 9-11

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
yeah

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
so

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
okay

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
if you want your next 9-11 funded

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
you need to let me into this country now

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
see that was my mistake for interjecting

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
alright so

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
so now take us to the streets

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
where you get fucking online

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
and fucking get in trouble

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
yeah I was on the bus

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
I got on the bus first I texted

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
my girlfriend I texted like friends

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
they were like oh my god you can't believe what happened

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
right now this and this happened

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
and then I was like

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
no one on the bus was talking to me

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
like no one said anything positive

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
or negative which felt like

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
cause they all saw you get taken off and put back on

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
exactly yeah what about the other people just curious

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
it was you and like three people

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
some well I came on the bus

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
another person came on the bus and the third

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
person they took away with them so I have no idea

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
so somebody lost the lottery

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
and everyone witnessed it

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
it's sitting in a greyhound bus

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
and everyone was just happy

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
that we're finally moving

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
I mean like we see this

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
the united guy gets stunned baton

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
or somebody like chokes a dog

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
if you're sitting in these seats

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
it's very

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
very normalized it felt like

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
oh yeah we see this everyday who cares

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
one person was taken

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
but also when is the revolution supposed to start

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
you're socialized

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
to go like

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
my job is to sit here

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
and then people can come

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
well yeah if you hear people on the internet

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
and the responses to my thread

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
everyone was going to be the hero that day

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
I fucking hate all of the internet

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
yeah same

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
you'll know why

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
so the dust has settled

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
the wheels are rolling you're on your way to portland

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
so yeah because like no one was talking to me

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
I was like I have this thing

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
I guess I have to

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
tell people on social media so I wrote this

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
whole thread on twitter

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
and just like describe exactly

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
what I've told everyone like what happened

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
I read this thread it's fucking crazy man

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
yeah it was just like

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
so I wrote the whole thing posted a picture of

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
the agents who stopped me and everything

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
just to prove that this

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
thing actually happened

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
because I took a picture of them like when I was like

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
when I got on the bus they were taking a person

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
so I took like snap a few pictures of that

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
and like posted that on a tweet as well

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
and then

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
not an hour from that

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
thread just blew up

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
it was just like going viral

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
like everyone was just like retweeting the whole thing

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
it was just like getting like

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
okay 10k, 20k, 30k, 100k

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
okay I don't know what

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
and then out of nowhere getting dms and emails

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
from like news agency like everyone like

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
had you ever had anything like that go that big

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
like on your twitter before

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
I had a dumb tweet about Uber

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
that got half a million likes

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
and people were like why are you using Uber

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
yeah it was a joke about Uber

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
which is so funny

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
which is so funny because

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
every viral tweet that I write

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
has to do with transportation

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
that's my friend

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
it was funny the uber treats great

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
but

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
is there a feeling there

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
or is it like

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
like

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
that blowing up

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
that virality

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
is

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
I don't want to lead the witness

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
but this feeling

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
of like you're even

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
people that are on your side

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
are pushing you

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
because you became symbolic

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
and you're alone though

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
you're being retweeted

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
because

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
people that want

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
your experience

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
but

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
I don't know what to ask you about that

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
I'm just like doesn't the fucking

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
world suck

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
the internet

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
one of my questions is

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
when you sat back on the bus

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
after having that experience

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
what was your feeling but then

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
as those retweets

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
and viral things started coming in

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
I guess I'm leading you to say

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
actually that was worse

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
because that's when people started

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
sticking up for me

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
and that's when shit got abusive

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
yes that's very true

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
when I got on the bus I'm not going to be like

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
I was like on the verge of tears

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
I was like

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
just so upset and so mad

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
because this thing just happened

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
because it felt really dehumanizing

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
because like

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
in my brain I'm like

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
I'm doing all of these things

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
and I'm doing comedy and people like me and stuff

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
and then you have this one brief moment

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
when you're like is reminded that you're an other

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
and I'm like oh man

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
gotta tweet this because it's inherently comedic

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
otherwise what's my job

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
were you in trouble online

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
like didn't you get death threats and stuff like that

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
yeah I did and I think one of the reasons

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
it was like a lot of big names

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
just like retweeting it and then

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
I think the point where it got really big

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
when Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
also retweeted it

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
and they wrote her thing

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
and I was like holy shit okay

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
did it panic you?

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
yeah I was like oh wow

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
okay this is some congress shit here

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
does that make you go like it's out of control

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
when it got to that point

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
I was like okay this is national right now

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
did you appreciate that

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
or did you wish

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
that didn't get that much traction

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
you might get in trouble

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
there are two parts of me

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
like one part was like as a person I was like

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
I don't need this

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
I wish that this didn't happen

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
this is inconvenient but also there was

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
the other part of me was like

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
I'm a person who is privileged enough to have a platform

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
I'm a person who is privileged enough to have

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
to speak English well and do all of these things

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
and this thing that happened to me

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
happens all the time

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
exactly and I'm like

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
if I don't speak I'm like

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
this is gonna be a story like it's gonna be thrown away

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
because a lot of people were like

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
surprised that this happens

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
they had no idea that it was happening before

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
the fact that

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
somebody I don't know

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
who put that into my eyeballs

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
someone said you have to read this thread

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
it might have been like Sarah Silverman

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
or whatever

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
someone said you have to read this thread

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
and I read the whole thing

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
and the thing that struck me

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
first and foremost is that

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
you have again an audience

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
a voice

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
and you get

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
a lot of eyeballs on your story

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
but this happens to people that don't have

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
any recourse or anything

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
and

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
the fact that you're from Libya

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
you're an asylum seeker

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
and you go through this arduous process

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
and yet you still

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
as an American

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
as far as

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
legally everything is concerned

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
you get to be

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
made to feel like the other

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
and that you get to feel like

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
you don't belong

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
what you absolutely fucking do

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
and then what about the people that

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
don't speak English and don't have any recourse

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
and don't have the $3,000

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
to get their shit together

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
absolutely

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
because I can't get over

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
that person who was taken away

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
because I'm like he was standing next to me

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
and I don't know if he had papers or not

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
it's the fact that he couldn't even speak

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
English that well so he was

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
being harassed

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
I don't think he even understood what they wanted

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
and it was like

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
holy shit this is like disgusting

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
and then when I wrote about it

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
people from Spokane was like this happens all the time

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
Greyhound is letting those people

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
both ICE and both CBB on the bus

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
all the time they're complicit

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
and they don't have to

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
because there has to be a warrant

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
for them to get on the bus

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
are there stories about some bus driver saying

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
no you gotta show me some fucking warrant

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
I think that happens sometimes too

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
there was two stories where I read

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
a bus driver show me the warrant

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
and then there was this other story

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
with this African American lady

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
who stood up she was a citizen

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
and when they came in

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
the bus they were like don't fucking give them your papers

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
it's your fourth amendment

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
right and all of this stuff and they got off the bus

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000
so emotionally where does that

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
put you right now in terms of like

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
how do you feel

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
as a citizen

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
or your desire to be a citizen here

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
where does that put you oh it does not change my desire

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
by any means because like this is what they want

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
they want me to leave they want me to go away

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
and I'm not fucking doing that

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
and once you're a citizen

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
you have

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
you have a vote and you have everything

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
I

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
like here's the

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
thing that I want to gain from you

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
and it's all about me

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
is like because I

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
I am

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
clearly so fragile so narcissistic

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
so fucking like

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
like entitled

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
I'm not used to this idea

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
of people

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
not wanting me around

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
and I

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
these times we're living in

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
we're all connected and I just like

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
I want to get a self-esteem transfusion

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
from you because I don't

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
like I'm just this

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
pudgy fucking like

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
I'm like

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
well if you don't like me then I'm going to go away

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
and all this stuff and I'm like

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000
what does it feel like so you get back

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
on the bus and then you're like

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
texting your girlfriend you're texting

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
people and you're like kind of pumped

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
I'm familiar with that chapter

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
of outrage and

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
like alienation

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
but what I've never been able to cope with

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
is that other chapter

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
where you tweet and you go

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
this just happened to me and people start saying

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
like fuck you

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
who the fuck are you

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
where the fucker is your name

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
in my fucking twitter timeline

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
I wish you would fucking

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
die

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
it's not as simple as asking you like

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
how do you cope with that because I've asked that

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
to a million people and they all go

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
just don't think about it

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
I'm not going to be lying

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
and be like oh that was easy to deal with

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
it's obviously something

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
it's definitely hurtful and

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
you kind of like I wish

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
that wasn't happening but

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
it doesn't make me personally

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
it doesn't make me feel sad that they were saying

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
this stuff about me it makes me

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
sad and there are some people who are

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
that vile and that horrible

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
I'm just like in some sense

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
I feel so bad for you

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
too that you

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
this is how you lead your life

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
I can't get there yeah

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000
this has always been the thing is that

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
racism is not

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
it seems like it's an incredible accomplishment

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
to those who wish to practice it

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
they are so impressed

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
I'm a third degree racist

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
they are so impressed

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
by their systemic racism

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
they think that this thing that they've built

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
is so awful

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
it sucks

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
but it is not very smart

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
it's not very efficient

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
it's not the best way to do anything

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
so the way that we who are oppressed

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
feel about it is like

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
it's a fucking mat

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
it goes by your ear it doesn't stop

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
your spirituality it certainly doesn't

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
stop you from rising up

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
it's just this inconvenience

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
racism is like

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
people taking the steps out of a set of

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
steps you know you're going to get

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
where you're going you just can't believe

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
a motherfucker would build like that

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
exactly

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
I can't believe these stairs

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
have to

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
go around this guy's guitar pool

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
we're friends with Paul Feig

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
Paul Feig has a new thing

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
with his

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
powder keg thing called break the room

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
you have a deal with him

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
let's talk about that

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
break the room initiative

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
we're writing a story that revolves

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
around my life

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
and my personal

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
color experience to being in

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
Portland

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
and it's kind of focusing

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
more of like

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
being a person of color like a refugee or an immigrant

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
in a place that is

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
hyper liberal

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
in a liberal bubble

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
that thinks is like the perfect utopia

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
and yet it's 90%

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
the show is going to be

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
kind of like an anti-Portlandia

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
kind of thing

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
this is what you don't see in Portlandia

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
look at all of these people

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
and like their experiences

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
and stuff because it's definitely

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
an experience that we mean

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
yes I do have my own struggle

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
and have my own stuff but also

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
a lot of people of color

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
who live in Portland they share the same experience

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
of just being

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
a place where it gets too liberal

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
that you're like silenced all the time

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
because you reminded

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
of like no this is great

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
like what do you mean this is not good

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
this is like the best way I can describe it

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
is like

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
that show the good place

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
where they think that they're in the good

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
place and everyone's like this is heaven

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
this is really great and then

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
at the ending like oh this is the bad place

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
this has been held this whole time

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
oh god spoilers

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
who cares

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
now

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
I guess they're giving seasons away

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
these days

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
you know in my day

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
you had to retain 90% of the

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
offices audience and you were fucking out

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
you were back to

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
continue

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
because Portland for all of its hyper-liberalism

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
is still like a very white

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
very kind of closet

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
it is a different type

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
of racism that you deal with

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
it's passive aggressive racism

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
that's what you deal with

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
you can feel like an outsider

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
in a very liberal community

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
and how does that daily play out

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
like what's the day to day

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000
things that happen to you

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
where you are reminded that you're the other

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
it is sometimes

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
like when you're like trying to go by

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
your day and then someone has

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
to bring up something that they saw on the news

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
because like I wake up every day

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
like I surprise don't think

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
about what happening in Libya every day

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
it's just like I try not to think about it

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
because I'm like I left that place so I'm like

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
I'm proud to be from there

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
that should make you automatically America

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
yeah exactly

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
I don't give a fuck about these bastards

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
I haven't thought about Libya in 3 years

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
I'm American

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000
and then you have those people

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
like

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
that come to you like oh my god

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
so I read this thing about Libya today

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
like this is must be so terrible

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
that's me

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
that's me

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
if I'm bartending where you drink

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
and I know you're from Libya

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
you're being Portland right now

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
but that's annoying

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
because it's like they're looking at you as an immigrant

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
exactly because there's like

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
two narratives for immigrants

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
I thought you were Italian when you came on stage

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
a lot of people think that

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
there's like two narratives when it comes to immigrants

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
you have the Republican side

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
where you're vilified every day

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000
you suck, leave

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
and then you have liberals

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
which is mostly like no matter what you do

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
sometimes you want you to be the victim so bad

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
it doesn't let you rise

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000
because you can't leave

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
because they want to make you feel like

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
you need that help all the time

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
and once you break through

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
I'm like I'm doing it

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
and they're like yeah but you're not a citizen

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
so good luck with that

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
if you're trying to run away from us

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
you don't need our help

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
we have to help you every step of the way

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
because you need us

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
it's just like this white savior kind of thing

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
and I'm like I don't need you

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
I can do this on my own

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
a word for us

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
we're socialized to feel that way

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
it's not easy

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
we're told that we're in charge of the world

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
we're in sixth grade

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
and then we're like turned out loose into this world

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
that we don't run

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
and they're like fuck you

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
and we're like okay

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
you're racist

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
it's very hard to be in charge

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
so sorry

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
I'm in charge of everything all the time

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
when I hate it

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
I created a Plymouth rock

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
that I couldn't lift

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
I want to help you Brandon

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
but you're not poor enough

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
yeah that is

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
I

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
that's one of the many things

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
that idea of

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
if you're a white American

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
and you encounter someone

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000
that you perceive

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
as

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
extrinsic

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
in any way

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
whether it's by accent, complexion or whatever

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
the most liberal component

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
of the white American

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
I'm speaking for myself has this impulse

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
I'm going to be an engine

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
of understanding and connection

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
and the way I'm going to express that is

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000
I'm going to ask you where are you from

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
and when you say Portland I'm going to go

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
no really where from

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
and that we're waking up into this world

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
where actually that's you

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
like fucking up and how would you like to

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
it's like a

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
I'm done talking

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
I'm going to ask you

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
go ahead Brandon

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
you take it

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
no

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
no you fucking take it baby

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
alright I'll make it quick

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
if I can do it

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000
how is the conduit

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
getting here from the United States

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
will you help other people do this

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
now that you're here it's interesting

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
because you seem like you were an ambassador

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
will you be an ambassador for other Libyans

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
trying to get to the United States

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
are there organizations like that

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
how can we help

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
I mean now

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
it's very very tricky

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
because obviously

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
I do my best to help

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
I'm not involved in any bigger organization

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
or something but I'm willing to

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000
there's so many organizations

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
important stuff that would reach out to me

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
to like what's the best way

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
to help and I'm always

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
can you shout them out

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000
there's one organization called Airco

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000
that does a lot of help

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
there's also Mercy Corps that

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
located in Portland they do a lot of work

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
with refugees and immigrants

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
those two organizations mostly do a lot of work

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
to help especially like once you're here

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
they kind of like

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000
there are places that can be funded

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000
because actually it occurs to me that we need to

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000
update our

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
Airco is definitely a place that can be updated

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
how do you spell it

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
it's I-R-C-O

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000
I-R-C-O

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
is anyone up there less drunk

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
and paying attention

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000
I don't know

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000
what's your favorite one

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000
I would go with that for sure

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000
because this helps people

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
and they also provide a lot of

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000
immigrants

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
people who

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
have been through trauma

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
and stuff like that

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
they get you a doctor and stuff

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
to help you through that

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
so they definitely do a lot of work

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
did you just love that you learned shrink

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000
did you just portland because

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
that was amenable to that

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
refugee process or

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
I didn't pick Portland for that

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
because the program I was on

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
they picked Portland State University

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
for the program so after the program

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
was done I was like well I'm in Portland now

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000
and at least I know a few people

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
and right now just like

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000
today Monday

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.000
are you still getting hate

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
are you still getting threatened

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
or did your status

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
in terms of your own comfort

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000
or go up or down

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
or where are you at right now

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
now it's kind of like in the middle honestly

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000
what do you do

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000
Dan let me answer the question

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000
it was answering a question

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000
no it is in the middle because

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000
it feels like some days it goes up

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000
and I'm like oh everything is great

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000
and then it's taken down

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
just to go back to your question about helping and stuff

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000
the reason that sometimes it's taken down

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
because we're doing well and then

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000
travel ban and Libya is on it

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
people can't come in the country

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000
my family can't come visit

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000
we're stuck in this situation

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.000
what do we do

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000
and then some days it goes up

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000
because some days some things happen

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000
and we're like oh someone cared

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000
someone did something like that

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000
you kind of like

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
have more hope

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
and then something like this

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
ICE and CBB things happen

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
and you're like oh fuck this

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000
this is I hate all of this

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
is there light at the end of that tunnel for you

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000
do you see a place

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
where you go okay I'm full on

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
so nobody can fuck with me anymore

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
or is that just going to always be a thing

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000
for you here it's always going to be a thing

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000
as a person of color

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000
you get a citizenship and what does that mean

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000
like in the eyes

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
of some Americans

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000
you're never going to be a true American

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
because you're just

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
different you have an accent

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000
you're a person of color you're black

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000
you're just like

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
you're never them

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
and you can have an HBO special

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000
and you can still be the other

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000
you can still be the other

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000
and to bring it back to where we at

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000
the whole beginning with this thing

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000
with that rapper 21 Savage

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
this is a person

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000
who has contributed so much

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000
to the community

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000
is super famous

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000
and then has the thing happened to them

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000
and last night at the Grammys

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000
they even mentioned them

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000
and it was a Swedish producer

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000
I'm like what about all of these people

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000
this guy is nominated

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000
and he's not there and not a single person

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000
would talk about like

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000
because they don't want to make it political

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000
while someone is just wearing build-a-wall

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000
thing on the red carpet

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000
they weren't really concerned with him

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000
until he started doing children's programs

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000
in Atlanta

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
so that's one of the reasons we're super pissed

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
it's not just

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
really a guy who came to the United States

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
made money in the United States

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
and then gave back in ways that citizens don't

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000
you see the government part of it

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
and then you see the citizens part of it

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
how does this person move

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
from there to

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000
having

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
nobody is just being like

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
he only stayed his visa

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
what do you know about immigration laws

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
also what have you contributed to this country

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
if we want to take it by contribution

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
most of the people will be gone

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000
you've done nothing

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000
we all need to be more easily triggered by that shit

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
I mean not to be corny but that old

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
poem about like first they came for so and so

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000
and then they came for a lot of a lot

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000
and it's like that's my narcissistic nightmare

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000
there is a path from narcissism

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000
to patriotism

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000
to

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000
actually defending

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
the fucking line where it's like

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
actually I don't want to be

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
the guy that is responsible

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
I don't want to be standing

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
on my front porch

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
having everything up to me

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
please make this easy on me

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000
please provide me with a country

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
that understands this shit so I don't have to deal with it

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
you can be lazy

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000
and stupid and selfish

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000
you can even be a little bit racist

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
my grandfather was

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
17 years old

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000
and you gotta

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000
there's absolutely no way that the reason he

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000
lied about his age to go off

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000
and bayonet people in World War II

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000
was because he

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000
hated

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000
racism

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000
he hated fascism

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000
he hated the idea

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000
that

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000
being my grandpa wouldn't be up to him one day

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000
he was selfish enough

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.000
narcissistic enough

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000
even misogynistic and sexist enough

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000
to take up a bayonet and go actually

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000
finally there's a bad guy I can identify with

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000
and like

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000
fuck god damn it Harmon

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
you're drunk and you've started

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
your shit

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
anyways how are you

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
you have Pisces

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000
I'm actually a Pisces

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000
have a nap

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000
one thing I wanted to ask you

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
which may put you on the spot

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000
after all of this

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
you're a person that has no experience

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
that is parallel to mine

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000
and I'm curious

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
because meanwhile

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000
I'm like

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000
there's absolutely no

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000
synchronicity between our like

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000
rhythms of like

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000
sometimes you're popping a locket

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
and I'm kind of like

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000
I'm almost twice your age

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000
and I'm wondering

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000
what is your feeling about

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000
the construct called America

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000
you can decline

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000
to answer that question

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000
I can answer it

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000
the concept on paper

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000
is great

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
this is the perfect nation

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
but then in practice

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000
most of the things that this country

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
preaches is not practice

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000
it's mostly practice in like other countries

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000
for some reason they're doing it well

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.000
they're taking those American ideals

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000
and the American dream

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000
and they're doing it across the world

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000
which is not necessarily a huge irony

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000
I heard this

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000
NPR special that I was like

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000
hammering on

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000
I don't even understand what

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
I guess I'll listen back

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000
and I'll find out why

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000
yeah you do

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000
I can't wait to

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000
I mean what is the problem

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.000
okay

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.000
go ahead

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.000
will you mark this and you'll listen to this point

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000
I mean I'm paying attention

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000
I want to mark this point so you're listening right now

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000
as a sober person and you're listening to the podcast

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000
correct

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000
because you're listening to it

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
and our guest who is interesting talk

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000
you keep interrupting him

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000
while he's giving interesting answers

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000
because you want to talk about your own narcissism

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000
and you're fucking blowing it

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000
you're making it a giant bummer

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
like this guy's fucking fascinating

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
and you don't let him get free words without wanting to talk about yourself again

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000
okay well

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000
okay go on

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
go on

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000
my opinion is that

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.000
that is technically accurate

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000
but an exaggeration

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000
thank you so much everybody

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000

I know I don't

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000
I don't really get it

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000
give it up for

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000
everything went great

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000
we could have heard more from our guest

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000
that's all right

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000
