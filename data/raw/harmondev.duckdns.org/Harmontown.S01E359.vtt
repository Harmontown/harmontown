entendre

00:16.000 --> 00:43.660
Hello gang, welcome to the penultimate Harmontown.

00:43.660 --> 00:48.660
We made it. Welcome to all of our travelers from all over the world and all over the country

00:48.660 --> 01:18.480
are coming. Harmontown is now in session. Rob Schrab. Spencer Crittenden.

01:18.480 --> 01:45.640
And the inevitable, Dan Harmon. Thank you all the time. Thank you all the way. Thank you all the

01:45.640 --> 02:04.460
time.

02:04.460 --> 02:06.460
What's your tell?

02:06.460 --> 02:08.460
Damn.

02:08.460 --> 02:10.460
Damn.

02:10.460 --> 02:12.460
Damn.

02:12.460 --> 02:14.460
Damn.

02:14.460 --> 02:16.460
Damn.

02:16.460 --> 02:18.460
I remember the time.

02:20.460 --> 02:22.460
Spencer.

02:22.460 --> 02:24.460
Spencer.

02:24.460 --> 02:26.460
Hey, Rob.

02:28.460 --> 02:32.460
I see you already did something lateral.

02:32.460 --> 02:34.460
No.

02:34.460 --> 02:36.460
Damn.

02:36.460 --> 02:38.460
That was me.

02:38.460 --> 02:40.460
I knock over a stool twice.

02:40.460 --> 02:42.460
Damn.

02:42.460 --> 02:44.460
I remember the time.

02:44.460 --> 02:46.460
When you do knock over a stool.

02:46.460 --> 02:48.460
Twice.

02:50.460 --> 02:52.460
Yeah, okay.

02:52.460 --> 02:54.460
Good.

02:54.460 --> 02:56.460
Hey, hey.

02:56.460 --> 03:02.460
The podcast is just starting.

03:02.460 --> 03:06.460
I remember the time when we started.

03:08.460 --> 03:10.460
You're doing great.

03:10.460 --> 03:12.460
All right, all right, come on.

03:12.460 --> 03:14.460
Knock it off. All right.

03:14.460 --> 03:16.460
Welcome to Harmontown, everybody.

03:16.460 --> 03:18.460
Jeff Davis, Rob Chubb, Spencer.

03:18.460 --> 03:20.460
I don't have...

03:22.460 --> 03:24.460
This is the second to last Harmontown.

03:24.460 --> 03:26.460
Yeah, I feel like I had a...

03:26.460 --> 03:28.460
I must have had a dream that I wrote something.

03:28.460 --> 03:30.460
Did you ever...

03:30.460 --> 03:32.460
I'll be right back.

03:32.460 --> 03:34.460
Did you ever have a podcast and this happened to you?

03:34.460 --> 03:36.460
That guy's gonna take a shit.

03:36.460 --> 03:40.460
That guy is going to take a shit.

03:40.460 --> 03:42.460
That body language is only...

03:42.460 --> 03:44.460
I have to take a giant.

03:44.460 --> 03:46.460
With somebody who goes, oh no, I'll be right back.

03:46.460 --> 03:48.460
Runs that way.

03:48.460 --> 03:50.460
Going to take a shit.

03:50.460 --> 03:52.460
Yeah, that's the Del Taco Trots right there.

03:52.460 --> 03:54.460
Yeah.

03:54.460 --> 03:56.460
Yeah.

03:56.460 --> 03:58.460
I want to know all about it when he gets back.

03:58.460 --> 04:00.460
Oh, shit.

04:00.460 --> 04:02.460
Oh, boom.

04:02.460 --> 04:04.460
We don't have Steve Levy tonight.

04:04.460 --> 04:06.460
So he's on vodka patrol.

04:06.460 --> 04:08.460
He didn't have to take a shit.

04:08.460 --> 04:10.460
That would have never came out otherwise.

04:10.460 --> 04:12.460
What?

04:12.460 --> 04:14.460
No one would...

04:14.460 --> 04:16.460
I have to fetch vodka every time I take a shit.

04:16.460 --> 04:18.460
Oh.

04:18.460 --> 04:20.460
Yeah, I don't have any notes.

04:20.460 --> 04:22.460
I think it just...

04:22.460 --> 04:24.460
We're in the last leg of the podcast.

04:24.460 --> 04:26.460
I think it's important to note.

04:26.460 --> 04:28.460
I must have had a dream that I

04:28.460 --> 04:30.460
wrote down a note classic.

04:30.460 --> 04:32.460
Because I remember today I was like,

04:32.460 --> 04:34.460
well, I got that one note that I wrote.

04:34.460 --> 04:36.460
And that was like, in the dream,

04:36.460 --> 04:38.460
I was like, I got to talk about this in the podcast.

04:38.460 --> 04:40.460
In my dream, I thumbed a note

04:40.460 --> 04:42.460
into my notes app.

04:42.460 --> 04:44.460
And I was like, go talk about that.

04:44.460 --> 04:46.460
And it was in a dream.

04:46.460 --> 04:48.460
The reality is,

04:48.460 --> 04:50.460
this show is not worth

04:50.460 --> 04:52.460
coming to.

04:52.460 --> 04:54.460
That's the reality.

04:54.460 --> 04:56.460
But in my dreams, it was.

04:56.460 --> 04:58.460
I dream about it.

04:58.460 --> 05:00.460
It's affecting me.

05:00.460 --> 05:02.460
I wrote a note that I was eating a giant marshmallow.

05:02.460 --> 05:04.460
All right, well, that's Jeff.

05:06.460 --> 05:08.460
I always have dreams where it's like,

05:08.460 --> 05:10.460
the dream is just me standing in my room

05:10.460 --> 05:12.460
and I pull out my wallet and I place $5

05:12.460 --> 05:14.460
into my wallet and I put it back in my pocket.

05:14.460 --> 05:16.460
And then I'm like, that wasn't a dream.

05:16.460 --> 05:18.460
It was $5 and nope.

05:18.460 --> 05:20.460
That's like, that was the podcast equivalent.

05:20.460 --> 05:22.460
That's what you did.

05:22.460 --> 05:24.460
What are the ratio of dreams you have

05:24.460 --> 05:26.460
that are like,

05:26.460 --> 05:28.460
because we have dreams where

05:28.460 --> 05:30.460
you wake up from the dream

05:30.460 --> 05:32.460
and for a second you're like, that's real.

05:32.460 --> 05:34.460
And then you're like, oh, that's not real.

05:34.460 --> 05:36.460
What do you think the ratio is

05:36.460 --> 05:38.460
when that's good and what's bad?

05:38.460 --> 05:40.460
5%!

05:40.460 --> 05:42.460
Oh.

05:42.460 --> 05:44.460
Because sometimes it's good, sometimes it's bad, right?

05:44.460 --> 05:46.460
$50 when you wake up and you're like,

05:46.460 --> 05:48.460
I didn't find no $50.

05:48.460 --> 05:50.460
I'd say it's almost always bad.

05:50.460 --> 05:52.460
I feel like

05:52.460 --> 05:54.460
in the last couple of years

05:54.460 --> 05:56.460
every time that's happened to me

05:56.460 --> 05:58.460
it's been exclusively good.

05:58.460 --> 06:00.460
Like, and maybe that's a privilege thing

06:00.460 --> 06:02.460
because I've excelled

06:02.460 --> 06:04.460
to a point where I'm like,

06:04.460 --> 06:06.460
my dreams are now just about

06:06.460 --> 06:08.460
like, my car's got

06:08.460 --> 06:10.460
a flat tire and then I wake up and I'm like,

06:10.460 --> 06:12.460
no it doesn't.

06:12.460 --> 06:14.460
My car was throwing up metal spaghetti.

06:14.460 --> 06:16.460
I had another dream

06:16.460 --> 06:18.460
where all my teeth were falling out,

06:18.460 --> 06:20.460
one tooth fell out, then the other tooth fell out.

06:20.460 --> 06:22.460
That means you're getting sick.

06:22.460 --> 06:24.460
Yeah, I know, and I was.

06:24.460 --> 06:26.460
And the whole bottom row of my teeth

06:26.460 --> 06:28.460
just cracked off in one piece,

06:28.460 --> 06:30.460
like a Dracula dentures.

06:30.460 --> 06:32.460
And then I was like, this is the worst thing

06:32.460 --> 06:34.460
that's ever happened to me.

06:34.460 --> 06:36.460
And then I was like telling people about it

06:36.460 --> 06:38.460
and I was like, wait a second, I could talk perfectly.

06:38.460 --> 06:40.460
This is a dream!

06:40.460 --> 06:42.460
But how many dreams have you,

06:42.460 --> 06:44.460
can you remember a dream where you,

06:44.460 --> 06:46.460
it was a great thing that was happening

06:46.460 --> 06:48.460
and then you woke up and you're like,

06:48.460 --> 06:50.460
I can't wait to get out of bed

06:50.460 --> 06:52.460
because that thing happened, no it didn't.

06:52.460 --> 06:54.460
Yeah, one time I dreamed that I bought Pokemon Blue.

06:54.460 --> 06:56.460
Pokemon Blue.

06:56.460 --> 06:58.460
I had a dream that Kyle McLaughlin

06:58.460 --> 07:00.460
was a good friend of mine.

07:00.460 --> 07:02.460
And like,

07:02.460 --> 07:04.460
and I was like,

07:04.460 --> 07:06.460
because I met him at like this party

07:06.460 --> 07:08.460
and I was like, oh man I can't wait

07:08.460 --> 07:10.460
really getting along.

07:10.460 --> 07:12.460
He's like listening to me and laughing at all my jokes

07:12.460 --> 07:14.460
and I'm like, I can't wait to go home

07:14.460 --> 07:16.460
and tell Kate, hey, yeah.

07:16.460 --> 07:18.460
Someone listen to me.

07:18.460 --> 07:20.460
Yeah, it was a dream.

07:22.460 --> 07:24.460
And then I woke up and then I was like,

07:24.460 --> 07:26.460
I don't know no Kyle McLaughlin.

07:28.460 --> 07:30.460
I got all bummed out.

07:30.460 --> 07:32.460
When I was a little kid,

07:32.460 --> 07:34.460
I had a dream that I could fly

07:34.460 --> 07:36.460
and I was running around in my

07:36.460 --> 07:38.460
driveway and it was like

07:38.460 --> 07:40.460
we had a basketball hoop

07:40.460 --> 07:42.460
and I had a dream that if I

07:42.460 --> 07:44.460
just wanted to, I could fly.

07:44.460 --> 07:46.460
Like in like, not like

07:46.460 --> 07:48.460
Superman like waiting in the sky, but I could just kind of

07:48.460 --> 07:50.460
hover around and just fly

07:50.460 --> 07:52.460
like 20 feet off the ground.

07:52.460 --> 07:54.460
It was an awesome, liberating dream.

07:54.460 --> 07:56.460
And I woke up, went out into the driveway

07:56.460 --> 07:58.460
and jumped in the air and believed

07:58.460 --> 08:00.460
I could fly and I guess what

08:00.460 --> 08:02.460
couldn't fly.

08:02.460 --> 08:04.460
Damn.

08:04.460 --> 08:06.460
That's what I had to flap my arms really hard.

08:08.460 --> 08:10.460
Did you ever dream that you could do that

08:10.460 --> 08:12.460
and then your arm extended?

08:12.460 --> 08:14.460
Like plastic man?

08:14.460 --> 08:16.460
No, like Space Jam.

08:18.460 --> 08:20.460
Because I mean it obviously brought me

08:20.460 --> 08:22.460
to R. Kelly when you said that.

08:22.460 --> 08:24.460
I believe I can fly. You literally believed

08:24.460 --> 08:26.460
you could fly.

08:26.460 --> 08:28.460
I dreamt I could fly and I was young

08:28.460 --> 08:30.460
and naive enough to think that all you have to do

08:30.460 --> 08:32.460
is will yourself to fly.

08:32.460 --> 08:34.460
It's amazing that you were young enough

08:34.460 --> 08:36.460
that you retained that dream belief

08:36.460 --> 08:38.460
enough that you got out of bed

08:38.460 --> 08:40.460
and ran out there.

08:40.460 --> 08:42.460
The moment I woke up, I went right out to where

08:42.460 --> 08:44.460
the dream took place in the driveway

08:44.460 --> 08:46.460
and I just, I thought like

08:46.460 --> 08:48.460
just jump and believe in yourself.

08:48.460 --> 08:50.460
Like believe you can do it.

08:50.460 --> 08:52.460
And I jumped up and went smack

08:52.460 --> 08:54.460
on the gravel.

08:54.460 --> 08:56.460
And I thought okay, that was a dream.

08:56.460 --> 08:58.460
This is a harsh awakening

08:58.460 --> 09:00.460
about the sadness of humanity.

09:00.460 --> 09:02.460
The sorrow.

09:02.460 --> 09:04.460
I think the nice thing about our species,

09:04.460 --> 09:06.460
I think the key to our victory

09:06.460 --> 09:08.460
and inevitably to our demise

09:08.460 --> 09:10.460
obviously we're all dying

09:10.460 --> 09:12.460
because of our success.

09:12.460 --> 09:14.460
It's a double-edged sword.

09:14.460 --> 09:16.460
It's like humanity.

09:16.460 --> 09:18.460
You did it. You're the most

09:18.460 --> 09:20.460
populist mammal on the planet.

09:20.460 --> 09:22.460
Therefore, game over, you're dead.

09:22.460 --> 09:24.460
Or you're going to become matrix people

09:24.460 --> 09:26.460
in either case win-win for insects.

09:26.460 --> 09:28.460
I think Jellyfish and Lobster

09:28.460 --> 09:30.460
are a little...

09:30.460 --> 09:32.460
But I think the romantic thing

09:32.460 --> 09:34.460
about our species is, as pointed out

09:34.460 --> 09:36.460
in Yanov Shmirov, whatever that guy's name is,

09:36.460 --> 09:38.460
Yako.

09:38.460 --> 09:40.460
No, no.

09:40.460 --> 09:42.460
Whatever the Yanov Shmirov

09:42.460 --> 09:44.460
of the guy.

09:44.460 --> 09:46.460
The guy I'm always quoting,

09:46.460 --> 09:48.460
his anthropology book that I,

09:48.460 --> 09:50.460
the Homo Deus guy.

09:50.460 --> 09:52.460
It's like our dreams,

09:52.460 --> 09:54.460
Homo sapiens, our dreams

09:54.460 --> 09:56.460
are louder than reality.

09:56.460 --> 09:58.460
I'm just majoring journalism.

09:58.460 --> 10:00.460
That's a fucking... Yeah, I've never looked it up.

10:00.460 --> 10:02.460
I'm going to be a journalism major.

10:02.460 --> 10:04.460
I believe in journalism.

10:04.460 --> 10:06.460
And then you can go to college for a semester

10:06.460 --> 10:08.460
and be like, journalism isn't real.

10:08.460 --> 10:10.460
And then you drop out.

10:10.460 --> 10:12.460
You're like, what am I going to do?

10:12.460 --> 10:14.460
And then people would be like, why would you do that?

10:14.460 --> 10:16.460
Why wouldn't you look up journalism?

10:16.460 --> 10:18.460
Not because I thought...

10:18.460 --> 10:20.460
I believed in it.

10:20.460 --> 10:22.460
I wonder how many journalists

10:22.460 --> 10:24.460
lobsters there are.

10:24.460 --> 10:26.460
You hear about the Cybertruck.

10:26.460 --> 10:28.460
Do you have any thoughts on Cybertruck?

10:28.460 --> 10:30.460
What's your temperature

10:30.460 --> 10:32.460
on Cybertruck?

10:32.460 --> 10:34.460
I love it.

10:34.460 --> 10:36.460
You guys are going to talk shit about my best friend Elon Musk.

10:36.460 --> 10:38.460
No, I'm just wondering.

10:38.460 --> 10:40.460
I love the Cybertruck.

10:40.460 --> 10:42.460
The only thing I don't love about the Cybertruck...

10:42.460 --> 10:44.460
Cybertruck.

10:44.460 --> 10:46.460
Coming to your town.

10:46.460 --> 10:48.460
Cybertruck.

10:48.460 --> 10:50.460
Driving you around.

10:50.460 --> 10:52.460
It's got street lines

10:52.460 --> 10:54.460
Sure, it's a Cybertruck

10:54.460 --> 10:56.460
Get some deal maker

10:56.460 --> 10:58.460
for sure.

10:58.460 --> 11:00.460
I got one problem with the Cybertruck.

11:00.460 --> 11:02.460
One!

11:02.460 --> 11:04.460
It's for poor people.

11:04.460 --> 11:06.460
It's clearly like the clean lines

11:06.460 --> 11:08.460
and all that.

11:08.460 --> 11:10.460
Oh, it's not for poor people.

11:10.460 --> 11:12.460
It's meant to protect rich people from the apocalypse.

11:12.460 --> 11:14.460
But not from throwing

11:14.460 --> 11:16.460
a brick at the window.

11:16.460 --> 11:18.460
No, it's meant to...

11:18.460 --> 11:20.460
No, it's got a really sensible price point.

11:20.460 --> 11:22.460
For when the world ends

11:22.460 --> 11:24.460
and you have to go between your billionaire compound

11:24.460 --> 11:26.460
so you can just drive over people

11:26.460 --> 11:28.460
with spears or whatever.

11:28.460 --> 11:30.460
Aesthetically, that's what it presents.

11:30.460 --> 11:32.460
But in reality,

11:32.460 --> 11:34.460
he's eliminated

11:34.460 --> 11:36.460
the big...

11:36.460 --> 11:38.460
because he caught so much shit

11:38.460 --> 11:40.460
for I'm going to make my own car.

11:40.460 --> 11:42.460
Part of why it's hard to make a car

11:42.460 --> 11:44.460
is because engineers will tell you

11:44.460 --> 11:46.460
you make humans feel safer

11:46.460 --> 11:48.460
by adding these weird Roman arches

11:48.460 --> 11:50.460
to the architecture

11:50.460 --> 11:52.460
which don't add to the safety of the car.

11:52.460 --> 11:54.460
But if you just make those straight lines

11:54.460 --> 11:56.460
he can make those cars even faster.

11:56.460 --> 11:58.460
They're cheaper. That truck's going to be cheap.

11:58.460 --> 12:00.460
That's what I read.

12:00.460 --> 12:02.460
It's not super expensive yet.

12:02.460 --> 12:04.460
Speaking of Wired Magazine,

12:04.460 --> 12:06.460
let's bring out our guests.

12:06.460 --> 12:08.460
I brought these guys down from San Francisco

12:08.460 --> 12:10.460
because we're in the final leg of our podcast.

12:10.460 --> 12:12.460
There's no rhyme or reason to it

12:12.460 --> 12:14.460
except that I love them.

12:14.460 --> 12:16.460
And the history of the show,

12:16.460 --> 12:18.460
using decade that we've spent together,

12:18.460 --> 12:20.460
one of the highlights was my ability

12:20.460 --> 12:22.460
to reach across the world

12:22.460 --> 12:24.460
having read a book and say,

12:24.460 --> 12:26.460
hey, come down to make a new friend.

12:26.460 --> 12:28.460
And I just wanted these guys

12:28.460 --> 12:30.460
to be here for the

12:30.460 --> 12:32.460
for the end times

12:32.460 --> 12:34.460
and chat with us.

12:34.460 --> 12:36.460
Is that a good introduction, Dan?

12:36.460 --> 12:38.460
I don't know.

12:38.460 --> 12:40.460
Let's bring out...

12:40.460 --> 12:42.460
Please welcome New York Times bestselling author...

12:42.460 --> 12:44.460
Cybertruck.

12:44.460 --> 12:46.460
Steve Silverman and Keith Carrack.

12:46.460 --> 12:48.460
Yeah!

12:58.460 --> 13:00.460
I had a dream that I was on the second

13:00.460 --> 13:02.460
to last Harmontown.

13:02.460 --> 13:04.460
That was so heavy.

13:04.460 --> 13:06.460
That dream is now a reality.

13:06.460 --> 13:08.460
Thank you for running NeuroTribes,

13:08.460 --> 13:10.460
which everyone should go read.

13:10.460 --> 13:12.460
We were talking in the green room

13:12.460 --> 13:14.460
about diagnosis.

13:14.460 --> 13:16.460
Self-diagnosis, diagnosis of others.

13:16.460 --> 13:18.460
We were getting into me.

13:18.460 --> 13:20.460
You were like,

13:20.460 --> 13:22.460
has your mind changed about anything?

13:22.460 --> 13:24.460
I had to clarify

13:24.460 --> 13:26.460
just so everyone knows.

13:26.460 --> 13:28.460
I never diagnosed myself with autism.

13:28.460 --> 13:30.460
Right.

13:30.460 --> 13:32.460
And what I was talking about

13:32.460 --> 13:34.460
was with some autistic people online

13:34.460 --> 13:36.460
and they were claiming

13:36.460 --> 13:38.460
that you had diagnosed yourself with autism.

13:38.460 --> 13:40.460
And I said, well, I don't know about that.

13:40.460 --> 13:42.460
I don't think so, but whatever Dan is,

13:42.460 --> 13:44.460
he's certainly neurodivergent.

13:44.460 --> 13:46.460
He's fucking weird, right?

13:46.460 --> 13:48.460
He's a weird guy.

13:48.460 --> 13:50.460
He's fucking weird.

13:50.460 --> 13:52.460
That was the important thing about your book.

13:52.460 --> 13:54.460
He's a fucking weird guy.

13:54.460 --> 13:56.460
Yeah, but the whole...

13:56.460 --> 13:58.460
Strange, right?

13:58.460 --> 14:00.460
Yeah, but the whole thing is that it's a fucking weird people

14:00.460 --> 14:02.460
that keeps society moving forward

14:02.460 --> 14:04.460
and not getting stuck in boring shit constantly.

14:04.460 --> 14:06.460
Okay, fine.

14:06.460 --> 14:08.460
You're weird too.

14:08.460 --> 14:10.460
Steve,

14:10.460 --> 14:12.460
you probably...

14:12.460 --> 14:14.460
You don't think you're qualified or anybody's really qualified

14:14.460 --> 14:16.460
to diagnose other people.

14:16.460 --> 14:18.460
But looking back through history,

14:18.460 --> 14:20.460
we could probably diagnose certain people

14:20.460 --> 14:22.460
probably with certain qualities.

14:22.460 --> 14:24.460
Well, the people who were retro-diagnosed,

14:24.460 --> 14:26.460
as they say in my book,

14:26.460 --> 14:28.460
they were diagnosed by people

14:28.460 --> 14:30.460
with actual qualifications to do so.

14:30.460 --> 14:32.460
So I would never...

14:32.460 --> 14:34.460
But looking at Dan,

14:34.460 --> 14:36.460
just look at him.

14:36.460 --> 14:38.460
Just to pick somebody at random.

14:38.460 --> 14:40.460
Yeah.

14:40.460 --> 14:42.460
What is wrong with him?

14:42.460 --> 14:44.460
Can you help us?

14:44.460 --> 14:46.460
Well, we were talking about

14:46.460 --> 14:48.460
ADD before,

14:48.460 --> 14:50.460
which seems right to me,

14:50.460 --> 14:52.460
but I'm certainly not qualified to diagnose anybody,

14:52.460 --> 14:54.460
but one gets a feeling.

14:54.460 --> 14:56.460
I resonated a lot

14:56.460 --> 14:58.460
with the ADHD books that I've read

14:58.460 --> 15:00.460
slash listened to because who wants to

15:00.460 --> 15:02.460
fucking read these pieces of shit?

15:02.460 --> 15:04.460
I got better things to do, god damn it.

15:04.460 --> 15:06.460
But the beauty is,

15:06.460 --> 15:08.460
if you have ADHD

15:08.460 --> 15:10.460
or whatever the fuck you have

15:10.460 --> 15:12.460
or don't have,

15:12.460 --> 15:14.460
what are the odds that science has come up

15:14.460 --> 15:16.460
with ways to compartmentalize all of us?

15:16.460 --> 15:18.460
The important thing about your book

15:18.460 --> 15:20.460
is that key phrase, neurodiversity.

15:20.460 --> 15:22.460
It is the idea of like,

15:22.460 --> 15:24.460
hey, it takes a million kinds of brain

15:24.460 --> 15:26.460
to make a great society.

15:26.460 --> 15:28.460
And that America,

15:28.460 --> 15:30.460
not to get jingoistic,

15:30.460 --> 15:32.460
but it's like because it's probably

15:32.460 --> 15:34.460
through our,

15:34.460 --> 15:36.460
we just didn't know how to stomp it out.

15:36.460 --> 15:38.460
But like,

15:38.460 --> 15:40.460
we created a country

15:40.460 --> 15:42.460
where if you can build it

15:42.460 --> 15:44.460
and it's worth money,

15:44.460 --> 15:46.460
you now go from being

15:46.460 --> 15:48.460
maybe the village idiot or the village geek

15:48.460 --> 15:50.460
or the village pervert to being

15:50.460 --> 15:52.460
like the village count,

15:52.460 --> 15:54.460
the village, you know,

15:54.460 --> 15:56.460
and if you read NeuroTribes,

15:56.460 --> 15:58.460
there's a part of it that is like,

15:58.460 --> 16:00.460
the history of America

16:00.460 --> 16:02.460
as it's

16:02.460 --> 16:04.460
undiagnosable relationship with autism

16:04.460 --> 16:06.460
and how always the people

16:06.460 --> 16:08.460
on the fringe have been creating

16:08.460 --> 16:10.460
new ways for us normies

16:10.460 --> 16:12.460
to communicate with each other.

16:12.460 --> 16:14.460
And us normies have messed up the world

16:14.460 --> 16:16.460
so badly that it might take somebody

16:16.460 --> 16:18.460
like Greta Thunberg,

16:18.460 --> 16:20.460
whose autism gives her the ability

16:20.460 --> 16:22.460
to not give a fuck

16:22.460 --> 16:24.460
about the lying

16:24.460 --> 16:26.460
whoever.

16:26.460 --> 16:28.460
That's the cycle,

16:28.460 --> 16:30.460
is someone who's like geeky

16:30.460 --> 16:32.460
and like draws fire,

16:32.460 --> 16:34.460
stepping out front and going like,

16:34.460 --> 16:36.460
look, I don't know

16:36.460 --> 16:38.460
how you people are

16:38.460 --> 16:40.460
approaching this, but in my mind

16:40.460 --> 16:42.460
here's how I approach it, and then

16:42.460 --> 16:44.460
yeah, we put them out there,

16:44.460 --> 16:46.460
we burn them at the stake, and then over the

16:46.460 --> 16:48.460
charcoal we roast our marshmallows,

16:48.460 --> 16:50.460
and then we start partying.

16:50.460 --> 16:52.460
Anyways, Keith, thank you

16:52.460 --> 16:54.460
for coming out too.

16:54.460 --> 16:56.460
Thanks for having me.

16:56.460 --> 16:58.460
I've literally since the invite have been

16:58.460 --> 17:00.460
just contemplating the entire audience going,

17:00.460 --> 17:02.460
huh?

17:02.460 --> 17:04.460
Who is that guy?

17:04.460 --> 17:06.460
Keith is Steve's husband as of 2003

17:06.460 --> 17:08.460
and like...

17:10.460 --> 17:12.460
That's our newer divergence.

17:12.460 --> 17:14.460
Yes, exactly.

17:14.460 --> 17:16.460
You own 60, 80, how many bow ties

17:16.460 --> 17:18.460
is Keith? 60-ish.

17:18.460 --> 17:20.460
He's one of the few people

17:20.460 --> 17:22.460
that actually knows how to tie a bow tie

17:22.460 --> 17:24.460
and I find that awesome.

17:24.460 --> 17:26.460
He's also a chemistry teacher,

17:26.460 --> 17:28.460
so it's sort of...

17:28.460 --> 17:30.460
A middle school chemistry teacher.

17:30.460 --> 17:32.460
No, I've moved up to high school.

17:32.460 --> 17:34.460
Oh, really? Yeah, I did middle school for 10 years,

17:34.460 --> 17:36.460
but...

17:36.460 --> 17:38.460
Is that how it works, our high school

17:38.460 --> 17:40.460
chemistry teachers? You're like,

17:40.460 --> 17:42.460
I finally know more about chemistry now.

17:42.460 --> 17:44.460
I've watched middle schoolers deal with

17:44.460 --> 17:46.460
oh, that's what potassium is.

17:46.460 --> 17:48.460
No, it's more the

17:48.460 --> 17:50.460
crowd control.

17:50.460 --> 17:52.460
The middle school crowd control was

17:52.460 --> 17:54.460
high school, you can handle it.

17:54.460 --> 17:56.460
And so they're like, yeah,

17:56.460 --> 17:58.460
that's a profound statement.

17:58.460 --> 18:00.460
I assume public school?

18:00.460 --> 18:02.460
No.

18:02.460 --> 18:04.460
No.

18:04.460 --> 18:06.460
But it really is based on that idea

18:06.460 --> 18:08.460
that kids are animals.

18:08.460 --> 18:10.460
And as they grow

18:10.460 --> 18:12.460
into adolescence, they increasingly

18:12.460 --> 18:14.460
become capable of putting your head through

18:14.460 --> 18:16.460
a chalkboard.

18:16.460 --> 18:18.460
Indeed. Well, thanks for that

18:18.460 --> 18:20.460
thought.

18:20.460 --> 18:22.460
Do they still have chalkboards?

18:22.460 --> 18:24.460
Yeah. Oh, absolutely.

18:24.460 --> 18:26.460
Yeah.

18:26.460 --> 18:28.460
But do you have a preference

18:28.460 --> 18:30.460
on chalkboard versus dry erase?

18:30.460 --> 18:32.460
Wiper chalk. Wiper chalk.

18:32.460 --> 18:34.460
Wiper chalk.

18:34.460 --> 18:36.460
So I had...

18:36.460 --> 18:38.460
Wiper chalk. I use chalkboards mostly.

18:38.460 --> 18:40.460
I've recently had to start

18:40.460 --> 18:42.460
using whiteboard. I hate it.

18:42.460 --> 18:44.460
Right. Definitely

18:44.460 --> 18:46.460
prefer chalkboard. It freaks me out too.

18:46.460 --> 18:48.460
Does the smell get you high? No, it's just

18:48.460 --> 18:50.460
those markers last about a week.

18:50.460 --> 18:52.460
Yeah.

18:52.460 --> 18:54.460
Chalk is durable.

18:54.460 --> 18:56.460
You can see from a stick of chalk

18:56.460 --> 18:58.460
how much chalk is left.

18:58.460 --> 19:00.460
Exactly.

19:00.460 --> 19:02.460
And you could go to war with China

19:02.460 --> 19:04.460
and lose. And if there's

19:04.460 --> 19:06.460
a little chalk left, you could be like,

19:06.460 --> 19:08.460
I know that's going to make a lot.

19:08.460 --> 19:10.460
And you could come into Rick and Morty

19:10.460 --> 19:12.460
a week later and be like, anyways,

19:12.460 --> 19:14.460
this story is really important. God fucking

19:14.460 --> 19:16.460
cock it!

19:16.460 --> 19:18.460
You can do that

19:18.460 --> 19:20.460
without going to war

19:20.460 --> 19:22.460
with China too.

19:22.460 --> 19:24.460
Yeah.

19:24.460 --> 19:26.460
What's your fucking beef

19:26.460 --> 19:28.460
with China then?

19:28.460 --> 19:30.460
Yeah. You could go to war with China

19:30.460 --> 19:32.460
and then go...

19:32.460 --> 19:34.460
All right, man.

19:34.460 --> 19:36.460
This is part of the reason I'm ending the podcast

19:36.460 --> 19:38.460
because there's going to come a time

19:38.460 --> 19:40.460
when you're either pro-China

19:40.460 --> 19:42.460
or anti-China and I'm not

19:42.460 --> 19:44.460
in it for that, man.

19:44.460 --> 19:46.460
Look. Free Hong Kong!

19:46.460 --> 19:48.460
So, Keith...

19:48.460 --> 19:50.460
Yeah.

19:50.460 --> 19:52.460
Keith, you're saying you're a guy

19:52.460 --> 19:54.460
in the world, old school

19:54.460 --> 19:56.460
slate and chalk dude. Yeah, I like that.

19:56.460 --> 19:58.460
Absolutely.

19:58.460 --> 20:00.460
But he still gets to blush it up, which is the fun part.

20:00.460 --> 20:02.460
You get to...

20:02.460 --> 20:04.460
Well, yeah,

20:04.460 --> 20:06.460
just, you know, make stuff change.

20:06.460 --> 20:08.460
Do you have any observations?

20:08.460 --> 20:10.460
How long have you been teaching?

20:10.460 --> 20:12.460
20 years now.

20:12.460 --> 20:14.460
You've got... You're in a prime position

20:14.460 --> 20:16.460
to make any observations.

20:16.460 --> 20:18.460
I know teachers always, like,

20:18.460 --> 20:20.460
give us any generational

20:20.460 --> 20:22.460
observations.

20:22.460 --> 20:24.460
Well, so one thing...

20:24.460 --> 20:26.460
Wow.

20:26.460 --> 20:28.460
I know.

20:28.460 --> 20:30.460
I'm really not that deep.

20:30.460 --> 20:32.460
One thing I will tell you that a lot of people don't know

20:32.460 --> 20:34.460
unless you work in a school is that

20:34.460 --> 20:36.460
teachers

20:36.460 --> 20:38.460
emotionally devolve to the level

20:38.460 --> 20:40.460
of the students that they teach.

20:40.460 --> 20:42.460
So, like,

20:42.460 --> 20:44.460
elementary school teachers,

20:44.460 --> 20:46.460
how they get upset

20:46.460 --> 20:48.460
is different from middle school teachers.

20:48.460 --> 20:50.460
Even including in the teacher's lounge, when they're like,

20:50.460 --> 20:52.460
who took my nilla wafers?

20:52.460 --> 20:54.460
Yeah, exactly.

20:54.460 --> 20:56.460
So, basically, I just am

20:56.460 --> 20:58.460
perpetually 15 now.

20:58.460 --> 21:00.460
And just swollen

21:00.460 --> 21:02.460
and withdrawn. Where's he used to be perpetually

21:02.460 --> 21:04.460
12? Yeah, exactly.

21:04.460 --> 21:06.460
So, I'm moving up in the world.

21:06.460 --> 21:08.460
Keith, are you being honest?

21:08.460 --> 21:10.460
Are you actually just a thing that you do

21:10.460 --> 21:12.460
to adapt and to be able to deal

21:12.460 --> 21:14.460
with them? Yeah, you just spend your whole

21:14.460 --> 21:16.460
day with people of the same age.

21:16.460 --> 21:18.460
I couldn't imagine hanging out

21:18.460 --> 21:20.460
with a bunch of 15-year-old

21:20.460 --> 21:22.460
me's. Like, I was just

21:22.460 --> 21:24.460
a prick.

21:24.460 --> 21:26.460
I haven't changed all that much, but

21:26.460 --> 21:28.460
I was just... So, yeah, on the record,

21:28.460 --> 21:30.460
my students are great.

21:30.460 --> 21:32.460
And if any of them are listening to this,

21:32.460 --> 21:34.460
don't.

21:34.460 --> 21:36.460
You gotta hate one of them.

21:36.460 --> 21:38.460
No, not at all.

21:38.460 --> 21:40.460
He can't talk about that.

21:40.460 --> 21:42.460
I don't have a favorite

21:42.460 --> 21:44.460
class section.

21:44.460 --> 21:46.460
No.

21:46.460 --> 21:48.460
They're all my favorites.

21:48.460 --> 21:50.460
Do you have a way of handling

21:50.460 --> 21:52.460
the class clown

21:52.460 --> 21:54.460
or the guy that heckles you

21:54.460 --> 21:56.460
or the girl or whatever?

21:56.460 --> 21:58.460
Some student is the most disruptive.

21:58.460 --> 22:00.460
That's actually me.

22:00.460 --> 22:02.460
I'm the class clown in class.

22:02.460 --> 22:04.460
Isn't it true that you're supposed on the first day

22:04.460 --> 22:06.460
of class to find the biggest student

22:06.460 --> 22:08.460
and beat him up?

22:08.460 --> 22:10.460
That's...

22:10.460 --> 22:12.460
That's what I've heard.

22:12.460 --> 22:14.460
Just fucking...

22:14.460 --> 22:16.460
Sharpen the edge of a toothbrush

22:16.460 --> 22:18.460
and you just shank him.

22:18.460 --> 22:20.460
Otherwise, you get a full two semesters.

22:20.460 --> 22:22.460
You're on the menu.

22:22.460 --> 22:24.460
I think

22:24.460 --> 22:26.460
my favorite teacher in high school

22:26.460 --> 22:28.460
was my chemistry teacher.

22:28.460 --> 22:30.460
I thought she was the one that...

22:30.460 --> 22:32.460
I connected with the most because

22:32.460 --> 22:34.460
it's so weird.

22:34.460 --> 22:36.460
The idea of...

22:36.460 --> 22:38.460
The idea of

22:38.460 --> 22:40.460
protons and electrons

22:40.460 --> 22:42.460
and fucking chemicals

22:42.460 --> 22:44.460
and reacting with each other.

22:44.460 --> 22:46.460
It's so...

22:46.460 --> 22:48.460
It's complicated.

22:48.460 --> 22:50.460
It's so...

22:50.460 --> 22:52.460
You summed it up so well there.

22:52.460 --> 22:54.460
No, no, no.

22:54.460 --> 22:56.460
That's my whole year class

22:56.460 --> 22:58.460
in a sentence fragment.

22:58.460 --> 23:00.460
It just all sounds like magic.

23:00.460 --> 23:02.460
I wasn't trying to explain magic to you

23:02.460 --> 23:04.460
the whole time. It's pretty fascinating.

23:04.460 --> 23:06.460
Yeah, no. It's a lot of fun.

23:06.460 --> 23:08.460
I'm a biology guy myself,

23:08.460 --> 23:10.460
but...

23:10.460 --> 23:12.460
Then we can be friends.

23:12.460 --> 23:14.460
You're like, biology's

23:14.460 --> 23:16.460
just like a weird theater play

23:16.460 --> 23:18.460
built on

23:18.460 --> 23:20.460
the set that I'm responsible for.

23:20.460 --> 23:22.460
Now, okay.

23:22.460 --> 23:24.460
Here's a real question for you.

23:24.460 --> 23:26.460
Okay.

23:26.460 --> 23:28.460
I want to know about, as a teacher,

23:28.460 --> 23:30.460
how much of your brain is occupied

23:30.460 --> 23:32.460
by that idea of

23:32.460 --> 23:34.460
you're a performer

23:34.460 --> 23:36.460
and, like, I'm killing, I'm dying,

23:36.460 --> 23:38.460
I'm losing them. I'm getting them back.

23:38.460 --> 23:40.460
Yeah.

23:40.460 --> 23:42.460
A lot.

23:42.460 --> 23:44.460
A lot.

23:44.460 --> 23:46.460
A lot.

23:46.460 --> 23:48.460
A lot.

23:48.460 --> 23:50.460
A lot.

23:50.460 --> 23:52.460
A lot.

23:52.460 --> 23:54.460
A lot.

23:54.460 --> 23:56.460
A lot.

23:56.460 --> 23:58.460
Yeah. A lot.

23:58.460 --> 24:00.460
Yeah.

24:00.460 --> 24:02.460
And how much does that drive what you're

24:02.460 --> 24:04.460
doing?

24:04.460 --> 24:06.460
Because I would think, if I were a teacher,

24:06.460 --> 24:08.460
that's why I'm not a teacher, because I would be like,

24:08.460 --> 24:10.460
okay, guys, 2 plus 2 equals,

24:10.460 --> 24:12.460
and I hear a yawn, I'm like, equals party!

24:12.460 --> 24:14.460
And that's not true.

24:14.460 --> 24:16.460
It doesn't equal that.

24:16.460 --> 24:18.460
No.

24:18.460 --> 24:20.460
But I would teach them that, because I'd be like, don't kill me.

24:20.460 --> 24:22.460
Yeah, no, it's, well,

24:22.460 --> 24:24.460
when I was a kid, I loved doing theater.

24:24.460 --> 24:26.460
So I do feel, and then,

24:26.460 --> 24:28.460
but then I also fell in love with science and studied science.

24:28.460 --> 24:30.460
So I do feel like it's sort of

24:30.460 --> 24:32.460
a bit of acting and a bit of science.

24:32.460 --> 24:34.460
So you have that awareness that you're like,

24:34.460 --> 24:36.460
you know, who am I presenting as?

24:36.460 --> 24:38.460
Like, I need to be a character that they can trust.

24:38.460 --> 24:40.460
Yeah.

24:40.460 --> 24:42.460
Well, I feel like, when I think about it,

24:42.460 --> 24:44.460
I feel like I'm definitely myself in front

24:44.460 --> 24:46.460
of my classroom. I'm really open to my kids.

24:46.460 --> 24:48.460
I try to be really honest

24:48.460 --> 24:50.460
about a lot of stuff.

24:50.460 --> 24:52.460
But I do feel like

24:52.460 --> 24:54.460
I sort of put on a character when I get

24:54.460 --> 24:56.460
to school every morning a little bit.

24:56.460 --> 24:58.460
Accent?

24:58.460 --> 25:00.460
I'm a lot more outgoing and

25:00.460 --> 25:02.460
humorous there

25:02.460 --> 25:04.460
than you're going to find out that I am

25:04.460 --> 25:06.460
tonight.

25:06.460 --> 25:08.460
I feel like the bow tie

25:08.460 --> 25:10.460
is part of that, but not to...

25:10.460 --> 25:12.460
Yeah, definitely. Absolutely.

25:12.460 --> 25:14.460
Because I'm thinking, running a simulation

25:14.460 --> 25:16.460
of my high school self and

25:16.460 --> 25:18.460
imagining myself being in your class.

25:18.460 --> 25:20.460
And my first thought,

25:20.460 --> 25:22.460
just looking at you

25:22.460 --> 25:24.460
without knowing you at all,

25:24.460 --> 25:26.460
I would be like, don't fuck with this guy.

25:26.460 --> 25:28.460
Oh, God, no.

25:28.460 --> 25:30.460
I don't think I've ever

25:30.460 --> 25:32.460
taught a student who thought that about me.

25:32.460 --> 25:34.460
Well, I...

25:34.460 --> 25:36.460
I think it's more like...

25:36.460 --> 25:38.460
I don't mean don't fuck with him because he can kick my ass.

25:38.460 --> 25:40.460
I mean, don't get on this guy's bad side

25:40.460 --> 25:42.460
because he's actually like...

25:42.460 --> 25:44.460
He's hardcore OG nerd.

25:44.460 --> 25:46.460
And like, he

25:46.460 --> 25:48.460
is going to pay huge

25:48.460 --> 25:50.460
dividends if you're...

25:50.460 --> 25:52.460
If you give him a minimal

25:52.460 --> 25:54.460
amount of attention.

25:54.460 --> 25:56.460
And he will leave you behind

25:56.460 --> 25:58.460
with the smart kids

25:58.460 --> 26:00.460
if you fuck around.

26:00.460 --> 26:02.460
That's a

26:02.460 --> 26:04.460
version of hierarchy that I

26:04.460 --> 26:06.460
would recognize. Keith gets really

26:06.460 --> 26:08.460
nice letters years later,

26:08.460 --> 26:10.460
even from students who thought his

26:10.460 --> 26:12.460
class was too hard or whatever.

26:12.460 --> 26:14.460
Like, it makes

26:14.460 --> 26:16.460
you cry sometimes, actually, to get

26:16.460 --> 26:18.460
really nice letters. I cry about a lot of things.

26:18.460 --> 26:20.460
That's true.

26:20.460 --> 26:22.460
I think in an American modern society

26:22.460 --> 26:24.460
about the bow tie, Tucker Carlson

26:24.460 --> 26:26.460
notwithstanding,

26:26.460 --> 26:28.460
the bow tie is sort of like, hey,

26:28.460 --> 26:30.460
you know what?

26:30.460 --> 26:32.460
Formal,

26:32.460 --> 26:34.460
but only

26:34.460 --> 26:36.460
in the sense that

26:36.460 --> 26:38.460
I had to be.

26:38.460 --> 26:40.460
I can't put my finger on it.

26:40.460 --> 26:42.460
Can you tie?

26:42.460 --> 26:44.460
You say you wear them all the time, right?

26:44.460 --> 26:46.460
Do you do it without looking or

26:46.460 --> 26:48.460
do you have to have a mirror?

26:48.460 --> 26:50.460
I can't do it with looking. I have

26:50.460 --> 26:52.460
terrible spatial reasoning.

26:52.460 --> 26:54.460
Left and right gets mixed up, so if I try

26:54.460 --> 26:56.460
to look in a mirror and do it, I

26:56.460 --> 26:58.460
strangle myself.

26:58.460 --> 27:00.460
Would it be a bullshit thing for me to ask

27:00.460 --> 27:02.460
for you to untie or bow tie and retie it?

27:02.460 --> 27:04.460
Because

27:04.460 --> 27:06.460
I have to have a mirror to tie a bow tie.

27:06.460 --> 27:08.460
A lot of people have never seen a bow tie

27:08.460 --> 27:10.460
be tied, including I'm speaking for myself.

27:10.460 --> 27:12.460
I should use my

27:12.460 --> 27:14.460
eye statements. I have never seen a bow tie

27:14.460 --> 27:16.460
be tied.

27:16.460 --> 27:18.460
Well, I'm so glad I could be here to do this

27:18.460 --> 27:20.460
thing.

27:20.460 --> 27:22.460
I will say a couple of great things about

27:22.460 --> 27:24.460
bow ties over neck ties.

27:24.460 --> 27:26.460
Can't

27:26.460 --> 27:28.460
spill on it.

27:28.460 --> 27:30.460
Oh, okay.

27:30.460 --> 27:32.460
Never mind.

27:32.460 --> 27:34.460
No.

27:34.460 --> 27:36.460
Get in it.

27:36.460 --> 27:38.460
This is...

27:40.460 --> 27:42.460
I'm so not going to be able to do

27:42.460 --> 27:44.460
this.

27:44.460 --> 27:46.460
I'm like, I'm seriously

27:46.460 --> 27:48.460
shaking.

27:48.460 --> 27:50.460
Oh, well, that made it

27:50.460 --> 27:52.460
worse.

27:54.460 --> 27:56.460
These people came from all over the world

27:56.460 --> 28:02.460
to watch you tie your bow tie.

28:08.460 --> 28:10.460
Tie, tie, tie, tie, tie.

28:10.460 --> 28:12.460
Tie.

28:12.460 --> 28:14.460
Tie.

28:20.460 --> 28:22.460
Yeah.

28:22.460 --> 28:24.460
Yeah, baby.

28:24.460 --> 28:34.280
I would say, I would say, mic drop, that is so hard to do, I would say if you were ever

28:34.280 --> 28:41.360
dying in class, just untie your tie and do that, and then tell them all to sit down.

28:41.360 --> 28:45.520
I think Keith, that was the most show busy thing that's ever happened on our show.

28:45.520 --> 28:46.520
Awesome.

28:46.520 --> 28:51.640
And that's why I married him too, because can you imagine that dexterity put to other

28:51.640 --> 28:52.640
uses.

28:52.640 --> 28:53.640
Uh-oh.

28:53.640 --> 28:54.640
Uh-oh.

28:54.640 --> 29:02.320
I'm not sure exactly what you mean, but that sounds like a hand.

29:02.320 --> 29:06.720
The English major's interpretation of the...

29:06.720 --> 29:10.800
I'll get it later.

29:10.800 --> 29:15.280
I hope you guys don't mind sharing the stage with maybe some pilgrims tonight, because

29:15.280 --> 29:22.180
the show is ending, and so the audience is packed with people who have come, like the

29:22.180 --> 29:27.200
flung themselves from all four corners of the earth, and how many people came from another

29:27.200 --> 29:28.200
country tonight?

29:28.200 --> 29:29.200
Yeah.

29:29.200 --> 29:30.200
That's great.

29:30.200 --> 29:31.200
Wow.

29:31.200 --> 29:34.800
How many people came from like a long way away in the U.S. or Canada?

29:34.800 --> 29:35.800
Yeah.

29:35.800 --> 29:36.800
Wow.

29:36.800 --> 29:38.800
That's a bit more believable.

29:38.800 --> 29:41.800
How many people wore red tonight?

29:41.800 --> 29:47.000
How many people can tie a bow tie without looking?

29:47.000 --> 29:49.400
Oh, see, they're lying.

29:49.400 --> 29:53.200
But the first person that comes to mind that I met at the drawing room, which I got in

29:53.200 --> 29:57.560
my car from the Rick and Morty office, and I literally hit the wrong button on my Tesla

29:57.560 --> 30:03.880
screen, and I ended up going to what was my old home, which is a couple blocks from the

30:03.880 --> 30:05.680
drawing room, and I...

30:05.680 --> 30:10.440
So I went into the drawing room for the first time in like six months, and it was just filled

30:10.440 --> 30:11.440
with...

30:11.440 --> 30:16.280
I'm going to call it neurodiversity.

30:16.280 --> 30:23.400
And proudly so, and really passionate people, like people just thanking me for doing the

30:23.400 --> 30:26.760
podcast, being so respectful and amazing.

30:26.760 --> 30:30.240
And one of the most inspiring things, by the way, not to get off on a tangent, but was actually

30:30.240 --> 30:33.440
the drawing room regulars, the people that...

30:33.440 --> 30:39.360
My social anxiety was like, fuck, these people must hate me for fucking being a magnet for

30:39.360 --> 30:41.760
outside interlopers and all these things.

30:41.760 --> 30:50.040
But some of the more working class elements of them were, because they talked to you guys,

30:50.040 --> 30:59.240
they were at the end, they were going like, hey, man, talk to those people, and the shit

30:59.240 --> 31:01.880
they say about you, fucking cheers, man.

31:01.880 --> 31:06.600
I was like, that's you guys, you're nice.

31:06.600 --> 31:11.840
You sold me to these guys who... fuck them.

31:11.840 --> 31:12.840
They're not here.

31:12.840 --> 31:21.480
But anyways, thank you, and every single Harmontown fan as a matter of tradition, their introduction

31:21.480 --> 31:22.480
is always...

31:22.480 --> 31:23.480
I'm so sorry.

31:23.480 --> 31:24.480
I don't mean to interrupt you.

31:24.480 --> 31:25.480
I hate that you're...

31:25.480 --> 31:29.480
I'm doing this to you, but my name is so and so.

31:29.480 --> 31:36.040
They come in so low, you almost want to punch them, but you don't, because you understand

31:36.040 --> 31:40.120
that is exactly what I would do, that's exactly how I would feel, and so many of you came

31:40.120 --> 31:41.760
up to me tonight.

31:41.760 --> 31:46.440
One of you in particular came up to me in the middle of my conversation with someone

31:46.440 --> 31:51.400
else and just said, I'd like to talk to you about autism.

31:51.400 --> 31:55.240
That was your introduction, and I said to that person, do you know who the guest is

31:55.240 --> 31:56.240
tonight?

31:56.240 --> 31:57.440
No.

31:57.440 --> 32:01.040
It's Steve Silberman, and they were like, oh my God.

32:01.040 --> 32:08.680
Well, let me tell you this, being Steve Silberman, I have a lot of autistic friends, and they

32:08.680 --> 32:16.800
thank you so much, particularly for Abed, because it gave them a person who they could

32:16.800 --> 32:19.880
really relate to in visible media.

32:19.880 --> 32:25.720
I wrote a character based on my friend, almost punching Downish, like I was like, hey, my

32:25.720 --> 32:34.560
funny friend, and then because I was narcissistic and hadn't been abused enough by online, I

32:34.560 --> 32:42.480
was constantly googling myself and my show, and what I saw was this new thing called the

32:42.480 --> 32:51.000
autistic community saying, we love this Abed character, and I, because of greed and selfishness

32:51.000 --> 32:57.320
and desire to do a good job by these people, I was like, what do they mean?

32:57.320 --> 32:58.520
Why do they like him?

32:58.520 --> 33:01.800
And they would say, he doesn't have Pinocchio syndrome.

33:01.800 --> 33:05.800
They would say all these things, and it was like, oh my God, what is this thing?

33:05.800 --> 33:06.800
What's Pinocchio syndrome?

33:06.800 --> 33:12.520
Well, it's just this idea that if you're the data character on Star Trek, if you're these

33:12.520 --> 33:13.520
characters.

33:13.520 --> 33:14.520
I want to be a real boy.

33:14.520 --> 33:15.520
Yeah.

33:15.520 --> 33:20.000
Oh God, if only I could give someone a hug, then I'd be the greatest person ever.

33:20.000 --> 33:26.000
That's like, I don't mean to put down hugs.

33:26.000 --> 33:38.280
Well, I don't mean, if that is someone's journey, I don't mean to diminish that, but there is

33:38.280 --> 33:43.440
a very, very large community of people that are like, actually, this doesn't feel that

33:43.440 --> 33:45.920
much like a disability.

33:45.920 --> 33:51.600
I'm constantly watching you people give each other hugs, and then run away crying from

33:51.600 --> 33:52.600
each other.

33:52.600 --> 33:54.280
It kind of all comes out in the wash.

33:54.280 --> 34:00.720
I basically am like behind this piece of plexiglass, which sometimes is an inconvenience, but overall

34:00.720 --> 34:02.200
seems to avoid a lot of trouble.

34:02.200 --> 34:05.160
I seem to be much more efficacious at my job.

34:05.160 --> 34:10.280
I don't understand why you people feel sorry for me and want to cure me of this plexiglass.

34:10.280 --> 34:12.240
That seems a little stupid.

34:12.240 --> 34:17.000
And so they get a little annoyed, they see a character in a show that's kind of resonating

34:17.000 --> 34:22.040
with them because they're like, I'm a robot, or I'm a puppet, or I'm a wooden clock, or

34:22.040 --> 34:24.080
I'm a fucking flying carpet.

34:24.080 --> 34:26.480
I'm looking at the carpet.

34:26.480 --> 34:30.960
There's no such thing as a flying carpet that's like an autism thing.

34:30.960 --> 34:31.960
You guys saw Aladdin?

34:31.960 --> 34:34.960
That carpet's autistic.

34:34.960 --> 34:39.120
It'll take you anywhere, but it doesn't care.

34:39.120 --> 34:44.400
But I would watch them, and they would go like, I love Abed because he doesn't have

34:44.400 --> 34:45.400
Pinocchio syndrome.

34:45.400 --> 34:46.400
He doesn't do this.

34:46.400 --> 34:47.400
He doesn't do that.

34:47.400 --> 34:49.680
And I was like, I want these people on my side.

34:49.680 --> 34:51.680
I want to do right by them.

34:51.680 --> 34:58.840
And then I took tests online because I wanted to learn the details of, like, I wanted to

34:58.840 --> 35:02.320
send them signals, I'm on your side.

35:02.320 --> 35:06.800
I want to be like, if you were like writing Sons of Anarchy, like let me take a test about

35:06.800 --> 35:12.160
motorcycles, like, oh, my handbrake gives me skin burns, or whatever, I'm like, whatever.

35:12.160 --> 35:14.480
Give me fucking money, cha-ching.

35:14.480 --> 35:20.160
I was only doing it through greed and narcissism, I was like, let me, I like this community.

35:20.160 --> 35:22.160
I want your approval.

35:22.160 --> 35:26.480
Well, you know, I went through the same thing while writing Neurotribes because I started

35:26.480 --> 35:29.240
writing about autism as a science writer for Wired.

35:29.240 --> 35:33.280
But as soon as I did a bunch of research, going all the way back through the Holocaust

35:33.280 --> 35:36.320
and everything, I realized, I like these people.

35:36.320 --> 35:38.440
These people are on a journey towards autonomy.

35:38.440 --> 35:40.400
You said the people that created America.

35:40.400 --> 35:41.400
Right, exactly.

35:41.400 --> 35:43.600
A journey towards autonomy?

35:43.600 --> 35:44.600
You said?

35:44.600 --> 35:45.600
Yes.

35:45.600 --> 35:46.600
Explain that to me.

35:46.600 --> 35:50.800
What I mean is autistic adults for most of the 20th century were like living and dying

35:50.800 --> 35:52.440
in institutions.

35:52.440 --> 35:56.560
So and everybody was talking about autism behind their backs.

35:56.560 --> 35:58.560
So I was like, oh, what causes autism?

35:58.560 --> 36:01.800
Believe it or not, most autistic people don't wake up in the morning and say, I wonder what

36:01.800 --> 36:03.520
caused my autism.

36:03.520 --> 36:07.080
You know, they think about how they can have fun or how they can have friends or how they

36:07.080 --> 36:10.760
can fall in love or how they can get a job or et cetera.

36:10.760 --> 36:15.640
And so I wanted to send them signals in my book that I was on their side too.

36:15.640 --> 36:20.720
And so that's why my book sort of took off with the blessing of the autistic community

36:20.720 --> 36:22.280
for which I'm very, very grateful.

36:22.280 --> 36:24.840
Yeah, it was super successful in that regard.

36:24.840 --> 36:25.840
Yeah.

36:25.840 --> 36:32.440
And there are, anyways, but sorry, like I was describing this person who came up and said,

36:32.440 --> 36:33.640
I want to talk about autism.

36:33.640 --> 36:35.920
And she literally did not know that you were the guest tonight.

36:35.920 --> 36:39.960
And so I would be remiss of like, I think that we should bring her up.

36:39.960 --> 36:45.360
Yes, I spoke to her before you did because I was at the drawing room earlier and she

36:45.360 --> 36:50.040
said like, I think it was her first episode where you were the guest and like, yeah, we

36:50.040 --> 36:51.040
have to bring her up.

36:51.040 --> 36:54.640
I don't want to put too much pressure on her, but I also don't want her to live the rest

36:54.640 --> 36:58.080
of her life going like, I wanted to talk to him about autism and then the autism guy was

36:58.080 --> 36:59.560
on the show, whatever.

36:59.560 --> 37:01.240
So is it Jessica, right?

37:01.240 --> 37:02.240
Jennifer.

37:02.240 --> 37:03.240
Jennifer.

37:03.240 --> 37:04.240
Jennifer is very close.

37:04.240 --> 37:05.240
Carrasquillo.

37:05.240 --> 37:06.240
All right.

37:06.240 --> 37:07.240
Jennifer Carrasquillo.

37:07.240 --> 37:08.240
All right.

37:08.240 --> 37:11.760
But really, Jessica, you go by Jessica mostly.

37:11.760 --> 37:12.760
Whoa.

37:12.760 --> 37:13.760
Awesome.

37:23.760 --> 37:25.240
Thank you, Rob.

37:25.240 --> 37:28.600
Nice, like James Bond kind of tuck and roll on the stage.

37:28.600 --> 37:29.600
That was very good.

37:29.600 --> 37:31.600
That was at Tobias Yunke.

37:31.600 --> 37:37.600
All right.

37:37.600 --> 37:39.600
Let's talk about autism.

37:39.600 --> 37:40.600
No pressure.

37:40.600 --> 37:44.840
Jennifer, first off, you were a behavior specialist.

37:44.840 --> 37:45.840
What's it again?

37:45.840 --> 37:46.840
Yeah.

37:46.840 --> 37:47.840
Use your microphone.

37:47.840 --> 37:48.840
What you said.

37:48.840 --> 37:49.840
What you said.

37:49.840 --> 37:50.840
What you said.

37:50.840 --> 37:52.840
Say it like the way that you know how to say it better than I do.

37:52.840 --> 37:55.440
I'll be your specialist.

37:55.440 --> 37:56.440
Yeah.

37:56.440 --> 37:57.440
Woo.

37:57.440 --> 37:59.800
What does that mean?

37:59.800 --> 38:05.160
You work for companies, corporations, and you deal with people, like break it down for

38:05.160 --> 38:06.160
me.

38:06.160 --> 38:07.160
I specialize in autism.

38:07.160 --> 38:08.640
I direct all the autism.

38:08.640 --> 38:10.640
I'm an autism director.

38:10.640 --> 38:12.280
Use the mic like a girl.

38:12.280 --> 38:14.480
Who are the people who you work with usually?

38:14.480 --> 38:15.480
No.

38:15.480 --> 38:16.480
No.

38:16.480 --> 38:19.960
I work primarily.

38:19.960 --> 38:20.960
Use your microphone.

38:20.960 --> 38:29.280
I work primarily with children on the autism spectrum from the ages of 0 to 11, or 11,

38:29.280 --> 38:36.680
and the services are pretty broad.

38:36.680 --> 38:37.680
It's education.

38:37.680 --> 38:38.680
Yeah.

38:38.680 --> 38:47.400
If you could make a wish that would make the world better for the people you work with,

38:47.400 --> 38:48.400
what would it be?

38:48.400 --> 38:49.400
Oh, that's a really good question.

38:49.400 --> 38:50.400
That's a great question.

38:50.400 --> 38:51.400
It's a fucking phenomenal question.

38:51.400 --> 38:52.400
That's why I love him.

38:52.400 --> 38:53.400
Oh, my God.

38:53.400 --> 39:05.160
It would really be about creating not really so much the contrived environment from the

39:05.160 --> 39:13.800
ages of the educational ages, but beyond that, and figuring out where people fit into society,

39:13.800 --> 39:22.480
because I think there's just so many expectations of us that we all have to fit into this different

39:22.480 --> 39:23.480
environment.

39:23.480 --> 39:26.080
I don't fucking know what I'm talking about.

39:26.080 --> 39:27.080
Actually, no.

39:27.080 --> 39:28.080
You were going to a good place.

39:28.080 --> 39:29.080
You know what I mean?

39:29.080 --> 39:40.480
I feel like we're all channeled into these very specific ways that we go, and it's sometimes

39:40.480 --> 39:48.600
the people that have the ability to contribute the most to these different areas are just

39:48.600 --> 39:54.200
kind of overlooked, and that's the cool thing about autism and services like what we do

39:54.200 --> 39:59.280
is we make sure that they don't get overlooked, and we make sure that these people that have

39:59.280 --> 40:05.400
these incredible contributions to everything have a voice.

40:05.400 --> 40:06.400
That's awesome.

40:06.400 --> 40:07.400
Excellent.

40:07.400 --> 40:16.840
That's like a big theme of your book is the idea of accepting neurodiversity, and therefore

40:16.840 --> 40:26.560
the way a society could react, it's basically building, it's going, oh, don't we all recognize

40:26.560 --> 40:31.800
that all of our brains are like these crazy fireworks, and then therefore wouldn't an

40:31.800 --> 40:41.720
ideal society allow for even the most fringe kind of conduits between the weirdest places

40:41.720 --> 40:45.560
of thought up into where they can provide people with help?

40:45.560 --> 40:46.560
That's true.

40:46.560 --> 40:51.640
I think a lot of times stuff like art and comedy and science has been sort of unofficial

40:51.640 --> 40:53.640
channels of that information.

40:53.640 --> 40:54.640
That's it, yes.

40:54.640 --> 40:55.640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

40:55.640 --> 40:58.800
Yeah, comedy, TV, writing, all the arts, the sciences, the writing, I don't know how

40:58.800 --> 40:59.800
broad you want to go.

40:59.800 --> 41:02.800
It's like it's weird people going, can you hear me?

41:02.800 --> 41:04.280
David Lynch, hello.

41:04.280 --> 41:05.280
Right, exactly.

41:05.280 --> 41:06.880
I mean, Diak knows him.

41:06.880 --> 41:13.840
It's like, David Lynch is, I was like not a fan until somebody said, he's autistic,

41:13.840 --> 41:19.240
and I'm like, I'm a fan, because then I look back at every David Lynch film that I was

41:19.240 --> 41:24.680
like, come on already, and then I was like, oh, he's banging on a pipe and going like,

41:24.680 --> 41:25.680
hello?

41:25.680 --> 41:29.040
It's me, David Lynch, can you hear me?

41:29.040 --> 41:34.480
Or for that matter, David Byrne, who's a show American Utopia, and I like Talking Hedge

41:34.480 --> 41:35.480
finally.

41:35.480 --> 41:42.400
Yeah, and the first time I saw him was in 1977, I'm really old, okay, Boomer.

41:42.400 --> 41:45.560
At Oberlin.

41:45.560 --> 41:49.080
And the first time I saw him, I thought, why is that guy so nervous?

41:49.080 --> 41:50.080
He's so nervous.

41:50.080 --> 41:51.080
David Byrne is autistic.

41:51.080 --> 41:52.080
He's so nervous.

41:52.080 --> 41:58.240
Yeah, he's autistic, or he has Asperger syndrome, which he talks about now.

41:58.240 --> 42:04.240
But the amazing thing about American Utopia is totally uplifting, totally beautiful.

42:04.240 --> 42:09.440
Everybody playing music while they're dancing on stage, the antidote to a lot of what's

42:09.440 --> 42:13.160
going on in this country right now.

42:13.160 --> 42:20.880
It was a very humanizing show, and that's coming from somebody with a neurodivergent

42:20.880 --> 42:21.880
mind.

42:21.880 --> 42:22.880
Yeah.

42:22.880 --> 42:24.960
Can I take you to a weird, uncomfortable place?

42:24.960 --> 42:28.280
Because I think the last time that we talked, maybe I was having dinner with you in San

42:28.280 --> 42:34.720
Francisco with Cody, and I think maybe the election had just happened, and so we were

42:34.720 --> 42:39.760
like hippies in San Francisco going like, okay, I guess the world's ending now.

42:39.760 --> 42:40.760
Right.

42:40.760 --> 42:41.760
And it did, by the way.

42:41.760 --> 42:42.760
It did.

42:42.760 --> 42:59.600
But now, I guess something that I have perceived as a tragedy is that whereas in the past,

42:59.600 --> 43:04.240
neurodiversity built the internet, neurodiversity gave us everything that we were using.

43:04.240 --> 43:05.920
Swipe left, swipe right.

43:05.920 --> 43:07.560
Who comes up with that?

43:07.560 --> 43:10.880
The answer is, anyway, where are we all?

43:10.880 --> 43:13.520
We're all moving in that direction.

43:13.520 --> 43:19.960
Now that the infrastructure has been in place, and all of society is on the internet to the

43:19.960 --> 43:27.680
point where your presidents are chosen by the internet, my biggest frustration is my

43:27.680 --> 43:31.440
brothers on the spectrum, and I'm not diagnosing myself.

43:31.440 --> 43:40.320
I'm saying my people, my neurodivergent people, by virtue of their Han Solo mentality, they're

43:40.320 --> 43:49.520
like, I don't fucking like think like anybody, like those folks are now, whereas in the past

43:49.520 --> 44:00.080
they were the builders of what we have, now they are simply sitting online, they're now,

44:00.080 --> 44:10.080
I watch them, the only way they can express their neurodivergence is by going, oh, butter

44:10.080 --> 44:11.080
emails.

44:11.080 --> 44:12.080
Yeah.

44:12.080 --> 44:22.200
I'm like, dude, you don't, am I wrong about that?

44:22.200 --> 44:29.360
Well, I mean, there are always a lot of people watching television, but yeah, I mean, I know

44:29.360 --> 44:30.360
what you mean.

44:30.360 --> 44:34.360
I'm not going to take part in this system, like, oh yeah, that classically, yeah, your

44:34.360 --> 44:38.080
psychology has not taken part in any system, however, now the definition of not taking

44:38.080 --> 44:42.560
part in the system has now become part of this fucking death star, and I'm like, oh

44:42.560 --> 44:49.360
no, I was 25 once, oh fuck, and I just like, I recede to my swimming pool, I don't know.

44:49.360 --> 44:54.720
No, I know, you know, in the early days of Wired when we were all in this one huge room

44:54.720 --> 44:59.920
with dub music playing and everybody was high and had hickeys on their necks, we thought

44:59.920 --> 45:05.640
the internet was going to absolutely unleash human creativity, and unfortunately what it

45:05.640 --> 45:08.000
unleashed was Russian propaganda.

45:08.000 --> 45:13.840
We thought that the internet was like bound, everybody assumed that almost in a shameful

45:13.840 --> 45:18.880
way, I think we were all like, god damn, when's the government going to catch on to the fact

45:18.880 --> 45:28.760
that once someone in Saudi Arabia can just sell you jewelry in Montana that everything,

45:28.760 --> 45:33.320
racism's going to stop, like, everything's going to stop, like, it's going to pull the

45:33.320 --> 45:41.080
plug on everything that's been driving human, like, jingoism, and I was like, it was the

45:41.080 --> 45:48.200
opposite, it was the opposite, we were like, oh, the internet made us more racist, wow.

45:48.200 --> 45:50.200
Well, not us, but yes, people.

45:50.200 --> 45:52.200
I may be more racist.

45:52.200 --> 45:54.800
Do you feel more racist?

45:54.800 --> 45:59.480
It's certainly, you know what, it's made me a bigger fucking dick, it's made me more

45:59.480 --> 46:05.040
hateful, it's made me more divisive, it's made me go, there are good people and there

46:05.040 --> 46:07.760
are bad people, I never felt that way before.

46:07.760 --> 46:13.400
Yeah, I agree with you, it's made me a worse Buddhist, because I have regular, sort of,

46:13.400 --> 46:21.320
entire iron fantasies involving certain… We spoke earlier, you and, like, over the

46:21.320 --> 46:25.240
last few weeks, people were kind of coming to the two Harmontown because it's going

46:25.240 --> 46:32.440
to close soon, we meet a lot of people that talk about, like, why they listen to our weird,

46:32.440 --> 46:38.760
unprepared, stupid show, and it means a lot, it means different things to different people.

46:38.760 --> 46:44.560
What makes you as someone, you know, that's what you do, what draws you to it, and what

46:44.560 --> 46:48.560
made you come out to go see it, because a lot of people came from, like, far and wide

46:48.560 --> 46:53.200
to come tonight, which is really, really cool and kind of blows my mind, like, what is it

46:53.200 --> 46:59.400
for you personally that this did or does or didn't do?

46:59.400 --> 47:03.760
Like, what's your connection to this?

47:03.760 --> 47:08.960
I just don't really have a lot of personal connections overall, so it's…

47:08.960 --> 47:09.960
Boo!

47:09.960 --> 47:10.960
Unacceptable!

47:10.960 --> 47:12.960
I just ruin everything.

47:12.960 --> 47:14.920
I'm just going to leave.

47:14.920 --> 47:16.920
What's wrong with you?

47:16.920 --> 47:23.080
So it's cool to just, yeah, it's cool to just, like, kind of get up and be able to

47:23.080 --> 47:28.280
say whatever I have to say, and nobody really connects that to who I am or anything like

47:28.280 --> 47:35.160
that, it's just, I don't know, this, you can just be who you are, it's this existential

47:35.160 --> 47:39.480
sort of thing where you can be wherever, and it's great, and you can do that with this

47:39.480 --> 47:44.160
whole Harmontown thing, because Harmontown doesn't have a location and just is.

47:44.160 --> 47:49.200
So it's kind of a community, and, God, that sounds so dumb.

47:49.200 --> 47:50.200
No, it's good.

47:50.200 --> 47:57.000
But it's cool, it's a community, and that's what, that's what I like about it.

47:57.000 --> 48:04.120
And I mean, so, yeah, that's it.

48:04.120 --> 48:05.440
I like the D&D.

48:05.440 --> 48:07.440
You came for it.

48:07.440 --> 48:11.120
Yeah, I like the D&D, too, that's cool.

48:11.120 --> 48:12.120
Oh, no, no, I didn't.

48:12.120 --> 48:13.120
I was trying that.

48:13.120 --> 48:16.120
But you came all the way from Pennsylvania.

48:16.120 --> 48:19.680
We've met people that came from Vancouver, Japan.

48:19.680 --> 48:20.680
Japan?

48:20.680 --> 48:21.680
Texas, England.

48:21.680 --> 48:28.560
Like, I got the Japan, like, can we keep the carousel moving, and like, can we thank

48:28.560 --> 48:29.560
Jen?

48:29.560 --> 48:30.560
Thank you, Jennifer.

48:30.560 --> 48:31.560
Thank you.

48:31.560 --> 48:39.040
I'm not good at, like, dismissing people, but it's, we got to cavalcade here.

48:39.040 --> 48:40.040
Thank you, Jennifer.

48:40.040 --> 48:41.040
That was awesome.

48:41.040 --> 48:42.040
I didn't have...

48:42.040 --> 48:43.040
Yeah.

48:43.040 --> 48:44.040
Yay!

48:44.040 --> 48:46.440
There were other people.

48:46.440 --> 48:47.440
Awesome.

48:47.440 --> 48:52.440
Who, who, someone actually came from Japan?

48:52.440 --> 48:53.440
Right over here.

48:53.440 --> 48:54.440
Whoa.

48:54.440 --> 48:55.440
That doesn't sound Japanese at all.

48:55.440 --> 48:57.440
Like, it sounds like he's from...

48:57.440 --> 48:58.440
It sounds like...

48:58.440 --> 48:59.440
Kanoka Park.

48:59.440 --> 49:00.440
Well, that's a...

49:00.440 --> 49:03.440
It is me, but I'm not the person from Japan.

49:03.440 --> 49:04.440
It's Ashlyn, right?

49:04.440 --> 49:05.440
Oh, wow.

49:05.440 --> 49:06.440
Yeah.

49:06.440 --> 49:07.440
Ashlyn, you want to come up?

49:07.440 --> 49:08.440
Ashlyn, bring it up.

49:08.440 --> 49:09.440
Oh, wow.

49:09.440 --> 49:10.440
Little kimono.

49:10.440 --> 49:11.440
I love it.

49:11.440 --> 49:12.440
Wow.

49:12.440 --> 49:13.440
Yeah.

49:13.440 --> 49:17.440
Excellent.

49:17.440 --> 49:18.440
Hello.

49:18.440 --> 49:19.440
Yo.

49:19.440 --> 49:22.440
There you are.

49:22.440 --> 49:23.440
Holy smoke.

49:23.440 --> 49:28.440
I mean, for our non, like, video listeners, this is a great kimono.

49:28.440 --> 49:30.440
It's the full rig.

49:30.440 --> 49:31.440
Yeah.

49:31.440 --> 49:32.440
Yeah.

49:32.440 --> 49:34.440
With a rear-facing kabuki face.

49:34.440 --> 49:37.440
Actually, this is a, it's a no-mask, which is a...

49:37.440 --> 49:38.440
No.

49:38.440 --> 49:41.440
No is like the predecessor of kabuki theater.

49:41.440 --> 49:44.440
It's a classical Japanese form of theater.

49:44.440 --> 49:45.440
It's almost intertwined.

49:45.440 --> 49:47.440
Like, it's almost like a...

49:47.440 --> 49:50.440
Like, Shintoism is the indigenous religion there.

49:50.440 --> 49:51.440
It's animistic.

49:51.440 --> 49:52.440
And it's kind of like...

49:52.440 --> 49:55.440
It's almost like a religious ceremony as much as it is a performance.

49:55.440 --> 49:56.440
It's really boring.

49:56.440 --> 50:00.440
Wait, so are you visiting from Japan or were you visiting Japan?

50:00.440 --> 50:01.440
No, I live there.

50:01.440 --> 50:02.440
Okay.

50:02.440 --> 50:03.440
Where do you live?

50:03.440 --> 50:05.440
I live outside of Osaka.

50:05.440 --> 50:06.440
Oh, nice.

50:06.440 --> 50:07.440
Yeah.

50:07.440 --> 50:08.440
I've been there for 11 years.

50:08.440 --> 50:10.440
I went there for a grad school.

50:10.440 --> 50:11.440
And I never came back.

50:11.440 --> 50:12.440
Are you fluent in Japanese?

50:12.440 --> 50:13.440
Yes.

50:13.440 --> 50:15.440
That means yes.

50:15.440 --> 50:18.440
I mean, I knew that one.

50:18.440 --> 50:21.440
I mean, I knew that one.

50:21.440 --> 50:22.440
Can I ask you a question?

50:22.440 --> 50:23.440
Yeah, of course.

50:23.440 --> 50:37.440
What's your favorite really weird Japanese food that you can't get here?

50:37.440 --> 50:38.440
Mice.

50:38.440 --> 50:40.440
It's called...

50:40.440 --> 50:42.440
That's a perpetuated stereotype.

50:42.440 --> 50:44.440
It's called shirako.

50:44.440 --> 50:48.440
And it's like fish's testicles.

50:48.440 --> 50:50.440
But they're inside the fish.

50:50.440 --> 50:51.440
So it's like...

50:51.440 --> 50:52.440
Yeah.

50:52.440 --> 50:54.440
And you can eat them raw or you can eat them cooked.

50:54.440 --> 50:56.440
And they're really tasty.

50:56.440 --> 50:57.440
Shirako.

50:57.440 --> 50:58.440
Can't get them here.

50:58.440 --> 50:59.440
Oh, yesume nasai.

50:59.440 --> 51:01.440
Oh, yesume nasai.

51:01.440 --> 51:03.440
Fish have testicles?

51:03.440 --> 51:05.440
They're inside the body.

51:05.440 --> 51:06.440
What the fuck?

51:06.440 --> 51:08.440
And so...

51:08.440 --> 51:11.440
That's why I'm not a life scientist.

51:11.440 --> 51:12.440
I'm a physical scientist.

51:12.440 --> 51:15.440
Yeah, I don't want to know nothing about that.

51:15.440 --> 51:17.440
I would avoid that subject.

51:17.440 --> 51:19.440
How does the stuff get out?

51:19.440 --> 51:20.440
No, I won't know.

51:20.440 --> 51:21.440
I mean, yeah.

51:21.440 --> 51:25.440
Lots of roe or like eggs as well are tasty.

51:25.440 --> 51:28.440
Kazunoko herring roe is another favorite of mine.

51:28.440 --> 51:30.440
What is the thing on the back called?

51:30.440 --> 51:33.440
The little pouchy business on the back?

51:33.440 --> 51:34.440
Yeah, it's a little...

51:34.440 --> 51:36.440
I have always wondered like, what is the purpose of this?

51:36.440 --> 51:38.440
Because you can't exactly put things in it.

51:38.440 --> 51:41.440
So this is taiko or like drum obi.

51:41.440 --> 51:49.440
But the obi is this long piece of material that you have to expertly weave around yourself.

51:49.440 --> 51:52.440
And so, yeah, what is the purpose of this thing?

51:52.440 --> 51:59.440
I've often thought, I think it's like to make you sit straight or something.

51:59.440 --> 52:00.440
Interesting.

52:00.440 --> 52:01.440
It kind of looks cool.

52:01.440 --> 52:08.440
The thing about Japanese kimono is like, the whole thing is like, you need straight lines.

52:08.440 --> 52:17.440
And I think that speaks to like the body type of the people who develop this tradition, right?

52:17.440 --> 52:22.440
So like, in Europe you have the, I don't even know what era this would be, like Baroque,

52:22.440 --> 52:28.440
but Victorian maybe, just tight waist and like voluptuous curves.

52:28.440 --> 52:32.440
That's the total opposite of what you're going for with kimono.

52:32.440 --> 52:37.440
So I actually have to like, I mean, I don't have big breasts, so that's not a problem.

52:37.440 --> 52:41.440
But I put like, they have like a special pad that you put on your back

52:41.440 --> 52:46.440
and wrap your waist with a towel so that like, this line is straight.

52:46.440 --> 52:49.440
You just want straight lines.

52:49.440 --> 52:50.440
Everything is straight.

52:50.440 --> 52:52.440
I love those.

52:52.440 --> 52:54.440
Some of my favorite lines are straight.

52:54.440 --> 52:59.440
If anything, if anything's curvy, that's actually like a...

52:59.440 --> 53:00.440
Well, it's just not the style.

53:00.440 --> 53:01.440
Yeah, I don't know.

53:01.440 --> 53:06.440
Well, they don't, I mean, they don't really have like curves so much as maybe your friends.

53:06.440 --> 53:08.440
I'm tripping out on the face and the back of my head.

53:08.440 --> 53:10.440
I know, me too.

53:10.440 --> 53:12.440
You're kind of never of duty.

53:12.440 --> 53:13.440
Yeah, I know.

53:13.440 --> 53:16.440
Is the word kimono...

53:16.440 --> 53:17.440
Kimono.

53:17.440 --> 53:21.440
Is that referencing a whole style or just the garment?

53:21.440 --> 53:25.440
Kimono, ki means wear and mono means thing.

53:25.440 --> 53:27.440
So it's just things you wear.

53:27.440 --> 53:29.440
So it is like a, it's a style.

53:29.440 --> 53:31.440
It's like lakosenostri, this thing of ours.

53:31.440 --> 53:33.440
It's just garments.

53:33.440 --> 53:34.440
It's just garments.

53:34.440 --> 53:37.440
Yeah, but I mean, it is a certain style of garment.

53:37.440 --> 53:41.440
Now, do you rock a kimono just around town or is this a special offense?

53:41.440 --> 53:42.440
Sometimes.

53:42.440 --> 53:44.440
Well, this, I mean, this is special.

53:44.440 --> 53:47.440
But yeah, I do wear kimono sometimes around town.

53:47.440 --> 53:51.440
So you're visiting from Japan and you're going back home soon?

53:51.440 --> 53:53.440
Yeah, in a week.

53:53.440 --> 53:55.440
Home is Osaka for you, or outside of Osaka?

53:55.440 --> 53:56.440
Yes, yeah.

53:56.440 --> 53:57.440
That's awesome.

53:57.440 --> 53:58.440
Yeah, I came here.

53:58.440 --> 54:05.440
Okay, so you came up to me at the drawing room and you gave me a folded piece of paper and you said there's a story.

54:05.440 --> 54:06.440
Yeah, there's a story.

54:06.440 --> 54:07.440
Origami.

54:07.440 --> 54:09.440
I know, I know.

54:09.440 --> 54:11.440
Pretty entry level.

54:11.440 --> 54:12.440
I know.

54:12.440 --> 54:14.440
I do origami.

54:14.440 --> 54:16.440
I know it's just that, yeah.

54:16.440 --> 54:18.440
I made a floor.

54:18.440 --> 54:20.440
A tatami.

54:20.440 --> 54:21.440
Or a wall.

54:21.440 --> 54:23.440
So that was just, that was a copy.

54:23.440 --> 54:24.440
Right.

54:24.440 --> 54:25.440
I brought my own.

54:25.440 --> 54:26.440
You said you had a story.

54:26.440 --> 54:27.440
Yes, I have a story to tell.

54:27.440 --> 54:29.440
That got no applause.

54:29.440 --> 54:33.440
You whipped that out with such style.

54:33.440 --> 54:39.440
So this is a story of why I came here and what Harmontown means to me.

54:39.440 --> 54:45.440
I want to read part of it, but to set it up.

54:45.440 --> 54:46.440
Cool.

54:46.440 --> 54:47.440
For camera.

54:47.440 --> 54:48.440
It's better if you set it.

54:48.440 --> 54:49.440
No, I'm good.

54:49.440 --> 54:51.440
I kind of want to act out part of it.

54:51.440 --> 54:54.440
I was proud of my tie about a half hour ago.

54:54.440 --> 54:57.440
You've done fantastic.

54:57.440 --> 55:02.440
I'm going to like lavish you.

55:02.440 --> 55:06.440
I'll bring you down, but bring you back up in the end.

55:06.440 --> 55:11.440
This, so I was really depressed.

55:11.440 --> 55:16.440
Like this was only a couple of months ago, maybe two and a half or so.

55:16.440 --> 55:20.440
And yeah, I'd like, it was over the course of six months that it just got worse and worse.

55:20.440 --> 55:24.440
And then like I downward spiraled at the end there and I couldn't, I mean, I just didn't

55:24.440 --> 55:25.440
want to be awake.

55:25.440 --> 55:31.440
And I was listening to this podcast, like just waking up and listening to it just to,

55:31.440 --> 55:33.440
that was my lifeline.

55:33.440 --> 55:35.440
So that's the context.

55:35.440 --> 55:40.440
Well, actually, okay.

55:40.440 --> 55:46.440
And leading up to that, I named you Will Drosten.

55:46.440 --> 55:49.440
Is that okay?

55:49.440 --> 55:52.440
Will Drosten.

55:52.440 --> 56:01.440
To protect my identity.

56:01.440 --> 56:05.440
Or you're going from here to Doug Benson's podcast.

56:05.440 --> 56:10.440
I named you Will Drosten and he's like, that's great, I'm high.

56:10.440 --> 56:13.440
And then you're off to Joe Rogan and you're like, I named you Will Drosten and he's like,

56:13.440 --> 56:18.440
have you tried DMT?

56:18.440 --> 56:26.440
I found Will Drosten on Hey Ho Kool-Aid, which is also a made up name of a podcast that,

56:26.440 --> 56:35.440
okay, I had never heard of him before.

56:35.440 --> 56:36.440
Excuse me.

56:36.440 --> 56:40.440
I started the episode in the car after dropping my friend off on the opposite side of the city.

56:40.440 --> 56:45.440
I was fumbling with the controls while getting lost in a maze of basket woven overpasses and

56:45.440 --> 56:48.440
tunnels, trying to rewind.

56:48.440 --> 56:51.440
I had to concentrate to follow what he was saying.

56:51.440 --> 56:56.440
And it wasn't because he was intentionally obfuscating to trick his interlocutors into assuming he is

56:56.440 --> 56:58.440
intellectually superior.

56:58.440 --> 57:02.440
Lots of people would call him a creative genius, a term that gets bandied about,

57:02.440 --> 57:04.440
especially in Hollywood.

57:04.440 --> 57:08.440
Some people hate his guts, but I can't imagine that gets to him.

57:08.440 --> 57:13.440
He who describes himself as a fat, stupid piece of shit.

57:13.440 --> 57:23.440
Maybe he is.

57:23.440 --> 57:29.440
A nerd, an entertainer, a solipsist, a pariah, an exemplar of redemption, a pariah once

57:29.440 --> 57:35.440
more and once more redeemed, endlessly cycling along the curved quadrants of a four act narrative

57:35.440 --> 57:40.440
whose structure he believes is so deeply etched into our cognitive apparatuses, his tongue

57:40.440 --> 57:46.440
and cheek cameo on an episode of The Simpsons to pick him drawing the circle on a whiteboard.

57:46.440 --> 57:52.440
He doesn't claim to have discovered it, only to have successfully harnessed it to make a lot of money.

57:52.440 --> 58:00.440
His was a particularly delicious swirl of intricately web thoughts spun through articulatory prowess

58:00.440 --> 58:04.440
and above all an unabashed, unadulterated self-loathing.

58:04.440 --> 58:11.440
He didn't try to gloss over his twistedness, his fetishes, his alcohol and drug consumption, or ironically his shame.

58:11.440 --> 58:16.440
He knew where his faults lie and rather than deny them, he called them out in the loudest voice possible.

58:16.440 --> 58:20.440
It felt so good to watch someone do that. It was healing.

58:20.440 --> 58:26.440
I listened to that podcast like medicine, skating the razor's edge of self-righteousness and masochistic humility.

58:26.440 --> 58:31.440
I loved how they played on stage. I want friends to play with like that.

58:31.440 --> 58:37.440
I thought a drift in an ocean of empty beer cans and unwashed dishes.

58:37.440 --> 58:43.440
It's not done! It's not done!

58:43.440 --> 58:48.440
Chapter two.

58:48.440 --> 58:56.440
So, I had this dream where I met you

58:56.440 --> 59:02.440
and we were partners, not necessarily in a romantic way.

59:02.440 --> 59:05.440
Business partners. We don't get to play together.

59:05.440 --> 59:13.440
We were friends and at the end of our misadventures we end up on opposite sides of the street.

59:13.440 --> 59:18.440
We're like in our own houses on opposite sides of the street and we're talking on the landline

59:18.440 --> 59:23.440
and you've got a bunch of creatures and characters in the room with you and I'm alone over here

59:23.440 --> 59:29.440
but we're laughing and joking and I look out the window and notice that you've left your suitcase

59:29.440 --> 59:36.440
on the front porch with the door wide open and so I tried to like weave that into our banter

59:36.440 --> 59:42.440
but it didn't track so I said I'm going to come over and tell you a secret and you were like oh my god

59:42.440 --> 59:48.440
and so you came outside and you were kind of surprised when I just walked past you

59:48.440 --> 59:53.440
maybe like ruffled your hair, put the suitcase inside, closed the door

59:53.440 --> 59:59.440
and I walked back over to you and...

59:59.440 --> 01:00:04.440
Chapter three.

01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:12.440
I kissed the top of your head and at that moment I am instantly and utterly overwhelmed

01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:19.440
by the most intense feelings of gratitude, compassion, love and its myriad forms, the entire fucking universe.

01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:25.440
Boom! A bolt of lightning cracks and I wake up.

01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:31.440
There's a thunderstorm passing outside, tears stream down my face as I blissfully bathe

01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:36.440
and the sensory ups and salts of having been seen, been held and understood.

01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:42.440
I lie there for a few moments, the bath bubbles are popping, the tub water is draining.

01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:48.440
I move to get up but something gently urges, just enjoy these moments, they will be over soon enough.

01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:58.440
I sit on the edge of my bed, open the door and listen to the rain, still awash with the feeling of having spent intimate time with someone whom I adore and admire

01:00:58.440 --> 01:01:02.440
but we're strangers, right? What was that bolt of lightning?

01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:06.440
What about the rising sun streaming perfectly through that embrasure?

01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:10.440
What about that repeated topic of conversation? What about that stranger?

01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:15.440
Why are you connecting dots if there is no benevolent force assigning them ordered numbers?

01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:22.440
How can these be assembled to form a picture in a universe that doesn't deign to move you in any particular direction?

01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:31.440
What hit next collided with another bolt of lightning that cracked so loud and near my window that I jumped up and turned around.

01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:38.440
Heart pounding, half expecting someone to walk through the door.

01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:45.440
The benevolent force is you.

01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:48.440
It's you, it's you, it's you, it's you.

01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:57.440
If you choose benevolence, you are the engine of the force field that is blasting through the architecture of your consciousness and all of its contents.

01:01:57.440 --> 01:02:02.440
You are God.

01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:07.440
Alright.

01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:11.440
Thank you, Ashlyn. Absolutely beautiful. Ashlyn, everybody.

01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:15.440
Yeah, that's incredible.

01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:18.440
Thank you so much.

01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:25.440
I mean, you don't, like, we started doing this podcast like you don't, like, remember Adam Goldberg?

01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:28.440
Yeah, sounds like he's here.

01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:31.440
If you say his name three times, he'll appear on stage.

01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:35.440
The first thing was like, do you, is this a safe place?

01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:41.440
And if it is, do you bully anybody? Do you shut anybody out?

01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:45.440
That was such gorgeous prose.

01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:54.440
And I could go on about how it should not be applied to me, but that's not what's important.

01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:58.440
The prose kind of included that. The o-rings were in place there.

01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:06.440
She was able to create an expression of like, oh, this rubber ring could connect to anybody, really.

01:03:06.440 --> 01:03:11.440
That's so flattering, so beautiful.

01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:18.440
What blows my mind is that people, for some reason, are like, how long, seven years we've been doing this?

01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:27.440
No, I think, God, it's a million. And paste.commagazine.org.edu.

01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:35.440
Somebody said we're one of the top ten podcasts of the decade, which I didn't realize was like, we're nearing the end of a decade.

01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:38.440
Top 30.

01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:40.440
Top 30.

01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:43.440
Yeah, I was gonna say.

01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:45.440
I wish. Don't get me wrong.

01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:48.440
We were number 21 out of 30, I think.

01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:50.440
Alright, fine.

01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:54.440
I guess somebody polished that knob for me.

01:03:54.440 --> 01:03:56.440
We might have been in the top ten.

01:03:56.440 --> 01:03:58.440
I thought it was one of the top ten.

01:03:58.440 --> 01:04:10.440
Over the last couple of days, people have been coming, strange pilgrimage to the drawing room to say hi and go to the show and meet up with other Harmontown fans.

01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:15.440
It's really crazy. You guys came from everywhere. It's amazing.

01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:20.440
Has anybody not been to Los Angeles before tonight?

01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:22.440
Most of them.

01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:23.440
That's awesome.

01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:28.440
I met Sarah and Austin. You guys are from Chicago.

01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:31.440
My dad went there for school.

01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:36.440
There's Jennifer from Pennsylvania.

01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:38.440
Samson and Riley from where?

01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:41.440
Okay, well, what's your name from Vancouver?

01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:44.440
What's your name, buddy, from Vancouver?

01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:45.440
Samson and Riley.

01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:47.440
Danny from Vancouver.

01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:49.440
Oh, shit.

01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:52.440
Because I met him at the drawing room and he...

01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:54.440
Bring it up.

01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:56.440
Where's he at?

01:04:56.440 --> 01:05:01.440
What he said, Danny from Vancouver...

01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:02.440
Danny.

01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:08.440
I put a lot of pressure on you, but what you said was you've been working on a Dan Harmon.impression.

01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:11.440
Oh, yeah.

01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:19.440
That was one word long and you had it about 30% of the way.

01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:21.440
I was like, all right, come up and share it.

01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:24.440
Yeah, it's a sound and a word.

01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:27.440
Sorry to expand upon, but I promised you.

01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:29.440
This is a bait and switch.

01:05:29.440 --> 01:05:31.440
I feel comfortable.

01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:36.440
As we near the end of me being a public figure, I'm like, honestly,

01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:43.440
I would have loved to have seen a lot more impressions of me from the James Adomians of the world.

01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:47.440
I've solicited it, so whatever you can give me, I love it.

01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:48.440
Yeah, I tried.

01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:51.440
My friend Samson put me onto your podcast about nine months ago.

01:05:51.440 --> 01:06:00.440
I started binge listening and there was just one word that I picked up on that I thought quintessentialized Dan Harmon

01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:03.440
and maybe I could possibly imitate you on.

01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:05.440
So I need Jeff's help.

01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:13.440
I just need you to end sort of a non sequitur, an irritating story that Dan would find.

01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:20.440
Just something that, you know, whether you mean fucking or just anything sort of like end of a story.

01:06:20.440 --> 01:06:21.440
And then I'll, yeah.

01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:27.440
And the major D turned to me and said, thank you.

01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:39.440
All right.

01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:43.440
Danny from Vancouver.

01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:51.440
Danny everybody.

01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:53.440
You better get out of here, Danny.

01:06:53.440 --> 01:07:03.440
All right, thank you. Give it up for Danny everybody.

01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:07.440
He made Rob go crazy.

01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:09.440
Do you know what I realized tonight?

01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:15.440
Rob Schrab is the Rudy Giuliani of the Harmontown administration.

01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:16.440
That's exactly what he is.

01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:17.440
It's like friend or foe.

01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:18.440
We don't know.

01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:26.440
It's like if you watch like Seth Meyers impression of Rudy Giuliani, it's like, yeah.

01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:29.440
Oh, you don't like that?

01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:31.440
Neither would Rudy.

01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:34.440
Fuck it. Who else came from way far away?

01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:35.440
It's your birthday.

01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:36.440
What's your name, sir?

01:07:36.440 --> 01:07:37.440
Josh.

01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:38.440
Josh, where are you from?

01:07:38.440 --> 01:07:39.440
San Antonio.

01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:40.440
San Antonio.

01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:41.440
Bring it up, Josh.

01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:42.440
Happy birthday.

01:07:42.440 --> 01:07:49.440
You guys okay?

01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:54.440
Josh, when you get up here, Steve Supper's going to diagnose you on the spectrum.

01:07:54.440 --> 01:07:58.440
Where are we at, Steve, so far on the neurodiversity?

01:07:58.440 --> 01:08:04.440
It's 9-11.

01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:06.440
What up, Josh? Happy birthday.

01:08:06.440 --> 01:08:07.440
How old are you today?

01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:09.440
I'll be 37 on Thanksgiving.

01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:11.440
That's not your fucking birthday then, Josh.

01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:12.440
I lied to you.

01:08:12.440 --> 01:08:13.440
I'm sorry.

01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:15.440
Oh, come on.

01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:18.440
Hey, how many of y'all got booed on stage today?

01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:19.440
Lies.

01:08:19.440 --> 01:08:21.440
I made Dan Harmon laugh.

01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:22.440
Alright, shit.

01:08:22.440 --> 01:08:24.440
Okay, Josh, you're from San Antonio.

01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:25.440
I am.

01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:27.440
I'm going to be there in a few days.

01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:28.440
What's that bar?

01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:31.440
They used to be an old billiard hall where they have fuck-off devil's eggs.

01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:33.440
It's got like a neon sign out front.

01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:34.440
I don't know.

01:08:34.440 --> 01:08:35.440
I'll take you somewhere better.

01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:36.440
Okay.

01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:39.440
Wow, you've lied to me once already, Josh.

01:08:39.440 --> 01:08:44.440
Alright, well, in the show's defense, you did say,

01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:45.440
who's from somewhere else?

01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:48.440
And he was like, San Antonio, you're like, come up here.

01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:49.440
Right.

01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:53.440
So, like, I'm on his side if anyone's like, boo,

01:08:53.440 --> 01:08:55.440
because he didn't ask for this.

01:08:55.440 --> 01:08:56.440
They didn't ask for it.

01:08:56.440 --> 01:08:58.440
He yelled out, it's my birthday.

01:08:58.440 --> 01:08:59.440
I did.

01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:00.440
I totally voted for this.

01:09:00.440 --> 01:09:01.440
Alright, so it's not, and it's not.

01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:02.440
That's not.

01:09:02.440 --> 01:09:07.440
But, right, now, let's get to work.

01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:12.440
You think you're, you think maybe you're autistic or,

01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:17.440
did you write a beautiful letter about like the fucking nature of my soul?

01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:21.440
Where's your fucking kimono first off?

01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:23.440
I could recite some poetry.

01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:27.440
The community is like hands down my favorite show on behalf of everyone who loves it.

01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:31.440
Thank you very much for making that.

01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:34.440
I've seen it about 500 times from beginning to end,

01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:36.440
and I think that has something to do with autism.

01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:39.440
I know they're finding comfort in the repetition.

01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:43.440
And it, you know, as someone who also doesn't have a whole lot of friends,

01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:46.440
like this show does, it gives you that sense of community.

01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:49.440
I think it's one of Maslow's hierarchy of, you know,

01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:51.440
self-realization that you...

01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:53.440
Continue.

01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:54.440
Yeah, you...

01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:59.440
Well, Maslow had nine other hierarchies that are less publicized,

01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:01.440
and for good reason.

01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:05.440
Maslow's hierarchy of crushing posts.

01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:09.440
Which was a best-selling book.

01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:11.440
It was like, there were like nine...

01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:14.440
He had a hierarchy of surfing.

01:10:14.440 --> 01:10:20.440
A hierarchy of a red cabbage diet.

01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:21.440
Alright, sorry.

01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:22.440
I can't riff.

01:10:22.440 --> 01:10:24.440
Go to the carpet again.

01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:26.440
A sense of community.

01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:28.440
Maslow's hierarchy of carpet.

01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:29.440
Alright, sorry.

01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:30.440
Continue, please.

01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:32.440
Draw a fire.

01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:34.440
I had a question about community.

01:10:34.440 --> 01:10:37.440
Can Chang Astral project?

01:10:37.440 --> 01:10:42.440
There's an episode where they all go out to...

01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:46.440
And, you know, Brita wants to spray paint the billboard or whatever,

01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:48.440
and she's hanging out with Mike L.

01:10:48.440 --> 01:10:50.440
And then Chang is like running through the theater,

01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:53.440
but no one acknowledges him whatsoever.

01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:56.440
And then there's another time at the table where...

01:10:56.440 --> 01:10:58.440
Just like no one acknowledges him, and I'm like,

01:10:58.440 --> 01:10:59.440
is he really there?

01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:01.440
Is he Abe's imaginary friend?

01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:04.440
The idea was that he might...

01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:06.440
He himself might be a ghost.

01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:09.440
Or he might have been interacting with ghosts all night.

01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:12.440
Well, I would imagine if you could ask for a project that you could...

01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:13.440
That's your ghost.

01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:14.440
Right.

01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:15.440
You're asked for a project and he's a ghost.

01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:16.440
Yeah, and I...

01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:17.440
Like, thank you.

01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:18.440
I loved that episode.

01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:19.440
And I...

01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:21.440
God, like, that episode...

01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:23.440
How about John Oliver as a dramatic actor?

01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:24.440
Yeah.

01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:25.440
Oh.

01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:27.440
Let me ask you a question.

01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:29.440
Not to fire back in your face.

01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:33.440
But in this weird time of community being shopped around

01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:36.440
as a streaming thing,

01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:41.440
if maybe something on the table were like,

01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:47.440
oh, we'd pay more if you did more episodes

01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:49.440
or if you did a movie or whatever.

01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:51.440
I wrote a script for it if you wanted.

01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:52.440
I'll email it to you.

01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:55.440
That's not where I was going, but...

01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:59.440
As a consumer, which is what you are...

01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:00.440
Indeed.

01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:03.440
Don't lose sight!

01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:05.440
Uh...

01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:06.440
What's that?

01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:07.440
Would you...

01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:08.440
Like, would you...

01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:09.440
Do you want to...

01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:14.440
Like, would you want to see a community movie?

01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:15.440
Absolutely.

01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:16.440
One yes.

01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:17.440
Stop!

01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:18.440
Yes!

01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:20.440
That's an easy yes.

01:12:20.440 --> 01:12:23.440
Who wants free ice cream?

01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:27.440
I was like, would you want to see a community movie

01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:32.440
that was A, like, do you want to see everybody like...

01:12:32.440 --> 01:12:34.440
I mean, what does that entail?

01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:37.440
Like, I only want to ask you because, like, you know,

01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:39.440
even though, like, I just want to complain about this

01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:41.440
for a second while I'm drunk.

01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:43.440
For a second.

01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:45.440
If I was Parks and Rec, it would just be like,

01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:49.440
oh, should I sell to Netflix or Peacock?

01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:51.440
No, it's a community, so it's like,

01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:53.440
well, are you going to make a movie or not?

01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:55.440
I'm sure Netflix would buy it and, like, have a heartbeat.

01:12:55.440 --> 01:12:59.440
Yeah, I'm sure they'd buy a lot of fucking Netflix.

01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:01.440
Fucking Walmart of TV.

01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:02.440
Fuck!

01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:04.440
You could do it as an animation.

01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:06.440
Bojack Horseman's canceled,

01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:08.440
but everyone was watching it.

01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:09.440
Like, I'm sorry.

01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:10.440
I'm sorry.

01:13:10.440 --> 01:13:11.440
All right.

01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:12.440
Okay.

01:13:12.440 --> 01:13:13.440
Thank you, Josh.

01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:14.440
Welcome.

01:13:14.440 --> 01:13:15.440
It was good enough for Josh, everybody.

01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:16.440
Thank you, brother.

01:13:16.440 --> 01:13:17.440
All right, all right.

01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:18.440
Are you friends with Riley in San Francisco?

01:13:18.440 --> 01:13:20.440
Let's get out of the television business.

01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:22.440
Nobody heard that.

01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:27.440
Steve, look, you're a deadhead.

01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:28.440
Yes.

01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:29.440
You worked with Alan Ginsberg.

01:13:29.440 --> 01:13:30.440
I did.

01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:34.440
You're a gay, married journalist.

01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:35.440
You work with Ginsburg?

01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:36.440
I was his teaching assistant.

01:13:36.440 --> 01:13:37.440
What the hell?

01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:39.440
Yeah, when I was a teenager.

01:13:39.440 --> 01:13:41.440
That's why I love him.

01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:43.440
Well, that's fucked up.

01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:44.440
Starfucker.

01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:46.440
You fucking starfucker.

01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:48.440
We knew it.

01:13:48.440 --> 01:13:50.440
You got me here tonight.

01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:51.440
Exactly.

01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:53.440
What other qualifications do I have?

01:13:53.440 --> 01:13:54.440
You're a chemistry teacher.

01:13:54.440 --> 01:13:58.440
You're like, hey, potassium plus fluoride equals potassium fluoride.

01:13:58.440 --> 01:14:00.440
I don't think that's how it works.

01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:01.440
Okay.

01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:02.440
All right.

01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:09.440
Look, Steve, what's your favorite hydrocarbon?

01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:10.440
Top five.

01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:12.440
Top five hydrocarbons.

01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:13.440
Methane.

01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:14.440
Methane.

01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:15.440
Just go in order.

01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:16.440
Yeah, yeah.

01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:17.440
I got a soft spot for hexane.

01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:18.440
Oh, okay.

01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:19.440
Yeah.

01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:20.440
Oh, wow.

01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:21.440
That's a fucking hot take.

01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:22.440
That's a fucking, yeah.

01:14:22.440 --> 01:14:25.440
That's a sentence I never thought I would hear today.

01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:28.440
It's a sentence I've never said before.

01:14:28.440 --> 01:14:30.440
All right.

01:14:30.440 --> 01:14:32.440
Now, is hexane a hydrocarbon?

01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:33.440
Yeah.

01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:34.440
Great.

01:14:34.440 --> 01:14:38.440
It's like six aims.

01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:42.440
And I'm sure there's exothermic reactions involved there, right?

01:14:42.440 --> 01:14:44.440
Well, it's pretty flammable, yeah.

01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:45.440
Yeah.

01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:46.440
Yeah.

01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:54.280
Actually, it's a cool demo that you, the, the, it evaporates and the vapor is both heavier

01:14:54.280 --> 01:14:56.280
than air and super flammable.

01:14:56.280 --> 01:15:01.440
So you can pour it like down a ramp to a candle and then it burns up the whole ramp.

01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:02.440
Keith?

01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:03.440
That's a good one.

01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:04.440
For $5.

01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:05.440
Out of my own pocket.

01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:09.440
At what temperature is methane liquid?

01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:10.440
Oh.

01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:19.440
I literally just taught about the boiling points of hydrocarbons last week, and I don't know.

01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:21.440
You can look at the periodic table.

01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:22.440
Yeah.

01:15:22.440 --> 01:15:23.440
No.

01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:25.440
I it's it's cold.

01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:26.440
It's really cold.

01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:27.440
It's got to be real cold.

01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:28.440
It's got to be real.

01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:29.440
You got to be on one of them.

01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:31.440
It's got to be real cold.

01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:34.440
That's pretty much the level of expertise I bring to my classroom.

01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:35.440
Yeah.

01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:38.440
What's the boiling point of this real cold really cold?

01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:40.440
Are there like seas of it?

01:15:40.440 --> 01:15:44.440
Man, as far as I'm concerned, you're bulletproof because you tied a motherfucking bow tie without

01:15:44.440 --> 01:15:45.440
looking like that.

01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:46.440
You are now.

01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:48.440
And while being yelled at.

01:15:48.440 --> 01:15:50.440
You're, you're, you're my Superman.

01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:55.440
Is it, is it, is it, you know, if it's prying, whatever, because you have students, whatever.

01:15:55.440 --> 01:15:57.440
I, I, like, like, how did you guys meet?

01:15:57.440 --> 01:15:58.440
That's what I want to know.

01:15:58.440 --> 01:16:01.440
I want to hear the name of the group.

01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:02.440
We won't.

01:16:02.440 --> 01:16:03.440
Yeah.

01:16:03.440 --> 01:16:05.440
We met on the online before the web.

01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:06.440
Yeah.

01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:10.440
I had written an article for wired about gay and lesbian teenagers building community

01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:16.440
on America online and everybody said, yeah, American online sucks, but check out use net.

01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:21.440
So I went to use net and I had just spent a month and a half interviewing these little

01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:26.440
gay kids who were like saving each other from suicide and taking each other in when they

01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:28.440
ran away from their abusive parents and whatnot.

01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:35.440
And the first thing I see on use net was some bitchy queen saying, oh, these young gay kids

01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:37.440
these days, they're all airheads and twinks.

01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:41.440
They're squandering the freedoms we fought so hard for at Stonewall.

01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:42.440
Okay.

01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:44.440
And it was not me.

01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:45.440
No, it was not you.

01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:46.440
It was not me.

01:16:46.440 --> 01:16:47.440
It is roommate.

01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:48.440
Yeah.

01:16:48.440 --> 01:16:49.440
No.

01:16:49.440 --> 01:16:52.440
And so, so I wrote back and I said, no, actually, they're amazing.

01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:56.440
And you know, I have this article and wired magazine, blah, blah, blah.

01:16:56.440 --> 01:17:01.440
Keith wrote me the next day and said, are you the same Steve Silverman who reviews Grateful

01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:04.440
Dead shows for this online community called the will.

01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:06.440
That's the connection is the dead.

01:17:06.440 --> 01:17:07.440
It's true.

01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:11.440
And he, and he, and he said gay dead heads are rare, which was true.

01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:14.440
And so I walked into a gay dead heads are rare.

01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:16.440
Yeah, they, they, they are.

01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:18.440
They're more common now, but yeah.

01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:21.440
I mentioned, well, anything dead head is rare, like black dead heads are rare.

01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:22.440
Yeah.

01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:23.440
Women dead heads are rare.

01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:24.440
Yes.

01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:25.440
There's only a lot of women.

01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:26.440
Okay.

01:17:26.440 --> 01:17:27.440
Well, they're half the plan.

01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:28.440
There are zero gay parent heads.

01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:30.440
There's only there are no gay parents.

01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:32.440
Anyway, we have better tastes than that.

01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:34.440
Okay.

01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:39.440
So after I talked to Keith on the phone a couple of times, I went to meet him at a brew pub

01:17:39.440 --> 01:17:45.440
in Berkeley and I walked in, we had not talked about our ages or our appearance.

01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:48.440
And so I am 12 years older than Keith.

01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:50.440
Oh, that's so gross.

01:17:50.440 --> 01:17:51.440
I know it's gross.

01:17:51.440 --> 01:17:53.440
I'm 12 years older than Cody.

01:17:53.440 --> 01:17:59.440
So, so in any case, I walked into the brew pub and there was this fucking gorgeous guy

01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:02.440
and I thought to myself, oh, this is going to be a nightmare for him.

01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:07.440
He's going to think like I'm some old troll from the internet, but actually he liked me

01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:10.440
and we liked each other and we've been together for 25 years.

01:18:10.440 --> 01:18:11.440
Wow.

01:18:11.440 --> 01:18:21.440
And about a month, about a month and a half after we met, we were on fish tour together.

01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:22.440
We were.

01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:23.440
Okay.

01:18:23.440 --> 01:18:25.440
We went to show in Chico actually.

01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:28.440
The only time I've been to Chico, I saw fish play in the gym.

01:18:28.440 --> 01:18:29.440
Matthews.

01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:30.440
No, no, no.

01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:33.440
God, no, we haven't had a taste of that.

01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:34.440
Steve's not here.

01:18:34.440 --> 01:18:36.440
Can I ask you both?

01:18:36.440 --> 01:18:39.440
So you're both dead heads and fish, fish, fish food?

01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:40.440
What do you call fish lovers?

01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:41.440
Fans.

01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:42.440
Fans with a pH.

01:18:42.440 --> 01:18:43.440
What?

01:18:43.440 --> 01:18:44.440
Fins.

01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:45.440
Fins.

01:18:45.440 --> 01:18:46.440
Fanatics.

01:18:46.440 --> 01:18:48.440
Fanatics, they call them.

01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:50.440
And I'm not talking shit.

01:18:50.440 --> 01:18:54.440
What is the appeal of dead head, like Grateful Dad and fish?

01:18:54.440 --> 01:18:57.440
Because I listened to it and I don't really get it.

01:18:57.440 --> 01:18:58.440
Yeah.

01:18:58.440 --> 01:18:59.440
It's improvised.

01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:04.440
You know, jazz style improvisation applied to rock and roll music, basically.

01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:09.440
So if you, you know, if you think, if you hear jazz and you think boring, you probably

01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:11.440
won't like the dead or fish.

01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:12.440
Right.

01:19:12.440 --> 01:19:13.440
Right.

01:19:13.440 --> 01:19:14.440
It's because you're watching transparency on stage.

01:19:14.440 --> 01:19:15.440
Right.

01:19:15.440 --> 01:19:16.440
They're doing something.

01:19:16.440 --> 01:19:18.440
They're going like, Hey, let me try this.

01:19:18.440 --> 01:19:19.440
Boom, boom, boom.

01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:20.440
Right.

01:19:20.440 --> 01:19:23.440
And then like, Oh, is it really all improv or are they doing like, they have, they have

01:19:23.440 --> 01:19:24.440
obviously songs.

01:19:24.440 --> 01:19:29.440
But they improvise segues and they, a lot of, they'll just do like, they'll just, they'll

01:19:29.440 --> 01:19:30.440
just riff for a while.

01:19:30.440 --> 01:19:35.040
So we, no, it's not just, that's such an important distinction.

01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:36.200
It's not just riffing.

01:19:36.200 --> 01:19:40.640
It's more like narrative storytelling without words, basically using.

01:19:40.640 --> 01:19:41.640
But improvisationally.

01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:42.640
Yeah.

01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:43.640
Yes.

01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:44.640
Okay.

01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:45.640
Wow.

01:19:45.640 --> 01:19:46.640
And it's, it's a fish for me.

01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:51.540
The, the, uh, what I love about their improvisations and their style is that they build these sort

01:19:51.540 --> 01:19:58.640
of repetitive, um, and yet subtly, slowly changing sort of patterns.

01:19:58.640 --> 01:20:00.520
And I swear it's just like how my brain works.

01:20:00.520 --> 01:20:03.160
Like I do, I do great thinking at fish shows.

01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:04.160
Really?

01:20:04.160 --> 01:20:05.160
Yeah.

01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:07.760
Like they'll, that's actually a big thing for both dead and fish is that it gives one

01:20:07.760 --> 01:20:12.160
a chance to be alone with oneself in a really beautiful way in a crowd of people.

01:20:12.160 --> 01:20:13.160
Yeah.

01:20:13.160 --> 01:20:14.160
I love being alone around people.

01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:15.640
That's one of my favorite things.

01:20:15.640 --> 01:20:20.640
Our friend Harris Wittels was a big fish guy, had a whole podcast about like, come

01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:23.040
at me about fish.

01:20:23.040 --> 01:20:24.040
And that was his whole thing.

01:20:24.040 --> 01:20:27.280
It was like, he would write on parks and rec and was like a valued employee.

01:20:27.280 --> 01:20:31.160
And then he'd go to fish concerts and he was like, that's, I'd never heard it described

01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:36.360
that way though, that it's a way to actually, it allows you to keep people at a distance.

01:20:36.360 --> 01:20:41.920
Now that Jerry has gone, uh, do you still go, did they still have dead shows?

01:20:41.920 --> 01:20:42.920
They do.

01:20:42.920 --> 01:20:43.920
The Dead and Company with John.

01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:44.920
Do you still go to them?

01:20:44.920 --> 01:20:45.920
Not so much.

01:20:45.920 --> 01:20:47.920
Jerry, Jerry was a big piece of it.

01:20:47.920 --> 01:20:48.920
Jerry was a genius.

01:20:48.920 --> 01:20:54.000
But fish, like, let's say I, who don't know anything about any of this, if I went to like

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:58.160
just walking cold to a fish show, what do you think my neuro-tropical-

01:20:58.160 --> 01:20:59.640
You might think it was really boring.

01:20:59.640 --> 01:21:00.640
Yeah.

01:21:00.640 --> 01:21:02.640
Um, and you might think the lyrics were nonsense.

01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:06.520
And you'd think that most of the fans are robotic cult members.

01:21:06.520 --> 01:21:09.320
Well, like, say things in unison.

01:21:09.320 --> 01:21:15.920
I was in like a dive bar in Orlando, Florida, and a giant group of people came in and there

01:21:15.920 --> 01:21:22.360
was a Jimmy Buffett show had just broken up and a bunch of, you know, 50-year-old, 50-something,

01:21:22.360 --> 01:21:27.560
60-somethings, parrot heads came in and there was the nicest, happiest fans I've ever met

01:21:27.560 --> 01:21:28.560
in my life.

01:21:28.560 --> 01:21:29.560
That's great.

01:21:29.560 --> 01:21:31.800
And so like, like, there must be something going on because when I hear Jimmy Buffett,

01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:33.400
I want to take my own life.

01:21:33.400 --> 01:21:34.400
No, I know.

01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:35.400
Exactly.

01:21:35.400 --> 01:21:36.400
Yeah.

01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:37.400
Yeah.

01:21:37.400 --> 01:21:38.400
Absolutely.

01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:39.400
Well, you know, I'll tell you something.

01:21:39.400 --> 01:21:43.400
Actually, there is, believe it or not, a Dan Harmon Grateful Dead connection, which is

01:21:43.400 --> 01:21:44.400
that.

01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:45.400
I'm in.

01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:46.400
Yeah.

01:21:46.400 --> 01:21:50.360
Which is that one of the things that we've been hearing about all night tonight is misfit

01:21:50.360 --> 01:21:51.360
power.

01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:55.440
That's how Bob Weir said it about the Grateful Dead.

01:21:55.440 --> 01:21:59.680
That's what drew people to the Grateful Dead because no, they were not cute.

01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:01.120
No, they were not stylish.

01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:05.560
No, it didn't matter if they were, you know, had a hit record or not.

01:22:05.560 --> 01:22:10.800
People would be self-selecting into the community of deadheads.

01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:14.200
And just because you love the music and you like the people and you love to have a good

01:22:14.200 --> 01:22:19.240
time around these people, but not a good time like those other people have, but this good

01:22:19.240 --> 01:22:20.400
time.

01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:25.680
And I think community has self-selected in the same way for people who haven't felt

01:22:25.680 --> 01:22:29.920
at home in other places in the world, but really feel at home here.

01:22:29.920 --> 01:22:30.920
Yeah.

01:22:30.920 --> 01:22:32.920
We're like juggalos.

01:22:32.920 --> 01:22:33.920
All right.

01:22:33.920 --> 01:22:34.920
Who?

01:22:34.920 --> 01:22:39.920
How do you guys feel about Rush?

01:22:39.920 --> 01:22:40.920
Not.

01:22:40.920 --> 01:22:46.200
Don't ask us about every damn rock rush.

01:22:46.200 --> 01:22:50.480
Okay, lightning bonus round, name bands.

01:22:50.480 --> 01:22:55.000
When I listened to Phil Collins, nobody has the relationship with Phil Collins that I

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:56.000
have.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:02.280
I had a roommate once who had the same relationship with Phil Collins that I had.

01:23:02.280 --> 01:23:06.040
And we would go like, yeah, she seems to have an invisible touch.

01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:08.160
And we were like, we were into it.

01:23:08.160 --> 01:23:14.960
It was, it did, Phil Collins wasn't doing anything wrong and we were doing something

01:23:14.960 --> 01:23:15.960
right.

01:23:15.960 --> 01:23:16.960
Yes, he was.

01:23:16.960 --> 01:23:17.960
He was.

01:23:17.960 --> 01:23:18.960
You dicks.

01:23:18.960 --> 01:23:19.960
Phil Collins.

01:23:19.960 --> 01:23:20.960
That's the thing.

01:23:20.960 --> 01:23:24.760
Like correct me if I'm wrong, not to high road him, but go ahead and fucking high road

01:23:24.760 --> 01:23:25.840
him.

01:23:25.840 --> 01:23:29.840
Like that's the shit you're escaping when you become a deadhead or a fish band.

01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:34.400
It's like you're escaping the fucking snobbery, right?

01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:42.280
No, you're escaping the banality like you're just like, you know what?

01:23:42.280 --> 01:23:46.080
I don't know anything about fucking why this is good or bad music, but I'm just going to

01:23:46.080 --> 01:23:47.080
hang out.

01:23:47.080 --> 01:23:48.080
Yeah.

01:23:48.080 --> 01:23:53.960
I mean, Phil Collins, you know, he's not my favorite, but when you when you sing, it's

01:23:53.960 --> 01:23:54.960
who was there.

01:23:54.960 --> 01:23:55.960
It's my eggshell.

01:23:55.960 --> 01:24:00.600
What eggshell did you eat when you were fucking going from an embryo to a chicken?

01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:03.120
I love Neil Diamond way too much.

01:24:03.120 --> 01:24:06.600
People have a like love hate and I would never take that away from you.

01:24:06.600 --> 01:24:10.640
No, because I'm a good friend.

01:24:10.640 --> 01:24:11.640
Phil Collins.

01:24:11.640 --> 01:24:15.160
I mean, Neil Diamond.

01:24:15.160 --> 01:24:16.160
Come on.

01:24:16.160 --> 01:24:17.280
There's not even a fucking contest there.

01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:18.780
Oh, there is.

01:24:18.780 --> 01:24:19.780
But who?

01:24:19.780 --> 01:24:20.780
Who?

01:24:20.780 --> 01:24:21.780
He was a Jew.

01:24:21.780 --> 01:24:22.780
He was a Jew.

01:24:22.780 --> 01:24:23.780
He was a Jew.

01:24:23.780 --> 01:24:24.780
He was a Jew.

01:24:24.780 --> 01:24:26.960
He was a Jew who sang gospel music.

01:24:26.960 --> 01:24:27.960
Oh my God.

01:24:27.960 --> 01:24:33.000
Phil Collins is a drummer in a band that should never have existed.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:34.000
I agree.

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:35.000
I agree.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:36.000
He's the fucking drummer.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:37.000
We agree on that.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:38.000
Master.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:39.000
We agree on that.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:42.360
The next you're going to say you love Sting and the police like fucking booze.

01:24:42.360 --> 01:24:43.360
I don't.

01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:44.360
Sting's great.

01:24:44.360 --> 01:24:45.360
I love the police.

01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:46.760
Fuck all of you people.

01:24:46.760 --> 01:24:49.280
Also outcast, fun to listen to.

01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:51.040
I don't understand you people.

01:24:51.040 --> 01:24:52.040
I don't get it.

01:24:52.040 --> 01:24:54.720
Hey, y'all, like it's a good song.

01:24:54.720 --> 01:24:55.720
It's a toe tapper.

01:24:55.720 --> 01:24:56.720
I don't get it.

01:24:56.720 --> 01:25:00.640
I like, like, like, like the music snobbery.

01:25:00.640 --> 01:25:06.080

01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:18.000
not going to mention this because I don't want to be made fun of.

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:22.760
Well, I like I'm go boingo.

01:25:22.760 --> 01:25:26.040
Do you like and yeah, yeah, I do like in you.

01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:27.040
That's the way.

01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:28.040
Yeah.

01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:30.880
It's fucking good way.

01:25:30.880 --> 01:25:31.880
Steve Steve.

01:25:31.880 --> 01:25:32.880
What is it?

01:25:32.880 --> 01:25:33.880
So you're a deadhead.

01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:35.240
You're you're you're super hip.

01:25:35.240 --> 01:25:41.240
You get your Ginsburg San Francisco married gay journalist credits.

01:25:41.240 --> 01:25:47.400
Now tell us who's the fucking like what's the what's the what's the what's the Spotify

01:25:47.400 --> 01:25:51.120
thing you click that you're embarrassed about.

01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:55.720
I well, especially on this stage, it says you're going to ruin that.

01:25:55.720 --> 01:25:56.720
I think the tight.

01:25:56.720 --> 01:25:57.720
All right.

01:25:57.720 --> 01:26:01.560
Is that the rocks candy?

01:26:01.560 --> 01:26:07.720
We all there's too many things happening at once here.

01:26:07.720 --> 01:26:19.320
Rob, we do in favor and also it's only for for visual.

01:26:19.320 --> 01:26:21.160
I was talking about Billy Zane earlier.

01:26:21.160 --> 01:26:22.840
Will you just do take your glasses off?

01:26:22.840 --> 01:26:27.680
I'm not going to just give me your old give me your non your nonverbal your nonverbal

01:26:27.680 --> 01:26:32.440
your nonverbal just just facial Billy Zane.

01:26:32.440 --> 01:26:34.320
Don't tell me I don't have to do it.

01:26:34.320 --> 01:26:35.320
Did you see sticks?

01:26:35.320 --> 01:26:36.320
Is that what you're saying?

01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:37.320
No, Sting.

01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:38.320
Sorry.

01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:39.320
Sting.

01:26:39.320 --> 01:26:40.320
Yeah.

01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:41.320
Sting's voice.

01:26:41.320 --> 01:26:42.320
Give me a break.

01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:43.320
Yeah.

01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:45.520
Are we going to pretend there's nothing remarkable about Sting's voice again?

01:26:45.520 --> 01:26:46.520
Oh yeah.

01:26:46.520 --> 01:26:49.920
Let's all go to our graves in denial, right?

01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:52.120
That's ridiculous.

01:26:52.120 --> 01:26:57.520
Police and I almost said retarded, but I changed it to ridiculous because Sting taught

01:26:57.520 --> 01:26:58.520
me patience.

01:26:58.520 --> 01:26:59.520
Just do a little.

01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:01.080
I'll just give me one second.

01:27:01.080 --> 01:27:03.240
He's pimping me and I don't want to.

01:27:03.240 --> 01:27:04.240
What?

01:27:04.240 --> 01:27:05.240
What?

01:27:05.240 --> 01:27:06.240
You don't want to do Billy Zane?

01:27:06.240 --> 01:27:07.240
Don't do it.

01:27:07.240 --> 01:27:08.240
I mean, you put me on the spot.

01:27:08.240 --> 01:27:09.240
I don't want to.

01:27:09.240 --> 01:27:10.240
I had the time.

01:27:10.240 --> 01:27:11.240
Oh.

01:27:11.240 --> 01:27:12.240
It's good.

01:27:12.240 --> 01:27:13.240
Come on.

01:27:13.240 --> 01:27:14.240
Just do your fucking.

01:27:14.240 --> 01:27:15.240
All right.

01:27:15.240 --> 01:27:16.240
Wait.

01:27:16.240 --> 01:27:17.240
Wait.

01:27:17.240 --> 01:27:18.240
Schrab.

01:27:18.240 --> 01:27:19.240
Wait.

01:27:19.240 --> 01:27:20.240
You were a shit to me last week in the writer's room.

01:27:20.240 --> 01:27:21.240
Talk of dish.

01:27:21.240 --> 01:27:22.240
Dish.

01:27:22.240 --> 01:27:23.240
Dish.

01:27:23.240 --> 01:27:24.240
Whoa.

01:27:24.240 --> 01:27:25.240
Dish.

01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:26.240
You did a great job.

01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:29.720
I just want to beat the living hell out of you right now.

01:27:29.720 --> 01:27:30.720
Oh my God.

01:27:30.720 --> 01:27:32.240
You were being such a dick the whole day.

01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:34.400
I was not a being a dick.

01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:35.400
I was not.

01:27:35.400 --> 01:27:37.400
I'm trying to help save your show.

01:27:37.400 --> 01:27:38.400
Oh my God.

01:27:38.400 --> 01:27:40.840
You wrote a great script and then you're just like the next week.

01:27:40.840 --> 01:27:41.840
You're just like.

01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:44.920
You're like an eight year old child of 46.

01:27:44.920 --> 01:27:46.920
Like, why are you going to act like that?

01:27:46.920 --> 01:27:50.920
I was just like, like, what did I do that deserves just sitting there.

01:27:50.920 --> 01:27:58.560
You're like, do your fucking billy thing, do your fucking billy thing.

01:27:58.560 --> 01:28:01.560
I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, oh, I'm just going to beat the living hell out of you.

01:28:01.560 --> 01:28:02.560
I meant that.

01:28:02.560 --> 01:28:03.760
You know, I know.

01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:04.760
I know.

01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:05.760
I know.

01:28:05.760 --> 01:28:06.760
I know.

01:28:06.760 --> 01:28:07.760
And you're not a violent guy.

01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:11.040
Because I wanted to beat you with a baseball bat.

01:28:11.040 --> 01:28:16.400
I told that to Kate, and I said, Dan said he wanted to beat me with a baseball bat.

01:28:16.400 --> 01:28:19.480
And you know what she said, if she's a good partner?

01:28:19.480 --> 01:28:20.920
What did you do?

01:28:20.920 --> 01:28:23.360
Yeah, she did.

01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:26.480
Because I was saying it like, I didn't want her to beat you.

01:28:26.480 --> 01:28:27.800
Because she knows you.

01:28:27.800 --> 01:28:29.480
Why are you smiling?

01:28:29.480 --> 01:28:30.880
And I'm like, because it was awesome.

01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:31.560
I did it.

01:28:31.560 --> 01:28:35.520
I got Dan to threaten to beat me with a baseball bat.

01:28:35.520 --> 01:28:38.720
And if Tate is the woman I know she is, she was like,

01:28:38.720 --> 01:28:40.360
what did you do?

01:28:40.360 --> 01:28:42.520
Yes.

01:28:42.520 --> 01:28:43.520
What did you do?

01:28:43.520 --> 01:28:44.020
Fuck it.

01:28:44.020 --> 01:28:44.920
What did you do?

01:28:44.920 --> 01:28:45.800
We hang in there.

01:28:45.800 --> 01:28:47.400
We have a gold mine in front of us.

01:28:47.400 --> 01:28:48.880
70 episodes.

01:28:48.880 --> 01:28:51.680
Everyone, keep your cool.

01:28:51.680 --> 01:28:53.360
Let's all just make a bunch of money.

01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:54.000
Right.

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:54.520
Yeah.

01:28:54.520 --> 01:28:55.760
What were we talking about?

01:28:55.760 --> 01:28:56.920
Billy Zane.

01:28:56.920 --> 01:28:57.440
Billy Zane.

01:28:57.440 --> 01:28:58.080
No, wait.

01:28:58.080 --> 01:28:58.800
OK.

01:28:58.800 --> 01:29:02.520
Do your Billy Zane or I'll give you this option.

01:29:02.520 --> 01:29:04.080
Because one of the best impressions

01:29:04.080 --> 01:29:06.000
I've ever seen Rob Schrab do.

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.640
We were in LA not that long.

01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:12.600
And Schrab was like, Schrab came to, Schrab said,

01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:20.560
I'm pretty sure I think Nicholas Cage drove by me

01:29:20.560 --> 01:29:22.560
on a motorcycle today.

01:29:22.560 --> 01:29:25.200
And this is like 20 years ago.

01:29:25.200 --> 01:29:27.560
And I was like, how do you know it was Nicholas Cage?

01:29:27.560 --> 01:29:31.360
He was like, well, he was wearing a helmet.

01:29:31.360 --> 01:29:34.720
And I was like, well, then how on earth

01:29:34.720 --> 01:29:36.240
would you know it was Nicholas Cage?

01:29:36.240 --> 01:29:41.280
And Schrab answered my question by holding a folder

01:29:41.280 --> 01:29:43.200
in front of his face.

01:29:43.200 --> 01:29:46.280
And with his eyes and eyebrows alone,

01:29:46.280 --> 01:29:49.600
convinced it going like, oh, that's Nicholas Cage.

01:29:49.600 --> 01:29:51.080
So.

01:29:51.080 --> 01:29:52.120
Nice.

01:29:52.120 --> 01:29:55.000
Nice.

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:55.500
Nice.

01:30:01.880 --> 01:30:05.960
For $5 a month, you can see what just happened.

01:30:05.960 --> 01:30:07.680
Go to Harmontown.com.

01:30:07.680 --> 01:30:08.600
They're like, why?

01:30:08.600 --> 01:30:10.320
Give me Rob, Rob, just for me.

01:30:10.320 --> 01:30:11.880
I don't want to fucking do it.

01:30:11.880 --> 01:30:13.280
Happy birthday.

01:30:13.280 --> 01:30:15.880
Give me a little fucking bit of a thing.

01:30:15.880 --> 01:30:19.320
I'm not a.

01:30:19.320 --> 01:30:21.160
I don't want to do it, all right?

01:30:21.160 --> 01:30:22.360
The room.

01:30:22.360 --> 01:30:24.040
You just said Nicholas Cage.

01:30:24.040 --> 01:30:25.080
That's fine.

01:30:25.080 --> 01:30:25.880
I gave him that out.

01:30:25.880 --> 01:30:26.400
He did that.

01:30:26.400 --> 01:30:26.880
That's fine.

01:30:26.880 --> 01:30:28.040
Give me it now.

01:30:28.040 --> 01:30:30.080
What did you do that made Dan so mad?

01:30:30.080 --> 01:30:32.440
Well, Dan said he wanted a.

01:30:32.440 --> 01:30:35.000
He was working on his panic room.

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:35.760
Sure.

01:30:35.760 --> 01:30:42.000
And then I said, you should have a panic at the disco room.

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:43.280
No, that's not.

01:30:43.280 --> 01:30:43.960
Well, that's.

01:30:43.960 --> 01:30:47.440
And then he said, I just want to take a bat.

01:30:47.440 --> 01:30:48.320
That's a great idea.

01:30:48.320 --> 01:30:50.720
And beat the hell out of you.

01:30:50.720 --> 01:30:52.360
I just want to beat.

01:30:52.360 --> 01:30:54.800
And he was like, and I mean it.

01:30:54.800 --> 01:30:56.040
That's not.

01:30:56.040 --> 01:30:57.480
Nothing about that is accurate.

01:30:57.480 --> 01:30:58.640
That is so true.

01:30:58.640 --> 01:30:59.240
That's not.

01:30:59.240 --> 01:31:01.040
Nothing about that is accurate.

01:31:01.040 --> 01:31:02.880
No, it's totally accurate.

01:31:02.880 --> 01:31:03.560
So, Dan.

01:31:03.560 --> 01:31:05.000
You wanted to beat the hell out of me.

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:06.480
About the fucking show.

01:31:06.480 --> 01:31:08.760
I'm trying to write Rick and Morty with you.

01:31:08.760 --> 01:31:09.240
Right.

01:31:09.240 --> 01:31:12.680
And I said, halfway through a rant, as I riff,

01:31:12.680 --> 01:31:15.360
I go like, oh, well, I don't know.

01:31:15.360 --> 01:31:16.840
Maybe it'd be like a thing like this,

01:31:16.840 --> 01:31:18.240
and I want to be like that.

01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:23.040
And I said, as I want to, I said, oh, well,

01:31:23.040 --> 01:31:25.520
that would be like a Christopher Durang thing.

01:31:25.520 --> 01:31:29.720
And it's like, in my mind, I was going like, well,

01:31:29.720 --> 01:31:32.920
maybe it's like so much metaphor that it's absurd.

01:31:32.920 --> 01:31:33.920
You hang a lantern on it.

01:31:33.920 --> 01:31:35.280
I don't even know what I was referencing.

01:31:35.280 --> 01:31:36.800
I'm not like a theater major.

01:31:36.800 --> 01:31:38.760
But I'm like, Christopher Durang.

01:31:38.760 --> 01:31:40.000
I throw it out.

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:41.400
I throw out a lot of things.

01:31:41.400 --> 01:31:42.400
I keep talking.

01:31:42.400 --> 01:31:45.320
I keep talking because I fucking try and I

01:31:45.320 --> 01:31:47.760
work to keep my show afloat.

01:31:47.760 --> 01:31:49.480
And this guy is sitting over there.

01:31:49.480 --> 01:31:50.520
And then it wasn't.

01:31:50.520 --> 01:31:52.200
It was like, he's sitting over there looking just

01:31:52.200 --> 01:31:53.160
like he is right now.

01:31:53.160 --> 01:31:59.840
And he's 50 years old.

01:31:59.840 --> 01:32:02.440
Don't let him fool you.

01:32:02.440 --> 01:32:04.280
He's 50.

01:32:04.280 --> 01:32:06.880
So there's no excuse for what I'm about to tell you.

01:32:06.880 --> 01:32:07.600
And I keep going.

01:32:07.600 --> 01:32:11.320
I'm like, well, what if Rick had this relationship with this?

01:32:11.320 --> 01:32:14.400
And we're like, the laser thing, and we don't want

01:32:14.400 --> 01:32:15.880
the cannon to be this.

01:32:15.880 --> 01:32:18.640
And there's finally silence because my fucking lungs

01:32:18.640 --> 01:32:19.200
collapse.

01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:23.520
And we're just like, silence.

01:32:23.520 --> 01:32:29.640
And then Schrab goes, oh, what would Christopher Durang do?

01:32:29.640 --> 01:32:32.280
And that's when I said, I want to fucking pound

01:32:32.280 --> 01:32:34.720
your face in.

01:32:34.720 --> 01:32:39.360
Because you knew what you were doing.

01:32:39.360 --> 01:32:43.760
Because all you do is sit there and I fucking talk.

01:32:43.760 --> 01:32:46.320
And I'm going to fucking talk.

01:32:46.320 --> 01:32:48.320
And then you're like, Christopher Durang.

01:32:48.320 --> 01:32:50.800
I'm like, fuck you, fuck you.

01:32:50.800 --> 01:32:53.000
You know I was mad at you.

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:54.080
I was mad at you.

01:32:54.080 --> 01:32:55.080
Yeah.

01:32:55.080 --> 01:32:58.640
And then as soon as I said, I want to beat your face,

01:32:58.640 --> 01:33:01.200
I was like, I'm not mad at you anymore.

01:33:01.200 --> 01:33:04.720
Because we've been, you guys have been together 25 years.

01:33:04.720 --> 01:33:05.600
Try 30.

01:33:05.600 --> 01:33:06.160
Yeah.

01:33:06.160 --> 01:33:07.160
Really, really?

01:33:07.160 --> 01:33:08.360
And try not fucking.

01:33:11.600 --> 01:33:14.160
See if, try that.

01:33:14.160 --> 01:33:14.920
Yeah.

01:33:14.920 --> 01:33:19.320
Work with Steve Silverman for 25 years and don't fuck him.

01:33:19.320 --> 01:33:21.720
See if you can handle this shit.

01:33:21.720 --> 01:33:23.200
Because you can't.

01:33:23.200 --> 01:33:24.000
All right.

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:27.720
Like, it gets fucking, it gets on your nerves sometimes.

01:33:27.720 --> 01:33:31.040
This guy, Christopher Durang.

01:33:31.040 --> 01:33:32.680
I'm like, fuck you.

01:33:32.680 --> 01:33:34.600
I didn't really do what the fuck, man.

01:33:34.600 --> 01:33:38.120
And why didn't you let my panic in the disco show?

01:33:38.120 --> 01:33:39.280
Everyone wants a show.

01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:42.800
I'm trying to make your life better by adding humor.

01:33:42.800 --> 01:33:45.280
You're trying to make your life better.

01:33:45.280 --> 01:33:47.160
Adding spice.

01:33:47.160 --> 01:33:48.280
Why don't you guys just fuck?

01:33:53.080 --> 01:33:54.920
Finally.

01:33:54.920 --> 01:33:55.840
You know what?

01:33:55.840 --> 01:34:00.120
I would, except it would be a disservice to the gay community.

01:34:00.120 --> 01:34:02.400
Because it would be too straight, guys.

01:34:02.400 --> 01:34:05.080
Reinforcing the idea that fucking is about power.

01:34:05.080 --> 01:34:07.200
I think after seven years of Harmontown,

01:34:07.200 --> 01:34:10.120
it's high time for some heterosexual grudge fucking.

01:34:10.120 --> 01:34:11.120
Yeah, I don't know.

01:34:11.120 --> 01:34:12.480
I won't take part of that.

01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:15.920
But it was like, look, like, Schrab wrote,

01:34:15.920 --> 01:34:18.080
like, it'll be 70 years from now.

01:34:18.080 --> 01:34:19.480
The way Rick and Morty's schedule goes.

01:34:19.480 --> 01:34:21.360
Schrab wrote an amazing script.

01:34:21.360 --> 01:34:22.800
Schrab is a great writer.

01:34:22.800 --> 01:34:24.440
Schrab is on Rick and Morty now.

01:34:24.440 --> 01:34:27.760
Schrab did a great job.

01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:30.480
That's why I don't know why he's being such a fucking cock

01:34:30.480 --> 01:34:31.520
all the time.

01:34:31.520 --> 01:34:34.880
Like, I'm just sitting and I'm like,

01:34:34.880 --> 01:34:37.640
it's just like, I go in and I go, like, hey, guys,

01:34:37.640 --> 01:34:39.600
what if the story was about a thing?

01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:40.560
It was about a thing.

01:34:40.560 --> 01:34:42.440
And then Schrab's like, about a thing?

01:34:46.040 --> 01:34:47.480
But that's why Schrab is the greatest.

01:34:47.480 --> 01:34:49.560
What are you, a fucking eight?

01:34:49.560 --> 01:34:50.200
I don't know.

01:34:50.200 --> 01:34:51.000
I don't know what to tell you.

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:52.000
Well, how am I supposed to do it, right?

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:53.360
I don't know what to tell you.

01:34:53.360 --> 01:34:55.280
No, I'm not going to let you do that to me.

01:34:55.280 --> 01:34:59.000
I'm not going to let you tell me what to tell you.

01:34:59.000 --> 01:34:59.680
I don't care.

01:34:59.680 --> 01:35:01.680
I'm glad you're there.

01:35:01.680 --> 01:35:07.360
Dan, have you been on a show not as the top?

01:35:07.360 --> 01:35:08.920
Like, have you ever been in Schrab's position

01:35:08.920 --> 01:35:09.680
where you're writing?

01:35:09.680 --> 01:35:11.600
I mean, you have at least a couple times, right?

01:35:11.600 --> 01:35:13.560
Like in award ceremonies or whatever.

01:35:13.560 --> 01:35:14.200
As a writer.

01:35:14.200 --> 01:35:15.200
Like, you're a staffer.

01:35:15.200 --> 01:35:17.000
Yeah, and it didn't go well.

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:18.960
I'm not trying to got you or you or whatever.

01:35:18.960 --> 01:35:19.800
But it's just like.

01:35:19.800 --> 01:35:20.600
No, no, yeah.

01:35:20.600 --> 01:35:22.200
Yeah, you're exactly right.

01:35:22.200 --> 01:35:22.840
I'm just wondering.

01:35:22.840 --> 01:35:29.520
The capacity is like award shows for which I won an award.

01:35:29.520 --> 01:35:33.200
Because that's how you work for.

01:35:33.200 --> 01:35:36.600
Yeah, we got the same Emmy.

01:35:36.600 --> 01:35:38.840
I took mine home.

01:35:38.840 --> 01:35:39.840
Yeah, I got mine, too.

01:35:39.840 --> 01:35:41.120
OK, great.

01:35:41.120 --> 01:35:43.760
I mean, it doesn't, yeah.

01:35:43.760 --> 01:35:45.640
But like, like, it.

01:35:45.640 --> 01:35:47.160
Got the same.

01:35:47.160 --> 01:35:50.400
Yeah, it absolutely is a flaw of mine that I did not.

01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:51.480
See, he likes me.

01:35:51.480 --> 01:35:52.680
I was just wondering.

01:35:52.680 --> 01:35:56.680
This is what somebody who likes me looks like.

01:35:56.680 --> 01:35:57.160
See?

01:35:57.160 --> 01:35:57.640
Wow.

01:35:57.640 --> 01:35:58.680
I am not taking sides.

01:35:58.680 --> 01:35:59.960
Yeah, you are.

01:35:59.960 --> 01:36:00.400
Yeah, you are.

01:36:00.400 --> 01:36:02.680
Who's the potassium and who's the nitrate?

01:36:02.680 --> 01:36:03.920
Yeah, I want to know.

01:36:03.920 --> 01:36:05.000
That's all I want to know.

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.840
All right, now let's get back to these guys for Christ's sake.

01:36:07.840 --> 01:36:08.720
Let me ask you a question.

01:36:08.720 --> 01:36:09.200
OK.

01:36:09.200 --> 01:36:12.480
Since the show is winding down, this is the penultimate show,

01:36:12.480 --> 01:36:14.480
is there anything that you guys have always

01:36:14.480 --> 01:36:17.320
wanted to say to each other that's been like, building up?

01:36:17.320 --> 01:36:20.440
Ooh, it's holding up.

01:36:20.440 --> 01:36:22.760
Look, man.

01:36:22.760 --> 01:36:26.400
You'd never close your eyes anymore when I kiss for you.

01:36:26.400 --> 01:36:27.400
I know.

01:36:27.400 --> 01:36:30.880
I will say to you, Steve Silverman,

01:36:30.880 --> 01:36:34.840
it has always been a huge thing for Schrab.

01:36:38.200 --> 01:36:42.680
Like, this idea of me as an unavailable person,

01:36:42.680 --> 01:36:46.800
like, this whole thing, like, oh, Dan Harmon's so hard.

01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:49.200
He's so, like, yeah.

01:36:49.200 --> 01:36:50.480
It's so easy for him.

01:36:50.480 --> 01:36:51.280
So what?

01:36:51.280 --> 01:36:51.780
What?

01:36:51.780 --> 01:36:53.080
You didn't finish your sentence.

01:36:53.080 --> 01:36:56.160
What am I saying all the time?

01:36:56.160 --> 01:36:58.000
See, so what am I?

01:36:58.000 --> 01:36:58.600
What?

01:36:58.600 --> 01:36:59.240
What?

01:36:59.240 --> 01:37:03.480
You did an amazing job on that script.

01:37:03.480 --> 01:37:07.000
Like, it is my dream come true that you're

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:08.480
working on the show.

01:37:08.480 --> 01:37:11.520
Like, my heart bursts when I wake up in the morning.

01:37:11.520 --> 01:37:13.880
I'm like, the shit that I've been going through,

01:37:13.880 --> 01:37:17.040
I'm like, Schrab's on the show now.

01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:19.000
Like, it's like, holy shit.

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.680
It's like a comfort around me.

01:37:21.680 --> 01:37:24.960
I'm like, even if I'm like, it's so great.

01:37:24.960 --> 01:37:27.560
Like, the work that you've done.

01:37:27.560 --> 01:37:29.800
Like, that's how I express love.

01:37:29.800 --> 01:37:31.080
Yeah.

01:37:31.080 --> 01:37:32.600
Yeah.

01:37:32.600 --> 01:37:35.160
So, yeah.

01:37:35.160 --> 01:37:37.560
And that applause says that that's all the love I

01:37:37.560 --> 01:37:40.480
need to express.

01:37:40.480 --> 01:37:45.760
And so any need beyond that is the need of a faulty person.

01:37:45.760 --> 01:37:47.640
Right?

01:37:47.640 --> 01:37:49.560
Everyone agrees.

01:37:49.560 --> 01:37:53.800
A chemistry teacher, a journalist, both dead fought.

01:37:53.800 --> 01:37:57.160
Everyone agrees that if you need emotionally,

01:37:57.160 --> 01:37:59.800
you're crippled.

01:37:59.800 --> 01:38:02.360
Because you could get everything you need from me

01:38:02.360 --> 01:38:05.920
through output.

01:38:05.920 --> 01:38:07.840
You've done such a good job.

01:38:07.840 --> 01:38:09.080
Dan, Dan, you fucked it.

01:38:09.080 --> 01:38:10.640
You fucked it there, right?

01:38:10.640 --> 01:38:12.000
I wasn't trying to not fuck it.

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:13.160
You had us and you lost us.

01:38:13.160 --> 01:38:16.120
No, I'm proving my philosophy true.

01:38:16.120 --> 01:38:17.640
You're saying the only reason that you love him

01:38:17.640 --> 01:38:20.800
is his value to your output, your product.

01:38:24.720 --> 01:38:26.040
I made.

01:38:26.040 --> 01:38:27.320
And I made.

01:38:27.320 --> 01:38:27.960
I'm sad.

01:38:27.960 --> 01:38:29.440
His motherfucker likes sting.

01:38:29.440 --> 01:38:31.560
What are you supposed to just love people and then you're

01:38:31.560 --> 01:38:33.480
like, hey, I love you.

01:38:33.480 --> 01:38:35.120
Come upstairs.

01:38:35.120 --> 01:38:36.360
Put this pen in your hand.

01:38:36.360 --> 01:38:38.200
What if you can write the show?

01:38:38.200 --> 01:38:39.520
No, that would be awful.

01:38:42.920 --> 01:38:45.520
Do you love him as a friend, as an emotional asset,

01:38:45.520 --> 01:38:50.040
as an ally in your travels and surveillance?

01:38:50.040 --> 01:38:52.360
It's so awkward.

01:38:52.360 --> 01:38:59.200
He's my brother in a world where there aren't any.

01:38:59.200 --> 01:39:07.640
That's like, this means, what do people want from me?

01:39:07.640 --> 01:39:09.960
It's like, why does everybody start laughing at that stuff?

01:39:09.960 --> 01:39:12.400
I'm like, oh, hey, Dan, do a pull-up.

01:39:12.400 --> 01:39:14.280
And then I start doing a pull-up and everyone's like,

01:39:14.280 --> 01:39:17.320
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

01:39:17.320 --> 01:39:19.600
He's your brother, but say why, like, break it down.

01:39:19.600 --> 01:39:20.720
Well, what, he's my brother.

01:39:20.720 --> 01:39:25.640
Like, like, wait, like, wait, like, forever.

01:39:25.640 --> 01:39:26.720
Yeah.

01:39:26.720 --> 01:39:27.440
Why?

01:39:27.440 --> 01:39:29.520
I get it.

01:39:29.520 --> 01:39:32.160
Why is everybody, like, why is always the theme of the show

01:39:32.160 --> 01:39:34.280
is always like, oh, you guys, like, what do you

01:39:34.280 --> 01:39:36.040
want me to say, like, I love you?

01:39:36.040 --> 01:39:37.480
Like, that's so fucking dumb.

01:39:37.480 --> 01:39:38.480
Do you?

01:39:38.480 --> 01:39:40.840
Well, like, what does it mean if you don't mean it?

01:39:40.840 --> 01:39:42.000
Like, what do we say?

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:45.040
No.

01:39:45.040 --> 01:39:47.280
I don't know what those words mean.

01:39:47.280 --> 01:39:49.080
What does it mean?

01:39:49.080 --> 01:39:50.920
Those words can be low eyes.

01:39:50.920 --> 01:39:52.200
People can go, I love Hitler.

01:39:52.200 --> 01:39:53.000
They don't mean it.

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.920
Like, if you don't love Hitler, like, that

01:39:55.920 --> 01:39:57.040
means you love racism.

01:39:57.040 --> 01:39:57.720
Just stop.

01:39:57.720 --> 01:39:59.840
Just stop.

01:39:59.840 --> 01:40:03.000
See, you guys lured me into this fucking trap.

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:04.560
This is what always happens to me.

01:40:04.560 --> 01:40:07.280
Hey, Dan, why don't you express yourself as a person?

01:40:07.280 --> 01:40:09.280
Fucking pussy.

01:40:09.280 --> 01:40:11.840
Fucking shit face.

01:40:11.840 --> 01:40:15.760
You know, you fucking, like, you're neurodiverse.

01:40:15.760 --> 01:40:17.840
Fucking shit face.

01:40:17.840 --> 01:40:19.360
Like, they lure me into this trap.

01:40:19.360 --> 01:40:20.760
Just say you love Rob Schrab.

01:40:20.760 --> 01:40:22.840
Whatever I do, I love Rob Schrab.

01:40:22.840 --> 01:40:24.240
This is his Billy Zane.

01:40:24.240 --> 01:40:26.840
Will you leave him alone?

01:40:26.840 --> 01:40:28.960
God, he doesn't want to do Billy Zane.

01:40:28.960 --> 01:40:29.840
I'll give you a choice.

01:40:29.840 --> 01:40:33.320
Either do Billy Zane or tell Rob you love him and made it.

01:40:33.320 --> 01:40:35.320
Why do you guys always say, I love Rob Schrab.

01:40:35.320 --> 01:40:36.960
I don't want to do Billy Zane.

01:40:36.960 --> 01:40:38.160
Yeah.

01:40:38.160 --> 01:40:38.920
Yeah.

01:40:38.920 --> 01:40:42.560
What do you guys want?

01:40:42.560 --> 01:40:46.400
I don't approve of any of this.

01:40:46.400 --> 01:40:49.280
Is that just like, is that what the Midwest is?

01:40:49.280 --> 01:40:50.800
Is just that much withholding?

01:40:50.800 --> 01:40:51.600
I don't know.

01:40:51.600 --> 01:40:54.400
It's just an idea of I love you, I love you, I love you.

01:40:54.400 --> 01:40:56.720
It's like a fucking poker chip you put on the table.

01:40:56.720 --> 01:40:58.920
Like, what the fuck does it mean?

01:40:58.920 --> 01:41:01.680
Like, it means you, like, got a chip at the fucking cashier.

01:41:01.680 --> 01:41:03.080
Dad's like, I love you.

01:41:03.080 --> 01:41:04.720
Like, people go, I love you.

01:41:04.720 --> 01:41:05.600
I love you, too.

01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:06.440
Like, I'm trying.

01:41:06.440 --> 01:41:08.720
Like, Cody's family, like, they say it.

01:41:08.720 --> 01:41:09.600
And I believe them.

01:41:09.600 --> 01:41:11.040
And I'm like, I love you, too.

01:41:11.040 --> 01:41:14.720
It's like, hard for me to say it to Cody's dad.

01:41:14.720 --> 01:41:17.160
But like, those people say, I love you.

01:41:17.160 --> 01:41:19.400
Like, they're fucking just hanging out.

01:41:19.400 --> 01:41:20.720
Like, it's just like farting.

01:41:20.720 --> 01:41:21.560
And I was like, I love you.

01:41:21.560 --> 01:41:24.920
I'm like, I don't know, I don't know what I mean.

01:41:24.920 --> 01:41:26.840
That's like, this is not the family I come from.

01:41:26.840 --> 01:41:30.000
It's just like, like, those words mean something.

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:31.040
Can you help me out here?

01:41:31.040 --> 01:41:32.200
What's your love language?

01:41:32.200 --> 01:41:34.520
Because it sounds like words of affirmation aren't it.

01:41:34.520 --> 01:41:36.040
But you got to have one.

01:41:36.040 --> 01:41:37.160
Good boy.

01:41:37.160 --> 01:41:39.560
I mean, it's not like, this is a normal thing that happens.

01:41:39.560 --> 01:41:41.720
People are like, I don't want all these fucking gifts,

01:41:41.720 --> 01:41:42.720
you know, or whatever.

01:41:42.720 --> 01:41:46.520
With Cody, it's like, like, all bets are off.

01:41:46.520 --> 01:41:47.240
It's just whatever.

01:41:47.240 --> 01:41:51.320
And I think that maybe part of the problem is that I go,

01:41:51.320 --> 01:41:52.880
oh, that's an intimacy thing.

01:41:52.880 --> 01:41:55.160
Like, love is for partners.

01:41:55.160 --> 01:41:57.400
And that makes it maybe sexual.

01:41:57.400 --> 01:42:00.200
And so maybe then you're not supposed to say,

01:42:00.200 --> 01:42:03.080
I love you to people that you're not partners with.

01:42:03.080 --> 01:42:05.240
Well, Keith and Steve, 25 years.

01:42:05.240 --> 01:42:08.760
Like, can you define what love is between you two?

01:42:08.760 --> 01:42:11.200
Yeah, we don't want to kill each other.

01:42:11.200 --> 01:42:13.800
Well, we take the desire to kill each other,

01:42:13.800 --> 01:42:16.720
and we crumple it down into a tiny little ball.

01:42:16.720 --> 01:42:18.200
Are you guys, it's Thanksgiving.

01:42:18.200 --> 01:42:19.440
What do you guys do?

01:42:19.440 --> 01:42:22.880
How are your relationships with your family?

01:42:22.880 --> 01:42:25.040
But that's important.

01:42:25.040 --> 01:42:26.400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:42:26.400 --> 01:42:28.880
But you.

01:42:28.880 --> 01:42:29.960
Thanks.

01:42:29.960 --> 01:42:32.920
Are your families hip to your relationship?

01:42:32.920 --> 01:42:35.200
Oh, yeah, they are.

01:42:35.200 --> 01:42:38.800
But there are some political issues.

01:42:38.800 --> 01:42:42.680
My family is liberal, and Keith's family not so much.

01:42:42.680 --> 01:42:45.240
So the last three years have been terrible for us

01:42:45.240 --> 01:42:46.840
in that regard, actually.

01:42:46.840 --> 01:42:51.440
Really, it was the election that actually created a divide.

01:42:51.440 --> 01:42:53.880
The election and the propaganda wave.

01:42:53.880 --> 01:42:55.280
Because it brought it to the fore.

01:42:55.280 --> 01:42:56.160
It's true.

01:42:56.160 --> 01:42:59.080
I mean, my mother-in-law literally

01:42:59.080 --> 01:43:01.600
made us lovely embroidered tea towels

01:43:01.600 --> 01:43:04.120
with her name before the election.

01:43:04.120 --> 01:43:05.720
But there's been a breach.

01:43:05.720 --> 01:43:09.080
When you guys first declared your love to your families,

01:43:09.080 --> 01:43:12.720
were they both sides OK with it, or was it a little rough?

01:43:12.720 --> 01:43:15.120
Oh, you have a great story on this one.

01:43:15.120 --> 01:43:18.240
What the, when my dad pulled you aside.

01:43:18.240 --> 01:43:19.720
Oh, yeah, that's right.

01:43:19.720 --> 01:43:22.560
I was scared to meet Keith's family,

01:43:22.560 --> 01:43:24.440
because they're like Midwesters.

01:43:24.440 --> 01:43:27.480
Keith's dad was literally the mayor of Normal, Illinois.

01:43:30.480 --> 01:43:31.680
I've been there.

01:43:31.680 --> 01:43:35.720
Just outside of not gay Wisconsin.

01:43:35.720 --> 01:43:38.920
I think a bit more as flat kids.

01:43:38.920 --> 01:43:41.520
Neuro-typical Wisconsin.

01:43:41.520 --> 01:43:43.680
There are trucks all over that town

01:43:43.680 --> 01:43:46.080
that say normal police.

01:43:46.080 --> 01:43:47.240
That's so cool.

01:43:47.240 --> 01:43:49.680
Nothing to see here.com.

01:43:49.680 --> 01:43:53.480
But so when I met them, I'm a Jewish Fagola,

01:43:53.480 --> 01:43:57.840
12 years older than their beautiful blonde son.

01:43:57.840 --> 01:44:00.240
My parents were communists, et cetera.

01:44:00.240 --> 01:44:03.120
Yeah, I don't think they knew that at the time.

01:44:03.120 --> 01:44:06.920
But I thought that I might be their worst nightmare, frankly.

01:44:06.920 --> 01:44:10.320
But Keith's dad took me aside and said,

01:44:10.320 --> 01:44:12.320
we know that you're very special to Keith,

01:44:12.320 --> 01:44:13.960
so you're very special to us.

01:44:13.960 --> 01:44:14.560
That's awesome.

01:44:14.560 --> 01:44:15.880
And that was wonderful.

01:44:15.880 --> 01:44:17.000
I don't want to fucking die.

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:21.320
So I hope we can find our way back to that.

01:44:21.320 --> 01:44:23.040
Yeah.

01:44:23.040 --> 01:44:24.840
Those stories over and over again,

01:44:24.840 --> 01:44:29.800
every time there's a face-to-face encounter,

01:44:29.800 --> 01:44:33.560
I don't want to publicize anybody.

01:44:33.560 --> 01:44:34.840
I don't want to out them.

01:44:34.840 --> 01:44:38.400
I have a family member who's there in a certain neighborhood

01:44:38.400 --> 01:44:43.360
and in their neighborhood.

01:44:43.360 --> 01:44:47.840
There's a guy who's a very popular cool guy

01:44:47.840 --> 01:44:50.400
and all the kids play in his yard.

01:44:50.400 --> 01:44:51.920
And he's a super cool guy.

01:44:51.920 --> 01:44:56.760
He's like a stand-up, amazing, cool neighborhood dad guy.

01:44:56.760 --> 01:44:58.880
And he has a flagpole in his backyard.

01:44:58.880 --> 01:45:01.760
And he went to some fucking, he went off on some trip.

01:45:01.760 --> 01:45:04.080
And he had a great time and good for him.

01:45:04.080 --> 01:45:05.000
And he paid his money.

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.280
And he came back with this MAGA flag.

01:45:07.280 --> 01:45:11.160
And he hoisted it up on his backyard flagpole.

01:45:11.160 --> 01:45:16.200
And this friend of mine that all she could see out

01:45:16.200 --> 01:45:19.560
her back window was this guy's flag,

01:45:19.560 --> 01:45:21.160
which is where my story would end.

01:45:21.160 --> 01:45:22.480
I would just come on this podcast

01:45:22.480 --> 01:45:24.920
and I'd go, hey, the next door to a piece of shit

01:45:24.920 --> 01:45:26.880
is flying his flag.

01:45:26.880 --> 01:45:30.440
She went, she talked to him and said,

01:45:30.440 --> 01:45:32.520
which I wouldn't recommend.

01:45:32.520 --> 01:45:35.840
I just said, suddenly I'm not on her side

01:45:35.840 --> 01:45:40.400
for that moment where she goes up to him and goes,

01:45:40.400 --> 01:45:44.960
that's not really a flag about our country or our state

01:45:44.960 --> 01:45:45.880
or our city.

01:45:45.880 --> 01:45:48.920
It's a flag about this political platform.

01:45:48.920 --> 01:45:51.120
And it's like, all I can see out my back window

01:45:51.120 --> 01:45:52.800
and you're so cool to our kids.

01:45:52.800 --> 01:45:56.360
And I just, it's right in my face.

01:45:56.360 --> 01:45:57.360
I look out my window.

01:45:57.360 --> 01:45:59.240
And the guy's response was like, you're right.

01:45:59.240 --> 01:46:00.160
It's pretty obnoxious.

01:46:00.160 --> 01:46:01.160
And he took it down.

01:46:01.160 --> 01:46:01.660
Nice.

01:46:01.660 --> 01:46:02.160
Wow.

01:46:02.160 --> 01:46:03.680
That's every story.

01:46:03.680 --> 01:46:05.360
Every story.

01:46:05.360 --> 01:46:09.400
Like there aren't any stories about actual human beings

01:46:09.400 --> 01:46:12.200
talking to each other where then someone pulls out

01:46:12.200 --> 01:46:15.400
a machete and goes like, I love Trump.

01:46:15.400 --> 01:46:18.360
Or I love socialism.

01:46:18.360 --> 01:46:20.760
Any time people are talking to each other,

01:46:20.760 --> 01:46:25.000
it's basically like, what the fuck are you going to do?

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:25.480
Anyways.

01:46:25.480 --> 01:46:27.680
Well, that's one thing we have to fight our way out of

01:46:27.680 --> 01:46:31.440
is everybody stereotyping everybody else and having these.

01:46:31.440 --> 01:46:34.960
That's the, that will be the irony of the internet

01:46:34.960 --> 01:46:41.440
is like we all got connected and it disconnected all of us.

01:46:41.440 --> 01:46:43.760
Like more than we had ever been.

01:46:43.760 --> 01:46:48.280
Because when we were all just trapped in apartments

01:46:48.280 --> 01:46:53.880
watching Welcome Back Connor on a TV, our intro back

01:46:53.880 --> 01:46:56.160
Connor.

01:46:56.160 --> 01:47:00.360
Our internet was talking to the random stranger

01:47:00.360 --> 01:47:03.680
that we did laundry with in the shared laundry room.

01:47:03.680 --> 01:47:09.240
And the internet now tells us, and not unrightfully so,

01:47:09.240 --> 01:47:13.520
but tells us like that guy that's doing laundry with you,

01:47:13.520 --> 01:47:17.000
he's a much smaller piece of the puzzle.

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:20.880
Like if you're a true crime fan, that guy's

01:47:20.880 --> 01:47:23.800
going to kill your daughter and eat her.

01:47:23.800 --> 01:47:28.400
Like it makes more sense to compartmentalize that person

01:47:28.400 --> 01:47:30.240
that way.

01:47:30.240 --> 01:47:39.160
The internet, we thought it was going to end disconnection.

01:47:39.160 --> 01:47:41.800
It was like a short circuit.

01:47:41.800 --> 01:47:43.160
I love that movie.

01:47:43.160 --> 01:47:44.440
Yeah.

01:47:44.440 --> 01:47:49.240
It has revealed to us all that we would rather

01:47:49.240 --> 01:47:52.000
be who we were yesterday.

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.640
And we would like to take that person

01:47:54.640 --> 01:47:59.720
that we were yesterday onto the tomorrow of online

01:47:59.720 --> 01:48:02.480
and say, hey, here's me.

01:48:02.480 --> 01:48:04.240
Because who wants to dissolve and do

01:48:04.240 --> 01:48:06.920
a bunch of nothingness of tomorrow?

01:48:06.920 --> 01:48:10.800
Maybe that's an uplifting thing about us.

01:48:10.800 --> 01:48:12.000
God damn it, Harmon.

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:13.320
Don't waste your.

01:48:13.320 --> 01:48:15.000
All right, what time is it?

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:16.120
Did we do a full podcast?

01:48:16.120 --> 01:48:16.840
Almost.

01:48:16.840 --> 01:48:17.320
Almost.

01:48:17.320 --> 01:48:18.920
Let's do a rap.

01:48:18.920 --> 01:48:21.560
I mean, I'm not saying let's do a rap,

01:48:21.560 --> 01:48:22.800
but that's the time.

01:48:22.800 --> 01:48:25.120
Would it be tedious and tiresome to just shout out

01:48:25.120 --> 01:48:27.320
everybody that came from a long distance away?

01:48:27.320 --> 01:48:28.920
That's what I feel like we owe them,

01:48:28.920 --> 01:48:31.960
like let's bring all the yahoos.

01:48:31.960 --> 01:48:33.960
I know we got Sarah and Austin.

01:48:33.960 --> 01:48:34.960
You guys came.

01:48:34.960 --> 01:48:38.120
Chico, we got.

01:48:38.120 --> 01:48:39.680
Where?

01:48:39.680 --> 01:48:40.800
Salem.

01:48:40.800 --> 01:48:42.520
Saudi Arabia?

01:48:42.520 --> 01:48:43.680
For real?

01:48:43.680 --> 01:48:45.440
And we have England here too?

01:48:45.440 --> 01:48:46.960
Yeah.

01:48:46.960 --> 01:48:47.720
Australia?

01:48:47.720 --> 01:48:49.440
Australia.

01:48:49.440 --> 01:48:50.160
Austria.

01:48:50.160 --> 01:48:51.720
I heard Chicago.

01:48:51.720 --> 01:48:52.440
How about it?

01:48:52.440 --> 01:48:53.560
All at the same time.

01:48:53.560 --> 01:48:55.160
Portraits.

01:48:55.160 --> 01:48:58.920
Don't you think there's some way to line people up

01:48:58.920 --> 01:49:01.800
and just have them saying to a microphone like,

01:49:01.800 --> 01:49:06.800
I'm from Melbourne, Australia, and raisins are great.

01:49:06.800 --> 01:49:07.480
Wait, how about this?

01:49:07.480 --> 01:49:08.640
Yeah, let's do it.

01:49:08.640 --> 01:49:12.680
People that came for real, that came from out of, like,

01:49:12.680 --> 01:49:15.560
way out of town to come to the show, like stand up,

01:49:15.560 --> 01:49:16.920
and maybe we'll just bring you up,

01:49:16.920 --> 01:49:18.040
and we'll just all say hello to you.

01:49:18.040 --> 01:49:19.840
Maybe like line up by the staircase

01:49:19.840 --> 01:49:20.800
Yeah, just come on up.

01:49:20.800 --> 01:49:22.640
It was the whole audience.

01:49:22.640 --> 01:49:24.760
I'm going to give the guys the average show.

01:49:24.760 --> 01:49:25.480
Geez, crazy.

01:49:25.480 --> 01:49:25.960
What's up?

01:49:25.960 --> 01:49:27.960
That's a good idea.

01:49:27.960 --> 01:49:28.960
All right.

01:49:28.960 --> 01:49:31.960
Yeah.

01:49:31.960 --> 01:49:34.360
It could have been off the stage.

01:49:34.360 --> 01:49:36.240
Rob, take your mic and interview everybody

01:49:36.240 --> 01:49:37.440
and tell them hello.

01:49:37.440 --> 01:49:38.800
It's your idea, Jeff.

01:49:38.800 --> 01:49:41.720
You handle this.

01:49:41.720 --> 01:49:43.320
It's the entire audience.

01:49:43.320 --> 01:49:46.120
How could this possibly go wrong?

01:49:46.120 --> 01:49:47.120
All controls.

01:49:47.120 --> 01:49:48.440
You sir, where are you from?

01:49:48.440 --> 01:49:49.440
I mean, this is good.

01:49:49.440 --> 01:49:51.080
Salem, Oregon, and what's your name?

01:49:51.080 --> 01:49:52.240
Yeah, you can have a seat.

01:49:52.240 --> 01:49:53.000
Nathan Jones.

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.960
Nathan Jones, what's your worst fear?

01:49:55.960 --> 01:50:01.040
Oh, I guess having my head cut off, but not dying.

01:50:01.040 --> 01:50:02.760
And so you're just like this in my head.

01:50:02.760 --> 01:50:03.400
That's a good one.

01:50:03.400 --> 01:50:04.600
That sounds awesome.

01:50:04.600 --> 01:50:05.960
No, but you couldn't do anything.

01:50:05.960 --> 01:50:08.960
That's like a terrible way to die.

01:50:08.960 --> 01:50:10.840
I'm sorry, the correct answer was panthers.

01:50:10.840 --> 01:50:11.520
Thank you very much.

01:50:11.520 --> 01:50:12.440
Good to meet you.

01:50:12.440 --> 01:50:14.440
That was the worst fear ever.

01:50:14.440 --> 01:50:15.000
Colorado.

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:15.720
Colorado.

01:50:15.720 --> 01:50:16.400
What was it?

01:50:16.400 --> 01:50:17.320
But not dying.

01:50:17.320 --> 01:50:18.360
Well, Denver.

01:50:18.360 --> 01:50:19.000
Denver Boulder.

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:19.840
Denver, Boulder.

01:50:19.840 --> 01:50:20.880
You guys can't agree on this.

01:50:20.880 --> 01:50:22.160
You guys from different cities?

01:50:22.160 --> 01:50:24.320
Yes.

01:50:24.320 --> 01:50:26.720
What was the worst thing that ever happened to you

01:50:26.720 --> 01:50:28.800
in Boulder, Colorado?

01:50:28.800 --> 01:50:31.280
Oh, dear lord, you don't even want to know.

01:50:31.280 --> 01:50:32.320
We literally asked.

01:50:32.320 --> 01:50:37.040
It'll take way too long.

01:50:37.040 --> 01:50:39.240
Just give us the setting.

01:50:39.240 --> 01:50:40.480
What was the place?

01:50:40.480 --> 01:50:41.560
Too many tits out.

01:50:41.560 --> 01:50:42.440
Too many tits out.

01:50:42.440 --> 01:50:45.440
Let's give them up for Boulder, Colorado.

01:50:45.440 --> 01:50:47.240
You sir, you're wearing an Arsenal shirt.

01:50:47.240 --> 01:50:49.360
Sorry about your shitty team.

01:50:49.360 --> 01:50:51.040
Are you from London?

01:50:51.040 --> 01:50:51.800
Yeah, I'm here.

01:50:51.800 --> 01:50:52.560
Are you?

01:50:52.560 --> 01:50:54.200
Yeah, Arsenal's blowing it right now.

01:50:54.200 --> 01:50:54.760
Nice.

01:50:54.760 --> 01:50:55.120
Shit.

01:50:55.120 --> 01:50:56.040
Yeah, there's fucking rubbish.

01:50:56.040 --> 01:51:00.760
So they got that shitty coach and everybody's all shit.

01:51:00.760 --> 01:51:05.360
If you had one wish, what would it be?

01:51:05.360 --> 01:51:08.040
Oh, suck up shitty coach.

01:51:08.040 --> 01:51:10.600
Suck up shitty coach?

01:51:10.600 --> 01:51:12.000
I think he says English.

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:13.920
Thank you very much from Arsenal.

01:51:13.920 --> 01:51:15.360
London, where are you from, sir?

01:51:15.360 --> 01:51:16.880
Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.

01:51:16.880 --> 01:51:18.640
I love Edmonton.

01:51:18.640 --> 01:51:22.120
What's your favorite bar on White Avenue?

01:51:22.120 --> 01:51:23.520
Oh, you got to go to the Buckingham.

01:51:23.520 --> 01:51:24.600
Vegan food.

01:51:24.600 --> 01:51:25.480
Fuck yeah, I've been there.

01:51:25.480 --> 01:51:26.080
Yeah, all right.

01:51:26.080 --> 01:51:26.760
Oh, you're Samson.

01:51:26.760 --> 01:51:27.800
I met you before.

01:51:27.800 --> 01:51:31.160
Samson, he's the living rear incarnation of Brody Stevens.

01:51:31.160 --> 01:51:32.000
Let's give him up.

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:33.680
Thank you very much.

01:51:33.680 --> 01:51:36.600
Thank you very much.

01:51:36.600 --> 01:51:38.040
Eric, where are you from?

01:51:38.040 --> 01:51:38.920
Ibiza, Spain.

01:51:38.920 --> 01:51:39.440
Spain?

01:51:39.440 --> 01:51:39.760
Yeah.

01:51:39.760 --> 01:51:40.240
Ibiza?

01:51:40.240 --> 01:51:41.760
Nice.

01:51:41.760 --> 01:51:43.760
So are you Catalan?

01:51:43.760 --> 01:51:44.120
No.

01:51:44.120 --> 01:51:46.240
No, you're Castilla?

01:51:46.240 --> 01:51:48.560
Also, I'm German.

01:51:48.560 --> 01:51:49.520
Get the fuck out of here.

01:51:49.520 --> 01:51:50.200
Thank you very much.

01:51:50.200 --> 01:51:51.960
Welcome.

01:51:51.960 --> 01:51:52.440
Nick.

01:51:52.440 --> 01:51:53.640
Nick, where are you from, Nick?

01:51:53.640 --> 01:51:54.440
Bristol, England.

01:51:54.440 --> 01:51:55.320
Bristol, England.

01:51:55.320 --> 01:51:55.760
That's correct.

01:51:55.760 --> 01:51:57.000
What makes Bristol special?

01:51:57.000 --> 01:52:00.680
What is the claim to fame of Bristol, England?

01:52:00.680 --> 01:52:01.600
Pirates, I think.

01:52:01.600 --> 01:52:02.880
Pirates.

01:52:02.880 --> 01:52:04.760
OK, what's your name over here?

01:52:04.760 --> 01:52:06.640
Sorry, I'm just curious.

01:52:06.640 --> 01:52:07.560
What's your name?

01:52:07.560 --> 01:52:08.400
My name's Jubes.

01:52:08.400 --> 01:52:09.320
I'm from London.

01:52:09.320 --> 01:52:11.360
OK, and you love the Hulk?

01:52:11.360 --> 01:52:14.560
Yeah, he's a pretty cool guy, I guess.

01:52:14.560 --> 01:52:15.760
Like, because he gets mad, right?

01:52:15.760 --> 01:52:17.120
And then he turns into the Hulk.

01:52:17.120 --> 01:52:19.040
He does it better than anyone else.

01:52:19.040 --> 01:52:21.320
Are you going to get a selfie?

01:52:21.320 --> 01:52:23.600
OK, what's your friend of his?

01:52:23.600 --> 01:52:24.640
Or are you just a?

01:52:24.640 --> 01:52:25.320
We met today.

01:52:25.320 --> 01:52:26.640
OK, what's your name?

01:52:26.640 --> 01:52:27.640
Yves.

01:52:27.640 --> 01:52:28.680
Yves?

01:52:28.680 --> 01:52:29.200
OK.

01:52:29.200 --> 01:52:30.200
He's French.

01:52:30.200 --> 01:52:34.520
No, that's a bold choice.

01:52:34.520 --> 01:52:37.040
Are you a lumberjack?

01:52:37.040 --> 01:52:37.680
No, not.

01:52:37.680 --> 01:52:40.640
I know, I'm being racist.

01:52:40.640 --> 01:52:41.920
What are you?

01:52:41.920 --> 01:52:42.960
A software engineer.

01:52:42.960 --> 01:52:44.360
OK, that makes sense.

01:52:44.360 --> 01:52:45.760
Yves, the software engineer.

01:52:45.760 --> 01:52:47.800
Everybody, we got a star of her.

01:52:47.800 --> 01:52:49.200
Steven Notley from Edmonton.

01:52:49.200 --> 01:52:50.200
Steven Notley!

01:52:50.200 --> 01:52:53.240
Yeah, see, I don't know.

01:52:53.240 --> 01:52:56.760
Crater Bob the Angry Flower, one of our favorite comics.

01:52:56.760 --> 01:53:00.480
Steven, write a haiku for us right now.

01:53:00.480 --> 01:53:02.160
A haiku is five.

01:53:02.160 --> 01:53:03.200
Seven, five.

01:53:03.200 --> 01:53:11.960
A haiku is five syllables, and then seven, and then five again.

01:53:11.960 --> 01:53:12.440
Close enough.

01:53:12.440 --> 01:53:14.280
Just give it up for Steven Notley.

01:53:14.280 --> 01:53:17.160
OK, well, it's Edmonton Alberta.

01:53:17.160 --> 01:53:19.080
Edmonton Alberta, we thought the correct answer is

01:53:19.080 --> 01:53:20.320

Yeah, how do you know when you're finished?

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:29.640
All right, that's how you do it.

01:53:29.640 --> 01:53:30.520

Yeah, close enough.

01:53:45.800 --> 01:53:47.200
Yeah, all right.

01:53:47.200 --> 01:53:49.800
More like fart of.

01:53:49.800 --> 01:53:50.840
What's your name?

01:53:50.840 --> 01:53:51.560

Yeah, nailed it.

01:53:54.840 --> 01:53:56.000
Yeah, I remember you.

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:57.920
Fuck yeah, you're a memorable guy.

01:53:57.920 --> 01:53:58.720
I was just there.

01:53:58.720 --> 01:54:00.360
Have you been to Sunrise Breakfast?

01:54:00.360 --> 01:54:03.760
What's the place in the midtown?

01:54:03.760 --> 01:54:04.520
My studio?

01:54:04.520 --> 01:54:05.880
No, no, Near Sun Studios.

01:54:05.880 --> 01:54:09.080
Sunrise Breakfast joint.

01:54:09.080 --> 01:54:10.000
Never mind, you got to go there.

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:11.840
It's fucking great.

01:54:11.840 --> 01:54:12.640
Got a mirror there.

01:54:12.640 --> 01:54:13.600
All right.

01:54:13.600 --> 01:54:14.320
It's all lies.

01:54:14.320 --> 01:54:15.680
It's all lies tonight.

01:54:15.680 --> 01:54:17.000
Where are you from, sir?

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:17.680

01:54:17.680 --> 01:54:18.480

01:54:18.480 --> 01:54:20.360
Fair dinkum.

01:54:20.360 --> 01:54:23.440
Tell Dan if you like his hat or not.

01:54:23.440 --> 01:54:27.240
I like that hat, mate.

01:54:27.240 --> 01:54:28.080
That's Dominic.

01:54:28.080 --> 01:54:29.600
Dominic, I met you.

01:54:29.600 --> 01:54:30.960
I like that hat, mate.

01:54:30.960 --> 01:54:33.720

Sorry, my surname is McFadden, and that's

01:54:51.400 --> 01:54:52.680
what I got called at school.

01:54:52.680 --> 01:54:54.920

What's the best Wavis Frencheris?

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.000

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:11.000
Say it louder.

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:12.000
OK, thank you very much.

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:13.000

It's called Harmony Town.

01:55:20.840 --> 01:55:21.840
Yeah, I don't know.

01:55:21.840 --> 01:55:22.640
Who are you?

01:55:22.640 --> 01:55:23.280
I don't know.

01:55:23.280 --> 01:55:24.080
Juan, where are you from?

01:55:24.080 --> 01:55:25.200
This is a great ball.

01:55:25.200 --> 01:55:26.000
You've done Juan.

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:26.720
You've done them all.

01:55:26.720 --> 01:55:27.880
Get the fuck out of here.

It's got a bottle opener on it.

01:55:38.600 --> 01:55:39.280
There we go.

01:55:39.280 --> 01:55:40.760
It's got a bottle opener on it?

01:55:40.760 --> 01:55:43.720
That's, yeah, you're like, you're like the Batman of

01:55:43.720 --> 01:55:44.320
Alcoholics.

01:55:44.320 --> 01:55:45.520
That's fantastic.

And what's that weird bar called the Beaver or something?

01:55:55.600 --> 01:55:56.680

Yeah, there's a bar called the Beaver, the thing, I don't know.

01:55:59.920 --> 01:56:00.880
There's a lot of weird bars.

01:56:00.880 --> 01:56:02.240
I don't know the Beaver one.

01:56:02.240 --> 01:56:03.640
Yeah, well, that's what she said.

01:56:03.640 --> 01:56:05.440
All right, get out of here.

01:56:05.440 --> 01:56:06.680

01:56:16.440 --> 01:56:17.760
Keep on moving.

01:56:17.760 --> 01:56:19.240
We're almost halfway through.

01:56:19.240 --> 01:56:20.200

Just north of the Twin Cities.

01:56:28.400 --> 01:56:30.360
That's nothing.

01:56:30.360 --> 01:56:33.000
That can eat dicks according to my next friend.

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:37.080
Will, if you had one super power, one super power, Will.

01:56:37.080 --> 01:56:40.640
Jack says, to wear a t-shirt, fantastic, good to see you, Will.

01:56:40.640 --> 01:56:43.440
Jack says that that's fucking bullshit.

01:56:43.440 --> 01:56:45.520
Yeah, yeah, fucking.

01:56:45.520 --> 01:56:46.240
Shots fired.

01:56:46.240 --> 01:56:46.760

I got Carlos, Turk, and John over here.

01:56:59.640 --> 01:57:01.520
They're from Austin, Texas.

01:57:01.520 --> 01:57:03.160
Sound like some bullshit to me.

01:57:03.160 --> 01:57:05.720

01:57:09.920 --> 01:57:10.760
All right.

01:57:10.760 --> 01:57:11.960
Go get them, Austin.

01:57:11.960 --> 01:57:12.520
Hook them horns.

01:57:12.520 --> 01:57:13.680
Let's get this guy up here.

01:57:13.680 --> 01:57:14.080
Come on.

01:57:14.080 --> 01:57:15.880

He's from Crom?

01:57:20.920 --> 01:57:21.480
All right.

01:57:21.480 --> 01:57:22.600
He's Conan's god?

01:57:23.240 --> 01:57:23.840
Come on.

01:57:23.840 --> 01:57:24.680
Let's keep it moving.

01:57:24.680 --> 01:57:25.200
What the fuck?

01:57:25.200 --> 01:57:26.200
What are you talking about?

01:57:26.200 --> 01:57:27.400
What's your name?

01:57:27.400 --> 01:57:29.600
I'm talking about whatever.

01:57:29.600 --> 01:57:32.280
Just whatever is being talked about.

01:57:32.280 --> 01:57:33.360
And come on.

01:57:33.360 --> 01:57:34.840
This is Davis from Atlanta, Georgia.

01:57:34.840 --> 01:57:36.000
I live with Davis.

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:36.680
Fuck that guy.

01:57:36.680 --> 01:57:38.840
I lived in Atlanta for like a year, just last year.

01:57:38.840 --> 01:57:39.600

01:57:46.720 --> 01:57:48.280
If he's.

01:57:48.280 --> 01:57:49.280
That guy loves my aura.

01:57:49.280 --> 01:57:49.800
What do you say?

01:57:49.800 --> 01:57:50.680
He hates your aura.

01:57:50.680 --> 01:57:52.200
He hates your aura.

01:57:52.200 --> 01:57:53.200
Hates your aura.

01:57:53.200 --> 01:57:54.400
This guy loves my aura.

01:57:54.400 --> 01:57:55.320
Exactly, yeah.

01:57:55.320 --> 01:57:56.880
Shot's fired from Atlanta.

01:57:56.880 --> 01:57:57.600

01:57:58.080 --> 01:57:59.320
All right.

01:57:59.320 --> 01:58:00.760
What do you think about all this?

01:58:00.760 --> 01:58:02.720
The show ended five years ago, by the way.

01:58:07.320 --> 01:58:10.280

It's a town.

01:58:16.160 --> 01:58:19.040
There's a lot of corn in it.

01:58:19.040 --> 01:58:20.680
Close enough.

01:58:20.680 --> 01:58:22.680

There's a lot of it.

01:58:24.880 --> 01:58:26.320
Nobody's from here?

01:58:26.320 --> 01:58:27.040
I got it.

01:58:27.040 --> 01:58:28.360

01:58:31.720 --> 01:58:32.480
Jazz Nate.

01:58:32.480 --> 01:58:33.480
Jazz Nate.

01:58:33.480 --> 01:58:34.600
Jazz Nate.

01:58:34.600 --> 01:58:35.480
That's awesome.

01:58:35.480 --> 01:58:36.400
Where are you from, Jazz Nate?

01:58:36.400 --> 01:58:37.240
Sydney, Australia.

01:58:37.240 --> 01:58:39.160
Sydney, Australia.

01:58:39.160 --> 01:58:42.600
Is it, is Dinkum fair or unfair in Sydney, Australia?

01:58:42.600 --> 01:58:43.480
I think it's pretty fair.

01:58:43.480 --> 01:58:44.360
I guess it's Faye Dinkum.

01:58:44.360 --> 01:58:45.600
Thank you, Jazz Nate.

01:58:45.600 --> 01:58:47.200
I wonder what Danny from Vancouver

01:58:47.200 --> 01:58:49.400
would have to say about that.

01:58:49.400 --> 01:58:52.600
Dinkum moderate.

01:58:52.600 --> 01:58:53.120
All right.

01:58:53.120 --> 01:58:54.840
You, what's your name?

01:58:54.840 --> 01:58:57.400
All right, we're almost there.

01:58:57.400 --> 01:58:58.280
A Hart?

01:58:58.280 --> 01:59:00.040
A Hart from Milwaukee.

01:59:00.040 --> 01:59:01.440
Oh, shit.

01:59:01.440 --> 01:59:02.760
Harley Davidson.

01:59:02.760 --> 01:59:04.200
What ward are you from?

01:59:04.200 --> 01:59:05.360
Well, Ward.

01:59:05.360 --> 01:59:05.640
I don't know.

01:59:05.640 --> 01:59:06.240
What neighborhood?

01:59:06.240 --> 01:59:07.640
Third Ward.

01:59:07.640 --> 01:59:08.880
26 and Chambers.

01:59:08.880 --> 01:59:10.440
26 and Chambers.

01:59:10.440 --> 01:59:11.680
Did you ever do coke at that?

01:59:11.680 --> 01:59:13.400
What's that weird bar that we went to where they are?

01:59:13.400 --> 01:59:14.640
Why not, too?

01:59:14.640 --> 01:59:18.320
Libbies, that place is great.

01:59:18.320 --> 01:59:19.480
Ever go to Libby's?

01:59:19.480 --> 01:59:21.880
Don't go there because you'll get killed.

01:59:21.880 --> 01:59:24.120
Well, also, the coke is a step down.

01:59:24.120 --> 01:59:25.240
All right.

01:59:25.240 --> 01:59:26.240
What do you want to say?

01:59:26.240 --> 01:59:28.080
The show ends in two and a half hours, everybody.

01:59:28.080 --> 01:59:29.360
I'm from Memphis.

01:59:29.360 --> 01:59:30.360
You're from Hintas?

01:59:30.360 --> 01:59:30.960
Memphis.

01:59:30.960 --> 01:59:31.560
Memphis.

01:59:31.560 --> 01:59:33.280
For God's sake, it's music country.

01:59:33.280 --> 01:59:34.480
I was just there.

01:59:34.480 --> 01:59:36.320
Yeah.

01:59:36.320 --> 01:59:42.440
If Elvis were here, he would say, ah, shit.

01:59:42.440 --> 01:59:44.040
He'd be like, oh, I got everything.

01:59:44.040 --> 01:59:45.840
Screams, answers.

01:59:45.840 --> 01:59:46.320
All right.

01:59:46.320 --> 01:59:52.320
And what, do you think you could fight that guy?

01:59:52.320 --> 01:59:53.120
I'm too peaceful.

01:59:53.120 --> 01:59:53.620
Really?

01:59:53.620 --> 01:59:54.200
No, good.

01:59:54.200 --> 01:59:55.200
That's good.

01:59:55.200 --> 01:59:56.320
That means you're on my side.

01:59:56.320 --> 01:59:58.200
So if we have to fight him, I'm on your side.

01:59:58.200 --> 02:00:00.280
Dan, Dan, I'm going to blow your mind.

02:00:00.280 --> 02:00:03.560
I got Hadi over here from Saudi, motherfucking Arabia.

02:00:03.560 --> 02:00:04.560
Yeah.

02:00:04.560 --> 02:00:06.560
Yeah.

02:00:06.560 --> 02:00:12.560
I just want to say that North Divorcity crosses borders.

02:00:12.560 --> 02:00:13.400
All right.

02:00:13.400 --> 02:00:15.400
All right.

02:00:15.400 --> 02:00:17.840
How do you say, fuck your mama in,

02:00:17.840 --> 02:00:20.000
I fucked your mama in Arabic?

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:23.480
Kusum makb al-Arabi.

02:00:23.480 --> 02:00:26.400
He actually included the in Arabic part.

02:00:26.400 --> 02:00:27.480
See you, brother.

02:00:27.480 --> 02:00:27.980
All right.

02:00:27.980 --> 02:00:31.440
How do you say, fuck your mama in, I'm guessing, Delaware?

02:00:31.440 --> 02:00:33.320
It's Kansas.

02:00:33.320 --> 02:00:34.040
Where are you from?

02:00:34.040 --> 02:00:34.880
Kansas.

02:00:34.880 --> 02:00:36.640
How do you say, fuck your mama there?

02:00:36.640 --> 02:00:37.440
It's fuck your mama.

02:00:37.440 --> 02:00:38.720
OK, all right.

02:00:38.720 --> 02:00:39.680
What part of Kansas?

02:00:39.680 --> 02:00:40.760
Where in Kansas are you from?

02:00:40.760 --> 02:00:41.680
Calvin.

02:00:41.680 --> 02:00:42.360
Kansas.

02:00:42.360 --> 02:00:44.880
What part of Kansas?

02:00:44.880 --> 02:00:46.440
Kansas City.

02:00:46.440 --> 02:00:47.000
Kansas City.

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:47.400
Oh, yeah.

02:00:47.400 --> 02:00:48.240
The Kansas City part.

02:00:48.240 --> 02:00:50.480
Yeah, the shitty Kansas City.

02:00:50.480 --> 02:00:51.640
Yeah, well, don't.

02:00:51.640 --> 02:00:53.640
Yeah, it's all shit.

02:00:53.640 --> 02:00:55.400
Don't let him.

02:00:55.400 --> 02:00:59.280
No, don't be ashamed of yourself.

02:00:59.280 --> 02:01:01.760
Don't let me tell you what to do.

02:01:01.760 --> 02:01:07.720
Just trust me, but also don't.

02:01:07.720 --> 02:01:09.760
Yeah, I don't know what to tell you.

02:01:09.760 --> 02:01:12.080
This is Jacob from Austria, from Vienna, Austria.

02:01:12.080 --> 02:01:12.580
Awesome.

02:01:12.580 --> 02:01:16.200
All right.

02:01:16.200 --> 02:01:19.240
Best schnitzel in Los Angeles is?

02:01:19.240 --> 02:01:20.040
Vienna schnitzel?

02:01:20.040 --> 02:01:22.040
Yeah.

02:01:22.040 --> 02:01:23.400
Daphne Schnitzel, thank you.

02:01:23.400 --> 02:01:23.960
All right.

02:01:23.960 --> 02:01:25.120
That is the correct answer.

02:01:25.120 --> 02:01:26.520
Where are you from?

02:01:26.520 --> 02:01:27.480
I'm from Hawaii.

02:01:27.480 --> 02:01:28.800
Hawaii.

02:01:28.800 --> 02:01:31.760
Where's the best spam in Los Angeles?

02:01:31.760 --> 02:01:32.280
Everywhere.

02:01:32.280 --> 02:01:32.760
It's the same.

02:01:32.760 --> 02:01:34.440
Yeah, OK, spam comes to the end of the can.

02:01:34.440 --> 02:01:35.440
Yeah.

02:01:35.440 --> 02:01:38.960
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

02:01:38.960 --> 02:01:40.720
OK, all right, that's all.

02:01:40.720 --> 02:01:42.360
Don't let me make a break.

02:01:42.360 --> 02:01:44.600
Your line was short of the minute.

02:01:44.600 --> 02:01:46.720
Yeah, they want the fucking money.

02:01:46.720 --> 02:01:47.600
Where are you from?

02:01:47.600 --> 02:01:48.280
Washington.

02:01:48.280 --> 02:01:49.600
OK, good.

02:01:49.600 --> 02:01:50.080
All right.

02:01:50.080 --> 02:01:53.080
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

02:01:53.080 --> 02:01:54.160
That's fine.

02:01:54.160 --> 02:01:55.120
Where are you from?

02:01:55.120 --> 02:01:57.920
I live here, but this is our four-year anniversary,

02:01:57.920 --> 02:01:59.280
so I had to come say hello.

02:01:59.280 --> 02:02:00.360
Hey, how are you?

02:02:00.360 --> 02:02:02.240
Yeah.

02:02:02.240 --> 02:02:02.920
How are you?

02:02:02.920 --> 02:02:06.080
I just wanted to let you everybody know I cried a lot

02:02:06.080 --> 02:02:07.240
when I was on stage.

02:02:07.240 --> 02:02:10.760
And this show saved my life along with everybody else.

02:02:10.760 --> 02:02:13.640
And I'm a much happier, healthier person now,

02:02:13.640 --> 02:02:16.520
and just let y'all know that there's brightness out there

02:02:16.520 --> 02:02:17.320
too.

02:02:17.320 --> 02:02:18.800
Also, wait, hold on.

02:02:18.800 --> 02:02:20.480
I saw your Instagram story.

02:02:20.480 --> 02:02:21.960
Tell people your name again.

02:02:21.960 --> 02:02:23.120
Oh, my name is Hooks.

02:02:23.120 --> 02:02:24.680
I go by Hooks now.

02:02:24.680 --> 02:02:25.400
Wait, hold on.

02:02:25.400 --> 02:02:28.360
She also kicked the dick out of karaoke last night

02:02:28.360 --> 02:02:29.080
at the drawing room.

02:02:29.080 --> 02:02:31.320
You fucking murdered it.

02:02:31.320 --> 02:02:31.800
Well, then.

02:02:31.800 --> 02:02:33.720
Yeah, you came up and were vulnerable with us.

02:02:33.720 --> 02:02:37.040
And we, yeah, I mean, look, we don't

02:02:37.040 --> 02:02:39.640
claim to be the cure for anything, but.

02:02:39.640 --> 02:02:41.880
But especially since it's the week of Thanksgiving,

02:02:41.880 --> 02:02:44.360
just wanted to let y'all know Thanksgiving gets better.

02:02:44.360 --> 02:02:45.360
Yeah, that's when we met you.

02:02:45.360 --> 02:02:47.240
So you were thinking about going home to your family,

02:02:47.240 --> 02:02:47.680
and it was like.

02:02:47.680 --> 02:02:50.280
You gave me a shirt, and $80.

02:02:50.280 --> 02:02:52.800
And I gave $40 to some other dude that apparently

02:02:52.800 --> 02:02:53.920
was having a baby.

02:02:53.920 --> 02:02:55.720
But anyway, so yeah.

02:02:55.720 --> 02:02:57.360
Helping people is easy.

02:02:57.360 --> 02:02:58.160
Thank you.

02:02:58.160 --> 02:03:01.360
Also, here's my good buddy, Greg Papillon.

02:03:01.360 --> 02:03:02.480
Gregory Papillon.

02:03:02.480 --> 02:03:04.840
And he gave me ukulele strings and guitar strings.

02:03:04.840 --> 02:03:07.080
And this motherfucker is a bad dude.

02:03:07.080 --> 02:03:10.480
He's from Ontario, California.

02:03:10.480 --> 02:03:11.480
Whoa.

02:03:11.480 --> 02:03:13.480
Really?

02:03:13.480 --> 02:03:17.000
Consider that Saudi Arabia.

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:23.720
Greg, sum Harmontown up in five words or less.

02:03:23.720 --> 02:03:25.640
That's one.

02:03:25.640 --> 02:03:27.320
OK, here we go.

02:03:27.320 --> 02:03:28.240
OK, thank you very much.

02:03:28.240 --> 02:03:30.400
Gregory Papillon.

02:03:30.400 --> 02:03:34.600
I couldn't have said it better myself.

02:03:34.600 --> 02:03:35.800
What's your name, madam?

02:03:35.800 --> 02:03:36.400
Kristen.

02:03:36.400 --> 02:03:37.400
Kristen, where are you from?

02:03:37.400 --> 02:03:38.280
Hamilton, Ontario.

02:03:38.280 --> 02:03:40.160
Hamilton, the hammer.

02:03:40.160 --> 02:03:41.680
I've been to the hammer.

02:03:41.680 --> 02:03:42.640
I have a question for you.

02:03:42.640 --> 02:03:43.880
You're from Hamilton, Ontario.

02:03:43.880 --> 02:03:46.440
Why does everybody in Hamilton, Ontario have a limp?

02:03:46.440 --> 02:03:48.400
I've never seen more gamey legs.

02:03:48.400 --> 02:03:50.080
Everybody's fucking broken there.

02:03:50.080 --> 02:03:52.120
Everybody's in Hamilton.

02:03:52.120 --> 02:03:54.680
That's a bold statement.

02:03:54.680 --> 02:03:55.640
I say a high tone.

02:03:55.640 --> 02:03:58.960
Why does everybody in Hamilton got a limp?

02:03:58.960 --> 02:03:59.680
I wish you could be here.

02:03:59.680 --> 02:04:00.040
Oh, sorry.

02:04:00.040 --> 02:04:00.920
Where's Jesse?

02:04:00.920 --> 02:04:01.840
He's in Toronto.

02:04:01.840 --> 02:04:02.400
He's Toronto.

02:04:02.400 --> 02:04:03.400
Yeah.

02:04:03.400 --> 02:04:05.400
Well, we'll be in Toronto soon.

02:04:05.400 --> 02:04:17.280
OK, Steve, is our audience, are they autistic in general?

02:04:17.280 --> 02:04:18.080
They're awesome.

02:04:18.080 --> 02:04:20.480
They have autistic traits.

02:04:20.480 --> 02:04:21.520
A lot of people do.

02:04:21.520 --> 02:04:23.000
Yeah, they all do.

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:23.960
But they're awesome.

02:04:23.960 --> 02:04:24.520
Yeah.

02:04:24.520 --> 02:04:29.760
And Keith, everyone is chemical.

02:04:29.760 --> 02:04:30.240
Yeah.

02:04:30.240 --> 02:04:34.720
That's true.

02:04:34.720 --> 02:04:35.760
And you guys are happy.

02:04:35.760 --> 02:04:38.720
And I brought you out.

02:04:38.720 --> 02:04:41.760
I honestly, I told you guys backstage,

02:04:41.760 --> 02:04:44.560
there was no rhyme or reason to it.

02:04:44.560 --> 02:04:46.320
We've been doing this show for the whole decade.

02:04:46.320 --> 02:04:50.280
And it was truly a highlight to.

02:04:50.280 --> 02:04:50.760
Oh, we're.

02:04:50.760 --> 02:04:52.840
I wanted you guys to be here.

02:04:52.840 --> 02:04:54.960
And I really value you being here.

02:04:54.960 --> 02:04:55.480
Well, thank you.

02:04:55.480 --> 02:04:57.040
And I hope you had a good time.

02:04:57.040 --> 02:04:57.800
It was great.

02:04:57.800 --> 02:04:58.680
It was awesome.

02:04:58.680 --> 02:04:59.200
Absolutely.

02:04:59.200 --> 02:05:00.440
And thank you guys.

02:05:00.440 --> 02:05:03.000
Yeah, thank all of you.

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:04.520
We have one more show left.

02:05:04.520 --> 02:05:06.680
And this is the ultimate cliffhanger.

02:05:06.680 --> 02:05:09.480
But the last show is going to be the worst show.

02:05:09.480 --> 02:05:10.800
People are coming up here and going,

02:05:10.800 --> 02:05:12.360
I tried to get in the last show.

02:05:12.360 --> 02:05:13.800
I'm like, that's going to be the worst show.

02:05:13.800 --> 02:05:14.560
It's going to be the worst.

02:05:14.560 --> 02:05:15.440
The worst show.

02:05:15.440 --> 02:05:18.960
Yeah, because I'm just going to not even come.

02:05:18.960 --> 02:05:21.200
Because they're going to put chairs on the stage.

02:05:21.200 --> 02:05:22.480
It's going to be the worst show.

02:05:22.480 --> 02:05:23.440
This is the show that you want to be at.

02:05:23.440 --> 02:05:24.320
This is the best show.

02:05:24.320 --> 02:05:27.680
You came to the best one.

02:05:27.680 --> 02:05:29.800
This is the one.

02:05:29.800 --> 02:05:31.400
The last show is going to be garbage.

02:05:31.400 --> 02:05:34.480
Let's give it up for Keith and Steve, everybody.

02:05:34.480 --> 02:05:46.240
Rob Schrab, Spencer Crittenden, Will Ashland, Danny, Josh,

02:05:46.240 --> 02:05:51.360
Samson Riley, Austin, Sarah, everybody that came tonight.

02:05:51.360 --> 02:05:55.240
Church, Zach, Nolan, making everything happen.

02:05:55.240 --> 02:06:00.080
I'm your comptroller, Jeff Davis, your mayor, Dan Hyman.

02:06:00.080 --> 02:06:01.680
Oh, yeah.

02:06:01.680 --> 02:06:02.360
Oh, yeah.

02:06:02.360 --> 02:06:05.120
Steve Silverman and Keith Carricker, everybody.

02:06:05.120 --> 02:06:07.920
I really can't tell you how much you guys all mean to us.

02:06:07.920 --> 02:06:09.760
It's sad to see it go.

02:06:09.760 --> 02:06:13.680
But I'm so happy all you all traveled so far to come see us.

02:06:13.680 --> 02:06:15.160
Drive fast and take chances.

02:06:15.160 --> 02:06:35.880
Did you get any of that?

02:06:35.880 --> 02:06:45.560
It's a good show.
