patrol.\n\n04:06.460 --> 04:08.460\nHe didn't have to take a shit.\n\n04:08.460 --> 04:10.460\nThat would have never came out otherwise.\n\n04:10.460 --> 04:12.460\nWhat?\n\n04:12.460 --> 04:14.460\nNo one would...\n\n04:14.460 --> 04:16.460\nI have to fetch vodka every time I take a shit.\n\n04:16.460 --> 04:18.460\nOh.\n\n04:18.460 --> 04:20.460\nYeah, I don't have any notes.\n\n04:20.460 --> 04:22.460\nI think it just...\n\n04:22.460 --> 04:24.460\nWe're in the last leg of the podcast.\n\n04:24.460 --> 04:26.460\nI think it's important to note.\n\n04:26.460 --> 04:28.460\nI must have had a dream that I\n\n04:28.460 --> 04:30.460\nwrote down a note classic.\n\n04:30.460 --> 04:32.460\nBecause I remember today I was like,\n\n04:32.460 --> 04:34.460\nwell, I got that one note that I wrote.\n\n04:34.460 --> 04:36.460\nAnd that was like, in the dream,\n\n04:36.460 --> 04:38.460\nI was like, I got to talk about this in the podcast.\n\n04:38.460 --> 04:40.460\nIn my dream, I thumbed a note\n\n04:40.460 --> 04:42.460\ninto my notes app.\n\n04:42.460 --> 04:44.460\nAnd I was like, go talk about that.\n\n04:44.460 --> 04:46.460\nAnd it was in a dream.\n\n04:46.460 --> 04:48.460\nThe reality is,\n\n04:48.460 --> 04:50.460\nthis show is not worth\n\n04:50.460 --> 04:52.460\ncoming to.\n\n04:52.460 --> 04:54.460\nThat's the reality.\n\n04:54.460 --> 04:56.460\nBut in my dreams, it was.\n\n04:56.460 --> 04:58.460\nI dream about it.\n\n04:58.460 --> 05:00.460\nIt's affecting me.\n\n05:00.460 --> 05:02.460\nI wrote a note that I was eating a giant marshmallow.\n\n05:02.460 --> 05:04.460\nAll right, well, that's Jeff.\n\n05:06.460 --> 05:08.460\nI always have dreams where it's like,\n\n05:08.460 --> 05:10.460\nthe dream is just me standing in my room\n\n05:10.460 --> 05:12.460\nand I pull out my wallet and I place $5\n\n05:12.460 --> 05:14.460\ninto my wallet and I put it back in my pocket.\n\n05:14.460 --> 05:16.460\nAnd then I'm like, that wasn't a dream.\n\n05:16.460 --> 05:18.460\nIt was $5 and nope.\n\n05:18.460 --> 05:20.460\nThat's like, that was the podcast equivalent.\n\n05:20.460 --> 05:22.460\nThat's what you did.\n\n05:22.460 --> 05:24.460\nWhat are the ratio of dreams you have\n\n05:24.460 --> 05:26.460\nthat are like,\n\n05:26.460 --> 05:28.460\nbecause we have dreams where\n\n05:28.460 --> 05:30.460\nyou wake up from the dream\n\n05:30.460 --> 05:32.460\nand for a second you're like, that's real.\n\n05:32.460 --> 05:34.460\nAnd then you're like, oh, that's not real.\n\n05:34.460 --> 05:36.460\nWhat do you think the ratio is\n\n05:36.460 --> 05:38.460\nwhen that's good and what's bad?\n\n05:38.460 --> 05:40.460\n5%!\n\n05:40.460 --> 05:42.460\nOh.\n\n05:42.460 --> 05:44.460\nBecause sometimes it's good, sometimes it's bad, right?\n\n05:44.460 --> 05:46.460\n$50 when you wake up and you're like,\n\n05:46.460 --> 05:48.460\nI didn't find no $50.\n\n05:48.460 --> 05:50.460\nI'd say it's almost always bad.\n\n05:50.460 --> 05:52.460\nI feel like\n\n05:52.460 --> 05:54.460\nin the last couple of years\n\n05:54.460 --> 05:56.460\nevery time that's happened to me\n\n05:56.460 --> 05:58.460\nit's been exclusively good.\n\n05:58.460 --> 06:00.460\nLike, and maybe that's a privilege thing\n\n06:00.460 --> 06:02.460\nbecause I've excelled\n\n06:02.460 --> 06:04.460\nto a point where I'm like,\n\n06:04.460 --> 06:06.460\nmy dreams are now just about\n\n06:06.460 --> 06:08.460\nlike, my car's got\n\n06:08.460 --> 06:10.460\na flat tire and then I wake up and I'm like,\n\n06:10.460 --> 06:12.460\nno it doesn't.\n\n06:12.460 --> 06:14.460\nMy car was throwing up metal spaghetti.\n\n06:14.460 --> 06:16.460\nI had another dream\n\n06:16.460 --> 06:18.460\nwhere all my teeth were falling out,\n\n06:18.460 --> 06:20.460\none tooth fell out, then the other tooth fell out.\n\n06:20.460 --> 06:22.460\nThat means you're getting sick.\n\n06:22.460 --> 06:24.460\nYeah, I know, and I was.\n\n06:24.460 --> 06:26.460\nAnd the whole bottom row of my teeth\n\n06:26.460 --> 06:28.460\njust cracked off in one piece,\n\n06:28.460 --> 06:30.460\nlike a Dracula dentures.\n\n06:30.460 --> 06:32.460\nAnd then I was like, this is the worst thing\n\n06:32.460 --> 06:34.460\nthat's ever happened to me.\n\n06:34.460 --> 06:36.460\nAnd then I was like telling people about it\n\n06:36.460 --> 06:38.460\nand I was like, wait a second, I could talk perfectly.\n\n06:38.460 --> 06:40.460\nThis is a dream!\n\n06:40.460 --> 06:42.460\nBut how many dreams have you,\n\n06:42.460 --> 06:44.460\ncan you remember a dream where you,\n\n06:44.460 --> 06:46.460\nit was a great thing that was happening\n\n06:46.460 --> 06:48.460\nand then you woke up and you're like,\n\n06:48.460 --> 06:50.460\nI can't wait to get out of bed\n\n06:50.460 --> 06:52.460\nbecause that thing happened, no it didn't.\n\n06:52.460 --> 06:54.460\nYeah, one time I dreamed that I bought Pokemon Blue.\n\n06:54.460 --> 06:56.460\nPokemon Blue.\n\n06:56.460 --> 06:58.460\nI had a dream that Kyle McLaughlin\n\n06:58.460 --> 07:00.460\nwas a good friend of mine.\n\n07:00.460 --> 07:02.460\nAnd like,\n\n07:02.460 --> 07:04.460\nand I was like,\n\n07:04.460 --> 07:06.460\nbecause I met him at like this party\n\n07:06.460 --> 07:08.460\nand I was like, oh man I can't wait\n\n07:08.460 --> 07:10.460\nreally getting along.\n\n07:10.460 --> 07:12.460\nHe's like listening to me and laughing at all my jokes\n\n07:12.460 --> 07:14.460\nand I'm like, I can't wait to go home\n\n07:14.460 --> 07:16.460\nand tell Kate, hey, yeah.\n\n07:16.460 --> 07:18.460\nSomeone listen to me.\n\n07:18.460 --> 07:20.460\nYeah, it was a dream.\n\n07:22.460 --> 07:24.460\nAnd then I woke up and then I was like,\n\n07:24.460 --> 07:26.460\nI don't know no Kyle McLaughlin.\n\n07:28.460 --> 07:30.460\nI got all bummed out.\n\n07:30.460 --> 07:32.460\nWhen I was a little kid,\n\n07:32.460 --> 07:34.460\nI had a dream that I could fly\n\n07:34.460 --> 07:36.460\nand I was running around in my\n\n07:36.460 --> 07:38.460\ndriveway and it was like\n\n07:38.460 --> 07:40.460\nwe had a basketball hoop\n\n07:40.460 --> 07:42.460\nand I had a dream that if I\n\n07:42.460 --> 07:44.460\njust wanted to, I could fly.\n\n07:44.460 --> 07:46.460\nLike in like, not like\n\n07:46.460 --> 07:48.460\nSuperman like waiting in the sky, but I could just kind of\n\n07:48.460 --> 07:50.460\nhover around and just fly\n\n07:50.460 --> 07:52.460\nlike 20 feet off the ground.\n\n07:52.460 --> 07:54.460\nIt was an awesome, liberating dream.\n\n07:54.460 --> 07:56.460\nAnd I woke up, went out into the driveway\n\n07:56.460 --> 07:58.460\nand jumped in the air and believed\n\n07:58.460 --> 08:00.460\nI could fly and I guess what\n\n08:00.460 --> 08:02.460\ncouldn't fly.\n\n08:02.460 --> 08:04.460\nDamn.\n\n08:04.460 --> 08:06.460\nThat's what I had to flap my arms really hard.\n\n08:08.460 --> 08:10.460\nDid you ever dream that you could do that\n\n08:10.460 --> 08:12.460\nand then your arm extended?\n\n08:12.460 --> 08:14.460\nLike plastic man?\n\n08:14.460 --> 08:16.460\nNo, like Space Jam.\n\n08:18.460 --> 08:20.460\nBecause I mean it obviously brought me\n\n08:20.460 --> 08:22.460\nto R. Kelly when you said that.\n\n08:22.460 --> 08:24.460\nI believe I can fly. You literally believed\n\n08:24.460 --> 08:26.460\nyou could fly.\n\n08:26.460 --> 08:28.460\nI dreamt I could fly and I was young\n\n08:28.460 --> 08:30.460\nand naive enough to think that all you have to do\n\n08:30.460 --> 08:32.460\nis will yourself to fly.\n\n08:32.460 --> 08:34.460\nIt's amazing that you were young enough\n\n08:34.460 --> 08:36.460\nthat you retained that dream belief\n\n08:36.460 --> 08:38.460\nenough that you got out of bed\n\n08:38.460 --> 08:40.460\nand ran out there.\n\n08:40.460 --> 08:42.460\nThe moment I woke up, I went right out to where\n\n08:42.460 --> 08:44.460\nthe dream took place in the driveway\n\n08:44.460 --> 08:46.460\nand I just, I thought like\n\n08:46.460 --> 08:48.460\njust jump and believe in yourself.\n\n08:48.460 --> 08:50.460\nLike believe you can do it.\n\n08:50.460 --> 08:52.460\nAnd I jumped up and went smack\n\n08:52.460 --> 08:54.460\non the gravel.\n\n08:54.460 --> 08:56.460\nAnd I thought okay, that was a dream.\n\n08:56.460 --> 08:58.460\nThis is a harsh awakening\n\n08:58.460 --> 09:00.460\nabout the sadness of humanity.\n\n09:00.460 --> 09:02.460\nThe sorrow.\n\n09:02.460 --> 09:04.460\nI think the nice thing about our species,\n\n09:04.460 --> 09:06.460\nI think the key to our victory\n\n09:06.460 --> 09:08.460\nand inevitably to our demise\n\n09:08.460 --> 09:10.460\nobviously we're all dying\n\n09:10.460 --> 09:12.460\nbecause of our success.\n\n09:12.460 --> 09:14.460\nIt's a double-edged sword.\n\n09:14.460 --> 09:16.460\nIt's like humanity.\n\n09:16.460 --> 09:18.460\nYou did it. You're the most\n\n09:18.460 --> 09:20.460\npopulist mammal on the planet.\n\n09:20.460 --> 09:22.460\nTherefore, game over, you're dead.\n\n09:22.460 --> 09:24.460\nOr you're going to become matrix people\n\n09:24.460 --> 09:26.460\nin either case win-win for insects.\n\n09:26.460 --> 09:28.460\nI think Jellyfish and Lobster\n\n09:28.460 --> 09:30.460\nare a little...\n\n09:30.460 --> 09:32.460\nBut I think the romantic thing\n\n09:32.460 --> 09:34.460\nabout our species is, as pointed out\n\n09:34.460 --> 09:36.460\nin Yanov Shmirov, whatever that guy's name is,\n\n09:36.460 --> 09:38.460\nYako.\n\n09:38.460 --> 09:40.460\nNo, no.\n\n09:40.460 --> 09:42.460\nWhatever the Yanov Shmirov\n\n09:42.460 --> 09:44.460\nof the guy.\n\n09:44.460 --> 09:46.460\nThe guy I'm always quoting,\n\n09:46.460 --> 09:48.460\nhis anthropology book that I,\n\n09:48.460 --> 09:50.460\nthe Homo Deus guy.\n\n09:50.460 --> 09:52.460\nIt's like our dreams,\n\n09:52.460 --> 09:54.460\nHomo sapiens, our dreams\n\n09:54.460 --> 09:56.460\nare louder than reality.\n\n09:56.460 --> 09:58.460\nI'm just majoring journalism.\n\n09:58.460 --> 10:00.460\nThat's a fucking... Yeah, I've never looked it up.\n\n10:00.460 --> 10:02.460\nI'm going to be a journalism major.\n\n10:02.460 --> 10:04.460\nI believe in journalism.\n\n10:04.460 --> 10:06.460\nAnd then you can go to college for a semester\n\n10:06.460 --> 10:08.460\nand be like, journalism isn't real.\n\n10:08.460 --> 10:10.460\nAnd then you drop out.\n\n10:10.460 --> 10:12.460\nYou're like, what am I going to do?\n\n10:12.460 --> 10:14.460\nAnd then people would be like, why would you do that?\n\n10:14.460 --> 10:16.460\nWhy wouldn't you look up journalism?\n\n10:16.460 --> 10:18.460\nNot because I thought...\n\n10:18.460 --> 10:20.460\nI believed in it.\n\n10:20.460 --> 10:22.460\nI wonder how many journalists\n\n10:22.460 --> 10:24.460\nlobsters there are.\n\n10:24.460 --> 10:26.460\nYou hear about the Cybertruck.\n\n10:26.460 --> 10:28.460\nDo you have any thoughts on Cybertruck?\n\n10:28.460 --> 10:30.460\nWhat's your temperature\n\n10:30.460 --> 10:32.460\non Cybertruck?\n\n10:32.460 --> 10:34.460\nI love it.\n\n10:34.460 --> 10:36.460\nYou guys are going to talk shit about my best friend Elon Musk.\n\n10:36.460 --> 10:38.460\nNo, I'm just wondering.\n\n10:38.460 --> 10:40.460\nI love the Cybertruck.\n\n10:40.460 --> 10:42.460\nThe only thing I don't love about the Cybertruck...\n\n10:42.460 --> 10:44.460\nCybertruck.\n\n10:44.460 --> 10:46.460\nComing to your town.\n\n10:46.460 --> 10:48.460\nCybertruck.\n\n10:48.460 --> 10:50.460\nDriving you around.\n\n10:50.460 --> 10:52.460\nIt's got street lines\n\n10:52.460 --> 10:54.460\nSure, it's a Cybertruck\n\n10:54.460 --> 10:56.460\nGet some deal maker\n\n10:56.460 --> 10:58.460\nfor sure.\n\n10:58.460 --> 11:00.460\nI got one problem with the Cybertruck.\n\n11:00.460 --> 11:02.460\nOne!\n\n11:02.460 --> 11:04.460\nIt's for poor people.\n\n11:04.460 --> 11:06.460\nIt's clearly like the clean lines\n\n11:06.460 --> 11:08.460\nand all that.\n\n11:08.460 --> 11:10.460\nOh, it's not for poor people.\n\n11:10.460 --> 11:12.460\nIt's meant to protect rich people from the apocalypse.\n\n11:12.460 --> 11:14.460\nBut not from throwing\n\n11:14.460 --> 11:16.460\na brick at the window.\n\n11:16.460 --> 11:18.460\nNo, it's meant to...\n\n11:18.460 --> 11:20.460\nNo, it's got a really sensible price point.\n\n11:20.460 --> 11:22.460\nFor when the world ends\n\n11:22.460 --> 11:24.460\nand you have to go between your billionaire compound\n\n11:24.460 --> 11:26.460\nso you can just drive over people\n\n11:26.460 --> 11:28.460\nwith spears or whatever.\n\n11:28.460 --> 11:30.460\nAesthetically, that's what it presents.\n\n11:30.460 --> 11:32.460\nBut in reality,\n\n11:32.460 --> 11:34.460\nhe's eliminated\n\n11:34.460 --> 11:36.460\nthe big...\n\n11:36.460 --> 11:38.460\nbecause he caught so much shit\n\n11:38.460 --> 11:40.460\nfor I'm going to make my own car.\n\n11:40.460 --> 11:42.460\nPart of why it's hard to make a car\n\n11:42.460 --> 11:44.460\nis because engineers will tell you\n\n11:44.460 --> 11:46.460\nyou make humans feel safer\n\n11:46.460 --> 11:48.460\nby adding these weird Roman arches\n\n11:48.460 --> 11:50.460\nto the architecture\n\n11:50.460 --> 11:52.460\nwhich don't add to the safety of the car.\n\n11:52.460 --> 11:54.460\nBut if you just make those straight lines\n\n11:54.460 --> 11:56.460\nhe can make those cars even faster.\n\n11:56.460 --> 11:58.460\nThey're cheaper. That truck's going to be cheap.\n\n11:58.460 --> 12:00.460\nThat's what I read.\n\n12:00.460 --> 12:02.460\nIt's not super expensive yet.\n\n12:02.460 --> 12:04.460\nSpeaking of Wired Magazine,\n\n12:04.460 --> 12:06.460\nlet's bring out our guests.\n\n12:06.460 --> 12:08.460\nI brought these guys down from San Francisco\n\n12:08.460 --> 12:10.460\nbecause we're in the final leg of our podcast.\n\n12:10.460 --> 12:12.460\nThere's no rhyme or reason to it\n\n12:12.460 --> 12:14.460\nexcept that I love them.\n\n12:14.460 --> 12:16.460\nAnd the history of the show,\n\n12:16.460 --> 12:18.460\nusing decade that we've spent together,\n\n12:18.460 --> 12:20.460\none of the highlights was my ability\n\n12:20.460 --> 12:22.460\nto reach across the world\n\n12:22.460 --> 12:24.460\nhaving read a book and say,\n\n12:24.460 --> 12:26.460\nhey, come down to make a new friend.\n\n12:26.460 --> 12:28.460\nAnd I just wanted these guys\n\n12:28.460 --> 12:30.460\nto be here for the\n\n12:30.460 --> 12:32.460\nfor the end times\n\n12:32.460 --> 12:34.460\nand chat with us.\n\n12:34.460 --> 12:36.460\nIs that a good introduction, Dan?\n\n12:36.460 --> 12:38.460\nI don't know.\n\n12:38.460 --> 12:40.460\nLet's bring out...\n\n12:40.460 --> 12:42.460\nPlease welcome New York Times bestselling author...\n\n12:42.460 --> 12:44.460\nCybertruck.\n\n12:44.460 --> 12:46.460\nSteve Silverman and Keith Carrack.\n\n12:46.460 --> 12:48.460\nYeah!\n\n12:58.460 --> 13:00.460\nI had a dream that I was on the second\n\n13:00.460 --> 13:02.460\nto last Harmontown.\n\n13:02.460 --> 13:04.460\nThat was so heavy.\n\n13:04.460 --> 13:06.460\nThat dream is now a reality.\n\n13:06.460 --> 13:08.460\nThank you for running NeuroTribes,\n\n13:08.460 --> 13:10.460\nwhich everyone should go read.\n\n13:10.460 --> 13:12.460\nWe were talking in the green room\n\n13:12.460 --> 13:14.460\nabout diagnosis.\n\n13:14.460 --> 13:16.460\nSelf-diagnosis, diagnosis of others.\n\n13:16.460 --> 13:18.460\nWe were getting into me.\n\n13:18.460 --> 13:20.460\nYou were like,\n\n13:20.460 --> 13:22.460\nhas your mind changed about anything?\n\n13:22.460 --> 13:24.460\nI had to clarify\n\n13:24.460 --> 13:26.460\njust so everyone knows.\n\n13:26.460 --> 13:28.460\nI never diagnosed myself with autism.\n\n13:28.460 --> 13:30.460\nRight.\n\n13:30.460 --> 13:32.460\nAnd what I was talking about\n\n13:32.460 --> 13:34.460\nwas with some autistic people online\n\n13:34.460 --> 13:36.460\nand they were claiming\n\n13:36.460 --> 13:38.460\nthat you had diagnosed yourself with autism.\n\n13:38.460 --> 13:40.460\nAnd I said, well, I don't know about that.\n\n13:40.460 --> 13:42.460\nI don't think so, but whatever Dan is,\n\n13:42.460 --> 13:44.460\nhe's certainly neurodivergent.\n\n13:44.460 --> 13:46.460\nHe's fucking weird, right?\n\n13:46.460 --> 13:48.460\nHe's a weird guy.\n\n13:48.460 --> 13:50.460\nHe's fucking weird.\n\n13:50.460 --> 13:52.460\nThat was the important thing about your book.\n\n13:52.460 --> 13:54.460\nHe's a fucking weird guy.\n\n13:54.460 --> 13:56.460\nYeah, but the whole...\n\n13:56.460 --> 13:58.460\nStrange, right?\n\n13:58.460 --> 14:00.460\nYeah, but the whole thing is that it's a fucking weird people\n\n14:00.460 --> 14:02.460\nthat keeps society moving forward\n\n14:02.460 --> 14:04.460\nand not getting stuck in boring shit constantly.\n\n14:04.460 --> 14:06.460\nOkay, fine.\n\n14:06.460 --> 14:08.460\nYou're weird too.\n\n14:08.460 --> 14:10.460\nSteve,\n\n14:10.460 --> 14:12.460\nyou probably...\n\n14:12.460 --> 14:14.460\nYou don't think you're qualified or anybody's really qualified\n\n14:14.460 --> 14:16.460\nto diagnose other people.\n\n14:16.460 --> 14:18.460\nBut looking back through history,\n\n14:18.460 --> 14:20.460\nwe could probably diagnose certain people\n\n14:20.460 --> 14:22.460\nprobably with certain qualities.\n\n14:22.460 --> 14:24.460\nWell, the people who were retro-diagnosed,\n\n14:24.460 --> 14:26.460\nas they say in my book,\n\n14:26.460 --> 14:28.460\nthey were diagnosed by people\n\n14:28.460 --> 14:30.460\nwith actual qualifications to do so.\n\n14:30.460 --> 14:32.460\nSo I would never...\n\n14:32.460 --> 14:34.460\nBut looking at Dan,\n\n14:34.460 --> 14:36.460\njust look at him.\n\n14:36.460 --> 14:38.460\nJust to pick somebody at random.\n\n14:38.460 --> 14:40.460\nYeah.\n\n14:40.460 --> 14:42.460\nWhat is wrong with him?\n\n14:42.460 --> 14:44.460\nCan you help us?\n\n14:44.460 --> 14:46.460\nWell, we were talking about\n\n14:46.460 --> 14:48.460\nADD before,\n\n14:48.460 --> 14:50.460\nwhich seems right to me,\n\n14:50.460 --> 14:52.460\nbut I'm certainly not qualified to diagnose anybody,\n\n14:52.460 --> 14:54.460\nbut one gets a feeling.\n\n14:54.460 --> 14:56.460\nI resonated a lot\n\n14:56.460 --> 14:58.460\nwith the ADHD books that I've read\n\n14:58.460 --> 15:00.460\nslash listened to because who wants to\n\n15:00.460 --> 15:02.460\nfucking read these pieces of shit?\n\n15:02.460 --> 15:04.460\nI got better things to do, god damn it.\n\n15:04.460 --> 15:06.460\nBut the beauty is,\n\n15:06.460 --> 15:08.460\nif you have ADHD\n\n15:08.460 --> 15:10.460\nor whatever the fuck you have\n\n15:10.460 --> 15:12.460\nor don't have,\n\n15:12.460 --> 15:14.460\nwhat are the odds that science has come up\n\n15:14.460 --> 15:16.460\nwith ways to compartmentalize all of us?\n\n15:16.460 --> 15:18.460\nThe important thing about your book\n\n15:18.460 --> 15:20.460\nis that key phrase, neurodiversity.\n\n15:20.460 --> 15:22.460\nIt is the idea of like,\n\n15:22.460 --> 15:24.460\nhey, it takes a million kinds of brain\n\n15:24.460 --> 15:26.460\nto make a great society.\n\n15:26.460 --> 15:28.460\nAnd that America,\n\n15:28.460 --> 15:30.460\nnot to get jingoistic,\n\n15:30.460 --> 15:32.460\nbut it's like because it's probably\n\n15:32.460 --> 15:34.460\nthrough our,\n\n15:34.460 --> 15:36.460\nwe just didn't know how to stomp it out.\n\n15:36.460 --> 15:38.460\nBut like,\n\n15:38.460 --> 15:40.460\nwe created a country\n\n15:40.460 --> 15:42.460\nwhere if you can build it\n\n15:42.460 --> 15:44.460\nand it's worth money,\n\n15:44.460 --> 15:46.460\nyou now go from being\n\n15:46.460 --> 15:48.460\nmaybe the village idiot or the village geek\n\n15:48.460 --> 15:50.460\nor the village pervert to being\n\n15:50.460 --> 15:52.460\nlike the village count,\n\n15:52.460 --> 15:54.460\nthe village, you know,\n\n15:54.460 --> 15:56.460\nand if you read NeuroTribes,\n\n15:56.460 --> 15:58.460\nthere's a part of it that is like,\n\n15:58.460 --> 16:00.460\nthe history of America\n\n16:00.460 --> 16:02.460\nas it's\n\n16:02.460 --> 16:04.460\nundiagnosable relationship with autism\n\n16:04.460 --> 16:06.460\nand how always the people\n\n16:06.460 --> 16:08.460\non the fringe have been creating\n\n16:08.460 --> 16:10.460\nnew ways for us normies\n\n16:10.460 --> 16:12.460\nto communicate with each other.\n\n16:12.460 --> 16:14.460\nAnd us normies have messed up the world\n\n16:14.460 --> 16:16.460\nso badly that it might take somebody\n\n16:16.460 --> 16:18.460\nlike Greta Thunberg,\n\n16:18.460 --> 16:20.460\nwhose autism gives her the ability\n\n16:20.460 --> 16:22.460\nto not give a fuck\n\n16:22.460 --> 16:24.460\nabout the lying\n\n16:24.460 --> 16:26.460\nwhoever.\n\n16:26.460 --> 16:28.460\nThat's the cycle,\n\n16:28.460 --> 16:30.460\nis someone who's like geeky\n\n16:30.460 --> 16:32.460\nand like draws fire,\n\n16:32.460 --> 16:34.460\nstepping out front and going like,\n\n16:34.460 --> 16:36.460\nlook, I don't know\n\n16:36.460 --> 16:38.460\nhow you people are\n\n16:38.460 --> 16:40.460\napproaching this, but in my mind\n\n16:40.460 --> 16:42.460\nhere's how I approach it, and then\n\n16:42.460 --> 16:44.460\nyeah, we put them out there,\n\n16:44.460

school chemistry teacher.\n\n17:30.460 --> 17:32.460\nNo, I've moved up to high school.\n\n17:32.460 --> 17:34.460\nOh, really? Yeah, I did middle school for 10 years,\n\n17:34.460 --> 17:36.460\nbut...\n\n17:36.460 --> 17:38.460\nIs that how it works, our high school\n\n17:38.460 --> 17:40.460\nchemistry teachers?

Well, thanks for that\n\n18:18.460 --> 18:20.460\nthought.\n\n18:20.460 --> 18:22.460\nDo they still have chalkboards?\n\n18:22.460 --> 18:24.460\nYeah.

And if there's\n\n19:04.460 --> 19:06.460\na little chalk left, you could be like,\n\n19:06.460 --> 19:08.460\nI know that's going to make a lot.\n\n19:08.460 --> 19:10.460\nAnd you could come into Rick and Morty\n\n19:10.460 --> 19:12.460\na week later and be like, anyways,\n\n19:12.460 --> 19:14.460\nthis story is really important.

Absolutely.\n\n25:12.460 --> 25:14.460\nBecause I'm thinking, running a simulation\n\n25:14.460 --> 25:16.460\nof my high school self and\n\n25:16.460 --> 25:18.460\nimagining myself being in your class.\n\n25:18.460 --> 25:20.460\nAnd my first thought,\n\n25:20.460 --> 25:22.460\njust looking at you\n\n25:22.460 --> 25:24.460\nwithout knowing you at all,\n\n25:24.460 --> 25:26.460\nI would be like, don't fuck with this guy.\n\n25:26.460 --> 25:28.460\nOh, God, no.\n\n25:28.460 --> 25:30.460\nI don't think I've ever\n\n25:30.460 --> 25:32.460\ntaught a student who thought that about me.\n\n25:32.460 --> 25:34.460\nWell, I...\n\n25:34.460 --> 25:36.460\nI think it's more like...\n\n25:36.460 --> 25:38.460\nI don't mean don't fuck with him because he can kick my ass.\n\n25:38.460 --> 25:40.460\nI mean, don't get on this guy's bad side\n\n25:40.460 --> 25:42.460\nbecause he's actually like...\n\n25:42.460 --> 25:44.460\nHe's hardcore OG nerd.\n\n25:44.460 --> 25:46.460\nAnd like, he\n\n25:46.460 --> 25:48.460\nis going to pay huge\n\n25:48.460 --> 25:50.460\ndividends if you're...\n\n25:50.460 --> 25:52.460\nIf you give him a minimal\n\n25:52.460 --> 25:54.460\namount of attention.\n\n25:54.460 --> 25:56.460\nAnd he will leave you behind\n\n25:56.460 --> 25:58.460\nwith the smart kids\n\n25:58.460 --> 26:00.460\nif you fuck around.\n\n26:00.460 --> 26:02.460\nThat's a\n\n26:02.460 --> 26:04.460\nversion of hierarchy that I\n\n26:04.460 --> 26:06.460\nwould recognize. Keith gets really\n\n26:06.460 --> 26:08.460\nnice letters years later,\n\n26:08.460 --> 26:10.460\neven from students who thought his\n\n26:10.460 --> 26:12.460\nclass was too hard or whatever.\n\n26:12.460 --> 26:14.460\nLike, it makes\n\n26:14.460 --> 26:16.460\nyou cry sometimes, actually, to get\n\n26:16.460 --> 26:18.460\nreally nice letters. I cry about a lot of things.\n\n26:18.460 --> 26:20.460\nThat's true.\n\n26:20.460 --> 26:22.460\nI think in an American modern society\n\n26:22.460 --> 26:24.460\nabout the bow tie, Tucker Carlson\n\n26:24.460 --> 26:26.460\nnotwithstanding,\n\n26:26.460 --> 26:28.460\nthe bow tie is sort of like, hey,\n\n26:28.460 --> 26:30.460\nyou know what?\n\n26:30.460 --> 26:32.460\nFormal,\n\n26:32.460 --> 26:34.460\nbut only\n\n26:34.460 --> 26:36.460\nin the sense that\n\n26:36.460 --> 26:38.460\nI had to be.\n\n26:38.460 --> 26:40.460\nI can't put my finger on it.\n\n26:40.460 --> 26:42.460\nCan you tie?\n\n26:42.460 --> 26:44.460\nYou say you wear them all the time, right?\n\n26:44.460 --> 26:46.460\nDo you do it without looking or\n\n26:46.460 --> 26:48.460\ndo you have to have a mirror?\n\n26:48.460 --> 26:50.460\nI can't do it with looking. I have\n\n26:50.460 --> 26:52.460\nterrible spatial reasoning.\n\n26:52.460 --> 26:54.460\nLeft and right gets mixed up, so if I try\n\n26:54.460 --> 26:56.460\nto look in a mirror and do it, I\n\n26:56.460 --> 26:58.460\nstrangle myself.\n\n26:58.460 --> 27:00.460\nWould it be a bullshit thing for me to ask\n\n27:00.460 --> 27:02.460\nfor you to untie or bow tie and retie it?\n\n27:02.460 --> 27:04.460\nBecause\n\n27:04.460 --> 27:06.460\nI have to have a mirror to tie a bow tie.\n\n27:06.460 --> 27:08.460\nA lot of people have never seen a bow tie\n\n27:08.460 --> 27:10.460\nbe tied, including I'm speaking for myself.\n\n27:10.460 --> 27:12.460\nI should use my\n\n27:12.460 --> 27:14.460\neye statements. I have never seen a bow tie\n\n27:14.460 --> 27:16.460\nbe tied.\n\n27:16.460 --> 27:18.460\nWell, I'm so glad I could be here to do this\n\n27:18.460 --> 27:20.460\nthing.\n\n27:20.460 --> 27:22.460\nI will say a couple of great things about\n\n27:22.460 --> 27:24.460\nbow ties over neck ties.\n\n27:24.460 --> 27:26.460\nCan't\n\n27:26.460 --> 27:28.460\nspill on it.\n\n27:28.460 --> 27:30.460\nOh, okay.\n\n27:30.460 --> 27:32.460\nNever mind.\n\n27:32.460 --> 27:34.460\nNo.\n\n27:34.460 --> 27:36.460\nGet in it.\n\n27:36.460 --> 27:38.460\nThis is...\n\n27:40.460 --> 27:42.460\nI'm so not going to be able to do\n\n27:42.460 --> 27:44.460\nthis.\n\n27:44.460 --> 27:46.460\nI'm like, I'm seriously\n\n27:46.460 --> 27:48.460\nshaking.\n\n27:48.460 --> 27:50.460\nOh, well, that made it\n\n27:50.460 --> 27:52.460\nworse.\n\n27:54.460 --> 27:56.460\nThese people came from all over the world\n\n27:56.460 --> 28:02.460\nto watch you tie your bow tie.\n\n28:08.460 --> 28:10.460\nTie, tie, tie, tie, tie.\n\n28:10.460 --> 28:12.460\nTie.\n\n28:12.460 --> 28:14.460\nTie.\n\n28:20.460 --> 28:22.460\nYeah.\n\n28:22.460 --> 28:24.460\nYeah, baby.\n\n28:24.460 --> 28:34.280\nI would say, I would say, mic drop, that is so hard to do, I would say if you were ever\n\n28:34.280 --> 28:41.360\ndying in class, just untie your tie and do that, and then tell them all to sit down.\n\n28:41.360 --> 28:45.520\nI think Keith, that was the most show busy thing that's ever happened on our show.\n\n28:45.520 --> 28:46.520\nAwesome.\n\n28:46.520 --> 28:51.640\nAnd that's why I married him too, because can you imagine that dexterity put to other\n\n28:51.640 --> 28:52.640\nuses.\n\n28:52.640 --> 28:53.640\nUh-oh.\n\n28:53.640 --> 28:54.640\nUh-oh.\n\n28:54.640 --> 29:02.320\nI'm not sure exactly what you mean, but that sounds like a hand.\n\n29:02.320 --> 29:06.720\nThe English major's interpretation of the...\n\n29:06.720 --> 29:10.800\nI'll get it later.\n\n29:10.800 --> 29:15.280\nI hope you guys don't mind sharing the stage with maybe some pilgrims tonight, because\n\n29:15.280 --> 29:22.180\nthe show is ending, and so the audience is packed with people who have come, like the\n\n29:22.180 --> 29:27.200\nflung themselves from all four corners of the earth, and how many people came from another\n\n29:27.200 --> 29:28.200\ncountry tonight?\n\n29:28.200 --> 29:29.200\nYeah.\n\n29:29.200 --> 29:30.200\nThat's great.\n\n29:30.200 --> 29:31.200\nWow.\n\n29:31.200 --> 29:34.800\nHow many people came from like a long way away in the U.S. or Canada?\n\n29:34.800 --> 29:35.800\nYeah.\n\n29:35.800 --> 29:36.800\nWow.\n\n29:36.800 --> 29:38.800\nThat's a bit more believable.\n\n29:38.800 --> 29:41.800\nHow many people wore red tonight?\n\n29:41.800 --> 29:47.000\nHow many people can tie a bow tie without looking?\n\n29:47.000 --> 29:49.400\nOh, see, they're lying.\n\n29:49.400 --> 29:53.200\nBut the first person that comes to mind that I met at the drawing room, which I got in\n\n29:53.200 --> 29:57.560\nmy car from the Rick and Morty office, and I literally hit the wrong button on my Tesla\n\n29:57.560 --> 30:03.880\nscreen, and I ended up going to what was my old home, which is a couple blocks from the\n\n30:03.880 --> 30:05.680\ndrawing room, and I...\n\n30:05.680 --> 30:10.440\nSo I went into the drawing room for the first time in like six months, and it was just filled\n\n30:10.440 --> 30:11.440\nwith...\n\n30:11.440 --> 30:16.280\nI'm going to call it neurodiversity.\n\n30:16.280 --> 30:23.400\nAnd proudly so, and really passionate people, like people just thanking me for doing the\n\n30:23.400 --> 30:26.760\npodcast, being so respectful and amazing.\n\n30:26.760 --> 30:30.240\nAnd one of the most inspiring things, by the way, not to get off on a tangent, but was actually\n\n30:30.240 --> 30:33.440\nthe drawing room regulars, the people that...\n\n30:33.440 --> 30:39.360\nMy social anxiety was like, fuck, these people must hate me for fucking being a magnet for\n\n30:39.360 --> 30:41.760\noutside interlopers and all these things.\n\n30:41.760 --> 30:50.040\nBut some of the more working class elements of them were, because they talked to you guys,\n\n30:50.040 --> 30:59.240\nthey were at the end, they were going like, hey, man, talk to those people, and the shit\n\n30:59.240 --> 31:01.880\nthey say about you, fucking cheers, man.\n\n31:01.880 --> 31:06.600\nI was like, that's you guys, you're nice.\n\n31:06.600 --> 31:11.840\nYou sold me to these guys who... fuck them.\n\n31:11.840 --> 31:12.840\nThey're not here.\n\n31:12.840 --> 31:21.480\nBut anyways, thank you, and every single Harmontown fan as a matter of tradition, their introduction\n\n31:21.480 --> 31:22.480\nis always...\n\n31:22.480 --> 31:23.480\nI'm so sorry.\n\n31:23.480 --> 31:24.480\nI don't mean to interrupt you.\n\n31:24.480 --> 31:25.480\nI hate that you're...\n\n31:25.480 --> 31:29.480\nI'm doing this to you, but my name is so and so.\n\n31:29.480 --> 31:36.040\nThey come in so low, you almost want to punch them, but you don't, because you understand\n\n31:36.040 --> 31:40.120\nthat is exactly what I would do, that's exactly how I would feel, and so many of you came\n\n31:40.120 --> 31:41.760\nup to me tonight.\n\n31:41.760 --> 31:46.440\nOne of you in particular came up to me in the middle of my conversation with someone\n\n31:46.440 --> 31:51.400\nelse and just said, I'd like to talk to you about autism.\n\n31:51.400 --> 31:55.240\nThat was your introduction, and I said to that person, do you know who the guest is\n\n31:55.240 --> 31:56.240\ntonight?\n\n31:56.240 --> 31:57.440\nNo.\n\n31:57.440 --> 32:01.040\nIt's Steve Silberman, and they were like, oh my God.\n\n32:01.040 --> 32:08.680\nWell, let me tell you this, being Steve Silberman, I have a lot of autistic friends, and they\n\n32:08.680 --> 32:16.800\nthank you so much, particularly for Abed, because it gave them a person who they could\n\n32:16.800 --> 32:19.880\nreally relate to in visible media.\n\n32:19.880 --> 32:25.720\nI wrote a character based on my friend, almost punching Downish, like I was like, hey, my\n\n32:25.720 --> 32:34.560\nfunny friend, and then because I was narcissistic and hadn't been abused enough by online, I\n\n32:34.560 --> 32:42.480\nwas constantly googling myself and my show, and what I saw was this new thing called the\n\n32:42.480 --> 32:51.000\nautistic community saying, we love this Abed character, and I, because of greed and selfishness\n\n32:51.000 --> 32:57.320\nand desire to do a good job by these people, I was like, what do they mean?\n\n32:57.320 --> 32:58.520\nWhy do they like him?\n\n32:58.520 --> 33:01.800\nAnd they would say, he doesn't have Pinocchio syndrome.\n\n33:01.800 --> 33:05.800\nThey would say all these things, and it was like, oh my God, what is this thing?\n\n33:05.800 --> 33:06.800\nWhat's Pinocchio syndrome?\n\n33:06.800 --> 33:12.520\nWell, it's just this idea that if you're the data character on Star Trek, if you're these\n\n33:12.520 --> 33:13.520\ncharacters.\n\n33:13.520 --> 33:14.520\nI want to be a real boy.\n\n33:14.520 --> 33:15.520\nYeah.\n\n33:15.520 --> 33:20.000\nOh God, if only I could give someone a hug, then I'd be the greatest person ever.\n\n33:20.000 --> 33:26.000\nThat's like, I don't mean to put down hugs.\n\n33:26.000 --> 33:38.280\nWell, I don't mean, if that is someone's journey, I don't mean to diminish that, but there is\n\n33:38.280 --> 33:43.440\na very, very large community of people that are like, actually, this doesn't feel that\n\n33:43.440 --> 33:45.920\nmuch like a disability.\n\n33:45.920 --> 33:51.600\nI'm constantly watching you people give each other hugs, and then run away crying from\n\n33:51.600 --> 33:52.600\neach other.\n\n33:52.600 --> 33:54.280\nIt kind of all comes out in the wash.\n\n33:54.280 --> 34:00.720\nI basically am like behind this piece of plexiglass, which sometimes is an inconvenience, but overall\n\n34:00.720 --> 34:02.200\nseems to avoid a lot of trouble.\n\n34:02.200 --> 34:05.160\nI seem to be much more efficacious at my job.\n\n34:05.160 --> 34:10.280\nI don't understand why you people feel sorry for me and want to cure me of this plexiglass.\n\n34:10.280 --> 34:12.240\nThat seems a little stupid.\n\n34:12.240 --> 34:17.000\nAnd so they get a little annoyed, they see a character in a show that's kind of resonating\n\n34:17.000 --> 34:22.040\nwith them because they're like, I'm a robot, or I'm a puppet, or I'm a wooden clock, or\n\n34:22.040 --> 34:24.080\nI'm a fucking flying carpet.\n\n34:24.080 --> 34:26.480\nI'm looking at the carpet.\n\n34:26.480 --> 34:30.960\nThere's no such thing as a flying carpet that's like an autism thing.\n\n34:30.960 --> 34:31.960\nYou guys saw Aladdin?\n\n34:31.960 --> 34:34.960\nThat carpet's autistic.\n\n34:34.960 --> 34:39.120\nIt'll take you anywhere, but it doesn't care.\n\n34:39.120 --> 34:44.400\nBut I would watch them, and they would go like, I love Abed because he doesn't have\n\n34:44.400 --> 34:45.400\nPinocchio syndrome.\n\n34:45.400 --> 34:46.400\nHe doesn't do this.\n\n34:46.400 --> 34:47.400\nHe doesn't do that.\n\n34:47.400 --> 34:49.680\nAnd I was like, I want these people on my side.\n\n34:49.680 --> 34:51.680\nI want to do right by them.\n\n34:51.680 --> 34:58.840\nAnd then I took tests online because I wanted to learn the details of, like, I wanted to\n\n34:58.840 --> 35:02.320\nsend them signals, I'm on your side.\n\n35:02.320 --> 35:06.800\nI want to be like, if you were like writing Sons of Anarchy, like let me take a test about\n\n35:06.800 --> 35:12.160\nmotorcycles, like, oh, my handbrake gives me skin burns, or whatever, I'm like, whatever.\n\n35:12.160 --> 35:14.480\nGive me fucking money, cha-ching.\n\n35:14.480 --> 35:20.160\nI was only doing it through greed and narcissism, I was like, let me, I like this community.\n\n35:20.160 --> 35:22.160\nI want your approval.\n\n35:22.160 --> 35:26.480\nWell, you know, I went through the same thing while writing Neurotribes because I started\n\n35:26.480 --> 35:29.240\nwriting about autism as a science writer for Wired.\n\n35:29.240 --> 35:33.280\nBut as soon as I did a bunch of research, going all the way back through the Holocaust\n\n35:33.280 --> 35:36.320\nand everything, I realized, I like these people.\n\n35:36.320 --> 35:38.440\nThese people are on a journey towards autonomy.\n\n35:38.440 --> 35:40.400\nYou said the people that created America.\n\n35:40.400 --> 35:41.400\nRight, exactly.\n\n35:41.400 --> 35:43.600\nA journey towards autonomy?\n\n35:43.600 --> 35:44.600\nYou said?\n\n35:44.600 --> 35:45.600\nYes.\n\n35:45.600 --> 35:46.600\nExplain that to me.\n\n35:46.600 --> 35:50.800\nWhat I mean is autistic adults for most of the 20th century were like living and dying\n\n35:50.800 --> 35:52.440\nin institutions.\n\n35:52.440 --> 35:56.560\nSo and everybody was talking about autism behind their backs.\n\n35:56.560 --> 35:58.560\nSo I was like, oh, what causes autism?\n\n35:58.560 --> 36:01.800\nBelieve it or not, most autistic people don't wake up in the morning and say, I wonder what\n\n36:01.800 --> 36:03.520\ncaused my autism.\n\n36:03.520 --> 36:07.080\nYou know, they think about how they can have fun or how they can have friends or how they\n\n36:07.080 --> 36:10.760\ncan fall in love or how they can get a job or et cetera.\n\n36:10.760 --> 36:15.640\nAnd so I wanted to send them signals in my book that I was on their side too.\n\n36:15.640 --> 36:20.720\nAnd so that's why my book sort of took off with the blessing of the autistic community\n\n36:20.720 --> 36:22.280\nfor which I'm very, very grateful.\n\n36:22.280 --> 36:24.840\nYeah, it was super successful in that regard.\n\n36:24.840 --> 36:25.840\nYeah.\n\n36:25.840 --> 36:32.440\nAnd there are, anyways, but sorry, like I was describing this person who came up and said,\n\n36:32.440 --> 36:33.640\nI want to talk about autism.\n\n36:33.640 --> 36:35.920\nAnd she literally did not know that you were the guest tonight.\n\n36:35.920 --> 36:39.960\nAnd so I would be remiss of like, I think that we should bring her up.\n\n36:39.960 --> 36:45.360\nYes, I spoke to her before you did because I was at the drawing room earlier and she\n\n36:45.360 --> 36:50.040\nsaid like, I think it was her first episode where you were the guest and like, yeah, we\n\n36:50.040 --> 36:51.040\nhave to bring her up.\n\n36:51.040 --> 36:54.640\nI don't want to put too much pressure on her, but I also don't want her to live the rest\n\n36:54.640 --> 36:58.080\nof her life going like, I wanted to talk to him about autism and then the autism guy was\n\n36:58.080 --> 36:59.560\non the show, whatever.\n\n36:59.560 --> 37:01.240\nSo is it Jessica, right?\n\n37:01.240 --> 37:02.240\nJennifer.\n\n37:02.240 --> 37:03.240\nJennifer.\n\n37:03.240 --> 37:04.240\nJennifer is very close.\n\n37:04.240 --> 37:05.240\nCarrasquillo.\n\n37:05.240 --> 37:06.240\nAll right.\n\n37:06.240 --> 37:07.240\nJennifer Carrasquillo.\n\n37:07.240 --> 37:08.240\nAll right.\n\n37:08.240 --> 37:11.760\nBut really, Jessica, you go by Jessica mostly.\n\n37:11.760 --> 37:12.760\nWhoa.\n\n37:12.760 --> 37:13.760\nAwesome.\n\n37:23.760 --> 37:25.240\nThank you, Rob.\n\n37:25.240 --> 37:28.600\nNice, like James Bond kind of tuck and roll on the stage.\n\n37:28.600 --> 37:29.600\nThat was very good.\n\n37:29.600 --> 37:31.600\nThat was at Tobias Yunke.\n\n37:31.600 --> 37:37.600\nAll right.\n\n37:37.600 --> 37:39.600\nLet's talk about autism.\n\n37:39.600 --> 37:40.600\nNo pressure.\n\n37:40.600 --> 37:44.840\nJennifer, first off, you were a behavior specialist.\n\n37:44.840 --> 37:45.840\nWhat's it again?\n\n37:45.840 --> 37:46.840\nYeah.\n\n37:46.840 --> 37:47.840\nUse your microphone.\n\n37:47.840 --> 37:48.840\nWhat you said.\n\n37:48.840 --> 37:49.840\nWhat you said.\n\n37:49.840 --> 37:50.840\nWhat you said.\n\n37:50.840 --> 37:52.840\nSay it like the way that you know how to say it better than I do.\n\n37:52.840 --> 37:55.440\nI'll be your specialist.\n\n37:55.440 --> 37:56.440\nYeah.\n\n37:56.440 --> 37:57.440\nWoo.\n\n37:57.440 --> 37:59.800\nWhat does that mean?\n\n37:59.800 --> 38:05.160\nYou work for companies, corporations, and you deal with people, like break it down for\n\n38:05.160 --> 38:06.160\nme.\n\n38:06.160 --> 38:07.160\nI specialize in autism.\n\n38:07.160 --> 38:08.640\nI direct all the autism.\n\n38:08.640 --> 38:10.640\nI'm an autism director.\n\n38:10.640 --> 38:12.280\nUse the mic like a girl.\n\n38:12.280 --> 38:14.480\nWho are the people who you work with usually?\n\n38:14.480 --> 38:15.480\nNo.\n\n38:15.480 --> 38:16.480\nNo.\n\n38:16.480 --> 38:19.960\nI work primarily.\n\n38:19.960 --> 38:20.960\nUse your microphone.\n\n38:20.960 --> 38:29.280\nI work primarily with children on the autism spectrum from the ages of 0 to 11, or 11,\n\n38:29.280 --> 38:36.680\nand the services are pretty broad.\n\n38:36.680 --> 38:37.680\nIt's education.\n\n38:37.680 --> 38:38.680\nYeah.\n\n38:38.680 --> 38:47.400\nIf you could make a wish that would make the world better for the people you work with,\n\n38:47.400 --> 38:48.400\nwhat would it be?\n\n38:48.400 --> 38:49.400\nOh, that's a really good question.\n\n38:49.400 --> 38:50.400\nThat's a great question.\n\n38:50.400 --> 38:51.400\nIt's a fucking phenomenal question.\n\n38:51.400 --> 38:52.400\nThat's why I love him.\n\n38:52.400 --> 38:53.400\nOh, my God.\n\n38:53.400 --> 39:05.160\nIt would really be about creating not really so much the contrived environment from the\n\n39:05.160 --> 39:13.800\nages of the educational ages, but beyond that, and figuring out where people fit into society,\n\n39:13.800 --> 39:22.480\nbecause I think there's just so many expectations of us that we all have to fit into this different\n\n39:22.480 --> 39:23.480\nenvironment.\n\n39:23.480 --> 39:26.080\nI don't fucking know what I'm talking about.\n\n39:26.080 --> 39:27.080\nActually, no.\n\n39:27.080 --> 39:28.080\nYou were going to a good place.\n\n39:28.080 --> 39:29.080\nYou know what I mean?\n\n39:29.080 --> 39:40.480\nI feel like we're all channeled into these very specific ways that we go, and it's sometimes\n\n39:40.480 --> 39:48.600\nthe people that have the ability to contribute the most to these different areas are just\n\n39:48.600 --> 39:54.200\nkind of overlooked, and that's the cool thing about autism and services like what we do\n\n39:54.200 --> 39:59.280\nis we make sure that they don't get overlooked, and we make sure that these people that have\n\n39:59.280 --> 40:05.400\nthese incredible contributions to everything have a voice.\n\n40:05.400 --> 40:06.400\nThat's awesome.\n\n40:06.400 --> 40:07.400\nExcellent.\n\n40:07.400 --> 40:16.840\nThat's like a big theme of your book is the idea of accepting neurodiversity, and therefore\n\n40:16.840 --> 40:26.560\nthe way a society could react, it's basically building, it's going, oh, don't we all recognize\n\n40:26.560 --> 40:31.800\nthat all of our brains are like these crazy fireworks, and then therefore wouldn't an\n\n40:31.800 --> 40:41.720\nideal society allow for even the most fringe kind of conduits between the weirdest places\n\n40:41.720 --> 40:45.560\nof thought up into where they can provide people with help?\n\n40:45.560 --> 40:46.560\nThat's true.\n\n40:46.560 --> 40:51.640\nI think a lot of times stuff like art and comedy and science has been sort of unofficial\n\n40:51.640 --> 40:53.640\nchannels of that information.\n\n40:53.640 --> 40:54.640\nThat's it, yes.\n\n40:54.640 --> 40:55.640\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n40:55.640 --> 40:58.800\nYeah, comedy, TV, writing, all the arts, the sciences, the writing, I don't know how\n\n40:58.800 --> 40:59.800\nbroad you want to go.\n\n40:59.800 --> 41:02.800\nIt's like it's weird people going, can you hear me?\n\n41:02.800 --> 41:04.280\nDavid Lynch, hello.\n\n41:04.280 --> 41:05.280\nRight, exactly.\n\n41:05.280 --> 41:06.880\nI mean, Diak knows him.\n\n41:06.880 --> 41:13.840\nIt's like, David Lynch is, I was like not a fan until somebody said, he's autistic,\n\n41:13.840 --> 41:19.240\nand I'm like, I'm a fan, because then I look back at every David Lynch film that I was\n\n41:19.240 --> 41:24.680\nlike, come on already, and then I was like, oh, he's banging on a pipe and going like,\n\n41:24.680 --> 41:25.680\nhello?\n\n41:25.680 --> 41:29.040\nIt's me, David Lynch, can you hear me?\n\n41:29.040 --> 41:34.480\nOr for that matter, David Byrne, who's a show American Utopia, and I like Talking Hedge\n\n41:34.480 --> 41:35.480\nfinally.\n\n41:35.480 --> 41:42.400\nYeah, and the first time I saw him was in 1977, I'm really old, okay, Boomer.\n\n41:42.400 --> 41:45.560\nAt Oberlin.\n\n41:45.560 --> 41:49.080\nAnd the first time I saw him, I thought, why is that guy so nervous?\n\n41:49.080 --> 41:50.080\nHe's so nervous.\n\n41:50.080 --> 41:51.080\nDavid Byrne is autistic.\n\n41:51.080 --> 41:52.080\nHe's so nervous.\n\n41:52.080 --> 41:58.240\nYeah, he's autistic, or he has Asperger syndrome, which he talks about now.\n\n41:58.240 --> 42:04.240\nBut the amazing thing about American Utopia is totally uplifting, totally beautiful.\n\n42:04.240 --> 42:09.440\nEverybody playing music while they're dancing on stage, the antidote to a lot of what's\n\n42:09.440 --> 42:13.160\ngoing on in this country right now.\n\n42:13.160 --> 42:20.880\nIt was a very humanizing show, and that's coming from somebody with a neurodivergent\n\n42:20.880 --> 42:21.880\nmind.\n\n42:21.880 --> 42:22.880\nYeah.\n\n42:22.880 --> 42:24.960\nCan I take you to a weird, uncomfortable place?\n\n42:24.960 --> 42:28.280\nBecause I think the last time that we talked, maybe I was having dinner with you in San\n\n42:28.280 --> 42:34.720\nFrancisco with Cody, and I think maybe the election had just happened, and so we were\n\n42:34.720 --> 42:39.760\nlike hippies in San Francisco going like, okay, I guess the world's ending now.\n\n42:39.760 --> 42:40.760\nRight.\n\n42:40.760 --> 42:41.760\nAnd it did, by the way.\n\n42:41.760 --> 42:42.760\nIt did.\n\n42:42.760 --> 42:59.600\nBut now, I guess something that I have perceived as a tragedy is that whereas in the past,\n\n42:59.600 --> 43:04.240\nneurodiversity built the internet, neurodiversity gave us everything that we were using.\n\n43:04.240 --> 43:05.920\nSwipe left, swipe right.\n\n43:05.920 --> 43:07.560\nWho comes up with that?\n\n43:07.560 --> 43:10.880\nThe answer is, anyway, where are we all?\n\n43:10.880 --> 43:13.520\nWe're all moving in that direction.\n\n43:13.520 --> 43:19.960\nNow that the infrastructure has been in place, and all of society is on the internet to the\n\n43:19.960 --> 43:27.680\npoint where your presidents are chosen by the internet, my biggest frustration is my\n\n43:27.680 --> 43:31.440\nbrothers on the spectrum, and I'm not diagnosing myself.\n\n43:31.440 --> 43:40.320\nI'm saying my people, my neurodivergent people, by virtue of their Han Solo mentality, they're\n\n43:40.320 --> 43:49.520\nlike, I don't fucking like think like anybody, like those folks are now, whereas in the past\n\n43:49.520 --> 44:00.080\nthey were the builders of what we have, now they are simply sitting online, they're now,\n\n44:00.080 --> 44:10.080\nI watch them, the only way they can express their neurodivergence is by going, oh, butter\n\n44:10.080 --> 44:11.080\nemails.\n\n44:11.080 --> 44:12.080\nYeah.\n\n44:12.080 --> 44:22.200\nI'm like, dude, you don't, am I wrong about that?\n\n44:22.200 --> 44:29.360\nWell, I mean, there are always a lot of people watching television, but yeah, I mean, I know\n\n44:29.360 --> 44:30.360\nwhat you mean.\n\n44:30.360 --> 44:34.360\nI'm not going to take part in this system, like, oh yeah, that classically, yeah, your\n\n44:34.360 --> 44:38.080\npsychology has not taken part in any system, however, now the definition of not taking\n\n44:38.080 --> 44:42.560\npart in the system has now become part of this fucking death star, and I'm like, oh\n\n44:42.560 --> 44:49.360\nno, I was 25 once, oh fuck, and I just like, I recede to my swimming pool, I don't know.\n\n44:49.360 --> 44:54.720\nNo, I know, you know, in the early days of Wired when we were all in this one huge room\n\n44:54.720 --> 44:59.920\nwith dub music playing and everybody was high and had hickeys on their necks, we thought\n\n44:59.920 --> 45:05.640\nthe internet was going to absolutely unleash human creativity, and unfortunately what it\n\n45:05.640 --> 45:08.000\nunleashed was Russian propaganda.\n\n45:08.000 --> 45:13.840\nWe thought that the internet was like bound, everybody assumed that almost in a shameful\n\n45:13.840 --> 45:18.880\nway, I think we were all like, god damn, when's the government going to catch on to the fact\n\n45:18.880 --> 45:28.760\nthat once someone in Saudi Arabia can just sell you jewelry in Montana that everything,\n\n45:28.760 --> 45:33.320\nracism's going to stop, like, everything's going to stop, like, it's going to pull the\n\n45:33.320 --> 45:41.080\nplug on everything that's been driving human, like, jingoism, and I was like, it was the\n\n45:41.080 --> 45:48.200\nopposite, it was the opposite, we were like, oh, the internet made us more racist, wow.\n\n45:48.200 --> 45:50.200\nWell, not us, but yes, people.\n\n45:50.200 --> 45:52.200\nI may be more racist.\n\n45:52.200 --> 45:54.800\nDo you feel more racist?\n\n45:54.800 --> 45:59.480\nIt's certainly, you know what, it's made me a bigger fucking dick, it's made me more\n\n45:59.480 --> 46:05.040\nhateful, it's made me more divisive, it's made me go, there are good people and there\n\n46:05.040 --> 46:07.760\nare bad people, I never felt that way before.\n\n46:07.760 --> 46:13.400\nYeah, I agree with you, it's made me a worse Buddhist, because I have regular, sort of,\n\n46:13.400 --> 46:21.320\nentire iron fantasies involving certain… We spoke earlier, you and, like, over the\n\n46:21.320 --> 46:25.240\nlast few weeks, people were kind of coming to the two Harmontown because it's going\n\n46:25.240 --> 46:32.440\nto close soon, we meet a lot of people that talk about, like, why they listen to our weird,\n\n46:32.440 --> 46:38.760\nunprepared, stupid show, and it means a lot, it means different things to different people.\n\n46:38.760 --> 46:44.560\nWhat makes you as someone, you know, that's what you do, what draws you to it, and what\n\n46:44.560 --> 46:48.560\nmade you come out to go see it, because a lot of people came from, like, far and wide\n\n46:48.560 --> 46:53.200\nto come tonight, which is really, really cool and kind of blows my mind, like, what is it\n\n46:53.200 --> 46:59.400\nfor you personally that this did or does or didn't do?\n\n46:59.400 --> 47:03.760\nLike, what's your connection to this?\n\n47:03.760 --> 47:08.960\nI just don't really have a lot of personal connections overall, so it's…\n\n47:08.960 --> 47:09.960\nBoo!\n\n47:09.960 --> 47:10.960\nUnacceptable!\n\n47:10.960 --> 47:12.960\nI just ruin everything.\n\n47:12.960 --> 47:14.920\nI'm just going to leave.\n\n47:14.920 --> 47:16.920\nWhat's wrong with you?\n\n47:16.920 --> 47:23.080\nSo it's cool to just, yeah, it's cool to just, like, kind of get up and be able to\n\n47:23.080 --> 47:28.280\nsay whatever I have to say, and nobody really connects that to who I am or anything like\n\n47:28.280 --> 47:35.160\nthat, it's just, I don't know, this, you can just be who you are, it's this existential\n\n47:35.160 --> 47:39.480\nsort of thing where you can be wherever, and it's great, and you can do that with this\n\n47:39.480 --> 47:44.160\nwhole Harmontown thing, because Harmontown doesn't have a location and just is.\n\n47:44.160 --> 47:49.200\nSo it's kind of a community, and, God, that sounds so dumb.\n\n47:49.200 --> 47:50.200\nNo, it's good.\n\n47:50.200 --> 47:57.000\nBut it's cool, it's a community, and that's what, that's what I like about it.\n\n47:57.000 --> 48:04.120\nAnd I mean, so, yeah, that's it.\n\n48:04.120 --> 48:05.440\nI like the D&D.\n\n48:05.440 --> 48:07.440\nYou came for it.\n\n48:07.440 --> 48:11.120\nYeah, I like the D&D, too, that's cool.\n\n48:11.120 --> 48:12.120\nOh, no, no, I didn't.\n\n48:12.120 --> 48:13.120\nI was trying that.\n\n48:13.120 --> 48:16.120\nBut you came all the way from Pennsylvania.\n\n48:16.120 --> 48:19.680\nWe've met people that came from Vancouver, Japan.\n\n48:19.680 --> 48:20.680\nJapan?\n\n48:20.680 --> 48:21.680\nTexas, England.\n\n48:21.680 --> 48:28.560\nLike, I got the Japan, like, can we keep the carousel moving, and like, can we thank\n\n48:28.560 --> 48:29.560\nJen?\n\n48:29.560 --> 48:30.560\nThank you, Jennifer.\n\n48:30.560 --> 48:31.560\nThank you.\n\n48:31.560 --> 48:39.040\nI'm not good at, like, dismissing people, but it's, we got to cavalcade here.\n\n48:39.040 --> 48:40.040\nThank you, Jennifer.\n\n48:40.040 --> 48:41.040\nThat was awesome.\n\n48:41.040 --> 48:42.040\nI didn't have...\n\n48:42.040 --> 48:43.040\nYeah.\n\n48:43.040 --> 48:44.040\nYay!\n\n48:44.040 --> 48:46.440\nThere were other people.\n\n48:46.440 --> 48:47.440\nAwesome.\n\n48:47.440 --> 48:52.440\nWho, who, someone actually came from Japan?\n\n48:52.440 --> 48:53.440\nRight over here.\n\n48:53.440 --> 48:54.440\nWhoa.\n\n48:54.440 --> 48:55.440\nThat doesn't sound Japanese at all.\n\n48:55.440 --> 48:57.440\nLike, it sounds like he's from...\n\n48:57.440 --> 48:58.440\nIt sounds like...\n\n48:58.440 --> 48:59.440\nKanoka Park.\n\n48:59.440 --> 49:00.440\nWell, that's a...\n\n49:00.440 --> 49:03.440\nIt is me, but I'm not the person from Japan.\n\n49:03.440 --> 49:04.440\nIt's Ashlyn, right?\n\n49:04.440 --> 49:05.440\nOh, wow.\n\n49:05.440 --> 49:06.440\nYeah.\n\n49:06.440 --> 49:07.440\nAshlyn, you want to come up?\n\n49:07.440 --> 49:08.440\nAshlyn, bring it up.\n\n49:08.440 --> 49:09.440\nOh, wow.\n\n49:09.440 --> 49:10.440\nLittle kimono.\n\n49:10.440 --> 49:11.440\nI love it.\n\n49:11.440 --> 49:12.440\nWow.\n\n49:12.440 --> 49:13.440\nYeah.\n\n49:13.440 --> 49:17.440\nExcellent.\n\n49:17.440 --> 49:18.440\nHello.\n\n49:18.440 --> 49:19.440\nYo.\n\n49:19.440 --> 49:22.440\nThere you are.\n\n49:22.440 --> 49:23.440\nHoly smoke.\n\n49:23.440 --> 49:28.440\nI mean, for our non, like, video listeners, this is a great kimono.\n\n49:28.440 --> 49:30.440\nIt's the full rig.\n\n49:30.440 --> 49:31.440\nYeah.\n\n49:31.440 --> 49:32.440\nYeah.\n\n49:32.440 --> 49:34.440\nWith a rear-facing kabuki face.\n\n49:34.440 --> 49:37.440\nActually, this is a, it's a no-mask, which is a...\n\n49:37.440 --> 49:38.440\nNo.\n\n49:38.440 --> 49:41.440\nNo is like the predecessor of kabuki theater.\n\n49:41.440 --> 49:44.440\nIt's a classical Japanese form of theater.\n\n49:44.440 --> 49:45.440\nIt's almost intertwined.\n\n49:45.440 --> 49:47.440\nLike, it's almost like a...\n\n49:47.440 --> 49:50.440\nLike, Shintoism is the indigenous religion there.\n\n49:50.440 --> 49:51.440\nIt's animistic.\n\n49:51.440 --> 49:52.440\nAnd it's kind of like...\n\n49:52.440 --> 49:55.440\nIt's almost like a religious ceremony as much as it is a performance.\n\n49:55.440 --> 49:56.440\nIt's really boring.\n\n49:56.440 --> 50:00.440\nWait, so are you visiting from Japan or were you visiting Japan?\n\n50:00.440 --> 50:01.440\nNo, I live there.\n\n50:01.440 --> 50:02.440\nOkay.\n\n50:02.440 --> 50:03.440\nWhere do you live?\n\n50:03.440 --> 50:05.440\nI live outside of Osaka.\n\n50:05.440 --> 50:06.440\nOh, nice.\n\n50:06.440 --> 50:07.440\nYeah.\n\n50:07.440 --> 50:08.440\nI've been there for 11 years.\n\n50:08.440 --> 50:10.440\nI went there for a grad school.\n\n50:10.440 --> 50:11.440\nAnd I never came back.\n\n50:11.440 --> 50:12.440\nAre you fluent in Japanese?\n\n50:12.440 --> 50:13.440\nYes.\n\n50:13.440 --> 50:15.440\nThat means yes.\n\n50:15.440 --> 50:18.440\nI mean, I knew that one.\n\n50:18.440 --> 50:21.440\nI mean, I knew that one.\n\n50:21.440 --> 50:22.440\nCan I ask you a question?\n\n50:22.440 --> 50:23.440\nYeah, of course.\n\n50:23.440 --> 50:37.440\nWhat's your favorite really weird Japanese food that you can't get here?\n\n50:37.440 --> 50:38.440\nMice.\n\n50:38.440 --> 50:40.440\nIt's called...\n\n50:40.440 --> 50:42.440\nThat's a perpetuated stereotype.\n\n50:42.440 --> 50:44.440\nIt's called shirako.\n\n50:44.440 --> 50:48.440\nAnd it's like fish's testicles.\n\n50:48.440 --> 50:50.440\nBut they're inside the fish.\n\n50:50.440 --> 50:51.440\nSo it's like...\n\n50:51.440 --> 50:52.440\nYeah.\n\n50:52.440 --> 50:54.440\nAnd you can eat them raw or you can eat them cooked.\n\n50:54.440 --> 50:56.440\nAnd they're really tasty.\n\n50:56.440 --> 50:57.440\nShirako.\n\n50:57.440 --> 50:58.440\nCan't get them here.\n\n50:58.440 --> 50:59.440\nOh, yesume nasai.\n\n50:59.440 --> 51:01.440\nOh, yesume nasai.\n\n51:01.440 --> 51:03.440\nFish have testicles?\n\n51:03.440 --> 51:05.440\nThey're inside the body.\n\n51:05.440 --> 51:06.440\nWhat the fuck?\n\n51:06.440 --> 51:08.440\nAnd so...\n\n51:08.440 --> 51:11.440\nThat's why I'm not a life scientist.\n\n51:11.440 --> 51:12.440\nI'm a physical scientist.\n\n51:12.440 --> 51:15.440\nYeah, I don't want to know nothing about that.\n\n51:15.440 --> 51:17.440\nI would avoid that subject.\n\n51:17.440 --> 51:19.440\nHow does the stuff get out?\n\n51:19.440 --> 51:20.440\nNo, I won't know.\n\n51:20.440 --> 51:21.440\nI mean, yeah.\n\n51:21.440 --> 51:25.440\nLots of roe or like eggs as well are tasty.\n\n51:25.440 --> 51:28.440\nKazunoko herring roe is another favorite of mine.\n\n51:28.440 --> 51:30.440\nWhat is the thing on the back called?\n\n51:30.440 --> 51:33.440\nThe little pouchy business on the back?\n\n51:33.440 --> 51:34.440\nYeah, it's a little...\n\n51:34.440 --> 51:36.440\nI have always wondered like, what is the purpose of this?\n\n51:36.440 --> 51:38.440\nBecause you can't exactly put things in it.\n\n51:38.440 --> 51:41.440\nSo this is taiko or like drum obi.\n\n51:41.440 --> 51:49.440\nBut the obi is this long piece of material that you have to expertly weave around yourself.\n\n51:49.440 --> 51:52.440\nAnd so, yeah, what is the purpose of this thing?\n\n51:52.440 --> 51:59.440\nI've often thought, I think it's like to make you sit straight or something.\n\n51:59.440 --> 52:00.440\nInteresting.\n\n52:00.440 --> 52:01.440\nIt kind of looks cool.\n\n52:01.440 --> 52:08.440\nThe thing about Japanese kimono is like, the whole thing is like, you need straight lines.\n\n52:08.440 --> 52:17.440\nAnd I think that speaks to like the body type of the people who develop this tradition, right?\n\n52:17.440 --> 52:22.440\nSo like, in Europe you have the, I don't even know what era this would be, like Baroque,\n\n52:22.440 --> 52:28.440\nbut Victorian maybe, just tight waist and like voluptuous curves.\n\n52:28.440 --> 52:32.440\nThat's the total opposite of what you're going for with kimono.\n\n52:32.440 --> 52:37.440\nSo I actually have to like, I mean, I don't have big breasts, so that's not a problem.\n\n52:37.440 --> 52:41.440\nBut I put like, they have like a special pad that you put on your back\n\n52:41.440 --> 52:46.440\nand wrap your waist with a towel so that like, this line is straight.\n\n52:46.440 --> 52:49.440\nYou just want straight lines.\n\n52:49.440 --> 52:50.440\nEverything is straight.\n\n52:50.440 --> 52:52.440\nI love those.\n\n52:52.440 --> 52:54.440\nSome of my favorite lines are straight.\n\n52:54.440 --> 52:59.440\nIf anything, if anything's curvy, that's actually like a...\n\n52:59.440 --> 53:00.440\nWell, it's just not the style.\n\n53:00.440 --> 53:01.440\nYeah, I don't know.\n\n53:01.440 --> 53:06.440\nWell, they don't, I mean, they don't really have like curves so much as maybe your friends.\n\n53:06.440 --> 53:08.440\nI'm tripping out on the face and the back of my head.\n\n53:08.440 --> 53:10.440\nI know, me too.\n\n53:10.440 --> 53:12.440\nYou're kind of never of duty.\n\n53:12.440 --> 53:13.440\nYeah, I know.\n\n53:13.440 --> 53:16.440\nIs the word kimono...\n\n53:16.440 --> 53:17.440\nKimono.\n\n53:17.440 --> 53:21.440\nIs that referencing a whole style or just the garment?\n\n53:21.440 --> 53:25.440\nKimono, ki means wear and mono means thing.\n\n53:25.440 --> 53:27.440\nSo it's just things you wear.\n\n53:27.440 --> 53:29.440\nSo it is like a, it's a style.\n\n53:29.440 --> 53:31.440\nIt's like lakosenostri, this thing of ours.\n\n53:31.440 --> 53:33.440\nIt's just garments.\n\n53:33.440 --> 53:34.440\nIt's just garments.\n\n53:34.440 --> 53:37.440\nYeah, but I mean, it is a certain style of garment.\n\n53:37.440 --> 53:41.440\nNow, do you rock a kimono just around town or is this a special offense?\n\n53:41.440 --> 53:42.440\nSometimes.\n\n53:42.440 --> 53:44.440\nWell, this, I mean, this is special.\n\n53:44.440 --> 53:47.440\nBut yeah, I do wear kimono sometimes around town.\n\n53:47.440 --> 53:51.440\nSo you're visiting from Japan and you're going back home soon?\n\n53:51.440 --> 53:53.440\nYeah, in a week.\n\n53:53.440 --> 53:55.440\nHome is Osaka for you, or outside of Osaka?\n\n53:55.440 --> 53:56.440\nYes, yeah.\n\n53:56.440 --> 53:57.440\nThat's awesome.\n\n53:57.440 --> 53:58.440\nYeah, I came here.\n\n53:58.440 --> 54:05.440\nOkay, so you came up to me at the drawing room and you gave me a folded piece of paper and you said there's a story.\n\n54:05.440 --> 54:06.440\nYeah, there's a story.\n\n54:06.440 --> 54:07.440\nOrigami.\n\n54:07.440 --> 54:09.440\nI know, I know.\n\n54:09.440 --> 54:11.440\nPretty entry level.\n\n54:11.440 --> 54:12.440\nI know.\n\n54:12.440 --> 54:14.440\nI do origami.\n\n54:14.440 --> 54:16.440\nI know it's just that, yeah.\n\n54:16.440 --> 54:18.440\nI made a floor.\n\n54:18.440 --> 54:20.440\nA tatami.\n\n54:20.440 --> 54:21.440\nOr a wall.\n\n54:21.440 --> 54:23.440\nSo that was just, that was a copy.\n\n54:23.440 --> 54:24.440\nRight.\n\n54:24.440 --> 54:25.440\nI brought my own.\n\n54:25.440 --> 54:26.440\nYou said you had a story.\n\n54:26.440 --> 54:27.440\nYes, I have a story to tell.\n\n54:27.440 --> 54:29.440\nThat got no applause.\n\n54:29.440 --> 54:33.440\nYou whipped that out with such style.\n\n54:33.440 --> 54:39.440\nSo this is a story of why I came here and what Harmontown means to me.\n\n54:39.440 --> 54:45.440\nI want to read part of it, but to set it up.\n\n54:45.440 --> 54:46.440\nCool.\n\n54:46.440 --> 54:47.440\nFor camera.\n\n54:47.440 --> 54:48.440\nIt's better if you set it.\n\n54:48.440 --> 54:49.440\nNo, I'm good.\n\n54:49.440 --> 54:51.440\nI kind of want to act out part of it.\n\n54:51.440 --> 54:54.440\nI was proud of my tie about a half hour ago.\n\n54:54.440 --> 54:57.440\nYou've done fantastic.\n\n54:57.440 --> 55:02.440\nI'm going to like lavish you.\n\n55:02.440 --> 55:06.440\nI'll bring you down, but bring you back up in the end.\n\n55:06.440 --> 55:11.440\nThis, so I was really depressed.\n\n55:11.440 --> 55:16.440\nLike this was only a couple of months ago, maybe two and a half or so.\n\n55:16.440 --> 55:20.440\nAnd yeah, I'd like, it was over the course of six months that it just got worse and worse.\n\n55:20.440 --> 55:24.440\nAnd then like I downward spiraled at the end there and I couldn't, I mean, I just didn't\n\n55:24.440 --> 55:25.440\nwant to be awake.\n\n55:25.440 --> 55:31.440\nAnd I was listening to this podcast, like just waking up and listening to it just to,\n\n55:31.440 --> 55:33.440\nthat was my lifeline.\n\n55:33.440 --> 55:35.440\nSo that's the context.\n\n55:35.440 --> 55:40.440\nWell, actually, okay.\n\n55:40.440 --> 55:46.440\nAnd leading up to that, I named you Will Drosten.\n\n55:46.440 --> 55:49.440\nIs that okay?\n\n55:49.440 --> 55:52.440\nWill Drosten.\n\n55:52.440 --> 56:01.440\nTo protect my identity.\n\n56:01.440 --> 56:05.440\nOr you're going from here to Doug Benson's podcast.\n\n56:05.440 --> 56:10.440\nI named you Will Drosten and he's like, that's great, I'm high.\n\n56:10.440 --> 56:13.440\nAnd then you're off to Joe Rogan and you're like, I named you Will Drosten and he's like,\n\n56:13.440 --> 56:18.440\nhave you tried DMT?\n\n56:18.440 --> 56:26.440\nI found Will Drosten on Hey Ho Kool-Aid, which is also a made up name of a podcast that,\n\n56:26.440 --> 56:35.440\nokay, I had never heard of him before.\n\n56:35.440 --> 56:36.440\nExcuse me.\n\n56:36.440 --> 56:40.440\nI started the episode in the car after dropping my friend off on the opposite side of the city.\n\n56:40.440 --> 56:45.440\nI was fumbling with the controls while getting lost in a maze of basket woven overpasses and\n\n56:45.440 --> 56:48.440\ntunnels, trying to rewind.\n\n56:48.440 --> 56:51.440\nI had to concentrate to follow what he was saying.\n\n56:51.440 --> 56:56.440\nAnd it wasn't because he was intentionally obfuscating to trick his interlocutors into assuming he is\n\n56:56.440 --> 56:58.440\nintellectually superior.\n\n56:58.440 --> 57:02.440\nLots of people would call him a creative genius, a term that gets bandied about,\n\n57:02.440 --> 57:04.440\nespecially in Hollywood.\n\n57:04.440 --> 57:08.440\nSome people hate his guts, but I can't imagine that gets to him.\n\n57:08.440 --> 57:13.440\nHe who describes himself as a fat, stupid piece of shit.\n\n57:13.440 --> 57:23.440\nMaybe he is.\n\n57:23.440 --> 57:29.440\nA nerd, an entertainer, a solipsist, a pariah, an exemplar of redemption, a pariah once\n\n57:29.440 --> 57:35.440\nmore and once more redeemed, endlessly cycling along the curved quadrants of a four act narrative\n\n57:35.440 --> 57:40.440\nwhose structure he believes is so deeply etched into our cognitive apparatuses, his tongue\n\n57:40.440 --> 57:46.440\nand cheek cameo on an episode of The Simpsons to pick him drawing the circle on a whiteboard.\n\n57:46.440 --> 57:52.440\nHe doesn't claim to have discovered it, only to have successfully harnessed it to make a lot of money.\n\n57:52.440 --> 58:00.440\nHis was a particularly delicious swirl of intricately web thoughts spun through articulatory prowess\n\n58:00.440 --> 58:04.440\nand above all an unabashed, unadulterated self-loathing.\n\n58:04.440 --> 58:11.440\nHe didn't try to gloss over his twistedness, his fetishes, his alcohol and drug consumption, or ironically his shame.\n\n58:11.440 --> 58:16.440\nHe knew where his faults lie and rather than deny them, he called them out in the loudest voice possible.\n\n58:16.440 --> 58:20.440\nIt felt so good to watch someone do that. It was healing.\n\n58:20.440 --> 58:26.440\nI listened to that podcast like medicine, skating the razor's edge of self-righteousness and masochistic humility.\n\n58:26.440 --> 58:31.440\nI loved how they played on stage. I want friends to play with like that.\n\n58:31.440 --> 58:37.440\nI thought a drift in an ocean of empty beer cans and unwashed dishes.\n\n58:37.440 --> 58:43.440\nIt's not done! It's not done!\n\n58:43.440 --> 58:48.440\nChapter two.\n\n58:48.440 --> 58:56.440\nSo, I had this dream where I met you\n\n58:56.440 --> 59:02.440\nand we were partners, not necessarily in a romantic way.\n\n59:02.440 --> 59:05.440\nBusiness partners. We don't get to play together.\n\n59:05.440 --> 59:13.440\nWe were friends and at the end of our misadventures we end up on opposite sides of the street.\n\n59:13.440 --> 59:18.440\nWe're like in our own houses on opposite sides of the street and we're talking on the landline\n\n59:18.440 --> 59:23.440\nand you've got a bunch of creatures and characters in the room with you and I'm alone over here\n\n59:23.440 --> 59:29.440\nbut we're laughing and joking and I look out the window and notice that you've left your suitcase\n\n59:29.440 --> 59:36.440\non the front porch with the door wide open and so I tried to like weave that into our banter\n\n59:36.440 --> 59:42.440\nbut it didn't track so I said I'm going to come over and tell you a secret and you were like oh my god\n\n59:42.440 --> 59:48.440\nand so you came outside and you were kind of surprised when I just walked past you\n\n59:48.440 --> 59:53.440\nmaybe like ruffled your hair, put the suitcase inside, closed the door\n\n59:53.440 --> 59:59.440\nand I walked back over to you and...\n\n59:59.440 --> 01:00:04.440\nChapter three.\n\n01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:12.440\nI kissed the top of your head and at that moment I am instantly and utterly overwhelmed\n\n01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:19.440\nby the most intense feelings of gratitude, compassion, love and its myriad forms, the entire fucking universe.\n\n01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:25.440\nBoom! A bolt of lightning cracks and I wake up.\n\n01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:31.440\nThere's a thunderstorm passing outside, tears stream down my face as I blissfully bathe\n\n01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:36.440\nand the sensory ups and salts of having been seen, been held and understood.\n\n01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:42.440\nI lie there for a few moments, the bath bubbles are popping, the tub water is draining.\n\n01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:48.440\nI move to get up but something gently urges, just enjoy these moments, they will be over soon enough.\n\n01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:58.440\nI sit on the edge of my bed, open the door and listen to the rain, still awash with the feeling of having spent intimate time with someone whom I adore and admire\n\n01:00:58.440 --> 01:01:02.440\nbut we're strangers, right? What was that bolt of lightning?\n\n01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:06.440\nWhat about the rising sun streaming perfectly through that embrasure?\n\n01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:10.440\nWhat about that repeated topic of conversation? What about that stranger?\n\n01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:15.440\nWhy are you connecting dots if there is no benevolent force assigning them ordered numbers?\n\n01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:22.440\nHow can these be assembled to form a picture in a universe that doesn't deign to move you in any particular direction?\n\n01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:31.440\nWhat hit next collided with another bolt of lightning that cracked so loud and near my window that I jumped up and turned around.\n\n01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:38.440\nHeart pounding, half expecting someone to walk through the door.\n\n01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:45.440\nThe benevolent force is you.\n\n01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:48.440\nIt's you, it's you, it's you, it's you.\n\n01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:57.440\nIf you choose benevolence, you are the engine of the force field that is blasting through the architecture of your consciousness and all of its contents.\n\n01:01:57.440 --> 01:02:02.440\nYou are God.\n\n01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:07.440\nAlright.\n\n01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:11.440\nThank you, Ashlyn. Absolutely beautiful. Ashlyn, everybody.\n\n01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:15.440\nYeah, that's incredible.\n\n01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:18.440\nThank you so much.\n\n01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:25.440\nI mean, you don't, like, we started doing this podcast like you don't, like, remember Adam Goldberg?\n\n01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:28.440\nYeah, sounds like he's here.\n\n01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:31.440\nIf you say his name three times, he'll appear on stage.\n\n01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:35.440\nThe first thing was like, do you, is this a safe place?\n\n01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:41.440\nAnd if it is, do you bully anybody? Do you shut anybody out?\n\n01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:45.440\nThat was such gorgeous prose.\n\n01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:54.440\nAnd I could go on about how it should not be applied to me, but that's not what's important.\n\n01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:58.440\nThe prose kind of included that. The o-rings were in place there.\n\n01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:06.440\nShe was able to create an expression of like, oh, this rubber ring could connect to anybody, really.\n\n01:03:06.440 --> 01:03:11.440\nThat's so flattering, so beautiful.\n\n01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:18.440\nWhat blows my mind is that people, for some reason, are like, how long, seven years we've been doing this?\n\n01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:27.440\nNo, I think, God, it's a million. And paste.commagazine.org.edu.\n\n01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:35.440\nSomebody said we're one of the top ten podcasts of the decade, which I didn't realize was like, we're nearing the end of a decade.\n\n01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:38.440\nTop 30.\n\n01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:40.440\nTop 30.\n\n01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:43.440\nYeah, I was gonna say.\n\n01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:45.440\nI wish. Don't get me wrong.\n\n01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:48.440\nWe were number 21 out of 30, I think.\n\n01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:50.440\nAlright, fine.\n\n01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:54.440\nI guess somebody polished that knob for me.\n\n01:03:54.440 --> 01:03:56.440\nWe might have been in the top ten.\n\n01:03:56.440 --> 01:03:58.440\nI thought it was one of the top ten.\n\n01:03:58.440 --> 01:04:10.440\nOver the last couple of days, people have been coming, strange pilgrimage to the drawing room to say hi and go to the show and meet up with other Harmontown fans.\n\n01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:15.440\nIt's really crazy. You guys came from everywhere. It's amazing.\n\n01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:20.440\nHas anybody not been to Los Angeles before tonight?\n\n01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:22.440\nMost of them.\n\n01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:23.440\nThat's awesome.\n\n01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:28.440\nI met Sarah and Austin. You guys are from Chicago.\n\n01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:31.440\nMy dad went there for school.\n\n01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:36.440\nThere's Jennifer from Pennsylvania.\n\n01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:38.440\nSamson and Riley from where?\n\n01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:41.440\nOkay, well, what's your name from Vancouver?\n\n01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:44.440\nWhat's your name, buddy, from Vancouver?\n\n01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:45.440\nSamson and Riley.\n\n01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:47.440\nDanny from Vancouver.\n\n01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:49.440\nOh, shit.\n\n01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:52.440\nBecause I met him at the drawing room and he...\n\n01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:54.440\nBring it up.\n\n01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:56.440\nWhere's he at?\n\n01:04:56.440 --> 01:05:01.440\nWhat he said, Danny from Vancouver...\n\n01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:02.440\nDanny.\n\n01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:08.440\nI put a lot of pressure on you, but what you said was you've been working on a Dan Harmon.impression.\n\n01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:11.440\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:19.440\nThat was one word long and you had it about 30% of the way.\n\n01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:21.440\nI was like, all right, come up and share it.\n\n01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:24.440\nYeah, it's a sound and a word.\n\n01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:27.440\nSorry to expand upon, but I promised you.\n\n01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:29.440\nThis is a bait and switch.\n\n01:05:29.440 --> 01:05:31.440\nI feel comfortable.\n\n01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:36.440\nAs we near the end of me being a public figure, I'm like, honestly,\n\n01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:43.440\nI would have loved to have seen a lot more impressions of me from the James Adomians of the world.\n\n01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:47.440\nI've solicited it, so whatever you can give me, I love it.\n\n01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:48.440\nYeah, I tried.\n\n01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:51.440\nMy friend Samson put me onto your podcast about nine months ago.\n\n01:05:51.440 --> 01:06:00.440\nI started binge listening and there was just one word that I picked up on that I thought quintessentialized Dan Harmon\n\n01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:03.440\nand maybe I could possibly imitate you on.\n\n01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:05.440\nSo I need Jeff's help.\n\n01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:13.440\nI just need you to end sort of a non sequitur, an irritating story that Dan would find.\n\n01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:20.440\nJust something that, you know, whether you mean fucking or just anything sort of like end of a story.\n\n01:06:20.440 --> 01:06:21.440\nAnd then I'll, yeah.\n\n01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:27.440\nAnd the major D turned to me and said, thank you.\n\n01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:39.440\nAll right.\n\n01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:43.440\nDanny from Vancouver.\n\n01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:51.440\nDanny everybody.\n\n01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:53.440\nYou better get out of here, Danny.\n\n01:06:53.440 --> 01:07:03.440\nAll right, thank you.

01:08:33.440\nIt's got like a neon sign out front.\n\n01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:34.440\nI don't know.\n\n01:08:34.440 --> 01:08:35.440\nI'll take you somewhere better.\n\n01:08:35.440 -->

--> 01:08:45.440\nwho's from somewhere else?\n\n01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:48.440\nAnd he was like, San Antonio, you're like, come up here.\n\n01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:49.440\nRight.\n\n01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:53.440\nSo, like, I'm on his side if anyone's like, boo,\n\n01:08:53.440 --> 01:08:55.440\nbecause he didn't ask for this.\n\n01:08:55.440 --> 01:08:56.440\nThey didn't ask for it.\n\n01:08:56.440 --> 01:08:58.440\nHe yelled out, it's my birthday.\n\n01:08:58.440 --> 01:08:59.440\nI did.\n\n01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:00.440\nI totally voted for this.\n\n01:09:00.440 --> 01:09:01.440\nAlright, so it's not, and it's not.\n\n01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:02.440\nThat's not.\n\n01:09:02.440 --> 01:09:07.440\nBut, right, now, let's get to work.\n\n01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:12.440\nYou think you're, you think maybe you're autistic or,\n\n01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:17.440\ndid you write a beautiful letter about like the fucking nature of my soul?\n\n01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:21.440\nWhere's your fucking kimono first off?\n\n01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:23.440\nI could recite some poetry.\n\n01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:27.440\nThe community is like hands down my favorite show on behalf of everyone who loves it.\n\n01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:31.440\nThank you very much for making that.\n\n01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:34.440\nI've seen it about 500 times from beginning to end,\n\n01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:36.440\nand I think that has something to do with autism.\n\n01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:39.440\nI know they're finding comfort in the repetition.\n\n01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:43.440\nAnd it, you know, as someone who also doesn't have a whole lot of friends,\n\n01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:46.440\nlike this show does, it gives you that sense of community.\n\n01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:49.440\nI think it's one of Maslow's hierarchy of, you know,\n\n01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:51.440\nself-realization that you...\n\n01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:53.440\nContinue.\n\n01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:54.440\nYeah, you...\n\n01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:59.440\nWell, Maslow had nine other hierarchies that are less publicized,\n\n01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:01.440\nand for good reason.\n\n01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:05.440\nMaslow's hierarchy of crushing posts.\n\n01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:09.440\nWhich was a best-selling book.\n\n01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:11.440\nIt was like, there were like nine...\n\n01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:14.440\nHe had a hierarchy of surfing.\n\n01:10:14.440 --> 01:10:20.440\nA hierarchy of a red cabbage diet.\n\n01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:21.440\nAlright, sorry.\n\n01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:22.440\nI can't riff.\n\n01:10:22.440 --> 01:10:24.440\nGo to the carpet again.\n\n01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:26.440\nA sense of community.\n\n01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:28.440\nMaslow's hierarchy of carpet.\n\n01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:29.440\nAlright, sorry.\n\n01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:30.440\nContinue, please.\n\n01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:32.440\nDraw a fire.\n\n01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:34.440\nI had a question about community.\n\n01:10:34.440 --> 01:10:37.440\nCan Chang Astral project?\n\n01:10:37.440 --> 01:10:42.440\nThere's an episode where they all go out to...\n\n01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:46.440\nAnd, you know, Brita wants to spray paint the billboard or whatever,\n\n01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:48.440\nand she's hanging out with Mike L.\n\n01:10:48.440 --> 01:10:50.440\nAnd then Chang is like running through the theater,\n\n01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:53.440\nbut no one acknowledges him whatsoever.\n\n01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:56.440\nAnd then there's another time at the table where...\n\n01:10:56.440 --> 01:10:58.440\nJust like no one acknowledges him, and I'm like,\n\n01:10:58.440 --> 01:10:59.440\nis he really there?\n\n01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:01.440\nIs he Abe's imaginary friend?\n\n01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:04.440\nThe idea was that he might...\n\n01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:06.440\nHe himself might be a ghost.\n\n01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:09.440\nOr he might have been interacting with ghosts all night.\n\n01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:12.440\nWell, I would imagine if you could ask for a project that you could...\n\n01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:13.440\nThat's your ghost.\n\n01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:14.440\nRight.\n\n01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:15.440\nYou're asked for a project and he's a ghost.\n\n01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:16.440\nYeah, and I...\n\n01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:17.440\nLike, thank you.\n\n01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:18.440\nI loved that episode.\n\n01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:19.440\nAnd I...\n\n01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:21.440\nGod, like,

around\n\n01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:36.440\nas a streaming thing,\n\n01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:41.440\nif maybe something on the table were like,\n\n01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:47.440\noh, we'd pay more if you

--> 01:13:58.440\nYou're like, hey, potassium plus fluoride equals potassium fluoride.\n\n01:13:58.440 --> 01:14:00.440\nI don't think that's how it works.\n\n01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:01.440\nOkay.\n\n01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:02.440\nAll right.\n\n01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:09.440\nLook, Steve, what's your favorite hydrocarbon?\n\n01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:10.440\nTop five.\n\n01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:12.440\nTop five hydrocarbons.\n\n01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:13.440\nMethane.\n\n01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:14.440\nMethane.\n\n01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:15.440\nJust go in order.\n\n01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:16.440\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:17.440\nI got a soft spot for hexane.\n\n01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:18.440\nOh, okay.\n\n01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:19.440\nYeah.\n\n01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:20.440\nOh, wow.\n\n01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:21.440\nThat's a fucking hot take.\n\n01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:22.440\nThat's a fucking, yeah.\n\n01:14:22.440 --> 01:14:25.440\nThat's a sentence I never thought I would hear today.\n\n01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:28.440\nIt's a sentence I've never said before.\n\n01:14:28.440 --> 01:14:30.440\nAll right.\n\n01:14:30.440 --> 01:14:32.440\nNow, is hexane a hydrocarbon?\n\n01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:33.440\nYeah.\n\n01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:34.440\nGreat.\n\n01:14:34.440 --> 01:14:38.440\nIt's like six aims.\n\n01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:42.440\nAnd I'm sure there's exothermic reactions involved there, right?\n\n01:14:42.440 --> 01:14:44.440\nWell, it's pretty flammable, yeah.\n\n01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:45.440\nYeah.\n\n01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:46.440\nYeah.\n\n01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:54.280\nActually, it's a cool demo that you, the, the, it evaporates and the vapor is both heavier\n\n01:14:54.280 --> 01:14:56.280\nthan air and super flammable.\n\n01:14:56.280 --> 01:15:01.440\nSo you can pour it like down a ramp to a candle and then it burns up the whole ramp.\n\n01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:02.440\nKeith?\n\n01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:03.440\nThat's a good one.\n\n01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:04.440\nFor $5.\n\n01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:05.440\nOut of my own pocket.\n\n01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:09.440\nAt what temperature is methane liquid?\n\n01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:10.440\nOh.\n\n01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:19.440\nI literally just taught about the boiling points of hydrocarbons last week, and I don't know.\n\n01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:21.440\nYou can look at the periodic table.\n\n01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:22.440\nYeah.\n\n01:15:22.440 --> 01:15:23.440\nNo.\n\n01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:25.440\nI it's it's cold.\n\n01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:26.440\nIt's really cold.\n\n01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:27.440\nIt's got to be real cold.\n\n01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:28.440\nIt's got to be real.\n\n01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:29.440\nYou got to be on one of them.\n\n01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:31.440\nIt's got to be real cold.\n\n01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:34.440\nThat's pretty much the level of expertise I bring to my classroom.\n\n01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:35.440\nYeah.\n\n01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:38.440\nWhat's the boiling point of this real cold really cold?\n\n01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:40.440\nAre there like seas of it?\n\n01:15:40.440 --> 01:15:44.440\nMan, as far as I'm concerned, you're bulletproof because you tied a motherfucking bow tie without\n\n01:15:44.440 --> 01:15:45.440\nlooking like that.\n\n01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:46.440\nYou are now.\n\n01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:48.440\nAnd while being yelled at.\n\n01:15:48.440 --> 01:15:50.440\nYou're, you're, you're my Superman.\n\n01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:55.440\nIs it, is it, is it, you know, if it's prying, whatever, because you have students, whatever.\n\n01:15:55.440 --> 01:15:57.440\nI, I, like, like, how did you guys meet?\n\n01:15:57.440 --> 01:15:58.440\nThat's what I want to know.\n\n01:15:58.440 --> 01:16:01.440\nI want to hear the name of the group.\n\n01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:02.440\nWe won't.\n\n01:16:02.440 --> 01:16:03.440\nYeah.\n\n01:16:03.440 --> 01:16:05.440\nWe met on the online before the web.\n\n01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:06.440\nYeah.\n\n01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:10.440\nI had written an article for wired about gay and lesbian teenagers building community\n\n01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:16.440\non America online and everybody said, yeah, American online sucks, but check out use net.\n\n01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:21.440\nSo I went to use net and I had just spent a month and a half interviewing these little\n\n01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:26.440\ngay kids who were like saving each other from suicide and taking each other in when they\n\n01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:28.440\nran away from their abusive parents and whatnot.\n\n01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:35.440\nAnd the first thing I see on use net was some bitchy queen saying, oh, these young gay kids\n\n01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:37.440\nthese days, they're all airheads and twinks.\n\n01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:41.440\nThey're squandering the freedoms we fought so hard for at Stonewall.\n\n01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:42.440\nOkay.\n\n01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:44.440\nAnd it was not me.\n\n01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:45.440\nNo, it was not you.\n\n01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:46.440\nIt was not me.\n\n01:16:46.440 --> 01:16:47.440\nIt is roommate.\n\n01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:48.440\nYeah.\n\n01:16:48.440 --> 01:16:49.440\nNo.\n\n01:16:49.440 --> 01:16:52.440\nAnd so, so I wrote back and I said, no, actually, they're amazing.\n\n01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:56.440\nAnd you know, I have this article and wired magazine, blah, blah, blah.\n\n01:16:56.440 --> 01:17:01.440\nKeith wrote me the next day and said, are you the same Steve Silverman who reviews Grateful\n\n01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:04.440\nDead shows for this online community called the will.\n\n01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:06.440\nThat's the connection is the dead.\n\n01:17:06.440 --> 01:17:07.440\nIt's true.\n\n01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:11.440\nAnd he, and he, and he said gay dead heads are rare, which was true.\n\n01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:14.440\nAnd so I walked into a gay dead heads are rare.\n\n01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:16.440\nYeah, they, they, they are.\n\n01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:18.440\nThey're more common now, but yeah.\n\n01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:21.440\nI mentioned, well, anything dead head is rare, like black dead heads are rare.\n\n01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:22.440\nYeah.\n\n01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:23.440\nWomen dead heads are rare.\n\n01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:24.440\nYes.\n\n01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:25.440\nThere's only a lot of women.\n\n01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:26.440\nOkay.\n\n01:17:26.440 --> 01:17:27.440\nWell, they're half the plan.\n\n01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:28.440\nThere are zero gay parent heads.\n\n01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:30.440\nThere's only there are no gay parents.\n\n01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:32.440\nAnyway, we have better tastes than that.\n\n01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:34.440\nOkay.\n\n01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:39.440\nSo after I talked to Keith on the phone a couple of times, I went to meet him at a brew pub\n\n01:17:39.440 --> 01:17:45.440\nin Berkeley and I walked in, we had not talked about our ages or our appearance.\n\n01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:48.440\nAnd so I am 12 years older than Keith.\n\n01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:50.440\nOh, that's so gross.\n\n01:17:50.440 --> 01:17:51.440\nI know it's gross.\n\n01:17:51.440 --> 01:17:53.440\nI'm 12 years older than Cody.\n\n01:17:53.440 --> 01:17:59.440\nSo, so in any case, I walked into the brew pub and there was this fucking gorgeous guy\n\n01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:02.440\nand I thought to myself, oh, this is going to be a nightmare for him.\n\n01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:07.440\nHe's going to think like I'm some old troll from the internet, but actually he liked me\n\n01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:10.440\nand we liked each other and we've been together for 25 years.\n\n01:18:10.440 --> 01:18:11.440\nWow.\n\n01:18:11.440 --> 01:18:21.440\nAnd about a month, about a month and a half after we met, we were on fish tour together.\n\n01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:22.440\nWe were.\n\n01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:23.440\nOkay.\n\n01:18:23.440 --> 01:18:25.440\nWe went to show in Chico actually.\n\n01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:28.440\nThe only time I've been to Chico, I saw fish play in the gym.\n\n01:18:28.440 --> 01:18:29.440\nMatthews.\n\n01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:30.440\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:33.440\nGod, no, we haven't had a taste of that.\n\n01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:34.440\nSteve's not here.\n\n01:18:34.440 --> 01:18:36.440\nCan I ask you both?\n\n01:18:36.440 --> 01:18:39.440\nSo you're both dead heads and fish, fish, fish food?\n\n01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:40.440\nWhat do you call fish lovers?\n\n01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:41.440\nFans.\n\n01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:42.440\nFans with a pH.\n\n01:18:42.440 --> 01:18:43.440\nWhat?\n\n01:18:43.440 --> 01:18:44.440\nFins.\n\n01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:45.440\nFins.\n\n01:18:45.440 --> 01:18:46.440\nFanatics.\n\n01:18:46.440 --> 01:18:48.440\nFanatics, they call them.\n\n01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:50.440\nAnd I'm not talking shit.\n\n01:18:50.440 --> 01:18:54.440\nWhat is the appeal of dead head, like Grateful Dad and fish?\n\n01:18:54.440 --> 01:18:57.440\nBecause I listened to it and I don't really get it.\n\n01:18:57.440 --> 01:18:58.440\nYeah.\n\n01:18:58.440 --> 01:18:59.440\nIt's improvised.\n\n01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:04.440\nYou know, jazz style improvisation applied to rock and roll music, basically.\n\n01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:09.440\nSo if you, you know, if you think, if you hear jazz and you think boring, you probably\n\n01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:11.440\nwon't like the dead or fish.\n\n01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:12.440\nRight.\n\n01:19:12.440 --> 01:19:13.440\nRight.\n\n01:19:13.440 --> 01:19:14.440\nIt's because you're watching transparency on stage.\n\n01:19:14.440 --> 01:19:15.440\nRight.\n\n01:19:15.440 --> 01:19:16.440\nThey're doing something.\n\n01:19:16.440 --> 01:19:18.440\nThey're going like, Hey, let me try this.\n\n01:19:18.440 --> 01:19:19.440\nBoom, boom, boom.\n\n01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:20.440\nRight.\n\n01:19:20.440 --> 01:19:23.440\nAnd then like, Oh, is it really all improv or are they doing like, they have, they have\n\n01:19:23.440 --> 01:19:24.440\nobviously songs.\n\n01:19:24.440 --> 01:19:29.440\nBut they improvise segues and they, a lot of, they'll just do like, they'll just, they'll\n\n01:19:29.440 --> 01:19:30.440\njust riff for a while.\n\n01:19:30.440 --> 01:19:35.040\nSo we, no, it's not just, that's such an important distinction.\n\n01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:36.200\nIt's not just riffing.\n\n01:19:36.200 --> 01:19:40.640\nIt's more like narrative storytelling without words, basically using.\n\n01:19:40.640 --> 01:19:41.640\nBut improvisationally.\n\n01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:42.640\nYeah.\n\n01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:43.640\nYes.\n\n01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:44.640\nOkay.\n\n01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:45.640\nWow.\n\n01:19:45.640 --> 01:19:46.640\nAnd it's, it's a fish for me.\n\n01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:51.540\nThe, the, uh, what I love about their improvisations and their style is that they build these sort\n\n01:19:51.540 --> 01:19:58.640\nof repetitive, um, and yet subtly, slowly changing sort of patterns.\n\n01:19:58.640 --> 01:20:00.520\nAnd I swear it's just like how my brain works.\n\n01:20:00.520 --> 01:20:03.160\nLike I do, I do great thinking at fish shows.\n\n01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:04.160\nReally?\n\n01:20:04.160 --> 01:20:05.160\nYeah.\n\n01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:07.760\nLike they'll, that's actually a big thing for both dead and fish is that it gives one\n\n01:20:07.760 --> 01:20:12.160\na chance to be alone with oneself in a really beautiful way in a crowd of people.\n\n01:20:12.160 --> 01:20:13.160\nYeah.\n\n01:20:13.160 --> 01:20:14.160\nI love being alone around people.\n\n01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:15.640\nThat's one of my favorite things.\n\n01:20:15.640 --> 01:20:20.640\nOur friend Harris Wittels was a big fish guy, had a whole podcast about like, come\n\n01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:23.040\nat me about fish.\n\n01:20:23.040 --> 01:20:24.040\nAnd that was his whole thing.\n\n01:20:24.040 --> 01:20:27.280\nIt was like, he would write on parks and rec and was like a valued employee.\n\n01:20:27.280 --> 01:20:31.160\nAnd then he'd go to fish concerts and he was like, that's, I'd never heard it described\n\n01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:36.360\nthat way though, that it's a way to actually, it allows you to keep people at a distance.\n\n01:20:36.360 --> 01:20:41.920\nNow that Jerry has gone, uh, do you still go, did they still have dead shows?\n\n01:20:41.920 --> 01:20:42.920\nThey do.\n\n01:20:42.920 --> 01:20:43.920\nThe Dead and Company with John.\n\n01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:44.920\nDo you still go to them?\n\n01:20:44.920 --> 01:20:45.920\nNot so much.\n\n01:20:45.920 --> 01:20:47.920\nJerry, Jerry was a big piece of it.\n\n01:20:47.920 --> 01:20:48.920\nJerry was a genius.\n\n01:20:48.920 --> 01:20:54.000\nBut fish, like, let's say I, who don't know anything about any of this, if I went to like\n\n01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:58.160\njust walking cold to a fish show, what do you think my neuro-tropical-\n\n01:20:58.160 --> 01:20:59.640\nYou might think it was really boring.\n\n01:20:59.640 --> 01:21:00.640\nYeah.\n\n01:21:00.640 --> 01:21:02.640\nUm, and you might think the lyrics were nonsense.\n\n01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:06.520\nAnd you'd think that most of the fans are robotic cult members.\n\n01:21:06.520 --> 01:21:09.320\nWell, like, say things in unison.\n\n01:21:09.320 --> 01:21:15.920\nI was in like a dive bar in Orlando, Florida, and a giant group of people came in and there\n\n01:21:15.920 --> 01:21:22.360\nwas a Jimmy Buffett show had just broken up and a bunch of, you know, 50-year-old, 50-something,\n\n01:21:22.360 --> 01:21:27.560\n60-somethings, parrot heads came in and there was the nicest, happiest fans I've ever met\n\n01:21:27.560 --> 01:21:28.560\nin my life.\n\n01:21:28.560 --> 01:21:29.560\nThat's great.\n\n01:21:29.560 --> 01:21:31.800\nAnd so like, like, there must be something going on because when I hear Jimmy Buffett,\n\n01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:33.400\nI want to take my own life.\n\n01:21:33.400 --> 01:21:34.400\nNo, I know.\n\n01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:35.400\nExactly.\n\n01:21:35.400 --> 01:21:36.400\nYeah.\n\n01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:37.400\nYeah.\n\n01:21:37.400 --> 01:21:38.400\nAbsolutely.\n\n01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:39.400\nWell, you know, I'll tell you something.\n\n01:21:39.400 --> 01:21:43.400\nActually, there is, believe it or not, a Dan Harmon Grateful Dead connection, which is\n\n01:21:43.400 --> 01:21:44.400\nthat.\n\n01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:45.400\nI'm in.\n\n01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:46.400\nYeah.\n\n01:21:46.400 --> 01:21:50.360\nWhich is that one of the things that we've been hearing about all night tonight is misfit\n\n01:21:50.360 --> 01:21:51.360\npower.\n\n01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:55.440\nThat's how Bob Weir said it about the Grateful Dead.\n\n01:21:55.440 --> 01:21:59.680\nThat's what drew people to the Grateful Dead because no, they were not cute.\n\n01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:01.120\nNo, they were not stylish.\n\n01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:05.560\nNo, it didn't matter if they were, you know, had a hit record or not.\n\n01:22:05.560 --> 01:22:10.800\nPeople would be self-selecting into the community of deadheads.\n\n01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:14.200\nAnd just because you love the music and you like the people and you love to have a good\n\n01:22:14.200 --> 01:22:19.240\ntime around these people, but not a good time like those other people have, but this good\n\n01:22:19.240 --> 01:22:20.400\ntime.\n\n01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:25.680\nAnd I think community has self-selected in the same way for people who haven't felt\n\n01:22:25.680 --> 01:22:29.920\nat home in other places in the world, but really feel at home here.\n\n01:22:29.920 --> 01:22:30.920\nYeah.\n\n01:22:30.920 --> 01:22:32.920\nWe're like juggalos.\n\n01:22:32.920 --> 01:22:33.920\nAll right.\n\n01:22:33.920 --> 01:22:34.920\nWho?\n\n01:22:34.920 --> 01:22:39.920\nHow do you guys feel about Rush?\n\n01:22:39.920 --> 01:22:40.920\nNot.\n\n01:22:40.920 --> 01:22:46.200\nDon't ask us about every damn rock rush.\n\n01:22:46.200 --> 01:22:50.480\nOkay, lightning bonus round, name bands.\n\n01:22:50.480 --> 01:22:55.000\nWhen I listened to Phil Collins, nobody has the relationship with Phil Collins that I\n\n01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:56.000\nhave.\n\n01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:02.280\nI had a roommate once who had the same relationship with Phil Collins that I had.\n\n01:23:02.280 --> 01:23:06.040\nAnd we would go like, yeah, she seems to have an invisible touch.\n\n01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:08.160\nAnd we were like, we were into it.\n\n01:23:08.160 --> 01:23:14.960\nIt was, it did, Phil Collins wasn't doing anything wrong and we were doing something\n\n01:23:14.960 --> 01:23:15.960\nright.\n\n01:23:15.960 --> 01:23:16.960\nYes, he was.\n\n01:23:16.960 --> 01:23:17.960\nHe was.\n\n01:23:17.960 --> 01:23:18.960\nYou dicks.\n\n01:23:18.960 --> 01:23:19.960\nPhil Collins.\n\n01:23:19.960 --> 01:23:20.960\nThat's the thing.\n\n01:23:20.960 --> 01:23:24.760\nLike correct me if I'm wrong, not to high road him, but go ahead and fucking high road\n\n01:23:24.760 --> 01:23:25.840\nhim.\n\n01:23:25.840 --> 01:23:29.840\nLike that's the shit you're escaping when you become a deadhead or a fish band.\n\n01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:34.400\nIt's like you're escaping the fucking snobbery, right?\n\n01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:42.280\nNo, you're escaping the banality like you're just like, you know what?\n\n01:23:42.280 --> 01:23:46.080\nI don't know anything about fucking why this is good or bad music, but I'm just going to\n\n01:23:46.080 --> 01:23:47.080\nhang out.\n\n01:23:47.080 --> 01:23:48.080\nYeah.\n\n01:23:48.080 --> 01:23:53.960\nI mean, Phil Collins, you know, he's not my favorite, but when you when you sing, it's\n\n01:23:53.960 --> 01:23:54.960\nwho was there.\n\n01:23:54.960 --> 01:23:55.960\nIt's my eggshell.\n\n01:23:55.960 --> 01:24:00.600\nWhat eggshell did you eat when you were fucking going from an embryo to a chicken?\n\n01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:03.120\nI love Neil Diamond way too much.\n\n01:24:03.120 --> 01:24:06.600\nPeople have a like love hate and I would never take that away from you.\n\n01:24:06.600 --> 01:24:10.640\nNo, because I'm a good friend.\n\n01:24:10.640 --> 01:24:11.640\nPhil Collins.\n\n01:24:11.640 --> 01:24:15.160\nI mean, Neil Diamond.\n\n01:24:15.160 --> 01:24:16.160\nCome on.\n\n01:24:16.160 --> 01:24:17.280\nThere's not even a fucking contest there.\n\n01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:18.780\nOh, there is.\n\n01:24:18.780 --> 01:24:19.780\nBut who?\n\n01:24:19.780 --> 01:24:20.780\nWho?\n\n01:24:20.780 --> 01:24:21.780\nHe was a Jew.\n\n01:24:21.780 --> 01:24:22.780\nHe was a Jew.\n\n01:24:22.780 --> 01:24:23.780\nHe was a Jew.\n\n01:24:23.780 --> 01:24:24.780\nHe was a Jew.\n\n01:24:24.780 --> 01:24:26.960\nHe was a Jew who sang gospel music.\n\n01:24:26.960 --> 01:24:27.960\nOh my God.\n\n01:24:27.960 --> 01:24:33.000\nPhil Collins is a drummer in a band that should never have existed.\n\n01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:34.000\nI agree.\n\n01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:35.000\nI agree.\n\n01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:36.000\nHe's the fucking drummer.\n\n01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:37.000\nWe agree on that.\n\n01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:38.000\nMaster.\n\n01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:39.000\nWe agree on that.\n\n01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:42.360\nThe next you're going to say you love Sting and the police like fucking booze.\n\n01:24:42.360 --> 01:24:43.360\nI don't.\n\n01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:44.360\nSting's great.\n\n01:24:44.360 --> 01:24:45.360\nI love the police.\n\n01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:46.760\nFuck all of

01:29:06.000\nI've ever seen Rob Schrab do.\n\n01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.640\nWe were in LA not that long.\n\n01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:12.600\nAnd Schrab was like, Schrab came to, Schrab said,\n\n01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:20.560\nI'm pretty sure I think Nicholas Cage drove by me\n\n01:29:20.560 --> 01:29:22.560\non a motorcycle today.\n\n01:29:22.560 --> 01:29:25.200\nAnd this is like 20 years ago.\n\n01:29:25.200 --> 01:29:27.560\nAnd I was like, how do you know it was Nicholas Cage?\n\n01:29:27.560 --> 01:29:31.360\nHe was like, well, he was wearing a helmet.\n\n01:29:31.360 --> 01:29:34.720\nAnd I was like, well, then how on earth\n\n01:29:34.720 --> 01:29:36.240\nwould you know it was Nicholas Cage?\n\n01:29:36.240 --> 01:29:41.280\nAnd Schrab answered my question by holding a folder\n\n01:29:41.280 --> 01:29:43.200\nin front of his face.\n\n01:29:43.200 --> 01:29:46.280\nAnd with his eyes and eyebrows alone,\n\n01:29:46.280 --> 01:29:49.600\nconvinced it going like, oh, that's Nicholas Cage.\n\n01:29:49.600 --> 01:29:51.080\nSo.\n\n01:29:51.080 --> 01:29:52.120\nNice.\n\n01:29:52.120 --> 01:29:55.000\nNice.\n\n01:29:55.000 -->

gave him that out.\n\n01:30:25.880 --> 01:30:26.400\nHe did that.\n\n01:30:26.400 --> 01:30:26.880\nThat's fine.\n\n01:30:26.880 --> 01:30:28.040\nGive me it now.\n\n01:30:28.040 --> 01:30:30.080\nWhat did you do that made Dan so mad?\n\n01:30:30.080 --> 01:30:32.440\nWell, Dan said he wanted a.\n\n01:30:32.440 --> 01:30:35.000\nHe was working on his panic room.\n\n01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:35.760\nSure.\n\n01:30:35.760 --> 01:30:42.000\nAnd then I said, you should have a panic at the disco room.\n\n01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:43.280\nNo, that's not.\n\n01:30:43.280 --> 01:30:43.960\nWell, that's.\n\n01:30:43.960 --> 01:30:47.440\nAnd then he said, I just want to take a bat.\n\n01:30:47.440 --> 01:30:48.320\nThat's a great idea.\n\n01:30:48.320 --> 01:30:50.720\nAnd beat the hell out of you.\n\n01:30:50.720 --> 01:30:52.360\nI just want to beat.\n\n01:30:52.360 --> 01:30:54.800\nAnd he was like, and I mean it.\n\n01:30:54.800 --> 01:30:56.040\nThat's not.\n\n01:30:56.040 --> 01:30:57.480\nNothing about that is accurate.\n\n01:30:57.480 --> 01:30:58.640\nThat is so true.\n\n01:30:58.640 --> 01:30:59.240\nThat's not.\n\n01:30:59.240 --> 01:31:01.040\nNothing about that is accurate.\n\n01:31:01.040 --> 01:31:02.880\nNo, it's totally accurate.\n\n01:31:02.880 --> 01:31:03.560\nSo, Dan.\n\n01:31:03.560 --> 01:31:05.000\nYou wanted to beat the hell out of me.\n\n01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:06.480\nAbout the fucking show.\n\n01:31:06.480 --> 01:31:08.760\nI'm trying to write Rick and Morty with you.\n\n01:31:08.760 --> 01:31:09.240\nRight.\n\n01:31:09.240 --> 01:31:12.680\nAnd I said, halfway through a rant, as I riff,\n\n01:31:12.680 --> 01:31:15.360\nI go like, oh, well, I don't know.\n\n01:31:15.360 --> 01:31:16.840\nMaybe it'd be like a thing like this,\n\n01:31:16.840 --> 01:31:18.240\nand I want to be like that.\n\n01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:23.040\nAnd I said, as I want to, I said, oh, well,\n\n01:31:23.040 --> 01:31:25.520\nthat would be like a Christopher Durang thing.\n\n01:31:25.520 --> 01:31:29.720\nAnd it's like, in my mind, I was going like, well,\n\n01:31:29.720 --> 01:31:32.920\nmaybe it's like so much metaphor that it's absurd.\n\n01:31:32.920 --> 01:31:33.920\nYou hang a lantern on it.\n\n01:31:33.920 --> 01:31:35.280\nI don't even know what I was referencing.\n\n01:31:35.280 --> 01:31:36.800\nI'm not like a theater major.\n\n01:31:36.800 --> 01:31:38.760\nBut I'm like, Christopher Durang.\n\n01:31:38.760 --> 01:31:40.000\nI throw it out.\n\n01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:41.400\nI throw out a lot of things.\n\n01:31:41.400 --> 01:31:42.400\nI keep talking.\n\n01:31:42.400 --> 01:31:45.320\nI keep talking because I fucking try and

you?\n\n01:39:36.040 --> 01:39:37.480\nLike, that's so fucking dumb.\n\n01:39:37.480 --> 01:39:38.480\nDo you?\n\n01:39:38.480 --> 01:39:40.840\nWell, like, what does it mean if you don't mean it?\n\n01:39:40.840 --> 01:39:42.000\nLike, what do we say?\n\n01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:45.040\nNo.\n\n01:39:45.040 --> 01:39:47.280\nI don't know what those words mean.\n\n01:39:47.280 --> 01:39:49.080\nWhat does it mean?\n\n01:39:49.080 --> 01:39:50.920\nThose words can be low eyes.\n\n01:39:50.920 --> 01:39:52.200\nPeople can go, I love Hitler.\n\n01:39:52.200 --> 01:39:53.000\nThey don't mean it.\n\n01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.920\nLike, if you don't love Hitler, like, that\n\n01:39:55.920 --> 01:39:57.040\nmeans you love racism.\n\n01:39:57.040 --> 01:39:57.720\nJust stop.\n\n01:39:57.720 --> 01:39:59.840\nJust stop.\n\n01:39:59.840 --> 01:40:03.000\nSee, you guys lured me into this fucking trap.\n\n01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:04.560\nThis is what always happens to me.\n\n01:40:04.560 --> 01:40:07.280\nHey, Dan, why don't you express yourself as a person?\n\n01:40:07.280 --> 01:40:09.280\nFucking pussy.\n\n01:40:09.280 --> 01:40:11.840\nFucking shit face.\n\n01:40:11.840 --> 01:40:15.760\nYou know, you fucking, like, you're neurodiverse.\n\n01:40:15.760 --> 01:40:17.840\nFucking shit face.\n\n01:40:17.840 --> 01:40:19.360\nLike, they lure me into this trap.\n\n01:40:19.360 --> 01:40:20.760\nJust say you love Rob Schrab.\n\n01:40:20.760 --> 01:40:22.840\nWhatever I do, I love Rob Schrab.\n\n01:40:22.840 --> 01:40:24.240\nThis is his Billy Zane.\n\n01:40:24.240 --> 01:40:26.840\nWill you leave him alone?\n\n01:40:26.840 --> 01:40:28.960\nGod, he doesn't want to do Billy Zane.\n\n01:40:28.960 --> 01:40:29.840\nI'll give you a choice.\n\n01:40:29.840 --> 01:40:33.320\nEither do Billy Zane or tell Rob you love him and made it.\n\n01:40:33.320 --> 01:40:35.320\nWhy do you guys always say, I love Rob Schrab.\n\n01:40:35.320 --> 01:40:36.960\nI don't want to do Billy Zane.\n\n01:40:36.960 --> 01:40:38.160\nYeah.\n\n01:40:38.160 --> 01:40:38.920\nYeah.\n\n01:40:38.920 --> 01:40:42.560\nWhat do you guys want?\n\n01:40:42.560 --> 01:40:46.400\nI don't approve of any of this.\n\n01:40:46.400 --> 01:40:49.280\nIs that just like, is that what the Midwest is?\n\n01:40:49.280 --> 01:40:50.800\nIs just that much withholding?\n\n01:40:50.800 --> 01:40:51.600\nI don't know.\n\n01:40:51.600 --> 01:40:54.400\nIt's just an idea of I love you, I love you, I love you.\n\n01:40:54.400 --> 01:40:56.720\nIt's like a fucking poker chip you put on the table.\n\n01:40:56.720 --> 01:40:58.920\nLike, what the fuck does it mean?\n\n01:40:58.920 --> 01:41:01.680\nLike, it means you, like, got a chip at the fucking cashier.\n\n01:41:01.680 --> 01:41:03.080\nDad's like, I love you.\n\n01:41:03.080 --> 01:41:04.720\nLike, people go, I love you.\n\n01:41:04.720 --> 01:41:05.600\nI love you, too.\n\n01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:06.440\nLike, I'm trying.\n\n01:41:06.440 --> 01:41:08.720\nLike, Cody's family, like, they say it.\n\n01:41:08.720 --> 01:41:09.600\nAnd I believe them.\n\n01:41:09.600 --> 01:41:11.040\nAnd I'm like, I love you, too.\n\n01:41:11.040 --> 01:41:14.720\nIt's like, hard for me to say it to Cody's dad.\n\n01:41:14.720 --> 01:41:17.160\nBut like, those people say, I love you.\n\n01:41:17.160 --> 01:41:19.400\nLike, they're fucking just hanging out.\n\n01:41:19.400 --> 01:41:20.720\nLike, it's just like farting.\n\n01:41:20.720 --> 01:41:21.560\nAnd I was like, I love you.\n\n01:41:21.560 --> 01:41:24.920\nI'm like, I don't know, I don't know what I mean.\n\n01:41:24.920 --> 01:41:26.840\nThat's like, this is not the family I come from.\n\n01:41:26.840 --> 01:41:30.000\nIt's just like, like, those words mean something.\n\n01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:31.040\nCan you help me out here?\n\n01:41:31.040 --> 01:41:32.200\nWhat's your love language?\n\n01:41:32.200 --> 01:41:34.520\nBecause it sounds like words of affirmation aren't it.\n\n01:41:34.520 --> 01:41:36.040\nBut you got to have one.\n\n01:41:36.040 --> 01:41:37.160\nGood boy.\n\n01:41:37.160 --> 01:41:39.560\nI mean, it's not like, this is a normal thing that happens.\n\n01:41:39.560 --> 01:41:41.720\nPeople are like, I don't want all these fucking gifts,\n\n01:41:41.720 --> 01:41:42.720\nyou know, or whatever.\n\n01:41:42.720 --> 01:41:46.520\nWith Cody, it's like, like, all bets are off.\n\n01:41:46.520 --> 01:41:47.240\nIt's just whatever.\n\n01:41:47.240 --> 01:41:51.320\nAnd I think that maybe part of the problem is that I go,\n\n01:41:51.320 --> 01:41:52.880\noh, that's an intimacy thing.\n\n01:41:52.880 --> 01:41:55.160\nLike, love is for partners.\n\n01:41:55.160 --> 01:41:57.400\nAnd that makes it maybe sexual.\n\n01:41:57.400 --> 01:42:00.200\nAnd so maybe then you're not supposed to say,\n\n01:42:00.200 --> 01:42:03.080\nI love you to people that you're not partners with.\n\n01:42:03.080 --> 01:42:05.240\nWell, Keith and Steve, 25 years.\n\n01:42:05.240 --> 01:42:08.760\nLike, can you define what love is between you two?\n\n01:42:08.760 --> 01:42:11.200\nYeah, we don't want to kill each other.\n\n01:42:11.200 --> 01:42:13.800\nWell, we take the desire to kill each other,\n\n01:42:13.800 --> 01:42:16.720\nand we crumple it down into a tiny little ball.\n\n01:42:16.720 --> 01:42:18.200\nAre you guys, it's Thanksgiving.\n\n01:42:18.200 --> 01:42:19.440\nWhat do you guys do?\n\n01:42:19.440 --> 01:42:22.880\nHow are your relationships with your family?\n\n01:42:22.880 --> 01:42:25.040\nBut that's important.\n\n01:42:25.040 --> 01:42:26.400\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:42:26.400 --> 01:42:28.880\nBut you.\n\n01:42:28.880 --> 01:42:29.960\nThanks.\n\n01:42:29.960 --> 01:42:32.920\nAre your families hip to your relationship?\n\n01:42:32.920 --> 01:42:35.200\nOh, yeah, they are.\n\n01:42:35.200 --> 01:42:38.800\nBut there are some political issues.\n\n01:42:38.800 --> 01:42:42.680\nMy family is liberal, and Keith's family not so much.\n\n01:42:42.680 --> 01:42:45.240\nSo the last three years have been terrible for us\n\n01:42:45.240 --> 01:42:46.840\nin that regard, actually.\n\n01:42:46.840 --> 01:42:51.440\nReally, it was the election that actually created a divide.\n\n01:42:51.440 --> 01:42:53.880\nThe election and the propaganda wave.\n\n01:42:53.880 --> 01:42:55.280\nBecause it brought it to the fore.\n\n01:42:55.280 --> 01:42:56.160\nIt's true.\n\n01:42:56.160 --> 01:42:59.080\nI mean, my mother-in-law literally\n\n01:42:59.080 --> 01:43:01.600\nmade us lovely embroidered tea towels\n\n01:43:01.600 --> 01:43:04.120\nwith her name before the election.\n\n01:43:04.120 --> 01:43:05.720\nBut there's been a breach.\n\n01:43:05.720 --> 01:43:09.080\nWhen you guys first declared your love to your families,\n\n01:43:09.080 --> 01:43:12.720\nwere they both sides OK with it, or was it a little rough?\n\n01:43:12.720 --> 01:43:15.120\nOh, you have a great story on this one.\n\n01:43:15.120 --> 01:43:18.240\nWhat the, when my dad pulled you aside.\n\n01:43:18.240 --> 01:43:19.720\nOh, yeah, that's right.\n\n01:43:19.720 --> 01:43:22.560\nI was scared to meet Keith's family,\n\n01:43:22.560 --> 01:43:24.440\nbecause they're like Midwesters.\n\n01:43:24.440 --> 01:43:27.480\nKeith's dad was literally the mayor of Normal, Illinois.\n\n01:43:30.480 --> 01:43:31.680\nI've been there.\n\n01:43:31.680 --> 01:43:35.720\nJust outside of not gay Wisconsin.\n\n01:43:35.720 --> 01:43:38.920\nI think a bit more as flat kids.\n\n01:43:38.920 --> 01:43:41.520\nNeuro-typical Wisconsin.\n\n01:43:41.520 --> 01:43:43.680\nThere are trucks all over that town\n\n01:43:43.680 --> 01:43:46.080\nthat say normal police.\n\n01:43:46.080 --> 01:43:47.240\nThat's so cool.\n\n01:43:47.240 --> 01:43:49.680\nNothing to see here.com.\n\n01:43:49.680 --> 01:43:53.480\nBut so when I met them, I'm a Jewish Fagola,\n\n01:43:53.480 --> 01:43:57.840\n12 years older than their beautiful blonde son.\n\n01:43:57.840 --> 01:44:00.240\nMy parents were communists, et cetera.\n\n01:44:00.240 --> 01:44:03.120\nYeah, I don't think they knew that at the time.\n\n01:44:03.120 --> 01:44:06.920\nBut I thought that I might be their worst nightmare, frankly.\n\n01:44:06.920 --> 01:44:10.320\nBut Keith's dad took me aside and said,\n\n01:44:10.320 --> 01:44:12.320\nwe know that you're very special to Keith,\n\n01:44:12.320 --> 01:44:13.960\nso you're very special to us.\n\n01:44:13.960 --> 01:44:14.560\nThat's awesome.\n\n01:44:14.560 --> 01:44:15.880\nAnd that was wonderful.\n\n01:44:15.880 --> 01:44:17.000\nI don't want to fucking die.\n\n01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:21.320\nSo I hope we can find our way back to that.\n\n01:44:21.320 --> 01:44:23.040\nYeah.\n\n01:44:23.040 --> 01:44:24.840\nThose stories over and over again,\n\n01:44:24.840 --> 01:44:29.800\nevery time there's a face-to-face encounter,\n\n01:44:29.800 --> 01:44:33.560\nI don't want to publicize anybody.\n\n01:44:33.560 --> 01:44:34.840\nI don't want to out them.\n\n01:44:34.840 --> 01:44:38.400\nI have a family member who's there in a certain neighborhood\n\n01:44:38.400 --> 01:44:43.360\nand in their neighborhood.\n\n01:44:43.360 --> 01:44:47.840\nThere's a guy who's a very popular cool guy\n\n01:44:47.840 --> 01:44:50.400\nand all the kids play in his yard.\n\n01:44:50.400 --> 01:44:51.920\nAnd he's a super cool guy.\n\n01:44:51.920 --> 01:44:56.760\nHe's like a stand-up, amazing, cool neighborhood dad guy.\n\n01:44:56.760 --> 01:44:58.880\nAnd he has a flagpole in his backyard.\n\n01:44:58.880 --> 01:45:01.760\nAnd he went to some fucking, he went off on some trip.\n\n01:45:01.760 --> 01:45:04.080\nAnd he had a great time and good for him.\n\n01:45:04.080 --> 01:45:05.000\nAnd he paid his money.\n\n01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.280\nAnd he came back with this MAGA flag.\n\n01:45:07.280 --> 01:45:11.160\nAnd he hoisted it up on his backyard flagpole.\n\n01:45:11.160 --> 01:45:16.200\nAnd this friend of mine that all she could see out\n\n01:45:16.200 --> 01:45:19.560\nher back window was this guy's flag,\n\n01:45:19.560 --> 01:45:21.160\nwhich is where my story would end.\n\n01:45:21.160 --> 01:45:22.480\nI would just come on this podcast\n\n01:45:22.480 --> 01:45:24.920\nand I'd go, hey, the next door to a piece of shit\n\n01:45:24.920 --> 01:45:26.880\nis flying his flag.\n\n01:45:26.880 --> 01:45:30.440\nShe went, she talked to him and said,\n\n01:45:30.440 --> 01:45:32.520\nwhich I wouldn't recommend.\n\n01:45:32.520 --> 01:45:35.840\nI just said, suddenly I'm not on her side\n\n01:45:35.840 --> 01:45:40.400\nfor that moment where she goes up to him and goes,\n\n01:45:40.400 --> 01:45:44.960\nthat's not really a flag about our country or our state\n\n01:45:44.960 --> 01:45:45.880\nor our city.\n\n01:45:45.880 --> 01:45:48.920\nIt's a flag about this political platform.\n\n01:45:48.920 --> 01:45:51.120\nAnd it's like, all I can see out my back window\n\n01:45:51.120 --> 01:45:52.800\nand you're so cool to our kids.\n\n01:45:52.800 --> 01:45:56.360\nAnd I just, it's right in my face.\n\n01:45:56.360 --> 01:45:57.360\nI look out my window.\n\n01:45:57.360 --> 01:45:59.240\nAnd the guy's response was like, you're right.\n\n01:45:59.240 --> 01:46:00.160\nIt's pretty obnoxious.\n\n01:46:00.160 --> 01:46:01.160\nAnd he took it down.\n\n01:46:01.160 --> 01:46:01.660\nNice.\n\n01:46:01.660 --> 01:46:02.160\nWow.\n\n01:46:02.160 --> 01:46:03.680\nThat's every story.\n\n01:46:03.680 --> 01:46:05.360\nEvery story.\n\n01:46:05.360 --> 01:46:09.400\nLike there aren't any stories about actual human beings\n\n01:46:09.400 --> 01:46:12.200\ntalking to each other where then someone pulls out\n\n01:46:12.200 --> 01:46:15.400\na machete and goes like, I love Trump.\n\n01:46:15.400 --> 01:46:18.360\nOr I love socialism.\n\n01:46:18.360 --> 01:46:20.760\nAny time people are talking to each other,\n\n01:46:20.760 --> 01:46:25.000\nit's basically like, what the fuck are you going to do?\n\n01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:25.480\nAnyways.\n\n01:46:25.480 --> 01:46:27.680\nWell, that's one thing we have to fight our way out of\n\n01:46:27.680 --> 01:46:31.440\nis everybody stereotyping everybody else and having these.\n\n01:46:31.440 --> 01:46:34.960\nThat's the, that will be the irony of the internet\n\n01:46:34.960 --> 01:46:41.440\nis like we all got connected and it disconnected all of us.\n\n01:46:41.440 --> 01:46:43.760\nLike more than we had ever been.\n\n01:46:43.760 --> 01:46:48.280\nBecause when we were all just trapped in apartments\n\n01:46:48.280 --> 01:46:53.880\nwatching Welcome Back Connor on a TV, our intro back\n\n01:46:53.880 --> 01:46:56.160\nConnor.\n\n01:46:56.160 --> 01:47:00.360\nOur internet was talking to the random stranger\n\n01:47:00.360 --> 01:47:03.680\nthat we did laundry with in the shared laundry room.\n\n01:47:03.680 --> 01:47:09.240\nAnd the internet now tells us, and not unrightfully so,\n\n01:47:09.240 --> 01:47:13.520\nbut tells us like that guy that's doing laundry with you,\n\n01:47:13.520 --> 01:47:17.000\nhe's a much smaller piece of the puzzle.\n\n01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:20.880\nLike if you're a true crime fan, that guy's\n\n01:47:20.880 --> 01:47:23.800\ngoing to kill your daughter and eat her.\n\n01:47:23.800 --> 01:47:28.400\nLike it makes more sense to compartmentalize that person\n\n01:47:28.400 --> 01:47:30.240\nthat way.\n\n01:47:30.240 --> 01:47:39.160\nThe internet, we thought it was going to end disconnection.\n\n01:47:39.160 --> 01:47:41.800\nIt was like a short circuit.\n\n01:47:41.800 --> 01:47:43.160\nI love that

yesterday.\n\n01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.640\nAnd we would like to take that person\n\n01:47:54.640 --> 01:47:59.720\nthat we were yesterday onto the tomorrow of online\n\n01:47:59.720 --> 01:48:02.480\nand say, hey, here's me.\n\n01:48:02.480 --> 01:48:04.240\nBecause who wants to dissolve and do\n\n01:48:04.240 --> 01:48:06.920\na bunch of nothingness of tomorrow?\n\n01:48:06.920 --> 01:48:10.800\nMaybe that's an uplifting thing about us.\n\n01:48:10.800 --> 01:48:12.000\nGod damn it, Harmon.\n\n01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:13.320\nDon't waste your.\n\n01:48:13.320 --> 01:48:15.000\nAll

01:48:18.920\nLet's do a rap.\n\n01:48:18.920 --> 01:48:21.560\nI mean, I'm not saying let's do a rap,\n\n01:48:21.560 --> 01:48:22.800\nbut that's the time.\n\n01:48:22.800 --> 01:48:25.120\nWould it be tedious and tiresome to just shout out\n\n01:48:25.120 --> 01:48:27.320\neverybody that came from a long distance away?\n\n01:48:27.320 --> 01:48:28.920\nThat's what I feel like we owe them,\n\n01:48:28.920 --> 01:48:31.960\nlike let's bring all the yahoos.\n\n01:48:31.960 --> 01:48:33.960\nI know we got Sarah and Austin.\n\n01:48:33.960 --> 01:48:34.960\nYou guys

you guys to be here.\n\n02:04:52.840 --> 02:04:54.960\nAnd I really value you being here.\n\n02:04:54.960 --> 02:04:55.480\nWell, thank you.\n\n02:04:55.480 --> 02:04:57.040\nAnd I hope you had a good time.\n\n02:04:57.040 --> 02:04:57.800\nIt was great.\n\n02:04:57.800 --> 02:04:58.680\nIt was awesome.\n\n02:04:58.680 --> 02:04:59.200\nAbsolutely.\n\n02:04:59.200 --> 02:05:00.440\nAnd thank you guys.\n\n02:05:00.440 --> 02:05:03.000\nYeah, thank all of you.\n\n02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:04.520\nWe have one more show left.\n\n02:05:04.520 --> 02:05:06.680\nAnd this is the ultimate cliffhanger.\n\n02:05:06.680 --> 02:05:09.480\nBut the last show is going to be the worst show.\n\n02:05:09.480 --> 02:05:10.800\nPeople are coming up here and going,\n\n02:05:10.800 --> 02:05:12.360\nI tried to get in the last show.\n\n02:05:12.360 --> 02:05:13.800\nI'm like, that's going to be the worst show.\n\n02:05:13.800 --> 02:05:14.560\nIt's going to be the worst.\n\n02:05:14.560 --> 02:05:15.440\nThe worst show.\n\n02:05:15.440 --> 02:05:18.960\nYeah, because I'm just going to not even come.\n\n02:05:18.960 --> 02:05:21.200\nBecause they're going to put chairs on the stage.\n\n02:05:21.200 --> 02:05:22.480\nIt's going to be the worst show.\n\n02:05:22.480 --> 02:05:23.440\nThis is the show that you want to be at.\n\n02:05:23.440 --> 02:05:24.320\nThis is the best show.\n\n02:05:24.320 --> 02:05:27.680\nYou came to the best one.\n\n02:05:27.680 --> 02:05:29.800\nThis is the one.\n\n02:05:29.800 --> 02:05:31.400\nThe last show is going to be garbage.\n\n02:05:31.400 --> 02:05:34.480\nLet's give it up for Keith and Steve, everybody.\n\n02:05:34.480 --> 02:05:46.240\nRob Schrab, Spencer Crittenden, Will Ashland, Danny, Josh,\n\n02:05:46.240 --> 02:05:51.360\nSamson Riley, Austin, Sarah, everybody that came tonight.\n\n02:05:51.360 --> 02:05:55.240\nChurch, Zach, Nolan, making everything happen.\n\n02:05:55.240 --> 02:06:00.080\nI'm your comptroller, Jeff Davis, your mayor, Dan Hyman.\n\n02:06:00.080 --> 02:06:01.680\nOh, yeah.\n\n02:06:01.680 --> 02:06:02.360\nOh, yeah.\n\n02:06:02.360 --> 02:06:05.120\nSteve Silverman and Keith Carricker, everybody.\n\n02:06:05.120 --> 02:06:07.920\nI really can't tell you how much you guys all mean to us.\n\n02:06:07.920 --> 02:06:09.760\nIt's sad to see it go.\n\n02:06:09.760 --> 02:06:13.680\nBut I'm so happy all you all traveled so far to come see us.\n\n02:06:13.680 --> 02:06:15.160\nDrive fast and take chances.\n\n02:06:15.160 --> 02:06:35.880\nDid you get any of that?\n\n02:06:35.880 --> 02:06:45.560\nIt's a good show.\n","cpu_time":["0.004s"],"str_size":[200061]}
