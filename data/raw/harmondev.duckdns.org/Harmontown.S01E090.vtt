{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:18.640\nHello, you beautiful sons of bitches!\n\n00:18.640 --> 00:24.320\nFrom Meltdown Comics in Hollywood, California, Harmontown is now in session.\n\n00:24.320 --> 00:28.560\nI'd like to do the lights.\n\n00:28.560 --> 00:32.720\nWelcome to the stage, the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.\n\n00:32.720 --> 00:46.760\nIt's probably not that different for them, but the lighting is very different for the\n\n00:46.760 --> 00:47.760\nperformer tonight.\n\n00:47.760 --> 00:50.200\nThey're shooting different kinds of stuff in here lately.\n\n00:50.200 --> 00:53.360\nAre they shooting like an autopsy scene?\n\n00:53.360 --> 01:00.960\nThere is what seems to be the light Quincy used to figure out how people got killed above\n\n01:00.960 --> 01:01.960\nme.\n\n01:01.960 --> 01:09.600\nI'm fine with it and I'm sure I look great, but it's just funny how the little things\n\n01:09.600 --> 01:10.600\nkind of throw you.\n\n01:10.600 --> 01:11.600\nI like these though.\n\n01:11.600 --> 01:16.640\nMaybe for D&D we could get these little kind of groovy old Tesla, like your early Edison\n\n01:16.640 --> 01:17.640\nlights.\n\n01:17.640 --> 01:20.120\nYeah, well Zach was taking me through and he's got full control over every single bulb\n\n01:20.120 --> 01:21.120\nin the building.\n\n01:21.120 --> 01:27.080\nZach, can you take us through a couple of moods right now?\n\n01:27.080 --> 01:30.360\nHere's his list of moods you can accomplish with his controls.\n\n01:30.360 --> 01:35.040\nThere's this one and there you go.\n\n01:35.040 --> 01:40.120\nI'm sure those of you listening at home understand that what we did was the old joke where there's\n\n01:40.120 --> 01:41.120\ntwo things.\n\n01:41.120 --> 01:45.440\nOne of them was light bulbs on, one was light bulbs off.\n\n01:45.440 --> 01:48.600\nOh no, but they can be slowly dimmed.\n\n01:48.600 --> 01:51.480\nSuch a terrifying effect, it's kind of nice.\n\n01:51.480 --> 01:52.480\nAlright Jeff.\n\n01:52.480 --> 01:53.480\nYes Dan?\n\n01:53.480 --> 01:56.520\nWhat I learned from the last couple of episodes is that this is going to be a segment driven\n\n01:56.520 --> 01:57.520\nshow now.\n\n01:57.520 --> 01:59.240\nWe've got segments, segments, segments.\n\n01:59.240 --> 02:00.960\nNo tangents, more segments.\n\n02:00.960 --> 02:20.160\nAlright, so here's our new segment called, it's called Help Me Help Myself.\n\n02:20.160 --> 02:21.160\nSee people love it.\n\n02:21.160 --> 02:33.440\nThey love segments.\n\n02:33.440 --> 02:36.960\nSo I need help with a couple of things.\n\n02:36.960 --> 02:42.320\nFacebook, help me with Facebook.\n\n02:42.320 --> 02:44.360\nHere's my dilemma.\n\n02:44.360 --> 02:48.600\nI've got lots of fucking problems with Facebook.\n\n02:48.600 --> 02:56.640\nSo I have a Facebook account, I have at this point, I don't know, let's just say 42,000\n\n02:56.640 --> 02:57.640\nfriends.\n\n02:57.640 --> 03:04.240\nI'm putting air quotes around friends of course because what that really means is like fans\n\n03:04.240 --> 03:11.800\nwho I considered friends and who I certainly treat better than most of my friends.\n\n03:11.800 --> 03:19.760\nMy Facebook page is, I never go to it and the inbox is just full of, you know, people\n\n03:19.760 --> 03:27.720\ngoing like, hey, I met you at such and such, it sort of renders Facebook's actual usefulness\n\n03:27.720 --> 03:29.760\nkind of neutral.\n\n03:29.760 --> 03:32.600\nIt doesn't really, Facebook isn't really useful for me.\n\n03:32.600 --> 03:36.080\nSo I never go to it and the syndrome continues.\n\n03:36.080 --> 03:40.440\nSo I'm just wondering what the hell I'm supposed to do, should, this is a question you can't\n\n03:40.440 --> 03:45.120\nreally ask without sounding like an asshole because you're like kind of humble bragging,\n\n03:45.120 --> 03:46.120\naren't you?\n\n03:46.120 --> 03:49.200\nYou're going like, somebody, what should I do?\n\n03:49.200 --> 03:54.720\nBecause there's people that have the fan things, like, oh, this is the Ronald McDonald\n\n03:54.720 --> 03:56.520\nfan page.\n\n03:56.520 --> 04:01.560\nI'm a follower of Ronald McDonald, I'm not his friend though, and then there's Ronald\n\n04:01.560 --> 04:06.720\nMcDonald's actual Facebook page, I assume, where he's like, I fucked, I fucked Grimace\n\n04:06.720 --> 04:07.720\nlast night.\n\n04:07.720 --> 04:12.400\nCheck it out, here's a picture of it, and he's like, you know, and it's cool, it's fine\n\n04:12.400 --> 04:17.240\nbecause it's like, it's only the fry guys and like, hamburger, or like, yeah, and he\n\n04:17.240 --> 04:23.400\nleaves a comment, says, Robble, Robble, and like, and, and, and, and, you know, Birdie,\n\n04:23.400 --> 04:27.200\nBirdie, Birdie liked this.\n\n04:27.200 --> 04:30.360\nBirdie likes everything.\n\n04:30.360 --> 04:35.400\nMoonhead, Moonhead's performing at the piano bar again.\n\n04:35.400 --> 04:38.000\nWas he just Mack, what was his name?\n\n04:38.000 --> 04:39.360\nI don't know, Mack, yeah, Mack.\n\n04:39.360 --> 04:40.360\nMack tonight?\n\n04:40.360 --> 04:48.280\nMack, Mack, Mack of Desperation, uh, that was the dark chapter of McDonald's, otherwise\n\n04:48.280 --> 04:52.960\nbright and shining, delightful, entertaining, cavalcade of characters.\n\n04:52.960 --> 04:57.200\nSo are you asking, should you be more, should you treat Facebook more like a band would?\n\n04:57.200 --> 05:02.240\nI need to do something, I need, I need, I need someone to Facebook coach me, I need\n\n05:02.240 --> 05:07.040\nto, I need somebody to say, here's what you do, take your existing account with your 48\n\n05:07.040 --> 05:12.160\nmillion, whatever's, you know, do you convert that into a thing?\n\n05:12.160 --> 05:15.880\nOr do you, do you have to go through and, I think if you're a friend, you have to break\n\n05:15.880 --> 05:16.880\nup a 48 million.\n\n05:16.880 --> 05:21.200\nI have to, I have to, I have to, I have to go, I have to make an announcement, and this\n\n05:21.200 --> 05:25.800\nis a thing that like LA stand-ups like go through and like, like they, I think sometimes\n\n05:25.800 --> 05:28.960\nbecause I've heard stories, that's the other thing that has me gun-shy is that people go\n\n05:28.960 --> 05:34.120\nlike, well my name's Dave Johnson, and I, they go like, oh man, I'm, you know what,\n\n05:34.120 --> 05:37.880\nI'm gonna change my Facebook account to a fan account, and then all the friends are\n\n05:37.880 --> 05:43.600\nlike, fuck you, and it's, it's, you know, there's a, it's not exciting to the audience\n\n05:43.600 --> 05:44.600\nat all.\n\n05:44.600 --> 05:48.600\nAnd I don't know why, I thought it would be, I thought maybe a Facebook expert could come\n\n05:48.600 --> 05:52.040\nup and help me, that would be amazing.\n\n05:52.040 --> 05:53.040\nLet's move on.\n\n05:53.040 --> 05:57.560\nI mean, I would, I would guess that if we asked my applause, you would get several Facebook\n\n05:57.560 --> 05:59.840\nexperts that would be quite happy to help you on that.\n\n05:59.840 --> 06:03.800\nAnd who would be quite proud to be Facebook experts, I'm sure.\n\n06:03.800 --> 06:06.600\nFacebook for me, because like, I was always, you know, like notoriously single, and I have\n\n06:06.600 --> 06:10.440\na girlfriend, but Facebook, the only, like, perceivable benefit that ever was was you could\n\n06:10.440 --> 06:13.360\ngo look up a picture of a girl you saw last night.\n\n06:13.360 --> 06:17.120\nYou could type in her name and, and, and a couple triangulating bits of information,\n\n06:17.120 --> 06:22.240\nyou go, oh okay, she was cute, or maybe she, she's a weirdo, she has a, a, a tattoo of\n\n06:22.240 --> 06:28.240\na racial slur on her forehead, or like, but like, as somebody has, like, I have no, I\n\n06:28.240 --> 06:29.240\nhave no use for it.\n\n06:29.240 --> 06:33.240\nNow, now I get in trouble, I got in trouble a little bit, not really a joking trouble\n\n06:33.240 --> 06:39.000\nwith my girlfriend today, because she was, she loves Facebook, because she's from Scotland.\n\n06:39.000 --> 06:41.320\nSo it's like, she keeps in touch with her friends and family for free.\n\n06:41.320 --> 06:42.320\nThat's great.\n\n06:42.320 --> 06:46.680\nI, I'm from here, I, I see all the people I like.\n\n06:46.680 --> 06:50.560\nI like three people from school and one of them is coming on the show tonight, and anyone\n\n06:50.560 --> 06:56.360\nelse I don't really need to talk to, but I am, because of you, I've been playing Heyday,\n\n06:56.360 --> 07:01.920\nthat little game where you make a little farm, and she's like, oh, so you like Katie's farm,\n\n07:01.920 --> 07:02.920\nhuh?\n\n07:02.920 --> 07:03.920\nI'm like, what?\n\n07:03.920 --> 07:11.040\nIt's like, I, I click like and it tells everybody I know that I like to farm.\n\n07:11.040 --> 07:12.040\nThat's the fucking worst thing.\n\n07:12.040 --> 07:13.040\nYeah.\n\n07:13.040 --> 07:15.320\nI don't want to know about my Facebook Heyday paper trail.\n\n07:15.320 --> 07:21.120\nI mean, I'm proud of my candy crush paper trail, because I put a lot of fucking work\n\n07:21.120 --> 07:22.120\nin on that.\n\n07:22.120 --> 07:23.120\nDo you want help?\n\n07:23.120 --> 07:24.120\nDo you want help with your apple tree?\n\n07:24.120 --> 07:25.120\nUh, yeah.\n\n07:25.120 --> 07:26.120\nWell, fuck it.\n\n07:26.120 --> 07:27.120\nI want help with my apple tree.\n\n07:27.120 --> 07:34.320\nI don't know that that means that it's like, I don't know, just an old, no country for\n\n07:34.320 --> 07:39.200\nold men, this internet, um, it's just too goddamn busy and it changes too much.\n\n07:39.200 --> 07:41.960\nAnd I know it's like, it's just too much shit going on on it.\n\n07:41.960 --> 07:44.400\nAnd the pictures are always like, every time you try to look at pictures, it's different.\n\n07:44.400 --> 07:45.400\nYeah.\n\n07:45.400 --> 07:46.400\nI don't like it.\n\n07:46.400 --> 07:47.400\nYeah.\n\n07:47.400 --> 07:48.400\nAll right.\n\n07:48.400 --> 07:49.400\nFuck Facebook.\n\n07:49.400 --> 07:50.400\nThat's the conclusion.\n\n07:50.400 --> 07:51.400\nI don't need help with Facebook.\n\n07:51.400 --> 07:52.400\nFuck Facebook.\n\n07:52.400 --> 07:53.400\nFuck the movie about Facebook.\n\n07:53.400 --> 07:54.400\nI like that movie.\n\n07:54.400 --> 07:55.400\nThat's a good movie.\n\n07:55.400 --> 07:56.400\nNo.\n\n07:56.400 --> 07:57.400\nFuck you.\n\n07:57.400 --> 07:58.400\nOh, okay.\n\n07:58.400 --> 07:59.400\nThat's fine.\n\n07:59.400 --> 08:00.400\nThat's valid.\n\n08:00.400 --> 08:01.400\nAll right.\n\n08:01.400 --> 08:04.760\nSo here's the, here's the last, here's the second and last item in this segment that\n\n08:04.760 --> 08:05.760\nI need help with.\n\n08:05.760 --> 08:06.760\nWhat was it?\n\n08:06.760 --> 08:07.760\nHelp myself?\n\n08:07.760 --> 08:08.760\nHelp me help you?\n\n08:08.760 --> 08:09.760\nHelp me help myself.\n\n08:09.760 --> 08:10.760\nI came up with that on the fly.\n\n08:10.760 --> 08:17.360\nI'd say it's a take on the help me help you from Jerry McDoodles.\n\n08:17.360 --> 08:21.960\nSo, so when you, when you get it, when you get an Uber, a lot of my, a lot of my time\n\n08:21.960 --> 08:27.040\nis spent in Ubers now, Uber, Uber, Uber cars, the non-taxi get a ride.\n\n08:27.040 --> 08:36.640\nSo one of the things that makes it a non-taxi ride is the compulsive insistence of the driver\n\n08:36.640 --> 08:46.200\non opening the door for you and it's especially annoying upon arrival because it truly slows\n\n08:46.200 --> 08:52.720\nyou down that you pull up and they, you know, okay, we're here and he's like scrambling.\n\n08:52.720 --> 08:56.600\nIt's, it's, it's, it's, they, they tell them or something.\n\n08:56.600 --> 08:59.080\nSomeone's telling people you have to open the door for them.\n\n08:59.080 --> 09:04.040\nThat's what makes it not a cab and it's, I keep, I, I, sometimes I have success by\n\n09:04.040 --> 09:09.560\ngoing like, I got the door, it's fine and they're like, fuck, okay.\n\n09:09.560 --> 09:13.360\nBut like, you have to like assert yourself, you have to like deny someone something and\n\n09:13.360 --> 09:17.160\nif you don't, if you just go with the flow, it's the most ridiculous thing in the world.\n\n09:17.160 --> 09:25.920\nYou pull up to a thing, a yogurt bin, wherever you're going and not the one close by your\n\n09:25.920 --> 09:29.120\nhouse that you could walk to, the one that, the good one that you have to get a ride to.\n\n09:29.120 --> 09:34.160\nThe Crosstown Yogurt Bin, the, over by the bazaar, you don't want to take your own car\n\n09:34.160 --> 09:36.280\nthere because you know how the parking is at the Crosstown Yogurt Bin.\n\n09:36.280 --> 09:41.120\nI'm going to drive it back drunk on yogurt through all those Burbank cops.\n\n09:41.120 --> 09:42.120\nThat's what they're waiting for.\n\n09:42.120 --> 09:48.120\nThere's like three, three cops right outside the yogurt bin, like, we're going to get them.\n\n09:48.120 --> 09:51.120\nYou pull up and then it's just, it's just, I don't know, what do you, what do you do?\n\n09:51.120 --> 09:55.640\nI would say here, I will, I will give this advice to you if I could help you help yourself\n\n09:55.640 --> 09:56.640\non this one.\n\n09:56.640 --> 10:00.460\nYou're going to start taking Ubers everywhere and you're going to be, you're going to keep\n\n10:00.460 --> 10:04.600\ngetting out of the backseat of a car and opened by a gentleman.\n\n10:04.600 --> 10:05.600\nOwn it.\n\n10:05.600 --> 10:06.600\nYou want me to own it.\n\n10:06.600 --> 10:11.960\nStart wearing long white fur coats and, and, and like, and, and like a nylon stockings\n\n10:11.960 --> 10:15.120\nand like, kind of put my leg out so it's sort of the camera can pan up.\n\n10:15.120 --> 10:16.120\nThere you are.\n\n10:16.120 --> 10:17.120\nYeah.\n\n10:17.120 --> 10:18.120\nStart doing some upskirts.\n\n10:18.120 --> 10:21.320\nLike some, some, some nip slips, like really fucking get, like give us something.\n\n10:21.320 --> 10:22.320\nAll right.\n\n10:22.320 --> 10:23.320\nI'll just make it worth our while.\n\n10:23.320 --> 10:25.640\nI'll get like a prop poodle.\n\n10:25.640 --> 10:26.640\nYeah.\n\n10:26.640 --> 10:29.440\nThe, the, the high heel shoes with the goldfish and the thing.\n\n10:29.440 --> 10:30.440\nYeah.\n\n10:30.440 --> 10:31.440\nLet me like do the whole thing.\n\n10:31.440 --> 10:32.440\nI'll just always have shopping bags with me.\n\n10:32.440 --> 10:35.440\nSee, that might be useful if I get a bunch of shit.\n\n10:35.440 --> 10:36.440\nI don't know.\n\n10:36.440 --> 10:37.440\nAll right.\n\n10:37.440 --> 10:48.440\nUh, my next segment is, uh, is called, uh, uh, Starbound, a video game I'm playing.\n\n10:48.440 --> 10:49.440\nStarbound's great.\n\n10:49.440 --> 10:50.920\nIt's a great video game.\n\n10:50.920 --> 10:51.920\nAll right.\n\n10:51.920 --> 10:52.920\nThat was it?\n\n10:52.920 --> 10:53.920\nYep.\n\n10:53.920 --> 10:54.920\nWait, Dan.\n\n10:54.920 --> 10:55.920\nUh-huh.\n\n10:55.920 --> 10:58.080\nYou just learned how to help yourself.\n\n10:58.080 --> 10:59.680\nYou didn't need us to help you on that one.\n\n10:59.680 --> 11:00.680\nNo, no, no.\n\n11:00.680 --> 11:02.480\nThat's the, that's the, that's the old segment.\n\n11:02.480 --> 11:03.480\nI know.\n\n11:03.480 --> 11:04.480\nOh.\n\n11:04.480 --> 11:05.480\nThat was the two different segments.\n\n11:05.480 --> 11:06.480\nOkay.\n\n11:06.480 --> 11:09.280\nWell, I mean, like I was just excited that you, that you've already like, you went from\n\n11:09.280 --> 11:11.280\nhelplessness to completely activated.\n\n11:11.280 --> 11:12.280\nOh, no, no.\n\n11:12.280 --> 11:13.280\nYeah.\n\n11:13.280 --> 11:14.720\nI only need help with the Ubers and the Facebook.\n\n11:14.720 --> 11:16.120\nI, Starbound, I'm good.\n\n11:16.120 --> 11:17.120\nIt's great.\n\n11:17.120 --> 11:18.120\nIt's a great game.\n\n11:18.120 --> 11:19.120\nDid you give up on your, on your eye Harmon?\n\n11:19.120 --> 11:20.840\nThat you're not, I mean, you gave up on it pretty quickly.\n\n11:20.840 --> 11:21.840\nYeah.\n\n11:21.840 --> 11:22.840\nI gave up.\n\n11:22.840 --> 11:23.840\nYep.\n\n11:23.840 --> 11:24.840\nYeah.\n\n11:24.840 --> 11:29.000\nBut, or high and hard, what was the deciding factor on no more notepads around your neck?\n\n11:29.000 --> 11:31.240\nI just can't, it just wasn't working.\n\n11:31.240 --> 11:37.480\nIt just doesn't, if I have a, I'm using a new kind of app that works with Evernote that\n\n11:37.480 --> 11:41.720\nmy friend Kevin Day recommended to me.\n\n11:41.720 --> 11:49.080\nIt's called EverMemo and all it does is it just lets you put in a memo and it puts it\n\n11:49.080 --> 11:51.360\ninto Evernote for you.\n\n11:51.360 --> 11:55.880\nYeah, it kind of, does it, does Evernote roll its eyes when that happens?\n\n11:55.880 --> 12:00.480\nI think, I think Evernote is like, is he, is he still using Evernote?\n\n12:00.480 --> 12:04.120\nLike, we got him, like, like, yeah, it's kind of built on top of Evernote.\n\n12:04.120 --> 12:05.120\nI don't get it anymore.\n\n12:05.120 --> 12:07.120\nI don't like, just kill myself.\n\n12:07.120 --> 12:11.640\nJust give me an app that's just like a rope that I can just kill myself on.\n\n12:11.640 --> 12:15.080\nI just, you actually, keyboard doesn't work anymore, you can't type anymore.\n\n12:15.080 --> 12:17.960\nThey're just, they're just weeding people like me out, man.\n\n12:17.960 --> 12:22.040\nFor a while, you had the affectation of carrying around the little magnetic ball chain thing\n\n12:22.040 --> 12:25.840\nthat you can make little shapes and stuff and you were like, you were like a cute little\n\n12:25.840 --> 12:32.440\nlike savant baby at the restaurant and nobody bothered you because you were clearly making\n\n12:32.440 --> 12:33.440\na cube.\n\n12:33.440 --> 12:34.440\nIt looked weird, yeah.\n\n12:34.440 --> 12:35.440\nYeah.\n\n12:35.440 --> 12:37.320\nIt looked like I could strangle you with it.\n\n12:37.320 --> 12:39.680\nUm, anyways, I'm still looking at this.\n\n12:39.680 --> 12:40.800\nThere's only one more thing on it.\n\n12:40.800 --> 12:42.440\nI don't like Southwest Airlines.\n\n12:42.440 --> 12:47.880\nI don't, uh, we went to Sketch Fest and I, I, I don't like this first come first\n\n12:47.880 --> 12:48.880\nserve seating thing.\n\n12:48.880 --> 12:53.280\nI don't like the weird combination between that and the, uh, you're in section A we're\n\n12:53.280 --> 12:54.280\ngoing to call.\n\n12:54.280 --> 12:55.640\nI don't, I don't, I don't get it.\n\n12:55.640 --> 12:58.080\nI don't, no one likes to get on an airplane.\n\n12:58.080 --> 12:59.560\nNobody likes air travel.\n\n12:59.560 --> 13:04.280\nUh, they, they, they just, they cram you into this little tube.\n\n13:04.280 --> 13:05.360\nYou might die.\n\n13:05.360 --> 13:09.520\nI know that you're more likely to die in the freeway, but you're also more likely to die\n\n13:09.520 --> 13:11.320\nby your own hand on the freeway.\n\n13:11.320 --> 13:15.520\nLike you must, you're more likely to have the satisfaction of skidding into another guy\n\n13:15.520 --> 13:19.520\nmaking eye contact with them before you get decapitated and both of you going like, fuck\n\n13:19.520 --> 13:20.520\nyou.\n\n13:20.520 --> 13:24.440\nOr, or just like, or just like, oh shit.\n\n13:24.440 --> 13:26.120\nLike on an airplane, it's just, fuck it.\n\n13:26.120 --> 13:30.080\nThere's just some coped up Denzel Washington in the cockpit and you know, you're flying\n\n13:30.080 --> 13:31.080\nupside down.\n\n13:31.080 --> 13:32.080\nCause you hit turbulence.\n\n13:32.080 --> 13:33.080\nYou don't know what's going on.\n\n13:33.080 --> 13:34.080\nThey could get over the thing.\n\n13:34.080 --> 13:35.080\nAre they telling you the truth or not?\n\n13:35.080 --> 13:36.760\nIs this some asshole up there?\n\n13:36.760 --> 13:41.680\nLike some gas holes all around you, bossing you around, put your phone in airplane mode.\n\n13:41.680 --> 13:42.680\nYou can use it now.\n\n13:42.680 --> 13:43.680\nYou can't use it.\n\n13:43.680 --> 13:44.680\nHey, by the way.\n\n13:44.680 --> 13:51.120\nI had my phone out of airplane mode the whole time.\n\n13:51.120 --> 13:52.620\nScience experiment over.\n\n13:52.620 --> 13:54.120\nThe plane doesn't crash.\n\n13:54.120 --> 13:56.200\nIt's done with this fucking garbage.\n\n13:56.200 --> 13:59.440\nI know they just changed the rules so now you can actually, ooh, you can have the things\n\n13:59.440 --> 14:02.400\non, but also what the fuck, why are they always bossing you around?\n\n14:02.400 --> 14:08.960\nWhy is everything a fucking caveat and a disclaimer items may have shifted in the thing.\n\n14:08.960 --> 14:16.240\nWhat fucking asshole got knocked out by a duffel bag in 1938 that we all have to listen\n\n14:16.240 --> 14:20.560\nto, you know, the amount of time put together that we've all had to listen to that fucking\n\n14:20.560 --> 14:23.520\nwarning about how items may have shifted.\n\n14:23.520 --> 14:24.680\nWhat the fuck is going on?\n\n14:24.680 --> 14:26.160\nHave you ever seen an item shift?\n\n14:26.160 --> 14:28.040\nHave you ever seen anything fall out?\n\n14:28.040 --> 14:29.680\nHas anyone ever gotten hurt?\n\n14:29.680 --> 14:35.320\nObviously one person did and they're so worried about that $15,000 lawsuit that for fucking\n\n14:35.320 --> 14:39.680\n50 years they've been telling you about the item shifting, I just, I just hate them.\n\n14:39.680 --> 14:40.680\nI hate them.\n\n14:40.680 --> 14:41.680\nI hate them.\n\n14:41.680 --> 14:42.680\nWhat?\n\n14:42.680 --> 14:43.680\nWhat?\n\n14:43.680 --> 14:44.680\nWhat?\n\n14:44.680 --> 14:46.160\nWho's Billy Mays guy?\n\n14:46.160 --> 14:48.200\nBilly Mays died.\n\n14:48.200 --> 14:49.200\nThe baseball player.\n\n14:49.200 --> 14:54.000\nFirst of all, I can't, this lady means I can't see you.\n\n14:54.000 --> 14:59.160\nOh yeah, the, the, the, the cookie and infomercial guy, the ShamWow or whatever the hell, not\n\n14:59.160 --> 15:01.480\nthe ShamWow guy, but the oxy clean.\n\n15:01.480 --> 15:05.680\nHe died by item shiftage in the overhead compartments.\n\n15:05.680 --> 15:09.400\nNo, he died because his heart exploded from cocaine.\n\n15:09.400 --> 15:12.800\nI mean, and also, but not only did you do that, Adam, but before you did it, I think\n\n15:12.800 --> 15:13.800\nyou went, really?\n\n15:13.800 --> 15:18.280\nLike, like, like you were incredulous about mid rant.\n\n15:18.280 --> 15:21.160\nYou did fucking rant is, uh, interruptus.\n\n15:21.160 --> 15:22.160\nYeah.\n\n15:22.160 --> 15:27.040\nI have, I have blue rant now.\n\n15:27.040 --> 15:33.360\nMy outrage just numb, hurts, someone's gotta give me a, gonna massage me with their hand\n\n15:33.360 --> 15:37.640\nuntil I'm angry about something again.\n\n15:37.640 --> 15:39.680\nI wish you all could have been up there for the show.\n\n15:39.680 --> 15:43.400\nWe did a couple nights ago in San Francisco where a fellow named Jeremy came out on stage\n\n15:43.400 --> 15:46.040\nand then shit went just straight up.\n\n15:46.040 --> 15:47.040\nWell, they've heard it by now.\n\n15:47.040 --> 15:51.080\nThey're, I mean, like, but, but Neil Brook, the guy that's shooting into the documentary,\n\n15:51.080 --> 15:52.880\nsaid like, I hated that Eva girl.\n\n15:52.880 --> 15:56.760\nAnd I was like, you wouldn't have, if you saw her, you would have hated the guy more.\n\n15:56.760 --> 15:57.760\nOh yeah.\n\n15:57.760 --> 15:58.760\nThere's a thing that you don't visit.\n\n15:58.760 --> 16:04.440\nThere's an oral versus visual experience you have with podcasts and live shows where, um,\n\n16:04.440 --> 16:07.440\nnobody really had a problem with her that I could, I mean, maybe somebody did.\n\n16:07.440 --> 16:10.560\nBut as one, the audience instantly didn't like that guy.\n\n16:10.560 --> 16:15.200\nAnd it was, and it was, it wasn't because he, you know, was, was wearing like a KKK outfit.\n\n16:15.200 --> 16:19.000\nLike he was just, he was, I would qualify that and say, well, as I said up there, I\n\n16:19.000 --> 16:22.480\ndon't, I don't know how many people didn't actually decided that they didn't, they didn't\n\n16:22.480 --> 16:23.480\nlike him.\n\n16:23.480 --> 16:28.880\nAnd I think that like a vast majority of people suddenly decided that they didn't believe\n\n16:28.880 --> 16:29.880\nhim.\n\n16:29.880 --> 16:30.880\nYeah.\n\n16:30.880 --> 16:32.720\nBut then, but then what, when it was like, well, it's, maybe he's just awkward or maybe\n\n16:32.720 --> 16:37.000\njust this, but then it was just like, boo, I think that at some point they just would\n\n16:37.000 --> 16:39.200\nrather him not have been up there or whatever.\n\n16:39.200 --> 16:40.200\nYeah.\n\n16:40.200 --> 16:41.200\nI don't know.\n\n16:41.200 --> 16:42.600\nI think if they all went out and had a drink with him after the show, like everything might\n\n16:42.600 --> 16:47.920\nhave been fine, but just as far as the moment somebody came up on stage and made it onto\n\n16:47.920 --> 16:52.280\nthe stage, that person ceased to be one of them and became somebody that they wanted\n\n16:52.280 --> 16:53.920\nnot up there as best paying customers.\n\n16:53.920 --> 16:54.920\nYeah.\n\n16:54.920 --> 16:57.320\nI think everybody, everybody that comes to a harm attack show, they go like, you know,\n\n16:57.320 --> 16:59.200\nthey like the fact that somebody can come up.\n\n16:59.200 --> 17:03.680\nThey like that experience, but that person owes a lot to the audience because the audience\n\n17:03.680 --> 17:08.800\nis sitting there thinking, I paid $10 to, I'd love to be on stage, maybe, maybe not.\n\n17:08.800 --> 17:10.880\nBut in either case, I'm not coming up there.\n\n17:10.880 --> 17:12.640\nSo what the fuck are you doing up there?\n\n17:12.640 --> 17:14.400\nAnd you better, you better make it good.\n\n17:14.400 --> 17:19.120\nAnd I think people are less prone to feel that way when they're listening to the podcast\n\n17:19.120 --> 17:23.000\nthan when they're sitting in the audience because they waited in line, et cetera, and\n\n17:23.000 --> 17:26.600\nthey can, pheromones and visuals, body language.\n\n17:26.600 --> 17:30.160\nThat's why that phenomenon of like in the early days, it was like, Adam Goldberg, do\n\n17:30.160 --> 17:32.440\nyou love him or hate him?\n\n17:32.440 --> 17:36.560\nIs he a hamburger or a hero?\n\n17:36.560 --> 17:40.440\nAnd I think it seemed like people that listened to the podcast were like, I don't mind Adam\n\n17:40.440 --> 17:41.440\nGoldberg.\n\n17:41.440 --> 17:42.440\nHe's fine.\n\n17:42.440 --> 17:43.440\nYeah.\n\n17:43.440 --> 17:45.520\nCause he's like coming through one channel and, and you're just, you're just chopping\n\n17:45.520 --> 17:50.600\ncarrots and he's not fucking with that.\n\n17:50.600 --> 17:53.080\nBut you come, there's a difference if you're sitting in the crowd.\n\n17:53.080 --> 17:57.240\nBut here, you, you know that if, if you were chopping carrots and he could fuck with that,\n\n17:57.240 --> 17:58.240\nhe would.\n\n17:58.240 --> 18:01.680\nIt's been a long time since we talked to Adam Goldberg, isn't it?\n\n18:01.680 --> 18:04.520\nShould we just bring him up and just like, like, let's just talk to him.\n\n18:04.520 --> 18:12.160\nAdam, Adam, get up on stage, you little devil.\n\n18:12.160 --> 18:17.400\nThe crowd goes mild, I love it.\n\n18:17.400 --> 18:20.920\nThe ever increasingly tepid applause of bringing you up on stage.\n\n18:20.920 --> 18:21.920\nFine.\n\n18:21.920 --> 18:22.920\nIt's fine.\n\n18:22.920 --> 18:26.720\nIt's the, the joke was stale a year and a half ago and I'm fine.\n\n18:26.720 --> 18:30.280\nYou, so you hate stale premises?\n\n18:30.280 --> 18:32.000\nI'm reinventing this premise.\n\n18:32.000 --> 18:33.000\nYou know what?\n\n18:33.000 --> 18:37.640\nIn the last year, I got an O from, I'm reinventing myself with this.\n\n18:37.640 --> 18:39.800\nYou haven't been up here long enough to start judging people yet.\n\n18:39.800 --> 18:41.600\nNo, you're right.\n\n18:41.600 --> 18:42.600\nIt's fair point.\n\n18:42.600 --> 18:47.560\nAlso you, and not to derail a derailment, but you, she made one little sound that was\n\n18:47.560 --> 18:51.480\nthe sound of enjoying a show and you, you have been for the last 10 minutes, you go\n\n18:51.480 --> 18:52.480\nlike.\n\n18:52.480 --> 18:54.480\nI can hear you.\n\n18:54.480 --> 18:55.480\nRobbo, Robbo.\n\n18:55.480 --> 18:56.480\nYes.\n\n18:56.480 --> 18:58.280\nI, I, I, and it, it bumps me.\n\n18:58.280 --> 19:04.160\nIt means I've been rooting for you and Grimace for a long time.\n\n19:04.160 --> 19:10.480\nRobbo, Robbo, but yeah, he did die from a, he was, he died because a bunch of junk fell\n\n19:10.480 --> 19:11.840\non him in an airplane.\n\n19:11.840 --> 19:13.640\nThat's not true.\n\n19:13.640 --> 19:19.280\nFox News, Fox News, the local Fox News says it's true, not Fox News, the international\n\n19:19.280 --> 19:20.280\none.\n\n19:20.280 --> 19:23.000\nI would say his, his, his publicist wants you to think that's true.\n\n19:23.000 --> 19:28.120\nThat'd be the most, the worst day as a publicist where you have to be like, how did he die?\n\n19:28.120 --> 19:29.120\nHe was unpacking his suitcase.\n\n19:29.120 --> 19:34.120\nI don't know how he died, but if he died because an item fell on him, it was a kilo of cocaine\n\n19:34.120 --> 19:37.600\nand it fell into his nostril.\n\n19:37.600 --> 19:41.880\nI would like to see, that's a, I don't know if myth, myth busters should address that.\n\n19:41.880 --> 19:47.440\nLike how, like, can you create a situation where items shift enough in an overhead compartment\n\n19:47.440 --> 19:52.600\nthat, you know, how much damage can you do to a human being that's unwarned, you know,\n\n19:52.600 --> 19:57.600\nand then the most important part is, now let's warn them and see what fucking changes.\n\n19:57.600 --> 20:00.440\nBecause what are we, am I, am I Neo for the Matrix?\n\n20:00.440 --> 20:04.560\nIf I know that the items have shifted, I'm going to like do a back bend and it's going\n\n20:04.560 --> 20:09.000\nto bullet time over my shoulder, and what the hell is up there?\n\n20:09.000 --> 20:10.960\nOh, how fast is it traveling?\n\n20:10.960 --> 20:11.960\nWhat the fuck is that?\n\n20:11.960 --> 20:13.760\nThose things open like DeLorean doors.\n\n20:13.760 --> 20:15.560\nThey open like the gold wings.\n\n20:15.560 --> 20:16.760\nWhat's going to jump out?\n\n20:16.760 --> 20:21.320\nLike a fucking, does somebody have a, have a, have the monster from basket case in there?\n\n20:21.320 --> 20:32.600\nIs it a, is it a, is it a, is it a critter from the, from the joke one guy got?\n\n20:32.600 --> 20:38.600\nThat was a, that was a Kumail laugh from the Roger Corman classic, right?\n\n20:38.600 --> 20:42.280\nIs that just Kumail digging the shove in the background?\n\n20:42.280 --> 20:44.120\nI didn't want to give you blue rant in the middle there.\n\n20:44.120 --> 20:45.120\nAll right.\n\n20:45.120 --> 20:46.120\nWell, sorry.\n\n20:46.120 --> 20:47.120\nIt was the creature from Critter.\n\n20:47.120 --> 20:48.120\nOkay.\n\n20:48.120 --> 20:49.120\nSo Adam, how, how are you doing?\n\n20:49.120 --> 20:50.120\nWhat, what are you doing vocationally?\n\n20:50.120 --> 20:52.080\nI started, I started my own business.\n\n20:52.080 --> 20:56.200\nI do search engine strategy and optimization.\n\n20:56.200 --> 21:01.360\nI make sure online stores actually sell things when they want to, which is important when\n\n21:01.360 --> 21:03.720\npeople only go to one website to buy things.\n\n21:03.720 --> 21:06.040\nHoney, so, so, so Target comes to you.\n\n21:06.040 --> 21:07.040\nI wish Target.\n\n21:07.040 --> 21:09.040\nI know they don't, but let's say Target comes to you.\n\n21:09.040 --> 21:13.400\nSomeone opened this, it's like a, like a fishing expo in Minnesota and they're like, ah, people\n\n21:13.400 --> 21:14.960\naren't buying enough fishing lures.\n\n21:14.960 --> 21:17.040\nWe got 3% of customers buying them.\n\n21:17.040 --> 21:18.200\nCan you get that up to six?\n\n21:18.200 --> 21:19.200\nI'm like, yes.\n\n21:19.200 --> 21:23.200\nSo you look at the things that happen when you Google fishing lures and you see, and\n\n21:23.200 --> 21:28.920\nyou, you, you, what do you, I changed websites so that they, people aren't like, ah, I guess\n\n21:28.920 --> 21:30.560\nI don't need a fishing lure.\n\n21:30.560 --> 21:32.040\nMaybe the ones I have are good.\n\n21:32.040 --> 21:36.640\nI don't want to click through 15 different pages as opposed to like getting coffee for\n\n21:36.640 --> 21:42.040\npeople and driving RVs badly, which was the last year of my life and producing that shark\n\n21:42.040 --> 21:47.680\nmovie, which everyone, I got fired from it two days after talking about being on it here.\n\n21:47.680 --> 21:52.840\nAnd everyone got carbon monoxide poisoning because they rented cheap trailers.\n\n21:52.840 --> 21:58.880\nAnd are you, are you still under investigation for that?\n\n21:58.880 --> 22:01.600\nHave police eliminated you as, as a possible suspect?\n\n22:01.600 --> 22:05.040\nWell, they, they Googled Adam Goldberg culpable monoxide.\n\n22:05.040 --> 22:06.040\nYeah.\n\n22:06.040 --> 22:07.040\nNothing came out.\n\n22:07.040 --> 22:10.640\nThey just saw a lovely fishing lure and they're like, all right, let's all go fishing.\n\n22:10.640 --> 22:12.720\nHe seems a little short to be on the Vikings.\n\n22:12.720 --> 22:17.000\nI don't think that's, no, Hulk Hogan's daughter was like, this script is below me.\n\n22:17.000 --> 22:18.160\nI'm not going to do it.\n\n22:18.160 --> 22:22.480\nAnd then I got fired and then they kept making the movie and then I was unfired and then\n\n22:22.480 --> 22:23.680\nI was refired.\n\n22:23.680 --> 22:27.840\nIt was just like continual panic attacks.\n\n22:27.840 --> 22:31.960\nSo when you see a shitty shark movie, it's not because they weren't trying.\n\n22:31.960 --> 22:35.920\nIt's because one person was trying and everyone else wasn't.\n\n22:35.920 --> 22:38.680\nYou were the guy that was trying your side.\n\n22:38.680 --> 22:39.680\nI was.\n\n22:39.680 --> 22:44.480\nWe had, we're splitting an internet connection eight ways and I was hired into a position\n\n22:44.480 --> 22:50.760\ntwo levels above my competency, which at the time it was minimal, but this was, hey\n\n22:50.760 --> 22:55.120\nAdam, you've, you've been in charge of dozens of dollars before.\n\n22:55.120 --> 22:56.120\nWhere are we shooting?\n\n22:56.120 --> 22:57.120\nI don't know.\n\n22:57.120 --> 22:58.120\nI don't know.\n\n22:58.120 --> 22:59.120\nWhat was the, what was your position on the shark movie?\n\n22:59.120 --> 23:00.680\nI was production coordinator.\n\n23:00.680 --> 23:02.280\nI thought it was going to be a decision.\n\n23:02.280 --> 23:04.480\nUh, it was, no, it was production manager.\n\n23:04.480 --> 23:08.080\nI thought it was getting hired on as associate, uh, PC.\n\n23:08.080 --> 23:10.880\nIs this you just nailing a phony baloney resume or?\n\n23:10.880 --> 23:14.760\nI was like, Hey, my friend's making a skiing movie.\n\n23:14.760 --> 23:15.760\nYou want to do it?\n\n23:15.760 --> 23:17.760\nLike, I guess I'm not doing anything.\n\n23:17.760 --> 23:19.760\nHey, production manager.\n\n23:19.760 --> 23:25.160\nI'm like, no, no, no, no, no, no, I don't know.\n\n23:25.160 --> 23:26.160\nI don't want to, I don't want to.\n\n23:26.160 --> 23:30.320\nYou know, you are anything, but I just, you, you, you have a, you have a, you're a mover\n\n23:30.320 --> 23:31.320\nand a shaker.\n\n23:31.320 --> 23:35.160\nI got a feeling you ended up in a situation where you were over your head by your own\n\n23:35.160 --> 23:36.160\ndesign.\n\n23:36.160 --> 23:38.160\nYou got, you got what you bargained for.\n\n23:38.160 --> 23:39.960\nIt's like I got more than I bargained for.\n\n23:39.960 --> 23:43.640\nYou slip into the back doors of limos and you're like, yeah, I know Ben Vereen.\n\n23:43.640 --> 23:46.720\nLike, like, like, you just kind of like Ben Vereen.\n\n23:46.720 --> 23:51.840\nIs that like a, for those keeping track of it, I'm Quincy and Ben Vereen are the, are\n\n23:51.840 --> 23:56.800\nthey, are they, are they, are they, are they owning my age?\n\n23:56.800 --> 23:58.880\nYou got, you got, you know, when, when you read Salinger, you probably have to look\n\n23:58.880 --> 23:59.880\nshit up too.\n\n23:59.880 --> 24:00.880\nHe's worth it.\n\n24:00.880 --> 24:01.880\nWow.\n\n24:01.880 --> 24:02.880\nObscura.\n\n24:02.880 --> 24:03.880\nI can't do it.\n\n24:03.880 --> 24:10.640\nWe just got, we just got, we just got defensively hyroated on the Ben Vereen reference.\n\n24:10.640 --> 24:15.160\nNothing would be worse than me than your uncle, your uncle trying to be like, what's going\n\n24:15.160 --> 24:16.160\non with Pokemon?\n\n24:16.160 --> 24:19.400\nThere's so many Pokemon now.\n\n24:19.400 --> 24:23.360\nI can't, I feel old when I was like, it used to be not very many Pokemon.\n\n24:23.360 --> 24:26.240\nNow there are very many Pokemon.\n\n24:26.240 --> 24:27.640\nIt's, you got to catch them all, right?\n\n24:27.640 --> 24:28.640\nI can't.\n\n24:28.640 --> 24:29.640\nI want it to.\n\n24:29.640 --> 24:30.640\nI don't have, I run a business now.\n\n24:30.640 --> 24:32.480\nI got to hire someone to catch my Pokemon.\n\n24:32.480 --> 24:33.480\nAll right.\n\n24:33.480 --> 24:36.720\nLet's have a historic happy ending for an Adam Goldberg appearance and, and, and thank\n\n24:36.720 --> 24:37.720\nhim for coming up.\n\n24:37.720 --> 24:38.720\nThank you.\n\n24:38.720 --> 24:39.720\nAdam Goldberg.\n\n24:39.720 --> 24:40.720\nThank you, brother.\n\n24:40.720 --> 24:48.240\nI have, I would have had more questions for him, but we have, we have a lot of talent\n\n24:48.240 --> 24:49.240\nin the show tonight.\n\n24:49.240 --> 24:50.240\nThere's too much show tonight.\n\n24:50.240 --> 24:51.240\nToo much show.\n\n24:51.240 --> 24:52.240\nThere's too much show.\n\n24:52.240 --> 24:53.240\nNot enough time.\n\n24:53.240 --> 24:54.240\nToo much, too much energy.\n\n24:54.240 --> 24:55.720\nToo much, too much entertainment in store for them.\n\n24:55.720 --> 24:56.720\nYeah.\n\n24:56.720 --> 24:58.520\nThey're going to, it's going to be coming up over the top.\n\n24:58.520 --> 24:59.840\nThere's going to be a meniscus.\n\n24:59.840 --> 25:01.840\nI think that our, our show, the amount of show.\n\n25:01.840 --> 25:05.440\nThey're going to have to go like this on the top of the show before they carry it to the\n\n25:05.440 --> 25:06.440\ntable.\n\n25:06.440 --> 25:09.520\nIf you try to pick the show up across the table, it's going to end up in your lap.\n\n25:09.520 --> 25:10.520\nYeah.\n\n25:10.520 --> 25:12.280\nYou're going to have to, as gross as it is for your friends, you're going to have to\n\n25:12.280 --> 25:15.560\nslurp from the top of the, of the show before you give it to them.\n\n25:15.560 --> 25:19.960\nAnd I think that our show naturally counter balances the lack of lighting that we have\n\n25:19.960 --> 25:20.960\nnow.\n\n25:20.960 --> 25:25.120\nI think we put, we put more show on the stage because it's just the one autopsy light.\n\n25:25.120 --> 25:28.520\nThe weird, the weird secondary effect of this diffuse kind of lighting that's made for\n\n25:28.520 --> 25:32.000\nshooting is that I can't see anybody in the audience as usual, except for everyone in\n\n25:32.000 --> 25:35.680\nthe front row who are lit like the, the Kryptonian tribunal.\n\n25:35.680 --> 25:36.680\nExactly.\n\n25:36.680 --> 25:43.040\nThey look like they're going to, they're going to sentence me to the phantom zone or be sentenced\n\n25:43.040 --> 25:44.040\nto the phantom zone.\n\n25:44.040 --> 25:47.760\nI don't know, it was the same thing in San Francisco and comedy club.\n\n25:47.760 --> 25:50.520\nThere was this balcony and all the people were strangely lit in the front row of the\n\n25:50.520 --> 25:51.520\nbalcony.\n\n25:51.520 --> 25:53.820\nThere were these people sitting above you.\n\n25:53.820 --> 25:54.820\nYeah.\n\n25:54.820 --> 25:57.820\nCan we, can we, I'll get up here.\n\n25:57.820 --> 26:00.820\nHave a question for you.\n\n26:00.820 --> 26:04.960\nYou just, can we have Nanjiani everybody.\n\n26:04.960 --> 26:05.960\nWhat have you wrought?\n\n26:05.960 --> 26:08.260\nHey, how's it going?\n\n26:08.260 --> 26:12.240\nBecause it's lit this way because of the good news that you're shooting your comedy\n\n26:12.240 --> 26:17.520\nFufu laser laser bomb show we're doing the comedy Fufu laser bomb show for\n\n26:17.520 --> 26:20.920\nComedy Central now we're doing the meltdown which I host with Jonah Ray\n\n26:20.920 --> 26:26.320\nevery week and we're doing it for TV so I apologize we're doing the hacky\n\n26:26.320 --> 26:29.640\nriffing the set thing and we did it poorly and it's right no it's great can\n\n26:29.640 --> 26:33.920\nI say something again I'm gonna piss I was talking to gorelly back there and I\n\n26:33.920 --> 26:39.880\nwas like it is if you're in a position to fire Adam Goldberg can you even bring\n\n26:39.880 --> 26:45.200\nyourself to not do it like and then gorelly said they probably hired him\n\n26:45.200 --> 26:48.800\nagain to fire him again\n\n26:49.800 --> 26:55.760\nlike if you could fire him from this how great would it feel no offense bro the\n\n26:55.760 --> 27:00.160\nthing is we the thing is theoretically we should be able to fire him but we can\n\n27:00.160 --> 27:04.560\nit felt like they didn't fire him enough it was like no one was great they were\n\n27:04.560 --> 27:08.320\nhaving a bad week they're like that day I fired Adam Goldberg I knew I did\n\n27:08.320 --> 27:13.080\nsomething right that day I think that's what heroin must be like it is this\n\n27:13.080 --> 27:17.060\nfeeling of serotonin pouring down my spine you're just trying to reclaim the\n\n27:17.060 --> 27:22.160\nfirst time you fired under under any pretext get him back in my office no\n\n27:22.160 --> 27:27.800\npeople don't know this but I gotta get that fix back yeah okay you fire Adam\n\n27:27.800 --> 27:30.560\nGoldberg in the beginning because it feels good then you just do it to feel\n\n27:30.560 --> 27:36.960\nlike yourself but you know but then you but then you're you're chasing that\n\n27:36.960 --> 27:42.080\ndragon it's never as good I can't even I can't even get through the day with\n\n27:42.080 --> 27:47.960\nthat fire falling asleep with the wheel and I only he done firing Adam Goldberg\n\n27:47.960 --> 27:54.000\nI died with a smile on my face the problem is he'd also be your drug dealer\n\n27:54.000 --> 27:59.080\nlike you lay on him to show up yeah I get that you have to hang out with him\n\n27:59.080 --> 28:06.900\nat a bar and shit I your segment is over Adam remember the happy\n\n28:06.900 --> 28:10.000\nending yeah I know I know we're just fucking with you because it's a little\n\n28:10.000 --> 28:14.240\npart of the fun event I did laugh at your critters reference because I love\n\n28:14.240 --> 28:16.880\nthat movie and though it was one of the first movies that Emily and I watched\n\n28:16.880 --> 28:22.240\ntogether critters yes it's sad as your brain dies the set was among the sad\n\n28:22.240 --> 28:26.520\nthings are that everything you're referencing this is me at 38 I would\n\n28:26.520 --> 28:29.600\nsay I was going like it's a bummer that everything in my brain that I used to\n\n28:29.600 --> 28:33.520\nmake a point is now absolutely unknown to most of the people that I'm talking to\n\n28:33.520 --> 28:38.320\nthe sadder thing is as you just witnessed at 41 I couldn't quite think of the\n\n28:38.320 --> 28:43.480\nword critters anymore now that's going away I should embrace that just become\n\n28:43.480 --> 28:48.360\n16 again and go like well well you know just get into fucking yeah lady boo boo\n\n28:48.360 --> 28:54.120\nor whatever they're listening to and like me it's an invitation lady boo boo I\n\n28:54.120 --> 28:57.000\nthink it's my league Gaga\n\n28:57.000 --> 29:02.800\nlady boo boo ironically or it's appropriate the only young hip reference\n\n29:02.800 --> 29:11.680\nyou know is the show you created that's the only and that's getting old no it's\n\n29:11.680 --> 29:15.400\nnot that's so it's good that it got old guys we spent it died young you would\n\n29:15.400 --> 29:17.720\nhave hated that set me a link I didn't get a chance to listen to it because in\n\n29:17.720 --> 29:21.640\nthe car that Ben Folds Ben Folds made a song about community or something miss\n\n29:21.640 --> 29:25.880\nlike what give me yeah no Ben Folds he did it yeah for the ass crack bandit\n\n29:25.880 --> 29:35.160\nepisode he did a really great low rent Leonard Cohen like a song like I got to\n\n29:35.160 --> 29:40.480\nI got to talk to Ben Folds on the phone and talk to him about the concept and\n\n29:40.480 --> 29:44.680\nthen he he did this thing and one of our writers Eric Summers just sent him like\n\n29:44.680 --> 29:50.680\n80 paragraphs of lyrics areas about dropping coins into\n\n29:50.680 --> 29:57.120\nass cracks and I think he literally put all of them into this incredibly\n\n29:57.120 --> 30:01.320\nshamefully toe-tapping song like it's just like it's got all these hooks to\n\n30:01.320 --> 30:05.320\nit and it's like it's about an ass crack bandit that puts quarters down your\n\n30:05.320 --> 30:12.400\nbutt and I but I I also I you know I jumped on the opportunity Aaron's a big\n\n30:12.400 --> 30:19.200\nfan of Ben Folds bigger bigger fan than me certainly a better fan than me and so\n\n30:19.200 --> 30:25.800\nI finagled an opportunity to go to dinner with him and and I would say I\n\n30:25.800 --> 30:30.800\ndon't think it's premature to say that that we're friends and that you invite\n\n30:30.800 --> 30:36.680\nAaron to yeah yeah yeah okay no but she's just sending her pictures of you\n\n30:36.680 --> 30:40.960\nguys hanging out the weird thing is that I think because and I don't want to\n\n30:40.960 --> 30:44.840\noveranalyze or suffocate this new relationship that I'm that is just\n\n30:44.840 --> 30:50.600\nblooming but I think that the fact that I know nothing about music and that and\n\n30:50.600 --> 30:54.040\nthat he doesn't really know he's not a writer like is allowing us to be really\n\n30:54.040 --> 30:57.920\npretentious with each other in texts and like instant messages and things so I\n\n30:57.920 --> 31:02.760\ncould go like what do you mean you're practicing your concerto and oh and he\n\n31:02.760 --> 31:06.560\ncan be like well he doesn't have to worry because he's not talking to Warren\n\n31:06.560 --> 31:15.640\nZevon or something and for a good reason Warren Zevon writing that down did\n\n31:15.640 --> 31:24.840\nyou die in 1976 that's burning up the charts right I thought that was a\n\n31:24.840 --> 31:28.440\npretty good stab at somebody that might intimidate Ben fold well he's dead but\n\n31:28.440 --> 31:35.680\nthat's right but I got you know let me just let me just yell out over your\n\n31:35.680 --> 31:40.760\nhaving fun mocking me I like I want to challenge you to see how obscure 70s\n\n31:40.760 --> 31:48.360\n80s you can go Warren Zevon is like is awesome yeah I was great he knew he was\n\n31:48.360 --> 31:51.840\ngonna die he got lung cancer and they were like you have like a couple months\n\n31:51.840 --> 31:55.600\nso he recorded his last album it's called the wind knowing he was gonna die\n\n31:55.600 --> 31:57.880\nand he's like all right well this is the last thing I'm gonna make and it's\n\n31:57.880 --> 32:02.640\nawesome it's full of joy and like really funny and he has like a bunch of his\n\n32:02.640 --> 32:06.160\nfriends on it Bruce Springsteen it's a fucking great album the wind wasn't do\n\n32:06.160 --> 32:12.080\nit who's the guy that that turned down that and that gig I think Ben fold's\n\n32:12.080 --> 32:19.200\nturned it down he was it had to be Gene Simmons right yeah no man kiss doesn't\n\n32:19.200 --> 32:26.680\nget the joke kiss doesn't relate to mortality kiss lives forever I don't\n\n32:26.680 --> 32:30.760\nunderstand what you say in your

point because I was also like I kept one of my other complaints\n\n37:36.160 --> 37:40.440\nabout Uber which I've now dropped was that you the whole appeal of this thing\n\n37:40.440 --> 37:44.200\nis that it's an app it's not a cab you hit a button they come get you they're\n\n37:44.200 --> 37:49.600\nlike a drone you know like like and and and and I kept complaining because every\n\n37:49.600 -->

a\n\n38:01.240 --> 38:05.440\nconversation between me and a cab driver at this point and and I was like\n\n38:05.440 --> 38:09.400\nwhy did why do they have to do that and then my friend Wade Randolph Rick and\n\n38:09.400 --> 38:13.640\nMorty writers said you know why they do that because in New York recently a\n\n38:13.640 --> 38:17.760\nNew Year's Eve there now it's like this is the thing about

they had a bunch of people just order lifts and\n\n38:45.240 --> 38:51.080\nsend them to look for it to remote locations where there was no passenger\n\n38:51.080 --> 38:55.760\nso the only person

my way people problems like complaints is by sticking up for the\n\n40:32.880 --> 40:35.800\nfucking man and say fuck the system then before I go home to my mansion and\n\n40:35.800 --> 40:42.040\njerk off into a laptop there was an article about some somebody went\n\n40:42.040 --> 40:45.720\nundercover and did that went to it went worked at Amazon at one of their\n\n40:45.720 --> 40:50.600\nwarehouses oh I heard about this yeah and I have this is all second hand I\n\n40:50.600 --> 40:55.360\ndon't read anything I get all my news from someone in a writer's room and I\n\n40:55.360 --> 40:59.400\njust trust them yeah but they were talking about this article this person\n\n40:59.400 --> 41:04.840\ngoes undercover and works for a while at Amazon and it and and describes it as\n\n41:04.840 --> 41:09.440\nbeing like this insane Orwellian prison where because the technology now allows\n\n41:09.440 --> 41:16.200\nthem to track their workers with with laser

how could this possibly be fair and I guess the\n\n41:32.520 --> 41:37.680\nanswer is just because well who money's changing hands and wake we're not someone\n\n41:37.680 --> 41:41.600\nwas telling me

jerk off questions we have we have follow-ups hi Matt Gorley Newsweek\n\n45:06.960 --> 45:17.360\nmagazine why to why why does it hurt to jerk off follow-up question why am I\n\n45:17.360 --> 45:22.400\nasking this I would I was I was being hyperbolic and thinking of the most\n\n45:22.400 --> 45:25.200\nridiculous thing that you can ever complain about would be it would be how\n\n45:25.200 --> 45:29.200\nmuch it hurts to jerk off because I ostensibly the answer the question would\n\n45:29.200 --> 45:33.760\nbe that you jerked off so much I haven't experienced this since I was like 21\n\n45:33.760 --> 45:38.000\nyeah where it's just like Sunday afternoon and you're just like more\n\n45:38.000 --> 45:42.160\nall right yeah I'd like to see the rest of my time to my distinguished

iPad again\n\n45:57.520 --> 46:01.600\nit's just it's all hyperbolic language and yeah but many a truth is said in\n\n46:01.600 --> 46:14.840\njust Dan well I mean you're a racist no Disneyland with their new ride did I\n\n46:14.840 --> 46:18.280\ndon't have any more shit he said he had four more I mean there was a pirate to\n\n46:18.280 --> 46:24.160\nthe Caribbean that I backed off on because it got weird what last month\n\n46:24.160 --> 46:31.800\nokay now it's getting too dark all right that's it wait why why why was why is\n\n46:31.800 --> 46:37.320\nthis Disneyland ranking like this is what I heard I don't know like like Dan I\n\n46:37.320 --> 46:42.160\nhear facts and then I take them to be true and then spread them and then add to\n\n46:42.160 --> 46:47.640\nthem and so just please cut out the stuff where I'm not sure about this just\n\n46:47.640 --> 46:52.680\nto just so that you see like oh I'm only 135 I gotta get up top and then there's\n\n46:52.680 --> 46:55.560\ncertain people who are go-getters who are like higher up so you like get a\n\n46:55.560 --> 46:59.440\nthing like like you were 200 today that's not good don't you want to be\n\n46:59.440 --> 47:03.000\nhigher than that like that kind of stuff do you know are they people voting for\n\n47:03.000 --> 47:06.880\neach other or no it's because they can track like how much work you've done and\n\n47:06.880 --> 47:10.480\nall this stuff but I mean how are they measuring and how are they comparing like\n\n47:10.480 --> 47:15.000\nthe guy that sells the ostrich legs to the guy that's running the roller\n\n47:15.000 --> 47:20.520\ncoaster okay I would have to go talk to the person who I don't I don't even\n\n47:20.520 --> 47:28.520\nremember who it was it could have been a dream I

internet like you get corrected on every little\n\n47:46.520 --> 47:50.320\nbloody thing I miss we misspeak all the time word you should try doing a James\n\n47:50.320 --> 47:54.560\nBond podcast those people do not let a thing go by what's it what's it called\n\n47:54.560 --> 47:58.040\nin James bonding James bonding yeah I can imagine they come after you with\n\n47:58.040 --> 48:01.440\nactually you should not try doing it but I will say this there's another side to\n\n48:01.440 --> 48:05.040\nthat culture like like it's like this emerging internet age I think I feel like\n\n48:05.040 --> 48:09.200\nReddit is the represents it the most like a personality wise you know every\n\n48:09.200 --> 48:12.720\nwe've talked about every social every social platform has its own personality\n\n48:12.720 --> 48:20.440\ntumblr is a is a very like a passionate young lady and and and reddit and\n\n48:20.440 --> 48:27.600\nreddit is a very stoic guy in a Vulcan costume who's who's playing 3d chess with\n\n48:27.600 --> 48:31.320\nwith someone and I didn't mean to get gender-specific there and but I'll\n\n48:31.320 --> 48:35.880\nhear about that on both of those platforms in very different ways yes one\n\n48:35.880 --> 48:44.720\nwith a both address it in their own way Instagram is a cat my account is but\n\n48:44.720 --> 48:49.640\nreddit reddit has it's like like like so so for instance of like like if I'm up\n\n48:49.640 --> 48:52.680\nhere spouting nonsense and I go like you know you hear what happened in\n\n48:52.680 --> 48:56.320\nColumbia all these five guys got chainsawed my cobra ate them and the\n\n48:56.320 --> 48:59.520\nAmazon was responsible and blah blah blah not I just blah blah blah and I'm\n\n48:59.520 --> 49:02.800\ndrunk and I go home and I sleep like a baby I get up and look on Twitter and\n\n49:02.800 --> 49:06.280\npeople correct me and there's there's a there's a curator personality that's\n\n49:06.280 --> 49:09.920\nhas a higher sense of social and informational responsibility these are\n\n49:09.920 --> 49:13.120\ngood people these are people who protect us historically from people like\n\n49:13.120 --> 49:16.720\nchurches that are gonna burn women it's at the stake and things like that it's\n\n49:16.720 --> 49:21.360\na logic skepticism and don't don't don't go off half-cocked and like like\n\n49:21.360 --> 49:28.280\nhowever and like the other side of that is this dumb Starbucks thing there's a\n\n49:28.280 --> 49:35.360\nI went to the reddit thread discussing dumb Starbucks well it was like it was\n\n49:35.360 --> 49:40.680\neight pages of just a bunch of people not able to have fun with like the\n\n49:40.680 --> 49:44.360\nsimplest thing in the world but I don't know what's going I think I think their\n\n49:44.360 --> 49:48.600\npoint is that privacy laws were overlaps with everybody well that's not true\n\n49:48.600 --> 49:51.200\nthey were making that point then that wouldn't be a way to make that point I\n\n49:51.200 --> 49:54.480\nthink it's if it's parody that's an incorrect use of those it's just\n\n49:54.480 --> 49:58.800\neverybody gathering around this thing and failing to that's just a whatever it\n\n49:58.800 --> 50:02.520\nis I don't know if it's Nathan for you or Banksy or whoever the fuck it is but\n\n50:02.520 --> 50:05.480\nsomebody's telling a joke somebody's just putting dumb in front of Starbucks\n\n50:05.480 --> 50:10.840\nand and and that's basically it you could you can have all levels of fun with\n\n50:10.840 --> 50:14.440\nthat but you definitely are never gonna digest that with the enzymes of\n\n50:14.440 --> 50:18.800\nintellectual logical discussion and they actually missed out on something but I\n\n50:18.800 --> 50:21.760\nalso feel like the correcting even if it's not like that like I do a video game\n\n50:21.760 --> 50:26.320\npodcast and that I bet rivals maybe like maybe even more we'll be like oh\n\n50:26.320 --> 50:31.360\nSuper Mario 3d world on the Gameboy advanced and 10 people like actually\n\n50:31.360 --> 50:35.680\nthat was on Gameboy color like what is anybody gaining from that I'm sorry we\n\n50:35.680 --> 50:38.840\nmiss both it's it's something that's written in the tweets it's the tone but\n\n50:38.840 --> 50:44.480\nI heard a Goldberg correcting what I just said Goldberg is one of the he's like\n\n50:44.480 --> 50:49.960\ncyber Christ he brings like he brings the phenomenon of getting corrected on\n\n50:49.960 --> 50:54.880\nTwitter into real life can we call this show cyber Christ and Stubnortz\n\n50:54.880 --> 50:59.920\ncyber Christ Stubnortz cyber Christ and Stubnortz and then we have to\n\n50:59.920 --> 51:03.520\nactually write a play and do for our hundreds upcoming show we're gonna do a\n\n51:03.520 --> 51:10.480\nlive play called cyber Christ and Stubnortz okay okay what if we could\n\n51:10.480 --> 51:14.440\ntrack down Stubnortz like is there a way to request a driver or something on\n\n51:14.440 --> 51:18.160\nUber I don't I don't know you gotta request a specific because that's the\n\n51:18.160 --> 51:22.800\nthing is like by the way this happened once this is a city sorry go ahead Uber\n\n51:22.800 --> 51:29.200\nthing Emily got it a person I we Emily and I were hanging out she got an Uber\n\n51:29.200 --> 51:32.720\ndriver he dropped her home he called her talked to her and then she texted me\n\n51:32.720 --> 51:37.200\nlike I'm home the doors unlocked to me but she by mistake texted the Uber\n\n51:37.200 --> 51:42.800\ndriver and she noticed and she said oh sorry not meant for you and he said no\n\n51:42.800 --> 51:58.000\nno I like in our top story two straight weeks the\n\n51:58.000 --> 52:14.360\nUber bandit is still at large she locked the door from that on out my my\n\n52:14.360 --> 52:22.240\ncackle is too is too non-sympathetic I'm laughing at the whatever at the terror\n\n52:22.240 --> 52:26.160\nthat is a bummer yeah it's a real bummer because wasn't I mean I mean again\n\n52:26.160 --> 52:28.840\nthat this might all be bullshit too and this might have been a smear campaign\n\n52:28.840 --> 52:31.680\nwasn't it in the very early days of the bird there was some sexual harassing\n\n52:31.680 --> 52:38.560\ngoing on or something or rapes that's that's worse I've never seen an\n\n52:38.560 --> 52:43.840\nUber driver with less than a 4.5 no they have to give them lower than that if\n\n52:43.840 --> 52:50.880\nthat happened to you right I reckon what is a rape star rating these days I'm\n\n52:50.880 --> 53:00.240\nout I'm out the but there's a part of the system this is another thing that\n\n53:00.240 --> 53:03.680\nkind of like well is that this is for the consumers benefit but then what kind\n\n53:03.680 --> 53:10.080\nof terror are we creating among the worker it the the way it works I'm\n\n53:10.080 --> 53:18.120\ntold is that if they drop below a 4.5 they get there they can't they can't\n\n53:18.120 --> 53:24.200\nget no Uber business no more ever again they're out of the club and so\n\n53:24.200 --> 53:29.480\nthey're terrified which is nice for all of us who have ever taken a cab over the\n\n53:29.480 --> 53:33.600\nlast 30 years it's a nice little slipper to put your foot in for a change of pace\n\n53:33.600 --> 53:38.720\na driver coming to pick you up who's a little frightened that he might not\n\n53:38.720 --> 53:42.840\nsatisfy you with your driving experience that's that's that's a welcome\n\n53:42.840 --> 53:47.200\nwelcome change but then you kind of over time you're kind of like well Jesus\n\n53:47.200 --> 53:51.120\nChrist what is this you know like like I don't know I feel bad I never give\n\n53:51.120 --> 53:55.760\nanyone less than a five now I feel like that's the new tip because I'm like well\n\n53:55.760 --> 54:01.840\nhe kind of was a four but what am I doing who am I like like what am I am I am\n\n54:01.840 --> 54:06.880\nI Simon Cowell like I what do I know about driving fucking five you tried\n\n54:06.880 --> 54:12.920\nyou'd give it your shot it's anyways I'm done talking so the only rating you\n\n54:12.920 --> 54:17.600\ncan give them is either a five or I think that would get them fired yeah that's\n\n54:17.600 --> 54:22.040\nthe second highest rating you can give them well well I know it's average yeah\n\n54:22.040 --> 54:25.160\nin a theoretical sense yeah I guess we need a mathematician to come up here and\n\n54:25.160 --> 54:28.840\nbut but but yeah you're you would be giving them a number that if everyone\n\n54:28.840 --> 54:32.960\nelse gave them that number they would be gone it kind of does it but I think I\n\n54:32.960 --> 54:36.240\nguess they figured that into their algorithm that people are gonna tend to\n\n54:36.240 --> 54:40.760\ngive you a five I guess like I would not want to give in a number to someone\n\n54:40.760 --> 54:44.480\nthat would get them fired like no that's why you give them fives well that's a\n\n54:44.480 --> 54:50.600\nlike wake I've never I've never under I've I've I've I have had horrible people\n\n54:50.600 --> 54:53.520\nwait on me in restaurants we all have we've all had they've been busy they've\n\n54:53.520 --> 54:57.760\nthey've been bad people they've been bad at their job I've I've never crossed a\n\n54:57.760 --> 55:01.320\nthreshold where I'm like here's your dollar for your tip like I always just\n\n55:01.320 --> 55:05.280\nlike I just go okay I'm because I've seen too many goddamn monologues and\n\n55:05.280 --> 55:09.000\nreservoir dogs and all this shit about you know that it's part they get taxed\n\n55:09.000 --> 55:12.840\nand all this stuff and it's hard for them and it's like I'm not gonna carry\n\n55:12.840 --> 55:19.000\nthat that relationship into finance so I'm tipping you 20% even though you suck\n\n55:19.000 --> 55:23.040\nand I just hate you because you suck but here's your 20% and it becomes\n\n55:23.040 --> 55:26.760\nsystematized that's to say like here's your five stars you were 10 minutes late\n\n55:26.760 --> 55:32.000\nand boy I'm really on a tear about something I'm not like blowing anybody's\n\n55:32.000 --> 55:34.640\nmind by saying like like you like we've talked about before like you have a lot\n\n55:34.640 --> 55:38.880\nof instant crisis like

59:49.680\nlike right that statistical oh yeah like okay there's two million people may be\n\n59:49.680 --> 59:54.360\nwatching it's like Todd Johnson eating your peas they're like let's just fuck\n\n59:54.360 --> 59:59.960\nhim up forever I watch a lot of I watch a lot of religious television late at\n\n59:59.960 --> 01:00:05.600\nnight and the faith healers on there I just good there's no better TV exception\n\n01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:11.240\nincluded you they will do things like the faith who will look at the camera and\n\n01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:14.640\nsay there's there's a woman named Marjorie out there and she has a type of lung\n\n01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:18.760\ncancer and I'm gonna focus on her right now and he went away of course either\n\n01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:22.800\nfalls on a Marjorie that has lung cancer or everybody out there is believing that\n\n01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:26.840\nthere's a Marjorie out there. That's like cold reading with no risk that's like that's\n\n01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:30.600\nlike that's cheating I never even thought about that it's all of course you can do that\n\n01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:33.960\nthough they used to do that on like romper room my mom told me about that she\n\n01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:37.040\nsaid like there would be like a magnifying glass that they would pick up\n\n01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:41.160\nand and look through it and they'd go I see Lisa I could see Lisa I could see\n\n01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:45.200\nTony Tony just stop picking on your sister so I guess that's yeah until you\n\n01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:49.160\nstart fucking charging for it who's the guy who was on TV and it was like\n\n01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:53.440\ncrossing the bridge or something like that crossing over Edwards yeah and he\n\n01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:58.200\nwould be like um I could send someone oh he's here his name starts with a T yeah\n\n01:00:58.200 --> 01:01:01.600\nand I was imagined like the ghosts are there but they don't even want to talk\n\n01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:05.320\nto these assholes you know like what's your name it's something with a T you\n\n01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:11.640\ndouchebag I really I was listening to the radio the other day and someone was\n\n01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:15.520\nit was a numerologist on this is gonna sort of reveal maybe how close-minded I\n\n01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:18.640\nam but he was talking about like if you take your birthday then you multiply it\n\n01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:22.960\nby this and this and I got so angry listening to this guy that's not close\n\n01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:26.960\nminded that's just being sensible not as close-minded as someone who listens to\n\n01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:36.000\nthe radio give your computer a chance it's got radio emulators on it he's\n\n01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:40.520\njust mad at you because it sounds smart Camille I just didn't get it I just it\n\n01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:44.760\njust bugged me so much that's crazy because I do think these psychics are\n\n01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:49.680\nlike they're praying on people who are in moments of weakness that's what they do\n\n01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:53.400\nI think that's a really interesting point because it's like the guys in my\n\n01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:57.400\nposition so if somebody ever tells me I'm not allowed to that I have some\n\n01:01:57.400 --> 01:02:02.160\naccountability when someone when someone tweets at me or it says like you made a\n\n01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:07.280\nyou made a polio joke on your show last night you need to not I'm offended all\n\n01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:11.680\nthis stuff my instant reaction is to go go fuck yourself you're watching TV wrong\n\n01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:16.400\nyou don't take it so seriously and all this stuff but I'm I'm I'm I'm I want\n\n01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:24.800\npeople to care about what I'm putting out there and and and and if there is\n\n01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:29.240\na responsibility Norman Lear knew that like like like he he's an example of\n\n01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:33.240\nsomebody that took that seriously said like you know what I'm making a sitcom\n\n01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:37.880\nI can keep I can keep doing stuff the same way or I could make a sitcom for\n\n01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:42.080\nblack people like like like because I want to not because I see a huge profit\n\n01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:45.040\nin it but because it's something seems wrong with what's well you know what's\n\n01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:48.200\nbeing presented on television we're shaping people's brains as they're\n\n01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:52.000\nwatching it in today's three-year-old is tomorrow's 40-year-old and they're all\n\n01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:55.600\nwatching TV and they're all learning from it it's like you you high road that\n\n01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:58.800\nwhen people are telling you what to do and you want to you want to fall back on\n\n01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:01.600\nlike you can't tell me what to do freedom of speech and all that stuff but\n\n01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:06.240\nthen you also like capitalize from it yeah but also sometimes like you have to\n\n01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:12.360\ntake every one of those instances at for what it is so and I do this podcast and\n\n01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:15.560\nin the intro there was one time I had hiccups it was just a couple weeks ago\n\n01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:18.440\nit was a five-minute thing and I'm I

for\n\n01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:21.240\nmy endoscopy you guys weren't as impressed by that Janice\n\n01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:27.080\nno it's just I don't know I mean I mean well because I believe me I had to go\n\n01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:32.920\ninto a whole weird state of denial about having a my first actual procedure\n\n01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:39.360\ndone I had never been knocked out so did you get general anesthesia I got\n\n01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:45.560\nspecific to me yeah he didn't get everyone in LA\n\n01:10:45.560 --> 01:10:49.760\nno did you get the actual military officer general anesthesia he comes in\n\n01:10:49.760 --> 01:11:02.640\nand he can't afford that corporal aspirin I had my tonsils out and I was\n\n01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:05.600\ngoing under and they put me on anesthesia and it wasn't the medical\n\n01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:09.320\nprocess I was afraid of I was in a hospital where I didn't trust them if\n\n01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:12.680\nwhile I was under something went wrong like an earthquake already it seemed\n\n01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:16.280\nlike chaos there was a woman across the way in her bed going you're gonna love\n\n01:11:16.280 --> 01:11:22.720\nthis another patient another patient what's the difference between these\n\n01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:27.880\nplaces in a DMV exactly I don't know what they're doing\n\n01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:36.320\nyears of schooling at least two more years than the DMV deal you know what\n\n01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:41.200\nI did with the last two years jack shit you can waste two years man I'm not in\n\n01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:46.240\nmedical school you can't add two years to the lady at the DMV and tell me that\n\n01:11:46.240 --> 01:11:49.720\nthat if my heart stops during my endoscopy they totally they tell you\n\n01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:55.080\nthey make you sign all these forms these are the forms say if you start to choke\n\n01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:59.320\nto death on the tube just you can't you have to sign all this stuff because\n\n01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:05.480\nbecause they can open up your chest on the on the well no no no that sounds\n\n01:12:05.480 --> 01:12:08.120\nexpensive that sounds like there's overhead involved you're signing the\n\n01:12:08.120 --> 01:12:13.240\nforms so that your loved ones can't sue them when you die that's why being being\n\n01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:17.600\nin the hospital during passed out during an earthquake is the safest place to be\n\n01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:22.680\nat this fit no I know man they ditch they ditch you don't don't they

01:15:06.920\nheavy artillery and the only way to make a tooth in that many pieces is to get in\n\n01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:11.400\nthere was just absolutely like oh man and then he didn't tell me he told me during\n\n01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:14.920\nthe x-rays he goes one of your roots because you're so old now you should\n\n01:15:14.920 --> 01:15:19.520\nhave just done when you're 18 now that you're 36 or 78 whatever I was you have\n\n01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:24.400\nto the root grew up your upper one it's right up to the edge of the sinus wall\n\n01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:29.800\nwhich is a very thin thin bone you know boy like they feel it sees that a lot of\n\n01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:33.400\npeople have this to have this dentist stuff that that's the thing so he said\n\n01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:36.240\nhe's like and I'm not that skirmish about this I didn't like the sound of this\n\n01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:40.520\nbut he was like it's possible that when I take it out it might perforate the bone\n\n01:15:40.520 --> 01:15:43.720\nthere there might be a little tiny hole in there if it is it'll heal up it'll\n\n01:15:43.720 --> 01:15:47.360\ntake longer to heal than the teeth and but he goes but this is paperwork on if\n\n01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:50.880\nit happens probably won't and you're you're healthy enough to the bone will\n\n01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:53.440\nregenerate and it take a month if it does happen but don't worry about it too\n\n01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:57.920\nmuch so I get home I'm on every sort of medication I was just absolutely shit\n\n01:15:57.920 --> 01:16:03.280\ncanned on whatever they had given me and my friend drove me home and I'm reading\n\n01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:07.640\nmy paperwork and I'm changing the gauze and I get some like some broth or\n\n01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:11.920\nwhatever I'm eating for my first meal and you're not allowed to swish your\n\n01:16:11.920 --> 01:16:15.560\nmouth or anything and so I kind of lean forward and I was in the sink I had a\n\n01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:21.440\nmouthful of soup and I lean forward and my soup came out of my nose because\n\n01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:26.480\nthere was a little hole in the top of my mouth and I called him up in the middle\n\n01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:31.000\nlike what the fuck is going on but you're the guy that can blow air out his\n\n01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:36.960\neyeballs too I can't anymore why because the hole is gone no you know I told\n\n01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:39.840\nhim about that I can also you know what else is going I took out my fucking\n\n01:16:39.840 --> 01:16:43.120\nwisdom teeth I used to make a dolphin sound that would wipe you out I remember\n\n01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:48.560\nthat can't do it now don't sound gone I would have thought about that if I had\n\n01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:53.600\na chance but also the thing did heal up for a couple days he's like oh so just\n\n01:16:53.600 --> 01:17:00.120\nhere's the thing don't blow your nose and do not sneeze for a month any more\n\n01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:05.560\ninvoluntary shit that I should know about like no breathing if you have to\n\n01:17:05.560 --> 01:17:09.720\nsneeze do it with your mouth as wide open as possible what does that look\n\n01:17:09.720 --> 01:17:19.720\nlike that's like the first act of speed like somebody that's kind

dates because a bunch of ten bucks the hour\n\n01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:50.040\nbefore your flight came back they were all going in the toilet yeah empty bag\n\n01:19:50.040 --> 01:19:55.440\ntime yeah

01:20:08.280\na lot Spencer I mean I don't fly none I before I worked at Apple I worked at a\n\n01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:13.000\nsmall bookstore and occasionally like two or three times a year I'd go and fly\n\n01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:17.120\nout to book conferences which are kind of like comic-cons just for ran random\n\n01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:22.560\nbooks it was a chance to see a big bookstore yeah what people dress up as\n\n01:20:22.560 --> 01:20:29.080\ntheir favorite books but the actual book yeah I don't want a dog pile and\n\n01:20:29.080 --> 01:20:34.640\neverything you say but was it a do they sell small books or is the store small\n\n01:20:34.640 --> 01:20:42.840\nis it like pamphlets and booklets or yeah and short stories all right\n\n01:20:42.840 --> 01:20:46.160\ncontinue until you say another combination of words that my ass burgers\n\n01:20:46.160 --> 01:20:49.600\ncan jump on but I would just go and they'd sell books for cheap because it'd\n\n01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:53.200\nbe like publishers trying to get down their stocks and I just go and buy like\n\n01:20:53.200 --> 01:20:58.480\nseveral booths and I'd you know get them all packed up and ship back to the main\n\n01:20:58.480 --> 01:21:03.280\noffice oh so you would go buy them at fairs and then sell them for a profit at\n\n01:21:03.280 --> 01:21:06.400\nyour yeah was there like a community of people that did this would like to do\n\n01:21:06.400 --> 01:21:11.280\nall up the same TJ Fridays like it like you're like not that I knew I'm sure if\n\n01:21:11.280 --> 01:21:15.080\nI did it for long enough there would be and then but I think they're all enemies\n\n01:21:15.080 --> 01:21:18.280\nit's like you know pond stars where it's just a bunch of trashy people selling\n\n01:21:18.280 --> 01:21:24.400\ngarbage like and they're just elbowing each other for a porcelain duck but I\n\n01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:28.640\nmean it's if you're if you're making a living off of selling like reclaim\n\n01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:33.400\nstuff I don't know I don't know you guys I don't I don't love pond stars because I\n\n01:21:33.400 --> 01:21:36.720\nalways feel like the people who are selling the stuff are clearly in need\n\n01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:39.960\nlike they're in a bad place they're selling shit and then these guys are\n\n01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:43.000\nlike talking to the

01:21:50.560\nthe side of the people who are clearly the big bad guy and it's really not\n\n01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:54.960\nadding value to anything I don't think I'm sure I'm wrong but I mean you could\n\n01:21:54.960 --> 01:21:58.840\nbe like a building a bridge is it supposed to be I've seen it like\n\n01:21:58.840 --> 01:22:02.800\nflipping through the yeah that yeah that you know your TV

what do you think Lenev is gonna be talking about\n\n01:33:41.560 --> 01:33:44.760\nout there it's not a big misunderstanding we didn't mean to kill the whole\n\n01:33:44.760 --> 01:33:50.120\nvillage

coming yes oh yeah everybody\n\n01:40:08.800 --> 01:40:15.040\nagrees with that your honor he did great service for land oh yeah we wouldn't\n\n01:40:15.040 --> 01:40:18.200\neven be having this conversation because we will be dead he'd still be alive we\n\n01:40:18.200 --> 01:40:21.880\ndon't be on the run from Admiral Darkstar instead we destroyed dead if not dead\n\n01:40:21.880 --> 01:40:26.000\nalready yeah instead of everybody being dead we just killed all the artisans let\n\n01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:33.120\nme rephrase that instead of everyone being dead because of the good we did all\n\n01:40:33.120 --> 01:40:42.800\nthe artisans are dead your honor there's a term in warfare and government's called\n\n01:40:42.800 --> 01:40:46.760\ncollateral damage that the needs of the many are greater than the needs of the\n\n01:40:46.760 --> 01:40:50.200\nfew and I think that's what we have here and if you fail to appreciate that you\n\n01:40:50.200 --> 01:40:54.600\nmight as well your your your justice in your malls might be as dead as you would\n\n01:40:54.600 --> 01:40:58.280\nbe if Darkstar was alive I think he is alive I think he's possessed\n\n01:40:58.280 -->

gas\n\n01:41:05.840 --> 01:41:10.640\neverywhere I don't know what the fuck and then I think Admiral Darkstar is\n\n01:41:10.640 --> 01:41:13.960\nstill alive and I certainly know he's alive in the hearts of all you assholes\n\n01:41:13.960 --> 01:41:17.840\nif you continue to be dicks to us because because that's what Admiral\n\n01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:23.080\nDarkstar wants he wants us fighting
