00:00.000 --> 00:18.640
Hello, you beautiful sons of bitches!

00:18.640 --> 00:24.320
From Meltdown Comics in Hollywood, California, Harmontown is now in session.

00:24.320 --> 00:28.560
I'd like to do the lights.

00:28.560 --> 00:32.720
Welcome to the stage, the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.

00:32.720 --> 00:46.760
It's probably not that different for them, but the lighting is very different for the

00:46.760 --> 00:47.760
performer tonight.

00:47.760 --> 00:50.200
They're shooting different kinds of stuff in here lately.

00:50.200 --> 00:53.360
Are they shooting like an autopsy scene?

00:53.360 --> 01:00.960
There is what seems to be the light Quincy used to figure out how people got killed above

01:00.960 --> 01:01.960
me.

01:01.960 --> 01:09.600
I'm fine with it and I'm sure I look great, but it's just funny how the little things

01:09.600 --> 01:10.600
kind of throw you.

01:10.600 --> 01:11.600
I like these though.

01:11.600 --> 01:16.640
Maybe for D&D we could get these little kind of groovy old Tesla, like your early Edison

01:16.640 --> 01:17.640
lights.

01:17.640 --> 01:20.120
Yeah, well Zach was taking me through and he's got full control over every single bulb

01:20.120 --> 01:21.120
in the building.

01:21.120 --> 01:27.080
Zach, can you take us through a couple of moods right now?

01:27.080 --> 01:30.360
Here's his list of moods you can accomplish with his controls.

01:30.360 --> 01:35.040
There's this one and there you go.

01:35.040 --> 01:40.120
I'm sure those of you listening at home understand that what we did was the old joke where there's

01:40.120 --> 01:41.120
two things.

01:41.120 --> 01:45.440
One of them was light bulbs on, one was light bulbs off.

01:45.440 --> 01:48.600
Oh no, but they can be slowly dimmed.

01:48.600 --> 01:51.480
Such a terrifying effect, it's kind of nice.

01:51.480 --> 01:52.480
Alright Jeff.

01:52.480 --> 01:53.480
Yes Dan?

01:53.480 --> 01:56.520
What I learned from the last couple of episodes is that this is going to be a segment driven

01:56.520 --> 01:57.520
show now.

01:57.520 --> 01:59.240
We've got segments, segments, segments.

01:59.240 --> 02:00.960
No tangents, more segments.

02:00.960 --> 02:20.160
Alright, so here's our new segment called, it's called Help Me Help Myself.

02:20.160 --> 02:21.160
See people love it.

02:21.160 --> 02:33.440
They love segments.

02:33.440 --> 02:36.960
So I need help with a couple of things.

02:36.960 --> 02:42.320
Facebook, help me with Facebook.

02:42.320 --> 02:44.360
Here's my dilemma.

02:44.360 --> 02:48.600
I've got lots of fucking problems with Facebook.

02:48.600 --> 02:56.640
So I have a Facebook account, I have at this point, I don't know, let's just say 42,000

02:56.640 --> 02:57.640
friends.

02:57.640 --> 03:04.240
I'm putting air quotes around friends of course because what that really means is like fans

03:04.240 --> 03:11.800
who I considered friends and who I certainly treat better than most of my friends.

03:11.800 --> 03:19.760
My Facebook page is, I never go to it and the inbox is just full of, you know, people

03:19.760 --> 03:27.720
going like, hey, I met you at such and such, it sort of renders Facebook's actual usefulness

03:27.720 --> 03:29.760
kind of neutral.

03:29.760 --> 03:32.600
It doesn't really, Facebook isn't really useful for me.

03:32.600 --> 03:36.080
So I never go to it and the syndrome continues.

03:36.080 --> 03:40.440
So I'm just wondering what the hell I'm supposed to do, should, this is a question you can't

03:40.440 --> 03:45.120
really ask without sounding like an asshole because you're like kind of humble bragging,

03:45.120 --> 03:46.120
aren't you?

03:46.120 --> 03:49.200
You're going like, somebody, what should I do?

03:49.200 --> 03:54.720
Because there's people that have the fan things, like, oh, this is the Ronald McDonald

03:54.720 --> 03:56.520
fan page.

03:56.520 --> 04:01.560
I'm a follower of Ronald McDonald, I'm not his friend though, and then there's Ronald

04:01.560 --> 04:06.720
McDonald's actual Facebook page, I assume, where he's like, I fucked, I fucked Grimace

04:06.720 --> 04:07.720
last night.

04:07.720 --> 04:12.400
Check it out, here's a picture of it, and he's like, you know, and it's cool, it's fine

04:12.400 --> 04:17.240
because it's like, it's only the fry guys and like, hamburger, or like, yeah, and he

04:17.240 --> 04:23.400
leaves a comment, says, Robble, Robble, and like, and, and, and, and, you know, Birdie,

04:23.400 --> 04:27.200
Birdie, Birdie liked this.

04:27.200 --> 04:30.360
Birdie likes everything.

04:30.360 --> 04:35.400
Moonhead, Moonhead's performing at the piano bar again.

04:35.400 --> 04:38.000
Was he just Mack, what was his name?

04:38.000 --> 04:39.360
I don't know, Mack, yeah, Mack.

04:39.360 --> 04:40.360
Mack tonight?

04:40.360 --> 04:48.280
Mack, Mack, Mack of Desperation, uh, that was the dark chapter of McDonald's, otherwise

04:48.280 --> 04:52.960
bright and shining, delightful, entertaining, cavalcade of characters.

04:52.960 --> 04:57.200
So are you asking, should you be more, should you treat Facebook more like a band would?

04:57.200 --> 05:02.240
I need to do something, I need, I need, I need someone to Facebook coach me, I need

05:02.240 --> 05:07.040
to, I need somebody to say, here's what you do, take your existing account with your 48

05:07.040 --> 05:12.160
million, whatever's, you know, do you convert that into a thing?

05:12.160 --> 05:15.880
Or do you, do you have to go through and, I think if you're a friend, you have to break

05:15.880 --> 05:16.880
up a 48 million.

05:16.880 --> 05:21.200
I have to, I have to, I have to, I have to go, I have to make an announcement, and this

05:21.200 --> 05:25.800
is a thing that like LA stand-ups like go through and like, like they, I think sometimes

05:25.800 --> 05:28.960
because I've heard stories, that's the other thing that has me gun-shy is that people go

05:28.960 --> 05:34.120
like, well my name's Dave Johnson, and I, they go like, oh man, I'm, you know what,

05:34.120 --> 05:37.880
I'm gonna change my Facebook account to a fan account, and then all the friends are

05:37.880 --> 05:43.600
like, fuck you, and it's, it's, you know, there's a, it's not exciting to the audience

05:43.600 --> 05:44.600
at all.

05:44.600 --> 05:48.600
And I don't know why, I thought it would be, I thought maybe a Facebook expert could come

05:48.600 --> 05:52.040
up and help me, that would be amazing.

05:52.040 --> 05:53.040
Let's move on.

05:53.040 --> 05:57.560
I mean, I would, I would guess that if we asked my applause, you would get several Facebook

05:57.560 --> 05:59.840
experts that would be quite happy to help you on that.

05:59.840 --> 06:03.800
And who would be quite proud to be Facebook experts, I'm sure.

06:03.800 --> 06:06.600
Facebook for me, because like, I was always, you know, like notoriously single, and I have

06:06.600 --> 06:10.440
a girlfriend, but Facebook, the only, like, perceivable benefit that ever was was you could

06:10.440 --> 06:13.360
go look up a picture of a girl you saw last night.

06:13.360 --> 06:17.120
You could type in her name and, and, and a couple triangulating bits of information,

06:17.120 --> 06:22.240
you go, oh okay, she was cute, or maybe she, she's a weirdo, she has a, a, a tattoo of

06:22.240 --> 06:28.240
a racial slur on her forehead, or like, but like, as somebody has, like, I have no, I

06:28.240 --> 06:29.240
have no use for it.

06:29.240 --> 06:33.240
Now, now I get in trouble, I got in trouble a little bit, not really a joking trouble

06:33.240 --> 06:39.000
with my girlfriend today, because she was, she loves Facebook, because she's from Scotland.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.320
So it's like, she keeps in touch with her friends and family for free.

06:41.320 --> 06:42.320
That's great.

06:42.320 --> 06:46.680
I, I'm from here, I, I see all the people I like.

06:46.680 --> 06:50.560
I like three people from school and one of them is coming on the show tonight, and anyone

06:50.560 --> 06:56.360
else I don't really need to talk to, but I am, because of you, I've been playing Heyday,

06:56.360 --> 07:01.920
that little game where you make a little farm, and she's like, oh, so you like Katie's farm,

07:01.920 --> 07:02.920
huh?

07:02.920 --> 07:03.920
I'm like, what?

07:03.920 --> 07:11.040
It's like, I, I click like and it tells everybody I know that I like to farm.

07:11.040 --> 07:12.040
That's the fucking worst thing.

07:12.040 --> 07:13.040
Yeah.

07:13.040 --> 07:15.320
I don't want to know about my Facebook Heyday paper trail.

07:15.320 --> 07:21.120
I mean, I'm proud of my candy crush paper trail, because I put a lot of fucking work

07:21.120 --> 07:22.120
in on that.

07:22.120 --> 07:23.120
Do you want help?

07:23.120 --> 07:24.120
Do you want help with your apple tree?

07:24.120 --> 07:25.120
Uh, yeah.

07:25.120 --> 07:26.120
Well, fuck it.

07:26.120 --> 07:27.120
I want help with my apple tree.

07:27.120 --> 07:34.320
I don't know that that means that it's like, I don't know, just an old, no country for

07:34.320 --> 07:39.200
old men, this internet, um, it's just too goddamn busy and it changes too much.

07:39.200 --> 07:41.960
And I know it's like, it's just too much shit going on on it.

07:41.960 --> 07:44.400
And the pictures are always like, every time you try to look at pictures, it's different.

07:44.400 --> 07:45.400
Yeah.

07:45.400 --> 07:46.400
I don't like it.

07:46.400 --> 07:47.400
Yeah.

07:47.400 --> 07:48.400
All right.

07:48.400 --> 07:49.400
Fuck Facebook.

07:49.400 --> 07:50.400
That's the conclusion.

07:50.400 --> 07:51.400
I don't need help with Facebook.

07:51.400 --> 07:52.400
Fuck Facebook.

07:52.400 --> 07:53.400
Fuck the movie about Facebook.

07:53.400 --> 07:54.400
I like that movie.

07:54.400 --> 07:55.400
That's a good movie.

07:55.400 --> 07:56.400
No.

07:56.400 --> 07:57.400
Fuck you.

07:57.400 --> 07:58.400
Oh, okay.

07:58.400 --> 07:59.400
That's fine.

07:59.400 --> 08:00.400
That's valid.

08:00.400 --> 08:01.400
All right.

08:01.400 --> 08:04.760
So here's the, here's the last, here's the second and last item in this segment that

08:04.760 --> 08:05.760
I need help with.

08:05.760 --> 08:06.760
What was it?

08:06.760 --> 08:07.760
Help myself?

08:07.760 --> 08:08.760
Help me help you?

08:08.760 --> 08:09.760
Help me help myself.

08:09.760 --> 08:10.760
I came up with that on the fly.

08:10.760 --> 08:17.360
I'd say it's a take on the help me help you from Jerry McDoodles.

08:17.360 --> 08:21.960
So, so when you, when you get it, when you get an Uber, a lot of my, a lot of my time

08:21.960 --> 08:27.040
is spent in Ubers now, Uber, Uber, Uber cars, the non-taxi get a ride.

08:27.040 --> 08:36.640
So one of the things that makes it a non-taxi ride is the compulsive insistence of the driver

08:36.640 --> 08:46.200
on opening the door for you and it's especially annoying upon arrival because it truly slows

08:46.200 --> 08:52.720
you down that you pull up and they, you know, okay, we're here and he's like scrambling.

08:52.720 --> 08:56.600
It's, it's, it's, it's, they, they tell them or something.

08:56.600 --> 08:59.080
Someone's telling people you have to open the door for them.

08:59.080 --> 09:04.040
That's what makes it not a cab and it's, I keep, I, I, sometimes I have success by

09:04.040 --> 09:09.560
going like, I got the door, it's fine and they're like, fuck, okay.

09:09.560 --> 09:13.360
But like, you have to like assert yourself, you have to like deny someone something and

09:13.360 --> 09:17.160
if you don't, if you just go with the flow, it's the most ridiculous thing in the world.

09:17.160 --> 09:25.920
You pull up to a thing, a yogurt bin, wherever you're going and not the one close by your

09:25.920 --> 09:29.120
house that you could walk to, the one that, the good one that you have to get a ride to.

09:29.120 --> 09:34.160
The Crosstown Yogurt Bin, the, over by the bazaar, you don't want to take your own car

09:34.160 --> 09:36.280
there because you know how the parking is at the Crosstown Yogurt Bin.

09:36.280 --> 09:41.120
I'm going to drive it back drunk on yogurt through all those Burbank cops.

09:41.120 --> 09:42.120
That's what they're waiting for.

09:42.120 --> 09:48.120
There's like three, three cops right outside the yogurt bin, like, we're going to get them.

09:48.120 --> 09:51.120
You pull up and then it's just, it's just, I don't know, what do you, what do you do?

09:51.120 --> 09:55.640
I would say here, I will, I will give this advice to you if I could help you help yourself

09:55.640 --> 09:56.640
on this one.

09:56.640 --> 10:00.460
You're going to start taking Ubers everywhere and you're going to be, you're going to keep

10:00.460 --> 10:04.600
getting out of the backseat of a car and opened by a gentleman.

10:04.600 --> 10:05.600
Own it.

10:05.600 --> 10:06.600
You want me to own it.

10:06.600 --> 10:11.960
Start wearing long white fur coats and, and, and like, and, and like a nylon stockings

10:11.960 --> 10:15.120
and like, kind of put my leg out so it's sort of the camera can pan up.

10:15.120 --> 10:16.120
There you are.

10:16.120 --> 10:17.120
Yeah.

10:17.120 --> 10:18.120
Start doing some upskirts.

10:18.120 --> 10:21.320
Like some, some, some nip slips, like really fucking get, like give us something.

10:21.320 --> 10:22.320
All right.

10:22.320 --> 10:23.320
I'll just make it worth our while.

10:23.320 --> 10:25.640
I'll get like a prop poodle.

10:25.640 --> 10:26.640
Yeah.

10:26.640 --> 10:29.440
The, the, the high heel shoes with the goldfish and the thing.

10:29.440 --> 10:30.440
Yeah.

10:30.440 --> 10:31.440
Let me like do the whole thing.

10:31.440 --> 10:32.440
I'll just always have shopping bags with me.

10:32.440 --> 10:35.440
See, that might be useful if I get a bunch of shit.

10:35.440 --> 10:36.440
I don't know.

10:36.440 --> 10:37.440
All right.

10:37.440 --> 10:48.440
Uh, my next segment is, uh, is called, uh, uh, Starbound, a video game I'm playing.

10:48.440 --> 10:49.440
Starbound's great.

10:49.440 --> 10:50.920
It's a great video game.

10:50.920 --> 10:51.920
All right.

10:51.920 --> 10:52.920
That was it?

10:52.920 --> 10:53.920
Yep.

10:53.920 --> 10:54.920
Wait, Dan.

10:54.920 --> 10:55.920
Uh-huh.

10:55.920 --> 10:58.080
You just learned how to help yourself.

10:58.080 --> 10:59.680
You didn't need us to help you on that one.

10:59.680 --> 11:00.680
No, no, no.

11:00.680 --> 11:02.480
That's the, that's the, that's the old segment.

11:02.480 --> 11:03.480
I know.

11:03.480 --> 11:04.480
Oh.

11:04.480 --> 11:05.480
That was the two different segments.

11:05.480 --> 11:06.480
Okay.

11:06.480 --> 11:09.280
Well, I mean, like I was just excited that you, that you've already like, you went from

11:09.280 --> 11:11.280
helplessness to completely activated.

11:11.280 --> 11:12.280
Oh, no, no.

11:12.280 --> 11:13.280
Yeah.

11:13.280 --> 11:14.720
I only need help with the Ubers and the Facebook.

11:14.720 --> 11:16.120
I, Starbound, I'm good.

11:16.120 --> 11:17.120
It's great.

11:17.120 --> 11:18.120
It's a great game.

11:18.120 --> 11:19.120
Did you give up on your, on your eye Harmon?

11:19.120 --> 11:20.840
That you're not, I mean, you gave up on it pretty quickly.

11:20.840 --> 11:21.840
Yeah.

11:21.840 --> 11:22.840
I gave up.

11:22.840 --> 11:23.840
Yep.

11:23.840 --> 11:24.840
Yeah.

11:24.840 --> 11:29.000
But, or high and hard, what was the deciding factor on no more notepads around your neck?

11:29.000 --> 11:31.240
I just can't, it just wasn't working.

11:31.240 --> 11:37.480
It just doesn't, if I have a, I'm using a new kind of app that works with Evernote that

11:37.480 --> 11:41.720
my friend Kevin Day recommended to me.

11:41.720 --> 11:49.080
It's called EverMemo and all it does is it just lets you put in a memo and it puts it

11:49.080 --> 11:51.360
into Evernote for you.

11:51.360 --> 11:55.880
Yeah, it kind of, does it, does Evernote roll its eyes when that happens?

11:55.880 --> 12:00.480
I think, I think Evernote is like, is he, is he still using Evernote?

12:00.480 --> 12:04.120
Like, we got him, like, like, yeah, it's kind of built on top of Evernote.

12:04.120 --> 12:05.120
I don't get it anymore.

12:05.120 --> 12:07.120
I don't like, just kill myself.

12:07.120 --> 12:11.640
Just give me an app that's just like a rope that I can just kill myself on.

12:11.640 --> 12:15.080
I just, you actually, keyboard doesn't work anymore, you can't type anymore.

12:15.080 --> 12:17.960
They're just, they're just weeding people like me out, man.

12:17.960 --> 12:22.040
For a while, you had the affectation of carrying around the little magnetic ball chain thing

12:22.040 --> 12:25.840
that you can make little shapes and stuff and you were like, you were like a cute little

12:25.840 --> 12:32.440
like savant baby at the restaurant and nobody bothered you because you were clearly making

12:32.440 --> 12:33.440
a cube.

12:33.440 --> 12:34.440
It looked weird, yeah.

12:34.440 --> 12:35.440
Yeah.

12:35.440 --> 12:37.320
It looked like I could strangle you with it.

12:37.320 --> 12:39.680
Um, anyways, I'm still looking at this.

12:39.680 --> 12:40.800
There's only one more thing on it.

12:40.800 --> 12:42.440
I don't like Southwest Airlines.

12:42.440 --> 12:47.880
I don't, uh, we went to Sketch Fest and I, I, I don't like this first come first

12:47.880 --> 12:48.880
serve seating thing.

12:48.880 --> 12:53.280
I don't like the weird combination between that and the, uh, you're in section A we're

12:53.280 --> 12:54.280
going to call.

12:54.280 --> 12:55.640
I don't, I don't, I don't get it.

12:55.640 --> 12:58.080
I don't, no one likes to get on an airplane.

12:58.080 --> 12:59.560
Nobody likes air travel.

12:59.560 --> 13:04.280
Uh, they, they, they just, they cram you into this little tube.

13:04.280 --> 13:05.360
You might die.

13:05.360 --> 13:09.520
I know that you're more likely to die in the freeway, but you're also more likely to die

13:09.520 --> 13:11.320
by your own hand on the freeway.

13:11.320 --> 13:15.520
Like you must, you're more likely to have the satisfaction of skidding into another guy

13:15.520 --> 13:19.520
making eye contact with them before you get decapitated and both of you going like, fuck

13:19.520 --> 13:20.520
you.

13:20.520 --> 13:24.440
Or, or just like, or just like, oh shit.

13:24.440 --> 13:26.120
Like on an airplane, it's just, fuck it.

13:26.120 --> 13:30.080
There's just some coped up Denzel Washington in the cockpit and you know, you're flying

13:30.080 --> 13:31.080
upside down.

13:31.080 --> 13:32.080
Cause you hit turbulence.

13:32.080 --> 13:33.080
You don't know what's going on.

13:33.080 --> 13:34.080
They could get over the thing.

13:34.080 --> 13:35.080
Are they telling you the truth or not?

13:35.080 --> 13:36.760
Is this some asshole up there?

13:36.760 --> 13:41.680
Like some gas holes all around you, bossing you around, put your phone in airplane mode.

13:41.680 --> 13:42.680
You can use it now.

13:42.680 --> 13:43.680
You can't use it.

13:43.680 --> 13:44.680
Hey, by the way.

13:44.680 --> 13:51.120
I had my phone out of airplane mode the whole time.

13:51.120 --> 13:52.620
Science experiment over.

13:52.620 --> 13:54.120
The plane doesn't crash.

13:54.120 --> 13:56.200
It's done with this fucking garbage.

13:56.200 --> 13:59.440
I know they just changed the rules so now you can actually, ooh, you can have the things

13:59.440 --> 14:02.400
on, but also what the fuck, why are they always bossing you around?

14:02.400 --> 14:08.960
Why is everything a fucking caveat and a disclaimer items may have shifted in the thing.

14:08.960 --> 14:16.240
What fucking asshole got knocked out by a duffel bag in 1938 that we all have to listen

14:16.240 --> 14:20.560
to, you know, the amount of time put together that we've all had to listen to that fucking

14:20.560 --> 14:23.520
warning about how items may have shifted.

14:23.520 --> 14:24.680
What the fuck is going on?

14:24.680 --> 14:26.160
Have you ever seen an item shift?

14:26.160 --> 14:28.040
Have you ever seen anything fall out?

14:28.040 --> 14:29.680
Has anyone ever gotten hurt?

14:29.680 --> 14:35.320
Obviously one person did and they're so worried about that $15,000 lawsuit that for fucking

14:35.320 --> 14:39.680
50 years they've been telling you about the item shifting, I just, I just hate them.

14:39.680 --> 14:40.680
I hate them.

14:40.680 --> 14:41.680
I hate them.

14:41.680 --> 14:42.680
What?

14:42.680 --> 14:43.680
What?

14:43.680 --> 14:44.680
What?

14:44.680 --> 14:46.160
Who's Billy Mays guy?

14:46.160 --> 14:48.200
Billy Mays died.

14:48.200 --> 14:49.200
The baseball player.

14:49.200 --> 14:54.000
First of all, I can't, this lady means I can't see you.

14:54.000 --> 14:59.160
Oh yeah, the, the, the, the cookie and infomercial guy, the ShamWow or whatever the hell, not

14:59.160 --> 15:01.480
the ShamWow guy, but the oxy clean.

15:01.480 --> 15:05.680
He died by item shiftage in the overhead compartments.

15:05.680 --> 15:09.400
No, he died because his heart exploded from cocaine.

15:09.400 --> 15:12.800
I mean, and also, but not only did you do that, Adam, but before you did it, I think

15:12.800 --> 15:13.800
you went, really?

15:13.800 --> 15:18.280
Like, like, like you were incredulous about mid rant.

15:18.280 --> 15:21.160
You did fucking rant is, uh, interruptus.

15:21.160 --> 15:22.160
Yeah.

15:22.160 --> 15:27.040
I have, I have blue rant now.

15:27.040 --> 15:33.360
My outrage just numb, hurts, someone's gotta give me a, gonna massage me with their hand

15:33.360 --> 15:37.640
until I'm angry about something again.

15:37.640 --> 15:39.680
I wish you all could have been up there for the show.

15:39.680 --> 15:43.400
We did a couple nights ago in San Francisco where a fellow named Jeremy came out on stage

15:43.400 --> 15:46.040
and then shit went just straight up.

15:46.040 --> 15:47.040
Well, they've heard it by now.

15:47.040 --> 15:51.080
They're, I mean, like, but, but Neil Brook, the guy that's shooting into the documentary,

15:51.080 --> 15:52.880
said like, I hated that Eva girl.

15:52.880 --> 15:56.760
And I was like, you wouldn't have, if you saw her, you would have hated the guy more.

15:56.760 --> 15:57.760
Oh yeah.

15:57.760 --> 15:58.760
There's a thing that you don't visit.

15:58.760 --> 16:04.440
There's an oral versus visual experience you have with podcasts and live shows where, um,

16:04.440 --> 16:07.440
nobody really had a problem with her that I could, I mean, maybe somebody did.

16:07.440 --> 16:10.560
But as one, the audience instantly didn't like that guy.

16:10.560 --> 16:15.200
And it was, and it was, it wasn't because he, you know, was, was wearing like a KKK outfit.

16:15.200 --> 16:19.000
Like he was just, he was, I would qualify that and say, well, as I said up there, I

16:19.000 --> 16:22.480
don't, I don't know how many people didn't actually decided that they didn't, they didn't

16:22.480 --> 16:23.480
like him.

16:23.480 --> 16:28.880
And I think that like a vast majority of people suddenly decided that they didn't believe

16:28.880 --> 16:29.880
him.

16:29.880 --> 16:30.880
Yeah.

16:30.880 --> 16:32.720
But then, but then what, when it was like, well, it's, maybe he's just awkward or maybe

16:32.720 --> 16:37.000
just this, but then it was just like, boo, I think that at some point they just would

16:37.000 --> 16:39.200
rather him not have been up there or whatever.

16:39.200 --> 16:40.200
Yeah.

16:40.200 --> 16:41.200
I don't know.

16:41.200 --> 16:42.600
I think if they all went out and had a drink with him after the show, like everything might

16:42.600 --> 16:47.920
have been fine, but just as far as the moment somebody came up on stage and made it onto

16:47.920 --> 16:52.280
the stage, that person ceased to be one of them and became somebody that they wanted

16:52.280 --> 16:53.920
not up there as best paying customers.

16:53.920 --> 16:54.920
Yeah.

16:54.920 --> 16:57.320
I think everybody, everybody that comes to a harm attack show, they go like, you know,

16:57.320 --> 16:59.200
they like the fact that somebody can come up.

16:59.200 --> 17:03.680
They like that experience, but that person owes a lot to the audience because the audience

17:03.680 --> 17:08.800
is sitting there thinking, I paid $10 to, I'd love to be on stage, maybe, maybe not.

17:08.800 --> 17:10.880
But in either case, I'm not coming up there.

17:10.880 --> 17:12.640
So what the fuck are you doing up there?

17:12.640 --> 17:14.400
And you better, you better make it good.

17:14.400 --> 17:19.120
And I think people are less prone to feel that way when they're listening to the podcast

17:19.120 --> 17:23.000
than when they're sitting in the audience because they waited in line, et cetera, and

17:23.000 --> 17:26.600
they can, pheromones and visuals, body language.

17:26.600 --> 17:30.160
That's why that phenomenon of like in the early days, it was like, Adam Goldberg, do

17:30.160 --> 17:32.440
you love him or hate him?

17:32.440 --> 17:36.560
Is he a hamburger or a hero?

17:36.560 --> 17:40.440
And I think it seemed like people that listened to the podcast were like, I don't mind Adam

17:40.440 --> 17:41.440
Goldberg.

17:41.440 --> 17:42.440
He's fine.

17:42.440 --> 17:43.440
Yeah.

17:43.440 --> 17:45.520
Cause he's like coming through one channel and, and you're just, you're just chopping

17:45.520 --> 17:50.600
carrots and he's not fucking with that.

17:50.600 --> 17:53.080
But you come, there's a difference if you're sitting in the crowd.

17:53.080 --> 17:57.240
But here, you, you know that if, if you were chopping carrots and he could fuck with that,

17:57.240 --> 17:58.240
he would.

17:58.240 --> 18:01.680
It's been a long time since we talked to Adam Goldberg, isn't it?

18:01.680 --> 18:04.520
Should we just bring him up and just like, like, let's just talk to him.

18:04.520 --> 18:12.160
Adam, Adam, get up on stage, you little devil.

18:12.160 --> 18:17.400
The crowd goes mild, I love it.

18:17.400 --> 18:20.920
The ever increasingly tepid applause of bringing you up on stage.

18:20.920 --> 18:21.920
Fine.

18:21.920 --> 18:22.920
It's fine.

18:22.920 --> 18:26.720
It's the, the joke was stale a year and a half ago and I'm fine.

18:26.720 --> 18:30.280
You, so you hate stale premises?

18:30.280 --> 18:32.000
I'm reinventing this premise.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
You know what?

18:33.000 --> 18:37.640
In the last year, I got an O from, I'm reinventing myself with this.

18:37.640 --> 18:39.800
You haven't been up here long enough to start judging people yet.

18:39.800 --> 18:41.600
No, you're right.

18:41.600 --> 18:42.600
It's fair point.

18:42.600 --> 18:47.560
Also you, and not to derail a derailment, but you, she made one little sound that was

18:47.560 --> 18:51.480
the sound of enjoying a show and you, you have been for the last 10 minutes, you go

18:51.480 --> 18:52.480
like.

18:52.480 --> 18:54.480
I can hear you.

18:54.480 --> 18:55.480
Robbo, Robbo.

18:55.480 --> 18:56.480
Yes.

18:56.480 --> 18:58.280
I, I, I, and it, it bumps me.

18:58.280 --> 19:04.160
It means I've been rooting for you and Grimace for a long time.

19:04.160 --> 19:10.480
Robbo, Robbo, but yeah, he did die from a, he was, he died because a bunch of junk fell

19:10.480 --> 19:11.840
on him in an airplane.

19:11.840 --> 19:13.640
That's not true.

19:13.640 --> 19:19.280
Fox News, Fox News, the local Fox News says it's true, not Fox News, the international

19:19.280 --> 19:20.280
one.

19:20.280 --> 19:23.000
I would say his, his, his publicist wants you to think that's true.

19:23.000 --> 19:28.120
That'd be the most, the worst day as a publicist where you have to be like, how did he die?

19:28.120 --> 19:29.120
He was unpacking his suitcase.

19:29.120 --> 19:34.120
I don't know how he died, but if he died because an item fell on him, it was a kilo of cocaine

19:34.120 --> 19:37.600
and it fell into his nostril.

19:37.600 --> 19:41.880
I would like to see, that's a, I don't know if myth, myth busters should address that.

19:41.880 --> 19:47.440
Like how, like, can you create a situation where items shift enough in an overhead compartment

19:47.440 --> 19:52.600
that, you know, how much damage can you do to a human being that's unwarned, you know,

19:52.600 --> 19:57.600
and then the most important part is, now let's warn them and see what fucking changes.

19:57.600 --> 20:00.440
Because what are we, am I, am I Neo for the Matrix?

20:00.440 --> 20:04.560
If I know that the items have shifted, I'm going to like do a back bend and it's going

20:04.560 --> 20:09.000
to bullet time over my shoulder, and what the hell is up there?

20:09.000 --> 20:10.960
Oh, how fast is it traveling?

20:10.960 --> 20:11.960
What the fuck is that?

20:11.960 --> 20:13.760
Those things open like DeLorean doors.

20:13.760 --> 20:15.560
They open like the gold wings.

20:15.560 --> 20:16.760
What's going to jump out?

20:16.760 --> 20:21.320
Like a fucking, does somebody have a, have a, have the monster from basket case in there?

20:21.320 --> 20:32.600
Is it a, is it a, is it a, is it a critter from the, from the joke one guy got?

20:32.600 --> 20:38.600
That was a, that was a Kumail laugh from the Roger Corman classic, right?

20:38.600 --> 20:42.280
Is that just Kumail digging the shove in the background?

20:42.280 --> 20:44.120
I didn't want to give you blue rant in the middle there.

20:44.120 --> 20:45.120
All right.

20:45.120 --> 20:46.120
Well, sorry.

20:46.120 --> 20:47.120
It was the creature from Critter.

20:47.120 --> 20:48.120
Okay.

20:48.120 --> 20:49.120
So Adam, how, how are you doing?

20:49.120 --> 20:50.120
What, what are you doing vocationally?

20:50.120 --> 20:52.080
I started, I started my own business.

20:52.080 --> 20:56.200
I do search engine strategy and optimization.

20:56.200 --> 21:01.360
I make sure online stores actually sell things when they want to, which is important when

21:01.360 --> 21:03.720
people only go to one website to buy things.

21:03.720 --> 21:06.040
Honey, so, so, so Target comes to you.

21:06.040 --> 21:07.040
I wish Target.

21:07.040 --> 21:09.040
I know they don't, but let's say Target comes to you.

21:09.040 --> 21:13.400
Someone opened this, it's like a, like a fishing expo in Minnesota and they're like, ah, people

21:13.400 --> 21:14.960
aren't buying enough fishing lures.

21:14.960 --> 21:17.040
We got 3% of customers buying them.

21:17.040 --> 21:18.200
Can you get that up to six?

21:18.200 --> 21:19.200
I'm like, yes.

21:19.200 --> 21:23.200
So you look at the things that happen when you Google fishing lures and you see, and

21:23.200 --> 21:28.920
you, you, you, what do you, I changed websites so that they, people aren't like, ah, I guess

21:28.920 --> 21:30.560
I don't need a fishing lure.

21:30.560 --> 21:32.040
Maybe the ones I have are good.

21:32.040 --> 21:36.640
I don't want to click through 15 different pages as opposed to like getting coffee for

21:36.640 --> 21:42.040
people and driving RVs badly, which was the last year of my life and producing that shark

21:42.040 --> 21:47.680
movie, which everyone, I got fired from it two days after talking about being on it here.

21:47.680 --> 21:52.840
And everyone got carbon monoxide poisoning because they rented cheap trailers.

21:52.840 --> 21:58.880
And are you, are you still under investigation for that?

21:58.880 --> 22:01.600
Have police eliminated you as, as a possible suspect?

22:01.600 --> 22:05.040
Well, they, they Googled Adam Goldberg culpable monoxide.

22:05.040 --> 22:06.040
Yeah.

22:06.040 --> 22:07.040
Nothing came out.

22:07.040 --> 22:10.640
They just saw a lovely fishing lure and they're like, all right, let's all go fishing.

22:10.640 --> 22:12.720
He seems a little short to be on the Vikings.

22:12.720 --> 22:17.000
I don't think that's, no, Hulk Hogan's daughter was like, this script is below me.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.160
I'm not going to do it.

22:18.160 --> 22:22.480
And then I got fired and then they kept making the movie and then I was unfired and then

22:22.480 --> 22:23.680
I was refired.

22:23.680 --> 22:27.840
It was just like continual panic attacks.

22:27.840 --> 22:31.960
So when you see a shitty shark movie, it's not because they weren't trying.

22:31.960 --> 22:35.920
It's because one person was trying and everyone else wasn't.

22:35.920 --> 22:38.680
You were the guy that was trying your side.

22:38.680 --> 22:39.680
I was.

22:39.680 --> 22:44.480
We had, we're splitting an internet connection eight ways and I was hired into a position

22:44.480 --> 22:50.760
two levels above my competency, which at the time it was minimal, but this was, hey

22:50.760 --> 22:55.120
Adam, you've, you've been in charge of dozens of dollars before.

22:55.120 --> 22:56.120
Where are we shooting?

22:56.120 --> 22:57.120
I don't know.

22:57.120 --> 22:58.120
I don't know.

22:58.120 --> 22:59.120
What was the, what was your position on the shark movie?

22:59.120 --> 23:00.680
I was production coordinator.

23:00.680 --> 23:02.280
I thought it was going to be a decision.

23:02.280 --> 23:04.480
Uh, it was, no, it was production manager.

23:04.480 --> 23:08.080
I thought it was getting hired on as associate, uh, PC.

23:08.080 --> 23:10.880
Is this you just nailing a phony baloney resume or?

23:10.880 --> 23:14.760
I was like, Hey, my friend's making a skiing movie.

23:14.760 --> 23:15.760
You want to do it?

23:15.760 --> 23:17.760
Like, I guess I'm not doing anything.

23:17.760 --> 23:19.760
Hey, production manager.

23:19.760 --> 23:25.160
I'm like, no, no, no, no, no, no, I don't know.

23:25.160 --> 23:26.160
I don't want to, I don't want to.

23:26.160 --> 23:30.320
You know, you are anything, but I just, you, you, you have a, you have a, you're a mover

23:30.320 --> 23:31.320
and a shaker.

23:31.320 --> 23:35.160
I got a feeling you ended up in a situation where you were over your head by your own

23:35.160 --> 23:36.160
design.

23:36.160 --> 23:38.160
You got, you got what you bargained for.

23:38.160 --> 23:39.960
It's like I got more than I bargained for.

23:39.960 --> 23:43.640
You slip into the back doors of limos and you're like, yeah, I know Ben Vereen.

23:43.640 --> 23:46.720
Like, like, like, you just kind of like Ben Vereen.

23:46.720 --> 23:51.840
Is that like a, for those keeping track of it, I'm Quincy and Ben Vereen are the, are

23:51.840 --> 23:56.800
they, are they, are they, are they, are they owning my age?

23:56.800 --> 23:58.880
You got, you got, you know, when, when you read Salinger, you probably have to look

23:58.880 --> 23:59.880
shit up too.

23:59.880 --> 24:00.880
He's worth it.

24:00.880 --> 24:01.880
Wow.

24:01.880 --> 24:02.880
Obscura.

24:02.880 --> 24:03.880
I can't do it.

24:03.880 --> 24:10.640
We just got, we just got, we just got defensively hyroated on the Ben Vereen reference.

24:10.640 --> 24:15.160
Nothing would be worse than me than your uncle, your uncle trying to be like, what's going

24:15.160 --> 24:16.160
on with Pokemon?

24:16.160 --> 24:19.400
There's so many Pokemon now.

24:19.400 --> 24:23.360
I can't, I feel old when I was like, it used to be not very many Pokemon.

24:23.360 --> 24:26.240
Now there are very many Pokemon.

24:26.240 --> 24:27.640
It's, you got to catch them all, right?

24:27.640 --> 24:28.640
I can't.

24:28.640 --> 24:29.640
I want it to.

24:29.640 --> 24:30.640
I don't have, I run a business now.

24:30.640 --> 24:32.480
I got to hire someone to catch my Pokemon.

24:32.480 --> 24:33.480
All right.

24:33.480 --> 24:36.720
Let's have a historic happy ending for an Adam Goldberg appearance and, and, and thank

24:36.720 --> 24:37.720
him for coming up.

24:37.720 --> 24:38.720
Thank you.

24:38.720 --> 24:39.720
Adam Goldberg.

24:39.720 --> 24:40.720
Thank you, brother.

24:40.720 --> 24:48.240
I have, I would have had more questions for him, but we have, we have a lot of talent

24:48.240 --> 24:49.240
in the show tonight.

24:49.240 --> 24:50.240
There's too much show tonight.

24:50.240 --> 24:51.240
Too much show.

24:51.240 --> 24:52.240
There's too much show.

24:52.240 --> 24:53.240
Not enough time.

24:53.240 --> 24:54.240
Too much, too much energy.

24:54.240 --> 24:55.720
Too much, too much entertainment in store for them.

24:55.720 --> 24:56.720
Yeah.

24:56.720 --> 24:58.520
They're going to, it's going to be coming up over the top.

24:58.520 --> 24:59.840
There's going to be a meniscus.

24:59.840 --> 25:01.840
I think that our, our show, the amount of show.

25:01.840 --> 25:05.440
They're going to have to go like this on the top of the show before they carry it to the

25:05.440 --> 25:06.440
table.

25:06.440 --> 25:09.520
If you try to pick the show up across the table, it's going to end up in your lap.

25:09.520 --> 25:10.520
Yeah.

25:10.520 --> 25:12.280
You're going to have to, as gross as it is for your friends, you're going to have to

25:12.280 --> 25:15.560
slurp from the top of the, of the show before you give it to them.

25:15.560 --> 25:19.960
And I think that our show naturally counter balances the lack of lighting that we have

25:19.960 --> 25:20.960
now.

25:20.960 --> 25:25.120
I think we put, we put more show on the stage because it's just the one autopsy light.

25:25.120 --> 25:28.520
The weird, the weird secondary effect of this diffuse kind of lighting that's made for

25:28.520 --> 25:32.000
shooting is that I can't see anybody in the audience as usual, except for everyone in

25:32.000 --> 25:35.680
the front row who are lit like the, the Kryptonian tribunal.

25:35.680 --> 25:36.680
Exactly.

25:36.680 --> 25:43.040
They look like they're going to, they're going to sentence me to the phantom zone or be sentenced

25:43.040 --> 25:44.040
to the phantom zone.

25:44.040 --> 25:47.760
I don't know, it was the same thing in San Francisco and comedy club.

25:47.760 --> 25:50.520
There was this balcony and all the people were strangely lit in the front row of the

25:50.520 --> 25:51.520
balcony.

25:51.520 --> 25:53.820
There were these people sitting above you.

25:53.820 --> 25:54.820
Yeah.

25:54.820 --> 25:57.820
Can we, can we, I'll get up here.

25:57.820 --> 26:00.820
Have a question for you.

26:00.820 --> 26:04.960
You just, can we have Nanjiani everybody.

26:04.960 --> 26:05.960
What have you wrought?

26:05.960 --> 26:08.260
Hey, how's it going?

26:08.260 --> 26:12.240
Because it's lit this way because of the good news that you're shooting your comedy

26:12.240 --> 26:17.520
Fufu laser laser bomb show we're doing the comedy Fufu laser bomb show for

26:17.520 --> 26:20.920
Comedy Central now we're doing the meltdown which I host with Jonah Ray

26:20.920 --> 26:26.320
every week and we're doing it for TV so I apologize we're doing the hacky

26:26.320 --> 26:29.640
riffing the set thing and we did it poorly and it's right no it's great can

26:29.640 --> 26:33.920
I say something again I'm gonna piss I was talking to gorelly back there and I

26:33.920 --> 26:39.880
was like it is if you're in a position to fire Adam Goldberg can you even bring

26:39.880 --> 26:45.200
yourself to not do it like and then gorelly said they probably hired him

26:45.200 --> 26:48.800
again to fire him again

26:49.800 --> 26:55.760
like if you could fire him from this how great would it feel no offense bro the

26:55.760 --> 27:00.160
thing is we the thing is theoretically we should be able to fire him but we can

27:00.160 --> 27:04.560
it felt like they didn't fire him enough it was like no one was great they were

27:04.560 --> 27:08.320
having a bad week they're like that day I fired Adam Goldberg I knew I did

27:08.320 --> 27:13.080
something right that day I think that's what heroin must be like it is this

27:13.080 --> 27:17.060
feeling of serotonin pouring down my spine you're just trying to reclaim the

27:17.060 --> 27:22.160
first time you fired under under any pretext get him back in my office no

27:22.160 --> 27:27.800
people don't know this but I gotta get that fix back yeah okay you fire Adam

27:27.800 --> 27:30.560
Goldberg in the beginning because it feels good then you just do it to feel

27:30.560 --> 27:36.960
like yourself but you know but then you but then you're you're chasing that

27:36.960 --> 27:42.080
dragon it's never as good I can't even I can't even get through the day with

27:42.080 --> 27:47.960
that fire falling asleep with the wheel and I only he done firing Adam Goldberg

27:47.960 --> 27:54.000
I died with a smile on my face the problem is he'd also be your drug dealer

27:54.000 --> 27:59.080
like you lay on him to show up yeah I get that you have to hang out with him

27:59.080 --> 28:06.900
at a bar and shit I your segment is over Adam remember the happy

28:06.900 --> 28:10.000
ending yeah I know I know we're just fucking with you because it's a little

28:10.000 --> 28:14.240
part of the fun event I did laugh at your critters reference because I love

28:14.240 --> 28:16.880
that movie and though it was one of the first movies that Emily and I watched

28:16.880 --> 28:22.240
together critters yes it's sad as your brain dies the set was among the sad

28:22.240 --> 28:26.520
things are that everything you're referencing this is me at 38 I would

28:26.520 --> 28:29.600
say I was going like it's a bummer that everything in my brain that I used to

28:29.600 --> 28:33.520
make a point is now absolutely unknown to most of the people that I'm talking to

28:33.520 --> 28:38.320
the sadder thing is as you just witnessed at 41 I couldn't quite think of the

28:38.320 --> 28:43.480
word critters anymore now that's going away I should embrace that just become

28:43.480 --> 28:48.360
16 again and go like well well you know just get into fucking yeah lady boo boo

28:48.360 --> 28:54.120
or whatever they're listening to and like me it's an invitation lady boo boo I

28:54.120 --> 28:57.000
think it's my league Gaga

28:57.000 --> 29:02.800
lady boo boo ironically or it's appropriate the only young hip reference

29:02.800 --> 29:11.680
you know is the show you created that's the only and that's getting old no it's

29:11.680 --> 29:15.400
not that's so it's good that it got old guys we spent it died young you would

29:15.400 --> 29:17.720
have hated that set me a link I didn't get a chance to listen to it because in

29:17.720 --> 29:21.640
the car that Ben Folds Ben Folds made a song about community or something miss

29:21.640 --> 29:25.880
like what give me yeah no Ben Folds he did it yeah for the ass crack bandit

29:25.880 --> 29:35.160
episode he did a really great low rent Leonard Cohen like a song like I got to

29:35.160 --> 29:40.480
I got to talk to Ben Folds on the phone and talk to him about the concept and

29:40.480 --> 29:44.680
then he he did this thing and one of our writers Eric Summers just sent him like

29:44.680 --> 29:50.680
80 paragraphs of lyrics areas about dropping coins into

29:50.680 --> 29:57.120
ass cracks and I think he literally put all of them into this incredibly

29:57.120 --> 30:01.320
shamefully toe-tapping song like it's just like it's got all these hooks to

30:01.320 --> 30:05.320
it and it's like it's about an ass crack bandit that puts quarters down your

30:05.320 --> 30:12.400
butt and I but I I also I you know I jumped on the opportunity Aaron's a big

30:12.400 --> 30:19.200
fan of Ben Folds bigger bigger fan than me certainly a better fan than me and so

30:19.200 --> 30:25.800
I finagled an opportunity to go to dinner with him and and I would say I

30:25.800 --> 30:30.800
don't think it's premature to say that that we're friends and that you invite

30:30.800 --> 30:36.680
Aaron to yeah yeah yeah okay no but she's just sending her pictures of you

30:36.680 --> 30:40.960
guys hanging out the weird thing is that I think because and I don't want to

30:40.960 --> 30:44.840
overanalyze or suffocate this new relationship that I'm that is just

30:44.840 --> 30:50.600
blooming but I think that the fact that I know nothing about music and that and

30:50.600 --> 30:54.040
that he doesn't really know he's not a writer like is allowing us to be really

30:54.040 --> 30:57.920
pretentious with each other in texts and like instant messages and things so I

30:57.920 --> 31:02.760
could go like what do you mean you're practicing your concerto and oh and he

31:02.760 --> 31:06.560
can be like well he doesn't have to worry because he's not talking to Warren

31:06.560 --> 31:15.640
Zevon or something and for a good reason Warren Zevon writing that down did

31:15.640 --> 31:24.840
you die in 1976 that's burning up the charts right I thought that was a

31:24.840 --> 31:28.440
pretty good stab at somebody that might intimidate Ben fold well he's dead but

31:28.440 --> 31:35.680
that's right but I got you know let me just let me just yell out over your

31:35.680 --> 31:40.760
having fun mocking me I like I want to challenge you to see how obscure 70s

31:40.760 --> 31:48.360
80s you can go Warren Zevon is like is awesome yeah I was great he knew he was

31:48.360 --> 31:51.840
gonna die he got lung cancer and they were like you have like a couple months

31:51.840 --> 31:55.600
so he recorded his last album it's called the wind knowing he was gonna die

31:55.600 --> 31:57.880
and he's like all right well this is the last thing I'm gonna make and it's

31:57.880 --> 32:02.640
awesome it's full of joy and like really funny and he has like a bunch of his

32:02.640 --> 32:06.160
friends on it Bruce Springsteen it's a fucking great album the wind wasn't do

32:06.160 --> 32:12.080
it who's the guy that that turned down that and that gig I think Ben fold's

32:12.080 --> 32:19.200
turned it down he was it had to be Gene Simmons right yeah no man kiss doesn't

32:19.200 --> 32:26.680
get the joke kiss doesn't relate to mortality kiss lives forever I don't

32:26.680 --> 32:30.760
understand what you say in your diet he wanted to come sing on your album he

32:30.760 --> 32:37.720
was a demon if you're dying it's probably my doing he when he found out he

32:37.720 --> 32:41.200
was gonna die he held a press conference and this is before casino Royale came

32:41.200 --> 32:45.400
out and he said in his press conference I just want to live long enough to see

32:45.400 --> 32:50.320

32:50.320 --> 32:55.600
casino Royale was great wow yeah he's and with that statement he took press

32:55.600 --> 32:59.560
conferences and death in a new direction yeah that is a new way to handle

32:59.560 --> 33:03.880
going out and then the other people at the Bond film like guys did you hear

33:03.880 --> 33:07.080

33:34.760 --> 33:43.320
Bond boner I don't want look everybody this is the worst intro of all time

33:43.320 --> 33:48.400
I he's already killed on stage and he hasn't been on yet this is this is if

33:48.400 --> 33:51.720

favorite Pokemon Ben Vereen what's one of his powers Pippin and Robert Keown by

34:36.080 --> 34:40.800
the way every single thing you've talked about on stage I it was like a laundry

34:40.800 --> 34:44.160
list of things that I've been thinking about today like the Uber thing really

34:44.160 --> 34:50.680
yeah the uber thing the Facebook thing Quincy fucking fucks out west but the

34:50.680 --> 34:55.280
uber thing I oh I hate that dude they're like trying so hard to get first of all

34:55.280 --> 35:00.200
it's very hard to complain about a thing that a lot of people can't afford and

35:00.200 --> 35:04.920
you literally I've made a sort of a cottage industry out of that sure but

35:04.920 --> 35:08.720
you're also literally complaining our people opening too many doors for I

35:08.720 --> 35:12.640
know I know I know I should I should I should have called this segment like

35:12.640 --> 35:16.120
things I can't complain about blah blah blah but I wanted to change it up but but

35:16.120 --> 35:19.520
I mean fuck it you gotta you gotta own it I'll you know what I'm gonna do I'm

35:19.520 --> 35:22.560
gonna I'm gonna find a good charity I'm gonna start giving the fuck to it and

35:22.560 --> 35:26.480
then I'm gonna complain about that like I'll something I can do to high road

35:26.480 --> 35:29.760
people I can go like hey how many people have you fed this week yeah but I agree

35:29.760 --> 35:32.920
with you because I think they're like twice they want to like try and talk I

35:32.920 --> 35:37.040
was like I'll give you five stars just for not talking to me like don't make an

35:37.040 --> 35:43.320
effort and I don't want to found sound xenophobic but bond villains from the

35:43.320 --> 35:51.200
Uber driver all their names their names are yeah old olgar yeah I'm not joking I

35:51.200 --> 35:57.960
had an Uber driver named stub north we got it we're gonna start this tumblr

35:57.960 --> 36:02.720
blog before somebody else does driver names I take screen captures of my

36:02.720 --> 36:08.840
got gore all gay all gay that's like who was a young very handsome straight guy

36:08.840 --> 36:17.400
I got a Tejas Tejas yeah that's lift lift a big Latin for a bond

36:17.400 --> 36:27.400
villain I couldn't tell if that was a last name or a share or a guy who's had a

36:27.400 --> 36:32.000
long day and he has one joy and it's coming up with a hilarious new name

36:32.000 --> 36:36.960
every time every day there's a lot of what looks like Karen but I think they

36:36.960 --> 36:41.200
would prefer you pronounce it Karen that's a like a guy I don't know if

36:41.200 --> 36:46.280
that's an Armenian are they all like like like Central like Eastern European

36:46.280 --> 36:50.080
these types of a lot of Armenian lot of Eastern European and I had this guy

36:50.080 --> 36:55.320
yesterday his name was eddick like Eric but with a D instead of the R cuz fuck

36:55.320 --> 37:02.160
everybody and he was so sinister he was like you have to he was like you have to

37:02.160 --> 37:06.840
give me five-star last week my rating for the deactivated me if my rating was

37:06.840 --> 37:10.280
too low and he kept asking me like how are you doing my friend like it was

37:10.280 --> 37:17.640
like every stop buddy keeps looking over and he goes just asked me do do you

37:17.640 --> 37:24.320
expect me to talk I'm not gonna say it I was just like do you expect me to get

37:24.320 --> 37:32.240
into your destination yeah but speaking of which that brings up an

37:32.240 --> 37:36.160
interesting point because I was also like I kept one of my other complaints

37:36.160 --> 37:40.440
about Uber which I've now dropped was that you the whole appeal of this thing

37:40.440 --> 37:44.200
is that it's an app it's not a cab you hit a button they come get you they're

37:44.200 --> 37:49.600
like a drone you know like like and and and and I kept complaining because every

37:49.600 --> 37:57.680
time I did it hello it's it's it's Goron where do you what what address are

37:57.680 --> 38:01.240
you at yeah and you do want to pick up a thing yeah this is sounding a lot like a

38:01.240 --> 38:05.440
conversation between me and a cab driver at this point and and I was like

38:05.440 --> 38:09.400
why did why do they have to do that and then my friend Wade Randolph Rick and

38:09.400 --> 38:13.640
Morty writers said you know why they do that because in New York recently a

38:13.640 --> 38:17.760
New Year's Eve there now it's like this is the thing about what the like

38:17.760 --> 38:21.920
let's segue into this conversation this this brave new world with all the apps

38:21.920 --> 38:25.920
that are revolutionizing capitalism they're also like kind of I mean they're

38:25.920 --> 38:30.040
a little unregulated it's the Wild West and that's fucking there's crazy shit

38:30.040 --> 38:33.000
happening it's like it's like gangs in New York with the fire departments like

38:33.000 --> 38:39.840
that I think it was Uber that had the blood on its hands Uber did this to

38:39.840 --> 38:45.240
lift they on New Year's Eve they had a bunch of people just order lifts and

38:45.240 --> 38:51.080
send them to look for it to remote locations where there was no passenger

38:51.080 --> 38:55.760
so the only person getting fucked over is is the driver who's who's makes no

38:55.760 --> 38:59.680
money and how has they all these canceled fairs and they just they just did

38:59.680 --> 39:03.920
this this is what I heard I don't know Google it and correct me on Twitter I

39:03.920 --> 39:07.040
saw like a teaser for a piece and that and CNN and I didn't get to see it by

39:07.040 --> 39:10.520
there was a little hubbub so when the guy calls you and says are you really

39:10.520 --> 39:15.760
there like that's not that's how I perceive it yes I am buddy I am yeah I'm

39:15.760 --> 39:21.640
here all over headquarters I mean Dan I'm always gonna be here okay I'm never

39:21.640 --> 39:28.000
gonna are you going to break my heart I don't understand when I hear that story

39:28.000 --> 39:32.920
I don't quite understand how the calling you and verifying you could still be an

39:32.920 --> 39:36.600
imposter yeah if you're enough of an asshole to take money from a from a

39:36.600 --> 39:42.920
from a web 3.0 limo service yeah I'm still at the Empire State Building swear

39:42.920 --> 39:50.560
to God matter of fact my foot's bleeding now like why you know why not be

39:50.560 --> 39:54.680
my driver never came your driver stub Nortz yeah sure

39:54.680 --> 40:06.040
it's what his name is nice fella I can spell it for me against up you be just

40:06.040 --> 40:11.720
like it sounds step north what is the most common spelling of step north is

40:11.720 --> 40:16.360
he hungarian what is that I don't know I didn't we didn't have that stuff no it's

40:16.360 --> 40:22.640
st u b n or tz fucking right on up north step north well I'm on that topic though

40:22.640 --> 40:25.240
about drivers getting fucked over because of this new convenient thing

40:25.240 --> 40:28.840
where we're all having guys open doors for us just one more thing this is how

40:28.840 --> 40:32.880
I offset my way people problems like complaints is by sticking up for the

40:32.880 --> 40:35.800
fucking man and say fuck the system then before I go home to my mansion and

40:35.800 --> 40:42.040
jerk off into a laptop there was an article about some somebody went

40:42.040 --> 40:45.720
undercover and did that went to it went worked at Amazon at one of their

40:45.720 --> 40:50.600
warehouses oh I heard about this yeah and I have this is all second hand I

40:50.600 --> 40:55.360
don't read anything I get all my news from someone in a writer's room and I

40:55.360 --> 40:59.400
just trust them yeah but they were talking about this article this person

40:59.400 --> 41:04.840
goes undercover and works for a while at Amazon and it and and describes it as

41:04.840 --> 41:09.440
being like this insane Orwellian prison where because the technology now allows

41:09.440 --> 41:16.200
them to track their workers with with laser precision GPS and and and hold

41:16.200 --> 41:21.800
them accountable to every second of their time like like like you have 30

41:21.800 --> 41:25.480
seconds to make this delivery like like like get this bin over to that bin and

41:25.480 --> 41:29.280
if you every second over 30 seconds comes out of your pay or something it's

41:29.280 --> 41:32.520
stuff that makes you wonder how could this possibly be fair and I guess the

41:32.520 --> 41:37.680
answer is just because well who money's changing hands and wake we're not someone

41:37.680 --> 41:41.600
was telling me at Disney World or Disneyland I know Amanda used to work

41:41.600 --> 41:46.280
there I did too for 13 oh you did someone told me this somebody was working

41:46.280 --> 41:51.240
then they said that they every day they rank every single employee in the theme

41:51.240 --> 41:57.600
park and so you but literally everyone I know that yeah I am DB ranking where

41:57.600 --> 42:01.640
yeah your star meter it's kind of like 12 years a slave a little bit like

42:01.640 --> 42:08.200
that's what they did in that movie they took them to Disneyland I stopped

42:08.200 --> 42:19.920
sort of it ends well it's a right call it's a very small world it's a cage

42:19.920 --> 42:27.880
that's it I can't wait for it to get out a headline so comics stop making slave

42:27.880 --> 42:33.280
jokes yeah I'm not jumping on you I'm just saying like we're all we're all in

42:33.280 --> 42:37.080
bad we're all in trouble here oh yeah in our riffing you know all four of us are

42:37.080 --> 42:45.920
going through ride puns for slavery I've got one from his no-space Mountain I'm

42:45.920 --> 42:49.320
not doing it I'm not getting so much trouble I'm not doing just cuz I can't

42:49.320 --> 42:57.600
think of one I've got five how we deal with trauma hundreds of years after we

42:57.600 --> 43:02.720
wouldn't have suffered through it anyway I would be racist I just don't know how

43:02.720 --> 43:11.800
you guys have you guys been on the underground Matterhorn it saved a lot

43:11.800 --> 43:21.920
of people a lot of yeti's are saved I have four more I'm gonna piece them out

43:21.920 --> 43:26.120
throughout the show okay okay I will say this I changed my Facebook profile to

43:26.120 --> 43:30.600
like a comedian profile here we go friends to fans this is what I needed it

43:30.600 --> 43:36.480
ruined Facebook for me everything stopped working nobody emails me there

43:36.480 --> 43:41.560
anymore my wall is fucked because your friends are like fuck you well I don't

43:41.560 --> 43:45.400
even know it converted them but now it's different so it's not like a back and

43:45.400 --> 43:49.720
forth it's like they can say stuff to me but I can't really it's weird it's more

43:49.720 --> 43:53.560
like a bulletin board than like a right thing that I can really do you get to

43:53.560 --> 43:56.960
can you do two things where you're just like a regular guy or you have your

43:56.960 --> 44:02.200
Clark Kent you can limit your privacy settings down to only people that you

44:02.200 --> 44:07.560
say absolutely you don't have to allow the the entire world it's split mine I

44:07.560 --> 44:10.800
have two profiles and I don't know what to do with either one because I had the

44:10.800 --> 44:13.800
one and I converted it and now I have two and I don't know if the other one is

44:13.800 --> 44:17.880
an old version of me or if it's someone else

44:17.880 --> 44:23.080
pretending to be me we're gonna clean up this internet man we're gonna get some

44:23.080 --> 44:29.040
kind of government to eliminate the neutrality of this thing that's crazy

44:29.040 --> 44:35.160
stuff I it's too we need to get a net neutrality guy and I Aaron has a

44:35.160 --> 44:40.660
friend who is passionate about this stuff Eddie Geller I think his name is we

44:40.660 --> 44:43.480
gotta we gotta we gotta we gotta get some net neutrality people out here I

44:43.480 --> 44:47.280
gotta get invested in that stuff too I gotta grow up I'm 41 years old I gotta

44:47.280 --> 44:51.840
stop I gotta stop complaining about I don't have to stop complaining about how

44:51.840 --> 44:55.800
much it hurts to jerk off and and how hard it is to have doors open for me but

44:55.800 --> 45:02.920
I have to add some responsibility to that why does wait sorry we have we

45:02.920 --> 45:06.960
have jerk off questions we have we have follow-ups hi Matt Gorley Newsweek

45:06.960 --> 45:17.360
magazine why to why why does it hurt to jerk off follow-up question why am I

45:17.360 --> 45:22.400
asking this I would I was I was being hyperbolic and thinking of the most

45:22.400 --> 45:25.200
ridiculous thing that you can ever complain about would be it would be how

45:25.200 --> 45:29.200
much it hurts to jerk off because I ostensibly the answer the question would

45:29.200 --> 45:33.760
be that you jerked off so much I haven't experienced this since I was like 21

45:33.760 --> 45:38.000
yeah where it's just like Sunday afternoon and you're just like more

45:38.000 --> 45:42.160
all right yeah I'd like to see the rest of my time to my distinguished color

45:42.160 --> 45:49.240
let's let's go till nothing comes out you said you were jerking off into your

45:49.240 --> 45:57.520
laptop is that why Aaron got you a waterproof thing for your iPad again

45:57.520 --> 46:01.600
it's just it's all hyperbolic language and yeah but many a truth is said in

46:01.600 --> 46:14.840
just Dan well I mean you're a racist no Disneyland with their new ride did I

46:14.840 --> 46:18.280
don't have any more shit he said he had four more I mean there was a pirate to

46:18.280 --> 46:24.160
the Caribbean that I backed off on because it got weird what last month

46:24.160 --> 46:31.800
okay now it's getting too dark all right that's it wait why why why was why is

46:31.800 --> 46:37.320
this Disneyland ranking like this is what I heard I don't know like like Dan I

46:37.320 --> 46:42.160
hear facts and then I take them to be true and then spread them and then add to

46:42.160 --> 46:47.640
them and so just please cut out the stuff where I'm not sure about this just

46:47.640 --> 46:52.680
to just so that you see like oh I'm only 135 I gotta get up top and then there's

46:52.680 --> 46:55.560
certain people who are go-getters who are like higher up so you like get a

46:55.560 --> 46:59.440
thing like like you were 200 today that's not good don't you want to be

46:59.440 --> 47:03.000
higher than that like that kind of stuff do you know are they people voting for

47:03.000 --> 47:06.880
each other or no it's because they can track like how much work you've done and

47:06.880 --> 47:10.480
all this stuff but I mean how are they measuring and how are they comparing like

47:10.480 --> 47:15.000
the guy that sells the ostrich legs to the guy that's running the roller

47:15.000 --> 47:20.520
coaster okay I would have to go talk to the person who I don't I don't even

47:20.520 --> 47:28.520
remember who it was it could have been a dream I once had yeah they never like

47:28.520 --> 47:31.880
would come up to you and pin a little number on your chest okay you can do

47:31.880 --> 47:37.680
better Jim come on we should have a segment people I get corrected all the

47:37.680 --> 47:44.000
time I get I say five horribly erroneous things and pass them off I made the

47:44.000 --> 47:46.520
mistake of looking at the internet like you get corrected on every little

47:46.520 --> 47:50.320
bloody thing I miss we misspeak all the time word you should try doing a James

47:50.320 --> 47:54.560
Bond podcast those people do not let a thing go by what's it what's it called

47:54.560 --> 47:58.040
in James bonding James bonding yeah I can imagine they come after you with

47:58.040 --> 48:01.440
actually you should not try doing it but I will say this there's another side to

48:01.440 --> 48:05.040
that culture like like it's like this emerging internet age I think I feel like

48:05.040 --> 48:09.200
Reddit is the represents it the most like a personality wise you know every

48:09.200 --> 48:12.720
we've talked about every social every social platform has its own personality

48:12.720 --> 48:20.440
tumblr is a is a very like a passionate young lady and and and reddit and

48:20.440 --> 48:27.600
reddit is a very stoic guy in a Vulcan costume who's who's playing 3d chess with

48:27.600 --> 48:31.320
with someone and I didn't mean to get gender-specific there and but I'll

48:31.320 --> 48:35.880
hear about that on both of those platforms in very different ways yes one

48:35.880 --> 48:44.720
with a both address it in their own way Instagram is a cat my account is but

48:44.720 --> 48:49.640
reddit reddit has it's like like like so so for instance of like like if I'm up

48:49.640 --> 48:52.680
here spouting nonsense and I go like you know you hear what happened in

48:52.680 --> 48:56.320
Columbia all these five guys got chainsawed my cobra ate them and the

48:56.320 --> 48:59.520
Amazon was responsible and blah blah blah not I just blah blah blah and I'm

48:59.520 --> 49:02.800
drunk and I go home and I sleep like a baby I get up and look on Twitter and

49:02.800 --> 49:06.280
people correct me and there's there's a there's a curator personality that's

49:06.280 --> 49:09.920
has a higher sense of social and informational responsibility these are

49:09.920 --> 49:13.120
good people these are people who protect us historically from people like

49:13.120 --> 49:16.720
churches that are gonna burn women it's at the stake and things like that it's

49:16.720 --> 49:21.360
a logic skepticism and don't don't don't go off half-cocked and like like

49:21.360 --> 49:28.280
however and like the other side of that is this dumb Starbucks thing there's a

49:28.280 --> 49:35.360
I went to the reddit thread discussing dumb Starbucks well it was like it was

49:35.360 --> 49:40.680
eight pages of just a bunch of people not able to have fun with like the

49:40.680 --> 49:44.360
simplest thing in the world but I don't know what's going I think I think their

49:44.360 --> 49:48.600
point is that privacy laws were overlaps with everybody well that's not true

49:48.600 --> 49:51.200
they were making that point then that wouldn't be a way to make that point I

49:51.200 --> 49:54.480
think it's if it's parody that's an incorrect use of those it's just

49:54.480 --> 49:58.800
everybody gathering around this thing and failing to that's just a whatever it

49:58.800 --> 50:02.520
is I don't know if it's Nathan for you or Banksy or whoever the fuck it is but

50:02.520 --> 50:05.480
somebody's telling a joke somebody's just putting dumb in front of Starbucks

50:05.480 --> 50:10.840
and and and that's basically it you could you can have all levels of fun with

50:10.840 --> 50:14.440
that but you definitely are never gonna digest that with the enzymes of

50:14.440 --> 50:18.800
intellectual logical discussion and they actually missed out on something but I

50:18.800 --> 50:21.760
also feel like the correcting even if it's not like that like I do a video game

50:21.760 --> 50:26.320
podcast and that I bet rivals maybe like maybe even more we'll be like oh

50:26.320 --> 50:31.360
Super Mario 3d world on the Gameboy advanced and 10 people like actually

50:31.360 --> 50:35.680
that was on Gameboy color like what is anybody gaining from that I'm sorry we

50:35.680 --> 50:38.840
miss both it's it's something that's written in the tweets it's the tone but

50:38.840 --> 50:44.480
I heard a Goldberg correcting what I just said Goldberg is one of the he's like

50:44.480 --> 50:49.960
cyber Christ he brings like he brings the phenomenon of getting corrected on

50:49.960 --> 50:54.880
Twitter into real life can we call this show cyber Christ and Stubnortz

50:54.880 --> 50:59.920
cyber Christ Stubnortz cyber Christ and Stubnortz and then we have to

50:59.920 --> 51:03.520
actually write a play and do for our hundreds upcoming show we're gonna do a

51:03.520 --> 51:10.480
live play called cyber Christ and Stubnortz okay okay what if we could

51:10.480 --> 51:14.440
track down Stubnortz like is there a way to request a driver or something on

51:14.440 --> 51:18.160
Uber I don't I don't know you gotta request a specific because that's the

51:18.160 --> 51:22.800
thing is like by the way this happened once this is a city sorry go ahead Uber

51:22.800 --> 51:29.200
thing Emily got it a person I we Emily and I were hanging out she got an Uber

51:29.200 --> 51:32.720
driver he dropped her home he called her talked to her and then she texted me

51:32.720 --> 51:37.200
like I'm home the doors unlocked to me but she by mistake texted the Uber

51:37.200 --> 51:42.800
driver and she noticed and she said oh sorry not meant for you and he said no

51:42.800 --> 51:58.000
no I like in our top story two straight weeks the

51:58.000 --> 52:14.360
Uber bandit is still at large she locked the door from that on out my my

52:14.360 --> 52:22.240
cackle is too is too non-sympathetic I'm laughing at the whatever at the terror

52:22.240 --> 52:26.160
that is a bummer yeah it's a real bummer because wasn't I mean I mean again

52:26.160 --> 52:28.840
that this might all be bullshit too and this might have been a smear campaign

52:28.840 --> 52:31.680
wasn't it in the very early days of the bird there was some sexual harassing

52:31.680 --> 52:38.560
going on or something or rapes that's that's worse I've never seen an

52:38.560 --> 52:43.840
Uber driver with less than a 4.5 no they have to give them lower than that if

52:43.840 --> 52:50.880
that happened to you right I reckon what is a rape star rating these days I'm

52:50.880 --> 53:00.240
out I'm out the but there's a part of the system this is another thing that

53:00.240 --> 53:03.680
kind of like well is that this is for the consumers benefit but then what kind

53:03.680 --> 53:10.080
of terror are we creating among the worker it the the way it works I'm

53:10.080 --> 53:18.120
told is that if they drop below a 4.5 they get there they can't they can't

53:18.120 --> 53:24.200
get no Uber business no more ever again they're out of the club and so

53:24.200 --> 53:29.480
they're terrified which is nice for all of us who have ever taken a cab over the

53:29.480 --> 53:33.600
last 30 years it's a nice little slipper to put your foot in for a change of pace

53:33.600 --> 53:38.720
a driver coming to pick you up who's a little frightened that he might not

53:38.720 --> 53:42.840
satisfy you with your driving experience that's that's that's a welcome

53:42.840 --> 53:47.200
welcome change but then you kind of over time you're kind of like well Jesus

53:47.200 --> 53:51.120
Christ what is this you know like like I don't know I feel bad I never give

53:51.120 --> 53:55.760
anyone less than a five now I feel like that's the new tip because I'm like well

53:55.760 --> 54:01.840
he kind of was a four but what am I doing who am I like like what am I am I am

54:01.840 --> 54:06.880
I Simon Cowell like I what do I know about driving fucking five you tried

54:06.880 --> 54:12.920
you'd give it your shot it's anyways I'm done talking so the only rating you

54:12.920 --> 54:17.600
can give them is either a five or I think that would get them fired yeah that's

54:17.600 --> 54:22.040
the second highest rating you can give them well well I know it's average yeah

54:22.040 --> 54:25.160
in a theoretical sense yeah I guess we need a mathematician to come up here and

54:25.160 --> 54:28.840
but but but yeah you're you would be giving them a number that if everyone

54:28.840 --> 54:32.960
else gave them that number they would be gone it kind of does it but I think I

54:32.960 --> 54:36.240
guess they figured that into their algorithm that people are gonna tend to

54:36.240 --> 54:40.760
give you a five I guess like I would not want to give in a number to someone

54:40.760 --> 54:44.480
that would get them fired like no that's why you give them fives well that's a

54:44.480 --> 54:50.600
like wake I've never I've never under I've I've I've I have had horrible people

54:50.600 --> 54:53.520
wait on me in restaurants we all have we've all had they've been busy they've

54:53.520 --> 54:57.760
they've been bad people they've been bad at their job I've I've never crossed a

54:57.760 --> 55:01.320
threshold where I'm like here's your dollar for your tip like I always just

55:01.320 --> 55:05.280
like I just go okay I'm because I've seen too many goddamn monologues and

55:05.280 --> 55:09.000
reservoir dogs and all this shit about you know that it's part they get taxed

55:09.000 --> 55:12.840
and all this stuff and it's hard for them and it's like I'm not gonna carry

55:12.840 --> 55:19.000
that that relationship into finance so I'm tipping you 20% even though you suck

55:19.000 --> 55:23.040
and I just hate you because you suck but here's your 20% and it becomes

55:23.040 --> 55:26.760
systematized that's to say like here's your five stars you were 10 minutes late

55:26.760 --> 55:32.000
and boy I'm really on a tear about something I'm not like blowing anybody's

55:32.000 --> 55:34.640
mind by saying like like you like we've talked about before like you have a lot

55:34.640 --> 55:38.880
of instant crisis like like sensation when you're talking with what you're

55:38.880 --> 55:42.200
dealing with strangers or even with people that aren't strangers like but to

55:42.200 --> 55:45.040
the extent that somebody is a stranger and there is a transaction that has to

55:45.040 --> 55:49.200
happen right and I talked about this on Ali Georgia slumber party when I was when

55:49.200 --> 55:53.360
I went on that this is like this is my Stanley rectangle in the upper panel

55:53.360 --> 56:00.120
saying check out that issue of Hulk you know he fought the Submariner that's

56:00.120 --> 56:07.400
that's why he's calling him fish face they've met before the I explain it

56:07.400 --> 56:19.600
some more Dan the name more that's the name of the guy I'm sorry continue what

56:19.600 --> 56:27.520
can I leave I know I know his name is Prince there I'm offended but anyways

56:27.520 --> 56:42.280
actually it's Prince name I'm at my house in Los Feliz I order an Uber it's

56:42.280 --> 56:48.760
like ordering honey in a beehive there's a lot of black cars in Los Feliz there's

56:48.760 --> 56:55.480
a lot of limo drivers living in my neighborhood and and when and if one of

56:55.480 --> 57:02.160
them's bad I he's not only my neighbor but he's bad and I can't I'm stuck in a

57:02.160 --> 57:05.480
horrible position he has your credit card information he knows where you live I

57:05.480 --> 57:09.200
don't think yeah I don't I don't extend it even way before that I don't think

he's gonna knife my dog or steal money from my

57:12.520 --> 57:15.360
electronically I don't think it's like hackers or something I'm just saying

like I can't socially I can't I'm gonna see him again yeah and it does he know

57:21.440 --> 57:29.600
that I gave him a that I'm they do know weighing his life and I'm on ISIS's

57:29.600 --> 57:36.160
scales they rate you too do they yeah you get a rating too so will they not

57:36.160 --> 57:39.440

Michael who didn't get any of the jokes who's eating carrots listening to this

58:27.360 --> 58:33.680
and you just blew his mind about that like if you just took that one yeah

58:33.680 --> 58:37.680
like like if you you have a TV show a basic cable and you just I think we're

58:37.680 --> 58:40.320
talking about something Rick and Morty's room or faith healers do that where you

58:40.320 --> 58:44.320
just like you just look out at the camera and just go hey Todd that's our

58:44.320 --> 58:47.760
we're talking about having Rick like just look at the camera yeah at one point

58:47.760 --> 58:51.680
and go like oh because we're talking about how people I'll over read it where

58:51.680 --> 58:55.280
there was a recent episode of Rick and Morty where there was so many people

58:55.280 --> 58:57.800
that were recommending you got to get you got to watch Rick and Morty but you

58:57.800 --> 59:01.560
got to get high man you got to get high and then we did this episode where

59:01.560 --> 59:05.440
Morty ends up burying his dead self from another time line in the backyard

59:05.440 --> 59:09.200
so he takes place and Mazzie stars look on down from the bridges playing as an

59:09.200 --> 59:13.360
MOS shot of him walking through his house observing a life that he does not

59:13.360 --> 59:17.560
belong to him but that no one will ever notice that he's he's injured and I was

59:17.560 --> 59:21.560
amazing the amount of people over the Internet like okay don't get high I told

59:21.560 --> 59:25.560
you to get high when he wants his show man I'm telling you not to get high my

59:25.560 --> 59:30.560
friend's dad okay so we were joking about how we're like like Rick could be

59:30.560 --> 59:35.080
talking to see he's like I'm telling you Morty it's uh you know we gotta go to a

59:35.080 --> 59:38.360
different dimension Morty and it's gonna be fucked up I don't recommend you get

59:38.360 --> 59:45.160
high Todd Johnson and just look into the look at the camera and then it's just

59:45.160 --> 59:49.680
like right that statistical oh yeah like okay there's two million people may be

59:49.680 --> 59:54.360
watching it's like Todd Johnson eating your peas they're like let's just fuck

59:54.360 --> 59:59.960
him up forever I watch a lot of I watch a lot of religious television late at

59:59.960 --> 01:00:05.600
night and the faith healers on there I just good there's no better TV exception

01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:11.240
included you they will do things like the faith who will look at the camera and

01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:14.640
say there's there's a woman named Marjorie out there and she has a type of lung

01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:18.760
cancer and I'm gonna focus on her right now and he went away of course either

01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:22.800
falls on a Marjorie that has lung cancer or everybody out there is believing that

01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:26.840
there's a Marjorie out there. That's like cold reading with no risk that's like that's

01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:30.600
like that's cheating I never even thought about that it's all of course you can do that

01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:33.960
though they used to do that on like romper room my mom told me about that she

01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:37.040
said like there would be like a magnifying glass that they would pick up

01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:41.160
and and look through it and they'd go I see Lisa I could see Lisa I could see

01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:45.200
Tony Tony just stop picking on your sister so I guess that's yeah until you

01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:49.160
start fucking charging for it who's the guy who was on TV and it was like

01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:53.440
crossing the bridge or something like that crossing over Edwards yeah and he

01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:58.200
would be like um I could send someone oh he's here his name starts with a T yeah

01:00:58.200 --> 01:01:01.600
and I was imagined like the ghosts are there but they don't even want to talk

01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:05.320
to these assholes you know like what's your name it's something with a T you

01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:11.640
douchebag I really I was listening to the radio the other day and someone was

01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:15.520
it was a numerologist on this is gonna sort of reveal maybe how close-minded I

01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:18.640
am but he was talking about like if you take your birthday then you multiply it

01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:22.960
by this and this and I got so angry listening to this guy that's not close

01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:26.960
minded that's just being sensible not as close-minded as someone who listens to

01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:36.000
the radio give your computer a chance it's got radio emulators on it he's

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:40.520
just mad at you because it sounds smart Camille I just didn't get it I just it

01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:44.760
just bugged me so much that's crazy because I do think these psychics are

01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:49.680
like they're praying on people who are in moments of weakness that's what they do

01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:53.400
I think that's a really interesting point because it's like the guys in my

01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:57.400
position so if somebody ever tells me I'm not allowed to that I have some

01:01:57.400 --> 01:02:02.160
accountability when someone when someone tweets at me or it says like you made a

01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:07.280
you made a polio joke on your show last night you need to not I'm offended all

01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:11.680
this stuff my instant reaction is to go go fuck yourself you're watching TV wrong

01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:16.400
you don't take it so seriously and all this stuff but I'm I'm I'm I'm I want

01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:24.800
people to care about what I'm putting out there and and and and if there is

01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:29.240
a responsibility Norman Lear knew that like like like he he's an example of

01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:33.240
somebody that took that seriously said like you know what I'm making a sitcom

01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:37.880
I can keep I can keep doing stuff the same way or I could make a sitcom for

01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:42.080
black people like like like because I want to not because I see a huge profit

01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:45.040
in it but because it's something seems wrong with what's well you know what's

01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:48.200
being presented on television we're shaping people's brains as they're

01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:52.000
watching it in today's three-year-old is tomorrow's 40-year-old and they're all

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:55.600
watching TV and they're all learning from it it's like you you high road that

01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:58.800
when people are telling you what to do and you want to you want to fall back on

01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:01.600
like you can't tell me what to do freedom of speech and all that stuff but

01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:06.240
then you also like capitalize from it yeah but also sometimes like you have to

01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:12.360
take every one of those instances at for what it is so and I do this podcast and

01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:15.560
in the intro there was one time I had hiccups it was just a couple weeks ago

01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:18.440
it was a five-minute thing and I'm I thought it was a funny thing I had

01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:21.920
hiccups and I just did a five-minute thing this one guy got really really

01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:26.760
angry at me he got really really angry at me and he kept like posting and people

01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:29.360
were like what the fuck is wrong with you kept posting like it's his

01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:35.160
responsibility to not have hiccups when he's podcasting I was like literally go

01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:40.160
fuck yourself he thought you're being unprofessional like that yeah he should

01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:43.520
have held off recording until you're done he said it grossed him out it's

01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:47.720
fucking hiccups well so yeah I mean I'm definitely not taking that guy's side

01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:54.800
but it's also it's like there are people who who like if you the sound of a

01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:59.560
fingernail being clipped might might cause them to understand that then that

01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:04.000
that that they bear that bird yeah I I have to live in a world where apparently

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:08.600
everyone but me is can't wait to see a close-up of a fucking hypodermic needle

01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:13.720
go into a goddamn arm every single time on every TV show or movie any time

01:04:13.720 --> 01:04:18.560
there's a remote excuse to do it they fucking love it I have to I have to I

01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:23.240
want to vomit I can't stand needles going into veins like fingers being cut

01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:30.840
too right you have a finger does that come up a lot not as well there's that

01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:34.880
there's that what are you doing why is your little scar I coming out of the

01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:39.840
finger that that that that Dan Ackroyd sketch where he's Julia Childs and it's

01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:45.800
it's spurting those gags severing I don't like like I can't I can't handle it

01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:49.240
it'll ruin my day and it's I do I do accept that I go something wrong with

01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:53.480
me because everyone else is laughing so but does a fucking like every movie you

01:04:53.480 --> 01:04:57.480
goddamn if it involves heroin if it involves if it's if it's if it's if

01:04:57.480 --> 01:05:01.720
it's fucking dream on and and he goes and gets a flu shot they kid they like

01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:05.880
why do you have to show it yeah I know it's coming I'm conditioned to know

01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:09.360
it's coming and I and I cover my eyes like a baby when you give blood do you

01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:17.400
are you dying I turn my head I and I start to sweat and I go I and the nurses

01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:22.880
always go are you okay because I I'm having plasma sucked out of my body

01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:27.400
siphoned out of my body like like like like I'm freaking out talking about it

01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:31.640
I don't I don't like going to the doctor I don't want to be Jim Hansen I don't

01:05:31.640 --> 01:05:39.200
want to die so I forced myself to go but I I I I I can't they did a doctor kill

01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:46.160
Jim Hansen no no he didn't go he didn't go like if I if I if I didn't know that

01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:49.920
that was possible that you could just die from not fucking going that I would

01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:53.600
just be like fine I feel fine it's just a cold or whatever but I go and they

01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:58.280
they they they they take that fucking cuff and they inflate it I learned in

01:05:58.280 --> 01:06:02.440
health class I know what's happening they they they're collapsing the walls of

01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:07.160
your artery that's how they take your blood pressure they inflate that cuff

01:06:07.160 --> 01:06:15.960
until the walls of your artery collapse and then they measure the amount that

01:06:15.960 --> 01:06:21.800
they have to release it until it reinflates allowing blood your viscera to

01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:29.480
flow back through your own arm and they they record that as a number we're like

01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:34.960
yeah I always have like I have very low blood pressure like genetically but I

01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:39.120
have normal blood pressure because the act of taking my blood pressure makes

01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:43.680
me think I'm gonna die then I start sweating they go are you alright and I

01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:50.840
go just do it just fucking do it and you can they get off on the fucking they

01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:57.800
love doing it I want like it would be so easy to torture me you could you could

01:06:57.800 --> 01:07:02.680
torture me by making me better okay that could just strap me to a chair but

01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:08.280
we're concerned about you you see you see you see pink it we're gonna take your

01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:12.840
blood pressure I'll give you the blueprints to the White House don't take

01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:18.320
my blood pressure I'm gonna freak out the taking of blood I can only get

01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:24.160
through by pretending in my head and I'm not being hyperbolic I imagine in my

01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:31.080
head that precisely that that I'm being interrogated by an enemy like that that

01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:35.400
there is an that there is like an empire that I'm part of a rebellion and

01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:39.080
they're trying to get me to tell them Todd Johnson don't get high for this

01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:44.200
podcast right now I have to imagine in my head that I'm somehow that if I just

01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:52.080
don't gel out like like I give up and and and run that I'm a hero I have to

01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:55.400
like reduce it to that like stuff so that I so I just how do you make it through

01:07:55.400 --> 01:07:58.920
the afternoon man that's the worst I don't go to the doctor every afternoon

01:07:58.920 --> 01:08:03.720
I'm living on a razor's edge steaks are so everybody's got their got their things

01:08:03.720 --> 01:08:14.480
man I'm I mine is having fucking fluid siphoned out of my body through a tube by

01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:27.000
a bureaucrat so it can be sent to a lab that's me that's mine not anymore

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:33.920
siphon you know it's site they siphon it out of your body I know they suck it

01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:37.920
and it starts to come out and then it goes into this is the this is the part

01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:41.040
where Jeff goes I love to give blood I love it I love to watch it I know I

01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:44.720
know this about him siphon is my favorite word

01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:52.840
it's more of a section but he loved he loves giving but it's so weird that

01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:57.360
when I when it happens I have to watch it because it's so fucking crazy oh they

01:08:57.360 --> 01:09:01.520
also like I love how it's made and how do they do it and those kind of shows

01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:06.760
like watching how they make those needles that's fucking fascinating and

01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:10.480
then I go what if we took a little pointy tube and you put it in your fucking

01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:17.200
body and then and then you're fucking stuff comes up it's awesome I mean it's

01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:20.520
freaky but like you have to look at it was like I don't want to not see that

01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:24.760
that's crazy yeah I never look I always look away and then and then I just can't

01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:28.360
I gotta lay there and they're like are you alright I'm like I know the last

01:09:28.360 --> 01:09:34.760
half of that statement is are you a pussy like I the answer is yes about this

01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:38.960
but I'll tell you I'll tell you one thing if you if you if you tell me what I

01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:42.200
can't write in my TV show I'll fucking tell you to fuck off I'm strong that

01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:47.360
way people at home should know that Dan has slowly been taking his clothes off

01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:53.120
while it's making it's making me lose weight thinking about you actually I'm

01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:56.280
not joking you look a little pale and a little bit like a little sweat you know

01:09:56.280 --> 01:09:58.920
what we should maybe take your blood pressure

01:09:58.920 --> 01:10:05.360
is there a doctor in the house I am really well when I had that you know

01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:08.240
who should we should have as a guest because she came to the show and she

01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:13.960
talked to me after the show I the lady that gave the that anesthetized me for

01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:21.240
my endoscopy you guys weren't as impressed by that Janice

01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:27.080
no it's just I don't know I mean I mean well because I believe me I had to go

01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:32.920
into a whole weird state of denial about having a my first actual procedure

01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:39.360
done I had never been knocked out so did you get general anesthesia I got

01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:45.560
specific to me yeah he didn't get everyone in LA

01:10:45.560 --> 01:10:49.760
no did you get the actual military officer general anesthesia he comes in

01:10:49.760 --> 01:11:02.640
and he can't afford that corporal aspirin I had my tonsils out and I was

01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:05.600
going under and they put me on anesthesia and it wasn't the medical

01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:09.320
process I was afraid of I was in a hospital where I didn't trust them if

01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:12.680
while I was under something went wrong like an earthquake already it seemed

01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:16.280
like chaos there was a woman across the way in her bed going you're gonna love

01:11:16.280 --> 01:11:22.720
this another patient another patient what's the difference between these

01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:27.880
places in a DMV exactly I don't know what they're doing

01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:36.320
years of schooling at least two more years than the DMV deal you know what

01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:41.200
I did with the last two years jack shit you can waste two years man I'm not in

01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:46.240
medical school you can't add two years to the lady at the DMV and tell me that

01:11:46.240 --> 01:11:49.720
that if my heart stops during my endoscopy they totally they tell you

01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:55.080
they make you sign all these forms these are the forms say if you start to choke

01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:59.320
to death on the tube just you can't you have to sign all this stuff because

01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:05.480
because they can open up your chest on the on the well no no no that sounds

01:12:05.480 --> 01:12:08.120
expensive that sounds like there's overhead involved you're signing the

01:12:08.120 --> 01:12:13.240
forms so that your loved ones can't sue them when you die that's why being being

01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:17.600
in the hospital during passed out during an earthquake is the safest place to be

01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:22.680
at this fit no I know man they ditch they ditch you don't don't they took it

01:12:22.680 --> 01:12:26.080
they took an oath that says they can't ditch you if you're if you're they don't

01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:31.040
give a fuck no unless you have insurance no you get your surgeries done in

01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:34.600
Orange County otherwise don't go there because I was in a hospital in Torrance

01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:40.680
and it just felt like it was gonna die the hospital felt sick that oath that

01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:46.120
oath don't hold up to no earthquake man I'm so walking dead you know how the

01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:57.720
hospital was filled with people there were no doctor zombies in walking dead

01:12:57.720 --> 01:13:00.880
when he wakes up in the hospital there's no doctor with a stethoscope going on I

01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:06.120
want to I want to listen to treat zombies did I did I say on the show

01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:09.240
already about my mom I like a year or two ago I had all four of my wisdom teeth

01:13:09.240 --> 01:13:12.520
taken out that I'm talking about this and I woke up and I and the doctor was

01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:16.480
gone I was I was they said beforehand do you want to be under local anesthesia or

01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:20.120
general anesthesia I said I don't want to be in the same country as I like that

01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:24.880
give me all you guys that happened to me last year do go ahead so I so I knew

01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:28.800
that one of them was really impacted and gonna be trouble but yeah so I woke up

01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:32.280
fine they say like kind of dress loose like don't wear like certain kinds of

01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:35.320
clothes don't wear tight clothes don't wear this that because they might have

01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:38.080
to like actually you know physically like move you around a little bit to get

01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:41.680
like you had some sort of hammerlock hole to get the shit out and so I woke up

01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:46.320
doctors gone there's the his assistant this woman was in there and I said how

01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:52.040
did it go I said okay I'm like was it was it was it hard she's like yeah it

01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:57.480
was a struggle I'm like how bad and she was like it was it was like it was hammer

01:13:57.480 --> 01:14:01.760
and tongs man I was like it was she showed me my teeth yeah were they on

01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:07.480
her necklace there's just a Turkish World War II soldier comes out of the shadows

01:14:07.480 --> 01:14:12.040
he's wearing here it was they didn't look like teeth I'll say that much those

01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:16.360
were in my head for how long that says more about you than I hadn't gone to

01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:19.840
Dennis a long time like three were fine I thought one was laying sideways so that

01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:23.200
one they really had to get in there was some fucking Byzantine shit and fucking

01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:28.560
really do you remember when I had no I'm gonna do this now okay no real quick

01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:33.640
though I this is not a joke I had defense wounds on my wrists and my belt was

01:14:33.640 --> 01:14:40.480
off okay one of those it was not a buckly belt it was one of the kind of

01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:44.600
snapping you know like oh it wouldn't take a whole lot I'm like what one I

01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:48.800
like like she's like he really had to like I think there was a point you had

01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:53.720
to really like my shirt was all fucked up there were wrinkles like like

01:14:53.720 --> 01:14:55.880
Colombo could tell if a bed has been slept in there could tell there had been

01:14:55.880 --> 01:15:00.040
a foot on my chest like he was on me and like we're bringing up the fucking

01:15:00.040 --> 01:15:06.920
heavy artillery and the only way to make a tooth in that many pieces is to get in

01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:11.400
there was just absolutely like oh man and then he didn't tell me he told me during

01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:14.920
the x-rays he goes one of your roots because you're so old now you should

01:15:14.920 --> 01:15:19.520
have just done when you're 18 now that you're 36 or 78 whatever I was you have

01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:24.400
to the root grew up your upper one it's right up to the edge of the sinus wall

01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:29.800
which is a very thin thin bone you know boy like they feel it sees that a lot of

01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:33.400
people have this to have this dentist stuff that that's the thing so he said

01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:36.240
he's like and I'm not that skirmish about this I didn't like the sound of this

01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:40.520
but he was like it's possible that when I take it out it might perforate the bone

01:15:40.520 --> 01:15:43.720
there there might be a little tiny hole in there if it is it'll heal up it'll

01:15:43.720 --> 01:15:47.360
take longer to heal than the teeth and but he goes but this is paperwork on if

01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:50.880
it happens probably won't and you're you're healthy enough to the bone will

01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:53.440
regenerate and it take a month if it does happen but don't worry about it too

01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:57.920
much so I get home I'm on every sort of medication I was just absolutely shit

01:15:57.920 --> 01:16:03.280
canned on whatever they had given me and my friend drove me home and I'm reading

01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:07.640
my paperwork and I'm changing the gauze and I get some like some broth or

01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:11.920
whatever I'm eating for my first meal and you're not allowed to swish your

01:16:11.920 --> 01:16:15.560
mouth or anything and so I kind of lean forward and I was in the sink I had a

01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:21.440
mouthful of soup and I lean forward and my soup came out of my nose because

01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:26.480
there was a little hole in the top of my mouth and I called him up in the middle

01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:31.000
like what the fuck is going on but you're the guy that can blow air out his

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:36.960
eyeballs too I can't anymore why because the hole is gone no you know I told

01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:39.840
him about that I can also you know what else is going I took out my fucking

01:16:39.840 --> 01:16:43.120
wisdom teeth I used to make a dolphin sound that would wipe you out I remember

01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:48.560
that can't do it now don't sound gone I would have thought about that if I had

01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:53.600
a chance but also the thing did heal up for a couple days he's like oh so just

01:16:53.600 --> 01:17:00.120
here's the thing don't blow your nose and do not sneeze for a month any more

01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:05.560
involuntary shit that I should know about like no breathing if you have to

01:17:05.560 --> 01:17:09.720
sneeze do it with your mouth as wide open as possible what does that look

01:17:09.720 --> 01:17:19.720
like that's like the first act of speed like somebody that's kind of

01:17:19.720 --> 01:17:24.480
vendetta against you has rigged your head look I also want to talk about the

01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:27.680
fact that I have I have what are consistent with defense wounds on my

01:17:27.680 --> 01:17:31.560
forearms from whatever fucking crisis went down in your office all right

01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:34.720
somebody's got to be the bad guy so that we can get some good good good we can

01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:38.800
move on to the good stuff I met off real quick I think he was next but

01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:43.040
mine's not important I did I see no you go ahead oh wow it's like a Mount Rushmore

01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:47.560
of deferral yeah no no no go ahead we should bring shouldn't we that's what

01:17:47.560 --> 01:17:51.880
I'm saying Spencer at his pension credit everybody

01:17:54.240 --> 01:17:59.960
let's get this sausage party continued I need I need I need to clear something

01:17:59.960 --> 01:18:07.440
up when you sneeze and turn it into a yell it sounds like because there's no

01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:11.280
chew yeah it sounds really awesome actually like you're like a super

01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:15.440
saying or something why why do you know that because I've done it before it's

01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:18.960
really funny why'd you have to do it because it's just you know you know

01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:24.240
he's so monotonous if you're just doing it the same way oh yeah I know I'm over

01:18:24.240 --> 01:18:29.720
the way I know right he's a lifehacker yeah because you you when you sneeze

01:18:29.720 --> 01:18:33.000
you're taught to condense it but if you really just stand in a field and let it

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:38.960
go it's something cathartic you sound like a polar bear I almost always

01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:43.840
stifle my sneezes perfectly ago like that yeah I feel like that must be bad

01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:47.520
for you I've always you know it goes into your brain this not goes into your

01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:54.680
brain don't look it up I mean I don't think that but I just feel like that's

01:18:54.680 --> 01:18:57.960
what I was told as a kid that's definitely not true well they say like you

01:18:57.960 --> 01:19:02.640
know anti-perspirant it's bad for you it's blocking your your sweat glands with

01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:06.640
you know what's the difference between that and stifling a sneeze I ask you

01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:16.000
don't answer move on Spencer how's how's how's how's life at home I just got

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:20.880
back I saw my cat again it was nice so we were at sketchfest not too long ago

01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:24.240
who takes care of your cat while you're out of town I got Jackson there's my

01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:28.600
roommate to feed him see I don't see him around here he used to come to the

01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:33.040
shows a lot like how do you how do you know he's a good cat sitter I don't

01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:37.480
know I just well I mean I took all the guesswork out of it I had measured out

01:19:37.480 --> 01:19:40.920
the food and put them in bags and taped them above the cat bowl and then I

01:19:40.920 --> 01:19:45.600
labeled them with times and dates because a bunch of ten bucks the hour

01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:50.040
before your flight came back they were all going in the toilet yeah empty bag

01:19:50.040 --> 01:19:55.440
time yeah it's like a cop breaking down the door of a drug dealer he's pouring

01:19:55.440 --> 01:20:01.000
it down all down the toilet I mean she was still alive so I'm good do you fly

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:08.280
a lot Spencer I mean I don't fly none I before I worked at Apple I worked at a

01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:13.000
small bookstore and occasionally like two or three times a year I'd go and fly

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:17.120
out to book conferences which are kind of like comic-cons just for ran random

01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:22.560
books it was a chance to see a big bookstore yeah what people dress up as

01:20:22.560 --> 01:20:29.080
their favorite books but the actual book yeah I don't want a dog pile and

01:20:29.080 --> 01:20:34.640
everything you say but was it a do they sell small books or is the store small

01:20:34.640 --> 01:20:42.840
is it like pamphlets and booklets or yeah and short stories all right

01:20:42.840 --> 01:20:46.160
continue until you say another combination of words that my ass burgers

01:20:46.160 --> 01:20:49.600
can jump on but I would just go and they'd sell books for cheap because it'd

01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:53.200
be like publishers trying to get down their stocks and I just go and buy like

01:20:53.200 --> 01:20:58.480
several booths and I'd you know get them all packed up and ship back to the main

01:20:58.480 --> 01:21:03.280
office oh so you would go buy them at fairs and then sell them for a profit at

01:21:03.280 --> 01:21:06.400
your yeah was there like a community of people that did this would like to do

01:21:06.400 --> 01:21:11.280
all up the same TJ Fridays like it like you're like not that I knew I'm sure if

01:21:11.280 --> 01:21:15.080
I did it for long enough there would be and then but I think they're all enemies

01:21:15.080 --> 01:21:18.280
it's like you know pond stars where it's just a bunch of trashy people selling

01:21:18.280 --> 01:21:24.400
garbage like and they're just elbowing each other for a porcelain duck but I

01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:28.640
mean it's if you're if you're making a living off of selling like reclaim

01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:33.400
stuff I don't know I don't know you guys I don't I don't love pond stars because I

01:21:33.400 --> 01:21:36.720
always feel like the people who are selling the stuff are clearly in need

01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:39.960
like they're in a bad place they're selling shit and then these guys are

01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:43.000
like talking to the camera like I got it for 300 bucks I'm gonna sell it for

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:47.120
$4,000 like and these are clearly rich people it always bugs me that it takes

01:21:47.120 --> 01:21:50.560
the side of the people who are clearly the big bad guy and it's really not

01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:54.960
adding value to anything I don't think I'm sure I'm wrong but I mean you could

01:21:54.960 --> 01:21:58.840
be like a building a bridge is it supposed to be I've seen it like

01:21:58.840 --> 01:22:02.800
flipping through the yeah that yeah that you know your TV channel guide thing

01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:05.720
I've never watched it is it supposed to be I'm just realizing now is it supposed

01:22:05.720 --> 01:22:10.800
to be a play I come porn stars yep yeah dumb dumb oh dumb that I didn't get that

01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:16.360
but still dumb yeah that's a bold stance yeah porn stars porn is the only on

01:22:16.360 --> 01:22:19.840
industry I think where every single performer is a star right when you

01:22:19.840 --> 01:22:29.680
start right that's nice nice check off stars well I mean what about amateurs

01:22:29.680 --> 01:22:35.560
right aren't they still just amateur porn stars yeah they're amateur porn

01:22:35.560 --> 01:22:41.320
start they're on the pro am sure yeah you're either not a nothing or you do

01:22:41.320 --> 01:22:45.680
one porn and then you're a porn star it's right some famous old actor like

01:22:45.680 --> 01:22:49.320
Clint Eastwood or someone like that is like I'm porn star I said I go I there's

01:22:49.320 --> 01:22:53.920

extras that's just not a joke not being funny yeah but you but you said it with

01:23:09.960 --> 01:23:17.040
an ominousness that that freaked me out the truth can be ominous there are no

01:23:17.040 --> 01:23:29.320
small parts in porn definitely no small parts the there was a producer I talked

01:23:29.320 --> 01:23:34.000
to what she was who's he can't really mad at one point when I've on this rant

01:27:48.160 --> 01:27:52.640
trickling over polished stone that's what it what does it mean does that mean

01:27:52.640 --> 01:27:57.920
that it really actually doesn't mean water over polished loosely translates to

01:27:57.920 --> 01:28:03.120
stubborn arts my biggest one there is no translation for stuff it's like shot

01:28:03.120 --> 01:28:07.600
in Freud this was this character sheets for Matt thank you Camel one of my

01:28:07.600 --> 01:28:10.920
deep regrets in life is that I've tried because I once in a while what if I'm

01:28:10.920 --> 01:28:14.360
telling a story that involves somebody I'll try to do it like a mild impression

01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:17.680
of them not to like mock them or because I'm so good at impressions but you just

01:28:17.680 --> 01:28:20.480
try to kind of do the voice I wish I could do your voice because your voice

01:28:20.480 --> 01:28:23.240
is delightful I can't I can't get anywhere close and when I kind of come

01:28:23.240 --> 01:28:28.080
close I'm doing it way wrong and it's offensive it's not offensive I just

01:28:28.080 --> 01:28:30.920
can't get though there's there's the lilts of the voice that I can't quite do

01:28:30.920 --> 01:28:34.240
like give me something to say to practice like give me a give me a like a

01:28:34.240 --> 01:28:37.520

01:28:49.320 --> 01:28:59.840
little bit like like Punjab buddy go for it's not willful I could talk like that

01:28:59.840 --> 01:29:07.080
I'd never stop all right Spencer yeah start talking oh last time on Harmon

01:29:07.080 --> 01:29:12.360
town the party was in dire straits chained by their very souls and in the

01:29:12.360 --> 01:29:17.600
clutches of undead bureaucrats after the bone sages of tourma tour enacted the

01:29:17.600 --> 01:29:22.560
mysterious rites of tell him Varna they began the proceedings by shouting and

01:29:22.560 --> 01:29:26.880
asking for the guilty party to reveal themselves immediately Mulraine Sedona

01:29:26.880 --> 01:29:31.640
suffering from a rash of poor life decisions came forward confusing and

01:29:31.640 --> 01:29:36.360
bewildering all quarks struggled against his chains and managed to sever his

01:29:36.360 --> 01:29:41.960
ties but that only began a countdown to the total eradication of his very soul

01:29:41.960 --> 01:29:47.920
I keep saying very souls in this thing cap with their very souls captive in

01:29:47.920 --> 01:29:53.480
their muscle on a death timer how would they escape the rights of tell him Varna

01:29:53.480 --> 01:30:01.000
and their own collective death which which death collective death wish find

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:11.280
out blah blah on the next blah blah yeah so you guys hungry I could really go

01:30:11.280 --> 01:30:16.720

01:30:33.440 --> 01:30:40.600
gas on accident no but was it somebody else hexed him or he is trying to get

01:30:40.600 --> 01:30:44.160
out of his and I had these these soul chains that go into your our bodies I

01:30:44.160 --> 01:30:47.640
ripped it out and I felt like my soul was leaving so I put him back in and then

01:30:47.640 --> 01:30:50.600
I tried to sever the thing and then they're kind of just retreating into my

01:30:50.600 --> 01:30:54.280
body like a fuse and I've got about 10 minutes or so before something probably

01:30:54.280 --> 01:30:58.680
life-ending happens what's Christopher DeBurke doing now you're also chained by

01:30:58.680 --> 01:31:05.800

Lenev and now things are bad so wait he said if you you you thought he said if

01:33:21.680 --> 01:33:26.520
you cross the line he's gonna end you and so you decided to cross the line

01:33:26.520 --> 01:33:32.280
preemptively in self-defense we'll handle this what right does any being

01:33:32.280 --> 01:33:35.640
have to draw those kinds of we leave that fucking discussion I've got ten

01:33:35.640 --> 01:33:38.960
minutes to live we've been through that well this could be the crux of his case

01:33:38.960 --> 01:33:41.560
that's why we're here that's what do you think Lenev is gonna be talking about

01:33:41.560 --> 01:33:44.760
out there it's not a big misunderstanding we didn't mean to kill the whole

01:33:44.760 --> 01:33:50.120
village also we several overtures several friendly overtures as he got mad

01:33:50.120 --> 01:33:54.800
time and time again we extended friendliness to him he took us back to

01:33:54.800 --> 01:34:00.560
this place and and after it was clearly established that we were friendly he then

01:34:00.560 --> 01:34:04.880
announced that we were bad people and that's why we're soul shackled because

01:34:04.880 --> 01:34:07.480
believe me I wouldn't be here do you know anything about Larry do you know

01:34:07.480 --> 01:34:11.400
anything about the rights of tell them Verna that's that's what I did my thesis

01:34:11.400 --> 01:34:19.560
on now I don't want to worry you this is my first case I was a boat repairman for

01:34:19.560 --> 01:34:26.280
I don't know 20 years and I did law as a hobby I'm a hobbyist lawyer but what

01:34:26.280 --> 01:34:32.320
go team we're gonna do your day job your day but day job is still repairing both

01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:38.560
well I don't get paid for it anymore I was fired why it my boats would sink

01:34:38.560 --> 01:34:41.160
well don't think this boat

01:34:41.160 --> 01:34:47.160
wouldn't have recesses over recesses over oh recesses over say the three bone

01:34:47.160 --> 01:34:56.120
stages one at a time we shall proceed now special persecutor speak Lenev

01:34:56.120 --> 01:34:59.120
whenever I'm thinking here but every time you say persecutors and a prosecutor

01:34:59.120 --> 01:35:03.960
Adam Goldberg corrects you from the audience yeah it's like an old like a

01:35:03.960 --> 01:35:08.960
cartoon when I was a kid gag I'd give credit if I knew what it was anyway I

01:35:08.960 --> 01:35:12.520
just wanted to point it out so it doesn't happen all night

01:35:12.520 --> 01:35:18.680
Lenev he addresses this this circle of hooded figures kind of standing around

01:35:18.680 --> 01:35:23.680
you guys he says gentlemen you'd no doubt remember how we all came together to

01:35:23.680 --> 01:35:28.520
stave off the dark admirals demonic sorcerers as well as how you rallied

01:35:28.520 --> 01:35:33.520
with me to break the siege of the frost giants and their necromantic king today

01:35:33.520 --> 01:35:37.880
we face a similar challenge in recovering from the artisan disaster I

01:35:37.880 --> 01:35:42.360
scarcely need to mention the hundred of lost lives but despite those most

01:35:42.360 --> 01:35:47.680
giving of rib who devoted eternity to staving off the inevitable decay I tell

01:35:47.680 --> 01:35:52.920
you we will rally again and we will carry on but not if we allow these maniacs to

01:35:52.920 --> 01:35:58.240
continue their rampage you stand before the four culprits of the destruction of

01:35:58.240 --> 01:36:03.000
the artisans annex and the murder of our most valued craftsmen and we will have

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:07.360
vengeance the ring of hooded bodies hisses and stamps their feet bones

01:36:07.360 --> 01:36:11.320
rattling in rage okay I huddle with the guys who are the artisans that we killed

01:36:11.320 --> 01:36:17.160
yeah this is your first case yeah I mean I've done some model United Nations

01:36:17.160 --> 01:36:22.800
before but it's all right can we remind these people that we did everything we

01:36:22.800 --> 01:36:26.800
but we killed Admiral Darkstar we were responsible for everything good that's

01:36:26.800 --> 01:36:30.280
happened in this region and it was his palace that fell down on all the artisans

01:36:30.280 --> 01:36:34.840
over the cross examination we've got this we've got this no that's not how

01:36:34.840 --> 01:36:41.840

01:37:29.400 --> 01:37:34.000

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:38.000
much you've been great lie down okay thank you welcome I'd like to call to the

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:45.200
stand Sharpie yes Sharpie are you in fact a corporeal body right now no I'm

01:37:45.200 --> 01:37:50.920
made of gas at the present time would you say you're a big ball of gas I mean

01:37:50.920 --> 01:37:57.960
I a lot of hot air why blustery wind that wouldn't mean anything sincerely you're

01:37:57.960 --> 01:38:04.160
joking your chesting a lot yeah but I'm not always this way but but but you are

01:38:04.160 --> 01:38:10.120
now right you have been in the recent past yes so it would be difficult for

01:38:10.120 --> 01:38:13.840
someone to take say a comment or a threat seriously and if they did that

01:38:13.840 --> 01:38:17.760
might be on them yeah well if you're I mean I just turned to gas like five

01:38:17.760 --> 01:38:27.480
minutes okay sidebar sidebar okay he's trying to help you yeah but I mean I

01:38:27.480 --> 01:38:31.960
can't I mean they weren't gonna buy that yeah but he was taking the I like when

01:38:31.960 --> 01:38:34.600
he was going with that I was taking the physical form and he was making a

01:38:34.600 --> 01:38:40.400
bigger metaphorical point yeah I will continue though you are now physically a

01:38:40.400 --> 01:38:44.280
ball of gas and you weren't at the time is it not true that when you go through

01:38:44.280 --> 01:38:47.640
some sort of transformation you get like when you're drunk you become your true

01:38:47.640 --> 01:38:52.080
self you you have now turned into what essentially your essences and that's a

01:38:52.080 --> 01:38:57.640
wag a gesture just someone who who has a good laugh I am an alcoholic and I have

01:38:57.640 --> 01:39:06.120
a problem with authority if that's what you're asking do they all do they all

01:39:06.120 --> 01:39:14.040
have to be sentenced individually as a whole can we can we cast one aside

01:39:14.040 --> 01:39:21.360
throw one to the dogs I was asking the judge yes okay good all right Chris I

01:39:21.360 --> 01:39:27.640
call to the stand Chris de Burgh hey Chris what the fuck is going on okay

01:39:27.640 --> 01:39:33.120
here's what happened yeah I don't know these guys that well I like this I like

01:39:33.120 --> 01:39:38.840
and and I have literally been fighting them for the last few hours I asked them

01:39:38.840 --> 01:39:44.720
I've been vomiting on their faces because you're possessed by laser eyes at them

01:39:44.720 --> 01:39:49.320
in an effort to get them to stop killing all the artisans that they've been

01:39:49.320 --> 01:40:03.240
talking how did the castle fall down isn't there a castle yeah we we killed

01:40:03.240 --> 01:40:08.800
Admiral Darkstar because he because he had it coming yes oh yeah everybody

01:40:08.800 --> 01:40:15.040
agrees with that your honor he did great service for land oh yeah we wouldn't

01:40:15.040 --> 01:40:18.200
even be having this conversation because we will be dead he'd still be alive we

01:40:18.200 --> 01:40:21.880
don't be on the run from Admiral Darkstar instead we destroyed dead if not dead

01:40:21.880 --> 01:40:26.000
already yeah instead of everybody being dead we just killed all the artisans let

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:33.120
me rephrase that instead of everyone being dead because of the good we did all

01:40:33.120 --> 01:40:42.800
the artisans are dead your honor there's a term in warfare and government's called

01:40:42.800 --> 01:40:46.760
collateral damage that the needs of the many are greater than the needs of the

01:40:46.760 --> 01:40:50.200
few and I think that's what we have here and if you fail to appreciate that you

01:40:50.200 --> 01:40:54.600
might as well your your your justice in your malls might be as dead as you would

01:40:54.600 --> 01:40:58.280
be if Darkstar was alive I think he is alive I think he's possessed

01:40:58.280 --> 01:41:02.320
Chris de Burgh I think that's why he's being an asshole we never saw him die

01:41:02.320 --> 01:41:05.840
we killed him and then a giant robot and we ripped his head off there was gas

01:41:05.840 --> 01:41:10.640
everywhere I don't know what the fuck and then I think Admiral Darkstar is

01:41:10.640 --> 01:41:13.960
still alive and I certainly know he's alive in the hearts of all you assholes

01:41:13.960 --> 01:41:17.840
if you continue to be dicks to us because because that's what Admiral

01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:23.080
Darkstar wants he wants us fighting each other I hate everyone okay I'm still

01:41:23.080 --> 01:41:28.480
on the stand can I say I am not possessed by Admiral Darkstar but maybe he

01:41:28.480 --> 01:41:35.160
wasn't such a bad guy right all right all right all right all right all right

01:41:35.160 --> 01:41:45.360
maybe he had some good points now your honor your honor no yes what huh there's

01:41:45.360 --> 01:41:56.040
three of them your honors it's yours honor yours honor all right I'm I'm

01:41:56.040 --> 01:42:02.840
going to invoke a little-known car to sell of the legal book called the Kansas

01:42:02.840 --> 01:42:10.720
Clause where the house falls on a witch it's not the house owner or occupant or

01:42:10.720 --> 01:42:16.680
visitor's fault they were merely going about that day they did they did can you

01:42:16.680 --> 01:42:21.360
prove any intent to kill at at at worst this is involuntary manslaughter not

01:42:21.360 --> 01:42:29.080
artisan murder but put that out of you you try out of brains and look at these

01:42:29.080 --> 01:42:35.240
faces first let's start over there look at that face yeah look at that look at

01:42:35.240 --> 01:42:41.080
that salt and pepper beard the sweet disposition the very fear of having

01:42:41.080 --> 01:42:46.240
blood drawn same face by the way that spit in your beloved frost giants eyes

01:42:46.240 --> 01:42:57.200
so all right you know all right you love them so much shut your prison hole let's

01:42:57.200 --> 01:43:07.960
take a look at Christopher look at that face let me tell you something I went to

01:43:07.960 --> 01:43:13.040
college with a man who had killed artisans he was a big brawling man he

01:43:13.040 --> 01:43:17.480
had studs he had pink in his hair he was a punk rocker that was an artisan killer

01:43:17.480 --> 01:43:23.160
look at that listen to him speak say the word I can't I can't even do it I can't

01:43:23.160 --> 01:43:30.800
even do it I can't dance it's so sweet now we have we have a limited time over

01:43:30.800 --> 01:43:38.360
here am I stone a barbarian rager now no please no okay he's weak he's fragile

01:43:38.360 --> 01:43:44.640
he's sickly he's I don't want to die he's you're not gonna want to die Larry do

01:43:44.640 --> 01:43:50.520
you want to do this to him look at this face now there are three of you there

01:43:50.520 --> 01:43:55.880
are three of them and what I ask you is that if if all of you are going to find

01:43:55.880 --> 01:43:59.800
them guilty you have to find all three of them guilty but all three of you must

01:43:59.800 --> 01:44:04.400
find one innocent little lamb among these three and if there's one certainly

01:44:04.400 --> 01:44:07.280
there could be three

01:44:08.160 --> 01:44:14.840
don't kill them let them live and I will tell you this if you let them go they

01:44:14.840 --> 01:44:23.240
will bring you back the head of the of the marsh minotaur

01:44:23.240 --> 01:44:32.720
hello go with me who I know is the scourge of the Jesus Christ there's our

01:44:32.720 --> 01:44:42.760
next one though yes he's the scourge of the of the flea market Hills he's been

01:44:42.760 --> 01:44:47.400
going in there every Sunday when they have their little farmers market and

01:44:47.400 --> 01:44:51.640
taking the goat cheeses and the artisan breads and he's taking them for

01:44:51.640 --> 01:44:56.280
themselves the poor peasants they they they need to be rid of him if you see in

01:44:56.280 --> 01:44:59.840
your heart to let these three go they will bring you the head of the marsh

01:44:59.840 --> 01:45:05.600
minotaur absolutely might guarantee and then if they don't lock them up and

01:45:05.600 --> 01:45:10.640
throw away the key send them into the pits of skull door send them into the

01:45:10.640 --> 01:45:16.880
sex caverns of Jambi died send them to the dungeons of Stubnortz for all I

01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:19.120
care

01:45:19.240 --> 01:45:25.280
but these people are not guilty I rough I rest my case no further questions

01:45:25.280 --> 01:45:35.960
Attica Attica you are out of order so the bone sages they deliberate they

01:45:35.960 --> 01:45:39.920
deliberate they the grumble and groan and talk to each other for a while and

01:45:39.920 --> 01:45:44.760
they're like that guy in his fucking goat cheeses he has been a thorn in our

01:45:44.760 --> 01:45:51.480
side well you guys have made really good points I'm actually quite astonished

01:45:51.480 --> 01:45:57.200
you came up with possessions and all sorts of reasons why they might not

01:45:57.200 --> 01:46:01.720
totally have been in their right minds and it seems like did you mention that

01:46:01.720 --> 01:46:06.800
they killed Admiral Darkstar you serious about that yeah as a great service to the

01:46:06.800 --> 01:46:13.120
land even you couldn't do that Lenev is a pussy willow he's been titty bitched

01:46:13.120 --> 01:46:18.960
and he can go screw I gotta admit when he came in here hissing and yelling I

01:46:18.960 --> 01:46:23.240
was I was pretty perturbed by that whole thing yeah he's a little bit of a fuck

01:46:23.240 --> 01:46:27.040
face I was surprised when he brought us in it was it was it was it was actually

01:46:27.040 --> 01:46:33.400
impressed that he belonged to you as a people and it didn't it didn't mesh I

01:46:33.400 --> 01:46:36.760
mean he's a still a great warrior and a hero to our how do we know that it wasn't

01:46:36.760 --> 01:46:44.720
Lenev that killed the artisans and is trying to pin it on us we don't well

01:46:44.720 --> 01:46:49.400
then that that that settles it uh bring out the beast of burden and tell him

01:46:49.400 --> 01:47:03.280
Varna shall finish what tell him something resembling a a large maybe

01:47:03.280 --> 01:47:09.520
like a like a cow sized fleshy six-legged a pillbug like a pillbug but

01:47:09.520 --> 01:47:18.360
fleshy fleshy trundles into the church in tech yeah but like a roly-poly that's

01:47:18.360 --> 01:47:23.560
a skin tag that's what's happening trundles into the church and kind of

01:47:23.560 --> 01:47:28.440
stands in front of you guys before you see his head kind of head flesh it peels

01:47:28.440 --> 01:47:36.760
back and reveals a strange skull and the skull gives a screech and then

01:47:36.760 --> 01:47:42.560
shatters and it falls dead look tell him Varna is over there's the shackles

01:47:42.560 --> 01:47:49.840
vanish Jesus I thought that was gonna go a different direction I think I think in

01:47:49.840 --> 01:47:54.480
