00:00.000 --> 00:18.000
Phoenix, Arizona. Stand up live. How are you guys doing tonight?

00:18.000 --> 00:27.000
Well I have some bloody good news for you. Harmontown is in session in Arizona.

00:27.000 --> 00:36.000
Won't you please help me in welcoming the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.

00:36.000 --> 00:45.000
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo Phoenix, yo Phoenix, yo Phoenix, yo Phoenix. Best city in the goddamn world.

00:45.000 --> 00:52.000
What's in his ear? What's in his ear? There's a weird thing in my ear. Don't be distracted.

00:52.000 --> 01:02.000
It's a camera. I'm looking at you. I'm taping for you for your movie. You're gonna be in my movie.

01:02.000 --> 01:15.000
Mind games being played with you. Thought you were watching me. I'm watching you making movies about an audience.

01:15.000 --> 01:29.000
Phoenix. We have so much to talk about and barely any time to do it. Thank you for waiting if you were waiting.

01:29.000 --> 01:39.000
I heard you broke the ice with, he told you, it's just your ponytail. We wanted to know who you were so bad.

01:39.000 --> 01:48.000
What's your name? Ham? You're happy? You're happy to be here? Okay. If you said no, it would take us down a whole different road.

01:48.000 --> 01:53.000
In the future, if you guys are regular here and you come to the show again and you sit in that seat,

01:53.000 --> 01:59.000
just know that the people backstage get to look at the side of your head for the entire, just one, really one share.

01:59.000 --> 02:04.000
Like the top of your head, just like the top third of your head, depending on your confidence.

02:04.000 --> 02:09.000
Every time you get a little happy, you're like whack-a-mole.

02:09.000 --> 02:15.000
We could see his, with the top of his hat right there, we couldn't tell if he was a ninja because all we could see was the back of the hat.

02:15.000 --> 02:23.000
My back was dreadlocks. I thought there'd be dreadlocks under there, but it's not. You're clearly just a regular non-Jamaican meth dealer.

02:23.000 --> 02:29.000
Just a surfer type, right? You guys are probably sick of meth jokes. I'm sure everybody that comes through goes like,

02:29.000 --> 02:35.000
hey, it's a meth. I'm from Wisconsin. It was cheese. You guys make meth.

02:35.000 --> 02:42.000
What do you wear on top of your heads at the football games? Like a glass?

02:42.000 --> 02:48.000
Now I'm doing it. Now I'm doing it. I'm doing what everyone does when they come through here, I'm sure.

02:48.000 --> 02:53.000
It's the Southwest. It's the best region of the country.

02:53.000 --> 02:59.000
It's Phoenix. It's the greatest. It's the sixth largest capital city in the United States.

02:59.000 --> 03:05.000
Your mayor's name is Greg Stanton.

03:05.000 --> 03:09.000
Your football team is the Sun Sanders.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
Fuck.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
Spent all day in the hotel room.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
The Sun Sanders.

03:15.000 --> 03:20.000
You love cacti. You're proud of it.

03:20.000 --> 03:26.000
So much to talk about. So we're making the movie. That's why I came out with the Bluetooth.

03:26.000 --> 03:32.000
We just went everywhere we go. We're making this. We got in the tour bus. You're our first stop, by the way.

03:32.000 --> 03:38.000
I talked to people at the bar. They didn't even know that. I make the mistake.

03:38.000 --> 03:42.000
I think that's a narcissist mistake. You think that everyone knows what you know.

03:42.000 --> 03:47.000
So first of all, that adds to nervousness. I think you know that I'm an asshole. I think you know I'm stupid.

03:47.000 --> 03:52.000
I think you know I'm not funny. And I also think you know that this is our first stop on the tour.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
But obviously, we have to get to know each other.

03:55.000 --> 04:00.000
We have been doing this show in a cradle in Los Angeles. It's a very specific audience.

04:00.000 --> 04:06.000
You guys are a specific audience. We have to spend tonight making a kind of love.

04:06.000 --> 04:13.000
It will be consensual. We're going to leave here with your money having been well spent.

04:13.000 --> 04:22.000
Or I will literally kill myself on stage. And you can Instagram it and use the right filter.

04:22.000 --> 04:27.000
Because I think I feel like my blood looks fat this week.

04:27.000 --> 04:33.000
Also, for those of you that listen to the podcast, I don't know if you've listened to the last one,

04:33.000 --> 04:38.000
but Pat and Oswald gave Phoenix some pretty rough treatments.

04:38.000 --> 04:45.000
Did anyone hear that? We'll start to get to know each other.

04:45.000 --> 04:53.000
Who listens to the podcast regularly?

04:53.000 --> 04:57.000
That's like 60% there.

04:57.000 --> 05:04.000
Who just got a flyer saying, you won a comedy contest. Come see some funny stand-up.

05:04.000 --> 05:10.000
Okay, thank God. That was my big nightmare. It was like, hey, let's go see some comedy.

05:10.000 --> 05:18.000
And then I come out and I'm like, I feel fat. This isn't Horatio Sands.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
Who's fat?

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
Well, he's lost a lot of weight. He looks good.

05:23.000 --> 05:30.000
I'm just saying, these posters on the wall, the people here tonight who came for that,

05:30.000 --> 05:35.000
you're also going to get your money's worth. I swear to God. I swear to your God.

05:35.000 --> 05:41.000
I'm not even mine. Mine's more easy going than yours. I will do whatever your God requires.

05:41.000 --> 05:48.000
You're not leaving here until your money has been well spent. How much were the tickets?

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
Twenty-two.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
Okay, I take it back.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
That's rough.

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
That's a tall order for a guy like me.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
Twenty-two. That's an arbitrarily non-round number.

05:59.000 --> 06:04.000
I've never done a $22 show. This will be my first one.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
Okay, fine.

06:05.000 --> 06:09.000
Tonight, Dan, let's give him a $23 show.

06:09.000 --> 06:14.000
This will help the $20. I was like pandering to your...

06:14.000 --> 06:18.000
What Dan is doing for the podcast is he's taking off, he's unbuttoning his shirt.

06:18.000 --> 06:28.000
It's not an Arizona state shirt. It's the Alice Cooper, Cooper's town, knockoff of the Sun Devil's shirt.

06:28.000 --> 06:35.000
So we have Wildcat fans who are also like big Ted Nugent fans as well.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
Wait, are you guys mad at Sun Devil's or Alice Cooper?

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
Both.

06:40.000 --> 06:47.000
But what about... Didn't you just tell me that Ted Nugent compared gun owners to Rosa Parks today?

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
Yeah, I just read that.

06:49.000 --> 06:53.000
Ted Nugent made the brave, odd choice.

06:53.000 --> 06:59.000
He said... I just saw it like in a little blurb. Apparently he said that gun owners compared them to Rosa Parks

06:59.000 --> 07:05.000
and that one day the law-abiding gun owner will be sitting in the front of the bus.

07:05.000 --> 07:09.000
Whatever that bus is. I'm assuming it's a bus to go rob a bank.

07:09.000 --> 07:14.000
Sounds like the bus is shooting people. I don't know how that metaphor is supposed to be explored.

07:14.000 --> 07:22.000
We're sitting in the back of it now, which means we're not shooting people with the guns that we're heroes for having.

07:22.000 --> 07:28.000
I don't turn to Ted Nugent for my metaphors. I don't think of him as somebody...

07:28.000 --> 07:32.000
I don't know why we've begun turning to him for our politics. It's the weirdest.

07:32.000 --> 07:36.000
I trust him for one topic alone, bow hunting. That's it.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
Bow hunting?

07:37.000 --> 07:45.000
Ted Nugent knows everything about bow hunting. If he came up here and was like, this is how you notch an arrow, I believe you.

07:45.000 --> 07:53.000
I would go to him not for civil rights analogies. I would go to him more if I had questions about Wang Dang, Sweet Poon Tang.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
That's when I would turn to Ted Nugent.

07:56.000 --> 08:01.000
Holy shit! What a great city! Phoenix is amazing!

08:01.000 --> 08:07.000
You're already starting to sense that I'm forcing that.

08:07.000 --> 08:12.000
I would say I really mean it, but I can't yet.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
You were nervous about tonight?

08:13.000 --> 08:19.000
Well, yeah, because we left our comfort zone. We drove in a bus and then we came out the door and we came in here.

08:19.000 --> 08:29.000
And I saw the lacquered tables and the three-foot high stage and the posters of people who clearly you can tell from the photos on the wall,

08:29.000 --> 08:34.000
the people who normally perform here, they have actual material.

08:34.000 --> 08:39.000
They're doing it in the picture. There's a picture of a lady going like, ah!

08:39.000 --> 08:46.000
She's in the middle, she's just finishing explaining what Jack Nicholson would be like in a drive-thru.

08:46.000 --> 08:55.000
That guy just finally drew the line between men and women in the shopping with the toilet.

08:55.000 --> 09:00.000
This is like a hall of fame back there.

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
See, most comics come up and riff the sets.

09:03.000 --> 09:09.000
A hat comic would come up and go, oh, wow, nice to be back in Preskets.

09:09.000 --> 09:13.000
But you're actually riffing the other comics that are on the wall here.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
You're riffing on comics.

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
I'm not riffing. I'm intimidated by them. They look like the...

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
I can't tell anyone. Is that Gallagher or a woman? I can't see who that is.

09:20.000 --> 09:24.000
It looks like Rachel Dratch or like an emo...

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
Oh, it's Bobby Lee.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
That's Bobby Lee.

09:28.000 --> 09:32.000
Bobby Lee, if you're listening, I thought you were Rachel Dratch.

09:32.000 --> 09:36.000
And Bobby Lee, I thought you were Gallagher, so...

09:36.000 --> 09:41.000
And everyone else on the wall here, take it easy on the appetizers.

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
That's mean. Look at me. Look at me.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
There is a thing... I was looking through the menu.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
There's a thing on the menu that just says pig.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
And it boasts that it's...

09:52.000 --> 09:56.000
Somebody grab a menu and read the pig for me on the microphone.

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
Is there a menu out there?

09:59.000 --> 10:03.000
A half pound of bacon with a side of maple syrup.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
That's fucking fantastic.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
He said a pound.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
It's a half pound.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
Take it easy.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
What do you think this is? Ladies' night?

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
I don't know what that means.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
Are you saying women are pigs, Dan? Is that what that was?

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
I don't know what it means.

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
I will say things. I don't know what they mean.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
I just hope it makes you laugh.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
It's a trick people can perform.

10:26.000 --> 10:31.000
It's kind of like a Rubik's Cube and a Monica Lewinsky cigar.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
No, it didn't work. Okay, good.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
Don't ever let me fool you.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
Rap! Rap!

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
Oh, shit. You want to rap?

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
See, now Dan... I don't know if you guys are familiar with this.

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
Dan likes to rap.

10:45.000 --> 10:50.000
The raps usually involve him fucking one of your mothers.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
We have a...

10:51.000 --> 10:55.000
Who wants me to rap about fucking their mom?

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
All right, I've got a lot of hands. I love Phoenix.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
You're on?

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
Wait, this guy wants you to fuck his aunt.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
Fuck his house?

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
His aunt.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
All right, all right.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
You want Dan Harmon to rap about fucking your aunt?

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
One of those.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
All right.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
All right. Well, shit, I'm torn.

11:14.000 --> 11:18.000
Now, Dan, we have a lot of different rap styles here we can use here.

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
We have sexy and slow freestyle.

11:21.000 --> 11:26.000
I want to do a sexy, slow rap about fucking his aunt.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
Who is a sister of his mama?

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
Maybe you can tie that in.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
You're already burning up my rhyme.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
Sorry.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
Wait, what's your name, sir?

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
Alex?

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
Okay, what's your aunt's name?

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
Patty?

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
And what is she the most afraid of?

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
Aging?

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
How old is she?

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
I forgot her name already.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
Patty.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
I'm not good at this.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
I'm not good at this.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
I'm good at fucking your mama.

11:55.000 --> 12:01.000
I fuck, oh, shit.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
Sorry.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
Maybe that's how you met his aunt.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
Right.

12:06.000 --> 12:11.000
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
Alex came over, wanted to talk to me.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
I said, can I fuck your mama?

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
He said, let's wait and see.

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
He brought me down the hall into a different room.

12:20.000 --> 12:25.000
He said, the pussy you're going to fuck is not connected to womb.

12:25.000 --> 12:30.000
Yes, it is, but not the one that gave birth to me.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
He introduced me to a different person.

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
I was, my eyes were bursting.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
I took this bitch in.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
I said, who are you?

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
She said, my name is Patty and I want to fuck you.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
I said, oh, shit.

12:44.000 --> 12:49.000
Alex's aunt, I want to fuck her out of her pant.

12:49.000 --> 12:52.000
She had one pant, not a pair.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
I fucked his aunt.

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
You didn't care, but check it out.

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
I turned her over and said, holy shit.

13:00.000 --> 13:04.000
Phoenix is a great city.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
It's hard.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
I can't, I can't fucking ant.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
It's hard.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
It's too hard.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
Do you want to fuck somebody's mama instead?

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
Yeah, let's fuck this guy's mama.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
All right.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
What's your name, sir?

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
Dustin.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
Dustin?

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
You would like Dan Harmon to fuck your mama right now.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
Okay, what's your favorite food?

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
Steak.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
Okay, steak.

13:24.000 --> 13:27.000
All right.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
Which movie did you think was better?

13:29.000 --> 13:33.000
Tremors or Shawshank Redemption?

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
Shawshank Redemption.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
Okay, he likes steak.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
What was his name?

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
Dustin.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
Dustin.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
Dustin.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
Okay.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
All right, Dustin.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
This is Shawshank Redemption and steak.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
And I fucked his mama.

13:44.000 --> 13:48.000
Give me a beat.

13:48.000 --> 13:54.000
Ladies and gentlemen, Dustin's mama has been fucked

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
at least once that we know of.

13:57.000 --> 14:06.000
But she's about to get it again.

14:06.000 --> 14:14.000
Oh, I'm everywhere.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
Breakdown.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
Four in the afternoon.

14:16.000 --> 14:22.000
Fuck Dustin's mama all the way into...

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
The moon.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
Retake.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
Retake.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
That was my fault.

14:27.000 --> 14:30.000
I meant to give you this one.

14:30.000 --> 14:35.000
All right, this one's...

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
Yeah.

14:36.000 --> 14:44.000
And what if I fucked Dustin's mama tonight?

14:44.000 --> 14:50.000
Dustin's mama, does he taste like steak?

14:50.000 --> 14:58.000
It's ironic, because her son loves it, and so do I.

14:58.000 --> 15:04.000
The weird thing is, if I was next to him, which I would never want to be very uncomfortable,

15:04.000 --> 15:11.000
given the naked company, I'd look over to him and say, this is steak.

15:11.000 --> 15:15.000
And he'd say, that's my favorite food.

15:15.000 --> 15:19.000
But you're talking about my mama's pussy.

15:19.000 --> 15:28.000
At that point, it'd sink in what I'd done, and I'd be like, sorry, so sorry.

15:28.000 --> 15:33.000
I've gone too far, Dustin.

15:33.000 --> 15:36.000
Let's go watch Shawshank Redemption.

15:36.000 --> 15:41.000
I thought it was pretty masterful how I used suggestions to create a...

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
Yeah, yeah.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
You didn't know how those were going to come in.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
That was experimental.

15:45.000 --> 15:49.000
All right, let's stop with the gimmicks.

15:49.000 --> 15:53.000
What am I performing monkey?

15:53.000 --> 15:56.000
What am I someone you paid $22 to see?

15:56.000 --> 15:59.000
We have to get a couple things out of the way just for the movie.

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
I'll take it off of your $22 if you see me after you go.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
I helped you with the movie.

16:04.000 --> 16:08.000
I want my $3 because we've got to get a couple of...

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
Because we're making this movie, it's like a tour movie.

16:11.000 --> 16:21.000
One thing I can think that we definitely need is the slow-motion montage of me killing it at every venue.

16:21.000 --> 16:27.000
We definitely have to fake that because it's not going to happen.

16:27.000 --> 16:33.000
Because I don't have Bobby Lee's chutzpah.

16:33.000 --> 16:37.000
The horrible song about Dustin's mom, I'm so sorry.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
I don't know what I thought I was doing.

16:39.000 --> 16:43.000
It didn't rhyme and it was gross and it evoked an image of...

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
This is gross.

16:45.000 --> 16:48.000
I lost a lot of the women too and I'm sorry.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
You want to try a country song instead?

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
Maybe in a second.

16:52.000 --> 16:56.000
We don't want to burn up all the gold.

16:56.000 --> 17:00.000
We're safe so far.

17:00.000 --> 17:03.000
Let's just get a quick...

17:03.000 --> 17:06.000
I just want to get a shot of...

17:06.000 --> 17:11.000
It's slow-motion so I don't know if there's cameras that can overcrank.

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
I need you guys to be slow-mo.

17:14.000 --> 17:18.000
If you can just imagine that I did well.

17:18.000 --> 17:21.000
This sounds like the most dishonest thing in the world.

17:21.000 --> 17:26.000
Dan, Harmontown is about being sincere and honest connections with people.

17:26.000 --> 17:29.000
It's basically a real thing.

17:29.000 --> 17:32.000
Just imagine that it's the end of the show.

17:32.000 --> 17:37.000
I did really good and kind of like slow-mo reach for me.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
You wish you could touch me.

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
And then I'll be kind of like touching you.

17:42.000 --> 17:46.000
But first I want to get the Bon Jovi Sweep.

17:46.000 --> 17:51.000
So you guys can just kind of raise up like one, two, three, do it.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
Like slow-mo.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
Wait, wait, wait.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
This is all a lie.

18:05.000 --> 18:16.000
What kind of movie do you think you're making?

18:16.000 --> 18:19.000
Movie of lies.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
I won't sign off on this, Dan.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
This is the...

18:26.000 --> 18:29.000
Alright, well, whatever.

18:29.000 --> 18:32.000
Alright, well, can we also...

18:32.000 --> 18:36.000
Well, give yourselves a hand.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
Well, can we...

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
We'll counteract it then.

18:40.000 --> 18:44.000
I say now, Dan, now because of that dishonesty,

18:44.000 --> 18:49.000
now it's your... the onus is on you to create that moment for real by the end of this show.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
I will definitely will.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
I basically already did.

18:53.000 --> 18:56.000
With community.

18:56.000 --> 19:01.000
See?

19:01.000 --> 19:06.000
But when I don't have Joel McHale again on camera,

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
I have to juice it a little bit.

19:08.000 --> 19:11.000
There's everything, everything in entertainment is a lie.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
Okay, well, here, I'll do you this favor.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
Let's do the opposite.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
Like let's do the dark moment.

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
We don't know, this might be the worst gig of the whole tour.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
So does anybody have...

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
Do you have stuff you could throw at me?

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
Without hurting me?

19:26.000 --> 19:30.000
A lot of people are very readily picked up bottles.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
But nothing glass, nothing...

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
Yeah, plastic.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
Okay, that was...

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
That looked like a roll of like sweet tarts.

19:37.000 --> 19:40.000
Well, don't, don't, don't wait, don't start.

19:40.000 --> 19:43.000
There has to be control.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
You can't just...

19:45.000 --> 19:49.000
Like, like, like I cue you and then we go because we have to get a good shot.

19:49.000 --> 19:52.000
So, alright, so just...

19:52.000 --> 19:55.000
Okay, so I'm going to cower because I kind of like...

19:55.000 --> 19:59.000
I reached too hard and you turned on me.

19:59.000 --> 20:02.000
And just kind of like, just kind of boomy.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
And if you don't have anything to throw,

20:04.000 --> 20:11.000
just kind of like point angrily or go like this, like forget this.

20:11.000 --> 20:15.000
So, alright, so I'll just cue you with like a generic thing.

20:15.000 --> 20:20.000
So you'll receive the cue, I'll cue you naturally.

20:20.000 --> 20:23.000
Like, this has been the greatest chewer ever.

20:23.000 --> 20:27.000
This thing's been better than 9-11, which I loved happening.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
I loved it.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
I loved it.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
What are you talking about, you dumb shit?

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
No!

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
You don't know what you're talking about!

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
Fuck you!

20:36.000 --> 20:39.000
I'm going back to Los Angeles!

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
You're such a bitch!

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
Alright, there you happy?

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
That was good.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
You guys are wrapped.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
Thank you very much.

20:45.000 --> 20:52.000
It's exhilarating to be part of Hollywood, isn't it?

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
Like, show business.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
Probably.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
It's a lot of...

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
It's a very nice crowd.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
There's a lot of soft stuff.

21:00.000 --> 21:05.000
You'd expect one guy and there would be like a weird ninja star.

21:05.000 --> 21:09.000
Alright, so Phoenix, let's get back to getting to know you.

21:09.000 --> 21:15.000
We can't leave this town as we go on this tour.

21:15.000 --> 21:18.000
We want to come away with learning something about this town.

21:18.000 --> 21:21.000
I've been to Phoenix a couple of times and it's always been very quick,

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
so I don't really know much about it.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
So we have to, you know, we have tonight.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
I know incredibly little about Phoenix.

21:26.000 --> 21:32.000
Like, maybe we could solicit somebody to help learning about it.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
Who feels like they know...

21:34.000 --> 21:37.000
Who's lived here their whole life?

21:37.000 --> 21:40.000
Who's lived here their whole life?

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
Okay, we got a couple hands.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
You got hair right here?

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
Pam's friend.

21:45.000 --> 21:48.000
No, sitting across from Pam.

21:48.000 --> 21:52.000
You're both named Breanne?

21:52.000 --> 21:55.000
That's fine, doesn't it?

21:55.000 --> 21:58.000
You're both named Breanne?

21:58.000 --> 22:01.000
It's weird for me.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
Have you met before tonight?

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
You just met and you're both named Breanne.

22:05.000 --> 22:06.000
That's awesome.

22:06.000 --> 22:11.000
You guys are going to...

22:11.000 --> 22:14.000
Okay.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.000
All right.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
We've made a love connection over here.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
All right.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
Breanne, would you be willing to come up and talk to us for just a second?

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
We don't bully people at Harmontown.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
We're not going to make fun of you.

22:24.000 --> 22:27.000
Let's welcome Breanne at the stage, everybody.

22:27.000 --> 22:33.000
Well, you're both Breanne.

22:33.000 --> 22:38.000
All right, Breanne.

22:38.000 --> 22:41.000
I have no idea what we're doing with them.

22:41.000 --> 22:49.000
I know.

22:49.000 --> 22:53.000
I will have you.

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
I would like to learn more about Phoenix.

22:55.000 --> 22:58.000
So, both of you lived in Phoenix your whole lives?

22:58.000 --> 22:59.000
Yes.

22:59.000 --> 23:02.000
Okay.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
But you just met tonight.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
It's so weird.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
All right.

23:07.000 --> 23:12.000
So, what's the worst thing about Phoenix?

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
Summer.

23:14.000 --> 23:15.000
What did you say?

23:15.000 --> 23:16.000
Summer.

23:16.000 --> 23:17.000
Summer.

23:17.000 --> 23:18.000
Oh, because it gets hot.

23:18.000 --> 23:24.000
It's a dry heat, Jeff.

23:24.000 --> 23:28.000
Juice of research.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
What's the best thing?

23:30.000 --> 23:35.000
Are you proud to be citizens of Phoenix, Arizona?

23:35.000 --> 23:36.000
Phoenicians.

23:36.000 --> 23:39.000
I love that you guys are like an ancient civilization here.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
Yeah, that is cool.

23:40.000 --> 23:43.000
Are you guys about to invade the Carthaginians at some point?

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
I love that.

23:44.000 --> 23:45.000
I don't know.

23:45.000 --> 23:49.000
Personally, I think, for me, because I'm a musician,

23:49.000 --> 23:52.000
I think we have a really good local scene for music.

23:52.000 --> 23:53.000
What do you play?

23:53.000 --> 23:54.000
Guitar.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
You do?

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
Yeah.

23:56.000 --> 23:57.000
Have you got a guitar here?

23:57.000 --> 23:58.000
No.

23:58.000 --> 23:59.000
Is there a guitar in the house?

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
What do you play?

24:00.000 --> 24:03.000
It varies, but mostly rock.

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
You sing?

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
Kind of.

24:05.000 --> 24:06.000
You do?

24:06.000 --> 24:09.000
I could, I guess.

24:09.000 --> 24:12.000
Other brand?

24:12.000 --> 24:19.000
Do you think that if I were to improvise one of my incredible raps,

24:19.000 --> 24:24.000
that you could do the Rihanna or Dino hook?

24:24.000 --> 24:33.000
When I cued you, we could say, please come down to Harmontown.

24:33.000 --> 24:39.000
Don't turn your frown upside down.

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
P is yellow, poop is brown.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
I'm going down to Harmontown.

24:43.000 --> 24:46.000
Can you remember that?

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
Okay.

24:48.000 --> 24:54.000
Please come down to Harmontown.

24:54.000 --> 24:57.000
Wait, I already forgot it.

24:57.000 --> 25:01.000
Please come down to Harmontown.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
I forgot.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
I thought you were going to let her sing it.

25:04.000 --> 25:08.000
Yeah, I was trying to get her to remember the thing.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
Some of it smiles.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
Turn your frown upside down.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
P is yellow, poop is brown.

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
Come on down to Harmontown.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
Turn your frown upside down.

25:18.000 --> 25:21.000
P is yellow, poop is brown.

25:21.000 --> 25:26.000
Come on down to Harmontown.

25:26.000 --> 25:29.000
Turn your frown upside down.

25:29.000 --> 25:32.000
P is yellow, poop is brown.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
Come on down to Harmontown.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
And then you would rap.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
Brandy, you ready?

25:37.000 --> 25:40.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

25:40.000 --> 25:43.000
Got off the bus at about six o'clock.

25:43.000 --> 25:46.000
The city's so good I'd like to suck its cock.

25:46.000 --> 25:47.000
I'd like to Phoenix.

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
I'd like my penis.

25:49.000 --> 25:55.000
I'd like to swear I'm not Enos from Duke's of Hazard.

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
It predates you.

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
Don't worry about it.

25:59.000 --> 26:02.000
My name is Dan Harmon.

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
I'm here to entertain you.

26:04.000 --> 26:08.000
Come on down to Harmontown.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
Turn your frown upside down.

26:10.000 --> 26:13.000
P is yellow, poop is brown.

26:13.000 --> 26:17.000
Come on down to Harmontown.

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
Situations changing.

26:19.000 --> 26:22.000
I don't want to go around rearranging.

26:22.000 --> 26:25.000
I've got Breanna on my side in Phoenix.

26:25.000 --> 26:28.000
The only thing that ever rhymes with it is penis.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
But I'm going to fix that.

26:30.000 --> 26:31.000
I'm going to do different.

26:31.000 --> 26:35.000
But I'm not going to come up with anything different.

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
The rhymes are different.

26:37.000 --> 26:40.000
I'm a bad rapper, but I'm going to make a difference.

26:40.000 --> 26:43.000
Come on down to Harmontown.

26:43.000 --> 26:46.000
Turn that frown upside down.

26:46.000 --> 26:49.000
P is yellow, poop is brown.

26:49.000 --> 26:52.000
Come on down to Harmontown.

26:52.000 --> 26:55.000
Everything is spinning round me like roulette wheels.

26:55.000 --> 26:58.000
I want to touch your mama's titties and give her feels.

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
I want to slap my hand up her ass crack.

27:00.000 --> 27:04.000
I want to go up in front of her and come up back around the back.

27:04.000 --> 27:07.000
I want to drive her down to the store by her ham.

27:07.000 --> 27:10.000
I want to fuck your mama like I fucked Pam.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
I'm sorry about that.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
I'm so sorry about that.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
I'm so sorry.

27:16.000 --> 27:19.000
Come on down to Harmontown.

27:19.000 --> 27:22.000
Turn that frown upside down.

27:22.000 --> 27:25.000
P is yellow, poop is brown.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
Motherfucker.

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
One more time everybody.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
Come on down to Harmontown.

27:31.000 --> 27:34.000
Turn that frown upside down.

27:34.000 --> 27:37.000
P is yellow, poop is brown.

27:37.000 --> 27:40.000
Come on down to Harmontown.

27:40.000 --> 27:43.000
I want to struggle with my insides.

27:43.000 --> 27:46.000
I want to fuck your mama so hard.

27:46.000 --> 27:49.000
I ordered two pounds of ham with maple syrup.

27:49.000 --> 27:52.000
I went to Phoenix and that was all I did.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
Damn it.

27:54.000 --> 27:57.000
Jeff, you're going to do a verse.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
I fucking suck tonight.

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
Arizona.

28:01.000 --> 28:04.000
I'd like to lease you or maybe own you.

28:04.000 --> 28:07.000
I want to date you for a while.

28:07.000 --> 28:10.000
I'll fuck your frown into a smile.

28:10.000 --> 28:13.000
I'll put my dick into your nose until it turns into an ear.

28:13.000 --> 28:17.000
I'll fuck your head until it turns into your rear.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
Yo, I want unravel.

28:19.000 --> 28:23.000
I like the way your front yards are sometimes made of gravel.

28:23.000 --> 28:26.000
Yeah, yeah.

28:26.000 --> 28:29.000
Yo, this song goes out to Rosa Parks.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
Yeah.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
All right.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
Breanna, she's got to close it.

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
She's got to close it.

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
Wait, let me set you up.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
I got to rap more.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
I came to Phoenix with a fear in my heart,

28:48.000 --> 28:51.000
but now I realize all I got to do is lay apart

28:51.000 --> 28:54.000
because they're good people.

28:54.000 --> 28:57.000
They're very forgiving of a very untalented person.

28:57.000 --> 29:00.000
Yo, Dan, you were afraid of all the people that you see,

29:00.000 --> 29:04.000
but it turns out that woman over there was actually Bobby Lee.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
Yo, I thought he was Rachel Dratch,

29:06.000 --> 29:10.000
but Phoenix has unlocked my heart from the latch.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
Stupid, stupid-ass rhymes.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
Don't try to think ahead.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
Sucks all the time.

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
I'm fat. I got fired by NBC.

29:18.000 --> 29:22.000
Now I'm here and I'm rapping for you and me.

29:22.000 --> 29:25.000
Come on down to Harmontown.

29:25.000 --> 29:28.000
Turn your frown upside down.

29:28.000 --> 29:31.000
P is yellow, poop is brown.

29:31.000 --> 29:34.000
Come on down to Harmontown.

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
Yeah.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
Breanna.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
Let's hear it for the Breanns.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
That was good.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
I don't...

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
Harmontown T-shirts.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
Harmontown T-shirts.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
Available out front. Thank you, McCarthy.

29:56.000 --> 29:59.000
Still haven't learned that much about Phoenix.

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
No.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
That summer is bad.

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
And what was good about it? Oh, the music scene.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
You liked the music scene.

30:07.000 --> 30:10.000
Wish we had a guitar so Breann could play something for us.

30:10.000 --> 30:13.000
I wish that we could just find somebody to do every part of the show.

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
It was like...

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
There would be a guy in the front that's got a funny hat.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
I do comedy.

30:21.000 --> 30:24.000
Oh shit, Bobby Lee's here. Let's bring him up.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
I feel...

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
It's insecure. It's when you go on a tour.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
It's hard. You leave your comfort zone.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
It's $22. It's tough.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
How about those Gator Sanders?

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
No.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
Sun Devils. Sun Valley.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
They call you the Sun Valley.

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
Are there Wildcat fans out there instead?

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
Is that the thing?

30:48.000 --> 30:51.000
American Express corporate headquarters.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
Yeah.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
U-Haul.

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
Wikipedia.

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
I learned it.

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
Where are we going next? We're going to Austin.

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
We're going to Austin, Texas.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
As soon as the show is over we have to get right in the bus and drive.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
I would do that anyway.

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
Because I hate myself.

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
I wouldn't hang out.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
I would run to the bus

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
and count their delicious money.

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
Dan,

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
whatever happens tonight,

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
Phoenix, Arizona is the city

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
where you discover that pee is yellow

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
and poop is brown.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
It took a lot of doing, but we figured it out.

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
We have to figure one thing out

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
as we go from city to city.

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
Because I want to start a colony on the moon.

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
The end times are coming for real.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
Now that 2012 is over, we can really say that.

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
It was hype before, but I'm really convinced now.

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
We're going to just get out of here.

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
I want to create a system of rules

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
when we get there

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
so that we can have a simple society.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
And I want it to be based on as few rules as possible.

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
And I think the first rule should be

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
that nobody should ever do anything

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
that anyone else doesn't

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
want them to do.

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
But then

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
it gets really complicated.

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
I'm trying to figure out

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
how to create

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
a constitution for Harmontown.

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
And I need help doing that.

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
I want somebody to tell me

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
I'm going to close my eyes.

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
Who?

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
That's all leave.

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
I would notice.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
Who had the worst day today?

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
Who's here in spite of having

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
the worst day?

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
Who thinks they had the worst day?

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
Would you be willing to come up here?

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
We don't pick on you, obviously.

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
I am the enemy.

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
You're a hero for coming up.

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
What's your name, sir?

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
Ben?

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
I'll give you this one.

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
Sit next to him.

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
Make it cute. Make it romantic.

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
You'll be like the two brands.

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
The chords are getting tangled.

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
Streams are crossed.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
I'm sorry about that song

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
about Justin's mom.

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
I'm really nervous coming here.

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
I've made a lot of mistakes tonight.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
But I could tell immediately

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
when you said you played Scrabble out there

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
that that was my kind of bad day.

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
The best word I played was

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
cat.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
It wasn't the fact that you played Scrabble out there.

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
It was the fact that you did badly at it.

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
I play Scrabble every day.

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
So a good day would be

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
if you got a cue on the triple word start.

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
If you played

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
quinoa.

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
Is this Scramble with friends?

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
I don't know.

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
If you played

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
quinoa.

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
Is this Scramble with friends by any chance?

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
No.

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
It's online with strangers.

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
We say gg

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
and how are you.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
Occasionally you get the guy that's like

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
you want to go have sex somewhere.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
Wait, that happens in online Scrabble games?

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
Or people will be talking about

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
sex while you're there

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
and you're just watching and you have to say

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
wait, wait, wait, wait.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
What's the URL?

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
It's on pogo.com.

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
I'm blown away by this.

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
The people will use that as a medium.

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
Yeah, there's rooms.

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
Where you go in and it's like Mrs.

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
Neticut's Nightmare and it's uncensored chat.

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
And you go in and people can

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
But they're playing Scrabble.

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
You're playing Scrabble, right?

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
And you'll put words that are suggested

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
like sexy.

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
What if they don't have the right letters

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
and they end up with a pickle in their ass

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
even though they didn't want it.

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
I wish it's a dickle.

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
I have so many questions but we'd be here all night.

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
I don't care if it takes all fucking night.

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
We're not going to Austin

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
until we get to the bottom of this.

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
So you get in a place called

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
Pogo.com

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
They have different rooms.

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
It's literally Scrabble

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
or it's a Scrabble type game.

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
It's Scrabble.

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
But it's understood that the different rooms

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
Scrabble isn't endorsing this.

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
Parker Bradley or whatever the hell.

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
They're not going hey, here's a room

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
for the Transgenders

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
and here's the room for the Femme Doms

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
and the Flim Flams.

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
Scrabble is just assuming

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
it's supposed to be getting together in Scrabble games

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
but people have co-opted that culture

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
turned it into yet another way

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
to fuck each other

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
which is both uplifting and horrifying.

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
A guy yelled out

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
Minecraft is next.

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
I'm in the uncomfortable position of having to repeat

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
everything that everyone yells out

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
because the mics won't pick them up.

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
Your bad day

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
was because you got a low score.

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
I never broke 200

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
which is Scrabble.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
Do you go there to play Scrabble

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
or to meet people?

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
I play Scrabble.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
I play Battleship.

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
Answer the question.

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
I go there to play Scrabble.

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
You're a Scrabble fan.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
Meanwhile there's people

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
just fucking and sucking on there.

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
It's hard not to respond to these people.

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
What's your name again?

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
Ben.

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
Follow your heart, Ben.

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
On a good day

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
someone would

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
offer to blow you and you'd beat them at Scrabble.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
Yeah, and I would say suck it.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
So today was a bad day at Suck It

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
and I beat you.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
So

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
from a day to day

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
how do you support yourself?

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
You don't win money from them.

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
In the meantime are you logging

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
video for a reality show?

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
In the meantime

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
I deliver pizzas.

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
Oh.

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
Well, that's got to get

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
in the way, doesn't it?

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
Yeah, it kind of gets in the way.

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
Somebody orders a pizza and you

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
have to finish being propositioned

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
by someone who

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
only has the letters

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
to spell cat.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
So Ben, you're up here

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
because you had the worst day

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
although I have to say

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
it seems like a pretty good day in Phoenix.

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
Yeah.

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
I guess my thought was

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
that we would start with somebody who was

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
really down and try to start

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
in Phoenix.

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
Dig deeper.

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
What really gets you down?

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
What are you worried about?

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
Let's start with this.

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
Aside from winning Scrabble

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
what would you really want to do

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
if you could do anything?

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
You can do that

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
if you want to.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
Like career wise,

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
musician or writer

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
or rocking chair builder?

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
I would be a writer or musician.

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
Jesus, alright.

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
Just very impressionable.

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
Yeah, what else?

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
What else you got?

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
And you're delivering pizzas.

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
How old are you?

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
22.

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
So you get plenty of time, you don't care.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
Well...

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
I'm at a loss here.

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
Did you go to college?

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
Kind of, yeah.

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
I went to community college

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
and then I hurt my back really bad

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
and I got out of college.

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
You sprained your study bone?

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
Yeah.

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
I herniated some discs in my back.

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
Oh shit, so you were probably laid up for a while.

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
Yeah. I put on like 60 pounds.

39:19.000 --> 39:23.000
Oh.

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
Alright.

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
That's terrible.

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
So you got hurt, you gained a bunch of weight

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
because you're laying in bed

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
probably the whole time?

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
Yeah, I'm playing Scrabble.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
Are you still hurt?

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
That's what started the Scrabble thing.

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
No, but I choose to lay in bed still

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
just because I got so used to it

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
that it's comfy.

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
I got a really nice bed.

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
I got my gift for hurting my back

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
because I got a really, really comfortable bed.

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
And I love it.

39:57.000 --> 40:01.000
This is the worst day in Phoenix.

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
I don't think we should leave.

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
It's Phoenix, yeah.

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
I think we've wandered into...

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
This might be paradise here.

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
Is everyone else out there just like

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
drinking margaritas all day?

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
They buy you a comfy bed, you play Scrabble

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
and someone comes over and fucks you.

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
And then you go to a show and you go,

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
I had the worst day out of everybody.

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
But we did have to pull teeth to get up

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
and he wasn't saying right away.

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
I guess I'm

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
thrown for a loop here because I thought,

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
okay, somebody had a really bad day.

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
We would get to the bottom

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
with some real angst here,

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
but I think what we're finding out is that Phoenix is just heaven

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
and we should just roll with that

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
concept that Phoenix is a great place to be.

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
You're booing

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
the idea that your town

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
is a great place to be.

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
Oh, the Tucson people.

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
I can't keep up with the factionalism.

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
We should get a representative

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
from Tucson and Phoenix

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
to have it out up here.

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
Yeah, okay.

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
Where are you from, Ben?

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
I'm from Mesa.

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
Mesa?

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
Wait, I think

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
I think my buddy

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
Great Prips is from Mesa,

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
I think so.

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
Jimmy Eat World is from Mesa, I think.

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
Who? Jimmy Eat World?

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
Who's that?

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
They're that band that sings the

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
hey, you find yourself okay

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
in your head you only feel left out.

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
It just takes some time.

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
You can find it, yeah.

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
Yeah.

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
Take it, Ben.

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
Yo, yo, yo.

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
Yo. Okay.

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
Yo, yo, yo.

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
Chilling with Dan,

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
sitting on the can.

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
I got a fart, but I can't.

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
I uh...

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
Spit it, Dan.

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
Spell and Scrabble letters

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
happen people tell me

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
they wanna have sex with me

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
my name is Ben

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
I don't know what to do anymore

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
but lay down with myself

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
fucked around all day

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
hurt my back again

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
going back and forth

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
cut it, cut it.

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
Yo, Ben.

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
I heard you played Scrabble.

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
You could win life's raffles

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
you say you'd be a writer

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
or a musician but

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
I don't know what to believe

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
not eternal admission.

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
Stupid.

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
Can I say some things to you, Ben?

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
Just cut the music.

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
I'm a terrible...

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
I am the one in the room

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
having the worst day.

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
Okay.

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
How much more does the truth

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
have to stare me in the face?

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
I...

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
I'm absolutely happy, self-activated

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
and forgiving

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
I'm sorry

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
I am a fucking wreck

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
I came into town

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
and I don't feel comfortable

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
in a stand-up club

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
I'm trying too hard

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
I don't like myself

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
I'm not fishing for anything

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
it has to stop

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
something has to give

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
I'm a bad, bad person

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
I don't understand why I would leave Los Angeles

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
in the country

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
in a $100,000 bus

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
going hey look at me

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
broadcasting to the country

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
now we gotta go to Austin

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
now what the fuck are we gonna do?

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
Patton asked what was wrong about one thing

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
Phoenix is amazing

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
he was right about one thing

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
I'm dead, I'm dead on the water

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
I'm burnt out

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
I can't do it

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
I wish I was dead

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
I'm a bad person

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
okay

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
you gotta pick up the pieces

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
and move on

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
you gotta

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
find a way to move on

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
you gotta move on

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
you gotta do so good

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
you're kinda funny when you try

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
yeah?

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
no, you're really funny

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
you're hilarious

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
I gotta move on, right?

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
yeah

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
gotta move on

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
and get my groove on

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
I'm kinda funny when I try

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
but not why

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
tell me why

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
cause your mind is a funny

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
mind

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
maybe Dan

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
go sit down next to Ben

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
get back over there

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
maybe Ben should be asking you the questions

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
yeah, yeah, what do you wanna ask?

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
we're doing this tour

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
and we still don't know why you're doing this

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
why you're putting yourself through all this

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
I don't know, they don't know

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
Bobby Lee doesn't know

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
Gary, do you one thing this fucking club doesn't know?

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
they're like

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
oh man

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
maybe it's time for

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
he can dig deeper into you

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
Ben

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
what have you always wanted to know about me?

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
I promise

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
I'm sure

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
you stay up in your orthopedic bed

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
no

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
there's no such thing as an orthopedic bed

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
that means foot

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
I'm sure you stay up at night

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
asking yourself things about me

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
now is your big chance

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
ask me

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
if you could be anything

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
what would you be?

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
a professional entertainer

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
a person with an act

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
a person that knew how

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
to make people happy

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
thank you

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
thank you

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
thank you dad

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
thank you

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
my dad's from Phoenix did you know

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
here's another thing I want to be

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
someone who doesn't make people say things like that

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
I don't want to be a drain on people

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
I don't want to be a person who makes people

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
feel his void

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
I want to come out

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
and do like a thing

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
all right

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
Ben

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
I think I got it

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
we can wipe the slate clean

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
can you

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
MC for me and introduce me

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
and I'll come out

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
and

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
I'm going to do this for real

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
I'm going to earn this venue

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
okay

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
oh wait

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
hold on

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
just a little more insecurity

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
put this here

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
all right Ben

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
use this mic

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
and then introduce me like you're an MC

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
at a stand up club

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
and then I'll come up

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
you

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
ladies and gentlemen

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
please welcome

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
Dan Harmon

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
the entertainer

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
fuck

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
Jesus Christ

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
what is this

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
a picture of your city

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
or a fucking

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
or a blurry photo

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
I got to tell you

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
I'd rather be in Tucson

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
okay

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
hey keep it going for Ben

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
you're an MC tonight

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
and Brian

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
I'll tell you

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
I'll tell you something

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
I've seen guys

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
with shirts on before

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
but I didn't know

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
whether to look at them

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
or

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
or

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
or not look at them

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
fuck

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
pretty interesting

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
coming here tonight

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
Dan I want to stop you

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
I think that you got close

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
to an emotional connection there with Ben

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
and Ben was about to draw something out of you

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
because I think Ben came up there

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
and I'm not joking Ben came up

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
and talked about his injury

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
and what he went through

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
there was a moment there where everybody like

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
oh my god the fucking

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
buzz went away

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
it was Ben

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
that was optional all night

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
that was driving me mad

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
oh Jesus I didn't want to say anything

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
because I didn't want

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
if you didn't notice it I don't want to call your attention to it

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
because then you notice it

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
that's why Patton also hates Phoenix

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
because of that fucking buzz

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
and that's why I'm a bad entertainer

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
it's the buzz

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
I was

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
the buzz is gone now everything's

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
now I'm great

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
that's what I was going to say

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
Ben a complete stranger

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
I would guess not

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
a professional entertainer comes on stage

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
sits down reveals something

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
honest and true for a moment

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
and there was that moment where I felt

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
I think everybody in the room felt this connection

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
oh that's why he's bummed out

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
it's not about Scrabble

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
it's about the fact that he's injured

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
it was a moment we got close to

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
revealing something about you we got close to it

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
I don't think we got all the way

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
like in silence

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
I didn't hear it because I was too busy

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
trying to figure out what to say next

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
yeah I mean that's a bummer

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
you decided to do this tour

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
and you come out and stand there with a microphone

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
you feel this onus to

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
to live up to Bobby Lee

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
and the guy with the Hawaiian shirt

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
and the downhole

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
Gallagher lady

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
yeah

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
yeah I want people to order

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
a pound and a half of

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
bacon ham and

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
with syrup and I want them to relax

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
and have a good time I want to be the reason

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
they were entertained

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
yes but then I can't

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
yeah I'm outside the moment

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
like well I'm doing I'm like how do I do it right

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
how do I do it right

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
it doesn't seem like the venue

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
to talk about

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
you know what's going on

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
in my life

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
because it's

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
you hear the silence and the silence

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
seems fine in the back of a comic book store

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
but it doesn't seem okay

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
you can see the glow of the cash register

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
and the posters

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
of Rob Schneider and stuff

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
it feels weird

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
and they drove

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
places they drove from

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
Tempe and Mesa and Tucson

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
and they deserve

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
they deserve better

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
and you love me

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
it's a surefire way to lose my respect

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
I hate myself

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
awesome

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
thank you I suck

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
yes I suck thank you

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
but I rule

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
shut up

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
wait you're heckling the audience

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
hey nice shirt

51:11.000 --> 51:17.000
you guys you call yourselves an audience

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
you can't boother

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
what was my worst day

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
someone said tell me about your worst day

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
what was my worst day

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
someone at 7 yelled out

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
show in Phoenix

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
no no no I'm having a good time

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
because you guys are nice

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
what is a bad day for you

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
what is the worst sort of day

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
for you

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
when what is or is not happening

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
honestly my worst days are

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
it's not on Ben Scrabble's thing

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
it's about monotony

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
it's about the nightmare

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
what am I doing

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
it's like when I owe

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
a network

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
a script and I told

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
him I'd have it to him by Monday

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
and then another day goes by

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
and I stare at the screen

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
and I end up masturbating

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
a lot and stuff

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
and then I go to bed

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
and then I wake up

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
and I go the script's still late

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
but my penis hurts

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
wait wait

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
I just came to this earth

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
like God made me

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
like made me out of clay

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
put me down on earth 40 years ago

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
said go to it do some things

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
here I'll even give you a couple of extra

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
abilities like you can hear

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
you can type

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
over 100 words a minute

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
here's a bonus

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
you can be very

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
handsome he gave me that bonus

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
he'll be a very good looking man

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
no I'm kidding I'm just a joke

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
and then you feel like you squandered it

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
you wake up and you just feel like a bad person

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
I think that's what drew me out here

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
I want something I want to feel

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
like I do something

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
for a living

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
I'm not a writer

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
maybe I always

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
wanted to be an entertainer

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
what's going on

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
alright

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
was that Ben?

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
Ben's friend he's engaging me

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
he's not heckling

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
he's in my fucking soul

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
what's your name?

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
Tyler what?

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
Tyler Dandy

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
Tyler Dandy

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
Tyler Dandy is up in my shit

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
so you're lozenges

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
I don't know

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
it just feels like a guy that would make

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
lozenges

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
what's the

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
I have to check the

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
time because we have to

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
we have to do something special

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
9.20

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
does that put us into D&D time?

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
when do we start? 8.20?

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
I don't know if any of you are fans

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
of Dungeons & Dragons

53:57.000 --> 54:01.000
Dungeon Master Spencer

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
I think it's

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
this issue hasn't been resolved

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
see me after the show and punch me

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
I'll give you your money back

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
and I'll cry

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
I'll sign something for you too

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
let's bring

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
Spencer up to the stage

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
Dungeon Master

54:19.000 --> 54:23.000

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
yeah I got everyone

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
to bring my girlfriend

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
the lovely Erin McGathy

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
so I just want to make sure

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
before we proceed any further

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
there's nobody in the audience

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
who got a phone call a couple days ago

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
from stand up live

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
that said you want a contest

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
the limo will pick you up

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
there's a 6 drink minimum

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
alright

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
like they'd say yes

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
some lady in the back going

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
I don't understand what's happening

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
babe it's going great

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
I'm not fishing for that

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
in our campaign

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
alright

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
last time

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
our heroes had met with lord butzolot

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
of the butzolot barbarians

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
the group had been puzzling over the fragments of power

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
those shards of great arcane energy

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
but unsuccessful

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
in the wreckage of the white skull encampment

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
a horse-drawn wagon approached

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
Sharpie and crew

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
the wagon opened up revealing a magical storefront

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
in a halfling merchant by the name of Olaf

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
while quark and Olaf haggled over scrolls

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
and portable holes

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
Sharpie had a heart to heart with his father

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
not long after

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
the group heard a strange noise

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
loosing avenger

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
Sharpie's familiar

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
the hawk scouted out the enemy

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
the group slew the displacer beast

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
but the piece was short-lived

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
a large rift opened in the sky

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
and out poured the black fleet of admiral darkstar

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
the fleet launched many black cylinders

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
which impacted the earth with heavy

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
thuds

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
that's where we left off

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
so admiral darkstar is

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
yeah, Spencer everybody

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
that makes sense

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
we're on a tour bus with a dungeon master

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
I don't know if that

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
maybe at first, yeah

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
we still don't really

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
Spencer, you got fans out there, man

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
I'm glad

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
I mean, there are Tucson fans

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
we were warning, Spencer

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
who's not accustomed to this

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
was like, Spencer's got his own fans out there

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
you're gonna have to get used to that, Spencer

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
you're a celebrity now

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
I guess

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
oh, thank you

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
yeah, we're on the bus with Spencer

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
we still don't know anything about him

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
we know that he works in the back of an apple store

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
that he lives with his parents

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
and I may or may not have brought weapons

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
wait, for real?

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
he never sleeps

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
he can't sleep, yeah

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
you don't sleep?

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
are you an insomniac?

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
tried it once, didn't like it

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
no, I do sleep

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
I'm a human

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
that's that, you protest too much

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
yeah, spoken like a robot

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
I've never

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
said I'm a human

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
I've never plucked into any sockets

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
so right now, this giant thuds

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
crashing around this from Admiral Darkstar

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
Admiral Darkstar's fleet has been pursuing everyone

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
or it's been

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
unleashing on the plane

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
are we in danger right now?

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
you see several large

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
black cylinders, thudding to the ground

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
mysteriously, you don't know if this is danger

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
but it doesn't bode well

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
ha ha, quark

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
quark, Sharpie, I was

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
following behind you, I was only a few miles behind

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
I had some business with some birds

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
I

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
heard the thuds, I'm here to help

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
I have plenty of arrows and a great

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
sense of adventure

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
go run into those

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
thudding cylinders and find out what they are

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
I was also thinking

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
shoot them on the feet

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
shoot them on the feet

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
I am brave

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
and I am not a very smart character

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
so I inspect

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
the thuds, is that possible?

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
you see what looks to be a large black

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
cylinder, it's at least four feet

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
tall and about a foot and a half wide

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
its surface is black and unlocked marked

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
shiny like metal

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
I found a table everybody

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
you found a cylindrical table?

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
I found

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
a 1980s coke table

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
ha ha ha ha

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
I

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
I detect magic on it

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
ha ha ha

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
nice, you detect magic

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
coming from the cylinders

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
kind of figured that would happen

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
swiftly the black ships sail overhead

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
they're going towards the west

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
mango Buttsalot's face grows

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
cold, my cap

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
your cap? my camp

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
I don't enunciate well

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
you were

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
unconscious for a while

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
your camp

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
is leaving or they're going towards his camp

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
it looks like it

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
to me my barbarians

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
his barbarians approach him and suddenly

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
he swirls his cloak in a vicious flourish

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
he's gone

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
as are his barbarians

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
they're walking away, he didn't teleport

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
he teleported

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
so he just went poof

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
magic is a thing that exists

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
in the world you're in

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
I know but my dad

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
he's just a guy that eats trash

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
who knows what other magic things he has

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
he didn't even say goodbye

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
so he's going back to his camp

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
you don't even know man

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
you saw a large group of men just disappear

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
but he said my camp

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
yeah so I mean that's a fair assumption

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
he's not

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
going to Taco Bell

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
you never know he loves his tacos

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
are the columns making any

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
noise after they fall to the ground

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
it's funny that you should mention

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
you hear the worry and clicking of mechanics

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
and clockwork gears

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
slowly the cylinders begin to lift out of the grass

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
floating in midair

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
they hang there

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
strangely menacingly

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
you're being menaced by cylinders

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
it won't be the last time

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
do we have to confront these cylinders

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
or should we just get the hell out of there

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
I don't know man

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
I'm sorry

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
you can't ask me what to do

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
that's the thing

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
how big are the cylinders

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
they're four foot tall but one

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
they're round and they're metallic

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
four foot tall cylinders

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
that are sitting on the ground

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
or they were

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
they're floating

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
they're menacingly hovering

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
there's clockwork sounds coming out of them

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
this ain't no benign hovering

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
quite

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
sharpie I'll be brave

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
I'll inspect the

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
the columns the floating columns

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
I feel like I should prepare

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
in some way

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
and that includes with my hands

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
I also inspect with my hands

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
you search the column

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
for any markings or

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
demarcations or marks

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
you don't see anything

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
the surface is clean

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
there's nothing here gentlemen

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
alright well let's pack it in

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
you hear a loud obnoxious siren

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
emitting from the cylinders

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
siren siren

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
you feel sick to your stomachs

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
oh

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
oh

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
Jeff and Dan are fine but Mulraine is

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
I'm sorry Quark and Sharpie are fine

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
but Mulraine is afflicted with sickness

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
ohhh

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
I gotta sit down

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
excuse me I will stand behind this tree

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
I know what this feeling

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
feel it means

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
and I'd like to be alone

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
you're so sick that you think there's a tree

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
I'm sick

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
what?

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
yes

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
well in

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
would I say tree I mean just some sort of obstruction

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
yes

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
you're behind it now

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
alright

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
can I ask what my spell Mage Hand is

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
Mage Hand allows you to levitate light objects

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
up to five pounds

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
they're already levitating you don't treat them

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
what about

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
I just found out I can perform the loot

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
should I place some loot right now is that a bad time

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
you're gonna throw a knife at the moon

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
what?

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
you can play the loot

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
I'm kidding I don't wanna play the loot

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
I have listened

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
I go up to one of the cylinders

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
and I listen it's emitting a loud obnoxious siren

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
that's making you feel kind of sick

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
I stop listening to it

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
I produce

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
my crystal shard

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
you produce your crystal shard

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
it's not crystal whatever it is

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
that shard thing

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
the fragment of power is produced

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
thank you

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
I produce mine as well do I still have one

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
and we kind of rub them together

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
just the tips of them

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
I produce a different kind of shard

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
you

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
you

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
that's like my first poop joke I've ever made

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
sorry everybody

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
you poop shards

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
that might be useful

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
do our

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
do our two shards have any magical powers

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
together

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
you touch them together right

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
we're rubbing our shards nothing's happening

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
not happening

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
I walk toward

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
one of the cylinders with the shard

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
this is the biggest idiots in the world

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
from anyone's perspective

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
cylinders are hanging

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
are there any D&D fans out there

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
who know what to do and we don't

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
what

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
take out your flesh knife

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
you play Scrabble

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
whatever it really was

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
the guy that was playing Scrabble with Ben

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
two of the cylinders rise up

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
and fly towards you

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
and strike both Quark and Sharpie

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
in the chest

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
oh no

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
not fun

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
I use Alchemist's Fire

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
alright

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
so that's a thrown weapon

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
Quark takes 6 damage

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
Sharpie takes 2 damage

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
throw the Alchemist's Fire

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
it hits

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
it does 4 damage

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
the cylinder is now on fire

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
great

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
it's exactly what I wanted

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
you both relax

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
feel free to lie next to each other

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
use each other's bodies for comfort

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
can I take out my bag of holding

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
and remove one of these from the sky

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
is that a bad idea

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
remove one of what

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
can I throw my bag of holding over one of the cylinders

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
that would be a tricky move

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
it might be possible do you attempt

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
no I take out portable hole

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
and I make them fall into a portable hole

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
and it will float so it doesn't fall in a hole

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
I oh

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
sorry

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
I take out my loot

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
you play okay

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
can I ask you a question Spencer

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
about one of my spells

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
any of them

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
detect thoughts

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
detect thoughts would probably not work

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
on metallic entities

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
things with brains

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
well I mean you could do and detect nothing

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Spencer may I use an anchor

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
do you have an anchor

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
okay so you have qual's feather token

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
that's a token that can turn into an anchor

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
may I use qual's feather token

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
to anchor the

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
things on fire

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
to the ground

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
adventure

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
you toss the token

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
it doesn't do anything

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
it falls on the ground

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
sorry gentlemen

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
I take off all my clothes

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
and I go right under one of these things

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
they're floating in the air right

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
like I take off my robe

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
and I lay naked under it

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
and I look up at it

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
and I go

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
nothing happens

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
I think we should

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
just go I think we could just leave

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
are we

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
these friends are foe

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
they just attacked us I took

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
our six damage

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
I keep doing it but I have a thing here

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
I take out my mysterious emerald dagger

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
and I go into

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
a rage

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
producing your emerald dagger

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
you fly into a barbarian rage

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
your mind clouds

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
with anger and rage

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
you can't think clearly

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
I attack

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
you attack in your rage

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
you attack a cylinder

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
the flaming cylinder yes

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
you miss really hard

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
in your rage

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
you can't hit anything

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
out of my rage

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
you end your rage

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
you feel slightly fatigued

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
I slowly put my clothes back on

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
you re-robe

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
I watch and giggle uncomfortably

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
and pretend that I'm writing

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
you hear a loud crackling noise

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
lightning is arcing between the cylinders

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
the three of you are struck

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
by bolts of lightning

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
oh

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
all right

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
Sharpie takes six damage

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
Quark takes three and Mulrainee takes one

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
haha

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
strongest

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
so we're fighting two giant thermoses right now

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
we're getting our asses kicked

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
three, three thermoses

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
anybody out there know what to do

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
these are just references

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
they're very loving

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
rare frost

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
what are water skins

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
those are like bags that hold water

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
they're necessary

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
I do a power attack

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
you do a power attack

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
you can choose between one and three

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
three is the most damage

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
one is the least damage

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
three all right

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
you hit

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
you deal

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
this is so slow you guys

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
12 damage

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
fuck yeah

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
wow

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
the cylinder splinters into fragments

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
and falls to the ground and hurt

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
fragments not those

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
not shards

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
fragments all right

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
rare frost

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
wow

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
a lot of rare frost fans out there

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
they love it they love the ray

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
it misses

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
haha

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
come on Mulrainee

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
shoot a thing

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
these cylinders

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
they didn't even do anything wrong

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
are they both

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
one knocked me in the chest

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
if you hang out long enough they will eventually attack you

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
are they both on the ground

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
or just one one of them is dead

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
the other two are floating around

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
okay I

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
take two arrows

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
and I split them into a V

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
which is something I do all the time

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
I split them into a V

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
and I pull them back

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
with my two eyes that are able to go

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
two different ways like a fish

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
I pull them back and fire them

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
are they both hit

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
haha adventure

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
that's a first

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
well done

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
one of them takes five

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
the other takes twelve

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
they are not dead but they seem a bit

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
messed up broken

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
what's wounded for a machine

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
broken

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
malfunctioning

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
that area

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
I got nothing here

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
well luckily it's the cylinder's turn again

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
oh

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
Mulrainee and Quark

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
you take damage of some sort

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
six and five damage

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
so six and five damage

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
how am I doing here

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
you're not doing so hot

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
you have like heel-moderate wounds or something

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
you always think you do but you never have

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
you do have a pendant of healing

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
my healing pendants

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
I put on my healing pendants

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
it's put on

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
it has to boot up

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
if you recall

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
I'll reboot

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
can I take my water skins

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
they're taken

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
so I'm holding my water skins

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
I throw my water skins

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
at the two

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
floating columns

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
feeling sickened

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
you seem a bit uneasy

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
but you attempt this strange maneuver

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
one of the water skins

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
strikes

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
lightning arcs across the surface of the disc

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
and it falls to the floor

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
aha

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
alright

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
I was studying my sheet

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
you knocked a disc off of a

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
they're weak to water

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
oh

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
I have water skins too

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
good

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
I do the same thing

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
it's not, it's Dan's turn

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
you still have to boot up

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
alright

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
I cast ray of water

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
it's a bit of a stretch

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
is that a real thing

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
no it's not

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
I thought I could lie

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
just pee on it

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
yeah

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
you took your clothes off earlier

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
it's not much of a stretch

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
alright I try, I don't have water skins

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
I try to pee on it

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
can I roll for your bladder fullness

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
oh shit

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
you manage a petty stream

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
it is but a trickle

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
did I

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
did I hit it?

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
you barely hit the ground

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
it almost evaporates

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
I don't get why people find this funny

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
just to pee on robot cylinders

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
it's all I can think to do

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
I have three sheets

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
that was smart of Mulraine to use water

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
is it my turn yet?

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
I take my water skin out and do whatever the hell she did

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
you aren't as accurate with a throw as Mulraine

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
but you do attempt it

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
oh that's a good roll

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
you strike the cylinder

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
water splashes across its surface

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
it's too false to the ground

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
inert

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
are they all gone?

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
good job

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
okay so we beat up three cylinders

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
we don't know if they were trying to help us

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
are they full of skittles or something

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
we open one and it's just Jesus Christ

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
isn't it

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
good job

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
I go up to one of the cylinders

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
and I spryly jump upon it

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
and try to open it

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
you spryly jump upon it

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
I have a huge smile on my face and a really cute hat

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
where'd you get the hat

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
from Olaf?

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
yeah he dropped it out of his

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
wagon

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
she has a hat you guys

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
okay you do this

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
nothing happens

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
maybe battle robots

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
aren't full of treasure

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
I touch

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
one of them with a shard

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
it's not going to do anything

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
these ships just drop some

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
robot poop

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
and we just stood here and fought

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
them

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
but now your dad is after his encampment

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
I said we ride toward the encampment

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
and now that we beat these cylinders

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
I think these were sent by a greater force

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
an evil force

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
if we had just left

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
in the first place would they have followed us?

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
I don't know

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
we've got to try different things

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
different approaches

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
I keep trying to run away

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
urinating almost worked

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
I guess we

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
walk off into the distance

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
and the camera stays behind

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
I do like a Judd Nelson

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
breakfast club fist in the air

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
and freeze frame

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
which will conclude

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
the Dungeons & Dragons chapter

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
because there was no treasure

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
let's hear from Spencer everybody

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
thank you Spencer

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
we fought some cylinders

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
do you hear that Austin?

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
when we get to Austin

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
we're going to

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
continue that

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
Dungeons & Dragons story

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
I'll see you guys at the merch table

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
two t-shirts for $25

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
Erin McGathy everyone

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
that did

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
in the past

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
we fought a big jello because that's a story we told

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
and we fought other things

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
are we missing some metaphor with the cylinders?

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
I felt very metaphorical

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
in my self loathing

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
I couldn't have

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
overstated

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
how badly I thought I did here

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
at stand-up live in Phoenix

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
there was no better way to end it

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
than fighting a cylinder

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
not really knowing what to do and peeing

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
and not hitting the cylinder

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
it felt very appropriate

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
we're missing a grander point

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
we're not?

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
sometimes you fight monsters

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
okay

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
is there a name for that kind of monster?

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
it's the cylinder monster

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
cylinder monster

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
it's a cylindrical construct

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
I love it

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
alright so now next time

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
we're off to go find

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
your father mango Buttsalot

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
at the barbarian encampment

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
let's learn one thing about Spencer before he goes

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
let's each city

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
let's learn 20 things

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
watch me

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
Spencer

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
is there any detail

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
you're willing to divulge about yourself that you think nobody knows?

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
I have a condition

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
known as syndactyly

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
that means two of my toes on either foot

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
are kind of fused together

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
whoa

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
see this foot

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
can we see it?

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
yeah

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
okay Spencer's now taking his shoes off

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
I've never seen anything like this

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
we're making podcast history here

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
see though they're stuck together

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
they almost look like they're not but they are

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
you guys are never going to speak to me again

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
we're going to be your best friend

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
and instagram the hell out of your foot

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
what's it called?

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
and I'll make sure the mutants don't take you over

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
syndactylism?

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
syndactyl

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
that's amazing

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
we're going to get a picture of that on the bus

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
alright well that

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
how many people in America

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
do you reckon have

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
all of them

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
is there a statistic on how many people

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
have syndactylism?

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
three out of three

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
crittenden siblings have this

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
all of your siblings have it?

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
yeah but no one else in like any overextended family

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
that's so weird

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
yeah I had a girlfriend that had it too

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
but like those are the only four people I've ever known to have this

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
wait you had a girlfriend

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
you had a girlfriend with fused toes too?

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
yeah

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
did you meet at a fused toe convention?

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
it was a support group

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
no you're kidding

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
yeah no I'm kidding

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
how much of it was kidding?

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
did you have a girlfriend that had it?

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
it happened yeah

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
well that must have blown your mind

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
it did

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
what happened to her?

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
she's fucking a 75 year old guy

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
wait

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
what? how old is she?

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
let's save this for this feels terrible

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
no she's 22

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
22? she's fucking a 75 year old guy?

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
yeah that's older than her dad

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
I'm not bitter at all

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
sorry it's a lot to take in

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
it's a lot for me to take in

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
how fresh is that wound?

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
how long ago did you break up?

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
I mean it's fresher than it ought to be

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
that wasn't explanatory at all

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
no I gotcha

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
I found out in April

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
and uh

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
she left you for a 75 year old guy

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
that's allowed to be fresh

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
and that's why I have no self esteem

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
alright

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
I feel a lot better now

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
about

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
thank you Spencer

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
I love Spencer

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
I feel worse now

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
I don't know

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
I can't help you

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
every man for himself

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
I'm leaving

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
Spencer everybody

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
God bless you Spencer

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
amazing

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
his toes are fused together

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
in Los Angeles he just raised

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
I said is there a dungeon master in the audience

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
he raised his hand

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
he's now on a bus with us

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
his toes are fused together

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
I don't know where to go

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
what's happening

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
where do we go to

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
it started with the toe thing

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
we got 19 cities to go

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
do you feel like you've learned anything

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
we're going to learn that he's God

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
it's going to be like one

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
by the end of the tour

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
it's going to be like the seventh seal

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
we're going to find out

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
that we are all in his

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
Dungeons and Dragons game

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
I think that's very reasonable

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
I think

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
I think the prediction is that

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
the movie ends up being mostly about Spencer

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
it's certainly the most interesting

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
of all of us

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
the movie's not even made yet

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
because you're narcissistic

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
I'm just vain

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
Spencer is noble in some way

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
that we're yet to find out

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
if these guys wanted to watch a movie

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
of a guy who comes out on stage

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
and goes should I be on stage

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
they could watch it about themselves

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
Spencer is an amazing

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
he's incredible I hate him

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
I'm going to poison his food

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
no I love him

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
he's incredible

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
did you have a question Tyler Dandy

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
oh

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
do you have a statement

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
do you have a question

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
oh sure yeah yeah

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
he said will you please tell us what you knew

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
I'm working on two of them

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
on the tour bus

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
I'm doing a

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
you know it's multi-camera

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
which means that there's a laugh track

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
probably well I shouldn't say a laugh track

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
before a live studio audience

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
what's the premise can you say

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
it's a father-daughter relationship

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
what's that

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
better than that

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
I was just going to say

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
the trouble is

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
I worked on community for three years

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
and the whole time every day I got up out of bed

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
I was doing

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
I was going to work for people

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
who

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
wanted me to

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
by doing the thing that I wanted to do

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
I was trying to make people happy

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
I was being the bad guy

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
and my attempt

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
now is to try to

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
segment things into

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
I want to do a thing for CBS and a thing for Fox

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
and a thing for Adult Swim at the same time

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
so the thing for Adult Swim is like

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
it's about a scientist with a diarrhea ray

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
you know it's like crazy shit that

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
the 15 year old in you will love it

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
it's being written right now

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
it's an incredible show

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
nobody will see it it's Adult Swim

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
but if you'll watch it and you'll love it

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
it's a cartoon

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
then at Fox I want to do

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
something that's like the new community

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
do something that's single camera

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
and makes people happy

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
and

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
and then at CBS

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
I also want to prove

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
not in a cynical way I want to prove

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
that something can be successful and good

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
like it may not be

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
your cup of tea Tyler Dandy

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
I'm basing that purely

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
in the fact that you shouted out you can do better

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
than that Dan Harmon

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
I hear you I hear you

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
I understand where that's coming from

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
I know we've been indoctrinated into a culture of

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
okay popular shit sucks

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
and smart shit is not popular

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
and I don't

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
I'm not disagreeing with you

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
I understand your anxieties

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
but I really

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
I have your permission Tyler Dandy

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
to

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
try as hard as I can to make a good

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
like old

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
Tyler get up here

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
if I take Tyler Dandy everybody

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
I can't see him

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
I'm not leaving her without looking

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
Tyler Dandy in the eye

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
Tyler Dandy

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
it's Andy Dick

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
you get it all the time

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
oh fuck

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
I'm intrigued here

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
it's interesting you're calling out from the audience

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
you're not a heckler

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
you're not like a drunk raucous look at me guy

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
you're saying I love you

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
you're the voice in the back of my head

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
I used your story circle to write my short stories

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
I love you

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
you're my hero

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
I'm nothing without you

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
well what do you

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
what do you envision me doing

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
like if I can do better than writing a CVS

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
what do you

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
what do you envision me doing that would like

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
like you would go that's fucking Dan Harmon

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
he did it

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
if you could make multi-camera work

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
that's amazing

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
alright we'll see yeah that's why I want to try

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
yeah you're no like

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
I'm with fated breath

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
for what you're gonna do next

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
I'm sorry

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
season 2 of community is the best thing I've seen on tv

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
in my entire goddamn life

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
I liked it

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
you're a genius

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
Adderall and all I don't give a fuck

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
you're a genius

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
I should have taken some Adderall tonight

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
Dan there's times

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
I'm gonna redeem myself

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
it's not a time to talk sometimes the soul opens up

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
and you must sing

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
or rap

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
do you remember the refrain bringing it

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
you know

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
it's been a show

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
it's been kinda weird

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
I'm sorry about it sorry about my beard

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
collecting all the food

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
and all the tears from the regrets

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
and dreams that I ever had before

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
came to Phoenix looking for

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
something new

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
all I did I feel is disappoint you

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
but you disagree

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
you say you love me but

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
