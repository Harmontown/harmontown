{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:18.000\nPhoenix, Arizona. Stand up live. How are you guys doing tonight?\n\n00:18.000 --> 00:27.000\nWell I have some bloody good news for you. Harmontown is in session in Arizona.\n\n00:27.000 --> 00:36.000\nWon't you please help me in welcoming the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.\n\n00:36.000 --> 00:45.000\nYo, yo, yo, yo, yo Phoenix, yo Phoenix, yo Phoenix, yo Phoenix. Best city in the goddamn world.\n\n00:45.000 --> 00:52.000\nWhat's in his ear? What's in his ear? There's a weird thing in my ear. Don't be distracted.\n\n00:52.000 --> 01:02.000\nIt's a camera. I'm looking at you. I'm taping for you for your movie. You're gonna be in my movie.\n\n01:02.000 --> 01:15.000\nMind games being played with you. Thought you were watching me. I'm watching you making movies about an audience.\n\n01:15.000 --> 01:29.000\nPhoenix. We have so much to talk about and barely any time to do it. Thank you for waiting if you were waiting.\n\n01:29.000 --> 01:39.000\nI heard you broke the ice with, he told you, it's just your ponytail. We wanted to know who you were so bad.\n\n01:39.000 --> 01:48.000\nWhat's your name? Ham? You're happy? You're happy to be here? Okay. If you said no, it would take us down a whole different road.\n\n01:48.000 --> 01:53.000\nIn the future, if you guys are regular here and you come to the show again and you sit in that seat,\n\n01:53.000 --> 01:59.000\njust know that the people backstage get to look at the side of your head for the entire, just one, really one share.\n\n01:59.000 --> 02:04.000\nLike the top of your head, just like the top third of your head, depending on your confidence.\n\n02:04.000 --> 02:09.000\nEvery time you get a little happy, you're like whack-a-mole.\n\n02:09.000 --> 02:15.000\nWe could see his, with the top of his hat right there, we couldn't tell if he was a ninja because all we could see was the back of the hat.\n\n02:15.000 --> 02:23.000\nMy back was dreadlocks. I thought there'd be dreadlocks under there, but it's not. You're clearly just a regular non-Jamaican meth dealer.\n\n02:23.000 --> 02:29.000\nJust a surfer type, right? You guys are probably sick of meth jokes. I'm sure everybody that comes through goes like,\n\n02:29.000 --> 02:35.000\nhey, it's a meth. I'm from Wisconsin. It was cheese. You guys make meth.\n\n02:35.000 --> 02:42.000\nWhat do you wear on top of your heads at the football games? Like a glass?\n\n02:42.000 --> 02:48.000\nNow I'm doing it. Now I'm doing it. I'm doing what everyone does when they come through here, I'm sure.\n\n02:48.000 --> 02:53.000\nIt's the Southwest. It's the best region of the country.\n\n02:53.000 --> 02:59.000\nIt's Phoenix. It's the greatest. It's the sixth largest capital city in the United States.\n\n02:59.000 --> 03:05.000\nYour mayor's name is Greg Stanton.\n\n03:05.000 --> 03:09.000\nYour football team is the Sun Sanders.\n\n03:09.000 --> 03:11.000\nFuck.\n\n03:11.000 --> 03:13.000\nSpent all day in the hotel room.\n\n03:13.000 --> 03:15.000\nThe Sun Sanders.\n\n03:15.000 --> 03:20.000\nYou love cacti. You're proud of it.\n\n03:20.000 --> 03:26.000\nSo much to talk about. So we're making the movie. That's why I came out with the Bluetooth.\n\n03:26.000 --> 03:32.000\nWe just went everywhere we go. We're making this. We got in the tour bus. You're our first stop, by the way.\n\n03:32.000 --> 03:38.000\nI talked to people at the bar. They didn't even know that. I make the mistake.\n\n03:38.000 --> 03:42.000\nI think that's a narcissist mistake. You think that everyone knows what you know.\n\n03:42.000 --> 03:47.000\nSo first of all, that adds to nervousness. I think you know that I'm an asshole. I think you know I'm stupid.\n\n03:47.000 --> 03:52.000\nI think you know I'm not funny. And I also think you know that this is our first stop on the tour.\n\n03:52.000 --> 03:55.000\nBut obviously, we have to get to know each other.\n\n03:55.000 --> 04:00.000\nWe have been doing this show in a cradle in Los Angeles. It's a very specific audience.\n\n04:00.000 --> 04:06.000\nYou guys are a specific audience. We have to spend tonight making a kind of love.\n\n04:06.000 --> 04:13.000\nIt will be consensual. We're going to leave here with your money having been well spent.\n\n04:13.000 --> 04:22.000\nOr I will literally kill myself on stage. And you can Instagram it and use the right filter.\n\n04:22.000 --> 04:27.000\nBecause I think I feel like my blood looks fat this week.\n\n04:27.000 --> 04:33.000\nAlso, for those of you that listen to the podcast, I don't know if you've listened to the last one,\n\n04:33.000 --> 04:38.000\nbut Pat and Oswald gave Phoenix some pretty rough treatments.\n\n04:38.000 --> 04:45.000\nDid anyone hear that? We'll start to get to know each other.\n\n04:45.000 --> 04:53.000\nWho listens to the podcast regularly?\n\n04:53.000 --> 04:57.000\nThat's like 60% there.\n\n04:57.000 --> 05:04.000\nWho just got a flyer saying, you won a comedy contest. Come see some funny stand-up.\n\n05:04.000 --> 05:10.000\nOkay, thank God. That was my big nightmare. It was like, hey, let's go see some comedy.\n\n05:10.000 --> 05:18.000\nAnd then I come out and I'm like, I feel fat. This isn't Horatio Sands.\n\n05:18.000 --> 05:20.000\nWho's fat?\n\n05:20.000 --> 05:23.000\nWell, he's lost a lot of weight. He looks good.\n\n05:23.000 --> 05:30.000\nI'm just saying, these posters on the wall, the people here tonight who came for that,\n\n05:30.000 --> 05:35.000\nyou're also going to get your money's worth. I swear to God. I swear to your God.\n\n05:35.000 --> 05:41.000\nI'm not even mine. Mine's more easy going than yours. I will do whatever your God requires.\n\n05:41.000 --> 05:48.000\nYou're not leaving here until your money has been well spent. How much were the tickets?\n\n05:48.000 --> 05:50.000\nTwenty-two.\n\n05:50.000 --> 05:51.000\nOkay, I take it back.\n\n05:51.000 --> 05:53.000\nThat's rough.\n\n05:53.000 --> 05:56.000\nThat's a tall order for a guy like me.\n\n05:56.000 --> 05:59.000\nTwenty-two. That's an arbitrarily non-round number.\n\n05:59.000 --> 06:04.000\nI've never done a $22 show. This will be my first one.\n\n06:04.000 --> 06:05.000\nOkay, fine.\n\n06:05.000 --> 06:09.000\nTonight, Dan, let's give him a $23 show.\n\n06:09.000 --> 06:14.000\nThis will help the $20. I was like pandering to your...\n\n06:14.000 --> 06:18.000\nWhat Dan is doing for the podcast is he's taking off, he's unbuttoning his shirt.\n\n06:18.000 --> 06:28.000\nIt's not an Arizona state shirt. It's the Alice Cooper, Cooper's town, knockoff of the Sun Devil's shirt.\n\n06:28.000 --> 06:35.000\nSo we have Wildcat fans who are also like big Ted Nugent fans as well.\n\n06:35.000 --> 06:38.000\nWait, are you guys mad at Sun Devil's or Alice Cooper?\n\n06:38.000 --> 06:40.000\nBoth.\n\n06:40.000 --> 06:47.000\nBut what about... Didn't you just tell me that Ted Nugent compared gun owners to Rosa Parks today?\n\n06:47.000 --> 06:49.000\nYeah, I just read that.\n\n06:49.000 --> 06:53.000\nTed Nugent made the brave, odd choice.\n\n06:53.000 --> 06:59.000\nHe said... I just saw it like in a little blurb. Apparently he said that gun owners compared them to Rosa Parks\n\n06:59.000 --> 07:05.000\nand that one day the law-abiding gun owner will be sitting in the front of the bus.\n\n07:05.000 --> 07:09.000\nWhatever that bus is. I'm assuming it's a bus to go rob a bank.\n\n07:09.000 --> 07:14.000\nSounds like the bus is shooting people. I don't know how that metaphor is supposed to be explored.\n\n07:14.000 --> 07:22.000\nWe're sitting in the back of it now, which means we're not shooting people with the guns that we're heroes for having.\n\n07:22.000 --> 07:28.000\nI don't turn to Ted Nugent for my metaphors. I don't think of him as somebody...\n\n07:28.000 --> 07:32.000\nI don't know why we've begun turning to him for our politics. It's the weirdest.\n\n07:32.000 --> 07:36.000\nI trust him for one topic alone, bow hunting. That's it.\n\n07:36.000 --> 07:37.000\nBow hunting?\n\n07:37.000 --> 07:45.000\nTed Nugent knows everything about bow hunting. If he came up here and was like, this is how you notch an arrow, I believe you.\n\n07:45.000 --> 07:53.000\nI would go to him not for civil rights analogies. I would go to him more if I had questions about Wang Dang, Sweet Poon Tang.\n\n07:53.000 --> 07:56.000\nThat's when I would turn to Ted Nugent.\n\n07:56.000 --> 08:01.000\nHoly shit! What a great city! Phoenix is amazing!\n\n08:01.000 --> 08:07.000\nYou're already starting to sense that I'm forcing that.\n\n08:07.000 --> 08:12.000\nI would say I really mean it, but I can't yet.\n\n08:12.000 --> 08:13.000\nYou were nervous about tonight?\n\n08:13.000 --> 08:19.000\nWell, yeah, because we left our comfort zone. We drove in a bus and then we came out the door and we came in here.\n\n08:19.000 --> 08:29.000\nAnd I saw the lacquered tables and the three-foot high stage and the posters of people who clearly you can tell from the photos on the wall,\n\n08:29.000 --> 08:34.000\nthe people who normally perform here, they have actual material.\n\n08:34.000 --> 08:39.000\nThey're doing it in the picture. There's a picture of a lady going like, ah!\n\n08:39.000 --> 08:46.000\nShe's in the middle, she's just finishing explaining what Jack Nicholson would be like in a drive-thru.\n\n08:46.000 --> 08:55.000\nThat guy just finally drew the line between men and women in the shopping with the toilet.\n\n08:55.000 --> 09:00.000\nThis is like a hall of fame back there.\n\n09:00.000 --> 09:03.000\nSee, most comics come up and riff the sets.\n\n09:03.000 --> 09:09.000\nA hat comic would come up and go, oh, wow, nice to be back in Preskets.\n\n09:09.000 --> 09:13.000\nBut you're actually riffing the other comics that are on the wall here.\n\n09:13.000 --> 09:14.000\nYou're riffing on comics.\n\n09:14.000 --> 09:17.000\nI'm not riffing. I'm intimidated by them. They look like the...\n\n09:17.000 --> 09:20.000\nI can't tell anyone. Is that Gallagher or a woman? I can't see who that is.\n\n09:20.000 --> 09:24.000\nIt looks like Rachel Dratch or like an emo...\n\n09:24.000 --> 09:27.000\nOh, it's Bobby Lee.\n\n09:27.000 --> 09:28.000\nThat's Bobby Lee.\n\n09:28.000 --> 09:32.000\nBobby Lee, if you're listening, I thought you were Rachel Dratch.\n\n09:32.000 --> 09:36.000\nAnd Bobby Lee, I thought you were Gallagher, so...\n\n09:36.000 --> 09:41.000\nAnd everyone else on the wall here, take it easy on the appetizers.\n\n09:41.000 --> 09:44.000\nThat's mean. Look at me. Look at me.\n\n09:44.000 --> 09:47.000\nThere is a thing... I was looking through the menu.\n\n09:47.000 --> 09:50.000\nThere's a thing on the menu that just says pig.\n\n09:50.000 --> 09:52.000\nAnd it boasts that it's...\n\n09:52.000 --> 09:56.000\nSomebody grab a menu and read the pig for me on the microphone.\n\n09:56.000 --> 09:59.000\nIs there a menu out there?\n\n09:59.000 --> 10:03.000\nA half pound of bacon with a side of maple syrup.\n\n10:03.000 --> 10:05.000\nThat's fucking fantastic.\n\n10:05.000 --> 10:06.000\nHe said a pound.\n\n10:06.000 --> 10:08.000\nIt's a half pound.\n\n10:08.000 --> 10:10.000\nTake it easy.\n\n10:10.000 --> 10:13.000\nWhat do you think this is? Ladies' night?\n\n10:13.000 --> 10:15.000\nI don't know what that means.\n\n10:15.000 --> 10:18.000\nAre you saying women are pigs, Dan? Is that what that was?\n\n10:18.000 --> 10:19.000\nI don't know what it means.\n\n10:19.000 --> 10:22.000\nI will say things. I don't know what they mean.\n\n10:22.000 --> 10:24.000\nI just hope it makes you laugh.\n\n10:24.000 --> 10:26.000\nIt's a trick people can perform.\n\n10:26.000 --> 10:31.000\nIt's kind of like a Rubik's Cube and a Monica Lewinsky cigar.\n\n10:31.000 --> 10:33.000\nNo, it didn't work. Okay, good.\n\n10:33.000 --> 10:36.000\nDon't ever let me fool you.\n\n10:36.000 --> 10:37.000\nRap! Rap!\n\n10:37.000 --> 10:39.000\nOh, shit. You want to rap?\n\n10:39.000 --> 10:42.000\nSee, now Dan... I don't know if you guys are familiar with this.\n\n10:42.000 --> 10:45.000\nDan likes to rap.\n\n10:45.000 --> 10:50.000\nThe raps usually involve him fucking one of your mothers.\n\n10:50.000 --> 10:51.000\nWe have a...\n\n10:51.000 --> 10:55.000\nWho wants me to rap about fucking their mom?\n\n10:55.000 --> 10:58.000\nAll right, I've got a lot of hands. I love Phoenix.\n\n10:58.000 --> 11:00.000\nYou're on?\n\n11:00.000 --> 11:03.000\nWait, this guy wants you to fuck his aunt.\n\n11:03.000 --> 11:04.000\nFuck his house?\n\n11:04.000 --> 11:06.000\nHis aunt.\n\n11:06.000 --> 11:07.000\nAll right, all right.\n\n11:07.000 --> 11:09.000\nYou want Dan Harmon to rap about fucking your aunt?\n\n11:09.000 --> 11:11.000\nOne of those.\n\n11:11.000 --> 11:12.000\nAll right.\n\n11:12.000 --> 11:14.000\nAll right. Well, shit, I'm torn.\n\n11:14.000 --> 11:18.000\nNow, Dan, we have a lot of different rap styles here we can use here.\n\n11:18.000 --> 11:21.000\nWe have sexy and slow freestyle.\n\n11:21.000 --> 11:26.000\nI want to do a sexy, slow rap about fucking his aunt.\n\n11:26.000 --> 11:28.000\nWho is a sister of his mama?\n\n11:28.000 --> 11:30.000\nMaybe you can tie that in.\n\n11:30.000 --> 11:31.000\nYou're already burning up my rhyme.\n\n11:31.000 --> 11:33.000\nSorry.\n\n11:33.000 --> 11:35.000\nWait, what's your name, sir?\n\n11:35.000 --> 11:36.000\nAlex?\n\n11:36.000 --> 11:38.000\nOkay, what's your aunt's name?\n\n11:38.000 --> 11:39.000\nPatty?\n\n11:39.000 --> 11:42.000\nAnd what is she the most afraid of?\n\n11:42.000 --> 11:43.000\nAging?\n\n11:43.000 --> 11:46.000\nHow old is she?\n\n11:46.000 --> 11:48.000\nI forgot her name already.\n\n11:48.000 --> 11:49.000\nPatty.\n\n11:49.000 --> 11:51.000\nI'm not good at this.\n\n11:51.000 --> 11:53.000\nI'm not good at this.\n\n11:53.000 --> 11:55.000\nI'm good at fucking your mama.\n\n11:55.000 --> 12:01.000\nI fuck, oh, shit.\n\n12:01.000 --> 12:02.000\nSorry.\n\n12:02.000 --> 12:04.000\nMaybe that's how you met his aunt.\n\n12:04.000 --> 12:06.000\nRight.\n\n12:06.000 --> 12:11.000\nYo, yo, yo, yo, yo.\n\n12:11.000 --> 12:13.000\nAlex came over, wanted to talk to me.\n\n12:13.000 --> 12:15.000\nI said, can I fuck your mama?\n\n12:15.000 --> 12:17.000\nHe said, let's wait and see.\n\n12:17.000 --> 12:20.000\nHe brought me down the hall into a different room.\n\n12:20.000 --> 12:25.000\nHe said, the pussy you're going to fuck is not connected to womb.\n\n12:25.000 --> 12:30.000\nYes, it is, but not the one that gave birth to me.\n\n12:30.000 --> 12:33.000\nHe introduced me to a different person.\n\n12:33.000 --> 12:36.000\nI was, my eyes were bursting.\n\n12:36.000 --> 12:38.000\nI took this bitch in.\n\n12:38.000 --> 12:39.000\nI said, who are you?\n\n12:39.000 --> 12:42.000\nShe said, my name is Patty and I want to fuck you.\n\n12:42.000 --> 12:44.000\nI said, oh, shit.\n\n12:44.000 --> 12:49.000\nAlex's aunt, I want to fuck her out of her pant.\n\n12:49.000 --> 12:52.000\nShe had one pant, not a pair.\n\n12:52.000 --> 12:54.000\nI fucked his aunt.\n\n12:54.000 --> 12:57.000\nYou didn't care, but check it out.\n\n12:57.000 --> 13:00.000\nI turned her over and said, holy shit.\n\n13:00.000 --> 13:04.000\nPhoenix is a great city.\n\n13:04.000 --> 13:05.000\nIt's hard.\n\n13:05.000 --> 13:07.000\nI can't, I can't fucking ant.\n\n13:07.000 --> 13:08.000\nIt's hard.\n\n13:08.000 --> 13:09.000\nIt's too hard.\n\n13:09.000 --> 13:11.000\nDo you want to fuck somebody's mama instead?\n\n13:11.000 --> 13:13.000\nYeah, let's fuck this guy's mama.\n\n13:13.000 --> 13:14.000\nAll right.\n\n13:14.000 --> 13:16.000\nWhat's your name, sir?\n\n13:16.000 --> 13:17.000\nDustin.\n\n13:17.000 --> 13:18.000\nDustin?\n\n13:18.000 --> 13:20.000\nYou would like Dan Harmon to fuck your mama right now.\n\n13:20.000 --> 13:22.000\nOkay, what's your favorite food?\n\n13:22.000 --> 13:23.000\nSteak.\n\n13:23.000 --> 13:24.000\nOkay, steak.\n\n13:24.000 --> 13:27.000\nAll right.\n\n13:27.000 --> 13:29.000\nWhich movie did you think was better?\n\n13:29.000 --> 13:33.000\nTremors or Shawshank Redemption?\n\n13:33.000 --> 13:34.000\nShawshank Redemption.\n\n13:34.000 --> 13:35.000\nOkay, he likes steak.\n\n13:35.000 --> 13:36.000\nWhat was his name?\n\n13:36.000 --> 13:37.000\nDustin.\n\n13:37.000 --> 13:38.000\nDustin.\n\n13:38.000 --> 13:39.000\nDustin.\n\n13:39.000 --> 13:40.000\nOkay.\n\n13:40.000 --> 13:41.000\nAll right, Dustin.\n\n13:41.000 --> 13:43.000\nThis is Shawshank Redemption and steak.\n\n13:43.000 --> 13:44.000\nAnd I fucked his mama.\n\n13:44.000 --> 13:48.000\nGive me a beat.\n\n13:48.000 --> 13:54.000\nLadies and gentlemen, Dustin's mama has been fucked\n\n13:54.000 --> 13:57.000\nat least once that we know of.\n\n13:57.000 --> 14:06.000\nBut she's about to get it again.\n\n14:06.000 --> 14:14.000\nOh, I'm everywhere.\n\n14:14.000 --> 14:15.000\nBreakdown.\n\n14:15.000 --> 14:16.000\nFour in the afternoon.\n\n14:16.000 --> 14:22.000\nFuck Dustin's mama all the way into...\n\n14:22.000 --> 14:23.000\nThe moon.\n\n14:23.000 --> 14:24.000\nRetake.\n\n14:24.000 --> 14:25.000\nRetake.\n\n14:25.000 --> 14:26.000\nDan, Dan, Dan, Dan.\n\n14:26.000 --> 14:27.000\nThat was my fault.\n\n14:27.000 --> 14:30.000\nI meant to give you this one.\n\n14:30.000 --> 14:35.000\nAll right, this one's...\n\n14:35.000 --> 14:36.000\nYeah.\n\n14:36.000 --> 14:44.000\nAnd what if I fucked Dustin's mama tonight?\n\n14:44.000 --> 14:50.000\nDustin's mama, does he taste like steak?\n\n14:50.000 --> 14:58.000\nIt's ironic, because her son loves it, and so do I.\n\n14:58.000 --> 15:04.000\nThe weird thing is, if I was next to him, which I would never want to be very uncomfortable,\n\n15:04.000 --> 15:11.000\ngiven the naked company, I'd look over to him and say, this is steak.\n\n15:11.000 --> 15:15.000\nAnd he'd say, that's my favorite food.\n\n15:15.000 --> 15:19.000\nBut you're talking about my mama's pussy.\n\n15:19.000 --> 15:28.000\nAt that point, it'd sink in what I'd done, and I'd be like, sorry, so sorry.\n\n15:28.000 --> 15:33.000\nI've gone too far, Dustin.\n\n15:33.000 --> 15:36.000\nLet's go watch Shawshank Redemption.\n\n15:36.000 --> 15:41.000\nI thought it was pretty masterful how I used suggestions to create a...\n\n15:41.000 --> 15:42.000\nYeah, yeah.\n\n15:42.000 --> 15:44.000\nYou didn't know how those were going to come in.\n\n15:44.000 --> 15:45.000\nThat was experimental.\n\n15:45.000 --> 15:49.000\nAll right, let's stop with the gimmicks.\n\n15:49.000 --> 15:53.000\nWhat am I performing monkey?\n\n15:53.000 --> 15:56.000\nWhat am I someone you paid $22 to see?\n\n15:56.000 --> 15:59.000\nWe have to get a couple things out of the way just for the movie.\n\n15:59.000 --> 16:02.000\nI'll take it off of your $22 if you see me after you go.\n\n16:02.000 --> 16:04.000\nI helped you with the movie.\n\n16:04.000 --> 16:08.000\nI want my $3 because we've got to get a couple of...\n\n16:08.000 --> 16:11.000\nBecause we're making this movie, it's like a tour movie.\n\n16:11.000 --> 16:21.000\nOne thing I can think that we definitely need is the slow-motion montage of me killing it at every venue.\n\n16:21.000 --> 16:27.000\nWe definitely have to fake that because it's not going to happen.\n\n16:27.000 --> 16:33.000\nBecause I don't have Bobby Lee's chutzpah.\n\n16:33.000 --> 16:37.000\nThe horrible song about Dustin's mom, I'm so sorry.\n\n16:37.000 --> 16:39.000\nI don't know what I thought I was doing.\n\n16:39.000 --> 16:43.000\nIt didn't rhyme and it was gross and it evoked an image of...\n\n16:43.000 --> 16:45.000\nThis is gross.\n\n16:45.000 --> 16:48.000\nI lost a lot of the women too and I'm sorry.\n\n16:48.000 --> 16:50.000\nYou want to try a country song instead?\n\n16:50.000 --> 16:52.000\nMaybe in a second.\n\n16:52.000 --> 16:56.000\nWe don't want to burn up all the gold.\n\n16:56.000 --> 17:00.000\nWe're safe so far.\n\n17:00.000 --> 17:03.000\nLet's just get a quick...\n\n17:03.000 --> 17:06.000\nI just want to get a shot of...\n\n17:06.000 --> 17:11.000\nIt's slow-motion so I don't know if there's cameras that can overcrank.\n\n17:11.000 --> 17:14.000\nI need you guys to be slow-mo.\n\n17:14.000 --> 17:18.000\nIf you can just imagine that I did well.\n\n17:18.000 --> 17:21.000\nThis sounds like the most dishonest thing in the world.\n\n17:21.000 --> 17:26.000\nDan, Harmontown is about being sincere and honest connections with people.\n\n17:26.000 --> 17:29.000\nIt's basically a real thing.\n\n17:29.000 --> 17:32.000\nJust imagine that it's the end of the show.\n\n17:32.000 --> 17:37.000\nI did really good and kind of like slow-mo reach for me.\n\n17:37.000 --> 17:39.000\nYou wish you could touch me.\n\n17:39.000 --> 17:42.000\nAnd then I'll be kind of like touching you.\n\n17:42.000 --> 17:46.000\nBut first I want to get the Bon Jovi Sweep.\n\n17:46.000 --> 17:51.000\nSo you guys can just kind of raise up like one, two, three, do it.\n\n17:51.000 --> 17:53.000\nLike slow-mo.\n\n17:53.000 --> 17:55.000\nWait, wait, wait.\n\n18:03.000 --> 18:05.000\nThis is all a lie.\n\n18:05.000 --> 18:16.000\nWhat kind of movie do you think you're making?\n\n18:16.000 --> 18:19.000\nMovie of lies.\n\n18:22.000 --> 18:24.000\nI won't sign off on this, Dan.\n\n18:24.000 --> 18:26.000\nThis is the...\n\n18:26.000 --> 18:29.000\nAlright, well, whatever.\n\n18:29.000 --> 18:32.000\nAlright, well, can we also...\n\n18:32.000 --> 18:36.000\nWell, give yourselves a hand.\n\n18:36.000 --> 18:38.000\nWell, can we...\n\n18:38.000 --> 18:40.000\nWe'll counteract it then.\n\n18:40.000 --> 18:44.000\nI say now, Dan, now because of that dishonesty,\n\n18:44.000 --> 18:49.000\nnow it's your... the onus is on you to create that moment for real by the end of this show.\n\n18:49.000 --> 18:51.000\nI will definitely will.\n\n18:51.000 --> 18:53.000\nI basically already did.\n\n18:53.000 --> 18:56.000\nWith community.\n\n18:56.000 --> 19:01.000\nSee?\n\n19:01.000 --> 19:06.000\nBut when I don't have Joel McHale again on camera,\n\n19:06.000 --> 19:08.000\nI have to juice it a little bit.\n\n19:08.000 --> 19:11.000\nThere's everything, everything in entertainment is a lie.\n\n19:11.000 --> 19:13.000\nOkay, well, here, I'll do you this favor.\n\n19:13.000 --> 19:15.000\nLet's do the opposite.\n\n19:15.000 --> 19:17.000\nLike let's do the dark moment.\n\n19:17.000 --> 19:20.000\nWe don't know, this might be the worst gig of the whole tour.\n\n19:20.000 --> 19:22.000\nSo does anybody have...\n\n19:22.000 --> 19:24.000\nDo you have stuff you could throw at me?\n\n19:24.000 --> 19:26.000\nWithout hurting me?\n\n19:26.000 --> 19:30.000\nA lot of people are very readily picked up bottles.\n\n19:30.000 --> 19:32.000\nBut nothing glass, nothing...\n\n19:32.000 --> 19:34.000\nYeah, plastic.\n\n19:34.000 --> 19:35.000\nOkay, that was...\n\n19:35.000 --> 19:37.000\nThat looked like a roll of like sweet tarts.\n\n19:37.000 --> 19:40.000\nWell, don't, don't, don't wait, don't start.\n\n19:40.000 --> 19:43.000\nThere has to be control.\n\n19:43.000 --> 19:45.000\nYou can't just...\n\n19:45.000 --> 19:49.000\nLike, like, like I cue you and then we go because we have to get a good shot.\n\n19:49.000 --> 19:52.000\nSo, alright, so just...\n\n19:52.000 --> 19:55.000\nOkay, so I'm going to cower because I kind of like...\n\n19:55.000 --> 19:59.000\nI reached too hard and you turned on me.\n\n19:59.000 --> 20:02.000\nAnd just kind of like, just kind of boomy.\n\n20:02.000 --> 20:04.000\nAnd if you don't have anything to throw,\n\n20:04.000 --> 20:11.000\njust kind of like point angrily or go like this, like forget this.\n\n20:11.000 --> 20:15.000\nSo, alright, so I'll just cue you with like a generic thing.\n\n20:15.000 --> 20:20.000\nSo you'll receive the cue, I'll cue you naturally.\n\n20:20.000 --> 20:23.000\nLike, this has been the greatest chewer ever.\n\n20:23.000 --> 20:27.000\nThis thing's been better than 9-11, which I loved happening.\n\n20:27.000 --> 20:28.000\nI loved it.\n\n20:28.000 --> 20:30.000\nI loved it.\n\n20:30.000 --> 20:32.000\nWhat are you talking about, you dumb shit?\n\n20:32.000 --> 20:33.000\nNo!\n\n20:33.000 --> 20:35.000\nYou don't know what you're talking about!\n\n20:35.000 --> 20:36.000\nFuck you!\n\n20:36.000 --> 20:39.000\nI'm going back to Los Angeles!\n\n20:39.000 --> 20:41.000\nYou're such a bitch!\n\n20:41.000 --> 20:42.000\nAlright, there you happy?\n\n20:42.000 --> 20:43.000\nThat was good.\n\n20:43.000 --> 20:44.000\nYou guys are wrapped.\n\n20:44.000 --> 20:45.000\nThank you very much.\n\n20:45.000 --> 20:52.000\nIt's exhilarating to be part of Hollywood, isn't it?\n\n20:52.000 --> 20:53.000\nLike, show business.\n\n20:53.000 --> 20:54.000\nProbably.\n\n20:54.000 --> 20:56.000\nIt's a lot of...\n\n20:56.000 --> 20:58.000\nIt's a very nice crowd.\n\n20:58.000 --> 21:00.000\nThere's a lot of soft stuff.\n\n21:00.000 --> 21:05.000\nYou'd expect one guy and there would be like a weird ninja star.\n\n21:05.000 --> 21:09.000\nAlright, so Phoenix, let's get back to getting to know you.\n\n21:09.000 --> 21:15.000\nWe can't leave this town as we go on this tour.\n\n21:15.000 --> 21:18.000\nWe want to come away with learning something about this town.\n\n21:18.000 --> 21:21.000\nI've been to Phoenix a couple of times and it's always been very quick,\n\n21:21.000 --> 21:22.000\nso I don't really know much about it.\n\n21:22.000 --> 21:24.000\nSo we have to, you know, we have tonight.\n\n21:24.000 --> 21:26.000\nI know incredibly little about Phoenix.\n\n21:26.000 --> 21:32.000\nLike, maybe we could solicit somebody to help learning about it.\n\n21:32.000 --> 21:34.000\nWho feels like they know...\n\n21:34.000 --> 21:37.000\nWho's lived here their whole life?\n\n21:37.000 --> 21:40.000\nWho's lived here their whole life?\n\n21:40.000 --> 21:42.000\nOkay, we got a couple hands.\n\n21:42.000 --> 21:43.000\nYou got hair right here?\n\n21:43.000 --> 21:45.000\nPam's friend.\n\n21:45.000 --> 21:48.000\nNo, sitting across from Pam.\n\n21:48.000 --> 21:52.000\nYou're both named Breanne?\n\n21:52.000 --> 21:55.000\nThat's fine, doesn't it?\n\n21:55.000 --> 21:58.000\nYou're both named Breanne?\n\n21:58.000 --> 22:01.000\nIt's weird for me.\n\n22:01.000 --> 22:03.000\nHave you met before tonight?\n\n22:03.000 --> 22:05.000\nYou just met and you're both named Breanne.\n\n22:05.000 --> 22:06.000\nThat's awesome.\n\n22:06.000 --> 22:11.000\nYou guys are going to...\n\n22:11.000 --> 22:14.000\nOkay.\n\n22:14.000 --> 22:15.000\nAll right.\n\n22:15.000 --> 22:17.000\nWe've made a love connection over here.\n\n22:17.000 --> 22:18.000\nAll right.\n\n22:18.000 --> 22:20.000\nBreanne, would you be willing to come up and talk to us for just a second?\n\n22:20.000 --> 22:22.000\nWe don't bully people at Harmontown.\n\n22:22.000 --> 22:24.000\nWe're not going to make fun of you.\n\n22:24.000 --> 22:27.000\nLet's welcome Breanne at the stage, everybody.\n\n22:27.000 --> 22:33.000\nWell, you're both Breanne.\n\n22:33.000 --> 22:38.000\nAll right, Breanne.\n\n22:38.000 --> 22:41.000\nI have no idea what we're doing with them.\n\n22:41.000 --> 22:49.000\nI know.\n\n22:49.000 --> 22:53.000\nI will have you.\n\n22:53.000 --> 22:55.000\nI would like to learn more about Phoenix.\n\n22:55.000 --> 22:58.000\nSo, both of you lived in Phoenix your whole lives?\n\n22:58.000 --> 22:59.000\nYes.\n\n22:59.000 --> 23:02.000\nOkay.\n\n23:02.000 --> 23:04.000\nBut you just met tonight.\n\n23:04.000 --> 23:06.000\nIt's so weird.\n\n23:06.000 --> 23:07.000\nAll right.\n\n23:07.000 --> 23:12.000\nSo, what's the worst thing about Phoenix?\n\n23:12.000 --> 23:14.000\nSummer.\n\n23:14.000 --> 23:15.000\nWhat did you say?\n\n23:15.000 --> 23:16.000\nSummer.\n\n23:16.000 --> 23:17.000\nSummer.\n\n23:17.000 --> 23:18.000\nOh, because it gets hot.\n\n23:18.000 --> 23:24.000\nIt's a dry heat, Jeff.\n\n23:24.000 --> 23:28.000\nJuice of research.\n\n23:28.000 --> 23:30.000\nWhat's the best thing?\n\n23:30.000 --> 23:35.000\nAre you proud to be citizens of Phoenix, Arizona?\n\n23:35.000 --> 23:36.000\nPhoenicians.\n\n23:36.000 --> 23:39.000\nI love that you guys are like an ancient civilization here.\n\n23:39.000 --> 23:40.000\nYeah, that is cool.\n\n23:40.000 --> 23:43.000\nAre you guys about to invade the Carthaginians at some point?\n\n23:43.000 --> 23:44.000\nI love that.\n\n23:44.000 --> 23:45.000\nI don't know.\n\n23:45.000 --> 23:49.000\nPersonally, I think, for me, because I'm a musician,\n\n23:49.000 --> 23:52.000\nI think we have a really good local scene for music.\n\n23:52.000 --> 23:53.000\nWhat do you play?\n\n23:53.000 --> 23:54.000\nGuitar.\n\n23:54.000 --> 23:55.000\nYou do?\n\n23:55.000 --> 23:56.000\nYeah.\n\n23:56.000 --> 23:57.000\nHave you got a guitar here?\n\n23:57.000 --> 23:58.000\nNo.\n\n23:58.000 --> 23:59.000\nIs there a guitar in the house?\n\n23:59.000 --> 24:00.000\nWhat do you play?\n\n24:00.000 --> 24:03.000\nIt varies, but mostly rock.\n\n24:03.000 --> 24:04.000\nYou sing?\n\n24:04.000 --> 24:05.000\nKind of.\n\n24:05.000 --> 24:06.000\nYou do?\n\n24:06.000 --> 24:09.000\nI could, I guess.\n\n24:09.000 --> 24:12.000\nOther brand?\n\n24:12.000 --> 24:19.000\nDo you think that if I were to improvise one of my incredible raps,\n\n24:19.000 --> 24:24.000\nthat you could do the Rihanna or Dino hook?\n\n24:24.000 --> 24:33.000\nWhen I cued you, we could say, please come down to Harmontown.\n\n24:33.000 --> 24:39.000\nDon't turn your frown upside down.\n\n24:39.000 --> 24:41.000\nP is yellow, poop is brown.\n\n24:41.000 --> 24:43.000\nI'm going down to Harmontown.\n\n24:43.000 --> 24:46.000\nCan you remember that?\n\n24:46.000 --> 24:48.000\nOkay.\n\n24:48.000 --> 24:54.000\nPlease come down to Harmontown.\n\n24:54.000 --> 24:57.000\nWait, I already forgot it.\n\n24:57.000 --> 25:01.000\nPlease come down to Harmontown.\n\n25:01.000 --> 25:02.000\nI forgot.\n\n25:02.000 --> 25:04.000\nI thought you were going to let her sing it.\n\n25:04.000 --> 25:08.000\nYeah, I was trying to get her to
