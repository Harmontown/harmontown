{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:03.000\nAll I want to be is a chevrolet public alley-coop.\n\n00:07.000 --> 00:08.000\nAll right.\n\n00:11.000 --> 00:14.000\nHarmon Count is now in session.\n\n00:17.000 --> 00:20.000\nI am your guest counselor, Ryan Ridley.\n\n00:20.000 --> 00:28.000\nComing to the stage, your game master, Spencer Britton.\n\n00:34.000 --> 00:39.000\nAnd now the mayor of Harmon Count and Harmon.\n\n00:39.000 --> 00:45.000\nHarmon!\n\n00:50.000 --> 00:52.000\nIt's like some Haun and Manchin music.\n\n00:52.000 --> 00:53.000\nWhat's that?\n\n00:53.000 --> 00:54.000\nHaun and Manchin music.\n\n00:54.000 --> 00:55.000\nOh.\n\n00:55.000 --> 00:56.000\nThat's what it sounds like to me.\n\n00:56.000 --> 00:57.000\nScary.\n\n00:57.000 --> 01:00.000\nSo it's like the Halloween equivalent of turkey sandwiches.\n\n01:00.000 --> 01:05.000\nWe're just like, we're just using up a couple extra scary things.\n\n01:05.000 --> 01:10.000\nLike, you know, ghosts.\n\n01:10.000 --> 01:12.000\nThey have unfinished business.\n\n01:15.000 --> 01:16.000\nAll right.\n\n01:16.000 --> 01:17.000\nWell, I'm not going to lie to you guys.\n\n01:17.000 --> 01:19.000\nIt's going to be a bad show tonight.\n\n01:19.000 --> 01:21.000\nWe already discussed it beforehand.\n\n01:21.000 --> 01:22.000\nYeah.\n\n01:22.000 --> 01:27.000\nI'll just run through, okay, like the things that I wrote in Microsoft One Note,\n\n01:27.000 --> 01:28.000\nbecause fuck you ever note.\n\n01:28.000 --> 01:29.000\nYay.\n\n01:29.000 --> 01:31.000\nIt's a good app.\n\n01:31.000 --> 01:35.000\nThat's the guy that introduced me to it.\n\n01:35.000 --> 01:36.000\nAll right.\n\n01:36.000 --> 01:41.000\nSo my therapist thinks that my book, she keeps mentioning my bug bites.\n\n01:41.000 --> 01:48.000\nI trusted her before that, because I thought she was like a scientist of the mind,\n\n01:48.000 --> 01:53.000\nbut then she was like, she's like, what's going on with your arms?\n\n01:53.000 --> 01:58.000\nAnd I was like, I have these, if a flea bites me or a mosquito or anything like that,\n\n01:58.000 --> 02:00.000\nlike the bite is there forever.\n\n02:00.000 --> 02:04.000\nThat's one of the many reasons why I'm better off in LA.\n\n02:04.000 --> 02:08.000\nYou know, like in Milwaukee, where there's mosquitoes like for a month of the year,\n\n02:08.000 --> 02:10.000\nlike it would just be covered.\n\n02:10.000 --> 02:13.000\nAnd I don't know, I probably have some allergy or something.\n\n02:13.000 --> 02:15.000\nLike, I don't think it's psychosomatic.\n\n02:15.000 --> 02:16.000\nI don't think it's like,\n\n02:16.000 --> 02:24.000\nOh, she was suggesting that it was like, that it was a symptom of my unresolved wounds.\n\n02:24.000 --> 02:25.000\nWhoa, really?\n\n02:25.000 --> 02:30.000\nAnd I'm like, you and my chiropractor, but I trusted her.\n\n02:30.000 --> 02:33.000\nLike the chiropractor I get, because he's like not a real doctor.\n\n02:33.000 --> 02:38.000\nSo he's just like, oh, and then the first time I ever took off my shirt in front of my chiropractor\n\n02:38.000 --> 02:43.000\nso he could scan me, he's like, oh, you have these open wounds on your back.\n\n02:43.000 --> 02:45.000\nI'm like, it's acne.\n\n02:45.000 --> 02:51.000\nHave you ever seen a person that ever ate anything besides kale?\n\n02:51.000 --> 02:57.000\nIt was just, it made me feel like I was like, oh, he must like, and he's always like pointing out\n\n02:57.000 --> 03:01.000\nlike if I have like lint when I pull out my stuff before I lay on the table,\n\n03:01.000 --> 03:04.000\nhe'll be like, you should get a money clip or something if the money's loose.\n\n03:04.000 --> 03:07.000\nI'm like, Jesus Christ, this guy just hate me.\n\n03:07.000 --> 03:12.000\nLike, he just like looks at me like a big giant, like, like, just, yeah,\n\n03:12.000 --> 03:14.000\njust a pile of fucking like matchsticks.\n\n03:14.000 --> 03:17.000\nHe has to count and sort.\n\n03:17.000 --> 03:21.000\nYou've opened wounds, open, don't say that open sores.\n\n03:21.000 --> 03:24.000\nIt's it's just stop bullying me.\n\n03:24.000 --> 03:30.000\nBut you're saying your therapist really thought you've just psychologically made spider bites appear?\n\n03:30.000 --> 03:33.000\nYeah, like in that Kronenberg movie from the 80s.\n\n03:33.000 --> 03:35.000\nThe brood?\n\n03:35.000 --> 03:37.000\nNo, not Nightbreed.\n\n03:37.000 --> 03:38.000\nNightbreed.\n\n03:38.000 --> 03:40.000\nThat was Clive Barker for God's sakes.\n\n03:40.000 --> 03:41.000\nKronenberg was in it.\n\n03:41.000 --> 03:44.000\nThat guy loves Kronenberg so much he considers Nightbreed a Kronenberg movie\n\n03:44.000 --> 03:48.000\nbecause Kronenberg was was in it as button face.\n\n03:48.000 --> 03:52.000\nThe, the, no, I have like, like, like, if you could see with the camera,\n\n03:52.000 --> 03:56.000\nlike, like, you know, these take, I probably got bit by, I think I,\n\n03:56.000 --> 03:59.000\nmy dogs didn't take their flea meds during the divorce like for a week.\n\n03:59.000 --> 04:02.000\nSo, so then there was probably a flea in the bed.\n\n04:02.000 --> 04:03.000\nThey love me.\n\n04:03.000 --> 04:05.000\nAnd I got a couple of these bites.\n\n04:05.000 --> 04:09.000\nLike, this is like, oh, no, no, I mean, anyways, I'm just saying like,\n\n04:09.000 --> 04:12.000\nI don't trust my therapist anymore because she was like, oh,\n\n04:12.000 --> 04:14.000\nwhat are those things in your arms?\n\n04:14.000 --> 04:16.000\nI'm like, are we already talked about this?\n\n04:16.000 --> 04:17.000\nYou focus on these things.\n\n04:17.000 --> 04:18.000\nIt's like, what is this?\n\n04:18.000 --> 04:19.000\nLike a cold read technique?\n\n04:19.000 --> 04:21.000\nOr you just like pick up on whatever is weird, you know,\n\n04:21.000 --> 04:23.000\nif the person like runs their hands through their hair,\n\n04:23.000 --> 04:25.000\ndo you go like, what are you touching your hair?\n\n04:25.000 --> 04:27.000\nAnd then like, and then they try to bring it back around.\n\n04:27.000 --> 04:29.000\nLike you just kill time for 15 minutes.\n\n04:29.000 --> 04:32.000\nAnd then you go, so it's like touching hair.\n\n04:32.000 --> 04:35.000\nAnd then the person is supposed to go, wow, and leave.\n\n04:35.000 --> 04:38.000\nMy therapist told me today that there's a California law that you have to ask\n\n04:38.000 --> 04:41.000\nwomen if it's okay to have sex beforehand.\n\n04:41.000 --> 04:43.000\nApropos of nothing, she just brought it up.\n\n04:43.000 --> 04:46.000\nSo that made me a little nervous.\n\n04:46.000 --> 04:54.000\nAnd you don't believe her?\n\n04:54.000 --> 04:57.000\nI just wanted more information.\n\n04:57.000 --> 04:58.000\nYou want more information?\n\n04:58.000 --> 05:00.000\nYeah.\n\n05:00.000 --> 05:02.000\nYour therapist, can we talk about your therapist?\n\n05:02.000 --> 05:03.000\nSure.\n\n05:03.000 --> 05:04.000\nIs it okay?\n\n05:04.000 --> 05:05.000\nI guess so.\n\n05:05.000 --> 05:08.000\nBecause you said, because Ryan started going to his current therapist,\n\n05:08.000 --> 05:11.000\nsame situation as me, you started going to a therapist that you met\n\n05:11.000 --> 05:13.000\nas a couples therapist.\n\n05:13.000 --> 05:16.000\nAnd now the relationship is over, but you're still seeing this person.\n\n05:16.000 --> 05:20.000\nWith one notable patch, which is that you were going to,\n\n05:20.000 --> 05:22.000\ncan I talk about that?\n\n05:22.000 --> 05:23.000\nI don't know.\n\n05:23.000 --> 05:24.000\nBut I'm not going to stop you.\n\n05:24.000 --> 05:25.000\nOkay, all right.\n\n05:25.000 --> 05:32.000\nWell, you said that she's like, like you went to her because she is open\n\n05:32.000 --> 05:35.000\nto the concept of polyamorousness.\n\n05:35.000 --> 05:38.000\nI mean, I don't know if that's why we went, but you know,\n\n05:38.000 --> 05:40.000\nthey happen to be her specialty.\n\n05:40.000 --> 05:41.000\nYeah.\n\n05:41.000 --> 05:42.000\nAll right.\n\n05:42.000 --> 05:44.000\nBut then the couple broke up.\n\n05:44.000 --> 05:49.000\nAnd then now he's just seeing a lady about his own brain working.\n\n05:49.000 --> 05:52.000\nBut every once in a while, she brings up the fact.\n\n05:52.000 --> 05:54.000\nShe's like, well, you know, as a polyamorous therapist,\n\n05:54.000 --> 05:59.000\nI think you should work out your strategy.\n\n05:59.000 --> 06:01.000\nAnd you're like, wait, oh, yeah, that's right.\n\n06:01.000 --> 06:03.000\nI came to you because you've...\n\n06:03.000 --> 06:05.000\nShe's definitely never going to judge me.\n\n06:05.000 --> 06:06.000\nI mean, you know what I mean?\n\n06:06.000 --> 06:08.000\nThere's no boundaries there.\n\n06:08.000 --> 06:09.000\nRight.\n\n06:09.000 --> 06:10.000\nIf she was like, I think you play too many video games,\n\n06:10.000 --> 06:13.000\nyou'd be like, why don't you fuck everybody?\n\n06:13.000 --> 06:16.000\nRegardless of whatever the situation is.\n\n06:16.000 --> 06:18.000\nCrazy lady.\n\n06:18.000 --> 06:20.000\nBut yeah, I don't know.\n\n06:20.000 --> 06:23.000\nBut it's like, I don't, I mean, come on, you know,\n\n06:23.000 --> 06:27.000\nwhat is she saying that my immune system is weakened\n\n06:27.000 --> 06:31.000\nbecause of my wounds from childhood or something like that?\n\n06:31.000 --> 06:34.000\nYou're doing her work for her, it sounds like.\n\n06:34.000 --> 06:35.000\nWell, no, she's trying to...\n\n06:35.000 --> 06:37.000\nI mean, she went down this road and I was like,\n\n06:37.000 --> 06:38.000\nI just wanted to...\n\n06:38.000 --> 06:40.000\nI was just like, man, come on.\n\n06:40.000 --> 06:43.000\nI had a friend who, when he would be really stressed,\n\n06:43.000 --> 06:46.000\nhe would have a weird reaction to his detergent.\n\n06:46.000 --> 06:48.000\nAnd when he wasn't stressed, he wouldn't.\n\n06:48.000 --> 06:51.000\nSo he would switch detergents depending on how rough of a time\n\n06:51.000 --> 06:55.000\nin his life he was having.\n\n06:55.000 --> 06:56.000\nAll right, so there's a...\n\n06:56.000 --> 06:58.000\nBecause he really loved that guy,\n\n06:58.000 --> 07:00.000\nloved that detergent.\n\n07:00.000 --> 07:04.000\nWell, no, he hated the other one.\n\n07:04.000 --> 07:06.000\nBecause apparently the stuff he was allergic to...\n\n07:06.000 --> 07:08.000\nBut he didn't hate it enough to stress him out.\n\n07:08.000 --> 07:10.000\nBecause otherwise, that would have...\n\n07:10.000 --> 07:12.000\nWe'll see the mobius strip there.\n\n07:12.000 --> 07:16.000\nI don't, I'm sure it's there, but I don't see it.\n\n07:16.000 --> 07:17.000\nWell, trust me, it's there.\n\n07:17.000 --> 07:19.000\nOr I'm drunk.\n\n07:19.000 --> 07:21.000\nI just, I don't know.\n\n07:21.000 --> 07:23.000\nI guess I'm saying, like, I really like my therapist\n\n07:23.000 --> 07:25.000\nand I just don't want her to believe in...\n\n07:25.000 --> 07:30.000\nOkay, so, you know, I don't know, like, there was that time\n\n07:30.000 --> 07:31.000\nwhen she kind of implied\n\n07:31.000 --> 07:34.000\nthat she kind of a little bit believed in ghosts.\n\n07:34.000 --> 07:38.000\nBecause we were talking about our friend that passed away.\n\n07:38.000 --> 07:42.000\nAnd now I felt like I could see him on,\n\n07:42.000 --> 07:45.000\nlike I could sense him on set, on the community set,\n\n07:45.000 --> 07:47.000\nlike cracking wise and stuff.\n\n07:47.000 --> 07:50.000\nAnd she, like, she was like, and I was like,\n\n07:50.000 --> 07:54.000\nI guess that's the denial part of coping with the grief,\n\n07:54.000 --> 07:55.000\nyou know, or whatever.\n\n07:55.000 --> 07:56.000\nShe's like, well, you know, there's that,\n\n07:56.000 --> 07:59.000\nbut there's also just the fact that she proceeded\n\n07:59.000 --> 08:00.000\nto just, like, launch into this thing.\n\n08:00.000 --> 08:02.000\nIt was just like, oh, or maybe his spirit,\n\n08:02.000 --> 08:05.000\nlike, floated down from parts and wreck\n\n08:05.000 --> 08:07.000\nto watch me shoot community.\n\n08:07.000 --> 08:09.000\nBecause he came back and was like,\n\n08:09.000 --> 08:11.000\nwhoa, there's no floor or I'm a ghost.\n\n08:11.000 --> 08:15.000\nAnd, like, landed down at community.\n\n08:15.000 --> 08:16.000\nThat makes much more sense\n\n08:16.000 --> 08:18.000\nthan just I was fucked up a little bit\n\n08:18.000 --> 08:20.000\nabout the concept of death.\n\n08:20.000 --> 08:22.000\nAll right, so anyways, bug bites, whatever.\n\n08:22.000 --> 08:24.000\nI guess I have gross bug bites.\n\n08:24.000 --> 08:25.000\nI guess that's what she was,\n\n08:25.000 --> 08:26.000\nthat's what I really got from it,\n\n08:26.000 --> 08:28.000\nis, like, even my therapist who's supposed to,\n\n08:28.000 --> 08:30.000\nlike, kind of accept me and want me to be happy,\n\n08:30.000 --> 08:32.000\nshe's like, yeah, but I wish those fucking gross\n\n08:32.000 --> 08:34.000\nbites weren't on your arm.\n\n08:34.000 --> 08:36.000\nSo I'm just going to start wearing turtlenecks\n\n08:36.000 --> 08:38.000\nand, like, really tight, like, cuffs,\n\n08:38.000 --> 08:41.000\nso, like, I just, like, a mummin' shots performer\n\n08:41.000 --> 08:42.000\nand just walk around.\n\n08:42.000 --> 08:43.000\nWhy not her flaws, bro?\n\n08:43.000 --> 08:46.000\nYeah, exactly, like, you don't see me\n\n08:46.000 --> 08:48.000\njust, like, talking, looking at you\n\n08:48.000 --> 08:51.000\nand recognizing your face.\n\n08:51.000 --> 08:53.000\nAll right, just really briefly,\n\n08:53.000 --> 08:55.000\nthe 3D touch on the phone, I just don't get it.\n\n08:55.000 --> 08:57.000\nIt's like, now you can touch your phone too hard.\n\n08:57.000 --> 08:58.000\nI don't get it, I don't get it.\n\n08:58.000 --> 09:00.000\nI don't understand, you keep pressing things\n\n09:00.000 --> 09:01.000\nand now it's like, you can't,\n\n09:01.000 --> 09:03.000\nif you press too hard, it doesn't do anything\n\n09:03.000 --> 09:04.000\nand then you have to, like, press it.\n\n09:04.000 --> 09:06.000\nI'm sorry, I didn't mean to press you too hard.\n\n09:06.000 --> 09:07.000\nIt's fucking stupid.\n\n09:07.000 --> 09:09.000\nAnd I, there's a setting for the,\n\n09:09.000 --> 09:11.000\nthere shouldn't have to be a setting.\n\n09:11.000 --> 09:13.000\nShut up!\n\n09:13.000 --> 09:16.000\nSo, like, oh, is Apple now in the business\n\n09:16.000 --> 09:18.000\nof, like, oh, the settings?\n\n09:18.000 --> 09:20.000\nNo, that's called something other than Apple.\n\n09:20.000 --> 09:22.000\nThe whole appeal of this thing is that\n\n09:22.000 --> 09:24.000\nit comes out of the box and it works.\n\n09:24.000 --> 09:26.000\nFuck you, don't even tell,\n\n09:26.000 --> 09:28.000\nyou're complaining for nothing,\n\n09:28.000 --> 09:31.000\nall you gotta do is, what, read the instructions?\n\n09:31.000 --> 09:33.000\nOr go into the menus?\n\n09:33.000 --> 09:36.000\nHow about put two buttons instead of one then\n\n09:36.000 --> 09:39.000\nif we're gonna get all into the hands-on customization?\n\n09:39.000 --> 09:42.000\nThis guy, this guy watched two buttons on his phone.\n\n09:42.000 --> 09:44.000\nMe too.\n\n09:44.000 --> 09:47.000\nJust call it an iPhone Pro.\n\n09:47.000 --> 09:49.000\nTwo buttons, maybe.\n\n09:49.000 --> 09:51.000\nImagine, twice as much you could do.\n\n09:51.000 --> 09:53.000\nInstead, it was like, you didn't touch it too hard.\n\n09:53.000 --> 09:56.000\nA chiropractor, I talked, I made up with my chiropractor.\n\n09:56.000 --> 09:58.000\nBut the jury's still out.\n\n09:58.000 --> 10:00.000\nNow I'm worried about my therapist.\n\n10:00.000 --> 10:02.000\nI'm alone in the world.\n\n10:02.000 --> 10:04.000\nCut to the chase.\n\n10:04.000 --> 10:06.000\nI bought two mannequins.\n\n10:06.000 --> 10:08.000\nYeah.\n\n10:08.000 --> 10:10.000\nTwo.\n\n10:10.000 --> 10:12.000\nAre they different?\n\n10:12.000 --> 10:15.000\nAnd I'm probably gonna get a real doll.\n\n10:15.000 --> 10:17.000\nAgain.\n\n10:17.000 --> 10:19.000\nBecause here's the thing, here's the thing about you groaning.\n\n10:19.000 --> 10:21.000\nIt makes you bad people.\n\n10:21.000 --> 10:23.000\nAnd here's why.\n\n10:23.000 --> 10:25.000\nBecause think about it.\n\n10:25.000 --> 10:27.000\nIf you're 42 years old\n\n10:27.000 --> 10:29.000\nand you've never had a relationship\n\n10:29.000 --> 10:31.000\nthat lasted longer than two years,\n\n10:31.000 --> 10:34.000\nand you just finished your first and last marriage\n\n10:34.000 --> 10:38.000\nthat didn't even make it as long as you usually dated,\n\n10:38.000 --> 10:41.000\nthat, like, are you a good person\n\n10:41.000 --> 10:43.000\nif you keep dating at that point?\n\n10:43.000 --> 10:45.000\nLike, 42?\n\n10:45.000 --> 10:48.000\nNo. You ladies that are staying there are just hot for me.\n\n10:48.000 --> 10:51.000\nYou just want...\n\n10:51.000 --> 10:53.000\nOr you...\n\n10:53.000 --> 10:55.000\nOh, that's Justin's assistant.\n\n10:55.000 --> 10:57.000\nI was gonna say...\n\n10:57.000 --> 10:59.000\nShe just wants me to be busy,\n\n10:59.000 --> 11:03.000\nso she doesn't have to bring me drinks at Comic-Con.\n\n11:03.000 --> 11:05.000\nNo, I'm really serious.\n\n11:05.000 --> 11:08.000\nI'm like, it's the certs commercial in you\n\n11:08.000 --> 11:12.000\nthat's like, yes, it's healthy to do what?\n\n11:12.000 --> 11:15.000\nYou have to subject yourself and other people\n\n11:15.000 --> 11:17.000\nto your emotional incompatibility.\n\n11:17.000 --> 11:19.000\nIsn't that the story of Frozen?\n\n11:19.000 --> 11:21.000\nIsn't the one sister like, I haven't seen it,\n\n11:21.000 --> 11:23.000\nbut isn't that kind of myth?\n\n11:23.000 --> 11:26.000\nYeah, except for the part where she's not supposed to be frozen.\n\n11:26.000 --> 11:28.000\nBecause they had to tell a story, so it's like,\n\n11:28.000 --> 11:30.000\noh, she gets unfrozen at the end, right?\n\n11:30.000 --> 11:32.000\nLike, she's not as frozen as much.\n\n11:32.000 --> 11:34.000\nI haven't seen it.\n\n11:34.000 --> 11:36.000\nBut it's like...\n\n11:36.000 --> 11:38.000\nWhat if I'm just at the part...\n\n11:38.000 --> 11:40.000\nLike, if this were frozen,\n\n11:40.000 --> 11:43.000\nthe sound that I made out of ice power\n\n11:43.000 --> 11:45.000\nwhen I sing the song, what's the song?\n\n11:45.000 --> 11:48.000\nI gotta be me.\n\n11:48.000 --> 11:50.000\nI gotta be me.\n\n11:50.000 --> 11:55.000\nFrozen inside, I'm so in love with everything\n\n11:55.000 --> 11:57.000\nexcept for other people.\n\n11:57.000 --> 11:59.000\nI gotta be me.\n\n11:59.000 --> 12:02.000\nEvery snowflake has a different shape\n\n12:02.000 --> 12:05.000\nand every human evolved from an ape.\n\n12:05.000 --> 12:08.000\nBut I gotta be me.\n\n12:08.000 --> 12:12.000\nCause I'm frozen, Stephanie.\n\n12:12.000 --> 12:14.000\nYeah, you guys are right.\n\n12:14.000 --> 12:16.000\nYou're right to applaud.\n\n12:16.000 --> 12:19.000\nYou did it.\n\n12:19.000 --> 12:21.000\nBut if...\n\n12:21.000 --> 12:24.000\nSo why is it so hard to imagine me\n\n12:24.000 --> 12:26.000\nafter a divorce going,\n\n12:26.000 --> 12:31.000\nI'm gonna order a $6000 sex doll\n\n12:31.000 --> 12:34.000\ncause I got a nylon fetish\n\n12:34.000 --> 12:38.000\nand when I see people, all I see is their hair\n\n12:38.000 --> 12:39.000\nand their clothes\n\n12:39.000 --> 12:43.000\nand I don't want to subject anyone over to that again.\n\n12:43.000 --> 12:48.000\nSo I got a $6000 sex doll.\n\n12:48.000 --> 12:51.000\nI just dress like an aerobic instructor\n\n12:51.000 --> 12:53.000\nfor one episode, a night writer.\n\n12:53.000 --> 12:56.000\nI just have it sitting around\n\n12:56.000 --> 12:59.000\napproving of me playing Minecraft.\n\n12:59.000 --> 13:01.000\nWouldn't that be...\n\n13:01.000 --> 13:02.000\nWhat's missing from that?\n\n13:02.000 --> 13:05.000\nJonah Hill?\n\n13:05.000 --> 13:06.000\nYou want my cat to talk\n\n13:06.000 --> 13:08.000\nin order to make that adorable?\n\n13:08.000 --> 13:10.000\nCause believe me, it is empowering.\n\n13:10.000 --> 13:11.000\nIt is important.\n\n13:11.000 --> 13:13.000\nI think what I'm doing is heroic\n\n13:13.000 --> 13:15.000\nis saying I don't want to...\n\n13:15.000 --> 13:18.000\nI'm just gonna tenderly kiss the ankle\n\n13:18.000 --> 13:21.000\nof a dead thing\n\n13:21.000 --> 13:23.000\nand then jerk off.\n\n13:23.000 --> 13:26.000\nIt takes five minutes out of a day.\n\n13:26.000 --> 13:28.000\nAnd then I'm off the market.\n\n13:28.000 --> 13:31.000\nI'm back out here and I'm helping you.\n\n13:31.000 --> 13:33.000\nI'm not hurting you.\n\n13:33.000 --> 13:35.000\nWorks for me?\n\n13:35.000 --> 13:37.000\nI mean that you're doing it.\n\n13:37.000 --> 13:38.000\nI would never want to do that.\n\n13:38.000 --> 13:39.000\nThat sounds like a horrible\n\n13:39.000 --> 13:41.000\nTwilight Zone nightmare.\n\n13:41.000 --> 13:44.000\nSo never at 42 to hang up\n\n13:44.000 --> 13:47.000\nyour hat from love.\n\n13:47.000 --> 13:48.000\nOh, you don't mean the doll part?\n\n13:48.000 --> 13:51.000\nWell, that doll part's horrible too.\n\n13:51.000 --> 13:53.000\nBut I think the funniest part is\n\n13:53.000 --> 13:55.000\nyou have to ask for approval from your accountant.\n\n13:55.000 --> 13:57.000\nYeah, that's true.\n\n13:57.000 --> 14:00.000\nI have financial

but I have to explain to them.\n\n14:14.000 --> 14:16.000\nIt's not fraud.\n\n14:16.000 --> 14:18.000\nNot financial fraud.\n\n14:18.000 --> 14:21.000\nIt's emotional and spiritual fraud.\n\n14:21.000 --> 14:23.000\nCertainly.\n\n14:23.000 --> 14:25.000\nThere's definitely a heist going on\n\n14:25.000 --> 14:28.000\nof the soul.\n\n14:28.000 --> 14:30.000\nAnd definitely a crime being committed\n\n14:30.000 --> 14:33.000\nfor whichever guys have to haul the crate\n\n14:33.000 --> 14:38.000\nup the mountain to my palatial estate\n\n14:38.000 --> 14:40.000\nwhere Beth Bootson,

You're saying the opposite.\n\n51:20.000 --> 51:22.000\nThe sea level is rising,\n\n51:22.000 --> 51:24.000\nbut the fish are all sinking to the bottom.\n\n51:24.000 --> 51:26.000\nThese corpses.\n\n51:26.000 --> 51:28.000\nFish float when they die.\n\n51:28.000 --> 51:30.000\nWho said that's wrong?\n\n51:30.000 --> 51:32.000\nFish float when they die.\n\n51:34.000 --> 51:36.000\nIt's all a metaphor.\n\n51:38.000 --> 51:40.000\nWhat do we really think is going to happen?\n\n51:40.000 --> 51:42.000\nIt's just going to be like, okay, so\n\n51:42.000 --> 51:44.000\nthere'll be\n\n51:44.000 --> 51:46.000\nbecause it's kind of, it's just so many\n\n51:46.000 --> 51:48.000\nvariables because, like, the thing that\n\n51:48.000 --> 51:50.000\npanics me is, like,\n\n51:50.000 --> 51:52.000\nsea level, because\n\n51:52.000 --> 51:54.000\nthe scientists talk about, like, okay, the sea level\n\n51:54.000 --> 51:56.000\nis going to do this and the ice caps are going to do that.\n\n51:56.000 --> 51:58.000\nBut as soon as that stuff\n\n51:58.000 --> 52:00.000\nhas the potential to affect\n\n52:00.000 --> 52:02.000\nthe dollar, then everything's\n\n52:02.000 --> 52:04.000\njust going to collapse. And it won't be\n\n52:04.000 --> 52:06.000\nit won't be because the ocean is high\n\n52:06.000 --> 52:08.000\nthat, like, you're\n\n52:08.000 --> 52:10.000\nlike wearing armor made out of\n\n52:10.000 --> 52:12.000\nbottle caps. Like, you're, you're, it'll\n\n52:12.000 --> 52:14.000\nbe because, like, everything just\n\n52:14.000 --> 52:16.000\nwent to shit and the cops started\n\n52:16.000 --> 52:18.000\nshowing up to work or started hunting people\n\n52:18.000 --> 52:20.000\nand, like, like, like\n\n52:20.000 --> 52:22.000\nnothing worked anymore and there was no\n\n52:22.000 --> 52:24.000\njobs and everyone was just, like, riding around\n\n52:24.000 --> 52:26.000\na wasteland going, like, yeah!\n\n52:26.000 --> 52:28.000\nWhat do we\n\n52:28.000 --> 52:30.000\nhave here?

I don't\n\n52:38.000 --> 52:40.000\nshow that I'm afraid of it\n\n52:40.000 --> 52:42.000\nor I'm not. Maybe that's\n\n52:42.000 --> 52:44.000\nbeen, I mean, it only takes two generations\n\n52:44.000 --> 52:46.000\nto leave the gene pool.\n\n52:46.000 --> 52:48.000\nPerhaps all the people that were\n\n52:48.000 --> 52:50.000\nafraid are dead and only the\n\n52:50.000 --> 52:52.000\npeople that were\n\n52:52.000 --> 52:54.000\nconfident in the post-apocalypse\n\n52:54.000 --> 52:56.000\nare, they just kept\n\n52:56.000 --> 52:58.000\nreproduced and I'm\n\n52:58.000 --> 53:00.000\ntheir progeny.\n\n53:00.000 --> 53:02.000\nI'm a man\n\n53:02.000 --> 53:04.000\nof impulsiveness\n\n53:04.000 --> 53:06.000\nand I love living.\n\n53:06.000 --> 53:08.000\nI have borderline personality disorder.\n\n53:08.000 --> 53:10.000\nExcuse me. Is that kind of already\n\n53:10.000 --> 53:12.000\nhappening? Yeah, I mean\n\n53:12.000 --> 53:14.000\nit is. Just, like, slowly, though.\n\n53:14.000 --> 53:16.000\nIt's not, like, one day that'll happen\n\n53:16.000 --> 53:18.000\nbut it's just, like, happening really slowly\n\n53:18.000 --> 53:20.000\nand we're kind of, like, seeing it\n\n53:20.000 --> 53:22.000\nand then we just, like, get used to it.\n\n53:22.000 --> 53:24.000\nSo by the time it happens, we'll decide\n\n53:24.000 --> 53:26.000\nwhat's happening. I have been\n\n53:26.000 --> 53:28.000\nseeing a lot of orange mohawks lately.\n\n53:28.000 --> 53:30.000\nAnd, like, one chain\n\n53:30.000 --> 53:32.000\nacross the chest.\n\n53:32.000 --> 53:34.000\nBut, like, you know, it's true, I mean,\n\n53:34.000 --> 53:36.000\nwhen you look at the, like, there's always\n\n53:36.000 --> 53:38.000\ncrazy things that we always talk about. We go,\n\n53:38.000 --> 53:40.000\nlike, that's so crazy but it's, like, well, it's not\n\n53:40.000 --> 53:42.000\ncrazy if the end result is, like,\n\n53:42.000 --> 53:44.000\nMad Max because the idea that\n\n53:44.000 --> 53:46.000\nwe have a quarter of the population\n\n53:46.000 --> 53:48.000\nin prison, like, like,\n\n53:48.000 --> 53:50.000\nI can't remember, I can never remember that statistic.\n\n53:50.000 --> 53:52.000\nIt's, like, the, what is it,\n\n53:52.000 --> 53:54.000\nwhat is the quarter thing? It's, like,\n\n53:54.000 --> 53:56.000\nit has something to do with how much\n\n53:56.000 --> 53:58.000\nof America's population is\n\n53:58.000 --> 54:00.000\nin prison versus how much of the,\n\n54:00.000 --> 54:02.000\nI can't remember the statistic. A quarter.\n\n54:02.000 --> 54:04.000\nWell, it's, is it a quarter of the world's\n\n54:04.000 --> 54:06.000\nprisoners are in American\n\n54:06.000 --> 54:08.000\nprisons? Yeah.
