WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
All I want to be is a chevrolet public alley-coop.

00:07.000 --> 00:08.000
All right.

00:11.000 --> 00:14.000
Harmon Count is now in session.

00:17.000 --> 00:20.000
I am your guest counselor, Ryan Ridley.

00:20.000 --> 00:28.000
Coming to the stage, your game master, Spencer Britton.

00:34.000 --> 00:39.000
And now the mayor of Harmon Count and Harmon.

00:39.000 --> 00:45.000
Harmon!

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
It's like some Haun and Manchin music.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
What's that?

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
Haun and Manchin music.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
Oh.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
That's what it sounds like to me.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
Scary.

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
So it's like the Halloween equivalent of turkey sandwiches.

01:00.000 --> 01:05.000
We're just like, we're just using up a couple extra scary things.

01:05.000 --> 01:10.000
Like, you know, ghosts.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
They have unfinished business.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
All right.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
Well, I'm not going to lie to you guys.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
It's going to be a bad show tonight.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
We already discussed it beforehand.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
Yeah.

01:22.000 --> 01:27.000
I'll just run through, okay, like the things that I wrote in Microsoft One Note,

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
because fuck you ever note.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
Yay.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
It's a good app.

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
That's the guy that introduced me to it.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
All right.

01:36.000 --> 01:41.000
So my therapist thinks that my book, she keeps mentioning my bug bites.

01:41.000 --> 01:48.000
I trusted her before that, because I thought she was like a scientist of the mind,

01:48.000 --> 01:53.000
but then she was like, she's like, what's going on with your arms?

01:53.000 --> 01:58.000
And I was like, I have these, if a flea bites me or a mosquito or anything like that,

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
like the bite is there forever.

02:00.000 --> 02:04.000
That's one of the many reasons why I'm better off in LA.

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
You know, like in Milwaukee, where there's mosquitoes like for a month of the year,

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
like it would just be covered.

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
And I don't know, I probably have some allergy or something.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
Like, I don't think it's psychosomatic.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
I don't think it's like,

02:16.000 --> 02:24.000
Oh, she was suggesting that it was like, that it was a symptom of my unresolved wounds.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
Whoa, really?

02:25.000 --> 02:30.000
And I'm like, you and my chiropractor, but I trusted her.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
Like the chiropractor I get, because he's like not a real doctor.

02:33.000 --> 02:38.000
So he's just like, oh, and then the first time I ever took off my shirt in front of my chiropractor

02:38.000 --> 02:43.000
so he could scan me, he's like, oh, you have these open wounds on your back.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
I'm like, it's acne.

02:45.000 --> 02:51.000
Have you ever seen a person that ever ate anything besides kale?

02:51.000 --> 02:57.000
It was just, it made me feel like I was like, oh, he must like, and he's always like pointing out

02:57.000 --> 03:01.000
like if I have like lint when I pull out my stuff before I lay on the table,

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
he'll be like, you should get a money clip or something if the money's loose.

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
I'm like, Jesus Christ, this guy just hate me.

03:07.000 --> 03:12.000
Like, he just like looks at me like a big giant, like, like, just, yeah,

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
just a pile of fucking like matchsticks.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
He has to count and sort.

03:17.000 --> 03:21.000
You've opened wounds, open, don't say that open sores.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
It's it's just stop bullying me.

03:24.000 --> 03:30.000
But you're saying your therapist really thought you've just psychologically made spider bites appear?

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
Yeah, like in that Kronenberg movie from the 80s.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
The brood?

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
No, not Nightbreed.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
Nightbreed.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
That was Clive Barker for God's sakes.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
Kronenberg was in it.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
That guy loves Kronenberg so much he considers Nightbreed a Kronenberg movie

03:44.000 --> 03:48.000
because Kronenberg was was in it as button face.

03:48.000 --> 03:52.000
The, the, no, I have like, like, like, if you could see with the camera,

03:52.000 --> 03:56.000
like, like, you know, these take, I probably got bit by, I think I,

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
my dogs didn't take their flea meds during the divorce like for a week.

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
So, so then there was probably a flea in the bed.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
They love me.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
And I got a couple of these bites.

04:05.000 --> 04:09.000
Like, this is like, oh, no, no, I mean, anyways, I'm just saying like,

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
I don't trust my therapist anymore because she was like, oh,

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
what are those things in your arms?

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
I'm like, are we already talked about this?

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
You focus on these things.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
It's like, what is this?

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
Like a cold read technique?

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
Or you just like pick up on whatever is weird, you know,

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
if the person like runs their hands through their hair,

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
do you go like, what are you touching your hair?

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
And then like, and then they try to bring it back around.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
Like you just kill time for 15 minutes.

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
And then you go, so it's like touching hair.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
And then the person is supposed to go, wow, and leave.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
My therapist told me today that there's a California law that you have to ask

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
women if it's okay to have sex beforehand.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
Apropos of nothing, she just brought it up.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
So that made me a little nervous.

04:46.000 --> 04:54.000
And you don't believe her?

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
I just wanted more information.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
You want more information?

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
Yeah.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
Your therapist, can we talk about your therapist?

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
Sure.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
Is it okay?

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
I guess so.

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
Because you said, because Ryan started going to his current therapist,

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
same situation as me, you started going to a therapist that you met

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
as a couples therapist.

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
And now the relationship is over, but you're still seeing this person.

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
With one notable patch, which is that you were going to,

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
can I talk about that?

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
I don't know.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
But I'm not going to stop you.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
Okay, all right.

05:25.000 --> 05:32.000
Well, you said that she's like, like you went to her because she is open

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
to the concept of polyamorousness.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
I mean, I don't know if that's why we went, but you know,

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
they happen to be her specialty.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
Yeah.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
All right.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
But then the couple broke up.

05:44.000 --> 05:49.000
And then now he's just seeing a lady about his own brain working.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
But every once in a while, she brings up the fact.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
She's like, well, you know, as a polyamorous therapist,

05:54.000 --> 05:59.000
I think you should work out your strategy.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
And you're like, wait, oh, yeah, that's right.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
I came to you because you've...

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
She's definitely never going to judge me.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
I mean, you know what I mean?

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
There's no boundaries there.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
Right.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
If she was like, I think you play too many video games,

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
you'd be like, why don't you fuck everybody?

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
Regardless of whatever the situation is.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
Crazy lady.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
But yeah, I don't know.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
But it's like, I don't, I mean, come on, you know,

06:23.000 --> 06:27.000
what is she saying that my immune system is weakened

06:27.000 --> 06:31.000
because of my wounds from childhood or something like that?

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
You're doing her work for her, it sounds like.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
Well, no, she's trying to...

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
I mean, she went down this road and I was like,

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
I just wanted to...

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
I was just like, man, come on.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
I had a friend who, when he would be really stressed,

06:43.000 --> 06:46.000
he would have a weird reaction to his detergent.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
And when he wasn't stressed, he wouldn't.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
So he would switch detergents depending on how rough of a time

06:51.000 --> 06:55.000
in his life he was having.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
All right, so there's a...

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
Because he really loved that guy,

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
loved that detergent.

07:00.000 --> 07:04.000
Well, no, he hated the other one.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
Because apparently the stuff he was allergic to...

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
But he didn't hate it enough to stress him out.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
Because otherwise, that would have...

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
We'll see the mobius strip there.

07:12.000 --> 07:16.000
I don't, I'm sure it's there, but I don't see it.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
Well, trust me, it's there.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
Or I'm drunk.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
I just, I don't know.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
I guess I'm saying, like, I really like my therapist

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
and I just don't want her to believe in...

07:25.000 --> 07:30.000
Okay, so, you know, I don't know, like, there was that time

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
when she kind of implied

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
that she kind of a little bit believed in ghosts.

07:34.000 --> 07:38.000
Because we were talking about our friend that passed away.

07:38.000 --> 07:42.000
And now I felt like I could see him on,

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
like I could sense him on set, on the community set,

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
like cracking wise and stuff.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
And she, like, she was like, and I was like,

07:50.000 --> 07:54.000
I guess that's the denial part of coping with the grief,

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
you know, or whatever.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
She's like, well, you know, there's that,

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
but there's also just the fact that she proceeded

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
to just, like, launch into this thing.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
It was just like, oh, or maybe his spirit,

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
like, floated down from parts and wreck

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
to watch me shoot community.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
Because he came back and was like,

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
whoa, there's no floor or I'm a ghost.

08:11.000 --> 08:15.000
And, like, landed down at community.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
That makes much more sense

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
than just I was fucked up a little bit

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
about the concept of death.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
All right, so anyways, bug bites, whatever.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
I guess I have gross bug bites.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
I guess that's what she was,

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
that's what I really got from it,

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
is, like, even my therapist who's supposed to,

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
like, kind of accept me and want me to be happy,

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
she's like, yeah, but I wish those fucking gross

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
bites weren't on your arm.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
So I'm just going to start wearing turtlenecks

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
and, like, really tight, like, cuffs,

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
so, like, I just, like, a mummin' shots performer

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
and just walk around.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
Why not her flaws, bro?

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
Yeah, exactly, like, you don't see me

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
just, like, talking, looking at you

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
and recognizing your face.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
All right, just really briefly,

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
the 3D touch on the phone, I just don't get it.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
It's like, now you can touch your phone too hard.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
I don't get it, I don't get it.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
I don't understand, you keep pressing things

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
and now it's like, you can't,

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
if you press too hard, it doesn't do anything

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
and then you have to, like, press it.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to press you too hard.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
It's fucking stupid.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
And I, there's a setting for the,

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
there shouldn't have to be a setting.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
Shut up!

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
So, like, oh, is Apple now in the business

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
of, like, oh, the settings?

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
No, that's called something other than Apple.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
The whole appeal of this thing is that

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
it comes out of the box and it works.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
Fuck you, don't even tell,

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
you're complaining for nothing,

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
all you gotta do is, what, read the instructions?

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
Or go into the menus?

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
How about put two buttons instead of one then

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
if we're gonna get all into the hands-on customization?

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
This guy, this guy watched two buttons on his phone.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
Me too.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
Just call it an iPhone Pro.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
Two buttons, maybe.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
Imagine, twice as much you could do.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
Instead, it was like, you didn't touch it too hard.

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
A chiropractor, I talked, I made up with my chiropractor.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
But the jury's still out.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
Now I'm worried about my therapist.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
I'm alone in the world.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
Cut to the chase.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
I bought two mannequins.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
Yeah.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
Two.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
Are they different?

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
And I'm probably gonna get a real doll.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
Again.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
Because here's the thing, here's the thing about you groaning.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
It makes you bad people.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
And here's why.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
Because think about it.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
If you're 42 years old

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
and you've never had a relationship

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
that lasted longer than two years,

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
and you just finished your first and last marriage

10:34.000 --> 10:38.000
that didn't even make it as long as you usually dated,

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
that, like, are you a good person

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
if you keep dating at that point?

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
Like, 42?

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
No. You ladies that are staying there are just hot for me.

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
You just want...

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
Or you...

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
Oh, that's Justin's assistant.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
I was gonna say...

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
She just wants me to be busy,

10:59.000 --> 11:03.000
so she doesn't have to bring me drinks at Comic-Con.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
No, I'm really serious.

11:05.000 --> 11:08.000
I'm like, it's the certs commercial in you

11:08.000 --> 11:12.000
that's like, yes, it's healthy to do what?

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
You have to subject yourself and other people

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
to your emotional incompatibility.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
Isn't that the story of Frozen?

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
Isn't the one sister like, I haven't seen it,

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
but isn't that kind of myth?

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
Yeah, except for the part where she's not supposed to be frozen.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
Because they had to tell a story, so it's like,

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
oh, she gets unfrozen at the end, right?

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
Like, she's not as frozen as much.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
I haven't seen it.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
But it's like...

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
What if I'm just at the part...

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
Like, if this were frozen,

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
the sound that I made out of ice power

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
when I sing the song, what's the song?

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
I gotta be me.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
I gotta be me.

11:50.000 --> 11:55.000
Frozen inside, I'm so in love with everything

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
except for other people.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
I gotta be me.

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
Every snowflake has a different shape

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
and every human evolved from an ape.

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
But I gotta be me.

12:08.000 --> 12:12.000
Cause I'm frozen, Stephanie.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
Yeah, you guys are right.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
You're right to applaud.

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
You did it.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
But if...

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
So why is it so hard to imagine me

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
after a divorce going,

12:26.000 --> 12:31.000
I'm gonna order a $6000 sex doll

12:31.000 --> 12:34.000
cause I got a nylon fetish

12:34.000 --> 12:38.000
and when I see people, all I see is their hair

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
and their clothes

12:39.000 --> 12:43.000
and I don't want to subject anyone over to that again.

12:43.000 --> 12:48.000
So I got a $6000 sex doll.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
I just dress like an aerobic instructor

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
for one episode, a night writer.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
I just have it sitting around

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
approving of me playing Minecraft.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
Wouldn't that be...

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
What's missing from that?

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
Jonah Hill?

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
You want my cat to talk

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
in order to make that adorable?

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
Cause believe me, it is empowering.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
It is important.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
I think what I'm doing is heroic

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
is saying I don't want to...

13:15.000 --> 13:18.000
I'm just gonna tenderly kiss the ankle

13:18.000 --> 13:21.000
of a dead thing

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
and then jerk off.

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
It takes five minutes out of a day.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
And then I'm off the market.

13:28.000 --> 13:31.000
I'm back out here and I'm helping you.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
I'm not hurting you.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
Works for me?

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
I mean that you're doing it.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
I would never want to do that.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
That sounds like a horrible

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
Twilight Zone nightmare.

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
So never at 42 to hang up

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
your hat from love.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
Oh, you don't mean the doll part?

13:48.000 --> 13:51.000
Well, that doll part's horrible too.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
But I think the funniest part is

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
you have to ask for approval from your accountant.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
Yeah, that's true.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.000
I have financial people

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
so I have to like...

14:01.000 --> 14:04.000
They're gonna notice a charge.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
No, it's okay guys.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
You have to sell them on why

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
you want to spend the money, right?

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
He's gonna ask, why should we justify this?

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
It's not money, but I have to explain to them.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
It's not fraud.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
Not financial fraud.

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
It's emotional and spiritual fraud.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
Certainly.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
There's definitely a heist going on

14:25.000 --> 14:28.000
of the soul.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
And definitely a crime being committed

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
for whichever guys have to haul the crate

14:33.000 --> 14:38.000
up the mountain to my palatial estate

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
where Beth Bootson, now

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
with Unobstructed by Eucalyptus Trees,

14:42.000 --> 14:46.000
can watch my sweaty head bob up and down.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
Is Beth Bootson your neighbor?

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
Thanks for the muffins!

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
Yeah, Beth is the...

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
This guy doesn't like the podcast.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
I mean...

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
Beth Bootson is like a regular...

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
A regular reference?

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
Well, lately.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
I mean, whatever.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
Let's all thank Ryan Ridley, I guess,

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
for her controlling.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
You guess!

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
That was just my joke.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
My joke is that I mean to people.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
That's my joke.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
It's not just me?

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
No, no, it's everybody. I'm always cranky and mean.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
That's my bit.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
Which makes me a great person.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
You're a great guy.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
I'm thankful to have you in my life.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
Good job, Spencer. Thank you for driving me to work every day.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
It's important.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
Thank you for...

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
I love how I drive you to work every day.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
But you're more than that, too.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
You're a friend.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
Thanks, man.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
As you've noticed, I have six.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
So that's a big deal.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
Spencer, look him in the eye when he says this to you.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
I look him right in the stomach when he's talking to me.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
That's why we made faster friends.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
Yeah, I need too much eye contact.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
Oh, you need a lot.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
Yeah.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
God forbid.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
Alright, well...

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
You know...

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
Our next guest

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
is a real doll.

16:08.000 --> 16:12.000
Real doll.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
Her...

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
Her lifelessness

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
is also part of her charm

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
and is worth a lot more than $6,000.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
No, I've...

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
We got to work with her.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
We did our Harmon Quest,

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
which is a fantasy come true,

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
the show itself, and also getting a chance

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
to work with her.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
I'm sure you guys are big fans,

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
and she was great on the show,

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
and we took the opportunity

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
to cajole her into appearing on the podcast.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
Why don't we bring out

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
our new friend, Aubrey Plaza!

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
Hello.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
Hello.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
Yeah.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
And if you want to drink later,

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
I can make you when there's tongs.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
Thank you.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
Alright, so I know your shtick isn't exuberance,

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
and mine is bad interviewing.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
My shtick?

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
Well, I mean, I don't mean to imply you have a shtick,

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
but...

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
And I didn't!

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
I said your shtick isn't exuberance,

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
and I'm a bad interviewer.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
So, I'm going to push through,

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
and it's all on me,

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
if it's a terrible show,

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
because it's I'm bad at what I do.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
Yeah.

17:40.000 --> 17:46.000
What do you feel about sex dolls?

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
I don't know.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
I just said a movie about a sex robot.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
That's like a sex doll.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
Yeah.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
And,

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
you know, I think they're

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
fucking weird.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
And I think they're creepy,

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
and um,

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
they make me sad.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
The men that use them

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
make you sad, too.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
No, just like the idea of it.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
Not anyone specifically,

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
just like, I don't know.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
Don't you think if a person was like,

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
okay,

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
20 strikes,

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
and every time you go out there,

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
don't you think it's a little selfish of us

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
that we thrust ourselves out there

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
out of loneliness and couple up?

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
And then, like, if we keep on learning

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
over and over again that, like,

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
the same result keeps happening,

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
like, statistically,

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
isn't it...

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
To me, there's something like...

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
Everyone should just go fuck a doll?

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
Yeah.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
Well, like, what about recycling?

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
Like, we used to just throw

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
everything in the garbage,

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
and we'd be like, oh, then it all goes in the garbage.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
And then someone was like, hey,

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
all that garbage didn't go anywhere.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
It's like a big island in the middle of the ocean,

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
and it's like, there's seagulls

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
that are affected by it,

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
or whatever the fuck they said.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
And now we have two cans in all of our homes,

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
and it's become custom.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
Like, somebody has an aluminum can,

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
and they come up to you, and they find you at your party,

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
and they go, I can't find your recycling bin,

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
and you're like, okay, high-roaded asshole,

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
I'll deal with it.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
Like, culture changed, you know?

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
And sexually, aren't we throwing away

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
our sex

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
when we have it

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
with someone else?

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
I don't know. I don't know.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
And aren't we recycling it?

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
I have no idea, man.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
I don't know.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
I know.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
Sometimes yes,

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
sometimes no.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
Okay, well, that's a brave answer.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
Yeah.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
From both of you.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
Do you

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
think that you're crazy?

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
Yes.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
Do you think that you're diagnosably crazy

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
as anything in particular?

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
I don't know.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
I have no idea. Probably something,

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
but I don't think I've ever been tested.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
Really.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
Is there like a clinical apathy?

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
I mean, I don't know.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
My grandmother was crazy.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
Oh, yeah?

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
She went to a mental institution.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
Do.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
Was it a ghost story?

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
She,

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
you know,

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
she just kind of break down.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
She was crazy.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
She would like knock on the walls

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
and saying crazy shit,

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
and they just had to lock her up.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
Do you ever think like,

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
oh, I mean,

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
I can feel that.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
A song coming on?

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
Well, first of all, did you have a...

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
And

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
the

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
the unignorable idea

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
that the walls are more hollow than they should be?

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
No, did you have a relationship

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
with this grandma?

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
Not really, because

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
she was pretty sedated

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
when I was growing up.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
So you heard the legends, family legend

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
about her break down? Yeah, because

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
my mom is one out of

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
nine brothers and sisters,

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
and

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
it all kind of went down when my mom was like

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
eight, so five of them

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
had to go to an orphanage

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
that were under 18, and then the four of them

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
were just like on their own,

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
and so there were just like crazy stories

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
about their whole thing.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
Wait, I got back up through that,

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
because there was a certain amount

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
of your mom's siblings had to go to

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
an orphanage, because there was no parent

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
at all there. Because there was...

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
No, no, no, because my grandfather was

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
sick. Okay.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
What happened to the other ones?

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
Because I was trying to parse all of them. They were older than 18,

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
so they were just like on their own.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
Wow. Yeah.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
And then the five of them

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
got adopted by my foster grandmother

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
who then had four of her own, so then

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
there were nine again.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
But the ones

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
in the orphanage, they were like, ah, fuck them, that would

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
be like 15, and they were like...

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
No, all of them in the orphanage went.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
Which was your mom?

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
Bernadette.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
Bernadette.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
Second from the left.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
Was she an orphanage sibling?

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
She was an orphanage sibling, yeah.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
Okay, so what could you mind taking...

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
If I'm prying, don't tell me at any time, but...

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
I don't know.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
Is this going to be online or something?

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
No, no, no.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
So what's...

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
Take us through your mom's story from there.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
I've never known anybody that was in an orphanage.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
She was in an orphanage in Delaware,

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
a Catholic orphanage, and it was

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
really fucked up. They were like being tortured

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
and they were like, you know,

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
it was not a good situation.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
And so,

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
you know,

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
her third grade teacher,

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
my foster grandmother, like, basically

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
was like, I want to adopt you, and she was like,

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
I'm not going without my brothers and sisters,

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
because they were all trying to run away and all this stuff.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
And so then my

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
foster grandmother, the third grade teacher,

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
just adopted all of them.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
And then had four of her own.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
So that means that reading between the lines here,

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
that teacher

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
who you knew as your grandmother,

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
she was teaching

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
some kid who

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
she was very fond of and who was clearly

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
suffering abuse

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
at home, i.e. an orphanage.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
Like, your foster grandmother

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
didn't work at the orphanage, she worked at

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
just like a public school.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
And she was like, you're great.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
What the fuck is going on?

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
Yeah, she just kind of fell in love with her.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
And then she's like, I got to get you out of here,

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
and your mom did the old sitcom

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
cast

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
contract and said, not without my

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
sign files.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
She was my third grade teacher, too.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
The grandma was?

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
Wow.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
Geez, that must have been

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
when you were like, oh, I didn't do my homework.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
She's like, okay, well, it's not like I care about

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
my job.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
So I guess it's okay that you

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
fucked off this weekend.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
Yeah. I mean, laziness pays.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
That's why you exist.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
Were the older kids

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
in your guys' lives? Did they come back?

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
Yeah, yeah, they're around.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
Alright, that's cool.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
All nine, all nine?

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
Not all nine, no.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
One of them died.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
Oh, well.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
Yeah, yeah.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
I got no quip for that, man.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
It's not your job to have quips.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
It's not that kind of show.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
Alright.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
He's a substitute,

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
as usual.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
But to answer your question,

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
I think about it every day.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
The sex now thing.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
Yeah.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
I knew if I did a little digging.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
But are there...

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
No, you think about it every day that

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
chemically...

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
I didn't want to give that short shrift.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
You think about it every day that there may be

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
a little...

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
You've made it this far, statistically.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
Yeah, but, you know,

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
I don't know what's going on, just in general.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
I don't know.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
I don't know what's going on.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
Somebody tweeted at me today

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
like, oh, you do this, this, this and that.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
You might have borderline personality disorder.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
And I'm like, okay, I'll add that

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
to the list.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
No one has ever said that to me.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
I was looking it up and I was actually thinking,

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
oh, Aubrey's the guest tonight.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
This is actually kind of interesting because

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
nowadays, online, you can just

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
look it up and you can just diagnose yourself.

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
Let me type it in.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
Sorry, what was that?

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
Talk about what

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
Parks and Rec was like for a second.

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
Man, Amy Poehler is

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
a dream.

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
Not to make it to him.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
What are you doing? You're diagnosing me?

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
I was going to ask you a couple questions.

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
Oh, okay.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
I did have a stroke when I was 20.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
Oh, wow.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
Really? Wait, talk about that.

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
Well, it just

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
related to brain.

26:30.000 --> 26:34.000
And that's something I think about a lot too.

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
Just like, is it going to happen again?

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
Yeah, how did it happen?

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
It can happen at any moment.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
Where were you when it happened?

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
I was in Queens

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
and I was going to,

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
I've told this story before, so

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
whatever.

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
Welcome to Harmontown.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
I was in Queens and I went

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
into my friend's apartment.

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
I was going to have lunch with them.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
I was 20 and nothing weird

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
was happening at all.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
And I just, in mid-sentence,

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
I was talking about a Hillary Duff

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
concert that I had taken my little sister to

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
the previous evening.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
That'll do it.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
You're drawing the wrong conclusion

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
from this, Ryan.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
After I said the words Hillary Duff,

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
I had a stroke.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
I'm not kidding.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
God damn it, I did a real, I was like,

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
what is this thing?

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
Wait, but what happened?

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
You blacked out?

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
What happened was the stroke was in my left

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
temporal lobe,

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
which means that it affects

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
the right side of my body.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
So my right arm was like completely

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
numb.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
Not numb, but it was just like it wasn't

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
connected to my body.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
I was confused.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
I didn't know what was going on.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
And then I had expressive aphasia for

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
me.

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
And if you were talking to me,

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
I would understand what you're saying inside,

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
but I wouldn't be able to respond.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
Or write.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
Because the blood clot was in my

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
language center.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
All right, wow.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
We've had people on the show

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
that we have a friend who comes back

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
who's survived multiple aneurysms,

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
and he's sort of waiting

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
for the day because they haven't

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
figured out any solution to it.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
Yeah, I mean, you don't really know

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
why that stuff happens.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
It's so terrifying to me.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
But it's also like if you were smart

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
emotionally, which I'm not, and I'm sure

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
the people that you have had

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
gone through this stuff are,

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
you would just accept the invitation

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
that, okay, you can't control anything, so

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
why not just be yourself?

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
Just fuck it.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
Just eat that cookie.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
Just eat that cookie.

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
That's what I'm talking about, eating that cookie.

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
Yeah.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
That's what I do, eat that cookie.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
That's right.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
Give me that cookie.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
I'm thinking about getting a cookie,

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
like a fake cookie from a website that

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
sits on a plate, and it's just like

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
it's made out of silicon

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
and I can just like nibble on it.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
But it's like, isn't that

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
the responsible thing for me to do?

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
That's a person

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
who's been on a lot of diets.

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
Like, you guys

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
can judge me, but the truth is, you're the bullies.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
What do you do

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
like, when people

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
tweet you,

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
like, I'm sure people just tweet you

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
and go like, your piece of shit, fuck you.

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
I just want you to like,

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
like, they,

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
they,

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
that's, I'm positive,

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
I'm positive about this.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
No, I'm sure they tweet that at everybody.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
I'm saying like, but it's like,

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
because what I get, I get like tweets

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
actually based on like, my behavior,

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
like, for you, you could like,

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
write it off and go like, well, I'm famous

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
and I'm an actor and it's like,

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
why would I ever respond to this? And also this person

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
is just being mean and just wants to do

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
the opposite of what they perceive

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
the camera doing to me, which is making me powerful

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
and interesting and they just want to like,

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
drag me down and it's like, pretty easy to write off,

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
I would think. But I,

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
for me, it's based on me being an asshole,

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
like, and doing wrong things.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
But what I don't understand is, when people

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
read at you and go,

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
they have 140 characters,

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
so like, 30% of the tweets I get,

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
they like, take you through the journey

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
of them not liking you. Like, they

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
lead with like, I was a, I was a big fan.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
I like your shows

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
and I like this and that

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
or whatever. But

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
after that thing you did,

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
like, now,

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
I hate you. And I,

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
I hope you're happy.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
And then I just like, I do a tweet

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
back and go like, what?

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
You respond to that? Yeah.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
And

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
how? Yeah.

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
I responded to a girl today.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
She did that and I said, I said,

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
you kind of like it a little bit.

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
Well, I kind of like, I feel like, I feel

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
like, I like, I like the people

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
that like, try to hurt me

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
because I feel like

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
there must be something that they

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
could like, reach,

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
you know, that's like, not like,

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
I need to reach because I don't like

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
feel like I don't like feel like a sociopath

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
sometimes. So I feel like, like

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
when somebody's like, hey fat fuck,

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
you're untalented or whatever, I'm like,

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
well, that feels like nothing, but I'd like to

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
talk to you for a second. Like, don't you think like, if

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
you could like, like, do you? You've piqued my interest.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
Yeah. Do you notice like, where the seam

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
of the armor like is right there? Like, you're

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
aiming for the bat logo, but like, think about,

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
think about here.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
Like, like, and I'm kind of like, but

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
I don't really know where it is because if I knew where it is

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
I would like dig in there and like, reach around.

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
But like, I'm like, come on, like, like, come on,

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
just look, look, come on, find it.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
Like, like, why are you saying that?

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
You know, it's like, so it's like

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
half couch to like defensiveness and then half

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
and like, has it ever turned into

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
a deep friendship?

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
Have you ever gone down that path

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
so long that you realize

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
we're just the same?

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
You and me? I don't, I don't think so.

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
Aren't we all same?

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
That would be,

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
that would be the

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
world's greatest defense for when people

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
ask me why I do it, why I bother to

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
engage. But, but here's a, here's a,

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
here's a good reason why I did it, because

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
sometimes it reveals like amazing, like, Jacques Cousteau

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
life under the Twitter see,

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
because this, this young lady tweeted me

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
today, she did that, she took me through her little journey

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
of liking me and then not liking me.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
And I said, thank you.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
That was, that's really interesting, like how

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
you went through that and like,

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
I'm sure that if you were living my life,

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
like you would do, you so like,

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
like much more gracefully and tactfully

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
or whatever. And I didn't

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
ask her anything, I didn't, I just responded

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
and then she wrote back,

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
she's like, I don't know

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
to, to

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
maybe be a good person,

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
to maybe apologize

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
and I was like, wait, she's not even,

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
this doesn't even make any sense and then I realized, holy

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
shit, she hallucinated me asking her

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
what I should do.

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
And I was like, whoa, this is amazing,

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
like you should look at this, like you hallucinated

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
someone saying, what should I do, lady?

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
Like, like that, like, like,

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
that means that no one ever-

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
I have no idea what you're talking about.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
It stops.

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
Understanding.

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
I'm sorry, what was, what was she

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
hallucinating about?

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
So, so she said,

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
you're a piece of shit, whatever.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
And then I said, thank you very much.

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
Like, that's very interesting.

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
Goodbye.

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
And then she said, I don't know

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
to maybe apologize

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
or something.

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
And I was like, why did she do it?

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
I was like, holy shit, you made up

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
in your brain, you made up

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
that I asked you anything

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
because no one

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
ever asks you anything.

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
You just said thank you.

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
And so she was just like, oh, I thought this was

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
going to be not only a conversation

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
or an argument, but specifically one in which

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
someone defensively says,

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
what do you want me to do?

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
Because she, like, no one ever says to her

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
hey, Daphne, what do you want me to do?

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
Yeah.

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
Like Quentin Tarantino in Dust Till Dawn

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
when he's talking to Juliet Lewis.

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
I mean, it's, it's

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
if you, if the-

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
He's like, all right, I will. She's like, what?

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
You will what?

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
All right.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
I really wanted to find this

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
borderline personality disorder

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
BPD

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
also known as emotionally

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
unstable personality disorder.

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
I mean, give me a break.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
It's a cluster B

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
personality disorder.

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
I mean, is there a disorder called

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
being a doctor?

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
That where the symptoms are being full of

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
shit and trying to act like you're not.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
The essential features include a pattern

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
of impulsivity and

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
stability of behaviors

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
interpersonal relationships

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
and self-image.

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
Check. Yeah.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
Everyone in Los Angeles.

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
The pattern is present by early adulthood, blah, blah, blah.

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
Other symptoms usually include intense

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
fears of abandonment.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
Do you have fears of abandonment?

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
Um...

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
Yeah.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
Raised by orphans. I don't know.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
Like I had to be handed down to you a little bit.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
Maybe.

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
Can I get in on this?

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
You want some of that?

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
No.

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
All right, all right.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
No fear of abandonment.

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
Trying to abandon me.

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
See if I fucking care.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
Oh, shit.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
All right. Welcome to the Ryan Ridley

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
show.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
That's what I'm talking about.

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
Spencer?

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
Let's just do the Grandma's

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
virginity podcast.

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
Oh, we got a fan. All right.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
I've never heard it.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
What happens in that?

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
Well, you know, me and Justin Roiland of the

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
Rick and Morty show. All right.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
Congratulations.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
I guess...

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
I guess we found out I have a fear of...

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
I'm a control freak.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
Uh...

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
Yeah, I don't have a fear of abandonment.

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
I'm trying to search myself. I'm like, I don't know.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
Because I do get very lonely.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
Kind of.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
But I also have...

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
I kind of wish...

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
Could someone please abandon me?

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
I remember...

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
One of my earliest memories is...

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
nursery school.

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
Whatever you call it.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
It was daycare.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
It was part of a bowling league that my mom was

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
playing in Milwaukee.

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
And the women would bowl

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
in this women's bowling league.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
So I'm not being sexist. They were all women.

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
It's not a stereotype that women bowl.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
It was a league.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
They checked back then.

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
There wasn't the transgender

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
awareness then.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
And to put their kids in like this

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
just room at the bowling alley.

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
And that's where that girl stuck that

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
crayon in my mouth.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
Ah, yeah.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
Yeah. Deep cuts of memory

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
from the show.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
So there was one day when everybody was like...

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
Because I would just hide.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
The girls would stick crayons in your mouth.

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
That happened more than once?

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
Well, okay.

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
I pluralized it to make it more effective.

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
No, it happened once. The girl stuck a crayon in my mouth.

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
But what happened

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
all the time was... What color was it?

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
Red. Like purple.

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
Deep, dark, purple.

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
Like dirty.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
Like dark.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
Like if you showed me, if you open up

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
a 64 color crayon...

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
Magenta.

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
Is that dark though?

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
Like a burgundy, deep, dark, purpley red.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
Okay.

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
I'll never forget the taste

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
and the smell. And I was like,

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
ah!

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
But also then there was like six big wheels

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
and there was like 50 kids.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
And then we got like, okay,

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
you can play with toys and everyone run over the big wheels.

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
And I was just like, I just can't take it anymore.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
I can't take it.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
Just like go sit

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
in a cupboard.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
Find a corner.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
Or a hole or something. I'll just sit.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
And is it something like being asked

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
questions in gym class

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
if you want to be left alone?

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
But you have to hide. Otherwise they'll go like,

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
what are you doing? What's going on over here?

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
This is, gym can help.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
And it's like, you want to avoid the whole conversation.

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
So if you could just disappear,

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
you would just disappear.

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
So I did that successfully once.

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
And I remember it was such a pleasurable memory

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
that all of a sudden

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
daycare was over

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
and everybody packed up.

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
Everybody was like, okay, we got to go.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
And all the moms would come at the end of the love boat

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
or whatever, or the end of meatballs.

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
And everyone's like paired up with their parents.

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
And I just kept sitting there.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
I was like, I don't think my mom's here.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
And I just stayed there.

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
And then they turned out the lights

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
and shut the whole thing down.

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
And then I was alone

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
in the daycare room.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
And it was dark.

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
And I just walked around and touched the tables

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
all melancholy.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
I always thought I was in a movie.

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
So I was like, la, la, la.

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
I was hearing a soundtrack in my head.

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
Nobody loves me.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
But I was into it.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
I liked the feeling.

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
I was abandoned.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
I liked it.

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
And then the doors opened after five minutes of that.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
And my mom was like, where were you?

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
And I was like, fuck this.

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
So no, I don't think

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
no fear of abandonment.

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
I think I like it.

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
Extreme anger and irritability.

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
I mean,

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
everybody gets angry.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
But the reason for which others have difficulty understanding.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
So I feel like

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
every time I get angry

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
it's

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
for a perfectly good reason.

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
But based on other people's reactions, I feel like

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
I get

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
a little irritable

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
from time to time.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
Alternating between high positive regard

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
and great disappointment.

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
Self-harm, suicidal behavior

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
and substance abuse are common.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
I don't self-harm

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
or suicidally behave.

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
Disorder is recommended.

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
All right, yeah.

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
Borderline personality.

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
Yay!

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
We saved them.

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
But nobody has anything, right?

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
What do they try?

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
Those are just packages.

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
Those are just for dumb doctors.

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
If somebody comes in and goes like,

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
well, I ate a fire hydrant yesterday.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
And I

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
want to have sex with a graham cracker.

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
And I hate my mom,

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
but I hate her because

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
she won't kill me.

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
And the dog's talking to me.

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
And I stutter.

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
And my left armpit

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
smells like an onion and my right smells like

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
a licorice.

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
And then the doctor goes, Jesus Christ,

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
this guy's going to fuck up.

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
And then he takes the book and it goes like,

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
well, does one of his armpits

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
smell like licorice? And he's like, yeah.

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
And he's like, give him this pill.

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
And he's like, here, take this pill.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
It's all bullshit, all these packets.

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
The diagnoses are just packets.

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
Yeah, I didn't

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
grow up

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
taking a bunch of pills.

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
No one gave me a bunch of pills.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
Oh, no, I didn't. Yeah, I didn't imagine so.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
Well, I was just

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
offering that.

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
Do your relationships last

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
a long time?

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
Yeah.

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
Like, what is a long time?

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
Like five, six years.

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
That is a long time to me.

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
I've never made one last longer than two years.

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
Oh, is that right? Yeah.

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
How old are you? 42.

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
I should have a

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
sex doll.

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
I would be a hero. Whatever you want.

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
I would be a hero for having one.

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
Yeah, get one.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
Yeah, thank you.

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
I can tell my accountant

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
you said

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
get one, right?

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
It's not going to hurt you.

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
I'll just say Aubrey Plaza told me.

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
Yeah.

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
I don't even have a car.

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
By the time I get a Tesla,

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
I could have sorted out all my problems.

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
Why don't you get this Tesla already?

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
I might not need it.

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
Tesla is a symbol.

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
For a fraction of the price,

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
I might become a healthy enough person

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
to drive a hatchback

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
of some kind.

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
The sex doll might itch a scratch that's

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
alright.

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
Well, I told you it would be a bad show.

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
Do you want to talk

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
about the thing in the sky everybody

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
saw last night on The Aliens?

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
Wait, what?

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
It was a rocket test.

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
Oh, really?

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
Yeah.

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
Noodle LA.

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
Noodle rocket test.

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
They shot a missile

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
from a submarine that doesn't even

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
make sense.

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
They're underwater.

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
That's what we want

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
our enemies to say.

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
I can't believe you don't know about this, Dan.

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
No, I don't know anything.

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
There was stuff in the sky,

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
but it was just a rocket test.

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
I got caught up, see?

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
A lot of you wasted a lot of time.

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
I could just get my news here.

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
How's Bernie Sanders doing?

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
I listened to a great piece on him

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
on NPR. It was pretty great.

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
They interviewed him.

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
When he's talking quietly, he doesn't even sound

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
ridiculous at all.

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
You think he sounds ridiculous otherwise?

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
Who are you voting for?

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
I'm not voting for people based on the

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
ridiculousness of their voice.

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
I'll tell you that right now.

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
Like, if you want

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
someone to have a more ridiculous voice?

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
It's not the axis on which

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
I'm basing my judgment here.

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
That's what I'm saying. So whose policies do you like so far?

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
I like Bernie Sanders.

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
I like Donald Trump. What can I say?

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
Either one of those,

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
I'm sure would be great.

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
I

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
will say one

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
thing that could be,

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
it's not a statement of admiration at all.

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
It's just a statement of wonderment

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
which we often express about

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
people we admire.

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
This is just wonderment.

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
If I were running for president,

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
the day

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
that I accidentally

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
or on purpose said

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
all Mexicans are rapists.

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
I would go home and I would be like,

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
well, all right. So no president then.

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
So

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
it is

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
amazing to me that the guy

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
that did that is like,

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
okay, anyways. Anyways,

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
he said all Mexicans are rapists.

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
Eight years ago, the guy went, Michigan, Minnesota,

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
Florida.

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
Oh, boy, the gaff.

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
Oh, Dukakis in the tank.

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
Oh, he looks so silly in the tank.

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
What about the tank of

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
genocidal, horrible

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
xenophobia, like the actual,

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
that's not a picture.

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
That's not a perception. He was just like,

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
yeah, they're rapists.

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
And then everyone was like,

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
well, I think they were cheering because they were there for Donald Trump,

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
the press covers.

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
But he was like, then some thing in his head was like,

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
you should probably qualify that.

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
And he's like, I'm sure some of them

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
aren't rapists.

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
Like, there's got to be a couple.

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
I'm sure there's an exception

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
in every rule. And then he, and then the next day

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
he was like, okay, what should I do? Brush

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
teeth,

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
put on shoes,

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
keep running for president.

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
Which is amazing to me. That really

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
is amazing because I threw out

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
my back rearranging my office and the next day

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
I did not go to work.

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
And I was like, sorry,

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
I had a hard time yesterday

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
and it turned out I'm not as capable

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
as I thought I was.

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
So I'm going to lay in bed and play Minecraft.

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
And if I called all Mexicans rapists,

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
I would twist that into a way to play Minecraft.

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
I would

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
stop running for president.

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
And I would think

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
while I was playing Minecraft, I'd be like,

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
the reason I'm doing this is I don't want to confront

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
what I said.

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
I want to wait until it's old

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
and I can sweep it up.

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
He's got a lot of

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
self-confidence.

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
We can all learn from that.

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
It's true, I do kind of admire him for that.

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
Oh.

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
That doesn't surprise me at all.

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
He has too much.

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
He has a problematic amount

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
of self-confidence.

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
Some would say if he had less, he'd be a lot better off.

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
Just a few.

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
Also, we need new words for confidence.

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
How can he be better off?

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
He's a billionaire who's running for president just for fun.

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
He doesn't.

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
He's like, I don't really give a shit.

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
I'm just going to spend my own money, do this for a little bit.

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
How much more?

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
He's like the best person

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
there could be, right?

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
He just wants to see how far he can take it.

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
Yeah.

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
He's been running for a long time.

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
That's true.

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
What's he running from?

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
We've already talked about this, the fact that

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
it's been looked at based on what

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
he was born with at the starting line

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
and based on what he has now.

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
He's not a successful person.

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
If you were a dishwasher...

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
What was he born with?

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
He was born with lots and lots of money.

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
He's a rich little baby.

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
Then he only lost some of it

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
and then lost a bunch of it.

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
Then he made a bunch back.

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
If you were a dishwasher, he wouldn't have been

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
allowed back in the kitchen at a certain point.

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
But you can't get fired from being a billionaire.

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
They're just like, oh, you're back.

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
And it's like, yeah, I'm back because I'm awesome.

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
And they're like, me too.

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
I haven't researched it, but that's basically it.

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
Do you think voting matters?

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
Yeah.

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
You get excited about it?

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
A little bit, yeah.

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
I don't know.

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
Do you keep your voting to yourself?

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
Yeah.

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
You like to go in there and do a discreet...

48:38.000 --> 48:42.000
You're a cloak.

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
No one can see my eyes.

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
So you don't talk about...

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
You don't share your process with anybody.

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
No, I know. Only myself.

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
How do you pick the circuit court judges

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
and all that bullshit?

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
Eenie meenie miney mo.

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
Uh-huh. I go with names.

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
Cool names.

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
Yeah.

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
They give a little bio next time.

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
They give a little fortune cookie next time.

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
Yeah.

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
I was like, he wants feet to be illegal

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
and just...

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
like, wigs to be hats.

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
And they were like, no.

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
I'll look that up later.

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
But it's got my vote.

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
I think in like 20 years,

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
I'm going to really start caring about those guys

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
and being ready November 3rd

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
with everything.

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
All the information.

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
Really, the only government that matters

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
is the local government.

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
Because where you put a stop sign

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
or whether or not your community is functioning

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
is actually the important thing.

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
We should go to one of these Los Feliz

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
neighborhood council meetings.

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
Yeah. You listen to those Santa Monica ones

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
on the radio.

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
Oh, boy.

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
I'm like, okay, Mr. Frazzles,

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
what do you have to say?

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
The buses are talking to me.

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
You have a right to feel that way.

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
Moving on.

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
What is the...

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
What are we going to do?

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
Aubrey Plaza.

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
About climate change.

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
That's my number one issue.

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
Let's talk about it.

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
Um...

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
I don't know.

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
We all got a band together.

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
And, uh...

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
I don't know.

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
I don't think...

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
I don't know.

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
I don't know.

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
I don't know.

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
I don't know what we can do.

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
Okay. We're fucked.

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
I heard, you know, the rainforest

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
is pretty much dead at this point.

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
Like, if we don't today start

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
undeforcing,

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
reforesting,

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
the forest is just going to be gone.

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
Like, we can't just stop now

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
and it'll heal itself.

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
It's fucked.

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
And then the whole of global warming

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
will just go off the deep end

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
because there's no rainforest

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
that's been regulating this whole process

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
for millennia.

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
Yeah. And the oceans, too.

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
They're going down.

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
They're going up.

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
The oceans are going up.

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
Like, I've read three things

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
in 20 years and I know

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
you're wrong. You're saying the opposite.

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
The sea level is rising,

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
but the fish are all sinking to the bottom.

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
These corpses.

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
Fish float when they die.

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
Who said that's wrong?

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
Fish float when they die.

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
It's all a metaphor.

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
What do we really think is going to happen?

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
It's just going to be like, okay, so

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
there'll be

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
because it's kind of, it's just so many

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
variables because, like, the thing that

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
panics me is, like,

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
sea level, because

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
the scientists talk about, like, okay, the sea level

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
is going to do this and the ice caps are going to do that.

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
But as soon as that stuff

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
has the potential to affect

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
the dollar, then everything's

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
just going to collapse. And it won't be

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
it won't be because the ocean is high

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
that, like, you're

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
like wearing armor made out of

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
bottle caps. Like, you're, you're, it'll

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
be because, like, everything just

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
went to shit and the cops started

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
showing up to work or started hunting people

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
and, like, like, like

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
nothing worked anymore and there was no

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
jobs and everyone was just, like, riding around

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
a wasteland going, like, yeah!

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
What do we

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
have here? I'm an

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
arch-character. I worship what I fear.

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
I'm a denizen of the wasteland.

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
I'm

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
comfortable here. I don't

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
show that I'm afraid of it

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
or I'm not. Maybe that's

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
been, I mean, it only takes two generations

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
to leave the gene pool.

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
Perhaps all the people that were

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
afraid are dead and only the

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
people that were

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
confident in the post-apocalypse

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
are, they just kept

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
reproduced and I'm

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
their progeny.

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
I'm a man

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
of impulsiveness

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
and I love living.

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
I have borderline personality disorder.

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
Excuse me. Is that kind of already

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
happening? Yeah, I mean

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
it is. Just, like, slowly, though.

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
It's not, like, one day that'll happen

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
but it's just, like, happening really slowly

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
and we're kind of, like, seeing it

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
and then we just, like, get used to it.

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
So by the time it happens, we'll decide

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
what's happening. I have been

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
seeing a lot of orange mohawks lately.

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
And, like, one chain

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
across the chest.

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
But, like, you know, it's true, I mean,

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
when you look at the, like, there's always

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
crazy things that we always talk about. We go,

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
like, that's so crazy but it's, like, well, it's not

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
crazy if the end result is, like,

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
Mad Max because the idea that

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
we have a quarter of the population

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
in prison, like, like,

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
I can't remember, I can never remember that statistic.

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
It's, like, the, what is it,

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
what is the quarter thing? It's, like,

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
it has something to do with how much

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
of America's population is

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
in prison versus how much of the,

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
I can't remember the statistic. A quarter.

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
Well, it's, is it a quarter of the world's

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
prisoners are in American

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
prisons? Yeah. That's what it is.

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
Yeah, that's a lot. I mean, so, like,

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
and we're, like, the country that was, like,

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
hey, everybody, be free

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
and do what you want. And so it's, like, okay.

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
And then, and then, like, everybody that's, like,

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
we're, like, okay, that guy makes me uncomfortable.

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
We'll just put him on a timeout. And they're, like,

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
let's put that guy on a timeout. Okay, let's put

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
that on a timeout. And then, like, a quarter of

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
the world is going, like, this is a fun timeout.

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
Like, like, I'm going to learn how to do

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
more in here. Okay, I'm back out. Okay, I'm

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
doing more. Okay, you're going back in.

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
And then it's, like, yeah, that's, that's, that's,

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
that's huge. That's crazy. Like, those,

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
those folks are gearing up.

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
They're, they're the, they're the face

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
and the little ones are getting on the big ones

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
backs. Yeah.

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
Let's go, buddy.

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
Master Blaster from the

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
Thunderdome.

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
I could tell you didn't know the reference.

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
No, I got it. The third Mad Max

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
movie.

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
Do you know how to fly a plane?

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
No. Do you?

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
No. Okay.

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
A helicopter? You wouldn't, you wouldn't

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
leave out helicopter if you knew how to fly a

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
helicopter. I wouldn't what? You wouldn't leave

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
out helicopter if you knew how. No, I don't know

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
how to fly anything. Right.

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
Important to start, right?

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
Like, like those are the people that survive.

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
Well, that's what I think. Sorry.

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
I'm a yellow belt in Krav Maga, so.

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
I don't think they have yellow belts in

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
Krav Maga. It's the first belt.

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
Well,

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
that's not impressive of them.

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
That means, that means, that means you,

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
that means you signed the pamphlet about

55:36.000 --> 55:40.000
a big split in the shower.

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
I'm just, I'm closer

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
is what I'm saying. I feel like all you need

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
is like, you know, a helicopter

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
and a weapon.

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
I mean, if you had a helicopter.

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
Like, if you had a helicopter and you started

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
hoarding gas, like if you were, I mean,

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
but I wonder what income level you have to be

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
to have a helipad right now.

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
You have to be a one percenter, right?

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
Like, you can't just have a helicopter.

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
But if you have, that would make me feel

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
really secure. That would be amazing,

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
because you could just start hoarding gas.

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
That would be great.

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
But you, I mean,

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
well, like, is the idea, okay.

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
To fly away is the idea.

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
And just stay aloft, or

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
to find a place where society still exists.

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
Well, obviously,

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
Well, you land somewhere

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
where there's more gas, and then you

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
find that while you shoot zombies

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
or poor people, whatever.

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
If there's helicopter gas lying around,

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
you feel like you're in a great position

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
automatically.

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
If there's what? If there's still refining

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
helicopter gas for you to find just freely

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
wherever you go.

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
Those babies can run on a lot more

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
than you think.

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
That's just your,

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
you just doubled down on that.

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
I can't argue with Aubrey

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
about how a helicopter

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
gasoline works.

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
She knows everything.

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
I want to see a montage.

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
You don't

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
you don't see a world where

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
the world has effectively, or civilization

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
has effectively collapsed, but there's a lot

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
of places around where you could

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
still find gasoline.

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
I feel like if I'm, you know, I'm in the

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
apocalypse, and everyone's in the apocalypse,

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
and people are wearing bottle caps, and shooting

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
at each other because they have nice car hood

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
ornaments or whatever the fuck.

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
Flying around in a helicopter is going to

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
be the best way to get shot at.

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
And they're also very, they're not like

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
armor. It's also the best way to get missed.

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
Well, they're not that fast, I mean.

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
Yeah, but you're way far away and up in

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
the air. Well, it depends on what

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
you're doing with the helicopter, but a lot of

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
helicopters, you know, they're not too high.

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
They're very lightly armored.

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
You could just shoot them down with a cap gun.

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
I wasn't thinking about it like a battle zone.

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
I was just thinking like, you know, natural

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
disasters getting that helicopter

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
flying north.

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
It would work with an earthquake, certainly.

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
I was thinking battle zone, but I guess part

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
of me naively thought that

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
our same worship of

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
celebrity or richness would

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
somehow purvey in that one way, that

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
if you were down here like shooting each other

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
with AK-47s, that a helicopter

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
fly over and you go, I wonder if that's David Hasselhoff.

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
Maybe

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
if I shoot enough people with this

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
assault rifle, I'll be

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
having lunch with him one day.

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
Well, you could just shoot the helicopter

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
and force yourself to have lunch with him.

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
Well, I mean, you're like a life hack guy. I didn't put that together.

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
He reads those

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
life hack tumblers is why he's saying that stuff.

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
I didn't put it together.

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
I thought a helicopter could just go

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
so far up that a bullet couldn't hit it.

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
It can. It's just not practical.

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
Maybe a surface to air missile though.

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
I mean, yeah, bring it.

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
Like, yes, let's go.

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
Yeah, okay, yeah.

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
Bring your surface to air missile out.

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
Please.

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
Wait, wait, wait.

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
If people have those,

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
they don't want to be on the ground.

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
And you know, you got to hit a helicopter right

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
in the jugular.

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
You can't just

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
that thing will bounce right off that.

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
It's like the 90%

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
splitting blades.

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
Like, yeah, it's like, like,

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
most things that you know, it's going to get chopped in 17 pieces.

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
It probably like half of them probably go back

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
down and hit the guy that shot it.

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
One of them will make a little heart

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
and you'll make a necklace out of it.

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
Yeah, absolutely.

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
Same page club

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
about helicopters.

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
Yeah.

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
Well, you guys can have your helicopter

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
and me and Ridley will hang out with our missiles

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
and we'll see what happens.

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
Well, if I have a,

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
no, I'll take a helicopter over a missile

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
because here's what I'd do. I'd fly the helicopter

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
early. I would do it before

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
anybody would thought that shooting a missile was like a good idea.

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
And I would take, because I would go,

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
oh, because that wouldn't be a luxury that you would have

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
if you had a helicopter.

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
So, well, it says on the news that

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
Donald Trump won, for instance.

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
Why don't we just go for a long weekend

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
on a helicopter trip?

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
Like, we do whenever we get

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
nervous. Like, we'll go

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
to the underground bunker

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
like, you know,

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
and then, hey,

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
I'd love to be wrong.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
And you come back and you're like, ha!

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
And everybody's like, how was your weekend? And you're like, ah!

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
I spent it out of town and they're like, did you,

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
did you abandon all of us because you thought

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
it was a good idea?

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
And you didn't call anybody and you thought

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
it was every man for himself and you got in your helicopter

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
and you're like, hey,

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
what's the difference?

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
You know,

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
Bill Lawrence has a beach house.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Like, come on,

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
knucklehead, let's get back to work.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
And by the way, you can get machine guns

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
for your helicopter to shoot at Spencer and I.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
I shouldn't be giving you that

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
tip, but I'm just saying,

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
you're not defenseless up there.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
You're a news chopper.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
Yeah, that'd be hilarious.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Like, I got it.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Like, I go,

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
you would get it used

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
from KTLA

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
or something.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
You could buy used helicopters?

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
Oh, no, you're talking about, this is

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
pre-apocalypse purchasing.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
Yes. Okay, I'm sorry.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Well, I'm never going to have that much money, so I don't know why we're talking about this.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
You guys are,

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
yeah, thank you, lady.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
I don't know why you reacted that way,

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
but I don't know why anything

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
that happened tonight happened tonight.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
Do you think that

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
bug bites are,

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
Aubrey Plaza, do you think that bug bites are,

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
can heal or not heal

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
based on the psychological health of a person?

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
Yes. Actually, when you were

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
talking about that back there, I was thinking about

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
a time when I had a lot of bug bites.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
And you thought it was because

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
you were extra crazy at that time.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
Well, that's good, because

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
I like my therapist and I don't want to

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
stress.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
That's what I was saying. I think I'm under a lot of stress.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
Or it's bed bugs.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
No, not bed bugs. They don't leave

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
bite bites. Oh, they do.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
Well, they leave like, bed bugs are

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
distinct though, right? You lived in New York,

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
you know what bed bugs are.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
I've only, I got bed bugs once in Seattle

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
in a hotel.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
These aren't bed bugs. It'd be all over

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
my body.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
Are there little colorful strings

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
coming out of them?

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
No.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
Are you sure?

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
I feel sure. What's so funny about that?

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
Because I didn't know if I said

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
no if you'd say definitely

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
bed bugs.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
I just, I've never heard that

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
asked about any bite ever.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Isn't that a real, like, psychological

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
like people see strings coming out of them?

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
Yes, it's called Margellans.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
What?

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
Margellan.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
Yeah.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
It's a psychological

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
illusion that you see

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
colorful strings.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
People think that they can pull little

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
neon fibers out of their

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
little bites.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
They've got a head nod in the front row.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
They see them, right?

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
You saw it on TV or something.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
All right.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
Why are you nodding your head like that then?

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
Because she saw it on TV.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
I know, sorry. She does.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
Everybody's doing a terrible job tonight.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
But why strings?

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
You know?

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
It's cosmic DNA, I would think.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
It's just

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
the cosmic serpent.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
It's about a guy goes

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
and does ayahuasca in the Amazon

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
and he realizes that plants

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
have always been talking to people

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
and that's why the Amazonians

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
have aspirin

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
and why

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
they know how to make

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
curare without dying

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
because, like, you could

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
never just trial and error curare

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
because it would, like, kill you,

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
statistically.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
So they think that this guy,

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
because he's tripping on Amazon

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
acid, like, realizes that

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
it's because plants can talk to people

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
on a cellular level

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
through, like,

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
photonic rays.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
I had a theory

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
like that. One time

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
I did a lot of nitrous oxide

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
and I went under

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
and when I came back up

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
I had the recognition that

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
people had a code, you know, like

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
a programming code

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
and it was base four

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
and the four things it could be

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
were the four colors, green, red, blue and yellow

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
and everything exists

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
as combinations of these green, red, blue and yellow

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
and so, like, you know, happiness

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
is like a color and sadness

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
is a color and anything that anyone can do

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
can be represented in these four colors

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
and

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
I had to write it down and I couldn't figure it out

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
and it took me, like, about

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
a week of nitrous to figure out

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
what I was talking about

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
and that's

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
and that's all I got, it's just that

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
it's

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
pretty disappointing

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
but a fruitful

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
research project? I think there's something to it though

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
I think there might be

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
I never knew that you did that

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
I mean, very occasionally

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
it's like a spiritual thing, you know

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
it's like I'll go on sabbatical and do some nitrous

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
were you just doing

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
whippets?

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
like you bought the canisters from the store?

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
oh yeah, that's good stuff

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
you can make

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
a ton of whipped cream

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
you know, you can also make

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
cupcakes using whipped cream chargers

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
you just put

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
the nitrous into the cupcakes

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
and then you can just put them in the microwave

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
this sounds like I'm on nitrous right now

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
but also you really

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
you're telling us

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
how to use it properly

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
to make cupcakes

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
oh yeah, if you make any

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
cake-like thing, brownies

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
but you infuse it with nitrous oxide

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
it'll cook right up in a microwave

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
real fast

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
soft texture

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
moist

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
you name it

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
I got all sorts of things

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
for all sorts of kinds of people

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
Replaza, do you have any opinions

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
about substances?

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
are you a straight edge person?

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
do you enjoy

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
drugs and alcohol?

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
I have a weed license

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
oh yeah

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
thank you

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
you're supported

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
mine keeps expiring

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
I feel like they

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
they figured out the solution

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
they're arguing

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
about whether to legalize weed

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
and then somebody in the room that pushed it through

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
guys, guys, we'll just make it

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
you have to renew it every year

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
these people don't even get their

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
driver's license renewed

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
it's gonna be hard for them

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
it won't be an out of control situation

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
I know

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
is there ever a moment, because in my mind

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
I'm always waiting for a moment

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
where I can just whip it out

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
and I feel like there's never really

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
you mean when you actually go to buy it?

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
well just when you get a license

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
I'm like in my head

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
I'm like thinking

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
imagining myself on the street

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
like they'd stop you and go

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
oh right now

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
it's like you're smoking a bit of a reefer

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
me going

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
not so fast

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
it checks out

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
but you really ought to do this

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
in the privacy of your home

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
well legally I don't have to

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
well let's not nitpick

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
I'm just a cop

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
well I think you better

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
cop somewhere else

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
swingin' me night stick

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
and wander off

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:53.000
fine

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:54.000
walk away whistling

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
I can still hear you

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
on the other side of the street

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
you're the loudest worst whistler ever

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
it's like 40% air

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
whistling

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
it's not even a song

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
well this is the police station

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
if you keep following me

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
then you're being the weird one

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
I'm going inside to talk to my friends

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
hey you want to come to my house?

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
what the fuck

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
get out of here

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
get the fuck in my house

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:37.000
Jesus Christ

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
I'm obligated by

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
an unknown state statute

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
to go in the house

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
and give you my gun here you go

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
now I'm going to make you a pie

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
you better use enough nitrous oxide

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
to make it go fast

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
or I'll take you

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
by the scruff of your neck down to the...

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
but I do always think about that scenario

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
and I don't think it'll ever happen

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
I think the card is like

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
when you buy it

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
I don't even have the card I just have the paper

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
that's certificate?

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
I was so excited the first time

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
I did it in an afternoon but it took all afternoon

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
and I had to go through this dumb

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
it's like California

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
is now the most backward state

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
because there's like four other states that are just like

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
yeah it's just weed it's legal

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
and now we're the ones that did it first

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
but you now still have to talk to a guy

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
in a Cuban shirt with a stethoscope

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
around his neck in a ponytail

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
and they're like what is this stethoscope for

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
it's for

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
surveillance is what it's for

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
it's for people taking pictures of you when you leave work

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
yeah and you have to like

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
I don't know I felt like

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
they were trying to trick me into like

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
admitting I just wanted pot

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
like them of all people

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
they're the ones selling it but I felt like

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
yeah it's humiliating

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
it's humiliating the whole process

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
and I don't want to have to lie

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
those disgusting lobbies where you have to sit

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
and watch those

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
and you fill out the forms and then like

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
your friend is like just do nausea

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
nausea all the way down

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
oh I'm not going to lie but it's like

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
I guess I'm fucked up enough that it was like fun

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
yeah you want to be like we know what we're doing right

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
just give it to me

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
why are you being like that?

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
like why are you acting so weird

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
this is to try to eliminate this

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
the fucking phoniness man

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
not to enhance it

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
yeah

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
we'll get there

James Terrell

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
who's that

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
he's a visual artist who actually

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
is a place at LACMA called the Gansfeld Effect

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
I've done some time in some

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
uh

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
sensory deprivation

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
and I've done a lot of like

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
studies and work in that

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
I believe in it and this guy's a mastermind

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
with it he creates the thing where he says

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
my mother

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
fucking medium is not

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
color it's not paint

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
fucking perception

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
so he challenges you to like

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
essentially go beyond the rim of like

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
what you can do

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
perceptually so if you stand at the edge

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
of this guy's thing at LACMA

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
you literally lose your

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
perceptual self

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
and I've uh

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
cause you're looking at a

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
an exhibit or you're not

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
imagine literally

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
looking into the void

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
okay got it

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
we've been there

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
no reason

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
one second got it okay

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
okay no time no space

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
no uh but the reason this guy's a

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
mastermind is he takes us to the void

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
and then like literally we're like

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
plunged into a pink like abyss

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
can't find our way out and then like

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
finally like realize that like our perception

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
is like something beyond our body

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
it's a revelatory

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
gift that we're given and

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
we walk out of uh

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
the experience a little bit different

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
that was a fucking flow

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
I just want to make that clear

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
and also audience people can come up to

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
oh do you

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
you know who is here

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
do you want that

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
do you want to just be on the show

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
talk

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
tell us you're racist

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
why are you racist tell us

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
I'm not racist

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
give me the mic

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
you know what

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
you should love them

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
shameful

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
you should be ashamed of yourself

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
and the fact that you won't even admit it

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
that's the fucked up thing

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
to drag it out of you

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
like be honest

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
about how racist you are

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
guy in the front row

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
hold on a second

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
just give me a second

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
okay so

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
we did that

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
I thought I had something on my mind

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
I think we should

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
let's

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
you got a heart out

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
you got to take off

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
I don't know

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
the next thing we do is we play that game

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
you played with us on

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
how you played on Harmon Quest

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
I don't know about that

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
you had enough of that when you did that show

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
I got an early morning

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
anything you want us to look out for

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
when you're

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
as you leave us

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
if we wanted to consume more Aubrey Plaza

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
any book

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
or comic book

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
or anime

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
or special orthopedic shoe

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
or short film

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
no I got nothing

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
well you said you had work in the morning

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
so

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
I'm going to be in a movie

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
that comes on January

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
called Dirty Grandpa

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
oh

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
where I have sex with Robert De Niro

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
oh shit

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
is that what he does in the intern or does he just hang out

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
I didn't see that

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
okay I mean either

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
I saw the commercials and it just looks like he just goes to work

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
but

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
your movie makes more sense

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
there's a threshold

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
in the trailer it would be like oh it's an old guy

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
and he's like oh it's me and then in the 30 seconds

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
he's like yeah but then

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
then the

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
well he's an intern

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
so he just gets food

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
yeah and he's old

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
right but he doesn't just play a grandpa and dirty grandpa

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
okay but it's not called dirty intern

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
okay you know what

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
Dan you don't want to ask what it's like to film a love making scene

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
with Robert De Niro

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
I don't think you get that opportunity very often

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
and I'm assuming

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
alright well it's been asked

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
I mean if you want to answer it Aubrey before you go

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
I think she's going to say I don't know

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
no I know

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
oh okay

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
I know

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
alright

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
um

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
you know it was very

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
interesting

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
I uh

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
at one point

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
I put his entire nose

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
in my mouth

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
on it really hard and then I threw him down on the bed

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
and it just started gushing blood all over me

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
wait what

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
that's not in the movie though

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
is it going to be in the blooper reel

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
and credits

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
I don't know

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
his nose ended up in your mouth on accident

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
you were like sucking on it because you're like

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
you're such a dirty grandpa and you're like into the

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
scene I was just trying to be creative

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
and then

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
some unexpected movement happened and his nose

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
like broke in your mouth or something

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
I don't think it broke

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
I set some kind of

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
geyser off

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
you squeezed loose some kind of

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
did you freak out because you

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
made Robert De Niro a best blood

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
I would too

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
it was weird it was awkward

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
and then he

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
he just yelled for an ice cube

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
can I get an ice cube

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
can I get an ice cube

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
can I get an ice cube

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
can I get an ice cube please thank you

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
can I get an ice cube

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
did he say it like that where he repeated it

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
a lot did you apologize

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
profusely no

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
not really no really

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
why I mean

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
it wasn't

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
I don't know maybe it was my fault

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
maybe I should have apologized

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
I don't know I was just

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
you know

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
in character

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
but he wasn't

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
he was like I don't know

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
he wanted an ice cube

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
and then he was probably grateful

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
just for the experience

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
he's a sweet

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
older man and he's happy to be out there

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
working with the kids

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
and that's

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
the story he has now as long as he didn't endure

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
any permanent harm

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
he's probably happy it happened

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
yeah I don't know

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
it probably didn't even hurt

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
I get nosebleeds all the time

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
I don't feel any pain

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
you should let yourself off the hook

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
yeah I was just trying to

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
come up with some interesting

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
anecdote about it

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
did you make it all up

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
was the whole thing made up

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
no it's true

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
it happened

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
you're saying I should have picked a peek

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
of their reaction and said

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
no no

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
but how do you

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
no I just

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
you know it was a weird thing that happened

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
so I just thought I'd tell you about it

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
it's the kind of thing you

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
talk about on a talk show right

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
yeah you know like right now

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
but Kimmel would know

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
what to do with it

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
to be honest

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
yeah

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
yeah and I don't you know

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
that's not gonna hurt me you saying that

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
I don't consider myself a competition

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
with him

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
I think that what I do is more

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
art than science

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
I think he's more of a scientist

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
did he like

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
did you have any interactions with

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
DeNiro I mean even before you bite his nose

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
and have it spout blood into your mouth

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
it's already weird just to meet him on a set

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
yeah it was weird

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
what's your first interaction with him

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
like does he like come out

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
in a bathrobe and go

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
yeah he goes you want to do this

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
you better do this

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
you want to act with me

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
and then he said yes

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
I don't know

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
we didn't talk like I didn't

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
you know we didn't like braid each other's hair

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
right

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
did you see his nose as a cartoon

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
roast chicken when you first met him

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
yeah

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
but in the movie

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
is that the only scene

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
literally like he met you

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
and then you guys were doing this scene

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
no the whole movie

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
is like I'm a supporting character in the movie

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
and throughout the movie

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
it's just like

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
his character is like I'm gonna fuck you

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
and I'm like I'm gonna fuck you too

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
and then

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
we don't until the very end

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
so it's like a build up kind of thing

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
a little spoiler

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
I mean we already know he's a dirty grandpa

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
from the title

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
a dirty dirty grandpa

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
it's not like he says I'm gonna do something to you

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
and you're like I can't wait to find out what

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
are you supposed to not

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
think it's really gonna happen

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
I don't know

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
I'm not sure I don't have

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
perspective on that

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
well nobody listens to this anyway

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
speaking of which you said in the green room

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
you're gonna be on criminal minds

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
that's what I'm shooting right now

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
well I don't know

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
well it's not like I care but I don't want to

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
it's not like you're gonna ruin their show

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
I don't know how television

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
works in terms of ruining

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
anything

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
I spent six years trying to figure it out

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
and then they were like TV's dead and I was like

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
I just got started

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
you're playing a serial killer on criminal minds

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
which was the show that Patrick Brewster was on

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
apparently

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
and it's been on CBS for a million years

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
11 years

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
and you're gonna serial kill people

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
tomorrow is my last day that's right

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
oh that's why you gotta get up

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
yeah that's why

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
you also like

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
I was like now you gotta go

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
oh yeah that's the

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
that's the alarm that's her heart out

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
you

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
you do

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
an amazing Sarah Silverman impression

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
that I won't make you do because

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
you don't like to be pimped to do impressions

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
right

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
no but that it's so weird that that is still

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
like because

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
the time at which I did that

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
it was I was like preparing for my

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
SNL

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
like audition

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
like years ago

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
and at that time when I was doing like

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
you know when I would make like a dumb video

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
or

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
whatever comedy I would like

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
put it on YouTube just to like

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
have it on there

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
in my mind it wasn't like I'm putting it on here

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
so that it goes viral

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
like it was like not well it's a

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
magnificent impression okay yeah

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
it's notable it's also on your tumblr

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
you could take it off right but my tumblr

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
is like how do I take it

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
I don't know I was

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
like so long ago yeah I don't know

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
but that's where I saw it it was like

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
it's linked I know these

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
videos they're just there they're just out

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
there yeah but yeah that was like

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
an impression I did that's right yeah

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
that was long too it's really good

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
and I would urge people to just go

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
look for it because it's a really good

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
Serena Silverman impression and I'm sure it's from

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
yeah I mean yeah I don't know like I never

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
I didn't know her obviously

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
at the time and I never thought in my

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
head that eventually I would like

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
you know know her so

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
yeah it's

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
a total like she's the coolest

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
all right

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
let's thank Aubrey Plaza for coming by

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
thanks for having me

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
bye

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
she's being taken to the

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
Harmontown helicopter on the roof

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
where she will be out of

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
rifle range

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
all right so

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
now is the most exciting part of the show

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
we get to spend the next seven minutes

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
figuring out who's gonna play Shadow Run with us

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
now

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
we don't have to base it on gender balance

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
because as you've noticed with this show

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
I've had a lot of female guests

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
solved that problem remember when

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
that was an issue

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
so now we can just base it on

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
what hey oh hello what's up

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
what were you well I was going to

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
maybe see you on a story but oh you're

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
gonna shoe her in a story go ahead yeah

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
I'm debating whether I want to tell a story

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
but I feel like it's I want you to tell a

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
story you have to now

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
so we

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
we just started back to work

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
on Rick and Morty season three

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
hold your applause

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
and we hired

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
for the first time after two seasons

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
all male writing staff

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
we hired four female writers

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
right

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
and there's a little bit

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
of an adjustment period

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
and the other day do you remember this

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
for you in the room the other day we were talking

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
and one of the female writers said

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
very innocently and very

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
naively

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
as if she was talking about a furry

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
or someone who has sex with

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
can openers like she goes

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
oh what if he's like one of those weird guys

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
who likes to come on women's

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
faces and tits

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
and there's a long beat and all this

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
ingestion goes yeah those guys are

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
weird

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
and then his face

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
turns seven shades redder

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
than that solo cop

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
and that's when you realize

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
there's some communication that's gonna

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
have to be bridged

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
there's some differences in perspective

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
and

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
that was a funny moment

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
I was

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
the first day of work

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
there's something interesting about

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
a

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
gender balanced writer's room

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
specifically because it's like

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
you don't spend your

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
once you fall in love with a woman

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
as a guy

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
there's never a point where you

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
you don't do a big Q&A about tampons

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
you don't go like how does the applicator

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
work and all this stuff

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
it's kind of something you can get to 42

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
as I discovered without really knowing

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
it was a field day

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
I was like alright explain

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
we were talking

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
about a story about

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
the possibility of summer doing a vodka

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
soaked

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
the possibility

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
the possibility

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
she's a 17 year old girl

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
the show and

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
we're very hands on

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
about because it's easier to do

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
for guy writers with a 14 year old guy

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
character it's just like

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
we've shown Morty is very much

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
an authentic 14 year old boy

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
like sexually speaking but

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
summer is kind of like

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
we've

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
and I think we were smart to do this and judicious

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
we haven't touched her

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
intimate

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
side at all

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
if it's all male

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
writer's room you just shouldn't

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
I was never going to go there with a 17 year old girl

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
character it'll be like oh then of course

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
then she starts humping a pillow

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
when you start breaking a sweat

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
when you're talking about a story

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
it's probably not going to get a lot of comedy

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
but now we have like half and half

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
full representation of everything so it's nice

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
because we're sort of talking about

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
it's not like we're going to do an episode about vodka

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
tampons but

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
the conversation came up and then it was like

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
that led to holy shit I have

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
95 questions about tampons

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
and I got them all answered within 5 minutes

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
one of them came out

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
and I was like

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
I poked my finger and the thing came out

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
I was like now why is the little head shape

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
like a little penis head

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
oh that's just an accident that's not

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
good

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
imagine all the questions you can ask your sex doll

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
yeah

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
I mean we also

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
talk about other stuff too

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
so

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
it's not why we hired four women

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
they got good ideas

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
and it's not all they wanted to talk about

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
it was a two way

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
it was a collaboration

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
but I liked it I never thought

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
I'd see the day on Rick and Morty

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
community we started out of the gate

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
we had balance

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
gender wise

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
so it was always just that kind of show

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
always just felt because it was a sitcom

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
and it was relatively mainstream

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
Rick and Morty obviously is like

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
it's more of a cult hit

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
there's a boyish

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
energy to it I'm not saying that anyone

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
that's not boyish isn't allowed

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
to watch it I'm just saying like there's definitely

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
a boyish

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
energy to the to the to the show

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
and has always been an all male writer's room

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
and I never thought that's very interesting

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
to have some ladies in there

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
talk about

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
all right

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
when you brought it up you wanted to tie it

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
you thought it was so fucking fascinating

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
I didn't know you were going to turn it to Charlie Rose

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
Jesus

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
I never thought that it would be so interesting

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
to see such gender diversity

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
it's a bad show

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
big deal

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
what's your favorite show in the world

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
I bet they had like eight bad episodes

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
in the last 12 weeks

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
the Jets

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
the Jets that's sports humor Dave

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
I don't get that

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
unless you're talking about there's a show

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
called the Jets

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
it's like the new wings or something

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
I'm just saying like give me a god damn break

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
I'm going through a divorce

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
I'm fucking mannequins

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
I can't come here and have a shitty show

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000
fuck you people

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000
what are you going to do

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
fire me

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
arrest me

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
the word fire me

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
caught in my throat

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
this happens so often

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000
I was like wait don't say that again

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
they could figure out how to fire you

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
what are those people doing on Twitter

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
what do they mean

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
you're a bad person

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
you tweeted wrong

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
what are you going to do now

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
I don't understand what you're going to do

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
why would you

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
how small is your brain

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
that you would be like

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
hey I wanted to let you know

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
that you morally disappointed me

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
that you are

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
a pettier person

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
and I'm letting you know

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000
through Twitter because I'm

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
an arbiter of

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
Twitter cat

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000
you don't get it

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000
I mean I don't know

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000
I get why someone would just anonymously

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
log on and go to Tom Hanks like

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000
fuck you fuckface

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
you get a small dick baby

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
make that like a box of

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
chocolates bitch

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000
I get that

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000
that's vandalism

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
that's like oh if I could just get through

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
these people like really honestly

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
if you hooked them up to a lie detector

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
and said are you just doing that

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000
they would say no I'm not just doing that

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
and the lie detector would not go off

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000
they would be telling the truth

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
they would be like no I'm like

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
I'm a good person

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000
and I'm good at life

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000
and I like this person

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
I read about him on a hashtag

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
or a dot dot dot dot

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
slash

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000
and I clicked over here

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
two cents

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
and there it is there's my two cents

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000
I just don't get it

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000
I've never done that in my life

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000
it's like youtube comments

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000
sure you're not the guy who's writing the youtube comments

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000
but you can't say you don't understand the impulse

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
for anyone who's a fucking idiot

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000
to put those words up there

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
just because that's what they feel like doing

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
in a certain amount of the cases though

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000
I can absolutely say I don't understand

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000
I do not understand

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
they got thoughts they gotta shit them out

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
and have other people that don't understand them

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
but if you're that dumb

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
then you could be honest

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
you don't have to try

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000
no they're not honest at all

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
they're so self diluted

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000
it's like that's the thing is like if I was that dumb

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000
I would just like run around the street

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
and go like pants shoes

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000
did lunchbox sky blue

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000
I'm an idiot

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000
I don't care about anything but myself

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000
cookies and asphalt

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000
boop boop boop boop

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
I'm excited

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000
people do that too though

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000
I don't know it's

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
I was thinking the other day that there's this thing

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000
you know it's like when you exercise

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000
you get all those endorphins going

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000
your body's like I'm doing a good thing

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000
and like you go on rides on an amusement park

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
and it's like adrenaline is good

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
I'm having fun

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000
and like you're getting a fight

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000
and like your blood is rushing

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
and you know you're on this high

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
you're like really intense

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000
like I'm going out to beat the shit out of someone

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
except there's no harm in it

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000
and there's no danger in it

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000
so it's like why would you

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000
if you could pick any fight

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000
and never get hurt why wouldn't you pick fights

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000
you know and I feel like maybe some people are falling into that trap

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000
it just seems like they put so much into it

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
other than just going like because that's the

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000
equivalent of going like boo

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
like you could just go boo

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000
but they like they type boo

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000
and it takes them like 20 minutes

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000
they think yeah that's how they talk

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000
it's like they wouldn't just say boo

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
they'd be like actually

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000
you know what you're saying is

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000
it's wrong if you're in Spain

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000
so keep a note of that

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
next time you're in Spain

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
that's just like that's what their thought process is

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
it's not your thought process

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
but it's theirs

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
it's bad probably but

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
and then a healthy person

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000
aside from going nowhere near twitter

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000
which is like

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000
okay conversation over

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
because what the fuck do I have a laugh

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
because I already go nowhere near reddit

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
I already go nowhere near tumblr

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000
or go nowhere near anything

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
so aside from just this thing of like

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
just don't get online

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
go fly a kite go climb a rock

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000
okay great then the good guys win

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000
like when I'm like throwing a football

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
in the yard

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
and dying of old age with my dogs

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
I'm not online because

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000
like that's great

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000
that's healthy

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
and then it's like

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
so then second to that is like

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000
well don't feed the trolls

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000
so that means okay I know what that looks like

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000
that looks like me going every three hours

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
hey

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000
CISO is coming up

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000
look at this project

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000
hey here's an interview with me

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000
and then I just hire a publicist

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000
to just do that for me

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000
and then they just go like

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000
so then I'm just another account that just goes like

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000
hey where are my tuples at

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
I'm about to eat a

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000
chocolate bar hashtag me

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
if you love chocolate

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
and then everybody's just like meanwhile

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000
they're just going like fuck you fat

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000
fucking fucking shit face

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000
but I'm not on twitter so then the publicist

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000
is just ignoring they don't care

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000
everybody doesn't care that's a great society

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
that's great

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
I shouldn't be angry I shouldn't get mad

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.000
about the idea that I was like born on the internet

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000
and watching it turn into this sewer

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
I shouldn't like

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000
have like a fit of rage about this

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
that's not healthy

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
you should always be unaffected by everything

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000
you should just lie to people

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000
you should never tell anyone your feelings

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000
you should never express your feelings

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000
you shouldn't feel your feelings you should hate the internet

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
you should all use the internet

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
but you should all hate it we should all therefore

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
simultaneously hate

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000
everything that we constantly do

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
let's all live a fucking lie

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000
let's all twist ourselves into a balloon animal

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
where we constantly think

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000
one thing and say another

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000
and we'll enforce it amongst ourselves

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000
by judging everyone who accidentally

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
says like this is fucking

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000
retarded this is insane

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
person I don't like you

stupid person you shouldn't

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000
value television this much and you shouldn't

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000
think that I'm an elected official

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000
to the point where you could like tweet me

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000
and let me know that I'm a bad

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
person and then like I think that something's

he's been like everything he says

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000
I laugh because he's like he's

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
he's been on the show before but you don't know like

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000
every year every day he's always like okay so here's the thing

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
we gotta do this we gotta do that

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
and I go like oh do we have time for that

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000
I think we absolutely do and I go I think

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000
I'm a terrible piece of shit and I should kill myself

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
I don't think you should do that Dan I think the world's counting on you

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000
that's

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000
that's

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
that's Steve's role

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000
in my life this year

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000
but then he has receding

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
gums and he had gum surgery where they

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
like did the kinds of

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000
Mengele things to his mouth and

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000
and he's like healing and he's like

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000
he talks like

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000
I think I should kill myself

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:59.000
and he's like don't don't do that

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
the world

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000
the world's counting on you

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000
that's like it's like getting a pep talk

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000
from Aubrey Plaza

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
like

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000
like I felt a bullet going faster out of the bullet

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000
I thought you said I had a cute voice

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
well I'd say it's adorable that you're

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000
you're so

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
like I didn't realize how much

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000
how based on your voice it was

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000
oh

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000
but then I make jokes about it and then you start

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000
and he does that

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000
I love you

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000
then he starts laughing

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000
and then he can't laugh because it hurts too

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000
I always like that too is it bad of me to

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000
like that that's like you guys ever have a friend

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
who like because of some

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
surgery or something like they can't laugh

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000
and they're like you never like

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000
this is really selfish of us like

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
like we don't like we don't like actively

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
become unfunny when that happens right

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
like like it's fun it's like amazing

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
when somebody is like

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
like they can't laugh and they're like

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
they're like oh don't make me laugh

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000
and you're like god damn it I'm

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000
killing like I'm literally killing

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000
like is it just me

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000
or is it like there's no instinct in your head that goes like

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000
okay all right I'll chill

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000
this week was really hard Spencer

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
sitting next to Spencer makes me laugh all day

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000
and then you came out with like grand slams

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000
all week and tell me about some of them

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000
I don't know

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000
oh fuck but

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000
it was really hard I had

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000
tried so hard not to

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000
I think I broke a couple stitches

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000
definitely tasted blood a couple times

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000
I just when you got it

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
you got it

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
I'm sorry I'm sorry you're in pain

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000
no no that's what it's like working for

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000
one of the funniest people

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000
yeah well I mean

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000

I mean the world there are histories first guest

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000
just left like in the middle

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000
usually like I gotta go

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000
she said she had to leave during whatever

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
no no no I'm

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000
self deprecating I'm just saying it was a joke

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000
land the audience felt the same

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000
obviously is what we learned in that moment

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
it was a bit

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.000

sometimes there's a guy in the back

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000
that's like Liverpool

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000

alright so

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000
when you're not writing 40 years

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000
of classic horror novels

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000
actually actually

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000
that's my role

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000
wait I don't

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.000
oh okay

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000
well obviously that's a compensation

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000
for the fact that without any props you look

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000
identical to a lesser author

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000
lesser author

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000
I'm done here promoting my graphic

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000
I hope Stephen King wouldn't be mad at me

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000
for saying he was alright fine sorry Stephen King

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000

these guys are bummed out

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000
that's what I do I burn bridges

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000
now I'll never work with Stephen King

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.000
it has pictures

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000
so

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000
is this just like the regular book

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.000
but with pictures

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000
that must have been hard

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.000
you drew it and wrote it

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.000
town

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000
after finding the stash of mp3's

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.000
the team found themselves on the run

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.000
from the law for the murder

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.000
of an innocent security guard

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:57.000
the director friend had a plan

01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:59.000
to shake their tail

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:01.000
turn left

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.000
there was the talk of a trip to Tacoma

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.000
but instead the car screeched its way

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.000
back to Hank's last stand

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.000
back at the bar Eve haggled with Hank

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.000
over the price of digital music

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.000
he said six

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:15.000
but due to the possibility of seafood

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000
she heard eight

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.000
wanting to get asses in all seats

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.000
Hank agreed and the team was rewarded

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:23.000
with the job done where will the runners

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.000

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:27.000
and nightblade blossom

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:29.000
will they find the man who tried to pay them

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.000
with a ghoul magnet

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.000

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:39.000
last week's episode on the way here

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.000
and that kind of

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.000
that seems like kind of an old

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.000
nightblade went to the bathroom

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.000
hordegaard

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:49.000
lathered now we're caught up

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:51.000
and then he said

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:53.000
we found a map on the back

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:55.000
of the soap dispenser

01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:57.000
well yeah he's not allowed to do that stuff

01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.000
that's what I said

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.000
and then Jeff said cliffhanger

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.000
are you saying as the game master

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.000
that there's no map

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.000
well I don't know let's ask hordegaard

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.000

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000
which one of you is hordegaard

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.000

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:17.000
I have a sense about it

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.000
it feels

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:21.000
important

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.000
you were so chatty a minute ago

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.000
I'm all about it

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:35.000

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000
mind link with the soap dispenser

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.000
it does not have a mind

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.000
she's standing saying

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.000
someone give me a mission

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.000
hey uh

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.000
you want to talk about something for a while

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.000
go ahead

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.000
we need to

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000
I want to make money

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:29.000
and

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000
I accidentally killed a

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:33.000
person I think in the last mission

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:35.000
and I got a real taste for

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:37.000
for blood

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:41.000
alright

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:43.000
well uh you know typically we don't

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:45.000
make our own missions

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:47.000
we get called

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.000
with one I know all these kooky characters

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:51.000
come out of the woodwork and just throw us in the mix

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:53.000
can we solicit

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:55.000
adventures

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:57.000
we go around the bar and ask anybody if they need

01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:59.000
an adventure a task or anything

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.000
that seems professional

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:03.000
you guys are

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:05.000
currently the only people at the bar

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.000
other than teddy and hank

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:09.000
I leave the bathroom

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.000
and suggest we maybe call

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:13.000
hack guy and see if he knows of anyone

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.000
in need

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:31.000

hack guy

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:43.000
hack guy

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:45.000
what do you want

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:47.000
I'm sitting at the bar

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:49.000
five feet away

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:53.000
it's this viking

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:57.000
do you know anyone that wants to

01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:59.000
take us out to kill a bunch

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:01.000
of people and make some money

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:03.000
no

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:05.000
no I don't know about that

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:07.000
shit

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:11.000
from outside you hear a car

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:13.000
you hear a car pull up

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:15.000
a car pulls up and into the

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:17.000
bar walks a middle aged blonde

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:19.000
woman in a drab uniform

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:21.000
the uniform of a corporate wage

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:23.000
slave

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:25.000
she appears tired from the daily

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:27.000
grind and seems to have gone a few

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:29.000
days without sleep she pulls up a chair

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:31.000
and just holds up a hand

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:33.000
and hank gives her a drink

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:35.000
see

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:37.000
that's how you get a shadow run

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:39.000
I

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:41.000
gymnastics over to her

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:51.000
you somersault

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:53.000
that's the title I think that's the title

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:57.000
neatly over to her

01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:59.000
rise to your feet

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:01.000
at her side

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:03.000
she's startled

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:05.000
I'd say

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:07.000
more startled

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:09.000
what's your name

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:11.000
you don't know don't you try talking

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:13.000
to her

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:15.000
hey

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:17.000
hey I'm real nervous

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:19.000
why

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:21.000
what's your name

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:23.000
my name is Peggy

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:25.000
alright

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:27.000
sounds good to me

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.000
I've not seen you around this bar

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:31.000
before

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:33.000
this is our local watering hole

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:35.000
and we get pretty drunk

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:37.000
here all the time

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:39.000
yeah well I come here a lot

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:41.000
so I don't know how to deal with this

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:43.000
let me touch the chase

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:45.000
I

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:47.000
really want to

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:49.000
fucking help you with something

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:51.000
do you have any like secret missions

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:53.000
right

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:55.000
well that's

02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:57.000
what

02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:59.000
that's just

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:01.000
that's just uncanny

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:07.000
you know I've been busy lately

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:09.000
I've been staying late at work

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:11.000
and also my daughter's missing

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:13.000
it's just rough all over

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:15.000
bury the lead

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:17.000
how old's your daughter

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:19.000
14

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:21.000
you don't know your daughter's age

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:23.000
that's a little suspicious

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:25.000
it's been a couple months

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:27.000
not since I've seen her since her birthday

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:29.000
it's hard to keep track

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:31.000
I'm not following that

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:33.000
I cast Analyze Truth on her

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:35.000
to see if she's telling the truth

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:37.000
cause that's a little weird

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:39.000
she's

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:41.000
yeah she's telling the truth

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:43.000
she's clearly gone

02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:45.000
without sleep she's a bit loopy or something

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:47.000
something's off about her

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:49.000
aura

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:51.000
mind probe

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:53.000
oh man

02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:59.000
you see

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:01.000
all sorts of visions you see ghouls

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:03.000
and support groups

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:05.000
and therapy sessions

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:07.000
and daughters and child's toys

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:09.000
all in a flash it seems

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:11.000
this lady she's lost her daughter

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:13.000
who is a victim of HMHVV

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:15.000
that means she's a ghoul

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:17.000
and has to eat flesh

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:19.000
but she up and disappeared

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:21.000
extra scary cause she might be shot to death

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:23.000
cause you know, zombie

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:25.000
well

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:27.000
I got a lot from that

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:29.000
but we don't know

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:31.000
this is horrifying

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:33.000
I feel like my mind was just violated randomly

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:35.000
this is not why I come to the bar

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:37.000
your life's like an episode of Ninja Turtles

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:41.000
I'll take your word for it

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:45.000
sorry

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:47.000
that was probably me

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:49.000
how do you feel that way

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:51.000
I need another train

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:53.000
next round's on me

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:55.000
well

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:57.000
we'll happily

02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:59.000
help you out with this situation

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:01.000
no listen

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:03.000
that's my friend hordegaard

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:05.000
he's a psychic and

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:07.000
hello

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:09.000
he was probably probing your mind

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:11.000
I don't know what he saw but he's right

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:13.000
you do seem like a troubled person

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:15.000
and

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:17.000
we are a crack troop of

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:19.000
I guess what you'd call shadow runners

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:25.000
I give Jim Nightlade the thumbs up

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:27.000
and I wink

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:33.000
yep those things happen

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:35.000
so you have a missing daughter

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:37.000
and again forgive me for prying

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:39.000
but she is a ghoul

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:41.000
we have some experience with that

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:43.000
and ghoul magnets

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:45.000
so

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:47.000
this one seems pretty cut and dry

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:05.000
I mean

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:07.000
where did you last see her

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:13.000
and let's get the magnet

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:15.000
you left the magnet back at the thing

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:17.000
I threw it

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:19.000
I was angry at the time because it was a ghoul magnet

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:21.000
I wasn't thinking maybe we

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:23.000
needed

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:25.000
for a mission

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:27.000
hindsight 2020

02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:29.000
regardless we're good enough to do it without the ghoul magnet

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:33.000
oh shit

02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:35.000
do what

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:37.000
to save your daughter

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:39.000
lady

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:41.000
sorry this is very disorienting

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:43.000
to have your mind read without saying anything

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:45.000
hey doctor friend

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:47.000
can you fucking like help this woman out

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:49.000
from her whatever just happened to her brain

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:51.000
do you have a healing ability

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:53.000
what does she need like some

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:55.000
what do you need

02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:57.000
aspirin or something

02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:59.000
just you know

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:01.000
some space

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:03.000
not to have my mind read

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:05.000
just to have tons of people offering me

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:07.000
all sorts of things

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:09.000
why don't we all like spread out

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:11.000
and just kind of pretend that we're all

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:13.000
in a bar alone together

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:15.000
and give the lady some space

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:17.000
did I say sorry yet

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:19.000
probably

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:21.000
okay well I give her a space

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:23.000
thank you

02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:25.000
we're going to save your daughter

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:27.000
end of story

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:29.000
let's fucking save this woman's daughter

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:31.000
oh no

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:33.000
sorry it's a little tantrum I throw

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:35.000
um yeah I mean

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:37.000
look do you play darts

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:39.000
anybody

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:41.000
oh what's that

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:43.000
and I just walk away because I

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:45.000
I'm not good at this and I just go

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:47.000
and I get a drink and I go over

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:49.000
to doctor friend and I go

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:51.000
Jesus Christ we fucking suck at

02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:53.000
shadow running like we were

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:55.000
terrible at it

02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:57.000
Mary O'Donnell walks in

02:05:57.000 --> 02:05:59.000
would it be creepy if I

02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:01.000
got her and

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:03.000
bought her a drink

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:05.000
she's been working long hours

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:07.000
are you asking me

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:09.000
I guess I'm

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:11.000
asking the audience

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:13.000
she seems put off

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:15.000
by the fact that everyone's been

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:17.000
cycling up to her

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:19.000
but then again I don't have

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:21.000
any alternative suggestions I mean

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:23.000
I'm literally like fucking

02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:25.000
mannequins what

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:27.000
what if we just ask her

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:29.000
where was the last place you saw your daughter

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:31.000
oh man

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:33.000
she used to be going to these

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:35.000
these these support groups

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:37.000
for zombies I'm sorry

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:39.000
you're called HMHVV survivors

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:41.000
it's cool teaches them how to cope

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:43.000
she used to be going

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:45.000
you know she went every week

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:47.000
she had a lot of good progress

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:49.000
but she didn't come back are they like

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:51.000
in the basement of churches and stuff like that

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:53.000
no they have their own storefronts

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:55.000
like a like a

02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:57.000
real business like Weight Watchers

02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:59.000
do you know who

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:01.000
sponsored of us

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:03.000
no no none of that

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:05.000
what if we go there

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:07.000
it's alright

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:09.000
I'm a bad listener and I

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:11.000
shit god damn it

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:13.000

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:15.000
you got it

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:19.000
excuse me for one second

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:21.000
ma'am

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:23.000
she said her daughter went to

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:25.000
like a weight loss group

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:27.000
a support group

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:29.000
but she doesn't know which one

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:31.000
she was going to many

02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:33.000
she was going to all kinds of but she's a zombie

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:35.000
what was your favorite one

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:37.000
she used to go to flesh to

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:39.000
fresh but

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:41.000
flesh to fresh

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:43.000
I went over to see if she was

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:45.000
still there you know obviously that's the first

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:47.000
place he goes the last place you saw her

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:49.000

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:51.000
they didn't they didn't she wasn't there

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:53.000
the next day place disappears

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:55.000
the whole place disappears

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:57.000
hold on hold on

02:07:57.000 --> 02:07:59.000

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:07.000
she hasn't even given us a job

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:09.000

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:11.000
one of you guys

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:13.000
must have a skill that involves

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:15.000
calming her down

02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:17.000

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:19.000
