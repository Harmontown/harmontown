WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.600
He wasn't ready, now he wants an alibi

00:03.600 --> 00:06.200
He's got a steady job, he's never done it

00:06.200 --> 00:07.800
From Hollywood, California

00:07.800 --> 00:09.400
In the back real of Meltdown Comics

00:09.400 --> 00:12.000
Harmontown is now in session

00:12.000 --> 00:15.000
Yeah, it's so great to die in such a small world

00:15.000 --> 00:16.000
Oh yeah

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
It's so great to die in such a small world

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
Yeah, it's so great to die in such a small world

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
Let's bring out somebody near and dear to my heart

00:24.000 --> 00:32.000
Mr. Spencer Quentin

00:32.000 --> 00:37.000
Oh yeah

00:37.000 --> 00:46.000
And the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harlan

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
Thank you very much, thank you

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
Thank you

00:52.000 --> 00:56.000
Thank you

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
You seem very cocksier tonight

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
I'm a little high

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
I'll be honest with you

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
What flavor of narcotics are you on tonight?

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
Just weed or what?

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
Strawberry cough, I think it's called?

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
I don't know, sativa

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
I'm not, I don't make that my gimmick

01:13.000 --> 01:17.000
It's make that society's gimmick

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
Legalize it!

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
Alright, Nancy Reagan died

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
Maybe that's why I got so high before the show

01:28.000 --> 01:34.000
I feel like a ghost finally stops telling me to say no to things

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
Maybe I...

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
Did you write that joke down, was that prepared?

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
No, I just made the connection, I came out

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
I followed, I told them I'm high

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
They're gonna know sooner or later that I'm high

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
And then I was like, I got one thing to talk

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
Nancy Reagan died

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
You just said yes

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
But then, yeah, okay

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
It's not like you've been saying no your whole life

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
No I haven't, but yet a floodgate did open more

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
Maybe that's what happened

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
Alright, so Nancy Reagan

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
94 years old, rich

02:07.000 --> 02:13.000
So, you're saying foul play

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
The curse of the first ladies

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
They all die

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
All of these women married first men

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
All of them are dropping away

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
And they're 90s

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
Year by year

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
Norma Taft

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
You know, you want to be a great serial killer

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
Kill people who are 94

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
There was a, you know, famous people die

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
The reason for saying famous people, they die as often

02:46.000 --> 02:52.000
If not more than the obscure

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
They die less

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
That's the point of being famous

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
They're rare

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
They die less?

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
They're rare people

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
Famous people die less than non-famous people

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
I thought it was closer to a one-to-one ratio

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
In a room full of 100 people

03:09.000 --> 03:13.000
Less of them that die will be famous

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
Well, because they're less famous people

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
Exactly, that's the point I was trying to make

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
Okay, I dig it, alright

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
There are less famous deaths than obscure deaths

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
We just know about the famous ones

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
Man, you're blowing my mind right now

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
I really did think that was an awesome mind-blowing quote

03:33.000 --> 03:37.000
I picture that as being like Yogi Berra or Mark Twain on a calendar

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
Like, there are less famous deaths than obscure ones

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
We just know about the latter

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
I can't get it back

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
I thought I did something amazing

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
I want you to smoke more strawberry coffee before every show

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
Nancy Reagan, charm, grace, and a passion for America

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
A lot of the headlines were like, this elegant suave

03:55.000 --> 03:59.000
Like, I don't know, it's a little class and like, I don't know

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
There's praising her dress

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
A lot of people say she wore a red dress

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
She wore that red dress all the time

04:07.000 --> 04:11.000
And then it's hard, it's like, well, okay, she's...

04:11.000 --> 04:15.000
There's the kind of USA Today article

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
Everybody kind of chimes in

04:17.000 --> 04:21.000
And you have people like, for instance, let's see

04:21.000 --> 04:25.000
Like Obama, he's got, of course, he's got to say something

04:25.000 --> 04:29.000
He said, our former First Lady redefined the role in her time here

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
President Obama said in the statement

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
Later, in her long goodbye with President Reagan

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
She became a voice on behalf of millions of families, blah, blah, blah

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
People are like, what did she contribute?

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
Let's eulogize her, blah, blah, blah

04:43.000 --> 04:47.000
Steve's scrolling down, Mitt Romney said...

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
Well, he kind of...

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
He said something kind of dickish too

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
That'll undercut my punchline, which is Trump

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
But it's like everybody from Republicans to Democrats

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
And everyone in between, people that lost their election

05:01.000 --> 05:05.000
Like Jimmy Carter had to say something, and he said

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
Mrs. Reagan's Just Say No program

05:07.000 --> 05:11.000
Prevented many young people from falling prey to the allure of drug use

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
Like, he's...

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
She started a phony war on drugs

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
That's put a bunch of people in prison for no goddamn reason

05:18.000 --> 05:26.000
But just confine this to the box of how to do a eulogy

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
Just for a second, and then we'll get to all that stuff

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
And that was mine

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
So it's just paragraph after paragraph after paragraph

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
It's like, Jim Henson said this, Jimmy Carter said that

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
And it's just like, oh, what's he going to say?

05:38.000 --> 05:42.000
She was like a muppet of people

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
But it says like...

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
People largely get to like, Obama had a really nice story

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
I think I read the wrong paragraph where he really kind of nailed it the most

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
Because he really did, he was like...

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
It's hard to move into the White House

05:55.000 --> 06:00.000
She gave Michelle Obama kind of like a tutorial in it

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
She was like, you know...

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
Focusing on her

06:04.000 --> 06:11.000
Donald Trump called Mrs. Reagan the wife of a truly great president

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
That's it, that's the end of my story

06:13.000 --> 06:17.000
People say he's a misogynist

06:17.000 --> 06:21.000
But listen to that, listen to how much he loves women in that quote

06:21.000 --> 06:25.000
What are you saying?

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
What a fucking cunt

06:27.000 --> 06:32.000
He can't do anything I like

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
It's kind of magical, because he's that...

06:35.000 --> 06:39.000
Every time he says something you're like, I fucking want to just hit you in the face

06:39.000 --> 06:44.000
The wife of a truly great president and an amazing, amazing woman

06:44.000 --> 06:48.000
She's really, really, really great, no it's true, it's true

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
No it's true, it's true

06:50.000 --> 06:54.000
Well, Ted Cruz said she will be remembered for her deep passion for this nation

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
And love for her husband

06:56.000 --> 07:00.000
I mean, of course, she'll be remembered for her love for her husband

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
That's because her husband will be remembered

07:02.000 --> 07:07.000
She did take care of a deeply senile, demented old dude for a long time

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
And she was really cool about that

07:08.000 --> 07:12.000
It was really weird to dance C and then I turned the TV on for a moment today

07:12.000 --> 07:17.000
And Anderson Cooper was talking to his mom, Gloria fucking Vanderbilt

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
That's fucking weird too

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
His mom's Gloria Vanderbilt, if I'm not mistaken

07:21.000 --> 07:25.000
And so they interviewed her, because she and Nancy were apparently boozing buddies

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
They were really good friends

07:27.000 --> 07:31.000
And so he's talking to Gloria Vanderbilt on the phone

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
And Anderson Cooper, news anchor

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
Okay mom, so, and he kept calling her mom

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
I was like, this is the worst news show in the world

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
Talking to your mom

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
That sounds adorable

07:45.000 --> 07:49.000
I mean, she actually eulogized Nancy quite well because they were pals

07:49.000 --> 07:53.000
But here's the thing, like so Nancy Reagan, you think, well, you guys don't think

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
Some of you think, I don't know, like Norma Taft

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
But I was a child of the 80s

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
Nancy Reagan sat on Mr. T's lap

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
Nancy Reagan was the just say no lady

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
Nancy Reagan was on, why can't I speak, because I'm high

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
Nancy Reagan was on different strokes

08:09.000 --> 08:13.000
And she had a little gimmick and she was like, she was Nancy Reagan

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
But...

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
Did she do a little dance?

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
She would, you know, she would

08:19.000 --> 08:23.000
Just like they would trot her out and she would be like, I'm here with Knight Rider

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
Knight Rider can say words that cars can't

08:26.000 --> 08:30.000
I eat all of them, but there's only one word your car needs to know

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
And that's no

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
To drugs

08:34.000 --> 08:40.000
Because my administration marks the beginning of a concept where you take, like for instance, crack cocaine

08:40.000 --> 08:45.000
And you say you get ten years in jail for the weight of crack cocaine

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
That you would get, like, a thousand years

08:48.000 --> 08:53.000
Anyways, it was, there was a lot of shit that you see people tweeting

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
And you go, like, why are you legitimizing this person?

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
I count myself among that

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
It's like, come on, Don Knotts dies

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
And you go, look, a lot of people are dying, Don Knotts died

09:03.000 --> 09:07.000
And he was in the show, goodbye Don Knotts

09:07.000 --> 09:13.000
If a president dies, then you go, like, ah, well, I remember that time in my life

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
He was president of it, okay

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
Net, net, net, net zero, like, probably

09:19.000 --> 09:23.000
Positive memories and negative, whatever, didn't know

09:23.000 --> 09:28.000
The wife of a president, I'm like, I don't know, I don't know how to deify anybody

09:28.000 --> 09:34.000
Because if you're deifying her, you're deifying her for breakfast in America or whatever that era was called

09:34.000 --> 09:38.000
It's a dawning of a new age where we're going to take all the mentally ill people and throw them in the street

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
And just call them homeless from now on

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
Like, like, like, that's not her

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
She wasn't, like, banging a gavel and saying, we should do that

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
She wasn't necessarily, like, here's the thing

09:49.000 --> 09:53.000
Big, big, big, big mistake we made during that era

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
The biggest complaint that, I mean, is the gay community

09:56.000 --> 10:03.000
Because they literally, not only were they not responsive to what they knew was an epidemic

10:03.000 --> 10:07.000
That they, actually, there's paper trails of them, like, going

10:07.000 --> 10:12.000
Let's actually, come on, we don't need that much funding for, like, like, that area and stuff

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
That's scandalous

10:13.000 --> 10:18.000
And then I said, there was a, oh, yeah, yeah, it was scandalous because it was a gay disease

10:18.000 --> 10:23.000
And then there's a story I read today and, oh, she just died

10:23.000 --> 10:27.000
So I'm, like, standing over a grave and going, now let's talk about what a shitty time that was

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
I'm not talking about her

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
You know what I mean?

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
She's probably an amazing person

10:31.000 --> 10:35.000
If I were Nancy Reagan and my legacy, we're all going to remember her for having a red dress

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
Being a first lady in that order

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
And say no to drugs

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
Just say no

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
What if she fucking just OD'd?

10:43.000 --> 10:47.000
If I were Nancy, I would just say, I'm just going to speedball it

10:47.000 --> 10:52.000
I want you to find me with Dave Navarro in a bathroom floor

10:52.000 --> 10:56.000
Or if she just sat on her deathbed, if she just said, like, listen

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
Just say yes

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
To all of it

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
Yeah

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
Yeah, there was a story I read in this

11:04.000 --> 11:09.000
Like, it brought all kinds of memories back to me

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
Because it was a story about how

11:11.000 --> 11:17.000
It's a bit, like, it's a bit, I mean, it's inflammatory

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
Like, maybe you don't even need it

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
Your hair looks amazing tonight

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
Do you blow dry it?

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
What's going on?

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
Did you shampoo?

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
What's going on?

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
Just assume you're making fun of me

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
No, I'm not

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
I'm saying, it looks really nice

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
Okay, all right

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
Having flashbacks to the school bus

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
This guy can't, cannot take a cover

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
Okay, I get it

11:37.000 --> 11:41.000
I look good, it's hilarious, goddammit

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
Just say thank you, Jeff

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
Thank you, Jeff

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
I thank you, but I don't know if it's true or not

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
Your hair looks

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
I'll have, let me look

11:55.000 --> 12:00.480
It looks I don't I don't know I well if that's not I can't see what happens on that camera

12:01.560 --> 12:03.560
I'm gonna look

12:04.080 --> 12:10.440
Give a profile and if I agree then I'll say thank you give a profile to all the cameras right now so we can see

12:17.160 --> 12:19.160
It's looking good

12:19.160 --> 12:26.960
Here wow is there a way you can see can I show you what I'm seeing from the like when you face forward with

12:26.960 --> 12:30.820
That work from your camera. Well, it'll it'll involve of some coming and going but

12:31.680 --> 12:36.440
You can't airdrop it to me, but is this oh, well, I can't I know I can't see that

12:36.440 --> 12:53.400
No, you need to take a picture of them

12:53.400 --> 12:55.400
So old

12:55.560 --> 12:57.560
Yeah, you look just like me

12:57.560 --> 12:59.560
I

13:03.080 --> 13:07.260
Really, I hope I hope I hope I hope it stays this fun until we just die like

13:09.040 --> 13:13.400
I mean, that's apparently Nancy Reagan was like yeah, I'm 94. I don't understand Donald Trump

13:15.160 --> 13:19.640
Like must be nice because a lot of people are like I'm 17. I just ate my shoe, but

13:19.640 --> 13:30.760
That's a terrible way to die. Yeah, I just now found out you can eat a shoe

13:31.400 --> 13:36.520
People when back in the old days of leather shoes when you got hungry enough you boiled your boot and you ate it

13:37.640 --> 13:39.640
Verna Herzog ate a boot he

13:39.840 --> 13:43.080
Verna Herzog did a bet with Robert Semeckis. Who was it?

13:44.040 --> 13:46.040
Errol Morris

13:46.040 --> 13:52.800
If it was Robert Semeckis and you wouldn't you wouldn't be able to trust the results like I feel like I bet I bet

13:52.800 --> 13:54.280
That's not a real boot

13:54.280 --> 13:56.280
He did a he did a bet about

13:57.160 --> 14:01.840
They had some gentlemen's bet about the documentary world. I I bet I

14:03.400 --> 14:05.400
Finishing a film on time. Okay, good. Perfect

14:07.480 --> 14:11.080
So finish a film by certain deadline and go on Herzog

14:11.080 --> 14:16.440
The bet was that he would eat a shoe and did Errol Morris shoot Herzog eating a shoe. Yeah

14:17.160 --> 14:18.880
Should look it up

14:18.880 --> 14:20.880
What's up? Oh

14:21.600 --> 14:24.480
He frightened duck fat. Oh fancy. All right

14:26.440 --> 14:28.440
Yeah, I mean if you're gonna eat a shoe

14:29.720 --> 14:32.840
What kind of shoe is it? It was like a like a Reebok or what?

14:33.440 --> 14:37.640
Headline Nancy Reagan refused to help dying Rock Hudson get age treatment

14:37.640 --> 14:45.640
Is that true? It's it's it's it's it's a story that is like I was reading it

14:45.640 --> 14:50.000
It was like bringing back all these memories because the interesting thing is it's a story about I don't know if this

14:50.040 --> 14:56.720
This should be on her hands or not, but how rock Hudson back in those days

14:57.200 --> 14:59.200
He they're in France. They had

14:59.880 --> 15:06.520
Treatments that were far more advanced than ours along the road of like acknowledging age and how to treat it rock Hudson

15:06.520 --> 15:09.360
Was like in line to get that treatment

15:09.360 --> 15:12.880
But he was blocked at an international level because this was a French hospital

15:12.880 --> 15:17.800
And there was red tape tying it up and there was a point where somebody had called the White House and said

15:17.800 --> 15:21.120
This is a friend of Nancy's from the acting day a friend of not Ronald's

15:22.200 --> 15:26.800
He if a call from the White House might be able to get him through to this French hospital and

15:27.520 --> 15:31.880
The there was a so they're you know, they're this incident is like sort of

15:31.880 --> 15:39.400
Pulled apart and you're talking to each person on the chain. They're the person that answered that call and went to Nancy

15:39.400 --> 15:47.040
Reagan and said this is the situation with rock Hudson. He acknowledges. He's he's on the side of like this is not about AIDS being a

15:48.280 --> 15:51.640
Stigmatized or anything like that that it was about objectivity

15:52.280 --> 15:54.920
Egalitarianism, oh god if we did a favor for our Hollywood friend

15:54.920 --> 16:00.380
Can you imagine lots of other people of course making the very valid observation that give me a break if Bob

16:00.380 --> 16:03.200
Hope had colon cancer if you wouldn't fucking bomb to that

16:08.200 --> 16:10.200
Just just to get your frustrations out

16:12.200 --> 16:14.200
Wasn't it wasn't it rock Hudson's

16:14.720 --> 16:20.320
Death from AIDS what softened the Reagan stance on it like it wasn't that the first time they kind of acknowledged

16:20.320 --> 16:24.400
Well, this is the thing is that that's what got me really thinking about this because part of this article is it's not

16:24.400 --> 16:27.840
It's not all just like sort of slinging and you know TM zing about like

16:27.840 --> 16:31.680
Oh, and Nancy Reagan like didn't like it goes into

16:32.400 --> 16:36.080
You know conjures these memories like you get a lot of you guys like you know

16:36.080 --> 16:40.040
it's like like I was on the playground and rock Hudson died of AIDS and

16:41.400 --> 16:47.200
Like the two things that happened were just a huge avalanche of horrible horrible jokes

16:47.440 --> 16:51.880
Just like that's how I most remember it in my brain is like the 10,000 awful

16:51.880 --> 16:57.960
Even by then standards let alone today's like horrible horrible jokes about this guy rock Hudson

16:57.960 --> 17:00.120
That none of us had ever heard of because we were kids in a playground

17:00.120 --> 17:03.920
But it's just like rock Hudson this rock Hudson that knock knock was there rock Hudson's game

17:03.920 --> 17:05.920
It's an underwear and suddenly it's just like everything

17:06.760 --> 17:11.240
Really there was just gay jokes because no one understood what AIDS was and what it meant

17:11.240 --> 17:13.480
I remember a bunch and I won't repeat them because they're terrible

17:13.480 --> 17:18.040
So it was like that that it's like it's it's it's a sad wistful kind of

17:18.040 --> 17:26.320
Story because you remember like this guy like it's it's like you kind of wish that he could have known because obviously he went out fighting and

17:27.400 --> 17:29.320
scared and

17:29.320 --> 17:35.700
Probably ashamed probably deeply ashamed and like to think you know, he's like he's sort of the Randy Quaid in the

17:36.680 --> 17:45.400
Independence Day like yeah, he's like I'm like he's he's his because everyone acknowledges historically and in fact academically that like

17:45.400 --> 17:48.840
Rock Hudson showing up on the radar at that time

17:49.280 --> 17:54.000
We managed to nudge the meteor that could have destroyed so much more

17:54.000 --> 17:59.160
Yeah, you know a little bit out of its trajectory at that people had to start talking about it

17:59.160 --> 18:06.000
There was no choice left anymore. And so all that leads to dollars and cents going and you know, whatever

18:06.600 --> 18:08.160
So it was it was a weird day

18:08.160 --> 18:12.800
I think for a lot of people because Ronald Reagan's long dead and it was like Nancy Reagan died and she was actually kind of a

18:12.800 --> 18:14.400
I mean

18:14.400 --> 18:18.320
It was a weird day for a lot of people with a lot of gay friends who died back then

18:18.960 --> 18:25.720
Because we were sort of in a in a and then and now she's dead and it's like do you spit if you're a 55 year old

18:25.960 --> 18:29.920
Gay guy. Do you go like fuck you? I hope I hope it hurt

18:31.800 --> 18:33.800
When you died

18:33.960 --> 18:35.640
Stop me if I've mentioned this before on the show

18:35.640 --> 18:40.720
But like I 20 years after I was in the king and I I went and met the leading lady

18:40.720 --> 18:46.560
Who was 20 years later, so now I'm like three feet taller and I was 11 when I last saw her now

18:46.560 --> 18:48.560
I was 31 and she was

18:48.800 --> 18:53.080
41 when I knew her and now she's 61 and we met with a great talk and at one point

18:53.080 --> 18:58.720
I said like how is so-and-so and I mentioned all the the dancers and she's like they're all gone and

18:59.200 --> 19:02.120
And I said all of them I go. What about so-and-so? What about so-and-so?

19:02.120 --> 19:05.080
They're like they're all dead Jeff they all died like a few years later

19:05.080 --> 19:11.280
And I should the only dancer in the show that wasn't dead was the only straight guy that was married to one of the women dancers

19:11.280 --> 19:15.360
She's just everybody else has gone and she goes that also that's just one show

19:15.360 --> 19:19.520
She goes all of Broadway died like and not not just our dancers, but

19:20.000 --> 19:25.360
engineers and artists and you know like doctors and like a huge generation and I

19:26.200 --> 19:28.200
I'm not the first person to say this or put this

19:28.680 --> 19:33.400
Theory out there, but I think the idiocracy that we're living in right now and that we the

19:33.400 --> 19:36.040
The the candidates that are running to rule the world right now

19:36.040 --> 19:42.360
I think a lot of it we never recovered from a giant generation of smart people dying like like at once

19:43.080 --> 19:46.720
Like in the same way the England that never quite recovered from all of its you know

19:47.120 --> 19:50.680
Intelligent men all all dying in two wars over a couple generations

19:50.680 --> 19:55.520
And you don't you don't get a Churchill anymore you get Cameron and those fucking dick wands you say

19:56.240 --> 19:58.240
Jeff saying Churchill was gay

19:58.240 --> 20:05.720
Which I think that's cool, but Churchill you're gonna get flack for that Churchill. Oh, could he suck a dick?

20:07.120 --> 20:09.680
That's why he loves cigars. He was practicing the whole time

20:10.760 --> 20:14.360
They named the Church of Cigar after him because it was the most like a dick

20:15.640 --> 20:21.760
The only thing we have to fear is fear itself and insert stereotype about curtains or prosciutto or something

20:21.760 --> 20:30.800
I bracketed it. I'm not fucking the whole the whole quote was the only thing we have to fear is fear itself and terrible

20:30.800 --> 20:32.800
Hello, dolly revivals

20:33.960 --> 20:35.960
All right, let's bring out a

20:35.960 --> 20:51.960
Rob Schrab

20:51.960 --> 21:05.360
So right before I walked out on stage

21:05.880 --> 21:10.400
Here he let me know I left a t-shirt that he gave me last week

21:10.400 --> 21:13.480
I didn't I just want to say if you don't want it

21:13.480 --> 21:17.640
I'll I'll give it to somebody who is that what you're sitting so far. Are you sitting a far away from him?

21:17.640 --> 21:19.640
I sit here every week

21:19.640 --> 21:25.960
Didn't we agree that for camera it's better that he sits closer to the didn't I agree that I want to sit over by you guys

21:26.840 --> 21:28.840
Why do we what shit my

21:29.200 --> 21:32.200
Why do we even have rehearsals Rob? Why do we come to rehearsal?

21:33.040 --> 21:36.840
All right, you guys are not this but we do tech rehearsals dress rehearsals

21:37.040 --> 21:39.880
We do a cute a cue rehearsal right before you guys get in here

21:40.440 --> 21:46.920
So are you guys ready to learn a new thing that I've learned in therapy? Yeah. Yes. Well. Oh you guys too

21:46.920 --> 21:48.920
Uh

21:49.600 --> 21:51.600
That certainty

21:51.800 --> 21:53.800
Hmm. Oh, yeah, I

21:54.760 --> 21:59.640
Have an overreactive mind and a hyper vigilant mind and an easily startled mind

22:01.120 --> 22:03.120
These are things that I've learned in therapy

22:04.240 --> 22:06.240
There are symptoms of

22:06.760 --> 22:09.680
You know like when I said you had nice hair and you freaked out

22:11.120 --> 22:13.120
Well, I

22:13.480 --> 22:15.480
Protected myself

22:15.480 --> 22:17.480
from a compliment

22:19.720 --> 22:23.720
Sorry go ahead don't overreact I'm not I'm not going to and here's why okay

22:24.800 --> 22:26.800
certainty so

22:27.680 --> 22:29.680
certainty

22:29.760 --> 22:36.680
Whenever I so my therapist told me and I've already fucked it up like three times since she prescribed this but

22:37.320 --> 22:39.320
At least I've noticed

22:39.320 --> 22:45.080
Whenever I'm certain of something I need to look at that as a warning sign

22:49.960 --> 22:52.800
Okay, what are you certain of right now?

22:53.920 --> 22:58.880
Nothing man. Well, like nothing give us of nothing. Give us a for instance. What's something? Yeah? Yeah?

22:58.880 --> 23:01.080
I don't get it. Well, I didn't make any sense

23:01.080 --> 23:06.400
Well, like if you're certain if you if so if somebody says like nice nice hair your hair looks nice

23:06.400 --> 23:12.240
And you're certain that they're making fun of you, right? Then it's like like it's before it

23:12.240 --> 23:14.720
See what what if no one says that to you ever?

23:16.120 --> 23:20.480
Well, so what it doesn't matter you could you could become certain of something like like oh

23:28.880 --> 23:32.640
Rather than this is tiered an Isaac. What is that?

23:32.640 --> 23:38.360
It's a dune tube. It blew up his tire blew up his thigh

23:39.360 --> 23:43.600
Didn't blow my dive slow-mo slow-mo atomic bomb tears. Yeah

23:45.040 --> 23:48.960
You could become certain of something sitting in your apartment alone true

23:50.760 --> 23:54.640
Probably that's actually people talking to people is the

23:55.920 --> 23:58.400
Probably the I'm I'm just thinking

23:58.400 --> 24:05.240
It it's the it's the surefire way to become uncertain and we've kind of fight that because we get rewarded for it

24:05.240 --> 24:11.800
We think or we you know, we stay safe. We go like this motherfucker trying to tell me that I want my bun toasted

24:13.520 --> 24:15.880
I've been eating this breakfast sailors for

24:16.400 --> 24:21.760
Nine on to five years. I ain't never got the bun toasted this motherfucker trying to tell me

24:22.320 --> 24:27.240
He's trying to upsell me and then you go like let me guess toast in the bun costs more

24:27.240 --> 24:33.840
And they're like no just thought you might like the bun toasted trying to make it nice for you psycho

24:33.840 --> 24:35.880
And you're like and then you look back and you go

24:35.880 --> 24:38.320
Oh, I was certain of something the

24:38.560 --> 24:43.440
If you if you if you had the same amount of information going through your head you could just as easily go oh

24:43.800 --> 24:49.240
And does it cost more to have the bun toasted? It's the information you need so up speak

24:52.560 --> 24:54.560
Look this isn't for everybody

24:54.560 --> 25:02.720
It's she specifically said like what other people need to be you can need to have more confidence in their certainty than you do

25:02.720 --> 25:09.840
She said to me like who I like anybody but me. I don't know she named names. What?

25:11.280 --> 25:15.480
Don't you guys go to the same therapist? I'll Troy and Bob and Eric

25:15.480 --> 25:19.600
Do you guys name eight billion people instead of just saying focusing on three?

25:19.600 --> 25:28.520
Dan what are you certain about right now? Rob is undermining the show. No

25:30.280 --> 25:37.880
No, I'm gonna make a conscious effort not to do that because I I listen to the show and I and I've been bad and I I

25:39.080 --> 25:42.920
Don't I don't I don't I don't want I don't want to cause pain

25:42.920 --> 25:49.000
It's especially you and I don't you know, I mean I'm just I have questions and I just

25:49.480 --> 25:53.880
Don't get answers very often and you know, all right. I'm trying to figure it out

25:53.880 --> 25:56.860
I'm just trying to figure it out like the rest of y'all man

25:57.520 --> 25:59.520
Trying to get home. I'm like

25:59.880 --> 26:01.480
you know

26:01.480 --> 26:07.680
Unlike Bill Paxson and trespass trespass man. I'm like I'm trying to I'm just trying to get a try to make it

26:07.680 --> 26:09.680
Bye like everybody else man

26:09.680 --> 26:15.360
You know I'm trying to make it by I'm trying to make it by like everybody else make it by a saying

26:16.120 --> 26:18.600
I'm trying to make it by like everybody else. I

26:19.240 --> 26:22.040
Think you're trying to convince us that trying to make it by

26:23.200 --> 26:26.760
I'm trying to make it by everyone Hitler tried to make it by

26:29.520 --> 26:31.520
It doesn't even matter if it did or not

26:32.520 --> 26:36.800
I didn't try to make it by it like everybody else. Yeah, I didn't in a very specific way

26:36.800 --> 26:39.680
That's the difference. No, but everyone tries to make it by

26:40.560 --> 26:43.360
Six million Jews are in their way. I'm just trying to make it

26:43.760 --> 26:48.240
No, he thought he thought a lot more Jews were in the way. He fell short of his mark

26:48.800 --> 26:50.800
That's that's an important thing to

26:51.640 --> 26:53.640
settle

26:53.880 --> 26:59.760
I get you when Hitler was in the bunker and he's about to blow him him and his dog and his girlfriend or newly

27:00.480 --> 27:02.480
Like what I just

27:02.480 --> 27:07.280
I'm just a dog. I just got here. What am I gotta go to?

27:07.560 --> 27:10.840
They tried the cyanide out on the dog to make sure the cyanide works

27:10.840 --> 27:16.640
They didn't want to do some bogus cyanide because he was so paranoid that he thought maybe somebody gave me some fugezi cyanide

27:16.640 --> 27:20.000
It's just gonna make you go sleepy town. I'm gonna wake up in a Russian jail

27:20.440 --> 27:24.920
And so he's like, let's make sure this is actual not kill a dog kill a Hitler cyanide

27:25.280 --> 27:29.220
And he killed his beloved dog that he had one of the only things that

27:29.220 --> 27:32.340
I'll say like that, but we know that he liked was his dog

27:32.940 --> 27:35.420
You know, he had this he was thinking

27:36.340 --> 27:42.100
Like that two birds with one thing and she's like I want to kill my keys. He killed his whole family, right?

27:42.380 --> 27:45.900
So now that was a gerbil's killed his whole family. He killed all the children and shit

27:46.380 --> 27:50.020
Hitler went in and killed Eva Braun himself and but he tried it on the dog first

27:50.020 --> 27:54.660
Oh to make sure and he really liked that dog. I think that was probably the hardest decision. He probably ever made

27:54.660 --> 27:56.660
I

28:00.820 --> 28:04.260
Know that in two minutes, I'm gonna shoot you in the head with my Luger

28:04.900 --> 28:09.980
But I don't want to make sure I want to make sure the cyanide we're taking like it's not just knock you out

28:09.980 --> 28:13.020
Eva's like you killed how many Jews give me a

28:13.660 --> 28:20.860
Brace kill the dog kill the dog. Yeah, the dog is your problem. Wrap it up. The dog. He's worried about wrap it up

28:20.860 --> 28:25.260
He's worried about wrap it up. I'm just trying to get by man

28:27.220 --> 28:31.220
Wrap it up. See he just changed. It used to be make it by now. It's trying to get by

28:31.980 --> 28:36.100
Wrap it up, man. Come on. Just wrap it up

28:36.980 --> 28:43.580
Wrap it up. You think that five vacuum this living room one more time. I'm gonna kill myself

28:45.580 --> 28:48.700
And you think they got in a big fight where she's like she's like what are you doing?

28:48.700 --> 28:52.220
He's like I'm trying to get out of the dog and she's like why and he's like cuz I don't want it

28:53.500 --> 29:00.540
Haven't turned out to hurt everybody or anyone to have to suffer and she's like oh mr. Antisuffering all of a sudden

29:00.820 --> 29:04.980
And then he's like wait, what does that mean and she's like come on

29:04.980 --> 29:11.060
What do you think it means give me the pill and he's like wait? No, I'm not killing us until you tell me what the fuck that meant

29:11.060 --> 29:21.260
Because I came home and told you I want to kill the Jews and you said that's nice sweetie. You said that's nice sweetie. Don't you fucking turn your back on me now

29:22.180 --> 29:27.980
The Russians are at the door. We are about to die. Are we on the same team or not?

29:29.540 --> 29:34.860
Just give me the just give me the pill. Just give me the pill. It's important to me

29:34.860 --> 29:41.340
Why doesn't anyone care about what's important to me Hitler?

29:42.780 --> 29:44.780
Do you know what a long day I've had

29:46.660 --> 29:49.340
No one ever asks what I want

29:58.060 --> 30:00.140
Do you think Hitler had a certainty issue too?

30:00.140 --> 30:09.500
Yeah, so you think you have that in common you said you said you're it's eight million other people don't have what you have

30:09.500 --> 30:11.500
But you think probably Hitler too, right?

30:12.740 --> 30:18.340
See right and see I just I just felt a flash of certainty that you were my enemy

30:19.340 --> 30:22.780
And then I just let it float down a river like a lotus leaf

30:22.780 --> 30:30.260
Just because someone compares you to Hitler doesn't mean they're your enemy exactly. What do I know I?

30:34.420 --> 30:36.420
Know my uncle's ghost is here

30:38.300 --> 30:41.740
But that's not certainty that's just my ghost busting equipment

30:42.460 --> 30:47.420
And so the EKG's are going up Spencer. Do you relate to that certainty sure?

30:47.420 --> 30:49.980
Do you have a whole different kind of angle now with me man?

30:49.980 --> 30:57.020
But I go what he's saying it sounds like his therapist identified a pattern of self-depeating thinking and tried to get him to

30:57.540 --> 31:03.300
You know identify it early on and intervene before it gets out of control. It seems pretty smart. Yeah

31:08.580 --> 31:11.780
How about that Ghostbusters, right I

31:13.180 --> 31:17.900
Intentionally did not watch the trailer even though everybody on Facebook and Twitter is trying to make me watch it

31:17.900 --> 31:21.380
I don't want it. I don't want to know a single thing about it when I walk in cold to that one

31:21.380 --> 31:24.880
Yeah, I'm not gonna watch it trailers are dumb man those buttons too hot

31:28.820 --> 31:32.940
I wanted to be good because who doesn't want to enjoy something

31:37.420 --> 31:39.420
Well

31:40.940 --> 31:43.900
I agree with that because of course we all want to have fun at all times

31:43.900 --> 31:49.740
What if you didn't agree with that? I didn't know that there was a Batman Superman movie coming out until my lift left

31:49.740 --> 31:54.060
Miss this young Latina lift driver. She was so you're excited about the new

31:54.820 --> 31:59.980
Superman Batman movie like I look up at a billboard like oh, I didn't know there was one and she's like I said she was

31:59.980 --> 32:01.620
Are you going to go see it? I was like

32:01.620 --> 32:06.980
You know if everybody that I like says it's awesome. I'll probably go see it if nobody says it's great

32:06.980 --> 32:11.700
I won't I will never see it and I go who's playing it. She's Ben Affleck is Batman like not seeing it

32:11.700 --> 32:14.340
That's fucking dumb

32:15.180 --> 32:16.820
Dum that does sound super dumb

32:16.820 --> 32:21.260
I just don't see how I might see it if he never is Bruce Wayne and only has the mask on the whole time

32:21.260 --> 32:23.260
So I'd never have to look at his dumb face

32:24.620 --> 32:27.020
Ben Affleck, I know you listen to Harmontown

32:28.820 --> 32:30.820
You have a dumb face I

32:31.100 --> 32:35.940
Guess I must be pickier because I was I was actually only picturing with the mask on and I was still like no

32:35.940 --> 32:42.020
He's gonna Bruce Wayne it up. He's he's I guess mostly Bruce Wayne. I think the way they've been selling it. Yeah, that's

32:43.220 --> 32:47.700
Yeah, is he gonna wait who's directing this one is it you some Jack Zack Snyder?

32:48.620 --> 32:50.620
Okay, is he Zack Snyder?

32:52.060 --> 32:54.580
Never heard of me. Is uh, do we know what the

32:56.700 --> 32:59.700
Sister is it gonna be a weird nipple nipple Batman or

32:59.700 --> 33:06.140
Uh, it looks more like old-school like Frank Miller Batman. Oh, yeah, it's closer to that

33:06.140 --> 33:09.100
Are you excited about it Rob? You care about such things. Yeah, I

33:09.780 --> 33:15.780
Still haven't seen Star Wars keychain me neither me neither. I went I went to Star Wars

33:15.780 --> 33:21.700
My I this is the story is gonna start off in a disappointing fashion. I had just done yoga and spin

33:21.700 --> 33:28.700
And then I as one does when you're on a health kick, I went straight to the drawing room to have drinks and

33:30.620 --> 33:32.180
Then my friends said hey

33:32.180 --> 33:36.420
We have an extra ticket to go see Star Wars because it was like the week after it came out

33:36.420 --> 33:42.300
You want to come like all right, so I was tired and I'm like if you do yoga and spin and you have three drinks

33:42.980 --> 33:44.780
You're sleepy

33:44.780 --> 33:50.460
So I fell asleep five minutes into that movie and they had the 3d glasses on and ever after the movie was over

33:50.460 --> 33:52.260
They had to wake me up like Jeff

33:52.260 --> 33:54.260
Jeff, I'm like, huh?

33:54.980 --> 33:58.420
Really five minutes in was asleep. It was a great nap because you got great music and

34:02.700 --> 34:05.520
And they're like, oh, we thought you were just really in the zone

34:12.100 --> 34:17.900
So then I said I gotta go see this movie. I'm gonna go see it alone. I'm gonna be rested and be sober

34:17.900 --> 34:22.660
I'm gonna watch this movie. This is Star Wars Star Wars, and I you're going back to see there was a second time

34:22.660 --> 34:27.100
No, this is I'm saying to myself the next week. I'm like, okay. I got to go back and see that I had a dream

34:27.660 --> 34:34.780
I had a dream or I went to the Vista theater in Los Feliz and saw Star Wars fell asleep in it

34:36.020 --> 34:40.780
Fell asleep in your dream fell asleep in my dream and then my dream my dream was about the dreams

34:40.780 --> 34:42.780
I had while not watching Star Wars

34:42.780 --> 34:51.300
So I'm like, this movie's got to be boring Jeff, you know, we're already impressed by you. You don't have to tell us

34:52.060 --> 34:54.700
Your dream your dreams don't have to be special

34:56.140 --> 34:58.140
Dan your certainty is really bumming me out

34:58.940 --> 35:02.700
All right. Yeah, so you're but here's why you're upset right now

35:02.700 --> 35:07.500
Here's why you had to undercut me. It's because my not seeing Star Wars story is better than you're not seeing Star Wars

35:07.500 --> 35:11.980
I'm gonna wait and saw it's coming in April

35:13.060 --> 35:14.900
That's my story

35:14.900 --> 35:17.380
You're right. What's coming in April Star Wars?

35:18.660 --> 35:24.460
To my tunes. Oh, oh, you can watch it at home. I'm just gonna watch it on iTunes like I watch everything

35:24.460 --> 35:27.660

35:28.660 --> 35:34.580
What's the last thing you watched on iTunes? I watched a I watched the Omen I

35:34.580 --> 35:38.580

35:38.580 --> 35:42.540

Anybody hear this anybody here here what I'm about to say. I

36:47.500 --> 36:51.300
Really hope you just did like a good bird call. I hear they're having like

36:52.780 --> 36:56.220
Like like six flags or theme parks are

36:56.940 --> 36:58.940
fitting people with virtual reality

36:59.500 --> 37:00.700
headsets and

37:00.700 --> 37:07.500
Stuff and then you like go on a roller coaster and but it you're on a spaceship and you're flying around and stuff

37:07.500 --> 37:11.820
I want to do that. That's kind of pretty cool. I hate roller coasters, but I think that'd be good

37:11.820 --> 37:15.940
I love roller coasters. I'll say if you call them roller coasters. It makes them way up better

37:17.420 --> 37:22.820
Either way, I don't like him, but I'd go so I do that. Have you been on exit magic mountain? No, I don't like him

37:32.820 --> 37:38.580
No, I just don't don't like you're afraid that you when you go on a ride you're gonna make chocolate poopies

37:42.180 --> 37:44.580
No, I don't I don't like roller coaster

37:44.580 --> 37:50.780
I don't I don't I don't like theme. I'll explain it to you. This is weird patronizing ticky has the last time

37:50.780 --> 37:56.740
I heard that I was in a car driving home with them on an airport and my ear hadn't popped and I was in the agonizing pain and I

37:56.740 --> 38:02.740
Got I and I said once between the baggage carousel and fucking home. I said I said goddamn

38:02.740 --> 38:06.060
I left ears to won't pop and he went you gonna make chocolate poopies

38:07.180 --> 38:09.500
Wow your relationship with

38:10.180 --> 38:14.540
Mead is so fucked up that even I can see it. That's crazy

38:15.340 --> 38:17.380
And he just did it to you right in front of me

38:19.580 --> 38:22.260
It sounds like you're both about to make chocolate poopies

38:22.260 --> 38:24.260
I

38:24.820 --> 38:30.980
Spencer you're not about to make chocolate poopies. I can tell but I'm looking at you. That's very kind of you to say I would I would agree I

38:32.260 --> 38:38.260
Just calm like I see him then Spencer and I hung out last night. Yeah, do any of those guys listen to Harmontown?

38:39.860 --> 38:42.800
What Robin invited a bunch of weird people

38:44.180 --> 38:49.060
He's like we're having some friends over and just a bunch of weird fucking people show up

38:49.060 --> 38:51.060
I

38:52.060 --> 38:54.660
Didn't say mean people. I said weird people

38:55.060 --> 38:59.060
All right. Well, it was like to do editors from Lego. Yeah

39:00.060 --> 39:04.900
Boyfriend and we just I know tell me about it. It's all all bad all bad

39:05.700 --> 39:10.900
We watch this movie. It was great. What was it called demons demons? Oh, man

39:11.620 --> 39:13.620
demons I

39:13.620 --> 39:18.460
Can't explain it because it's just a bad movie and explaining a bad movie just sounds terrible

39:18.460 --> 39:23.300
The bad is in quotes Harmon. I never saw the other omens. I don't I love the first one is great

39:23.300 --> 39:29.980
Is there more than two? Well, there's the omen with Gregory Peck and then there's the only two where I believe it's Sam

39:29.980 --> 39:35.340
Neil is Jason Bateman. Yeah, is a grown-up Damien and he's just like president and stuff

39:36.100 --> 39:40.940
He's just like we gotta kill Jesus when he gets born and everyone's like we're trying boss

39:40.940 --> 39:48.020
And it's somehow a three-act movie, but that's all that happened. I fell asleep. We just we've tried I

39:48.620 --> 39:52.780
Think I fell asleep doing it. I fell asleep. I tried watching that

39:52.780 --> 39:56.980
I think probably with you. Hey, it's uh, so I don't want to put I don't want to put this person on the spot

39:56.980 --> 39:58.980
If they're like a spot standing right here

39:59.700 --> 40:02.020
I'm gonna so I'm gonna go with your first name first

40:02.020 --> 40:07.900
I'm gonna say your first name if you think there's a reason what like like like Justin Roiland told me you're here is William here

40:08.220 --> 40:09.740
Yeah, wow

40:09.740 --> 40:14.380
All right, our hair trigger. Okay. So what are you up? Are you all he told me is that you're here?

40:14.380 --> 40:17.660
He didn't tell me whether or not you might be willing to come up. Are you willing to come up?

40:17.660 --> 40:20.020
Okay, well come up come up come up and I'll introduce you

40:28.380 --> 40:33.620
Now you're I mean I it'll be it'll be interesting if it turns out to be the case, but I guess

40:33.620 --> 40:40.900
That process didn't really filter out the possibility of you being a lying sociopath. You could just be a guy that goes

40:40.900 --> 40:45.620
Yeah, it's in his well. I am a lying sociopath, but what's your last name pew?

40:45.820 --> 40:51.000
Yes, and you are the creator of one of the most amazing video games in the world the Stanley parable the co-creator

40:56.460 --> 41:00.380
And you're you're visiting from the UK, so yes

41:00.380 --> 41:04.660
Do you so you had you've never been in front of a crowd maybe that the exhibit never their size?

41:04.660 --> 41:09.340
It's very small. Are you it's just a little island, right? Yeah, yeah, but no

41:09.340 --> 41:14.020
But you must have been it you you you it's a critically acclaimed game and it's like it's it's amazing

41:14.020 --> 41:16.520
So you've been in front of adoring people before yeah, yeah

41:20.180 --> 41:27.460
Well, so, so are you an indie so you said you co-created it who's the other person Davey reading okay a girl

41:27.460 --> 41:33.860
Uh, no, Davey. Oh, I see the Debbie. Oh, no, I wish I want this close to fucking applause

41:34.940 --> 41:36.400
close

41:36.400 --> 41:40.460
So just the two of you partners like like like what's the expertise on both sides?

41:40.580 --> 41:46.780
Yes, so Davey was the main writer and then I kind of did a lot of script editing and then I also did the

41:47.420 --> 41:50.340
Design of it. So the Stanley parable is this amazing

41:51.020 --> 41:55.700
Indie game what was it but like before I explain it to them because I don't fully understand what happened

41:55.700 --> 41:57.700
did you go to valve and

41:57.780 --> 41:59.780
No, so we

42:00.980 --> 42:06.580
We made the game and then we talked we talked to valve and they just publish it. Mm-hmm. Oh, that's the fucking amazing

42:06.580 --> 42:10.420
So is that but then they were able to weave in weave it into it's

42:11.060 --> 42:13.060
Aesthetically it kind of matches the oh, yeah

42:13.060 --> 42:18.340
Well, we were we were poor so we just stole their okay, and they just they just kind of licensed it out right and just yeah

42:18.340 --> 42:20.340
Yeah, that's awesome. Those guys are great

42:20.340 --> 42:25.220
The he made this amazing critically acclaimed video game where you

42:26.180 --> 42:28.180
look at these guys

42:28.260 --> 42:35.940
I'm explaining to you guys. I'm into it. Hello. What's your name by the way? William William. What pew pew pew?

42:52.620 --> 42:55.380
He didn't fuck it. He just put his dick in it

42:58.100 --> 43:04.480
All right, so anyways, it's an amazing video game, you know, and you never there's no there's no

43:05.740 --> 43:07.860
Somebody's given birth to a hemorrhoid am I

43:07.860 --> 43:13.620
It's it's it's it's it's like a third-person shooter go for it and then

43:15.380 --> 43:18.860
But there's no shooting and you just walk through this thing and it's based on the narration

43:18.860 --> 43:24.260
There's a vo that keeps explaining about you in the third person voiceover that stands

43:24.900 --> 43:31.060
Stanley did this and Stanley did that and there's and so you're coordinated with the voiceover up until a definitive point where there's like

43:31.060 --> 43:37.060
Oh a red door and a blue door and then it says so it's been telling you Stanley looked around the room

43:37.060 --> 43:39.940
Well, there's nothing really to do but look around the room Stanley walked down the hall

43:39.940 --> 43:44.700
Well, there's only a hall you could walk down, but there comes this definitive point early in the game where there's a red door and a blue door

43:44.700 --> 43:47.700
I'm paraphrasing. I don't know. It's literally that I can't remember

43:47.700 --> 43:52.820
But and then the voiceover says Stanley thought about it for a moment and then walked through the red door

43:52.820 --> 43:56.020
But you can do either thing and so you have to decide right in that moment

43:56.020 --> 44:02.220
Am I gonna keep doing what the voiceover says that I'm doing or am I going to definitively do the opposite? What did you do?

44:02.220 --> 44:12.260
It doesn't matter it puts you in that experience and every choice that you make has like this tree of is it a console game or an app game or

44:12.260 --> 44:18.580
It's a PC and Mac. All right. Yeah, and what is it? Wait, and there's a tree in it

44:19.780 --> 44:20.700
a

44:20.700 --> 44:22.700
Tree of logic. Yeah

44:22.700 --> 44:27.860
How old are you? You look 11 22 Jesus Christ so twice 11 so what is so so?

44:27.860 --> 44:32.620
So when that's how they say 22 in England there. I was not twice 11

44:32.940 --> 44:36.180
You were 19 when you made it. Yeah, but when do you start?

44:36.180 --> 44:42.500
So as you you must you must have been like a little lima bean when you started getting interested in computers. Yeah, I used to be a plant but now

44:43.820 --> 44:47.160
What's your earliest memory of interfacing with a computing machine?

44:47.160 --> 44:53.460
When did you germinate? I think when I was 10 like I learned flash for like animation and so like you started

44:53.460 --> 44:59.860
That's when you were coding. Yeah. Yeah, when you when he was twice five. I

45:02.140 --> 45:07.140
Like those Chelsea boots you got on there, man. Oh, thank you. Those are those are swinging. Oh, where'd you get him get a room?

45:07.820 --> 45:12.620
Leads leads leads. Oh, they got fucking good boots up. Oh, yeah

45:14.460 --> 45:18.220
Are you from Leeds? No, I'm near there, but

45:18.220 --> 45:22.980
You even where I'm from people don't know where I'm from. So why would you?

45:23.980 --> 45:28.400
This goes nowhere. This conversation goes. I'm just trying to give him a shot. What where are you from?

45:28.400 --> 45:30.900
What part of England I am from a

45:31.780 --> 45:36.580
Small village called triangle in West Yorkshire triangle. Yes. That's named after the

45:38.860 --> 45:45.060
You're from way up north pardon you from way up north then. Yes. Yes, you know it'll be more Bartat. No

45:45.060 --> 45:46.700
Yes, you do

45:46.700 --> 45:52.100
I'm my I don't know. I wasn't a song. I'm oh, I thought it was a place to Yorkshire. So, oh

45:52.980 --> 45:54.980
We please talk about video games now

45:56.660 --> 45:58.660
Carmen Sandy fucking a go

46:00.980 --> 46:02.980
Someone's making chocolate

46:05.540 --> 46:06.580
So

46:06.580 --> 46:13.900
It's a it's a relatively short period of time since the first day that you started interfacing with a machine and realizing that you could do more than

46:13.900 --> 46:18.460
Just consume what it was checking out at you and you could make it do what you wanted to around ten years old

46:19.220 --> 46:24.880
Between nine years later, you're creating a video game that if a middle-aged man

46:25.380 --> 46:29.140
Had come up with after decades and decades of interfacing with machines

46:29.180 --> 46:33.740
They would have been very very proud of not to mention a middle-aged woman. Don't fucking write letters

46:36.140 --> 46:39.140
The the but but like so what's what's

46:39.140 --> 46:44.940
So I'm gonna I want to ask you a couple things first. There's a tree of things that I could ask you as a

46:45.420 --> 46:47.420
kind of parable

46:48.300 --> 46:51.580
But like I so what what it when you like

46:52.300 --> 46:56.980
I think the thing that makes it critically acclaimed is that it has it has a distinct style distinct

46:57.780 --> 47:04.820
Voice it's like it's it's a it's a video game that has it's it's it's it's it's like a film that's directed and yet you're interacting with it

47:04.820 --> 47:06.820
So which of you and your partner are?

47:06.820 --> 47:15.700
Who's got this like weird passion for subverting the entire like that was both of us? I suppose like um

47:16.540 --> 47:18.540
Yeah, you don't want to throw him under the bus

47:18.980 --> 47:23.700
No, you did a lot of very important work, but it was all me, you know, that's the important

47:24.580 --> 47:26.340
Yeah, hi me

47:26.340 --> 47:32.140
Pardon what I mean does this represent are we getting a glimpse since you are so young are we getting a glimpse?

47:32.140 --> 47:38.660
It's something that you wish had you the resources like what can you like do you is this what you want to keep doing?

47:38.660 --> 47:42.300
Is this just yeah, I've my employed people now to do for me

47:42.300 --> 47:47.580
So and so and so what's what's your what's your vision of like the ultimate video game? Are you excited about VR?

47:48.020 --> 47:52.020
Yeah, yeah, I'm here to work on a VR thing with Justin actually. All right. I

47:53.300 --> 47:55.740
Wish you would have told me about that but voice rover

47:55.740 --> 48:05.940
It was good, but don't go back and look at it

48:11.340 --> 48:14.300
Are you gonna move the stage nah, nah

48:15.700 --> 48:22.340
Thank you. It's too dry. It's too dry here. Well, it's a desert. There's a whole states. Yeah, you could you could move to Portland

48:22.340 --> 48:30.140
You'd be like working slickers. I don't know anything about Portland. It's it's like England, but it's connected to a giant America

48:31.220 --> 48:34.380
So you can like you're it's like there's a land bridge to the rest of

48:36.940 --> 48:38.940
I know some people find it convenient I

48:40.860 --> 48:43.340
England seems to see it looks like I get claustrophobic

48:44.020 --> 48:47.820
Seems very small. How did it how did it start you like what was the beginning of that?

48:47.820 --> 48:52.420
Had you already worked on games before? Yeah, I've done stuff called mods. So like you um

48:53.060 --> 48:58.380
You take a game that already exists exists like Half-Life or whatever and then you just change things

48:58.380 --> 49:04.340
You make things out of the already existing parts and you move it about and that's that's why I did for what kind of mods

49:04.340 --> 49:07.740
Did you make are they just unofficial just for your own things?

49:07.740 --> 49:11.260
Oh, yeah, I mostly made maps for Team Fortress 2. I also left it dead

49:11.260 --> 49:17.580
Okay, cool. Oh, so you weren't you weren't an employee of the game manufacturer. Oh, no, no, just doing it on your own now

49:17.580 --> 49:23.060
I don't think it was legal for them to employ someone that young. Oh, really? Oh, no. No, it was yeah

49:23.060 --> 49:26.060
It was my first job. Oh, so you were what under 18 men or yeah

49:26.060 --> 49:31.180
I I started working on it when I was 17 and then I've got released when I was 19

49:31.180 --> 49:34.460
So then you then you had you you learned the skills that you needed to make your own game

49:34.860 --> 49:38.660
Mate, are you coding the whole thing? You're doing it all yourself. There's not that much coding

49:38.660 --> 49:42.460
I don't know how to code. All right. Yeah, so you just come up with the concept of a game

49:42.460 --> 49:45.020
then yes, yes, and and then

49:45.580 --> 49:50.420
Using the tools that you get to put that and you go in like it like you're pitching a TV show you pitch

49:50.420 --> 49:51.340
So here's a game idea

49:51.340 --> 49:56.260
I have and you pitch it to this larger company like usually how it works is a rev share and you get the people on the team that you

49:56.260 --> 50:01.940
Need to like make it and then you just split the revenue. Wow. Yeah, great. You do you have another game in the works?

50:01.940 --> 50:05.380
Oh, yeah, I a couple cool. That's great. Is it all?

50:05.380 --> 50:10.300
And obviously you're gonna tell me if there's something you don't want to say out loud

50:10.300 --> 50:14.100
But is it all 2d or all VR that your next project?

50:15.580 --> 50:19.260
We've got two one is 2d and one is fear

50:22.220 --> 50:24.420
And pretty funny every

50:24.420 --> 50:28.420
I

50:31.820 --> 50:34.980
Got two of them to the I see how that's hilarious. I

50:35.860 --> 50:37.860
Do want to know what that guy was laughing at?

50:40.700 --> 50:47.220
Well, let's not let's not cross the line into full shaming him about it. No, no, no, no, but I don't know

50:47.900 --> 50:51.300
Sir sir, I'm gonna look I'm gonna look down and close my eyes

50:51.300 --> 50:54.420
You know just call out maybe what what it was that was amusing you

50:55.620 --> 51:00.220
His the the Williams reaction like how did I react? Oh

51:02.260 --> 51:04.260
Good

51:04.380 --> 51:09.480
Several layers. No, it's okay. We don't know bro. It's just having a great time at your show

51:12.540 --> 51:14.540
Hey guys guys, what is wrong?

51:14.540 --> 51:21.700
It's a jacket make sure you guys are laughing for the right reason. Yeah, no fucking long laughing

51:22.300 --> 51:24.300
Wrong laffer. You're wrong laffer

51:25.820 --> 51:27.820
Unreal

51:27.820 --> 51:34.180
Guys just want to have has a good time. You're just trying to make it bar. It's just trying to make it by

51:35.580 --> 51:37.580
Trying to make it by

51:37.580 --> 51:44.740
This is the only happiness in his life that you make fun of shame. It's terrible. Yeah

51:45.500 --> 51:47.500
That'll save everything keep it going

51:50.500 --> 51:52.500
Did you just vodka shame Dan or

51:54.980 --> 52:02.020
Our show runs on vodka that's that's the gasoline William. Do you think that mankind needs to be governed?

52:02.020 --> 52:06.180
Here we go

52:08.020 --> 52:11.340
Depends what you mean governed. How do you mean governor not in a hot way?

52:12.500 --> 52:14.500
Not like a harness. I

52:15.500 --> 52:23.420
Mean just like like told told what to do. Yeah, I mean, yes, how do you people keep calling each other governor?

52:23.420 --> 52:25.420
All right, all right, okay

52:30.660 --> 52:34.860
Y'all can't be governor all right ding ding we were all thinking it

52:36.060 --> 52:42.100
Why do you people are going to good morning governor? Good morning governor. You can't all it's a term of respect

52:42.100 --> 52:50.740
Okay, all right shut you down right back. Yeah, it's called respect right

52:53.500 --> 52:58.780
But get you also say it like you can use it ironically call somebody gov when you're like you're making like you're not respectable

52:58.780 --> 53:00.780
No, no one actually says it. No, no

53:01.580 --> 53:07.340
But you knew what I was talking about. It's a stereotype like how we say all Americans are idiots, you know, it's not now

53:07.340 --> 53:10.420
But you know, you know, that's actually not a stereotype. That's true

53:10.420 --> 53:17.260
That's that's it's it's not an absolute truth, but it's it's it's heavily backed by like, yeah

53:18.300 --> 53:22.060
100 years, it's it's an it's an allowable statement

53:23.740 --> 53:30.600
I do love I mean, I do you live in London, William? Nope. No, middle of Noah middle of Noah. All right. I'm trying

53:31.980 --> 53:33.980
Triangle

53:34.180 --> 53:36.020
Yeah

53:36.020 --> 53:41.740
He said triangle. Why is it called triangle? Cuz that's what they called it

53:42.620 --> 53:44.620
Why did they call it Los Angeles?

53:44.860 --> 53:51.400
It's in the shape of a triangle. It's because he's actually come on. It's a village. Yeah, it's because they crush all the pus

53:51.400 --> 54:03.240
Oh, they don't call it in a ball. It's just a plant. They just call it crush and pus in England then. No, I'm saying I'm translating it to you guys.

54:03.240 --> 54:05.240
We crush all the pus, governor.

54:05.880 --> 54:10.000
We we govern all the pus. We govern all the pus, governor.

54:13.920 --> 54:17.200
Welcome to the pink triangle, where we govern all the bulls.

54:17.200 --> 54:20.400
Oh, so have you achieved

54:22.160 --> 54:29.340
Were you born were you low born high born mid-born? I was low mid-born low mid-born. Yeah

54:32.040 --> 54:35.100
Yes, my low mid-born friend

54:36.680 --> 54:38.680
I'm representing you

54:39.520 --> 54:43.460
Have you have you have you have you changed much on that scales?

54:43.460 --> 54:46.780
It's like so how does that money come in? It's like so valve

54:47.500 --> 54:52.380
So they take a cup then we split it down depending on they just treated it like a publishing house

54:52.380 --> 54:56.140
Like and it was your book and they yeah, like they don't even like do any services like that

54:56.140 --> 55:00.540
They just put it on this site. Was it strictly 100% on steam?

55:01.540 --> 55:08.820
Yeah, yeah, and then and so and just like like you're rich rich. Yeah, I'm so rich. Yeah, what do you drive?

55:08.820 --> 55:18.900
I mean either but I'm not rich. I have people. Yeah, I was just when I just wanted to hear like an Aston Martin or something

55:18.900 --> 55:23.220
I don't know what I was looking for. It's so tiny there. You could walk. You can walk. Yeah, you just

55:23.220 --> 55:28.700
Walk to all four points. I'm in all four points

55:30.540 --> 55:32.540
Okay, yeah, yeah, okay

55:34.020 --> 55:36.020
He doesn't live in square. Oh

55:37.860 --> 55:41.140
That's what I got. I screwed up. I screwed up

55:45.700 --> 55:51.340
I didn't even realize I thought everyone was laughing at like a boat a United Kingdom joke that

55:51.340 --> 55:53.340
I was like fuck

55:54.820 --> 55:56.820
I'm like dumber than I thought

55:57.820 --> 56:00.780
I guess I guess England's famous for its seven points

56:05.980 --> 56:07.980
I got a little stone before the show

56:09.500 --> 56:11.020
Yeah

56:11.020 --> 56:21.500
Why are you stoned? I'm not stoned. Hey, you guys. Why? Hey, what? I'm talking to my I'm talking to mine

56:21.500 --> 56:26.780
All right, fine. Do you okay? Fine. Fine. We'll both podcast at the same time. Yes, William

56:26.780 --> 56:33.980
Do you have to be a US citizen? Well, what is your secret for your amazing buttermilk biscuits, California residents?

56:33.980 --> 56:41.660
You make a buttermilk biscuit. That's so savory. So do people tell you young Tim Burton a lot? Yeah, delicious

56:41.660 --> 56:47.660
Do you use actual buttermilk? I try not to use milk, but I can't compare. No, you can do it.

56:47.660 --> 56:49.660
Have you ever met Richard Branson?

56:49.660 --> 56:51.660
Put your hand on me. Oh, I'm not.

56:53.660 --> 56:57.660
I don't even think you're good. But I demand it to be toasted. It's not good.

56:57.660 --> 57:01.660
What has happened with Argentina? It's always a thing on Pink Floyd albums, but I never heard.

57:01.660 --> 57:07.660
I can't hear my podcast.

57:17.660 --> 57:25.660
I feel like we should be charging people double for this show. It's twice the podcast.

57:25.660 --> 57:35.660
It's twice podcast.

57:35.660 --> 57:39.660
Spencer, do you have any questions about?

57:39.660 --> 57:43.660
Spencer, do you have any table magic tonight?

57:43.660 --> 57:47.660
Oh, yeah. Does anybody have it?

57:47.660 --> 57:51.660
Why do you have a table? Why do you have a table?

57:51.660 --> 57:55.660
Because the other table is in the shop.

57:55.660 --> 57:59.660
Is it just for your water bottle? Yeah.

57:59.660 --> 58:03.660
Why does he have a table? Well, I don't request a table.

58:03.660 --> 58:07.660
Because he used to roll dice on it and then stopped three years ago.

58:07.660 --> 58:13.660
And he said, I know one thing. Let's keep the table.

58:13.660 --> 58:15.660
Because we're too lazy to change our writer.

58:15.660 --> 58:23.660
We have the same watch. We have the same watch.

58:23.660 --> 58:27.660
Oh, the Milanese bloop.

58:27.660 --> 58:31.660
What do you think of the Apple Watch?

58:31.660 --> 58:35.660
Well, this isn't on merely a fashion statement.

58:35.660 --> 58:37.660
Just to have one in your pocket?

58:37.660 --> 58:39.660
Well, I was wearing it, but it annoys me.

58:39.660 --> 58:43.660
It catches in your arm.

58:43.660 --> 58:45.660
It's fucking awful.

58:45.660 --> 58:47.660
It's like, oh, you put an iPhone on my wrist.

58:47.660 --> 58:51.660
It reminded me that I was so happy that watches didn't have to be a thing anymore.

58:51.660 --> 58:53.660
I don't know. I keep giving it a shot, though.

58:53.660 --> 58:55.660
I keep feeling like, oh, see, there's a text.

58:55.660 --> 59:01.660
Do you do the stand-up every fucking 10 times a day thing on it?

59:01.660 --> 59:05.660
I want to turn that back on. I turned it off.

59:05.660 --> 59:07.660
But I'll find myself going like this a lot.

59:07.660 --> 59:09.660
Oh, yes!

59:09.660 --> 59:11.660
Because there's a text on it that I'm holding.

59:11.660 --> 59:13.660
Yeah, that's it.

59:13.660 --> 59:15.660
Okay.

59:15.660 --> 59:19.660
Because you're usually holding a drink in your other hand.

59:19.660 --> 59:21.660
Yes.

59:27.660 --> 59:31.660
Your nose works like a finger. I love that.

59:31.660 --> 59:33.660
It's dumb, though. You know what?

59:33.660 --> 59:35.660
Yeah, take it off.

59:35.660 --> 59:37.660
This goes right here.

59:37.660 --> 59:39.660
Fuck it.

59:39.660 --> 59:43.660
In case I meet someone else that has an Apple Watch,

59:43.660 --> 59:47.660
and then I'll pull it out of my pocket.

59:47.660 --> 59:49.660
All right.

59:49.660 --> 59:53.660
So you got rich. You're really young.

59:53.660 --> 59:55.660
Are you afraid of the burnout?

59:55.660 --> 59:59.660
Nah, now you just get other people to burn out for you.

59:59.660 --> 01:00:01.660
Yeah.

01:00:01.660 --> 01:00:03.660
What are you talking about?

01:00:03.660 --> 01:00:05.660
What's the burnout?

01:00:05.660 --> 01:00:07.660
You've not heard of the burnout?

01:00:07.660 --> 01:00:11.660
Well, burnout is a game for the PS2 called Burnout.

01:00:11.660 --> 01:00:13.660
Right.

01:00:13.660 --> 01:00:15.660
And it's about cars.

01:00:15.660 --> 01:00:17.660
And it's famous because all of the development team died.

01:00:17.660 --> 01:00:19.660
Oh!

01:00:19.660 --> 01:00:21.660
Like at once in a plane crash or what?

01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:23.660
No, no, no.

01:00:23.660 --> 01:00:27.660
They had to launch it in a really short amount of time

01:00:27.660 --> 01:00:29.660
because of publishers and stuff.

01:00:29.660 --> 01:00:33.660
And so what happened was they had to do Crunch,

01:00:33.660 --> 01:00:37.660
which is like you work like 16 to 20 hours a day.

01:00:37.660 --> 01:00:41.660
And what happens is they did that for like six months.

01:00:41.660 --> 01:00:43.660
And then at the end, like within like a year,

01:00:43.660 --> 01:00:45.660
all of them had died.

01:00:45.660 --> 01:00:47.660
They called it the burnout.

01:00:47.660 --> 01:00:49.660
Is that real?

01:00:49.660 --> 01:00:51.660
No.

01:00:51.660 --> 01:00:57.660
I felt like you were hoping there were more video game industry people

01:00:57.660 --> 01:00:59.660
in the audience at the point where you said

01:00:59.660 --> 01:01:01.660
they had to do Crunch and you're like,

01:01:01.660 --> 01:01:03.660
okay, fuck, all right.

01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:05.660
What is the burnout?

01:01:05.660 --> 01:01:07.660
Why would you be afraid of the burnout?

01:01:07.660 --> 01:01:15.660
It's like they say prostitutes have like five good years.

01:01:15.660 --> 01:01:19.660
And it's like that with coders because you just work.

01:01:19.660 --> 01:01:21.660
So you work crazy hours all the time.

01:01:21.660 --> 01:01:25.660
Oh, you're mentally burnout.

01:01:25.660 --> 01:01:27.660
I got you.

01:01:27.660 --> 01:01:33.660
The prostitutes I know have been in the business for decades.

01:01:33.660 --> 01:01:39.660
Perhaps you should start seeing other prostitutes.

01:01:39.660 --> 01:01:43.660
Oh, snap!

01:01:43.660 --> 01:01:47.660
Do not tell me how to have a good time, William.

01:01:47.660 --> 01:01:49.660
I'm sorry that was...

01:01:49.660 --> 01:01:57.660
Are there any... Do you ever do role-playing?

01:01:57.660 --> 01:02:01.660
Yes, let's go to that right now.

01:02:01.660 --> 01:02:03.660
Sometimes, I guess.

01:02:03.660 --> 01:02:05.660
Do you do that voice when you...

01:02:05.660 --> 01:02:07.660
Yeah, what? What, going up?

01:02:07.660 --> 01:02:09.660
Yeah.

01:02:09.660 --> 01:02:11.660
Yeah, if the situation calls for you to say...

01:02:11.660 --> 01:02:13.660
Are you in a monogamous relationship or are you a single woman?

01:02:13.660 --> 01:02:19.660
No, I'm just all about fucking...

01:02:19.660 --> 01:02:23.660
Again, it's one of these moments where people listen to the podcast for free.

01:02:23.660 --> 01:02:25.660
For $5, you can watch this podcast.

01:02:25.660 --> 01:02:31.660
I feel like people need to know that we have a sexy 22-year-old Russell Brand game nerd.

01:02:31.660 --> 01:02:35.660
And you're really robbing us off right now because...

01:02:35.660 --> 01:02:37.660
Pay them money.

01:02:37.660 --> 01:02:39.660
You can hear ovaries rattling in here right now.

01:02:39.660 --> 01:02:45.660
Ovaries aren't supposed to rattle.

01:02:45.660 --> 01:02:47.660
They're not supposed to.

01:02:47.660 --> 01:02:51.660
It's when they get able to rattle that they get the most...

01:02:51.660 --> 01:02:57.660
It's like a rattle snake.

01:02:57.660 --> 01:02:59.660
It's a warning.

01:02:59.660 --> 01:03:01.660
Well, it's a warning or an invitation, depending on...

01:03:01.660 --> 01:03:07.660
All right, so...

01:03:07.660 --> 01:03:09.660
You're all about fucking...

01:03:09.660 --> 01:03:11.660
Hold on.

01:03:11.660 --> 01:03:17.660
I was going to talk about D&D, but he said sexual role-playing, which I want to talk about.

01:03:17.660 --> 01:03:19.660
Can we lower the lights a little bit?

01:03:19.660 --> 01:03:21.660
You're not in a monogamous relationship right now.

01:03:21.660 --> 01:03:23.660
You're Roman and Bonin.

01:03:23.660 --> 01:03:25.660
You coined it?

01:03:25.660 --> 01:03:29.660
Hashtag Roman and Bonin.

01:03:29.660 --> 01:03:31.660
Probably won't catch on.

01:03:31.660 --> 01:03:33.660
It's not that good.

01:03:33.660 --> 01:03:35.660
I love Ronin and Bonin's laughing. Did you ever see...

01:03:35.660 --> 01:03:37.660
I like when...

01:03:37.660 --> 01:03:39.660
The guy that will pop out and go,

01:03:39.660 --> 01:03:41.660
Very interesting.

01:03:41.660 --> 01:03:43.660
Stop, just give me a second.

01:03:43.660 --> 01:03:45.660
I just want to make a good show.

01:03:45.660 --> 01:03:47.660
Ronin and Bonin's laughing.

01:03:47.660 --> 01:03:49.660
All right, we'll just...

01:03:49.660 --> 01:03:51.660
Suck it.

01:03:51.660 --> 01:03:53.660
Have you ever...

01:03:53.660 --> 01:03:55.660
During a heated...

01:03:55.660 --> 01:03:57.660
It doesn't matter if it's a one-night stand, because who cares what happens after.

01:03:57.660 --> 01:03:59.660
But the first night,

01:03:59.660 --> 01:04:01.660
you're with a person and then you're like,

01:04:01.660 --> 01:04:03.660
in the heat of the moment,

01:04:03.660 --> 01:04:05.660
we're going to do it.

01:04:05.660 --> 01:04:07.660
Have you ever done role-playing in that?

01:04:07.660 --> 01:04:09.660
I know you've never said we're going to do it.

01:04:09.660 --> 01:04:11.660
But have you ever said,

01:04:11.660 --> 01:04:13.660
I'm going to be a tennis instructor?

01:04:13.660 --> 01:04:15.660
Have you ever snapped into role-playing

01:04:15.660 --> 01:04:17.660
in that moment, the first night?

01:04:17.660 --> 01:04:19.660
First day, yeah.

01:04:19.660 --> 01:04:21.660
This is a question I didn't ask anybody.

01:04:21.660 --> 01:04:23.660
Not because you're a game designer.

01:04:23.660 --> 01:04:25.660
Yeah, so a lot of the time,

01:04:25.660 --> 01:04:27.660
people are bored by the answer of the question.

01:04:27.660 --> 01:04:29.660
What do you do as a job?

01:04:29.660 --> 01:04:31.660
I'm a game designer and people aren't interested in that.

01:04:31.660 --> 01:04:33.660
Sometimes I just lie and say,

01:04:33.660 --> 01:04:35.660
oh, I'm an actor.

01:04:35.660 --> 01:04:37.660
I'm...

01:04:37.660 --> 01:04:39.660
I'm a construction worker.

01:04:39.660 --> 01:04:41.660
And then you have sex with those people

01:04:41.660 --> 01:04:43.660
and don't leave character as a construction worker.

01:04:43.660 --> 01:04:45.660
So that's role-playing.

01:04:45.660 --> 01:04:47.660
Well, that's catcher in the rye role-playing.

01:04:47.660 --> 01:04:49.660
That's heavy duty shit.

01:04:49.660 --> 01:04:51.660
You know it's a good one I've used before,

01:04:51.660 --> 01:04:53.660
because people don't believe you're a construction worker.

01:04:57.660 --> 01:04:59.660
My father owns the company

01:04:59.660 --> 01:05:01.660
and I managed them.

01:05:01.660 --> 01:05:03.660
Ah, nice.

01:05:03.660 --> 01:05:05.660
I don't care anymore,

01:05:05.660 --> 01:05:07.660
but when I was like...

01:05:07.660 --> 01:05:09.660
It's 9-11.

01:05:09.660 --> 01:05:11.660
Or as we call it...

01:05:11.660 --> 01:05:13.660
It's 9-11.

01:05:13.660 --> 01:05:15.660
What?

01:05:15.660 --> 01:05:17.660
I get bored of...

01:05:17.660 --> 01:05:19.660
People say, oh, so what do you do?

01:05:19.660 --> 01:05:21.660
You don't want to say you're an actor

01:05:21.660 --> 01:05:23.660
because you need to go, oh, what have you been in?

01:05:23.660 --> 01:05:25.660
I don't want to have that conversation.

01:05:25.660 --> 01:05:27.660
So I did think...

01:05:27.660 --> 01:05:29.660
A couple times...

01:05:29.660 --> 01:05:31.660
This is a good one for guys that are just

01:05:31.660 --> 01:05:33.660
terrible people.

01:05:33.660 --> 01:05:35.660
If you wanted to be a liar,

01:05:35.660 --> 01:05:37.660
say you're a high school principal

01:05:37.660 --> 01:05:39.660
and fucking adhere to it.

01:05:39.660 --> 01:05:41.660
Say what school just you worked for

01:05:41.660 --> 01:05:43.660
and people are like, why are you at a bar?

01:05:43.660 --> 01:05:45.660
I'm like, because I'm the principal, baby.

01:05:45.660 --> 01:05:47.660
I'm fucking...

01:05:47.660 --> 01:05:49.660
Gotta blow off steam.

01:05:49.660 --> 01:05:51.660
My high school principal

01:05:51.660 --> 01:05:53.660
wasn't tall and like hanging out at bars.

01:05:53.660 --> 01:05:55.660
So I...

01:05:55.660 --> 01:05:57.660
I really want to do it.

01:05:57.660 --> 01:05:59.660
High school principal is sexy.

01:05:59.660 --> 01:06:01.660
But you have to be...

01:06:01.660 --> 01:06:03.660
The reward is you're either lying to a stranger

01:06:03.660 --> 01:06:05.660
the entire time and then they never know.

01:06:05.660 --> 01:06:07.660
Or at some point they go like,

01:06:07.660 --> 01:06:09.660
come on, you're not...

01:06:09.660 --> 01:06:11.660
You've been lying to me

01:06:11.660 --> 01:06:13.660
and I should not trust people

01:06:13.660 --> 01:06:15.660
in the future and you're like...

01:06:17.660 --> 01:06:19.660
I'm just doing my part

01:06:19.660 --> 01:06:21.660
to toxify humanity.

01:06:21.660 --> 01:06:23.660
Like, I just don't...

01:06:23.660 --> 01:06:25.660
I can't picture...

01:06:25.660 --> 01:06:27.660
Ever doing that.

01:06:27.660 --> 01:06:29.660
The first time I came to LA for Milwaukee

01:06:29.660 --> 01:06:31.660
one of the first conversations I had at a bar

01:06:31.660 --> 01:06:33.660
because I was like, in a bar,

01:06:33.660 --> 01:06:35.660
I don't know anybody in Milwaukee

01:06:35.660 --> 01:06:37.660
you might just turn to the person next to you

01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:39.660
and go like, hey, how's it going?

01:06:39.660 --> 01:06:41.660
And they did it in LA.

01:06:41.660 --> 01:06:43.660
I never made this mistake again.

01:06:43.660 --> 01:06:45.660
I was like, hey, how's it going?

01:06:45.660 --> 01:06:47.660
And the guy's like, fine, fine.

01:06:47.660 --> 01:06:49.660
And I'm like...

01:06:49.660 --> 01:06:51.660
So you're here to see the band?

01:06:51.660 --> 01:06:53.660
And I had no idea I was committing

01:06:53.660 --> 01:06:55.660
the fucking devil's sin

01:06:55.660 --> 01:06:57.660
if that's a new... coined it?

01:06:57.660 --> 01:06:59.660
And he said,

01:06:59.660 --> 01:07:01.660
I silk screened t-shirts.

01:07:01.660 --> 01:07:03.660
And I said, oh, that's interesting.

01:07:03.660 --> 01:07:05.660
So where's the silk of the screen and the thing?

01:07:05.660 --> 01:07:07.660
And I'm like, I got a million questions

01:07:07.660 --> 01:07:09.660
about silk screening t-shirts.

01:07:09.660 --> 01:07:11.660
10 minutes goes by and then he goes,

01:07:11.660 --> 01:07:13.660
I'm just fucking with you, dude.

01:07:13.660 --> 01:07:15.660
And I went back to my house

01:07:15.660 --> 01:07:17.660
and I wrote movies.

01:07:17.660 --> 01:07:19.660
And I never went out again.

01:07:19.660 --> 01:07:21.660
I was at a bar that was nobody

01:07:21.660 --> 01:07:23.660
with my ex roommate from years ago

01:07:23.660 --> 01:07:25.660
at the place that you live in, Ron.

01:07:25.660 --> 01:07:27.660
My ex angry Irish roommate, Paul.

01:07:27.660 --> 01:07:29.660
And he was angry.

01:07:29.660 --> 01:07:31.660
He was Irish and angry.

01:07:31.660 --> 01:07:33.660
But a great animator.

01:07:33.660 --> 01:07:35.660
And we were out at a bar that was at three clubs.

01:07:35.660 --> 01:07:37.660
Nobody's in there.

01:07:37.660 --> 01:07:39.660
And I was like, can you do all...

01:07:39.660 --> 01:07:41.660
Because he was Irish.

01:07:41.660 --> 01:07:43.660
And I was like, can you do all UK and Irish?

01:07:43.660 --> 01:07:45.660
Can you do regional dialects?

01:07:45.660 --> 01:07:47.660
He was like, I'm pretty good at it.

01:07:47.660 --> 01:07:49.660
And so he's doing a Scottish accent.

01:07:49.660 --> 01:07:51.660
So I was trying to mimic him and do it.

01:07:51.660 --> 01:07:53.660
So we're just hanging out at the bar, not for anybody else.

01:07:53.660 --> 01:07:55.660
There was nobody in there.

01:07:55.660 --> 01:07:57.660
And so we're just talking in Scottish.

01:07:57.660 --> 01:07:59.660
He's doing a perfect Scottish accent.

01:07:59.660 --> 01:08:01.660
I'm trying to do it, too.

01:08:01.660 --> 01:08:03.660
And the bartender's there.

01:08:03.660 --> 01:08:05.660
He's heard me already speak in American English.

01:08:05.660 --> 01:08:07.660
And he's heard this guy be Irish from Dublin.

01:08:07.660 --> 01:08:09.660
And now we're doing Scottish.

01:08:09.660 --> 01:08:11.660
Then the bar starts to fill up.

01:08:11.660 --> 01:08:13.660
And all of a sudden girls just start gravitating toward this name.

01:08:13.660 --> 01:08:15.660
They're like, oh, your accents are so cute.

01:08:15.660 --> 01:08:17.660
And we're just doing it like as a joke.

01:08:17.660 --> 01:08:19.660
We think they're going to get their drink and fuck off.

01:08:19.660 --> 01:08:21.660
Like go back to their seat or whatever.

01:08:21.660 --> 01:08:23.660
So now there's this girl.

01:08:23.660 --> 01:08:25.660
And she's hanging out.

01:08:25.660 --> 01:08:27.660
And so we're doing...

01:08:27.660 --> 01:08:29.660
Oh, how far is that from Edinburgh?

01:08:29.660 --> 01:08:31.660
I'm making it up.

01:08:31.660 --> 01:08:33.660
It's about 50 kilometres.

01:08:33.660 --> 01:08:35.660
I have no idea.

01:08:35.660 --> 01:08:37.660
And she's like, oh, it's so cute.

01:08:37.660 --> 01:08:39.660
And then she invites...

01:08:39.660 --> 01:08:41.660
Now her posse shows up.

01:08:41.660 --> 01:08:43.660
She invites all the other girls over.

01:08:43.660 --> 01:08:45.660
I was thinking she was going to leave for five minutes.

01:08:45.660 --> 01:08:47.660
And then there's this really hot girl.

01:08:47.660 --> 01:08:49.660
And she goes like, would you...

01:08:49.660 --> 01:08:51.660
I really want to go home with you.

01:08:51.660 --> 01:08:53.660
But I just have to talk to my dad first.

01:08:53.660 --> 01:08:57.660
He's the minister of accent inspection.

01:08:57.660 --> 01:08:59.660
And it's William Atherton

01:08:59.660 --> 01:09:01.660
in two wigs and eight glasses.

01:09:01.660 --> 01:09:03.660
So now we feel bad.

01:09:03.660 --> 01:09:05.660
We don't want to tell this girl, oh, we were just fucking with you

01:09:05.660 --> 01:09:07.660
thinking this was a temporary bit

01:09:07.660 --> 01:09:10.660
that you were going to go away and not hang out with two dorks

01:09:10.660 --> 01:09:12.660
pretending to be Scottish at the bar.

01:09:12.660 --> 01:09:14.660
And so now there's five chicks hanging out

01:09:14.660 --> 01:09:17.660
and the bartender is looking at us like, you fucking turds.

01:09:17.660 --> 01:09:19.660
He's just like, oh, boy.

01:09:19.660 --> 01:09:21.660
And so now we were embarrassed.

01:09:21.660 --> 01:09:23.660
So now we're committing to it.

01:09:23.660 --> 01:09:25.660
But now because I'm doing it and I'm getting better at it.

01:09:25.660 --> 01:09:28.660
And so we all leave.

01:09:28.660 --> 01:09:30.660
Finally they go away.

01:09:30.660 --> 01:09:33.660
And I thought, okay, boy, that took a lot more effort.

01:09:33.660 --> 01:09:36.660
Shoot, we almost fucked those girls.

01:09:36.660 --> 01:09:38.660
Whoo!

01:09:38.660 --> 01:09:40.660
I dodged the bomb there.

01:09:40.660 --> 01:09:42.660
Oh, my God.

01:09:42.660 --> 01:09:44.660
They thought we were cute.

01:09:44.660 --> 01:09:46.660
I heard the ovaries rattling.

01:09:46.660 --> 01:09:48.660
I knew it was a warning.

01:09:48.660 --> 01:09:50.660
Let's say you're Scottish accent.

01:09:50.660 --> 01:09:52.660
How do you do it?

01:09:52.660 --> 01:09:54.660
Do you Scottish accent?

01:09:54.660 --> 01:09:56.660
Well, also I just got a girlfriend later on,

01:09:56.660 --> 01:09:58.660
so I'm a bit better at it.

01:09:58.660 --> 01:10:00.660
At the time, not that good.

01:10:00.660 --> 01:10:02.660
I wouldn't say I'm perfect at it now, but I can do a bit of one.

01:10:02.660 --> 01:10:04.660
So I ended up seeing this girl.

01:10:04.660 --> 01:10:06.660
You dodged that.

01:10:06.660 --> 01:10:08.660
I can do it.

01:10:08.660 --> 01:10:10.660
I will only do it, mate.

01:10:10.660 --> 01:10:12.660
Can I have your wee chubby?

01:10:14.660 --> 01:10:16.660
Your scoffy wee twat.

01:10:16.660 --> 01:10:18.660
See, usually in the UK,

01:10:18.660 --> 01:10:22.660
the order of pecking is just Scotland.

01:10:22.660 --> 01:10:24.660
So I just feel immediately intimidated by that.

01:10:24.660 --> 01:10:26.660
What I love about Scottish people is that

01:10:26.660 --> 01:10:28.660
in Japanese, people get excited.

01:10:28.660 --> 01:10:30.660
You watch old Japanese films and they get excited.

01:10:30.660 --> 01:10:32.660
Ooh, they get low.

01:10:32.660 --> 01:10:34.660
They get guttural.

01:10:34.660 --> 01:10:36.660
In Scottish,

01:10:36.660 --> 01:10:38.660
if it goes ever since you've been up here,

01:10:38.660 --> 01:10:40.660
you're going to be real for sale.

01:10:40.660 --> 01:10:42.660
So I ended up seeing this goddamn chick

01:10:42.660 --> 01:10:44.660
every place I went

01:10:44.660 --> 01:10:46.660
for the rest of my life.

01:10:46.660 --> 01:10:48.660
So we

01:10:48.660 --> 01:10:50.660
spent an hour lying to her

01:10:50.660 --> 01:10:52.660
and she would come in and I'd be at a bar and I'd go,

01:10:52.660 --> 01:10:54.660
I'd be with somebody and I'd go, oh fuck, I'm Scottish.

01:10:54.660 --> 01:10:56.660
Hey, how are you?

01:10:56.660 --> 01:10:58.660
I saw her. Good to see you again.

01:10:58.660 --> 01:11:00.660
And she would bring friends.

01:11:00.660 --> 01:11:02.660
I was my friend from Scotland, from Aberdeen.

01:11:02.660 --> 01:11:04.660
It was Christ. And then she had friends

01:11:04.660 --> 01:11:06.660
that had been to Scotland.

01:11:06.660 --> 01:11:08.660
They knew more about it than I did. It was a bummer.

01:11:08.660 --> 01:11:10.660
So finally I was so tired.

01:11:10.660 --> 01:11:12.660
I'm saying a fucking year goes by

01:11:12.660 --> 01:11:14.660
where I would see her every eight days.

01:11:14.660 --> 01:11:16.660
Wherever I went, there was only like

01:11:16.660 --> 01:11:18.660
five cool bars to go to back then.

01:11:18.660 --> 01:11:20.660
And so I would see her everywhere.

01:11:20.660 --> 01:11:22.660
Her name was Mouse.

01:11:22.660 --> 01:11:24.660
Or as I said, Moose.

01:11:24.660 --> 01:11:26.660
There was a moose loose.

01:11:26.660 --> 01:11:28.660
So yeah, if you're Scottish, you're not.

01:11:28.660 --> 01:11:30.660
So one day she comes in and I was so fucking tired

01:11:30.660 --> 01:11:32.660
of this charade.

01:11:32.660 --> 01:11:34.660
And she goes, hey Jeff, how are you doing?

01:11:34.660 --> 01:11:36.660
I go, good, how are you doing?

01:11:36.660 --> 01:11:38.660
And she's like, she kind of cocks like,

01:11:38.660 --> 01:11:40.660
I'm good, how are things?

01:11:40.660 --> 01:11:42.660
Things are great.

01:11:42.660 --> 01:11:44.660
Just having a drink.

01:11:44.660 --> 01:11:46.660
And I think she's like, where's your accent?

01:11:46.660 --> 01:11:48.660
I said, look, I'm an actor.

01:11:48.660 --> 01:11:50.660
And my acting coach told me

01:11:50.660 --> 01:11:52.660
that if you want to get rules,

01:11:52.660 --> 01:11:54.660
you can't just go in with a Scottish accent.

01:11:54.660 --> 01:11:56.660
So I have to practice my American

01:11:56.660 --> 01:11:58.660
all the time.

01:11:58.660 --> 01:12:00.660
Because I felt,

01:12:00.660 --> 01:12:02.660
this is me trying to be a good person.

01:12:02.660 --> 01:12:04.660
I was fucking with you.

01:12:04.660 --> 01:12:06.660
For some reason that gets me closer

01:12:06.660 --> 01:12:08.660
to the mark then.

01:12:08.660 --> 01:12:10.660
I would rather you do that.

01:12:10.660 --> 01:12:12.660
So I'm trying to, also I'm hoping,

01:12:12.660 --> 01:12:14.660
I'm just going to move to a different state

01:12:14.660 --> 01:12:16.660
so this doesn't have to keep happening.

01:12:16.660 --> 01:12:18.660
So I go, it's better to practice it

01:12:18.660 --> 01:12:20.660
all the time and that way

01:12:20.660 --> 01:12:22.660
when you go into the room, you're ready

01:12:22.660 --> 01:12:24.660
with your American dialect.

01:12:24.660 --> 01:12:26.660
And she goes, okay, say something.

01:12:26.660 --> 01:12:28.660
It's like an accent. I go, what should I say?

01:12:28.660 --> 01:12:30.660
And she goes, I say, I want a hamburger

01:12:30.660 --> 01:12:32.660
and fries. I go, I want a hamburger

01:12:32.660 --> 01:12:34.660
and fries. And she looks at me and she goes,

01:12:34.660 --> 01:12:36.660
that's pretty good.

01:12:40.660 --> 01:12:42.660
Alright.

01:12:42.660 --> 01:12:44.660
I since years later ran into her

01:12:44.660 --> 01:12:46.660
and told her the truth, that the whole thing was safe.

01:12:46.660 --> 01:12:48.660
And she's here tonight.

01:12:48.660 --> 01:12:50.660
And she's got a gun! She's got a gun!

01:12:50.660 --> 01:12:52.660
Now, she's dead.

01:12:52.660 --> 01:12:54.660
That woman's name? Nancy Reagan.

01:12:54.660 --> 01:12:56.660
No!

01:12:56.660 --> 01:12:58.660
No!

01:12:58.660 --> 01:13:00.660
No!

01:13:00.660 --> 01:13:02.660
No!

01:13:05.660 --> 01:13:10.660
That's been our show. Goodnight Drive safely, everybody.

01:13:10.660 --> 01:13:12.660
Just say life's a circle!

01:13:12.660 --> 01:13:14.660
Alright, back to role-playing.

01:13:14.660 --> 01:13:16.660
Dan, where does role-play for you?

01:13:16.660 --> 01:13:18.660
What's the funkiest, the most specific role-play?

01:13:18.660 --> 01:13:20.660
The most complicated design?

01:13:20.660 --> 01:13:22.660
Art departments...

01:13:22.660 --> 01:13:27.660
like setup, like how much lead time did it have to have?

01:13:27.660 --> 01:13:32.660
I am not at liberty to discuss my sexual role-playing because it's too hot.

01:13:34.660 --> 01:13:37.660
Are you afraid that we can't handle it? Is that hot?

01:13:37.660 --> 01:13:42.660
No, it's just too... I have discovered recently after, you know,

01:13:42.660 --> 01:13:45.660
after living my life going like, I wish, you know, when I was on the playground,

01:13:45.660 --> 01:13:50.660
it was like, hey, hey kid, why you get boogers on your jacket?

01:13:50.660 --> 01:13:54.660
Well, how can you talk that way, walk that way, and pee that way,

01:13:54.660 --> 01:13:58.660
and throw a ball that way, and write that way, and talk that way, and think that way?

01:13:58.660 --> 01:14:01.660
How can I smell that way, and behave in all that way?

01:14:01.660 --> 01:14:04.660
Why are you doing all those things? Why are you doing that?

01:14:04.660 --> 01:14:07.660
And I'd always be like, fuck, god damn it, it's such a bummer, all that happens,

01:14:07.660 --> 01:14:10.660
and I'm like, fuck it, god damn it, I'm gonna make sure that the answer to that

01:14:10.660 --> 01:14:12.660
is always because I'm awesome.

01:14:12.660 --> 01:14:15.660
And I just like, just getting more and more tastes of it,

01:14:15.660 --> 01:14:17.660
and just going like, no, you're gonna fucking kneel before me,

01:14:17.660 --> 01:14:21.660
and then I was like, why is that the answer is gonna be, why aren't you doing this,

01:14:21.660 --> 01:14:23.660
this way, and that way, and that way?

01:14:23.660 --> 01:14:25.660
And then along the way, it was sort of like caught up in this sort of like,

01:14:25.660 --> 01:14:31.660
well, the big key to that is like public, you know, spotlight transparency.

01:14:31.660 --> 01:14:35.660
Like there should be no barrier between what's going on in your head,

01:14:35.660 --> 01:14:38.660
and what's coming out of your mouth, and what's going on behind closed doors,

01:14:38.660 --> 01:14:41.660
and because that's everybody else's jam, because they're all ashamed of themselves,

01:14:41.660 --> 01:14:43.660
and they're all terrible people, they're shadow people,

01:14:43.660 --> 01:14:45.660
and they want you to be merged with their shadows,

01:14:45.660 --> 01:14:47.660
and you're just gonna be honest, and you're gonna be who you are,

01:14:47.660 --> 01:14:50.660
and you're gonna flaunt who you are, and they're gonna not kill you,

01:14:50.660 --> 01:14:52.660
and that's when you're gonna know you succeed.

01:14:52.660 --> 01:14:55.660
Then I spent my life like tricking people into situations where they're tempted

01:14:55.660 --> 01:14:58.660
to try to kill me so I can prove that they can't, so I can be alive,

01:14:58.660 --> 01:15:02.660
and consider myself a success, and it's just this fucking syndrome,

01:15:02.660 --> 01:15:07.660
and then I, you know, and it culminated in like a public relationship,

01:15:07.660 --> 01:15:12.660
and I got married, and now I'm divorced, and it was like, none of it matters,

01:15:12.660 --> 01:15:17.660
and then I got like, oh, what if where you put your dick,

01:15:17.660 --> 01:15:20.660
and what you did with it, and what made it hard, and when it came,

01:15:20.660 --> 01:15:24.660
and where you shot the cum, like what if that was like kind of like, I don't know,

01:15:24.660 --> 01:15:27.660
what if there was a little bit of a box around that,

01:15:27.660 --> 01:15:32.660
what if you made a box around here, and what if everybody that you knew intimately,

01:15:32.660 --> 01:15:37.660
like there was a box around them, and it's like, oh, I guess that would be called privacy,

01:15:37.660 --> 01:15:43.660
and then you could just like, yeah, I mean, I wish, I want nothing more than to be able

01:15:43.660 --> 01:15:46.660
to tell people like what I get up to when I fuck,

01:15:46.660 --> 01:15:53.660
but the fact is society couldn't handle it, and that's why I'm able to cum,

01:15:53.660 --> 01:15:57.660
that's the only thing that could ever make me cum, so if I told you, you'd be like,

01:15:57.660 --> 01:16:01.660
whoa, and then I'd be like, and then my dick would be like, meh,

01:16:01.660 --> 01:16:05.660
so then I'd have to go further, and then I'd be like, I'm hard,

01:16:05.660 --> 01:16:09.660
and you'd be like, that's crazy, and I'm like, yep, it was,

01:16:09.660 --> 01:16:14.660
and then so I'm in a sweet spot, I got some tricks, I got some costumes.

01:16:14.660 --> 01:16:18.660
I admire you like having that privacy for yourself, that's good.

01:16:18.660 --> 01:16:23.660
Yeah, your sexuality like should be sexy, and it should be your own dirty little secret.

01:16:23.660 --> 01:16:30.660
I go to criminal places, terrible, low, ethically horrible places.

01:16:30.660 --> 01:16:35.660
I'm not coming until like, well that's not true.

01:16:35.660 --> 01:16:39.660
All the time it's like, you know, I just want to make sure,

01:16:39.660 --> 01:16:42.660
because it's like, whoa, what if you can only go to that place?

01:16:42.660 --> 01:16:48.660
No, but I'm saying like, I go to terrible, terrible, dark, dark crevices

01:16:48.660 --> 01:16:55.660
of the human imagination, because you're not supposed to.

01:16:55.660 --> 01:16:59.660
But with somebody who's consensually into that too.

01:16:59.660 --> 01:17:03.660
No, God, no, consent, no.

01:17:03.660 --> 01:17:06.660
No, oh God, no, Jeff, that's the whole point.

01:17:06.660 --> 01:17:10.660
Yes, yes!

01:17:10.660 --> 01:17:15.660
With a consent to good dogs.

01:17:15.660 --> 01:17:20.660
Yes, but it's horrible, and there's really no way it never wouldn't be horrible.

01:17:20.660 --> 01:17:25.660
Like, that's a thing, it's like, oh, let's all live in this society

01:17:25.660 --> 01:17:28.660
where we all kind of talk about everything, and all the language is monitored,

01:17:28.660 --> 01:17:31.660
and if you say this, then you intend this, but that's not really true,

01:17:31.660 --> 01:17:33.660
because we know that the people that are really good at saying things right

01:17:33.660 --> 01:17:35.660
are some of the worst people in the world.

01:17:35.660 --> 01:17:38.660
And then we're down here policing each other's language,

01:17:38.660 --> 01:17:40.660
because we're so caught up in the idea of language being intent,

01:17:40.660 --> 01:17:43.660
but we're still disguising it down here, because when you get behind closed doors,

01:17:43.660 --> 01:17:47.660
it's all about, like, it's thought, and it's intent and stuff,

01:17:47.660 --> 01:17:50.660
and it's like, the way you treat each other, it should be,

01:17:50.660 --> 01:17:55.660
I don't know where to go with that, but it's a lot of babysitter stuff.

01:17:55.660 --> 01:18:01.660
That's a short answer, the short answer is babysitter stuff.

01:18:01.660 --> 01:18:06.660
Short answer is it's a lot of babysitter stuff, but, you know, it's beyond that.

01:18:06.660 --> 01:18:10.660
Okay, that's the baseline.

01:18:10.660 --> 01:18:12.660
Thanks for taking care of my kids.

01:18:12.660 --> 01:18:14.660
Have you ever dressed up either yourself or your...

01:18:14.660 --> 01:18:15.660
No, my wife's working at the hospital.

01:18:15.660 --> 01:18:19.660
Have you ever dressed up as yourself or your Leva, as you call her?

01:18:19.660 --> 01:18:23.660
In period costume, have you ever gone into a different era?

01:18:23.660 --> 01:18:27.660
Well, yes, the 80s.

01:18:27.660 --> 01:18:36.660
Yes, my high school, yes.

01:18:36.660 --> 01:18:38.660
Okay, that's good, I like that.

01:18:38.660 --> 01:18:42.660
But, no, nothing, no dangerous liaisons, kind of like,

01:18:42.660 --> 01:18:44.660
oh, Oscar-worthy stuff, yes.

01:18:44.660 --> 01:18:47.660
William, do you go into the costume realm?

01:18:47.660 --> 01:18:51.660
Yeah, well, as an actor, what I get is I get the...

01:18:51.660 --> 01:18:54.660
What's your favorite film that you've been in?

01:18:54.660 --> 01:18:57.660
Oh, The Independence Day.

01:18:57.660 --> 01:18:58.660
Alright.

01:18:58.660 --> 01:19:00.660
See, we're role-playing right now.

01:19:00.660 --> 01:19:02.660
The Independence Day.

01:19:02.660 --> 01:19:03.660
Yeah, The Independence Day.

01:19:03.660 --> 01:19:04.660
Hello, yeah.

01:19:04.660 --> 01:19:07.660
Yeah.

01:19:07.660 --> 01:19:11.660
How did people in England...

01:19:11.660 --> 01:19:14.660
That was a hit movie, I'm assuming it was kind of a global...

01:19:14.660 --> 01:19:18.660
Like, somebody in London must have wanted to go see Independence Day.

01:19:18.660 --> 01:19:21.660
Well, you were not born for 80 years.

01:19:21.660 --> 01:19:24.660
So, I guess I'm not, I'm asking the wrong person,

01:19:24.660 --> 01:19:26.660
but I'm just curious, they're like, oh,

01:19:26.660 --> 01:19:28.660
there's another big American Explodum-up movie,

01:19:28.660 --> 01:19:31.660
and then it's just like, this is our Independence Day.

01:19:31.660 --> 01:19:34.660
I'm like, well, alright.

01:19:34.660 --> 01:19:36.660
Yeah, rub it in.

01:19:36.660 --> 01:19:39.660
Can't aliens attack and it not be about this fucking thing

01:19:39.660 --> 01:19:40.660
you keep bringing up?

01:19:40.660 --> 01:19:43.660
We used to rule the world down.

01:19:43.660 --> 01:19:44.660
Not anymore.

01:19:44.660 --> 01:19:45.660
Like those aliens?

01:19:45.660 --> 01:19:50.660
The aliens were an allegory for the British.

01:19:50.660 --> 01:19:52.660
But don't you think the British pilots,

01:19:52.660 --> 01:19:55.660
because right there are a bunch of international pilots on that tarmac,

01:19:55.660 --> 01:19:57.660
when Bill Pullman's making the speech of that movie,

01:19:57.660 --> 01:19:59.660
isn't there like a good...

01:19:59.660 --> 01:20:02.660
They should have a shot of like 20 British guys

01:20:02.660 --> 01:20:04.660
pulling off flight helmets and going like,

01:20:04.660 --> 01:20:08.660
you know what, if you're going to make it fucking complicated for us,

01:20:08.660 --> 01:20:10.660
how did it sign on to this allegory?

01:20:10.660 --> 01:20:13.660
And that scene is absolutely ripping off Shakespeare,

01:20:13.660 --> 01:20:15.660
that's the St. Crispin's Day speech.

01:20:15.660 --> 01:20:19.660
So like, yeah, that's in your face, England.

01:20:19.660 --> 01:20:20.660
Hey!

01:20:20.660 --> 01:20:22.660
No, I'm on your side.

01:20:22.660 --> 01:20:25.660
I think that's us needlessly rubbing it in.

01:20:25.660 --> 01:20:29.660
Did you know that Shakespeare invented the word eyeball?

01:20:29.660 --> 01:20:34.660
Oh, God, he's going to bring this up again.

01:20:34.660 --> 01:20:36.660
You guys are stepping at each other.

01:20:36.660 --> 01:20:37.660
Is that true?

01:20:37.660 --> 01:20:38.660
Yes.

01:20:38.660 --> 01:20:40.660
Yeah, is it true?

01:20:40.660 --> 01:20:42.660
Yes, eyeball.

01:20:42.660 --> 01:20:44.660
Can you make up the word bump?

01:20:44.660 --> 01:20:45.660
Yes, bump.

01:20:45.660 --> 01:20:47.660
Amazement, compromise.

01:20:47.660 --> 01:20:48.660
Uncomfortable.

01:20:48.660 --> 01:20:51.660
Uncomfortable, except comfortable already existed.

01:20:51.660 --> 01:20:53.660
So, partial credit.

01:20:53.660 --> 01:20:54.660
We'll give it to him.

01:20:54.660 --> 01:20:57.660
This is a promotion for my new show, Great Minds, on the History Channel.

01:20:57.660 --> 01:21:04.660
Now, here's where I...

01:21:04.660 --> 01:21:06.660
Here's my beef with Shakespeare.

01:21:06.660 --> 01:21:08.660
Because of Iambic pentameter...

01:21:08.660 --> 01:21:09.660
Here we go.

01:21:09.660 --> 01:21:14.660
Because of Iambic pentameter's strict rules, it has to be Romeo, Romeo.

01:21:14.660 --> 01:21:15.660
Where for art the Roman...

01:21:15.660 --> 01:21:16.660
It's Romeo.

01:21:16.660 --> 01:21:20.660
But you can't say Romeo because it fucks up the Iambic pentameter.

01:21:20.660 --> 01:21:22.660
No one wants to say Romeo.

01:21:22.660 --> 01:21:23.660
Yeah.

01:21:23.660 --> 01:21:24.660
They're from Italy.

01:21:24.660 --> 01:21:25.660
They're from Italy.

01:21:25.660 --> 01:21:26.660
No one in Italy calls it...

01:21:26.660 --> 01:21:29.660
Yeah, if they would have called it Romeo, it would have been famous.

01:21:29.660 --> 01:21:34.660
It would have been huge.

01:21:34.660 --> 01:21:35.660
They would have got that right.

01:21:35.660 --> 01:21:38.660
Now, Rob, back to your biscuits.

01:21:38.660 --> 01:21:39.660
Delicious.

01:21:39.660 --> 01:21:42.660
You say you put jam on them, but I think they're fine just on their own.

01:21:42.660 --> 01:21:44.660
You know, I don't think it needs any help.

01:21:44.660 --> 01:21:45.660
They are.

01:21:45.660 --> 01:21:47.660
They are quite good if you heat them up.

01:21:47.660 --> 01:21:48.660
How much...

01:21:48.660 --> 01:21:49.660
What do you set the oven to?

01:21:49.660 --> 01:21:52.660
Great Minds on History Channel.

01:21:52.660 --> 01:21:53.660
425.

01:21:53.660 --> 01:21:55.660
It's a good show.

01:21:55.660 --> 01:21:56.660
Do we...

01:21:56.660 --> 01:21:57.660
We don't have it.

01:21:57.660 --> 01:21:58.660
No, not.

01:21:58.660 --> 01:21:59.660
Spencer is great on history.

01:21:59.660 --> 01:22:00.660
Let's roll the clip.

01:22:00.660 --> 01:22:01.660
Watch Great Minds on History.

01:22:01.660 --> 01:22:02.660
Yeah, let's roll the clip.

01:22:02.660 --> 01:22:03.660
Let's roll the clip.

01:22:03.660 --> 01:22:04.660
Let's roll the clip.

01:22:04.660 --> 01:22:05.660
What are we watching?

01:22:05.660 --> 01:22:07.660
Do you want to set up the clip?

01:22:07.660 --> 01:22:10.660
Yeah, this is Episode 6.

01:22:10.660 --> 01:22:13.660
We go into the center of the earth.

01:22:13.660 --> 01:22:14.660
Play the clip.

01:22:14.660 --> 01:22:18.660
Fade out, fade down.

01:22:18.660 --> 01:22:23.660
Oh, this is a time machine situation mishap.

01:22:23.660 --> 01:22:27.660
Spenser, why are we at the center of the earth?

01:22:27.660 --> 01:22:29.660
Every time we go to the...

01:22:29.660 --> 01:22:33.660
This happens every time.

01:22:33.660 --> 01:22:38.900
Oh look, out the window, there's a historical figure.

01:22:38.900 --> 01:22:41.900
Why is he down there?

01:22:41.900 --> 01:22:42.900
Looks like it's...

01:22:42.900 --> 01:22:43.900
He's bald.

01:22:43.900 --> 01:22:45.420
It's Billy Zane.

01:22:45.420 --> 01:22:49.940
Hi, I'm Billy...

01:22:49.940 --> 01:22:54.540
Someone called out, it's Billy Zane, and I guess, yeah, it's Billy Zane's out there.

01:22:54.540 --> 01:22:59.060
We can do this the easy way or the hard way.

01:22:59.060 --> 01:23:03.460
He's doing his line from Back to the Future 3.

01:23:03.460 --> 01:23:04.460
How long, William?

01:23:04.460 --> 01:23:05.460
You're going to get a part.

01:23:05.460 --> 01:23:10.820
I've got to say, I've only seen 14 episodes of Harmonton, and the first four.

01:23:10.820 --> 01:23:12.420
Oh no, it's okay, you don't have to be a fan.

01:23:12.420 --> 01:23:13.420
This is going to be...

01:23:13.420 --> 01:23:14.420
No, no, no.

01:23:14.420 --> 01:23:15.420
I don't know, are you clearly set up a bit?

01:23:15.420 --> 01:23:16.420
And I don't know what the bit is.

01:23:16.420 --> 01:23:17.420
I'm sorry.

01:23:17.420 --> 01:23:18.420
And now I'm interrupting it.

01:23:18.420 --> 01:23:19.420
No, no, no.

01:23:19.420 --> 01:23:20.420
I'll catch it.

01:23:20.420 --> 01:23:21.420
I'll catch it.

01:23:21.420 --> 01:23:22.420
I'll catch it.

01:23:22.420 --> 01:23:23.420
It's just bad input.

01:23:23.420 --> 01:23:24.420
There's nothing more.

01:23:24.420 --> 01:23:26.500
We're going to give you a historical figure to play.

01:23:26.500 --> 01:23:30.180
If you could play any character from history, anybody at all, who would it be?

01:23:30.180 --> 01:23:31.180
Margaret Thatcher.

01:23:31.180 --> 01:23:32.180
Okay.

01:23:32.180 --> 01:23:33.980
I fucking knew it.

01:23:33.980 --> 01:23:34.980
I knew it.

01:23:34.980 --> 01:23:35.980
The Iron Lady.

01:23:35.980 --> 01:23:36.980
Yes.

01:23:36.980 --> 01:23:37.980
Yes.

01:23:37.980 --> 01:23:38.980
All right.

01:23:38.980 --> 01:23:43.580
So we'll cue you, you'll know when you're coming into the scene, and think of it like

01:23:43.580 --> 01:23:44.580
it's a radio play.

01:23:44.580 --> 01:23:48.460
Oh, this is a woman brace, thank you.

01:23:48.460 --> 01:23:53.180
All right, so we're in a drill, we're at the center of the earth, we just saw Billy Zane.

01:23:53.180 --> 01:23:55.180
Look what's right next to Billy Zane.

01:23:55.180 --> 01:23:56.180
Oh.

01:23:56.180 --> 01:23:57.860
Is that the Iron Lady?

01:23:57.860 --> 01:24:03.460
Let's, let's listen and see what she's saying.

01:24:03.460 --> 01:24:04.460
Hello.

01:24:04.460 --> 01:24:09.180
Oh, she's, she's, we're drowning.

01:24:09.180 --> 01:24:10.180
We should pick her up.

01:24:10.180 --> 01:24:11.180
Oh, thanks.

01:24:11.180 --> 01:24:12.180
Yeah.

01:24:12.180 --> 01:24:13.180
Yeah.

01:24:13.180 --> 01:24:14.180
Thank you.

01:24:14.180 --> 01:24:15.180
Get in here, Iron Lady.

01:24:15.180 --> 01:24:16.180
Oh, yeah.

01:24:16.180 --> 01:24:17.180
All right.

01:24:17.180 --> 01:24:19.980
Uh, strap into the, into the cargo bay and let's get you.

01:24:19.980 --> 01:24:23.820
I'm strapping the fucking right now.

01:24:23.820 --> 01:24:25.460
Let's get you back up topside.

01:24:25.460 --> 01:24:30.620
Uh, I guess I don't need any help.

01:24:30.620 --> 01:24:38.620
Just, you just left Billy Zane in the center of the earth.

01:24:38.620 --> 01:24:41.940
There's only three seats in the center of the earth.

01:24:41.940 --> 01:24:42.940
That's fine.

01:24:42.940 --> 01:24:43.940
All right.

01:24:43.940 --> 01:24:44.940
Here we are back.

01:24:44.940 --> 01:24:52.460
I was in, uh, this season, Spencer, either you have to get out with Margaret Thatcher

01:24:52.460 --> 01:24:58.340
and I'll go back down and get Billy Zane or you leave the, you leave the, you leave the

01:24:58.340 --> 01:25:01.340
fox with the chicken feed.

01:25:01.340 --> 01:25:05.140
Why don't you leave the, will you go down and get Billy Zane?

01:25:05.140 --> 01:25:06.140
Oh yeah.

01:25:06.140 --> 01:25:07.460
I'll go, I'll, I'll be right back.

01:25:07.460 --> 01:25:08.460
You guys sit here.

01:25:08.460 --> 01:25:10.740
I'll, I'll drive off in the mobile.

01:25:10.740 --> 01:25:14.180
I smell, I smell double, double podcast coming on right now.

01:25:14.180 --> 01:25:21.340
It looks like he, it looks like we've come up of ground here in Kentucky.

01:25:21.340 --> 01:25:26.300
Billy Thatcher, you look, you look, you look terrible and no, you've been, no, you've been,

01:25:26.300 --> 01:25:29.100
I mean, it's like you've been through a lot.

01:25:29.100 --> 01:25:32.700
Let's get you, let's get you clothed and fed.

01:25:32.700 --> 01:25:33.700
I'm clothed.

01:25:33.700 --> 01:25:36.140
What are you talking about?

01:25:36.140 --> 01:25:41.860
Let's get you a new change of clothes, not all lava and dirt is up and, uh, and then

01:25:41.860 --> 01:25:43.660
we'll go get you some food.

01:25:43.660 --> 01:25:44.660
Oh thanks.

01:25:44.660 --> 01:25:45.660
Thank you.

01:25:45.660 --> 01:25:48.660
Clip, clop, clip, clop, clop, clop.

01:25:48.660 --> 01:25:49.660
Billy Zane.

01:25:49.660 --> 01:25:51.940
Are you down here?

01:25:51.940 --> 01:25:52.940

01:25:52.940 --> 01:25:55.420
Uh, do you got help me?

01:25:55.420 --> 01:25:56.420

Help me please.

They left me behind and help me, my leg's broken, my bone's sticking out of my leg,

01:26:10.100 --> 01:26:11.620
it hurts so much.

01:26:11.620 --> 01:26:13.100
Help me, please, help me.

01:26:13.100 --> 01:26:17.100
Why were, if that was the case, why were you just quoting earlier lines you've done

01:26:17.100 --> 01:26:18.100
the last time we counted you?

01:26:18.100 --> 01:26:25.140
I'm serious for the pain, what are you, you're, you're questioning me, the bone is sticking

01:26:25.140 --> 01:26:29.940
out of my leg, you're, you don't like how I was speaking before when you left me?

01:26:29.940 --> 01:26:36.820
Yeah, no, it's really souring my, uh, my benevolence here, I'm gonna, I'm gonna get

01:26:36.820 --> 01:26:37.820
out of here.

01:26:37.820 --> 01:26:46.500
No, you can leave me a second time, please help me, I'm Billy Zane, I loved you on season

01:27:10.940 --> 01:27:13.940
No, no, I think I prefer the blue one actually, you know.

01:27:13.940 --> 01:27:19.180
Right, well, let's, excuse me, I hope, uh, don't interrupt you, but we're, we're about

01:27:19.180 --> 01:27:20.180
to close the store.

01:27:20.180 --> 01:27:22.860
Look, we're gonna need a bit more time, all right?

01:27:22.860 --> 01:27:30.700
All right, well here's the keys, oh, thanks, turn the lights off and lock the door, yeah,

01:27:52.080 --> 01:28:01.260
untying, untying, untying, untying, untying, untying, untying, untying, untying, untying,

01:28:01.260 --> 01:28:03.300
untying, untying, untying, untying, untying, untying, untying, untying, untying, untying,

01:28:03.300 --> 01:28:07.600
untying, untying, untying, untying, untying, untying, untying, untying, untying, untying,

01:28:07.600 --> 01:28:11.600
No, that's been elaborately set up, so we're gonna fucking case this joint.

01:28:11.600 --> 01:28:12.600
Maggie.

01:28:12.600 --> 01:28:13.600
Yeah, what?

01:28:13.600 --> 01:28:14.600
What?

01:28:14.600 --> 01:28:15.600
He just put his trust in us.

01:28:15.600 --> 01:28:16.600
What a girl wants.

01:28:16.600 --> 01:28:17.600
What a girl needs.

01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:19.600
What a British public trust in me.

01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:20.600
Montage.

01:28:20.600 --> 01:28:25.600
Montage of trying on clothes and then stealing things.

01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:27.600
Margaret Thatcher!

01:28:27.600 --> 01:28:29.600
You're corrupting me.

01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:33.600
Yeah, I corrupted the fucking British morale, but you know.

01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:36.600
Oh, I'm gonna fuck about that.

01:28:36.600 --> 01:28:40.600
Shots fired!

01:28:40.600 --> 01:28:52.600
All right, and all culminates in us finishing filling up bags with cash, and also you come out of the dressing room in the perfect dress, and I'm like, that's the one.

01:28:52.600 --> 01:28:55.600
And then we run out to the parking lot and we...

01:28:55.600 --> 01:28:57.600
I just forgot my lunchbox, but...

01:28:57.600 --> 01:29:00.600
Oh, shh.

01:29:00.600 --> 01:29:02.600
What the heck?

01:29:02.600 --> 01:29:04.600
I'm just me, I think.

01:29:04.600 --> 01:29:07.600
All right, then, you're gonna have to fucking take this person out.

01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:08.600
No, Margaret.

01:29:08.600 --> 01:29:11.600
These are the trash bags that I left there, and what's the exact...

01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:12.600
Go to waste this fool.

01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:13.600
All of the fendies and...

01:29:13.600 --> 01:29:16.600
Waste this fool!

01:29:16.600 --> 01:29:17.600
Hit!

01:29:17.600 --> 01:29:18.600
Ha!

01:29:18.600 --> 01:29:22.600
Piano wire that I stole from the piano section of your store.

01:29:22.600 --> 01:29:23.600
Oh, yeah.

01:29:23.600 --> 01:29:24.600
Around your throat, around your throat.

01:29:24.600 --> 01:29:25.600
My neck is over there.

01:29:25.600 --> 01:29:28.600
I don't...

01:29:28.600 --> 01:29:29.600
What?

01:29:29.600 --> 01:29:31.600
You're some kind of magician.

01:29:31.600 --> 01:29:32.600
Hit!

01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:33.600
Hit!

01:29:33.600 --> 01:29:34.600
Oh!

01:29:34.600 --> 01:29:35.600
Oh!

01:29:35.600 --> 01:29:36.600
Hit!

01:29:36.600 --> 01:29:37.600
Oh, my gosh.

01:29:37.600 --> 01:29:38.600
Oh, my gosh.

01:29:38.600 --> 01:29:39.600
Hit!

01:29:39.600 --> 01:29:40.600
Oh, my gosh.

01:29:40.600 --> 01:29:41.600
What are you doing?

01:29:41.600 --> 01:29:44.600
Well, I'm choking you to death.

01:29:44.600 --> 01:29:48.600
Oh, a big choke.

01:29:48.600 --> 01:29:51.600
He's imagining you're in front of him right now.

01:29:51.600 --> 01:29:52.600
Okay, all right.

01:29:52.600 --> 01:29:53.600
Okay.

01:29:53.600 --> 01:29:56.600
Why would you steal my money after that?

01:29:56.600 --> 01:29:59.600
Why are you killing me when I caught you?

01:29:59.600 --> 01:30:02.600
I trusted you.

01:30:02.600 --> 01:30:12.600
That's why you don't buy piano wires in Abercrombie and Fitch.

01:30:12.600 --> 01:30:17.600
You can't kill somebody with those.

01:30:17.600 --> 01:30:18.600
All right.

01:30:18.600 --> 01:30:24.600
Margaret Thatcher, go kneel behind him and I'll push you over his back on the count

01:30:24.600 --> 01:30:28.600
of three and then we'll run because he'll have fallen down.

01:30:28.600 --> 01:30:34.600
So, anyways, just out here stargazing and...

01:30:34.600 --> 01:30:36.600
Oh, shit.

01:30:36.600 --> 01:30:37.600
Billy Zane!

01:30:37.600 --> 01:30:38.600
Yes!

01:30:38.600 --> 01:30:51.600
It took 11 minutes for me to crawl up here, but I'm finally going to get my revenge on

01:30:51.600 --> 01:30:54.600
you, Margaret Thatcher, for breaking my heart.

01:30:54.600 --> 01:30:56.600
Oh, fucking hell.

01:30:56.600 --> 01:30:57.600
Yes.

01:30:57.600 --> 01:30:59.600
That's what we're going to do.

01:30:59.600 --> 01:31:01.600
Come with me, Margaret Thatcher.

01:31:01.600 --> 01:31:02.600
Oh, no.

01:31:02.600 --> 01:31:05.600
We're going to fucking hell.

01:31:05.600 --> 01:31:07.600
Later in hell.

01:31:07.600 --> 01:31:09.600
Yes!

01:31:19.600 --> 01:31:21.600
These are your legs.

01:31:21.600 --> 01:31:23.600
Oh, yes.

01:31:23.600 --> 01:31:26.600
Invade me like the Falkland Islands.

01:31:26.600 --> 01:31:28.600
Yes!

01:31:28.600 --> 01:31:30.600
Oh, yes.

01:31:30.600 --> 01:31:34.600
And I'm the devil and I'm whipping you both.

01:31:34.600 --> 01:31:39.600
And I'm like, yeah, keep fucking.

01:31:39.600 --> 01:31:42.600
And I'm kind of like getting suspicious.

01:31:42.600 --> 01:31:45.600
I'm like, wait a minute.

01:31:45.600 --> 01:31:49.600
Who's taking advantage of who here?

01:31:49.600 --> 01:31:55.600
Keep fucking, keep fucking Billy Zane, Margaret Thatcher.

01:31:55.600 --> 01:32:00.600
And then I walk back...

01:32:00.600 --> 01:32:06.600
I'm walking back to my devil office.

01:32:06.600 --> 01:32:08.600
And I'm demoralized.

01:32:08.600 --> 01:32:11.600
I'm like, I don't even know.

01:32:11.600 --> 01:32:13.600
Hey, honey, why do you look so blue?

01:32:13.600 --> 01:32:16.600
Stephanie, could you hold all my calls?

01:32:16.600 --> 01:32:21.600
Okay, but you have a full inbox of a lot of important devil things to do.

01:32:21.600 --> 01:32:24.600
Yeah, but could you just come to my office and just hear me out?

01:32:24.600 --> 01:32:26.600
This isn't going to be one of your...

01:32:26.600 --> 01:32:28.600
No, no, no. I swear to God.

01:32:28.600 --> 01:32:30.600
Ever since that lawyer came, like, I don't...

01:32:30.600 --> 01:32:32.600
We had the whole HR seminar about this.

01:32:32.600 --> 01:32:34.600
No, I get it. It's an unfair power dynamic.

01:32:34.600 --> 01:32:36.600
That's the whole point. I can't even go there.

01:32:36.600 --> 01:32:38.600
No matter how many signals you send me, it's unfair to you.

01:32:38.600 --> 01:32:40.600
This is not going to happen. I'm in love with Roderick.

01:32:40.600 --> 01:32:44.600
That's fine. Please don't ever say that again or I'll fire you!

01:32:44.600 --> 01:32:46.600
See, that's exactly why...

01:32:46.600 --> 01:32:48.600
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I pretend you didn't hear that.

01:32:48.600 --> 01:32:49.600
I'm coming into the office.

01:32:49.600 --> 01:32:50.600
I will never fire you.

01:32:50.600 --> 01:32:52.600
I'm sitting over here.

01:32:52.600 --> 01:32:54.600
All right. Stephanie...

01:32:54.600 --> 01:32:56.600
Oh, I'm sorry. My high heel just popped off my...

01:32:56.600 --> 01:32:58.600
The heel of my...

01:33:00.600 --> 01:33:02.600
Let me...

01:33:02.600 --> 01:33:04.600
Let me pop that back on before it dangles there for a while.

01:33:06.600 --> 01:33:08.600
Oops, there she goes again.

01:33:08.600 --> 01:33:10.600
Now I pop it back on.

01:33:10.600 --> 01:33:12.600
Pop!

01:33:12.600 --> 01:33:14.600
Dangle, dangle, dangle, dangle, dangle.

01:33:18.600 --> 01:33:20.600
What is it? What's on your mind?

01:33:20.600 --> 01:33:22.600
Dangle.

01:33:24.600 --> 01:33:26.600
Stephanie...

01:33:26.600 --> 01:33:28.600
Yes?

01:33:28.600 --> 01:33:30.600
I've got two things to say to you.

01:33:30.600 --> 01:33:32.600
What is it, devil?

01:33:32.600 --> 01:33:34.600
I think you lost your shoe!

01:33:34.600 --> 01:33:36.600
And you're fired!

01:33:36.600 --> 01:33:38.600
No, that didn't make me a hero.

01:33:38.600 --> 01:33:40.600
Okay.

01:33:40.600 --> 01:33:42.600
You know what? Stephanie, don't. You're not fired.

01:33:42.600 --> 01:33:44.600
You brought me in the office. I'm assuming for a reason.

01:33:44.600 --> 01:33:46.600
I've got a lot of work to do out here.

01:33:46.600 --> 01:33:48.600
I don't feel like hell is working.

01:33:48.600 --> 01:33:50.600
You used to have an edge because

01:33:50.600 --> 01:33:52.600
you go out there and you're whipping people that enjoy it.

01:33:52.600 --> 01:33:54.600
I've got a lot of people out there.

01:33:54.600 --> 01:33:56.600
I think a lot of people are having more fun in hell than in heaven.

01:33:56.600 --> 01:33:58.600
And I think maybe that you're not

01:33:58.600 --> 01:34:00.600
like a devil.

01:34:00.600 --> 01:34:02.600
Maybe you're secretly...

01:34:02.600 --> 01:34:04.600
You're like a...

01:34:04.600 --> 01:34:06.600
You're like a god.

01:34:06.600 --> 01:34:08.600
Well, doi.

01:34:08.600 --> 01:34:10.600
Don't diminish me.

01:34:10.600 --> 01:34:12.600
I was an angel that loved God too much.

01:34:12.600 --> 01:34:14.600
I got fired from heaven. I don't know how I'm in hell.

01:34:14.600 --> 01:34:16.600
And I'm like...

01:34:16.600 --> 01:34:18.600
I'm not that big.

01:34:18.600 --> 01:34:20.600
It's running without me.

01:34:20.600 --> 01:34:22.600
And it's a bummer.

01:34:22.600 --> 01:34:24.600
I just got done whipping

01:34:24.600 --> 01:34:26.600
politicians.

01:34:26.600 --> 01:34:28.600
Someone's at the door.

01:34:28.600 --> 01:34:30.600
Should I get that? You said hold your calls.

01:34:30.600 --> 01:34:32.600
Yeah, open it.

01:34:32.600 --> 01:34:34.600
Hey, it's me, Pinhead.

01:34:34.600 --> 01:34:36.600
I hate to be a dick

01:34:36.600 --> 01:34:38.600
with a copy machine,

01:34:38.600 --> 01:34:40.600
just still does not have

01:34:40.600 --> 01:34:42.600
enough toner.

01:34:42.600 --> 01:34:44.600
I'm sorry, Stephanie.

01:34:44.600 --> 01:34:46.600
I know. I promised Pinhead

01:34:46.600 --> 01:34:48.600
a long time ago that all his IT problems

01:34:48.600 --> 01:34:50.600
the buck would stop with me.

01:34:52.600 --> 01:34:54.600
It's just ink toner.

01:34:54.600 --> 01:34:56.600
Boss, devil,

01:34:56.600 --> 01:34:58.600
you need to learn

01:34:58.600 --> 01:35:00.600
to relegate

01:35:00.600 --> 01:35:02.600
like things like to delegate.

01:35:02.600 --> 01:35:04.600
Or delegate. And relegate.

01:35:04.600 --> 01:35:06.600
I don't care if you relegate

01:35:06.600 --> 01:35:08.600
or delegate. Get some shit

01:35:08.600 --> 01:35:10.600
Pinhead.

01:35:10.600 --> 01:35:12.600
Pinhead, we talked about your attitude.

01:35:12.600 --> 01:35:14.600
I could copy my shit.

01:35:14.600 --> 01:35:16.600
So I could copy my shit.

01:35:16.600 --> 01:35:18.600
Fuck this job.

01:35:18.600 --> 01:35:20.600
Pinhead!

01:35:22.600 --> 01:35:24.600
Great, great.

01:35:24.600 --> 01:35:26.600
Now he's dissolved through a portal.

01:35:26.600 --> 01:35:28.600
I ain't fucking

01:35:28.600 --> 01:35:30.600
dealing with this shit no more.

01:35:30.600 --> 01:35:32.600
We can only hear him in the walls.

01:35:32.600 --> 01:35:34.600
Shane opens the door.

01:35:34.600 --> 01:35:36.600
Later at a bar. Oh, Pinhead,

01:35:36.600 --> 01:35:38.600
you seem more confident than normal.

01:35:38.600 --> 01:35:40.600
Yeah, well I told my boss

01:35:40.600 --> 01:35:42.600
to fuck himself.

01:35:42.600 --> 01:35:44.600
What are we drinking?

01:35:44.600 --> 01:35:46.600
Give me two of the usual.

01:35:46.600 --> 01:35:48.600
All right.

01:35:48.600 --> 01:35:50.600
Make that one on me.

01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:52.600
Oh, shit.

01:35:54.600 --> 01:35:56.600
Nicole Kidman.

01:36:00.600 --> 01:36:02.600
As I live and breathe.

01:36:02.600 --> 01:36:04.600
Hey, Kidman,

01:36:04.600 --> 01:36:06.600
I told you never to come back to this bar.

01:36:06.600 --> 01:36:08.600
Get the fuck out of here.

01:36:08.600 --> 01:36:10.600
I didn't tell you I couldn't come in

01:36:10.600 --> 01:36:12.600
and buy people drinks.

01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:14.600
I'm leaving.

01:36:14.600 --> 01:36:16.600
I'm leaving. I'm turning into a bat.

01:36:16.600 --> 01:36:18.600
Fucking

01:36:18.600 --> 01:36:20.600
fucking Kidman.

01:36:20.600 --> 01:36:22.600
That fucking Nicole Kidman.

01:36:22.600 --> 01:36:24.600
All over my good time.

01:36:24.600 --> 01:36:26.600
All I get is just

01:36:26.600 --> 01:36:28.600
grief. Grief!

01:36:28.600 --> 01:36:30.600
Do you know how hard I work at this job?

01:36:30.600 --> 01:36:32.600
You work pretty hard.

01:36:32.600 --> 01:36:34.600
I work 16

01:36:34.600 --> 01:36:36.600
hour crunches.

01:36:36.600 --> 01:36:38.600
Too much, man.

01:36:38.600 --> 01:36:40.600
I'm burning out

01:36:40.600 --> 01:36:42.600
and I'm in hell.

01:36:42.600 --> 01:36:44.600
You got to learn

01:36:44.600 --> 01:36:46.600
to smell.

01:36:48.600 --> 01:36:50.600
I hadn't thought about that.

01:36:50.600 --> 01:36:52.600
Pinhead, what are you going to do now?

01:36:52.600 --> 01:36:54.600
You're out of a job, man.

01:36:54.600 --> 01:36:56.600
You guys got to work.

01:36:56.600 --> 01:36:58.600
Butterball and I,

01:36:58.600 --> 01:37:00.600
we're getting together.

01:37:00.600 --> 01:37:02.600
You still hang out with all the Senate Bites?

01:37:02.600 --> 01:37:04.600
You guys all hang out?

01:37:04.600 --> 01:37:06.600
Christmas cards for most of them.

01:37:06.600 --> 01:37:08.600
But Butterball and I are still tight.

01:37:08.600 --> 01:37:10.600
We went to college together.

01:37:10.600 --> 01:37:12.600
You know,

01:37:12.600 --> 01:37:14.600
we've been

01:37:14.600 --> 01:37:16.600
working on this new

01:37:16.600 --> 01:37:18.600
type of

01:37:18.600 --> 01:37:20.600
way to make ceramics.

01:37:20.600 --> 01:37:22.600
For real?

01:37:22.600 --> 01:37:24.600
Yeah, it's new.

01:37:24.600 --> 01:37:26.600
It's all healthy.

01:37:26.600 --> 01:37:28.600
As it stands, ceramics

01:37:28.600 --> 01:37:30.600
is an old, very time consuming

01:37:30.600 --> 01:37:32.600
labor intensive process.

01:37:32.600 --> 01:37:34.600
We've been working on it

01:37:34.600 --> 01:37:36.600
in half the time, half the cost.

01:37:36.600 --> 01:37:38.600
That's what it says on the box.

01:37:38.600 --> 01:37:40.600
Half the time, half the cost.

01:37:40.600 --> 01:37:42.600
You don't have to be waiting for it

01:37:42.600 --> 01:37:44.600
to get out of the oven.

01:37:44.600 --> 01:37:46.600
I have a cup of coffee.

01:37:46.600 --> 01:37:48.600
Can I get into the ground floor of this?

01:37:48.600 --> 01:37:50.600
I'll sell the bar.

01:37:50.600 --> 01:37:52.600
Can I?

01:37:52.600 --> 01:37:54.600
I was going to say, you've got the pizza oven there

01:37:54.600 --> 01:37:56.600
and we can move the video game over there.

01:37:56.600 --> 01:37:58.600
We've got ourselves a business.

01:37:58.600 --> 01:38:00.600
We make the ceramics right here in the bar.

01:38:00.600 --> 01:38:02.600
We're moving up in the world.

01:38:02.600 --> 01:38:04.600
It's a montage to this song.

01:38:04.600 --> 01:38:06.600
Moving up in the world.

01:38:06.600 --> 01:38:08.600
You make ceramics all day long.

01:38:08.600 --> 01:38:10.600
I got that money, money, baby.

01:38:10.600 --> 01:38:12.600
Times are changing all the time.

01:38:12.600 --> 01:38:14.600
I got ceramics all the time.

01:38:14.600 --> 01:38:16.600
And there's a graph showing the ceramic sales

01:38:16.600 --> 01:38:18.600
going up.

01:38:18.600 --> 01:38:20.600
And the bartender and the pinhead

01:38:20.600 --> 01:38:22.600
are being showered with coins.

01:38:22.600 --> 01:38:24.600
Yeah, still a montage

01:38:24.600 --> 01:38:26.600
of people buying ceramics.

01:38:26.600 --> 01:38:28.600
Yeah, just people buying ceramics.

01:38:28.600 --> 01:38:30.600
Now that money goes around.

01:38:30.600 --> 01:38:32.600
I got that money.

01:38:32.600 --> 01:38:34.600
Shopping carts full of aces.

01:38:34.600 --> 01:38:36.600
And then, yeah, okay.

01:38:36.600 --> 01:38:38.600
We've got so much money.

01:38:38.600 --> 01:38:40.600
Can I talk to you

01:38:40.600 --> 01:38:42.600
man to man?

01:38:42.600 --> 01:38:44.600
Okay, let me close the drapes.

01:38:44.600 --> 01:38:46.600
I feel like I'm doing

01:38:46.600 --> 01:38:48.600
all the heavy lifting hairpinhead.

01:38:48.600 --> 01:38:50.600
I feel like, you know...

01:38:50.600 --> 01:38:52.600
My idea.

01:38:52.600 --> 01:38:54.600
My idea.

01:38:54.600 --> 01:38:56.600
We wouldn't be here

01:38:56.600 --> 01:38:58.600
if it wasn't for my idea.

01:38:58.600 --> 01:39:00.600
Yeah, but we wouldn't be here

01:39:00.600 --> 01:39:02.600
if it weren't for all my fucking blood, sweat, and tears.

01:39:02.600 --> 01:39:04.600
Okay, so...

01:39:04.600 --> 01:39:06.600
50-50.

01:39:06.600 --> 01:39:08.600
No, I'm actually taking...

01:39:12.600 --> 01:39:14.600
Somebody's opening the drape.

01:39:14.600 --> 01:39:16.600
Oh, the gates are opening!

01:39:16.600 --> 01:39:18.600
She'll lock the drapes!

01:39:18.600 --> 01:39:20.600
What are you guys talking about?

01:39:20.600 --> 01:39:22.600
Oh, shit!

01:39:22.600 --> 01:39:24.600
Nicole, can we have one?

01:39:24.600 --> 01:39:26.600
Just asking.

01:39:26.600 --> 01:39:28.600
Okay.

01:39:28.600 --> 01:39:30.600
Am I my way to an audition?

01:39:32.600 --> 01:39:34.600
You guys have been giving me the cold shoulder lately.

01:39:34.600 --> 01:39:36.600
No, no, no. Come in, come in. What is it?

01:39:36.600 --> 01:39:38.600
What's on your mind?

01:39:38.600 --> 01:39:40.600
Should I divorce Tom Cruise?

01:39:40.600 --> 01:39:42.600
I mean...

01:39:42.600 --> 01:39:44.600
Do you love him? Oh, shit.

01:39:44.600 --> 01:39:46.600
I'll get it, I'll get it.

01:39:46.600 --> 01:39:48.600
Get the back drapes, some of the back drapes.

01:39:50.600 --> 01:39:52.600
Hello, Nicole. It's Tom.

01:39:52.600 --> 01:39:54.600
Tom?

01:39:54.600 --> 01:39:56.600
Oh, shit.

01:39:56.600 --> 01:39:58.600
We should leave, we should leave. Let's let them talk.

01:39:58.600 --> 01:40:00.600
No, no, stay.

01:40:00.600 --> 01:40:02.600
Tom, whatever you have to say to me,

01:40:02.600 --> 01:40:04.600
you can say in front of my friends.

01:40:10.600 --> 01:40:12.600
You hurt me well enough

01:40:12.600 --> 01:40:14.600
in front of everyone.

01:40:14.600 --> 01:40:16.600
God, this is so...

01:40:16.600 --> 01:40:18.600
You can't leave me, Nicole.

01:40:18.600 --> 01:40:20.600
No, that's the problem, Tom.

01:40:20.600 --> 01:40:22.600
The problem for you.

01:40:22.600 --> 01:40:24.600
It's that I can.

01:40:24.600 --> 01:40:26.600
I'll clean it up and tighten it later.

01:40:28.600 --> 01:40:30.600
Didn't they get divorced

01:40:30.600 --> 01:40:32.600
like 20 years ago?

01:40:32.600 --> 01:40:34.600
Time and...

01:40:34.600 --> 01:40:36.600
This is set in the 80s.

01:40:36.600 --> 01:40:38.600
This is the whole movie.

01:40:38.600 --> 01:40:40.600
In 90s?

01:40:40.600 --> 01:40:42.600
Listen, I love you, Nicole.

01:40:42.600 --> 01:40:44.600
Well, I...

01:40:44.600 --> 01:40:46.600
Yeah, yeah.

01:40:46.600 --> 01:40:48.600
Based for all intents and purposes, I love you.

01:40:48.600 --> 01:40:50.600
That's what I'm afraid of.

01:40:52.600 --> 01:40:54.600
Don't be afraid, Nicole.

01:40:54.600 --> 01:40:56.600
But...

01:40:58.600 --> 01:41:00.600
But what?

01:41:00.600 --> 01:41:02.600
But what?

01:41:04.600 --> 01:41:06.600
But what what?

01:41:12.600 --> 01:41:14.600
What?

01:41:14.600 --> 01:41:16.600
But...

01:41:16.600 --> 01:41:18.600
Are we allowed to leave now?

01:41:18.600 --> 01:41:20.600
What can we do?

01:41:20.600 --> 01:41:24.600
Anything Nicole has to say to me,

01:41:24.600 --> 01:41:26.600
she can say in front of you.

01:41:26.600 --> 01:41:28.600
There's no forward progress in this conversation.

01:41:28.600 --> 01:41:30.600
You guys have to communicate with each other.

01:41:30.600 --> 01:41:32.600
What did I do to you, Nicole?

01:41:32.600 --> 01:41:34.600
You're a bigger fool than I thought

01:41:34.600 --> 01:41:36.600
if you don't know.

01:41:36.600 --> 01:41:38.600
I might not have been born

01:41:38.600 --> 01:41:40.600
when that happened.

01:41:40.600 --> 01:41:42.600
And I wasn't born yesterday.

01:41:42.600 --> 01:41:44.600
But when that happened, we all were.

01:41:44.600 --> 01:41:46.600
And you know what you did.

01:41:46.600 --> 01:41:48.600
And it all comes down, Tom.

01:41:48.600 --> 01:41:50.600
It's not whether or not you love me

01:41:50.600 --> 01:41:52.600
or don't love me.

01:41:52.600 --> 01:41:54.600
It's whether or not when I look in your eyes

01:41:54.600 --> 01:41:56.600
I can feel, I can feel

01:41:56.600 --> 01:41:58.600
what I used to feel.

01:42:00.600 --> 01:42:02.600
I walk and I put my hand

01:42:02.600 --> 01:42:04.600
on a pane of glass

01:42:04.600 --> 01:42:06.600
and there's raindrops on the other side.

01:42:06.600 --> 01:42:08.600
And on the other side

01:42:08.600 --> 01:42:10.600
of that window pane,

01:42:10.600 --> 01:42:12.600
you can still see Billy Zane in the market.

01:42:12.600 --> 01:42:14.600
That's a hellscape out there.

01:42:14.600 --> 01:42:16.600
It's a fiery hellscape.

01:42:20.600 --> 01:42:22.600
And they thump the wall

01:42:22.600 --> 01:42:24.600
and a record needle goes down.

01:42:36.600 --> 01:42:38.600
Well, Nicole,

01:42:38.600 --> 01:42:42.600
I'm gonna have to get my lawyer involved.

01:42:42.600 --> 01:42:44.600
Tom, no.

01:42:44.600 --> 01:42:46.600
Oh, yes, Nicole.

01:42:46.600 --> 01:42:48.600
Yes, it's past the point now.

01:42:48.600 --> 01:42:50.600
I've introduced the character, Nicole,

01:42:50.600 --> 01:42:52.600
my lawyer.

01:42:52.600 --> 01:42:54.600
Oh.

01:43:00.600 --> 01:43:02.600
I'm the lawyer.

01:43:02.600 --> 01:43:04.600
Hi.

01:43:04.600 --> 01:43:06.600
How are you?

01:43:06.600 --> 01:43:08.600
I, uh...

01:43:08.600 --> 01:43:10.600
I was in your purse.

01:43:12.600 --> 01:43:14.600
All right, well,

01:43:14.600 --> 01:43:16.600
let's get this over with.

01:43:16.600 --> 01:43:18.600
Wait a minute.

01:43:18.600 --> 01:43:20.600
I'm with Tom, right?

01:43:20.600 --> 01:43:22.600
Yeah, I am, Tom.

01:43:22.600 --> 01:43:24.600
Yeah, I was in your purse.

01:43:24.600 --> 01:43:26.600
And now I'm just poking my nose

01:43:26.600 --> 01:43:28.600
and my fingers out.

01:43:28.600 --> 01:43:30.600
I'm like, I'm the lawyer.

01:43:30.600 --> 01:43:32.600
This is a powerful visual, Nicole.

01:43:32.600 --> 01:43:34.600
Think how it'll play in court.

01:43:34.600 --> 01:43:36.600
Hello.

01:43:38.600 --> 01:43:40.600
Fine, I love you. I love you.

01:43:40.600 --> 01:43:42.600
Let's do it. Good. Nice.

01:43:42.600 --> 01:43:44.600
Let's stay married.

01:43:44.600 --> 01:43:46.600
Let's not just stay married. Let's fuck.

01:43:46.600 --> 01:43:48.600
Let's fuck right here, Nicole.

01:43:48.600 --> 01:43:50.600
Yes.

01:43:50.600 --> 01:43:52.600
Yes.

01:43:52.600 --> 01:43:54.600
Yes. I'm Tom Cruise.

01:43:54.600 --> 01:43:56.600
I'm Nicole Kidman.

01:43:58.600 --> 01:44:00.600
Can we still leave?

01:44:00.600 --> 01:44:02.600
Are we allowed?

01:44:02.600 --> 01:44:04.600
I need you to watch.

01:44:04.600 --> 01:44:06.600
If it's worth doing to me, it's worth you watching.

01:44:06.600 --> 01:44:08.600
I'm trying to run a ceramics business here.

01:44:08.600 --> 01:44:10.600
I don't feel safe with him.

01:44:12.600 --> 01:44:14.600
See the...

01:44:14.600 --> 01:44:16.600
You're done now.

01:44:16.600 --> 01:44:18.600
Thank you, Tom.

01:44:18.600 --> 01:44:20.600
So there's closure?

01:44:20.600 --> 01:44:22.600
Yeah.

01:44:22.600 --> 01:44:24.600
We're almost done with the show

01:44:24.600 --> 01:44:26.600
if you left it this way.

01:44:26.600 --> 01:44:28.600
Oh, really? Let's stick it out.

01:44:28.600 --> 01:44:30.600
Yeah.

01:44:30.600 --> 01:44:32.600
I came back to the devil's office with...

01:44:32.600 --> 01:44:34.600
Stephanie, was it?

01:44:34.600 --> 01:44:35.600
What was my name?

01:44:35.600 --> 01:44:36.600
Stephanie, yeah.

01:44:36.600 --> 01:44:38.600
Devil.

01:44:38.600 --> 01:44:40.600
The office has gone to shit since Penn had left.

01:44:40.600 --> 01:44:42.600
I'm doing everything. I'm at sixes and sevens over here.

01:44:42.600 --> 01:44:44.600
But I've been looking around.

01:44:44.600 --> 01:44:46.600
Everybody's having a good time.

01:44:46.600 --> 01:44:48.600
Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman got back together.

01:44:48.600 --> 01:44:50.600
Kind of.

01:44:50.600 --> 01:44:52.600
Their contra-tomp is kind of over.

01:44:52.600 --> 01:44:54.600
Margaret Thatcher's having a time of her life.

01:44:54.600 --> 01:44:56.600
Yeah, so why don't I just put on a...

01:44:56.600 --> 01:44:58.600
What are we doing here?

01:44:58.600 --> 01:45:00.600
Exactly. Why don't we...

01:45:00.600 --> 01:45:02.600
Why aren't we just in heaven?

01:45:02.600 --> 01:45:04.600
You know the bartender down the road?

01:45:04.600 --> 01:45:06.600
He's making a fortune in ceramics.

01:45:06.600 --> 01:45:08.600
All right, I'm the one holding up the show.

01:45:08.600 --> 01:45:10.600
We're barely breaking even here.

01:45:10.600 --> 01:45:12.600
Stephanie.

01:45:12.600 --> 01:45:14.600
Get me God.

01:45:14.600 --> 01:45:16.600
It's time.

01:45:16.600 --> 01:45:30.600
Hello?

01:45:30.600 --> 01:45:36.600
Hiya.

01:45:36.600 --> 01:45:38.600
Hi, God. It's Steph.

01:45:38.600 --> 01:45:40.600
I got the D-Bone on the phone for you.

01:45:40.600 --> 01:45:42.600
Can I put you on?

01:45:42.600 --> 01:45:44.600
Yeah, go for it.

01:45:44.600 --> 01:45:46.600
Devil like I got...

01:45:46.600 --> 01:45:50.600
Hey!

01:45:50.600 --> 01:45:52.600
Hey, how's it going?

01:45:52.600 --> 01:45:54.600
You know.

01:45:54.600 --> 01:45:56.600
I mean, you know.

01:45:56.600 --> 01:45:58.600
Yeah, you don't call too much,

01:45:58.600 --> 01:46:00.600
but it's an uncommon.

01:46:00.600 --> 01:46:02.600
Yeah, yeah.

01:46:02.600 --> 01:46:04.600
Glad to hear from you.

01:46:04.600 --> 01:46:06.600
It's good to hear you, too.

01:46:06.600 --> 01:46:10.600
It's crazy.

01:46:10.600 --> 01:46:12.600
It's like, I don't even know what's punishment,

01:46:12.600 --> 01:46:14.600
what's reward.

01:46:14.600 --> 01:46:16.600
Yeah, when you're outside of my glory,

01:46:16.600 --> 01:46:18.600
things get all mixed up.

01:46:26.600 --> 01:46:28.600
But you know all about that.

01:46:28.600 --> 01:46:30.600
But it's got to be crazy up there, too, man.

01:46:30.600 --> 01:46:32.600
No, I mean, it's heaven.

01:46:36.600 --> 01:46:38.600
Paradise, my friend.

01:46:38.600 --> 01:46:40.600
So, uh...

01:46:40.600 --> 01:46:42.600
Yeah, I just...

01:46:42.600 --> 01:46:44.600
I miss you, I miss you!

01:46:44.600 --> 01:46:46.600
I miss you!

01:46:46.600 --> 01:46:48.600
Yeah.

01:46:48.600 --> 01:46:50.600
No, I know, I know.

01:46:54.600 --> 01:46:56.600
All right, well,

01:46:56.600 --> 01:46:58.600
we should get together sometime.

01:46:58.600 --> 01:47:00.600
Yeah, no, I'm planning on that

01:47:00.600 --> 01:47:02.600
a couple thousand years.

01:47:02.600 --> 01:47:04.600
Don't flatter yourself, you fucking...

01:47:04.600 --> 01:47:06.600
Oh, no, devil, devil.

01:47:06.600 --> 01:47:08.600
Call him back, call him back.

01:47:08.600 --> 01:47:10.600
No, I'm calling him back.

01:47:10.600 --> 01:47:12.600
No, no, no!

01:47:12.600 --> 01:47:14.600
I will turn you into a fucking mouse!

01:47:14.600 --> 01:47:16.600
Our lawyers agree that you're not allowed to do that.

01:47:16.600 --> 01:47:18.600
You're a mouse!

01:47:18.600 --> 01:47:20.600
Squeak, squeak!

01:47:20.600 --> 01:47:22.600
Everyone that defies me is a fucking mouse!

01:47:24.600 --> 01:47:26.600
I don't want to fucking...

01:47:26.600 --> 01:47:28.600
Why does he do that?

01:47:28.600 --> 01:47:30.600
It's so fucked up to say to somebody!

01:47:30.600 --> 01:47:32.600
Oh, my God, it's so fucked up!

01:47:32.600 --> 01:47:37.600
Jumping out the devil window!

01:47:37.600 --> 01:47:45.100
P classic.

01:47:45.100 --> 01:47:48.360
Vanilla skull.

01:47:48.360 --> 01:47:56.120
Very big seam.

01:47:56.120 --> 01:48:01.540
Hunter, he just blinks.

01:48:01.540 --> 01:48:10.900
He just blinks. Honey, he just blinks. Honey, he just blinks. Honey, are you okay? Are you

01:48:10.900 --> 01:48:17.100
with us, honey? It's your mother and father, Mrs. Mr. and Mrs. Devil.

01:48:17.100 --> 01:48:20.220
Oh, dad.

01:48:20.220 --> 01:48:24.660
You had such a bad fall, big guy.

01:48:24.660 --> 01:48:33.900
Your mom, dad. Yeah. I got kicked out of heaven. Yeah, I don't know.

01:48:33.900 --> 01:48:44.780
You did it a second time. It's like it's self-destructive. You want to be unhappy, son.

01:48:44.780 --> 01:48:51.500
It's like you want to be unhappy. I don't know. That doesn't help.

01:48:51.500 --> 01:48:57.460
I'm just saying, you keep getting fired from your own jobs.

01:48:57.460 --> 01:49:05.020
Like you're in charge of hell. Now it's being run by this weird ceramics corporation.

01:49:05.020 --> 01:49:11.180
Shit's going, it's really horrifying.

01:49:11.180 --> 01:49:21.460
And the devil's dick moves upward like Pinocchio's nose through the ceiling of the hospital.

01:49:21.460 --> 01:49:29.380
Into the sky, where it blooms into a red tree with green leaves.

01:49:29.380 --> 01:49:36.940
And within those green leaves, caterpillars feed.

01:49:36.940 --> 01:49:39.060
I'll get it, says the little caterpillar.

01:49:39.060 --> 01:49:45.820
Hello, it's Margaret Thatcher again. Where's the toilet?

01:49:45.820 --> 01:49:47.020
It's over there.

01:49:47.020 --> 01:49:53.700
It's over there. Back there? I'll be back.

01:49:53.700 --> 01:49:58.660
It's the actual, yeah.

01:49:58.660 --> 01:50:00.860
Really had to pee in real life. That was a real life pee.

01:50:00.860 --> 01:50:03.220
Oh, he had to go back. Oh, he had to really go.

01:50:03.220 --> 01:50:08.500
I think he really had to pee. We've been up here a long time.

01:50:08.500 --> 01:50:15.460
I just realized, he was gesturing and he was pointing and I was like, I thought he

01:50:15.460 --> 01:50:21.980
meant, like, like, like, should I leave? And I was like, no, baby, stay.

01:50:21.980 --> 01:50:25.780
Like I was doing up a big favor, like, no, come on, we're all people here.

01:50:25.780 --> 01:50:28.340
And he's like, I'm pissing my pants.

01:50:28.340 --> 01:50:30.260
You know what he's doing? You know what he's doing right now?

01:50:30.260 --> 01:50:31.980
It's making chocolate poopies.

01:50:31.980 --> 01:50:32.980
It's great.

01:50:32.980 --> 01:50:33.980
All right.

01:50:33.980 --> 01:50:34.980
All right.

01:50:34.980 --> 01:50:37.740
Where was it going with the caterpillars?

01:50:37.740 --> 01:50:40.940
I don't know. Do we need to talk about the loud laughing guy again?

01:50:40.940 --> 01:50:45.140
Like the, because we talked about everything else, you know, the guy who's like, where's

01:50:45.140 --> 01:50:46.140
the guy?

01:50:46.140 --> 01:50:47.140
He's right there.

01:50:47.140 --> 01:50:48.140
There he is.

01:50:48.140 --> 01:50:49.140
Let him have a good time.

01:50:49.140 --> 01:50:50.140
He's having a great time.

01:50:50.140 --> 01:50:51.140
All right.

01:50:51.140 --> 01:50:52.140
Let him have a good time.

01:50:52.140 --> 01:50:53.140
He's fine in here. People, people are still, they're going.

01:50:53.140 --> 01:50:54.140
You got a loud laugh.

01:50:54.140 --> 01:50:57.140
They're listening to the podcast and they're going like, that guy's laugh is amazing.

01:50:57.140 --> 01:51:07.140
I don't know what to do.

01:51:07.140 --> 01:51:10.220
I want to have a button to just push where that happens at all times.

01:51:10.220 --> 01:51:17.220
You do, it's called this show and talking, right? I mean, he's having, he likes it all.

01:51:17.220 --> 01:51:20.220
He likes, he likes it all.

01:51:20.220 --> 01:51:31.220
I don't know what to do.

01:51:31.220 --> 01:51:35.220
I'm making a log and somebody's laugh.

01:51:35.220 --> 01:51:38.220
But it's just, I think it's the way it hits the microphones.

01:51:38.220 --> 01:51:40.220
It's the Redditors, you know, they're joyless.

01:51:40.220 --> 01:51:43.220
They don't hear a lot of laughter.

01:51:43.220 --> 01:51:48.220
So they're like, they're like, oh my God, that's already grading just the sound of joy in

01:51:48.220 --> 01:51:49.220
general.

01:51:49.220 --> 01:51:54.220
And then that guy's like, holy shit, bulldozer of joy.

01:51:54.220 --> 01:51:57.220
I have a thing going on here.

01:51:57.220 --> 01:52:01.220
I mean, on the other side of the spectrum, we have, one guy just supplements all of his

01:52:01.220 --> 01:52:06.220
joy to, yup.

01:52:06.220 --> 01:52:09.220
I think, I think, I think, I think, I think we've learned to listen tonight.

01:52:09.220 --> 01:52:11.220
Oh, we learned a lot.

01:52:11.220 --> 01:52:15.220
I probably, I probably sum it up and something that you can applaud too.

01:52:15.220 --> 01:52:17.220
Like a, like a, yeah.

01:52:17.220 --> 01:52:18.220
Yeah.

01:52:18.220 --> 01:52:19.220
Yeah.

01:52:19.220 --> 01:52:20.220
Yeah.

01:52:20.220 --> 01:52:21.220
Yeah.

01:52:21.220 --> 01:52:22.220
Yeah.

01:52:22.220 --> 01:52:23.220
Yeah.

01:52:23.220 --> 01:52:24.220
Yeah.

01:52:24.220 --> 01:52:25.220
Just let me feel.

01:52:25.220 --> 01:52:26.220
Yeah.

01:52:26.220 --> 01:52:28.220
Can I change my mind on that selection?

01:52:28.220 --> 01:52:29.220
Yeah.

01:52:29.220 --> 01:52:30.220
Sorry.

01:52:30.220 --> 01:52:31.220
Yeah.

01:52:31.220 --> 01:52:32.220
Yeah.

01:52:32.220 --> 01:52:33.220
Yeah.

01:52:33.220 --> 01:52:34.220
Yeah.

01:52:34.220 --> 01:52:35.220
Just let me feel.

01:52:35.220 --> 01:52:36.220
Yeah.

01:52:36.220 --> 01:52:37.220
Yeah.

01:52:37.220 --> 01:52:38.220
Yeah.

01:52:38.220 --> 01:52:39.220
Sure.

01:52:39.220 --> 01:52:40.220
Okay.

01:52:40.220 --> 01:52:41.220
Oh shit.

01:52:41.220 --> 01:52:43.220
Margaret Thatcher's back.

01:52:43.220 --> 01:52:44.220
Oh yeah.

01:52:44.220 --> 01:52:45.220
Okay.

01:52:45.220 --> 01:52:46.220
Oh yeah.

01:52:46.220 --> 01:52:48.220
Margaret Thatcher, can you hype ma'am for him?

01:52:48.220 --> 01:52:49.220
Like flavor Flavestown?

01:52:49.220 --> 01:52:52.220
I like, I like the other one though.

01:52:52.220 --> 01:52:53.220
This one's intimidating me.

01:52:53.220 --> 01:52:55.220
This reminds me of the movie.

01:52:55.220 --> 01:52:56.220
Yeah.

01:52:56.220 --> 01:52:57.220
Yeah.

01:52:57.220 --> 01:52:58.220
Yeah.

01:52:58.220 --> 01:52:59.220
Yeah.

01:52:59.220 --> 01:53:00.220
Yeah.

01:53:00.220 --> 01:53:01.220
Yeah.

01:53:01.220 --> 01:53:02.220
Yeah.

01:53:02.220 --> 01:53:03.220
Yeah.

01:53:03.220 --> 01:53:04.220
Yeah.

01:53:04.220 --> 01:53:05.220
Yeah.

01:53:05.220 --> 01:53:06.220
Yeah.

01:53:06.220 --> 01:53:07.220
Yeah.

01:53:07.220 --> 01:53:10.220
Are you crazy for this one, Dan?

01:53:10.220 --> 01:53:11.220
Yeah.

01:53:11.220 --> 01:53:12.220
Can you believe it?

01:53:12.220 --> 01:53:14.220
You hear that?

01:53:14.220 --> 01:53:15.220
Yeah.

01:53:15.220 --> 01:53:16.220
Yeah.

01:53:16.220 --> 01:53:17.220
Yeah.

01:53:17.220 --> 01:53:18.220
Yeah.

01:53:18.220 --> 01:53:19.220
East Coast.

01:53:19.220 --> 01:53:23.220
No, it's just, stick around.

01:53:23.220 --> 01:53:24.220
He's just getting started.

01:53:24.220 --> 01:53:25.220
He's just getting started.

01:53:25.220 --> 01:53:26.220
East Coast.

01:53:26.220 --> 01:53:28.220
He's just getting started.

01:53:28.220 --> 01:53:33.220
East Coast is the only coast.

01:53:33.220 --> 01:53:35.220
It's an unpopular opinion,

01:53:35.220 --> 01:53:37.220
but only on the West Coast.

01:53:37.220 --> 01:53:40.220
The West Coast doesn't exist.

01:53:40.220 --> 01:53:42.220
It's an artificial construct

01:53:42.220 --> 01:53:46.220
written by a list of people.

01:53:46.220 --> 01:53:50.220
Call them Jews.

01:53:50.220 --> 01:53:54.220
I'm an East Coast anti-Semitic rapper.

01:53:54.220 --> 01:53:57.220
East Coast anti-Semitic rapper.

01:53:57.220 --> 01:54:00.220
I believe the West Coast is a figment

01:54:00.220 --> 01:54:04.220
created by the Zionists.

01:54:04.220 --> 01:54:08.220
An extreme East Coast anti-Semitic rapper.

01:54:08.220 --> 01:54:14.220
Don't get any more East Coast than this.

01:54:14.220 --> 01:54:20.220
It's just a concept I'm workshopping.

01:54:20.220 --> 01:54:23.220
I can't even hear the, what's the beat?

01:54:23.220 --> 01:54:25.220
It just sounds like, yo.

01:54:25.220 --> 01:54:26.220
You picked this one.

01:54:26.220 --> 01:54:27.220
Yo.

01:54:27.220 --> 01:54:28.220
Yo.

01:54:28.220 --> 01:54:29.220
Yo.

01:54:29.220 --> 01:54:30.220
Spaghetti.

01:54:30.220 --> 01:54:31.220
Linguini.

01:54:31.220 --> 01:54:32.220
Pasta.

01:54:32.220 --> 01:54:33.220
Sauce.

01:54:33.220 --> 01:54:35.220
I fucked your mama.

01:54:35.220 --> 01:54:37.220
Who's the boss?

01:54:37.220 --> 01:54:38.220
Give me a second.

01:54:38.220 --> 01:54:41.220
Don't, don't help.

01:54:41.220 --> 01:54:43.220
I mean, that's extreme, right?

01:54:43.220 --> 01:54:44.220
That's extreme.

01:54:44.220 --> 01:54:45.220
That's not fine.

01:54:45.220 --> 01:54:46.220
That's fine.

01:54:46.220 --> 01:54:47.220
Don't, don't, don't feel shame.

01:54:47.220 --> 01:54:50.220
Don't, but feel a little,

01:54:50.220 --> 01:54:51.220
say 10% shame.

01:54:51.220 --> 01:54:53.220
Just feel 10% shame, I think,

01:54:53.220 --> 01:54:55.220
than everyone will,

01:54:55.220 --> 01:55:00.220
will stop losing subscribers.

01:55:00.220 --> 01:55:01.220
Yup.

01:55:01.220 --> 01:55:03.220
Top down, bottom up.

01:55:03.220 --> 01:55:05.220
Fucked your mama so hard.

01:55:05.220 --> 01:55:07.220
She looked like a cup.

01:55:07.220 --> 01:55:11.220
The diameter of a vagina.

01:55:11.220 --> 01:55:14.220
Was as big as North Carolina.

01:55:14.220 --> 01:55:17.220
Put my dick in it so hard.

01:55:17.220 --> 01:55:21.220
Fucked your mama into the front and back yard.

01:55:21.220 --> 01:55:23.220
That song was over.

01:55:23.220 --> 01:55:24.220
Okay.

01:55:24.220 --> 01:55:25.220
No, we're doing it.

01:55:25.220 --> 01:55:26.220
We're doing it.

01:55:26.220 --> 01:55:27.220
I'm so, so close to it.

01:55:27.220 --> 01:55:28.220
We're ending with this.

01:55:28.220 --> 01:55:29.220
All right.

01:55:29.220 --> 01:55:30.220
Yeah.

01:55:30.220 --> 01:55:31.220
We can end at any moment.

01:55:31.220 --> 01:55:32.220
Any moment this is over.

01:55:32.220 --> 01:55:33.220
Shit.

01:55:33.220 --> 01:55:38.220
Nancy Reagan dance.

01:55:38.220 --> 01:55:42.220
Nancy Reagan dance, everybody.

01:55:42.220 --> 01:55:44.220
Doing the Reagan.

01:55:44.220 --> 01:55:46.220
He's doing the Nancy.

01:55:46.220 --> 01:55:47.220
Oh, yes.

01:55:47.220 --> 01:55:48.220
Hey, no.

01:55:48.220 --> 01:55:53.220
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.

01:55:53.220 --> 01:55:54.220
Yeah.

01:55:54.220 --> 01:55:55.220
Everybody do the Nancy.

01:55:55.220 --> 01:55:56.220
Mustard.

01:55:56.220 --> 01:55:57.220
Salt.

01:55:57.220 --> 01:55:58.220
Ketchup.

01:55:58.220 --> 01:55:59.220
Lettuce.

01:55:59.220 --> 01:56:00.220
Fuck your mama.

01:56:00.220 --> 01:56:01.220
She let us.

01:56:01.220 --> 01:56:02.220
Do it.

01:56:02.220 --> 01:56:03.220
That's confidence in.

01:56:03.220 --> 01:56:04.220
Put it to it.

01:56:04.220 --> 01:56:05.220
Stop.

01:56:05.220 --> 01:56:06.220
Stop.

01:56:06.220 --> 01:56:07.220
Take it.

01:56:07.220 --> 01:56:08.220
I'm coming down here for this show.

01:56:08.220 --> 01:56:09.220
Let's do it.

01:56:09.220 --> 01:56:10.220
Woo.

01:56:10.220 --> 01:56:12.220
Let's hear it for William Q.

01:56:12.220 --> 01:56:13.220
Uptown, downtown.

01:56:13.220 --> 01:56:14.220
Fuck your mama.

01:56:14.220 --> 01:56:15.220
Rob Schrab.

01:56:15.220 --> 01:56:19.220
It's a great ending.

01:56:19.220 --> 01:56:21.220
Side to side.

01:56:21.220 --> 01:56:28.220
I'm Jeff Davis.

01:56:28.220 --> 01:56:31.220
Thank you, Zach.

01:56:31.220 --> 01:56:32.220
Chris.

01:56:32.220 --> 01:56:33.220
Dustin.

01:56:33.220 --> 01:56:34.220
Everybody back there doing the thing.

01:56:34.220 --> 01:56:37.220
Drive fast and take chances.

01:56:37.220 --> 01:56:42.220
You're allowed to leave whenever you want.

01:56:42.220 --> 01:56:44.220
Fuck your mama for all her life.

01:56:44.220 --> 01:56:48.220
Got the vegetables, cereals, grains, the whole food pyramid.

01:56:48.220 --> 01:56:51.220
You're a nutrition.

01:56:51.220 --> 01:56:56.220
Fuck your mama so she can get tuition.

01:56:56.220 --> 01:56:59.220
That was badass.

01:56:59.220 --> 01:57:04.220
Even so, that was good.

01:57:04.220 --> 01:57:09.220
Fuck your mama for tuition.

01:57:09.220 --> 01:57:14.220
Okay, all right.

01:57:14.220 --> 01:57:20.220
And then we'll see you at South by Southwest, but there's still going to be a show here next week.

01:57:27.220 --> 01:57:28.220
Did you get any of that?

01:57:28.220 --> 01:57:38.220
It's a good show!
