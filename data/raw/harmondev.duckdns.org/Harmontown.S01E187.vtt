California\n\n00:07.800 --> 00:09.400\nIn the back real of Meltdown Comics\n\n00:09.400 --> 00:12.000\nHarmontown is now in session\n\n00:12.000 --> 00:15.000\nYeah, it's so great to die in such a small world\n\n00:15.000 --> 00:16.000\nOh yeah\n\n00:16.000 --> 00:19.000\nIt's so great to die in such a small world\n\n00:19.000 --> 00:22.000\nYeah, it's so great to die in such a small world\n\n00:22.000 --> 00:24.000\nLet's bring out somebody near and dear to my heart\n\n00:24.000 --> 00:32.000\nMr. Spencer Quentin\n\n00:32.000 --> 00:37.000\nOh yeah\n\n00:37.000 --> 00:46.000\nAnd the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harlan\n\n00:46.000 --> 00:49.000\nThank you very much, thank you\n\n00:49.000 --> 00:52.000\nThank you\n\n00:52.000 --> 00:56.000\nThank you\n\n00:56.000 --> 00:58.000\nYou seem very cocksier tonight\n\n00:58.000 --> 01:01.000\nI'm a little high\n\n01:01.000 --> 01:03.000\nI'll be honest with you\n\n01:03.000 --> 01:05.000\nWhat flavor of narcotics are you on tonight?\n\n01:05.000 --> 01:06.000\nJust weed or what?\n\n01:06.000 --> 01:08.000\nStrawberry cough, I think it's called?\n\n01:08.000 --> 01:10.000\nI don't know, sativa\n\n01:10.000 --> 01:13.000\nI'm not, I don't make that my gimmick\n\n01:13.000 --> 01:17.000\nIt's make that society's gimmick\n\n01:17.000 --> 01:19.000\nLegalize it!\n\n01:19.000 --> 01:22.000\nAlright, Nancy Reagan died\n\n01:25.000 --> 01:28.000\nMaybe that's why I got so high before the show\n\n01:28.000 --> 01:34.000\nI feel like a ghost finally stops telling me to say no to things\n\n01:34.000 --> 01:37.000\nMaybe I...\n\n01:37.000 --> 01:39.000\nDid you write that joke down, was that prepared?\n\n01:39.000 --> 01:41.000\nNo, I just made the connection, I came out\n\n01:41.000 --> 01:43.000\nI followed, I told them I'm high\n\n01:43.000 --> 01:45.000\nThey're gonna know sooner or later that I'm high\n\n01:45.000 --> 01:47.000\nAnd then I was like, I got one thing to talk\n\n01:47.000 --> 01:49.000\nNancy Reagan died\n\n01:49.000 --> 01:52.000\nYou just said yes\n\n01:52.000 --> 01:54.000\nBut then, yeah, okay\n\n01:54.000 --> 01:56.000\nIt's not like you've been saying no your whole life\n\n01:56.000 --> 01:59.000\nNo I haven't, but yet a floodgate did open more\n\n01:59.000 --> 02:02.000\nMaybe that's what happened\n\n02:02.000 --> 02:04.000\nAlright, so Nancy Reagan\n\n02:04.000 --> 02:07.000\n94 years old, rich\n\n02:07.000 --> 02:13.000\nSo, you're saying foul play\n\n02:13.000 --> 02:16.000\nThe curse of the first ladies\n\n02:16.000 --> 02:18.000\nThey all die\n\n02:18.000 --> 02:21.000\nAll of these women married first men\n\n02:21.000 --> 02:24.000\nAll of them are dropping away\n\n02:24.000 --> 02:25.000\nAnd they're 90s\n\n02:25.000 --> 02:26.000\nYear by year\n\n02:26.000 --> 02:28.000\nNorma Taft\n\n02:28.000 --> 02:31.000\nYou know, you want to be a great serial killer\n\n02:31.000 --> 02:33.000\nKill people who are 94\n\n02:39.000 --> 02:43.000\nThere was a, you know, famous people die\n\n02:43.000 --> 02:46.000\nThe reason for saying famous people, they die as often\n\n02:46.000 --> 02:52.000\nIf not more than the obscure\n\n02:52.000 --> 02:54.000\nThey die less\n\n02:54.000 --> 02:56.000\nThat's the point of being famous\n\n02:56.000 --> 02:57.000\nThey're rare\n\n02:57.000 --> 02:58.000\nThey die less?\n\n02:58.000 --> 02:59.000\nThey're rare people\n\n02:59.000 --> 03:01.000\nFamous people die less than non-famous people\n\n03:01.000 --> 03:04.000\nI thought it was closer to a one-to-one ratio\n\n03:07.000 --> 03:09.000\nIn a room full of 100 people\n\n03:09.000 --> 03:13.000\nLess of them that die will be famous\n\n03:13.000 --> 03:15.000\nWell, because they're less famous people\n\n03:15.000 --> 03:17.000\nExactly, that's the point I was trying to make\n\n03:17.000 --> 03:18.000\nOkay, I dig it, alright\n\n03:18.000 --> 03:21.000\nThere are less famous deaths than obscure deaths\n\n03:21.000 --> 03:23.000\nWe just know about the famous ones\n\n03:27.000 --> 03:30.000\nMan, you're blowing my mind right now\n\n03:30.000 --> 03:33.000\nI really did think that was an awesome mind-blowing quote\n\n03:33.000 --> 03:37.000\nI picture that as being like Yogi Berra or Mark Twain on a calendar\n\n03:37.000 --> 03:40.000\nLike, there are less famous deaths than obscure ones\n\n03:40.000 --> 03:42.000\nWe just know about the latter\n\n03:42.000 --> 03:44.000\nI can't get it back\n\n03:44.000 --> 03:46.000\nI thought I did something amazing\n\n03:46.000 --> 03:49.000\nI want you to smoke more strawberry coffee before every show\n\n03:49.000 --> 03:52.000\nNancy Reagan, charm, grace, and a passion for America\n\n03:52.000 --> 03:55.000\nA lot of the headlines were like, this elegant suave\n\n03:55.000 --> 03:59.000\nLike, I don't know, it's a little class and like, I don't know\n\n03:59.000 --> 04:02.000\nThere's praising her dress\n\n04:02.000 --> 04:05.000\nA lot of people say she wore a red dress\n\n04:05.000 --> 04:07.000\nShe wore that red dress all the time\n\n04:07.000 --> 04:11.000\nAnd then it's hard, it's like, well, okay, she's...\n\n04:11.000 --> 04:15.000\nThere's the kind of USA Today article\n\n04:15.000 --> 04:17.000\nEverybody kind of chimes in\n\n04:17.000 --> 04:21.000\nAnd you have people like, for instance, let's see\n\n04:21.000 --> 04:25.000\nLike Obama, he's got, of course, he's got to say something\n\n04:25.000 --> 04:29.000\nHe said, our former First Lady redefined the role in her time here\n\n04:29.000 --> 04:31.000\nPresident Obama said in the statement\n\n04:31.000 --> 04:34.000\nLater, in her long goodbye with President Reagan\n\n04:34.000 --> 04:37.000\nShe became a voice on behalf of millions of families, blah, blah, blah\n\n04:37.000 --> 04:40.000\nPeople are like, what did she contribute?\n\n04:40.000 --> 04:43.000\nLet's eulogize her, blah, blah, blah\n\n04:43.000 --> 04:47.000\nSteve's scrolling down, Mitt Romney said...\n\n04:47.000 --> 04:50.000\nWell, he kind of...\n\n04:50.000 --> 04:52.000\nHe said something kind of dickish too\n\n04:52.000 --> 04:55.000\nThat'll undercut my punchline, which is Trump\n\n04:55.000 --> 04:58.000\nBut it's like everybody from Republicans to Democrats\n\n04:58.000 --> 05:01.000\nAnd everyone in between, people that lost their election\n\n05:01.000 --> 05:05.000\nLike Jimmy Carter had to say something, and he said\n\n05:05.000 --> 05:07.000\nMrs. Reagan's Just Say No program\n\n05:07.000 --> 05:11.000\nPrevented many young people from falling prey to the allure of drug use\n\n05:11.000 --> 05:13.000\nLike, he's...\n\n05:13.000 --> 05:15.000\nShe started a phony war on drugs\n\n05:15.000 --> 05:18.000\nThat's put a bunch of people in prison for no goddamn reason\n\n05:18.000 --> 05:26.000\nBut just confine this to the box of how to do a eulogy\n\n05:26.000 --> 05:29.000\nJust for a second, and then we'll get to all that stuff\n\n05:29.000 --> 05:31.000\nAnd that was mine\n\n05:31.000 --> 05:34.000\nSo it's just paragraph after paragraph after paragraph\n\n05:34.000 --> 05:36.000\nIt's like, Jim Henson said this, Jimmy Carter said that\n\n05:36.000 --> 05:38.000\nAnd it's just like, oh, what's he going to say?\n\n05:38.000 --> 05:42.000\nShe was like a muppet of people\n\n05:42.000 --> 05:45.000\nBut it says like...\n\n05:45.000 --> 05:48.000\nPeople largely get to like, Obama had a really nice story\n\n05:48.000 --> 05:51.000\nI think I read the wrong paragraph where he really kind of nailed it the most\n\n05:51.000 --> 05:53.000\nBecause he really did, he was like...\n\n05:53.000 --> 05:55.000\nIt's hard to move into the White House\n\n05:55.000 --> 06:00.000\nShe gave Michelle Obama kind of like a tutorial in it\n\n06:00.000 --> 06:02.000\nShe was like, you know...\n\n06:02.000 --> 06:04.000\nFocusing on her\n\n06:04.000 --> 06:11.000\nDonald Trump called Mrs. Reagan the wife of a truly great president\n\n06:11.000 --> 06:13.000\nThat's it, that's the end of my story\n\n06:13.000 --> 06:17.000\nPeople say he's a misogynist\n\n06:17.000 --> 06:21.000\nBut listen to that, listen to how much he loves women in that quote\n\n06:21.000 --> 06:25.000\nWhat are you saying?\n\n06:25.000 --> 06:27.000\nWhat a fucking cunt\n\n06:27.000 --> 06:32.000\nHe can't do anything I like\n\n06:32.000 --> 06:35.000\nIt's kind of magical, because he's that...\n\n06:35.000 --> 06:39.000\nEvery time he says something you're like, I fucking want to just hit you in the face\n\n06:39.000 --> 06:44.000\nThe wife of a truly great president and an amazing, amazing woman\n\n06:44.000 --> 06:48.000\nShe's really, really, really great, no it's true, it's true\n\n06:48.000 --> 06:50.000\nNo it's true, it's true\n\n06:50.000 --> 06:54.000\nWell, Ted Cruz said she will be remembered for her deep passion for this nation\n\n06:54.000 --> 06:56.000\nAnd love for her husband\n\n06:56.000 --> 07:00.000\nI mean, of course, she'll be remembered for her love for her husband\n\n07:00.000 --> 07:02.000\nThat's because her husband will be remembered\n\n07:02.000 --> 07:07.000\nShe did take care of a deeply senile, demented old dude for a long time\n\n07:07.000 --> 07:08.000\nAnd she was really cool about that\n\n07:08.000 --> 07:12.000\nIt was really weird to dance C and then I turned the TV on for a moment today\n\n07:12.000 --> 07:17.000\nAnd Anderson Cooper was talking to his mom, Gloria fucking Vanderbilt\n\n07:17.000 --> 07:19.000\nThat's fucking weird too\n\n07:19.000 --> 07:21.000\nHis mom's Gloria Vanderbilt, if I'm not mistaken\n\n07:21.000 --> 07:25.000\nAnd so they interviewed her, because she and Nancy were apparently boozing buddies\n\n07:25.000 --> 07:27.000\nThey were really good friends\n\n07:27.000 --> 07:31.000\nAnd so he's talking to Gloria Vanderbilt on the phone\n\n07:31.000 --> 07:34.000\nAnd Anderson Cooper, news anchor\n\n07:34.000 --> 07:37.000\nOkay mom, so, and he kept calling her mom\n\n07:37.000 --> 07:40.000\nI was like, this is the worst news show in the world\n\n07:40.000 --> 07:43.000\nTalking to your mom\n\n07:43.000 --> 07:45.000\nThat sounds adorable\n\n07:45.000 --> 07:49.000\nI mean, she actually eulogized Nancy quite well because they were pals\n\n07:49.000 --> 07:53.000\nBut here's the thing, like so Nancy Reagan, you think, well, you guys don't think\n\n07:53.000 --> 07:56.000\nSome of you think, I don't know, like Norma Taft\n\n07:56.000 --> 07:59.000\nBut I was a child of the 80s\n\n07:59.000 --> 08:01.000\nNancy Reagan sat on Mr. T's lap\n\n08:01.000 --> 08:03.000\nNancy Reagan was the just say no lady\n\n08:03.000 --> 08:06.000\nNancy Reagan was on, why can't I speak, because I'm high\n\n08:06.000 --> 08:09.000\nNancy Reagan was on different strokes\n\n08:09.000 --> 08:13.000\nAnd she had a little gimmick and she was like, she was Nancy Reagan\n\n08:13.000 --> 08:15.000\nBut...\n\n08:15.000 --> 08:17.000\nDid she do a little dance?\n\n08:17.000 --> 08:19.000\nShe would, you know, she would\n\n08:19.000 --> 08:23.000\nJust like they would trot her out and she would be like, I'm here with Knight Rider\n\n08:23.000 --> 08:26.000\nKnight Rider can say words that cars can't\n\n08:26.000 --> 08:30.000\nI eat all of them, but there's only one word your car needs to know\n\n08:30.000 --> 08:32.000\nAnd that's no\n\n08:32.000 --> 08:34.000\nTo drugs\n\n08:34.000 --> 08:40.000\nBecause my administration marks the beginning of a concept where you take, like for instance, crack cocaine\n\n08:40.000 --> 08:45.000\nAnd you say you get ten years in jail for the weight of crack cocaine\n\n08:45.000 --> 08:48.000\nThat you would get, like, a thousand years\n\n08:48.000 --> 08:53.000\nAnyways, it was, there was a lot of shit that you see people tweeting\n\n08:53.000 --> 08:55.000\nAnd you go, like, why are you legitimizing this person?\n\n08:55.000 --> 08:57.000\nI count myself among that\n\n08:57.000 --> 09:00.000\nIt's like, come on, Don Knotts dies\n\n09:00.000 --> 09:03.000\nAnd you go, look, a lot of people are dying, Don Knotts died\n\n09:03.000 --> 09:07.000\nAnd he was in the show, goodbye Don Knotts\n\n09:07.000 --> 09:13.000\nIf a president dies, then you go, like, ah, well, I remember that time in my life\n\n09:13.000 --> 09:16.000\nHe was president of it, okay\n\n09:16.000 --> 09:19.000\nNet, net, net, net zero, like, probably\n\n09:19.000 --> 09:23.000\nPositive memories and negative, whatever, didn't know\n\n09:23.000 --> 09:28.000\nThe wife of a president, I'm like, I don't know, I don't know how to deify anybody\n\n09:28.000 --> 09:34.000\nBecause if you're deifying her, you're deifying her for breakfast in America or whatever that era was called\n\n09:34.000 --> 09:38.000\nIt's a dawning of a new age where we're going to take all the mentally ill people and throw them in the street\n\n09:38.000 --> 09:40.000\nAnd just call them homeless from now on\n\n09:40.000 --> 09:43.000\nLike, like, like, that's not her\n\n09:43.000 --> 09:46.000\nShe wasn't, like, banging a gavel and saying, we should do that\n\n09:46.000 --> 09:49.000\nShe wasn't necessarily, like, here's the thing\n\n09:49.000 --> 09:53.000\nBig, big, big, big mistake we made during that era\n\n09:53.000 --> 09:56.000\nThe biggest complaint that, I mean, is the gay community\n\n09:56.000 --> 10:03.000\nBecause they literally, not only were they not responsive to what they knew was an epidemic\n\n10:03.000 --> 10:07.000\nThat they, actually, there's paper trails of them, like, going\n\n10:07.000 --> 10:12.000\nLet's actually, come on, we don't need that much funding for, like, like, that area and stuff\n\n10:12.000 --> 10:13.000\nThat's scandalous\n\n10:13.000 --> 10:18.000\nAnd then I said, there was a, oh, yeah, yeah, it was scandalous because it was a gay disease\n\n10:18.000 --> 10:23.000\nAnd then there's a story I read today and, oh, she just died\n\n10:23.000 --> 10:27.000\nSo I'm, like, standing over a grave and going, now let's talk about what a shitty time that was\n\n10:27.000 --> 10:28.000\nI'm not talking about her\n\n10:28.000 --> 10:29.000\nYou know what I mean?\n\n10:29.000 --> 10:31.000\nShe's probably an amazing person\n\n10:31.000 --> 10:35.000\nIf I were Nancy Reagan and my legacy, we're all going to remember her for having a red dress\n\n10:35.000 --> 10:38.000\nBeing a first lady in that order\n\n10:38.000 --> 10:40.000\nAnd say no to drugs\n\n10:40.000 --> 10:41.000\nJust say no\n\n10:41.000 --> 10:43.000\nWhat if she fucking just OD'd?\n\n10:43.000 --> 10:47.000\nIf I were Nancy, I would just say, I'm just going to speedball it\n\n10:47.000 --> 10:52.000\nI want you to find me with Dave Navarro in a bathroom floor\n\n10:52.000 --> 10:56.000\nOr if she just sat on her deathbed, if she just said, like, listen\n\n10:56.000 --> 10:58.000\nJust say yes\n\n10:58.000 --> 11:00.000\nTo all of it\n\n11:00.000 --> 11:02.000\nYeah\n\n11:02.000 --> 11:04.000\nYeah, there was a story I read in this\n\n11:04.000 --> 11:09.000\nLike, it brought all kinds of memories back to me\n\n11:09.000 --> 11:11.000\nBecause it was a story about how\n\n11:11.000 --> 11:17.000\nIt's a bit, like, it's a bit, I mean, it's inflammatory\n\n11:17.000 --> 11:18.000\nLike, maybe you don't even need it\n\n11:18.000 --> 11:20.000\nYour hair looks amazing tonight\n\n11:20.000 --> 11:21.000\nDo you blow dry

I just ate my shoe, but\n\n13:19.640 --> 13:30.760\nThat's a terrible way to die. Yeah, I just now found out you can eat a shoe\n\n13:31.400 --> 13:36.520\nPeople when back in the old days of leather shoes when you got hungry enough you boiled your boot and you ate it\n\n13:37.640 --> 13:39.640\nVerna Herzog ate a boot he\n\n13:39.840 --> 13:43.080\nVerna Herzog did a bet with Robert Semeckis. Who was it?\n\n13:44.040 --> 13:46.040\nErrol Morris\n\n13:46.040 --> 13:52.800\nIf it was Robert Semeckis and you wouldn't you wouldn't be able to trust the results like I feel like I bet I bet\n\n13:52.800 --> 13:54.280\nThat's not a real boot\n\n13:54.280 --> 13:56.280\nHe did a he did a bet about\n\n13:57.160 --> 14:01.840\nThey had some gentlemen's bet about the documentary world.

Perfect\n\n14:07.480 --> 14:11.080\nSo finish a film by certain deadline and go on Herzog\n\n14:11.080 --> 14:16.440\nThe bet was that he would eat a shoe and did Errol Morris shoot Herzog eating a shoe. Yeah\n\n14:17.160 --> 14:18.880\nShould look it up\n\n14:18.880 --> 14:20.880\nWhat's up? Oh\n\n14:21.600 --> 14:24.480\nHe frightened duck fat. Oh fancy.

It was like a like a Reebok or what?\n\n14:33.440 --> 14:37.640\nHeadline Nancy Reagan refused to help dying Rock Hudson get age treatment\n\n14:37.640 --> 14:45.640\nIs that true? It's it's it's it's it's a story that is like I was reading it\n\n14:45.640 --> 14:50.000\nIt was like bringing back all these memories because the interesting thing is it's a story about I don't know if this\n\n14:50.040 --> 14:56.720\nThis should be on her hands or not, but how rock Hudson back in those days\n\n14:57.200 --> 14:59.200\nHe they're in France. They had\n\n14:59.880 --> 15:06.520\nTreatments that were far more advanced than ours along the road of like acknowledging age and how to treat it rock Hudson\n\n15:06.520 --> 15:09.360\nWas like in line to get that treatment\n\n15:09.360 --> 15:12.880\nBut he was blocked at an international level because this was a French hospital\n\n15:12.880 --> 15:17.800\nAnd there was red tape tying it up and there was a point where somebody had called the White House and said\n\n15:17.800 --> 15:21.120\nThis is a friend of Nancy's from the acting day a friend of not Ronald's\n\n15:22.200 --> 15:26.800\nHe if a call from the White House might be able to get him through to this French hospital and\n\n15:27.520 --> 15:31.880\nThe there was a so they're you know, they're this incident is like sort of\n\n15:31.880 --> 15:39.400\nPulled apart and you're talking to each person on the chain. They're the person that answered that call and went to Nancy\n\n15:39.400 --> 15:47.040\nReagan and said this is the situation with rock Hudson. He acknowledges. He's he's on the side of like this is not about AIDS being a\n\n15:48.280 --> 15:51.640\nStigmatized or anything like that that it was about objectivity\n\n15:52.280 --> 15:54.920\nEgalitarianism, oh god if we did a favor for our Hollywood friend\n\n15:54.920 --> 16:00.380\nCan you imagine lots of other people of course making the very valid observation that give me a break if Bob\n\n16:00.380 --> 16:03.200\nHope had colon cancer if you wouldn't fucking bomb to that\n\n16:08.200 --> 16:10.200\nJust just to get your frustrations out\n\n16:12.200 --> 16:14.200\nWasn't it wasn't it rock Hudson's\n\n16:14.720 --> 16:20.320\nDeath from AIDS what softened the Reagan stance on it like it wasn't that the first time they kind of acknowledged\n\n16:20.320 --> 16:24.400\nWell, this is the thing is that that's what got me really thinking about this because part of this article is it's not\n\n16:24.400 --> 16:27.840\nIt's not all just like sort of slinging and you know TM zing about like\n\n16:27.840 --> 16:31.680\nOh, and Nancy Reagan like didn't like it goes into\n\n16:32.400 --> 16:36.080\nYou know conjures these memories like you get a lot of you guys like you know\n\n16:36.080 --> 16:40.040\nit's like like I was on the playground and rock Hudson died of AIDS and\n\n16:41.400 --> 16:47.200\nLike the two things that happened were just a huge avalanche of horrible horrible jokes\n\n16:47.440 --> 16:51.880\nJust like that's how I most remember it in my brain is like the 10,000 awful\n\n16:51.880 --> 16:57.960\nEven by then standards let alone today's like horrible horrible jokes about this guy rock Hudson\n\n16:57.960 --> 17:00.120\nThat none of us had ever heard of because we were kids in a playground\n\n17:00.120 --> 17:03.920\nBut it's just like rock Hudson this rock Hudson that knock knock was there rock Hudson's game\n\n17:03.920 --> 17:05.920\nIt's an underwear and suddenly it's just like everything\n\n17:06.760 --> 17:11.240\nReally there was just gay jokes because no one understood what AIDS was and what it meant\n\n17:11.240 --> 17:13.480\nI remember a bunch and I won't repeat them because they're terrible\n\n17:13.480 --> 17:18.040\nSo it was like that that it's like it's it's it's a sad wistful kind of\n\n17:18.040 --> 17:26.320\nStory because you remember like this guy like it's it's like you kind of wish that he could have known because obviously he went out fighting and\n\n17:27.400 --> 17:29.320\nscared and\n\n17:29.320 --> 17:35.700\nProbably ashamed probably deeply ashamed and like to think you know, he's like he's sort of the Randy Quaid in the\n\n17:36.680 --> 17:45.400\nIndependence Day like yeah, he's like I'm like he's he's his because everyone acknowledges historically and in fact academically that like\n\n17:45.400 --> 17:48.840\nRock Hudson showing up on the radar at that time\n\n17:49.280 --> 17:54.000\nWe managed to nudge the meteor that could have destroyed so much more\n\n17:54.000 --> 17:59.160\nYeah, you know a little bit out of its trajectory at that people had to start talking about it\n\n17:59.160 --> 18:06.000\nThere was no choice left anymore. And so all that leads to dollars and cents going and you know, whatever\n\n18:06.600 --> 18:08.160\nSo it was it was a weird day\n\n18:08.160 --> 18:12.800\nI think for a lot of people because Ronald Reagan's long dead and it was like Nancy Reagan died and she was actually kind of a\n\n18:12.800 --> 18:14.400\nI mean\n\n18:14.400 --> 18:18.320\nIt was a weird day for a lot of people with a lot of gay friends who died back then\n\n18:18.960 --> 18:25.720\nBecause we were sort of in a in a and then and now she's dead and it's like do you spit if you're a 55 year old\n\n18:25.960 --> 18:29.920\nGay guy. Do you go like fuck you? I hope I hope it hurt\n\n18:31.800 --> 18:33.800\nWhen you died\n\n18:33.960 --> 18:35.640\nStop me if I've mentioned this before on the show\n\n18:35.640 --> 18:40.720\nBut like I 20 years after I was in the king and I I went and met the leading lady\n\n18:40.720 --> 18:46.560\nWho was 20 years later, so now I'm like three feet taller and I was 11 when I last saw her now\n\n18:46.560 --> 18:48.560\nI was 31 and she was\n\n18:48.800 --> 18:53.080\n41 when I knew her and now she's 61 and we met with a great talk and at one point\n\n18:53.080 --> 18:58.720\nI said like how is so-and-so and I mentioned all the the dancers and she's like they're all gone and\n\n18:59.200 --> 19:02.120\nAnd I said all of them I go. What about so-and-so? What about so-and-so?\n\n19:02.120 --> 19:05.080\nThey're like they're all dead Jeff they all died like a few years later\n\n19:05.080 --> 19:11.280\nAnd I should the only dancer in the show that wasn't dead was the only straight guy that was married to one of the women dancers\n\n19:11.280 --> 19:15.360\nShe's just everybody else has gone and she goes that also that's just one show\n\n19:15.360 --> 19:19.520\nShe goes all of Broadway died like and not not just our dancers, but\n\n19:20.000 --> 19:25.360\nengineers and artists and you know like doctors and like a huge generation and I\n\n19:26.200 --> 19:28.200\nI'm not the first person to say this or put this\n\n19:28.680 --> 19:33.400\nTheory out there, but I think the idiocracy that we're living in right now and that we the\n\n19:33.400 --> 19:36.040\nThe the candidates that are running to rule the world right now\n\n19:36.040 --> 19:42.360\nI think a lot of it we never recovered from a giant generation of smart people dying like like at once\n\n19:43.080 --> 19:46.720\nLike in the same way the England that never quite recovered from all of its you know\n\n19:47.120 --> 19:50.680\nIntelligent men all all dying in two wars over a couple generations\n\n19:50.680 --> 19:55.520\nAnd you don't you don't get a Churchill anymore you get Cameron and those fucking dick wands you say\n\n19:56.240 --> 19:58.240\nJeff saying Churchill was gay\n\n19:58.240 --> 20:05.720\nWhich I think that's cool, but Churchill you're gonna get flack for that Churchill. Oh, could he suck a dick?\n\n20:07.120 --> 20:09.680\nThat's why he loves cigars. He was practicing the whole time\n\n20:10.760 --> 20:14.360\nThey named the Church of Cigar after him because it was the most like a dick\n\n20:15.640 --> 20:21.760\nThe only thing we have to fear is fear itself and insert stereotype about curtains or prosciutto or something\n\n20:21.760 --> 20:30.800\nI bracketed it. I'm not fucking the whole the whole quote was the only thing we have to fear is fear itself and terrible\n\n20:30.800 --> 20:32.800\nHello, dolly revivals\n\n20:33.960 --> 20:35.960\nAll right, let's bring out a\n\n20:35.960 --> 20:51.960\nRob Schrab\n\n20:51.960 --> 21:05.360\nSo right before I walked out on stage\n\n21:05.880 --> 21:10.400\nHere he let me know I left a t-shirt that he gave me last week\n\n21:10.400 --> 21:13.480\nI didn't I just want to say if you don't want it\n\n21:13.480 --> 21:17.640\nI'll I'll give it to somebody who is that what you're sitting so far.

I'm like I'm trying to I'm just trying to get a try to make it\n\n26:07.680 --> 26:09.680\nBye like everybody else man\n\n26:09.680 --> 26:15.360\nYou know I'm trying to make it by I'm trying to make it by like everybody else make it by a saying\n\n26:16.120 --> 26:18.600\nI'm trying to make it by like everybody else. I\n\n26:19.240 --> 26:22.040\nThink you're trying to convince us that trying to make it by\n\n26:23.200 --> 26:26.760\nI'm trying to make it by everyone Hitler tried to make it by\n\n26:29.520 --> 26:31.520\nIt doesn't even matter if it did or not\n\n26:32.520 --> 26:36.800\nI didn't try to make it by it like everybody else. Yeah, I didn't in a very specific way\n\n26:36.800 --> 26:39.680\nThat's the difference. No, but everyone tries to make it by\n\n26:40.560 --> 26:43.360\nSix million Jews are in their way. I'm just trying to make it\n\n26:43.760 --> 26:48.240\nNo, he thought he thought a lot more Jews were in the way. He fell short of his mark\n\n26:48.800 --> 26:50.800\nThat's that's an important thing to\n\n26:51.640 --> 26:53.640\nsettle\n\n26:53.880 --> 26:59.760\nI get you when Hitler was in the bunker and he's about to blow him him and his dog and his girlfriend or newly\n\n27:00.480 --> 27:02.480\nLike what I just\n\n27:02.480 --> 27:07.280\nI'm just a dog. I just got here. What am I gotta go to?\n\n27:07.560 --> 27:10.840\nThey tried the cyanide out on the dog to make sure the cyanide works\n\n27:10.840 --> 27:16.640\nThey didn't want to do some bogus cyanide because he was so paranoid that he thought maybe somebody gave me some fugezi cyanide\n\n27:16.640 --> 27:20.000\nIt's just gonna make you go sleepy town. I'm gonna wake up in a Russian jail\n\n27:20.440 --> 27:24.920\nAnd so he's like, let's make sure this is actual not kill a dog kill a Hitler cyanide\n\n27:25.280 --> 27:29.220\nAnd he killed his beloved dog that he had one of the only things that\n\n27:29.220 --> 27:32.340\nI'll say like that, but we know that he liked was his dog\n\n27:32.940 --> 27:35.420\nYou know, he had this he was thinking\n\n27:36.340 --> 27:42.100\nLike that two birds with one thing and she's like I want to kill my keys. He killed his whole family, right?\n\n27:42.380 --> 27:45.900\nSo now that was a gerbil's killed his whole family. He killed all the children and shit\n\n27:46.380 --> 27:50.020\nHitler went in and killed Eva Braun himself and but he tried it on the dog first\n\n27:50.020 --> 27:54.660\nOh to make sure and he really liked that dog. I think that was probably the hardest decision. He probably ever made\n\n27:54.660 --> 27:56.660\nI\n\n28:00.820 --> 28:04.260\nKnow that in two minutes, I'm gonna shoot you in the head with my Luger\n\n28:04.900 --> 28:09.980\nBut I don't want to make sure I want to make sure the cyanide we're taking like it's not just knock you out\n\n28:09.980 --> 28:13.020\nEva's like you killed how many Jews give me a\n\n28:13.660 --> 28:20.860\nBrace kill the dog kill the dog. Yeah, the dog is your problem. Wrap it up. The dog. He's worried about wrap it up\n\n28:20.860 --> 28:25.260\nHe's worried about wrap it up. I'm just trying to get by man\n\n28:27.220 --> 28:31.220\nWrap it up. See he just changed. It used to be make it by now. It's trying to get by\n\n28:31.980 --> 28:36.100\nWrap it up, man. Come on. Just wrap it up\n\n28:36.980 --> 28:43.580\nWrap it up. You think that five vacuum this living room one more time. I'm gonna kill myself\n\n28:45.580 --> 28:48.700\nAnd you think they got in a big fight where she's like she's like what are you doing?\n\n28:48.700 --> 28:52.220\nHe's like I'm trying to get out of the dog and she's like why and he's like cuz I don't want it\n\n28:53.500 --> 29:00.540\nHaven't turned out to hurt everybody or anyone to have to suffer and she's like oh mr. Antisuffering all of a sudden\n\n29:00.820 --> 29:04.980\nAnd then he's like wait, what does that mean and she's like come on\n\n29:04.980 --> 29:11.060\nWhat do you think it means give me the pill and he's like wait? No, I'm not killing us until you tell me what the fuck that meant\n\n29:11.060 --> 29:21.260\nBecause I came home and told you I want to kill the Jews and you said that's nice sweetie. You said that's nice sweetie. Don't you fucking turn your back on me now\n\n29:22.180 --> 29:27.980\nThe Russians are at the door. We are about to die. Are we on the same team or not?\n\n29:29.540 --> 29:34.860\nJust give me the just give me the pill. Just give me the pill. It's important to me\n\n29:34.860 --> 29:41.340\nWhy doesn't anyone care about what's important to me Hitler?\n\n29:42.780 --> 29:44.780\nDo you know what a long day I've had\n\n29:46.660 --> 29:49.340\nNo one ever asks what I want\n\n29:58.060 --> 30:00.140\nDo you think Hitler had a certainty issue too?\n\n30:00.140 --> 30:09.500\nYeah, so you think you have that in common you said you said you're it's eight million other people don't have what you have\n\n30:09.500 --> 30:11.500\nBut you think probably Hitler too, right?\n\n30:12.740 --> 30:18.340\nSee right and see I just I just felt a flash of certainty that you were my enemy\n\n30:19.340 --> 30:22.780\nAnd then I just let it float down a river like a lotus leaf\n\n30:22.780 --> 30:30.260\nJust because someone compares you to Hitler doesn't mean they're your enemy exactly. What do I know I?\n\n30:34.420 --> 30:36.420\nKnow my uncle's ghost is here\n\n30:38.300 --> 30:41.740\nBut that's not certainty that's just my ghost busting equipment\n\n30:42.460 --> 30:47.420\nAnd so the EKG's are going up Spencer. Do you relate to that certainty sure?\n\n30:47.420 --> 30:49.980\nDo you have a whole different kind of angle now with me man?\n\n30:49.980 --> 30:57.020\nBut I go what he's saying it sounds like his therapist identified a pattern of self-depeating thinking and tried to get him to\n\n30:57.540 --> 31:03.300\nYou know identify it early on and intervene before it gets out of control. It seems pretty smart. Yeah\n\n31:08.580 --> 31:11.780\nHow about that Ghostbusters, right I\n\n31:13.180 --> 31:17.900\nIntentionally did not watch the trailer even though everybody on Facebook and Twitter is trying to make me watch it\n\n31:17.900 --> 31:21.380\nI don't want it. I don't want to know a single thing about it when I walk in cold to that one\n\n31:21.380 --> 31:24.880\nYeah, I'm not gonna watch it trailers are dumb man those buttons too hot\n\n31:28.820 --> 31:32.940\nI wanted to be good because who doesn't want to enjoy something\n\n31:37.420 --> 31:39.420\nWell\n\n31:40.940 --> 31:43.900\nI agree with that because of course we all want to have fun at all times\n\n31:43.900 --> 31:49.740\nWhat if you didn't agree with that? I didn't know that there was a Batman Superman movie coming out until my lift left\n\n31:49.740 --> 31:54.060\nMiss this young Latina lift driver. She was so you're excited about the new\n\n31:54.820 --> 31:59.980\nSuperman Batman movie like I look up at a billboard like oh, I didn't know there was one and she's like I said she was\n\n31:59.980 --> 32:01.620\nAre you going to go see it? I was like\n\n32:01.620 --> 32:06.980\nYou know if everybody that I like says it's awesome. I'll probably go see it if nobody says it's great\n\n32:06.980 --> 32:11.700\nI won't I will never see it and I go who's playing it. She's Ben Affleck is Batman like not seeing it\n\n32:11.700 --> 32:14.340\nThat's fucking dumb\n\n32:15.180 --> 32:16.820\nDum that does sound super dumb\n\n32:16.820 --> 32:21.260\nI just don't see how I might see it if he never is Bruce Wayne and only has the mask on the whole time\n\n32:21.260 --> 32:23.260\nSo I'd never have to look at his dumb face\n\n32:24.620 --> 32:27.020\nBen Affleck, I know you listen to Harmontown\n\n32:28.820 --> 32:30.820\nYou have a dumb face I\n\n32:31.100 --> 32:35.940\nGuess I must be pickier because I was I was actually only picturing with the mask on and I was still like no\n\n32:35.940 --> 32:42.020\nHe's gonna Bruce Wayne it up. He's he's I guess mostly Bruce Wayne. I think the way they've been selling it. Yeah, that's\n\n32:43.220 --> 32:47.700\nYeah, is he gonna wait who's directing this one is it you some Jack Zack Snyder?\n\n32:48.620 --> 32:50.620\nOkay, is he Zack Snyder?\n\n32:52.060 --> 32:54.580\nNever heard of me. Is uh, do we know what the\n\n32:56.700 --> 32:59.700\nSister is it gonna be a weird nipple nipple Batman or\n\n32:59.700 --> 33:06.140\nUh, it looks more like old-school like Frank Miller Batman. Oh, yeah, it's closer to that\n\n33:06.140 --> 33:09.100\nAre you excited about it Rob? You care about such things. Yeah, I\n\n33:09.780 --> 33:15.780\nStill haven't seen Star Wars keychain me neither me neither. I went I went to Star Wars\n\n33:15.780 --> 33:21.700\nMy I this is the story is gonna start off in a disappointing fashion. I had just done yoga and spin\n\n33:21.700 --> 33:28.700\nAnd then I as one does when you're on a health kick, I went straight to the drawing room to have drinks and\n\n33:30.620 --> 33:32.180\nThen my friends said hey\n\n33:32.180 --> 33:36.420\nWe have an extra ticket to go see Star Wars because it was like the week after it came out\n\n33:36.420 --> 33:42.300\nYou want to come like all right, so I was tired and I'm like if you do yoga and spin and you have three drinks\n\n33:42.980 --> 33:44.780\nYou're sleepy\n\n33:44.780 --> 33:50.460\nSo I fell asleep five minutes into that movie and they had the 3d glasses on and ever after the movie was over\n\n33:50.460 --> 33:52.260\nThey had to wake me up like Jeff\n\n33:52.260 --> 33:54.260\nJeff, I'm like, huh?\n\n33:54.980 --> 33:58.420\nReally five minutes in was asleep. It was a great nap because you got great music and\n\n34:02.700 --> 34:05.520\nAnd they're like, oh, we thought you were just really in the zone\n\n34:12.100 --> 34:17.900\nSo then I said I gotta go see this movie. I'm gonna go see it alone. I'm gonna be rested and be sober\n\n34:17.900 --> 34:22.660\nI'm gonna watch this movie. This is Star Wars Star Wars, and I you're going back to see there was a second time\n\n34:22.660 --> 34:27.100\nNo, this is I'm saying to myself the next week. I'm like, okay. I got to go back and see that I had a dream\n\n34:27.660 --> 34:34.780\nI had a dream or I went to the Vista theater in Los Feliz and saw Star Wars fell asleep in it\n\n34:36.020 --> 34:40.780\nFell asleep in your dream fell asleep in my dream and then my dream my dream was about the dreams\n\n34:40.780 --> 34:42.780\nI had while not watching Star Wars\n\n34:42.780 --> 34:51.300\nSo I'm like, this movie's got to be boring Jeff, you know, we're already impressed by you. You don't have to tell us\n\n34:52.060 --> 34:54.700\nYour dream your dreams don't have to be special\n\n34:56.140 --> 34:58.140\nDan your certainty is really bumming me out\n\n34:58.940 --> 35:02.700\nAll right. Yeah, so you're but here's why you're upset right now\n\n35:02.700 --> 35:07.500\nHere's why you had to undercut me.

I never saw the other omens. I don't I love the first one is great\n\n39:23.300 --> 39:29.980\nIs there more than two?

You could just be a guy that goes\n\n40:40.900 --> 40:45.620\nYeah, it's in his well. I am a lying sociopath, but what's your last name pew?\n\n40:45.820 --> 40:51.000\nYes, and you are the creator of one of the most amazing video games in the world the Stanley parable the co-creator\n\n40:56.460 --> 41:00.380\nAnd you're you're visiting from the UK, so yes\n\n41:00.380 --> 41:04.660\nDo you so you had you've never been in front of a crowd maybe that the exhibit never their size?\n\n41:04.660 --> 41:09.340\nIt's very small. Are you it's just a little island, right? Yeah, yeah, but no\n\n41:09.340 --> 41:14.020\nBut you must have been it you you you it's a critically acclaimed game and it's like it's it's amazing\n\n41:14.020 --> 41:16.520\nSo you've been in front of adoring people before yeah, yeah\n\n41:20.180 --> 41:27.460\nWell, so, so are you an indie so you said you co-created it who's the other person Davey reading okay a girl\n\n41:27.460 --> 41:33.860\nUh, no, Davey. Oh, I see the Debbie. Oh, no, I wish I want this close to fucking applause\n\n41:34.940 --> 41:36.400\nclose\n\n41:36.400 --> 41:40.460\nSo just the two of you partners like like like what's the expertise on both sides?\n\n41:40.580 --> 41:46.780\nYes, so Davey was the main writer and then I kind of did a lot of script editing and then I also did the\n\n41:47.420 --> 41:50.340\nDesign of it. So the Stanley parable is this amazing\n\n41:51.020 --> 41:55.700\nIndie game what was it but like before I explain it to them because I don't fully understand what happened\n\n41:55.700 --> 41:57.700\ndid you go to valve and\n\n41:57.780 --> 41:59.780\nNo, so we\n\n42:00.980 --> 42:06.580\nWe made the game and then we talked we talked to valve and they just publish it. Mm-hmm. Oh, that's the fucking amazing\n\n42:06.580 --> 42:10.420\nSo is that but then they were able to weave in weave it into it's\n\n42:11.060 --> 42:13.060\nAesthetically it kind of matches the oh, yeah\n\n42:13.060 --> 42:18.340\nWell, we were we were poor so we just stole their okay, and they just they just kind of licensed it out right and just yeah\n\n42:18.340 --> 42:20.340\nYeah, that's awesome. Those guys are great\n\n42:20.340 --> 42:25.220\nThe he made this amazing critically acclaimed video game where you\n\n42:26.180 --> 42:28.180\nlook at these guys\n\n42:28.260 --> 42:35.940\nI'm explaining to you guys. I'm into it. Hello. What's your name by the way? William William. What pew pew pew?\n\n42:35.940 --> 42:42.460\nOh pew. Yes, we already insulted, you know all of Britain, you know, I was I insulted Churchill\n\n42:42.460 --> 42:51.500\nYeah, I know I actually I said I insulted Cameron. I like yeah fucking. Yeah shit. Yeah, he's a pig fucker\n\n42:52.620 --> 42:55.380\nHe didn't fuck it. He just put his dick in it\n\n42:58.100 --> 43:04.480\nAll right, so anyways, it's an amazing video game, you know, and you never there's no there's no\n\n43:05.740 --> 43:07.860\nSomebody's given birth to a hemorrhoid am I\n\n43:07.860 --> 43:13.620\nIt's it's it's it's it's like a third-person shooter go for it and then\n\n43:15.380 --> 43:18.860\nBut there's no shooting and you just walk through this thing and it's based on the narration\n\n43:18.860 --> 43:24.260\nThere's a vo that keeps explaining about you in the third person voiceover that stands\n\n43:24.900 --> 43:31.060\nStanley did this and Stanley did that and there's and so you're coordinated with the voiceover up until a definitive point where there's like\n\n43:31.060 --> 43:37.060\nOh a red door and a blue door and then it says so it's been telling you Stanley looked around the room\n\n43:37.060 --> 43:39.940\nWell, there's nothing really to do but look around the room Stanley walked down the hall\n\n43:39.940 --> 43:44.700\nWell, there's only a hall you could walk down, but there comes this definitive point early in the game where there's a red door and a blue door\n\n43:44.700 --> 43:47.700\nI'm paraphrasing. I don't know. It's literally that I can't remember\n\n43:47.700 --> 43:52.820\nBut and then the voiceover says Stanley thought about it for a moment and then walked through the red door\n\n43:52.820 --> 43:56.020\nBut you can do either thing and so you have to decide right in that moment\n\n43:56.020 --> 44:02.220\nAm I gonna keep doing what the voiceover says that I'm doing or am I going to definitively do the opposite? What did you do?\n\n44:02.220 --> 44:12.260\nIt doesn't matter it puts you in that experience and every choice that you make has like this tree of is it a console game or an app game or\n\n44:12.260 --> 44:18.580\nIt's a PC and Mac. All right. Yeah, and what is it? Wait, and there's a tree in it\n\n44:19.780 --> 44:20.700\na\n\n44:20.700 --> 44:22.700\nTree of logic. Yeah\n\n44:22.700 --> 44:27.860\nHow old are you? You look 11 22 Jesus Christ so twice 11 so what is so so?\n\n44:27.860 --> 44:32.620\nSo when that's how they say 22 in England there. I was not twice 11\n\n44:32.940 --> 44:36.180\nYou were 19 when you made it. Yeah, but when do you start?\n\n44:36.180 --> 44:42.500\nSo as you you must you must have been like a little lima bean when you started getting interested in computers. Yeah, I used to be a plant but now\n\n44:43.820 --> 44:47.160\nWhat's your earliest memory of interfacing with a computing machine?\n\n44:47.160 --> 44:53.460\nWhen did you germinate? I think when I was 10 like I learned flash for like animation and so like you started\n\n44:53.460 --> 44:59.860\nThat's when you were coding. Yeah. Yeah, when you when he was twice five. I\n\n45:02.140 --> 45:07.140\nLike those Chelsea boots you got on there, man. Oh, thank you. Those are those are swinging. Oh, where'd you get him get a room?\n\n45:07.820 --> 45:12.620\nLeads leads leads. Oh, they got fucking good boots up. Oh, yeah\n\n45:14.460 --> 45:18.220\nAre you from Leeds? No, I'm near there, but\n\n45:18.220 --> 45:22.980\nYou even where I'm from people don't know where I'm from. So why would you?\n\n45:23.980 --> 45:28.400\nThis goes nowhere. This conversation goes. I'm just trying to give him a shot. What where are you from?\n\n45:28.400 --> 45:30.900\nWhat part of England I am from a\n\n45:31.780 --> 45:36.580\nSmall village called triangle in West Yorkshire triangle. Yes. That's named after the\n\n45:38.860 --> 45:45.060\nYou're from way up north pardon you from way up north then. Yes. Yes, you know it'll be more Bartat. No\n\n45:45.060 --> 45:46.700\nYes, you do\n\n45:46.700 --> 45:52.100\nI'm my I don't know. I wasn't a song. I'm oh, I thought it was a place to Yorkshire. So, oh\n\n45:52.980 --> 45:54.980\nWe please talk about video games now\n\n45:56.660 --> 45:58.660\nCarmen Sandy fucking a go\n\n46:00.980 --> 46:02.980\nSomeone's making chocolate\n\n46:05.540 --> 46:06.580\nSo\n\n46:06.580 --> 46:13.900\nIt's a it's a relatively short period of time since the first day that you started interfacing with a machine and realizing that you could do more than\n\n46:13.900 --> 46:18.460\nJust consume what it was checking out at you and you could make it do what you wanted to around ten years old\n\n46:19.220 --> 46:24.880\nBetween nine years later, you're creating a video game that if a middle-aged man\n\n46:25.380 --> 46:29.140\nHad come up with after decades and decades of interfacing with machines\n\n46:29.180 --> 46:33.740\nThey would have been very very proud of not to mention a middle-aged woman. Don't fucking write letters\n\n46:36.140 --> 46:39.140\nThe the but but like so what's what's\n\n46:39.140 --> 46:44.940\nSo I'm gonna I want to ask you a couple things first. There's a tree of things that I could ask you as a\n\n46:45.420 --> 46:47.420\nkind of parable\n\n46:48.300 --> 46:51.580\nBut like I so what what it when you like\n\n46:52.300 --> 46:56.980\nI think the thing that makes it critically acclaimed is that it has it has a distinct style distinct\n\n46:57.780 --> 47:04.820\nVoice it's like it's it's a it's a video game that has it's it's it's it's it's like a film that's directed and yet you're interacting with it\n\n47:04.820 --> 47:06.820\nSo which of you and your partner are?\n\n47:06.820 --> 47:15.700\nWho's got this like weird passion for subverting the entire like that was both of us? I suppose like um\n\n47:16.540 --> 47:18.540\nYeah, you don't want to throw him under the bus\n\n47:18.980 --> 47:23.700\nNo, you did a lot of very important work, but it was all me, you know, that's the important\n\n47:24.580 --> 47:26.340\nYeah, hi me\n\n47:26.340 --> 47:32.140\nPardon what I mean does this represent are we getting a glimpse since you are so young are we getting a glimpse?\n\n47:32.140 --> 47:38.660\nIt's something that you wish had you the resources like what can you like do you is this what you want to keep doing?\n\n47:38.660 --> 47:42.300\nIs this just yeah, I've my employed people now to do for me\n\n47:42.300 --> 47:47.580\nSo and so and so what's what's your what's your vision of like the ultimate video game? Are you excited about VR?\n\n47:48.020 --> 47:52.020\nYeah, yeah, I'm here to work on a VR thing with Justin actually. All right. I\n\n47:53.300 --> 47:55.740\nWish you would have told me about that but voice rover\n\n47:55.740 --> 48:05.940\nIt was good, but don't go back and look at it\n\n48:11.340 --> 48:14.300\nAre you gonna move the stage nah, nah\n\n48:15.700 --> 48:22.340\nThank you. It's too dry. It's too dry here. Well, it's a desert. There's a whole states. Yeah, you could you could move to Portland\n\n48:22.340 --> 48:30.140\nYou'd be like working slickers. I don't know anything about Portland. It's it's like England, but it's connected to a giant America\n\n48:31.220 --> 48:34.380\nSo you can like you're it's like there's a land bridge to the rest of\n\n48:36.940 --> 48:38.940\nI know some people find it convenient I\n\n48:40.860 --> 48:43.340\nEngland seems to see it looks like I get claustrophobic\n\n48:44.020 --> 48:47.820\nSeems very small. How did it how did it start you like what was the beginning of that?\n\n48:47.820 --> 48:52.420\nHad you already worked on games before? Yeah, I've done stuff called mods. So like you um\n\n48:53.060 --> 48:58.380\nYou take a game that already exists exists like Half-Life or whatever and then you just change things\n\n48:58.380 --> 49:04.340\nYou make things out of the already existing parts and you move it about and that's that's why I did for what kind of mods\n\n49:04.340 --> 49:07.740\nDid you make are they just unofficial just for your own things?\n\n49:07.740 --> 49:11.260\nOh, yeah, I mostly made maps for Team Fortress 2. I also left it dead\n\n49:11.260 --> 49:17.580\nOkay, cool. Oh, so you weren't you weren't an employee of the game manufacturer. Oh, no, no, just doing it on your own now\n\n49:17.580 --> 49:23.060\nI don't think it was legal for them to employ someone that young. Oh, really? Oh, no. No, it was yeah\n\n49:23.060 --> 49:26.060\nIt was my first job. Oh, so you were what under 18 men or yeah\n\n49:26.060 --> 49:31.180\nI I started working on it when I was 17 and then I've got released when I was 19\n\n49:31.180 --> 49:34.460\nSo then you then you had you you learned the skills that you needed to make your own game\n\n49:34.860 --> 49:38.660\nMate, are you coding the whole thing? You're doing it all yourself. There's not that much coding\n\n49:38.660 --> 49:42.460\nI don't know how to code. All right. Yeah, so you just come up with the concept of a game\n\n49:42.460 --> 49:45.020\nthen yes, yes, and and then\n\n49:45.580 --> 49:50.420\nUsing the tools that you get to put that and you go in like it like you're pitching a TV show you pitch\n\n49:50.420 --> 49:51.340\nSo here's a game idea\n\n49:51.340 --> 49:56.260\nI have and you pitch it to this larger company like usually how it works is a rev share and you get the people on the team that you\n\n49:56.260 --> 50:01.940\nNeed to like make it and then you just split the revenue. Wow. Yeah, great. You do you have another game in the works?\n\n50:01.940 --> 50:05.380\nOh, yeah, I a couple cool. That's great. Is it all?\n\n50:05.380 --> 50:10.300\nAnd obviously you're gonna tell me if there's something you don't want to say out loud\n\n50:10.300 --> 50:14.100\nBut is it all 2d or all VR that your next project?\n\n50:15.580 --> 50:19.260\nWe've got two one is 2d and one is fear\n\n50:22.220 --> 50:24.420\nAnd pretty funny every\n\n50:24.420 --> 50:28.420\nI\n\n50:31.820 --> 50:34.980\nGot two of them to the I see how that's hilarious.

Do you think that mankind needs to be governed?\n\n52:02.020 --> 52:06.180\nHere we go\n\n52:08.020 --> 52:11.340\nDepends what you mean governed. How do you mean governor not in a hot way?\n\n52:12.500 --> 52:14.500\nNot like a harness. I\n\n52:15.500 --> 52:23.420\nMean just like like told told what to do.

No, no\n\n53:01.580 --> 53:07.340\nBut you knew what I was talking about. It's a stereotype like how we say all Americans are idiots, you know, it's not now\n\n53:07.340 --> 53:10.420\nBut you know, you know, that's actually not a stereotype. That's true\n\n53:10.420 --> 53:17.260\nThat's that's it's it's not an absolute truth, but it's it's it's heavily backed by like, yeah\n\n53:18.300 --> 53:22.060\n100 years, it's it's an it's an allowable statement\n\n53:23.740 --> 53:30.600\nI do love I mean, I do you live in London, William?

the bar starts to fill up.\n\n01:08:11.660 --> 01:08:13.660\nAnd all of a sudden girls just start gravitating toward this name.\n\n01:08:13.660 --> 01:08:15.660\nThey're like, oh, your accents are so cute.\n\n01:08:15.660 --> 01:08:17.660\nAnd we're just doing it like as a joke.\n\n01:08:17.660 --> 01:08:19.660\nWe think they're going to get their drink and fuck off.\n\n01:08:19.660 -->

invites...\n\n01:08:39.660 --> 01:08:41.660\nNow her posse shows up.\n\n01:08:41.660 --> 01:08:43.660\nShe invites all the other girls over.\n\n01:08:43.660 --> 01:08:45.660\nI was thinking she was going to leave for five minutes.\n\n01:08:45.660 --> 01:08:47.660\nAnd then there's this really hot girl.\n\n01:08:47.660 --> 01:08:49.660\nAnd she goes like, would you...\n\n01:08:49.660 -->

Nancy Reagan.\n\n01:12:54.660 --> 01:12:56.660\nNo!\n\n01:12:56.660 --> 01:12:58.660\nNo!\n\n01:12:58.660 --> 01:13:00.660\nNo!\n\n01:13:00.660 --> 01:13:02.660\nNo!\n\n01:13:05.660 --> 01:13:10.660\nThat's been our show. Goodnight Drive safely, everybody.\n\n01:13:10.660 --> 01:13:12.660\nJust say life's a circle!\n\n01:13:12.660 --> 01:13:14.660\nAlright, back to role-playing.\n\n01:13:14.660 --> 01:13:16.660\nDan, where does role-play for you?\n\n01:13:16.660 --> 01:13:18.660\nWhat's the funkiest, the most specific role-play?\n\n01:13:18.660 --> 01:13:20.660\nThe most complicated design?\n\n01:13:20.660 --> 01:13:22.660\nArt departments...\n\n01:13:22.660 --> 01:13:27.660\nlike setup, like how much lead time did it have to have?\n\n01:13:27.660 --> 01:13:32.660\nI am not at liberty to discuss my sexual role-playing because it's too hot.\n\n01:13:34.660 --> 01:13:37.660\nAre you afraid that we can't handle it? Is that hot?\n\n01:13:37.660 --> 01:13:42.660\nNo, it's just too... I have discovered recently after, you know,\n\n01:13:42.660 --> 01:13:45.660\nafter living my life going like, I wish, you know, when I was on the playground,\n\n01:13:45.660 --> 01:13:50.660\nit was like, hey, hey kid, why you get boogers on your jacket?\n\n01:13:50.660 --> 01:13:54.660\nWell, how can you talk that way, walk that way, and pee that way,\n\n01:13:54.660 --> 01:13:58.660\nand throw a ball that way, and write that way, and talk that way, and think that way?\n\n01:13:58.660 --> 01:14:01.660\nHow can I smell that way, and behave in all that way?\n\n01:14:01.660 --> 01:14:04.660\nWhy are you doing all those things? Why are you doing that?\n\n01:14:04.660 --> 01:14:07.660\nAnd I'd always be like, fuck, god damn it, it's such a bummer, all that happens,\n\n01:14:07.660 --> 01:14:10.660\nand I'm like, fuck it, god damn it, I'm gonna make sure that the answer to that\n\n01:14:10.660 --> 01:14:12.660\nis always because I'm awesome.\n\n01:14:12.660 --> 01:14:15.660\nAnd I just like, just getting more and more tastes of it,\n\n01:14:15.660 --> 01:14:17.660\nand just going like, no, you're gonna fucking kneel before me,\n\n01:14:17.660 --> 01:14:21.660\nand then I was like, why is that the answer is gonna be, why aren't you doing this,\n\n01:14:21.660 --> 01:14:23.660\nthis way, and that way, and that way?\n\n01:14:23.660 --> 01:14:25.660\nAnd then along the way, it was sort of like caught up in this sort of like,\n\n01:14:25.660 --> 01:14:31.660\nwell, the big key to that is like public, you know, spotlight transparency.\n\n01:14:31.660 --> 01:14:35.660\nLike there should be no barrier between what's going on in your head,\n\n01:14:35.660 --> 01:14:38.660\nand what's coming out of your mouth, and what's going on behind closed doors,\n\n01:14:38.660 --> 01:14:41.660\nand because that's everybody else's jam, because they're all ashamed of themselves,\n\n01:14:41.660 --> 01:14:43.660\nand they're all terrible people, they're shadow people,\n\n01:14:43.660 --> 01:14:45.660\nand they want you to be merged with their shadows,\n\n01:14:45.660 --> 01:14:47.660\nand you're just gonna be honest, and you're gonna be who you are,\n\n01:14:47.660 --> 01:14:50.660\nand you're gonna flaunt who you are, and they're gonna not kill you,\n\n01:14:50.660 --> 01:14:52.660\nand that's when you're gonna know you succeed.\n\n01:14:52.660 --> 01:14:55.660\nThen I spent my life like tricking people into situations where they're tempted\n\n01:14:55.660 --> 01:14:58.660\nto try to kill me so I can prove that they can't, so I can be alive,\n\n01:14:58.660 --> 01:15:02.660\nand consider myself a success, and it's just this fucking syndrome,\n\n01:15:02.660 --> 01:15:07.660\nand then I, you know, and it culminated in like a public relationship,\n\n01:15:07.660 --> 01:15:12.660\nand I got married, and now I'm divorced, and it was like, none of it matters,\n\n01:15:12.660 --> 01:15:17.660\nand then I got like, oh, what if where you put your dick,\n\n01:15:17.660 --> 01:15:20.660\nand what you did with it, and what made it hard, and when it came,\n\n01:15:20.660 --> 01:15:24.660\nand where you shot the cum, like what if that was like kind of like, I don't know,\n\n01:15:24.660 --> 01:15:27.660\nwhat if there was a little bit of a box around that,\n\n01:15:27.660 --> 01:15:32.660\nwhat if you made a box around here, and what if everybody that you knew intimately,\n\n01:15:32.660 --> 01:15:37.660\nlike there was a box around them, and it's like, oh, I guess that would be called privacy,\n\n01:15:37.660 --> 01:15:43.660\nand then you could just like, yeah, I mean, I wish, I want nothing more than to be able\n\n01:15:43.660 --> 01:15:46.660\nto tell people like what I get up to when I fuck,\n\n01:15:46.660 --> 01:15:53.660\nbut the fact is society couldn't handle it, and that's why I'm able to cum,\n\n01:15:53.660 --> 01:15:57.660\nthat's the only thing that could ever make me cum, so if I told you, you'd be like,\n\n01:15:57.660 --> 01:16:01.660\nwhoa, and then I'd be like, and then my dick would be like, meh,\n\n01:16:01.660 --> 01:16:05.660\nso then I'd have to go further, and then I'd be like, I'm hard,\n\n01:16:05.660 --> 01:16:09.660\nand you'd be like, that's crazy, and I'm like, yep, it was,\n\n01:16:09.660 --> 01:16:14.660\nand then so I'm in a sweet spot, I got some tricks, I got some costumes.\n\n01:16:14.660 --> 01:16:18.660\nI admire you like having that privacy for yourself, that's good.\n\n01:16:18.660 --> 01:16:23.660\nYeah, your sexuality like should be sexy, and it should be your own dirty little secret.\n\n01:16:23.660 --> 01:16:30.660\nI go to criminal places, terrible, low, ethically horrible places.\n\n01:16:30.660 --> 01:16:35.660\nI'm not coming until like, well that's not true.\n\n01:16:35.660 --> 01:16:39.660\nAll the time it's like, you know, I just want to make sure,\n\n01:16:39.660 --> 01:16:42.660\nbecause it's like, whoa, what if you can only go to that place?\n\n01:16:42.660 --> 01:16:48.660\nNo, but I'm saying like, I go to terrible, terrible, dark, dark crevices\n\n01:16:48.660 --> 01:16:55.660\nof the human imagination, because you're not supposed to.\n\n01:16:55.660 --> 01:16:59.660\nBut with somebody who's consensually into that too.\n\n01:16:59.660 --> 01:17:03.660\nNo, God, no, consent, no.\n\n01:17:03.660 --> 01:17:06.660\nNo, oh God, no, Jeff, that's the whole point.\n\n01:17:06.660 --> 01:17:10.660\nYes, yes!\n\n01:17:10.660 --> 01:17:15.660\nWith a consent to good dogs.\n\n01:17:15.660 --> 01:17:20.660\nYes, but it's horrible, and there's really no way it never wouldn't be horrible.\n\n01:17:20.660 --> 01:17:25.660\nLike, that's a thing, it's like, oh, let's all live in this society\n\n01:17:25.660 --> 01:17:28.660\nwhere we all kind of talk about everything, and all the language is monitored,\n\n01:17:28.660 --> 01:17:31.660\nand if you say this, then you intend this, but that's not really true,\n\n01:17:31.660 --> 01:17:33.660\nbecause we know that the people that are really good at saying things right\n\n01:17:33.660 --> 01:17:35.660\nare some of the worst people in the world.\n\n01:17:35.660 --> 01:17:38.660\nAnd then we're down here policing each other's language,\n\n01:17:38.660 --> 01:17:40.660\nbecause we're so caught up in the idea of language being intent,\n\n01:17:40.660 --> 01:17:43.660\nbut we're still disguising it down here, because when you get behind closed doors,\n\n01:17:43.660 --> 01:17:47.660\nit's all about, like, it's thought, and it's intent and stuff,\n\n01:17:47.660 --> 01:17:50.660\nand it's like, the way you treat each other, it should be,\n\n01:17:50.660 --> 01:17:55.660\nI don't know where to go with that, but it's a lot of babysitter stuff.\n\n01:17:55.660 --> 01:18:01.660\nThat's a short answer, the short answer is babysitter stuff.\n\n01:18:01.660 --> 01:18:06.660\nShort answer is it's a lot of babysitter stuff, but, you know, it's beyond that.\n\n01:18:06.660 --> 01:18:10.660\nOkay, that's the baseline.\n\n01:18:10.660 --> 01:18:12.660\nThanks for taking care of my kids.\n\n01:18:12.660 --> 01:18:14.660\nHave you ever dressed up either yourself or your...\n\n01:18:14.660 --> 01:18:15.660\nNo, my wife's working at the hospital.\n\n01:18:15.660 --> 01:18:19.660\nHave you ever dressed up as yourself or your Leva, as you call her?\n\n01:18:19.660 --> 01:18:23.660\nIn period costume, have you ever gone into a different era?\n\n01:18:23.660 --> 01:18:27.660\nWell, yes, the 80s.\n\n01:18:27.660 --> 01:18:36.660\nYes, my high school, yes.\n\n01:18:36.660 --> 01:18:38.660\nOkay, that's good, I like that.\n\n01:18:38.660 --> 01:18:42.660\nBut, no, nothing, no dangerous liaisons, kind of like,\n\n01:18:42.660 --> 01:18:44.660\noh, Oscar-worthy stuff, yes.\n\n01:18:44.660 --> 01:18:47.660\nWilliam, do you go into the costume realm?\n\n01:18:47.660 --> 01:18:51.660\nYeah, well, as an actor, what I get is I get the...\n\n01:18:51.660 --> 01:18:54.660\nWhat's your favorite film that you've been in?\n\n01:18:54.660 --> 01:18:57.660\nOh, The Independence Day.\n\n01:18:57.660 --> 01:18:58.660\nAlright.\n\n01:18:58.660 --> 01:19:00.660\nSee, we're role-playing right now.\n\n01:19:00.660 --> 01:19:02.660\nThe Independence Day.\n\n01:19:02.660 --> 01:19:03.660\nYeah, The Independence Day.\n\n01:19:03.660 --> 01:19:04.660\nHello, yeah.\n\n01:19:04.660 --> 01:19:07.660\nYeah.\n\n01:19:07.660 --> 01:19:11.660\nHow did people in England...\n\n01:19:11.660 --> 01:19:14.660\nThat was a hit movie, I'm assuming it was kind of a global...\n\n01:19:14.660 --> 01:19:18.660\nLike, somebody in London must have wanted to go see Independence Day.\n\n01:19:18.660 --> 01:19:21.660\nWell, you were not born for 80 years.\n\n01:19:21.660 --> 01:19:24.660\nSo, I guess I'm not, I'm asking the wrong person,\n\n01:19:24.660 --> 01:19:26.660\nbut I'm just curious, they're like, oh,\n\n01:19:26.660 --> 01:19:28.660\nthere's another big American Explodum-up movie,\n\n01:19:28.660 --> 01:19:31.660\nand then it's just like, this is our Independence Day.\n\n01:19:31.660 --> 01:19:34.660\nI'm like, well, alright.\n\n01:19:34.660 --> 01:19:36.660\nYeah, rub it in.\n\n01:19:36.660 --> 01:19:39.660\nCan't aliens attack and it not be about this fucking thing\n\n01:19:39.660 --> 01:19:40.660\nyou keep bringing up?\n\n01:19:40.660 --> 01:19:43.660\nWe used to rule the world down.\n\n01:19:43.660 --> 01:19:44.660\nNot anymore.\n\n01:19:44.660 --> 01:19:45.660\nLike those aliens?\n\n01:19:45.660 --> 01:19:50.660\nThe aliens were an allegory for the British.\n\n01:19:50.660 --> 01:19:52.660\nBut don't you think the British pilots,\n\n01:19:52.660 --> 01:19:55.660\nbecause right there are a bunch of international pilots on that tarmac,\n\n01:19:55.660 --> 01:19:57.660\nwhen Bill Pullman's making the speech of that movie,\n\n01:19:57.660 --> 01:19:59.660\nisn't there like a good...\n\n01:19:59.660 --> 01:20:02.660\nThey should have a shot of like 20 British guys\n\n01:20:02.660 --> 01:20:04.660\npulling off flight helmets and going like,\n\n01:20:04.660 --> 01:20:08.660\nyou know what, if you're going to make it fucking complicated for us,\n\n01:20:08.660 --> 01:20:10.660\nhow did it sign on to this allegory?\n\n01:20:10.660 --> 01:20:13.660\nAnd that scene is absolutely ripping off Shakespeare,\n\n01:20:13.660 --> 01:20:15.660\nthat's the St. Crispin's Day speech.\n\n01:20:15.660 --> 01:20:19.660\nSo like, yeah, that's in your face, England.\n\n01:20:19.660 --> 01:20:20.660\nHey!\n\n01:20:20.660 --> 01:20:22.660\nNo, I'm on your side.\n\n01:20:22.660 --> 01:20:25.660\nI think that's us needlessly rubbing it in.\n\n01:20:25.660 --> 01:20:29.660\nDid you know that Shakespeare invented the word eyeball?\n\n01:20:29.660 --> 01:20:34.660\nOh, God, he's going to bring this up again.\n\n01:20:34.660 --> 01:20:36.660\nYou guys are stepping at each other.\n\n01:20:36.660 --> 01:20:37.660\nIs that true?\n\n01:20:37.660 --> 01:20:38.660\nYes.\n\n01:20:38.660 --> 01:20:40.660\nYeah, is it true?\n\n01:20:40.660 --> 01:20:42.660\nYes, eyeball.\n\n01:20:42.660 --> 01:20:44.660\nCan you make up the word bump?\n\n01:20:44.660 --> 01:20:45.660\nYes, bump.\n\n01:20:45.660 --> 01:20:47.660\nAmazement, compromise.\n\n01:20:47.660 --> 01:20:48.660\nUncomfortable.\n\n01:20:48.660 --> 01:20:51.660\nUncomfortable, except comfortable already existed.\n\n01:20:51.660 --> 01:20:53.660\nSo, partial credit.\n\n01:20:53.660 --> 01:20:54.660\nWe'll give it to him.\n\n01:20:54.660 --> 01:20:57.660\nThis is a promotion for my new show, Great Minds, on the History Channel.\n\n01:20:57.660 --> 01:21:04.660\nNow, here's where I...\n\n01:21:04.660 --> 01:21:06.660\nHere's my beef with Shakespeare.\n\n01:21:06.660 --> 01:21:08.660\nBecause of Iambic pentameter...\n\n01:21:08.660 --> 01:21:09.660\nHere we go.\n\n01:21:09.660 --> 01:21:14.660\nBecause of Iambic pentameter's strict rules, it has to be Romeo, Romeo.\n\n01:21:14.660 --> 01:21:15.660\nWhere for art the Roman...\n\n01:21:15.660 --> 01:21:16.660\nIt's Romeo.\n\n01:21:16.660 --> 01:21:20.660\nBut you can't say Romeo because it fucks up the Iambic pentameter.\n\n01:21:20.660 --> 01:21:22.660\nNo one wants to say Romeo.\n\n01:21:22.660 --> 01:21:23.660\nYeah.\n\n01:21:23.660 --> 01:21:24.660\nThey're from Italy.\n\n01:21:24.660 --> 01:21:25.660\nThey're from Italy.\n\n01:21:25.660 --> 01:21:26.660\nNo one in Italy calls it...\n\n01:21:26.660 --> 01:21:29.660\nYeah, if they would have called it Romeo, it would have been famous.\n\n01:21:29.660 --> 01:21:34.660\nIt would have been huge.\n\n01:21:34.660 --> 01:21:35.660\nThey would have got that right.\n\n01:21:35.660 --> 01:21:38.660\nNow, Rob, back to your biscuits.\n\n01:21:38.660 --> 01:21:39.660\nDelicious.\n\n01:21:39.660 --> 01:21:42.660\nYou say you put jam on them, but I think they're fine just on their own.\n\n01:21:42.660 --> 01:21:44.660\nYou
