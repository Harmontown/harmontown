think.\n\n01:42.000 --> 01:44.000\nWhat if you could get fucked by anybody's mom?\n\n01:44.000 --> 01:48.000\nLet's say the mom was doing the fucking on you.\n\n01:48.000 --> 01:49.000\nYou're like famous moms.\n\n01:49.000 --> 01:52.000\nA famous mom just chose you.\n\n01:52.000 --> 01:54.000\nYou're the target.\n\n01:54.000 --> 01:58.000\nYo, Mrs. Whistler, why are you fucking me so hard?\n\n01:58.000 --> 02:01.000\nIt's only one famous mother ever.\n\n02:01.000 --> 02:03.000\nAlright, let's cut it.\n\n02:03.000 --> 02:12.000\nWe're not going to, the only thing worse than a low energy show is a forced resistance to a low energy show with a terrible rap.\n\n02:12.000 --> 02:15.000\nI can't believe you only think there's only one famous mother.\n\n02:15.000 --> 02:17.000\nName another famous mother.\n\n02:17.000 --> 02:20.000\nMrs. Doubtfire.\n\n02:20.000 --> 02:21.000\nThe original.\n\n02:21.000 --> 02:24.000\nMrs. C from Happy Days.\n\n02:24.000 --> 02:25.000\nAlright.\n\n02:25.000 --> 02:32.000\nStart the beat again, and let's say you're getting fucked by Mrs. Cunningham from Happy Days, or you're fucking anybody in Happy Days.\n\n02:32.000 --> 02:33.000\nHit the beat.\n\n02:33.000 --> 02:34.000\nWait, I'm...\n\n02:34.000 --> 02:46.000\nDan, don't fight me on this.\n\n02:46.000 --> 02:47.000\nI'm Mrs. Cunningham.\n\n02:47.000 --> 02:52.000\nC-U-N-N-I-G-I-G-H-A-M.\n\n02:52.000 --> 02:54.000\nSay it again.\n\n02:54.000 --> 02:56.000\nSpell it one more time.\n\n02:56.000 --> 02:57.000\nMrs. Cunningham.\n\n02:57.000 --> 03:02.000\nC-U-N-N-I-G-I-H-G-I-G-I-M.\n\n03:02.000 --> 03:04.000\nMrs. Cunningham.\n\n03:04.000 --> 03:07.000\nI make a stunning ham for Thanksgiving.\n\n03:07.000 --> 03:08.000\nI make more than that.\n\n03:08.000 --> 03:15.000\nI'm always in the kitchen with a clit the size of a bat.\n\n03:15.000 --> 03:20.000\nIt might be a penis.\n\n03:20.000 --> 03:25.000\nI might have a dick when we're getting to that size.\n\n03:25.000 --> 03:33.000\nAnd I don't know why I'm...\n\n03:33.000 --> 03:37.000\nAre you saying that Marion Ross has a clit the size of a bat?\n\n03:37.000 --> 03:38.000\nNo, it's the character.\n\n03:38.000 --> 03:40.000\nOr the character of Mrs. Cunningham.\n\n03:40.000 --> 03:41.000\nYeah.\n\n03:41.000 --> 03:42.000\nAlright.\n\n03:42.000 --> 03:44.000\nWe've had enough like that.\n\n03:44.000 --> 03:45.000\nThank you.\n\n03:45.000 --> 03:47.000\nWe've had enough.\n\n03:47.000 --> 03:50.000\nThe rap's not getting better as the suggestions get harder.\n\n03:50.000 --> 03:51.000\nIt kinda was.\n\n03:51.000 --> 03:53.000\nAlright, now do it.\n\n03:53.000 --> 03:56.000\nNo, I'm not saying we should continue, but that was great.\n\n03:56.000 --> 03:57.000\nThat was fucking...\n\n03:57.000 --> 03:59.000\nThat was inflammatory.\n\n03:59.000 --> 04:00.000\nYeah, it got bad.\n\n04:00.000 --> 04:01.000\nIt got problematic.\n\n04:01.000 --> 04:03.000\nWhen I'm at this energy level,\n\n04:03.000 --> 04:05.000\nwe don't wanna like force me to do tricks\n\n04:05.000 --> 04:07.000\nbecause then I'm gonna end up like...\n\n04:07.000 --> 04:09.000\nI'll say the n-word before the night's over.\n\n04:09.000 --> 04:10.000\nI'm so tired.\n\n04:10.000 --> 04:12.000\nI don't have any resistance.\n\n04:12.000 --> 04:16.000\nThe whole point of the genre is to break boundaries.\n\n04:16.000 --> 04:18.000\nI know, but it's not...\n\n04:18.000 --> 04:20.000\nNo, no.\n\n04:20.000 --> 04:23.000\nThat's what you said before I played the Chevy Chase voicemail.\n\n04:23.000 --> 04:25.000\nThat just didn't help anyone.\n\n04:25.000 --> 04:27.000\nWhat I said before I played the Chevy Chase voicemail\n\n04:27.000 --> 04:29.000\nwas, Dan, do you want to play it off my phone?\n\n04:29.000 --> 04:32.000\nBecause I can plug it in over here.\n\n04:32.000 --> 04:35.000\nYou guys didn't have plugs back then.\n\n04:35.000 --> 04:36.000\nCome on.\n\n04:36.000 --> 04:37.000\nSo anyways...\n\n04:37.000 --> 04:38.000\nOh, okay.\n\n04:38.000 --> 04:39.000\nI mean, there's nothing to get to.\n\n04:39.000 --> 04:40.000\nThere's no show to do.\n\n04:40.000 --> 04:43.000\nI was thinking we might play D&D for like two hours tonight.\n\n04:43.000 --> 04:44.000\nLet's do it.\n\n04:44.000 --> 04:45.000\nI'm just not feeling...\n\n04:45.000 --> 04:47.000\nYou know, part of it is the video game brain.\n\n04:47.000 --> 04:48.000\nLike, I was playing...\n\n04:48.000 --> 04:50.000\nI was having a good time at home.\n\n04:50.000 --> 04:51.000\nI played video games.\n\n04:51.000 --> 04:52.000\nI played Star Wars Battlefront.\n\n04:52.000 --> 04:53.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n04:53.000 --> 04:54.000\nI was thinking about that one.\n\n04:54.000 --> 04:55.000\nSo good, man.\n\n04:55.000 --> 04:56.000\nIt's really fun.\n\n04:56.000 --> 04:57.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n04:57.000 --> 04:58.000\nIt reminds me...\n\n04:58.000 --> 04:59.000\nWhat was the name?\n\n04:59.000 --> 05:01.000\nYou're probably too young even to remember.\n\n05:01.000 --> 05:02.000\nLike, yeah.\n\n05:02.000 --> 05:03.000\nThere was an original...\n\n05:03.000 --> 05:05.000\nThere was like a game that was...\n\n05:05.000 --> 05:07.000\nI think it was Dark Forces,\n\n05:07.000 --> 05:10.000\nwhere you're like a dude that's like a Jedi.\n\n05:10.000 --> 05:12.000\nYou're not Luke Skywalker,\n\n05:12.000 --> 05:14.000\nbut you're just like this dude that's a Jedi.\n\n05:14.000 --> 05:15.000\nAnd there's like...\n\n05:15.000 --> 05:16.000\nSay what?\n\n05:16.000 --> 05:17.000\nKyle Katarn.\n\n05:17.000 --> 05:19.000\nOh, Kyle Katarn is the name of the dude.\n\n05:19.000 --> 05:20.000\nIs it Force Rising?\n\n05:20.000 --> 05:21.000\nYeah, it was like a...\n\n05:21.000 --> 05:24.000\nIt was like one of my first PC games,\n\n05:24.000 --> 05:26.000\nand it was like on a CD-ROM,\n\n05:26.000 --> 05:27.000\nand it had like all this shitty video...\n\n05:27.000 --> 05:28.000\nExcuse me.\n\n05:28.000 --> 05:31.000\nVideo footage of like, you know,\n\n05:31.000 --> 05:34.000\nactors that were probably getting like $300 to be covered\n\n05:34.000 --> 05:36.000\nin prosthetics against green screens,\n\n05:36.000 --> 05:37.000\nand like come out,\n\n05:37.000 --> 05:40.000\nand like the cutscenes were all video.\n\n05:40.000 --> 05:42.000\nThat was a special era in gaming.\n\n05:42.000 --> 05:44.000\nBut it was a really good game,\n\n05:44.000 --> 05:45.000\nbecause it was like...\n\n05:45.000 --> 05:48.000\nI think that was like the first time you ever got to like,\n\n05:48.000 --> 05:52.000\nin a first-person shooter from Lucasfilm,\n\n05:52.000 --> 05:53.000\nyou were like using a lightsaber,\n\n05:53.000 --> 05:56.000\nand you were like leveling up these force powers.\n\n05:56.000 --> 05:59.000\nSo, this game is...\n\n05:59.000 --> 06:00.000\nIt's not...\n\n06:00.000 --> 06:01.000\nThe focus isn't on that,\n\n06:01.000 --> 06:04.000\nor as I only played like the first third of it or something,\n\n06:04.000 --> 06:07.000\nlike, but you're like this woman\n\n06:07.000 --> 06:09.000\nwho's a special forces stormtrooper.\n\n06:09.000 --> 06:11.000\nIt's really cool.\n\n06:11.000 --> 06:13.000\nIt's just the gameplay is like a really nice balance\n\n06:13.000 --> 06:15.000\nof like you can just dick around\n\n06:15.000 --> 06:17.000\nand like jump and fucking shoot,\n\n06:17.000 --> 06:20.000\nand like it just splits the perfect difference\n\n06:20.000 --> 06:23.000\nbetween like games where like Wolfenstein 2,\n\n06:23.000 --> 06:26.000\nlike I'm 44, so I just opened Wolfenstein 2,\n\n06:26.000 --> 06:27.000\nand I was like,\n\n06:27.000 --> 06:28.000\nI played a couple levels,\n\n06:28.000 --> 06:29.000\nand I'm like this is cool,\n\n06:29.000 --> 06:30.000\nbut it's not...\n\n06:30.000 --> 06:32.000\nI'm never going to enjoy this game,\n\n06:32.000 --> 06:34.000\nbecause it's just going to be like running and gunning,\n\n06:34.000 --> 06:35.000\nand I'm never going to be good,\n\n06:35.000 --> 06:39.000\nand I'm always going to be bummed out and anxious.\n\n06:39.000 --> 06:40.000\nAnd then there's,\n\n06:40.000 --> 06:41.000\non the other side of the spectrum,\n\n06:41.000 --> 06:43.000\nthere's like games that are so role-play\n\n06:43.000 --> 06:45.000\nthat you're just like walking around,\n\n06:45.000 --> 06:46.000\nhaving conversations with people,\n\n06:46.000 --> 06:47.000\nand you kind of get bored,\n\n06:47.000 --> 06:49.000\nbut like right in the middle there,\n\n06:49.000 --> 06:51.000\nit's really nice, really good gameplay.\n\n06:51.000 --> 06:52.000\nYou just like...\n\n06:52.000 --> 06:53.000\nI like those,\n\n06:53.000 --> 06:55.000\nI like those shooters where like you,\n\n06:55.000 --> 06:56.000\nyou touch the left trigger,\n\n06:56.000 --> 06:58.000\nand if you're close enough to the person's head,\n\n06:58.000 --> 07:00.000\nit like zooms in on their head,\n\n07:00.000 --> 07:02.000\nand you shoot them in the head.\n\n07:02.000 --> 07:04.000\nThis probably has an inappropriate time\n\n07:04.000 --> 07:05.000\nin our nation's history to be...\n\n07:05.000 --> 07:06.000\nNo, it's great.\n\n07:06.000 --> 07:09.000\nBut I mean, I should probably...\n\n07:09.000 --> 07:11.000\nI should probably wait six days\n\n07:11.000 --> 07:13.000\nand play the market,\n\n07:13.000 --> 07:16.000\nand hope that we're seven days from a mass shooting.\n\n07:16.000 --> 07:18.000\nYeah, no shootings will happen.\n\n07:18.000 --> 07:19.000\nBut anyways,\n\n07:19.000 --> 07:21.000\nit's a really good game.\n\n07:21.000 --> 07:24.000\nBattlefront 2, I recommend it.\n\n07:24.000 --> 07:27.000\nWhat platform is it on?\n\n07:27.000 --> 07:29.000\nI'm playing it on my Xbox.\n\n07:29.000 --> 07:31.000\nI don't know what it's all on.\n\n07:31.000 --> 07:34.000\nAnd then another game that I saw,\n\n07:34.000 --> 07:36.000\nI stayed up all night playing that,\n\n07:36.000 --> 07:41.000\nand then the game that I played all day today\n\n07:41.000 --> 07:43.000\nwas Portal Knights.\n\n07:43.000 --> 07:45.000\nHave you heard of Portal Knights?\n\n07:45.000 --> 07:46.000\nNo.\n\n07:46.000 --> 07:49.000\nIt's like somebody looked at Minecraft and thought,\n\n07:49.000 --> 07:51.000\nthis isn't...\n\n07:51.000 --> 07:52.000\nPortals.\n\n07:52.000 --> 07:54.000\nThis isn't comfy enough.\n\n07:54.000 --> 07:56.000\nIt's like a very polished,\n\n07:56.000 --> 08:00.000\nlike, adventure-y RPG kind of Minecraft thing.\n\n08:00.000 --> 08:01.000\nOh yeah, okay.\n\n08:01.000 --> 08:02.000\nThat's cool.\n\n08:02.000 --> 08:07.000\nI got sucked in pretty hard.\n\n08:07.000 --> 08:11.000\nAnd so because I had a good time playing video games today,\n\n08:11.000 --> 08:13.000\nit does something to your brain,\n\n08:13.000 --> 08:15.000\nlike it fucks up your alpha waves or something.\n\n08:15.000 --> 08:18.000\nYou never play video games like that,\n\n08:18.000 --> 08:20.000\nbut you hate that.\n\n08:20.000 --> 08:23.000\nThe only games I really liked was the first-person shooter,\n\n08:23.000 --> 08:25.000\nlike historical ones, like Call of Duty's\n\n08:25.000 --> 08:27.000\nand Medal of Honor's and stuff.\n\n08:27.000 --> 08:29.000\nYou'd love Battlefront.\n\n08:29.000 --> 08:30.000\nBattlefront?\n\n08:30.000 --> 08:31.000\nYeah.\n\n08:31.000 --> 08:32.000\nBattlefront.\n\n08:32.000 --> 08:34.000\nHere's the thing that's great about the Star Wars games,\n\n08:34.000 --> 08:35.000\nwhen they're done right.\n\n08:35.000 --> 08:36.000\nThere's a bunch of shitty ones,\n\n08:36.000 --> 08:38.000\nbecause there's a bunch of Lucasfilm games,\n\n08:38.000 --> 08:40.000\nbut the really good ones, it's so cool.\n\n08:40.000 --> 08:43.000\nJust having the John Williams score playing\n\n08:43.000 --> 08:44.000\nwhile you're playing a shooter,\n\n08:44.000 --> 08:46.000\nand especially if it's a good enough game\n\n08:46.000 --> 08:48.000\nthat it kind of...\n\n08:48.000 --> 08:49.000\nIt comes in and out.\n\n08:49.000 --> 08:52.000\nWell, it uses the music to...\n\n08:52.000 --> 08:54.000\nWhen you aggro a stormtrooper,\n\n08:54.000 --> 08:56.000\nit turns into a little...\n\n08:56.000 --> 08:57.000\nYeah.\n\n08:57.000 --> 09:00.000\nAnd then you finish shooting all the stormtroopers\n\n09:00.000 --> 09:02.000\nin the area, and it kind of just very gracefully\n\n09:02.000 --> 09:05.000\ngoes into this more wistful...\n\n09:08.000 --> 09:11.000\nYou know, I've been playing chess with friends.\n\n09:11.000 --> 09:13.000\nOh, I've been seeing some of your moves.\n\n09:13.000 --> 09:14.000\nChess with friends?\n\n09:14.000 --> 09:17.000\nYeah, it's like words with friends, but it's chess.\n\n09:17.000 --> 09:19.000\nAnd I was at the drawing room, and a cat comes up to me,\n\n09:19.000 --> 09:21.000\nand he goes, he saw me sitting there\n\n09:21.000 --> 09:24.000\nplaying chess with somebody else, like on my phone.\n\n09:24.000 --> 09:26.000\nAnd he's a Harmontown fan.\n\n09:26.000 --> 09:27.000\nHis name escapes me.\n\n09:27.000 --> 09:30.000\nHis name is, like, online, something like Cap Slap,\n\n09:30.000 --> 09:31.000\nor Slappy Clappy.\n\n09:31.000 --> 09:32.000\nSlapping Cap.\n\n09:32.000 --> 09:35.000\nAnd I'm going to beat that motherfucker.\n\n09:35.000 --> 09:38.000\nI was playing that for a little bit,\n\n09:38.000 --> 09:40.000\nbut it just takes so long.\n\n09:40.000 --> 09:41.000\nIt's like chess by mail.\n\n09:41.000 --> 09:43.000\nWell, yeah, it depends on your playing.\n\n09:43.000 --> 09:45.000\nSome people play really fast, you know,\n\n09:45.000 --> 09:47.000\nbut I don't want to have to play, like,\n\n09:47.000 --> 09:48.000\nspeed chess with somebody.\n\n09:48.000 --> 09:49.000\nYeah, for sure.\n\n09:49.000 --> 09:50.000\nYeah.\n\n09:50.000 --> 09:54.000\nI would need it to be a zero-sum speed chess.\n\n09:54.000 --> 10:00.000\nEven if I could remember how all the horsies move,\n\n10:00.000 --> 10:03.000\nlike, which I can't, I would have to have it be speed chess,\n\n10:03.000 --> 10:05.000\nand I would always lose.\n\n10:05.000 --> 10:08.000\nBut I would at least need the excuse to, like, make a move.\n\n10:08.000 --> 10:09.000\nRight.\n\n10:09.000 --> 10:10.000\nBecause my understanding of chess is, like,\n\n10:10.000 --> 10:14.000\nwell, theoretically, you could sit there forever.\n\n10:14.000 --> 10:15.000\nLike, so why wouldn't you?\n\n10:15.000 --> 10:17.000\nLike, chess freaks me out.\n\n10:17.000 --> 10:19.000\nWell, the people I play tend to, like,\n\n10:19.000 --> 10:21.000\na few of the people I play are from the drawing room,\n\n10:21.000 --> 10:24.000\nand so I can tell when somebody's drunk when they're playing me\n\n10:24.000 --> 10:25.000\nbecause they make a bullshit move,\n\n10:25.000 --> 10:26.000\nand they also know when I'm drunk\n\n10:26.000 --> 10:28.000\nand I've made a bullshit move.\n\n10:28.000 --> 10:30.000\nAnd sometimes I go, I want to win this one.\n\n10:30.000 --> 10:31.000\nI'm going to go to sleep,\n\n10:31.000 --> 10:33.000\nand I'm going to play them in the morning.\n\n10:33.000 --> 10:37.000\nAnd it's improving my brain.\n\n10:37.000 --> 10:38.000\nDamn.\n\n10:38.000 --> 10:41.000\nI mean, a note of anything at all.\n\n10:41.000 --> 10:44.000\nMy contentment and also my kind of, like,\n\n10:44.000 --> 10:46.000\nyou know, it's part contentment and part, like,\n\n10:46.000 --> 10:48.000\nI just don't like the world anymore.\n\n10:48.000 --> 10:49.000\nI don't trust people.\n\n10:49.000 --> 10:52.000\nI don't have faith in humanity anymore.\n\n10:52.000 --> 10:56.000\nSo I kind of just, let's see if I did bother\n\n10:56.000 --> 10:59.000\nto write anything down throughout the week.\n\n10:59.000 --> 11:01.000\nI can feel the subscriptions dropping,\n\n11:01.000 --> 11:02.000\nwhich is fine.\n\n11:02.000 --> 11:06.000\nThat's democracy.\n\n11:06.000 --> 11:09.000\nWhen you said Mrs. C's clip was the size of a bat,\n\n11:09.000 --> 11:11.000\nwere you talking about baseball bat,\n\n11:11.000 --> 11:12.000\nlike Louisville Slugger,\n\n11:12.000 --> 11:14.000\nor were you talking about, like, a fruit bat?\n\n11:14.000 --> 11:15.000\nA vampire bat?\n\n11:15.000 --> 11:16.000\nNo, no.\n\n11:16.000 --> 11:21.000\nI meant a stick, a big, long stick.\n\n11:21.000 --> 11:24.000\nThat's pretty big.\n\n11:24.000 --> 11:27.000\nLet's say you were on a date with Mrs. Cunningham,\n\n11:27.000 --> 11:31.000\nand you lifted up her skirt, and you saw her clip.\n\n11:31.000 --> 11:33.000\nWould you rather it be the size of a baseball bat,\n\n11:33.000 --> 11:37.000\nor did you want her to look exactly like a vampire bat?\n\n11:37.000 --> 11:38.000\nI don't want.\n\n11:38.000 --> 11:41.000\nI mean, I don't know if this is going to go over well.\n\n11:41.000 --> 11:43.000\nI'm giving you a choice.\n\n11:43.000 --> 11:47.000\nI don't want, if you're a woman, listener, subscriber,\n\n11:47.000 --> 11:50.000\nand you have an enlarged clitoris,\n\n11:50.000 --> 11:52.000\nI don't want you to, I'm not,\n\n11:52.000 --> 11:54.000\nyou should feel good about yourself.\n\n11:54.000 --> 11:56.000\nI have all kinds of things about my body\n\n11:56.000 --> 11:58.000\nthat you can take or leave,\n\n11:58.000 --> 12:00.000\nbut you're asking me the question.\n\n12:00.000 --> 12:03.000\nI don't want a giant,\n\n12:03.000 --> 12:06.000\nI don't want a clitoris that's bigger than my penis.\n\n12:06.000 --> 12:07.000\nI'm a woman.\n\n12:07.000 --> 12:08.000\nWould you be more credible?\n\n12:08.000 --> 12:09.000\nThat basically is a penis.\n\n12:09.000 --> 12:12.000\nWhat if her clitoris looked like a bat?\n\n12:12.000 --> 12:15.000\nLike a fruit bat, or a vampire bat.\n\n12:15.000 --> 12:17.000\nIt looked like a batman.\n\n12:17.000 --> 12:19.000\nNo, I mean, that would be crazy.\n\n12:19.000 --> 12:22.000\nThat would be distracting and crazy.\n\n12:22.000 --> 12:24.000\nI'm giving you the choice.\n\n12:24.000 --> 12:25.000\nI'm saying you got a point.\n\n12:25.000 --> 12:27.000\nNo, you're trying to help the show, but...\n\n12:27.000 --> 12:30.000\nI'm trying to ask a journalistic question, Dan,\n\n12:30.000 --> 12:33.000\nthat I think a lot of people want to know the answer to.\n\n12:33.000 --> 12:36.000\nWhat does Dan Harmon feel about baseball bat clits\n\n12:36.000 --> 12:38.000\nor fruit bat clits?\n\n12:38.000 --> 12:40.000\nSame way on both counts.\n\n12:40.000 --> 12:42.000\nJust, you know what?\n\n12:42.000 --> 12:46.000\nAs politically unfashionable as it is right now,\n\n12:46.000 --> 12:47.000\nI'll just go ahead and say it\n\n12:47.000 --> 12:49.000\nbecause I'm being asked the question.\n\n12:49.000 --> 12:53.000\nAnomalous clitoris?\n\n12:53.000 --> 12:55.000\nAll right, give me a beat.\n\n12:55.000 --> 12:57.000\nYo.\n\n12:57.000 --> 12:58.000\nZach, put it...\n\n12:58.000 --> 13:02.000\nI got high hopes for this one.\n\n13:02.000 --> 13:04.000\nYo.\n\n13:04.000 --> 13:05.000\nYo.\n\n13:05.000 --> 13:07.000\nRight about now,\n\n13:07.000 --> 13:10.000\nit's time for Anomalous Clitoris.\n\n13:10.000 --> 13:12.000\nBring him to the stage.\n\n13:12.000 --> 13:15.000\nHello?\n\n13:15.000 --> 13:18.000\nHello?\n\n13:18.000 --> 13:20.000\nI'm Anomalous Clitoris.\n\n13:20.000 --> 13:26.000\nI'm here to say I'm making a big scene today.\n\n13:26.000 --> 13:30.000\nI'm a new kind of rapper that you've never seen.\n\n13:30.000 --> 13:33.000\nAnomalous Clitoris is not where you've been\n\n13:33.000 --> 13:35.000\nand if you don't like things that are new\n\n13:35.000 --> 13:37.000\nthen you need to step aside\n\n13:37.000 --> 13:39.000\nbecause the world's getting smaller\n\n13:39.000 --> 13:41.000\nand the clitoris is getting wide.\n\n13:41.000 --> 13:44.000\nAnomalous, a clitoris,\n\n13:44.000 --> 13:48.000\nit's not the clitoris that you can predict,\n\n13:48.000 --> 13:53.000\nbut that's why the price of this is...\n\n13:58.000 --> 14:00.000\nThank you.\n\n14:00.000 --> 14:02.000\nI just felt like Anomalous Clitoris\n\n14:02.000 --> 14:07.000\nis a good 2018 rap name.\n\n14:10.000 --> 14:13.000\nI still can't find Balder Dash cards.\n\n14:13.000 --> 14:18.000\nI was looking for weeks.\n\n14:18.000 --> 14:23.000\nYou know, if you did want\n\n14:23.000 --> 14:27.000\nrap to be good,\n\n14:27.000 --> 14:30.000\nthere's a person in the empty warehouse\n\n14:30.000 --> 14:32.000\nthat's just visiting\n\n14:32.000 --> 14:37.000\nwho you played their rap a couple of episodes ago.\n\n14:37.000 --> 14:39.000\nAre you talking about Rob Tanchum?\n\n14:39.000 --> 14:42.000\nHe did the Fuck Your Mama rap\n\n14:42.000 --> 14:45.000\nthat we kind of applauded.\n\n14:45.000 --> 14:47.000\nYeah, it's a big hit.\n\n14:47.000 --> 14:49.000\nAnd he came out and he visited.\n\n14:49.000 --> 14:51.000\nI don't want to spoil too much,\n\n14:51.000 --> 14:53.000\nbut we laid down some tracks with him.\n\n14:53.000 --> 14:55.000\nWe don't know what we're doing.\n\n14:55.000 --> 14:57.000\nCan we say what those tracks are?\n\n14:57.000 --> 14:59.000\nShould we keep those a secret?\n\n14:59.000 --> 15:01.000\nIt seemed like it's so important.\n\n15:01.000 --> 15:03.000\nI just would say...\n\n15:03.000 --> 15:06.000\nI don't think it blows it to say...\n\n15:06.000 --> 15:11.000\nhe felt the need or the compulsion\n\n15:11.000 --> 15:15.000\nto write a Pringles Dick rap.\n\n15:15.000 --> 15:17.000\nYeah, well, he's kind of a...\n\n15:17.000 --> 15:19.000\nhe's a really good rap writer.\n\n15:19.000 --> 15:22.000\nAnd he wrote a giraffe rap that knocks my socks off.\n\n15:22.000 --> 15:25.000\nAnd it was on assignment,\n\n15:25.000 --> 15:28.000\nwhich I don't respond well to people going,\n\n15:28.000 --> 15:30.000\nlike, well, why don't you make it about this?\n\n15:30.000 --> 15:33.000\nBut he was in town,\n\n15:33.000 --> 15:36.000\nand I was doing a different thing.\n\n15:36.000 --> 15:39.000\nWe're going to be putting out a little tape.\n\n15:39.000 --> 15:41.000\nThat's a tease.\n\n15:41.000 --> 15:43.000\nI'll tease it that much.\n\n15:43.000 --> 15:48.000\nAnd so I had said to Mr. Tangem,\n\n15:48.000 --> 15:50.000\nwho's visiting,\n\n15:50.000 --> 15:53.000\nif you did have any kind of\n\n15:53.000 --> 15:57.000\nlyrical thoughts about giraffes,\n\n15:57.000 --> 15:59.000\nlove them, hate them,\n\n15:59.000 --> 16:01.000\nmaybe you are a giraffe,\n\n16:01.000 --> 16:05.000\nthen you're like, we could maybe slide you into this\n\n16:05.000 --> 16:07.000\nother stupid thing that I'm doing.\n\n16:07.000 --> 16:09.000\nWhat I'm doing is not that brilliant.\n\n16:09.000 --> 16:12.000\nIt's just for fans of the podcast.\n\n16:12.000 --> 16:14.000\nIt might be a little treat.\n\n16:14.000 --> 16:15.000\nShould we bring him up?\n\n16:15.000 --> 16:18.000\nLet's bring Rob Tanchum up.\n\n16:18.000 --> 16:29.000\nRob Tanchum to the stage, please.\n\n16:29.000 --> 16:31.000\nEverybody, meet Rob.\n\n16:31.000 --> 16:34.000\nHello, Rob.\n\n16:34.000 --> 16:37.000\nSo like a consummate rapper, Dan,\n\n16:37.000 --> 16:40.000\nyou've developed a crew that you now roll with,\n\n16:40.000 --> 16:42.000\nand he's in it, right? Is that correct?\n\n16:42.000 --> 16:44.000\nI guess he's part of your crew.\n\n16:44.000 --> 16:45.000\nYou're rolling deep.\n\n16:45.000 --> 16:46.000\nWould you say you have a posse now?\n\n16:46.000 --> 16:48.000\nI don't know. It's hard to say,\n\n16:48.000 --> 16:50.000\nbecause I don't know that what I do is really,\n\n16:50.000 --> 16:53.000\nI'm kind of a performance artist still, I think.\n\n16:53.000 --> 16:56.000\nI haven't taken pen to paper ever.\n\n16:56.000 --> 17:01.000\nRob went back to where he's staying.\n\n17:01.000 --> 17:02.000\nI wanted to say hotel,\n\n17:02.000 --> 17:03.000\nbut that's factually inaccurate.\n\n17:03.000 --> 17:05.000\nYou're staying with a friend.\n\n17:05.000 --> 17:10.000\nBut that's the time frame.\n\n17:10.000 --> 17:12.000\nOn day one of his visit,\n\n17:12.000 --> 17:16.000\nI was like, why don't you, if you want to write\n\n17:16.000 --> 17:20.000\nlike a giraffe verse,\n\n17:20.000 --> 17:22.000\nmaybe we can record that tomorrow,\n\n17:22.000 --> 17:24.000\nbecause we'll both be in the studio.\n\n17:24.000 --> 17:26.000\nAnd then he went home and then he came back\n\n17:26.000 --> 17:30.000\nand he had all kinds of shit, including this,\n\n17:30.000 --> 17:33.000\nand we did record it,\n\n17:33.000 --> 17:36.000\nbut I thought it would be, since we have the beat,\n\n17:36.000 --> 17:38.000\ndo we have the beat?\n\n17:38.000 --> 17:41.000\nIf you're prepared to wrap it,\n\n17:41.000 --> 17:46.000\nsince, why not offset my particularly bad evening\n\n17:46.000 --> 17:48.000\nfor me freestyle-wise with, look,\n\n17:48.000 --> 17:50.000\nif good rap is what you want.\n\n17:50.000 --> 17:52.000\nI think you're being too hard on yourself, Dan.\n\n17:52.000 --> 17:54.000\nI think because we don't have the live audience here,\n\n17:54.000 --> 17:57.000\nyou don't get that feedback from...\n\n17:57.000 --> 17:59.000\nI think the people right now\n\n17:59.000 --> 18:01.000\nare shouting at their laptops.\n\n18:01.000 --> 18:02.000\nThat's not true.\n\n18:02.000 --> 18:05.000\nSome of his best rapping has been recently.\n\n18:05.000 --> 18:07.000\nBut this wasn't it?\n\n18:07.000 --> 18:10.000\nThis wasn't bad, but certainly not the heights.\n\n18:10.000 --> 18:12.000\nIt's video games, I think,\n\n18:12.000 --> 18:16.000\nfry the part of your brain that you used to rap, kids.\n\n18:16.000 --> 18:17.000\nI'm not a doctor.\n\n18:17.000 --> 18:18.000\nI don't play video games.\n\n18:18.000 --> 18:19.000\nDon't play video games.\n\n18:19.000 --> 18:20.000\nThat's your secret.\n\n18:20.000 --> 18:21.000\nThat's your secret.\n\n18:21.000 --> 18:22.000\nBut you also don't really freestyle.\n\n18:22.000 --> 18:23.000\nI mean, we don't...\n\n18:23.000 --> 18:25.000\nI mean, it's not your...\n\n18:25.000 --> 18:28.000\nNo, I practiced earlier in case, you know,\n\n18:28.000 --> 18:30.000\nthere was a need to freestyle.\n\n18:30.000 --> 18:32.000\nI wanted to, like, exercise that muscle beforehand,\n\n18:32.000 --> 18:33.000\nbecause we never got to...\n\n18:33.000 --> 18:34.000\nLet's do that, then.\n\n18:34.000 --> 18:35.000\nWell, let's do it.\n\n18:35.000 --> 18:37.000\nBecause we talked about trading fours,\n\n18:37.000 --> 18:40.000\nbecause we were in the booth at the same time.\n\n18:40.000 --> 18:43.000\nWe did an improv, but we never freestyle together.\n\n18:43.000 --> 18:44.000\nSo I was just ready for it.\n\n18:44.000 --> 18:46.000\nI don't want to, you know...\n\n18:46.000 --> 18:47.000\nI think that...\n\n18:47.000 --> 18:50.000\nI'd like the kids to hear your giraffe rap, I think.\n\n18:50.000 --> 18:51.000\nYeah.\n\n18:51.000 --> 18:53.000\nWould you do the same thing that you did?\n\n18:53.000 --> 18:54.000\nZach, you got that beat?\n\n18:54.000 --> 18:55.000\nNo.\n\n18:55.000 --> 18:57.000\nI'm not going to, because I don't want to step on it.\n\n18:57.000 --> 18:58.000\nI just want people to listen.\n\n18:58.000 --> 19:00.000\nAnd you don't worry about performance.\n\n19:00.000 --> 19:04.000\nJust eat the mic and make sure they hear your delicious lyrics\n\n19:04.000 --> 19:07.000\nthat you wrote overnight having been assigned\n\n19:07.000 --> 19:10.000\nthe task of writing about giraffes.\n\n19:10.000 --> 19:14.000\nYeah, because Dan has a long, weird relationship with...\n\n19:14.000 --> 19:17.000\nI would say love hate, but just hate hate on giraffes.\n\n19:17.000 --> 19:18.000\nNo, I hate giraffes.\n\n19:18.000 --> 19:19.000\nYou hate giraffes.\n\n19:19.000 --> 19:20.000\nYeah.\n\n19:20.000 --> 19:21.000\nCan I adopt that for this one?\n\n19:21.000 --> 19:22.000\nYeah.\n\n19:22.000 --> 19:26.000\nWell, because there's an existing track of you doing...\n\n19:26.000 --> 19:27.000\nA giraffe rap.\n\n19:27.000 --> 19:28.000\nGiraffe rap.\n\n19:28.000 --> 19:31.000\nWell, I don't want to ruin your giraffe rap, eating a leaf.\n\n19:31.000 --> 19:32.000\nYeah.\n\n19:32.000 --> 19:34.000\nYou know, reaching real high to get up to my tree.\n\n19:34.000 --> 19:35.000\nYeah.\n\n19:35.000 --> 19:36.000\nYou can listen to it in the archives.\n\n19:36.000 --> 19:39.000\nYeah, and it's actually one of the more awkward freestyles\n\n19:39.000 --> 19:42.000\nI've ever done, because I rhymed Darwin with hard win.\n\n19:42.000 --> 19:43.000\nThat's great.\n\n19:43.000 --> 19:44.000\nWhich is very funny.\n\n19:44.000 --> 19:45.000\nAnd you could have said Harmon.\n\n19:45.000 --> 19:46.000\nHarmon, yeah.\n\n19:46.000 --> 19:47.000\nI could have said Harmon.\n\n19:47.000 --> 19:51.000\nYou could have said...\n\n19:51.000 --> 19:53.000\nDid you just shit your pants?\n\n19:53.000 --> 19:56.000\nNo, I committed to not finishing the sentence.\n\n19:56.000 --> 20:02.000\nAll right, well, let's just at you when you feel ready.\n\n20:02.000 --> 20:03.000\nNow, how about this?\n\n20:03.000 --> 20:04.000\nCan I make a picture?\n\n20:04.000 --> 20:06.000\nBecause you're going to do your rap.\n\n20:06.000 --> 20:07.000\nSure.\n\n20:07.000 --> 20:13.000\nWhen it's done, like when your rap is through, Dan, why don't you go into some extemporaneous\n\n20:13.000 --> 20:14.000\nfreestyle giraffe?\n\n20:14.000 --> 20:17.000\nWell, I'll tell you the answer is because obviously, as we've established, I'm not really on my\n\n20:17.000 --> 20:18.000\ngame tonight.\n\n20:18.000 --> 20:19.000\nWell, so...\n\n20:19.000 --> 20:23.000\nLook, I'm not saying that if you do a bad job, the show is going to end.\n\n20:23.000 --> 20:24.000\nOkay, but let's just...\n\n20:24.000 --> 20:25.000\nI'm giving you an opportunity.\n\n20:25.000 --> 20:29.000\nLet's just do the thing we said we were going to do.\n\n20:29.000 --> 20:30.000\nWell, let's simplify it.\n\n20:30.000 --> 20:32.000\nInstead of data, you can rap about clitoris.\n\n20:32.000 --> 20:33.000\nOkay.\n\n20:33.000 --> 20:34.000\nYes.\n\n20:34.000 --> 20:35.000\nAnd a Russian accent.\n\n20:35.000 --> 20:36.000\nOkay.\n\n20:36.000 --> 20:37.000\nIt's going to be great.\n\n20:37.000 --> 20:38.400\nAs long as we just keep pimping me, it'll become a great show.\n\n20:38.400 --> 20:40.000\nI will become talented.\n\n20:40.000 --> 20:41.000\nHe's working.\n\n20:41.000 --> 20:42.000\nI will become enthusiastic.\n\n20:42.000 --> 20:48.000\nMy brain chemistry will completely change if we just keep making me do stuff.\n\n20:48.000 --> 20:49.000\nAll right.\n\n20:49.000 --> 20:50.000\nI agree.\n\n20:50.000 --> 20:51.000\nLet's...\n\n20:51.000 --> 20:57.000\nWhen you're ready, you cue him, and then let's listen to this.\n\n20:57.000 --> 20:58.000\nYo.\n\n20:58.000 --> 21:02.000\nAnd then in the track, there's a lot of...\n\n21:02.000 --> 21:03.000\nRob Tanchum.\n\n21:03.000 --> 21:05.000\nThat's very exciting to me.\n\n21:05.000 --> 21:06.000\nOkay.\n\n21:06.000 --> 21:07.000\nYo.\n\n21:07.000 --> 21:08.000\nYeah.\n\n21:08.000 --> 21:09.000\nGiraffe rap.\n\n21:09.000 --> 21:10.000\nRapping giraffe facts.\n\n21:10.000 --> 21:11.000\nInterested in info on giraffes?\n\n21:11.000 --> 21:12.000\nWell, I have that.\n\n21:12.000 --> 21:13.000\nFuck what you heard.\n\n21:13.000 --> 21:14.000\nDrafts are the worst.\n\n21:14.000 --> 21:17.000\nHopefully one day they will be purged from the earth.\n\n21:17.000 --> 21:20.000\nNo one's ever seen a giraffe go swimming.\n\n21:20.000 --> 21:21.000\nIt's a legitimate draft fact.\n\n21:21.000 --> 21:22.000\nNo kidding.\n\n21:22.000 --> 21:24.000\nIf you chew a bath, the giraffe won't get it.\n\n21:24.000 --> 21:27.000\nAnd bunch of tall assholes don't know what they're missing.\n\n21:27.000 --> 21:29.000\nTend a whole goddamn day eating leaves.\n\n21:29.000 --> 21:32.000\n80 pounds worth to fulfill the dietary needs.\n\n21:32.000 --> 21:33.000\nNo time for hobbies.\n\n21:33.000 --> 21:34.000\nNo skis or trophies.\n\n21:34.000 --> 21:35.000\nNo leisurely evenings.\n\n21:35.000 --> 21:36.000\nNo reason to be.\n\n21:36.000 --> 21:37.000\nBarely even sleep.\n\n21:37.000 --> 21:38.000\nTen minute intervals.\n\n21:38.000 --> 21:39.000\nStanding straight up.\n\n21:39.000 --> 21:40.000\nStraight up imbeciles.\n\n21:40.000 --> 21:41.000\nOnly vertebrate species that can't gong.\n\n21:41.000 --> 21:42.000\nWhen they're all gone, I'm a feel invincible.\n\n21:42.000 --> 21:43.000\nDrink water once every few days.\n\n21:43.000 --> 21:53.000\nLearning draft facts fills my veins with rage.\n\n21:53.000 --> 21:54.000\nThey're not like me.\n\n21:54.000 --> 21:55.000\nI don't like that.\n\n21:55.000 --> 21:56.000\nDrafts aren't human.\n\n21:56.000 --> 21:58.000\nDrafts can't write drafts.\n\n21:58.000 --> 21:59.000\nDrafts make no sound.\n\n21:59.000 --> 22:02.000\nNot because they can, but because they choose not to.\n\n22:02.000 --> 22:03.000\nWhat?\n\n22:03.000 --> 22:04.000\nThat's a fact I found.\n\n22:04.000 --> 22:05.000\nFuck a smug herbivores.\n\n22:05.000 --> 22:07.000\nIf I could, I would fight you.\n\n22:07.000 --> 22:08.000\nFuck giraffes.\n\n22:08.000 --> 22:09.000\nAll right.\n\n22:09.000 --> 22:10.000\nThank you.\n\n22:10.000 --> 22:13.000\nBig clitorises.\n\n22:13.000 --> 22:15.000\nAnomalous clitoris.\n\n22:15.000 --> 22:17.000\nTake it over.\n\n22:17.000 --> 22:21.000\nIf you see a horse with a very long neck.\n\n22:21.000 --> 22:23.000\nAnomalous clitoris is now on deck.\n\n22:23.000 --> 22:25.000\nI'm a zookeeper of science.\n\n22:25.000 --> 22:32.000\nI drop it mad and I don't know why it's so hard to have a foot this big.\n\n22:32.000 --> 22:33.000\nCheck out my rig.\n\n22:33.000 --> 22:36.000\nIt's an 18 wheel truck.\n\n22:36.000 --> 22:38.000\nAnomalous clitoris is hard to fuck.\n\n22:38.000 --> 22:45.000\nYou don't know where to put your wiener when the clitoris is far less leaner.\n\n22:45.000 --> 22:46.000\nCan we stop?\n\n22:46.000 --> 22:48.000\nI was just making the joke.\n\n22:48.000 --> 22:53.000\nIt's just not the right time in our nation's history.\n\n22:53.000 --> 22:55.000\nIt's not the right time.\n\n22:55.000 --> 22:58.000\nYou really ran with it more than I expected.\n\n22:58.000 --> 23:01.000\nYou're a real sport and that should be commended.\n\n23:01.000 --> 23:02.000\nYeah.\n\n23:02.000 --> 23:03.000\nHow about those shirts?\n\n23:03.000 --> 23:07.000\nAre you saying that it's a real giraffe fact that giraffes can make sounds but they\n\n23:07.000 --> 23:08.000\nchoose not to?\n\n23:08.000 --> 23:09.000\nThis is the phrasing of it.\n\n23:09.000 --> 23:12.000\nGiraffes don't make sounds.\n\n23:12.000 --> 23:18.000\nI did a Google perusing but giraffes don't make sounds.\n\n23:18.000 --> 23:21.000\nNot because they can't but because they choose not to.\n\n23:21.000 --> 23:23.000\nIt's infuriating.\n\n23:23.000 --> 23:25.000\nThey have the capacity to make.\n\n23:25.000 --> 23:27.000\nThey have vocal cords that could make a sound.\n\n23:27.000 --> 23:31.000\nI guess according to discovery kids or discovery adults or whatever fact.\n\n23:31.000 --> 23:35.000\nI go to discovery kids for all of my facts.\n\n23:35.000 --> 23:41.000\nThey have the capacity to make a noise but they're like why?\n\n23:41.000 --> 23:43.000\nI'm a fucking giraffe.\n\n23:43.000 --> 23:45.000\nWhat am I going to do?\n\n23:45.000 --> 23:47.000\nSay hey there's some leaves over here?\n\n23:47.000 --> 23:53.000\nThey have no reason to make any noise because they have to because they require, I rounded\n\n23:53.000 --> 24:00.000\nup to 80 for the lyric but it was 75 or over pounds of food a day and because they're eating\n\n24:00.000 --> 24:05.000\nleaves and their drafts they have to spend all day eating so there's nothing else.\n\n24:05.000 --> 24:06.000\nThey don't have a reason.\n\n24:06.000 --> 24:08.000\nThey can't waste those calories on talking shit.\n\n24:08.000 --> 24:10.000\nThey got to eat those leaves.\n\n24:10.000 --> 24:12.000\nI've never asked myself this question.\n\n24:12.000 --> 24:21.000\nGiraffes I'm assuming they're like in the same biomes, biomes that I'm assuming their\n\n24:21.000 --> 24:27.000\npredators are like big cats like your Puma's and your Jaguar's.\n\n24:27.000 --> 24:33.000\nPeople only fuck with the young giraffes because the big giraffes will just kung fu.\n\n24:33.000 --> 24:35.000\nThey'll kick the fuck out of you.\n\n24:35.000 --> 24:38.000\nDo you know that?\n\n24:38.000 --> 24:40.000\nThere's videos where they kick.\n\n24:40.000 --> 24:42.000\nI think giraffes will kick.\n\n24:42.000 --> 24:46.000\nSo if a tiger sees a giraffe or a lion they'll go like wow.\n\n24:46.000 --> 24:48.000\nThey don't fuck with a full grown giraffe even a pack of them.\n\n24:48.000 --> 24:50.000\nThe giraffe will A. outrun them.\n\n24:50.000 --> 24:51.000\nOutrun them?\n\n24:51.000 --> 24:52.000\nNo they're fast.\n\n24:52.000 --> 24:53.000\nThey're fastest shit.\n\n24:53.000 --> 24:56.000\nAnd if they kick you you're done.\n\n24:56.000 --> 24:58.000\nThey'll break your jaw.\n\n24:58.000 --> 24:59.000\nYou can't eat anymore.\n\n24:59.000 --> 25:02.000\nYou're a dead tiger or a dead lion rather.\n\n25:02.000 --> 25:07.000\nIf they fucking give you one karate chop with one of their hoofs you've just located\n\n25:07.000 --> 25:09.000\nsomething and you can't operate anymore.\n\n25:09.000 --> 25:12.000\nSo the big cats know not to fuck with a full grown giraffe.\n\n25:12.000 --> 25:15.000\nWell now we know why they don't choose to make sounds.\n\n25:15.000 --> 25:20.000\nI mean they're like the Winston Churchill's of their bodies made of big sticks.\n\n25:20.000 --> 25:21.000\nRight.\n\n25:21.000 --> 25:26.000\nWell if the body was made of big sticks.\n\n25:26.000 --> 25:29.000\nThey would speak even more than softly.\n\n25:29.000 --> 25:32.000\nOr would they be allowed to speak more softly because they're just one.\n\n25:32.000 --> 25:33.000\nThey're always carrying.\n\n25:33.000 --> 25:34.000\nThere's four giants.\n\n25:34.000 --> 25:35.000\nOh have you seen them fight?\n\n25:35.000 --> 25:41.000\nThe rest of the Churchill put it says speak softly carry a big stick and it's dot dot dot.\n\n25:41.000 --> 25:44.000\nAnd if your body's made of giant sticks don't speak at all.\n\n25:44.000 --> 25:46.000\nHave you seen them fucking fight each other?\n\n25:46.000 --> 25:47.000\nThey just go like.\n\n25:47.000 --> 25:48.000\nThey wank.\n\n25:48.000 --> 25:49.000\nIt's called necking.\n\n25:49.000 --> 25:51.000\nIt's crazy.\n\n25:51.000 --> 25:52.000\nThey club each other.\n\n25:52.000 --> 25:55.000\nAnd Churchill I think you pointed out to me that they have the same amount of vertebrae.\n\n25:55.000 --> 25:56.000\nThey have the same.\n\n25:56.000 --> 25:57.000\nThey have seven vertebrae.\n\n25:57.000 --> 25:58.000\nThey're just.\n\n25:58.000 --> 25:59.000\nIn their necks.\n\n25:59.000 --> 26:02.000\nThey're just long ass vertebrae.\n\n26:02.000 --> 26:04.000\nThey're like extravert.\n\n26:04.000 --> 26:07.000\nExtravertebrae.\n\n26:07.000 --> 26:10.000\nIf Schrab was here he'd launch a whole comic book.\n\n26:10.000 --> 26:13.000\nExtravertebrae.\n\n26:13.000 --> 26:17.000\nThere's a giraffe with eight vertebrae in his neck and like dies.\n\n26:17.000 --> 26:23.000\nNot to remove the joy from my hatred of giraffes which is just you know like it's because it's\n\n26:23.000 --> 26:28.000\nobviously it's like that's the thing that we learn about in evolution is like that's\n\n26:28.000 --> 26:32.000\nthat's an illustration of Darwinian evolution is that you slowly get along your neck.\n\n26:32.000 --> 26:39.000\nAnd it's like not how humans roll like we didn't we didn't our bodies didn't morph to\n\n26:39.000 --> 26:40.000\nsuit our surroundings.\n\n26:40.000 --> 26:45.000\nWe we became we became hackers of the environment.\n\n26:45.000 --> 26:50.000\nMaybe trees I mean maybe trees got taller because of other animals like the trees and\n\n26:50.000 --> 26:51.000\nthe giraffes were meeting each other.\n\n26:51.000 --> 26:56.000\nThat's just one reason why you don't want to go the long neck root.\n\n26:56.000 --> 27:00.000\nI like like don't don't play footsie with Mother Earth.\n\n27:00.000 --> 27:03.000\nLike fucking get down to roll up your sleeves.\n\n27:03.000 --> 27:11.000\nShe's been trying to kill you for fucking eight billion years man fucking take a piece.\n\n27:11.000 --> 27:13.000\nI'm not a conservative.\n\n27:13.000 --> 27:14.000\nI'm not saying drill baby drill.\n\n27:14.000 --> 27:17.000\nWho do you think is the most efficient animal in the animal kingdom.\n\n27:17.000 --> 27:20.000\nYou're obviously not giraffes but who is the most efficient animal.\n\n27:20.000 --> 27:24.000\nWho is the most Darwinian efficient design.\n\n27:24.000 --> 27:28.000\nWell I'm supposed to say cockroach because they survived the nuclear whatever but but\n\n27:28.000 --> 27:32.000\nI mean forgetting about that nuclear holocaust thing which I don't know how much of that\n\n27:32.000 --> 27:35.000\nis apocryphal or whatever you call it.\n\n27:35.000 --> 27:42.000\nI feel like ants are yeah because they they're they're basically dirt that moves.\n\n27:42.000 --> 27:56.000\nThey they they've combined individual life form and colony and and and and yes through\n\n27:56.000 --> 28:09.000\nthe colonial technique like they it doesn't matter if one of them dies and yet they just\n\n28:09.000 --> 28:12.000\ndon't know it's it's kind of amazing what they do those little guys.\n\n28:12.000 --> 28:16.000\nThat's an interesting answer in comparison to drafts because one of the draft facts that\n\n28:16.000 --> 28:22.000\nI learned is that they have no societal hierarchy or structure or anything.\n\n28:22.000 --> 28:23.000\nThey're the opposite of ants.\n\n28:23.000 --> 28:26.000\nThey're just they're they're they're free form.\n\n28:26.000 --> 28:27.000\nOh man.\n\n28:27.000 --> 28:31.000\nI knew this was going to happen if we start if I actually ever researched drafts I knew\n\n28:31.000 --> 28:33.000\nI would fall in love with them.\n\n28:33.000 --> 28:38.000\nI have I have one big one that they sound like the dolphin of the desert.\n\n28:38.000 --> 28:44.000\nI think that I think that's what I can't.\n\n28:44.000 --> 28:46.000\nI didn't want to episode title.\n\n28:46.000 --> 28:53.000\nIt didn't make it into the rap but there's a very interesting one was that before mating\n\n28:53.000 --> 28:57.000\na female giraffe will urinate into the male drafts mouth.\n\n28:57.000 --> 28:58.000\nHow does he get down there?\n\n28:58.000 --> 28:59.000\nI don't know.\n\n28:59.000 --> 29:00.000\nI don't know.\n\n29:00.000 --> 29:01.000\nIt's got a long neck.\n\n29:01.000 --> 29:04.000\nWell because they're all these things where they can't reach the ground.\n\n29:04.000 --> 29:05.000\nThey can't really sit.\n\n29:05.000 --> 29:08.000\nBut that's that's part of it and I didn't want to I didn't want to bring it in into\n\n29:08.000 --> 29:09.000\na negative context.\n\n29:09.000 --> 29:12.000\nThe female giraffe peas in the male drafts mouth.\n\n29:12.000 --> 29:13.000\nYeah.\n\n29:13.000 --> 29:14.000\nAnd that's courtship.\n\n29:14.000 --> 29:15.000\nOh yeah.\n\n29:15.000 --> 29:16.000\nYeah baby.\n\n29:16.000 --> 29:21.000\nYeah I think it's to taste fertility taste fertile giraffes taste fertility.\n\n29:21.000 --> 29:25.000\nShe said she said welcome to flavor country.\n\n29:25.000 --> 29:29.000\nShe's saying I'm ready.\n\n29:29.000 --> 29:34.000\nLet me pee in your mouth and taste whether or not you want to fuck me.\n\n29:34.000 --> 29:37.000\nI mean that definitely is like the opposite of ants.\n\n29:37.000 --> 29:38.000\nRight.\n\n29:38.000 --> 29:40.000\nBecause it's like there's no there's no power dynamic there.\n\n29:40.000 --> 29:44.000\nI mean we think well whoever's getting their mouth peed in is on bottom.\n\n29:44.000 --> 29:48.000\nBut I mean first of all these are giraffes.\n\n29:48.000 --> 29:49.000\nNo one's on bottom.\n\n29:49.000 --> 29:50.000\nThere's no bottom.\n\n29:50.000 --> 29:53.000\nThey get their heads like in the clouds.\n\n29:53.000 --> 29:58.000\nBut but but it's also like like wait so she it's it's it's the down and drinks for\n\n29:58.000 --> 29:59.000\npee.\n\n29:59.000 --> 30:00.000\nI didn't see a diagram.\n\n30:00.000 --> 30:01.000\nI didn't see any type of pill.\n\n30:01.000 --> 30:03.000\nDoes she pee in a puddle and he laps up the puddle.\n\n30:03.000 --> 30:06.000\nYeah she pees in a puddle and he laps it up for real.\n\n30:06.000 --> 30:09.000\nNo that's stupid.\n\n30:09.000 --> 30:14.000\nI'm assuming that she said she jet that it jets like it goes up.\n\n30:14.000 --> 30:17.000\nHe doesn't even bend down that it's like what's like a ping pong.\n\n30:17.000 --> 30:18.000\nIt goes that far up.\n\n30:18.000 --> 30:20.000\nShe can shoot pee in the air.\n\n30:20.000 --> 30:22.000\nWell what I love about that is it's all voluntary.\n\n30:22.000 --> 30:23.000\nEverything has agency.\n\n30:23.000 --> 30:25.000\nEvery the guy the girl.\n\n30:25.000 --> 30:28.000\nShe's just like yeah don't mind me.\n\n30:28.000 --> 30:32.000\nBut if anyone's interested like like like check out what's for sale.\n\n30:32.000 --> 30:35.000\nLook I choose not to talk.\n\n30:35.000 --> 30:38.000\nI'm not a man with words.\n\n30:38.000 --> 30:42.000\nI you know like let's just simplify things pee in my mouth.\n\n30:42.000 --> 30:44.000\nLet me taste whether or not.\n\n30:44.000 --> 30:48.000\nAnd then you can like wander by and like take a slurp like it's from in Milwaukee what\n\n30:48.000 --> 30:53.000\nwe call a bubbler and and you sip it and then you go like good morning Margaret and\n\n30:53.000 --> 30:56.000\nthen you just keep walking like she's not offended.\n\n30:56.000 --> 30:58.000\nYou know like if you're not into it.\n\n30:58.000 --> 31:03.000\nIf you're like you know what I I'm going to if I was a female giraffe and peed in some\n\n31:03.000 --> 31:08.000\nbut some gentleman's mouth and he just walked by I'd be very offended.\n\n31:08.000 --> 31:12.000\nI would say well what's my peas not good enough for you.\n\n31:12.000 --> 31:14.000\nWell how do you go back and get nervous.\n\n31:14.000 --> 31:18.000\nI would leave the room and like I would pee in the mouth because I walked in on you peeing.\n\n31:18.000 --> 31:19.000\nYou did.\n\n31:19.000 --> 31:24.000\nYou did and I did get I admitted to you being a peeshaw and I stopped peeing.\n\n31:24.000 --> 31:30.000\nI was I he was already peeing in the urinal at star burns I went into the stall the stall.\n\n31:30.000 --> 31:31.000\nYeah.\n\n31:31.000 --> 31:35.000\nPeed came out and you were kind of like and you but you walked in you said excited to\n\n31:35.000 --> 31:36.000\nhear that giraffe rap.\n\n31:36.000 --> 31:41.000\nYeah I said I said hello how do you do I thought you were either mid or post pee.\n\n31:41.000 --> 31:46.000\nAnd then I was washing my hands and you were bravely admitted.\n\n31:46.000 --> 31:50.000\nI did that thing where I didn't pee because you scared me when you walked in.\n\n31:50.000 --> 31:58.000\nHere's what I like about the pee tasting design sexually as a courtship ritual.\n\n31:58.000 --> 32:02.000\nThere is no I'm saying like it's happening behind her.\n\n32:02.000 --> 32:06.000\nShe's peeing it's she's she's facing this way.\n\n32:06.000 --> 32:12.000\nSo is it you just pee and then whoever's behind you just takes it takes a taste like\n\n32:12.000 --> 32:14.000\nthey're at a wine party.\n\n32:14.000 --> 32:17.000\nYou think the guy sneak attack pee tasting or is she peeing.\n\n32:17.000 --> 32:20.000\nShe said hey come over here I want to pee in your mouth.\n\n32:20.000 --> 32:21.000\nWell I don't.\n\n32:21.000 --> 32:22.000\nThis is.\n\n32:22.000 --> 32:27.000\nI'm picturing a jet of pee so I don't think I'd be surprised.\n\n32:27.000 --> 32:30.000\nHe said the female peas in the male's mouth.\n\n32:30.000 --> 32:31.000\nWe all thought the same thing.\n\n32:31.000 --> 32:34.000\nHow is that even physically possible they're giraffes.\n\n32:34.000 --> 32:39.000\nSo then I went to well maybe it's like a jet coming out of her nether is like going arcing\n\n32:39.000 --> 32:44.000\ninto the air and then it made me think of like a garden hose like at a fun party where\n\n32:44.000 --> 32:45.000\nlike it doesn't matter.\n\n32:45.000 --> 32:50.000\nThere's enough for everyone and like and that and that and that that way like there could\n\n32:50.000 --> 32:56.000\nbe like several males like walking by and they just like take a nibble you know of it.\n\n32:56.000 --> 33:00.000\nLike maybe that's just say let's say I'm designing a perfect species here.\n\n33:00.000 --> 33:02.000\nI'm not I don't know what giraffes do.\n\n33:02.000 --> 33:10.000\nWe're almost there like like like the woman peas in a in a giant arc and if you don't\n\n33:10.000 --> 33:13.000\nwant to get peed on you don't go near there.\n\n33:13.000 --> 33:19.000\nYeah but also I don't think in this species culture there's a lot of P phobia but but\n\n33:19.000 --> 33:26.000\nbut you if you're in the vicinity of a woman who's peeing you you walk through it like\n\n33:26.000 --> 33:27.000\na sprinkler.\n\n33:27.000 --> 33:32.000\nYou can pretend you didn't taste anything that's not offensive to her.\n\n33:32.000 --> 33:38.000\nYou just walk through it and go tap of the morning Sheila and but if it's you know if\n\n33:38.000 --> 33:45.000\nyou if you get something on your tongue that's like she's she is like dropping a thousand\n\n33:45.000 --> 33:46.000\neggs today.\n\n33:46.000 --> 33:49.000\nI don't know how you measure fertility.\n\n33:49.000 --> 33:57.000\nShe is fecund and then and then and you're like you know and I'm kind of I'm a little\n\n33:57.000 --> 34:05.000\nriled up myself truth be told and then you circle around and you say Sheila you're you're\n\n34:05.000 --> 34:08.000\npositively glowing today.\n\n34:08.000 --> 34:10.000\nYour urine is on my face.\n\n34:10.000 --> 34:16.000\nIt tastes like you're you'd make a baby giraffe without me.\n\n34:16.000 --> 34:18.000\nWant to make one with me.\n\n34:18.000 --> 34:23.000\nI'm assuming then she goes she can say yes or no and it's just like it's checks and balances\n\n34:23.000 --> 34:29.000\nyou know we wouldn't have any of these problems and then if if if if he is just perfecting\n\n34:29.000 --> 34:35.000\nthe species if she rebukes him she's like I'd rather be with Stanley than you Donald.\n\n34:35.000 --> 34:43.000\nThe guy could go all right and he can block her exit and jerk off into a potted plant.\n\n34:43.000 --> 34:45.000\nThat's the perfect species.\n\n34:45.000 --> 34:48.000\nJust to just to psychologically torture her and then we're done perfect.\n\n34:48.000 --> 34:49.000\nI'm kidding.\n\n34:49.000 --> 34:51.000\nJesus Christ.\n\n34:51.000 --> 34:54.000\nEverybody's laughing at every other dumb fucking thing.\n\n34:54.000 --> 34:55.000\nI'm sorry.\n\n34:55.000 --> 34:57.000\nI looked it up.\n\n34:57.000 --> 34:59.000\nIt's definitely an act.\n\n34:59.000 --> 35:02.000\nIt's not like a but there's a picture.\n\n35:02.000 --> 35:09.000\nThere's a church has footage of giraffes being on people.\n\n35:09.000 --> 35:12.000\nLike a bubbler.\n\n35:12.000 --> 35:15.000\nThat almost looks like a giraffe drinking its own pee.\n\n35:15.000 --> 35:20.000\nHow bendy are those necks?\n\n35:20.000 --> 35:21.000\nIt's like they're drinking.\n\n35:21.000 --> 35:23.000\nIt's got to be so tired.\n\n35:23.000 --> 35:28.000\nIt's like in the Lion King where everyone's around the watering hole and all the different\n\n35:28.000 --> 35:33.000\nyou know and then there's the drafts and they bend down and drink out of the communal just\n\n35:33.000 --> 35:34.000\nthey bend down.\n\n35:34.000 --> 35:35.000\nI haven't seen it.\n\n35:35.000 --> 35:36.000\nLion King.\n\n35:36.000 --> 35:38.000\nThat's the main part of it.\n\n35:38.000 --> 35:39.000\nLion King.\n\n35:39.000 --> 35:40.000\nIt's mostly about giraffes.\n\n35:40.000 --> 35:45.000\nSo a giraffe sees a male giraffe sees a female giraffe taking a pee.\n\n35:45.000 --> 35:49.000\nNo it's it's a it's a it's a it's a ritual.\n\n35:49.000 --> 35:50.000\nIt's a ritual.\n\n35:50.000 --> 35:51.000\nIt's like rubbing a neck.\n\n35:51.000 --> 35:57.000\nSo when they're courting she's like all right hey do yourself a favor get get around here\n\n35:57.000 --> 36:00.000\nget around the back end of this action.\n\n36:00.000 --> 36:03.000\nWhat the fuck can pee on you.\n\n36:03.000 --> 36:09.000\nEvery other species is like it's like somebody's just you know like like somebody's just you\n\n36:09.000 --> 36:11.000\nknow being coerced.\n\n36:11.000 --> 36:12.000\nYeah.\n\n36:12.000 --> 36:14.000\nI like sprinkler pee.\n\n36:14.000 --> 36:18.000\nSo are you on team giraffe now or I like the way they do some stuff.\n\n36:18.000 --> 36:20.000\nI like that they stomp tigers.\n\n36:20.000 --> 36:25.000\nI like that they're an herbivore that tigers are afraid of.\n\n36:25.000 --> 36:29.000\nYou know maybe the lions or maybe that long neck ain't so dumb.\n\n36:29.000 --> 36:30.000\nYeah.\n\n36:30.000 --> 36:35.000\nI mean they whack each other like they really hurt each other by just swinging their giant\n\n36:35.000 --> 36:36.000\nass head.\n\n36:36.000 --> 36:39.000\nThey're like I forgot how much they weighed.\n\n36:39.000 --> 36:42.000\nI mean that really did learn some giraffe facts.\n\n36:42.000 --> 36:45.000\nThey're those are fatal fatal blows.\n\n36:45.000 --> 36:48.000\nThey're like I'm going to say like they're 70 pound necks.\n\n36:48.000 --> 36:49.000\nThey're crazy.\n\n36:49.000 --> 36:51.000\nBut that's not the right number.\n\n36:51.000 --> 36:55.000\nBut they must get like neck problems all the time you'd think right.\n\n36:55.000 --> 36:59.000\nLike if they're whacking people with their necks like that would knock your vertebrae\n\n36:59.000 --> 37:01.000\nout of alignment you'd think.\n\n37:01.000 --> 37:02.000\nBut also they have good posture.\n\n37:02.000 --> 37:04.000\nThey're not like staring down at screens.\n\n37:04.000 --> 37:05.000\nRight.\n\n37:05.000 --> 37:07.000\nThey were for a while.\n\n37:07.000 --> 37:08.000\nRight.\n\n37:08.000 --> 37:10.000\nThey're not like in drama club.\n\n37:10.000 --> 37:14.000\nYou know they have reasons to.\n\n37:14.000 --> 37:17.000\nI'm not going to jump the shark of starting to like giraffes.\n\n37:17.000 --> 37:19.000\nBut.\n\n37:19.000 --> 37:22.000\nSo you've softened your stance on giraffes maybe a little bit.\n\n37:22.000 --> 37:26.000\nWell I just saying you respect your enemy.\n\n37:26.000 --> 37:28.000\nLike whoa.\n\n37:28.000 --> 37:33.000\nAnd I just the important thing is that you know the reason I come down on giraffes is\n\n37:33.000 --> 37:39.000\nbecause people I think there's an unspoken assumption that human beings because they\n\n37:39.000 --> 37:43.000\ndon't have long necks and they don't eat really high leaves and they don't live in the\n\n37:43.000 --> 37:48.000\ndesert they don't walk around and they don't have animal print like style like that because\n\n37:48.000 --> 37:53.000\nthat because of that like we're some kind of horrible species that like deserves to die\n\n37:53.000 --> 37:55.000\nand well we're killing the planet.\n\n37:55.000 --> 37:58.000\nCome on we're we're pretty amazing.\n\n37:58.000 --> 38:02.000\nWe're like little little monkey robots like we're great.\n\n38:02.000 --> 38:05.000\nWe we we took a different route.\n\n38:05.000 --> 38:12.000\nWe're like hey listen like what am I going to be the perfect squirrel.\n\n38:12.000 --> 38:19.000\nNo I was he become an ape and then and then like you know we represent the branch of DNA\n\n38:19.000 --> 38:24.000\nthat's like just kept just kept kept doubling down on fucking insanity.\n\n38:24.000 --> 38:27.000\nYou know just going like why don't you just fucking be Howard Hughes about it.\n\n38:27.000 --> 38:29.000\nJust show me the blueprints baby.\n\n38:29.000 --> 38:33.000\nAnd and and that's that's a proud proud legacy.\n\n38:33.000 --> 38:38.000\nWhich is stands on like like a bird like a bird bird.\n\n38:38.000 --> 38:43.000\nYeah I don't I don't I don't admire them.\n\n38:43.000 --> 38:47.000\nOh you don't know they have the gift of flight then.\n\n38:47.000 --> 38:53.000\nA gift or the free cookie of flight that was laying on the table that no one wanted to eat.\n\n38:53.000 --> 38:59.000\nEvolution they they they they they built feathers over over time they turned from lizards into\n\n38:59.000 --> 39:01.000\ninto feathered creatures that could fly.\n\n39:01.000 --> 39:03.000\nYeah but look how many birds there are.\n\n39:03.000 --> 39:09.000\nYeah like like it's so derivative like how many species like there's like five billion species of bird.\n\n39:09.000 --> 39:17.000\nRight they're all like like like like like like like you know we've tuned it out because we evolved after them\n\n39:17.000 --> 39:22.000\nso our eardrums don't bleed from listening to it but they're fucking garbage animals\n\n39:22.000 --> 39:27.000\nlike they're they're just constantly going like look out look out my name's Steve.\n\n39:27.000 --> 39:32.000\nWow wow hey over here check it out whoa whoa like like like they're they're insane.\n\n39:32.000 --> 39:39.000\nWe've become them now but but but like it's like I mean birds are just garbage.\n\n39:39.000 --> 39:45.000\nWhat about like a like a noble like owl like just lives alone hunts at night and just does his thing and his head can swivel.\n\n39:45.000 --> 39:46.000\nCrazy man.\n\n39:46.000 --> 39:53.000\nI mean predatory birds are pretty kind of interesting because they're birds but they eat fucking mammals.\n\n39:53.000 --> 39:54.000\nThat's fucking cool.\n\n39:54.000 --> 40:06.000\nThat's berserk any any any animal any species that crosses back over like like fish that eat fucking people or birds or\n\n40:06.000 --> 40:13.000\nspiders that eat like fish like like like like you gotta automatically go.\n\n40:13.000 --> 40:21.000\nThey're awesome just because they're just they're like Neo in the matrix like they're they're not even like that's pretty crazy.\n\n40:21.000 --> 40:29.000\nIf you're a fish and you eat a monkey like even though the monkey is my relative I got it.\n\n40:29.000 --> 40:32.000\nI'm not I'm not like oh that monkey deserved it.\n\n40:32.000 --> 40:33.000\nI'm not a victim blamer.\n\n40:33.000 --> 40:34.000\nI'm just saying like that's a cool fish.\n\n40:34.000 --> 40:39.000\nHow do you feel about whales.\n\n40:39.000 --> 40:43.000\nI don't I don't I get it.\n\n40:43.000 --> 40:52.000\nYou know I look you know they had legs and they bailed the whales had legs.\n\n40:52.000 --> 40:53.000\nYeah.\n\n40:53.000 --> 40:59.000\nWhales were like I don't know hippos or something and then they went back into the ocean like they're like just can't do it.\n\n40:59.000 --> 41:01.000\nDo they have vestigial hind legs.\n\n41:01.000 --> 41:02.000\nI think they have yet.\n\n41:02.000 --> 41:04.000\nYou can see from the hip bones.\n\n41:04.000 --> 41:05.000\nAll right.\n\n41:05.000 --> 41:06.000\nI mean they're mammals that live in the ocean.\n\n41:06.000 --> 41:07.000\nYeah.\n\n41:07.000 --> 41:12.000\nLet's not Jeff please Jeff mammals.\n\n41:12.000 --> 41:17.000\nDolphins sea lions walruses.\n\n41:17.000 --> 41:25.000\nYou know these are these are these are these are mammals that spent some time enough time on land that they had they have shoulders and hips.\n\n41:25.000 --> 41:28.000\nAnd then they then they went back into the ocean.\n\n41:28.000 --> 41:30.000\nWhy do you think they went back.\n\n41:30.000 --> 41:32.000\nI mean there was too many birds.\n\n41:32.000 --> 41:38.000\nI don't want to punch down but it's like I mean you said they gave up.\n\n41:38.000 --> 41:42.000\nNo they they went for they went for the brass ring.\n\n41:42.000 --> 41:43.000\nOf course they gave up.\n\n41:43.000 --> 41:46.000\nThey went back to the where amoebas are.\n\n41:46.000 --> 41:47.000\nThey.\n\n41:47.000 --> 41:48.000\nYeah they gave up.\n\n41:48.000 --> 41:49.000\nThey went up there.\n\n41:49.000 --> 41:50.000\nIt's fucking crazy out here.\n\n41:50.000 --> 41:53.000\nThere's a son that fucking beats your ass all day long and it's fucking.\n\n41:53.000 --> 41:54.000\nThey might have just chose.\n\n41:54.000 --> 41:55.000\nWater.\n\n41:55.000 --> 41:56.000\nThere's tigers.\n\n41:56.000 --> 41:57.000\nThere's giraffes peeing on each other.\n\n41:57.000 --> 41:59.000\nI'd rather go back and swim.\n\n41:59.000 --> 42:00.000\nYeah.\n\n42:00.000 --> 42:02.000\nI just you know how people go like oh dolphins.\n\n42:02.000 --> 42:07.000\nSo how do we know they're not like the best species ever because just because we can't\n\n42:07.000 --> 42:09.000\nunderstand them because they squeak when they talk.\n\n42:09.000 --> 42:14.000\nWell I'll tell you how we know because they were they were like dogs that bailed.\n\n42:14.000 --> 42:16.000\nThat's how we know they were on land.\n\n42:16.000 --> 42:17.000\nThey had a shot.\n\n42:17.000 --> 42:19.000\nThey had a shot.\n\n42:19.000 --> 42:21.000\nDolphins are smarter than dogs.\n\n42:21.000 --> 42:22.000\nYeah.\n\n42:22.000 --> 42:24.000\nI'm sure dolphins are smarter than a lot of things.\n\n42:24.000 --> 42:28.000\nBut you know what they're not smarter than us because they fucking like we stuck it out\n\n42:28.000 --> 42:29.000\nman.\n\n42:29.000 --> 42:30.000\nWe're like all right.\n\n42:30.000 --> 42:31.000\nHere we go.\n\n42:31.000 --> 42:33.000\nI think a great time to climb a tree motherfucker.\n\n42:33.000 --> 42:36.000\nWhat about what about like a fucking badass crocodile.\n\n42:36.000 --> 42:39.000\nLike doesn't they have no enemies.\n\n42:39.000 --> 42:43.000\nThere's no there's no one above them in the food chain crocodiles and alligators.\n\n42:43.000 --> 42:46.000\nYou got to you got to give them props right because they're like basically dinosaurs.\n\n42:46.000 --> 42:48.000\nThey they're like they stuck it out.\n\n42:48.000 --> 42:53.000\nThey're like they're like your friend that listens to vinyl but like they but actually\n\n42:53.000 --> 42:56.000\nhas like a system that we're like actually I got to hand it to you.\n\n42:56.000 --> 43:02.000\nYou're not just jerking yourself off here like you this works like I can't get purple\n\n43:02.000 --> 43:06.000\npurple people either on iTunes.\n\n43:06.000 --> 43:07.000\nYeah man.\n\n43:07.000 --> 43:08.000\nYou got it.\n\n43:08.000 --> 43:12.000\nYou know like like like when you have a friend that's like a vinyl hipster that's like you\n\n43:12.000 --> 43:14.000\nactually can see the practicality in it.\n\n43:14.000 --> 43:19.000\nBut if you put a giraffe versus a crocodile.\n\n43:19.000 --> 43:20.000\nYeah.\n\n43:20.000 --> 43:22.000\nGiraffes gonna win.\n\n43:22.000 --> 43:24.000\nCannot run him or but I'm not a violent.\n\n43:24.000 --> 43:27.000\nI don't believe that what what's then sharks.\n\n43:27.000 --> 43:28.000\nWe should all love sharks.\n\n43:28.000 --> 43:29.000\nRight.\n\n43:29.000 --> 43:30.000\nSharks are fucking dicks.\n\n43:30.000 --> 43:32.000\nSharks are the worst.\n\n43:32.000 --> 43:33.000\nYou don't like sharks.\n\n43:33.000 --> 43:34.000\nNo sharks are assholes.\n\n43:34.000 --> 43:41.000\nSharks are sharks are amoeba that just fucking like fucking voted for Trump at every like\n\n43:41.000 --> 43:43.000\nevolutionary election.\n\n43:43.000 --> 43:47.000\nThey just they just turned into they just everybody was like like like the other amoeba were like\n\n43:47.000 --> 43:53.000\nwe're gonna become worms and tubes and the sharks are the ones that were like yeah but\n\n43:53.000 --> 43:57.000\nwouldn't we need teeth to like eat and everyone's like okay cool you can do that but there's\n\n43:57.000 --> 44:02.000\nno plants to eat and they're just like nah and then just like they just turned into giant\n\n44:02.000 --> 44:04.000\nmouths that just float through the ocean.\n\n44:04.000 --> 44:10.000\nWhat's the difference between you glorifying humans for sticking it out on land versus sharks\n\n44:10.000 --> 44:12.000\nsticking it out in the water and perfecting being in the water.\n\n44:12.000 --> 44:15.000\nWell I'm gonna say across the board if you're in the ocean you're a pussy.\n\n44:15.000 --> 44:18.000\nLike I'm just saying like you're either.\n\n44:18.000 --> 44:20.000\nThat is a fucking hard stance.\n\n44:20.000 --> 44:24.000\nI know well also I didn't want to this thing is like language fails me because it's like\n\n44:24.000 --> 44:28.000\nanything like I'm trying I've been trying to like remove that from my vocabulary because\n\n44:28.000 --> 44:33.000\nit's like it's you know like I used to I used to say fag and retard and stuff too and\n\n44:33.000 --> 44:38.000\nlike I had to like teach myself to like knock it off and like pussies like but it's hard\n\n44:38.000 --> 44:41.000\nlike I need like a you know I want to talk about it.\n\n44:41.000 --> 44:45.000\nIf you can go back in time and still use the words fag pussy and retard what are your\n\n44:45.000 --> 44:55.000\nthoughts?\n\n44:55.000 --> 44:57.000\nLet's put the n-word back on the table too.\n\n44:57.000 --> 45:00.000\nGuys we are living it in a time when I can use all those words.\n\n45:00.000 --> 45:02.000\nIt's a choice.\n\n45:02.000 --> 45:07.000\nThat's the secret service didn't come to my house.\n\n45:07.000 --> 45:11.000\nMy doctor didn't tell me to cut down on the n-word.\n\n45:11.000 --> 45:17.000\nI'm going to say the word giraffe and then I'm going to say fag pussy and retard and\n\n45:17.000 --> 45:21.000\nthen what you did not my doctor did tell me.\n\n45:21.000 --> 45:27.000\nIt's a new it's a new board game which I used to be in the nation biology classes everywhere\n\n45:27.000 --> 45:29.000\nplaying fag pussy and retard.\n\n45:29.000 --> 45:34.000\nIf you pay five dollars a month for subscription to Harmontown you can find out whether Dan\n\n45:34.000 --> 45:36.000\nthinks giraffes are fags.\n\n45:36.000 --> 45:41.000\nWait but then we should make it a full fuck Mary kill and have three animals into and play\n\n45:41.000 --> 45:42.000\nfag pussy retard.\n\n45:42.000 --> 45:44.000\nI'm not I'm not I'm not subscribing.\n\n45:44.000 --> 45:46.000\nI didn't say any of those words.\n\n45:46.000 --> 45:51.000\nBut all I'm saying is like if you're in the ocean.\n\n45:51.000 --> 45:53.000\nYou called all sea animals pussies.\n\n45:53.000 --> 45:57.000\nI know I'm I've been biting my lip trying to think of like a way to say like I'm saying\n\n45:57.000 --> 46:06.000\nlike like you you're you're in the in the year if you're in the ocean the earth is 85%\n\n46:06.000 --> 46:07.000\nwater.\n\n46:07.000 --> 46:08.000\nOkay.\n\n46:08.000 --> 46:14.000\nSo as we all know every human being is 85% moron like like like everything everything\n\n46:14.000 --> 46:20.000\nis 85% garbage hack dumb 85% of all dentists suck at dentistry.\n\n46:20.000 --> 46:23.000\nYou know 85% of all comics are unfunny.\n\n46:23.000 --> 46:32.000\nYou know 85% of this podcast is this retarded like 85% of the planet is water 85% of our\n\n46:32.000 --> 46:33.000\nbody is watered.\n\n46:33.000 --> 46:34.000\nIt's like it's like yeah it's the default.\n\n46:34.000 --> 46:35.000\nIt's where we started.\n\n46:35.000 --> 46:36.000\nOkay.\n\n46:36.000 --> 46:38.000\nI'm a little I'm a little teapot here.\n\n46:38.000 --> 46:39.000\nI'm called I'm an amoeba.\n\n46:39.000 --> 46:40.000\nI'm like okay.\n\n46:40.000 --> 46:41.000\nI got a organelle.\n\n46:41.000 --> 46:42.000\nI got some ribosomes.\n\n46:42.000 --> 46:48.000\nI'm going and then it's like yeah you have you have I forgive you because I am you.\n\n46:48.000 --> 46:52.000\nI'm your great grandson amoeba like but but.\n\n46:52.000 --> 46:58.000\nBut the the amoeba that exists today right now the modern amoeba.\n\n46:58.000 --> 47:02.000\nHe was just born a couple days ago.\n\n47:02.000 --> 47:05.000\nHe's an idiot like he's a jerk.\n\n47:05.000 --> 47:12.000\nHis parents like we we are a part of the family that branched off like our DNA was assembled\n\n47:12.000 --> 47:20.480\nby like you know risk takers like we're we're we're a we're a branch of the of the phenomenon\n\n47:20.480 --> 47:23.680\ncalled living genetics.\n\n47:23.680 --> 47:31.680\nWe are the tentacle coming off of that one thing that is the tentacle that actually grabs\n\n47:31.680 --> 47:33.240\nthe brass ring.\n\n47:33.240 --> 47:37.800\nAll the other tentacles are like you know just for safety's sake why not stay in albino\n\n47:37.800 --> 47:38.800\ncave fish.\n\n47:38.800 --> 47:45.640\nWell I'll tell you why you can't you can't see anything it's ridiculous what about birds\n\n47:45.640 --> 47:53.280\nbirds came everything came from the sea and we haven't got to the air and they were descended\n\n47:53.280 --> 48:00.960\nfrom like land reptiles they go fuck it I'm going to master the sky they were flying for\n\n48:00.960 --> 48:06.840\nmillions of years you know insects did that it's dumb spores do that oh I'm going to\n\n48:06.840 --> 48:12.600\nforce a great I'm going to fly through the air and land on shit I just think it's cooler\n\n48:12.600 --> 48:18.280\nto be a lizard and then go up on two legs and like I mean it's just kind of neat kind\n\n48:18.280 --> 48:25.120\nof cool kind of cool what we did we come out of the water we had we had to have like a\n\n48:25.120 --> 48:30.880\nscuba tank lung full of water for a while so I learned to like got better lungs and\n\n48:30.880 --> 48:38.800\ncould breathe air like got was crawling got fur now this is where some of our cousins\n\n48:38.800 --> 48:43.080\ngot weird fur that turned into feathers and started flapping around I don't know what to\n\n48:43.080 --> 48:46.840\nthink about them you're talking about them like they're gods or angels I just don't I\n\n48:46.840 --> 48:51.200\njust think that they're like your weird cousin you know the liberal arts major or something\n\n48:51.200 --> 48:55.960\nI just I don't know whether to admire them or not I just don't I know well I'm saying\n\n48:55.960 --> 49:01.440\nlike I don't I don't I'm not like looking up at birds and going like fuck they really\n\n49:01.440 --> 49:07.040\nnailed it because I just they have hollow bones you know that's why is that bad they\n\n49:07.040 --> 49:11.320\nhave brains the size of a of the head of a pin like they don't even I don't think they\n\n49:11.320 --> 49:16.840\nknow what they're doing honestly half the time I think you nailed it with what I immediately\n\n49:16.840 --> 49:23.200\nimagined as like an inspirational motivational poster and an office setting with the dolphins\n\n49:23.200 --> 49:28.600\nare dogs to gave up and just like a beautiful picture of dolphins yeah don't be a dolphin\n\n49:28.600 --> 49:35.400\nbeat the dog stick it out yeah so but here's the thing is big fans of my podcast already\n\n49:35.400 --> 49:40.560\nknow you've listened to 400 episodes of the show you know I subscribe to the Elaine Morgan\n\n49:40.560 --> 49:46.240\ntheory of of human evolution which is explains the fact that we're different from chimps\n\n49:46.240 --> 49:52.920\ngorillas and orangutans in all the ways that dolphins sea lions walruses are different\n\n49:52.920 --> 49:58.720\nfrom other mammals we have everything in common with dolphins and whatnot that we don't have\n\n49:58.720 --> 50:07.320\nin common with our great great ape cousins and Elaine Morgan suggests that that's because\n\n50:07.320 --> 50:14.200\nfour million years ago we too flirted with the dolphin root just long enough to lose\n\n50:14.200 --> 50:22.560\nour hair get blubbery fat and regulatable breathing upright vertical posture and then\n\n50:22.560 --> 50:28.160\nfor some reason fucking we toughed it up what have got back on that land and that's why\n\n50:28.160 --> 50:33.360\nour story structure follows that one of dolphins dolphins kicked us out of the sea oh my god\n\n50:33.360 --> 50:39.000\nlike we were exiled to land or we or we got jealous of them like we saw we just they were\n\n50:39.000 --> 50:45.560\nlike hey you want to play and we're like oh yeah I think I forgot my phone and we were\n\n50:45.560 --> 50:51.400\njust like petty abaticus or like that's the thing about the aquatic ape theory is that\n\n50:51.400 --> 50:59.520\nthat your early hominoids fled to the water's edge because it was full of giant animal I'm\n\n50:59.520 --> 51:07.480\nnot gonna lie if I'm playing the first person shooter of ancient earth yeah that's thoughts\n\n51:07.480 --> 51:12.480\ngonna cross my head like let's why don't we stand in the ocean see if this tiger wants\n\n51:12.480 --> 51:17.960\nto if a big ass saber to the tigers coming at you I go I can I can go paddle out and\n\n51:17.960 --> 51:22.240\nthink oh like oh there's food down here I can I can hold my breath for five seconds and\n\n51:22.240 --> 51:27.360\ngo get an abalone and oh this is giving me all these B vitamins and my brain expands\n\n51:27.360 --> 51:32.600\nyeah and I come back out of the ocean and go oh I like I'm smarter now I can probably\n\n51:32.600 --> 51:37.640\nmake a weapon and kill these tigers but there was also the thing I why not just live in\n\n51:37.640 --> 51:42.880\nthe water and I can know because there's things worse than tigers in the ocean there's sharks\n\n51:42.880 --> 51:46.680\nit could have I mean it could have just been ambition it could have been like okay let's\n\n51:46.680 --> 51:53.600\nstay in the water but like you know see you later and the people that did stay in the\n\n51:53.600 --> 51:59.240\nwater were out hunted and there are there are people in Africa that live like very much\n\n51:59.240 --> 52:05.800\nlike you know the women give birth in the in the in the surf they squat and the baby\n\n52:05.800 --> 52:13.040\ncomes out like a little wine cork and a little poop and they kind of they kind of bobbed to\n\n52:13.040 --> 52:19.280\nthe surface the iron isles I don't know if it's the iron isles or not like I haven't\n\n52:19.280 --> 52:28.080\nI haven't I haven't spent a long time since I looked at the maps but the but it could\n\n52:28.080 --> 52:31.720\nalso be what I mean and this is cartoonish of me to suggest because I don't really don't\n\n52:31.720 --> 52:35.520\nknow anything I'm obviously I'm talking about but could it could it also have been an ice\n\n52:35.520 --> 52:42.320\nage like is that cartoonish thinking well maybe we had a semi-aquatic phase during the time\n\n52:42.320 --> 52:47.440\nwhen the the primates in general are the are the reason that they're all going extinct\n\n52:47.440 --> 52:59.360\nis because there we are the result of a particularly like lush equatorial like super rich kind\n\n52:59.360 --> 53:08.280\nof like a tropical biome you know that like could afford to sustain a great ape which is\n\n53:08.280 --> 53:12.560\nan ape that can't even fucking climb trees anymore basically like like doesn't have a\n\n53:12.560 --> 53:20.760\ntail anymore and and is a big giant just almost waste of time except for yours truly hello\n\n53:20.760 --> 53:25.440\nold so-and-so so that's why I don't like giraffes you know because I just feel like\n\n53:25.440 --> 53:31.200\nthey're glorified like there's nothing in the who's out there the thing horrifying giraffes\n\n53:31.200 --> 53:42.960\nwho's who's a big deal about giraffes Africa leans on them pretty hard if you like commercial\n\n53:42.960 --> 53:50.760\nfor Africa I think of elephants personally but I was in a in a hot tub at the Disney\n\n53:50.760 --> 53:58.160\nWorld's Africa what church what's that resort called with the the African resort in Florida\n\n53:58.160 --> 54:05.480\nanimal kingdom so we just like drank every a beer in every country in Epcot it's called\n\n54:05.480 --> 54:11.520\ndrinking the world I made it through then we went back to the crib no we saw like Cirque\n\n54:11.520 --> 54:17.680\nde Soleil everyone fell asleep I made it through somehow I went back and took a like a like\n\n54:17.680 --> 54:22.120\na Vicodin or a Percocet or something like that and sat in a jacuzzi and I was so drunk\n\n54:22.120 --> 54:26.800\nand I took this painkiller and I felt like I was floating above the jacuzzi and a fucking\n\n54:26.800 --> 54:32.320\ngiraffe walked by like right next to the fence where I was and there was a big ass giraffe\n\n54:32.320 --> 54:38.200\nwalked by and just gave me a look in the look even if I weren't drunk and on a painkiller\n\n54:38.200 --> 54:45.560\nthe look was like you fucking drunk bro fucking gave me a very like a very professional like\n\n54:45.560 --> 54:52.160\nfatherly kind of like wow then he peed in my mouth and I started fucking him do you\n\n54:52.160 --> 54:58.440\nmean fucking him and I mean I was fucking here's the thing about fucking a giraffe\n\n54:58.440 --> 55:02.200\nyou really gotta get up there you need a lot of I think that giraffe because he's a his\n\n55:02.200 --> 55:07.000\nDNA is old and African I think he was looking he was going by and looking at a monkey in\n\n55:07.000 --> 55:13.360\nsome water and going like when are you guys gonna pick a lane pick away I thought I thought\n\n55:13.360 --> 55:18.960\nthe giraffe was seeing you be in a in a body of water like swimming or something but you\n\n55:18.960 --> 55:22.800\nknow like I can't as you know that they they choose not to swim right no they choose not\n\n55:22.800 --> 55:28.000\nto speak they can't swim well they've no one's ever seen what no one's ever seen hard to\n\n55:28.000 --> 55:33.120\nbelieve we've electrocuted an elephant for fun I will I will donate right drop my thing\n\n55:33.120 --> 55:43.880\nI'm looking where's my camera $50,000 for footage of a giraffe swimming oh no huh I don't care\n\n55:43.880 --> 55:48.680\nif you can be breaststroke and I want to see a fucking giraffe breaststroke breaststroke\n\n55:48.680 --> 55:55.080\nI just just making it from one from point A to point B and just completely swimming along\n\n55:55.080 --> 55:59.680\nwell you know there's that what is that like British show like called the sex box where\n\n55:59.680 --> 56:04.760\nthere's a big box and the people go and have sex in the box on stage completely in private\n\n56:04.760 --> 56:08.560\nmaybe if we set something like that up then a giraffe would maybe feel more comfortable\n\n56:08.560 --> 56:12.880\nswimming because no one would actually be seeing it swim I think you're asked probably\n\n56:12.880 --> 56:16.800\ndo swim they're just embarrassed about it clearly also I think probably when no one's\n\n56:16.800 --> 56:26.320\nlistening they're fucking chatting up a storm I will be great what do you think a giraffe\n\n56:26.320 --> 56:37.440\nsounds like like a like a like a high pitched cow well just do can't you just that's I would\n\n56:37.440 --> 56:51.840\npick that as a giraffe sound yes that's a good one what do you do you give us a giraffe\n\n56:51.840 --> 56:59.760\ndid that get picked up at all it might be one of those I put my hand over the mic it\n\n56:59.760 --> 57:05.520\nmight be guttural and a camel like it's camels yeah I think it camels okay so we're talking\n\n57:05.520 --> 57:10.760\nabout a tenor camel like a camera is like a camel is like a there's footage of giraffe\n\n57:10.760 --> 57:15.760\nbaritone right giraffe spit at people that's camels well camels do that but that's what\n\n57:15.760 --> 57:20.440\nI'm saying like maybe they're oh just their last name or their Roman name is that they\n\n57:20.440 --> 57:27.440\nlooked like it has something to do with camels because they the Romans or whoever was spotted\n\n57:27.440 --> 57:33.880\nthem was said this is a like a weird camel that makes sense yeah weird camel weird everything's\n\n57:33.880 --> 57:40.520\na weird camel yeah you can't you can't just add weird to that's like a are giraffes drama\n\n57:40.520 --> 57:44.720\ndairies or no I was gonna say I think they are but are they part of the drama dairy family\n\n57:44.720 --> 57:49.200\nor no drama dairy that's a I don't know I don't know the word that word didn't you just\n\n57:49.200 --> 57:53.520\nGoogle is a couple nights ago Tom Rob I call you Tom I don't want your Tom all of a sudden\n\n57:53.520 --> 58:00.520\nthe Roman taxonomical chart is just all it's just a chicken at the top and then everything\n\n58:00.520 --> 58:07.400\nthat tastes like chicken which is everything just down in different weird camel tastes\n\n58:07.400 --> 58:12.160\nlike chicken I just thought that was like that whatever I didn't can I I didn't kind\n\n58:12.160 --> 58:20.800\nof that's very well you know the Romans would bring on the triumphs when they would conquer\n\n58:20.800 --> 58:26.360\nlike cities in Africa or and you know like the the Middle East and stuff and they'd bring\n\n58:26.360 --> 58:31.720\nback these animals and they'd walk them they bring an elephant back to Rome everybody lose\n\n58:31.720 --> 58:35.440\ntheir fucking mind and it's like what the world's full of aliens and then they just\n\n58:35.440 --> 58:42.840\nattack it with swords yeah I'm no I don't think it's funny animal cruelty I just think\n\n58:42.840 --> 58:48.120\nit's funny how dumb we are is like that that that you I don't know it's just like little\n\n58:48.120 --> 58:53.080\nkids understand that giraffes aren't shouldn't be fought with swords but Romans didn't like\n\n58:53.080 --> 58:57.800\nknow that yet you know like they just they just took giraffes and put them in the Coliseum\n\n58:57.800 --> 59:01.800\nand then had like a slave attack it with a stick you know her badass and nobody fucks\n\n59:01.800 --> 59:06.080\nwith as an adult zebra zebras will fucking get you they'll fuck it they're just made\n\n59:06.080 --> 59:12.640\nof muscle their horses like with muscles horses are scary like I don't know I think we take\n\n59:12.640 --> 59:17.960\nhorses for granted because they're common animals you know but when you see a horse it's\n\n59:17.960 --> 59:23.240\nlike that's a fucking monster like if this thing had scales I would be running but you\n\n59:23.240 --> 59:27.560\nnotice that we've never domesticated zebras because you can't because they won't be fucking\n\n59:27.560 --> 59:31.440\ndomesticated you cannot you've never seen anybody riding a zebra because zebra will\n\n59:31.440 --> 59:41.600\neat you they have a lot of them in Tijuana what it's they have a you know Tijuana Tijuana\n\n59:41.600 --> 59:46.960\nthey yeah they have like that's donkeys I know they spray paint them I'm just I was\n\n59:46.960 --> 59:51.680\ndoing

reason\n\n59:58.400 --> 01:00:05.920\nthey love Tweety Bird but but like I they just every street corner it's just it's like\n\n01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:12.800\na thing that they you spray you paint the donkey with stripes and then you like you charge\n\n01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:18.120\npeople to take a picture standing with the donkey that's fucked up but a zebra will kick\n\n01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:23.560\nyour ass a zebra will beat up a horse I want to see zebra versus giraffe I wonder how much\n\n01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:29.200\nflexibility is in that marketplace like if I'm a Tijuana businessman and I have a donkey\n\n01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:37.840\nlike like are they being like just unimaginative or is this like a steel trap of a market where\n\n01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:44.040\nlike if you like one guy tries to put antlers and then it's just like fucking boo no like\n\n01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:49.400\nhis family starves it's just like fuck you you idiot like like they have reality

whatever their sting is and then it goes to commercial what if somebody\n\n01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:28.280\nbrought an actual zebra down to Tijuana like would that fuck up the marketplace or the\n\n01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:36.480\nholy shit that's like a Nathan for you yeah let's pitch it just bring a real zebra down\n\n01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:43.120\nto Tijuana I think I think that zebra

a rubop until the news drops that Spencer's been forcing potted\n\n01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:37.560\nplants to watch him jerk off for five years that's still legal right is that out of fact\n\n01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:42.160\ncertainly legal right I just don't know how that affects our business model our podcast\n\n01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:47.600\nI would like to say is well I don't want to jinx it but we are we are we are we are proofed\n\n01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:55.920\nagainst future allegations because I have spent 40 years just terrified of women I may\n\n01:05:55.920 --> 01:06:02.480\nhave treated them poorly I certainly like thought of them in my head wrongly but I I\n\n01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:08.640\nmean no way if I have thought about having a button installed on my desk that would lock\n\n01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:15.440\nmy door to keep people out while I jerk off thinking about a mannequin I am I will not\n\n01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:22.400\nhurt anyone you will not find out I've hurt anyone I am just scared Jeff to cocky he would\n\n01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:28.280\nnever I mean I just like to get along with people yeah Spencer this seems like tempting\n\n01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:35.200\nfate right let's let's really tap that business well I was gonna do comedy comes with three\n\n01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:43.040\nthings I was gonna say something like Spencer never leaves evidence yeah no I'm also terrified\n\n01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:52.120\nof what Spencer no loose ends that's what we call it old 50 gallon drum crittenden when\n\n01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:56.240\nI think of things I did wrong I remember like in seventh grade there was like a hair on the\n\n01:06:56.240 --> 01:07:02.680\nback of this girls shirt and I wanted to take it off but you know like I didn't do it I I\n\n01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:08.040\ntouched her back instead and then I was like oh man I've done awful things like that I look\n\n01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:14.800\nback on I just to clear the air what do we just say because I'm undoing the joke I'm\n\n01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:20.440\nsad like when I was like 19 years old I went on a date with a girl and I remember like\n\n01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:26.240\nI pulled her back into the car for like like like she clearly didn't want to like a mart\n\n01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:33.200\nlike a 10 and like I mean I just I feel horrified even say the thing is like I don't like I'm\n\n01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:37.600\nlike saying those words out loud it's like oh Jesus you pull like like what you did what\n\n01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:42.240\nbut I never said the words out loud it's like but it's a thing that I did like I I didn't\n\n01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:50.640\nlike it was just like I I it wasn't like hateful but it was like I grabbed I grabbed and I\n\n01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:54.960\nclinged and I was like I was like come on don't go you know like like she decided the date\n\n01:07:54.960 --> 01:08:03.640\nwas over you know yeah so there's one like if we go back that far and you know if they\n\n01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:09.120\nthey find out also you've been fucking everyone's mama for as long as this podcast has been\n\n01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:18.200\ngoing on I mean you've been pretty candid about that what else have I done I think you\n\n01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:22.400\nfuck someone's mama on the lawn that was MC John I think of it I think if you get into\n\n01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:28.000\nthe ex girlfriends like I just think or at a definitely web bookmarks like I'm just in\n\n01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:35.000\nbig trouble are you are you complicit in victimization because otherwise I think you're in the clear\n\n01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:38.440\nno but I think but when you hear about like inappropriate behavior that means like the\n\n01:08:38.440 --> 01:08:43.800\nsurf is getting close to my cabana right because I don't know what inappropriate behavior\n\n01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:49.040\nis I did that you just see that in the headline I if that I I always I keep telling myself\n\n01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:54.760\nwell that I hope that means touching and like forcing and like things that have like a clear\n\n01:08:54.760 --> 01:09:00.720\nline around them because if it starts to become like well that joke wasn't very funny but\n\n01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:04.120\nhe kept then he doubled down on it and he kept telling that joke you know like like\n\n01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:08.120\nstuff that's like a legitimate grievance like I don't know there's probably people out\n\n01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:12.600\nthere with stories you know that Al Franken thing it's kind of weird I was arguing with\n\n01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:16.680\nsomeone on Twitter about this and I think they turned out to be right but they were\n\n01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:21.640\nmad because people were kind of lumping the two allegations together the groping allegation\n\n01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:29.840\nand the kissing allegation and Al Franken is kind of denied the severity although he apologized\n\n01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:35.240\nabout the groping thing because it was like this was a staged photo or whatever but then\n\n01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:41.240\nhe kind of just said as for the kiss I don't remember that but that's arguably a more egregious\n\n01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:46.400\noffense because it includes potentially forcing his tongue down into her mouth which is like\n\n01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:50.360\nthat's it's pretty gross and the person was saying that lumping them together means that\n\n01:09:50.360 --> 01:09:53.440\nwouldn't get taken separately and then people would focus on the groping which is easier\n\n01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:57.760\nto dismiss and so you're kind of you know you know dealing with that way but we really\n\n01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:06.240\nkind of don't talk about that part of it which is to me a lot more aggressive I know but\n\n01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:11.200\nevery time we start talking about it we're it's if we if we're saying anything other\n\n01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:19.920\nthan look I did something I I'm thinking differently whatever like it's like like we can only have\n\n01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:28.160\nthese conversations about like what anything that mitigates the idea of of a of a of a\n\n01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:33.720\nclaim is like kind of that's a hot stove for who knows how long I don't know how long that\n\n01:10:33.720 --> 01:10:40.280\nstove will stay just like bright red hot I'm not I'm not touching it I did it was good\n\n01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:44.520\nI just think that I've thought the same thoughts though it's a bummer because well one one thing\n\n01:10:44.520 --> 01:10:48.560\nis hearsay and one thing is like a but I and I talked about that last week where it was\n\n01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:54.840\nlike that the the weird thing about it is that I felt I I could put my I found myself\n\n01:10:54.840 --> 01:11:00.480\nbecoming like a weird liberal version of a Roy Moore supporter almost like it's it's\n\n01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:06.240\nlike a microcosm thing because it was like as soon as I started freaking out about net\n\n01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:10.920\nneutrality and thinking that there was a political reason for any of this then I immediately\n\n01:11:10.920 --> 01:11:15.760\nstarted going like well what if this woman's just lying you know right and the and the\n\n01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:23.880\nand the phrase what if this woman's just lying has to be a I think of well well my rule to\n\n01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:29.280\nmy game I'm playing is that's not a that's not a conch that's available that's behind\n\n01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:34.000\nglass for about five years but you don't have to be all clear like you know you're not advertising\n\n01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:37.480\nthat though you're just explaining your thought process if thoughts enter your head that's\n\n01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:42.480\njust kind of you can't stop that it's how you deal with those thoughts and yeah and I don't\n\n01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:47.800\nthink you've been like that's why I would put a button on my desk I locked my door can't\n\n01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:56.160\ncontrol thoughts I just think like that but just to be clear again it's to keep people\n\n01:11:56.160 --> 01:12:02.800\nout not to keep people in when I went to University Southern California like I had I stayed in\n\n01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:13.720\nthe dorm where a lot of film student kids were and mostly guys that that I met anyway\n\n01:12:13.720 --> 01:12:21.120\nif those guys a lot of whom were rich kids that are going to go on to have like lots\n\n01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:30.120\nof access and lots of power in the film community if they ever were going to be the Harvey Weinstein\n\n01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:40.320\nhe kind of gropey rapey asshole gross guy I think there's a huge part of like men going\n\n01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:47.520\ninto positions of power with government or film and like I can control what women do\n\n01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:51.680\nlike I can make that I have you tell them to do things yeah I can make them do things\n\n01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:57.520\nthat they might not want to do because I'm in a position to affect their lives and careers\n\n01:12:57.520 --> 01:13:03.400\nI don't care how many people have to fucking go down with the ship of like all these allegations\n\n01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:08.000\nright now I would like to think that if you're in a film school right now and you're a young\n\n01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:13.640\nman going through film school and thinking of being a producer or a director you watch\n\n01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:20.120\nyour fucking step now because if you do anything that's cause for fucking retirement instantly\n\n01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:24.720\nif you haven't thought about it and that's maybe one of the reasons that you haven't\n\n01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:33.240\nthought about is the reason why you want to rap or make movies or ride a unicycle or\n\n01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:39.280\nI think that like for guys it can be a super unspoken super unchallenged thing like yeah\n\n01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:44.320\nyeah well society signals that that's what we should be doing too it's it's it's something\n\n01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:49.320\nthat we've been allowed to not think about for like 60,000 years there's been no sort\n\n01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:53.520\nof damocles over your head like you were allowed to do it and the worst case scenario that\n\n01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:57.720\nyou had a reputation but I mean the media has said the signal that you're a bad you're\n\n01:13:57.720 --> 01:14:01.520\na downtrodden protagonist because you don't have a job and you don't have a girl and then\n\n01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:05.520\nyou go through a journey and you get a job and that gets you a girl and that's succeeding\n\n01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:09.640\nat life that's what we tell people they should do you should get a job because a job will\n\n01:14:09.640 --> 01:14:13.840\nget you a girl and that's you know and there's no agency in that but I think that that's\n\n01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:18.320\nthe signal we've been saying through storytelling for years and years and you know we're only\n\n01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:22.200\njust starting to realize those are the signals we've been sending and that's not necessarily\n\n01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:27.120\nwhat we should be doing although that's still mainly the story underlying a lot of stories\n\n01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:31.720\nis they they go and do some tasks that then gives them professional acumen and a woman\n\n01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:36.360\nyeah go ahead no we were talking about that the other day too like that's the 80s movie\n\n01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:41.320\nthing where you're supposed to root for the underdog who's still a white man but he is\n\n01:14:41.320 --> 01:14:46.640\nlike the beta male and his enemy he's the default he's the base of like the lowest you\n\n01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:53.080\ncan be as a nerd in a school and even if you're white and straight and affluent like you deserve\n\n01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:58.800\nwhatever you're able to get so if you're able to beat the jock then the the getting the\n\n01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:03.800\ngirl is your prize and you've earned it like you're saying the same yeah even in the most\n\n01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:16.480\nwoke 80s culture it was it's like the alpha males Aryan girlfriend who's classically beautiful\n\n01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:22.720\nthat the nerd protagonist wants the whole movie is then the third act as he realizes\n\n01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:27.880\nthat he should have the woman that he had the whole time his best friend who's got maybe\n\n01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:34.600\nshorter darker hair and but it's all it's like the unspoken thing because you watch\n\n01:15:34.600 --> 01:15:37.800\na movie like that you're 10 years old that's the 80s and you go this movie has a pretty\n\n01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:45.120\ngood value system like it taught me not to go for this judge a book by its cover because\n\n01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:50.440\nwhy you know this Daphne oh you can fall for these things and like oh but it's boof that\n\n01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:58.600\nI want I she's my best buddy it that's a that's the that's Teen Wolf the original movie once\n\n01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:05.920\nyou wrote that movie saying like like heroes journeywise like once you become fully self-actualized\n\n01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:10.080\nthat's when you get to have a girl when in real life exactly it's a reward coming a real\n\n01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:15.520\nperson that's exactly the point you know that having a girl in your life who makes you\n\n01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:20.120\nsmarter it's a reward you forget about the way Miller we all we've always known that\n\n01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:24.840\nBudweiser was lying to us by telling us that if we drank Budweiser we get laid like we've\n\n01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:29.120\nwe've all been smart enough to know that we've made fun of that if we are over over a certain\n\n01:16:29.120 --> 01:16:34.760\ntax bracket or IQ but the thing that I think the smartest of us like don't got away with\n\n01:16:34.760 --> 01:16:42.000\nnot thinking about is that idea that that that part of of fulfillment in general spiritual\n\n01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:51.400\nfulfillment even is acquisition of a female yeah is like a coupling up and it's yeah whatever\n\n01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:56.800\nokay we've we've we've we did a good job thing in every mythology it's coming back from like\n\n01:16:56.800 --> 01:17:02.760\nthere's the oneness and then you know in the you know Adam and Eve story it's like man makes\n\n01:17:02.760 --> 01:17:07.600\nGod makes man androgynous and then they split apart and then the whole journey is like they're\n\n01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:12.160\nthey're half of each other and then they have to come back and realize like you know the\n\n01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:16.880\nand then like the father and the I'm I'm mixing things but like the father and the mother the\n\n01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:23.680\nsame thing it's all the oneness that's like when you become fully self actualized and\n\n01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:31.120\nthis like the fulfillment of the self is realizing the male and female in those heteronormative\n\n01:17:31.120 --> 01:17:35.760\nterms are two parts of the one yeah and there's a syndrome there because I don't know why I'm\n\n01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:40.280\nbothering to even look out at a landscape of shit as if I didn't write a pilot where\n\n01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:46.320\nJoel McHale plays a guy who the the thing that is driving was he's trying to fuck Britta\n\n01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:52.440\nso he's doing everything that all of my sexual role models did in the movies that I grew\n\n01:17:52.440 --> 01:17:59.120\nup on that that that socialized me which is he's lying to a woman to try to trick her\n\n01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:08.240\ninto fucking him because if he does that he'll he'll be happier he's and it's romantic because\n\n01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:15.520\nhe oh look how befuddled and what a what a crazy tangled web he's weaving oh you men\n\n01:18:15.520 --> 01:18:21.160\nyou're so you're willing to do so much just to get that sweet pussy it's like it's like\n\n01:18:21.160 --> 01:18:26.480\nwe look I looked at it as like like oh well this is what drives us all it's like wanting\n\n01:18:26.480 --> 01:18:32.200\na hamburger so I'm worried about writing a sitcom what's motivating this protagonist\n\n01:18:32.200 --> 01:18:37.400\nso I did the same thing in the 21st century that I grow grown up on which is just like\n\n01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:45.560\nand and if you ultimately you ultimately make it clear that the that the superior male role\n\n01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:51.520\nmodel male role model is obit like over Jeff who doesn't have those same like as the two\n\n01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:57.280\nparts of that male part not that you know obit is specific maybe throughout the lifetime\n\n01:18:57.280 --> 01:19:01.560\nof the show but the first six episodes of that show are basically like the same old\n\n01:19:01.560 --> 01:19:07.240\nJohn Hughes slash Kevin Smith slash whatever it's just it's just you're you're a man you\n\n01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:11.840\nyou want to get that woman that's but part of that that I think that that's like guys\n\n01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:14.920\nlike me they're just like well I want to write a TV show I want to write a movie I wanted\n\n01:19:14.920 --> 01:19:20.880\nto I need to I need to motivate this character it's like oh well let's put a bone in front\n\n01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:28.600\nof the dog so it goes around the whole circle and and like it you when you know not realizing\n\n01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:36.080\nthat you're you're fundamentally like you're not even like you're going to work out with\n\n01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:39.960\na box around you that you didn't even know you had around you like and then you're and\n\n01:19:39.960 --> 01:19:43.560\nthen you think you're making these decisions but you're like inside this box anyways I'm\n\n01:19:43.560 --> 01:19:47.840\nglad this topic is unavoidable I'm glad that we've we've talked about it consistently for\n\n01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:53.360\nthe last fucking whatever I hope we talk about it for another year and if if you hate every\n\n01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:57.960\ntime it comes up then you're a rapist and I hope we keep talking about it as a group\n\n01:19:57.960 --> 01:20:03.080\nof white men yeah I hope I hope I hope I hope I hope I hope I hope I hope every time we\n\n01:20:03.080 --> 01:20:10.000\ndo it I'm serious I hope someone ends the conversation with with that punch line no\n\n01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:14.840\nI'm serious oh I thought you were I I want I'm gonna have it if we start talking about\n\n01:20:14.840 --> 01:20:21.240\nthis if there's a not white guy on stage I'm gonna shut it down all right because what\n\n01:20:21.240 --> 01:20:34.320\nmore can we add to the perspective I've been sweet sweetie we're trying to do a show yeah\n\n01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:42.200\nI've been doodling over here I drew a kind of a bad giraffe I drew I think like like\n\n01:20:42.200 --> 01:20:47.720\nsome sort of prince with a turban on his head all right how much D&D time do we have\n\n01:20:47.720 --> 01:20:54.560\nleft we got

swear\n\n01:21:05.240 --> 01:21:13.920\ngiraffe slacks I think I'm conflicted about the do we have to have a no applause rule\n\n01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:20.080\nbecause when nine people applaud it just sounds like then then everyone hears the nine people\n\n01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:24.560\nI don't think it's gonna hit the microphones either way I think if you hear all right in\n\n01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:28.480\nthe background I'm gonna listen to it again yeah I know you don't want to you don't want\n\n01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:32.440\nto like walk around with a baseball bat and go okay guys there

that they we associate blonde hair with with youth and\n\n01:23:02.720 --> 01:23:10.600\nby youth I guess they meant babies my beard grows in red sometimes and my mustache is\n\n01:23:10.600 -->

wasn't\n\n01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:24.160\nready for like I think I think I think some dudes from William Morris like went down to\n\n01:27:24.160 --> 01:27:30.000\nan open mic you call that a contract this is a contract and he was like well if you\n\n01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:35.760\nreally think so and they're like oh we think so and then like he was probably 11 years\n\n01:27:35.760 -->

time on Harmontown our heroes were on the quest for Patchen's\n\n01:28:21.480 --> 01:28:28.280\ngym going along with Patchen's to the nearby town of Doornester they encountered Geffen\n\n01:28:28.280 --> 01:28:33.160\nthat guy that they'd met a couple times at this point Geffen was headed to Doornester\n\n01:28:33.160 --> 01:28:40.560\nas well because he suspected the church was on weed then you guys went to the town you\n\n01:28:40.560 --> 01:28:47.120\nsaw some crazy things in the form of zombies and skeletons they seemed bummed out in a\n\n01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:53.760\ngraveyard because music was playing from a harp diarrhea junior tried to inspect the\n\n01:28:53.760 --> 01:29:00.000\nharp music but it vanished in a flash of ruby light and then the zombies attacked like they\n\n01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:07.480\nwere mindless zombies they were dispatched in short order as morning broke it was time\n\n01:29:07.480 --> 01:29:13.520\nto enter Doornester and they met the guards at the front gate applying various methods\n\n01:29:13.520 --> 01:29:20.360\nthey got in the front gate and then they decided that they'd split up but met up and decided\n\n01:29:20.360 --> 01:29:27.640\nthat they wouldn't split up or maybe would that's where they are now follow them today\n\n01:29:27.640 --> 01:29:41.720\nwhat will they do how will they succeed Patchen's gym now perfectly timed to the camera see\n\n01:29:41.720 --> 01:29:48.080\nthat I was like pinching my nipple because I definitely was that whole time I was reading\n\n01:29:48.080 --> 01:29:51.920\nand assuming I was on camera it would be was your left hand you were pinching your right\n\n01:29:51.920 --> 01:29:56.880\nnipple yeah like this is that a thing you do I guess it seems to be right now it seems\n\n01:29:56.880 --> 01:30:03.720\nnormal did I ever tell you guys on this podcast that I my doctor was giving me a testicular\n\n01:30:03.720 --> 01:30:10.680\nexam and my hand drifted up to my nipple like like like just instinctively like because\n\n01:30:10.680 --> 01:30:19.480\nI was like because there was shit going on with my crotch and I think it was like he's\n\n01:30:19.480 --> 01:30:23.720\nlike all right I'll just check it out like and he's and I think it was probably something\n\n01:30:23.720 --> 01:30:32.920\nlike I went like it was just like amazing to me that I would like like that must be\n\n01:30:32.920 --> 01:30:38.760\nsome sort of like like youthful comfort mechanism yeah that's what I think it is I think it's\n\n01:30:38.760 --> 01:30:43.440\njust some weird yeah or a middle-aged comfort mechanism I don't know when I when I went\n\n01:30:43.440 --> 01:30:54.480\nnipples became so important to my bedroom life right they did that that round was bended\n\n01:30:54.480 --> 01:30:59.000\nlike I for sure it's like because like nothing goes on in Harmontown without a nipple being\n\n01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:03.800\ninvolved I saw this like therapist or something she was like a weird lady because she like\n\n01:31:03.800 --> 01:31:08.440\nhad this mailer that's like don't use any scented shampoo or wear any cologne before\n\n01:31:08.440 --> 01:31:13.440\nyou come in the office and stuff like which is just a weird thing for like an anxiety\n\n01:31:13.440 --> 01:31:18.960\ndoctor or something because it's like anxiety inducing but we were sitting in the office\n\n01:31:18.960 --> 01:31:24.520\nand I had my hands in my lap and then she was like do you always cover your genitals\n\n01:31:24.520 --> 01:31:29.040\nwith your hands it's like I just where do I put my hands and then I tried a bunch of\n\n01:31:29.040 --> 01:31:34.480\ndifferent things like to this side to this side to both sides like it's like people put\n\n01:31:34.480 --> 01:31:41.200\ntheir hands in their lap I was doing I was picking different places to put my hands\n\n01:31:41.200 --> 01:31:46.720\nso fast that my knees just started moving on their own I got a pet peeve about that shit\n\n01:31:46.720 --> 01:31:53.040\nthe smells that stuff no the therapeutic technique of asking you stupid questions of just going\n\n01:31:53.040 --> 01:31:57.240\nlike did you notice when I asked you that question your voice got a little quieter or you know\n\n01:31:57.240 --> 01:32:01.280\nlook at your body language right now or like one time one time Cody and I were in couples\n\n01:32:01.280 --> 01:32:08.640\ntherapy and Cody wanted to put a pillow the therapist stepped out of the room and Cody\n\n01:32:08.640 --> 01:32:14.640\nput a pillow between us and then the therapist said she came back in just like see right\n\n01:32:14.640 --> 01:32:19.240\naway I think it's really important that to notice that Cody's created a barrier between\n\n01:32:19.240 --> 01:32:23.800\nthe two of you Cody told me later she was farting and she didn't want to she was she\n\n01:32:23.800 --> 01:32:29.520\nwas worried about farting and like it getting it was like it's like the I just I just like\n\n01:32:29.520 --> 01:32:32.880\nand then when we told the therapist that a week later because I was like you have to\n\n01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:39.120\ntell her that right you were creating a barrier you were protecting me from your farts that's\n\n01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:45.520\nadorable and intimate and and then when we told her that she of course she had to double\n\n01:32:45.520 --> 01:32:49.200\ndown and go like well do you think me she basically said do you think the reason you\n\n01:32:49.200 --> 01:32:54.640\nwere farting so much is because you needed a it is like all right a lot of this stuff\n\n01:32:54.640 --> 01:32:59.040\nis like cold reading stuff it's like let's try to make sense of our occupation here's\n\n01:32:59.040 --> 01:33:02.960\nthe thing I'm a fucking like you know the reason I'm going like this and going like\n\n01:33:02.960 --> 01:33:08.960\nthis isn't always because I'm like being resistant to you or like yeah it's like I don't\n\n01:33:08.960 --> 01:33:15.320\nknow this is who I am you know like I could be like fucking like really open to you and\n\n01:33:15.320 --> 01:33:20.440\nlike really I don't know like yeah I talked to people all the time and like they die like\n\n01:33:20.440 --> 01:33:24.200\nyoung writers ago like because they take like these seminars and stuff and part of it is\n\n01:33:24.200 --> 01:33:28.440\nlike the now the people tell them like well when you pitch like like you should sit straight\n\n01:33:28.440 --> 01:33:32.800\nup and here's what you wear and all this stuff I'm like no go in like a Schrab you think they're\n\n01:33:32.800 --> 01:33:39.320\nlooking for Schrabs all right yeah I always analyze people's body posture and then go\n\n01:33:39.320 --> 01:33:44.000\nthis is stupid like so is that your first notice Spencer that you were touching nipples\n\n01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:49.000\nduring your your no that was just my hands in my lap it was like and then I do that all\n\n01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:52.840\nthe time and then every time I do it I think about it I mean the nipples just now during\n\n01:33:52.840 --> 01:33:56.680\nyour your opening read no I I've probably done that while I was driving it's not like\n\n01:33:56.680 --> 01:34:00.800\na sexual thing but it's just like yeah I guess something that happened I'm not gonna deny\n\n01:34:00.800 --> 01:34:05.760\nthat it feels good it does like that I mean it doesn't feel as good as I always expect\n\n01:34:05.760 --> 01:34:10.520\nit to which is maybe why I keep trying my nipples are too sensitive I'm not a nipple\n\n01:34:10.520 --> 01:34:15.320\nguy yeah that's what I'm saying oh no too sensitive well then well then you know work\n\n01:34:15.320 --> 01:34:20.600\non welcome to the party man so you pinch your nipple no I don't pinch it's not like you\n\n01:34:20.600 --> 01:34:24.520\nrub you rub a little stocking foot on your nipple no I don't wear a stocking no you rub\n\n01:34:24.520 --> 01:34:32.840\na mannequin like I was like how would that fit like I I don't look I like there's nipple\n\n01:34:32.840 --> 01:34:37.280\nplay if you go to bed with me now I don't know when it started I don't know if it was\n\n01:34:37.280 --> 01:34:43.480\na gradual thing I don't know but I know it's full on now now it's just it's man is it almost\n\n01:34:43.480 --> 01:34:48.920\na mandatory it's not mandatory it's just like if you love me you're gonna learn can there\n\n01:34:48.920 --> 01:34:53.400\nbe a sexual encounter with you or does no nipple play no is that is that a lost Dan\n\n01:34:53.400 --> 01:35:01.720\ndoes not go for that I just I yeah I'll do anything if I'm in love with you what I don't\n\n01:35:01.720 --> 01:35:07.080\nyou can poop on me I don't if you need me to not touch my what are my you want to not\n\n01:35:07.080 --> 01:35:13.200\ntouch a wrap all right anyways I'm just saying pretty funny a guy giving me a trying to see\n\n01:35:13.200 --> 01:35:17.600\nif I have cancer and I fucking at it because a hand went towards my groin I have my other\n\n01:35:17.600 --> 01:35:22.360\nhand like shot up to my nipple okay so we're all we're all through the front gate of Dornister\n\n01:35:22.360 --> 01:35:27.400\nright yeah you're kind of let's say you're you're kind of in the shadow of this gate\n\n01:35:27.400 --> 01:35:33.080\nthe the guards seem pretty sleepy and they went back to sleep and they're currently asleep\n\n01:35:33.080 --> 01:35:37.320\nall right so Carlos I know the plan was that we were gonna come in separately yeah it was\n\n01:35:37.320 --> 01:35:43.000\na whole thing it's it but you know here we are let's let's just move ahead but we can\n\n01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:47.080\nnow we can still do what we wanted to do which is the guards don't give a shit they're sleepy\n\n01:35:47.080 --> 01:35:52.760\nthis is this is my thought I think I want to over explain it it's just that like we're\n\n01:35:52.760 --> 01:36:01.800\nin this town we don't really know what we're looking for and more importantly we're we\n\n01:36:01.800 --> 01:36:06.440\nknow there's something afoot in this town we like we need information and we need to\n\n01:36:06.440 --> 01:36:13.440\nlike I feel like it's a disadvantage for us to be perceived as a group let alone a group\n\n01:36:13.440 --> 01:36:18.320\nof church officials why don't we why don't we right now split up and take like different\n\n01:36:18.320 --> 01:36:22.440\nparts of the town different like like maybe I'll go into the tavern or you go into the\n\n01:36:22.440 --> 01:36:29.560\nthing like we'll all pick a like well Spencer what buildings do we see in front of us the\n\n01:36:29.560 --> 01:36:35.400\ntwo seconds like my pitch is well he looks yeah my pitch is it's gonna be harder for\n\n01:36:35.400 --> 01:36:42.680\nme to pretend I'm not a cleric you know I'm I it's you should go go go frequent the taverns\n\n01:36:42.680 --> 01:36:49.120\nor whatever I think I'll go to the local church and just to be clear unless you guys get disguises\n\n01:36:49.120 --> 01:36:53.360\nyou might have plain clothes with you but you're generally adorned in kind of church\n\n01:36:53.360 --> 01:37:00.240\nchurch oriented garments so unless you do something about that you will register as some church\n\n01:37:00.240 --> 01:37:14.640\npeople of some sort we should go shopping what a girl wants what a girl needs Spencer what\n\n01:37:14.640 --> 01:37:19.120\ntime is it when it's like hell yeah it's early morning no it's not early morning it's like\n\n01:37:19.120 --> 01:37:24.800\nmaybe 10 10 a.m. at this point so shops are open shops shops would be open let's let's go\n\n01:37:24.800 --> 01:37:30.480\ninto the clothing store let's pretend we don't know each other well you guys yeah cuz I don't\n\n01:37:30.480 --> 01:37:35.400\nI'm gonna go I'm gonna go check out the church is there a church of the silver flame there\n\n01:37:35.400 --> 01:37:43.960\nsure is I'll go there you guys go shopping and then and then split up we don't need to\n\n01:37:43.960 --> 01:37:50.880\nsplit up we're not wearing church clothes you currently are then you're gonna go shopping\n\n01:37:50.880 --> 01:37:54.960\ntogether yeah then you're gonna split up like Cisco and Ebert at the end of at the movies\n\n01:37:54.960 --> 01:38:01.000\nlike people are gonna know are there any vendors like selling garments like out in the town\n\n01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:08.600\nlike or do I have to go into like a dedicated clothing shop there yeah there's like an open\n\n01:38:08.600 --> 01:38:14.400\near market that has some smaller shops and mostly stores so yeah so I go wandering around\n\n01:38:14.400 --> 01:38:20.160\nlooking for a clothing vendor to maybe find something to like disguise myself as maybe\n\n01:38:20.160 --> 01:38:26.160\njust a regular citizen all right you find what late what's labeled by a wooden sign\n\n01:38:26.160 --> 01:38:31.400\nas the open-air black market there's a row of shops and stalls there's kind of two rows\n\n01:38:31.400 --> 01:38:37.640\nthat flank this it's wider than a street but it's it's kind of like a street all the stalls\n\n01:38:37.640 --> 01:38:43.040\nthat are open are are kind of guarded by a couple shopkeepers that are keeping all their\n\n01:38:43.040 --> 01:38:50.760\nwares like hidden under cloths and sheets and stuff so it's all like secret kind of secret\n\n01:38:50.760 --> 01:38:55.280\nwares most of these places are closed and shuttered it's very striking you might you\n\n01:38:55.280 --> 01:39:01.040\nwonder if there's like a recession or something a couple gold pieces out in my hand and I just\n\n01:39:01.040 --> 01:39:05.600\nkind of I'm kind of tossing them up and down like playing it cool but like clearly somebody\n\n01:39:05.600 --> 01:39:13.880\nthat's
