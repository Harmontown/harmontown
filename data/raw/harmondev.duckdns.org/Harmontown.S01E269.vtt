00:00.000 --> 00:29.000
Let's bring up the man, the game master, Spencer Crittenden, everybody.

00:29.000 --> 00:39.000
And the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.

00:39.000 --> 00:57.000
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, my beats are cold, my mama is old, still went to bed with her yesterday.

00:57.000 --> 01:03.000
Yo, I fucked your, what am I, I don't even, kind of lost already.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
Fucked my own mom.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
Your heart's not even in it.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
Yeah.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
I thought I misheard you, but yeah, you were fucking your own mom.

01:08.000 --> 01:13.000
If you could fuck anybody's mom, like think of it throughout history.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
Whose mom would you fuck?

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
Alright.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
Yours.

01:17.000 --> 01:33.000
Yo, Ben Franklin's mom was out on the lawn when he was flying his kite, but I brought her indoors.

01:33.000 --> 01:38.000
I said, who needs electricity when we're fucking?

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
I don't know.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
Yeah, I just, it doesn't really, I think.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
What if you could get fucked by anybody's mom?

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
Let's say the mom was doing the fucking on you.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
You're like famous moms.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
A famous mom just chose you.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
You're the target.

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
Yo, Mrs. Whistler, why are you fucking me so hard?

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
It's only one famous mother ever.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
Alright, let's cut it.

02:03.000 --> 02:12.000
We're not going to, the only thing worse than a low energy show is a forced resistance to a low energy show with a terrible rap.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
I can't believe you only think there's only one famous mother.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
Name another famous mother.

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
Mrs. Doubtfire.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
The original.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
Mrs. C from Happy Days.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
Alright.

02:25.000 --> 02:32.000
Start the beat again, and let's say you're getting fucked by Mrs. Cunningham from Happy Days, or you're fucking anybody in Happy Days.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
Hit the beat.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
Wait, I'm...

02:34.000 --> 02:46.000
Dan, don't fight me on this.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
I'm Mrs. Cunningham.

02:47.000 --> 02:52.000
C-U-N-N-I-G-I-G-H-A-M.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
Say it again.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
Spell it one more time.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
Mrs. Cunningham.

02:57.000 --> 03:02.000
C-U-N-N-I-G-I-H-G-I-G-I-M.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
Mrs. Cunningham.

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
I make a stunning ham for Thanksgiving.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
I make more than that.

03:08.000 --> 03:15.000
I'm always in the kitchen with a clit the size of a bat.

03:15.000 --> 03:20.000
It might be a penis.

03:20.000 --> 03:25.000
I might have a dick when we're getting to that size.

03:25.000 --> 03:33.000
And I don't know why I'm...

03:33.000 --> 03:37.000
Are you saying that Marion Ross has a clit the size of a bat?

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
No, it's the character.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
Or the character of Mrs. Cunningham.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
Yeah.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
Alright.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
We've had enough like that.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
Thank you.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
We've had enough.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
The rap's not getting better as the suggestions get harder.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
It kinda was.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
Alright, now do it.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
No, I'm not saying we should continue, but that was great.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
That was fucking...

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
That was inflammatory.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
Yeah, it got bad.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
It got problematic.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
When I'm at this energy level,

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
we don't wanna like force me to do tricks

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
because then I'm gonna end up like...

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
I'll say the n-word before the night's over.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
I'm so tired.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
I don't have any resistance.

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
The whole point of the genre is to break boundaries.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
I know, but it's not...

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
No, no.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
That's what you said before I played the Chevy Chase voicemail.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
That just didn't help anyone.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
What I said before I played the Chevy Chase voicemail

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
was, Dan, do you want to play it off my phone?

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
Because I can plug it in over here.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
You guys didn't have plugs back then.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
Come on.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
So anyways...

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
Oh, okay.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
I mean, there's nothing to get to.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
There's no show to do.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
I was thinking we might play D&D for like two hours tonight.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
Let's do it.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
I'm just not feeling...

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
You know, part of it is the video game brain.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
Like, I was playing...

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
I was having a good time at home.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
I played video games.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
I played Star Wars Battlefront.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
Oh, yeah.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
I was thinking about that one.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
So good, man.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
It's really fun.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
Oh, yeah.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
It reminds me...

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
What was the name?

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
You're probably too young even to remember.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
Like, yeah.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
There was an original...

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
There was like a game that was...

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
I think it was Dark Forces,

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
where you're like a dude that's like a Jedi.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
You're not Luke Skywalker,

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
but you're just like this dude that's a Jedi.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
And there's like...

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
Say what?

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
Kyle Katarn.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
Oh, Kyle Katarn is the name of the dude.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
Is it Force Rising?

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
Yeah, it was like a...

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
It was like one of my first PC games,

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
and it was like on a CD-ROM,

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
and it had like all this shitty video...

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
Excuse me.

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
Video footage of like, you know,

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
actors that were probably getting like $300 to be covered

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
in prosthetics against green screens,

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
and like come out,

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
and like the cutscenes were all video.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
That was a special era in gaming.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
But it was a really good game,

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
because it was like...

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
I think that was like the first time you ever got to like,

05:48.000 --> 05:52.000
in a first-person shooter from Lucasfilm,

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
you were like using a lightsaber,

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
and you were like leveling up these force powers.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
So, this game is...

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
It's not...

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
The focus isn't on that,

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
or as I only played like the first third of it or something,

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
like, but you're like this woman

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
who's a special forces stormtrooper.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
It's really cool.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
It's just the gameplay is like a really nice balance

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
of like you can just dick around

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
and like jump and fucking shoot,

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
and like it just splits the perfect difference

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
between like games where like Wolfenstein 2,

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
like I'm 44, so I just opened Wolfenstein 2,

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
and I was like,

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
I played a couple levels,

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
and I'm like this is cool,

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
but it's not...

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
I'm never going to enjoy this game,

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
because it's just going to be like running and gunning,

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
and I'm never going to be good,

06:35.000 --> 06:39.000
and I'm always going to be bummed out and anxious.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
And then there's,

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
on the other side of the spectrum,

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
there's like games that are so role-play

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
that you're just like walking around,

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
having conversations with people,

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
and you kind of get bored,

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
but like right in the middle there,

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
it's really nice, really good gameplay.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
You just like...

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
I like those,

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
I like those shooters where like you,

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
you touch the left trigger,

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
and if you're close enough to the person's head,

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
it like zooms in on their head,

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
and you shoot them in the head.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
This probably has an inappropriate time

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
in our nation's history to be...

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
No, it's great.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
But I mean, I should probably...

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
I should probably wait six days

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
and play the market,

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
and hope that we're seven days from a mass shooting.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
Yeah, no shootings will happen.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
But anyways,

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
it's a really good game.

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
Battlefront 2, I recommend it.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
What platform is it on?

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
I'm playing it on my Xbox.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
I don't know what it's all on.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
And then another game that I saw,

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
I stayed up all night playing that,

07:36.000 --> 07:41.000
and then the game that I played all day today

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
was Portal Knights.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
Have you heard of Portal Knights?

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
No.

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
It's like somebody looked at Minecraft and thought,

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
this isn't...

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
Portals.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
This isn't comfy enough.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
It's like a very polished,

07:56.000 --> 08:00.000
like, adventure-y RPG kind of Minecraft thing.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
Oh yeah, okay.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
That's cool.

08:02.000 --> 08:07.000
I got sucked in pretty hard.

08:07.000 --> 08:11.000
And so because I had a good time playing video games today,

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
it does something to your brain,

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
like it fucks up your alpha waves or something.

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
You never play video games like that,

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
but you hate that.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
The only games I really liked was the first-person shooter,

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
like historical ones, like Call of Duty's

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
and Medal of Honor's and stuff.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
You'd love Battlefront.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
Battlefront?

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
Yeah.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
Battlefront.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
Here's the thing that's great about the Star Wars games,

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
when they're done right.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
There's a bunch of shitty ones,

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
because there's a bunch of Lucasfilm games,

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
but the really good ones, it's so cool.

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
Just having the John Williams score playing

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
while you're playing a shooter,

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
and especially if it's a good enough game

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
that it kind of...

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
It comes in and out.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
Well, it uses the music to...

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
When you aggro a stormtrooper,

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
it turns into a little...

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
Yeah.

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
And then you finish shooting all the stormtroopers

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
in the area, and it kind of just very gracefully

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
goes into this more wistful...

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
You know, I've been playing chess with friends.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
Oh, I've been seeing some of your moves.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
Chess with friends?

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
Yeah, it's like words with friends, but it's chess.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
And I was at the drawing room, and a cat comes up to me,

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
and he goes, he saw me sitting there

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
playing chess with somebody else, like on my phone.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
And he's a Harmontown fan.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
His name escapes me.

09:27.000 --> 09:30.000
His name is, like, online, something like Cap Slap,

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
or Slappy Clappy.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
Slapping Cap.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
And I'm going to beat that motherfucker.

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
I was playing that for a little bit,

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
but it just takes so long.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
It's like chess by mail.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
Well, yeah, it depends on your playing.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
Some people play really fast, you know,

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
but I don't want to have to play, like,

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
speed chess with somebody.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
Yeah, for sure.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
Yeah.

09:50.000 --> 09:54.000
I would need it to be a zero-sum speed chess.

09:54.000 --> 10:00.000
Even if I could remember how all the horsies move,

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
like, which I can't, I would have to have it be speed chess,

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
and I would always lose.

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
But I would at least need the excuse to, like, make a move.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
Right.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
Because my understanding of chess is, like,

10:10.000 --> 10:14.000
well, theoretically, you could sit there forever.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
Like, so why wouldn't you?

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
Like, chess freaks me out.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
Well, the people I play tend to, like,

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
a few of the people I play are from the drawing room,

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
and so I can tell when somebody's drunk when they're playing me

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
because they make a bullshit move,

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
and they also know when I'm drunk

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
and I've made a bullshit move.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
And sometimes I go, I want to win this one.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
I'm going to go to sleep,

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
and I'm going to play them in the morning.

10:33.000 --> 10:37.000
And it's improving my brain.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
Damn.

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
I mean, a note of anything at all.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
My contentment and also my kind of, like,

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
you know, it's part contentment and part, like,

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
I just don't like the world anymore.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
I don't trust people.

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
I don't have faith in humanity anymore.

10:52.000 --> 10:56.000
So I kind of just, let's see if I did bother

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
to write anything down throughout the week.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
I can feel the subscriptions dropping,

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
which is fine.

11:02.000 --> 11:06.000
That's democracy.

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
When you said Mrs. C's clip was the size of a bat,

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
were you talking about baseball bat,

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
like Louisville Slugger,

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
or were you talking about, like, a fruit bat?

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
A vampire bat?

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
No, no.

11:16.000 --> 11:21.000
I meant a stick, a big, long stick.

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
That's pretty big.

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
Let's say you were on a date with Mrs. Cunningham,

11:27.000 --> 11:31.000
and you lifted up her skirt, and you saw her clip.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
Would you rather it be the size of a baseball bat,

11:33.000 --> 11:37.000
or did you want her to look exactly like a vampire bat?

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
I don't want.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
I mean, I don't know if this is going to go over well.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
I'm giving you a choice.

11:43.000 --> 11:47.000
I don't want, if you're a woman, listener, subscriber,

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
and you have an enlarged clitoris,

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
I don't want you to, I'm not,

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
you should feel good about yourself.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
I have all kinds of things about my body

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
that you can take or leave,

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
but you're asking me the question.

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
I don't want a giant,

12:03.000 --> 12:06.000
I don't want a clitoris that's bigger than my penis.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
I'm a woman.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
Would you be more credible?

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
That basically is a penis.

12:09.000 --> 12:12.000
What if her clitoris looked like a bat?

12:12.000 --> 12:15.000
Like a fruit bat, or a vampire bat.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
It looked like a batman.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
No, I mean, that would be crazy.

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
That would be distracting and crazy.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
I'm giving you the choice.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
I'm saying you got a point.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
No, you're trying to help the show, but...

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
I'm trying to ask a journalistic question, Dan,

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
that I think a lot of people want to know the answer to.

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
What does Dan Harmon feel about baseball bat clits

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
or fruit bat clits?

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
Same way on both counts.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
Just, you know what?

12:42.000 --> 12:46.000
As politically unfashionable as it is right now,

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
I'll just go ahead and say it

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
because I'm being asked the question.

12:49.000 --> 12:53.000
Anomalous clitoris?

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
All right, give me a beat.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
Yo.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
Zach, put it...

12:58.000 --> 13:02.000
I got high hopes for this one.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
Yo.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
Yo.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
Right about now,

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
it's time for Anomalous Clitoris.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
Bring him to the stage.

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
Hello?

13:15.000 --> 13:18.000
Hello?

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
I'm Anomalous Clitoris.

13:20.000 --> 13:26.000
I'm here to say I'm making a big scene today.

13:26.000 --> 13:30.000
I'm a new kind of rapper that you've never seen.

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
Anomalous Clitoris is not where you've been

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
and if you don't like things that are new

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
then you need to step aside

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
because the world's getting smaller

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
and the clitoris is getting wide.

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
Anomalous, a clitoris,

13:44.000 --> 13:48.000
it's not the clitoris that you can predict,

13:48.000 --> 13:53.000
but that's why the price of this is...

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
Thank you.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
I just felt like Anomalous Clitoris

14:02.000 --> 14:07.000
is a good 2018 rap name.

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000
I still can't find Balder Dash cards.

14:13.000 --> 14:18.000
I was looking for weeks.

14:18.000 --> 14:23.000
You know, if you did want

14:23.000 --> 14:27.000
rap to be good,

14:27.000 --> 14:30.000
there's a person in the empty warehouse

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
that's just visiting

14:32.000 --> 14:37.000
who you played their rap a couple of episodes ago.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
Are you talking about Rob Tanchum?

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
He did the Fuck Your Mama rap

14:42.000 --> 14:45.000
that we kind of applauded.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
Yeah, it's a big hit.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
And he came out and he visited.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
I don't want to spoil too much,

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
but we laid down some tracks with him.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
We don't know what we're doing.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
Can we say what those tracks are?

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
Should we keep those a secret?

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
It seemed like it's so important.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
I just would say...

15:03.000 --> 15:06.000
I don't think it blows it to say...

15:06.000 --> 15:11.000
he felt the need or the compulsion

15:11.000 --> 15:15.000
to write a Pringles Dick rap.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
Yeah, well, he's kind of a...

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
he's a really good rap writer.

15:19.000 --> 15:22.000
And he wrote a giraffe rap that knocks my socks off.

15:22.000 --> 15:25.000
And it was on assignment,

15:25.000 --> 15:28.000
which I don't respond well to people going,

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
like, well, why don't you make it about this?

15:30.000 --> 15:33.000
But he was in town,

15:33.000 --> 15:36.000
and I was doing a different thing.

15:36.000 --> 15:39.000
We're going to be putting out a little tape.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
That's a tease.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
I'll tease it that much.

15:43.000 --> 15:48.000
And so I had said to Mr. Tangem,

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
who's visiting,

15:50.000 --> 15:53.000
if you did have any kind of

15:53.000 --> 15:57.000
lyrical thoughts about giraffes,

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
love them, hate them,

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
maybe you are a giraffe,

16:01.000 --> 16:05.000
then you're like, we could maybe slide you into this

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
other stupid thing that I'm doing.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
What I'm doing is not that brilliant.

16:09.000 --> 16:12.000
It's just for fans of the podcast.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
It might be a little treat.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
Should we bring him up?

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
Let's bring Rob Tanchum up.

16:18.000 --> 16:29.000
Rob Tanchum to the stage, please.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
Everybody, meet Rob.

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
Hello, Rob.

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
So like a consummate rapper, Dan,

16:37.000 --> 16:40.000
you've developed a crew that you now roll with,

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
and he's in it, right? Is that correct?

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
I guess he's part of your crew.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
You're rolling deep.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
Would you say you have a posse now?

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
I don't know. It's hard to say,

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
because I don't know that what I do is really,

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000
I'm kind of a performance artist still, I think.

16:53.000 --> 16:56.000
I haven't taken pen to paper ever.

16:56.000 --> 17:01.000
Rob went back to where he's staying.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
I wanted to say hotel,

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
but that's factually inaccurate.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
You're staying with a friend.

17:05.000 --> 17:10.000
But that's the time frame.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
On day one of his visit,

17:12.000 --> 17:16.000
I was like, why don't you, if you want to write

17:16.000 --> 17:20.000
like a giraffe verse,

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
maybe we can record that tomorrow,

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
because we'll both be in the studio.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
And then he went home and then he came back

17:26.000 --> 17:30.000
and he had all kinds of shit, including this,

17:30.000 --> 17:33.000
and we did record it,

17:33.000 --> 17:36.000
but I thought it would be, since we have the beat,

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
do we have the beat?

17:38.000 --> 17:41.000
If you're prepared to wrap it,

17:41.000 --> 17:46.000
since, why not offset my particularly bad evening

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
for me freestyle-wise with, look,

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
if good rap is what you want.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
I think you're being too hard on yourself, Dan.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
I think because we don't have the live audience here,

17:54.000 --> 17:57.000
you don't get that feedback from...

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
I think the people right now

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
are shouting at their laptops.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
That's not true.

18:02.000 --> 18:05.000
Some of his best rapping has been recently.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
But this wasn't it?

18:07.000 --> 18:10.000
This wasn't bad, but certainly not the heights.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
It's video games, I think,

18:12.000 --> 18:16.000
fry the part of your brain that you used to rap, kids.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
I'm not a doctor.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
I don't play video games.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
Don't play video games.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
That's your secret.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
That's your secret.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
But you also don't really freestyle.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
I mean, we don't...

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
I mean, it's not your...

18:25.000 --> 18:28.000
No, I practiced earlier in case, you know,

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
there was a need to freestyle.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
I wanted to, like, exercise that muscle beforehand,

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
because we never got to...

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
Let's do that, then.

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
Well, let's do it.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
Because we talked about trading fours,

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
because we were in the booth at the same time.

18:40.000 --> 18:43.000
We did an improv, but we never freestyle together.

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
So I was just ready for it.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
I don't want to, you know...

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
I think that...

18:47.000 --> 18:50.000
I'd like the kids to hear your giraffe rap, I think.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
Yeah.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
Would you do the same thing that you did?

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
Zach, you got that beat?

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
No.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
I'm not going to, because I don't want to step on it.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
I just want people to listen.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
And you don't worry about performance.

19:00.000 --> 19:04.000
Just eat the mic and make sure they hear your delicious lyrics

19:04.000 --> 19:07.000
that you wrote overnight having been assigned

19:07.000 --> 19:10.000
the task of writing about giraffes.

19:10.000 --> 19:14.000
Yeah, because Dan has a long, weird relationship with...

19:14.000 --> 19:17.000
I would say love hate, but just hate hate on giraffes.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
No, I hate giraffes.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
You hate giraffes.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
Yeah.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
Can I adopt that for this one?

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
Yeah.

19:22.000 --> 19:26.000
Well, because there's an existing track of you doing...

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
A giraffe rap.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
Giraffe rap.

19:28.000 --> 19:31.000
Well, I don't want to ruin your giraffe rap, eating a leaf.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
Yeah.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
You know, reaching real high to get up to my tree.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
Yeah.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
You can listen to it in the archives.

19:36.000 --> 19:39.000
Yeah, and it's actually one of the more awkward freestyles

19:39.000 --> 19:42.000
I've ever done, because I rhymed Darwin with hard win.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.000
That's great.

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
Which is very funny.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
And you could have said Harmon.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
Harmon, yeah.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
I could have said Harmon.

19:47.000 --> 19:51.000
You could have said...

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
Did you just shit your pants?

19:53.000 --> 19:56.000
No, I committed to not finishing the sentence.

19:56.000 --> 20:02.000
All right, well, let's just at you when you feel ready.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
Now, how about this?

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
Can I make a picture?

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
Because you're going to do your rap.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
Sure.

20:07.000 --> 20:13.000
When it's done, like when your rap is through, Dan, why don't you go into some extemporaneous

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
freestyle giraffe?

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
Well, I'll tell you the answer is because obviously, as we've established, I'm not really on my

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
game tonight.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
Well, so...

20:19.000 --> 20:23.000
Look, I'm not saying that if you do a bad job, the show is going to end.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
Okay, but let's just...

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
I'm giving you an opportunity.

20:25.000 --> 20:29.000
Let's just do the thing we said we were going to do.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
Well, let's simplify it.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
Instead of data, you can rap about clitoris.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
Okay.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
Yes.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
And a Russian accent.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
Okay.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
It's going to be great.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.400
As long as we just keep pimping me, it'll become a great show.

20:38.400 --> 20:40.000
I will become talented.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.000
He's working.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
I will become enthusiastic.

20:42.000 --> 20:48.000
My brain chemistry will completely change if we just keep making me do stuff.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
All right.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
I agree.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
Let's...

20:51.000 --> 20:57.000
When you're ready, you cue him, and then let's listen to this.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
Yo.

20:58.000 --> 21:02.000
And then in the track, there's a lot of...

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
Rob Tanchum.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
That's very exciting to me.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.000
Okay.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
Yo.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
Yeah.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
Giraffe rap.

21:09.000 --> 21:10.000
Rapping giraffe facts.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
Interested in info on giraffes?

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
Well, I have that.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
Fuck what you heard.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
Drafts are the worst.

21:14.000 --> 21:17.000
Hopefully one day they will be purged from the earth.

21:17.000 --> 21:20.000
No one's ever seen a giraffe go swimming.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
It's a legitimate draft fact.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
No kidding.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
If you chew a bath, the giraffe won't get it.

21:24.000 --> 21:27.000
And bunch of tall assholes don't know what they're missing.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
Tend a whole goddamn day eating leaves.

21:29.000 --> 21:32.000
80 pounds worth to fulfill the dietary needs.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
No time for hobbies.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
No skis or trophies.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
No leisurely evenings.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
No reason to be.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
Barely even sleep.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
Ten minute intervals.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
Standing straight up.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
Straight up imbeciles.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
Only vertebrate species that can't gong.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
When they're all gone, I'm a feel invincible.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
Drink water once every few days.

21:43.000 --> 21:53.000
Learning draft facts fills my veins with rage.

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
They're not like me.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
I don't like that.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.000
Drafts aren't human.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
Drafts can't write drafts.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
Drafts make no sound.

21:59.000 --> 22:02.000
Not because they can, but because they choose not to.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
What?

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
That's a fact I found.

22:04.000 --> 22:05.000
Fuck a smug herbivores.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
If I could, I would fight you.

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
Fuck giraffes.

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
All right.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
Thank you.

22:10.000 --> 22:13.000
Big clitorises.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
Anomalous clitoris.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
Take it over.

22:17.000 --> 22:21.000
If you see a horse with a very long neck.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
Anomalous clitoris is now on deck.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
I'm a zookeeper of science.

22:25.000 --> 22:32.000
I drop it mad and I don't know why it's so hard to have a foot this big.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.000
Check out my rig.

22:33.000 --> 22:36.000
It's an 18 wheel truck.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
Anomalous clitoris is hard to fuck.

22:38.000 --> 22:45.000
You don't know where to put your wiener when the clitoris is far less leaner.

22:45.000 --> 22:46.000
Can we stop?

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
I was just making the joke.

22:48.000 --> 22:53.000
It's just not the right time in our nation's history.

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
It's not the right time.

22:55.000 --> 22:58.000
You really ran with it more than I expected.

22:58.000 --> 23:01.000
You're a real sport and that should be commended.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
Yeah.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
How about those shirts?

23:03.000 --> 23:07.000
Are you saying that it's a real giraffe fact that giraffes can make sounds but they

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
choose not to?

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
This is the phrasing of it.

23:09.000 --> 23:12.000
Giraffes don't make sounds.

23:12.000 --> 23:18.000
I did a Google perusing but giraffes don't make sounds.

23:18.000 --> 23:21.000
Not because they can't but because they choose not to.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
It's infuriating.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
They have the capacity to make.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
They have vocal cords that could make a sound.

23:27.000 --> 23:31.000
I guess according to discovery kids or discovery adults or whatever fact.

23:31.000 --> 23:35.000
I go to discovery kids for all of my facts.

23:35.000 --> 23:41.000
They have the capacity to make a noise but they're like why?

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
I'm a fucking giraffe.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
What am I going to do?

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
Say hey there's some leaves over here?

23:47.000 --> 23:53.000
They have no reason to make any noise because they have to because they require, I rounded

23:53.000 --> 24:00.000
up to 80 for the lyric but it was 75 or over pounds of food a day and because they're eating

24:00.000 --> 24:05.000
leaves and their drafts they have to spend all day eating so there's nothing else.

24:05.000 --> 24:06.000
They don't have a reason.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
They can't waste those calories on talking shit.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
They got to eat those leaves.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
I've never asked myself this question.

24:12.000 --> 24:21.000
Giraffes I'm assuming they're like in the same biomes, biomes that I'm assuming their

24:21.000 --> 24:27.000
predators are like big cats like your Puma's and your Jaguar's.

24:27.000 --> 24:33.000
People only fuck with the young giraffes because the big giraffes will just kung fu.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
They'll kick the fuck out of you.

24:35.000 --> 24:38.000
Do you know that?

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
There's videos where they kick.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
I think giraffes will kick.

24:42.000 --> 24:46.000
So if a tiger sees a giraffe or a lion they'll go like wow.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
They don't fuck with a full grown giraffe even a pack of them.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
The giraffe will A. outrun them.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
Outrun them?

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
No they're fast.

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
They're fastest shit.

24:53.000 --> 24:56.000
And if they kick you you're done.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
They'll break your jaw.

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
You can't eat anymore.

24:59.000 --> 25:02.000
You're a dead tiger or a dead lion rather.

25:02.000 --> 25:07.000
If they fucking give you one karate chop with one of their hoofs you've just located

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
something and you can't operate anymore.

25:09.000 --> 25:12.000
So the big cats know not to fuck with a full grown giraffe.

25:12.000 --> 25:15.000
Well now we know why they don't choose to make sounds.

25:15.000 --> 25:20.000
I mean they're like the Winston Churchill's of their bodies made of big sticks.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.000
Right.

25:21.000 --> 25:26.000
Well if the body was made of big sticks.

25:26.000 --> 25:29.000
They would speak even more than softly.

25:29.000 --> 25:32.000
Or would they be allowed to speak more softly because they're just one.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
They're always carrying.

25:33.000 --> 25:34.000
There's four giants.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.000
Oh have you seen them fight?

25:35.000 --> 25:41.000
The rest of the Churchill put it says speak softly carry a big stick and it's dot dot dot.

25:41.000 --> 25:44.000
And if your body's made of giant sticks don't speak at all.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
Have you seen them fucking fight each other?

25:46.000 --> 25:47.000
They just go like.

25:47.000 --> 25:48.000
They wank.

25:48.000 --> 25:49.000
It's called necking.

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
It's crazy.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
They club each other.

25:52.000 --> 25:55.000
And Churchill I think you pointed out to me that they have the same amount of vertebrae.

25:55.000 --> 25:56.000
They have the same.

25:56.000 --> 25:57.000
They have seven vertebrae.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
They're just.

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
In their necks.

25:59.000 --> 26:02.000
They're just long ass vertebrae.

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
They're like extravert.

26:04.000 --> 26:07.000
Extravertebrae.

26:07.000 --> 26:10.000
If Schrab was here he'd launch a whole comic book.

26:10.000 --> 26:13.000
Extravertebrae.

26:13.000 --> 26:17.000
There's a giraffe with eight vertebrae in his neck and like dies.

26:17.000 --> 26:23.000
Not to remove the joy from my hatred of giraffes which is just you know like it's because it's

26:23.000 --> 26:28.000
obviously it's like that's the thing that we learn about in evolution is like that's

26:28.000 --> 26:32.000
that's an illustration of Darwinian evolution is that you slowly get along your neck.

26:32.000 --> 26:39.000
And it's like not how humans roll like we didn't we didn't our bodies didn't morph to

26:39.000 --> 26:40.000
suit our surroundings.

26:40.000 --> 26:45.000
We we became we became hackers of the environment.

26:45.000 --> 26:50.000
Maybe trees I mean maybe trees got taller because of other animals like the trees and

26:50.000 --> 26:51.000
the giraffes were meeting each other.

26:51.000 --> 26:56.000
That's just one reason why you don't want to go the long neck root.

26:56.000 --> 27:00.000
I like like don't don't play footsie with Mother Earth.

27:00.000 --> 27:03.000
Like fucking get down to roll up your sleeves.

27:03.000 --> 27:11.000
She's been trying to kill you for fucking eight billion years man fucking take a piece.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
I'm not a conservative.

27:13.000 --> 27:14.000
I'm not saying drill baby drill.

27:14.000 --> 27:17.000
Who do you think is the most efficient animal in the animal kingdom.

27:17.000 --> 27:20.000
You're obviously not giraffes but who is the most efficient animal.

27:20.000 --> 27:24.000
Who is the most Darwinian efficient design.

27:24.000 --> 27:28.000
Well I'm supposed to say cockroach because they survived the nuclear whatever but but

27:28.000 --> 27:32.000
I mean forgetting about that nuclear holocaust thing which I don't know how much of that

27:32.000 --> 27:35.000
is apocryphal or whatever you call it.

27:35.000 --> 27:42.000
I feel like ants are yeah because they they're they're basically dirt that moves.

27:42.000 --> 27:56.000
They they they've combined individual life form and colony and and and and yes through

27:56.000 --> 28:09.000
the colonial technique like they it doesn't matter if one of them dies and yet they just

28:09.000 --> 28:12.000
don't know it's it's kind of amazing what they do those little guys.

28:12.000 --> 28:16.000
That's an interesting answer in comparison to drafts because one of the draft facts that

28:16.000 --> 28:22.000
I learned is that they have no societal hierarchy or structure or anything.

28:22.000 --> 28:23.000
They're the opposite of ants.

28:23.000 --> 28:26.000
They're just they're they're they're free form.

28:26.000 --> 28:27.000
Oh man.

28:27.000 --> 28:31.000
I knew this was going to happen if we start if I actually ever researched drafts I knew

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
I would fall in love with them.

28:33.000 --> 28:38.000
I have I have one big one that they sound like the dolphin of the desert.

28:38.000 --> 28:44.000
I think that I think that's what I can't.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
I didn't want to episode title.

28:46.000 --> 28:53.000
It didn't make it into the rap but there's a very interesting one was that before mating

28:53.000 --> 28:57.000
a female giraffe will urinate into the male drafts mouth.

28:57.000 --> 28:58.000
How does he get down there?

28:58.000 --> 28:59.000
I don't know.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.000
I don't know.

29:00.000 --> 29:01.000
It's got a long neck.

29:01.000 --> 29:04.000
Well because they're all these things where they can't reach the ground.

29:04.000 --> 29:05.000
They can't really sit.

29:05.000 --> 29:08.000
But that's that's part of it and I didn't want to I didn't want to bring it in into

29:08.000 --> 29:09.000
a negative context.

29:09.000 --> 29:12.000
The female giraffe peas in the male drafts mouth.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.000
Yeah.

29:13.000 --> 29:14.000
And that's courtship.

29:14.000 --> 29:15.000
Oh yeah.

29:15.000 --> 29:16.000
Yeah baby.

29:16.000 --> 29:21.000
Yeah I think it's to taste fertility taste fertile giraffes taste fertility.

29:21.000 --> 29:25.000
She said she said welcome to flavor country.

29:25.000 --> 29:29.000
She's saying I'm ready.

29:29.000 --> 29:34.000
Let me pee in your mouth and taste whether or not you want to fuck me.

29:34.000 --> 29:37.000
I mean that definitely is like the opposite of ants.

29:37.000 --> 29:38.000
Right.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
Because it's like there's no there's no power dynamic there.

29:40.000 --> 29:44.000
I mean we think well whoever's getting their mouth peed in is on bottom.

29:44.000 --> 29:48.000
But I mean first of all these are giraffes.

29:48.000 --> 29:49.000
No one's on bottom.

29:49.000 --> 29:50.000
There's no bottom.

29:50.000 --> 29:53.000
They get their heads like in the clouds.

29:53.000 --> 29:58.000
But but but it's also like like wait so she it's it's it's the down and drinks for

29:58.000 --> 29:59.000
pee.

29:59.000 --> 30:00.000
I didn't see a diagram.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.000
I didn't see any type of pill.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
Does she pee in a puddle and he laps up the puddle.

30:03.000 --> 30:06.000
Yeah she pees in a puddle and he laps it up for real.

30:06.000 --> 30:09.000
No that's stupid.

30:09.000 --> 30:14.000
I'm assuming that she said she jet that it jets like it goes up.

30:14.000 --> 30:17.000
He doesn't even bend down that it's like what's like a ping pong.

30:17.000 --> 30:18.000
It goes that far up.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
She can shoot pee in the air.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
Well what I love about that is it's all voluntary.

30:22.000 --> 30:23.000
Everything has agency.

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
Every the guy the girl.

30:25.000 --> 30:28.000
She's just like yeah don't mind me.

30:28.000 --> 30:32.000
But if anyone's interested like like like check out what's for sale.

30:32.000 --> 30:35.000
Look I choose not to talk.

30:35.000 --> 30:38.000
I'm not a man with words.

30:38.000 --> 30:42.000
I you know like let's just simplify things pee in my mouth.

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
Let me taste whether or not.

30:44.000 --> 30:48.000
And then you can like wander by and like take a slurp like it's from in Milwaukee what

30:48.000 --> 30:53.000
we call a bubbler and and you sip it and then you go like good morning Margaret and

30:53.000 --> 30:56.000
then you just keep walking like she's not offended.

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
You know like if you're not into it.

30:58.000 --> 31:03.000
If you're like you know what I I'm going to if I was a female giraffe and peed in some

31:03.000 --> 31:08.000
but some gentleman's mouth and he just walked by I'd be very offended.

31:08.000 --> 31:12.000
I would say well what's my peas not good enough for you.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
Well how do you go back and get nervous.

31:14.000 --> 31:18.000
I would leave the room and like I would pee in the mouth because I walked in on you peeing.

31:18.000 --> 31:19.000
You did.

31:19.000 --> 31:24.000
You did and I did get I admitted to you being a peeshaw and I stopped peeing.

31:24.000 --> 31:30.000
I was I he was already peeing in the urinal at star burns I went into the stall the stall.

31:30.000 --> 31:31.000
Yeah.

31:31.000 --> 31:35.000
Peed came out and you were kind of like and you but you walked in you said excited to

31:35.000 --> 31:36.000
hear that giraffe rap.

31:36.000 --> 31:41.000
Yeah I said I said hello how do you do I thought you were either mid or post pee.

31:41.000 --> 31:46.000
And then I was washing my hands and you were bravely admitted.

31:46.000 --> 31:50.000
I did that thing where I didn't pee because you scared me when you walked in.

31:50.000 --> 31:58.000
Here's what I like about the pee tasting design sexually as a courtship ritual.

31:58.000 --> 32:02.000
There is no I'm saying like it's happening behind her.

32:02.000 --> 32:06.000
She's peeing it's she's she's facing this way.

32:06.000 --> 32:12.000
So is it you just pee and then whoever's behind you just takes it takes a taste like

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
they're at a wine party.

32:14.000 --> 32:17.000
You think the guy sneak attack pee tasting or is she peeing.

32:17.000 --> 32:20.000
She said hey come over here I want to pee in your mouth.

32:20.000 --> 32:21.000
Well I don't.

32:21.000 --> 32:22.000
This is.

32:22.000 --> 32:27.000
I'm picturing a jet of pee so I don't think I'd be surprised.

32:27.000 --> 32:30.000
He said the female peas in the male's mouth.

32:30.000 --> 32:31.000
We all thought the same thing.

32:31.000 --> 32:34.000
How is that even physically possible they're giraffes.

32:34.000 --> 32:39.000
So then I went to well maybe it's like a jet coming out of her nether is like going arcing

32:39.000 --> 32:44.000
into the air and then it made me think of like a garden hose like at a fun party where

32:44.000 --> 32:45.000
like it doesn't matter.

32:45.000 --> 32:50.000
There's enough for everyone and like and that and that and that that way like there could

32:50.000 --> 32:56.000
be like several males like walking by and they just like take a nibble you know of it.

32:56.000 --> 33:00.000
Like maybe that's just say let's say I'm designing a perfect species here.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
I'm not I don't know what giraffes do.

33:02.000 --> 33:10.000
We're almost there like like like the woman peas in a in a giant arc and if you don't

33:10.000 --> 33:13.000
want to get peed on you don't go near there.

33:13.000 --> 33:19.000
Yeah but also I don't think in this species culture there's a lot of P phobia but but

33:19.000 --> 33:26.000
but you if you're in the vicinity of a woman who's peeing you you walk through it like

33:26.000 --> 33:27.000
a sprinkler.

33:27.000 --> 33:32.000
You can pretend you didn't taste anything that's not offensive to her.

33:32.000 --> 33:38.000
You just walk through it and go tap of the morning Sheila and but if it's you know if

33:38.000 --> 33:45.000
you if you get something on your tongue that's like she's she is like dropping a thousand

33:45.000 --> 33:46.000
eggs today.

33:46.000 --> 33:49.000
I don't know how you measure fertility.

33:49.000 --> 33:57.000
She is fecund and then and then and you're like you know and I'm kind of I'm a little

33:57.000 --> 34:05.000
riled up myself truth be told and then you circle around and you say Sheila you're you're

34:05.000 --> 34:08.000
positively glowing today.

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
Your urine is on my face.

34:10.000 --> 34:16.000
It tastes like you're you'd make a baby giraffe without me.

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
Want to make one with me.

34:18.000 --> 34:23.000
I'm assuming then she goes she can say yes or no and it's just like it's checks and balances

34:23.000 --> 34:29.000
you know we wouldn't have any of these problems and then if if if if he is just perfecting

34:29.000 --> 34:35.000
the species if she rebukes him she's like I'd rather be with Stanley than you Donald.

34:35.000 --> 34:43.000
The guy could go all right and he can block her exit and jerk off into a potted plant.

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
That's the perfect species.

34:45.000 --> 34:48.000
Just to just to psychologically torture her and then we're done perfect.

34:48.000 --> 34:49.000
I'm kidding.

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
Jesus Christ.

34:51.000 --> 34:54.000
Everybody's laughing at every other dumb fucking thing.

34:54.000 --> 34:55.000
I'm sorry.

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
I looked it up.

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
It's definitely an act.

34:59.000 --> 35:02.000
It's not like a but there's a picture.

35:02.000 --> 35:09.000
There's a church has footage of giraffes being on people.

35:09.000 --> 35:12.000
Like a bubbler.

35:12.000 --> 35:15.000
That almost looks like a giraffe drinking its own pee.

35:15.000 --> 35:20.000
How bendy are those necks?

35:20.000 --> 35:21.000
It's like they're drinking.

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
It's got to be so tired.

35:23.000 --> 35:28.000
It's like in the Lion King where everyone's around the watering hole and all the different

35:28.000 --> 35:33.000
you know and then there's the drafts and they bend down and drink out of the communal just

35:33.000 --> 35:34.000
they bend down.

35:34.000 --> 35:35.000
I haven't seen it.

35:35.000 --> 35:36.000
Lion King.

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
That's the main part of it.

35:38.000 --> 35:39.000
Lion King.

35:39.000 --> 35:40.000
It's mostly about giraffes.

35:40.000 --> 35:45.000
So a giraffe sees a male giraffe sees a female giraffe taking a pee.

35:45.000 --> 35:49.000
No it's it's a it's a it's a it's a ritual.

35:49.000 --> 35:50.000
It's a ritual.

35:50.000 --> 35:51.000
It's like rubbing a neck.

35:51.000 --> 35:57.000
So when they're courting she's like all right hey do yourself a favor get get around here

35:57.000 --> 36:00.000
get around the back end of this action.

36:00.000 --> 36:03.000
What the fuck can pee on you.

36:03.000 --> 36:09.000
Every other species is like it's like somebody's just you know like like somebody's just you

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
know being coerced.

36:11.000 --> 36:12.000
Yeah.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
I like sprinkler pee.

36:14.000 --> 36:18.000
So are you on team giraffe now or I like the way they do some stuff.

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
I like that they stomp tigers.

36:20.000 --> 36:25.000
I like that they're an herbivore that tigers are afraid of.

36:25.000 --> 36:29.000
You know maybe the lions or maybe that long neck ain't so dumb.

36:29.000 --> 36:30.000
Yeah.

36:30.000 --> 36:35.000
I mean they whack each other like they really hurt each other by just swinging their giant

36:35.000 --> 36:36.000
ass head.

36:36.000 --> 36:39.000
They're like I forgot how much they weighed.

36:39.000 --> 36:42.000
I mean that really did learn some giraffe facts.

36:42.000 --> 36:45.000
They're those are fatal fatal blows.

36:45.000 --> 36:48.000
They're like I'm going to say like they're 70 pound necks.

36:48.000 --> 36:49.000
They're crazy.

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
But that's not the right number.

36:51.000 --> 36:55.000
But they must get like neck problems all the time you'd think right.

36:55.000 --> 36:59.000
Like if they're whacking people with their necks like that would knock your vertebrae

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
out of alignment you'd think.

37:01.000 --> 37:02.000
But also they have good posture.

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
They're not like staring down at screens.

37:04.000 --> 37:05.000
Right.

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
They were for a while.

37:07.000 --> 37:08.000
Right.

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
They're not like in drama club.

37:10.000 --> 37:14.000
You know they have reasons to.

37:14.000 --> 37:17.000
I'm not going to jump the shark of starting to like giraffes.

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
But.

37:19.000 --> 37:22.000
So you've softened your stance on giraffes maybe a little bit.

37:22.000 --> 37:26.000
Well I just saying you respect your enemy.

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
Like whoa.

37:28.000 --> 37:33.000
And I just the important thing is that you know the reason I come down on giraffes is

37:33.000 --> 37:39.000
because people I think there's an unspoken assumption that human beings because they

37:39.000 --> 37:43.000
don't have long necks and they don't eat really high leaves and they don't live in the

37:43.000 --> 37:48.000
desert they don't walk around and they don't have animal print like style like that because

37:48.000 --> 37:53.000
that because of that like we're some kind of horrible species that like deserves to die

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
and well we're killing the planet.

37:55.000 --> 37:58.000
Come on we're we're pretty amazing.

37:58.000 --> 38:02.000
We're like little little monkey robots like we're great.

38:02.000 --> 38:05.000
We we we took a different route.

38:05.000 --> 38:12.000
We're like hey listen like what am I going to be the perfect squirrel.

38:12.000 --> 38:19.000
No I was he become an ape and then and then like you know we represent the branch of DNA

38:19.000 --> 38:24.000
that's like just kept just kept kept doubling down on fucking insanity.

38:24.000 --> 38:27.000
You know just going like why don't you just fucking be Howard Hughes about it.

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
Just show me the blueprints baby.

38:29.000 --> 38:33.000
And and and that's that's a proud proud legacy.

38:33.000 --> 38:38.000
Which is stands on like like a bird like a bird bird.

38:38.000 --> 38:43.000
Yeah I don't I don't I don't admire them.

38:43.000 --> 38:47.000
Oh you don't know they have the gift of flight then.

38:47.000 --> 38:53.000
A gift or the free cookie of flight that was laying on the table that no one wanted to eat.

38:53.000 --> 38:59.000
Evolution they they they they they built feathers over over time they turned from lizards into

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
into feathered creatures that could fly.

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
Yeah but look how many birds there are.

39:03.000 --> 39:09.000
Yeah like like it's so derivative like how many species like there's like five billion species of bird.

39:09.000 --> 39:17.000
Right they're all like like like like like like like you know we've tuned it out because we evolved after them

39:17.000 --> 39:22.000
so our eardrums don't bleed from listening to it but they're fucking garbage animals

39:22.000 --> 39:27.000
like they're they're just constantly going like look out look out my name's Steve.

39:27.000 --> 39:32.000
Wow wow hey over here check it out whoa whoa like like like they're they're insane.

39:32.000 --> 39:39.000
We've become them now but but but like it's like I mean birds are just garbage.

39:39.000 --> 39:45.000
What about like a like a noble like owl like just lives alone hunts at night and just does his thing and his head can swivel.

39:45.000 --> 39:46.000
Crazy man.

39:46.000 --> 39:53.000
I mean predatory birds are pretty kind of interesting because they're birds but they eat fucking mammals.

39:53.000 --> 39:54.000
That's fucking cool.

39:54.000 --> 40:06.000
That's berserk any any any animal any species that crosses back over like like fish that eat fucking people or birds or

40:06.000 --> 40:13.000
spiders that eat like fish like like like like you gotta automatically go.

40:13.000 --> 40:21.000
They're awesome just because they're just they're like Neo in the matrix like they're they're not even like that's pretty crazy.

40:21.000 --> 40:29.000
If you're a fish and you eat a monkey like even though the monkey is my relative I got it.

40:29.000 --> 40:32.000
I'm not I'm not like oh that monkey deserved it.

40:32.000 --> 40:33.000
I'm not a victim blamer.

40:33.000 --> 40:34.000
I'm just saying like that's a cool fish.

40:34.000 --> 40:39.000
How do you feel about whales.

40:39.000 --> 40:43.000
I don't I don't I get it.

40:43.000 --> 40:52.000
You know I look you know they had legs and they bailed the whales had legs.

40:52.000 --> 40:53.000
Yeah.

40:53.000 --> 40:59.000
Whales were like I don't know hippos or something and then they went back into the ocean like they're like just can't do it.

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
Do they have vestigial hind legs.

41:01.000 --> 41:02.000
I think they have yet.

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
You can see from the hip bones.

41:04.000 --> 41:05.000
All right.

41:05.000 --> 41:06.000
I mean they're mammals that live in the ocean.

41:06.000 --> 41:07.000
Yeah.

41:07.000 --> 41:12.000
Let's not Jeff please Jeff mammals.

41:12.000 --> 41:17.000
Dolphins sea lions walruses.

41:17.000 --> 41:25.000
You know these are these are these are these are mammals that spent some time enough time on land that they had they have shoulders and hips.

41:25.000 --> 41:28.000
And then they then they went back into the ocean.

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
Why do you think they went back.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
I mean there was too many birds.

41:32.000 --> 41:38.000
I don't want to punch down but it's like I mean you said they gave up.

41:38.000 --> 41:42.000
No they they went for they went for the brass ring.

41:42.000 --> 41:43.000
Of course they gave up.

41:43.000 --> 41:46.000
They went back to the where amoebas are.

41:46.000 --> 41:47.000
They.

41:47.000 --> 41:48.000
Yeah they gave up.

41:48.000 --> 41:49.000
They went up there.

41:49.000 --> 41:50.000
It's fucking crazy out here.

41:50.000 --> 41:53.000
There's a son that fucking beats your ass all day long and it's fucking.

41:53.000 --> 41:54.000
They might have just chose.

41:54.000 --> 41:55.000
Water.

41:55.000 --> 41:56.000
There's tigers.

41:56.000 --> 41:57.000
There's giraffes peeing on each other.

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
I'd rather go back and swim.

41:59.000 --> 42:00.000
Yeah.

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
I just you know how people go like oh dolphins.

42:02.000 --> 42:07.000
So how do we know they're not like the best species ever because just because we can't

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
understand them because they squeak when they talk.

42:09.000 --> 42:14.000
Well I'll tell you how we know because they were they were like dogs that bailed.

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
That's how we know they were on land.

42:16.000 --> 42:17.000
They had a shot.

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
They had a shot.

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
Dolphins are smarter than dogs.

42:21.000 --> 42:22.000
Yeah.

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
I'm sure dolphins are smarter than a lot of things.

42:24.000 --> 42:28.000
But you know what they're not smarter than us because they fucking like we stuck it out

42:28.000 --> 42:29.000
man.

42:29.000 --> 42:30.000
We're like all right.

42:30.000 --> 42:31.000
Here we go.

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
I think a great time to climb a tree motherfucker.

42:33.000 --> 42:36.000
What about what about like a fucking badass crocodile.

42:36.000 --> 42:39.000
Like doesn't they have no enemies.

42:39.000 --> 42:43.000
There's no there's no one above them in the food chain crocodiles and alligators.

42:43.000 --> 42:46.000
You got to you got to give them props right because they're like basically dinosaurs.

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
They they're like they stuck it out.

42:48.000 --> 42:53.000
They're like they're like your friend that listens to vinyl but like they but actually

42:53.000 --> 42:56.000
has like a system that we're like actually I got to hand it to you.

42:56.000 --> 43:02.000
You're not just jerking yourself off here like you this works like I can't get purple

43:02.000 --> 43:06.000
purple people either on iTunes.

43:06.000 --> 43:07.000
Yeah man.

43:07.000 --> 43:08.000
You got it.

43:08.000 --> 43:12.000
You know like like like when you have a friend that's like a vinyl hipster that's like you

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
actually can see the practicality in it.

43:14.000 --> 43:19.000
But if you put a giraffe versus a crocodile.

43:19.000 --> 43:20.000
Yeah.

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
Giraffes gonna win.

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
Cannot run him or but I'm not a violent.

43:24.000 --> 43:27.000
I don't believe that what what's then sharks.

43:27.000 --> 43:28.000
We should all love sharks.

43:28.000 --> 43:29.000
Right.

43:29.000 --> 43:30.000
Sharks are fucking dicks.

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
Sharks are the worst.

43:32.000 --> 43:33.000
You don't like sharks.

43:33.000 --> 43:34.000
No sharks are assholes.

43:34.000 --> 43:41.000
Sharks are sharks are amoeba that just fucking like fucking voted for Trump at every like

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
evolutionary election.

43:43.000 --> 43:47.000
They just they just turned into they just everybody was like like like the other amoeba were like

43:47.000 --> 43:53.000
we're gonna become worms and tubes and the sharks are the ones that were like yeah but

43:53.000 --> 43:57.000
wouldn't we need teeth to like eat and everyone's like okay cool you can do that but there's

43:57.000 --> 44:02.000
no plants to eat and they're just like nah and then just like they just turned into giant

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
mouths that just float through the ocean.

44:04.000 --> 44:10.000
What's the difference between you glorifying humans for sticking it out on land versus sharks

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
sticking it out in the water and perfecting being in the water.

44:12.000 --> 44:15.000
Well I'm gonna say across the board if you're in the ocean you're a pussy.

44:15.000 --> 44:18.000
Like I'm just saying like you're either.

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
That is a fucking hard stance.

44:20.000 --> 44:24.000
I know well also I didn't want to this thing is like language fails me because it's like

44:24.000 --> 44:28.000
anything like I'm trying I've been trying to like remove that from my vocabulary because

44:28.000 --> 44:33.000
it's like it's you know like I used to I used to say fag and retard and stuff too and

44:33.000 --> 44:38.000
like I had to like teach myself to like knock it off and like pussies like but it's hard

44:38.000 --> 44:41.000
like I need like a you know I want to talk about it.

44:41.000 --> 44:45.000
If you can go back in time and still use the words fag pussy and retard what are your

44:45.000 --> 44:55.000
thoughts?

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
Let's put the n-word back on the table too.

44:57.000 --> 45:00.000
Guys we are living it in a time when I can use all those words.

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
It's a choice.

45:02.000 --> 45:07.000
That's the secret service didn't come to my house.

45:07.000 --> 45:11.000
My doctor didn't tell me to cut down on the n-word.

45:11.000 --> 45:17.000
I'm going to say the word giraffe and then I'm going to say fag pussy and retard and

45:17.000 --> 45:21.000
then what you did not my doctor did tell me.

45:21.000 --> 45:27.000
It's a new it's a new board game which I used to be in the nation biology classes everywhere

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
playing fag pussy and retard.

45:29.000 --> 45:34.000
If you pay five dollars a month for subscription to Harmontown you can find out whether Dan

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
thinks giraffes are fags.

45:36.000 --> 45:41.000
Wait but then we should make it a full fuck Mary kill and have three animals into and play

45:41.000 --> 45:42.000
fag pussy retard.

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
I'm not I'm not I'm not subscribing.

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
I didn't say any of those words.

45:46.000 --> 45:51.000
But all I'm saying is like if you're in the ocean.

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
You called all sea animals pussies.

45:53.000 --> 45:57.000
I know I'm I've been biting my lip trying to think of like a way to say like I'm saying

45:57.000 --> 46:06.000
like like you you're you're in the in the year if you're in the ocean the earth is 85%

46:06.000 --> 46:07.000
water.

46:07.000 --> 46:08.000
Okay.

46:08.000 --> 46:14.000
So as we all know every human being is 85% moron like like like everything everything

46:14.000 --> 46:20.000
is 85% garbage hack dumb 85% of all dentists suck at dentistry.

46:20.000 --> 46:23.000
You know 85% of all comics are unfunny.

46:23.000 --> 46:32.000
You know 85% of this podcast is this retarded like 85% of the planet is water 85% of our

46:32.000 --> 46:33.000
body is watered.

46:33.000 --> 46:34.000
It's like it's like yeah it's the default.

46:34.000 --> 46:35.000
It's where we started.

46:35.000 --> 46:36.000
Okay.

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
I'm a little I'm a little teapot here.

46:38.000 --> 46:39.000
I'm called I'm an amoeba.

46:39.000 --> 46:40.000
I'm like okay.

46:40.000 --> 46:41.000
I got a organelle.

46:41.000 --> 46:42.000
I got some ribosomes.

46:42.000 --> 46:48.000
I'm going and then it's like yeah you have you have I forgive you because I am you.

46:48.000 --> 46:52.000
I'm your great grandson amoeba like but but.

46:52.000 --> 46:58.000
But the the amoeba that exists today right now the modern amoeba.

46:58.000 --> 47:02.000
He was just born a couple days ago.

47:02.000 --> 47:05.000
He's an idiot like he's a jerk.

47:05.000 --> 47:12.000
His parents like we we are a part of the family that branched off like our DNA was assembled

47:12.000 --> 47:20.480
by like you know risk takers like we're we're we're a we're a branch of the of the phenomenon

47:20.480 --> 47:23.680
called living genetics.

47:23.680 --> 47:31.680
We are the tentacle coming off of that one thing that is the tentacle that actually grabs

47:31.680 --> 47:33.240
the brass ring.

47:33.240 --> 47:37.800
All the other tentacles are like you know just for safety's sake why not stay in albino

47:37.800 --> 47:38.800
cave fish.

47:38.800 --> 47:45.640
Well I'll tell you why you can't you can't see anything it's ridiculous what about birds

47:45.640 --> 47:53.280
birds came everything came from the sea and we haven't got to the air and they were descended

47:53.280 --> 48:00.960
from like land reptiles they go fuck it I'm going to master the sky they were flying for

48:00.960 --> 48:06.840
millions of years you know insects did that it's dumb spores do that oh I'm going to

48:06.840 --> 48:12.600
force a great I'm going to fly through the air and land on shit I just think it's cooler

48:12.600 --> 48:18.280
to be a lizard and then go up on two legs and like I mean it's just kind of neat kind

48:18.280 --> 48:25.120
of cool kind of cool what we did we come out of the water we had we had to have like a

48:25.120 --> 48:30.880
scuba tank lung full of water for a while so I learned to like got better lungs and

48:30.880 --> 48:38.800
could breathe air like got was crawling got fur now this is where some of our cousins

48:38.800 --> 48:43.080
got weird fur that turned into feathers and started flapping around I don't know what to

48:43.080 --> 48:46.840
think about them you're talking about them like they're gods or angels I just don't I

48:46.840 --> 48:51.200
just think that they're like your weird cousin you know the liberal arts major or something

48:51.200 --> 48:55.960
I just I don't know whether to admire them or not I just don't I know well I'm saying

48:55.960 --> 49:01.440
like I don't I don't I'm not like looking up at birds and going like fuck they really

49:01.440 --> 49:07.040
nailed it because I just they have hollow bones you know that's why is that bad they

49:07.040 --> 49:11.320
have brains the size of a of the head of a pin like they don't even I don't think they

49:11.320 --> 49:16.840
know what they're doing honestly half the time I think you nailed it with what I immediately

49:16.840 --> 49:23.200
imagined as like an inspirational motivational poster and an office setting with the dolphins

49:23.200 --> 49:28.600
are dogs to gave up and just like a beautiful picture of dolphins yeah don't be a dolphin

49:28.600 --> 49:35.400
beat the dog stick it out yeah so but here's the thing is big fans of my podcast already

49:35.400 --> 49:40.560
know you've listened to 400 episodes of the show you know I subscribe to the Elaine Morgan

49:40.560 --> 49:46.240
theory of of human evolution which is explains the fact that we're different from chimps

49:46.240 --> 49:52.920
gorillas and orangutans in all the ways that dolphins sea lions walruses are different

49:52.920 --> 49:58.720
from other mammals we have everything in common with dolphins and whatnot that we don't have

49:58.720 --> 50:07.320
in common with our great great ape cousins and Elaine Morgan suggests that that's because

50:07.320 --> 50:14.200
four million years ago we too flirted with the dolphin root just long enough to lose

50:14.200 --> 50:22.560
our hair get blubbery fat and regulatable breathing upright vertical posture and then

50:22.560 --> 50:28.160
for some reason fucking we toughed it up what have got back on that land and that's why

50:28.160 --> 50:33.360
our story structure follows that one of dolphins dolphins kicked us out of the sea oh my god

50:33.360 --> 50:39.000
like we were exiled to land or we or we got jealous of them like we saw we just they were

50:39.000 --> 50:45.560
like hey you want to play and we're like oh yeah I think I forgot my phone and we were

50:45.560 --> 50:51.400
just like petty abaticus or like that's the thing about the aquatic ape theory is that

50:51.400 --> 50:59.520
that your early hominoids fled to the water's edge because it was full of giant animal I'm

50:59.520 --> 51:07.480
not gonna lie if I'm playing the first person shooter of ancient earth yeah that's thoughts

51:07.480 --> 51:12.480
gonna cross my head like let's why don't we stand in the ocean see if this tiger wants

51:12.480 --> 51:17.960
to if a big ass saber to the tigers coming at you I go I can I can go paddle out and

51:17.960 --> 51:22.240
think oh like oh there's food down here I can I can hold my breath for five seconds and

51:22.240 --> 51:27.360
go get an abalone and oh this is giving me all these B vitamins and my brain expands

51:27.360 --> 51:32.600
yeah and I come back out of the ocean and go oh I like I'm smarter now I can probably

51:32.600 --> 51:37.640
make a weapon and kill these tigers but there was also the thing I why not just live in

51:37.640 --> 51:42.880
the water and I can know because there's things worse than tigers in the ocean there's sharks

51:42.880 --> 51:46.680
it could have I mean it could have just been ambition it could have been like okay let's

51:46.680 --> 51:53.600
stay in the water but like you know see you later and the people that did stay in the

51:53.600 --> 51:59.240
water were out hunted and there are there are people in Africa that live like very much

51:59.240 --> 52:05.800
like you know the women give birth in the in the in the surf they squat and the baby

52:05.800 --> 52:13.040
comes out like a little wine cork and a little poop and they kind of they kind of bobbed to

52:13.040 --> 52:19.280
the surface the iron isles I don't know if it's the iron isles or not like I haven't

52:19.280 --> 52:28.080
I haven't I haven't spent a long time since I looked at the maps but the but it could

52:28.080 --> 52:31.720
also be what I mean and this is cartoonish of me to suggest because I don't really don't

52:31.720 --> 52:35.520
know anything I'm obviously I'm talking about but could it could it also have been an ice

52:35.520 --> 52:42.320
age like is that cartoonish thinking well maybe we had a semi-aquatic phase during the time

52:42.320 --> 52:47.440
when the the primates in general are the are the reason that they're all going extinct

52:47.440 --> 52:59.360
is because there we are the result of a particularly like lush equatorial like super rich kind

52:59.360 --> 53:08.280
of like a tropical biome you know that like could afford to sustain a great ape which is

53:08.280 --> 53:12.560
an ape that can't even fucking climb trees anymore basically like like doesn't have a

53:12.560 --> 53:20.760
tail anymore and and is a big giant just almost waste of time except for yours truly hello

53:20.760 --> 53:25.440
old so-and-so so that's why I don't like giraffes you know because I just feel like

53:25.440 --> 53:31.200
they're glorified like there's nothing in the who's out there the thing horrifying giraffes

53:31.200 --> 53:42.960
who's who's a big deal about giraffes Africa leans on them pretty hard if you like commercial

53:42.960 --> 53:50.760
for Africa I think of elephants personally but I was in a in a hot tub at the Disney

53:50.760 --> 53:58.160
World's Africa what church what's that resort called with the the African resort in Florida

53:58.160 --> 54:05.480
animal kingdom so we just like drank every a beer in every country in Epcot it's called

54:05.480 --> 54:11.520
drinking the world I made it through then we went back to the crib no we saw like Cirque

54:11.520 --> 54:17.680
de Soleil everyone fell asleep I made it through somehow I went back and took a like a like

54:17.680 --> 54:22.120
a Vicodin or a Percocet or something like that and sat in a jacuzzi and I was so drunk

54:22.120 --> 54:26.800
and I took this painkiller and I felt like I was floating above the jacuzzi and a fucking

54:26.800 --> 54:32.320
giraffe walked by like right next to the fence where I was and there was a big ass giraffe

54:32.320 --> 54:38.200
walked by and just gave me a look in the look even if I weren't drunk and on a painkiller

54:38.200 --> 54:45.560
the look was like you fucking drunk bro fucking gave me a very like a very professional like

54:45.560 --> 54:52.160
fatherly kind of like wow then he peed in my mouth and I started fucking him do you

54:52.160 --> 54:58.440
mean fucking him and I mean I was fucking here's the thing about fucking a giraffe

54:58.440 --> 55:02.200
you really gotta get up there you need a lot of I think that giraffe because he's a his

55:02.200 --> 55:07.000
DNA is old and African I think he was looking he was going by and looking at a monkey in

55:07.000 --> 55:13.360
some water and going like when are you guys gonna pick a lane pick away I thought I thought

55:13.360 --> 55:18.960
the giraffe was seeing you be in a in a body of water like swimming or something but you

55:18.960 --> 55:22.800
know like I can't as you know that they they choose not to swim right no they choose not

55:22.800 --> 55:28.000
to speak they can't swim well they've no one's ever seen what no one's ever seen hard to

55:28.000 --> 55:33.120
believe we've electrocuted an elephant for fun I will I will donate right drop my thing

55:33.120 --> 55:43.880
I'm looking where's my camera $50,000 for footage of a giraffe swimming oh no huh I don't care

55:43.880 --> 55:48.680
if you can be breaststroke and I want to see a fucking giraffe breaststroke breaststroke

55:48.680 --> 55:55.080
I just just making it from one from point A to point B and just completely swimming along

55:55.080 --> 55:59.680
well you know there's that what is that like British show like called the sex box where

55:59.680 --> 56:04.760
there's a big box and the people go and have sex in the box on stage completely in private

56:04.760 --> 56:08.560
maybe if we set something like that up then a giraffe would maybe feel more comfortable

56:08.560 --> 56:12.880
swimming because no one would actually be seeing it swim I think you're asked probably

56:12.880 --> 56:16.800
do swim they're just embarrassed about it clearly also I think probably when no one's

56:16.800 --> 56:26.320
listening they're fucking chatting up a storm I will be great what do you think a giraffe

56:26.320 --> 56:37.440
sounds like like a like a like a high pitched cow well just do can't you just that's I would

56:37.440 --> 56:51.840
pick that as a giraffe sound yes that's a good one what do you do you give us a giraffe

56:51.840 --> 56:59.760
did that get picked up at all it might be one of those I put my hand over the mic it

56:59.760 --> 57:05.520
might be guttural and a camel like it's camels yeah I think it camels okay so we're talking

57:05.520 --> 57:10.760
about a tenor camel like a camera is like a camel is like a there's footage of giraffe

57:10.760 --> 57:15.760
baritone right giraffe spit at people that's camels well camels do that but that's what

57:15.760 --> 57:20.440
I'm saying like maybe they're oh just their last name or their Roman name is that they

57:20.440 --> 57:27.440
looked like it has something to do with camels because they the Romans or whoever was spotted

57:27.440 --> 57:33.880
them was said this is a like a weird camel that makes sense yeah weird camel weird everything's

57:33.880 --> 57:40.520
a weird camel yeah you can't you can't just add weird to that's like a are giraffes drama

57:40.520 --> 57:44.720
dairies or no I was gonna say I think they are but are they part of the drama dairy family

57:44.720 --> 57:49.200
or no drama dairy that's a I don't know I don't know the word that word didn't you just

57:49.200 --> 57:53.520
Google is a couple nights ago Tom Rob I call you Tom I don't want your Tom all of a sudden

57:53.520 --> 58:00.520
the Roman taxonomical chart is just all it's just a chicken at the top and then everything

58:00.520 --> 58:07.400
that tastes like chicken which is everything just down in different weird camel tastes

58:07.400 --> 58:12.160
like chicken I just thought that was like that whatever I didn't can I I didn't kind

58:12.160 --> 58:20.800
of that's very well you know the Romans would bring on the triumphs when they would conquer

58:20.800 --> 58:26.360
like cities in Africa or and you know like the the Middle East and stuff and they'd bring

58:26.360 --> 58:31.720
back these animals and they'd walk them they bring an elephant back to Rome everybody lose

58:31.720 --> 58:35.440
their fucking mind and it's like what the world's full of aliens and then they just

58:35.440 --> 58:42.840
attack it with swords yeah I'm no I don't think it's funny animal cruelty I just think

58:42.840 --> 58:48.120
it's funny how dumb we are is like that that that you I don't know it's just like little

58:48.120 --> 58:53.080
kids understand that giraffes aren't shouldn't be fought with swords but Romans didn't like

58:53.080 --> 58:57.800
know that yet you know like they just they just took giraffes and put them in the Coliseum

58:57.800 --> 59:01.800
and then had like a slave attack it with a stick you know her badass and nobody fucks

59:01.800 --> 59:06.080
with as an adult zebra zebras will fucking get you they'll fuck it they're just made

59:06.080 --> 59:12.640
of muscle their horses like with muscles horses are scary like I don't know I think we take

59:12.640 --> 59:17.960
horses for granted because they're common animals you know but when you see a horse it's

59:17.960 --> 59:23.240
like that's a fucking monster like if this thing had scales I would be running but you

59:23.240 --> 59:27.560
notice that we've never domesticated zebras because you can't because they won't be fucking

59:27.560 --> 59:31.440
domesticated you cannot you've never seen anybody riding a zebra because zebra will

59:31.440 --> 59:41.600
eat you they have a lot of them in Tijuana what it's they have a you know Tijuana Tijuana

59:41.600 --> 59:46.960
they yeah they have like that's donkeys I know they spray paint them I'm just I was

59:46.960 --> 59:51.680
doing a bit what the donkey show spray paint the donkeys to be like out on the street corner

59:51.680 --> 59:58.400
what do they call them donkeys for some reason and I don't know why for some other reason

59:58.400 --> 01:00:05.920
they love Tweety Bird but but like I they just every street corner it's just it's like

01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:12.800
a thing that they you spray you paint the donkey with stripes and then you like you charge

01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:18.120
people to take a picture standing with the donkey that's fucked up but a zebra will kick

01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:23.560
your ass a zebra will beat up a horse I want to see zebra versus giraffe I wonder how much

01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:29.200
flexibility is in that marketplace like if I'm a Tijuana businessman and I have a donkey

01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:37.840
like like are they being like just unimaginative or is this like a steel trap of a market where

01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:44.040
like if you like one guy tries to put antlers and then it's just like fucking boo no like

01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:49.400
his family starves it's just like fuck you you idiot like like they have reality shows

01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:54.040
down there like called the Zonkey rescue where a guy comes in and goes like so what are you

01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:58.320
doing here well I just thought I'd put antlers on my donkey is like let me let me ask you

01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:02.680
something you see where are you standing right now Tijuana look look around what do you see

01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:08.040
human shit and prostitutes what else Zonkeys well so what what so you thought that you

01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:15.840
just try to just like be Dr. Moro about that market yeah well like the animal act I thought

01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:19.540
I'd try something different well you just tried losing all your money all right next

01:01:19.540 --> 01:01:23.200
chaching like whatever their sting is and then it goes to commercial what if somebody

01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:28.280
brought an actual zebra down to Tijuana like would that fuck up the marketplace or the

01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:36.480
holy shit that's like a Nathan for you yeah let's pitch it just bring a real zebra down

01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:43.120
to Tijuana I think I think that zebra gets killed immediately like no this is like like

01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:49.920
I I didn't spend all this money on donkey spray paint for you to bring in a free spray painted

01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:54.880
Zonkey by the way the zebra can protect itself Tijuana maybe the cleanest city if you're in

01:01:54.880 --> 01:02:01.000
Tijuana you listen to the podcast I'm very sorry I I'm talking about the what 20 years

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:09.720
ago when you took a train down to Tijuana and whatever neighborhood we love your Bibles

01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:27.520
who invited sir hi Zonkey get off your hi Zonkey I don't know if that's like if there's

01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:32.680
like a if Tijuana is like a giant city and there's like a huge like awesome clean part

01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:38.280
of it or just a struggling but integral part that then people are like so bummed out because

01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:42.240
Americans always refer to Tijuana as like a shit hole so these are like the Times Square

01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:51.600
Alamos of of Mexico right they're the cosplayers great you know what else is in Tijuana we

01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:59.840

01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:33.520
of 2017 you mean like what what what creature in the animal kingdom's knees are more fashionable

01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:38.000
today right because they're I don't think I think the bees knees are kind of lame these

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:44.040
days yeah I mean we like our bees these days I think but but but but look let's pick another

01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:51.080
one I said the elephants knees cuz don't elephants have four knees aren't they the only mammal

01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:55.480
that has four forward bending knees man that dude I went to this party last night that shit

01:03:55.480 --> 01:04:07.680
was the elephants knees that works it might accidentally encourage poachers yeah yeah man

01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:13.480
that shit that shit was the flamingos knees I'm sorry you guys we don't this is a bad

01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:22.880
this was bad if it was well yeah it I have a good phrase for something that goes badly

01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:30.200
the flamingos knees what about Mrs. C's knees hardly hardly what anyone's paying attention

01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:37.280
to it just is if her knees are visible so is the tip of her her bat her giant salami

01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:49.640
like clitoris dangles that's a long slumming Mrs. C's knees I'll take it should we play

01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:55.160
some prolonged D&D what do you think is it still prolonged and we've been like I really

01:04:55.160 --> 01:05:00.760
lose track of time up here time has been moving very slowly I want to assure you subscribers

01:05:00.760 --> 01:05:06.960
that I'm never it's a moving target I you know if we do the show 52 weeks a year as

01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:11.680
we have been like sometimes it's just gonna be and look here's the thing who we're gonna

01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:16.960
take your business Harrison Keeler oh too late looks like the throne is empty sounds

01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:22.680
like someone's the king of boring broadcasts maybe I'll do a film the war parody for six

01:05:22.680 --> 01:05:31.400
hours until you find a rubop until the news drops that Spencer's been forcing potted

01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:37.560
plants to watch him jerk off for five years that's still legal right is that out of fact

01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:42.160
certainly legal right I just don't know how that affects our business model our podcast

01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:47.600
I would like to say is well I don't want to jinx it but we are we are we are we are proofed

01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:55.920
against future allegations because I have spent 40 years just terrified of women I may

01:05:55.920 --> 01:06:02.480
have treated them poorly I certainly like thought of them in my head wrongly but I I

01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:08.640
mean no way if I have thought about having a button installed on my desk that would lock

01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:15.440
my door to keep people out while I jerk off thinking about a mannequin I am I will not

01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:22.400
hurt anyone you will not find out I've hurt anyone I am just scared Jeff to cocky he would

01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:28.280
never I mean I just like to get along with people yeah Spencer this seems like tempting

01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:35.200
fate right let's let's really tap that business well I was gonna do comedy comes with three

01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:43.040
things I was gonna say something like Spencer never leaves evidence yeah no I'm also terrified

01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:52.120
of what Spencer no loose ends that's what we call it old 50 gallon drum crittenden when

01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:56.240
I think of things I did wrong I remember like in seventh grade there was like a hair on the

01:06:56.240 --> 01:07:02.680
back of this girls shirt and I wanted to take it off but you know like I didn't do it I I

01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:08.040
touched her back instead and then I was like oh man I've done awful things like that I look

01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:14.800
back on I just to clear the air what do we just say because I'm undoing the joke I'm

01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:20.440
sad like when I was like 19 years old I went on a date with a girl and I remember like

01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:26.240
I pulled her back into the car for like like like she clearly didn't want to like a mart

01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:33.200
like a 10 and like I mean I just I feel horrified even say the thing is like I don't like I'm

01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:37.600
like saying those words out loud it's like oh Jesus you pull like like what you did what

01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:42.240
but I never said the words out loud it's like but it's a thing that I did like I I didn't

01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:50.640
like it was just like I I it wasn't like hateful but it was like I grabbed I grabbed and I

01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:54.960
clinged and I was like I was like come on don't go you know like like she decided the date

01:07:54.960 --> 01:08:03.640
was over you know yeah so there's one like if we go back that far and you know if they

01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:09.120
they find out also you've been fucking everyone's mama for as long as this podcast has been

01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:18.200
going on I mean you've been pretty candid about that what else have I done I think you

01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:22.400
fuck someone's mama on the lawn that was MC John I think of it I think if you get into

01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:28.000
the ex girlfriends like I just think or at a definitely web bookmarks like I'm just in

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:35.000
big trouble are you are you complicit in victimization because otherwise I think you're in the clear

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:38.440
no but I think but when you hear about like inappropriate behavior that means like the

01:08:38.440 --> 01:08:43.800
surf is getting close to my cabana right because I don't know what inappropriate behavior

01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:49.040
is I did that you just see that in the headline I if that I I always I keep telling myself

01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:54.760
well that I hope that means touching and like forcing and like things that have like a clear

01:08:54.760 --> 01:09:00.720
line around them because if it starts to become like well that joke wasn't very funny but

01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:04.120
he kept then he doubled down on it and he kept telling that joke you know like like

01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:08.120
stuff that's like a legitimate grievance like I don't know there's probably people out

01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:12.600
there with stories you know that Al Franken thing it's kind of weird I was arguing with

01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:16.680
someone on Twitter about this and I think they turned out to be right but they were

01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:21.640
mad because people were kind of lumping the two allegations together the groping allegation

01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:29.840
and the kissing allegation and Al Franken is kind of denied the severity although he apologized

01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:35.240
about the groping thing because it was like this was a staged photo or whatever but then

01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:41.240
he kind of just said as for the kiss I don't remember that but that's arguably a more egregious

01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:46.400
offense because it includes potentially forcing his tongue down into her mouth which is like

01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:50.360
that's it's pretty gross and the person was saying that lumping them together means that

01:09:50.360 --> 01:09:53.440
wouldn't get taken separately and then people would focus on the groping which is easier

01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:57.760
to dismiss and so you're kind of you know you know dealing with that way but we really

01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:06.240
kind of don't talk about that part of it which is to me a lot more aggressive I know but

01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:11.200
every time we start talking about it we're it's if we if we're saying anything other

01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:19.920
than look I did something I I'm thinking differently whatever like it's like like we can only have

01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:28.160
these conversations about like what anything that mitigates the idea of of a of a of a

01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:33.720
claim is like kind of that's a hot stove for who knows how long I don't know how long that

01:10:33.720 --> 01:10:40.280
stove will stay just like bright red hot I'm not I'm not touching it I did it was good

01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:44.520
I just think that I've thought the same thoughts though it's a bummer because well one one thing

01:10:44.520 --> 01:10:48.560
is hearsay and one thing is like a but I and I talked about that last week where it was

01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:54.840
like that the the weird thing about it is that I felt I I could put my I found myself

01:10:54.840 --> 01:11:00.480
becoming like a weird liberal version of a Roy Moore supporter almost like it's it's

01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:06.240
like a microcosm thing because it was like as soon as I started freaking out about net

01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:10.920
neutrality and thinking that there was a political reason for any of this then I immediately

01:11:10.920 --> 01:11:15.760
started going like well what if this woman's just lying you know right and the and the

01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:23.880
and the phrase what if this woman's just lying has to be a I think of well well my rule to

01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:29.280
my game I'm playing is that's not a that's not a conch that's available that's behind

01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:34.000
glass for about five years but you don't have to be all clear like you know you're not advertising

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:37.480
that though you're just explaining your thought process if thoughts enter your head that's

01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:42.480
just kind of you can't stop that it's how you deal with those thoughts and yeah and I don't

01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:47.800
think you've been like that's why I would put a button on my desk I locked my door can't

01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:56.160
control thoughts I just think like that but just to be clear again it's to keep people

01:11:56.160 --> 01:12:02.800
out not to keep people in when I went to University Southern California like I had I stayed in

01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:13.720
the dorm where a lot of film student kids were and mostly guys that that I met anyway

01:12:13.720 --> 01:12:21.120
if those guys a lot of whom were rich kids that are going to go on to have like lots

01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:30.120
of access and lots of power in the film community if they ever were going to be the Harvey Weinstein

01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:40.320
he kind of gropey rapey asshole gross guy I think there's a huge part of like men going

01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:47.520
into positions of power with government or film and like I can control what women do

01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:51.680
like I can make that I have you tell them to do things yeah I can make them do things

01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:57.520
that they might not want to do because I'm in a position to affect their lives and careers

01:12:57.520 --> 01:13:03.400
I don't care how many people have to fucking go down with the ship of like all these allegations

01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:08.000
right now I would like to think that if you're in a film school right now and you're a young

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:13.640
man going through film school and thinking of being a producer or a director you watch

01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:20.120
your fucking step now because if you do anything that's cause for fucking retirement instantly

01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:24.720
if you haven't thought about it and that's maybe one of the reasons that you haven't

01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:33.240
thought about is the reason why you want to rap or make movies or ride a unicycle or

01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:39.280
I think that like for guys it can be a super unspoken super unchallenged thing like yeah

01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:44.320
yeah well society signals that that's what we should be doing too it's it's it's something

01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:49.320
that we've been allowed to not think about for like 60,000 years there's been no sort

01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:53.520
of damocles over your head like you were allowed to do it and the worst case scenario that

01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:57.720
you had a reputation but I mean the media has said the signal that you're a bad you're

01:13:57.720 --> 01:14:01.520
a downtrodden protagonist because you don't have a job and you don't have a girl and then

01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:05.520
you go through a journey and you get a job and that gets you a girl and that's succeeding

01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:09.640
at life that's what we tell people they should do you should get a job because a job will

01:14:09.640 --> 01:14:13.840
get you a girl and that's you know and there's no agency in that but I think that that's

01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:18.320
the signal we've been saying through storytelling for years and years and you know we're only

01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:22.200
just starting to realize those are the signals we've been sending and that's not necessarily

01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:27.120
what we should be doing although that's still mainly the story underlying a lot of stories

01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:31.720
is they they go and do some tasks that then gives them professional acumen and a woman

01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:36.360
yeah go ahead no we were talking about that the other day too like that's the 80s movie

01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:41.320
thing where you're supposed to root for the underdog who's still a white man but he is

01:14:41.320 --> 01:14:46.640
like the beta male and his enemy he's the default he's the base of like the lowest you

01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:53.080
can be as a nerd in a school and even if you're white and straight and affluent like you deserve

01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:58.800
whatever you're able to get so if you're able to beat the jock then the the getting the

01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:03.800
girl is your prize and you've earned it like you're saying the same yeah even in the most

01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:16.480
woke 80s culture it was it's like the alpha males Aryan girlfriend who's classically beautiful

01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:22.720
that the nerd protagonist wants the whole movie is then the third act as he realizes

01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:27.880
that he should have the woman that he had the whole time his best friend who's got maybe

01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:34.600
shorter darker hair and but it's all it's like the unspoken thing because you watch

01:15:34.600 --> 01:15:37.800
a movie like that you're 10 years old that's the 80s and you go this movie has a pretty

01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:45.120
good value system like it taught me not to go for this judge a book by its cover because

01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:50.440
why you know this Daphne oh you can fall for these things and like oh but it's boof that

01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:58.600
I want I she's my best buddy it that's a that's the that's Teen Wolf the original movie once

01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:05.920
you wrote that movie saying like like heroes journeywise like once you become fully self-actualized

01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:10.080
that's when you get to have a girl when in real life exactly it's a reward coming a real

01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:15.520
person that's exactly the point you know that having a girl in your life who makes you

01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:20.120
smarter it's a reward you forget about the way Miller we all we've always known that

01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:24.840
Budweiser was lying to us by telling us that if we drank Budweiser we get laid like we've

01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:29.120
we've all been smart enough to know that we've made fun of that if we are over over a certain

01:16:29.120 --> 01:16:34.760
tax bracket or IQ but the thing that I think the smartest of us like don't got away with

01:16:34.760 --> 01:16:42.000
not thinking about is that idea that that that part of of fulfillment in general spiritual

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:51.400
fulfillment even is acquisition of a female yeah is like a coupling up and it's yeah whatever

01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:56.800
okay we've we've we've we did a good job thing in every mythology it's coming back from like

01:16:56.800 --> 01:17:02.760
there's the oneness and then you know in the you know Adam and Eve story it's like man makes

01:17:02.760 --> 01:17:07.600
God makes man androgynous and then they split apart and then the whole journey is like they're

01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:12.160
they're half of each other and then they have to come back and realize like you know the

01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:16.880
and then like the father and the I'm I'm mixing things but like the father and the mother the

01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:23.680
same thing it's all the oneness that's like when you become fully self actualized and

01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:31.120
this like the fulfillment of the self is realizing the male and female in those heteronormative

01:17:31.120 --> 01:17:35.760
terms are two parts of the one yeah and there's a syndrome there because I don't know why I'm

01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:40.280
bothering to even look out at a landscape of shit as if I didn't write a pilot where

01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:46.320
Joel McHale plays a guy who the the thing that is driving was he's trying to fuck Britta

01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:52.440
so he's doing everything that all of my sexual role models did in the movies that I grew

01:17:52.440 --> 01:17:59.120
up on that that that socialized me which is he's lying to a woman to try to trick her

01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:08.240
into fucking him because if he does that he'll he'll be happier he's and it's romantic because

01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:15.520
he oh look how befuddled and what a what a crazy tangled web he's weaving oh you men

01:18:15.520 --> 01:18:21.160
you're so you're willing to do so much just to get that sweet pussy it's like it's like

01:18:21.160 --> 01:18:26.480
we look I looked at it as like like oh well this is what drives us all it's like wanting

01:18:26.480 --> 01:18:32.200
a hamburger so I'm worried about writing a sitcom what's motivating this protagonist

01:18:32.200 --> 01:18:37.400
so I did the same thing in the 21st century that I grow grown up on which is just like

01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:45.560
and and if you ultimately you ultimately make it clear that the that the superior male role

01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:51.520
model male role model is obit like over Jeff who doesn't have those same like as the two

01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:57.280
parts of that male part not that you know obit is specific maybe throughout the lifetime

01:18:57.280 --> 01:19:01.560
of the show but the first six episodes of that show are basically like the same old

01:19:01.560 --> 01:19:07.240
John Hughes slash Kevin Smith slash whatever it's just it's just you're you're a man you

01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:11.840
you want to get that woman that's but part of that that I think that that's like guys

01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:14.920
like me they're just like well I want to write a TV show I want to write a movie I wanted

01:19:14.920 --> 01:19:20.880
to I need to I need to motivate this character it's like oh well let's put a bone in front

01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:28.600
of the dog so it goes around the whole circle and and like it you when you know not realizing

01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:36.080
that you're you're fundamentally like you're not even like you're going to work out with

01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:39.960
a box around you that you didn't even know you had around you like and then you're and

01:19:39.960 --> 01:19:43.560
then you think you're making these decisions but you're like inside this box anyways I'm

01:19:43.560 --> 01:19:47.840
glad this topic is unavoidable I'm glad that we've we've talked about it consistently for

01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:53.360
the last fucking whatever I hope we talk about it for another year and if if you hate every

01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:57.960
time it comes up then you're a rapist and I hope we keep talking about it as a group

01:19:57.960 --> 01:20:03.080
of white men yeah I hope I hope I hope I hope I hope I hope I hope I hope every time we

01:20:03.080 --> 01:20:10.000
do it I'm serious I hope someone ends the conversation with with that punch line no

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:14.840
I'm serious oh I thought you were I I want I'm gonna have it if we start talking about

01:20:14.840 --> 01:20:21.240
this if there's a not white guy on stage I'm gonna shut it down all right because what

01:20:21.240 --> 01:20:34.320
more can we add to the perspective I've been sweet sweetie we're trying to do a show yeah

01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:42.200
I've been doodling over here I drew a kind of a bad giraffe I drew I think like like

01:20:42.200 --> 01:20:47.720
some sort of prince with a turban on his head all right how much D&D time do we have

01:20:47.720 --> 01:20:54.560
left we got most of it all right so it let's let's thank Rob Tanchum for his his lyrical

01:20:54.560 --> 01:21:05.240
madness Rob Tanchum giraffe facts given giraffe facts people don't know the giraffe swear

01:21:05.240 --> 01:21:13.920
giraffe slacks I think I'm conflicted about the do we have to have a no applause rule

01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:20.080
because when nine people applaud it just sounds like then then everyone hears the nine people

01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:24.560
I don't think it's gonna hit the microphones either way I think if you hear all right in

01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:28.480
the background I'm gonna listen to it again yeah I know you don't want to you don't want

01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:32.440
to like walk around with a baseball bat and go okay guys there was a lot of laughter and

01:21:32.440 --> 01:21:40.240
applause last time do we have Levy here yeah let's bring him is Levy here Steve Levy bring

01:21:40.240 --> 01:21:52.960
it more white dudes on the stage is white guy time again but at least I'm like somewhat

01:21:52.960 --> 01:22:00.160
of a man I'm on a minority right yeah you're the Jewish Paul Newman Paul Newman was Jewish

01:22:00.160 --> 01:22:05.080
I thought we established we are now we are now officially as the White House now that

01:22:05.080 --> 01:22:10.400
you are still the Jewish Paul Newman I'll take it just because he's also Jewish doesn't

01:22:10.400 --> 01:22:19.400
make him more Jewish than you okay I'm just trying to diminish your sexiness and in any

01:22:19.400 --> 01:22:24.000
way I can I don't know why that's the way to do it I mean Paul Newman's a great looking

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:30.120
guy I'm trying to kind of soft like like lob you a compliment and well wasn't Paul Newman

01:22:30.120 --> 01:22:36.040
when he was young wasn't he kind of like was he blonde he's always bro he was always kind

01:22:36.040 --> 01:22:44.040
of well we were all you mean like as a toddler until I was like seven maybe me too I was

01:22:44.040 --> 01:22:48.760
dropped I was strawberry blonde that's the thing I had reddish blonde hair they say that's

01:22:48.760 --> 01:22:53.200
one of the things and by they I mean I think the person who wrote the intro to Playboys

01:22:53.200 --> 01:23:02.720
blondes brunettes and redheads 1989 that they we associate blonde hair with with youth and

01:23:02.720 --> 01:23:10.600
by youth I guess they meant babies my beard grows in red sometimes and my mustache is

01:23:10.600 --> 01:23:15.960
blonde that's cool it's crazy right there's only one thing that makes me sad about watching

01:23:15.960 --> 01:23:21.720
my body you're like you're like Paul Newman spamoni I miss my beard you think one day your

01:23:21.720 --> 01:23:26.640
beard's already back no I missed the red I missed I find with a gray beard but it's

01:23:26.640 --> 01:23:34.400
like big deal gray beard Dumbledore like I my beard was it was it was fun when it was

01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:40.360
before it went gray I don't care if I go bald I mean I am going bald okay you know I care

01:23:40.360 --> 01:23:45.840
my eyes are melting okay you know I don't care your eyes are melting well you know I

01:23:45.840 --> 01:23:50.760

01:23:50.760 --> 01:23:58.240
I got another one so I can see my phone you know look kids here's what happens you get

01:23:58.240 --> 01:24:04.960
you get you get you get placed into a little baby body and then you you it just you know

01:24:04.960 --> 01:24:11.360
it's up it's it's the cells are dividing for 18 years and then they just stop and then

01:24:11.360 --> 01:24:19.200
you're just like a tree and the fall is 60 years long Jeff do you think don't have a

01:24:19.200 --> 01:24:23.320
degree in this but I'm pretty sure that's how it is you think one day I'll have a super

01:24:23.320 --> 01:24:30.440
successful food business I think you're gonna really succeed in salad dressings and spaghetti

01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:36.640
sauces cool that's exactly what I was looking for Paul Newman passed away didn't he no yeah

01:24:36.640 --> 01:24:42.880
he did unfortunately yeah well Paul Newman died pretty sure it was a while ago just now

01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:51.880
okay no like years ago well he's I mean seven years ago nope nine I thought I was 2000 only

01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:57.560
the Sundance kid remains so now you're not the Jewish Paul Newman you're just the live

01:24:57.560 --> 01:25:10.720
Paul Newman you're the alive doesn't make you any less Jewish moving Paul Newman moving

01:25:10.720 --> 01:25:19.840
yeah like motion and animate animate yeah you're not wrong all right so Spencer how's

01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:26.240
everyone feeling good just got a nice haircut going yeah you know yeah I got a little haircut

01:25:26.240 --> 01:25:32.560
Dan you lost your beard starting to come back Spencer you just become more and more an exciting

01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:39.320
cast member of the bus and truck company of hair every moment my hair has been kind of

01:25:39.320 --> 01:25:44.280
loose in the ponytail lately do you ever trim off the the end so it can grow longer do you

01:25:44.280 --> 01:25:48.760
or just let it do its own thing no I just it's it's all too much work are you at your

01:25:48.760 --> 01:25:54.080
ideal hair length or do you know I don't know I think my hair is at a leg where it starts

01:25:54.080 --> 01:25:58.520
to become split ends and kind of disintegrates on its own yeah it's not really hair will

01:25:58.520 --> 01:26:02.400
stop on its own well if you cut off the split ends it'll keep growing you can make a girl

01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:07.040
quite long all right I might sometimes I think about what Spencer would look like if he did

01:26:07.040 --> 01:26:13.680
like the boy band spiked hair you know I'd look like Joey Fatone because he's got so

01:26:13.680 --> 01:26:19.680
much how high would it go like like spike it up and I was like Paul from Tekken frosty

01:26:19.680 --> 01:26:24.880
tips hmm I put this challenge out there to Harmontown fan art people let's see what

01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:31.720
we could make Spencer look like with some long long Spencer hair length frosty tips like

01:26:31.720 --> 01:26:43.160
Gerald from a Arnold oh damn or yahoo serious if I can invoke the name of yahoo serious is

01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:49.640
he alive he must have died looking it up he and Paul Newman both dead in the only way

01:26:49.640 --> 01:26:56.320
that matters we have to ask he seems to be alive no he can't be yahoo you got one job

01:26:56.320 --> 01:27:08.120
as an entertainer kid keep making him not have to ask if you're dead I think I think

01:27:08.120 --> 01:27:16.400
I think that maybe I'm guessing yahoo serious was a victim of like some shit he wasn't

01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:24.160
ready for like I think I think I think some dudes from William Morris like went down to

01:27:24.160 --> 01:27:30.000
an open mic you call that a contract this is a contract and he was like well if you

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:35.760
really think so and they're like oh we think so and then like he was probably 11 years

01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:39.800
old Spudgeon McKenzie made more money in one year than I've ever made in my life it was

01:27:39.800 --> 01:27:43.680
there was a time when Australian things were really fucking hot oh wait Spudgeon McKenzie

01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:49.680
was Australian wasn't he what I'm thinking Jaco Spudgeon McKenzie was an English Bulldog

01:27:49.680 --> 01:27:55.840
I take that back remember Jaco the battery guy yeah we remember Jaco all right Spencer

01:27:55.840 --> 01:28:02.760
do you want to fucking take us back I forget what happened last time I know I know I mean

01:28:02.760 --> 01:28:11.360
I remember but I don't totally remember that's not what you just said he forgot yeah refresh

01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:21.480
refresh our mutual memory last time on Harmontown our heroes were on the quest for Patchen's

01:28:21.480 --> 01:28:28.280
gym going along with Patchen's to the nearby town of Doornester they encountered Geffen

01:28:28.280 --> 01:28:33.160
that guy that they'd met a couple times at this point Geffen was headed to Doornester

01:28:33.160 --> 01:28:40.560
as well because he suspected the church was on weed then you guys went to the town you

01:28:40.560 --> 01:28:47.120
saw some crazy things in the form of zombies and skeletons they seemed bummed out in a

01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:53.760
graveyard because music was playing from a harp diarrhea junior tried to inspect the

01:28:53.760 --> 01:29:00.000
harp music but it vanished in a flash of ruby light and then the zombies attacked like they

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:07.480
were mindless zombies they were dispatched in short order as morning broke it was time

01:29:07.480 --> 01:29:13.520
to enter Doornester and they met the guards at the front gate applying various methods

01:29:13.520 --> 01:29:20.360
they got in the front gate and then they decided that they'd split up but met up and decided

01:29:20.360 --> 01:29:27.640
that they wouldn't split up or maybe would that's where they are now follow them today

01:29:27.640 --> 01:29:41.720
what will they do how will they succeed Patchen's gym now perfectly timed to the camera see

01:29:41.720 --> 01:29:48.080
that I was like pinching my nipple because I definitely was that whole time I was reading

01:29:48.080 --> 01:29:51.920
and assuming I was on camera it would be was your left hand you were pinching your right

01:29:51.920 --> 01:29:56.880
nipple yeah like this is that a thing you do I guess it seems to be right now it seems

01:29:56.880 --> 01:30:03.720
normal did I ever tell you guys on this podcast that I my doctor was giving me a testicular

01:30:03.720 --> 01:30:10.680
exam and my hand drifted up to my nipple like like like just instinctively like because

01:30:10.680 --> 01:30:19.480
I was like because there was shit going on with my crotch and I think it was like he's

01:30:19.480 --> 01:30:23.720
like all right I'll just check it out like and he's and I think it was probably something

01:30:23.720 --> 01:30:32.920
like I went like it was just like amazing to me that I would like like that must be

01:30:32.920 --> 01:30:38.760
some sort of like like youthful comfort mechanism yeah that's what I think it is I think it's

01:30:38.760 --> 01:30:43.440
just some weird yeah or a middle-aged comfort mechanism I don't know when I when I went

01:30:43.440 --> 01:30:54.480
nipples became so important to my bedroom life right they did that that round was bended

01:30:54.480 --> 01:30:59.000
like I for sure it's like because like nothing goes on in Harmontown without a nipple being

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:03.800
involved I saw this like therapist or something she was like a weird lady because she like

01:31:03.800 --> 01:31:08.440
had this mailer that's like don't use any scented shampoo or wear any cologne before

01:31:08.440 --> 01:31:13.440
you come in the office and stuff like which is just a weird thing for like an anxiety

01:31:13.440 --> 01:31:18.960
doctor or something because it's like anxiety inducing but we were sitting in the office

01:31:18.960 --> 01:31:24.520
and I had my hands in my lap and then she was like do you always cover your genitals

01:31:24.520 --> 01:31:29.040
with your hands it's like I just where do I put my hands and then I tried a bunch of

01:31:29.040 --> 01:31:34.480
different things like to this side to this side to both sides like it's like people put

01:31:34.480 --> 01:31:41.200
their hands in their lap I was doing I was picking different places to put my hands

01:31:41.200 --> 01:31:46.720
so fast that my knees just started moving on their own I got a pet peeve about that shit

01:31:46.720 --> 01:31:53.040
the smells that stuff no the therapeutic technique of asking you stupid questions of just going

01:31:53.040 --> 01:31:57.240
like did you notice when I asked you that question your voice got a little quieter or you know

01:31:57.240 --> 01:32:01.280
look at your body language right now or like one time one time Cody and I were in couples

01:32:01.280 --> 01:32:08.640
therapy and Cody wanted to put a pillow the therapist stepped out of the room and Cody

01:32:08.640 --> 01:32:14.640
put a pillow between us and then the therapist said she came back in just like see right

01:32:14.640 --> 01:32:19.240
away I think it's really important that to notice that Cody's created a barrier between

01:32:19.240 --> 01:32:23.800
the two of you Cody told me later she was farting and she didn't want to she was she

01:32:23.800 --> 01:32:29.520
was worried about farting and like it getting it was like it's like the I just I just like

01:32:29.520 --> 01:32:32.880
and then when we told the therapist that a week later because I was like you have to

01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:39.120
tell her that right you were creating a barrier you were protecting me from your farts that's

01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:45.520
adorable and intimate and and then when we told her that she of course she had to double

01:32:45.520 --> 01:32:49.200
down and go like well do you think me she basically said do you think the reason you

01:32:49.200 --> 01:32:54.640
were farting so much is because you needed a it is like all right a lot of this stuff

01:32:54.640 --> 01:32:59.040
is like cold reading stuff it's like let's try to make sense of our occupation here's

01:32:59.040 --> 01:33:02.960
the thing I'm a fucking like you know the reason I'm going like this and going like

01:33:02.960 --> 01:33:08.960
this isn't always because I'm like being resistant to you or like yeah it's like I don't

01:33:08.960 --> 01:33:15.320
know this is who I am you know like I could be like fucking like really open to you and

01:33:15.320 --> 01:33:20.440
like really I don't know like yeah I talked to people all the time and like they die like

01:33:20.440 --> 01:33:24.200
young writers ago like because they take like these seminars and stuff and part of it is

01:33:24.200 --> 01:33:28.440
like the now the people tell them like well when you pitch like like you should sit straight

01:33:28.440 --> 01:33:32.800
up and here's what you wear and all this stuff I'm like no go in like a Schrab you think they're

01:33:32.800 --> 01:33:39.320
looking for Schrabs all right yeah I always analyze people's body posture and then go

01:33:39.320 --> 01:33:44.000
this is stupid like so is that your first notice Spencer that you were touching nipples

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:49.000
during your your no that was just my hands in my lap it was like and then I do that all

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:52.840
the time and then every time I do it I think about it I mean the nipples just now during

01:33:52.840 --> 01:33:56.680
your your opening read no I I've probably done that while I was driving it's not like

01:33:56.680 --> 01:34:00.800
a sexual thing but it's just like yeah I guess something that happened I'm not gonna deny

01:34:00.800 --> 01:34:05.760
that it feels good it does like that I mean it doesn't feel as good as I always expect

01:34:05.760 --> 01:34:10.520
it to which is maybe why I keep trying my nipples are too sensitive I'm not a nipple

01:34:10.520 --> 01:34:15.320
guy yeah that's what I'm saying oh no too sensitive well then well then you know work

01:34:15.320 --> 01:34:20.600
on welcome to the party man so you pinch your nipple no I don't pinch it's not like you

01:34:20.600 --> 01:34:24.520
rub you rub a little stocking foot on your nipple no I don't wear a stocking no you rub

01:34:24.520 --> 01:34:32.840
a mannequin like I was like how would that fit like I I don't look I like there's nipple

01:34:32.840 --> 01:34:37.280
play if you go to bed with me now I don't know when it started I don't know if it was

01:34:37.280 --> 01:34:43.480
a gradual thing I don't know but I know it's full on now now it's just it's man is it almost

01:34:43.480 --> 01:34:48.920
a mandatory it's not mandatory it's just like if you love me you're gonna learn can there

01:34:48.920 --> 01:34:53.400
be a sexual encounter with you or does no nipple play no is that is that a lost Dan

01:34:53.400 --> 01:35:01.720
does not go for that I just I yeah I'll do anything if I'm in love with you what I don't

01:35:01.720 --> 01:35:07.080
you can poop on me I don't if you need me to not touch my what are my you want to not

01:35:07.080 --> 01:35:13.200
touch a wrap all right anyways I'm just saying pretty funny a guy giving me a trying to see

01:35:13.200 --> 01:35:17.600
if I have cancer and I fucking at it because a hand went towards my groin I have my other

01:35:17.600 --> 01:35:22.360
hand like shot up to my nipple okay so we're all we're all through the front gate of Dornister

01:35:22.360 --> 01:35:27.400
right yeah you're kind of let's say you're you're kind of in the shadow of this gate

01:35:27.400 --> 01:35:33.080
the the guards seem pretty sleepy and they went back to sleep and they're currently asleep

01:35:33.080 --> 01:35:37.320
all right so Carlos I know the plan was that we were gonna come in separately yeah it was

01:35:37.320 --> 01:35:43.000
a whole thing it's it but you know here we are let's let's just move ahead but we can

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:47.080
now we can still do what we wanted to do which is the guards don't give a shit they're sleepy

01:35:47.080 --> 01:35:52.760
this is this is my thought I think I want to over explain it it's just that like we're

01:35:52.760 --> 01:36:01.800
in this town we don't really know what we're looking for and more importantly we're we

01:36:01.800 --> 01:36:06.440
know there's something afoot in this town we like we need information and we need to

01:36:06.440 --> 01:36:13.440
like I feel like it's a disadvantage for us to be perceived as a group let alone a group

01:36:13.440 --> 01:36:18.320
of church officials why don't we why don't we right now split up and take like different

01:36:18.320 --> 01:36:22.440
parts of the town different like like maybe I'll go into the tavern or you go into the

01:36:22.440 --> 01:36:29.560
thing like we'll all pick a like well Spencer what buildings do we see in front of us the

01:36:29.560 --> 01:36:35.400
two seconds like my pitch is well he looks yeah my pitch is it's gonna be harder for

01:36:35.400 --> 01:36:42.680
me to pretend I'm not a cleric you know I'm I it's you should go go go frequent the taverns

01:36:42.680 --> 01:36:49.120
or whatever I think I'll go to the local church and just to be clear unless you guys get disguises

01:36:49.120 --> 01:36:53.360
you might have plain clothes with you but you're generally adorned in kind of church

01:36:53.360 --> 01:37:00.240
church oriented garments so unless you do something about that you will register as some church

01:37:00.240 --> 01:37:14.640
people of some sort we should go shopping what a girl wants what a girl needs Spencer what

01:37:14.640 --> 01:37:19.120
time is it when it's like hell yeah it's early morning no it's not early morning it's like

01:37:19.120 --> 01:37:24.800
maybe 10 10 a.m. at this point so shops are open shops shops would be open let's let's go

01:37:24.800 --> 01:37:30.480
into the clothing store let's pretend we don't know each other well you guys yeah cuz I don't

01:37:30.480 --> 01:37:35.400
I'm gonna go I'm gonna go check out the church is there a church of the silver flame there

01:37:35.400 --> 01:37:43.960
sure is I'll go there you guys go shopping and then and then split up we don't need to

01:37:43.960 --> 01:37:50.880
split up we're not wearing church clothes you currently are then you're gonna go shopping

01:37:50.880 --> 01:37:54.960
together yeah then you're gonna split up like Cisco and Ebert at the end of at the movies

01:37:54.960 --> 01:38:01.000
like people are gonna know are there any vendors like selling garments like out in the town

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:08.600
like or do I have to go into like a dedicated clothing shop there yeah there's like an open

01:38:08.600 --> 01:38:14.400
ear market that has some smaller shops and mostly stores so yeah so I go wandering around

01:38:14.400 --> 01:38:20.160
looking for a clothing vendor to maybe find something to like disguise myself as maybe

01:38:20.160 --> 01:38:26.160
just a regular citizen all right you find what late what's labeled by a wooden sign

01:38:26.160 --> 01:38:31.400
as the open-air black market there's a row of shops and stalls there's kind of two rows

01:38:31.400 --> 01:38:37.640
that flank this it's wider than a street but it's it's kind of like a street all the stalls

01:38:37.640 --> 01:38:43.040
that are open are are kind of guarded by a couple shopkeepers that are keeping all their

01:38:43.040 --> 01:38:50.760
wares like hidden under cloths and sheets and stuff so it's all like secret kind of secret

01:38:50.760 --> 01:38:55.280
wares most of these places are closed and shuttered it's very striking you might you

01:38:55.280 --> 01:39:01.040
wonder if there's like a recession or something a couple gold pieces out in my hand and I just

01:39:01.040 --> 01:39:05.600
kind of I'm kind of tossing them up and down like playing it cool but like clearly somebody

01:39:05.600 --> 01:39:13.880
that's got some money to spend like whistling a little you know a little tune all right um you see you see a familiar

01:39:13.880 --> 01:39:20.280
colorful like nice looking stall not a stall it's like a cart it's a cart for the fabricators

01:39:20.280 --> 01:39:25.440
guild and there's a colorfully dressed fabricator who's like he looks I don't know let's say

without really yeah I do decrementing your money I truly don't know well it should be

01:41:21.680 --> 01:41:28.920
in there so let's let's do Dan um Dan yeah I guess I'm one I'm kind of looking I'm assuming

01:41:28.920 --> 01:41:36.240
that if this is a town worth its salt that the church of the silver flame will have a

01:41:36.240 --> 01:41:41.680
will have a keep or something that can be seen in the skyline yeah it's one of the it's the

01:41:41.680 --> 01:41:47.920
largest building in town but not by much it's still a pretty small a tiny church it's it's

01:41:47.920 --> 01:41:53.440
kind of there's only like a sanctuary and a couple a couple other like side rooms it's

01:41:53.440 --> 01:41:58.800
a pretty small footprint of a building it also doesn't have that you can see like a silver

01:41:58.800 --> 01:42:03.840
flame on display like a big brazier it just has a bell tower like a small tiny church

01:42:03.840 --> 01:42:12.520
well I I approach it all right the you see you see Geffen's horse you see Geffen's horse

01:42:12.520 --> 01:42:16.680
what do you call it tied up out outside of the church and inside you hear him yelling

01:42:16.680 --> 01:42:21.920
at people I eavesdrop for a moment if I can make out what he's yelling he sounds like

01:42:21.920 --> 01:42:28.600
a drill sergeant like he's he's barking out orders and you can just hear the sounds of

01:42:28.600 --> 01:42:37.000
footfalls and people moving so he's saying like good move move it yeah you lousy lots

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:43.160
you worthless louts do laps and run and keep it up and you you're going slow and don't

01:42:43.160 --> 01:42:51.840
go slow you're supposed to be going fast now I'm in charge like that well I I move into

01:42:51.840 --> 01:42:55.360
the building I mean I'm not trying to be stealthy all right yeah you open the doors and you

01:42:55.360 --> 01:43:00.640
see everyone's just running laps around the outside perimeter or the inside perimeter

01:43:00.640 --> 01:43:09.280
of the building and Geffen saying yeah work work it work it just get and see me yeah he's

01:43:09.280 --> 01:43:19.120
like hey what's up hey so I just wanted to let you know I'm gonna try to do kind of a

01:43:19.120 --> 01:43:27.560
low-key thing are you telling me or him I'm telling Geffen okay like if anybody asks you

01:43:27.560 --> 01:43:34.200
about me don't tell him anything that I've told you about our previous missions like

01:43:34.200 --> 01:43:41.560
what happened back at what's it called Rowan Rowan or the city or the church the place

01:43:41.560 --> 01:43:48.560
that we just were yeah what was the town with Peerburn Abbey the yeah that that town was

01:43:48.560 --> 01:43:53.040
that Rowan no that you started in Rowan and then you went to the home office which was

01:43:53.040 --> 01:43:58.080
Peerburn Abbey which is the place that we were at where the shit hit the fan yeah Rowan

01:43:58.080 --> 01:44:05.400
right don't don't don't tell anybody how you know me like and my compatriots because I'm

01:44:05.400 --> 01:44:09.840
just I'm not I'm not I'm not like totally undercover like I'm not a badass or anything

01:44:09.840 --> 01:44:18.240
but I I just I'm trying to dig up leads in this town and I I don't want people to associate

01:44:18.240 --> 01:44:26.640
me with my friends you got it stranger thanks Jeff and Geffen is he's a bishop in the church

01:44:26.640 --> 01:44:30.560
you you don't know what he is actually he's a he's in the church militant which means

01:44:30.560 --> 01:44:35.520
he's not necessarily a leadership like like a priest or anything he's more like you like

01:44:35.520 --> 01:44:39.280
a kind of hired gun mercenary that's a good question anyway I'll ask Geffen that like

01:44:39.280 --> 01:44:46.040
who's is that who's the how high up does this local chapter go is there a fryer in charge

01:44:46.040 --> 01:44:51.200
of everything or no there was a priest but he actually left to go attend to matters at

01:44:51.200 --> 01:44:57.840
the church of Rowan when they had a leadership crisis so in their absence peach has been

01:44:57.840 --> 01:45:02.560
leading leading the pack but as you can see she hasn't been running a very tight ship so

01:45:02.560 --> 01:45:06.640
I'm whipping them into shape what get them off their weed what's peach is she just a

01:45:06.640 --> 01:45:16.480
pilgrim or something beaches she's what is she let's see sorry everybody she's an initiate

01:45:16.480 --> 01:45:24.120
which is the the step you go before you become a what was a pastor which is below a priest

01:45:24.120 --> 01:45:30.320
it's like she's she's working up some in the seminary ranks or whatever you know is she

01:45:30.320 --> 01:45:36.720
does she have an office here yeah yeah she there's the what do you call there's the pastor's

01:45:36.720 --> 01:45:41.720
office and then just the office office and then the sanctuary and then the dining hall

01:45:41.720 --> 01:45:49.000
which is just a tiny little kitchen well maybe I'll go have a chat with her well she'll have

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:54.480
to finish running laps because she's also has to be whipped into fit shape who the points

01:45:54.480 --> 01:45:59.760

01:50:02.720 --> 01:50:07.520
small it seems like recently someone moved out at out of it and took most of the things

01:50:07.520 --> 01:50:15.440
off the shelves when they did looks like things are kind of disarray around here yeah nearby

01:50:15.440 --> 01:50:20.200
church blew up and we had to have our priest go over and kind of straighten out this shit

01:50:20.200 --> 01:50:27.880

officials you know I'm I'm from the militant and you know some of the things I do are a

01:50:42.040 --> 01:50:47.440
little less holy than than than some of the stuff you you guys are used to it's all in

01:50:47.440 --> 01:50:58.440
the name of the silver flame you know what I mean all right I just curious since you

01:50:58.440 --> 01:51:09.440
know if this town are there people in this town that are available for hire if you would

01:51:09.440 --> 01:51:19.520
need certain things procured like day players well you know collectors of other people's

01:51:19.520 --> 01:51:30.760
stuff well I mean a lot of people here are ruffians brigands sell swords and thieves do

01:51:30.760 --> 01:51:37.240
I do do I have the letter remember the letter that we that we had that you said it was like

01:51:37.240 --> 01:51:42.280
in this guild speak kind of thing yeah do I have one of those you you have that message

01:51:42.280 --> 01:51:51.720
sure it's like like is there a is there a guild chapter that uses this this this language

01:52:01.600 --> 01:52:07.920
sector that much mercenary guilds fabricators guild seekers guild there's a lot of guilds

01:52:07.920 --> 01:52:13.080
there's something like 13 or 14 I can't remember is there a is there a thieves or an assassins

01:52:13.080 --> 01:52:21.480
guild well there's what do you call it I mean we don't have to call it anything but I said

01:52:21.480 --> 01:52:25.280
this conversation doesn't have to leave this room but it's church business and it's important

01:52:25.280 --> 01:52:32.360
to the silver flame right I mean not not really there's no overt coalition of thieves and and

01:52:32.360 --> 01:52:36.760
ruffians as far as I'm aware there's no it would be a terrible thieves guild if it was

01:52:36.760 --> 01:52:43.840
overt I'm asking you and the record will never show that I asked you let alone that you answered

01:52:43.840 --> 01:52:51.800
as a Dornaster regular you know and somebody who it appears could use a good word from

01:52:51.800 --> 01:52:59.280
central office yeah I mean for innocent so well yeah I mean you don't smoke pot no one

01:52:59.280 --> 01:53:04.320
does yeah like you're misunderstood you're doing a great job running this place thank

01:53:04.320 --> 01:53:09.200
you thank you you just need somebody to tell somebody that and what I just need to get my

01:53:09.200 --> 01:53:18.680
job done is a contact in the thieves or assassins guild I'm thinking more assassins there's

01:53:18.680 --> 01:53:23.000
no there's no thieves or assassins guild as far as I know there's just you know just the

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:31.920
theater why would you say it that way what do you mean well you made this crazy face

01:53:31.920 --> 01:53:38.160
no I didn't that was some other person I mean are the it's your theater guild like pretty

01:53:38.160 --> 01:53:41.920
rough around the edges it's the Dornester theater company it's the main business in

01:53:41.920 --> 01:53:50.680
town oh really yeah there's like four industries there's farming there's baking there's milling

01:53:50.680 --> 01:53:56.080
flour and there's theater seems weird because it doesn't seem like a real cultural epicenter

01:53:56.080 --> 01:54:01.920
no but you know these these are free freewheeling folk not necessarily fitting in with society

01:54:01.920 --> 01:54:06.920
they wander into Dornester yeah they travel around they wear disguises and I mean costumes

01:54:06.920 --> 01:54:12.880
and dresses different shit and go different places yeah they love crazy clothes and tights

01:54:12.880 --> 01:54:17.240
and stuff and you know they put on shows it's a great time you know there's not a lot of

01:54:17.240 --> 01:54:22.000
fun out here and so so you go to the theater it's like yeah it's like what we've built

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:29.120
this is our city got a crazy wall you you've you've known this these theater people they've

01:54:29.120 --> 01:54:35.560
always been around and yeah but they also like drift around like they go to other places

01:54:35.560 --> 01:54:40.400
and not usually I mean you there's there's too many people in town to really know who's

01:54:40.400 --> 01:54:50.000
here and who's not it's a big town yeah yep I'm outside in my new clothes that's probably

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:57.880
a good call and I walk around and I mean I didn't hear this conversation but let's just

01:54:57.880 --> 01:55:04.600
say I dressed up in my new flashy theatrical clothing is it possible that I would run across

01:55:04.600 --> 01:55:09.200
the theater guilt well come on you can't Spencer tell yeah yeah that's that's not fair right

01:55:09.200 --> 01:55:12.880

01:55:22.880 --> 01:55:28.320
normally covered in in farm goods and it just says the farmers tough and it's it's just

01:55:28.320 --> 01:55:33.120
completely abandoned and there's like a weapons dealer who just has this rolling cart with

01:55:33.120 --> 01:55:39.360
weapons and stuff and what else do you got oh there's a bunch of people there's a bunch
