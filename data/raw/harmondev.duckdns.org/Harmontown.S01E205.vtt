00:00.000 --> 00:12.680
From the Malboa Theater in San Diego, coming down 2015,

00:12.680 --> 00:33.000
Harmontown is now in second, but brings better criticism out to the stage.

00:33.000 --> 00:48.280
Hello, Comic-Con! Hello, San Diego! Thank you so much! God, I've been hydrating for you all day.

00:48.280 --> 00:54.760
I got so drunk yesterday and I made up my mind. We're not doing a bad show for San Diego. Thank

00:54.760 --> 01:00.480
you guys for coming out. We're in competition with Star Wars, Star Trek, Muppet movies,

01:00.480 --> 01:06.860
whatever. Every major corporation that has anything to sell is selling it tonight at Nerd

01:06.860 --> 01:13.240
Dance, NerdCan. This is the pop cultural epicenter of the year and of the country and these are the,

01:13.240 --> 01:23.840
it looks like, 500 people or so that really loved us above all else. And we owe them an amazing show.

01:23.840 --> 01:31.680
I will not leave this stage until each of you feels like you've got $30 worth of entertainment

01:31.680 --> 01:37.000
and that's not fucking around. I'm going to do whatever I have to do for you,

01:37.000 --> 01:42.760
but that also means I have to guard and protect you against abuses of your time.

01:42.760 --> 01:51.200
But Dan, we have nothing for sale here except entertainment. They didn't buy that at all.

01:51.200 --> 01:56.080
So we all just came from the same yacht. I think that's the most important thing.

01:56.080 --> 01:59.920
Let's talk about the yachts. Actually, you know what? We can wait for that until our guest comes

01:59.920 --> 02:03.680
out because I don't want her to have to wait too long. I'll talk about things that our guest

02:03.680 --> 02:09.240
wasn't there for, like the fact that I got my testicles checked because I felt like I felt

02:09.240 --> 02:15.440
like a small something and I was like, whatever, it's like in the tissues, but not the yacht.

02:15.440 --> 02:23.280
Was it right above your balls? No, that's my penis. I felt something under the underside,

02:23.280 --> 02:28.800
but I was like, I don't know. It's like life is going too good. I'm very happy and very much

02:28.800 --> 02:33.040
in love and I'm working on things that I love and so of course I had to feel around until I found

02:33.040 --> 02:43.200
something. It made me think like I got to go to the doctor. So I went to the doctor and my doctor

02:43.200 --> 02:50.640
is like a bro. He makes jokes. He does bits. So then when he's like, so what's going on? I was

02:50.640 --> 02:54.880
like, I think maybe a lump and he's like, in your butt? In your balls? Sorry, I didn't say in your

02:54.880 --> 03:03.360
butt. You guys are making me nervous. He's like, in your balls and then he felt the balls and so

03:03.360 --> 03:09.680
he's feeling my balls. He's like a guy. He's like a Scrubs character. He's just like a Zach

03:09.680 --> 03:15.280
graphy and kind of like, he's just a bro. And so he's feeling my balls, but I really, I felt, I

03:15.280 --> 03:22.720
didn't really, I touched my nipple. I reached up and I was like, I caught myself. He was just

03:22.720 --> 03:29.840
feeling my balls around and I went, I reached up and I touched my nipple because as a reflex.

03:29.840 --> 03:34.240
I don't know. And Cody had told me before, she said like, you touched your nipple when,

03:34.240 --> 03:44.000
what? God damn it. Now I forgot. Oh, okay. Okay. So that's it. Yeah. Why is she off stage for that

03:44.000 --> 03:50.320
line? Because she's not check off. She should be on stage for the action. That's I leave that up

03:50.320 --> 03:54.480
to her. I don't want to play. She's not a performer. She doesn't like the spotlight unless it's

03:54.480 --> 03:58.080
unconditional. But she wants to hold your dick while you pee. Well, yeah, but she wanted to remind

03:58.080 --> 04:01.600
me the story. We were in a hotel and she's like, I want to hold your dick when you pee. A lot of

04:01.600 --> 04:04.960
people will testify to this. This is the kind of stuff that's not politically correct, but it's

04:04.960 --> 04:10.000
like, like, it's something that people do. It sounds romantic as hell. Can I aim your wiener

04:10.000 --> 04:15.920
while you pee? And she told me that I was touching my nipple while she was doing it. I was like,

04:15.920 --> 04:19.120
no, I wasn't. Because there's nothing really sexual about it. It was just a favor for a friend.

04:19.120 --> 04:23.920
Like, there you go. That's like coming to the firehouse and you go like, don't play with matches

04:23.920 --> 04:30.400
and okay, here's what a hose is like. She said, you touched your nipple. I was like, no, I didn't

04:30.400 --> 04:34.800
because I was like, but then the doctor was like checking my testicles and I was like playing

04:34.800 --> 04:41.040
with my nipple. Right. And then I went, so what I'm saying is we're all the same.

04:43.840 --> 04:46.320
I think what you're saying is we're all a little different.

04:49.280 --> 04:54.400
No, we're all the same. Now it's always the same nipple when she was holding your wiener and he

04:54.400 --> 04:58.640
was checking your balls. Is it left hand to left nipple? I don't know. I mean, I don't know what

04:58.640 --> 05:02.400
I did when she was helping me. But I remember this because I remember the sensation of me going

05:02.400 --> 05:06.560
like, what am I doing? Because I was like, I was like shifting around for him. I was like,

05:06.560 --> 05:11.280
on the bottom side. And then I was like, neat. Do you think it's a more of a comfort thing

05:11.280 --> 05:15.680
than a sexual thing? Or is it, are those two things related? Well, I think that things that

05:15.680 --> 05:19.920
give you comfort is anything that gives you comfort is a potential addiction and addiction is like

05:19.920 --> 05:24.320
your neurology growing around something. So as my therapist says, if you have your first drink

05:24.320 --> 05:28.560
when you're 12 years old, like the experience you have is, oh my God, I had a cup of this stuff and

05:28.560 --> 05:33.200
it had, I had a great night. So it's not the same when you do it when you're 16. And it's not the

05:33.200 --> 05:37.760
same when you do it when you're 32 because your neurology like develops a relationship around

05:37.760 --> 05:43.680
the process. So you have no idea at any given time, if you think you're doing what you want to do,

05:43.680 --> 05:48.400
it might be something that your brain thinks you want to do because wanting to want to do it

05:48.400 --> 05:54.640
makes you want to feel, want to, want to, want to. Like it does it, it might just be garbage. And

05:54.640 --> 06:00.160
then you have to combine that with, gee, I wonder if we're vulnerable to an oligarchy hypnotizing

06:00.160 --> 06:06.000
us on a mass scale and doctorinating our values to a left and right margin. Do you think Dr.

06:06.000 --> 06:15.040
Braff, your doctor, do you think somebody whose job is to put fingers in that many butts and touch

06:15.040 --> 06:19.680
that many balls for lumps and for serious reasons, sees a certain range of behavior,

06:19.680 --> 06:24.240
like a lot of nipple touching or a lot of, I don't know, man, like, like neck scratching or,

06:24.240 --> 06:28.640
he seems like the kind of guy that would definitely, if he had seen, if he thought there was a joke to

06:28.640 --> 06:33.920
be had, he would have made it. Like this is a guy like, he does bits. He's like a funny Beverly

06:33.920 --> 06:41.280
Hills doctor. He's a bro. He's a bro. Don't we go to the same doctor? No, same office. Same

06:41.280 --> 06:46.560
office, but you get some classic. Yeah, my guy thinks he's funny, but he's really not funny.

06:46.560 --> 06:51.360
That's every doctor. Like, I'm sorry if you're a doctor, like, you think you're funny, but

06:51.360 --> 07:00.080
people are terrified. They're chuckling nervously. Like, they're like, like, it's weird. If you're

07:00.080 --> 07:05.520
a doctor and you think you're funny, you need to think again, because you work all day with people

07:05.520 --> 07:11.280
who have been, like, basically waterboarded. I haven't had a full, like, medical, like, blood test,

07:11.280 --> 07:15.280
the whole thing. I said, give me the works. I want to know if I'm dying, living forever. Like, I want

07:15.280 --> 07:19.440
to know everything about me. And he gave me the whole stuff and he called me up and he was like,

07:19.440 --> 07:23.600
okay, this is good. This is great. He goes, your liver kidneys are fine. I'm like, what? I couldn't

07:23.600 --> 07:28.080
believe that, by the way. I never can. He keeps telling me my liver's great. I'm like, if you say

07:28.080 --> 07:36.240
so. Maybe his liver scanner is off or maybe the thumpet. But he goes, you, I don't know,

07:36.240 --> 07:41.120
is this one thing that's kind of an anomaly, Jeff, you're just a little bit of, like, density in

07:41.120 --> 07:44.960
your red blood cells. Maybe you need to get a little more folic acid, B vitamins in your diet.

07:44.960 --> 07:51.680
I said, well, I am vegetarian. And he goes, I thought you were a Libra. And I paused. I paused

07:51.680 --> 07:58.800
on the phone for as long as I could. Like, I think eight seconds. And I said, I'm sorry, I was just

07:58.800 --> 08:06.000
putting that on your chart. So that's the thing. Okay. I want to, by the way, Spencer, how are

08:06.000 --> 08:16.800
you? Oh, I'm great. Yeah. No. It's, it's, uh, yeah, this is great. I just sit here and I get

08:16.800 --> 08:23.200
applause. It's amazing. I was kicking up the street, walking up the road from down by the, the, uh,

08:23.200 --> 08:27.840
the marina up to the theater here at the Balboa. And I just walked by Spencer and he's like,

08:27.840 --> 08:32.320
Hey, man, how's it going? Something made so much sense about just walking by Spencer at

08:32.320 --> 08:36.880
Comic Con. And it felt so good. Well, yes and no, because Spencer doesn't dig crowds and like

08:36.880 --> 08:42.400
people. So this is simultaneously, this is definitely, this is the place where you'd be most

08:42.400 --> 08:50.160
like regarded and simultaneously probably most possibly unhappy. Oh yeah. Both of those things.

08:51.520 --> 08:56.480
No, it's great. People, people say hi. They're just like, Oh, Spencer. And I'm like, Oh, you.

08:56.480 --> 09:02.160
Except, except you fucking bolted back to that yacht when those Game of Thrones people showed up.

09:02.160 --> 09:08.160
Oh, no, I was on a very specific and private Aaron. It was great. Getting, getting weed. Oh,

09:08.160 --> 09:15.840
no. That was the public part of the air. Dan yacht spoilers. Yeah. Come on. No, no,

09:15.840 --> 09:21.360
no, I was typing about it that we came from, but why don't we bring out our guest? She plays

09:21.360 --> 09:46.720
Summer on Rick and Morty Spencer Crittenden here. I think. Yeah. Hello, Spencer. Hello. Oh, God.

09:46.720 --> 09:51.840
We have, we have a, we have a surfer to Spencer's up here. We're being surfered. Yeah. I didn't

09:51.840 --> 09:56.240
realize that they were talking about you. Yeah. Sorry. They kept saying Spencer on the way over

09:56.240 --> 10:00.560
and it's like that at the office. They're like, Oh, Spencer's coming. And I'm like, I haven't

10:00.560 --> 10:06.320
heard about this at all. Spencer has to record and Spencer to this. Yeah. Can I,

10:06.320 --> 10:15.600
should I go by Carl tonight? I'll be Carl. Okay. It'll work. It's a good name. No, no,

10:15.600 --> 10:21.120
it's not. I don't know. That's, I think it's a worse name. Sorry. Carl's the worst name.

10:21.120 --> 10:27.120
There's probably Carl's out there. I hope so. Give a middle name, Spencer. Oh, yeah. What?

10:27.680 --> 10:37.600
Karen. Carl. Both of our middle names start with the sound. Yeah. Oh, my middle name is not

10:37.600 --> 10:44.000
actually Carl. I just, it's worse than Carl, which I've called a terrible name. So I'll lose if I

10:44.000 --> 10:50.240
reveal it. What's your middle name? We can all look it up. Yeah. No, look it up. You and I

10:50.240 --> 10:57.040
am DB. I am to be proud. I'm going to the script templates on Final Draft. Did you write a script

10:57.040 --> 11:04.800
for me? Where the fuck is the community in Rick and Morty? Open from, come on. Come on. What's

11:04.800 --> 11:11.520
your middle, what's your, what's your middle name? Spencer. Mine? Yeah. Karen. Karen. Yeah.

11:11.520 --> 11:16.560
Kay. With a K. Yeah. Spencer. I don't know how. See what spell it? C.

11:20.560 --> 11:29.440
Q. C-H. Koran. It's a different Joe. I'm sorry, you guys. I'm not even, what are you doing?

11:29.440 --> 11:34.080
What are you doing? I'm sorry. There's a podcast. We're literally just, I'm opening up old drafts

11:34.080 --> 11:37.600
of scripts. What's going on? It's like looking through, this is Steve Levy's laptop, so I won't

11:37.600 --> 11:42.560
dig too hard. Let's go through, let's go through Steve Levy's shit right now. Let's even have an

11:42.560 --> 11:51.360
opportunity. Let's see his photos. Oh shit. Find some, all right. Those are like nice people.

11:51.360 --> 12:01.840
That was his fraternity. Sigma Pi. Aw. Okay. Behind the scenes. Aw. He's so cute. Look at him.

12:01.840 --> 12:10.000
That was his first girlfriend. Oh my God. Or his mother. Find a folder. Oh, was that me? Go back.

12:11.680 --> 12:20.320
I'm hungab like un-gab. All right. Wait, check out those emojis. That might tell us something.

12:20.320 --> 12:25.920
Okay, we got black. Look at these recently used emojis. The black Dan is a popular one. I gotta

12:25.920 --> 12:32.080
say. What's a photo? I know it's a photo, Dan. Well, what do you want to go to those emojis?

12:32.080 --> 12:37.840
They're already there. These are the recently used emojis. They tell you his story. No one's

12:37.840 --> 12:43.120
asking you to click on it. We're looking to glean information about Steve Levy. Why is the snowman

12:43.120 --> 12:50.080
the first one? That's what I want to know. What kind of monster? This one. This one. Shy monkey,

12:50.080 --> 12:56.720
I know about. The Shy Monkey, Steve Levy, like any number of Shy Monkeys. Yeah, see no evil monkey.

12:57.440 --> 13:03.520
He does that every time. Cody and I, for instance, we have a thing where every time you talk about

13:03.520 --> 13:11.600
when he's on your dick to pee. We'll try to trick Steve Levy. We'll go, hey, does the PR department

13:11.600 --> 13:18.240
have one photo or something? Can I send you one? And then we'll send him a photo that Cody took

13:18.240 --> 13:24.880
of me laying on a hotel bed with my balls hanging out of my underwears. And he keeps, and then

13:24.880 --> 13:31.360
there's all the Shy Monkey responses. But also, can we talk about your balls in that photo, Dan,

13:31.360 --> 13:37.120
because your balls look spectacular in that photo. They're almost admitting their own light.

13:40.080 --> 13:44.480
This is amazing. His photo roll, he's such a company man. Yeah, really. There's gotta be one

13:44.480 --> 13:50.640
weird dick pic in here, some horrible thing. There's gonna be one, yeah, it's gonna be like this.

13:50.640 --> 14:02.240
There we go. Oh, so cute. Marlon Brando. Tindermuch. Stanley. Oh, that's a real monkey. What is

14:02.240 --> 14:08.560
that? That's a dick pic. That's a weird dick pic. Oh, that is. His dick looks like weird turkey

14:08.560 --> 14:14.880
jerky. Oh, this is something we can analyze. Somebody's gonna crush him. That's his sister,

14:14.880 --> 14:24.000
right? Okay. Oh, I have a crush. Okay, all right. He loves his family. Okay, we've been in that

14:24.000 --> 14:29.760
too. This is so unethical. You know what, this could blow back on me. Yeah, no shit. I hear

14:29.760 --> 14:34.240
I'm thinking, like, let's go through his underwear. Like, dude, like, you know, you're gonna find your

14:34.240 --> 14:38.640
bag of cocaine in his underwear. Like, yeah, he's like, he's sitting back there going, I don't,

14:38.640 --> 14:43.360
yeah, keep going, motherfucker. It's just gonna be a receipt for your shot therapy. That's what the

14:43.360 --> 14:51.120
snowman means. It's a cocaine snowman. Why is number one emoji on this thing snowman? That

14:51.120 --> 14:58.320
means he's clearly a dealer. Right, yeah, is it snowing in LA? Or is it snowing in San Diego?

14:58.320 --> 15:02.480
Maybe he moonlights as one of Santa's elves. Steve, do you want to come out and defend yourself?

15:02.480 --> 15:06.080
Possibility. Steve, Steve Levy, everybody, just bring him out, Steve Levy.

15:11.520 --> 15:16.800
Oh, man. Let's talk about that snowman first. What's the deal? And then I want to talk about

15:16.800 --> 15:26.160
how many black Santas he used. What? It's true. Don't look it up. I didn't hear her. Yeah, it's

15:26.160 --> 15:33.920
true. What's the question? Snowman. Spill. I use that for, like, hugs.

15:39.840 --> 15:45.840
Because it's like a snowman. He's got his arms out. Right. And he's made of ice. And you hug him

15:45.840 --> 15:54.080
and he'll melt and die. And he's not of woman born. He's a fucking robot. And you're...

15:54.080 --> 16:00.240
The children say he could dance and play just as much as you and me.

16:01.840 --> 16:05.040
All right. Well, what do you guys want the community movie to be about? Because I got to

16:05.040 --> 16:14.160
start writing a page. So Troy, he's on a pirate ship that he's taken over because he was a captive

16:14.160 --> 16:18.320
off-screen. Every once in a while, I'm going to write a page a minute. So, does anybody have a

16:18.320 --> 16:26.560
timer? Yeah, yeah. Oh, this is what Steve's crate at. Logistics. He's like, I have a timer. Oh,

16:26.560 --> 16:30.480
this is a terrible, wait, this is a terrible template. I don't know why. This is how I met your

16:30.480 --> 16:39.440
mother. I need to speak here. Don't go to open recent because that's revealing some secret

16:39.440 --> 16:46.000
project we're working on. Dan, I want to take, like, six strips of paper and I want to hand

16:46.000 --> 16:49.360
these out to people. I just want lines of dialogue that somebody might say in this. I

16:49.360 --> 16:55.200
just want a neutral line of dialogue. Maybe Dan will use it. I think ask them who has a pen

16:55.200 --> 17:03.680
first. Yeah, don't let them take any pens from us. We'll need those for later. And you ready?

17:04.800 --> 17:10.320
Well, let me... I want to do an act thing. Somehow get stuck on outlines.

17:10.320 --> 17:15.040
Well, whatever. It's act one. I mean, you'll know that. Like, we'll have a writer's assistant clean

17:15.040 --> 17:18.400
this up. It sounds good. James, you're new. I don't think that's...

17:18.400 --> 17:21.680
Yeah, let's change up here. Alright, here we go.

17:22.240 --> 17:25.760
Pirate ship interior. So one minute and then we'll get back to the show. Alright, let's do it.

17:25.760 --> 17:28.400
And Jeff, you can read what I'm writing for the people that are listening to us.

17:28.400 --> 17:34.080
Interior pirate ship captain's cabin. She's closer to you. Yeah.

17:34.080 --> 17:39.280
I don't know anything about the community that well. So you'll have to give me names.

17:39.280 --> 17:45.440
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'll... I'm pausing. I'm pausing.

17:46.480 --> 17:55.600
There we are. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's some... See, what podcast could change fonts to that size

17:55.600 --> 18:00.800
that quickly? But I need to shrink it a little bit. Also, what podcast is writing with the worst

18:00.800 --> 18:09.760
one you set it to? It's an odd choice. Podcast Gold. Sorry, I need to shrink it a little bit.

18:09.760 --> 18:18.640
Oh, geez. You're doing it. Okay. Oh, yes. At his map, or his leisure map.

18:20.560 --> 18:23.920
I want leisure map to be a real thing. It's like a treasure map, but for leisure.

18:23.920 --> 18:32.000
X marks the bed. He has a red macaw.

18:34.800 --> 18:39.200
Well, it's dotted also. Oh, very... Yeah, you should know that they're trying to go somewhere.

18:40.160 --> 18:43.840
Yeah. Sorry, there was a macaw. There's a red macaw in the corner.

18:43.840 --> 18:48.400
Wait, is she narrating or... It's a give and take situation right now.

18:48.400 --> 18:58.240
Ghost writing. This is what real writing is, you guys. Treasure! Treasure, I'm holding it.

18:58.240 --> 19:05.120
Of course. This is my best red macaw impression. Someone needs to enter now. Yeah, there we go.

19:07.040 --> 19:13.040
A girl? Can it be... Oh, male. Okay, damn it. Can we make him peg legs?

19:13.040 --> 19:18.880
And that's a minute. We did it. That's a minute. Damn it.

19:20.960 --> 19:27.200
And a powered male. Finally, a white powered male. Okay, all right. Unsettled.

19:27.200 --> 19:28.960
How I met your mother three is the perfect title.

19:30.800 --> 19:34.480
Well, let's put that on the desktop next to Jordan Levy resume. Okay.

19:34.480 --> 19:42.960
Wait, heck am I? Unsettled. How am I... Man, I should not have used my mother three.

19:42.960 --> 19:45.280
Better mine than dance. Yeah, that would be nice.

19:45.280 --> 19:50.080
All right, let's talk about dogs, racism, comic-con, sexual harassment.

19:50.080 --> 19:53.120
What about the boat party? Let's talk about this yacht party.

19:53.120 --> 19:57.680
Are we done? Is that all we're doing now? Okay, Levy, didn't you get a tarot card reading?

19:59.200 --> 20:01.440
She was a hack. Did Cody tell you what she said?

20:01.440 --> 20:04.480
I was there. Yeah, well, she texted me to ask you about it.

20:06.880 --> 20:14.560
He's going to find love. So Cody... No, it was James and his wife,

20:14.560 --> 20:19.520
Roxy, they were like, oh, man, tarot cards. You guys, you should get your tarot read.

20:19.520 --> 20:22.320
And then I was like, I don't know. That sounds kind of strange.

20:22.320 --> 20:24.880
And that's not for me. This is how everyone gets their tarot card just read.

20:24.880 --> 20:29.280
Yeah. Well, okay, so Cody comes and she's like, you're doing it. And she sits me down and this lady,

20:29.280 --> 20:34.640
she's like, asked me questions. Well, she asked me to shuffle the deck. I shuffled the deck.

20:34.640 --> 20:37.440
She's like, what do you want to know? What's a question you want answered?

20:38.720 --> 20:45.200
And I said, I don't know, something about balance. How do I get balance in my life?

20:45.200 --> 20:47.280
Sure. Typical question. Yeah.

20:49.840 --> 20:56.720
And Cody's like, no, that's a bad question. Say, like, ask about your love life. And I was like,

20:56.720 --> 21:01.520
all right, let's do something about my love life. Ask them about something they've rehearsed answering.

21:03.280 --> 21:09.360
They're like, I don't know. Snickers. Come on, ask me, what are the three things you're supposed

21:09.360 --> 21:13.920
to ask so I can do my cold reading technique? So she goes, okay, so you want to figure out

21:13.920 --> 21:17.280
how to balance your work life with love life and all this other stuff? And I was like, yeah,

21:17.280 --> 21:22.240
sure, that's great. All right, shuffle the deck, put the cards out on the table. And then she's

21:22.240 --> 21:29.600
like, okay, pick five cards. And I picked five cards. And she put them in this weird cross.

21:31.520 --> 21:35.440
And she went, whoa, you got some weird cards. This is weird.

21:36.720 --> 21:43.760
And she gave you your money back. That'll be $85. Sorry, I can't help you. Weird cards.

21:44.640 --> 21:48.960
It's like when you take a Honda to the mechanic. And then she was like,

21:48.960 --> 21:53.600
she gives you like a one sentence readout, like a broad like, okay, here's the deal.

21:53.600 --> 21:56.800
And I don't really remember what she said. It was one of something along the lines of like,

21:59.440 --> 22:00.240
no, continue.

22:02.720 --> 22:06.960
I bet she, yeah, it sounds like she was like, oh, this is weird.

22:06.960 --> 22:10.960
Okay, so what did she say, Levy? She said you were going to meet a girl from a crowd of

22:10.960 --> 22:17.600
no, she said, she said, you need to focus on work right now. Work is your life. You got to keep

22:17.600 --> 22:23.760
working really hard because work is your love life. Because now it's not the time for anything

22:23.760 --> 22:31.360
else in your life. Except for work. I agree. And she said, no, I slipped her a hundred

22:31.360 --> 22:37.120
before. Just tell him work is his future. Cody, Cody looked at me and she went, oh,

22:37.120 --> 22:42.800
this woman's a hack and then stopped listening instantly. Yeah. And then I was like, okay,

22:42.800 --> 22:46.320
explain to me these cards. And she was like, okay, look, you got these like pentacles,

22:46.320 --> 22:52.080
which are coins and, and then you have a lot of swords. She was like, there are a lot of

22:52.080 --> 22:57.440
swords. She was like, you got some really rare cards in here. Let me show you how they all

22:57.440 --> 23:05.440
link together. And how are there rare cards that she uses all the time? I didn't put this

23:05.440 --> 23:11.840
Joker in here. It's like cards less chosen, I guess. Or like, whatever. It's heck. Well,

23:11.840 --> 23:17.600
no, but what did she say? So, okay, so she said, okay, she said that it's very clear

23:17.600 --> 23:25.680
you're in an apprenticeship and you're working really hard. And this middle card means this

23:25.680 --> 23:33.520
is a guy physically making coins. And he's working really hard to make coins. So she was

23:33.520 --> 23:38.160
saying like, you know, that's what you're doing. That's like your life right now. That guy is

23:38.160 --> 23:44.480
that guy. And the guy below is like this guy is who's like a who's like a who's like a humble

23:44.480 --> 23:48.720
whatever. And he's working really hard. And then the thing the cards to the left was strength,

23:48.720 --> 23:55.120
was a woman holding a lion's jaw open. And she was like, you're really strong and really great

23:55.120 --> 24:01.280
at what you're doing. And whatever, don't stop because the top card was some kind of sword

24:01.280 --> 24:06.800
thing. It was like a strong sword. And she was like, which means eventually, you will be like

24:06.800 --> 24:11.280
king, you're going to get to where you want to be. You're going to kill me. No, no, no. That's

24:11.280 --> 24:16.240
where this goes. If we're on Game of Thrones. I figured that I'm fine with that. But but but

24:16.240 --> 24:22.640
the card to the right of the center was nine swords down. And she's like, this is a sad card.

24:22.640 --> 24:27.280
This is like you're Jewish. He'll be sad for killing him. This is a huge card. She said that

24:27.280 --> 24:32.560
you're going to have some kind of like emotional turmoil in the future that you'll have to work

24:32.560 --> 24:37.920
through, whether that's like an emotion, like like something internal. Yeah, bold prediction. Yeah.

24:37.920 --> 24:44.880
She really risked a lot. There will be a death in your family. Eventually. I see good times and bad

24:44.880 --> 24:49.840
times. She brought it all back around. It was like, this is not the time for love or anything

24:49.840 --> 24:55.520
else in your life, except for working as an apprentice. And you'll get to where a crewing

24:55.520 --> 25:03.920
disposable income and frequent visits to me, your chiropractor. I mean, tarot card lady. They're

25:03.920 --> 25:10.560
all the same. They're all the same. All right. Back back on community. What is it? Okay. So these

25:10.560 --> 25:17.280
are phrases that I was supposed to work into the I just said. People might write down holy s. Maybe

25:17.280 --> 25:21.280
incorporate some of this dialogue. All right. Can we get like, let's try multitasking. I'm going

25:21.280 --> 25:25.760
to write. I'm going to try to finish this page while we talk about the fact that we were on the

25:25.760 --> 25:29.600
Game of Thrones yacht. Yeah, that was the game of Thrones yacht. It was the Justin

25:29.600 --> 25:36.240
Rylan, Rick and Morty, Alex Hirsch, like, but apparently the Game of Thrones people really

25:36.240 --> 25:41.440
like Rick and Morty. You walked down. Let me set the stage for you. Walk down at the back of the

25:41.440 --> 25:46.960
Marriott into Marina and you go to and I went through the gate and I said, where do we go? We're

25:46.960 --> 25:50.480
on the F dock. Yeah, you see that boat down there? The one with the smokestack. I'm like,

25:50.480 --> 25:57.280
the one that looks like the old yachts. I thought we're going to be on some like crappy little boat

25:57.280 --> 26:02.960
and we'd all be jammed on like a little tiny thing. It was this big ass yacht. And but like old

26:02.960 --> 26:10.240
timey, it's a 1929 yacht called High Spirits. And it looks like the like the Rockefellers might

26:10.240 --> 26:15.360
have fucked on that but yacht at one point. And there was there was veggie burgers and sliders

26:15.360 --> 26:20.400
on top. And I didn't see those. You didn't go on top. No, I only did. I stopped when all of the

26:20.400 --> 26:25.680
Game of Thrones people were there. I got stuck. Spencer, you're nerding out. We have to get code

26:25.680 --> 26:33.680
on which Spencer. I'll call you Carl. Carl and grammar. Yeah. Okay. Spencer G. Yeah. What up?

26:33.680 --> 26:39.200
What up? I didn't even cross your path, but then I'm walking through one of the like areas of the

26:39.200 --> 26:43.200
boat like around the bow and I turn a corner and I see a guy and he's this kind of good looking

26:43.200 --> 26:50.320
chubby dude. And I look and it's Samwell. Yeah. Like the guy that likes books. He killed the white.

26:50.320 --> 26:56.160
He killed the white Walker with the dragon glass. I just walking through. I didn't know that there

26:56.160 --> 27:02.720
was ever going to be Game of Thrones people. And I go, I try to go, Oh, and I put my hand out and he

27:02.720 --> 27:07.920
gives me like his kind of, you know, it's like kind of nervous, like Samwell hands. Is that his name?

27:07.920 --> 27:15.600
Samwell? I think so. Yeah. And he goes, Hey, I go, Oh, shit. I don't know his name. I'm like,

27:15.600 --> 27:20.640
I love you on the show. And he goes, Oh, that's really nice. I'm like, Jesus Christ. Then I turn

27:20.640 --> 27:26.080
the corner and there's Ramsey. Yeah. Everybody's there. He's a lot less pale in real life. Also,

27:26.080 --> 27:31.120
he's, he's, he's, he's, he's, he's quite, he's quite small. I didn't officially get to meet Ramsey,

27:31.120 --> 27:35.840
although he said, excuse me, as he walked by, I was, I walked up, I was, there were shots and

27:35.840 --> 27:42.480
Justin was doing shots and fucking Ramsey Bolton was doing shots. And his arms were sinewy and

27:43.120 --> 27:50.240
veins. And he's like, his veins and biceps. And then he spoke and he said, he was the same guy.

27:50.240 --> 27:54.880
He said, that's the thing about the Game of Thrones people. I've never been that big a fan of

27:54.880 --> 28:01.360
anything that everybody has, all their faces were like, you're the guy, you're the person.

28:01.360 --> 28:11.200
And the, the, one of the actors was, she was the unassuming jolly lady. It was drinking and

28:11.200 --> 28:16.560
everybody's like, like, like, and she goes, I think her friend said, do you know who this is?

28:17.440 --> 28:21.360
And she's like, give her the look and she like makes this look. And I'm like, wait, I know that

28:21.360 --> 28:26.480
look. And it's like, she's, she's, she's, she's the, she's the girl who truly has no name, who like

28:26.480 --> 28:32.720
stabs Arya. She's the fucking terminator of the. She is the terminator of a Game of Thrones.

28:32.720 --> 28:39.760
Everybody on the ship, there was a, Sir No Fingers and you know, I don't, Sir No Fingers was on

28:39.760 --> 28:45.840
there. I mean, they say his character is going to come back from the dead, Sir No Fingers. He's

28:45.840 --> 28:49.760
going to grow all of his fingers back. The guy who, the guy who tried to close the deal at the

28:49.760 --> 28:56.720
Iron Bank by going, look, he's, he's, he's great at accounting. That guy was hanging out. Everybody,

28:56.720 --> 29:03.360
everybody was, Spencer, Spencer G, you were saying that there was Davos? That's him, Davos, Sir No

29:03.360 --> 29:09.280
Fingers. And, and, and the eunuch, the eunuch, Varys, Varys was there. I didn't see anything.

29:09.280 --> 29:16.080
Wait, Varys was there? Varys was there because he had, and he had a tan. And so nobody recognized

29:16.080 --> 29:20.720
him. He just looked like George Hamilton. My husband has known him for many years because he

29:20.720 --> 29:24.720
has done, he worked in the London Theater. My, my husband was a firefighter, so he would work the,

29:24.720 --> 29:28.880
the fire department stuff that they did. I don't know, they just walked shows basically. So he's

29:28.880 --> 29:35.120
known him forever and he's Irish. And, and when I watched Game of Thrones, like, I really attracted

29:35.120 --> 29:40.640
to him. So it was really awkward. To the eunuch? Tonight. Yeah, I know. It's weird. I know. It's

29:40.640 --> 29:48.480
okay. I'm dealing with it. So, so I was, I was shocked and amazed that I had like a 10 minute

29:48.480 --> 29:57.440
conversation with him. That's my husband back there. I wish firefighter you're here. What's your

29:57.440 --> 30:12.240
name, sir? James. James. Hello, James. James. Um, but yeah, it was really amazing. Were you there on the yacht too, James? No, I mean, I'm

30:12.240 --> 30:17.120
embellishing now that I know they are here. Well, he's a eunuch, so it's fine. Exactly. Nothing can

30:17.120 --> 30:22.560
happen. Yeah. Yeah. And he got his revenge. He got that whatever his name is. Is the guy in the box?

30:22.560 --> 30:26.720
That potion guy in the box. How come we've never figured out where that box guy went to? He just,

30:26.720 --> 30:29.600
he's somewhere. He just carries him with him every time he's traveling. Yeah, I don't know. It was just

30:29.600 --> 30:34.160
like a glimpse of his back story. Right? And then it never got revealed later. I mean, can they bring

30:34.160 --> 30:38.240
that back? There was a backdoor pilot about the box wizard that HBO was trying to shop around. They were

30:38.240 --> 30:43.280
going to do like a spin-off. The box wizard. Yeah, I feel like the rally were. Hello. My name's

30:43.280 --> 30:53.440
Amanda Faes Langwermer. Years ago, I horribly mutilated a child to get red magic from my blood

30:53.440 --> 31:01.520
to get the blood magic. I had no idea. He's gonna be like, this is my story. It was rough. It was

31:01.520 --> 31:08.080
a rough episode. Okay. It was pretty, it was pretty amazing, actually, because I didn't really know

31:08.080 --> 31:11.440
what to expect to go on to that yacht. I thought I was just going to be like, I don't slam people,

31:11.440 --> 31:15.920
I'm rick and morty people, and then like the entire cast of Game of Thrones was there. So it was

31:15.920 --> 31:20.720
just a rick and morty and game of thrones party, which I thought was extremely exclusive. And I had

31:20.720 --> 31:27.280
no idea I fit into that crowd, like a hall-aged crowd. I was at the indigo room earlier.

31:29.280 --> 31:32.720
I had gotten the boat quite early before anybody was there. We got on very early,

31:32.720 --> 31:38.640
my friend and I, and we came in there, and it's a boat built in 1929, and I'm six with four with

31:38.640 --> 31:45.280
like heels on my shoes, like dress shoes. So I had to duck everywhere I go. So I'm hodor. I'm

31:45.280 --> 31:50.880
walking through, like, I'm walking through things. And so I'm meeting people that are on Game of Thrones

31:50.880 --> 31:58.160
who are quite, we, and, but, so I'm talking to them. Hello. Like I, my head is tilted. I didn't

31:58.160 --> 32:03.120
like that. I felt like a weird character in the Game of Thrones. And apparently, so last night,

32:03.120 --> 32:07.440
the rumors spread throughout the adult swim party that hodor was a DJ, and then he was DJing at

32:07.440 --> 32:14.720
this club. The Omnia. So everybody was like, let's go see hodor DJ. And we went. So you and I and

32:14.720 --> 32:18.880
Ryan Ridley and like a bunch of other people went to this club that was like, we were all dressed

32:18.880 --> 32:24.480
like San Diego tourists. And the club was like velvet rope and just like very like, it was,

32:24.480 --> 32:29.760
it was like. And they spray this like cold air. Like no one from Comic Con was like,

32:30.960 --> 32:35.760
you know, it was like, it was like bottle service, kind of like grody, grody chic. And,

32:36.400 --> 32:40.320
and then like, I got a text from somebody that I texted in a Hail Mary, and they said,

32:40.320 --> 32:45.440
say this. And I said what they said and they were like, all right, come on in. And we were like,

32:45.440 --> 33:03.600
and it was like. And we were like, hold on. But like hodor wasn't there. But like Ridley and I

33:03.600 --> 33:09.920
were just like, hold on. And we were also high and drunk. And so Ridley was like, Ridley was like

33:09.920 --> 33:14.080
dancing like in the front row of this thing. And I was just like whispering in his ear doing like

33:14.080 --> 33:18.240
this hodor rap, like to the beat. I was like, hold door, hold the door, gonna hold the door,

33:18.240 --> 33:21.760
and then hold three more, gonna hold those doors and hold it's more, gonna hold every door, and

33:21.760 --> 33:27.440
you go to the wall, hold on, go in the wall of World War three, gonna hold on, gonna hold the

33:27.440 --> 33:30.800
door for me, gonna hold the door, and then hold four doors, gonna hold some more doors, and then

33:30.800 --> 33:38.240
hold them all on. And he was like crying. And then we left like in five minutes. You left the

33:38.240 --> 33:43.520
meeting. And you're like, bye. I need earplugs. We hung out for five minutes, I did hodor jokes,

33:43.520 --> 33:49.360
and then we left. Apparently hodor had been up there before we got there. Sorry, because I ran

33:49.360 --> 33:56.800
into Jonah Ray. And he was like, did you guys go to the hodor show? And I was like, no, I guess he

33:56.800 --> 34:00.960
didn't go to opera. And he's like, no, he was up before you guys got there. And it was like, so, okay,

34:00.960 --> 34:05.920
so what happened? He's like, he's just like a giant DJ. And he, and he was like, I guess he's like

34:05.920 --> 34:12.080
Swedish or who knows what, you know, and like, we only says one word anyway. He only says like

34:13.280 --> 34:16.800
flow, flow more. That's Jeff, that's Jeff. That's Jeff.

34:16.800 --> 34:25.280
You should be DJ flow more. But, but he's like, Jonah said, like, yeah, he came up and was like,

34:27.280 --> 34:33.280
like, go figure. And then he did that for a while and I was like, yay. And then, and then at one

34:33.280 --> 34:38.000
point he dropped the beat and was like, how's everybody doing tonight? And, and, and everyone

34:38.000 --> 34:49.600
went, hold on. And he went, he like shook it off. Like, we don't know if what did he think was

34:49.600 --> 34:53.520
going to happen? We don't know if he was bummed out. Like, does that mean he was he hated it?

34:53.520 --> 35:01.120
Or that's just from the Cirque du Soleil was here nine years ago. That was the last feather.

35:01.120 --> 35:08.640
Actually, yeah, there's still acid on that. Yeah, he, I mean, I like that. It's like,

35:08.640 --> 35:12.480
like Jonah raised impression of Hodor just like, he just, he just, it's like a golden retriever

35:12.480 --> 35:18.480
coming out of a swamp. But we don't know loves it hates it. Well, who cares? He just like,

35:19.520 --> 35:28.320
time to get back to French. And he's like, how's everybody doing? Hold on. That's just a job.

35:28.320 --> 35:32.880
Everybody, the Game of Thrones people are super chill and they're able to be because they're

35:32.880 --> 35:41.360
all foreigners. They don't like, they are like, like, like, like, Sam Well, who you see Sam Well,

35:41.360 --> 35:48.240
like, like, you haven't lived, like this guy, but he looked exactly like you all look exactly like

35:48.240 --> 35:52.560
what they are. You give him one, you give him one fur vest and he's fucking ready to go exactly the

35:52.560 --> 35:59.520
fucking dudes like the guy Davos had the fucking beardage. It's all just hanging out and vaping

35:59.520 --> 36:04.080
and stuff. And I was like, and Sam Well had this fucking, he was just dressed like fucking like

36:04.080 --> 36:09.280
a, like a, like a cool street magician. But he was like, but he's Sam Well, and I'm not saying

36:09.280 --> 36:12.640
like he wasn't, he's not, he wasn't trying to pull anything off. Like he looked great. Like,

36:12.640 --> 36:16.080
but he's just like, and you're like, Oh yeah, you look, you look great, but he's not Sam Well,

36:16.080 --> 36:20.320
he's not wearing a leather cloak today, but he was like hanging out a black button up shirt.

36:20.320 --> 36:25.760
And he's like, yeah, hey. And I was like, so they're all from like Manchester and, and, and,

36:25.760 --> 36:29.680
and Belfast and all this stuff and they shoot in all these different cities. And so they just,

36:29.680 --> 36:34.400
this was like their fourth Comic Con. And they, and I was like, I just kept asking the same question

36:34.400 --> 36:38.480
over and over again, which is like, how do you handle it? How do you do it? How do you bum? And

36:38.480 --> 36:41.840
I think they, that's the question we all ask them because we're all those like, Oh, what would

36:41.840 --> 36:46.160
happen if you ever had this much? And I think because they're from Europe, they're kind of like,

36:46.160 --> 36:51.520
they don't really even understand that question. Like, and not in a like a high roadie, humble,

36:51.520 --> 36:56.640
braggy way. It's like, well, they don't, they don't have the same culture. And so it's like,

36:56.640 --> 37:00.240
they're kind of like, this is amazing. And then they go, they're going to go back to Manchester

37:00.240 --> 37:03.840
and they hang out. I'm sure they're lying, you know, that they go home and they're like, I'm a

37:03.840 --> 37:08.400
fucking God. And they snort a million lines of cocaine. And there's like, fucking three, like

37:08.400 --> 37:13.280
children tied up and they're like, fuck you. I look at my phones all the time. I realized,

37:13.280 --> 37:17.920
I have to get out of here soon to get to the Balboa, do the show. And I went to say goodbye to

37:17.920 --> 37:23.280
you, Dan. So like, I'm, I'm leaving soon. And I looked and Justin Reiland, whom I've known forever,

37:23.280 --> 37:28.000
because like channel 101 and the house of Cosby is and all the stupid stuff that we've made.

37:28.000 --> 37:32.960
And now Rick and Morty and he's up there and he's got like 19 glasses out. And it's just

37:32.960 --> 37:38.240
to keep the shots for all the Game of Thrones people. All of our nerdy friends and some of the

37:38.240 --> 37:43.360
Game of Thrones cast is fucking crazy. It was really cool. Yeah. I can't believe I didn't see

37:43.360 --> 37:49.520
Jairus or Davos. Are you right right now? It was, it was pretty amazing. Yeah. Because I was

37:49.520 --> 37:53.600
watching everybody line up at Holly, it's like my hotel room is from there. So everyone was just

37:53.600 --> 37:58.160
like sleeping and down there. And I was like, God, I kind of wish I was down there too. But I have

37:58.160 --> 38:03.760
our panel today anyway. So to actually meet all of them, like just regular chilling on a boat was

38:03.760 --> 38:09.760
cool. Yeah. I wish that boat just kind of unmoored and just went out to sea. We just like, we'd

38:09.760 --> 38:13.680
probably survive. I mean, they'd know how to do it. I don't know. People were pretty drunk.

38:15.200 --> 38:18.080
It's okay. We can't live on those stale veggie burgers forever.

38:19.680 --> 38:22.080
I didn't have one. So sorry. Actually, they were pretty good.

38:25.120 --> 38:26.080
Were you all on the boat?

38:26.080 --> 38:31.440
Did you see the unfolds it? I mean, it's a treasure map.

38:35.120 --> 38:37.920
It's a movie.

38:47.920 --> 38:51.920
No one knows the words of that fucking. Yeah. It's a little bit for my time.

38:51.920 --> 38:59.120
Wow. It's okay. Spencer T, let's talk about your strappy shoes. You got a back story for

38:59.120 --> 39:03.360
these strappy shoes? They were $15. Oh, damn. They're on sale.

39:05.760 --> 39:10.480
That's a good story. Thanks. No, I was wearing heels earlier and I just was like, fuck it.

39:10.480 --> 39:16.160
This is ridiculous. Thank you. I was wearing heels last night and there were two girls behind

39:16.160 --> 39:21.520
me as I was walking back to our hotel after the Hodor event. And they were like, I can't

39:21.520 --> 39:25.520
believe she's wearing heels. How was she even surviving? I mean, if I had to wear heels and

39:25.520 --> 39:30.320
I was like, I'm not wearing heels tomorrow night. This is embarrassing now. I guess I should have.

39:30.320 --> 39:35.840
I should have a personal chauffeur is what I should have. Can I share a darker side of

39:35.840 --> 39:42.240
Comic-Con with you guys? Please do. Because it's not all fun and games. I got in a cab,

39:42.240 --> 39:49.280
as one does, and the cab driver, he said, you're here for Comic-Con? I said, yes. And he said,

39:49.280 --> 40:00.320
how's your humor? And I said, like the four humors? I said, I don't know. It's, it's not good. I don't,

40:00.320 --> 40:08.000
I don't know. And he said, well, can you tell me what the Joker calls Batman's motorcycle?

40:08.000 --> 40:17.840
And I was like, I kept, I ran through all the racist possibilities. I was like, I don't know,

40:17.840 --> 40:23.920
Chinese, brown, I was just like racist, racist, racist. And then I was like misogyny, misogyny.

40:23.920 --> 40:30.240
Like what is it? How is this, how does this hurt people? Because a cab driver is asking me knock,

40:30.240 --> 40:35.360
knock. So how can the who's there hurt someone? And I was like, I don't know. And he said,

40:35.360 --> 40:40.000
so the question was, can you tell me what Joker calls Batman's motorcycle? And I said, I don't know.

40:40.000 --> 40:47.920
And he said, Yama ha ha ha ha. And then he just kept driving as if he hadn't ruined my day.

40:50.240 --> 40:54.640
He was like, so anyways, left up here. I'm like, left up here. Life means nothing now.

40:54.640 --> 41:00.320
Let me out. Let me out. Yeah, like keep, drive faster and let me fucking jump out.

41:00.320 --> 41:07.440
And just let me dip my head out and just fucking shave back my brain off on the concrete so that

41:07.440 --> 41:13.120
I can lean back up and hopefully just fit in until I die. That never, never might be.

41:13.120 --> 41:17.840
This is. It's so parallel to a joke. I heard a long time ago. What is Popeye's favorite book of the

41:17.840 --> 41:28.160
Bible? Have a cook. It's the same joke. It's stupid. Stupid. It's not. All the local businesses,

41:28.160 --> 41:32.160
like it's the constant reminder it's like it's like on one hand we all come together and we all go

41:32.160 --> 41:37.280
we're all not so different and then but then in the form of like the the weight staff and the

41:37.280 --> 41:42.160

kidding we've got some justin roilyn voiced we have okay so we have like i almost want to give

49:28.320 --> 49:32.400
people a choice because i have a 10 minute clip that has nothing that's like it's rick and morty

49:32.400 --> 49:39.840
related and it's like really well done it is good but it's real funny it's i mean you're

49:39.840 --> 49:47.040
gonna be sitting here watching a thing for 10 minutes but it is it's uh so it's there was

49:47.040 --> 49:54.000
this court case that happened um recently and it went viral a little bit sub viral uh it happened

49:54.000 --> 49:59.680
in atlanta georgia it was georgia yeah georgia courthouse uh there was transcripts of the court

49:59.680 --> 50:06.320
case where the guy that uh it was being he was trying to fire his lawyer so he could represent

50:06.320 --> 50:11.040
himself and the judge is like talking to him and going like you shouldn't represent yourself and

50:11.040 --> 50:16.400
it's just a transcript of that but it takes a lot of fucking turns and it's insane like the guy just

50:16.400 --> 50:21.520
starts like yelling at the judge and then after a while the judge like goes around the bend uh and

50:21.520 --> 50:26.160
you like just when you think you know who you're rooting for i don't know but it was how many

50:26.160 --> 50:30.400
of you are familiar with what i'm talking about just by a father okay so it's like yeah it went

50:30.400 --> 50:34.320
kind of sub viral it like you know there was a Kardashian doing something that day it was like

50:34.320 --> 50:38.320
it didn't it didn't quite make it but like when it was at its peak and we were like reading it in

50:38.320 --> 50:42.400
the writers room rick and morty and then erica haze like one of our favorite storyboard artists

50:42.400 --> 50:46.640
at rick and morty justin reander her and said like can you just draw let's do because we were

50:46.640 --> 50:50.640
reading it out loud and i was like we should just do this like like and get it out put it on youtube

50:51.600 --> 50:56.320
so it was like draw rick and morty doing this scene and and justin's like yeah like morty should be

50:56.320 --> 51:03.600
the judge and rick should be the uh the plaintiff uh or not the plaintiff the uh defendant yeah

51:03.600 --> 51:09.520
because it's the guy so so we do erica haze like uh like like i mean she fucking scrambled on it her

51:09.520 --> 51:16.400
her art is so great it's like like uh and justin like like recorded it in in the bay and like um

51:16.400 --> 51:21.520
it's it won't seem like 10 minutes in my opinion because i played it for you yeah it's the audio

51:21.520 --> 51:24.960
and it's like it goes by pretty quick but i would like it to be an hour i think the important thing

51:24.960 --> 51:29.600
you have to understand is that this is word for word literally verbatim you can look it up online

51:29.600 --> 51:36.240
this is absolutely word for word um not a single word is different from the actual court transcript

51:36.240 --> 51:42.800
this actually happened in a courtroom recently in the 21st century without and it wasn't rick and

51:42.800 --> 51:47.600
morty in in the court and it was not rick and morty although it seems like it was it's listening

51:47.600 --> 51:55.040
to and so can we just yeah let's do it oh oh oh you you need this uh

52:00.960 --> 52:04.880
so what i do think for those of you who might be like oh i'm listening to this on audio it

52:04.880 --> 52:11.600
actually no it functions fine as audio is all you're seeing is not very visual two images but but

52:11.600 --> 52:17.120
yeah they work well but i do i also have a clip of season three from season three of rick and

52:17.120 --> 52:23.120
morty but i actually i i actually think this is like this is kind of the i mean i don't know

52:23.680 --> 52:29.600
yeah well it's arguably better but yeah this may never be seen again who knows uh maybe yeah

52:29.600 --> 52:35.280
legally and maybe we can't we don't know yeah but it's like a public document it's like that was

52:36.160 --> 52:42.080
that went over 10 times better than i thought i mean like i that's crazy

52:43.520 --> 52:49.280
that actually all happened yeah i think you stole my phone oh yeah it's because i yeah it was it was

52:49.280 --> 52:55.120
borsa happens it was on my chair so i get to keep it i don't know where your phone is oh i

52:55.120 --> 53:00.800
i pick i feel like i i must admit did you check the other oh deep around the shuttle give it a

53:00.800 --> 53:07.920
blend i did oh yeah fucking amazing for a bag of coffee for a bag i there's so many i mean the guy

53:07.920 --> 53:13.040
like they call him butt man like that's a truck fuck man that's a hero's journey because you don't

53:13.040 --> 53:21.280
know like you start going like well it's probably hard to be a judge like that's the world of common

53:21.280 --> 53:25.760
day as joseph cambell would call it it's like it's probably hard to be a judge like these guys i'm

53:25.760 --> 53:30.720
sure they all have a big opinion about how they should how things should work and boy they're

53:30.720 --> 53:35.600
you know just terrible like hard to deal with and they got nothing to lose and boy what a hard thing

53:35.600 --> 53:39.520
it is to be a judge and then you cross the threshold it's like the threshold for me is like

53:39.520 --> 53:45.520
exactly where the judge goes like you look like a queer and then the guy's like it's like it's like

53:45.520 --> 53:50.880
well yeah as difficult as that guy was being like there was like the subtext to it where he's like

53:50.880 --> 53:55.600
yeah but if i just keep fucking poking you that's what trolling is so he's trolling it and it's

53:55.600 --> 54:01.200
just like if i if it's if it's possible for me to go like this enough that you eventually like

54:01.200 --> 54:07.360
engage in some crazy ass behavior then everything is retroactively invalidated but it's like you

54:07.360 --> 54:11.440
don't deserve to be a judge's robe like because he got him to say like you look like a queer and

54:11.440 --> 54:14.640
he's like you call him a queer i didn't say that i said you look like one but it's like he

54:14.640 --> 54:19.120
fucking popped his cork and he did it in exactly the point where the guy was like you want me to

54:19.120 --> 54:23.760
suck your dick he was like psych like presiding over things and like bureaucratically like doing

54:23.760 --> 54:27.200
his thing because it's like oh this guy wants to suck my dick and all this stuff and then he was

54:27.200 --> 54:30.240
like how about you you want to suck my dick and he's like you know what you look like a queer

54:30.240 --> 54:35.920
and and then the shit went down a crazy road of trials where you're going back and forth like i go

54:35.920 --> 54:40.000
back and forth i'm like well okay the judge i'm on the judge's side and then i'm like on the guy's

54:40.000 --> 54:44.560
side and i don't know and the god the goddess point is of course like it's at the point where you

54:44.560 --> 54:49.280
just think of them as two lovers like you're like these guys are having a good time they're avid

54:49.280 --> 54:53.760
and castello like these guys should just live in an apartment together everything's fine and then

54:53.760 --> 54:58.400
as you reach that equilibrium the atonement with the father is i'm gonna kill your family i'm gonna

54:58.400 --> 55:05.280
kill your babies with a hammer and everyone goes silent everyone goes because there is a moment

55:05.280 --> 55:09.360
and then he goes like yeah he can't because it's like you can't have avid and castello with that

55:09.360 --> 55:17.680
guy he the both the judge and the guy like unwittingly achieved peace on earth by being like these

55:17.680 --> 55:23.520
crazy archetypes like that there were more system than man and then the moment that they had equilibrium

55:23.520 --> 55:28.720
the guy who has to subvert everything was like yeah well i'm isis like i'll fucking like i'll

55:28.720 --> 55:32.480
like i'll take this to a place where you can't like i don't want the i don't want that warmth

55:33.440 --> 55:37.840
i can't have that i like when he says like because there was a moment when they seem to be laughing

55:37.840 --> 55:43.200
and having a good time at one point they're clearly going like okay 20 days 40 days 60 days a year

55:43.200 --> 55:46.960
10 years like you're in contempt like you're like you're not getting out of jail as you're

55:46.960 --> 55:51.760
certainly going to trial and then he says i'll kill your whole family and he goes okay that's a

55:51.760 --> 55:56.240
terrorist threat like that's like a million dollars bond like that's a huge thing to threaten

55:56.240 --> 56:00.560
somebody's life especially a judge that's a felony no matter what happened before that including the

56:00.560 --> 56:06.960
judge saying all the stupid shit he said at that moment um then things become absolutely

56:06.960 --> 56:11.440
he doesn't care anymore then they become cathartic because because the guy's going because then the

56:11.440 --> 56:15.760
judge is whereas previously the judge is going well your mouth isn't big enough for my dick or

56:15.760 --> 56:19.360
my mouth everybody like they're both like again they're like rolling around in the same mud but

56:19.360 --> 56:25.120
when the terrorist threat happens the judge gets back out of the mud and now everything is like

56:25.120 --> 56:29.520
washed out and sad it's like a children's book where all the color has drained because you left

56:29.520 --> 56:33.440
it in the bathtub like it's the pages are puffy and things are just like you feel like it's been

56:33.440 --> 56:38.720
through a fire because then it's just like it's still funny and ironic but it's like now it's sad

56:38.720 --> 56:42.880
because it's just like okay now let's go through the motions you're a criminal i'm a judge like

56:42.880 --> 56:47.120
like there's nothing fun about this let's keep danger at the door i don't but then it's like

56:47.120 --> 56:51.600
then the crazy truth of i don't have a sister i don't have a niece i don't have a wife i don't

56:51.600 --> 56:58.640
have anybody i don't have anyone ever i don't have i was born alone i will die alone and we don't

56:58.640 --> 57:04.480
know i was lying about that i'm timely ripped yes and the fact that he's tracking it to the point

57:04.480 --> 57:10.720
that like only a subredator would when he says why would i have grandkids if i don't have kids

57:11.520 --> 57:17.600
we're like wait why are you tracking this yeah we are what were you logical all of a sudden he's

57:17.600 --> 57:22.720
asking questions than only a person that was like a fan of lost would ask in that moment my favorite

57:22.720 --> 57:27.120
moment of lucidity from the defendant is when after he's gotten contempt of court like oh first

57:27.120 --> 57:32.560
like he puts himself in contempt then he earns actual he holds himself into contempt into contempt

57:32.560 --> 57:37.680
which yeah which is great it's promethean yeah and then he gets then he gets held in the court's

57:37.680 --> 57:42.480
contempt and he's gonna do time and then he threatens the guy's family goes okay we're gonna

57:42.480 --> 57:47.040
get the da on this that's a terrorist threat on my family and he doubles down i'm gonna come

57:47.040 --> 57:51.120
after your whole family everybody and he's like okay well that's that's a terrorist threat and

57:51.120 --> 57:58.560
he goes i don't belong in jail i was framed this lawyer wants to want to suck my dick for a bag of

57:58.560 --> 58:03.840
coffee well do you understand though that that's not he's he he's referring to the bag of coffee

58:03.840 --> 58:10.400
thing he's referring to the crime so everyone wants to suck this guy's dick he the the reason he

58:10.400 --> 58:14.720
has a lawyer was you put his first place is because a guy wanted to suck his big dick for a bag of

58:14.720 --> 58:20.240
coffee that he was framed why can't we get this guy's dick on the witness and he's saying his

58:20.240 --> 58:26.240
lawyer wants to suck his dick or he won't represent him so he's just like he's in a you know a

58:26.240 --> 58:31.600
cycle of like this guy maybe has a beautiful dick like like we don't know or he looks like he's

58:31.600 --> 58:35.760
somebody who would like like maybe we don't know i did i did look i don't think you suck a beautiful

58:35.760 --> 58:39.920
dick for a bag of coffee i think it's his own reward because there's enough racial illusions

58:39.920 --> 58:44.400
in the thing i did look it up because it's like i jack off on white boys and i said there's illusions

58:44.400 --> 58:48.400
to like cracker and stuff like that he's a white guy he's a this is a white guy just so you know

58:48.400 --> 58:51.760
it's like southern court i guess it's like you know that's where like he's you know it's like

58:51.760 --> 58:57.200
he's like i i i i i jack off on white boys like he's like like you it's he also likes white

58:57.200 --> 59:00.960
that he refers to the white boys as white boys but it's not weird when you think about it because

59:00.960 --> 59:05.040
it's like oh it's like this we have this yes we have this like prison system and it's like a class

59:05.040 --> 59:08.720
system and it kind of all actually starts to emerge and make sense oh yeah then he's just like

59:08.720 --> 59:13.440
horrible way uh funniest parts of that though who is the uh the the woman that animate or

59:13.440 --> 59:19.680
do the drawings for that uh erica haze uh the cuts to the the court stenographer yeah maybe

59:20.480 --> 59:29.120
god that was brilliant yeah because he's like i'm just doing my job over here uh yeah i i mean i

59:29.120 --> 59:34.960
don't know you know i look i we should we should show another we should show the rick and morty

59:34.960 --> 59:40.000
clip from the thing because all right yeah yeah let's do it this is just a quick clip honestly

59:40.000 --> 59:43.520
it won't follow that because that audio is so clean you understand you're gonna watch an animatic

59:43.520 --> 59:48.320
we showed the one from the pickle episode at the panel this is a different thing this is an episode

59:48.320 --> 59:56.480
in which uh uh it takes place in a post apocalyptic uh future like a road warrior type uh future and

59:56.480 --> 01:00:12.560
uh they're probably you probably won't you know who knows there's no context it's an animatic

01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:20.080
all right eb white we yeah we satisfied that that end of the agreement we packed this theater

01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:24.480
by promising rick and morty clips and boy we delivered on that certainly nobody could ever

01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:30.960
sue us for that but i'm really fucking dropping the ball in this community script i don't know

01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:35.920

01:10:28.360 --> 01:10:31.240
Thank you.

01:10:31.240 --> 01:10:36.160
He opens his arms as if to hug the world

01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:40.880
and turns into a beam of light.

01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:41.880
Who's next?

01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:53.040
Stuttering kleptomaniac.

01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:55.800
Stuttering kleptomaniac, 34.

01:10:55.800 --> 01:10:56.640
White enters.

01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:00.600
Oh, no.

01:11:00.600 --> 01:11:06.600
I need to steal.

01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:17.600
He wins.

01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:22.080
He wins in Oscar.

01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:23.440
You can just say that in the script?

01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:25.040
So they came back again.

01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:28.040
Everyone explodes.

01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:29.200
OK, all right.

01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:30.760
Community college.

01:11:30.760 --> 01:11:32.440
OK, let's do the actual.

01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:33.440
OK.

01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:35.360
Yeah, so free back down.

01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:38.880
Is that where the, OK, exterior, and there's a building.

01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:39.960
OK.

01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:41.000
OK, all right.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:46.880
Library, like, books.

01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:49.600
OK, Jeff is reading a book.

01:11:49.600 --> 01:11:50.600
Reading a book.

01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:51.600
That's good.

01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:53.240
OK, Annie comes up.

01:11:53.240 --> 01:11:56.000
OK, Britta comes up.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:02.000
OK, Jeff is like, Britta, what do you want?

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:09.000
Annie is like, is this a bad time?

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:15.000
Britta is like, is it a bad time for pollution or something?

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:22.000
Britta, we get it.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:25.000
You're too dimensional.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:30.000
Oh, no.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:48.000
Oh, shit.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:13:05.000
OK, Swippy Goldberg there too, can she come?

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
They look to see Borg-1 as entered.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:11.000
Britta's eyes pop wide like in all the CG gags we did in season 3

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:14.000
that everyone fucking hated and referred to during season 4

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:24.000
as if season 3 was evidence that season 4 was good.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:29.000
It hurts my fucking feelings.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:34.000
I pretty much innocently responded.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:43.000
And I guess it was a slow news day for something.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:46.000
I don't know.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:52.000
I'm not a good person.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:14:03.000
Don't cry for me, Argentina.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:06.000
Someone has a theater degree.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:10.000
Exterior Argentina.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:15.000
All right.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:18.000
Oh, it's a leisure map.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
A leisure map.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:23.000
Jeff, Britta?

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:27.000
Borg, yes.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:30.000
Not you.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:33.000
Britta, what?

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:38.000
Jeff, yes.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:42.000
Am I in the room?

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:53.000
Britta, is anyone really in the room as long as Israel gets 34%

01:14:53.000 --> 01:15:01.000
of our federal fund?

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
Borg-1.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:13.000
I may be a hive mind, but I know a hot button when I sense one.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:18.000
He borks out.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:19.000
He borks out.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:20.000
I would have borked out.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:24.000
And a calling after.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:25.000
Borg-1.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:29.000
Are you Ubering?

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:32.000
Duh hands.

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:33.000
I'm a borg.

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
Aren't...

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
I'm a borg, bitch.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:38.000
Aren't I?

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:39.000
Okay.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:40.000
Any.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:43.000
Okay, that was timely.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:44.000
They leave together.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
What?

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:52.000
Usually I throw stuff like that to a joke room.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:56.000
And they go...

01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:01.000
So, Jeff, so what do you think?

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:10.000
Britta, about all these shootings?

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:11.000
Harambee.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:12.000
No.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
No, about life.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:19.000
Yes, about all these shootings.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:25.000
I'm back.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
Get out.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
Jeff yells.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:30.000
Oh, it's getting serious.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
It's getting really serious right now.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
Should I say...

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:40.000
By the way, Cody, Dan's girlfriend and I went to high school together.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:41.000
Oh, yeah, yeah.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:42.000
Yeah.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:43.000
All right.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:44.000
There's nine pages.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
I mean, I just need to before the show's over.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:47.000
Before what?

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:48.000
How many pages do you need?

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:49.000
Well, it needs to be an act.

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
I promised an act of the community movie.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
So, like, 15 pages?

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
I could probably do it, like, as people leave.

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
And then it'll be done.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:00.000
I think they get the idea that it's bad.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:01.000
Okay.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:02.000
I don't know.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
There's a Dr. Hooters.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:05.000
Okay.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:06.000
That was cool.

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:07.000
Let's meet some people.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
Who and don't, you know, like, we got...

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
You San Diego, you're awesome.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:12.000
You're from all over.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:13.000
By the way, I'm very curious.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:16.000
How many of you are just from San Diego?

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:19.000
And I don't mean just like that's not a good thing.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
I just mean you're just here locally.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:26.000
So, everyone else, just by a pleasure from somewhere else.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
It's much different from our last San Diego show

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
because we did a show at the...

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
Tin Roof.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:36.000
And it was the Sunday after Comic-Con was all over.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:39.000
And it was actually really prominent.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
It was like San Diego natives

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
because it was like the Comic-Con had closed down.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:47.000
But we've got real Comic-Con people, like pilgrimage.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
Who's from real far away show of hands?

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
Like, you think you're super far away?

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:54.000
Like, who's from out of country?

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
What's your country?

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
I bought tickets in South Korea that I moved to Italy

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
and I bought Harmontown tickets from Italy.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
You bought Harmontown tickets from Italy?

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
After moving from South Korea.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:05.000
Who came from farther than Italy?

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:06.000
Right there in the middle?

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:07.000
South Korea.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
I bought Comic-Con tickets in South Korea.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
But you moved to Italy that bought Harmontown tickets.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:12.000
Okay, South Korea.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:13.000
Can you beat South Korea?

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:14.000
The hands went down.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
Anybody beat South Korea?

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:17.000
Right there?

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:23.000
Ireland doesn't beat South Korea in anything.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
Here's what I'm really curious about.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:28.000
A lot of you came from far away.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:31.000
Who thinks that they have kind of a...

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
A knowledge of kimchi?

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
Here's what I'd like to do.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
I'm going to tell you in advance.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
You're intelligent people so you can help me out here.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
This is the format I want to go for.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:44.000
I want to bring up one person that has a dark side of Comic-Con story

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:47.000
and one person who has a light side of Comic-Con story.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:51.000
One person who has an anecdote that is like,

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
oh, this is what makes Comic-Con amazing.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
This is the only thing that can...

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:58.000
Or just something wonderful that happened to you that caused you joy.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:01.000
And then another person who has a nightmare story.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:02.000
And it's up to you.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
It doesn't matter how dark.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
So who's got a dark one?

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:07.000
You've got your hand up.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
So we're going to trust you.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:10.000
You've got a dark story.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:11.000
Do you want to come up and share it?

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:12.000
Okay.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:13.000
Can you hop up here?

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:14.000
Do you want to go through the stairs?

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:15.000
And then who thinks...

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:16.000
I think it's my kettle one.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:17.000
No, you drank my kettle one.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:18.000
You don't get any more.

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:21.000
The dark story is that he's a creature that is a slave to his habit.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:22.000
Joseph.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:23.000
What's on that?

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:24.000
Joseph.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:25.000
Have a seat, Joseph.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:26.000
We're here.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:27.000
We're here.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:28.000
Pick a chair.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:29.000
Welcome, Joseph.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:30.000
This is Joseph.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:31.000
Okay.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:32.000
And so who thinks they have a...

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:33.000
Who thinks they have a light...

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:36.000
A joyful, like this Comic-Con's great story?

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:37.000
It's not...

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:38.000
There's no hands going up.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:39.000
If there's...

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:40.000
There's one.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:41.000
I think I see one there.

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
There's one over there.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
Are your hands shooting up?

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:46.000
Yeah, I'm nodding at you.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:47.000
Yeah.

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:48.000
Okay.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:49.000
Okay.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:50.000
All right.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:51.000
Wait.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:52.000
No.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:53.000
Oh, I was...

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:54.000
There was a girl in the back.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:55.000
Or it looks like a girl.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:56.000
Yeah, I thought...

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:57.000
I'm sorry.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:58.000
Do we have a woman back there?

01:19:58.000 --> 01:19:59.000
She's back there.

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:00.000
Yeah.

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:01.000
Yeah, that was the hand.

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:02.000
We can't see...

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:03.000
Shot your name out or just start charging the stage.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:04.000
Are you all right?

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:05.000
No, I think...

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:06.000
No, I think...

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:07.000
Well, Levy...

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:08.000
Levy is...

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:09.000
All right, all right.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:10.000
You know, he...

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:11.000
Thanks, Joseph.

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:12.000
Follow him.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:13.000
This is special.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:14.500
Follow him and he's going to take you through the doors so you don't have to jump on stage

01:20:14.500 --> 01:20:19.500
wearing your skirt and give everybody the greatest show of their lives.

01:20:19.500 --> 01:20:20.500
How are they...

01:20:20.500 --> 01:20:22.500
The people that hate the show, how are you guys doing over there?

01:20:22.500 --> 01:20:23.500
Good?

01:20:23.500 --> 01:20:24.500
Okay.

01:20:24.500 --> 01:20:25.500
Oh, it's the Rick and Morty writers.

01:20:25.500 --> 01:20:26.500
Okay.

01:20:26.500 --> 01:20:27.500
Jesus Christ.

01:20:27.500 --> 01:20:28.500
As everybody...

01:20:28.500 --> 01:20:29.500
As you get...

01:20:29.500 --> 01:20:31.000
Like, I know the tickets are expensive.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:32.000
Are you all right?

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:33.000
I'll do whatever.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
How about the people real quick?

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
That was a smattering.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
People up in the balcony up there.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:40.000
Has anybody...

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:41.000
And I want you to be honest.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.440
Has anybody, like, gotten the first base?

01:20:43.440 --> 01:20:44.440
Like, any...

01:20:44.440 --> 01:20:45.440
Any grabbing up there?

01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:46.440
Any making out?

01:20:46.440 --> 01:20:47.440
Ah, boo.

01:20:47.440 --> 01:20:48.440
Does anybody...

01:20:48.440 --> 01:20:51.440
Does anybody feel unsafe with the person they're with tonight?

01:20:51.440 --> 01:20:52.440
Or just...

01:20:52.440 --> 01:20:55.440
Just his hands shooting up everywhere.

01:20:55.440 --> 01:20:56.440
Okay.

01:20:56.440 --> 01:20:57.440
We don't know what to do about that.

01:20:57.440 --> 01:20:58.440
I don't...

01:20:58.440 --> 01:20:59.440
Because we don't know...

01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:00.440
Okay.

01:21:00.440 --> 01:21:01.440
Call someone.

01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:02.440
Yes.

01:21:02.440 --> 01:21:03.440
Call someone that you feel safe with.

01:21:03.440 --> 01:21:04.440
I don't know.

01:21:04.440 --> 01:21:05.440
All right.

01:21:05.440 --> 01:21:06.440
So we got Joseph of the N.F.

01:21:06.440 --> 01:21:07.440
I'm sorry.

01:21:07.440 --> 01:21:08.440
I clicked that bottle.

01:21:08.440 --> 01:21:09.440
Joseph of the N.F.

01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:10.440
Where are you from?

01:21:10.440 --> 01:21:11.440
I'm from China Lake, California.

01:21:11.440 --> 01:21:12.440
China Lake?

01:21:12.440 --> 01:21:13.440
Sorry.

01:21:13.440 --> 01:21:14.440
Yeah.

01:21:14.440 --> 01:21:16.440
You stole my kettle and that's what happens.

01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:18.440
I asked if you were going to drink it.

01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:19.440
I know.

01:21:19.440 --> 01:21:20.440
I gave it to you.

01:21:20.440 --> 01:21:21.440
And you gave it to me.

01:21:21.440 --> 01:21:22.440
Where is China Lake, California?

01:21:22.440 --> 01:21:23.440
It's by a town called Ridgecrest.

01:21:23.440 --> 01:21:25.440
It's in the middle of Bumfuck, Middleware.

01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:26.440
Oh, Ridgecrest.

01:21:26.440 --> 01:21:27.440
Yeah.

01:21:27.440 --> 01:21:28.440
Have you heard of it?

01:21:28.440 --> 01:21:29.440
I knew a guy who moved to Ridgecrest.

01:21:29.440 --> 01:21:30.440
Never heard from him again.

01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:32.440
Who was it?

01:21:32.440 --> 01:21:33.440
Austin.

01:21:33.440 --> 01:21:34.440
Really?

01:21:34.440 --> 01:21:35.440
Yeah.

01:21:35.440 --> 01:21:36.440
You know Austin?

01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:37.440
I know him, Austin.

01:21:37.440 --> 01:21:38.440
Yeah.

01:21:38.440 --> 01:21:39.440
No, that's him.

01:21:39.440 --> 01:21:40.440
Oh.

01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:42.440
You're on the same tennis team together?

01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:43.440
Yeah.

01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:44.440
He was huge into tennis.

01:21:44.440 --> 01:21:45.440
Really?

01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:46.440
Yeah.

01:21:46.440 --> 01:21:47.440
Weird.

01:21:47.440 --> 01:21:48.440
Anyways, yeah.

01:21:48.440 --> 01:21:51.440
So, I've got two dark stories.

01:21:51.440 --> 01:21:55.440
So, I'm just going to say the one that involved me personally.

01:21:55.440 --> 01:21:56.440
So, okay.

01:21:56.440 --> 01:21:59.440
So, this was about two, three years ago.

01:21:59.440 --> 01:22:02.440
It was my fourth or fifth, not fourth or fifth time.

01:22:02.440 --> 01:22:04.440
Second time at Comic Con.

01:22:04.440 --> 01:22:06.440
I was there all four days.

01:22:06.440 --> 01:22:09.440
It was a Saturday and I hadn't eaten the whole day.

01:22:09.440 --> 01:22:14.440
And, you know, as we all do, we get hungry throughout the day.

01:22:14.440 --> 01:22:15.440
Hungry.

01:22:15.440 --> 01:22:16.440
Yes.

01:22:16.440 --> 01:22:17.440
Hungry.

01:22:17.440 --> 01:22:18.440
Yes.

01:22:18.440 --> 01:22:19.440
Thank you.

01:22:19.440 --> 01:22:21.440
I know exactly how that feels.

01:22:21.440 --> 01:22:22.440
Steven.

01:22:22.440 --> 01:22:23.440
I like it.

01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:24.440
You're not.

01:22:24.440 --> 01:22:25.440
I'm done with Steven.

01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:26.440
No.

01:22:26.440 --> 01:22:28.440
Steven, your guess at her name was Steven.

01:22:28.440 --> 01:22:30.440
There's two Spencers up here.

01:22:30.440 --> 01:22:32.440
It's really hard to mess up.

01:22:32.440 --> 01:22:33.440
There's Steven there.

01:22:33.440 --> 01:22:34.440
There's one here.

01:22:34.440 --> 01:22:36.440
You're taking your best guess at what her name might be.

01:22:36.440 --> 01:22:37.440
It's Steven.

01:22:37.440 --> 01:22:38.440
I was dragged here.

01:22:38.440 --> 01:22:40.440
I only know about Rick and Morty.

01:22:40.440 --> 01:22:41.440
I'm sorry, guys.

01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:42.440
You're not a victim, sir.

01:22:42.440 --> 01:22:43.440
You came up on stage.

01:22:43.440 --> 01:22:44.440
I did.

01:22:44.440 --> 01:22:48.440
We're not going to bully you, but you're not a victim.

01:22:48.440 --> 01:22:49.440
Dan, Dan.

01:22:49.440 --> 01:22:51.440
Look, I didn't ask for any of this.

01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:53.440
I'll wear the black hat.

01:22:53.440 --> 01:22:54.440
I may bully him.

01:22:54.440 --> 01:22:55.440
I may bully him.

01:22:55.440 --> 01:22:56.440
Okay.

01:22:56.440 --> 01:22:57.440
All right.

01:22:57.440 --> 01:22:58.440
So, tell us your dark time.

01:22:58.440 --> 01:22:59.440
Joseph, tell the goddamn story.

01:22:59.440 --> 01:23:00.440
I'm trying.

01:23:00.440 --> 01:23:01.440
It's funny that you guessed Steven.

01:23:01.440 --> 01:23:02.440
It's funny you guessed Steven.

01:23:02.440 --> 01:23:03.440
Okay.

01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:04.440
Anyways.

01:23:04.440 --> 01:23:05.440
It's not a girl's name.

01:23:05.440 --> 01:23:06.440
It's not a girl's name.

01:23:06.440 --> 01:23:08.440
It is not.

01:23:08.440 --> 01:23:15.440
I hadn't eaten the entire day and I finally paid like $40 for some chicken strips and a

01:23:15.440 --> 01:23:17.440
diet coke and some fries.

01:23:17.440 --> 01:23:18.440
Set in the scene.

01:23:18.440 --> 01:23:19.440
I am.

01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:23.440
And interior, San Diego Comic Con 2013.

01:23:23.440 --> 01:23:24.440
Sounds about right.

01:23:24.440 --> 01:23:27.440
It was diagnosed with cancer a year before.

01:23:27.440 --> 01:23:28.440
Okay.

01:23:28.440 --> 01:23:29.440
She got real.

01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:30.440
She got real.

01:23:30.440 --> 01:23:31.440
She did.

01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:32.440
What kind?

01:23:32.440 --> 01:23:33.440
What kind?

01:23:33.440 --> 01:23:34.440
No joke.

01:23:34.440 --> 01:23:36.440
What are you showing me a scar?

01:23:36.440 --> 01:23:37.440
What's going on?

01:23:37.440 --> 01:23:38.440
That's my scar.

01:23:38.440 --> 01:23:39.440
Okay.

01:23:39.440 --> 01:23:40.440
You win.

01:23:40.440 --> 01:23:41.440
You win.

01:23:41.440 --> 01:23:42.440
What the fuck?

01:23:42.440 --> 01:23:43.440
No.

01:23:43.440 --> 01:23:44.440
Calm down.

01:23:44.440 --> 01:23:45.440
He's representing the darkness.

01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:46.440
Okay.

01:23:46.440 --> 01:23:47.440
What kind of cancer?

01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:48.440
Eyelid cell.

01:23:48.440 --> 01:23:49.440
It's what Steve Jobs had.

01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:50.440
Eyelid cell.

01:23:50.440 --> 01:23:51.440
Correct.

01:23:51.440 --> 01:23:52.440
I don't even know.

01:23:52.440 --> 01:23:53.440
I've never heard that phrase.

01:23:53.440 --> 01:23:56.440
I thought Steve Jobs had like pancreatic.

01:23:56.440 --> 01:24:00.440
It affects the pancreas but it attaches to the adrenal glands.

01:24:00.440 --> 01:24:01.440
Eyelid cells?

01:24:01.440 --> 01:24:02.440
No.

01:24:02.440 --> 01:24:04.440
Eyelid.

01:24:04.440 --> 01:24:05.440
Eyelid.

01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:06.440
Eyelid.

01:24:06.440 --> 01:24:07.440
Eyelid.

01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:08.440
Yeah.

01:24:08.440 --> 01:24:11.440
But all my doctors are from different countries so I have no idea what they're saying half

01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:12.440
the time.

01:24:12.440 --> 01:24:13.440
This is terrifying.

01:24:13.440 --> 01:24:16.440
I was 18 at the time.

01:24:16.440 --> 01:24:17.440
I'm all good now.

01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:18.440
Well, relatively.

01:24:18.440 --> 01:24:19.440
I have to go back.

01:24:19.440 --> 01:24:20.440
It's life.

01:24:20.440 --> 01:24:21.440
You've got to get on.

01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:22.440
You've got to move forward.

01:24:22.440 --> 01:24:25.440
So this is a year after you've been diagnosed with this?

01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:26.440
Yeah.

01:24:26.440 --> 01:24:27.440
So I was pretty upset.

01:24:27.440 --> 01:24:31.440
I bought $40 worth of food and it was like three things.

01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:32.440
Which was one pretzel.

01:24:32.440 --> 01:24:33.440
Yeah.

01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:37.440
Which was one pretzel and they were like, hey, you want a water bottle?

01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:38.440
You've got to give me a hand job.

01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:40.440
And I'm like, what the fuck?

01:24:40.440 --> 01:24:46.440
Anyway, so there was a conga line of Deadpool cosplayers and I was like, you know what?

01:24:46.440 --> 01:24:52.440
I could wait the two minutes for them to all finish up for me to finally sit down and

01:24:52.440 --> 01:24:53.440
eat.

01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:58.440
And as I am like standing there, one of them looks at me.

01:24:58.440 --> 01:24:59.940
You'll be me for a minute.

01:24:59.940 --> 01:25:05.600
And they look at my plate and it'll be your mic hand and then they were like, smack it

01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:06.600
down.

01:25:06.600 --> 01:25:07.600
I know.

01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:08.760
It broke my heart.

01:25:08.760 --> 01:25:10.080
Your $40 meal.

01:25:10.080 --> 01:25:11.320
My $40 meal.

01:25:11.320 --> 01:25:14.920
So I just haul off and punched the motherfucker out.

01:25:14.920 --> 01:25:17.760
What is this dental curse?

01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:20.760
And I think this is the reason why I hate Deadpool.

01:25:20.760 --> 01:25:24.000
And I just like haul off just right hook.

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.040
And like I put all my energy behind it.

01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:27.040
And you're normally a puncher.

01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:28.840
Have you thrown punches in anger before?

01:25:28.840 --> 01:25:34.280
You know, I've only been in one fight and it was like, you're 6'4", I believe you

01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:35.280
said.

01:25:35.280 --> 01:25:39.280
Yeah, he was 6'4", and like, all the pounds.

01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:42.600
Wait, that's every pound.

01:25:42.600 --> 01:25:44.000
That is every pound.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:45.000
Every single pound.

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:46.120
The pounds you can have.

01:25:46.120 --> 01:25:49.080
He was like, hey, nerdy little white-ass motherfucker.

01:25:49.080 --> 01:25:51.280
Did you take him down?

01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:54.640
Well, no, I threw sand in his eyes, all the dales.

01:25:54.640 --> 01:25:56.120
Wait, there's sand at the con...

01:25:56.120 --> 01:25:57.120
Where were those nests?

01:25:57.120 --> 01:26:00.600
Well, this was at my old high school because we live in the desert.

01:26:00.600 --> 01:26:03.520
Wait, is this chicken nugget, Deadpool guy?

01:26:03.520 --> 01:26:04.520
Hold on.

01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:05.520
No, no, no, no.

01:26:05.520 --> 01:26:07.720
The first fight was all the pounds.

01:26:07.720 --> 01:26:09.480
Deadpool guy didn't weigh all the pounds.

01:26:09.480 --> 01:26:10.480
No, Deadpool guy was like...

01:26:10.480 --> 01:26:15.800
The first fight, you threw sand in his eyes, I kicked him in the shins, and I ran away.

01:26:15.800 --> 01:26:18.120
Okay, that's a good move.

01:26:18.120 --> 01:26:19.120
But Deadpool guy...

01:26:19.120 --> 01:26:20.120
That shit still works.

01:26:20.120 --> 01:26:21.120
Yeah, it does.

01:26:21.120 --> 01:26:22.120
Pocket sand.

01:26:22.120 --> 01:26:25.480
Anyways, Deadpool guy, like, I give a solid like...

01:26:25.480 --> 01:26:27.400
No title, pocket sand.

01:26:27.400 --> 01:26:32.000
Like solid right hook, and I lean into it, and I fall forward and shit, and then like

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:37.800
I finally realized what I did, and I was like, oh shit, I need to get out of here.

01:26:37.800 --> 01:26:40.480
Because you got an angry conga line on your hands now.

01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:41.480
I do.

01:26:41.480 --> 01:26:45.120
A conga line of guys whose gimmick is having two swords each.

01:26:45.120 --> 01:26:46.600
Yeah, and you know what?

01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:50.960
Like I realized what I did, and I was like, oh shit, I gotta get out of the convention.

01:26:50.960 --> 01:26:52.800
When you hit him, like, you hit him in the face?

01:26:52.800 --> 01:26:53.800
Oh yeah.

01:26:53.800 --> 01:26:54.800
And you knocked him down?

01:26:54.800 --> 01:26:55.800
Yeah.

01:26:55.800 --> 01:27:03.520
With all the like energy that I had in my body, like, I was like, pah, and like he hits the

01:27:03.520 --> 01:27:10.720
ground, and then I was there looking at my food for 10 seconds, and he's looking at me,

01:27:10.720 --> 01:27:13.320
or he's not looking at me, I don't know what the fuck he's looking at.

01:27:13.320 --> 01:27:14.320
Yeah, you don't know.

01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:15.320
He's got a mask on.

01:27:15.320 --> 01:27:16.320
Another part of his gimmick.

01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:17.320
Yeah.

01:27:17.320 --> 01:27:21.800
And then I was like, oh shit, like Comic-Con's the only thing I have.

01:27:21.800 --> 01:27:27.280
So I like immediately walk out, and then about two years before that, some guy got stabbed

01:27:27.280 --> 01:27:28.280
in the eye by a pencil.

01:27:28.280 --> 01:27:29.280
Right.

01:27:29.280 --> 01:27:30.280
We were talking about that earlier.

01:27:30.280 --> 01:27:31.280
Yeah, that was crazy shit.

01:27:31.280 --> 01:27:32.280
Wait.

01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:33.280
Was that you?

01:27:33.280 --> 01:27:34.280
You can't do that.

01:27:34.280 --> 01:27:35.280
Wait, wait, wait.

01:27:35.280 --> 01:27:36.280
Back to your story.

01:27:36.280 --> 01:27:37.280
We'll read the newspaper about the pencil thing.

01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:38.280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:27:38.280 --> 01:27:39.280
Anyways.

01:27:39.280 --> 01:27:40.280
What is it?

01:27:40.280 --> 01:27:45.520
You knocked a Deadpool the fuck out, and just walked out, because you said, Comic-Con's

01:27:45.520 --> 01:27:47.760
all I have, and you just walked out?

01:27:47.760 --> 01:27:50.040
Because Comic-Con was all I had, like.

01:27:50.040 --> 01:27:52.480
Now you can't come back, because here's a Deadpool killer.

01:27:52.480 --> 01:27:53.480
But you have come back.

01:27:53.480 --> 01:27:55.800
But you don't know what happened to the Deadpool guy.

01:27:55.800 --> 01:27:56.800
No.

01:27:56.800 --> 01:27:59.800
I mean, if you're out here, I apologize.

01:27:59.800 --> 01:28:00.800
No?

01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:01.800
Nope.

01:28:01.800 --> 01:28:02.800
Is the Deadpool that got punched?

01:28:02.800 --> 01:28:04.600
I think the odds of that are low.

01:28:04.600 --> 01:28:05.600
Possibly.

01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:09.920
It'd be amazing if he came up and was like, I fucking thought it would be very Deadpoolian

01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:14.200
of me to knock your sandwich out of your hand, and I'm so sorry that you got hit.

01:28:14.200 --> 01:28:17.760
But he has a tattoo of three chicken nuggets on his shoulder, and he's like, I've come

01:28:17.760 --> 01:28:18.760
to kill you.

01:28:18.760 --> 01:28:21.560
Like, he's got a tear drop on his arm.

01:28:21.560 --> 01:28:22.560
Okay, well, that's it.

01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:24.120
I mean, I really thank you for sharing that.

01:28:24.120 --> 01:28:26.960
That's a truly dark Comic-Con moment.

01:28:26.960 --> 01:28:27.960
Thank you.

01:28:27.960 --> 01:28:28.960
Joseph, everybody.

01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:29.960
Thank you.

01:28:29.960 --> 01:28:30.960
Joseph.

01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:31.960
Have a wonderful convention, everybody.

01:28:31.960 --> 01:28:32.960
Thank you, Joseph.

01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:36.040
That's interesting, because you have a mix of people walking around.

01:28:36.040 --> 01:28:37.800
You don't know their back story.

01:28:37.800 --> 01:28:42.240
Some people, when we come here to surrender to a bigger thing than ourselves, like being

01:28:42.240 --> 01:28:43.840
a nerd is about obsession.

01:28:43.840 --> 01:28:46.400
It's about acquiescence to mythology.

01:28:46.400 --> 01:28:47.760
People are dressed up as these things.

01:28:47.760 --> 01:28:54.800
And I remember one of my first Comic-Con memories was seeing, there were two friends.

01:28:54.800 --> 01:29:03.800
One was dressed as Jean-Luc Picard captain, and his friend was old-school Kirk captain.

01:29:03.800 --> 01:29:11.880
And the Kirk was having, he was on the floor, like he was having an episode.

01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:16.560
And the Jean-Luc Picard guy was like cradling him and going like, they weren't doing a bit.

01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:22.400
But they were just two old friends, and one of them was having an actual heart attack.

01:29:22.400 --> 01:29:23.400
Oh my God.

01:29:23.400 --> 01:29:24.400
Anyways.

01:29:24.400 --> 01:29:25.400
All right.

01:29:25.400 --> 01:29:26.400
So the light side of Comic-Con.

01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:27.400
Mine's really happy.

01:29:27.400 --> 01:29:28.400
What is your name?

01:29:28.400 --> 01:29:29.400
By design.

01:29:29.400 --> 01:29:30.400
My name's Lara.

01:29:30.400 --> 01:29:31.400
Hello, Lara.

01:29:31.400 --> 01:29:32.400
Hi.

01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:36.400
What's your, yeah, what's the other side?

01:29:36.400 --> 01:29:39.400
I'm happy now, because it's kind of a bridge of where I started.

01:29:39.400 --> 01:29:44.840
I started coming to Comic-Con eight years ago with my dad and my cousin and my uncles,

01:29:44.840 --> 01:29:47.240
and we're all really into the same stuff.

01:29:47.240 --> 01:29:51.800
And we'd park our car at the Marriott across the street, and we'd pack a cooler full of

01:29:51.800 --> 01:29:56.560
beer and sandwiches, and we'd all meet and drink in the parking lot.

01:29:56.560 --> 01:29:57.560
Oh my God.

01:29:57.560 --> 01:29:58.560
Look, what book I found.

01:29:58.560 --> 01:30:00.600
Well, I met this guy, and oh, and I found this signature.

01:30:00.600 --> 01:30:01.600
Oh my God.

01:30:01.600 --> 01:30:03.800
Well, I think I read his book, and it was so exciting.

01:30:03.800 --> 01:30:06.880
And it was kind of just this new universe that was opening up.

01:30:06.880 --> 01:30:11.800
And then I moved here to San Diego, partially because I liked it, because I visited for

01:30:11.800 --> 01:30:16.640
Comic-Con, and I struggled for a long time being unemployed.

01:30:16.640 --> 01:30:20.960
And then I got a job with the newspaper here, the San Diego Union Tribune.

01:30:20.960 --> 01:30:25.080
And now I don't have to read the schedule, because it gets emailed to me, and I get invited

01:30:25.080 --> 01:30:26.640
to these cool press things.

01:30:26.640 --> 01:30:29.520
And I interviewed Farrell Audio yesterday.

01:30:29.520 --> 01:30:32.520
Dan, you were supposed to be there, but you were double-booked.

01:30:32.520 --> 01:30:33.520
No, double-booked.

01:30:33.520 --> 01:30:34.520
That's the bummer.

01:30:34.520 --> 01:30:35.520
You're the same man.

01:30:35.520 --> 01:30:38.520
I was punching a guy that took my chicken nuggets.

01:30:38.520 --> 01:30:40.160
Took your fucking $40 sandwich.

01:30:40.160 --> 01:30:45.520
And it's just so exciting, because I've watched it grown, and then in reflection, I can stare

01:30:45.520 --> 01:30:49.600
at it and go, oh, and it's watched me grow, and it's just exciting.

01:30:49.600 --> 01:30:51.240
I feel at home at Comic-Con.

01:30:51.240 --> 01:30:52.240
It's like a mecca for you.

01:30:52.240 --> 01:30:55.760
You can't even get absorbed by it.

01:30:55.760 --> 01:30:56.760
That is it.

01:30:56.760 --> 01:30:57.760
That's good.

01:30:57.760 --> 01:31:04.320
So yeah, it's a goddess that gives with one hand and takes with the other, Comic-Con.

01:31:04.320 --> 01:31:05.800
I don't know what my point was.

01:31:05.800 --> 01:31:07.680
I just thought we could explore that.

01:31:07.680 --> 01:31:08.680
And we did.

01:31:08.680 --> 01:31:09.680
I think I did a good job.

01:31:09.680 --> 01:31:10.680
I think so.

01:31:10.680 --> 01:31:13.280
I think I did a good job with this podcast.

01:31:13.280 --> 01:31:14.280
No I didn't.

01:31:14.280 --> 01:31:16.920
I need to make sure that their money was well spent.

01:31:16.920 --> 01:31:19.920
Hey, I'm right over here.

01:31:19.920 --> 01:31:22.560
It was well spent.

01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:24.760
And you were going to die at one point.

01:31:24.760 --> 01:31:27.840
Oh, well, you know, I got to go back next month.

01:31:27.840 --> 01:31:28.840
It's up in the air.

01:31:28.840 --> 01:31:29.840
Come give me a hug.

01:31:29.840 --> 01:31:30.840
Aww.

01:31:30.840 --> 01:31:31.840
Aww.

01:31:31.840 --> 01:31:48.360
I had the time of my life and I never felt this way before and I swear it's the truth.

01:31:48.360 --> 01:31:49.360
Do the lift.

01:31:49.360 --> 01:31:50.360
Do the lift.

01:31:50.360 --> 01:31:51.360
You got to do the lift.

01:31:51.360 --> 01:31:52.360
Uh oh.

01:31:52.360 --> 01:31:53.360
Oh god.

01:31:53.360 --> 01:31:54.360
Oh no.

01:31:54.360 --> 01:31:55.360
Oh no.

01:31:55.360 --> 01:31:56.360
Don't do the lift.

01:31:56.360 --> 01:32:04.880
Wait, I think if Laura and Joseph get together, maybe we can do the lift.

01:32:04.880 --> 01:32:08.360
Laura, can you and Joseph team up and do the Dan Harmon line?

01:32:08.360 --> 01:32:09.680
We had two Jennifer Greys.

01:32:09.680 --> 01:32:10.680
That was the problem.

01:32:10.680 --> 01:32:11.680
Yeah, exactly.

01:32:11.680 --> 01:32:12.680
There wasn't a Swayze among us.

01:32:12.680 --> 01:32:13.680
Oh, you guys are good.

01:32:13.680 --> 01:32:14.680
Okay.

01:32:14.680 --> 01:32:15.680
Oh my god.

01:32:15.680 --> 01:32:16.680
This will work.

01:32:16.680 --> 01:32:17.680
This seems super dangerous, guys.

01:32:17.680 --> 01:32:18.680
This is going to be worse.

01:32:18.680 --> 01:32:19.680
Don't hurt yourself.

01:32:19.680 --> 01:32:20.680
I had the time of my life.

01:32:20.680 --> 01:32:27.680
From the legs, Laura.

01:32:27.680 --> 01:32:28.680
From the legs.

01:32:28.680 --> 01:32:29.680
Oh no.

01:32:29.680 --> 01:32:30.680
Oh dear god.

01:32:30.680 --> 01:32:31.680
It was great.

01:32:31.680 --> 01:32:32.680
It was amazing.

01:32:32.680 --> 01:32:33.680
We tried.

01:32:33.680 --> 01:32:34.680
You guys win.

01:32:34.680 --> 01:32:35.680
You won.

01:32:35.680 --> 01:32:36.680
Yeah, it's comic kind of.

01:32:36.680 --> 01:32:37.680
I got to first base.

01:32:37.680 --> 01:32:40.680
I got really nervous because I heard Spencer going, don't hurt yourself.

01:32:40.680 --> 01:32:41.680
He was like, did I get nervous?

01:32:41.680 --> 01:32:42.680
I was feeling sorry.

01:32:42.680 --> 01:32:43.680
I'm really sorry.

01:32:43.680 --> 01:32:44.680
We got to first base.

01:32:44.680 --> 01:32:45.680
Call me after.

01:32:45.680 --> 01:32:52.680
Wow.

01:32:52.680 --> 01:32:54.680
He's dating someone.

01:32:54.680 --> 01:32:55.680
Who?

01:32:55.680 --> 01:32:56.680
Dan?

01:32:56.680 --> 01:32:57.680
Yes.

01:32:57.680 --> 01:32:58.680
We're dating someone.

01:32:58.680 --> 01:33:01.680
He's dating a hive mind apparently.

01:33:01.680 --> 01:33:02.680
Jeez.

01:33:02.680 --> 01:33:06.680

01:33:06.680 --> 01:33:07.680

01:33:07.680 --> 01:33:13.680
You're like the phantom of the comic kind of just come up here to fondle the people on

01:33:13.680 --> 01:33:14.680

01:33:21.680 --> 01:33:24.680

01:33:24.680 --> 01:33:25.680

01:33:25.680 --> 01:33:26.680

01:33:30.680 --> 01:33:32.680
Am I still staying up here?

01:33:32.680 --> 01:33:33.680
What's going on?

01:33:33.680 --> 01:33:35.680
I feel like we should leave.

01:33:35.680 --> 01:33:36.680
I mean.

01:33:36.680 --> 01:33:37.680
You feel this is so bad.

01:33:37.680 --> 01:33:38.680

01:33:40.680 --> 01:33:41.680
Wait.

01:33:41.680 --> 01:33:43.680
Do I have to match you on the clothes that we take off?

01:33:43.680 --> 01:33:44.680
No.

01:33:44.680 --> 01:33:45.680
I'll do it.

01:33:45.680 --> 01:33:46.680

I guess I just don't say your ticket wasn't worth it.

01:33:59.680 --> 01:34:03.680
I don't want you to think, oh, I should have gone to the, the Buffy panel or something.

01:34:03.680 --> 01:34:04.680
I don't.

01:34:04.680 --> 01:34:05.680
Actually, you shouldn't have.

01:34:05.680 --> 01:34:06.680
You should have come here.

01:34:06.680 --> 01:34:11.680

When you go to Comic Con, you've got to go all along.

01:34:58.680 --> 01:35:05.680
The aisles that are long, you've got to go between the people that are buying things.

01:35:05.680 --> 01:35:09.680
Fuck your mama so hard, she put her arm in a sling.

01:35:09.680 --> 01:35:17.680

Kiss my dick, it's only so long, and she's gotta get longer to make it last long.

01:35:43.680 --> 01:35:46.680
It doesn't make any sense.

01:35:46.680 --> 01:35:48.680
