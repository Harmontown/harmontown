{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:12.680\nFrom the Malboa Theater in San Diego, coming down 2015,\n\n00:12.680 --> 00:33.000\nHarmontown is now in second, but brings better criticism out to the stage.\n\n00:33.000 --> 00:48.280\nHello, Comic-Con! Hello, San Diego! Thank you so much! God, I've been hydrating for you all day.\n\n00:48.280 --> 00:54.760\nI got so drunk yesterday and I made up my mind. We're not doing a bad show for San Diego. Thank\n\n00:54.760 --> 01:00.480\nyou guys for coming out. We're in competition with Star Wars, Star Trek, Muppet movies,\n\n01:00.480 --> 01:06.860\nwhatever. Every major corporation that has anything to sell is selling it tonight at Nerd\n\n01:06.860 --> 01:13.240\nDance, NerdCan. This is the pop cultural epicenter of the year and of the country and these are the,\n\n01:13.240 --> 01:23.840\nit looks like, 500 people or so that really loved us above all else. And we owe them an amazing show.\n\n01:23.840 --> 01:31.680\nI will not leave this stage until each of you feels like you've got $30 worth of entertainment\n\n01:31.680 --> 01:37.000\nand that's not fucking around. I'm going to do whatever I have to do for you,\n\n01:37.000 --> 01:42.760\nbut that also means I have to guard and protect you against abuses of your time.\n\n01:42.760 --> 01:51.200\nBut Dan, we have nothing for sale here except entertainment. They didn't buy that at all.\n\n01:51.200 --> 01:56.080\nSo we all just came from the same yacht. I think that's the most important thing.\n\n01:56.080 --> 01:59.920\nLet's talk about the yachts. Actually, you know what? We can wait for that until our guest comes\n\n01:59.920 --> 02:03.680\nout because I don't want her to have to wait too long. I'll talk about things that our guest\n\n02:03.680 --> 02:09.240\nwasn't there for, like the fact that I got my testicles checked because I felt like I felt\n\n02:09.240 --> 02:15.440\nlike a small something and I was like, whatever, it's like in the tissues, but not the yacht.\n\n02:15.440 --> 02:23.280\nWas it right above your balls? No, that's my penis. I felt something under the underside,\n\n02:23.280 --> 02:28.800\nbut I was like, I don't know. It's like life is going too good. I'm very happy and very much\n\n02:28.800 --> 02:33.040\nin love and I'm working on things that I love and so of course I had to feel around until I found\n\n02:33.040 --> 02:43.200\nsomething. It made me think like I got to go to the doctor. So I went to the doctor and my doctor\n\n02:43.200 --> 02:50.640\nis like a bro. He makes jokes. He does bits. So then when he's like, so what's going on? I was\n\n02:50.640 --> 02:54.880\nlike, I think maybe a lump and he's like, in your butt? In your balls? Sorry, I didn't say in your\n\n02:54.880 --> 03:03.360\nbutt. You guys are making me nervous. He's like, in your balls and then he felt the balls and so\n\n03:03.360 --> 03:09.680\nhe's feeling my balls. He's like a guy. He's like a Scrubs character. He's just like a Zach\n\n03:09.680 --> 03:15.280\ngraphy and kind of like, he's just a bro. And so he's feeling my balls, but I really, I felt, I\n\n03:15.280 --> 03:22.720\ndidn't really, I touched my nipple. I reached up and I was like, I caught myself. He was just\n\n03:22.720 --> 03:29.840\nfeeling my balls around and I went, I reached up and I touched my nipple because as a reflex.\n\n03:29.840 --> 03:34.240\nI don't know. And Cody had told me before, she said like, you touched your nipple when,\n\n03:34.240 --> 03:44.000\nwhat? God damn it. Now I forgot. Oh, okay. Okay. So that's it. Yeah. Why is she off stage for that\n\n03:44.000 --> 03:50.320\nline? Because she's not check off. She should be on stage for the action. That's I leave that up\n\n03:50.320 --> 03:54.480\nto her. I don't want to play. She's not a performer. She doesn't like the spotlight unless it's\n\n03:54.480 --> 03:58.080\nunconditional. But she wants to hold your dick while you pee. Well, yeah, but she wanted to remind\n\n03:58.080 --> 04:01.600\nme the story. We were in a hotel and she's like, I want to hold your dick when you pee. A lot of\n\n04:01.600 --> 04:04.960\npeople will testify to this. This is the kind of stuff that's not politically correct, but it's\n\n04:04.960 --> 04:10.000\nlike, like, it's something that people do. It sounds romantic as hell. Can I aim your wiener\n\n04:10.000 --> 04:15.920\nwhile you pee? And she told me that I was touching my nipple while she was doing it. I was like,\n\n04:15.920 --> 04:19.120\nno, I wasn't. Because there's nothing really sexual about it. It was just a favor for a friend.\n\n04:19.120 --> 04:23.920\nLike, there you go. That's like coming to the firehouse and you go like, don't play with matches\n\n04:23.920 --> 04:30.400\nand okay, here's what a hose is like. She said, you touched your nipple. I was like, no, I didn't\n\n04:30.400 --> 04:34.800\nbecause I was like, but then the doctor was like checking my testicles and I was like playing\n\n04:34.800 --> 04:41.040\nwith my nipple. Right. And then I went, so what I'm saying is we're all the same.\n\n04:43.840 --> 04:46.320\nI think what you're saying is we're all a little different.\n\n04:49.280 --> 04:54.400\nNo, we're all the same. Now it's always the same nipple when she was holding your wiener and he\n\n04:54.400 --> 04:58.640\nwas checking your balls. Is it left hand to left nipple? I don't know. I mean, I don't know what\n\n04:58.640 --> 05:02.400\nI did when she was helping me. But I remember this because I remember the sensation of me going\n\n05:02.400 --> 05:06.560\nlike, what am I doing? Because I was like, I was like shifting around for him. I was like,\n\n05:06.560 --> 05:11.280\non the bottom side. And then I was like, neat. Do you think it's a more of a comfort thing\n\n05:11.280 --> 05:15.680\nthan a sexual thing? Or is it, are those two things related? Well, I think that things that\n\n05:15.680 --> 05:19.920\ngive you comfort is anything that gives you comfort is a potential addiction and addiction is like\n\n05:19.920 --> 05:24.320\nyour neurology growing around something. So as my therapist says, if you have your first drink\n\n05:24.320 --> 05:28.560\nwhen you're 12 years old, like the experience you have is, oh my God, I had a cup of this stuff and\n\n05:28.560 --> 05:33.200\nit had, I had a great night. So it's not the same when you do it when you're 16. And it's not the\n\n05:33.200 --> 05:37.760\nsame when you do it when you're 32 because your neurology like develops a relationship around\n\n05:37.760 --> 05:43.680\nthe process. So you have no idea at any given time, if you think you're doing what you want to do,\n\n05:43.680 --> 05:48.400\nit might be something that your brain thinks you want to do because wanting to want to do it\n\n05:48.400 --> 05:54.640\nmakes you want to feel, want to, want to, want to. Like it does it, it might just be garbage. And\n\n05:54.640 --> 06:00.160\nthen you have to combine that with, gee, I wonder if we're vulnerable to an oligarchy hypnotizing\n\n06:00.160 --> 06:06.000\nus on a mass scale and doctorinating our values to a left and right margin. Do you think Dr.\n\n06:06.000 --> 06:15.040\nBraff, your doctor, do you think somebody whose job is to put fingers in that many butts and touch\n\n06:15.040 --> 06:19.680\nthat many balls for lumps and for serious reasons, sees a certain range of behavior,\n\n06:19.680 --> 06:24.240\nlike a lot of nipple touching or a lot of, I don't know, man, like, like neck scratching or,\n\n06:24.240 --> 06:28.640\nhe seems like the kind of guy that would definitely, if he had seen, if he thought there was a joke to\n\n06:28.640 --> 06:33.920\nbe had, he would have made it. Like this is a guy like, he does bits. He's like a funny Beverly\n\n06:33.920 --> 06:41.280\nHills doctor. He's a bro. He's a bro. Don't we go to the same doctor? No, same office. Same\n\n06:41.280 --> 06:46.560\noffice, but you get some classic. Yeah, my guy thinks he's funny, but he's really not funny.\n\n06:46.560 --> 06:51.360\nThat's every doctor. Like, I'm sorry if you're a doctor, like, you think you're funny, but\n\n06:51.360 --> 07:00.080\npeople are terrified. They're chuckling nervously. Like, they're like, like, it's weird. If you're\n\n07:00.080 --> 07:05.520\na doctor and you think you're funny, you need to think again, because you work all day with people\n\n07:05.520 --> 07:11.280\nwho have been, like, basically waterboarded. I haven't had a full, like, medical, like, blood test,\n\n07:11.280 --> 07:15.280\nthe whole thing. I said, give me the works. I want to know if I'm dying, living forever. Like, I want\n\n07:15.280 --> 07:19.440\nto know everything about me. And he gave me the whole stuff and he called me up and he was like,\n\n07:19.440 --> 07:23.600\nokay, this is good. This is great. He goes, your liver kidneys are fine. I'm like, what? I couldn't\n\n07:23.600 --> 07:28.080\nbelieve that, by the way. I never can. He keeps telling me my liver's great. I'm like, if you say\n\n07:28.080 --> 07:36.240\nso. Maybe his liver scanner is off or maybe the thumpet. But he goes, you, I don't know,\n\n07:36.240 --> 07:41.120\nis this one thing that's kind of an anomaly, Jeff, you're just a little bit of, like, density in\n\n07:41.120 --> 07:44.960\nyour red blood cells. Maybe you need to get a little more folic acid, B vitamins in your diet.\n\n07:44.960 --> 07:51.680\nI said, well, I am vegetarian. And he goes, I thought you were a Libra. And I paused. I paused\n\n07:51.680 --> 07:58.800\non the phone for as long as I could. Like, I think eight seconds. And I said, I'm sorry, I was just\n\n07:58.800 --> 08:06.000\nputting that on your chart. So that's the thing. Okay. I want to, by the way, Spencer, how are\n\n08:06.000 --> 08:16.800\nyou? Oh, I'm great. Yeah. No. It's, it's, uh, yeah, this is great. I just sit here and I get\n\n08:16.800 --> 08:23.200\napplause. It's amazing. I was kicking up the street, walking up the road from down by the, the, uh,\n\n08:23.200 --> 08:27.840\nthe marina up to the theater here at the Balboa. And I just walked by Spencer and he's like,\n\n08:27.840 --> 08:32.320\nHey, man, how's it going? Something made so much sense about just walking by Spencer at\n\n08:32.320 --> 08:36.880\nComic Con. And it felt so good. Well, yes and no, because Spencer doesn't dig crowds and like\n\n08:36.880 --> 08:42.400\npeople. So this is simultaneously, this is definitely, this is the place where you'd be most\n\n08:42.400 --> 08:50.160\nlike regarded and simultaneously probably most possibly unhappy. Oh yeah. Both of those things.\n\n08:51.520 --> 08:56.480\nNo, it's great. People, people say hi. They're just like, Oh, Spencer. And I'm like, Oh, you.\n\n08:56.480 --> 09:02.160\nExcept, except you fucking bolted back to that yacht when those Game of Thrones people showed up.\n\n09:02.160 --> 09:08.160\nOh, no, I was on a very specific and private Aaron. It was great. Getting, getting weed. Oh,\n\n09:08.160 --> 09:15.840\nno. That was the public part of the air. Dan yacht spoilers. Yeah. Come on. No, no,\n\n09:15.840 --> 09:21.360\nno, I was typing about it that we came from, but why don't we bring out our guest? She plays\n\n09:21.360 --> 09:46.720\nSummer on Rick and Morty Spencer Crittenden here. I think. Yeah. Hello, Spencer. Hello. Oh, God.\n\n09:46.720 --> 09:51.840\nWe have, we have a, we have a surfer to Spencer's up here. We're being surfered. Yeah. I didn't\n\n09:51.840 --> 09:56.240\nrealize that they were talking about you. Yeah. Sorry. They kept saying Spencer on the way over\n\n09:56.240 --> 10:00.560\nand it's like that at the office. They're like, Oh, Spencer's coming. And I'm like, I haven't\n\n10:00.560 --> 10:06.320\nheard about this at all. Spencer has to record and Spencer to this. Yeah. Can I,\n\n10:06.320 --> 10:15.600\nshould I go by Carl tonight? I'll be Carl. Okay. It'll work. It's a good name. No, no,\n\n10:15.600 --> 10:21.120\nit's not. I don't know. That's, I think it's a worse name. Sorry. Carl's the worst name.\n\n10:21.120 --> 10:27.120\nThere's probably Carl's out there. I hope so. Give a middle name, Spencer. Oh, yeah. What?\n\n10:27.680 --> 10:37.600\nKaren. Carl. Both of our middle names start with the sound. Yeah. Oh, my middle name is not\n\n10:37.600 --> 10:44.000\nactually Carl. I just, it's worse than Carl, which I've called a terrible name. So I'll lose if I\n\n10:44.000 --> 10:50.240\nreveal it. What's your middle name? We can all look it up. Yeah. No, look it up. You and I\n\n10:50.240 --> 10:57.040\nam DB. I am to be proud. I'm going to the script templates on Final Draft. Did you write a script\n\n10:57.040 --> 11:04.800\nfor me? Where the fuck is the community in Rick and Morty? Open from, come on. Come on. What's\n\n11:04.800 --> 11:11.520\nyour middle, what's your, what's your middle name? Spencer. Mine? Yeah. Karen. Karen. Yeah.\n\n11:11.520 --> 11:16.560\nKay. With a K. Yeah. Spencer. I don't know how. See what spell it? C.\n\n11:20.560 --> 11:29.440\nQ. C-H. Koran. It's a different Joe. I'm sorry, you guys. I'm not even, what are you doing?\n\n11:29.440 --> 11:34.080\nWhat are you doing? I'm sorry. There's a podcast. We're literally just, I'm opening up old drafts\n\n11:34.080 --> 11:37.600\nof scripts. What's going on? It's like looking through, this is Steve Levy's laptop, so I won't\n\n11:37.600 --> 11:42.560\ndig too hard. Let's go through, let's go through Steve Levy's shit right now. Let's even have an\n\n11:42.560 --> 11:51.360\nopportunity. Let's see his photos. Oh shit. Find some, all right. Those are like nice people.\n\n11:51.360 --> 12:01.840\nThat was his fraternity. Sigma Pi. Aw. Okay. Behind the scenes. Aw. He's so cute. Look at him.\n\n12:01.840 --> 12:10.000\nThat was his first girlfriend. Oh my God. Or his mother. Find a folder. Oh, was that me? Go back.\n\n12:11.680 --> 12:20.320\nI'm hungab like un-gab. All right. Wait, check out those emojis. That might tell us something.\n\n12:20.320 --> 12:25.920\nOkay, we got black. Look at these recently used emojis. The black Dan is a popular one. I gotta\n\n12:25.920 --> 12:32.080\nsay. What's a photo? I know it's a photo, Dan. Well, what do you want to go to those emojis?\n\n12:32.080 --> 12:37.840\nThey're already there. These are the recently used emojis. They tell you his story. No one's\n\n12:37.840 --> 12:43.120\nasking you to click on it. We're looking to glean information about Steve Levy. Why is the snowman\n\n12:43.120 --> 12:50.080\nthe first one? That's what I want to know. What kind of monster? This one. This one. Shy monkey,\n\n12:50.080 --> 12:56.720\nI know about. The Shy Monkey, Steve Levy, like any number of Shy Monkeys. Yeah, see no evil monkey.\n\n12:57.440 --> 13:03.520\nHe does that every time. Cody and I, for instance, we have a thing where every time you talk about\n\n13:03.520 --> 13:11.600\nwhen he's on your dick to pee. We'll try to trick Steve Levy. We'll go, hey, does the PR department\n\n13:11.600 --> 13:18.240\nhave one photo or something? Can I send you one? And then we'll send him a photo that Cody took\n\n13:18.240 --> 13:24.880\nof me laying on a hotel bed with my balls hanging out of my underwears. And he keeps, and then\n\n13:24.880 --> 13:31.360\nthere's all the Shy Monkey responses. But also, can we talk about your balls in that photo, Dan,\n\n13:31.360 --> 13:37.120\nbecause your balls look spectacular in that photo. They're almost admitting their own light.\n\n13:40.080 --> 13:44.480\nThis is amazing. His photo roll, he's such a company man. Yeah, really. There's gotta be one\n\n13:44.480 --> 13:50.640\nweird dick pic in here, some horrible thing. There's gonna be one, yeah, it's gonna be like this.\n\n13:50.640 --> 14:02.240\nThere we go. Oh, so cute. Marlon Brando. Tindermuch. Stanley. Oh, that's a real monkey. What is\n\n14:02.240 --> 14:08.560\nthat? That's a dick pic. That's a weird dick pic. Oh, that is. His dick looks like weird turkey\n\n14:08.560 --> 14:14.880\njerky. Oh, this is something we can analyze. Somebody's gonna crush him. That's his sister,\n\n14:14.880 --> 14:24.000\nright? Okay. Oh, I have a crush. Okay, all right. He loves his family. Okay, we've been in that\n\n14:24.000 --> 14:29.760\ntoo. This is so unethical. You know what, this could blow back on me. Yeah, no shit. I hear\n\n14:29.760 --> 14:34.240\nI'm thinking, like, let's go through his underwear. Like, dude, like, you know, you're gonna find your\n\n14:34.240 --> 14:38.640\nbag of cocaine in his underwear. Like, yeah, he's like, he's sitting back there going, I don't,\n\n14:38.640 --> 14:43.360\nyeah, keep going, motherfucker. It's just gonna be a receipt for your shot therapy. That's what the\n\n14:43.360 --> 14:51.120\nsnowman means. It's a cocaine snowman. Why is number one emoji on this thing snowman? That\n\n14:51.120 --> 14:58.320\nmeans he's clearly a dealer. Right, yeah, is it snowing in LA? Or is it snowing in San Diego?\n\n14:58.320 --> 15:02.480\nMaybe he moonlights as one of Santa's elves. Steve, do you want to come out and defend yourself?\n\n15:02.480 --> 15:06.080\nPossibility. Steve, Steve Levy, everybody, just bring him out, Steve Levy.\n\n15:11.520 --> 15:16.800\nOh, man. Let's talk about that snowman first. What's the deal? And then I want to talk about\n\n15:16.800 --> 15:26.160\nhow many black Santas he used. What? It's true. Don't look it up. I didn't hear her. Yeah, it's\n\n15:26.160 --> 15:33.920\ntrue. What's the question? Snowman. Spill. I use that for, like, hugs.\n\n15:39.840 --> 15:45.840\nBecause it's like a snowman. He's got his arms out. Right. And he's made of ice. And you hug him\n\n15:45.840 --> 15:54.080\nand he'll melt and die. And he's not of woman born. He's a fucking robot. And you're...\n\n15:54.080 --> 16:00.240\nThe children say he could dance and play just as much as you and me.\n\n16:01.840 --> 16:05.040\nAll right. Well, what do you guys want the community movie to be about? Because I got to\n\n16:05.040 --> 16:14.160\nstart writing a page. So Troy, he's on a pirate ship that he's taken over because he was a captive\n\n16:14.160 --> 16:18.320\noff-screen. Every once in a while, I'm going to write a page a minute. So, does anybody have a\n\n16:18.320 --> 16:26.560\ntimer? Yeah, yeah. Oh, this is what Steve's crate at. Logistics. He's like, I have a timer. Oh,\n\n16:26.560 --> 16:30.480\nthis is a terrible, wait, this is a terrible template. I don't know why. This is how I met your\n\n16:30.480 --> 16:39.440\nmother. I need to speak here. Don't go to open recent because that's revealing some secret\n\n16:39.440 --> 16:46.000\nproject we're working on. Dan, I want to take, like, six strips of paper and I want to hand\n\n16:46.000 --> 16:49.360\nthese out to people. I just want lines of dialogue that somebody might say in this. I\n\n16:49.360 --> 16:55.200\njust want a neutral line of dialogue. Maybe Dan will use it. I think ask them who has a pen\n\n16:55.200 --> 17:03.680\nfirst. Yeah, don't let them take any pens from us. We'll need those for later. And you ready?\n\n17:04.800 --> 17:10.320\nWell, let me... I want to do an act thing.

Also, what podcast is writing with the worst\n\n18:00.800 --> 18:09.760\none you set it to? It's an odd choice. Podcast Gold. Sorry, I need to shrink it a little bit.\n\n18:09.760 --> 18:18.640\nOh, geez. You're doing it. Okay. Oh, yes. At his map, or his leisure map.\n\n18:20.560 --> 18:23.920\nI want leisure map to be a real thing. It's like a treasure map, but for leisure.\n\n18:23.920 --> 18:32.000\nX marks the bed. He has a red macaw.\n\n18:34.800 --> 18:39.200\nWell, it's dotted also. Oh, very... Yeah, you should know that they're trying to go somewhere.\n\n18:40.160 --> 18:43.840\nYeah.

It's a give and take situation right now.\n\n18:48.400 --> 18:58.240\nGhost writing. This is what real writing is, you guys. Treasure! Treasure, I'm holding it.\n\n18:58.240 --> 19:05.120\nOf course. This is my best red macaw impression. Someone needs to enter now. Yeah, there we go.\n\n19:07.040 --> 19:13.040\nA girl? Can it be... Oh, male. Okay, damn it. Can we make him peg legs?\n\n19:13.040 --> 19:18.880\nAnd that's a minute. We did it. That's a minute. Damn it.\n\n19:20.960 --> 19:27.200\nAnd a powered male. Finally, a white powered male. Okay, all right. Unsettled.\n\n19:27.200 --> 19:28.960\nHow I met your mother three is the perfect title.\n\n19:30.800 --> 19:34.480\nWell, let's put that on the desktop next to Jordan Levy resume. Okay.\n\n19:34.480 --> 19:42.960\nWait, heck am I? Unsettled. How am I... Man, I should not have used my mother three.\n\n19:42.960 --> 19:45.280\nBetter mine than dance. Yeah, that would be nice.\n\n19:45.280 --> 19:50.080\nAll right, let's talk about dogs, racism, comic-con, sexual harassment.\n\n19:50.080 --> 19:53.120\nWhat about the boat party? Let's talk about this yacht party.\n\n19:53.120 --> 19:57.680\nAre we done? Is that all we're doing now? Okay, Levy, didn't you get a tarot card reading?\n\n19:59.200 --> 20:01.440\nShe was a hack. Did Cody tell you what she said?\n\n20:01.440 --> 20:04.480\nI was there. Yeah, well, she texted me to ask you about it.\n\n20:06.880 --> 20:14.560\nHe's going to find love. So Cody... No, it was James and his wife,\n\n20:14.560 --> 20:19.520\nRoxy, they were like, oh, man, tarot cards. You guys, you should get your tarot read.\n\n20:19.520 --> 20:22.320\nAnd then I was like, I don't know. That sounds kind of strange.\n\n20:22.320 --> 20:24.880\nAnd that's not for me. This is how everyone gets their tarot card just read.\n\n20:24.880 --> 20:29.280\nYeah. Well, okay, so Cody comes and she's like, you're doing it. And she sits me down and this lady,\n\n20:29.280 --> 20:34.640\nshe's like, asked me questions. Well, she asked me to shuffle the deck. I shuffled the deck.\n\n20:34.640 --> 20:37.440\nShe's like, what do you want to know? What's a question you want answered?\n\n20:38.720 --> 20:45.200\nAnd I said, I don't know, something about balance. How do I get balance in my life?\n\n20:45.200 --> 20:47.280\nSure. Typical question. Yeah.\n\n20:49.840 --> 20:56.720\nAnd Cody's like, no, that's a bad question. Say, like, ask about your love life. And I was like,\n\n20:56.720 --> 21:01.520\nall right, let's do something about my love life. Ask them about something they've rehearsed answering.\n\n21:03.280 --> 21:09.360\nThey're like, I don't know. Snickers. Come on, ask me, what are the three things you're supposed\n\n21:09.360 --> 21:13.920\nto ask so I can do my cold reading technique? So she goes, okay, so you want to figure out\n\n21:13.920 --> 21:17.280\nhow to balance your work life with love life and all this other stuff? And I was like, yeah,\n\n21:17.280 --> 21:22.240\nsure, that's great. All right, shuffle the deck, put the cards out on the table. And then she's\n\n21:22.240 --> 21:29.600\nlike, okay, pick five cards. And I picked five cards. And she put them in this weird cross.\n\n21:31.520 --> 21:35.440\nAnd she went, whoa, you got some weird cards. This is weird.\n\n21:36.720 --> 21:43.760\nAnd she gave you your money back. That'll be $85. Sorry, I can't help you. Weird cards.\n\n21:44.640 --> 21:48.960\nIt's like when you take a Honda to the mechanic. And then she was like,\n\n21:48.960 --> 21:53.600\nshe gives you like a one sentence readout, like a broad like, okay, here's the deal.\n\n21:53.600 --> 21:56.800\nAnd I don't really remember what she said. It was one of something along the lines of like,\n\n21:59.440 --> 22:00.240\nno, continue.\n\n22:02.720 --> 22:06.960\nI bet she, yeah, it sounds like she was like, oh, this is weird.\n\n22:06.960 --> 22:10.960\nOkay, so what did she say, Levy? She said you were going to meet a girl from a crowd of\n\n22:10.960 --> 22:17.600\nno, she said, she said, you need to focus on work right now. Work is your life. You got to keep\n\n22:17.600 --> 22:23.760\nworking really hard because work is your love life. Because now it's not the time for anything\n\n22:23.760 --> 22:31.360\nelse in your life. Except for work. I agree. And she said, no, I slipped her a hundred\n\n22:31.360 --> 22:37.120\nbefore. Just tell him work is his future. Cody, Cody looked at me and she went, oh,\n\n22:37.120 --> 22:42.800\nthis woman's a hack and then stopped listening instantly. Yeah. And then I was like, okay,\n\n22:42.800 --> 22:46.320\nexplain to me these cards. And she was like, okay, look, you got these like pentacles,\n\n22:46.320 --> 22:52.080\nwhich are coins and, and then you have a lot of swords. She was like, there are a lot of\n\n22:52.080 --> 22:57.440\nswords. She was like, you got some really rare cards in here. Let me show you how they all\n\n22:57.440 --> 23:05.440\nlink together. And how are there rare cards that she uses all the time? I didn't put this\n\n23:05.440 --> 23:11.840\nJoker in here. It's like cards less chosen, I guess. Or like, whatever. It's heck. Well,\n\n23:11.840 --> 23:17.600\nno, but what did she say? So, okay, so she said, okay, she said that it's very clear\n\n23:17.600 --> 23:25.680\nyou're in an apprenticeship and you're working really hard. And this middle card means this\n\n23:25.680 --> 23:33.520\nis a guy physically making coins. And he's working really hard to make coins. So she was\n\n23:33.520 --> 23:38.160\nsaying like, you know, that's what you're doing. That's like your life right now. That guy is\n\n23:38.160 --> 23:44.480\nthat guy. And the guy below is like this guy is who's like a who's like a who's like a humble\n\n23:44.480 --> 23:48.720\nwhatever. And he's working really hard. And then the thing the cards to the left was strength,\n\n23:48.720 --> 23:55.120\nwas a woman holding a lion's jaw open. And she was like, you're really strong and really great\n\n23:55.120 --> 24:01.280\nat what you're doing. And whatever, don't stop because the top card was some kind of sword\n\n24:01.280 --> 24:06.800\nthing. It was like a strong sword. And she was like, which means eventually, you will be like\n\n24:06.800 --> 24:11.280\nking, you're going to get to where you want to be. You're going to kill me. No, no, no. That's\n\n24:11.280 --> 24:16.240\nwhere this goes. If we're on Game of Thrones. I figured that I'm fine with that. But but but\n\n24:16.240 --> 24:22.640\nthe card to the right of the center was nine swords down. And she's like, this is a sad card.\n\n24:22.640 --> 24:27.280\nThis is like you're Jewish. He'll be sad for killing him. This is a huge card. She said that\n\n24:27.280 --> 24:32.560\nyou're going to have some kind of like emotional turmoil in the future that you'll have to work\n\n24:32.560 --> 24:37.920\nthrough, whether that's like an emotion, like like something internal. Yeah, bold prediction. Yeah.\n\n24:37.920 --> 24:44.880\nShe really risked a lot. There will be a death in your family. Eventually. I see good times and bad\n\n24:44.880 --> 24:49.840\ntimes. She brought it all back around. It was like, this is not the time for love or anything\n\n24:49.840 --> 24:55.520\nelse in your life, except for working as an apprentice. And you'll get to where a crewing\n\n24:55.520 --> 25:03.920\ndisposable income and frequent visits to me, your chiropractor. I mean, tarot card lady. They're\n\n25:03.920 --> 25:10.560\nall the same. They're all the same. All right. Back back on community. What is it? Okay. So these\n\n25:10.560 --> 25:17.280\nare phrases that I was supposed to work into the I just said. People might write down holy s. Maybe\n\n25:17.280 --> 25:21.280\nincorporate some of this dialogue. All right. Can we get like, let's try multitasking. I'm going\n\n25:21.280 --> 25:25.760\nto write. I'm going to try to finish this page while we talk about the fact that we were on the\n\n25:25.760 --> 25:29.600\nGame of Thrones yacht. Yeah, that was the game of Thrones yacht. It was the Justin\n\n25:29.600 --> 25:36.240\nRylan, Rick and Morty, Alex Hirsch, like, but apparently the Game of Thrones people really\n\n25:36.240 --> 25:41.440\nlike Rick and Morty. You walked down. Let me set the stage for you. Walk down at the back of the\n\n25:41.440 --> 25:46.960\nMarriott into Marina and you go to and I went through the gate and I said, where do we go? We're\n\n25:46.960 --> 25:50.480\non the F dock. Yeah, you see that boat down there? The one with the smokestack. I'm like,\n\n25:50.480 --> 25:57.280\nthe one that looks like the old yachts. I thought we're going to be on some like crappy little boat\n\n25:57.280 --> 26:02.960\nand we'd all be jammed on like a little tiny thing. It was this big ass yacht. And but like old\n\n26:02.960 --> 26:10.240\ntimey, it's a 1929 yacht called High Spirits. And it looks like the like the Rockefellers might\n\n26:10.240 --> 26:15.360\nhave fucked on that but yacht at one point. And there was there was veggie burgers and sliders\n\n26:15.360 --> 26:20.400\non top. And I didn't see those. You didn't go on top. No, I only did. I stopped when all of the\n\n26:20.400 --> 26:25.680\nGame of Thrones people were there. I got stuck. Spencer, you're nerding out. We have to get code\n\n26:25.680 --> 26:33.680\non which Spencer. I'll call you Carl. Carl and grammar. Yeah. Okay. Spencer G. Yeah. What up?\n\n26:33.680 --> 26:39.200\nWhat up? I didn't even cross your path, but then I'm walking through one of the like areas of the\n\n26:39.200 --> 26:43.200\nboat like around the bow and I turn a corner and I see a guy and he's this kind of good looking\n\n26:43.200 --> 26:50.320\nchubby dude. And I look and it's Samwell. Yeah. Like the guy that likes books. He killed the white.\n\n26:50.320 --> 26:56.160\nHe killed the white Walker with the dragon glass. I just walking through. I didn't know that there\n\n26:56.160 --> 27:02.720\nwas ever going to be Game of Thrones people. And I go, I try to go, Oh, and I put my hand out and he\n\n27:02.720 --> 27:07.920\ngives me like his kind of, you know, it's like kind of nervous, like Samwell hands. Is that his name?\n\n27:07.920 --> 27:15.600\nSamwell? I think so. Yeah. And he goes, Hey, I go, Oh, shit. I don't know his name. I'm like,\n\n27:15.600 --> 27:20.640\nI love you on the show. And he goes, Oh, that's really nice. I'm like, Jesus Christ. Then I turn\n\n27:20.640 --> 27:26.080\nthe corner and there's Ramsey. Yeah. Everybody's there. He's a lot less pale in real life. Also,\n\n27:26.080 --> 27:31.120\nhe's, he's, he's, he's, he's, he's quite, he's quite small. I didn't officially get to meet Ramsey,\n\n27:31.120 --> 27:35.840\nalthough he said, excuse me, as he walked by, I was, I walked up, I was, there were shots and\n\n27:35.840 --> 27:42.480\nJustin was doing shots and fucking Ramsey Bolton was doing shots. And his arms were sinewy and\n\n27:43.120 --> 27:50.240\nveins. And he's like, his veins and biceps. And then he spoke and he said, he was the same guy.\n\n27:50.240 --> 27:54.880\nHe said, that's the thing about the Game of Thrones people. I've never been that big a fan of\n\n27:54.880 --> 28:01.360\nanything that everybody has, all their faces were like, you're the guy, you're the person.\n\n28:01.360 --> 28:11.200\nAnd the, the, one of the actors was, she was the unassuming jolly lady. It was drinking and\n\n28:11.200 --> 28:16.560\neverybody's like, like, like, and she goes, I think her friend said, do you know who this is?\n\n28:17.440 --> 28:21.360\nAnd she's like, give her the look and she like makes this look. And I'm like, wait, I know that\n\n28:21.360 --> 28:26.480\nlook. And it's like, she's, she's, she's, she's the, she's the girl who truly has no name, who like\n\n28:26.480 --> 28:32.720\nstabs Arya. She's the fucking terminator of the. She is the terminator of a Game of Thrones.\n\n28:32.720 --> 28:39.760\nEverybody on the ship, there was a, Sir No Fingers and you know, I don't, Sir No Fingers was on\n\n28:39.760 --> 28:45.840\nthere. I mean, they say his character is going to come back from the dead, Sir No Fingers. He's\n\n28:45.840 --> 28:49.760\ngoing to grow all of his fingers back. The guy who, the guy who tried to close the deal at the\n\n28:49.760 --> 28:56.720\nIron Bank by going, look, he's, he's, he's great at accounting. That guy was hanging out. Everybody,\n\n28:56.720 --> 29:03.360\neverybody was, Spencer, Spencer G, you were saying that there was Davos? That's him, Davos, Sir No\n\n29:03.360 --> 29:09.280\nFingers. And, and, and the eunuch, the eunuch, Varys, Varys was there. I didn't see anything.\n\n29:09.280 --> 29:16.080\nWait, Varys was there? Varys was there because he had, and he had a tan. And so nobody recognized\n\n29:16.080 --> 29:20.720\nhim. He just looked like George Hamilton. My husband has known him for many years because he\n\n29:20.720 --> 29:24.720\nhas done, he worked in the London Theater. My, my husband was a firefighter, so he would work the,\n\n29:24.720 --> 29:28.880\nthe fire department stuff that they did. I don't know, they just walked shows basically. So he's\n\n29:28.880 --> 29:35.120\nknown him forever and he's Irish. And, and when I watched Game of Thrones, like, I really attracted\n\n29:35.120 --> 29:40.640\nto him. So it was really awkward. To the eunuch? Tonight. Yeah, I know. It's weird. I know. It's\n\n29:40.640 --> 29:48.480\nokay. I'm dealing with it. So, so I was, I was shocked and amazed that I had like a 10 minute\n\n29:48.480 --> 29:57.440\nconversation with him. That's my husband back there. I wish firefighter you're here. What's your\n\n29:57.440 --> 30:12.240\nname, sir? James. James. Hello, James. James. Um, but yeah, it was really amazing. Were you there on the yacht too, James? No, I mean, I'm\n\n30:12.240 --> 30:17.120\nembellishing now that I know they are here. Well, he's a eunuch, so it's fine. Exactly. Nothing can\n\n30:17.120 --> 30:22.560\nhappen. Yeah. Yeah. And he got his revenge. He got that whatever his name is. Is the guy in the box?\n\n30:22.560 --> 30:26.720\nThat potion guy in the box. How come we've never figured out where that box guy went to? He just,\n\n30:26.720 --> 30:29.600\nhe's somewhere. He just carries him with him every time he's traveling. Yeah, I don't know. It was just\n\n30:29.600 --> 30:34.160\nlike a glimpse of his back story. Right? And then it never got revealed later. I mean, can they bring\n\n30:34.160 --> 30:38.240\nthat back? There was a backdoor pilot about the box wizard that HBO was trying to shop around. They were\n\n30:38.240 --> 30:43.280\ngoing to do like a spin-off. The box wizard. Yeah, I feel like the rally were. Hello. My name's\n\n30:43.280 --> 30:53.440\nAmanda Faes Langwermer. Years ago, I horribly mutilated a child to get red magic from my blood\n\n30:53.440 --> 31:01.520\nto get the blood magic. I had no idea. He's gonna be like, this is my story. It was rough. It was\n\n31:01.520 --> 31:08.080\na rough episode. Okay. It was pretty, it was pretty amazing, actually, because I didn't really know\n\n31:08.080 --> 31:11.440\nwhat to expect to go on to that yacht. I thought I was just going to be like, I don't slam people,\n\n31:11.440 --> 31:15.920\nI'm rick and morty people, and then like the entire cast of Game of Thrones was there. So it was\n\n31:15.920 --> 31:20.720\njust a rick and morty and game of thrones party, which I thought was extremely exclusive. And I had\n\n31:20.720 --> 31:27.280\nno idea I fit into that crowd, like a hall-aged crowd. I was at the indigo room earlier.\n\n31:29.280 --> 31:32.720\nI had gotten the boat quite early before anybody was there. We got on very early,\n\n31:32.720 --> 31:38.640\nmy friend and I, and we came in there, and it's a boat built in 1929, and I'm six with four with\n\n31:38.640 --> 31:45.280\nlike heels on my shoes, like dress shoes. So I had to duck everywhere I go. So I'm hodor. I'm\n\n31:45.280 --> 31:50.880\nwalking through, like, I'm walking through things. And so I'm meeting people that are on Game of Thrones\n\n31:50.880 --> 31:58.160\nwho are quite, we, and, but, so I'm talking to them. Hello. Like I, my head is tilted. I didn't\n\n31:58.160 --> 32:03.120\nlike that. I felt like a weird character in the Game of Thrones. And apparently, so last night,\n\n32:03.120 --> 32:07.440\nthe rumors spread throughout the adult swim party that hodor was a DJ, and then he was DJing at\n\n32:07.440 --> 32:14.720\nthis club. The Omnia. So everybody was like, let's go see hodor DJ. And we went. So you and I and\n\n32:14.720 --> 32:18.880\nRyan Ridley and like a bunch of other people went to this club that was like, we were all dressed\n\n32:18.880 --> 32:24.480\nlike San Diego tourists. And the club was like velvet rope and just like very like, it was,\n\n32:24.480 --> 32:29.760\nit was like. And they spray this like cold air. Like no one from Comic Con was like,\n\n32:30.960 --> 32:35.760\nyou know, it was like, it was like bottle service, kind of like grody, grody chic. And,\n\n32:36.400 --> 32:40.320\nand then like, I got a text from somebody that I texted in a Hail Mary, and they said,\n\n32:40.320 --> 32:45.440\nsay this. And I said what they said and they were like, all right, come on in. And we were like,\n\n32:45.440 --> 33:03.600\nand it was like. And we were like, hold on. But like hodor wasn't there. But like Ridley and I\n\n33:03.600 --> 33:09.920\nwere just like, hold on. And we were also high and drunk. And so Ridley was like, Ridley was like\n\n33:09.920 --> 33:14.080\ndancing like in the front row of this thing. And I was just like whispering in his ear doing like\n\n33:14.080 --> 33:18.240\nthis hodor rap, like to the beat. I was like, hold door, hold the door, gonna hold the door,\n\n33:18.240 --> 33:21.760\nand then hold three more, gonna hold those doors and hold it's more, gonna hold every door, and\n\n33:21.760 --> 33:27.440\nyou go to the wall, hold on, go in the wall of World War three, gonna hold on, gonna hold the\n\n33:27.440 --> 33:30.800\ndoor for me, gonna hold the door, and then hold four doors, gonna hold some more doors, and then\n\n33:30.800 --> 33:38.240\nhold them all on. And he was like crying. And then we left like in five minutes. You left the\n\n33:38.240 --> 33:43.520\nmeeting. And you're like, bye. I need earplugs. We hung out for five minutes, I did hodor jokes,\n\n33:43.520 --> 33:49.360\nand then we left. Apparently hodor had been up there before we got there. Sorry, because I ran\n\n33:49.360 --> 33:56.800\ninto Jonah Ray. And he was like, did you guys go to the hodor show? And I was like, no, I guess he\n\n33:56.800 --> 34:00.960\ndidn't go to opera. And he's like, no, he was up before you guys got there. And it was like, so, okay,\n\n34:00.960 --> 34:05.920\nso what happened? He's like, he's just like a giant DJ. And he, and he was like, I guess he's like\n\n34:05.920 --> 34:12.080\nSwedish or who knows what, you know, and like, we only says one word anyway. He only says like\n\n34:13.280 --> 34:16.800\nflow, flow more. That's Jeff, that's Jeff. That's Jeff.\n\n34:16.800 --> 34:25.280\nYou should be DJ flow more. But, but he's like, Jonah said, like, yeah, he came up and was like,\n\n34:27.280 --> 34:33.280\nlike, go figure. And then he did that for a while and I was like, yay. And then, and then at one\n\n34:33.280 --> 34:38.000\npoint he dropped the beat and was like, how's everybody doing tonight? And, and, and everyone\n\n34:38.000 --> 34:49.600\nwent, hold on. And he went, he like shook it off. Like, we don't know if what did he think was\n\n34:49.600 --> 34:53.520\ngoing to happen? We don't know if he was bummed out. Like, does that mean he was he hated it?\n\n34:53.520 --> 35:01.120\nOr that's just from the Cirque du Soleil was here nine years ago. That was the last feather.\n\n35:01.120 --> 35:08.640\nActually, yeah, there's still acid on that. Yeah, he, I mean, I like that. It's like,\n\n35:08.640 --> 35:12.480\nlike Jonah raised impression of Hodor just like, he just, he just, it's like a golden retriever\n\n35:12.480 --> 35:18.480\ncoming out of a swamp. But we don't know loves it hates it. Well, who cares? He just like,\n\n35:19.520 --> 35:28.320\ntime to get back to French. And he's like, how's everybody doing? Hold on. That's just a job.\n\n35:28.320 --> 35:32.880\nEverybody, the Game of Thrones people are super chill and they're able to be because they're\n\n35:32.880 --> 35:41.360\nall foreigners. They don't like, they are like, like, like, like, Sam Well, who you see Sam Well,\n\n35:41.360 --> 35:48.240\nlike, like, you haven't lived, like this guy, but he looked exactly like you all look exactly like\n\n35:48.240 --> 35:52.560\nwhat they are. You give him one, you give him one fur vest and he's fucking ready to go exactly the\n\n35:52.560 --> 35:59.520\nfucking dudes like the guy Davos had the fucking beardage. It's all just hanging out and vaping\n\n35:59.520 --> 36:04.080\nand stuff. And I was like, and Sam Well had this fucking, he was just dressed like fucking like\n\n36:04.080 --> 36:09.280\na, like a, like a cool street magician. But he was like, but he's Sam Well, and I'm not saying\n\n36:09.280 --> 36:12.640\nlike he wasn't, he's not, he wasn't trying to pull anything off. Like he looked great. Like,\n\n36:12.640 --> 36:16.080\nbut he's just like, and you're like, Oh yeah, you look, you look great, but he's not Sam Well,\n\n36:16.080 --> 36:20.320\nhe's not wearing a leather cloak today, but he was like hanging out a black button up shirt.\n\n36:20.320 --> 36:25.760\nAnd he's like, yeah, hey. And I was like, so they're all from like Manchester and, and, and,\n\n36:25.760 --> 36:29.680\nand Belfast and all this stuff and they shoot in all these different cities. And so they just,\n\n36:29.680 --> 36:34.400\nthis was like their fourth Comic Con. And they, and I was like, I just kept asking the same question\n\n36:34.400 --> 36:38.480\nover and over again, which is like, how do you handle it? How do you do it? How do you bum? And\n\n36:38.480 --> 36:41.840\nI think they, that's the question we all ask them because we're all those like, Oh, what would\n\n36:41.840 --> 36:46.160\nhappen if you ever had this much? And I think because they're from Europe, they're kind of like,\n\n36:46.160 --> 36:51.520\nthey don't really even understand that question. Like, and not in a like a high roadie, humble,\n\n36:51.520 --> 36:56.640\nbraggy way. It's like, well, they don't, they don't have the same culture. And so it's like,\n\n36:56.640 --> 37:00.240\nthey're kind of like, this is amazing. And then they go, they're going to go back to Manchester\n\n37:00.240 --> 37:03.840\nand they hang out. I'm sure they're lying, you know, that they go home and they're like, I'm a\n\n37:03.840 --> 37:08.400\nfucking God. And they snort a million lines of cocaine. And there's like, fucking three, like\n\n37:08.400 --> 37:13.280\nchildren tied up and they're like, fuck you. I look at my phones all the time. I realized,\n\n37:13.280 --> 37:17.920\nI have to get out of here soon to get to the Balboa, do the show. And I went to say goodbye to\n\n37:17.920 --> 37:23.280\nyou, Dan. So like, I'm, I'm leaving soon. And I looked and Justin Reiland, whom I've known forever,\n\n37:23.280 --> 37:28.000\nbecause like channel 101 and the house of Cosby is and all the stupid stuff that we've made.\n\n37:28.000 --> 37:32.960\nAnd now Rick and Morty and he's up there and he's got like 19 glasses out. And it's just\n\n37:32.960 --> 37:38.240\nto keep the shots for all the Game of Thrones people. All of our nerdy friends and some of the\n\n37:38.240 --> 37:43.360\nGame of Thrones cast is fucking crazy. It was really cool. Yeah. I can't believe I didn't see\n\n37:43.360 --> 37:49.520\nJairus or Davos. Are you right right now? It was, it was pretty amazing. Yeah. Because I was\n\n37:49.520 --> 37:53.600\nwatching everybody line up at Holly, it's like my hotel room is from there. So everyone was just\n\n37:53.600 --> 37:58.160\nlike sleeping and down there. And I was like, God, I kind of wish I was down there too. But I have\n\n37:58.160 --> 38:03.760\nour panel today anyway. So to actually meet all of them, like just regular chilling on a boat was\n\n38:03.760 --> 38:09.760\ncool. Yeah. I wish that boat just kind of unmoored and just went out to sea. We just like, we'd\n\n38:09.760 --> 38:13.680\nprobably survive. I mean, they'd know how to do it. I don't know. People were pretty drunk.\n\n38:15.200 --> 38:18.080\nIt's okay. We can't live on those stale veggie burgers forever.\n\n38:19.680 --> 38:22.080\nI didn't have one. So sorry. Actually, they were pretty good.\n\n38:25.120 --> 38:26.080\nWere you all on the boat?\n\n38:26.080 --> 38:31.440\nDid you see the unfolds it? I mean, it's a treasure map.\n\n38:35.120 --> 38:37.920\nIt's a movie.\n\n38:47.920 --> 38:51.920\nNo one knows the words of that fucking. Yeah. It's a little bit for my time.\n\n38:51.920 --> 38:59.120\nWow. It's okay. Spencer T, let's talk about your strappy shoes. You got a back story for\n\n38:59.120 --> 39:03.360\nthese strappy shoes? They were $15. Oh, damn. They're on sale.\n\n39:05.760 --> 39:10.480\nThat's a good story. Thanks. No, I was wearing heels earlier and I just was like, fuck it.\n\n39:10.480 --> 39:16.160\nThis is ridiculous. Thank you. I was wearing heels last night and there were two girls behind\n\n39:16.160 --> 39:21.520\nme as I was walking back to our hotel after the Hodor event. And they were like, I can't\n\n39:21.520 --> 39:25.520\nbelieve she's wearing heels. How was she even surviving? I mean, if I had to wear heels and\n\n39:25.520 --> 39:30.320\nI was like, I'm not wearing heels tomorrow night. This is embarrassing now. I guess I should have.\n\n39:30.320 --> 39:35.840\nI should have a personal chauffeur is what I should have. Can I share a darker side of\n\n39:35.840 --> 39:42.240\nComic-Con with you guys? Please do. Because it's not all fun and games. I got in a cab,\n\n39:42.240 --> 39:49.280\nas one does, and the cab driver, he said, you're here for Comic-Con? I said, yes. And he said,\n\n39:49.280 --> 40:00.320\nhow's your humor? And I said, like the four humors? I said, I don't know. It's, it's not good. I don't,\n\n40:00.320 --> 40:08.000\nI don't know. And he said, well, can you tell me what the Joker calls Batman's motorcycle?\n\n40:08.000 --> 40:17.840\nAnd I was like, I kept, I ran through all the racist possibilities. I was like, I don't know,\n\n40:17.840 --> 40:23.920\nChinese, brown, I was just like racist, racist, racist. And then I was like misogyny, misogyny.\n\n40:23.920 --> 40:30.240\nLike what is it? How is this, how does this hurt people? Because a cab driver is asking me knock,\n\n40:30.240 --> 40:35.360\nknock. So how can the who's there hurt someone? And I was like, I don't know. And he said,\n\n40:35.360 --> 40:40.000\nso the question was, can you tell me what Joker calls Batman's motorcycle? And I said, I don't know.\n\n40:40.000 --> 40:47.920\nAnd he said, Yama ha ha ha ha. And then he just kept driving as if he hadn't ruined my day.\n\n40:50.240 --> 40:54.640\nHe was like, so anyways, left up here. I'm like, left up here. Life means nothing now.\n\n40:54.640 --> 41:00.320\nLet me out. Let me out. Yeah, like keep, drive faster and let me fucking jump out.\n\n41:00.320 --> 41:07.440\nAnd just let me dip my head out and just fucking shave back my brain off on the concrete so that\n\n41:07.440 --> 41:13.120\nI can lean back up and hopefully just fit in until I die. That never, never might be.\n\n41:13.120 --> 41:17.840\nThis is. It's so parallel to a joke. I heard a long time ago. What is Popeye's favorite book of the\n\n41:17.840 --> 41:28.160\nBible? Have a cook. It's the same joke. It's stupid. Stupid. It's not.

judge and then after a while the judge like goes around the bend uh and\n\n50:21.520 --> 50:26.160\nyou like just when you think you know who you're rooting for i don't know but it was how many\n\n50:26.160 --> 50:30.400\nof you are familiar with what i'm talking about just by a father okay so it's like yeah it went\n\n50:30.400 --> 50:34.320\nkind of sub viral it like you know there was a Kardashian doing something that day it was like\n\n50:34.320 --> 50:38.320\nit didn't it didn't quite make it but like when it was at its peak and we were like reading it in\n\n50:38.320 --> 50:42.400\nthe writers room rick and morty and then erica haze like one of our favorite storyboard artists\n\n50:42.400 --> 50:46.640\nat rick and morty justin reander her and said like can you just draw let's do because we were\n\n50:46.640 --> 50:50.640\nreading it out loud and i was like we should just do this like like and get it out put it on youtube\n\n50:51.600 --> 50:56.320\nso it was like draw rick and morty doing this scene and and justin's like yeah like morty should be\n\n50:56.320 --> 51:03.600\nthe judge and rick should be the uh the plaintiff uh or not the plaintiff the uh defendant yeah\n\n51:03.600 --> 51:09.520\nbecause it's the guy so so we do erica haze like uh like like i mean she fucking scrambled on it her\n\n51:09.520 --> 51:16.400\nher art is so great it's like like uh and justin like like recorded it in in the bay and like um\n\n51:16.400 --> 51:21.520\nit's it won't seem like 10 minutes in my opinion because i played it for you yeah it's the audio\n\n51:21.520 --> 51:24.960\nand it's like it goes by pretty quick but i would like it to be an hour i think the important thing\n\n51:24.960 --> 51:29.600\nyou have to understand is that this is word for word literally verbatim you can look it up online\n\n51:29.600 --> 51:36.240\nthis is absolutely word for word um not a single word is different from the actual court transcript\n\n51:36.240 --> 51:42.800\nthis actually happened in a courtroom recently in the 21st century without and it wasn't rick and\n\n51:42.800 --> 51:47.600\nmorty in in the court and it was not rick and morty although it seems like it was it's listening\n\n51:47.600 --> 51:55.040\nto and so can we just yeah let's do it oh oh oh you you need this uh\n\n52:00.960 --> 52:04.880\nso what i do think for those of you who might be like oh i'm listening to this on audio it\n\n52:04.880 --> 52:11.600\nactually no it functions fine as audio is all you're seeing is not very visual two images but but\n\n52:11.600 --> 52:17.120\nyeah they work well but i do i also have a clip of season three from season three of rick and\n\n52:17.120 --> 52:23.120\nmorty but i actually i i actually think this is like this is kind of the i mean i don't know\n\n52:23.680 --> 52:29.600\nyeah well it's arguably better but yeah this may never be seen again who knows uh maybe yeah\n\n52:29.600 --> 52:35.280\nlegally and maybe we can't we don't know yeah but it's like a public document it's like that was\n\n52:36.160 --> 52:42.080\nthat went over 10 times better than i thought i mean like i that's crazy\n\n52:43.520 --> 52:49.280\nthat actually all happened yeah i think you stole my phone oh yeah it's because i yeah it was it was\n\n52:49.280 --> 52:55.120\nborsa happens it was on my chair so i get to keep it i don't know where your phone is oh i\n\n52:55.120 --> 53:00.800\ni pick i feel like i i must admit did you check the other oh deep around the shuttle give it a\n\n53:00.800 --> 53:07.920\nblend i did oh yeah fucking amazing for a bag of coffee for a bag i there's so many i mean the guy\n\n53:07.920 --> 53:13.040\nlike they call him butt man like that's a truck fuck man that's a hero's journey because you don't\n\n53:13.040 --> 53:21.280\nknow like you start going like well it's probably hard to be a judge like that's the world of common\n\n53:21.280 --> 53:25.760\nday as joseph cambell would call it it's like it's probably hard to be a judge like these guys i'm\n\n53:25.760 --> 53:30.720\nsure they all have a big opinion about how they should how things should work and boy they're\n\n53:30.720 --> 53:35.600\nyou know just terrible like hard to deal with and they got nothing to lose and boy what a hard thing\n\n53:35.600 --> 53:39.520\nit is to be a judge and then you cross the threshold it's like the threshold for me is like\n\n53:39.520 --> 53:45.520\nexactly where the judge goes like you look like a queer and then the guy's like it's like it's like\n\n53:45.520 --> 53:50.880\nwell yeah as difficult as that guy was being like there was like the subtext to it where he's like\n\n53:50.880 --> 53:55.600\nyeah but if i just keep fucking poking you that's what trolling is so he's trolling it and it's\n\n53:55.600 --> 54:01.200\njust like if i if it's if it's possible for me to go like this enough that you eventually like\n\n54:01.200 --> 54:07.360\nengage in some crazy ass behavior then everything is retroactively invalidated but it's like you\n\n54:07.360 --> 54:11.440\ndon't deserve to be a judge's robe like because he got him to say like you look like a queer and\n\n54:11.440 --> 54:14.640\nhe's like you call him a queer i didn't say that i said you look like one but it's like he\n\n54:14.640 --> 54:19.120\nfucking popped his cork and he did it in exactly the point where the guy was like you want me to\n\n54:19.120 --> 54:23.760\nsuck your dick he was like psych like presiding over things and like bureaucratically like doing\n\n54:23.760 --> 54:27.200\nhis thing because it's like oh this guy wants to suck my dick and all this stuff and then he was\n\n54:27.200 --> 54:30.240\nlike how about you you want to suck my dick and he's like you know what you look like a queer\n\n54:30.240 --> 54:35.920\nand and then the shit went down a crazy road of trials where you're going back and forth like i go\n\n54:35.920 --> 54:40.000\nback and forth i'm like well okay the judge i'm on the judge's side and then i'm like on the guy's\n\n54:40.000 --> 54:44.560\nside and i don't know and the god the goddess point is of course like it's at the point where you\n\n54:44.560 --> 54:49.280\njust think of them as two lovers like you're like these guys are having a good time they're avid\n\n54:49.280 --> 54:53.760\nand castello like these guys should just live in an apartment together everything's fine and then\n\n54:53.760 --> 54:58.400\nas you reach that equilibrium the atonement with the father is i'm gonna kill your family i'm gonna\n\n54:58.400 --> 55:05.280\nkill your babies with a hammer and everyone goes silent everyone goes because there is a moment\n\n55:05.280 --> 55:09.360\nand then he goes like yeah he can't because it's like you can't have avid and castello with that\n\n55:09.360 --> 55:17.680\nguy he the both the judge and the guy like unwittingly achieved peace on earth by being like these\n\n55:17.680 --> 55:23.520\ncrazy archetypes like that there were more system than man and then the moment that they had equilibrium\n\n55:23.520 --> 55:28.720\nthe guy who has to subvert everything was like yeah well i'm isis like i'll fucking like i'll\n\n55:28.720 --> 55:32.480\nlike i'll take this to a place where you can't like i don't want the i don't want that warmth\n\n55:33.440 --> 55:37.840\ni can't have that i like when he says like because there was a moment when they seem to be laughing\n\n55:37.840 --> 55:43.200\nand having a good time at one point they're clearly going like okay 20 days 40 days 60 days a year\n\n55:43.200 --> 55:46.960\n10 years like you're in contempt like you're like you're not getting out of jail as you're\n\n55:46.960 --> 55:51.760\ncertainly going to trial and then he says i'll kill your whole family and he goes okay that's a\n\n55:51.760 --> 55:56.240\nterrorist threat like that's like a million dollars bond like that's a huge thing to threaten\n\n55:56.240 --> 56:00.560\nsomebody's life especially a judge that's a felony no matter what happened before that including the\n\n56:00.560 --> 56:06.960\njudge saying all the stupid shit he said at that moment um then things become absolutely\n\n56:06.960 --> 56:11.440\nhe doesn't care anymore then they become cathartic because because the guy's going because then the\n\n56:11.440 --> 56:15.760\njudge is whereas previously the judge is going well your mouth isn't big enough for my dick or\n\n56:15.760 --> 56:19.360\nmy mouth everybody like they're both like again they're like rolling around in the same mud but\n\n56:19.360 --> 56:25.120\nwhen the terrorist threat happens the judge gets back out of the mud and now everything is like\n\n56:25.120 --> 56:29.520\nwashed out and sad it's like a children's book where all the color has drained because you left\n\n56:29.520 --> 56:33.440\nit in the bathtub like it's the pages are puffy and things are just like you feel like it's been\n\n56:33.440 --> 56:38.720\nthrough a fire because then it's just like it's still funny and ironic but it's like now it's sad\n\n56:38.720 --> 56:42.880\nbecause it's just like okay now let's go through the motions you're a criminal i'm a judge like\n\n56:42.880 --> 56:47.120\nlike there's nothing fun about this let's keep danger at the door i don't but then it's like\n\n56:47.120 --> 56:51.600\nthen the crazy truth of i don't have a sister i don't have a niece i don't have a wife i don't\n\n56:51.600 --> 56:58.640\nhave anybody i don't have anyone ever i don't have i was born alone i will die alone and we don't\n\n56:58.640 --> 57:04.480\nknow i was lying about that i'm timely ripped yes and the fact that he's tracking it to the point\n\n57:04.480 --> 57:10.720\nthat like only a subredator would when he says why would i have grandkids if i don't have kids\n\n57:11.520 --> 57:17.600\nwe're like wait why are you tracking this yeah we are what were you logical all of a sudden he's\n\n57:17.600 --> 57:22.720\nasking questions than only a person that was like a fan of lost would ask in that moment my favorite\n\n57:22.720 --> 57:27.120\nmoment of lucidity from the defendant is when after he's gotten contempt of court like oh first\n\n57:27.120 --> 57:32.560\nlike he puts himself in contempt then he earns actual he holds himself into contempt into contempt\n\n57:32.560 --> 57:37.680\nwhich yeah which is great it's promethean yeah and then he gets then he gets held in the court's\n\n57:37.680 --> 57:42.480\ncontempt and he's gonna do time and then he threatens the guy's family goes okay we're gonna\n\n57:42.480 --> 57:47.040\nget the da on this that's a terrorist threat on my family and he doubles down i'm gonna come\n\n57:47.040 --> 57:51.120\nafter your whole family everybody and he's like okay well that's that's a terrorist threat and\n\n57:51.120 --> 57:58.560\nhe goes i don't belong in jail i was framed this lawyer wants to want to suck my dick for a bag of\n\n57:58.560 --> 58:03.840\ncoffee well do you understand though that that's not he's he he's referring to the bag of coffee\n\n58:03.840 --> 58:10.400\nthing he's referring to the crime so everyone wants to suck this guy's dick he the the reason he\n\n58:10.400 --> 58:14.720\nhas a lawyer was you put his first place is because a guy wanted to suck his big dick for a bag of\n\n58:14.720 --> 58:20.240\ncoffee that he was framed why can't we get this guy's dick on the witness and he's saying his\n\n58:20.240 --> 58:26.240\nlawyer wants to suck his dick or he won't represent him so he's just like he's in a you know a\n\n58:26.240 --> 58:31.600\ncycle of like this guy maybe has a beautiful dick like like we don't know or he looks like he's\n\n58:31.600 --> 58:35.760\nsomebody who would like like maybe we don't know i did i did look i don't think you suck a beautiful\n\n58:35.760 --> 58:39.920\ndick for a bag of coffee i think it's his own reward because there's enough racial illusions\n\n58:39.920 --> 58:44.400\nin the thing i did look it up because it's like i jack off on white boys and i said there's illusions\n\n58:44.400 --> 58:48.400\nto like cracker and stuff like that he's a white guy he's a this is a white guy just so you know\n\n58:48.400 --> 58:51.760\nit's like southern court i guess it's like you know that's where like he's you know it's like\n\n58:51.760 --> 58:57.200\nhe's like i i i i i jack off on white boys like he's like like you it's he also likes white\n\n58:57.200 --> 59:00.960\nthat he refers to the white boys as white boys but it's not weird when you think about it because\n\n59:00.960 --> 59:05.040\nit's like oh it's like this we have this yes we have this like prison system and it's like a class\n\n59:05.040 --> 59:08.720\nsystem and it kind of all actually starts to emerge and make sense oh yeah then he's just like\n\n59:08.720 --> 59:13.440\nhorrible way uh funniest parts of that though who is the uh the the woman that animate or\n\n59:13.440 --> 59:19.680\ndo the drawings for that uh erica haze uh the cuts to the the court stenographer yeah maybe\n\n59:20.480 --> 59:29.120\ngod that was brilliant yeah because he's like i'm just doing my job over here uh yeah i i mean i\n\n59:29.120 --> 59:34.960\ndon't know you know i look i we should we should show another we should show the rick and morty\n\n59:34.960 --> 59:40.000\nclip from the thing because all right yeah yeah let's do it this is just a quick clip honestly\n\n59:40.000 --> 59:43.520\nit won't follow that because that audio is so clean you understand you're gonna watch an animatic\n\n59:43.520 --> 59:48.320\nwe showed the one from the pickle episode at the panel this is a different thing this is an episode\n\n59:48.320 --> 59:56.480\nin which uh uh it takes place in a post apocalyptic uh future like a road warrior type uh future and\n\n59:56.480 --> 01:00:12.560\nuh they're probably you probably won't you know who knows there's no context it's an animatic\n\n01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:20.080\nall right eb white we yeah we satisfied that that end of the agreement we packed this theater\n\n01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:24.480\nby promising rick and morty clips and boy we delivered on that certainly nobody could ever\n\n01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:30.960\nsue us for that but i'm really fucking dropping the ball in this community

4\n\n01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:24.000\nas if season 3 was evidence that season 4 was good.\n\n01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:29.000\nIt hurts my fucking feelings.\n\n01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:34.000\nI pretty much innocently responded.\n\n01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:43.000\nAnd I guess it was a slow news day for something.\n\n01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:46.000\nI don't know.\n\n01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:52.000\nI'm not a

01:15:46.000\nWhat?\n\n01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:52.000\nUsually I throw stuff like that to a joke room.\n\n01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:56.000\nAnd they go...\n\n01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:01.000\nSo, Jeff, so

01:16:14.000\nNo, about life.\n\n01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:19.000\nYes, about all these shootings.\n\n01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:25.000\nI'm back.\n\n01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000\nGet out.\n\n01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000\nJeff yells.\n\n01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:30.000\nOh, it's getting serious.\n\n01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000\nIt's getting really serious right now.\n\n01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000\nShould I say...\n\n01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:40.000\nBy the way, Cody, Dan's girlfriend and I went to high school together.\n\n01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:41.000\nOh, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:16:41.000

over.\n\n01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:47.000\nBefore what?\n\n01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:48.000\nHow many pages do you need?\n\n01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:49.000\nWell, it needs to be an act.\n\n01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000\nI promised an act of the community movie.\n\n01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000\nSo, like, 15 pages?\n\n01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000\nI could probably do it, like, as people leave.\n\n01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000\nAnd then it'll be done.\n\n01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:00.000\nI think they get the idea that it's bad.\n\n01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:01.000\nOkay.\n\n01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:02.000\nI don't know.\n\n01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000\nThere's a Dr. Hooters.\n\n01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:05.000\nOkay.\n\n01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:06.000\nThat was cool.\n\n01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:07.000\nLet's meet some people.\n\n01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000\nWho and don't, you know, like, we got...\n\n01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000\nYou San Diego, you're awesome.\n\n01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:12.000\nYou're from all over.\n\n01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:13.000\nBy the way, I'm very curious.\n\n01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:16.000\nHow many of you are just from San Diego?\n\n01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:19.000\nAnd I don't mean just like that's not a good thing.\n\n01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000\nI just mean you're just here locally.\n\n01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:26.000\nSo, everyone else, just by a pleasure from somewhere else.\n\n01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000\nIt's much different from our last San Diego show\n\n01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000\nbecause we did a show at the...\n\n01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000\nTin Roof.\n\n01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:36.000\nAnd it was the Sunday after Comic-Con was all over.\n\n01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:39.000\nAnd it was actually really prominent.\n\n01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000\nIt was like San Diego natives\n\n01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000\nbecause it was like the Comic-Con had closed down.\n\n01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:47.000\nBut we've got real Comic-Con people, like pilgrimage.\n\n01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000\nWho's from real far away show of hands?\n\n01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000\nLike, you think you're super far away?\n\n01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:54.000\nLike, who's from out of country?\n\n01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000\nWhat's your country?\n\n01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000\nI bought tickets in South Korea that I moved to Italy\n\n01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000\nand I bought Harmontown tickets from Italy.\n\n01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000\nYou bought Harmontown tickets from Italy?\n\n01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000\nAfter moving from South Korea.\n\n01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:05.000\nWho came from farther than Italy?\n\n01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:06.000\nRight there in the middle?\n\n01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:07.000\nSouth Korea.\n\n01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000\nI bought Comic-Con tickets in South Korea.\n\n01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000\nBut you moved to Italy that bought Harmontown tickets.\n\n01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:12.000\nOkay, South Korea.\n\n01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:13.000\nCan you beat South Korea?\n\n01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:14.000\nThe hands went down.\n\n01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000\nAnybody beat South Korea?\n\n01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:17.000\nRight there?\n\n01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:23.000\nIreland doesn't beat South Korea in anything.\n\n01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000\nHere's what I'm really curious about.\n\n01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:28.000\nA lot of you came from far away.\n\n01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:31.000\nWho thinks that they have kind of a...\n\n01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000\nA knowledge of kimchi?\n\n01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000\nHere's what I'd like to do.\n\n01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000\nI'm going to tell you in advance.\n\n01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000\nYou're intelligent people so you can help me out here.\n\n01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000\nThis is the format I want to go for.\n\n01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:44.000\nI want to bring up one person that has a dark side of Comic-Con

--> 01:23:38.440\nThat's my scar.\n\n01:23:38.440 --> 01:23:39.440\nOkay.\n\n01:23:39.440 --> 01:23:40.440\nYou win.\n\n01:23:40.440 --> 01:23:41.440\nYou win.\n\n01:23:41.440 --> 01:23:42.440\nWhat

--> 01:23:50.440\nEyelid cell.\n\n01:23:50.440 --> 01:23:51.440\nCorrect.\n\n01:23:51.440 --> 01:23:52.440\nI don't even know.\n\n01:23:52.440 --> 01:23:53.440\nI've never heard that phrase.\n\n01:23:53.440 --> 01:23:56.440\nI thought Steve Jobs had like pancreatic.\n\n01:23:56.440 --> 01:24:00.440\nIt affects the pancreas but it attaches to the adrenal glands.\n\n01:24:00.440 --> 01:24:01.440\nEyelid cells?\n\n01:24:01.440 --> 01:24:02.440\nNo.\n\n01:24:02.440 --> 01:24:04.440\nEyelid.\n\n01:24:04.440 --> 01:24:05.440\nEyelid.\n\n01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:06.440\nEyelid.\n\n01:24:06.440 --> 01:24:07.440\nEyelid.\n\n01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:08.440\nYeah.\n\n01:24:08.440 --> 01:24:11.440\nBut all my doctors are from different countries so I have no idea what they're saying half\n\n01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:12.440\nthe time.\n\n01:24:12.440 --> 01:24:13.440\nThis is terrifying.\n\n01:24:13.440 --> 01:24:16.440\nI was 18 at the time.\n\n01:24:16.440 --> 01:24:17.440\nI'm all good now.\n\n01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:18.440\nWell, relatively.\n\n01:24:18.440 --> 01:24:19.440\nI have to go back.\n\n01:24:19.440 --> 01:24:20.440\nIt's life.\n\n01:24:20.440 --> 01:24:21.440\nYou've got to get on.\n\n01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:22.440\nYou've got to move forward.\n\n01:24:22.440 --> 01:24:25.440\nSo this is a year after you've been diagnosed with this?\n\n01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:26.440\nYeah.\n\n01:24:26.440 --> 01:24:27.440\nSo I was pretty upset.\n\n01:24:27.440 --> 01:24:31.440\nI bought $40 worth of food and it was like three things.\n\n01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:32.440\nWhich was one pretzel.\n\n01:24:32.440 --> 01:24:33.440\nYeah.\n\n01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:37.440\nWhich was one pretzel and they were like, hey, you want a water bottle?\n\n01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:38.440\nYou've got to give me a hand job.\n\n01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:40.440\nAnd I'm like, what the fuck?\n\n01:24:40.440 --> 01:24:46.440\nAnyway, so there was a conga line of Deadpool cosplayers and I was like, you know what?\n\n01:24:46.440 --> 01:24:52.440\nI could wait the two minutes for them to all finish up for me to finally sit down and\n\n01:24:52.440 --> 01:24:53.440\neat.\n\n01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:58.440\nAnd as I am like standing there, one of them looks at me.\n\n01:24:58.440 --> 01:24:59.940\nYou'll be me for a minute.\n\n01:24:59.940 --> 01:25:05.600\nAnd they look at my plate and it'll be your mic hand and then they were like, smack it\n\n01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:06.600\ndown.\n\n01:25:06.600 --> 01:25:07.600\nI know.\n\n01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:08.760\nIt broke my heart.\n\n01:25:08.760 --> 01:25:10.080\nYour $40 meal.\n\n01:25:10.080 --> 01:25:11.320\nMy $40 meal.\n\n01:25:11.320 --> 01:25:14.920\nSo I just haul off and punched the motherfucker out.\n\n01:25:14.920 --> 01:25:17.760\nWhat is this dental curse?\n\n01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:20.760\nAnd I think this is the reason why I hate Deadpool.\n\n01:25:20.760 --> 01:25:24.000\nAnd I just like haul off just right hook.\n\n01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.040\nAnd like I put all my energy behind it.\n\n01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:27.040\nAnd you're normally a puncher.\n\n01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:28.840\nHave you thrown punches in anger before?\n\n01:25:28.840 --> 01:25:34.280\nYou know, I've only been in one fight and it was like, you're 6'4\", I believe you\n\n01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:35.280\nsaid.\n\n01:25:35.280 --> 01:25:39.280\nYeah, he was 6'4\", and like, all the pounds.\n\n01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:42.600\nWait, that's every pound.\n\n01:25:42.600 --> 01:25:44.000\nThat is every pound.\n\n01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:45.000\nEvery single pound.\n\n01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:46.120\nThe pounds you can have.\n\n01:25:46.120 --> 01:25:49.080\nHe was like, hey, nerdy little white-ass motherfucker.\n\n01:25:49.080 --> 01:25:51.280\nDid you take him down?\n\n01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:54.640\nWell, no, I threw sand in his eyes, all the dales.\n\n01:25:54.640 --> 01:25:56.120\nWait, there's sand at the con...\n\n01:25:56.120 --> 01:25:57.120\nWhere were those nests?\n\n01:25:57.120 --> 01:26:00.600\nWell, this was at my old high school because we live in the desert.\n\n01:26:00.600 --> 01:26:03.520\nWait, is this chicken nugget, Deadpool guy?\n\n01:26:03.520 --> 01:26:04.520\nHold on.\n\n01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:05.520\nNo, no, no, no.\n\n01:26:05.520 --> 01:26:07.720\nThe first fight was all the pounds.\n\n01:26:07.720 --> 01:26:09.480\nDeadpool guy didn't weigh all the pounds.\n\n01:26:09.480 --> 01:26:10.480\nNo, Deadpool guy was like...\n\n01:26:10.480 --> 01:26:15.800\nThe first fight, you threw sand in his eyes, I kicked him in the shins, and I ran away.\n\n01:26:15.800 --> 01:26:18.120\nOkay, that's a good move.\n\n01:26:18.120 --> 01:26:19.120\nBut Deadpool guy...\n\n01:26:19.120 --> 01:26:20.120\nThat shit still works.\n\n01:26:20.120 --> 01:26:21.120\nYeah, it does.\n\n01:26:21.120 --> 01:26:22.120\nPocket sand.\n\n01:26:22.120 --> 01:26:25.480\nAnyways, Deadpool guy, like, I give a solid like...\n\n01:26:25.480 --> 01:26:27.400\nNo title, pocket sand.\n\n01:26:27.400 --> 01:26:32.000\nLike solid right hook, and I lean into it, and I fall forward and shit, and then like\n\n01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:37.800\nI finally realized what I did, and I was like, oh shit, I need to get out of here.\n\n01:26:37.800 --> 01:26:40.480\nBecause you got an angry conga line on your hands now.\n\n01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:41.480\nI do.\n\n01:26:41.480 --> 01:26:45.120\nA conga line of guys whose gimmick is having two swords each.\n\n01:26:45.120 --> 01:26:46.600\nYeah, and you know what?\n\n01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:50.960\nLike I realized what I did, and I was like, oh shit, I gotta get out of the convention.\n\n01:26:50.960 --> 01:26:52.800\nWhen you hit him, like, you hit him in the face?\n\n01:26:52.800 --> 01:26:53.800\nOh yeah.\n\n01:26:53.800 --> 01:26:54.800\nAnd you knocked him down?\n\n01:26:54.800 --> 01:26:55.800\nYeah.\n\n01:26:55.800 --> 01:27:03.520\nWith all the like energy that I had in my body, like, I was like, pah, and like he hits the\n\n01:27:03.520 --> 01:27:10.720\nground, and then I was there looking at my food for 10 seconds, and he's looking at me,\n\n01:27:10.720 --> 01:27:13.320\nor he's not looking at me, I don't know what the fuck he's looking at.\n\n01:27:13.320 --> 01:27:14.320\nYeah, you don't know.\n\n01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:15.320\nHe's got a mask on.\n\n01:27:15.320 --> 01:27:16.320\nAnother part of his gimmick.\n\n01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:17.320\nYeah.\n\n01:27:17.320 --> 01:27:21.800\nAnd then I was like, oh shit, like Comic-Con's the only thing I have.\n\n01:27:21.800 --> 01:27:27.280\nSo I like immediately walk out, and then about two years before that, some guy got stabbed\n\n01:27:27.280 --> 01:27:28.280\nin the eye by a pencil.\n\n01:27:28.280 --> 01:27:29.280\nRight.\n\n01:27:29.280 --> 01:27:30.280\nWe were talking about that earlier.\n\n01:27:30.280 --> 01:27:31.280\nYeah, that was crazy shit.\n\n01:27:31.280 --> 01:27:32.280\nWait.\n\n01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:33.280\nWas that you?\n\n01:27:33.280 --> 01:27:34.280\nYou can't do that.\n\n01:27:34.280 --> 01:27:35.280\nWait, wait, wait.\n\n01:27:35.280 --> 01:27:36.280\nBack to your story.\n\n01:27:36.280 --> 01:27:37.280\nWe'll read the newspaper about the pencil thing.\n\n01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:38.280\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:27:38.280 --> 01:27:39.280\nAnyways.\n\n01:27:39.280 --> 01:27:40.280\nWhat is it?\n\n01:27:40.280 --> 01:27:45.520\nYou knocked a Deadpool the fuck out, and just walked out, because you said, Comic-Con's\n\n01:27:45.520 --> 01:27:47.760\nall I have, and you just walked out?\n\n01:27:47.760 --> 01:27:50.040\nBecause Comic-Con was all I had, like.\n\n01:27:50.040 --> 01:27:52.480\nNow you can't come back, because here's a Deadpool killer.\n\n01:27:52.480 --> 01:27:53.480\nBut you have come back.\n\n01:27:53.480 --> 01:27:55.800\nBut you don't know what happened to the Deadpool guy.\n\n01:27:55.800 --> 01:27:56.800\nNo.\n\n01:27:56.800 --> 01:27:59.800\nI mean, if you're out here, I apologize.\n\n01:27:59.800 --> 01:28:00.800\nNo?\n\n01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:01.800\nNope.\n\n01:28:01.800 --> 01:28:02.800\nIs the Deadpool that got punched?\n\n01:28:02.800 --> 01:28:04.600\nI think the odds of that are low.\n\n01:28:04.600 --> 01:28:05.600\nPossibly.\n\n01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:09.920\nIt'd be amazing if he came up and was like, I fucking thought it would be very Deadpoolian\n\n01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:14.200\nof me to knock your sandwich out of your hand, and I'm so sorry that you got hit.\n\n01:28:14.200 --> 01:28:17.760\nBut he has a tattoo of three chicken nuggets on his shoulder, and he's like, I've come\n\n01:28:17.760 --> 01:28:18.760\nto kill you.\n\n01:28:18.760 --> 01:28:21.560\nLike, he's got a tear drop on his arm.\n\n01:28:21.560 --> 01:28:22.560\nOkay, well, that's it.\n\n01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:24.120\nI mean, I really thank you for sharing that.\n\n01:28:24.120 --> 01:28:26.960\nThat's a truly dark Comic-Con moment.\n\n01:28:26.960 --> 01:28:27.960\nThank you.\n\n01:28:27.960 --> 01:28:28.960\nJoseph, everybody.\n\n01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:29.960\nThank you.\n\n01:28:29.960 --> 01:28:30.960\nJoseph.\n\n01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:31.960\nHave a wonderful convention, everybody.\n\n01:28:31.960 --> 01:28:32.960\nThank you, Joseph.\n\n01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:36.040\nThat's interesting, because you have a mix of people walking around.\n\n01:28:36.040 --> 01:28:37.800\nYou don't know their back story.\n\n01:28:37.800 --> 01:28:42.240\nSome people, when we come here to surrender to a bigger thing than ourselves, like being\n\n01:28:42.240 --> 01:28:43.840\na nerd is about obsession.\n\n01:28:43.840 --> 01:28:46.400\nIt's about acquiescence to mythology.\n\n01:28:46.400 --> 01:28:47.760\nPeople are dressed up as these things.\n\n01:28:47.760 --> 01:28:54.800\nAnd I remember one of my first Comic-Con memories was seeing, there were two friends.\n\n01:28:54.800 --> 01:29:03.800\nOne was dressed as Jean-Luc Picard captain, and his friend was old-school Kirk captain.\n\n01:29:03.800 --> 01:29:11.880\nAnd the Kirk was having, he was on the floor, like he was having an episode.\n\n01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:16.560\nAnd the Jean-Luc Picard guy was like cradling him and going like, they weren't doing a bit.\n\n01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:22.400\nBut they were just two old friends, and one of them was having an actual heart attack.\n\n01:29:22.400 --> 01:29:23.400\nOh my God.\n\n01:29:23.400 --> 01:29:24.400\nAnyways.\n\n01:29:24.400 --> 01:29:25.400\nAll right.\n\n01:29:25.400 --> 01:29:26.400\nSo the light side of Comic-Con.\n\n01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:27.400\nMine's really happy.\n\n01:29:27.400 --> 01:29:28.400\nWhat is your name?\n\n01:29:28.400 --> 01:29:29.400\nBy design.\n\n01:29:29.400 --> 01:29:30.400\nMy name's Lara.\n\n01:29:30.400 --> 01:29:31.400\nHello, Lara.\n\n01:29:31.400 --> 01:29:32.400\nHi.\n\n01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:36.400\nWhat's your, yeah, what's the other side?\n\n01:29:36.400 --> 01:29:39.400\nI'm happy now, because it's kind of a bridge of where I started.\n\n01:29:39.400 --> 01:29:44.840\nI started coming to Comic-Con eight years ago with my dad and my cousin and my uncles,\n\n01:29:44.840 --> 01:29:47.240\nand we're all really into the same stuff.\n\n01:29:47.240 --> 01:29:51.800\nAnd we'd park our car at the Marriott across the street, and we'd pack a cooler full of\n\n01:29:51.800 --> 01:29:56.560\nbeer and sandwiches, and we'd all meet and drink in the parking lot.\n\n01:29:56.560 --> 01:29:57.560\nOh my God.\n\n01:29:57.560 --> 01:29:58.560\nLook, what book I found.\n\n01:29:58.560 --> 01:30:00.600\nWell, I met this guy, and oh, and I found this signature.\n\n01:30:00.600 --> 01:30:01.600\nOh my God.\n\n01:30:01.600 --> 01:30:03.800\nWell, I think I read his book, and it was so exciting.\n\n01:30:03.800 --> 01:30:06.880\nAnd it was kind of just this new universe that was opening up.\n\n01:30:06.880 --> 01:30:11.800\nAnd then I moved here to San Diego, partially because I liked it, because I visited for\n\n01:30:11.800 --> 01:30:16.640\nComic-Con, and I struggled for a long time being unemployed.\n\n01:30:16.640 --> 01:30:20.960\nAnd then I got a job with the newspaper here, the San Diego Union Tribune.\n\n01:30:20.960 --> 01:30:25.080\nAnd now I don't have to read the schedule, because it gets emailed to me, and I get invited\n\n01:30:25.080 --> 01:30:26.640\nto these cool press things.\n\n01:30:26.640 --> 01:30:29.520\nAnd I interviewed Farrell Audio yesterday.\n\n01:30:29.520 --> 01:30:32.520\nDan, you were supposed to be there, but you were double-booked.\n\n01:30:32.520 --> 01:30:33.520\nNo, double-booked.\n\n01:30:33.520 --> 01:30:34.520\nThat's the bummer.\n\n01:30:34.520 --> 01:30:35.520\nYou're the same man.\n\n01:30:35.520 --> 01:30:38.520\nI was punching a guy that took my chicken nuggets.\n\n01:30:38.520 --> 01:30:40.160\nTook your fucking $40 sandwich.\n\n01:30:40.160 --> 01:30:45.520\nAnd it's just so exciting, because I've watched it grown, and then in reflection, I can stare\n\n01:30:45.520 --> 01:30:49.600\nat it and go, oh, and it's watched me grow, and it's just exciting.\n\n01:30:49.600 --> 01:30:51.240\nI feel at home at Comic-Con.\n\n01:30:51.240 --> 01:30:52.240\nIt's like a mecca for you.\n\n01:30:52.240 --> 01:30:55.760\nYou can't even get absorbed by it.\n\n01:30:55.760 --> 01:30:56.760\nThat is it.\n\n01:30:56.760 --> 01:30:57.760\nThat's good.\n\n01:30:57.760 --> 01:31:04.320\nSo yeah, it's a goddess that gives with one hand and takes with the other, Comic-Con.\n\n01:31:04.320 --> 01:31:05.800\nI don't know what my point was.\n\n01:31:05.800 --> 01:31:07.680\nI just thought we could explore that.\n\n01:31:07.680 --> 01:31:08.680\nAnd we did.\n\n01:31:08.680 --> 01:31:09.680\nI think I did a good job.\n\n01:31:09.680 --> 01:31:10.680\nI think so.\n\n01:31:10.680 --> 01:31:13.280\nI think I did a good job with this podcast.\n\n01:31:13.280 --> 01:31:14.280\nNo I didn't.\n\n01:31:14.280 --> 01:31:16.920\nI need to make sure that their money was well spent.\n\n01:31:16.920 --> 01:31:19.920\nHey, I'm right over here.\n\n01:31:19.920 --> 01:31:22.560\nIt was well spent.\n\n01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:24.760\nAnd you were going to die at one point.\n\n01:31:24.760 --> 01:31:27.840\nOh, well, you know, I got to go back next month.\n\n01:31:27.840 --> 01:31:28.840\nIt's up in the air.\n\n01:31:28.840 --> 01:31:29.840\nCome give me a hug.\n\n01:31:29.840 --> 01:31:30.840\nAww.\n\n01:31:30.840 --> 01:31:31.840\nAww.\n\n01:31:31.840 --> 01:31:48.360\nI had the time of my life and I never felt this way before and I swear it's the truth.\n\n01:31:48.360 --> 01:31:49.360\nDo the lift.\n\n01:31:49.360 --> 01:31:50.360\nDo the lift.\n\n01:31:50.360 --> 01:31:51.360\nYou got to do the lift.\n\n01:31:51.360 --> 01:31:52.360\nUh

01:32:04.880\nWait, I think if Laura and Joseph get together, maybe we can do the lift.\n\n01:32:04.880 --> 01:32:08.360\nLaura, can you and Joseph team up and do the Dan Harmon line?\n\n01:32:08.360 --> 01:32:09.680\nWe had two Jennifer Greys.\n\n01:32:09.680 --> 01:32:10.680\nThat was the problem.\n\n01:32:10.680 --> 01:32:11.680\nYeah, exactly.\n\n01:32:11.680 --> 01:32:12.680\nThere wasn't a Swayze among us.\n\n01:32:12.680 --> 01:32:13.680\nOh, you guys are good.\n\n01:32:13.680 --> 01:32:14.680\nOkay.\n\n01:32:14.680 --> 01:32:15.680\nOh my god.\n\n01:32:15.680 --> 01:32:16.680\nThis

yourself.\n\n01:32:19.680 --> 01:32:20.680\nI had the time of my life.\n\n01:32:20.680 --> 01:32:27.680\nFrom the legs, Laura.\n\n01:32:27.680 --> 01:32:28.680\nFrom the legs.\n\n01:32:28.680 -->

nervous?\n\n01:32:41.680 --> 01:32:42.680\nI was feeling sorry.\n\n01:32:42.680 --> 01:32:43.680\nI'm really sorry.\n\n01:32:43.680 --> 01:32:44.680\nWe got to first base.\n\n01:32:44.680 -->
