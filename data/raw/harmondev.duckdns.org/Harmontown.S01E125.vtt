00:00.000 --> 00:16.500
Ladies and gentlemen, Harmontown is now in session.

00:16.500 --> 00:34.500
And now, please welcome the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon!

00:34.500 --> 00:43.500
It really worked out okay? Did that work? Okay, all right, we had a little false start there. Sure you don't want to, because we can pick it up.

00:43.500 --> 00:50.500
All right, okay, you don't want to get a better, all right, because it seemed a little dry.

00:50.500 --> 00:58.500
Sad. All right, Comptroller Duncan Trestle, things are going on.

00:58.500 --> 01:12.500
How are you? I'm great, man. Thanks for asking. How you been? How's the tour going? It's going great. I've said I got nothing in the past, but really, I'm just rung like a rag.

01:12.500 --> 01:22.500
I did San Francisco, I did Austin, I did Houston in the last three days, and I went to Communicon. A lot of these people are here from Communicon.

01:22.500 --> 01:40.500
Communicon, Duncan, home of the Communicorn. Wow. Oh wow, you know, I had a, in Vancouver, my cab driver asked me if I believed in unicorns and then started presenting a very convincing argument for the existence of unicorns in Africa.

01:40.500 --> 01:46.500
Really? Yeah, it was a long conversation.

01:46.500 --> 02:02.500
I didn't even know there was like a, I didn't even know that it was possible. It was so beautiful, his belief in unicorns. It was incredible, and I realized he kind of looks like a unicorn, and I started thinking, oh, he's a unicorn driving a cab.

02:02.500 --> 02:12.500
He was saying unicorns exist, and does he think there's a cover-up? Yes.

02:12.500 --> 02:16.500
Because the missing ingredient of this is there would have to be a cover-up.

02:16.500 --> 02:26.500
My friend, all roads lead to reptilians when you believe in unicorns, because it ventured into the reptilian realm after he was explaining.

02:26.500 --> 02:41.500
Like once I told him, I definitely believe in unicorns, but I don't, but you know, like coast to coast, you know the show, Coast to Coast, when he's listening to people who believe in interesting ideas, he will just let them talk about it.

02:41.500 --> 02:51.500
Is that Art Bell? It's Art Bell. Now it's George Noray now, isn't it? Art Bell's coming back again, but he was the master of bringing out a person's story.

02:51.500 --> 03:06.500
So yeah, what he said is that he went up into the woods for a long time, and he got the ability to pet squirrels, like squirrels wouldn't run from him anymore, because he had become so pure.

03:06.500 --> 03:11.500
So that happened to him, and then he saw a unicorn, but he wasn't in Africa.

03:11.500 --> 03:16.500
He never saw a unicorn, but it's the theory that unicorns will only come to someone who's very pure.

03:16.500 --> 03:22.500
So his point is, you know, you start with squirrels, it's like a starter unicorn.

03:22.500 --> 03:42.500
Squirrel is like a burner cell phone for the aspiring drug dealer that is a unicorn handler. You're not Gus Fring just yet, you just got your little card, your little pay card.

03:42.500 --> 04:02.500
I feel like that is something that's a conversation that I would never have with a cab driver, and when I'm with Dino Stamatopoulos, I feel like I witness it happen within 10 minutes, it'll turn out, if the bartender is into SNM, it will come out.

04:02.500 --> 04:19.500
And Dino never says anything, he doesn't like walk around going, who's into SNM? But the bartender will just volunteer, because I'm near Dino, like she'll go, so did you want a rum and coke?

04:19.500 --> 04:36.500
Okay, here you go, like, can I tell you something crazy? And it's uncanny, and I think with you, I think this is a thing with people, like I think we emit like an aura, a pheromone or something, we kind of, it must be, right?

04:36.500 --> 04:56.500
I think so, it's, yeah, that's cool, I mean, I'd much rather somebody talk about SNM than unicorns, but on to say, actually, kind of, I like them both, but yeah, I know what you mean, this is something that is a chaos magic practice where you look at the entire universe as an oracle,

04:56.500 --> 05:07.500
and when you go out into the universe with the intention of learning something, it will start talking to you, and whatever you're putting out, it'll reflect back and give you a chance to learn more about the universe.

05:07.500 --> 05:30.500
In this case, it was unicorns, man, but they, you know, the idea behind unicorns is that he knew all these crazy unicorn details, like, they carry a baby for two years in their stomach.

05:30.500 --> 05:43.500
Is it because the horn? Like, you should get a baby unicorn out of you as soon as possible, I would think, depending on how that horn works.

05:43.500 --> 05:48.500
Well, it's, the horn is a receiver, the horn acts as a kind of antenna, according to him.

05:48.500 --> 06:07.500
Right, because nothing in nature has no purpose, like God knows deer who have, like, way more than a unicorn horn, they're receiving all kinds of magic. No, they're just deer, this guy doesn't give a shit about deer, even though they have way more horns than unicorns.

06:07.500 --> 06:20.500
I just thought that was kind of odd, like, unicorns, they're not that remarkable, they're just a horse with one shitty horn. It's like, they're almost less remarkable looking than a deer.

06:20.500 --> 06:28.500
That's right, yeah, they are, I guess they're albino, there's something about them, they're sort of white in glory.

06:28.500 --> 06:31.500
Big deal, there's white horses. Big deal.

06:31.500 --> 06:38.500
They're blood kills illnesses. They're blood kills, you're just quoting, like, the monster manual.

06:38.500 --> 06:54.500
I'm saying that the image of a unicorn, like, it's just a horse with a horn, that's the bare minimum requirement of a unicorn, and I think it's kind of funny, because if you add a second horn, you immediately get, like, a gazelle.

06:54.500 --> 07:01.500
And, like, a shitty one, too, because it's, like, not curved yet, and you're like, oh, look at that shitty gazelle.

07:01.500 --> 07:05.500
Oh, that's not a shitty gazelle, that's a double unicorn.

07:05.500 --> 07:10.500
Alright, well, excuse me for not.

07:10.500 --> 07:16.500
Speaking of unicorns, I'd like to talk about disabled people.

07:16.500 --> 07:36.500
I was at Communicon today, and there's always, like, my heart always, it kind of fractures a little bit, because there's invariably, if I do, like, a WGA panel or something like that, this doesn't happen enough, but it happens frequently enough that I've marked the memory.

07:36.500 --> 07:48.500
It's like, someone in a wheelchair will come up, and they will want to talk about the really conspicuous lack of differently-abled people on television.

07:48.500 --> 08:05.500
I have an inherent, because I'm a big drunk slob, like, my job is to, like, be a curmudgeon, and I'm not a big fan of the idea of TV characters as ambassadors, you know, but, you know, I think that that's an unavoidable thing,

08:05.500 --> 08:14.500
and I do think it's notable. I think it's a fucked up thing that when somebody in a wheelchair, you know, rolls into a room, we all have a reaction where we kind of start to treat them like a living ghost,

08:14.500 --> 08:19.500
because we don't, for the best reason, which is we don't want people to feel pain.

08:19.500 --> 08:33.500
And then there's always somebody, there's this wonderful young lady who came up to me as an aspiring writer who was at Communicon, I don't think she made it here to the show, but she was at Communicon, I think her name was Lara.

08:33.500 --> 08:45.500
And she's, you know, I had a long talk with her about this, and I've had this talk before, which is that, you know, I guess the reason I'm bringing this up is because this is a podcast.

08:45.500 --> 08:54.500
If you're in a wheelchair and you're out there, unless you're just in one because you think it's comfortable, I'm not talking to you if that's the case.

08:54.500 --> 09:09.500
You're weird, yeah, that's weird. If you're differently abled and you are watching television and you're watching all these jagg-offs, walk around, not in wheelchairs,

09:09.500 --> 09:16.500
and you're waiting for that character to come on screen in a wheelchair, and then they do, and it's like the kid from Glee.

09:16.500 --> 09:31.500
And it leaves you a little empty inside like a Snickers bar. It's packed with peanuts, but it did not satisfy, because ultimately, what is a person that has never come from that point of view going to do?

09:31.500 --> 09:38.500
What is the best job a writer could ever do? The best job they could ever do from the most humanitarian instinct in the world is they're going to write a shitty character.

09:38.500 --> 09:46.500
They're going to write the definition of a shitty character. They're going to write a character sitting in a chair with wheels on it that happens to be totally infallible and innocent.

09:46.500 --> 09:56.500
And ultimately, it leaves you continually with sort of a bad taste in your mouth. It's nice to have screen time, but ultimately, kind of part of the problem.

09:56.500 --> 10:09.500
And she actually said that they have a phrase for it among the community. They call it inspiration porn, when there's a character in a wheelchair and they can do anything.

10:09.500 --> 10:20.500
I remember a different Strokes episode where Arnold made friends with a kid in a wheelchair, and there was the big moment in the different Strokes episode where Arnold said,

10:20.500 --> 10:28.500
hey, we're having a good time. Come upstairs. I want to show you my goldfish. And he started running halfway up the stairs, and then he turned around.

10:28.500 --> 10:41.500
And he said, oh, oh, God, I forgot. And the kid in his wheelchair at the bottom of the stairs said, Arnold, that's the best thing any of the ones ever said to me.

10:41.500 --> 10:53.500
And that's sort of where we peed. I mean, we haven't really progressed beyond that from the Reagan era in terms of television's treatment of being differently abled.

10:53.500 --> 10:58.500
What kind of sad life did that wheelchair kid have? That's the best thing anyone ever said.

10:58.500 --> 11:03.500
That's the best thing that could happen to me is you totally fucking forgot what my actual...

11:03.500 --> 11:12.500
Yeah, but I don't want to throw that under the bus because at least somebody was doing something even at that point.

11:12.500 --> 11:22.500
I'm bringing this up not because I don't want to talk to my fellow fat white straight male writers that are out there.

11:22.500 --> 11:34.500
We'll keep doing what we're doing. But I really... God damn it, if you have the slightest thing wrong with you, start writing. God damn it.

11:34.500 --> 11:43.500
Because all of TV is written by people who are just... The career is one of privilege. It takes a support system to pursue a career in writing.

11:43.500 --> 11:55.500
And so if you do find yourself wondering why television stinks for you personally, if you can muster it at all, if you can weather that storm,

11:55.500 --> 12:05.500
get that script out there, mother. Because once somebody goes to prison and then writes about it, we get to have an orange as the new black

12:05.500 --> 12:11.500
and we don't have to sit and occupy our minds with questions about whether or not it's authentic and blah, blah, blah.

12:11.500 --> 12:19.500
And progress starts to happen in terms of television. What we really want is just transparency and honesty and stuff.

12:19.500 --> 12:27.500
I was taken with that most of all. All the Communicon people, my heart goes up and down and go all over the walls.

12:27.500 --> 12:37.500
You'll never have such an intense minute with one person as you do and somebody is watching your broadcast network television show.

12:37.500 --> 12:43.500
They have one minute to explain to you, my brother committed suicide. This got me through this.

12:43.500 --> 12:49.500
These things that aren't meant to be fit into the can of one minute, they have to be. Otherwise, they...

12:49.500 --> 12:52.500
How do you deal with that? How do you deal with that? Because that isn't...

12:52.500 --> 13:09.500
Easy for me. I'm just sitting there going, well, that's great. Sounds like a good job getting over it. Glad I could help. Looks like I nailed it.

13:09.500 --> 13:13.500
Oh, do you want a picture?

13:13.500 --> 13:21.500
They're the ones trying to explain to someone. You created something that really meant something to me.

13:21.500 --> 13:31.500
And their bodies tremble and their eyes water and their spines shake because everything's so symbolic.

13:31.500 --> 13:37.500
I haven't earned that. It has nothing to do with me. It's the show. It's a show that 200 people make over five years.

13:37.500 --> 13:46.500
It's something to me and they have that one moment and they vibrate. Their transmission is overwhelmed.

13:46.500 --> 13:55.500
They're the ones that have the challenge. I'm just like, Robert Zemeckis going, oh, yeah, the Lurians are great.

13:55.500 --> 14:02.500
I frankly enjoy it because it would make me feel like a worse person if a line of people came up and said,

14:02.500 --> 14:10.500
your job makes me doing nothing worth everything.

14:10.500 --> 14:19.500
It's a way for me to trick myself into thinking of being a rich writer, writing an opiate for the masses is actually not what it is.

14:19.500 --> 14:25.500
Because someone's going, no, man, my mom left my dad and I was all fucked up and your show helped me.

14:25.500 --> 14:29.500
I'm like, see, I told you I was a good person.

14:29.500 --> 14:37.500
I did that with Lou Barlow once. I freaked out and did the transmission breaking down when I got around Lou Barlow in L.A. when I met him

14:37.500 --> 14:45.500
and it was the most humiliating, mortifying moment in my life because I went to him trying to express this idea that,

14:45.500 --> 14:51.500
oh, fuck your music got me through so much and helped me feel like I wasn't insane.

14:51.500 --> 15:02.500
And it came out like, you're so great, man. And he looked at me like, okay, it was awful because I failed that bad

15:02.500 --> 15:07.500
and even talking that I embarrassed both of us and it was an awkward moment.

15:07.500 --> 15:11.500
And his friends looked, everyone was like, oh, fuck.

15:11.500 --> 15:17.500
But I guess it rains on him like that, like hipsters come up stammering to him nonstop.

15:17.500 --> 15:28.500
And I don't think, assuming Lou Barlow is exactly like me, I would wager that the response under which you're projecting,

15:28.500 --> 15:34.500
oh, I fucked up and you're a jerk, what you're perceiving is them going like,

15:34.500 --> 15:41.500
I can't do anything with simply the root message that what's happening right now is difficult for you.

15:41.500 --> 15:44.500
All I can do is continue to stand by it.

15:44.500 --> 15:49.500
Because what would you say if somebody said, this is really difficult for me, I don't know what to do.

15:49.500 --> 15:56.500
My Wisconsin fiber will not allow me to say, it's okay, just let it out.

15:56.500 --> 16:02.500
There's nothing I can say that won't make me a douche, except so I'll just silence is what you need to do.

16:02.500 --> 16:04.500
You just go like, all right, okay.

16:04.500 --> 16:11.500
But then I think if you are that nervous as we all have been, if I got in an elevator with Bob Odenkirk or Bill Murray or something,

16:11.500 --> 16:18.500
like I have been in this situation, I have made an ass of myself and because I wanted to say so many things,

16:18.500 --> 16:20.500
I'd have one minute to say them.

16:20.500 --> 16:29.500
I think that then in those moments, hey, calm down.

16:29.500 --> 16:40.500
All right, I'm trying to talk about something.

16:40.500 --> 16:47.500
Okay, maybe we'll put a pin in what I was discussing.

16:47.500 --> 17:00.500
Because a friend of mine thought it might be a good idea to drop by and I said, hey, if you can, poke your head.

17:00.500 --> 17:04.500
They have somebody give me the high sign and he just stepped into the spotlight.

17:04.500 --> 17:10.500
Oh, awesome. I didn't know what I was like, oh, if you've been in an elevator with Bob Odenkirk or something,

17:10.500 --> 17:13.500
just you're like freaking out.

17:13.500 --> 17:15.500
Oh, I get it now.

17:15.500 --> 17:16.500
Cool.

17:16.500 --> 17:45.500
Let's all get into an elevator right now with Joel McKell.

17:45.500 --> 17:53.500
Yeah, double mic, yeah.

17:53.500 --> 17:55.500
Say it.

17:55.500 --> 17:57.500
Joel just worked the room.

17:57.500 --> 17:59.500
It's an audio podcast, so I'm doing play by play.

17:59.500 --> 18:01.500
You do it, you get on there.

18:01.500 --> 18:04.500
Danny Pooty, ladies and gentlemen, Danny Pooty.

18:04.500 --> 18:09.500
Danny Pooty, ladies and gentlemen, Danny Pooty.

18:09.500 --> 18:16.500
That's the skinniest hipster here.

18:16.500 --> 18:17.500
Hi.

18:17.500 --> 18:18.500
Hey, how are you?

18:18.500 --> 18:20.500
Sponsored by Kettle, huh? What a surprise.

18:20.500 --> 18:25.500
I know that you're the sponsor of like a rival vodka company.

18:25.500 --> 18:26.500
I am.

18:26.500 --> 18:30.500
So please rip the labels off of these, my friend.

18:30.500 --> 18:35.500
Yes, Purity Vodka, way better than Kettle Ones.

18:35.500 --> 18:46.500
It's from Sweden. Good thing it's not from Germany because it's called Purity.

18:46.500 --> 18:48.500
Dan, I have seen you twice in two weeks.

18:48.500 --> 18:49.500
I know, it's crazy.

18:49.500 --> 18:50.500
It's really weird.

18:50.500 --> 18:52.500
It's like we're getting back to work or something.

18:52.500 --> 18:53.500
Hello, Jeff.

18:53.500 --> 18:57.500
Hello, I'm not Jeff.

18:57.500 --> 19:01.500
That'd be amazing if Jeff changed into this somehow.

19:01.500 --> 19:05.500
It would be a weird turn for him.

19:05.500 --> 19:07.500
Have you ever met Duncan Tressel?

19:07.500 --> 19:09.500
Have I ever met Duncan Tressel?

19:09.500 --> 19:13.500
No, I saw you at a party, but we never, I don't know.

19:13.500 --> 19:14.500
At Dance House?

19:14.500 --> 19:15.500
Yeah, at Dance House.

19:15.500 --> 19:17.500
Oh yeah, we had a great conversation.

19:17.500 --> 19:18.500
It was, we didn't.

19:18.500 --> 19:19.500
No, I don't remember him at all.

19:19.500 --> 19:21.500
We didn't talk.

19:21.500 --> 19:23.500
You seemed terrific.

19:23.500 --> 19:24.500
You seemed lovely.

19:24.500 --> 19:26.500
How was Communicon today, everyone?

19:26.500 --> 19:32.500
Yeah, how'd it go?

19:32.500 --> 19:33.500
It was good.

19:33.500 --> 19:36.500
I talked to a person in a wheelchair.

19:36.500 --> 19:37.500
Oh, sorry.

19:37.500 --> 19:39.500
I did great.

19:39.500 --> 19:41.500
No, no, it's good.

19:41.500 --> 19:42.500
Sorry.

19:42.500 --> 19:50.500
How much longer did they have?

19:50.500 --> 19:55.500
Until they finished their Modern Family spec, only three weeks.

19:55.500 --> 19:56.500
She's out there.

19:56.500 --> 19:58.500
Lara, now the pressure's on.

19:58.500 --> 20:01.500
Are we going to have a person in a wheelchair for a community?

20:01.500 --> 20:04.500
That's what I was talking about right before you came.

20:04.500 --> 20:11.500
I would like to be the sitcom that does that in a way that doesn't make everyone feel like

20:11.500 --> 20:13.500
a goddamn asshole.

20:13.500 --> 20:18.500
I hate the fact that, yeah, I don't know.

20:18.500 --> 20:24.500
We brainstormed in the room once, we were talking about the Down syndrome thing.

20:24.500 --> 20:25.500
There are sitcoms.

20:25.500 --> 20:28.500
We've seen characters with Down syndrome come on screen.

20:28.500 --> 20:34.500
It's also like, oh, these are some of the most joyful, entertaining people in the world,

20:34.500 --> 20:38.500
but there's this social stigma where you feel like if you're laughing because of a person

20:38.500 --> 20:42.500
with Down syndrome that you're laughing at them or that you're automatically a bully.

20:42.500 --> 20:46.500
One of the most ironic things in the world happens because I don't think it's politically

20:46.500 --> 20:56.500
correct to say that Down syndrome people are generally incredibly joyful people that cause

20:56.500 --> 20:58.500
a lot of mirth in people.

20:58.500 --> 21:02.500
It is one of the very positive side effects of it.

21:02.500 --> 21:07.500
The people that work with them are the ones that say so, so I am not too worried about

21:07.500 --> 21:15.500
saying that.

21:15.500 --> 21:21.500
When you see them on TV, again, it's like, okay, clear the runway, let's all be cool,

21:21.500 --> 21:24.500
the president's in town, let's cool it.

21:24.500 --> 21:30.500
The question becomes like, how would 30 Rock have a Down syndrome character and not be

21:30.500 --> 21:32.500
pandering and stuff like that?

21:32.500 --> 21:38.500
We had talked in the writer's room, a community about what would it be?

21:38.500 --> 21:41.500
What if you made them a huge asshole?

21:41.500 --> 21:46.500
What we were going to do was create a character named Michael who was just the guy that he

21:46.500 --> 21:52.500
comes in and every time the dean wants to tell everybody something shitty, he sends

21:52.500 --> 21:59.500
Michael.

21:59.500 --> 22:05.500
So Michael comes in and it's just like if the teacher's salaries are getting lowered,

22:05.500 --> 22:07.500
the lunch menu is gone.

22:07.500 --> 22:09.500
Please tell me you'll do that.

22:09.500 --> 22:12.500
How often do you say things here that actually wind up there?

22:12.500 --> 22:15.500
Plenty.

22:15.500 --> 22:17.500
That would be great.

22:17.500 --> 22:20.500
That was a good market test.

22:20.500 --> 22:22.500
They responded well to that.

22:22.500 --> 22:24.500
I feel like that way it's like everyone's in on the joke.

22:24.500 --> 22:26.500
Nobody's even being made fun of.

22:26.500 --> 22:31.500
It's like the joke becomes how society perceives and what all society is kind of strange,

22:31.500 --> 22:33.500
catechesis and things.

22:33.500 --> 22:39.500
Also how do you do that with people who are physically differently able?

22:39.500 --> 22:41.500
Have you seen the New American Horror Story?

22:41.500 --> 22:42.500
No.

22:42.500 --> 22:44.500
It's amazing.

22:44.500 --> 22:46.500
Jessica Lange is so strange.

22:46.500 --> 22:48.500
Is that what you're talking about?

22:48.500 --> 22:50.500
No, but it is super cool.

22:50.500 --> 22:55.500
They use people who have actual disabilities and it's amazing.

22:55.500 --> 22:57.500
It doesn't seem exploitive at all.

22:57.500 --> 22:59.500
Yeah, Chevy's on the show.

22:59.500 --> 23:05.500
You're right. Too soon.

23:05.500 --> 23:10.500
I mean, within three years it'll be too late.

23:10.500 --> 23:15.500
Now is the time to make these jokes, people.

23:15.500 --> 23:19.500
Chevy would appreciate these jokes, believe me.

23:19.500 --> 23:21.500
He would love these jokes.

23:21.500 --> 23:24.500
He would be the first to be laughing at them.

23:24.500 --> 23:30.500
And by laughing, I mean, you know, calling us fat queers.

23:30.500 --> 23:33.500
It is his way of responding positively to us.

23:33.500 --> 23:35.500
The term of affection.

23:35.500 --> 23:38.500
That was his Christmas card.

23:38.500 --> 23:41.500
I love you, you fat queer.

23:41.500 --> 23:43.500
Chevy.

23:43.500 --> 23:47.500
So what have you been up to between, during community's death?

23:47.500 --> 23:51.500
How did you spend your Easter?

23:51.500 --> 23:56.500
Well, I saw my grandma.

23:56.500 --> 23:58.500
She's 95.

23:58.500 --> 24:01.500
I did a lot. She's great. She's racist.

24:01.500 --> 24:04.500
But she has to be.

24:04.500 --> 24:06.500
If she wasn't, then...

24:06.500 --> 24:08.500
No, my grandma will...

24:08.500 --> 24:10.500
This is my 95-year-old grandma.

24:10.500 --> 24:14.500
She will go, why do you have to say fuck so much?

24:14.500 --> 24:17.500
And I was like, I just fucking have to, grandma?

24:17.500 --> 24:21.500
I don't know. I think I'm sure you've told the story a million times,

24:21.500 --> 24:25.500
but we didn't know it was going to be picked up until the last hour.

24:25.500 --> 24:30.500
It was like at 4.30 in the afternoon on the last half hour of the contracts

24:30.500 --> 24:36.500
where they went, Yahoo has bought the show with peltz, not with cash.

24:36.500 --> 24:40.500
They use beaver peltz.

24:40.500 --> 24:42.500
Yeah, it was weird that...

24:42.500 --> 24:44.500
And Sony's like, great, we're doing it.

24:44.500 --> 24:50.500
So I bought a house, so I've been doing a lot of stand-up to pay for that.

24:50.500 --> 24:54.500
Seeing my children, I have a 9- and 6-year-old.

24:54.500 --> 24:56.500
Yeah, weird.

24:56.500 --> 25:00.500
That doesn't deserve clapping.

25:00.500 --> 25:02.500
You can actually be a terrible parent for 9 years,

25:02.500 --> 25:04.500
and you'll still have a 9-year-old child.

25:04.500 --> 25:06.500
Thanks, yeah, you're right.

25:06.500 --> 25:08.500
It's been done all over the world.

25:08.500 --> 25:11.500
I have a baby, I just shook it for hours.

25:11.500 --> 25:13.500
I shook it for 9 years.

25:13.500 --> 25:15.500
I was shaking 9-year-old child.

25:15.500 --> 25:18.500
Same results.

25:18.500 --> 25:21.500
But we went to dinner two nights ago, three nights ago.

25:21.500 --> 25:23.500
Yeah, we had terrible octopus.

25:23.500 --> 25:25.500
Terrible octopus, but everything else was terrific.

25:25.500 --> 25:26.500
Yeah, man.

25:26.500 --> 25:30.500
Oh, did you guys hear about the family that ate puffer fish?

25:30.500 --> 25:32.500
Did you hear about this?

25:32.500 --> 25:33.500
It's terrible.

25:33.500 --> 25:36.500
This family had puffer fish,

25:36.500 --> 25:40.500
and you have to train as a chef for two years to serve this stuff.

25:40.500 --> 25:43.500
But it's a very sad story, like their uncle caught it,

25:43.500 --> 25:46.500
and they're disgusting-looking fish,

25:46.500 --> 25:48.500
but the family, someone's like, it looked delicious.

25:48.500 --> 25:51.500
It seemed like it'd be amazing, but they ate it,

25:51.500 --> 25:54.500
and within five minutes, all of them were paralyzed

25:54.500 --> 25:57.500
and having seizures, and they're all in the hospital now.

25:57.500 --> 26:03.500
So octopus, I don't know, made me think of deadly puffer fish.

26:03.500 --> 26:05.500
I went through a day where I was like,

26:05.500 --> 26:08.500
wait a minute, puffer fish, blowfish, what's going on?

26:08.500 --> 26:10.500
What is the thing that I looked into?

26:10.500 --> 26:12.500
It's like puffer fish and blowfish, it's kind of like,

26:12.500 --> 26:14.500
it's all part of the same thing.

26:14.500 --> 26:15.500
I think it's the same.

26:15.500 --> 26:17.500
Yeah, I just remember that Simpsons episode.

26:17.500 --> 26:21.500
Basically, there's like a whole kind of family of fish,

26:21.500 --> 26:24.500
all of whom puff up as a defense mechanism,

26:24.500 --> 26:26.500
and all of whom are deadly poisonous.

26:26.500 --> 26:29.500
And apparently incredibly delicious,

26:29.500 --> 26:31.500
that people keep trying to eat them.

26:31.500 --> 26:34.500
I read a thing where the puffer fish poisoned it.

26:34.500 --> 26:36.500
If you cut the fish correctly,

26:36.500 --> 26:39.500
it just tingles the edge of your lips and your mouth,

26:39.500 --> 26:42.500
and if it's cut right, you swallow it and you're fine.

26:42.500 --> 26:43.500
Oh, who fucking cares?

26:43.500 --> 26:44.500
It doesn't matter.

26:44.500 --> 26:46.500
There's nothing, there's nothing that's,

26:46.500 --> 26:48.500
there's no way there's nothing that's worth that.

26:48.500 --> 26:49.500
There's no way.

26:49.500 --> 26:50.500
Nothing tastes that good.

26:50.500 --> 26:52.500
Nothing tastes that good.

26:52.500 --> 26:55.500
Like the, there's that thing where you eat the,

26:55.500 --> 26:58.500
you eat the partially fertilized bird egg,

26:58.500 --> 27:02.500
the rich people, and then the baby bird bones,

27:02.500 --> 27:05.500
the baby bird bones cut your mouth,

27:05.500 --> 27:08.500
and your own blood is the, is the,

27:08.500 --> 27:10.500
is part of the delicacy.

27:10.500 --> 27:12.500
That is so stupid.

27:12.500 --> 27:15.500
Or like the cat poop coffee,

27:15.500 --> 27:19.500
where the cat or the, some sort of animal eats the coffee beans,

27:19.500 --> 27:21.500
it poops it out, and then that is your coffee.

27:21.500 --> 27:22.500
I've had that.

27:22.500 --> 27:24.500
You've had, you're, see, but you're like,

27:24.500 --> 27:25.500
you're an idiot, right?

27:25.500 --> 27:30.500
For, you, you ate something that's something shit.

27:30.500 --> 27:31.500
Well, and you were like,

27:31.500 --> 27:34.500
You'd be surprised, you'd be surprised.

27:34.500 --> 27:36.500
It's not much of an idiot I am.

27:36.500 --> 27:40.500
No, it, if someone offers you this rare coffee,

27:40.500 --> 27:42.500
even if it's been shit out,

27:42.500 --> 27:44.500
it's, I think it's weasels that eat it actually,

27:44.500 --> 27:46.500
but if someone offers you coffee beans

27:46.500 --> 27:50.500
that have been shit out of rare weasels,

27:50.500 --> 27:53.500
you drink it, Joe, you drink it.

27:53.500 --> 27:56.500
No, that common weasel coffee is this, right?

27:56.500 --> 27:58.500
Rare weasels.

27:58.500 --> 28:00.500
By the way, it just tastes like coffee.

28:00.500 --> 28:03.500
It actually tastes like chicken coffee.

28:03.500 --> 28:05.500
That's it.

28:05.500 --> 28:08.500
I feel like if anyone said this is very rare,

28:08.500 --> 28:11.500
and, and I'm like waiting for the next thing,

28:11.500 --> 28:14.500
and there's like, it was shit out of a weasel,

28:14.500 --> 28:17.500
I would go like, I'm good, I don't need,

28:17.500 --> 28:19.500
you gotta live a little, man.

28:19.500 --> 28:21.500
And I, if Dan will attest,

28:21.500 --> 28:23.500
I'll eat, I'll eat almost anything,

28:23.500 --> 28:26.500
but, but not that, but that's great.

28:26.500 --> 28:28.500
But you have your hipster beer and your friends

28:28.500 --> 28:32.500
and all that, and I can't compete with that.

28:32.500 --> 28:34.500
No, no, infighting in Harmontown.

28:34.500 --> 28:37.500
We're all, we're all, we're all, we're all, what?

28:41.500 --> 28:44.500
You just became the greatest politician of all time.

28:44.500 --> 28:46.500
Because we were infighting, we're like,

28:46.500 --> 28:48.500
what's he gonna say? We're all distracted.

28:52.500 --> 28:54.500
I forgot what we were fighting about.

28:54.500 --> 28:56.500
Drone strike.

28:56.500 --> 28:58.500
Well, you weren't looking.

28:58.500 --> 29:00.500
Drone strikes for everybody.

29:00.500 --> 29:02.500
Have you been watching,

29:02.500 --> 29:05.500
I have been watching The Nick since I,

29:05.500 --> 29:07.500
since the show was picked up.

29:07.500 --> 29:09.500
You've watched The Nick? The Nick?

29:09.500 --> 29:11.500
The Nick on Cinemax, Steven Soderbergh?

29:11.500 --> 29:14.500
No, no, I don't know what that is.

29:14.500 --> 29:16.500
Oh, is that about a guy who,

29:16.500 --> 29:19.500
every morning he cuts himself shaving

29:19.500 --> 29:22.500
and the blood like shows him a crime

29:22.500 --> 29:24.500
that's going to happen?

29:24.500 --> 29:26.500
Amazing.

29:26.500 --> 29:28.500
No.

29:28.500 --> 29:30.500
No.

29:30.500 --> 29:32.500
It's not what it is.

29:32.500 --> 29:34.500
It's about a guy that cuts himself every morning

29:34.500 --> 29:36.500
and his droplet of blood

29:36.500 --> 29:39.500
becomes the newspaper from tomorrow.

29:41.500 --> 29:43.500
Get it straight.

29:44.500 --> 29:46.500
What is The Nick?

29:46.500 --> 29:49.500
Steven Soderbergh directed ten episodes of this,

29:49.500 --> 29:52.500
I guess, miniseries about Clive Owen Starr's

29:52.500 --> 29:55.500
about surgery in 1895.

29:55.500 --> 29:58.500
Very similar to

29:58.500 --> 30:01.500
Community's New Season on Yahoo! Screen.

30:06.500 --> 30:09.500
Yeah, most of Season 6 takes place

30:09.500 --> 30:12.500
at a 19th century

30:12.500 --> 30:14.500
surgery theater place

30:14.500 --> 30:16.500
that people are old men are watching.

30:16.500 --> 30:19.500
Yeah, and it specializes in circus freaks

30:19.500 --> 30:24.500
who don't want to be altered

30:24.500 --> 30:27.500
but who have to be by the government.

30:27.500 --> 30:29.500
I wouldn't watch this show.

30:29.500 --> 30:31.500
It's real time,

30:31.500 --> 30:33.500
because now it's streaming, there's no time slot,

30:33.500 --> 30:35.500
so you can just watch a person

30:35.500 --> 30:38.500
who was born with a unicorn horn

30:38.500 --> 30:40.500
have it removed while they scream,

30:40.500 --> 30:42.500
please don't.

30:42.500 --> 30:46.500
This is the only thing that makes me special.

30:46.500 --> 30:48.500
It's just hacksawed off

30:48.500 --> 30:51.500
by a leather apron freemason.

30:51.500 --> 30:54.500
I would watch that show, I would watch.

30:54.500 --> 30:57.500
It's 59 minutes on average, an episode.

30:57.500 --> 31:00.500
It's available for $1.99 at Yahoo! Screen.

31:00.500 --> 31:02.500
Yahoo! Screen, everyone.

31:02.500 --> 31:06.500
Or try State Leader in screen doors and windows.

31:08.500 --> 31:11.500
Dan, does Kettle ever trick you

31:11.500 --> 31:13.500
and send you flavored vodka?

31:13.500 --> 31:15.500
No, sometimes bartenders do that,

31:15.500 --> 31:17.500
as if I wouldn't notice.

31:17.500 --> 31:20.500
That's the cotton candy vodka everyone's talking about.

31:20.500 --> 31:22.500
Yeah.

31:22.500 --> 31:24.500
Straight to vomit, sir.

31:24.500 --> 31:26.500
But I don't understand about...

31:26.500 --> 31:28.500
Here's one of the 853,000 things

31:28.500 --> 31:30.500
I don't understand about Dan Ackright.

31:34.500 --> 31:36.500
I wish...

31:36.500 --> 31:38.500
He decided to create his own vodka.

31:38.500 --> 31:42.500
He bottles it in a really expensive skull bottle.

31:42.500 --> 31:44.500
It's not that great vodka.

31:44.500 --> 31:47.500
No, it's no purity vodka.

31:47.500 --> 31:51.500
It just seems like it's all bad business.

31:51.500 --> 31:54.500
It seems weird, because growing up,

31:54.500 --> 31:57.500
when you watch Dan Ackright do the Basomatic,

31:57.500 --> 32:00.500
or, I don't know,

32:00.500 --> 32:02.500
Ghostbusters, you're like,

32:02.500 --> 32:06.500
that is a guy that needs to sell me a spirit

32:06.500 --> 32:08.500
in the shape of a skull.

32:08.500 --> 32:11.500
But at no point did you ever think of a skull

32:11.500 --> 32:13.500
when you thought of Dan Ackright?

32:13.500 --> 32:15.500
But he's an alien.

32:15.500 --> 32:17.500
That's like...

32:17.500 --> 32:19.500
He believes that they're aliens

32:19.500 --> 32:22.500
and that the crystal skull is some kind of ancient artifact

32:22.500 --> 32:24.500
that aliens have left around.

32:24.500 --> 32:26.500
He's heavily into that stuff, very much believes in it.

32:26.500 --> 32:29.500
There's a documentary where a neighbor of his

32:29.500 --> 32:32.500
had a camcorder and just shot Dan Ackright

32:32.500 --> 32:35.500
talking about aliens for two hours.

32:35.500 --> 32:37.500
You can watch that.

32:37.500 --> 32:39.500
That doesn't sound boring at all.

32:39.500 --> 32:41.500
I mean, Dan Ackright is...

32:41.500 --> 32:43.500
I think he's officially diagnosed.

32:43.500 --> 32:45.500
I think he's out of the closet,

32:45.500 --> 32:47.500
Asperger's.

32:47.500 --> 32:49.500
Did you know that Asperger's has been struck?

32:49.500 --> 32:51.500
Yeah, it's not a disease anymore.

32:51.500 --> 32:53.500
It's now just a superpower.

32:53.500 --> 32:55.500
The Avengers.

32:55.500 --> 32:57.500
It's not in the diagnostic manual anymore.

32:57.500 --> 32:59.500
They're like, okay, never mind.

32:59.500 --> 33:01.500
It's just different grades of autism.

33:01.500 --> 33:03.500
Right, right, right.

33:03.500 --> 33:06.500
So he's been fully diagnosed.

33:06.500 --> 33:08.500
What we used to call Asperger's,

33:08.500 --> 33:11.500
you can now all go back to calling Dork.

33:11.500 --> 33:13.500
We had a shining moment.

33:13.500 --> 33:16.500
I said, we, like, I'm diagnosing myself.

33:16.500 --> 33:19.500
Dan Ackright, yeah, apparently.

33:19.500 --> 33:21.500
Also Spielberg.

33:21.500 --> 33:23.500
I don't know. I looked it up.

33:23.500 --> 33:25.500
Supposedly Spielberg, also,

33:25.500 --> 33:27.500
an adult diagnosed Asperger's.

33:27.500 --> 33:29.500
I noticed that in Blues Brothers.

33:29.500 --> 33:31.500
Ackright, like this...

33:31.500 --> 33:33.500
The original script for Ghostbusters is like

33:33.500 --> 33:35.500
500,000 pages long.

33:35.500 --> 33:37.500
And it's like...

33:37.500 --> 33:39.500
It's like...

33:39.500 --> 33:41.500
I mean, look it up.

33:41.500 --> 33:43.500
Look online about it.

33:43.500 --> 33:45.500
Like, Ackright's vision of Ghostbusters

33:45.500 --> 33:47.500
minus Ivan Reitman kind of coming in.

33:47.500 --> 33:49.500
I don't know whose to credit.

33:49.500 --> 33:51.500
All good movies are sort of a collaborative,

33:51.500 --> 33:53.500
like, fluke, I think.

33:53.500 --> 33:55.500
There's no...

33:55.500 --> 33:57.500
There's rarely, like, an auteur behind any of it.

33:57.500 --> 33:59.500
It's all sort of like,

33:59.500 --> 34:01.500
because that's why good movies are so rare.

34:01.500 --> 34:03.500
But, like, Ackright's original vision

34:03.500 --> 34:05.500
is like in the form of this gigantic

34:05.500 --> 34:07.500
compendium.

34:07.500 --> 34:09.500
Like, if you watch the Blues Brothers,

34:09.500 --> 34:11.500
like, if you watch the Blues Brothers

34:11.500 --> 34:13.500
behind the scenes stuff, there's...

34:13.500 --> 34:15.500
Like, he had this whole

34:15.500 --> 34:17.500
scene that he had in mind for

34:17.500 --> 34:19.500
Blues Brothers that would explain

34:19.500 --> 34:21.500
why the Blues Mobile was able

34:21.500 --> 34:23.500
to go faster than cop cars.

34:23.500 --> 34:25.500
And it involved, like, the car being parked

34:25.500 --> 34:27.500
between electric pylons overnight.

34:27.500 --> 34:29.500
And it showed, like, electricity zapping

34:29.500 --> 34:31.500
the car.

34:31.500 --> 34:33.500
Like, it's very much...

34:33.500 --> 34:35.500
Like, man, I like Ackright way more

34:35.500 --> 34:37.500
than I thought I did.

34:37.500 --> 34:39.500
And also, like,

34:39.500 --> 34:41.500
he's a way worse writer than I thought he was.

34:41.500 --> 34:43.500
But, like,

34:43.500 --> 34:45.500
yeah, it's like, like, he's sort of...

34:45.500 --> 34:47.500
He's out there.

34:47.500 --> 34:49.500
He loves the aliens and the ghosts and the sci-fi

34:49.500 --> 34:51.500
and, like, really...

34:51.500 --> 34:53.500
I would love to see a 500,000-page

34:53.500 --> 34:55.500
Ghostbusters movie.

34:55.500 --> 34:57.500
It would be like Watership Down,

34:57.500 --> 34:59.500
just this...

34:59.500 --> 35:01.500
I mean, he would be...

35:01.500 --> 35:03.500
That would be a dream guest to have on this show

35:03.500 --> 35:05.500
come and just pop the cork,

35:05.500 --> 35:07.500
let him loose, let him talk about the aliens

35:07.500 --> 35:09.500
and the crystal skulls and stuff.

35:09.500 --> 35:11.500
I didn't think Cattle 1 would feel about it

35:11.500 --> 35:13.500
if he brought up his vodka.

35:13.500 --> 35:15.500
I don't think they're, like, worried about bad PR.

35:17.500 --> 35:19.500
I think maybe if I hit a baby with my car...

35:19.500 --> 35:21.500
With your car?

35:21.500 --> 35:23.500
Or your what? Did you say your cock?

35:23.500 --> 35:25.500
What?

35:25.500 --> 35:27.500
I think if I hit a baby with my cock,

35:27.500 --> 35:29.500
Channel 1

35:29.500 --> 35:31.500
will pull out

35:31.500 --> 35:33.500
if they're marketing agreement.

35:35.500 --> 35:37.500
I agree with that.

35:37.500 --> 35:39.500
I think they'll...

35:39.500 --> 35:41.500
Yeah.

35:41.500 --> 35:43.500
What else is going on?

35:43.500 --> 35:45.500
Dick Cheney's up to his old tricks again.

35:45.500 --> 35:47.500
He is?

35:47.500 --> 35:49.500
How about those Seahawks today?

35:49.500 --> 35:51.500
Seahawks.

35:51.500 --> 35:53.500
Wow.

35:53.500 --> 35:55.500
Football is a sport.

35:57.500 --> 35:59.500
Don't talk down to them.

35:59.500 --> 36:01.500
I literally cannot help

36:01.500 --> 36:03.500
but talk down to them

36:03.500 --> 36:05.500
since I am at a higher elevation than them.

36:05.500 --> 36:07.500
Don't brag about your height.

36:07.500 --> 36:09.500
I'm at a height.

36:09.500 --> 36:11.500
I'm at a stage.

36:11.500 --> 36:13.500
We don't like sports here.

36:13.500 --> 36:15.500
Were you in Houston last night?

36:15.500 --> 36:17.500
I was in Houston, yeah.

36:17.500 --> 36:19.500
How'd it go?

36:19.500 --> 36:21.500
It was alright.

36:21.500 --> 36:23.500
I accidentally called them Austin.

36:25.500 --> 36:27.500
Oh, hell no.

36:27.500 --> 36:29.500
That got us off on the wrong foot.

36:31.500 --> 36:33.500
I love...

36:33.500 --> 36:35.500
I was in Canada,

36:35.500 --> 36:37.500
which is a state just north of here.

36:37.500 --> 36:39.500
No, I was in Canada

36:39.500 --> 36:41.500
and I went to Montreal

36:41.500 --> 36:43.500
and I thought it was a TV special

36:43.500 --> 36:45.500
and I opened it up by saying,

36:45.500 --> 36:47.500
Hello Toronto.

36:47.500 --> 36:49.500
And they were like,

36:49.500 --> 36:51.500
But I just thought,

36:51.500 --> 36:53.500
you're in the same country, assholes.

36:53.500 --> 36:55.500
You hate your own country.

36:55.500 --> 36:57.500
You hate your own city.

36:57.500 --> 36:59.500
Everything about Texas,

36:59.500 --> 37:01.500
I was like, I love Texas.

37:01.500 --> 37:03.500
Texas could be a country if it wanted to be,

37:03.500 --> 37:05.500
but we're going to hate this other city.

37:05.500 --> 37:07.500
Yeah, but Civic Pride is its own brand of pride.

37:07.500 --> 37:09.500
If you go to Milwaukee

37:09.500 --> 37:11.500
and call it Madison,

37:11.500 --> 37:13.500
it's like, what you're saying is,

37:13.500 --> 37:15.500
I'm a rich asshole who got dropped in by a helicopter.

37:15.500 --> 37:17.500
I don't know where the fuck I am.

37:17.500 --> 37:19.500
That's what they're doing.

37:19.500 --> 37:21.500
I see.

37:21.500 --> 37:23.500
It was totally true.

37:23.500 --> 37:25.500
I was living three hours from Austin to Houston

37:25.500 --> 37:27.500
and was so proud of myself.

37:27.500 --> 37:29.500
I was like, listen,

37:29.500 --> 37:31.500
it's great to be at the Alamo Draft House.

37:31.500 --> 37:33.500
They have Alamo Draft Houses everywhere in fucking Texas.

37:33.500 --> 37:35.500
So it's like,

37:35.500 --> 37:37.500
I was like, look,

37:37.500 --> 37:39.500
all I see is awesome nerds and hipsters

37:39.500 --> 37:41.500
that love cinema

37:41.500 --> 37:43.500
and Quentin Tarantino posters.

37:43.500 --> 37:45.500
I kind of did think I was in Austin.

37:45.500 --> 37:47.500
I forgot I was just there

37:47.500 --> 37:49.500
three hours earlier.

37:49.500 --> 37:51.500
I was like, yeah, man, it's great.

37:51.500 --> 37:53.500
It's a theater. It's great to be here in Austin

37:53.500 --> 37:55.500
and all this stuff.

37:55.500 --> 37:57.500
It was so sad. They didn't like boo me.

37:57.500 --> 37:59.500
They're not like, kill them.

37:59.500 --> 38:01.500
No, you could just see them be like,

38:01.500 --> 38:03.500
and then they came up to me at the intermission.

38:03.500 --> 38:05.500
They were like, look, we're from Houston.

38:05.500 --> 38:07.500
It's worse things could happen

38:07.500 --> 38:09.500
than to be mistaken for Austin.

38:09.500 --> 38:11.500
They're very nice people.

38:11.500 --> 38:13.500
They're the Milwaukee of Texas.

38:13.500 --> 38:15.500
Did you see the

38:15.500 --> 38:17.500
Reddit article about the Illuminati Room

38:17.500 --> 38:19.500
in this Houston hotel?

38:19.500 --> 38:21.500
No, I have a life.

38:21.500 --> 38:23.500
He's great.

38:23.500 --> 38:25.500
I don't know why Joel McKell hates me,

38:25.500 --> 38:27.500
but it's kind of about that.

38:27.500 --> 38:29.500
It's incredible.

38:29.500 --> 38:31.500
You have no other job

38:31.500 --> 38:33.500
other than to receive my horrible insults.

38:33.500 --> 38:35.500
I feel honored and honored.

38:35.500 --> 38:37.500
The people behind that mirror are way worse than you.

38:37.500 --> 38:39.500
Look at them. I think you might be in the Illuminati, friend.

38:39.500 --> 38:41.500
I am, my friend.

38:41.500 --> 38:43.500
You better cut your hair, hippie.

38:43.500 --> 38:45.500
I was about to say,

38:45.500 --> 38:47.500
if you want to be a part of us someday.

38:47.500 --> 38:49.500
You can get a reptilian haircut.

38:49.500 --> 38:51.500
If I was a reptilian, that's exactly how I cut my hair.

38:51.500 --> 38:53.500
It only comes out when the sun shines.

38:53.500 --> 38:55.500
Wow.

38:55.500 --> 38:57.500
Wait, what was the Reddit thing?

38:57.500 --> 38:59.500
Somebody went to this hotel in Houston

38:59.500 --> 39:01.500
and they gave them this room

39:01.500 --> 39:03.500
that had an obvious two-way mirror

39:03.500 --> 39:05.500
built into the wall.

39:05.500 --> 39:07.500
It was a mirror in the wall

39:07.500 --> 39:09.500
and all these really creepy

39:09.500 --> 39:11.500
pictures that wouldn't be in a hotel room.

39:11.500 --> 39:13.500
All these spooky pictures.

39:13.500 --> 39:15.500
The floor was concrete.

39:15.500 --> 39:17.500
There was a lot of stains on it.

39:17.500 --> 39:19.500
The guy started taking pictures

39:19.500 --> 39:21.500
and immediately posting them on Reddit.

39:21.500 --> 39:23.500
Thank God.

39:23.500 --> 39:25.500
And then the hotel called and said,

39:25.500 --> 39:27.500
we gave you the wrong room

39:27.500 --> 39:29.500
and moved them to a different room.

39:29.500 --> 39:31.500
Yeah, look it up.

39:31.500 --> 39:33.500
It's amazing.

39:33.500 --> 39:35.500
And then after it went up on Reddit

39:35.500 --> 39:37.500
and went viral, the hotel was like,

39:37.500 --> 39:39.500
that's just a theme room that we have.

39:39.500 --> 39:41.500
It's a theme room.

39:41.500 --> 39:43.500
It's the Austin theme room.

39:43.500 --> 39:45.500
Convicted of a lot of

39:45.500 --> 39:47.500
white-collar crime,

39:47.500 --> 39:49.500
some kind of oil man

39:49.500 --> 39:51.500
who'd gotten in a lot of trouble.

39:51.500 --> 39:53.500
It shouldn't have been a hotel room.

39:53.500 --> 39:55.500
It was like...

39:55.500 --> 39:57.500
What a weird fetish to get off on.

39:57.500 --> 39:59.500
Oh, that dude,

39:59.500 --> 40:01.500
that white-collar criminal.

40:01.500 --> 40:03.500
Oh, man.

40:03.500 --> 40:05.500
But the number of the room,

40:05.500 --> 40:07.500
I can't remember the number of the room,

40:07.500 --> 40:09.500
but it was somehow connected to the skull and bones.

40:09.500 --> 40:11.500
People were saying,

40:11.500 --> 40:13.500
there was an Illuminati kill room

40:13.500 --> 40:15.500
where people who want to strangle a hooker

40:15.500 --> 40:17.500
or stab someone to death

40:17.500 --> 40:19.500
pay a lot for the room.

40:19.500 --> 40:21.500
And so, there was Houston.

40:21.500 --> 40:23.500
That can't be.

40:23.500 --> 40:25.500
That cannot be.

40:25.500 --> 40:27.500
You told me at one point,

40:27.500 --> 40:29.500
you told me about

40:29.500 --> 40:31.500
there was the first cybernetic hate crime

40:31.500 --> 40:33.500
happened in Paris where a guy

40:33.500 --> 40:35.500
was a cyborg and they

40:35.500 --> 40:37.500
tried to rip his neck out.

40:37.500 --> 40:39.500
But it was just a guy who had chosen to bolt

40:39.500 --> 40:41.500
his ear.

40:41.500 --> 40:43.500
And it was like three years earlier.

40:43.500 --> 40:45.500
That guy had that drilled into his face.

40:45.500 --> 40:47.500
I tried to get it.

40:47.500 --> 40:49.500
I was actually trying to write this article for Vice

40:49.500 --> 40:51.500
and I wanted to interview that guy

40:51.500 --> 40:53.500
about what happened.

40:53.500 --> 40:55.500
But it was actually drilled into the bone of his face.

40:55.500 --> 40:57.500
He didn't have it on his ear.

40:57.500 --> 40:59.500
It was in his head. Maybe it was on his ear.

40:59.500 --> 41:01.500
Was the name of the article,

41:01.500 --> 41:03.500
hey, I met an idiot?

41:03.500 --> 41:05.500
I don't know what that means.

41:05.500 --> 41:07.500
You don't know what that means?

41:07.500 --> 41:09.500
He drilled into his head.

41:09.500 --> 41:11.500
Oh, the cyborg.

41:11.500 --> 41:13.500
I was still reeling from when

41:13.500 --> 41:15.500
you called me an idiot earlier.

41:15.500 --> 41:17.500
Is this like another

41:17.500 --> 41:19.500
Mikhail Jaffe?

41:19.500 --> 41:21.500
I have a responsibility here

41:21.500 --> 41:23.500
to explain.

41:23.500 --> 41:25.500
You guys have a kind of antithetical

41:25.500 --> 41:27.500
style.

41:27.500 --> 41:29.500
Joel's

41:29.500 --> 41:31.500
as a biological...

41:31.500 --> 41:33.500
I'm a

41:33.500 --> 41:35.500
velociraptor.

41:35.500 --> 41:37.500
Joel...

41:41.500 --> 41:43.500
Joel is a great, very hardworking,

41:43.500 --> 41:45.500
very charming, very sexually appealing

41:45.500 --> 41:47.500
man with a giant chest

41:47.500 --> 41:49.500
and arms the size

41:49.500 --> 41:51.500
of my head.

41:51.500 --> 41:53.500
But he only,

41:53.500 --> 41:55.500
comedically, all he knows is

41:55.500 --> 41:57.500
making fun of your clothes or your...

41:57.500 --> 41:59.500
He just kind of like...

41:59.500 --> 42:01.500
His instinct is,

42:01.500 --> 42:03.500
you're like, hey, what's up with your teeth?

42:03.500 --> 42:05.500
Fuck you, fuck face.

42:05.500 --> 42:07.500
I can't help it.

42:07.500 --> 42:09.500
I can't help it.

42:09.500 --> 42:11.500
Imagine how they feel.

42:11.500 --> 42:13.500
He hosts

42:13.500 --> 42:15.500
the suit.

42:15.500 --> 42:17.500
Look, I've got elves living in my home.

42:17.500 --> 42:19.500
Kids wake up.

42:19.500 --> 42:21.500
Joel Mikhail was auditioning for

42:21.500 --> 42:23.500
the role of Jeff Winger.

42:23.500 --> 42:25.500
We were going through the folly,

42:25.500 --> 42:27.500
the formality of testing him against

42:27.500 --> 42:29.500
other actors.

42:29.500 --> 42:31.500
Joel comes into the room

42:31.500 --> 42:33.500
and there's like 30 people in the room,

42:33.500 --> 42:35.500
but they're all executives from Sony

42:35.500 --> 42:37.500
and NBC. And Joel just went around

42:37.500 --> 42:39.500
the room and

42:39.500 --> 42:41.500
ridiculed every...

42:41.500 --> 42:43.500
I love that.

42:43.500 --> 42:45.500
I just pointed at every...

42:45.500 --> 42:47.500
You had a

42:47.500 --> 42:49.500
fair-monal ability to zero in on the

42:49.500 --> 42:51.500
highest-ranking people.

42:51.500 --> 42:53.500
And I was like, hey, good to see

42:53.500 --> 42:55.500
Frank Stallone's here. That was the head of Sony.

42:57.500 --> 42:59.500
Hey, would it kill you to wear a tie?

42:59.500 --> 43:01.500
That was the head of NBC.

43:01.500 --> 43:03.500
They just worked the room.

43:03.500 --> 43:05.500
It was great. It was funny.

43:05.500 --> 43:07.500
That's Joel's style.

43:07.500 --> 43:09.500
Because I'm crying inside.

43:09.500 --> 43:11.500
You can't let it get to you, Duncan Tressel.

43:11.500 --> 43:13.500
I love it. It's amazing.

43:13.500 --> 43:15.500
I'm honestly flattered by it.

43:15.500 --> 43:17.500
I think it's fucking cool.

43:17.500 --> 43:19.500
I like it. You're a sweetie, Joel Mikhail.

43:19.500 --> 43:21.500
I can feel the love inside of you

43:21.500 --> 43:23.500
radiating out.

43:23.500 --> 43:25.500
Not love, but...

43:25.500 --> 43:27.500
It's the only way I know how to behave.

43:27.500 --> 43:29.500
I want to be like that.

43:29.500 --> 43:31.500
I'm terrified.

43:31.500 --> 43:33.500
I could never pull that off.

43:33.500 --> 43:35.500
I always wish I was more mean.

43:35.500 --> 43:37.500
I would like to be...

43:37.500 --> 43:39.500
We can start right now. I can teach you.

43:39.500 --> 43:41.500
This seems worthwhile.

43:41.500 --> 43:43.500
Let's teach Duncan Tressel

43:43.500 --> 43:45.500
how to be mean.

43:45.500 --> 43:47.500
Let's do it.

43:47.500 --> 43:49.500
Pick someone from the audience.

43:49.500 --> 43:51.500
I can't do that, man.

43:51.500 --> 43:53.500
I'm not doing that.

43:53.500 --> 43:55.500
That's what you have to start with.

43:55.500 --> 43:57.500
You start with an innocence.

43:59.500 --> 44:01.500
The Illuminati.

44:01.500 --> 44:03.500
That's the only way it will work.

44:03.500 --> 44:05.500
Is there anyone in the audience who feels like...

44:05.500 --> 44:07.500
Him, father, him.

44:07.500 --> 44:09.500
Come on up here, genius.

44:11.500 --> 44:13.500
Don't sit so close to me.

44:17.500 --> 44:19.500
Don't sit so close to me.

44:19.500 --> 44:21.500
You're learning, Jedi.

44:21.500 --> 44:23.500
Great.

44:23.500 --> 44:25.500
Take one, yeah.

44:25.500 --> 44:27.500
Go ahead.

44:27.500 --> 44:29.500
Ask him a question.

44:29.500 --> 44:31.500
Are you enjoying the show so far?

44:31.500 --> 44:33.500
Now wait.

44:33.500 --> 44:35.500
Whatever his answer is,

44:35.500 --> 44:37.500
it's wrong.

44:39.500 --> 44:41.500
You're doing great so far.

44:41.500 --> 44:43.500
It's good.

44:43.500 --> 44:45.500
I'm enjoying myself.

44:45.500 --> 44:47.500
The show fucking sucks.

44:47.500 --> 44:49.500
Are you an idiot?

44:49.500 --> 44:51.500
Good.

44:51.500 --> 44:53.500
How could you make me feel good?

44:53.500 --> 44:55.500
How could you feel good?

44:55.500 --> 44:57.500
You're wearing all black.

44:57.500 --> 44:59.500
What are you, a fucking asshole?

44:59.500 --> 45:01.500
Nice.

45:01.500 --> 45:03.500
Nice.

45:03.500 --> 45:05.500
I'm sorry.

45:05.500 --> 45:07.500
This guy's amazing.

45:07.500 --> 45:09.500
Don't apologize.

45:09.500 --> 45:11.500
Don't apologize, you idiot.

45:11.500 --> 45:13.500
Luke Skywalker didn't shoot a laser

45:13.500 --> 45:15.500
into the Death Star and then pull it back.

45:15.500 --> 45:17.500
Oh, no.

45:17.500 --> 45:19.500
Use the force, you fucking prick.

45:19.500 --> 45:21.500
Ask him his name.

45:21.500 --> 45:23.500
What's your name?

45:23.500 --> 45:25.500
Ethan.

45:25.500 --> 45:27.500
Ethan!

45:27.500 --> 45:29.500
Okay.

45:29.500 --> 45:31.500
Think of another person named Ethan

45:31.500 --> 45:33.500
that you don't like.

45:33.500 --> 45:35.500
Ethan Allen.

45:35.500 --> 45:37.500
Shit, he ferned.

45:37.500 --> 45:39.500
What do they sell?

45:39.500 --> 45:41.500
Furniture?

45:41.500 --> 45:43.500
Ask him why his facial hair doesn't match

45:43.500 --> 45:45.500
his head hair at all.

45:45.500 --> 45:47.500
I know you're just feeding him.

45:47.500 --> 45:49.500
Yeah.

45:49.500 --> 45:51.500
All right, that's all I got.

45:51.500 --> 45:53.500
You have to come up with a question for him.

45:53.500 --> 45:55.500
So, um...

45:55.500 --> 45:57.500
How long have you been the biggest asshole

45:57.500 --> 45:59.500
of the show?

45:59.500 --> 46:01.500
I didn't...

46:01.500 --> 46:03.500
I'm so sorry.

46:03.500 --> 46:05.500
I'm so sorry.

46:05.500 --> 46:07.500
I would never say anything like that.

46:07.500 --> 46:09.500
That is horrible.

46:09.500 --> 46:11.500
Is he teaching you or are you teaching him?

46:11.500 --> 46:13.500
It doesn't matter.

46:13.500 --> 46:15.500
The master...

46:15.500 --> 46:17.500
All right, thank you.

46:17.500 --> 46:19.500
Vincent van Gogh, ladies and gentlemen.

46:19.500 --> 46:21.500
Thank you.

46:21.500 --> 46:23.500
Thank you.

46:23.500 --> 46:25.500
Thank you.

46:25.500 --> 46:27.500
He did look a little bit like Vincent van Gogh.

46:27.500 --> 46:29.500
See?

46:29.500 --> 46:31.500
There's glimmers of genius in it.

46:31.500 --> 46:33.500
He looked like Vincent van Gogh.

46:33.500 --> 46:35.500
Uh...

46:35.500 --> 46:37.500
I can't wait to see how this newfound power

46:37.500 --> 46:39.500
and exchange will affect our meeting

46:39.500 --> 46:41.500
with Spencer Crittenden.

46:41.500 --> 46:43.500
Let's make it up!

46:43.500 --> 46:45.500
Let's make it up!

46:45.500 --> 46:47.500
Let's make it up!

46:47.500 --> 46:49.500
Let's make it up!

46:49.500 --> 46:51.500
Let's make it up!

46:51.500 --> 46:53.500
Hey! Hey!

46:53.500 --> 46:55.500
What's up?

46:55.500 --> 46:57.500
Everybody!

46:57.500 --> 46:59.500
All right. All right.

46:59.500 --> 47:01.500
That's a bit much.

47:01.500 --> 47:03.500
I think they're doing it because you're still clapping.

47:03.500 --> 47:05.500
He's still clapping.

47:05.500 --> 47:07.500
Good to see you. Hey, guys.

47:07.500 --> 47:09.500
Good to see you, Spencer.

47:09.500 --> 47:11.500
Man, last night I was starving

47:11.500 --> 47:14.220
It was like three in the morning and I was trapped in a hotel and

47:15.940 --> 47:22.540
Was there a Texas billionaires picture for boiled down there was certainly a buyers club involved

47:23.660 --> 47:28.260
No, I was really at rock bottom. I was starving. I couldn't I was too hungry to get to sleep

47:28.260 --> 47:33.660
So I was uh, I was reduced to eating the apple I used as a pipe in the hotel

47:33.660 --> 47:41.180
That's the original Thanksgiving, isn't it?

47:45.660 --> 47:49.920
It was it was delicious though. No, it wasn't it was a green apple. Those are the worst

47:51.220 --> 47:54.100
Was it was a man Apple enthusiasts

47:55.140 --> 48:03.180
You just got booed for saying green apples. Okay. What's the worst the red red delicious or those Washington red are worse than green apples

48:03.180 --> 48:06.120
But other than that you I'm from Washington. It's a

48:06.740 --> 48:13.560
Well, I don't think Washington ruined their apples. I think other people intervened. I agree. I retract

48:14.820 --> 48:20.820
But I'm curious what was gross about the was it that it was a green apple or was it that was it its use of a

48:20.820 --> 48:24.340
As a pipe that made it. No, that made it great. Oh, okay

48:24.740 --> 48:30.480
That's what I was curious about. No, I couldn't I couldn't tell you you would never tell someone smoked out of it other than the

48:30.480 --> 48:33.440
The the blackened charred holes in the science

48:34.640 --> 48:39.640
But no, it was it was a green apples are gross and they have thick skin. I hate apples. I think

48:41.480 --> 48:44.200
Oranges are better if I were to have to compare the two

48:46.240 --> 48:51.240
Yeah, but an orange pie an orange pipe doesn't seem like it would well you'd be surprised

48:51.240 --> 48:57.440
But when we were in San Francisco, I I did not have access to an apple. So I hit up a 7-eleven and got other fruits

48:57.440 --> 49:02.120
Namely a banana and a lime and a lime worked a lot better

49:02.120 --> 49:09.080
Why don't you buy some rolling papers? I my hands get too sweaty and it literally disintegrates the the paper as I roll it

49:09.080 --> 49:11.380
And then I just have a pants full of weed

49:17.840 --> 49:22.960
God damn it. No, I forgot what I was gonna ask. Oh, sorry. No, it's not your fault. I feel like it was

49:22.960 --> 49:27.520
Uh, no, hey, that's cuz your brain dead you shithead. There we go

49:27.520 --> 49:37.520
Oh, that's how you do it. Thank you.

49:43.440 --> 49:45.440
Dunk and triple everyone

49:45.440 --> 50:00.280
I hope we can hit the reset button on Duncan after this show is done

50:01.280 --> 50:04.640
Because I love let's bring up Vincent Gallo again. Let's see what he has

50:07.040 --> 50:09.480
Sorry, I want to plug something real quick

50:09.480 --> 50:15.600
I think the next episode that airs of Brooklyn Nine-Nine unless they added me out. I'm in

50:21.360 --> 50:25.240
They probably did edit me out because I can't act so, you know

50:26.520 --> 50:30.200
Pretty good job in community. Hey, I don't need any of that. No, I really

50:31.160 --> 50:36.800
It just makes me feel like you did a shitty job in community. Thank you. Thank you. You did great

50:36.800 --> 50:45.360
I appreciate it. You're wait. You're a professional actor. So you'd know I would know if you sucked. Yeah, holy shit

50:45.360 --> 50:47.360
I guess I can do it

50:49.840 --> 50:54.920
It's I mean you just got when a bunch of when a bunch of rabble like these is into you

50:54.920 --> 50:58.320
It's just like oh, it's just a bunch of people that are wrong about stuff

51:00.160 --> 51:04.360
Yeah, but I really want to know about that Illuminati hotel room like

51:04.360 --> 51:06.360
I

51:06.400 --> 51:12.000
Google search. I mean, yeah, somebody you guys are always yelling at yelling stuff out somebody

51:12.440 --> 51:14.840
Get on your get on your Google Tori spelling

51:15.800 --> 51:18.960

Yeah, are the are the photos posted as well. Yeah, why don't you bring it bring it?

51:27.640 --> 51:34.760
Are you willing to bring it up here? We won't we won't mock you. Well, I guess

Cereal this is like cereal Ben's got a chain glorious bastards t-shirt on yeah

51:49.080 --> 51:53.560
So if we alienate him we've lost one-fifth of our audience for the six season

51:53.560 --> 51:58.520
All right, so it's a discoveries. Oh making that is really weird

51:59.600 --> 52:04.380
It's way weird, and I thought it would be yeah, these are actual photos from the hotel room. Yeah

52:05.080 --> 52:09.280
It's a podcast all enough. It's gonna translate very well. I think they can get the whole thing

52:09.280 --> 52:13.800
You gotta be it's gonna be like a whole right that would be all I know you've been while you're looking at the photos

52:13.800 --> 52:18.640
I can describe those so Ben. Yeah judging from your haircuts

52:18.640 --> 52:23.520
There's no way I'll let actually I'll let Duncan take a swing

52:24.200 --> 52:32.000

You can be nice. Thank you helps people get books. That's good. This is all a setup. Come on

52:58.960 --> 53:01.200
Then how old are you 29?

53:06.400 --> 53:11.680
All right, I wasn't paying to tell you look at other pictures very about that look it's pretty creepy. They're out there man

53:11.680 --> 53:18.200
Do you make this idea Spencer? Do you think which idea well this idea that the guy got checked into a hotel or that turned out to

53:18.360 --> 53:24.320
Accidentally be an Illuminati hotel and he posted about it on reddit, right? Then he's wrong. He's a fucking idiot

53:25.240 --> 53:27.240
Why because he's on reddit

53:27.240 --> 53:30.440
Oh, hell no, right? That's fine

53:38.920 --> 53:40.200
Gannica

53:40.200 --> 53:43.120
Well the skull and bar I mean the skull and bones is a real thing

53:43.120 --> 53:48.200
That's a real secret fraternity that a lot of powerful people have been in and I heard that you know

53:48.200 --> 53:49.240
There was a movie about it

53:49.240 --> 53:55.880
I didn't see that but I heard you have to lay in a glass coffin and people jerk off on top of the coffin

53:55.880 --> 54:01.240
Oh, well that sounds true. That's the least severe hazing. I've ever heard

54:02.400 --> 54:07.640
Because they put naked people in freezing water and shit. You just get not jizzed on I

54:11.520 --> 54:14.800
Mean even getting jizzed on doesn't seem as bad as most stuff

54:14.800 --> 54:22.840
I would not want to be laying in a glass coffin looking up at a young George W. Bush spraying jizz onto the top of my

54:22.840 --> 54:26.000
Wait a minute. Well, that's where you and I differ. You're you're gonna I

54:27.040 --> 54:35.040
Thought but what if I told you that that in our society ultra rich people get the privilege of getting to sit in a

54:35.240 --> 54:41.280
Protected chamber while everyone around them is forced to humiliate themselves by jerking off

54:42.440 --> 54:49.500
To around them and they get to look at their dicks and see them while they're coming without ever being touched by their come

54:49.500 --> 54:53.500
Yeah, it's it's truly living the dream

54:54.740 --> 54:58.540
Wait, I have a question. Yeah, I the fuck is Ben still up here

55:01.380 --> 55:07.220

55:08.100 --> 55:11.340
From the beat, you know brief moment. I looked at this. Yeah, sure

55:11.340 --> 55:27.500
Okay, there you go. All right, let's have a hand for Ben. All right, what have we learned tonight?

55:27.500 --> 55:30.900
I want I want handicapped people to write more scripts. Hey

55:32.380 --> 55:34.380
Joel's mean

55:34.380 --> 55:41.540
The Illuminati is real and there I've taught Duncan how to be mean Duncan is now mean

55:48.980 --> 55:52.900
And works at a library we work we figured that out and Ben has a phone

55:54.540 --> 55:56.540
That guy looks like Vincent van Gogh

55:57.460 --> 56:02.820
Spencer, he's a he's a skilled artist. Don't complain man. He's a great artist

56:02.820 --> 56:07.700
Yeah, I wish I was Vincent van Gogh. Yeah, I

56:08.980 --> 56:14.260
Don't know your art. I mean it might be great. I'm not gonna deny it could be sorry audience

56:14.940 --> 56:17.980
I'm wondering what to do with all these episodes because we went to San Francisco

56:18.900 --> 56:22.340
Austin and Houston. What if we aired so far Dustin because we got a

56:24.820 --> 56:27.260
Okay, we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna air stuff every two days

56:27.260 --> 56:34.540
So like you guys got to hear the LeVar Burton episode in Austin? That guy I

56:35.420 --> 56:38.100
Don't know how much his projection. I mean cuz he's

56:38.500 --> 56:42.380
Yeah, he's perhaps the most positive person in the history of the world

56:42.380 --> 56:44.820
He makes you he makes your knees shake a little bit

56:44.820 --> 56:51.060
You can project a lot of stuff out of that guy if you want to and he killed Troy in the lost episodes of the community, right?

56:51.340 --> 56:53.340
You're not ate him on a boat. You're not

56:53.820 --> 56:55.820

The season six entirely flashback episode and then the Dean sends it down syndrome person to tell us the bad news

57:09.260 --> 57:12.900
Then what are you gonna do in between now and the time we start shooting?

57:15.140 --> 57:17.620
I'm writing. What are you talking about? I don't know

57:17.620 --> 57:29.820

59:08.300 --> 59:11.060
I said, yeah, it's not a pool of livers

59:11.060 --> 59:19.780
I would agree that but the liver has done great things for all of us on stage

59:20.620 --> 59:26.300
It is the giver of life to all of us. Yeah, I feel like I need to bathe in a liver pool

59:27.540 --> 59:29.540
If I'm gonna keep going oh

Not enough people can sit on them because there's a fucking Paul McCartney like bronze public

01:00:09.980 --> 01:00:14.460
Sometimes you go to in American cities, you'll be in like Spokane, Washington

01:00:55.100 --> 01:00:57.100
Wow, that's pretty good

01:00:58.220 --> 01:01:03.700
Well, Elvis Costello and I want to sing but a place called the other pool

01:01:03.700 --> 01:01:10.180
I wanna play guitar and be a Costello cuz my name is Elvis Costello

01:01:10.180 --> 01:01:33.180
He just ran Costello with Costello

01:01:40.180 --> 01:01:42.180
I

01:01:51.740 --> 01:01:54.460
Got a question for everybody sitting up here

01:01:55.060 --> 01:02:00.060
So like if you were walking into a public restroom, right and on the bathroom counter

01:02:00.900 --> 01:02:02.900
Is a tray of cupcakes?

01:02:04.740 --> 01:02:06.740
Would you eat the cupcakes

01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:14.500
Let's start with Danielle. Yes, you would eat cupcakes off a bathroom counter. I thought so

01:02:15.900 --> 01:02:17.900
I would too for the record, you know

01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:20.500
Duncan

01:02:20.500 --> 01:02:22.500
Are they gluten-free?

01:02:23.100 --> 01:02:26.340
Yeah, yeah, they are then I'll eat them. Okay, I

01:02:27.420 --> 01:02:30.380
Mean Joel hasn't eaten a cupcake since 1982

01:02:30.380 --> 01:02:40.180
A and B like I would be in a public fucking bath. Joel hasn't been in a public bathroom

01:02:43.460 --> 01:02:46.180
The last time you peed is it Rupert Murdoch?

01:02:47.980 --> 01:02:49.980
Teleported you to the moon

01:02:49.980 --> 01:02:56.380
Say you're on Mars and a Pegasus walks up and begins and offers you a cigar. Would you take it?

01:02:56.380 --> 01:03:02.060
You you're you're able to you're you're the same age as me you you work as hard as me

01:03:02.220 --> 01:03:05.740
You're very much more handsome than me, but you're an actor

01:03:05.740 --> 01:03:09.300
I'm a writer, but you you hobnob with the

01:03:09.940 --> 01:03:15.860
The fact that I got my job back is because you're a more politically facile man than I am

01:03:15.860 --> 01:03:19.060
You are friends with the people that I hate

01:03:19.060 --> 01:03:26.620
Like I mean and you you're you're I'm so curious about that like you you go on their yachts you go golfing with them like

01:03:26.700 --> 01:03:28.900
That makes me feel like a dude on their yachts

01:03:29.900 --> 01:03:31.900
That's how big their yachts are

01:03:32.460 --> 01:03:37.820
You're like a networker. You know how to you know how to do it. You're a charmer. You're a diplomat. You're Jeff winger

01:03:37.820 --> 01:03:40.260
How do you think I got Daniel up here tonight? I?

01:03:41.820 --> 01:03:46.620
Mean, how do you how do you keep the bile down? Oh your stomach when you're talking to?

01:03:46.620 --> 01:03:50.180
a captain of industry because the bile tastes like champagne my friend

01:03:53.740 --> 01:03:56.180
Excuse me rose champagne

01:03:57.540 --> 01:03:59.540
Damn, there was no other option

01:03:59.700 --> 01:04:06.780
To the to not have you back would have been much like a samurai or like a Japanese general in World War 2

01:04:06.780 --> 01:04:08.780
It was either victory or suicide

01:04:10.180 --> 01:04:13.580
You can look up your history because that's what they would do if they didn't win the battle

01:04:13.580 --> 01:04:17.220
They would kill themselves. Did you did you have to do shameful things to get me back?

01:04:18.500 --> 01:04:20.500
Not in my mind, but a lot of real

01:04:22.940 --> 01:04:24.940
You laid in the glass coffin

01:04:27.020 --> 01:04:29.020
Without the lid

01:04:30.380 --> 01:04:32.380
Open casket

01:04:33.540 --> 01:04:36.220
And I was the one who removed the lid

01:04:36.220 --> 01:04:38.220
I

01:04:43.220 --> 01:04:45.220
See you come

01:04:56.860 --> 01:05:01.900
If you were the recording mixer be like Elvis Costello has a horrible infection

01:05:01.900 --> 01:05:05.700
And he meets his son is this need to be cleared out

01:05:07.620 --> 01:05:09.620
What's going on

01:05:09.620 --> 01:05:32.620
I just proved it right. Did you say drapes and windows? Yeah, ever heard of them?

01:05:32.620 --> 01:05:41.740
No, it's called Feng Shui, baby. No, no my assistant installed them. So I don't know what they are

01:05:48.220 --> 01:05:53.340
Sorry Daniel, are you offended by this? Okay. I'll see your Elvis Costello impression

01:05:54.300 --> 01:05:56.300
Okay

01:05:56.540 --> 01:05:58.300

Go on a husband Duncan will propose to you tonight

01:06:14.220 --> 01:06:16.220
Will you marry me?

01:06:17.300 --> 01:06:19.300
Don't

01:06:19.300 --> 01:06:24.620
Are you kidding me? She made the right choice. That's what she wants is to reject someone tonight. Maybe that's

01:06:24.620 --> 01:06:26.620
Part of

Yeah, well you could afford to take this trip. It's not you didn't you didn't like break the bank doing it, right?

01:06:39.180 --> 01:06:42.620
It wasn't it was quite expensive, but it was like how much was the plane ticket

That's like three quid Joe Mikhail is gonna reimburse you tonight, and that's why

01:06:50.940 --> 01:07:01.900

And he brought British money

01:07:58.140 --> 01:08:03.420
Joe Mikhail just just just pressed a wad of good old

01:08:04.140 --> 01:08:06.140
green ass

01:08:06.140 --> 01:08:13.380
Kentucky back to Uncle Sam Skrilla I had to go in there to pull out of my butt

01:08:14.700 --> 01:08:17.740
Into the Imperial Palm of this Royal

01:08:19.060 --> 01:08:23.220
Layabout yeah, because that's what the British need more money

That's America give it that's you you go back and you tell Elizabeth. We said what's up. Yeah, you

01:08:35.180 --> 01:08:38.340
Listen you listen you listen

Could you believe the colonnade and all the 50 states and all the pay the banners and the stripes and all the Marines and

01:08:48.180 --> 01:08:53.820
Dronestrikes and Veronica

01:08:59.180 --> 01:09:01.660
You said marines and garlic

01:09:03.420 --> 01:09:05.260
Marines and garlic and ground

01:09:05.260 --> 01:09:09.700
Strike you've been for in an anti-vaccine. I had the drone

01:09:12.780 --> 01:09:14.780
She's counting it she's counting it now

01:09:14.780 --> 01:09:16.780
I

01:09:16.780 --> 01:09:19.380
Through it that's called the glass gal thumb through

01:09:20.900 --> 01:09:24.100
How dare you she can make out something about the Scottish

01:09:26.340 --> 01:09:33.580
All right, well unsolicited but now definitely a fantasy come true my god. Tell us we're good people you don't have to

01:09:35.020 --> 01:09:40.540
All right, well the only thing the only thing left that could possibly make you feel better as if you played judges and dragons with us, right?

01:09:40.540 --> 01:09:42.540
Yeah

01:09:47.980 --> 01:09:52.060
I'm sure Joel will be will be a wonderful D&D player. I

01:09:54.940 --> 01:09:56.940
Cannot wait

01:09:58.060 --> 01:10:00.060
Is that do we need more?

01:10:00.060 --> 01:10:03.220
I played a lot of top secret growing up, but not as much time

01:10:03.740 --> 01:10:06.100
That's you know impressive in its own right

01:10:06.100 --> 01:10:11.500
So I still have my original top secret box at home with all my characters in it

01:10:12.580 --> 01:10:17.220
That's really cool. It's like I'm really turned on right now. Yeah

01:10:18.060 --> 01:10:20.060
Good thing you're sitting down

01:10:20.420 --> 01:10:24.780
And if you have as much hair on your head and face as you do around your dick, it's gonna be hard to see

Feel like you've just memorized a lot of words

01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:15.040
To lure me into your cab this is gray Hawk coming down from the 10 to the 5

01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:23.280
I should when when I was playing D&D with my high school friends this guy

01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:29.520
You know like that movie the fly this guy got trapped in a teleporter with a bag of holding and each which version of the fly

01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:31.520
I don't know. I never saw it

01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:35.520
The one where they get fused, you know fused together

01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:41.240
Right the fly in the person. I'm glad to rail this story. No regret it

01:13:41.240 --> 01:13:47.000
It's important to clarify the gold bloom version. Yeah, well again. I never saw it. I heard that in the audience

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:54.840
Yeah, so yeah, yeah, yeah, he fused with the bag of holding and then so he gained the ability to like store up to you

01:13:54.840 --> 01:13:57.040
Know 50 cubic feet in his asshole

01:13:58.520 --> 01:14:00.520
It was one of the most useful

01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:03.920
Mutations he could have man

01:14:04.720 --> 01:14:06.720
agreed Daniel

01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:20.840
A simple yes or no Daniel I mean either it's useful to have to be able to show hinges upon you agreeing or disagreeing

01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:23.440
to this

01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:35.760
Okay, someone just yelled out more radio CB sick

01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:39.120
He's got Tourette's

01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:45.600
Yep, see I know stuff about people

01:14:46.840 --> 01:14:51.520
Do you want to pass these characters? He's down. Yeah, I do top-to-bottom, you know

01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:54.360
regular top-to-bottom 10 to 5 I got

01:14:56.280 --> 01:14:58.800
Things that nerds know but it sounds like

01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:06.320
It's like that movie mimic when the huge cockroaches look like they were homeless people on the subway

01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:10.880
And I'm gonna keep going with this analogy because it was

01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:17.920
What Oscar winners movie remember the movie mimic when the guy kept going miss I

01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:21.840
Love that movie

01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:24.920
Are you talking about Armageddon?

01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:32.920
That's that's a that's a $50 bill from Joel. Can you give meltdown another $80 for their microphone?

01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:40.360
Can we edit that out so that I think people are gonna love that while they're jogging people like

01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:46.360
I'm gonna be driving to work and their cars gonna flip over

01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:58.280
Okay, Duncan, you're you are quark. You're not Krista Burke, so you don't have to mutilate

01:16:01.120 --> 01:16:07.240
I'm sorry I did that I really am I wish I'd never mutilated Camille's care. We're all human man

01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:13.440
And you never really played D&D before you don't know what's what it's all good. Yeah, I should never have done that

01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:16.840
I'm sorry Camille. I should have never done a lot of things that I done

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.200
In the movie mimic. There's an old man

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:26.760
There's these like moth monsters that inhabit the subway and the

01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:34.280
They look like old men in trench coats and the only way the only person that knows right away is the autistic child of a

01:16:34.280 --> 01:16:37.280
Shoeshine guy and the autistic kid calls him

01:16:37.920 --> 01:16:42.960
Mr. Funny Shoes like this and so and so his father keeps going like mr. Funny Shoes

01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:46.160
You're gonna watch the movie mimic

01:16:47.160 --> 01:16:49.560
And then the kids bring home a

01:16:50.720 --> 01:16:55.720
A huge cockroach baby and with the best part is that they stored in a Cheerios box

01:16:55.720 --> 01:17:01.360
Which I'm sure I can't imagine the meeting they had with with General Mills where they're like they want

01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:07.040
To store the deadly baby. Is that mimic one or mimic two mimic one?

01:17:07.640 --> 01:17:09.640
Who's a joke?

01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:14.840
Make one is mimic

01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:20.600
The only mimic this motherfucker's a mimic purist. Everyone knows that the best sequel is called mimics

01:17:22.080 --> 01:17:24.080
Like aliens come on I

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
Like mimic

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:37.680
Mr. Funny Shoes, he like yells it out there like the phrase mr. Funny Shoes done in this horrible Italian accent

01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:41.200
Mr. Funny Shoes

01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:45.120
Mr. Funny Shoes

01:17:46.080 --> 01:17:49.440
Hey Spencer. Hey, I have a post it from the

01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:57.040
Netflix original arrest of development. It's a classic. It says gained items robot baby plus power unit 300 gold

01:17:57.040 --> 01:17:59.440
Yeah, okay, so

01:18:00.920 --> 01:18:02.920
Did you say you had a question?

01:18:04.120 --> 01:18:07.560
I was letting you know that I have it because I'm gonna kick your ass all over this thing

01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:13.840
No, is that that was part of the character that I'm oh, yeah, yeah

01:18:14.840 --> 01:18:19.520
Robot baby. All right great. All right. You could kick anyone's ass with that

01:18:19.520 --> 01:18:24.200
So you in the live audience like you you you're a couple episodes behind

01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:29.920
Because because we haven't aired the podcast, but that's so you have to pay particular attention to

01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:31.960
Spencer's

01:18:31.960 --> 01:18:36.200
Summary. Yeah, this is like watching Game of Thrones four episodes ahead

01:18:37.240 --> 01:18:39.240
Yeah, and you guys on stage you

01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:43.640
You have to listen really less

01:18:43.640 --> 01:18:53.800
Because so dusty do you got any music or

01:19:13.960 --> 01:19:18.040
Closer I start to try try to do the German version

01:19:30.680 --> 01:19:32.680
Last time on Harmontown

01:19:32.760 --> 01:19:39.440
Our heroes were deep underground on a sacred and secret passageway known as the ghost way

01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:47.600
After leaving Rose book our gang was headed to Farnheim the frozen city to confront Admiral Darkstar

01:19:47.720 --> 01:19:54.480
But they didn't know where to go so they hired a guide one young boy named Lil Baskins

01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:04.040
Baskins was cheery but wasn't as he seemed for the group quickly seemed to suss out his true nature that he was in fact

01:20:04.040 --> 01:20:10.400
The ghost of a long-dead child just trying to earn an honest dollar the gang embraced

01:20:10.560 --> 01:20:17.000
Baskins in love and acceptance and the group was off Lil Baskins guided them into a secret and pitch black passageway

01:20:17.320 --> 01:20:23.560
Warning them that the spirits don't appreciate the light and they attempted to blunder through the darkness blindly

01:20:23.640 --> 01:20:26.760
But after falling into an overcoming a pit trap

01:20:27.280 --> 01:20:30.480
Christopher realized that he had night vision goggles

01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:37.480
The trip was about to get a lot easier or was it what mysteries lie ahead on the ghost way?

01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:43.040
What spirits lurk in the dark depths and what of the robot baby find out now?

01:20:48.960 --> 01:20:53.440
That was so serene like I want I want that CD yeah

01:20:53.440 --> 01:21:01.600
That's what Katara I think I hope that's a local artist that we can all support like the end of a Felicity episode

01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:05.080
It's like if you like tonight's D&D music

01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:09.240
Go to go to go to go to go to go to jet jet face

01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:15.720
Jet faces jet faces at LACMA this week, I think yeah

01:21:15.720 --> 01:21:22.280
Yeah, he has a live instance. He's picked a name ironic to his genre of music

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
He's largely an ambient artist

01:21:25.640 --> 01:21:29.740
He wanted to he wanted to make a big impact on that scene a jet face

01:21:30.560 --> 01:21:32.560
Coming to the stage now is jet face

01:21:37.040 --> 01:21:44.360
You can see jet faces work at the new LA natural history museum in the dinosaur exhibit music hit the music hit the music

01:21:44.360 --> 01:21:50.000
Well, you learn about glaciers jet face will be playing. It won't play the music while you're doing it

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:55.680
Oh, no, it doesn't I mean come on jet. He's got to queue it up. The cassette has to be rewound

01:21:59.240 --> 01:22:01.760
Shit, but don't worry. It's not a metal tape. All right

01:22:04.080 --> 01:22:06.080
Jet face is

01:22:06.840 --> 01:22:10.600
Coming to your town. I'm jet faces manager

Tinklage

01:22:17.960 --> 01:22:21.520
Do you like in your face ambient sounds that

01:22:22.760 --> 01:22:25.840
Relax the fuck out of your entire nervous system

01:22:26.840 --> 01:22:31.800
Do you want to be swept to the fuck up in cosmic serenity?

01:22:33.160 --> 01:22:36.120
Come to the third street Wilkinson bridge

01:22:36.120 --> 01:22:41.080
We're gonna show slides of glacial movement

01:22:42.160 --> 01:22:44.160
blue whales fucking

01:22:45.400 --> 01:22:47.400
With music by

01:22:47.760 --> 01:22:52.160
Chet Chet Chet Chet Chet Chet Chet Chet Chet Chet Chet Chet Chet Chet Chet Chet Chet Face

01:22:56.280 --> 01:22:57.600
And that

01:22:57.600 --> 01:22:59.600
That was just jet faces manager

01:23:00.280 --> 01:23:02.280
That was just that was the pitch

01:23:02.280 --> 01:23:08.440
That was the pitch. Yeah, if you hang out with the actual guy your hotel rooms getting burnt. Yeah

01:23:09.280 --> 01:23:11.280
His hotel rooms have concrete floors

01:23:13.760 --> 01:23:16.720
Melting skull oil paintings of Rockefeller

01:23:20.520 --> 01:23:23.160
Dan I would see jet face in a second

01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:33.560
Jet face see the Austin bats fly out from under the bridge and jet face. Don't you mean Houston bats?

01:23:37.640 --> 01:23:42.360
You're right too soon. What were they booing? I don't get it. They don't know what

01:23:45.640 --> 01:23:50.240
So usually everyone doesn't know what's happening is that right? Yeah, that's usually the yes

01:23:50.240 --> 01:23:53.080
That's the case. You're in total complete darkness

01:23:53.360 --> 01:23:58.720
You can hear the echoes of your voices and you find that from what you can hear you must be in a huge

01:23:59.240 --> 01:24:00.640
Underground cavern

01:24:00.640 --> 01:24:03.240
You've just passed the pit trap and you're you're

01:24:03.840 --> 01:24:10.600
Re-consolidating blindly and ready to earn taking stock of your situation. Who's Chris de Burgh here? It's it's Daniel

01:24:10.600 --> 01:24:14.560
All right, Joel. Okay, so you just your character just put on

01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:20.880
A dark vision goggles, right? Well, he didn't put them on yet. Would you like to put them on? I don't care

01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:31.200
Does it advance this podcast? Yeah, of course I put on my dark vision goggles. I would love to know who's yes

01:24:31.200 --> 01:24:33.200
I cannot wait. I put on the fucking goggles

01:24:34.520 --> 01:24:39.640
Putting on the goggles everything comes into sharp relief. You're on a narrow pathway

01:24:39.640 --> 01:24:46.200
That's no more than 10 feet wide stretching on into darkness flanked by bottomless pits on both sides

01:24:46.680 --> 01:24:48.680
You'll have to watch your step

01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:51.360
We watch our steps

01:24:51.720 --> 01:24:56.480
You watch your step, but they can't because they're still blind. Hey, what do you see?

01:24:58.600 --> 01:25:02.880
What do I see you see a pathway flanked by bottomless pits

01:25:02.880 --> 01:25:10.120
I see a past pathway with a bunch of bottomless pits and there's a woman from Liverpool with us. All right

01:25:10.120 --> 01:25:12.120
Well, we'll watch our step

01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:19.320
You you can't watch your step you're blind. Well, I

01:25:19.320 --> 01:25:29.920
Well, why can't we do like these where they're like they go like this. Yeah, like he's he's doing a prancing pony

01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:40.840
He's putting his foot in front of yeah, I mean the water like he's

01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:47.400
He's telling us because he can see he's like telling us. Okay. We're standing on a very narrow thing

01:25:47.400 --> 01:25:49.400
So, yeah, we're

01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:54.080
Should we should we fire up like a I shoot an arrow at something?

01:25:54.600 --> 01:25:59.800
Get an arrow into the darkness. Can I I'm just gonna cast mage light miss. Okay, you cast

01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:07.640
Roll it die. How do you know what cuz you didn't hit any or you didn't aim it. Oh, sorry. Can I little little baskets?

01:26:07.640 --> 01:26:15.280
Oh, hey, I'm about to cast mage light. Is that cool? No, I told you total darkness the spirits don't appreciate lights

01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:21.120
Okay, all right. Okay. Okay. Okay. So why don't we do like the hokey pokey where you put your hands on each other's shoulders?

01:26:21.120 --> 01:26:23.120
Yeah, and and he leads us

01:26:23.400 --> 01:26:25.400
Yeah, it's like a wet. It's like a wet

01:26:28.680 --> 01:26:30.680
Yeah, we're gonna line you fucking

01:26:33.880 --> 01:26:35.880
That's where did you get that shirt?

01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:41.360
Fuck off. I call the hokey pokey when I'm in a game through this dark cave assholes

01:26:41.360 --> 01:26:46.880
Spaddle over this nice foreign lady

01:26:49.160 --> 01:26:52.440
She's from Liverpool that's that's that's that's called Tuesday

01:26:55.640 --> 01:26:57.640
Spencer we're doing a conga line

01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:07.560
Yeah in conga line formation this cave you find it really easy to make your way through through the through the passageway

01:27:07.560 --> 01:27:10.560
It turns out that that's all it took

01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:14.720
Great spend ten minutes on that

01:27:15.320 --> 01:27:16.760
Thank you

01:27:16.760 --> 01:27:23.880
So you get you get to the end of the passageway and you can feel the wind coming in from the other side of a port

01:27:23.880 --> 01:27:25.880
Colas, that's a that's a locked gate

01:27:26.920 --> 01:27:33.560
With mechanical armaments that make it work and portcullis is a locked gate. It's like a locked gate with your ears

01:27:33.560 --> 01:27:38.480
It's a locked gate because a portcullis has gears and shit and gates don't typically have gears

01:27:38.480 --> 01:27:44.880
I don't you're right. I stand very correct. Why are you trying to wait? He's the dungeon. I'm a dungeon master, man

01:27:45.560 --> 01:27:47.560
What I'm a dungeon master

01:27:50.080 --> 01:27:53.000
He's a he's a Joel played football in

01:27:53.480 --> 01:27:55.480
Yeah, the real

01:27:55.600 --> 01:27:57.600
Dungeons and Dragons, so he's like

01:27:57.600 --> 01:28:03.800
He's kicking sand on the umpire. That's what he's doing. They have right umpires and

01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:11.920
That was the perfect touch job, what are you talking about? What are you talking about strike three?

01:28:14.240 --> 01:28:16.080
Two-yard penalty

01:28:16.080 --> 01:28:18.520
All right, so okay. Yeah, all right

01:28:18.520 --> 01:28:26.720
You find yourself at this portcullis the the wind blowing in your face indicates that you must be near the surface as fresh air is flowing

01:28:26.720 --> 01:28:32.120
If you could get past this portcullis, you might be out of here. Little Baskins is like

01:28:32.120 --> 01:28:35.880
Uh, I don't know how to you know, I just usually phase through walls

01:28:35.880 --> 01:28:41.480
So I don't know how to help you guys out the robot baby said that a little Baskins. He's a ghost boy

01:28:42.040 --> 01:28:49.040
We have a robot baby and a ghost boy. I can understand your confusion. We would what we asked the robot baby

01:28:49.040 --> 01:28:51.040
What what should we do? We're at this?

01:28:51.040 --> 01:28:58.640
Complicated gate. We should uh, we should try and unlock it. I think unlock it. Hold on. Hold on. We should try to lock it

01:28:58.640 --> 01:28:59.920
I think

01:28:59.920 --> 01:29:06.480
Sorry, sorry everybody that makes sense now. That's how robots talk. That's how robot babies talk. Yeah, that's one of two voices

01:29:06.480 --> 01:29:08.240
I do

01:29:08.240 --> 01:29:13.920
All right robot baby. Well, do you think you could unlock it? I can do it as sure as I like getting kicked

01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:15.920
You

01:29:20.200 --> 01:29:23.320
Like it and you like getting kicked I love it. I

01:29:25.320 --> 01:29:27.320
Kick the robot baby

01:29:28.200 --> 01:29:30.200
He likes it

01:29:30.440 --> 01:29:35.440
You knock him into the portcullis and he hits it with a sharp clang before bouncing off

01:29:35.440 --> 01:29:37.940
He said he can like getting kicked

01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:42.360
He what he said he can like getting kicked. I sure can

01:29:42.360 --> 01:29:48.320
He could also like not getting kicked, right robot baby. I sure can

01:29:50.400 --> 01:29:52.400
He doesn't feel pain clearly

01:29:57.200 --> 01:30:03.440
He said he likes getting I misunderstood I thought he said he likes getting kids that he can like getting kicked

01:30:03.440 --> 01:30:05.440
I can like it

01:30:05.840 --> 01:30:10.560
Did him kicking robot baby into the gate unlock it? Oh, yeah, yeah

01:30:10.560 --> 01:30:14.560
We all contain multitudes. All right

01:30:17.400 --> 01:30:23.680
Christopher you're a Christopher is a thief, right? He sure is Christopher. I know you're Daniel. Okay?

01:30:23.680 --> 01:30:29.240
Who's Daniel? Oh, Janelle nitty. Okay. Do you want to be Christopher? No, no, no, no. No, it's not a big deal

01:30:29.240 --> 01:30:31.580
If they Joel Christopher, you're a thief

01:30:32.200 --> 01:30:35.120
You could unlock the I will steal the gate. I

01:30:35.120 --> 01:30:37.120
I

01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:40.640
Put it in my room

01:30:40.640 --> 01:30:43.280
My cape my hooded cape. Oh

01:30:44.120 --> 01:30:51.000
I will use whatever you would recommend to unlock this case. Well, I'd ask I let the chef

01:30:51.600 --> 01:30:58.280
Don't be cheating you gotta ask Dan Dan probably can help you out. Well, you should probably have some thief tools. It's true inventory

01:30:58.880 --> 01:31:03.840
Would that be in my gear? Yeah, I promise you have thief tools. Oh, I'm gonna use

01:31:03.840 --> 01:31:06.240
boring podcast to get through there

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.580
I'm sitting here reading in front of you

01:31:12.360 --> 01:31:19.040
I'm quietly reading my gear and not just and you're like, how dare you we can the tension is huge

01:31:21.200 --> 01:31:27.800
All right, I'm going to say a number of things and you tell me if I can use them team. All right

01:31:27.800 --> 01:31:42.200
Thieves tools. Yeah, I'm so sorry. I lashed out the way it is. All right. It's all right. The world is changing man. Yeah, I

01:31:43.160 --> 01:31:48.520
Do have some acid if you need that later and one one Bola. I don't know what that is

01:31:48.560 --> 01:31:52.680
That's a should I use a smoke bomb? You could I mean now

01:31:52.680 --> 01:31:57.160
I'm gonna use the thieves tools on the road the gate on the what do you call it?

01:31:58.560 --> 01:32:00.240
Shut up. I

01:32:00.240 --> 01:32:08.320
Don't care using using your thieves tools. You completely dismantle the portcullis and can easily detach it and take it wherever you'd like

01:32:09.920 --> 01:32:15.740
Welcome assholes. Yeah, thank you. See oh see you played Dungeons & Dragons

01:32:16.720 --> 01:32:19.320
It's just like on that TV show it was pretty

01:32:19.320 --> 01:32:26.240
It was like the cartoon for when I was a kid and that movie with one of the Wayans brothers

01:32:26.240 --> 01:32:32.160
Oh my god, that movie was is so good. Awesome. Yeah, what it's

01:32:32.720 --> 01:32:36.680
Everyone share me irons was amazing in that movie. Oh my god

01:32:38.200 --> 01:32:41.840
Dan have you ever had the Dungeon Master flip-bat like this? I don't think so

01:32:41.840 --> 01:32:42.800
I

01:32:42.800 --> 01:32:47.040
Never talked to him about the shitty Dungeons & Dragons movie. It's so bad

01:32:47.040 --> 01:32:50.760
It starts with like he murders a dragon and then CG blood

01:32:50.760 --> 01:32:55.840
Which is doing the same thing that normal water, but you know colored red would do downstairs

01:32:56.080 --> 01:32:59.360
But it's terrible CG and you're like this is gonna be good

01:33:00.760 --> 01:33:04.760
And it doesn't disappoint in that it completely disappoints

01:33:06.080 --> 01:33:12.440
I just remember like one like monster guy in the city going like if you want I will cut up your heart

01:33:13.320 --> 01:33:15.760
Like he does like this really weird performance thing

01:33:15.760 --> 01:33:16.680
and

01:33:16.680 --> 01:33:18.680
Yeah, that was it

01:33:19.480 --> 01:33:26.160
And as I my face turned bright red and I like I just looked down at something for the rest of the movie

01:33:26.520 --> 01:33:31.240
Yeah, that sounds about right. There's this guy with blue. All right through the portcull. Yeah, that was the guy

01:33:31.240 --> 01:33:36.600
He looked like a frangie kind of and they never explained that choice and it doesn't matter at all that he looked like that

01:33:36.600 --> 01:33:42.280
Oh my god, I bet everything please watch it grips were high-fiving that guy awesome acting choice

01:33:42.280 --> 01:33:49.000
Yeah, that was amazing. We're at the end of your line. You went. Oh, that was a weird at all

01:33:49.640 --> 01:33:54.600
That was actual acting. You did great. I'd love it. Shut up. Danielle. Let us play

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:59.280
How did this get made should do the Dungeons and Dragons movie?

01:34:00.040 --> 01:34:01.840
Yeah, tell them that

01:34:01.840 --> 01:34:04.200
portcullous threshold transgressors

01:34:06.120 --> 01:34:12.000
You walk into a natural stone cave with its dimly lit from the outside light little Baskins is like

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:17.880
You know when we get out, it's gonna wait. That's not his voice. Sorry little Baskins like when we get out

01:34:17.880 --> 01:34:24.400
It's gonna be real cold and you know unless you have some serious parkas. We're gonna need to gear up or you're freeze to death

01:34:25.040 --> 01:34:32.440
Okay, so just you know keep that in mind. I put on a coat. You don't have a coat. I put on the gate

01:34:32.440 --> 01:34:34.440
I just

01:34:34.440 --> 01:34:42.240
I like I like my flaming sword. I have a flaming sword. You do that. So it's I light it or whatever you do

01:34:42.240 --> 01:34:49.120
I click it to get it going and I would like to say thank you for that. Thank you. So we have warmth now so works, right?

01:34:49.120 --> 01:34:53.680
Yeah, you guys have warmth currently don't I still have a thing of resisting elements of something

01:34:53.680 --> 01:34:57.560
I think there's the resistance cloak, but uh, yeah, I mean if

01:34:57.560 --> 01:35:04.240
Little Baskins is like that cloaks not gonna work. What winners coming? I?

01:35:05.120 --> 01:35:09.160
Put on the amulet of autumn so it's not that cold yet

01:35:14.640 --> 01:35:20.040
But that I was like burning leaves that's the season it currently is I was like pumpkin spice

01:35:20.920 --> 01:35:23.080
Are you it's a little Baskins?

01:35:23.080 --> 01:35:29.520
It's gonna get so cold out there that resist to elements doesn't work. Well resist elements is a spell

01:35:29.520 --> 01:35:33.400
I'm talking about your cloak of resistance. He got there. It's pretty shabby if you ask me

01:35:35.800 --> 01:35:42.840
What do you recommend little Baskins some warm animal hides we gotta go hunting what do you whatever you want?

01:35:42.840 --> 01:35:48.200
Did we just spin off into a different like series like we're just gonna be about us hunting and curing leather

01:35:48.200 --> 01:35:53.160
Hey, do you want to freeze to death because it could be about that instead I?

01:35:55.360 --> 01:35:58.080
Killed Danielle's character and hide inside of her body

01:35:59.800 --> 01:36:04.160
She's a taunt on right it's like that. All right. I don't die. I retract that all right

01:36:04.160 --> 01:36:10.720
All right guys. Well, I guess we have to go hunting for indigenous species. This is so exciting

01:36:12.280 --> 01:36:14.280
Let's go looking for stuff

01:36:14.280 --> 01:36:20.120
So you as you're exiting the cave you hear the sound of some sort of snoring beast

01:36:26.240 --> 01:36:28.160
I hope it has fur

01:36:35.960 --> 01:36:39.080
Proceeding ahead you can see two sleeping rhinocerai

01:36:39.960 --> 01:36:41.640
Holy shit

01:36:41.640 --> 01:36:43.640
Those motherfuckers are covered in leather

01:36:45.160 --> 01:36:50.880
But not fur yeah, yeah, but leather we can have a leather party if we kill these

01:36:54.040 --> 01:36:56.040
Okay

01:37:03.960 --> 01:37:06.920
What do you think what's your character's name?

01:37:06.920 --> 01:37:11.840
Dignity SARS guard. What do you think you want to do that? Okay?

01:37:13.400 --> 01:37:16.360
But what if we could tame them and rise stop talking to loud

01:37:17.520 --> 01:37:22.120
What if we tame these rhinos? What would teaming we're not gonna kill right?

01:37:22.120 --> 01:37:27.280
We don't have time to tame the rhinocerai wait. I kind of want to hear what just out of morbid curiosity

01:37:28.480 --> 01:37:31.160
What wait, where do you see teaming them going?

01:37:31.160 --> 01:37:37.080
Because then when we're in the cold they can pee on us to keep us warm

01:37:38.280 --> 01:37:42.920
Not only will be warm, but we get to have get really aroused by water sports

01:37:44.120 --> 01:37:48.600
Do you understand that the only reason pee is warm is because it's inside a

01:37:49.360 --> 01:37:52.800
Rhino there's a lot of pee in a rhino

01:37:52.800 --> 01:38:00.880
Yeah, but dude the moment the pee hits the outside then we'll be cold from being wet. Not everybody's a scientist

01:38:08.720 --> 01:38:10.800
Why did you bring this dick with us?

01:38:11.880 --> 01:38:14.680
It wasn't it wasn't for moments like this that just

01:38:15.720 --> 01:38:18.280
I see these fuckers we ambush the rhinos

01:38:18.840 --> 01:38:20.640
We could at least

01:38:20.640 --> 01:38:23.840
Use their meat to lure furrier animals

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
We have a plan

01:38:33.760 --> 01:38:39.880
I'm gonna throw some blinding powder at them, okay blinding power plop powders powders

01:38:39.880 --> 01:38:46.560
Oh, are you guys gonna anyone else gonna do anything right at this turn before the rhinoceroses, you know, yeah

01:38:46.560 --> 01:38:48.560
What is God's bread?

01:38:48.560 --> 01:38:51.320
God's bread is a plant

01:38:52.160 --> 01:38:54.160
Are you asking me?

01:38:54.520 --> 01:39:00.160
It's a magical plant. What does it do? It's not gonna kill rhinoceros you eat a couple leaves of it

01:39:00.160 --> 01:39:02.360
And it's like eating an entire loaf of bread

01:39:02.960 --> 01:39:06.280
Which is really my nightmare. I'm using my

01:39:07.800 --> 01:39:14.520
I'd like to use my armulet of spring to ensnare the rhinos with 20 feet of

01:39:15.680 --> 01:39:17.040
Vines

01:39:17.040 --> 01:39:22.600
Yep, and I use my amulet of winter to call a sleet storm on top of the

01:39:23.640 --> 01:39:27.920
Well now we're gonna be really cold asshole. Well, it's on the rhinos. It's not us

01:39:28.920 --> 01:39:30.920
Your sleet storm is that

01:39:31.160 --> 01:39:33.160
discerning and specific

01:39:33.440 --> 01:39:36.920
Yes, it's like rain in Miami. It's a

01:39:38.400 --> 01:39:42.520
All right, what about a dignity you want to do anything somebody stab these things

01:39:42.520 --> 01:39:47.400
That's yeah throwing ox. I can throw my throwing ox on it. All right

01:39:48.240 --> 01:39:50.240
doing those things

01:39:52.120 --> 01:39:57.960
Chris de Burgh throws his blinding powder into the midst of the of the of the rhinos is

01:39:58.520 --> 01:40:00.520
Dignity loses her axe

01:40:00.960 --> 01:40:05.800
It uh, it strikes one of them right in the shoulder above its front leg dealing

01:40:08.880 --> 01:40:10.880
Five damage

01:40:10.880 --> 01:40:12.880
Nice nice job

01:40:13.520 --> 01:40:21.100
Chris de Burgh summons a sleet storm sending driving sleet and ice and it's cold water quark quark did it not

01:40:21.100 --> 01:40:23.600
Christopher weird day for these rhinos

01:40:26.400 --> 01:40:28.600
Blind what happened that's cold

01:40:29.960 --> 01:40:31.640
snowing

01:40:31.640 --> 01:40:36.720
Into the cave. What did Dan do? I use my armulet of spring to ensnare them so that they are

01:40:36.720 --> 01:40:41.000
a captive audience for these rather nefarious activities

01:40:42.800 --> 01:40:47.640
While you launch vines towards the rhinocerai you you casting your

01:40:48.080 --> 01:40:50.680
Magical armulet takes a bit longer than throwing

01:40:51.480 --> 01:40:58.760
Throwing an axe so the rhinocerai is hit by the axe bolts upright and charges out of out of the cave

01:40:59.480 --> 01:41:02.560
But the other one is entangled fast and blinded

01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:06.160
It's it's struggling wildly like a mad animal

01:41:07.120 --> 01:41:10.480
That's I have something called a dragon dick. Yeah, that's

01:41:11.240 --> 01:41:15.120
That's got to do something great. It can fuck a dragon

01:41:17.600 --> 01:41:23.900
Can I fuck this charging rhino like a dragon the charging rhino has left the cave

01:41:23.900 --> 01:41:33.460
Oh, you can fuck the risk. I don't I don't like the idea of the blind rhino. It doesn't sound good. Do it. Fuck the blind

01:41:33.940 --> 01:41:36.100
I use my dragon dick on the blind rhino

01:41:40.740 --> 01:41:42.740
Untweetable, yeah

01:41:43.100 --> 01:41:49.820
It's way too big you couldn't even get it into anything dragons are giant. They're fucking big, right?

01:41:49.820 --> 01:41:53.780
How does he where does he mission accomplished? Sorry guys my dick's too big

01:41:55.620 --> 01:41:57.620
Nice nice

01:42:00.700 --> 01:42:05.980
To big to put on right now who has a sword all of you have swords I think oh

01:42:08.140 --> 01:42:11.100
Yeah, I hit it with my flaming sword

01:42:12.980 --> 01:42:17.260
Barbecue dude you do that and it deals some amount of damage

01:42:17.260 --> 01:42:24.900
Well, that's pretty obvious, right? Yeah, I think so especially when you hit him ten damage and it catches fire

01:42:27.340 --> 01:42:33.620
Rhino meat for everybody however the fire it burns out the vines and it becomes unintentioned

01:42:34.700 --> 01:42:36.980
Shit sorry. It's cool

01:42:38.180 --> 01:42:41.900
It struggles to its feet and starts crashing into the cavern walls

01:42:41.900 --> 01:42:50.020
It starts sending rocks and then sand and dirt coming down from the ceiling above. It's it's getting kind of dangerous

01:42:50.900 --> 01:42:54.260
But you aren't attacked by it because it's all to keep warm

01:42:55.260 --> 01:42:58.340
It's all because you decided to do stuff to rhinos. I mean

01:43:00.740 --> 01:43:06.420
We could have walked past them and hoped to come to it like a coke factory or you could have crept up on them and slit

01:43:06.420 --> 01:43:11.580
Their throats. I mean, there's a lot of factory right over on the other side of the rhinos

01:43:16.020 --> 01:43:18.020
Okay, dude, I think that

01:43:18.460 --> 01:43:22.580
Morene is the only person that could cast resist elements and she's dead

01:43:23.500 --> 01:43:26.900
What do you guys want to do? Should we kill this rhino? I think we have

01:43:28.660 --> 01:43:30.660
What Tourette's I

01:43:30.660 --> 01:43:32.660
I

01:43:35.740 --> 01:43:40.900
Okay, I'm gonna who's who's up next whoever goes first I have chains

01:43:40.900 --> 01:43:46.940
I use the I throw my chains around the rhinos legs to try to snare it

01:43:48.420 --> 01:43:52.740
All right, the rampaging rhino is too wild to get your chains in it

01:43:53.620 --> 01:43:59.940
Sorry, I would have shocking grasp. I hear the kids. I got I'm a slave to the streets

01:43:59.940 --> 01:44:01.940
I will give them what they want

01:44:01.980 --> 01:44:06.080
It's part of the urban culture. I will do shocking grasp on the rhino

01:44:09.060 --> 01:44:14.060
Striking the rhino with a lightning infuse the grap grasping motion

01:44:15.220 --> 01:44:21.020
What are you doing to my mind? It looks like having sex with a shocking the rhino. Yeah

01:44:23.100 --> 01:44:25.380
It takes 25 lightning

01:44:25.380 --> 01:44:27.380
Yeah

01:44:28.900 --> 01:44:34.620
We're saved we are saved and it falls to the ground stunned it's not dead

01:44:34.620 --> 01:44:36.820
But it's definitely I walk up and stab it in the throat

01:44:37.260 --> 01:44:42.900
Wait, can I talk to it? I'm gonna talk to it. Well, which do you do first? I speak rhino to it

01:44:42.900 --> 01:44:47.100
No, you don't speak rhino. Oh, yeah, you don't sorry. I had to make sure

01:44:48.660 --> 01:44:52.580
First thought best thought stab it at the foot. I stab it in the throat

01:44:52.580 --> 01:44:59.580
And I yeah, and then I try to saw its head off and then I want to wear the head

01:45:02.340 --> 01:45:04.340
Wait, wait, I stop him

01:45:05.300 --> 01:45:07.300
Let it piss on us first

01:45:08.020 --> 01:45:14.140
It's not he didn't say it was pissing. We're not gonna wait around for that. All right. We are dude

01:45:14.140 --> 01:45:20.140
We are people I guess I'm fine in this cave. You already unleashed a cold storm onto the thing. We're freezing fine

01:45:20.140 --> 01:45:27.460
That's true. You guys are pretty chilly, but you find it rather easy to stab the stunned beast in the throat and saw off

01:45:27.460 --> 01:45:29.460
It's head and wear it on your head

01:45:32.860 --> 01:45:38.380
It's a look that you definitely can pull off and now I'm gonna sing something by black Sabbath. I'm not sure what

01:45:39.300 --> 01:45:41.300
Just about no

01:45:41.300 --> 01:45:50.300
Black Sabbath song black Sabbath is the best man ever. No, it's been a hard year for black Sabbath as if I were Elvis Costello

01:45:50.300 --> 01:45:52.300
I'm gonna sing about black Sabbath

01:45:56.380 --> 01:46:02.380
Dead rhino. All right, we got we got one dead right. You know what they say. Yep one dead rhino

01:46:03.300 --> 01:46:05.300
It's better than albino

01:46:05.300 --> 01:46:13.980
Yeah, I have a skinning knife. You sure do. I start skinning this rhino. All right, you

01:46:15.420 --> 01:46:19.420
Yeah, it's easy enough you skin it. I'll go get the other rhino guys

01:46:21.260 --> 01:46:26.180
And I trot off like a like a breathless Hillary Swank in an action film

01:46:26.180 --> 01:46:31.380
Let's just somebody wear the rhino and let's get on with this thing. We've got what we got to move on with them

01:46:31.380 --> 01:46:36.820
What is our point of all of this? What's the point? Where are we going? Fornheim the frozen city?

01:46:37.300 --> 01:46:43.700
We're gonna freeze to death is the thing. We got rhinos. We killed they're not gonna make us warmer. I guess

01:46:44.140 --> 01:46:47.180
Do you think we could make warmth out of rhinos?

01:46:47.860 --> 01:46:51.980
Yeah, I don't help a little bit. I mean maybe stuff some like hay in there

01:46:51.980 --> 01:46:58.420
Oh, is there hay around not in the cave, but maybe somewhere or dried leaves. I know I don't know cardboard

01:46:58.420 --> 01:47:06.020
Newspapers I run off where the other papers and cardboard in D&D. No, I'm sorry. I was I was being a

01:47:06.580 --> 01:47:08.580
Word I'm in pursuit of the other rhino

01:47:09.100 --> 01:47:15.700
Yeah, you are you step out of the cave into a into a similar graveyard in the forest

01:47:15.700 --> 01:47:20.120
It's a nice little graveyard with probably less than 30 graves in it

01:47:20.120 --> 01:47:27.880
You can see that several of the graves are just devastated and a large portion of the fence has been dismantled as if a rhino had charged through it

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:34.440
Are there are there are there corpses or bodies in the devastated graves? Uh-huh

01:47:36.280 --> 01:47:42.640
Probably I mean wearing clothes. Do they have maybe we could wear the corpse clothes to keep warm little

01:47:43.160 --> 01:47:45.160
I don't want to smell that bad

01:47:45.160 --> 01:47:52.400
Little Baskins. Hey guys, I'm little Baskins. You're dead. What do you make of this cemetery? It's uh

01:47:53.640 --> 01:47:55.640
Right, I feel right at home

01:47:56.800 --> 01:48:00.040
Are you gonna be offended if we desecrate these graves look for fur coats?

01:48:00.800 --> 01:48:05.240
Well, it looks like those guys are right ahead of you in the corner of the graveyard

01:48:05.240 --> 01:48:11.240
You see two dark figures that are hunched over they look like they're digging digging for something grave robbers

01:48:11.240 --> 01:48:13.840
You didn't see him before because a rhino devastation

01:48:13.840 --> 01:48:21.000
The two forms stand up they reveal themselves to be gnolls and they're like, oh shit. You are here fast

01:48:22.880 --> 01:48:24.880
We fuck

01:48:30.240 --> 01:48:33.200
You identify yourselves

01:48:34.160 --> 01:48:37.000
You you bastards I will not do that

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:45.000
Don't you don't you remember when you killed our brother our brother Yerch in cold blood?

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000
And we swore vengeance

01:48:48.640 --> 01:48:50.640
This is that bitch

01:48:51.320 --> 01:48:56.600
This is your vengeance. Oh, yeah running into you in a well cemetery

01:48:56.600 --> 01:49:01.920
Yeah, we're a bit late for our vengeance and remember that and then remember the time we got vengeance on that one guy

01:49:01.920 --> 01:49:09.480
By digging and hoping he would come near us. My friend has a point your vengeance is lame

01:49:12.360 --> 01:49:16.360
Well, why are we how are we seeking vengeance just keep digging he's gonna show up

01:49:16.360 --> 01:49:21.240
Let's go to a remote location and dig and then the vengeance will come up out of a box

01:49:21.240 --> 01:49:26.480
It doesn't work. We're gonna lay a sprinkling pipe and where's vengeance ever the the smaller of the two knolls

01:49:26.640 --> 01:49:30.880
Spreads his arm out and you see black lightning bolts surge into the earth below

01:49:30.880 --> 01:49:38.960
And then you hear a rumbling almost as if the ground is moving and several bony arms burst out of the soil and start to

01:49:39.040 --> 01:49:44.960
Pull themselves out to their feet. Oops. I pull out my hole. I have a hole. I pull out my holy symbol

01:49:44.960 --> 01:49:48.840
I have a holy symbol. Oh shit. You don't talk about your dick, bro. I

01:49:50.560 --> 01:49:52.560
Pull out my cock

01:49:54.160 --> 01:49:57.760
No, I'm not Chris de Burgh. No, it's not his

01:49:57.760 --> 01:50:00.400
Quark doesn't have a dick anymore either

01:50:01.080 --> 01:50:07.400
He has so two guys two people in this group. Yes, someone else's cock. He pulls it out

01:50:08.040 --> 01:50:11.600
Holy shit. Yeah, there's one cock left in the party

01:50:13.440 --> 01:50:19.520
Because Chris de Burgh cut his own penis off in an earlier episode. Yeah, it was awesome when I did that it was necessary

01:50:19.680 --> 01:50:23.600
And I'm fine. It's gonna grow back. I'm a fucking salamander. All right

01:50:23.600 --> 01:50:33.240
It takes a while. What do we kill these dead people, please? Yeah, do something you can you from Liverpool?

01:50:36.200 --> 01:50:38.760
All right, she she mumbles nothing

01:50:39.800 --> 01:50:43.840
She makes a high-pitched mumble. Does that work? It's super effective

01:50:44.880 --> 01:50:51.360
No, no, I'm sorry. That doesn't work. I look at these gnolls and I say y'all using blood magic

01:50:51.360 --> 01:50:55.200
Not yet, bitch, but I'm about to he

01:50:56.000 --> 01:51:00.080
Slashes his thumb open and smears it across the scroll and holds it above his head

01:51:00.080 --> 01:51:07.560
And you see a swirling torrent of blood come out of the scroll and surround these skeletal zombies and engulfing their forms and sticky

01:51:07.880 --> 01:51:10.240
Coagulated blood. Oh, all right anything else

01:51:11.680 --> 01:51:13.680
He pulls out a shotgun, okay

01:51:15.240 --> 01:51:17.400
I just want to know thank you

01:51:17.400 --> 01:51:22.640
All right, we should stop there. We got a big fight coming up with some skeletons. We're gonna stop Dungeons & Dragons there

01:51:23.160 --> 01:51:28.160
That's the that's the end of the show. Hold on. What what what all we did?

01:51:29.320 --> 01:51:36.200
Yeah, let's kill one of two rhinos for no reason welcome welcome and we were cold

01:51:36.320 --> 01:51:40.720
We accomplished more in this session than we've ever accomplished in G&D ever

01:51:40.720 --> 01:51:45.760
That's like Joel McHale for coming by

01:51:48.120 --> 01:51:52.000
Guest Comptroller Duncan Trussell Daniel from Liverpool

01:51:53.680 --> 01:51:55.680
As always

01:51:56.800 --> 01:52:03.000
The nerd melt theater Dustin Marshall back there and Zach working audio Spencer crittin's in the dungeon

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:10.280
Maybe go figure out a way to download the yahoo screen app back

01:52:10.680 --> 01:52:15.600
Download the yahoo screen app, but if you already have within months, it could become totally relevant

01:52:16.320 --> 01:52:20.520
And thank you guys from Communicon for coming and blessing us

01:52:20.520 --> 01:52:30.520
And we will see you in season six and then a movie and then beyond. Thanks you guys. All right
