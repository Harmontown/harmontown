{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:16.500\nLadies and gentlemen, Harmontown is now in session.\n\n00:16.500 --> 00:34.500\nAnd now, please welcome the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon!\n\n00:34.500 --> 00:43.500\nIt really worked out okay? Did that work? Okay, all right, we had a little false start there. Sure you don't want to, because we can pick it up.\n\n00:43.500 --> 00:50.500\nAll right, okay, you don't want to get a better, all right, because it seemed a little dry.\n\n00:50.500 --> 00:58.500\nSad. All right, Comptroller Duncan Trestle, things are going on.\n\n00:58.500 --> 01:12.500\nHow are you? I'm great, man. Thanks for asking. How you been? How's the tour going? It's going great. I've said I got nothing in the past, but really, I'm just rung like a rag.\n\n01:12.500 --> 01:22.500\nI did San Francisco, I did Austin, I did Houston in the last three days, and I went to Communicon. A lot of these people are here from Communicon.\n\n01:22.500 --> 01:40.500\nCommunicon, Duncan, home of the Communicorn. Wow. Oh wow, you know, I had a, in Vancouver, my cab driver asked me if I believed in unicorns and then started presenting a very convincing argument for the existence of unicorns in Africa.\n\n01:40.500 --> 01:46.500\nReally? Yeah, it was a long conversation.\n\n01:46.500 --> 02:02.500\nI didn't even know there was like a, I didn't even know that it was possible. It was so beautiful, his belief in unicorns. It was incredible, and I realized he kind of looks like a unicorn, and I started thinking, oh, he's a unicorn driving a cab.\n\n02:02.500 --> 02:12.500\nHe was saying unicorns exist, and does he think there's a cover-up? Yes.\n\n02:12.500 --> 02:16.500\nBecause the missing ingredient of this is there would have to be a cover-up.\n\n02:16.500 --> 02:26.500\nMy friend, all roads lead to reptilians when you believe in unicorns, because it ventured into the reptilian realm after he was explaining.\n\n02:26.500 --> 02:41.500\nLike once I told him, I definitely believe in unicorns, but I don't, but you know, like coast to coast, you know the show, Coast to Coast, when he's listening to people who believe in interesting ideas, he will just let them talk about it.\n\n02:41.500 --> 02:51.500\nIs that Art Bell? It's Art Bell. Now it's George Noray now, isn't it? Art Bell's coming back again, but he was the master of bringing out a person's story.\n\n02:51.500 --> 03:06.500\nSo yeah, what he said is that he went up into the woods for a long time, and he got the ability to pet squirrels, like squirrels wouldn't run from him anymore, because he had become so pure.\n\n03:06.500 --> 03:11.500\nSo that happened to him, and then he saw a unicorn, but he wasn't in Africa.\n\n03:11.500 --> 03:16.500\nHe never saw a unicorn, but it's the theory that unicorns will only come to someone who's very pure.\n\n03:16.500 --> 03:22.500\nSo his point is, you know, you start with squirrels, it's like a starter unicorn.\n\n03:22.500 --> 03:42.500\nSquirrel is like a burner cell phone for the aspiring drug dealer that is a unicorn handler. You're not Gus Fring just yet, you just got your little card, your little pay card.\n\n03:42.500 --> 04:02.500\nI feel like that is something that's a conversation that I would never have with a cab driver, and when I'm with Dino Stamatopoulos, I feel like I witness it happen within 10 minutes, it'll turn out, if the bartender is into SNM, it will come out.\n\n04:02.500 --> 04:19.500\nAnd Dino never says anything, he doesn't like walk around going, who's into SNM? But the bartender will just volunteer, because I'm near Dino, like she'll go, so did you want a rum and coke?\n\n04:19.500 --> 04:36.500\nOkay, here you go, like, can I tell you something crazy? And it's uncanny, and I think with you, I think this is a thing with people, like I think we emit like an aura, a pheromone or something, we kind of, it must be, right?\n\n04:36.500 --> 04:56.500\nI think so, it's, yeah, that's cool, I mean, I'd much rather somebody talk about SNM than unicorns, but on to say, actually, kind of, I like them both, but yeah, I know what you mean, this is something that is a chaos magic practice where you look at the entire universe as an oracle,\n\n04:56.500 --> 05:07.500\nand when you go out into the universe with the intention of learning something, it will start talking to you, and whatever you're putting out, it'll reflect back and give you a chance to learn more about the universe.\n\n05:07.500 --> 05:30.500\nIn this case, it was unicorns, man, but they, you know, the idea behind unicorns is that he knew all these crazy unicorn details, like, they carry a baby for two years in their stomach.\n\n05:30.500 --> 05:43.500\nIs it because the horn? Like, you should get a baby unicorn out of you as soon as possible, I would think, depending on how that horn works.\n\n05:43.500 --> 05:48.500\nWell, it's, the horn is a receiver, the horn acts as a kind of antenna, according to him.\n\n05:48.500 --> 06:07.500\nRight, because nothing in nature has no purpose, like God knows deer who have, like, way more than a unicorn horn, they're receiving all kinds of magic. No, they're just deer, this guy doesn't give a shit about deer, even though they have way more horns than unicorns.\n\n06:07.500 --> 06:20.500\nI just thought that was kind of odd, like, unicorns, they're not that remarkable, they're just a horse with one shitty horn. It's like, they're almost less remarkable looking than a deer.\n\n06:20.500 --> 06:28.500\nThat's right, yeah, they are, I guess they're albino, there's something about them, they're sort of white in glory.\n\n06:28.500 --> 06:31.500\nBig deal, there's white horses. Big deal.\n\n06:31.500 --> 06:38.500\nThey're blood kills illnesses. They're blood kills, you're just quoting, like, the monster manual.\n\n06:38.500 --> 06:54.500\nI'm saying that the image of a unicorn, like, it's just a horse with a horn, that's the bare minimum requirement of a unicorn, and I think it's kind of funny, because if you add a second horn, you immediately get, like, a gazelle.\n\n06:54.500 --> 07:01.500\nAnd, like, a shitty one, too, because it's, like, not curved yet, and you're like, oh, look at that shitty gazelle.\n\n07:01.500 --> 07:05.500\nOh, that's not a shitty gazelle, that's a double unicorn.\n\n07:05.500 --> 07:10.500\nAlright, well, excuse me for not.\n\n07:10.500 --> 07:16.500\nSpeaking of unicorns, I'd like to talk about disabled people.\n\n07:16.500 --> 07:36.500\nI was at Communicon today, and there's always, like, my heart always, it kind of fractures a little bit, because there's invariably, if I do, like, a WGA panel or something like that, this doesn't happen enough, but it happens frequently enough that I've marked the memory.\n\n07:36.500 --> 07:48.500\nIt's like, someone in a wheelchair will come up, and they will want to talk about the really conspicuous lack of differently-abled people on television.\n\n07:48.500 --> 08:05.500\nI have an inherent, because I'm a big drunk slob, like, my job is to, like, be a curmudgeon, and I'm not a big fan of the idea of TV characters as ambassadors, you know, but, you know, I think that that's an unavoidable thing,\n\n08:05.500 --> 08:14.500\nand I do think it's notable. I think it's a fucked up thing that when somebody in a wheelchair, you know, rolls into a room, we all have a reaction where we kind of start to treat them like a living ghost,\n\n08:14.500 --> 08:19.500\nbecause we don't, for the best reason, which is we don't want people to feel pain.\n\n08:19.500 --> 08:33.500\nAnd then there's always somebody, there's this wonderful young lady who came up to me as an aspiring writer who was at Communicon, I don't think she made it here to the show, but she was at Communicon, I think her name was Lara.\n\n08:33.500 --> 08:45.500\nAnd she's, you know, I had a long talk with her about this, and I've had this talk before, which is that, you know, I guess the reason I'm bringing this up is because this is a podcast.\n\n08:45.500 --> 08:54.500\nIf you're in a wheelchair and you're out there, unless you're just in one because you think it's comfortable, I'm not talking to you if that's the case.\n\n08:54.500 --> 09:09.500\nYou're weird, yeah, that's weird. If you're differently abled and you are watching television and you're watching all these jagg-offs, walk around, not in wheelchairs,\n\n09:09.500 --> 09:16.500\nand you're waiting for that character to come on screen in a wheelchair, and then they do, and it's like the kid from Glee.\n\n09:16.500 --> 09:31.500\nAnd it leaves you a little empty inside like a Snickers bar. It's packed with peanuts, but it did not satisfy, because ultimately, what is a person that has never come from that point of view going to do?\n\n09:31.500 --> 09:38.500\nWhat is the best job a writer could ever do? The best job they could ever do from the most humanitarian instinct in the world is they're going to write a shitty character.\n\n09:38.500 --> 09:46.500\nThey're going to write the definition of a shitty character. They're going to write a character sitting in a chair with wheels on it that happens to be totally infallible and innocent.\n\n09:46.500 --> 09:56.500\nAnd ultimately, it leaves you continually with sort of a bad taste in your mouth. It's nice to have screen time, but ultimately, kind of part of the problem.\n\n09:56.500 --> 10:09.500\nAnd she actually said that they have a phrase for it among the community. They call it inspiration porn, when there's a character in a wheelchair and they can do anything.\n\n10:09.500 --> 10:20.500\nI remember a different Strokes episode where Arnold made friends with a kid in a wheelchair, and there was the big moment in the different Strokes episode where Arnold said,\n\n10:20.500 --> 10:28.500\nhey, we're having a good time. Come upstairs. I want to show you my goldfish. And he started running halfway up the stairs, and then he turned around.\n\n10:28.500 --> 10:41.500\nAnd he said, oh, oh, God, I forgot. And the kid in his wheelchair at the bottom of the stairs said, Arnold, that's the best thing any of the ones ever said to me.\n\n10:41.500 --> 10:53.500\nAnd that's sort of where we peed. I mean, we haven't really progressed beyond that from the Reagan era in terms of television's treatment of being differently abled.\n\n10:53.500 --> 10:58.500\nWhat kind of sad life did that wheelchair kid have? That's the best thing anyone ever said.\n\n10:58.500 --> 11:03.500\nThat's the best thing that could happen to me is you totally fucking forgot what my actual...\n\n11:03.500 --> 11:12.500\nYeah, but I don't want to throw that under the bus because at least somebody was doing something even at that point.\n\n11:12.500 --> 11:22.500\nI'm bringing this up not because I don't want to talk to my fellow fat white straight male writers that are out there.\n\n11:22.500 --> 11:34.500\nWe'll keep doing what we're doing. But I really... God damn it, if you have the slightest thing wrong with you, start writing. God damn it.\n\n11:34.500 --> 11:43.500\nBecause all of TV is written by people who are just... The career is one of privilege. It takes a support system to pursue a career in writing.\n\n11:43.500 --> 11:55.500\nAnd so if you do find yourself wondering why television stinks for you personally, if you can muster it at all, if you can weather that storm,\n\n11:55.500 --> 12:05.500\nget that script out there, mother. Because once somebody goes to prison and then writes about it, we get to have an orange as the new black\n\n12:05.500 --> 12:11.500\nand we don't have to sit and occupy our minds with questions about whether or not it's authentic and blah, blah, blah.\n\n12:11.500 --> 12:19.500\nAnd progress starts to happen in terms of television. What we really want is just transparency and honesty and stuff.\n\n12:19.500 --> 12:27.500\nI was taken with that most of all. All the Communicon people, my heart goes up and down and go all over the walls.\n\n12:27.500 --> 12:37.500\nYou'll never have such an intense minute with one person as you do and somebody is watching your broadcast network television show.\n\n12:37.500 --> 12:43.500\nThey have one minute to explain to you, my brother committed suicide. This got me through this.\n\n12:43.500 --> 12:49.500\nThese things that aren't meant to be fit into the can of one minute, they have to be. Otherwise, they...\n\n12:49.500 --> 12:52.500\nHow do you deal with that? How do you deal with that? Because that isn't...\n\n12:52.500 --> 13:09.500\nEasy for me. I'm just sitting there going, well, that's great. Sounds like a good job getting over it. Glad I could help. Looks like I nailed it.\n\n13:09.500 --> 13:13.500\nOh, do you want a picture?\n\n13:13.500 --> 13:21.500\nThey're the ones trying to explain to someone. You created something that really meant something to me.\n\n13:21.500 --> 13:31.500\nAnd their bodies tremble and their eyes water and their spines shake because everything's so symbolic.\n\n13:31.500 --> 13:37.500\nI haven't earned that. It has nothing to do with me. It's the show. It's a show that 200 people make over five years.\n\n13:37.500 --> 13:46.500\nIt's something to me and they have that one moment and they vibrate. Their transmission is overwhelmed.\n\n13:46.500 --> 13:55.500\nThey're the ones that have the challenge. I'm just like, Robert Zemeckis going, oh, yeah, the Lurians are great.\n\n13:55.500 --> 14:02.500\nI frankly enjoy it because it would make me feel like a worse person if a line of people came up and said,\n\n14:02.500 --> 14:10.500\nyour job makes me doing nothing worth everything.\n\n14:10.500 --> 14:19.500\nIt's a way for me to trick myself into thinking of being a rich writer, writing an opiate for the masses is actually not what it is.\n\n14:19.500 --> 14:25.500\nBecause someone's going, no, man, my mom left my dad and I was all fucked up and your show helped me.\n\n14:25.500 --> 14:29.500\nI'm like, see, I told you I was a good person.\n\n14:29.500 --> 14:37.500\nI did that with Lou Barlow once. I freaked out and did the transmission breaking down when I got around Lou Barlow in L.A. when I met him\n\n14:37.500 --> 14:45.500\nand it was the most humiliating, mortifying moment in my life because I went to him trying to express this idea that,\n\n14:45.500 --> 14:51.500\noh, fuck your music got me through so much and helped me feel like I wasn't insane.\n\n14:51.500 --> 15:02.500\nAnd it came out like, you're so great, man. And he looked at me like, okay, it was awful because I failed that bad\n\n15:02.500 --> 15:07.500\nand even talking that I embarrassed both of us and it was an awkward moment.\n\n15:07.500 --> 15:11.500\nAnd his friends looked, everyone was like, oh, fuck.\n\n15:11.500 --> 15:17.500\nBut I guess it rains on him like that, like hipsters come up stammering to him nonstop.\n\n15:17.500 --> 15:28.500\nAnd I don't think, assuming Lou Barlow is exactly like me, I would wager that the response under which you're projecting,\n\n15:28.500 --> 15:34.500\noh, I fucked up and you're a jerk, what you're perceiving is them going like,\n\n15:34.500 --> 15:41.500\nI can't do anything with simply the root message that what's happening right now is difficult for you.\n\n15:41.500 --> 15:44.500\nAll I can do is continue to stand by it.\n\n15:44.500 --> 15:49.500\nBecause what would you say if somebody said, this is really difficult for me, I don't know what to do.\n\n15:49.500 --> 15:56.500\nMy Wisconsin fiber will not allow me to say, it's okay, just let it out.\n\n15:56.500 --> 16:02.500\nThere's nothing I can say that won't make me a douche, except so I'll just silence is what you need to do.\n\n16:02.500 --> 16:04.500\nYou just go like, all right, okay.\n\n16:04.500 --> 16:11.500\nBut then I think if you are that nervous as we all have been, if I got in an elevator with Bob Odenkirk or Bill Murray or something,\n\n16:11.500 --> 16:18.500\nlike I have been in this situation, I have made an ass of myself and because I wanted to say so many things,\n\n16:18.500 --> 16:20.500\nI'd have one minute to say them.\n\n16:20.500 --> 16:29.500\nI think that then in those moments, hey, calm down.\n\n16:29.500 --> 16:40.500\nAll right, I'm trying to talk about something.\n\n16:40.500 --> 16:47.500\nOkay, maybe we'll put a pin in what I was discussing.\n\n16:47.500 --> 17:00.500\nBecause a friend of mine thought it might be a good idea to drop by and I said, hey, if you can, poke your head.\n\n17:00.500 --> 17:04.500\nThey have somebody give me the high sign and he just stepped into the spotlight.\n\n17:04.500 --> 17:10.500\nOh, awesome. I didn't know what I was like, oh, if you've been in an elevator with Bob Odenkirk or something,\n\n17:10.500 --> 17:13.500\njust you're like freaking out.\n\n17:13.500 --> 17:15.500\nOh, I get it now.\n\n17:15.500 --> 17:16.500\nCool.\n\n17:16.500 --> 17:45.500\nLet's all get into an elevator right now with Joel McKell.\n\n17:45.500 --> 17:53.500\nYeah, double mic, yeah.\n\n17:53.500 --> 17:55.500\nSay it.\n\n17:55.500 --> 17:57.500\nJoel just worked the room.\n\n17:57.500 --> 17:59.500\nIt's an audio podcast, so I'm doing play by play.\n\n17:59.500 --> 18:01.500\nYou do it, you get on there.\n\n18:01.500 --> 18:04.500\nDanny Pooty, ladies and gentlemen, Danny Pooty.\n\n18:04.500 --> 18:09.500\nDanny Pooty, ladies and gentlemen, Danny Pooty.\n\n18:09.500 --> 18:16.500\nThat's the skinniest hipster here.\n\n18:16.500 --> 18:17.500\nHi.\n\n18:17.500 --> 18:18.500\nHey, how are you?\n\n18:18.500 --> 18:20.500\nSponsored by Kettle, huh? What a surprise.\n\n18:20.500 --> 18:25.500\nI know that you're the sponsor of like a rival vodka company.\n\n18:25.500 --> 18:26.500\nI am.\n\n18:26.500 --> 18:30.500\nSo please rip the labels off of these, my friend.\n\n18:30.500 --> 18:35.500\nYes, Purity Vodka, way better than Kettle Ones.\n\n18:35.500 --> 18:46.500\nIt's from Sweden. Good thing it's not from Germany because it's called Purity.\n\n18:46.500 --> 18:48.500\nDan, I have seen you twice in two weeks.\n\n18:48.500 --> 18:49.500\nI know, it's crazy.\n\n18:49.500 --> 18:50.500\nIt's really weird.\n\n18:50.500 --> 18:52.500\nIt's like we're getting back to work or something.\n\n18:52.500 --> 18:53.500\nHello, Jeff.\n\n18:53.500 --> 18:57.500\nHello, I'm not Jeff.\n\n18:57.500 --> 19:01.500\nThat'd be amazing if Jeff changed into this somehow.\n\n19:01.500 --> 19:05.500\nIt would be a weird turn for him.\n\n19:05.500 --> 19:07.500\nHave you ever met Duncan Tressel?\n\n19:07.500 --> 19:09.500\nHave I ever met Duncan Tressel?\n\n19:09.500 --> 19:13.500\nNo, I saw you at a party, but we never, I don't know.\n\n19:13.500 --> 19:14.500\nAt Dance House?\n\n19:14.500 --> 19:15.500\nYeah, at Dance House.\n\n19:15.500 --> 19:17.500\nOh yeah, we had a great conversation.\n\n19:17.500 --> 19:18.500\nIt was, we didn't.\n\n19:18.500 --> 19:19.500\nNo, I don't remember him at all.\n\n19:19.500 --> 19:21.500\nWe didn't talk.\n\n19:21.500 --> 19:23.500\nYou seemed terrific.\n\n19:23.500 --> 19:24.500\nYou seemed lovely.\n\n19:24.500 --> 19:26.500\nHow was Communicon today, everyone?\n\n19:26.500 --> 19:32.500\nYeah, how'd it go?\n\n19:32.500 --> 19:33.500\nIt was good.\n\n19:33.500 --> 19:36.500\nI talked to a person in a wheelchair.\n\n19:36.500 --> 19:37.500\nOh, sorry.\n\n19:37.500 --> 19:39.500\nI did great.\n\n19:39.500 --> 19:41.500\nNo, no, it's good.\n\n19:41.500 --> 19:42.500\nSorry.\n\n19:42.500 --> 19:50.500\nHow much longer did they have?\n\n19:50.500 --> 19:55.500\nUntil they finished their Modern Family spec, only three weeks.\n\n19:55.500 --> 19:56.500\nShe's out there.\n\n19:56.500 --> 19:58.500\nLara, now the pressure's on.\n\n19:58.500 --> 20:01.500\nAre we going to have a person in a wheelchair for a community?\n\n20:01.500 --> 20:04.500\nThat's what I was talking about right before you came.\n\n20:04.500 --> 20:11.500\nI would like to be the sitcom that does that in a way that doesn't make everyone feel like\n\n20:11.500 --> 20:13.500\na goddamn asshole.\n\n20:13.500 --> 20:18.500\nI hate the fact that, yeah, I don't know.\n\n20:18.500 --> 20:24.500\nWe brainstormed in the room once, we were talking about the Down syndrome thing.\n\n20:24.500 --> 20:25.500\nThere are sitcoms.\n\n20:25.500 --> 20:28.500\nWe've seen characters with Down syndrome come on screen.\n\n20:28.500 --> 20:34.500\nIt's also like, oh, these are some of the most joyful, entertaining people in the world,\n\n20:34.500 --> 20:38.500\nbut there's this social stigma where you feel like if you're laughing because of a person\n\n20:38.500 --> 20:42.500\nwith Down syndrome that you're laughing at them or that you're automatically a bully.\n\n20:42.500 --> 20:46.500\nOne of the most ironic things in the world happens because I don't think it's politically\n\n20:46.500 --> 20:56.500\ncorrect to say that Down syndrome people are generally incredibly joyful people that cause\n\n20:56.500 --> 20:58.500\na lot of mirth in people.\n\n20:58.500 --> 21:02.500\nIt is one of the very positive side effects of it.\n\n21:02.500 --> 21:07.500\nThe people that work with them are the ones that say so, so I am not too worried about\n\n21:07.500 --> 21:15.500\nsaying that.\n\n21:15.500 --> 21:21.500\nWhen you see them on TV, again, it's like, okay, clear the runway, let's all be cool,\n\n21:21.500 --> 21:24.500\nthe president's in town, let's cool it.\n\n21:24.500 --> 21:30.500\nThe question becomes like, how would 30 Rock have a Down syndrome character and not be\n\n21:30.500 --> 21:32.500\npandering and stuff like that?\n\n21:32.500 --> 21:38.500\nWe had talked in the writer's room, a community about what would it be?\n\n21:38.500 --> 21:41.500\nWhat if you made them a huge asshole?\n\n21:41.500 --> 21:46.500\nWhat we were going to do was create a character named Michael who was just the guy that he\n\n21:46.500 --> 21:52.500\ncomes in and every time the dean wants to tell everybody something shitty, he sends\n\n21:52.500 --> 21:59.500\nMichael.\n\n21:59.500 --> 22:05.500\nSo Michael comes in and it's just like if the teacher's salaries are getting lowered,\n\n22:05.500 --> 22:07.500\nthe lunch menu is gone.\n\n22:07.500 --> 22:09.500\nPlease tell me you'll do that.\n\n22:09.500 --> 22:12.500\nHow often do you say things here that actually wind up there?\n\n22:12.500 --> 22:15.500\nPlenty.\n\n22:15.500 --> 22:17.500\nThat would be great.\n\n22:17.500 --> 22:20.500\nThat was a good market test.\n\n22:20.500 --> 22:22.500\nThey responded well to that.\n\n22:22.500 --> 22:24.500\nI feel like that way it's like everyone's in on the joke.\n\n22:24.500 --> 22:26.500\nNobody's even being made fun of.\n\n22:26.500 --> 22:31.500\nIt's like the joke becomes how society perceives and what all society is kind of strange,\n\n22:31.500 --> 22:33.500\ncatechesis and things.\n\n22:33.500 --> 22:39.500\nAlso how do you do that with people who are physically differently able?\n\n22:39.500 --> 22:41.500\nHave you seen the New American Horror Story?\n\n22:41.500 --> 22:42.500\nNo.\n\n22:42.500 --> 22:44.500\nIt's amazing.\n\n22:44.500 --> 22:46.500\nJessica Lange is so strange.\n\n22:46.500 --> 22:48.500\nIs that what you're talking about?\n\n22:48.500 --> 22:50.500\nNo, but it is super cool.\n\n22:50.500 --> 22:55.500\nThey use people who have actual disabilities and it's amazing.\n\n22:55.500 --> 22:57.500\nIt doesn't seem exploitive at all.\n\n22:57.500 --> 22:59.500\nYeah, Chevy's on the show.\n\n22:59.500 --> 23:05.500\nYou're right. Too soon.\n\n23:05.500 --> 23:10.500\nI mean, within three years it'll be too late.\n\n23:10.500 --> 23:15.500\nNow is the time to make these jokes, people.\n\n23:15.500 --> 23:19.500\nChevy would appreciate these jokes, believe me.\n\n23:19.500 --> 23:21.500\nHe would love these jokes.\n\n23:21.500 --> 23:24.500\nHe would be the first to be laughing at them.\n\n23:24.500 --> 23:30.500\nAnd by laughing, I mean, you know, calling us fat queers.\n\n23:30.500 --> 23:33.500\nIt is his way of responding positively to us.\n\n23:33.500 --> 23:35.500\nThe term of affection.\n\n23:35.500 --> 23:38.500\nThat was his Christmas card.\n\n23:38.500 --> 23:41.500\nI love you, you fat queer.\n\n23:41.500 --> 23:43.500\nChevy.\n\n23:43.500 --> 23:47.500\nSo what have you been up to between, during community's death?\n\n23:47.500 --> 23:51.500\nHow did you spend your Easter?\n\n23:51.500 --> 23:56.500\nWell, I saw my grandma.\n\n23:56.500 --> 23:58.500\nShe's 95.\n\n23:58.500 --> 24:01.500\nI did a lot. She's great. She's racist.\n\n24:01.500 --> 24:04.500\nBut she has to be.\n\n24:04.500 --> 24:06.500\nIf she wasn't, then...\n\n24:06.500 --> 24:08.500\nNo, my grandma will...\n\n24:08.500 --> 24:10.500\nThis is my 95-year-old grandma.\n\n24:10.500 --> 24:14.500\nShe will go, why do you have to say fuck so much?\n\n24:14.500 --> 24:17.500\nAnd I was like, I just fucking have to, grandma?\n\n24:17.500 --> 24:21.500\nI don't know. I think I'm sure you've told the story a million times,\n\n24:21.500 --> 24:25.500\nbut we didn't know it was going to be picked up until the last hour.\n\n24:25.500 --> 24:30.500\nIt was like at 4.30 in the afternoon on the last half hour of the contracts\n\n24:30.500 --> 24:36.500\nwhere they went, Yahoo has bought the show with peltz, not with cash.\n\n24:36.500 --> 24:40.500\nThey use beaver peltz.\n\n24:40.500 --> 24:42.500\nYeah, it was weird that...\n\n24:42.500 --> 24:44.500\nAnd Sony's like, great, we're doing it.\n\n24:44.500 --> 24:50.500\nSo I bought a house, so I've been doing a lot of stand-up to pay for that.\n\n24:50.500 --> 24:54.500\nSeeing my children, I have a 9- and 6-year-old.\n\n24:54.500 --> 24:56.500\nYeah, weird.\n\n24:56.500 --> 25:00.500\nThat doesn't deserve clapping.\n\n25:00.500 --> 25:02.500\nYou can actually be a terrible parent for 9 years,\n\n25:02.500 --> 25:04.500\nand you'll still have a 9-year-old child.\n\n25:04.500 --> 25:06.500\nThanks, yeah, you're right.\n\n25:06.500 --> 25:08.500\nIt's been done all over the world.\n\n25:08.500 --> 25:11.500\nI have a baby, I just shook it for hours.\n\n25:11.500 --> 25:13.500\nI shook it for 9 years.\n\n25:13.500 --> 25:15.500\nI was shaking 9-year-old child.\n\n25:15.500 --> 25:18.500\nSame results.\n\n25:18.500 --> 25:21.500\nBut we went to dinner two nights ago, three nights ago.\n\n25:21.500 --> 25:23.500\nYeah, we had terrible octopus.\n\n25:23.500 --> 25:25.500\nTerrible octopus, but everything else was terrific.\n\n25:25.500 --> 25:26.500\nYeah, man.\n\n25:26.500 --> 25:30.500\nOh, did you guys hear about the family that ate puffer fish?\n\n25:30.500 --> 25:32.500\nDid you hear about this?\n\n25:32.500 --> 25:33.500\nIt's terrible.\n\n25:33.500 --> 25:36.500\nThis family had puffer fish,\n\n25:36.500 --> 25:40.500\nand you have to train as a chef for two years to serve this stuff.\n\n25:40.500 --> 25:43.500\nBut it's a very sad story, like their uncle caught it,\n\n25:43.500 --> 25:46.500\nand they're disgusting-looking fish,\n\n25:46.500 --> 25:48.500\nbut the family, someone's like, it looked delicious.\n\n25:48.500 --> 25:51.500\nIt seemed like it'd be amazing, but they ate it,\n\n25:51.500 --> 25:54.500\nand within five minutes, all of them were paralyzed\n\n25:54.500 --> 25:57.500\nand having seizures, and they're all in the hospital now.\n\n25:57.500 --> 26:03.500\nSo octopus, I don't know, made me think of deadly puffer fish.\n\n26:03.500 --> 26:05.500\nI went through a day where I was like,\n\n26:05.500 --> 26:08.500\nwait a minute, puffer fish, blowfish, what's going on?\n\n26:08.500 --> 26:10.500\nWhat is the thing that I looked into?\n\n26:10.500 --> 26:12.500\nIt's like puffer fish and blowfish, it's kind of like,\n\n26:12.500 --> 26:14.500\nit's all part of the same thing.\n\n26:14.500 --> 26:15.500\nI think it's the same.\n\n26:15.500 --> 26:17.500\nYeah, I just remember that Simpsons episode.\n\n26:17.500 --> 26:21.500\nBasically, there's like a whole kind of family of fish,\n\n26:21.500 --> 26:24.500\nall of whom puff up as a defense mechanism,\n\n26:24.500 --> 26:26.500\nand all of whom are deadly poisonous.\n\n26:26.500 --> 26:29.500\nAnd apparently incredibly delicious,\n\n26:29.500 --> 26:31.500\nthat people keep trying to eat them.\n\n26:31.500 --> 26:34.500\nI read a thing where the puffer fish poisoned it.\n\n26:34.500 --> 26:36.500\nIf you cut the fish correctly,\n\n26:36.500 --> 26:39.500\nit just tingles the edge of your lips and your mouth,\n\n26:39.500 --> 26:42.500\nand if it's cut right, you swallow it and you're fine.\n\n26:42.500 --> 26:43.500\nOh, who fucking cares?\n\n26:43.500 --> 26:44.500\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n26:44.500 --> 26:46.500\nThere's nothing, there's nothing that's,\n\n26:46.500 --> 26:48.500\nthere's no way there's nothing that's worth that.\n\n26:48.500 --> 26:49.500\nThere's no way.\n\n26:49.500 --> 26:50.500\nNothing tastes that good.\n\n26:50.500 --> 26:52.500\nNothing tastes that good.\n\n26:52.500 --> 26:55.500\nLike the, there's that thing where you eat the,\n\n26:55.500 --> 26:58.500\nyou eat the partially fertilized bird egg,\n\n26:58.500 --> 27:02.500\nthe rich people, and then the baby bird bones,\n\n27:02.500 --> 27:05.500\nthe baby bird bones cut your mouth,\n\n27:05.500 --> 27:08.500\nand your own blood is the, is the,\n\n27:08.500 --> 27:10.500\nis part of the delicacy.\n\n27:10.500 --> 27:12.500\nThat is so stupid.\n\n27:12.500 --> 27:15.500\nOr like the cat poop coffee,\n\n27:15.500 --> 27:19.500\nwhere the cat or the, some sort of animal eats the coffee beans,\n\n27:19.500 --> 27:21.500\nit poops it out, and then that is your coffee.\n\n27:21.500 --> 27:22.500\nI've had that.\n\n27:22.500 --> 27:24.500\nYou've had, you're, see, but you're like,\n\n27:24.500 --> 27:25.500\nyou're an idiot, right?\n\n27:25.500 --> 27:30.500\nFor, you, you ate something that's something shit.\n\n27:30.500 --> 27:31.500\nWell, and you were like,\n\n27:31.500 --> 27:34.500\nYou'd be surprised, you'd be surprised.\n\n27:34.500 --> 27:36.500\nIt's not much of an idiot I am.\n\n27:36.500 --> 27:40.500\nNo, it, if someone offers you this rare coffee,\n\n27:40.500 --> 27:42.500\neven if it's been shit out,\n\n27:42.500 --> 27:44.500\nit's, I think it's weasels that eat it actually,\n\n27:44.500 --> 27:46.500\nbut if someone offers you coffee beans\n\n27:46.500 --> 27:50.500\nthat have been shit out of rare weasels,\n\n27:50.500 --> 27:53.500\nyou drink it, Joe, you drink it.\n\n27:53.500 --> 27:56.500\nNo, that common weasel coffee is this, right?\n\n27:56.500 --> 27:58.500\nRare weasels.\n\n27:58.500 --> 28:00.500\nBy the way, it just tastes like coffee.\n\n28:00.500 --> 28:03.500\nIt actually tastes like chicken coffee.\n\n28:03.500 --> 28:05.500\nThat's it.\n\n28:05.500 --> 28:08.500\nI feel like if anyone said this is very rare,\n\n28:08.500 --> 28:11.500\nand, and I'm like waiting for the next thing,\n\n28:11.500 --> 28:14.500\nand there's like, it was shit out of a weasel,\n\n28:14.500 --> 28:17.500\nI would go like, I'm good, I don't need,\n\n28:17.500 --> 28:19.500\nyou gotta live a little, man.\n\n28:19.500 --> 28:21.500\nAnd I, if Dan will attest,\n\n28:21.500 --> 28:23.500\nI'll eat, I'll eat almost anything,\n\n28:23.500 --> 28:26.500\nbut, but not that, but that's great.\n\n28:26.500 --> 28:28.500\nBut you have your hipster beer and your friends\n\n28:28.500 --> 28:32.500\nand all that, and I can't compete with that.\n\n28:32.500 --> 28:34.500\nNo, no, infighting in Harmontown.\n\n28:34.500 --> 28:37.500\nWe're all, we're all, we're all, we're all, what?\n\n28:41.500 --> 28:44.500\nYou just became the greatest politician of all time.\n\n28:44.500 --> 28:46.500\nBecause we were infighting, we're like,\n\n28:46.500 --> 28:48.500\nwhat's he gonna say? We're all distracted.\n\n28:52.500 --> 28:54.500\nI forgot what we were fighting about.\n\n28:54.500 --> 28:56.500\nDrone strike.\n\n28:56.500 --> 28:58.500\nWell, you weren't looking.\n\n28:58.500 --> 29:00.500\nDrone strikes for everybody.\n\n29:00.500 --> 29:02.500\nHave you been watching,\n\n29:02.500 --> 29:05.500\nI have been watching The Nick since I,\n\n29:05.500 --> 29:07.500\nsince the show was picked up.\n\n29:07.500 --> 29:09.500\nYou've watched The Nick?

I was starving. I couldn't I was too hungry to get to sleep\n\n47:28.260 --> 47:33.660\nSo I was uh, I was reduced to eating the apple I used as a pipe in the hotel\n\n47:33.660 --> 47:41.180\nThat's the original Thanksgiving, isn't it?\n\n47:45.660 --> 47:49.920\nIt was it was delicious though. No, it wasn't it was a green apple. Those are the worst\n\n47:51.220 --> 47:54.100\nWas it was a man Apple enthusiasts\n\n47:55.140 --> 48:03.180\nYou just got booed for saying green apples. Okay. What's the worst the red red delicious or those Washington red are worse than green apples\n\n48:03.180 --> 48:06.120\nBut other than that you I'm from Washington. It's a\n\n48:06.740 --> 48:13.560\nWell, I don't think Washington ruined their apples. I think other people intervened. I agree. I retract\n\n48:14.820 --> 48:20.820\nBut I'm curious what was gross about the was it that it was a green apple or was it that was it its use of a\n\n48:20.820 --> 48:24.340\nAs a pipe that made it. No, that made it great. Oh, okay\n\n48:24.740 --> 48:30.480\nThat's what I was curious about. No, I couldn't I couldn't tell you you would never tell someone smoked out of it other than the\n\n48:30.480 --> 48:33.440\nThe the blackened charred holes in the science\n\n48:34.640 --> 48:39.640\nBut no, it was it was a green apples are gross and they have thick skin. I hate apples. I think\n\n48:41.480 --> 48:44.200\nOranges are better if I were to have to compare the two\n\n48:46.240 --> 48:51.240\nYeah, but an orange pie an orange pipe doesn't seem like it would well you'd be surprised\n\n48:51.240 --> 48:57.440\nBut when we were in San Francisco, I I did not have access to an apple. So I hit up a 7-eleven and got other fruits\n\n48:57.440 --> 49:02.120\nNamely a banana and a lime and a lime worked a lot better\n\n49:02.120 --> 49:09.080\nWhy don't you buy some rolling papers? I my hands get too sweaty and it literally disintegrates the the paper as I roll it\n\n49:09.080 --> 49:11.380\nAnd then I just have a pants full of weed\n\n49:17.840 --> 49:22.960\nGod damn it. No, I forgot what I was gonna ask. Oh, sorry. No, it's not your fault. I feel like it was\n\n49:22.960 --> 49:27.520\nUh, no, hey, that's cuz your brain dead you shithead.

Let's see what he has\n\n50:07.040 --> 50:09.480\nSorry, I want to plug something real quick\n\n50:09.480 --> 50:15.600\nI think the next episode that airs of Brooklyn Nine-Nine unless they added me out.

Yeah, I think so especially when you hit him ten damage and it catches fire\n\n01:42:27.340 --> 01:42:33.620\nRhino meat for everybody however the fire it burns out the vines and it becomes unintentioned\n\n01:42:34.700 --> 01:42:36.980\nShit sorry. It's cool\n\n01:42:38.180 --> 01:42:41.900\nIt struggles to its feet and starts crashing into the cavern walls\n\n01:42:41.900 --> 01:42:50.020\nIt starts sending rocks and then sand and dirt coming down from the ceiling above. It's it's getting kind of dangerous\n\n01:42:50.900 --> 01:42:54.260\nBut you aren't attacked by it because it's all to keep warm\n\n01:42:55.260 --> 01:42:58.340\nIt's all because you decided to do stuff to rhinos. I mean\n\n01:43:00.740 --> 01:43:06.420\nWe could have walked past them and hoped to come to it like a coke factory or you could have crept up on them and slit\n\n01:43:06.420 --> 01:43:11.580\nTheir throats. I mean, there's a lot of factory right over on the other side of the rhinos\n\n01:43:16.020 --> 01:43:18.020\nOkay, dude, I think that\n\n01:43:18.460 --> 01:43:22.580\nMorene is the only person that could cast resist elements and she's dead\n\n01:43:23.500 --> 01:43:26.900\nWhat do you guys want to do? Should we kill this rhino? I think we have\n\n01:43:28.660 --> 01:43:30.660\nWhat Tourette's I\n\n01:43:30.660 --> 01:43:32.660\nI\n\n01:43:35.740 --> 01:43:40.900\nOkay, I'm gonna who's who's up next whoever goes first I have chains\n\n01:43:40.900 --> 01:43:46.940\nI use the I throw my chains around the rhinos legs to try to snare it\n\n01:43:48.420 --> 01:43:52.740\nAll right, the rampaging rhino is too wild to get your chains in it\n\n01:43:53.620 --> 01:43:59.940\nSorry, I would have shocking grasp. I hear the kids. I got I'm a slave to the streets\n\n01:43:59.940 --> 01:44:01.940\nI will give them what they want\n\n01:44:01.980 --> 01:44:06.080\nIt's part of the urban culture. I will do shocking grasp on the rhino\n\n01:44:09.060 --> 01:44:14.060\nStriking the rhino with a lightning infuse the grap grasping motion\n\n01:44:15.220 --> 01:44:21.020\nWhat are you doing to my mind? It looks like having sex with a shocking the rhino. Yeah\n\n01:44:23.100 --> 01:44:25.380\nIt takes 25 lightning\n\n01:44:25.380 --> 01:44:27.380\nYeah\n\n01:44:28.900 --> 01:44:34.620\nWe're saved we are saved and it falls to the ground stunned it's not dead\n\n01:44:34.620 --> 01:44:36.820\nBut it's definitely I walk up and stab it in the throat\n\n01:44:37.260 --> 01:44:42.900\nWait, can I talk to it? I'm gonna talk to it. Well, which do you do first? I speak rhino to it\n\n01:44:42.900 --> 01:44:47.100\nNo, you don't speak rhino. Oh, yeah, you don't sorry. I had to make sure\n\n01:44:48.660 --> 01:44:52.580\nFirst thought best thought stab it at the foot. I stab it in the throat\n\n01:44:52.580 --> 01:44:59.580\nAnd I yeah, and then I try to saw its head off and then I want to wear the head\n\n01:45:02.340 --> 01:45:04.340\nWait, wait, I stop him\n\n01:45:05.300 --> 01:45:07.300\nLet it piss on us first\n\n01:45:08.020 --> 01:45:14.140\nIt's not he didn't say it was pissing. We're not gonna wait around for that. All right. We are dude\n\n01:45:14.140 --> 01:45:20.140\nWe are people I guess I'm fine in this cave. You already unleashed a cold storm onto the thing. We're freezing fine\n\n01:45:20.140 --> 01:45:27.460\nThat's true. You guys are pretty chilly, but you find it rather easy to stab the stunned beast in the throat and saw off\n\n01:45:27.460 --> 01:45:29.460\nIt's head and wear it on your head\n\n01:45:32.860 --> 01:45:38.380\nIt's a look that you definitely can pull off and now I'm gonna sing something by black Sabbath. I'm not sure what\n\n01:45:39.300 --> 01:45:41.300\nJust about no\n\n01:45:41.300 --> 01:45:50.300\nBlack Sabbath song black Sabbath is the best man ever. No, it's been a hard year for black Sabbath as if I were Elvis Costello\n\n01:45:50.300 --> 01:45:52.300\nI'm gonna sing about black Sabbath\n\n01:45:56.380 --> 01:46:02.380\nDead rhino. All right, we got we got one dead right. You know what they say. Yep one dead rhino\n\n01:46:03.300 --> 01:46:05.300\nIt's better than albino\n\n01:46:05.300 --> 01:46:13.980\nYeah, I have a skinning knife. You sure do. I start skinning this rhino. All right, you\n\n01:46:15.420 --> 01:46:19.420\nYeah, it's easy enough you skin it. I'll go get the other rhino guys\n\n01:46:21.260 --> 01:46:26.180\nAnd I trot off like a like a breathless Hillary Swank in an action film\n\n01:46:26.180 --> 01:46:31.380\nLet's just somebody wear the rhino and let's get on with this thing. We've got what we got to move on with them\n\n01:46:31.380 --> 01:46:36.820\nWhat is our point of all of this? What's the point? Where are we going? Fornheim the frozen city?\n\n01:46:37.300 --> 01:46:43.700\nWe're gonna freeze to death is the thing. We got rhinos. We killed they're not gonna make us warmer. I guess\n\n01:46:44.140 --> 01:46:47.180\nDo you think we could make warmth out of rhinos?\n\n01:46:47.860 --> 01:46:51.980\nYeah, I don't help a little bit. I mean maybe stuff some like hay in there\n\n01:46:51.980 --> 01:46:58.420\nOh, is there hay around not in the cave, but maybe somewhere or dried leaves. I know I don't know cardboard\n\n01:46:58.420 --> 01:47:06.020\nNewspapers I run off where the other papers and cardboard in D&D. No, I'm sorry. I was I was being a\n\n01:47:06.580 --> 01:47:08.580\nWord I'm in pursuit of the other rhino\n\n01:47:09.100 --> 01:47:15.700\nYeah, you are you step out of the cave into a into a similar graveyard in the forest\n\n01:47:15.700 --> 01:47:20.120\nIt's a nice little graveyard with probably less than 30 graves in it\n\n01:47:20.120 --> 01:47:27.880\nYou can see that several of the graves are just devastated and a large portion of the fence has been dismantled as if a rhino had charged through it\n\n01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:34.440\nAre there are there are there corpses or bodies in the devastated graves? Uh-huh\n\n01:47:36.280 --> 01:47:42.640\nProbably I mean wearing clothes. Do they have maybe we could wear the corpse clothes to keep warm little\n\n01:47:43.160 --> 01:47:45.160\nI don't want to smell that bad\n\n01:47:45.160 --> 01:47:52.400\nLittle Baskins. Hey guys, I'm little Baskins. You're dead. What do you make of this cemetery? It's uh\n\n01:47:53.640 --> 01:47:55.640\nRight, I feel right at home\n\n01:47:56.800 --> 01:48:00.040\nAre you gonna be offended if we desecrate these graves look for fur coats?\n\n01:48:00.800 --> 01:48:05.240\nWell, it looks like those guys are right ahead of you in the corner of the graveyard\n\n01:48:05.240 --> 01:48:11.240\nYou see two dark figures that are hunched over they look like they're digging digging for something grave robbers\n\n01:48:11.240 --> 01:48:13.840\nYou didn't see him before because a rhino devastation\n\n01:48:13.840 --> 01:48:21.000\nThe two forms stand up they reveal themselves to be gnolls and they're like, oh shit. You are here fast\n\n01:48:22.880 --> 01:48:24.880\nWe fuck\n\n01:48:30.240 --> 01:48:33.200\nYou identify yourselves\n\n01:48:34.160 --> 01:48:37.000\nYou you bastards I will not do that\n\n01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:45.000\nDon't you don't you remember when you killed our brother our brother Yerch in cold blood?\n\n01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000\nAnd we swore vengeance\n\n01:48:48.640 --> 01:48:50.640\nThis is that bitch\n\n01:48:51.320 --> 01:48:56.600\nThis is your vengeance. Oh, yeah running into you in a well cemetery\n\n01:48:56.600 --> 01:49:01.920\nYeah, we're a bit late for our vengeance and remember that and then remember the time we got vengeance on that one guy\n\n01:49:01.920 --> 01:49:09.480\nBy digging and hoping he would come near us. My friend has a point your vengeance is lame\n\n01:49:12.360 --> 01:49:16.360\nWell, why are we how are we seeking vengeance just keep digging he's gonna show up\n\n01:49:16.360 --> 01:49:21.240\nLet's go to a remote location and dig and then the vengeance will come up out of a box\n\n01:49:21.240 --> 01:49:26.480\nIt doesn't work. We're gonna lay a sprinkling pipe and where's vengeance ever the the smaller of the two knolls\n\n01:49:26.640 --> 01:49:30.880\nSpreads his arm out and you see black lightning bolts surge into the earth below\n\n01:49:30.880 --> 01:49:38.960\nAnd then you hear a rumbling almost as if the ground is moving and several bony arms burst out of the soil and start to\n\n01:49:39.040 --> 01:49:44.960\nPull themselves out to their feet. Oops. I pull out my hole. I have a hole. I pull out my holy symbol\n\n01:49:44.960 --> 01:49:48.840\nI have a holy symbol. Oh shit. You don't talk about your dick, bro. I\n\n01:49:50.560 --> 01:49:52.560\nPull out my cock\n\n01:49:54.160 --> 01:49:57.760\nNo, I'm not Chris de Burgh. No, it's not his\n\n01:49:57.760 --> 01:50:00.400\nQuark doesn't have a dick anymore either\n\n01:50:01.080 --> 01:50:07.400\nHe has so two guys two people in this group. Yes, someone else's cock. He pulls it out\n\n01:50:08.040 --> 01:50:11.600\nHoly shit. Yeah, there's one cock left in the party\n\n01:50:13.440 --> 01:50:19.520\nBecause Chris de Burgh cut his own penis off in an earlier episode. Yeah, it was awesome when I did that it was necessary\n\n01:50:19.680 --> 01:50:23.600\nAnd I'm fine. It's gonna grow back. I'm a fucking salamander. All right\n\n01:50:23.600 --> 01:50:33.240\nIt takes a while. What do we kill these dead people, please? Yeah, do something you can you from Liverpool?\n\n01:50:36.200 --> 01:50:38.760\nAll right, she she mumbles nothing\n\n01:50:39.800 --> 01:50:43.840\nShe makes a high-pitched mumble. Does that work? It's super effective\n\n01:50:44.880 --> 01:50:51.360\nNo, no, I'm sorry. That doesn't work. I look at these gnolls and I say y'all using blood magic\n\n01:50:51.360 --> 01:50:55.200\nNot yet, bitch, but I'm about to he\n\n01:50:56.000 --> 01:51:00.080\nSlashes his thumb open and smears it across the scroll and holds it above his head\n\n01:51:00.080 --> 01:51:07.560\nAnd you see a swirling torrent of blood come out of the scroll and surround these skeletal zombies and engulfing their forms and sticky\n\n01:51:07.880 --> 01:51:10.240\nCoagulated blood. Oh, all right anything else\n\n01:51:11.680 --> 01:51:13.680\nHe pulls out a shotgun, okay\n\n01:51:15.240 --> 01:51:17.400\nI just want to know thank you\n\n01:51:17.400 --> 01:51:22.640\nAll right, we should stop there. We got a big fight coming up with some skeletons. We're gonna stop Dungeons & Dragons there\n\n01:51:23.160 --> 01:51:28.160\nThat's the that's the end of the show. Hold on. What what what all we did?\n\n01:51:29.320 --> 01:51:36.200\nYeah, let's kill one of two rhinos for no reason welcome welcome and we were cold\n\n01:51:36.320 --> 01:51:40.720\nWe accomplished more in this session than we've ever accomplished in G&D ever\n\n01:51:40.720 --> 01:51:45.760\nThat's like Joel McHale for coming by\n\n01:51:48.120 --> 01:51:52.000\nGuest Comptroller Duncan Trussell Daniel from Liverpool\n\n01:51:53.680 --> 01:51:55.680\nAs always\n\n01:51:56.800 --> 01:52:03.000\nThe nerd melt theater Dustin Marshall back there and Zach working audio Spencer crittin's in the dungeon\n\n01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:10.280\nMaybe go figure out a way to download the yahoo screen app back\n\n01:52:10.680 --> 01:52:15.600\nDownload the yahoo screen app, but if you already have within months, it could become totally relevant\n\n01:52:16.320 --> 01:52:20.520\nAnd thank you guys from Communicon for coming and blessing us\n\n01:52:20.520 --> 01:52:30.520\nAnd we will see you in season six and then a movie and then beyond.
