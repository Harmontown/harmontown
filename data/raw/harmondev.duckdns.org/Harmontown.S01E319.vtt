WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:10.720
From downtown Los Angeles, or, downtown Los, pardon me, I got a frog in my throat.

00:10.720 --> 00:18.440
From downtown Los Angeles, Harvintown is once again in session.

00:18.440 --> 00:20.960
Don't think of it as losing a Spencer.

00:20.960 --> 00:25.960
Think of it as gaining a Rob Schrab.

00:25.960 --> 00:43.960
Let's bring out the mayor of Harvintown, you know him, if you like him, his name is Dan Harmon.

00:43.960 --> 00:55.680
Thank you, thank you for coming, my name is Mr. Drummond, I got a different stroke for

00:55.680 --> 01:00.400
you, it's called fucking in your mama, what you gonna do, all right, come on.

01:00.400 --> 01:10.520
My future mother-in-law's here tonight, let's not wrap about fucking people's mamas.

01:10.520 --> 01:12.440
The marriage is on, it's happened.

01:12.440 --> 01:15.080
I get my ring, it get resized.

01:15.080 --> 01:23.080
My fiance, she sneakily behind my back, there's always a challenge, like how do you know

01:23.080 --> 01:29.240
their ring size, well, if they're divorced, you get the last ring, which I had already

01:29.240 --> 01:36.800
thrown into the cracks of doom as I was told to do by Gandalf, but it was not unmade there.

01:36.800 --> 01:44.000
No, Levy conspired behind my back, they had my old wedding ring, but marriage either makes

01:44.000 --> 01:52.000
your knuckles bigger, like you flex your wedding, it didn't fit, it was too tight, I don't know

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
what happened.

01:53.000 --> 01:58.000
I hope it's muscle, I hope I gained muscle, but I needed it to be whitened.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.200
You got that Dave Kline finger muscle going on there.

02:00.200 --> 02:06.800
Yeah, I think that's what it was, anyways, it's on my finger now, it's only mildly distracting,

02:06.800 --> 02:13.000
I twist it and I play with it and I'll never take it off.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
Aw.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
Gross.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
Oh, hi Rob.

02:17.000 --> 02:23.920
I haven't seen you in months.

02:23.920 --> 02:24.920
How are you?

02:24.920 --> 02:25.920
I'm fine.

02:25.920 --> 02:28.280
Why haven't you been on the show lately?

02:28.280 --> 02:31.240
I don't know, when was the last time you asked me to come on?

02:31.240 --> 02:33.240
Are people supposed to invite you every week?

02:33.240 --> 02:34.240
Like yeah.

02:34.240 --> 02:36.240
Do it now.

02:36.240 --> 02:40.840
Well, come every week.

02:40.840 --> 02:41.840
Alright.

02:41.840 --> 02:43.360
Can I just say that once?

02:43.360 --> 02:44.360
You just did, yes.

02:44.360 --> 02:46.680
Okay, well, I've said it before.

02:46.680 --> 02:48.920
Again, what time?

02:48.920 --> 02:57.280
This is Schrab backstage, right before we came on stage, this is to Cody, he's like, what's

02:57.280 --> 02:59.440
that, let me get that.

02:59.440 --> 03:06.240
Oh, shit, that was too much, too much.

03:06.240 --> 03:07.740
So keep your eye on him.

03:07.740 --> 03:12.280
Terrible impression of me, I don't act like that.

03:12.280 --> 03:16.400
I only have one thing to talk about and then we'll bring up our guests.

03:16.400 --> 03:22.000
Tonight's an emotionally complicated night, so like run out and scalp your tickets while

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
you can.

03:23.000 --> 03:32.480
It's an emotionally complicated night, 9-1-1 operators, I'm a true crime podcast listener,

03:32.480 --> 03:45.240
we have a 9-1-1 operator, okay, you're like, my favorite topic too, I just don't, you

03:45.240 --> 03:51.760
don't listen to true crime podcasts, like, Jeff, call me with an emergency.

03:51.760 --> 03:52.760
Hello?

03:52.760 --> 03:57.760
9-1-1, what's your emergency?

03:57.760 --> 04:03.760
Sir, you need to calm down, just tell me what's going on.

04:03.760 --> 04:05.520
I think there's a burglar downstairs.

04:05.520 --> 04:10.600
Sir, I understand, but you need to calm down, hold on, 9-1-1, what's your emergency?

04:10.600 --> 04:12.720
Hey, I'm burgling in his house.

04:12.720 --> 04:14.760
Sir, you need to calm down.

04:14.760 --> 04:23.000
Hey, I'm going to burgle your house after I get done here.

04:23.000 --> 04:28.760
My bit's been superseded by a more, a much more interesting bit that I'd rather do, but

04:28.760 --> 04:36.120
I don't know what to, sir, you need to give me the candelabra, okay, okay, can you hold?

04:36.120 --> 04:37.120
No problem.

04:37.120 --> 04:38.120
Sir?

04:38.120 --> 04:40.040
Yeah, are you talking to my burglar right now?

04:40.040 --> 04:41.320
Sir, you need to, you need-

04:41.320 --> 04:43.600
Hey, I'm burgling for you, I'm in the other room.

04:43.600 --> 04:48.120
Yeah, but can I get a word in edgewise with my 9-1-1 dispatch?

04:48.120 --> 04:52.280
Sir, you need to turn your radio down.

04:52.280 --> 04:53.280
What?

04:53.280 --> 04:57.360
I'm not calling it on a radio show, I'm calling it on a radio show.

04:57.360 --> 05:00.640
That was always the thing, millennials probably don't know about that, because it was like,

05:00.640 --> 05:06.120
the radio, all like local radio, they're like, all right, it's about five o'clock, we're

05:06.120 --> 05:09.360
playing all the hits of the alchemy that's coming up, what do you want?

05:09.360 --> 05:13.440
And it would be like nine times out of ten, it'd be like, hey, hey, my name's Dave J.

05:13.440 --> 05:14.440
What are you doing?

05:14.440 --> 05:20.160
You gotta turn that radio down, I know it's exciting to be on the radio, but if it's

05:20.160 --> 05:24.920
on, well, you're on the phone, then the radio's gonna go into this microphone or the phone

05:24.920 --> 05:28.120
and then we're gonna be listening to you, listening to you.

05:28.120 --> 05:33.880
It's a tough thing to, it's kind of a Christopher Nolan thing, but you gotta fucking figure

05:33.880 --> 05:39.800
it out, be a professional, mute that radio, talk to us as if we're no big deal and then

05:39.800 --> 05:42.440
you'll sound good for everybody else.

05:42.440 --> 05:44.680
This guy's burglarizing my home right now.

05:44.680 --> 05:47.640
Sir, I need you to calm down.

05:47.640 --> 05:55.080
I'm fucking, you seem more stressed out than I am, I'm in my closet hiding, I have a weapon.

05:55.080 --> 06:03.000
If you listen to True Crime Podcast for a year, I now feel like if something happens

06:03.000 --> 06:09.800
to me, if I come home and Cody has lost an arm, I'm gonna try to figure out, I'm gonna

06:09.800 --> 06:17.840
Google what to do if you lose an arm before calling 911 because I don't wanna end up having

06:17.840 --> 06:24.520
the recording of me pondered over, but I feel like, oh, he doesn't sound very upset.

06:24.520 --> 06:31.760
I think he cut off her arm, but if you call them and go like, oh my god, oh my god, my

06:31.760 --> 06:38.040
girlfriend's arm got cut off, they're like, sir, sir, sir, calm down.

06:38.040 --> 06:40.040
What's your address?

06:40.040 --> 06:46.960
Oh my god, it's one, two, three, four on the fiction street, I don't know, sir, sir.

06:46.960 --> 06:49.680
Why are you still chastising me?

06:49.680 --> 06:53.520
After the point where you get the address and your ambulance is on the way, can I have

06:53.520 --> 07:01.000
permission to freak out about the dead body I found and or do I have your permission to

07:01.000 --> 07:05.720
be enough on the spectrum that the one thing I'm good at is calling 911?

07:05.720 --> 07:11.840
I'm so sick of this fucking, oh, he's like, listen to this 911 call, and it just seems

07:11.840 --> 07:20.840
a little weird, hello, 911, yeah, my children are missing, your children are missing, yeah,

07:20.840 --> 07:26.120
they're missing and it's noon now and I haven't seen them since 1130 and then it's just like

07:26.120 --> 07:32.960
going, oh, he sounds like a robot, oh, he's a robot, what is a robot, fuck everyone, I'm

07:32.960 --> 07:39.160
never calling 911, I'm going to do something wrong.

07:39.160 --> 07:42.760
Dan, who have you killed?

07:42.760 --> 07:49.960
I'm never going to kill anybody, but yes, you are and you're, it's only a matter of

07:49.960 --> 07:55.880
time before we're all adjacent to a murder, God forbid, I just don't think it's fair that

07:55.880 --> 08:01.040
people like analyze how you respond to a trauma, right, I also like, here's the thing, we're

08:01.040 --> 08:06.000
going to have our, look, if you're a big fan of our podcast and you just want, I'm not

08:06.000 --> 08:10.560
like an Oprah or like picture pages thing where I'm like, you have to listen to this,

08:10.560 --> 08:20.040
but you should know in March, the red-handed podcast ladies are coming out from Jolly England,

08:20.040 --> 08:24.800
they're going to come out and be our guests and so like you have that heads up like maybe,

08:24.800 --> 08:26.560
what are we talking about?

08:26.560 --> 08:32.800
Get addicted to that podcast, wonderful best true crime podcast I've heard ever recently

08:32.800 --> 08:41.440
and the red ladies from England, God damn it, forget, let's just move on, what is happening?

08:41.440 --> 08:44.480
How long have I been gone?

08:44.480 --> 08:54.600
Your beard is gray and long, Jeff, you seem so much further away than usual.

08:54.600 --> 09:07.040
One thing that I like about their podcast, the red-handed podcast, which is a true crime

09:07.040 --> 09:08.040
podcast.

09:08.040 --> 09:09.040
The red-handed...

09:09.040 --> 09:14.000
It's called red-handed, figure it out, like you're an adult, okay, I'm thinking Mittens,

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
I'm sorry, red-handed.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
You're thinking Mittens?

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
Yeah.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
Why?

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
Why are you thinking Mittens?

09:19.000 --> 09:24.240
I have a pair of red Mittens, that's why I'm thinking of it.

09:24.240 --> 09:36.440
Listen to yourself, you sound like you, sir, you need to calm down.

09:36.440 --> 09:44.680
I've come home, my father drank weird lemonade, he's, all right, anyways, the thing I like

09:44.680 --> 09:48.400
about, one of the many things I like about their podcast is that every single time a

09:48.400 --> 09:54.040
lie detector comes up, it's time to like open, like we have to revolt against this

09:54.040 --> 09:57.360
kind, lie detectors are bullshit, it's bullshit.

09:57.360 --> 09:58.360
Who did you kill?

09:58.360 --> 10:02.040
You killed somebody, there's a body that you're...

10:02.040 --> 10:06.800
Never killed anybody, never gonna kill anybody, and at some point in my life before I die,

10:06.800 --> 10:14.640
I will be somehow misconstrued and judged because of my affect, and whether it's like

10:14.640 --> 10:22.440
I fail a polygraph test or I refuse to take one, which is like, oh, that's weird, he refused

10:22.440 --> 10:28.280
to take a polygraph test, everyone please refuse to take every polygraph test, they

10:28.280 --> 10:29.280
mean nothing.

10:29.280 --> 10:33.280
It's the amateurs that screw it up for the rest of us.

10:33.280 --> 10:37.880
The amateur polygraph administrators?

10:37.880 --> 10:40.040
Or do you mean...

10:40.040 --> 10:41.040
Or amateur liars.

10:41.040 --> 10:42.040
Yeah, yeah.

10:42.040 --> 10:46.240
All right, look, take your pick, I can see it's gonna be one of those shows.

10:46.240 --> 10:53.280
Dan, look, I know like a few of like the main like five tells when you're telling...

10:53.280 --> 10:54.280
About lying.

10:54.280 --> 10:55.280
Yeah.

10:55.280 --> 10:56.280
Okay, so I'm gonna ask you...

10:56.280 --> 10:57.280
So you're like a human polygraph.

10:57.280 --> 10:59.960
I'm gonna ask you a question that we both know the answer to, but I want you to tell

10:59.960 --> 11:02.920
me the wrong answer.

11:02.920 --> 11:06.360
Okay.

11:06.360 --> 11:07.760
What's your middle name?

11:07.760 --> 11:08.760
James.

11:08.760 --> 11:09.760
Yeah.

11:09.760 --> 11:13.760
You already did, you did two of the tells, all right.

11:13.760 --> 11:17.240
You already...

11:17.240 --> 11:19.040
Two of the what kind of tells?

11:19.040 --> 11:20.040
Lies.

11:20.040 --> 11:21.040
That's my name.

11:21.040 --> 11:22.040
You asked me what my middle name is.

11:22.040 --> 11:24.440
No, no, I told you to do it wrong.

11:24.440 --> 11:26.040
I told you to lie.

11:26.040 --> 11:27.920
Well, I didn't lie, I was testing you.

11:27.920 --> 11:29.280
I told you to lie.

11:29.280 --> 11:34.440
And I told the truth and revealed that you don't know the difference.

11:34.440 --> 11:36.440
You're supposed to give the wrong answer.

11:36.440 --> 11:38.640
And when you think I'm lying, and you confidently told me...

11:38.640 --> 11:39.960
You perceive it as a lie.

11:39.960 --> 11:40.960
Okay, so now...

11:40.960 --> 11:42.960
That's the biggest fucking I'm nailed.

11:42.960 --> 11:43.960
Now lie...

11:43.960 --> 11:44.960
Now lie to me.

11:44.960 --> 11:45.960
I will.

11:45.960 --> 11:46.960
I promise to lie to you.

11:46.960 --> 11:47.960
Okay.

11:47.960 --> 11:52.960
What's...

11:52.960 --> 11:55.680
What day is today?

11:55.680 --> 11:56.680
Three.

11:56.680 --> 11:59.240
I swear to God.

11:59.240 --> 12:01.440
I fucking swear to God.

12:01.440 --> 12:05.000
Strike me with lightning, if it's not three today.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.160
What is your mother's maiden name?

12:07.160 --> 12:08.160
Yellow.

12:08.160 --> 12:09.960
You see, you're going to jail.

12:09.960 --> 12:10.960
With an E.

12:10.960 --> 12:11.960
You killed somebody.

12:11.960 --> 12:12.960
No.

12:12.960 --> 12:13.960
You killed somebody.

12:13.960 --> 12:14.960
I killed nobody.

12:14.960 --> 12:15.960
I didn't kill anybody.

12:15.960 --> 12:16.960
You're...

12:16.960 --> 12:17.960
Spencer isn't here tonight.

12:17.960 --> 12:21.960
Did you kill Spencer?

12:21.960 --> 12:22.960
Polygraph tests are garbage.

12:22.960 --> 12:23.960
You killed Spencer.

12:23.960 --> 12:27.760
You're trying to get out in front of this 9-11 call in your lie detector test because

12:27.760 --> 12:31.400
you murdered Spencer.

12:31.400 --> 12:37.440
And while you hesitate, you have the right to remain silent.

12:37.440 --> 12:41.400
Look, my first guest.

12:41.400 --> 12:46.280
People's know her as Aida Blankenship from Mad Men.

12:46.280 --> 12:47.280
Right.

12:47.280 --> 12:49.520
Jen Excer's know her as Mama LaRusso.

12:49.520 --> 12:50.640
I know her as my...

12:50.640 --> 12:51.640
From the Karate Kid.

12:51.640 --> 12:52.640
Right.

12:52.640 --> 12:53.640
Yeah.

12:53.640 --> 12:54.640
I know her as my future mother-in-law.

12:54.640 --> 13:05.520
Can you please welcome Randy Heller to the stage?

13:05.520 --> 13:06.520
Randy Heller?

13:06.520 --> 13:22.040
Have a seat.

13:22.040 --> 13:25.080
How many days did you work on Karate Kid?

13:25.080 --> 13:28.840
How many days of a shoot was that for you as Mama LaRusso?

13:28.840 --> 13:30.840
You don't have your call sheet?

13:30.840 --> 13:35.000
I guess I worked about three, four weeks or something.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
Is this working?

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
Yeah.

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
You got to eat that mic, though.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
Wow.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
Yeah.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
Well, I guess let's get this out of the way.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
Yeah.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
I want to cement this.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
I've mentioned it before.

13:46.000 --> 13:49.320
It's been a theory, but I want to make it a technical fact.

13:49.320 --> 13:56.320
As of your daughter proposing to me, I am now officially and technically a Karate Kid in

13:56.320 --> 13:57.320
law.

13:57.320 --> 13:58.320
That's right.

13:58.320 --> 14:01.720
In every way that matters.

14:01.720 --> 14:02.720
My son.

14:02.720 --> 14:03.720
Yeah.

14:03.720 --> 14:04.720
To be.

14:04.720 --> 14:05.720
Yeah.

14:05.720 --> 14:06.720
You've got it, right?

14:06.720 --> 14:07.720
I'm very.

14:07.720 --> 14:09.760
Because you know that I love you.

14:09.760 --> 14:10.760
You know that.

14:10.760 --> 14:11.760
We've determined that.

14:11.760 --> 14:12.760
Not at first.

14:12.760 --> 14:13.760
No.

14:13.760 --> 14:14.760
Not so much.

14:14.760 --> 14:15.760
It wasn't.

14:15.760 --> 14:17.040
It wasn't love at first sight.

14:17.040 --> 14:18.600
But he's grown on me.

14:18.600 --> 14:19.840
Like a fungus.

14:19.840 --> 14:26.480
A lot of me joining your family is learning what love really is.

14:26.480 --> 14:32.160
I mean, my relationship with Cody, I'm like, oh, that's what love, oh, shit.

14:32.160 --> 14:35.320
There's no knocking on any previous relationship I've ever had.

14:35.320 --> 14:38.480
I just sort of like, and then I join your family.

14:38.480 --> 14:40.120
You guys really love each other.

14:40.120 --> 14:47.160
It's really, it can be alienating and dizzying to an astronaut from the vacuum of.

14:47.160 --> 14:48.320
I can understand that.

14:48.320 --> 14:49.320
Yeah.

14:49.320 --> 14:50.320
Yeah.

14:50.320 --> 14:51.320
I have a lot of us.

14:51.320 --> 14:52.320
But don't count yourself in you just yet.

14:52.320 --> 14:53.320
No, no, no.

14:53.320 --> 14:54.320
I won't.

14:54.320 --> 14:55.760
I just want to, you know, step by step.

14:55.760 --> 14:56.760
Yeah.

14:56.760 --> 14:57.760
That makes me comfortable.

14:57.760 --> 15:01.120
I like knowing that there's like airlocks and like conditions.

15:01.120 --> 15:03.000
That makes me comfortable.

15:03.000 --> 15:09.200
Like for instance, like I remember distinctly, very shortly into me dating Cody, which was

15:09.200 --> 15:12.160
a pretty intense rebound.

15:12.160 --> 15:17.600
I can say that now that it's like permanent, but I mean, there was no indications.

15:17.600 --> 15:25.480
I was like, I was dating Cody very quickly after the divorce of my last relationship,

15:25.480 --> 15:27.080
which made both of us ponder things.

15:27.080 --> 15:29.280
Anyway, put a pin in my view on this.

15:29.280 --> 15:32.480
This is about you.

15:32.480 --> 15:35.800
You had this apartment in New York or you were staying at Cody's apartment in New York.

15:35.800 --> 15:36.800
Yes.

15:36.800 --> 15:42.240
And I went to visit her on her first show because she did this show called Dead Beat for three

15:42.240 --> 15:43.240
seasons.

15:43.240 --> 15:44.240
Right.

15:44.240 --> 15:45.240
And I went to visit her.

15:45.240 --> 15:46.240
Okay.

15:46.240 --> 15:47.240
Good.

15:47.240 --> 15:48.240
Good.

15:48.240 --> 15:49.240
It's Cody.

15:49.240 --> 15:50.240
Cody.

15:50.240 --> 15:51.240
Come out here.

15:51.240 --> 15:52.240
Not now, Cody.

15:52.240 --> 15:53.240
Come out, Cody.

15:53.240 --> 15:54.240
No, she doesn't have to.

15:54.240 --> 15:55.240
Come on.

15:55.240 --> 15:56.240
Yeah.

15:56.240 --> 15:57.240
Yeah.

15:57.240 --> 15:58.240
Yeah.

15:58.240 --> 15:59.240
Yeah.

15:59.240 --> 16:00.240
Yeah.

16:00.240 --> 16:07.480
I'm totally in love with this child because grab a seat and grab a mic.

16:07.480 --> 16:11.240
So she got this show and she's on this show.

16:11.240 --> 16:12.240
Eat that mic.

16:12.240 --> 16:13.240
Huh?

16:13.240 --> 16:14.240
Eat the mic.

16:14.240 --> 16:15.240
Eat it.

16:15.240 --> 16:16.240
Eat it.

16:16.240 --> 16:17.240
Okay.

16:17.240 --> 16:20.680
So she gets the show and I'm like thrilled.

16:20.680 --> 16:22.880
My kid has her own show.

16:22.880 --> 16:27.360
And so I went to New York to visit her and it's cold in New York.

16:27.360 --> 16:33.840
So I bought a lot of stuff to warm myself because it's freezing, a hat, gloves, coat.

16:33.840 --> 16:34.840
Okay.

16:34.840 --> 16:36.320
But first, hold on.

16:36.320 --> 16:37.320
Okay.

16:37.320 --> 16:38.320
All right.

16:38.320 --> 16:40.120
See what it's like to be...

16:40.120 --> 16:41.760
But you brought her out.

16:41.760 --> 16:42.760
I know.

16:42.760 --> 16:43.760
You brought me out.

16:43.760 --> 16:47.280
So if this gets frustrating, yeah.

16:47.280 --> 16:48.520
So should I continue the story?

16:48.520 --> 16:49.520
Yeah.

16:49.520 --> 16:50.520
All right.

16:50.520 --> 16:53.280
So I bought this huge scarf to keep me warm.

16:53.280 --> 16:54.280
Oh, geez.

16:54.280 --> 16:55.280
Okay.

16:55.280 --> 16:56.280
Here it is.

16:56.280 --> 16:57.280
I brought you up for the scarf story.

16:57.280 --> 16:58.280
Yeah.

16:58.280 --> 16:59.280
It's a scarf story.

16:59.280 --> 17:00.280
All right.

17:00.280 --> 17:06.760
So I bought this enormous long white and black scarf to keep my neck warm.

17:06.760 --> 17:08.600
And it was not that cute.

17:08.600 --> 17:13.560
Like you tried it on and we looked at it and we both agreed it wasn't that cute.

17:13.560 --> 17:15.560
Or I at least...

17:15.560 --> 17:16.560
Okay.

17:16.560 --> 17:17.560
I at least thought that.

17:17.560 --> 17:18.560
Really?

17:18.560 --> 17:19.560
There was contention about the scarf.

17:19.560 --> 17:20.560
Oh.

17:20.560 --> 17:21.560
So there was initial contention?

17:21.560 --> 17:22.560
I...

17:22.560 --> 17:23.560
Okay.

17:23.560 --> 17:24.560
You tell your version of it.

17:24.560 --> 17:25.560
You shouldn't have brought me out here.

17:25.560 --> 17:26.560
Yes.

17:26.560 --> 17:27.560
I'm not going to talk anymore.

17:27.560 --> 17:28.560
Just tell the scarf story.

17:28.560 --> 17:29.560
All right.

17:29.560 --> 17:33.920
So I got all dressed up and I'm supposed to meet her for lunch or breakfast, whatever

17:33.920 --> 17:34.920
it was.

17:34.920 --> 17:39.280
So I put everything on knowing that I'm going to go out and like really freezing temperature.

17:39.280 --> 17:40.280
Big long scarf.

17:40.280 --> 17:41.280
Now when?

17:41.280 --> 17:43.880
Big long fucking scarf.

17:43.880 --> 17:45.160
So I...

17:45.160 --> 17:50.440
You know when you go on vacation, you're kind of off your routine, like going to the bathroom

17:50.440 --> 17:53.040
in the morning, you know, like at home, eight o'clock.

17:53.040 --> 17:55.160
You're talking about constipation irregularity.

17:55.160 --> 17:56.160
Yeah.

17:56.160 --> 17:57.160
Right.

17:57.160 --> 18:02.000
It's like vacation altered poop, you know.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.880
So a VAP, we call it in my family.

18:03.880 --> 18:08.360
We have a thing called VAPs, which was supposed to be an acronym, but it actually isn't because

18:08.360 --> 18:10.360
vacation induced...

18:10.360 --> 18:11.360
No.

18:11.360 --> 18:12.360
What is it?

18:12.360 --> 18:13.360
I think it's altered poop.

18:13.360 --> 18:14.360
No, that's not it.

18:14.360 --> 18:18.120
So in other words, instead of going to the bathroom at eight o'clock, when you're on vacation,

18:18.120 --> 18:19.120
you're off.

18:19.120 --> 18:20.360
You're off your routine.

18:20.360 --> 18:23.720
So I got all dressed up and I didn't go to the bathroom.

18:23.720 --> 18:24.720
Nobody.

18:24.720 --> 18:25.720
Nobody.

18:25.720 --> 18:29.560
When you're regular, you don't go, it's eight o'clock, this is when I poop, like that's

18:29.560 --> 18:30.560
not...

18:30.560 --> 18:35.360
No, like every morning at about eight o'clock, I have to take a dump.

18:35.360 --> 18:36.360
Okay.

18:36.360 --> 18:37.360
All right.

18:37.360 --> 18:38.360
All right.

18:38.360 --> 18:39.360
What's wrong with that?

18:39.360 --> 18:40.360
No, that's why I've always felt...

18:40.360 --> 18:43.320
That's why I always feel like I'm constipated, because you've made it seem to be like it

18:43.320 --> 18:46.440
was going to be this thing that happened every day to give in time, and it's not for me at

18:46.440 --> 18:47.440
all.

18:47.440 --> 18:48.440
Okay.

18:48.440 --> 18:51.240
I'm just saying, like I think that's part of why I always get constipated, it's like

18:51.240 --> 18:54.920
I put this pressure on myself, I'm like, oh, it's not...

18:54.920 --> 18:58.680
It's a parenting fail, like you should have done better or something happened there, you

18:58.680 --> 18:59.680
know what I'm saying?

18:59.680 --> 19:00.680
I feel so bad now.

19:00.680 --> 19:01.880
I feel so guilty.

19:01.880 --> 19:05.840
Something happened with my butthole that I have stuff going on with that, you know?

19:05.840 --> 19:09.000
I got my first hemorrhoid, I told you, I sent you a picture.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
I sent you a picture.

19:10.000 --> 19:15.840
Remember, I sent you a picture of a first hemorrhoid to her and then my sister, because

19:15.840 --> 19:17.880
well, I wanted to know for sure what it was.

19:17.880 --> 19:19.920
You sent your mother a picture of your hemorrhoid?

19:19.920 --> 19:21.920
Yeah, and then Dan saw it too.

19:21.920 --> 19:25.240
Yeah, on accident, slowly.

19:25.240 --> 19:26.240
You liked it.

19:26.240 --> 19:27.240
All right.

19:27.240 --> 19:28.240
So, like...

19:28.240 --> 19:29.240
You still liked it, though.

19:29.240 --> 19:30.240
I'm not going to get the story out.

19:30.240 --> 19:33.240
I'm fine with the seat room, but I want to keep the train on rails.

19:33.240 --> 19:38.640
To be fair, guys, we warned you, this is going to be an emotionally intense episode.

19:38.640 --> 19:39.640
Hold on.

19:39.640 --> 19:40.640
So, you...

19:40.640 --> 19:41.640
Right?

19:41.640 --> 19:42.640
Goose?

19:42.640 --> 19:43.640
Yeah.

19:43.640 --> 19:44.640
Uh-oh.

19:44.640 --> 19:45.640
All right.

19:45.640 --> 19:46.640
Well...

19:46.640 --> 19:47.640
Mom, finish the story.

19:47.640 --> 19:48.640
I need help.

19:48.640 --> 19:49.640
I need some help.

19:49.640 --> 19:50.640
Can we back up?

19:50.640 --> 19:51.640
Can we...

19:51.640 --> 19:52.640
Yeah.

19:52.640 --> 19:53.640
Yeah.

19:53.640 --> 19:56.240
I think you guys should go out and come back on again.

19:56.240 --> 20:00.520
The way that she's told, whatever she just told about that, we can not talk about that

20:00.520 --> 20:01.520
for a second.

20:01.520 --> 20:04.040
Go back to what you were talking about was like the first time that you guys met.

20:04.040 --> 20:05.040
No, that doesn't matter.

20:05.040 --> 20:06.040
We've accelerated.

20:06.040 --> 20:07.360
Like, she's halfway through the scarf story.

20:07.360 --> 20:08.360
I want...

20:08.360 --> 20:09.360
I'm fine.

20:09.360 --> 20:10.360
We're going back.

20:10.360 --> 20:11.360
We're going back.

20:11.360 --> 20:12.360
Hold on to the poop story.

20:12.360 --> 20:13.360
Hold on.

20:13.360 --> 20:14.360
Hold on.

20:14.360 --> 20:15.360
Go ahead.

20:15.360 --> 20:16.360
No.

20:16.360 --> 20:17.360
Go ahead.

20:17.360 --> 20:18.360
All right.

20:18.360 --> 20:19.360
Okay, okay.

20:19.360 --> 20:20.360
I fucked it up.

20:20.360 --> 20:21.360
I fucked it up.

20:21.360 --> 20:23.720
It's a family fight right here on the stage.

20:23.720 --> 20:25.200
I'm going to love this.

20:25.200 --> 20:26.200
Okay, okay, okay.

20:26.200 --> 20:27.200
God damn it.

20:27.200 --> 20:28.200
The fucking scarf story was like...

20:28.200 --> 20:29.200
Mom, scarf story.

20:29.200 --> 20:30.200
How are you going to continue?

20:30.200 --> 20:31.200
I met with the goddess and now it's off the rails.

20:31.200 --> 20:32.520
Take a look at the scarf story.

20:32.520 --> 20:33.520
It's such a good story.

20:33.520 --> 20:34.520
Okay.

20:34.520 --> 20:35.520
You guys...

20:35.520 --> 20:36.520
Build it up.

20:36.520 --> 20:37.520
Okay, okay.

20:37.520 --> 20:38.520
I'm going to catch everybody.

20:38.520 --> 20:39.520
All right.

20:39.520 --> 20:40.520
Catch them up.

20:40.520 --> 20:41.520
All right.

20:41.520 --> 20:45.240
Previously on the scarf story, mom is visiting New York.

20:45.240 --> 20:46.880
She bought an outfit.

20:46.880 --> 20:50.880
She got this long scarf, daughter not into it.

20:50.880 --> 20:51.880
I think...

20:51.880 --> 20:52.880
That's all right.

20:52.880 --> 20:57.320
Get in dress to go meet the daughter and then...

20:57.320 --> 20:58.320
So...

20:58.320 --> 20:59.320
An unscheduled visitor.

20:59.320 --> 21:00.320
Unscheduled poop.

21:00.320 --> 21:01.320
Yeah.

21:01.320 --> 21:05.560
Like, you know, your stomach starts to like turn and I'm going, oh fuck.

21:05.560 --> 21:07.960
It's eight and 12 o'clock New York time.

21:07.960 --> 21:09.720
I'm way off my schedule.

21:09.720 --> 21:11.360
I got to go to the bathroom.

21:11.360 --> 21:14.400
So it's like time to go meet you.

21:14.400 --> 21:17.720
And I said, well, I'm not going to take all my clothes off, my scarf, my hat, my gloves.

21:17.720 --> 21:19.520
I'm just going to go to the bathroom.

21:19.520 --> 21:31.280
So I went and it was a mess because I got up and the scarf went into the toilet.

21:31.280 --> 21:35.400
My $150 scarf into the...

21:35.400 --> 21:36.400
Into the potpourri.

21:36.400 --> 21:39.000
And you had shit on top of it.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
Yeah.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
No.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
Now the shit is all over the scarf.

21:42.000 --> 21:45.680
The scarf had gone into the toilet and you shit on top of it.

21:45.680 --> 21:46.680
Yeah.

21:46.680 --> 21:47.680
Okay.

21:47.680 --> 21:48.680
I walk in.

21:48.680 --> 21:49.680
You shit on the scarf.

21:49.680 --> 21:50.680
It was already shit in there.

21:50.680 --> 21:51.680
Yeah.

21:51.680 --> 21:53.000
What do you mean there was shit already in there?

21:53.000 --> 21:54.240
I shit and when I got the scarf...

21:54.240 --> 21:55.540
How would there be shit already in there?

21:55.540 --> 21:56.540
Wait a minute.

21:56.540 --> 21:57.540
No.

21:57.540 --> 21:59.880
Because I got up in the scarf because it was so long went into the toilet.

21:59.880 --> 22:00.880
Aww.

22:00.880 --> 22:01.880
What do you mean?

22:01.880 --> 22:02.880
I thought you sat...

22:02.880 --> 22:06.480
I thought before you sat the scarf went into the toilet and then you took a big dump on

22:06.480 --> 22:07.480
the scarf.

22:07.480 --> 22:08.480
Right.

22:08.480 --> 22:09.480
Right.

22:09.480 --> 22:10.480
You're saying the same thing.

22:10.480 --> 22:11.480
You're saying the same thing now.

22:11.480 --> 22:12.480
We're saying the same thing.

22:12.480 --> 22:13.480
Yeah.

22:13.480 --> 22:14.480
Okay.

22:14.480 --> 22:15.480
All right.

22:15.480 --> 22:16.480
God, I thought...

22:16.480 --> 22:17.480
Okay.

22:17.480 --> 22:18.480
Oh my God.

22:18.480 --> 22:19.480
You shit on the scarf.

22:19.480 --> 22:23.040
You shit on the scarf and just it had fringes.

22:23.040 --> 22:26.360
So all the fringes were...

22:26.360 --> 22:27.360
So I got...

22:27.360 --> 22:28.360
And I...

22:28.360 --> 22:29.360
So I got up and I went...

22:29.360 --> 22:31.880
But I feel like I walked in during some of this now.

22:31.880 --> 22:32.880
No, you were gone.

22:32.880 --> 22:33.880
You were gone.

22:33.880 --> 22:34.880
Okay.

22:34.880 --> 22:35.880
Well, if this...

22:35.880 --> 22:38.480
If I had seen this, I would have flipped the fuck out because I remember...

22:38.480 --> 22:39.480
Wait.

22:39.480 --> 22:42.480
In the apartment, remember how I was just like always mad at you for making messes?

22:42.480 --> 22:43.480
Right.

22:43.480 --> 22:44.680
I would have flipped out if I knew that she...

22:44.680 --> 22:45.680
She would have...

22:45.680 --> 22:46.680
So you were trying to hide it from me.

22:46.680 --> 22:51.600
Because what happened is so I took the scarf out and I started washing it, really scrubbing

22:51.600 --> 22:53.400
it down thinking, I could do this.

22:53.400 --> 22:55.120
I could make this happen.

22:55.120 --> 23:04.920
So I scrubbed it down and then I took it and I laid it out on Cody's heater to dry it.

23:04.920 --> 23:07.400
She was not happy.

23:07.400 --> 23:08.400
Nothing smelled.

23:08.400 --> 23:09.400
She washed it properly.

23:09.400 --> 23:10.400
It was just the idea.

23:10.400 --> 23:11.400
It was gone.

23:11.400 --> 23:12.400
It was gone.

23:12.400 --> 23:14.800
It was like a brand new scarf.

23:14.800 --> 23:17.600
So I went to have lunch.

23:17.600 --> 23:18.600
We...

23:18.600 --> 23:21.160
He likes the story.

23:21.160 --> 23:22.160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

23:22.160 --> 23:30.040
So we came back and I said, Cody, the scarf that's on the dryer was full of shit.

23:30.040 --> 23:31.680
But it's clean now.

23:31.680 --> 23:32.680
She flipped out.

23:32.680 --> 23:35.160
She goes, what do you mean you put it on my dryer?

23:35.160 --> 23:36.160
The shit scarf.

23:36.160 --> 23:37.160
Right?

23:37.160 --> 23:39.160
Because I have a little bit of a seedy.

23:39.160 --> 23:40.160
She has a little seedy germaphobic...

23:40.160 --> 23:41.160
I will see the germaphobic...

23:41.160 --> 23:42.160
I'm a lot...

23:42.160 --> 23:43.160
All right.

23:43.160 --> 23:44.160
I'm a lot better.

23:44.160 --> 23:45.160
Yeah.

23:45.160 --> 23:47.320
So the best part is...

23:47.320 --> 23:49.840
And I said, okay, now I got to go home to New York.

23:49.840 --> 23:51.360
So I went back to New York.

23:51.360 --> 23:52.360
To LA.

23:52.360 --> 23:53.360
To LA.

23:53.360 --> 23:54.360
Oh, I mean, sorry.

23:54.360 --> 23:55.360
LA.

23:55.360 --> 23:57.040
And the shit's gone to my friend.

23:57.040 --> 24:01.680
So I went home and I kept the tissue paper and the bag from this store.

24:01.680 --> 24:05.920
So I wrapped it up and I said, I'm going to fucking return this thing because I'm not

24:05.920 --> 24:08.920
going to wear a scarf that has poop on it.

24:08.920 --> 24:09.920
No.

24:09.920 --> 24:10.920
No.

24:10.920 --> 24:13.160
There's no way that I am going to put a poop...

24:13.160 --> 24:17.400
I know that the poop is residue, you know?

24:17.400 --> 24:23.920
So I went to the store and I went up to the lady and I said, I'd like to return this scarf.

24:23.920 --> 24:25.720
You are a bad person.

24:25.720 --> 24:27.200
Wait, wait, wait.

24:27.200 --> 24:28.200
Put a pin in that.

24:28.200 --> 24:29.200
Okay.

24:29.200 --> 24:30.200
We're almost there.

24:30.200 --> 24:31.200
All right.

24:31.200 --> 24:35.320
And she said to me, is there anything wrong with it?

24:35.320 --> 24:36.320
And you said...

24:36.320 --> 24:38.760
I said, no, no, no, no, it's fine.

24:38.760 --> 24:41.920
It's just that I bought it for my daughter.

24:41.920 --> 24:46.040
And it's like 12 feet long and she's very short.

24:46.040 --> 24:51.360
And every time she wears it, she steps on it and trips, so I'd like to return it.

24:51.360 --> 24:52.360
That was the...

24:52.360 --> 24:54.360
That wasn't a very good stuff.

24:54.360 --> 24:55.360
God damn it.

24:55.360 --> 24:56.360
That's not the punchline.

24:56.360 --> 24:57.360
That's how you said it.

24:57.360 --> 24:58.360
That's how you said the first time.

24:58.360 --> 24:59.360
Let me finish the story.

24:59.360 --> 25:00.360
All right.

25:00.360 --> 25:02.160
I'd like to return this scarf.

25:02.160 --> 25:03.160
She said...

25:03.160 --> 25:04.160
Ask me why.

25:04.160 --> 25:05.160
What's wrong with it?

25:05.160 --> 25:07.640
Well, it's too long and my daughter didn't like it.

25:07.640 --> 25:08.640
Yeah.

25:08.640 --> 25:09.640
That's how you said it to us.

25:09.640 --> 25:10.640
Which is true.

25:10.640 --> 25:14.720
Because it's so long that it went in the toilet and it took a shit on it and your daughter

25:14.720 --> 25:18.360
didn't like it because it was coated in shit.

25:18.360 --> 25:22.200
But you just leave certain details out and then you return it, all right.

25:22.200 --> 25:25.480
Is somebody in New York walking around wearing a poops scarf?

25:25.480 --> 25:26.480
Probably.

25:26.480 --> 25:27.480
No, I don't think...

25:27.480 --> 25:28.480
No, no, in LA.

25:28.480 --> 25:31.040
The reason that I didn't get that upset about it is because I was like, no one's ever gonna

25:31.040 --> 25:32.540
buy this.

25:32.540 --> 25:37.800
That's the kind of store where it has the clearance section and it will just disappear into oblivion.

25:37.800 --> 25:40.320
And so that's why I didn't admonish you.

25:40.320 --> 25:41.320
I was like...

25:41.320 --> 25:45.600
Ultimately, when I found out, I was like, all right, it's a flawed thing a character would

25:45.600 --> 25:46.600
do but...

25:46.600 --> 25:54.480
I have to say, Randy, that if you poop on a scarf, don't try to get the money back.

25:54.480 --> 25:56.480
Well, I did it.

25:56.480 --> 25:58.840
I was gonna exchange it for credit.

25:58.840 --> 26:05.000
Fuck, I saved that one.

26:05.000 --> 26:12.320
I wanna segue into another guest that's like...I've been doing like a public television thing

26:12.320 --> 26:16.680
where we're like linking things and that's why it's emotionally complicated because you're

26:16.680 --> 26:18.320
my future mom-in-law.

26:18.320 --> 26:20.800
You pooped on a scarf.

26:20.800 --> 26:22.240
You were Mama LaRusso.

26:22.240 --> 26:23.240
You were...

26:23.240 --> 26:26.280
She was Rizzo in Greece on Broadway.

26:26.280 --> 26:27.280
You were Rizzo...

26:27.280 --> 26:28.280
She was on Broadway.

26:28.280 --> 26:29.280
You were the original Rizzo, right?

26:29.280 --> 26:30.280
Were you...

26:30.280 --> 26:31.280
No, there was one original Rizzo.

26:31.280 --> 26:32.280
But then...

26:32.280 --> 26:34.280
Were you the original Rizzo or not?

26:34.280 --> 26:35.280
You were.

26:35.280 --> 26:36.280
You still love me?

26:36.280 --> 26:37.280
Wait.

26:37.280 --> 26:38.280
Well, no.

26:38.280 --> 26:39.280
But I mean...

26:39.280 --> 26:40.280
But after...

26:40.280 --> 26:41.280
Who played the original Rizzo?

26:41.280 --> 26:42.280
Adrian Barbo.

26:42.280 --> 26:43.280
No.

26:43.280 --> 26:44.280
Yeah.

26:44.280 --> 26:45.280
Wait.

26:45.280 --> 26:46.280
On Broadway, Adrian Barbo.

26:46.280 --> 26:47.280
Oh, okay.

26:47.280 --> 26:48.280
Really?

26:48.280 --> 26:49.280
Adrian Barbo?

26:49.280 --> 26:50.280
Yeah, Adrian Barbo.

26:50.280 --> 26:51.280
From Swamp Thing?

26:51.280 --> 26:52.280
Huh?

26:52.280 --> 26:54.120
I know her as Adrian Barbo from Swamp Thing.

26:54.120 --> 26:55.120
She was an 80s...

26:55.120 --> 26:56.120
Oh, right.

26:56.120 --> 26:57.120
Yes.

26:57.120 --> 26:58.120
Yes.

26:58.120 --> 26:59.120
Like she was...

26:59.120 --> 27:00.120
She has big breasts.

27:00.120 --> 27:01.120
Kind of like 80s B movie kind of thing.

27:01.120 --> 27:02.120
She was the original.

27:02.120 --> 27:03.120
Okay.

27:03.120 --> 27:05.600
She was a huge run of Rizzo on Broadway.

27:05.600 --> 27:06.600
You were basically...

27:06.600 --> 27:07.600
Two years.

27:07.600 --> 27:08.600
Yeah.

27:08.600 --> 27:10.960
And so our next guest was...

27:10.960 --> 27:11.960
Johnny Angel.

27:11.960 --> 27:12.960
Johnny Angel.

27:12.960 --> 27:13.960
Does anybody...

27:13.960 --> 27:14.960
Do you guys know Grease?

27:14.960 --> 27:15.960
Teen Angel.

27:15.960 --> 27:16.960
Why is there Johnny Angel?

27:16.960 --> 27:17.960
Teen Angel.

27:17.960 --> 27:18.960
Beauty School Dropout, the song.

27:18.960 --> 27:21.520
Like the guy that comes in these things, the Beauty School Dropout.

27:21.520 --> 27:22.520
Right.

27:22.520 --> 27:23.520
Beauty School Dropout.

27:23.520 --> 27:27.580
Anyway, so I'll explain beyond that connection why we're bringing him up.

27:27.580 --> 27:29.080
Please welcome Bob Garrett.

27:29.080 --> 27:30.080
Bob Garrett?

27:30.080 --> 27:37.080
Bob Garrett.

27:37.080 --> 27:38.080
Thank you.

27:38.080 --> 27:39.080
Thank you for coming.

27:39.080 --> 27:48.080
I'm very nervous because Randy gave me the scarf from my birthday.

27:48.080 --> 27:55.360
Mom, you got to talk into the mic.

27:55.360 --> 27:56.360
Yeah.

27:56.360 --> 28:03.360
Okay, we know each other from college and then we did Godspell together and then Grease

28:03.360 --> 28:05.760
together on Broadway.

28:05.760 --> 28:10.120
So we go back a long, long, 50 years, but he tells everybody I'm his nanny.

28:10.120 --> 28:11.120
You're correct.

28:11.120 --> 28:12.120
So, yeah.

28:12.120 --> 28:13.120
And a good one you were.

28:13.120 --> 28:14.120
Oh, I was.

28:14.120 --> 28:15.120
The best.

28:15.120 --> 28:18.240
But Bob, there was a linkage here.

28:18.240 --> 28:20.880
I mean, look, I'm not a good podcast host.

28:20.880 --> 28:23.720
I'm not a good podcast producer.

28:23.720 --> 28:25.520
But things happen.

28:25.520 --> 28:33.320
We follow our guts and our feelings and stuff, and we recently lost a friend that we've talked

28:33.320 --> 28:37.480
about many times on this podcast, like kind of in the periphery, like we've probably mentioned

28:37.480 --> 28:43.720
his name a dozen or two dozen times in 300 and some episodes because he was so instrumental

28:43.720 --> 28:44.720
to our lives.

28:44.720 --> 28:52.560
This guy, Sam Christensen, and he just recently passed a few weeks ago, and it was like very

28:52.560 --> 28:59.080
unexpected, and I know that weirdly, Randy had a connection to him.

28:59.080 --> 29:04.480
I mean, I know Sam knew you and Cody, but that was just like weird coincidence.

29:04.480 --> 29:09.280
And I said, Randy, will you come on the show and like now seems like a good time because

29:09.280 --> 29:13.760
maybe you could tell some Sam stories and you're like, I don't know Sam well enough

29:13.760 --> 29:20.160
to like eulogize him, but Bob, who you've met, like was really close to him.

29:20.160 --> 29:25.680
You saw him right before his passing, and so I thought, Kismet, we need to eulogize

29:25.680 --> 29:31.640
Sam Christensen, someone that like he's not a household name, but if you've listened to

29:31.640 --> 29:38.160
this podcast for hundreds of episodes, then Sam has like been caressing and touching you

29:38.160 --> 29:47.480
the entire time because Jeff and I's origin stories go back and intertwine with Sam.

29:47.480 --> 29:55.000
So for those of us, let's kind of like now just like remember him and start with how

29:55.000 --> 29:57.720
did you meet Sam, Bob?

29:57.720 --> 30:04.240
Well, we were doing Godspell, and Sam was the liaison between the actors and the producers.

30:04.240 --> 30:08.160
He worked for the producers, and he was so great.

30:08.160 --> 30:11.720
And every time he'd come to the theater, he'd say, by the way, tonight Paul Newman and

30:11.720 --> 30:15.760
Joanne Woodward are here, and they're not coming backstage because Paul doesn't come

30:15.760 --> 30:21.800
backstage, and then Paul Newman would walk into the theater in an all-white suit in February.

30:21.800 --> 30:22.800
But he...

30:22.800 --> 30:24.280
Do you know who Paul Newman is?

30:24.280 --> 30:26.600
I mean, they've heard of him.

30:26.600 --> 30:27.600
Anyway, he...

30:27.600 --> 30:30.360
He's a salad dressing guy.

30:30.360 --> 30:31.760
The salad dressing guy.

30:31.760 --> 30:36.440
I started doing Cabaret acts, and I didn't want to ruin my reputation with the owners,

30:36.440 --> 30:41.960
so I asked Sam to represent me, and that turned into him becoming my full-time manager.

30:41.960 --> 30:47.440
And then we became best friends, and then he ultimately got me to come out to Los Angeles

30:47.440 --> 30:52.000
for meetings and manage me, and he became like my best friend.

30:52.000 --> 30:58.080
And somewhere along there, I don't know what date that is, but what I know of Sam is that

30:58.080 --> 31:00.240
he's working with actors in this capacity.

31:00.240 --> 31:03.840
He was an assistant to casting directors.

31:03.840 --> 31:09.280
He worked on MASH in some capacity, like below the casting director, right?

31:09.280 --> 31:11.080
Well, this is how brilliant he was.

31:11.080 --> 31:15.920
He started out working as an associate with the casting director, and then he opened his

31:15.920 --> 31:18.320
own agency, and he came out here.

31:18.320 --> 31:22.240
And one of the first things he cast was the movie Network.

31:22.240 --> 31:27.360
And he started to say, when he got the script, you have to cast Faye Dunneway in this part,

31:27.360 --> 31:30.760
and they said, oh, we can't afford Faye Dunneway, and she'll never do it, and we have a little

31:30.760 --> 31:32.040
budget and everything.

31:32.040 --> 31:37.760
So they brought in every B actress in Los Angeles to read for this part.

31:37.760 --> 31:38.760
And they kept saying...

31:38.760 --> 31:39.760
For Network?

31:39.760 --> 31:40.760
For Network.

31:40.760 --> 31:41.760
And why is nobody good?

31:41.760 --> 31:45.680
And he said, Faye Dunneway, why won't you let me...

31:45.680 --> 31:46.680
She'll never do it.

31:46.680 --> 31:47.680
She'll never do it.

31:47.680 --> 31:48.680
We can't afford it.

31:48.680 --> 31:50.720
He said, just let me get the script to her.

31:50.720 --> 31:54.040
I promise you, she'll pay you to do it.

31:54.040 --> 31:59.200
And they sent the script to her, and she said, I don't care what it cost you, what I get,

31:59.200 --> 32:00.360
I want to do this film.

32:00.360 --> 32:02.160
Then she won the Academy Award.

32:02.160 --> 32:05.160
So then he opened his own agency and did MASH and did all these things.

32:05.160 --> 32:06.160
And he was...

32:06.160 --> 32:09.360
Sam totally demuried when I asked him about that.

32:09.360 --> 32:13.320
He made a song, he was just kind of an ancillary character in that story, but I didn't know

32:13.320 --> 32:15.320
that he actually helped cast that movie.

32:15.320 --> 32:16.320
He was the one.

32:16.320 --> 32:17.880
He was the Faye Dunneway guy.

32:17.880 --> 32:18.880
Wow.

32:18.880 --> 32:21.000
That story makes perfect sense, and it makes perfect sense that Sam never told it that

32:21.000 --> 32:22.000
way.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.440
I had heard about him being involved with that, but he...

32:24.440 --> 32:25.440
Yeah, he downplayed it.

32:25.440 --> 32:30.160
To give some context, if you don't know who we're talking about, Sam, when I was 24 years

32:30.160 --> 32:35.520
old, I had a girlfriend who had taken his class, and he does this kind of essence workshop

32:35.520 --> 32:39.000
where you find out essentially who you are.

32:39.000 --> 32:45.920
And you get seven kind of statements to describe exactly why you are who you are, whether you

32:45.920 --> 32:50.080
like it or not.

32:50.080 --> 32:51.080
And my...

32:51.080 --> 32:54.240
The girlfriend at the time said, I was broke, and she goes, I need to find the money, take

32:54.240 --> 32:56.760
the class, don't ask any questions.

32:56.760 --> 33:02.600
And I ended up doing it, and it really was the reason I started working, because you

33:02.600 --> 33:04.280
have this self-knowledge.

33:04.280 --> 33:08.840
And then I told Dan and Rob and everybody, and I told Drew Carey about it, and Drew Carey

33:08.840 --> 33:14.520
now still sent everybody, it's like, you have to find out who you are.

33:14.520 --> 33:19.240
And even if you think you know who you are, you don't have the permission to say out loud

33:19.240 --> 33:21.160
what it is that makes you you.

33:21.160 --> 33:29.120
And find out how people perceive you, because Sam's philosophy was, when you're on a playground,

33:29.120 --> 33:30.360
you're starting to...

33:30.360 --> 33:34.320
You're having this obsession with like, who am I, how do people perceive me?

33:34.320 --> 33:40.200
And the very things that make you unique, anything that makes you stand out, you're tall, you're

33:40.200 --> 33:45.360
short, you're black, you have freckles, but more importantly, your personality, you're

33:45.360 --> 33:48.920
sloppy, you're neat, you're...

33:48.920 --> 33:53.800
You're practicing being exceptional, and everyone else is practicing being everyone

33:53.800 --> 33:55.720
else.

33:55.720 --> 34:05.200
And you go into your adulthood with these traumatic labels about the things that people

34:05.200 --> 34:08.480
pointed out about you as you were developing.

34:08.480 --> 34:15.560
Because whatever made you different than everyone else, absolutely this is not...

34:15.560 --> 34:21.560
Society's job is to try to call you out and go, you're sloppier than everyone else.

34:21.560 --> 34:27.280
You're fatter, you're taller, you're weirder, you're slower, you're faster.

34:27.280 --> 34:32.080
But when you're a kid and you're developing, you're like, okay, I need to fix that shit,

34:32.080 --> 34:34.600
or I'm in big trouble.

34:34.600 --> 34:39.240
And it's right of you to want to fit in.

34:39.240 --> 34:45.000
But then once you hit 18, 19, 20, it's time for you to drop that shit, actually.

34:45.000 --> 34:49.880
Your body's designed to drop that shit, but society's not designed to tell you when it's

34:49.880 --> 34:54.440
time to let that go, because Sears and McDonald's are more than happy to step in and go, hey,

34:54.440 --> 34:57.200
you don't want to be fucking weird, buy a Happy Meal, like no one's going to tell you

34:57.200 --> 34:58.920
to drop that shit.

34:58.920 --> 35:03.880
Sam's class was telling you, okay, time to drop that shit.

35:03.880 --> 35:06.960
What sparks your shame?

35:06.960 --> 35:12.320
Go through his exercises, go through all your love letters from high school, go through

35:12.320 --> 35:15.200
your yearbook signings.

35:15.200 --> 35:20.320
We've been getting called the same names since we were children into our adulthood.

35:20.320 --> 35:25.920
And if somebody likes you, and let's say Dan, for instance, there's a way to describe how

35:25.920 --> 35:27.400
Dan is smart.

35:27.400 --> 35:33.880
If you like Dan, you say, oh, he's a genius, he's an intellect, he's a mastermind.

35:33.880 --> 35:39.880
If you don't like Dan, you go, oh, he's a genius, and I hate him.

35:39.880 --> 35:48.120
But being able to say in a couple words exactly how you're smart, Cody, and Bob, like what

35:48.120 --> 35:57.200
makes you edgy, or what makes you the neighborhood of how we would describe you as being witty,

35:57.200 --> 35:59.800
but precisely say it.

35:59.800 --> 36:03.440
And there's these words that we have all been called our whole lives.

36:03.440 --> 36:07.640
Like Sam pointed out early on when I first met him, and he said, Catherine Hepburn when

36:07.640 --> 36:14.400
she was 18, or 19 when she did Philadelphia's story, every review called her feisty.

36:14.400 --> 36:20.040
When she was 80 something and she did Angold and Pond, everybody called her crusty.

36:20.040 --> 36:26.720
If you're feisty at 18 and crusty at 80, what the essence is, is defiant.

36:26.720 --> 36:30.320
Isn't that like, you don't need men.

36:30.320 --> 36:37.600
And that's what made her great, was that all of her roles was, I don't need you.

36:37.600 --> 36:40.920
And if you're 18 or 80, it's a defiance.

36:40.920 --> 36:44.160
We have different ways of saying what's special about you.

36:44.160 --> 36:48.520
Their memories of what's said that's special about you on the playground are probably negative.

36:48.520 --> 36:50.600
Then you have lovers throughout your life.

36:50.600 --> 36:52.920
They find the positive ways of saying it.

36:52.920 --> 36:59.360
It doesn't really matter, and also crucially, it doesn't matter whether they're accurate.

36:59.360 --> 37:06.240
Sam always used the example of Goldie Hawn, who is a very, very smart actor.

37:06.240 --> 37:08.080
She could debate your ass off on any topic.

37:08.080 --> 37:09.640
She happens to be intellectual.

37:09.640 --> 37:15.920
When she was young, it was her, the way the public wanted to perceive her, the way that

37:15.920 --> 37:22.920
she would get gigs, it was like, people looked at her and said, you're an airhead, you're

37:22.920 --> 37:31.040
a bimbo, you're a blonde, idiot, whatever, there's probably healthier ways to say that,

37:31.040 --> 37:37.480
but that are equally not acknowledging the truth about her intellect or her depth.

37:37.480 --> 37:42.960
But if you're presenting yourself to the public and you're for public consumption, it's not

37:42.960 --> 37:47.440
necessarily a bad thing if people don't know everything about you.

37:47.440 --> 37:52.040
Right, because it's not the way you see you, but the way the world sees you.

37:52.040 --> 37:53.040
And that's what you have to discover.

37:53.040 --> 37:55.920
And that's what you have to step on that gas pedal and go, I always use the example of

37:55.920 --> 38:02.840
Louis Anderson, who would start his stand-up act, and he would do five or six fat jokes,

38:02.840 --> 38:06.520
and then he would pause and he'd wait, and the laughter subsided, and he goes, I start

38:06.520 --> 38:11.760
my set with a bunch of fat jokes, because I know, it's like, oh, it's so predictable,

38:11.760 --> 38:15.920
but also if I don't start my set that way, you guys are going to be out there for 45

38:15.920 --> 38:20.000
minutes, and some of you are going to be like, do you think he knows?

38:20.000 --> 38:23.960
And I always equated that with Sam's thing, where I was like, Charisma is Christopher

38:23.960 --> 38:30.920
Walken knowing he's creepy, Charisma is Jack Nicholson knowing he's dirty, Charisma is

38:30.920 --> 38:37.280
a fat person leaning into the, they're like, well, I'm not going to try to convince you

38:37.280 --> 38:38.280
I'm not fat.

38:38.280 --> 38:44.160
That has nothing to do with me endorsing body shaming or thinking it's better to be thin

38:44.160 --> 38:45.160
or whatever.

38:45.160 --> 38:52.680
It's just like, there's a weird energy you exude the day you go, well, I'm kind of on

38:52.680 --> 39:00.800
the same page with how I am perceived at first glance, and it kind of blows your mind, it's

39:00.800 --> 39:08.320
actually more likely that you're way off because of the amount of refraction, and I just remember

39:08.320 --> 39:09.320
the exercises that we did.

39:09.320 --> 39:13.320
Can you tell us about the airport thing, because that was the one that was really interesting?

39:13.320 --> 39:15.920
Yeah, I've said it on the show before too, it's like, just a rush through it, but it

39:15.920 --> 39:19.680
was like, that was my big eye opener, where I was like, okay, this guy's not full of shit.

39:19.680 --> 39:23.720
We went to the airport, it was pre-911, so you could just walk around the airport.

39:23.720 --> 39:28.640
And we would do this exercise, where we handed out forms and...

39:28.640 --> 39:33.640
Yeah, it sounded like the worst idea, like, oh, this sounds like a horrible homework assignment,

39:33.640 --> 39:35.640
to go to the airport with somebody else in my class.

39:35.640 --> 39:39.040
So people all around the international terminal are handed these forms and they go, so your

39:39.040 --> 39:43.480
classmates say, look at that guy, so that guy's me, I don't say a word, I'm just leaning

39:43.480 --> 39:44.480
into the pillar.

39:44.480 --> 39:46.680
Yeah, like standing 100 feet away over by a pillar and you go like that.

39:46.680 --> 39:50.200
And you have this sheet in front of you with 300 words on it, and they don't give you a

39:50.200 --> 39:54.640
limit, they don't ask you to engage like doing it right or wrong, and just circle any word

39:54.640 --> 39:57.240
that you think applies to that guy over there, right there.

39:57.240 --> 40:00.920
He's down with it, it's fine, you can stare at him, we're part of a psychology class,

40:00.920 --> 40:02.680
we would say.

40:02.680 --> 40:06.840
And so they'd sit there, circle, people from Poland, people from Memphis, people from Fort

40:06.840 --> 40:10.200
Lauderdale, like you're just in this LAX terminal.

40:10.200 --> 40:15.320
You do that for five hours, you leave LAX with a giant stack of papers, you go home,

40:15.320 --> 40:21.000
you tabulate everything, and then I'm like, why the fuck does everyone in the world think

40:21.000 --> 40:22.000
I'm sarcastic?

40:22.000 --> 40:23.000
And lazy.

40:23.000 --> 40:30.000
And you're just standing there, I went with a guy that looked like Charles Bronson, he

40:30.000 --> 40:36.760
was a weird dude, and we got in the car and we did like 50 of them, and he's going through

40:36.760 --> 40:47.880
me, he's looking from side to side, he's like, what the fuck, what, god damn it, what does

40:47.880 --> 40:48.880
everybody think I'm suspicious?

40:48.880 --> 40:52.640
And Schrab went into the weekend class with Schrab, you're not supposed to look at your

40:52.640 --> 40:56.520
cards when you go to lunch, by the way, you were told.

40:56.520 --> 40:57.520
What?

40:57.520 --> 40:58.520
What is it?

40:58.520 --> 41:04.520
So Schrab looked at his cards, apparently, because we did the same class, we were there

41:04.520 --> 41:05.520
for hours.

41:05.520 --> 41:10.760
So this is classmates writing down things about you, you take the class and your other

41:10.760 --> 41:15.040
classmates write shit down as you get this exercise, okay, go to lunch, that was my

41:15.040 --> 41:21.560
impression of Sam, and Schrab and I were walking down the sidewalk, and Schrab's like, and I'm

41:21.560 --> 41:27.160
like, what's wrong, he's like, nothing, what did you get on your cards, and I didn't look

41:27.160 --> 41:32.000
at my cards, you're not supposed to look at your cards, and Schrab's like, and I'm like,

41:32.000 --> 41:35.480
okay, obviously you looked at your cards, what's your problem, and Rob goes, I am

41:35.480 --> 41:36.480
not C-3PO.

41:36.480 --> 41:51.800
Waving his hands around with his elbows locked at 90 degrees, as if, as if, first of all,

41:51.800 --> 41:58.480
first of all, if I did that, I would be nothing like C-3PO, because he never did that.

41:58.480 --> 42:03.280
Anthony Daniels fucking, no, no, you're, you're embellishing to, to, okay, well, that's how

42:03.280 --> 42:06.800
I remember it, because you're Coney C-3PO.

42:06.800 --> 42:13.280
Sam, part of the class, which is amazing, is like, he gives you, you kind of find out

42:13.280 --> 42:18.000
mythologically who you are, and like what your myth is, like where you live on Mount

42:18.000 --> 42:22.560
Olympus, and what the story is that you tell, because all of our favorite like actor and

42:22.560 --> 42:26.960
actresses, they all kind of portray the same role in different ways, but they're always

42:26.960 --> 42:33.320
kind of fulfilling a same kind of myth, and I asked Sam, was it, what's your myth?

42:33.320 --> 42:39.160
And he said, mine is to remove fear, and, and if, you could say anything great about

42:39.160 --> 42:44.520
Sam, and there's lots of great things to say, Sam took fear away from people, and he gave

42:44.520 --> 42:46.360
you like freedom.

42:46.360 --> 42:50.240
He created this environment where I was, I was in my 20s, I was the worst version of

42:50.240 --> 42:54.080
me, and that's me talking, I'm already not a good person.

42:54.080 --> 42:58.880
Even me at 25, like where I'm like still cutting my teeth, being a human being, and

42:58.880 --> 43:00.840
it's like, but there was this space.

43:00.840 --> 43:04.720
Anyways, I think what we wanted to do is like, like we could have, we could have at any point

43:04.720 --> 43:09.520
talked about, oh, these are Sam's superpowers, this is why you should be interested in them.

43:09.520 --> 43:15.480
I think Bob, your contribution to it is, you were, you were very close to him for, for

43:15.480 --> 43:20.680
his whole life, and I, I, I asked you backstage, it kind of caught me off guard, it was like,

43:20.680 --> 43:25.360
when's the last time you saw him, because we saw him relatively recently, but you saw

43:25.360 --> 43:27.800
him two weeks ago.

43:27.800 --> 43:31.920
Well, he'd come to my house every Friday night and we'd watch Bill Maher and we'd cook,

43:31.920 --> 43:34.320
and one of the things, talk about taking away fear.

43:34.320 --> 43:35.320
Yeah.

43:35.320 --> 43:37.120
You know, I just got a soup maker, right?

43:37.120 --> 43:42.200
So I said, I'm going to make soup for you, and my new soup maker, which takes 18 minutes.

43:42.200 --> 43:48.280
So I make this soup, and he said, he tastes it, and he says, yeah, yeah.

43:48.280 --> 43:54.600
And I said, what do you mean, yeah, he said, it's, it's good, but what would make it great

43:54.600 --> 43:58.120
is if you added an entire lemon to the soup.

43:58.120 --> 44:01.800
So I squeezed the lemon into the soup, and he said, this is the best soup I've ever

44:01.800 --> 44:02.800
had.

44:02.800 --> 44:06.000
Well, he's kind of, he's, he's pulling a little trick there.

44:06.000 --> 44:10.000
He's, he's like, I think I'll create a story where I knew exactly what needed to be in

44:10.000 --> 44:11.000
the soup.

44:11.000 --> 44:12.000
Exactly.

44:12.000 --> 44:13.000
And then he's like, it was great.

44:13.000 --> 44:16.240
When you did Sam's class, the first part, back, when I did it back in the old days,

44:16.240 --> 44:20.800
like, and like when you still could go to the airport and do that thing, later it became

44:20.800 --> 44:25.880
more like online and internet based and faster.

44:25.880 --> 44:28.720
You would do the class, you would get your essences, and then if you wanted to keep going,

44:28.720 --> 44:33.400
you would do an acting class where you, you get a placard and you would put on a music

44:33.400 --> 44:37.080
stand with your seven statements about who you were.

44:37.080 --> 44:41.560
And it's the kind of the neighborhoods of, like, all the things people know about you

44:41.560 --> 44:45.560
on site, but you don't know that people know that, and it was just getting used to admitting

44:45.560 --> 44:48.500
that and knowing that people saw that stuff.

44:48.500 --> 44:51.120
And then you would do a monologue.

44:51.120 --> 44:52.120
So you could be anything.

44:52.120 --> 44:55.640
It could be a, I, I, I did something from network or you could do something from Shakespeare

44:55.640 --> 44:57.720
or whatever the, whatever the hell.

44:57.720 --> 45:04.960
And there was a guy in the class, it was a black guy, a really good actor, and he did

45:04.960 --> 45:08.800
this piece where it was like a really angry piece, I forget what it was.

45:08.800 --> 45:12.300
And he had a ball cap on and Sam goes, let's do it again.

45:12.300 --> 45:19.480
I want you to turn your hat a little bit to the side, and instantly the guy looked furious.

45:19.480 --> 45:22.960
And he goes, just do it again, and turn your ball cap to the side.

45:22.960 --> 45:25.760
And he did it, and it was the fucking best acting you've ever saw.

45:25.760 --> 45:29.880
And when it was over, he instantly put his hat back straight, and Sam goes, why does

45:29.880 --> 45:30.880
that make you so angry?

45:30.880 --> 45:34.240
He goes, I don't want to be thought of as the guy that has the ball cap to the side.

45:34.240 --> 45:38.440
He goes, you see how close your anger is?

45:38.440 --> 45:44.000
Like if you need it, all you have to do is be thought of or perceived as less than you

45:44.000 --> 45:45.000
are.

45:45.000 --> 45:48.880
Right, well that's the thing is like if people think that you, if you find out what your

45:48.880 --> 45:53.920
essence is, that's equally empowering if you want to play the opposite of it or whatever,

45:53.920 --> 45:56.360
like being able to tap into your stuff.

45:56.360 --> 46:01.280
One thing I'm curious about Bob now that he's gone, like you knowing Sam probably better

46:01.280 --> 46:08.320
than, than, than us on stage, like, how did Sam like, did Sam have, did Sam have, did

46:08.320 --> 46:15.080
like, where, where was he at, he was, he was this kind of guru, he had this studio in Burbank.

46:15.080 --> 46:19.640
My perception of him was always that he, he had plans to make it bigger.

46:19.640 --> 46:23.520
He would do the internet version, and he was like, he was trying to, he was trying to empire

46:23.520 --> 46:29.160
build, which I totally relate to, which I have tried to do, like, oh, I'm not enough

46:29.160 --> 46:31.280
that I'm just going to do what I do.

46:31.280 --> 46:37.440
Was Sam, was he frustrated about the business of being Sam, or was he content with it?

46:37.440 --> 46:38.760
No, he was content.

46:38.760 --> 46:44.000
First of all, he did a lot of traveling from, to New York and Atlanta and all over the country,

46:44.000 --> 46:46.400
and he'd go for weeks at a time.

46:46.400 --> 46:51.280
And that was very rewarding to him, because he blossomed this business to reach so many

46:51.280 --> 46:57.920
people, but it was a business of really having people center in on who they really are and

46:57.920 --> 47:03.520
how to maneuver them, their, their, themselves through life in a successful way.

47:03.520 --> 47:06.080
And that was incredibly rewarding to him.

47:06.080 --> 47:12.080
It just seems like such a, that's good, I'm glad that, because from my perspective, I

47:12.080 --> 47:17.840
always thought when I heard he passed, it was like, oh God, he never, he had just retired,

47:17.840 --> 47:21.200
and he didn't, like, it was such a thankless job.

47:21.200 --> 47:25.840
He just put up with a bunch of dipshits, like me, forever, like we just kept gathering

47:25.840 --> 47:30.720
at his feet and he would go, all right, Dan, that's an interesting choice in that fight

47:30.720 --> 47:32.000
club monologue.

47:32.000 --> 47:36.720
What, what, what do you like about your mother, my mother, what does that have to do with

47:36.720 --> 47:37.720
fight club?

47:37.720 --> 47:38.720
What color was your mother's hair?

47:38.720 --> 47:39.720
I don't know.

47:39.720 --> 47:40.720
Brown go.

47:40.720 --> 47:43.360
How's that working out for you?

47:43.360 --> 47:44.360
Fight club?

47:44.360 --> 47:45.360
Yeah, do it better.

47:45.360 --> 47:49.120
It just seemed like, by the way, I never chose the fight club monologue, fuck you if you

47:49.120 --> 47:50.120
did.

47:50.120 --> 47:51.960
Can we, can we find out your words, though?

47:51.960 --> 47:54.480
I want to know your seven words.

47:54.480 --> 47:56.320
Oh, I can't remember all seven.

47:56.320 --> 48:00.600
Bob, did you actually, did you, did you take Sam's kind of class where you got your

48:00.600 --> 48:01.600
essences?

48:01.600 --> 48:07.080
Well, I got my essences from living my life as his best friend, but what was interesting

48:07.080 --> 48:11.800
to me is when I started out in Cabaret, he said to me at one point, so who do you see

48:11.800 --> 48:12.800
yourself as?

48:12.800 --> 48:15.840
And it was in the days of Bonnie and Clyde with Warren Beatty.

48:15.840 --> 48:18.440
And I said, well, I think I'm the Warren Beatty of song.

48:18.440 --> 48:20.040
And he said, you're not.

48:20.040 --> 48:21.040
You're not.

48:21.040 --> 48:23.120
You're the fade done away, I'm fine.

48:23.120 --> 48:25.080
You're the fade done away.

48:25.080 --> 48:29.720
So he said, he said, so here's the thing.

48:29.720 --> 48:32.120
He said, you're in God's spell.

48:32.120 --> 48:34.520
You get laughs every night.

48:34.520 --> 48:41.240
Now what you have to do is start talking between numbers in this act and be who you are with

48:41.240 --> 48:47.360
your humor instead of just singing one song to the next song to the next song, which helped

48:47.360 --> 48:49.000
me discover who I was.

48:49.000 --> 48:54.040
And then once I was authentically me, I was able to attract people in record companies

48:54.040 --> 48:58.360
to be interested in me because I wasn't trying to be Warren Beatty anymore.

48:58.360 --> 49:02.080
Even though in my mind, I was secretly wishing I could be.

49:02.080 --> 49:07.160
We all have that person that we target, we think, like, oh, I wish I was like them.

49:07.160 --> 49:11.680
And the curious thing is that you might, by virtue of some random experience, you might

49:11.680 --> 49:15.120
actually find yourself being someone else's thing.

49:15.120 --> 49:19.640
And what a crime it is that that person's looking at someone who's thinking, I wish

49:19.640 --> 49:24.840
I was Bill Murray, like, well, that person doesn't wish you that you were Bill Murray.

49:24.840 --> 49:27.040
That person may or may not know who Bill Murray is.

49:27.040 --> 49:32.280
It's like, I always wonder where you're supposed to draw those lines.

49:32.280 --> 49:37.960
We have these mentors, these figures, oh, I had an epiphany while I was watching this

49:37.960 --> 49:41.800
person do stand-up or perform, like, I wish I was Garry Shandling.

49:41.800 --> 49:45.760
I wish I was David Foster Wallace.

49:45.760 --> 49:46.760
I wish I was this.

49:46.760 --> 49:47.760
I wish I was that.

49:47.760 --> 49:50.640
Like, what are you supposed to construct your identity out of if it's not other primates

49:50.640 --> 49:54.120
around you who have done things that you've admired?

49:54.120 --> 49:58.160
And yet somewhere within there, you're supposed to just be yourself.

49:58.160 --> 50:00.960
And it's the most useless advice in the world.

50:00.960 --> 50:04.720
But Sam somehow was able to get into that yoke.

50:04.720 --> 50:09.920
I remember like half of your essences, Dan, and probably like a few of yours, Rob.

50:09.920 --> 50:14.880
But like when, because I took it first, and then you start telling everybody, go take

50:14.880 --> 50:17.480
this class whether you're an actor or not.

50:17.480 --> 50:22.160
Like it's really valuable no matter what you do, like that self-knowledge thing.

50:22.160 --> 50:27.560
And it sounds culty to talk about, but it really was, this is beautiful.

50:27.560 --> 50:32.520
There's no way to express how much Sam means to people.

50:32.520 --> 50:33.520
It was super culty.

50:33.520 --> 50:39.720
But like when Rob took it, like, when I got my essences, Sam tells me, he's like, there's

50:39.720 --> 50:43.320
going to be one essence that's going to be kind of an epiphany for you that you're going

50:43.320 --> 50:46.360
to go, oh, that's how I say that.

50:46.360 --> 50:51.440
And he told me, like, we were trying to talk about my, the neighborhood of my poise or

50:51.440 --> 50:53.400
my confidence.

50:53.400 --> 50:54.920
And if you don't like me, I'm arrogant.

50:54.920 --> 50:56.360
If you like me, I'm poised.

50:56.360 --> 50:58.360
If you, like, there's that thing.

50:58.360 --> 51:02.120
And he wrote down a thing, and he put on a piece of paper and slid it across the desk.

51:02.120 --> 51:06.120
He goes, anybody else would hate this, but I think you're going to like it.

51:06.120 --> 51:11.760
And it was the neighborhood of my confidence or cockiness or whatever.

51:11.760 --> 51:16.600
And it was not conceded, just convinced.

51:16.600 --> 51:18.800
And I hit the fucking desk, I go, exactly.

51:18.800 --> 51:21.240
I said, I don't think I'm better than you.

51:21.240 --> 51:22.760
I know I'm better than you.

51:22.760 --> 51:25.080
And we're like, I almost started crying.

51:25.080 --> 51:31.240
And the one that Rob had, my favorite one for you, Rob, last puppy at the pound.

51:31.240 --> 51:36.320
Love it, that's great.

51:36.320 --> 51:37.320
That's not the one.

51:37.320 --> 51:38.320
I see that one.

51:38.320 --> 51:39.320
I don't, I don't.

51:39.320 --> 51:40.320
I love that.

51:40.320 --> 51:43.280
Rob's that I remember is waiting for permission.

51:43.280 --> 51:46.520
Also my favorite, my other favorite is Little Green Man.

51:46.520 --> 51:47.520
Yeah.

51:47.520 --> 51:49.320
Like you're from outer space.

51:49.320 --> 51:53.280
And then next year, you dressed up as Little Green Man for Halloween, and it was the best

51:53.280 --> 51:54.280
outfit of all time.

51:54.280 --> 51:55.280
That's true.

51:55.280 --> 51:56.280
It was a good one.

51:56.280 --> 51:59.560
And what about, fuck the dog, but won't admit it?

51:59.560 --> 52:00.560
He got you on that one.

52:00.560 --> 52:01.560
You're doing this again.

52:01.560 --> 52:02.560
I love that.

52:02.560 --> 52:03.560
Yeah, you're doing this.

52:03.560 --> 52:04.560
This is what you're doing.

52:04.560 --> 52:12.600
Some of Harmon's, the overwriting one for me is, and it sounds weird, but it's perfect.

52:12.600 --> 52:17.680
It's mud monster on shore leave.

52:17.680 --> 52:18.680
That's the one that I like.

52:18.680 --> 52:23.200
Well, Sam would say, some of these are your own.

52:23.200 --> 52:25.200
It doesn't need to make sense to other people.

52:25.200 --> 52:26.880
It's for you to recalibrate.

52:26.880 --> 52:31.840
And actually I forgot, I refer to last year being rough for me, and it's precisely because

52:31.840 --> 52:32.840
I forgot.

52:32.840 --> 52:40.720
It's like, oh god, you're a mud monster on shore leave, which to me means your story

52:40.720 --> 52:47.200
doesn't get to be about, like, all right, well, whatever.

52:47.200 --> 52:48.200
Sam.

52:48.200 --> 52:54.960
The other ones of Dan's unspeakable sadness came alone and leaving likewise.

52:54.960 --> 52:56.960
I love that one.

52:56.960 --> 53:04.520
Yeah, they were rough, but that's not, yeah, some people, you don't get the essences you

53:04.520 --> 53:05.520
want.

53:05.520 --> 53:06.520
You get the ones you need.

53:06.520 --> 53:08.440
Can I ask you a question?

53:08.440 --> 53:12.920
Some of these are so poetic that you're saying there was a list of 300 that people would

53:12.920 --> 53:14.880
circle, so these were written by them.

53:14.880 --> 53:15.880
Those are just words.

53:15.880 --> 53:16.880
The words would be like sarcastic, lazy.

53:16.880 --> 53:21.200
You would get there, you would collate all this information, and you would find out,

53:21.200 --> 53:24.240
like, okay, everybody's calling you sarcastic or sardonic, witty.

53:24.240 --> 53:26.360
I know, but like, mud monster on shore leave.

53:26.360 --> 53:27.360
But Sam would just write it down.

53:27.360 --> 53:32.520
Sam would just, he would make these pitches, he'd slide them across the table.

53:32.520 --> 53:33.520
Look at that.

53:33.520 --> 53:38.880
And I'd go, oh, the evolution of that was like, the mud monsters always welcome at the ball

53:38.880 --> 53:39.880
or something like that.

53:39.880 --> 53:46.240
It was sort of like, and I was like, yeah, but I don't, I don't, I suppose he is, but

53:46.240 --> 53:47.240
I would do a monologue.

53:47.240 --> 53:48.240
Give a fuck.

53:48.240 --> 53:51.800
I brought a monologue in for the acting class, like after that, a whole process, and it was

53:51.800 --> 53:58.160
like this tough guy, asshole, like, like kind of a mean, angry monologue, and I was trying

53:58.160 --> 53:59.160
to be a tough guy.

53:59.160 --> 54:01.720
And he goes, okay, Jeff, that was good, let's do it again.

54:01.720 --> 54:06.280
And you have your card up, you're placard with all your essences on it, which is, you

54:06.280 --> 54:11.640
know, kind of like, you feel very exposed, because you're proud of some, embarrassed

54:11.640 --> 54:14.120
by others, but they're there.

54:14.120 --> 54:20.320
And he goes, Jeff, why is, because one of my essences was dashing, pardon, dashing.

54:20.320 --> 54:22.240
It gets you choked up how dashing you are.

54:22.240 --> 54:23.240
No, sorry.

54:23.240 --> 54:24.240
See?

54:24.240 --> 54:26.440
Isn't that dashing him?

54:26.440 --> 54:28.120
And he goes, Jeff, why is dashing on that?

54:28.120 --> 54:29.120
I go, I don't like that one.

54:29.120 --> 54:32.720
That's why, because someone, someone that's dashing wouldn't say they're dashing.

54:32.720 --> 54:34.680
And he goes, do it again.

54:34.680 --> 54:41.000
And I did it as dashing, you know, and it was way scarier, like, like, if you just like

54:41.000 --> 54:42.320
own anything.

54:42.320 --> 54:47.360
He told one guy, he goes, do it again, but sit on your hands.

54:47.360 --> 54:50.160
He goes, you can't use your hands, now do it.

54:50.160 --> 54:53.080
And it was the most terrifying thing in the world.

54:53.080 --> 54:58.040
He just had this way to bring out something by the turn of your hat, or a little thing.

54:58.040 --> 55:03.200
Or like, if it was Randy, and you go, do it, like, see the way you're tilting your head?

55:03.200 --> 55:06.680
Like, why do you, like, why do you do that?

55:06.680 --> 55:08.240
I always do it.

55:08.240 --> 55:09.240
Now start.

55:09.240 --> 55:17.440
And then, like, it brings out the stuff, like, he's like, you, your tears, like, if people

55:17.440 --> 55:22.600
that think they can't cry on camera, or can't cry on command, like, in a play or a TV show

55:22.600 --> 55:27.880
or a film, it's so close to the surface, like, really, all you have to do is slightly scratch

55:27.880 --> 55:32.320
the surface and just say, what, why do you tilt your head?

55:32.320 --> 55:33.320
Why are you listening like that?

55:33.320 --> 55:34.920
I always do.

55:34.920 --> 55:37.200
And there's tears that come from that.

55:37.200 --> 55:45.000
And like, he had this ability to absolutely draw humanity out of yourself that you think

55:45.000 --> 55:49.840
shouldn't be there, couldn't be there, you're not allowed to possess it, or it's too far

55:49.840 --> 55:50.840
away to own.

55:50.840 --> 55:57.920
Like, he just had this ability, I mean, I'll fucking start crying.

55:57.920 --> 55:58.920
Like he...

55:58.920 --> 56:12.560
But, Bob, what do you think, like, okay, we've lost Sam, nobody leaves, nobody gets to, like,

56:12.560 --> 56:18.080
go, oh, I'm scheduled to leave a month from now, here's what I got to say, goodbye, I'm

56:18.080 --> 56:24.560
packing my things, like, it sounds like he left kind of weirdly peacefully, relatively

56:24.560 --> 56:32.320
young man to, as you described it, he said he was at the home of his partner and he just

56:32.320 --> 56:37.640
said, I feel faint and he laid his head down on the table and he was gone.

56:37.640 --> 56:40.520
But how old was he again?

56:40.520 --> 56:41.520
70.

56:41.520 --> 56:46.160
Which, I hope, is the new 50, for my sake.

56:46.160 --> 56:52.600
I thought, I always thought, I felt like Sam was 60 when I was 25, and he looked 60 the

56:52.600 --> 57:00.720
last time I saw him a couple of months ago, he was, anyways, but he, for a guy that was,

57:00.720 --> 57:06.280
he was always like, he took other people's fear away, he was interested in them, no matter

57:06.280 --> 57:12.520
how much of a schmendrick they were, he was so non-judgmental, or at least he just gave

57:12.520 --> 57:19.000
everybody a chance to figure out who the fuck they were.

57:19.000 --> 57:24.560
Now that he's gone, do you feel a door closing where you're like, oh shit, what did Sam want

57:24.560 --> 57:25.800
from me?

57:25.800 --> 57:27.280
Does that make sense?

57:27.280 --> 57:32.520
Is there something that you worry about personally that you're like, oh shit, if Sam had known

57:32.520 --> 57:38.920
he was going to take off, and I had had a chance to say to him, hey, not to be even more selfish

57:38.920 --> 57:46.040
than I was our entire relationship, but any final thoughts?

57:46.040 --> 57:49.560
That he might have given you some advice or given you an idea?

57:49.560 --> 57:54.400
I don't feel that there were things that were unfinished between us, because we were always

57:54.400 --> 57:59.480
vocal about how important we were to each other in our lives.

57:59.480 --> 58:07.160
He was about to start a new chapter, because he had bought a house in Asheville, in North

58:07.160 --> 58:08.160
Carolina.

58:08.160 --> 58:10.640
Nailed it.

58:10.640 --> 58:15.200
So there was a part of him that was beginning this new chapter, and I don't know whether

58:15.200 --> 58:19.520
that had anything to do with his passing, that it was the end of one chapter and the

58:19.520 --> 58:21.400
beginning of another.

58:21.400 --> 58:24.360
But I know how rewarded he was.

58:24.360 --> 58:29.120
I wish I could have said goodbye to him, but I don't feel like there was anything unfinished

58:29.120 --> 58:30.520
between us.

58:30.520 --> 58:36.040
We were always very vocal about each other, each other's lives, what was ahead of us as

58:36.040 --> 58:38.480
far as projects and dreams.

58:38.480 --> 58:42.480
You guys got together and you watched Bill Maher, and Sam was always very, he made no

58:42.480 --> 58:47.880
secrets about his politics, and yet his politics were sort of like, he wasn't like, to me,

58:47.880 --> 58:51.480
he wasn't like militant liberal, like, oh my God, we have to do something, but at the

58:51.480 --> 58:58.920
same time, he was absolutely unapologetic about an incredibly well-versed politician.

58:58.920 --> 59:00.080
So he's watching Bill Maher.

59:00.080 --> 59:04.320
He's obviously, he's able to put up with Bill Maher's personality.

59:04.320 --> 59:09.560
That means that you guys sat week after week, and you talked about his view of the world.

59:09.560 --> 59:16.600
And so I guess that's the related question is, I don't want to be as corny as to say,

59:16.600 --> 59:20.680
if Sam were here right now, what would he say to us knowing that he gets one last thing

59:20.680 --> 59:21.680
to say to us?

59:21.680 --> 59:25.520
But I guess that's, I don't know, something in that area, like Sam had an opinion about

59:25.520 --> 59:30.840
the world and the way it was going and stuff, like I, would he give it, like, we're like,

59:30.840 --> 59:35.720
hey Sam, what should we remember to do now that you're gone and you're never going to

59:35.720 --> 59:42.640
remember, remind us to do it again, like, I put that upon you, it's a really dumb podcast.

59:42.640 --> 59:47.640
One of the things that he wanted was for Trump and Pence to both be taken down and have Nancy

59:47.640 --> 59:48.640
Pelosi be president.

59:48.640 --> 59:49.640
Oh, okay.

59:49.640 --> 59:50.640
That's simple enough.

59:50.640 --> 59:52.640
We can get to the nuts and bolts of that.

59:52.640 --> 59:56.680
You know, he just felt like, let somebody who knows what the fuck they're doing be in

59:56.680 --> 59:57.680
there.

59:57.680 --> 01:00:00.160
It'd be funny because he's like Santa Claus, like, Santa, what do you want from the world?

01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:02.280
I want Nancy Pelosi to be president.

01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:05.480
No, make no mistake, I've got really specific.

01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:12.240
Oh, I need the 23rd district to flip.

01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:13.760
And he was predicting everything.

01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:20.400
Like he said, I think what's going to happen is that they're going to bring down Donald

01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:26.240
Trump Jr. and Jared and go to Trump and say, listen, this is what we're going to do.

01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:28.600
You better resign or this is going to happen.

01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:32.520
I had that prediction too, as of the Roger Stone indictment too, that it actually comes

01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:36.040
down to Donald Jr. that it's not going to touch Trump at all.

01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:40.800
I don't think that it's going to, I have that premonition, I've been reading like the experts

01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:46.880
kind of like speculation about this, I believe it actually, like, I do actually believe as

01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:51.760
controversial as this may seem that Donald Trump had no capacity to actually do anything

01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:59.600
but blunder his way into accidental treason, like he never was like, I get a great idea

01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:02.040
about like how to like be Dr. No.

01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:06.920
I think he totally thought he was just like, I'm winning and I know how to win.

01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:18.760
And I think his son, who is half as smart somehow, was way too far and like took meetings

01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:23.040
and left a paper trail and it's going to come to him.

01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:24.320
Happy birthday, Sam.

01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:32.000
We're talking about this, but that it's, I don't see it coming to, it's, that's, I

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:35.120
mean, that's the weird telenovela that I don't, how is that going to work?

01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:38.400
They're going to go, hey, we're locking your son away.

01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:41.360
And then he's going to go, that's all right, I'm going to pardon him.

01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:47.340
And everyone's going to go, yay, like pardon him later.

01:01:47.340 --> 01:01:48.600
So long, son.

01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:49.600
I'm proud of you.

01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:50.840
Like, like, how does the pardoning work?

01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:52.720
Like you can't do it until later, right?

01:01:52.720 --> 01:02:00.320
So like, people are going to watch him, watch his son go to prison.

01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:07.280
That's my prediction and it's going to, it's going to finally find the funny bone of this

01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:09.840
dead corpse of an empire.

01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:12.960
Like everyone's going to go, that's fucking weird.

01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:18.920
What do you think, you're just watching your son go to prison, like no wall, no Mexican

01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:23.800
is that important, but I can't fucking like believe what you're doing.

01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:35.320
What do you think Sam would, essences for Trump would be?

01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:36.480
What are Trump's essences?

01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:42.000
Like I, I search out like, like, like, well, just be like, like, like, like, he kind of,

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.440
he kind of spouts them out.

01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:47.880
I mean, I think like, like, like if you were, you could be a fan of his by going like, yeah,

01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:54.800
he said, he would be his, his essences would be like, I'm big, very big, or like, it would

01:02:54.800 --> 01:03:00.560
be like, like toy truck language, like, like my truck big.

01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:03.520
And it would be exactly why when you love him, you love him.

01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:10.960
If you love him, he'd be like, my truck big, like I get more candy, like I deserve all

01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:11.960
the candy.

01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:18.320
Or, or hemorrhoidal, hemorrhoidal, a little bit, with a little touch out of seven essences,

01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:22.560
like two of them would be like, they would evoke pain, like, like, like, like, how come

01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:27.680
Obama made me hooked on opiates or something, like, I have this kind of like thumbs sucky,

01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:30.920
like why is everybody picking on me, like just a hint of that.

01:03:30.920 --> 01:03:38.280
But most of it would be like, like, like, me, me, no share, me candy, like, and it would

01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:43.720
be like, like, yeah, that's, it's about time someone said that, because if, because I'm

01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:44.720
a fucking idiot.

01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:45.720
Now do me.

01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:50.120
Like, you're not doing, that wasn't a Trump, no, I'm saying, your essence is, as far as

01:03:50.120 --> 01:04:05.440
I can tell are, I love handsome people, I'm sorry, we're listening to this podcast on

01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:13.960
my phone, I will continue to hit snooze every 10 minutes, so that you'll never find out

01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:17.960
what the sentence was, because you just, you burned me.

01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:18.960
Damn.

01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:19.960
That's good.

01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:23.360
That's like, we're listening to the podcast and it's like, like, come on, it was nine

01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:24.360
snoozes ago.

01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:25.360
Get up.

01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:29.920
I only did it twice this morning, come on, you're being, I'm projecting a lot of shame

01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:38.040
about my snoozing, um, I don't know, don't put me on the spot, sorry.

01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:41.240
All right, what were, what were your other ones from?

01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:44.200
I don't remember the other, those are the only three I remember.

01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:45.200
Really?

01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:50.480
Yeah, I don't remember them, but the first, those, those top three were, I mean, well,

01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:53.520
last puppy at the pound, last puppy at the pound is a little green man.

01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:54.520
Yeah.

01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:55.520
Those two were the big ones.

01:04:55.520 --> 01:05:02.080
I think Sam, like, well, Sam's here, Sam's watching, Sam, now, then he goes away after

01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:06.320
the show, as far as this being on stage, like, when you, when you think of anything, Sam

01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:10.560
would like to see us do as an exercise or anything to show him.

01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:14.640
I think you'd like us all to have nipple rings that you can see through, that you can see

01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:15.640
through his t-shirt.

01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:19.520
He looked like Santa Claus, but then if he, he would wear it, he was like fucking ripped,

01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:22.520
like, like in this like bear daddy way.

01:05:22.520 --> 01:05:23.520
That is so hot.

01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:27.240
I think if you had nipple rings, and oh my God, I can see it.

01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:31.920
He would wear like polo shirts and he had this like kind of painted on beautiful white

01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:36.600
beard, razor sharp hair, and he'd be like, I want to tell you how you need to activate

01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:38.240
yourself and what you'd be honest with yourself.

01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:41.840
And then you'd like, if you squinted, you'd be like, this guy's got two pierced nipples

01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:46.200
underneath, underneath his incredibly tasteful polo.

01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:48.200
Rock on, baby.

01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:51.000
What year was your birthday that we roasted you and Sam was there?

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:52.000
30th birthday.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:53.600
It was for Dan's 30th birthday.

01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:55.920
We haven't, I think we have it on video somewhere, right?

01:05:55.920 --> 01:05:56.920
Oh, that'd be great.

01:05:56.920 --> 01:05:58.920
I can't wait for that to surface.

01:05:58.920 --> 01:05:59.920
Yeah.

01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:02.920
Can I do more than quit Twitter?

01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:07.000
By the way, I quit Twitter and then they fucking, all right.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:08.000
We roasted Dan.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:09.000
The timeline.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:17.560
And I said, when Sam was dating Ken Cortland, who's the best also, and one of Ken's essences

01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:19.560
was predatory.

01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:20.560
Yeah.

01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:21.560
Yeah.

01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:27.040
And when he said, he goes, I'm predatory, and he's like, oh shit, I'm in danger right

01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:28.040
now.

01:06:28.040 --> 01:06:38.560
I roasted Sam, and one of my jokes was, Sam gave me my, Sam is so old that he gave me my

01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:39.560
start.

01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:46.360
This is your joke, and it's nice to think that the guy that gave me my start also invented

01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:47.360
fire.

01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:48.360
Yeah.

01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:49.360
All right.

01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:56.680
I think it's, I don't know if things feel like, see, I'm kind of in a certain sense,

01:06:56.680 --> 01:07:00.880
he discovered me, which is very flattering because he also discovered fire.

01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:07.520
It's just a roast joke, and it wasn't worth the feeding, but to fuck it up like that is,

01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:09.080
and that poop scarf story.

01:07:09.080 --> 01:07:14.480
I mean, you went out of your way, like you, truthfully, with the way I heard the story,

01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:15.680
you were a hero.

01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:17.160
You made yourself a villain.

01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:21.440
It was so, because it was like- I think it's because she was like self-aware of being about

01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:22.440
how the story got off.

01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:26.160
It was just like, I looked at the scarf, and I was like, hey, why the fuck did I ever have

01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:27.160
to take any shit?

01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:32.840
I'm going to take this shit and fucking pawn it off on him.

01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:35.360
When I heard the story over brunch, I was like, holy shit.

01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:38.920
It was just like, when we went through it, she took, you took a shit on the scarf, and

01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:41.400
then you took it back.

01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:42.400
I'm sorry.

01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:44.360
I'm not giving, I'm not giving you notes.

01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:46.360
No, you are.

01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:48.720
No, I'm bad.

01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:49.720
I'm bad.

01:07:49.720 --> 01:07:54.720
No, mom, you're doing a great job.

01:07:54.720 --> 01:07:56.480
You're doing a great job.

01:07:56.480 --> 01:07:58.160
Thank you for- I'm so happy.

01:07:58.160 --> 01:08:00.800
Give it up for Randy Heller, everybody.

01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:01.800
Come on.

01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:02.800
Mama.

01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:10.040
I have a good story to share about Randy, actually, that I think it will make up for

01:08:10.040 --> 01:08:11.040
any character-

01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:12.440
To see him drive through it?

01:08:12.440 --> 01:08:15.600
I feel like he would, because I feel like one of my words is that.

01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:16.600
All right.

01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:21.440
Okay, so one of the words I would say that I am is the game that my mom used to play

01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:27.600
with me, which is called Wild Fish, and basically I would spend a lot of time in the bathtub,

01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:34.160
which side note, it was because we had a jacuzzi tub and I had discovered masturbating because

01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:38.920
you could sit up on the thing, and I had this book called Where Did I Come From, which was

01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:45.280
an illustrated book explaining sex to kids, which happened to- I mean, it was hot.

01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:48.360
It was like, you could spend time on it.

01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:50.480
So it was like, where did I come from?

01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:51.480
Page two.

01:08:51.480 --> 01:08:52.560
Oh, pussy.

01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:55.040
Page three, and you've got one.

01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:56.040
Page four.

01:08:56.040 --> 01:08:57.040
Check it out.

01:08:57.040 --> 01:08:58.040
No, no, no, no.

01:08:58.040 --> 01:08:59.280
No, no, no, no, no.

01:08:59.280 --> 01:09:07.800
It's a romantic tale about a mom and a dad, and they're kind of a heavy set couple.

01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:10.040
They're just like a normal- like the dad is balding.

01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:11.800
It's a very realistic portrayal of just-

01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:13.240
This is how I hit the jackpot.

01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:16.000
You do look a lot like the dad in Where Did I Come From.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:17.760
I don't know whether to feel good or bad about this.

01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:18.760
No, she's hot.

01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:19.760
I just mansion you into it.

01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:20.760
No, he's hot.

01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:21.760
He's hot.

01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:22.760
He's hot.

01:09:22.760 --> 01:09:26.520
But it explained, you know, when a mom and a dad or a man and a woman meet and are in

01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:30.720
love, I mean, this was before, you had, you know, this was just heteronormative, like,

01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:33.480
80s stuff, but it was still pretty hot.

01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:36.880
But they're like, mom and a dad, they want to get so close to each other because they

01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:37.880
love each other so much.

01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:42.880
So like, when they hug each other, the penis of the dad goes inside of the vagina of

01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:43.880
the mom.

01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:49.120
And then when it feels really good, it's like, it feels like a big buildup and then a release,

01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:50.840
like a sneeze.

01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:54.040
And somehow, this is just a side note, by the way, about the Wildfish story.

01:09:54.040 --> 01:09:56.120
Sorry, this has nothing to do with Wildfish.

01:09:56.120 --> 01:10:02.360
But as a weird thing, because I read that and absorbed it into my brain, now when I get

01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:04.120
turned on, sometimes I sneeze.

01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:08.200
And it's because in my brain, it got programmed in weird from that book.

01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:11.400
But anyway, so I love taking these baths.

01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:16.400
And then my mom would be like, and the Wildfish existed before I was aware of my sexuality.

01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:17.400
But anyway.

01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:18.400
This guy, like, let me book in this.

01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:23.280
I promise it'll be helpful because our couple's therapist was like, hey, let me just ask you

01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:24.280
guys something.

01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:25.280
Me and Cody.

01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:29.720
She's like, why don't you guys describe the, what was it like, did you guys take baths

01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:31.720
when you were a kid?

01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:32.720
What was that like?

01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:34.640
And then Cody, go ahead.

01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:35.640
Now explain what happened.

01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:40.240
So I love taking baths, and even before the book and all that, I just love being in the

01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:43.640
bath and pretending, you know, just playing and going on in the bath forever.

01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:47.400
So to get me to lure me out of the bath, my mom would be like, OK, we're going to time

01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:49.040
to play Wildfish.

01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:54.240
And she would get out the big duvet cover from the bed, the whole thing, the comforter

01:10:54.240 --> 01:10:55.240
from the bed.

01:10:55.240 --> 01:10:57.840
And she would, I would get out of the bath, she would wrap me in a towel and like two

01:10:57.840 --> 01:11:00.040
towels, one on my head, one on my body.

01:11:00.040 --> 01:11:04.080
And then she would wrap me up in the comforter in like a big dumpling.

01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:06.840
She would like wrap all of me up in there.

01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:12.560
And she would drag me around the house, like in this thing, over the hardwood floors.

01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:17.560
And she would do the voices of like, basically the premise was that I was a Wildfish.

01:11:17.560 --> 01:11:21.440
She was an activist who like was saving me from the zoo.

01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:25.360
We were like going through the zoo and she would do the different voices like a security

01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:29.360
guard would come and be like, ma'am, I'm going to have to see what's in the bag there.

01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:34.560
And she'd be like, oh, nothing, officer, this is no, this is not, it's certainly not a Wildfish.

01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:35.560
No.

01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:39.280
And she would like, and it was the most fun ever.

01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:42.440
And yeah, it makes me want to have a kid to play a Wildfish with them.

01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:44.200
It was really magical.

01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:59.280
And Dan, Dan, and I would go, uh, I, I remember the water getting very cold.

01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:06.000
And eventually going, hello.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:11.000
My brother and I would take real, real, real little, we would take baths together and we,

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:14.600
we had a game called pee-pee monster.

01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:18.520
And somebody would pee in the bathtub, but you had to, you had to stand up on the edge

01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:24.640
of the bathtub and try to knock, knock the other brother into the pee.

01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:26.880
Because the pee was a monster.

01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:32.760
And also because pee, the pee, like you're saying, like, oh, well, once the pee was in

01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:37.760
the tub, like you get up on the ledge, you're skirting the edges of it.

01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:40.920
Why did you have to avoid it because it was a monster?

01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:43.720
It's already pee.

01:12:43.720 --> 01:12:45.760
Why was the game called pee-pee monster?

01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:47.760
You could have said, stop at the first pee.

01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:48.760
Yeah.

01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:49.760
Well, one thing.

01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:50.760
I peed in the tub.

01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:53.760
I don't want to touch it.

01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:54.760
But is it a monster?

01:12:54.760 --> 01:12:57.520
Okay, now I really don't want to touch it.

01:12:57.520 --> 01:12:58.520
It's piss.

01:12:58.520 --> 01:12:59.920
You pee in a pool.

01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:00.920
What the fuck?

01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:01.920
Gross.

01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:02.920
Really gross.

01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:03.920
Really gross.

01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:04.920
Congratulations.

01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:12.920
You and your brother gross.

01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:13.920
Just gross.

01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:14.920
Sweet.

01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:17.280
I once took a shit in the tub.

01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:21.280
Remember, when Sloan was in there with me and she freaked out, my sister, we were taking

01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:23.080
a bath together and I, I mean, I was, yeah.

01:13:23.080 --> 01:13:25.320
She think it was a shark.

01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:27.320
I mean, I don't remember, but she freaked out, right?

01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:29.320
She was like, yeah, she wasn't not happy about it.

01:13:29.320 --> 01:13:30.320
She's like, I'm done now.

01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:31.320
She's 13.

01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:36.320
I'm done.

01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:38.640
Randy saved my life, you know.

01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:39.640
Tell it.

01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:40.640
Okay.

01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:41.720
Sounds like content.

01:13:41.720 --> 01:13:45.440
We were, we were walking and Sam was hysterical at this story.

01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:46.640
Everybody is, I hope.

01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:53.960
So we were walking out of a grocery store and this car comes zooming through the parking

01:13:53.960 --> 01:14:00.080
lot and Randy pulled me back and she started screaming at this woman in the car.

01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:01.560
She said, what's wrong with you?

01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:03.800
You almost killed my friend.

01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:09.760
And in the car was this very heavy set African-American woman with nine children.

01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:14.720
And she looks at us and she goes, didn't you see me not looking?

01:14:14.720 --> 01:14:22.240
All right, I'm going to get some emails about that one.

01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:25.280
Thank God we don't check our emails.

01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:26.280
You read it.

01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:28.160
I have an issue with H-Cow.

01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:33.720
That reminded me briefly, like you can say, no, I don't want to tell that story.

01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:41.840
There was a good story about Bruce Willis slapping you, like, okay, that's the whole

01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:42.840
story.

01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:48.600
But no, but it wasn't like, it was like, he was like leaning in the car on Sunset Boulevard

01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:49.600
or whatever.

01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:50.600
He's like, hey, what's going on?

01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:51.600
Where's the party?

01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:55.080
And you're like, it was like the eighties and you were like, I don't know, Bruce Willis.

01:14:55.080 --> 01:14:56.080
What are you?

01:14:56.080 --> 01:15:01.640
And then he like, what do you do that for talking to the microphone?

01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:03.840
He was very high.

01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:10.200
All right, well, let's call that the gossip section so that nobody like, I just, I forgot

01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:11.200
the world we're living in.

01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:14.280
I thought like, Bruce Willis called out for slapping.

01:15:14.280 --> 01:15:15.280
Was it?

01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:16.280
Okay, back up.

01:15:16.280 --> 01:15:23.480
So was it like a Pulp Fiction or Ving Reim situation where you're Bruce Willis and Bruce

01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:24.800
Willis is Ving Reims?

01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:29.600
Like you stop and Bruce Willis sticks his head in the car and just say, hey, you know, welcome

01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:30.600
to California.

01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:31.600
I'm Bruce Willis.

01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:39.520
He was like, I know who you are and he just slapped you and went, check it out.

01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:43.120
What did you think of that?

01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:49.280
And you were like, okay, well, that just happened.

01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:53.640
Or were you like, like, like, was it, it was, did it bum you out?

01:15:53.640 --> 01:15:54.640
Like you were.

01:15:54.640 --> 01:15:55.640
No, it was a shock.

01:15:55.640 --> 01:15:59.320
I was just sitting there.

01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:01.840
What was his, what, why did he slap you?

01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:02.840
What precipitated that?

01:16:02.840 --> 01:16:03.840
And nothing at all.

01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:05.600
Or just, he's just being Bruce Willis.

01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:09.600
I don't know, it's like to do with me returning a poop scarf or something.

01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:10.600
I don't know.

01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:11.600
I don't know.

01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:12.600
Yeah.

01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:13.600
He was coming out to make it.

01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:14.600
It was a playful.

01:16:14.600 --> 01:16:15.600
Okay.

01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:16.600
What the kids call it.

01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:17.600
He was negging you.

01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:18.600
He was negging you.

01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:23.240
Like, like it was like, oh, if I treat her, she'll go like, well, what's he selling?

01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:30.680
I was married and I, and I, and I, and I, if you weren't married, would you have, if

01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:35.280
you were not married, would you have, you know, probably, I don't know.

01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:36.280
I don't know.

01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:37.280
I don't know.

01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:38.280
I don't know.

01:16:38.280 --> 01:16:39.280
I don't know.

01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:40.280
That's such a random thing for my past.

01:16:40.280 --> 01:16:41.280
Yeah.

01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:42.280
Yeah.

01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:45.280
If I wasn't married, I would, I would fuck Bruce Willis.

01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:46.280
Oh, look, he's here.

01:16:46.280 --> 01:16:47.280
He's here.

01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:48.280
He's here.

01:16:48.280 --> 01:16:49.280
He's here.

01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:50.280
Bruce Willis is here.

01:16:50.280 --> 01:16:51.280
Bruce Willis is here.

01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:52.280
He's here.

01:16:52.280 --> 01:16:53.280
Oh, he's slapping everybody.

01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:54.280
Oh, God.

01:16:54.280 --> 01:16:55.280
Oh, he's slapping everybody.

01:16:55.280 --> 01:16:56.280
Hey, Bruce.

01:16:56.280 --> 01:16:57.280
Wait, what are you doing?

01:16:57.280 --> 01:16:58.280
Bruce, wait, come on.

01:16:58.280 --> 01:16:59.280
Take it easy.

01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:00.280
Bruce, it's a new segment.

01:17:00.280 --> 01:17:01.280
What are you doing, Bruce?

01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:02.280
Okay, go for it.

01:17:02.280 --> 01:17:03.280
No, be Bruce.

01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:04.280
Be Bruce.

01:17:04.280 --> 01:17:05.280
Oh, my God.

01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:06.280
And then he went to the next car.

01:17:06.280 --> 01:17:10.280
I was trying to build it out into a thing where you're like Daniel Tiger and Mr. Rogers.

01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:11.280
Yeah.

01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:13.280
Bruce, what time is it?

01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:15.280
Let's reenact the scenario.

01:17:15.280 --> 01:17:17.280
So, Randy, you're driving your car.

01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:18.280
Bruce Willis comes up.

01:17:18.280 --> 01:17:19.280
I was in the passenger seat.

01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:20.280
We pulled up to in front of the...

01:17:20.280 --> 01:17:22.280
Wait, well, first of all, eat the mic.

01:17:22.280 --> 01:17:23.280
I'm so bad about this.

01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:26.280
And second of all, vocalize what you're doing like...

01:17:26.280 --> 01:17:27.280
I wasn't driving.

01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:31.280
Like, I don't mean to feed you lines, but like, you'd be like, hey, it's me, Mama LaRusso.

01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:33.280
I'm on the Hollywood Boulevard.

01:17:33.280 --> 01:17:35.280
I'm not even sure if I had done that already.

01:17:35.280 --> 01:17:36.280
I don't think I did.

01:17:36.280 --> 01:17:37.280
Well, it was then...

01:17:37.280 --> 01:17:38.280
This is free LaRusso.

01:17:38.280 --> 01:17:39.280
Fix it, rewrite it.

01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:43.280
No, we just pulled up, my friend and I, to the improvist, Karen Brooks.

01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:44.280
You know what I'm saying?

01:17:44.280 --> 01:17:45.280
Karen Brooks?

01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:46.280
Yeah.

01:17:46.280 --> 01:17:47.280
You were going to the improv to see...

01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:49.280
No, I don't know why we were pulling up in front of the improv.

01:17:49.280 --> 01:17:50.280
He came out from the improv.

01:17:50.280 --> 01:17:51.280
Because that's where the strip was hottest.

01:17:51.280 --> 01:17:57.280
He came by and he put his head down in the car and he goes, where are you girls going?

01:17:57.280 --> 01:18:00.280
And I said...

01:18:00.280 --> 01:18:05.280
And first I said, shit, that's Bruce Willis.

01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:07.280
Wait, but you knew him from what?

01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:08.280
Moonlighting?

01:18:08.280 --> 01:18:09.280
What?

01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:10.280
Probably.

01:18:10.280 --> 01:18:11.280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:12.280
We're going back here.

01:18:12.280 --> 01:18:13.280
We're going really far back.

01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:16.280
And I just said, you know, we're not going anywhere.

01:18:16.280 --> 01:18:17.280
I don't know what I said.

01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:18.280
Where were you going?

01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:19.280
Were you going to the improv?

01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:22.280
He put his hand in the car and slapped me across the face.

01:18:22.280 --> 01:18:23.280
What the fuck?

01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:24.280
Was it playful, though?

01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:26.280
You were pulling into...

01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:27.280
Wait, it seems like you liked it.

01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:29.280
Why are they questioning me?

01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:30.280
You were...

01:18:30.280 --> 01:18:31.280
Was it playful?

01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:32.280
Why didn't you report it?

01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:33.280
Tell me what happened.

01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:34.280
Why didn't you report it?

01:18:34.280 --> 01:18:35.280
It wasn't before the days of Me Too.

01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:38.280
Okay, but was it playful or was it really hard?

01:18:38.280 --> 01:18:42.280
I think he was pissed off because I rejected him.

01:18:42.280 --> 01:18:43.280
He was pissed off.

01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:45.280
I would have slapped you.

01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:50.280
Learn to take a compliment.

01:18:50.280 --> 01:18:53.280
I think I might have mentioned this on the show before.

01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:58.280
He once knocked me over at a bar because I was with a girl that looked a little too

01:18:58.280 --> 01:18:59.280
much like Demi Moore.

01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:00.280
Yeah, there you go.

01:19:00.280 --> 01:19:02.880
And he jumped over a thing and just fucking...

01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:08.280
He hockey checked me up against the boards and I almost went to the ground.

01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:09.780
He absolutely nailed me.

01:19:09.780 --> 01:19:12.080
It wasn't because he was trying to.

01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:15.000
He saw a girl he wanted to talk to and I was in the way.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:16.000
He was right.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:17.000
Exactly.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.280
And he completely just fucking shoulder-checked me.

01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:23.280
What would be his Sam Essence for Bruce Willis?

01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:24.280
Douchebag.

01:19:24.280 --> 01:19:25.280
Come on.

01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:26.280
Knock it off.

01:19:26.280 --> 01:19:28.280
The poor guy.

01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:30.280
His only crime is being so visible.

01:19:30.280 --> 01:19:31.280
Wait, why?

01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:35.280
I think it's such a cool thing that I like to hear the way that he...

01:19:35.280 --> 01:19:37.280
No, but I'm saying what would he be?

01:19:37.280 --> 01:19:38.280
He says like, Douchebag.

01:19:38.280 --> 01:19:39.280
Oh, he's an asshole.

01:19:39.280 --> 01:19:42.280
Yippee-ki-yay, mommy issues.

01:19:42.280 --> 01:19:47.280
I really like Hudson Hawk.

01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:49.280
I like Hudson Hawk.

01:19:49.280 --> 01:19:50.280
I like that movie.

01:19:50.280 --> 01:19:52.280
You're the one.

01:19:52.280 --> 01:19:54.280
What would his Essences be?

01:19:54.280 --> 01:19:57.280
Hey, uh...

01:19:57.280 --> 01:20:00.280
Call of fucking California.

01:20:00.280 --> 01:20:04.280
All things considered, rather being Philadelphia.

01:20:04.280 --> 01:20:11.280
His Essences would be along the lines of some of the things that he'd be like, hey, oh,

01:20:11.280 --> 01:20:13.280
what are you doing over here?

01:20:13.280 --> 01:20:15.280
It's me, Bruce Willis.

01:20:15.280 --> 01:20:17.280
That's not an Essence.

01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:23.280
Oh, look, what's going on over here?

01:20:23.280 --> 01:20:25.280
I'm trying to...

01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:26.280
I'm coming up with it.

01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:28.280
Bruce Willis' Essence.

01:20:28.280 --> 01:20:33.280
Oh, hey.

01:20:33.280 --> 01:20:36.280
Sam Christensen is turning in his grave right now.

01:20:36.280 --> 01:20:38.280
Sam's like, you can do it, Dan.

01:20:38.280 --> 01:20:39.280
You can do it.

01:20:39.280 --> 01:20:40.280
I'm going to come up with it.

01:20:40.280 --> 01:20:43.280
This is Bruce Willis' top Essence.

01:20:43.280 --> 01:20:49.280
Hey, you put a plant in a pot?

01:20:49.280 --> 01:20:52.280
You get a potted plant?

01:20:52.280 --> 01:20:53.280
That's pretty good.

01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:54.280
Pretty good.

01:20:54.280 --> 01:20:56.280
Tell me I'm fucking wrong.

01:20:56.280 --> 01:20:58.280
You put a pot in a plant.

01:20:58.280 --> 01:21:00.280
You get a potted plant.

01:21:00.280 --> 01:21:02.280
What Essence is that, though?

01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:03.280
That's Bruce Willis' Essence.

01:21:03.280 --> 01:21:05.280
What do you mean, what Essence is that?

01:21:05.280 --> 01:21:09.280
What are you describing about him?

01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:12.280
Hey, you put a pot in a plant?

01:21:12.280 --> 01:21:13.280
A plant in a pot.

01:21:13.280 --> 01:21:14.280
Sorry, I fucked it up.

01:21:14.280 --> 01:21:16.280
You put a plant...

01:21:16.280 --> 01:21:17.280
It's about...

01:21:17.280 --> 01:21:18.280
It's for him.

01:21:18.280 --> 01:21:19.280
It's not for you.

01:21:19.280 --> 01:21:22.280
It's how he centers himself before an audition,

01:21:22.280 --> 01:21:23.280
which he doesn't have to do anymore

01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:25.280
because he fucking figured it out.

01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:27.280
Sorry, he slapped you.

01:21:27.280 --> 01:21:29.280
That's not cool.

01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:31.280
People shouldn't slap people.

01:21:31.280 --> 01:21:32.280
I'm confused.

01:21:32.280 --> 01:21:34.280
In the 80s, everyone was slapping everybody.

01:21:34.280 --> 01:21:36.280
A lot of people were drugged.

01:21:36.280 --> 01:21:38.280
I mean, there were nine people in the world

01:21:38.280 --> 01:21:39.280
and he was one of them.

01:21:39.280 --> 01:21:40.280
So it's like, what do I do?

01:21:40.280 --> 01:21:41.280
He was drugged, man.

01:21:41.280 --> 01:21:42.280
One of the nine people slapped me.

01:21:42.280 --> 01:21:43.280
He was angry.

01:21:43.280 --> 01:21:45.280
This is the problem I have with this story.

01:21:45.280 --> 01:21:48.280
So you're pulling into the improv.

01:21:48.280 --> 01:21:49.280
Oh, my God.

01:21:49.280 --> 01:21:51.280
Just listen to me.

01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:53.280
You're pulling into the improv.

01:21:53.280 --> 01:21:54.280
I'm going to slap you.

01:21:54.280 --> 01:21:56.280
And then Bruce Willis says,

01:21:56.280 --> 01:21:58.280
hey, where are you going?

01:21:58.280 --> 01:22:00.280
You're pulling into the improv.

01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:01.280
Albert!

01:22:01.280 --> 01:22:03.280
Was he wearing a vest?

01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:04.280
Did he have flashlights?

01:22:04.280 --> 01:22:05.280
Hey, where are you going?

01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:06.280
Maybe...

01:22:06.280 --> 01:22:08.280
I mean, there's a sign...

01:22:08.280 --> 01:22:10.280
Because if the answer is the improv,

01:22:10.280 --> 01:22:11.280
you get validated.

01:22:11.280 --> 01:22:12.280
You're pulling into the improv.

01:22:12.280 --> 01:22:13.280
I think what it meant is that

01:22:13.280 --> 01:22:14.280
hey, where are you going?

01:22:14.280 --> 01:22:15.280
Hey, where are you going?

01:22:15.280 --> 01:22:16.280
We're not going anywhere.

01:22:16.280 --> 01:22:19.280
You just see that part of the story trick me up too.

01:22:19.280 --> 01:22:20.280
I know what you are,

01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:22.280
but I'm saying he was probably saying like,

01:22:22.280 --> 01:22:23.280
hey, where are you going?

01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:25.280
Okay, I know what his technique was,

01:22:25.280 --> 01:22:26.280
because it was the improv.

01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:28.280
Okay, you be Cody's mom.

01:22:28.280 --> 01:22:29.280
I'll be Bruce Willis.

01:22:29.280 --> 01:22:30.280
Okay.

01:22:30.280 --> 01:22:31.280
Okay, so...

01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:34.280
Hey, where are you going?

01:22:34.280 --> 01:22:37.280
Oh, it's there.

01:22:37.280 --> 01:22:38.280
What?

01:22:38.280 --> 01:22:39.280
For the listeners,

01:22:39.280 --> 01:22:40.280
for our listeners,

01:22:40.280 --> 01:22:43.280
that was Robert rolling down a window.

01:22:43.280 --> 01:22:45.280
Cast your minds back

01:22:45.280 --> 01:22:47.280
into the foggy mist of time.

01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:49.280
A Jimmy Carter-era window got rolled down.

01:22:49.280 --> 01:22:52.280
Do you see how long the crank was?

01:22:52.280 --> 01:22:53.280
Jump of the night.

01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:54.280
The radius.

01:22:54.280 --> 01:22:57.280
Because apparently she was...

01:22:57.280 --> 01:23:01.280
She was in an Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme.

01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:05.280
She was also the size of a mouse.

01:23:05.280 --> 01:23:07.280
All right, sorry.

01:23:07.280 --> 01:23:10.280
Hey, where are you going?

01:23:10.280 --> 01:23:11.280
We just got here.

01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:12.280
We're going nowhere.

01:23:12.280 --> 01:23:14.280
Where are you going?

01:23:14.280 --> 01:23:16.280
The improv.

01:23:16.280 --> 01:23:18.280
Hey, you like improv?

01:23:18.280 --> 01:23:20.280
Yeah, we're going here.

01:23:20.280 --> 01:23:22.280
So you can't deny.

01:23:22.280 --> 01:23:23.280
You can't ask questions.

01:23:23.280 --> 01:23:24.280
Nope.

01:23:24.280 --> 01:23:26.280
Does this suck my dick?

01:23:26.280 --> 01:23:28.280
Yes, and...

01:23:28.280 --> 01:23:29.280
What?

01:23:29.280 --> 01:23:31.280
Oh, she's rolling up the window.

01:23:31.280 --> 01:23:32.280
I was just saying, like, he...

01:23:32.280 --> 01:23:37.280
You can't go fuck yourself.

01:23:37.280 --> 01:23:39.280
My point was, what the...

01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:40.280
In the fuck...

01:23:40.280 --> 01:23:42.280
All right, tonight's show's...

01:23:42.280 --> 01:23:47.280
That he picked that spot because it was, like, a thing.

01:23:47.280 --> 01:23:49.280
Like, he's like, where are you going?

01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:51.280
Your answer's supposed to be, I'm going to the improv.

01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:52.280
And he's like...

01:23:52.280 --> 01:23:54.280
We weren't going into the improv.

01:23:54.280 --> 01:23:55.280
If you want to improvise...

01:23:55.280 --> 01:23:56.280
Where are you going?

01:23:56.280 --> 01:23:57.280
Bruce Willis.

01:23:57.280 --> 01:23:58.280
Where were you going?

01:23:58.280 --> 01:23:59.280
That's what I asked before.

01:23:59.280 --> 01:24:00.280
I don't know.

01:24:00.280 --> 01:24:01.280
I don't remember.

01:24:01.280 --> 01:24:02.280
She was going to the improv.

01:24:02.280 --> 01:24:03.280
No, we weren't.

01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:04.280
She's going to the laugh factory.

01:24:04.280 --> 01:24:05.280
Where were we going?

01:24:05.280 --> 01:24:06.280
I don't remember.

01:24:06.280 --> 01:24:07.280
I'm just...

01:24:07.280 --> 01:24:08.280
You know what?

01:24:08.280 --> 01:24:10.280
We may not have been in the front of the improv.

01:24:10.280 --> 01:24:11.280
Oh, my God.

01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:12.280
Now that I think about it...

01:24:12.280 --> 01:24:13.280
We never.

01:24:13.280 --> 01:24:17.280
I'm just saying it was somewhere where we were pulled up for a show.

01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:18.280
I don't know.

01:24:18.280 --> 01:24:19.280
I don't remember.

01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:21.280
The story's falling apart, right?

01:24:21.280 --> 01:24:22.280
This was not even Bruce Willis' life.

01:24:22.280 --> 01:24:24.280
He probably pulled up to Bruce Willis' house.

01:24:24.280 --> 01:24:26.280
We probably pulled up to Bruce Willis' house.

01:24:26.280 --> 01:24:27.280
I pulled up to Bruce Willis' house.

01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:28.280
I'm going to call...

01:24:30.280 --> 01:24:32.280
You were trespassing.

01:24:32.280 --> 01:24:36.280
You were stealing his diehard gargoyles.

01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:37.280
Hey, what are you doing?

01:24:37.280 --> 01:24:38.280
Where are you?

01:24:38.280 --> 01:24:41.280
I had those built because I'm proud of being a diehard.

01:24:41.280 --> 01:24:44.280
You're like, I don't fucking know.

01:24:44.280 --> 01:24:47.280
He tried to grab them and he slapped you.

01:24:47.280 --> 01:24:50.280
What the fuck are you doing?

01:24:50.280 --> 01:24:52.280
I got two things I like.

01:24:52.280 --> 01:24:55.280
My gargoyles in my diehard mailbox.

01:24:55.280 --> 01:24:58.280
Now the truth comes out.

01:24:58.280 --> 01:24:59.280
All right.

01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:00.280
Mama LaRusso, the character.

01:25:00.280 --> 01:25:01.280
Let's dig in.

01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:02.280
Dig in.

01:25:02.280 --> 01:25:04.280
Is she Italian or Jewish?

01:25:04.280 --> 01:25:05.280
Yeah.

01:25:05.280 --> 01:25:08.280
You got to eat the mic.

01:25:08.280 --> 01:25:09.280
Yeah, yeah.

01:25:09.280 --> 01:25:10.280
The name LaRusso...

01:25:10.280 --> 01:25:11.280
The LaRusso family is very Italian.

01:25:11.280 --> 01:25:12.280
They were Italian.

01:25:12.280 --> 01:25:13.280
They were New Jersey Italians.

01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:14.280
And you're like, where were they from?

01:25:14.280 --> 01:25:15.280
Recita?

01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:16.280
What does she say?

01:25:16.280 --> 01:25:17.280
No, no, no, Jersey.

01:25:17.280 --> 01:25:18.280
Jersey.

01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:19.280
Yeah.

01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:20.280
And they were in Recita, California.

01:25:20.280 --> 01:25:21.280
Well, they were visiting.

01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:22.280
They were coming, not visiting.

01:25:22.280 --> 01:25:24.280
They were moving to Los Angeles.

01:25:24.280 --> 01:25:28.280
And they pulled up in Recita to a place that they were going to live.

01:25:28.280 --> 01:25:30.280
Tell me about Elizabeth Shoe.

01:25:30.280 --> 01:25:32.280
Cute, young.

01:25:32.280 --> 01:25:34.280
She was like 18, first job.

01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:36.280
How old was Ralph Machio?

01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:38.280
Ralph was about 22.

01:25:38.280 --> 01:25:39.280
What?

01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:40.280
No shit.

01:25:40.280 --> 01:25:41.280
No way.

01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:42.280
That was so fucking weird.

01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:43.280
He looked like a 14-year-old.

01:25:43.280 --> 01:25:44.280
Hollywood Light!

01:25:44.280 --> 01:25:46.280
That is so weird.

01:25:46.280 --> 01:25:51.280
I mean, first of all, to props to Machio, we're not age-shaming him.

01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:54.280
I would have assumed absolutely the opposite.

01:25:54.280 --> 01:25:55.280
No shame to Elizabeth.

01:25:55.280 --> 01:25:59.280
Because when you watch that movie through nowadays' eyes, you're like, oh, Jesus Christ.

01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:04.280
There were so few people in the world that we always had to cast adults as teenagers.

01:26:04.280 --> 01:26:11.280
And Elizabeth Shoe is gorgeous, but she very much feels like she's his mom.

01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:13.280
She was very mature.

01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:15.280
She feels like a grown-ass woman.

01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:17.280
He looked like his hormones had kicked in.

01:26:17.280 --> 01:26:19.280
Very convincingly, like 14.

01:26:19.280 --> 01:26:20.280
He was 22?

01:26:20.280 --> 01:26:21.280
He was 16.

01:26:21.280 --> 01:26:23.280
I mean, 22 playing 16.

01:26:23.280 --> 01:26:24.280
Wow.

01:26:24.280 --> 01:26:28.280
And when I got hired, I had to audition with him.

01:26:28.280 --> 01:26:32.280
And I walked out and I said, God, I'm only 36.

01:26:32.280 --> 01:26:34.280
And he's 22.

01:26:34.280 --> 01:26:37.280
Because he looked so young.

01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:39.280
Oh, did you feel like, yeah.

01:26:39.280 --> 01:26:44.280
So you get the call or your agent goes, got a part.

01:26:44.280 --> 01:26:47.280
The name of the part is Mama LaRusso.

01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:52.280
Was there ever, as a female actor, you have to go through.

01:26:52.280 --> 01:26:55.280
I've dated an actor or two here and there.

01:26:55.280 --> 01:26:56.280
Oh, really?

01:26:56.280 --> 01:27:05.280
I've experienced some existential crises where the actor goes, what the fuck?

01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:12.280
And they're like, why am I getting, why is my agent telling me to audition for this soccer mom and this Ford commercial?

01:27:12.280 --> 01:27:13.280
Oh, oh, oh.

01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:15.280
Was there a line where you?

01:27:15.280 --> 01:27:17.280
No, I was just happy to work.

01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:21.280
You know, I came to LA and that was one of my first jobs.

01:27:21.280 --> 01:27:23.280
I wasn't even thinking about it.

01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:26.280
I was just that he looked so young.

01:27:26.280 --> 01:27:28.280
And when I found out he was 22 and I was only 36.

01:27:28.280 --> 01:27:32.280
So I think, I mean, in the script, I don't think it was Mama LaRusso.

01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:33.280
No.

01:27:33.280 --> 01:27:34.280
I just want to, I feel like.

01:27:34.280 --> 01:27:35.280
What was the character's first name?

01:27:35.280 --> 01:27:36.280
I don't know.

01:27:36.280 --> 01:27:37.280
But I read it.

01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:39.280
I thought it was like such a little gem even when I first read it.

01:27:39.280 --> 01:27:41.280
You recognized that it was satisfying.

01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:43.280
Oh, I didn't think it was going to become like it did.

01:27:43.280 --> 01:27:49.280
But I said, wow, that's a beautiful story, you know, and great part for an Asian man.

01:27:49.280 --> 01:27:54.280
Pat Merida was only 17 in that.

01:27:54.280 --> 01:27:55.280
It's just super.

01:27:55.280 --> 01:27:58.280
I did this podcast on Whiting Wags with Jessica Gow.

01:27:58.280 --> 01:28:03.280
Like we, like it's weird, like millennials don't.

01:28:03.280 --> 01:28:06.280
Pat Merida wanted, did he win an Oscar for that?

01:28:06.280 --> 01:28:07.280
No, but he was nominated.

01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:08.280
He's nominated.

01:28:08.280 --> 01:28:13.280
Like try to imagine a world where Pat Merida, who speaks like you and I, he was.

01:28:13.280 --> 01:28:14.280
Not anymore.

01:28:14.280 --> 01:28:16.280
He was, well, not anymore.

01:28:16.280 --> 01:28:19.280
That's a ghoulish.

01:28:19.280 --> 01:28:21.280
You said I was like the devil.

01:28:21.280 --> 01:28:28.280
So he has a, like, and then he's playing this guy.

01:28:28.280 --> 01:28:31.280
He's cast for the shape of his face for his lineage or whatever.

01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:35.280
And he's like our confusing relationship with whitewashing and all this stuff.

01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:43.280
And like Pat Merida was nominated for an Oscar because he played a Japanese national immigrant.

01:28:43.280 --> 01:28:48.280
And he talked like this, Daniel's son.

01:28:48.280 --> 01:28:56.280
And in the midst of talking like this, which is one genealogy branch from being Mickey Rourke

01:28:56.280 --> 01:28:59.280
in Breakfast at Tiffany's, but he's Japanese.

01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:00.280
He's Asian.

01:29:00.280 --> 01:29:01.280
Mickey Rourke.

01:29:01.280 --> 01:29:02.280
Mickey Rourke.

01:29:02.280 --> 01:29:03.280
What did I say?

01:29:03.280 --> 01:29:04.280
Mickey Rourke.

01:29:04.280 --> 01:29:05.280
That would have been good.

01:29:05.280 --> 01:29:06.280
Fat check.

01:29:06.280 --> 01:29:07.280
I do that every day.

01:29:07.280 --> 01:29:08.280
Fat check.

01:29:08.280 --> 01:29:13.280
The modern lens was like, well, what are you doing there?

01:29:13.280 --> 01:29:14.280
You're not supposed to do that.

01:29:14.280 --> 01:29:16.280
Do you think it was racist?

01:29:16.280 --> 01:29:23.280
Well, I'm 46, so I was socialized not to, but like through a modern lens, you're supposed

01:29:23.280 --> 01:29:28.520
to go, oh, this is everything that's wrong with everything because it's like, well, it's

01:29:28.520 --> 01:29:34.280
very, very confusing when it comes to casting, like this idea of, oh, why did you cast this

01:29:34.280 --> 01:29:39.880
white person as this blah, blah, blah, when you could have cast this person, like it's,

01:29:39.880 --> 01:29:44.800
your brain kind of understands it to a certain point, but it gets a little confusing between

01:29:44.800 --> 01:29:51.560
generations because there was, I remember at that time, there was absolutely, there was

01:29:51.560 --> 01:29:59.240
no question of whether or not Pat Merida was very deserving of accolades for being on screen

01:29:59.240 --> 01:30:05.960
going, oh, Daniel, son, you should have do karate more better, oh, you do it this way,

01:30:05.960 --> 01:30:06.960
instead of that way.

01:30:06.960 --> 01:30:12.480
And then, and I'm not knocking his, because the whole point is he acted the shit out of

01:30:12.480 --> 01:30:13.480
it.

01:30:13.480 --> 01:30:14.920
He was doing a thick, weird accent.

01:30:14.920 --> 01:30:17.240
He was a stereotype.

01:30:17.240 --> 01:30:21.560
And it was, it put you in the shoes of this kid who's like, the weird handyman is like,

01:30:21.560 --> 01:30:25.440
hey, what's a, what are you, well, I'm Brooklyn, I don't know what nothing about nothing, and

01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:31.360
I went back to Jersey, all I do is do this, and he's like, oh, Daniel, son, yeah, you

01:30:31.360 --> 01:30:35.320
fix a sink, but you know, fix a soul.

01:30:35.320 --> 01:30:40.800
And it's like, the whole thing had this like chemistry to it, it was like, very charismatic

01:30:40.800 --> 01:30:43.640
and I don't know, why am I bringing this up?

01:30:43.640 --> 01:30:44.640
I don't know.

01:30:44.640 --> 01:30:45.640
No fucking idea.

01:30:45.640 --> 01:30:46.640
Pat Merida's dead now.

01:30:46.640 --> 01:30:51.360
Pat Merida was nominated for an Oscar for that, like, I don't know.

01:30:51.360 --> 01:30:57.720
I guess one of the things it brings up is that they redid the Karate Kid, they did the

01:30:57.720 --> 01:31:00.160
series and you were on that series.

01:31:00.160 --> 01:31:01.160
It's on now, yeah.

01:31:01.160 --> 01:31:05.480
I haven't seen that, but what's the deal with the Karate Kid series?

01:31:05.480 --> 01:31:11.360
Like, isn't Ralph Machio's in it, but he's not like the good guy, right?

01:31:11.360 --> 01:31:13.200
Well, they're 56 years old now.

01:31:13.200 --> 01:31:17.600
He's kind of like, isn't the series about kind of how he's sort of, is he straight a

01:31:17.600 --> 01:31:22.040
little bit in terms of values, he's not like a heroic innocent.

01:31:22.040 --> 01:31:26.560
He's a karate kid, so now he's like drunk on power doing coke and I hear he, he beats

01:31:26.560 --> 01:31:30.640
a few women in it and he's like, I'm waxing you on, I'm waxing you on.

01:31:30.640 --> 01:31:32.040
That's a great series.

01:31:32.040 --> 01:31:34.800
But the Cobra Kai are like sympathetic or whatever.

01:31:34.800 --> 01:31:42.720
No, no, no, it's, they're grown now, the two men, you know, Lawrence, what's the main

01:31:42.720 --> 01:31:43.720
to the blonde guy?

01:31:43.720 --> 01:31:44.720
What's his name?

01:31:44.720 --> 01:31:45.720
Billy Zafka.

01:31:45.720 --> 01:31:47.720
Well, what's a character?

01:31:47.720 --> 01:31:48.720
Johnny, right?

01:31:48.720 --> 01:31:49.720
Do you watch it?

01:31:49.720 --> 01:31:50.720
Who is that?

01:31:50.720 --> 01:31:51.720
Is that my husband?

01:31:51.720 --> 01:31:52.720
That's your, that's your husband.

01:31:52.720 --> 01:31:53.720
Oh, that's my husband.

01:31:53.720 --> 01:31:54.720
I had the same reaction.

01:31:54.720 --> 01:31:57.240
I'm like, whoa, big Karate Kidman.

01:31:57.240 --> 01:31:58.240
It's your husband.

01:31:58.240 --> 01:31:59.240
I can't even.

01:31:59.240 --> 01:32:00.240
He read the call sheet.

01:32:00.240 --> 01:32:01.240
Billy Zafka.

01:32:01.240 --> 01:32:02.240
Thank you.

01:32:02.240 --> 01:32:03.240
Not their rivals again.

01:32:03.240 --> 01:32:04.240
I had to run all his lines.

01:32:04.240 --> 01:32:05.240
His favorite color is green.

01:32:05.240 --> 01:32:06.240
For God's sakes.

01:32:06.240 --> 01:32:07.240
Get your shit together.

01:32:07.240 --> 01:32:08.240
You put me in the car.

01:32:08.240 --> 01:32:21.080
That's called Cobra Kai.

01:32:21.080 --> 01:32:23.080
Is everybody watching it?

01:32:23.080 --> 01:32:24.080
Uh-oh.

01:32:24.080 --> 01:32:29.840
It's doing really well.

01:32:29.840 --> 01:32:33.840
The good news is that response means eight million people are watching it.

01:32:33.840 --> 01:32:34.840
There's so much TV.

01:32:34.840 --> 01:32:35.840
It's just aerosol misted.

01:32:35.840 --> 01:32:36.840
It doesn't matter.

01:32:36.840 --> 01:32:41.840
Anybody watching Green River?

01:32:41.840 --> 01:32:42.840
No.

01:32:42.840 --> 01:32:43.840
See?

01:32:43.840 --> 01:32:44.840
Yeah.

01:32:44.840 --> 01:32:45.840
A million people watching it.

01:32:45.840 --> 01:32:48.800
And that's a show I made up.

01:32:48.800 --> 01:32:53.600
No, they're rivals again, and they're grown up now.

01:32:53.600 --> 01:32:58.080
And Billy Zaptis character has a dojo.

01:32:58.080 --> 01:33:00.880
And oh, it's so hard to explain.

01:33:00.880 --> 01:33:01.960
You don't have to.

01:33:01.960 --> 01:33:03.520
But they're rivals now again.

01:33:03.520 --> 01:33:04.520
Not going to watch it.

01:33:04.520 --> 01:33:05.520
Yeah.

01:33:05.520 --> 01:33:08.520
We've reached the part of the show where I'm so drunk.

01:33:08.520 --> 01:33:12.120
They actually did a great job bringing it into today's world.

01:33:12.120 --> 01:33:15.160
Just wrap you across the face?

01:33:15.160 --> 01:33:16.160
Yes.

01:33:16.160 --> 01:33:19.640
No, it's good.

01:33:19.640 --> 01:33:20.640
I think it's good.

01:33:20.640 --> 01:33:21.640
Yeah.

01:33:21.640 --> 01:33:23.240
All right, give us some John Hamm stories.

01:33:23.240 --> 01:33:26.200
You were on Mad Men.

01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:28.840
What does this dick look like?

01:33:28.840 --> 01:33:30.520
I heard it's very large.

01:33:30.520 --> 01:33:33.200
John, I hope he's not listening to this.

01:33:33.200 --> 01:33:34.200
He probably is.

01:33:34.200 --> 01:33:35.720
You know what?

01:33:35.720 --> 01:33:36.720
Big deal.

01:33:36.720 --> 01:33:37.720
I don't know about it.

01:33:37.720 --> 01:33:38.720
Oh, John, sorry.

01:33:38.720 --> 01:33:42.480
We're spreading the rumor about your big giant dick again.

01:33:42.480 --> 01:33:46.200
But here's a thousand dick-shaped violins playing for his giant dick.

01:33:46.200 --> 01:33:49.400
No, because everyone knows about it, because there are pictures and stuff.

01:33:49.400 --> 01:33:51.880
He's a tell-the-wigs story.

01:33:51.880 --> 01:33:53.600
Oh, you tell it.

01:33:53.600 --> 01:33:54.600
Tell it.

01:33:54.600 --> 01:33:55.600
He's a good at this.

01:33:55.600 --> 01:33:59.240
So Randy's having a four-hour makeup done to age her.

01:33:59.240 --> 01:34:03.240
And the makeup lady says to her, maybe I'm making up half the spirits, but it's fine.

01:34:03.240 --> 01:34:07.600
So the makeup says, I heard Matthew Wainer say...

01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:10.760
No, it's wrong already.

01:34:10.760 --> 01:34:15.800
No, so my character has this big wig and aging.

01:34:15.800 --> 01:34:17.760
They age me up.

01:34:17.760 --> 01:34:24.360
And there was a scene where I was wearing the wig and I had to...

01:34:24.360 --> 01:34:25.360
Oh, I tilted it.

01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:26.960
Oh, this is going to be terrible.

01:34:26.960 --> 01:34:27.960
I'm telling it already.

01:34:27.960 --> 01:34:28.960
I felt it better.

01:34:28.960 --> 01:34:29.960
Yeah, it's canceled.

01:34:29.960 --> 01:34:30.960
It's canceled.

01:34:30.960 --> 01:34:35.200
So the wig person says, I heard Matthew Wainer said, it might be funny if you adjusted your

01:34:35.200 --> 01:34:37.040
wig in the scene.

01:34:37.040 --> 01:34:39.040
So she said, oh, well, I think I'll do that then.

01:34:39.040 --> 01:34:42.320
So she gets to the first take and she adjusts the wig.

01:34:42.320 --> 01:34:45.320
And then they do the second take and she adjusts the wig.

01:34:45.320 --> 01:34:47.400
And she said to John, John, too much?

01:34:47.400 --> 01:34:50.800
She said, first take, yeah, second take, no.

01:34:50.800 --> 01:34:51.800
That was what happened.

01:34:51.800 --> 01:34:52.800
See?

01:34:52.800 --> 01:34:53.800
I don't really...

01:34:53.800 --> 01:34:54.800
I don't really...

01:34:54.800 --> 01:34:56.280
I have any John Hamm stories.

01:34:56.280 --> 01:34:58.080
It was great to work on that show.

01:34:58.080 --> 01:34:59.080
I had a great time.

01:34:59.080 --> 01:35:00.080
He's a good guy.

01:35:00.080 --> 01:35:01.080
He's a huge dick.

01:35:01.080 --> 01:35:02.080
And he's beautiful.

01:35:02.080 --> 01:35:03.080
And he is a big dick.

01:35:03.080 --> 01:35:04.080
No, I don't.

01:35:04.080 --> 01:35:07.080
In my experience, it's big, but it's weird.

01:35:07.080 --> 01:35:08.080
Yeah.

01:35:08.080 --> 01:35:09.080
Oh, really?

01:35:09.080 --> 01:35:10.080
It's a big, weird dick.

01:35:10.080 --> 01:35:11.080
It's shaped like an ampersand.

01:35:11.080 --> 01:35:12.080
Like a ham?

01:35:12.080 --> 01:35:13.080
Like a ham thing?

01:35:13.080 --> 01:35:14.080
Like Liam Neeson.

01:35:14.080 --> 01:35:15.080
Like a ham bone?

01:35:15.080 --> 01:35:16.080
He has an ampersand dick.

01:35:16.080 --> 01:35:17.080
It's just shaped like a...

01:35:17.080 --> 01:35:18.080
We're going down the hill here.

01:35:18.080 --> 01:35:19.080
His dick is like a treble cleft.

01:35:19.080 --> 01:35:20.080
Yeah.

01:35:20.080 --> 01:35:21.080
It's very curvilinear.

01:35:21.080 --> 01:35:25.720
And honestly, John Hamm, if you're listening or if any of your representatives are, come

01:35:25.720 --> 01:35:26.720
on the show.

01:35:26.720 --> 01:35:27.720
Clear your name.

01:35:27.720 --> 01:35:28.720
That's right.

01:35:28.720 --> 01:35:30.720
I'm going to challenge John Hamm to come on the show.

01:35:30.720 --> 01:35:33.720
Show us your dick.

01:35:33.720 --> 01:35:34.720
Take out a little bit to win.

01:35:34.720 --> 01:35:42.640
Let's get Bruce Willis and John Hamm, and we'll have Bruce slap John Hamm's dick.

01:35:42.640 --> 01:35:43.640
I still...

01:35:43.640 --> 01:35:44.640
Such an exciting career.

01:35:44.640 --> 01:35:45.640
I feel like Sam.

01:35:45.640 --> 01:35:46.640
Sam is watching.

01:35:46.640 --> 01:35:48.640
He's still like, you guys didn't do it yet.

01:35:48.640 --> 01:35:51.000
You didn't do that thing that I need you to do.

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
I didn't go to his class.

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.080
I should have gone.

01:35:55.080 --> 01:35:56.680
He needs us to be true to ourselves.

01:35:56.680 --> 01:35:57.680
Sam wants me.

01:35:57.680 --> 01:35:58.880
Sam was always like...

01:35:58.880 --> 01:36:03.920
I feel like when I went to Sam's class, the thing that Sam was always suggesting to me

01:36:03.920 --> 01:36:07.200
that I wish that he wasn't gone so that I could...

01:36:07.200 --> 01:36:09.560
I feel like I was incomplete.

01:36:09.560 --> 01:36:13.520
Sam was always saying to me, okay, Dan, but why don't you do that?

01:36:13.520 --> 01:36:18.080
But what if you weren't allowed to scream?

01:36:18.080 --> 01:36:25.400
Because I thought not being a very good actor, when I learned how to yell, I was like, oh,

01:36:25.400 --> 01:36:26.400
this is great acting.

01:36:26.400 --> 01:36:30.920
You're telling me, speak the speech, I pray to you, tripping like I'm telling you.

01:36:30.920 --> 01:36:32.440
Like, oh, I'm yelling.

01:36:32.440 --> 01:36:38.520
And then Sam's thing was always like, okay, Dan, but what if you were afraid to do that?

01:36:38.520 --> 01:36:40.480
What if you had to sit on your rage?

01:36:40.480 --> 01:36:42.080
How would that manifest itself?

01:36:42.080 --> 01:36:44.120
And I was never able to do that.

01:36:44.120 --> 01:36:55.040
All of my stuff was like how wounded I was and how dishonestly that would manifest itself.

01:36:55.040 --> 01:37:04.840
And I never got to, I don't know, yeah, I don't know, my memories of Sam, they're incomplete

01:37:04.840 --> 01:37:11.920
because they make me go, Sam, give me more attention, tell me I did something, tell me...

01:37:11.920 --> 01:37:16.760
I weirdly pictured Sam when I was 70 that Sam would still be...

01:37:16.760 --> 01:37:19.600
I never thought about him as having an age or immortality.

01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:24.920
I thought he'd be like hanging out and he'd be like, you did it, good job, you're 70.

01:37:24.920 --> 01:37:30.680
You did a great job at that eulogy, you did it.

01:37:30.680 --> 01:37:34.640
I was watching you on that...

01:37:34.640 --> 01:37:41.320
There's so many things that he said, just with one line, with one little statement that completely

01:37:41.320 --> 01:37:44.160
transformed the way I thought about things.

01:37:44.160 --> 01:37:50.200
And he told me one thing that I'll never forget, he said, Jeff, he goes, you make it all too

01:37:50.200 --> 01:37:51.200
hard.

01:37:51.200 --> 01:37:55.280
He goes, you overthink it, you're making it harder than it is.

01:37:55.280 --> 01:37:58.880
He goes, just do it, just say the words.

01:37:58.880 --> 01:38:01.440
He goes, you have tricks that you use.

01:38:01.440 --> 01:38:06.240
He goes, don't use them, just say the words.

01:38:06.240 --> 01:38:09.400
He goes, do it again and just say it.

01:38:09.400 --> 01:38:14.840
And then all the emotion comes out when you're not lying and you're not pretending.

01:38:14.840 --> 01:38:20.560
He just had a way of terrifying you into honesty, but without being terrifying, he never...

01:38:20.560 --> 01:38:28.080
Also, he said, when I first took his class, I sat down and he told a story.

01:38:28.080 --> 01:38:32.720
There was a girl that was in the class and it was the first day and he brought her down

01:38:32.720 --> 01:38:36.800
in the same way that he brought, when you first start the class, he'd just bring random person

01:38:36.800 --> 01:38:43.000
out of 15 of us, sit in the chair and he would just say, there was this woman that sat in

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:48.000
the chair, you're probably a 20-year-old girl, said, raise your hand the rest of you

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:55.440
if you think that she is the first one in the pool and the last one out and nobody raised

01:38:55.440 --> 01:38:57.040
their hands.

01:38:57.040 --> 01:39:02.760
And he goes, raise your hand if you think that her bedroom is everything in its place

01:39:02.760 --> 01:39:07.560
and right where it should be and everybody raised their hand and she started crying.

01:39:07.560 --> 01:39:11.600
And Sam freaked because he's not there to make people cry, he's not one of those acting

01:39:11.600 --> 01:39:16.080
teachers that wants to break you down to build you back up, he's never like that.

01:39:16.080 --> 01:39:18.000
And he's like, oh, shit, why are you crying?

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:31.400
And she goes, I'm an athlete, Olympic swimmer, I have three silver medals and nobody thinks

01:39:31.400 --> 01:39:32.400
I'm a swimmer.

01:39:32.400 --> 01:39:36.800
But if you look at it, Sam was like, if you look at her, short hair, the shoulders, the

01:39:36.800 --> 01:39:42.400
build, the tan, she looks like a swimmer, but no, because why don't people perceive me

01:39:42.400 --> 01:39:43.400
as a swimmer?

01:39:43.400 --> 01:39:44.400
I've gone out on a thousand...

01:39:44.400 --> 01:39:46.280
You're swimming, do I have to do?

01:39:46.280 --> 01:39:47.280
Yeah.

01:39:47.280 --> 01:39:51.240
And she said to him, and she's crying, and she goes, I've gone on a thousand commercial

01:39:51.240 --> 01:39:56.880
auditions as an athlete, as a swimmer, and last year I went out and actually brought

01:39:56.880 --> 01:40:00.400
one of my silver medals, which you're not supposed to do, you're not supposed to advertise

01:40:00.400 --> 01:40:01.400
that.

01:40:01.400 --> 01:40:03.440
And I still couldn't get a call back on it.

01:40:03.440 --> 01:40:04.880
And he said, do you have an agent?

01:40:04.880 --> 01:40:05.880
And she says, yes.

01:40:05.880 --> 01:40:11.600
And she goes, Sam said, go to your agent tomorrow and say, no more athlete stuff, it's behind

01:40:11.600 --> 01:40:14.880
the desk, everything in its place, everything just so.

01:40:14.880 --> 01:40:18.640
And he just met her.

01:40:18.640 --> 01:40:22.840
Behind the desk, everything in its place, everything just so.

01:40:22.840 --> 01:40:26.880
She told her agents that, she booked three commercials that week.

01:40:26.880 --> 01:40:33.120
Because he completely goes like, you're a swimmer, but we see you as something else.

01:40:33.120 --> 01:40:36.600
Goldie Hahn is an intellectual, but we want her to play an airhead.

01:40:36.600 --> 01:40:37.600
Right.

01:40:37.600 --> 01:40:41.200
Because that's what she's bringing to the mythological table.

01:40:41.200 --> 01:40:45.480
There was another story that fits in with that one, which I think it intersects with

01:40:45.480 --> 01:40:49.280
the Pat Merida thing, which is in an area that's sort of confusing to me, like what's

01:40:49.280 --> 01:40:54.000
our job as actors and what's our job as producers and casting, that there was a woman in his

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:58.240
class that she was like, look, I feel like I want to be an actor.

01:40:58.240 --> 01:41:02.400
And I said, she takes the class, and she's doing the exercises, and she's getting flustered

01:41:02.400 --> 01:41:06.080
and more flustered, and something is eating away at her.

01:41:06.080 --> 01:41:12.040
It's clear, and it builds and builds and builds, and then there's that class where she just

01:41:12.040 --> 01:41:16.560
sort of breaks down, and she starts, she just breaks down.

01:41:16.560 --> 01:41:20.960
And this is a story I heard third hand, and Sam goes, what's wrong?

01:41:20.960 --> 01:41:21.960
What's happening?

01:41:21.960 --> 01:41:25.520
And she goes, look, who are we fucking kidding?

01:41:25.520 --> 01:41:27.920
And then she described herself, and I can't remember the description.

01:41:27.920 --> 01:41:38.760
The part of the story is, she's like, I'm a 280 pound, half Filipino, 45 year old woman,

01:41:38.760 --> 01:41:42.800
and I decided I want to be an actor, what the fuck am I doing?

01:41:42.800 --> 01:41:47.680
She went on this rant that included like just this, her perceived evisceration of herself,

01:41:47.680 --> 01:41:52.600
which included just a functional cataloging of what she was.

01:41:52.600 --> 01:42:00.320
And Sam's response was, I want you to go home tonight, and I want you to take however many

01:42:00.320 --> 01:42:05.200
headshots you have left, put them each in an envelope, and write, don't open this unless

01:42:05.200 --> 01:42:11.320
you want a 45 year old half Filipino, blah, blah, blah, whatever she said, don't open

01:42:11.320 --> 01:42:12.320
it.

01:42:12.320 --> 01:42:13.840
Don't open it unless you want that.

01:42:13.840 --> 01:42:17.520
On each of the envelopes, I want you to send it to all these people that you sent it to.

01:42:17.520 --> 01:42:22.800
And it was the, she was the receptionist on Northern Exposure, which millennials don't

01:42:22.800 --> 01:42:23.800
know.

01:42:23.800 --> 01:42:32.120
There was a shot, it was like, that was that actor that was like, you're looking, it was

01:42:32.120 --> 01:42:39.360
just sort of like, I don't know how to file that, it's this story of like, that's what

01:42:39.360 --> 01:42:44.800
Sam's magic was, it's like, turn this thing that you think is an obstacle into this evil

01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:50.000
carnival ramp and leap into the sky and have everyone look at you and notice these things.

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:55.800
It's almost counterintuitive to what we now profess politically and philosophically.

01:42:55.800 --> 01:43:00.560
The things that we're trying to overcome is like, well, don't, you shouldn't be noticing

01:43:00.560 --> 01:43:05.400
that I look like this, and your first instinct about who I am is actually your problem.

01:43:05.400 --> 01:43:08.680
You should be actually finding your shame about it.

01:43:08.680 --> 01:43:13.600
And I don't know, I guess I always thought I would watch Sam grow and progress into that

01:43:13.600 --> 01:43:17.640
era and see how he reacted to it.

01:43:17.640 --> 01:43:20.000
I know that Sam was very internet averse.

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:24.960
He was always so, we would walk into class with our cell phones when they were first

01:43:24.960 --> 01:43:30.320
developing at a palm tree and he's like, Dan, are you a, is that your phone?

01:43:30.320 --> 01:43:36.080
Like, yeah, he's like, did you know that that consumes three times as much energy as a refrigerator

01:43:36.080 --> 01:43:37.080
per week?

01:43:37.080 --> 01:43:39.920
What am I, okay, okay, sorry.

01:43:39.920 --> 01:43:41.200
Class isn't started yet.

01:43:41.200 --> 01:43:48.480
He was like very, part of Sam to me always felt like he was, he was very sad to watch

01:43:48.480 --> 01:43:50.680
the world progress.

01:43:50.680 --> 01:43:54.680
He felt like it was becoming less and less human and stuff and I hate to beat a dead

01:43:54.680 --> 01:44:04.040
horse, but I guess I'm going to Bob and saying, tell me, tell me he went away not going, oh,

01:44:04.040 --> 01:44:06.480
Jesus Christ, you people are fucked up.

01:44:06.480 --> 01:44:12.640
The thing about when you got your essences and then you have to go in front of the class

01:44:12.640 --> 01:44:17.400
and save them all and what's amazing is that everybody in the, you think they're either

01:44:17.400 --> 01:44:22.160
going to boo or cheer, but what they do is they just laugh and they go, oh, it's so cool

01:44:22.160 --> 01:44:29.560
that that person knows, like there was a girl in my first class and she was just like really

01:44:29.560 --> 01:44:37.360
like good looking like Latina and she hated one of her essences and it was Hot Tamale

01:44:37.360 --> 01:44:40.160
and she's like, I fucking hate this one.

01:44:40.160 --> 01:44:41.160
I fucking hate it.

01:44:41.160 --> 01:44:42.160
I hate it.

01:44:42.160 --> 01:44:45.360
We're all dying laughing and he goes, why do you hate it?

01:44:45.360 --> 01:44:51.360
She goes, because I've been called Hot Tamale my entire life and you always will be, but

01:44:51.360 --> 01:44:55.440
you have to, like there's two stages.

01:44:55.440 --> 01:44:59.240
It's acknowledging it and then embracing it and you have to throw your arms and go fuck

01:44:59.240 --> 01:45:00.240
it.

01:45:00.240 --> 01:45:07.400
I'm a Hot Tamale or Goldie Hahn has to embrace the fact that she's like America's airhead

01:45:07.400 --> 01:45:14.400
even though she's like a giant intellect and a church just sent me an awesome quote from

01:45:14.400 --> 01:45:20.480
Nick Cave, embrace your flaws, they're the only thing of, they're the only thing of interest

01:45:20.480 --> 01:45:27.240
that you have, like your flaws are what makes you and that's absolutely, like Sam would

01:45:27.240 --> 01:45:32.920
have absolutely dug that because that's what he, he just had a way of like looking at

01:45:32.920 --> 01:45:38.480
you and going, Jeff, someone said, hey, I sent someone to his class and I sent a million

01:45:38.480 --> 01:45:42.920
people to his class and if you like spread it all out, my first girlfriend that sent

01:45:42.920 --> 01:45:46.360
me there, there must have been a thousand people that went there including like, you

01:45:46.360 --> 01:45:55.600
know, you guys, a fuck, I've lost my train of thought, he had a way of just like, oh,

01:45:55.600 --> 01:46:00.960
so I said, I sent somebody to the class and my friend called me up and he goes, hey, Sam

01:46:00.960 --> 01:46:08.120
says hi and he also said, tell Jeff he's an asshole and he'll get it.

01:46:08.120 --> 01:46:13.840
And I laughed because like, he's like, tell Jeff, you're an asshole and that's Sam going

01:46:13.840 --> 01:46:17.760
like remind him that he should call me more.

01:46:17.760 --> 01:46:24.840
Like he only spoke to you in truth and absolutely essentially and it's the best.

01:46:24.840 --> 01:46:31.040
I feel like for me, Sam was the anchor of everything.

01:46:31.040 --> 01:46:36.000
When everything was going through your mind that you needed help with, that you needed

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:42.240
advice on, that you needed a perspective on that you had not thought of, he was the anchor.

01:46:42.240 --> 01:46:47.600
And what was interesting is I was with him when the night Obama was elected and I was

01:46:47.600 --> 01:46:54.240
with him the night Trump was elected and on both nights he cried.

01:46:54.240 --> 01:46:59.120
For the same reason, he's like, God, I'm so racist.

01:46:59.120 --> 01:47:06.520
No, I can't remember, but I guess we haven't really addressed Sam's racism.

01:47:06.520 --> 01:47:12.080
Sam seems like mentor, he's a screams mentor, even though he's a close friend of yours so

01:47:12.080 --> 01:47:16.320
you're not going to like label him as a mentor because he's like your buddy, but at the same

01:47:16.320 --> 01:47:20.760
time what you're saying is an anchor, he was there.

01:47:20.760 --> 01:47:26.080
Did that position, did that cause him pain?

01:47:26.080 --> 01:47:28.640
Did he, was he weary of that?

01:47:28.640 --> 01:47:31.640
Did he wish that there was like, yeah, I get it.

01:47:31.640 --> 01:47:35.480
Everyone wants to hear whether or not they need to feel good about themselves.

01:47:35.480 --> 01:47:38.920
Jesus fucking Christ, is anyone going to ask me a goddamn question about what the fuck

01:47:38.920 --> 01:47:39.920
I want?

01:47:39.920 --> 01:47:42.920
Is that me projecting?

01:47:42.920 --> 01:47:46.840
No, he lived in extreme back pain and stuff like that.

01:47:46.840 --> 01:47:58.680
Like I wonder if part of being so empathetic that you take on another, use your microphone.

01:47:58.680 --> 01:47:59.680
Sorry.

01:47:59.680 --> 01:48:01.240
Do you think he embodied?

01:48:01.240 --> 01:48:02.240
I don't know.

01:48:02.240 --> 01:48:07.160
That's something that Bob was very devoted teacher.

01:48:07.160 --> 01:48:12.120
I feel like if you're so good at spotting other people's pain that you have to wear

01:48:12.120 --> 01:48:13.120
that pain.

01:48:13.120 --> 01:48:14.120
No.

01:48:14.120 --> 01:48:16.120
Like you're an antenna for that kind of stuff.

01:48:16.120 --> 01:48:17.120
No.

01:48:17.120 --> 01:48:19.240
I feel like it eased his pain.

01:48:19.240 --> 01:48:22.560
Other people's pain would ease his pain because he would solve it for them.

01:48:22.560 --> 01:48:23.560
He was happy doing that.

01:48:23.560 --> 01:48:24.680
Oh, he loved it.

01:48:24.680 --> 01:48:26.280
He wasn't like invoicing it.

01:48:26.280 --> 01:48:27.280
No.

01:48:27.280 --> 01:48:28.280
Project that under him.

01:48:28.280 --> 01:48:30.080
No, because he's a teacher too.

01:48:30.080 --> 01:48:35.240
It's interesting because years ago there was a televangelist named Teri Cole Whitaker

01:48:35.240 --> 01:48:37.040
who I became friends with.

01:48:37.040 --> 01:48:42.920
And she was very successful and she sold DVDs and books and a book called What You Think

01:48:42.920 --> 01:48:46.960
of Me is None of My Business and all this stuff and everything.

01:48:46.960 --> 01:48:47.960
And finally she quit.

01:48:47.960 --> 01:48:48.960
And I said, I'm quitting.

01:48:48.960 --> 01:48:49.960
And I said, why are you quitting?

01:48:49.960 --> 01:48:53.360
She said, because I feel like I'm everybody's crutch and I don't want to be everybody's

01:48:53.360 --> 01:48:54.360
crutch.

01:48:54.360 --> 01:48:55.360
Okay.

01:48:55.360 --> 01:48:56.360
I want to live my life.

01:48:56.360 --> 01:48:57.360
Sam did not feel like that.

01:48:57.360 --> 01:48:58.360
He didn't feel like that.

01:48:58.360 --> 01:48:59.360
And he wasn't people's crutch.

01:48:59.360 --> 01:49:03.000
He taught people and he had his own private life away from that.

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:08.960
But his relationship with me was not like, you know, I'm your crutch.

01:49:08.960 --> 01:49:09.960
It was like...

01:49:09.960 --> 01:49:10.960
Your friends, dear.

01:49:10.960 --> 01:49:15.680
Your friends, but it was also give and take because I would advise him too.

01:49:15.680 --> 01:49:16.680
Like he...

01:49:16.680 --> 01:49:19.920
Let me throw something around you and see what you think of that.

01:49:19.920 --> 01:49:25.240
You know, because we had interesting perspectives because we knew each other for so long, for

01:49:25.240 --> 01:49:29.360
so many years that we could be objective about each other.

01:49:29.360 --> 01:49:30.360
But I think...

01:49:30.360 --> 01:49:33.320
Well, it's like a favorite thing of his on the off chance that we were to like, oh, we

01:49:33.320 --> 01:49:34.320
got a podcast.

01:49:34.320 --> 01:49:38.920
Like what was a cause of Sam's like as far as charity going one way or another.

01:49:38.920 --> 01:49:41.440
We have a new thing in the podcast where we're like divert things.

01:49:41.440 --> 01:49:46.360
Did Sam have a favorite actual like charity as far as like writing checks or it's like,

01:49:46.360 --> 01:49:49.880
you know what I really love is puppies for poor people or whatever.

01:49:49.880 --> 01:49:50.880
Democrats.

01:49:50.880 --> 01:49:51.880
Well, just straight up.

01:49:51.880 --> 01:49:52.880
Democrats.

01:49:52.880 --> 01:49:53.880
Democrats.

01:49:53.880 --> 01:49:57.880
If you see the Michael Moore documentary though, the recent one, I just told you about

01:49:57.880 --> 01:49:58.880
it.

01:49:58.880 --> 01:49:59.880
Dammit.

01:49:59.880 --> 01:50:00.880
It fucking shook us right into the Bernie camp.

01:50:00.880 --> 01:50:03.720
Like we're like, God damn Obama's a piece of shit.

01:50:03.720 --> 01:50:11.640
Like I did not, I did not expect the Michael Moore documentary to make me go, fuck Democrats.

01:50:11.640 --> 01:50:19.920
It was a really disappointing story and it was a weird like a papamatic bubble of shit

01:50:19.920 --> 01:50:20.920
balls.

01:50:20.920 --> 01:50:22.360
Like this whole thing is fucked.

01:50:22.360 --> 01:50:25.800
I never, I, I, I guess I'm glad for it.

01:50:25.800 --> 01:50:32.680
But anyways, it's, but Sam was like, it's, it's like, like, like he was, he was a died

01:50:32.680 --> 01:50:33.680
in the world.

01:50:33.680 --> 01:50:34.680
Democrat.

01:50:34.680 --> 01:50:38.600
He's like, look, we got to, we got to make this tent and like, like goes straight forward.

01:50:38.600 --> 01:50:39.600
He was a Hillary guy.

01:50:39.600 --> 01:50:44.080
He's, he would have, he would have been a Pelosi guy slash Elizabeth Warren guy, maybe

01:50:44.080 --> 01:50:45.080
or whatever.

01:50:45.080 --> 01:50:46.080
Who knows.

01:50:46.080 --> 01:50:50.880
But, but like, Sam, Sam, Sam couldn't have been more punk rock, but he was like practical.

01:50:50.880 --> 01:50:52.520
He's like, let's fucking win this.

01:50:52.520 --> 01:50:53.520
Stop dicking around.

01:50:53.520 --> 01:50:54.520
Maybe is what he was.

01:50:54.520 --> 01:50:58.920
He's also a huge donor to California hair bears.

01:50:58.920 --> 01:51:08.160
All right, well, look, Sam, I, I feel like I'm suckling pig.

01:51:08.160 --> 01:51:13.080
Like I feel like I got so much of you.

01:51:13.080 --> 01:51:19.440
I just, all I did was come to your, your trough and just like lick and suck and selfishly

01:51:19.440 --> 01:51:20.440
preen.

01:51:20.440 --> 01:51:25.840
Like, I guess this guy tells me this and tells me that and I just, I never anticipated

01:51:25.840 --> 01:51:30.960
that he would be somebody that I, one of my favorite times of my life was when, but you

01:51:30.960 --> 01:51:35.200
know, before you and I were working and we would go to the rest again and we had an hour

01:51:35.200 --> 01:51:41.400
before class and you would go home to your crap apartment in Los Feliz and Dan would

01:51:41.400 --> 01:51:45.040
write me a monologue and then write himself a monologue and I would learn it in the car

01:51:45.040 --> 01:51:47.920
on the way there and we would go in there and do it.

01:51:47.920 --> 01:51:55.400
And Sam kept a lot of the monologues that Dan wrote like right before class and disseminated

01:51:55.400 --> 01:51:59.640
them to like a lot of students and some of the best shit you've ever written was stuff

01:51:59.640 --> 01:52:06.640
that you wrote last second for, to go up there and do, you know, like a minute long monologue.

01:52:06.640 --> 01:52:08.160
Because it was a great writing exercise.

01:52:08.160 --> 01:52:12.520
You go through these classes and you go, oh, this guy's essence is, I'm here to pick your

01:52:12.520 --> 01:52:16.280
pocket and suck your dick or something and you'd be like, well, that's specific.

01:52:16.280 --> 01:52:19.920
And then you're like, okay, what if that guy had to talk for a minute and like, hey, I'm

01:52:19.920 --> 01:52:21.560
here to pick your pocket and suck your dick.

01:52:21.560 --> 01:52:27.160
It was like these essence like writing for you, like writing monologues for you.

01:52:27.160 --> 01:52:34.120
You wrote one for me, it was like a CIA guy that was like jumps from train to train on

01:52:34.120 --> 01:52:38.040
top of it and kills people and just brags about how much he loves being in the CIA and

01:52:38.040 --> 01:52:39.040
killing people.

01:52:39.040 --> 01:52:42.360
And you wrote that in like five minutes and it was fucking amazing.

01:52:42.360 --> 01:52:44.920
Years before Chuck.

01:52:44.920 --> 01:52:51.040
I mean, I was like, amazing.

01:52:51.040 --> 01:52:57.320
I, I, there's a million anecdotes of Sam bringing out people's humanity and bringing

01:52:57.320 --> 01:53:02.200
out their absolute honesty and quality.

01:53:02.200 --> 01:53:06.200
Somebody getting up in class and looking at their cards and people wrote down and the

01:53:06.200 --> 01:53:09.040
guy yelling, I'm not loud.

01:53:09.040 --> 01:53:14.040
Or a woman going, hard to handle, fuck this class and walking outside.

01:53:14.040 --> 01:53:18.760
Like people complaining about their own essence and doing an impression of themselves.

01:53:18.760 --> 01:53:22.800
Like there's, there's no way to replace him.

01:53:22.800 --> 01:53:26.000
He like, I hope we're not boring you to death by a person that you don't know.

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:27.760
Well, what are they going to say to that?

01:53:27.760 --> 01:53:28.760
Yeah, you are.

01:53:28.760 --> 01:53:30.760
They're not, they're good people.

01:53:30.760 --> 01:53:34.560
I was, I was, I was in a long car, car ride with Drew Carey, like, like when I first

01:53:34.560 --> 01:53:38.600
met like very early when I knew him and I was telling him about Sam's class and he was

01:53:38.600 --> 01:53:43.760
driving and he goes, I want to know who I am.

01:53:43.760 --> 01:53:47.560
And he was like on the Drew Carey show, he was like the number one show and he goes,

01:53:47.560 --> 01:53:49.680
I don't really know who I am.

01:53:49.680 --> 01:53:54.040
And he took the class and he came to me and he goes, he goes, he sent everybody he knew

01:53:54.040 --> 01:53:55.640
to the, to Sam's class.

01:53:55.640 --> 01:53:58.400
He goes, we, we think we know who we are.

01:53:58.400 --> 01:54:00.960
There's compliments we wish people would pay us, but they don't.

01:54:00.960 --> 01:54:04.680
And there's insults that we wish people wouldn't pay us, but they do.

01:54:04.680 --> 01:54:06.040
And you have to own all that shit.

01:54:06.040 --> 01:54:10.280
And my favorite essence of Drew's is doing the best I can with what I've got.

01:54:10.280 --> 01:54:15.880
And he goes, and he goes, I'll give you a free car if you want, if you want.

01:54:15.880 --> 01:54:16.880
Yeah.

01:54:16.880 --> 01:54:20.960
And that's why he's brilliant at, on Price is Right, is because like when Drew gives

01:54:20.960 --> 01:54:22.520
you a car, it's like, this is fucking amazing.

01:54:22.520 --> 01:54:26.880
All right, well, we'll get another person who'll come up with this.

01:54:26.880 --> 01:54:27.880
Yeah.

01:54:27.880 --> 01:54:33.080
Shit fire in the wind.

01:54:33.080 --> 01:54:34.080
Fuck me.

01:54:34.080 --> 01:54:35.080
Oh.

01:54:35.080 --> 01:54:36.080
Are you having a stroke?

01:54:36.080 --> 01:54:37.080
What's going on?

01:54:37.080 --> 01:54:38.080
Sam is gone now.

01:54:38.080 --> 01:54:40.080
And so here's, look, here's my thing.

01:54:40.080 --> 01:54:44.160
Young people, because there's not going to be another Sam.

01:54:44.160 --> 01:54:51.280
And as we hear from these Hot Tamale stories, actually, Sam, yeah, if there was another

01:54:51.280 --> 01:54:55.720
Sam, it wouldn't take the same form because tomorrow's Sam, if they were identical the

01:54:55.720 --> 01:55:00.880
last year's Sam would be, what the fuck, that's super racist or whatever.

01:55:00.880 --> 01:55:09.080
Like I would say to young people, like what I learned from this dude that I had thankfully

01:55:09.080 --> 01:55:14.400
intersected with is, is there a way, and like Instagram and Twitter are not going to, they're

01:55:14.400 --> 01:55:17.320
not going to be offering this to you.

01:55:17.320 --> 01:55:25.360
No one is going to tell you that this is important to explore yourself, warts and all, shame and

01:55:25.360 --> 01:55:33.200
all to pour hot, scalding water into yourself and see how low it goes and what pockets it

01:55:33.200 --> 01:55:39.960
fills, like ask yourself these questions, what are you ashamed of?

01:55:39.960 --> 01:55:45.880
What do you think is this thing that you refuse to hear about yourself?

01:55:45.880 --> 01:55:48.440
If somebody says this to you, that's a deal breaker.

01:55:48.440 --> 01:55:49.840
You're going to walk away.

01:55:49.840 --> 01:55:54.000
You're going to, if someone said this to you, you're going to explode because, oh my God,

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:57.160
that's your, holy shit, everyone says that to me.

01:55:57.160 --> 01:56:02.640
Nobody's ever said that to me because I've done such a good job of protecting it.

01:56:02.640 --> 01:56:08.520
You've got this time on earth to like open your own hood and like go into that shit and

01:56:08.520 --> 01:56:10.440
like figure it out.

01:56:10.440 --> 01:56:15.680
The clues that Sam turned us on to were, I don't know if kids these days ever passed

01:56:15.680 --> 01:56:16.680
notes.

01:56:16.680 --> 01:56:20.880
Like now that you guys grew up with cell phones, so why would you ever pass a note?

01:56:20.880 --> 01:56:26.280
I had a box full of letters from girls I had crushes on and vice versa that Sam was able

01:56:26.280 --> 01:56:29.720
to tell me, go on and look at all this and of course I saved all those fucking notes

01:56:29.720 --> 01:56:32.600
from Gina and I was able to go, holy shit.

01:56:32.600 --> 01:56:38.160
She's calling me capricious and aloof and interesting and organic and then it's like

01:56:38.160 --> 01:56:44.480
slob, weird, lazy fucking nerd like like like and noticing like what happens when people

01:56:44.480 --> 01:56:46.720
fall in and out of love with you.

01:56:46.720 --> 01:56:47.720
But you have your texts.

01:56:47.720 --> 01:56:49.760
You can go back through them.

01:56:49.760 --> 01:56:51.600
Like what do what do people say about you?

01:56:51.600 --> 01:56:54.920
It's easier than you can like search for keywords and stuff.

01:56:54.920 --> 01:56:57.240
What do people say about you when they're excited about you?

01:56:57.240 --> 01:57:01.640
What do people say about you when they, when they're your biggest fan?

01:57:01.640 --> 01:57:04.920
What do people say about you when they want to really hurt you?

01:57:04.920 --> 01:57:07.720
What's the worst thing that someone could say about you?

01:57:07.720 --> 01:57:10.800
Shit on a scarf and then return it.

01:57:10.800 --> 01:57:17.040
Sam, Sam, Sam, I think if you were here would say start there, start coming up with adjectives

01:57:17.040 --> 01:57:22.860
for this stuff, then get out of thesaurus and look up the synonyms for those adjectives.

01:57:22.860 --> 01:57:27.760
Make big lists of the things that people have said about you and then look up the synonyms

01:57:27.760 --> 01:57:34.640
for those things and find words that spike your rage, your shame, your silence, your

01:57:34.640 --> 01:57:39.000
emotions and start asking yourself what if I had permission to be these things?

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:42.400
What if these things were the only point of me being around?

01:57:42.400 --> 01:57:45.280
That might be a really good direction to go as a writer.

01:57:45.280 --> 01:57:50.640
I mean so many of our listeners like I think a disproportionate amount of our listeners

01:57:50.640 --> 01:57:56.560
are aspiring writers because I've snowed them into thinking I'm a writer.

01:57:56.560 --> 01:57:57.560
Why am I self deprecating?

01:57:57.560 --> 01:57:58.560
I'm an amazing writer.

01:57:58.560 --> 01:57:59.560
I'm so drunk.

01:57:59.560 --> 01:58:00.560
I'm sorry.

01:58:00.560 --> 01:58:04.440
One of my essences ends the show badly.

01:58:04.440 --> 01:58:07.960
Sam is gone, there's no more of the class.

01:58:07.960 --> 01:58:12.320
We know a lot of people that have passed away but how many people do we eulogize this much

01:58:12.320 --> 01:58:13.680
and why are we doing it?

01:58:13.680 --> 01:58:20.320
And I think like and I don't want to make myself cry because I'm a crier but he was

01:58:20.320 --> 01:58:24.200
a healer and how many people can you say that about?

01:58:24.200 --> 01:58:28.920
Well because if it was a Western it would be like well I get seven bullet holes on

01:58:28.920 --> 01:58:36.640
the back of my jacket and they all represent seven times that Sam saved my life.

01:58:36.640 --> 01:58:39.160
I wouldn't be here.

01:58:39.160 --> 01:58:43.080
It's unfair that he's gone and we're here.

01:58:43.080 --> 01:58:48.880
That's why I'm like scrambling to like what are we supposed to do?

01:58:48.880 --> 01:58:50.880
What 40 are we supposed to pull?

01:58:50.880 --> 01:58:59.800
When I got the call my first thought was I cannot imagine Sam not being on this planet.

01:58:59.800 --> 01:59:00.800
That was my feeling.

01:59:00.800 --> 01:59:01.800
Never thought about it.

01:59:01.800 --> 01:59:03.240
And never thought about it.

01:59:03.240 --> 01:59:08.560
It was never something we even talked about, about that even being a possibility.

01:59:08.560 --> 01:59:12.640
And he came to my workshop, I teach singing workshops, and he came to my workshop one

01:59:12.640 --> 01:59:13.640
night.

01:59:13.640 --> 01:59:18.560
He said I really want to be a part of that and see what you do.

01:59:18.560 --> 01:59:23.760
And the next Friday night when we got together he said it's so interesting to me that without

01:59:23.760 --> 01:59:29.480
us ever talking about it that what you're giving these people is very similar to what

01:59:29.480 --> 01:59:30.480
I do.

01:59:30.480 --> 01:59:34.880
So that if somebody came in and said I want to play Eliza Doolittle in My Fair Lady and

01:59:34.880 --> 01:59:40.040
I would say do you really feel a connection with that character?

01:59:40.040 --> 01:59:45.160
No, I just like those songs.

01:59:45.160 --> 01:59:46.920
That's not it.

01:59:46.920 --> 01:59:51.040
You have to find out how the world sees you.

01:59:51.040 --> 01:59:53.200
That will tell you how you're castable.

01:59:53.200 --> 01:59:58.720
And that will help you maneuver through life so that people are receptive to you.

01:59:58.720 --> 02:00:06.720
And you know, he moved me every week of my life and I just, I cannot, I haven't yet been

02:00:06.720 --> 02:00:13.000
able to wrap my head around the loss of this man who was so dear.

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:21.080
And on Wednesday I have to sing at his funeral and I mean it's going to be very difficult.

02:00:21.080 --> 02:00:26.160
To Friday nights is, you know, it's Sam.

02:00:26.160 --> 02:00:33.520
But how lucky we all are and blessed is what I feel at the end of the day to have had this

02:00:33.520 --> 02:00:37.600
man touch our lives in the way he did.

02:00:37.600 --> 02:00:42.560
And do you guys know about his buried gold?

02:00:42.560 --> 02:00:43.560
His Nazi gold.

02:00:43.560 --> 02:00:45.560
Oh, his Nazi gold?

02:00:45.560 --> 02:00:46.560
Yeah.

02:00:46.560 --> 02:00:49.160
Well, why bury it then?

02:00:49.160 --> 02:00:53.000
Why not just let it be Nazi gold and...

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:54.600
If I had Nazi gold, I wouldn't bury it.

02:00:54.600 --> 02:00:58.920
I'd be like, well, it's Nazi gold, take it at your peril.

02:00:58.920 --> 02:01:00.400
You got to bury your Nazi gold.

02:01:00.400 --> 02:01:01.400
All right.

02:01:01.400 --> 02:01:02.400
Well, I guess...

02:01:02.400 --> 02:01:03.960
You're going to leave your Nazi gold just hanging around?

02:01:03.960 --> 02:01:04.960
What were you going to say?

02:01:04.960 --> 02:01:05.960
Nothing.

02:01:05.960 --> 02:01:15.240
I was going to agree with him saying that it's lucky to have met him and maybe nobody

02:01:15.240 --> 02:01:20.080
in our live audience, but lots of people that are listening to us have met him or got to

02:01:20.080 --> 02:01:21.360
meet him.

02:01:21.360 --> 02:01:29.560
But really he's the reason why I am where I am and he brought a lot of people together.

02:01:29.560 --> 02:01:35.480
And he was a real artist just by sitting in a chair and asking simple questions and letting

02:01:35.480 --> 02:01:37.880
you be you.

02:01:37.880 --> 02:01:39.640
It's pretty crazy.

02:01:39.640 --> 02:01:43.680
He would listen to you do the shittiest monologue of the world thinking come in and go like,

02:01:43.680 --> 02:01:44.680
here's the thing.

02:01:44.680 --> 02:01:45.680
Whoa, it's me.

02:01:45.680 --> 02:01:48.160
Hey, I'm Johnny Greaseball.

02:01:48.160 --> 02:01:54.960
And he would just take it all in and go, why did you pick this piece?

02:01:54.960 --> 02:01:56.960
I like Johnny Greaseball.

02:01:56.960 --> 02:01:59.000
It's my favorite movie.

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:01.760
What's Johnny Greaseball doing in this monologue?

02:02:01.760 --> 02:02:06.400
Well, he's being kind of a shithead, but don't judge him.

02:02:06.400 --> 02:02:07.400
Don't judge him.

02:02:07.400 --> 02:02:09.440
That was a big thing I learned from Sam as a writer.

02:02:09.440 --> 02:02:11.120
Don't judge that fucking character.

02:02:11.120 --> 02:02:14.600
When I was doing community, it was like, no, no, no, no, no.

02:02:14.600 --> 02:02:17.720
Never judge the character.

02:02:17.720 --> 02:02:21.760
How dare you assume that your character's being a piece of shit?

02:02:21.760 --> 02:02:25.200
No, the character is trying to accomplish something.

02:02:25.200 --> 02:02:26.400
He's Johnny Greaseball.

02:02:26.400 --> 02:02:27.400
What's he trying to do?

02:02:27.400 --> 02:02:29.240
He's trying to convince.

02:02:29.240 --> 02:02:33.440
Guys, have you ever tried to convince somebody of something?

02:02:33.440 --> 02:02:40.040
Yeah, I suppose, like, think about, what have you ever tried to convince somebody of?

02:02:40.040 --> 02:02:41.520
Think about something, just anything.

02:02:41.520 --> 02:02:44.480
Oh, my mom, I had to get her to co-sign a car.

02:02:44.480 --> 02:02:50.240
I bought, like, you had to get your mom to co-sign a car loan.

02:02:50.240 --> 02:02:52.360
How old were you?

02:02:52.360 --> 02:02:53.360
22.

02:02:53.360 --> 02:02:55.360
Where were you?

02:02:55.360 --> 02:02:58.360
I had to go to her kitchenette.

02:02:58.360 --> 02:02:59.360
What was the wallpaper?

02:02:59.360 --> 02:03:00.360
What did it look like?

02:03:00.360 --> 02:03:01.360
It was yellow.

02:03:01.360 --> 02:03:02.360
Go.

02:03:02.360 --> 02:03:05.440
He would just, you never knew when he was going to do that.

02:03:05.440 --> 02:03:06.440
Go.

02:03:06.440 --> 02:03:11.480
And you had the monologue memorized, and you had memorized it as an actor, like, you're

02:03:11.480 --> 02:03:14.960
like, woo, hey, I'm Johnny Greaseball, and he's like, why are you always on it?

02:03:14.960 --> 02:03:15.960
And then you go, go.

02:03:15.960 --> 02:03:18.760
And you're thinking about your mom's wallpaper and trying to convince your mom.

02:03:18.760 --> 02:03:25.000
And you're like, you would just be like, I'm Johnny Greaseball.

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:27.640
Do you want to buy a bowling ball?

02:03:27.640 --> 02:03:33.960
And almost invariably, sometimes twice, sometimes he'd do it three times.

02:03:33.960 --> 02:03:38.640
Every once in a while, you'd get the sense of like, yeah, this person needs another.

02:03:38.640 --> 02:03:39.960
They need to mold us over.

02:03:39.960 --> 02:03:44.720
But most of the time, it was like watching a chiropractor on a caveman.

02:03:44.720 --> 02:03:50.760
Just go, crack, like, where you came in one way, and he just would go, broop.

02:03:50.760 --> 02:03:51.760
You memorized this model.

02:03:51.760 --> 02:03:52.760
Like, there you go.

02:03:52.760 --> 02:03:53.760
Do this.

02:03:53.760 --> 02:03:54.960
And then you would do it completely differently.

02:03:54.960 --> 02:04:00.720
And the room would be silent because you had nailed the Johnny Greaseball monologue.

02:04:00.720 --> 02:04:04.720
Actor or not, good actor, bad actor, who gives a shit?

02:04:04.720 --> 02:04:08.400
You were sitting in a chair, and he was like, you memorized it.

02:04:08.400 --> 02:04:14.200
Now, say it like you're trying to convince somebody, if that's what the intention is.

02:04:14.200 --> 02:04:17.440
And he was like, you would walk out of there going, holy shit.

02:04:17.440 --> 02:04:21.360
He told a great story about Robert DeVall, who he worked on Network with.

02:04:21.360 --> 02:04:27.280
And I did one of Robert DeVall's monologues from that, where he's firing William Holden.

02:04:27.280 --> 02:04:30.480
And I did it again a couple of times, and it went okay.

02:04:30.480 --> 02:04:33.640
And I said, when Robert DeVall did that, like, how many takes was that?

02:04:33.640 --> 02:04:34.640
Was that like take 10?

02:04:34.640 --> 02:04:36.640
And he goes, he did it once.

02:04:36.640 --> 02:04:39.920
And he's like, that's how good Robert DeVall was.

02:04:39.920 --> 02:04:42.920
And when he did the, what was the profit?

02:04:42.920 --> 02:04:44.520
What was that one called?

02:04:44.520 --> 02:04:47.520
Where he was, fuck, okay.

02:04:47.520 --> 02:04:50.360
The apostle, thank you.

02:04:50.360 --> 02:04:53.640
He asked him in an interview, how do you prepare for that?

02:04:53.640 --> 02:04:57.400
And he goes, I'm so good at this now, I've been doing it for so long, I don't really

02:04:57.400 --> 02:04:58.400
have to prepare.

02:04:58.400 --> 02:04:59.400
I just learned the lines.

02:04:59.400 --> 02:05:03.280
And I think of one thing, and this is a great thing that Sam told me, because I overcomplicate

02:05:03.280 --> 02:05:04.280
things.

02:05:04.280 --> 02:05:08.480
He said, I walk on the set, and I just look, I just find something.

02:05:08.480 --> 02:05:11.640
And when I did that monologue, I looked up and I said, wow, there's a lot of lights up

02:05:11.640 --> 02:05:12.640
there.

02:05:12.640 --> 02:05:16.080
It sounds like cheating, you're an actor.

02:05:16.080 --> 02:05:19.560
And then he goes, just one thing that makes you feel like a human being.

02:05:19.560 --> 02:05:22.240
Like one thing that puts you in the present moment.

02:05:22.240 --> 02:05:26.400
Not your preparation or anything, it's, oh, geez, look at all these lights.

02:05:26.400 --> 02:05:28.600
And then he goes, he goes, I know the shit's there.

02:05:28.600 --> 02:05:33.000
And that's what Sam taught me, is like, you have all of the emotions right there.

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:34.280
Like just let them happen.

02:05:34.280 --> 02:05:35.280
You can do that.

02:05:35.280 --> 02:05:36.760
And don't overthink things.

02:05:36.760 --> 02:05:38.320
Anyway, we love you, Sam.

02:05:38.320 --> 02:05:40.480
Schrab, you've been awful quiet.

02:05:40.480 --> 02:05:41.480
Yeah.

02:05:41.480 --> 02:05:43.800
Oh, Jesus, it's 10, 10.

02:05:43.800 --> 02:05:44.800
I know.

02:05:44.800 --> 02:05:45.800
We've gone over.

02:05:45.800 --> 02:05:46.800
Fuck.

02:05:46.800 --> 02:05:49.440
I mean, Sam would not want to be remembered for that extra long podcast.

02:05:49.440 --> 02:05:52.040
Do you want to put a little punctuation on this, Schrab?

02:05:52.040 --> 02:05:54.440
If I can earn your keep.

02:05:54.440 --> 02:05:56.440
Earn my keep.

02:05:56.440 --> 02:06:04.280
No, I mean, I've been quiet a long because, I mean, Sam does mean like so much to me.

02:06:04.280 --> 02:06:05.280
Prove it.

02:06:05.280 --> 02:06:12.080
And it's hard to not talk about him without getting choked up.

02:06:12.080 --> 02:06:15.960
So that's why I've been quiet.

02:06:15.960 --> 02:06:26.520
And no, Sam taught me a lot about just believing in myself and who I was and just being happy

02:06:26.520 --> 02:06:30.200
in my own skin.

02:06:30.200 --> 02:06:31.200
And that's it.

02:06:31.200 --> 02:06:33.200
Well, let's take that moment to silence.

02:06:33.200 --> 02:06:34.200
I'm sorry.

02:06:34.200 --> 02:06:35.200
I'm breaking up.

02:06:35.200 --> 02:06:36.200
We love you, Sam.

02:06:36.200 --> 02:06:37.200
Goodbye, Sam.

02:06:37.200 --> 02:06:38.200
That's been Harmontown.

02:06:38.200 --> 02:06:39.200
Thank you so much, you guys.

02:06:39.200 --> 02:06:40.200
Cody and Randy Heller.

02:06:40.200 --> 02:06:49.600
Bob Garrett, thank you so much for being with us.

02:06:49.600 --> 02:06:51.960
Rob Schrab, everybody.

02:06:51.960 --> 02:06:54.760
I'm Jeff Davis, your crying comptroller.

02:06:54.760 --> 02:06:55.920
Dan Harmon's been your mayor.

02:06:55.920 --> 02:06:56.920
Thank you all so much for coming.

02:06:56.920 --> 02:06:57.920
We love you.

02:06:57.920 --> 02:07:01.920
And it's Church Road from Nick Cave.

02:07:01.920 --> 02:07:03.920
Embrace your floods.

02:07:03.920 --> 02:07:06.440
They're the only thing of interest that you have.

02:07:06.440 --> 02:07:13.440
They're my fast-to-take chances on.

02:07:13.440 --> 02:07:32.440
Did you get any of that?

02:07:32.440 --> 02:07:39.440
Well, I'll see you in the next video.

02:07:39.440 --> 02:07:40.440
Bye.

02:07:40.440 --> 02:07:41.440
Bye.

02:07:41.440 --> 02:07:42.440
Bye.

02:07:42.440 --> 02:07:43.440
Bye.

02:07:43.440 --> 02:07:44.440
Bye.
