need to give me the candelabra, okay, okay, can you hold?\n\n04:36.120 --> 04:37.120\nNo problem.\n\n04:37.120 --> 04:38.120\nSir?\n\n04:38.120 --> 04:40.040\nYeah, are you talking to my burglar right

I'm calling it on a radio show.\n\n04:57.360 --> 05:00.640\nThat was always the thing, millennials probably don't know about that, because it was like,\n\n05:00.640 --> 05:06.120\nthe radio, all like local radio, they're like, all right, it's about five o'clock, we're\n\n05:06.120 --> 05:09.360\nplaying all the hits of the alchemy that's coming up, what do you want?\n\n05:09.360 --> 05:13.440\nAnd

it's exciting to be on the radio, but if it's\n\n05:20.160 --> 05:24.920\non, well, you're on the phone, then the radio's gonna go into this microphone or the phone\n\n05:24.920 --> 05:28.120\nand then we're gonna be listening to you, listening to you.\n\n05:28.120 --> 05:33.880\nIt's a tough thing to, it's kind of a Christopher Nolan thing, but you gotta fucking figure\n\n05:33.880 --> 05:39.800\nit out, be a professional, mute that radio, talk to us as if we're no big deal and then\n\n05:39.800 --> 05:42.440\nyou'll sound good for everybody else.\n\n05:42.440 --> 05:44.680\nThis guy's burglarizing my home right now.\n\n05:44.680 --> 05:47.640\nSir, I need you to calm down.\n\n05:47.640 --> 05:55.080\nI'm fucking, you seem more stressed out than I am, I'm in my closet hiding, I have a weapon.\n\n05:55.080 --> 06:03.000\nIf you listen to True Crime Podcast for a year, I now feel like if something happens\n\n06:03.000 --> 06:09.800\nto me, if I come home and Cody has lost an arm, I'm gonna try to figure out, I'm gonna\n\n06:09.800 --> 06:17.840\nGoogle what to do if you lose an arm before calling 911 because I don't wanna end up having\n\n06:17.840 --> 06:24.520\nthe recording of me pondered over, but I feel like, oh, he doesn't sound very upset.\n\n06:24.520 --> 06:31.760\nI think he cut off her arm, but if you call them and go like, oh my god, oh my god, my\n\n06:31.760 --> 06:38.040\ngirlfriend's arm got cut off, they're like, sir, sir, sir, calm down.\n\n06:38.040 --> 06:40.040\nWhat's your address?\n\n06:40.040 --> 06:46.960\nOh my god, it's one, two, three, four on the fiction street, I don't know, sir, sir.\n\n06:46.960 --> 06:49.680\nWhy are you still chastising me?\n\n06:49.680 --> 06:53.520\nAfter the point where you get the address and your ambulance is on the way, can I have\n\n06:53.520 --> 07:01.000\npermission to freak out about the dead body I found and or do I have your permission to\n\n07:01.000 --> 07:05.720\nbe enough on the spectrum that the one thing I'm good at is calling 911?\n\n07:05.720 --> 07:11.840\nI'm so sick of this fucking, oh, he's like, listen to this 911 call, and it just seems\n\n07:11.840 --> 07:20.840\na little weird, hello, 911, yeah, my children are missing, your children are missing, yeah,\n\n07:20.840 --> 07:26.120\nthey're missing and it's noon now and I haven't seen them since 1130

do something wrong.\n\n07:39.160 --> 07:42.760\nDan, who have you killed?\n\n07:42.760 --> 07:49.960\nI'm never going to kill anybody, but yes, you are and you're, it's only a matter of\n\n07:49.960 --> 07:55.880\ntime before we're all adjacent to a murder, God forbid, I just don't think it's fair that\n\n07:55.880 --> 08:01.040\npeople like analyze how you respond to a trauma, right, I also like, here's the thing, we're\n\n08:01.040 --> 08:06.000\ngoing to have our, look, if you're a big fan of our podcast and you just want, I'm not\n\n08:06.000 --> 08:10.560\nlike an Oprah or like

happening?\n\n08:41.440 --> 08:44.480\nHow long have I been gone?\n\n08:44.480 --> 08:54.600\nYour beard is gray and long, Jeff, you seem so much further away than usual.\n\n08:54.600 --> 09:07.040\nOne thing that I like about their podcast, the red-handed podcast, which is a true crime\n\n09:07.040 --> 09:08.040\npodcast.\n\n09:08.040 --> 09:09.040\nThe red-handed...\n\n09:09.040 -->

he's, all right, anyways, the thing I like\n\n09:44.680 --> 09:48.400\nabout, one of the many things I like about their podcast is that every single time a\n\n09:48.400 --> 09:54.040\nlie detector comes up, it's time to like open, like we have to revolt against this\n\n09:54.040 --> 09:57.360\nkind, lie detectors are bullshit, it's bullshit.\n\n09:57.360 --> 09:58.360\nWho did you

die,\n\n10:06.800 --> 10:14.640\nI will be somehow misconstrued and judged because of my affect, and whether it's like\n\n10:14.640 --> 10:22.440\nI fail a polygraph test or I refuse to take one, which is like, oh, that's weird, he refused\n\n10:22.440 --> 10:28.280\nto take a polygraph test, everyone please refuse to take every polygraph test, they\n\n10:28.280 --> 10:29.280\nmean

cement this.\n\n13:45.000 --> 13:46.000\nI've mentioned it before.\n\n13:46.000 --> 13:49.320\nIt's been a theory, but I want to make it a technical fact.\n\n13:49.320 --> 13:56.320\nAs of your daughter proposing to me, I am now officially and technically a Karate Kid in\n\n13:56.320 --> 13:57.320\nlaw.\n\n13:57.320 --> 13:58.320\nThat's right.\n\n13:58.320 --> 14:01.720\nIn every way that

right?\n\n14:06.720 --> 14:07.720\nI'm very.\n\n14:07.720 --> 14:09.760\nBecause you know that I love you.\n\n14:09.760 --> 14:10.760\nYou know that.\n\n14:10.760 --> 14:11.760\nWe've determined that.\n\n14:11.760 --> 14:12.760\nNot at first.\n\n14:12.760 --> 14:13.760\nNo.\n\n14:13.760 --> 14:14.760\nNot so much.\n\n14:14.760 --> 14:15.760\nIt wasn't.\n\n14:15.760 --> 14:17.040\nIt wasn't love at first sight.\n\n14:17.040 --> 14:18.600\nBut he's grown on me.\n\n14:18.600 --> 14:19.840\nLike a fungus.\n\n14:19.840 --> 14:26.480\nA lot of me joining your family is learning what love really is.\n\n14:26.480 --> 14:32.160\nI mean, my relationship with Cody, I'm like, oh, that's what love, oh, shit.\n\n14:32.160 --> 14:35.320\nThere's no knocking on any previous relationship I've ever had.\n\n14:35.320 --> 14:38.480\nI just sort of like, and then I join your family.\n\n14:38.480 --> 14:40.120\nYou guys really love each other.\n\n14:40.120 --> 14:47.160\nIt's really, it can be alienating and dizzying to an astronaut from the vacuum of.\n\n14:47.160 --> 14:48.320\nI can understand that.\n\n14:48.320 --> 14:49.320\nYeah.\n\n14:49.320 --> 14:50.320\nYeah.\n\n14:50.320 --> 14:51.320\nI have a lot of us.\n\n14:51.320 --> 14:52.320\nBut don't count yourself in you just yet.\n\n14:52.320 --> 14:53.320\nNo, no, no.\n\n14:53.320 --> 14:54.320\nI won't.\n\n14:54.320 --> 14:55.760\nI just want to, you know, step by step.\n\n14:55.760 --> 14:56.760\nYeah.\n\n14:56.760 --> 14:57.760\nThat makes me comfortable.\n\n14:57.760 --> 15:01.120\nI like knowing that there's like airlocks and like conditions.\n\n15:01.120 --> 15:03.000\nThat makes me comfortable.\n\n15:03.000 --> 15:09.200\nLike for instance, like I remember distinctly, very shortly into me dating Cody, which was\n\n15:09.200 --> 15:12.160\na pretty intense rebound.\n\n15:12.160 --> 15:17.600\nI can say that now that it's like permanent, but I mean, there was no indications.\n\n15:17.600 --> 15:25.480\nI was like, I was dating Cody very quickly after the divorce of my last relationship,\n\n15:25.480 --> 15:27.080\nwhich made both of us ponder things.\n\n15:27.080 --> 15:29.280\nAnyway, put a pin in my view on this.\n\n15:29.280 --> 15:32.480\nThis is about you.\n\n15:32.480 --> 15:35.800\nYou had this apartment in New York or you were staying at Cody's apartment in New York.\n\n15:35.800 --> 15:36.800\nYes.\n\n15:36.800 --> 15:42.240\nAnd I went to visit her on her first show because she did this show called Dead Beat for three\n\n15:42.240 --> 15:43.240\nseasons.\n\n15:43.240 --> 15:44.240\nRight.\n\n15:44.240 --> 15:45.240\nAnd I went to visit her.\n\n15:45.240 --> 15:46.240\nOkay.\n\n15:46.240 --> 15:47.240\nGood.\n\n15:47.240 --> 15:48.240\nGood.\n\n15:48.240 --> 15:49.240\nIt's Cody.\n\n15:49.240 --> 15:50.240\nCody.\n\n15:50.240 --> 15:51.240\nCome out here.\n\n15:51.240 --> 15:52.240\nNot now, Cody.\n\n15:52.240 --> 15:53.240\nCome out, Cody.\n\n15:53.240 --> 15:54.240\nNo, she doesn't have to.\n\n15:54.240 --> 15:55.240\nCome on.\n\n15:55.240 --> 15:56.240\nYeah.\n\n15:56.240 --> 15:57.240\nYeah.\n\n15:57.240 --> 15:58.240\nYeah.\n\n15:58.240 --> 15:59.240\nYeah.\n\n15:59.240 --> 16:00.240\nYeah.\n\n16:00.240 --> 16:07.480\nI'm totally in love with this child because grab a seat and grab a mic.\n\n16:07.480 --> 16:11.240\nSo she got this show and she's on this show.\n\n16:11.240 --> 16:12.240\nEat that mic.\n\n16:12.240 --> 16:13.240\nHuh?\n\n16:13.240 --> 16:14.240\nEat the mic.\n\n16:14.240 --> 16:15.240\nEat it.\n\n16:15.240 --> 16:16.240\nEat it.\n\n16:16.240 --> 16:17.240\nOkay.\n\n16:17.240 --> 16:20.680\nSo she gets the show and I'm like thrilled.\n\n16:20.680 --> 16:22.880\nMy kid has her own show.\n\n16:22.880 --> 16:27.360\nAnd so I went to New York to visit her and it's cold in New York.\n\n16:27.360 --> 16:33.840\nSo I bought a lot of stuff to warm myself because it's freezing, a hat, gloves, coat.\n\n16:33.840 --> 16:34.840\nOkay.\n\n16:34.840 --> 16:36.320\nBut first, hold on.\n\n16:36.320 --> 16:37.320\nOkay.\n\n16:37.320 --> 16:38.320\nAll right.\n\n16:38.320 --> 16:40.120\nSee what it's like to be...\n\n16:40.120 --> 16:41.760\nBut you brought her out.\n\n16:41.760 --> 16:42.760\nI know.\n\n16:42.760 --> 16:43.760\nYou brought me out.\n\n16:43.760 --> 16:47.280\nSo if this gets frustrating, yeah.\n\n16:47.280 --> 16:48.520\nSo should I continue the story?\n\n16:48.520 --> 16:49.520\nYeah.\n\n16:49.520 --> 16:50.520\nAll right.\n\n16:50.520 --> 16:53.280\nSo I bought this huge scarf to keep me warm.\n\n16:53.280 --> 16:54.280\nOh, geez.\n\n16:54.280 --> 16:55.280\nOkay.\n\n16:55.280 --> 16:56.280\nHere it is.\n\n16:56.280 --> 16:57.280\nI brought you up for the scarf story.\n\n16:57.280 --> 16:58.280\nYeah.\n\n16:58.280 --> 16:59.280\nIt's a scarf story.\n\n16:59.280 --> 17:00.280\nAll right.\n\n17:00.280 --> 17:06.760\nSo I bought this enormous long white and black scarf to keep my neck warm.\n\n17:06.760 --> 17:08.600\nAnd it was not that cute.\n\n17:08.600 --> 17:13.560\nLike you tried it on and we looked at it and we both agreed it wasn't that cute.\n\n17:13.560 --> 17:15.560\nOr I at least...\n\n17:15.560 --> 17:16.560\nOkay.\n\n17:16.560 --> 17:17.560\nI at least thought that.\n\n17:17.560 --> 17:18.560\nReally?\n\n17:18.560 --> 17:19.560\nThere was contention about the scarf.\n\n17:19.560 --> 17:20.560\nOh.\n\n17:20.560 --> 17:21.560\nSo there was initial contention?\n\n17:21.560 --> 17:22.560\nI...\n\n17:22.560 --> 17:23.560\nOkay.\n\n17:23.560 --> 17:24.560\nYou tell your version of it.\n\n17:24.560 --> 17:25.560\nYou shouldn't have brought me out here.\n\n17:25.560 --> 17:26.560\nYes.\n\n17:26.560 --> 17:27.560\nI'm not going to talk anymore.\n\n17:27.560 --> 17:28.560\nJust tell the scarf story.\n\n17:28.560 --> 17:29.560\nAll right.\n\n17:29.560 --> 17:33.920\nSo I got all dressed up and I'm supposed to meet her for lunch or breakfast, whatever\n\n17:33.920 --> 17:34.920\nit was.\n\n17:34.920 --> 17:39.280\nSo I put everything on knowing that I'm going to go out and like really freezing temperature.\n\n17:39.280 --> 17:40.280\nBig long scarf.\n\n17:40.280 --> 17:41.280\nNow when?\n\n17:41.280 --> 17:43.880\nBig long fucking scarf.\n\n17:43.880 --> 17:45.160\nSo I...\n\n17:45.160 --> 17:50.440\nYou know when you go on vacation, you're kind of off your routine, like going to the bathroom\n\n17:50.440 --> 17:53.040\nin the morning, you know, like at home, eight o'clock.\n\n17:53.040 --> 17:55.160\nYou're talking about constipation irregularity.\n\n17:55.160 --> 17:56.160\nYeah.\n\n17:56.160 --> 17:57.160\nRight.\n\n17:57.160 --> 18:02.000\nIt's like vacation altered poop, you know.\n\n18:02.000 --> 18:03.880\nSo a VAP, we call it in my family.\n\n18:03.880 --> 18:08.360\nWe have a thing called VAPs, which was supposed to be an acronym, but it actually isn't because\n\n18:08.360 --> 18:10.360\nvacation induced...\n\n18:10.360 --> 18:11.360\nNo.\n\n18:11.360 --> 18:12.360\nWhat is it?\n\n18:12.360 --> 18:13.360\nI think it's altered poop.\n\n18:13.360 --> 18:14.360\nNo, that's not it.\n\n18:14.360 --> 18:18.120\nSo in other words, instead of going to the bathroom at eight o'clock, when you're on vacation,\n\n18:18.120 --> 18:19.120\nyou're off.\n\n18:19.120 --> 18:20.360\nYou're off your routine.\n\n18:20.360 --> 18:23.720\nSo I got all dressed up and I didn't go to the bathroom.\n\n18:23.720 --> 18:24.720\nNobody.\n\n18:24.720 --> 18:25.720\nNobody.\n\n18:25.720 --> 18:29.560\nWhen you're regular, you don't go, it's eight o'clock, this is when I poop, like that's\n\n18:29.560 --> 18:30.560\nnot...\n\n18:30.560 --> 18:35.360\nNo, like every morning at about eight o'clock, I have to take a dump.\n\n18:35.360 --> 18:36.360\nOkay.\n\n18:36.360 --> 18:37.360\nAll right.\n\n18:37.360 --> 18:38.360\nAll right.\n\n18:38.360 --> 18:39.360\nWhat's wrong with that?\n\n18:39.360 --> 18:40.360\nNo, that's why I've always felt...\n\n18:40.360 --> 18:43.320\nThat's why I always feel like I'm constipated, because you've made it seem to be like it\n\n18:43.320 --> 18:46.440\nwas going to be this thing that happened every day to give in time, and it's not for me at\n\n18:46.440 --> 18:47.440\nall.\n\n18:47.440 --> 18:48.440\nOkay.\n\n18:48.440 --> 18:51.240\nI'm just saying, like I think that's part of why I always get constipated, it's like\n\n18:51.240 --> 18:54.920\nI put this pressure on myself, I'm like, oh, it's not...\n\n18:54.920 --> 18:58.680\nIt's a parenting fail, like you should have done better or something happened there, you\n\n18:58.680 --> 18:59.680\nknow what I'm saying?\n\n18:59.680 --> 19:00.680\nI feel so bad now.\n\n19:00.680 --> 19:01.880\nI feel so guilty.\n\n19:01.880 --> 19:05.840\nSomething happened with my butthole that I have stuff going on with that, you know?\n\n19:05.840 --> 19:09.000\nI got my first hemorrhoid, I told you, I sent you a picture.\n\n19:09.000 --> 19:10.000\nI sent you a picture.\n\n19:10.000 --> 19:15.840\nRemember, I sent you a picture of a first hemorrhoid to her and then my sister, because\n\n19:15.840 --> 19:17.880\nwell, I wanted to know for sure what it was.\n\n19:17.880 --> 19:19.920\nYou sent your mother a picture of your hemorrhoid?\n\n19:19.920 --> 19:21.920\nYeah, and then Dan saw it too.\n\n19:21.920 --> 19:25.240\nYeah, on accident, slowly.\n\n19:25.240 --> 19:26.240\nYou liked it.\n\n19:26.240 --> 19:27.240\nAll right.\n\n19:27.240 --> 19:28.240\nSo, like...\n\n19:28.240 --> 19:29.240\nYou still liked it, though.\n\n19:29.240 --> 19:30.240\nI'm not going to get the story out.\n\n19:30.240 --> 19:33.240\nI'm fine with the seat room, but I want to keep the train on rails.\n\n19:33.240 --> 19:38.640\nTo be fair, guys, we warned you, this is going to be an emotionally intense episode.\n\n19:38.640 --> 19:39.640\nHold on.\n\n19:39.640 --> 19:40.640\nSo, you...\n\n19:40.640 --> 19:41.640\nRight?\n\n19:41.640 --> 19:42.640\nGoose?\n\n19:42.640 --> 19:43.640\nYeah.\n\n19:43.640 --> 19:44.640\nUh-oh.\n\n19:44.640 --> 19:45.640\nAll right.\n\n19:45.640 --> 19:46.640\nWell...\n\n19:46.640 --> 19:47.640\nMom, finish the story.\n\n19:47.640 --> 19:48.640\nI need help.\n\n19:48.640 --> 19:49.640\nI need some help.\n\n19:49.640 --> 19:50.640\nCan we back up?\n\n19:50.640 --> 19:51.640\nCan we...\n\n19:51.640 --> 19:52.640\nYeah.\n\n19:52.640 --> 19:53.640\nYeah.\n\n19:53.640 --> 19:56.240\nI think you guys should go out and come back on again.\n\n19:56.240 --> 20:00.520\nThe way that she's told, whatever she just told about that, we can not talk about that\n\n20:00.520 --> 20:01.520\nfor a second.\n\n20:01.520 --> 20:04.040\nGo back to what you were talking about was like the first time that you guys met.\n\n20:04.040 --> 20:05.040\nNo, that doesn't matter.\n\n20:05.040 --> 20:06.040\nWe've accelerated.\n\n20:06.040 --> 20:07.360\nLike, she's halfway through the scarf story.\n\n20:07.360 --> 20:08.360\nI want...\n\n20:08.360 --> 20:09.360\nI'm fine.\n\n20:09.360 --> 20:10.360\nWe're going back.\n\n20:10.360 --> 20:11.360\nWe're going back.\n\n20:11.360 --> 20:12.360\nHold on to the poop story.\n\n20:12.360 --> 20:13.360\nHold on.\n\n20:13.360 --> 20:14.360\nHold on.\n\n20:14.360 --> 20:15.360\nGo ahead.\n\n20:15.360 --> 20:16.360\nNo.\n\n20:16.360 --> 20:17.360\nGo

20:23.720\nIt's a family fight right here on the stage.\n\n20:23.720 --> 20:25.200\nI'm going to love this.\n\n20:25.200 --> 20:26.200\nOkay, okay, okay.\n\n20:26.200 --> 20:27.200\nGod damn

20:31.200\nI met with the goddess and now it's off the rails.\n\n20:31.200 --> 20:32.520\nTake a look at the scarf story.\n\n20:32.520 --> 20:33.520\nIt's such a good story.\n\n20:33.520 --> 20:34.520\nOkay.\n\n20:34.520 --> 20:35.520\nYou guys...\n\n20:35.520 --> 20:36.520\nBuild it up.\n\n20:36.520 --> 20:37.520\nOkay, okay.\n\n20:37.520 --> 20:38.520\nI'm going to catch everybody.\n\n20:38.520 --> 20:39.520\nAll right.\n\n20:39.520 --> 20:40.520\nCatch them up.\n\n20:40.520 --> 20:41.520\nAll right.\n\n20:41.520 --> 20:45.240\nPreviously on the scarf story, mom is visiting New York.\n\n20:45.240 --> 20:46.880\nShe bought an outfit.\n\n20:46.880 --> 20:50.880\nShe got this long scarf, daughter not into it.\n\n20:50.880 --> 20:51.880\nI think...\n\n20:51.880 --> 20:52.880\nThat's all right.\n\n20:52.880 --> 20:57.320\nGet in dress to go meet the daughter and then...\n\n20:57.320 --> 20:58.320\nSo...\n\n20:58.320 --> 20:59.320\nAn unscheduled visitor.\n\n20:59.320 --> 21:00.320\nUnscheduled poop.\n\n21:00.320 --> 21:01.320\nYeah.\n\n21:01.320 --> 21:05.560\nLike, you know, your stomach starts to like turn and I'm going, oh fuck.\n\n21:05.560 --> 21:07.960\nIt's eight and 12 o'clock New York time.\n\n21:07.960 --> 21:09.720\nI'm way off my schedule.\n\n21:09.720 --> 21:11.360\nI got to go to the bathroom.\n\n21:11.360 --> 21:14.400\nSo it's like time to go meet you.\n\n21:14.400 --> 21:17.720\nAnd I said, well, I'm not going to take all my clothes off, my scarf, my hat, my gloves.\n\n21:17.720 --> 21:19.520\nI'm just going to go to the bathroom.\n\n21:19.520 --> 21:31.280\nSo I went and it was a mess because I got up and the scarf went into the toilet.\n\n21:31.280 --> 21:35.400\nMy $150 scarf into the...\n\n21:35.400 --> 21:36.400\nInto the potpourri.\n\n21:36.400 --> 21:39.000\nAnd you had shit on top of it.\n\n21:39.000 --> 21:40.000\nYeah.\n\n21:40.000 --> 21:41.000\nNo.\n\n21:41.000 --> 21:42.000\nNow the shit is all over the scarf.\n\n21:42.000 --> 21:45.680\nThe scarf had gone into the toilet and you shit on top of it.\n\n21:45.680 --> 21:46.680\nYeah.\n\n21:46.680 --> 21:47.680\nOkay.\n\n21:47.680 --> 21:48.680\nI walk in.\n\n21:48.680 --> 21:49.680\nYou shit on the scarf.\n\n21:49.680 --> 21:50.680\nIt was already shit in there.\n\n21:50.680 --> 21:51.680\nYeah.\n\n21:51.680 --> 21:53.000\nWhat do you mean there was shit already in there?\n\n21:53.000 --> 21:54.240\nI shit and when I got the scarf...\n\n21:54.240 --> 21:55.540\nHow would there be shit already in there?\n\n21:55.540 --> 21:56.540\nWait a minute.\n\n21:56.540 --> 21:57.540\nNo.\n\n21:57.540 --> 21:59.880\nBecause I got up in the scarf because it was so long went into the toilet.\n\n21:59.880 --> 22:00.880\nAww.\n\n22:00.880 --> 22:01.880\nWhat do you mean?\n\n22:01.880 --> 22:02.880\nI thought you sat...\n\n22:02.880 --> 22:06.480\nI thought before you sat the scarf went into the toilet and then you took a big dump on\n\n22:06.480 --> 22:07.480\nthe scarf.\n\n22:07.480 --> 22:08.480\nRight.\n\n22:08.480 --> 22:09.480\nRight.\n\n22:09.480 --> 22:10.480\nYou're saying the same thing.\n\n22:10.480 --> 22:11.480\nYou're saying the same thing now.\n\n22:11.480 --> 22:12.480\nWe're saying the same thing.\n\n22:12.480 --> 22:13.480\nYeah.\n\n22:13.480 --> 22:14.480\nOkay.\n\n22:14.480 --> 22:15.480\nAll right.\n\n22:15.480 --> 22:16.480\nGod, I thought...\n\n22:16.480 --> 22:17.480\nOkay.\n\n22:17.480 --> 22:18.480\nOh my God.\n\n22:18.480 --> 22:19.480\nYou shit on the scarf.\n\n22:19.480 --> 22:23.040\nYou shit on the scarf and just it had fringes.\n\n22:23.040 --> 22:26.360\nSo all the fringes were...\n\n22:26.360 --> 22:27.360\nSo I got...\n\n22:27.360 --> 22:28.360\nAnd I...\n\n22:28.360 --> 22:29.360\nSo I got up and I went...\n\n22:29.360 --> 22:31.880\nBut I feel like I walked in during some of this now.\n\n22:31.880 --> 22:32.880\nNo, you were gone.\n\n22:32.880 --> 22:33.880\nYou were gone.\n\n22:33.880 --> 22:34.880\nOkay.\n\n22:34.880 --> 22:35.880\nWell, if this...\n\n22:35.880 --> 22:38.480\nIf I had seen this, I would have flipped the fuck out because I remember...\n\n22:38.480 --> 22:39.480\nWait.\n\n22:39.480 --> 22:42.480\nIn the apartment, remember how I was just like always mad at you for making messes?\n\n22:42.480 --> 22:43.480\nRight.\n\n22:43.480 --> 22:44.680\nI would have flipped out if I knew that she...\n\n22:44.680 --> 22:45.680\nShe would have...\n\n22:45.680 --> 22:46.680\nSo you were trying to hide it from me.\n\n22:46.680 --> 22:51.600\nBecause what happened is so I took the scarf out and I started washing it, really scrubbing\n\n22:51.600 --> 22:53.400\nit down thinking, I could do this.\n\n22:53.400 --> 22:55.120\nI could make this happen.\n\n22:55.120 --> 23:04.920\nSo I scrubbed it down and then I took it and I laid it out on Cody's heater to dry it.\n\n23:04.920 --> 23:07.400\nShe was not happy.\n\n23:07.400 --> 23:08.400\nNothing smelled.\n\n23:08.400 --> 23:09.400\nShe washed it properly.\n\n23:09.400 --> 23:10.400\nIt was just the idea.\n\n23:10.400 --> 23:11.400\nIt was gone.\n\n23:11.400 --> 23:12.400\nIt was gone.\n\n23:12.400 --> 23:14.800\nIt was like a brand new scarf.\n\n23:14.800 --> 23:17.600\nSo I went to have lunch.\n\n23:17.600 --> 23:18.600\nWe...\n\n23:18.600 --> 23:21.160\nHe likes the story.\n\n23:21.160 --> 23:22.160\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n23:22.160 --> 23:30.040\nSo we came back and I said, Cody, the scarf that's on the dryer was full of shit.\n\n23:30.040 --> 23:31.680\nBut it's clean now.\n\n23:31.680 --> 23:32.680\nShe flipped out.\n\n23:32.680 --> 23:35.160\nShe goes, what do you mean you put it on my dryer?\n\n23:35.160 --> 23:36.160\nThe shit scarf.\n\n23:36.160 --> 23:37.160\nRight?\n\n23:37.160 --> 23:39.160\nBecause I have a little bit of a seedy.\n\n23:39.160 --> 23:40.160\nShe has a little seedy germaphobic...\n\n23:40.160 --> 23:41.160\nI will see the germaphobic...\n\n23:41.160 --> 23:42.160\nI'm a lot...\n\n23:42.160 --> 23:43.160\nAll right.\n\n23:43.160 --> 23:44.160\nI'm a lot better.\n\n23:44.160 --> 23:45.160\nYeah.\n\n23:45.160 --> 23:47.320\nSo the best part is...\n\n23:47.320 --> 23:49.840\nAnd I said, okay, now I got to go home to New York.\n\n23:49.840 --> 23:51.360\nSo I went back to New York.\n\n23:51.360 --> 23:52.360\nTo LA.\n\n23:52.360 --> 23:53.360\nTo LA.\n\n23:53.360 --> 23:54.360\nOh, I mean, sorry.\n\n23:54.360 --> 23:55.360\nLA.\n\n23:55.360 --> 23:57.040\nAnd the shit's gone to my friend.\n\n23:57.040 --> 24:01.680\nSo I went home and I kept the tissue paper and the bag from this store.\n\n24:01.680 --> 24:05.920\nSo I wrapped it up and I said, I'm going to fucking return this thing because I'm not\n\n24:05.920 --> 24:08.920\ngoing to wear a scarf that has poop on it.\n\n24:08.920 --> 24:09.920\nNo.\n\n24:09.920 --> 24:10.920\nNo.\n\n24:10.920 --> 24:13.160\nThere's no way that I am going to put a poop...\n\n24:13.160 --> 24:17.400\nI know that the poop is residue, you know?\n\n24:17.400 --> 24:23.920\nSo I went to the store and I went up to the lady and I said, I'd like to return this scarf.\n\n24:23.920 --> 24:25.720\nYou are a bad person.\n\n24:25.720 --> 24:27.200\nWait, wait, wait.\n\n24:27.200 --> 24:28.200\nPut a pin in that.\n\n24:28.200 --> 24:29.200\nOkay.\n\n24:29.200 --> 24:30.200\nWe're almost there.\n\n24:30.200 --> 24:31.200\nAll right.\n\n24:31.200 --> 24:35.320\nAnd she said to me, is there anything wrong with it?\n\n24:35.320 --> 24:36.320\nAnd you said...\n\n24:36.320 --> 24:38.760\nI said, no, no, no, no, it's fine.\n\n24:38.760 --> 24:41.920\nIt's just that I bought it for my daughter.\n\n24:41.920 --> 24:46.040\nAnd it's like 12 feet long and she's very short.\n\n24:46.040 --> 24:51.360\nAnd every time she wears it, she steps on it and trips, so I'd like to return it.\n\n24:51.360 --> 24:52.360\nThat was the...\n\n24:52.360 --> 24:54.360\nThat wasn't a very good stuff.\n\n24:54.360 --> 24:55.360\nGod damn it.\n\n24:55.360 --> 24:56.360\nThat's not the punchline.\n\n24:56.360 --> 24:57.360\nThat's how you said it.\n\n24:57.360 --> 24:58.360\nThat's how you said the first time.\n\n24:58.360 --> 24:59.360\nLet me finish the story.\n\n24:59.360 --> 25:00.360\nAll right.\n\n25:00.360 --> 25:02.160\nI'd like to return this scarf.\n\n25:02.160 --> 25:03.160\nShe said...\n\n25:03.160 --> 25:04.160\nAsk me why.\n\n25:04.160 --> 25:05.160\nWhat's wrong with it?\n\n25:05.160 --> 25:07.640\nWell, it's too long and my daughter didn't like it.\n\n25:07.640 --> 25:08.640\nYeah.\n\n25:08.640 --> 25:09.640\nThat's how you said it to us.\n\n25:09.640 --> 25:10.640\nWhich is true.\n\n25:10.640 --> 25:14.720\nBecause it's so long that it went in the toilet and it took a shit on it and your daughter\n\n25:14.720 --> 25:18.360\ndidn't like it because it was coated in shit.\n\n25:18.360 --> 25:22.200\nBut you just leave certain details out and then you return it, all right.\n\n25:22.200 --> 25:25.480\nIs somebody in New York walking around wearing a poops scarf?\n\n25:25.480 --> 25:26.480\nProbably.\n\n25:26.480 --> 25:27.480\nNo, I don't think...\n\n25:27.480 --> 25:28.480\nNo, no, in LA.\n\n25:28.480 --> 25:31.040\nThe reason that I didn't get that upset about it is because I was like, no one's ever gonna\n\n25:31.040 --> 25:32.540\nbuy this.\n\n25:32.540 --> 25:37.800\nThat's the kind of store where it has the clearance section and it will just disappear into oblivion.\n\n25:37.800 --> 25:40.320\nAnd so that's why I didn't admonish you.\n\n25:40.320 --> 25:41.320\nI was like...\n\n25:41.320 --> 25:45.600\nUltimately, when I found out, I was like, all right, it's a flawed thing a character would\n\n25:45.600 --> 25:46.600\ndo but...\n\n25:46.600 --> 25:54.480\nI have to say, Randy, that if you poop on a scarf, don't try to get the money back.\n\n25:54.480 --> 25:56.480\nWell, I did it.\n\n25:56.480 --> 25:58.840\nI was gonna exchange it for credit.\n\n25:58.840 --> 26:05.000\nFuck, I saved that one.\n\n26:05.000 --> 26:12.320\nI wanna segue into another guest that's like...I've been doing like a public television thing\n\n26:12.320 --> 26:16.680\nwhere we're like linking things and that's why it's emotionally complicated because you're\n\n26:16.680 --> 26:18.320\nmy future mom-in-law.\n\n26:18.320 --> 26:20.800\nYou pooped on a scarf.\n\n26:20.800 --> 26:22.240\nYou were Mama LaRusso.\n\n26:22.240 --> 26:23.240\nYou were...\n\n26:23.240 --> 26:26.280\nShe was Rizzo in Greece on Broadway.\n\n26:26.280 --> 26:27.280\nYou were Rizzo...\n\n26:27.280 --> 26:28.280\nShe was on Broadway.\n\n26:28.280 --> 26:29.280\nYou were the original Rizzo, right?\n\n26:29.280 --> 26:30.280\nWere you...\n\n26:30.280 --> 26:31.280\nNo, there was one original Rizzo.\n\n26:31.280 --> 26:32.280\nBut then...\n\n26:32.280 --> 26:34.280\nWere you the original Rizzo or not?\n\n26:34.280 --> 26:35.280\nYou were.\n\n26:35.280 --> 26:36.280\nYou still love me?\n\n26:36.280 --> 26:37.280\nWait.\n\n26:37.280 --> 26:38.280\nWell, no.\n\n26:38.280 --> 26:39.280\nBut I mean...\n\n26:39.280 --> 26:40.280\nBut after...\n\n26:40.280 --> 26:41.280\nWho played the original Rizzo?\n\n26:41.280 --> 26:42.280\nAdrian Barbo.\n\n26:42.280 --> 26:43.280\nNo.\n\n26:43.280 --> 26:44.280\nYeah.\n\n26:44.280 --> 26:45.280\nWait.\n\n26:45.280 --> 26:46.280\nOn Broadway, Adrian Barbo.\n\n26:46.280 --> 26:47.280\nOh, okay.\n\n26:47.280 --> 26:48.280\nReally?\n\n26:48.280 --> 26:49.280\nAdrian Barbo?\n\n26:49.280 --> 26:50.280\nYeah, Adrian Barbo.\n\n26:50.280 --> 26:51.280\nFrom Swamp Thing?\n\n26:51.280 --> 26:52.280\nHuh?\n\n26:52.280 --> 26:54.120\nI know her as Adrian Barbo from Swamp Thing.\n\n26:54.120 --> 26:55.120\nShe was an 80s...\n\n26:55.120 --> 26:56.120\nOh, right.\n\n26:56.120 --> 26:57.120\nYes.\n\n26:57.120 --> 26:58.120\nYes.\n\n26:58.120 --> 26:59.120\nLike she was...\n\n26:59.120 --> 27:00.120\nShe has big breasts.\n\n27:00.120 --> 27:01.120\nKind of like 80s B movie kind of thing.\n\n27:01.120 --> 27:02.120\nShe was the original.\n\n27:02.120 --> 27:03.120\nOkay.\n\n27:03.120 --> 27:05.600\nShe was a huge run of Rizzo on Broadway.\n\n27:05.600 --> 27:06.600\nYou were basically...\n\n27:06.600 --> 27:07.600\nTwo years.\n\n27:07.600 --> 27:08.600\nYeah.\n\n27:08.600 --> 27:10.960\nAnd so our next guest was...\n\n27:10.960 --> 27:11.960\nJohnny Angel.\n\n27:11.960 --> 27:12.960\nJohnny Angel.\n\n27:12.960 --> 27:13.960\nDoes anybody...\n\n27:13.960 --> 27:14.960\nDo you guys know Grease?\n\n27:14.960 --> 27:15.960\nTeen Angel.\n\n27:15.960 --> 27:16.960\nWhy is there Johnny Angel?\n\n27:16.960 --> 27:17.960\nTeen Angel.\n\n27:17.960 --> 27:18.960\nBeauty School Dropout, the

my birthday.\n\n27:48.080 --> 27:55.360\nMom, you got to talk into the mic.\n\n27:55.360 --> 27:56.360\nYeah.\n\n27:56.360 --> 28:03.360\nOkay, we know each other from college and then we did Godspell together and then Grease\n\n28:03.360 --> 28:05.760\ntogether on Broadway.\n\n28:05.760 --> 28:10.120\nSo we go back a long, long, 50 years, but he tells everybody I'm his nanny.\n\n28:10.120 --> 28:11.120\nYou're correct.\n\n28:11.120 --> 28:12.120\nSo, yeah.\n\n28:12.120 --> 28:13.120\nAnd a good one you were.\n\n28:13.120 --> 28:14.120\nOh, I was.\n\n28:14.120 --> 28:15.120\nThe best.\n\n28:15.120 --> 28:18.240\nBut Bob, there was a linkage here.\n\n28:18.240 --> 28:20.880\nI mean, look, I'm not a good podcast host.\n\n28:20.880 --> 28:23.720\nI'm not a good podcast producer.\n\n28:23.720 --> 28:25.520\nBut things happen.\n\n28:25.520 --> 28:33.320\nWe follow our guts and our feelings and stuff, and we recently lost a friend that we've talked\n\n28:33.320 --> 28:37.480\nabout many times on this podcast, like kind of in the periphery, like we've probably mentioned\n\n28:37.480 --> 28:43.720\nhis name a dozen or two dozen times in 300 and some episodes because he was so instrumental\n\n28:43.720 --> 28:44.720\nto our lives.\n\n28:44.720 --> 28:52.560\nThis guy, Sam Christensen, and he just recently passed a few weeks ago, and it was like very\n\n28:52.560 --> 28:59.080\nunexpected, and I know that weirdly, Randy had a connection to him.\n\n28:59.080 --> 29:04.480\nI mean, I know Sam knew you and Cody, but that was just like weird coincidence.\n\n29:04.480 --> 29:09.280\nAnd I said, Randy, will you come on the show and like now seems like a good time because\n\n29:09.280 --> 29:13.760\nmaybe you could tell some Sam stories and you're like, I don't know Sam well enough\n\n29:13.760 --> 29:20.160\nto like eulogize him, but Bob, who you've met, like was really close to him.\n\n29:20.160 --> 29:25.680\nYou saw him right before his passing, and so I thought, Kismet, we need to eulogize\n\n29:25.680 --> 29:31.640\nSam Christensen, someone that like he's not a household name, but if you've listened to\n\n29:31.640 --> 29:38.160\nthis podcast for hundreds of episodes, then Sam has like been caressing and touching you\n\n29:38.160 --> 29:47.480\nthe entire time because Jeff and I's origin stories go back and intertwine with Sam.\n\n29:47.480 --> 29:55.000\nSo for those of us, let's kind of like now just like remember him and start with how\n\n29:55.000 --> 29:57.720\ndid you meet Sam, Bob?\n\n29:57.720 --> 30:04.240\nWell, we were doing Godspell, and Sam was the liaison between the actors and the producers.\n\n30:04.240 --> 30:08.160\nHe worked for the producers, and he was so great.\n\n30:08.160 --> 30:11.720\nAnd every time he'd come to the theater, he'd say, by the way, tonight Paul Newman and\n\n30:11.720 --> 30:15.760\nJoanne Woodward are here, and they're not coming backstage because Paul doesn't come\n\n30:15.760 --> 30:21.800\nbackstage, and then Paul Newman would walk into the theater in an all-white suit in February.\n\n30:21.800 --> 30:22.800\nBut he...\n\n30:22.800 --> 30:24.280\nDo you know who Paul Newman is?\n\n30:24.280 --> 30:26.600\nI mean, they've heard of him.\n\n30:26.600 --> 30:27.600\nAnyway, he...\n\n30:27.600 --> 30:30.360\nHe's a salad dressing guy.\n\n30:30.360 --> 30:31.760\nThe salad dressing guy.\n\n30:31.760 --> 30:36.440\nI started doing Cabaret acts, and I didn't want to ruin my reputation with the owners,\n\n30:36.440 --> 30:41.960\nso I asked Sam to represent me, and that turned into him becoming my full-time manager.\n\n30:41.960 --> 30:47.440\nAnd then we became best friends, and then he ultimately got me to come out to Los Angeles\n\n30:47.440 --> 30:52.000\nfor meetings and manage me, and he became like my best friend.\n\n30:52.000 --> 30:58.080\nAnd somewhere along there, I don't know what date that is, but what I know of Sam is that\n\n30:58.080 --> 31:00.240\nhe's working with actors in this capacity.\n\n31:00.240 --> 31:03.840\nHe was an assistant to casting directors.\n\n31:03.840 --> 31:09.280\nHe worked on MASH in some capacity, like below the casting director, right?\n\n31:09.280 --> 31:11.080\nWell, this is how brilliant he was.\n\n31:11.080 --> 31:15.920\nHe started out working as an associate with the casting director, and then he opened his\n\n31:15.920 --> 31:18.320\nown agency, and he came out here.\n\n31:18.320 --> 31:22.240\nAnd one of the first things he cast was the movie Network.\n\n31:22.240 --> 31:27.360\nAnd he started to say, when he got the script, you have to cast Faye Dunneway in this part,\n\n31:27.360 --> 31:30.760\nand they said, oh, we can't afford Faye Dunneway, and she'll never do it, and we have a little\n\n31:30.760 --> 31:32.040\nbudget and everything.\n\n31:32.040 --> 31:37.760\nSo they brought in every B actress in Los Angeles to read for this part.\n\n31:37.760 --> 31:38.760\nAnd they kept saying...\n\n31:38.760 --> 31:39.760\nFor Network?\n\n31:39.760 --> 31:40.760\nFor Network.\n\n31:40.760 --> 31:41.760\nAnd why is nobody good?\n\n31:41.760 --> 31:45.680\nAnd he said, Faye Dunneway, why won't you let me...\n\n31:45.680 --> 31:46.680\nShe'll never do it.\n\n31:46.680 --> 31:47.680\nShe'll never do it.\n\n31:47.680 --> 31:48.680\nWe can't afford it.\n\n31:48.680 --> 31:50.720\nHe said, just let me get the script to her.\n\n31:50.720 --> 31:54.040\nI promise you, she'll pay you to do it.\n\n31:54.040 --> 31:59.200\nAnd they sent the script to her, and she said, I don't care what it cost you, what I get,\n\n31:59.200 --> 32:00.360\nI want to do this film.\n\n32:00.360 --> 32:02.160\nThen she won the Academy Award.\n\n32:02.160 --> 32:05.160\nSo then he opened his own agency and did MASH and did all these things.\n\n32:05.160 --> 32:06.160\nAnd he was...\n\n32:06.160 --> 32:09.360\nSam totally demuried when I asked him about that.\n\n32:09.360 --> 32:13.320\nHe made a song, he was just kind of an ancillary character in that story, but I didn't know\n\n32:13.320 --> 32:15.320\nthat he actually helped cast that movie.\n\n32:15.320 --> 32:16.320\nHe was the one.\n\n32:16.320 --> 32:17.880\nHe was the Faye Dunneway guy.\n\n32:17.880 --> 32:18.880\nWow.\n\n32:18.880 --> 32:21.000\nThat story makes perfect sense, and it makes perfect sense that Sam never told it that\n\n32:21.000 --> 32:22.000\nway.\n\n32:22.000 --> 32:24.440\nI had heard about him being involved with that, but he...\n\n32:24.440 --> 32:25.440\nYeah, he downplayed it.\n\n32:25.440 --> 32:30.160\nTo give some context, if you don't know who we're talking about, Sam, when I was 24 years\n\n32:30.160 --> 32:35.520\nold, I had a girlfriend who had taken his class, and he does this kind of essence workshop\n\n32:35.520 --> 32:39.000\nwhere you find out essentially who you are.\n\n32:39.000 --> 32:45.920\nAnd you get seven kind of statements to describe exactly why you are who you are, whether you\n\n32:45.920 --> 32:50.080\nlike it or not.\n\n32:50.080 --> 32:51.080\nAnd my...\n\n32:51.080 --> 32:54.240\nThe girlfriend at the time said, I was broke, and she goes, I need to find the money, take\n\n32:54.240 --> 32:56.760\nthe class, don't ask any questions.\n\n32:56.760 --> 33:02.600\nAnd I ended up doing it, and it really was the reason I started working, because you\n\n33:02.600 --> 33:04.280\nhave this self-knowledge.\n\n33:04.280 --> 33:08.840\nAnd then I told Dan and Rob and everybody, and I told Drew Carey about it, and Drew Carey\n\n33:08.840 --> 33:14.520\nnow still sent everybody, it's like, you have to find out who you are.\n\n33:14.520 --> 33:19.240\nAnd even if you think you know who you are, you don't have the permission to say out loud\n\n33:19.240 --> 33:21.160\nwhat it is that makes you you.\n\n33:21.160 --> 33:29.120\nAnd find out how people perceive you, because Sam's philosophy was, when you're on a playground,\n\n33:29.120 --> 33:30.360\nyou're starting to...\n\n33:30.360 --> 33:34.320\nYou're having this obsession with like, who am I, how do people perceive me?\n\n33:34.320 --> 33:40.200\nAnd the very things that make you unique, anything that makes you stand out, you're tall, you're\n\n33:40.200 --> 33:45.360\nshort, you're black, you have freckles, but more importantly, your personality, you're\n\n33:45.360 --> 33:48.920\nsloppy, you're neat, you're...\n\n33:48.920 --> 33:53.800\nYou're practicing being exceptional, and everyone else is practicing being everyone\n\n33:53.800 --> 33:55.720\nelse.\n\n33:55.720 --> 34:05.200\nAnd you go into your adulthood with these traumatic labels about the things that people\n\n34:05.200 --> 34:08.480\npointed out about you as you were developing.\n\n34:08.480 --> 34:15.560\nBecause whatever made you different than everyone else, absolutely this is not...\n\n34:15.560 --> 34:21.560\nSociety's job is to try to call you out and go, you're sloppier than everyone else.\n\n34:21.560 --> 34:27.280\nYou're fatter, you're taller, you're weirder, you're slower, you're faster.\n\n34:27.280 --> 34:32.080\nBut when you're a kid and you're developing, you're like, okay, I need to fix that shit,\n\n34:32.080 --> 34:34.600\nor I'm in big trouble.\n\n34:34.600 --> 34:39.240\nAnd it's right of you to want to fit in.\n\n34:39.240 --> 34:45.000\nBut then once you hit 18, 19, 20, it's time for you to drop that shit, actually.\n\n34:45.000 --> 34:49.880\nYour body's designed to drop that shit, but society's not designed to tell you when it's\n\n34:49.880 --> 34:54.440\ntime to let that go, because Sears and McDonald's are more than happy to step in and go, hey,\n\n34:54.440 --> 34:57.200\nyou don't want to be fucking weird, buy a Happy Meal, like no one's going to tell you\n\n34:57.200 --> 34:58.920\nto drop that shit.\n\n34:58.920 --> 35:03.880\nSam's class was telling you, okay, time to drop that shit.\n\n35:03.880 --> 35:06.960\nWhat sparks your shame?\n\n35:06.960 --> 35:12.320\nGo through his exercises, go through all your love letters from high school, go through\n\n35:12.320 --> 35:15.200\nyour yearbook signings.\n\n35:15.200 --> 35:20.320\nWe've been getting called the same names since we were children into our adulthood.\n\n35:20.320 --> 35:25.920\nAnd if somebody likes you, and let's say Dan, for instance, there's a way to describe how\n\n35:25.920 --> 35:27.400\nDan is smart.\n\n35:27.400 --> 35:33.880\nIf you like Dan, you say, oh, he's a genius, he's an intellect, he's a mastermind.\n\n35:33.880 --> 35:39.880\nIf you don't like Dan, you go, oh, he's a genius, and I hate him.\n\n35:39.880 --> 35:48.120\nBut being able to say in a couple words exactly how you're smart, Cody, and Bob, like what\n\n35:48.120 --> 35:57.200\nmakes you edgy, or what makes you the neighborhood of how we would describe you as being witty,\n\n35:57.200 --> 35:59.800\nbut precisely say it.\n\n35:59.800 --> 36:03.440\nAnd there's these words that we have all been called our whole lives.\n\n36:03.440 --> 36:07.640\nLike Sam pointed out early on when I first met him, and he said, Catherine Hepburn when\n\n36:07.640 --> 36:14.400\nshe was 18, or 19 when she did Philadelphia's story, every review called her feisty.\n\n36:14.400 --> 36:20.040\nWhen she was 80 something and she did Angold and Pond, everybody called her crusty.\n\n36:20.040 --> 36:26.720\nIf you're feisty at 18 and crusty at 80, what the essence is, is defiant.\n\n36:26.720 --> 36:30.320\nIsn't that like, you don't need men.\n\n36:30.320 --> 36:37.600\nAnd that's what made her great, was that all of her roles was, I don't need you.\n\n36:37.600 --> 36:40.920\nAnd if you're 18 or 80, it's a defiance.\n\n36:40.920 --> 36:44.160\nWe have different ways of saying what's special about you.\n\n36:44.160 --> 36:48.520\nTheir memories of what's said that's special about you on the playground are probably negative.\n\n36:48.520 --> 36:50.600\nThen you have lovers throughout your life.\n\n36:50.600 --> 36:52.920\nThey find the positive ways of saying it.\n\n36:52.920 --> 36:59.360\nIt doesn't really matter, and also crucially, it doesn't matter whether they're accurate.\n\n36:59.360 --> 37:06.240\nSam always used the example of Goldie Hawn, who is a very, very smart actor.\n\n37:06.240 --> 37:08.080\nShe could debate your ass off on any topic.\n\n37:08.080 --> 37:09.640\nShe happens to be intellectual.\n\n37:09.640 --> 37:15.920\nWhen she was young, it was her, the way the public wanted to perceive her, the way that\n\n37:15.920 --> 37:22.920\nshe would get gigs, it was like, people looked at her and said, you're an airhead, you're\n\n37:22.920 --> 37:31.040\na bimbo, you're a blonde, idiot, whatever, there's probably healthier ways to say that,\n\n37:31.040 --> 37:37.480\nbut that are equally not acknowledging the truth about her intellect or her depth.\n\n37:37.480 --> 37:42.960\nBut if you're presenting yourself to the public and you're for public consumption, it's not\n\n37:42.960 --> 37:47.440\nnecessarily a bad thing if people don't know everything about you.\n\n37:47.440 --> 37:52.040\nRight, because it's not the way you see you, but the way the world sees you.\n\n37:52.040 --> 37:53.040\nAnd that's what you have to discover.\n\n37:53.040 --> 37:55.920\nAnd that's what you have to step on that gas pedal and go, I always use the example of\n\n37:55.920 --> 38:02.840\nLouis Anderson, who would start his stand-up act, and he would do five or six fat jokes,\n\n38:02.840 --> 38:06.520\nand then he would pause and he'd wait, and the laughter subsided, and he goes, I start\n\n38:06.520 --> 38:11.760\nmy set with a bunch of fat jokes, because I know, it's like, oh, it's so predictable,\n\n38:11.760 --> 38:15.920\nbut also if I don't start my set that way, you guys are going to be out there for 45\n\n38:15.920 --> 38:20.000\nminutes, and some of you are going to be like, do you think he knows?\n\n38:20.000 --> 38:23.960\nAnd I always equated that with Sam's thing, where I was like, Charisma is Christopher\n\n38:23.960 --> 38:30.920\nWalken knowing he's creepy, Charisma is Jack Nicholson knowing he's dirty, Charisma is\n\n38:30.920 --> 38:37.280\na fat person leaning into the, they're like, well, I'm not going to try to convince you\n\n38:37.280 --> 38:38.280\nI'm not fat.\n\n38:38.280 --> 38:44.160\nThat has nothing to do with me endorsing body shaming or thinking it's better to be thin\n\n38:44.160 --> 38:45.160\nor whatever.\n\n38:45.160 --> 38:52.680\nIt's just like, there's a weird energy you exude the day you go, well, I'm kind of on\n\n38:52.680 --> 39:00.800\nthe same page with how I am perceived at first glance, and it kind of blows your mind, it's\n\n39:00.800 --> 39:08.320\nactually more likely that you're way off because of the amount of refraction, and I just remember\n\n39:08.320 --> 39:09.320\nthe exercises that we did.\n\n39:09.320 --> 39:13.320\nCan you tell us about the airport thing, because that was the one that was really interesting?\n\n39:13.320 --> 39:15.920\nYeah, I've said it on the show before too, it's like, just a rush through it, but it\n\n39:15.920 --> 39:19.680\nwas like, that was my big eye opener, where I was like, okay, this guy's not full of shit.\n\n39:19.680 --> 39:23.720\nWe went to the airport, it was pre-911, so you could just walk around the airport.\n\n39:23.720 --> 39:28.640\nAnd we would do this exercise, where we handed out forms and...\n\n39:28.640 --> 39:33.640\nYeah, it sounded like the worst idea, like, oh, this sounds like a horrible homework assignment,\n\n39:33.640 --> 39:35.640\nto go to the airport with somebody else in my class.\n\n39:35.640 --> 39:39.040\nSo people all around the international terminal are handed these forms and they go, so your\n\n39:39.040 --> 39:43.480\nclassmates say, look at that guy, so that guy's me, I don't say a word, I'm just leaning\n\n39:43.480 --> 39:44.480\ninto the pillar.\n\n39:44.480 --> 39:46.680\nYeah, like standing 100 feet away over by a pillar and you go like that.\n\n39:46.680 --> 39:50.200\nAnd you have this sheet in front of you with 300 words on it, and they don't give you a\n\n39:50.200 --> 39:54.640\nlimit, they don't ask you to engage like doing it right or wrong, and just circle any word\n\n39:54.640 --> 39:57.240\nthat you think applies to that guy over there, right there.\n\n39:57.240 --> 40:00.920\nHe's down with it, it's fine, you can stare at him, we're part of a psychology class,\n\n40:00.920 --> 40:02.680\nwe would say.\n\n40:02.680 --> 40:06.840\nAnd so they'd sit there, circle, people from Poland, people from Memphis, people from Fort\n\n40:06.840 --> 40:10.200\nLauderdale, like you're just in this LAX terminal.\n\n40:10.200 --> 40:15.320\nYou do that for five hours, you leave LAX with a giant stack of papers, you go home,\n\n40:15.320 --> 40:21.000\nyou tabulate everything, and then I'm like, why the fuck does everyone in the world think\n\n40:21.000 --> 40:22.000\nI'm sarcastic?\n\n40:22.000 --> 40:23.000\nAnd lazy.\n\n40:23.000 --> 40:30.000\nAnd you're just standing there, I went with a guy that looked like Charles Bronson, he\n\n40:30.000 --> 40:36.760\nwas a weird dude, and we got in the car and we did like 50 of them, and he's going through\n\n40:36.760 --> 40:47.880\nme, he's looking from side to side, he's like, what the fuck, what, god damn it, what does\n\n40:47.880 --> 40:48.880\neverybody think I'm suspicious?\n\n40:48.880 --> 40:52.640\nAnd Schrab went into the weekend class with Schrab, you're not supposed to look at your\n\n40:52.640 --> 40:56.520\ncards when you go to lunch, by the way, you were told.\n\n40:56.520 --> 40:57.520\nWhat?\n\n40:57.520 --> 40:58.520\nWhat is it?\n\n40:58.520 --> 41:04.520\nSo Schrab looked at his cards, apparently, because we did the same class, we were there\n\n41:04.520 --> 41:05.520\nfor hours.\n\n41:05.520 --> 41:10.760\nSo this is classmates writing down things about you, you take the class and your other\n\n41:10.760 --> 41:15.040\nclassmates write shit down as you get this exercise, okay, go to lunch, that was my\n\n41:15.040 --> 41:21.560\nimpression of Sam, and Schrab and I were walking down the sidewalk, and Schrab's like, and I'm\n\n41:21.560 --> 41:27.160\nlike, what's wrong, he's like, nothing, what did you get on your cards, and I didn't look\n\n41:27.160 --> 41:32.000\nat my cards, you're not supposed to look at your cards, and Schrab's like, and I'm like,\n\n41:32.000 --> 41:35.480\nokay, obviously you looked at your cards, what's your problem, and Rob goes, I am\n\n41:35.480 --> 41:36.480\nnot C-3PO.\n\n41:36.480 --> 41:51.800\nWaving his hands around with his elbows locked at 90 degrees, as if, as if, first of all,\n\n41:51.800 --> 41:58.480\nfirst of all, if I did that, I would be nothing like C-3PO, because he never did that.\n\n41:58.480 --> 42:03.280\nAnthony Daniels fucking, no, no, you're, you're embellishing to, to, okay, well, that's how\n\n42:03.280 --> 42:06.800\nI remember it, because you're Coney C-3PO.\n\n42:06.800 --> 42:13.280\nSam, part of the class, which is amazing, is like, he gives you, you kind of find out\n\n42:13.280 --> 42:18.000\nmythologically who you are, and like what your myth is, like where you live on Mount\n\n42:18.000 --> 42:22.560\nOlympus, and what the story is that you tell, because all of our favorite like actor and\n\n42:22.560 --> 42:26.960\nactresses, they all kind of portray the same role in different ways, but they're always\n\n42:26.960 --> 42:33.320\nkind of fulfilling a same kind of myth, and I asked Sam, was it, what's your myth?\n\n42:33.320 --> 42:39.160\nAnd he said, mine is to remove fear, and, and if, you could say anything great about\n\n42:39.160 --> 42:44.520\nSam, and there's lots of great things to say, Sam took fear away from people, and he gave\n\n42:44.520 --> 42:46.360\nyou like freedom.\n\n42:46.360 --> 42:50.240\nHe created this environment where I was, I was in my 20s, I was the worst version of\n\n42:50.240 --> 42:54.080\nme, and that's me talking, I'm already not a good person.\n\n42:54.080 --> 42:58.880\nEven me at 25, like where I'm like still cutting my teeth, being a human being, and\n\n42:58.880 --> 43:00.840\nit's like, but there was this space.\n\n43:00.840 --> 43:04.720\nAnyways, I think what we wanted to do is like, like we could have, we could have at any point\n\n43:04.720 --> 43:09.520\ntalked about, oh, these are Sam's superpowers, this is why you should be interested in them.\n\n43:09.520 --> 43:15.480\nI think Bob, your contribution to it is, you were, you were very close to him for, for\n\n43:15.480 --> 43:20.680\nhis whole life, and I, I, I asked you backstage, it kind of caught me off guard, it was like,\n\n43:20.680 --> 43:25.360\nwhen's the last time you saw him, because we saw him relatively recently, but you saw\n\n43:25.360 --> 43:27.800\nhim two weeks ago.\n\n43:27.800 --> 43:31.920\nWell, he'd come to my house every Friday night and we'd watch Bill Maher and we'd cook,\n\n43:31.920 --> 43:34.320\nand one of the things, talk about taking away fear.\n\n43:34.320 --> 43:35.320\nYeah.\n\n43:35.320 --> 43:37.120\nYou know, I just got a soup maker, right?\n\n43:37.120 --> 43:42.200\nSo I said, I'm going to make soup for you, and my new soup maker, which takes 18 minutes.\n\n43:42.200 --> 43:48.280\nSo I make this soup, and he said, he tastes it, and he says, yeah, yeah.\n\n43:48.280 --> 43:54.600\nAnd I said, what do you mean, yeah, he said, it's, it's good, but what would make it great\n\n43:54.600 --> 43:58.120\nis if you added an entire lemon to the soup.\n\n43:58.120 --> 44:01.800\nSo I squeezed the lemon into the soup, and he said, this is the best soup I've ever\n\n44:01.800 --> 44:02.800\nhad.\n\n44:02.800 --> 44:06.000\nWell, he's kind of, he's, he's pulling a little trick there.\n\n44:06.000 --> 44:10.000\nHe's, he's like, I think I'll create a story where I knew exactly what needed to be in\n\n44:10.000 --> 44:11.000\nthe soup.\n\n44:11.000 --> 44:12.000\nExactly.\n\n44:12.000 --> 44:13.000\nAnd then he's like, it was great.\n\n44:13.000 --> 44:16.240\nWhen you did Sam's class, the first part, back, when I did it back in the old days,\n\n44:16.240 --> 44:20.800\nlike, and like when you still could go to the airport and do that thing, later it became\n\n44:20.800 --> 44:25.880\nmore like online and internet based and faster.\n\n44:25.880 --> 44:28.720\nYou would do the class, you would get your essences, and then if you wanted to keep going,\n\n44:28.720 --> 44:33.400\nyou would do an acting class where you, you get a placard and you would put on a music\n\n44:33.400 --> 44:37.080\nstand with your seven statements about who you were.\n\n44:37.080 --> 44:41.560\nAnd it's the kind of the neighborhoods of, like, all the things people know about you\n\n44:41.560 --> 44:45.560\non site, but you don't know that people know that, and it was just getting used to admitting\n\n44:45.560 --> 44:48.500\nthat and knowing that people saw that stuff.\n\n44:48.500 --> 44:51.120\nAnd then you would do a monologue.\n\n44:51.120 --> 44:52.120\nSo you could be anything.\n\n44:52.120 --> 44:55.640\nIt could be a, I, I, I did something from network or you could do something from Shakespeare\n\n44:55.640 --> 44:57.720\nor whatever the, whatever the hell.\n\n44:57.720 --> 45:04.960\nAnd there was a guy in the class, it was a black guy, a really good actor, and he did\n\n45:04.960 --> 45:08.800\nthis piece where it was like a really angry piece, I forget what it was.\n\n45:08.800 --> 45:12.300\nAnd he had a ball cap on and Sam goes, let's do it again.\n\n45:12.300 --> 45:19.480\nI want you to turn your hat a little bit to the side, and instantly the guy looked furious.\n\n45:19.480 --> 45:22.960\nAnd he goes, just do it again, and turn your ball cap to the side.\n\n45:22.960 --> 45:25.760\nAnd he did it, and it was the fucking best acting you've ever saw.\n\n45:25.760 --> 45:29.880\nAnd when it was over, he instantly put his hat back straight, and Sam goes, why does\n\n45:29.880 --> 45:30.880\nthat make you so angry?\n\n45:30.880 --> 45:34.240\nHe goes, I don't want to be thought of as the guy that has the ball cap to the side.\n\n45:34.240 --> 45:38.440\nHe goes, you see how close your anger is?\n\n45:38.440 --> 45:44.000\nLike if you need it, all you have to do is be thought of or perceived as less than you\n\n45:44.000 --> 45:45.000\nare.\n\n45:45.000 --> 45:48.880\nRight, well that's the thing is like if people think that you, if you find out what your\n\n45:48.880 --> 45:53.920\nessence is, that's equally empowering if you want to play the opposite of it or whatever,\n\n45:53.920 --> 45:56.360\nlike being able to tap into your stuff.\n\n45:56.360 --> 46:01.280\nOne thing I'm curious about Bob now that he's gone, like you knowing Sam probably better\n\n46:01.280 --> 46:08.320\nthan, than, than us on stage, like, how did Sam like, did Sam have, did Sam have, did\n\n46:08.320 --> 46:15.080\nlike, where, where was he at, he was, he was this kind of guru, he had this studio in Burbank.\n\n46:15.080 --> 46:19.640\nMy perception of him was always that he, he had plans to make it bigger.\n\n46:19.640 --> 46:23.520\nHe would do the internet version, and he was like, he was trying to, he was trying to empire\n\n46:23.520 --> 46:29.160\nbuild, which I totally relate to, which I have tried to do, like, oh, I'm not enough\n\n46:29.160 --> 46:31.280\nthat I'm just going to do what I do.\n\n46:31.280 --> 46:37.440\nWas Sam, was he frustrated about the business of being Sam, or was he content with it?\n\n46:37.440 --> 46:38.760\nNo, he was content.\n\n46:38.760 --> 46:44.000\nFirst of all, he did a lot of traveling from, to New York and Atlanta and all over the country,\n\n46:44.000 --> 46:46.400\nand he'd go for weeks at a time.\n\n46:46.400 --> 46:51.280\nAnd that was very rewarding to him, because he blossomed this business to reach so many\n\n46:51.280 --> 46:57.920\npeople, but it was a business of really having people center in on who they really are and\n\n46:57.920 --> 47:03.520\nhow to maneuver them, their, their, themselves through life in a successful way.\n\n47:03.520 --> 47:06.080\nAnd that was incredibly rewarding to him.\n\n47:06.080 --> 47:12.080\nIt just seems like such a, that's good, I'm glad that, because from my perspective, I\n\n47:12.080 --> 47:17.840\nalways thought when I heard he passed, it was like, oh God, he never, he had just retired,\n\n47:17.840 --> 47:21.200\nand he didn't, like, it was such a thankless job.\n\n47:21.200 --> 47:25.840\nHe just put up with a bunch of dipshits, like me, forever, like we just kept gathering\n\n47:25.840 --> 47:30.720\nat his feet and he would go, all right, Dan, that's an interesting choice in that fight\n\n47:30.720 --> 47:32.000\nclub monologue.\n\n47:32.000 --> 47:36.720\nWhat, what, what do you like about your mother, my mother, what does that have to do with\n\n47:36.720 --> 47:37.720\nfight club?\n\n47:37.720 --> 47:38.720\nWhat color was your mother's hair?\n\n47:38.720 --> 47:39.720\nI don't know.\n\n47:39.720 --> 47:40.720\nBrown go.\n\n47:40.720 --> 47:43.360\nHow's that working out for you?\n\n47:43.360 --> 47:44.360\nFight club?\n\n47:44.360 --> 47:45.360\nYeah, do it better.\n\n47:45.360 --> 47:49.120\nIt just seemed like, by the way, I never chose the fight club monologue, fuck you if you\n\n47:49.120 --> 47:50.120\ndid.\n\n47:50.120 --> 47:51.960\nCan we, can we find out your words, though?\n\n47:51.960 --> 47:54.480\nI want to know your seven words.\n\n47:54.480 --> 47:56.320\nOh, I can't remember all seven.\n\n47:56.320 --> 48:00.600\nBob, did you actually, did you, did you take Sam's kind of class where you got your\n\n48:00.600 --> 48:01.600\nessences?\n\n48:01.600 --> 48:07.080\nWell, I got my essences from living my life as his best friend, but what was interesting\n\n48:07.080 --> 48:11.800\nto me is when I started out in Cabaret, he said to me at one point, so who do you see\n\n48:11.800 --> 48:12.800\nyourself as?\n\n48:12.800 --> 48:15.840\nAnd it was in the days of Bonnie and Clyde with Warren Beatty.\n\n48:15.840 --> 48:18.440\nAnd I said, well, I think I'm the Warren Beatty of song.\n\n48:18.440 --> 48:20.040\nAnd he said, you're not.\n\n48:20.040 --> 48:21.040\nYou're not.\n\n48:21.040 --> 48:23.120\nYou're the fade done away, I'm fine.\n\n48:23.120 --> 48:25.080\nYou're the fade done away.\n\n48:25.080 --> 48:29.720\nSo he said, he said, so here's the thing.\n\n48:29.720 --> 48:32.120\nHe said, you're in God's spell.\n\n48:32.120 --> 48:34.520\nYou get laughs every night.\n\n48:34.520 --> 48:41.240\nNow what you have to do is start talking between numbers in this act and be who you are with\n\n48:41.240 --> 48:47.360\nyour humor instead of just singing one song to the next song to the next song, which helped\n\n48:47.360 --> 48:49.000\nme discover who I was.\n\n48:49.000 --> 48:54.040\nAnd then once I was authentically me, I was able to attract people in record companies\n\n48:54.040 --> 48:58.360\nto be interested in me because I wasn't trying to be Warren Beatty anymore.\n\n48:58.360 --> 49:02.080\nEven though in my mind, I was secretly wishing I could be.\n\n49:02.080 --> 49:07.160\nWe all have that person that we target, we think, like, oh, I wish I was like them.\n\n49:07.160 --> 49:11.680\nAnd the curious thing is that you might, by virtue of some random experience, you might\n\n49:11.680 --> 49:15.120\nactually find yourself being someone else's thing.\n\n49:15.120 --> 49:19.640\nAnd what a crime it is that that person's looking at someone who's thinking, I wish\n\n49:19.640 --> 49:24.840\nI was Bill Murray, like, well, that person doesn't wish you that you were Bill Murray.\n\n49:24.840 --> 49:27.040\nThat person may or may not know who Bill Murray is.\n\n49:27.040 --> 49:32.280\nIt's like, I always wonder where you're supposed to draw those lines.\n\n49:32.280 --> 49:37.960\nWe have these mentors, these figures, oh, I had an epiphany while I was watching this\n\n49:37.960 --> 49:41.800\nperson do stand-up or perform, like, I wish I was Garry Shandling.\n\n49:41.800 --> 49:45.760\nI wish I was David Foster Wallace.\n\n49:45.760 --> 49:46.760\nI wish I was this.\n\n49:46.760 --> 49:47.760\nI wish I was that.\n\n49:47.760 --> 49:50.640\nLike, what are you supposed to construct your identity out of if it's not other primates\n\n49:50.640 --> 49:54.120\naround you who have done things that you've admired?\n\n49:54.120 --> 49:58.160\nAnd yet somewhere within there, you're supposed to just be yourself.\n\n49:58.160 --> 50:00.960\nAnd it's the most useless advice in the world.\n\n50:00.960 --> 50:04.720\nBut Sam somehow was able to get into that yoke.\n\n50:04.720 --> 50:09.920\nI remember like half of your essences, Dan, and probably like a few of yours, Rob.\n\n50:09.920 --> 50:14.880\nBut like when, because I took it first, and then you start telling everybody, go take\n\n50:14.880 --> 50:17.480\nthis class whether you're an actor or not.\n\n50:17.480 --> 50:22.160\nLike it's really valuable no matter what you do, like that self-knowledge thing.\n\n50:22.160 --> 50:27.560\nAnd it sounds culty to talk about, but it really was, this is beautiful.\n\n50:27.560 --> 50:32.520\nThere's no way to express how much Sam means to people.\n\n50:32.520 --> 50:33.520\nIt was super culty.\n\n50:33.520 --> 50:39.720\nBut like when Rob took it, like, when I got my essences, Sam tells me, he's like, there's\n\n50:39.720 --> 50:43.320\ngoing to be one essence that's going to be kind of an epiphany for you that you're going\n\n50:43.320 --> 50:46.360\nto go, oh, that's how I say that.\n\n50:46.360 --> 50:51.440\nAnd he told me, like, we were trying to talk about my, the neighborhood of my poise or\n\n50:51.440 --> 50:53.400\nmy confidence.\n\n50:53.400 --> 50:54.920\nAnd if you don't like me, I'm arrogant.\n\n50:54.920 --> 50:56.360\nIf you like me, I'm poised.\n\n50:56.360 --> 50:58.360\nIf you, like, there's that thing.\n\n50:58.360 --> 51:02.120\nAnd he wrote down a thing, and he put on a piece of paper and slid it across the desk.\n\n51:02.120 --> 51:06.120\nHe goes, anybody else would hate this, but I think you're going to like it.\n\n51:06.120 --> 51:11.760\nAnd it was the neighborhood of my confidence or cockiness or whatever.\n\n51:11.760 --> 51:16.600\nAnd it was not conceded, just convinced.\n\n51:16.600 --> 51:18.800\nAnd I hit the fucking desk, I go, exactly.\n\n51:18.800 --> 51:21.240\nI said, I don't think I'm better than you.\n\n51:21.240 --> 51:22.760\nI know I'm better than you.\n\n51:22.760 --> 51:25.080\nAnd we're like, I almost started crying.\n\n51:25.080 --> 51:31.240\nAnd the one that Rob had, my favorite one for you, Rob, last puppy at the pound.\n\n51:31.240 --> 51:36.320\nLove it, that's great.\n\n51:36.320 --> 51:37.320\nThat's not the one.\n\n51:37.320 --> 51:38.320\nI see that one.\n\n51:38.320 --> 51:39.320\nI don't, I don't.\n\n51:39.320 --> 51:40.320\nI love that.\n\n51:40.320 --> 51:43.280\nRob's that I remember is waiting for permission.\n\n51:43.280 --> 51:46.520\nAlso my favorite, my other favorite is Little Green Man.\n\n51:46.520 --> 51:47.520\nYeah.\n\n51:47.520 --> 51:49.320\nLike you're from outer space.\n\n51:49.320 --> 51:53.280\nAnd then next year, you dressed up as Little Green Man for Halloween, and it was the best\n\n51:53.280 --> 51:54.280\noutfit of all time.\n\n51:54.280 --> 51:55.280\nThat's true.\n\n51:55.280 --> 51:56.280\nIt was a good one.\n\n51:56.280 --> 51:59.560\nAnd what about, fuck the dog, but won't admit it?\n\n51:59.560 --> 52:00.560\nHe got you on that one.\n\n52:00.560 --> 52:01.560\nYou're doing this again.\n\n52:01.560 --> 52:02.560\nI love that.\n\n52:02.560 --> 52:03.560\nYeah, you're doing this.\n\n52:03.560 --> 52:04.560\nThis is what you're doing.\n\n52:04.560 --> 52:12.600\nSome of Harmon's, the overwriting one for me is, and it sounds weird, but it's perfect.\n\n52:12.600 --> 52:17.680\nIt's mud monster on shore leave.\n\n52:17.680 --> 52:18.680\nThat's the one that I like.\n\n52:18.680 --> 52:23.200\nWell, Sam would say, some of these are your own.\n\n52:23.200 --> 52:25.200\nIt doesn't need to make sense to other people.\n\n52:25.200 --> 52:26.880\nIt's for you to recalibrate.\n\n52:26.880 --> 52:31.840\nAnd actually I forgot, I refer to last year being rough for me, and it's precisely because\n\n52:31.840 --> 52:32.840\nI forgot.\n\n52:32.840 --> 52:40.720\nIt's like, oh god, you're a mud monster on shore leave, which to me means your story\n\n52:40.720 --> 52:47.200\ndoesn't get to be about, like, all right, well, whatever.\n\n52:47.200 --> 52:48.200\nSam.\n\n52:48.200 --> 52:54.960\nThe other ones of Dan's unspeakable sadness came alone and leaving likewise.\n\n52:54.960 --> 52:56.960\nI love that one.\n\n52:56.960 --> 53:04.520\nYeah, they were rough, but that's not, yeah, some people, you don't get the essences you\n\n53:04.520 --> 53:05.520\nwant.\n\n53:05.520 --> 53:06.520\nYou get the ones you need.\n\n53:06.520 --> 53:08.440\nCan I ask you a question?\n\n53:08.440 --> 53:12.920\nSome of these are so poetic that you're saying there was a list of 300 that people would\n\n53:12.920 --> 53:14.880\ncircle, so these were written by them.\n\n53:14.880 --> 53:15.880\nThose are just words.\n\n53:15.880 --> 53:16.880\nThe words would be like sarcastic, lazy.\n\n53:16.880 --> 53:21.200\nYou would get there, you would collate all this information, and you would find out,\n\n53:21.200 --> 53:24.240\nlike, okay, everybody's calling you sarcastic or sardonic, witty.\n\n53:24.240 --> 53:26.360\nI know, but like, mud monster on shore leave.\n\n53:26.360 --> 53:27.360\nBut Sam would just write it down.\n\n53:27.360 --> 53:32.520\nSam would just, he would make these pitches, he'd slide them across the table.\n\n53:32.520 --> 53:33.520\nLook at that.\n\n53:33.520 --> 53:38.880\nAnd I'd go, oh, the evolution of that was like, the mud monsters always welcome at the ball\n\n53:38.880 --> 53:39.880\nor something like that.\n\n53:39.880 --> 53:46.240\nIt was sort of like, and I was like, yeah, but I don't, I don't, I suppose he is, but\n\n53:46.240 --> 53:47.240\nI would do a monologue.\n\n53:47.240 --> 53:48.240\nGive a fuck.\n\n53:48.240 --> 53:51.800\nI brought a monologue in for the acting class, like after that, a whole process, and it was\n\n53:51.800 --> 53:58.160\nlike this tough guy, asshole, like, like kind of a mean, angry monologue, and I was trying\n\n53:58.160 --> 53:59.160\nto be a tough guy.\n\n53:59.160 --> 54:01.720\nAnd he goes, okay, Jeff, that was good, let's do it again.\n\n54:01.720 --> 54:06.280\nAnd you have your card up, you're placard with all your essences on it, which is, you\n\n54:06.280 --> 54:11.640\nknow, kind of like, you feel very exposed, because you're proud of some, embarrassed\n\n54:11.640 --> 54:14.120\nby others, but they're there.\n\n54:14.120 --> 54:20.320\nAnd he goes, Jeff, why is, because one of my essences was dashing, pardon, dashing.\n\n54:20.320 --> 54:22.240\nIt gets you choked up how dashing you are.\n\n54:22.240 --> 54:23.240\nNo, sorry.\n\n54:23.240 --> 54:24.240\nSee?\n\n54:24.240 --> 54:26.440\nIsn't that dashing him?\n\n54:26.440 --> 54:28.120\nAnd he goes, Jeff, why is dashing on that?\n\n54:28.120 --> 54:29.120\nI go, I don't like that one.\n\n54:29.120 --> 54:32.720\nThat's why, because someone, someone that's dashing wouldn't say they're dashing.\n\n54:32.720 --> 54:34.680\nAnd he goes, do it again.\n\n54:34.680 --> 54:41.000\nAnd I did it as dashing, you know, and it was way scarier, like, like, if you just like\n\n54:41.000 --> 54:42.320\nown anything.\n\n54:42.320 --> 54:47.360\nHe told one guy, he goes, do it again, but sit on your hands.\n\n54:47.360 --> 54:50.160\nHe goes, you can't use your hands, now do it.\n\n54:50.160 --> 54:53.080\nAnd it was the most terrifying thing in the world.\n\n54:53.080 --> 54:58.040\nHe just had this way to bring out something by the turn of your hat, or a little thing.\n\n54:58.040 --> 55:03.200\nOr like, if it was Randy, and you go, do it, like, see the way you're tilting your head?\n\n55:03.200 --> 55:06.680\nLike, why do you, like, why do you do that?\n\n55:06.680 --> 55:08.240\nI always do it.\n\n55:08.240 --> 55:09.240\nNow start.\n\n55:09.240 --> 55:17.440\nAnd then, like, it brings out the stuff, like, he's like, you, your tears, like, if people\n\n55:17.440 --> 55:22.600\nthat think they can't cry on camera, or can't cry on command, like, in a play or a TV show\n\n55:22.600 --> 55:27.880\nor a film, it's so close to the surface, like, really, all you have to do is slightly scratch\n\n55:27.880 --> 55:32.320\nthe surface and just say, what, why do you tilt your head?\n\n55:32.320 --> 55:33.320\nWhy are you listening like that?\n\n55:33.320 --> 55:34.920\nI always do.\n\n55:34.920 --> 55:37.200\nAnd there's tears that come from that.\n\n55:37.200 --> 55:45.000\nAnd like, he had this ability to absolutely draw humanity out of yourself that you think\n\n55:45.000 --> 55:49.840\nshouldn't be there, couldn't be there, you're not allowed to possess it, or it's too far\n\n55:49.840 --> 55:50.840\naway to own.\n\n55:50.840 --> 55:57.920\nLike, he just had this ability, I mean, I'll fucking start crying.\n\n55:57.920 --> 55:58.920\nLike he...\n\n55:58.920 --> 56:12.560\nBut, Bob, what do you think, like, okay, we've lost Sam, nobody leaves, nobody gets to, like,\n\n56:12.560 --> 56:18.080\ngo, oh, I'm scheduled to leave a month from now, here's what I got to say, goodbye, I'm\n\n56:18.080 --> 56:24.560\npacking my things, like, it sounds like he left kind of weirdly peacefully, relatively\n\n56:24.560 --> 56:32.320\nyoung man to, as you described it, he said he was at the home of his partner and he just\n\n56:32.320 --> 56:37.640\nsaid, I feel faint and he laid his head down on the table and he was gone.\n\n56:37.640 --> 56:40.520\nBut how old was he again?\n\n56:40.520 --> 56:41.520\n70.\n\n56:41.520 --> 56:46.160\nWhich, I hope, is the new 50, for my sake.\n\n56:46.160 --> 56:52.600\nI thought, I always thought, I felt like Sam was 60 when I was 25, and he looked 60 the\n\n56:52.600 --> 57:00.720\nlast time I saw him a couple of months ago, he was, anyways, but he, for a guy that was,\n\n57:00.720 --> 57:06.280\nhe was always like, he took other people's fear away, he was interested in them, no matter\n\n57:06.280 --> 57:12.520\nhow much of a schmendrick they were, he was so non-judgmental, or at least he just gave\n\n57:12.520 --> 57:19.000\neverybody a chance to figure out who the fuck they were.\n\n57:19.000 --> 57:24.560\nNow that he's gone, do you feel a door closing where you're like, oh shit, what did Sam want\n\n57:24.560 --> 57:25.800\nfrom me?\n\n57:25.800 --> 57:27.280\nDoes that make sense?\n\n57:27.280 --> 57:32.520\nIs there something that you worry about personally that you're like, oh shit, if Sam had known\n\n57:32.520 --> 57:38.920\nhe was going to take off, and I had had a chance to say to him, hey, not to be even more selfish\n\n57:38.920 --> 57:46.040\nthan I was our entire relationship, but any final thoughts?\n\n57:46.040 --> 57:49.560\nThat he might have given you some advice or given you an idea?\n\n57:49.560 --> 57:54.400\nI don't feel that there were things that were unfinished between us, because we were always\n\n57:54.400 --> 57:59.480\nvocal about how important we were to each other in our lives.\n\n57:59.480 --> 58:07.160\nHe was about to start a new chapter, because he had bought a house in Asheville, in North\n\n58:07.160 --> 58:08.160\nCarolina.\n\n58:08.160 --> 58:10.640\nNailed it.\n\n58:10.640 --> 58:15.200\nSo there was a part of him that was beginning this new chapter, and I don't know whether\n\n58:15.200 --> 58:19.520\nthat had anything to do with his passing, that it was the end of one chapter and the\n\n58:19.520 --> 58:21.400\nbeginning of another.\n\n58:21.400 --> 58:24.360\nBut I know how rewarded he was.\n\n58:24.360 --> 58:29.120\nI wish I could have said goodbye to him, but I don't feel like there was anything unfinished\n\n58:29.120 --> 58:30.520\nbetween us.\n\n58:30.520 --> 58:36.040\nWe were always very vocal about each other, each other's lives, what was ahead of us as\n\n58:36.040 --> 58:38.480\nfar as projects and dreams.\n\n58:38.480 --> 58:42.480\nYou guys got together and you watched Bill Maher, and Sam was always very, he made no\n\n58:42.480 --> 58:47.880\nsecrets about his politics, and yet his politics were sort of like, he wasn't like, to me,\n\n58:47.880 --> 58:51.480\nhe wasn't like militant liberal, like, oh my God, we have to do something, but at the\n\n58:51.480 --> 58:58.920\nsame time, he was absolutely unapologetic about an incredibly well-versed politician.\n\n58:58.920 --> 59:00.080\nSo he's watching Bill Maher.\n\n59:00.080 --> 59:04.320\nHe's obviously, he's able to put up with Bill Maher's personality.\n\n59:04.320 --> 59:09.560\nThat means that you guys sat week after week, and you talked about his view of the world.\n\n59:09.560 --> 59:16.600\nAnd so I guess that's the related question is, I don't want to be as corny as to say,\n\n59:16.600 --> 59:20.680\nif Sam were here right now, what would he say to us knowing that he gets one last thing\n\n59:20.680 --> 59:21.680\nto say to us?\n\n59:21.680 --> 59:25.520\nBut I guess that's, I don't know, something in that area, like Sam had an opinion about\n\n59:25.520 --> 59:30.840\nthe world and the way it was going and stuff, like I, would he give it, like, we're like,\n\n59:30.840 --> 59:35.720\nhey Sam, what should we remember to do now that you're gone and you're never going to\n\n59:35.720 --> 59:42.640\nremember, remind us to do it again, like, I put that upon you, it's a really dumb podcast.\n\n59:42.640 --> 59:47.640\nOne of the things that he wanted was for Trump and Pence to both be taken down and have Nancy\n\n59:47.640 --> 59:48.640\nPelosi be president.\n\n59:48.640 --> 59:49.640\nOh, okay.\n\n59:49.640 --> 59:50.640\nThat's simple enough.\n\n59:50.640 --> 59:52.640\nWe can get to the nuts and bolts of that.\n\n59:52.640 --> 59:56.680\nYou know, he just felt like, let somebody who knows what the fuck they're doing be in\n\n59:56.680 --> 59:57.680\nthere.\n\n59:57.680 --> 01:00:00.160\nIt'd be funny because he's like Santa Claus, like, Santa, what do you want from the world?\n\n01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:02.280\nI want Nancy Pelosi to be president.\n\n01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:05.480\nNo, make no mistake, I've got really specific.\n\n01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:12.240\nOh, I need the 23rd district to flip.\n\n01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:13.760\nAnd he was predicting everything.\n\n01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:20.400\nLike he said, I think what's going to happen is that they're going to bring down Donald\n\n01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:26.240\nTrump Jr. and Jared and go to Trump and say, listen, this is what we're going to do.\n\n01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:28.600\nYou better resign or this is going to happen.\n\n01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:32.520\nI had that prediction too, as of the Roger Stone indictment too, that it actually comes\n\n01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:36.040\ndown to Donald Jr. that it's not going to touch Trump at all.\n\n01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:40.800\nI don't think that it's going to, I have that premonition, I've been reading like the experts\n\n01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:46.880\nkind of like speculation about this, I believe it actually, like, I do actually believe as\n\n01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:51.760\ncontroversial as this may seem that Donald Trump had no capacity to actually do anything\n\n01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:59.600\nbut blunder his way into accidental treason, like he never was like, I get a great idea\n\n01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:02.040\nabout like how to like be Dr. No.\n\n01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:06.920\nI think he totally thought he was just like, I'm winning and I know how to win.\n\n01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:18.760\nAnd I think his son, who is half as smart somehow, was way too far and like took meetings\n\n01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:23.040\nand left a paper trail and it's going to come to him.\n\n01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:24.320\nHappy birthday, Sam.\n\n01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:32.000\nWe're talking about this, but that it's, I don't see it coming to, it's, that's, I\n\n01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:35.120\nmean, that's the weird telenovela that I don't, how is that going to work?\n\n01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:38.400\nThey're going to go, hey, we're locking your son away.\n\n01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:41.360\nAnd then he's going to go, that's all right, I'm going to pardon him.\n\n01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:47.340\nAnd everyone's going to go, yay, like pardon him later.\n\n01:01:47.340 --> 01:01:48.600\nSo long, son.\n\n01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:49.600\nI'm proud of you.\n\n01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:50.840\nLike, like, how does the pardoning work?\n\n01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:52.720\nLike you can't do it until later, right?\n\n01:01:52.720 --> 01:02:00.320\nSo like, people are going to watch him, watch his son go to prison.\n\n01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:07.280\nThat's my prediction and it's going to, it's going to finally find the funny bone of this\n\n01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:09.840\ndead corpse of an empire.\n\n01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:12.960\nLike everyone's going to go, that's fucking weird.\n\n01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:18.920\nWhat do you think, you're just watching your son go to prison, like no wall, no Mexican\n\n01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:23.800\nis that important, but I can't fucking like believe what you're doing.\n\n01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:35.320\nWhat do you think Sam would, essences for Trump would be?\n\n01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:36.480\nWhat are Trump's essences?\n\n01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:42.000\nLike I, I search out like, like, like, well, just be like, like, like, like, he kind of,\n\n01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.440\nhe kind of spouts them out.\n\n01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:47.880\nI mean, I think like, like, like if you were, you could be a fan of his by going like, yeah,\n\n01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:54.800\nhe said, he would be his, his essences would be like, I'm big, very big, or like, it would\n\n01:02:54.800 --> 01:03:00.560\nbe like, like toy truck language, like, like my truck big.\n\n01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:03.520\nAnd it would be exactly why when you love him, you love him.\n\n01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:10.960\nIf you love him, he'd be like, my truck big, like I get more candy, like I deserve all\n\n01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:11.960\nthe candy.\n\n01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:18.320\nOr, or hemorrhoidal, hemorrhoidal, a little bit, with a little touch out of seven essences,\n\n01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:22.560\nlike two of them would be like, they would evoke pain, like, like, like, like, how come\n\n01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:27.680\nObama made me hooked on opiates or something, like, I have this kind of like thumbs sucky,\n\n01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:30.920\nlike why is everybody picking on me, like just a hint of that.\n\n01:03:30.920 --> 01:03:38.280\nBut most of it would be like, like, like, me, me, no share, me candy, like, and it would\n\n01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:43.720\nbe like, like, yeah, that's, it's about time someone said that, because if, because I'm\n\n01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:44.720\na fucking idiot.\n\n01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:45.720\nNow do me.\n\n01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:50.120\nLike, you're not doing, that wasn't a Trump, no, I'm saying, your essence is, as far as\n\n01:03:50.120 --> 01:04:05.440\nI can tell are, I love handsome people, I'm sorry, we're listening to this podcast on\n\n01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:13.960\nmy phone, I will continue to hit snooze every 10 minutes, so that you'll never find out\n\n01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:17.960\nwhat the sentence was, because you just, you burned me.\n\n01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:18.960\nDamn.\n\n01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:19.960\nThat's good.\n\n01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:23.360\nThat's like, we're listening to the podcast and it's like, like, come on, it was nine\n\n01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:24.360\nsnoozes ago.\n\n01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:25.360\nGet up.\n\n01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:29.920\nI only did it twice this morning, come on, you're being, I'm projecting a lot of shame\n\n01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:38.040\nabout my snoozing, um, I don't know, don't put me on the spot, sorry.\n\n01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:41.240\nAll right, what were, what were your other ones from?\n\n01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:44.200\nI don't remember the other, those are the only three I remember.\n\n01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:45.200\nReally?\n\n01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:50.480\nYeah, I don't remember them, but the first, those, those top three were, I mean, well,\n\n01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:53.520\nlast puppy at the pound, last puppy at the pound is a little green man.\n\n01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:54.520\nYeah.\n\n01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:55.520\nThose two were the big ones.\n\n01:04:55.520 --> 01:05:02.080\nI think Sam, like, well, Sam's here, Sam's watching, Sam, now, then he goes away after\n\n01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:06.320\nthe show, as far as this being on stage, like, when you, when you think of anything, Sam\n\n01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:10.560\nwould like to see us do as an exercise or anything to show him.\n\n01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:14.640\nI think you'd like us all to have nipple rings that you can see through, that you can see\n\n01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:15.640\nthrough his t-shirt.\n\n01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:19.520\nHe looked like Santa Claus, but then if he, he would wear it, he was like fucking ripped,\n\n01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:22.520\nlike, like in this like bear daddy way.\n\n01:05:22.520 --> 01:05:23.520\nThat is so hot.\n\n01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:27.240\nI think if you had nipple rings, and oh my God, I can see it.\n\n01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:31.920\nHe would wear like polo shirts and he had this like kind of painted on beautiful white\n\n01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:36.600\nbeard, razor sharp hair, and he'd be like, I want to tell you how you need to activate\n\n01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:38.240\nyourself and what you'd be honest with yourself.\n\n01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:41.840\nAnd then you'd like, if you squinted, you'd be like, this guy's got two pierced nipples\n\n01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:46.200\nunderneath, underneath his incredibly tasteful polo.\n\n01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:48.200\nRock on, baby.\n\n01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:51.000\nWhat year was your birthday that we roasted you and Sam was there?\n\n01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:52.000\n30th birthday.\n\n01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:53.600\nIt was for Dan's 30th birthday.\n\n01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:55.920\nWe haven't, I think we have it on video somewhere, right?\n\n01:05:55.920 --> 01:05:56.920\nOh, that'd be great.\n\n01:05:56.920 --> 01:05:58.920\nI can't wait for that to surface.\n\n01:05:58.920 --> 01:05:59.920\nYeah.\n\n01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:02.920\nCan I do more than quit Twitter?\n\n01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:07.000\nBy the way, I quit Twitter and then they fucking, all right.\n\n01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:08.000\nWe roasted Dan.\n\n01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:09.000\nThe timeline.\n\n01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:17.560\nAnd I said, when Sam was dating Ken Cortland, who's the best also, and one of Ken's essences\n\n01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:19.560\nwas predatory.\n\n01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:20.560\nYeah.\n\n01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:21.560\nYeah.\n\n01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:27.040\nAnd when he said, he goes, I'm predatory, and he's like, oh shit, I'm in danger right\n\n01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:28.040\nnow.\n\n01:06:28.040 --> 01:06:38.560\nI roasted Sam, and one of my jokes was, Sam gave me my, Sam is so old that he gave me my\n\n01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:39.560\nstart.\n\n01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:46.360\nThis is your joke, and it's nice to think that the guy that gave me my start also invented\n\n01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:47.360\nfire.\n\n01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:48.360\nYeah.\n\n01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:49.360\nAll right.\n\n01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:56.680\nI think it's, I don't know if things feel like, see, I'm kind of in a certain sense,\n\n01:06:56.680 --> 01:07:00.880\nhe discovered me, which is very flattering because he also discovered fire.\n\n01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:07.520\nIt's just a roast joke, and it wasn't worth the feeding, but to fuck it up like that is,\n\n01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:09.080\nand that poop scarf story.\n\n01:07:09.080 --> 01:07:14.480\nI mean, you went out of your way, like you, truthfully, with the way I heard the story,\n\n01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:15.680\nyou were a hero.\n\n01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:17.160\nYou made yourself a villain.\n\n01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:21.440\nIt was so, because it was like- I think it's because she was like self-aware of being about\n\n01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:22.440\nhow the story got off.\n\n01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:26.160\nIt was just like, I looked at the scarf, and I was like, hey, why the fuck did I ever have\n\n01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:27.160\nto take any shit?\n\n01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:32.840\nI'm going to take this shit and fucking pawn it off on him.\n\n01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:35.360\nWhen I heard the story over brunch, I was like, holy shit.\n\n01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:38.920\nIt was just like, when we went through it, she took, you took a shit on the scarf, and\n\n01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:41.400\nthen you took it back.\n\n01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:42.400\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:44.360\nI'm not giving, I'm not giving you notes.\n\n01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:46.360\nNo, you are.\n\n01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:48.720\nNo, I'm bad.\n\n01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:49.720\nI'm bad.\n\n01:07:49.720 --> 01:07:54.720\nNo, mom, you're doing a great job.\n\n01:07:54.720 --> 01:07:56.480\nYou're doing a great job.\n\n01:07:56.480 --> 01:07:58.160\nThank you for- I'm so happy.\n\n01:07:58.160 --> 01:08:00.800\nGive it up for Randy Heller, everybody.\n\n01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:01.800\nCome on.\n\n01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:02.800\nMama.\n\n01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:10.040\nI have a good story to share about Randy, actually, that I think it will make up for\n\n01:08:10.040 --> 01:08:11.040\nany character-\n\n01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:12.440\nTo see him drive through it?\n\n01:08:12.440 --> 01:08:15.600\nI feel like he would, because I feel like one of my words is that.\n\n01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:16.600\nAll right.\n\n01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:21.440\nOkay, so one of the words I would say that I am is the game that my mom used to play\n\n01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:27.600\nwith me, which is called Wild Fish, and basically I would spend a lot of time in the bathtub,\n\n01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:34.160\nwhich side note, it was because we had a jacuzzi tub and I had discovered masturbating because\n\n01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:38.920\nyou could sit up on the thing, and I had this book called Where Did I Come From, which was\n\n01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:45.280\nan illustrated book explaining sex to kids, which happened to- I mean, it was hot.\n\n01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:48.360\nIt was like, you could spend time on it.\n\n01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:50.480\nSo it was like, where did I come from?\n\n01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:51.480\nPage two.\n\n01:08:51.480 --> 01:08:52.560\nOh, pussy.\n\n01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:55.040\nPage three, and you've got one.\n\n01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:56.040\nPage four.\n\n01:08:56.040 --> 01:08:57.040\nCheck it out.\n\n01:08:57.040 --> 01:08:58.040\nNo, no, no, no.\n\n01:08:58.040 --> 01:08:59.280\nNo, no, no, no, no.\n\n01:08:59.280 --> 01:09:07.800\nIt's a romantic tale about a mom and a dad, and they're kind of a heavy set couple.\n\n01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:10.040\nThey're just like a normal- like the dad is balding.\n\n01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:11.800\nIt's a very realistic portrayal of just-\n\n01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:13.240\nThis is how I hit the jackpot.\n\n01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:16.000\nYou do look a lot like the dad in Where Did I Come From.\n\n01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:17.760\nI don't know whether to feel good or bad about this.\n\n01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:18.760\nNo, she's hot.\n\n01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:19.760\nI just mansion you into it.\n\n01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:20.760\nNo, he's hot.\n\n01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:21.760\nHe's hot.\n\n01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:22.760\nHe's hot.\n\n01:09:22.760 --> 01:09:26.520\nBut it explained, you know, when a mom and a dad or a man and a woman meet and are in\n\n01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:30.720\nlove, I mean, this was before, you had, you know, this was just heteronormative, like,\n\n01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:33.480\n80s stuff, but it was still pretty hot.\n\n01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:36.880\nBut they're like, mom and a dad, they want to get so close to each other because they\n\n01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:37.880\nlove each other so much.\n\n01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:42.880\nSo like, when they hug each other, the penis of the dad goes inside of the vagina of\n\n01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:43.880\nthe mom.\n\n01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:49.120\nAnd then when it feels really good, it's like, it feels like a big buildup and then a release,\n\n01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:50.840\nlike a sneeze.\n\n01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:54.040\nAnd somehow, this is just a side note, by the way, about the Wildfish story.\n\n01:09:54.040 --> 01:09:56.120\nSorry, this has nothing to do with Wildfish.\n\n01:09:56.120 --> 01:10:02.360\nBut as a weird thing, because I read that and absorbed it into my brain, now when I get\n\n01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:04.120\nturned on, sometimes I sneeze.\n\n01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:08.200\nAnd it's because in my brain, it got programmed in weird from that book.\n\n01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:11.400\nBut anyway, so I love taking these baths.\n\n01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:16.400\nAnd then my mom would be like, and the Wildfish existed before I was aware of my sexuality.\n\n01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:17.400\nBut anyway.\n\n01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:18.400\nThis guy, like, let me book in this.\n\n01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:23.280\nI promise it'll be helpful because our couple's therapist was like, hey, let me just ask you\n\n01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:24.280\nguys something.\n\n01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:25.280\nMe and Cody.\n\n01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:29.720\nShe's like, why don't you guys describe the, what was it like, did you guys take baths\n\n01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:31.720\nwhen you were a kid?\n\n01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:32.720\nWhat was that like?\n\n01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:34.640\nAnd then Cody, go ahead.\n\n01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:35.640\nNow explain what happened.\n\n01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:40.240\nSo I love taking baths, and even before the book and all that, I just love being in the\n\n01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:43.640\nbath and pretending, you know, just playing and going on in the bath forever.\n\n01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:47.400\nSo to get me to lure me out of the bath, my mom would be like, OK, we're going to time\n\n01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:49.040\nto play Wildfish.\n\n01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:54.240\nAnd she would get out the big duvet cover from the bed, the whole thing, the comforter\n\n01:10:54.240 --> 01:10:55.240\nfrom the bed.\n\n01:10:55.240 --> 01:10:57.840\nAnd she would, I would get out of the bath, she would wrap me in a towel and like two\n\n01:10:57.840 --> 01:11:00.040\ntowels, one on my head, one on my body.\n\n01:11:00.040 --> 01:11:04.080\nAnd then she would wrap me up in the comforter in like a big dumpling.\n\n01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:06.840\nShe would like wrap all of me up in there.\n\n01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:12.560\nAnd she would drag me around the house, like in this thing, over the hardwood floors.\n\n01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:17.560\nAnd she would do the voices of like, basically the premise was that I was a Wildfish.\n\n01:11:17.560 --> 01:11:21.440\nShe was an activist who like was saving me from the zoo.\n\n01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:25.360\nWe were like going through the zoo and she would do the different voices like a security\n\n01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:29.360\nguard would come and be like, ma'am, I'm going to have to see what's in the bag there.\n\n01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:34.560\nAnd she'd be like, oh, nothing, officer, this is no, this is not, it's certainly not a Wildfish.\n\n01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:35.560\nNo.\n\n01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:39.280\nAnd she would like, and it was the most fun ever.\n\n01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:42.440\nAnd yeah, it makes me want to have a kid to play a Wildfish with them.\n\n01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:44.200\nIt was really magical.\n\n01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:59.280\nAnd Dan, Dan, and I would go, uh, I, I remember the water getting very cold.\n\n01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:06.000\nAnd eventually going, hello.\n\n01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:11.000\nMy brother and I would take real, real, real little, we would take baths together and we,\n\n01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:14.600\nwe had a game called pee-pee monster.\n\n01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:18.520\nAnd somebody would pee in the bathtub, but you had to, you had to stand up on the edge\n\n01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:24.640\nof the bathtub and try to knock, knock the other brother into the pee.\n\n01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:26.880\nBecause the pee was a monster.\n\n01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:32.760\nAnd also because pee, the pee, like you're saying, like, oh, well, once the pee was in\n\n01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:37.760\nthe tub, like you get up on the ledge, you're skirting the edges of it.\n\n01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:40.920\nWhy did you have to avoid it because it was a monster?\n\n01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:43.720\nIt's already pee.\n\n01:12:43.720 --> 01:12:45.760\nWhy was the game called pee-pee monster?\n\n01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:47.760\nYou could have said, stop at the first pee.\n\n01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:48.760\nYeah.\n\n01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:49.760\nWell, one thing.\n\n01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:50.760\nI peed in the tub.\n\n01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:53.760\nI don't want to touch it.\n\n01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:54.760\nBut is it a monster?\n\n01:12:54.760 --> 01:12:57.520\nOkay, now I really don't want to touch it.\n\n01:12:57.520 --> 01:12:58.520\nIt's piss.\n\n01:12:58.520 --> 01:12:59.920\nYou pee in a pool.\n\n01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:00.920\nWhat the fuck?\n\n01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:01.920\nGross.\n\n01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:02.920\nReally gross.\n\n01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:03.920\nReally gross.\n\n01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:04.920\nCongratulations.\n\n01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:12.920\nYou and your brother gross.\n\n01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:13.920\nJust gross.\n\n01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:14.920\nSweet.\n\n01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:17.280\nI once took a shit in the tub.\n\n01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:21.280\nRemember, when Sloan was in there with me and she freaked out, my sister, we were taking\n\n01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:23.080\na bath together and I, I mean, I was, yeah.\n\n01:13:23.080 --> 01:13:25.320\nShe think it was a shark.\n\n01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:27.320\nI mean, I don't remember, but she freaked out, right?\n\n01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:29.320\nShe was like, yeah, she wasn't not happy about it.\n\n01:13:29.320 --> 01:13:30.320\nShe's like, I'm done now.\n\n01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:31.320\nShe's 13.\n\n01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:36.320\nI'm done.\n\n01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:38.640\nRandy saved my life, you know.\n\n01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:39.640\nTell it.\n\n01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:40.640\nOkay.\n\n01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:41.720\nSounds like content.\n\n01:13:41.720 --> 01:13:45.440\nWe were, we were walking and Sam was hysterical at this story.\n\n01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:46.640\nEverybody is, I hope.\n\n01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:53.960\nSo we were walking out of a grocery store and this car comes zooming through the parking\n\n01:13:53.960 --> 01:14:00.080\nlot and Randy pulled me back and she started screaming at this woman in the car.\n\n01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:01.560\nShe said, what's wrong with you?\n\n01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:03.800\nYou almost killed my friend.\n\n01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:09.760\nAnd in the car was this very heavy set African-American woman with nine children.\n\n01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:14.720\nAnd she looks at us and she goes, didn't you see me not looking?\n\n01:14:14.720 --> 01:14:22.240\nAll right, I'm going to get some emails about that one.\n\n01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:25.280\nThank God we don't check our emails.\n\n01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:26.280\nYou read it.\n\n01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:28.160\nI have an issue with H-Cow.\n\n01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:33.720\nThat reminded me briefly, like you can say, no, I don't want to tell that story.\n\n01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:41.840\nThere was a good story about Bruce Willis slapping you, like, okay, that's the whole\n\n01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:42.840\nstory.\n\n01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:48.600\nBut no, but it wasn't like, it was like, he was like leaning in the car on Sunset Boulevard\n\n01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:49.600\nor whatever.\n\n01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:50.600\nHe's like, hey, what's going on?\n\n01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:51.600\nWhere's the party?\n\n01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:55.080\nAnd you're like, it was like the eighties and you were like, I don't know, Bruce Willis.\n\n01:14:55.080 --> 01:14:56.080\nWhat are you?\n\n01:14:56.080 --> 01:15:01.640\nAnd then he like, what do you do that for talking to the microphone?\n\n01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:03.840\nHe was very high.\n\n01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:10.200\nAll right, well, let's call that the gossip section so that nobody like, I just, I forgot\n\n01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:11.200\nthe world we're living in.\n\n01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:14.280\nI thought like, Bruce Willis called out for slapping.\n\n01:15:14.280 --> 01:15:15.280\nWas it?\n\n01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:16.280\nOkay, back up.\n\n01:15:16.280 --> 01:15:23.480\nSo was it like a Pulp Fiction or Ving Reim situation where you're Bruce Willis and Bruce\n\n01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:24.800\nWillis is Ving Reims?\n\n01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:29.600\nLike you stop and Bruce Willis sticks his head in the car and just say, hey, you know, welcome\n\n01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:30.600\nto California.\n\n01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:31.600\nI'm Bruce Willis.\n\n01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:39.520\nHe was like, I know who you are and he just slapped you and went, check it out.\n\n01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:43.120\nWhat did you think of that?\n\n01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:49.280\nAnd you were like, okay, well, that just happened.\n\n01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:53.640\nOr were you like, like, like, was it, it was, did it bum you out?\n\n01:15:53.640 --> 01:15:54.640\nLike you were.\n\n01:15:54.640 --> 01:15:55.640\nNo, it was a shock.\n\n01:15:55.640 --> 01:15:59.320\nI was just sitting there.\n\n01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:01.840\nWhat was his, what, why did he slap you?\n\n01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:02.840\nWhat precipitated that?\n\n01:16:02.840 --> 01:16:03.840\nAnd nothing at all.\n\n01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:05.600\nOr just, he's just being Bruce Willis.\n\n01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:09.600\nI don't know, it's like to do with me returning a poop scarf or something.\n\n01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:10.600\nI don't know.\n\n01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:11.600\nI don't know.\n\n01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:12.600\nYeah.\n\n01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:13.600\nHe was coming out to make it.\n\n01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:14.600\nIt was a playful.\n\n01:16:14.600 --> 01:16:15.600\nOkay.\n\n01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:16.600\nWhat the kids call it.\n\n01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:17.600\nHe was negging you.\n\n01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:18.600\nHe was negging you.\n\n01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:23.240\nLike, like it was like, oh, if I treat her, she'll go like, well, what's he selling?\n\n01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:30.680\nI was married and I, and I, and I, and I, if you weren't married, would you have, if\n\n01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:35.280\nyou were not married, would you have, you know, probably, I don't know.\n\n01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:36.280\nI don't know.\n\n01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:37.280\nI don't know.\n\n01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:38.280\nI don't know.\n\n01:16:38.280 --> 01:16:39.280\nI don't know.\n\n01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:40.280\nThat's such a random thing for my past.\n\n01:16:40.280 --> 01:16:41.280\nYeah.\n\n01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:42.280\nYeah.\n\n01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:45.280\nIf I wasn't married, I would, I would fuck Bruce Willis.\n\n01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:46.280\nOh, look, he's here.\n\n01:16:46.280 --> 01:16:47.280\nHe's here.\n\n01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:48.280\nHe's here.\n\n01:16:48.280 --> 01:16:49.280\nHe's here.\n\n01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:50.280\nBruce Willis is here.\n\n01:16:50.280 --> 01:16:51.280\nBruce Willis is here.\n\n01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:52.280\nHe's here.\n\n01:16:52.280 --> 01:16:53.280\nOh, he's slapping everybody.\n\n01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:54.280\nOh, God.\n\n01:16:54.280 --> 01:16:55.280\nOh, he's slapping everybody.\n\n01:16:55.280 --> 01:16:56.280\nHey, Bruce.\n\n01:16:56.280 --> 01:16:57.280\nWait, what are you doing?\n\n01:16:57.280 --> 01:16:58.280\nBruce, wait, come on.\n\n01:16:58.280 --> 01:16:59.280\nTake it easy.\n\n01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:00.280\nBruce, it's a new segment.\n\n01:17:00.280 --> 01:17:01.280\nWhat are you doing, Bruce?\n\n01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:02.280\nOkay, go for it.\n\n01:17:02.280 --> 01:17:03.280\nNo, be Bruce.\n\n01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:04.280\nBe Bruce.\n\n01:17:04.280 --> 01:17:05.280\nOh, my God.\n\n01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:06.280\nAnd then he went to the next car.\n\n01:17:06.280 --> 01:17:10.280\nI was trying to build it out into a thing where you're like Daniel Tiger and Mr. Rogers.\n\n01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:11.280\nYeah.\n\n01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:13.280\nBruce, what time is it?\n\n01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:15.280\nLet's reenact the scenario.\n\n01:17:15.280 --> 01:17:17.280\nSo, Randy, you're driving your car.\n\n01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:18.280\nBruce Willis comes up.\n\n01:17:18.280 --> 01:17:19.280\nI was in the passenger seat.\n\n01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:20.280\nWe pulled up to in front of the...\n\n01:17:20.280 --> 01:17:22.280\nWait, well, first of all, eat the mic.\n\n01:17:22.280 --> 01:17:23.280\nI'm so bad about this.\n\n01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:26.280\nAnd second of all, vocalize what you're doing like...\n\n01:17:26.280 --> 01:17:27.280\nI wasn't driving.\n\n01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:31.280\nLike, I don't mean to feed you lines, but like, you'd be like, hey, it's me, Mama LaRusso.\n\n01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:33.280\nI'm on the Hollywood Boulevard.\n\n01:17:33.280 --> 01:17:35.280\nI'm not even sure if I had done that already.\n\n01:17:35.280 --> 01:17:36.280\nI don't think I did.\n\n01:17:36.280 --> 01:17:37.280\nWell, it was then...\n\n01:17:37.280 --> 01:17:38.280\nThis is free LaRusso.\n\n01:17:38.280 --> 01:17:39.280\nFix it, rewrite it.\n\n01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:43.280\nNo, we just pulled up, my friend and I, to the improvist, Karen Brooks.\n\n01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:44.280\nYou know what I'm saying?\n\n01:17:44.280 --> 01:17:45.280\nKaren Brooks?\n\n01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:46.280\nYeah.\n\n01:17:46.280 --> 01:17:47.280\nYou were going to the improv to see...\n\n01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:49.280\nNo, I don't know why we were pulling up in front of the improv.\n\n01:17:49.280 --> 01:17:50.280\nHe came out from the improv.\n\n01:17:50.280 --> 01:17:51.280\nBecause that's where the strip was hottest.\n\n01:17:51.280 --> 01:17:57.280\nHe came by and he put his head down in the car and he goes, where are you girls going?\n\n01:17:57.280 --> 01:18:00.280\nAnd I said...\n\n01:18:00.280 --> 01:18:05.280\nAnd first I said, shit, that's Bruce Willis.\n\n01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:07.280\nWait, but you knew him from what?\n\n01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:08.280\nMoonlighting?\n\n01:18:08.280 --> 01:18:09.280\nWhat?\n\n01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:10.280\nProbably.\n\n01:18:10.280 --> 01:18:11.280\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:12.280\nWe're going back here.\n\n01:18:12.280 --> 01:18:13.280\nWe're going really far back.\n\n01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:16.280\nAnd I just said, you know, we're not going anywhere.\n\n01:18:16.280 --> 01:18:17.280\nI don't know what I said.\n\n01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:18.280\nWhere were you going?\n\n01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:19.280\nWere you going to the improv?\n\n01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:22.280\nHe put his hand in the car and slapped me across the face.\n\n01:18:22.280 --> 01:18:23.280\nWhat the fuck?\n\n01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:24.280\nWas it playful, though?\n\n01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:26.280\nYou were pulling into...\n\n01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:27.280\nWait, it seems like you liked it.\n\n01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:29.280\nWhy are they questioning me?\n\n01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:30.280\nYou were...\n\n01:18:30.280 --> 01:18:31.280\nWas it playful?\n\n01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:32.280\nWhy didn't you report it?\n\n01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:33.280\nTell me what happened.\n\n01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:34.280\nWhy didn't you report it?\n\n01:18:34.280 --> 01:18:35.280\nIt wasn't before the days of Me Too.\n\n01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:38.280\nOkay, but was it playful or was it really hard?\n\n01:18:38.280 --> 01:18:42.280\nI think he was pissed off because I rejected him.\n\n01:18:42.280 --> 01:18:43.280\nHe was pissed off.\n\n01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:45.280\nI would have slapped you.\n\n01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:50.280\nLearn to take a compliment.\n\n01:18:50.280 --> 01:18:53.280\nI think I might have mentioned this on the show before.\n\n01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:58.280\nHe once knocked me over at a bar because I was with a girl that looked a little too\n\n01:18:58.280 --> 01:18:59.280\nmuch like Demi Moore.\n\n01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:00.280\nYeah, there you go.\n\n01:19:00.280 --> 01:19:02.880\nAnd he jumped over a thing and just fucking...\n\n01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:08.280\nHe hockey checked me up against the boards and I almost went to the ground.\n\n01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:09.780\nHe absolutely nailed me.\n\n01:19:09.780 --> 01:19:12.080\nIt wasn't because he was trying to.\n\n01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:15.000\nHe saw a girl he wanted to talk to and I was in the way.\n\n01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:16.000\nHe was right.\n\n01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:17.000\nExactly.\n\n01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.280\nAnd he completely just fucking shoulder-checked me.\n\n01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:23.280\nWhat would be his Sam Essence for Bruce Willis?\n\n01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:24.280\nDouchebag.\n\n01:19:24.280 --> 01:19:25.280\nCome on.\n\n01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:26.280\nKnock it off.\n\n01:19:26.280 --> 01:19:28.280\nThe poor guy.\n\n01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:30.280\nHis only crime is being so visible.\n\n01:19:30.280 --> 01:19:31.280\nWait, why?\n\n01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:35.280\nI think it's such a cool thing that I like to hear the way that he...\n\n01:19:35.280 --> 01:19:37.280\nNo, but I'm saying what would he be?\n\n01:19:37.280 --> 01:19:38.280\nHe says like, Douchebag.\n\n01:19:38.280 --> 01:19:39.280\nOh, he's an asshole.\n\n01:19:39.280 --> 01:19:42.280\nYippee-ki-yay, mommy issues.\n\n01:19:42.280 --> 01:19:47.280\nI really like Hudson Hawk.\n\n01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:49.280\nI like Hudson Hawk.\n\n01:19:49.280 --> 01:19:50.280\nI like that movie.\n\n01:19:50.280 --> 01:19:52.280\nYou're the one.\n\n01:19:52.280 --> 01:19:54.280\nWhat would his Essences be?\n\n01:19:54.280 --> 01:19:57.280\nHey, uh...\n\n01:19:57.280 --> 01:20:00.280\nCall of fucking California.\n\n01:20:00.280 --> 01:20:04.280\nAll things considered, rather being Philadelphia.\n\n01:20:04.280 --> 01:20:11.280\nHis Essences would be along the lines of some of the things that he'd be like, hey, oh,\n\n01:20:11.280 --> 01:20:13.280\nwhat are you doing over here?\n\n01:20:13.280 --> 01:20:15.280\nIt's me, Bruce Willis.\n\n01:20:15.280 --> 01:20:17.280\nThat's not an Essence.\n\n01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:23.280\nOh, look, what's going on over here?\n\n01:20:23.280 --> 01:20:25.280\nI'm trying to...\n\n01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:26.280\nI'm coming up with it.\n\n01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:28.280\nBruce Willis' Essence.\n\n01:20:28.280 --> 01:20:33.280\nOh, hey.\n\n01:20:33.280 --> 01:20:36.280\nSam Christensen is turning in his grave right now.\n\n01:20:36.280 --> 01:20:38.280\nSam's like, you can do it, Dan.\n\n01:20:38.280 --> 01:20:39.280\nYou can do it.\n\n01:20:39.280 --> 01:20:40.280\nI'm going to come up with it.\n\n01:20:40.280 --> 01:20:43.280\nThis is Bruce Willis' top Essence.\n\n01:20:43.280 --> 01:20:49.280\nHey, you put a plant in a pot?\n\n01:20:49.280 --> 01:20:52.280\nYou get a potted plant?\n\n01:20:52.280 --> 01:20:53.280\nThat's pretty good.\n\n01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:54.280\nPretty good.\n\n01:20:54.280 --> 01:20:56.280\nTell me I'm fucking wrong.\n\n01:20:56.280 --> 01:20:58.280\nYou put a pot in a plant.\n\n01:20:58.280 --> 01:21:00.280\nYou get a potted plant.\n\n01:21:00.280 --> 01:21:02.280\nWhat Essence is that, though?\n\n01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:03.280\nThat's Bruce Willis' Essence.\n\n01:21:03.280 --> 01:21:05.280\nWhat do you mean, what Essence is that?\n\n01:21:05.280 --> 01:21:09.280\nWhat are you describing about him?\n\n01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:12.280\nHey, you put a pot in a plant?\n\n01:21:12.280 --> 01:21:13.280\nA plant in a pot.\n\n01:21:13.280 --> 01:21:14.280\nSorry, I fucked it up.\n\n01:21:14.280 --> 01:21:16.280\nYou put a plant...\n\n01:21:16.280 --> 01:21:17.280\nIt's about...\n\n01:21:17.280 --> 01:21:18.280\nIt's for him.\n\n01:21:18.280 --> 01:21:19.280\nIt's not for you.\n\n01:21:19.280 --> 01:21:22.280\nIt's how he centers himself before an audition,\n\n01:21:22.280 --> 01:21:23.280\nwhich he doesn't have to do anymore\n\n01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:25.280\nbecause he fucking figured it out.\n\n01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:27.280\nSorry, he slapped you.\n\n01:21:27.280 --> 01:21:29.280\nThat's not cool.\n\n01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:31.280\nPeople shouldn't slap people.\n\n01:21:31.280 --> 01:21:32.280\nI'm confused.\n\n01:21:32.280 --> 01:21:34.280\nIn the 80s, everyone was slapping everybody.\n\n01:21:34.280 --> 01:21:36.280\nA lot of people were drugged.\n\n01:21:36.280 --> 01:21:38.280\nI mean, there were nine people in the world\n\n01:21:38.280 --> 01:21:39.280\nand he was one of them.\n\n01:21:39.280 --> 01:21:40.280\nSo it's like, what do I do?\n\n01:21:40.280 --> 01:21:41.280\nHe was drugged, man.\n\n01:21:41.280 --> 01:21:42.280\nOne of the nine people slapped me.\n\n01:21:42.280 --> 01:21:43.280\nHe was angry.\n\n01:21:43.280 --> 01:21:45.280\nThis is the problem I have with this story.\n\n01:21:45.280 --> 01:21:48.280\nSo you're pulling into the improv.\n\n01:21:48.280 --> 01:21:49.280\nOh, my God.\n\n01:21:49.280 --> 01:21:51.280\nJust listen to me.\n\n01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:53.280\nYou're pulling into the improv.\n\n01:21:53.280 --> 01:21:54.280\nI'm going to slap you.\n\n01:21:54.280 --> 01:21:56.280\nAnd then Bruce Willis says,\n\n01:21:56.280 --> 01:21:58.280\nhey, where are you going?\n\n01:21:58.280 --> 01:22:00.280\nYou're pulling into the improv.\n\n01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:01.280\nAlbert!\n\n01:22:01.280 --> 01:22:03.280\nWas he wearing a vest?\n\n01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:04.280\nDid he have flashlights?\n\n01:22:04.280 --> 01:22:05.280\nHey, where are you going?\n\n01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:06.280\nMaybe...\n\n01:22:06.280 --> 01:22:08.280\nI mean, there's a sign...\n\n01:22:08.280 --> 01:22:10.280\nBecause if the answer is the improv,\n\n01:22:10.280 --> 01:22:11.280\nyou get validated.\n\n01:22:11.280 --> 01:22:12.280\nYou're pulling into the improv.\n\n01:22:12.280 --> 01:22:13.280\nI think what it meant is that\n\n01:22:13.280 --> 01:22:14.280\nhey, where are you going?\n\n01:22:14.280 --> 01:22:15.280\nHey, where are you going?\n\n01:22:15.280 --> 01:22:16.280\nWe're not going anywhere.\n\n01:22:16.280 --> 01:22:19.280\nYou just see that part of the story trick me up too.\n\n01:22:19.280 --> 01:22:20.280\nI know what you are,\n\n01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:22.280\nbut I'm saying he was probably saying like,\n\n01:22:22.280 --> 01:22:23.280\nhey, where are you going?\n\n01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:25.280\nOkay, I know what his technique was,\n\n01:22:25.280 --> 01:22:26.280\nbecause it was the improv.\n\n01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:28.280\nOkay, you be Cody's mom.\n\n01:22:28.280 --> 01:22:29.280\nI'll be Bruce Willis.\n\n01:22:29.280 --> 01:22:30.280\nOkay.\n\n01:22:30.280 --> 01:22:31.280\nOkay, so...\n\n01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:34.280\nHey, where are you going?\n\n01:22:34.280 --> 01:22:37.280\nOh, it's there.\n\n01:22:37.280 --> 01:22:38.280\nWhat?\n\n01:22:38.280 --> 01:22:39.280\nFor the listeners,\n\n01:22:39.280 --> 01:22:40.280\nfor our listeners,\n\n01:22:40.280 --> 01:22:43.280\nthat was Robert rolling down a window.\n\n01:22:43.280 --> 01:22:45.280\nCast your minds back\n\n01:22:45.280 --> 01:22:47.280\ninto the foggy mist of time.\n\n01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:49.280\nA Jimmy Carter-era window got rolled down.\n\n01:22:49.280 --> 01:22:52.280\nDo you see how long the crank was?\n\n01:22:52.280 --> 01:22:53.280\nJump of the night.\n\n01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:54.280\nThe radius.\n\n01:22:54.280 --> 01:22:57.280\nBecause apparently she was...\n\n01:22:57.280 --> 01:23:01.280\nShe was in an Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme.\n\n01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:05.280\nShe was also the size of a mouse.\n\n01:23:05.280 --> 01:23:07.280\nAll right, sorry.\n\n01:23:07.280 --> 01:23:10.280\nHey, where are you going?\n\n01:23:10.280 --> 01:23:11.280\nWe just got here.\n\n01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:12.280\nWe're going nowhere.\n\n01:23:12.280 --> 01:23:14.280\nWhere are you going?\n\n01:23:14.280 --> 01:23:16.280\nThe improv.\n\n01:23:16.280 --> 01:23:18.280\nHey, you like improv?\n\n01:23:18.280 --> 01:23:20.280\nYeah, we're going here.\n\n01:23:20.280 --> 01:23:22.280\nSo you can't deny.\n\n01:23:22.280 --> 01:23:23.280\nYou can't ask questions.\n\n01:23:23.280 --> 01:23:24.280\nNope.\n\n01:23:24.280 --> 01:23:26.280\nDoes this suck my dick?\n\n01:23:26.280 --> 01:23:28.280\nYes, and...\n\n01:23:28.280 --> 01:23:29.280\nWhat?\n\n01:23:29.280 --> 01:23:31.280\nOh, she's rolling up the window.\n\n01:23:31.280 --> 01:23:32.280\nI was just saying, like, he...\n\n01:23:32.280 --> 01:23:37.280\nYou can't go fuck yourself.\n\n01:23:37.280 --> 01:23:39.280\nMy point was, what the...\n\n01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:40.280\nIn the fuck...\n\n01:23:40.280 --> 01:23:42.280\nAll right, tonight's show's...\n\n01:23:42.280 --> 01:23:47.280\nThat he picked that spot because it was, like, a thing.\n\n01:23:47.280 --> 01:23:49.280\nLike, he's like, where are you going?\n\n01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:51.280\nYour answer's supposed to be, I'm going to the improv.\n\n01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:52.280\nAnd he's like...\n\n01:23:52.280 --> 01:23:54.280\nWe weren't going into the improv.\n\n01:23:54.280 --> 01:23:55.280\nIf you want to improvise...\n\n01:23:55.280 --> 01:23:56.280\nWhere are you going?\n\n01:23:56.280 --> 01:23:57.280\nBruce Willis.\n\n01:23:57.280 --> 01:23:58.280\nWhere were you going?\n\n01:23:58.280 --> 01:23:59.280\nThat's what I asked before.\n\n01:23:59.280 --> 01:24:00.280\nI don't know.\n\n01:24:00.280 --> 01:24:01.280\nI don't remember.\n\n01:24:01.280 --> 01:24:02.280\nShe was going to the improv.\n\n01:24:02.280 --> 01:24:03.280\nNo, we weren't.\n\n01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:04.280\nShe's going to the laugh factory.\n\n01:24:04.280 --> 01:24:05.280\nWhere were we going?\n\n01:24:05.280 --> 01:24:06.280\nI don't remember.\n\n01:24:06.280 --> 01:24:07.280\nI'm just...\n\n01:24:07.280 --> 01:24:08.280\nYou know what?\n\n01:24:08.280 --> 01:24:10.280\nWe may not have been in the front of the improv.\n\n01:24:10.280 --> 01:24:11.280\nOh, my God.\n\n01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:12.280\nNow that I think about it...\n\n01:24:12.280 --> 01:24:13.280\nWe never.\n\n01:24:13.280 --> 01:24:17.280\nI'm just saying it was somewhere where we were pulled up for a show.\n\n01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:18.280\nI don't know.\n\n01:24:18.280 --> 01:24:19.280\nI don't remember.\n\n01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:21.280\nThe story's falling apart, right?\n\n01:24:21.280 --> 01:24:22.280\nThis was not even Bruce Willis' life.\n\n01:24:22.280 --> 01:24:24.280\nHe probably pulled up to Bruce Willis' house.\n\n01:24:24.280 --> 01:24:26.280\nWe probably pulled up to Bruce Willis' house.\n\n01:24:26.280 --> 01:24:27.280\nI pulled up to Bruce Willis' house.\n\n01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:28.280\nI'm going to call...\n\n01:24:30.280 --> 01:24:32.280\nYou were trespassing.\n\n01:24:32.280 --> 01:24:36.280\nYou were stealing his diehard gargoyles.\n\n01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:37.280\nHey, what are you doing?\n\n01:24:37.280 --> 01:24:38.280\nWhere are you?\n\n01:24:38.280 --> 01:24:41.280\nI had those built because I'm proud of being a diehard.\n\n01:24:41.280 --> 01:24:44.280\nYou're like, I don't fucking know.\n\n01:24:44.280 --> 01:24:47.280\nHe tried to grab them and he slapped you.\n\n01:24:47.280 --> 01:24:50.280\nWhat the fuck are you doing?\n\n01:24:50.280 --> 01:24:52.280\nI got two things I like.\n\n01:24:52.280 --> 01:24:55.280\nMy gargoyles in my diehard mailbox.\n\n01:24:55.280 --> 01:24:58.280\nNow the truth comes out.\n\n01:24:58.280 --> 01:24:59.280\nAll right.\n\n01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:00.280\nMama LaRusso, the character.\n\n01:25:00.280 --> 01:25:01.280\nLet's dig in.\n\n01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:02.280\nDig in.\n\n01:25:02.280 --> 01:25:04.280\nIs she Italian or Jewish?\n\n01:25:04.280 --> 01:25:05.280\nYeah.\n\n01:25:05.280 --> 01:25:08.280\nYou got to eat the mic.\n\n01:25:08.280 --> 01:25:09.280\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:25:09.280 --> 01:25:10.280\nThe name LaRusso...\n\n01:25:10.280 --> 01:25:11.280\nThe LaRusso family is very Italian.\n\n01:25:11.280 --> 01:25:12.280\nThey were Italian.\n\n01:25:12.280 --> 01:25:13.280\nThey were New Jersey Italians.\n\n01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:14.280\nAnd you're like, where were they from?\n\n01:25:14.280 --> 01:25:15.280\nRecita?\n\n01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:16.280\nWhat does she say?\n\n01:25:16.280 --> 01:25:17.280\nNo, no, no, Jersey.\n\n01:25:17.280 --> 01:25:18.280\nJersey.\n\n01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:19.280\nYeah.\n\n01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:20.280\nAnd they were in Recita, California.\n\n01:25:20.280 --> 01:25:21.280\nWell, they were visiting.\n\n01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:22.280\nThey were coming, not visiting.\n\n01:25:22.280 --> 01:25:24.280\nThey were moving to Los Angeles.\n\n01:25:24.280 --> 01:25:28.280\nAnd they pulled up in Recita to a place that they were going to live.\n\n01:25:28.280 --> 01:25:30.280\nTell me about Elizabeth Shoe.\n\n01:25:30.280 --> 01:25:32.280\nCute, young.\n\n01:25:32.280 --> 01:25:34.280\nShe was like 18, first job.\n\n01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:36.280\nHow old was Ralph Machio?\n\n01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:38.280\nRalph was about 22.\n\n01:25:38.280 --> 01:25:39.280\nWhat?\n\n01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:40.280\nNo shit.\n\n01:25:40.280 --> 01:25:41.280\nNo way.\n\n01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:42.280\nThat was so fucking weird.\n\n01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:43.280\nHe looked like a 14-year-old.\n\n01:25:43.280 --> 01:25:44.280\nHollywood Light!\n\n01:25:44.280 --> 01:25:46.280\nThat is so weird.\n\n01:25:46.280 --> 01:25:51.280\nI mean, first of all, to props to Machio, we're not age-shaming him.\n\n01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:54.280\nI would have assumed absolutely the opposite.\n\n01:25:54.280 --> 01:25:55.280\nNo shame to Elizabeth.\n\n01:25:55.280 --> 01:25:59.280\nBecause when you watch that movie through nowadays' eyes, you're like, oh, Jesus Christ.\n\n01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:04.280\nThere were so few people in the world that we always had to cast adults as teenagers.\n\n01:26:04.280 --> 01:26:11.280\nAnd Elizabeth Shoe is gorgeous, but she very much feels like she's his mom.\n\n01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:13.280\nShe was very mature.\n\n01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:15.280\nShe feels like a grown-ass woman.\n\n01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:17.280\nHe looked like his hormones had kicked in.\n\n01:26:17.280 --> 01:26:19.280\nVery convincingly, like 14.\n\n01:26:19.280 --> 01:26:20.280\nHe was 22?\n\n01:26:20.280 --> 01:26:21.280\nHe was 16.\n\n01:26:21.280 --> 01:26:23.280\nI mean, 22 playing 16.\n\n01:26:23.280 --> 01:26:24.280\nWow.\n\n01:26:24.280 --> 01:26:28.280\nAnd when I got hired, I had to audition with him.\n\n01:26:28.280 --> 01:26:32.280\nAnd I walked out and I said, God, I'm only 36.\n\n01:26:32.280 --> 01:26:34.280\nAnd he's 22.\n\n01:26:34.280 --> 01:26:37.280\nBecause he looked so young.\n\n01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:39.280\nOh, did you feel like, yeah.\n\n01:26:39.280 --> 01:26:44.280\nSo you get the call or your agent goes, got a part.\n\n01:26:44.280 --> 01:26:47.280\nThe name of the part is Mama LaRusso.\n\n01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:52.280\nWas there ever, as a female actor, you have to go through.\n\n01:26:52.280 --> 01:26:55.280\nI've dated an actor or two here and there.\n\n01:26:55.280 --> 01:26:56.280\nOh, really?\n\n01:26:56.280 --> 01:27:05.280\nI've experienced some existential crises where the actor goes, what the fuck?\n\n01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:12.280\nAnd they're like, why am I getting, why is my agent telling me to audition for this soccer mom and this Ford commercial?\n\n01:27:12.280 --> 01:27:13.280\nOh, oh, oh.\n\n01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:15.280\nWas there a line where you?\n\n01:27:15.280 --> 01:27:17.280\nNo, I was just happy to work.\n\n01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:21.280\nYou know, I came to LA and that was one of my first jobs.\n\n01:27:21.280 --> 01:27:23.280\nI wasn't even thinking about it.\n\n01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:26.280\nI was just that he looked so young.\n\n01:27:26.280 --> 01:27:28.280\nAnd when I found out he was 22 and I was only 36.\n\n01:27:28.280 --> 01:27:32.280\nSo I think, I mean, in the script, I don't think it was Mama LaRusso.\n\n01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:33.280\nNo.\n\n01:27:33.280 --> 01:27:34.280\nI just want to, I feel like.\n\n01:27:34.280 --> 01:27:35.280\nWhat was the character's first name?\n\n01:27:35.280 --> 01:27:36.280\nI don't know.\n\n01:27:36.280 --> 01:27:37.280\nBut I read it.\n\n01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:39.280\nI thought it was like such a little gem even when I first read it.\n\n01:27:39.280 --> 01:27:41.280\nYou recognized that it was satisfying.\n\n01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:43.280\nOh, I didn't think it was going to become like it did.\n\n01:27:43.280 --> 01:27:49.280\nBut I said, wow, that's a beautiful story, you know, and great part for an Asian man.\n\n01:27:49.280 --> 01:27:54.280\nPat Merida was only 17 in that.\n\n01:27:54.280 --> 01:27:55.280\nIt's just super.\n\n01:27:55.280 --> 01:27:58.280\nI did this podcast on Whiting Wags with Jessica Gow.\n\n01:27:58.280 --> 01:28:03.280\nLike we, like it's weird, like millennials don't.\n\n01:28:03.280 --> 01:28:06.280\nPat Merida wanted, did he win an Oscar for that?\n\n01:28:06.280 --> 01:28:07.280\nNo, but he was nominated.\n\n01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:08.280\nHe's nominated.\n\n01:28:08.280 --> 01:28:13.280\nLike try to imagine a world where Pat Merida, who speaks like you and I, he was.\n\n01:28:13.280 --> 01:28:14.280\nNot anymore.\n\n01:28:14.280 --> 01:28:16.280\nHe was, well, not anymore.\n\n01:28:16.280 --> 01:28:19.280\nThat's a ghoulish.\n\n01:28:19.280 --> 01:28:21.280\nYou said I was like the devil.\n\n01:28:21.280 --> 01:28:28.280\nSo he has a, like, and then he's playing this guy.\n\n01:28:28.280 --> 01:28:31.280\nHe's cast for the shape of his face for his lineage or whatever.\n\n01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:35.280\nAnd he's like our confusing relationship with whitewashing and all this stuff.\n\n01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:43.280\nAnd like Pat Merida was nominated for an Oscar because he played a Japanese national immigrant.\n\n01:28:43.280 --> 01:28:48.280\nAnd he talked like this, Daniel's son.\n\n01:28:48.280 --> 01:28:56.280\nAnd in the midst of talking like this, which is one genealogy branch from being Mickey Rourke\n\n01:28:56.280 --> 01:28:59.280\nin Breakfast at Tiffany's, but he's Japanese.\n\n01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:00.280\nHe's Asian.\n\n01:29:00.280 --> 01:29:01.280\nMickey Rourke.\n\n01:29:01.280 --> 01:29:02.280\nMickey Rourke.\n\n01:29:02.280 --> 01:29:03.280\nWhat did I say?\n\n01:29:03.280 --> 01:29:04.280\nMickey Rourke.\n\n01:29:04.280 --> 01:29:05.280\nThat would have been good.\n\n01:29:05.280 --> 01:29:06.280\nFat check.\n\n01:29:06.280 --> 01:29:07.280\nI do that every day.\n\n01:29:07.280 --> 01:29:08.280\nFat check.\n\n01:29:08.280 --> 01:29:13.280\nThe modern lens was like, well, what are you doing there?\n\n01:29:13.280 --> 01:29:14.280\nYou're not supposed to do that.\n\n01:29:14.280 --> 01:29:16.280\nDo you think it was racist?\n\n01:29:16.280 --> 01:29:23.280\nWell, I'm 46, so I was socialized not to, but like through a modern lens, you're supposed\n\n01:29:23.280 --> 01:29:28.520\nto go, oh, this is everything that's wrong with everything because it's like, well, it's\n\n01:29:28.520 --> 01:29:34.280\nvery, very confusing when it comes to casting, like this idea of, oh, why did you cast this\n\n01:29:34.280 --> 01:29:39.880\nwhite person as this blah, blah, blah, when you could have cast this person, like it's,\n\n01:29:39.880 --> 01:29:44.800\nyour brain kind of understands it to a certain point, but it gets a little confusing between\n\n01:29:44.800 --> 01:29:51.560\ngenerations because there was, I remember at that time, there was absolutely, there was\n\n01:29:51.560 --> 01:29:59.240\nno question of whether or not Pat Merida was very deserving of accolades for being on screen\n\n01:29:59.240 --> 01:30:05.960\ngoing, oh, Daniel, son, you should have do karate more better, oh, you do it this way,\n\n01:30:05.960 --> 01:30:06.960\ninstead of that way.\n\n01:30:06.960 --> 01:30:12.480\nAnd then, and I'm not knocking his, because the whole point is he acted the shit out of\n\n01:30:12.480 --> 01:30:13.480\nit.\n\n01:30:13.480 --> 01:30:14.920\nHe was doing a thick, weird accent.\n\n01:30:14.920 --> 01:30:17.240\nHe was a stereotype.\n\n01:30:17.240 --> 01:30:21.560\nAnd it was, it put you in the shoes of this kid who's like, the weird handyman is like,\n\n01:30:21.560 --> 01:30:25.440\nhey, what's a, what are you, well, I'm Brooklyn, I don't know what nothing about nothing, and\n\n01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:31.360\nI went back to Jersey, all I do is do this, and he's like, oh, Daniel, son, yeah, you\n\n01:30:31.360 --> 01:30:35.320\nfix a sink, but you know, fix a soul.\n\n01:30:35.320 --> 01:30:40.800\nAnd it's like, the whole thing had this like chemistry to it, it was like, very charismatic\n\n01:30:40.800 --> 01:30:43.640\nand I don't know, why am I bringing this up?\n\n01:30:43.640 --> 01:30:44.640\nI don't know.\n\n01:30:44.640 --> 01:30:45.640\nNo fucking idea.\n\n01:30:45.640 --> 01:30:46.640\nPat Merida's dead now.\n\n01:30:46.640 --> 01:30:51.360\nPat Merida was nominated for an Oscar for that, like, I don't know.\n\n01:30:51.360 --> 01:30:57.720\nI guess one of the things it brings up is that they redid the Karate Kid, they did the\n\n01:30:57.720 --> 01:31:00.160\nseries and you were on that series.\n\n01:31:00.160 --> 01:31:01.160\nIt's on now, yeah.\n\n01:31:01.160 --> 01:31:05.480\nI haven't seen that, but what's the deal with the Karate Kid series?\n\n01:31:05.480 --> 01:31:11.360\nLike, isn't Ralph Machio's in it, but he's not like the good guy, right?\n\n01:31:11.360 --> 01:31:13.200\nWell, they're 56 years old now.\n\n01:31:13.200 --> 01:31:17.600\nHe's kind of like, isn't the series about kind of how he's sort of, is he straight a\n\n01:31:17.600 --> 01:31:22.040\nlittle bit in terms of values, he's not like a heroic innocent.\n\n01:31:22.040 --> 01:31:26.560\nHe's a karate kid, so now he's like drunk on power doing coke and I hear he, he beats\n\n01:31:26.560 --> 01:31:30.640\na few women in it and he's like, I'm waxing you on, I'm waxing you on.\n\n01:31:30.640 --> 01:31:32.040\nThat's a great series.\n\n01:31:32.040 --> 01:31:34.800\nBut the Cobra Kai are like sympathetic or whatever.\n\n01:31:34.800 --> 01:31:42.720\nNo, no, no, it's, they're grown now, the two men, you know, Lawrence, what's the main\n\n01:31:42.720 --> 01:31:43.720\nto the blonde guy?\n\n01:31:43.720 --> 01:31:44.720\nWhat's his name?\n\n01:31:44.720 --> 01:31:45.720\nBilly Zafka.\n\n01:31:45.720 --> 01:31:47.720\nWell, what's a character?\n\n01:31:47.720 --> 01:31:48.720\nJohnny, right?\n\n01:31:48.720 --> 01:31:49.720\nDo you watch it?\n\n01:31:49.720 --> 01:31:50.720\nWho is that?\n\n01:31:50.720 --> 01:31:51.720\nIs that my husband?\n\n01:31:51.720 --> 01:31:52.720\nThat's your, that's your husband.\n\n01:31:52.720 --> 01:31:53.720\nOh, that's my husband.\n\n01:31:53.720 --> 01:31:54.720\nI had the same reaction.\n\n01:31:54.720 --> 01:31:57.240\nI'm like, whoa, big Karate Kidman.\n\n01:31:57.240 --> 01:31:58.240\nIt's your husband.\n\n01:31:58.240 --> 01:31:59.240\nI can't even.\n\n01:31:59.240 --> 01:32:00.240\nHe read the call sheet.\n\n01:32:00.240 --> 01:32:01.240\nBilly Zafka.\n\n01:32:01.240 --> 01:32:02.240\nThank you.\n\n01:32:02.240 --> 01:32:03.240\nNot their rivals again.\n\n01:32:03.240 --> 01:32:04.240\nI had to run all his lines.\n\n01:32:04.240 --> 01:32:05.240\nHis favorite color is green.\n\n01:32:05.240 --> 01:32:06.240\nFor God's sakes.\n\n01:32:06.240 --> 01:32:07.240\nGet your shit together.\n\n01:32:07.240 --> 01:32:08.240\nYou put me in the car.\n\n01:32:08.240 --> 01:32:21.080\nThat's called Cobra Kai.\n\n01:32:21.080 --> 01:32:23.080\nIs everybody watching it?\n\n01:32:23.080 --> 01:32:24.080\nUh-oh.\n\n01:32:24.080 --> 01:32:29.840\nIt's doing really well.\n\n01:32:29.840 --> 01:32:33.840\nThe good news is that response means eight million people are watching it.\n\n01:32:33.840 --> 01:32:34.840\nThere's so much TV.\n\n01:32:34.840 --> 01:32:35.840\nIt's just aerosol misted.\n\n01:32:35.840 --> 01:32:36.840\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n01:32:36.840 --> 01:32:41.840\nAnybody watching Green River?\n\n01:32:41.840 --> 01:32:42.840\nNo.\n\n01:32:42.840 --> 01:32:43.840\nSee?\n\n01:32:43.840 --> 01:32:44.840\nYeah.\n\n01:32:44.840 --> 01:32:45.840\nA million people watching it.\n\n01:32:45.840 --> 01:32:48.800\nAnd that's a show I made up.\n\n01:32:48.800 --> 01:32:53.600\nNo, they're rivals again, and they're grown up now.\n\n01:32:53.600 --> 01:32:58.080\nAnd Billy Zaptis character has a dojo.\n\n01:32:58.080 --> 01:33:00.880\nAnd oh, it's so hard to explain.\n\n01:33:00.880 --> 01:33:01.960\nYou don't have to.\n\n01:33:01.960 --> 01:33:03.520\nBut they're rivals now again.\n\n01:33:03.520 --> 01:33:04.520\nNot going to watch it.\n\n01:33:04.520 --> 01:33:05.520\nYeah.\n\n01:33:05.520 --> 01:33:08.520\nWe've reached the part of the show where I'm so drunk.\n\n01:33:08.520 --> 01:33:12.120\nThey actually did a great job bringing it into today's world.\n\n01:33:12.120 --> 01:33:15.160\nJust wrap you across the face?\n\n01:33:15.160 --> 01:33:16.160\nYes.\n\n01:33:16.160 --> 01:33:19.640\nNo, it's good.\n\n01:33:19.640 --> 01:33:20.640\nI think it's good.\n\n01:33:20.640 --> 01:33:21.640\nYeah.\n\n01:33:21.640 --> 01:33:23.240\nAll right, give us some John Hamm stories.\n\n01:33:23.240 --> 01:33:26.200\nYou were on Mad Men.\n\n01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:28.840\nWhat does this dick look like?\n\n01:33:28.840 --> 01:33:30.520\nI heard it's very large.\n\n01:33:30.520 --> 01:33:33.200\nJohn, I hope he's not listening to this.\n\n01:33:33.200 --> 01:33:34.200\nHe probably is.\n\n01:33:34.200 --> 01:33:35.720\nYou know what?\n\n01:33:35.720 --> 01:33:36.720\nBig deal.\n\n01:33:36.720 --> 01:33:37.720\nI don't know about it.\n\n01:33:37.720 --> 01:33:38.720\nOh, John, sorry.\n\n01:33:38.720 --> 01:33:42.480\nWe're spreading the rumor about your big giant dick again.\n\n01:33:42.480 --> 01:33:46.200\nBut here's a thousand dick-shaped violins playing for his giant dick.\n\n01:33:46.200 --> 01:33:49.400\nNo, because everyone knows about it, because there are pictures and stuff.\n\n01:33:49.400 --> 01:33:51.880\nHe's a tell-the-wigs story.\n\n01:33:51.880 --> 01:33:53.600\nOh, you tell it.\n\n01:33:53.600 --> 01:33:54.600\nTell it.\n\n01:33:54.600 --> 01:33:55.600\nHe's a good at this.\n\n01:33:55.600 --> 01:33:59.240\nSo Randy's having a four-hour makeup done to age her.\n\n01:33:59.240 --> 01:34:03.240\nAnd the makeup lady says to her, maybe I'm making up half the spirits, but it's fine.\n\n01:34:03.240 --> 01:34:07.600\nSo the makeup says, I heard Matthew Wainer say...\n\n01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:10.760\nNo, it's wrong already.\n\n01:34:10.760 --> 01:34:15.800\nNo, so my character has this big wig and aging.\n\n01:34:15.800 --> 01:34:17.760\nThey age me up.\n\n01:34:17.760 --> 01:34:24.360\nAnd there was a scene where I was wearing the wig and I had to...\n\n01:34:24.360 --> 01:34:25.360\nOh, I tilted it.\n\n01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:26.960\nOh, this is going to be terrible.\n\n01:34:26.960 --> 01:34:27.960\nI'm telling it already.\n\n01:34:27.960 --> 01:34:28.960\nI felt it better.\n\n01:34:28.960 --> 01:34:29.960\nYeah, it's canceled.\n\n01:34:29.960 --> 01:34:30.960\nIt's canceled.\n\n01:34:30.960 --> 01:34:35.200\nSo the wig person says, I heard Matthew Wainer said, it might be funny if you adjusted your\n\n01:34:35.200 --> 01:34:37.040\nwig in the scene.\n\n01:34:37.040 --> 01:34:39.040\nSo she said, oh, well, I think I'll do that then.\n\n01:34:39.040 --> 01:34:42.320\nSo she gets to the first take and she adjusts the wig.\n\n01:34:42.320 --> 01:34:45.320\nAnd then they do the second take and she adjusts the wig.\n\n01:34:45.320 --> 01:34:47.400\nAnd she said to John, John, too much?\n\n01:34:47.400 --> 01:34:50.800\nShe said, first take, yeah, second take, no.\n\n01:34:50.800 --> 01:34:51.800\nThat was what happened.\n\n01:34:51.800 --> 01:34:52.800\nSee?\n\n01:34:52.800 --> 01:34:53.800\nI don't really...\n\n01:34:53.800 --> 01:34:54.800\nI don't really...\n\n01:34:54.800 --> 01:34:56.280\nI have any John Hamm stories.\n\n01:34:56.280 --> 01:34:58.080\nIt was great to work on that show.\n\n01:34:58.080 --> 01:34:59.080\nI had a great time.\n\n01:34:59.080 --> 01:35:00.080\nHe's a good guy.\n\n01:35:00.080 --> 01:35:01.080\nHe's a huge dick.\n\n01:35:01.080 --> 01:35:02.080\nAnd he's beautiful.\n\n01:35:02.080 --> 01:35:03.080\nAnd he is a big dick.\n\n01:35:03.080 --> 01:35:04.080\nNo, I don't.\n\n01:35:04.080 --> 01:35:07.080\nIn my experience, it's big, but it's weird.\n\n01:35:07.080 --> 01:35:08.080\nYeah.\n\n01:35:08.080 --> 01:35:09.080\nOh, really?\n\n01:35:09.080 --> 01:35:10.080\nIt's a big, weird dick.\n\n01:35:10.080 --> 01:35:11.080\nIt's shaped like an ampersand.\n\n01:35:11.080 --> 01:35:12.080\nLike a ham?\n\n01:35:12.080 --> 01:35:13.080\nLike a ham thing?\n\n01:35:13.080 --> 01:35:14.080\nLike Liam Neeson.\n\n01:35:14.080 --> 01:35:15.080\nLike a ham bone?\n\n01:35:15.080 --> 01:35:16.080\nHe has an ampersand dick.\n\n01:35:16.080 --> 01:35:17.080\nIt's just shaped like a...\n\n01:35:17.080 --> 01:35:18.080\nWe're going down the hill here.\n\n01:35:18.080 --> 01:35:19.080\nHis dick is like a treble cleft.\n\n01:35:19.080 --> 01:35:20.080\nYeah.\n\n01:35:20.080 --> 01:35:21.080\nIt's very curvilinear.\n\n01:35:21.080 --> 01:35:25.720\nAnd honestly, John Hamm, if you're listening or if any of your representatives are, come\n\n01:35:25.720 --> 01:35:26.720\non the show.\n\n01:35:26.720 --> 01:35:27.720\nClear your name.\n\n01:35:27.720 --> 01:35:28.720\nThat's right.\n\n01:35:28.720 --> 01:35:30.720\nI'm going to challenge John Hamm to come on the show.\n\n01:35:30.720 --> 01:35:33.720\nShow us your dick.\n\n01:35:33.720 --> 01:35:34.720\nTake out a little bit to win.\n\n01:35:34.720 --> 01:35:42.640\nLet's get Bruce Willis and John Hamm, and we'll have Bruce slap John Hamm's dick.\n\n01:35:42.640 --> 01:35:43.640\nI still...\n\n01:35:43.640 --> 01:35:44.640\nSuch an exciting career.\n\n01:35:44.640 --> 01:35:45.640\nI feel like Sam.\n\n01:35:45.640 --> 01:35:46.640\nSam is watching.\n\n01:35:46.640 --> 01:35:48.640\nHe's still like, you guys didn't do it yet.\n\n01:35:48.640 --> 01:35:51.000\nYou didn't do that thing that I need you to do.\n\n01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000\nI didn't go to his class.\n\n01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.080\nI should have gone.\n\n01:35:55.080 --> 01:35:56.680\nHe needs us to be true to ourselves.\n\n01:35:56.680 --> 01:35:57.680\nSam wants me.\n\n01:35:57.680 --> 01:35:58.880\nSam was always like...\n\n01:35:58.880 --> 01:36:03.920\nI feel like when I went to Sam's class, the thing that Sam was always suggesting to me\n\n01:36:03.920 --> 01:36:07.200\nthat I wish that he wasn't gone so that I could...\n\n01:36:07.200 --> 01:36:09.560\nI feel like I was incomplete.\n\n01:36:09.560 --> 01:36:13.520\nSam was always saying to me, okay, Dan, but why don't you do that?\n\n01:36:13.520 --> 01:36:18.080\nBut what if you weren't allowed to scream?\n\n01:36:18.080 --> 01:36:25.400\nBecause I thought not being a very good actor, when I learned how to yell, I was like, oh,\n\n01:36:25.400 --> 01:36:26.400\nthis is great acting.\n\n01:36:26.400 --> 01:36:30.920\nYou're telling me, speak the speech, I pray to you, tripping like I'm telling you.\n\n01:36:30.920 --> 01:36:32.440\nLike, oh, I'm yelling.\n\n01:36:32.440 --> 01:36:38.520\nAnd then Sam's thing was always like, okay, Dan, but what if you were afraid to do that?\n\n01:36:38.520 --> 01:36:40.480\nWhat if you had to sit on your rage?\n\n01:36:40.480 --> 01:36:42.080\nHow would that manifest itself?\n\n01:36:42.080 --> 01:36:44.120\nAnd I was never able to do that.\n\n01:36:44.120 --> 01:36:55.040\nAll of my stuff was like how wounded I was and how dishonestly that would manifest itself.\n\n01:36:55.040 --> 01:37:04.840\nAnd I never got to, I don't know, yeah, I don't know, my memories of Sam, they're incomplete\n\n01:37:04.840 --> 01:37:11.920\nbecause they make me go, Sam, give me more attention, tell me I did something, tell me...\n\n01:37:11.920 --> 01:37:16.760\nI weirdly pictured Sam when I was 70 that Sam would still be...\n\n01:37:16.760 --> 01:37:19.600\nI never thought about him as having an age or immortality.\n\n01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:24.920\nI thought he'd be like hanging out and he'd be like, you did it, good job, you're 70.\n\n01:37:24.920 --> 01:37:30.680\nYou did a great job at that eulogy, you did it.\n\n01:37:30.680 --> 01:37:34.640\nI was watching you on that...\n\n01:37:34.640 --> 01:37:41.320\nThere's so many things that he said, just with one line, with one little statement that completely\n\n01:37:41.320 --> 01:37:44.160\ntransformed the way I thought about things.\n\n01:37:44.160 --> 01:37:50.200\nAnd he told me one thing that I'll never forget, he said, Jeff, he goes, you make it all too\n\n01:37:50.200 --> 01:37:51.200\nhard.\n\n01:37:51.200 --> 01:37:55.280\nHe goes, you overthink it, you're making it harder than it is.\n\n01:37:55.280 --> 01:37:58.880\nHe goes, just do it, just say the words.\n\n01:37:58.880 --> 01:38:01.440\nHe goes, you have tricks that you use.\n\n01:38:01.440 --> 01:38:06.240\nHe goes, don't use them, just say the words.\n\n01:38:06.240 --> 01:38:09.400\nHe goes, do it again and just say it.\n\n01:38:09.400 --> 01:38:14.840\nAnd then all the emotion comes out when you're not lying and you're not pretending.\n\n01:38:14.840 --> 01:38:20.560\nHe just had a way of terrifying you into honesty, but without being terrifying, he never...\n\n01:38:20.560 --> 01:38:28.080\nAlso, he said, when I first took his class, I sat down and he told a story.\n\n01:38:28.080 --> 01:38:32.720\nThere was a girl that was in the class and it was the first day and he brought her down\n\n01:38:32.720 --> 01:38:36.800\nin the same way that he brought, when you first start the class, he'd just bring random person\n\n01:38:36.800 --> 01:38:43.000\nout of 15 of us, sit in the chair and he would just say, there was this woman that sat in\n\n01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:48.000\nthe chair, you're probably a 20-year-old girl, said, raise your hand the rest of you\n\n01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:55.440\nif you think that she is the first one in the pool and the last one out and nobody raised\n\n01:38:55.440 --> 01:38:57.040\ntheir hands.\n\n01:38:57.040 --> 01:39:02.760\nAnd he goes, raise your hand if you think that her bedroom is everything in its place\n\n01:39:02.760 --> 01:39:07.560\nand right where it should be and everybody raised their hand and she started crying.\n\n01:39:07.560 --> 01:39:11.600\nAnd Sam freaked because he's not there to make people cry, he's not one of those acting\n\n01:39:11.600 --> 01:39:16.080\nteachers that wants to break you down to build you back up, he's never like that.\n\n01:39:16.080 --> 01:39:18.000\nAnd he's like, oh, shit, why are you crying?\n\n01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:31.400\nAnd she goes, I'm an athlete, Olympic swimmer, I have three silver medals and nobody thinks\n\n01:39:31.400 --> 01:39:32.400\nI'm a swimmer.\n\n01:39:32.400 --> 01:39:36.800\nBut if you look at it, Sam was like, if you look at her, short hair, the shoulders, the\n\n01:39:36.800 --> 01:39:42.400\nbuild, the tan, she looks like a swimmer, but no, because why don't people perceive me\n\n01:39:42.400 --> 01:39:43.400\nas a swimmer?\n\n01:39:43.400 --> 01:39:44.400\nI've gone out on a thousand...\n\n01:39:44.400 --> 01:39:46.280\nYou're swimming, do I have to do?\n\n01:39:46.280 --> 01:39:47.280\nYeah.\n\n01:39:47.280 --> 01:39:51.240\nAnd she said to him, and she's crying, and she goes, I've gone on a thousand commercial\n\n01:39:51.240 --> 01:39:56.880\nauditions as an athlete, as a swimmer, and last year I went out and actually brought\n\n01:39:56.880 --> 01:40:00.400\none of my silver medals, which you're not supposed to do, you're not supposed to advertise\n\n01:40:00.400 --> 01:40:01.400\nthat.\n\n01:40:01.400 --> 01:40:03.440\nAnd I still couldn't get a call back on it.\n\n01:40:03.440 --> 01:40:04.880\nAnd he said, do you have an agent?\n\n01:40:04.880 --> 01:40:05.880\nAnd she says, yes.\n\n01:40:05.880 --> 01:40:11.600\nAnd she goes, Sam said, go to your agent tomorrow and say, no more athlete stuff, it's behind\n\n01:40:11.600 --> 01:40:14.880\nthe desk, everything in its place, everything just so.\n\n01:40:14.880 --> 01:40:18.640\nAnd he just met her.\n\n01:40:18.640 --> 01:40:22.840\nBehind the desk, everything in its place, everything just so.\n\n01:40:22.840 --> 01:40:26.880\nShe told her agents that, she booked three commercials that week.\n\n01:40:26.880 --> 01:40:33.120\nBecause he completely goes like, you're a swimmer, but we see you as something else.\n\n01:40:33.120 --> 01:40:36.600\nGoldie Hahn is an intellectual, but we want her to play an airhead.\n\n01:40:36.600 --> 01:40:37.600\nRight.\n\n01:40:37.600 --> 01:40:41.200\nBecause that's what she's bringing to the mythological table.\n\n01:40:41.200 --> 01:40:45.480\nThere was another story that fits in with that one, which I think it intersects with\n\n01:40:45.480 --> 01:40:49.280\nthe Pat Merida thing, which is in an area that's sort of confusing to me, like what's\n\n01:40:49.280 --> 01:40:54.000\nour job as actors and what's our job as producers and casting, that there was a woman in his\n\n01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:58.240\nclass that she was like, look, I feel like I want to be an actor.\n\n01:40:58.240 --> 01:41:02.400\nAnd I said, she takes the class, and she's doing the exercises, and she's getting flustered\n\n01:41:02.400 --> 01:41:06.080\nand more flustered, and something is eating away at her.\n\n01:41:06.080 --> 01:41:12.040\nIt's clear, and it builds and builds and builds, and then there's that class where she just\n\n01:41:12.040 --> 01:41:16.560\nsort of breaks down, and she starts, she just breaks down.\n\n01:41:16.560 --> 01:41:20.960\nAnd this is a story I heard third hand, and Sam goes, what's wrong?\n\n01:41:20.960 --> 01:41:21.960\nWhat's happening?\n\n01:41:21.960 --> 01:41:25.520\nAnd she goes, look, who are we fucking kidding?\n\n01:41:25.520 --> 01:41:27.920\nAnd then she described herself, and I can't remember the description.\n\n01:41:27.920 --> 01:41:38.760\nThe part of the story is, she's like, I'm a 280 pound, half Filipino, 45 year old woman,\n\n01:41:38.760 --> 01:41:42.800\nand I decided I want to be an actor, what the fuck am I doing?\n\n01:41:42.800 --> 01:41:47.680\nShe went on this rant that included like just this, her perceived evisceration of herself,\n\n01:41:47.680 --> 01:41:52.600\nwhich included just a functional cataloging of what she was.\n\n01:41:52.600 --> 01:42:00.320\nAnd Sam's response was, I want you to go home tonight, and I want you to take however many\n\n01:42:00.320 --> 01:42:05.200\nheadshots you have left, put them each in an envelope, and write, don't open this unless\n\n01:42:05.200 --> 01:42:11.320\nyou want a 45 year old half Filipino, blah, blah, blah, whatever she said, don't open\n\n01:42:11.320 --> 01:42:12.320\nit.\n\n01:42:12.320 --> 01:42:13.840\nDon't open it unless you want that.\n\n01:42:13.840 --> 01:42:17.520\nOn each of the envelopes, I want you to send it to all these people that you sent it to.\n\n01:42:17.520 --> 01:42:22.800\nAnd it was the, she was the receptionist on Northern Exposure, which millennials don't\n\n01:42:22.800 --> 01:42:23.800\nknow.\n\n01:42:23.800 --> 01:42:32.120\nThere was a shot, it was like, that was that actor that was like, you're looking, it was\n\n01:42:32.120 --> 01:42:39.360\njust sort of like, I don't know how to file that, it's this story of like, that's what\n\n01:42:39.360 --> 01:42:44.800\nSam's magic was, it's like, turn this thing that you think is an obstacle into this evil\n\n01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:50.000\ncarnival ramp and leap into the sky and have everyone look at you and notice these things.\n\n01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:55.800\nIt's almost counterintuitive to what we now profess politically and philosophically.\n\n01:42:55.800 --> 01:43:00.560\nThe things that we're trying to overcome is like, well, don't, you shouldn't be noticing\n\n01:43:00.560 --> 01:43:05.400\nthat I look like this, and your first instinct about who I am is actually your problem.\n\n01:43:05.400 --> 01:43:08.680\nYou should be actually finding your shame about it.\n\n01:43:08.680 --> 01:43:13.600\nAnd I don't know, I guess I always thought I would watch Sam grow and progress into that\n\n01:43:13.600 --> 01:43:17.640\nera and see how he reacted to it.\n\n01:43:17.640 --> 01:43:20.000\nI know that Sam was very internet averse.\n\n01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:24.960\nHe was always so, we would walk into class with our cell phones when they were first\n\n01:43:24.960 --> 01:43:30.320\ndeveloping at a palm tree and he's like, Dan, are you a, is that your phone?\n\n01:43:30.320 --> 01:43:36.080\nLike, yeah, he's like, did you know that that consumes three times as much energy as a refrigerator\n\n01:43:36.080 --> 01:43:37.080\nper week?\n\n01:43:37.080 --> 01:43:39.920\nWhat am I, okay, okay, sorry.\n\n01:43:39.920 --> 01:43:41.200\nClass isn't started yet.\n\n01:43:41.200 --> 01:43:48.480\nHe was like very, part of Sam to me always felt like he was, he was very sad to watch\n\n01:43:48.480 --> 01:43:50.680\nthe world progress.\n\n01:43:50.680 --> 01:43:54.680\nHe felt like it was becoming less and less human and stuff and I hate to beat a dead\n\n01:43:54.680 --> 01:44:04.040\nhorse, but I guess I'm going to Bob and saying, tell me, tell me he went away not going, oh,\n\n01:44:04.040 --> 01:44:06.480\nJesus Christ, you people are fucked up.\n\n01:44:06.480 --> 01:44:12.640\nThe thing about when you got your essences and then you have to go in front of the class\n\n01:44:12.640 --> 01:44:17.400\nand save them all and what's amazing is that everybody in the, you think they're either\n\n01:44:17.400 --> 01:44:22.160\ngoing to boo or cheer, but what they do is they just laugh and they go, oh, it's so cool\n\n01:44:22.160 --> 01:44:29.560\nthat that person knows, like there was a girl in my first class and she was just like really\n\n01:44:29.560 --> 01:44:37.360\nlike good looking like Latina and she hated one of her essences and it was Hot Tamale\n\n01:44:37.360 --> 01:44:40.160\nand she's like, I fucking hate this one.\n\n01:44:40.160 --> 01:44:41.160\nI fucking hate it.\n\n01:44:41.160 --> 01:44:42.160\nI hate it.\n\n01:44:42.160 --> 01:44:45.360\nWe're all dying laughing and he goes, why do you hate it?\n\n01:44:45.360 --> 01:44:51.360\nShe goes, because I've been called Hot Tamale my entire life and you always will be, but\n\n01:44:51.360 --> 01:44:55.440\nyou have to, like there's two stages.\n\n01:44:55.440 --> 01:44:59.240\nIt's acknowledging it and then embracing it and you have to throw your arms and go fuck\n\n01:44:59.240 --> 01:45:00.240\nit.\n\n01:45:00.240 --> 01:45:07.400\nI'm a Hot Tamale or Goldie Hahn has to embrace the fact that she's like America's airhead\n\n01:45:07.400 --> 01:45:14.400\neven though she's like a giant intellect and a church just sent me an awesome quote from\n\n01:45:14.400 --> 01:45:20.480\nNick Cave, embrace your flaws, they're the only thing of, they're the only thing of interest\n\n01:45:20.480 --> 01:45:27.240\nthat you have, like your flaws are what makes you and that's absolutely, like Sam would\n\n01:45:27.240 --> 01:45:32.920\nhave absolutely dug that because that's what he, he just had a way of like looking at\n\n01:45:32.920 --> 01:45:38.480\nyou and going, Jeff, someone said, hey, I sent someone to his class and I sent a million\n\n01:45:38.480 --> 01:45:42.920\npeople to his class and if you like spread it all out, my first girlfriend that sent\n\n01:45:42.920 --> 01:45:46.360\nme there, there must have been a thousand people that went there including like, you\n\n01:45:46.360 --> 01:45:55.600\nknow, you guys, a fuck, I've lost my train of thought, he had a way of just like, oh,\n\n01:45:55.600 --> 01:46:00.960\nso I said, I sent somebody to the class and my friend called me up and he goes, hey, Sam\n\n01:46:00.960 --> 01:46:08.120\nsays hi and he also said, tell Jeff he's an asshole and he'll get it.\n\n01:46:08.120 --> 01:46:13.840\nAnd I laughed because like, he's like, tell Jeff, you're an asshole and that's Sam going\n\n01:46:13.840 --> 01:46:17.760\nlike remind him that he should call me more.\n\n01:46:17.760 --> 01:46:24.840\nLike he only spoke to you in truth and absolutely essentially and it's the best.\n\n01:46:24.840 --> 01:46:31.040\nI feel like for me, Sam was the anchor of everything.\n\n01:46:31.040 --> 01:46:36.000\nWhen everything was going through your mind that you needed help with, that you needed\n\n01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:42.240\nadvice on, that you needed a perspective on that you had not thought of, he was the anchor.\n\n01:46:42.240 --> 01:46:47.600\nAnd what was interesting is I was with him when the night Obama was elected and I was\n\n01:46:47.600 --> 01:46:54.240\nwith him the night Trump was elected and on both nights he cried.\n\n01:46:54.240 --> 01:46:59.120\nFor the same reason, he's like, God, I'm so racist.\n\n01:46:59.120 --> 01:47:06.520\nNo, I can't remember, but I guess we haven't really addressed Sam's racism.\n\n01:47:06.520 --> 01:47:12.080\nSam seems like mentor, he's a screams mentor, even though he's a close friend of yours so\n\n01:47:12.080 --> 01:47:16.320\nyou're not going to like label him as a mentor because he's like your buddy, but at the same\n\n01:47:16.320 --> 01:47:20.760\ntime what you're saying is an anchor, he was there.\n\n01:47:20.760 --> 01:47:26.080\nDid that position, did that cause him pain?\n\n01:47:26.080 --> 01:47:28.640\nDid he, was he weary of that?\n\n01:47:28.640 --> 01:47:31.640\nDid he wish that there was like, yeah, I get it.\n\n01:47:31.640 --> 01:47:35.480\nEveryone wants to hear whether or not they need to feel good about themselves.\n\n01:47:35.480 --> 01:47:38.920\nJesus fucking Christ, is anyone going to ask me a goddamn question about what the fuck\n\n01:47:38.920 --> 01:47:39.920\nI want?\n\n01:47:39.920 --> 01:47:42.920\nIs that me projecting?\n\n01:47:42.920 --> 01:47:46.840\nNo, he lived in extreme back pain and stuff like that.\n\n01:47:46.840 --> 01:47:58.680\nLike I wonder if part of being so empathetic that you take on another, use your microphone.\n\n01:47:58.680 --> 01:47:59.680\nSorry.\n\n01:47:59.680 --> 01:48:01.240\nDo you think he embodied?\n\n01:48:01.240 --> 01:48:02.240\nI don't know.\n\n01:48:02.240 --> 01:48:07.160\nThat's something that Bob was very devoted teacher.\n\n01:48:07.160 --> 01:48:12.120\nI feel like if you're so good at spotting other people's pain that you have to wear\n\n01:48:12.120 --> 01:48:13.120\nthat pain.\n\n01:48:13.120 --> 01:48:14.120\nNo.\n\n01:48:14.120 --> 01:48:16.120\nLike you're an antenna for that kind of stuff.\n\n01:48:16.120 --> 01:48:17.120\nNo.\n\n01:48:17.120 --> 01:48:19.240\nI feel like it eased his pain.\n\n01:48:19.240 --> 01:48:22.560\nOther people's pain would ease his pain because he would solve it for them.\n\n01:48:22.560 --> 01:48:23.560\nHe was happy doing that.\n\n01:48:23.560 --> 01:48:24.680\nOh, he loved it.\n\n01:48:24.680 --> 01:48:26.280\nHe wasn't like invoicing it.\n\n01:48:26.280 --> 01:48:27.280\nNo.\n\n01:48:27.280 --> 01:48:28.280\nProject that under him.\n\n01:48:28.280 --> 01:48:30.080\nNo, because he's a teacher too.\n\n01:48:30.080 --> 01:48:35.240\nIt's interesting because years ago there was a televangelist named Teri Cole Whitaker\n\n01:48:35.240 --> 01:48:37.040\nwho I became friends with.\n\n01:48:37.040 --> 01:48:42.920\nAnd she was very successful and she sold DVDs and books and a book called What You Think\n\n01:48:42.920 --> 01:48:46.960\nof Me is None of My Business and all this stuff and everything.\n\n01:48:46.960 --> 01:48:47.960\nAnd finally she quit.\n\n01:48:47.960 --> 01:48:48.960\nAnd I said, I'm quitting.\n\n01:48:48.960 --> 01:48:49.960\nAnd I said, why are you quitting?\n\n01:48:49.960 --> 01:48:53.360\nShe said, because I feel like I'm everybody's crutch and I don't want to be everybody's\n\n01:48:53.360 --> 01:48:54.360\ncrutch.\n\n01:48:54.360 --> 01:48:55.360\nOkay.\n\n01:48:55.360 --> 01:48:56.360\nI want to live my life.\n\n01:48:56.360 --> 01:48:57.360\nSam did not feel like that.\n\n01:48:57.360 --> 01:48:58.360\nHe didn't feel like that.\n\n01:48:58.360 --> 01:48:59.360\nAnd he wasn't people's crutch.\n\n01:48:59.360 --> 01:49:03.000\nHe taught people and he had his own private life away from that.\n\n01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:08.960\nBut his relationship with me was not like, you know, I'm your crutch.\n\n01:49:08.960 --> 01:49:09.960\nIt was like...\n\n01:49:09.960 --> 01:49:10.960\nYour friends, dear.\n\n01:49:10.960 --> 01:49:15.680\nYour friends, but it was also give and take because I would advise him too.\n\n01:49:15.680 --> 01:49:16.680\nLike he...\n\n01:49:16.680 --> 01:49:19.920\nLet me throw something around you and see what you think of that.\n\n01:49:19.920 --> 01:49:25.240\nYou know, because we had interesting perspectives because we knew each other for so long, for\n\n01:49:25.240 --> 01:49:29.360\nso many years that we could be objective about each other.\n\n01:49:29.360 --> 01:49:30.360\nBut I think...\n\n01:49:30.360 --> 01:49:33.320\nWell, it's like a favorite thing of his on the off chance that we were to like, oh, we\n\n01:49:33.320 --> 01:49:34.320\ngot a podcast.\n\n01:49:34.320 --> 01:49:38.920\nLike what was a cause of Sam's like as far as charity going one way or another.\n\n01:49:38.920 --> 01:49:41.440\nWe have a new thing in the podcast where we're like divert things.\n\n01:49:41.440 --> 01:49:46.360\nDid Sam have a favorite actual like charity as far as like writing checks or it's like,\n\n01:49:46.360 --> 01:49:49.880\nyou know what I really love is puppies for poor people or whatever.\n\n01:49:49.880 --> 01:49:50.880\nDemocrats.\n\n01:49:50.880 --> 01:49:51.880\nWell, just straight up.\n\n01:49:51.880 --> 01:49:52.880\nDemocrats.\n\n01:49:52.880 --> 01:49:53.880\nDemocrats.\n\n01:49:53.880 --> 01:49:57.880\nIf you see the Michael Moore documentary though, the recent one, I just told you about\n\n01:49:57.880 --> 01:49:58.880\nit.\n\n01:49:58.880 --> 01:49:59.880\nDammit.\n\n01:49:59.880 --> 01:50:00.880\nIt fucking shook us right into the Bernie camp.\n\n01:50:00.880 --> 01:50:03.720\nLike we're like, God damn Obama's a piece of shit.\n\n01:50:03.720 --> 01:50:11.640\nLike I did not, I did not expect the Michael Moore documentary to make me go, fuck Democrats.\n\n01:50:11.640 --> 01:50:19.920\nIt was a really disappointing story and it was a weird like a papamatic bubble of shit\n\n01:50:19.920 --> 01:50:20.920\nballs.\n\n01:50:20.920 --> 01:50:22.360\nLike this whole thing is fucked.\n\n01:50:22.360 --> 01:50:25.800\nI never, I, I, I guess I'm glad for it.\n\n01:50:25.800 --> 01:50:32.680\nBut anyways, it's, but Sam was like, it's, it's like, like, like he was, he was a died\n\n01:50:32.680 --> 01:50:33.680\nin the world.\n\n01:50:33.680 --> 01:50:34.680\nDemocrat.\n\n01:50:34.680 --> 01:50:38.600\nHe's like, look, we got to, we got to make this tent and like, like goes straight forward.\n\n01:50:38.600 --> 01:50:39.600\nHe was a Hillary guy.\n\n01:50:39.600 --> 01:50:44.080\nHe's, he would have, he would have been a Pelosi guy slash Elizabeth Warren guy, maybe\n\n01:50:44.080 --> 01:50:45.080\nor whatever.\n\n01:50:45.080 --> 01:50:46.080\nWho knows.\n\n01:50:46.080 --> 01:50:50.880\nBut, but like, Sam, Sam, Sam couldn't have been more punk rock, but he was like practical.\n\n01:50:50.880 --> 01:50:52.520\nHe's like, let's fucking win this.\n\n01:50:52.520 --> 01:50:53.520\nStop dicking around.\n\n01:50:53.520 --> 01:50:54.520\nMaybe is what he was.\n\n01:50:54.520 --> 01:50:58.920\nHe's also a huge donor to California hair bears.\n\n01:50:58.920 --> 01:51:08.160\nAll right, well, look, Sam, I, I feel like I'm suckling pig.\n\n01:51:08.160 --> 01:51:13.080\nLike I feel like I got so much of you.\n\n01:51:13.080 --> 01:51:19.440\nI just, all I did was come to your, your trough and just like lick and suck and selfishly\n\n01:51:19.440 --> 01:51:20.440\npreen.\n\n01:51:20.440 --> 01:51:25.840\nLike, I guess this guy tells me this and tells me that and I just, I never anticipated\n\n01:51:25.840 --> 01:51:30.960\nthat he would be somebody that I, one of my favorite times of my life was when, but you\n\n01:51:30.960 --> 01:51:35.200\nknow, before you and I were working and we would go to the rest again and we had an hour\n\n01:51:35.200 --> 01:51:41.400\nbefore class and you would go home to your crap apartment in Los Feliz and Dan would\n\n01:51:41.400 --> 01:51:45.040\nwrite me a monologue and then write himself a monologue and I would learn it in the car\n\n01:51:45.040 --> 01:51:47.920\non the way there and we would go in there and do it.\n\n01:51:47.920 --> 01:51:55.400\nAnd Sam kept a lot of the monologues that Dan wrote like right before class and disseminated\n\n01:51:55.400 --> 01:51:59.640\nthem to like a lot of students and some of the best shit you've ever written was stuff\n\n01:51:59.640 --> 01:52:06.640\nthat you wrote last second for, to go up there and do, you know, like a minute long monologue.\n\n01:52:06.640 --> 01:52:08.160\nBecause it was a great writing exercise.\n\n01:52:08.160 --> 01:52:12.520\nYou go through these classes and you go, oh, this guy's essence is, I'm here to pick your\n\n01:52:12.520 --> 01:52:16.280\npocket and suck your dick or something and you'd be like, well, that's specific.\n\n01:52:16.280 --> 01:52:19.920\nAnd then you're like, okay, what if that guy had to talk for a minute and like, hey, I'm\n\n01:52:19.920 --> 01:52:21.560\nhere to pick your pocket and suck your dick.\n\n01:52:21.560 --> 01:52:27.160\nIt was like these essence like writing for you, like writing monologues for you.\n\n01:52:27.160 --> 01:52:34.120\nYou wrote one for me, it was like a CIA guy that was like jumps from train to train on\n\n01:52:34.120 --> 01:52:38.040\ntop of it and kills people and just brags about how much he loves being in the CIA and\n\n01:52:38.040 --> 01:52:39.040\nkilling people.\n\n01:52:39.040 --> 01:52:42.360\nAnd you wrote that in like five minutes and it was fucking amazing.\n\n01:52:42.360 --> 01:52:44.920\nYears before Chuck.\n\n01:52:44.920 --> 01:52:51.040\nI mean, I was like, amazing.\n\n01:52:51.040 --> 01:52:57.320\nI, I, there's a million anecdotes of Sam bringing out people's humanity and bringing\n\n01:52:57.320 --> 01:53:02.200\nout their absolute honesty and quality.\n\n01:53:02.200 --> 01:53:06.200\nSomebody getting up in class and looking at their cards and people wrote down and the\n\n01:53:06.200 --> 01:53:09.040\nguy yelling, I'm not loud.\n\n01:53:09.040 --> 01:53:14.040\nOr a woman going, hard to handle, fuck this class and walking outside.\n\n01:53:14.040 --> 01:53:18.760\nLike people complaining about their own essence and doing an impression of themselves.\n\n01:53:18.760 --> 01:53:22.800\nLike there's, there's no way to replace him.\n\n01:53:22.800 --> 01:53:26.000\nHe like, I hope we're not boring you to death by a person that you don't know.\n\n01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:27.760\nWell, what are they going to say to that?\n\n01:53:27.760 --> 01:53:28.760\nYeah, you are.\n\n01:53:28.760 --> 01:53:30.760\nThey're not, they're good people.\n\n01:53:30.760 --> 01:53:34.560\nI was, I was, I was in a long car, car ride with Drew Carey, like, like when I first\n\n01:53:34.560 --> 01:53:38.600\nmet like very early when I knew him and I was telling him about Sam's class and he was\n\n01:53:38.600 --> 01:53:43.760\ndriving and he goes, I want to know who I am.\n\n01:53:43.760 --> 01:53:47.560\nAnd he was like on the Drew Carey show, he was like the number one show and he goes,\n\n01:53:47.560 --> 01:53:49.680\nI don't really know who I am.\n\n01:53:49.680 --> 01:53:54.040\nAnd he took the class and he came to me and he goes, he goes, he sent everybody he knew\n\n01:53:54.040 --> 01:53:55.640\nto the, to Sam's class.\n\n01:53:55.640 --> 01:53:58.400\nHe goes, we, we think we know who we are.\n\n01:53:58.400 --> 01:54:00.960\nThere's compliments we wish people would pay us, but they don't.\n\n01:54:00.960 --> 01:54:04.680\nAnd there's insults that we wish people wouldn't pay us, but they do.\n\n01:54:04.680 --> 01:54:06.040\nAnd you have to own all that shit.\n\n01:54:06.040 --> 01:54:10.280\nAnd my favorite essence of Drew's is doing the best I can with what I've got.\n\n01:54:10.280 --> 01:54:15.880\nAnd he goes, and he goes, I'll give you a free car if you want, if you want.\n\n01:54:15.880 --> 01:54:16.880\nYeah.\n\n01:54:16.880 --> 01:54:20.960\nAnd that's why he's brilliant at, on Price is Right, is because like when Drew gives\n\n01:54:20.960 --> 01:54:22.520\nyou a car, it's like, this is fucking amazing.\n\n01:54:22.520 --> 01:54:26.880\nAll right, well, we'll get another person who'll come up with this.\n\n01:54:26.880 --> 01:54:27.880\nYeah.\n\n01:54:27.880 --> 01:54:33.080\nShit fire in the wind.\n\n01:54:33.080 --> 01:54:34.080\nFuck me.\n\n01:54:34.080 --> 01:54:35.080\nOh.\n\n01:54:35.080 --> 01:54:36.080\nAre you having a stroke?\n\n01:54:36.080 --> 01:54:37.080\nWhat's going on?\n\n01:54:37.080 --> 01:54:38.080\nSam is gone now.\n\n01:54:38.080 --> 01:54:40.080\nAnd so here's, look, here's my thing.\n\n01:54:40.080 --> 01:54:44.160\nYoung people, because there's not going to be another Sam.\n\n01:54:44.160 --> 01:54:51.280\nAnd as we hear from these Hot Tamale stories, actually, Sam, yeah, if there was another\n\n01:54:51.280 --> 01:54:55.720\nSam, it wouldn't take the same form because tomorrow's Sam, if they were identical the\n\n01:54:55.720 --> 01:55:00.880\nlast year's Sam would be, what the fuck, that's super racist or whatever.\n\n01:55:00.880 --> 01:55:09.080\nLike I would say to young people, like what I learned from this dude that I had thankfully\n\n01:55:09.080 --> 01:55:14.400\nintersected with is, is there a way, and like Instagram and Twitter are not going to, they're\n\n01:55:14.400 --> 01:55:17.320\nnot going to be offering this to you.\n\n01:55:17.320 --> 01:55:25.360\nNo one is going to tell you that this is important to explore yourself, warts and all, shame and\n\n01:55:25.360 --> 01:55:33.200\nall to pour hot, scalding water into yourself and see how low it goes and what pockets it\n\n01:55:33.200 --> 01:55:39.960\nfills, like ask yourself these questions, what are you ashamed of?\n\n01:55:39.960 --> 01:55:45.880\nWhat do you think is this thing that you refuse to hear about yourself?\n\n01:55:45.880 --> 01:55:48.440\nIf somebody says this to you, that's a deal breaker.\n\n01:55:48.440 --> 01:55:49.840\nYou're going to walk away.\n\n01:55:49.840 --> 01:55:54.000\nYou're going to, if someone said this to you, you're going to explode because, oh my God,\n\n01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:57.160\nthat's your, holy shit, everyone says that to me.\n\n01:55:57.160 --> 01:56:02.640\nNobody's ever said that to me because I've done such a good job of protecting it.\n\n01:56:02.640 --> 01:56:08.520\nYou've got this time on earth to like open your own hood and like go into that shit and\n\n01:56:08.520 --> 01:56:10.440\nlike figure it out.\n\n01:56:10.440 --> 01:56:15.680\nThe clues that Sam turned us on to were, I don't know if kids these days ever passed\n\n01:56:15.680 --> 01:56:16.680\nnotes.\n\n01:56:16.680 --> 01:56:20.880\nLike now that you guys grew up with cell phones, so why would you ever pass a note?\n\n01:56:20.880 --> 01:56:26.280\nI had a box full of letters from girls I had crushes on and vice versa that Sam was able\n\n01:56:26.280 --> 01:56:29.720\nto tell me, go on and look at all this and of course I saved all those fucking notes\n\n01:56:29.720 --> 01:56:32.600\nfrom Gina and I was able to go, holy shit.\n\n01:56:32.600 --> 01:56:38.160\nShe's calling me capricious and aloof and interesting and organic and then it's like\n\n01:56:38.160 --> 01:56:44.480\nslob, weird, lazy fucking nerd like like like and noticing like what happens when people\n\n01:56:44.480 --> 01:56:46.720\nfall in and out of love with you.\n\n01:56:46.720 --> 01:56:47.720\nBut you have your texts.\n\n01:56:47.720 --> 01:56:49.760\nYou can go back through them.\n\n01:56:49.760 --> 01:56:51.600\nLike what do what do people say about you?\n\n01:56:51.600 --> 01:56:54.920\nIt's easier than you can like search for keywords and stuff.\n\n01:56:54.920 --> 01:56:57.240\nWhat do people say about you when they're excited about you?\n\n01:56:57.240 --> 01:57:01.640\nWhat do people say about you when they, when they're your biggest fan?\n\n01:57:01.640 --> 01:57:04.920\nWhat do people say about you when they want to really hurt you?\n\n01:57:04.920 --> 01:57:07.720\nWhat's the worst thing that someone could say about you?\n\n01:57:07.720 --> 01:57:10.800\nShit on a scarf and then return it.\n\n01:57:10.800 --> 01:57:17.040\nSam, Sam, Sam, I think if you were here would say start there, start coming up with adjectives\n\n01:57:17.040 --> 01:57:22.860\nfor this stuff, then get out of thesaurus and look up the synonyms for those adjectives.\n\n01:57:22.860 --> 01:57:27.760\nMake big lists of the things that people have said about you and then look up the synonyms\n\n01:57:27.760 --> 01:57:34.640\nfor those things and find words that spike your rage, your shame, your silence, your\n\n01:57:34.640 --> 01:57:39.000\nemotions and start asking yourself what if I had permission to be these things?\n\n01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:42.400\nWhat if these things were the only point of me being around?\n\n01:57:42.400 --> 01:57:45.280\nThat might be a really good direction to go as a writer.\n\n01:57:45.280 --> 01:57:50.640\nI mean so many of our listeners like I think a disproportionate amount of our listeners\n\n01:57:50.640 --> 01:57:56.560\nare aspiring writers because I've snowed them into thinking I'm a writer.\n\n01:57:56.560 --> 01:57:57.560\nWhy am I self deprecating?\n\n01:57:57.560 --> 01:57:58.560\nI'm an amazing writer.\n\n01:57:58.560 --> 01:57:59.560\nI'm so drunk.\n\n01:57:59.560 --> 01:58:00.560\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:58:00.560 --> 01:58:04.440\nOne of my essences ends the show badly.\n\n01:58:04.440 --> 01:58:07.960\nSam is gone, there's no more of the class.\n\n01:58:07.960 --> 01:58:12.320\nWe know a lot of people that have passed away but how many people do we eulogize this much\n\n01:58:12.320 --> 01:58:13.680\nand why are we doing it?\n\n01:58:13.680 --> 01:58:20.320\nAnd I think like and I don't want to make myself cry because I'm a crier but he was\n\n01:58:20.320 --> 01:58:24.200\na healer and how many people can you say that about?\n\n01:58:24.200 --> 01:58:28.920\nWell because if it was a Western it would be like well I get seven bullet holes on\n\n01:58:28.920 --> 01:58:36.640\nthe back of my jacket and they all represent seven times that Sam saved my life.\n\n01:58:36.640 --> 01:58:39.160\nI wouldn't be here.\n\n01:58:39.160 --> 01:58:43.080\nIt's unfair that he's gone and we're here.\n\n01:58:43.080 --> 01:58:48.880\nThat's why I'm like scrambling to like what are we supposed to do?\n\n01:58:48.880 --> 01:58:50.880\nWhat 40 are we supposed to pull?\n\n01:58:50.880 --> 01:58:59.800\nWhen I got the call my first thought was I cannot imagine Sam not being on this planet.\n\n01:58:59.800 --> 01:59:00.800\nThat was my feeling.\n\n01:59:00.800 --> 01:59:01.800\nNever thought about it.\n\n01:59:01.800 --> 01:59:03.240\nAnd never thought about it.\n\n01:59:03.240 --> 01:59:08.560\nIt was never something we even talked about, about that even being a possibility.\n\n01:59:08.560 --> 01:59:12.640\nAnd he came to my workshop, I teach singing workshops, and he came to my workshop one\n\n01:59:12.640 --> 01:59:13.640\nnight.\n\n01:59:13.640 --> 01:59:18.560\nHe said I really want to be a part of that and see what you do.\n\n01:59:18.560 --> 01:59:23.760\nAnd the next Friday night when we got together he said it's so interesting to me that without\n\n01:59:23.760 --> 01:59:29.480\nus ever talking about it that what you're giving these people is very similar to what\n\n01:59:29.480 --> 01:59:30.480\nI do.\n\n01:59:30.480 --> 01:59:34.880\nSo that if somebody came in and said I want to play Eliza Doolittle in My Fair Lady and\n\n01:59:34.880 --> 01:59:40.040\nI would say do you really feel a connection with that character?\n\n01:59:40.040 --> 01:59:45.160\nNo, I just like those songs.\n\n01:59:45.160 --> 01:59:46.920\nThat's not it.\n\n01:59:46.920 --> 01:59:51.040\nYou have to find out how the world sees you.\n\n01:59:51.040 --> 01:59:53.200\nThat will tell you how you're castable.\n\n01:59:53.200 --> 01:59:58.720\nAnd that will help you maneuver through life so that people are receptive to you.\n\n01:59:58.720 --> 02:00:06.720\nAnd you know, he moved me every week of my life and I just, I cannot, I haven't yet been\n\n02:00:06.720 --> 02:00:13.000\nable to wrap my head around the loss of this man who was so dear.\n\n02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:21.080\nAnd on Wednesday I have to sing at his funeral and I mean it's going to be very difficult.\n\n02:00:21.080 --> 02:00:26.160\nTo Friday nights is, you know, it's Sam.\n\n02:00:26.160 --> 02:00:33.520\nBut how lucky we all are and blessed is what I feel at the end of the day to have had this\n\n02:00:33.520 --> 02:00:37.600\nman touch our lives in the way he did.\n\n02:00:37.600 --> 02:00:42.560\nAnd do you guys know about his buried gold?\n\n02:00:42.560 --> 02:00:43.560\nHis Nazi gold.\n\n02:00:43.560 --> 02:00:45.560\nOh, his Nazi gold?\n\n02:00:45.560 --> 02:00:46.560\nYeah.\n\n02:00:46.560 --> 02:00:49.160\nWell, why bury it then?\n\n02:00:49.160 --> 02:00:53.000\nWhy not just let it be Nazi gold and...\n\n02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:54.600\nIf I had Nazi gold, I wouldn't bury it.\n\n02:00:54.600 --> 02:00:58.920\nI'd be like, well, it's Nazi gold, take it at your peril.\n\n02:00:58.920 --> 02:01:00.400\nYou got to bury your Nazi gold.\n\n02:01:00.400 --> 02:01:01.400\nAll right.\n\n02:01:01.400 --> 02:01:02.400\nWell, I guess...\n\n02:01:02.400 --> 02:01:03.960\nYou're going to leave your Nazi gold just hanging around?\n\n02:01:03.960 --> 02:01:04.960\nWhat were you going to say?\n\n02:01:04.960 --> 02:01:05.960\nNothing.\n\n02:01:05.960 --> 02:01:15.240\nI was going to agree with him saying that it's lucky to have met him and maybe nobody\n\n02:01:15.240 --> 02:01:20.080\nin our live audience, but lots of people that are listening to us have met him or got to\n\n02:01:20.080 --> 02:01:21.360\nmeet him.\n\n02:01:21.360 --> 02:01:29.560\nBut really he's the reason why I am where I am and he brought a lot of people together.\n\n02:01:29.560 --> 02:01:35.480\nAnd he was a real artist just by sitting in a chair and asking simple questions and letting\n\n02:01:35.480 --> 02:01:37.880\nyou be you.\n\n02:01:37.880 --> 02:01:39.640\nIt's pretty crazy.\n\n02:01:39.640 --> 02:01:43.680\nHe would listen to you do the shittiest monologue of the world thinking come in and go like,\n\n02:01:43.680 --> 02:01:44.680\nhere's the thing.\n\n02:01:44.680 --> 02:01:45.680\nWhoa, it's me.\n\n02:01:45.680 --> 02:01:48.160\nHey, I'm Johnny Greaseball.\n\n02:01:48.160 --> 02:01:54.960\nAnd he would just take it all in and go, why did you pick this piece?\n\n02:01:54.960 --> 02:01:56.960\nI like Johnny Greaseball.\n\n02:01:56.960 --> 02:01:59.000\nIt's my favorite movie.\n\n02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:01.760\nWhat's Johnny Greaseball doing in this monologue?\n\n02:02:01.760 --> 02:02:06.400\nWell, he's being kind of a shithead, but don't judge him.\n\n02:02:06.400 --> 02:02:07.400\nDon't judge him.\n\n02:02:07.400 --> 02:02:09.440\nThat was a big thing I learned from Sam as a writer.\n\n02:02:09.440 --> 02:02:11.120\nDon't judge that fucking character.\n\n02:02:11.120 --> 02:02:14.600\nWhen I was doing community, it was like, no, no, no, no, no.\n\n02:02:14.600 --> 02:02:17.720\nNever judge the character.\n\n02:02:17.720 --> 02:02:21.760\nHow dare you assume that your character's being a piece of shit?\n\n02:02:21.760 --> 02:02:25.200\nNo, the character is trying to accomplish something.\n\n02:02:25.200 --> 02:02:26.400\nHe's Johnny Greaseball.\n\n02:02:26.400 --> 02:02:27.400\nWhat's he trying to do?\n\n02:02:27.400 --> 02:02:29.240\nHe's trying to convince.\n\n02:02:29.240 --> 02:02:33.440\nGuys, have you ever tried to convince somebody of something?\n\n02:02:33.440 --> 02:02:40.040\nYeah, I suppose, like, think about, what have you ever tried to convince somebody of?\n\n02:02:40.040 --> 02:02:41.520\nThink about something, just anything.\n\n02:02:41.520 --> 02:02:44.480\nOh, my mom, I had to get her to co-sign a car.\n\n02:02:44.480 --> 02:02:50.240\nI bought, like, you had to get your mom to co-sign a car loan.\n\n02:02:50.240 --> 02:02:52.360\nHow old were you?\n\n02:02:52.360 --> 02:02:53.360\n22.\n\n02:02:53.360 --> 02:02:55.360\nWhere were you?\n\n02:02:55.360 --> 02:02:58.360\nI had to go to her kitchenette.\n\n02:02:58.360 --> 02:02:59.360\nWhat was the wallpaper?\n\n02:02:59.360 --> 02:03:00.360\nWhat did it look like?\n\n02:03:00.360 --> 02:03:01.360\nIt was yellow.\n\n02:03:01.360 --> 02:03:02.360\nGo.\n\n02:03:02.360 --> 02:03:05.440\nHe would just, you never knew when he was going to do that.\n\n02:03:05.440 --> 02:03:06.440\nGo.\n\n02:03:06.440 --> 02:03:11.480\nAnd you had the monologue memorized, and you had memorized it as an actor, like, you're\n\n02:03:11.480 --> 02:03:14.960\nlike, woo, hey, I'm Johnny Greaseball, and he's like, why are you always on it?\n\n02:03:14.960 --> 02:03:15.960\nAnd then you go, go.\n\n02:03:15.960 --> 02:03:18.760\nAnd you're thinking about your mom's wallpaper and trying to convince your mom.\n\n02:03:18.760 --> 02:03:25.000\nAnd you're like, you would just be like, I'm Johnny Greaseball.\n\n02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:27.640\nDo you want to buy a bowling ball?\n\n02:03:27.640 --> 02:03:33.960\nAnd almost invariably, sometimes twice, sometimes he'd do it three times.\n\n02:03:33.960 --> 02:03:38.640\nEvery once in a while, you'd get the sense of like, yeah, this person needs another.\n\n02:03:38.640 --> 02:03:39.960\nThey need to mold us over.\n\n02:03:39.960 --> 02:03:44.720\nBut most of the time, it was like watching a chiropractor on a caveman.\n\n02:03:44.720 --> 02:03:50.760\nJust go, crack, like, where you came in one way, and he just would go, broop.\n\n02:03:50.760 --> 02:03:51.760\nYou memorized this model.\n\n02:03:51.760 --> 02:03:52.760\nLike, there you go.\n\n02:03:52.760 --> 02:03:53.760\nDo this.\n\n02:03:53.760 --> 02:03:54.960\nAnd then you would do it completely differently.\n\n02:03:54.960 --> 02:04:00.720\nAnd the room would be silent because you had nailed the Johnny Greaseball monologue.\n\n02:04:00.720 --> 02:04:04.720\nActor or not, good actor, bad actor, who gives a shit?\n\n02:04:04.720 --> 02:04:08.400\nYou were sitting in a chair, and he was like, you memorized it.\n\n02:04:08.400 --> 02:04:14.200\nNow, say it like you're trying to convince somebody, if that's what the intention is.\n\n02:04:14.200 --> 02:04:17.440\nAnd he was like, you would walk out of there going, holy shit.\n\n02:04:17.440 --> 02:04:21.360\nHe told a great story about Robert DeVall, who he worked on Network with.\n\n02:04:21.360 --> 02:04:27.280\nAnd I did one of Robert DeVall's monologues from that, where he's firing William Holden.\n\n02:04:27.280 --> 02:04:30.480\nAnd I did it again a couple of times, and it went okay.\n\n02:04:30.480 --> 02:04:33.640\nAnd I said, when Robert DeVall did that, like, how many takes was that?\n\n02:04:33.640 --> 02:04:34.640\nWas that like take 10?\n\n02:04:34.640 --> 02:04:36.640\nAnd he goes, he did it once.\n\n02:04:36.640 --> 02:04:39.920\nAnd he's like, that's how good Robert DeVall was.\n\n02:04:39.920 --> 02:04:42.920\nAnd when he did the, what was the profit?\n\n02:04:42.920 --> 02:04:44.520\nWhat was that one called?\n\n02:04:44.520 --> 02:04:47.520\nWhere he was, fuck, okay.\n\n02:04:47.520 --> 02:04:50.360\nThe apostle, thank you.\n\n02:04:50.360 --> 02:04:53.640\nHe asked him in an interview, how do you prepare for that?\n\n02:04:53.640 --> 02:04:57.400\nAnd he goes, I'm so good at this now, I've been doing it for so long, I don't really\n\n02:04:57.400 --> 02:04:58.400\nhave to prepare.\n\n02:04:58.400 --> 02:04:59.400\nI just learned the lines.\n\n02:04:59.400 --> 02:05:03.280\nAnd I think of one thing, and this is a great thing that Sam told me, because I overcomplicate\n\n02:05:03.280 --> 02:05:04.280\nthings.\n\n02:05:04.280 --> 02:05:08.480\nHe said, I walk on the set, and I just look, I just find something.\n\n02:05:08.480 --> 02:05:11.640\nAnd when I did that monologue, I looked up and I said, wow, there's a lot of lights up\n\n02:05:11.640 --> 02:05:12.640\nthere.\n\n02:05:12.640 --> 02:05:16.080\nIt sounds like cheating, you're an actor.\n\n02:05:16.080 --> 02:05:19.560\nAnd then he goes, just one thing that makes you feel like a human being.\n\n02:05:19.560 --> 02:05:22.240\nLike one thing that puts you in the present moment.\n\n02:05:22.240 --> 02:05:26.400\nNot your preparation or anything, it's, oh, geez, look at all these lights.\n\n02:05:26.400 --> 02:05:28.600\nAnd then he goes, he goes, I know the shit's there.\n\n02:05:28.600 --> 02:05:33.000\nAnd that's what Sam taught me, is like, you have all of the emotions right there.\n\n02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:34.280\nLike just let them happen.\n\n02:05:34.280 --> 02:05:35.280\nYou can do that.\n\n02:05:35.280 --> 02:05:36.760\nAnd don't overthink things.\n\n02:05:36.760 --> 02:05:38.320\nAnyway, we love you, Sam.\n\n02:05:38.320 --> 02:05:40.480\nSchrab, you've been awful quiet.\n\n02:05:40.480 --> 02:05:41.480\nYeah.\n\n02:05:41.480 --> 02:05:43.800\nOh, Jesus, it's 10, 10.\n\n02:05:43.800 --> 02:05:44.800\nI know.\n\n02:05:44.800 --> 02:05:45.800\nWe've gone over.\n\n02:05:45.800 --> 02:05:46.800\nFuck.\n\n02:05:46.800 --> 02:05:49.440\nI mean, Sam would not want to be remembered for that extra long podcast.\n\n02:05:49.440 --> 02:05:52.040\nDo you want to put a little punctuation on this, Schrab?\n\n02:05:52.040 --> 02:05:54.440\nIf I can earn your keep.\n\n02:05:54.440 --> 02:05:56.440\nEarn my keep.\n\n02:05:56.440 --> 02:06:04.280\nNo, I mean, I've been quiet a long because, I mean, Sam does mean like so much to me.\n\n02:06:04.280 --> 02:06:05.280\nProve it.\n\n02:06:05.280 --> 02:06:12.080\nAnd it's hard to not talk about him without getting choked up.\n\n02:06:12.080 --> 02:06:15.960\nSo that's why I've been quiet.\n\n02:06:15.960 --> 02:06:26.520\nAnd no, Sam taught me a lot about just believing in myself and who I was and just being happy\n\n02:06:26.520 --> 02:06:30.200\nin my own skin.\n\n02:06:30.200 --> 02:06:31.200\nAnd that's it.\n\n02:06:31.200 --> 02:06:33.200\nWell, let's take that moment to silence.\n\n02:06:33.200 --> 02:06:34.200\nI'm sorry.\n\n02:06:34.200 --> 02:06:35.200\nI'm breaking up.\n\n02:06:35.200 --> 02:06:36.200\nWe love you, Sam.\n\n02:06:36.200 --> 02:06:37.200\nGoodbye, Sam.\n\n02:06:37.200 --> 02:06:38.200\nThat's been Harmontown.\n\n02:06:38.200 --> 02:06:39.200\nThank you so much, you guys.\n\n02:06:39.200 --> 02:06:40.200\nCody and Randy Heller.\n\n02:06:40.200 --> 02:06:49.600\nBob Garrett, thank you so much for being with us.\n\n02:06:49.600 --> 02:06:51.960\nRob Schrab, everybody.\n\n02:06:51.960 --> 02:06:54.760\nI'm Jeff Davis, your crying comptroller.\n\n02:06:54.760 --> 02:06:55.920\nDan Harmon's been your mayor.\n\n02:06:55.920 --> 02:06:56.920\nThank you all so much for coming.\n\n02:06:56.920 --> 02:06:57.920\nWe love you.\n\n02:06:57.920 --> 02:07:01.920\nAnd it's Church Road from Nick Cave.\n\n02:07:01.920 --> 02:07:03.920\nEmbrace your floods.\n\n02:07:03.920 --> 02:07:06.440\nThey're the only thing of interest that you have.\n\n02:07:06.440 --> 02:07:13.440\nThey're my fast-to-take chances on.\n\n02:07:13.440 --> 02:07:32.440\nDid you get any of that?\n\n02:07:32.440 --> 02:07:39.440\nWell, I'll see you in the next video.\n\n02:07:39.440 --> 02:07:40.440\nBye.\n\n02:07:40.440 --> 02:07:41.440\nBye.\n\n02:07:41.440 --> 02:07:42.440\nBye.\n\n02:07:42.440 --> 02:07:43.440\nBye.\n\n02:07:43.440 --> 02:07:44.440\nBye.\n","cpu_time":["0.004s"],"str_size":[193073]}
