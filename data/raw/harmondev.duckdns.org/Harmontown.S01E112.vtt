{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:05.000\nCereal Audio\n\n00:18.000 --> 00:22.000\nHello, welcome to Meltdown Comics in Hollywood, California.\n\n00:22.000 --> 00:32.000\nHarmontown is now in session.\n\n00:32.000 --> 00:36.000\nThis song makes me happy and sad at the same time.\n\n00:36.000 --> 00:46.000\nWelcome to the stage, the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.\n\n00:46.000 --> 00:53.000\nThank you.\n\n00:53.000 --> 00:56.000\nI don't know, when you started playing that I was like, weird choice.\n\n00:56.000 --> 01:01.000\nI thought about it was either going to be Aladdin, you got a friend in me or that one.\n\n01:01.000 --> 01:03.000\nAnd I thought this one was more sad.\n\n01:03.000 --> 01:06.000\nAlright, you're meeting it head on is the idea.\n\n01:06.000 --> 01:10.000\nBecause that's how I first met him and that makes me the happiest thing in the world\n\n01:10.000 --> 01:14.000\nbecause Robin, that's how I first knew him.\n\n01:14.000 --> 01:17.000\nI grew up on, yeah, that is how I learned to be funny.\n\n01:17.000 --> 01:21.000\nI remember being a little kid and imitating Robin Williams.\n\n01:21.000 --> 01:25.000\nImitating Mork, like 10 years old.\n\n01:25.000 --> 01:28.000\nMy mom would take me to restaurants and I would just be jumping around,\n\n01:28.000 --> 01:32.000\nmaking an ass of myself, trying to do an impression of him.\n\n01:32.000 --> 01:37.000\nWhen Carvey was on, we talked about how in high school I would do my impression of his impressions.\n\n01:37.000 --> 01:40.000\nMy whole life I've been a hack.\n\n01:40.000 --> 01:44.000\nYeah, it definitely started with him.\n\n01:44.000 --> 01:48.000\nIt was very cool to have him here.\n\n01:48.000 --> 01:54.000\nThe day he died, Jonah, Camille, Pat, and Oswald and a few other comic friends of ours\n\n01:54.000 --> 01:58.000\nwent to the rest again and we sat down and everybody had a Robin story.\n\n01:58.000 --> 02:02.000\nAnd the stories were all about how he made you feel cool.\n\n02:02.000 --> 02:05.000\nHe made you feel better if we're having met him.\n\n02:05.000 --> 02:07.000\nThat's for sure.\n\n02:07.000 --> 02:14.000\nI don't think it would be fair or honest to not talk about the fact that he was so successful\n\n02:14.000 --> 02:22.000\nand so regarded and so mainstream effective that the comedy community\n\n02:22.000 --> 02:29.000\nI think had to especially hang their head because, and I'll say it if nobody else does,\n\n02:29.000 --> 02:34.000\nthat there was a lot of shit we heaped on his career path over the time\n\n02:34.000 --> 02:38.000\nbecause it was just like an easy target because he made so many people so happy.\n\n02:38.000 --> 02:45.000\nAnd I mean, I think the thing about that is, is that no matter who you talk to,\n\n02:45.000 --> 02:50.000\neverybody would sometimes enjoy that it was like shooting a slingshot at the moon.\n\n02:50.000 --> 02:52.000\nI'm never going to hit it.\n\n02:52.000 --> 03:02.000\nBut everybody that ever met him, without exception, had a story about how joyful,\n\n03:02.000 --> 03:08.000\ndumb word, how sincere and how connected he was.\n\n03:08.000 --> 03:14.000\nYeah, he never, people would, I don't know.\n\n03:14.000 --> 03:18.000\nI mean, I didn't say anything about it when it happened.\n\n03:18.000 --> 03:20.000\nIt's, this is a doozy.\n\n03:20.000 --> 03:24.000\nAnd that's a really appropriate word to use.\n\n03:24.000 --> 03:28.000\nIt's a doozy.\n\n03:28.000 --> 03:30.000\nHarold Ramis, John Ritter.\n\n03:30.000 --> 03:35.000\nWe had him up here with Bobcat and like Bobcat is, is and was very close to him\n\n03:35.000 --> 03:37.000\nand he's really hurt by it.\n\n03:37.000 --> 03:42.000\nAnd we know a couple of other people that were really close to Robin and are really affected by it.\n\n03:42.000 --> 03:47.000\nAnd I'm not, you know, you and I used to joke about, we didn't like that movie\n\n03:47.000 --> 03:52.000\nand we hated goodwill hunting and we didn't like this and we would heep shit on him.\n\n03:52.000 --> 03:58.000\nBut also, having met him, you have to take it all back.\n\n03:58.000 --> 04:02.000\nAnd also, you find out that you loved everything he ever did.\n\n04:02.000 --> 04:05.000\nFor me, Popeye, he's fucking great in it.\n\n04:05.000 --> 04:07.000\nThat's the weirdest movie of all time.\n\n04:07.000 --> 04:12.000\nWhy is Robert Altman directing a movie about Popeye?\n\n04:12.000 --> 04:17.000\nAnd who did I meet that said, fuck, who was it?\n\n04:17.000 --> 04:23.000\nThey said they had stories about meeting Robin and he's like, we went to Malta to shoot that.\n\n04:23.000 --> 04:25.000\nMalta, an island in the middle of the Mediterranean.\n\n04:25.000 --> 04:30.000\nAnd he's like, there's no Coke there. And that was a point in my life when I was fueled by cocaine.\n\n04:30.000 --> 04:32.000\nLike I had to have cocaine.\n\n04:32.000 --> 04:35.000\nAnd so they couldn't get cocaine there.\n\n04:35.000 --> 04:39.000\nSo all of a sudden, a bunch of Parisian models, like really sexy female Parisian models\n\n04:39.000 --> 04:43.000\nstarted showing up to the island of Malta.\n\n04:43.000 --> 04:46.000\nAnd all of a sudden, Robin Williams had Coke.\n\n04:46.000 --> 04:54.000\nAnd it turns out that Popeye was made by vagged Parisian model Coke.\n\n04:54.000 --> 04:55.000\nVagged?\n\n04:55.000 --> 04:57.000\nLike the models were stuffed.\n\n04:57.000 --> 04:58.000\nOh, vagged.\n\n04:58.000 --> 04:59.000\nVagged.\n\n04:59.000 --> 05:00.000\nLike pocketed.\n\n05:00.000 --> 05:01.000\nKeistering.\n\n05:01.000 --> 05:02.000\nYeah.\n\n05:02.000 --> 05:07.000\nHe had a bunch of sexy Parisian mules carrying the stuff.\n\n05:07.000 --> 05:10.000\nAnd I was like, it's a good movie.\n\n05:10.000 --> 05:13.000\nIt's a fucking movie.\n\n05:13.000 --> 05:21.000\nI don't want to live in a world where Robin Williams wasn't getting Parisian pussy Coke.\n\n05:21.000 --> 05:26.000\nIt was an interesting time, too, for Twitter.\n\n05:26.000 --> 05:36.000\nI mean, there was not a single person from, you sometimes, I don't know, like a comedy icon dying,\n\n05:36.000 --> 05:42.000\nlike there's corners of the comedy world that they didn't affect.\n\n05:42.000 --> 05:44.000\nAnd this just wasn't the case.\n\n05:44.000 --> 05:51.000\nAnd that's why I kind of stayed silent because I had a weird effect happen to me where I,\n\n05:51.000 --> 05:53.000\nand this is all on me.\n\n05:53.000 --> 05:58.000\nThis has nothing to do with, it's all on me because I didn't want it to be all on me, et cetera, et cetera.\n\n05:58.000 --> 06:01.000\nLike a swirling irony of weird feelings.\n\n06:01.000 --> 06:07.000\nI didn't want to take part in some kind of paltrization.\n\n06:07.000 --> 06:09.000\nIt's not a real word.\n\n06:09.000 --> 06:15.000\nIt felt like we were just reading too much about it and seeing too many people's feelings about it,\n\n06:15.000 --> 06:18.000\nand all of a sudden felt like, oh, we're ready to accept this, which I wasn't.\n\n06:18.000 --> 06:25.000\nI've never seen a death of a celebrity that people instantly wanted to make it about themselves instantly.\n\n06:25.000 --> 06:27.000\nAnd that's not a bad thing.\n\n06:27.000 --> 06:33.000\nThat's just saying that I don't think we've ever seen anybody die that people instantly felt they had a connection to.\n\n06:33.000 --> 06:41.000\nAnd those are people that haven't met him that just people wanted to say, this is my relationship to this guy named Robin Williams.\n\n06:41.000 --> 06:45.000\nAnd I was born in the 70s, so I like him for this.\n\n06:45.000 --> 06:48.000\nI was born in the 90s, so I know him as Aladdin.\n\n06:48.000 --> 06:51.000\nSome people know him as Peter Pan, which I thought was a terrible movie.\n\n06:51.000 --> 06:58.000\nBut people like everyone had a connection to this guy because he was in a million things.\n\n06:58.000 --> 07:02.000\nI should have collected, but I didn't think, I didn't imagine we'd be able to talk about this.\n\n07:02.000 --> 07:07.000\nI wanted to kind of delicately kind of like, I also didn't think it would be honest to not talk about it,\n\n07:07.000 --> 07:12.000\nbut I also kind of wanted to like scoot around it and like have it just kind of touch us.\n\n07:12.000 --> 07:18.000\nBut I, at the time, I wasn't thinking about curating things, but I think it's fascinating\n\n07:18.000 --> 07:23.000\ncollecting the horrible, horrible ways that people mourn sometimes on Twitter.\n\n07:23.000 --> 07:26.000\nThe things that they say, the ways that they...\n\n07:26.000 --> 07:31.000\nHis daughter said some nice things, and she got fucking waylaid by a bunch of assholes.\n\n07:31.000 --> 07:41.000\nI got tweeted by a guy who was saying, hey listen man, this was like two days later,\n\n07:41.000 --> 07:47.000\na guy said, hey listen, community's great, you're great, I think you're doing a great job,\n\n07:47.000 --> 07:50.000\nI think you're a really, really talented person.\n\n07:50.000 --> 07:56.000\nHashtag, didn't tell Robin.\n\n07:56.000 --> 08:01.000\nAnd I was like, whoa, okay, alright.\n\n08:01.000 --> 08:03.000\nWait, wait, I don't understand that.\n\n08:03.000 --> 08:05.000\nYeah, well you gotta let it sink in for a second, that's the thing about it.\n\n08:05.000 --> 08:07.000\nLike you go, didn't tell Robin.\n\n08:07.000 --> 08:10.000\nOh, okay.\n\n08:10.000 --> 08:17.000\nLike people coping with it in different ways, people coping with their relationships with others through it.\n\n08:17.000 --> 08:22.000\nIn our small little comedy world, like Los Angeles, but also he did it all over the country\n\n08:22.000 --> 08:28.000\nand probably all over the world, so many people I know that do improv shows.\n\n08:28.000 --> 08:35.000\nSmall time no one goes to him, like nothing improv shows or UCB where people do go to.\n\n08:35.000 --> 08:40.000\nPeople have a story where Robin shows up and just wants to watch.\n\n08:40.000 --> 08:43.000\nAnd then you say, well you come on stage and he'll kind of balk at it,\n\n08:43.000 --> 08:46.000\nbut he'll get up there and he'll get up there on stage with people\n\n08:46.000 --> 08:49.000\nand makes everybody feel like the coolest person in the world.\n\n08:49.000 --> 08:53.000\nAnd I think, like, I feel very touched and honored, like I met him,\n\n08:53.000 --> 08:59.000\nwhen he came on Harmontown here, I had happened to have dinner with him two nights before\n\n08:59.000 --> 09:05.000\nand we sung songs and improvised stuff and he made me feel like,\n\n09:05.000 --> 09:08.000\nwell first of all I felt like an audience member at the coolest show of all time\n\n09:08.000 --> 09:11.000\nbecause he was just doing this like command performance that nobody commanded\n\n09:11.000 --> 09:18.000\nand he stood up and my girlfriend was like Scottish and he just starts improvising Scottish songs.\n\n09:18.000 --> 09:24.000\nAnd so I had ukulele and some French and guitars and he just started improvising folk songs\n\n09:24.000 --> 09:30.000\nand he did perfect Scottish accents, like perfect Glasgow and perfect Edinburgh\n\n09:30.000 --> 09:35.000\nand we laughed so hard and he was sober at that time.\n\n09:35.000 --> 09:39.000\nWe were all drinking wine but he was sober as a barrel and that was it.\n\n09:39.000 --> 09:44.000\nAnd then two nights later, I didn't know he was going to be here, Bobcat was here\n\n09:44.000 --> 09:49.000\nand Robin had happened to call, Bobcat said, hey I'm going to Meltdown Comics to buy some comic books\n\n09:49.000 --> 09:51.000\nbecause they love comic books.\n\n09:51.000 --> 09:56.000\nAnd Bobcat said, oh well I'm here, I'm going to do the show with my friends called Harmontown,\n\n09:56.000 --> 09:58.000\nwould you want to come on stage?\n\n09:58.000 --> 10:01.000\nOh you know, he kind of balked, Dan didn't tell me about that so I came out here,\n\n10:01.000 --> 10:08.000\nsit stage left, play a song and Dan makes a joke like, you guys don't deserve the show,\n\n10:08.000 --> 10:13.000\nlike Bobcat goes away, Bobcat comes out and then he goes, Bobcat fuck off\n\n10:13.000 --> 10:15.000\nand then he doesn't.\n\n10:15.000 --> 10:20.000\nAnd Bobcat at least goes, Robin Williams, I'm laughing and I go, yeah, call me Brian.\n\n10:20.000 --> 10:25.000\nBut Robin comes out and he hugged me because we had hung out\n\n10:25.000 --> 10:29.000\nand he made me feel like we had been best friends forever, like he had a cool ability\n\n10:29.000 --> 10:33.000\nto make you feel really cool, really special.\n\n10:33.000 --> 10:38.000\nAnd I don't know him, I met him twice but I kind of felt like I did\n\n10:38.000 --> 10:44.000\nand I'm pretty proud of the fact that we had him here.\n\n10:44.000 --> 10:49.000\nAnd it made me cry really fucking hard because I have friends that are really close to him.\n\n10:49.000 --> 10:55.000\nYeah, Aaron was really devastated by it and I don't know, everybody was.\n\n10:55.000 --> 11:00.000\nI didn't expect to be though, I wouldn't have expected to be devastated by that\n\n11:00.000 --> 11:04.000\nbecause I didn't feel very close to him, I didn't know him, I met him once\n\n11:04.000 --> 11:09.000\nbut also I feel like it was a weird thing and when I sat and Pat Noswald showed up\n\n11:09.000 --> 11:14.000\nand we just sat down and everyone has really good stories, he has better ones\n\n11:14.000 --> 11:21.000\nbecause he's met her more and I said, I just don't feel like I was ready for him to not be around.\n\n11:21.000 --> 11:27.000\nNo, that's what it is, I don't think anybody was ready for him to not be around.\n\n11:27.000 --> 11:28.000\nIt's a weird thing to have some background.\n\n11:28.000 --> 11:30.000\nI think everybody thought that he was always going to be around.\n\n11:30.000 --> 11:34.000\nThat's how I felt about Harold Ramis too. Certainly for 20 or 30 more years.\n\n11:34.000 --> 11:36.000\nI think he was hitting a stride.\n\n11:36.000 --> 11:45.000\nIt's a weird thing to have subtracted from your existence because you didn't realize the value that he had.\n\n11:45.000 --> 12:02.000\nLet's bring out Camille to hear everybody big applause and cheers!\n\n12:02.000 --> 12:06.000\nHello, I'm wiping tears and snot off my face right now.\n\n12:06.000 --> 12:10.000\nI'm just not sure about the Morgan Mindy theme as a choice, I don't know.\n\n12:10.000 --> 12:16.000\nI took a lift here and I will tell you, none of these people knew what that was.\n\n12:16.000 --> 12:18.000\nThat's why I chose it.\n\n12:18.000 --> 12:27.000\nI wasn't trying to be a morose, but I was taking a lift like an Uber kind of car here\n\n12:27.000 --> 12:31.000\nand I was sitting with a guy who actually has driven me to this show before.\n\n12:31.000 --> 12:33.000\nI said, look at the guy that does that show.\n\n12:33.000 --> 12:43.000\nI said, do you know this song?\n\n12:43.000 --> 12:46.000\nI played the Morgan Mindy theme and he said, what's that?\n\n12:46.000 --> 12:55.000\nI said, it's a show that Robin Williams was in when I first met him in the 70s.\n\n12:55.000 --> 12:59.000\nHe was introduced to my universe and I said, or this one.\n\n12:59.000 --> 13:04.000\nI played it and he said, Aladdin!\n\n13:04.000 --> 13:09.000\nHe said, that's how I know him.\n\n13:09.000 --> 13:12.000\nAlso, when you hear his voice, I can play it for you right now.\n\n13:12.000 --> 13:16.000\nI don't mean that in a bad way, it is devastating.\n\n13:16.000 --> 13:20.000\nI played it for myself and he said, there's Robin doing a French guy,\n\n13:20.000 --> 13:23.000\ndoing an Italian guy, doing this guy, doing another guy.\n\n13:23.000 --> 13:25.000\nIt's Robin pouring out all that shit.\n\n13:25.000 --> 13:31.000\nI go, I'm going to play it because that makes me happy because that makes me feel like a kid,\n\n13:31.000 --> 13:34.000\nbut the Aladdin one I thought would be worse.\n\n13:34.000 --> 13:39.000\nWe did After Meltdown, we played that one and it was like, oh, okay, this was a mistake.\n\n13:39.000 --> 13:41.000\nIt was just very sad.\n\n13:41.000 --> 13:50.000\nI think part of the thing is that there is literally nobody else that I've been a fan of my entire life.\n\n13:50.000 --> 13:52.000\nWhen I was a little kid, I loved Popeye.\n\n13:52.000 --> 13:58.000\nThere's always, no matter how old you are, there's a Robin Williams movie that is right for you.\n\n13:58.000 --> 14:00.000\nI think that's part of it.\n\n14:00.000 --> 14:04.000\nObviously, Robert DeNiro and all are amazing, but when I was a kid, I didn't give a shit.\n\n14:04.000 --> 14:07.000\nBut I gave a shit with Robin Williams every day of my fucking life.\n\n14:07.000 --> 14:10.000\nI remember, I saw this, my dad had this magazine.\n\n14:10.000 --> 14:12.000\nPopeye was my favorite cartoon.\n\n14:12.000 --> 14:15.000\nI convinced myself, spinach tasted good because of Popeye.\n\n14:15.000 --> 14:18.000\nIt doesn't, it tastes like shit.\n\n14:18.000 --> 14:21.000\nPopeye was made by the spinach lobby.\n\n14:21.000 --> 14:23.000\nIt animates your tattoos.\n\n14:23.000 --> 14:25.000\nYeah, I would do that.\n\n14:25.000 --> 14:29.000\nOne bicep would have a one-battle ship and it would shoot a missile at the other bicep.\n\n14:29.000 --> 14:35.000\nMy dad had this magazine and it had Robin Williams as Popeye on the cover.\n\n14:35.000 --> 14:38.000\nAnd I was like, there's a fucking movie about Popeye?\n\n14:38.000 --> 14:40.000\nWhat the fuck, dad?\n\n14:40.000 --> 14:43.000\nIt's the first time I said fuck.\n\n14:43.000 --> 14:45.000\nAnd then we tracked it down.\n\n14:45.000 --> 14:49.000\nThis was fucking sad, so it's hard to track down these movies and I watched it.\n\n14:49.000 --> 14:50.000\nYou had to go to the Popeye district.\n\n14:50.000 --> 14:54.000\nYeah, which is a dangerous town.\n\n14:54.000 --> 14:57.000\nWho played Bluto on that one, Brutus Bluto?\n\n14:57.000 --> 14:59.000\nBluto?\n\n14:59.000 --> 15:01.000\nAnyone know who played him in that?\n\n15:01.000 --> 15:02.000\nJeremy Sisto.\n\n15:02.000 --> 15:07.000\nBecause I remember thinking that that was the only character that didn't give me what I wanted.\n\n15:07.000 --> 15:09.000\nDavid Eisensteers, I think it was.\n\n15:09.000 --> 15:11.000\nEisensteers? No.\n\n15:11.000 --> 15:13.000\nYeah, because Shelley DeVall was perfect.\n\n15:13.000 --> 15:15.000\nShelley DeVall was born to play olive oil.\n\n15:15.000 --> 15:20.000\nI just kind of put the crane shot of the Popeye district in Pakistan.\n\n15:20.000 --> 15:24.000\nWhen you establish the Tom Clancy movie that starts there.\n\n15:24.000 --> 15:28.000\nIt's like, I'm sorry, I'm being offensive.\n\n15:28.000 --> 15:33.000\nNo, no, no. Say something about Islam in a format that everyone can hear.\n\n15:33.000 --> 15:36.000\nDan Harmon, everybody. Dan, thanks for coming.\n\n15:36.000 --> 15:38.000\nAnd it starts with a Germanic.\n\n15:38.000 --> 15:44.000\nYeah, you thought you got in trouble for playing the Chevy Chase Boy Smell?\n\n15:44.000 --> 15:47.000\nChevy Chase doesn't have an army.\n\n15:47.000 --> 15:51.000\nWith the Tom Clancy Chiron, the Pakistan Popeye district.\n\n15:51.000 --> 15:56.000\nYeah, like the green old computer font, like typing Popeye district.\n\n15:56.000 --> 15:57.000\nKarachi.\n\n15:57.000 --> 16:05.000\nBut it's animated.\n\n16:05.000 --> 16:06.000\nBut something like that.\n\n16:06.000 --> 16:11.000\nCamille, be honest, what did he just say?\n\n16:11.000 --> 16:16.000\nHe said, Popeye is our lord and savior.\n\n16:16.000 --> 16:21.000\nPopeye is great. Popeye Huapar.\n\n16:21.000 --> 16:25.000\nI always wonder in the movies when they establish, they go like, you know,\n\n16:25.000 --> 16:29.000\nthey establish an exotic location and then there's a guy in the distance going,\n\n16:29.000 --> 16:34.000\nit's the equivalent of a rooster going, like, if you're in the Middle East in a movie,\n\n16:34.000 --> 16:37.000\nyou just hear some guy going, he's freaking out.\n\n16:37.000 --> 16:39.000\nI always wonder what he's doing.\n\n16:39.000 --> 16:41.000\nWhat is he saying? It's a call to prayer.\n\n16:41.000 --> 16:43.000\nIt's a call to prayer. It happens all over the Muslim world.\n\n16:43.000 --> 16:44.000\nHe's freaking out.\n\n16:44.000 --> 16:45.000\nSo it's always the same thing.\n\n16:45.000 --> 16:46.000\nHe's not praying.\n\n16:46.000 --> 16:47.000\nSo it's like taps?\n\n16:47.000 --> 16:48.000\nNo, it's...\n\n16:48.000 --> 16:50.000\nIs taps a call to prayer?\n\n16:50.000 --> 16:52.000\nNo, taps is a call to... a guy just died.\n\n16:52.000 --> 16:53.000\nYeah.\n\n16:53.000 --> 16:55.000\nIt's time for us to pray. It's time for us to pray.\n\n16:55.000 --> 16:57.000\nIt's time for us to pray in the morning.\n\n16:57.000 --> 16:59.000\nDip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip.\n\n16:59.000 --> 17:02.000\nThat's basically... it's called the Azad, is what it's called.\n\n17:02.000 --> 17:04.000\nAnd it is a call to prayer.\n\n17:04.000 --> 17:06.000\nWe hear it five times a day.\n\n17:06.000 --> 17:09.000\nAnd the first time you hear it is at 5 a.m. that's when you're supposed to pray.\n\n17:09.000 --> 17:10.000\nSo every night.\n\n17:10.000 --> 17:13.000\nAt 5 a.m. you hear that sound, which I'm not going to do.\n\n17:13.000 --> 17:14.000\nAre there lyrics?\n\n17:14.000 --> 17:15.000\nAre there lyrics?\n\n17:15.000 --> 17:16.000\nIs it...\n\n17:16.000 --> 17:17.000\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n17:17.000 --> 17:18.000\nIt's a prayer.\n\n17:18.000 --> 17:20.000\nIt's a huge karaoke song.\n\n17:20.000 --> 17:25.000\nTurn around, every now and then I get a little bit lonely\n\n17:25.000 --> 17:27.000\nand never kneeling down.\n\n17:27.000 --> 17:29.000\nThe ball bounces, but it goes the other way.\n\n17:29.000 --> 17:31.000\nKneeling down.\n\n17:31.000 --> 17:33.000\nEvery now and then.\n\n17:33.000 --> 17:34.000\nWhat is that?\n\n17:34.000 --> 17:36.000\nWhen you hear that, the guys might have...\n\n17:36.000 --> 17:37.000\nAzad?\n\n17:37.000 --> 17:38.000\nWhat do they say?\n\n17:38.000 --> 17:39.000\nAzad?\n\n17:39.000 --> 17:40.000\nYeah.\n\n17:40.000 --> 17:41.000\nYou don't know.\n\n17:41.000 --> 17:43.000\nIt's in Arabic, and I don't speak Arabic,\n\n17:43.000 --> 17:45.000\nbut it's basically like it's...\n\n17:45.000 --> 17:46.000\nI'm guessing it's like,\n\n17:46.000 --> 17:47.000\nGod is great.\n\n17:47.000 --> 17:48.000\nRight.\n\n17:48.000 --> 17:49.000\nThat's time to pray.\n\n17:49.000 --> 17:50.000\nYeah, I mean, that's the safe bet.\n\n17:50.000 --> 17:51.000\nGod is...\n\n17:51.000 --> 17:52.000\nGod is amazing.\n\n17:52.000 --> 17:53.000\nBut it's okay.\n\n17:53.000 --> 17:54.000\nIt's okay.\n\n17:54.000 --> 17:55.000\nIt's okay.\n\n17:55.000 --> 17:56.000\nIt's okay.\n\n17:56.000 --> 17:57.000\nIt's okay.\n\n17:57.000 --> 18:00.000\nGod is amazing, but also kind of needy.\n\n18:00.000 --> 18:03.000\nDon't take him for granted.\n\n18:03.000 --> 18:04.000\nYeah.\n\n18:04.000 --> 18:06.000\nIf God was your friend, you'd be like,\n\n18:06.000 --> 18:07.000\nthis guy's a dick.\n\n18:07.000 --> 18:10.000\nHe's like, so, how about...\n\n18:10.000 --> 18:12.000\nI've been pretty good today, right?\n\n18:12.000 --> 18:15.000\nYou're going to be hearing this four more times today.\n\n18:15.000 --> 18:16.000\nDon't fucking...\n\n18:16.000 --> 18:18.000\nDon't slouch.\n\n18:18.000 --> 18:20.000\nYeah, you're hanging out and he's like,\n\n18:20.000 --> 18:21.000\ntime?\n\n18:21.000 --> 18:22.000\nOh, okay, sorry.\n\n18:22.000 --> 18:23.000\nYou're great.\n\n18:23.000 --> 18:24.000\nRalph.\n\n18:24.000 --> 18:27.000\nNow, Camille, speaking of lyrics to songs,\n\n18:27.000 --> 18:30.000\nDan and I were out having lunch today,\n\n18:30.000 --> 18:32.000\nand we were at a bar,\n\n18:32.000 --> 18:34.000\nand we heard some classic rock being played\n\n18:34.000 --> 18:35.000\nin the jukebox.\n\n18:35.000 --> 18:36.000\nOh.\n\n18:36.000 --> 18:37.000\nAnd...\n\n18:37.000 --> 18:38.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n18:38.000 --> 18:39.000\nYou've heard of like,\n\n18:39.000 --> 18:41.000\nwe wrote lyrics to the Nightcourt theme song?\n\n18:41.000 --> 18:42.000\nI don't know that.\n\n18:42.000 --> 18:43.000\nI don't know that.\n\n18:43.000 --> 18:44.000\nYou're not familiar with that?\n\n18:44.000 --> 18:45.000\nNo.\n\n18:45.000 --> 18:47.000\nDo you know the Nightcourt theme?\n\n18:47.000 --> 18:48.000\nNo.\n\n18:48.000 --> 18:52.000\nSo we wrote lyrics to that.\n\n18:52.000 --> 18:53.000\nOkay.\n\n18:53.000 --> 18:56.000\nThere's Pringles Dick, Chicken Noodle Dick.\n\n18:56.000 --> 18:59.000\nWe're famous for our songwriting.\n\n18:59.000 --> 19:00.000\nI've heard of Pringles Dick,\n\n19:00.000 --> 19:02.000\nbut I don't know the context of it.\n\n19:02.000 --> 19:03.000\nI do know I love it.\n\n19:03.000 --> 19:05.000\nI wrote that one on the road with like,\n\n19:05.000 --> 19:06.000\nThe Who's Lying Guys,\n\n19:06.000 --> 19:07.000\nand I wrote the song about Pringles Dick,\n\n19:07.000 --> 19:10.000\nand I was holding a Pringles can near my dick.\n\n19:10.000 --> 19:12.000\nOh, I always thought it was the guy whose dick\n\n19:12.000 --> 19:14.000\nwas as big as a Pringles can.\n\n19:14.000 --> 19:15.000\nNo.\n\n19:15.000 --> 19:16.000\nIt's not.\n\n19:16.000 --> 19:17.000\nIt's just like,\n\n19:17.000 --> 19:18.000\nSome people call me Pringles Dick,\n\n19:18.000 --> 19:20.000\nbut I never really found out why I sing along,\n\n19:20.000 --> 19:21.000\nif you know it.\n\n19:21.000 --> 19:24.000\nI don't really have a Pringles Dick.\n\n19:24.000 --> 19:27.000\nI just keep my dick inside.\n\n19:27.000 --> 19:30.000\nI keep my dick inside a Pringles can,\n\n19:30.000 --> 19:33.000\nbecause it keeps my penis safe and dry.\n\n19:33.000 --> 19:36.000\nSome people call me Pringles Dick,\n\n19:36.000 --> 19:38.000\nbut I never really found out.\n\n19:38.000 --> 19:40.000\nNo, I never found out.\n\n19:40.000 --> 19:42.000\nI never really found out why.\n\n19:42.000 --> 19:47.000\nHe does it ballad of a guy who doesn't understand.\n\n19:47.000 --> 19:52.000\nThat should replace the Muslim call to prayer by now.\n\n19:52.000 --> 19:54.000\nThere would be Popeye district,\n\n19:54.000 --> 19:57.000\nsome people call me Pringles Dick.\n\n19:57.000 --> 20:02.000\nSome people\n\n20:02.000 --> 20:05.000\ncall me Pringles Dick.\n\n20:05.000 --> 20:08.000\nCamille, can you do a good impression of the call to prayer?\n\n20:08.000 --> 20:10.000\nHe doesn't know the lyrics.\n\n20:10.000 --> 20:13.000\nYou could do a better impression of it.\n\n20:13.000 --> 20:16.000\nYeah, I'm not going to.\n\n20:16.000 --> 20:22.000\nIt's not going to do it, but I can't do it.\n\n20:22.000 --> 20:25.000\nIs it blasphemous to do an impression of it?\n\n20:25.000 --> 20:29.000\nIn a comedy show? Yeah.\n\n20:29.000 --> 20:31.000\nIt's probably tacky.\n\n20:31.000 --> 20:32.000\nHow close was Dan?\n\n20:32.000 --> 20:33.000\nWe don't have tacky.\n\n20:33.000 --> 20:36.000\nWe have like praying,\n\n20:36.000 --> 20:39.000\nand then everything else is blasphemy.\n\n20:39.000 --> 20:41.000\nThose are the two modes.\n\n20:41.000 --> 20:43.000\nThis ain't praying.\n\n20:43.000 --> 20:46.000\nSo Dan and I were at a bar in a classic rock song,\n\n20:46.000 --> 20:48.000\nwhich I think most of you would know,\n\n20:48.000 --> 20:50.000\ncame on and then started singing,\n\n20:50.000 --> 20:53.000\nand it was about pooping in some sand.\n\n20:53.000 --> 20:57.000\nSo what did you guys change the lyrics to?\n\n20:57.000 --> 21:01.000\nWe made a song called Poopy Sand.\n\n21:01.000 --> 21:03.000\nI'm pretty sure we're going to fuck it up.\n\n21:03.000 --> 21:05.000\nI'm pretty proud of it.\n\n21:05.000 --> 21:06.000\nI think it's pretty good.\n\n21:06.000 --> 21:07.000\nYou ready, Dan?\n\n21:07.000 --> 21:08.000\nYeah, I think so.\n\n21:08.000 --> 21:09.000\nAll right, let's try this out.\n\n21:09.000 --> 21:11.000\nI'm going to play the karaoke version of the song,\n\n21:11.000 --> 21:13.000\nbut I think you'll know it.\n\n21:13.000 --> 21:15.000\nThe song is called Poopy Sand.\n\n21:15.000 --> 21:17.000\nAll right, Dan, you

Zero.\n\n30:39.000 --> 30:41.000\nWe have supervisors that go to set,\n\n30:41.000 --> 30:43.000\nbut I manage all their times\n\n30:43.000 --> 30:45.000\nand where the green screens go.\n\n30:45.000 --> 30:47.000\nWhat is the episodic budget\n\n30:47.000 --> 30:49.000\nfor Game of Thrones?\n\n30:49.000 --> 30:51.000\nBecause it seems like a show that couldn't possibly be a TV show,\n\n30:51.000 --> 30:53.000\nbecause it looks amazing.\n\n30:53.000 --> 30:55.000\nIt's a gigantic expenditure, right?\n\n30:55.000 --> 30:57.000\nI bet it's...\n\n30:57.000 --> 30:59.000\nOh, am I allowed to say the budget?\n\n30:59.000 --> 31:01.000\nOkay, here.
