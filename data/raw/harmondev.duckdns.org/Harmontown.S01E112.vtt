00:18.000 --> 00:22.000
Hello, welcome to Meltdown Comics in Hollywood, California.

00:22.000 --> 00:32.000
Harmontown is now in session.

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
This song makes me happy and sad at the same time.

00:36.000 --> 00:46.000
Welcome to the stage, the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.

00:46.000 --> 00:53.000
Thank you.

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
I don't know, when you started playing that I was like, weird choice.

00:56.000 --> 01:01.000
I thought about it was either going to be Aladdin, you got a friend in me or that one.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
And I thought this one was more sad.

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
Alright, you're meeting it head on is the idea.

01:06.000 --> 01:10.000
Because that's how I first met him and that makes me the happiest thing in the world

01:10.000 --> 01:14.000
because Robin, that's how I first knew him.

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
I grew up on, yeah, that is how I learned to be funny.

01:17.000 --> 01:21.000
I remember being a little kid and imitating Robin Williams.

01:21.000 --> 01:25.000
Imitating Mork, like 10 years old.

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
My mom would take me to restaurants and I would just be jumping around,

01:28.000 --> 01:32.000
making an ass of myself, trying to do an impression of him.

01:32.000 --> 01:37.000
When Carvey was on, we talked about how in high school I would do my impression of his impressions.

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
My whole life I've been a hack.

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
Yeah, it definitely started with him.

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
It was very cool to have him here.

01:48.000 --> 01:54.000
The day he died, Jonah, Camille, Pat, and Oswald and a few other comic friends of ours

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
went to the rest again and we sat down and everybody had a Robin story.

01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
And the stories were all about how he made you feel cool.

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
He made you feel better if we're having met him.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
That's for sure.

02:07.000 --> 02:14.000
I don't think it would be fair or honest to not talk about the fact that he was so successful

02:14.000 --> 02:22.000
and so regarded and so mainstream effective that the comedy community

02:22.000 --> 02:29.000
I think had to especially hang their head because, and I'll say it if nobody else does,

02:29.000 --> 02:34.000
that there was a lot of shit we heaped on his career path over the time

02:34.000 --> 02:38.000
because it was just like an easy target because he made so many people so happy.

02:38.000 --> 02:45.000
And I mean, I think the thing about that is, is that no matter who you talk to,

02:45.000 --> 02:50.000
everybody would sometimes enjoy that it was like shooting a slingshot at the moon.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
I'm never going to hit it.

02:52.000 --> 03:02.000
But everybody that ever met him, without exception, had a story about how joyful,

03:02.000 --> 03:08.000
dumb word, how sincere and how connected he was.

03:08.000 --> 03:14.000
Yeah, he never, people would, I don't know.

03:14.000 --> 03:18.000
I mean, I didn't say anything about it when it happened.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
It's, this is a doozy.

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
And that's a really appropriate word to use.

03:24.000 --> 03:28.000
It's a doozy.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
Harold Ramis, John Ritter.

03:30.000 --> 03:35.000
We had him up here with Bobcat and like Bobcat is, is and was very close to him

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
and he's really hurt by it.

03:37.000 --> 03:42.000
And we know a couple of other people that were really close to Robin and are really affected by it.

03:42.000 --> 03:47.000
And I'm not, you know, you and I used to joke about, we didn't like that movie

03:47.000 --> 03:52.000
and we hated goodwill hunting and we didn't like this and we would heep shit on him.

03:52.000 --> 03:58.000
But also, having met him, you have to take it all back.

03:58.000 --> 04:02.000
And also, you find out that you loved everything he ever did.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
For me, Popeye, he's fucking great in it.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
That's the weirdest movie of all time.

04:07.000 --> 04:12.000
Why is Robert Altman directing a movie about Popeye?

04:12.000 --> 04:17.000
And who did I meet that said, fuck, who was it?

04:17.000 --> 04:23.000
They said they had stories about meeting Robin and he's like, we went to Malta to shoot that.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
Malta, an island in the middle of the Mediterranean.

04:25.000 --> 04:30.000
And he's like, there's no Coke there. And that was a point in my life when I was fueled by cocaine.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
Like I had to have cocaine.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
And so they couldn't get cocaine there.

04:35.000 --> 04:39.000
So all of a sudden, a bunch of Parisian models, like really sexy female Parisian models

04:39.000 --> 04:43.000
started showing up to the island of Malta.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
And all of a sudden, Robin Williams had Coke.

04:46.000 --> 04:54.000
And it turns out that Popeye was made by vagged Parisian model Coke.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
Vagged?

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
Like the models were stuffed.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
Oh, vagged.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
Vagged.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
Like pocketed.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
Keistering.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
Yeah.

05:02.000 --> 05:07.000
He had a bunch of sexy Parisian mules carrying the stuff.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
And I was like, it's a good movie.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
It's a fucking movie.

05:13.000 --> 05:21.000
I don't want to live in a world where Robin Williams wasn't getting Parisian pussy Coke.

05:21.000 --> 05:26.000
It was an interesting time, too, for Twitter.

05:26.000 --> 05:36.000
I mean, there was not a single person from, you sometimes, I don't know, like a comedy icon dying,

05:36.000 --> 05:42.000
like there's corners of the comedy world that they didn't affect.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
And this just wasn't the case.

05:44.000 --> 05:51.000
And that's why I kind of stayed silent because I had a weird effect happen to me where I,

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
and this is all on me.

05:53.000 --> 05:58.000
This has nothing to do with, it's all on me because I didn't want it to be all on me, et cetera, et cetera.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
Like a swirling irony of weird feelings.

06:01.000 --> 06:07.000
I didn't want to take part in some kind of paltrization.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
It's not a real word.

06:09.000 --> 06:15.000
It felt like we were just reading too much about it and seeing too many people's feelings about it,

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
and all of a sudden felt like, oh, we're ready to accept this, which I wasn't.

06:18.000 --> 06:25.000
I've never seen a death of a celebrity that people instantly wanted to make it about themselves instantly.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
And that's not a bad thing.

06:27.000 --> 06:33.000
That's just saying that I don't think we've ever seen anybody die that people instantly felt they had a connection to.

06:33.000 --> 06:41.000
And those are people that haven't met him that just people wanted to say, this is my relationship to this guy named Robin Williams.

06:41.000 --> 06:45.000
And I was born in the 70s, so I like him for this.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
I was born in the 90s, so I know him as Aladdin.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
Some people know him as Peter Pan, which I thought was a terrible movie.

06:51.000 --> 06:58.000
But people like everyone had a connection to this guy because he was in a million things.

06:58.000 --> 07:02.000
I should have collected, but I didn't think, I didn't imagine we'd be able to talk about this.

07:02.000 --> 07:07.000
I wanted to kind of delicately kind of like, I also didn't think it would be honest to not talk about it,

07:07.000 --> 07:12.000
but I also kind of wanted to like scoot around it and like have it just kind of touch us.

07:12.000 --> 07:18.000
But I, at the time, I wasn't thinking about curating things, but I think it's fascinating

07:18.000 --> 07:23.000
collecting the horrible, horrible ways that people mourn sometimes on Twitter.

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
The things that they say, the ways that they...

07:26.000 --> 07:31.000
His daughter said some nice things, and she got fucking waylaid by a bunch of assholes.

07:31.000 --> 07:41.000
I got tweeted by a guy who was saying, hey listen man, this was like two days later,

07:41.000 --> 07:47.000
a guy said, hey listen, community's great, you're great, I think you're doing a great job,

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
I think you're a really, really talented person.

07:50.000 --> 07:56.000
Hashtag, didn't tell Robin.

07:56.000 --> 08:01.000
And I was like, whoa, okay, alright.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
Wait, wait, I don't understand that.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
Yeah, well you gotta let it sink in for a second, that's the thing about it.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
Like you go, didn't tell Robin.

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
Oh, okay.

08:10.000 --> 08:17.000
Like people coping with it in different ways, people coping with their relationships with others through it.

08:17.000 --> 08:22.000
In our small little comedy world, like Los Angeles, but also he did it all over the country

08:22.000 --> 08:28.000
and probably all over the world, so many people I know that do improv shows.

08:28.000 --> 08:35.000
Small time no one goes to him, like nothing improv shows or UCB where people do go to.

08:35.000 --> 08:40.000
People have a story where Robin shows up and just wants to watch.

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
And then you say, well you come on stage and he'll kind of balk at it,

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
but he'll get up there and he'll get up there on stage with people

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
and makes everybody feel like the coolest person in the world.

08:49.000 --> 08:53.000
And I think, like, I feel very touched and honored, like I met him,

08:53.000 --> 08:59.000
when he came on Harmontown here, I had happened to have dinner with him two nights before

08:59.000 --> 09:05.000
and we sung songs and improvised stuff and he made me feel like,

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
well first of all I felt like an audience member at the coolest show of all time

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
because he was just doing this like command performance that nobody commanded

09:11.000 --> 09:18.000
and he stood up and my girlfriend was like Scottish and he just starts improvising Scottish songs.

09:18.000 --> 09:24.000
And so I had ukulele and some French and guitars and he just started improvising folk songs

09:24.000 --> 09:30.000
and he did perfect Scottish accents, like perfect Glasgow and perfect Edinburgh

09:30.000 --> 09:35.000
and we laughed so hard and he was sober at that time.

09:35.000 --> 09:39.000
We were all drinking wine but he was sober as a barrel and that was it.

09:39.000 --> 09:44.000
And then two nights later, I didn't know he was going to be here, Bobcat was here

09:44.000 --> 09:49.000
and Robin had happened to call, Bobcat said, hey I'm going to Meltdown Comics to buy some comic books

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
because they love comic books.

09:51.000 --> 09:56.000
And Bobcat said, oh well I'm here, I'm going to do the show with my friends called Harmontown,

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
would you want to come on stage?

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
Oh you know, he kind of balked, Dan didn't tell me about that so I came out here,

10:01.000 --> 10:08.000
sit stage left, play a song and Dan makes a joke like, you guys don't deserve the show,

10:08.000 --> 10:13.000
like Bobcat goes away, Bobcat comes out and then he goes, Bobcat fuck off

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
and then he doesn't.

10:15.000 --> 10:20.000
And Bobcat at least goes, Robin Williams, I'm laughing and I go, yeah, call me Brian.

10:20.000 --> 10:25.000
But Robin comes out and he hugged me because we had hung out

10:25.000 --> 10:29.000
and he made me feel like we had been best friends forever, like he had a cool ability

10:29.000 --> 10:33.000
to make you feel really cool, really special.

10:33.000 --> 10:38.000
And I don't know him, I met him twice but I kind of felt like I did

10:38.000 --> 10:44.000
and I'm pretty proud of the fact that we had him here.

10:44.000 --> 10:49.000
And it made me cry really fucking hard because I have friends that are really close to him.

10:49.000 --> 10:55.000
Yeah, Aaron was really devastated by it and I don't know, everybody was.

10:55.000 --> 11:00.000
I didn't expect to be though, I wouldn't have expected to be devastated by that

11:00.000 --> 11:04.000
because I didn't feel very close to him, I didn't know him, I met him once

11:04.000 --> 11:09.000
but also I feel like it was a weird thing and when I sat and Pat Noswald showed up

11:09.000 --> 11:14.000
and we just sat down and everyone has really good stories, he has better ones

11:14.000 --> 11:21.000
because he's met her more and I said, I just don't feel like I was ready for him to not be around.

11:21.000 --> 11:27.000
No, that's what it is, I don't think anybody was ready for him to not be around.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
It's a weird thing to have some background.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
I think everybody thought that he was always going to be around.

11:30.000 --> 11:34.000
That's how I felt about Harold Ramis too. Certainly for 20 or 30 more years.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
I think he was hitting a stride.

11:36.000 --> 11:45.000
It's a weird thing to have subtracted from your existence because you didn't realize the value that he had.

11:45.000 --> 12:02.000
Let's bring out Camille to hear everybody big applause and cheers!

12:02.000 --> 12:06.000
Hello, I'm wiping tears and snot off my face right now.

12:06.000 --> 12:10.000
I'm just not sure about the Morgan Mindy theme as a choice, I don't know.

12:10.000 --> 12:16.000
I took a lift here and I will tell you, none of these people knew what that was.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
That's why I chose it.

12:18.000 --> 12:27.000
I wasn't trying to be a morose, but I was taking a lift like an Uber kind of car here

12:27.000 --> 12:31.000
and I was sitting with a guy who actually has driven me to this show before.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
I said, look at the guy that does that show.

12:33.000 --> 12:43.000
I said, do you know this song?

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
I played the Morgan Mindy theme and he said, what's that?

12:46.000 --> 12:55.000
I said, it's a show that Robin Williams was in when I first met him in the 70s.

12:55.000 --> 12:59.000
He was introduced to my universe and I said, or this one.

12:59.000 --> 13:04.000
I played it and he said, Aladdin!

13:04.000 --> 13:09.000
He said, that's how I know him.

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
Also, when you hear his voice, I can play it for you right now.

13:12.000 --> 13:16.000
I don't mean that in a bad way, it is devastating.

13:16.000 --> 13:20.000
I played it for myself and he said, there's Robin doing a French guy,

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
doing an Italian guy, doing this guy, doing another guy.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
It's Robin pouring out all that shit.

13:25.000 --> 13:31.000
I go, I'm going to play it because that makes me happy because that makes me feel like a kid,

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
but the Aladdin one I thought would be worse.

13:34.000 --> 13:39.000
We did After Meltdown, we played that one and it was like, oh, okay, this was a mistake.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
It was just very sad.

13:41.000 --> 13:50.000
I think part of the thing is that there is literally nobody else that I've been a fan of my entire life.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
When I was a little kid, I loved Popeye.

13:52.000 --> 13:58.000
There's always, no matter how old you are, there's a Robin Williams movie that is right for you.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
I think that's part of it.

14:00.000 --> 14:04.000
Obviously, Robert DeNiro and all are amazing, but when I was a kid, I didn't give a shit.

14:04.000 --> 14:07.000
But I gave a shit with Robin Williams every day of my fucking life.

14:07.000 --> 14:10.000
I remember, I saw this, my dad had this magazine.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
Popeye was my favorite cartoon.

14:12.000 --> 14:15.000
I convinced myself, spinach tasted good because of Popeye.

14:15.000 --> 14:18.000
It doesn't, it tastes like shit.

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
Popeye was made by the spinach lobby.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
It animates your tattoos.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
Yeah, I would do that.

14:25.000 --> 14:29.000
One bicep would have a one-battle ship and it would shoot a missile at the other bicep.

14:29.000 --> 14:35.000
My dad had this magazine and it had Robin Williams as Popeye on the cover.

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
And I was like, there's a fucking movie about Popeye?

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
What the fuck, dad?

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
It's the first time I said fuck.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
And then we tracked it down.

14:45.000 --> 14:49.000
This was fucking sad, so it's hard to track down these movies and I watched it.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
You had to go to the Popeye district.

14:50.000 --> 14:54.000
Yeah, which is a dangerous town.

14:54.000 --> 14:57.000
Who played Bluto on that one, Brutus Bluto?

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
Bluto?

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
Anyone know who played him in that?

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
Jeremy Sisto.

15:02.000 --> 15:07.000
Because I remember thinking that that was the only character that didn't give me what I wanted.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
David Eisensteers, I think it was.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
Eisensteers? No.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
Yeah, because Shelley DeVall was perfect.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
Shelley DeVall was born to play olive oil.

15:15.000 --> 15:20.000
I just kind of put the crane shot of the Popeye district in Pakistan.

15:20.000 --> 15:24.000
When you establish the Tom Clancy movie that starts there.

15:24.000 --> 15:28.000
It's like, I'm sorry, I'm being offensive.

15:28.000 --> 15:33.000
No, no, no. Say something about Islam in a format that everyone can hear.

15:33.000 --> 15:36.000
Dan Harmon, everybody. Dan, thanks for coming.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
And it starts with a Germanic.

15:38.000 --> 15:44.000
Yeah, you thought you got in trouble for playing the Chevy Chase Boy Smell?

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
Chevy Chase doesn't have an army.

15:47.000 --> 15:51.000
With the Tom Clancy Chiron, the Pakistan Popeye district.

15:51.000 --> 15:56.000
Yeah, like the green old computer font, like typing Popeye district.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
Karachi.

15:57.000 --> 16:05.000
But it's animated.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
But something like that.

16:06.000 --> 16:11.000
Camille, be honest, what did he just say?

16:11.000 --> 16:16.000
He said, Popeye is our lord and savior.

16:16.000 --> 16:21.000
Popeye is great. Popeye Huapar.

16:21.000 --> 16:25.000
I always wonder in the movies when they establish, they go like, you know,

16:25.000 --> 16:29.000
they establish an exotic location and then there's a guy in the distance going,

16:29.000 --> 16:34.000
it's the equivalent of a rooster going, like, if you're in the Middle East in a movie,

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
you just hear some guy going, he's freaking out.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
I always wonder what he's doing.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
What is he saying? It's a call to prayer.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
It's a call to prayer. It happens all over the Muslim world.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
He's freaking out.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
So it's always the same thing.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
He's not praying.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.000
So it's like taps?

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
No, it's...

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
Is taps a call to prayer?

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
No, taps is a call to... a guy just died.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
Yeah.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
It's time for us to pray. It's time for us to pray.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
It's time for us to pray in the morning.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
Dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip.

16:59.000 --> 17:02.000
That's basically... it's called the Azad, is what it's called.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
And it is a call to prayer.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
We hear it five times a day.

17:06.000 --> 17:09.000
And the first time you hear it is at 5 a.m. that's when you're supposed to pray.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
So every night.

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
At 5 a.m. you hear that sound, which I'm not going to do.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
Are there lyrics?

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
Are there lyrics?

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
Is it...

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
It's a prayer.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
It's a huge karaoke song.

17:20.000 --> 17:25.000
Turn around, every now and then I get a little bit lonely

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
and never kneeling down.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
The ball bounces, but it goes the other way.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
Kneeling down.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
Every now and then.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
What is that?

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
When you hear that, the guys might have...

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
Azad?

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
What do they say?

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
Azad?

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
Yeah.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
You don't know.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
It's in Arabic, and I don't speak Arabic,

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
but it's basically like it's...

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
I'm guessing it's like,

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
God is great.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
Right.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
That's time to pray.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
Yeah, I mean, that's the safe bet.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
God is...

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
God is amazing.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.000
But it's okay.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
It's okay.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
It's okay.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
It's okay.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
It's okay.

17:57.000 --> 18:00.000
God is amazing, but also kind of needy.

18:00.000 --> 18:03.000
Don't take him for granted.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
Yeah.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
If God was your friend, you'd be like,

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
this guy's a dick.

18:07.000 --> 18:10.000
He's like, so, how about...

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
I've been pretty good today, right?

18:12.000 --> 18:15.000
You're going to be hearing this four more times today.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
Don't fucking...

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
Don't slouch.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
Yeah, you're hanging out and he's like,

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
time?

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
Oh, okay, sorry.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
You're great.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
Ralph.

18:24.000 --> 18:27.000
Now, Camille, speaking of lyrics to songs,

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
Dan and I were out having lunch today,

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
and we were at a bar,

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
and we heard some classic rock being played

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
in the jukebox.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
Oh.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.000
And...

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
Oh, yeah.

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
You've heard of like,

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
we wrote lyrics to the Nightcourt theme song?

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
I don't know that.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
I don't know that.

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
You're not familiar with that?

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
No.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
Do you know the Nightcourt theme?

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
No.

18:48.000 --> 18:52.000
So we wrote lyrics to that.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
Okay.

18:53.000 --> 18:56.000
There's Pringles Dick, Chicken Noodle Dick.

18:56.000 --> 18:59.000
We're famous for our songwriting.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
I've heard of Pringles Dick,

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
but I don't know the context of it.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
I do know I love it.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
I wrote that one on the road with like,

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
The Who's Lying Guys,

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
and I wrote the song about Pringles Dick,

19:07.000 --> 19:10.000
and I was holding a Pringles can near my dick.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
Oh, I always thought it was the guy whose dick

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
was as big as a Pringles can.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
No.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
It's not.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
It's just like,

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
Some people call me Pringles Dick,

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
but I never really found out why I sing along,

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
if you know it.

19:21.000 --> 19:24.000
I don't really have a Pringles Dick.

19:24.000 --> 19:27.000
I just keep my dick inside.

19:27.000 --> 19:30.000
I keep my dick inside a Pringles can,

19:30.000 --> 19:33.000
because it keeps my penis safe and dry.

19:33.000 --> 19:36.000
Some people call me Pringles Dick,

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
but I never really found out.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
No, I never found out.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
I never really found out why.

19:42.000 --> 19:47.000
He does it ballad of a guy who doesn't understand.

19:47.000 --> 19:52.000
That should replace the Muslim call to prayer by now.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
There would be Popeye district,

19:54.000 --> 19:57.000
some people call me Pringles Dick.

19:57.000 --> 20:02.000
Some people

20:02.000 --> 20:05.000
call me Pringles Dick.

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
Camille, can you do a good impression of the call to prayer?

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
He doesn't know the lyrics.

20:10.000 --> 20:13.000
You could do a better impression of it.

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
Yeah, I'm not going to.

20:16.000 --> 20:22.000
It's not going to do it, but I can't do it.

20:22.000 --> 20:25.000
Is it blasphemous to do an impression of it?

20:25.000 --> 20:29.000
In a comedy show? Yeah.

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
It's probably tacky.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
How close was Dan?

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
We don't have tacky.

20:33.000 --> 20:36.000
We have like praying,

20:36.000 --> 20:39.000
and then everything else is blasphemy.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
Those are the two modes.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
This ain't praying.

20:43.000 --> 20:46.000
So Dan and I were at a bar in a classic rock song,

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
which I think most of you would know,

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
came on and then started singing,

20:50.000 --> 20:53.000
and it was about pooping in some sand.

20:53.000 --> 20:57.000
So what did you guys change the lyrics to?

20:57.000 --> 21:01.000
We made a song called Poopy Sand.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
I'm pretty sure we're going to fuck it up.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
I'm pretty proud of it.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.000
I think it's pretty good.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
You ready, Dan?

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
Yeah, I think so.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
All right, let's try this out.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
I'm going to play the karaoke version of the song,

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
but I think you'll know it.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
The song is called Poopy Sand.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
All right, Dan, you ready to go?

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
Yeah, yeah, I'm a little nervous.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
Me too.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
Also, if we don't get it right,

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
we can do it again.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
Okay, here we go.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
You guys have lyrics on your phone?

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
Yeah.

21:26.000 --> 21:52.000
All right, Dan, you ready to go?

21:52.000 --> 21:57.000
Yeah.

21:57.000 --> 22:02.000
The recipe was handed down to me by my old man.

22:02.000 --> 22:05.000
It's basically a bucket which I poop inside,

22:05.000 --> 22:08.000
and I add a handful of sand.

22:08.000 --> 22:14.000
Lord, I'm making Poopy Sand.

22:14.000 --> 22:26.000
You'll learn it.

22:26.000 --> 22:27.000
Wow.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
I don't want to be a naysayer,

22:29.000 --> 22:34.000
but it sounds more like you're making sandy poop.

22:34.000 --> 22:37.000
It's more sandy poop than it is Poopy Sand.

22:37.000 --> 22:40.000
Poopy Sand would be if you were shitting into sand.

22:40.000 --> 22:43.000
Camille, Camille, you weren't there, man.

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
This is a moment in time.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
Thank God, I would have fixed it.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
No, Poopy Sand is amazing.

22:49.000 --> 22:52.000
It's basically a bucket which I poop inside,

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
then I add a handful of sand.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
It's perfect, that's just jealous I wasn't there.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
Lord, he's making Poopy Sand.

22:58.000 --> 23:02.000
Let's go to Harmontown in the news corner.

23:02.000 --> 23:05.000
Yeah.

23:05.000 --> 23:11.000
Sometimes Harmontown's in the news.

23:11.000 --> 23:16.000
Sometimes Harmontown's not in the news.

23:16.000 --> 23:21.000
Harmontown, news corner.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
What would you do if you got a news article

23:23.000 --> 23:27.000
about a Harmontown?

23:27.000 --> 23:30.000
Gonna put a bucket inside of Mama Brown.

23:30.000 --> 23:33.000
Come on, back it up.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
We're all high, it's not funny.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
It's not professional.

23:37.000 --> 23:41.000
It's a recipe handed down by his old man.

23:41.000 --> 23:44.000
He's just a guy selling sandy poop out of his van.

23:44.000 --> 23:47.000
There's a lot of supply, but no demand.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
I'm proud of the internal unconscious rhyme

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
between recipe and basically,

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
because he says it's a recipe that was handed to me.

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
It's basically a bucket, basically a recipe.

23:55.000 --> 23:58.000
Come on, knock it off.

23:58.000 --> 24:03.000
I'm certain that Poopy Sand is a song that will...

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
Dan, if you and I write three more songs,

24:05.000 --> 24:08.000
we have a record and then we can go on tour.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
I don't want to throw down any gauntlets,

24:10.000 --> 24:13.000
but I feel like it's better written than Ramblin Man.

24:13.000 --> 24:16.000
I don't know if anyone's alive that will take offense to that,

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
but if you are, bring it.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
I think there's like 19 Almond Brothers,

24:20.000 --> 24:23.000
one of them's alive.

24:23.000 --> 24:28.000
Dan Harmon.goes toe-to-toe with the remaining Almond Brothers.

24:28.000 --> 24:31.000
Everyone be against me because they're vanishing.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
They're vanishing people.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
It's not funny.

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
Were they brothers? I don't know.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
There's no way all of them are brothers.

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
They were all a man.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
Thank you, Adam Goldberg, you son of a bitch.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
Who's in back there in the green room?

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
Who's peeking over Spencer's shoulder?

24:47.000 --> 24:51.000
That's Dave Block, he's the wonderful artist.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
The artist for all of the meltdown show.

24:53.000 --> 24:56.000
Also, Dave, if I'm not mistaken,

24:56.000 --> 24:59.000
you're the newest member of my Clash of Clans clan.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
Alright, come on guys.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
Keep the show on target.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
Good luck with your art.

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
Are we done with Poopy San?

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
I thought he was Jason Sudeikis.

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
Pretty good.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
He looks more like Wade Randolph than Jason Sudeikis.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
He's wearing a specific hat.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
Okay.

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
Depending on what the news segment is,

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
that song could be very inappropriate.

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
What news are we talking?

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
I don't know what you're thinking.

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
There's a very upbeat...

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
There's supposed to be news...

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
There's supposed to be upbeat news.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
The Harmontown was reviewed by the LA Times.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
It was a critics pick.

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
The movie?

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
The LA Times is a movie?

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
The Harmontown doc?

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
No, no, no, no. Our show.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
This show.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
The show that you're on.

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
This show was reviewed?

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
I selected a paragraph because we're all mentioned in it.

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
It was pretty funny.

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
I think he might have written it in a hurry.

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
Don't...

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
Don't review the review.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
Well, I have to.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
You've got to get those out every day.

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
I just thought it was funny because it's like...

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
In one paragraph, he says a lot of funny stuff.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
Let's see it.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
In the midst of this paragraph,

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
it was very flattering about Harmontown,

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
the LA Times critics pick,

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
he does surround himself with relatively more

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
grounded compatriots,

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
including most regularly co-host

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
and comptroller Jim Davis.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
Wow.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
The guy who created Garfield?

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
You made Garfield?

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
What's his name?

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
What's the guy's name that reviewed this?

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
It would be great.

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
He was the co-ptroller Jerry O'Connell.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
His name is Robert Lord.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
Jerry passed on this.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
That's the reason why I'm the co-ptroller.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
But a semi-colon,

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
comedian-fiancé Erin McGathy,

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
who has a po-cast of her own.

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
A po-cast?

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
This feels terrible.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
Was he on the lam?

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
Is this LA Times?

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
And the half-ubiquitous Kumail Nanjiani.

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
I didn't know you were biracial.

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
What is...

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
He's ubiquitous.

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
What does that mean?

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
I think you're kind of like approaching Seth Rogen territory.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
I think you think you're from ubiquitous 10.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
Half-ubiquitous.

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
A ubiquitous 10.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
It's like a half-misogynist.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
That's weird.

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
I kind of hate women.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
I'm half-ubiquitous.

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
I'm everywhere half the time.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
I'm...

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
I'm 50% of everywhere.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
Can I see this real quick?

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
Is this really on the LA Times website?

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
He called me Jim Davis when I fucking cunt.

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
Well, Erin has a po-cast.

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
A po-cast?

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
That's about those New Orleans sandwiches.

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
Yeah, yeah.

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
The modern media is not reacting well to the internet.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
What the fuck? What are the pressures rolling?

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
They're rolling all the time, Lloyd.

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
Lloyd.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
Go, go, go.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
I spilled coffee on myself.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
Half-ubiquitous. I don't know what the fuck I'm showing.

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
I can't believe that the only name he got right

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
was fucking Kumail Nanjiani.

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
That's true.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
Well, I am half-ubiquitous.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
Yeah, he...

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
Half the places he looked, he could find the right spelling.

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
It is amazing how often my name is misspelled.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
Just because it's not a name that you see,

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
like, oh, I got this.

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
It's a name you have to look up.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
I would think it would never be misspelled,

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
because you're like, I got to get this one, right?

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
Jeff Davis, Jim Davis, whatever.

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
Those are common names.

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
Don't fucking diminish me.

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
No, no. I don't mean to.

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
You fucking racist.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
You're half-ubiquitous.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
This is the end of my notes.

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
Mine is one thing.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
I got an insider in the Uber community.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
They told me I have

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
4.7 stars as a passenger.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
I'll tell you, if my driver at 4.7

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
would be like, no, give me a different one.

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
That's what I said. What the fuck did I do wrong?

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
I feel like I have at least one of my Lyft drivers

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
that came tonight. Is that true?

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
Is someone here? Lyft driver?

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
We love you, Jim.

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
Oh, can I say...

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
I met a guy last night who won an Emmy last night

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
for doing the special effects

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
for Game of Thrones. He said he was going to be here.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
Is he here? No, he's not here, I guess.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
No? I'm joking.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
Are you here, Adam?

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
Oh, see, he came. He won an Emmy last night.

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
Does he want to come up? I don't know.

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
He won an Emmy last night.

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
Do you want to come up? Get up here, Game of Thrones.

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
You can come up if you want.

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
We don't bully people.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
I don't know how he can signify

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
if he doesn't want to come up,

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
because there's just darkness back there.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
I think he's doing it by not coming up.

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
I think I see him coming.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
There's a dragon here.

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
Well, he's riding a tennis ball,

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
and it'll be a dragon later.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
Loose?

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
Hey, hello. How are you?

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
I didn't win an Emmy last night.

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
Congratulations. It was the creative arts Emmy's last night.

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
Correct.

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
It was fucking hard to get across town.

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
You won an Emmy for visual effects?

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
Visual effects, yeah.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
For Game of Thrones?

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
What did you actually do on it?

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
I'm a coordinator.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
What did you give us

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
some specifics that we can remember visually?

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
Well, no.

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
I managed all the different visual effects on the show,

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
the dragons, all these different environments.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
You draw? You draw?

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
Are you the reason why there's so few dragons on Game of Thrones?

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
Are you the reason why there's so few dragons on Game of Thrones?

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
That's budgetary.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
Are you the guy that goes to set

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
and makes sure the camera's locked down?

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
We have data wranglers that do that.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
Data wranglers?

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
I imagine once in zeroes

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
and they've got a lasso.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
One. Zero.

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
We have supervisors that go to set,

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
but I manage all their times

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
and where the green screens go.

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
What is the episodic budget

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
for Game of Thrones?

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
Because it seems like a show that couldn't possibly be a TV show,

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
because it looks amazing.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
It's a gigantic expenditure, right?

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
I bet it's...

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
Oh, am I allowed to say the budget?

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
Okay, here. Look at me.

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
Eight million.

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
An episode?

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
He looked away when I said that.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
An episode? No.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
It's more than eight million, isn't it?

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
It's not twenty million an episode.

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
I know that.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
There's no such thing as a show that's eight million an episode.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
It looks like a show that's

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
twenty million dollars an episode.

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
But they do a good job of making the big scenes

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
bigger than the small scenes.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
They balance it out.

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
It's not like everything as dragons flag around.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
They do a good job of mixing it up.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
Is it money spender on that?

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
Is it cast or is it digital stuff?

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
Is it effects?

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
It certainly matters on which cast,

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
but the dragons would be probably one of the most expensive

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
part of the visual effects budget.

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
What about the...

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
I don't know if I really answered the question there.

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
Are any of the boobies fake?

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
Like CG?

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
No, you know...

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
Not like implants fake?

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
No, I mean like CG fake.

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
You know, you're certainly cleaning up

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
and boobies are like a...

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
You get real boobies that's cheaper than

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
a dragon.

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
And that's what's wrong with this country.

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
Capitalism!

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
So how do you guys know each other?

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
I just met him last night at the Emmys.

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
Why were you there?

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
I presented an award.

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
I did last two years. They didn't invite me back.

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
Because Yahoo's not a real network.

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
I was a fucking star there, man.

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
They were like, we're out there.

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
And he's bringing Harmon out here.

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
Don't get fired off Yahoo this quickly.

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
No, I'm on Yahoo's side.

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
I'm just saying, when are we going to get some props?

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
Bring me back to the Shmimmys.

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
I was there two years ago when you presented

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
and you guys were definitely the best presenters.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
Thank you. What was your name?

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
Alright.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
You hear that, Emmys?

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
It clips only by the half

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
ubiquitous protector.

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
If I am not presenting

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
at next year's Creative Arts Emmys,

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
Adam is going to send a swarm

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
of orange golf balls

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
that will later become

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
serpents.

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
Dan, you've many times called them

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
the Shmimmys.

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
Maybe they're a little

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
fed up with that?

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
No, come on.

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
Alright, Adam.

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
If anybody else said that,

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
we'd get an applause break.

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
It's true.

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
Kathy Griffin coined that, I think.

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
Everybody that's at the Creative Arts Emmys

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
has a sort of self-effacing

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
awareness of the fact

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
that we've been pushed

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
off the air, off the primetime Emmys.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
Oh, the semis, we like to call them.

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
Oh, the semis, see that?

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
No, but they look

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
just like the real ones, right?

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
Yeah, certainly, yeah.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
I held his Emmy.

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
I have one.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
I have one.

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
I held his semi.

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
And it didn't stay a semi

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
for long.

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
Became a full primetime Emmys.

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
Became an Oscar, which is amazing.

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
And then, back down to daytime Emmys.

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
Became Tony.

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
We'd think it would become a Tony,

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
but it would become a Tony.

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
Adam, is that your passion

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
doing digital effects?

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
Yeah, I've been doing it for a few years now

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
and I enjoy doing it.

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
What were you doing before that?

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
When I first graduated,

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
I was a freelancer

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
over at the Onion News Network.

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
Oh, nice. Doing what, writing?

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
No, just I was a set PA

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
when I first came out of college.

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
And then I moved to Los Angeles.

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
I got a visual effects house

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
with software.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
Are you a software guy?

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
Are you actually doing the...

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
Yeah, I just manage all the work.

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
So you're not modeling or animating?

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
No, no.

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
But you could do it if you wanted to.

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
I wish I could.

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
What do you guys use? You guys use Maya?

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
You guys use Maya?

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
You guys use C++?

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
What's going on?

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
You guys use Lightwave?

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
Is it Java?

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
Yeah, it's basic.

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
Yeah, logo?

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
You use a plugin?

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
Yeah, you guys do cookies?

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
You have cookies and stuff?

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
I heard the whole Game of Thrones is all print shop.

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
The whole thing.

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
What do you guys use?

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
Well, different vendors

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
use different software.

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
So there's Maya and Max.

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
They composite

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
Nuke and...

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
Oh, Nuke.

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
Do you ever use Shake?

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
We don't really use Shake at ours now.

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
Well, now Apple bought it and phased it out, right?

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
Boy, Shake was great.

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
Yeah.

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
There are you compositors out there.

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
I just got a semi.

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
I really miss Shake.

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
But he came up to me last night.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
That's the one with the little nodes or modules.

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
Yeah, they all got nodes.

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
I mean, they don't all have nodes.

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
Maya's got nodes.

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
Nuke's got nodes.

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
Shake invented nodes.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
I mean, Shake really brought nodes to a new

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
node level.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
Node-based architecture is where it's at.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
I am not interested in this conversation.

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
If you could...

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
You could make a little gagu.

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
You could say, I want this gagu to bounce up and down.

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
And that's a node,

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
like the transform and the y-axis.

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
And then you decide later, oh, I want him to also...

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
while he's bouncing up and down,

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
I want him to move horizontally.

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
So then you add another node.

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
Turn it on, turn it off.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
You can improvise.

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
This podcast is also a subliminal weight loss tape.

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
You can just play this

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
at night and you lose weight.

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
What else do you guys want to ask Adam?

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
He came up to me last night holding an Emmy

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
and he was like, hey, sorry to disturb you.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
I was like, this is the best fucking icebreaker.

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
You could walk up to anybody holding an Emmy.

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
Like, hey, can I cut to the front of this line?

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
At the back, you should take your Emmy there.

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
Is this your first Emmy?

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
Third, actually.

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
How many do you have?

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
He's the best.

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
I have one.

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
He has three times.

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
Mine's for best original lyrics

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
or music in a comedy or variety show.

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
I was in a commercial that won a Clio,

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
but that doesn't go to the actor.

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
It goes to the ad company.

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
You know, my genius move was

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
in my acceptance speech for my Emmy,

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
I said I was ugly.

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
So at the governor's ball,

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
all these celebrities, beautiful people

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
were coming up to me and going,

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
I think you look great.

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
Oh, that's horrible.

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
An hour and a half of just

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
random, beautiful people.

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
You're not so bad looking.

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
Did you also win the coveted

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
Pasi Aggressi?

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
Hey, man, they don't know the difference.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
I'll just make you for count, please.

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
Do I look fatty in these jeansies?

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
You're only going to win one Emmy.

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
You're only going to win one Emmy.

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
Make the fucking cake out of it.

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
I think that's an expression.

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
So Adam, are you back

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
on the next season of Game of Thrones?

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
Yeah, I fly back to Belfast where we shoot the show tomorrow.

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
Is that right?

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
And how do you feel about the season?

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
Is it good? What's happening? What's going to happen?

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
I wish I could tell you.

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
Stop recording, Dustin.

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
Adam, spoil the fuck out of this.

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
Ruin Game of Thrones for everybody.

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
You really think he's going to tell you

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
what's going to happen next season?

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
He couldn't say what the budget was.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
Yeah, they will kill him.

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
They win his Emmy, they'll slit his throat.

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
They will send orange golf balls after him.

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
Why did they fire that one guy

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
that was the blonde guy that likes Khaleesi?

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
Oh, he got into a movie.

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
And then all of a sudden there's a guy from Nashville

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
that fucking took his place.

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
Yeah, he looks like a hipster, the guy that they replaced.

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
He just got a movie. He's doing the

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
transporter reboot.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
Also, they're doing a transporter reboot.

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
All right, Adam, can you tell us

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
why that guy had to take a hike?

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
No comment.

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
All right.

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
Oh, shit.

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
No, honestly, I don't really know what to be.

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
I don't know that.

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
But you know who we're talking about?

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
Yes.

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
Have you hung out with Dinklage?

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
I have, yes.

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
That guy had, and I don't mean to

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
sound insensitive,

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
but the guy that left,

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
he had what can only be described as,

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
he had rape face, which is not...

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
You know, he just had

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
like a weird...

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
He looked very aggressive.

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
That was his character, wasn't it?

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
That was kind of his character.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
Yeah, I mean, he was well cast, I guess, but...

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
He was like a low-rent

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
Fabio, I liked him.

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
Yeah, he's the king of the rape face.

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
But then all of a sudden he's replaced by the guy

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
that's a producer, that's also kind of rapey

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
Nashville, but he looks like a hipster

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
from like Silver Lake.

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
Yeah.

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
He does look like a hipster, the new guy.

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
Alright, let's ask Adam something that he can answer.

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
Alright, which actor,

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
on Game of Thrones,

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
is the least patient

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
about

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
having to interact

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
with

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
things that aren't there?

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
I don't think I can answer that either.

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
Do you know the answer?

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
You don't have to say it,

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
but it's in your head.

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
There's got to be somebody that's like,

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
you all know that person.

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
I'm sure you have that on community too.

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
Yes, yes, we do.

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
We knew who that was.

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
You played his voicemail.

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
You made it very evident.

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
Is there one person that stands out

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
as the least patient

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
with the digital effects?

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
You have to say who it is.

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
Is there one person that you go,

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
he or she is

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
but there is one, right?

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
Certainly, yes.

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
If we guessed the person

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
and we were right,

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
would you nod?

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
I'm just trying to figure out

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
how you would guess that person.

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
Go to IMDB

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
and just go down the list.

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
Alright, is it true

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
that there is a second

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
smaller wall

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
north of the wall?

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
That should be a question

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
for George R.R. Martin.

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
When are you finishing the new book?

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
Are you a big fan of the books?

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
Or do you even care?

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
It's just a fuck off for you.

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
It's just a fuck off.

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
It's like you're working in a goddamn water park.

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
I started on season 2,

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
so I was like, let me read book 1

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
and then I watched season 1 and I knew what happened.

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
So I was like, let me read book 2.

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
Is it true that Jon Snow knows nothing?

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
Absolutely nothing.

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
Okay, Lena Heady.

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
She doesn't work in the digital effects.

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
Peter O'Faith College.

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
Amelia Clark.

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
He nodded.

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
He nodded.

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
Alright, well,

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
let's thank Adam for coming up

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
and congratulating him on his Emmy.

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
Game of Thrones.

42:25.000 --> 42:29.000
Lord, I am making Game of Thrones.

42:31.000 --> 42:35.000
Trying to fuck your mum about digging up all your bones.

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
When I see Peter Dinklage,

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
you know I fucked your phone.

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
You know I fucked your phone?

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
You know I fucked your phone.

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
That sounds kind of triple, right?

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
When I see Peter Dinklage,

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
that's how you know I fucked your phone.

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
I already told you you see Peter Dinklage.

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
No, I fucked your phone.

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
He loves fucking phones.

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
I just melted

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
a bunch of swords

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
for the throne.

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
Alright, Dan?

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
What?

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
No.

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
Game of Thrones.

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
Freestyle is a rambling man.

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
Go.

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
Lord, I produced the Game of Thrones.

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
Calling up your momma

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
on every single phone.

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
Telling her to get down here

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
and fight those killing bones.

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
I'm producing Game of Thrones.

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
Camille, take it.

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
I can't do this.

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
I can't sing.

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
That's the only singing I know.

43:51.000 --> 44:01.000
He's everything.

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
You'd rather blaspheme

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
than improvise to a song.

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
What have I done?

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
You were so against it earlier on.

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
You fucking panicked and just

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
sell out your hair.

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
I fought what myself.

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
Let's bring out the new George R. R. Martin,

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
Spencer Crittenden.

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
Hey guys. Hello, Spencer.

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
It's Spencer. It is.

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
What do you think about all that stuff?

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
All that, uh, it was a great singing

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
attempt by both of you.

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
Attempt. Game of Thrones.

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
Good times.

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
George R. Martin.

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
No.

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
Didn't you meet George R. Martin

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
in Comic Con?

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
I stared at him from across, uh,

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
we were, we were,

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
we were, there's this hotel

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
that wasn't our hotel, but we were just hanging out at it.

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
We were hanging out in like, uh,

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
the bar area that was outside.

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
There was, uh, he was just drinking, uh,

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
what were they?

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
Pina Colada. Pina Colada, that's the one.

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
That's it? Did I get that right?

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
Yeah, yeah, that's what he was saying.

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
He doesn't look like what I expected him to look like.

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
Really?

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
He looks like kind of like a Hemingway kind of character.

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
He looks like a sea captain.

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
Yeah.

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
I, uh, I met him. He was very nice.

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
And I was like, all right, steal yourself.

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
There's going to be, he's going to smell like the sea,

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
but he didn't. He was very,

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
he smelled like a normal person.

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
And he was very nice.

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
The sea is a nice smell.

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
That's great.

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
I mean, they have like, uh,

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
Cologne's named after the sea.

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
Like what?

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
Like the sea. Ocean smell?

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
Ocean smell?

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
Scent of the sea.

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
Cool water.

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
Aqua, aqua.

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
That's just what I smell.

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
Fish smell like awful.

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
Ocean sniff.

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
Yeah.

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
You expected him to smell like a fish

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
but he, he, he smelled great.

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
Not that I smelled him, but

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
there wasn't like an obvious negative

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
What?

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
I'm sorry, Adam.

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
George R. R. Martin

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
didn't smell.

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
Going on the podcast and saying it

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
to who I tell.

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
Take a dip. That's too late. I just did the bet.

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
That's not...

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
Pooping in your bin.

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
So our song was about

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
about a guy that sells poopy and

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
poop and sand in a bucket out of the

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
back of an abandoned van.

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
The Lord knows I got a big supply

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
but there ain't that much demand.

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
I love, I love that he...

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
That's my favorite line.

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
He lives such a visceral existence that

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
he poops in a bucket and thinks

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
he can sell it to people.

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
He's well versed in like a ninth grade

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
level economics.

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
He knows supply and demand.

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
I know what my problem is

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
in terms of what I learned

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
in high school.

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
I know why he's not the problem.

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
I just fill buckets every day.

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
I'm going to, sooner or later this bubble's going to burst.

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
Is the bucket...

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
Is the bucket...

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
Do you have to return the bucket

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
or is the bucket part of the deal?

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
When you buy a bucket of poopy sand

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
that bucket is yours to keep.

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
Is it cheaper than just an empty

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
bucket? No.

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
It's more expensive to buy

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
a bucket you have to claim. I think it's just a little

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
bit more expensive. You're paying for the poop

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
and the ratio of poop to sand

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
in the bucket. Yeah.

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
I mean a lot of people in the bucket community

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
have talked about this

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
and they call it the price of the bucket

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
is the poop and the sand

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
because you got to wash it out. That's man hours.

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
Oh, okay.

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
It's a couple bucks more than a bucket.

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
Just a bucket is a bucket.

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
You're better off buying a bucket. If that's all

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
you want, don't fuck around. That's why this guy's going broke.

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
He lives in a van.

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
But it's a recipe passed down to him by his

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
old man. That's a heartbreaker.

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
He's just sticking

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
with the company.

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
If this country ran on heartstrings,

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
then we'd all be

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
millionaires.

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
Was his dad also a professional

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
poopy sand maker or was just that his hobby?

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
It certainly was a recipe that he perfected.

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
Right, but was he selling it?

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
Well,

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
that's the third verse that we haven't written yet.

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
We don't know that.

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
I would presume that the father probably died broke

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
selling poopy sand

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
and the son said, look,

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
I have to live up to my father's dying wishes,

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
which is to sell and perfect

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
the manufacture

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
and distribution

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
of poopy sand buckets.

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
And the fact that he's selling it

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
out of an abandoned van

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
is that sad to me because

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
he should be selling it from a roadside stand,

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
which also rhymes.

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
That's what's exciting to me.

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
He's been selling it from a roadside stand.

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
It rhymes.

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
I should be at a roadside stand.

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
Third verse.

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
All the glitters isn't gold and I'm doing the best I can.

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
He doesn't know.

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
He's just trying his hardest.

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
This new Walmart dominated economics beer

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
got me on the lamb.

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
I'm just selling poopy sand.

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
He's saying,

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
it's like what went wrong with our country

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
is the message.

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
When a man can't go out

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
and

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
apply his father's trade.

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
Tradesmanship,

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
the dying embers

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
of a world where there was unions

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
and

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
there was pride

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
and the ownership of a small

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
business.

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
The boundaries of this world,

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
the powers that be,

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
it originated from an axis

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
that rotated on the bond between a father

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
and son.

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
His problem is

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
even by himself,

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
he oversaturated the market with poopy sand buckets

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
because

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
there's so much supply

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
and there's just not the demand.

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
There used to be a higher demand for poopy sand.

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
There's a whole bridge

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
where it talks about how the ocean just keeps

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
pooping.

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
So he's the ocean for poop,

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
and it's like him in the ocean.

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
He's trying to create balance.

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
He regrets not becoming a fisherman

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
because he has more of a...

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
It seems like the only...

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
Also because sand,

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
if I'm not mistaken,

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
and I'm sure that I'm wrong,

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
from a Richard Attenborough documentary

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
that most sand is from

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
fish pooping out the coral that they eat.

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
They fish nibble on the coral

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
poop sand that creates little islands.

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
This guy is just creating

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
a cyclic circle of life.

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
I mean, this is beautiful.

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
What's he doing with the poopy sand

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
he's not selling?

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
He has a van...

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
Like yesterday's poopy sand. Is that a discount?

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
I think...

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
To be quite honest...

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
Is the van full of yesterday's...

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
Full disclosure, I'm pretty sure he's selling you

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
yesterday's poopy sand.

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
You're not always getting fresh poopy sand.

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
I'm picked up!

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
No, wait.

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
No, no, no, no, no.

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
Wait.

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
Do make it about Chinese murder vans.

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
That was what I was going to do.

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
I missed the Chinese murder van thing.

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
I missed the Chinese murder van thing.

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
You want to try?

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
No, no, no, no.

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
We're done. It's okay.

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
Let's move on.

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
Uh...

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
Thanks everybody.

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
Alright, so...

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
We're sad.

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
We're grieving.

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
We covered...

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
We're in the news.

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
The LA Times...

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
Oh, you were also in a Forbes article.

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
There was a Forbes article that quoted

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
I make a five stars.

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
But they didn't...

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
They didn't...

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
They just mentioned it.

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
They were talking about Uber.

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
And it's all over the media.

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
This guy had an opinion on it.

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
Dan Harmon had an opinion on it.

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
In his episode, I make a five stars.

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
And then they just moved...

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
It's good to have efficacy.

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
We should do something with it.

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
Everybody vote...

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
No.

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
Everybody vote for no more voting!

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
If...

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
If no more voting came up for a vote,

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
then I would vote...

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
Nice.

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
But then what would you really do?

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
That Monday?

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
Yeah, we did it. We voted for no more voting.

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
And then you go out and your garbage would be...

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
Everybody would party for a while.

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
Then there would be garbage piling up.

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
Who's going to collect this?

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
And then the garbage man would be like...

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
I didn't get voted.

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
It's not like you vote to get garbage.

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
You don't want to collect your garbage.

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
That's a whole structure in place.

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
Nobody's got to yell at them.

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
No, you don't.

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
They say that you do, but you fucking don't.

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
You think everybody would keep picking up the garbage?

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
It's the myth of efficacy.

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
The idea that your vote matters a fucking iota.

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
If it did, it would fucking change things.

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
Which it cannot.

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
Voting is an absolute piece of malarkey.

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
You think they keep picking up the garbage?

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
It's automatically...

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
I understand that.

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
It never has. It cannot.

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
It will not.

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
Your vote means nothing.

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
It isn't weird. I don't understand...

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
You might as well go to the booth and put poopy sand in there.

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
I feel like...

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
That would be more efficacious.

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
Isn't there a system well enough in place

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
that we don't have to...

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
Deficacious somebody said. Thank you.

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
We don't have to clamp down that hard

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
on people who have a problem with it.

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
Isn't there enough

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
momentum behind

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
the cops having drones

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
and tanks and everything?

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
Isn't everything steadily moving

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
in a direction that people

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
who would get worried about poor people

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
rising up and killing everybody

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
they can relax for a little while

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
while the poor people can bitch and complain?

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
Isn't it like...

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
You don't need to squash it immediately.

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
With the shit in Ferguson, it's like...

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
It's happening tonight, by the way.

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
It's happening right now.

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
It's escalating again.

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
I retweeted

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
the number

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
for the ACLU

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
that somebody tweeted,

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
if you're being harassed by police

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
while you're peacefully protesting,

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
here's a number you can call.

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
That's gonna make a big difference.

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
I retweeted a fucking phone number.

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
And still

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
with the Spocks

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
and the fucking Asperger Republicans

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
like, are you there?

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
I'm hearing conflicting reports.

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
It's like, what fucking

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
just side with the fucking people

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
who are getting tear gassed now?

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
Exaggerations, rumors.

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
Who gives a fuck if we're sloppy

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
about going fuck the police?

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
We'll figure it out next week.

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
When tear gas starts flying,

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
side with the fucking tear gas.

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
Period. You don't fucking side

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
with the canisters.

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
You don't bother. They're canisters.

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
They're protected.

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
They don't need your help.

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
They have fucking tax money.

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
They are funded by you.

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
They don't need your help.

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
They have armor. They have the government.

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
They have everything.

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
If there's a...

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
But I'm trying

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
to protest

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
shooting a teenage black man.

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
Lord, I'm doing

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
the best I can.

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
I just just fucking like

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
why

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
why can't it be common

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
that no matter what

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
if you play that music, he has to make his point

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
in that

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
Why in this country

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
that was founded by fucking

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
brigands and rap scallions

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
and fucking firebrands?

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
Why have we

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
I know the answer.

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
It's because we're all terrified.

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
How is that going to placate your terror?

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
You journalists out there

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
in air quotes.

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
I hope that this

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
maybe is a warning shot across the bow.

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
Like I saw some good journalism

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
going on out there.

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
Cameras out in the street going oh shit!

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
We're getting fucking shot at.

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
They're grabbing our cameras and they're tearing them apart.

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
It's crazy. They're literally telling them to not film.

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
So unbelievable.

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
So here's an idea. Now can we emerge

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
from this age of neo-yellow journalism

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
because guess what?

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
No matter how on their side you are

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
you're never going to be on your side when the chips are down.

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
They're going to tear your fucking cameras apart.

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
So be a fucking journalist

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
even in times of peace

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
because they're going to fuck you over

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
as soon as they want to beat somebody.

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
They're going to fuck you over. Be a journalist.

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
Like it doesn't pay too much

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
that you should be selling out your country.

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
Let's all get our heads out of our asses.

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
Why is it a part

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
of American culture to just go

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
oh

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
this is that part of

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
our national

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
lifespan when the heart

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
throbs. There's a palpitation

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
and there's a city somewhere where some shit gets fucked up.

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
Why

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
isn't it common

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
patriotic courtesy

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
to side with the impoverished?

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
Right. It's crazy. Like every good story

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
is about the underdogs. It's amazing to me

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
that like do you watch

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
Star Wars? We took over the world

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
based on the attractiveness of that story.

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
We didn't pitch the planet

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
hey what if we ruled you?

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
We pitched them hey what if the huddled masses

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
could turn to be free?

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
We sold that pitch based on

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
Star Wars. We said

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
what if you could be broke and have a chance?

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
And it's

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
fucking crazy to me when you see

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
a quiet suburban neighborhood

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
with a house that looks like all the houses

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
that we grew up in and it's really hard

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
not to cry racism because really

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
when you really boil down to it and you squint

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
at the camera, you squint at the

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
screen and you go like if all these people

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
were white would this be a fucking

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
national scandal? Yes it

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
would. I really feel that way.

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
I feel like there's too

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
many black people on the

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
screen for people to not

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
engage in their natural

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
skepticism. Like oh these guys are just

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
yeah what are they doing? You

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
look at the live feed and there's comments

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
under it streaming up and it's like half

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
of them are like Michael Brown live

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
forever. God bless you and all this stuff

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
and then the other half are like people equally

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
infuriated that have no

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
stake in it except like a strange

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
xenophobia going like

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
why don't you fucking people get a job and stop

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
complaining for a second. It's like weird dots that don't even need

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
to be connected. These are

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
American citizens standing on a quiet suburban

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
street with fucking

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
incendiary devices rolling down them

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
smoke filling surrounding

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
their oak trees,

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
wafting past their bedroom windows where their

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
children are sleeping in cribs. Would you

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
put up with that? Would you

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
tolerate that? What if it happened right here

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
right now? Would we

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
tolerate this? And we label these little cities

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
and we go like oh here's an event. This is

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
an event that's going to begin and it's going to end

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
and there's an incident going on and we

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
keep calling them incidents but the police

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
aren't calling them incidents because the police

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
don't rent tanks

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
for the moment. They acquire

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
them gradually and

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
they're equipped for this and more

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
and more every single police

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
force is getting more and more military

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
equipment as we go.

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
They're prepared for this stuff and it's

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
not going to stop.

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
The noose never loosens.

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
It keeps tightening.

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
So when you're looking at live footage

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
of a city in your country

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
where people are being

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
assaulted by the police

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
side with them

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
you don't have to do anything

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
other than that. Just

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
stop arguing about it.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Stop

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
waiting for more details.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
Stop hoping that it's not that big

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
a deal and just side with them.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
You don't have to get in your car and drive down there.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
We'll do that later. But just stop

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
fucking bitching about it

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
against the people who are getting hit in the head

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
with fucking incendiary devices.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
That's 9-11.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
9-11.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
That ends our political corner.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
That's just me talking to the two

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
people that bitched at me for retweeting

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
the ACLU's number.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
It's not a debate and it's not an argument.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
It's fucking common courtesy.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
When there's a fucking

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
like blackout or there's a tsunami

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
there's a natural disaster.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
That's what a riot situation is.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
It's a natural disaster. It's triggered by weird shit.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
And then it's a fucking

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
delicate, weird, crazy situation

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
where people can get hurt.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
And like

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
fucking

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
the fucking

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
eyewitness reports.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
The anecdotal shit that is coming in

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
from that city

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
is deeply disturbing

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
and I'm 41.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
It keeps getting closer and closer.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
You know

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
how comfortable these people are

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
in this situation.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
You realize that we are going to

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
live in a world

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
where they are already prepared for it

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
and we're not.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
They're going to be driving down the streets

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
in these fucking Humvees.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
They're going to have their gas masks.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
They're going to have their anti-personnel

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
anti-things.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Stomping all over the right to free assembly.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Stomping all over the right to freedom of speech.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
They're all geared up for it.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
And we're having fucking arguments about it

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
because we want more clicks or less clicks

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
or whatever the fuck we want access.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
We are not angry enough.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
We are not outraged enough. We're not

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
hair-trigger enough. We should be skeptical.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
It's our patriotic duty to be skeptical

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
of the people that control us.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
That's absolutely illegal now.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
Descent is not something legal anymore.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
It used to be and theoretically it still is

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
but descent about the way...

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
What about this concept? I'm sorry.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
Being monitored

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
by the authorities.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
It's a good image about how if you're not

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
guilty of something you have nothing to worry about.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
Remember that old thing?

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
How the fuck doesn't that apply to the fucking people

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
that are out there enforcing the law?

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
Why the hell...

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
Why can we afford fucking drones

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
and we can't afford fucking cameras?

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
Put them on their hatch, put them in their armpits.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
What cameras everywhere on these motherfuckers?

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
I'm paying them. I know it's not a hard job.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
It's not an easy job.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
You are a hero and you're out there.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
There's body cams and head cams.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
They're $900 or $950 apiece.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
They could put them on.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
But cops won't put them on because...

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
Because it's an invasion of their privacy

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
and I don't blame them for feeling that way

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
because they're human beings.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
Wait, what's your stand?

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
I'm pointing out

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
that if we should...

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
Why do we always start with criminals

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
and pets and children

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
and we don't start with cops

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
because the cops need to do their job

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
and none of us can do our jobs

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
and we're being surveilled.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
None of us can be Americans when we're being surveilled.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
So either all

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
or fucking start with them.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
I don't know. That's my point, I guess.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
Before there's a fucking camera

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
on every goddamn instance

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
of every part of our private lives

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
that can be used for or against us.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
Start with cops.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Let's use that fund for that.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
I prefer disorder over organized

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
order which is a police state.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
I'd rather that be chaos.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
The fundamental idea

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
that everything has to be completely controlled

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
from the police.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
And if we're animals

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
and we can't be contained

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
then let's address that problem.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
If you can't control a city

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
if the system isn't working at all

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
then let's start having that conversation

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
because we keep downshifting

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
into these animals

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
in this basin

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
they're having a little bit of a tantrum.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
They need to time out. They need some tear gas.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
How many of these

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
how is this going to work?

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
I'll tell you how it's going to work.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
The lines are going to keep being blurred

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
and there's just going to be dudes

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
and bulletproof fucking swat gear

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
paramilitary people

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
patrolling

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
every street that you're on

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
and if you're not guilty of anything

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
you have nothing to worry about.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
If they give police, the cynic in me says

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
if you give the police his headcams

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
and they have these things that you can turn on

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
to a house

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
because there's a crime in progress

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
or maybe

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
I think a lot of those cameras are going to fall off

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
a lot of them are going to be broken

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
there's no way to control that.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
We're already in a culture of broken cameras apparently

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
a lot of cameras are getting broken in Ferguson

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
there was a live stream today

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
of the cops threatening a reporter

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
threatening to shoot him, this video of it

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
cotton camera threatening to mace one reporter

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
and shoot another

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
tonight it's happening right now

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
this is a footage of cops

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
ushering

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
media away

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
throwing their equipment

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
and destroying it

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
I haven't actually seen it, maybe I'm spreading it

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
no I saw a video, it's a smoke bomb

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
comes, the people running, the cops show up

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
and turn all the cameras to point them all down at the ground

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
which is illegal

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
it's amazing

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
and also philosophically why are you doing this

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
is it illegal? I don't know that it is illegal

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
they call it why are you doing this

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
we know that it's fundamentally illegal

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
but no one's going to do anything about that

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
you're a terrorist

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
for ever flexing up

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
back at a cop and saying no

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
First Amendment rights and stuff like that

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
the definition of what is legal

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
what is not legal goes out the window

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
at the moment, there's any fur flying out in the air

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
I just say start from the ground up

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
like grassroots because none of us

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
we all have shit to do

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
we should all go out and vote

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
voting is going to fucking fix it

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
it's

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
let's accept the fact

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
let's accept the fact

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
freedom of speech

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
speech was free until they said it was fucking free

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
at the moment, who is it?

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Thomas Jefferson? the moment that we say

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
speech is free is the last time it was free

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
now it's going to be lawyers arguing about

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
what includes free speech

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
can you yell fire in a public place? no you can't

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
so a circle is drawn around free speech

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
and it encloses and closes and encloses

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
there's nothing free, there's no fucking First Amendment

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
there's no, and if people are fucking

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
all fight about the Second Amendment

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
fuck you, fuck your guns, fuck everything

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
the first thing should be

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
the ability for people to have liberty

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
and I think that goes away

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
every fucking single day

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
and it's illegal to say anything

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
anymore, dissent became illegal

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
here's the thing, because

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
when you have political conversations

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
they always come down to this point where

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
250 million people who have

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
better shit to do are faced with the choice

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
between going out and doing a bunch

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
of shit that's a big inconvenience to them

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
or going on with their normal lives

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
like I think

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
that a successful political movement

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
can actually be

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
successful if all

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
250 million people just decide

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
very casually

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
to ignore everything

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
to stop

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
siding with the people with the guns

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
when you next time you're talking about this

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
with your wife, with your husband

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
with your children at a party

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
online just

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
that Republican part of you

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
fucking let it go

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
because are you going to be

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
rich is that what you're worried about

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
do you think that

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
if you sell out

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
capitalism it's going to turn

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
its back on you and you're not going to get

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
to be a high roller

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
is that what's going on

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
you're one scratch off away

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
you're one promotion away

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
from the myth of retirement

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
there's such a thing as capitalism

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
without fucking elitism

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
and so much hierarchy

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
you do not have to oppress people

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
you do not have to worship people that have more money than you

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
you can be at a party

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
and if someone brings up a topic like this

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
you can casually

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
and coolly and smartly

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
and wittily and funnily say

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
and a lot of other made up adverbs

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
all I know man

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
is if there's a fucking dude

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
and a tank I side with the dude

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
that's all I know

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
and if 250 million people

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
feel that way

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
that is called democracy and capitalism

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
will take its course

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
because there won't be any money

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
in making people

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
in playing to the other thing

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
they've got us freaked out

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
they make us think

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
that we're going to be all rich one day

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
and that we need to keep kissing ass

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
and clawing our way up

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
and shitting on the people who dare

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
to protest and complain

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
down below us

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
I think that's the key

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
we don't have to fucking go out and wheat paste flyers

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
and play red rover

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
you know

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
you get sprayed in the face with shit

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
those people are heroes

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
but you can fight the fight

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
at a fucking party hanging out

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
smoking pot playing video games

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
retweeting phone numbers

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
and the zeitgeist

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
is if people put a thermometer in that turkey

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
and it comes back oh shit

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
they don't like us very much

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
let's try that methodology first

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
change your attitude

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
no one wants to take your money

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
no one wants to take your fucking anything

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
everyone wants you to be American and free

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
and love your family and have your children

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
and your Thanksgiving and all your shit

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
there's no culture war

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
no one's coming at you

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
fuck you

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
it's all

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
it's all true

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
every single word

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
it's all true

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
I had a weird story

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
life event that happened as kind of relating to this

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
I retweeted an article

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
that posited that

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
what was it tear gas actually acts as a nerve agent

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
like

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
similarly the nerve gas

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
and that it directly stimulates your nerves

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
causing reaction rather than just like

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
being a formal irritant

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
retweeted it and someone

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
some old guy was like

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
that's bullshit stop spreading rumors

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
and I was like well that's

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
a weirdly bold stance

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
and I was like you didn't read the article did you

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
and he's like I read the article

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
it's all rumors stop spreading them

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
and I was like who the fuck are you

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
what are you talking about it's just some old guy

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
with a weird military haircut

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
and he's like I've been an expert of chemical weapons

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
for 21 years

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
and I was like oh well fuck

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
you seem like a bad guy

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
and then so I started doing my research

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
and I was like okay nerve gas

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
it uh it

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
stimulates the nerves so it's

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
it's a nerve gas it's a nerve gas

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
and I didn't know what to do

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
because this guy's an expert and I'm obviously

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
a guy who's retweeting links

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
and then one of my followers

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
or someone else retweets

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
both of us and says Dan Cosetta

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
is a fraud don't trust him

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
and he linked an MIT article that an MIT professor

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
wrote

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
that was like Dan Cosetta is active on Twitter

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
and claims to be an expert

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
but in dealings with him I found his own

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
and it was just like this crazy

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
paper debunking this asshole

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
and I'm just sitting like watching

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
all this stuff happen

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
wait which guy was Cosetta the guy you were

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
Dan Cosetta was this this expert that was calling bullshit on the thing

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
and I was just like this is so weird

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
I just wanted to

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
it's an interesting article

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
like why are you

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
allowed to be wrong

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
and spread rumors

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
and be

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
irresponsible also not the point

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
whether it's a nerve agent I think that

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
I think that the

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
responsibility starts

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
and ends with the fucking

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
guns and the tear gas

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
and the things and the people who are getting paid

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
and if they show up with like tanks

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
people are gonna have a negative reaction to that

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
you can't show up looking like you're fucking

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
and that is not time to meet the press

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
that is not time to have a fucking

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
Lincoln Douglas debate about

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
whether or not your facts are in order

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
because guess what your facts are gonna be in order

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
48 hours from now do you know what shit's gonna happen

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
it's just like

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
it's called folklore if a tank

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
rolls down your street guess what everybody gets to do

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
they get to make shit up

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
that's called our tank

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
I don't know about that

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
I fucking do know about it

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
that is the only thing

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
that's keeping them from rolling over us

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
with tanks now

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
is lying about it

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
PR is called

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
us like getting to go

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
oh yeah fucking

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
these guys are bad guys

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
what do you mean bad guys let's define the word bad

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
fuck that fuck all of it

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
it's a fucking tank man

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
fuck that exaggerate lie

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
spread rumors

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
you're under attack

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
fuck off

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
the truth is crazy

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
on the guy too

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
yeah he was shot six times

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
two in the head

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
twice in the head from a distance

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
in the back

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
well some of them are in the back

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
alright

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
we've covered a lot of ground

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
in this podcast

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
I'm biting my tongue cause all my opinions are

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
unpalatable for everybody here

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
I won't say shit

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
I don't like any of it

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
no no

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
here's one

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
I don't like Led Zeppelin so people won't like me

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
also fuck all governments

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
all of them they're all bullshit

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
there's no such thing as a good one

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
the only good government is no government

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
and that people actually do have the ability

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
to live without government

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
and absolutely things be absolutely orderly

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
and the mythology

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
that we have to have

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
a structure of control

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
you don't think you need a structure for any society

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
no

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
a governing structure

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
that does like law and stuff like that

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
yeah but people can creatively do that

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
on their own we don't have to have it

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
no there's societies that do horrible shit

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
and if there wasn't government outside

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
they're killing widows when their husbands die

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
you have to be very educated

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
you have to spend a lot of years getting it together

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
there have been times in history when people tried to do it

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
and they were

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
but it's not gonna happen so we need government

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
that's probably

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
true and it's a very sad

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
political concept though of the world's shitty

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
so it has to be shitty

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
the world's shitty so it has to be shitty

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
the world's shitty so it has to be shitty

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
the idea of idealism

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
it's a good band with a shitty lead singer

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
you could need a brace on your leg

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
because your leg hurts

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
because your leg is fucked up

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
and you need to walk

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
I'm glad somebody fucking is supporting that stance

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
it's a bolt stance

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
I am anti-brace

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
you have a right and almost

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
it's a duty to look at that brace

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
and go like this

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
is a thing

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
that is unnatural, that is here

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
that I need right now

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
that I would like to not have

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
if I can somehow figure out a way to not have it

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
that's what government should be

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
you should be able

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
no one should ever be like

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
I love government

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
that's insane

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
and no one that works in government should ever be like

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
this is an honor

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
no it's not

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
it should be blighted

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
we wouldn't need any of you

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
it should be like working at the post office

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
the president should have poop

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
for breakfast every day

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
with a little scoop of saints

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
and he should be like

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
god damn it I can't wait to be done being president

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
I'm so good at it and they really need me

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
and I gotta keep the change running on time

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
but fucking hey it pays shit and it's fucking hard

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
celebrity is so weird when you become president

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
it's like why

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
it's like oh fuck

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
the office of the presidency

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
wasn't really that big of a deal for a lot of years

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
like it wasn't that big of a thing

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
now it's become this celebrity shit

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
that now you're

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
some sort of kind of like

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
emperor

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
it really isn't that big of a deal

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
it's a functionary office

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
and that's all it should be

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
and also the people shouldn't give two shits

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
about it

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
the best politician that wins

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
every year or every election

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
is nobody because most people don't fucking vote

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
why does it matter

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
the idea that democrats and republicans

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
are all that different lies

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
the same fucking party

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
the idea that we have a left

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
and a right in our democracy

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
we do not they're two sides

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
that are pretty left I mean we're pretty right

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
then they're getting further and further right

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
George Herbert Walker Bush

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
would be a lefty

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
compared to what's going on now

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
the idea that when you vote for

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
Obama versus so and so or whatever the fuck

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
the idea that there's one side

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
versus another side and there's two

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
giant differences between them

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
it's absolutely insanity

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
it diminishes our intellect, it diminishes the democracy

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
our constitution

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
has basically been turned to shit

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
also it's frequently shit

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
and when the tanks roll in

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
you're going to feel like a bad person for saying

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
fuck you tanks because the tanks will have American flags on them

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
and will be a bad person

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
not only will we be shot at

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
but we'll also just feel like bad Americans for it

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
as good Americans you should have

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
absolutely

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
abhor

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
governments at all times

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
there should be a revolution all the fucking time

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
and we cannot do it because we're too stupid

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
to actually get up in the morning

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
and take care of our elderly

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
to teach our children to pave a fucking road

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
without letting other people do it

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
we don't know how to do it we've been taught not to do it

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
well we're too happy the cartoons are too good

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
the video games are too bad

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
America is one of the best shitty places in the world

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
it's fantastic

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
we get along quite well here

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
the wifi is pretty bad

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
but also we don't

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
get to really wave a flag

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
and say that we are what we think we are

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
because the world lists the American flag

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
and a lot of parts of the world I think

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
and runs for fucking cover because there's fucking drones attacking them

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
and we torture people

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
we do everything that we don't believe in

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
and we're not good guys

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
we're not heroes anymore

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
we haven't been for a good long time

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
actually I don't know that we ever fucking were

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
we had slavery forever and thought that was quite alright

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
we're still the most

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
misogynist and fucking racist fucking

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
bunch of people that can move around

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
there's worse countries than ours

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
I'm not saying it's the worst place in the world

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
but we can't wave a banner and say that we're doing it alright

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
we're not doing it alright

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
I think we can but we have to keep striving

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
but we don't strive anymore

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
because we think we've already crossed the finish line

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
I think we're allowed to brag about everything we've done

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
but we have to keep on

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
competing with somebody other than Ali

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
I agree with that

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
I'm not saying that it's the worst country in the world

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
that it's bad I'm saying that

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
but it's the most apathetic I think

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
I don't like the hypocrisy of saying

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
that we actually do love liberty

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
and that we do love freedom

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
because we don't

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
we're quite willing to

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
to

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
make cupcakes

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
to make

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
we're quite willing to

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
let's just guessing

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
to limit

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
I fucking hate

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
governments I fucking hate them all

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
I hate Led Zeppelin

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
Led Zeppelin governments overrated

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
also

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
Snowpiercer is a bad movie

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
fuck Snowpiercer

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
my favorite

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
line from that movie it's a bad movie

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
it's good

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
you know what Apocalypse Now

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
not that great

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
I agree Apocalypse Now is too fucking long

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
an unfair treatment of Vietnam

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
alright alright alright

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
AT Third Act Problems

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
fuck you

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
Goonies doesn't hold up

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
oh shit

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
doesn't make any goddamn sense go watch Goonies again

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
go watch Goonies again

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
there's nothing

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
governments

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
Goonies

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
I was sad for me real genius did not

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
live up to my remembering

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
it's not that good anymore

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
watch it again it's not that great

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
watch your government again

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
goonies of governments

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
am I right about everything? no

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
I love words do I say every word right?

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
no until there's gonna be people that

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
gonna hate everything I say

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
sit around and talk about it I will convince you

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
of two things rush socks and voting is gay

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
also saying voting is gay

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
doesn't make me a homophobe

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
it makes me wish I hadn't said

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
voting is gay

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
I undercut

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
everything I just fucking said

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
yeah don't be great

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
at the end and then you know black people can vote now

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
so that's weird

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
also yeah we've been too soft on Asians

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
I fucking think Asians are getting a fucking

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
they're getting a free ride

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
Jeff Davis would have you believe

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
that voting is gay

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
but he thinks Asians are all right

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
Jeff Davis

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
hates gays soft on Asians

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
paid for by Dan Harmon

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
I was making fun of myself

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
while I said that but voting is stupid

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
being gay is fucking great

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
I think I'll suck anybody's dick after the show

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
if you vote for it if you all fucking

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
if there's a fucking plurality

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
I will suck a dick

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
my name is Jim Davis I'll see you after the show

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
I think all gay people

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
where their salt can handle the occasional

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
slip up

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
especially when it's got the red handkerchief

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
on the 2x4

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
of like oops sorry about that

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
I think that's actually better than not saying

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
anything about it

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
I said it in silence because I hate talking about it

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
because what I believe in

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
I don't know how to support it

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
I used to believe in like what

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
Emma Goldman, Mikhail Bakunin

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
Kropotkin and like the great anarchist thinkers

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
that the idea that

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
anarchism is the mother of order

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
it's not disorder

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
the idea that we have to be let around by people

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
that we don't know anything about

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
and these fake structures and shit like that

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
when I start talking about that I bore myself senseless

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
because I don't really know how to support it

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
and then I say something stupid like voting is gay

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
which undercuts everything and people can have a fucking feel

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
and I say hooray you should

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
because I'm a fucking moron

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
but also I just don't like government

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
well this is the thing that drives me nuts about politics

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
is that there's no idealism

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
that we treat idealism

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
the same way that we treat

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
everything else that's actually already going on

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
that I have a big problem with

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
I think that

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
you need to be able to stand at a party

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
and say I think everybody should go

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
should be naked

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
and it shouldn't be held to the same scrutiny

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
if everyone was naked then there wouldn't be pants

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
and if there were no pants

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
let's never think about anything

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
it's really important to soak ourselves

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
in idealism

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
it's not all gonna take

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
but the shit that's already working

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
it's working and it's working too well

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
and it ain't working good enough

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
and we need to constantly

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
be soaking in a solution

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
of idealism

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
we need to have crazy people saying

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
what if we were communists

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
what if there was no government

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
what if garbage was food

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
what if you could turn salt water

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
into fresh water

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
what if we weren't dependent on oil

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
what if the fucking planet is slowly heating up

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
and it's our fault

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
you need to constantly have people

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
if you constantly put everything

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
that those people say under a microscope

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
and bash them to pieces

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
if it doesn't hold up

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
to the same things that have

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
the status quo behind them

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
it's definitely fucked

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
that's called stagnation

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
that's called a tree that doesn't bend

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
it's going to break

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
and uproot and float down the Amazon river

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
alright let's uh

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
soak

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
look at just all stare at me I guess

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
that's what let's do

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
you got any D&D in store for us

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
oh do I

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
yes

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
I wish voting were more gay

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
I guess that's my problem

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
voting is too straight

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
nobody is really offended by that

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
I think you're being too hard on yourself

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
I'm paranoid

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
you're being too hard on yourself

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
you just spoke something and you regretted it

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
there's certain things that we've been saying

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
our whole lives that are now we realize

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
not the right thing to say I think

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
correctly and so sometimes you fall back on old patterns

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
but you caught yourself and that's all that matters

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
the fear is that

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
people continue to not think about it

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
and then just go oh that thing's gay

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
that thing's gay

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
you considered what you said and realized that

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
that was foolish of me

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
but also like

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
what I said

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
what I said was retarded

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
Camille it was totally retarded

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
my sisters retarded

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
is she

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
to beat the band

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
what did you say

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
to beat the band

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
beat the band

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
she's retarded to beat the band

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
what does that mean

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
she's really retarded

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
beat the band means really retarded

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
to beat the band

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
oh fuck that ice cream

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
that was delicious

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
I need that to beat the band

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
it means like

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
explain it to me

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
no Adam

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
you're wrong

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
tell me what it means

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
singing loud enough to beat the band

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
he was yelling to beat the band

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
that makes a lot of sense

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
like out shouting

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
forcefully

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
that makes sense

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
I just found out that hoisted by your own

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
41 years old

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
I've used that expression a million times

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
I always pictured a pitard

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
as a special fancy kind of pants

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
and that being hoisted by your own

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
the pitard meant that your pants were so fancy

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
that it made it easy for people to

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
lift you up

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
and like dangle you

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
I always pictured a fancy guy in a pirate ship

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
going like you pirates are gonna have to

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
get a new way of doing things

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
I'm Mr. Fancy Pants

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
I'm wearing a pitard from now on

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
no blank walking and I'll tell you why

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
and that the pirates go like are you seeing what I'm saying

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
yeah his pitard has like a huge

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
blue bottle

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
and then they hoist him up and he's like

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
whoa whoa whoa

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
I always thought that's what hoisted

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
by your own pitard means

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
a pitard is a bomb

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
hoisted refers to being blown up

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
blown up by your own bomb

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
I think the original appearance in print is like heisted

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
like you're being lifted up in the air

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
by people that were sappers

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
that go to blow up a wall

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
they would put a bomb there frequently

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
they blow themselves up

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
I honestly crazily had the exact same

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
image in my head

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
it was a pirate ship

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
a guy with fancy pants

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
I swear

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
I know I always pictured a guy

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
it's a pole and he's got his pants

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
and he's like

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
but that's where

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
I shouldn't have worn my pitards today

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
don't take a stand

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
if you're wearing a pitard

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
when somebody lifts you up by your collar

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
and your pants and they carry you out

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
that's called walk in Spanish

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
I love that one

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
you just walk Spanish out of a place

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
that's where you get hoisted

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
is that really true?

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
back then Spanish people were

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
they were always flying

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
there's a series of really good books by

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
I think it's Earl Font from Funk and Waggles

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
one's called Heavens to Betsy

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
one's called Horse Feathers

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
one's called Hog on Ice

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
and it's the fourth one I can't remember

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
and it's all the history

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
of etymology

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
of weird phrases

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
where to

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
know the ropes

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
it's the first appearances in print

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
and the titles of all of them are ones that we don't know

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
we don't know why Heavens to Betsy

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
but I love Break a Leg

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
there's lots of different ideas about where Break a Leg came from

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
but it's not like a thing

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
that you wish bad things to happen to actors

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
so good things happen as a superstition

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
to break a leg when you would bow at the end of a show

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
it's where you would get up

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
and crack your back leg

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
and that was being make it to the end

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
make it to the bows

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
because most shows were so shit and the audience

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
would be so angry

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
so they're just saying hopefully you get to the end of the show

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
they're saying don't suck

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
because the groundlings

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
the people that would come and that would stand there

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
they really would bring rotting

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
cabbages and eggs and shit

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
to throw at you because it cost a dime

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
or a nickel or a penny to get into the show

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
and I could be making that dime or nickel

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
out at my stand or doing what I do

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
and so if the show sucks

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
they would just throw shit at you and leave

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
so for an actor to say break a leg

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
it means make it to the bows

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
and I love that

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
but that's up for debate because people say different things

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
why prefer to believe that

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
is that where they throw it?

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
slowly as theater got more and more improved

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
they started to throw fresh produce

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
which became flowers

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
and then panties

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
the freshest of flowers

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
panties

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
I'm John

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
by the time he got in there

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
alright let's do it pretty good

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
play the music

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
are we doing this shit?

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
hang on a second

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
do we not want to?

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
do we need to replace it?

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
no I just did my commercial

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
is Aaron not here?

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
Aaron's not here haven't you seen?

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
do you want somebody to replace it?

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
sure I mean fine

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
I don't care

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
we should get a lady

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
we've got a lot of testosterone up here

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
isn't it great to have three guys

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
there were four guys talking about politics

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
and they bore everybody senseless

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
can we get a gallop up on here to play

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
what's her new character called?

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
Destiny Sars

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
what's the new character?

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
come on up young lady

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
you raise your hand

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
what is your name?

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
Molly

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
Molly the Thing

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
I saw this guy make a very

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
vulgar gesture

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
I was really offended

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
who did?

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
do you need this?

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
who made a vulgar gesture?

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
towards whom?

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
towards you guys

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
the guy here in the yellow shirt

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
Adam what was the gesture?

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
that's the last straw

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
it was like a fuck you but it also involved his other hand

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
to show the full

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
you're jacking off

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
there you go

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
Molly are you new here?

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
this is my second time

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
it's Adam Goldberg he's God's offensive gesture

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
I see

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
he's a human middle finger

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
for your idea God was like

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
fuck you America

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
have this

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
I'm just being serious

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
I'm serious

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
I'm just being serious

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
so

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
are Spencer with this being included in your intro

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
to explain to Kamei what happened

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
with Aaron's character?

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
yeah

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
let's try

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
I don't really think about that stuff

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
me neither

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
I know

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:39.000
there we go

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
when we last met

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
our heroes were in some big danger

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
after what was meant to be

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
a simple dispatching

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
of highwaymen on the road to Rosebook

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
Mulraine Light

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
dead by her own hand

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
and the gnome our heroes aimed to save

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
had a broken neck

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
but before the gang could even catch their breath

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
and mourn their fallen friend

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
a fiery maelstrom of light

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
to escape

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
who levitated the paralyzed gnome to safety

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
in town they met Dignity

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
a paladin with a friendly if pushy demeanor

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
who brought the party to the

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
constabulary

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
to discuss their travels

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
after a spot of tea our gang met Father Tinder

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
a friendly but perverse old abbot

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
in charge of the city

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
Tinder was immediately suspicious of the group

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
but Dignity smoothed things over

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
there is a moment of calm but then

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
Admiral Darkstar still under the skin

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
of Yomiji his heavenly host

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
came blasting through the sky

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
towards the town

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
the powerful fiend assaulted the town

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
but was repelled by Rosebook's

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
powerful defensive magic

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
the ward

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
stood strong

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
but for how long

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
and how long before Father Tinder

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
would learn of the gang's connection

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
to their deadly foe

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
find out this time on an all

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
new installment

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
edition of Harmontown

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
Time

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
so destiny's a paladin

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
that's the new character

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
Dignity

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
that's you

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
I saw the theme

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
I came in on

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
Dignity

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
so Dignity tell us all about yourself

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
I'm

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
I'm immune to sleep

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
I do

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
have an Adderall prescription so

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
that makes sense

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
that's actually useful can I get your number

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
don't met again

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
yeah

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
yeah what are numbers

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
yeah what do you mean

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
alright

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
where are we I wasn't listening

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
why don't you listen

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
I had a fight with Erin and I was listening

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
hey that makes sense

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
probably it's my fault

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
I saw you guys a little while ago

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
and I thought she was coming

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
yeah

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
what happened you guys are going through counseling

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
I know

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
sometimes

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
the counseling gives me new ways

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
to be mean to her

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
like I learned new ways

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
can you have a new vocabulary

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
for abuse

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
bad

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
fiance

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
and I miss her and I'm sorry

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
I'm a bad bad fiance

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
Kay these lights are on

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
I think they're not supposed to be on

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
they came on at some point

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
oh but it's nice

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
it's like we're doing it in a Caribbean

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
bungalow

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
Caribbean bungalow

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
alright so we are

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
what's that image in our head

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
we did a thing we met

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
we're in the consabular

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
the angels trying to get

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
Erin killed her character

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
I saw the killing

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
now she's a new character which by all accounts

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
is the same person just with a different name

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
and a different possible outlook on life

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
but really the same thing

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
I don't know where you're getting that

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
it's not really a great sample size

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
oh just one mission you mean

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
I mean one one episode

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
I'm not saying you're necessarily

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
absolutely wrong I just think it's unjustified

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
it was a small sample

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
that's all I'm saying

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
so now we're in Rosebook right now

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
and is the storm from the Admiral

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
of the Dark Star still approaching

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
you're outside

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
you're looking up he's still

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
in the body of this angel that he's possessed

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
and he's circling around

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
and pounding on the dome like barrier

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
around the city

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
he can't get in though it seems

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
oh yeah

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
looks like he's trying to get in

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
should probably go check on those soul rods

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
make sure they're

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
holding up

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
okay

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
so those are the perimeter so you want to go check those out

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
I'd like to go check out the soul rods

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
you okay Sharpie

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
you seem a little down

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
yeah I'm alright

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
I'm alright

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
alright I'll go check out the soul rods

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
you go to the nearest

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
nearest soul rod it seems

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
to be strictly reinforced

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
there's a cleric he's praying and his hands

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
are outstretched kind of like

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
washing over the rod

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
with his magical energies

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
he's kind of keeping it powered

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
hey hey you need any help

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
he doesn't respond

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
hey I'm talking to you

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
he's chanting under his breath

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
back pitch that set up on fire

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
no no no

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
I'm doing a bit

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
I was doing a bit

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
I was doing a bit

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
see you later good job praying

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
so these soul rods

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
the city's protected by

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
it's powered by prayers

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
and magic

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
right if you listen

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
you can hear

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
there must be five in the morning

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
what

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
I just set my pen down and I played a song

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
his pen plays to Sunia

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
alright

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
okay so

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
so you're at this soul rod

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
or you're trying to talk to this guy

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
he's not responding

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
but as you're talking to him

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
you hear the squeaking of a wooden cart

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
and you turn and you see Father Tinder

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
he's pushing a wooden cart full of

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
kegs and growlers

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
and glasses and cups

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
he's got all this juice

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
he's in his cart and he's pushing it along

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
and he's like

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
now everybody keep calm

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000
our wards have never failed us against

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
evil and they won't now

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000
not as long as we hold strong

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
now who wants juice

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
he hands a juice to the cleric

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
who kind of wordlessly grabs it

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
and puts it in his pocket without breaking his incantation

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000
what kind of juice is it

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
all sorts of juice we got

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000
orange juice and grape juice

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
I guess it's just two kinds of juice

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
what does the juice do

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
it uh you know

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
good for the nerves it's wholesome

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
it's wholesome I uh I asked

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
for a growler of juice he gives you

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
he gives you a skin instead

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
a wine skin but of juice

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
I asked for a fucking growler

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
hey man hey hey come on man

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
can I get a goblet of grape juice

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
I have a wooden cup

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000
it looks like a goblet

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
I'll take just a portion of juice

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000
take it around the corner

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000
and do a little

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000
I follow them and we're gonna

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000
I have knowledge arcana

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
yep 13

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000
alright that's the first thing

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000
I'm just dribbling it on my fingers

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000
and I'm like checking it out

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000
yeah I'm gonna do sense motive on it

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
it seems to want to

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000
be drank I guess

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000
I use perception on it

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
to see what the deal is

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000
it looks like juice

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000
okay

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000
because it's been a long day

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000
I go guys I'm a gnome

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
I'm pretty tough I'm a barbarian

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
I'll just I'll drink

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000
I'll take a sip of the juice

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000
come on man come on that's not the

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
thing of it

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
he's a juice dealer

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000
he's I think that's

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
I honestly think that

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000
you think this is a bad idea?

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000
yeah because I think the worst case scenario

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000
is you go Jim Jones

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000
like

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000
Jones town participant

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000
best case scenario is you don't

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
and then who cares

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000
you know what I mean

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
it's high risk low yield

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000
either nothing happens that's not interesting

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000
or you die

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000
okay so there's no way to win

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000
I don't drink it Spencer

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
but I walk back to Father Tender

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000
at the juice cart

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000
and I say oh thank you that was

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000
delicious and I look at him

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
expectantly

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
okay

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
what do the rest of you guys do in the doorway?

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
I can detect evil should I

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
detect if the juice is evil?

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
I should have waited for you to do

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000
yeah the juice it's not evil

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000
okay

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000
you know what I'm going to put it down on the ground

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
and I have stealth 13

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
I'm going to sneak up to the juice

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
I'm pretty sure we can drink this juice safely

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
I mean

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
I'm not getting a bad vibe off this juice

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000
what about my knowledge Arcana

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000
well no I got caught up

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
in other things I guess

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
you use your knowledge of Arcana

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
to find out that it's not magical

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000
it only extends

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000
to your knowledge of magic which this is not

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
alright it might be chemical

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
alright

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000
what about my brew potion feet

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000
doesn't that mean that I can see a

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000
Mickey when I see one?

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
well potions are magical so

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000
your mama's magical

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000
I wish

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000
that'd be amazing

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000

I always have juice it's my secret juice

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000
and what would you say

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000
it's major property

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000
you know I'm feeling pretty

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000
pretty good but major property

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
I go up to him and I go

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
and I come in pretending to be under

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
juice is commanding me to

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000
do stuff

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000

I don't I don't want to be rude

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
but I sense that you're deceiving me right now

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
alright okay

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
you're right you call it

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000
alright it's a little thing we do

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
when people offer us juice

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000
we've been to a lot of towns

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
it's just juice it's just juice

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000
we call this due diligence

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000
we are

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000
we call it juice diligence

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
I bet when you were our age you

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000
tested juice before you drank it

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000
I mean we see a site juice all the time

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
he said he's got a force field around it

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000
the juice should be suspicious

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
we're gonna drink it

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000
I drink my juice

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000
I'm gonna put mine in my pocket

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000
put mine in my pocket

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000
I drink my juice

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000
I give mine to the robot baby

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
you give your juice to the robot baby

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000
you put it in your pocket

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.000
I drink my juice

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000
I'm gonna turn mine into water

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
uh wait

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
how do you do that

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000
it says divine favor

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000
I think you can create water

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.000
but not turn stuff into it

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000
I'm sorry I'm sorry to disappoint you

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000
I feel like we really

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000
got stuck in this juice thing

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
I think the Kool-Aid

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
man just came by and we got all freaked out

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000
he has

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000
a force field over his city

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000
he runs the place like Charles Manson

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
he's creepy

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000
he sexually harasses his female under legs

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000
and he brings juice around

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000
we were right to check the juice out

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000
sorry I hope you didn't hear any of that

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000
I mean yeah I'm pretty perceptive

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000
I drink my juice

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000
and I try to sense

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000
any ill effects or positive effects from it

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000
it tastes a bit bitter

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000
like it has orange rind in it

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000
you know some people don't like it

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000

demon angel

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000
as long as god's favors on my side

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
he pats a

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
he pats a pocket on his chest

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000
he reveals no pocket where he was padding

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
nothing in the juice

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000
why do you think there's stuff in the juice

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000
yeah you kind of run things in a

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000
autonomistic way

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000

can I get to a shot of wheatgrass what's

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
wheatgrass alright I guess that answers

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000
the question

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000
here we go to the juicery

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000
look at that building oh yeah

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000
you could ride the horse

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000
but you get there way before everyone else

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000
that's fine alright

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000
hey when was that building made

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000
I pointed to buildings I don't know

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000
what's that building do that's a

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
the house who was born there

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
I don't I don't know that anyone was

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000
where's the juicery born there

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000
it's right here

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
are we at the juicery

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
there are how far is it

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
are you scrubbing the juicery right now

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
sounds like it

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
alright oh

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000
here we are

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000
the sense of anticipation

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000
do we just walk in

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000
no standing outside

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000
standing outside of the juicery

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
it looks like a knight who

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000
seems like he's been standing there a while

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000
and he also seems like he's been drinking

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000
it's a juice knight

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000
drinking juice

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000
no no he seems drunk I should say

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000
oh what's your knight's name

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000
oh that's darm von

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000
hey

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
it feels like what that name makes me think

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
we weren't supposed to come to the juicery

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000
that feels like a name that was thought of

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000
when the sentence was started

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000
if we die

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000
outside of a juicery I'd be very disappointed

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000
so darm von

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000
darm von step aside matey

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000
we're going to go inside and see how the juice is made

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000
just like one second

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
I just want to talk to father

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000
that sounds fine gentlemen

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000
if you give us a bit of privacy

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000
oh privacy we didn't say we would give you privacy

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000
this happen

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000
I think everyone's allowed to hear everything

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
no let him hear it

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000
let him hear it

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
father

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000
darm von said that

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000
okay great

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.000
darm von

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.000
you know why

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000
there's demon things here

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000
and you can stop it father

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000
and father tender is like

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000
I don't know what you're talking about man

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000
this guy's crazy he's like a heretic

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000
or something

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000
and darm von is like here you fucking

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000
you

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000
you got to listen

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000
you got to give it up otherwise

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000
he's going to kill us all you got to give it up

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000
and father tender is like

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000
I don't know I don't know what you're talking about

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000
can you guys help me out

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000
I'm glad we listened to this conversation

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000
father tender he's like this guy's crazy

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000
well we want to hear what he has to say

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000
he's crazy we'll just dismiss it

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000
so a lot of times alcohol just releases the inhibitions

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000
I mean it doesn't mean that everybody's saying

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000
alcohol is evil

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.000
he's not going to kill us all

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000
he's mad on alcohol

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000
you can't silence dissent

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000
let's hear it out

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.000
that's how stagnation breathes

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000
pretty soon you're going to have juice tanks

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000
rolling up and down the streets

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000
if you won't

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000
if you won't give it up I'm going to take it

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000
from you and give it up

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000
myself

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000
what does give it up mean

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000
what's it called

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.000
he

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000
he draws his sword quickly

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000
and moves that

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.000
and moves towards father tender

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000
what do you do

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000
I fucking stand back

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000
and watch what's about to happen

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
I go and I get in the way

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000
and I'm like hey knight

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000
tell us what you mean darvon

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000
please don't attack let's use our words

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000
it's what separates us from animals

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000
so he lunges

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000
he lunges at you

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000
because you step into his path

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000
I have my hands are up

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.000
your hands are up

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000
and he slips and he falls

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.000
and he impales himself on his own sword

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000
it's a critical fail

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000
and

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:21.000
the life pulses out of him

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.000
as he bleeds onto the floor

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.000
father tender goes that's fucked up

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000
that will

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000
that will remain a mystery
