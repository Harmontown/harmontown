And you talk to anybody that was working class like, it's happening.\n\n03:38.000 --> 03:41.000\nAnd it was gonna happen.\n\n03:41.000 --> 03:47.000\nWell, yeah, and we get, I'm to the election, I'll be permeating tonight as a theme, I'm sure.\n\n03:47.000 --> 03:50.000\nIncluding the analysis of the statistics and stuff.\n\n03:50.000 --> 03:59.000\nBut I, to me, what I am keen to talk about, because it's most scary, most promising, most exciting to me,\n\n03:59.000 --> 04:06.000\nis the cultural, not ramifications, but the cultural thing that's happening,\n\n04:06.000 --> 04:09.000\nof which I think this election is a symptom.\n\n04:09.000 --> 04:15.000\nBecause it's a real thing that we have to deal with on our sidewalks and things,\n\n04:15.000 --> 04:21.000\nand in conversations with each other, the people with actual human hearts and brains that we touch,\n\n04:21.000 --> 04:26.000\nand whose breath we can smell, and who are renting properties to or from us,\n\n04:26.000 --> 04:30.000\nand who we buy and sell bread to.\n\n04:30.000 --> 04:35.000\nI haven't been into the market in a while, and I don't know how commerce works.\n\n04:35.000 --> 04:37.000\nI pay people to count my filthy money.\n\n04:37.000 --> 04:44.000\nBut the human beings are neighbors and things, and douchebags.\n\n04:44.000 --> 04:51.000\nWe know that our friend Kumeil had an incident at a bar.\n\n04:51.000 --> 04:59.000\nThese young douches that got drunk, and they were like...\n\n04:59.000 --> 05:04.000\nI guess it turns out later, in the analysis afterward of this story,\n\n05:04.000 --> 05:10.000\nthe bartender was filling them in and saying that they have alt-right meetings over at this certain bar.\n\n05:10.000 --> 05:15.000\nI guess I won't name, because I'm not sure what I'd be doing by naming the bar,\n\n05:15.000 --> 05:20.000\nbut that they have alt-right meetings in the back room, and that this is a bar close by,\n\n05:20.000 --> 05:24.000\nand that one of those two guys had been there before.\n\n05:24.000 --> 05:29.000\nIt's not like Clockwork Orange, where it's like, holy shit, the fabric of society is changing necessarily,\n\n05:29.000 --> 05:31.000\njust because of that story.\n\n05:31.000 --> 05:35.000\nBut in case you didn't see it, the story was that Kumeil and Thomas Middleton were hanging out at a bar,\n\n05:35.000 --> 05:39.000\nand two guys that had been drinking for a couple hours came up to them and said,\n\n05:39.000 --> 05:43.000\nhey, we're big fans, and I disagree with what you say on Twitter about Trump,\n\n05:43.000 --> 05:46.000\nand then they said, let's not talk about politics.\n\n05:46.000 --> 05:51.000\nAnd they said, what are you, a cock, cock, cock, cock? And they started chanting the word cock,\n\n05:51.000 --> 05:54.000\nwhich, if that's going to happen, I...\n\n05:54.000 --> 06:00.000\nI didn't know that that was an alt-right term for people that have been, what, cuckolded by politics?\n\n06:00.000 --> 06:02.000\nLike, what is the angle on that?\n\n06:02.000 --> 06:05.000\nIt's just an attack on, I think, masculinity.\n\n06:05.000 --> 06:07.000\nOh, that you're not a man.\n\n06:07.000 --> 06:09.000\nYou're just like a beta male.\n\n06:09.000 --> 06:14.000\nI think it's more of a beta male thing to really focus on the sex life of other people.\n\n06:14.000 --> 06:20.000\nBut again, I don't know if you've seen cuckold porn, but there's this guy, Marcello,\n\n06:20.000 --> 06:24.000\nwho's a cuckold who is very alpha.\n\n06:24.000 --> 06:30.000\nHe fucking like, he cuckolds himself so much that he owns the room.\n\n06:30.000 --> 06:35.000\nLike, I got no beef with a guy that's so low status,\n\n06:35.000 --> 06:39.000\nhe can suck another man's penis while that man fucks his wife.\n\n06:39.000 --> 06:43.000\nLike, I think that guy's pretty fucking intimidating.\n\n06:43.000 --> 06:48.000\nAnd she goes like, lick my balls, slave, and he's like,\n\n06:48.000 --> 06:51.000\nand his eyes are just dead.\n\n06:51.000 --> 06:56.000\nAnd I'm like, this fucking guy, like, I'm following him into battle.\n\n06:56.000 --> 07:00.000\nNot somebody who's like, what'd you say?\n\n07:00.000 --> 07:03.000\nLike, this guy's cool under fire.\n\n07:03.000 --> 07:05.000\nHe's licking balls.\n\n07:05.000 --> 07:08.000\nYou're not supposed to want to do that if a guy's fucking your wife.\n\n07:08.000 --> 07:10.000\nThat's the last thing.\n\n07:10.000 --> 07:13.000\nYou know, he's topping from the bottom, though. Like, he likes it.\n\n07:13.000 --> 07:14.000\nLike, he's in charge.\n\n07:14.000 --> 07:16.000\nHe's eating the world from hell.\n\n07:16.000 --> 07:18.000\nYeah, I don't know what you're talking about.\n\n07:18.000 --> 07:19.000\nHe's amazing.\n\n07:19.000 --> 07:20.000\nHe's my hero in that.\n\n07:20.000 --> 07:22.000\nI just did a comedy show last night.\n\n07:22.000 --> 07:26.000\nThe gig was in Escondido, California, kind of down San Diego way,\n\n07:26.000 --> 07:28.000\nlike South of Carlsbad.\n\n07:28.000 --> 07:32.000\nBut we stayed in Rancho Santa Fe, which is quite rich and white.\n\n07:32.000 --> 07:36.000\nAnd I went to have breakfast or lunch yesterday,\n\n07:36.000 --> 07:40.000\nand there was this woman that came in, and she was like, very Orange County,\n\n07:40.000 --> 07:46.000\nlike, you know, I'd just picture a wealthy Orange County middle-aged woman\n\n07:46.000 --> 07:48.000\nwho was pretending to be 19.\n\n07:48.000 --> 07:51.000\nAnd she was quite loud, and they were all talking about Chardonnay\n\n07:51.000 --> 07:53.000\nand varietals of grapes, because they're all wine people.\n\n07:53.000 --> 07:54.000\nAnd it was fine.\n\n07:54.000 --> 07:56.000\nI was reading my book, so I was pissed off.\n\n07:56.000 --> 08:00.000\nBut that's my fault for reading a book at a bar and expecting silence.\n\n08:00.000 --> 08:01.000\nAnd then she started talking.\n\n08:01.000 --> 08:04.000\nI thought you hated yourself for reading, or...\n\n08:04.000 --> 08:08.000\nI thought you were going, and here I am reading.\n\n08:08.000 --> 08:11.000\nI like reading alone at a bar or at a restaurant,\n\n08:11.000 --> 08:15.000\nand I expect graveyard silence, which is self-destructive.\n\n08:15.000 --> 08:16.000\nIt's stupid.\n\n08:16.000 --> 08:18.000\nBut I do bring earplugs, but then I'm like,\n\n08:18.000 --> 08:20.000\nI'm not wearing earplugs in a bar.\n\n08:20.000 --> 08:22.000\nEverybody has a right to look at me and go,\n\n08:22.000 --> 08:24.000\nthis guy is a fucking piece of shit.\n\n08:24.000 --> 08:26.000\nAnd I can dig it.\n\n08:26.000 --> 08:29.000\nBut it was totally silent for the first 45 minutes I was there.\n\n08:29.000 --> 08:31.000\nThen this woman came and was talking to two other people,\n\n08:31.000 --> 08:33.000\nand they were talking about grapes and wines,\n\n08:33.000 --> 08:35.000\nand then she's like, oh, my daughter's got married,\n\n08:35.000 --> 08:37.000\nand so my son-in-law is so amazing.\n\n08:37.000 --> 08:38.000\nHe's a marine.\n\n08:38.000 --> 08:40.000\nAnd they have a dog, and the dog is named Mary,\n\n08:40.000 --> 08:42.000\nbut she's short for America.\n\n08:42.000 --> 08:49.000\nAnd I was, as I drove down there, when you pass the orange curtain,\n\n08:49.000 --> 08:51.000\nwhen you get down into good and proper Orange County,\n\n08:51.000 --> 08:54.000\nit's Trump stickers and forward F-150s and all that jazz.\n\n08:54.000 --> 08:59.000\nBut then they all started talking in hushed tones about politics, about the election.\n\n08:59.000 --> 09:01.000\nThey were all Hillary people.\n\n09:01.000 --> 09:03.000\nThey sounded like they were going to be Trumpies.\n\n09:03.000 --> 09:06.000\nBut then I heard another guy, later on, football was on,\n\n09:06.000 --> 09:10.000\na white guy with his white girlfriend or wife,\n\n09:10.000 --> 09:12.000\nand an interception happened.\n\n09:12.000 --> 09:15.000\nAnd he yelled, oh, god damn, are you fucking monkey?\n\n09:15.000 --> 09:17.000\nAnd I was the only one that heard it.\n\n09:17.000 --> 09:20.000\nAnd I just turned my mind, whoa!\n\n09:20.000 --> 09:22.000\nAnd he goes, oh, whoa, whoa, why do you assume\n\n09:22.000 --> 09:24.000\nI was talking about an African-American?\n\n09:24.000 --> 09:26.000\nI said, whoa!\n\n09:26.000 --> 09:28.000\nDouble, whoa!\n\n09:28.000 --> 09:30.000\nThat's a meadow, whoa!\n\n09:30.000 --> 09:32.000\nWhoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!\n\n09:32.000 --> 09:35.000\nAnd I said, I'm watching the same TV you are, man.\n\n09:35.000 --> 09:38.000\nAnd he goes, you fucking jackass.\n\n09:38.000 --> 09:40.000\nHe mutters to his wife, he's a fucking jackass.\n\n09:40.000 --> 09:42.000\nWhat other words are you going to take away from us?\n\n09:42.000 --> 09:44.000\nYeah.\n\n09:44.000 --> 09:48.000\nSo then I said, oh, I'm going to guess you voted for Trump.\n\n09:48.000 --> 09:50.000\nHe goes, no, we voted for Hillary.\n\n09:50.000 --> 09:51.000\nExactly.\n\n09:51.000 --> 09:52.000\nSo, thank you.\n\n09:52.000 --> 09:54.000\nHe felt activated, I felt.\n\n09:54.000 --> 09:56.000\nI feel that.\n\n09:56.000 --> 09:58.000\nI'm not Kumail Nanjiani, and I'm not brown.\n\n09:58.000 --> 10:01.000\nAnd I didn't get poked in my chest by some, you know,\n\n10:01.000 --> 10:03.000\nsome alt-right weirdos.\n\n10:03.000 --> 10:06.000\nI just feel like that was the first time I've ever heard,\n\n10:06.000 --> 10:09.000\nlike a bunch of, somebody felt that comfortable\n\n10:09.000 --> 10:10.000\nto yell that out.\n\n10:10.000 --> 10:13.000\nAnd also, strangely righteous indignation when I,\n\n10:13.000 --> 10:15.000\nlike, I didn't go, hey, fuck you, racist!\n\n10:15.000 --> 10:16.000\nI didn't say that.\n\n10:16.000 --> 10:17.000\nI went like, wow!\n\n10:17.000 --> 10:18.000\nRight.\n\n10:18.000 --> 10:20.000\nAnd he's fucking racist in his head.\n\n10:20.000 --> 10:23.000\nSo that's what I want to talk about tonight.\n\n10:23.000 --> 10:25.000\nI'm very proud of myself.\n\n10:25.000 --> 10:27.000\nI lined up some guests that are not based on like,\n\n10:27.000 --> 10:29.000\noh, this person represents this, that.\n\n10:29.000 --> 10:31.000\nIn keeping with that, I invited random people\n\n10:31.000 --> 10:33.000\nthat I came across.\n\n10:33.000 --> 10:35.000\nThey better be all white males.\n\n10:35.000 --> 10:36.000\nThey aren't.\n\n10:36.000 --> 10:39.000\nBut I do, before we, I do want to say before we,\n\n10:39.000 --> 10:42.000\nbecause tonight is going to be, if I have anything to do with it,\n\n10:42.000 --> 10:46.000\nit's about moving forward into, like, I don't care.\n\n10:46.000 --> 10:48.000\nDon't, if you're listening to this and you're offended\n\n10:48.000 --> 10:50.000\nby a straight white dude saying,\n\n10:50.000 --> 10:53.000\nwe need to erase the lines and solidaries,\n\n10:53.000 --> 10:56.000\nnot kidding us anywhere, I'm not telling you\n\n10:56.000 --> 11:03.000\nnot to see lines, and I'm going to express that\n\n11:03.000 --> 11:06.000\nwhere I'm at and how I'm going to move forward\n\n11:06.000 --> 11:10.000\nthe best way I think I can help and use my I statements.\n\n11:10.000 --> 11:14.000\nI am certainly not here to tell, particularly especially\n\n11:14.000 --> 11:18.000\nthe last person I want to tell not to see things in lines\n\n11:18.000 --> 11:21.000\nare the black women in our family tonight,\n\n11:21.000 --> 11:24.000\nbecause I feel like that was an astounding,\n\n11:24.000 --> 11:26.000\nalmost comedically absurd story.\n\n11:26.000 --> 11:28.000\nLike, if you looked at the statistics\n\n11:28.000 --> 11:31.000\nand you were looking at lines and how they broke down,\n\n11:31.000 --> 11:33.000\nthat was a bummer.\n\n11:33.000 --> 11:37.000\nLike, they lined up and they were like, yep,\n\n11:37.000 --> 11:40.000\nwhat you see is what you get, voting for Hillary,\n\n11:40.000 --> 11:43.000\nshe's not, she's a woman and I'm a woman\n\n11:43.000 --> 11:46.000\nand there's a million reasons, blah, blah, blah,\n\n11:46.000 --> 11:49.000\nand they came home and it's like, let's get our lady,\n\n11:49.000 --> 11:55.000\nwhat the fuck, you honky bitches.\n\n11:55.000 --> 11:59.000\n42% of the women vote went for Trump, is that right?\n\n11:59.000 --> 12:01.000\nYeah, I don't even know.\n\n12:01.000 --> 12:05.000\nWe've all seen the spreadsheets that have befuddled us,\n\n12:05.000 --> 12:09.000\nand then we searched for meeting with our primate mind.\n\n12:09.000 --> 12:11.000\nI trusted Jake Tapper.\n\n12:11.000 --> 12:13.000\nYou lied.\n\n12:13.000 --> 12:15.000\nI think the message from those spreadsheets,\n\n12:15.000 --> 12:17.000\nfrom this election, from everything,\n\n12:17.000 --> 12:19.000\nwas going like, oh, thank God,\n\n12:19.000 --> 12:23.000\nit may be in a very twisted, horrible balloon animal way,\n\n12:23.000 --> 12:26.000\nbut Martin Luther King finally just actually became,\n\n12:26.000 --> 12:28.000\nhis dream is actually becoming a little bit true,\n\n12:28.000 --> 12:32.000\nbecause I cannot look at anybody anymore\n\n12:32.000 --> 12:35.000\nor think about anybody based on any group that they belong to\n\n12:35.000 --> 12:37.000\nand assume anything about them.\n\n12:37.000 --> 12:40.000\nI think that election, it's like,\n\n12:40.000 --> 12:43.000\nyou can now say that you have more in common\n\n12:43.000 --> 12:45.000\nwith a person you haven't met yet\n\n12:45.000 --> 12:46.000\nthan some of the people you've met.\n\n12:46.000 --> 12:49.000\nYou can now say that you have more important things in common\n\n12:49.000 --> 12:52.000\nwith people who have superficial things not in common with you,\n\n12:52.000 --> 12:57.000\nand I don't want to speak for my people that are shaped like me,\n\n12:57.000 --> 13:01.000\nbut before that Tuesday, I was walking around thinking that\n\n13:01.000 --> 13:05.000\nthe idea that biology didn't matter, race, gender,\n\n13:05.000 --> 13:07.000\nto name a few bio lines,\n\n13:07.000 --> 13:09.000\nthere's a million of them though,\n\n13:09.000 --> 13:11.000\nthe things that just make us different,\n\n13:11.000 --> 13:13.000\nlike in the goo that makes up our body.\n\n13:13.000 --> 13:16.000\nThe idea that that stuff didn't matter,\n\n13:16.000 --> 13:18.000\nI always looked at it like broccoli,\n\n13:18.000 --> 13:21.000\nlike really healthy, really hard to commit to,\n\n13:21.000 --> 13:23.000\nlike not the first choice,\n\n13:23.000 --> 13:27.000\nlike when I'm secretly thinking about what I'd rather do,\n\n13:27.000 --> 13:29.000\nlike kind of difficult, worth it,\n\n13:29.000 --> 13:31.000\nwe'll make everything better,\n\n13:31.000 --> 13:35.000\noh so hard to do and no one else is going to do it anyway.\n\n13:35.000 --> 13:40.000\nAnd after Tuesday, like I swear it's not hyperbole,\n\n13:40.000 --> 13:42.000\nit was just like the one good thing for me,\n\n13:42.000 --> 13:45.000\nwas I was like holy shit no,\n\n13:45.000 --> 13:49.000\nthe idea that you can't tell what people are thinking or feeling\n\n13:49.000 --> 13:51.000\nor where they're coming from by looking at them,\n\n13:51.000 --> 13:54.000\nis not like broccoli, it's like air,\n\n13:54.000 --> 13:58.000\nit's impossible now to not be in that mindset,\n\n13:58.000 --> 14:02.000\nit's absolutely vital and it's relatively empty\n\n14:02.000 --> 14:04.000\nand we have to fill it with something meaningful.\n\n14:04.000 --> 14:07.000\nI know that was a dumb way to extend that metaphor,\n\n14:07.000 --> 14:08.000\nI should have stopped that,\n\n14:08.000 --> 14:10.000\nit just went from being like,\n\n14:10.000 --> 14:12.000\noh you should really do that, okay I will,\n\n14:12.000 --> 14:14.000\nand walking around like that monkey guy,\n\n14:14.000 --> 14:18.000\nwho clearly was yelling at himself before you did,\n\n14:18.000 --> 14:20.000\nhe was yelling at all this shit,\n\n14:20.000 --> 14:22.000\nyou were yelling at him for being a resident,\n\n14:22.000 --> 14:24.000\nthat guy's already, we got this fucking\n\n14:24.000 --> 14:27.000\nWorld Wrestling Federation wrapped up in our brains\n\n14:27.000 --> 14:29.000\nbecause we're surrounded by it anyway,\n\n14:29.000 --> 14:32.000\nso the big question becomes,\n\n14:32.000 --> 14:37.000\nhow do we stop being surprised by shit,\n\n14:37.000 --> 14:40.000\nhow do we, that was my therapist's advice,\n\n14:40.000 --> 14:42.000\nstop expressing yourself with like,\n\n14:42.000 --> 14:44.000\nDan you keep going like this,\n\n14:44.000 --> 14:46.000\nand your voice keeps going up in the air,\n\n14:46.000 --> 14:47.000\nbecause you keep going,\n\n14:47.000 --> 14:49.000\nthere's a swastikop over the house in San Francisco,\n\n14:49.000 --> 14:51.000\ncan you believe what you did to you,\n\n14:51.000 --> 14:54.000\nand the white women that you knew I was?\n\n14:54.000 --> 14:58.000\nIt's all in that context of can you fucking believe it,\n\n14:58.000 --> 14:59.000\ncan you believe it,\n\n14:59.000 --> 15:01.000\nand you hear that story about Camille,\n\n15:01.000 --> 15:03.000\nand that always the unspoken thing on Twitter\n\n15:03.000 --> 15:05.000\nis like when you retweet stuff,\n\n15:05.000 --> 15:08.000\nyou do, the unspoken message of it is like,\n\n15:08.000 --> 15:09.000\ncan you believe this,\n\n15:09.000 --> 15:14.000\nand that for the last 20 years has been enough,\n\n15:14.000 --> 15:17.000\nlike that has been our definition of the guillotine,\n\n15:17.000 --> 15:19.000\nit's been our definition of like,\n\n15:19.000 --> 15:21.000\njust like transparency,\n\n15:21.000 --> 15:23.000\nof rule of law socially,\n\n15:23.000 --> 15:25.000\nbecause there are no laws against like,\n\n15:25.000 --> 15:30.000\nhaving weird feelings about you ate three bananas,\n\n15:30.000 --> 15:31.000\nnow you're a woman,\n\n15:31.000 --> 15:33.000\nyou can have like these fucked up ideas\n\n15:33.000 --> 15:35.000\nthat if a Supreme Court justice has them,\n\n15:35.000 --> 15:38.000\nbananas, illegal, and we're like, whoa, hey,\n\n15:38.000 --> 15:41.000\nthose thoughts aren't illegal,\n\n15:41.000 --> 15:45.000\nand so we have up until now had the luxury of going,\n\n15:45.000 --> 15:49.000\ncan you believe this person feels this way?\n\n15:49.000 --> 15:51.000\nNow it seems clear to me that it's like,\n\n15:51.000 --> 15:53.000\noh, you gotta believe it,\n\n15:53.000 --> 15:54.000\nyou gotta believe it,\n\n15:54.000 --> 15:56.000\nand coming with that is like,\n\n15:56.000 --> 15:58.000\nthen if you're going like this,\n\n15:58.000 --> 16:00.000\nyou're the sucker,\n\n16:00.000 --> 16:03.000\nlike can you believe this guy's mugging me?\n\n16:03.000 --> 16:05.000\nWell, yeah, Steven Segal can,\n\n16:05.000 --> 16:07.000\nthat's why he's not getting mugged anymore.\n\n16:07.000 --> 16:08.000\nWhat a terrible example,\n\n16:08.000 --> 16:10.000\nyou guys don't admire Steven Segal?\n\n16:10.000 --> 16:12.000\nI'm 43, he was like really,\n\n16:12.000 --> 16:14.000\nhe was bad ass,\n\n16:14.000 --> 16:18.000\nfor like six months of 92, I think.\n\n16:18.000 --> 16:20.000\nI couldn't think of a name of a guy\n\n16:20.000 --> 16:22.000\nwho's famous for not getting mugged.\n\n16:22.000 --> 16:25.000\nWhat, I forget,\n\n16:25.000 --> 16:26.000\nmaybe I remember,\n\n16:26.000 --> 16:28.000\nI'm not sure if I know the exact order\n\n16:28.000 --> 16:30.000\nof the five stages of grief,\n\n16:30.000 --> 16:32.000\nbut do you know which Spencer or Dan,\n\n16:32.000 --> 16:34.000\ndo you know which one you're in right now?\n\n16:34.000 --> 16:35.000\nWell, I'm,\n\n16:35.000 --> 16:37.000\nI'm gonna assume not acceptance yet.\n\n16:37.000 --> 16:40.000\nWell, or you could say either this grief doesn't apply\n\n16:40.000 --> 16:43.000\nor I'm all the way to acceptance\n\n16:43.000 --> 16:45.000\nbecause we need to do more than grief.\n\n16:45.000 --> 16:47.000\nIf our friend is getting harassed in a bar,\n\n16:47.000 --> 16:49.000\nwe don't have to go grab our muskets,\n\n16:49.000 --> 16:50.000\nwe don't have to go,\n\n16:50.000 --> 16:52.000\nbecause we don't know those guys represent the alt-right,\n\n16:52.000 --> 16:54.000\nwe don't know what the alt-right is,\n\n16:54.000 --> 16:56.000\nwe don't know, we just, we have to,\n\n16:56.000 --> 16:58.000\nwe have to straighten our backs,\n\n16:58.000 --> 16:59.000\nsquare our shoulders,\n\n16:59.000 --> 17:01.000\ntake a deep breath in, go,\n\n17:01.000 --> 17:02.000\nthis is happening.\n\n17:02.000 --> 17:05.000\nLike, like, there are skinheads,\n\n17:05.000 --> 17:07.000\nthere are angry people,\n\n17:07.000 --> 17:09.000\nthere are people you can't,\n\n17:09.000 --> 17:12.000\nevery person that is walking toward you,\n\n17:12.000 --> 17:15.000\nit has either dynamite\n\n17:15.000 --> 17:17.000\nor pudding,\n\n17:17.000 --> 17:19.000\nor pudding being a good thing,\n\n17:19.000 --> 17:21.000\nlike the opposite of dynamite.\n\n17:21.000 --> 17:23.000\nBut it's a bad thing to have in your head\n\n17:23.000 --> 17:25.000\nbecause you need to think.\n\n17:25.000 --> 17:27.000\nSo, again, my metaphors are failing,\n\n17:27.000 --> 17:29.000\nbut I'm saying every person that you encounter\n\n17:29.000 --> 17:31.000\ncould be explosive,\n\n17:31.000 --> 17:33.000\nor a god, or a monster,\n\n17:33.000 --> 17:35.000\nbut very likely something\n\n17:35.000 --> 17:37.000\nincredibly sloppy and unpredictable\n\n17:37.000 --> 17:39.000\nin between that is going to require,\n\n17:39.000 --> 17:42.000\nlike, very, very,\n\n17:42.000 --> 17:45.000\nlike, in the moment negotiation\n\n17:45.000 --> 17:47.000\nand also, though, before you enter\n\n17:47.000 --> 17:49.000\nthat chaotic world,\n\n17:49.000 --> 17:51.000\nan agreement about how we behave,\n\n17:51.000 --> 17:53.000\nfor instance, when I've seen some pictograms\n\n17:53.000 --> 17:56.000\nthat were being posted that I thought were kind of cool,\n\n17:56.000 --> 17:59.000\nit's like, what do you do when you see\n\n17:59.000 --> 18:02.000\na dude bullying a Muslim woman on a subway\n\n18:02.000 --> 18:03.000\nand it, like, shows you in pictograms,\n\n18:03.000 --> 18:04.000\nlike, what you should do?\n\n18:04.000 --> 18:05.000\nIt turns out what you should do\n\n18:05.000 --> 18:06.000\nis walk up to the Muslim woman,\n\n18:06.000 --> 18:08.000\nstart hanging out with her\n\n18:08.000 --> 18:09.000\nas if the guy doesn't exist,\n\n18:09.000 --> 18:11.000\nand as if you've known her for 20 years.\n\n18:11.000 --> 18:12.000\nHey, how are you?\n\n18:12.000 --> 18:14.000\nI haven't seen you in a while.\n\n18:14.000 --> 18:16.000\nI mean, probably, you know,\n\n18:16.000 --> 18:18.000\nit's better than going like,\n\n18:18.000 --> 18:20.000\nget your hands off her!\n\n18:20.000 --> 18:24.000\nI got sidetracked by that.\n\n18:24.000 --> 18:26.000\nAre you saying, I mean, yeah,\n\n18:26.000 --> 18:28.000\nI mean, we should all, like,\n\n18:28.000 --> 18:30.000\nif I saw someone doing that,\n\n18:30.000 --> 18:31.000\nI would absolutely go up there\n\n18:31.000 --> 18:32.000\nand intervene and step in\n\n18:32.000 --> 18:35.000\nat the risk of getting, like, punched, like...\n\n18:35.000 --> 18:36.000\nWell, I...\n\n18:36.000 --> 18:37.000\nBut the thing is, I don't know,\n\n18:37.000 --> 18:39.000\nI would piss my pants and cry\n\n18:39.000 --> 18:40.000\nand so I want to talk to people\n\n18:40.000 --> 18:41.000\nwho don't know how,\n\n18:41.000 --> 18:43.000\nit's like, I feel like you're bragging.\n\n18:43.000 --> 18:47.000\nWell, no, I mean,\n\n18:47.000 --> 18:49.000\nI'm saying hypothetically because\n\n18:49.000 --> 18:51.000\nit's always been a hypothetical.\n\n18:51.000 --> 18:53.000\nNow, I don't think it's going to keep\n\n18:53.000 --> 18:54.000\nbeing a hypothetical.\n\n18:54.000 --> 18:55.000\nI think it's going to be something\n\n18:55.000 --> 18:57.000\nthat you're going to run into a lot now.\n\n18:57.000 --> 18:58.000\nI want to plan for it\n\n18:58.000 --> 19:01.000\nand I'm going to need powerful friends, Jeff.\n\n19:01.000 --> 19:03.000\nPowerful, powerful friends.\n\n19:03.000 --> 19:06.000\nFrom the Marvel Universe,\n\n19:06.000 --> 19:09.000\nyou know her as the Red Sorceress.\n\n19:09.000 --> 19:11.000\nNow it's Scarlet Witch.\n\n19:11.000 --> 19:13.000\nIt's Elizabeth Olsen!\n\n19:13.000 --> 19:14.000\nHit it, babes!\n\n19:14.000 --> 19:33.000\nYeah.\n\n19:33.000 --> 19:35.000\nThe obvious joke to make is like,\n\n19:35.000 --> 19:39.000\nhey, could you use your signature Marvel power\n\n19:39.000 --> 19:41.000\nto undo that election?\n\n19:41.000 --> 19:43.000\nBut I've seen two movies now\n\n19:43.000 --> 19:45.000\nand I can't figure out what your signature power is.\n\n19:45.000 --> 19:48.000\nIt seems like you can do anything to anyone,\n\n19:48.000 --> 19:49.000\nbut it involves red light.\n\n19:49.000 --> 19:52.000\nYeah, that's as much as I understand.\n\n19:52.000 --> 19:56.000\nAnd I think at some point,\n\n19:56.000 --> 20:01.000\nI get to manipulate time, I think,\n\n20:01.000 --> 20:03.000\nat least in the comics.\n\n20:03.000 --> 20:05.000\nOh, good, because your character was kind of weak,\n\n20:05.000 --> 20:07.000\nso I was hoping they would give me...\n\n20:07.000 --> 20:09.000\nIs your mic on?\n\n20:09.000 --> 20:10.000\nAre you just far away from it?\n\n20:10.000 --> 20:12.000\nI don't do this much.\n\n20:12.000 --> 20:14.000\nThere you go.\n\n20:14.000 --> 20:16.000\nThank you.\n\n20:16.000 --> 20:21.000\nThat does make me curious.\n\n20:21.000 --> 20:23.000\nWhen you're in a movie like that\n\n20:23.000 --> 20:26.000\nwhere you're shooting gagoos and everything's like...\n\n20:26.000 --> 20:28.000\nSo then, let's say,\n\n20:28.000 --> 20:30.000\nJoss Whedon comes up,\n\n20:30.000 --> 20:32.000\nokay, we did one take,\n\n20:32.000 --> 20:34.000\nnow he's going to give you an adjustment.\n\n20:34.000 --> 20:36.000\nHow much...?\n\n20:36.000 --> 20:38.000\nHe actually made up the whole movement.\n\n20:38.000 --> 20:41.000\nIt was all in his head, so he had various...\n\n20:41.000 --> 20:46.000\nOh, yeah, he wrote it moving, like me.\n\n20:46.000 --> 20:48.000\nAt least he told me that,\n\n20:48.000 --> 20:51.000\nand he would physically ask me\n\n20:51.000 --> 20:53.000\nto do different physical things\n\n20:53.000 --> 20:55.000\nand demonstrate it for me,\n\n20:55.000 --> 20:56.000\nand the Russos don't do that.\n\n20:56.000 --> 20:59.000\nThey don't understand.\n\n20:59.000 --> 21:01.000\nThey're like, I don't know what to do with you.\n\n21:01.000 --> 21:02.000\nWhy don't you go away\n\n21:02.000 --> 21:04.000\nand figure it out with your choreographer?\n\n21:04.000 --> 21:06.000\nAnd I'm like, okay, great, I love what I do,\n\n21:06.000 --> 21:09.000\nbut we'll talk about it later.\n\n21:09.000 --> 21:12.000\nBut anyway, this is so frivolous.\n\n21:15.000 --> 21:17.000\nI wasn't going to go on to ask you,\n\n21:17.000 --> 21:19.000\nwhat's it like to wear so much makeup?\n\n21:19.000 --> 21:21.000\nI was going to eventually...\n\n21:21.000 --> 21:23.000\nI did invite you on,\n\n21:23.000 --> 21:25.000\nbecause we were doing a project together,\n\n21:25.000 --> 21:27.000\nand so you were one of the first people I saw\n\n21:27.000 --> 21:29.000\nin the wake of all of this.\n\n21:29.000 --> 21:31.000\nIn the wake of every woman in Los Angeles,\n\n21:31.000 --> 21:33.000\ngoing through something\n\n21:33.000 --> 21:35.000\nthat I'm not even allowed to pretend I understand,\n\n21:35.000 --> 21:37.000\nbecause that's just part of the problem,\n\n21:37.000 --> 21:39.000\nblah, blah, blah, and that makes me more mad,\n\n21:39.000 --> 21:41.000\nmakes me want to be manly and do things,\n\n21:41.000 --> 21:42.000\nand that's what the problem is,\n\n21:42.000 --> 21:43.000\nbecause we just elected a guy\n\n21:43.000 --> 21:45.000\nthat wants to be manly and do things,\n\n21:45.000 --> 21:48.000\nand it's like, I can't man-splain,\n\n21:48.000 --> 21:49.000\nbut the only thing to explain\n\n21:49.000 --> 21:51.000\nis that I want to man-splain,\n\n21:51.000 --> 21:53.000\nand not being able to man-splain\n\n21:53.000 --> 21:54.000\nis making me angry,\n\n21:54.000 --> 21:56.000\nand my therapist has verified\n\n21:56.000 --> 21:58.000\nthat that is every couple right now\n\n21:58.000 --> 21:59.000\nthat's coming through.\n\n21:59.000 --> 22:01.000\nIt's like, it's a woman with a...\n\n22:01.000 --> 22:02.000\nas a Star Wars fan,\n\n22:02.000 --> 22:06.000\nI would call it a carbon-scored feeling panel.\n\n22:06.000 --> 22:09.000\nThat was tricked over,\n\n22:09.000 --> 22:11.000\nlet's face it, 180 years\n\n22:11.000 --> 22:15.000\ninto putting a little fiber optic cable out,\n\n22:15.000 --> 22:18.000\nand then it just got sliced off\n\n22:18.000 --> 22:22.000\nwith this Cronenbergian penis slimy knife,\n\n22:22.000 --> 22:25.000\nlike, tricked you, got you,\n\n22:25.000 --> 22:27.000\nand now they're just wandering,\n\n22:27.000 --> 22:30.000\nbut anyways, what was I talking to you about?\n\n22:30.000 --> 22:33.000\nWe were talking about,\n\n22:33.000 --> 22:36.000\nI mean, I don't know if I represent\n\n22:36.000 --> 22:37.000\na feminine response.\n\n22:37.000 --> 22:38.000\nNo, not at all, no.\n\n22:38.000 --> 22:40.000\nBut, I mean, just because I don't...\n\n22:40.000 --> 22:41.000\nNo, you were like,\n\n22:41.000 --> 22:42.000\nI just pulled out my dick and vote,\n\n22:42.000 --> 22:43.000\nand I was like, whoa!\n\n22:43.000 --> 22:45.000\nIt's huge, but it blows red,\n\n22:45.000 --> 22:47.000\nand I can't, it was like...\n\n22:47.000 --> 22:48.000\nNo, no.\n\n22:48.000 --> 22:50.000\nI was actually not in the country,\n\n22:50.000 --> 22:52.000\nbecause I did a mail-in vote,\n\n22:52.000 --> 22:54.000\nand handed it in,\n\n22:54.000 --> 22:56.000\nbecause I was so scared to trust the mail service,\n\n22:56.000 --> 22:58.000\nand I was in Mexico City,\n\n22:58.000 --> 23:00.000\nand so that was really interesting,\n\n23:00.000 --> 23:02.000\nand I was talking...\n\n23:02.000 --> 23:04.000\nHow fast are they going to build this thing if it...\n\n23:04.000 --> 23:05.000\nWell, yeah.\n\n23:05.000 --> 23:07.000\nI mean, I guess the joke is,\n\n23:07.000 --> 23:08.000\nis now they're like,\n\n23:08.000 --> 23:10.000\nyeah, let's fucking build a wall,\n\n23:10.000 --> 23:12.000\nso no one from America can come in.\n\n23:12.000 --> 23:14.000\nThat's the only joke to make now,\n\n23:14.000 --> 23:16.000\nbut I had a friend when I was saying,\n\n23:16.000 --> 23:18.000\nreally emotionally on Wednesday morning,\n\n23:18.000 --> 23:19.000\nI was like,\n\n23:19.000 --> 23:21.000\nhow can there be so many races,\n\n23:21.000 --> 23:23.000\nand xenophobic people, and sexism,\n\n23:23.000 --> 23:25.000\nand everyone's so uneducated,\n\n23:25.000 --> 23:28.000\nour education system has failed us.\n\n23:28.000 --> 23:30.000\nHe just said,\n\n23:30.000 --> 23:32.000\nyou know, I don't...\n\n23:32.000 --> 23:34.000\nLike my president, I didn't vote for him,\n\n23:34.000 --> 23:36.000\nbut there are a lot of people in my country who did,\n\n23:36.000 --> 23:38.000\nand a lot of people make $2 an hour,\n\n23:38.000 --> 23:40.000\nand well, he first told me\n\n23:40.000 --> 23:42.000\nthat I was part of the problem for saying that,\n\n23:42.000 --> 23:44.000\nand then he said, you know,\n\n23:44.000 --> 23:46.000\nI don't blame the guy who makes $2 an hour\n\n23:46.000 --> 23:48.000\nfor voting for our president,\n\n23:48.000 --> 23:50.000\nbecause he actually bought his vote,\n\n23:50.000 --> 23:52.000\nand gave him a refrigerator,\n\n23:52.000 --> 23:54.000\nand I don't think he's stupid, I don't think he's ignorant,\n\n23:54.000 --> 23:56.000\nand I'm not saying we're in the same situation,\n\n23:56.000 --> 23:57.000\nbut I...\n\n23:57.000 --> 23:59.000\nWe don't measure things in refrigerators,\n\n23:59.000 --> 24:01.000\nbut they're coming along down there.\n\n24:01.000 --> 24:03.000\nI measure them in delicious Trump steaks.\n\n24:05.000 --> 24:07.000\nBut that is something to think about,\n\n24:07.000 --> 24:09.000\nlike, okay, how am I part of the problem\n\n24:09.000 --> 24:11.000\nby just naturally assuming that all these people\n\n24:11.000 --> 24:13.000\nare this, this, this, and this, and then...\n\n24:13.000 --> 24:15.000\nHow are you part of the solution, you mean?\n\n24:15.000 --> 24:17.000\nYeah, yeah, sorry, or...\n\n24:17.000 --> 24:19.000\nYou said, how am I part of the problem?\n\n24:19.000 --> 24:21.000\nYes, I am part of the problem,\n\n24:21.000 --> 24:23.000\nbecause I'm doing this.\n\n24:23.000 --> 24:25.000\nAnd because I have a vagina.\n\n24:25.000 --> 24:27.000\nIt's full of mystery,\n\n24:27.000 --> 24:29.000\nand betrayal.\n\n24:29.000 --> 24:31.000\nJust ask the blacks.\n\n24:31.000 --> 24:33.000\nThat's what I came here tonight to do,\n\n24:33.000 --> 24:35.000\nerase lines.\n\n24:35.000 --> 24:37.000\nYes, it...\n\n24:37.000 --> 24:39.000\nHow are you...\n\n24:39.000 --> 24:41.000\nThat's what I'm trying to figure out, is like,\n\n24:41.000 --> 24:43.000\nokay, so I... Yeah, it's like...\n\n24:43.000 --> 24:45.000\nAnd there's lines behind lines behind lines,\n\n24:45.000 --> 24:47.000\nbecause when I hear that story about Kumeil at the bar,\n\n24:47.000 --> 24:49.000\nI'm like, oh, bullies.\n\n24:49.000 --> 24:51.000\nI know what a bully is,\n\n24:51.000 --> 24:53.000\nand then that means I need to do this and this and that.\n\n24:53.000 --> 24:55.000\nI don't know those two guys.\n\n24:55.000 --> 24:57.000\nI know...\n\n24:57.000 --> 24:59.000\nI know five things about them,\n\n24:59.000 --> 25:01.000\nall of which total make them douchebags,\n\n25:01.000 --> 25:03.000\nand they needed to be dealt with\n\n25:03.000 --> 25:05.000\nin that moment, the way that they were dealt with,\n\n25:05.000 --> 25:07.000\nand we would be foolish\n\n25:07.000 --> 25:09.000\nto not ask ourselves at this point,\n\n25:11.000 --> 25:13.000\nshould we...\n\n25:13.000 --> 25:15.000\nThere's two things to think about for me.\n\n25:15.000 --> 25:17.000\nOne is, how do I deal with the anxiety,\n\n25:17.000 --> 25:19.000\nlike, in a healthy way?\n\n25:19.000 --> 25:21.000\nMm-hmm.\n\n25:21.000 --> 25:23.000\nWhich Emily Gordon, Kumeil's wife, like,\n\n25:23.000 --> 25:25.000\nthere's been a lot of great things online,\n\n25:25.000 --> 25:27.000\nand people going like,\n\n25:27.000 --> 25:29.000\nyou're filled with this shit right now.\n\n25:29.000 --> 25:31.000\nThe consensus seems to be,\n\n25:31.000 --> 25:33.000\nit's a great time to go volunteer\n\n25:33.000 --> 25:35.000\nfor stuff, which sounds like\n\n25:35.000 --> 25:37.000\na fucking last thing you want to do.\n\n25:37.000 --> 25:39.000\nBut it's like...\n\n25:39.000 --> 25:41.000\nI think it's the thing,\n\n25:41.000 --> 25:43.000\nif I force myself to go to 826LA\n\n25:43.000 --> 25:45.000\nand see what I can do to help,\n\n25:45.000 --> 25:47.000\nthat somehow that'll lead to some kind of relief\n\n25:47.000 --> 25:49.000\nin a healthy way.\n\n25:49.000 --> 25:51.000\nBut the other thing is that I can't ignore\n\n25:51.000 --> 25:53.000\nthe things like, aren't we supposed to get ready\n\n25:53.000 --> 25:55.000\nfor some fucking fisticuffs?\n\n25:55.000 --> 25:57.000\nI ordered a salad tonight\n\n25:57.000 --> 25:59.000\nat the restaurant, because I got to stop\n\n25:59.000 --> 26:01.000\neating Doritos, because there's Nazis.\n\n26:03.000 --> 26:05.000\nAnd I would be very\n\n26:05.000 --> 26:07.000\nfoolish to be like,\n\n26:07.000 --> 26:09.000\nmaybe they just need a hug.\n\n26:09.000 --> 26:11.000\nThat to me sounds like a great origin story\n\n26:11.000 --> 26:13.000\nfor an Avengers character.\n\n26:13.000 --> 26:15.000\nI actually\n\n26:15.000 --> 26:17.000\nI don't understand fighting violence\n\n26:17.000 --> 26:19.000\nwith violence, I just have never understood that.\n\n26:19.000 --> 26:21.000\nSo if some...\n\n26:21.000 --> 26:23.000\nI think kudos to say\n\n26:23.000 --> 26:25.000\nI'd stand straight up at that person\n\n26:25.000 --> 26:27.000\nand get him to back down.\n\n26:27.000 --> 26:29.000\nI think there is a version of that\n\n26:29.000 --> 26:31.000\nthat doesn't have to be\n\n26:31.000 --> 26:33.000\nviolent and confrontational.\n\n26:33.000 --> 26:35.000\nBut you and I have talked a lot\n\n26:35.000 --> 26:37.000\nabout the idea of\n\n26:37.000 --> 26:39.000\nlines and divides and trying to figure out\n\n26:41.000 --> 26:43.000\nNo one's...people are so scared\n\n26:43.000 --> 26:45.000\nto say how they felt.\n\n26:45.000 --> 26:47.000\nAnd it's because the people who have\n\n26:47.000 --> 26:49.000\nthe privilege to be\n\n26:49.000 --> 26:51.000\non social media and have a lot of\n\n26:51.000 --> 26:53.000\nfollowers, or to be\n\n26:53.000 --> 26:55.000\non a podcast, or to be on whatever.\n\n26:55.000 --> 26:57.000\nThey tend to all kind of believe the same\n\n26:57.000 --> 26:59.000\nthings. And we're all just talking\n\n26:59.000 --> 27:01.000\nto each other.\n\n27:01.000 --> 27:03.000\nAnd I think, you know, with algorithms\n\n27:03.000 --> 27:05.000\nand Facebook, and you just\n\n27:05.000 --> 27:07.000\nsee what you want to see.\n\n27:07.000 --> 27:09.000\nAnd I don't understand\n\n27:09.000 --> 27:11.000\nhow that's ever going to change anything.\n\n27:11.000 --> 27:13.000\nWe were all just talking to ourselves\n\n27:13.000 --> 27:15.000\nthe whole time. Like if you like\n\n27:15.000 --> 27:17.000\none side or the other, you're only listening\n\n27:17.000 --> 27:19.000\nto that one side.

already.\n\n01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:31.660\nSo we'd have to go through legal, but I'm sure Kesha would be down.\n\n01:02:33.660 --> 01:02:38.660\nTwo chains, a shirt, there were like 14 people in the

lines and peas and gears.\n\n01:03:10.660 --> 01:03:15.660\nI'm pretty sure we now owe Rick Rubin lots of royalties on what I just did.\n\n01:03:15.660 --> 01:03:19.660\nAnd everybody from that generation of hip hop and apology, I didn't mean you weren't talented.\n\n01:03:19.660 --> 01:03:21.660\nThat's ridiculous, I didn't mean that.\n\n01:03:21.660 --> 01:03:23.660\nI meant I'm not talented enough to rap fast.\n\n01:03:23.660 --> 01:03:26.660\nWe have the Sugar Hill gang coming on next week, so you can apologize.\n\n01:03:26.660 --> 01:03:29.660\nWe don't really like what you just said.\n\n01:03:31.660 --> 01:03:34.660\nWe're doing the best we can!\n\n01:03:34.660 --> 01:03:40.660\nNow don't push me, because I'm close to the air.\n\n01:03:44.660 --> 01:03:52.660\nThat's how slow hip hop moved is that the whole refrain was about them getting close to...\n\n01:03:52.660 --> 01:04:01.660\nYeah, but then the verses would be about Superman hands you your car keys and you get into your car.\n\n01:04:01.660 --> 01:04:06.660\nAnd you start the ignition and press the gas pedal and you start to go far.\n\n01:04:06.660 --> 01:04:11.660\nBut you haven't gone far yet, you still check your mirrors and you look at your blind spot.\n\n01:04:11.660 --> 01:04:16.660\nAnd you start to pull out but you've never been good at parallel parking.\n\n01:04:16.660 --> 01:04:23.660\nThere was a point in early hip hop where Debbie Harry from Blondie was one of the three best rappers in the world.\n\n01:04:23.660 --> 01:04:29.660\nI mean she was beautiful though, so of course she was allowed to rap.\n\n01:04:29.660 --> 01:04:38.660\nIt's really weird when you listen to that Blondie song and you're listening to her doing that.\n\n01:04:38.660 --> 01:04:47.660\nYou're like, oh that's like a YouTube kid taking a butter container and tapping it and turning it around while they do it.\n\n01:04:47.660 --> 01:04:54.660\nIt's like, oh it's an experimental style, like that's Blondie trying her hand at this thing from the streets.\n\n01:04:54.660 --> 01:04:59.660\nLike, no, my name's Blondie, I'm here to say, I don't know, it's kind of funny.\n\n01:04:59.660 --> 01:05:01.660\nBecause she's doing the same rap.\n\n01:05:01.660 --> 01:05:03.660\nBut she had Fab Five Freddie with her, right?\n\n01:05:03.660 --> 01:05:05.660\nI mean it worked, that song does fucking work.\n\n01:05:05.660 --> 01:05:11.660\nShe was in New York at the time and we don't know, Blondie probably could have been down.\n\n01:05:11.660 --> 01:05:12.660\nShe was Titus Fuck.\n\n01:05:12.660 --> 01:05:16.660\nOkay, we have Blondie's child is here tonight.\n\n01:05:16.660 --> 01:05:23.660\nHis rap name is Titus Fuck, so nice shout out to yourself Titus Fuck.\n\n01:05:23.660 --> 01:05:24.660\nTitus Fuck.\n\n01:05:24.660 --> 01:05:29.660\nI thought it was just complaining as her son that she was, yeah.\n\n01:05:29.660 --> 01:05:33.660\nYeah, 17 hour labor.\n\n01:05:33.660 --> 01:05:36.660\nIt's not on my end.\n\n01:05:36.660 --> 01:05:39.660\nShe's not ready to go.\n\n01:05:39.660 --> 01:05:48.660\nJesus Christ.\n\n01:05:48.660 --> 01:05:51.660\nSo, oh, me? Am I in charge?\n\n01:05:51.660 --> 01:05:56.660\nWell, have you noticed Skittles coming out in a lot of flavors?\n\n01:05:56.660 --> 01:06:00.660\nNo.\n\n01:06:00.660 --> 01:06:04.660\nI think that little piece of music, and I'm only half joking,\n\n01:06:04.660 --> 01:06:10.660\nobviously I'm making a joke, but that moment where we all laughed and clapped about doing that thing,\n\n01:06:10.660 --> 01:06:12.660\ndid we do it because we're sad?\n\n01:06:12.660 --> 01:06:13.660\nYes.\n\n01:06:13.660 --> 01:06:14.660\nAnd did it make us feel a lot better?\n\n01:06:14.660 --> 01:06:15.660\nAbsolutely.\n\n01:06:15.660 --> 01:06:20.660\nI think that little song we did softens my experience of the last week.\n\n01:06:20.660 --> 01:06:24.660\nWell, actually, that reminds me, let's talk about the thing that was the,\n\n01:06:24.660 --> 01:06:26.660\noh, at least music will be better.\n\n01:06:26.660 --> 01:06:29.660\nAt least, of course, we've all heard that about comedy.\n\n01:06:29.660 --> 01:06:32.660\nOh, remember John Stuart during the Bush administration and all that stuff?\n\n01:06:32.660 --> 01:06:33.660\nLet's talk about that for a second.\n\n01:06:33.660 --> 01:06:37.660\nLike, does that, I mean, like, are we just turning that on like a faucet?\n\n01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:39.660\nBecause for me, it feels deeper.\n\n01:06:39.660 --> 01:06:44.660\nLike, back then, I didn't, I knew that we were in a war with Iraq that I didn't believe in\n\n01:06:44.660 --> 01:06:46.660\nand that shit was being told to me.\n\n01:06:46.660 --> 01:06:51.660\nBut I was also like, not into Al Gore, I didn't think he was robbed and I didn't care.\n\n01:06:51.660 --> 01:06:54.660\nLike, I was like, I thought all that shit was for chumps.\n\n01:06:54.660 --> 01:06:56.660\nIs that just a part of being young?\n\n01:06:56.660 --> 01:06:59.660\nLike, like where you're like, fuck this whole system.\n\n01:06:59.660 --> 01:07:04.660\nYeah, you don't give a shit about shit until you own a house and you're like, I'm paying taxes on this.\n\n01:07:04.660 --> 01:07:07.660\nSo I want those motherfuckers not to park right there.\n\n01:07:07.660 --> 01:07:10.660\nSo I want to pass a law to get those motherfuckers not to park right there.\n\n01:07:10.660 --> 01:07:12.660\nAnd that's just part of getting older.\n\n01:07:12.660 --> 01:07:13.660\nI think that's a huge part of it.\n\n01:07:13.660 --> 01:07:14.660\nYou don't know.\n\n01:07:14.660 --> 01:07:15.660\nThat's a huge part of the middle class.\n\n01:07:15.660 --> 01:07:22.660\nI think if you go from lower middle class to middle class, like you become Republican with every fucking pebble in that path.\n\n01:07:22.660 --> 01:07:29.660\nI think in LA, we have a distorted vision of it because you can shoot up from lower middle class to the equivalent of\n\n01:07:29.660 --> 01:07:34.660\nupper class and the whole time retain your, you're like, I'll give my gardeners a bonus.\n\n01:07:34.660 --> 01:07:38.660\nBut there's a democratic version of don't park in front of my house.\n\n01:07:38.660 --> 01:07:42.660\nMaybe it's a cigarette tax or it's something else.\n\n01:07:42.660 --> 01:07:46.660\nEverybody, it's really, this is what we saw is like, we didn't know enough about each other.\n\n01:07:46.660 --> 01:07:47.660\nWe don't know enough about each other.\n\n01:07:47.660 --> 01:07:52.660\nSo if we had known more about each other, we might have respected rights of other people a little bit more.\n\n01:07:52.660 --> 01:07:56.660\nAnd I think that part of it is age because when you're a kid, of course, you don't know shit.\n\n01:07:56.660 --> 01:08:02.660\nBut we kind of have to look at ourselves and say, we should have checked in on those people once they started closing those factories.\n\n01:08:02.660 --> 01:08:08.660\nIt doesn't mean that we owe them anything, but we might have wanted to check on American a little bit more.\n\n01:08:08.660 --> 01:08:13.660\nThat's like, that's a fantastic way of weaving those cones because I want to really respect the people.\n\n01:08:13.660 --> 01:08:14.660\nI think Spencer's one of them.\n\n01:08:14.660 --> 01:08:20.660\nAnd I think I've been really, I've never expressed it to Spencer, but it's like, Spencer's a relatively young guy.\n\n01:08:20.660 --> 01:08:24.660\nAnd it's like, this is a big election and Spencer's like, I watch what he retweets and stuff.\n\n01:08:24.660 --> 01:08:26.660\nAnd I'm like, Spencer's on point.\n\n01:08:26.660 --> 01:08:28.660\nAnd he's like fucking mad.\n\n01:08:28.660 --> 01:08:30.660\nLike, like he's not, he's sick and tired.\n\n01:08:30.660 --> 01:08:32.660\nIs it correct me if I'm wrong?\n\n01:08:32.660 --> 01:08:41.660\nYou're sick and tired of the philosophy of like, oh God, see guys, like we shouldn't have ignored them.\n\n01:08:41.660 --> 01:08:45.660\nYou know, they have needs to don't forget to tolerate the intolerable.\n\n01:08:45.660 --> 01:08:49.660\nOr I'm sorry, don't forget to don't forget tolerance for the intolerant.\n\n01:08:49.660 --> 01:08:50.660\nYou're a little sick of that.\n\n01:08:50.660 --> 01:08:54.660\nLike, well, it's, I mean, we, we've had polls.\n\n01:08:54.660 --> 01:08:56.660\nWe did polls before this election.\n\n01:08:56.660 --> 01:09:03.660\nHalf of respondents in these polls, half of Trump supporters were like black people are more lazy and more violent than white people.\n\n01:09:03.660 --> 01:09:06.660\nA third of Clinton supporters thought that.\n\n01:09:06.660 --> 01:09:10.660\nSo it's just like, if you ask what their beliefs are, their beliefs are racist.\n\n01:09:10.660 --> 01:09:14.660\nAnd they believe in people who they think can help, but they're not going to help.\n\n01:09:14.660 --> 01:09:15.660\nThey're not going to help them.\n\n01:09:15.660 --> 01:09:18.660\nThey're only going to help them if they think that, you know, racism.\n\n01:09:18.660 --> 01:09:24.660\nDo you think that the blacks are the black thing about being lazy comes from the old slow rapping back from the 80s?\n\n01:09:24.660 --> 01:09:29.660\nIt certainly isn't how we met each other.\n\n01:09:29.660 --> 01:09:32.660\nI can't even be bothered to rap fast.\n\n01:09:36.660 --> 01:09:37.660\nSo high.\n\n01:09:40.660 --> 01:09:48.660\nI just, I think it's part, it's all, everyone's, you know, you kind of touch on it sometimes, but it's like the word intersectionality gets at that.\n\n01:09:48.660 --> 01:09:54.660\nThat there's this overarching oppressive system that tells white people that black people are taking their jobs and are causing them problems.\n\n01:09:54.660 --> 01:09:57.660\nIt tells men that women are, you know, not serious.\n\n01:09:57.660 --> 01:10:01.660\nIt tells the poor or rich people that poor people are to be feared.\n\n01:10:01.660 --> 01:10:09.660\nAnd it keeps us all complicit in kind of ignoring inequality that happens and ignoring that it's real and ignoring that it's dangerous.\n\n01:10:09.660 --> 01:10:13.660\nAnd that apathy is why half of the eligible voters stayed home.\n\n01:10:13.660 --> 01:10:16.660\nI mean, I think if they were more open to the real plight of people,\n\n01:10:16.660 --> 01:10:18.660\nthey would say, we can't elect Hitler.\n\n01:10:18.660 --> 01:10:19.660\nWe have to get out there.\n\n01:10:19.660 --> 01:10:22.660\nAnd I think we should have, you know, activated those people.\n\n01:10:22.660 --> 01:10:23.660\nBut we're still going to have to talk.\n\n01:10:23.660 --> 01:10:26.660\nYeah. No, we can't, because we can't just say, we can't just say, no, you're racist.\n\n01:10:26.660 --> 01:10:34.660\nWe have to say, you're not racist, but the way you act and the way you make decisions and policy choices is playing into the system that affects us all.\n\n01:10:34.660 --> 01:10:36.660\nAnd it affects you and it makes it so you can't get what you want.\n\n01:10:36.660 --> 01:10:38.660\nAnd it makes it so I can't get what I want.\n\n01:10:38.660 --> 01:10:39.660\nAnd it kills people.\n\n01:10:39.660 --> 01:10:44.660\nRight. So I think when you're in a drive through, this is unrelated.\n\n01:10:44.660 --> 01:10:46.660\nI'm just so hungry.\n\n01:10:46.660 --> 01:11:02.660\nI think when you're in a drive through, like you're the position that you've been placed in before you start communicating with the other person has a huge impact on every aspect that it's like, oh, the person on the other side of the drive through speaker,\n\n01:11:02.660 --> 01:11:05.660\nthey're speaking the same language as me.\n\n01:11:05.660 --> 01:11:07.660\nThey everything we're all in the same business.\n\n01:11:07.660 --> 01:11:08.660\nIt's McDonald's.\n\n01:11:08.660 --> 01:11:17.660\nWe all know one person wants a burger and how much it should cost and yet so much breakdown because of the position you've been placed in and the filter you're being placed in the other side of it.\n\n01:11:17.660 --> 01:11:19.660\nSo like, I don't know how to do this.\n\n01:11:19.660 --> 01:11:30.660\nI don't know what the practical aspect of this is, but I know that we're, I know that we can't wait for 300 million people to stop being fucking morons because the average IQ is 100.\n\n01:11:30.660 --> 01:11:41.660\nAnd if we don't start, if we don't start being comfortable with the idea that most of the people you meet, most of the people you love, most of the people that if you're in this city, you hope will one day worship you.\n\n01:11:41.660 --> 01:11:44.660\nLike, like, they're dumb.\n\n01:11:44.660 --> 01:11:47.660\nThey're dumb as a turd compared to.\n\n01:11:47.660 --> 01:11:50.660\nDan Harmon calls his fans dumb.\n\n01:11:50.660 --> 01:11:56.660\nLike, like, like, like, but, but we're all smarter than termites.\n\n01:11:56.660 --> 01:11:58.660\nGiraffes, baboons, rocks.\n\n01:11:58.660 --> 01:12:01.660\nIf you lay off giraffes for one episode, man.\n\n01:12:01.660 --> 01:12:04.660\nI'm not going to let them off the hook just because of this election.\n\n01:12:04.660 --> 01:12:07.660\nLike, they didn't come any closer to respect in my mind.\n\n01:12:07.660 --> 01:12:18.660\nWhen you find yourself talking to a person and you, you start to hear them like, bubble up, or you start to feel yourself bubbling up.\n\n01:12:18.660 --> 01:12:22.660\nLike, can you identify the speaker between you?\n\n01:12:22.660 --> 01:12:25.660\nCan you identify that you're at this drive through?\n\n01:12:25.660 --> 01:12:35.660\nCan you, because in real life, getting out of your car accelerated makes it a horrible TMZ clip of like, oh, this person wanted this McNuggets so bad.\n\n01:12:35.660 --> 01:12:37.660\nBut, but we're not true.\n\n01:12:37.660 --> 01:12:38.660\nThere's no McNuggets.\n\n01:12:38.660 --> 01:12:40.660\nStop beating that metaphor.\n\n01:12:40.660 --> 01:12:54.660\nWhen you are talking to a person over a wall and you feel like, like there is something between you that can't change instead of focusing on the wall or even trying to talk over it.\n\n01:12:54.660 --> 01:12:59.660\nIs there a position that both people can take relative to what you're trying to do?\n\n01:12:59.660 --> 01:13:05.660\nBecause what if both, what if those people talking over the wall are talking about something over there?\n\n01:13:05.660 --> 01:13:14.660\nLike a giant Anthony Hopkins created windmill machine that's going to create a canyon through the episode you're missing tonight.\n\n01:13:14.660 --> 01:13:19.660\nLike, what if you're both fucking robots?\n\n01:13:19.660 --> 01:13:26.660\nLike, you should both face the problem and you don't have to get over your differences.\n\n01:13:26.660 --> 01:13:31.660\nBecause that person, the differences might be that that person's fucking racist.\n\n01:13:31.660 --> 01:13:35.660\nAnd that when they look at you, they think that you're a worthless person.\n\n01:13:35.660 --> 01:13:43.660\nAnd that goes back again to like, I think the ladies learned this time around and Brandon's point is like, yeah, welcome to the fucking party.\n\n01:13:43.660 --> 01:13:50.660\nWhich is like, the music is amazing. You're going to love the music.\n\n01:13:50.660 --> 01:13:57.660\nA lot of people got a big fat taste of holy shit for real.\n\n01:13:57.660 --> 01:13:59.660\nNot in a Facebook policeable way.\n\n01:13:59.660 --> 01:14:03.660\nNot in a, are you being a little by my my way?\n\n01:14:03.660 --> 01:14:06.660\nNot in any kind of like, Kelly doesn't like you way.\n\n01:14:06.660 --> 01:14:08.660\nNot in a, I'm not hanging out with him way.\n\n01:14:08.660 --> 01:14:14.660\nNot in any way that's defeatable by any of that shit in a very real way.\n\n01:14:14.660 --> 01:14:20.660\nSomeone you might be talking to might be fucking just like looking at you and thinking, that's a vagina.\n\n01:14:20.660 --> 01:14:23.660\nThat's a black person. That's a white person.\n\n01:14:23.660 --> 01:14:26.660\nThat's a union person in my case.\n\n01:14:26.660 --> 01:14:27.660\nTalk to union people.\n\n01:14:27.660 --> 01:14:28.660\nYeah.\n\n01:14:28.660 --> 01:14:30.660\nThat is a space person.\n\n01:14:30.660 --> 01:14:32.660\nGod damn it, his props are electric.\n\n01:14:32.660 --> 01:14:35.660\nThey all have goatees.\n\n01:14:35.660 --> 01:14:44.660\nThe wall may be absolutely vile and may need to come down and maybe a huge part of a huge problem.\n\n01:14:44.660 --> 01:14:54.660\nBut like, how will you ever, like, yeah, that's the big question is like, can we somehow concretize the practice of, oh, there's a wall.\n\n01:14:54.660 --> 01:15:04.660\nOkay. Well, let's be better than two ants with a difference between each other and like do this ritual where we rotate 90 degrees.\n\n01:15:04.660 --> 01:15:06.660\nAnd we don't, we'll get back to that wall.\n\n01:15:06.660 --> 01:15:09.660\nThat wall is fucking even more visible this way.\n\n01:15:09.660 --> 01:15:10.660\nIt's right there.\n\n01:15:10.660 --> 01:15:12.660\nWe can even see how long it is and where it came from.\n\n01:15:12.660 --> 01:15:14.660\nI'm fucking nailing it now.\n\n01:15:14.660 --> 01:15:24.660\nWhat it connects to all the other walls and stuff, but like the most important thing being like, oh, are we controlling ourselves or are we letting these walls?\n\n01:15:24.660 --> 01:15:26.660\nBecause who put them there?\n\n01:15:26.660 --> 01:15:29.660\nBut yeah, that's what you have to, you have to reveal that stuff to people.\n\n01:15:29.660 --> 01:15:39.660\nAnd I think there's this gap, this disconnect because whenever I'm coming from a place, it's, it's from trying to help people and it's not always coming through.\n\n01:15:39.660 --> 01:15:50.660\nBut it's like, but my understanding that I don't say is that you're, you're focusing on issues of race is distracting you from the real problems that are affecting us all.\n\n01:15:50.660 --> 01:16:01.660\nAnd as long as people ignore that, ignore that disconnect, we're not going to be on the same page, but we have to say like, no, your problems are valid and they're real.\n\n01:16:01.660 --> 01:16:12.660\nAnd they're part of this thing that I acknowledge and it's valid and it's, and it's explainable by this system that also acknowledges that racism is a real thing that you should also acknowledge exists in the world.\n\n01:16:12.660 --> 01:16:14.660\nAnd I'm not saying you're racist.\n\n01:16:14.660 --> 01:16:16.660\nYou know, so like, I don't know.\n\n01:16:16.660 --> 01:16:20.660\nNo, you're on it, you're on it because that's what we've been doing wrong.\n\n01:16:20.660 --> 01:16:22.660\nWe've just been dismissing.\n\n01:16:22.660 --> 01:16:26.660\nAsperger Reddit guys, we're always saying to women and we're always going like, like, just shut up for a second.\n\n01:16:26.660 --> 01:16:29.660\nI'm trying to explain.\n\n01:16:29.660 --> 01:16:35.660\nIt's like, we're always like, like someone else, someone will tell, post a story about like, I was in a parking lot and all this stuff happened.\n\n01:16:35.660 --> 01:16:42.660\nAnd then like, Spencer and me come from a world where we're like helping when we go, yeah, but however, you probably shouldn't assume that person.\n\n01:16:42.660 --> 01:16:46.660\nAnd it's like, and it's like, you're, yeah.\n\n01:16:46.660 --> 01:16:47.660\nAnyways, what were you going to say?\n\n01:16:47.660 --> 01:16:54.660\nWell, I mean, I like, I just think that we're that no one's listening and I do think that there are deep seated issues in our country.\n\n01:16:54.660 --> 01:17:00.660\nAnd it's, I think it starts with our shitty education system and we go to, I spent a lot of time in Appalachia.\n\n01:17:00.660 --> 01:17:05.660\nAnd I don't know if anyone else has, but like, but like, a lot of towns are derelict.\n\n01:17:05.660 --> 01:17:10.660\nLike they don't have money to even tear down buildings that that they don't know what to do with.\n\n01:17:10.660 --> 01:17:13.660\nAnd then they let like mountains just grow there.\n\n01:17:13.660 --> 01:17:16.660\nThey don't even have funding for mountain clearing.\n\n01:17:16.660 --> 01:17:19.660\nBut like, you know, we all believe that global warming is happening.\n\n01:17:19.660 --> 01:17:21.660\nSo like, that's true.\n\n01:17:21.660 --> 01:17:24.660\nAnd green energy is good.\n\n01:17:24.660 --> 01:17:32.660\nYet they're huge industries that have relied on coal mining and just the in the mining business.\n\n01:17:32.660 --> 01:17:41.660\nAnd they now are losing jobs, coal mining, coal mining businesses have been like almost fully shut down.\n\n01:17:41.660 --> 01:17:47.660\nAnd not, I mean, not fully, but they're, everyone's losing jobs and then you lose jobs and then no one wants to be a teacher.\n\n01:17:47.660 --> 01:17:48.660\nNo one gets paid.\n\n01:17:48.660 --> 01:17:51.660\nNo one can create a business because no one's going to go out to a restaurant.\n\n01:17:51.660 --> 01:17:52.660\nNo one's going to give their money there.\n\n01:17:52.660 --> 01:17:54.660\nAnd then that, and then now they're all pissed.\n\n01:17:54.660 --> 01:17:56.660\nPeople have drug issues all over the country.\n\n01:17:56.660 --> 01:17:57.660\nNo one pays attention to it.\n\n01:17:57.660 --> 01:17:59.660\nStates have no tax revenue.\n\n01:17:59.660 --> 01:18:07.660\nAnd we're just, we're just, there's this cycle and people are mad and Trump made those people feel special also, as well as all the problems in the world.\n\n01:18:07.660 --> 01:18:10.660\nHe said, he said, he said, how's everybody doing tonight?\n\n01:18:10.660 --> 01:18:12.660\nOh, to section C.\n\n01:18:12.660 --> 01:18:16.660\nLike, like, like, like that was made a huge difference in the concert.\n\n01:18:16.660 --> 01:18:22.660\nAnd they, they came out and they voted and, and I don't know if he's going to fix their problems, but it's really fucking sad.\n\n01:18:22.660 --> 01:18:28.660\nAnd there is no alternative jobs for a lot of people who work in industries like that.\n\n01:18:28.660 --> 01:18:38.660\nAnd I just, I just think that we can, there's a way that we can go into areas and not have a political agenda and just understand.\n\n01:18:38.660 --> 01:18:44.660\nOkay, so you have a father, a grandfather who's been so angry for whatever reasons they didn't have an education.\n\n01:18:44.660 --> 01:18:46.660\nBut you know what, you're the new generation.\n\n01:18:46.660 --> 01:18:49.660\nLet's figure out how to serve you better.\n\n01:18:49.660 --> 01:18:52.660\nLet's figure out an education system that's, that's better for you.\n\n01:18:52.660 --> 01:18:57.660\nAnd then maybe we can even figure out a way for you to express yourself beyond school.\n\n01:18:57.660 --> 01:19:02.660\nYou can talk about all this weird shit happening in your head or what, you know, JJ said to you or whatever.\n\n01:19:02.660 --> 01:19:05.660\nLike, there's just, there's no, like, expression.\n\n01:19:05.660 --> 01:19:08.660\nYeah, make, make your kids less into multicam.\n\n01:19:08.660 --> 01:19:10.660\nYeah.\n\n01:19:10.660 --> 01:19:15.660\nFrom a TV perspective, it's just like, tell, tell them, tell them they have options.\n\n01:19:15.660 --> 01:19:19.660\nLike, there's like, like, it's just like, why would you want to hear other people laughing?\n\n01:19:19.660 --> 01:19:21.660\nIt's okay to just laugh at what you want to laugh at.\n\n01:19:21.660 --> 01:19:24.660\nRight. And it seems like if, if parents are voted.\n\n01:19:24.660 --> 01:19:30.660\nI'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to grind every ax I can while I still have a chance.\n\n01:19:30.660 --> 01:19:32.660\nPaul Bunyan's dying.\n\n01:19:32.660 --> 01:19:35.660\nNo, but it's coming down from the generations and their parents.\n\n01:19:35.660 --> 01:19:39.660\nAnd then, you know, if we want to change something, it starts with educating young people.\n\n01:19:39.660 --> 01:19:41.660\nAnd that's what Hillary Clinton was all about.\n\n01:19:41.660 --> 01:19:44.660\nAnd we have a shitty fucking system in our, in our country.\n\n01:19:44.660 --> 01:19:49.660\nAnd I'm super proud of the fact that in California and Los Angeles is like these concentric strongholds of like, you know,\n\n01:19:49.660 --> 01:19:55.660\nwe have like amazing, like if we choose to volunteer in LA overflowing, but when we were talking about this,\n\n01:19:55.660 --> 01:20:00.660\nand it's like, I don't know, I don't know if this is the most dumbest thing I've ever said or the smartest thing,\n\n01:20:00.660 --> 01:20:04.660\nbut it's like, oh, people say white privilege and then your skin bristles.\n\n01:20:04.660 --> 01:20:07.660\nBut it's like, oh, what if it was actually privileged?\n\n01:20:07.660 --> 01:20:14.660\nWhat if you could, for instance, what if you, I know you would be allowed to walk into a steel mill and nobody's going to be like,\n\n01:20:14.660 --> 01:20:16.660\nhey, who let Scarlet Witch in?\n\n01:20:16.660 --> 01:20:17.660\nI've gone to so many.\n\n01:20:17.660 --> 01:20:18.660\nSo many steel mills?\n\n01:20:18.660 --> 01:20:19.660\nSteel mills?\n\n01:20:19.660 --> 01:20:20.660\nCoal mines.\n\n01:20:20.660 --> 01:20:21.660\nName three.\n\n01:20:21.660 --> 01:20:23.660\nThey're all in West Virginia and I don't remember what they're called.\n\n01:20:23.660 --> 01:20:24.660\nThe Toulouseka load?\n\n01:20:24.660 --> 01:20:27.660\nThe, see, you see like bust out this deadwood jargon.\n\n01:20:27.660 --> 01:20:31.660\nNo, but that's, yeah, and that's, so what, well, what do you mean you bend to them?\n\n01:20:31.660 --> 01:20:36.660\nBecause my ex-boyfriend's family was from, or is from Kentucky.\n\n01:20:36.660 --> 01:20:37.660\nOh, you just bend to them?\n\n01:20:37.660 --> 01:20:39.660\nYou don't, you know, like, you're not like Princess Diana, like going to them.\n\n01:20:39.660 --> 01:20:40.660\nDo you mind, Cole?\n\n01:20:40.660 --> 01:20:46.660\nNo, I just, I literally just hung out and then he, he ended up making a film in, in West Virginia.\n\n01:20:46.660 --> 01:20:52.660\nAnd I was going to these places where, you know, at first everyone who's working in these,\n\n01:20:52.660 --> 01:20:56.660\nin these mines, they feel with you coming in camp with cameras.\n\n01:20:56.660 --> 01:20:59.660\nThey're already assuming that you're coming in to make them look stupid.\n\n01:20:59.660 --> 01:21:00.660\nTo make stock footage.\n\n01:21:00.660 --> 01:21:01.660\nTo make fun of them.\n\n01:21:01.660 --> 01:21:02.660\nYeah, they already think that.\n\n01:21:02.660 --> 01:21:03.660\nSo they're really defensive.\n\n01:21:03.660 --> 01:21:06.660\nThey just think, oh, you're going to make us look stupid in this movie.\n\n01:21:06.660 --> 01:21:10.660\nBecause I've been pitching every time one of these camera crews comes in, I pitch my fucking show.\n\n01:21:10.660 --> 01:21:12.660\nNo one listens.\n\n01:21:12.660 --> 01:21:13.660\nIt's a good idea.\n\n01:21:13.660 --> 01:21:17.660\nIt's about a guy who mines time.\n\n01:21:17.660 --> 01:21:19.660\nYou can't fucking tell me that's not a good idea.\n\n01:21:19.660 --> 01:21:21.660\nBut no, I got soot all over my face.\n\n01:21:21.660 --> 01:21:23.660\nSo everyone's like, look at the jackass.\n\n01:21:23.660 --> 01:21:25.660\nWhat was, what's the show called?\n\n01:21:25.660 --> 01:21:29.660\nTime Miner, you fucking faggot.\n\n01:21:29.660 --> 01:21:33.660\nFucking big city faggot.\n\n01:21:33.660 --> 01:21:34.660\nCan I get back to work?\n\n01:21:34.660 --> 01:21:35.660\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:21:35.660 --> 01:21:36.660\nAre you going to buy my show?\n\n01:21:36.660 --> 01:21:37.660\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:21:37.660 --> 01:21:38.660\nLet me get back to fucking work.\n\n01:21:38.660 --> 01:21:48.660\nBecause you were handicapped, I'm sorry.\n\n01:21:48.660 --> 01:21:51.660\nI went to, I've been to Morgantown, West Virginia.\n\n01:21:51.660 --> 01:21:53.660\nThat's where the college is, though, right?\n\n01:21:53.660 --> 01:21:54.660\nThat's where the...\n\n01:21:54.660 --> 01:21:55.660\nYeah, I haven't been there.\n\n01:21:55.660 --> 01:21:57.660\nThat's where the mountaineers are.\n\n01:21:57.660 --> 01:21:58.660\nI do comedy shows.\n\n01:21:58.660 --> 01:22:05.660\nWe'll go to rural areas, but we're usually around where the colleges are, which tend to lean a little bit more liberal.\n\n01:22:05.660 --> 01:22:11.660\nBut when you get slightly out of town, you're in straight up red state, like real stuff.\n\n01:22:11.660 --> 01:22:15.660\nAnd some of the coolest, nicest, funniest, happiest people you'll ever meet in the world.\n\n01:22:15.660 --> 01:22:29.660\nYeah, a lot of people that I, you know, I tried to, you know, exercise this thing of I have these, in my mind, educated beliefs and trying to be patient and listen.\n\n01:22:29.660 --> 01:22:34.660\nAnd all you can hear on the other end is, they are shit out of luck right now.\n\n01:22:34.660 --> 01:22:36.660\nLike, they don't have a lot to hold on to.\n\n01:22:36.660 --> 01:22:38.660\nAnd that's all you can think about.\n\n01:22:38.660 --> 01:22:44.660\nAnd you can't, and you don't, you can't then label it as, as stupid or ignorant.\n\n01:22:44.660 --> 01:22:45.660\nIt's just...\n\n01:22:45.660 --> 01:22:49.660\nYou also can't be like, oh, let's flood all of our passion into this ailing part of the country.\n\n01:22:49.660 --> 01:22:54.660\nBecause every black woman that's not listening to this podcast, because I have zero black women listeners.\n\n01:22:54.660 --> 01:22:55.660\nBecause I've already...\n\n01:22:55.660 --> 01:22:56.660\nThat's not true.\n\n01:22:56.660 --> 01:22:58.660\nOh, Brandon.\n\n01:22:58.660 --> 01:23:02.660\nLet's show that footage of 13 black women watching dance harm.\n\n01:23:02.660 --> 01:23:03.660\nOh.\n\n01:23:03.660 --> 01:23:06.660\nI thought, I thought you just came out as trans.\n\n01:23:06.660 --> 01:23:19.660\nI just like, we have to like, we have to be like, okay, it was a terrible strategy for the Democrats to ignore what would be really uncharismatic, rightfully so, uncharismatic.\n\n01:23:19.660 --> 01:23:38.660\nIt would be a hard thing to be trying to get the Democratic vote and to be honest and practical if you were really also simultaneously, in addition to trying to get the Democratic vote, also trying to be honest and declare an agenda for change.\n\n01:23:38.660 --> 01:23:49.660\nYou're just shooting yourself in the foot, standing up behind any podium during that campaign and going, and let's not forget the beleaguered honky.\n\n01:23:49.660 --> 01:23:57.660\nOh, languishing from his Bruce Springsteen factory, somewhere out there, wishing for more whiteness.\n\n01:23:57.660 --> 01:23:59.660\nWill he ever get what he deserves?\n\n01:23:59.660 --> 01:24:01.660\nLike, that is a Republican.\n\n01:24:01.660 --> 01:24:03.660\nThat came to be a conservative thing.\n\n01:24:03.660 --> 01:24:10.660\nI was like, oh, because those guys are fiscal conservatives, which means they'll never win democratically.\n\n01:24:10.660 --> 01:24:19.660\nThey have to attach that caboose to a train with an engine, which is a lot of people who are scared of gay people, scared of culture, scared of...\n\n01:24:19.660 --> 01:24:32.660\nAnd it's like, those lines get drawn, then you have Democrats going, oh, so everyone that's working with a welding torch in their hand is a moron who hates gay people,\n\n01:24:32.660 --> 01:24:39.660\nwho's going to vote for George Bush, or is living in a district that's going to go red anyway, so fuck them.\n\n01:24:39.660 --> 01:24:48.660\nAnd also, I'd lose 10 black votes, even bothering to throw one of those Joe the Plumber fucking aside during any visit to anything, because fuck that guy.\n\n01:24:48.660 --> 01:24:58.660\nSo what if, yeah, and it's like, this is why these lines, they have sucked us into a world wrestling franchise.\n\n01:24:58.660 --> 01:25:02.660\nThey have told us there are good guys and there are bad guys.\n\n01:25:02.660 --> 01:25:06.660\nIt doesn't really matter who. It's linked to all kinds of visceral stuff.\n\n01:25:06.660 --> 01:25:09.660\nThere's an iron chic, and that's got all kinds of symbolic value.\n\n01:25:09.660 --> 01:25:19.660\nBut we all know, we all celebrate on CNN and Fox News and in our living rooms, we all know that they don't actually represent those things.\n\n01:25:19.660 --> 01:25:22.660\nWe all know that Donald Trump, for instance, does not work as a janitor.\n\n01:25:22.660 --> 01:25:26.660\nHe does not weld anything. He's never successfully owned a business.\n\n01:25:26.660 --> 01:25:32.660\nI don't mean to get fucking controversial, and he's rapey.\n\n01:25:32.660 --> 01:25:37.660\nBut we all know that he doesn't represent American value.\n\n01:25:37.660 --> 01:25:44.660\nWe all know that politicians put on the show. They're professional wrestlers. They're symbols.\n\n01:25:44.660 --> 01:25:53.660\nWe go like, oh, well, I don't expect Bill Clinton to say, I believe women are the future, and then go off and fondle them.\n\n01:25:53.660 --> 01:25:57.660\nHe's a politician. He has to wear that blazer. That comes with fondling women.\n\n01:25:57.660 --> 01:26:02.660\nWe make allowances for these performers because we accept that they're engaged in chicanery.\n\n01:26:02.660 --> 01:26:07.660\nWe accept that we're idiots. We sit there and we cheer for symbols.\n\n01:26:07.660 --> 01:26:12.660\nWe punish them for becoming real. We find photos of them smoking joints in college,\n\n01:26:12.660 --> 01:26:18.660\nand if that's not culturally right at that time, then we go, caught you, you weren't Hulk Hogan, your name was Terry.\n\n01:26:18.660 --> 01:26:25.660\nYou can't be a wrestler anymore. You didn't come out of your mother's womb and grab a lion.\n\n01:26:25.660 --> 01:26:30.660\nWe know it's fake, and then we insist, and then we wonder why.\n\n01:26:30.660 --> 01:26:37.660\nSo we sit in this franchise, but then the mindblower is, when people who go to professional wrestling\n\n01:26:37.660 --> 01:26:46.660\nand who get to fucking get some of their feelings out by yelling at red guy versus blue guy in a ring,\n\n01:26:46.660 --> 01:26:53.660\nthey get to leave that venue, get in their cars, go home, and decide how to watch television,\n\n01:26:53.660 --> 01:26:58.660\nhow to order popcorn. Do you order popcorn? Again, out of touch.\n\n01:26:58.660 --> 01:27:05.660\nHow to interact with, how to leave a comment under your favorite or least favorite thing.\n\n01:27:05.660 --> 01:27:11.660\nThe reality that we're living in when you, the metaphor I'm talking about is they won't,\n\n01:27:11.660 --> 01:27:16.660\nthey're never going to let us out. We have to leave the venue.\n\n01:27:16.660 --> 01:27:22.660\nAnd it's not a physical venue, but they have it built around all of our lives.\n\n01:27:22.660 --> 01:27:31.660\nWe sleep and dream in it. Some people here tonight, I guarantee you, because that election was so volatile.\n\n01:27:31.660 --> 01:27:38.660\nSo it was such an event. There are people here tonight who are here with boyfriends or girlfriends\n\n01:27:38.660 --> 01:27:43.660\nthat are now their boyfriends or girlfriends because they broke up with someone on Tuesday.\n\n01:27:43.660 --> 01:27:51.660\nI bet 20% of people here tonight have gotten in fights and ended relationships.\n\n01:27:51.660 --> 01:27:55.660\nThe people in the wrestling ring go into the back room and they do cocaine.\n\n01:27:55.660 --> 01:27:59.660\nAnd they're nuts shrivel up and they write books and they don't sell and they're sad.\n\n01:27:59.660 --> 01:28:04.660\nAnd then Mickey Rourke plays them in a movie and he even doesn't get an Oscar.\n\n01:28:04.660 --> 01:28:09.660\nThey don't even be mad at them. They're just clowns.\n\n01:28:09.660 --> 01:28:15.660\nWe just need to like, that's all I'm waking up to is like, holy shit man.\n\n01:28:15.660 --> 01:28:21.660\nHow do we get out of there? And you get out of there like the moment you go like, oh, it's not real.\n\n01:28:21.660 --> 01:28:27.660\nIt's not real. And I'm not saying don't vote. Vote for this crazy person right in your friend.\n\n01:28:27.660 --> 01:28:30.660\nTurn the poll over. I don't know man.\n\n01:28:30.660 --> 01:28:34.660\nI just like, like we got nothing but time now to go.\n\n01:28:34.660 --> 01:28:40.660\nOkay, so that happened. That's like an ice pick that goes down the middle of this block and it's like fragmented.\n\n01:28:40.660 --> 01:28:43.660\nAnd now it's all laid bare and there's chunks and all this shit.\n\n01:28:43.660 --> 01:28:48.660\nBe very careful as we pick up each chunk or as we clean up all this stuff.\n\n01:28:48.660 --> 01:28:51.660\nAre we going to do so under the religion that got us here?\n\n01:28:51.660 --> 01:28:58.660\nWhich is the religion of division, the religion of these demographics that we found out can't even predict polls.\n\n01:28:58.660 --> 01:29:04.660\nIf they were going to have any function, like they certainly never applied to who's going to give you a cup of sugar.\n\n01:29:04.660 --> 01:29:07.660\nLike we knew that. That was what all our stories were about.\n\n01:29:07.660 --> 01:29:11.660\nOh, I thought that black guy was going to stab me according to CNN.\n\n01:29:11.660 --> 01:29:14.660\nBut then he helped me change my tire.\n\n01:29:14.660 --> 01:29:17.660\nOr took my heart out of my chest.\n\n01:29:17.660 --> 01:29:22.660\nOh, god damn it.\n\n01:29:22.660 --> 01:29:26.660\nThe black people are stealing hearts now?\n\n01:29:26.660 --> 01:29:31.660\nOr the horrible story where I thought that black guy was going to help me change my tire.\n\n01:29:31.660 --> 01:29:34.660\nBut he took my heart out of my chest.\n\n01:29:34.660 --> 01:29:39.660\nI just don't want to hear a story where I got a job out of this shit.\n\n01:29:39.660 --> 01:29:44.660\nI got sidetracked there because I got excited about a new thought about tachotomy.\n\n01:29:44.660 --> 01:29:50.660\nBut what have I learned since I saw you guys?\n\n01:29:50.660 --> 01:29:53.660\nNothing I ever think politically is going to happen.\n\n01:29:53.660 --> 01:29:57.660\nNone of my predictions ever come true.\n\n01:29:57.660 --> 01:30:05.660\nWe can't keep expressing ourselves about injustice that we're reading about on Facebook and the Walmarts.\n\n01:30:05.660 --> 01:30:10.660\nAnd the guys snatching those headscarves off and saying, you should hang yourself with us.\n\n01:30:10.660 --> 01:30:15.660\nIt won't stop if we just, we should retweet it.\n\n01:30:15.660 --> 01:30:19.660\nThe retweet won't stop it.\n\n01:30:19.660 --> 01:30:22.660\nIt's part of the show you're talking about.\n\n01:30:22.660 --> 01:30:25.660\nIt's fun. Andy Kaufman knew that.\n\n01:30:25.660 --> 01:30:29.660\nA boo is worth two laughs.\n\n01:30:29.660 --> 01:30:31.660\nBut that doesn't mean don't talk about it.\n\n01:30:31.660 --> 01:30:34.660\nDon't go numb. I'm not telling you what to do.\n\n01:30:34.660 --> 01:30:36.660\nI'm telling you what I'm telling myself to do.\n\n01:30:36.660 --> 01:30:39.660\nDon't go numb. Stop being surprised.\n\n01:30:39.660 --> 01:30:45.660\nFigure out what the fuck to do.\n\n01:30:45.660 --> 01:30:47.660\nCommunicate with each other.\n\n01:30:47.660 --> 01:30:58.660\nBe honest about, like, if you perceive any division between you and another person that has nothing to do with what you know about them as an individual,\n\n01:30:58.660 --> 01:31:02.660\ntry just brave the lack of charisma that is.\n\n01:31:02.660 --> 01:31:09.660\nWell, I think, is it possible that the way we're talking to each other right now has something to do with the fact that you're a barista and I'm a customer?\n\n01:31:09.660 --> 01:31:12.660\nBecause I don't fucking like, I didn't buy a ticket to that.\n\n01:31:12.660 --> 01:31:14.660\nI just want my coffee, bitch.\n\n01:31:14.660 --> 01:31:15.660\nNo, sorry. Bad example.\n\n01:31:15.660 --> 01:31:20.660\nWell, that came off the rails pretty fast.\n\n01:31:20.660 --> 01:31:25.660\nYeah, that wasn't, Dan, give us leadership. Tell us what to think. I'm failing.\n\n01:31:25.660 --> 01:31:33.660\nWell, I'll butt in to say that this election was so bad that it killed Leonard Cohen.\n\n01:31:33.660 --> 01:31:34.660\nYes.\n\n01:31:34.660 --> 01:31:38.660\nBut happily, Prince and Bowie weren't around to see this shit, which is great.\n\n01:31:38.660 --> 01:31:40.660\nThey got out where the gutting was good. I love that.\n\n01:31:40.660 --> 01:31:48.660\nThere's a funny tweet I saw that somebody said, like, Leonard Cohen's in heaven with Prince and Bowie now jamming out.\n\n01:31:48.660 --> 01:31:56.660\nBut it's awful because their styles are so incompatible.\n\n01:31:56.660 --> 01:32:00.660\nWell, Leonard Cohen said there's a crack in everything. That's how the light gets in.\n\n01:32:00.660 --> 01:32:05.660\nSo maybe this is a crack in that.\n\n01:32:05.660 --> 01:32:06.660\nIt goes like this.\n\n01:32:06.660 --> 01:32:12.660\nThat quote was tight as fuck.\n\n01:32:12.660 --> 01:32:17.660\nI guess the fourth, the fifth, the minor fall.\n\n01:32:17.660 --> 01:32:19.660\nThe major lift.\n\n01:32:19.660 --> 01:32:21.660\nThe baffled king composing.\n\n01:32:21.660 --> 01:32:24.660\nWell, that part's just like, what is that?\n\n01:32:24.660 --> 01:32:25.660\nIt's the hook.\n\n01:32:25.660 --> 01:32:29.660\nWe've been moving.\n\n01:32:29.660 --> 01:32:31.660\nIt's also the title of the song.\n\n01:32:31.660 --> 01:32:32.660\nI know.\n\n01:32:32.660 --> 01:32:35.660\nWe've been moving up.\n\n01:32:35.660 --> 01:32:36.660\nTo the east side.\n\n01:32:36.660 --> 01:32:42.660\nTo a deluxe apartment in the sky.\n\n01:32:42.660 --> 01:32:44.660\nWhen you get on Twitter.\n\n01:32:44.660 --> 01:32:48.660\nI thought you could start doing a weird Gregorian chant there.\n\n01:32:48.660 --> 01:32:53.660\nAnd someone tries to troll you by saying you're a piece of fucking shit.\n\n01:32:53.660 --> 01:32:54.660\nFuck you.\n\n01:32:54.660 --> 01:32:56.660\nYou shouldn't say that.\n\n01:32:56.660 --> 01:33:00.660\nTell them fuck you.\n\n01:33:00.660 --> 01:33:03.660\nBecause I don't think that they came there to connect with you.\n\n01:33:03.660 --> 01:33:07.660\nI think they came there to do that.\n\n01:33:07.660 --> 01:33:09.660\nAnd they should just get that back.\n\n01:33:09.660 --> 01:33:14.660\nAnd you shouldn't also put a corkscrew in the pillow case and be like,\n\n01:33:14.660 --> 01:33:18.660\nsurprise motherfucker.\n\n01:33:18.660 --> 01:33:22.660\nYou should just be like, fuck you poop face.\n\n01:33:22.660 --> 01:33:25.660\nJust say fuck you poop face.\n\n01:33:25.660 --> 01:33:26.660\nDon't be afraid.\n\n01:33:26.660 --> 01:33:31.660\nDon't make it your mission to prove that they can't hurt you.\n\n01:33:31.660 --> 01:33:34.660\nOur enemy is going to be dishonesty moving forward.\n\n01:33:34.660 --> 01:33:36.660\nThat's what those guys who poked Camille in the chest.\n\n01:33:36.660 --> 01:33:38.660\nHow dishonest can you get?\n\n01:33:38.660 --> 01:33:42.660\nWhen you need booze and a presence.\n\n01:33:42.660 --> 01:33:46.660\nTo walk up to somebody and say, I don't like your politics.\n\n01:33:46.660 --> 01:33:48.660\nEverything those guys said was a lie.\n\n01:33:48.660 --> 01:33:50.660\nThey came up and said they're big fans.\n\n01:33:50.660 --> 01:33:52.660\nAnd then wanted to harass them.\n\n01:33:52.660 --> 01:33:53.660\nThey breathe lies.\n\n01:33:53.660 --> 01:33:55.660\nEverything they do is a lie.\n\n01:33:55.660 --> 01:33:57.660\nThey're in their own hell.\n\n01:33:57.660 --> 01:34:00.660\nWe're going to be fighting dishonesty.\n\n01:34:00.660 --> 01:34:05.660\nFrankly, don't trust your friend just because they're spouting some shit\n\n01:34:05.660 --> 01:34:07.660\nthat suggests that they're liberal.\n\n01:34:07.660 --> 01:34:10.660\nActually have a conversation with them.\n\n01:34:10.660 --> 01:34:12.660\nThat's what friendship's about.\n\n01:34:12.660 --> 01:34:13.660\nJust ask them.\n\n01:34:13.660 --> 01:34:17.660\nJust find a Russian to go through your friend's emails and find out exactly.\n\n01:34:17.660 --> 01:34:20.660\nAnd confess your own shit and say like, hey, we're best friends.\n\n01:34:20.660 --> 01:34:24.660\nWe've been pretty much resigned to the idea that we're liberal\n\n01:34:24.660 --> 01:34:27.660\nand we hate racism and xenophobia is bad.\n\n01:34:27.660 --> 01:34:34.660\nBut you use the N word a lot when you're freestyling alone in your kitchen, right?\n\n01:34:34.660 --> 01:34:37.660\nYes, yes, I do.\n\n01:34:37.660 --> 01:34:41.660\nDo you want my permission?\n\n01:34:41.660 --> 01:34:42.660\nI can give you my permission.\n\n01:34:42.660 --> 01:34:44.660\nHave that conversation with you.\n\n01:34:44.660 --> 01:34:45.660\nOh, really?\n\n01:34:45.660 --> 01:34:48.660\nYou can give out the permission?\n\n01:34:48.660 --> 01:34:52.660\nNo, I said get that permission from yourself or your friend.\n\n01:34:52.660 --> 01:34:54.660\nYou're a black friend, though.\n\n01:34:54.660 --> 01:34:55.660\nYou should get a friend.\n\n01:34:55.660 --> 01:35:00.660\nNo, your regime is over.\n\n01:35:00.660 --> 01:35:02.660\nI just told you.\n\n01:35:02.660 --> 01:35:05.660\nDon't you understand when I talk to you?\n\n01:35:05.660 --> 01:35:06.660\nSorry.\n\n01:35:06.660 --> 01:35:10.660\nBrandon, Brandon, you're not content with eight years of black people ruling the world.\n\n01:35:10.660 --> 01:35:14.660\nYeah, how much more of this shit do we have to put up with?\n\n01:35:14.660 --> 01:35:17.660\nWe tried to help you.\n\n01:35:17.660 --> 01:35:19.660\nOh, with the health care, the health care.\n\n01:35:19.660 --> 01:35:23.660\nAs soon as these guys get in the White House, they're going to repeal.\n\n01:35:23.660 --> 01:35:26.660\nYeah, whoops.\n\n01:35:26.660 --> 01:35:31.660\nLizzie, I'm guessing you're a Hillary supporter, right?\n\n01:35:31.660 --> 01:35:33.660\nWere you hardcore?\n\n01:35:33.660 --> 01:35:35.660\nWere you like gung-mo?\n\n01:35:35.660 --> 01:35:40.660\nYeah, I mean hardcore with my community of friends and family.\n\n01:35:40.660 --> 01:35:46.660\nWhat do you think the future for the next time a woman runs for president is?\n\n01:35:46.660 --> 01:35:53.660\nI may be wrong when I say that I think our country is more sexist and racist in lots of ways.\n\n01:35:53.660 --> 01:35:56.660\nWe let freed black men vote before women.\n\n01:35:56.660 --> 01:35:58.660\nGod damn it.\n\n01:35:58.660 --> 01:36:02.660\nThere's both.\n\n01:36:02.660 --> 01:36:07.660\nMisogyny is a huge thing here.\n\n01:36:07.660 --> 01:36:09.660\nI don't know.\n\n01:36:09.660 --> 01:36:14.660\nIt's not my place to say it, but I feel that there was a huge anti-women thing going on in this whole thing.\n\n01:36:14.660 --> 01:36:18.660\nWe certainly will go kicking and screaming into letting a woman run our country.\n\n01:36:18.660 --> 01:36:23.660\nIt was definitely weird that the entire election came down to three perverts.\n\n01:36:23.660 --> 01:36:33.660\nIt was just a conversation about Trump grabbing pussy, Bill having this affair, and then Anthony Wiener showed up.\n\n01:36:33.660 --> 01:36:43.660\nAnd it was just all about three men in power who was the worst or evil of sexually offending women.\n\n01:36:43.660 --> 01:36:45.660\nI just thought that was so weird.\n\n01:36:45.660 --> 01:36:49.660\nAnd that was two weeks before we voted.\n\n01:36:49.660 --> 01:36:51.660\nIt was just strange.\n\n01:36:51.660 --> 01:36:54.660\nI grew up in LA. I'm from LA.\n\n01:36:54.660 --> 01:36:58.660\nI feel very lucky with what I've been able to do.\n\n01:36:58.660 --> 01:37:02.660\nI don't feel it as me.\n\n01:37:02.660 --> 01:37:05.660\nI can't speak for other people.\n\n01:37:05.660 --> 01:37:08.660\nI don't feel that.\n\n01:37:08.660 --> 01:37:12.660\nI see racism more than I see sexism in my life.\n\n01:37:12.660 --> 01:37:15.660\nI don't know what that means.\n\n01:37:15.660 --> 01:37:20.660\nBut I mean, with me, that's just my personal experience.\n\n01:37:20.660 --> 01:37:24.660\nI'm sure every single person here has a thousand personal experiences.\n\n01:37:24.660 --> 01:37:36.660\nIt's hard because when those results came in, I was like, oh, because we sleep with them.\n\n01:37:36.660 --> 01:37:39.660\nWait, but don't they sleep with you too?\n\n01:37:39.660 --> 01:37:42.660\nWell, that's the thing.\n\n01:37:42.660 --> 01:37:45.660\nI mean, you're allowed to go, yeah, but I don't know.\n\n01:37:45.660 --> 01:37:47.660\nIt wasn't like, oh, I didn't know that.\n\n01:37:47.660 --> 01:37:49.660\nThey were also sleeping with me.\n\n01:37:49.660 --> 01:37:54.660\nI'm talking about this irony that we always point to where we're like, man, yes.\n\n01:37:54.660 --> 01:38:02.660\nWe're so misogynist that we, in the list of amendments, when you look at the history of our Constitution,\n\n01:38:02.660 --> 01:38:07.660\nthe virus that is our country that we hope infects the planet and the universe,\n\n01:38:07.660 --> 01:38:12.660\nbecause it's that or Putin, am I right?\n\n01:38:12.660 --> 01:38:14.660\nIt's sequence of DNA.\n\n01:38:14.660 --> 01:38:17.660\nWhen you backtrack through it, because there's a paper trail,\n\n01:38:17.660 --> 01:38:28.660\nwe got woke about the idea that some people aren't animals before we decided women should participate in the election.\n\n01:38:28.660 --> 01:38:31.660\nAnd we were married to them before that.\n\n01:38:31.660 --> 01:38:38.660\nSo that is the crazy thing to me, which also is an uplifting thing, because it further suggests,\n\n01:38:38.660 --> 01:38:46.660\nyeah, these lines, they're so much deeper than you would ever, that you can't see the right ones when you focus on the ones you can see.\n\n01:38:46.660 --> 01:38:51.660\nAnd people will use the ones you can see as a distraction from the ones you can't.\n\n01:38:51.660 --> 01:39:02.660\nAnd it's like, we are eight billion strong, like we have come to this point where we are elbow to elbow competing for oxygen with each other,\n\n01:39:02.660 --> 01:39:04.660\nwhich is supposed to be a crisis.\n\n01:39:04.660 --> 01:39:10.660\nSo some of us are all thinking about, I think, instinctively like rats, how do I get rid of the wrong ones?\n\n01:39:10.660 --> 01:39:11.660\nHow do I get some space?\n\n01:39:11.660 --> 01:39:13.660\nHow do I get the brown ones back out of here?\n\n01:39:13.660 --> 01:39:17.660\nMaybe that gimmick worked when we were trying to build things, but they got to go.\n\n01:39:17.660 --> 01:39:18.660\nLike, I need some space.\n\n01:39:18.660 --> 01:39:22.660\nI think we're just reacting like insects or rats to the idea.\n\n01:39:22.660 --> 01:39:29.660\nIt's not even like we experience it regularly, where we're like, I can't get into this Starbucks overpopulation.\n\n01:39:29.660 --> 01:39:31.660\nIt's like, that's lunch hour.\n\n01:39:31.660 --> 01:39:36.660\nIt's like Starbucks needs to get its shit together.\n\n01:39:36.660 --> 01:39:43.660\nI think that eight billion people going like this and being like, hi, how are you?\n\n01:39:43.660 --> 01:39:44.660\nHi, Dan Harmon, nice to meet you.\n\n01:39:44.660 --> 01:39:46.660\nI remember you from the Marvel movie.\n\n01:39:46.660 --> 01:39:48.660\nOh, hey, how are you, Brady? Good to see you again.\n\n01:39:48.660 --> 01:39:50.660\nThat we're all rubbing up against each other.\n\n01:39:50.660 --> 01:39:56.660\nThat is an invitation to like go granular.\n\n01:39:56.660 --> 01:40:01.660\nWe keep looking at it as like, man, now more than ever, we really need to categorize ourselves.\n\n01:40:01.660 --> 01:40:03.660\nThere's so many people and we're so squished together.\n\n01:40:03.660 --> 01:40:05.660\nWe got to figure out, okay.\n\n01:40:05.660 --> 01:40:08.660\nAnd now it's going to Europe.\n\n01:40:08.660 --> 01:40:12.660\nAnd now, you know, France is probably, everyone's like scared of globalization.\n\n01:40:12.660 --> 01:40:13.660\nEveryone's scared of the other.\n\n01:40:13.660 --> 01:40:14.660\nEveryone's scared of anyone coming in.\n\n01:40:14.660 --> 01:40:19.660\nAnd this is a repeat of the things leading up to more scary than World War II, World War I,\n\n01:40:19.660 --> 01:40:25.660\nwhere isolationism, empty factories, economies in the toilet, everybody's starting to go,\n\n01:40:25.660 --> 01:40:26.660\nI'm going to stack weapons.\n\n01:40:26.660 --> 01:40:27.660\nYou guys stacking weapons?\n\n01:40:27.660 --> 01:40:33.660\nEverything starts internationally, fucking machismo, total cool, like a billiard table.\n\n01:40:33.660 --> 01:40:36.660\nYou guys going to stack weapons, stop doing trade?\n\n01:40:36.660 --> 01:40:38.660\nYeah, gotcha, man.\n\n01:40:38.660 --> 01:40:44.660\nLike next game, and it's like fucking like tanks, bombs, things, and everybody's like,\n\n01:40:44.660 --> 01:40:47.660\nWorld War I is scarier than World War II.\n\n01:40:47.660 --> 01:40:49.660\nAnd that's like a lot of that shit's leading to now.\n\n01:40:49.660 --> 01:40:52.660\nBut, however, here's the thing.\n\n01:40:52.660 --> 01:41:02.660\nAmerica during World War II, because it was so historically wounded by World War I,\n\n01:41:02.660 --> 01:41:08.660\nit was like, another one?\n\n01:41:08.660 --> 01:41:16.660\nAnd that led to like this rugged, sad, lonely, angry, like kind of hunched over dude who was like,\n\n01:41:16.660 --> 01:41:21.660\nlook, Nazi schmatze, all I see is a bunch of boats and a bunch of guns.\n\n01:41:21.660 --> 01:41:22.660\nYou want some metal?\n\n01:41:22.660 --> 01:41:23.660\nYou want some oil?\n\n01:41:23.660 --> 01:41:24.660\nCash only.\n\n01:41:24.660 --> 01:41:28.660\nI don't know, I'm not taking credit, because one of you might take over the world,\n\n01:41:28.660 --> 01:41:30.660\nand the other one's not going to pay their bill.\n\n01:41:30.660 --> 01:41:36.660\nAnd we were, at that moment in my opinion, just as a student of history, it's like,\n\n01:41:36.660 --> 01:41:38.660\nI love that America.\n\n01:41:38.660 --> 01:41:42.660\nI love that poor, wounded child that just wants to make money.\n\n01:41:42.660 --> 01:41:46.660\nAnd profit off both sides of a huge genocidal catastrophe.\n\n01:41:46.660 --> 01:41:54.660\nNo, but that thought that those oceans meant something, that before it went on to invent,\n\n01:41:54.660 --> 01:41:59.660\nthose oceans not meeting anything, with all of its innovation, and all of its greed,\n\n01:41:59.660 --> 01:42:00.660\nall of its self-indulgence.\n\n01:42:00.660 --> 01:42:06.660\nWe were a genius self-indulgent child locked in its bedroom, like so tired of the yelling,\n\n01:42:06.660 --> 01:42:12.660\nand then getting roped into more of it, and then we go, at our puberty at World War II,\n\n01:42:12.660 --> 01:42:14.660\nwe go, well, what's in it for us?\n\n01:42:14.660 --> 01:42:19.660\nBecause we're tired of being, you know, like, we've had the right idea the whole time,\n\n01:42:19.660 --> 01:42:22.660\nand you guys are just fucking around with this now, and we got dragged into this before.\n\n01:42:22.660 --> 01:42:26.660\nSo give me some money, give me some money, and then we jump in, and then we go to the thing,\n\n01:42:26.660 --> 01:42:29.660\nand we go, all right, fuck you, Nazis, you're dead, you're dead, you're dead.\n\n01:42:29.660 --> 01:42:31.660\nLet's get these filing cabinets out of here.\n\n01:42:31.660 --> 01:42:32.660\nWhoa, this drawer came open.\n\n01:42:32.660 --> 01:42:36.660\nShit, these guys were nailing it.\n\n01:42:36.660 --> 01:42:42.660\nTheir overhead was zero, and their profit was a thousand percent, because they were Nazis.\n\n01:42:42.660 --> 01:42:44.660\nMaybe we should bring this back overseas.\n\n01:42:44.660 --> 01:42:46.660\nEverything went to shit.\n\n01:42:46.660 --> 01:42:52.660\nThat's a fucking Alex Jones tangent that I don't want to...\n\n01:42:52.660 --> 01:42:54.660\nThere is hope, there is hope.\n\n01:42:54.660 --> 01:42:56.660\nWe don't have to repeat history, we don't have to do it.\n\n01:42:56.660 --> 01:42:59.660\nWe are living in the exact circumstances.\n\n01:42:59.660 --> 01:43:03.660\nThere's like a little bit of World War I, there's a little bit of World War II, these things building up.\n\n01:43:03.660 --> 01:43:06.660\nYeah, and fascism is on the rise globally right now.\n\n01:43:06.660 --> 01:43:11.660\nAmerica has always been in these little stories, well, because we learned from American history books,\n\n01:43:11.660 --> 01:43:13.660\nbut we're the star.\n\n01:43:13.660 --> 01:43:16.660\nWe have a certain position.\n\n01:43:16.660 --> 01:43:19.660\nI think Portugal is going to come back good and strong.\n\n01:43:19.660 --> 01:43:28.660\nWe might be the ones this time to say, I see more profit in war.\n\n01:43:28.660 --> 01:43:31.660\nThese bombs don't actually work, we were kidding.\n\n01:43:31.660 --> 01:43:32.660\nI don't think that's going to happen.\n\n01:43:32.660 --> 01:43:40.660\nI think if you draw a line from the beginning of empires to now, empires get big and they decline\n\n01:43:40.660 --> 01:43:45.660\nand they die really ignominious deaths and someone else takes over.\n\n01:43:45.660 --> 01:43:49.660\nAnd then there's fascism or totalitarianism.\n\n01:43:49.660 --> 01:43:53.660\nBut I think somebody that lived in a certain other time would say, look, we've all seen this before.\n\n01:43:53.660 --> 01:43:57.660\nThe dinosaurs come in, they eat the ostriches and then the ostriches turn into dinosaurs.\n\n01:43:57.660 --> 01:44:01.660\nAnd it's like, well, yeah, but at a certain point something goes extinct.\n\n01:44:01.660 --> 01:44:06.660\nSir, I would like to see your math on that one.\n\n01:44:06.660 --> 01:44:09.660\nNope, it's a new age, sir.\n\n01:44:09.660 --> 01:44:12.660\nYou were saying the dinosaurs ate the ostriches and became ostriches?\n\n01:44:12.660 --> 01:44:15.660\nSaying there's little details that can be different.\n\n01:44:15.660 --> 01:44:18.660\nWe might be able to be counted on as being the selfish ancient.\n\n01:44:18.660 --> 01:44:20.660\nBut they're not different, we're ancient Rome right now.\n\n01:44:20.660 --> 01:44:23.660\nWe're exactly the way that Spain fell.\n\n01:44:23.660 --> 01:44:28.660\nOnly when you pull so far back that you acknowledge that the pattern is that things get big and then they fart.\n\n01:44:28.660 --> 01:44:31.660\nThat's not brave to point out.\n\n01:44:31.660 --> 01:44:35.660\nCan we stop talking about you for one second, Daniel?\n\n01:44:35.660 --> 01:44:38.660\nIt seems like the difference in this case is that we can get together.\n\n01:44:38.660 --> 01:44:46.660\nIt's not as easy to say, oh, look, America is showing all the signs of a big global empire that's about to blow.\n\n01:44:46.660 --> 01:44:52.660\nIt doesn't have to just be resigned to.\n\n01:44:52.660 --> 01:44:59.660\nCertainly not, but I don't think any empire ever thought they were resigning to a fate.\n\n01:44:59.660 --> 01:45:03.660\nI think they always thought that that was going to last a thousand years or 10,000 years.\n\n01:45:03.660 --> 01:45:05.660\nI draw a circle around your circle.\n\n01:45:05.660 --> 01:45:08.660\nI'm just saying, like, every time...\n\n01:45:08.660 --> 01:45:10.660\nI draw a triangle inside my circle.\n\n01:45:10.660 --> 01:45:13.660\nPeople keep trying to learn from history and not learn from history.\n\n01:45:13.660 --> 01:45:16.660\nWe don't even know...\n\n01:45:16.660 --> 01:45:21.660\nThe empires that we're describing, we're adjusting for inflation and going,\n\n01:45:21.660 --> 01:45:24.660\nwell, it's been 300 years for America.\n\n01:45:24.660 --> 01:45:30.660\nMaybe we're supposed to become a planet by now, and it's supposed to be the planet that burns up into a cinder.\n\n01:45:30.660 --> 01:45:34.660\nBecause that was a shitty empire, and it turns out the bees were writing the history books.\n\n01:45:34.660 --> 01:45:39.660\nAnd then they just have one picture and it's just Michael Jackson.\n\n01:45:39.660 --> 01:45:41.660\nThat's our whole species.\n\n01:45:41.660 --> 01:45:43.660\nThey're like...\n\n01:45:43.660 --> 01:45:45.660\nThe book isn't even a book.\n\n01:45:45.660 --> 01:45:49.660\nIt's just like a series of things that emulate a thorax wiggle.\n\n01:45:49.660 --> 01:45:53.660\nBut when you read it, it's like an image.\n\n01:45:53.660 --> 01:45:55.660\nIt's the essence of Michael Jackson's pheromones.\n\n01:45:55.660 --> 01:45:58.660\nAnd only Jodie Foster can translate it.\n\n01:45:58.660 --> 01:46:00.660\nBut she's gone.\n\n01:46:00.660 --> 01:46:03.660\nBecause we didn't believe in ourselves.\n\n01:46:03.660 --> 01:46:04.660\nWhich is what I think we need to do.\n\n01:46:04.660 --> 01:46:06.660\nJodie Foster's dead.\n\n01:46:06.660 --> 01:46:09.660\nWe're all dead. It's just the bees now.\n\n01:46:09.660 --> 01:46:17.660\nYou don't even have to be an optimist to start trying to organize your little corner of the world for the right.\n\n01:46:17.660 --> 01:46:20.660\nBecause if you're a pessimist, follow that all the way through.\n\n01:46:20.660 --> 01:46:22.660\nOh yeah, the world's fucked.\n\n01:46:22.660 --> 01:46:23.660\nIt's the wild west.\n\n01:46:23.660 --> 01:46:26.660\nAny minute now, I might turn out to be a robot.\n\n01:46:26.660 --> 01:46:29.660\nA guy I'll find out when I get a bullet in my head.\n\n01:46:29.660 --> 01:46:35.660\nTherefore, obviously, then don't die a douche.\n\n01:46:35.660 --> 01:46:39.660\nGo down swinging if a Nazi is going to kill you.\n\n01:46:39.660 --> 01:46:43.660\nI'm learning how to wrap barbed wire around a two by four.\n\n01:46:43.660 --> 01:46:48.660\nAnd later, I'm going to learn how to lift it.\n\n01:46:48.660 --> 01:46:50.660\nBut I'm hoping that when they get there, I'm going to go,\n\n01:46:50.660 --> 01:46:53.660\nGuys, look. Look what I can do.\n\n01:46:53.660 --> 01:46:56.660\nYou guys got barbed wire?\n\n01:46:56.660 --> 01:46:59.660\nYou got Nazi work to do?\n\n01:46:59.660 --> 01:47:03.660\nI'm your man. They call me Barbie, Barbie Tuba.\n\n01:47:03.660 --> 01:47:05.660\nShow me to your ammo dump.\n\n01:47:05.660 --> 01:47:08.660\nLet me show you what I can do when I got some real resources.\n\n01:47:08.660 --> 01:47:11.660\nAnd then I get in there and I go full fucking homeland.\n\n01:47:11.660 --> 01:47:14.660\nHow do you connect?\n\n01:47:14.660 --> 01:47:20.660\nWhen you find, I'm assuming you just scrounged your barbed wire and your two by four.\n\n01:47:20.660 --> 01:47:24.660\nHow do you connect the barbed wire onto the end of the two by four?\n\n01:47:24.660 --> 01:47:27.660\nThe teeth sink into the wood as you wrap it around.\n\n01:47:27.660 --> 01:47:30.660\nYou just have to wear really thick gloves.\n\n01:47:30.660 --> 01:47:33.660\nThe trick isn't to figure out how to attach barbed wire to wood.\n\n01:47:33.660 --> 01:47:38.660\nBarbed wire is effective because it'll go through anything you hand it.\n\n01:47:38.660 --> 01:47:43.660\nThat's why you need to work with baseball gloves.\n\n01:47:43.660 --> 01:47:45.660\nAll of it's available from Amazon.\n\n01:47:45.660 --> 01:47:48.660\nI'm not here to do like an anarchist cookbook.\n\n01:47:48.660 --> 01:47:51.660\nYou're going to find a couple of baseball gloves.\n\n01:47:51.660 --> 01:47:56.660\nEverything that you guys need to know about my political police as of this election\n\n01:47:56.660 --> 01:47:59.660\ncan be heard in the Mike and the Mechanic song Silent Running.\n\n01:47:59.660 --> 01:48:01.660\nGo home and listen to it.\n\n01:48:01.660 --> 01:48:08.660\nPledge allegiance to the flag, whatever flag they offer.\n\n01:48:08.660 --> 01:48:11.660\nGood song. Good song.\n\n01:48:11.660 --> 01:48:13.660\nGo back to Blondie.\n\n01:48:13.660 --> 01:48:15.660\nJust guys, really guys.\n\n01:48:15.660 --> 01:48:18.660\nDid you really, did you know her?\n\n01:48:18.660 --> 01:48:21.660\nI think we just got a guy back that likes Blondie a lot.\n\n01:48:21.660 --> 01:48:22.660\nYeah.\n\n01:48:22.660 --> 01:48:23.660\nYeah.\n\n01:48:23.660 --> 01:48:28.660\nYour Blondie is attention.\n\n01:48:28.660 --> 01:48:31.660\nAnd these people have been, they have Blondies.\n\n01:48:31.660 --> 01:48:36.660\nAll right, my Blondie is being a handicapped person that have been a big joke tonight.\n\n01:48:36.660 --> 01:48:41.660\nBut I guess, I guess, I guess walks a lot can talk for all he wants.\n\n01:48:41.660 --> 01:48:44.660\nDan, I met a friend here, his name is Sylvon.\n\n01:48:44.660 --> 01:48:47.660\nHe's from Paris, met him today.\n\n01:48:47.660 --> 01:48:52.660\nHe reminded me that today is the one, today is the one year anniversary of the Paris attacks.\n\n01:48:52.660 --> 01:48:56.660\nAnd he's traveling the states by himself right now cruising around.\n\n01:48:56.660 --> 01:48:59.660\nAnd he couldn't have picked a more fun week to be.\n\n01:48:59.660 --> 01:49:03.660\nWell, also you're worried in, is it in France?\n\n01:49:03.660 --> 01:49:09.660\nThere's like white, not white, there's like racial nationalism like popping up all over the globe, right?\n\n01:49:09.660 --> 01:49:11.660\nMarine Le Pen.\n\n01:49:11.660 --> 01:49:13.660\nIs it in France?\n\n01:49:13.660 --> 01:49:15.660\nHere, grab a microphone.\n\n01:49:15.660 --> 01:49:19.660\nBecause all of us in America are going, France is fancy.\n\n01:49:19.660 --> 01:49:21.660\nThey never go Nazi.\n\n01:49:21.660 --> 01:49:22.660\nThat's how young we are.\n\n01:49:22.660 --> 01:49:26.660\nNo, things are getting weirder since the last year.\n\n01:49:26.660 --> 01:49:32.660\nI don't know if there are more races, but there are more ways for them to express their racism, I guess.\n\n01:49:32.660 --> 01:49:35.660\nAnd we have an election in one year.\n\n01:49:35.660 --> 01:49:39.660\nSo politicians are being politicians, I guess.\n\n01:49:39.660 --> 01:49:42.660\nBut yeah, so it's getting pretty weird.\n\n01:49:42.660 --> 01:49:49.660\nAnd I guess with this election, we feel, I mean, from the social media today, like, I guess, yeah.\n\n01:49:49.660 --> 01:49:52.660\nWe weren't expecting that result from the US.\n\n01:49:52.660 --> 01:49:58.660\nAnd then it's kind of scare everybody because everybody is like, hey, we shouldn't like do that next year.\n\n01:49:58.660 --> 01:50:07.660\nBut it's getting, maybe, I don't think we're going to elect somebody that is as maybe obviously racist than yours.\n\n01:50:07.660 --> 01:50:15.660\nBut it would be the same, like, maybe we have different codes so you cannot say the same things.\n\n01:50:15.660 --> 01:50:18.660\nBut it doesn't mean that the people don't really think the same.\n\n01:50:18.660 --> 01:50:21.660\nSo, and it's, yeah, I think it's pretty much the same.\n\n01:50:21.660 --> 01:50:27.660\nLike in Paris, you don't, I guess, feel it as much as in LA or San Francisco or like New York.\n\n01:50:27.660 --> 01:50:34.660\nBut then you're, yeah, you have to have this big of an event to realize what's going on.\n\n01:50:34.660 --> 01:50:40.660\nThat we're living in this world, like, I don't know how old you are, but all of us really, I'm always talking about, oh, you're 25 and 45.\n\n01:50:40.660 --> 01:50:47.660\nLike, all of us can be grouped into one group of people who, all of the kind of shit that we're thinking about right now,\n\n01:50:47.660 --> 01:50:50.660\nall of us thought of it as something from history books.\n\n01:50:50.660 --> 01:50:52.660\nLike, we all watched, we all looked at pictures of it.\n\n01:50:52.660 --> 01:51:00.660\nAnd there's something a little exciting about that for mostly straight white dudes who love sliders.\n\n01:51:00.660 --> 01:51:04.660\nWhich is because it's like, we're, oh, we're a sliders.\n\n01:51:04.660 --> 01:51:08.660\nAnyway, thank you, thank you, Frenchie. That was nice.\n\n01:51:08.660 --> 01:51:10.660\nFrenchie!\n\n01:51:10.660 --> 01:51:12.660\nThank you, Siobhan.\n\n01:51:12.660 --> 01:51:21.660\nI hope that your experience with America that you're traveling on this trip has been a positive one and not a horribly depressing one.\n\n01:51:21.660 --> 01:51:23.660\nThere's one guy, I know it's 10 o'clock.\n\n01:51:23.660 --> 01:51:30.660\nThere's one guy, scared to not bring him up, because like, I've seen his tweets, he's like calling out.\n\n01:51:30.660 --> 01:51:32.660\nIs it you?\n\n01:51:32.660 --> 01:51:34.660\nI don't know.\n\n01:51:34.660 --> 01:51:38.660\nI don't, it wasn't, but it is now.\n\n01:51:38.660 --> 01:51:40.660\nHey, BJ, how are you?\n\n01:51:40.660 --> 01:51:42.660\nBut BJ, how's it going?\n\n01:51:42.660 --> 01:51:44.660\nIt's BJ Abril.\n\n01:51:44.660 --> 01:51:49.660\nWow, BJ, wearing a silver Mylar space suit.\n\n01:51:49.660 --> 01:51:55.660\nOkay, well, I mean, is there, is there a soundbite that goes with it, or could it just be a photo app?\n\n01:51:55.660 --> 01:51:56.660\nI'm from the future.\n\n01:51:56.660 --> 01:51:58.660\nOkay, do you have anything to tell us from the future?\n\n01:51:58.660 --> 01:52:02.660\nYou can use, don't use my mic, I need control.\n\n01:52:02.660 --> 01:52:04.660\nYeah, everything's great.\n\n01:52:04.660 --> 01:52:06.660\nOkay, all right.\n\n01:52:06.660 --> 01:52:07.660\nAll right, BJ, thanks for coming up.\n\n01:52:07.660 --> 01:52:08.660\nAll right.\n\n01:52:08.660 --> 01:52:11.660\nThank you.\n\n01:52:11.660 --> 01:52:13.660\nIt is interesting.\n\n01:52:13.660 --> 01:52:15.660\nHe was always very seven years old.\n\n01:52:15.660 --> 01:52:17.660\nThat was the most man camel toe I've ever seen.\n\n01:52:17.660 --> 01:52:19.660\nHere's the guy.\n\n01:52:19.660 --> 01:52:22.660\nYou ever only seen camel toe until this BJ silver camel toe?\n\n01:52:22.660 --> 01:52:25.660\nI don't want to rule out anybody that says this right now, because I don't have the solutions.\n\n01:52:25.660 --> 01:52:30.660\nThere was a kid guy who was tweeting me, all people are kids to me, 43.\n\n01:52:30.660 --> 01:52:35.660\nWhat, you had a human party, you wanted to start a political party, where are you?\n\n01:52:35.660 --> 01:52:36.660\nWhat's, no?\n\n01:52:36.660 --> 01:52:37.660\nAre you here?\n\n01:52:37.660 --> 01:52:38.660\nYou didn't even come to the show.\n\n01:52:38.660 --> 01:52:39.660\nOkay.\n\n01:52:39.660 --> 01:52:40.660\nOh, is that a rent that's too high?\n\n01:52:40.660 --> 01:52:41.660\nNot exactly George Washington.\n\n01:52:41.660 --> 01:52:43.660\nI guess we don't have to follow him.\n\n01:52:43.660 --> 01:52:48.660\nI thought I saw some tweets from him, like several, it was like, I'm starting a human party.\n\n01:52:48.660 --> 01:52:49.660\nI'll come to the show.\n\n01:52:49.660 --> 01:52:50.660\nI'll talk about it.\n\n01:52:50.660 --> 01:52:53.660\nAnd I'm like, all right, well, you know, he'll probably be a drag.\n\n01:52:53.660 --> 01:52:57.660\nBut then I was like, I was feeling, I was like, let's bring him up.\n\n01:52:57.660 --> 01:52:58.660\nHe's been so quiet.\n\n01:52:58.660 --> 01:53:00.660\nHe didn't come.\n\n01:53:00.660 --> 01:53:05.660\nI say that a human party won't come unless you respond to their tweets.\n\n01:53:05.660 --> 01:53:06.660\nYeah.\n\n01:53:06.660 --> 01:53:10.660\nAnd that's why humans need to be forgiven for being shitty.\n\n01:53:10.660 --> 01:53:15.660\nI say we re-invoke the babes, the funky music, and we maybe sing our way out of this thing.\n\n01:53:15.660 --> 01:53:16.660\nYeah, of course.\n\n01:53:16.660 --> 01:53:23.660\nWell, we're not going to vote our way out of a show.\n\n01:53:23.660 --> 01:53:28.660\nDon't vote boo.\n\n01:53:28.660 --> 01:53:30.660\nI hope that's not the message you.\n\n01:53:30.660 --> 01:53:35.660\nI don't know what message you should have gotten.\n\n01:53:35.660 --> 01:53:40.660\nWe got kind of a funky Leonard Cohen rap going on here right now.\n\n01:53:40.660 --> 01:53:41.660\nYo.\n\n01:53:41.660 --> 01:53:42.660\nYeah.\n\n01:53:42.660 --> 01:53:46.660\nWell, actually, you know, why rap?\n\n01:53:46.660 --> 01:53:47.660\nSame.\n\n01:53:47.660 --> 01:53:57.660\nSunshine comes before nighttime.\n\n01:53:57.660 --> 01:54:01.660\nOr is it the other way around?\n\n01:54:01.660 --> 01:54:06.660\nWhen the time goes round, does day come before night?\n\n01:54:06.660 --> 01:54:16.660\nOr does night come before day?\n\n01:54:16.660 --> 01:54:22.660\nOur funky mama on a beach.\n\n01:54:22.660 --> 01:54:26.660\nYeah.\n\n01:54:26.660 --> 01:54:28.660\nLizzie, you want to take a pic?\n\n01:54:28.660 --> 01:54:29.660\nNope.\n\n01:54:29.660 --> 01:54:30.660\nShe's got it.\n\n01:54:30.660 --> 01:54:31.660\nYou got this?\n\n01:54:31.660 --> 01:54:32.660\nYo.\n\n01:54:32.660 --> 01:54:33.660\nTake it, baby.\n\n01:54:33.660 --> 01:54:34.660\nI figured I'd give it to you.\n\n01:54:34.660 --> 01:54:35.660\nNo, take it.\n\n01:54:35.660 --> 01:54:38.660\nAre you sure you don't want to hold it for just a second?\n\n01:54:38.660 --> 01:54:39.660\nYo.\n\n01:54:39.660 --> 01:54:40.660\nSunshine, brightly.\n\n01:54:40.660 --> 01:54:41.660\nI do.\n\n01:54:41.660 -->

do?\n\n01:54:45.660 --> 01:54:46.660\nI'll go.\n\n01:54:46.660 --> 01:54:47.660\nI'll go as free as I can be.\n\n01:54:47.660 --> 01:54:59.660\nI don't like a dude who's better dressed than me.\n\n01:54:59.660 --> 01:55:00.660\nSunshine.\n\n01:55:00.660 --> 01:55:03.660\nBut yo, it's time for all of us to put our best suit on.\n\n01:55:03.660 --> 01:55:05.660\nBe the best purple you could be.\n\n01:55:05.660 --> 01:55:08.660\nRecruitant people looking better than you.\n\n01:55:08.660 --> 01:55:09.660\nPut a suit on.\n\n01:55:09.660 --> 01:55:11.660\nYo, navy blue is where to go.\n\n01:55:11.660 --> 01:55:12.660\nSunshine.\n\n01:55:12.660 --> 01:55:13.660\nWhere do I begin?\n\n01:55:13.660 --> 01:55:14.660\nAnd my man is over there.\n\n01:55:14.660 --> 01:55:15.660\nNo wrinkle on your linen.\n\n01:55:15.660 --> 01:55:18.660\nHow do you wear a linen suit and get no wrinkles on it?\n\n01:55:18.660 --> 01:55:22.660\nYo, I got a bee in my bonnet.\n\n01:55:22.660 --> 01:55:23.660\nNicely done.\n\n01:55:23.660 --> 01:55:24.660\nYeah.\n\n01:55:24.660 --> 01:55:29.660\nSunshine comes before night time.\n\n01:55:29.660 --> 01:55:32.660\nOr is it the other way around?\n\n01:55:32.660 --> 01:55:35.660\nAll the time goes around.\n\n01:55:35.660 --> 01:55:41.660\nWhen sunshine comes before night time, it's the refrain.\n\n01:55:41.660 --> 01:55:46.660\nYo, my name is Mr. Bitch.\n\n01:55:46.660 --> 01:55:48.660\nOn my shoulder.\n\n01:55:48.660 --> 01:55:50.660\nI don't belong here.\n\n01:55:50.660 --> 01:55:51.660\nNo.\n\n01:55:51.660 --> 01:55:52.660\nNo.\n\n01:55:52.660 --> 01:55:57.660\nI'm making a sacrificial gesture to not be involved because my energy is toxic.\n\n01:55:57.660 --> 01:56:00.660\nMy name is Mr.
