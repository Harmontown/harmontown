00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
Let's hear for Babes, everybody.

00:10.000 --> 00:11.000
Babes!

00:11.000 --> 00:26.000
The Springhouse Spencer Crittin' in everybody's home in town is now in session.

00:26.000 --> 00:29.000
Keep it going, Babes.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
Keep rockin'!

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
Yeah!

00:40.000 --> 00:45.000
Let's bring out the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
Yeah!

00:48.000 --> 00:53.000
Yeah!

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
Thank you!

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
I like it.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
Thanks, Babes.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
Babes Band?

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
Babes.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
Babes?

01:12.000 --> 01:17.000
Babes Band is your Twitter handle because you're not 70 years old.

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
So Babes was taken when you started your Twitter account.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
Somebody probably got on the ground floor at Babes.

01:23.000 --> 01:27.000
Are you starting the show as Ed 209 tonight?

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
Is it not?

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
Oh.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
You couldn't hear that?

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
No, I can't.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
To me, my voice sounds normal this time.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
Listen for it.

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
Alright, let's get started.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
So it's unorthodox.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
Where Spencer normally dwells, we have a band of four people.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
Yeah, I noticed that too.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
And now...

01:56.000 --> 02:00.000
Spencer is now sitting over here in kind of Kumail Nanjiani territory.

02:00.000 --> 02:05.000
Yeah, I feel like I get where he was coming from now, sitting on this side of the stage.

02:05.000 --> 02:10.000
I just feel like I'm together and we gotta, you know, talk to Dan over here.

02:10.000 --> 02:16.000
But it's great, I mean, he definitely rose to beyond Kumail or even Harmon status in New York.

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
Like, for those of you who heard the New York show, Spencer did a great job.

02:19.000 --> 02:23.000
We were Jeffalus and Spencer stepped up.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
Thank you.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
Good job.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
Yeah, and then we elected a Nazi.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
I don't know if that was gonna come up tonight.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
I was out of town.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
What happened?

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
It was a squeaker.

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
I kept saying the media was gonna make it seem like a squeaker.

02:41.000 --> 02:48.000
That makes the 23rd out of 23 political predictions I've been wrong about.

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
Starting with, we'll never see a black president in my lifetime.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
Like, I really said that before.

02:53.000 --> 02:58.000
I was talked into believing that first that it was gonna be really tight, but then towards the end,

02:58.000 --> 03:02.000
we were talked into the idea that it was in the bag for Hillary.

03:02.000 --> 03:06.000
And of course, I said a few times, he was gonna win it, he was gonna win it.

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
Not that I wanted him to, or I don't even like putting that out there.

03:09.000 --> 03:15.000
I do kind of believe in the words you say, like, can manifest themselves in some way.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
You know, like, they can create things.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
I do believe that.

03:18.000 --> 03:23.000
I also really felt that it was an increasing possibility all the time.

03:23.000 --> 03:29.000
And, like, I was in London during, like, the week and a half before the Brexit vote.

03:29.000 --> 03:33.000
And depending on who you talk to, most people are like, oh, no, it's not gonna happen.

03:33.000 --> 03:38.000
It's not gonna happen. And you talk to anybody that was working class like, it's happening.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
And it was gonna happen.

03:41.000 --> 03:47.000
Well, yeah, and we get, I'm to the election, I'll be permeating tonight as a theme, I'm sure.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
Including the analysis of the statistics and stuff.

03:50.000 --> 03:59.000
But I, to me, what I am keen to talk about, because it's most scary, most promising, most exciting to me,

03:59.000 --> 04:06.000
is the cultural, not ramifications, but the cultural thing that's happening,

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
of which I think this election is a symptom.

04:09.000 --> 04:15.000
Because it's a real thing that we have to deal with on our sidewalks and things,

04:15.000 --> 04:21.000
and in conversations with each other, the people with actual human hearts and brains that we touch,

04:21.000 --> 04:26.000
and whose breath we can smell, and who are renting properties to or from us,

04:26.000 --> 04:30.000
and who we buy and sell bread to.

04:30.000 --> 04:35.000
I haven't been into the market in a while, and I don't know how commerce works.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
I pay people to count my filthy money.

04:37.000 --> 04:44.000
But the human beings are neighbors and things, and douchebags.

04:44.000 --> 04:51.000
We know that our friend Kumeil had an incident at a bar.

04:51.000 --> 04:59.000
These young douches that got drunk, and they were like...

04:59.000 --> 05:04.000
I guess it turns out later, in the analysis afterward of this story,

05:04.000 --> 05:10.000
the bartender was filling them in and saying that they have alt-right meetings over at this certain bar.

05:10.000 --> 05:15.000
I guess I won't name, because I'm not sure what I'd be doing by naming the bar,

05:15.000 --> 05:20.000
but that they have alt-right meetings in the back room, and that this is a bar close by,

05:20.000 --> 05:24.000
and that one of those two guys had been there before.

05:24.000 --> 05:29.000
It's not like Clockwork Orange, where it's like, holy shit, the fabric of society is changing necessarily,

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
just because of that story.

05:31.000 --> 05:35.000
But in case you didn't see it, the story was that Kumeil and Thomas Middleton were hanging out at a bar,

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
and two guys that had been drinking for a couple hours came up to them and said,

05:39.000 --> 05:43.000
hey, we're big fans, and I disagree with what you say on Twitter about Trump,

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
and then they said, let's not talk about politics.

05:46.000 --> 05:51.000
And they said, what are you, a cock, cock, cock, cock? And they started chanting the word cock,

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
which, if that's going to happen, I...

05:54.000 --> 06:00.000
I didn't know that that was an alt-right term for people that have been, what, cuckolded by politics?

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
Like, what is the angle on that?

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
It's just an attack on, I think, masculinity.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
Oh, that you're not a man.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
You're just like a beta male.

06:09.000 --> 06:14.000
I think it's more of a beta male thing to really focus on the sex life of other people.

06:14.000 --> 06:20.000
But again, I don't know if you've seen cuckold porn, but there's this guy, Marcello,

06:20.000 --> 06:24.000
who's a cuckold who is very alpha.

06:24.000 --> 06:30.000
He fucking like, he cuckolds himself so much that he owns the room.

06:30.000 --> 06:35.000
Like, I got no beef with a guy that's so low status,

06:35.000 --> 06:39.000
he can suck another man's penis while that man fucks his wife.

06:39.000 --> 06:43.000
Like, I think that guy's pretty fucking intimidating.

06:43.000 --> 06:48.000
And she goes like, lick my balls, slave, and he's like,

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
and his eyes are just dead.

06:51.000 --> 06:56.000
And I'm like, this fucking guy, like, I'm following him into battle.

06:56.000 --> 07:00.000
Not somebody who's like, what'd you say?

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
Like, this guy's cool under fire.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
He's licking balls.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
You're not supposed to want to do that if a guy's fucking your wife.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
That's the last thing.

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
You know, he's topping from the bottom, though. Like, he likes it.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
Like, he's in charge.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
He's eating the world from hell.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
Yeah, I don't know what you're talking about.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
He's amazing.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
He's my hero in that.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
I just did a comedy show last night.

07:22.000 --> 07:26.000
The gig was in Escondido, California, kind of down San Diego way,

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
like South of Carlsbad.

07:28.000 --> 07:32.000
But we stayed in Rancho Santa Fe, which is quite rich and white.

07:32.000 --> 07:36.000
And I went to have breakfast or lunch yesterday,

07:36.000 --> 07:40.000
and there was this woman that came in, and she was like, very Orange County,

07:40.000 --> 07:46.000
like, you know, I'd just picture a wealthy Orange County middle-aged woman

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
who was pretending to be 19.

07:48.000 --> 07:51.000
And she was quite loud, and they were all talking about Chardonnay

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
and varietals of grapes, because they're all wine people.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
And it was fine.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
I was reading my book, so I was pissed off.

07:56.000 --> 08:00.000
But that's my fault for reading a book at a bar and expecting silence.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
And then she started talking.

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
I thought you hated yourself for reading, or...

08:04.000 --> 08:08.000
I thought you were going, and here I am reading.

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
I like reading alone at a bar or at a restaurant,

08:11.000 --> 08:15.000
and I expect graveyard silence, which is self-destructive.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
It's stupid.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
But I do bring earplugs, but then I'm like,

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
I'm not wearing earplugs in a bar.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
Everybody has a right to look at me and go,

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
this guy is a fucking piece of shit.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
And I can dig it.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
But it was totally silent for the first 45 minutes I was there.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
Then this woman came and was talking to two other people,

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
and they were talking about grapes and wines,

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
and then she's like, oh, my daughter's got married,

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
and so my son-in-law is so amazing.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
He's a marine.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
And they have a dog, and the dog is named Mary,

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
but she's short for America.

08:42.000 --> 08:49.000
And I was, as I drove down there, when you pass the orange curtain,

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
when you get down into good and proper Orange County,

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
it's Trump stickers and forward F-150s and all that jazz.

08:54.000 --> 08:59.000
But then they all started talking in hushed tones about politics, about the election.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
They were all Hillary people.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
They sounded like they were going to be Trumpies.

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
But then I heard another guy, later on, football was on,

09:06.000 --> 09:10.000
a white guy with his white girlfriend or wife,

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
and an interception happened.

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
And he yelled, oh, god damn, are you fucking monkey?

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
And I was the only one that heard it.

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
And I just turned my mind, whoa!

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
And he goes, oh, whoa, whoa, why do you assume

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
I was talking about an African-American?

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
I said, whoa!

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
Double, whoa!

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
That's a meadow, whoa!

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
And I said, I'm watching the same TV you are, man.

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
And he goes, you fucking jackass.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
He mutters to his wife, he's a fucking jackass.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
What other words are you going to take away from us?

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
Yeah.

09:44.000 --> 09:48.000
So then I said, oh, I'm going to guess you voted for Trump.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
He goes, no, we voted for Hillary.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
Exactly.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
So, thank you.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
He felt activated, I felt.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
I feel that.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
I'm not Kumail Nanjiani, and I'm not brown.

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
And I didn't get poked in my chest by some, you know,

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
some alt-right weirdos.

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
I just feel like that was the first time I've ever heard,

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
like a bunch of, somebody felt that comfortable

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
to yell that out.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
And also, strangely righteous indignation when I,

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
like, I didn't go, hey, fuck you, racist!

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
I didn't say that.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
I went like, wow!

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
Right.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
And he's fucking racist in his head.

10:20.000 --> 10:23.000
So that's what I want to talk about tonight.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
I'm very proud of myself.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
I lined up some guests that are not based on like,

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
oh, this person represents this, that.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
In keeping with that, I invited random people

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
that I came across.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
They better be all white males.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
They aren't.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
But I do, before we, I do want to say before we,

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
because tonight is going to be, if I have anything to do with it,

10:42.000 --> 10:46.000
it's about moving forward into, like, I don't care.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
Don't, if you're listening to this and you're offended

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
by a straight white dude saying,

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
we need to erase the lines and solidaries,

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
not kidding us anywhere, I'm not telling you

10:56.000 --> 11:03.000
not to see lines, and I'm going to express that

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
where I'm at and how I'm going to move forward

11:06.000 --> 11:10.000
the best way I think I can help and use my I statements.

11:10.000 --> 11:14.000
I am certainly not here to tell, particularly especially

11:14.000 --> 11:18.000
the last person I want to tell not to see things in lines

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
are the black women in our family tonight,

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
because I feel like that was an astounding,

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
almost comedically absurd story.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
Like, if you looked at the statistics

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
and you were looking at lines and how they broke down,

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
that was a bummer.

11:33.000 --> 11:37.000
Like, they lined up and they were like, yep,

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
what you see is what you get, voting for Hillary,

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
she's not, she's a woman and I'm a woman

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
and there's a million reasons, blah, blah, blah,

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
and they came home and it's like, let's get our lady,

11:49.000 --> 11:55.000
what the fuck, you honky bitches.

11:55.000 --> 11:59.000
42% of the women vote went for Trump, is that right?

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
Yeah, I don't even know.

12:01.000 --> 12:05.000
We've all seen the spreadsheets that have befuddled us,

12:05.000 --> 12:09.000
and then we searched for meeting with our primate mind.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
I trusted Jake Tapper.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
You lied.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
I think the message from those spreadsheets,

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
from this election, from everything,

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
was going like, oh, thank God,

12:19.000 --> 12:23.000
it may be in a very twisted, horrible balloon animal way,

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
but Martin Luther King finally just actually became,

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
his dream is actually becoming a little bit true,

12:28.000 --> 12:32.000
because I cannot look at anybody anymore

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
or think about anybody based on any group that they belong to

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
and assume anything about them.

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
I think that election, it's like,

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
you can now say that you have more in common

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
with a person you haven't met yet

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
than some of the people you've met.

12:46.000 --> 12:49.000
You can now say that you have more important things in common

12:49.000 --> 12:52.000
with people who have superficial things not in common with you,

12:52.000 --> 12:57.000
and I don't want to speak for my people that are shaped like me,

12:57.000 --> 13:01.000
but before that Tuesday, I was walking around thinking that

13:01.000 --> 13:05.000
the idea that biology didn't matter, race, gender,

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
to name a few bio lines,

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
there's a million of them though,

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
the things that just make us different,

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
like in the goo that makes up our body.

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
The idea that that stuff didn't matter,

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
I always looked at it like broccoli,

13:18.000 --> 13:21.000
like really healthy, really hard to commit to,

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
like not the first choice,

13:23.000 --> 13:27.000
like when I'm secretly thinking about what I'd rather do,

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
like kind of difficult, worth it,

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
we'll make everything better,

13:31.000 --> 13:35.000
oh so hard to do and no one else is going to do it anyway.

13:35.000 --> 13:40.000
And after Tuesday, like I swear it's not hyperbole,

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
it was just like the one good thing for me,

13:42.000 --> 13:45.000
was I was like holy shit no,

13:45.000 --> 13:49.000
the idea that you can't tell what people are thinking or feeling

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
or where they're coming from by looking at them,

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
is not like broccoli, it's like air,

13:54.000 --> 13:58.000
it's impossible now to not be in that mindset,

13:58.000 --> 14:02.000
it's absolutely vital and it's relatively empty

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
and we have to fill it with something meaningful.

14:04.000 --> 14:07.000
I know that was a dumb way to extend that metaphor,

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
I should have stopped that,

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
it just went from being like,

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
oh you should really do that, okay I will,

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
and walking around like that monkey guy,

14:14.000 --> 14:18.000
who clearly was yelling at himself before you did,

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
he was yelling at all this shit,

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
you were yelling at him for being a resident,

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
that guy's already, we got this fucking

14:24.000 --> 14:27.000
World Wrestling Federation wrapped up in our brains

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
because we're surrounded by it anyway,

14:29.000 --> 14:32.000
so the big question becomes,

14:32.000 --> 14:37.000
how do we stop being surprised by shit,

14:37.000 --> 14:40.000
how do we, that was my therapist's advice,

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
stop expressing yourself with like,

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
Dan you keep going like this,

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
and your voice keeps going up in the air,

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
because you keep going,

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
there's a swastikop over the house in San Francisco,

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
can you believe what you did to you,

14:51.000 --> 14:54.000
and the white women that you knew I was?

14:54.000 --> 14:58.000
It's all in that context of can you fucking believe it,

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
can you believe it,

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
and you hear that story about Camille,

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
and that always the unspoken thing on Twitter

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
is like when you retweet stuff,

15:05.000 --> 15:08.000
you do, the unspoken message of it is like,

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
can you believe this,

15:09.000 --> 15:14.000
and that for the last 20 years has been enough,

15:14.000 --> 15:17.000
like that has been our definition of the guillotine,

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
it's been our definition of like,

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
just like transparency,

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
of rule of law socially,

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
because there are no laws against like,

15:25.000 --> 15:30.000
having weird feelings about you ate three bananas,

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
now you're a woman,

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
you can have like these fucked up ideas

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
that if a Supreme Court justice has them,

15:35.000 --> 15:38.000
bananas, illegal, and we're like, whoa, hey,

15:38.000 --> 15:41.000
those thoughts aren't illegal,

15:41.000 --> 15:45.000
and so we have up until now had the luxury of going,

15:45.000 --> 15:49.000
can you believe this person feels this way?

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
Now it seems clear to me that it's like,

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
oh, you gotta believe it,

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
you gotta believe it,

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
and coming with that is like,

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
then if you're going like this,

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
you're the sucker,

16:00.000 --> 16:03.000
like can you believe this guy's mugging me?

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
Well, yeah, Steven Segal can,

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
that's why he's not getting mugged anymore.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
What a terrible example,

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
you guys don't admire Steven Segal?

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
I'm 43, he was like really,

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
he was bad ass,

16:14.000 --> 16:18.000
for like six months of 92, I think.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
I couldn't think of a name of a guy

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
who's famous for not getting mugged.

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
What, I forget,

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
maybe I remember,

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
I'm not sure if I know the exact order

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
of the five stages of grief,

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
but do you know which Spencer or Dan,

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
do you know which one you're in right now?

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
Well, I'm,

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
I'm gonna assume not acceptance yet.

16:37.000 --> 16:40.000
Well, or you could say either this grief doesn't apply

16:40.000 --> 16:43.000
or I'm all the way to acceptance

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
because we need to do more than grief.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
If our friend is getting harassed in a bar,

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
we don't have to go grab our muskets,

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
we don't have to go,

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
because we don't know those guys represent the alt-right,

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
we don't know what the alt-right is,

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
we don't know, we just, we have to,

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
we have to straighten our backs,

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
square our shoulders,

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
take a deep breath in, go,

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
this is happening.

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
Like, like, there are skinheads,

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
there are angry people,

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
there are people you can't,

17:09.000 --> 17:12.000
every person that is walking toward you,

17:12.000 --> 17:15.000
it has either dynamite

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
or pudding,

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
or pudding being a good thing,

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
like the opposite of dynamite.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
But it's a bad thing to have in your head

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
because you need to think.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
So, again, my metaphors are failing,

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
but I'm saying every person that you encounter

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
could be explosive,

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
or a god, or a monster,

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
but very likely something

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
incredibly sloppy and unpredictable

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
in between that is going to require,

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
like, very, very,

17:42.000 --> 17:45.000
like, in the moment negotiation

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
and also, though, before you enter

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
that chaotic world,

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
an agreement about how we behave,

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
for instance, when I've seen some pictograms

17:53.000 --> 17:56.000
that were being posted that I thought were kind of cool,

17:56.000 --> 17:59.000
it's like, what do you do when you see

17:59.000 --> 18:02.000
a dude bullying a Muslim woman on a subway

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
and it, like, shows you in pictograms,

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
like, what you should do?

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
It turns out what you should do

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
is walk up to the Muslim woman,

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
start hanging out with her

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
as if the guy doesn't exist,

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
and as if you've known her for 20 years.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
Hey, how are you?

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
I haven't seen you in a while.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
I mean, probably, you know,

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
it's better than going like,

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
get your hands off her!

18:20.000 --> 18:24.000
I got sidetracked by that.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
Are you saying, I mean, yeah,

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
I mean, we should all, like,

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
if I saw someone doing that,

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
I would absolutely go up there

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
and intervene and step in

18:32.000 --> 18:35.000
at the risk of getting, like, punched, like...

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
Well, I...

18:36.000 --> 18:37.000
But the thing is, I don't know,

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
I would piss my pants and cry

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
and so I want to talk to people

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
who don't know how,

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
it's like, I feel like you're bragging.

18:43.000 --> 18:47.000
Well, no, I mean,

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
I'm saying hypothetically because

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
it's always been a hypothetical.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
Now, I don't think it's going to keep

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
being a hypothetical.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
I think it's going to be something

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
that you're going to run into a lot now.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
I want to plan for it

18:58.000 --> 19:01.000
and I'm going to need powerful friends, Jeff.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
Powerful, powerful friends.

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
From the Marvel Universe,

19:06.000 --> 19:09.000
you know her as the Red Sorceress.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
Now it's Scarlet Witch.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
It's Elizabeth Olsen!

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
Hit it, babes!

19:14.000 --> 19:33.000
Yeah.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
The obvious joke to make is like,

19:35.000 --> 19:39.000
hey, could you use your signature Marvel power

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
to undo that election?

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
But I've seen two movies now

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
and I can't figure out what your signature power is.

19:45.000 --> 19:48.000
It seems like you can do anything to anyone,

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
but it involves red light.

19:49.000 --> 19:52.000
Yeah, that's as much as I understand.

19:52.000 --> 19:56.000
And I think at some point,

19:56.000 --> 20:01.000
I get to manipulate time, I think,

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
at least in the comics.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
Oh, good, because your character was kind of weak,

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
so I was hoping they would give me...

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
Is your mic on?

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
Are you just far away from it?

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
I don't do this much.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
There you go.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
Thank you.

20:16.000 --> 20:21.000
That does make me curious.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
When you're in a movie like that

20:23.000 --> 20:26.000
where you're shooting gagoos and everything's like...

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
So then, let's say,

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
Joss Whedon comes up,

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
okay, we did one take,

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
now he's going to give you an adjustment.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
How much...?

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
He actually made up the whole movement.

20:38.000 --> 20:41.000
It was all in his head, so he had various...

20:41.000 --> 20:46.000
Oh, yeah, he wrote it moving, like me.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
At least he told me that,

20:48.000 --> 20:51.000
and he would physically ask me

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
to do different physical things

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
and demonstrate it for me,

20:55.000 --> 20:56.000
and the Russos don't do that.

20:56.000 --> 20:59.000
They don't understand.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
They're like, I don't know what to do with you.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
Why don't you go away

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
and figure it out with your choreographer?

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
And I'm like, okay, great, I love what I do,

21:06.000 --> 21:09.000
but we'll talk about it later.

21:09.000 --> 21:12.000
But anyway, this is so frivolous.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
I wasn't going to go on to ask you,

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
what's it like to wear so much makeup?

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
I was going to eventually...

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
I did invite you on,

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
because we were doing a project together,

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
and so you were one of the first people I saw

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
in the wake of all of this.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
In the wake of every woman in Los Angeles,

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
going through something

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
that I'm not even allowed to pretend I understand,

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
because that's just part of the problem,

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
blah, blah, blah, and that makes me more mad,

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
makes me want to be manly and do things,

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
and that's what the problem is,

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
because we just elected a guy

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
that wants to be manly and do things,

21:45.000 --> 21:48.000
and it's like, I can't man-splain,

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
but the only thing to explain

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
is that I want to man-splain,

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
and not being able to man-splain

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
is making me angry,

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
and my therapist has verified

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
that that is every couple right now

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
that's coming through.

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
It's like, it's a woman with a...

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
as a Star Wars fan,

22:02.000 --> 22:06.000
I would call it a carbon-scored feeling panel.

22:06.000 --> 22:09.000
That was tricked over,

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
let's face it, 180 years

22:11.000 --> 22:15.000
into putting a little fiber optic cable out,

22:15.000 --> 22:18.000
and then it just got sliced off

22:18.000 --> 22:22.000
with this Cronenbergian penis slimy knife,

22:22.000 --> 22:25.000
like, tricked you, got you,

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
and now they're just wandering,

22:27.000 --> 22:30.000
but anyways, what was I talking to you about?

22:30.000 --> 22:33.000
We were talking about,

22:33.000 --> 22:36.000
I mean, I don't know if I represent

22:36.000 --> 22:37.000
a feminine response.

22:37.000 --> 22:38.000
No, not at all, no.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
But, I mean, just because I don't...

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
No, you were like,

22:41.000 --> 22:42.000
I just pulled out my dick and vote,

22:42.000 --> 22:43.000
and I was like, whoa!

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
It's huge, but it blows red,

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
and I can't, it was like...

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
No, no.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
I was actually not in the country,

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
because I did a mail-in vote,

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
and handed it in,

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
because I was so scared to trust the mail service,

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
and I was in Mexico City,

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
and so that was really interesting,

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
and I was talking...

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
How fast are they going to build this thing if it...

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
Well, yeah.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
I mean, I guess the joke is,

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
is now they're like,

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
yeah, let's fucking build a wall,

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
so no one from America can come in.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
That's the only joke to make now,

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
but I had a friend when I was saying,

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
really emotionally on Wednesday morning,

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
I was like,

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
how can there be so many races,

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
and xenophobic people, and sexism,

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
and everyone's so uneducated,

23:25.000 --> 23:28.000
our education system has failed us.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
He just said,

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
you know, I don't...

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
Like my president, I didn't vote for him,

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
but there are a lot of people in my country who did,

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
and a lot of people make $2 an hour,

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
and well, he first told me

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
that I was part of the problem for saying that,

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
and then he said, you know,

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
I don't blame the guy who makes $2 an hour

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
for voting for our president,

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
because he actually bought his vote,

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
and gave him a refrigerator,

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
and I don't think he's stupid, I don't think he's ignorant,

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
and I'm not saying we're in the same situation,

23:56.000 --> 23:57.000
but I...

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
We don't measure things in refrigerators,

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
but they're coming along down there.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
I measure them in delicious Trump steaks.

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
But that is something to think about,

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
like, okay, how am I part of the problem

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
by just naturally assuming that all these people

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
are this, this, this, and this, and then...

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
How are you part of the solution, you mean?

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
Yeah, yeah, sorry, or...

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
You said, how am I part of the problem?

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
Yes, I am part of the problem,

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
because I'm doing this.

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
And because I have a vagina.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
It's full of mystery,

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
and betrayal.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
Just ask the blacks.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
That's what I came here tonight to do,

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
erase lines.

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
Yes, it...

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
How are you...

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
That's what I'm trying to figure out, is like,

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
okay, so I... Yeah, it's like...

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
And there's lines behind lines behind lines,

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
because when I hear that story about Kumeil at the bar,

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
I'm like, oh, bullies.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
I know what a bully is,

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
and then that means I need to do this and this and that.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
I don't know those two guys.

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
I know...

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
I know five things about them,

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
all of which total make them douchebags,

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
and they needed to be dealt with

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
in that moment, the way that they were dealt with,

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
and we would be foolish

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
to not ask ourselves at this point,

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
should we...

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
There's two things to think about for me.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
One is, how do I deal with the anxiety,

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
like, in a healthy way?

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
Mm-hmm.

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
Which Emily Gordon, Kumeil's wife, like,

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
there's been a lot of great things online,

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
and people going like,

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
you're filled with this shit right now.

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
The consensus seems to be,

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
it's a great time to go volunteer

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
for stuff, which sounds like

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
a fucking last thing you want to do.

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
But it's like...

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
I think it's the thing,

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
if I force myself to go to 826LA

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
and see what I can do to help,

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
that somehow that'll lead to some kind of relief

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
in a healthy way.

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
But the other thing is that I can't ignore

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
the things like, aren't we supposed to get ready

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
for some fucking fisticuffs?

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
I ordered a salad tonight

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
at the restaurant, because I got to stop

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
eating Doritos, because there's Nazis.

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
And I would be very

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
foolish to be like,

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
maybe they just need a hug.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
That to me sounds like a great origin story

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
for an Avengers character.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
I actually

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
I don't understand fighting violence

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
with violence, I just have never understood that.

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
So if some...

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
I think kudos to say

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
I'd stand straight up at that person

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
and get him to back down.

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
I think there is a version of that

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
that doesn't have to be

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
violent and confrontational.

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
But you and I have talked a lot

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
about the idea of

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
lines and divides and trying to figure out

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
No one's...people are so scared

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
to say how they felt.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
And it's because the people who have

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
the privilege to be

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
on social media and have a lot of

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
followers, or to be

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
on a podcast, or to be on whatever.

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
They tend to all kind of believe the same

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
things. And we're all just talking

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
to each other.

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
And I think, you know, with algorithms

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
and Facebook, and you just

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
see what you want to see.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
And I don't understand

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
how that's ever going to change anything.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
We were all just talking to ourselves

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
the whole time. Like if you like

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
one side or the other, you're only listening

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
to that one side. So why are you so surprised

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
that there is another side?

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
You just weren't listening to it.

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
Also, why is a parakeet surprised that there's a mirror in its cage?

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
Why are people chanting

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
for Hulk Hogan shocked

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
that someone's into the Iron Sheik

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
at the same event?

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
We are being sold

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
because of the camel clutch.

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
The camel clutch.

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
A devastating move.

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
Another thing that was kind of like

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
a relief was that

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
because I don't like

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
as a celebrity

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
or an edit person who's in movies

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
I don't like the idea

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
of being like, I

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
believe this. So therefore I'm going to change

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
all your opinions because I believe it.

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
And I think that's like a weird egocentric

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
thing and that's kind of what Hollywood

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
did. And

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
what we were talking about when I brought it up the other day

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
you said, no one's going to look

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
at Jay-Z and be like, oh Jay-Z

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
wants Hillary for president.

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
I have so much in common

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
with Jay-Z.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
I'm going to vote for Hillary now.

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
They've got nothing in common.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
I've got 99 problems too.

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
But is it

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
bitch one?

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
It is now.

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
I've got 99 problems

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
and a bitch not being in the White House

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
is one of them.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
He puts out a new

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
version of his.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
Yeah, what were we talking about?

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
The Jay-Z example

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
kind of like blurs lines

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
for me because I get scared in white

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
and like, well again I don't,

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
I can't fucking

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
blank-splain anything to

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
a certain like

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
people.

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
That's going to be the new thing.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
It's going to be the episode title.

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
What were you saying?

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
If I'm working

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
I'm going to take some liberties

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
and create a cartoon character.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
If I'm Joe Welds a lot

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
coming off of my

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
half-closed factory job

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
and going to Pizza Hut because it's the

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
fanciest restaurant in town and it's payday

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
and I'm like eating with a knife and fork

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
because pizza's fancy food for me

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
because I live in Poe Dunkea.

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
I'm taking liberties.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
I'm saying

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
assume the guy that's the least

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
receptive to this message.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
So Joe Welds

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
a lot from Poe Dunkea.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
The TV in the corner

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
as Robert Downey Jr. on it saying

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
look we have to talk. Tomorrow

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
you have a choice to make and the power

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
is in your hands and it doesn't really matter.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
They made a very funny

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
self-effacing meta version

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
of that thing but I'm just saying

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
the bottom line

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
of that message isn't

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
oh look what I'm

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
doing or I'm making you aware of something

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
that everybody knows the elections coming up.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
Everybody that cares about

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
voting because they feel something

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
that's staked for them because they're not

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
hopelessly disenfranchised is going

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
to vote because it's actually about them

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
and they feel that way

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
and so a person

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
saying like look at me

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
you gotta vote

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
and you gotta vote right. If I was

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
the slightest bit inclined

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
to not

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
believe in the elitist

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
liberal

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
king's landing that I'd be like

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
see there we go. I would pull

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
the other lever twice just because

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
it'd be like don't don't and so

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
it's probably doing it's

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
bolstering the base you know somewhere else

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
I don't know what we got on this topic it's stupid

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
the it's more

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
let's bring out Brandon Johnson he'll help us.

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
Oh yeah hit it babes.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
Brandon Johnson

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
the only guy

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000

I'm glad you all made it out thanks for having me Dan

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
it's another thing it seems like we can't

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
enjoy anything anymore right now

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
well not this week don't rush us

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
exactly like I feel like if I'm smiling

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
someone's judging me or if I'm like having

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
a lunch like I can't be enjoying

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
the food I'm eating. I've been forcing

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
myself to express my pissy

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
kind of comments as jokes

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
recognizable as jokes

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
on Twitter and I but then someone

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
will go like I'm just waiting for somebody to go like

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
yo you didn't make that joke about Hillary

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
or whatever their responses that's

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
not either that's funny

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
I don't even want to hear that's not funny

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
don't tweet at me what is he fucking

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
this president almost got me to say retarded

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
Brandon where are you at right now

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
what's uh oh hi Brandon oh man it's

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
awesome it's like if you

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
if you were a Native American

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
and you you looked

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
over and you were like all I noticed

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
was that your mother fuckers wouldn't shooting

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
at me and trying to steal my land no

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
more

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
what is going on out there

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
it looked like white people

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
mad at each other

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
this is the

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
greatest day we're actually

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
because the weird shit is

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
there were no shootings two to

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
three weeks of Native Americans

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
of black people there was a

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
dip there was a dip

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
we started hating a lighter shade of

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
brown that's right

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
so it has been amazing

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
to watch it is like

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
it's like a Super Bowl

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
or a

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
baseball game

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
you know do you really think there

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
would you speculate that

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
that is a symptom of any kind of solidarity

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
like the idea that

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
you never had your dreams crushed

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
let me

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
let me tell you this shit

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
for y'all it's like

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
it's almost like if a black kid was laying

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
in a pool of blood

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
you know

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
and for hours this shit

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
and then a bunch of people videotaped it

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
you were like

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
I'm fucked up over that

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
and then it kept happening and there were like

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
585 in a year

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
your heart would already be broke so this

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
shit is like amazing

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
are you saying that

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
you think like the

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
Chicago PD

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
was less inclined to start shooting

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
people that they knew were black American

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
citizens because

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
now they're starting to defend borders

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
like in shit or? I'm saying I look down

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
and I see

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
upper-matic

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
I see troops on either side

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
fucking each other up over some shit

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
that I'm not really a part of

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
I'm gonna get fucked over either way

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
white people once they come together

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
after this republican

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
that shit

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
I live in Los Feliz

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
and one white people were running up to me like

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
damn this is fucked up and I just want to apologize

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
so I'm like you'll be alright

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
well

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
if you keep dressing up like you're from

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
nation of Islam from 1965

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
you might get

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
grandfathered into a shooting

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
be careful

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
see what I'm saying

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
how comedy can bring us together

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
your mother fuckers ran up on your house

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
in trucks and were like

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
pull your daddy out

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
where I come from

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
where Mexicans come from

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
where Asians come from

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
mother fuckers die during election season

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
people leave town to get the fuck

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
out because it might be a new president

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
mother fucker will get you

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
I don't want to just clear those bars

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
as a society

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
I'd like to avoid getting as low

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
as comparing ourselves to

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
the election where people are getting killed

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
instead of voting

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
but to your point

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
we are pussies

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
we're not pussies and it's great

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
that we're upset we should be upset

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
that was some bullshit that went down

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
but you better get the fuck back up

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
because we live in Whoville you hear me

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
and the Grinch

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
looks at us

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
I want him to hear us singing

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
I don't want that mother fucker

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
I thought

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
I thought it was from Horton

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
here's a who and I was like

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
I know but he reads that one

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
Horton is there

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
Horton needs a who is the apocalypse now

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
of Seuss books it's like

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
all the film students are like master piece

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
master piece fucking watching that shit

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
six hours

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
fireworks and Martin Sheen

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
dancing

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
bonus DVD

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
now the French scenes in it

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
are you trying to make me kill myself

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
alright sorry I got off in a tangent

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
but

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
he made me picture a scene that has nothing to do

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
with what you're saying and I can't

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
my OCD like

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
when I misunderstood you earlier

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
there was a cop

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
on the foot of his bed getting dressed

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
for work and like he had slept

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
through the election results in his

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
and he assumed that Hillary got elected

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
and he was facing his blue

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
laces

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
with the usual

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
tooth gritted

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
resigned numb determination

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
time to go back into the

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
demilitarized zone

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
and fight a war that can't be won

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
and then his wife comes in

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
with some orange juice

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
and some pancakes

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
and she goes like you seem a little glum

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
and he's like yeah another day another dollar

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
and she goes

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
you didn't watch the results last night did you

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
who are you talking about

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
we elected some

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
email ladies

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
no honey

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
we're racist now

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
shut up

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
the whole country

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
against who

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
name them

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
pick a country

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
and then he's like

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
so I don't have to

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
represent racism

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
while trying to do your job of policing the public

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
no it has been

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
taken up by every man

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
woman and child in the country

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
so my job is to serve

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
and protect the racist

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
the racist

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
zippity dude

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
and then he walks past a black

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
kid who is helping his friend move

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
and is holding a TV

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
and that's a crime

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
and he's

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
but on any other day

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
and he goes like

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
need help with that

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
and then he gets it

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
over to the car and he gets in

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
and he goes like thanks officer and he's like

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
no problem just you know trying to be a little

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
more low profile what do you mean in helping my friend move

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
you were helping your friend move

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
you thought I was robbing someone

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
yeah

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
but we're building a wall

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
yeah

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
I'm still racist I'm just in a good mood right now

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
yeah

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
you just became the smallest racist

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
fish to fry I have

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
like racism

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
is my life now

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
it's like it should be it's Christmas

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
I was like I don't know

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
if you watched SNL last night

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
David Chappelle

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
the funniest

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
bit was

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
David Chappelle and Chris Rock

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
they're in a room filled

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
with white people screaming at the television finding out

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
that Hillary was losing

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
and they're like oh my god

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
I can't believe there's so many

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
racists in this country and they're just like

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
yeah what do you mean like

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
you just figured

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
that out because of this election

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
there was all this sexual assault

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
in the comedy community

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
and comedians are clowns

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
they're clowns that's what we do

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
when you hear that they're like

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
raping clowns you should probably

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
perk your fucking ears up

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
when you hear that there's shit going down

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
you should probably should have known because

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
we're living in what so many other people

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
saw coming up

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
if you were down on the ground if you're fucking suffering

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
if you're a woman if you're handicapped

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
you're gay if you're black in the United States

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
you knew what the fuck was about to go down

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
I'm not surprised so many homophobic handicapped

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
people right now are just like

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
fucking keep it up man

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
keep putting me on that list

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
and because we're not surprised

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
we're not tripped out about the shit

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
so don't you be tripped out about the shit

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
just fucking war on

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
that's what people don't talk about in the news media as much as they ought to

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
is how homophobic most handicapped people are

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
it's not a joke it's a real fucking thing

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
it's not a popular topic it won't get you

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
you know winning a popularity contest

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
but it might get you elected

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
if you wait until

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
there's a huge population of homophobic

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
handicapped people and

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
then one side is completely ignored them

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
and then you go we're going to build a big

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
ramp dick proof wall

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
we're going to build a giant ramp

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
that gets you to all the pussy

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
and keeps all the dick underneath it

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
that's what Pence is planning on doing

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
if we impeach Trump by the way

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
I know well that's the other thing

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
I was like no no we can't

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
impeach Trump we need him in there

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
we do

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
we need this thing to

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
absolutely become a sinking ship

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
and watch the whole thing

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
consume itself

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
because if he gets

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
busted for one of his 90

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
rape trials that are coming up

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
the guy that looks like Eisenhower

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
who hates gay people more than anybody goes into office

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
and then the shit's for real then

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
well so they think about the irony of that

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
remember 8 years ago

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
like I said at the top of the show I truly am

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
43 years old grew up in the 70s I really truly believed

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
we didn't have it wouldn't have happened

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
I was like holy shit I was a total

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
surprise to me that we

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
Obama got elected and so my first

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
thought was oh shit a lot

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
of white liberals are like is he

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
going to get assassinated

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
and then the response to that would always be

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
like oh with a chuckle

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
oh god no not president Biden

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
so think about the irony of the fact

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
that was it

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
we're chuckling about that

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
and then now Trump gets elected

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
again your first thought because you didn't

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
see it coming is he going to get assassinated

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
and everybody goes no no no

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
not president

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
fucking Pence

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
that guy knows exactly what to do

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
like like like

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
we got it's going to take

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
two years for Trump to find the

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
phone

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
like there's already articles

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
about him did you see the thing about

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
he now wants to do things a little different

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
he doesn't want to spend very much time

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
in the White House

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
it's almost adorable

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
it starts to make you think like what if he did

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
yeah but he's going to leave Rudy Giuliani and

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
like fucking

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
they know what to do

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
you know Newt Gingrich he invented

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
this whole fucking mess he's like we just call

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
it not what it really is and then

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
we don't have to talk on the same reality as everybody

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
else and that's like where we're at is

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
and his name is Newt Plainsite

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
Newt Draconis

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
from the not at all lizard people

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
why

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
I don't think global warming is a

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
problem

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
uh just

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
I mean sometimes you need a little son

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
sometimes you need a fucking load of

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
flies

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
Giuliani is the only person that claps louder

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
when he hears 9-11 than our audience

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
hahahaha

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
that guy is

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
straight up

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
every

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
clinician I've texted

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
because I've done this before

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
I've seen people on a monitor and I've

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
texted doctors that were in the area

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
and said is he sundowning? yes

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
like that was

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
what is sundowning? I don't know what that phrase means

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
the sundowning is like

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
people suffering from

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
dementia, Alzheimer's

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
there's a phenomena where they

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
around the

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
sundown hours

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
that's called moon upping

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
sometimes to euphoria, sometimes to

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
super anger

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
often just confusion and stuff, agitation

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
probably very agitating

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
to like yeah

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
Giuliani is going through a weird metamorphosis

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
where he's looking more like one of those fishes

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
that you only see in the very deep deep ocean

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
where the teeth are doing a whole

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
weird thing and the day

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
he's trumps flavor-flav

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
like he was like

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
hahahaha

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
like

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
no one's getting a guillotine when he

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
talks because

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
he's not running for anything

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
and trumps one and he's like bring out the legion

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
of doom

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
and it was just like this fucking

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
like it was like the end

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
of michael douglas' the game

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
they're doing like

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
i know michael douglas didn't produce the film

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
but i just mean the michael douglas

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
movie the game when it's like at the end

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
of the party it's like oh you were there and you were there

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
the secretary of transportation

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
chris christie

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
stepped on my joke with a kiss

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
i connected the dots of transportation

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
and chris christie i bet nobody

46:07.000 --> 46:11.000
thought of that

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
what's next

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
secretary of garlic

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
count dracula

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
he'd hate it

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
he'd get rid of it

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
secretary of garlic

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
yeah bad things are bad

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
but yeah this is all a mishmash

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
it was a big casserole

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
it got this political thing

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
like the voting and the thing

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
it's important

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
i'm not going to be jaded about that anymore

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
i still maintain

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
stop yelling at people on twitter about how they voted for

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
some bat person

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
or whatever

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
her name's jill stein and you don't have to be mean about it

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
i said 300 million people in this country

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
and like a fraction of them vote

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
every four years and every

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
every time we do this ritual

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
where when it's a squeaker

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
like we compare the numbers

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
and then we look

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
oh when you voted for harambe

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
and wasn't on anyone's side

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
we should be impressed

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
that they wanted to express themselves

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
and be counted

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
we remember every four years how fucked up the electoral colleges

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
but we're never mad about that

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
for the three and

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
.9 years in between

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
i want to change it change it just not right after

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
it worked and had a thing

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
and we can't change it now especially with the republican

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
house and senate

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
i want to know who are the 49 million people

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
that didn't vote

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
we should be concerned with those people

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
those are the real because

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
we stood by evil triumph

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
or they have their own

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
creepy weird ass party that could take over

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
both of our fucking parties

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
we gotta find out who had it so

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
good that they didn't care

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
was gonna be bad or who had it

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
so bad they didn't care

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
was gonna be good

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
you know who i blame

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
i feel like

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
the turnout among babies was very low

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
yeah

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
where's the baby folk

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
you were gonna say something

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
i don't remember

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
i get nervous

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
let's see if i had something to say

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
right now attacking any group

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
of anything isn't actually

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
it happens

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
headline on it which is like

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
well there's this observational humor to be made

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
you see the statistics that as a white person

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
you're like you're fucking

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
i was watching

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
the numbers and looking at the statistics

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
at one point i swear to god

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
there was a thought briefly

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
you know how the

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
thoughts are just going and the

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
embers that come out of the campfire

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
they mostly just disappear when they're

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
two inches from the fire and then others cause

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
huge fires

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
for one moment there was a little

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
spark in my head when i saw the number

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
of immigrants that weren't voting

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
i was like you fuckers now i want a wall

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
you're ruining the election

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
i should be protected from you

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
it would help if there was a day off

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
that's the big deal

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
nobody knows it but if you

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
have a shitty job your boss does not let

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
you go vote

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
and you don't get enough time to vote

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
what do we get in california an hour

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
sometimes you need yeah that's

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
i guess i haven't been told that for my employer

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
cause they told me an hour

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
i told you not to vote

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
i think they should move

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
today we all vote to christmas eve

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
it's obviously insane that it's not

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
a holiday that makes no

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
fucking sense at all

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
it's very clear that we

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
don't want everyone to vote

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
we don't want it to be a thing

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
he repealed the voting rights act

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
it was like a big part of the civil rights movement

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
and we got rid of it

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
in the swing states where uh trump won

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
now it's back

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
i fixed it

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
what the hell happened

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
a guy in a tank chop just made a weird sound

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
and walked away

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
was that one of the babes

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
statistically speaking

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
30% of los angeles

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
voted for trump

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
i think it was the base player of the babes

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
hey babes

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
i tweeted about it

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
i went the day after the

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
wednesday morning i went and got a coffee

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
and a bunch of glum

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
hipsters in silver lake were all looking

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
bummed out while they were ordering $11,000

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
quiches and croissants

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
just to interject you officially

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
no longer know that those guys aren't nazis

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
because two of them poked kumail

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
in the chest

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
it happened in silver lake

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
oh my god it happened in silver lake

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
it happened in silver lake

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
where all the liberals go

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
just when you thought it was

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
safe to have artisanal yogurts

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
i'm not i'm tired

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
of letting you shame me brandon

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
liberals are having a hard time right now

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
so everybody's like

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
wait until you have to pick up your kids

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
from the morgue

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
my kids

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
can't you just leave them

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
why do you have to pick them up can't you just leave them there

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
i'm not gonna know

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
liberals kids are pre morgue

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
we don't reproduce we

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
they get in the way of our wine tastings

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
but anyway

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
there was glum people and a gal

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
like a young kind of hipster

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
barista chick behind the counter

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
kind of smiled like you know

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
a kind of a rise

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
well on the bright side

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
at least music's gonna get good again

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
but then i treated that

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
and someone pointed out quite rightly

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
i don't really listen to new music

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
and certainly i don't listen to enough hip-hop

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
hip-hop has already been going through

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
kind of like a golden age

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
some people think

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
i'll explain it

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
uh

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
hey dan

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
why don't you field this one for us

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
you've had enough power sir

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
just want to go back to the cave

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
wait this shit out

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
so there's a little too much

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
autotune but there's a lot of passion

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
go ahead brandon what's your take

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
try to be more informed than that

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
because some of us

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
jerk off to the hip-hop pandora channel

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
what

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
really

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
that's really not racist of you

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
that's so good

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
for those of you listening at home right now

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
you can download dan's entire rant on that

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
with the

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
harmontown.com

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
so

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
anyways

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
well

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
i wasn't really waiting for your take on hip-hop

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
having transformed

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
brandon and i are more

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
we bond when we get together

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
about the lost days

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
of the true golden age of hip-hop

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
uh the early years

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
when you can rap about peas and carrots

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
right and rap was very very slow

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
when it was slow and focused on peas and carrots

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
yeah

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
babes can you

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
can you guys lay down a beat or no is that outside

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
of your bailiwick

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
we're kind of a base heavy

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
like kind of r&b

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
is that about the freestyle?

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
yeah let me see what we got

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
i mean in these sad political times

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
sometimes music and then poetry

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
maybe you do

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
oh nice

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
oh yeah

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
well have you ever had

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
a sandwich on some bread

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
and realized you were in bed

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
and the crumbs go down

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
to superman's house

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
and you have to fight a super mouse

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
old school

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
have you

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
ever enjoyed a bowl of soup

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
and the next thing you know

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
your body starts to poop

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
you get diarrhea from this damn dish

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
and throwing up that soup is your wish

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
ha ha ha ha ha

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
to the dream

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
that we could have

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
if we only believed

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
in

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
sav

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
everyone loves sav

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
i gave sav my art to graph

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
put that ointment on

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
of a rap

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
you didn't know what to say

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
so the end of the rapping line

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
you just decided to lay it down a little

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

raganomics made

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
rap better

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
raganomics made rap better

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
and also made us wear sweaters

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
a lot at zippers

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
and we had straps and women were

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
doing a lot of aerobics

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

57:27.720 --> 57:27.720
sorry have you ever

57:27.720 --> 57:29.720
i'm sorry

57:29.720 --> 57:31.720
no i was just

57:31.720 --> 57:33.720
wondering have you ever done a rap

57:33.720 --> 57:35.720
so much

57:35.720 --> 57:37.720
i was just asking a question

57:37.720 --> 57:39.720
i wasn't starting it

57:39.720 --> 57:41.720
well i did a rap and i'm right over

57:42.020 --> 57:44.020
My question was um

57:44.400 --> 57:45.680
What's this?

57:45.680 --> 57:49.340
Have you ever done a rap that sounded like Johnny Cash big Lee?

57:50.340 --> 57:56.160
Like the Talks section of the Johnny Cash album instead of a real rap song. Have you ever done that?

57:56.160 --> 57:58.280
I bought it one piece at a time

57:59.400 --> 58:01.400
Didn't cost me a dime

58:04.980 --> 58:06.980
Pre-sampling law rap

58:06.980 --> 58:09.660
Riding one piece at a time. Yeah

58:09.660 --> 58:11.660
There's one piece of the tongue.

58:11.660 --> 58:12.660
One piece of the tongue.

58:12.660 --> 58:14.660
Johnny Cash is doing the Rihanna hook on this one.

58:14.660 --> 58:15.660
Yeah.

58:15.660 --> 58:16.660
No.

58:16.660 --> 58:17.660
We know.

58:17.660 --> 58:18.660
We got it.

58:18.660 --> 58:19.660
We knew it.

58:19.660 --> 58:20.660
One piece at a time.

58:20.660 --> 58:23.660
It tells the name of this rhyme.

58:23.660 --> 58:26.660
You take one piece and put it on another time.

58:26.660 --> 58:27.660
And then you put the time together.

58:27.660 --> 58:29.660
And you have multiple rhymes.

58:29.660 --> 58:32.660
They're like amino acids that form a gene.

58:32.660 --> 58:35.660
That makes biology work, if you know what I mean.

58:35.660 --> 58:38.660
Even though I pronounce it weird.

58:38.660 --> 58:40.660
Biology.

58:40.660 --> 58:42.660
Ha ha ha ha.

58:42.660 --> 58:45.660
I started trying to rap too fast.

58:45.660 --> 58:47.660
And I wanted to rap in the past.

58:47.660 --> 58:50.660
So I could rap real slow and make it last.

58:50.660 --> 58:55.660
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

58:55.660 --> 58:57.660
I walk the line.

58:57.660 --> 59:00.660
You know you walk the line.

59:00.660 --> 59:01.660
I'll ring a fire.

59:01.660 --> 59:03.660
I'll ring a fire.

59:03.660 --> 59:04.660
Put your wrap to cease.

59:04.660 --> 59:06.660
Have your body on your knees.

59:06.660 --> 59:09.660
I'm gonna have your motherfuckers on my balls like thickin' fleas, no

59:09.660 --> 59:12.660
Even though we was rappin' slow, this is what I really do

59:12.660 --> 59:14.660
Hit these motherfuckers, make it so I spit a bull

59:14.660 --> 59:17.660
We gon' be alright, don't worry about election

59:17.660 --> 59:20.660
Think about it, I'm rockin', use erection

59:20.660 --> 59:24.660
I walked into a burnin' ring of fire

59:24.660 --> 59:30.660
Down, down, down, the flames went high

59:30.660 --> 59:33.660
But not to be outdone, I'm gonna rap super fast too

59:33.660 --> 59:38.660
And I've always rapped this fast, and I'm rubber

59:38.660 --> 59:41.660
And you're glue, and I see a nation, it's disintegration

59:41.660 --> 59:45.660
But I'm not Haitian, so I don't have an HIV crustacean

59:45.660 --> 59:48.660
Oh, ah, ah, ah, ah

59:48.660 --> 59:51.660
Walk it back, keep it flowin'

59:51.660 --> 59:53.660
I'm rappin' fast, rappin' fast

59:53.660 --> 59:56.660
And I'm growin' as a person and a Samoan

59:56.660 --> 59:58.660
What's with those people? Why are they so big?

59:58.660 --> 01:00:00.660
I'm sorry, god damn it

01:00:00.660 --> 01:00:03.660
Alright, just a white brain, rap it

01:00:03.660 --> 01:00:06.660
Just a white brain, rap it, don't rap too fast with a white brain

01:00:06.660 --> 01:00:07.660
You're old

01:00:07.660 --> 01:00:11.660
Have you ever noticed the Japanese are taking all these pictures?

01:00:11.660 --> 01:00:12.660
God damn it

01:00:12.660 --> 01:00:13.660
Jesus

01:00:13.660 --> 01:00:17.660
Godzilla, Godzilla, Godzilla, it's a drum filler

01:00:17.660 --> 01:00:20.660
Drum filler, Godzilla, drum filler

01:00:20.660 --> 01:00:24.660
I got a drum filler, a Godzilla, and a Johnny Cash

01:00:24.660 --> 01:00:27.660
Lay it on the line, but the lines are gone

01:00:27.660 --> 01:00:32.660
One piece at a time, and it didn't cost me a dime

01:00:32.660 --> 01:00:33.660
Yeah

01:00:33.660 --> 01:00:35.660
You know it's me when I come to your town

01:00:35.660 --> 01:00:36.660
Black women

01:00:36.660 --> 01:00:38.660
Love swimming

01:00:38.660 --> 01:00:42.660
I hurt myself today

01:00:42.660 --> 01:00:45.660
He hurt himself today

01:00:45.660 --> 01:00:47.660
He hurt himself today

01:00:47.660 --> 01:00:49.660
And if you listen closely, you heard me say

01:00:49.660 --> 01:00:54.660
Oh, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha

01:00:54.660 --> 01:00:57.660
I try to laugh like I sound like I'm having fun

01:00:57.660 --> 01:01:02.660
But I'm really sad because Donald Trump won, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha

01:01:02.660 --> 01:01:04.660
It's a fake laugh

01:01:04.660 --> 01:01:13.660
Everyone in a wheelchair hates gay people today

01:01:13.660 --> 01:01:20.660
How does it feel wheelchair people to be boxed in and told you're homophobic

01:01:20.660 --> 01:01:23.660
with no power to control it?

01:01:23.660 --> 01:01:28.660
Yo, if you have wheels on your chair, and you got a heart, then you're still on the air

01:01:28.660 --> 01:01:30.660
with me up in heaven

01:01:30.660 --> 01:01:32.660
Because you're dead

01:01:32.660 --> 01:01:38.660
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha

01:01:38.660 --> 01:01:41.660
Well I shot a man in Reno

01:01:41.660 --> 01:01:45.660
Just to watch him die

01:01:45.660 --> 01:01:48.660
River boat, river boat, take me down

01:01:48.660 --> 01:01:51.660
See, I would do it for six hours they knew to end it

01:01:51.660 --> 01:01:53.660
Woo!

01:02:00.660 --> 01:02:02.660
Babes, that was awesome!

01:02:04.660 --> 01:02:06.660
Fuckin' wow!

01:02:12.660 --> 01:02:17.660
What the listeners don't know is that Spencer and Lizzie were doing a dance the entire time doing that.

01:02:17.660 --> 01:02:22.660
We could make an album of Harmontown songs and sell it as an album.

01:02:22.660 --> 01:02:26.660
Actually, actually I recorded Ha Ha Ha with somebody already.

01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:31.660
So we'd have to go through legal, but I'm sure Kesha would be down.

01:02:33.660 --> 01:02:38.660
Two chains, a shirt, there were like 14 people in the booth, so...

01:02:40.660 --> 01:02:44.660
Yeah Brandon, well you couldn't see why you were doing the double time fast rap.

01:02:44.660 --> 01:02:47.660
Is that Dan was like, you piece of shit.

01:02:47.660 --> 01:02:49.660
How dare you.

01:02:49.660 --> 01:02:52.660
You said you would rap slow with me tonight.

01:02:52.660 --> 01:02:58.660
I said come on my show and rap like we used to in the 80s.

01:02:58.660 --> 01:03:03.660
Before it got hurtful and angry and for talented people.

01:03:05.660 --> 01:03:10.660
Back when it was just bell pottos and kick lines and peas and gears.

01:03:10.660 --> 01:03:15.660
I'm pretty sure we now owe Rick Rubin lots of royalties on what I just did.

01:03:15.660 --> 01:03:19.660
And everybody from that generation of hip hop and apology, I didn't mean you weren't talented.

01:03:19.660 --> 01:03:21.660
That's ridiculous, I didn't mean that.

01:03:21.660 --> 01:03:23.660
I meant I'm not talented enough to rap fast.

01:03:23.660 --> 01:03:26.660
We have the Sugar Hill gang coming on next week, so you can apologize.

01:03:26.660 --> 01:03:29.660
We don't really like what you just said.

01:03:31.660 --> 01:03:34.660
We're doing the best we can!

01:03:34.660 --> 01:03:40.660
Now don't push me, because I'm close to the air.

01:03:44.660 --> 01:03:52.660
That's how slow hip hop moved is that the whole refrain was about them getting close to...

01:03:52.660 --> 01:04:01.660
Yeah, but then the verses would be about Superman hands you your car keys and you get into your car.

01:04:01.660 --> 01:04:06.660
And you start the ignition and press the gas pedal and you start to go far.

01:04:06.660 --> 01:04:11.660
But you haven't gone far yet, you still check your mirrors and you look at your blind spot.

01:04:11.660 --> 01:04:16.660
And you start to pull out but you've never been good at parallel parking.

01:04:16.660 --> 01:04:23.660
There was a point in early hip hop where Debbie Harry from Blondie was one of the three best rappers in the world.

01:04:23.660 --> 01:04:29.660
I mean she was beautiful though, so of course she was allowed to rap.

01:04:29.660 --> 01:04:38.660
It's really weird when you listen to that Blondie song and you're listening to her doing that.

01:04:38.660 --> 01:04:47.660
You're like, oh that's like a YouTube kid taking a butter container and tapping it and turning it around while they do it.

01:04:47.660 --> 01:04:54.660
It's like, oh it's an experimental style, like that's Blondie trying her hand at this thing from the streets.

01:04:54.660 --> 01:04:59.660
Like, no, my name's Blondie, I'm here to say, I don't know, it's kind of funny.

01:04:59.660 --> 01:05:01.660
Because she's doing the same rap.

01:05:01.660 --> 01:05:03.660
But she had Fab Five Freddie with her, right?

01:05:03.660 --> 01:05:05.660
I mean it worked, that song does fucking work.

01:05:05.660 --> 01:05:11.660
She was in New York at the time and we don't know, Blondie probably could have been down.

01:05:11.660 --> 01:05:12.660
She was Titus Fuck.

01:05:12.660 --> 01:05:16.660
Okay, we have Blondie's child is here tonight.

01:05:16.660 --> 01:05:23.660
His rap name is Titus Fuck, so nice shout out to yourself Titus Fuck.

01:05:23.660 --> 01:05:24.660
Titus Fuck.

01:05:24.660 --> 01:05:29.660
I thought it was just complaining as her son that she was, yeah.

01:05:29.660 --> 01:05:33.660
Yeah, 17 hour labor.

01:05:33.660 --> 01:05:36.660
It's not on my end.

01:05:36.660 --> 01:05:39.660
She's not ready to go.

01:05:39.660 --> 01:05:48.660
Jesus Christ.

01:05:48.660 --> 01:05:51.660
So, oh, me? Am I in charge?

01:05:51.660 --> 01:05:56.660
Well, have you noticed Skittles coming out in a lot of flavors?

01:05:56.660 --> 01:06:00.660
No.

01:06:00.660 --> 01:06:04.660
I think that little piece of music, and I'm only half joking,

01:06:04.660 --> 01:06:10.660
obviously I'm making a joke, but that moment where we all laughed and clapped about doing that thing,

01:06:10.660 --> 01:06:12.660
did we do it because we're sad?

01:06:12.660 --> 01:06:13.660
Yes.

01:06:13.660 --> 01:06:14.660
And did it make us feel a lot better?

01:06:14.660 --> 01:06:15.660
Absolutely.

01:06:15.660 --> 01:06:20.660
I think that little song we did softens my experience of the last week.

01:06:20.660 --> 01:06:24.660
Well, actually, that reminds me, let's talk about the thing that was the,

01:06:24.660 --> 01:06:26.660
oh, at least music will be better.

01:06:26.660 --> 01:06:29.660
At least, of course, we've all heard that about comedy.

01:06:29.660 --> 01:06:32.660
Oh, remember John Stuart during the Bush administration and all that stuff?

01:06:32.660 --> 01:06:33.660
Let's talk about that for a second.

01:06:33.660 --> 01:06:37.660
Like, does that, I mean, like, are we just turning that on like a faucet?

01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:39.660
Because for me, it feels deeper.

01:06:39.660 --> 01:06:44.660
Like, back then, I didn't, I knew that we were in a war with Iraq that I didn't believe in

01:06:44.660 --> 01:06:46.660
and that shit was being told to me.

01:06:46.660 --> 01:06:51.660
But I was also like, not into Al Gore, I didn't think he was robbed and I didn't care.

01:06:51.660 --> 01:06:54.660
Like, I was like, I thought all that shit was for chumps.

01:06:54.660 --> 01:06:56.660
Is that just a part of being young?

01:06:56.660 --> 01:06:59.660
Like, like where you're like, fuck this whole system.

01:06:59.660 --> 01:07:04.660
Yeah, you don't give a shit about shit until you own a house and you're like, I'm paying taxes on this.

01:07:04.660 --> 01:07:07.660
So I want those motherfuckers not to park right there.

01:07:07.660 --> 01:07:10.660
So I want to pass a law to get those motherfuckers not to park right there.

01:07:10.660 --> 01:07:12.660
And that's just part of getting older.

01:07:12.660 --> 01:07:13.660
I think that's a huge part of it.

01:07:13.660 --> 01:07:14.660
You don't know.

01:07:14.660 --> 01:07:15.660
That's a huge part of the middle class.

01:07:15.660 --> 01:07:22.660
I think if you go from lower middle class to middle class, like you become Republican with every fucking pebble in that path.

01:07:22.660 --> 01:07:29.660
I think in LA, we have a distorted vision of it because you can shoot up from lower middle class to the equivalent of

01:07:29.660 --> 01:07:34.660
upper class and the whole time retain your, you're like, I'll give my gardeners a bonus.

01:07:34.660 --> 01:07:38.660
But there's a democratic version of don't park in front of my house.

01:07:38.660 --> 01:07:42.660
Maybe it's a cigarette tax or it's something else.

01:07:42.660 --> 01:07:46.660
Everybody, it's really, this is what we saw is like, we didn't know enough about each other.

01:07:46.660 --> 01:07:47.660
We don't know enough about each other.

01:07:47.660 --> 01:07:52.660
So if we had known more about each other, we might have respected rights of other people a little bit more.

01:07:52.660 --> 01:07:56.660
And I think that part of it is age because when you're a kid, of course, you don't know shit.

01:07:56.660 --> 01:08:02.660
But we kind of have to look at ourselves and say, we should have checked in on those people once they started closing those factories.

01:08:02.660 --> 01:08:08.660
It doesn't mean that we owe them anything, but we might have wanted to check on American a little bit more.

01:08:08.660 --> 01:08:13.660
That's like, that's a fantastic way of weaving those cones because I want to really respect the people.

01:08:13.660 --> 01:08:14.660
I think Spencer's one of them.

01:08:14.660 --> 01:08:20.660
And I think I've been really, I've never expressed it to Spencer, but it's like, Spencer's a relatively young guy.

01:08:20.660 --> 01:08:24.660
And it's like, this is a big election and Spencer's like, I watch what he retweets and stuff.

01:08:24.660 --> 01:08:26.660
And I'm like, Spencer's on point.

01:08:26.660 --> 01:08:28.660
And he's like fucking mad.

01:08:28.660 --> 01:08:30.660
Like, like he's not, he's sick and tired.

01:08:30.660 --> 01:08:32.660
Is it correct me if I'm wrong?

01:08:32.660 --> 01:08:41.660
You're sick and tired of the philosophy of like, oh God, see guys, like we shouldn't have ignored them.

01:08:41.660 --> 01:08:45.660
You know, they have needs to don't forget to tolerate the intolerable.

01:08:45.660 --> 01:08:49.660
Or I'm sorry, don't forget to don't forget tolerance for the intolerant.

01:08:49.660 --> 01:08:50.660
You're a little sick of that.

01:08:50.660 --> 01:08:54.660
Like, well, it's, I mean, we, we've had polls.

01:08:54.660 --> 01:08:56.660
We did polls before this election.

01:08:56.660 --> 01:09:03.660
Half of respondents in these polls, half of Trump supporters were like black people are more lazy and more violent than white people.

01:09:03.660 --> 01:09:06.660
A third of Clinton supporters thought that.

01:09:06.660 --> 01:09:10.660
So it's just like, if you ask what their beliefs are, their beliefs are racist.

01:09:10.660 --> 01:09:14.660
And they believe in people who they think can help, but they're not going to help.

01:09:14.660 --> 01:09:15.660
They're not going to help them.

01:09:15.660 --> 01:09:18.660
They're only going to help them if they think that, you know, racism.

01:09:18.660 --> 01:09:24.660
Do you think that the blacks are the black thing about being lazy comes from the old slow rapping back from the 80s?

01:09:24.660 --> 01:09:29.660
It certainly isn't how we met each other.

01:09:29.660 --> 01:09:32.660
I can't even be bothered to rap fast.

01:09:36.660 --> 01:09:37.660
So high.

01:09:40.660 --> 01:09:48.660
I just, I think it's part, it's all, everyone's, you know, you kind of touch on it sometimes, but it's like the word intersectionality gets at that.

01:09:48.660 --> 01:09:54.660
That there's this overarching oppressive system that tells white people that black people are taking their jobs and are causing them problems.

01:09:54.660 --> 01:09:57.660
It tells men that women are, you know, not serious.

01:09:57.660 --> 01:10:01.660
It tells the poor or rich people that poor people are to be feared.

01:10:01.660 --> 01:10:09.660
And it keeps us all complicit in kind of ignoring inequality that happens and ignoring that it's real and ignoring that it's dangerous.

01:10:09.660 --> 01:10:13.660
And that apathy is why half of the eligible voters stayed home.

01:10:13.660 --> 01:10:16.660
I mean, I think if they were more open to the real plight of people,

01:10:16.660 --> 01:10:18.660
they would say, we can't elect Hitler.

01:10:18.660 --> 01:10:19.660
We have to get out there.

01:10:19.660 --> 01:10:22.660
And I think we should have, you know, activated those people.

01:10:22.660 --> 01:10:23.660
But we're still going to have to talk.

01:10:23.660 --> 01:10:26.660
Yeah. No, we can't, because we can't just say, we can't just say, no, you're racist.

01:10:26.660 --> 01:10:34.660
We have to say, you're not racist, but the way you act and the way you make decisions and policy choices is playing into the system that affects us all.

01:10:34.660 --> 01:10:36.660
And it affects you and it makes it so you can't get what you want.

01:10:36.660 --> 01:10:38.660
And it makes it so I can't get what I want.

01:10:38.660 --> 01:10:39.660
And it kills people.

01:10:39.660 --> 01:10:44.660
Right. So I think when you're in a drive through, this is unrelated.

01:10:44.660 --> 01:10:46.660
I'm just so hungry.

01:10:46.660 --> 01:11:02.660
I think when you're in a drive through, like you're the position that you've been placed in before you start communicating with the other person has a huge impact on every aspect that it's like, oh, the person on the other side of the drive through speaker,

01:11:02.660 --> 01:11:05.660
they're speaking the same language as me.

01:11:05.660 --> 01:11:07.660
They everything we're all in the same business.

01:11:07.660 --> 01:11:08.660
It's McDonald's.

01:11:08.660 --> 01:11:17.660
We all know one person wants a burger and how much it should cost and yet so much breakdown because of the position you've been placed in and the filter you're being placed in the other side of it.

01:11:17.660 --> 01:11:19.660
So like, I don't know how to do this.

01:11:19.660 --> 01:11:30.660
I don't know what the practical aspect of this is, but I know that we're, I know that we can't wait for 300 million people to stop being fucking morons because the average IQ is 100.

01:11:30.660 --> 01:11:41.660
And if we don't start, if we don't start being comfortable with the idea that most of the people you meet, most of the people you love, most of the people that if you're in this city, you hope will one day worship you.

01:11:41.660 --> 01:11:44.660
Like, like, they're dumb.

01:11:44.660 --> 01:11:47.660
They're dumb as a turd compared to.

01:11:47.660 --> 01:11:50.660
Dan Harmon calls his fans dumb.

01:11:50.660 --> 01:11:56.660
Like, like, like, like, but, but we're all smarter than termites.

01:11:56.660 --> 01:11:58.660
Giraffes, baboons, rocks.

01:11:58.660 --> 01:12:01.660
If you lay off giraffes for one episode, man.

01:12:01.660 --> 01:12:04.660
I'm not going to let them off the hook just because of this election.

01:12:04.660 --> 01:12:07.660
Like, they didn't come any closer to respect in my mind.

01:12:07.660 --> 01:12:18.660
When you find yourself talking to a person and you, you start to hear them like, bubble up, or you start to feel yourself bubbling up.

01:12:18.660 --> 01:12:22.660
Like, can you identify the speaker between you?

01:12:22.660 --> 01:12:25.660
Can you identify that you're at this drive through?

01:12:25.660 --> 01:12:35.660
Can you, because in real life, getting out of your car accelerated makes it a horrible TMZ clip of like, oh, this person wanted this McNuggets so bad.

01:12:35.660 --> 01:12:37.660
But, but we're not true.

01:12:37.660 --> 01:12:38.660
There's no McNuggets.

01:12:38.660 --> 01:12:40.660
Stop beating that metaphor.

01:12:40.660 --> 01:12:54.660
When you are talking to a person over a wall and you feel like, like there is something between you that can't change instead of focusing on the wall or even trying to talk over it.

01:12:54.660 --> 01:12:59.660
Is there a position that both people can take relative to what you're trying to do?

01:12:59.660 --> 01:13:05.660
Because what if both, what if those people talking over the wall are talking about something over there?

01:13:05.660 --> 01:13:14.660
Like a giant Anthony Hopkins created windmill machine that's going to create a canyon through the episode you're missing tonight.

01:13:14.660 --> 01:13:19.660
Like, what if you're both fucking robots?

01:13:19.660 --> 01:13:26.660
Like, you should both face the problem and you don't have to get over your differences.

01:13:26.660 --> 01:13:31.660
Because that person, the differences might be that that person's fucking racist.

01:13:31.660 --> 01:13:35.660
And that when they look at you, they think that you're a worthless person.

01:13:35.660 --> 01:13:43.660
And that goes back again to like, I think the ladies learned this time around and Brandon's point is like, yeah, welcome to the fucking party.

01:13:43.660 --> 01:13:50.660
Which is like, the music is amazing. You're going to love the music.

01:13:50.660 --> 01:13:57.660
A lot of people got a big fat taste of holy shit for real.

01:13:57.660 --> 01:13:59.660
Not in a Facebook policeable way.

01:13:59.660 --> 01:14:03.660
Not in a, are you being a little by my my way?

01:14:03.660 --> 01:14:06.660
Not in any kind of like, Kelly doesn't like you way.

01:14:06.660 --> 01:14:08.660
Not in a, I'm not hanging out with him way.

01:14:08.660 --> 01:14:14.660
Not in any way that's defeatable by any of that shit in a very real way.

01:14:14.660 --> 01:14:20.660
Someone you might be talking to might be fucking just like looking at you and thinking, that's a vagina.

01:14:20.660 --> 01:14:23.660
That's a black person. That's a white person.

01:14:23.660 --> 01:14:26.660
That's a union person in my case.

01:14:26.660 --> 01:14:27.660
Talk to union people.

01:14:27.660 --> 01:14:28.660
Yeah.

01:14:28.660 --> 01:14:30.660
That is a space person.

01:14:30.660 --> 01:14:32.660
God damn it, his props are electric.

01:14:32.660 --> 01:14:35.660
They all have goatees.

01:14:35.660 --> 01:14:44.660
The wall may be absolutely vile and may need to come down and maybe a huge part of a huge problem.

01:14:44.660 --> 01:14:54.660
But like, how will you ever, like, yeah, that's the big question is like, can we somehow concretize the practice of, oh, there's a wall.

01:14:54.660 --> 01:15:04.660
Okay. Well, let's be better than two ants with a difference between each other and like do this ritual where we rotate 90 degrees.

01:15:04.660 --> 01:15:06.660
And we don't, we'll get back to that wall.

01:15:06.660 --> 01:15:09.660
That wall is fucking even more visible this way.

01:15:09.660 --> 01:15:10.660
It's right there.

01:15:10.660 --> 01:15:12.660
We can even see how long it is and where it came from.

01:15:12.660 --> 01:15:14.660
I'm fucking nailing it now.

01:15:14.660 --> 01:15:24.660
What it connects to all the other walls and stuff, but like the most important thing being like, oh, are we controlling ourselves or are we letting these walls?

01:15:24.660 --> 01:15:26.660
Because who put them there?

01:15:26.660 --> 01:15:29.660
But yeah, that's what you have to, you have to reveal that stuff to people.

01:15:29.660 --> 01:15:39.660
And I think there's this gap, this disconnect because whenever I'm coming from a place, it's, it's from trying to help people and it's not always coming through.

01:15:39.660 --> 01:15:50.660
But it's like, but my understanding that I don't say is that you're, you're focusing on issues of race is distracting you from the real problems that are affecting us all.

01:15:50.660 --> 01:16:01.660
And as long as people ignore that, ignore that disconnect, we're not going to be on the same page, but we have to say like, no, your problems are valid and they're real.

01:16:01.660 --> 01:16:12.660
And they're part of this thing that I acknowledge and it's valid and it's, and it's explainable by this system that also acknowledges that racism is a real thing that you should also acknowledge exists in the world.

01:16:12.660 --> 01:16:14.660
And I'm not saying you're racist.

01:16:14.660 --> 01:16:16.660
You know, so like, I don't know.

01:16:16.660 --> 01:16:20.660
No, you're on it, you're on it because that's what we've been doing wrong.

01:16:20.660 --> 01:16:22.660
We've just been dismissing.

01:16:22.660 --> 01:16:26.660
Asperger Reddit guys, we're always saying to women and we're always going like, like, just shut up for a second.

01:16:26.660 --> 01:16:29.660
I'm trying to explain.

01:16:29.660 --> 01:16:35.660
It's like, we're always like, like someone else, someone will tell, post a story about like, I was in a parking lot and all this stuff happened.

01:16:35.660 --> 01:16:42.660
And then like, Spencer and me come from a world where we're like helping when we go, yeah, but however, you probably shouldn't assume that person.

01:16:42.660 --> 01:16:46.660
And it's like, and it's like, you're, yeah.

01:16:46.660 --> 01:16:47.660
Anyways, what were you going to say?

01:16:47.660 --> 01:16:54.660
Well, I mean, I like, I just think that we're that no one's listening and I do think that there are deep seated issues in our country.

01:16:54.660 --> 01:17:00.660
And it's, I think it starts with our shitty education system and we go to, I spent a lot of time in Appalachia.

01:17:00.660 --> 01:17:05.660
And I don't know if anyone else has, but like, but like, a lot of towns are derelict.

01:17:05.660 --> 01:17:10.660
Like they don't have money to even tear down buildings that that they don't know what to do with.

01:17:10.660 --> 01:17:13.660
And then they let like mountains just grow there.

01:17:13.660 --> 01:17:16.660
They don't even have funding for mountain clearing.

01:17:16.660 --> 01:17:19.660
But like, you know, we all believe that global warming is happening.

01:17:19.660 --> 01:17:21.660
So like, that's true.

01:17:21.660 --> 01:17:24.660
And green energy is good.

01:17:24.660 --> 01:17:32.660
Yet they're huge industries that have relied on coal mining and just the in the mining business.

01:17:32.660 --> 01:17:41.660
And they now are losing jobs, coal mining, coal mining businesses have been like almost fully shut down.

01:17:41.660 --> 01:17:47.660
And not, I mean, not fully, but they're, everyone's losing jobs and then you lose jobs and then no one wants to be a teacher.

01:17:47.660 --> 01:17:48.660
No one gets paid.

01:17:48.660 --> 01:17:51.660
No one can create a business because no one's going to go out to a restaurant.

01:17:51.660 --> 01:17:52.660
No one's going to give their money there.

01:17:52.660 --> 01:17:54.660
And then that, and then now they're all pissed.

01:17:54.660 --> 01:17:56.660
People have drug issues all over the country.

01:17:56.660 --> 01:17:57.660
No one pays attention to it.

01:17:57.660 --> 01:17:59.660
States have no tax revenue.

01:17:59.660 --> 01:18:07.660
And we're just, we're just, there's this cycle and people are mad and Trump made those people feel special also, as well as all the problems in the world.

01:18:07.660 --> 01:18:10.660
He said, he said, he said, how's everybody doing tonight?

01:18:10.660 --> 01:18:12.660
Oh, to section C.

01:18:12.660 --> 01:18:16.660
Like, like, like, like that was made a huge difference in the concert.

01:18:16.660 --> 01:18:22.660
And they, they came out and they voted and, and I don't know if he's going to fix their problems, but it's really fucking sad.

01:18:22.660 --> 01:18:28.660
And there is no alternative jobs for a lot of people who work in industries like that.

01:18:28.660 --> 01:18:38.660
And I just, I just think that we can, there's a way that we can go into areas and not have a political agenda and just understand.

01:18:38.660 --> 01:18:44.660
Okay, so you have a father, a grandfather who's been so angry for whatever reasons they didn't have an education.

01:18:44.660 --> 01:18:46.660
But you know what, you're the new generation.

01:18:46.660 --> 01:18:49.660
Let's figure out how to serve you better.

01:18:49.660 --> 01:18:52.660
Let's figure out an education system that's, that's better for you.

01:18:52.660 --> 01:18:57.660
And then maybe we can even figure out a way for you to express yourself beyond school.

01:18:57.660 --> 01:19:02.660
You can talk about all this weird shit happening in your head or what, you know, JJ said to you or whatever.

01:19:02.660 --> 01:19:05.660
Like, there's just, there's no, like, expression.

01:19:05.660 --> 01:19:08.660
Yeah, make, make your kids less into multicam.

01:19:08.660 --> 01:19:10.660
Yeah.

01:19:10.660 --> 01:19:15.660
From a TV perspective, it's just like, tell, tell them, tell them they have options.

01:19:15.660 --> 01:19:19.660
Like, there's like, like, it's just like, why would you want to hear other people laughing?

01:19:19.660 --> 01:19:21.660
It's okay to just laugh at what you want to laugh at.

01:19:21.660 --> 01:19:24.660
Right. And it seems like if, if parents are voted.

01:19:24.660 --> 01:19:30.660
I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to grind every ax I can while I still have a chance.

01:19:30.660 --> 01:19:32.660
Paul Bunyan's dying.

01:19:32.660 --> 01:19:35.660
No, but it's coming down from the generations and their parents.

01:19:35.660 --> 01:19:39.660
And then, you know, if we want to change something, it starts with educating young people.

01:19:39.660 --> 01:19:41.660
And that's what Hillary Clinton was all about.

01:19:41.660 --> 01:19:44.660
And we have a shitty fucking system in our, in our country.

01:19:44.660 --> 01:19:49.660
And I'm super proud of the fact that in California and Los Angeles is like these concentric strongholds of like, you know,

01:19:49.660 --> 01:19:55.660
we have like amazing, like if we choose to volunteer in LA overflowing, but when we were talking about this,

01:19:55.660 --> 01:20:00.660
and it's like, I don't know, I don't know if this is the most dumbest thing I've ever said or the smartest thing,

01:20:00.660 --> 01:20:04.660
but it's like, oh, people say white privilege and then your skin bristles.

01:20:04.660 --> 01:20:07.660
But it's like, oh, what if it was actually privileged?

01:20:07.660 --> 01:20:14.660
What if you could, for instance, what if you, I know you would be allowed to walk into a steel mill and nobody's going to be like,

01:20:14.660 --> 01:20:16.660
hey, who let Scarlet Witch in?

01:20:16.660 --> 01:20:17.660
I've gone to so many.

01:20:17.660 --> 01:20:18.660
So many steel mills?

01:20:18.660 --> 01:20:19.660
Steel mills?

01:20:19.660 --> 01:20:20.660
Coal mines.

01:20:20.660 --> 01:20:21.660
Name three.

01:20:21.660 --> 01:20:23.660
They're all in West Virginia and I don't remember what they're called.

01:20:23.660 --> 01:20:24.660
The Toulouseka load?

01:20:24.660 --> 01:20:27.660
The, see, you see like bust out this deadwood jargon.

01:20:27.660 --> 01:20:31.660
No, but that's, yeah, and that's, so what, well, what do you mean you bend to them?

01:20:31.660 --> 01:20:36.660
Because my ex-boyfriend's family was from, or is from Kentucky.

01:20:36.660 --> 01:20:37.660
Oh, you just bend to them?

01:20:37.660 --> 01:20:39.660
You don't, you know, like, you're not like Princess Diana, like going to them.

01:20:39.660 --> 01:20:40.660
Do you mind, Cole?

01:20:40.660 --> 01:20:46.660
No, I just, I literally just hung out and then he, he ended up making a film in, in West Virginia.

01:20:46.660 --> 01:20:52.660
And I was going to these places where, you know, at first everyone who's working in these,

01:20:52.660 --> 01:20:56.660
in these mines, they feel with you coming in camp with cameras.

01:20:56.660 --> 01:20:59.660
They're already assuming that you're coming in to make them look stupid.

01:20:59.660 --> 01:21:00.660
To make stock footage.

01:21:00.660 --> 01:21:01.660
To make fun of them.

01:21:01.660 --> 01:21:02.660
Yeah, they already think that.

01:21:02.660 --> 01:21:03.660
So they're really defensive.

01:21:03.660 --> 01:21:06.660
They just think, oh, you're going to make us look stupid in this movie.

01:21:06.660 --> 01:21:10.660
Because I've been pitching every time one of these camera crews comes in, I pitch my fucking show.

01:21:10.660 --> 01:21:12.660
No one listens.

01:21:12.660 --> 01:21:13.660
It's a good idea.

01:21:13.660 --> 01:21:17.660
It's about a guy who mines time.

01:21:17.660 --> 01:21:19.660
You can't fucking tell me that's not a good idea.

01:21:19.660 --> 01:21:21.660
But no, I got soot all over my face.

01:21:21.660 --> 01:21:23.660
So everyone's like, look at the jackass.

01:21:23.660 --> 01:21:25.660
What was, what's the show called?

01:21:25.660 --> 01:21:29.660
Time Miner, you fucking faggot.

01:21:29.660 --> 01:21:33.660
Fucking big city faggot.

01:21:33.660 --> 01:21:34.660
Can I get back to work?

01:21:34.660 --> 01:21:35.660
I'm sorry.

01:21:35.660 --> 01:21:36.660
Are you going to buy my show?

01:21:36.660 --> 01:21:37.660
I'm sorry.

01:21:37.660 --> 01:21:38.660
Let me get back to fucking work.

01:21:38.660 --> 01:21:48.660
Because you were handicapped, I'm sorry.

01:21:48.660 --> 01:21:51.660
I went to, I've been to Morgantown, West Virginia.

01:21:51.660 --> 01:21:53.660
That's where the college is, though, right?

01:21:53.660 --> 01:21:54.660
That's where the...

01:21:54.660 --> 01:21:55.660
Yeah, I haven't been there.

01:21:55.660 --> 01:21:57.660
That's where the mountaineers are.

01:21:57.660 --> 01:21:58.660
I do comedy shows.

01:21:58.660 --> 01:22:05.660
We'll go to rural areas, but we're usually around where the colleges are, which tend to lean a little bit more liberal.

01:22:05.660 --> 01:22:11.660
But when you get slightly out of town, you're in straight up red state, like real stuff.

01:22:11.660 --> 01:22:15.660
And some of the coolest, nicest, funniest, happiest people you'll ever meet in the world.

01:22:15.660 --> 01:22:29.660
Yeah, a lot of people that I, you know, I tried to, you know, exercise this thing of I have these, in my mind, educated beliefs and trying to be patient and listen.

01:22:29.660 --> 01:22:34.660
And all you can hear on the other end is, they are shit out of luck right now.

01:22:34.660 --> 01:22:36.660
Like, they don't have a lot to hold on to.

01:22:36.660 --> 01:22:38.660
And that's all you can think about.

01:22:38.660 --> 01:22:44.660
And you can't, and you don't, you can't then label it as, as stupid or ignorant.

01:22:44.660 --> 01:22:45.660
It's just...

01:22:45.660 --> 01:22:49.660
You also can't be like, oh, let's flood all of our passion into this ailing part of the country.

01:22:49.660 --> 01:22:54.660
Because every black woman that's not listening to this podcast, because I have zero black women listeners.

01:22:54.660 --> 01:22:55.660
Because I've already...

01:22:55.660 --> 01:22:56.660
That's not true.

01:22:56.660 --> 01:22:58.660
Oh, Brandon.

01:22:58.660 --> 01:23:02.660
Let's show that footage of 13 black women watching dance harm.

01:23:02.660 --> 01:23:03.660
Oh.

01:23:03.660 --> 01:23:06.660
I thought, I thought you just came out as trans.

01:23:06.660 --> 01:23:19.660
I just like, we have to like, we have to be like, okay, it was a terrible strategy for the Democrats to ignore what would be really uncharismatic, rightfully so, uncharismatic.

01:23:19.660 --> 01:23:38.660
It would be a hard thing to be trying to get the Democratic vote and to be honest and practical if you were really also simultaneously, in addition to trying to get the Democratic vote, also trying to be honest and declare an agenda for change.

01:23:38.660 --> 01:23:49.660
You're just shooting yourself in the foot, standing up behind any podium during that campaign and going, and let's not forget the beleaguered honky.

01:23:49.660 --> 01:23:57.660
Oh, languishing from his Bruce Springsteen factory, somewhere out there, wishing for more whiteness.

01:23:57.660 --> 01:23:59.660
Will he ever get what he deserves?

01:23:59.660 --> 01:24:01.660
Like, that is a Republican.

01:24:01.660 --> 01:24:03.660
That came to be a conservative thing.

01:24:03.660 --> 01:24:10.660
I was like, oh, because those guys are fiscal conservatives, which means they'll never win democratically.

01:24:10.660 --> 01:24:19.660
They have to attach that caboose to a train with an engine, which is a lot of people who are scared of gay people, scared of culture, scared of...

01:24:19.660 --> 01:24:32.660
And it's like, those lines get drawn, then you have Democrats going, oh, so everyone that's working with a welding torch in their hand is a moron who hates gay people,

01:24:32.660 --> 01:24:39.660
who's going to vote for George Bush, or is living in a district that's going to go red anyway, so fuck them.

01:24:39.660 --> 01:24:48.660
And also, I'd lose 10 black votes, even bothering to throw one of those Joe the Plumber fucking aside during any visit to anything, because fuck that guy.

01:24:48.660 --> 01:24:58.660
So what if, yeah, and it's like, this is why these lines, they have sucked us into a world wrestling franchise.

01:24:58.660 --> 01:25:02.660
They have told us there are good guys and there are bad guys.

01:25:02.660 --> 01:25:06.660
It doesn't really matter who. It's linked to all kinds of visceral stuff.

01:25:06.660 --> 01:25:09.660
There's an iron chic, and that's got all kinds of symbolic value.

01:25:09.660 --> 01:25:19.660
But we all know, we all celebrate on CNN and Fox News and in our living rooms, we all know that they don't actually represent those things.

01:25:19.660 --> 01:25:22.660
We all know that Donald Trump, for instance, does not work as a janitor.

01:25:22.660 --> 01:25:26.660
He does not weld anything. He's never successfully owned a business.

01:25:26.660 --> 01:25:32.660
I don't mean to get fucking controversial, and he's rapey.

01:25:32.660 --> 01:25:37.660
But we all know that he doesn't represent American value.

01:25:37.660 --> 01:25:44.660
We all know that politicians put on the show. They're professional wrestlers. They're symbols.

01:25:44.660 --> 01:25:53.660
We go like, oh, well, I don't expect Bill Clinton to say, I believe women are the future, and then go off and fondle them.

01:25:53.660 --> 01:25:57.660
He's a politician. He has to wear that blazer. That comes with fondling women.

01:25:57.660 --> 01:26:02.660
We make allowances for these performers because we accept that they're engaged in chicanery.

01:26:02.660 --> 01:26:07.660
We accept that we're idiots. We sit there and we cheer for symbols.

01:26:07.660 --> 01:26:12.660
We punish them for becoming real. We find photos of them smoking joints in college,

01:26:12.660 --> 01:26:18.660
and if that's not culturally right at that time, then we go, caught you, you weren't Hulk Hogan, your name was Terry.

01:26:18.660 --> 01:26:25.660
You can't be a wrestler anymore. You didn't come out of your mother's womb and grab a lion.

01:26:25.660 --> 01:26:30.660
We know it's fake, and then we insist, and then we wonder why.

01:26:30.660 --> 01:26:37.660
So we sit in this franchise, but then the mindblower is, when people who go to professional wrestling

01:26:37.660 --> 01:26:46.660
and who get to fucking get some of their feelings out by yelling at red guy versus blue guy in a ring,

01:26:46.660 --> 01:26:53.660
they get to leave that venue, get in their cars, go home, and decide how to watch television,

01:26:53.660 --> 01:26:58.660
how to order popcorn. Do you order popcorn? Again, out of touch.

01:26:58.660 --> 01:27:05.660
How to interact with, how to leave a comment under your favorite or least favorite thing.

01:27:05.660 --> 01:27:11.660
The reality that we're living in when you, the metaphor I'm talking about is they won't,

01:27:11.660 --> 01:27:16.660
they're never going to let us out. We have to leave the venue.

01:27:16.660 --> 01:27:22.660
And it's not a physical venue, but they have it built around all of our lives.

01:27:22.660 --> 01:27:31.660
We sleep and dream in it. Some people here tonight, I guarantee you, because that election was so volatile.

01:27:31.660 --> 01:27:38.660
So it was such an event. There are people here tonight who are here with boyfriends or girlfriends

01:27:38.660 --> 01:27:43.660
that are now their boyfriends or girlfriends because they broke up with someone on Tuesday.

01:27:43.660 --> 01:27:51.660
I bet 20% of people here tonight have gotten in fights and ended relationships.

01:27:51.660 --> 01:27:55.660
The people in the wrestling ring go into the back room and they do cocaine.

01:27:55.660 --> 01:27:59.660
And they're nuts shrivel up and they write books and they don't sell and they're sad.

01:27:59.660 --> 01:28:04.660
And then Mickey Rourke plays them in a movie and he even doesn't get an Oscar.

01:28:04.660 --> 01:28:09.660
They don't even be mad at them. They're just clowns.

01:28:09.660 --> 01:28:15.660
We just need to like, that's all I'm waking up to is like, holy shit man.

01:28:15.660 --> 01:28:21.660
How do we get out of there? And you get out of there like the moment you go like, oh, it's not real.

01:28:21.660 --> 01:28:27.660
It's not real. And I'm not saying don't vote. Vote for this crazy person right in your friend.

01:28:27.660 --> 01:28:30.660
Turn the poll over. I don't know man.

01:28:30.660 --> 01:28:34.660
I just like, like we got nothing but time now to go.

01:28:34.660 --> 01:28:40.660
Okay, so that happened. That's like an ice pick that goes down the middle of this block and it's like fragmented.

01:28:40.660 --> 01:28:43.660
And now it's all laid bare and there's chunks and all this shit.

01:28:43.660 --> 01:28:48.660
Be very careful as we pick up each chunk or as we clean up all this stuff.

01:28:48.660 --> 01:28:51.660
Are we going to do so under the religion that got us here?

01:28:51.660 --> 01:28:58.660
Which is the religion of division, the religion of these demographics that we found out can't even predict polls.

01:28:58.660 --> 01:29:04.660
If they were going to have any function, like they certainly never applied to who's going to give you a cup of sugar.

01:29:04.660 --> 01:29:07.660
Like we knew that. That was what all our stories were about.

01:29:07.660 --> 01:29:11.660
Oh, I thought that black guy was going to stab me according to CNN.

01:29:11.660 --> 01:29:14.660
But then he helped me change my tire.

01:29:14.660 --> 01:29:17.660
Or took my heart out of my chest.

01:29:17.660 --> 01:29:22.660
Oh, god damn it.

01:29:22.660 --> 01:29:26.660
The black people are stealing hearts now?

01:29:26.660 --> 01:29:31.660
Or the horrible story where I thought that black guy was going to help me change my tire.

01:29:31.660 --> 01:29:34.660
But he took my heart out of my chest.

01:29:34.660 --> 01:29:39.660
I just don't want to hear a story where I got a job out of this shit.

01:29:39.660 --> 01:29:44.660
I got sidetracked there because I got excited about a new thought about tachotomy.

01:29:44.660 --> 01:29:50.660
But what have I learned since I saw you guys?

01:29:50.660 --> 01:29:53.660
Nothing I ever think politically is going to happen.

01:29:53.660 --> 01:29:57.660
None of my predictions ever come true.

01:29:57.660 --> 01:30:05.660
We can't keep expressing ourselves about injustice that we're reading about on Facebook and the Walmarts.

01:30:05.660 --> 01:30:10.660
And the guys snatching those headscarves off and saying, you should hang yourself with us.

01:30:10.660 --> 01:30:15.660
It won't stop if we just, we should retweet it.

01:30:15.660 --> 01:30:19.660
The retweet won't stop it.

01:30:19.660 --> 01:30:22.660
It's part of the show you're talking about.

01:30:22.660 --> 01:30:25.660
It's fun. Andy Kaufman knew that.

01:30:25.660 --> 01:30:29.660
A boo is worth two laughs.

01:30:29.660 --> 01:30:31.660
But that doesn't mean don't talk about it.

01:30:31.660 --> 01:30:34.660
Don't go numb. I'm not telling you what to do.

01:30:34.660 --> 01:30:36.660
I'm telling you what I'm telling myself to do.

01:30:36.660 --> 01:30:39.660
Don't go numb. Stop being surprised.

01:30:39.660 --> 01:30:45.660
Figure out what the fuck to do.

01:30:45.660 --> 01:30:47.660
Communicate with each other.

01:30:47.660 --> 01:30:58.660
Be honest about, like, if you perceive any division between you and another person that has nothing to do with what you know about them as an individual,

01:30:58.660 --> 01:31:02.660
try just brave the lack of charisma that is.

01:31:02.660 --> 01:31:09.660
Well, I think, is it possible that the way we're talking to each other right now has something to do with the fact that you're a barista and I'm a customer?

01:31:09.660 --> 01:31:12.660
Because I don't fucking like, I didn't buy a ticket to that.

01:31:12.660 --> 01:31:14.660
I just want my coffee, bitch.

01:31:14.660 --> 01:31:15.660
No, sorry. Bad example.

01:31:15.660 --> 01:31:20.660
Well, that came off the rails pretty fast.

01:31:20.660 --> 01:31:25.660
Yeah, that wasn't, Dan, give us leadership. Tell us what to think. I'm failing.

01:31:25.660 --> 01:31:33.660
Well, I'll butt in to say that this election was so bad that it killed Leonard Cohen.

01:31:33.660 --> 01:31:34.660
Yes.

01:31:34.660 --> 01:31:38.660
But happily, Prince and Bowie weren't around to see this shit, which is great.

01:31:38.660 --> 01:31:40.660
They got out where the gutting was good. I love that.

01:31:40.660 --> 01:31:48.660
There's a funny tweet I saw that somebody said, like, Leonard Cohen's in heaven with Prince and Bowie now jamming out.

01:31:48.660 --> 01:31:56.660
But it's awful because their styles are so incompatible.

01:31:56.660 --> 01:32:00.660
Well, Leonard Cohen said there's a crack in everything. That's how the light gets in.

01:32:00.660 --> 01:32:05.660
So maybe this is a crack in that.

01:32:05.660 --> 01:32:06.660
It goes like this.

01:32:06.660 --> 01:32:12.660
That quote was tight as fuck.

01:32:12.660 --> 01:32:17.660
I guess the fourth, the fifth, the minor fall.

01:32:17.660 --> 01:32:19.660
The major lift.

01:32:19.660 --> 01:32:21.660
The baffled king composing.

01:32:21.660 --> 01:32:24.660
Well, that part's just like, what is that?

01:32:24.660 --> 01:32:25.660
It's the hook.

01:32:25.660 --> 01:32:29.660
We've been moving.

01:32:29.660 --> 01:32:31.660
It's also the title of the song.

01:32:31.660 --> 01:32:32.660
I know.

01:32:32.660 --> 01:32:35.660
We've been moving up.

01:32:35.660 --> 01:32:36.660
To the east side.

01:32:36.660 --> 01:32:42.660
To a deluxe apartment in the sky.

01:32:42.660 --> 01:32:44.660
When you get on Twitter.

01:32:44.660 --> 01:32:48.660
I thought you could start doing a weird Gregorian chant there.

01:32:48.660 --> 01:32:53.660
And someone tries to troll you by saying you're a piece of fucking shit.

01:32:53.660 --> 01:32:54.660
Fuck you.

01:32:54.660 --> 01:32:56.660
You shouldn't say that.

01:32:56.660 --> 01:33:00.660
Tell them fuck you.

01:33:00.660 --> 01:33:03.660
Because I don't think that they came there to connect with you.

01:33:03.660 --> 01:33:07.660
I think they came there to do that.

01:33:07.660 --> 01:33:09.660
And they should just get that back.

01:33:09.660 --> 01:33:14.660
And you shouldn't also put a corkscrew in the pillow case and be like,

01:33:14.660 --> 01:33:18.660
surprise motherfucker.

01:33:18.660 --> 01:33:22.660
You should just be like, fuck you poop face.

01:33:22.660 --> 01:33:25.660
Just say fuck you poop face.

01:33:25.660 --> 01:33:26.660
Don't be afraid.

01:33:26.660 --> 01:33:31.660
Don't make it your mission to prove that they can't hurt you.

01:33:31.660 --> 01:33:34.660
Our enemy is going to be dishonesty moving forward.

01:33:34.660 --> 01:33:36.660
That's what those guys who poked Camille in the chest.

01:33:36.660 --> 01:33:38.660
How dishonest can you get?

01:33:38.660 --> 01:33:42.660
When you need booze and a presence.

01:33:42.660 --> 01:33:46.660
To walk up to somebody and say, I don't like your politics.

01:33:46.660 --> 01:33:48.660
Everything those guys said was a lie.

01:33:48.660 --> 01:33:50.660
They came up and said they're big fans.

01:33:50.660 --> 01:33:52.660
And then wanted to harass them.

01:33:52.660 --> 01:33:53.660
They breathe lies.

01:33:53.660 --> 01:33:55.660
Everything they do is a lie.

01:33:55.660 --> 01:33:57.660
They're in their own hell.

01:33:57.660 --> 01:34:00.660
We're going to be fighting dishonesty.

01:34:00.660 --> 01:34:05.660
Frankly, don't trust your friend just because they're spouting some shit

01:34:05.660 --> 01:34:07.660
that suggests that they're liberal.

01:34:07.660 --> 01:34:10.660
Actually have a conversation with them.

01:34:10.660 --> 01:34:12.660
That's what friendship's about.

01:34:12.660 --> 01:34:13.660
Just ask them.

01:34:13.660 --> 01:34:17.660
Just find a Russian to go through your friend's emails and find out exactly.

01:34:17.660 --> 01:34:20.660
And confess your own shit and say like, hey, we're best friends.

01:34:20.660 --> 01:34:24.660
We've been pretty much resigned to the idea that we're liberal

01:34:24.660 --> 01:34:27.660
and we hate racism and xenophobia is bad.

01:34:27.660 --> 01:34:34.660
But you use the N word a lot when you're freestyling alone in your kitchen, right?

01:34:34.660 --> 01:34:37.660
Yes, yes, I do.

01:34:37.660 --> 01:34:41.660
Do you want my permission?

01:34:41.660 --> 01:34:42.660
I can give you my permission.

01:34:42.660 --> 01:34:44.660
Have that conversation with you.

01:34:44.660 --> 01:34:45.660
Oh, really?

01:34:45.660 --> 01:34:48.660
You can give out the permission?

01:34:48.660 --> 01:34:52.660
No, I said get that permission from yourself or your friend.

01:34:52.660 --> 01:34:54.660
You're a black friend, though.

01:34:54.660 --> 01:34:55.660
You should get a friend.

01:34:55.660 --> 01:35:00.660
No, your regime is over.

01:35:00.660 --> 01:35:02.660
I just told you.

01:35:02.660 --> 01:35:05.660
Don't you understand when I talk to you?

01:35:05.660 --> 01:35:06.660
Sorry.

01:35:06.660 --> 01:35:10.660
Brandon, Brandon, you're not content with eight years of black people ruling the world.

01:35:10.660 --> 01:35:14.660
Yeah, how much more of this shit do we have to put up with?

01:35:14.660 --> 01:35:17.660
We tried to help you.

01:35:17.660 --> 01:35:19.660
Oh, with the health care, the health care.

01:35:19.660 --> 01:35:23.660
As soon as these guys get in the White House, they're going to repeal.

01:35:23.660 --> 01:35:26.660
Yeah, whoops.

01:35:26.660 --> 01:35:31.660
Lizzie, I'm guessing you're a Hillary supporter, right?

01:35:31.660 --> 01:35:33.660
Were you hardcore?

01:35:33.660 --> 01:35:35.660
Were you like gung-mo?

01:35:35.660 --> 01:35:40.660
Yeah, I mean hardcore with my community of friends and family.

01:35:40.660 --> 01:35:46.660
What do you think the future for the next time a woman runs for president is?

01:35:46.660 --> 01:35:53.660
I may be wrong when I say that I think our country is more sexist and racist in lots of ways.

01:35:53.660 --> 01:35:56.660
We let freed black men vote before women.

01:35:56.660 --> 01:35:58.660
God damn it.

01:35:58.660 --> 01:36:02.660
There's both.

01:36:02.660 --> 01:36:07.660
Misogyny is a huge thing here.

01:36:07.660 --> 01:36:09.660
I don't know.

01:36:09.660 --> 01:36:14.660
It's not my place to say it, but I feel that there was a huge anti-women thing going on in this whole thing.

01:36:14.660 --> 01:36:18.660
We certainly will go kicking and screaming into letting a woman run our country.

01:36:18.660 --> 01:36:23.660
It was definitely weird that the entire election came down to three perverts.

01:36:23.660 --> 01:36:33.660
It was just a conversation about Trump grabbing pussy, Bill having this affair, and then Anthony Wiener showed up.

01:36:33.660 --> 01:36:43.660
And it was just all about three men in power who was the worst or evil of sexually offending women.

01:36:43.660 --> 01:36:45.660
I just thought that was so weird.

01:36:45.660 --> 01:36:49.660
And that was two weeks before we voted.

01:36:49.660 --> 01:36:51.660
It was just strange.

01:36:51.660 --> 01:36:54.660
I grew up in LA. I'm from LA.

01:36:54.660 --> 01:36:58.660
I feel very lucky with what I've been able to do.

01:36:58.660 --> 01:37:02.660
I don't feel it as me.

01:37:02.660 --> 01:37:05.660
I can't speak for other people.

01:37:05.660 --> 01:37:08.660
I don't feel that.

01:37:08.660 --> 01:37:12.660
I see racism more than I see sexism in my life.

01:37:12.660 --> 01:37:15.660
I don't know what that means.

01:37:15.660 --> 01:37:20.660
But I mean, with me, that's just my personal experience.

01:37:20.660 --> 01:37:24.660
I'm sure every single person here has a thousand personal experiences.

01:37:24.660 --> 01:37:36.660
It's hard because when those results came in, I was like, oh, because we sleep with them.

01:37:36.660 --> 01:37:39.660
Wait, but don't they sleep with you too?

01:37:39.660 --> 01:37:42.660
Well, that's the thing.

01:37:42.660 --> 01:37:45.660
I mean, you're allowed to go, yeah, but I don't know.

01:37:45.660 --> 01:37:47.660
It wasn't like, oh, I didn't know that.

01:37:47.660 --> 01:37:49.660
They were also sleeping with me.

01:37:49.660 --> 01:37:54.660
I'm talking about this irony that we always point to where we're like, man, yes.

01:37:54.660 --> 01:38:02.660
We're so misogynist that we, in the list of amendments, when you look at the history of our Constitution,

01:38:02.660 --> 01:38:07.660
the virus that is our country that we hope infects the planet and the universe,

01:38:07.660 --> 01:38:12.660
because it's that or Putin, am I right?

01:38:12.660 --> 01:38:14.660
It's sequence of DNA.

01:38:14.660 --> 01:38:17.660
When you backtrack through it, because there's a paper trail,

01:38:17.660 --> 01:38:28.660
we got woke about the idea that some people aren't animals before we decided women should participate in the election.

01:38:28.660 --> 01:38:31.660
And we were married to them before that.

01:38:31.660 --> 01:38:38.660
So that is the crazy thing to me, which also is an uplifting thing, because it further suggests,

01:38:38.660 --> 01:38:46.660
yeah, these lines, they're so much deeper than you would ever, that you can't see the right ones when you focus on the ones you can see.

01:38:46.660 --> 01:38:51.660
And people will use the ones you can see as a distraction from the ones you can't.

01:38:51.660 --> 01:39:02.660
And it's like, we are eight billion strong, like we have come to this point where we are elbow to elbow competing for oxygen with each other,

01:39:02.660 --> 01:39:04.660
which is supposed to be a crisis.

01:39:04.660 --> 01:39:10.660
So some of us are all thinking about, I think, instinctively like rats, how do I get rid of the wrong ones?

01:39:10.660 --> 01:39:11.660
How do I get some space?

01:39:11.660 --> 01:39:13.660
How do I get the brown ones back out of here?

01:39:13.660 --> 01:39:17.660
Maybe that gimmick worked when we were trying to build things, but they got to go.

01:39:17.660 --> 01:39:18.660
Like, I need some space.

01:39:18.660 --> 01:39:22.660
I think we're just reacting like insects or rats to the idea.

01:39:22.660 --> 01:39:29.660
It's not even like we experience it regularly, where we're like, I can't get into this Starbucks overpopulation.

01:39:29.660 --> 01:39:31.660
It's like, that's lunch hour.

01:39:31.660 --> 01:39:36.660
It's like Starbucks needs to get its shit together.

01:39:36.660 --> 01:39:43.660
I think that eight billion people going like this and being like, hi, how are you?

01:39:43.660 --> 01:39:44.660
Hi, Dan Harmon, nice to meet you.

01:39:44.660 --> 01:39:46.660
I remember you from the Marvel movie.

01:39:46.660 --> 01:39:48.660
Oh, hey, how are you, Brady? Good to see you again.

01:39:48.660 --> 01:39:50.660
That we're all rubbing up against each other.

01:39:50.660 --> 01:39:56.660
That is an invitation to like go granular.

01:39:56.660 --> 01:40:01.660
We keep looking at it as like, man, now more than ever, we really need to categorize ourselves.

01:40:01.660 --> 01:40:03.660
There's so many people and we're so squished together.

01:40:03.660 --> 01:40:05.660
We got to figure out, okay.

01:40:05.660 --> 01:40:08.660
And now it's going to Europe.

01:40:08.660 --> 01:40:12.660
And now, you know, France is probably, everyone's like scared of globalization.

01:40:12.660 --> 01:40:13.660
Everyone's scared of the other.

01:40:13.660 --> 01:40:14.660
Everyone's scared of anyone coming in.

01:40:14.660 --> 01:40:19.660
And this is a repeat of the things leading up to more scary than World War II, World War I,

01:40:19.660 --> 01:40:25.660
where isolationism, empty factories, economies in the toilet, everybody's starting to go,

01:40:25.660 --> 01:40:26.660
I'm going to stack weapons.

01:40:26.660 --> 01:40:27.660
You guys stacking weapons?

01:40:27.660 --> 01:40:33.660
Everything starts internationally, fucking machismo, total cool, like a billiard table.

01:40:33.660 --> 01:40:36.660
You guys going to stack weapons, stop doing trade?

01:40:36.660 --> 01:40:38.660
Yeah, gotcha, man.

01:40:38.660 --> 01:40:44.660
Like next game, and it's like fucking like tanks, bombs, things, and everybody's like,

01:40:44.660 --> 01:40:47.660
World War I is scarier than World War II.

01:40:47.660 --> 01:40:49.660
And that's like a lot of that shit's leading to now.

01:40:49.660 --> 01:40:52.660
But, however, here's the thing.

01:40:52.660 --> 01:41:02.660
America during World War II, because it was so historically wounded by World War I,

01:41:02.660 --> 01:41:08.660
it was like, another one?

01:41:08.660 --> 01:41:16.660
And that led to like this rugged, sad, lonely, angry, like kind of hunched over dude who was like,

01:41:16.660 --> 01:41:21.660
look, Nazi schmatze, all I see is a bunch of boats and a bunch of guns.

01:41:21.660 --> 01:41:22.660
You want some metal?

01:41:22.660 --> 01:41:23.660
You want some oil?

01:41:23.660 --> 01:41:24.660
Cash only.

01:41:24.660 --> 01:41:28.660
I don't know, I'm not taking credit, because one of you might take over the world,

01:41:28.660 --> 01:41:30.660
and the other one's not going to pay their bill.

01:41:30.660 --> 01:41:36.660
And we were, at that moment in my opinion, just as a student of history, it's like,

01:41:36.660 --> 01:41:38.660
I love that America.

01:41:38.660 --> 01:41:42.660
I love that poor, wounded child that just wants to make money.

01:41:42.660 --> 01:41:46.660
And profit off both sides of a huge genocidal catastrophe.

01:41:46.660 --> 01:41:54.660
No, but that thought that those oceans meant something, that before it went on to invent,

01:41:54.660 --> 01:41:59.660
those oceans not meeting anything, with all of its innovation, and all of its greed,

01:41:59.660 --> 01:42:00.660
all of its self-indulgence.

01:42:00.660 --> 01:42:06.660
We were a genius self-indulgent child locked in its bedroom, like so tired of the yelling,

01:42:06.660 --> 01:42:12.660
and then getting roped into more of it, and then we go, at our puberty at World War II,

01:42:12.660 --> 01:42:14.660
we go, well, what's in it for us?

01:42:14.660 --> 01:42:19.660
Because we're tired of being, you know, like, we've had the right idea the whole time,

01:42:19.660 --> 01:42:22.660
and you guys are just fucking around with this now, and we got dragged into this before.

01:42:22.660 --> 01:42:26.660
So give me some money, give me some money, and then we jump in, and then we go to the thing,

01:42:26.660 --> 01:42:29.660
and we go, all right, fuck you, Nazis, you're dead, you're dead, you're dead.

01:42:29.660 --> 01:42:31.660
Let's get these filing cabinets out of here.

01:42:31.660 --> 01:42:32.660
Whoa, this drawer came open.

01:42:32.660 --> 01:42:36.660
Shit, these guys were nailing it.

01:42:36.660 --> 01:42:42.660
Their overhead was zero, and their profit was a thousand percent, because they were Nazis.

01:42:42.660 --> 01:42:44.660
Maybe we should bring this back overseas.

01:42:44.660 --> 01:42:46.660
Everything went to shit.

01:42:46.660 --> 01:42:52.660
That's a fucking Alex Jones tangent that I don't want to...

01:42:52.660 --> 01:42:54.660
There is hope, there is hope.

01:42:54.660 --> 01:42:56.660
We don't have to repeat history, we don't have to do it.

01:42:56.660 --> 01:42:59.660
We are living in the exact circumstances.

01:42:59.660 --> 01:43:03.660
There's like a little bit of World War I, there's a little bit of World War II, these things building up.

01:43:03.660 --> 01:43:06.660
Yeah, and fascism is on the rise globally right now.

01:43:06.660 --> 01:43:11.660
America has always been in these little stories, well, because we learned from American history books,

01:43:11.660 --> 01:43:13.660
but we're the star.

01:43:13.660 --> 01:43:16.660
We have a certain position.

01:43:16.660 --> 01:43:19.660
I think Portugal is going to come back good and strong.

01:43:19.660 --> 01:43:28.660
We might be the ones this time to say, I see more profit in war.

01:43:28.660 --> 01:43:31.660
These bombs don't actually work, we were kidding.

01:43:31.660 --> 01:43:32.660
I don't think that's going to happen.

01:43:32.660 --> 01:43:40.660
I think if you draw a line from the beginning of empires to now, empires get big and they decline

01:43:40.660 --> 01:43:45.660
and they die really ignominious deaths and someone else takes over.

01:43:45.660 --> 01:43:49.660
And then there's fascism or totalitarianism.

01:43:49.660 --> 01:43:53.660
But I think somebody that lived in a certain other time would say, look, we've all seen this before.

01:43:53.660 --> 01:43:57.660
The dinosaurs come in, they eat the ostriches and then the ostriches turn into dinosaurs.

01:43:57.660 --> 01:44:01.660
And it's like, well, yeah, but at a certain point something goes extinct.

01:44:01.660 --> 01:44:06.660
Sir, I would like to see your math on that one.

01:44:06.660 --> 01:44:09.660
Nope, it's a new age, sir.

01:44:09.660 --> 01:44:12.660
You were saying the dinosaurs ate the ostriches and became ostriches?

01:44:12.660 --> 01:44:15.660
Saying there's little details that can be different.

01:44:15.660 --> 01:44:18.660
We might be able to be counted on as being the selfish ancient.

01:44:18.660 --> 01:44:20.660
But they're not different, we're ancient Rome right now.

01:44:20.660 --> 01:44:23.660
We're exactly the way that Spain fell.

01:44:23.660 --> 01:44:28.660
Only when you pull so far back that you acknowledge that the pattern is that things get big and then they fart.

01:44:28.660 --> 01:44:31.660
That's not brave to point out.

01:44:31.660 --> 01:44:35.660
Can we stop talking about you for one second, Daniel?

01:44:35.660 --> 01:44:38.660
It seems like the difference in this case is that we can get together.

01:44:38.660 --> 01:44:46.660
It's not as easy to say, oh, look, America is showing all the signs of a big global empire that's about to blow.

01:44:46.660 --> 01:44:52.660
It doesn't have to just be resigned to.

01:44:52.660 --> 01:44:59.660
Certainly not, but I don't think any empire ever thought they were resigning to a fate.

01:44:59.660 --> 01:45:03.660
I think they always thought that that was going to last a thousand years or 10,000 years.

01:45:03.660 --> 01:45:05.660
I draw a circle around your circle.

01:45:05.660 --> 01:45:08.660
I'm just saying, like, every time...

01:45:08.660 --> 01:45:10.660
I draw a triangle inside my circle.

01:45:10.660 --> 01:45:13.660
People keep trying to learn from history and not learn from history.

01:45:13.660 --> 01:45:16.660
We don't even know...

01:45:16.660 --> 01:45:21.660
The empires that we're describing, we're adjusting for inflation and going,

01:45:21.660 --> 01:45:24.660
well, it's been 300 years for America.

01:45:24.660 --> 01:45:30.660
Maybe we're supposed to become a planet by now, and it's supposed to be the planet that burns up into a cinder.

01:45:30.660 --> 01:45:34.660
Because that was a shitty empire, and it turns out the bees were writing the history books.

01:45:34.660 --> 01:45:39.660
And then they just have one picture and it's just Michael Jackson.

01:45:39.660 --> 01:45:41.660
That's our whole species.

01:45:41.660 --> 01:45:43.660
They're like...

01:45:43.660 --> 01:45:45.660
The book isn't even a book.

01:45:45.660 --> 01:45:49.660
It's just like a series of things that emulate a thorax wiggle.

01:45:49.660 --> 01:45:53.660
But when you read it, it's like an image.

01:45:53.660 --> 01:45:55.660
It's the essence of Michael Jackson's pheromones.

01:45:55.660 --> 01:45:58.660
And only Jodie Foster can translate it.

01:45:58.660 --> 01:46:00.660
But she's gone.

01:46:00.660 --> 01:46:03.660
Because we didn't believe in ourselves.

01:46:03.660 --> 01:46:04.660
Which is what I think we need to do.

01:46:04.660 --> 01:46:06.660
Jodie Foster's dead.

01:46:06.660 --> 01:46:09.660
We're all dead. It's just the bees now.

01:46:09.660 --> 01:46:17.660
You don't even have to be an optimist to start trying to organize your little corner of the world for the right.

01:46:17.660 --> 01:46:20.660
Because if you're a pessimist, follow that all the way through.

01:46:20.660 --> 01:46:22.660
Oh yeah, the world's fucked.

01:46:22.660 --> 01:46:23.660
It's the wild west.

01:46:23.660 --> 01:46:26.660
Any minute now, I might turn out to be a robot.

01:46:26.660 --> 01:46:29.660
A guy I'll find out when I get a bullet in my head.

01:46:29.660 --> 01:46:35.660
Therefore, obviously, then don't die a douche.

01:46:35.660 --> 01:46:39.660
Go down swinging if a Nazi is going to kill you.

01:46:39.660 --> 01:46:43.660
I'm learning how to wrap barbed wire around a two by four.

01:46:43.660 --> 01:46:48.660
And later, I'm going to learn how to lift it.

01:46:48.660 --> 01:46:50.660
But I'm hoping that when they get there, I'm going to go,

01:46:50.660 --> 01:46:53.660
Guys, look. Look what I can do.

01:46:53.660 --> 01:46:56.660
You guys got barbed wire?

01:46:56.660 --> 01:46:59.660
You got Nazi work to do?

01:46:59.660 --> 01:47:03.660
I'm your man. They call me Barbie, Barbie Tuba.

01:47:03.660 --> 01:47:05.660
Show me to your ammo dump.

01:47:05.660 --> 01:47:08.660
Let me show you what I can do when I got some real resources.

01:47:08.660 --> 01:47:11.660
And then I get in there and I go full fucking homeland.

01:47:11.660 --> 01:47:14.660
How do you connect?

01:47:14.660 --> 01:47:20.660
When you find, I'm assuming you just scrounged your barbed wire and your two by four.

01:47:20.660 --> 01:47:24.660
How do you connect the barbed wire onto the end of the two by four?

01:47:24.660 --> 01:47:27.660
The teeth sink into the wood as you wrap it around.

01:47:27.660 --> 01:47:30.660
You just have to wear really thick gloves.

01:47:30.660 --> 01:47:33.660
The trick isn't to figure out how to attach barbed wire to wood.

01:47:33.660 --> 01:47:38.660
Barbed wire is effective because it'll go through anything you hand it.

01:47:38.660 --> 01:47:43.660
That's why you need to work with baseball gloves.

01:47:43.660 --> 01:47:45.660
All of it's available from Amazon.

01:47:45.660 --> 01:47:48.660
I'm not here to do like an anarchist cookbook.

01:47:48.660 --> 01:47:51.660
You're going to find a couple of baseball gloves.

01:47:51.660 --> 01:47:56.660
Everything that you guys need to know about my political police as of this election

01:47:56.660 --> 01:47:59.660
can be heard in the Mike and the Mechanic song Silent Running.

01:47:59.660 --> 01:48:01.660
Go home and listen to it.

01:48:01.660 --> 01:48:08.660
Pledge allegiance to the flag, whatever flag they offer.

01:48:08.660 --> 01:48:11.660
Good song. Good song.

01:48:11.660 --> 01:48:13.660
Go back to Blondie.

01:48:13.660 --> 01:48:15.660
Just guys, really guys.

01:48:15.660 --> 01:48:18.660
Did you really, did you know her?

01:48:18.660 --> 01:48:21.660
I think we just got a guy back that likes Blondie a lot.

01:48:21.660 --> 01:48:22.660
Yeah.

01:48:22.660 --> 01:48:23.660
Yeah.

01:48:23.660 --> 01:48:28.660
Your Blondie is attention.

01:48:28.660 --> 01:48:31.660
And these people have been, they have Blondies.

01:48:31.660 --> 01:48:36.660
All right, my Blondie is being a handicapped person that have been a big joke tonight.

01:48:36.660 --> 01:48:41.660
But I guess, I guess, I guess walks a lot can talk for all he wants.

01:48:41.660 --> 01:48:44.660
Dan, I met a friend here, his name is Sylvon.

01:48:44.660 --> 01:48:47.660
He's from Paris, met him today.

01:48:47.660 --> 01:48:52.660
He reminded me that today is the one, today is the one year anniversary of the Paris attacks.

01:48:52.660 --> 01:48:56.660
And he's traveling the states by himself right now cruising around.

01:48:56.660 --> 01:48:59.660
And he couldn't have picked a more fun week to be.

01:48:59.660 --> 01:49:03.660
Well, also you're worried in, is it in France?

01:49:03.660 --> 01:49:09.660
There's like white, not white, there's like racial nationalism like popping up all over the globe, right?

01:49:09.660 --> 01:49:11.660
Marine Le Pen.

01:49:11.660 --> 01:49:13.660
Is it in France?

01:49:13.660 --> 01:49:15.660
Here, grab a microphone.

01:49:15.660 --> 01:49:19.660
Because all of us in America are going, France is fancy.

01:49:19.660 --> 01:49:21.660
They never go Nazi.

01:49:21.660 --> 01:49:22.660
That's how young we are.

01:49:22.660 --> 01:49:26.660
No, things are getting weirder since the last year.

01:49:26.660 --> 01:49:32.660
I don't know if there are more races, but there are more ways for them to express their racism, I guess.

01:49:32.660 --> 01:49:35.660
And we have an election in one year.

01:49:35.660 --> 01:49:39.660
So politicians are being politicians, I guess.

01:49:39.660 --> 01:49:42.660
But yeah, so it's getting pretty weird.

01:49:42.660 --> 01:49:49.660
And I guess with this election, we feel, I mean, from the social media today, like, I guess, yeah.

01:49:49.660 --> 01:49:52.660
We weren't expecting that result from the US.

01:49:52.660 --> 01:49:58.660
And then it's kind of scare everybody because everybody is like, hey, we shouldn't like do that next year.

01:49:58.660 --> 01:50:07.660
But it's getting, maybe, I don't think we're going to elect somebody that is as maybe obviously racist than yours.

01:50:07.660 --> 01:50:15.660
But it would be the same, like, maybe we have different codes so you cannot say the same things.

01:50:15.660 --> 01:50:18.660
But it doesn't mean that the people don't really think the same.

01:50:18.660 --> 01:50:21.660
So, and it's, yeah, I think it's pretty much the same.

01:50:21.660 --> 01:50:27.660
Like in Paris, you don't, I guess, feel it as much as in LA or San Francisco or like New York.

01:50:27.660 --> 01:50:34.660
But then you're, yeah, you have to have this big of an event to realize what's going on.

01:50:34.660 --> 01:50:40.660
That we're living in this world, like, I don't know how old you are, but all of us really, I'm always talking about, oh, you're 25 and 45.

01:50:40.660 --> 01:50:47.660
Like, all of us can be grouped into one group of people who, all of the kind of shit that we're thinking about right now,

01:50:47.660 --> 01:50:50.660
all of us thought of it as something from history books.

01:50:50.660 --> 01:50:52.660
Like, we all watched, we all looked at pictures of it.

01:50:52.660 --> 01:51:00.660
And there's something a little exciting about that for mostly straight white dudes who love sliders.

01:51:00.660 --> 01:51:04.660
Which is because it's like, we're, oh, we're a sliders.

01:51:04.660 --> 01:51:08.660
Anyway, thank you, thank you, Frenchie. That was nice.

01:51:08.660 --> 01:51:10.660
Frenchie!

01:51:10.660 --> 01:51:12.660
Thank you, Siobhan.

01:51:12.660 --> 01:51:21.660
I hope that your experience with America that you're traveling on this trip has been a positive one and not a horribly depressing one.

01:51:21.660 --> 01:51:23.660
There's one guy, I know it's 10 o'clock.

01:51:23.660 --> 01:51:30.660
There's one guy, scared to not bring him up, because like, I've seen his tweets, he's like calling out.

01:51:30.660 --> 01:51:32.660
Is it you?

01:51:32.660 --> 01:51:34.660
I don't know.

01:51:34.660 --> 01:51:38.660
I don't, it wasn't, but it is now.

01:51:38.660 --> 01:51:40.660
Hey, BJ, how are you?

01:51:40.660 --> 01:51:42.660
But BJ, how's it going?

01:51:42.660 --> 01:51:44.660
It's BJ Abril.

01:51:44.660 --> 01:51:49.660
Wow, BJ, wearing a silver Mylar space suit.

01:51:49.660 --> 01:51:55.660
Okay, well, I mean, is there, is there a soundbite that goes with it, or could it just be a photo app?

01:51:55.660 --> 01:51:56.660
I'm from the future.

01:51:56.660 --> 01:51:58.660
Okay, do you have anything to tell us from the future?

01:51:58.660 --> 01:52:02.660
You can use, don't use my mic, I need control.

01:52:02.660 --> 01:52:04.660
Yeah, everything's great.

01:52:04.660 --> 01:52:06.660
Okay, all right.

01:52:06.660 --> 01:52:07.660
All right, BJ, thanks for coming up.

01:52:07.660 --> 01:52:08.660
All right.

01:52:08.660 --> 01:52:11.660
Thank you.

01:52:11.660 --> 01:52:13.660
It is interesting.

01:52:13.660 --> 01:52:15.660
He was always very seven years old.

01:52:15.660 --> 01:52:17.660
That was the most man camel toe I've ever seen.

01:52:17.660 --> 01:52:19.660
Here's the guy.

01:52:19.660 --> 01:52:22.660
You ever only seen camel toe until this BJ silver camel toe?

01:52:22.660 --> 01:52:25.660
I don't want to rule out anybody that says this right now, because I don't have the solutions.

01:52:25.660 --> 01:52:30.660
There was a kid guy who was tweeting me, all people are kids to me, 43.

01:52:30.660 --> 01:52:35.660
What, you had a human party, you wanted to start a political party, where are you?

01:52:35.660 --> 01:52:36.660
What's, no?

01:52:36.660 --> 01:52:37.660
Are you here?

01:52:37.660 --> 01:52:38.660
You didn't even come to the show.

01:52:38.660 --> 01:52:39.660
Okay.

01:52:39.660 --> 01:52:40.660
Oh, is that a rent that's too high?

01:52:40.660 --> 01:52:41.660
Not exactly George Washington.

01:52:41.660 --> 01:52:43.660
I guess we don't have to follow him.

01:52:43.660 --> 01:52:48.660
I thought I saw some tweets from him, like several, it was like, I'm starting a human party.

01:52:48.660 --> 01:52:49.660
I'll come to the show.

01:52:49.660 --> 01:52:50.660
I'll talk about it.

01:52:50.660 --> 01:52:53.660
And I'm like, all right, well, you know, he'll probably be a drag.

01:52:53.660 --> 01:52:57.660
But then I was like, I was feeling, I was like, let's bring him up.

01:52:57.660 --> 01:52:58.660
He's been so quiet.

01:52:58.660 --> 01:53:00.660
He didn't come.

01:53:00.660 --> 01:53:05.660
I say that a human party won't come unless you respond to their tweets.

01:53:05.660 --> 01:53:06.660
Yeah.

01:53:06.660 --> 01:53:10.660
And that's why humans need to be forgiven for being shitty.

01:53:10.660 --> 01:53:15.660
I say we re-invoke the babes, the funky music, and we maybe sing our way out of this thing.

01:53:15.660 --> 01:53:16.660
Yeah, of course.

01:53:16.660 --> 01:53:23.660
Well, we're not going to vote our way out of a show.

01:53:23.660 --> 01:53:28.660
Don't vote boo.

01:53:28.660 --> 01:53:30.660
I hope that's not the message you.

01:53:30.660 --> 01:53:35.660
I don't know what message you should have gotten.

01:53:35.660 --> 01:53:40.660
We got kind of a funky Leonard Cohen rap going on here right now.

01:53:40.660 --> 01:53:41.660
Yo.

01:53:41.660 --> 01:53:42.660
Yeah.

01:53:42.660 --> 01:53:46.660
Well, actually, you know, why rap?

01:53:46.660 --> 01:53:47.660
Same.

01:53:47.660 --> 01:53:57.660
Sunshine comes before nighttime.

01:53:57.660 --> 01:54:01.660
Or is it the other way around?

01:54:01.660 --> 01:54:06.660
When the time goes round, does day come before night?

01:54:06.660 --> 01:54:16.660
Or does night come before day?

01:54:16.660 --> 01:54:22.660
Our funky mama on a beach.

01:54:22.660 --> 01:54:26.660
Yeah.

01:54:26.660 --> 01:54:28.660
Lizzie, you want to take a pic?

01:54:28.660 --> 01:54:29.660
Nope.

01:54:29.660 --> 01:54:30.660
She's got it.

01:54:30.660 --> 01:54:31.660
You got this?

01:54:31.660 --> 01:54:32.660
Yo.

01:54:32.660 --> 01:54:33.660
Take it, baby.

01:54:33.660 --> 01:54:34.660
I figured I'd give it to you.

01:54:34.660 --> 01:54:35.660
No, take it.

01:54:35.660 --> 01:54:38.660
Are you sure you don't want to hold it for just a second?

01:54:38.660 --> 01:54:39.660
Yo.

01:54:39.660 --> 01:54:40.660
Sunshine, brightly.

01:54:40.660 --> 01:54:41.660
I do.

01:54:41.660 --> 01:54:42.660
This show nightly.

01:54:42.660 --> 01:54:43.660
I almost mess up.

01:54:43.660 --> 01:54:44.660
I pass it to you.

01:54:44.660 --> 01:54:45.660
Jeff Davis, what you going to do?

01:54:45.660 --> 01:54:46.660
I'll go.

01:54:46.660 --> 01:54:47.660
I'll go as free as I can be.

01:54:47.660 --> 01:54:59.660
I don't like a dude who's better dressed than me.

01:54:59.660 --> 01:55:00.660
Sunshine.

01:55:00.660 --> 01:55:03.660
But yo, it's time for all of us to put our best suit on.

01:55:03.660 --> 01:55:05.660
Be the best purple you could be.

01:55:05.660 --> 01:55:08.660
Recruitant people looking better than you.

01:55:08.660 --> 01:55:09.660
Put a suit on.

01:55:09.660 --> 01:55:11.660
Yo, navy blue is where to go.

01:55:11.660 --> 01:55:12.660
Sunshine.

01:55:12.660 --> 01:55:13.660
Where do I begin?

01:55:13.660 --> 01:55:14.660
And my man is over there.

01:55:14.660 --> 01:55:15.660
No wrinkle on your linen.

01:55:15.660 --> 01:55:18.660
How do you wear a linen suit and get no wrinkles on it?

01:55:18.660 --> 01:55:22.660
Yo, I got a bee in my bonnet.

01:55:22.660 --> 01:55:23.660
Nicely done.

01:55:23.660 --> 01:55:24.660
Yeah.

01:55:24.660 --> 01:55:29.660
Sunshine comes before night time.

01:55:29.660 --> 01:55:32.660
Or is it the other way around?

01:55:32.660 --> 01:55:35.660
All the time goes around.

01:55:35.660 --> 01:55:41.660
When sunshine comes before night time, it's the refrain.

01:55:41.660 --> 01:55:46.660
Yo, my name is Mr. Bitch.

01:55:46.660 --> 01:55:48.660
On my shoulder.

01:55:48.660 --> 01:55:50.660
I don't belong here.

01:55:50.660 --> 01:55:51.660
No.

01:55:51.660 --> 01:55:52.660
No.

01:55:52.660 --> 01:55:57.660
I'm making a sacrificial gesture to not be involved because my energy is toxic.

01:55:57.660 --> 01:56:00.660
My name is Mr. Bitch.

01:56:00.660 --> 01:56:03.660
How do you parse that with this situation?

01:56:03.660 --> 01:56:05.660
Of course, the nation.

01:56:05.660 --> 01:56:08.660
We just had a Nazi election nation.

01:56:08.660 --> 01:56:11.660
You don't need Mr. Bitch to talk.

01:56:11.660 --> 01:56:12.660
I should go away.

01:56:12.660 --> 01:56:13.660
Sunshine.

01:56:13.660 --> 01:56:22.660
Thank you for coming to Harmontown, everybody.

01:56:22.660 --> 01:56:25.660
Let's hear from Brandon Johnson.

01:56:25.660 --> 01:56:29.660
Elizabeth Olson.

01:56:29.660 --> 01:56:33.660
Spencer Crittenden.

01:56:33.660 --> 01:56:35.660
I'm Jeff Davis.

01:56:35.660 --> 01:56:42.660
Also, the groovy undertones and overtones of the babes, babes, everybody.

01:56:42.660 --> 01:56:52.660
Well, stick with us because nothing can happen in a week that we can't solve here.

01:56:52.660 --> 01:56:54.660
We'll figure it out.

01:56:54.660 --> 01:56:57.660
We're converting our podcast to a solutions-based podcast.

01:56:57.660 --> 01:56:58.660
All right.

01:56:58.660 --> 01:57:04.660
Let's hear from your mayor, Dan Harmon.

01:57:04.660 --> 01:57:27.660
Drive fast and take chances, everybody.

01:57:27.660 --> 01:57:29.660
You get any of that?

01:57:29.660 --> 01:57:36.660
It's a good show.
