00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
Cereal Audio.

00:19.000 --> 00:23.000
Hello, Wendell and all. Welcome to Largo in Los Angeles, California.

00:23.000 --> 00:29.000
A very special Harmontown is now in session.

00:29.000 --> 00:46.000
Wendell and all, please welcome to the stage the Mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
Dennis foamed his beer.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
Alright, sorry about that.

01:04.000 --> 01:12.000
Well, this should be a real, as is usually promised, we really got to keep this thing moving on Ruby Rails, Jeff.

01:12.000 --> 01:17.000
I mean, for the podcast listener, there is a dais.

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
There are four chairs, which bodes well.

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
And there is what can only be described as a Stanley cup full of vodka.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
And two bottles.

01:28.000 --> 01:32.000
Well, this is Alliance member level.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
Alright, thank you, Kettle One.

01:35.000 --> 01:42.000
Dan Harmon, a new member of the, for me, unknown Alliance club for Kettle One vodka.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
The real cirrhosis club.

01:44.000 --> 01:50.000
Alright, we got to pack 90 minutes of excitement into 45 and we got three guests, Jeff.

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
Okay, Dan, we started at 8.13, we started at 8.12.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
Do I have to stop at 45 from 8.12?

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
45 from now? Yeah.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
I don't know.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
Let's just call it fucking nine.

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
We're going to be done with Harmontown, then we get into the next stuff.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
I don't know.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
Alright.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
I've never been on stage at Largo.

02:06.000 --> 02:11.000
If something really funny happens in five seconds, we're going to end the show.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
Well, I'll go to the Roger Room and get fucked up.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
I'm Fernette Broncker.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
Largo has a rich history.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
The legendary Flanagan runs this place.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
The lovely Flanagan.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
Thank you, Flanagan, for having us.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
Flanny to his friends.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
He got Jack Black hooked on heroin here.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
Yeah.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
He killed Grand Parsons.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
He killed...

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
A lot of people don't know that.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
He actually murdered Grand Parsons.

02:34.000 --> 02:40.000
Andy Kindler's balls were hit with a hammer by...

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
Andy did.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
...Amy Mann over in the corner.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
I don't know.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
Largo people.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
It's a rich, rich tapestry of history.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
Largo people.

02:49.000 --> 02:54.000
We're honored to be here and we're going to show you some Rick and Morty stuff later.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
Alright, Sam.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
I'm worried.

02:58.000 --> 03:04.000
I'm worried that because you're seated with a giant flagon of vodka right now that you

03:04.000 --> 03:08.000
won't be as dynamic as you normally are at Meltdown Comics when you stand up and treat

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
the people.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
No, it's fine.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
What good does expressing the worry do?

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
What are you going to...

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
Is that like a hot air balloon?

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
No.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
It's like the fire will make me go higher?

03:17.000 --> 03:21.000
It's a challenge, I'm saying, if you're going to be seated, fucking bring the thunder.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
I'm bringing it.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
Name a topic.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
I heard socks.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
I got these socks.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
They don't match.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
Okay, what else?

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
I heard firemen.

03:31.000 --> 03:35.000
What takes them so long?

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
Racism.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
Racism?

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
What's with black people?

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
Why are they so bad?

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
Shit.

03:41.000 --> 03:45.000
See, if you were standing, you would have been more racist.

03:45.000 --> 03:50.000
My intention was to come down against racism, not a race.

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
Sorry, black people.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
Again.

03:54.000 --> 03:58.000
All right, so I think we need to bring up our first guest right away.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
We have a fucking surfeit of celebrity guests.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
This is too much to do.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
There's too much to do.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
There's no time to fucking dick about.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
What have you been up to?

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
I've gained a lot of weight.

04:10.000 --> 04:17.000
There's two thresholds I crossed when I gained a certain amount of weight in an ascending

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
order of disturbance.

04:20.000 --> 04:26.000
The first is back pain, because I'm walking for two.

04:26.000 --> 04:31.000
Actually, just notice at a certain point that my back hurts, and then I think back

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
and go, oh, was I carrying something?

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
Yes, I was, but not with my arms.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
It was an extra.

04:36.000 --> 04:40.000
The second thing is a little thing called sleep apnea for those of you in the audience

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
who are familiar with this.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
This is when you get so fat that when you're asleep.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
How fat are you?

04:45.000 --> 04:52.000
When you're asleep, sometimes your body forgets you're supposed to be alive.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
That's sleep apnea.

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
Your body forgets to breathe.

04:56.000 --> 05:01.000
You wake up going, grrr, because you're that fat.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
Have you been fatter than right now?

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
Have you been fatter?

05:05.000 --> 05:09.000
Ask an objective observer.

05:09.000 --> 05:13.000
Is Pluto fatter than Mercury?

05:13.000 --> 05:19.000
You're not going to get a definitive answer from anyone other than Earth.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
Have you weighed more than you currently weigh?

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
I don't weigh myself.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
I don't truck with that.

05:23.000 --> 05:28.000
Have you looked in the mirror and been less or more disappointed than you are right now?

05:28.000 --> 05:32.000
Mirrors play tricks.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
Funhouse mirrors play tricks.

05:34.000 --> 05:39.000
I saw some Communicon photos that were a bummer.

05:39.000 --> 05:46.000
I was like, is that Dan Aykroyd at the Madame Tussaud museum?

05:46.000 --> 05:50.000
Is that a planet of hair?

05:50.000 --> 05:56.000
I do a bit in the community writer's room where I have two characters named Sam and Diane

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
that are on opposite sides of my gut.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
Where are you?

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
Sam!

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
Diane, I can't find you.

06:02.000 --> 06:07.000
Okay, let's bring out our first guest.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
He's my partner.

06:09.000 --> 06:14.000
This is a cleverly disguised advertisement for our show Rick and Morty.

06:14.000 --> 06:23.000
Our first guest is co-creator of Rick and Morty, Justin Roiland.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
Hi, buddy.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
Hey, how are you?

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
How are you?

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
You know, I just want to say I think you look as svelte as ever.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
Thanks, buddy.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
I don't know about all this talk about being overweight.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
You look beautiful.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
Thanks, Justin.

06:35.000 --> 06:39.000
And after the show, I got a bag of Doritos waiting for you with your name on it.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
Oh, he's like the Colonel and I'm Elvis.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
He's hooking me.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
I'm like an enably.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
He keeps me going with riboflavin.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
He's like Flanagan to Graham Parsons.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
Yeah.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
Yeah.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
Murdered Graham Parsons, you guys.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
Hey, listen, it's an honor to be here.

06:54.000 --> 06:59.000
And boy, oh boy, do we have something really special in store for all of you tonight.

06:59.000 --> 07:02.000
Justin has a thing he was talking about backstage.

07:02.000 --> 07:08.000
Now, you're a guy who on any given day, you'll talk about Skull Island with the gold and the reserves and the...

07:08.000 --> 07:13.000
Talk about the fucking Woodrow Wilson, the Federal Reserve, fucking Jekyll Island.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
You're sort of a doomsday prepper.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
You're kind of a...

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
I mean, listen, a show of hands.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
I can't see you because the lights are bright.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
But a show of hands.

07:21.000 --> 07:26.000
How many people think this country is just going right down into the poopy hole?

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
Can I get a show of hands?

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
Well, nobody's going to.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
Anybody?

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
Who's going to...

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
You think Captain America's here?

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
Everyone's raising their hands.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
Like one guy is going to be like two sparklers and...

07:35.000 --> 07:39.000
No one profits from saying that America's doing great.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
That was the 40s.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
But you know...

07:42.000 --> 07:46.000
The only way to earn a dollar right now is to say we're fucked.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
That's the only thing that anyone's buying.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
We're really fucked, ladies and gentlemen.

07:49.000 --> 07:53.000
And if you just put a dollar on the edge of the stage there...

07:53.000 --> 07:59.000
But you, specifically, you think that we're fucked for a really specific Art Bell kind of reason.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
Well, here's the thing.

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
We do know that the Earth is being polluted.

08:03.000 --> 08:10.000
We do know that we, as a human race, we've crossed a threshold in technology that is causing just chaos.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
I mean, we're all glued to these fucking little tablet screens and everything.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
And we probably think, hey, this is good for us.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
This is great and wonderful.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
Seems healthy.

08:18.000 --> 08:27.000
But what you don't realize is that for the last century, the gray almond-eyed aliens have been living among us.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
I'm not trying to be funny.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
I'm not trying to fucking be a...

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
You know, I'm dead serious.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
I believe this to be true.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
And I know that they've been here.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
You're still being funny.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
Look, you can laugh.

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
You can laugh with me or at me.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
But you have to laugh.

08:43.000 --> 08:47.000
But I'd prefer you laugh at me if you don't believe it.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
Because it's true.

08:49.000 --> 08:55.000
And they are here to enslave the human race and take the planet Earth from us.

08:55.000 --> 08:59.000
And they're going to come here and they're going to say, oh, we want to fix it all for you.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
You're polluting it.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
And you're doing this and that and the other thing.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
But guess what, ladies and gentlemen?

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
We're the gray-eyed almond-shaped eye aliens.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
And we're here.

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
And we're going to go ahead and fix it all for you.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
We're going to get rid of the nuclear bombs.

09:12.000 --> 09:16.000
We're going to get rid of all the shit China's doing and polluting the waters and all that shit.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
So they're going to come to Earth and they're going to say, we're here to help you with China.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
Exactly.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
But.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
But.

09:22.000 --> 09:26.000
And China's going to go, you have almond eyes.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
How can you do this?

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
Same team.

09:29.000 --> 09:34.000
Your eyes are shaped like beautiful almonds.

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
And the almond farmers especially are going to be upset about this.

09:37.000 --> 09:42.000
But the fact remains, don't trust these fucking aliens.

09:42.000 --> 09:49.000
They're coming to enslave us, to take over the planet and to harvest the resources of Earth.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
And questions, please.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
Should we introduce them?

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
One question before we bring out our panel of questionnaires.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
Our esteemed panel.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
Those resources are in order.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
Yes.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
Water.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
Gold.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
I don't know.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
All right.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
You know what?

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
Tell them water, dirt.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
I mean, you know.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
We've got a lot of dirt here.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
Let's bring out some professional.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
Oxygen.

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
So people who plan.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
Isn't it hydrogen they want?

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
That makes fuel.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
Listen, man.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
This planet is very rare.

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
I mean, ask your local scientist at the scientist center.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
How many other Earths have they found yet?

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
That fit the description.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
How many scientist centers have you found?

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
Not.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
Well, there is.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
You're right.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
My favorite thing is that you brought out your phone because when you were going to

10:30.000 --> 10:34.000
warn people about the alien invasion, there's some shit you might forget.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
It's not that important yet.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
Silent green is.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
Hold on a second.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
Oh, yeah.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
Silent green is people.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
I had to come prepared.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
I had to come prepared.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
I am doing this for you.

10:47.000 --> 10:52.000
I had to make sure I didn't forget any of the most important things that have to do with

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
my message that I'm delivering to you people.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
And I hope you spread it after tonight.

10:56.000 --> 11:00.000
Well, I have a surprise for you because we have a bona fide global level journalist here

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
from the Daily Show, Mr. John Oliver.

11:03.000 --> 11:15.000
He's a professional.

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
He's a professional.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
Wow.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
Wow.

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
You know how to sell your show.

11:25.000 --> 11:30.000
You have to get on the Tonight Show before Leno leaves to promote Rick and Morty.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
I don't want to talk about it, Jay.

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
We're all working for aliens.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
You're all living a lie.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
Yeah, I'll stay after the break.

11:39.000 --> 11:43.000
Sure, yeah.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
John, do you have any questions?

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
I have so many questions.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
Go ahead, try.

11:48.000 --> 11:54.000
But there's not so much about aliens as the source of which this information is coming from.

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
What's happening in your head?

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
The truth is happening in my head.

11:59.000 --> 12:04.000
You sound like Rand Paul's more extreme brother.

12:04.000 --> 12:08.000
Listen, I have a direct connection to the others.

12:08.000 --> 12:14.000
They are a very far off race that is sending me telepathic messages

12:14.000 --> 12:18.000
and letting me know that I must communicate to humanity.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
Well, then you're the threat.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
What?

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
Just because someone has all my eyes.

12:23.000 --> 12:27.000
I'm more scared of the guy with a mental connection to another.

12:27.000 --> 12:31.000
You know, you want to be scared of people with mental connections, then...

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
I can't wait to hear where this sentence is going.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
I cannot wait.

12:35.000 --> 12:38.000
I just want to enjoy the moment of that sentence hanging in the air.

12:38.000 --> 12:42.000
Now finish it.

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
I really, I don't have any...

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
Ask me a question, go ahead.

12:49.000 --> 12:53.000
Justin, what's your big fear when the aliens come?

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
What's the first thing that they're going to affect?

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
The biggest fear is that, you know, well, they're going to come down

12:59.000 --> 13:03.000
and they're going to say, all right, y'all, here's the deal.

13:03.000 --> 13:07.000
We're a bunch of almond-eyed aliens.

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
And y'all are real scared of us.

13:10.000 --> 13:13.000
But hold on to your seatbelts,

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
because we're here to get rid of all the trouble, right?

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
They sound nice.

13:18.000 --> 13:21.000
I know, I have a southern accent and yeah.

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
And then, and then, and then, you know, what's really going to happen is

13:24.000 --> 13:27.000
they're going to start to, well, what they've been doing for the last century.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
Wait, wait, what?

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
Oh, sorry, sorry, did I skip too far ahead?

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
They've been, for the last century.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
The almond-eyed aliens have been here for a century?

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
Yeah, yeah, they've been here for a century.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
And what they've been doing is they've been abducting humans

13:38.000 --> 13:41.000
and then they've been fucking, like, interbreeding and shit

13:41.000 --> 13:45.000
and causing this, because the problem is they can't survive in our atmosphere.

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
They can't, they can't survive in our atmosphere.

13:48.000 --> 13:51.000
And the reason why is because they're a fucking alien with almond eyes,

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
they don't survive in this atmosphere.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
So what do they do?

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
What do they do?

13:56.000 --> 13:59.000
They live underwater in spaceships, they live underground.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
Not really, Justin.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
Yeah, go ahead.

14:01.000 --> 14:04.000
Justin, what is your beef with almond-shaped eyes?

14:04.000 --> 14:09.000
Also, what is the advantage for the aliens to have almond-shaped eyes?

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
What sort of edge does that give you?

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
Well, you got me there.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
You got me there.

14:14.000 --> 14:18.000
I'm not even going to try to have an answer for you on that one.

14:18.000 --> 14:23.000
In their galaxy, there was, like, you know, there was, a million years ago,

14:23.000 --> 14:27.000
there was a huge, like, race war between aliens with saucer-shaped eyes

14:27.000 --> 14:31.000
and aliens that just had a nightrider slit across their face.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
Yes, thank you.

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
You know, it's not just about answers, you're posing questions,

14:35.000 --> 14:39.000
or you're at least inflecting up at the end of a sentence.

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
I have another surprise for you, Justin.

14:42.000 --> 14:45.000
I'm trying to ease these people into the reality.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
Well, you did not do that.

14:46.000 --> 14:49.000
In no sense did you ease anyone into anything.

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
You came in hot.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
You created chaos.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
There was no sense if I got a couple of anecdotes,

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
and then it was, you came in shouting at traffic.

14:59.000 --> 15:05.000
Listen, you know, you want to believe what you want to believe.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
That's fine.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
But I'm telling you right now, they are here.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
They've been doing all this crazy shit.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
What's your proof?

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
What evidence do you have to convince me?

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
That's a really good question.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
Kentrails?

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
No.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
I have another surprise for you.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
Yeah, go ahead.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
We have a medical expert here.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
Jesus Christ.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
Yes.

15:23.000 --> 15:26.000
She worked at St. Scrubs for eight years under Bill Lawrence.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
Please welcome Sarah Chalk.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
Yeah!

15:29.000 --> 15:38.000
And she found out she was doing the show tonight.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
Was it tonight?

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
Because you followed me on Twitter?

15:41.000 --> 15:45.000
Thank God I follow at Dan Harmon on Twitter.

15:45.000 --> 15:49.000
Otherwise, I'd be like, the dude shouldn't show up tonight.

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
I was reading his Twitter, and it was like,

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
at Dan Harmon, at Largo, with at John Oliver,

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
and I just didn't really do that, Sarah Chalk.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
And I was like, oh, I think that's me.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
I apologize.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
And then I also get emails from Largo,

16:04.000 --> 16:07.000
which then confirmed that.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
You are to be here tonight?

16:09.000 --> 16:12.000
So have you heard Justin's theories as a medical professional?

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
Well, that's not actually why he brought me here.

16:15.000 --> 16:19.000
I would prefer a de-bonified journalist introduction.

16:19.000 --> 16:24.000
I'm even less a journalist than you are a doctor.

16:24.000 --> 16:29.000
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm actually one of the results of the interbreeding.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
I don't know if you've noticed my eye shape.

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
Sarah, you play the mom on Rick and Morty.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
That's why you're really here.

16:35.000 --> 16:39.000
And John Oliver plays a guest in the...

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
We're going to be showing two episodes.

16:42.000 --> 16:47.000
And John Oliver plays a wonderful character in the second one,

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
the Christmas one, which you'll see tonight.

16:49.000 --> 16:52.000
I really hope that when you press play, it's not an episode.

16:52.000 --> 16:55.000
It's just your face ranting more about aliens.

16:55.000 --> 16:59.000
I really well thought, like I took the time to really write it out

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
and make it clear.

17:01.000 --> 17:05.000
It's just my face with a glowing backlight.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
Because you guys have no idea what to expect.

17:07.000 --> 17:11.000
Have you seen anything of Rick and Morty since you did your voice work in front of a microphone?

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
No, I haven't.

17:13.000 --> 17:18.000
I saw a couple of the animatics from early on, but I got...

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
That's what it's called, right?

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
Animatics?

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
The animatics.

17:21.000 --> 17:24.000
That's how you pronounce it in Canada.

17:24.000 --> 17:28.000
But I got the part because I could burp on cue, right, Justin?

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
You're very good.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
Very easy to direct.

17:32.000 --> 17:36.000
In fact, most of the time, no direction necessary at all.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
She shows up and...

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
All right, that's it. We're done.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
You did a great job.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
Is that because...

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
Cut it in and print, wrap.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
Is that because you weren't listening to her?

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
You were thinking about Elizabeth.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
Yes.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
Yes.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
That was good, Sarah.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
It's just I got bigger issues right now.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
I need to live underground.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
It's hard to multitask the direction of an actor

17:57.000 --> 18:00.000
while you're putting canned goods on a shelf

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
and shotgun shells.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
How easy...

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
You guys all laugh and mock me, but I swear to God,

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
when they fucking show up

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
and you guys are all going like,

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
fuck, you fucking with Sirius, right?

18:11.000 --> 18:14.000
When they show up, you said they've been here for a century.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
Yeah, they've been here for a century.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
Now you're warning us about them arriving.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
Well, here's the deal.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
I mean, they've been here for a century.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
Here's the thing.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
They cannot survive in our atmosphere, ladies and gentlemen.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
No, they have for a century by your own...

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
No, they can't...

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
I'm texting you.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
They can't live on the surface of Earth, okay?

18:30.000 --> 18:33.000
They can't just walk around and skate around like we do

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
and ride our bikes and shit.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
They can't do that.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
So what they've been doing is they've been interbreeding

18:38.000 --> 18:41.000
with our species for two reasons.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
One, because if they fucking, you know,

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
interbreed with our species,

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
then they're going to have a connection to humanity, right?

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
Right.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
So when they do finally show up and go,

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
oh, we've finally, after 100 years and some odd change,

18:51.000 --> 18:54.000
we've finally made a fucking version of hybrid us and you.

18:54.000 --> 18:58.000
That can totally live and hang out on Earth without any trouble.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
Then the fucking...

19:00.000 --> 19:03.000
I feel like a majority of us would then, at that point, go,

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
well, you should have been up front about it, but welcome.

19:06.000 --> 19:12.000
It's kind of our stock and trade is intermingling of DNA.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
That's what we've been up to this whole time.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
And then that's going to happen, like he said.

19:16.000 --> 19:20.000
And then they're going to be like, oh, and here, by the way...

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
Okay, sorry.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
No, you go ahead.

19:22.000 --> 19:25.000
Well, I was going to say, like, oh, hey, I fucking,

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
the people we made that are hybrids,

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
they're telepathically connected with us,

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
but, you know, they're related to you, so you can't hate them.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
And here we go.

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
And then all of a sudden, flash forward 100 years,

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
we're all now telepathically connected with them.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
And now they're monitoring our dreams.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
And now they're recording every thought we have,

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
because they're all fucking,

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
we all have their DNA pumping through our blood.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
And then they enslave us.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
Oh, no.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
And take over the resources of the planet Earth.

19:49.000 --> 19:53.000
This is getting so close to a racial purity argument.

19:53.000 --> 19:57.000
You just need to substitute two words in any of that.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
I'm trying to warn you from this.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
We as a human race need to stand up and fight

20:01.000 --> 20:04.000
these gray, almond-shaped-eyed alien people.

20:04.000 --> 20:07.000
Sometimes disguised as regular, almond-eyed people.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
Right.

20:08.000 --> 20:13.000
Like Tiger Woods or...

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
Sometimes they just look like Holly Berry,

20:16.000 --> 20:19.000
you know, kind of boxy.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
Listen, I'm not racist.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
I'm not racist, if that's what you're implying.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
But I were.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
If it go a little something like this.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
I'm gonna go out on a limb and say it.

20:27.000 --> 20:31.000
But I honestly, like, you've seen Alien Nation

20:31.000 --> 20:34.000
with Man of the Patek and James Conn, yeah.

20:34.000 --> 20:37.000
Like, you know, the idea, we're all prepared for that.

20:37.000 --> 20:40.000
The idea that based on our experience here on Earth,

20:40.000 --> 20:41.000
what tends to happen is...

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
Have you ever seen V?

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
Yeah.

20:44.000 --> 20:47.000
It's a lot more like V than Alien Nation, man.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
Because it's like, oh, they're cool.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
They're gonna fucking help us out.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
And then they're gonna be like, fucking...

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
Well, that's just because of the genre of TV.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
Shit, we're fucked now. We're fucked.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
Sometimes things are like N.Y.P.D. blues.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
Sometimes things are like Barney Miller.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
It just depends on people who are laughing, you know.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
It's a same show.

21:05.000 --> 21:08.000
The guy that showed his ass on N.Y.P. blues.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
Am I thinking...

21:09.000 --> 21:10.000
Dennis Franz.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
You guys all remember Dennis Franz showing his ass?

21:12.000 --> 21:15.000
Justin, how much of this is based on actual evidence,

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
and not just paranoia?

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
I'm gonna go ahead and tell you people in the audience

21:18.000 --> 21:21.000
that everything I just said is based on actual evidence.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
It's all 100% true.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
If you wanna go home and fucking, you know,

21:24.000 --> 21:27.000
pretend like all I said was a bunch of dumb nonsense,

21:27.000 --> 21:31.000
then, you know, I'd go ahead and sleep fucking soundly tonight

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
and for the next coming weeks.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
But I swear to God, when those aliens come,

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
and they start abducting your children

21:37.000 --> 21:40.000
and pregnanting your daughters with half-alien humans...

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
Oh, here we go. Here we go.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
...seeming and...

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
This is where I get edgy.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
And then they...

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
They're there at Thanksgiving.

21:47.000 --> 21:50.000
And they got engine blocks on your lawn.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
You're gonna be in real trouble then.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
They're putting weird shit in your DVR.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
It's like, you paid for that.

21:59.000 --> 22:03.000
You're gonna call back up this episode of Harmontown.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
You're gonna put it back in your computer,

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
and you're gonna turn it up and put your little earbuds in,

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
and you're gonna go, holy shit.

22:09.000 --> 22:13.000
That fucking guy who we all laughed at.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
He was right.

22:15.000 --> 22:18.000
And now the planet is void of war.

22:18.000 --> 22:21.000
It's peaceful. There's no more nuclear weapons.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
But I swear to God, these fucking gray,

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
armonite aliens, they're taking over.

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
And they're enslaving the human race.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
We're gonna be in servitude to them.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
You guys all like going to Blockbuster on the weekend

22:31.000 --> 22:32.000
and renting a movie?

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
It's shut down!

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
This week!

22:35.000 --> 22:36.000
Exactly!

22:36.000 --> 22:37.000
Literally, this week!

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
That's my point. That's what the aliens are gonna do.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
Oh, it's my point!

22:40.000 --> 22:43.000
The aliens are gonna shut it down.

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
The aliens are gonna shut it down.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
They can shut it down. The inevitable evolves.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
Who?

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
That's what they want you to think.

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
And cheese factory's next.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
Yeah.

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
And then...

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
I mean, do you remember when Twinkies went out of business?

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
Cheese factory.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
Who brought it back?

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
Probably the fucking descendants of those

22:59.000 --> 23:02.000
disgusting gray aliens with their armonides.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
And they're merging with humans.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
And they're huge cocks.

23:06.000 --> 23:09.000
Huge, massive cocks.

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
And also, they're really good at Monopoly.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
I mean, they will fucking...

23:14.000 --> 23:15.000
It's a new stereotype.

23:15.000 --> 23:18.000
That is a surefire sign.

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
Keep your eye on them.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.000
They're really good at Monopoly.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
They love Monopoly.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
There's some guy there, you don't know, or girl.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
And they have sort of omni-shaped eyes.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
And they're just...

23:26.000 --> 23:30.000
Justin, just describe another shape of eye.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
There's almond eyes versus...

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
You know, I hear a lot of stories about the lizard men

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
and all these other kind of aliens.

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
No, no.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
There's just one alien that is here,

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
that is present,

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
that is currently living on this sphere

23:42.000 --> 23:43.000
that we call Earth,

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
that's floating in the middle of space,

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
that we are a bunch of fucking idiots

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
bumping around into each other on.

23:49.000 --> 23:50.000
And those are the gray,

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
omni-shaped aliens.

23:52.000 --> 23:53.000
Wait.

23:53.000 --> 23:54.000
And they're fucking creepy.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
They're killing cattle.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
I mean, I could go on and on about these characters.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
Well, that's just basic butchering.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
Yeah, I mean...

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
Are you gonna put up for this?

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
We do that.

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
Can we barbeque them?

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
They're delicious.

24:05.000 --> 24:06.000
It's like protein beef.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
I think it's a little unfair to say.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
Sarah and Chuck,

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
you've been kind of quiet.

24:10.000 --> 24:13.000
Are you either an alien or...

24:13.000 --> 24:16.000
She does have beautiful, almond-shaped eyes.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.000
Easy, Justin.

24:17.000 --> 24:18.000
Easy, Justin.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
Have you ever seen a UFO?

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
You know, I saw Gravity this weekend,

24:22.000 --> 24:23.000
so I got...

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
Close enough.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
I have seen that.

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
Yeah, no, I was brought here

24:26.000 --> 24:29.000
because I am one of the obviously...

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
Well, let's have a dialogue

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
between these guys.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
Have you ever met one of us before?

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
No.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
They seem kind of cool.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
They're nice.

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
I'm super-duper scared,

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
and I wouldn't move to Alaska

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
if that's what you're asking me,

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
because that's where most of the abductions

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
in sexual or in transplants are taken.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
No, I didn't want you to move to Canada.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
Tell Sarah and Chuck everything you want to tell me.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
Look, Sarah and Chuck and the almond eyes

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
and ask her about it.

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
Sarah, have a dialogue.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
Will you tell these people that, like,

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
it's all good if they want to come here

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
and, you know, save us from ourselves

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
and, you know, stop all the pollution

24:59.000 --> 25:00.000
and get rid of all these nuclear weapons,

25:00.000 --> 25:04.000
but can they just totally not enslave us as a race

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
and then, like, kill us off

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
and, you know, make this crazy...

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
You know, we're just going to be lifting weights for them.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.000
We're going to be building pyramids for them.

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
But then what would be the point?

25:12.000 --> 25:15.000
Why would we come here?

25:15.000 --> 25:18.000
She's got a really good point.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
I mean, we would have just stayed on our planet then

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
where we actually do run everything.

25:22.000 --> 25:26.000
I can't believe you're winning me over with this, but...

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
I mean, it is a compelling argument.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
You know what, guys?

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
Honestly, the really bad stuff won't happen

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
till after we're all dead anyways.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.000
Right.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
And don't you think, Sarah, as a representative...

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
She's right. She's totally right.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
...of the aliens, wouldn't you think...

25:39.000 --> 25:42.000
Guys like me and Justin and John Oliver and Jeff

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
and most of the people here in the Harbin Town audience,

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
we'd be kind of like...

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
We'd have a pass, right?

25:48.000 --> 25:49.000
Yeah, yeah. Would you give us a pass?

25:49.000 --> 25:50.000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

25:50.000 --> 25:51.000
We'd get to hang out.

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
There's going to be, like, a...

25:53.000 --> 25:56.000
Can we get, like, a PlayStation 4 real quick and early

25:56.000 --> 25:59.000
and, like, the Xbox One with a subway black card?

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

26:01.000 --> 26:04.000
Five-dollar footlongs for life?

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
Is that a thing?

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
There's... I don't have a lot of skills, actually,

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
but the ones that I do have,

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
there will be rock band,

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
there will be limbo,

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
because that's one of the only things I can do.

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
I'm into that. I like that.

26:18.000 --> 26:21.000
I can write with my feet, so all of the writing will be

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
with my feet. That's how you can tell I'm an alien,

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
because I have finger toes. They're half the length of my feet.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
You know, I've got to tell you.

26:27.000 --> 26:30.000
I feel like Justin's paranoia was dispelled

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
simply by a woman looking him in the eyes.

26:34.000 --> 26:37.000
Which could be said about a lot of Internet...

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
From the almond eyes.

26:39.000 --> 26:42.000
Sometimes you just need Sarah Chalk to stare at you for a moment,

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
and you're stopping...

26:44.000 --> 26:47.000
Listen, if all the aliens, hybrid, human,

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
grays look like her, then fine.

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
What? That is literally...

26:51.000 --> 26:52.000
Literally!

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
I don't see the argument.

26:54.000 --> 26:57.000
Literally describing the Aryan super race.

26:57.000 --> 27:00.000
Literally, though, the nicest thing anyone's ever said to Justin.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
Yeah, that's how they're going to put it.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
If you send these things from a balcony and you're yelling,

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
it's a whole different thing.

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
No, but that's why I wanted to be Beth,

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
and come on your show, because now, you know,

27:10.000 --> 27:13.000
as a result, you'll all be welcome in the

27:13.000 --> 27:16.000
little Canadian

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
enclave

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
that we live in.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
That sounds nice. It sounds French.

27:22.000 --> 27:25.000
Look at how fucked we are as a human race.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
We're so...

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
Figgy-de-litty, figgy-de-li-fucked.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
Sarah, you got to look him in the eyes again.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
It's the only way to talk him off the edge.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
There you go. He's down.

27:35.000 --> 27:38.000
There should be a special window above the Internet

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
where there's just eye contact with a woman

27:40.000 --> 27:43.000
who would solve every argument.

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
There's only one thing we can do.

27:45.000 --> 27:48.000
It's the Canadian women, because the Canadians are very nice.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
There's only one thing we can do to fight the aliens

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
when they get here,

27:52.000 --> 27:56.000
and that's play this song on our iPads and iPhones.

28:09.000 --> 28:12.000
It should be said that none of this kettle one is being drunk

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
at this point.

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
These bottles are awesome.

28:16.000 --> 27:54.840
And the

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
aliens are coming.

28:18.000 --> 28:21.500
Has that been 45 minutes, are we?

28:21.500 --> 28:23.640
Not even close, we have another hour to go.

28:24.920 --> 28:25.760
That doesn't even make sense.

28:25.760 --> 28:27.260
We're at 8.39, Dan.

28:27.260 --> 28:28.600
We're at 8.39.

28:28.600 --> 28:30.700
Is it safe to pour this ice into my...

28:31.900 --> 28:32.740
I don't know.

28:32.740 --> 28:33.580
You want to say?

28:33.580 --> 28:34.420
Okay, well then, okay.

28:34.420 --> 28:35.260
That's not really ice.

28:35.260 --> 28:36.800
John Oliver, I have some questions for you.

28:36.800 --> 28:38.320
Yeah, yeah, let's talk to John.

28:38.320 --> 28:39.640
Hello?

28:39.640 --> 28:43.280
Hey, do all American people sound like cowboys to you?

28:43.280 --> 28:48.280
Even if they're not cowboys, even if they're from New York?

28:49.240 --> 28:50.560
There's a polite answer to that,

28:50.560 --> 28:51.900
and there's an honest answer.

28:54.400 --> 28:55.520
I don't know which one I want.

28:55.520 --> 29:00.040
Well, yeah, you have a cowboy-ish-esque.

29:00.040 --> 29:00.880
A twang.

29:00.880 --> 29:03.800
A twang, there's a hue, there's a verbal hue.

29:03.800 --> 29:05.680
Do you do an American accent?

29:05.680 --> 29:06.520
Oh yeah.

29:06.520 --> 29:10.680
John, John, how good are you at regional American accents?

29:10.680 --> 29:13.160
Let's start off, let's start easy,

29:13.160 --> 29:14.560
because you work in New York a lot.

29:14.560 --> 29:15.920
Let's do a good, like...

29:15.920 --> 29:17.500
Get the fuck out of here.

29:19.000 --> 29:20.520
Let me, let me get a coffee.

29:20.520 --> 29:21.360
Nobody tell him.

29:21.360 --> 29:23.360
Let me get a coffee.

29:23.360 --> 29:24.700
All right.

29:24.700 --> 29:25.800
Let me get a coffee.

29:25.800 --> 29:27.400
They are talking to you asshole.

29:27.400 --> 29:29.080
Hey, hey, Kuchansky.

29:29.080 --> 29:31.560
Hey, I'm working on a case.

29:31.560 --> 29:34.920
All right, now, let's move west.

29:34.920 --> 29:39.000
That's the most British accent I've ever heard about him.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
Hey, Kuchansky.

29:41.000 --> 29:42.560
Oh, I'm working on a case, John.

29:42.560 --> 29:44.400
So, Gavna, you can't sketch.

29:44.400 --> 29:46.400
The case of the missing team.

29:48.560 --> 29:50.560
Oh, Gavna.

29:50.560 --> 29:52.560
All right, now, let's go.

29:52.560 --> 29:53.800
In Python, when they do sketches,

29:53.800 --> 29:55.560
when they would talk like Americans,

29:55.560 --> 29:59.560
they had to like really aim towards Texas

29:59.560 --> 30:00.760
in order to really nail it.

30:00.760 --> 30:03.080
All right, so John, John, let's go to Chicago.

30:03.080 --> 30:05.040
Give me some Chicago.

30:05.040 --> 30:06.520
Yeah.

30:06.520 --> 30:08.000
How do they sound?

30:08.000 --> 30:09.320
Okay, all right, fair enough.

30:09.320 --> 30:11.680
I'll give you a thing.

30:11.680 --> 30:16.520
Oh, boy, the bears are really doing real good tonight.

30:16.520 --> 30:17.520
That was horrible, but...

30:17.520 --> 30:19.520
Oh, I sure love my cubs.

30:19.520 --> 30:21.520
Oh.

30:21.520 --> 30:23.520
That's good.

30:23.520 --> 30:25.520
You're just gonna go to Hampton.

30:25.520 --> 30:27.520
Maybe catch the Black Hawks.

30:27.520 --> 30:29.520
I like that.

30:29.520 --> 30:30.520
Hey, that's something interesting.

30:30.520 --> 30:32.520
It's the Google hockey game.

30:32.520 --> 30:34.520
Is that right?

30:34.520 --> 30:36.520
It's the best game you can name.

30:36.520 --> 30:38.520
That guy.

30:38.520 --> 30:40.520
That guy needs to be on a card.

30:40.520 --> 30:42.520
Where in Canada are you from?

30:42.520 --> 30:44.520
Vancouver.

30:44.520 --> 30:46.520
Vancouver, okay, so give me like Deep South America.

30:46.520 --> 30:48.520
Deep South?

30:48.520 --> 30:50.520
Yeah, like Southern Belle.

30:50.520 --> 30:52.520
Can I give you like Deep North Canada or something?

30:52.520 --> 30:54.520
No, no, no.

30:54.520 --> 30:56.520
Southern America.

30:56.520 --> 30:58.520
Southern America.

30:58.520 --> 31:00.520
That's already better than anything I did.

31:00.520 --> 31:02.520
That's perfect.

31:02.520 --> 31:04.520
All right, Dan, you do...

31:04.520 --> 31:06.520
Chinese.

31:06.520 --> 31:08.520
Chinese.

31:08.520 --> 31:10.520
You're like Ernest and like...

31:10.520 --> 31:12.520
Really like be a Chinese person.

31:12.520 --> 31:14.520
Like, don't make fun of them.

31:14.520 --> 31:16.520
Be one.

31:16.520 --> 31:18.520
Get out of the way of my tank.

31:20.520 --> 31:22.520
Actually, you know what?

31:22.520 --> 31:24.520
Why am I doing that guy?

31:24.520 --> 31:26.520
I'm gonna do the other guy.

31:26.520 --> 31:28.520
This tank is bad!

31:28.520 --> 31:30.520
I'm not even gonna put down my bag!

31:30.520 --> 31:32.520
We shouldn't be running over Americans.

31:32.520 --> 31:34.520
Don't try to steer the tank around me.

31:34.520 --> 31:36.520
I'm the tank guy.

31:36.520 --> 31:38.520
I'm the Tiananmen Square tank guy.

31:38.520 --> 31:40.520
Oh, oh, oh, Jesus Christ.

31:40.520 --> 31:42.520
I didn't even catch it.

31:42.520 --> 31:44.520
I tried to avoid the obvious fucking racism trap

31:44.520 --> 31:46.520
you guys set for me.

31:46.520 --> 31:48.520
Sorry about that.

31:48.520 --> 31:50.520
Whatever happened to Tank Man?

31:50.520 --> 31:52.520
Justin, Justin, the Philippines are in the news.

31:52.520 --> 31:54.520
Give me some Philippines.

31:54.520 --> 31:56.520
Here we go.

31:56.520 --> 31:58.520
All right, ladies and gentlemen, the Philippines.

31:58.520 --> 32:00.520
But I'm gonna do a guy who lived on a mountain

32:00.520 --> 32:02.520
and was totally

32:02.520 --> 32:04.520
super rich and didn't get affected

32:04.520 --> 32:06.520
by the thing that happened.

32:06.520 --> 32:08.520
All right.

32:08.520 --> 32:10.520
Oh, boy!

32:10.520 --> 32:12.520
Can I just jump in

32:12.520 --> 32:14.520
and give you

32:14.520 --> 32:16.520
an opportunity

32:16.520 --> 32:18.520
not to do this?

32:20.520 --> 32:22.520
Because

32:22.520 --> 32:24.520
you're facing a fork in the road

32:24.520 --> 32:26.520
and you've turned one way

32:26.520 --> 32:28.520
and I just want to touch you on the shoulder

32:28.520 --> 32:30.520
and know that I did all I could.

32:30.520 --> 32:32.520
I was gonna make him

32:32.520 --> 32:34.520
really, like, sympathetic.

32:34.520 --> 32:36.520
I don't know if you were gonna make him

32:36.520 --> 32:38.520
as sympathetic as you were trying.

32:38.520 --> 32:40.520
All right.

32:40.520 --> 32:42.520
Give me another race.

32:42.520 --> 32:44.520
Give me a race!

32:44.520 --> 32:46.520
Give me a race!

32:46.520 --> 32:48.520
Give me a race.

32:48.520 --> 32:50.520
Give me your best John Oliver impression.

32:50.520 --> 32:52.520
Me? Um, hello, governor.

32:52.520 --> 32:54.520
I'm John Oliver.

32:54.520 --> 32:56.520
Today we're going to be talking about

32:56.520 --> 32:58.520
a lot of stuff.

32:58.520 --> 33:00.520
It's very Australian-y, isn't it?

33:00.520 --> 33:02.520
I'm John Oliver and I'm the bonafide journalist.

33:02.520 --> 33:04.520
And I have glasses.

33:04.520 --> 33:06.520
There you go.

33:06.520 --> 33:08.520
The alien got it.

33:08.520 --> 33:10.520
You could never do John Oliver justice.

33:10.520 --> 33:12.520
I'm so much happier that you did that

33:12.520 --> 33:14.520
rather than your Philippine billionaire.

33:16.520 --> 33:18.520
Which, at the best of times,

33:18.520 --> 33:20.520
would have been misjudged.

33:20.520 --> 33:22.520
At what is technically the worst of times!

33:24.520 --> 33:26.520
You have no idea what

33:26.520 --> 33:28.520
a rich Philippine guy would have said.

33:28.520 --> 33:30.520
All right, Justin.

33:30.520 --> 33:32.520
Can I...

33:32.520 --> 33:34.520
Let's hear some Québécois.

33:34.520 --> 33:36.520
I grew up all of my classes in French.

33:36.520 --> 33:38.520
So, yes, all of my teachers were Québécois.

33:38.520 --> 33:40.520
Give me some...

33:44.520 --> 33:46.520
God.

33:46.520 --> 33:48.520
Oh, my God.

33:48.520 --> 33:50.520
Sarah and your clique, you got to shut your mouth

33:50.520 --> 33:52.520
because otherwise I'm going to give you time out

33:52.520 --> 33:54.520
for all of that one and that one and that one.

33:54.520 --> 33:56.520
In your class, would they, like, get their, like...

33:56.520 --> 33:58.520
Madame Maudet Thompson had the fork knife

33:58.520 --> 34:00.520
and spoon mobile and she would...

34:00.520 --> 34:02.520
If you were good in the class,

34:02.520 --> 34:04.520
you get to go and take the fork and you get to whack that one.

34:04.520 --> 34:06.520
But if not,

34:06.520 --> 34:08.520
you don't get to be the one to do that.

34:08.520 --> 34:10.520
She'd take the old big film canister

34:10.520 --> 34:12.520
and smack it on the desk, on your desk,

34:12.520 --> 34:14.520
and it scared the shit out of you.

34:16.520 --> 34:18.520
It's a beautiful language.

34:18.520 --> 34:20.520
It really is.

34:20.520 --> 34:22.520
Almost as beautiful as German,

34:22.520 --> 34:24.520
but it's a little bow.

34:24.520 --> 34:26.520
What?

34:26.520 --> 34:28.520
I'm not mad at all.

34:28.520 --> 34:30.520
I'm just telling you that she can't be late anymore.

34:30.520 --> 34:32.520
And I'd be like, well, you look mad.

34:32.520 --> 34:34.520
Hey, Sarah, how come all the Canadian...

34:34.520 --> 34:36.520
What do you call them? Provinces?

34:36.520 --> 34:38.520
Provinces we call them, yeah.

34:38.520 --> 34:40.520
How come the lines are so much straighter than in America?

34:40.520 --> 34:42.520
Isn't it older up there?

34:42.520 --> 34:44.520
Didn't we get there first?

34:44.520 --> 34:46.520
Yes, yes.

34:46.520 --> 34:48.520
It's a laser straight up there.

34:48.520 --> 34:50.520
It's much older.

34:50.520 --> 34:52.520
We are much...

34:52.520 --> 34:54.520
Why do they call them provinces?

34:54.520 --> 34:56.520
Also, damn that.

34:56.520 --> 34:58.520
In the middle of Canada,

34:58.520 --> 35:00.520
it doesn't matter because it's all flat.

35:00.520 --> 35:02.520
It's exactly the same.

35:02.520 --> 35:04.520
There's a lot of words that you may not...

35:04.520 --> 35:06.520
that don't translate.

35:06.520 --> 35:08.520
That I didn't...

35:08.520 --> 35:10.520
that I got down here

35:10.520 --> 35:12.520
like Garberator and Tooke.

35:12.520 --> 35:14.520
What?

35:14.520 --> 35:16.520
And...

35:16.520 --> 35:18.520
These are just your friends from high school.

35:18.520 --> 35:20.520
Yeah, I had a pretty awesome...

35:20.520 --> 35:22.520
Shit stick, forehead,

35:22.520 --> 35:24.520
fork, knuckle,

35:24.520 --> 35:26.520
dick, dick,

35:26.520 --> 35:28.520
dick, just dick.

35:28.520 --> 35:30.520
Just dick. Which is actually translates perfectly.

35:30.520 --> 35:32.520
Gloomy.

35:32.520 --> 35:34.520
Garberator.

35:34.520 --> 35:36.520
Garberator, that's a garbage disposal.

35:36.520 --> 35:38.520
And a parkade is a parking structure.

35:38.520 --> 35:40.520
What is the equivalent of moving to Canada tomorrow?

35:40.520 --> 35:42.520
Do you have Alderman or Ambsbudsman?

35:42.520 --> 35:44.520
What is the lowest level

35:44.520 --> 35:46.520
of political representative in Canada?

35:46.520 --> 35:48.520
You have Ambsbudsman,

35:48.520 --> 35:50.520
and then you have all the way up to...

35:50.520 --> 35:52.520
Schmuntzman's been sent in.

35:52.520 --> 35:54.520
Schmuntzman, Schmuntzman.

35:54.520 --> 35:56.520
All the way up to Mr. Ford.

35:56.520 --> 35:58.520
All the way up to the Canadian president.

35:58.520 --> 36:00.520
All the way up to...

36:00.520 --> 36:02.520
Shrakshmomama.

36:02.520 --> 36:04.520
Everything's a one-for-one analog up there.

36:04.520 --> 36:06.520
Sarah.

36:06.520 --> 36:08.520
I know it's not America's job to button...

36:08.520 --> 36:10.520
We make it our job to button to other people's politics,

36:10.520 --> 36:12.520
but how do you feel about Toronto's mayor current?

36:12.520 --> 36:14.520
I mean, he has got a lot

36:14.520 --> 36:16.520
to eat at home.

36:16.520 --> 36:18.520
Oh, yeah.

36:18.520 --> 36:20.520
That was my favorite one, I think.

36:20.520 --> 36:22.520
Oh, yeah, the eating pussy line is fucking good.

36:22.520 --> 36:24.520
Wait, what's happening with Toronto's mayor?

36:24.520 --> 36:26.520
He's smoking some crack.

36:26.520 --> 36:28.520
He drives drawings.

36:28.520 --> 36:30.520
He urinates in a schoolyard.

36:30.520 --> 36:32.520
He poosmoos in the toilet.

36:32.520 --> 36:34.520
This must be so exciting for your three

36:34.520 --> 36:36.520
prime-time Canadian talk show hosts.

36:36.520 --> 36:38.520
Or late-night...

36:38.520 --> 36:40.520
Goddamn it, I fucked up a joke.

36:40.520 --> 36:42.520
It's okay.

36:42.520 --> 36:44.520
I don't want one tonight.

36:44.520 --> 36:46.520
Don't let it...

36:46.520 --> 36:48.520
You guys have a Marion Berry, that's what I'm hearing.

36:48.520 --> 36:50.520
Yeah.

36:50.520 --> 36:52.520
Your Toronto mayor is...

36:52.520 --> 36:54.520
Yeah, he's in trouble. Fuck.

36:54.520 --> 36:56.520
Yeah, it's nice. It lowers the bar

36:56.520 --> 36:58.520
for the rest of us Canadians to speak in public.

36:58.520 --> 37:00.520
Like, tonight, I just don't have to...

37:00.520 --> 37:02.520
You don't have to smoke crack?

37:02.520 --> 37:04.520
I just have to make sure I don't pee on anybody.

37:04.520 --> 37:06.520
And I'm good.

37:06.520 --> 37:08.520
Public speaking's no problem.

37:08.520 --> 37:10.520
You know what's funny about all this

37:10.520 --> 37:12.520
is the way aliens show up.

37:12.520 --> 37:14.520
Like, they don't give a fuck.

37:14.520 --> 37:16.520
They're gonna, like, shit in your mouths.

37:16.520 --> 37:18.520
Jesus Christ.

37:18.520 --> 37:20.520
They're gonna shit in your mouths.

37:20.520 --> 37:22.520
They're gonna shit in our mouths?

37:22.520 --> 37:24.520
Yeah, yeah.

37:24.520 --> 37:26.520
And you're all laughing now,

37:26.520 --> 37:28.520
but when you're strapped down

37:28.520 --> 37:30.520
and your eyes are peeled open

37:30.520 --> 37:32.520
and they're bent over and shitting in your mouth...

37:32.520 --> 37:34.520
Can you just honestly, like...

37:34.520 --> 37:36.520
I think even the great aliens

37:36.520 --> 37:38.520
with their different moral code

37:38.520 --> 37:40.520
Justin, how old are you?

37:40.520 --> 37:42.520
Me? Yeah.

37:42.520 --> 37:44.520
I'm 33 years old.

37:44.520 --> 37:46.520
And every year I get closer to the inevitable death

37:46.520 --> 37:48.520
that we all will face.

37:48.520 --> 37:50.520
I want you all to fucking think about that tonight

37:50.520 --> 37:52.520
when you're going to sleep. We're all gonna die.

37:52.520 --> 37:54.520
There's nothing you can do about it.

37:54.520 --> 37:56.520
And what the fuck happens after that?

37:56.520 --> 37:58.520
Go ahead. What was your question?

37:58.520 --> 38:00.520
My question was this...

38:00.520 --> 38:02.520
Anyway, sleep well, children.

38:02.520 --> 38:04.520
My question was that...

38:04.520 --> 38:06.520
I've heard it said that schizophrenia

38:06.520 --> 38:08.520
really, or like around like late 30s and 40 years old.

38:08.520 --> 38:10.520
I think I might be out of the window.

38:10.520 --> 38:12.520
I think I'm out of the window.

38:12.520 --> 38:14.520
No, no, because I think you might be

38:14.520 --> 38:16.520
like right in prime time schizophrenia.

38:16.520 --> 38:18.520
Like maybe you just lost your fucking mind.

38:18.520 --> 38:20.520
I think I'm totally in the window. Huh?

38:20.520 --> 38:22.520
I'll tell you what, if this turns out to be

38:22.520 --> 38:24.520
that I'm actually in a padded cell in a straight jacket

38:24.520 --> 38:26.520
and I'm just talking to myself right now,

38:26.520 --> 38:28.520
then I'm totally schizophrenic.

38:28.520 --> 38:30.520
But if I'm really in front of a bunch of people

38:30.520 --> 38:32.520
with lights on me and Dan Harmon's

38:32.520 --> 38:34.520
are there and John Oliver and Sarah Chuck

38:34.520 --> 38:36.520
I can't be schizophrenic if that's the case.

38:36.520 --> 38:38.520
I'm not saying... I'm not here.

38:40.520 --> 38:42.520
Holy... John Oliver died four years ago.

38:44.520 --> 38:46.520
Flannigan killed him.

38:46.520 --> 38:48.520
Elvis Presley's right over there, right?

38:48.520 --> 38:50.520
I mean, right?

38:50.520 --> 38:52.520
No, you're psychotic

38:52.520 --> 38:54.520
if you're in a different place.

38:54.520 --> 38:56.520
If you're schizophrenic, you could just think that

38:56.520 --> 38:58.520
that's just making extra connections.

38:58.520 --> 39:00.520
I hear that if you're schizophrenic,

39:00.520 --> 39:02.520
you hear audible hallucinations

39:02.520 --> 39:04.520
and then you want to kill people.

39:04.520 --> 39:06.520
There was this kid that used to go to the card shop

39:06.520 --> 39:08.520
that I used to go buy my comics at

39:08.520 --> 39:10.520
and he was always there playing magic

39:10.520 --> 39:12.520
and Pokemon cards with people

39:12.520 --> 39:14.520
and then one week he just wasn't there

39:14.520 --> 39:16.520
and the shop was kind of...

39:16.520 --> 39:18.520
everyone was real quiet and it was sort of depressing

39:18.520 --> 39:20.520
and I asked the guy as I was checking out...

39:20.520 --> 39:22.520
The exits are two to the left.

39:22.520 --> 39:24.520
I asked the guy...

39:24.520 --> 39:26.520
I said, hey, where's Jimmy at?

39:26.520 --> 39:28.520
He's usually here every week

39:28.520 --> 39:30.520
when I pull in and buy my comics

39:30.520 --> 39:32.520
and he's like, yeah, he was Skitzo

39:32.520 --> 39:34.520
and he killed his fucking grandmother

39:34.520 --> 39:36.520
that he lived with.

39:36.520 --> 39:38.520
He fucking gouged her eyeballs out

39:38.520 --> 39:40.520
because she made him stop taking his meds.

39:40.520 --> 39:42.520
That's so weird because I was convinced

39:42.520 --> 39:44.520
that story was gonna end well.

39:44.520 --> 39:46.520
It's a true story.

39:46.520 --> 39:48.520
Let me tell you about it.

39:48.520 --> 39:50.520
It's a true story.

39:50.520 --> 39:52.520
That's what happened.

39:52.520 --> 39:54.520
And I'll tell you the other thing.

39:54.520 --> 39:56.520
I still buy my comics.

39:56.520 --> 39:58.520
This is how I reacted to hearing that news.

39:58.520 --> 40:00.520
I swear to God this is true.

40:00.520 --> 40:02.520
I'll take an extra issue of Watchmen.

40:02.520 --> 40:04.520
Kind of.

40:04.520 --> 40:06.520
I was like, oh, wow, that's...

40:06.520 --> 40:08.520
In that case. See ya.

40:08.520 --> 40:10.520
That's what I did. I said, all right, well...

40:10.520 --> 40:12.520
I will give Amazing Spider-Man another try.

40:12.520 --> 40:14.520
Spider-Man 2032.

40:14.520 --> 40:16.520
Oh, he's amazing now?

40:16.520 --> 40:18.520
$3, please.

40:18.520 --> 40:20.520
Oh, my God.

40:20.520 --> 40:22.520
The girl he's fucking's got dark brown hair.

40:22.520 --> 40:24.520
Oh, sold.

40:24.520 --> 40:26.520
I hated redheads.

40:26.520 --> 40:28.520
I can't wait to see this fucking cartoon.

40:28.520 --> 40:30.520
Yeah, are we... are we... are you guys ready?

40:30.520 --> 40:32.520
Have we run up the goddamn meter?

40:32.520 --> 40:34.520
Have we...

40:34.520 --> 40:36.520
Have we driven this taxi cab

40:36.520 --> 40:38.520
around the block? Perfect segue.

40:38.520 --> 40:40.520
Anyway, I think you have a clip.

40:40.520 --> 40:42.520
Are you guys ready to see the world premiere

40:42.520 --> 40:44.520
issue

40:44.520 --> 40:46.520
of Rick and Morty?

40:46.520 --> 40:48.520
From the mind of this man, which is now gonna see

40:48.520 --> 40:50.520
disappointingly conventional.

40:52.520 --> 40:54.520
Let's thank Sarah Chuck, John Oliver,

40:54.520 --> 40:56.520
and Justin Ryland for coming up.

41:00.520 --> 41:02.520
Enjoy. Enjoy two episodes

41:02.520 --> 41:04.520
of Rick and Morty. If you're listening

41:04.520 --> 41:06.520
in the podcast world, you're just

41:06.520 --> 41:08.520
gonna have to tune into Adult Swim

41:08.520 --> 41:10.520
on December something. December 2nd.

41:10.520 --> 41:12.520
December 2nd, and then

41:12.520 --> 41:14.520
like, like, like seven days after that,

41:14.520 --> 41:16.520
you know, like, I don't know.

41:16.520 --> 41:18.520
And hey, as long as there's at least 500 people

41:18.520 --> 41:20.520
listening, community premieres

41:20.520 --> 41:22.520
January 2nd.

41:22.520 --> 41:24.520
February 2nd.

41:24.520 --> 41:26.520
Isn't it February? No, it's January.

41:26.520 --> 41:28.520
Oh, it is? Oh, shit. I'm sorry. I fucked up.

41:28.520 --> 41:30.520
I may have just jumbled our numbers.

41:30.520 --> 41:32.520
Sit down, everybody. The screening

41:32.520 --> 41:34.520
of Rick and Morty is coming right up.

41:34.520 --> 41:36.520
Are we... are we... are we...

41:36.520 --> 41:38.520
Sit down, Justin. You're done.

41:38.520 --> 41:40.520
Harmon's gonna make himself a drink.

41:40.520 --> 41:42.520
Do it.

41:42.520 --> 41:44.520
All right.

41:44.520 --> 41:54.520
Well, that's everybody. The premiere is coming right up.
