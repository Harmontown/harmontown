Yeah.\n\n01:58.000 --> 01:59.000\nI don't know.\n\n01:59.000 --> 02:00.000\nLet's just call it fucking nine.\n\n02:00.000 --> 02:03.000\nWe're going to be done with Harmontown, then we get into the next stuff.\n\n02:03.000 --> 02:04.000\nI don't know.\n\n02:04.000 --> 02:05.000\nAlright.\n\n02:05.000 --> 02:06.000\nI've never been on stage at Largo.\n\n02:06.000 --> 02:11.000\nIf something really funny happens in five seconds, we're going to end the show.\n\n02:11.000 --> 02:13.000\nWell, I'll go to the Roger Room and get fucked up.\n\n02:13.000 --> 02:14.000\nI'm Fernette Broncker.\n\n02:14.000 --> 02:16.000\nLargo has a rich history.\n\n02:16.000 --> 02:18.000\nThe legendary Flanagan runs this place.\n\n02:18.000 --> 02:19.000\nThe lovely Flanagan.\n\n02:19.000 --> 02:21.000\nThank you, Flanagan, for having us.\n\n02:21.000 --> 02:23.000\nFlanny to his friends.\n\n02:23.000 --> 02:26.000\nHe got Jack Black hooked on heroin here.\n\n02:26.000 --> 02:27.000\nYeah.\n\n02:27.000 --> 02:29.000\nHe killed Grand Parsons.\n\n02:29.000 --> 02:30.000\nHe killed...\n\n02:30.000 --> 02:32.000\nA lot of people don't know that.\n\n02:32.000 --> 02:34.000\nHe actually murdered Grand Parsons.\n\n02:34.000 --> 02:40.000\nAndy Kindler's balls were hit with a hammer by...\n\n02:40.000 --> 02:41.000\nAndy did.\n\n02:41.000 --> 02:43.000\n...Amy Mann over in the corner.\n\n02:43.000 --> 02:44.000\nI don't know.\n\n02:44.000 --> 02:45.000\nLargo people.\n\n02:45.000 --> 02:47.000\nIt's a rich, rich tapestry of history.\n\n02:47.000 --> 02:49.000\nLargo people.\n\n02:49.000 --> 02:54.000\nWe're honored to be here and we're going to show you some Rick and Morty stuff later.\n\n02:54.000 --> 02:56.000\nAlright, Sam.\n\n02:56.000 --> 02:58.000\nI'm worried.\n\n02:58.000 --> 03:04.000\nI'm worried that because you're seated with a giant flagon of vodka right now that you\n\n03:04.000 --> 03:08.000\nwon't be as dynamic as you normally are at Meltdown Comics when you stand up and treat\n\n03:08.000 --> 03:09.000\nthe people.\n\n03:09.000 --> 03:10.000\nNo, it's fine.\n\n03:10.000 --> 03:12.000\nWhat good does expressing the worry do?\n\n03:12.000 --> 03:13.000\nWhat are you going to...\n\n03:13.000 --> 03:15.000\nIs that like a hot air balloon?\n\n03:15.000 --> 03:16.000\nNo.\n\n03:16.000 --> 03:17.000\nIt's like the fire will make me go higher?\n\n03:17.000 --> 03:21.000\nIt's a challenge, I'm saying, if you're going to be seated, fucking bring the thunder.\n\n03:21.000 --> 03:22.000\nI'm bringing it.\n\n03:22.000 --> 03:23.000\nName a topic.\n\n03:23.000 --> 03:24.000\nI heard socks.\n\n03:24.000 --> 03:26.000\nI got these socks.\n\n03:26.000 --> 03:27.000\nThey don't match.\n\n03:27.000 --> 03:29.000\nOkay, what else?\n\n03:29.000 --> 03:31.000\nI heard firemen.\n\n03:31.000 --> 03:35.000\nWhat takes them so long?\n\n03:35.000 --> 03:36.000\nRacism.\n\n03:36.000 --> 03:37.000\nRacism?\n\n03:37.000 --> 03:38.000\nWhat's with black people?\n\n03:38.000 --> 03:40.000\nWhy are they so bad?\n\n03:40.000 --> 03:41.000\nShit.\n\n03:41.000 --> 03:45.000\nSee, if you were standing, you would have been more racist.\n\n03:45.000 --> 03:50.000\nMy intention was to come down against racism, not a race.\n\n03:50.000 --> 03:53.000\nSorry, black people.\n\n03:53.000 --> 03:54.000\nAgain.\n\n03:54.000 --> 03:58.000\nAll right, so I think we need to bring up our first guest right away.\n\n03:58.000 --> 04:00.000\nWe have a fucking surfeit of celebrity guests.\n\n04:00.000 --> 04:01.000\nThis is too much to do.\n\n04:01.000 --> 04:02.000\nThere's too much to do.\n\n04:02.000 --> 04:04.000\nThere's no time to fucking dick about.\n\n04:04.000 --> 04:06.000\nWhat have you been up to?\n\n04:06.000 --> 04:10.000\nI've gained a lot of weight.\n\n04:10.000 --> 04:17.000\nThere's two thresholds I crossed when I gained a certain amount of weight in an ascending\n\n04:17.000 --> 04:20.000\norder of disturbance.\n\n04:20.000 --> 04:26.000\nThe first is back pain, because I'm walking for two.\n\n04:26.000 --> 04:31.000\nActually, just notice at a certain point that my back hurts, and then I think back\n\n04:31.000 --> 04:32.000\nand go, oh, was I carrying something?\n\n04:32.000 --> 04:35.000\nYes, I was, but not with my arms.\n\n04:35.000 --> 04:36.000\nIt was an extra.\n\n04:36.000 --> 04:40.000\nThe second thing is a little thing called sleep apnea for those of you in the audience\n\n04:40.000 --> 04:41.000\nwho are familiar with this.\n\n04:41.000 --> 04:44.000\nThis is when you get so fat that when you're asleep.\n\n04:44.000 --> 04:45.000\nHow fat are you?\n\n04:45.000 --> 04:52.000\nWhen you're asleep, sometimes your body forgets you're supposed to be alive.\n\n04:52.000 --> 04:53.000\nThat's sleep apnea.\n\n04:53.000 --> 04:56.000\nYour body forgets to breathe.\n\n04:56.000 --> 05:01.000\nYou wake up going, grrr, because you're that fat.\n\n05:01.000 --> 05:03.000\nHave you been fatter than right now?\n\n05:03.000 --> 05:05.000\nHave you been fatter?\n\n05:05.000 --> 05:09.000\nAsk an objective observer.\n\n05:09.000 --> 05:13.000\nIs Pluto fatter than Mercury?\n\n05:13.000 --> 05:19.000\nYou're not going to get a definitive answer from anyone other than Earth.\n\n05:19.000 --> 05:21.000\nHave you weighed more than you currently weigh?\n\n05:21.000 --> 05:22.000\nI don't weigh myself.\n\n05:22.000 --> 05:23.000\nI don't truck with that.\n\n05:23.000 --> 05:28.000\nHave you looked in the mirror and been less or more disappointed than you are right now?\n\n05:28.000 --> 05:32.000\nMirrors play tricks.\n\n05:32.000 --> 05:34.000\nFunhouse mirrors play tricks.\n\n05:34.000 --> 05:39.000\nI saw some Communicon photos that were a bummer.\n\n05:39.000 --> 05:46.000\nI was like, is that Dan Aykroyd at the Madame Tussaud museum?\n\n05:46.000 --> 05:50.000\nIs that a planet of hair?\n\n05:50.000 --> 05:56.000\nI do a bit in the community writer's room where I have two characters named Sam and Diane\n\n05:56.000 --> 05:59.000\nthat are on opposite sides of my gut.\n\n05:59.000 --> 06:00.000\nWhere are you?\n\n06:00.000 --> 06:01.000\nSam!\n\n06:01.000 --> 06:02.000\nDiane, I can't find you.\n\n06:02.000 --> 06:07.000\nOkay, let's bring out our first guest.\n\n06:07.000 --> 06:09.000\nHe's my partner.\n\n06:09.000 --> 06:14.000\nThis is a cleverly disguised advertisement for our show Rick and Morty.\n\n06:14.000 --> 06:23.000\nOur first guest is co-creator of Rick and Morty, Justin Roiland.\n\n06:23.000 --> 06:24.000\nHi, buddy.\n\n06:24.000 --> 06:25.000\nHey, how are you?\n\n06:25.000 --> 06:26.000\nHow are you?\n\n06:26.000 --> 06:29.000\nYou know, I just want to say I think you look as svelte as ever.\n\n06:29.000 --> 06:30.000\nThanks, buddy.\n\n06:30.000 --> 06:33.000\nI don't know about all this talk about being overweight.\n\n06:33.000 --> 06:34.000\nYou look beautiful.\n\n06:34.000 --> 06:35.000\nThanks, Justin.\n\n06:35.000 --> 06:39.000\nAnd after the show, I got a bag of Doritos waiting for you with your name on it.\n\n06:39.000 --> 06:41.000\nOh, he's like the Colonel and I'm Elvis.\n\n06:41.000 --> 06:42.000\nHe's hooking me.\n\n06:42.000 --> 06:43.000\nI'm like an enably.\n\n06:43.000 --> 06:45.000\nHe keeps me going with riboflavin.\n\n06:45.000 --> 06:48.000\nHe's like Flanagan to Graham Parsons.\n\n06:48.000 --> 06:49.000\nYeah.\n\n06:49.000 --> 06:50.000\nYeah.\n\n06:50.000 --> 06:52.000\nMurdered Graham Parsons, you guys.\n\n06:52.000 --> 06:54.000\nHey, listen, it's an honor to be here.\n\n06:54.000 --> 06:59.000\nAnd boy, oh boy, do we have something really special in store for all of you tonight.\n\n06:59.000 --> 07:02.000\nJustin has a thing he was talking about backstage.\n\n07:02.000 --> 07:08.000\nNow, you're a guy who on any given day, you'll talk about Skull Island with the gold and the reserves and the...\n\n07:08.000 --> 07:13.000\nTalk about the fucking Woodrow Wilson, the Federal Reserve, fucking Jekyll Island.\n\n07:13.000 --> 07:15.000\nYou're sort of a doomsday prepper.\n\n07:15.000 --> 07:17.000\nYou're kind of a...\n\n07:17.000 --> 07:18.000\nI mean, listen, a show of hands.\n\n07:18.000 --> 07:20.000\nI can't see you because the lights are bright.\n\n07:20.000 --> 07:21.000\nBut a show of hands.\n\n07:21.000 --> 07:26.000\nHow many people think this country is just going right down into the poopy hole?\n\n07:26.000 --> 07:27.000\nCan I get a show of hands?\n\n07:27.000 --> 07:28.000\nWell, nobody's going to.\n\n07:28.000 --> 07:29.000\nAnybody?\n\n07:29.000 --> 07:30.000\nWho's going to...\n\n07:30.000 --> 07:31.000\nYou think Captain America's here?\n\n07:31.000 --> 07:32.000\nEveryone's raising their hands.\n\n07:32.000 --> 07:35.000\nLike one guy is going to be like two sparklers and...\n\n07:35.000 --> 07:39.000\nNo one profits from saying that America's doing great.\n\n07:39.000 --> 07:41.000\nThat was the 40s.\n\n07:41.000 --> 07:42.000\nBut you know...\n\n07:42.000 --> 07:46.000\nThe only way to earn a dollar right now is to say we're fucked.\n\n07:46.000 --> 07:47.000\nThat's the only thing that anyone's buying.\n\n07:47.000 --> 07:49.000\nWe're really fucked, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n07:49.000 --> 07:53.000\nAnd if you just put a dollar on the edge of the stage there...\n\n07:53.000 --> 07:59.000\nBut you, specifically, you think that we're fucked for a really specific Art Bell kind of reason.\n\n07:59.000 --> 08:00.000\nWell, here's the thing.\n\n08:00.000 --> 08:03.000\nWe do know that the Earth is being polluted.\n\n08:03.000 --> 08:10.000\nWe do know that we, as a human race, we've crossed a threshold in technology that is causing just chaos.\n\n08:10.000 --> 08:13.000\nI mean, we're all glued to these fucking little tablet screens and everything.\n\n08:13.000 --> 08:16.000\nAnd we probably think, hey, this is good for us.\n\n08:16.000 --> 08:17.000\nThis is great and wonderful.\n\n08:17.000 --> 08:18.000\nSeems healthy.\n\n08:18.000 --> 08:27.000\nBut what you don't realize is that for the last century, the gray almond-eyed aliens have been living among us.\n\n08:27.000 --> 08:28.000\nI'm not trying to be funny.\n\n08:28.000 --> 08:30.000\nI'm not trying to fucking be a...\n\n08:30.000 --> 08:32.000\nYou know, I'm dead serious.\n\n08:32.000 --> 08:34.000\nI believe this to be true.\n\n08:34.000 --> 08:36.000\nAnd I know that they've been here.\n\n08:36.000 --> 08:38.000\nYou're still being funny.\n\n08:38.000 --> 08:39.000\nLook, you can laugh.\n\n08:39.000 --> 08:42.000\nYou can laugh with me or at me.\n\n08:42.000 --> 08:43.000\nBut you have to laugh.\n\n08:43.000 --> 08:47.000\nBut I'd prefer you laugh at me if you don't believe it.\n\n08:47.000 --> 08:49.000\nBecause it's true.\n\n08:49.000 --> 08:55.000\nAnd they are here to enslave the human race and take the planet Earth from us.\n\n08:55.000 --> 08:59.000\nAnd they're going to come here and they're going to say, oh, we want to fix it all for you.\n\n08:59.000 --> 09:00.000\nYou're polluting it.\n\n09:00.000 --> 09:01.000\nAnd you're doing this and that and the other thing.\n\n09:01.000 --> 09:03.000\nBut guess what, ladies and gentlemen?\n\n09:03.000 --> 09:06.000\nWe're the gray-eyed almond-shaped eye aliens.\n\n09:06.000 --> 09:07.000\nAnd we're here.\n\n09:07.000 --> 09:10.000\nAnd we're going to go ahead and fix it all for you.\n\n09:10.000 --> 09:12.000\nWe're going to get rid of the nuclear bombs.\n\n09:12.000 --> 09:16.000\nWe're going to get rid of all the shit China's doing and polluting the waters and all that shit.\n\n09:16.000 --> 09:19.000\nSo they're going to come to Earth and they're going to say, we're here to help you with China.\n\n09:19.000 --> 09:20.000\nExactly.\n\n09:20.000 --> 09:21.000\nBut.\n\n09:21.000 --> 09:22.000\nBut.\n\n09:22.000 --> 09:26.000\nAnd China's going to go, you have almond eyes.\n\n09:26.000 --> 09:28.000\nHow can you do this?\n\n09:28.000 --> 09:29.000\nSame team.\n\n09:29.000 --> 09:34.000\nYour eyes are shaped like beautiful almonds.\n\n09:34.000 --> 09:37.000\nAnd the almond farmers especially are going to be upset about this.\n\n09:37.000 --> 09:42.000\nBut the fact remains, don't trust these fucking aliens.\n\n09:42.000 --> 09:49.000\nThey're coming to enslave us, to take over the planet and to harvest the resources of Earth.\n\n09:49.000 --> 09:51.000\nAnd questions, please.\n\n09:51.000 --> 09:52.000\nShould we introduce them?\n\n09:52.000 --> 09:55.000\nOne question before we bring out our panel of questionnaires.\n\n09:55.000 --> 09:56.000\nOur esteemed panel.\n\n09:56.000 --> 09:57.000\nThose resources are in order.\n\n09:57.000 --> 09:58.000\nYes.\n\n09:58.000 --> 09:59.000\nWater.\n\n09:59.000 --> 10:00.000\nGold.\n\n10:00.000 --> 10:01.000\nI don't know.\n\n10:01.000 --> 10:02.000\nAll right.\n\n10:02.000 --> 10:03.000\nYou know what?\n\n10:03.000 --> 10:04.000\nTell them water, dirt.\n\n10:04.000 --> 10:05.000\nI mean, you know.\n\n10:05.000 --> 10:07.000\nWe've got a lot of dirt here.\n\n10:07.000 --> 10:08.000\nLet's bring out some professional.\n\n10:08.000 --> 10:09.000\nOxygen.\n\n10:09.000 --> 10:12.000\nSo people who plan.\n\n10:12.000 --> 10:13.000\nIsn't it hydrogen they want?\n\n10:13.000 --> 10:14.000\nThat makes fuel.\n\n10:14.000 --> 10:15.000\nListen, man.\n\n10:15.000 --> 10:16.000\nThis planet is very rare.\n\n10:16.000 --> 10:19.000\nI mean, ask your local scientist at the scientist center.\n\n10:19.000 --> 10:21.000\nHow many other Earths have they found yet?\n\n10:21.000 --> 10:22.000\nThat fit the description.\n\n10:22.000 --> 10:25.000\nHow many scientist centers have you found?\n\n10:25.000 --> 10:26.000\nNot.\n\n10:26.000 --> 10:27.000\nWell, there is.\n\n10:27.000 --> 10:28.000\nYou're right.\n\n10:28.000 --> 10:30.000\nMy favorite thing is that you brought out your phone because when you were going to\n\n10:30.000 --> 10:34.000\nwarn people about the alien invasion, there's some shit you might forget.\n\n10:34.000 --> 10:36.000\nIt's not that important yet.\n\n10:36.000 --> 10:37.000\nSilent green is.\n\n10:37.000 --> 10:39.000\nHold on a second.\n\n10:39.000 --> 10:40.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n10:40.000 --> 10:41.000\nSilent green is people.\n\n10:41.000 --> 10:42.000\nI had to come prepared.\n\n10:42.000 --> 10:44.000\nI had to come prepared.\n\n10:44.000 --> 10:47.000\nI am doing this for you.\n\n10:47.000 --> 10:52.000\nI had to make sure I didn't forget any of the most important things that have to do with\n\n10:52.000 --> 10:54.000\nmy message that I'm delivering to you people.\n\n10:54.000 --> 10:56.000\nAnd I hope you spread it after tonight.\n\n10:56.000 --> 11:00.000\nWell, I have a surprise for you because we have a bona fide global level journalist here\n\n11:00.000 --> 11:03.000\nfrom the Daily Show, Mr. John Oliver.\n\n11:03.000 --> 11:15.000\nHe's a professional.\n\n11:15.000 --> 11:18.000\nHe's a professional.\n\n11:18.000 --> 11:20.000\nWow.\n\n11:20.000 --> 11:22.000\nWow.\n\n11:22.000 --> 11:25.000\nYou know how to sell your show.\n\n11:25.000 --> 11:30.000\nYou have to get on the Tonight Show before Leno leaves to promote Rick and Morty.\n\n11:30.000 --> 11:32.000\nI don't want to talk about it, Jay.\n\n11:32.000 --> 11:35.000\nWe're all working for aliens.\n\n11:35.000 --> 11:37.000\nYou're all living a lie.\n\n11:37.000 --> 11:39.000\nYeah, I'll stay after the break.\n\n11:39.000 --> 11:43.000\nSure, yeah.\n\n11:43.000 --> 11:45.000\nJohn, do you have any questions?\n\n11:45.000 --> 11:47.000\nI have so many questions.\n\n11:47.000 --> 11:48.000\nGo ahead, try.\n\n11:48.000 --> 11:54.000\nBut there's not so much about aliens as the source of which this information is coming from.\n\n11:54.000 --> 11:57.000\nWhat's happening in your head?\n\n11:57.000 --> 11:59.000\nThe truth is happening in my head.\n\n11:59.000 --> 12:04.000\nYou sound like Rand Paul's more extreme brother.\n\n12:04.000 --> 12:08.000\nListen, I have a direct connection to the others.\n\n12:08.000 --> 12:14.000\nThey are a very far off race that is sending me telepathic messages\n\n12:14.000 --> 12:18.000\nand letting me know that I must communicate to humanity.\n\n12:18.000 --> 12:20.000\nWell, then you're the threat.\n\n12:20.000 --> 12:21.000\nWhat?\n\n12:21.000 --> 12:23.000\nJust because someone has all my eyes.\n\n12:23.000 --> 12:27.000\nI'm more scared of the guy with a mental connection to another.\n\n12:27.000 --> 12:31.000\nYou know, you want to be scared of people with mental connections, then...\n\n12:31.000 --> 12:33.000\nI can't wait to hear where this sentence is going.\n\n12:33.000 --> 12:35.000\nI cannot wait.\n\n12:35.000 --> 12:38.000\nI just want to enjoy the moment of that sentence hanging in the air.\n\n12:38.000 --> 12:42.000\nNow finish it.\n\n12:42.000 --> 12:45.000\nI really, I don't have any...\n\n12:45.000 --> 12:47.000\nI'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.\n\n12:47.000 --> 12:49.000\nAsk me a question, go ahead.\n\n12:49.000 --> 12:53.000\nJustin, what's your big fear when the aliens come?\n\n12:53.000 --> 12:56.000\nWhat's the first thing that they're going to affect?\n\n12:56.000 --> 12:59.000\nThe biggest fear is that, you know, well, they're going to come down\n\n12:59.000 --> 13:03.000\nand they're going to say, all right, y'all, here's the deal.\n\n13:03.000 --> 13:07.000\nWe're a bunch of almond-eyed aliens.\n\n13:07.000 --> 13:10.000\nAnd y'all are real scared of us.\n\n13:10.000 --> 13:13.000\nBut hold on to your seatbelts,\n\n13:13.000 --> 13:16.000\nbecause we're here to get rid of all the trouble, right?\n\n13:16.000 --> 13:18.000\nThey sound nice.\n\n13:18.000 --> 13:21.000\nI know, I have a southern accent and yeah.\n\n13:21.000 --> 13:24.000\nAnd then, and then, and then, you know, what's really going to happen is\n\n13:24.000 --> 13:27.000\nthey're going to start to, well, what they've been doing for the last century.\n\n13:27.000 --> 13:28.000\nWait, wait, what?\n\n13:28.000 --> 13:30.000\nOh, sorry, sorry, did I skip too far ahead?\n\n13:30.000 --> 13:32.000\nThey've been, for the last century.\n\n13:32.000 --> 13:34.000\nThe almond-eyed aliens have been here for a century?\n\n13:34.000 --> 13:36.000\nYeah, yeah, they've been here for a century.\n\n13:36.000 --> 13:38.000\nAnd what they've been doing is they've been abducting humans\n\n13:38.000 --> 13:41.000\nand then they've been fucking, like, interbreeding and shit\n\n13:41.000 --> 13:45.000\nand causing this, because the problem is they can't survive in our atmosphere.\n\n13:45.000 --> 13:48.000\nThey can't, they can't survive in our atmosphere.\n\n13:48.000 --> 13:51.000\nAnd the reason why is because they're a fucking alien with almond eyes,\n\n13:51.000 --> 13:53.000\nthey don't survive in this atmosphere.\n\n13:53.000 --> 13:55.000\nSo what do they do?\n\n13:55.000 --> 13:56.000\nWhat do they do?\n\n13:56.000 --> 13:59.000\nThey live underwater in spaceships, they live underground.\n\n13:59.000 --> 14:00.000\nNot really, Justin.\n\n14:00.000 --> 14:01.000\nYeah, go ahead.\n\n14:01.000 --> 14:04.000\nJustin, what is your beef with almond-shaped eyes?\n\n14:04.000 --> 14:09.000\nAlso, what is the advantage for the aliens to have almond-shaped eyes?\n\n14:09.000 --> 14:11.000\nWhat sort of edge does that give you?\n\n14:11.000 --> 14:13.000\nWell, you got me there.\n\n14:13.000 --> 14:14.000\nYou got me there.\n\n14:14.000 --> 14:18.000\nI'm not even going to try to have an answer for you on that one.\n\n14:18.000 --> 14:23.000\nIn their galaxy, there was, like, you know, there was, a million years ago,\n\n14:23.000 --> 14:27.000\nthere was a huge, like, race war between aliens with saucer-shaped eyes\n\n14:27.000 --> 14:31.000\nand aliens that just had a nightrider slit across their face.\n\n14:31.000 --> 14:32.000\nYes, thank you.\n\n14:32.000 --> 14:35.000\nYou know, it's not just about answers, you're posing questions,\n\n14:35.000 --> 14:39.000\nor you're at least inflecting up at the end of a sentence.\n\n14:39.000 --> 14:42.000\nI have another surprise for you, Justin.\n\n14:42.000 --> 14:45.000\nI'm trying to ease these people into the reality.\n\n14:45.000 --> 14:46.000\nWell, you did not do that.\n\n14:46.000 --> 14:49.000\nIn no sense did you ease anyone into anything.\n\n14:49.000 --> 14:52.000\nYou came in hot.\n\n14:52.000 --> 14:54.000\nYou created chaos.\n\n14:54.000 --> 14:56.000\nThere was no sense if I got a couple of anecdotes,\n\n14:56.000 --> 14:59.000\nand then it was, you came in shouting at traffic.\n\n14:59.000 --> 15:05.000\nListen, you know, you want to believe what you want to believe.\n\n15:05.000 --> 15:06.000\nThat's fine.\n\n15:06.000 --> 15:08.000\nBut I'm telling you right now, they are here.\n\n15:08.000 --> 15:10.000\nThey've been doing all this crazy shit.\n\n15:10.000 --> 15:11.000\nWhat's your proof?\n\n15:11.000 --> 15:14.000\nWhat evidence do you have to convince me?\n\n15:14.000 --> 15:16.000\nThat's a really good question.\n\n15:16.000 --> 15:17.000\nKentrails?\n\n15:17.000 --> 15:18.000\nNo.\n\n15:18.000 --> 15:19.000\nI have another surprise for you.\n\n15:19.000 --> 15:20.000\nYeah, go ahead.\n\n15:20.000 --> 15:21.000\nWe have a medical expert here.\n\n15:21.000 --> 15:22.000\nJesus Christ.\n\n15:22.000 --> 15:23.000\nYes.\n\n15:23.000 --> 15:26.000\nShe worked at St. Scrubs for eight years under Bill Lawrence.\n\n15:26.000 --> 15:27.000\nPlease welcome Sarah Chalk.\n\n15:27.000 --> 15:29.000\nYeah!\n\n15:29.000 --> 15:38.000\nAnd she found out she was doing the show tonight.\n\n15:38.000 --> 15:39.000\nWas it tonight?\n\n15:39.000 --> 15:41.000\nBecause you followed me on Twitter?\n\n15:41.000 --> 15:45.000\nThank God I follow at Dan Harmon on Twitter.\n\n15:45.000 --> 15:49.000\nOtherwise, I'd be like, the dude shouldn't show up tonight.\n\n15:49.000 --> 15:52.000\nI was reading his Twitter, and it was like,\n\n15:52.000 --> 15:55.000\nat Dan Harmon, at Largo, with at John Oliver,\n\n15:55.000 --> 15:58.000\nand I just didn't really do that, Sarah Chalk.\n\n15:58.000 --> 16:00.000\nAnd I was like, oh, I think that's me.\n\n16:00.000 --> 16:02.000\nI apologize.\n\n16:02.000 --> 16:04.000\nAnd then I also get emails from Largo,\n\n16:04.000 --> 16:07.000\nwhich then confirmed that.\n\n16:07.000 --> 16:09.000\nYou are to be here tonight?\n\n16:09.000 --> 16:12.000\nSo have you heard Justin's theories as a medical professional?\n\n16:12.000 --> 16:15.000\nWell, that's not actually why he brought me here.\n\n16:15.000 --> 16:19.000\nI would prefer a de-bonified journalist introduction.\n\n16:19.000 --> 16:24.000\nI'm even less a journalist than you are a doctor.\n\n16:24.000 --> 16:29.000\nLadies and gentlemen, I'm actually one of the results of the interbreeding.\n\n16:29.000 --> 16:31.000\nI don't know if you've noticed my eye shape.\n\n16:31.000 --> 16:34.000\nSarah, you play the mom on Rick and Morty.\n\n16:34.000 --> 16:35.000\nThat's why you're really here.\n\n16:35.000 --> 16:39.000\nAnd John Oliver plays a guest in the...\n\n16:39.000 --> 16:42.000\nWe're going to be showing two episodes.\n\n16:42.000 --> 16:47.000\nAnd John Oliver plays a wonderful character in the second one,\n\n16:47.000 --> 16:49.000\nthe Christmas one, which you'll see tonight.\n\n16:49.000 --> 16:52.000\nI really hope that when you press play, it's not an episode.\n\n16:52.000 --> 16:55.000\nIt's just your face ranting more about aliens.\n\n16:55.000 --> 16:59.000\nI really well thought, like I took the time to really write it out\n\n16:59.000 --> 17:01.000\nand make it clear.\n\n17:01.000 --> 17:05.000\nIt's just my face with a glowing backlight.\n\n17:05.000 --> 17:07.000\nBecause you guys have no idea what to expect.\n\n17:07.000 --> 17:11.000\nHave you seen anything of Rick and Morty since you did your voice work in front of a microphone?\n\n17:11.000 --> 17:13.000\nNo, I haven't.\n\n17:13.000 --> 17:18.000\nI saw a couple of the animatics from early on, but I got...\n\n17:18.000 --> 17:19.000\nThat's what it's called, right?\n\n17:19.000 --> 17:20.000\nAnimatics?\n\n17:20.000 --> 17:21.000\nThe animatics.\n\n17:21.000 --> 17:24.000\nThat's how you pronounce it in Canada.\n\n17:24.000 --> 17:28.000\nBut I got the part because I could burp on cue, right, Justin?\n\n17:28.000 --> 17:30.000\nYou're very good.\n\n17:30.000 --> 17:32.000\nVery easy to direct.\n\n17:32.000 --> 17:36.000\nIn fact, most of the time, no direction necessary at all.\n\n17:36.000 --> 17:38.000\nShe shows up and...\n\n17:38.000 --> 17:40.000\nAll right, that's it. We're done.\n\n17:40.000 --> 17:41.000\nYou did a great job.\n\n17:41.000 --> 17:42.000\nIs that because...\n\n17:42.000 --> 17:44.000\nCut it in and print, wrap.\n\n17:44.000 --> 17:46.000\nIs that because you weren't listening to her?\n\n17:46.000 --> 17:48.000\nYou were thinking about Elizabeth.\n\n17:48.000 --> 17:49.000\nYes.\n\n17:49.000 --> 17:50.000\nYes.\n\n17:50.000 --> 17:51.000\nThat was good, Sarah.\n\n17:51.000 --> 17:53.000\nIt's just I got bigger issues right now.\n\n17:53.000 --> 17:55.000\nI need to live underground.\n\n17:55.000 --> 17:57.000\nIt's hard to multitask the direction of an actor\n\n17:57.000 --> 18:00.000\nwhile you're putting canned goods on a shelf\n\n18:00.000 --> 18:02.000\nand shotgun shells.\n\n18:02.000 --> 18:03.000\nHow easy...\n\n18:03.000 --> 18:05.000\nYou guys all laugh and mock me, but I swear to God,\n\n18:05.000 --> 18:07.000\nwhen they fucking show up\n\n18:07.000 --> 18:09.000\nand you guys are all going like,\n\n18:09.000 --> 18:11.000\nfuck, you fucking with Sirius, right?\n\n18:11.000 --> 18:14.000\nWhen they show up, you said they've been here for a century.\n\n18:14.000 --> 18:15.000\nYeah, they've been here for a century.\n\n18:15.000 --> 18:17.000\nNow you're warning us about them arriving.\n\n18:17.000 --> 18:18.000\nWell, here's the deal.\n\n18:18.000 --> 18:20.000\nI mean, they've been here for a century.\n\n18:20.000 --> 18:21.000\nHere's the thing.\n\n18:21.000 --> 18:23.000\nThey cannot survive in our atmosphere, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n18:23.000 --> 18:25.000\nNo, they have for a century by your own...\n\n18:25.000 --> 18:27.000\nNo, they can't...\n\n18:27.000 --> 18:28.000\nI'm texting you.\n\n18:28.000 --> 18:30.000\nThey can't live on the surface of Earth, okay?\n\n18:30.000 --> 18:33.000\nThey can't just walk around and skate around like we do\n\n18:33.000 --> 18:35.000\nand ride our bikes and shit.\n\n18:35.000 --> 18:36.000\nThey can't do that.\n\n18:36.000 --> 18:38.000\nSo what they've been doing is they've been interbreeding\n\n18:38.000 --> 18:41.000\nwith our species for two reasons.\n\n18:41.000 --> 18:43.000\nOne, because if they fucking, you know,\n\n18:43.000 --> 18:44.000\ninterbreed with our species,\n\n18:44.000 --> 18:46.000\nthen they're going to have a connection to humanity, right?\n\n18:46.000 --> 18:47.000\nRight.\n\n18:47.000 --> 18:48.000\nSo when they do finally show up and go,\n\n18:48.000 --> 18:51.000\noh, we've finally, after 100 years and some odd change,\n\n18:51.000 --> 18:54.000\nwe've finally made a fucking version of hybrid us and you.\n\n18:54.000 --> 18:58.000\nThat can totally live and hang out on Earth without any trouble.\n\n18:58.000 --> 19:00.000\nThen the fucking...\n\n19:00.000 --> 19:03.000\nI feel like a majority of us would then, at that point, go,\n\n19:03.000 --> 19:06.000\nwell, you should have been up front about it, but welcome.\n\n19:06.000 --> 19:12.000\nIt's kind of our stock and trade is intermingling of DNA.\n\n19:12.000 --> 19:14.000\nThat's what we've been up to this whole time.\n\n19:14.000 --> 19:16.000\nAnd then that's going to happen, like he said.\n\n19:16.000 --> 19:20.000\nAnd then they're going to be like, oh, and here, by the way...\n\n19:20.000 --> 19:21.000\nOkay, sorry.\n\n19:21.000 --> 19:22.000\nNo, you go ahead.\n\n19:22.000 --> 19:25.000\nWell, I was going to say, like, oh, hey, I fucking,\n\n19:25.000 --> 19:27.000\nthe people we made that are hybrids,\n\n19:27.000 --> 19:29.000\nthey're telepathically connected with us,\n\n19:29.000 --> 19:31.000\nbut, you know, they're related to you, so you can't hate them.\n\n19:31.000 --> 19:32.000\nAnd here we go.\n\n19:32.000 --> 19:35.000\nAnd then all of a sudden, flash forward 100 years,\n\n19:35.000 --> 19:37.000\nwe're all now telepathically connected with them.\n\n19:37.000 --> 19:39.000\nAnd now they're monitoring our dreams.\n\n19:39.000 --> 19:41.000\nAnd now they're recording every thought we have,\n\n19:41.000 --> 19:42.000\nbecause they're all fucking,\n\n19:42.000 --> 19:44.000\nwe all have their DNA pumping through our blood.\n\n19:44.000 --> 19:46.000\nAnd then they enslave us.\n\n19:46.000 --> 19:47.000\nOh, no.\n\n19:47.000 --> 19:49.000\nAnd take over the resources of the planet Earth.\n\n19:49.000 --> 19:53.000\nThis is getting so close to a racial purity argument.\n\n19:53.000 --> 19:57.000\nYou just need to substitute two words in any of that.\n\n19:57.000 --> 19:59.000\nI'm trying to warn you from this.\n\n19:59.000 --> 20:01.000\nWe as a

abductions\n\n24:42.000 --> 24:44.000\nin sexual or in transplants are taken.\n\n24:44.000 --> 24:46.000\nNo, I didn't want you to move to Canada.\n\n24:46.000 --> 24:48.000\nTell Sarah and Chuck everything you want to tell me.\n\n24:48.000 --> 24:50.000\nLook, Sarah and Chuck and the almond eyes\n\n24:50.000 --> 24:51.000\nand ask her about it.\n\n24:51.000 --> 24:52.000\nSarah, have a dialogue.\n\n24:52.000 --> 24:54.000\nWill you tell these people that, like,\n\n24:54.000 --> 24:55.000\nit's all good if they want to come here\n\n24:55.000 --> 24:57.000\nand, you know, save us from ourselves\n\n24:57.000 --> 24:59.000\nand, you know, stop all the pollution\n\n24:59.000 --> 25:00.000\nand get rid of all these nuclear weapons,\n\n25:00.000 --> 25:04.000\nbut can they just totally not enslave us as a race\n\n25:04.000 --> 25:06.000\nand then, like, kill us off\n\n25:06.000 --> 25:08.000\nand, you know, make this crazy...\n\n25:08.000 --> 25:10.000\nYou know, we're just going to be lifting weights for them.\n\n25:10.000 --> 25:11.000\nWe're going to be building pyramids for them.\n\n25:11.000 --> 25:12.000\nBut then what would be the point?\n\n25:12.000 --> 25:15.000\nWhy

actually do run everything.\n\n25:22.000 --> 25:26.000\nI can't believe you're winning me over with this, but...\n\n25:26.000 --> 25:28.000\nI mean, it is a compelling argument.\n\n25:28.000 --> 25:30.000\nYou know what, guys?\n\n25:30.000 --> 25:32.000\nHonestly, the really bad stuff won't happen\n\n25:32.000 --> 25:34.000\ntill after we're all dead anyways.\n\n25:34.000 --> 25:35.000\nRight.\n\n25:35.000 --> 25:36.000\nAnd don't you think, Sarah, as a representative...\n\n25:36.000 --> 25:38.000\nShe's right. She's totally right.\n\n25:38.000 --> 25:39.000\n...of the aliens, wouldn't you think...\n\n25:39.000 --> 25:42.000\nGuys like me and Justin and John Oliver and Jeff\n\n25:42.000 --> 25:44.000\nand most of the people here in the Harbin Town audience,\n\n25:44.000 --> 25:46.000\nwe'd be kind of like...\n\n25:46.000 --> 25:48.000\nWe'd have a pass, right?\n\n25:48.000 --> 25:49.000\nYeah, yeah.

I like that.\n\n26:18.000 --> 26:21.000\nI can write with my feet, so all of the writing will be\n\n26:21.000 --> 26:23.000\nwith my feet. That's how you can tell I'm an alien,\n\n26:23.000 --> 26:25.000\nbecause I have finger toes. They're half the length of my feet.\n\n26:25.000 --> 26:27.000\nYou know, I've got to tell you.\n\n26:27.000 --> 26:30.000\nI feel like Justin's paranoia was dispelled\n\n26:30.000 --> 26:32.000\nsimply by a woman looking him in the eyes.\n\n26:34.000 --> 26:37.000\nWhich could be said about a lot of Internet...\n\n26:37.000 --> 26:39.000\nFrom the almond eyes.\n\n26:39.000 --> 26:42.000\nSometimes you just need Sarah Chalk to stare at you for a moment,\n\n26:42.000 --> 26:44.000\nand you're stopping...\n\n26:44.000 --> 26:47.000\nListen, if all the aliens, hybrid, human,\n\n26:47.000 --> 26:49.000\ngrays look like her, then fine.\n\n26:49.000 --> 26:51.000\nWhat?
