{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:12.600\nLive from the Nerdmelt Theater in beautiful Hollywood, California,\n\n00:12.600 --> 00:14.600\nHarmontown is now in session!\n\n00:14.600 --> 00:25.600\nAnd now, let's welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmontown, also my man, Dan Harmon!\n\n00:25.600 --> 00:35.600\nThank you, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry about everything.\n\n00:35.600 --> 00:40.600\nWell you were here, I mean we were all, we all thought everything was fine.\n\n00:40.600 --> 00:45.600\nI am out of practice at being quite so clickable, clickably delicious.\n\n00:45.600 --> 00:58.600\nI'm fine with it, I don't know if anyone was bothering to feel sorry for me, but I'm getting really used to this.\n\n00:58.600 --> 01:05.600\nI have a publicist now whose job is to keep, make me less famous.\n\n01:05.600 --> 01:14.600\nHe's a really cool guy, I don't imagine he'd ever come on the show and answer questions about what it means to be Dan Harmon's publicist.\n\n01:14.600 --> 01:17.600\nI think that would be a really interesting interview.\n\n01:17.600 --> 01:21.600\nCan you talk about your Hollywood Reporter photo shoot?\n\n01:21.600 --> 01:29.600\nNo, I can't because it's technically a joke about, oh, that involves the concept that, I can't.\n\n01:29.600 --> 01:32.600\nSorry, I've already screwed up, I gotta write a letter.\n\n01:32.600 --> 01:39.600\nComptroller Erin McGathy, let us know what it is.\n\n01:39.600 --> 01:47.600\nWell let's just, I mean I think I can beat around that word and not be quotable.\n\n01:47.600 --> 01:55.600\nObviously as my publicist, this guy is a little, he's got his hands full sometimes.\n\n01:55.600 --> 02:07.600\nAnd they came to do a photo shoot of me for this article that Dan's happy and he's humble and he's back and he's happy to be back at work.\n\n02:07.600 --> 02:11.600\nAnd he was like, yeah, just smile a lot.\n\n02:11.600 --> 02:19.600\nDon't let him get any pictures of you frowning or doing anything other than just smiling a lot.\n\n02:19.600 --> 02:27.600\nThere's no sets at Paramount that are up, their construction hasn't begun,\n\n02:27.600 --> 02:33.600\nbut there is one facade that's like, if you're a huge fan of community you might know what I'm talking about when I say Borchard Hall.\n\n02:33.600 --> 02:39.600\nIt's a cross on the Paramount lot from where the library steps usually are,\n\n02:39.600 --> 02:42.600\nbut the library steps aren't there and so this is the only thing.\n\n02:42.600 --> 02:51.600\nIt's got the Greendale insignia on the door and it says Borchard Hall at the top and the photographer tells me,\n\n02:51.600 --> 02:58.600\nyeah, just go through the door and then you're coming in so you just kind of open the door a little bit and stick your head through.\n\n02:58.600 --> 03:05.600\nLong story short, very creepy photo.\n\n03:05.600 --> 03:14.600\nDaddy's home and he's been drinking and publicist's face just purple.\n\n03:14.600 --> 03:17.600\nYeah, but I brought him on for a while in season.\n\n03:17.600 --> 03:22.600\nI don't know, was it two or three or something like that because I actually felt like,\n\n03:22.600 --> 03:28.600\nwell, if people want to do interviews with me and stuff that can help get ratings for the show,\n\n03:28.600 --> 03:32.600\nlike it's a form of promotion if I bring him on out of pocket and stuff.\n\n03:32.600 --> 03:36.600\nSo originally his job was to help me be famous.\n\n03:36.600 --> 03:38.600\nI think that's generally what a publicist's job was.\n\n03:38.600 --> 03:40.600\nThey probably say it's more nuanced than that,\n\n03:40.600 --> 03:44.600\nbut also just get me Comic-Con badges or something.\n\n03:44.600 --> 03:49.600\nHe's just a handy guy to have around and then I let him go after a while because I was like,\n\n03:49.600 --> 03:52.600\nokay, no one's ever going to watch the show no matter what.\n\n03:52.600 --> 03:54.600\nAnd also I got fired and blah, blah, blah.\n\n03:54.600 --> 03:56.600\nI was like, take some time off.\n\n03:56.600 --> 03:58.600\nCool your jets.\n\n03:58.600 --> 04:03.600\nAnd I brought him back on to actually just help me.\n\n04:03.600 --> 04:06.600\nGod, save me from myself.\n\n04:06.600 --> 04:08.600\nAnyways.\n\n04:08.600 --> 04:11.600\nYeah, so it is a funny thing.\n\n04:11.600 --> 04:13.600\nThis new phenomenon, it's called context.\n\n04:13.600 --> 04:15.600\nIt's a weird, weird thing.\n\n04:15.600 --> 04:23.600\nI've said many times, this is my therapy.\n\n04:23.600 --> 04:26.600\nI have enough voices bouncing around in my head to deal with.\n\n04:26.600 --> 04:28.600\nI don't want my own in there too.\n\n04:28.600 --> 04:35.600\nAnd when I say the stuff that's in my head into a microphone and people laugh or even just sit there and don't stab me,\n\n04:35.600 --> 04:39.600\nit's done, it's finished, it's dealt with.\n\n04:39.600 --> 04:45.600\nGo on.\n\n04:45.600 --> 04:52.600\nAnd so every once in a while, from this crucible, this 60 episode run of this online diary that I'm keeping called Armatown,\n\n04:52.600 --> 05:02.600\nthis little magma drop of harmonious like flies out and lands in the shire and just bursts everything into play.\n\n05:02.600 --> 05:10.600\nAnd you realize, oh, God, guess what, everybody that was hurt or anything like that,\n\n05:10.600 --> 05:16.600\nI guarantee you that when I want to speak to you in the form of a headline in Variety,\n\n05:16.600 --> 05:23.600\nI'll say much, much nicer things than I do to my bathroom mirror or here or stuff like that.\n\n05:23.600 --> 05:25.600\nI'm not excusing anything.\n\n05:25.600 --> 05:27.600\nI just wanted to make that clear.\n\n05:27.600 --> 05:29.600\nWhy do these things happen?\n\n05:29.600 --> 05:32.600\nLanguage is important to me too.\n\n05:32.600 --> 05:33.600\nI'm a writer, definitely.\n\n05:33.600 --> 05:35.600\nBut I improvise when I'm up here.\n\n05:35.600 --> 05:37.600\nAnd I've said some really horrible things.\n\n05:37.600 --> 05:41.600\nAnybody who wants to really, really hate me, just go through.\n\n05:41.600 --> 05:44.600\nI don't know what will happen to you.\n\n05:44.600 --> 05:46.600\nI've never listened to all of it either, but it's there.\n\n05:46.600 --> 05:48.600\nI am here for you.\n\n05:48.600 --> 05:50.600\nI am on Twitter.\n\n05:50.600 --> 05:53.600\nI blog my apologies when I do things wrong.\n\n05:53.600 --> 05:56.600\nI do the Reddit AMAs.\n\n05:56.600 --> 05:59.600\nI like being in touch with people.\n\n05:59.600 --> 06:05.600\nI think the big takeaway from this latest debacle for me emotionally was,\n\n06:05.600 --> 06:09.600\nI got to somehow figure out at the age of 40 how to stop caring so much.\n\n06:09.600 --> 06:11.600\nWhat about people's opinion of me?\n\n06:11.600 --> 06:16.600\nBecause I think that the reason I do what I do,\n\n06:16.600 --> 06:19.600\nI know that the reason I do what I do is to make people like me.\n\n06:19.600 --> 06:23.600\nAnd I'm very comfortable with the idea that what you're supposed to like is the thing that I make.\n\n06:23.600 --> 06:31.600\nThere's nothing inappropriate or wrong way rubbing about an episode of my NBC sitcom.\n\n06:31.600 --> 06:34.600\nAnd there's nothing dishonest about it either.\n\n06:34.600 --> 06:40.600\nIt is an actual genuine Valentine to humanity that I have time to prepare and polish\n\n06:40.600 --> 06:44.600\nand put on my little bow tie and show up to your door with flowers and candy.\n\n06:44.600 --> 06:48.600\nThat's me at my best for you in that context so that you will go,\n\n06:48.600 --> 06:53.600\noh, I feel happy right now. Who made me happy? Oh, it says created by so-and-so.\n\n06:53.600 --> 06:55.600\nOh, he must be a good person.\n\n06:55.600 --> 07:02.600\nAnd I guess I've got to cop to the fact that I never will be.\n\n07:02.600 --> 07:07.600\nI guess because under, you know, or nobody's a good person.\n\n07:07.600 --> 07:18.600\nSteve Levitan doesn't have a show where he just babbles into a microphone with a cup of vodka.\n\n07:18.600 --> 07:25.600\nAnd that is why he is a better person than me and will die richer and have higher ratings\n\n07:25.600 --> 07:28.600\nand be more successful. God, he's so handsome too.\n\n07:28.600 --> 07:33.600\nHave you ever seen a photo of Google Steve Levitan? It's obnoxious.\n\n07:33.600 --> 07:38.600\nHe's so good-looking.\n\n07:38.600 --> 07:43.600\nSo anyways, I happened just by pure circumstance and I thought, you know,\n\n07:43.600 --> 07:46.600\njust as Spencer showing up and saying, I want to be a Dungeon Master,\n\n07:46.600 --> 07:54.600\nlike, Harmontown kind of runs on coincidences and mysticism and shamanic events.\n\n07:54.600 --> 08:00.600\nI was at a bar. That is not an unusual event.\n\n08:00.600 --> 08:07.600\nThat's just statistics. I was at a bar and ran into friends of our producer, Dusty Samples,\n\n08:07.600 --> 08:15.600\nDustin Marshall, and these two adorable little kids.\n\n08:15.600 --> 08:18.600\nThey're from this band called Mars Argo.\n\n08:18.600 --> 08:23.600\nAnd they just recently, I mean, they're, you know, they're great.\n\n08:23.600 --> 08:31.600\nI assume I have a horrible taste of music, but they just recently did this thing\n\n08:31.600 --> 08:35.600\nwhere they did a song, I think it was called Don't Call Me.\n\n08:35.600 --> 08:37.600\nIs that the name of the song?\n\n08:37.600 --> 08:44.600\nIt's based on a sample of the iPhone ringtone Marimba that we all know.\n\n08:44.600 --> 08:48.600\nLike, when you hear the song for the first eight seconds, you're checking your pockets\n\n08:48.600 --> 08:53.600\nand it's like a baby crying on an airplane for that eight seconds.\n\n08:53.600 --> 08:58.600\nAnd it's a song about a guy that won't stop calling and it fits.\n\n08:58.600 --> 09:01.600\nAnd after a while, you stop hearing that and just hear like a really nice song.\n\n09:01.600 --> 09:05.600\nIt doesn't matter if it's a good song or a bad song.\n\n09:05.600 --> 09:10.600\nThe interesting thing is that because it uses that iPhone sample,\n\n09:10.600 --> 09:15.600\nall of a sudden, much as sometimes a Harmontown droplet lands in the headlines of Variety\n\n09:15.600 --> 09:20.600\nand all of a sudden I'm being compared to Charlie Sheen by Society,\n\n09:20.600 --> 09:23.600\nI'm a writer.\n\n09:23.600 --> 09:26.600\nOkay.\n\n09:26.600 --> 09:34.600\nThese guys, because of this iPhone hook, you know, it's now it's a, you know,\n\n09:34.600 --> 09:36.600\nall of a sudden it's just a thing.\n\n09:36.600 --> 09:39.600\nIt's got to, I guess, I'll be an old fogey and say it went viral.\n\n09:39.600 --> 09:47.600\nIt was like in the technology section of this thing and the Apple lovers section of this thing\n\n09:47.600 --> 09:50.600\nand the what's going on section of this and that.\n\n09:50.600 --> 09:54.600\nKind of like it was a virality happened and as a result,\n\n09:54.600 --> 10:00.600\nthey suddenly found themselves as very emotional, wonderful, passionate musicians\n\n10:00.600 --> 10:03.600\nand something that's become increasingly familiar to me,\n\n10:03.600 --> 10:07.600\nwhich is being under this microscope of this giant blob\n\n10:07.600 --> 10:10.600\ncalled people who don't normally give a fuck about you.\n\n10:10.600 --> 10:14.600\nAnd let's continue the conversation with them on stage.\n\n10:14.600 --> 10:18.600\nPlease welcome Titanic Sinclair and Mars Argo of Mars Argo.\n\n10:18.600 --> 10:32.600\nI'm kind of short.\n\n10:32.600 --> 10:34.600\nThat's good. That's good these days.\n\n10:34.600 --> 10:36.600\nI wore shorts too.\n\n10:36.600 --> 10:38.600\nShort is the new tall.\n\n10:38.600 --> 10:40.600\nCute matching hats, guys.\n\n10:40.600 --> 10:41.600\nIt was unplanned.\n\n10:41.600 --> 10:44.600\nWe're all dinkies.\n\n10:44.600 --> 10:48.600\nSo describe the reason I called you guys.\n\n10:48.600 --> 10:53.600\nI asked you guys if you would come here is because I ran into Titanic.\n\n10:53.600 --> 10:55.600\nIt's a stage name.\n\n10:55.600 --> 10:58.600\nBecause of the death threats.\n\n10:58.600 --> 11:05.600\nAnd Mars was not there and you were looking kind of,\n\n11:05.600 --> 11:08.600\nyou were chill, I won't say sullen.\n\n11:08.600 --> 11:16.600\nYou were, your emo had an extra genuine emo to it.\n\n11:16.600 --> 11:18.600\nSomething there.\n\n11:18.600 --> 11:25.600\nAnd immediately in a short conversation it turned out that Mars was at home\n\n11:25.600 --> 11:32.600\nunable to really go out because of the response and the comment sections\n\n11:32.600 --> 11:36.600\nunder these videos that are being posted, right?\n\n11:36.600 --> 11:38.600\nI'm also actually sick.\n\n11:38.600 --> 11:43.600\nBut yeah, I think maybe the whole thing kind of threw me over a little bit.\n\n11:43.600 --> 11:45.600\nIt probably lowered your immune system.\n\n11:45.600 --> 11:46.600\nPossibly, yeah.\n\n11:46.600 --> 11:47.600\nMy cat's living with a dog now.\n\n11:47.600 --> 11:49.600\nI think she's going to, she has FIB.\n\n11:49.600 --> 11:53.600\nI'm worried that she's going to die at any moment because I think that T-cells,\n\n11:53.600 --> 11:55.600\nI think they're linked to your emotional health.\n\n11:55.600 --> 11:58.600\nThe dancing that he thinks you're going to die at any moment.\n\n11:58.600 --> 12:00.600\nMaybe.\n\n12:00.600 --> 12:02.600\nI don't know where to start.\n\n12:02.600 --> 12:05.600\nBy the way, I'm a horrible interviewer to deal with it.\n\n12:05.600 --> 12:12.600\nDo you have in your head an example of a comment that really got you,\n\n12:12.600 --> 12:16.600\nthat made you unable to leave your home?\n\n12:16.600 --> 12:19.600\nWhat an ugly singer.\n\n12:19.600 --> 12:21.600\nWhat an ugly voice.\n\n12:21.600 --> 12:24.600\nWhich is almost worse than what an ugly singer.\n\n12:24.600 --> 12:30.600\nI guarantee you we've been threatened with dying of fire more than anyone else.\n\n12:30.600 --> 12:31.600\nYeah.\n\n12:31.600 --> 12:33.600\nOr if you burn in a fire, I hope you.\n\n12:33.600 --> 12:36.600\nWe have a YouTube channel.\n\n12:36.600 --> 12:38.600\nIt's called Grocery Bag That TV if anyone's interested.\n\n12:38.600 --> 12:43.600\nAnd it's like, we poke fun at social commentary and stuff.\n\n12:43.600 --> 12:48.600\nAnd so people consistently tell us to die in a fire.\n\n12:48.600 --> 12:49.600\nSo I'm used to that.\n\n12:49.600 --> 12:51.600\nBut this kind of spiraled out of control.\n\n12:51.600 --> 12:56.600\nI knew we were getting ourselves into trouble by using the iPhone song to begin with.\n\n12:56.600 --> 12:59.600\nBut I had no idea it was going to be so intense.\n\n12:59.600 --> 13:01.600\nYou thought it would be critical trouble.\n\n13:01.600 --> 13:05.600\nYou were used to a certain context, like I am here.\n\n13:05.600 --> 13:10.600\nYou knew that something you did, as most artists are required to do,\n\n13:10.600 --> 13:13.600\nwas going to be hit or miss and have some polarizing effect.\n\n13:13.600 --> 13:22.600\nBut you were, I think, not to put words in your mouth, but the effect of all of a sudden this whole new audience\n\n13:22.600 --> 13:28.600\ncalled just people who don't, they're just reacting to something random.\n\n13:28.600 --> 13:33.600\nThey just see a headline that has nothing to do with, that was the big trouble that I got into.\n\n13:33.600 --> 13:38.600\nBecause I came out here and I reacted to the boohoo for me,\n\n13:38.600 --> 13:43.600\nsuch a sensation of watching a season of the show that I hadn't watched the entire time.\n\n13:43.600 --> 13:44.600\nIt was without me.\n\n13:44.600 --> 13:46.600\nAnd I just kind of came out here and was like,\n\n13:46.600 --> 13:50.600\njust without thinking about any kind of context or who was listening,\n\n13:50.600 --> 13:55.600\nexcept for these 150 people and anyone that listens to a podcast about me,\n\n13:55.600 --> 13:59.600\nand therefore why would someone that hated me and didn't care what I had to say?\n\n13:59.600 --> 14:00.600\nBlah, blah, blah.\n\n14:00.600 --> 14:03.600\nI just kind of didn't think and just spoke.\n\n14:03.600 --> 14:09.600\nBut then immediately, and it's like, why wouldn't I, this headline just goes like,\n\n14:09.600 --> 14:13.600\nDan Harmon says this has a headline.\n\n14:13.600 --> 14:15.600\nIt's like, no, that was not a headline.\n\n14:15.600 --> 14:17.600\nThat wasn't a press conference.\n\n14:17.600 --> 14:24.600\nAnd now the horrible thing is you have people who, even if they are horrible people,\n\n14:24.600 --> 14:28.600\nthey're not even really to blame for the fact that,\n\n14:28.600 --> 14:32.600\nif you're surfing through the internet and a thing says under sports and weather,\n\n14:32.600 --> 14:38.600\nit says, band makes song out of a ringtone.\n\n14:38.600 --> 14:43.600\nAnd then they click on it and then they watch the thing.\n\n14:43.600 --> 14:47.600\nAnd it's like, I don't know what makes them go as far.\n\n14:47.600 --> 14:48.600\nI've never done that before.\n\n14:48.600 --> 14:52.600\nI have never left a comment that I thought would make someone want to kill themselves.\n\n14:52.600 --> 14:58.600\nI have to assume, as a student of human character,\n\n14:58.600 --> 15:02.600\nI have to assume that the reason people do that is because they don't believe it's possible.\n\n15:02.600 --> 15:05.600\nIt's like shooting a slingshot at the moon.\n\n15:05.600 --> 15:08.600\nThey're just going like, hey, why don't you kill yourself?\n\n15:08.600 --> 15:10.600\nYou stupid, ugly person with a horrible voice.\n\n15:10.600 --> 15:11.600\nThis is a terrible song.\n\n15:11.600 --> 15:13.600\nYour band sucks, blah, blah, blah.\n\n15:13.600 --> 15:20.600\nThey're just thinking like, well, don't never listen to old Toby Simmons.\n\n15:20.600 --> 15:24.600\nBut the irony is that you guys are Toby Simmons.\n\n15:24.600 --> 15:29.600\nIt's just a band from Detroit that is out in Hollywood.\n\n15:29.600 --> 15:32.600\nAnd everyone is Toby Simmons.\n\n15:32.600 --> 15:36.600\nWe are now all in contact with each other.\n\n15:36.600 --> 15:40.600\nWhat band was that that got in that airplane accident?\n\n15:40.600 --> 15:45.600\nOne of them was rolling out of the plane on fire with a Blink-182 gun.\n\n15:45.600 --> 15:51.600\nSo of course, because it's Blink-182, it's okay for them to burn to death.\n\n15:51.600 --> 15:55.600\nPeople are just leaving comments.\n\n15:55.600 --> 16:01.600\nI forgot people are now going to publish transcripts of my podcast.\n\n16:01.600 --> 16:06.600\nDo you please put some brackets in there that I was being ironic?\n\n16:06.600 --> 16:10.600\nAnd put brackets behind everything that says I'm a human fucking being.\n\n16:10.600 --> 16:13.600\nDon't publish transcripts of podcasts.\n\n16:13.600 --> 16:16.600\nIt's all free. It's all online.\n\n16:16.600 --> 16:23.600\nAnyways, he said winkingly,\n\n16:23.600 --> 16:26.600\nit's okay for Blink-182 to be on fire, right?\n\n16:26.600 --> 16:29.600\nBecause they don't deserve anything that they have and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.\n\n16:29.600 --> 16:33.600\nAnd the people are saying, you're saying they're threatening you.\n\n16:33.600 --> 16:36.600\nThey're saying, die by fire. You're actually used to that.\n\n16:36.600 --> 16:39.600\nBands die in fires a lot. It happens.\n\n16:39.600 --> 16:43.600\nThat's an issue.\n\n16:43.600 --> 16:47.600\nMore bands than lion tamers.\n\n16:47.600 --> 16:51.600\nLion tamers get sometimes bit by lions.\n\n16:51.600 --> 16:55.600\nThat would be rude to leave under Siegfried and Roy's YouTube channel.\n\n16:55.600 --> 16:59.600\nLike, I hope you get bit by a lion.\n\n16:59.600 --> 17:02.600\nMean.\n\n17:02.600 --> 17:11.600\nSo, talk about being at home that night.\n\n17:11.600 --> 17:14.600\nI was at the drying room.\n\n17:14.600 --> 17:17.600\nWhat did you physically do?\n\n17:17.600 --> 17:20.600\nActually, I don't know.\n\n17:20.600 --> 17:23.600\nDo you sit there and troll through all the comments?\n\n17:23.600 --> 17:27.600\nIt's weird because it started on Reddit.\n\n17:27.600 --> 17:30.600\nA lot of our stuff gets posted on Reddit.\n\n17:30.600 --> 17:32.600\nI use Reddit like crazy.\n\n17:32.600 --> 17:37.600\nIt's usually pretty friendly, but I could tell right off the bat from the first couple of comments.\n\n17:37.600 --> 17:40.600\nIt wasn't going to be good.\n\n17:40.600 --> 17:42.600\nI don't know.\n\n17:42.600 --> 17:46.600\nI read a couple and the general consensus was, this is annoying.\n\n17:46.600 --> 17:48.600\nHer voice is annoying.\n\n17:48.600 --> 17:51.600\nYou get to a point where it's like every single comment and then the views start going up.\n\n17:51.600 --> 17:54.600\nThen you're just like, I'm just going to stop reading these now.\n\n17:54.600 --> 17:57.600\nYeah, but no, I keep reading them.\n\n17:57.600 --> 18:02.600\nDid you get to the point, I don't know if you're able to answer this question.\n\n18:02.600 --> 18:06.600\nHave you gotten to the point where you wish the song didn't exist?\n\n18:06.600 --> 18:08.600\nDo you wish that you hadn't created something?\n\n18:08.600 --> 18:15.600\nWhen we tracked that, we had two engineers that bailed on us right when we were tracking it.\n\n18:15.600 --> 18:17.600\nWhat do you mean by that?\n\n18:17.600 --> 18:23.600\nWhen we were actually shooting the thing, we were doing this on a shoestring and two engineers that agreed to do it\n\n18:23.600 --> 18:28.600\ndidn't show up on the day of the shoot and then we had issues with camera stuff and everything.\n\n18:28.600 --> 18:34.600\nI knew before I released it that it wasn't my favorite thing or it wasn't the best vocal take\n\n18:34.600 --> 18:39.600\nmaybe it wasn't the best mix or whatever, but at the same time I'm like whatever.\n\n18:39.600 --> 18:43.600\nBut your job as an artist is to put it out there.\n\n18:43.600 --> 18:49.600\nTake off the top of your head, hold a piece of paper to get as accurate a print of who you are\n\n18:49.600 --> 18:52.600\nduring your limited time on this planet and get it out there.\n\n18:52.600 --> 18:56.600\nSo I did, I was uncomfortable but I was just like alright, there you go.\n\n18:56.600 --> 19:02.600\nAnd then it was just like a bunch of old men talking shit to me basically.\n\n19:02.600 --> 19:06.600\nPeople always say there's no such thing as bad press but I don't think that,\n\n19:06.600 --> 19:12.600\nI don't think the people who say that have ever got an email but no subject and the body of the email is just kill yourself.\n\n19:12.600 --> 19:14.600\nI need that.\n\n19:14.600 --> 19:16.600\nI have several, several of these.\n\n19:16.600 --> 19:18.600\nThat's so terrible.\n\n19:18.600 --> 19:23.600\nHow did you guys process that as a couple?\n\n19:23.600 --> 19:27.600\nI feel it now, I drank it, I got really sick and I'm still sick.\n\n19:27.600 --> 19:31.600\nI'm sure I was sick anyway, but whatever.\n\n19:31.600 --> 19:35.600\nBut you say yourself, because this is something that's been happening to me over the last two days,\n\n19:35.600 --> 19:42.600\nand again I'm used to it, I know that it takes a week for my horrible clumsy footprints to get snowed over\n\n19:42.600 --> 19:51.600\nand I can safely go maybe take a peek into Tumblr without seeing a photo of me looking like I just sexually assaulted a woman.\n\n19:51.600 --> 20:02.600\nThe hand picked from God knows where, someone who's become ironically my biggest fan in order to find that picture.\n\n20:02.600 --> 20:12.600\nThe weird thing is, because I don't know what's healthy and unhealthy, you love being on Reddit,\n\n20:12.600 --> 20:18.600\nyou go through it and you're not just Reddit looking for your own name and looking at your own subreddit and things,\n\n20:18.600 --> 20:25.600\nbut now you're on Reddit and all of a sudden this thing that's a big part of your life is like, I would assume,\n\n20:25.600 --> 20:29.600\nor are you ghoulishly, self-loathingly scouring that stuff?\n\n20:29.600 --> 20:37.600\nThere's a certain amount of ego that when tens of thousands of people are looking at something that you made,\n\n20:37.600 --> 20:44.600\nit feels good even if people are shitting on it, but it just makes you question humanity.\n\n20:44.600 --> 20:52.600\nWho takes the time to, even though it's so easy to click on the YouTube comment and leave something shitty,\n\n20:52.600 --> 20:56.600\nbut who actually puts that energy into it, although I guess thinking about it now,\n\n20:56.600 --> 21:03.600\nI was telling you I was translating Russian, because someone leaves a comment on your video and it's in Russian\n\n21:03.600 --> 21:09.600\nand you're like, I know this is going to be bad, but I'm still going to Google translate it.\n\n21:09.600 --> 21:14.600\nI guess it was something along the lines of you fucking suck.\n\n21:14.600 --> 21:21.600\nIn Russia, bad band kills you.\n\n21:21.600 --> 21:27.600\nWell, that's another weird thing, when you are scrolling through things,\n\n21:27.600 --> 21:30.600\nit's the weirdest thing.\n\n21:30.600 --> 21:38.600\nPeople, I will skim through people being supportive, people being kind,\n\n21:38.600 --> 21:42.600\nsaying a nice thing, and this is under normal circumstances.\n\n21:42.600 --> 21:45.600\nWhen I say something scandalous, I can't really go near it,\n\n21:45.600 --> 21:48.600\nand maybe that's the healthiest thing of the habit that I've picked up,\n\n21:48.600 --> 21:59.600\nbut in olden times, when I was just a regular nobody that was excited about maybe someone talking about me once in a while,\n\n21:59.600 --> 22:04.600\nanything that I was involved in that I would scroll through and I was like,\n\n22:04.600 --> 22:09.600\nthis is great phrases. I'm part of the problem too.\n\n22:09.600 --> 22:11.600\nI have to be honest about that.\n\n22:11.600 --> 22:17.600\nEven though that's a thing that's only happening in my secret part of my brain,\n\n22:17.600 --> 22:22.600\nI'm not taking any action about that, but when people tweet me and try to be obnoxious\n\n22:22.600 --> 22:25.600\nand say something mean to me to get my attention,\n\n22:25.600 --> 22:34.600\nand then I say, hey, why don't you go fuck yourself? You're a poop face. You're dumb, and you're wrong, and you're an idiot,\n\n22:34.600 --> 22:39.600\nand you're my mate of rubber, and your mom's an idiot.\n\n22:39.600 --> 22:44.600\nAnd then they go, ooh, got a rise out of you, and you're like, yeah, you did.\n\n22:44.600 --> 22:46.600\nFuck, you still eat poop.\n\n22:46.600 --> 22:52.600\nTake your rise out of me and the poop that you eat, and see what a dad's up to.\n\n22:52.600 --> 22:56.600\nI don't know. And they're like, look, man, just kidding, I'm just a big fan.\n\n22:56.600 --> 23:00.600\nI just knew that if I kissed your ass, it wouldn't be, you know, like, that's not how it's like.\n\n23:00.600 --> 23:06.600\nSome people say that, or other people will go like, look, I'm sorry, I'm just not another sycophantic fan person.\n\n23:06.600 --> 23:11.600\nI really want those people to die in a fire.\n\n23:11.600 --> 23:20.600\nI don't really. For the transcript, I'm just trying to put the laughs in the transcript.\n\n23:20.600 --> 23:25.600\nIt's a transcript of a live show with an audience. Put the laughs in.\n\n23:25.600 --> 23:30.600\nThat's important.\n\n23:30.600 --> 23:37.600\nIt's like reading Eminem lyrics on CNN, you know?\n\n23:37.600 --> 23:41.600\nIt's always going to sound bad, man.\n\n23:41.600 --> 23:47.600\nI am not an appealing man.\n\n23:47.600 --> 23:50.600\nShit, shit, shit. I lost my train of thought.\n\n23:50.600 --> 23:55.600\nYou guys don't want me to regain my train of thought because I was on some stupid tangent that was taking forever.\n\n23:55.600 --> 23:59.600\nYou were talking about looking for the negative.\n\n23:59.600 --> 24:01.600\nYes, come, Charlene, yes.\n\n24:01.600 --> 24:07.600\nYes, when I was doing stand-up before I quit, if there was one person standing in the back of the room going like this,\n\n24:07.600 --> 24:09.600\nlike, I can't keep my eye off of them.\n\n24:09.600 --> 24:14.600\nI don't know, when you guys do live gigs, do you pay attention to how people are reacting to you in the back of the room?\n\n24:14.600 --> 24:16.600\nI used to. I just look at my guitar now.\n\n24:16.600 --> 24:21.600\nWe've only played three shows here in LA, but it's been super positive for the most part.\n\n24:21.600 --> 24:24.600\nWhen we were in the Midwest, people fucking hated us.\n\n24:24.600 --> 24:29.600\nPeople just walk out on us, but we're like, everyone has beers and wearing flannel shirts,\n\n24:29.600 --> 24:34.600\nand we have angel wings and leopard print and sparkles, so that makes sense.\n\n24:34.600 --> 24:38.600\nFor the most part, it's been super positive, and then that was kind of the weird thing,\n\n24:38.600 --> 24:41.600\nis this video was kind of showcasing my new band.\n\n24:41.600 --> 24:42.600\nWe're all fired up.\n\n24:42.600 --> 24:43.600\nYeah, check this out, man.\n\n24:43.600 --> 24:48.600\nWe're really happy about it, and then we put it online where, like, slam, you know?\n\n24:48.600 --> 24:52.600\nThe cool thing is that people had such a big reaction to it.\n\n24:52.600 --> 24:53.600\nIt didn't disappear.\n\n24:53.600 --> 25:05.600\nIt's so strange, like, never previously in, like, humanity has a person or a poor little girl.\n\n25:05.600 --> 25:06.600\nLike, had to deal...\n\n25:06.600 --> 25:08.600\nI'm not on my own. I'm not that poor.\n\n25:08.600 --> 25:13.600\nNo one's ever had to deal with that amount of, like, these little, like, I think Duncan\n\n25:13.600 --> 25:17.600\nTrussell calls them moments of novelty, like, these tiny little...\n\n25:17.600 --> 25:22.600\nAnd, like, when they're just, like, constantly coming at you, and it's like, you cannot...\n\n25:22.600 --> 25:27.600\nI don't care who you are, you cannot stop yourself when your phone's buzzing like crazy.\n\n25:27.600 --> 25:30.600\nYou cannot stop yourself from reading it.\n\n25:30.600 --> 25:31.600\nYou just can't.\n\n25:31.600 --> 25:33.600\nI mean, I have been able to now...\n\n25:33.600 --> 25:36.600\nI just don't go to...\n\n25:36.600 --> 25:40.600\nI do it, but that's because I have done this five times now, at least.\n\n25:40.600 --> 25:41.600\nLike, I just...\n\n25:41.600 --> 25:42.600\nIt's always...\n\n25:42.600 --> 25:49.600\nMy 40 years in counting now, just, like, like, God telling me to say stuff.\n\n25:49.600 --> 25:51.600\nEveryone telling me to shut up.\n\n25:51.600 --> 26:00.600\nMe saying, but God said it, and then absolutely regretting saying that.\n\n26:00.600 --> 26:08.600\nI'm just trying to say how I feel, because if I don't say anything, like, I'm no good\n\n26:08.600 --> 26:13.600\nto anybody, and whether it's typing things or saying things.\n\n26:13.600 --> 26:16.600\nBut, like, I've been...\n\n26:16.600 --> 26:23.600\nYeah, anyways, that's a dumb tangent, but I did want to say to you guys because, I mean,\n\n26:23.600 --> 26:28.600\nyou're virtual strangers to me, and I just thought the story was so interesting because\n\n26:28.600 --> 26:32.600\nit kind of, like, it was just a similar thing was happening to me, and it's, like, around\n\n26:32.600 --> 26:34.600\nthe theme of this phenomenon, which is...\n\n26:34.600 --> 26:35.600\nI don't...\n\n26:35.600 --> 26:37.600\nThere's no heroes or villains in the story.\n\n26:37.600 --> 26:38.600\nIt's just...\n\n26:38.600 --> 26:39.600\nIt's like the weather changing.\n\n26:39.600 --> 26:40.600\nIt's like global warming.\n\n26:40.600 --> 26:41.600\nThis is a thing that's happening now.\n\n26:41.600 --> 26:47.600\nWe are all connected to each other, and thank God there's no FCC, like, channeling the whole\n\n26:47.600 --> 26:52.600\nthing through one little tiny thing, because then we'd all just be watching 75-year-old\n\n26:52.600 --> 26:55.600\nDavid Hasselhoff read bedtime stories on the Internet.\n\n26:55.600 --> 27:01.600\nAnd he'd still be in a scandal once in a while, but he'd be trained to handle it or whatever.\n\n27:01.600 --> 27:08.600\nBut, like, thank God the gates are open, and we're all rushing together in this big throng.\n\n27:08.600 --> 27:09.600\nBut just as...\n\n27:09.600 --> 27:14.600\nLike, when you go to a crowded, like, music hall and see a band that has a high tempo,\n\n27:14.600 --> 27:20.600\nthere's always some dick in the audience that starts elbowing, and, you know, like, I...\n\n27:20.600 --> 27:25.600\nThe anonymity and the frustration of not having control over your own life makes tiny parts\n\n27:25.600 --> 27:30.600\nof tiny individuals do these things that, when added all up, create this dandruff that\n\n27:30.600 --> 27:34.600\ncan choke you and make you feel ugly about everything.\n\n27:34.600 --> 27:38.600\nBut, first of all, there's not a single...\n\n27:38.600 --> 27:42.600\nI truly don't believe that there's a single whole individual out there that actually is\n\n27:42.600 --> 27:43.600\nthat ugly.\n\n27:43.600 --> 27:44.600\nI think that...\n\n27:44.600 --> 27:49.600\nI think we just use the Internet as a weird, eyes-wide shut toilet, like, because we can't...\n\n27:49.600 --> 27:52.600\nLike, because it's this syndrome.\n\n27:52.600 --> 27:55.600\nIt's because the more highly visible you are.\n\n27:55.600 --> 27:57.600\nAnd by the way, we're supposed to...\n\n27:57.600 --> 27:59.600\nWe're telling high school kids it gets better.\n\n27:59.600 --> 28:01.600\nLike, are you supposed to tell that to Rebecca Black?\n\n28:01.600 --> 28:03.600\nLike, that it gets better?\n\n28:03.600 --> 28:06.600\nYou're going to have 45-year-old men telling you you're a shitty singer?\n\n28:06.600 --> 28:07.600\nIt gets better?\n\n28:07.600 --> 28:08.600\nYeah.\n\n28:08.600 --> 28:10.600\nShe knows it doesn't get better.\n\n28:10.600 --> 28:12.600\nHopefully, it does get better.\n\n28:12.600 --> 28:15.600\nBut, like, man, I'm all over the place.\n\n28:15.600 --> 28:17.600\nYou learned how to handle it better.\n\n28:17.600 --> 28:18.600\nYou know I didn't.\n\n28:18.600 --> 28:19.600\nNo, I didn't.\n\n28:19.600 --> 28:21.600\nI know, I know.\n\n28:21.600 --> 28:27.600\nBut, what I wanted to say to you guys is I clicked on your thing.\n\n28:27.600 --> 28:28.600\nI watched the video.\n\n28:28.600 --> 28:29.600\nI'm like, oh, cool song.\n\n28:29.600 --> 28:31.600\nSounds like my phone's ringing for a second.\n\n28:31.600 --> 28:32.600\nAwesome idea.\n\n28:32.600 --> 28:41.600\nLike, and then reading the comments, it's like, they were all so pointless to me because I'm\n\n28:41.600 --> 28:43.600\nabsolutely outside the situation.\n\n28:43.600 --> 28:45.600\nThere's nothing personal about it for me.\n\n28:45.600 --> 28:49.600\nLike, I scoured because I wanted to talk to you guys about what's the worst one.\n\n28:49.600 --> 28:57.600\nLike, I can see, I can see that if someone's saying like, stupid idea, bad music, singers,\n\n28:57.600 --> 29:10.600\nugly, voice and face, turn your hat around, stop singing forever and cut yourself in your\n\n29:10.600 --> 29:15.600\nface and it'll look better because your face is worse than a cut face.\n\n29:15.600 --> 29:23.100\nLike, to you, it's like, I can say that and they can laugh because they know it's a joke\n\n29:23.100 --> 29:28.600\nand I know it's a joke to those, like, those concepts.\n\n29:28.600 --> 29:34.600\nYou're seeing it from some anonymous stranger and the only difference is you're projecting\n\n29:34.600 --> 29:39.600\nonto it like, oh, shit, like, what if they really mean that?\n\n29:39.600 --> 29:43.600\nIt's like, they just, they're just in a sad part of their life.\n\n29:43.600 --> 29:48.600\nLike, just having some weird moment of weakness and they don't, none of it's true.\n\n29:48.600 --> 29:49.600\nNone of it means anything.\n\n29:49.600 --> 29:53.600\nThey're literally trying to make you feel exactly how you feel.\n\n29:53.600 --> 29:55.600\nThere's almost an uplifting thing about that.\n\n29:55.600 --> 29:58.600\nIt's still possible for us to touch each other.\n\n29:58.600 --> 30:05.600\nWe're just doing it, we're using glory holes to put, we're putting spears through them.\n\n30:05.600 --> 30:13.600\nIt's a misuse of the technology.\n\n30:13.600 --> 30:25.600\nIt's clear what we should be doing and how we could all benefit.\n\n30:25.600 --> 30:30.600\nThere's multiple levels though of how fucked up it is though because like, I mean, once\n\n30:30.600 --> 30:38.600\nyou've read literally thousands and thousands of people telling you to kill yourself, now\n\n30:38.600 --> 30:41.600\nevery time you read one, it's like, okay, yeah, whatever.\n\n30:41.600 --> 30:45.600\nBut then sometimes you click the user and see, you actually see the person and now\n\n30:45.600 --> 30:48.600\nYouTube shows a photo a lot of times.\n\n30:48.600 --> 30:53.600\nBut that's the part that kind of upsets me because then I see the person and I'm like,\n\n30:53.600 --> 30:59.600\nwhoa, that is a human being and they in their free time are shitting on something that\n\n30:59.600 --> 31:02.600\nI'm doing for fun with my friends.\n\n31:02.600 --> 31:05.600\nBut you know the great thing about that is you can further click on them and see the\n\n31:05.600 --> 31:09.600\ncomments they're leaving and you can see the mental state that they're in.\n\n31:09.600 --> 31:13.600\nSo we picked a couple of them out and we're just like, wow, they're doing, at least it's\n\n31:13.600 --> 31:15.600\nnot just me, but I don't know.\n\n31:15.600 --> 31:17.600\nYou showed me because I was upset.\n\n31:17.600 --> 31:23.600\nI mean, it's like any type of creative profession, like as you know, the last thing you need\n\n31:23.600 --> 31:28.600\nis someone saying stop because everyone along the way in our lives has said fucking stop.\n\n31:28.600 --> 31:30.600\nYeah, everything in your head says stop.\n\n31:30.600 --> 31:31.600\nExactly.\n\n31:31.600 --> 31:34.600\nYou don't need another reason to be more critical of yourself.\n\n31:34.600 --> 31:40.600\nWell, you guys do me a huge, huge favor and all of society a huge favor and use the emotional\n\n31:40.600 --> 31:46.600\nexperience of being told to stop by people that don't really mean stop to create more\n\n31:46.600 --> 31:51.600\nsongs about how it feels to be told to stop or something.\n\n31:51.600 --> 31:56.600\nBecause if enough of us start doing that, if enough of us make humanity boring enough\n\n31:56.600 --> 32:03.600\nto other people, like maybe with the parts of us that hate ourselves, I think that a\n\n32:03.600 --> 32:08.600\nlot of us have to get up in the morning and go to bed at night never having told the truth.\n\n32:08.600 --> 32:12.600\nAnd I think that a lot of times it's not their fault either.\n\n32:12.600 --> 32:17.600\nAnd I think that you guys and me, we're in the unique position to be able to, you know,\n\n32:17.600 --> 32:21.600\nwe can tell the truth about how we feel and just say weird shit and let the chips fall\n\n32:21.600 --> 32:22.600\nwhere they may.\n\n32:22.600 --> 32:30.600\nAnd we kind of have to keep doing it so otherwise like if we stop, then 9-Eleven happens again.\n\n32:30.600 --> 32:34.600\nAnd you can quote me on that.\n\n32:34.600 --> 32:36.600\nVulture.com.\n\n32:36.600 --> 32:40.600\nDo you guys have anything to promote or anything?\n\n32:40.600 --> 32:42.600\nYou want anyone to know about anything you're doing?\n\n32:42.600 --> 32:46.600\nYou're just plucking your little guitars and singing your hearts out.\n\n32:46.600 --> 32:47.600\nYeah.\n\n32:47.600 --> 32:50.600\nYou can check out our YouTube channel.\n\n32:50.600 --> 32:51.600\nI think it's pretty cool.\n\n32:51.600 --> 32:52.600\nYou can go to grocerybag.tv.\n\n32:52.600 --> 32:53.600\nMaybe YouTube channel.\n\n32:53.600 --> 32:55.600\nWe do these things called computer shows.\n\n32:55.600 --> 32:56.600\nYeah.\n\n32:56.600 --> 32:57.600\nAnd soundgrocerbag.tv.\n\n32:57.600 --> 32:58.600\nAll right.\n\n32:58.600 --> 32:59.600\nAwesome.\n\n32:59.600 --> 33:00.600\nMars Argo.\n\n33:00.600 --> 33:01.600\nThank you for coming by.\n\n33:01.600 --> 33:02.600\nThank you.\n\n33:02.600 --> 33:03.600\nThank you for having us.\n\n33:03.600 --> 33:15.600\nIt's a good song.\n\n33:15.600 --> 33:18.600\nI like the refrain.\n\n33:18.600 --> 33:20.600\nI like her voice.\n\n33:20.600 --> 33:29.600\nYou know, you were not born yet, but in the 90s, I was a, as you have discovered, I was\n\n33:29.600 --> 33:34.600\na big fan of the female kind of very emotional, passionate Tonya Donnelly's.\n\n33:34.600 --> 33:38.600\nI like when you touch your chest as if to mind breath.\n\n33:38.600 --> 33:41.600\nI am miming passion coming out.\n\n33:41.600 --> 33:43.600\nI'm not miming boobs.\n\n33:43.600 --> 33:49.600\nI'm a big fan of Tonya Donnelly throwing muses and toriemas.\n\n33:49.600 --> 33:52.600\nI'm just cupping my breasts.\n\n33:52.600 --> 33:54.600\nI like pain.\n\n33:54.600 --> 33:55.600\nI like...\n\n33:55.600 --> 33:57.600\nYou like feminine pain?\n\n33:57.600 --> 33:58.600\nOh, God.\n\n33:58.600 --> 33:59.600\nYes.\n\n33:59.600 --> 34:00.600\nOh, God.\n\n34:00.600 --> 34:01.600\nNo, no, no.\n\n34:01.600 --> 34:02.600\nYes.\n\n34:02.600 --> 34:03.600\nGood one.\n\n34:03.600 --> 34:04.600\nNice.\n\n34:04.600 --> 34:05.600\nDon't worry.\n\n34:05.600 --> 34:06.600\nI'll write a letter apologizing for you.\n\n34:06.600 --> 34:16.600\nIt's pretty hard for a guy to have my number vocally in a song I find.\n\n34:16.600 --> 34:17.600\nYeah.\n\n34:17.600 --> 34:22.960\nI like being upstairs, working on something, and hearing the cranberries echo throughout\n\n34:22.960 --> 34:27.600\nthe house, and come down and see you in a bubble bath.\n\n34:27.600 --> 34:29.600\nIt's nice.\n\n34:29.600 --> 34:32.600\nYou are very sensitive.\n\n34:32.600 --> 34:34.600\nYou're not very macho at all.\n\n34:34.600 --> 34:36.600\nIt's nice.\n\n34:36.600 --> 34:51.600\nIt's like having a sister.\n\n34:51.600 --> 34:54.600\nTo that, it is funny to think about our gender roles in our relationship.\n\n34:54.600 --> 34:57.600\nOur gender roles?\n\n34:57.600 --> 34:58.600\nOur gender roles.\n\n34:58.600 --> 34:59.600\nOh, gender roles.\n\n34:59.600 --> 35:00.600\nOur roles.\n\n35:00.600 --> 35:02.600\nI'm kind of the handyman.\n\n35:02.600 --> 35:09.600\nWell, I took off that door that one time while you sat at the bar and told me I couldn't.\n\n35:09.600 --> 35:11.600\nBecause it was as you said, a two-man job.\n\n35:11.600 --> 35:15.600\nSo I guess I'm sometimes pretty manly.\n\n35:15.600 --> 35:16.600\nYeah, yeah.\n\n35:16.600 --> 35:20.600\nI'm as manly as two men by your definition.\n\n35:20.600 --> 35:22.600\nI did a two-man job.\n\n35:22.600 --> 35:24.600\nI was really impressed by that.\n\n35:24.600 --> 35:28.600\nAlso really impressed by the doggie gate that you put at the top of the stairs.\n\n35:28.600 --> 35:29.600\nThank you.\n\n35:29.600 --> 35:30.600\nYeah.\n\n35:30.600 --> 35:33.600\nIt was a big sheet of instructions that came with that.\n\n35:33.600 --> 35:35.600\nDid you look at them?\n\n35:35.600 --> 35:36.600\nYeah, of course not.\n\n35:36.600 --> 35:37.600\nI followed them.\n\n35:37.600 --> 35:38.600\nYeah, that's so nice.\n\n35:38.600 --> 35:46.600\nYou know, first I issued a press release about how the company that made the doggie gate was a bunch of blood-sucking rich assholes.\n\n35:46.600 --> 35:52.600\nBut then one of them emailed me and said his feelings were hurt, so I installed the doggie gate.\n\n35:52.600 --> 35:57.600\nI eventually do what I'm supposed to do, and humanity benefits.\n\n35:57.600 --> 35:58.600\nI like that.\n\n35:58.600 --> 35:59.600\nI like that you read the directions.\n\n35:59.600 --> 36:07.600\nI had a couple handymen over to the house when you haven't been there.\n\n36:07.600 --> 36:11.600\nTo set up different things around the house, and they all...\n\n36:11.600 --> 36:15.600\nThere have been like three of them.\n\n36:15.600 --> 36:19.600\nThere was Chad, Brock, and Nick.\n\n36:19.600 --> 36:20.600\nWell, all those...\n\n36:20.600 --> 36:21.600\nJoel.\n\n36:21.600 --> 36:23.600\nJoel? Why Joel?\n\n36:23.600 --> 36:25.600\nOh, Joel McHale?\n\n36:25.600 --> 36:26.600\nThat's interesting.\n\n36:26.600 --> 36:31.600\nI think that guy just has a similar fantasy of just calling out.\n\n36:31.600 --> 36:36.600\nHe's just like, make this perfect for me.\n\n36:36.600 --> 36:43.600\nMake it my high school math teacher.\n\n36:43.600 --> 36:44.600\nDon't stop.\n\n36:44.600 --> 36:47.600\nDon't stop just short of what I wrote.\n\n36:47.600 --> 36:48.600\nThese are TaskRabbit.\n\n36:48.600 --> 36:51.600\nDoes anyone use TaskRabbit or know what TaskRabbit is?\n\n36:51.600 --> 36:52.600\nYes.\n\n36:52.600 --> 36:57.600\nTaskRabbit is the grub hub of indentured servitude.\n\n36:57.600 --> 37:00.600\nWell, and I've had some guys come over and help me put together furniture and stuff,\n\n37:00.600 --> 37:03.600\nand each and every one of them has made a show out of like,\n\n37:03.600 --> 37:05.600\nthese directions, no good.\n\n37:05.600 --> 37:06.600\nAnd throwing them to the side.\n\n37:06.600 --> 37:08.600\nI'm like, all right, well...\n\n37:08.600 --> 37:09.600\nI mean, I agree.\n\n37:09.600 --> 37:11.600\nThey're very confusing, but those guys are above them.\n\n37:11.600 --> 37:12.600\nI'm below them.\n\n37:12.600 --> 37:15.600\nI'm like, these directions be no good.\n\n37:15.600 --> 37:21.600\nWell, you know, John the handyman, I asked him if he could take your gate off that you installed,\n\n37:21.600 --> 37:23.600\nand he was working on it for like a half hour.\n\n37:23.600 --> 37:25.600\nHe's like, I don't know how he did it, but I cannot get it off.\n\n37:25.600 --> 37:27.600\nHe said, well, he's the one that's a community fan, right?\n\n37:27.600 --> 37:29.600\nHe was probably like, did Dan Harmon install this gate?\n\n37:29.600 --> 37:31.600\nI'm sorry, I can't.\n\n37:35.600 --> 37:37.600\nThere's something about it.\n\n37:37.600 --> 37:39.600\nI just like the way it feels.\n\n37:39.600 --> 37:41.600\nIt has more heart.\n\n37:44.600 --> 37:45.600\nOh my God.\n\n37:45.600 --> 37:47.600\nDan, do you know what time it is?\n\n37:47.600 --> 37:49.600\nIt's...\n\n37:49.600 --> 37:51.600\nIt's...\n\n37:53.600 --> 37:55.600\n8.52.\n\n37:59.600 --> 38:02.600\nIt's game corner time.\n\n38:04.600 --> 38:06.600\nCan we get Kumail Nashiani on the stage?\n\n38:06.600 --> 38:08.600\nKumail.\n\n38:10.600 --> 38:14.600\nKumail Hills from beautiful Pakistan, where...\n\n38:14.600 --> 38:16.600\nKumail call.\n\n38:16.600 --> 38:17.600\nWhat did you just say?\n\n38:17.600 --> 38:19.600\nKumail call?\n\n38:19.600 --> 38:21.600\nI like that.\n\n38:21.600 --> 38:22.600\nI've never heard that.\n\n38:22.600 --> 38:25.600\nI've heard you've got Kumail, which...\n\n38:25.600 --> 38:26.600\nThat's better.\n\n38:26.600 --> 38:27.600\nIt's pretty great.\n\n38:27.600 --> 38:29.600\nHave you ever heard you had me at Kumail?\n\n38:29.600 --> 38:30.600\nThat doesn't make any sense.\n\n38:30.600 --> 38:31.600\nNo.\n\n38:31.600 --> 38:32.600\nNo.\n\n38:32.600 --> 38:33.600\nNo, go ahead, make my Kumail.\n\n38:33.600 --> 38:34.600\nI haven't heard that.\n\n38:34.600 --> 38:36.600\nYou're going off the Kumail.\n\n38:36.600 --> 38:38.600\nGet off my Kumail plane?\n\n38:38.600 --> 38:39.600\nNope.\n\n38:39.600 --> 38:41.600\nGet off my Kumail plane.\n\n38:41.600 --> 38:43.600\nWe're going to need a bigger Kumail boat?\n\n38:43.600 --> 38:45.600\nYeah, that I have heard.\n\n38:45.600 --> 38:46.600\nWeird.\n\n38:46.600 --> 38:48.600\nI was in a weird job situation.\n\n38:48.600 --> 38:50.600\nWhen you're sick, do you have a Kumailant?\n\n38:50.600 --> 38:52.600\nA Kumail?\n\n38:52.600 --> 38:54.600\nWelcome to the game!\n\n38:56.600 --> 38:58.600\nI want to say a couple things, but should we do the game first?\n\n38:58.600 --> 39:00.600\nNo, you can say a couple things.\n\n39:00.600 --> 39:03.600\nDo you mind if I put some music underneath it?\n\n39:03.600 --> 39:04.600\nNo, I shouldn't.\n\n39:04.600 --> 39:05.600\nGo ahead.\n\n39:05.600 --> 39:08.600\nI wanted to read this because, first of all, can I say something, Dan?\n\n39:08.600 --> 39:10.600\nYou're talking about Steve Levitan being handsome.\n\n39:10.600 --> 39:12.600\nHe's a very handsome man.\n\n39:12.600 --> 39:14.600\nYou look fucking great these days.\n\n39:14.600 --> 39:16.600\nThanks, buddy.\n\n39:16.600 --> 39:22.600\nIt looks like a fun top gun vibe to it.\n\n39:22.600 --> 39:29.600\nI finally learned after 40 years that I need to never just wear a t-shirt because my posture is so bad.\n\n39:29.600 --> 39:32.600\nI have this weird...\n\n39:32.600 --> 39:34.600\nI'm like a circus bear.\n\n39:34.600 --> 39:37.600\nEspecially viewed in profile.\n\n39:37.600 --> 39:39.600\nI really need to...\n\n39:39.600 --> 39:40.600\nBut go on.\n\n39:40.600 --> 39:41.600\nBut no.\n\n39:41.600 --> 39:42.600\nYou look great.\n\n39:42.600 --> 39:44.600\nYou're Peter Jackson-ing right now.\n\n39:46.600 --> 39:48.600\nThat's a good thing.\n\n39:48.600 --> 39:50.600\nI mean, you know, because he...\n\n39:50.600 --> 39:52.600\nHe shot in New Zealand.\n\n39:52.600 --> 39:54.600\nYeah, and now he wears shoes and everything.\n\n39:56.600 --> 39:59.600\nIt was a long time where he wasn't wearing shoes.\n\n39:59.600 --> 40:00.600\nI told you this.\n\n40:00.600 --> 40:08.600\nI think I told the story on this show when I went to Comic-Con and the workaholics guys, very funny guys,\n\n40:08.600 --> 40:16.600\nI was talking to them for a while and then people were gathered around us and they walked away after a while.\n\n40:16.600 --> 40:18.600\nYou know, it's like conversations kind of ebb and flow.\n\n40:18.600 --> 40:23.600\nThey left the conversation circle and I was stuck with some other people.\n\n40:23.600 --> 40:32.600\nAnd this one guy just really enamored with me and started asking me more and more specific questions about when I shoot stuff,\n\n40:32.600 --> 40:39.600\nlike what I'm thinking and I was really flattered by it and like, well, you know, I just try, hey, at the end of the day, it's just stuff, you know?\n\n40:39.600 --> 40:43.600\nAnd then he started asking about New Zealand and...\n\n40:43.600 --> 40:45.600\nOh, no!\n\n40:49.600 --> 40:52.600\nAnd I went like, I've never been to New Zealand and he went like, yeah, you have.\n\n40:52.600 --> 40:54.600\nYou have an American accent.\n\n40:56.600 --> 40:57.600\nSo many clues.\n\n40:57.600 --> 41:03.600\nAnd he went like, you've never been to New Zealand.\n\n41:03.600 --> 41:04.600\nAnd I was like, no.\n\n41:04.600 --> 41:08.600\nAnd then he looked and his face like contorted into anger.\n\n41:08.600 --> 41:16.600\nI felt at me, anger at me, pointed at the giggling workaholic guys on the other side of the party.\n\n41:16.600 --> 41:17.600\nOh!\n\n41:17.600 --> 41:26.600\nThose guys told me you were Peter Jackson, which is, I mean, I'm not usually a fan of practical joke.\n\n41:26.600 --> 41:27.600\nThat's a good one.\n\n41:27.600 --> 41:29.600\nThat's funny shit, man.\n\n41:29.600 --> 41:31.600\nI will forever remember them.\n\n41:31.600 --> 41:32.600\nYeah.\n\n41:32.600 --> 41:43.600\nThe furniture thing, I'm like not handy at all also, but I have this thing, like, if I get started on something, Emily's not handy either, so we both are not handy.\n\n41:43.600 --> 41:45.600\nI'm not going to hurt anyone.\n\n41:45.600 --> 41:49.600\nNo, no, no, I was going to, whatever, what's it, something rabbits? What are they called?\n\n41:49.600 --> 41:50.600\nThe people that come in?\n\n41:50.600 --> 41:51.600\nOh, the TaskRabbit.\n\n41:51.600 --> 41:53.600\nThe Jowls and the Chads of the World?\n\n41:53.600 --> 41:55.600\nYes, Jowl, Chad, Nick.\n\n41:55.600 --> 42:02.600\nSo I got this, we got this awesome desk and put it together and I was like, I'm going to fucking finish this today.\n\n42:02.600 --> 42:07.600\nAnd I got so like worked up trying to finish this. This is completely true.\n\n42:07.600 --> 42:18.600\nEmily walked in two hours later and I was completely naked, sweating from everywhere, just like punching a board.\n\n42:18.600 --> 42:27.600\nBecause I got so, I'm like, I'm physically bigger than it, I should be able to have power over it.\n\n42:27.600 --> 42:32.600\nI did that too, I was trying to move a chair through a door and that's why I got in this big play with Eric.\n\n42:32.600 --> 42:33.600\nOh my god.\n\n42:33.600 --> 42:36.600\nHe was like, that's a two-man job, you need to take that door off, that's a two-man job.\n\n42:36.600 --> 42:38.600\nAnd I was like, you know, I just got back.\n\n42:38.600 --> 42:39.600\nThat's like you're like, you know.\n\n42:39.600 --> 42:44.600\nI was practically naked too, because you're just sweating and you just, I was like, one thing I can't control, it's stupid clothes.\n\n42:44.600 --> 42:46.600\nYeah.\n\n42:46.600 --> 42:52.600\nYeah, you're like, do you two-man job is like Marty McFly's chicken, you know.\n\n42:52.600 --> 42:54.600\nLike if you hear two-man job.\n\n42:54.600 --> 42:56.600\nGod damn it, can I tell you, this is eating away at me.\n\n42:56.600 --> 43:01.600\nOkay, I took the closet door off the hinges.\n\n43:01.600 --> 43:03.600\nIt was lighter and easier to get off.\n\n43:03.600 --> 43:09.600\nIt was a two-man job, the door that you said.\n\n43:09.600 --> 43:15.600\nI figured out a different door I could take off that was not so much a two-man job.\n\n43:15.600 --> 43:20.600\nBut the principle of the thing is, you didn't believe in me.\n\n43:20.600 --> 43:33.600\nYou know what, I guess turns out coming clean is a one-man job.\n\n43:33.600 --> 43:41.600\nI was literally about to say, he moved a very heavy door and put it back on its hinges perfectly, which is amazing.\n\n43:41.600 --> 43:45.600\nBut you know what, he figured out how to get around it.\n\n43:45.600 --> 43:47.600\nAnd isn't that just as important?\n\n43:47.600 --> 43:49.600\nHe also figured out how to.\n\n43:49.600 --> 43:53.600\nThere's going to be the guy with the eye patch that's creepy and has like fish tanks full of heads and stuff.\n\n43:53.600 --> 43:57.600\nYou want to stick with the old, who am I?\n\n43:57.600 --> 43:59.600\nI think I'm the old man that lost his leg.\n\n43:59.600 --> 44:05.600\nI have something to say about the handyman, Nick and Joel.\n\n44:05.600 --> 44:10.600\nI have something to tell you about all those nanny cams.\n\n44:10.600 --> 44:14.600\nThat's why we're getting free labor.\n\n44:14.600 --> 44:18.600\nThis whole thing, everyone's winning.\n\n44:18.600 --> 44:26.600\nI was going to say, you guys were talking about feedback online and I've talked about how I always get racist stuff on Twitter.\n\n44:26.600 --> 44:30.600\nAnd the thing that a lot of people say, I think I've mentioned it here, people say, go back to India.\n\n44:30.600 --> 44:34.600\nAnd I always say, I've never been there, I'm not Indian.\n\n44:34.600 --> 44:38.600\nAre you just wishing an awesome vacation for me?\n\n44:38.600 --> 44:42.600\nYeah.\n\n44:42.600 --> 44:46.600\nBut this one, I want to read this one tweet I got yesterday because I was tweeting about Paula Deen.\n\n44:46.600 --> 44:50.600\nI'm sorry, why do they want you to go back to India?\n\n44:50.600 --> 44:54.600\nDo they want your job that you're taking?\n\n44:54.600 --> 44:56.600\nAre you welding cars?\n\n44:56.600 --> 45:00.600\nIf I say anything political, they'll be like, go back to India.\n\n45:00.600 --> 45:04.600\nSo yesterday I was tweeting about Paula Deen.\n\n45:04.600 --> 45:08.600\nWell, just from my picture, they were like, all right, that's what an Indian guy looks like.\n\n45:08.600 --> 45:12.600\nThat is what it is. I'm very easily Google-able.\n\n45:12.600 --> 45:16.600\nThere's not many other Kumail Nanjianis who are from India to confuse them.\n\n45:16.600 --> 45:20.600\nI'm just saying, if you're being racist, fucking be accurate.\n\n45:20.600 --> 45:22.600\nYeah.\n\n45:22.600 --> 45:28.600\nBut I got this one because I was tweeting about Paula Deen yesterday because I genuinely think she's a bad person.\n\n45:28.600 --> 45:34.600\nI want to read this because it's the most densely racist thing that I've ever read.\n\n45:34.600 --> 45:37.600\nIt's so few letters. This is what he says.\n\n45:37.600 --> 45:39.600\nI was tweeting about her being racist and he says,\n\n45:39.600 --> 45:44.600\nunfortunate, but every race has rampant racism per meeting their cultures.\n\n45:44.600 --> 45:47.600\nNow, this sentence is my favorite. This is what he says.\n\n45:47.600 --> 45:51.600\nIndians are very racist to others.\n\n45:51.600 --> 45:54.600\nI'll tell you why I love this.\n\n45:54.600 --> 45:56.600\nOne, he calls me Indian when I'm Pakistani.\n\n45:56.600 --> 45:59.600\nSo already, the first word, he's already racist.\n\n45:59.600 --> 46:08.600\nAlso, if the purest form of racism is attributing a characteristic to a race because there are certain race.\n\n46:08.600 --> 46:17.600\nSo him saying Indians are very racist to others, he's being purely racist while using the word racist.\n\n46:17.600 --> 46:20.600\nIt's like a mobius strip of racism.\n\n46:20.600 --> 46:22.600\nHe's the Charlie Kaufman of racism.\n\n46:22.600 --> 46:25.600\nYeah. It's so good.\n\n46:25.600 --> 46:33.600\nI do think a lot of problems could be solved if we just decide whether it's true or not,\n\n46:33.600 --> 46:42.600\nbut let's just break the cycle and just say, okay, white people are more racist genetically.\n\n46:42.600 --> 46:48.600\nI just stopped the conversation, just go, okay, all right, all right, we found the problem.\n\n46:48.600 --> 46:52.600\nWhite people have a gene for racism and then we can all go,\n\n46:52.600 --> 46:58.600\nbecause even if that's not true, we can use that as an excuse to just stop the cycle,\n\n46:58.600 --> 47:05.600\nlike the weird spiraling argument because the problem is like a 14-year-old white girl in line at the mall\n\n47:05.600 --> 47:08.600\nthat has some weird culture clash moment.\n\n47:08.600 --> 47:17.600\nShe's 14. She doesn't have the geopolitical fucking backbone and the experience to deal with all this stuff.\n\n47:17.600 --> 47:21.600\nShe's going to say something equally weird and stuff, but she's white.\n\n47:21.600 --> 47:26.600\nSo she's going to say something horribly racist in defense of her ego, which all 14-year-olds have.\n\n47:26.600 --> 47:32.600\nSo if we all just passed a law that said, okay, we decided, we found it, we found the racist gene.\n\n47:32.600 --> 47:33.600\nWhite people have it.\n\n47:33.600 --> 47:36.600\nAnd you're going to be like, that's our struggle, white people struggle.\n\n47:36.600 --> 47:39.600\nYeah, it's hard. It's hard to be racist.\n\n47:39.600 --> 47:41.600\nWe have to put our comment.\n\n47:41.600 --> 47:45.600\nAnd you're going to be like, it's like your sickle selenemia. See, we're doing it again.\n\n47:45.600 --> 47:49.600\nSee, you get it. You get it, yes. It would all solve itself.\n\n47:49.600 --> 47:54.600\nYou know how you smell like curry? See, we can't help it.\n\n47:54.600 --> 48:00.600\nBecause you know what we're doing right now? We're doing almost the opposite with the diversity movement.\n\n48:00.600 --> 48:02.600\nAnd please don't misinterpret this.\n\n48:02.600 --> 48:05.600\nI think, for instance, NBC's diversity program, I've said many, many times.\n\n48:05.600 --> 48:08.600\nI get so many emails from them and I never signed up for it.\n\n48:08.600 --> 48:10.600\nI don't know how this happened.\n\n48:10.600 --> 48:19.600\nIt's okay. I think that pro-action in a climate where obviously there is a long-standing momentum of things not getting done.\n\n48:19.600 --> 48:26.600\nI don't think that scientifically this thing's better than the other, but I think doing anything at all is better than doing nothing.\n\n48:26.600 --> 48:28.600\nAnd so I want to be very clear about that.\n\n48:28.600 --> 48:31.600\nI'm not one of these people that's like, uh, affirmative action is reverse racism.\n\n48:31.600 --> 48:33.600\nIt's dumb, dumb, dumb.\n\n48:33.600 --> 48:36.600\nBut I just want to point out one thing.\n\n48:36.600 --> 48:39.600\nYou're not saying affirmative action is dumb. You're saying that saying that is dumb.\n\n48:39.600 --> 48:42.600\nYes. Thank you for being here.\n\n48:42.600 --> 48:43.600\nThank you.\n\n48:43.600 --> 48:46.600\nCan you just walk around with me?\n\n48:46.600 --> 48:49.600\nI was going to say in a backpack, but then people would go,\n\n48:49.600 --> 48:53.600\nDan Harmon tells a Pakistani guy to be in his backpack.\n\n48:53.600 --> 48:55.600\nHere's the transcript.\n\n48:55.600 --> 48:57.600\nHe gave me three wishes.\n\n49:00.600 --> 49:03.600\nI wish for a thousand Pakistanis.\n\n49:05.600 --> 49:08.600\nThat's my white jean. I'm inscrubulous.\n\n49:08.600 --> 49:14.600\nBecause I can see the quote from that would be, Affirmative action ellipses, dumb, dumb, dumb.\n\n49:14.600 --> 49:16.600\nYeah, yeah, yeah. Of course. No, no, no, no.\n\n49:16.600 --> 49:24.600\nI'm not one of those libertarian kind of white guys that's like, like, uh, I don't think that\n\n49:24.600 --> 49:36.600\nSpock-like logic in the face of a huge legacy and momentum of disproportionality in certain job spaces is the solution.\n\n49:36.600 --> 49:40.600\nI think that some of the solutions are not going to be logical.\n\n49:40.600 --> 49:45.600\nThey're going to be like, everybody stand on this side of the boat, like to try to counteract some of this stuff.\n\n49:45.600 --> 49:56.600\nSo that being said, I just wanted to have what make the coy cutesy observation that I think the driving force behind the concept of diversity,\n\n49:56.600 --> 50:02.600\nlike the diversity movement, if you could call it that, like, is it me or is there like,\n\n50:02.600 --> 50:09.600\nis there a way to interpret all of this, like a subtle implication is that only white people have the power to end racism?\n\n50:09.600 --> 50:15.600\nWell, I mean, here's why that is sort of a thing that's implied is because white people,\n\n50:15.600 --> 50:21.600\nbecause racism is all about, and all bigotry, it's about sort of power differentials, right?\n\n50:21.600 --> 50:29.600\nAnd so if I, that's why, you know, like a black person being racist against a white person is not as harmful, really,\n\n50:29.600 --> 50:32.600\nas a white person being racist against a black person because white people have power.\n\n50:32.600 --> 50:41.600\nSo because white people in America have the power, that's why it's usually sort of not the job of white people,\n\n50:41.600 --> 50:44.600\nbut they're the ones who I think in effect, the most change.\n\n50:44.600 --> 50:46.600\nYeah, exactly.\n\n50:46.600 --> 50:51.600\nAnd right now, it's like a little in the absence of just say, yeah, maybe it's cartoonish.\n\n50:51.600 --> 50:52.600\nI'm probably not being serious.\n\n50:52.600 --> 50:57.600\nBut honestly, if some scientist, if a scientist can pretend that Brontosaurus has existed,\n\n50:57.600 --> 51:02.600\nand it's just like, like one scientist got like, I found the racism gene.\n\n51:02.600 --> 51:05.600\nI found a gene in the Caucasoid bloodstream.\n\n51:05.600 --> 51:06.600\nYeah.\n\n51:06.600 --> 51:09.600\nIt just, it makes you just a tad more racist.\n\n51:09.600 --> 51:10.600\nYeah.\n\n51:10.600 --> 51:20.600\nSo you, in order to counteract it, you have to, you have to force your poor, poor racist white blood to be a little less racist.\n\n51:20.600 --> 51:22.600\nIt's a struggle that you have.\n\n51:22.600 --> 51:24.600\nYeah, I'm beating a dead horse, but anyway.\n\n51:24.600 --> 51:25.600\nI think that's good.\n\n51:25.600 --> 51:26.600\nI like that idea.\n\n51:26.600 --> 51:31.600\nWe should get one guy, have proof, and then his lab burns down and he dies.\n\n51:31.600 --> 51:35.600\nAnd he's the sacrifice for ending racism.\n\n51:35.600 --> 51:37.600\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n51:37.600 --> 51:39.600\nThis would be a great, like, yeah, Pelican brief kind of.\n\n51:39.600 --> 51:40.600\nHe's done it.\n\n51:40.600 --> 51:41.600\nThanks for coming to Harmontown.\n\n51:41.600 --> 51:42.600\nAll right.\n\n51:42.600 --> 51:43.600\nLet's, let's, let's play.\n\n51:43.600 --> 51:44.600\nWhat's this game?\n\n51:44.600 --> 51:45.600\nYeah, I'm excited.\n\n51:45.600 --> 51:46.600\nGame quarter.\n\n51:46.600 --> 51:52.600\nAaron has a gene for game playing.\n\n51:52.600 --> 51:56.600\nCan I bring a Spencer to the stage, please?\n\n51:56.600 --> 51:57.600\nSpencer.\n\n51:57.600 --> 51:58.600\nBrendan.\n\n51:58.600 --> 52:08.600\nHailing from the city near Los Angeles.\n\n52:08.600 --> 52:11.600\nSpencer's favorite time is bedtime.\n\n52:11.600 --> 52:12.600\nWhat?\n\n52:12.600 --> 52:16.600\nThat timing was perfect.\n\n52:16.600 --> 52:17.600\nIt was amazing.\n\n52:17.600 --> 52:18.600\nAll right.\n\n52:18.600 --> 52:20.600\nSo we're going to play, we're going to play a little game.\n\n52:20.600 --> 52:23.600\nIt's going to be Dan against Kumail.\n\n52:23.600 --> 52:27.600\nAnd it's not necessary to this game, but it may enhance it.\n\n52:27.600 --> 52:30.600\nCan I have Adam Goldberg come to the stage?\n\n52:30.600 --> 52:32.600\nWait, his brother is going to enhance something?\n\n52:32.600 --> 52:33.600\nControversial figure, Adam Goldberg.\n\n52:33.600 --> 52:40.600\nNow I've heard everything.\n\n52:40.600 --> 52:41.600\nHow's it going?\n\n52:41.600 --> 52:42.600\nHow do you do it, Adam?\n\n52:42.600 --> 52:43.600\nThank you.\n\n52:43.600 --> 52:44.600\nThank you, Adam.\n\n52:44.600 --> 52:46.600\nI always want to not, you know, and then you say something nice.\n\n52:46.600 --> 52:48.600\nI'm like, all right, thanks.\n\n52:48.600 --> 52:53.600\nSo this last week was Spencer's first week as your assistant.\n\n52:53.600 --> 52:54.600\nAll right, yeah.\n\n52:54.600 --> 52:56.600\nWhich I know.\n\n52:56.600 --> 52:58.600\nAnd he's amazing.\n\n52:58.600 --> 52:59.600\nHe's great.\n\n52:59.600 --> 53:03.600\nYeah, I've heard from both sides that it's going really well.\n\n53:03.600 --> 53:06.600\nSpencer's having a great time and Spencer's doing great.\n\n53:06.600 --> 53:13.600\nSpencer sits in the writer's room and it stares at me like a falcon.\n\n53:13.600 --> 53:18.600\nAnd at one point I needed to sit down two times as this happened.\n\n53:18.600 --> 53:19.600\nYeah, two.\n\n53:19.600 --> 53:21.600\nBecause I'm standing there talking to the writers.\n\n53:21.600 --> 53:23.600\nA huge writing staff this year.\n\n53:23.600 --> 53:25.600\nAnd I was like, there's no chair.\n\n53:25.600 --> 53:30.600\nAnd I kind of became conscious of my need for my fat butt to be supported by something.\n\n53:30.600 --> 53:35.600\nAnd this Viking man bounded up with a heavy chair and plopped it down.\n\n53:35.600 --> 53:37.600\nThe writers were really impressed.\n\n53:37.600 --> 53:39.600\nThey applauded.\n\n53:39.600 --> 53:40.600\nYeah, they did.\n\n53:40.600 --> 53:41.600\nThey applauded.\n\n53:41.600 --> 53:46.600\nThat's assisting someone when you get applause for it.\n\n53:46.600 --> 53:51.600\nSo it sounds like Spencer knows you very well and is anticipating your whims.\n\n53:51.600 --> 53:54.600\nBut how well do you know Spencer?\n\n53:54.600 --> 53:55.600\nWe're going to play a little game.\n\n53:55.600 --> 53:59.600\nNo.\n\n53:59.600 --> 54:01.600\nWe're in my world to mount.\n\n54:01.600 --> 54:03.600\nWe're going to play a little.\n\n54:03.600 --> 54:07.600\nAnd Adam, for those of you who don't know, if you're just listening to this podcast for the first time,\n\n54:07.600 --> 54:10.600\nor if you're here from Variety or The Hollywood Reporter,\n\n54:10.600 --> 54:17.600\nAdam Goldberg is a controversial, Harmontown audience member, tenacious...\n\n54:17.600 --> 54:18.600\nLightning Rod.\n\n54:18.600 --> 54:20.600\nLightning Rod.\n\n54:20.600 --> 54:21.600\nLightning Rod.\n\n54:21.600 --> 54:29.600\nLightning Rod is weird because it's not the Rod's fault that it's happening.\n\n54:29.600 --> 54:34.600\nThe Rod is not bringing it upon itself.\n\n54:34.600 --> 54:40.600\nThe man I really don't like when other men refer to me as the Rod.\n\n54:40.600 --> 54:41.600\nWhatever.\n\n54:41.600 --> 54:45.600\nSo we're going to...\n\n54:45.600 --> 54:50.600\nWe're going to play a little game called Spencer or Adam.\n\n54:50.600 --> 54:51.600\nOh, boy.\n\n54:51.600 --> 54:54.600\nAll right.\n\n54:54.600 --> 54:57.600\nI will just say there was a guy when we were handing out cupcakes.\n\n54:57.600 --> 55:02.600\nThere was a guy that was so obviously an entertainment blogger that had never been here before.\n\n55:02.600 --> 55:04.600\nThere was this guy that just had this look.\n\n55:04.600 --> 55:06.600\nI'm really curious if he was or if he's just...\n\n55:06.600 --> 55:07.600\nOh, tonight?\n\n55:07.600 --> 55:08.600\nYeah.\n\n55:08.600 --> 55:09.600\nIt just looks so out of place.\n\n55:09.600 --> 55:12.600\nIt was so like just camping out here.\n\n55:12.600 --> 55:13.600\nLike, well...\n\n55:13.600 --> 55:14.600\nHey, Superman.\n\n55:14.600 --> 55:15.600\nThat's something I like.\n\n55:15.600 --> 55:17.600\nHarmontown.\n\n55:17.600 --> 55:21.600\nAll right.\n\n55:21.600 --> 55:22.600\nOkay.\n\n55:22.600 --> 55:24.600\nSo this is...\n\n55:24.600 --> 55:30.600\nI asked both Spencer and Adam the same series of questions.\n\n55:30.600 --> 55:34.600\nAnd what I'm going to do is I'm going to present a question and the answer.\n\n55:34.600 --> 55:39.600\nAnd Camille and Dan, you're going to say if it's Spencer or if it's Adam.\n\n55:39.600 --> 55:42.600\nThis feels like it should be the easiest game of all time.\n\n55:42.600 --> 55:45.600\nBut I bet it's not going to be.\n\n55:45.600 --> 55:46.600\nWe'll see.\n\n55:46.600 --> 55:47.600\nAll right.\n\n55:47.600 --> 55:50.600\nSo let's go ahead and begin.\n\n55:50.600 --> 55:54.600\nThe game will be done when it feels right for it to be over.\n\n55:54.600 --> 55:56.600\nWe're out here then.\n\n55:56.600 --> 56:00.600\nAdam and Spencer try to contain yourselves.\n\n56:00.600 --> 56:01.600\nYeah.\n\n56:01.600 --> 56:04.600\nWhy are we necessary for this?\n\n56:04.600 --> 56:06.600\nLike to be...\n\n56:06.600 --> 56:08.600\nWell, as a visual.\n\n56:08.600 --> 56:10.600\nSo people can see Adam or Spencer.\n\n56:10.600 --> 56:11.600\nVisual for the podcast.\n\n56:11.600 --> 56:13.600\nFor the Vanna White.\n\n56:13.600 --> 56:16.600\nFor the live audience.\n\n56:16.600 --> 56:20.600\nLet's read Spencer quotes and then have it be Spencer or Spencer.\n\n56:20.600 --> 56:21.600\nWhat?\n\n56:21.600 --> 56:22.600\nAll right.\n\n56:22.600 --> 56:23.600\nI'll be back.\n\n56:23.600 --> 56:24.600\nI'll be back on half hour.\n\n56:24.600 --> 56:26.600\nI need the visual.\n\n56:26.600 --> 56:28.600\nThank you for...\n\n56:28.600 --> 56:29.600\nOkay.\n\n56:29.600 --> 56:31.600\nLet's go ahead and begin.\n\n56:31.600 --> 56:32.600\nAnd it's not timed.\n\n56:32.600 --> 56:35.600\nYou guys can talk it out and then give me your final answer.\n\n56:35.600 --> 56:37.600\nWe're fighting against each other.\n\n56:37.600 --> 56:38.600\nOkay.\n\n56:38.600 --> 56:39.600\nFirst question.\n\n56:39.600 --> 56:42.600\nWhen asked, what is your biggest fear?\n\n56:42.600 --> 56:48.600\nWho said, be entrapped underground for reals?\n\n56:48.600 --> 56:49.600\nBiggest fear.\n\n56:49.600 --> 56:53.600\nWho said, be entrapped underground for reals?\n\n56:53.600 --> 56:55.600\nI think, I know.\n\n56:55.600 --> 56:57.600\nMy guess would be Spencer.\n\n56:57.600 --> 56:59.600\nBecause it sounds like something Spencer would say also.\n\n56:59.600 --> 57:11.600\nBecause I truly believe Adam is without fear.\n\n57:11.600 --> 57:15.600\nThat's not a compliment.\n\n57:15.600 --> 57:20.600\nSociopaths have no fear.\n\n57:20.600 --> 57:23.600\nLighten in strikes again.\n\n57:23.600 --> 57:25.600\nI mean, I agree, absolutely.\n\n57:25.600 --> 57:31.600\nI know that Spencer uses that colloquial apostrophe instead of a G kind of talking.\n\n57:31.600 --> 57:33.600\nThe idea that he typed it is very charming.\n\n57:33.600 --> 57:36.600\nAll right.\n\n57:36.600 --> 57:39.600\nBe entrapped underground for reals.\n\n57:39.600 --> 57:41.600\nHe does have falcony qualities.\n\n57:41.600 --> 57:42.600\nYou're right.\n\n57:42.600 --> 57:45.600\nThere's something very graceful about you.\n\n57:45.600 --> 57:46.600\nThank you.\n\n57:46.600 --> 57:47.600\nYeah.\n\n57:47.600 --> 57:49.600\nThat is a compliment.\n\n57:49.600 --> 57:52.600\nThe correct answer was actually Adam.\n\n57:52.600 --> 57:59.600\nNo, you read a how-to guide on how to present as human.\n\n57:59.600 --> 58:03.600\nHumans die, right?\n\n58:03.600 --> 58:08.600\nI live in my castle forever, but that one won't get them.\n\n58:08.600 --> 58:09.600\nAll right.\n\n58:09.600 --> 58:15.600\nHe's a worthier adversary than we had anticipated.\n\n58:15.600 --> 58:16.600\nOkay.\n\n58:16.600 --> 58:17.600\nNext question.\n\n58:17.600 --> 58:20.600\nI can feel my V's and W's sometimes.\n\n58:20.600 --> 58:21.600\nNext question.\n\n58:21.600 --> 58:26.600\nWhen asked to describe an embarrassing moment from his childhood, who said,\n\n58:26.600 --> 58:32.600\nI called a lady fat, she was fat.\n\n58:32.600 --> 58:35.600\nWhen asked to describe an embarrassing moment from his childhood,\n\n58:35.600 --> 58:38.600\nwho said I called a lady fat, she was fat.\n\n58:38.600 --> 58:41.600\nAgain, my guess would be Spencer.\n\n58:41.600 --> 58:42.600\nMe too, yeah.\n\n58:42.600 --> 58:45.600\nBecause Adam clearly does not get embarrassed.\n\n58:45.600 --> 58:47.600\nNo, she was fat.\n\n58:47.600 --> 58:48.600\nNo, no.\n\n58:48.600 --> 58:49.600\nNo, no.\n\n58:49.600 --> 58:50.600\nWhat's going on?\n\n58:50.600 --> 58:51.600\nWhat's your guess?\n\n58:51.600 --> 58:52.600\nNo, no.\n\n58:52.600 --> 58:53.600\nHe's fucking.\n\n58:53.600 --> 58:54.600\nAm I messing with you?\n\n58:54.600 --> 58:55.600\nThat is correct.\n\n58:55.600 --> 58:56.600\nIt was Spencer.\n\n58:56.600 --> 59:01.600\nI'm batting 100 so far.\n\n59:01.600 --> 59:03.600\nNext question.\n\n59:03.600 --> 59:10.600\nWhen asked, you can eat three things for the rest of your life.\n\n59:10.600 --> 59:11.600\nWhat are they?\n\n59:11.600 --> 59:15.600\nWho said potatoes, rice.\n\n59:15.600 --> 59:19.600\nAnd the souls of the unsullied.\n\n59:19.600 --> 59:27.600\nAdam Goldberg.\n\n59:27.600 --> 59:28.600\nOkay, I'm going to give you.\n\n59:28.600 --> 59:29.600\nI'm sorry.\n\n59:29.600 --> 59:30.600\nI'm sorry.\n\n59:30.600 --> 59:31.600\nCould you read those?\n\n59:31.600 --> 59:32.600\nHalf bread.\n\n59:32.600 --> 59:33.600\nHalf bread.\n\n59:33.600 --> 59:36.600\nThe three things were potatoes, rice, pizza.\n\n59:36.600 --> 59:42.600\nWho, for the rest of his life, will only eat potatoes, rice, pizza.\n\n59:42.600 --> 59:49.600\nWell, I mean, I'm going to go Spencer again because I know Adam's response to that question\n\n59:49.600 --> 59:51.600\nwould be more complicated.\n\n59:51.600 --> 59:58.600\nI think Adam would say, well, I have a rare form of anemia that requires that I have insulin.\n\n59:58.600 --> 01:00:01.600\nHe would, I don't know, something that would be circuitous.\n\n01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:04.600\nOf all the things you accuse me of, diabetes.\n\n01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:06.600\nI didn't mean to.\n\n01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:08.600\nIt's on the long list, but I did not see diabetes.\n\n01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:13.600\nI just assumed your diet is complicated or that even if it wasn't, like that you would,\n\n01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:19.600\nyeah, I could see Spencer as being a simple, simple child who just wants to bolt up.\n\n01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:20.600\nYou know what?\n\n01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:21.600\nI feel like.\n\n01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:24.600\nFirst of all, who doesn't?\n\n01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:31.600\nBut I feel like part of Spencer's appeal is that he can sort of, I really feel like there's\n\n01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:38.600\nsomething about you that is above us, but that's a compliment, but also your ability\n\n01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:42.600\nto sort of connect with regular normal humans.\n\n01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:45.600\nAnd this is all a compliment, by the way.\n\n01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:48.600\nYou once said that you could have a religion, Spencer.\n\n01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:53.600\nSo I would go with Spencer, too.\n\n01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:54.600\nThat is correct.\n\n01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:55.600\nIt was Spencer.\n\n01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:57.600\nWhat would your answer have been, Adam?\n\n01:00:57.600 --> 01:01:03.600\nI was considering a real answer about how you can make a lot of cuisine with the same\n\n01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:04.600\nthree foods.\n\n01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:05.600\nExactly.\n\n01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:07.600\nCan you tell us the other answers?\n\n01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:08.600\nYou can read my joke answer.\n\n01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:11.600\nAdam said dwindling rapidly.\n\n01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:13.600\nWhich fits the context of the question.\n\n01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:16.600\nRewind the podcast and put my answer in the question together.\n\n01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:17.600\nIt's pretty funny.\n\n01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:21.600\nI nailed it.\n\n01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:23.600\nCheck that out.\n\n01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:24.600\nRewind.\n\n01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:31.600\nSorry that laughed privately.\n\n01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:34.600\nAdam has all this overlap with Spencer.\n\n01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:36.600\nI would say they're both above.\n\n01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:37.600\nCertainly.\n\n01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:45.600\nI don't know what the difference is, but Adam's jokes, they rhythmically, they land on the\n\n01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:46.600\ndownbeat.\n\n01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:52.600\nAnd then everyone's like, you can't dance to it.\n\n01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:58.600\nIt's like trying to watch Edward Scissorhands shake hands.\n\n01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:00.600\nHe doesn't have the tools.\n\n01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:05.600\nBut when you listen to anything that he says, if you listen to that interview that he did\n\n01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:11.600\nwith the podcast cast and stuff like that, Adam's like, he's no...\n\n01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:17.600\nI'm out of sync with this plane of existence.\n\n01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:22.600\nOkay, next question.\n\n01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:24.600\nCan I ask, why were you counting?\n\n01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:25.600\nWhat was going on?\n\n01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:27.600\nI was trying to get to the rhythm.\n\n01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:35.600\nI did think it would involve him slowing himself down in some unnatural way.\n\n01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:36.600\nWhich is unfair.\n\n01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:38.600\nIt was very appealing for some reason.\n\n01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:39.600\nI don't know why.\n\n01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:40.600\nI liked it.\n\n01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:41.600\nAll right.\n\n01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:42.600\nNext question.\n\n01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:52.600\nHow about we got to go into Adam's brain and slide out those 2001...\n\n01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:57.600\nI'm sorry, I can't do that, Dan.\n\n01:02:57.600 --> 01:03:00.600\nThanks for doing this, Adam.\n\n01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:02.600\nAll right.\n\n01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:08.600\nNext, I asked both gentlemen, you were just given a yacht.\n\n01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:11.600\nWhat do you name it?\n\n01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:13.600\nThis was good, Aaron.\n\n01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:15.600\nYou did good.\n\n01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:17.600\nOh, you know how much I need that.\n\n01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:23.600\nWell, you know how much I never give people what they need.\n\n01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:25.600\nThe more they need it, the more I don't want to give it to them.\n\n01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:29.600\nSo I really, you know, I really feel you did a good job of this game.\n\n01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:35.600\nThis game has no winners.\n\n01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:40.600\nIt's becoming clear that this game just has a loser and it's not anyone who's playing.\n\n01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:42.600\nI thought by the start of that sentence.\n\n01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:44.600\nNo, you're not playing.\n\n01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:46.600\nShe is talking about

heart.\n\n01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:56.600\nThat accent was on the downbeat.\n\n01:03:56.600 --> 01:03:58.600\nNo, Adam's answers are great.\n\n01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:00.600\nI'm not...\n\n01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:02.600\nGreat, Adam's a very smart man.\n\n01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:06.600\nWho said when asked what he would name his yacht?\n\n01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:08.600\nI love this.\n\n01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:10.600\nCarl Rove.\n\n01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:16.600\nWhen asked what he would name his yacht,\n\n01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:20.600\nwho said Carl Rove?\n\n01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:28.600\nI think that Spencer knows who Carl Rove is, but I don't think he cares.\n\n01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:36.600\nI think Adam maybe would be the one to try to make some point with naming his yacht.\n\n01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:38.600\nDitto.\n\n01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:44.600\nI feel like we're thinking exactly the same on all of these.\n\n01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:46.600\nCan you tell us what the other answer was?\n\n01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:48.600\nI can't do that.\n\n01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:54.600\nThe other answer was the USS Hubris.\n\n01:04:54.600 --> 01:05:00.600\nThe USS Hubris.\n\n01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:04.600\nI mean, that's what I'd named mine, by the way.\n\n01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:12.600\nSo whoever said that should really be proud of themselves.\n\n01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:16.600\nI'm guessing you're Hubris and he's Rove.\n\n01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:18.600\nCorrect.\n\n01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:20.600\nAdam.\n\n01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:24.600\nSo what were the final...\n\n01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:26.600\nWe both thought that Carl Rove would be Adam.\n\n01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:28.600\nThat was Carl Rove was Spencer.\n\n01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:30.600\nWow.\n\n01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:32.600\nIt's like the same title.\n\n01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:34.600\nAs USS Hubris.\n\n01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:36.600\nOh, it's just like a rich guy's name.\n\n01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:38.600\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:42.600\nIt's like a symbol of power and excess over others.\n\n01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:44.600\nWhich is what a yacht is.\n\n01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:46.600\nYeah, that's what I mean.\n\n01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:48.600\nIt's like, hey, you should come out to Carl Rove.\n\n01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:50.600\nIt's funny.\n\n01:05:50.600 --> 01:05:54.600\nLet's go get drunk on

01:12:23.600\nIt goes both ways.\n\n01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:25.600\nI'm taking advantage of them.\n\n01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:27.600\nBut the same thing that's making him adorable\n\n01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:29.600\nmakes it hard to talk to...\n\n01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:31.600\nPeople are adoring the fact that\n\n01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:33.600\nfinally on display is a personality\n\n01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:35.600\nthat's very resonant,\n\n01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:37.600\nwhich is someone who doesn't normally...\n\n01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:39.600\nYou know, doesn't do that fucking tango\n\n01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:41.600\nin a one-on-one interaction.\n\n01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:43.600\nMy theory is that Spencer is secretly dating\n\n01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:45.600\nsomeone famous like Paul Abdul.\n\n01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:48.600\nI'd like to live\n\n01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:51.600\nin how coomail perceives me.\n\n01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:53.600\nYou call it men?\n\n01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:55.600\nI'd shoot lasers and\n\n01:12:55.600 --> 01:12:57.600\nship kittens.\n\n01:12:57.600 --> 01:12:59.600\nAnd they'd still be enjoyable.\n\n01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:01.600\nI'd say I'd get it,\n\n01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:03.600\nbecause I watch the documentary footage,\n\n01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:05.600\nso I've seen footage\n\n01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:07.600\nof you interacting with women\n\n01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:09.600\nafter shows on tour.\n\n01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:11.600\nDid you see them introducing me to their boyfriends?\n\n01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:13.600\nUh...\n\n01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:15.600\nNo, no.\n\n01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:17.600\nThat's good editing.\n\n01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:19.600\nI've seen a handful of cute girls\n\n01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:21.600\nget you to sign stuff\n\n01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:23.600\nand be just as nervous as you are,\n\n01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:25.600\nand like kind of lingering\n\n01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:27.600\nand hanging out.\n\n01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:29.600\nThe fratty part of\n\n01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:31.600\nmy brain, you know, wants to go like\n\n01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:33.600\noh, hit on her!\n\n01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:35.600\nBut it's like...\n\n01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:37.600\nThen you wouldn't be Spencer.\n\n01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:39.600\nAnd she also is like, you're not...\n\n01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:41.600\nYeah, I don't know.\n\n01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:43.600\nI have a weird love-hate relationship\n\n01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:45.600\nwith this idea.\n\n01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:47.600\nYou know...\n\n01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:49.600\nThat's the puss.\n\n01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:51.600\nI, for one, am totally\n\n01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:53.600\nover it.\n\n01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:55.600\nYou're over what?\n\n01:13:55.600 --> 01:13:57.600\nI'm over the matchmaking for Spencer,\n\n01:13:57.600 --> 01:13:59.600\nbecause he's punished me even when I'm not asking for it.\n\n01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:01.600\nIt's a big inner friendship.\n\n01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:03.600\nWhy don't you try and...\n\n01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:05.600\nhelp Adam?\n\n01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:07.600\nI could fit a bird day into my schedule.\n\n01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:13.600\nThat was great.\n\n01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:15.600\nI also don't think it's like\n\n01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:17.600\nI don't think Spencer necessarily\n\n01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:19.600\nneeds a girlfriend.\n\n01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:21.600\nI think if someone's autonomous and happy,\n\n01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:23.600\nthey don't need to be with anybody.\n\n01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:25.600\nEverybody likes to have sex.\n\n01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:27.600\nWell, I think that Spencer has sex.\n\n01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:29.600\nYou're right.\n\n01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:31.600\nI think the Spencer-ness of him\n\n01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:33.600\nwould not be there.\n\n01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:35.600\nHe's right next to you.\n\n01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:37.600\nI'm barely autonomous or happy.\n\n01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:41.600\nOnly a few more questions,\n\n01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:43.600\nif not one or two.\n\n01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:45.600\nWe're having a good time up here.\n\n01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:47.600\nThat's the four of us.\n\n01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:49.600\nI'm having a good time.\n\n01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:51.600\nIf there were a holiday in your honor,\n\n01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:53.600\nwhat would it celebrate?\n\n01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:55.600\nWho said\n\n01:14:55.600 --> 01:14:57.600\ncourage?\n\n01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:07.600\nIf there were a holiday in your honor,\n\n01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:09.600\nwhat would it celebrate?\n\n01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:13.600\nWho said courage?\n\n01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:17.600\nAlso the name of my firstborn.\n\n01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:21.600\nI'll just go Adam,\n\n01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:23.600\nbecause...\n\n01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:25.600\nI think he...\n\n01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:27.600\nYou see yourself as very brave, I think.\n\n01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:29.600\nNot that you're not.\n\n01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:31.600\nYou said he doesn't have fear.\n\n01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:33.600\nYou were without fear, yeah.\n\n01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:35.600\nLook when he tolerates up here.\n\n01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:37.600\nYeah, I know, it's great.\n\n01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:39.600\nIn fact, said my birth.\n\n01:15:39.600 --> 01:15:41.600\nIt was Spencer who said courage.\n\n01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:45.600\nCan I explain my answer?\n\n01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:47.600\nAt some point I was like,\n\n01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:49.600\nI should answer things that people might think\n\n01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:51.600\nAdam would say.\n\n01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:55.600\nWish I said courage.\n\n01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:01.600\nWhen I wrote my birth, I was trying to write\n\n01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:03.600\nan answer Spencer might say.\n\n01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:05.600\nI was going to write myself.\n\n01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:07.600\nAnd then I changed it to courage.\n\n01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:09.600\nThis is amazing.\n\n01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:11.600\nYou guys are trying to be each other,\n\n01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:13.600\nand very accurate at it.\n\n01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:15.600\nYou should have read the whole questionnaire.\n\n01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:17.600\nWhen asked what punctuation mark\n\n01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:19.600\nbest describes your personality,\n\n01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:21.600\nwho said an ellipsis,\n\n01:16:21.600 --> 01:16:23.600\nand who said an enterobang?\n\n01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:25.600\nWhen asked\n\n01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:27.600\nwhat punctuation mark\n\n01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:29.600\nbest describes your personality?\n\n01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:31.600\nEnterobang.\n\n01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:33.600\nI heard all that, I just don't want an enterobang.\n\n01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:35.600\nIt's an exclamation mark.\n\n01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:37.600\nHow is this happening?\n\n01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:43.600\nIt's alternating question marks\n\n01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:45.600\nand exclamation marks.\n\n01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:47.600\nCan it be one pairing of them?\n\n01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:49.600\nIs that still an enterobang?\n\n01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:51.600\nYeah, you see it a lot on\n\n01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:53.600\nline writing.\n\n01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:55.600\nIt's not like a proper...\n\n01:16:55.600 --> 01:16:57.600\nBut it's not like Beatle Bailey swearing.\n\n01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:01.600\nThat is called growlix.\n\n01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:03.600\nThose weird like symbols,\n\n01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:05.600\nthose are called growlix.\n\n01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:07.600\nDo you listen to Wait, Wait, Don't Tell Me?\n\n01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:09.600\nThat's like an answer on that.\n\n01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:11.600\nGrowlixes?\n\n01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:13.600\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:15.600\nYou can check out Wait, Wait, Don't Tell Me on...\n\n01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:17.600\nTuesday nights at 9.\n\n01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:19.600\nWho said ellipsis,\n\n01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:21.600\nand who said enterobang?\n\n01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:23.600\nWell, now the jig is up.\n\n01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:25.600\nWe got one guy doing an impression of the other guy.\n\n01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:27.600\nI don't know.\n\n01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:29.600\nI don't know if that's true.\n\n01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:31.600\nJust...\n\n01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:33.600\nI'll say that\n\n01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:35.600\nSpencer did the enterobang.\n\n01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:37.600\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:39.600\nI mean, if he was going to answer honestly,\n\n01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:41.600\nI guess he'd be an ellipsis.\n\n01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:43.600\nSpencer.\n\n01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:45.600\nSpencer would be an ellipsis.\n\n01:17:45.600 --> 01:17:47.600\nIt's thoughtful and reserved.\n\n01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:49.600\nTiming is king for Spencer.\n\n01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:51.600\nIt's very, very restrained.\n\n01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:53.600\nYeah.\n\n01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:55.600\nAdam, as we know, is just...\n\n01:17:55.600 --> 01:17:57.600\nEveryone's reaction to him is an enterobang.\n\n01:17:57.600 --> 01:17:59.600\nHe's up on stage again.\n\n01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:01.600\nHuh?\n\n01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:03.600\nHe's like Marmaduke.\n\n01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:05.600\nCan I say something?\n\n01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:07.600\nA large success movie?\n\n01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:09.600\nThat was great.\n\n01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:11.600\nI made a Marmaduke movie.\n\n01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:13.600\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:15.600\nYou know what? I'm sorry, this is not going to plan the podcast\n\n01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:17.600\nor even the people here, but the fact that your toenails\n\n01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:19.600\nexactly match that guy's shoe color\n\n01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:21.600\nis I cannot...\n\n01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:23.600\nI'm like staring...\n\n01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:25.600\nat your toes.\n\n01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:27.600\nDo you guys know each other?
