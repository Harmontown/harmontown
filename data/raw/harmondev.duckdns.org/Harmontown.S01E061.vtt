00:00.000 --> 00:12.600
Live from the Nerdmelt Theater in beautiful Hollywood, California,

00:12.600 --> 00:14.600
Harmontown is now in session!

00:14.600 --> 00:25.600
And now, let's welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmontown, also my man, Dan Harmon!

00:25.600 --> 00:35.600
Thank you, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry about everything.

00:35.600 --> 00:40.600
Well you were here, I mean we were all, we all thought everything was fine.

00:40.600 --> 00:45.600
I am out of practice at being quite so clickable, clickably delicious.

00:45.600 --> 00:58.600
I'm fine with it, I don't know if anyone was bothering to feel sorry for me, but I'm getting really used to this.

00:58.600 --> 01:05.600
I have a publicist now whose job is to keep, make me less famous.

01:05.600 --> 01:14.600
He's a really cool guy, I don't imagine he'd ever come on the show and answer questions about what it means to be Dan Harmon's publicist.

01:14.600 --> 01:17.600
I think that would be a really interesting interview.

01:17.600 --> 01:21.600
Can you talk about your Hollywood Reporter photo shoot?

01:21.600 --> 01:29.600
No, I can't because it's technically a joke about, oh, that involves the concept that, I can't.

01:29.600 --> 01:32.600
Sorry, I've already screwed up, I gotta write a letter.

01:32.600 --> 01:39.600
Comptroller Erin McGathy, let us know what it is.

01:39.600 --> 01:47.600
Well let's just, I mean I think I can beat around that word and not be quotable.

01:47.600 --> 01:55.600
Obviously as my publicist, this guy is a little, he's got his hands full sometimes.

01:55.600 --> 02:07.600
And they came to do a photo shoot of me for this article that Dan's happy and he's humble and he's back and he's happy to be back at work.

02:07.600 --> 02:11.600
And he was like, yeah, just smile a lot.

02:11.600 --> 02:19.600
Don't let him get any pictures of you frowning or doing anything other than just smiling a lot.

02:19.600 --> 02:27.600
There's no sets at Paramount that are up, their construction hasn't begun,

02:27.600 --> 02:33.600
but there is one facade that's like, if you're a huge fan of community you might know what I'm talking about when I say Borchard Hall.

02:33.600 --> 02:39.600
It's a cross on the Paramount lot from where the library steps usually are,

02:39.600 --> 02:42.600
but the library steps aren't there and so this is the only thing.

02:42.600 --> 02:51.600
It's got the Greendale insignia on the door and it says Borchard Hall at the top and the photographer tells me,

02:51.600 --> 02:58.600
yeah, just go through the door and then you're coming in so you just kind of open the door a little bit and stick your head through.

02:58.600 --> 03:05.600
Long story short, very creepy photo.

03:05.600 --> 03:14.600
Daddy's home and he's been drinking and publicist's face just purple.

03:14.600 --> 03:17.600
Yeah, but I brought him on for a while in season.

03:17.600 --> 03:22.600
I don't know, was it two or three or something like that because I actually felt like,

03:22.600 --> 03:28.600
well, if people want to do interviews with me and stuff that can help get ratings for the show,

03:28.600 --> 03:32.600
like it's a form of promotion if I bring him on out of pocket and stuff.

03:32.600 --> 03:36.600
So originally his job was to help me be famous.

03:36.600 --> 03:38.600
I think that's generally what a publicist's job was.

03:38.600 --> 03:40.600
They probably say it's more nuanced than that,

03:40.600 --> 03:44.600
but also just get me Comic-Con badges or something.

03:44.600 --> 03:49.600
He's just a handy guy to have around and then I let him go after a while because I was like,

03:49.600 --> 03:52.600
okay, no one's ever going to watch the show no matter what.

03:52.600 --> 03:54.600
And also I got fired and blah, blah, blah.

03:54.600 --> 03:56.600
I was like, take some time off.

03:56.600 --> 03:58.600
Cool your jets.

03:58.600 --> 04:03.600
And I brought him back on to actually just help me.

04:03.600 --> 04:06.600
God, save me from myself.

04:06.600 --> 04:08.600
Anyways.

04:08.600 --> 04:11.600
Yeah, so it is a funny thing.

04:11.600 --> 04:13.600
This new phenomenon, it's called context.

04:13.600 --> 04:15.600
It's a weird, weird thing.

04:15.600 --> 04:23.600
I've said many times, this is my therapy.

04:23.600 --> 04:26.600
I have enough voices bouncing around in my head to deal with.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.600
I don't want my own in there too.

04:28.600 --> 04:35.600
And when I say the stuff that's in my head into a microphone and people laugh or even just sit there and don't stab me,

04:35.600 --> 04:39.600
it's done, it's finished, it's dealt with.

04:39.600 --> 04:45.600
Go on.

04:45.600 --> 04:52.600
And so every once in a while, from this crucible, this 60 episode run of this online diary that I'm keeping called Armatown,

04:52.600 --> 05:02.600
this little magma drop of harmonious like flies out and lands in the shire and just bursts everything into play.

05:02.600 --> 05:10.600
And you realize, oh, God, guess what, everybody that was hurt or anything like that,

05:10.600 --> 05:16.600
I guarantee you that when I want to speak to you in the form of a headline in Variety,

05:16.600 --> 05:23.600
I'll say much, much nicer things than I do to my bathroom mirror or here or stuff like that.

05:23.600 --> 05:25.600
I'm not excusing anything.

05:25.600 --> 05:27.600
I just wanted to make that clear.

05:27.600 --> 05:29.600
Why do these things happen?

05:29.600 --> 05:32.600
Language is important to me too.

05:32.600 --> 05:33.600
I'm a writer, definitely.

05:33.600 --> 05:35.600
But I improvise when I'm up here.

05:35.600 --> 05:37.600
And I've said some really horrible things.

05:37.600 --> 05:41.600
Anybody who wants to really, really hate me, just go through.

05:41.600 --> 05:44.600
I don't know what will happen to you.

05:44.600 --> 05:46.600
I've never listened to all of it either, but it's there.

05:46.600 --> 05:48.600
I am here for you.

05:48.600 --> 05:50.600
I am on Twitter.

05:50.600 --> 05:53.600
I blog my apologies when I do things wrong.

05:53.600 --> 05:56.600
I do the Reddit AMAs.

05:56.600 --> 05:59.600
I like being in touch with people.

05:59.600 --> 06:05.600
I think the big takeaway from this latest debacle for me emotionally was,

06:05.600 --> 06:09.600
I got to somehow figure out at the age of 40 how to stop caring so much.

06:09.600 --> 06:11.600
What about people's opinion of me?

06:11.600 --> 06:16.600
Because I think that the reason I do what I do,

06:16.600 --> 06:19.600
I know that the reason I do what I do is to make people like me.

06:19.600 --> 06:23.600
And I'm very comfortable with the idea that what you're supposed to like is the thing that I make.

06:23.600 --> 06:31.600
There's nothing inappropriate or wrong way rubbing about an episode of my NBC sitcom.

06:31.600 --> 06:34.600
And there's nothing dishonest about it either.

06:34.600 --> 06:40.600
It is an actual genuine Valentine to humanity that I have time to prepare and polish

06:40.600 --> 06:44.600
and put on my little bow tie and show up to your door with flowers and candy.

06:44.600 --> 06:48.600
That's me at my best for you in that context so that you will go,

06:48.600 --> 06:53.600
oh, I feel happy right now. Who made me happy? Oh, it says created by so-and-so.

06:53.600 --> 06:55.600
Oh, he must be a good person.

06:55.600 --> 07:02.600
And I guess I've got to cop to the fact that I never will be.

07:02.600 --> 07:07.600
I guess because under, you know, or nobody's a good person.

07:07.600 --> 07:18.600
Steve Levitan doesn't have a show where he just babbles into a microphone with a cup of vodka.

07:18.600 --> 07:25.600
And that is why he is a better person than me and will die richer and have higher ratings

07:25.600 --> 07:28.600
and be more successful. God, he's so handsome too.

07:28.600 --> 07:33.600
Have you ever seen a photo of Google Steve Levitan? It's obnoxious.

07:33.600 --> 07:38.600
He's so good-looking.

07:38.600 --> 07:43.600
So anyways, I happened just by pure circumstance and I thought, you know,

07:43.600 --> 07:46.600
just as Spencer showing up and saying, I want to be a Dungeon Master,

07:46.600 --> 07:54.600
like, Harmontown kind of runs on coincidences and mysticism and shamanic events.

07:54.600 --> 08:00.600
I was at a bar. That is not an unusual event.

08:00.600 --> 08:07.600
That's just statistics. I was at a bar and ran into friends of our producer, Dusty Samples,

08:07.600 --> 08:15.600
Dustin Marshall, and these two adorable little kids.

08:15.600 --> 08:18.600
They're from this band called Mars Argo.

08:18.600 --> 08:23.600
And they just recently, I mean, they're, you know, they're great.

08:23.600 --> 08:31.600
I assume I have a horrible taste of music, but they just recently did this thing

08:31.600 --> 08:35.600
where they did a song, I think it was called Don't Call Me.

08:35.600 --> 08:37.600
Is that the name of the song?

08:37.600 --> 08:44.600
It's based on a sample of the iPhone ringtone Marimba that we all know.

08:44.600 --> 08:48.600
Like, when you hear the song for the first eight seconds, you're checking your pockets

08:48.600 --> 08:53.600
and it's like a baby crying on an airplane for that eight seconds.

08:53.600 --> 08:58.600
And it's a song about a guy that won't stop calling and it fits.

08:58.600 --> 09:01.600
And after a while, you stop hearing that and just hear like a really nice song.

09:01.600 --> 09:05.600
It doesn't matter if it's a good song or a bad song.

09:05.600 --> 09:10.600
The interesting thing is that because it uses that iPhone sample,

09:10.600 --> 09:15.600
all of a sudden, much as sometimes a Harmontown droplet lands in the headlines of Variety

09:15.600 --> 09:20.600
and all of a sudden I'm being compared to Charlie Sheen by Society,

09:20.600 --> 09:23.600
I'm a writer.

09:23.600 --> 09:26.600
Okay.

09:26.600 --> 09:34.600
These guys, because of this iPhone hook, you know, it's now it's a, you know,

09:34.600 --> 09:36.600
all of a sudden it's just a thing.

09:36.600 --> 09:39.600
It's got to, I guess, I'll be an old fogey and say it went viral.

09:39.600 --> 09:47.600
It was like in the technology section of this thing and the Apple lovers section of this thing

09:47.600 --> 09:50.600
and the what's going on section of this and that.

09:50.600 --> 09:54.600
Kind of like it was a virality happened and as a result,

09:54.600 --> 10:00.600
they suddenly found themselves as very emotional, wonderful, passionate musicians

10:00.600 --> 10:03.600
and something that's become increasingly familiar to me,

10:03.600 --> 10:07.600
which is being under this microscope of this giant blob

10:07.600 --> 10:10.600
called people who don't normally give a fuck about you.

10:10.600 --> 10:14.600
And let's continue the conversation with them on stage.

10:14.600 --> 10:18.600
Please welcome Titanic Sinclair and Mars Argo of Mars Argo.

10:18.600 --> 10:32.600
I'm kind of short.

10:32.600 --> 10:34.600
That's good. That's good these days.

10:34.600 --> 10:36.600
I wore shorts too.

10:36.600 --> 10:38.600
Short is the new tall.

10:38.600 --> 10:40.600
Cute matching hats, guys.

10:40.600 --> 10:41.600
It was unplanned.

10:41.600 --> 10:44.600
We're all dinkies.

10:44.600 --> 10:48.600
So describe the reason I called you guys.

10:48.600 --> 10:53.600
I asked you guys if you would come here is because I ran into Titanic.

10:53.600 --> 10:55.600
It's a stage name.

10:55.600 --> 10:58.600
Because of the death threats.

10:58.600 --> 11:05.600
And Mars was not there and you were looking kind of,

11:05.600 --> 11:08.600
you were chill, I won't say sullen.

11:08.600 --> 11:16.600
You were, your emo had an extra genuine emo to it.

11:16.600 --> 11:18.600
Something there.

11:18.600 --> 11:25.600
And immediately in a short conversation it turned out that Mars was at home

11:25.600 --> 11:32.600
unable to really go out because of the response and the comment sections

11:32.600 --> 11:36.600
under these videos that are being posted, right?

11:36.600 --> 11:38.600
I'm also actually sick.

11:38.600 --> 11:43.600
But yeah, I think maybe the whole thing kind of threw me over a little bit.

11:43.600 --> 11:45.600
It probably lowered your immune system.

11:45.600 --> 11:46.600
Possibly, yeah.

11:46.600 --> 11:47.600
My cat's living with a dog now.

11:47.600 --> 11:49.600
I think she's going to, she has FIB.

11:49.600 --> 11:53.600
I'm worried that she's going to die at any moment because I think that T-cells,

11:53.600 --> 11:55.600
I think they're linked to your emotional health.

11:55.600 --> 11:58.600
The dancing that he thinks you're going to die at any moment.

11:58.600 --> 12:00.600
Maybe.

12:00.600 --> 12:02.600
I don't know where to start.

12:02.600 --> 12:05.600
By the way, I'm a horrible interviewer to deal with it.

12:05.600 --> 12:12.600
Do you have in your head an example of a comment that really got you,

12:12.600 --> 12:16.600
that made you unable to leave your home?

12:16.600 --> 12:19.600
What an ugly singer.

12:19.600 --> 12:21.600
What an ugly voice.

12:21.600 --> 12:24.600
Which is almost worse than what an ugly singer.

12:24.600 --> 12:30.600
I guarantee you we've been threatened with dying of fire more than anyone else.

12:30.600 --> 12:31.600
Yeah.

12:31.600 --> 12:33.600
Or if you burn in a fire, I hope you.

12:33.600 --> 12:36.600
We have a YouTube channel.

12:36.600 --> 12:38.600
It's called Grocery Bag That TV if anyone's interested.

12:38.600 --> 12:43.600
And it's like, we poke fun at social commentary and stuff.

12:43.600 --> 12:48.600
And so people consistently tell us to die in a fire.

12:48.600 --> 12:49.600
So I'm used to that.

12:49.600 --> 12:51.600
But this kind of spiraled out of control.

12:51.600 --> 12:56.600
I knew we were getting ourselves into trouble by using the iPhone song to begin with.

12:56.600 --> 12:59.600
But I had no idea it was going to be so intense.

12:59.600 --> 13:01.600
You thought it would be critical trouble.

13:01.600 --> 13:05.600
You were used to a certain context, like I am here.

13:05.600 --> 13:10.600
You knew that something you did, as most artists are required to do,

13:10.600 --> 13:13.600
was going to be hit or miss and have some polarizing effect.

13:13.600 --> 13:22.600
But you were, I think, not to put words in your mouth, but the effect of all of a sudden this whole new audience

13:22.600 --> 13:28.600
called just people who don't, they're just reacting to something random.

13:28.600 --> 13:33.600
They just see a headline that has nothing to do with, that was the big trouble that I got into.

13:33.600 --> 13:38.600
Because I came out here and I reacted to the boohoo for me,

13:38.600 --> 13:43.600
such a sensation of watching a season of the show that I hadn't watched the entire time.

13:43.600 --> 13:44.600
It was without me.

13:44.600 --> 13:46.600
And I just kind of came out here and was like,

13:46.600 --> 13:50.600
just without thinking about any kind of context or who was listening,

13:50.600 --> 13:55.600
except for these 150 people and anyone that listens to a podcast about me,

13:55.600 --> 13:59.600
and therefore why would someone that hated me and didn't care what I had to say?

13:59.600 --> 14:00.600
Blah, blah, blah.

14:00.600 --> 14:03.600
I just kind of didn't think and just spoke.

14:03.600 --> 14:09.600
But then immediately, and it's like, why wouldn't I, this headline just goes like,

14:09.600 --> 14:13.600
Dan Harmon says this has a headline.

14:13.600 --> 14:15.600
It's like, no, that was not a headline.

14:15.600 --> 14:17.600
That wasn't a press conference.

14:17.600 --> 14:24.600
And now the horrible thing is you have people who, even if they are horrible people,

14:24.600 --> 14:28.600
they're not even really to blame for the fact that,

14:28.600 --> 14:32.600
if you're surfing through the internet and a thing says under sports and weather,

14:32.600 --> 14:38.600
it says, band makes song out of a ringtone.

14:38.600 --> 14:43.600
And then they click on it and then they watch the thing.

14:43.600 --> 14:47.600
And it's like, I don't know what makes them go as far.

14:47.600 --> 14:48.600
I've never done that before.

14:48.600 --> 14:52.600
I have never left a comment that I thought would make someone want to kill themselves.

14:52.600 --> 14:58.600
I have to assume, as a student of human character,

14:58.600 --> 15:02.600
I have to assume that the reason people do that is because they don't believe it's possible.

15:02.600 --> 15:05.600
It's like shooting a slingshot at the moon.

15:05.600 --> 15:08.600
They're just going like, hey, why don't you kill yourself?

15:08.600 --> 15:10.600
You stupid, ugly person with a horrible voice.

15:10.600 --> 15:11.600
This is a terrible song.

15:11.600 --> 15:13.600
Your band sucks, blah, blah, blah.

15:13.600 --> 15:20.600
They're just thinking like, well, don't never listen to old Toby Simmons.

15:20.600 --> 15:24.600
But the irony is that you guys are Toby Simmons.

15:24.600 --> 15:29.600
It's just a band from Detroit that is out in Hollywood.

15:29.600 --> 15:32.600
And everyone is Toby Simmons.

15:32.600 --> 15:36.600
We are now all in contact with each other.

15:36.600 --> 15:40.600
What band was that that got in that airplane accident?

15:40.600 --> 15:45.600
One of them was rolling out of the plane on fire with a Blink-182 gun.

15:45.600 --> 15:51.600
So of course, because it's Blink-182, it's okay for them to burn to death.

15:51.600 --> 15:55.600
People are just leaving comments.

15:55.600 --> 16:01.600
I forgot people are now going to publish transcripts of my podcast.

16:01.600 --> 16:06.600
Do you please put some brackets in there that I was being ironic?

16:06.600 --> 16:10.600
And put brackets behind everything that says I'm a human fucking being.

16:10.600 --> 16:13.600
Don't publish transcripts of podcasts.

16:13.600 --> 16:16.600
It's all free. It's all online.

16:16.600 --> 16:23.600
Anyways, he said winkingly,

16:23.600 --> 16:26.600
it's okay for Blink-182 to be on fire, right?

16:26.600 --> 16:29.600
Because they don't deserve anything that they have and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

16:29.600 --> 16:33.600
And the people are saying, you're saying they're threatening you.

16:33.600 --> 16:36.600
They're saying, die by fire. You're actually used to that.

16:36.600 --> 16:39.600
Bands die in fires a lot. It happens.

16:39.600 --> 16:43.600
That's an issue.

16:43.600 --> 16:47.600
More bands than lion tamers.

16:47.600 --> 16:51.600
Lion tamers get sometimes bit by lions.

16:51.600 --> 16:55.600
That would be rude to leave under Siegfried and Roy's YouTube channel.

16:55.600 --> 16:59.600
Like, I hope you get bit by a lion.

16:59.600 --> 17:02.600
Mean.

17:02.600 --> 17:11.600
So, talk about being at home that night.

17:11.600 --> 17:14.600
I was at the drying room.

17:14.600 --> 17:17.600
What did you physically do?

17:17.600 --> 17:20.600
Actually, I don't know.

17:20.600 --> 17:23.600
Do you sit there and troll through all the comments?

17:23.600 --> 17:27.600
It's weird because it started on Reddit.

17:27.600 --> 17:30.600
A lot of our stuff gets posted on Reddit.

17:30.600 --> 17:32.600
I use Reddit like crazy.

17:32.600 --> 17:37.600
It's usually pretty friendly, but I could tell right off the bat from the first couple of comments.

17:37.600 --> 17:40.600
It wasn't going to be good.

17:40.600 --> 17:42.600
I don't know.

17:42.600 --> 17:46.600
I read a couple and the general consensus was, this is annoying.

17:46.600 --> 17:48.600
Her voice is annoying.

17:48.600 --> 17:51.600
You get to a point where it's like every single comment and then the views start going up.

17:51.600 --> 17:54.600
Then you're just like, I'm just going to stop reading these now.

17:54.600 --> 17:57.600
Yeah, but no, I keep reading them.

17:57.600 --> 18:02.600
Did you get to the point, I don't know if you're able to answer this question.

18:02.600 --> 18:06.600
Have you gotten to the point where you wish the song didn't exist?

18:06.600 --> 18:08.600
Do you wish that you hadn't created something?

18:08.600 --> 18:15.600
When we tracked that, we had two engineers that bailed on us right when we were tracking it.

18:15.600 --> 18:17.600
What do you mean by that?

18:17.600 --> 18:23.600
When we were actually shooting the thing, we were doing this on a shoestring and two engineers that agreed to do it

18:23.600 --> 18:28.600
didn't show up on the day of the shoot and then we had issues with camera stuff and everything.

18:28.600 --> 18:34.600
I knew before I released it that it wasn't my favorite thing or it wasn't the best vocal take

18:34.600 --> 18:39.600
maybe it wasn't the best mix or whatever, but at the same time I'm like whatever.

18:39.600 --> 18:43.600
But your job as an artist is to put it out there.

18:43.600 --> 18:49.600
Take off the top of your head, hold a piece of paper to get as accurate a print of who you are

18:49.600 --> 18:52.600
during your limited time on this planet and get it out there.

18:52.600 --> 18:56.600
So I did, I was uncomfortable but I was just like alright, there you go.

18:56.600 --> 19:02.600
And then it was just like a bunch of old men talking shit to me basically.

19:02.600 --> 19:06.600
People always say there's no such thing as bad press but I don't think that,

19:06.600 --> 19:12.600
I don't think the people who say that have ever got an email but no subject and the body of the email is just kill yourself.

19:12.600 --> 19:14.600
I need that.

19:14.600 --> 19:16.600
I have several, several of these.

19:16.600 --> 19:18.600
That's so terrible.

19:18.600 --> 19:23.600
How did you guys process that as a couple?

19:23.600 --> 19:27.600
I feel it now, I drank it, I got really sick and I'm still sick.

19:27.600 --> 19:31.600
I'm sure I was sick anyway, but whatever.

19:31.600 --> 19:35.600
But you say yourself, because this is something that's been happening to me over the last two days,

19:35.600 --> 19:42.600
and again I'm used to it, I know that it takes a week for my horrible clumsy footprints to get snowed over

19:42.600 --> 19:51.600
and I can safely go maybe take a peek into Tumblr without seeing a photo of me looking like I just sexually assaulted a woman.

19:51.600 --> 20:02.600
The hand picked from God knows where, someone who's become ironically my biggest fan in order to find that picture.

20:02.600 --> 20:12.600
The weird thing is, because I don't know what's healthy and unhealthy, you love being on Reddit,

20:12.600 --> 20:18.600
you go through it and you're not just Reddit looking for your own name and looking at your own subreddit and things,

20:18.600 --> 20:25.600
but now you're on Reddit and all of a sudden this thing that's a big part of your life is like, I would assume,

20:25.600 --> 20:29.600
or are you ghoulishly, self-loathingly scouring that stuff?

20:29.600 --> 20:37.600
There's a certain amount of ego that when tens of thousands of people are looking at something that you made,

20:37.600 --> 20:44.600
it feels good even if people are shitting on it, but it just makes you question humanity.

20:44.600 --> 20:52.600
Who takes the time to, even though it's so easy to click on the YouTube comment and leave something shitty,

20:52.600 --> 20:56.600
but who actually puts that energy into it, although I guess thinking about it now,

20:56.600 --> 21:03.600
I was telling you I was translating Russian, because someone leaves a comment on your video and it's in Russian

21:03.600 --> 21:09.600
and you're like, I know this is going to be bad, but I'm still going to Google translate it.

21:09.600 --> 21:14.600
I guess it was something along the lines of you fucking suck.

21:14.600 --> 21:21.600
In Russia, bad band kills you.

21:21.600 --> 21:27.600
Well, that's another weird thing, when you are scrolling through things,

21:27.600 --> 21:30.600
it's the weirdest thing.

21:30.600 --> 21:38.600
People, I will skim through people being supportive, people being kind,

21:38.600 --> 21:42.600
saying a nice thing, and this is under normal circumstances.

21:42.600 --> 21:45.600
When I say something scandalous, I can't really go near it,

21:45.600 --> 21:48.600
and maybe that's the healthiest thing of the habit that I've picked up,

21:48.600 --> 21:59.600
but in olden times, when I was just a regular nobody that was excited about maybe someone talking about me once in a while,

21:59.600 --> 22:04.600
anything that I was involved in that I would scroll through and I was like,

22:04.600 --> 22:09.600
this is great phrases. I'm part of the problem too.

22:09.600 --> 22:11.600
I have to be honest about that.

22:11.600 --> 22:17.600
Even though that's a thing that's only happening in my secret part of my brain,

22:17.600 --> 22:22.600
I'm not taking any action about that, but when people tweet me and try to be obnoxious

22:22.600 --> 22:25.600
and say something mean to me to get my attention,

22:25.600 --> 22:34.600
and then I say, hey, why don't you go fuck yourself? You're a poop face. You're dumb, and you're wrong, and you're an idiot,

22:34.600 --> 22:39.600
and you're my mate of rubber, and your mom's an idiot.

22:39.600 --> 22:44.600
And then they go, ooh, got a rise out of you, and you're like, yeah, you did.

22:44.600 --> 22:46.600
Fuck, you still eat poop.

22:46.600 --> 22:52.600
Take your rise out of me and the poop that you eat, and see what a dad's up to.

22:52.600 --> 22:56.600
I don't know. And they're like, look, man, just kidding, I'm just a big fan.

22:56.600 --> 23:00.600
I just knew that if I kissed your ass, it wouldn't be, you know, like, that's not how it's like.

23:00.600 --> 23:06.600
Some people say that, or other people will go like, look, I'm sorry, I'm just not another sycophantic fan person.

23:06.600 --> 23:11.600
I really want those people to die in a fire.

23:11.600 --> 23:20.600
I don't really. For the transcript, I'm just trying to put the laughs in the transcript.

23:20.600 --> 23:25.600
It's a transcript of a live show with an audience. Put the laughs in.

23:25.600 --> 23:30.600
That's important.

23:30.600 --> 23:37.600
It's like reading Eminem lyrics on CNN, you know?

23:37.600 --> 23:41.600
It's always going to sound bad, man.

23:41.600 --> 23:47.600
I am not an appealing man.

23:47.600 --> 23:50.600
Shit, shit, shit. I lost my train of thought.

23:50.600 --> 23:55.600
You guys don't want me to regain my train of thought because I was on some stupid tangent that was taking forever.

23:55.600 --> 23:59.600
You were talking about looking for the negative.

23:59.600 --> 24:01.600
Yes, come, Charlene, yes.

24:01.600 --> 24:07.600
Yes, when I was doing stand-up before I quit, if there was one person standing in the back of the room going like this,

24:07.600 --> 24:09.600
like, I can't keep my eye off of them.

24:09.600 --> 24:14.600
I don't know, when you guys do live gigs, do you pay attention to how people are reacting to you in the back of the room?

24:14.600 --> 24:16.600
I used to. I just look at my guitar now.

24:16.600 --> 24:21.600
We've only played three shows here in LA, but it's been super positive for the most part.

24:21.600 --> 24:24.600
When we were in the Midwest, people fucking hated us.

24:24.600 --> 24:29.600
People just walk out on us, but we're like, everyone has beers and wearing flannel shirts,

24:29.600 --> 24:34.600
and we have angel wings and leopard print and sparkles, so that makes sense.

24:34.600 --> 24:38.600
For the most part, it's been super positive, and then that was kind of the weird thing,

24:38.600 --> 24:41.600
is this video was kind of showcasing my new band.

24:41.600 --> 24:42.600
We're all fired up.

24:42.600 --> 24:43.600
Yeah, check this out, man.

24:43.600 --> 24:48.600
We're really happy about it, and then we put it online where, like, slam, you know?

24:48.600 --> 24:52.600
The cool thing is that people had such a big reaction to it.

24:52.600 --> 24:53.600
It didn't disappear.

24:53.600 --> 25:05.600
It's so strange, like, never previously in, like, humanity has a person or a poor little girl.

25:05.600 --> 25:06.600
Like, had to deal...

25:06.600 --> 25:08.600
I'm not on my own. I'm not that poor.

25:08.600 --> 25:13.600
No one's ever had to deal with that amount of, like, these little, like, I think Duncan

25:13.600 --> 25:17.600
Trussell calls them moments of novelty, like, these tiny little...

25:17.600 --> 25:22.600
And, like, when they're just, like, constantly coming at you, and it's like, you cannot...

25:22.600 --> 25:27.600
I don't care who you are, you cannot stop yourself when your phone's buzzing like crazy.

25:27.600 --> 25:30.600
You cannot stop yourself from reading it.

25:30.600 --> 25:31.600
You just can't.

25:31.600 --> 25:33.600
I mean, I have been able to now...

25:33.600 --> 25:36.600
I just don't go to...

25:36.600 --> 25:40.600
I do it, but that's because I have done this five times now, at least.

25:40.600 --> 25:41.600
Like, I just...

25:41.600 --> 25:42.600
It's always...

25:42.600 --> 25:49.600
My 40 years in counting now, just, like, like, God telling me to say stuff.

25:49.600 --> 25:51.600
Everyone telling me to shut up.

25:51.600 --> 26:00.600
Me saying, but God said it, and then absolutely regretting saying that.

26:00.600 --> 26:08.600
I'm just trying to say how I feel, because if I don't say anything, like, I'm no good

26:08.600 --> 26:13.600
to anybody, and whether it's typing things or saying things.

26:13.600 --> 26:16.600
But, like, I've been...

26:16.600 --> 26:23.600
Yeah, anyways, that's a dumb tangent, but I did want to say to you guys because, I mean,

26:23.600 --> 26:28.600
you're virtual strangers to me, and I just thought the story was so interesting because

26:28.600 --> 26:32.600
it kind of, like, it was just a similar thing was happening to me, and it's, like, around

26:32.600 --> 26:34.600
the theme of this phenomenon, which is...

26:34.600 --> 26:35.600
I don't...

26:35.600 --> 26:37.600
There's no heroes or villains in the story.

26:37.600 --> 26:38.600
It's just...

26:38.600 --> 26:39.600
It's like the weather changing.

26:39.600 --> 26:40.600
It's like global warming.

26:40.600 --> 26:41.600
This is a thing that's happening now.

26:41.600 --> 26:47.600
We are all connected to each other, and thank God there's no FCC, like, channeling the whole

26:47.600 --> 26:52.600
thing through one little tiny thing, because then we'd all just be watching 75-year-old

26:52.600 --> 26:55.600
David Hasselhoff read bedtime stories on the Internet.

26:55.600 --> 27:01.600
And he'd still be in a scandal once in a while, but he'd be trained to handle it or whatever.

27:01.600 --> 27:08.600
But, like, thank God the gates are open, and we're all rushing together in this big throng.

27:08.600 --> 27:09.600
But just as...

27:09.600 --> 27:14.600
Like, when you go to a crowded, like, music hall and see a band that has a high tempo,

27:14.600 --> 27:20.600
there's always some dick in the audience that starts elbowing, and, you know, like, I...

27:20.600 --> 27:25.600
The anonymity and the frustration of not having control over your own life makes tiny parts

27:25.600 --> 27:30.600
of tiny individuals do these things that, when added all up, create this dandruff that

27:30.600 --> 27:34.600
can choke you and make you feel ugly about everything.

27:34.600 --> 27:38.600
But, first of all, there's not a single...

27:38.600 --> 27:42.600
I truly don't believe that there's a single whole individual out there that actually is

27:42.600 --> 27:43.600
that ugly.

27:43.600 --> 27:44.600
I think that...

27:44.600 --> 27:49.600
I think we just use the Internet as a weird, eyes-wide shut toilet, like, because we can't...

27:49.600 --> 27:52.600
Like, because it's this syndrome.

27:52.600 --> 27:55.600
It's because the more highly visible you are.

27:55.600 --> 27:57.600
And by the way, we're supposed to...

27:57.600 --> 27:59.600
We're telling high school kids it gets better.

27:59.600 --> 28:01.600
Like, are you supposed to tell that to Rebecca Black?

28:01.600 --> 28:03.600
Like, that it gets better?

28:03.600 --> 28:06.600
You're going to have 45-year-old men telling you you're a shitty singer?

28:06.600 --> 28:07.600
It gets better?

28:07.600 --> 28:08.600
Yeah.

28:08.600 --> 28:10.600
She knows it doesn't get better.

28:10.600 --> 28:12.600
Hopefully, it does get better.

28:12.600 --> 28:15.600
But, like, man, I'm all over the place.

28:15.600 --> 28:17.600
You learned how to handle it better.

28:17.600 --> 28:18.600
You know I didn't.

28:18.600 --> 28:19.600
No, I didn't.

28:19.600 --> 28:21.600
I know, I know.

28:21.600 --> 28:27.600
But, what I wanted to say to you guys is I clicked on your thing.

28:27.600 --> 28:28.600
I watched the video.

28:28.600 --> 28:29.600
I'm like, oh, cool song.

28:29.600 --> 28:31.600
Sounds like my phone's ringing for a second.

28:31.600 --> 28:32.600
Awesome idea.

28:32.600 --> 28:41.600
Like, and then reading the comments, it's like, they were all so pointless to me because I'm

28:41.600 --> 28:43.600
absolutely outside the situation.

28:43.600 --> 28:45.600
There's nothing personal about it for me.

28:45.600 --> 28:49.600
Like, I scoured because I wanted to talk to you guys about what's the worst one.

28:49.600 --> 28:57.600
Like, I can see, I can see that if someone's saying like, stupid idea, bad music, singers,

28:57.600 --> 29:10.600
ugly, voice and face, turn your hat around, stop singing forever and cut yourself in your

29:10.600 --> 29:15.600
face and it'll look better because your face is worse than a cut face.

29:15.600 --> 29:23.100
Like, to you, it's like, I can say that and they can laugh because they know it's a joke

29:23.100 --> 29:28.600
and I know it's a joke to those, like, those concepts.

29:28.600 --> 29:34.600
You're seeing it from some anonymous stranger and the only difference is you're projecting

29:34.600 --> 29:39.600
onto it like, oh, shit, like, what if they really mean that?

29:39.600 --> 29:43.600
It's like, they just, they're just in a sad part of their life.

29:43.600 --> 29:48.600
Like, just having some weird moment of weakness and they don't, none of it's true.

29:48.600 --> 29:49.600
None of it means anything.

29:49.600 --> 29:53.600
They're literally trying to make you feel exactly how you feel.

29:53.600 --> 29:55.600
There's almost an uplifting thing about that.

29:55.600 --> 29:58.600
It's still possible for us to touch each other.

29:58.600 --> 30:05.600
We're just doing it, we're using glory holes to put, we're putting spears through them.

30:05.600 --> 30:13.600
It's a misuse of the technology.

30:13.600 --> 30:25.600
It's clear what we should be doing and how we could all benefit.

30:25.600 --> 30:30.600
There's multiple levels though of how fucked up it is though because like, I mean, once

30:30.600 --> 30:38.600
you've read literally thousands and thousands of people telling you to kill yourself, now

30:38.600 --> 30:41.600
every time you read one, it's like, okay, yeah, whatever.

30:41.600 --> 30:45.600
But then sometimes you click the user and see, you actually see the person and now

30:45.600 --> 30:48.600
YouTube shows a photo a lot of times.

30:48.600 --> 30:53.600
But that's the part that kind of upsets me because then I see the person and I'm like,

30:53.600 --> 30:59.600
whoa, that is a human being and they in their free time are shitting on something that

30:59.600 --> 31:02.600
I'm doing for fun with my friends.

31:02.600 --> 31:05.600
But you know the great thing about that is you can further click on them and see the

31:05.600 --> 31:09.600
comments they're leaving and you can see the mental state that they're in.

31:09.600 --> 31:13.600
So we picked a couple of them out and we're just like, wow, they're doing, at least it's

31:13.600 --> 31:15.600
not just me, but I don't know.

31:15.600 --> 31:17.600
You showed me because I was upset.

31:17.600 --> 31:23.600
I mean, it's like any type of creative profession, like as you know, the last thing you need

31:23.600 --> 31:28.600
is someone saying stop because everyone along the way in our lives has said fucking stop.

31:28.600 --> 31:30.600
Yeah, everything in your head says stop.

31:30.600 --> 31:31.600
Exactly.

31:31.600 --> 31:34.600
You don't need another reason to be more critical of yourself.

31:34.600 --> 31:40.600
Well, you guys do me a huge, huge favor and all of society a huge favor and use the emotional

31:40.600 --> 31:46.600
experience of being told to stop by people that don't really mean stop to create more

31:46.600 --> 31:51.600
songs about how it feels to be told to stop or something.

31:51.600 --> 31:56.600
Because if enough of us start doing that, if enough of us make humanity boring enough

31:56.600 --> 32:03.600
to other people, like maybe with the parts of us that hate ourselves, I think that a

32:03.600 --> 32:08.600
lot of us have to get up in the morning and go to bed at night never having told the truth.

32:08.600 --> 32:12.600
And I think that a lot of times it's not their fault either.

32:12.600 --> 32:17.600
And I think that you guys and me, we're in the unique position to be able to, you know,

32:17.600 --> 32:21.600
we can tell the truth about how we feel and just say weird shit and let the chips fall

32:21.600 --> 32:22.600
where they may.

32:22.600 --> 32:30.600
And we kind of have to keep doing it so otherwise like if we stop, then 9-Eleven happens again.

32:30.600 --> 32:34.600
And you can quote me on that.

32:34.600 --> 32:36.600
Vulture.com.

32:36.600 --> 32:40.600
Do you guys have anything to promote or anything?

32:40.600 --> 32:42.600
You want anyone to know about anything you're doing?

32:42.600 --> 32:46.600
You're just plucking your little guitars and singing your hearts out.

32:46.600 --> 32:47.600
Yeah.

32:47.600 --> 32:50.600
You can check out our YouTube channel.

32:50.600 --> 32:51.600
I think it's pretty cool.

32:51.600 --> 32:52.600
You can go to grocerybag.tv.

32:52.600 --> 32:53.600
Maybe YouTube channel.

32:53.600 --> 32:55.600
We do these things called computer shows.

32:55.600 --> 32:56.600
Yeah.

32:56.600 --> 32:57.600
And soundgrocerbag.tv.

32:57.600 --> 32:58.600
All right.

32:58.600 --> 32:59.600
Awesome.

32:59.600 --> 33:00.600
Mars Argo.

33:00.600 --> 33:01.600
Thank you for coming by.

33:01.600 --> 33:02.600
Thank you.

33:02.600 --> 33:03.600
Thank you for having us.

33:03.600 --> 33:15.600
It's a good song.

33:15.600 --> 33:18.600
I like the refrain.

33:18.600 --> 33:20.600
I like her voice.

33:20.600 --> 33:29.600
You know, you were not born yet, but in the 90s, I was a, as you have discovered, I was

33:29.600 --> 33:34.600
a big fan of the female kind of very emotional, passionate Tonya Donnelly's.

33:34.600 --> 33:38.600
I like when you touch your chest as if to mind breath.

33:38.600 --> 33:41.600
I am miming passion coming out.

33:41.600 --> 33:43.600
I'm not miming boobs.

33:43.600 --> 33:49.600
I'm a big fan of Tonya Donnelly throwing muses and toriemas.

33:49.600 --> 33:52.600
I'm just cupping my breasts.

33:52.600 --> 33:54.600
I like pain.

33:54.600 --> 33:55.600
I like...

33:55.600 --> 33:57.600
You like feminine pain?

33:57.600 --> 33:58.600
Oh, God.

33:58.600 --> 33:59.600
Yes.

33:59.600 --> 34:00.600
Oh, God.

34:00.600 --> 34:01.600
No, no, no.

34:01.600 --> 34:02.600
Yes.

34:02.600 --> 34:03.600
Good one.

34:03.600 --> 34:04.600
Nice.

34:04.600 --> 34:05.600
Don't worry.

34:05.600 --> 34:06.600
I'll write a letter apologizing for you.

34:06.600 --> 34:16.600
It's pretty hard for a guy to have my number vocally in a song I find.

34:16.600 --> 34:17.600
Yeah.

34:17.600 --> 34:22.960
I like being upstairs, working on something, and hearing the cranberries echo throughout

34:22.960 --> 34:27.600
the house, and come down and see you in a bubble bath.

34:27.600 --> 34:29.600
It's nice.

34:29.600 --> 34:32.600
You are very sensitive.

34:32.600 --> 34:34.600
You're not very macho at all.

34:34.600 --> 34:36.600
It's nice.

34:36.600 --> 34:51.600
It's like having a sister.

34:51.600 --> 34:54.600
To that, it is funny to think about our gender roles in our relationship.

34:54.600 --> 34:57.600
Our gender roles?

34:57.600 --> 34:58.600
Our gender roles.

34:58.600 --> 34:59.600
Oh, gender roles.

34:59.600 --> 35:00.600
Our roles.

35:00.600 --> 35:02.600
I'm kind of the handyman.

35:02.600 --> 35:09.600
Well, I took off that door that one time while you sat at the bar and told me I couldn't.

35:09.600 --> 35:11.600
Because it was as you said, a two-man job.

35:11.600 --> 35:15.600
So I guess I'm sometimes pretty manly.

35:15.600 --> 35:16.600
Yeah, yeah.

35:16.600 --> 35:20.600
I'm as manly as two men by your definition.

35:20.600 --> 35:22.600
I did a two-man job.

35:22.600 --> 35:24.600
I was really impressed by that.

35:24.600 --> 35:28.600
Also really impressed by the doggie gate that you put at the top of the stairs.

35:28.600 --> 35:29.600
Thank you.

35:29.600 --> 35:30.600
Yeah.

35:30.600 --> 35:33.600
It was a big sheet of instructions that came with that.

35:33.600 --> 35:35.600
Did you look at them?

35:35.600 --> 35:36.600
Yeah, of course not.

35:36.600 --> 35:37.600
I followed them.

35:37.600 --> 35:38.600
Yeah, that's so nice.

35:38.600 --> 35:46.600
You know, first I issued a press release about how the company that made the doggie gate was a bunch of blood-sucking rich assholes.

35:46.600 --> 35:52.600
But then one of them emailed me and said his feelings were hurt, so I installed the doggie gate.

35:52.600 --> 35:57.600
I eventually do what I'm supposed to do, and humanity benefits.

35:57.600 --> 35:58.600
I like that.

35:58.600 --> 35:59.600
I like that you read the directions.

35:59.600 --> 36:07.600
I had a couple handymen over to the house when you haven't been there.

36:07.600 --> 36:11.600
To set up different things around the house, and they all...

36:11.600 --> 36:15.600
There have been like three of them.

36:15.600 --> 36:19.600
There was Chad, Brock, and Nick.

36:19.600 --> 36:20.600
Well, all those...

36:20.600 --> 36:21.600
Joel.

36:21.600 --> 36:23.600
Joel? Why Joel?

36:23.600 --> 36:25.600
Oh, Joel McHale?

36:25.600 --> 36:26.600
That's interesting.

36:26.600 --> 36:31.600
I think that guy just has a similar fantasy of just calling out.

36:31.600 --> 36:36.600
He's just like, make this perfect for me.

36:36.600 --> 36:43.600
Make it my high school math teacher.

36:43.600 --> 36:44.600
Don't stop.

36:44.600 --> 36:47.600
Don't stop just short of what I wrote.

36:47.600 --> 36:48.600
These are TaskRabbit.

36:48.600 --> 36:51.600
Does anyone use TaskRabbit or know what TaskRabbit is?

36:51.600 --> 36:52.600
Yes.

36:52.600 --> 36:57.600
TaskRabbit is the grub hub of indentured servitude.

36:57.600 --> 37:00.600
Well, and I've had some guys come over and help me put together furniture and stuff,

37:00.600 --> 37:03.600
and each and every one of them has made a show out of like,

37:03.600 --> 37:05.600
these directions, no good.

37:05.600 --> 37:06.600
And throwing them to the side.

37:06.600 --> 37:08.600
I'm like, all right, well...

37:08.600 --> 37:09.600
I mean, I agree.

37:09.600 --> 37:11.600
They're very confusing, but those guys are above them.

37:11.600 --> 37:12.600
I'm below them.

37:12.600 --> 37:15.600
I'm like, these directions be no good.

37:15.600 --> 37:21.600
Well, you know, John the handyman, I asked him if he could take your gate off that you installed,

37:21.600 --> 37:23.600
and he was working on it for like a half hour.

37:23.600 --> 37:25.600
He's like, I don't know how he did it, but I cannot get it off.

37:25.600 --> 37:27.600
He said, well, he's the one that's a community fan, right?

37:27.600 --> 37:29.600
He was probably like, did Dan Harmon install this gate?

37:29.600 --> 37:31.600
I'm sorry, I can't.

37:35.600 --> 37:37.600
There's something about it.

37:37.600 --> 37:39.600
I just like the way it feels.

37:39.600 --> 37:41.600
It has more heart.

37:44.600 --> 37:45.600
Oh my God.

37:45.600 --> 37:47.600
Dan, do you know what time it is?

37:47.600 --> 37:49.600
It's...

37:49.600 --> 37:51.600
It's...

37:53.600 --> 37:55.600
8.52.

37:59.600 --> 38:02.600
It's game corner time.

38:04.600 --> 38:06.600
Can we get Kumail Nashiani on the stage?

38:06.600 --> 38:08.600
Kumail.

38:10.600 --> 38:14.600
Kumail Hills from beautiful Pakistan, where...

38:14.600 --> 38:16.600
Kumail call.

38:16.600 --> 38:17.600
What did you just say?

38:17.600 --> 38:19.600
Kumail call?

38:19.600 --> 38:21.600
I like that.

38:21.600 --> 38:22.600
I've never heard that.

38:22.600 --> 38:25.600
I've heard you've got Kumail, which...

38:25.600 --> 38:26.600
That's better.

38:26.600 --> 38:27.600
It's pretty great.

38:27.600 --> 38:29.600
Have you ever heard you had me at Kumail?

38:29.600 --> 38:30.600
That doesn't make any sense.

38:30.600 --> 38:31.600
No.

38:31.600 --> 38:32.600
No.

38:32.600 --> 38:33.600
No, go ahead, make my Kumail.

38:33.600 --> 38:34.600
I haven't heard that.

38:34.600 --> 38:36.600
You're going off the Kumail.

38:36.600 --> 38:38.600
Get off my Kumail plane?

38:38.600 --> 38:39.600
Nope.

38:39.600 --> 38:41.600
Get off my Kumail plane.

38:41.600 --> 38:43.600
We're going to need a bigger Kumail boat?

38:43.600 --> 38:45.600
Yeah, that I have heard.

38:45.600 --> 38:46.600
Weird.

38:46.600 --> 38:48.600
I was in a weird job situation.

38:48.600 --> 38:50.600
When you're sick, do you have a Kumailant?

38:50.600 --> 38:52.600
A Kumail?

38:52.600 --> 38:54.600
Welcome to the game!

38:56.600 --> 38:58.600
I want to say a couple things, but should we do the game first?

38:58.600 --> 39:00.600
No, you can say a couple things.

39:00.600 --> 39:03.600
Do you mind if I put some music underneath it?

39:03.600 --> 39:04.600
No, I shouldn't.

39:04.600 --> 39:05.600
Go ahead.

39:05.600 --> 39:08.600
I wanted to read this because, first of all, can I say something, Dan?

39:08.600 --> 39:10.600
You're talking about Steve Levitan being handsome.

39:10.600 --> 39:12.600
He's a very handsome man.

39:12.600 --> 39:14.600
You look fucking great these days.

39:14.600 --> 39:16.600
Thanks, buddy.

39:16.600 --> 39:22.600
It looks like a fun top gun vibe to it.

39:22.600 --> 39:29.600
I finally learned after 40 years that I need to never just wear a t-shirt because my posture is so bad.

39:29.600 --> 39:32.600
I have this weird...

39:32.600 --> 39:34.600
I'm like a circus bear.

39:34.600 --> 39:37.600
Especially viewed in profile.

39:37.600 --> 39:39.600
I really need to...

39:39.600 --> 39:40.600
But go on.

39:40.600 --> 39:41.600
But no.

39:41.600 --> 39:42.600
You look great.

39:42.600 --> 39:44.600
You're Peter Jackson-ing right now.

39:46.600 --> 39:48.600
That's a good thing.

39:48.600 --> 39:50.600
I mean, you know, because he...

39:50.600 --> 39:52.600
He shot in New Zealand.

39:52.600 --> 39:54.600
Yeah, and now he wears shoes and everything.

39:56.600 --> 39:59.600
It was a long time where he wasn't wearing shoes.

39:59.600 --> 40:00.600
I told you this.

40:00.600 --> 40:08.600
I think I told the story on this show when I went to Comic-Con and the workaholics guys, very funny guys,

40:08.600 --> 40:16.600
I was talking to them for a while and then people were gathered around us and they walked away after a while.

40:16.600 --> 40:18.600
You know, it's like conversations kind of ebb and flow.

40:18.600 --> 40:23.600
They left the conversation circle and I was stuck with some other people.

40:23.600 --> 40:32.600
And this one guy just really enamored with me and started asking me more and more specific questions about when I shoot stuff,

40:32.600 --> 40:39.600
like what I'm thinking and I was really flattered by it and like, well, you know, I just try, hey, at the end of the day, it's just stuff, you know?

40:39.600 --> 40:43.600
And then he started asking about New Zealand and...

40:43.600 --> 40:45.600
Oh, no!

40:49.600 --> 40:52.600
And I went like, I've never been to New Zealand and he went like, yeah, you have.

40:52.600 --> 40:54.600
You have an American accent.

40:56.600 --> 40:57.600
So many clues.

40:57.600 --> 41:03.600
And he went like, you've never been to New Zealand.

41:03.600 --> 41:04.600
And I was like, no.

41:04.600 --> 41:08.600
And then he looked and his face like contorted into anger.

41:08.600 --> 41:16.600
I felt at me, anger at me, pointed at the giggling workaholic guys on the other side of the party.

41:16.600 --> 41:17.600
Oh!

41:17.600 --> 41:26.600
Those guys told me you were Peter Jackson, which is, I mean, I'm not usually a fan of practical joke.

41:26.600 --> 41:27.600
That's a good one.

41:27.600 --> 41:29.600
That's funny shit, man.

41:29.600 --> 41:31.600
I will forever remember them.

41:31.600 --> 41:32.600
Yeah.

41:32.600 --> 41:43.600
The furniture thing, I'm like not handy at all also, but I have this thing, like, if I get started on something, Emily's not handy either, so we both are not handy.

41:43.600 --> 41:45.600
I'm not going to hurt anyone.

41:45.600 --> 41:49.600
No, no, no, I was going to, whatever, what's it, something rabbits? What are they called?

41:49.600 --> 41:50.600
The people that come in?

41:50.600 --> 41:51.600
Oh, the TaskRabbit.

41:51.600 --> 41:53.600
The Jowls and the Chads of the World?

41:53.600 --> 41:55.600
Yes, Jowl, Chad, Nick.

41:55.600 --> 42:02.600
So I got this, we got this awesome desk and put it together and I was like, I'm going to fucking finish this today.

42:02.600 --> 42:07.600
And I got so like worked up trying to finish this. This is completely true.

42:07.600 --> 42:18.600
Emily walked in two hours later and I was completely naked, sweating from everywhere, just like punching a board.

42:18.600 --> 42:27.600
Because I got so, I'm like, I'm physically bigger than it, I should be able to have power over it.

42:27.600 --> 42:32.600
I did that too, I was trying to move a chair through a door and that's why I got in this big play with Eric.

42:32.600 --> 42:33.600
Oh my god.

42:33.600 --> 42:36.600
He was like, that's a two-man job, you need to take that door off, that's a two-man job.

42:36.600 --> 42:38.600
And I was like, you know, I just got back.

42:38.600 --> 42:39.600
That's like you're like, you know.

42:39.600 --> 42:44.600
I was practically naked too, because you're just sweating and you just, I was like, one thing I can't control, it's stupid clothes.

42:44.600 --> 42:46.600
Yeah.

42:46.600 --> 42:52.600
Yeah, you're like, do you two-man job is like Marty McFly's chicken, you know.

42:52.600 --> 42:54.600
Like if you hear two-man job.

42:54.600 --> 42:56.600
God damn it, can I tell you, this is eating away at me.

42:56.600 --> 43:01.600
Okay, I took the closet door off the hinges.

43:01.600 --> 43:03.600
It was lighter and easier to get off.

43:03.600 --> 43:09.600
It was a two-man job, the door that you said.

43:09.600 --> 43:15.600
I figured out a different door I could take off that was not so much a two-man job.

43:15.600 --> 43:20.600
But the principle of the thing is, you didn't believe in me.

43:20.600 --> 43:33.600
You know what, I guess turns out coming clean is a one-man job.

43:33.600 --> 43:41.600
I was literally about to say, he moved a very heavy door and put it back on its hinges perfectly, which is amazing.

43:41.600 --> 43:45.600
But you know what, he figured out how to get around it.

43:45.600 --> 43:47.600
And isn't that just as important?

43:47.600 --> 43:49.600
He also figured out how to.

43:49.600 --> 43:53.600
There's going to be the guy with the eye patch that's creepy and has like fish tanks full of heads and stuff.

43:53.600 --> 43:57.600
You want to stick with the old, who am I?

43:57.600 --> 43:59.600
I think I'm the old man that lost his leg.

43:59.600 --> 44:05.600
I have something to say about the handyman, Nick and Joel.

44:05.600 --> 44:10.600
I have something to tell you about all those nanny cams.

44:10.600 --> 44:14.600
That's why we're getting free labor.

44:14.600 --> 44:18.600
This whole thing, everyone's winning.

44:18.600 --> 44:26.600
I was going to say, you guys were talking about feedback online and I've talked about how I always get racist stuff on Twitter.

44:26.600 --> 44:30.600
And the thing that a lot of people say, I think I've mentioned it here, people say, go back to India.

44:30.600 --> 44:34.600
And I always say, I've never been there, I'm not Indian.

44:34.600 --> 44:38.600
Are you just wishing an awesome vacation for me?

44:38.600 --> 44:42.600
Yeah.

44:42.600 --> 44:46.600
But this one, I want to read this one tweet I got yesterday because I was tweeting about Paula Deen.

44:46.600 --> 44:50.600
I'm sorry, why do they want you to go back to India?

44:50.600 --> 44:54.600
Do they want your job that you're taking?

44:54.600 --> 44:56.600
Are you welding cars?

44:56.600 --> 45:00.600
If I say anything political, they'll be like, go back to India.

45:00.600 --> 45:04.600
So yesterday I was tweeting about Paula Deen.

45:04.600 --> 45:08.600
Well, just from my picture, they were like, all right, that's what an Indian guy looks like.

45:08.600 --> 45:12.600
That is what it is. I'm very easily Google-able.

45:12.600 --> 45:16.600
There's not many other Kumail Nanjianis who are from India to confuse them.

45:16.600 --> 45:20.600
I'm just saying, if you're being racist, fucking be accurate.

45:20.600 --> 45:22.600
Yeah.

45:22.600 --> 45:28.600
But I got this one because I was tweeting about Paula Deen yesterday because I genuinely think she's a bad person.

45:28.600 --> 45:34.600
I want to read this because it's the most densely racist thing that I've ever read.

45:34.600 --> 45:37.600
It's so few letters. This is what he says.

45:37.600 --> 45:39.600
I was tweeting about her being racist and he says,

45:39.600 --> 45:44.600
unfortunate, but every race has rampant racism per meeting their cultures.

45:44.600 --> 45:47.600
Now, this sentence is my favorite. This is what he says.

45:47.600 --> 45:51.600
Indians are very racist to others.

45:51.600 --> 45:54.600
I'll tell you why I love this.

45:54.600 --> 45:56.600
One, he calls me Indian when I'm Pakistani.

45:56.600 --> 45:59.600
So already, the first word, he's already racist.

45:59.600 --> 46:08.600
Also, if the purest form of racism is attributing a characteristic to a race because there are certain race.

46:08.600 --> 46:17.600
So him saying Indians are very racist to others, he's being purely racist while using the word racist.

46:17.600 --> 46:20.600
It's like a mobius strip of racism.

46:20.600 --> 46:22.600
He's the Charlie Kaufman of racism.

46:22.600 --> 46:25.600
Yeah. It's so good.

46:25.600 --> 46:33.600
I do think a lot of problems could be solved if we just decide whether it's true or not,

46:33.600 --> 46:42.600
but let's just break the cycle and just say, okay, white people are more racist genetically.

46:42.600 --> 46:48.600
I just stopped the conversation, just go, okay, all right, all right, we found the problem.

46:48.600 --> 46:52.600
White people have a gene for racism and then we can all go,

46:52.600 --> 46:58.600
because even if that's not true, we can use that as an excuse to just stop the cycle,

46:58.600 --> 47:05.600
like the weird spiraling argument because the problem is like a 14-year-old white girl in line at the mall

47:05.600 --> 47:08.600
that has some weird culture clash moment.

47:08.600 --> 47:17.600
She's 14. She doesn't have the geopolitical fucking backbone and the experience to deal with all this stuff.

47:17.600 --> 47:21.600
She's going to say something equally weird and stuff, but she's white.

47:21.600 --> 47:26.600
So she's going to say something horribly racist in defense of her ego, which all 14-year-olds have.

47:26.600 --> 47:32.600
So if we all just passed a law that said, okay, we decided, we found it, we found the racist gene.

47:32.600 --> 47:33.600
White people have it.

47:33.600 --> 47:36.600
And you're going to be like, that's our struggle, white people struggle.

47:36.600 --> 47:39.600
Yeah, it's hard. It's hard to be racist.

47:39.600 --> 47:41.600
We have to put our comment.

47:41.600 --> 47:45.600
And you're going to be like, it's like your sickle selenemia. See, we're doing it again.

47:45.600 --> 47:49.600
See, you get it. You get it, yes. It would all solve itself.

47:49.600 --> 47:54.600
You know how you smell like curry? See, we can't help it.

47:54.600 --> 48:00.600
Because you know what we're doing right now? We're doing almost the opposite with the diversity movement.

48:00.600 --> 48:02.600
And please don't misinterpret this.

48:02.600 --> 48:05.600
I think, for instance, NBC's diversity program, I've said many, many times.

48:05.600 --> 48:08.600
I get so many emails from them and I never signed up for it.

48:08.600 --> 48:10.600
I don't know how this happened.

48:10.600 --> 48:19.600
It's okay. I think that pro-action in a climate where obviously there is a long-standing momentum of things not getting done.

48:19.600 --> 48:26.600
I don't think that scientifically this thing's better than the other, but I think doing anything at all is better than doing nothing.

48:26.600 --> 48:28.600
And so I want to be very clear about that.

48:28.600 --> 48:31.600
I'm not one of these people that's like, uh, affirmative action is reverse racism.

48:31.600 --> 48:33.600
It's dumb, dumb, dumb.

48:33.600 --> 48:36.600
But I just want to point out one thing.

48:36.600 --> 48:39.600
You're not saying affirmative action is dumb. You're saying that saying that is dumb.

48:39.600 --> 48:42.600
Yes. Thank you for being here.

48:42.600 --> 48:43.600
Thank you.

48:43.600 --> 48:46.600
Can you just walk around with me?

48:46.600 --> 48:49.600
I was going to say in a backpack, but then people would go,

48:49.600 --> 48:53.600
Dan Harmon tells a Pakistani guy to be in his backpack.

48:53.600 --> 48:55.600
Here's the transcript.

48:55.600 --> 48:57.600
He gave me three wishes.

49:00.600 --> 49:03.600
I wish for a thousand Pakistanis.

49:05.600 --> 49:08.600
That's my white jean. I'm inscrubulous.

49:08.600 --> 49:14.600
Because I can see the quote from that would be, Affirmative action ellipses, dumb, dumb, dumb.

49:14.600 --> 49:16.600
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course. No, no, no, no.

49:16.600 --> 49:24.600
I'm not one of those libertarian kind of white guys that's like, like, uh, I don't think that

49:24.600 --> 49:36.600
Spock-like logic in the face of a huge legacy and momentum of disproportionality in certain job spaces is the solution.

49:36.600 --> 49:40.600
I think that some of the solutions are not going to be logical.

49:40.600 --> 49:45.600
They're going to be like, everybody stand on this side of the boat, like to try to counteract some of this stuff.

49:45.600 --> 49:56.600
So that being said, I just wanted to have what make the coy cutesy observation that I think the driving force behind the concept of diversity,

49:56.600 --> 50:02.600
like the diversity movement, if you could call it that, like, is it me or is there like,

50:02.600 --> 50:09.600
is there a way to interpret all of this, like a subtle implication is that only white people have the power to end racism?

50:09.600 --> 50:15.600
Well, I mean, here's why that is sort of a thing that's implied is because white people,

50:15.600 --> 50:21.600
because racism is all about, and all bigotry, it's about sort of power differentials, right?

50:21.600 --> 50:29.600
And so if I, that's why, you know, like a black person being racist against a white person is not as harmful, really,

50:29.600 --> 50:32.600
as a white person being racist against a black person because white people have power.

50:32.600 --> 50:41.600
So because white people in America have the power, that's why it's usually sort of not the job of white people,

50:41.600 --> 50:44.600
but they're the ones who I think in effect, the most change.

50:44.600 --> 50:46.600
Yeah, exactly.

50:46.600 --> 50:51.600
And right now, it's like a little in the absence of just say, yeah, maybe it's cartoonish.

50:51.600 --> 50:52.600
I'm probably not being serious.

50:52.600 --> 50:57.600
But honestly, if some scientist, if a scientist can pretend that Brontosaurus has existed,

50:57.600 --> 51:02.600
and it's just like, like one scientist got like, I found the racism gene.

51:02.600 --> 51:05.600
I found a gene in the Caucasoid bloodstream.

51:05.600 --> 51:06.600
Yeah.

51:06.600 --> 51:09.600
It just, it makes you just a tad more racist.

51:09.600 --> 51:10.600
Yeah.

51:10.600 --> 51:20.600
So you, in order to counteract it, you have to, you have to force your poor, poor racist white blood to be a little less racist.

51:20.600 --> 51:22.600
It's a struggle that you have.

51:22.600 --> 51:24.600
Yeah, I'm beating a dead horse, but anyway.

51:24.600 --> 51:25.600
I think that's good.

51:25.600 --> 51:26.600
I like that idea.

51:26.600 --> 51:31.600
We should get one guy, have proof, and then his lab burns down and he dies.

51:31.600 --> 51:35.600
And he's the sacrifice for ending racism.

51:35.600 --> 51:37.600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

51:37.600 --> 51:39.600
This would be a great, like, yeah, Pelican brief kind of.

51:39.600 --> 51:40.600
He's done it.

51:40.600 --> 51:41.600
Thanks for coming to Harmontown.

51:41.600 --> 51:42.600
All right.

51:42.600 --> 51:43.600
Let's, let's, let's play.

51:43.600 --> 51:44.600
What's this game?

51:44.600 --> 51:45.600
Yeah, I'm excited.

51:45.600 --> 51:46.600
Game quarter.

51:46.600 --> 51:52.600
Aaron has a gene for game playing.

51:52.600 --> 51:56.600
Can I bring a Spencer to the stage, please?

51:56.600 --> 51:57.600
Spencer.

51:57.600 --> 51:58.600
Brendan.

51:58.600 --> 52:08.600
Hailing from the city near Los Angeles.

52:08.600 --> 52:11.600
Spencer's favorite time is bedtime.

52:11.600 --> 52:12.600
What?

52:12.600 --> 52:16.600
That timing was perfect.

52:16.600 --> 52:17.600
It was amazing.

52:17.600 --> 52:18.600
All right.

52:18.600 --> 52:20.600
So we're going to play, we're going to play a little game.

52:20.600 --> 52:23.600
It's going to be Dan against Kumail.

52:23.600 --> 52:27.600
And it's not necessary to this game, but it may enhance it.

52:27.600 --> 52:30.600
Can I have Adam Goldberg come to the stage?

52:30.600 --> 52:32.600
Wait, his brother is going to enhance something?

52:32.600 --> 52:33.600
Controversial figure, Adam Goldberg.

52:33.600 --> 52:40.600
Now I've heard everything.

52:40.600 --> 52:41.600
How's it going?

52:41.600 --> 52:42.600
How do you do it, Adam?

52:42.600 --> 52:43.600
Thank you.

52:43.600 --> 52:44.600
Thank you, Adam.

52:44.600 --> 52:46.600
I always want to not, you know, and then you say something nice.

52:46.600 --> 52:48.600
I'm like, all right, thanks.

52:48.600 --> 52:53.600
So this last week was Spencer's first week as your assistant.

52:53.600 --> 52:54.600
All right, yeah.

52:54.600 --> 52:56.600
Which I know.

52:56.600 --> 52:58.600
And he's amazing.

52:58.600 --> 52:59.600
He's great.

52:59.600 --> 53:03.600
Yeah, I've heard from both sides that it's going really well.

53:03.600 --> 53:06.600
Spencer's having a great time and Spencer's doing great.

53:06.600 --> 53:13.600
Spencer sits in the writer's room and it stares at me like a falcon.

53:13.600 --> 53:18.600
And at one point I needed to sit down two times as this happened.

53:18.600 --> 53:19.600
Yeah, two.

53:19.600 --> 53:21.600
Because I'm standing there talking to the writers.

53:21.600 --> 53:23.600
A huge writing staff this year.

53:23.600 --> 53:25.600
And I was like, there's no chair.

53:25.600 --> 53:30.600
And I kind of became conscious of my need for my fat butt to be supported by something.

53:30.600 --> 53:35.600
And this Viking man bounded up with a heavy chair and plopped it down.

53:35.600 --> 53:37.600
The writers were really impressed.

53:37.600 --> 53:39.600
They applauded.

53:39.600 --> 53:40.600
Yeah, they did.

53:40.600 --> 53:41.600
They applauded.

53:41.600 --> 53:46.600
That's assisting someone when you get applause for it.

53:46.600 --> 53:51.600
So it sounds like Spencer knows you very well and is anticipating your whims.

53:51.600 --> 53:54.600
But how well do you know Spencer?

53:54.600 --> 53:55.600
We're going to play a little game.

53:55.600 --> 53:59.600
No.

53:59.600 --> 54:01.600
We're in my world to mount.

54:01.600 --> 54:03.600
We're going to play a little.

54:03.600 --> 54:07.600
And Adam, for those of you who don't know, if you're just listening to this podcast for the first time,

54:07.600 --> 54:10.600
or if you're here from Variety or The Hollywood Reporter,

54:10.600 --> 54:17.600
Adam Goldberg is a controversial, Harmontown audience member, tenacious...

54:17.600 --> 54:18.600
Lightning Rod.

54:18.600 --> 54:20.600
Lightning Rod.

54:20.600 --> 54:21.600
Lightning Rod.

54:21.600 --> 54:29.600
Lightning Rod is weird because it's not the Rod's fault that it's happening.

54:29.600 --> 54:34.600
The Rod is not bringing it upon itself.

54:34.600 --> 54:40.600
The man I really don't like when other men refer to me as the Rod.

54:40.600 --> 54:41.600
Whatever.

54:41.600 --> 54:45.600
So we're going to...

54:45.600 --> 54:50.600
We're going to play a little game called Spencer or Adam.

54:50.600 --> 54:51.600
Oh, boy.

54:51.600 --> 54:54.600
All right.

54:54.600 --> 54:57.600
I will just say there was a guy when we were handing out cupcakes.

54:57.600 --> 55:02.600
There was a guy that was so obviously an entertainment blogger that had never been here before.

55:02.600 --> 55:04.600
There was this guy that just had this look.

55:04.600 --> 55:06.600
I'm really curious if he was or if he's just...

55:06.600 --> 55:07.600
Oh, tonight?

55:07.600 --> 55:08.600
Yeah.

55:08.600 --> 55:09.600
It just looks so out of place.

55:09.600 --> 55:12.600
It was so like just camping out here.

55:12.600 --> 55:13.600
Like, well...

55:13.600 --> 55:14.600
Hey, Superman.

55:14.600 --> 55:15.600
That's something I like.

55:15.600 --> 55:17.600
Harmontown.

55:17.600 --> 55:21.600
All right.

55:21.600 --> 55:22.600
Okay.

55:22.600 --> 55:24.600
So this is...

55:24.600 --> 55:30.600
I asked both Spencer and Adam the same series of questions.

55:30.600 --> 55:34.600
And what I'm going to do is I'm going to present a question and the answer.

55:34.600 --> 55:39.600
And Camille and Dan, you're going to say if it's Spencer or if it's Adam.

55:39.600 --> 55:42.600
This feels like it should be the easiest game of all time.

55:42.600 --> 55:45.600
But I bet it's not going to be.

55:45.600 --> 55:46.600
We'll see.

55:46.600 --> 55:47.600
All right.

55:47.600 --> 55:50.600
So let's go ahead and begin.

55:50.600 --> 55:54.600
The game will be done when it feels right for it to be over.

55:54.600 --> 55:56.600
We're out here then.

55:56.600 --> 56:00.600
Adam and Spencer try to contain yourselves.

56:00.600 --> 56:01.600
Yeah.

56:01.600 --> 56:04.600
Why are we necessary for this?

56:04.600 --> 56:06.600
Like to be...

56:06.600 --> 56:08.600
Well, as a visual.

56:08.600 --> 56:10.600
So people can see Adam or Spencer.

56:10.600 --> 56:11.600
Visual for the podcast.

56:11.600 --> 56:13.600
For the Vanna White.

56:13.600 --> 56:16.600
For the live audience.

56:16.600 --> 56:20.600
Let's read Spencer quotes and then have it be Spencer or Spencer.

56:20.600 --> 56:21.600
What?

56:21.600 --> 56:22.600
All right.

56:22.600 --> 56:23.600
I'll be back.

56:23.600 --> 56:24.600
I'll be back on half hour.

56:24.600 --> 56:26.600
I need the visual.

56:26.600 --> 56:28.600
Thank you for...

56:28.600 --> 56:29.600
Okay.

56:29.600 --> 56:31.600
Let's go ahead and begin.

56:31.600 --> 56:32.600
And it's not timed.

56:32.600 --> 56:35.600
You guys can talk it out and then give me your final answer.

56:35.600 --> 56:37.600
We're fighting against each other.

56:37.600 --> 56:38.600
Okay.

56:38.600 --> 56:39.600
First question.

56:39.600 --> 56:42.600
When asked, what is your biggest fear?

56:42.600 --> 56:48.600
Who said, be entrapped underground for reals?

56:48.600 --> 56:49.600
Biggest fear.

56:49.600 --> 56:53.600
Who said, be entrapped underground for reals?

56:53.600 --> 56:55.600
I think, I know.

56:55.600 --> 56:57.600
My guess would be Spencer.

56:57.600 --> 56:59.600
Because it sounds like something Spencer would say also.

56:59.600 --> 57:11.600
Because I truly believe Adam is without fear.

57:11.600 --> 57:15.600
That's not a compliment.

57:15.600 --> 57:20.600
Sociopaths have no fear.

57:20.600 --> 57:23.600
Lighten in strikes again.

57:23.600 --> 57:25.600
I mean, I agree, absolutely.

57:25.600 --> 57:31.600
I know that Spencer uses that colloquial apostrophe instead of a G kind of talking.

57:31.600 --> 57:33.600
The idea that he typed it is very charming.

57:33.600 --> 57:36.600
All right.

57:36.600 --> 57:39.600
Be entrapped underground for reals.

57:39.600 --> 57:41.600
He does have falcony qualities.

57:41.600 --> 57:42.600
You're right.

57:42.600 --> 57:45.600
There's something very graceful about you.

57:45.600 --> 57:46.600
Thank you.

57:46.600 --> 57:47.600
Yeah.

57:47.600 --> 57:49.600
That is a compliment.

57:49.600 --> 57:52.600
The correct answer was actually Adam.

57:52.600 --> 57:59.600
No, you read a how-to guide on how to present as human.

57:59.600 --> 58:03.600
Humans die, right?

58:03.600 --> 58:08.600
I live in my castle forever, but that one won't get them.

58:08.600 --> 58:09.600
All right.

58:09.600 --> 58:15.600
He's a worthier adversary than we had anticipated.

58:15.600 --> 58:16.600
Okay.

58:16.600 --> 58:17.600
Next question.

58:17.600 --> 58:20.600
I can feel my V's and W's sometimes.

58:20.600 --> 58:21.600
Next question.

58:21.600 --> 58:26.600
When asked to describe an embarrassing moment from his childhood, who said,

58:26.600 --> 58:32.600
I called a lady fat, she was fat.

58:32.600 --> 58:35.600
When asked to describe an embarrassing moment from his childhood,

58:35.600 --> 58:38.600
who said I called a lady fat, she was fat.

58:38.600 --> 58:41.600
Again, my guess would be Spencer.

58:41.600 --> 58:42.600
Me too, yeah.

58:42.600 --> 58:45.600
Because Adam clearly does not get embarrassed.

58:45.600 --> 58:47.600
No, she was fat.

58:47.600 --> 58:48.600
No, no.

58:48.600 --> 58:49.600
No, no.

58:49.600 --> 58:50.600
What's going on?

58:50.600 --> 58:51.600
What's your guess?

58:51.600 --> 58:52.600
No, no.

58:52.600 --> 58:53.600
He's fucking.

58:53.600 --> 58:54.600
Am I messing with you?

58:54.600 --> 58:55.600
That is correct.

58:55.600 --> 58:56.600
It was Spencer.

58:56.600 --> 59:01.600
I'm batting 100 so far.

59:01.600 --> 59:03.600
Next question.

59:03.600 --> 59:10.600
When asked, you can eat three things for the rest of your life.

59:10.600 --> 59:11.600
What are they?

59:11.600 --> 59:15.600
Who said potatoes, rice.

59:15.600 --> 59:19.600
And the souls of the unsullied.

59:19.600 --> 59:27.600
Adam Goldberg.

59:27.600 --> 59:28.600
Okay, I'm going to give you.

59:28.600 --> 59:29.600
I'm sorry.

59:29.600 --> 59:30.600
I'm sorry.

59:30.600 --> 59:31.600
Could you read those?

59:31.600 --> 59:32.600
Half bread.

59:32.600 --> 59:33.600
Half bread.

59:33.600 --> 59:36.600
The three things were potatoes, rice, pizza.

59:36.600 --> 59:42.600
Who, for the rest of his life, will only eat potatoes, rice, pizza.

59:42.600 --> 59:49.600
Well, I mean, I'm going to go Spencer again because I know Adam's response to that question

59:49.600 --> 59:51.600
would be more complicated.

59:51.600 --> 59:58.600
I think Adam would say, well, I have a rare form of anemia that requires that I have insulin.

59:58.600 --> 01:00:01.600
He would, I don't know, something that would be circuitous.

01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:04.600
Of all the things you accuse me of, diabetes.

01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:06.600
I didn't mean to.

01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:08.600
It's on the long list, but I did not see diabetes.

01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:13.600
I just assumed your diet is complicated or that even if it wasn't, like that you would,

01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:19.600
yeah, I could see Spencer as being a simple, simple child who just wants to bolt up.

01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:20.600
You know what?

01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:21.600
I feel like.

01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:24.600
First of all, who doesn't?

01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:31.600
But I feel like part of Spencer's appeal is that he can sort of, I really feel like there's

01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:38.600
something about you that is above us, but that's a compliment, but also your ability

01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:42.600
to sort of connect with regular normal humans.

01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:45.600
And this is all a compliment, by the way.

01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:48.600
You once said that you could have a religion, Spencer.

01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:53.600
So I would go with Spencer, too.

01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:54.600
That is correct.

01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:55.600
It was Spencer.

01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:57.600
What would your answer have been, Adam?

01:00:57.600 --> 01:01:03.600
I was considering a real answer about how you can make a lot of cuisine with the same

01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:04.600
three foods.

01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:05.600
Exactly.

01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:07.600
Can you tell us the other answers?

01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:08.600
You can read my joke answer.

01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:11.600
Adam said dwindling rapidly.

01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:13.600
Which fits the context of the question.

01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:16.600
Rewind the podcast and put my answer in the question together.

01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:17.600
It's pretty funny.

01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:21.600
I nailed it.

01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:23.600
Check that out.

01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:24.600
Rewind.

01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:31.600
Sorry that laughed privately.

01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:34.600
Adam has all this overlap with Spencer.

01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:36.600
I would say they're both above.

01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:37.600
Certainly.

01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:45.600
I don't know what the difference is, but Adam's jokes, they rhythmically, they land on the

01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:46.600
downbeat.

01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:52.600
And then everyone's like, you can't dance to it.

01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:58.600
It's like trying to watch Edward Scissorhands shake hands.

01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:00.600
He doesn't have the tools.

01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:05.600
But when you listen to anything that he says, if you listen to that interview that he did

01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:11.600
with the podcast cast and stuff like that, Adam's like, he's no...

01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:17.600
I'm out of sync with this plane of existence.

01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:22.600
Okay, next question.

01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:24.600
Can I ask, why were you counting?

01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:25.600
What was going on?

01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:27.600
I was trying to get to the rhythm.

01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:35.600
I did think it would involve him slowing himself down in some unnatural way.

01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:36.600
Which is unfair.

01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:38.600
It was very appealing for some reason.

01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:39.600
I don't know why.

01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:40.600
I liked it.

01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:41.600
All right.

01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:42.600
Next question.

01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:52.600
How about we got to go into Adam's brain and slide out those 2001...

01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:57.600
I'm sorry, I can't do that, Dan.

01:02:57.600 --> 01:03:00.600
Thanks for doing this, Adam.

01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:02.600
All right.

01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:08.600
Next, I asked both gentlemen, you were just given a yacht.

01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:11.600
What do you name it?

01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:13.600
This was good, Aaron.

01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:15.600
You did good.

01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:17.600
Oh, you know how much I need that.

01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:23.600
Well, you know how much I never give people what they need.

01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:25.600
The more they need it, the more I don't want to give it to them.

01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:29.600
So I really, you know, I really feel you did a good job of this game.

01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:35.600
This game has no winners.

01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:40.600
It's becoming clear that this game just has a loser and it's not anyone who's playing.

01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:42.600
I thought by the start of that sentence.

01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:44.600
No, you're not playing.

01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:46.600
She is talking about you.

01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:48.600
I'm joking.

01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:50.600
No.

01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:52.600
They give you a TV show.

01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:54.600
That's touching my heart.

01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:56.600
That accent was on the downbeat.

01:03:56.600 --> 01:03:58.600
No, Adam's answers are great.

01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:00.600
I'm not...

01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:02.600
Great, Adam's a very smart man.

01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:06.600
Who said when asked what he would name his yacht?

01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:08.600
I love this.

01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:10.600
Carl Rove.

01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:16.600
When asked what he would name his yacht,

01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:20.600
who said Carl Rove?

01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:28.600
I think that Spencer knows who Carl Rove is, but I don't think he cares.

01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:36.600
I think Adam maybe would be the one to try to make some point with naming his yacht.

01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:38.600
Ditto.

01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:44.600
I feel like we're thinking exactly the same on all of these.

01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:46.600
Can you tell us what the other answer was?

01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:48.600
I can't do that.

01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:54.600
The other answer was the USS Hubris.

01:04:54.600 --> 01:05:00.600
The USS Hubris.

01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:04.600
I mean, that's what I'd named mine, by the way.

01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:12.600
So whoever said that should really be proud of themselves.

01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:16.600
I'm guessing you're Hubris and he's Rove.

01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:18.600
Correct.

01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:20.600
Adam.

01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:24.600
So what were the final...

01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:26.600
We both thought that Carl Rove would be Adam.

01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:28.600
That was Carl Rove was Spencer.

01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:30.600
Wow.

01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:32.600
It's like the same title.

01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:34.600
As USS Hubris.

01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:36.600
Oh, it's just like a rich guy's name.

01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:38.600
Yeah, yeah.

01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:42.600
It's like a symbol of power and excess over others.

01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:44.600
Which is what a yacht is.

01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:46.600
Yeah, that's what I mean.

01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:48.600
It's like, hey, you should come out to Carl Rove.

01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:50.600
It's funny.

01:05:50.600 --> 01:05:54.600
Let's go get drunk on Carl Rove.

01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:58.600
Yeah, it's peace chained on the third dock or whatever.

01:05:58.600 --> 01:06:00.600
I don't have Carl Rove.

01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:02.600
Next question.

01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:06.600
We're going to take Carl Rove out and do some E.

01:06:06.600 --> 01:06:08.600
Con Kanye's coming.

01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:10.600
It's a great name.

01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:12.600
It's a great name.

01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:16.600
Yeah, New Year's Eve. Let's go inside Carl Rove and...

01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:18.600
Alright, next question.

01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:20.600
Fuck.

01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:22.600
Let him finish.

01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:24.600
Fuck.

01:06:24.600 --> 01:06:26.600
Alright, continue.

01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:28.600
I asked both gentlemen,

01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:32.600
if you could date any celebrity, who would it be and why?

01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:35.600
Who said Jake Gyllenhaal?

01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:37.600
It would prove a theory of mine.

01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:44.600
Who said Jake Gyllenhaal?

01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:47.600
It would prove a theory of mine.

01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:53.600
I mean, that's gotta be Adam.

01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:55.600
Yeah, for sure.

01:06:55.600 --> 01:06:58.600
And again, it's really funny.

01:06:58.600 --> 01:06:59.600
It's very funny.

01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:01.600
But it's funny because she read it.

01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:03.600
No, well...

01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:04.600
I was reading the answer.

01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:06.600
No, I know. I'm saying it's great.

01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:08.600
But it's funny in print.

01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:09.600
Yeah, it's great.

01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:11.600
You are correct. That was Adam.

01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:13.600
Adam over there.

01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:16.600
Adam, what is your theory?

01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:18.600
Jake Gyllenhaal is gay.

01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:23.600
I like that in your head,

01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:26.600
just him being gay is enough

01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:28.600
for him to want to have sex with you.

01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:32.600
Well, no.

01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:34.600
You gotta get tired of people at some point.

01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:36.600
The question is, if you could...

01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:38.600
What was it, date or marry, right?

01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:41.600
Well, in either case, the question grants the

01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:43.600
answerer god power.

01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:45.600
So, I think the funny thing is

01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:47.600
that he would waste that power.

01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:50.600
To be right about one thing about a celebrity.

01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:53.600
There were more questions about dating.

01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:56.600
I mean, Aaron made the quiz, and it's very emotional.

01:07:56.600 --> 01:07:58.600
It just makes you romantic and emotional,

01:07:58.600 --> 01:08:00.600
and me slurring those words.

01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:02.600
That is true.

01:08:02.600 --> 01:08:05.600
He doesn't want to use the power to have sex

01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:07.600
with someone he wants to have sex with.

01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:09.600
He wants to prove he's gay.

01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:11.600
Gotcha.

01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:14.600
He was a college friend, Steve, and go,

01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:17.600
told ya.

01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:19.600
I would love it so much if this actually happened

01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:21.600
in real life.

01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:23.600
It would be the greatest day of my life,

01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:24.600
of your life.

01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:25.600
And Jake's life.

01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:27.600
And Jake's life.

01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:30.600
The best pilot in the world, single-camera pilot,

01:08:30.600 --> 01:08:32.600
would be Adam Goldberg, doing a reboot

01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:34.600
of The Greatest American Hero,

01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:37.600
where Adam Goldberg gets the super suit.

01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:39.600
He's just a superhero, but he doesn't know.

01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:41.600
He just has these powers, and they're just

01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:44.600
watching how he would use them.

01:08:44.600 --> 01:08:46.600
I'll see.

01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:48.600
It would be kind of awesome that he rescued you,

01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:50.600
but then also like...

01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:52.600
Yeah, sorry.

01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:54.600
No, that was the suit.

01:08:54.600 --> 01:08:56.600
You're feeling the suit.

01:08:56.600 --> 01:08:57.600
That's the suit.

01:08:57.600 --> 01:09:00.600
I asked both Adam and Spencer

01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:03.600
if you could be any animal in the world

01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:06.600
for 24 hours.

01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:08.600
24?

01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:12.600
Which animal would you be

01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:14.600
and why?

01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:17.600
Who said some sort of a cool bird

01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:20.600
or jungle cat?

01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:23.600
Who said some sort of a cool bird

01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:25.600
or jungle cat?

01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:26.600
Those are like...

01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:29.600
That's a wide response.

01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:31.600
Can I ask real quick

01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:33.600
who Spencer wanted to have sex with?

01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:35.600
What was his response?

01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:36.600
I want to know too.

01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:38.600
Well, he passed.

01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:40.600
Why?

01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:42.600
Because I just looked at this e-mail

01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:44.600
and just shout out a bunch of answers.

01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:46.600
He also sent me an e-mail saying

01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:48.600
if this is some sort of secret dating thing,

01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:50.600
I'm not into it.

01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:52.600
I'm on to you.

01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:54.600
You didn't tell him why

01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:56.600
and you were asking him this question.

01:09:56.600 --> 01:09:58.600
I said I'm comfortable and can you answer these questions?

01:09:58.600 --> 01:10:00.600
Yeah, I thought that was a cover.

01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:02.600
Like I was going to scour the audience

01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:04.600
like, this look good to you?

01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:06.600
You'd never do anything like that.

01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:08.600
Anyone who listens to your podcast knows

01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:10.600
you'd never play a matchmaker or anything.

01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:12.600
That'd be weird.

01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:14.600
I would say Jungle Cat or Bird.

01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:16.600
I would say it's Spencer

01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:18.600
because first I said

01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:20.600
you have falcony qualities about you

01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:23.600
and also jungle cat qualities about you.

01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:25.600
And also while we were all doing

01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:27.600
like the Spencer voice,

01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:29.600
he in the Spencer voice said

01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:31.600
jungle cat or bird.

01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:34.600
He knows it's Spencer

01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:36.600
and I think, wow.

01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:38.600
Unfortunately, I agree too

01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:40.600
as I have every time with Camilla.

01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:42.600
You're correct. That was Spencer.

01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:44.600
Adam said, does the animal die?

01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:46.600
I could fit a bird day into my schedule.

01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:48.600
Oh.

01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:51.600
I thought Spencer's answer would be a human being.

01:10:55.600 --> 01:10:57.600
Or something like how many hit dice does it have?

01:10:57.600 --> 01:10:59.600
Yeah.

01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:01.600
I know how many hit dice it has.

01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:09.600
And I know how much damage my katana does.

01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:11.600
Any ladies in the audience

01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:14.600
get aroused when they heard the dice line?

01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:19.600
Yup.

01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:21.600
Resounding yup.

01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:24.600
Back to Minneapolis.

01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:26.600
Don't you worry Spencer, I'll get you married.

01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:29.600
I said I'd have none of this.

01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:33.600
Spencer, you could parlay your notoriety

01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:35.600
into so much...

01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:38.600
Specifically you and no one else

01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:40.600
might think that.

01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:42.600
No. You have no idea.

01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:44.600
You have like a...

01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:46.600
Oh my God, so many of them.

01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:48.600
But he'd have to not be himself.

01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:50.600
I know. That's what's great.

01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:52.600
He'd have to go from being a Spencer

01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:54.600
that was adored by people

01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:57.600
to he'd have to cross that all-important line

01:11:57.600 --> 01:11:59.600
to being a guy that...

01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:01.600
What kind of creep does this?

01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:03.600
And the answer is many.

01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:06.600
Oh, so you enjoy watching me do that thing?

01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:08.600
Well...

01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:10.600
Any way to get some pussy out of this?

01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:12.600
It's a hard line

01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:14.600
for a gentleman to cross.

01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:16.600
But it's also, here's the thing,

01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:19.600
it's not just she's getting something out of it too.

01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:21.600
She's getting to have sex with Spencer.

01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:23.600
It goes both ways.

01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:25.600
I'm taking advantage of them.

01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:27.600
But the same thing that's making him adorable

01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:29.600
makes it hard to talk to...

01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:31.600
People are adoring the fact that

01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:33.600
finally on display is a personality

01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:35.600
that's very resonant,

01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:37.600
which is someone who doesn't normally...

01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:39.600
You know, doesn't do that fucking tango

01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:41.600
in a one-on-one interaction.

01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:43.600
My theory is that Spencer is secretly dating

01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:45.600
someone famous like Paul Abdul.

01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:48.600
I'd like to live

01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:51.600
in how coomail perceives me.

01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:53.600
You call it men?

01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:55.600
I'd shoot lasers and

01:12:55.600 --> 01:12:57.600
ship kittens.

01:12:57.600 --> 01:12:59.600
And they'd still be enjoyable.

01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:01.600
I'd say I'd get it,

01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:03.600
because I watch the documentary footage,

01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:05.600
so I've seen footage

01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:07.600
of you interacting with women

01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:09.600
after shows on tour.

01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:11.600
Did you see them introducing me to their boyfriends?

01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:13.600
Uh...

01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:15.600
No, no.

01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:17.600
That's good editing.

01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:19.600
I've seen a handful of cute girls

01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:21.600
get you to sign stuff

01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:23.600
and be just as nervous as you are,

01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:25.600
and like kind of lingering

01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:27.600
and hanging out.

01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:29.600
The fratty part of

01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:31.600
my brain, you know, wants to go like

01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:33.600
oh, hit on her!

01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:35.600
But it's like...

01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:37.600
Then you wouldn't be Spencer.

01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:39.600
And she also is like, you're not...

01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:41.600
Yeah, I don't know.

01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:43.600
I have a weird love-hate relationship

01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:45.600
with this idea.

01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:47.600
You know...

01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:49.600
That's the puss.

01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:51.600
I, for one, am totally

01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:53.600
over it.

01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:55.600
You're over what?

01:13:55.600 --> 01:13:57.600
I'm over the matchmaking for Spencer,

01:13:57.600 --> 01:13:59.600
because he's punished me even when I'm not asking for it.

01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:01.600
It's a big inner friendship.

01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:03.600
Why don't you try and...

01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:05.600
help Adam?

01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:07.600
I could fit a bird day into my schedule.

01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:13.600
That was great.

01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:15.600
I also don't think it's like

01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:17.600
I don't think Spencer necessarily

01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:19.600
needs a girlfriend.

01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:21.600
I think if someone's autonomous and happy,

01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:23.600
they don't need to be with anybody.

01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:25.600
Everybody likes to have sex.

01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:27.600
Well, I think that Spencer has sex.

01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:29.600
You're right.

01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:31.600
I think the Spencer-ness of him

01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:33.600
would not be there.

01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:35.600
He's right next to you.

01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:37.600
I'm barely autonomous or happy.

01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:41.600
Only a few more questions,

01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:43.600
if not one or two.

01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:45.600
We're having a good time up here.

01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:47.600
That's the four of us.

01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:49.600
I'm having a good time.

01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:51.600
If there were a holiday in your honor,

01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:53.600
what would it celebrate?

01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:55.600
Who said

01:14:55.600 --> 01:14:57.600
courage?

01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:07.600
If there were a holiday in your honor,

01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:09.600
what would it celebrate?

01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:13.600
Who said courage?

01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:17.600
Also the name of my firstborn.

01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:21.600
I'll just go Adam,

01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:23.600
because...

01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:25.600
I think he...

01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:27.600
You see yourself as very brave, I think.

01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:29.600
Not that you're not.

01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:31.600
You said he doesn't have fear.

01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:33.600
You were without fear, yeah.

01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:35.600
Look when he tolerates up here.

01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:37.600
Yeah, I know, it's great.

01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:39.600
In fact, said my birth.

01:15:39.600 --> 01:15:41.600
It was Spencer who said courage.

01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:45.600
Can I explain my answer?

01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:47.600
At some point I was like,

01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:49.600
I should answer things that people might think

01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:51.600
Adam would say.

01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:55.600
Wish I said courage.

01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:01.600
When I wrote my birth, I was trying to write

01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:03.600
an answer Spencer might say.

01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:05.600
I was going to write myself.

01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:07.600
And then I changed it to courage.

01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:09.600
This is amazing.

01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:11.600
You guys are trying to be each other,

01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:13.600
and very accurate at it.

01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:15.600
You should have read the whole questionnaire.

01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:17.600
When asked what punctuation mark

01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:19.600
best describes your personality,

01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:21.600
who said an ellipsis,

01:16:21.600 --> 01:16:23.600
and who said an enterobang?

01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:25.600
When asked

01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:27.600
what punctuation mark

01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:29.600
best describes your personality?

01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:31.600
Enterobang.

01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:33.600
I heard all that, I just don't want an enterobang.

01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:35.600
It's an exclamation mark.

01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:37.600
How is this happening?

01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:43.600
It's alternating question marks

01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:45.600
and exclamation marks.

01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:47.600
Can it be one pairing of them?

01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:49.600
Is that still an enterobang?

01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:51.600
Yeah, you see it a lot on

01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:53.600
line writing.

01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:55.600
It's not like a proper...

01:16:55.600 --> 01:16:57.600
But it's not like Beatle Bailey swearing.

01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:01.600
That is called growlix.

01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:03.600
Those weird like symbols,

01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:05.600
those are called growlix.

01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:07.600
Do you listen to Wait, Wait, Don't Tell Me?

01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:09.600
That's like an answer on that.

01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:11.600
Growlixes?

01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:13.600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:15.600
You can check out Wait, Wait, Don't Tell Me on...

01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:17.600
Tuesday nights at 9.

01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:19.600
Who said ellipsis,

01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:21.600
and who said enterobang?

01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:23.600
Well, now the jig is up.

01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:25.600
We got one guy doing an impression of the other guy.

01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:27.600
I don't know.

01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:29.600
I don't know if that's true.

01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:31.600
Just...

01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:33.600
I'll say that

01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:35.600
Spencer did the enterobang.

01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:37.600
No, no, no.

01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:39.600
I mean, if he was going to answer honestly,

01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:41.600
I guess he'd be an ellipsis.

01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:43.600
Spencer.

01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:45.600
Spencer would be an ellipsis.

01:17:45.600 --> 01:17:47.600
It's thoughtful and reserved.

01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:49.600
Timing is king for Spencer.

01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:51.600
It's very, very restrained.

01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:53.600
Yeah.

01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:55.600
Adam, as we know, is just...

01:17:55.600 --> 01:17:57.600
Everyone's reaction to him is an enterobang.

01:17:57.600 --> 01:17:59.600
He's up on stage again.

01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:01.600
Huh?

01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:03.600
He's like Marmaduke.

01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:05.600
Can I say something?

01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:07.600
A large success movie?

01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:09.600
That was great.

01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:11.600
I made a Marmaduke movie.

01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:13.600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:15.600
You know what? I'm sorry, this is not going to plan the podcast

01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:17.600
or even the people here, but the fact that your toenails

01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:19.600
exactly match that guy's shoe color

01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:21.600
is I cannot...

01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:23.600
I'm like staring...

01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:25.600
at your toes.

01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:27.600
Do you guys know each other? Do you guys know each other?

01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:29.600
Isn't that crazy? Because it's not a standard color.

01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:31.600
Is that cyan?

01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:33.600
Is that cyan?

01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:35.600
It's like a fuchsia... what is it?

01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:37.600
Turquoise.

01:18:37.600 --> 01:18:39.600
That's right.

01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:41.600
I describe stuff for a living.

01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:43.600
I mean, I don't make a living out of it.

01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:45.600
Speaking of which...

01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:47.600
All right, so I'll say enterobang is...

01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:49.600
You said he's ellipsis.

01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:51.600
Yeah.

01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:53.600
That's the accurate, and I'll say the same thing.

01:18:53.600 --> 01:18:55.600
They're trying to be each other.

01:18:55.600 --> 01:18:57.600
Well, you're right.

01:18:57.600 --> 01:18:59.600
Spencer was ellipsis, and Adam was enterobang.

01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:01.600
Final question.

01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:03.600
We're tied, I'm assuming.

01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:05.600
You are.

01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:07.600
We'll go separate ways.

01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:09.600
You've got to split.

01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:11.600
I'm going to double this question.

01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:13.600
You'll see what I mean in a second.

01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:15.600
And then you'll have a better suggestion

01:19:15.600 --> 01:19:17.600
for how to word what I just said.

01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:21.600
It'll be like his...

01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:23.600
You'll have to rewind to hear the joke from his...

01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:25.600
Remember the question? Go ahead.

01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:27.600
I do.

01:19:27.600 --> 01:19:29.600
I'm distracted by this.

01:19:33.600 --> 01:19:35.600
All right, well, this...

01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:37.600
You each are going to get

01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:39.600
two private personal questions.

01:19:39.600 --> 01:19:41.600
What are they?

01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:45.600
No, you don't get to give her a question.

01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:47.600
I thought that her question was going to be

01:19:47.600 --> 01:19:49.600
what are the questions, and then your answers

01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:51.600
are going to be questions.

01:19:51.600 --> 01:19:53.600
Enterobang?

01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:55.600
We're going to actually...

01:19:55.600 --> 01:19:57.600
I'm sorry, I take that.

01:19:57.600 --> 01:19:59.600
We're going to do a lightning round

01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:01.600
of four questions.

01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:03.600
And you will just individually say

01:20:03.600 --> 01:20:05.600
Spencer or Adam.

01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:07.600
So you'll give him one that will be directed to me

01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:09.600
and then to him and then to him.

01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:11.600
Okay, all right.

01:20:11.600 --> 01:20:13.600
First question, Camille.

01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:15.600
Who said when asked if a movie is made of your life

01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:17.600
and you could choose the actor

01:20:17.600 --> 01:20:19.600
and why?

01:20:19.600 --> 01:20:21.600
Who said Family Ties era Michael J. Fox?

01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:23.600
I will say that's Adam.

01:20:23.600 --> 01:20:25.600
That is correct.

01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:27.600
Maybe really surprising that Spencer said that.

01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:29.600
I saw you smirking.

01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:31.600
That's a good answer.

01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:37.600
Dan, when asked if you were a spy,

01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:39.600
what would your alias be?

01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:41.600
Who said Jimmy Bluffet?

01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:45.600
Who said Jimmy Bluffet?

01:20:45.600 --> 01:20:47.600
Spencer.

01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:49.600
That is incorrect.

01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:51.600
I knew he was slapping his knee

01:20:51.600 --> 01:20:53.600
at how hilarious Jimmy Bluffet was.

01:20:55.600 --> 01:20:57.600
That feels like tickling to me.

01:20:57.600 --> 01:20:59.600
I always laugh even though it's no good.

01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:01.600
Camille, when asked

01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:03.600
what was your nickname growing up,

01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:05.600
who said Lumpy?

01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:07.600
Who said Lumpy?

01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:09.600
Come on.

01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:11.600
Lumpy?

01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:13.600
Who said Lumpy?

01:21:13.600 --> 01:21:15.600
Who's nickname was Lumpy?

01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:17.600
When asked, what was your nickname growing up?

01:21:17.600 --> 01:21:19.600
I know, what the fuck?

01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:21.600
This is not...

01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:23.600
Oh, God.

01:21:25.600 --> 01:21:27.600
Spencer.

01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:29.600
That is correct.

01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:31.600
Wait, I'm not the asshole.

01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:35.600
It's an Ed Ed Nettie reference.

01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:37.600
Remember what?

01:21:37.600 --> 01:21:39.600
It's an Ed Ed Nettie.

01:21:39.600 --> 01:21:41.600
Dan.

01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:43.600
Mine was Cumpail.

01:21:49.600 --> 01:21:51.600
Jesus Christ.

01:21:53.600 --> 01:21:55.600
Holy shit.

01:21:55.600 --> 01:21:57.600
I don't think I've ever...

01:21:59.600 --> 01:22:01.600
Cumpail.

01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:07.600
One genius kid.

01:22:07.600 --> 01:22:09.600
Yeah, I'm sure that guy designs for Apple now.

01:22:09.600 --> 01:22:11.600
Yeah, that guy's a genius.

01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:13.600
We get him on the cancer thing.

01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:15.600
We'll figure it out.

01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:17.600
Instead, he's just coming up with amazing

01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:19.600
hurtful nicknames.

01:22:19.600 --> 01:22:21.600
I tried to spin it too.

01:22:21.600 --> 01:22:23.600
I was like, oh, that means when I come,

01:22:23.600 --> 01:22:25.600
I fill up a pail.

01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:27.600
So that's good.

01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:29.600
And they'd be like,

01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:31.600
no, it means you are a pail of Cump.

01:22:31.600 --> 01:22:33.600
All right.

01:22:37.600 --> 01:22:39.600
I think it means you turned everyone on.

01:22:41.600 --> 01:22:43.600
I tried to, I tried to spin it that way.

01:22:45.600 --> 01:22:47.600
Oh, boy.

01:22:47.600 --> 01:22:49.600
All right, Dan.

01:22:49.600 --> 01:22:51.600
Final question.

01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:53.600
When asked, how do you feel about Dan?

01:22:55.600 --> 01:22:57.600
Who said

01:22:57.600 --> 01:22:59.600
Dan Harmon is a genius

01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:01.600
and I will die defending his vision?

01:23:01.600 --> 01:23:03.600
Protecting.

01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:05.600
Unless Mitch Hurwitz calls.

01:23:05.600 --> 01:23:07.600
Who said Dan Harmon is a genius

01:23:07.600 --> 01:23:09.600
and I will die defending his vision

01:23:09.600 --> 01:23:11.600
unless Mitch Hurwitz calls?

01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:13.600
I mean, that was Adam

01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:15.600
or Spencer imitating Adam.

01:23:15.600 --> 01:23:17.600
The other person said,

01:23:17.600 --> 01:23:19.600
really?

01:23:19.600 --> 01:23:21.600
Oh, okay.

01:23:21.600 --> 01:23:23.600
Yeah, Adam, that was Adam.

01:23:23.600 --> 01:23:25.600
You are correct.

01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:27.600
The winner of the game is Cumae.

01:23:29.600 --> 01:23:31.600
Thank you, Adam.

01:23:31.600 --> 01:23:33.600
Thank you for participating in this game.

01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:37.600
Adam may need to stay

01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:39.600
because we have to play the new dragons

01:23:39.600 --> 01:23:41.600
and we need a bull red.

01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:43.600
I played twice.

01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:45.600
I had a really good time.

01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:47.600
Congratulations, Cumpale. That was wonderful.

01:23:47.600 --> 01:23:49.600
You started this

01:23:49.600 --> 01:23:51.600
with five consecutive insults

01:23:51.600 --> 01:23:53.600
that were really funny

01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:55.600
I thought even the hurtful ones

01:23:55.600 --> 01:23:57.600
were funny.

01:23:57.600 --> 01:23:59.600
Okay, 12 consecutive funny insults.

01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:01.600
Yep, thank you.

01:24:01.600 --> 01:24:03.600
So I won a game.

01:24:03.600 --> 01:24:05.600
Alright, let's play some Dungeons & Dragons.

01:24:05.600 --> 01:24:07.600
Yeah, let's make a lightning round.

01:24:07.600 --> 01:24:09.600
Oh, wow, you have the music and everything.

01:24:09.600 --> 01:24:11.600
I didn't expect that.

01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:13.600
Oh, you're not ready?

01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:15.600
Well, I mean...

01:24:15.600 --> 01:24:17.600
Should we talk about race for a second?

01:24:17.600 --> 01:24:19.600
I got it. I got it.

01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:21.600
I want to say I'm just making fun of you

01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:23.600
because it's fun.

01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:25.600
I don't mean to be hurtful.

01:24:25.600 --> 01:24:27.600
The last couple weeks

01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:29.600
and I always bring this up myself

01:24:29.600 --> 01:24:31.600
but I have these moments when I'm sitting around

01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:33.600
and sometimes I'm actually crying

01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:35.600
when I'm saying to the air and I'm like,

01:24:35.600 --> 01:24:37.600
I just want people to like me

01:24:37.600 --> 01:24:39.600
and it just fucking hurts.

01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:41.600
I fucked up again.

01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:43.600
I did it again. I said some shit

01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:45.600
and then we were reading in variety headlines

01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:47.600
and it's like everyone hates me.

01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:49.600
I think of Adam Goldberg.

01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:51.600
How does he do it?

01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:53.600
There's no point where Adam has ever gone

01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:55.600
like, you know what, fuck this.

01:24:55.600 --> 01:24:57.600
Fuck this and storm down.

01:24:57.600 --> 01:24:59.600
It's like a roast. It's from a place of...

01:24:59.600 --> 01:25:01.600
Uh...

01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:03.600
You know.

01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:05.600
Don't make me finish it.

01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:07.600
It's from a place of institutionalized

01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:09.600
racism and...

01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:11.600
Yeah.

01:25:11.600 --> 01:25:13.600
I am fine with it coming from on the stage.

01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:15.600
For all the people on theharmontown.com form

01:25:15.600 --> 01:25:17.600
and Reddit,

01:25:17.600 --> 01:25:19.600
backslashharmontown.

01:25:19.600 --> 01:25:21.600
Who just like me.

01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:23.600
I'd like to take this opportunity to tell you

01:25:23.600 --> 01:25:25.600
have a great life.

01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:27.600
Stay away from fires.

01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:29.600
Stay away from bands that are near fires.

01:25:29.600 --> 01:25:31.600
I'm having a great out here.

01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:33.600
I'm loving it. I'm loving life.

01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:35.600
Alright.

01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:45.600
When we last met,

01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:47.600
Rose had just finished mastering

01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:49.600
the basics of their seasonal armlets.

01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:51.600
And after discussing their

01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:53.600
new abilities, the gang decided

01:25:53.600 --> 01:25:55.600
to free Sharpie's father from the demon

01:25:55.600 --> 01:25:57.600
occupied yellow camp.

01:25:57.600 --> 01:25:59.600
Chris de Burgh became invisible

01:25:59.600 --> 01:26:01.600
and then attacked one of the demonic

01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:03.600
taskmasters and Mulraine put a sack

01:26:03.600 --> 01:26:05.600
on top of a bedroll.

01:26:07.600 --> 01:26:09.600
And then nothing else

01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:11.600
happened.

01:26:11.600 --> 01:26:13.600
I stacked dice for a little while

01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:15.600
and didn't really pay attention

01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:17.600
to the topics.

01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:19.600
That's all.

01:26:19.600 --> 01:26:21.600
Alright.

01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:23.600
Spencer everyone.

01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:25.600
You can't even make people clap

01:26:25.600 --> 01:26:27.600
for Spencer.

01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:29.600
Spencer can't even make people clap.

01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:31.600
He can't.

01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:33.600
Does nobody said Spencer everyone?

01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:35.600
I was wondering what he said.

01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:37.600
Everyone was like, we love Spencer

01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:39.600
but Adam says it.

01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:41.600
Something as basic as

01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:43.600
Deborah Kadevra.

01:26:43.600 --> 01:26:45.600
The rabbit

01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:47.600
falls out the bottom of the hat

01:26:47.600 --> 01:26:49.600
and dies.

01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:51.600
Yeah, but where did the hat come from?

01:26:55.600 --> 01:26:57.600
Ladies and gentlemen, put your hands together

01:26:57.600 --> 01:26:59.600
for a hundred...

01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:01.600
Everyone was like, I don't know what to do.

01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:03.600
We love Spencer.

01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:05.600
My hands are tied

01:27:05.600 --> 01:27:07.600
from applauding.

01:27:07.600 --> 01:27:09.600
I made the executive decision

01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:11.600
to have...

01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:13.600
Because you're controlling, you're playing Quark.

01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:15.600
You're playing Jeff Davis' character, Aaron.

01:27:15.600 --> 01:27:17.600
And then...

01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:19.600
Adam is playing Mulraine.

01:27:19.600 --> 01:27:21.600
Alright.

01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:23.600
I don't know, it just made sense to me.

01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:25.600
Alright.

01:27:25.600 --> 01:27:27.600
So last week, Kumail, my dad was playing

01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:29.600
your character and he used your ability

01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:31.600
to turn invisible and stab the crap out

01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:33.600
of a demon.

01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:35.600
You have a dad?

01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:37.600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:39.600
That is amazing.

01:27:39.600 --> 01:27:41.600
In my head, there was

01:27:41.600 --> 01:27:43.600
like a truck driving of melons

01:27:43.600 --> 01:27:45.600
and it fell off and then you came out of it.

01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:47.600
That's what I tell people, yeah.

01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:49.600
In that Terminator pose?

01:27:49.600 --> 01:27:51.600
Yeah. Like fully formed.

01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:53.600
You just stood up naked and

01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:55.600
then went into the nearest like LL Bean

01:27:55.600 --> 01:27:57.600
and grabbed the vinyl jacket.

01:27:57.600 --> 01:27:59.600
And then went to an Apple store.

01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:01.600
Yeah, I have a dad.

01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:03.600
I need your boots,

01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:05.600
your jacket, and your iPad.

01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:07.600
Yeah.

01:28:07.600 --> 01:28:09.600
Yep.

01:28:09.600 --> 01:28:11.600
Anyone want to do stuff?

01:28:11.600 --> 01:28:13.600
Do you need more explanations?

01:28:13.600 --> 01:28:15.600
Are we fighting? I'm sorry.

01:28:15.600 --> 01:28:17.600
We're still fighting.

01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:19.600
Yeah, when we last met,

01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:21.600
you stabbed a demon.

01:28:21.600 --> 01:28:23.600
That kicked off the fighting

01:28:23.600 --> 01:28:25.600
and then people kind of...

01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:27.600
You talked about stuff right, Aaron,

01:28:27.600 --> 01:28:29.600
and Jeff came to an understanding.

01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:31.600
Right?

01:28:31.600 --> 01:28:33.600
I don't know, I was stacking dice.

01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:35.600
Sure, we came to an understanding.

01:28:35.600 --> 01:28:37.600
Come on, let's play the shit out of D&D.

01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:39.600
Let's just start attacking everything.

01:28:39.600 --> 01:28:41.600
Let's just start out...

01:28:41.600 --> 01:28:43.600
Two males turn last.

01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:45.600
Alright, I'll become...

01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:47.600
Oh, okay.

01:28:49.600 --> 01:28:51.600
Casting offensive spells at everything.

01:28:53.600 --> 01:28:55.600
Ray Scorching Ray is coming up.

01:28:55.600 --> 01:28:57.600
I apologize for his offensive spells.

01:28:57.600 --> 01:28:59.600
He didn't mean them.

01:28:59.600 --> 01:29:01.600
Scorching Ray, I'm the nearest enemy.

01:29:03.600 --> 01:29:05.600
Make him happy this week.

01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:07.600
I'm having a great time.

01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:09.600
I'm having a great time.

01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:13.600
Forgive us for not knowing

01:29:13.600 --> 01:29:15.600
when that's the case.

01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:17.600
I'm really hard to read.

01:29:17.600 --> 01:29:19.600
I'm upset.

01:29:19.600 --> 01:29:21.600
Anyway.

01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:23.600
That happened.

01:29:23.600 --> 01:29:25.600
Oh, yeah, yeah.

01:29:25.600 --> 01:29:27.600
Casting your arms in a magical manner.

01:29:27.600 --> 01:29:29.600
You lose 4th several bolts of fiery bolts.

01:29:33.600 --> 01:29:35.600
Dealing 17 damage to the lead demon.

01:29:35.600 --> 01:29:37.600
Nice.

01:29:37.600 --> 01:29:39.600
Nice.

01:29:39.600 --> 01:29:41.600
That's how you do it.

01:29:41.600 --> 01:29:43.600
The demon twists around

01:29:43.600 --> 01:29:45.600
and surveying Chris de Burghh,

01:29:45.600 --> 01:29:47.600
who just stabbed him in the back.

01:29:47.600 --> 01:29:49.600
He flips about and smacks you

01:29:49.600 --> 01:29:51.600
with his whip,

01:29:51.600 --> 01:29:53.600
and at the end of it,

01:29:53.600 --> 01:29:55.600
just kind of the handle of his whip.

01:29:55.600 --> 01:29:57.600
Kind of like a pistol whip.

01:29:57.600 --> 01:29:59.600
Like a whip whip.

01:29:59.600 --> 01:30:01.600
Yeah.

01:30:01.600 --> 01:30:03.600
Like a whip whip.

01:30:03.600 --> 01:30:05.600
And he hits.

01:30:05.600 --> 01:30:07.600
Dealing 3 damage.

01:30:07.600 --> 01:30:09.600
It happens.

01:30:09.600 --> 01:30:11.600
That sounds about right.

01:30:11.600 --> 01:30:13.600
Putting it at Mulraine.

01:30:13.600 --> 01:30:15.600
No, Quark's turn.

01:30:15.600 --> 01:30:17.600
Mulraine, may we have a moment?

01:30:17.600 --> 01:30:19.600
Absolutely, Quark.

01:30:19.600 --> 01:30:21.600
The rule of three is expired.

01:30:21.600 --> 01:30:23.600
You're now just kicking the corpse.

01:30:23.600 --> 01:30:25.600
My expectation is Adam Goldberg.

01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:27.600
Alright, alright, I get it.

01:30:27.600 --> 01:30:29.600
Hey, how about Lady...

01:30:29.600 --> 01:30:31.600
Hey, have you said Lady and Red yet?

01:30:31.600 --> 01:30:33.600
No, I haven't said it yet.

01:30:33.600 --> 01:30:35.600
Okay, you got 14 more.

01:30:35.600 --> 01:30:37.600
See, being mean back doesn't work.

01:30:37.600 --> 01:30:39.600
Oh, that rabbit...

01:30:39.600 --> 01:30:41.600
I don't think they understood that you were trying to be mean.

01:30:41.600 --> 01:30:43.600
I thought that was part of the issue.

01:30:43.600 --> 01:30:45.600
Fair enough.

01:30:45.600 --> 01:30:47.600
Mulraine.

01:30:47.600 --> 01:30:49.600
This is hard for me to say,

01:30:49.600 --> 01:30:51.600
but I'd like to have a moment.

01:30:51.600 --> 01:30:53.600
I heard it the first time.

01:30:53.600 --> 01:30:55.600
You're so clever.

01:30:55.600 --> 01:30:57.600
Don't get shitty to her.

01:30:57.600 --> 01:30:59.600
Just be shitty to me.

01:30:59.600 --> 01:31:01.600
I'm being shitty to his character.

01:31:01.600 --> 01:31:03.600
Welcome to the show, Hollywood Reporter.

01:31:03.600 --> 01:31:05.600
I hope you all die in a fire.

01:31:09.600 --> 01:31:11.600
Mulraine, I've written you this letter

01:31:11.600 --> 01:31:13.600
on this water skin.

01:31:13.600 --> 01:31:15.600
It explains how

01:31:15.600 --> 01:31:17.600
I've been in awe of you

01:31:17.600 --> 01:31:19.600
our entire adventure.

01:31:19.600 --> 01:31:21.600
And it also explains

01:31:21.600 --> 01:31:23.600
this deep connection

01:31:23.600 --> 01:31:25.600
that I believe we have, and I want us to

01:31:25.600 --> 01:31:27.600
form an alliance

01:31:27.600 --> 01:31:29.600
if that's possible.

01:31:29.600 --> 01:31:31.600
If you'll have me.

01:31:31.600 --> 01:31:33.600
Mulraine considers this.

01:31:33.600 --> 01:31:35.600
Mulraine remembers coming back

01:31:35.600 --> 01:31:37.600
to the woods several planes ago

01:31:37.600 --> 01:31:39.600
and finding you

01:31:39.600 --> 01:31:41.600
hip deep inside her most

01:31:41.600 --> 01:31:43.600
beloved friend, Coco.

01:31:43.600 --> 01:31:45.600
And then says,

01:31:45.600 --> 01:31:47.600
Why not, buddy?

01:31:47.600 --> 01:31:49.600
I'm only good at one thing.

01:31:49.600 --> 01:31:51.600
No, that's it. You can't.

01:31:51.600 --> 01:31:53.600
You can't counter my internal monologue.

01:31:53.600 --> 01:31:55.600
Mulraine has a grin on her face and says,

01:31:55.600 --> 01:31:57.600
You're my best friend ever.

01:31:57.600 --> 01:31:59.600
No.

01:31:59.600 --> 01:32:01.600
Adventure.

01:32:01.600 --> 01:32:03.600
Adventure.

01:32:05.600 --> 01:32:07.600
They say you're doing my face.

01:32:07.600 --> 01:32:09.600
No, I was doing what the character

01:32:09.600 --> 01:32:11.600
of my face is.

01:32:11.600 --> 01:32:13.600
Alright, alright. Well, I give you this water skin.

01:32:13.600 --> 01:32:15.600
And then

01:32:15.600 --> 01:32:17.600
I see that

01:32:17.600 --> 01:32:19.600
Quark has a power bracelet?

01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:21.600
Yeah, it increases his strength.

01:32:21.600 --> 01:32:23.600
Okay, I put on my little power bracelet.

01:32:23.600 --> 01:32:25.600
Okay.

01:32:25.600 --> 01:32:27.600
And I see that I have

01:32:27.600 --> 01:32:29.600
ghost sound.

01:32:29.600 --> 01:32:31.600
Yes.

01:32:31.600 --> 01:32:33.600
Can I throw the ghost sound

01:32:33.600 --> 01:32:35.600
on the other side of the...

01:32:35.600 --> 01:32:37.600
Can you blame it on the dog?

01:32:37.600 --> 01:32:39.600
How does...

01:32:39.600 --> 01:32:41.600
I throw the ghost sound and then

01:32:41.600 --> 01:32:43.600
take my knives

01:32:43.600 --> 01:32:45.600
and throw them at the bad guy.

01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:47.600
You can't do both. You have to pick one.

01:32:47.600 --> 01:32:49.600
Alright, I'll throw my knives.

01:32:49.600 --> 01:32:51.600
Alright.

01:32:51.600 --> 01:32:53.600
But I'm making the ghost sound in my heart.

01:32:53.600 --> 01:32:55.600
In your heart?

01:32:55.600 --> 01:32:57.600
Is that like a ventriloquism thing?

01:32:57.600 --> 01:32:59.600
Is that what the ghost sound is?

01:32:59.600 --> 01:33:01.600
You can throw your voice.

01:33:01.600 --> 01:33:03.600
It's a minor sound based illusion.

01:33:03.600 --> 01:33:05.600
So you can make like a dog barking

01:33:05.600 --> 01:33:07.600
or like a rustling or twig snapping.

01:33:07.600 --> 01:33:09.600
With the ghost sound in your heart

01:33:09.600 --> 01:33:11.600
you lose 4th a dagger from your pack.

01:33:11.600 --> 01:33:13.600
And it hits.

01:33:13.600 --> 01:33:15.600
Critically so.

01:33:15.600 --> 01:33:17.600
Ha ha ha!

01:33:17.600 --> 01:33:19.600
And deals.

01:33:19.600 --> 01:33:21.600
That's 3 plus

01:33:21.600 --> 01:33:23.600
7 damage.

01:33:23.600 --> 01:33:25.600
Alright.

01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:27.600
I wink at Mulrainee as to say

01:33:27.600 --> 01:33:29.600
this is the beginning. This is the new beginning.

01:33:29.600 --> 01:33:31.600
Alright. Yeah, use your strength

01:33:31.600 --> 01:33:33.600
to throw knives. I'm going to duck in there.

01:33:33.600 --> 01:33:35.600
Get on the other side of a Christopher

01:33:35.600 --> 01:33:37.600
and just start slashing at it with my sword.

01:33:37.600 --> 01:33:39.600
The fact that I'm distracting the demon

01:33:39.600 --> 01:33:41.600
will allow you to sneak attack it

01:33:41.600 --> 01:33:43.600
and get some shots in.

01:33:43.600 --> 01:33:45.600
I mean, be careful.

01:33:45.600 --> 01:33:47.600
Great. No, no. I got your back, buddy.

01:33:47.600 --> 01:33:49.600
Hey, what's your attack bonus room?

01:33:49.600 --> 01:33:51.600
My, uh, I am at

01:33:51.600 --> 01:33:53.600
plus 8. 1 to 8 crit is

01:33:53.600 --> 01:33:55.600
times 3.

01:33:55.600 --> 01:33:57.600
That's pretty good, but not enough to hit, unfortunately.

01:33:57.600 --> 01:33:59.600
You manage to menace the demon

01:33:59.600 --> 01:34:01.600
and he's kind of occupied touching your blows.

01:34:01.600 --> 01:34:03.600
You won't defeat the Four Seasons so easily.

01:34:03.600 --> 01:34:05.600
The Four Seasons so easily.

01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:09.600
If you talk, it gives away your position.

01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:11.600
No, it's like, I'm drawing attention to you

01:34:11.600 --> 01:34:13.600
so you can stab him in the back.

01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:15.600
Oh, great. Yeah, of course. Alright, so

01:34:15.600 --> 01:34:17.600
while he is sacrificing himself

01:34:17.600 --> 01:34:19.600
very courageously

01:34:19.600 --> 01:34:21.600
I take out

01:34:21.600 --> 01:34:23.600
what's my strongest weapon

01:34:23.600 --> 01:34:25.600
that I have? A poison dagger?

01:34:25.600 --> 01:34:27.600
Yeah, probably that.

01:34:27.600 --> 01:34:29.600
Oh, yeah. I go town.

01:34:29.600 --> 01:34:31.600
I'm like

01:34:31.600 --> 01:34:33.600
puncturing lungs and shit.

01:34:33.600 --> 01:34:35.600
Going to town

01:34:35.600 --> 01:34:37.600
puncturing lungs and shit

01:34:37.600 --> 01:34:39.600
you plunge your blade

01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:41.600
deep into the demonic heart of the demon.

01:34:43.600 --> 01:34:45.600
That's what they have.

01:34:45.600 --> 01:34:47.600
Dealing

01:34:47.600 --> 01:34:49.600
10 damage.

01:34:49.600 --> 01:34:51.600
Alright. The demon clutches

01:34:51.600 --> 01:34:53.600
his demon heart and falls to the ground

01:34:53.600 --> 01:34:55.600
before dissolving

01:34:55.600 --> 01:34:57.600
into a black powder. And I point to him

01:34:57.600 --> 01:34:59.600
the way they do in basketball

01:34:59.600 --> 01:35:01.600
to whoever passed the

01:35:01.600 --> 01:35:03.600
assist.

01:35:11.600 --> 01:35:13.600
Could have been you, Quark. Could have been you.

01:35:13.600 --> 01:35:15.600
You're standing amongst like a bunch of

01:35:15.600 --> 01:35:17.600
chained slaves at this point. They look at you

01:35:17.600 --> 01:35:19.600
now that you've slain. But wait, did we kill all the enemies?

01:35:19.600 --> 01:35:21.600
You killed this enemy in this

01:35:21.600 --> 01:35:23.600
area right now. There's some enemies still around

01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:25.600
but they're going to take a bit to get to you

01:35:25.600 --> 01:35:27.600
in the brief moment.

01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:29.600
Oh, let's free some slaves.

01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:31.600
They start cheering and they're like, yeah,

01:35:31.600 --> 01:35:33.600
down with the demons.

01:35:33.600 --> 01:35:35.600
That's what we're all about.

01:35:35.600 --> 01:35:37.600
I cast slave free.

01:35:37.600 --> 01:35:39.600
Headline

01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:41.600
four score and

01:35:41.600 --> 01:35:43.600
I was also going to go with

01:35:43.600 --> 01:35:45.600
an Abraham thing, yeah.

01:35:45.600 --> 01:35:47.600
That's the first thing you think of.

01:35:47.600 --> 01:35:49.600
I'd hope so.

01:35:49.600 --> 01:35:51.600
When you learned that Abraham

01:35:51.600 --> 01:35:53.600
when you're like a kid, kid, kid

01:35:53.600 --> 01:35:55.600
would be like fifth grade

01:35:55.600 --> 01:35:57.600
and they would say Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves.

01:35:57.600 --> 01:35:59.600
Did you think they were in a container and he just opened it?

01:35:59.600 --> 01:36:01.600
Yeah.

01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:03.600
We knew what Abraham Lincoln looked like

01:36:03.600 --> 01:36:05.600
because you see him in the outfit.

01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:07.600
I really would picture him like

01:36:07.600 --> 01:36:09.600
I thought it was like my mom would be like, he freed the slaves

01:36:09.600 --> 01:36:11.600
and you're a kid, you don't know

01:36:11.600 --> 01:36:13.600
anything to do with a document that he signed.

01:36:13.600 --> 01:36:15.600
You picture this big

01:36:15.600 --> 01:36:17.600
tell skinny guy dressed in this funny hat

01:36:17.600 --> 01:36:19.600
and that he like actually went.

01:36:19.600 --> 01:36:21.600
He unlocked the chains.

01:36:21.600 --> 01:36:23.600
Think of night

01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:25.600
and people are like, wait, is that the president?

01:36:29.600 --> 01:36:31.600
Come on guys, get out of here.

01:36:31.600 --> 01:36:33.600
We caught us a war to win.

01:36:33.600 --> 01:36:35.600
I was like

01:36:35.600 --> 01:36:37.600
what is a slave?

01:36:37.600 --> 01:36:39.600
We're a very enlightened society.

01:36:39.600 --> 01:36:41.600
Pakistan doesn't have a history of slavery

01:36:41.600 --> 01:36:43.600
so not a big deal.

01:36:45.600 --> 01:36:47.600
Not a big deal at all.

01:36:47.600 --> 01:36:49.600
I mean presently, yeah

01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:51.600
we're doing horrible stuff

01:36:53.600 --> 01:36:55.600
If you have a Google alert for Pakistan

01:36:55.600 --> 01:36:57.600
it's the saddest

01:36:57.600 --> 01:36:59.600
saddest thing every day.

01:36:59.600 --> 01:37:01.600
Maybe one day you guys will have slaves.

01:37:05.600 --> 01:37:07.600
I hope so.

01:37:07.600 --> 01:37:09.600
We're at Sharpie but let's ask if any of these guys know where your father is.

01:37:11.600 --> 01:37:13.600
That's why we came back here.

01:37:13.600 --> 01:37:15.600
First we want to free him because there's other monsters here

01:37:15.600 --> 01:37:17.600
so let's capitalize on our action.

01:37:17.600 --> 01:37:19.600
I'm not giving them my bow

01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:21.600
but I could give one of them my sword if he looks healthy enough to fight.

01:37:21.600 --> 01:37:23.600
Can we sort of do the Daenerys thing

01:37:23.600 --> 01:37:25.600
where we free him and you're like

01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:27.600
you don't have to fight for us.

01:37:27.600 --> 01:37:29.600
That's definitely the angle we're going to play.

01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:33.600
I mean it'd be real cool if you did.

01:37:33.600 --> 01:37:35.600
I mean we did free you.

01:37:35.600 --> 01:37:37.600
But your freedom is yours.

01:37:37.600 --> 01:37:39.600
Let's do it.

01:37:39.600 --> 01:37:41.600
Yeah, you begin setting to work

01:37:41.600 --> 01:37:43.600
unlocking the binds on these slave guys

01:37:43.600 --> 01:37:45.600
but

01:37:45.600 --> 01:37:47.600
as you free like

01:37:47.600 --> 01:37:49.600
about three or four

01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:51.600
you hear like a slithering from behind

01:37:51.600 --> 01:37:53.600
like you might be approached

01:37:53.600 --> 01:37:55.600
by more people pretty soon.

01:37:55.600 --> 01:37:57.600
You guys free the other slaves

01:37:57.600 --> 01:37:59.600
we're going to do with this.

01:37:59.600 --> 01:38:01.600
Sounds like a good plan Quirk.

01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:03.600
Solid plan.

01:38:03.600 --> 01:38:05.600
We don't command them to do it.

01:38:05.600 --> 01:38:07.600
If you want to free them you can.

01:38:07.600 --> 01:38:09.600
We'll pay you to free the other slaves.

01:38:09.600 --> 01:38:11.600
I kind of like to go headstrong

01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:13.600
towards the noise.

01:38:13.600 --> 01:38:15.600
Okay whirling around

01:38:15.600 --> 01:38:17.600
you see a large pit in kind of

01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:19.600
the center of camp it seems kind of

01:38:19.600 --> 01:38:21.600
freshly dug and

01:38:21.600 --> 01:38:23.600
there's like a bubbling slimy sound

01:38:23.600 --> 01:38:25.600
as like several of these

01:38:25.600 --> 01:38:27.600
slimy humanoid creatures

01:38:27.600 --> 01:38:29.600
pour out of the hole and slithers

01:38:29.600 --> 01:38:31.600
towards you slowly like slugs.

01:38:31.600 --> 01:38:33.600
Well maybe

01:38:33.600 --> 01:38:35.600
are you guys good guys or bad guys?

01:38:35.600 --> 01:38:37.600
They go

01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:39.600
oh

01:38:41.600 --> 01:38:43.600
bad guys

01:38:49.600 --> 01:38:51.600
They form a wall of oozing flesh.

01:38:51.600 --> 01:38:53.600
Jeez.

01:38:53.600 --> 01:38:55.600
Yeah it's gross.

01:38:57.600 --> 01:38:59.600
What's the wall blocking?

01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:01.600
It's blocking the pit that they came out of.

01:39:01.600 --> 01:39:03.600
I mean no one wants to go there.

01:39:03.600 --> 01:39:05.600
It's like flies on shit

01:39:05.600 --> 01:39:07.600
and they're like guys don't get up.

01:39:07.600 --> 01:39:09.600
We're going to go the other way anyway.

01:39:09.600 --> 01:39:11.600
You know

01:39:11.600 --> 01:39:13.600
you walk past a turret and the flies are like

01:39:13.600 --> 01:39:15.600
whoa!

01:39:15.600 --> 01:39:17.600
Guys really stay put.

01:39:17.600 --> 01:39:19.600
You're safe.

01:39:19.600 --> 01:39:21.600
That is the one place you're safe.

01:39:23.600 --> 01:39:25.600
No one's going to squat you.

01:39:25.600 --> 01:39:27.600
The turret may.

01:39:27.600 --> 01:39:29.600
They're still coming towards you.

01:39:29.600 --> 01:39:31.600
The wall is coming.

01:39:31.600 --> 01:39:33.600
It's a wall composed of several individuals

01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:35.600
that are kind of like oozing together

01:39:35.600 --> 01:39:37.600
like they don't.

01:39:37.600 --> 01:39:39.600
I take both of my torches

01:39:39.600 --> 01:39:41.600
and I like them

01:39:41.600 --> 01:39:43.600
and I start going back and forth

01:39:43.600 --> 01:39:45.600
but facing them

01:39:45.600 --> 01:39:47.600
just to keep them away.

01:39:47.600 --> 01:39:49.600
Drawing on your religious knowledge

01:39:49.600 --> 01:39:51.600
you realize that demons are typically

01:39:51.600 --> 01:39:53.600
resistant to fire.

01:39:53.600 --> 01:39:55.600
Great so they don't want to

01:39:55.600 --> 01:39:57.600
oh.

01:39:57.600 --> 01:39:59.600
Alright.

01:40:03.600 --> 01:40:05.600
I want to use my amulet of spring

01:40:05.600 --> 01:40:07.600
to summon my thorny vine armor

01:40:07.600 --> 01:40:09.600
which it says I can command

01:40:09.600 --> 01:40:11.600
to stop protecting me

01:40:11.600 --> 01:40:13.600
and lash out to entangle a foe.

01:40:13.600 --> 01:40:15.600
So I want to do that immediately.

01:40:15.600 --> 01:40:17.600
Summoning forth

01:40:17.600 --> 01:40:19.600
the season's vine.

01:40:19.600 --> 01:40:21.600
Amulet of spring

01:40:21.600 --> 01:40:23.600
birth of rebirth

01:40:23.600 --> 01:40:25.600
thorny armor

01:40:25.600 --> 01:40:27.600
search.

01:40:31.600 --> 01:40:33.600
The vines burst forth

01:40:33.600 --> 01:40:35.600
from the ground and wrap themselves around

01:40:35.600 --> 01:40:37.600
your arm before launching off said

01:40:37.600 --> 01:40:39.600
arm towards the wall of flesh

01:40:39.600 --> 01:40:41.600
composed of the many oozy

01:40:41.600 --> 01:40:43.600
humanoid demon things.

01:40:43.600 --> 01:40:45.600
I'll see Charlie Sheen do that.

01:40:45.600 --> 01:40:47.600
He couldn't string together that sentence.

01:40:47.600 --> 01:40:49.600
It begins

01:40:49.600 --> 01:40:51.600
entangling the foes

01:40:51.600 --> 01:40:53.600
and they seem to have their forward momentum halted.

01:40:53.600 --> 01:40:55.600
It'll take them a while

01:40:55.600 --> 01:40:57.600
but they seem like they might be able to free themselves

01:40:57.600 --> 01:40:59.600
but it buys you valuable time.

01:40:59.600 --> 01:41:01.600
Alright.

01:41:01.600 --> 01:41:03.600
Let's tune into it next week.

01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:05.600
Oh is that it? That's good control.

01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:07.600
That's it. That's 10 o'clock.

01:41:07.600 --> 01:41:09.600
Yeah 5-2.

01:41:09.600 --> 01:41:11.600
I'm sorry I fucked it up.

01:41:11.600 --> 01:41:13.600
Oh no it's okay.

01:41:13.600 --> 01:41:15.600
Why not to end everybody say

01:41:15.600 --> 01:41:17.600
Yay Dan!

01:41:17.600 --> 01:41:19.600
Yay Dan!

01:41:19.600 --> 01:41:21.600
Yay Adam!

01:41:21.600 --> 01:41:23.600
Yay Adam!

01:41:23.600 --> 01:41:25.600
Yay Spencer! Thank you Kumail.

01:41:25.600 --> 01:41:27.600
Thank you Dan for controlling.

01:41:27.600 --> 01:41:29.600
Let's thank Mars Argo for coming by.

01:41:29.600 --> 01:41:31.600
Mars Argo, Titanic Sinclair and Mars Argo.

01:41:31.600 --> 01:41:33.600
Thank you Nerd Melt.

01:41:37.600 --> 01:41:39.600
Everyone be nice to each other.

01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:41.600
Comment on each other's work

01:41:41.600 --> 01:41:43.600
positively.

01:41:43.600 --> 01:41:45.600
Or don't but use your pain

01:41:45.600 --> 01:41:47.600
to create more happiness.

01:41:47.600 --> 01:41:52.600
That's all that's required.

01:42:17.600 --> 01:42:19.600
Thank you.
