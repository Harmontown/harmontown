00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Downtown Burbank.

00:10.000 --> 00:26.000
Harmontown is now in session. Let's bring out Spencer Crittenden.

00:26.000 --> 00:44.000
Alright, to my right we have Steve Libby. And the mayor of Harmontown himself, Mr. Dan Harmon.

00:44.000 --> 00:50.000
Thank you. Wow. Alright, welcome to the second episode that we've done in studio.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
I love it.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
Thank you Rob Schrab, our guest comptroller.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
You're welcome.

00:54.000 --> 00:58.000
So we're streaming live now is the difference between this week and last week.

00:58.000 --> 01:03.000
So now we're actually, even though we don't feel live, we are live.

01:03.000 --> 01:12.000
So don't launch into one of your Zionist rants, Libby, about how certain people are owed certain land.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
It's only going to get us in a lot of hot water.

01:15.000 --> 01:30.000
So tonight I want to just talk about stuff which it feels weird to talk about anything because we're in a completely different medium.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
Like now you just hear your own voice and you feel like it feels more legitimate.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
It feels like I'm a radio show host.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
Yes.

01:36.000 --> 01:44.000
It feels like I'm supposed to have a point of view or anything like that but I'm going to confine my points of view to myself like I'm always supposed to do.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
It's a comedy podcast.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
It is.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
I am a comedy podcast personality.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
People come here for the laughs.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
The funny things, my point of view.

01:53.000 --> 01:57.000
These are things that you've thought up and you're going to bring it to the attention of the audience.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
Yeah.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
So these are humorous items.

02:01.000 --> 02:07.000
But I do think we're going to end up talking a lot about the Harvey Weinstein thing and the explosion that's resulting.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
What happened?

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
I'll explain in a second.

02:10.000 --> 02:15.000
All right. We should probably do some kind of title sequence for this segment, right?

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
Oh, the heart.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
You want to skip right to that.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
The headline item.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
Yeah.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
Okay.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
Here comes Dan Harmon's Headlines.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
Oh, this is the overview.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
Yeah.

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
Well, I keep biting my own lip and not in a sexy way.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
That's one of the things that.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
Which part?

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
The inside.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
Like right on the inside.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
Do you get cankers?

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
Do you get cankers?

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
I do now.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
It's a self-created canker.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
This is the headline.

02:42.000 --> 02:46.000
Let's not let the preview text go longer than two lines.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
Back it up.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
That's number one.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
Number two, Dick and Morty.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
Oh, boy.

02:51.000 --> 03:01.000
I saw a trailer for Rick and Morty, Port and Perity, that I haven't even stopped to examine whether my feelings are good, bad, or anything.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
I'm just excited.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
It's the best of both worlds.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
How many?

03:05.000 --> 03:15.000
The tangible nominal name recognition and basic physical resemblance to Rick and Morty.

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
And then you have real people having sex.

03:18.000 --> 03:23.000
It's truly what some weirdo who has a weird fetish for Rick and Morty would like.

03:23.000 --> 03:29.000
And not just, you know, in assholes interpretation of what one of those fans would like.

03:29.000 --> 03:33.000
We're talking about this a lot longer than just a headline.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
Oh, shit.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
Maybe like the rule guy.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
I'm sorry.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
That was one item.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
Right?

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
Yeah.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
Okay.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
I watched my cousin Vinny and it kind of holds up in some ways.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
Okay.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
Good.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
The Me Too Facebook thing.

03:46.000 --> 03:50.000
That's kind of a related to the Weinstein thing.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
Rose McGowan.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
McGowan.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
Whether we should.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
Coming and going.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
That was one of my, is it Gowan or Gowan?

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
I think it's Gowan.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
Yeah, I think it's McGowan.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
All right.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
Rose McGowan.

04:02.000 --> 04:07.000
Let's have a big conversation about how we are and aren't supposed to say things.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
Starting with the word McGowan McGowan.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
But that's all the same thing.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
That, the Me Too Facebook thing and the Weinstein thing.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
That's all the same topic.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
What's the Me Too Facebook thing?

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
Yeah.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
You say Me Too.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
That's something Cody told me about.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
But if I start talking about it.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
Okay.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
We're still in the title sequence.

04:23.000 --> 04:27.000
Then I wrote down power dynamics just because, but really isn't that the same thing?

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
And then I wrote down the word, I wrote down the word sex worker.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
Let's start with that because that just has such a quick shuffle.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
Sex worker.

04:34.000 --> 04:39.000
Let's call this segment, what did I miss?

04:39.000 --> 04:45.000
How do you know when you're finished?

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
The word prostitute is problematic now, right?

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
Yeah.

04:49.000 --> 04:55.000
You at home, I'm not doing a sarcastic bit where I'm like going like, you tell me exactly,

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
but that is what I'm doing, but I'm not doing it in parody.

04:58.000 --> 05:04.000
I'm being sincere and wanting to talk about words that into the radar that I don't know

05:04.000 --> 05:08.000
how much longer than the word prostitute has been.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
Is it?

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
On the chopping block that I've been using it.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
Well, it's the oldest profession.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
What'd you say?

05:14.000 --> 05:19.000
It's the oldest profession.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
It's so, but there's the idea.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
What's problematic?

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
Well, I don't know.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
I don't think that's any.

05:26.000 --> 05:31.000
I think sex worker is a more encompassing term that applies to more people, but I don't

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
know that prostitute is necessarily, I mean, it might be.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
What's the difference?

05:35.000 --> 05:41.000
Well, you could be, for instance, like a, I don't want to say a cam whore, but you could

05:41.000 --> 05:47.000
be a cam model and that's not necessarily a prostitute, but it is sex work.

05:47.000 --> 05:51.000
Is adult film acting a sex worker?

05:51.000 --> 05:58.000
They're not offended by being lumped in with, is it that we're knocking off?

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
Are we merging the idea that sex work is sex work?

06:01.000 --> 06:06.000
Because we want to not say, because it's too biblical and provincial probably to go.

06:06.000 --> 06:13.000
Well, your sex work involves really meaning it or something like, like we've been, we've

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
been, it's these divisions that need to go probably as part of it.

06:16.000 --> 06:21.000
I think it's a prostitute is a, I mean, it's only one kind of sex work.

06:21.000 --> 06:25.000
And so if you're like, oh, you're just a prostitute and they're like, no, I'm a sex worker.

06:25.000 --> 06:29.000
Then it's like, you're kind of putting him in a more narrow box where they meet people

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
and have sex with them when that might not be what's for sale.

06:31.000 --> 06:36.000
You know, like even, like even a dominatrix might not just meet people and have sex with

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
them, but they're almost certainly a sex worker.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
Yeah.

06:39.000 --> 06:43.000
I had an ex-girlfriend who worked, she worked as a, she never, she never touched anybody.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
She was a, she, her job was to like whip guys in a dungeon.

06:45.000 --> 06:50.000
Something happened to my microphone or my headphones or my ego and, and that I, and

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
I can't hear myself.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
I can hear you.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
I can hear your fine.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
All right.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
So you can't hear your voice at all in your cans.

06:56.000 --> 07:00.000
It's like, it's like drifting in and out now, like as if I'm subject to some kind of voice

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
activated network.

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
Maybe you're, maybe you're losing your hearing.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
Great.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
Great.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
Now is the time to find out.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
All right.

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
So it's like, it's, it's hard to have these conversations because I want to like, I can,

07:14.000 --> 07:21.000
I sound like what I know the bad guy in my head sounds like when I have potentially passive

07:21.000 --> 07:25.000
aggressive conversations, which is not what I'm trying to do about the actual, I'm fascinated

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
and I do welcome the evolution of language.

07:28.000 --> 07:34.000
I see, I don't, I'm not, I'm not a person that wants to caution against the slippery slope

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
of modifying language, even though I was 20 years ago.

07:37.000 --> 07:41.000
Like now I look at it differently and I'm fascinated by it.

07:41.000 --> 07:46.000
That's why I like having these conversations with like, like, like you, it's, it's not

07:46.000 --> 07:53.000
every day that you, someone lets you know that a word you're using is like changing

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
and it's like fashion, fashion ability.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
Is that how this started?

07:57.000 --> 08:02.000
You were, you were saying, well, you know, these prostitutes and some of them went.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
Yeah.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
I can't remember.

08:04.000 --> 08:08.000
And I'm not going to, it's not, it's not anecdote worthy that conversation.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
Okay.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
Not at all.

08:10.000 --> 08:17.000
It's more like, it's, here's what, here's what kind of interests me about it is like,

08:17.000 --> 08:23.000
we don't have a, we don't, we don't, we, how do you tell what, there's no newsletter

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
and that's what the bad guys say.

08:25.000 --> 08:29.000
Well, you told me the rules like, and it's like, no, why don't you, why don't you fucking

08:29.000 --> 08:35.000
think, but well, when was I supposed to think about that as opposed to salt, pepper and

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
other words that I use completely unconsciously.

08:38.000 --> 08:42.000
And this ties into everything that we'll be talking about that isn't funny because it's

08:42.000 --> 08:48.000
not a comedy podcast and I'm not being funny and I don't, why did the chicken do the thing?

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
I don't know because he felt disempowered.

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
I'm going to talk about whatever I want to talk about.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
I know that I keep doing this where I keep lashing out at a hypothetical audience and

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
saying that I hate you and you're like, we didn't hate you.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
Why are you yelling at me?

08:59.000 --> 09:04.000
But I do, I just like, if you're, right now, if you're judging me, you know who you are.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
I don't, I judge you back.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
I judge you harder.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
I judge you first.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
I don't like you.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
I don't like you.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
I don't, I never liked you.

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
And me liking you means more than you not liking me.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
You're done.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
You lost.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
You're at a crater.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
You're not even a person.

09:19.000 --> 09:24.000
You're a crater with shoes that just moves around wherever you stand identifies the point

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
where I have, I have power over you.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
So stop judging me.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
You've been judged.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
I'm going to proceed with my podcast.

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
I don't know if I'm going to be funny, political, what side I'm on.

09:33.000 --> 09:38.000
But when I'm talking and when there's diarrhea coming out of my mouth that's doing good.

09:38.000 --> 09:42.000
And when it's doing bad, I just talk and it's become my job.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
I've given it to myself as a job.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
Here's how I feel tonight about the following things.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
Sorry I said all that.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
No.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
All right.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
Here we go.

09:51.000 --> 09:55.000
So topic, topic number one or descending order.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
Well, okay.

09:56.000 --> 10:00.000
My therapist said, you know what's happening right now.

10:00.000 --> 10:08.000
Men, women, Weinstein, whatever the language arguments, everything what's happening right

10:08.000 --> 10:12.000
now is a revolution of consciousness versus unconsciousness.

10:12.000 --> 10:18.000
So all of the things that you're doing and saying and being without thinking about them,

10:18.000 --> 10:25.000
that has become the new thing that we're recognizing as problematic.

10:25.000 --> 10:31.000
And what we're starting to put a higher value on and trying to create a society based on

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
are the things that we're thinking about.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
Say that again.

10:36.000 --> 10:41.000
It's consciousness versus unconsciousness.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
Okay.

10:42.000 --> 10:46.000
So we've come out of an era of celebrating unconsciousness.

10:46.000 --> 10:50.000
Can you give me an example of the old era versus the new era?

10:50.000 --> 10:56.000
Not like the archetype of the narcissist being like kind of a hero.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
That's the old way.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
Yeah.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
Okay.

10:59.000 --> 11:03.000
We're starting to, the narcissism is starting to be looked at.

11:03.000 --> 11:11.000
It's not like anti-hero, cool, like, oh, you're another person that isn't thinking about

11:11.000 --> 11:14.000
anybody but themselves and you're sucking your thumb and stamping your feet.

11:14.000 --> 11:19.000
That was pretty chic three and a half fiscal quarters ago socially.

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
We're just, the bubble has burst on that market.

11:22.000 --> 11:27.000
I'm putting words in my therapist's mouth because she's not thinking of things.

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
I'm trying to figure it out.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
Okay.

11:31.000 --> 11:36.000
So when I think narcissists, like in terms of like television and movie, I think it's

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
like somebody like Ted Danson in Cheers.

11:38.000 --> 11:43.000
Is that the old way or people are starting to, people used to think like, oh, that guy's

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
like a scoundrel.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
He's an asshole.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
But now is that person a hero or is it the opposite?

11:47.000 --> 11:50.800
I think we're starting to, we're starting to, that's gone out of fashion.

11:50.800 --> 11:52.000
If you picked that character.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
Okay.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
That's Jeff Wenger from Cheers.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
Right.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
That's Larry David and Curb Your Enthusiasm.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
Okay.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
Okay.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
This is everybody.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
Right.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
Everybody is now a-

12:01.000 --> 12:06.000
This is all the funny, this is the funny from like for a long time.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
Right.

12:07.000 --> 12:12.000
And the new hero is like say, what, is there a new example?

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
Like Jay Berischel?

12:14.000 --> 12:22.000
People who know themselves, people who are, I don't, you're, I know you're not doing anything,

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
you're not trying to do anything to me.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
No, no, I'm trying to understand.

12:27.000 --> 12:33.000
I feel like you're tumbling me over into a whole like where I'm pitching you what's funny

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
and what's not funny.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
No, no, no, no, no.

12:35.000 --> 12:39.000
I just want to understand what you're, I'm a visual person.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
So, you know, I just, I'm trying to follow you.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
I can back off.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
Back it up.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
No, no, no.

12:44.000 --> 12:48.000
Just think, or let's, let's come back, let's think about ourselves for a second.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
Okay.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
All right.

12:50.000 --> 12:57.000
So, how much have you been thinking about what you actually feel like what you want to

12:57.000 --> 13:01.000
be right and wrong and what you've stuff like for instance, you, in the time that I've

13:01.000 --> 13:06.000
known you, you became like a animal person.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
Yes.

13:07.000 --> 13:13.000
And that graduated from your love of your dog to not that I'm tracing your, your evolution.

13:13.000 --> 13:17.000
I'm just saying like, that's how I remember the events happening.

13:17.000 --> 13:22.000
And then there was a certain point where you, you became vegetarian or vegan and you became

13:22.000 --> 13:27.000
like, you know, you don't, you think that you, you, you became guided by a new principle.

13:27.000 --> 13:34.000
You, you, you, and it was based on you deciding for yourself that you don't want regardless

13:34.000 --> 13:38.000
of what you think is right for the world or what everyone should do.

13:38.000 --> 13:42.000
You had to start with yourself and you had to go, I like animals.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
Like I don't want to hurt them.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
Yes.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
And that changed about you.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
Yeah.

13:47.000 --> 13:50.000
That is, that is something that's a major change.

13:50.000 --> 13:55.000
So what if, you know, like what if what's going on with the Weinstein thing is like a chance

13:55.000 --> 14:05.000
for guys like me to, you know, have a similar level of inventory taking about our relationship

14:05.000 --> 14:09.000
with women, which just equated them with food.

14:09.000 --> 14:14.000
But it could be part of the point, but, but like, I have been, I don't know about you,

14:14.000 --> 14:23.000
but I imagine every guy has been kind of like looking past the shoebox of what you're like,

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
like what is supposed to be happening.

14:25.000 --> 14:29.000
And then you've been checking in with like some lower gut, right?

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
Yeah.

14:30.000 --> 14:37.000
Well, I mean, just in terms of like in the last couple of years, like just I like Kate

14:37.000 --> 14:42.000
has really helped me like see things that I haven't noticed before because it's been

14:42.000 --> 14:48.000
so normalized, you know, in terms of like entertainment and TV and just how people treat each other.

14:48.000 --> 14:53.000
And I'm blind to it because I'm the only person that I've ever been.

14:53.000 --> 14:57.000
And, you know, I have my own problem.

14:57.000 --> 15:02.000
So, you know, like having Kate like kind of point things out to me, it starts being more

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
and more aware.

15:03.000 --> 15:08.000
And then when things like this start happening, you know, the shit that's happening with

15:08.000 --> 15:15.000
with Rose McGowan on Twitter and, you know, everybody coming out and just it's, it is,

15:15.000 --> 15:22.000
I do feel like, man, you know, why have I, I've been a part of the problem for my entire

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
life.

15:23.000 --> 15:27.000
You've been going back through your whole life, haven't you, for the last couple of weeks?

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
Absolutely.

15:28.000 --> 15:34.000
The same way when I went vegan, like, I mean, I went went that way because of absolute like

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
guilt.

15:35.000 --> 15:42.000
And I've been such a like overzealous, you know, trying to find like that happy medium

15:42.000 --> 15:48.000
where I'm, you know, trying to tell people what I'm going through and why it happened

15:48.000 --> 15:53.000
and without, you know, putting people off, you know, which, which, you know, this is,

15:53.000 --> 15:57.000
you know, what women, you know, you know, like, they're in that same position where

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
they're like, no, you got to listen to me.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
This is what I'm going through.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
But you don't want to be a buzzkill, a pain.

16:03.000 --> 16:07.000
No one wants to hear anybody whine and complain about stuff like that.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
Right.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
Well, people don't want to feel guilty.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
They don't want to feel uncomfortable and guilty.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
So they avoid the conversation or they roll their eyes or they walk away.

16:15.000 --> 16:19.000
We're all having conversations right now where we're catching ourselves and each other in

16:19.000 --> 16:25.000
at a rate of like, way, for me, way faster, more infractions per minute too, because that's

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
the topic that's being talked about.

16:27.000 --> 16:35.000
So it's kind of like, it's like, one thing I want to say to my, my brother out there

16:35.000 --> 16:42.000
and bones is, why are you raising my niece on Facebook?

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
I, I, I, I've never met her.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
Are you really that mad?

16:46.000 --> 16:47.000
I talked about you.

16:47.000 --> 16:54.000
The, the, no, my actual brother, which is the public, but the, and the male half of that

16:54.000 --> 17:00.000
public, like, I keep thinking to myself, I keep going, like, you know what, what we're

17:00.000 --> 17:07.000
watching play out is, is this, there's this part of it that we own, which is the, the

17:07.000 --> 17:14.000
easy part, it's the, it's the not thinking about it part where, because don't you find

17:14.000 --> 17:21.000
yourself every day, like, like, is that like thinking something and then because you're

17:21.000 --> 17:28.000
old and rich and bored and tired, maybe like, let's get, let's give a break to our, our

17:28.000 --> 17:34.000
dream to up a 20 year old brethren who, because I just remember being a piece of fucking shit

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
the further back you go.

17:36.000 --> 17:43.000
So I can't judge today's 23 year old because if I was a guest on this podcast at the age

17:43.000 --> 17:53.000
of 23, I as a 44 year old minus that awareness would, would like make a fucking huge show

17:53.000 --> 17:57.000
of telling him what a big dumb piece of shit he was and it wouldn't help him.

17:57.000 --> 18:01.000
It's just, you know, it's like, you know, old people telling is like, why do you got

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
to dress like that?

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
Why are you listening to that garbage music?

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
It's not real music or whatever.

18:06.000 --> 18:11.000
And, you know, it's just how, because they're new to the world and they're, they're trying

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
out stuff.

18:12.000 --> 18:17.000
And there aren't any classes in any of this because you can't charge money for it effectively

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
without becoming litigatable.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
In other words, we don't have a culture.

18:21.000 --> 18:26.000
We don't have, like, we used to, we make, we rightfully make fun of our forebears for

18:26.000 --> 18:31.000
having these, like, these horrible classes societies that, and part of it was, okay,

18:31.000 --> 18:35.000
here's the book on whether a woman gets into an elevator first and all of this shit.

18:35.000 --> 18:40.000
And all of that stuff is rightfully, like, we spit on it, we wipe our asses with it.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
So uncool.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
The Fonz doesn't have that book.

18:43.000 --> 18:48.000
The Fonz just does, it's all about like, that American value system of like, why would

18:48.000 --> 18:53.000
you ever, why would you have a rule book for interacting with blah, blah, blah?

18:53.000 --> 18:56.000
It's great that we threw that in the furnace and all that stuff.

18:56.000 --> 19:05.600
And then now you have this thing of like, wait, you mean being 15 years old and not having

19:05.600 --> 19:14.360
ever any conversations about what we're supposed to be doing and what's going on in any fucking

19:14.360 --> 19:19.600
way that me, that drives all of society, like, oh, you mean I should just, I'll just figure

19:19.600 --> 19:24.440
that shit out and part of it will be owned by my parents and that'll be owned by what

19:24.440 --> 19:29.400
city or state they live in and that'll be whatever high school I went to, subdivisions,

19:29.400 --> 19:34.000
what base I am, what class I am, what income bracket, what, there was a freeway within

19:34.000 --> 19:38.760
50 yards of me or a power line, it's like, how is that shit?

19:38.760 --> 19:46.600
So like, we done fucked up in one regard, like, we don't have training.

19:46.600 --> 19:47.600
We're not telling kids.

19:47.600 --> 19:50.880
We have movies and TV, that's our only training.

19:50.880 --> 19:51.880
Sex ed classes.

19:51.880 --> 19:58.040
But that's not interaction, you know, what we, I mean, physical interaction.

19:58.040 --> 20:00.560
Let's just put, like, why are you arguing?

20:00.560 --> 20:02.400
I don't know what you guys are arguing.

20:02.400 --> 20:05.040
Right, right, no, you're policing absolute statements.

20:05.040 --> 20:10.640
I'm expressing a point which is, we're in a mire of non-education about how to interact

20:10.640 --> 20:11.640
with each other.

20:11.640 --> 20:17.920
I don't, I think, I think in today in 2017, sex ed classes are maybe more robust than they've

20:17.920 --> 20:18.920
ever been.

20:18.920 --> 20:19.920
Okay.

20:19.920 --> 20:20.920
But, but, so, okay.

20:20.920 --> 20:23.920
So Spencer's argument is that today's society has gotten, so, okay.

20:23.920 --> 20:28.000
I don't think there used to be conversations on consent back in the past.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
All right.

20:29.000 --> 20:33.880
So, so, so, right now, what you're saying is the problem has been solved.

20:33.880 --> 20:39.880
No, I don't, I'm saying there are discussions, I mean, like in classrooms, you're saying

20:39.880 --> 20:40.880
that there's not.

20:40.880 --> 20:41.880
Nope.

20:41.880 --> 20:42.880
I think there are.

20:42.880 --> 20:43.880
Okay.

20:43.880 --> 20:44.880
I think there's an issue.

20:44.880 --> 20:51.640
I'm not going to be able to, yeah, a lot of, nothing I say for the next 40 to 60 minutes

20:51.640 --> 20:53.760
is going to actually be factual.

20:53.760 --> 20:54.760
Okay.

20:54.760 --> 20:55.760
Okay.

20:55.760 --> 20:56.760
I'm pretending.

20:56.760 --> 20:59.520
I'm making pretends.

20:59.520 --> 21:07.280
The, so, we don't have, we have no sexual culture in our, in modern society.

21:07.280 --> 21:09.760
We are, we are mystifying it.

21:09.760 --> 21:17.120
We are telling each other in random combinations that it's, it's up to you, be yourself, like,

21:17.120 --> 21:23.240
oh, it's nature, it's nurture, we don't, we are, we are, it is a fundamental thing about

21:23.240 --> 21:28.200
us, the way that we interact with each other, and it is the most mystical thing.

21:28.200 --> 21:32.600
It's the thing that we just let be adrift, because the alternative would be to have rules

21:32.600 --> 21:39.640
for that shit, which we interpret as being like a horrible idea, because of the culture

21:39.640 --> 21:44.120
that we've come from, where there were a lot of rules for that shit.

21:44.120 --> 21:46.200
So what do we do?

21:46.200 --> 21:51.000
How do we combat that without going hierarchical, without going, having the pendulum swing back?

21:51.000 --> 21:53.040
The only answer is just communication.

21:53.040 --> 21:59.520
It's just a, it's a, it's everybody saying, when you hear something, when you see something,

21:59.520 --> 22:04.800
then like, we have to like, figure out how we actually feel about it, because when we

22:04.800 --> 22:09.320
keep talking to each other about it, like, we keep, we keep doing wrong.

22:09.320 --> 22:16.320
I think we've created like a, a culture for instance, to use the women thing that is going

22:16.320 --> 22:20.920
on right now, a culture of silence, that we can contribute without even knowing it.

22:20.920 --> 22:24.720
So how many times, I mean, like, we don't have to play some weird confession game, but

22:24.720 --> 22:31.400
like, how complicit do you feel, like, when you see that stuff, you go like, yeah, you

22:31.400 --> 22:39.280
know what, I, yeah, I, I, I, I, it gets frustrating because I look back at high school and, and

22:39.280 --> 22:45.240
where we were, nobody sits down and tells you how to interact with people.

22:45.240 --> 22:51.440
You know, men, women, you know, young, old, they don't sit you down and you, you're just

22:51.440 --> 22:55.120
kind of thrown into the woods and you got to figure it out on your own.

22:55.120 --> 23:00.600
And so you get like all these beta males who are, you know, like weaker or not as confident.

23:00.600 --> 23:05.440
And then they, they get into these positions of power and they still don't know how to deal

23:05.440 --> 23:07.360
with people and they don't know how to deal with women.

23:07.360 --> 23:13.880
You also think, and I'm speaking for myself, you think as a nerd that there's like this

23:13.880 --> 23:19.240
mythology you're following from our generation, let's be specific about that, like, and speaking

23:19.240 --> 23:20.240
for myself.

23:20.240 --> 23:26.600
It's like, oh yeah, like if you're a nerd, then you can compensate, you can become the

23:26.600 --> 23:31.340
jock of having, of being a nerd with power, with money, with something to offer.

23:31.340 --> 23:32.840
That's what happened with Weinstein, I think.

23:32.840 --> 23:38.880
And it gets translated into sex somewhere in your workflow, unless you're blessed enough

23:38.880 --> 23:45.040
to be, yeah, like neurologically asexual, like if you, if, if, if they, it somehow gets

23:45.040 --> 23:51.280
tied in because there's no conversation about where I have abused my power dynamic at work.

23:51.280 --> 23:54.160
I, I, I didn't know I was doing it when I did it.

23:54.160 --> 24:01.240
I, I didn't, I never took notice that I never thought to myself until after the whole thing

24:01.240 --> 24:05.280
happened and I looked back and was like, why was that such a relative disaster?

24:05.280 --> 24:13.760
Oh, because if you have a crush on someone that works for you, you are not, it's not

24:13.760 --> 24:20.280
the same as having a crush on someone at a library or a bar that doesn't work for you.

24:20.280 --> 24:21.520
You fucking idiot.

24:21.520 --> 24:22.520
Yeah.

24:22.520 --> 24:29.960
I, but I don't, it's like, that is happening on every block in every, and then in our industry

24:29.960 --> 24:34.720
that's like, because you, like, we're not, we're not going like, okay, I, oh shit.

24:34.720 --> 24:36.920
Uh, I have a crush on Stacy.

24:36.920 --> 24:42.440
Uh, I wonder, I bet, I should just see if she wants to go to that thing or whatever.

24:42.440 --> 24:47.440
And you're not, who's going to stop and ask themself, oh, am I really giving Stacy the

24:47.440 --> 24:54.160
opportunity to, um, not be interested in going to see a movie with me and also continuing

24:54.160 --> 24:59.920
to know whether or not she's good at being a writer or whether, like, you don't, like,

24:59.920 --> 25:06.640
there is no, there was no, um, but you're going on Batman, the ride sign and line that

25:06.640 --> 25:15.080
I waited in documentation, I, I found, I, I got that into my head by doing it wrong.

25:15.080 --> 25:19.920
I did it wrong and I'm really ashamed of it when I look back on it.

25:19.920 --> 25:27.720
Fortunately for me, I'm not like, like, I, I, I, like, I, like, I never, it's just like,

25:27.720 --> 25:28.720
that's part of that nerd thing.

25:28.720 --> 25:33.880
Yeah, but I know, I never did anything and then, uh, like, but that doesn't matter.

25:33.880 --> 25:37.520
It's like, like, the problem exists on the root level of your brain is like, what if you

25:37.520 --> 25:39.640
could have done something?

25:39.640 --> 25:41.560
What if you could have gotten your way?

25:41.560 --> 25:42.560
You could have.

25:42.560 --> 25:43.560
You could have.

25:43.560 --> 25:44.560
You could have.

25:44.560 --> 25:48.200
You only knew, you only know at the time, like, that you, what you want.

25:48.200 --> 25:51.840
And then we're, and then you're used to thinking of yourself as an underdog and you go like,

25:51.840 --> 25:57.040
well, I, like that in the movies and the TV shows, it's like, oh, the guy that uses everything

25:57.040 --> 26:01.320
he's got going for him to turn things around with a special lady.

26:01.320 --> 26:03.120
It's like, because you don't play sports.

26:03.120 --> 26:07.400
You're not going to, you know, I'm not going to be a date rapist because I'm the underdog.

26:07.400 --> 26:08.400
I'm the, I'm the guy.

26:08.400 --> 26:10.400
Well, I'm never going to be wearing a polo shirt.

26:10.400 --> 26:11.720
I'm never going to be wearing a mask.

26:11.720 --> 26:13.200
They're never, they'll never be on my yacht.

26:13.200 --> 26:14.720
I'll never date rape anyone.

26:14.720 --> 26:15.720
Sure.

26:15.720 --> 26:16.720
Yeah.

26:16.720 --> 26:17.720
Every, when we, yeah.

26:17.720 --> 26:20.640
So, well, I'm not, I'm not lecturing anybody watching or listening.

26:20.640 --> 26:21.720
I'm, I'm talking to myself.

26:21.720 --> 26:29.400
I just want, I was eager to, when we saw that Terry Crews thing on Twitter, like, I, like,

26:29.400 --> 26:38.840
like, I fucking like, I'm in, I'm in a post Terry Crews six tweet thread Harmon Soul.

26:38.840 --> 26:44.720
And it's not because of what it's not, it's because of what I realized about myself when

26:44.720 --> 26:46.360
I read that thing.

26:46.360 --> 26:55.040
Because I read through it and Terry Crews is a gigantic, physically fit, like, charming

26:55.040 --> 27:01.360
alpha beyond alpha dude who's just saying, yeah, one time I went to a party and my drunk

27:01.360 --> 27:05.080
boss came up to me and grabbed my nuts and there was nothing I could do about it.

27:05.080 --> 27:07.080
And I was all bummed out and I froze.

27:07.080 --> 27:08.640
And then I was like, what the fuck was that?

27:08.640 --> 27:13.520
And my wife was like, don't do anything about it because if you do what, what do you gain

27:13.520 --> 27:14.680
versus what do you lose?

27:14.680 --> 27:15.680
Blah, blah, blah.

27:15.680 --> 27:16.680
I'm not.

27:16.680 --> 27:20.960
I just put words in Terry Crews' wife's mouth that I paraphrased that, but that was like

27:20.960 --> 27:21.960
a conversation.

27:21.960 --> 27:22.960
But that was the party.

27:22.960 --> 27:26.960
She wasn't like Lady Macbeth of the Matrix going like, oh, what have you got to lose by

27:26.960 --> 27:28.840
acquiescing to the nut grabbing?

27:28.840 --> 27:29.840
No.

27:29.840 --> 27:37.680
But his point was he froze and was like, like, and then it happened.

27:37.680 --> 27:40.680
And then, and then he didn't talk about it, et cetera.

27:40.680 --> 27:46.280
So his point was if I can be a victim and Matt, you know, now are you listening and

27:46.280 --> 27:47.280
a point well taken?

27:47.280 --> 27:53.400
But the reason why I am shattered to the core by that story is because I read it and the

27:53.400 --> 28:00.600
entire time I'm reading it, I'm going no way or like, I want to read that differently.

28:00.600 --> 28:04.280
That's this is the important thing is that I'm going, I'm like, I'm reading the Terry

28:04.280 --> 28:14.400
Crews thing and I'm going no way that's and if and then realizing that why is that story?

28:14.400 --> 28:16.760
Like is it more believable to me?

28:16.760 --> 28:22.280
It's less believable narratively, which makes it for good storytelling.

28:22.280 --> 28:25.480
Oh, no way.

28:25.480 --> 28:27.560
Jack went up a beanstalk.

28:27.560 --> 28:28.760
Wow.

28:28.760 --> 28:29.760
No way.

28:29.760 --> 28:32.720
Terry Crews got got sexually assaulted.

28:32.720 --> 28:39.360
It's a simultaneous expression of disbelief and I'm, I'm all over it and I'm so invested

28:39.360 --> 28:43.320
and I have not, I like, yeah, awesome.

28:43.320 --> 28:47.240
Like not awesome that it happened, but like, no way are you fucking kidding me when we

28:47.240 --> 28:54.560
express incredulity skepticism and I was like, wait, how is this different from like, I don't

28:54.560 --> 29:01.440
know how I caught myself, but imagining that any woman, any woman, 240 pound black muscle

29:01.440 --> 29:03.160
bound woman doesn't really matter.

29:03.160 --> 29:08.680
Like, like, like, I don't think I just picturing just, okay, change his gender, just change

29:08.680 --> 29:11.840
Terry Crews to a woman.

29:11.840 --> 29:19.440
And I was like, I, I, I'm rattling with the realization that there was like a clear difference

29:19.440 --> 29:26.000
for me that that when a woman, when I hear about a woman being like having this crazy

29:26.000 --> 29:35.360
shit happen to her, uh, it, I have some kind of like force field that it just needs to,

29:35.360 --> 29:36.360
there's just a little checkpoint.

29:36.360 --> 29:37.840
That's just, there's no big deal.

29:37.840 --> 29:40.400
I just need to see your ID before you get on the plane.

29:40.400 --> 29:41.640
That's no big deal.

29:41.640 --> 29:43.400
Everyone can get on a plane.

29:43.400 --> 29:47.880
There's a fucking checkpoint there that I saw where I was like, I, I, I, it wasn't placed

29:47.880 --> 29:48.880
there consciously.

29:48.880 --> 29:50.040
I do not choose.

29:50.040 --> 29:51.120
I was not choosing.

29:51.120 --> 29:52.200
I never chose.

29:52.200 --> 29:53.920
I never knew.

29:53.920 --> 29:58.840
That's why I was shook to the fucking core because I was like, the fuck is your problem?

29:58.840 --> 30:04.200
And then I started, you found it, you found it less believable or less when a woman tells

30:04.200 --> 30:10.080
me a story when in the past, when a woman has told me a story, whether it's not one

30:10.080 --> 30:13.840
of she's coming to me as an employer and say, whatever, when it gets official and all that

30:13.840 --> 30:18.360
stuff, equally important conversation about what we do in the workplace, not stuff.

30:18.360 --> 30:27.440
I'm talking about when a woman is confiding in you that some, something insane happened

30:27.440 --> 30:34.040
to her at the hands of a predator in the moment.

30:34.040 --> 30:38.520
Some of these, these seconds, Terry Cruz's story is three and a half seconds long, really.

30:38.520 --> 30:44.000
Six tweets, three and a half seconds, drunk boss in the middle of everyone at the, I'm

30:44.000 --> 30:50.080
assuming I pictured on a dance floor, it really doesn't matter, but anyways, but like, like

30:50.080 --> 30:57.560
these stories, like I in my head, I look back over my whole life and I, it's not, it's not

30:57.560 --> 31:00.600
as simple as I believe women less.

31:00.600 --> 31:07.640
I think the irony is that it has something to do with this chivalry, you're in charge.

31:07.640 --> 31:12.560
That's why they're telling you in the first place, you're, you're, you have to decide

31:12.560 --> 31:17.160
when Terry Cruz tells me a guy grabbed his nuts at a party, I don't have to decide what

31:17.160 --> 31:18.600
to do about it.

31:18.600 --> 31:21.500
I don't have to, I'm not in charge of whether it's true.

31:21.500 --> 31:23.880
So I just fucking believe it.

31:23.880 --> 31:28.760
And my immediate reaction is, well, let's not work with that guy ever again.

31:28.760 --> 31:33.920
And I look back through my life and I'm realizing that like women saying like, you know, that

31:33.920 --> 31:39.840
guy on the corner, not work related, like whatever, your neighbor or this, this happened

31:39.840 --> 31:44.320
to me or that waiter at that restaurant, we were getting scrambled eggs and then he

31:44.320 --> 31:46.360
said this or that.

31:46.360 --> 31:48.880
And I have the same verbal outward reaction.

31:48.880 --> 31:51.000
So no one can police it.

31:51.000 --> 31:54.000
I go, no way.

31:54.000 --> 31:59.280
But I, when I read the Terry Cruz thing, I was like, I saw like, I don't care if you

31:59.280 --> 32:04.400
call it a nanometer or a millimeter or a foot or 20 yards, a difference.

32:04.400 --> 32:06.200
I have a different setting.

32:06.200 --> 32:08.560
I think it's because we're supposed to be cowboys.

32:08.560 --> 32:14.080
I said, like, like, like, we're like, okay, now Stacy, no, no, just, just give me one

32:14.080 --> 32:16.400
second to take that in.

32:16.400 --> 32:20.120
That's interesting that you're saying because if I go up to Arnold, the bus boy at Grand

32:20.120 --> 32:25.200
Buffet and punch him out, like that's all the unspoken stuff is like, yeah, no one

32:25.200 --> 32:28.560
asked you to do anything except believe them.

32:28.560 --> 32:32.560
And that, but you're already in this like Fonzie mode of like, now hold on, are you

32:32.560 --> 32:37.840
trying to use my Fonzie strength to, you're not going to do anything anyway.

32:37.840 --> 32:41.160
But like, your brain is like, my brain has been wired.

32:41.160 --> 32:42.160
What happened?

32:42.160 --> 32:43.160
Nothing.

32:43.160 --> 32:44.160
Oh.

32:44.160 --> 32:45.160
All right.

32:45.160 --> 32:51.800
Well, anyways, but I think that's an interesting point that that that when a guy says, oh,

32:51.800 --> 32:56.320
this happened to me, you go, oh, wow, and you don't feel responsible, but like, if a

32:56.320 --> 33:02.400
woman says something to you, you part of it, I mean, like, I used to get mad, I go, like,

33:02.400 --> 33:05.720
now I am, you want me to beat this person up?

33:05.720 --> 33:06.720
Yeah.

33:06.720 --> 33:08.320
I suppose, are you sure?

33:08.320 --> 33:11.640
Because I got, I don't want to, I don't want to get into rack with something.

33:11.640 --> 33:17.760
I don't, I'm not good at what it just, it all becomes like, ooh, this hurts me when

33:17.760 --> 33:18.760
a crisis happened.

33:18.760 --> 33:23.200
Somebody else is like, look, no, just believe me and comfort me.

33:23.200 --> 33:24.200
So yeah.

33:24.200 --> 33:26.200
And trace it back to like Terry Cruz.

33:26.200 --> 33:29.200
It's like, it's like, he's not asking you to do anything.

33:29.200 --> 33:30.200
Yeah.

33:30.200 --> 33:35.040
That's a, and then if you said that to women, then they would go, I wasn't, I wanted you

33:35.040 --> 33:36.040
to believe me.

33:36.040 --> 33:37.040
Yeah.

33:37.040 --> 33:44.480
It's, it's, and I, oh, I, I, I, well, I believe is something I do before I do nothing that

33:44.480 --> 33:49.960
thank you, that is, look, I'm not, if you're watching or listening, I'm not, I'm not preaching

33:49.960 --> 33:50.960
to you.

33:50.960 --> 33:51.960
You're different than me.

33:51.960 --> 34:01.400
I think that like, like, we have to, if you're listening to me, like, like start, like, nothing

34:01.400 --> 34:02.880
bad can happen to you.

34:02.880 --> 34:06.160
I am not going to be taken up to an electric chair at a mountain tomorrow.

34:06.160 --> 34:09.560
I'm not going to be exposed in a Mel Gibsonian way.

34:09.560 --> 34:15.720
I am, I am however, confessing to you that like, like something that is fundamental to

34:15.720 --> 34:22.880
all of this, that like the, the more innocent you are of any crime at all, the more important

34:22.880 --> 34:27.040
it is that you have this conversation with yourself, right?

34:27.040 --> 34:32.680
You know, this week, like, like, because I'm saying that to, and I'm saying that to you

34:32.680 --> 34:37.600
in the same way I would say, cut out carbs or fucking like, drink less or something like

34:37.600 --> 34:45.240
that I had discovered, like, like, I think this is the time and it is not because I know

34:45.240 --> 34:46.440
better than you.

34:46.440 --> 34:54.160
It is because I, like, I'm going like, shit, you guys, like, like, like, we, we, we have

34:54.160 --> 34:59.760
the capacity to do things that we don't know we're doing and, and we, like, we are going

34:59.760 --> 35:04.240
to benefit as brothers, we're not going to be less masculine and we're not going to be

35:04.240 --> 35:07.600
less cool and we're not going to make less of a paycheck.

35:07.600 --> 35:14.040
Like there will be no real world consequences, even amongst each other, if we, if we push

35:14.040 --> 35:22.280
toward it being fashionable to not create a divider in between the conversations that

35:22.280 --> 35:26.040
we have with ourselves, each other and, and with women.

35:26.040 --> 35:29.720
It's been nice, like, this summer camp thing for me for a while, like, there's a lake in

35:29.720 --> 35:34.920
between the boys camp and the girls camp and it's very fun, the idea, like, and with that

35:34.920 --> 35:41.960
comes panty raids and, which is awful, which is terrible.

35:41.960 --> 35:46.280
All of the shit from our 80s movies, it's all awful, it's fun for the guys, but it's

35:46.280 --> 35:52.000
like you've just broken into our place and started going through our personal items and

35:52.000 --> 35:58.760
taking them away from us and, and we don't, we can't do anything about it.

35:58.760 --> 36:02.360
But here's the logic circuit that gets triggered in you when we, when we talk about this stuff,

36:02.360 --> 36:05.080
because I know it gets triggered in me.

36:05.080 --> 36:07.800
It's like, oh, what are you suggesting?

36:07.800 --> 36:09.040
What are you proposing?

36:09.040 --> 36:10.360
What are we supposed to do?

36:10.360 --> 36:14.520
So I'm supposed to do this, but if we do that, but if everyone does this, but what about

36:14.520 --> 36:15.520
that?

36:15.520 --> 36:16.520
Stop.

36:16.520 --> 36:22.600
Like it is not, there is no invitation here and no command and no lecture.

36:22.600 --> 36:23.920
It is a tag cloud.

36:23.920 --> 36:29.000
It is tagging something and becoming more aware of it, making it more organisable.

36:29.000 --> 36:36.880
I myself, Dan Harmon, with no expectation of anyone else and no prediction of, of what

36:36.880 --> 36:37.880
will happen.

36:37.880 --> 36:44.760
And with no observation about how society works, I am saying, and I feel like from my

36:44.760 --> 36:51.200
pull of one here with my best friend that we're all in it right now.

36:51.200 --> 36:55.960
Like I am saying, as one of you having that conversation in his head, like, like all we

36:55.960 --> 37:07.120
have to do first is, is, is go back over our whole fucking life and, and, and you never

37:07.120 --> 37:08.680
have to put it in a journal.

37:08.680 --> 37:11.000
You don't have to issue a press release.

37:11.000 --> 37:13.560
You don't have to call anybody and say you're sorry.

37:13.560 --> 37:20.040
You do just, but you, there will be no, you can, you can welch on this after you agree

37:20.040 --> 37:21.040
to do it.

37:21.040 --> 37:22.040
Just open your panel.

37:22.040 --> 37:28.520
If you're over 30, go back, go back to like 10 or eight and just kind of just, just, you

37:28.520 --> 37:29.680
don't, you don't have to do that.

37:29.680 --> 37:30.680
You're not combing a beach.

37:30.680 --> 37:33.680
You know that these fucking moments have charged to them.

37:33.680 --> 37:38.320
Your moments with women, your relationships, the moment of your conquest, the moment of

37:38.320 --> 37:43.200
your defeat, the moment of when you realize so and so was a bitch, the moment you realize

37:43.200 --> 37:48.240
that you didn't want this, but you prefer that and you're kind of into that.

37:48.240 --> 37:52.000
Any, any moments that are charged with sexuality, just pop back over to them.

37:52.000 --> 37:54.960
They're like marked on your little sci-fi map.

37:54.960 --> 37:59.760
They're marked with fucking, they're marked and go back to them and just, and just, and

37:59.760 --> 38:04.760
just relive them and, and, and, and say, oh, oh man.

38:04.760 --> 38:13.080
If I did that right now in front of me, I would say to me, okay, hey, here, listen,

38:13.080 --> 38:14.080
that's not fair.

38:14.080 --> 38:15.080
Yeah.

38:15.080 --> 38:16.080
Or whatever you'd say.

38:16.080 --> 38:18.680
Like, here's what, here's what your current me shouldn't be saying.

38:18.680 --> 38:19.680
You piece of shit.

38:19.680 --> 38:20.880
You fucking jerk off.

38:20.880 --> 38:21.880
You don't know the rules.

38:21.880 --> 38:22.880
You piece of shit.

38:22.880 --> 38:23.880
Fuck you.

38:23.880 --> 38:26.280
Don't, don't you know fucking chicks like it this way now?

38:26.280 --> 38:27.800
Like that guy's not a hero.

38:27.800 --> 38:31.600
Like I'm saying your real self that's like, ooh, fuck, I didn't know.

38:31.600 --> 38:33.000
I didn't know.

38:33.000 --> 38:34.400
I was, I didn't know.

38:34.400 --> 38:35.400
I wouldn't know what I was doing.

38:35.400 --> 38:40.360
And it's embarrassing because you look at it and you go, how could I not know?

38:40.360 --> 38:43.640
How could you not know that that was wrong?

38:43.640 --> 38:48.640
It's just, you know, it's, it's, it's very similar to what I went through with just

38:48.640 --> 38:51.560
stop eating meat, you know, the click in your head of, what am I doing?

38:51.560 --> 38:52.560
Yeah.

38:52.560 --> 38:53.560
Even just, what am I doing?

38:53.560 --> 38:57.360
Like, not to gain say you, like, like, like, forget about the word wrong, because then

38:57.360 --> 39:00.240
it like creates this dichotomy of like, there's a perfect way to be.

39:00.240 --> 39:05.120
I'm saying that that's like, it's like, what, what, with your meat eating, you're not running

39:05.120 --> 39:08.120
around telling everybody not to eat meat, but it's hard to.

39:08.120 --> 39:09.120
But I want to.

39:09.120 --> 39:13.840
Well, but, but you're lived by example and you express yourself and you go like, I didn't

39:13.840 --> 39:15.240
eat meat today, whatever the fuck.

39:15.240 --> 39:18.440
You don't like run around and hit people on the head with a brick.

39:18.440 --> 39:21.520
I'm just saying that's not my point at all.

39:21.520 --> 39:22.520
I know, I know.

39:22.520 --> 39:24.680
You can be evangelical about you're not eating meat.

39:24.680 --> 39:25.680
It's okay.

39:25.680 --> 39:26.680
It's okay.

39:26.680 --> 39:27.680
It's fine.

39:27.680 --> 39:28.680
Like.

39:28.680 --> 39:31.960
Awareness, that's where I'm starting.

39:31.960 --> 39:32.960
Yeah.

39:32.960 --> 39:33.960
I'm embarrassed.

39:33.960 --> 39:34.960
I'm 44.

39:34.960 --> 39:42.560
I spent a really long time thinking about women as being a huge portion of that time has been

39:42.560 --> 39:52.160
my feminist phase, which just means that I've recognized that there's a different protocol.

39:52.160 --> 39:57.800
Like, but the entire time was like, there's a division.

39:57.800 --> 40:00.800
Sometimes it's a, it's a wall over which I'm handing care packages.

40:00.800 --> 40:04.880
Sometimes it's a wall over, you know, back in my twenties, I'm lobbying like M eighties

40:04.880 --> 40:07.880
over it and dead frogs to get a scream.

40:07.880 --> 40:12.040
Um, then, then it's like, I'm drilling a hole in it because I'm a hero.

40:12.040 --> 40:13.960
This wall should come down.

40:13.960 --> 40:16.800
I don't like, there's a wall there.

40:16.800 --> 40:20.440
Like I, I, I, it has been there forever.

40:20.440 --> 40:24.160
Like, and it, it's like, I'm sorry about that.

40:24.160 --> 40:34.400
I feel remorse for that and I'm like, I'm trying to like, uh, like, like, notice when

40:34.400 --> 40:41.680
I like, when I'm saying shit because it's the easy thing to say and when, and when,

40:41.680 --> 40:44.960
and when, because it's the next thing that you should say and when, and when it's the

40:44.960 --> 40:50.480
next thing that you should say in order to keep your job or make yourself more comfortable

40:50.480 --> 40:57.080
or feel good or all this stuff, like it's, it's, it's, it's, it's time to just sort

40:57.080 --> 41:01.920
of start thinking ergonomically about that stuff and, and, and you guys that are 25,

41:01.920 --> 41:04.320
like, okay, Spencer and Levy are sitting here.

41:04.320 --> 41:12.120
Let's, let's, let's, let's, okay, okay, 32 is the new 25, uh, the, the, how old are

41:12.120 --> 41:13.120
you guys?

41:13.120 --> 41:14.120
What are you?

41:14.120 --> 41:15.120
28, 28.

41:15.120 --> 41:16.120
All right.

41:16.120 --> 41:20.200
Now, now, now tell us everything, all right.

41:20.200 --> 41:21.720
It turns out women are people.

41:21.720 --> 41:22.720
Yeah.

41:22.720 --> 41:23.720
See.

41:23.720 --> 41:24.720
No, I don't know.

41:24.720 --> 41:26.720
I'm roadie, smug, millennial.

41:26.720 --> 41:28.720
That was a, that was a way you wanted.

41:28.720 --> 41:30.320
It was a simple, sucky up kind of.

41:30.320 --> 41:34.920
I wanted you to talk for 40 minutes or like a, I mean, I guess when I have these conversations

41:34.920 --> 41:40.400
with friends, it's always, it always comes back to just socialization and, you know,

41:40.400 --> 41:44.920
through the, through the decades, the American way was like women's stay in the kitchen and

41:44.920 --> 41:45.920
they raise the kids.

41:45.920 --> 41:46.920
They're pets.

41:46.920 --> 41:49.680
I mean, essentially, I guess, I mean, that's what it is.

41:49.680 --> 41:50.680
Yeah.

41:50.680 --> 41:51.680
Companion.

41:51.680 --> 41:52.680
People.

41:52.680 --> 41:53.680
Yeah.

41:53.680 --> 41:54.680
And then.

41:54.680 --> 41:55.680
But that's not how anybody in this room or anybody that we've talked to has ever, say

41:55.680 --> 41:58.280
it's easy to go like the idea that women should stay in the kitchen.

41:58.280 --> 41:59.280
No, no, no, no.

41:59.280 --> 42:00.840
No, that's, that's our parents.

42:00.840 --> 42:01.840
Right.

42:01.840 --> 42:06.560
But like, let's take my like conservative grandmother, for instance, like, she's cool

42:06.560 --> 42:16.880
with like everyone getting work and whatever, but what's her name, Judy, Judy, Judy, Judy

42:16.880 --> 42:20.360
Levy, no, Levy, LeBetsky, LeBetsky.

42:20.360 --> 42:21.360
I'm not calling her out.

42:21.360 --> 42:24.840
I mean, she's just, she grew up in a, Oh, sorry, you probably didn't want to mention

42:24.840 --> 42:25.840
her name.

42:25.840 --> 42:26.840
Right.

42:26.840 --> 42:31.640
And she grew up in a time where like, you know, there was a certain expectation and,

42:31.640 --> 42:36.680
you know, like, I think my grandfather said this weekend, like women went to college just

42:36.680 --> 42:38.080
to get married.

42:38.080 --> 42:39.360
And she was like, that's not true.

42:39.360 --> 42:41.080
I got a really great education.

42:41.080 --> 42:49.040
It just so happens that was a place that most women met men and got married and then ultimately

42:49.040 --> 42:50.720
didn't pursue work.

42:50.720 --> 42:55.640
But just the idea that like my grandfather in his head is like, yeah, well, women just,

42:55.640 --> 42:57.640
that's the only reason they were going to college.

42:57.640 --> 42:58.640
I don't know.

42:58.640 --> 43:03.160
It's just, I feel like those conversations, I like those are then, then we're in this

43:03.160 --> 43:06.960
ditch of like unsolvability and all this stuff.

43:06.960 --> 43:10.400
No, I think what you're saying, I mean, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not pooping on what you're

43:10.400 --> 43:11.400
expressing.

43:11.400 --> 43:14.600
I'm like, I'm yes, and again, going again, yeah, this is the thing that like distracts

43:14.600 --> 43:21.520
us is the, is the conversations about how society works like in a nuts and bolts way.

43:21.520 --> 43:28.240
Like how far are you into a conversation about being conscious of other people before it

43:28.240 --> 43:31.840
immediately gets like, it's like two, two sentences before you're talking about who

43:31.840 --> 43:37.160
opens the car door and who pays for the, for dinner and minimum wage and, and all the stuff

43:37.160 --> 43:41.440
which actually like ties everything in a giant knot and you can't move forward.

43:41.440 --> 43:44.360
But it's, it's all about progress.

43:44.360 --> 43:49.480
And I think that this particular type of conversation changes, it changes that conversation.

43:49.480 --> 43:56.200
And, and like, you know, this is such a trying time that I think that it's hurting certain

43:56.200 --> 43:57.200
areas.

43:57.200 --> 44:02.520
And I think that, you know, hopefully this, we move forward and it's, and, and things

44:02.520 --> 44:03.520
start to get better.

44:03.520 --> 44:07.200
Like uncomfortable people avoid it and they go, I don't want to hear it.

44:07.200 --> 44:08.200
It's fine.

44:08.200 --> 44:09.200
The way it is.

44:09.200 --> 44:10.200
It's because nobody wants to be wrong.

44:10.200 --> 44:11.200
Yeah.

44:11.200 --> 44:12.200
I'm wrong about everything.

44:12.200 --> 44:13.200
I'm wrong about everything.

44:13.200 --> 44:14.200
I've been wrong about everything my whole life.

44:14.200 --> 44:15.200
Oh God.

44:15.200 --> 44:16.200
Oh God, you're wrong.

44:16.200 --> 44:17.200
Did you hear, did you hear what he said?

44:17.200 --> 44:18.200
He said he was wrong.

44:18.200 --> 44:19.200
You're wrong.

44:19.200 --> 44:20.200
You're wrong.

44:20.200 --> 44:21.200
You got this wrong.

44:21.200 --> 44:22.200
You use the wrong word.

44:22.200 --> 44:23.200
You use the wrong thing.

44:23.200 --> 44:24.200
And like that's the other thing that we're like sick of hearing about how we forgot the

44:24.200 --> 44:25.200
rust belt.

44:25.200 --> 44:27.400
And that's like, now we have a Nazi in the White House because apparently some fucking redneck

44:27.400 --> 44:29.960
somewhere got tired of being ignored.

44:29.960 --> 44:30.960
Everything we do is wrong.

44:30.960 --> 44:34.240
We're wrong if we're being right too much, we're wrong.

44:34.240 --> 44:40.160
But like, we're all, yeah, I just like fucking like, I'm 44 and I'm like, I'm wrong about

44:40.160 --> 44:41.160
everything.

44:41.160 --> 44:42.160
I'm always wrong.

44:42.160 --> 44:45.880
And it's like, like, isn't that a good, like if you woke up and said, like, I'm wrong.

44:45.880 --> 44:47.240
I'm going to be wrong today.

44:47.240 --> 44:49.080
I'm still, I was wrong yesterday.

44:49.080 --> 44:51.160
I'm going to be wrong more today.

44:51.160 --> 45:00.240
And like, like, and I, why is it that when a woman comes into my wrongness and says,

45:00.240 --> 45:05.120
like, maybe this, and that's like, I have an increased tendency to go like, well, I don't

45:05.120 --> 45:07.240
know about that, but I'm just saying I'm wrong.

45:07.240 --> 45:14.160
Like I have fucking issues and I have like, like shit that I need to like, like grease

45:14.160 --> 45:16.120
and loosen and pull apart.

45:16.120 --> 45:18.240
Do you want to ask a woman?

45:18.240 --> 45:19.240
Ask a woman.

45:19.240 --> 45:20.240
I don't want to ask a woman anything.

45:20.240 --> 45:24.600
No, I think that there's like, you know, the hippie counterculture introduced this concept

45:24.600 --> 45:29.520
where like, no one that anyone says is true and anyone that anyone tells you is the establishment

45:29.520 --> 45:32.840
trying to force a new hegemony on you.

45:32.840 --> 45:38.240
And that opened the door for basically saying that anything that science, anything that anyone

45:38.240 --> 45:43.480
has told you as fact is biased and is trying to sell you something, which kind of open

45:43.480 --> 45:49.720
up the door for what we understand to be hippie stuff, you know, yoga, meditation, crystals,

45:49.720 --> 45:55.120
sex cults, like all this stuff kind of grew out of alternative, non scientific ways of

45:55.120 --> 46:00.280
trying to understand the world, and it kind of gained steam and power and became this

46:00.280 --> 46:06.080
countercultural thing and that grew into like, there's bodies of facts to support any position

46:06.080 --> 46:11.480
and there's a book on this and a book on ghosts and then it kind of gives the idea that completely

46:11.480 --> 46:16.600
non scientific kind of non intellectual things can have the auspices of intellectuality and

46:16.600 --> 46:20.600
kind of the responsible credibility of something that's real.

46:20.600 --> 46:25.360
And that kind of created a world where people can feel comfortable just being right all

46:25.360 --> 46:29.600
the time and creating new systems that create ways for that they're right.

46:29.600 --> 46:33.480
And so everyone's kind of ensconced themselves in these silos of thinking that have kind

46:33.480 --> 46:37.520
of just existed concurrently and not ever butted into each other.

46:37.520 --> 46:41.960
And that the feel, well, because the feeling of being wrong means that you can't charge

46:41.960 --> 46:44.960
for charge anyone money to be wrong, right?

46:44.960 --> 46:47.480
You can charge somebody money to be right.

46:47.480 --> 46:49.680
And I think it's American to you.

46:49.680 --> 46:53.440
You go like it's like there's no reward for saying, I don't know.

46:53.440 --> 46:54.440
I don't know.

46:54.440 --> 46:57.160
I think I got that wrong.

46:57.160 --> 46:58.160
I don't know.

46:58.160 --> 46:59.160
Yeah.

46:59.160 --> 47:01.640
I think in like the Middle East, people will get a lot more mad and get into arguments

47:01.640 --> 47:04.640
and in other countries, people will be more comfortable with stuff like that.

47:04.640 --> 47:09.480
But I think specifically in America, we have this discomfort with with really budding up

47:09.480 --> 47:13.840
against people and having these outward political debates, I mean, until very recently because

47:13.840 --> 47:14.840
it's kind of exploded.

47:14.840 --> 47:15.840
Yeah.

47:15.840 --> 47:23.160
And that's what feels like it's like there's always like, yeah, man, like it's my nightmare

47:23.160 --> 47:26.680
to be stupid and to be wrong and to be talking out of my ass and all this stuff.

47:26.680 --> 47:29.680
Like I want to go back and I want to start this podcast over again.

47:29.680 --> 47:31.920
I was a fucking babbling idiot.

47:31.920 --> 47:34.840
You don't want to have listened to it.

47:34.840 --> 47:41.720
I'll try better next week, but like if I'm already wrong, I'm wrong.

47:41.720 --> 47:42.920
So then what do you do?

47:42.920 --> 47:46.840
Like you like, so my therapist is saying like, it's time.

47:46.840 --> 47:49.280
Did I explain this?

47:49.280 --> 47:53.840
I'm not making any sense like where it's like, here's how I perceive the world working when

47:53.840 --> 47:57.280
a human being like walks around and okay, so I'm going to walk.

47:57.280 --> 47:59.200
I'm going to see a, all right.

47:59.200 --> 48:00.680
So say something to me.

48:00.680 --> 48:01.680
Hi there, sir.

48:01.680 --> 48:02.680
How are you doing?

48:02.680 --> 48:03.680
Okay.

48:03.680 --> 48:04.680
So I just heard the words.

48:04.680 --> 48:05.680
Hi there, sir.

48:05.680 --> 48:06.680
How are you doing?

48:06.680 --> 48:07.680
There's a guy in the sidewalk.

48:07.680 --> 48:14.560
That those facts went into my head and now I envision them as going down a pipe through

48:14.560 --> 48:20.680
my face, down my neck, and then at my chest level, above my solar plexus, but right at

48:20.680 --> 48:28.000
the top, right between my neck and like right between my nipples, there's a box.

48:28.000 --> 48:33.320
It's a square box that all the information from my ears and eyes goes into.

48:33.320 --> 48:36.440
This is the first stop that it goes into.

48:36.440 --> 48:45.680
And it's like, it's, I don't, I'm scared to call it society or, it's just like, it's

48:45.680 --> 48:46.680
Freudian terms.

48:46.680 --> 48:53.760
I think maybe it's experience, the supernatural, let's just call it nurture versus nature,

48:53.760 --> 48:57.400
but that's distracting too, but it's like.

48:57.400 --> 48:58.400
It's a construct.

48:58.400 --> 49:02.640
Yeah, it's norms, norms, socialization.

49:02.640 --> 49:09.040
It's stored processing, a programming that you have assembled because there probably

49:09.040 --> 49:13.440
is on some psychological level, the equivalent of a metabolism and it probably saves time

49:13.440 --> 49:17.480
to not have to think about a bunch of shit implicit bias to not have to learn to tie

49:17.480 --> 49:25.080
your shoes every morning to not have to wonder what a wood is and realize that it used to

49:25.080 --> 49:28.120
be trees, but so you can continue making your deck.

49:28.120 --> 49:29.120
You have to go.

49:29.120 --> 49:30.120
I guess I'm making it now.

49:30.120 --> 49:35.840
That sounds like amnesia, but anyways, it's the shit that you've, you've, you've accepted

49:35.840 --> 49:36.840
as fact.

49:36.840 --> 49:37.840
Right.

49:37.840 --> 49:43.960
Um, and like, we are so advanced now that that information, if you're living in a city

49:43.960 --> 49:50.360
and someone comes up to you and says what Rob just said, hello, uh, it goes into a box

49:50.360 --> 49:56.000
and like, of course there's a hello back, like that's like the first thing in there.

49:56.000 --> 50:00.560
There's, there's a million things based on whatever you're perceiving.

50:00.560 --> 50:07.320
Most importantly, it never, I feel like I have arranged in my body, that box is above

50:07.320 --> 50:14.200
another optional box, which has to do with me, like learning shit, where I am like vulnerable,

50:14.200 --> 50:21.000
where I am wondering what's going on the baby, the guy that's like, well, I don't know.

50:21.000 --> 50:22.880
So let's find out what the fuck is that?

50:22.880 --> 50:23.880
What's going on?

50:23.880 --> 50:34.560
And we have like, I, I, I am using my I statements, uh, like I have such a hard time getting to

50:34.560 --> 50:35.560
that person.

50:35.560 --> 50:42.760
Like, like the shoebox of, of fucking options up here is so like, there's getting to the

50:42.760 --> 50:45.000
person that said, Hey, how are you doing today?

50:45.000 --> 50:51.760
It could be a headline, it could be a headline about a 78 people getting shot in a mass shooting.

50:51.760 --> 50:56.720
It could be a, um, my friend saying, um, I've just turned vegan and I don't want to eat

50:56.720 --> 50:57.720
meat anymore.

50:57.720 --> 50:59.120
Yeah, it's, it's cruel.

50:59.120 --> 51:00.920
It could be someone saying, I'm Muslim.

51:00.920 --> 51:05.440
It could be someone saying, uh, your friend Glenn just sexually harassed me at the carnival

51:05.440 --> 51:08.280
last night and you're still friends with him and it hurts my feelings.

51:08.280 --> 51:10.880
It could be, um, did you watch big bang theory?

51:10.880 --> 51:14.800
It could be, um, uh, here's how you install a backsplash for your sink.

51:14.800 --> 51:19.360
Any information that comes into you, like everything, all of your experience, I'm just

51:19.360 --> 51:25.720
saying, I, I, I like, I think there are two boxes.

51:25.720 --> 51:27.600
I think I'm an unconscious person.

51:27.600 --> 51:32.320
Well, I think that that second box is like, maybe like core values and beliefs and stuff

51:32.320 --> 51:38.080
that kind of form, I don't know, like our religiosity, our, uh, you know, uh, attitudes

51:38.080 --> 51:42.360
towards authority and like that really forms our core identity, but that is definitely

51:42.360 --> 51:45.800
part of knowing traffic laws and piracy laws and stuff.

51:45.800 --> 51:50.400
And it's like, it is, that stuff is important, but that stuff isn't who we truly are.

51:50.400 --> 51:55.520
So like, I definitely think there are these two, two kinds of things that we, and one

51:55.520 --> 51:57.200
of them is mostly unconscious.

51:57.200 --> 52:01.640
I think we had that one neuro Scientologist lady on and she was talking about implicit

52:01.640 --> 52:06.880
bias, but I think that that like bias comes a lot from these, these core values that just

52:06.880 --> 52:12.360
form our base identity and our kind of like world or like, like perspective, just when

52:12.360 --> 52:15.120
we are growing up, you know, our privilege and stuff.

52:15.120 --> 52:19.760
Like that's all just formed from these core truths that we understand that come from privilege

52:19.760 --> 52:23.320
because the core truths of like a white male are going to be way different than the core

52:23.320 --> 52:27.640
truths from like a black, you know, girl growing up in a, in a neighborhood with, you

52:27.640 --> 52:29.800
know, police presence all the time.

52:29.800 --> 52:33.400
So it just kind of, it kind of, but there, you can change them.

52:33.400 --> 52:38.000
I think it's just a lot harder because they are these core values that we recognize are

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
important to our sense of identity.

52:40.000 --> 52:44.240
And I think we're in a world that like figuring out our identity and what side we're on and

52:44.240 --> 52:49.080
whether we're cool with that or whatever is becoming something that maybe media or culture

52:49.080 --> 52:54.080
is kind of hyper, uh, hyper rising, like kind of whipping into a froth weaponizing probably

52:54.080 --> 52:58.800
for marketing purposes, but it's like becoming more of a thing where you have to pick a site.

52:58.800 --> 53:02.560
Whereas I don't think you, you used to, you used to be able to like, Oh, well, how about

53:02.560 --> 53:03.560
that?

53:03.560 --> 53:04.560
Did you hear about that?

53:04.560 --> 53:05.560
Wow.

53:05.560 --> 53:07.200
You know, and now it's like, I'm okay with that.

53:07.200 --> 53:09.040
I'm not going to be okay with that.

53:09.040 --> 53:10.480
Should I be okay with that?

53:10.480 --> 53:14.040
I think I'm okay with that unless someone has any reason why I shouldn't be.

53:14.040 --> 53:15.040
And I don't know.

53:15.040 --> 53:17.920
I think it just is like, we're more primed to either accept or reject things.

53:17.920 --> 53:20.760
I think, I think, but the thing, the thing that I think is real interesting about this

53:20.760 --> 53:26.240
conversation is like traditionally, uh, you know, the older you get, the more you get

53:26.240 --> 53:32.440
set in your ways and you know, there's a hundred standup references to like the, the

53:32.440 --> 53:38.440
four words that you get from your, your uncle or, or, or your, your parents saying all this

53:38.440 --> 53:40.520
racist stuff or what a class of stuff.

53:40.520 --> 53:44.320
Like it's just because that's how they were raised and they're not learning, but what

53:44.320 --> 53:48.360
you're going through Dan and what, what I'm going through and what it seems like the world

53:48.360 --> 53:53.080
our generation is going through is we're kind of looking to back and going, we were wrong

53:53.080 --> 53:54.080
back.

53:54.080 --> 53:57.080
I know you don't want to say wrong with the C on the way I can explain it, but I was like,

53:57.080 --> 54:02.160
I look back and I go, yeah, there was a time where I was like, no, women are the enemy

54:02.160 --> 54:03.920
and they deserve it.

54:03.920 --> 54:10.280
And I'm going to be on the guy side because women judge me and say yes or no to me and

54:10.280 --> 54:12.800
anybody in a position of power is got to be evil.

54:12.800 --> 54:20.080
So they deserve whatever and I've thought that way most of my life because I'm the,

54:20.080 --> 54:21.080
I'm the underdog.

54:21.080 --> 54:24.200
I don't deserve this and why can't it be easier for me?

54:24.200 --> 54:27.080
And that's my fault and it's shitty.

54:27.080 --> 54:30.880
And I, and I, yeah, because how many ways did you fucking bother to second guess the

54:30.880 --> 54:31.880
system?

54:31.880 --> 54:32.880
Yeah.

54:32.880 --> 54:35.880
You know, when they told you not to cut school, when they told you not to be as into Jackie

54:35.880 --> 54:40.240
Chan bootleg videos, when they told you Dungeons and Dragons wasn't cool, when they,

54:40.240 --> 54:41.680
you know, it's like, we're so fucking late.

54:41.680 --> 54:45.800
It's like you pick and choose which, which area of being a hero, which feels right.

54:45.800 --> 54:49.400
And sometimes when it feels right, it's just avoiding the truth.

54:49.400 --> 54:53.320
But the other side of that is like, as soon as I start saying that, I know cause it's

54:53.320 --> 54:56.040
like, then you start going, what, wait, what are you saying?

54:56.040 --> 54:58.840
Like who do you don't owe anybody anything?

54:58.840 --> 55:00.840
You don't, you don't, no one's going to take your pants.

55:00.840 --> 55:02.640
You know, they're not going to lose any trail mix.

55:02.640 --> 55:05.360
There's not going to be any less teeth under your pillow tomorrow.

55:05.360 --> 55:09.080
I, that's where I, that's how we're used to processing things.

55:09.080 --> 55:11.680
Like someone's coming for my fucking shit.

55:11.680 --> 55:17.840
So if you, if you let that guy spit on you at recess tomorrow, um, you know, he, and

55:17.840 --> 55:22.360
you don't do something about it, like he's going to spit on you twice as much as he spits

55:22.360 --> 55:26.720
on, uh, Toby Richards, because Toby Richards, you know what he did, he fucking kicked him

55:26.720 --> 55:27.720
in the nuts.

55:27.720 --> 55:29.200
He still got his ass kicked, but he didn't get spit on it anymore.

55:29.200 --> 55:34.200
And like logic, logic, logic, logic, logic, slippery slope, hierarchy, logic, logic, logic.

55:34.200 --> 55:37.000
Uh, Dan, when did your podcast stop being funny?

55:37.000 --> 55:42.800
When your mama fucking slurped on my giant knob, uh, I, I, I already warned you about

55:42.800 --> 55:43.800
this.

55:43.800 --> 55:44.800
Okay.

55:44.800 --> 55:45.800
I just want to address that one more time.

55:45.800 --> 55:46.800
Voice in my head.

55:46.800 --> 55:47.800
I'm just saying, I understand.

55:47.800 --> 55:52.680
I, I, I spent the weekend inadvertently going through YouTube clips of like when my podcast

55:52.680 --> 55:53.680
is really funny.

55:53.680 --> 55:55.520
A lot of times Rob's on when that's happening.

55:55.520 --> 55:56.520
That's true.

55:56.520 --> 55:58.360
Um, so I thought I'd invite him back tonight.

55:58.360 --> 56:02.840
Boy, I'm really, really doing that.

56:02.840 --> 56:09.760
I don't, I don't, I don't, all I can tell you is like, like, like, I'll be, the funny,

56:09.760 --> 56:10.760
the funny is happening.

56:10.760 --> 56:15.200
It doesn't have to be funny when I'm, when I'm not losing my mind and we're not losing

56:15.200 --> 56:18.320
our mind when, when there's not shit going on, it's just like, you know, we just mark

56:18.320 --> 56:19.320
these occasions.

56:19.320 --> 56:20.320
You, you click on this one.

56:20.320 --> 56:25.920
You go, oh, that must have been when, uh, the Ros, Ros McGowan was doing that thing

56:25.920 --> 56:26.920
on the, on the Twitter.

56:26.920 --> 56:31.760
Um, but anyways, I do remember when those aliens were found at Ros McGowan.

56:31.760 --> 56:38.760
I want to, I want, I can't, I want to say one thing about, about, about Rose, aka Joan

56:38.760 --> 56:45.680
of Arc right now, because there's this awesome thing happening, which, uh, like Twitter was

56:45.680 --> 56:51.800
used to get a, a president elected in a way that really bummed us out because leading

56:51.800 --> 56:56.160
up to that, the accepted thing was that Twitter couldn't accomplish anything real.

56:56.160 --> 56:57.160
That was worth any change.

56:57.160 --> 57:03.280
And for it to get like hacked, whether you use that term like literally or not, but like

57:03.280 --> 57:09.160
for it to be, I, it's unfairly or not for it to be used as a real world tool to just

57:09.160 --> 57:15.680
affect real change for the bad guys was like really demoralizing, especially for people

57:15.680 --> 57:18.560
like me who grew up on the internet.

57:18.560 --> 57:24.720
We thought we created as a place to hide from really awful people, asterisk per our other

57:24.720 --> 57:27.760
conversation, we're finding out that that entire time we were also awful people because

57:27.760 --> 57:30.960
we fantasized about being Han Solo who was a piece of shit to live in.

57:30.960 --> 57:31.960
All right.

57:31.960 --> 57:38.600
But the, but then this is why even though it's like a kind of like nice book end to

57:38.600 --> 57:43.200
this thing, because now we're, this is the, this is the second time since the election

57:43.200 --> 57:50.040
of that parasite that what's happening on Twitter, as soon as I mentioned it to my therapist,

57:50.040 --> 57:53.480
she knows what I'm talking about and shit's happening.

57:53.480 --> 57:58.320
There's a court of public opinion that got leveraged on Twitter that was used to create

57:58.320 --> 58:04.200
real world results that like heads rolled down the physical street with the potatoes.

58:04.200 --> 58:09.720
It wasn't like cancel Colbert, nothing happens because first of all, what are you doing second

58:09.720 --> 58:11.680
of all, blah, blah, blah.

58:11.680 --> 58:17.440
The world just continuing to like circulate while Twitter acts like there's something

58:17.440 --> 58:19.080
that can be done.

58:19.080 --> 58:25.200
It was like, this feels like exhilarating, but the funny thing about it is that it feels

58:25.200 --> 58:29.200
exhilarating in a way that feels like the fire is outside my front porch.

58:29.200 --> 58:33.000
Did, did, did she get, was there a Twitter account?

58:33.000 --> 58:35.720
Like, is it like she got suspended because she, but is it back?

58:35.720 --> 58:38.000
I mean, I, I assume, I assume it's back.

58:38.000 --> 58:39.000
Yeah.

58:39.000 --> 58:40.000
Yeah.

58:40.000 --> 58:41.000
I haven't read it.

58:41.000 --> 58:42.000
I haven't read it.

58:42.000 --> 58:44.160
The last thing I heard while this is actually why I wanted to bring it up.

58:44.160 --> 58:47.680
It's an anecdotal thing that made me want to just say one thing as long as I'm not being

58:47.680 --> 58:53.080
funny, like to the extreme, like there was a recent thing that just happened that I was

58:53.080 --> 58:57.440
hearing about like the, while getting ready to take my girlfriend's day at the dinner,

58:57.440 --> 59:05.520
which was like, uh, um, she said something that it crossed a racial line and she was

59:05.520 --> 59:08.360
trying to reach for an allegory to help whatever.

59:08.360 --> 59:14.800
And then there was flash, blowback flashback, the whiteback, black, black, like black flashback

59:14.800 --> 59:20.040
of the, of the clack, like, like, like it exploded and it got all fucked up.

59:20.040 --> 59:24.720
And I, and I, like halfway through hearing about it, I just wanted to like, like, I was

59:24.720 --> 59:29.320
like, are we, are we like, isn't this what we've been doing for like 15 years?

59:29.320 --> 59:33.080
Like, like we keep on like, like a cool shit starts happening.

59:33.080 --> 59:38.360
And then like the bad guys don't, they don't have this, they don't have this obstacle in

59:38.360 --> 59:45.240
their path where everything, like, like, where, like we, we hold, we hold our, our, our people

59:45.240 --> 59:50.040
who are, who are helping us, like, and making us have conversations, like we hold them to

59:50.040 --> 59:57.000
the, to the standard of, as if they're supposed to like, be some kind of like historical figure

59:57.000 --> 01:00:02.480
that gets everything right or, and then to the extent that any, our standard for ignoring

01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:09.240
leaders has become, oh, did we then find out they're not perfect?

01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:15.160
Meanwhile, the bad guys, they, they're just beating us because they don't have that standard.

01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:16.160
They don't care.

01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:20.880
You can be a Republican that does not believe at all in Mexicans being rapists and just wants

01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:25.480
to gain financially and you can, you can belong to a party where you go like, yeah, but I

01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:28.640
don't, I don't, I don't care that he said that.

01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:29.640
Who gives a shit?

01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:34.280
I want my money and I'm going to get my money by pretending I don't give a shit what he

01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:35.280
says.

01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:41.360
And the good guys are like, fuckin' A, yes, down with the patriarchy, like, let's do this

01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:47.160
one thing and then, and then we, we have that hero worship thing.

01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:53.880
It's like, can't you just, can't you, can't you give a woman that stands up for a second

01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:54.880
of fuckin' break?

01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:56.280
I, I, like, like, they're not-

01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:58.080
It happens so quickly, too.

01:00:58.080 --> 01:00:59.240
It's always, it's gonna happen.

01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:00.800
It's always gonna happen quickly.

01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:05.440
It's like, like, there's always gonna be Tinder and fuckin' like, not the app, the actual

01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:07.120
thing that we use to start fires.

01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:11.320
There's always gonna be a, there's always gonna be, it's, she wasn't running for senator.

01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:16.440
Like, like, like, Emily Gordon, like, retweeted a link to a thing and I don't know who wrote

01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:17.440
it.

01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:23.720
I only, like, I, like, it was years ago and the, the article's headline was, admit it,

01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:28.120
your fave is problematic, which, and I was like, what is that, gibberish?

01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:35.240
I read the articles, like, saying, if you keep holding your, the people you admire to,

01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:44.960
to, to, to a standard of political, minute to minute, like, perfection, like, then you're,

01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:45.960
you're fucking them.

01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:50.640
I mean, it's, it's, the, the FBI monitored Martin Luther King to make sure, this is like,

01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:55.520
they were like, oh man, the minute that guy gets a blow job, then, like, then we don't

01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:57.280
have to care about black people anymore.

01:01:57.280 --> 01:01:58.280
Is that fair?

01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:03.640
That's what we're doing to each other now, when we, when we, when we, we just, we just

01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:09.760
have to like, can we loosen the fucking, why am I, why am I calling to action?

01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:11.680
There's nothing that a biomass can do.

01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:15.080
That's just a sad, side effect of oppression, too.

01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:19.760
It's like, that's what the system does, is it pits the, the, the small dogs against each

01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:23.000
other and, and tells them that, that's what they should be doing.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:27.800
Otherwise, they don't have the moral authority to overthrow real oppressors, killing people

01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:29.440
and robbing families, you know?

01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:31.720
I mean, I'm not saying that you're wrong to bring it up.

01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:34.960
It's just like, that is a, that's a part of the system and it's fucked.

01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:37.320
But like, but there's a double standard here, too, right?

01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:42.360
If you, if you were to draw a gender line, only because one gender has privilege, I love

01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:43.360
it.

01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:50.080
I sound like a college student that in 1992, that, that, that, that, um, women, uh, uniting

01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:55.840
without doing it in a cigar smoke filled room, um, because why would it happen there?

01:02:55.840 --> 01:02:57.160
How would it happen there?

01:02:57.160 --> 01:03:00.800
Uh, if you're in a handmade's tale, where are you going to meet, except the produce

01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:01.800
aisle?

01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:09.120
You ain't got no fucking freemason lodge that the what, what, what, uh, uh, unprivileged

01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:15.640
movements have the total disadvantage of being open source, right?

01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:21.400
And trolls and hecklers and people that just like peer in, if it's a, if it's a movement

01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:25.960
worth its salt, if it's good, honest people that are like, well, we don't have anything

01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:26.960
to hide.

01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:30.880
So we're not going to meet in a fucking catacomb and plot the destruction of something that

01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:32.240
should get me in the electric chair.

01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:36.520
I'm like, this is a movement that's going to catch fire among the people.

01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:39.920
And it's like, but we live in this flame retardant universe.

01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:40.920
It's so unfair.

01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:44.600
You go like, Oh, women are, Oh, look, the women are saying they're hashtagging this

01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:45.600
or that.

01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:49.840
And then it's like, Oh, well, that, that should put a pretty high premium on dividing them

01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:51.160
amongst each other.

01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:53.200
And, uh, and that'll go to shit pretty quick.

01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:54.200
And then we can start laughing.

01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:57.360
I got like, geez, I wonder how come you guys don't have rights?

01:03:57.360 --> 01:03:58.360
Yeah, sure.

01:03:58.360 --> 01:03:59.920
Can't get along with each other.

01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:03.000
Meanwhile, I'm not off to my men's meeting.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:06.560
Like I don't like men and I can say that nothing will happen to me.

01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:08.880
Men, men are dumb.

01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:09.880
Uh-oh.

01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:12.880
Hey, you know what?

01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:17.000
I don't like that kind of man that's like, when he's that, that, that's like all about

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:18.840
selling himself sexually.

01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:21.960
I think, I think, I think that person should be ashamed of himself.

01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:24.360
Like I'm not going to suffer any fucking blowback for that.

01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:31.280
There's no among in some men's like, and it's because like, we don't care.

01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:32.840
That's also not fair.

01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:40.400
So when, if, if, if someone awesome, like Rose McGowan, like he's, he's like, I don't

01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:47.480
know how to say the word baggle, like, what are you fucking McGowan Rose McGowan,

01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:48.480
Gowan.

01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:54.840
Uh, if she's going, if the thing that's like catching fire is that she's fucking taken

01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:59.520
no guff, you know, like, yeah, like, like, like, you see all the, the, our old timers

01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:03.600
like are piping up and they're going like, uh, it's, it's funny because they think you

01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:06.960
go like, oh, I'm 20 years out from being that tone deaf.

01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:11.240
There you go, all of a stone here.

01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:16.600
Um, now listen, ladies, if something should offend your sensibility, it's simply give

01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:17.600
it time.

01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:19.600
There's a due process for this.

01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:26.000
Woody Allen shows to, to chime in, he goes, uh, this is, this is probably the best time

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.600
people want to hear what I think it would be.

01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:29.600
It would be a shame.

01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:30.600
Yes.

01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:37.200
Like, you would think he would know the room better than anybody, but he like, what if

01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:41.800
somebody like said, Hey, uh, Mr. Allen, uh, it looks like you're enjoying your coffee.

01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:44.120
What do you think about all this crazy stuff?

01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:45.120
No comment.

01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:46.120
Leave me alone.

01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:48.800
I'm old and it's, it's done.

01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:49.800
That's the other thing.

01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:54.920
That's the difference with the Woody Allen thing is I feel like I, that's, that is totally

01:05:54.920 --> 01:06:01.040
possible that somebody literally like, like just said that much and that he and that like

01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:06.440
his quote, the one that I heard, which was like, I hope it doesn't turn into a witch hunt.

01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:11.920
If you plaster it on the, on Times Square and a scroll and it feels like he issued a

01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:16.440
press release, like there's like an Allen Greenspan hoping we don't over invest.

01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:22.800
Um, it's like, like, like, or is it, it could also be him getting into a cab and going,

01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:27.400
I don't want to, I, I, I, I hope it doesn't, that could be an almost honest thing for him

01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:28.400
to say.

01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:32.200
Well, the last thing I need is for that to get, you know, become a trend again.

01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:33.200
Oh boy.

01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:38.280
Hey, I don't, it, this is the things you don't, you don't know the context.

01:06:38.280 --> 01:06:41.960
All I know is that he, it didn't sound like something he was saying on the way to the

01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:42.960
car.

01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:48.120
Like I don't want, it didn't, it didn't sound like I don't really want to talk about this.

01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:55.640
I know you want to comment from me, uh, you know, uh, I mean he could have easily said

01:06:55.640 --> 01:06:56.640
it's awful.

01:06:56.640 --> 01:07:04.200
I wish it didn't happen and then go away, but, but, but, but he, he, he opened his mouth

01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:09.600
and put both of his feet in and, uh, it just was like, you read it and you go, what did

01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:11.120
you think was good?

01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:18.000
You are, whether you think you did it or didn't do what you did, you know what people

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:21.920
will, the public probably thinks about you right now.

01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:28.280
So, but, but, but, but, uh, I, we don't, yeah, I, I just don't click on that note.

01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:29.840
The context wasn't here.

01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:36.800
This is all circling back to like what, and then so Rose, let's just get on a first name

01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:37.800
basis with her.

01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:45.720
So I stopped saying her last name, um, well, she's like, whatever, like, like really every

01:07:45.720 --> 01:07:55.080
fucking tweet has to be on fucking point and, and, and I like, we're going to win that game

01:07:55.080 --> 01:07:58.360
if we play the game of, does everybody have to say everything right?

01:07:58.360 --> 01:08:02.440
And that's exact, I know how confusing that can be for people because we're talking about

01:08:02.440 --> 01:08:05.480
like fucking like, don't take this shit anymore.

01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:06.960
Don't take anybody's bit.

01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:08.600
They're going to cloak it in language.

01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:11.760
They're going to say, they're going to say that's the way things work and all this stuff

01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:13.960
and like, so yeah, you know what?

01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:17.160
I'm hearing myself say it out loud and I'm like, pure wetting back to like, what the

01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:23.080
fuck am I, why is this my impulse to explain, let me, let me take another run at that and

01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:25.320
do it the way that's healthy.

01:08:25.320 --> 01:08:35.720
When I heard that Rose McGowan was catching shit, um, because she made it or didn't like

01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:41.800
put her toe over a foul line on the, on whatever bowling lane you perceive, like it, it bummed

01:08:41.800 --> 01:08:51.240
me out because I, it makes me feel like we will never gain traction organically, that

01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:57.720
we will create a world in which the only way to, um, uh, change things and, and, and, and

01:08:57.720 --> 01:09:06.000
accumulate power is to do so artificially and therefore reduce the risk of infraction along

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:07.000
the way.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:08.000
I.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:14.520
What do you think, do you think with, with, with something like when, when Rose starts

01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:20.040
saying something and yes, she's abrasive, but she's angry and she wants to be listened

01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:21.040
to.

01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:24.480
So of course she's going to be passionate about the stuff that happened to her and, and

01:09:24.480 --> 01:09:25.680
so whatever.

01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:28.160
And then Twitter locks her down.

01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:33.040
I mean, doesn't that seem like that's a fear based thing?

01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:37.080
Like no, we got to, it's like if somebody, if a prisoner is running for the wall, you

01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:42.280
know, every, every guard is going to start shooting at it because we can't let that one

01:09:42.280 --> 01:09:44.440
prisoner get over the fence.

01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:45.440
Yeah.

01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:48.280
But if every, but all these other prisoners, if they're just like, they're not going to

01:09:48.280 --> 01:09:53.800
be, they're just, if you just stay inside the prison and don't run for the wall.

01:09:53.800 --> 01:09:54.800
Oh, yeah.

01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:55.800
I mean, yeah.

01:09:55.800 --> 01:09:56.800
Yeah.

01:09:56.800 --> 01:10:00.040
No, I, I think I know what I'm saying, which is, which is, yeah, but I'm saying, I'm saying

01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:06.120
like it is, is like because we're pushing this stuff down or I don't know, I guess when

01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:12.300
I say we, when, when the world is like pushing this stuff down, it's like, no, we don't want

01:10:12.300 --> 01:10:13.300
to change.

01:10:13.300 --> 01:10:15.400
We don't want to be told we're wrong.

01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:16.400
You're wrong.

01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:22.880
And yes, do, do I think that it is harder for revolutionaries to say anything that affects

01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:23.880
people?

01:10:23.880 --> 01:10:24.880
Yes.

01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:27.960
Like it's like so parabolically stacked against people.

01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:32.040
And so then do I, but that's that, but it's, but it's a sign of like the status quo is

01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:40.040
afraid of this happening that that that's good because changes is happening.

01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:45.880
The oil that drives the engine of change is the blood of martyrs because, but just to

01:10:45.880 --> 01:10:51.320
go back to my point that I was making before is like the generation, our parents have never

01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:58.720
been more, at least from my point of view, have never been more doubled down and dug

01:10:58.720 --> 01:10:59.720
into.

01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:00.720
No, no, no.

01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:05.400
They didn't do anything worse than Clinton and I love our president and he's into Jesus

01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:11.200
Christ and, and I just ignore all these horrible things that he does because he's better than

01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:17.360
Hillary, the murderer, Hillary, who Pete's a gate, Hillary, she's better than that.

01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:20.720
And we're all going to be rich someday, just like him.

01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:22.720
And he's one of us.

01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:24.360
So I'm going to ignore all that.

01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:32.360
Like you and I, like right now, like at our age, I mean, we're, we're going through like

01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:33.360
changes.

01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:34.360
We're becoming that.

01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:39.880
I'm not saying, I'm not saying that we're better than anybody, but I think the one good

01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:46.680
thing about like the social media stuff, for me, just in terms of like what's happening

01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:53.120
now and my, how I feel about like eating meat and, and, and not an animal rights and things

01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:57.280
like that and just people rights and, and just being good.

01:11:57.280 --> 01:12:04.720
And it, it, I think that that's the one thing that I think is good is that like at our age

01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:10.120
when we should be digging in and saying, no, I wasn't wrong, we're, we're still changing

01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:11.120
and evolving.

01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:13.120
So I'm trying to put a positive spin on this.

01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:14.120
No, that's a good.

01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:15.120
Yeah.

01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:16.120
That's, that's, that's better than nothing.

01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:20.080
I also though, yeah, I want, but yeah, I think you feel more helpless because how do

01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:21.080
you change the world?

01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:26.040
But I also want to acknowledge that like your, your, your parents and my parents like, like,

01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:29.400
like when I was, I was, I was out of the image in my head when you were talking about that

01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:33.720
and talking about like, when we talk to our parents and like, how they talk about like,

01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:37.560
well, you know, when you, you, you get a sense of where they're at politically, which my

01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:44.000
mom's fucking, well, she probably wouldn't want me to expose her, but she's a, my mom's

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:45.000
on a fucking point.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:50.800
My mom's, my mom is like, like crazy, like, like she's like, she's, she's, she's down

01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:52.560
to clown on the, on the left.

01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:56.720
But I think she's kind of like, I don't want to, I don't want to dox her politically.

01:12:56.720 --> 01:12:58.800
I don't, I don't, I don't know what's going on in her house.

01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:00.880
I don't know if her and my dad are fighting or what's going on.

01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:03.680
I don't want to, I don't want to, I've, I've, I've ruined my family with my mouth.

01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:07.240
I don't, I want to let them have their lives, but, but talking about our parents is important

01:13:07.240 --> 01:13:15.440
because you, you, you, I picture like these, like, um, like, uh, these, like, Brick Brack's

01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:20.440
like, like, I picture your mom talking about politics and your dad is like, they're like

01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:24.480
in this like Midwestern house and there's like little porcelain birds and there's these

01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:29.280
things that you grew up around where they're like, who buys a porcelain bird?

01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:32.440
And, and the answer is someone who's got their shit together.

01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:39.440
But the whole time now that you and I are their age when they were talking to us, I'll, I'll

01:13:39.440 --> 01:13:43.560
speak for myself and say like, now I have a house and even though it doesn't have little

01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:47.640
porcelain birds in it, there's some equivalent of it that's like a connection that I have

01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:50.640
to like, oh, this could all go away.

01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:51.640
Yeah.

01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:55.440
And I think that it's hard for us to understand when we think about our parents in the Midwest

01:13:55.440 --> 01:13:59.160
and their little tract houses with their porcelain birds and their, and their queez and arts

01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:03.040
and their, and everything's working great and then when they talk about it needs to

01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:06.160
be like this or it doesn't need to be like that, like part of, part of how it's easy

01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:11.760
to clown them is because it seems so clear looking at them that they have nothing to

01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:12.760
worry about.

01:14:12.760 --> 01:14:13.760
Yeah.

01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:16.600
And then it's like, well, what, what kind of, what, what kind of a build the wall?

01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:18.920
QEP Newton, like, world do you live in?

01:14:18.920 --> 01:14:19.920
Build that wall.

01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:23.080
So those Mexicans don't get into Wisconsin.

01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:24.080
Yeah.

01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:25.080
And what?

01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:29.080
And so that you don't affect your plans to watch CSI Miami tomorrow night or whatever

01:14:29.080 --> 01:14:33.040
like we laugh at them because we go, yeah, but you're not in the real world because we're

01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:34.680
young city kids.

01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:40.280
But we're young city kids who are now turning 45 and we're, I own my own home.

01:14:40.280 --> 01:14:44.480
And for me, I'm like, like I now I have conversations with Duncan Trussell.

01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:48.840
He comes back from Burning Man and he starts laying into me with the like, man, you gotta

01:14:48.840 --> 01:14:50.680
just let it go, baby.

01:14:50.680 --> 01:14:54.800
And I'm like, I do like five years ago, I'd be like, yeah, you got to let it go.

01:14:54.800 --> 01:14:58.920
Let's do, do you want to do acid next Wednesday or do you want to like, let's talk like, oh,

01:14:58.920 --> 01:14:59.920
Obama's president.

01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:03.640
So let's talk about how properties theft and I'll fucking, I'll blow your mind more

01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:04.640
than you could blow mine.

01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:12.520
But now for real, like it's like, oh, I, I, I have a job and I have a five bedroom house

01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:18.200
and he comes on, I go on his podcast and he's like, yeah, but why don't you just let some

01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:21.320
people hang out here, man?

01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:25.080
And I'm like, I totally should, but seriously, I can't do that.

01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:26.080
Yeah.

01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:30.240
And then I had a whole conversation with him where I was like, that's, I'm my parents.

01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:31.240
He's here worried.

01:15:31.240 --> 01:15:35.440
I just because I don't have a porcelain bird, I mean, like they're worried.

01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:39.440
People are worried about being taken advantage of, you know, like just being, I just got

01:15:39.440 --> 01:15:40.440
here.

01:15:40.440 --> 01:15:44.360
It's like the Judge Reinhold Fast Times Regiment High thing, but that's, that's the thing.

01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:50.400
Like whenever anybody calls you privileged or it's a scene in Fast Times, I'm hanging

01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:54.560
on by a thread guidance counselor does this monologue to Judge Reinhold who's still dressed

01:15:54.560 --> 01:15:57.120
in his fucking pirate fast food outfit.

01:15:57.120 --> 01:16:00.280
She says, sorry, but it's time to enroll in a college.

01:16:00.280 --> 01:16:03.160
Like, like, I don't know where you've been, but the party's over.

01:16:03.160 --> 01:16:07.000
And he's like, you've just watched him the whole movie, like just delivered fast food.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:10.960
And he's like, I don't know, he does some mini monologue back that's like, fuck you that

01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:13.240
winded the party starter, whatever.

01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:18.560
That is how somebody that you wouldn't believe you're like you with your porcelain birds.

01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:20.400
Why are you talking about liberty?

01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:21.840
Why are you talking about anything?

01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:22.840
Yeah.

01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:23.840
Why are you in this conversation?

01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:27.720
You're just patriotic about porcelain birds, like they're cheap.

01:16:27.720 --> 01:16:30.000
You get them at home depot.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:31.000
You already own them.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:32.440
You're not buying anything.

01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:36.320
You're watching a fucking television with America playing across it.

01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:37.400
You're almost dead.

01:16:37.400 --> 01:16:38.720
You saved for your medical bills.

01:16:38.720 --> 01:16:41.160
Now they're going to shoot them into you, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

01:16:41.160 --> 01:16:45.800
Like we look at, I look at older people and I judge them like, like, like, why are they,

01:16:45.800 --> 01:16:49.000
why do they have so much control over what's going on?

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:56.520
I get the feeling lately, like 25 year olds see me that way, that they think that they're

01:16:56.520 --> 01:17:00.760
looking at what I have as more permanent than I am looking at it.

01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:08.280
I feel like I am five minutes from, depending on which way the wind blows, one committee

01:17:08.280 --> 01:17:14.520
or another dressed in one color jumpsuit or another coming up to my door and saying,

01:17:14.520 --> 01:17:18.400
like, you didn't earn this house, you don't get to have this.

01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:24.360
This is, we're changing the name of this state where you, you, you, you, we, we just found

01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:30.240
your name on a, on a Google list that like, oh, we didn't know you were into feet.

01:17:30.240 --> 01:17:37.040
Like that's, that's, that's a sign of, of ISIS now, whether it was right wing, left

01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:45.840
wing, west wing or, or young Sheldon, whatever hit show, I live constantly going like they're

01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:46.840
going to come get me.

01:17:46.840 --> 01:17:49.840
Yeah, I think, I feel that way.

01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:51.040
And so what if our parents feel that way?

01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:52.280
I'm sure they do feel that way.

01:17:52.280 --> 01:17:59.880
I mean, that's because that's, you know, every email from my relatives for like, look at

01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:04.320
what, look at what the, when Obama was president, you know, look what they're, look what these

01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:07.160
people are doing, you know, we're going to have to work hard and we're going to have

01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:14.080
to pay for some lazy, poor person, uh, their medical bills.

01:18:14.080 --> 01:18:15.160
Why should we do that?

01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:21.800
You know, and it's, they're worried that they're going to be taken advantage of, I,

01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:27.120
you know, or their stuff being taken away, their, their birds are going to be taken away.

01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:29.000
Nobody wants your fucking birds.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:36.760
It's just, it's crazy because my parents and my family are so religious.

01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:43.880
They go to church like three times a week and it's one book, you know, what, haven't

01:18:43.880 --> 01:18:45.080
you read it already?

01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:48.880
What else are you going to find out new about the Bible?

01:18:48.880 --> 01:18:53.480
You know, somebody, oh, they just found some new discoveries, found a couple of new pages

01:18:53.480 --> 01:18:54.480
here.

01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:59.960
It looks like carrots are, are not as holy as we thought they were.

01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:00.960
That is fucking insane.

01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:01.960
I mean, it's one fucking book.

01:19:01.960 --> 01:19:05.640
Now that we know there are people who have done a podcast where it's like 200 episodes

01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:11.880
of a podcast where their gimmick was they're going to watch grownups to every, we've demystified

01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:16.840
the idea of going through Star Wars one minute at a time.

01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:22.520
The entire like trilogy and, and all of the trilogies and there's people still going to

01:19:22.520 --> 01:19:28.040
church every week going, it's just such a big book and it's so complicated.

01:19:28.040 --> 01:19:30.280
Like I wonder what part we'll talk about this time.

01:19:30.280 --> 01:19:34.160
Do you want to, do you want to, you know what, there's, there's, there's, there's, right,

01:19:34.160 --> 01:19:35.160
right.

01:19:35.160 --> 01:19:41.000
I was, I've spent the last 10 years like, oh, don't my colleagues all are like, I, I'm

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:42.000
Joseph Campbell.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:45.720
So I'll stick up for Christianity, but like I'm saying, yeah, the American like Midwestern

01:19:45.720 --> 01:19:50.280
church, like culture where it's like, this is fucking ridiculous.

01:19:50.280 --> 01:19:54.360
We were pretending that we haven't had the chance to look through that book from cover

01:19:54.360 --> 01:19:55.360
to cover.

01:19:55.360 --> 01:19:56.360
Yeah.

01:19:56.360 --> 01:19:57.360
I mean, come on.

01:19:57.360 --> 01:19:58.360
Some parts are boring.

01:19:58.360 --> 01:20:00.160
It's the Old Testament does a lot of begets.

01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:02.200
Like I've tried going through this thing.

01:20:02.200 --> 01:20:04.800
It's okay to say it's a boring book.

01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:07.040
It's also, you haven't read the whole thing.

01:20:07.040 --> 01:20:08.040
Yeah.

01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:10.960
I mean, it's crazy that they, they, it's a book that you haven't read.

01:20:10.960 --> 01:20:15.000
That has huge boring parts that you could read and like not understand.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:19.240
And then, and then you go to a building and the guy says, today we're going to talk about

01:20:19.240 --> 01:20:24.000
what this thing, this doesn't make any sense at all.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:29.480
If you just read the words, if you read the words is beget and vow and above, above, above.

01:20:29.480 --> 01:20:35.160
Nobody talks like that and nobody, you know, nobody lives to be 500 and the cool ones are

01:20:35.160 --> 01:20:39.200
the ones that go like, so here's what Jesus is saying just cause it doesn't make any sense

01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:41.200
when we read it.

01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:43.400
It's like an English teacher taking you through Macbeth.

01:20:43.400 --> 01:20:45.920
Macbeth is saying, hey, be cool.

01:20:45.920 --> 01:20:48.640
You know, like, and then we're all like, whoa, wow, thanks for teaching us.

01:20:48.640 --> 01:20:55.560
You do that for four years and you do that for four years in, in high school and then

01:20:55.560 --> 01:21:01.240
you're done with it and then maybe you'll see the movie, but these people go every fucking

01:21:01.240 --> 01:21:07.480
week and really like, should he say like, okay, listen, don't be a dick to each other.

01:21:07.480 --> 01:21:08.480
Class dismissed.

01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:11.200
Okay, we're going to take the rest of the summer off.

01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:13.280
Don't be an asshole to each other.

01:21:13.280 --> 01:21:18.520
Well in my doubt, here's the, here's the threat and that's why like, yeah, I, we saw Jesus

01:21:18.520 --> 01:21:23.160
Christ Superstar like, like when we were like in our twenties and like, I got really into

01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:24.160
it.

01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:25.160
I was like, oh shit, man.

01:21:25.160 --> 01:21:26.160
This is a great musical.

01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:27.160
Like I love these songs.

01:21:27.160 --> 01:21:28.160
Yeah.

01:21:28.160 --> 01:21:32.640
And then because the song sounded so good, I like, I started watching more discovery

01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:37.240
channel shows about Jesus and reading the stuff that Campbell said about Jesus and like,

01:21:37.240 --> 01:21:41.080
I still haven't really gotten cover to cover it through the New Testament, but I feel like

01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:44.800
I know Jesus a little bit better than a lot of people that get paid a lot of money to

01:21:44.800 --> 01:21:45.800
say they know Jesus.

01:21:45.800 --> 01:21:46.800
Yeah.

01:21:46.800 --> 01:21:49.920
And that's the reason why I think because it's not a complicated myth.

01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:50.920
No.

01:21:50.920 --> 01:21:51.920
It's, it's very nuanced.

01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:56.800
There's a lot of room for exploration and constant talk about it, but it is pretty much

01:21:56.800 --> 01:22:05.840
diehard except, uh, instead of being afraid to fly, he's sort of afraid to die, um, and

01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:10.840
the Nakatomi Plaza is, uh, is, uh, the Sermon on the Mount.

01:22:10.840 --> 01:22:11.840
Sure.

01:22:11.840 --> 01:22:12.840
Right?

01:22:12.840 --> 01:22:13.840
I don't know.

01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:16.840
I don't know the Bible or Bible.

01:22:16.840 --> 01:22:19.520
Wait, didn't you go through a biblical, weren't you raised?

01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:20.520
No, I know the Bible.

01:22:20.520 --> 01:22:21.520
Yeah.

01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:24.200
No, I was what Rob was saying really quick that I think for the same reason as you is

01:22:24.200 --> 01:22:28.360
because I do encounter a lot of Christians and it's like, wait, don't I know more about

01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:31.640
the Bible than you and shouldn't I not know more about the Bible than you?

01:22:31.640 --> 01:22:32.640
Because there's a block.

01:22:32.640 --> 01:22:33.640
Yeah.

01:22:33.640 --> 01:22:34.640
Because they're not actually studying.

01:22:34.640 --> 01:22:36.240
They're just studying it.

01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:43.440
They're, they're told if you go to church every, every Sunday and keep saying, I believe

01:22:43.440 --> 01:22:44.440
in Jesus.

01:22:44.440 --> 01:22:45.440
I believe in Jesus.

01:22:45.440 --> 01:22:51.040
When you die, you get to have ice cream forever and your favorite television show will play

01:22:51.040 --> 01:22:56.360
on a loop and you'll see all of your old pets and your family and you'll be able to

01:22:56.360 --> 01:22:58.720
hang out with Lincoln in heaven and stuff like that.

01:22:58.720 --> 01:23:02.400
But keep in mind, there's a Muslim version of all this stuff that you'll be laughing

01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:07.640
at when someone tells you they read on a bubblegum wrapper that that's what they believe.

01:23:07.640 --> 01:23:15.280
And that's why the minute, the minute, you know, the minute you, you say like, well,

01:23:15.280 --> 01:23:17.800
why don't you, why don't you help the poor?

01:23:17.800 --> 01:23:24.480
I mean, because I mean, isn't, didn't God or Jesus say do unto others as you would do

01:23:24.480 --> 01:23:25.480
unto yourself?

01:23:25.480 --> 01:23:26.480
Wouldn't you help?

01:23:26.480 --> 01:23:30.520
Wouldn't you, you're giving 10% of your paycheck to the church.

01:23:30.520 --> 01:23:35.280
Why isn't the church full of homeless people during the other six days?

01:23:35.280 --> 01:23:36.880
It's not being used.

01:23:36.880 --> 01:23:39.520
Why, why it doesn't pay taxes.

01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:45.240
Why can't you, why is really, can't you give some of this money so we can all have affordable

01:23:45.240 --> 01:23:48.120
because everybody gets sick.

01:23:48.120 --> 01:23:49.120
Everybody dies.

01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:51.200
Nobody wants to have their loved ones.

01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:52.200
What is it?

01:23:52.200 --> 01:23:53.200
Shouldn't you be going?

01:23:53.200 --> 01:23:54.200
Yes.

01:23:54.200 --> 01:23:55.200
Take all of our money.

01:23:55.200 --> 01:23:59.640
The least popular thing Jesus ever said was sell all your stuff and follow me.

01:23:59.640 --> 01:24:00.640
Yeah.

01:24:00.640 --> 01:24:01.640
Give it to the poor.

01:24:01.640 --> 01:24:02.640
Yeah.

01:24:02.640 --> 01:24:03.640
No one likes talking about that.

01:24:03.640 --> 01:24:04.640
No, no, no.

01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:05.640
Because they don't want to give up their fucking birds.

01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:06.640
Right.

01:24:06.640 --> 01:24:07.640
Neither did the rich man.

01:24:07.640 --> 01:24:08.640
Right.

01:24:08.640 --> 01:24:09.640
He went away sad at the same time.

01:24:09.640 --> 01:24:11.800
He went away sad because, ah, that, I mean, I, I, I can't do it.

01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:16.000
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not killing anybody and I don't, I don't, I don't know.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:19.080
You know, I said, wouldn't it be nice to have a third Testament where it's a, or, or like

01:24:19.080 --> 01:24:24.120
a, or like a two point five where it's like, it's, it's, it's like, hey, uh, I gotta, because

01:24:24.120 --> 01:24:28.280
I, I, I've stood in a microphone and said, hey, I think capitalism might be the root

01:24:28.280 --> 01:24:30.240
of a lot of our problems that we're having.

01:24:30.240 --> 01:24:35.640
Like the idea that everything has a price seems to keep trickling sideways over into

01:24:35.640 --> 01:24:40.040
these stories you scratch your heads about where the cost of a bullet is less than the

01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:41.760
cost of killing a black child.

01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:42.760
Yeah.

01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:46.040
Like, like, hasn't capitalism and its heart doesn't, it ends up getting us here.

01:24:46.040 --> 01:24:50.880
And then, you know, like, like, like the Reddit the next day, like, well, if you hate capitalism

01:24:50.880 --> 01:24:56.720
so much, wouldn't we know that you meant that by you giving your house away and eating

01:24:56.720 --> 01:25:03.040
your own foot, I don't, I, what I would like is for a guy to come up to Jesus in the New

01:25:03.040 --> 01:25:08.720
Testament and say, hey, listen, uh, must be nice, son of God, hey, I never said I was

01:25:08.720 --> 01:25:09.720
the son of God.

01:25:09.720 --> 01:25:10.720
Yeah.

01:25:10.720 --> 01:25:11.720
I heard that's your shtick.

01:25:11.720 --> 01:25:12.720
Yeah.

01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:13.720
I'm not, I don't know.

01:25:13.720 --> 01:25:14.720
You do keep saying that you're, you do keep saying.

01:25:14.720 --> 01:25:15.720
That's what you said.

01:25:15.720 --> 01:25:16.720
I never said that.

01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:17.720
I never said that.

01:25:17.720 --> 01:25:25.560
But you are living a very rarefied life right now, uh, uh, yes, I am.

01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:30.080
But you know, uh, I just do what I do.

01:25:30.080 --> 01:25:31.080
Okay.

01:25:31.080 --> 01:25:32.080
So I do what I do.

01:25:32.080 --> 01:25:33.080
That's what my teacher said.

01:25:33.080 --> 01:25:35.720
And the whole New Testament is why it's an inspiring story is because it's like, what

01:25:35.720 --> 01:25:39.440
if you woke up the next day and you just fucking did that?

01:25:39.440 --> 01:25:43.560
What if you just calls it like you see it, walk around and the answer is, according to

01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:47.960
that book, some people will come up to you and say, but I'm a police officer.

01:25:47.960 --> 01:25:49.400
What would you want me to do?

01:25:49.400 --> 01:25:51.800
And you would say, Hey man, what's police?

01:25:51.800 --> 01:25:52.800
What's an officer?

01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:56.960
And he would like drop his spear and like, and like freak out and I'm not making fun

01:25:56.960 --> 01:25:57.960
of it.

01:25:57.960 --> 01:26:03.200
Like I, I, I, what, if that's not the thing that's going to change shit, what is, by the

01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:07.760
way, encountering some dude who fucking blows your mind and there's, you know, why can't

01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:11.320
the answer be, I don't know.

01:26:11.320 --> 01:26:13.840
I have, I've worked my whole life.

01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:15.040
I've been told my whole life.

01:26:15.040 --> 01:26:19.720
So, uh, so you're saying like from the, from the New Christ, yeah, why can't the answer

01:26:19.720 --> 01:26:22.680
be, Hey man, I'm not sure.

01:26:22.680 --> 01:26:23.680
I don't know.

01:26:23.680 --> 01:26:25.480
I'm just trying to get by like everybody else.

01:26:25.480 --> 01:26:31.880
And the answer is because it would be a decentralized, non hierarchical, like modern compliant myth

01:26:31.880 --> 01:26:36.840
about all of you instead of a protagonist in the story, who's some dude that we're supposed

01:26:36.840 --> 01:26:37.840
to like be like.

01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:42.640
And if we're not like him, then we fucked up like that it's just a story as it was originally

01:26:42.640 --> 01:26:43.640
intended.

01:26:43.640 --> 01:26:49.160
I would believe about what if you, what if you just, what if, if you give a mouse a cookie,

01:26:49.160 --> 01:26:52.760
just the millennials that, you know, all right, no, let's not get off on that.

01:26:52.760 --> 01:26:56.840
Like this idea, like, like, you know what happens if you wake up one day and you start

01:26:56.840 --> 01:27:00.920
causing it, like you seize it, you only live to about 33 and then they nail you to a piece

01:27:00.920 --> 01:27:02.080
of wood.

01:27:02.080 --> 01:27:06.680
That's like, that, that, but you get to meet, you get to meet David Bowie, uh, like, like

01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:10.920
you, you, you, I, it beats prostate cancer.

01:27:10.920 --> 01:27:16.280
I don't know what to tell you, Mac, like, like, who else was crucified on Golgotha?

01:27:16.280 --> 01:27:18.120
Like what, who are these other people?

01:27:18.120 --> 01:27:19.480
Did they snatch purses?

01:27:19.480 --> 01:27:21.160
Were they also God Kim?

01:27:21.160 --> 01:27:24.360
Did they, did they threaten the fate of Judea?

01:27:24.360 --> 01:27:28.800
I don't know what I, like, like what I'm saying to you is, yes, it's true.

01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:29.800
It's very true.

01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:34.840
If you were to start searching your conscience before you reacted to anything ever, it's true.

01:27:34.840 --> 01:27:38.200
Your path could be absolutely uncontrollably short.

01:27:38.200 --> 01:27:42.440
You could end up out of work on Wednesday and under a bridge on Thursday and, uh, not

01:27:42.440 --> 01:27:46.840
in an intervention episode and you could just like be a pile of bones in a sewer next to

01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:52.120
Tim Curry, just as a clown floating, uh, and, and not, but not even acknowledged in the final

01:27:52.120 --> 01:27:53.560
tally of who floats.

01:27:53.560 --> 01:27:54.560
Oh, okay.

01:27:54.560 --> 01:27:58.800
Well, like when Tim Curry would say they all float, he might exclude you to just to add,

01:27:58.800 --> 01:28:01.080
I just want to make sure this is a nightmare scenario.

01:28:01.080 --> 01:28:04.040
I don't even want your bones in Tim Curry's float catalog.

01:28:04.040 --> 01:28:05.040
Right.

01:28:05.040 --> 01:28:06.920
When he says they all, you'll float too.

01:28:06.920 --> 01:28:08.680
He's not talking about you.

01:28:08.680 --> 01:28:10.160
You'll just be, you'll be, you'll be bones.

01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:11.160
He didn't even know.

01:28:11.160 --> 01:28:14.520
Well, what if he's just starting out?

01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:17.760
You know, I mean, he says, uh, you'll float too.

01:28:17.760 --> 01:28:19.440
Oh, sorry, Timmy.

01:28:19.440 --> 01:28:20.440
You know what?

01:28:20.440 --> 01:28:22.520
I said earlier, you'd float too.

01:28:22.520 --> 01:28:27.040
I meant the royal you, the second person.

01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:28.760
We're hoping to get some others.

01:28:28.760 --> 01:28:30.600
I got a couple of other kids.

01:28:30.600 --> 01:28:34.200
It's like when Uncle Sam says he wants you, he doesn't want you, Timmy.

01:28:34.200 --> 01:28:36.360
You might be, you might have flat feet.

01:28:36.360 --> 01:28:37.760
I just started out here.

01:28:37.760 --> 01:28:42.600
Whether you float or not depends largely on your methane content, your fear, whatever

01:28:42.600 --> 01:28:43.600
you were afraid of.

01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:45.440
Listen, it's raining.

01:28:45.440 --> 01:28:47.240
I'm getting pretty wet down here.

01:28:47.240 --> 01:28:48.240
Are you in or out?

01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:49.240
Come on down.

01:28:49.240 --> 01:28:50.240
You'll float.

01:28:50.240 --> 01:28:51.240
Are you going to float?

01:28:51.240 --> 01:28:52.240
You'll float too.

01:28:52.240 --> 01:28:53.240
I mean that figuratively.

01:28:53.240 --> 01:28:54.240
It's not a litigatable phrase.

01:28:54.240 --> 01:28:55.240
You'll float too.

01:28:55.240 --> 01:28:56.240
Yeah.

01:28:56.240 --> 01:28:57.240
In or out.

01:28:57.240 --> 01:28:59.000
I just, I copyright wrote the, the, the, the slogan.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:07.120
I mean, what the second kid, it'll make sense, but you, can you just, uh, uh, Patrick

01:29:07.120 --> 01:29:10.880
listener here, couldn't you have started like this and given me 90 minutes of this?

01:29:10.880 --> 01:29:12.200
You have in the past.

01:29:12.200 --> 01:29:15.480
Very funny this riffing about it.

01:29:15.480 --> 01:29:23.040
If I wanted to listen to thoughts about your politic, your rambling rants about, uh, women,

01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:33.800
I could have listened to, uh, I don't, um, yes, Paul, you, you were, you were, are you

01:29:33.800 --> 01:29:34.800
okay?

01:29:34.800 --> 01:29:38.240
Paul, what's the matter?

01:29:38.240 --> 01:29:39.640
You said, you, you stopped right there.

01:29:39.640 --> 01:29:45.200
He said you were going to listen to somebody and now you're, are you giggling or are you,

01:29:45.200 --> 01:29:46.200
what are you doing?

01:29:46.200 --> 01:29:47.800
You will all join me.

01:29:47.800 --> 01:29:48.800
You will all join me.

01:29:48.800 --> 01:29:49.800
No, I didn't say that.

01:29:49.800 --> 01:29:51.000
That was a dumb direction to take that.

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:52.800
Oh, Paul, you were doing a best.

01:29:52.800 --> 01:29:53.800
Yeah.

01:29:53.800 --> 01:29:54.800
No, the other podcast, I don't know.

01:29:54.800 --> 01:29:57.640
I wanted to throw, I don't want to, uh, I could listen to another podcast.

01:29:57.640 --> 01:29:58.640
Right.

01:29:58.640 --> 01:29:59.640
You could.

01:29:59.640 --> 01:30:01.680
And yet you're here.

01:30:01.680 --> 01:30:03.960
But I paid.

01:30:03.960 --> 01:30:04.960
You right?

01:30:04.960 --> 01:30:06.520
I'm a, I'm a streaming subscriber.

01:30:06.520 --> 01:30:09.440
Right.

01:30:09.440 --> 01:30:10.440
And you're here.

01:30:10.440 --> 01:30:12.440
Well, I expect better next week.

01:30:12.440 --> 01:30:14.440
Well, guess what?

01:30:14.440 --> 01:30:17.040
What, what, what, what?

01:30:17.040 --> 01:30:20.920
You're going to get what you're going to get because it's, it's, it's, it's, this is what

01:30:20.920 --> 01:30:21.920
you signed up for.

01:30:21.920 --> 01:30:26.120
So you expect me to give you $5 a month in exchange to whatever happens?

01:30:26.120 --> 01:30:28.440
Uh, that's what you signed up for.

01:30:28.440 --> 01:30:29.440
Yeah.

01:30:29.440 --> 01:30:30.440
Mm hmm.

01:30:30.440 --> 01:30:31.440
Mm hmm.

01:30:31.440 --> 01:30:33.440
Have you guys noticed how nice Spencer's shorts are?

01:30:33.440 --> 01:30:34.440
Look at those shorts.

01:30:34.440 --> 01:30:35.440
Oh.

01:30:35.440 --> 01:30:36.440
Are those from Bombfell?

01:30:36.440 --> 01:30:37.440
I don't know.

01:30:37.440 --> 01:30:38.440
They look like they could be.

01:30:38.440 --> 01:30:41.440
Bombfell has high quality clothes delivered directly to your.

01:30:41.440 --> 01:30:42.440
Are you shitting me?

01:30:42.440 --> 01:30:43.440
Is that a segue?

01:30:43.440 --> 01:30:44.440
No, it's not.

01:30:44.440 --> 01:30:45.440
Did you really?

01:30:45.440 --> 01:30:46.440
No.

01:30:46.440 --> 01:30:47.440
Oh my God.

01:30:47.440 --> 01:30:48.440
I was like, wow, that was smooth.

01:30:48.440 --> 01:30:49.440
All right.

01:30:49.440 --> 01:30:50.440
I'm your dick.

01:30:50.440 --> 01:30:52.440
I just wanted to do that.

01:30:52.440 --> 01:30:53.440
It's a 943.

01:30:53.440 --> 01:30:57.440
So if we were going to play D&D, we have the out that Jeff's not here.

01:30:57.440 --> 01:30:59.440
So we don't have to play D&D and we could just wrap up.

01:30:59.440 --> 01:31:02.440
Do you want to, do you want Kate to play D&D?

01:31:02.440 --> 01:31:03.440
My wife?

01:31:03.440 --> 01:31:09.440
Good question after talking about how we should respect women for 90 minutes.

01:31:09.440 --> 01:31:11.440
She's really good at magic cards.

01:31:11.440 --> 01:31:12.440
We don't even have it.

01:31:12.440 --> 01:31:13.440
She's really good at magic.

01:31:13.440 --> 01:31:15.440
I mean, I was talking to Kelly last night.

01:31:15.440 --> 01:31:18.440
She hasn't been playing that long, if I understand, but really, really good.

01:31:18.440 --> 01:31:21.440
She's been kicking your ass is what I've been hearing.

01:31:21.440 --> 01:31:23.440
I'd say, I mean.

01:31:23.440 --> 01:31:28.440
I know you were saying the other week, I want to play magic with your wife.

01:31:28.440 --> 01:31:29.440
With your wife.

01:31:29.440 --> 01:31:30.440
Yeah.

01:31:30.440 --> 01:31:36.440
The next weekend, Kate is like, I'm going to play magic with Spencer.

01:31:36.440 --> 01:31:39.440
And I was like, well, he won.

01:31:39.440 --> 01:31:40.440
I'm not.

01:31:40.440 --> 01:31:41.440
He won.

01:31:41.440 --> 01:31:42.440
The ultimate magic move.

01:31:42.440 --> 01:31:45.440
I don't play against a lot of good players.

01:31:45.440 --> 01:31:48.440
Why is Kate the best magic player?

01:31:48.440 --> 01:31:49.440
I don't know.

01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:50.440
It's weird.

01:31:50.440 --> 01:31:53.440
Usually when you teach someone to play magic, they follow a very slow progression.

01:31:53.440 --> 01:31:58.440
And it's very frustrating to play with new magic players because they don't seem to catch

01:31:58.440 --> 01:31:59.440
on very quick.

01:31:59.440 --> 01:32:02.440
But she might, like Zach is the other guy who's good.

01:32:02.440 --> 01:32:03.440
And then Ryan, we play with.

01:32:03.440 --> 01:32:04.440
Ryan's probably the best.

01:32:04.440 --> 01:32:08.440
But I think she might be better than Zach, which is saying something because presumably

01:32:08.440 --> 01:32:09.440
Zach taught her to play.

01:32:09.440 --> 01:32:12.440
It's hard to surpass a teacher that quick.

01:32:12.440 --> 01:32:15.440
And that's your Darth Vader, which Kate is.

01:32:15.440 --> 01:32:16.440
Right.

01:32:16.440 --> 01:32:17.440
Yeah.

01:32:17.440 --> 01:32:18.440
But here's the thing.

01:32:18.440 --> 01:32:27.440
I think Kate has this almost magical ability to find stuff.

01:32:27.440 --> 01:32:31.440
And I think it's because there's cards and it's supernatural.

01:32:31.440 --> 01:32:34.440
Like she's better at finding like keys and things.

01:32:34.440 --> 01:32:35.440
Well, yeah.

01:32:35.440 --> 01:32:36.440
Absolutely.

01:32:36.440 --> 01:32:37.440
No, no, no.

01:32:37.440 --> 01:32:38.440
And assuming that that's supernatural.

01:32:38.440 --> 01:32:40.440
I'll go.

01:32:40.440 --> 01:32:43.440
This happens like five times a day.

01:32:43.440 --> 01:32:44.440
Fuck.

01:32:44.440 --> 01:32:46.440
I got to let the dog out or I'm gonna be late for my meeting.

01:32:46.440 --> 01:32:47.440
I can't find my keys.

01:32:47.440 --> 01:32:51.440
Do you want me to help you find your keys?

01:32:51.440 --> 01:32:52.440
No.

01:32:52.440 --> 01:32:54.440
I can find my own keys.

01:32:54.440 --> 01:32:55.440
Kate.

01:32:55.440 --> 01:32:56.440
I can find my own keys.

01:32:56.440 --> 01:32:57.440
Where are my keys?

01:32:57.440 --> 01:32:58.440
Where are my keys?

01:32:58.440 --> 01:32:59.440
Where are my keys?

01:32:59.440 --> 01:33:00.440
Where are my keys?

01:33:00.440 --> 01:33:01.440
Do you want me?

01:33:01.440 --> 01:33:02.440
Yeah.

01:33:02.440 --> 01:33:03.440
They're right here.

01:33:03.440 --> 01:33:05.440
She always she could find anything.

01:33:05.440 --> 01:33:07.440
She's got excellent finding skills.

01:33:07.440 --> 01:33:11.440
When I was married to McGathey, so she's the source of this or someone else's.

01:33:11.440 --> 01:33:12.440
But she sold.

01:33:12.440 --> 01:33:13.440
I didn't need shells.

01:33:13.440 --> 01:33:16.440
I didn't decide that this was a thing.

01:33:16.440 --> 01:33:20.440
Thanks because this is like declarations of but I had heard a thing that I didn't directly

01:33:20.440 --> 01:33:25.440
read about women being better scanners.

01:33:25.440 --> 01:33:31.440
Visually that could have come from the pages of hustler.

01:33:31.440 --> 01:33:32.440
I don't know.

01:33:32.440 --> 01:33:37.440
My mom said there's male pattern blindness and that's why guys can never find things and

01:33:37.440 --> 01:33:38.440
women can't find them.

01:33:38.440 --> 01:33:43.440
Something about like the idea was I'm not pushing this forth and saying I believe it.

01:33:43.440 --> 01:33:49.440
I'm saying I found this in the bamboo forest of my mind because someone put it there.

01:33:49.440 --> 01:33:51.440
It was a thing that came up at some point.

01:33:51.440 --> 01:33:55.440
The idea that women because I've experienced the same thing.

01:33:55.440 --> 01:33:56.440
Yeah.

01:33:56.440 --> 01:34:02.440
But with more than one like I like I'm like where and then they get involved and then

01:34:02.440 --> 01:34:05.440
it's immediately very quickly.

01:34:05.440 --> 01:34:09.440
And it's embarrassing because it's like on a shoe and you're like but that's a shoe

01:34:09.440 --> 01:34:10.440
and the keys.

01:34:10.440 --> 01:34:11.440
Yeah.

01:34:11.440 --> 01:34:16.440
The idea was that this is so counter to everything that we said that women can like

01:34:16.440 --> 01:34:22.440
take a Robocop like snapshot in a second and they see everything at once.

01:34:22.440 --> 01:34:27.440
I bet that's got to be because that just feeds into the ideas that they're like.

01:34:27.440 --> 01:34:32.440
It's the only woman that I've ever met that could do it to this degree.

01:34:32.440 --> 01:34:38.440
And I think she's also it doesn't surprise me that she's good at magic cards.

01:34:38.440 --> 01:34:43.440
So and also she plays to win.

01:34:43.440 --> 01:34:44.440
Right.

01:34:44.440 --> 01:34:47.440
She plays to win.

01:34:47.440 --> 01:34:50.440
I don't like games because it's not.

01:34:50.440 --> 01:34:51.440
I don't like competition.

01:34:51.440 --> 01:34:52.440
I don't think it's it's fun.

01:34:52.440 --> 01:34:54.440
I don't like I don't play to win.

01:34:54.440 --> 01:34:55.440
I don't like losing.

01:34:55.440 --> 01:34:56.440
I see.

01:34:56.440 --> 01:34:58.440
I don't mind losing.

01:34:58.440 --> 01:35:00.440
I don't have it in me to go.

01:35:00.440 --> 01:35:01.440
I have to win.

01:35:01.440 --> 01:35:02.440
Right.

01:35:02.440 --> 01:35:08.440
Because I go if I lose bucket it's it's how fun is this anyway.

01:35:08.440 --> 01:35:11.440
But Kate is more.

01:35:11.440 --> 01:35:12.440
No.

01:35:12.440 --> 01:35:13.440
I'm winning.

01:35:13.440 --> 01:35:15.440
I'm trying to I like trying to win.

01:35:15.440 --> 01:35:16.440
But I don't.

01:35:16.440 --> 01:35:21.440
But I feel bad when if I'm playing a game like.

01:35:21.440 --> 01:35:24.440
Like like where I feel like the other I can't win.

01:35:24.440 --> 01:35:27.440
Because I actually feel bad for the other person.

01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:29.440
I'm like like Cody taught me connect for it.

01:35:29.440 --> 01:35:31.440
I was like you can't win.

01:35:31.440 --> 01:35:33.440
I can't wait to connect for it.

01:35:33.440 --> 01:35:37.440
But but but but I also I've won a couple of times.

01:35:37.440 --> 01:35:38.440
That's a bad example.

01:35:38.440 --> 01:35:42.440
Like because it keeps me just going like I'm going to fucking win.

01:35:42.440 --> 01:35:43.440
That's what I like.

01:35:43.440 --> 01:35:46.440
I think it's funny and fun to be like I want to win.

01:35:46.440 --> 01:35:48.440
This is the most important thing in the world.

01:35:48.440 --> 01:35:53.440
But only if it means that you might kind of maybe believe you have to believe in it.

01:35:53.440 --> 01:35:57.440
Because there's some most games I'm so bad at that I can't really.

01:35:57.440 --> 01:35:58.440
It's like who are we kidding.

01:35:58.440 --> 01:35:59.440
I'm not going to win.

01:35:59.440 --> 01:36:00.440
Right.

01:36:00.440 --> 01:36:01.440
I feel like you'd be a Scrabble master.

01:36:01.440 --> 01:36:02.440
No.

01:36:02.440 --> 01:36:03.440
That's what a lot of people think.

01:36:03.440 --> 01:36:05.440
That's why you're Pictionary.

01:36:05.440 --> 01:36:06.440
Yeah.

01:36:06.440 --> 01:36:07.440
Yeah.

01:36:07.440 --> 01:36:08.440
Finally.

01:36:08.440 --> 01:36:10.440
You're amazing at Pictionary.

01:36:10.440 --> 01:36:11.440
No.

01:36:11.440 --> 01:36:13.440
I fucking hate Pictionary.

01:36:13.440 --> 01:36:16.440
And I fucking hate Pictionary.

01:36:16.440 --> 01:36:18.440
Don't ask me to play Pictionary.

01:36:18.440 --> 01:36:21.440
Because whenever somebody goes let's play Pictionary.

01:36:21.440 --> 01:36:23.440
People go well Rob's on our team.

01:36:23.440 --> 01:36:26.440
And I was like motherfucker I didn't even say I was going to play.

01:36:26.440 --> 01:36:28.440
You didn't even ask.

01:36:28.440 --> 01:36:30.440
You're not even looking at me.

01:36:30.440 --> 01:36:31.440
Rob's on my team.

01:36:31.440 --> 01:36:33.440
Rob's on my team.

01:36:33.440 --> 01:36:34.440
Go fuck yourself.

01:36:34.440 --> 01:36:35.440
I'm going home.

01:36:35.440 --> 01:36:37.440
Fuck off.

01:36:37.440 --> 01:36:39.440
Fuck off.

01:36:39.440 --> 01:36:41.440
Seriously go fuck yourself.

01:36:41.440 --> 01:36:43.440
But this is like a 20 year old.

01:36:43.440 --> 01:36:46.440
The last time I talked about something you used to say all the time.

01:36:46.440 --> 01:36:48.440
You were like how long ago was that.

01:36:48.440 --> 01:36:49.440
Excuse me.

01:36:49.440 --> 01:36:50.440
Is that an impression.

01:36:50.440 --> 01:36:51.440
Yeah.

01:36:51.440 --> 01:36:52.440
I knew what you mean.

01:36:52.440 --> 01:36:53.440
How long ago.

01:36:53.440 --> 01:36:54.440
So yeah.

01:36:54.440 --> 01:36:55.440
I mean like but you're not thinking about it.

01:36:55.440 --> 01:36:56.440
You don't really know.

01:36:56.440 --> 01:36:57.440
About writing utensil.

01:36:57.440 --> 01:36:59.440
You're 83 years old now.

01:36:59.440 --> 01:37:00.440
Do you still hate Pictionary.

01:37:00.440 --> 01:37:01.440
Yes.

01:37:01.440 --> 01:37:02.440
Oh.

01:37:02.440 --> 01:37:03.440
Okay.

01:37:03.440 --> 01:37:04.440
Yeah.

01:37:04.440 --> 01:37:08.440
Pictionary because because it's because the time limit.

01:37:08.440 --> 01:37:09.440
You know.

01:37:09.440 --> 01:37:12.440
And and people are shouting at you and stuff.

01:37:12.440 --> 01:37:13.440
I want to.

01:37:13.440 --> 01:37:15.440
If I'm going to draw something I want it to be good.

01:37:15.440 --> 01:37:18.440
And on my terms and I don't want somebody to go.

01:37:18.440 --> 01:37:20.440
Time's up.

01:37:20.440 --> 01:37:22.440
What is that.

01:37:22.440 --> 01:37:26.440
Well there's a crosshatching because of the shadows here and like that.

01:37:26.440 --> 01:37:27.440
But I don't even know.

01:37:27.440 --> 01:37:29.440
Couldn't you make it simpler.

01:37:29.440 --> 01:37:32.440
I mean it's it's can you dumb it down.

01:37:32.440 --> 01:37:35.440
Because it's it doesn't have to be good.

01:37:35.440 --> 01:37:36.440
I just need to know what it is.

01:37:36.440 --> 01:37:40.440
Why did you take so much time on the stem.

01:37:40.440 --> 01:37:42.440
Just draw.

01:37:42.440 --> 01:37:43.440
Just try to happen.

01:37:43.440 --> 01:37:44.440
I just don't know.

01:37:44.440 --> 01:37:47.440
It's just everybody gets all critical of you.

01:37:47.440 --> 01:37:52.440
When I could out fucking draw anybody in this room.

01:37:52.440 --> 01:37:54.440
Can't those both be true because.

01:37:54.440 --> 01:37:55.440
No.

01:37:55.440 --> 01:37:58.440
I think no one would agree that that's like an amazing Apple you're drawing.

01:37:58.440 --> 01:38:01.440
But at the same time in the terms of the constraints of the game.

01:38:01.440 --> 01:38:04.440
It probably is conducive to draw like a simpler Apple right.

01:38:04.440 --> 01:38:06.440
Yes that's why I hate Pictionary.

01:38:06.440 --> 01:38:07.440
Right.

01:38:07.440 --> 01:38:09.440
Because it doesn't value what you value about drawing.

01:38:09.440 --> 01:38:10.440
Right.

01:38:10.440 --> 01:38:11.440
Right.

01:38:11.440 --> 01:38:12.440
OK.

01:38:12.440 --> 01:38:17.440
And so there should be a game that I could play that you don't like.

01:38:17.440 --> 01:38:18.440
All right.

01:38:18.440 --> 01:38:19.440
Well.

01:38:19.440 --> 01:38:20.440
I want to play that.

01:38:20.440 --> 01:38:21.440
I want to play.

01:38:21.440 --> 01:38:24.440
I'm going to have to go on an airplane mode to do this.

01:38:24.440 --> 01:38:25.440
But I really want to play the.

01:38:25.440 --> 01:38:27.440
Are you going to turn into an airplane.

01:38:27.440 --> 01:38:28.440
No.

01:38:28.440 --> 01:38:29.440
No.

01:38:29.440 --> 01:38:30.440
I wanted to play the Dick and Morty trailer.

01:38:30.440 --> 01:38:31.440
Oh boy.

01:38:31.440 --> 01:38:32.440
I don't.

01:38:32.440 --> 01:38:33.440
But you know what I should have.

01:38:33.440 --> 01:38:35.440
I heard that his name is Rick in the.

01:38:35.440 --> 01:38:36.440
Wait a minute.

01:38:36.440 --> 01:38:37.440
No.

01:38:37.440 --> 01:38:38.440
It's just the title.

01:38:38.440 --> 01:38:39.440
Is it two dudes.

01:38:39.440 --> 01:38:41.440
No it's like an alien chick.

01:38:41.440 --> 01:38:42.440
I don't.

01:38:42.440 --> 01:38:43.440
That's already like.

01:38:43.440 --> 01:38:44.440
Well there's no way to get.

01:38:44.440 --> 01:38:46.440
Well how would you do a record.

01:38:46.440 --> 01:38:47.440
Two gay dudes.

01:38:47.440 --> 01:38:48.440
Yeah.

01:38:48.440 --> 01:38:49.440
Dick and Morty.

01:38:49.440 --> 01:38:51.440
There's a dick inside Morty.

01:38:51.440 --> 01:38:53.440
Dick and not Dick in.

01:38:53.440 --> 01:38:55.440
But Morty is pretty defined by.

01:38:55.440 --> 01:38:56.440
OK.

01:38:56.440 --> 01:38:57.440
Illegality.

01:38:57.440 --> 01:38:58.440
What.

01:38:58.440 --> 01:39:00.440
Age wise Morty is pretty defined.

01:39:00.440 --> 01:39:02.440
It'd be like if you did a Simpsons porn.

01:39:02.440 --> 01:39:04.440
Mark Bart and Lisa.

01:39:04.440 --> 01:39:05.440
In it.

01:39:05.440 --> 01:39:06.440
Oh yeah.

01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:07.440
Well I've seen that.

01:39:07.440 --> 01:39:09.440
You've seen a porn with Bart and Lisa.

01:39:09.440 --> 01:39:10.440
In it.

01:39:10.440 --> 01:39:11.440
Oh yeah.

01:39:11.440 --> 01:39:12.440
And it's depicting Bart and Lisa like.

01:39:12.440 --> 01:39:13.440
They're aged up.

01:39:13.440 --> 01:39:14.440
Usually.

01:39:14.440 --> 01:39:15.440
Characters get aged up.

01:39:15.440 --> 01:39:16.440
Oh OK.

01:39:16.440 --> 01:39:17.440
I didn't know about that.

01:39:17.440 --> 01:39:18.440
Because it's just a shitty.

01:39:18.440 --> 01:39:19.440
Animated.

01:39:19.440 --> 01:39:20.440
Yeah.

01:39:20.440 --> 01:39:21.440
Right.

01:39:21.440 --> 01:39:22.440
Well.

01:39:22.440 --> 01:39:23.440
No.

01:39:23.440 --> 01:39:24.440
No.

01:39:24.440 --> 01:39:25.440

01:39:26.440 --> 01:39:27.440
Like.

01:39:27.440 --> 01:39:28.440
No.

01:39:28.440 --> 01:39:29.440
I'm talking about.

01:39:29.440 --> 01:39:30.440
Porn hub.

01:39:30.440 --> 01:39:32.440
Universes would you think.

You don't want to see people painted in yellow.

01:39:52.440 --> 01:39:53.440
Body paint like that?

01:39:53.360 --> 01:39:57.760

Anyone to want to see this.

01:39:55.440 --> 01:39:57.440
Well that's what I'm saying.

01:39:57.440 --> 01:39:58.440

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:14.240
so I'm just gonna bring this up is that because I can't find this anywhere that if you're

01:40:14.240 --> 01:40:19.120
watching porn on an iPad there's these new redirect ads they always are trying to take

01:40:19.120 --> 01:40:23.800
your browser all over the place you can't watch porn anymore I can't find anything about

01:40:23.800 --> 01:40:28.080
online is no one else like putting up against this or is no one talking about it is this

01:40:28.080 --> 01:40:33.520
only happening to me no I well I have a porn hub premium yeah so if you're only on porn

01:40:33.520 --> 01:40:39.160
hub is like one of it never does it but you primarily use your iPad for porn well yeah

01:40:39.160 --> 01:40:43.880
I think most people primarily that when I worked at Apple that was like it's not you

01:40:43.880 --> 01:40:48.720
don't want to talk about it but most of the time you're looking at no no at Apple it turns

01:40:48.720 --> 01:40:53.000
out that everyone uses their iPad for like that's one of the main reasons people buy

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:58.200
iPads for porn viewing yeah to watch porn that's a weird choice because yeah not actually

01:40:58.200 --> 01:41:03.640
that much of a but it doesn't stand up on it so no it sure doesn't I will say like like

01:41:03.640 --> 01:41:10.680
if you're if you're just looking at photos if you the 10.5 inch iPad pro you could rub

01:41:10.680 --> 01:41:15.680

01:42:23.120 --> 01:42:27.840
it through the court you have whatever it goes fast he has it not whatever is the right way

01:42:27.840 --> 01:42:35.120
to do it but whatever happens okay so the trailer for the Rick and a Rick and Morty porn

01:42:35.120 --> 01:42:41.120
movie and it's not animated is people painted blue hairs we can't hear or I can't hear it

meth rocks that's unity comes through a portal that's unity comes through a portal ah I'm

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:30.720
a pickle take my bird looks like she's completely filled up and maybe you should take a look

01:43:30.720 --> 01:43:44.400
in the mirror so at one point in there they cut it it goes like yeah Beth he's talking

01:43:44.400 --> 01:43:56.640
about his daughter I didn't even need to see the visual no there's no wrong answers I don't

01:43:56.640 --> 01:44:00.880
know where I'm torn this is one of those things it's like oh five weeks from now five months

01:44:00.880 --> 01:44:06.360
from now five years from now you gotta go find I made it will I will I look back on these

01:44:06.360 --> 01:44:11.800
days when I considered it an innocent honor to express it's like this is what in my this

01:44:11.800 --> 01:44:16.800
is what I have been working for you in your whole life a community porno a Rick and Morty

01:44:16.800 --> 01:44:23.720
porno because yeah it's a it is a milestone there is no porno version of the pamphlet

01:44:23.720 --> 01:44:28.280
you're handing out door to door there's no porno version of the dishes you wash there's

01:44:28.280 --> 01:44:33.840
no porno versions there is porno versions of people if you if you if you permeate if

01:44:33.840 --> 01:44:38.960
you infiltrate the collective unconscious to a certain degree and no it's not that much

01:44:38.960 --> 01:44:44.360
it's not a sign of bravery or nobility or goodness it's simply a really clear milestone

01:44:44.360 --> 01:44:49.800
that like that like the idea of a porno version of a thing that you created well it's the

01:44:49.800 --> 01:44:55.320
reason that it's like it's like what we would always talk about with just like what you know

01:44:55.320 --> 01:44:59.840
creating icons and things like that is like if somebody could make a Halloween costume

01:44:59.840 --> 01:45:05.120
of your character you know it's very simple you know you've got like these very simple

01:45:05.120 --> 01:45:12.760
shapes you know blue hair spiky drool lab coat you're Rick okay and Morty short yellow

01:45:12.760 --> 01:45:19.600
hair oh geez yeah now make them fuck you got a porno right the easier it is the more likely

01:45:19.600 --> 01:45:23.480
it's gonna happen of course it needs to be popular to there's also kind of flattery it's

01:45:23.480 --> 01:45:26.880
like if you're if you're a kid in high school it just it just means you decided like you

01:45:26.880 --> 01:45:32.320
want I want to be the kid that puts on like I'm gonna get these big thick rimmed eyeglasses

01:45:32.320 --> 01:45:37.520
right and you're at the stein optical and if that exists and you get them and then you're

01:45:37.520 --> 01:45:43.280
wearing them you're like man a lot of people are giving me shit because now I'm the person

01:45:43.280 --> 01:45:47.120
that has like manhole covers on their face I got these big giant glasses but then the

01:45:47.120 --> 01:45:52.520
day that like you fantasize about if you're fantasizing about popularity or cultural like

01:45:52.520 --> 01:45:58.280
efficacy is like that that you know you're it's like so and so for class president and

01:45:58.280 --> 01:46:03.440
the and the drawing of your logo silhouette thing is like there's this big giant pair

01:46:03.440 --> 01:46:10.320
of glasses it's like I did it there's some kind of like local boy makes good like I'm

01:46:10.320 --> 01:46:17.320
in your I'm in your sex now yeah like I did like I was I was watching Mr. Rogers on your

01:46:17.320 --> 01:46:22.480
TV and then I went out to Los Angeles and I made a thing and I hit the bell and I got

01:46:22.480 --> 01:46:30.080
the cookie and it came all the way back around that it's like you're masturbating to it now

01:46:30.080 --> 01:46:36.440
yeah or it's like yeah it's being it's yeah I guess it's just it's just a like it's cool

01:46:36.440 --> 01:46:43.120
it's deeply deeply in ground yeah embedded in me but I definitely will like like a couple

01:46:43.120 --> 01:46:48.080
years from now I expect to learn that there's some reason that I'm not looking at why that's

01:46:48.080 --> 01:46:53.560
like somehow like as I'm recording that going like I'm so stoked about this this is so great

01:46:53.560 --> 01:46:57.200
how can this be wrong for anybody isn't this great if you don't like it don't watch it

01:46:57.200 --> 01:47:02.520
wow it's amazing and I'll be looking at myself saying that oh you dummy you didn't know

01:47:02.520 --> 01:47:08.120
but that's good that's good that you're not like oh years from now I'm going to be thinking

01:47:08.120 --> 01:47:13.120
of the exact same thing I'm thinking now that I mean like that's what I'm saying like hopefully

01:47:13.120 --> 01:47:19.280
you're changing like there's a theme to this episode aside from you said it's it's forgive

01:47:19.280 --> 01:47:26.120
yeah forgive the ignorant so that yeah and and and and be and admit your ignorance yeah

01:47:26.120 --> 01:47:33.040
don't get into an argument to win get into a discussion to understand like when you're

01:47:33.040 --> 01:47:40.480
in these Twitter arguments don't try to bury the other person and and if you if the person

01:47:40.480 --> 01:47:46.400
starts making you like realize oh yeah maybe what I was thinking was wrong be the bigger

01:47:46.400 --> 01:47:51.280
person and say yeah I guess you're right well I don't know about you but every time the other

01:47:51.280 --> 01:47:56.400
person says that I'm always like I'm always like all right got it like with few exceptions

01:47:56.400 --> 01:48:01.680
was the person like revved me up so much that I'm like well next time don't fuck around

01:48:01.680 --> 01:48:05.160
but mostly when so as soon as somebody goes like you know what I don't know what the fuck

01:48:05.160 --> 01:48:10.440
I'm talking about like I don't you know it kind of like drains the whole thing but anyway

01:48:10.440 --> 01:48:15.280
but I mean I think that I think that's a natural thing because when you get into these arguments

01:48:15.280 --> 01:48:19.120
you want to bury the other person finish eyes being right and it doesn't make sense because

01:48:19.120 --> 01:48:24.320
we're dumb people and not knowing shit is means that we're about to learn something

01:48:24.320 --> 01:48:28.040
and we think that that means we're about to have something taken from us and I'm speaking

01:48:28.040 --> 01:48:34.240
for myself and saying yeah that that if you're wrong you're dumb and no one wants to be called

01:48:34.240 --> 01:48:39.560
dumb but but what if you were smart now we just learned that you can be dumb and you

01:48:39.560 --> 01:48:43.520
could become in charge of all the nuclear weapons right like so no one's saying being

01:48:43.520 --> 01:48:51.920
dumb is bad you could not know shit and like run the world in fact you do so now everybody

01:48:51.920 --> 01:48:56.560
let's be dumb which means you don't already know what the fuck is going on so now you

01:48:56.560 --> 01:49:01.960
can be like sorry I don't understand I sorry about that I don't get it I'm I'm I don't

01:49:01.960 --> 01:49:07.600
know anything that I'm talking about you said Steinhoffels before do you guys know I said

01:49:07.600 --> 01:49:13.760
lens crafters but no you said Steinhoffel well you did not say that you said you said Steinhoffel

01:49:13.760 --> 01:49:19.920
let's see if you can admit you're wrong that you okay you never said Steinhoffels tonight

01:49:19.920 --> 01:49:24.680
I don't I don't think I did I think I said lens crafters did I say Steinhoffel it's on

01:49:24.680 --> 01:49:31.320
the or maybe I said okay I find out but anyway that's not my point tweet it Rob my my point

01:49:31.320 --> 01:49:38.520
is that's what I was gonna ask is that a Milwaukee that I said lens crafters Steinhoffel Steinhoffels

01:49:38.520 --> 01:49:45.280
and lens crafters were the two places you could buy glasses in Robin and my eyes hometown

01:49:45.280 --> 01:49:52.520
yeah Steinhoffel I thought I said one he thinks I said the other I guess you know what else

01:49:52.520 --> 01:49:58.880
was in our hometown and this is like on my curve at low this is a wonderful world of

01:49:58.880 --> 01:50:06.320
camera this is the best song ever and when I'm dead when I die at my funeral even though

01:50:06.320 --> 01:50:12.400
I'm gonna be cremated if you're gonna put me if you're gonna you know like Walter me

01:50:12.400 --> 01:50:19.560
and throw my ashes you know I'll unto the I want you to play this song while I'm well

01:50:19.560 --> 01:50:45.360
well well whatever you do it's a good song it's a world of cameras a world of film it's

01:50:45.360 --> 01:50:51.560
a world when you can be whatever you I can't find the extended version online so use your

01:50:51.560 --> 01:51:00.200
gremlins to go out there and find it because I would kill for the full microvelo I didn't

01:51:00.200 --> 01:51:04.080
know I was undercutting that I I was I thought I was making my own joke I didn't know you

01:51:04.080 --> 01:51:09.560
were gonna load that up on your phone well you teed me up because you sang the song and

01:51:09.560 --> 01:51:12.760
you're it's your show I didn't know for those listening I didn't know he was gonna pull

01:51:12.760 --> 01:51:19.880
that song out I'm just I'm just saying when I'm dead you know at the funeral which you

01:51:19.880 --> 01:51:28.080
know if you can make it make sure that that song plays you know just to send them home

01:51:28.080 --> 01:51:36.640
that's what I want I'm gonna okay well I hope Kate's keeping track cuz is it we're recording

01:51:36.640 --> 01:51:42.720
it too by the way is that in your living will it's not in my living will I mean my ashes

01:51:42.720 --> 01:51:49.520
are gonna be planted under a tree do you have the tree picked out no are you gonna do one

01:51:49.520 --> 01:51:54.080
of those life's life's pod things I'm thinking about doing that I'm thinking about because

01:51:54.080 --> 01:51:58.680
I think that would be better than cuz I saw Neil Neil deGrasse is like said I'm not gonna

01:51:58.680 --> 01:52:02.840
get cremated because you're just you're taking all your energy and you're dispelleted into

01:52:02.840 --> 01:52:08.600
the solar system and they don't need that what we want to do is bury ourselves into

01:52:08.600 --> 01:52:14.560
the ground man you know and give it to get energy back be a part of the world yeah but

01:52:14.560 --> 01:52:19.320
and this is so ill timed but I this is literally coming in over the facts I guess he hit he

01:52:19.320 --> 01:52:25.080
hits women I'm kidding okay all right all right sorry I thought it was true all right

01:52:25.080 --> 01:52:29.480
yeah it's a tough time you say that's why I guess that was my quote unquote John was

01:52:29.480 --> 01:52:35.200
like I must have missed that headline how would you know like yeah I don't think that's

01:52:35.200 --> 01:52:43.240
true no no it's not true it's not true it was a joke I don't know why you we don't know

01:52:43.240 --> 01:52:47.880
if it's not the evidence not it's like milkshake duck I don't know he's trying to make a joke

01:52:47.880 --> 01:52:53.200
milkshake duck yeah it turns out he's racist who's milkshake duck all right we don't have

01:52:53.200 --> 01:52:59.920
this milkshake duck I don't know we didn't do and that's probably for the best what did

01:52:59.920 --> 01:53:06.320
we learn yeah you don't want to talk to my wife why why would you like what do you mean

01:53:06.320 --> 01:53:11.640
what I don't know I said hey can I bring Kate along and you said absolutely and an exclamation

01:53:11.640 --> 01:53:17.200
point which is rare oh I didn't you I said because it's fine I mean I thought I didn't

01:53:17.200 --> 01:53:20.880
know you were taught we I didn't know it's fine it's fine on microphone I don't know

01:53:20.880 --> 01:53:29.120
we were talking about women's point of view it would have been great to have I didn't perceive

01:53:29.120 --> 01:53:34.200
that as I know we were having that misunderstanding I literally thought you meant because I was

01:53:34.200 --> 01:53:39.320
like popping in here to do this thing and then you thought you literally meant can you

01:53:39.320 --> 01:53:45.840
bring your wife with you as opposed to not being allowed to bring her with you like

01:53:45.840 --> 01:53:51.480
to come record the thing not can I bring her on the podcast because then when someone had

01:53:51.480 --> 01:53:55.320
asked should Levy be sitting in this chair the entire time I would have said no let's

01:53:55.320 --> 01:53:59.680
put Kate in that chair because I made an agreement you swap people out and have people I don't

01:53:59.680 --> 01:54:06.880
know I'm not I don't I'm not telling you how to run your show I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm giving

01:54:06.880 --> 01:54:13.240
light to the entire misunderstanding and I get it I get it I didn't I figured I I was

01:54:13.240 --> 01:54:18.640
like we're either gonna have a woman on here that we're gonna all like a sale with like

01:54:18.640 --> 01:54:25.200
points of view and questions or it's gonna be like dudes like talking about like our

01:54:25.200 --> 01:54:31.800
stake in it and to each other about it which and that I and to that end I had texted like

01:54:31.800 --> 01:54:36.520
for instance Emily Gordon on a Hail Mary because I thought she'd be like whatever and she was

01:54:36.520 --> 01:54:43.360
like yeah I'm I'm out of town it's like I'm plus where is she the New York why Camille

01:54:43.360 --> 01:54:51.120
was on it hosted SNL right went what day was that Saturday night live now sorry if anybody

01:54:51.120 --> 01:54:56.280
I'm sure Kate wasn't like all gussied up and ready to go but they also feel bad if anybody

01:54:56.280 --> 01:55:00.640
thought I didn't I didn't mean to create that misunderstanding no no I it's fine I mean it's

01:55:00.640 --> 01:55:08.880

01:55:39.360 --> 01:55:43.840
saying when he said can Kate come was that it makes sense to me now that's like yeah

01:55:43.840 --> 01:55:49.880
of course you're gonna be spending two hours apart from Rob I was in robbing Rob from their

01:55:49.880 --> 01:55:55.760

01:55:55.760 --> 01:56:07.040
of glass she would love to watch me be an idiot well I mean I don't know I was I was pretty

I decided I wanted to marry you I was told that's what love was you you what I should

01:56:47.840 --> 01:56:53.320
have I should have looked at it like you're you're a good singer I shouldn't have been

01:56:53.320 --> 01:57:05.280
like but I didn't I didn't approach you but going I I'm sorry to all my ex-girlfriends

01:57:05.280 --> 01:57:13.000

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:17.480
up like like in every step of the way like I've always been like I don't know I'm just

01:57:17.480 --> 01:57:23.920
doing a lot of reviewing and I think that I've I think I've been a bad bad person because

01:57:23.920 --> 01:57:30.080
I think that I have thought of women differently I think I think the same thing about me and

01:57:30.080 --> 01:57:37.120
I think it's it's good to acknowledge and move forward because every little piece of

01:57:37.120 --> 01:57:40.560
us we're all pallbearers of the same coffin and then just because there's like one dude

01:57:40.560 --> 01:57:46.280
that's like oh this guy climbed the Empire State Building and came into a airplane and

01:57:46.280 --> 01:57:51.360

01:58:02.800 --> 01:58:10.880
