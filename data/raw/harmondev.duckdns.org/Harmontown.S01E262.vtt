{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:10.000\nLadies and gentlemen, welcome to Downtown Burbank.\n\n00:10.000 --> 00:26.000\nHarmontown is now in session. Let's bring out Spencer Crittenden.\n\n00:26.000 --> 00:44.000\nAlright, to my right we have Steve Libby. And the mayor of Harmontown himself, Mr. Dan Harmon.\n\n00:44.000 --> 00:50.000\nThank you. Wow. Alright, welcome to the second episode that we've done in studio.\n\n00:50.000 --> 00:51.000\nI love it.\n\n00:51.000 --> 00:53.000\nThank you Rob Schrab, our guest comptroller.\n\n00:53.000 --> 00:54.000\nYou're welcome.\n\n00:54.000 --> 00:58.000\nSo we're streaming live now is the difference between this week and last week.\n\n00:58.000 --> 01:03.000\nSo now we're actually, even though we don't feel live, we are live.\n\n01:03.000 --> 01:12.000\nSo don't launch into one of your Zionist rants, Libby, about how certain people are owed certain land.\n\n01:12.000 --> 01:15.000\nIt's only going to get us in a lot of hot water.\n\n01:15.000 --> 01:30.000\nSo tonight I want to just talk about stuff which it feels weird to talk about anything because we're in a completely different medium.\n\n01:30.000 --> 01:33.000\nLike now you just hear your own voice and you feel like it feels more legitimate.\n\n01:33.000 --> 01:35.000\nIt feels like I'm a radio show host.\n\n01:35.000 --> 01:36.000\nYes.\n\n01:36.000 --> 01:44.000\nIt feels like I'm supposed to have a point of view or anything like that but I'm going to confine my points of view to myself like I'm always supposed to do.\n\n01:44.000 --> 01:45.000\nIt's a comedy podcast.\n\n01:45.000 --> 01:46.000\nIt is.\n\n01:46.000 --> 01:48.000\nI am a comedy podcast personality.\n\n01:48.000 --> 01:50.000\nPeople come here for the laughs.\n\n01:50.000 --> 01:53.000\nThe funny things, my point of view.\n\n01:53.000 --> 01:57.000\nThese are things that you've thought up and you're going to bring it to the attention of the audience.\n\n01:57.000 --> 01:58.000\nYeah.\n\n01:58.000 --> 02:01.000\nSo these are humorous items.\n\n02:01.000 --> 02:07.000\nBut I do think we're going to end up talking a lot about the Harvey Weinstein thing and the explosion that's resulting.\n\n02:07.000 --> 02:08.000\nWhat happened?\n\n02:08.000 --> 02:10.000\nI'll explain in a second.\n\n02:10.000 --> 02:15.000\nAll right. We should probably do some kind of title sequence for this segment, right?\n\n02:15.000 --> 02:16.000\nOh, the heart.\n\n02:16.000 --> 02:18.000\nYou want to skip right to that.\n\n02:18.000 --> 02:19.000\nThe headline item.\n\n02:19.000 --> 02:20.000\nYeah.\n\n02:20.000 --> 02:21.000\nOkay.\n\n02:21.000 --> 02:24.000\nHere comes Dan Harmon's Headlines.\n\n02:24.000 --> 02:26.000\nOh, this is the overview.\n\n02:26.000 --> 02:27.000\nYeah.\n\n02:27.000 --> 02:31.000\nWell, I keep biting my own lip and not in a sexy way.\n\n02:31.000 --> 02:32.000\nThat's one of the things that.\n\n02:32.000 --> 02:33.000\nWhich part?\n\n02:33.000 --> 02:34.000\nThe inside.\n\n02:34.000 --> 02:36.000\nLike right on the inside.\n\n02:36.000 --> 02:37.000\nDo you get cankers?\n\n02:37.000 --> 02:38.000\nDo you get cankers?\n\n02:38.000 --> 02:40.000\nI do now.\n\n02:40.000 --> 02:41.000\nIt's a self-created canker.\n\n02:41.000 --> 02:42.000\nThis is the headline.\n\n02:42.000 --> 02:46.000\nLet's not let the preview text go longer than two lines.\n\n02:46.000 --> 02:47.000\nBack it up.\n\n02:47.000 --> 02:48.000\nThat's number one.\n\n02:48.000 --> 02:50.000\nNumber two, Dick and Morty.\n\n02:50.000 --> 02:51.000\nOh, boy.\n\n02:51.000 --> 03:01.000\nI saw a trailer for Rick and Morty, Port and Perity, that I haven't even stopped to examine whether my feelings are good, bad, or anything.\n\n03:01.000 --> 03:02.000\nI'm just excited.\n\n03:02.000 --> 03:04.000\nIt's the best of both worlds.\n\n03:04.000 --> 03:05.000\nHow many?\n\n03:05.000 --> 03:15.000\nThe tangible nominal name recognition and basic physical resemblance to Rick and Morty.\n\n03:15.000 --> 03:18.000\nAnd then you have real people having sex.\n\n03:18.000 --> 03:23.000\nIt's truly what some weirdo who has a weird fetish for Rick and Morty would like.\n\n03:23.000 --> 03:29.000\nAnd not just, you know, in assholes interpretation of what one of those fans would like.\n\n03:29.000 --> 03:33.000\nWe're talking about this a lot longer than just a headline.\n\n03:33.000 --> 03:34.000\nOh, shit.\n\n03:34.000 --> 03:35.000\nMaybe like the rule guy.\n\n03:35.000 --> 03:36.000\nI'm sorry.\n\n03:36.000 --> 03:37.000\nThat was one item.\n\n03:37.000 --> 03:38.000\nRight?\n\n03:38.000 --> 03:39.000\nYeah.\n\n03:39.000 --> 03:40.000\nOkay.\n\n03:40.000 --> 03:42.000\nI watched my cousin Vinny and it kind of holds up in some ways.\n\n03:42.000 --> 03:43.000\nOkay.\n\n03:43.000 --> 03:44.000\nGood.\n\n03:44.000 --> 03:46.000\nThe Me Too Facebook thing.\n\n03:46.000 --> 03:50.000\nThat's kind of a related to the Weinstein thing.\n\n03:50.000 --> 03:52.000\nRose McGowan.\n\n03:52.000 --> 03:53.000\nMcGowan.\n\n03:53.000 --> 03:54.000\nWhether we should.\n\n03:54.000 --> 03:55.000\nComing and going.\n\n03:55.000 --> 03:58.000\nThat was one of my, is it Gowan or Gowan?\n\n03:58.000 --> 03:59.000\nI think it's Gowan.\n\n03:59.000 --> 04:00.000\nYeah, I think it's McGowan.\n\n04:00.000 --> 04:01.000\nAll right.\n\n04:01.000 --> 04:02.000\nRose McGowan.\n\n04:02.000 --> 04:07.000\nLet's have a big conversation about how we are and aren't supposed to say things.\n\n04:07.000 --> 04:09.000\nStarting with the word McGowan McGowan.\n\n04:09.000 --> 04:10.000\nBut that's all the same thing.\n\n04:10.000 --> 04:13.000\nThat, the Me Too Facebook thing and the Weinstein thing.\n\n04:13.000 --> 04:14.000\nThat's all the same topic.\n\n04:14.000 --> 04:15.000\nWhat's the Me Too Facebook thing?\n\n04:15.000 --> 04:16.000\nYeah.\n\n04:16.000 --> 04:17.000\nYou say Me Too.\n\n04:17.000 --> 04:18.000\nThat's something Cody told me about.\n\n04:18.000 --> 04:20.000\nBut if I start talking about it.\n\n04:20.000 --> 04:21.000\nOkay.\n\n04:21.000 --> 04:23.000\nWe're still in the title sequence.\n\n04:23.000 --> 04:27.000\nThen I wrote down power dynamics just because, but really isn't that the same thing?\n\n04:27.000 --> 04:30.000\nAnd then I wrote down the word, I wrote down the word sex worker.\n\n04:30.000 --> 04:33.000\nLet's start with that because that just has such a quick shuffle.\n\n04:33.000 --> 04:34.000\nSex worker.\n\n04:34.000 --> 04:39.000\nLet's call this segment, what did I miss?\n\n04:39.000 --> 04:45.000\nHow do you know when you're finished?\n\n04:45.000 --> 04:48.000\nThe word prostitute is problematic now, right?\n\n04:48.000 --> 04:49.000\nYeah.\n\n04:49.000 --> 04:55.000\nYou at home, I'm not doing a sarcastic bit where I'm like going like, you tell me exactly,\n\n04:55.000 --> 04:58.000\nbut that is what I'm doing, but I'm not doing it in parody.\n\n04:58.000 --> 05:04.000\nI'm being sincere and wanting to talk about words that into the radar that I don't know\n\n05:04.000 --> 05:08.000\nhow much longer than the word prostitute has been.\n\n05:08.000 --> 05:09.000\nIs it?\n\n05:09.000 --> 05:11.000\nOn the chopping block that I've been using it.\n\n05:11.000 --> 05:13.000\nWell, it's the oldest profession.\n\n05:13.000 --> 05:14.000\nWhat'd you say?\n\n05:14.000 --> 05:19.000\nIt's the oldest profession.\n\n05:19.000 --> 05:22.000\nIt's so, but there's the idea.\n\n05:22.000 --> 05:23.000\nWhat's problematic?\n\n05:23.000 --> 05:24.000\nWell, I don't know.\n\n05:24.000 --> 05:26.000\nI don't think that's any.\n\n05:26.000 --> 05:31.000\nI think sex worker is a more encompassing term that applies to more people, but I don't\n\n05:31.000 --> 05:34.000\nknow that prostitute is necessarily, I mean, it might be.\n\n05:34.000 --> 05:35.000\nWhat's the difference?\n\n05:35.000 --> 05:41.000\nWell, you could be, for instance, like a, I don't want to say a cam whore, but you could\n\n05:41.000 --> 05:47.000\nbe a cam model and that's not necessarily a prostitute, but it is sex work.\n\n05:47.000 --> 05:51.000\nIs adult film acting a sex worker?\n\n05:51.000 --> 05:58.000\nThey're not offended by being lumped in with, is it that we're knocking off?\n\n05:58.000 --> 06:01.000\nAre we merging the idea that sex work is sex work?\n\n06:01.000 --> 06:06.000\nBecause we want to not say, because it's too biblical and provincial probably to go.\n\n06:06.000 --> 06:13.000\nWell, your sex work involves really meaning it or something like, like we've been, we've\n\n06:13.000 --> 06:16.000\nbeen, it's these divisions that need to go probably as part of it.\n\n06:16.000 --> 06:21.000\nI think it's a prostitute is a, I mean, it's only one kind of sex work.\n\n06:21.000 --> 06:25.000\nAnd so if you're like, oh, you're just a prostitute and they're like, no, I'm a sex worker.\n\n06:25.000 --> 06:29.000\nThen it's like, you're kind of putting him in a more narrow box where they meet people\n\n06:29.000 --> 06:31.000\nand have sex with them when that might not be what's for sale.\n\n06:31.000 --> 06:36.000\nYou know, like even, like even a dominatrix might not just meet people and have sex with\n\n06:36.000 --> 06:38.000\nthem, but they're almost certainly a sex worker.\n\n06:38.000 --> 06:39.000\nYeah.\n\n06:39.000 --> 06:43.000\nI had an ex-girlfriend who worked, she worked as a, she never, she never touched anybody.\n\n06:43.000 --> 06:45.000\nShe was a, she, her job was to like whip guys in a dungeon.\n\n06:45.000 --> 06:50.000\nSomething happened to my microphone or my headphones or my ego and, and that I, and\n\n06:50.000 --> 06:51.000\nI can't hear myself.\n\n06:51.000 --> 06:52.000\nI can hear you.\n\n06:52.000 --> 06:53.000\nI can hear your fine.\n\n06:53.000 --> 06:54.000\nAll right.\n\n06:54.000 --> 06:56.000\nSo you can't hear your voice at all in your cans.\n\n06:56.000 --> 07:00.000\nIt's like, it's like drifting in and out now, like as if I'm subject to some kind of voice\n\n07:00.000 --> 07:02.000\nactivated network.\n\n07:02.000 --> 07:05.000\nMaybe you're, maybe you're losing your hearing.\n\n07:05.000 --> 07:06.000\nGreat.\n\n07:06.000 --> 07:07.000\nGreat.\n\n07:07.000 --> 07:10.000\nNow is the time to find out.\n\n07:10.000 --> 07:11.000\nAll right.\n\n07:11.000 --> 07:14.000\nSo it's like, it's, it's hard to have these conversations because I want to like, I can,\n\n07:14.000 --> 07:21.000\nI sound like what I know the bad guy in my head sounds like when I have potentially passive\n\n07:21.000 --> 07:25.000\naggressive conversations, which is not what I'm trying to do about the actual, I'm fascinated\n\n07:25.000 --> 07:28.000\nand I do welcome the evolution of language.\n\n07:28.000 --> 07:34.000\nI see, I don't, I'm not, I'm not a person that wants to caution against the slippery slope\n\n07:34.000 --> 07:37.000\nof modifying language, even though I was 20 years ago.\n\n07:37.000 --> 07:41.000\nLike now I look at it differently and I'm fascinated by it.\n\n07:41.000 --> 07:46.000\nThat's why I like having these conversations with like, like, like you, it's, it's not\n\n07:46.000 --> 07:53.000\nevery day that you, someone lets you know that a word you're using is like changing\n\n07:53.000 --> 07:56.000\nand it's like fashion, fashion ability.\n\n07:56.000 --> 07:57.000\nIs that how this started?\n\n07:57.000 --> 08:02.000\nYou were, you were saying, well, you know, these prostitutes and some of them went.\n\n08:02.000 --> 08:03.000\nYeah.\n\n08:03.000 --> 08:04.000\nI can't remember.\n\n08:04.000 --> 08:08.000\nAnd I'm not going to, it's not, it's not anecdote worthy that conversation.\n\n08:08.000 --> 08:09.000\nOkay.\n\n08:09.000 --> 08:10.000\nNot at all.\n\n08:10.000 --> 08:17.000\nIt's more like, it's, here's what, here's what kind of interests me about it is like,\n\n08:17.000 --> 08:23.000\nwe don't have a, we don't, we don't, we, how do you tell what, there's no newsletter\n\n08:23.000 --> 08:25.000\nand that's what the bad guys say.\n\n08:25.000 --> 08:29.000\nWell, you told me the rules like, and it's like, no, why don't you, why don't you fucking\n\n08:29.000 --> 08:35.000\nthink, but well, when was I supposed to think about that as opposed to salt, pepper and\n\n08:35.000 --> 08:38.000\nother words that I use completely unconsciously.\n\n08:38.000 --> 08:42.000\nAnd this ties into everything that we'll be talking about that isn't funny because it's\n\n08:42.000 --> 08:48.000\nnot a comedy podcast and I'm not being funny and I don't, why did the chicken do the thing?\n\n08:48.000 --> 08:50.000\nI don't know because he felt disempowered.\n\n08:50.000 --> 08:53.000\nI'm going to talk about whatever I want to talk about.\n\n08:53.000 --> 08:56.000\nI know that I keep doing this where I keep lashing out at a hypothetical audience and\n\n08:56.000 --> 08:58.000\nsaying that I hate you and you're like, we didn't hate you.\n\n08:58.000 --> 08:59.000\nWhy are you yelling at me?\n\n08:59.000 --> 09:04.000\nBut I do, I just like, if you're, right now, if you're judging me, you know who you are.\n\n09:04.000 --> 09:06.000\nI don't, I judge you back.\n\n09:06.000 --> 09:08.000\nI judge you harder.\n\n09:08.000 --> 09:09.000\nI judge you first.\n\n09:09.000 --> 09:10.000\nI don't like you.\n\n09:10.000 --> 09:11.000\nI don't like you.\n\n09:11.000 --> 09:12.000\nI don't, I never liked you.\n\n09:12.000 --> 09:15.000\nAnd me liking you means more than you not liking me.\n\n09:15.000 --> 09:16.000\nYou're done.\n\n09:16.000 --> 09:17.000\nYou lost.\n\n09:17.000 --> 09:18.000\nYou're at a crater.\n\n09:18.000 --> 09:19.000\nYou're not even a person.\n\n09:19.000 --> 09:24.000\nYou're a crater with shoes that just moves around wherever you stand identifies the point\n\n09:24.000 --> 09:26.000\nwhere I have, I have power over you.\n\n09:26.000 --> 09:27.000\nSo stop judging me.\n\n09:27.000 --> 09:28.000\nYou've been judged.\n\n09:28.000 --> 09:30.000\nI'm going to proceed with my podcast.\n\n09:30.000 --> 09:33.000\nI don't know if I'm going to be funny, political, what side I'm on.\n\n09:33.000 --> 09:38.000\nBut when I'm talking and when there's diarrhea coming out of my mouth that's doing good.\n\n09:38.000 --> 09:42.000\nAnd when it's doing bad, I just talk and it's become my job.\n\n09:42.000 --> 09:44.000\nI've given it to myself as a job.\n\n09:44.000 --> 09:47.000\nHere's how I feel tonight about the following things.\n\n09:47.000 --> 09:48.000\nSorry I said all that.\n\n09:48.000 --> 09:49.000\nNo.\n\n09:49.000 --> 09:50.000\nAll right.\n\n09:50.000 --> 09:51.000\nHere we go.\n\n09:51.000 --> 09:55.000\nSo topic, topic number one or descending order.\n\n09:55.000 --> 09:56.000\nWell, okay.\n\n09:56.000 --> 10:00.000\nMy therapist said, you know what's happening right now.\n\n10:00.000 --> 10:08.000\nMen, women, Weinstein, whatever the language arguments, everything what's happening right\n\n10:08.000 --> 10:12.000\nnow is a revolution of consciousness versus unconsciousness.\n\n10:12.000 --> 10:18.000\nSo all of the things that you're doing and saying and being without thinking about them,\n\n10:18.000 --> 10:25.000\nthat has become the new thing that we're recognizing as problematic.\n\n10:25.000 --> 10:31.000\nAnd what we're starting to put a higher value on and trying to create a society based on\n\n10:31.000 --> 10:34.000\nare the things that we're thinking about.\n\n10:34.000 --> 10:36.000\nSay that again.\n\n10:36.000 --> 10:41.000\nIt's consciousness versus unconsciousness.\n\n10:41.000 --> 10:42.000\nOkay.\n\n10:42.000 --> 10:46.000\nSo we've come out of an era of celebrating unconsciousness.\n\n10:46.000 --> 10:50.000\nCan you give me an example of the old era versus the new era?\n\n10:50.000 --> 10:56.000\nNot like the archetype of the narcissist being like kind of a hero.\n\n10:56.000 --> 10:57.000\nThat's the old way.\n\n10:57.000 --> 10:58.000\nYeah.\n\n10:58.000 --> 10:59.000\nOkay.\n\n10:59.000 --> 11:03.000\nWe're starting to, the narcissism is starting to be looked at.\n\n11:03.000 --> 11:11.000\nIt's not like anti-hero, cool, like, oh, you're another person that isn't thinking about\n\n11:11.000 --> 11:14.000\nanybody but themselves and you're sucking your thumb and stamping your feet.\n\n11:14.000 --> 11:19.000\nThat was pretty chic three and a half fiscal quarters ago socially.\n\n11:19.000 --> 11:22.000\nWe're just, the bubble has burst on that market.\n\n11:22.000 --> 11:27.000\nI'm putting words in my therapist's mouth because she's not thinking of things.\n\n11:27.000 --> 11:30.000\nI'm trying to figure it out.\n\n11:30.000 --> 11:31.000\nOkay.\n\n11:31.000 --> 11:36.000\nSo when I think narcissists, like in terms of like television and movie, I think it's\n\n11:36.000 --> 11:38.000\nlike somebody like Ted Danson in Cheers.\n\n11:38.000 --> 11:43.000\nIs that the old way or people are starting to, people used to think like, oh, that guy's\n\n11:43.000 --> 11:44.000\nlike a scoundrel.\n\n11:44.000 --> 11:45.000\nHe's an asshole.\n\n11:45.000 --> 11:47.000\nBut now is that person a hero or is it the opposite?\n\n11:47.000 --> 11:50.800\nI think we're starting to, we're starting to, that's gone out of fashion.\n\n11:50.800 --> 11:52.000\nIf you picked that character.\n\n11:52.000 --> 11:53.000\nOkay.\n\n11:53.000 --> 11:54.000\nThat's Jeff Wenger from Cheers.\n\n11:54.000 --> 11:55.000\nRight.\n\n11:55.000 --> 11:56.000\nThat's Larry David and Curb Your Enthusiasm.\n\n11:56.000 --> 11:57.000\nOkay.\n\n11:57.000 --> 11:58.000\nOkay.\n\n11:58.000 --> 11:59.000\nThis is everybody.\n\n11:59.000 --> 12:00.000\nRight.\n\n12:00.000 --> 12:01.000\nEverybody is now a-\n\n12:01.000 --> 12:06.000\nThis is all the funny, this is the funny from like for a long time.\n\n12:06.000 --> 12:07.000\nRight.\n\n12:07.000 --> 12:12.000\nAnd the new hero is like say, what, is there a new example?\n\n12:12.000 --> 12:14.000\nLike Jay Berischel?\n\n12:14.000 --> 12:22.000\nPeople who know themselves, people who are, I don't, you're, I know you're not doing anything,\n\n12:22.000 --> 12:25.000\nyou're not trying to do anything to me.\n\n12:25.000 --> 12:27.000\nNo, no, I'm trying to understand.\n\n12:27.000 --> 12:33.000\nI feel like you're tumbling me over into a whole like where I'm pitching you what's funny\n\n12:33.000 --> 12:34.000\nand what's not funny.\n\n12:34.000 --> 12:35.000\nNo, no, no, no, no.\n\n12:35.000 --> 12:39.000\nI just want to understand what you're, I'm a visual person.\n\n12:39.000 --> 12:41.000\nSo, you know, I just, I'm trying to follow you.\n\n12:41.000 --> 12:42.000\nI can back off.\n\n12:42.000 --> 12:43.000\nBack it up.\n\n12:43.000 --> 12:44.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n12:44.000 --> 12:48.000\nJust think, or let's, let's come back, let's think about ourselves for a second.\n\n12:48.000 --> 12:49.000\nOkay.\n\n12:49.000 --> 12:50.000\nAll right.\n\n12:50.000 --> 12:57.000\nSo, how much have you been thinking about what you actually feel like what you want to\n\n12:57.000 --> 13:01.000\nbe right and wrong and what you've stuff like for instance, you, in the time that I've\n\n13:01.000 --> 13:06.000\nknown you, you became like a animal person.\n\n13:06.000 --> 13:07.000\nYes.\n\n13:07.000 --> 13:13.000\nAnd that graduated from your love of your dog to not that I'm tracing your, your evolution.\n\n13:13.000 --> 13:17.000\nI'm just saying like, that's how I remember the events happening.\n\n13:17.000 --> 13:22.000\nAnd then there was a certain point where you, you became vegetarian or vegan and you became\n\n13:22.000 --> 13:27.000\nlike, you know, you don't, you think that you, you, you became guided by a new principle.\n\n13:27.000 --> 13:34.000\nYou, you, you, and it was based on you deciding for yourself that you don't want regardless\n\n13:34.000 --> 13:38.000\nof what you think is right for the world or what everyone should do.\n\n13:38.000 --> 13:42.000\nYou had to start with yourself and you had to go, I like animals.\n\n13:42.000 --> 13:44.000\nLike I don't want to hurt them.\n\n13:44.000 --> 13:45.000\nYes.\n\n13:45.000 --> 13:46.000\nAnd that changed about you.\n\n13:46.000 --> 13:47.000\nYeah.\n\n13:47.000 --> 13:50.000\nThat is, that is something that's a major change.\n\n13:50.000 --> 13:55.000\nSo what if, you know, like what if what's going on with the Weinstein thing is like a chance\n\n13:55.000 --> 14:05.000\nfor guys like me to, you know, have a similar level of inventory taking about our relationship\n\n14:05.000 --> 14:09.000\nwith women, which just equated them with food.\n\n14:09.000 --> 14:14.000\nBut it could be part of the point, but, but like, I have been, I don't know about you,\n\n14:14.000 --> 14:23.000\nbut I imagine every guy has been kind of like looking past the shoebox of what you're like,\n\n14:23.000 --> 14:25.000\nlike what is supposed to be happening.\n\n14:25.000 --> 14:29.000\nAnd then you've been checking in with like some lower gut, right?\n\n14:29.000 --> 14:30.000\nYeah.\n\n14:30.000 --> 14:37.000\nWell, I mean, just in terms of like in the last couple of years, like just I like Kate\n\n14:37.000 --> 14:42.000\nhas really helped me like see things that I haven't noticed before because it's been\n\n14:42.000 --> 14:48.000\nso normalized, you know, in terms of like entertainment and TV and just how people treat each other.\n\n14:48.000 --> 14:53.000\nAnd I'm blind to it because I'm the only person that I've ever been.\n\n14:53.000 --> 14:57.000\nAnd, you know, I have my own problem.\n\n14:57.000 --> 15:02.000\nSo, you know, like having Kate like kind of point things out to me, it starts being more\n\n15:02.000 --> 15:03.000\nand more aware.\n\n15:03.000 --> 15:08.000\nAnd then when things like this start happening, you know, the shit that's happening with\n\n15:08.000 --> 15:15.000\nwith Rose McGowan on Twitter and, you know, everybody coming out and just it's, it is,\n\n15:15.000 --> 15:22.000\nI do feel like, man, you know, why have I, I've been a part of the problem for my entire\n\n15:22.000 --> 15:23.000\nlife.\n\n15:23.000 --> 15:27.000\nYou've been going back through your whole life, haven't you, for the last couple of weeks?\n\n15:27.000 --> 15:28.000\nAbsolutely.\n\n15:28.000 --> 15:34.000\nThe same way when I went vegan, like, I mean, I went went that way because of absolute like\n\n15:34.000 --> 15:35.000\nguilt.\n\n15:35.000 --> 15:42.000\nAnd I've been such a like overzealous, you know, trying to find like that happy medium\n\n15:42.000 --> 15:48.000\nwhere I'm, you know, trying to tell people what I'm going through and why it happened\n\n15:48.000 --> 15:53.000\nand without, you know, putting people off, you know, which, which, you know, this is,\n\n15:53.000 --> 15:57.000\nyou know, what women, you know, you know, like, they're in that same position where\n\n15:57.000 --> 15:59.000\nthey're like, no, you got to listen to me.\n\n15:59.000 --> 16:01.000\nThis is what I'm going through.\n\n16:01.000 --> 16:03.000\nBut you don't want to be a buzzkill, a pain.\n\n16:03.000 --> 16:07.000\nNo one wants to hear anybody whine and complain about stuff like that.\n\n16:07.000 --> 16:08.000\nRight.\n\n16:08.000 --> 16:10.000\nWell, people don't want to feel guilty.\n\n16:10.000 --> 16:12.000\nThey don't want to feel uncomfortable and guilty.\n\n16:12.000 --> 16:15.000\nSo they avoid the conversation or they roll their eyes or they walk away.\n\n16:15.000 --> 16:19.000\nWe're all having conversations right now where we're catching ourselves and each other in\n\n16:19.000 --> 16:25.000\nat a rate of like, way, for me, way faster, more infractions per minute too, because that's\n\n16:25.000 --> 16:27.000\nthe topic that's being talked about.\n\n16:27.000 --> 16:35.000\nSo it's kind of like, it's like, one thing I want to say to my, my brother out there\n\n16:35.000 --> 16:42.000\nand bones is, why are you raising my niece on Facebook?\n\n16:42.000 --> 16:45.000\nI, I, I, I've never met her.\n\n16:45.000 --> 16:46.000\nAre you really that mad?\n\n16:46.000 --> 16:47.000\nI talked about you.\n\n16:47.000 --> 16:54.000\nThe, the, no, my actual brother, which is the public, but the, and the male half of that\n\n16:54.000 --> 17:00.000\npublic, like, I keep thinking to myself, I keep going, like, you know what, what we're\n\n17:00.000 --> 17:07.000\nwatching play out is, is this, there's this part of it that we own, which is the, the\n\n17:07.000 --> 17:14.000\neasy part, it's the, it's the not thinking about it part where, because don't you find\n\n17:14.000 --> 17:21.000\nyourself every day, like, like, is that like thinking something and then because you're\n\n17:21.000 --> 17:28.000\nold and rich and bored and tired, maybe like, let's get, let's give a break to our, our\n\n17:28.000 --> 17:34.000\ndream to up a 20 year old brethren who, because I just remember being a piece of fucking shit\n\n17:34.000 --> 17:36.000\nthe further back you go.\n\n17:36.000 --> 17:43.000\nSo I can't judge today's 23 year old because if I was a guest on this podcast at the age\n\n17:43.000 --> 17:53.000\nof 23, I as a 44 year old minus that awareness would, would like make a fucking huge show\n\n17:53.000 --> 17:57.000\nof telling him what a big dumb piece of shit he was and it wouldn't help him.\n\n17:57.000 --> 18:01.000\nIt's just, you know, it's like, you know, old people telling is like, why do you got\n\n18:01.000 --> 18:02.000\nto dress like that?\n\n18:02.000 --> 18:04.000\nWhy are you listening to that garbage music?\n\n18:04.000 --> 18:06.000\nIt's not real music or whatever.\n\n18:06.000 --> 18:11.000\nAnd, you know, it's just how, because they're new to the world and they're, they're trying\n\n18:11.000 --> 18:12.000\nout stuff.\n\n18:12.000 --> 18:17.000\nAnd there aren't any classes in any of this because you can't charge money for it effectively\n\n18:17.000 --> 18:19.000\nwithout becoming litigatable.\n\n18:19.000 --> 18:21.000\nIn other words, we don't have a culture.\n\n18:21.000 --> 18:26.000\nWe don't have, like, we used to, we make, we rightfully make fun of our forebears for\n\n18:26.000 --> 18:31.000\nhaving these, like, these horrible classes societies that, and part of it was, okay,\n\n18:31.000 --> 18:35.000\nhere's the book on whether a woman gets into an elevator first and all of this shit.\n\n18:35.000 --> 18:40.000\nAnd all of that stuff is rightfully, like, we spit on it, we wipe our asses with it.\n\n18:40.000 --> 18:41.000\nSo uncool.\n\n18:41.000 --> 18:43.000\nThe Fonz doesn't have that book.\n\n18:43.000 --> 18:48.000\nThe Fonz just does, it's all about like, that American value system of like, why would\n\n18:48.000 --> 18:53.000\nyou ever, why would you have a rule book for interacting with blah, blah, blah?\n\n18:53.000 --> 18:56.000\nIt's great that we threw that in the furnace and all that stuff.\n\n18:56.000 --> 19:05.600\nAnd then now you have this thing of like, wait, you mean being 15 years old and not having\n\n19:05.600 --> 19:14.360\never any conversations about what we're supposed to be doing and what's going on in any fucking\n\n19:14.360 --> 19:19.600\nway that me, that drives all of society, like, oh, you mean I should just, I'll just figure\n\n19:19.600 --> 19:24.440\nthat shit out and part of it will be owned by my parents and that'll be owned by what\n\n19:24.440 --> 19:29.400\ncity or state they live in and that'll be whatever high school I went to, subdivisions,\n\n19:29.400 --> 19:34.000\nwhat base I am, what class I am, what income bracket, what, there was a freeway within\n\n19:34.000 --> 19:38.760\n50 yards of me or a power line, it's like, how is that shit?\n\n19:38.760 --> 19:46.600\nSo like, we done fucked up in one regard, like, we don't have training.\n\n19:46.600 --> 19:47.600\nWe're not telling kids.\n\n19:47.600 --> 19:50.880\nWe have movies and TV, that's our only training.\n\n19:50.880 --> 19:51.880\nSex ed classes.\n\n19:51.880 --> 19:58.040\nBut that's not interaction, you know, what we, I mean, physical interaction.\n\n19:58.040 --> 20:00.560\nLet's just put, like, why are you arguing?\n\n20:00.560 --> 20:02.400\nI don't know what you guys are arguing.\n\n20:02.400 --> 20:05.040\nRight, right, no, you're policing absolute statements.\n\n20:05.040 --> 20:10.640\nI'm expressing a point which is, we're in a mire of non-education about how to interact\n\n20:10.640 --> 20:11.640\nwith each other.\n\n20:11.640 --> 20:17.920\nI don't, I think, I think in today in 2017, sex ed classes are maybe more robust than they've\n\n20:17.920 --> 20:18.920\never been.\n\n20:18.920 --> 20:19.920\nOkay.\n\n20:19.920 --> 20:20.920\nBut, but, so, okay.\n\n20:20.920 --> 20:23.920\nSo Spencer's argument is that today's society has gotten, so, okay.\n\n20:23.920 --> 20:28.000\nI don't think there used to be conversations on consent back in the past.\n\n20:28.000 --> 20:29.000\nAll right.\n\n20:29.000 --> 20:33.880\nSo, so, so, right now, what you're saying is the problem has been solved.\n\n20:33.880 --> 20:39.880\nNo, I don't, I'm saying there are discussions, I mean, like in classrooms, you're saying\n\n20:39.880 --> 20:40.880\nthat there's not.\n\n20:40.880 --> 20:41.880\nNope.\n\n20:41.880 --> 20:42.880\nI think there are.\n\n20:42.880 --> 20:43.880\nOkay.\n\n20:43.880 --> 20:44.880\nI think there's an issue.\n\n20:44.880 --> 20:51.640\nI'm not going to be able to, yeah, a lot of, nothing I say for the next 40 to 60 minutes\n\n20:51.640 --> 20:53.760\nis going to actually be factual.\n\n20:53.760 --> 20:54.760\nOkay.\n\n20:54.760 --> 20:55.760\nOkay.\n\n20:55.760 --> 20:56.760\nI'm pretending.\n\n20:56.760 --> 20:59.520\nI'm making pretends.\n\n20:59.520 --> 21:07.280\nThe, so, we don't have, we have no sexual culture in our, in modern society.\n\n21:07.280 --> 21:09.760\nWe are, we are mystifying it.\n\n21:09.760 --> 21:17.120\nWe are telling each other in random combinations that it's, it's up to you, be yourself, like,\n\n21:17.120 --> 21:23.240\noh, it's nature, it's nurture, we don't, we are, we are, it is a fundamental thing about\n\n21:23.240 --> 21:28.200\nus, the way that we interact with each other, and it is the most mystical thing.\n\n21:28.200 --> 21:32.600\nIt's the thing that we just let be adrift, because the alternative would be to have rules\n\n21:32.600 --> 21:39.640\nfor that shit, which we interpret as being like a horrible idea, because of the culture\n\n21:39.640 --> 21:44.120\nthat we've come from, where there were a lot of rules for that shit.\n\n21:44.120 --> 21:46.200\nSo what do we do?\n\n21:46.200 --> 21:51.000\nHow do we combat that without going hierarchical, without going, having the pendulum swing back?\n\n21:51.000 --> 21:53.040\nThe only answer is just communication.\n\n21:53.040 --> 21:59.520\nIt's just a, it's a, it's everybody saying, when you hear something, when you see something,\n\n21:59.520 --> 22:04.800\nthen like, we have to like, figure out how we actually feel about it, because when we\n\n22:04.800 --> 22:09.320\nkeep talking to each other about it, like, we keep, we keep doing wrong.\n\n22:09.320 --> 22:16.320\nI think we've created like a, a culture for instance, to use the women thing that is going\n\n22:16.320 --> 22:20.920\non right now, a culture of silence, that we can contribute without even knowing it.\n\n22:20.920 --> 22:24.720\nSo how many times, I mean, like, we don't have to play some weird confession game, but\n\n22:24.720 --> 22:31.400\nlike, how complicit do you feel, like, when you see that stuff, you go like, yeah, you\n\n22:31.400 --> 22:39.280\nknow what, I, yeah, I, I, I, I, it gets frustrating because I look back at high school and, and\n\n22:39.280 --> 22:45.240\nwhere we were, nobody sits down and tells you how to interact with people.\n\n22:45.240 --> 22:51.440\nYou know, men, women, you know, young, old, they don't sit you down and you, you're just\n\n22:51.440 --> 22:55.120\nkind of thrown into the woods and you got to figure it out on your own.\n\n22:55.120 --> 23:00.600\nAnd so you get like all these beta males who are, you know, like weaker or not as confident.\n\n23:00.600 --> 23:05.440\nAnd then they, they get into these positions of power and they still don't know how to deal\n\n23:05.440 --> 23:07.360\nwith people and they don't know how to deal with women.\n\n23:07.360 --> 23:13.880\nYou also think, and I'm speaking for myself, you think as a nerd that there's like this\n\n23:13.880 --> 23:19.240\nmythology you're following from our generation, let's be specific about that, like, and speaking\n\n23:19.240 --> 23:20.240\nfor myself.\n\n23:20.240 --> 23:26.600\nIt's like, oh yeah, like if you're a nerd, then you can compensate, you can become the\n\n23:26.600 --> 23:31.340\njock of having, of being a nerd with power, with money, with something to offer.\n\n23:31.340 --> 23:32.840\nThat's what happened with Weinstein, I think.\n\n23:32.840 --> 23:38.880\nAnd it gets translated into sex somewhere in your workflow, unless you're blessed enough\n\n23:38.880 --> 23:45.040\nto be, yeah, like neurologically asexual, like if you, if, if, if they, it somehow gets\n\n23:45.040 --> 23:51.280\ntied in because there's no conversation about where I have abused my power dynamic at work.\n\n23:51.280 --> 23:54.160\nI, I, I didn't know I was doing it when I did it.\n\n23:54.160 --> 24:01.240\nI, I didn't, I never took notice that I never thought to myself until after the whole thing\n\n24:01.240 --> 24:05.280\nhappened and I looked back and was like, why was that such a relative disaster?\n\n24:05.280 --> 24:13.760\nOh, because if you have a crush on someone that works for you, you are not, it's not\n\n24:13.760 --> 24:20.280\nthe same as having a crush on someone at a library or a bar that doesn't work for you.\n\n24:20.280 --> 24:21.520\nYou fucking idiot.\n\n24:21.520 --> 24:22.520\nYeah.\n\n24:22.520 --> 24:29.960\nI, but I don't, it's like, that is happening on every block in every, and then in our industry\n\n24:29.960 --> 24:34.720\nthat's like, because you, like, we're not, we're not going like, okay, I, oh shit.\n\n24:34.720 --> 24:36.920\nUh, I have a crush on Stacy.\n\n24:36.920 --> 24:42.440\nUh, I wonder, I bet, I should just see if she wants to go to that thing or whatever.\n\n24:42.440 --> 24:47.440\nAnd you're not, who's going to stop and ask themself, oh, am I really giving Stacy the\n\n24:47.440 --> 24:54.160\nopportunity to, um, not be interested in going to see a movie with me and also continuing\n\n24:54.160 --> 24:59.920\nto know whether or not she's good at being a writer or whether, like, you don't, like,\n\n24:59.920 --> 25:06.640\nthere is no, there was no, um, but you're going on Batman, the ride sign and line that\n\n25:06.640 --> 25:15.080\nI waited in documentation, I, I found, I, I got that into my head by doing it wrong.\n\n25:15.080 --> 25:19.920\nI did it wrong and I'm really ashamed of it when I look back on it.\n\n25:19.920 --> 25:27.720\nFortunately for me, I'm not like, like, I, I, I, like, I, like, I never, it's just like,\n\n25:27.720 --> 25:28.720\nthat's part of that nerd thing.\n\n25:28.720 --> 25:33.880\nYeah, but I know, I never did anything and then, uh, like, but that doesn't matter.\n\n25:33.880 --> 25:37.520\nIt's like, like, the problem exists on the root level of your brain is like, what if you\n\n25:37.520 --> 25:39.640\ncould have done something?\n\n25:39.640 --> 25:41.560\nWhat if you could have gotten your way?\n\n25:41.560 --> 25:42.560\nYou could have.\n\n25:42.560 --> 25:43.560\nYou could have.\n\n25:43.560 --> 25:44.560\nYou could have.\n\n25:44.560 --> 25:48.200\nYou only knew, you only know at the time, like, that you, what you want.\n\n25:48.200 --> 25:51.840\nAnd then we're, and then you're used to thinking of yourself as an underdog and you go like,\n\n25:51.840 --> 25:57.040\nwell, I, like that in the movies and the TV shows, it's like, oh, the guy that uses everything\n\n25:57.040 --> 26:01.320\nhe's got going for him to turn things around with a special lady.\n\n26:01.320 --> 26:03.120\nIt's like, because you don't play sports.\n\n26:03.120 --> 26:07.400\nYou're not going to, you know, I'm not going to be a date rapist because I'm the underdog.\n\n26:07.400 --> 26:08.400\nI'm the, I'm the guy.\n\n26:08.400 --> 26:10.400\nWell, I'm never going to be wearing a polo shirt.\n\n26:10.400 --> 26:11.720\nI'm never going to be wearing a mask.\n\n26:11.720 --> 26:13.200\nThey're never, they'll never be on my yacht.\n\n26:13.200 --> 26:14.720\nI'll never date rape anyone.\n\n26:14.720 --> 26:15.720\nSure.\n\n26:15.720 --> 26:16.720\nYeah.\n\n26:16.720 --> 26:17.720\nEvery, when we, yeah.\n\n26:17.720 --> 26:20.640\nSo, well, I'm not, I'm not lecturing anybody watching or listening.\n\n26:20.640 --> 26:21.720\nI'm, I'm talking to myself.\n\n26:21.720 --> 26:29.400\nI just want, I was eager to, when we saw that Terry Crews thing on Twitter, like, I, like,\n\n26:29.400 --> 26:38.840\nlike, I fucking like, I'm in, I'm in a post Terry Crews six tweet thread Harmon Soul.\n\n26:38.840 --> 26:44.720\nAnd it's not because of what it's not, it's because of what I realized about myself when\n\n26:44.720 --> 26:46.360\nI read that thing.\n\n26:46.360 --> 26:55.040\nBecause I read through it and Terry Crews is a gigantic, physically fit, like, charming\n\n26:55.040 --> 27:01.360\nalpha beyond alpha dude who's just saying, yeah, one time I went to a party and my drunk\n\n27:01.360 --> 27:05.080\nboss came up to me and grabbed my nuts and there was nothing I could do about it.\n\n27:05.080 --> 27:07.080\nAnd I was all bummed out and I froze.\n\n27:07.080 --> 27:08.640\nAnd then I was like, what the fuck was that?\n\n27:08.640 --> 27:13.520\nAnd my wife was like, don't do anything about it because if you do what, what do you gain\n\n27:13.520 --> 27:14.680\nversus what do you lose?\n\n27:14.680 --> 27:15.680\nBlah, blah, blah.\n\n27:15.680 --> 27:16.680\nI'm not.\n\n27:16.680 --> 27:20.960\nI just put words in Terry Crews' wife's mouth that I paraphrased that, but that was like\n\n27:20.960 --> 27:21.960\na conversation.\n\n27:21.960 --> 27:22.960\nBut that was the party.\n\n27:22.960 --> 27:26.960\nShe wasn't like Lady Macbeth of the Matrix going like, oh, what have you got to lose by\n\n27:26.960 --> 27:28.840\nacquiescing to the nut grabbing?\n\n27:28.840 --> 27:29.840\nNo.\n\n27:29.840 --> 27:37.680\nBut his point was he froze and was like, like, and then it happened.\n\n27:37.680 --> 27:40.680\nAnd then, and then he didn't talk about it, et cetera.\n\n27:40.680 --> 27:46.280\nSo his point was if I can be a victim and Matt, you know, now are you listening and\n\n27:46.280 --> 27:47.280\na point well taken?\n\n27:47.280 --> 27:53.400\nBut the reason why I am shattered to the core by that story is because I read it and the\n\n27:53.400 --> 28:00.600\nentire time I'm reading it, I'm going no way or like, I want to read that differently.\n\n28:00.600 --> 28:04.280\nThat's this is the important thing is that I'm going, I'm like, I'm reading the Terry\n\n28:04.280 --> 28:14.400\nCrews thing and I'm going no way that's and if and then realizing that why is that story?\n\n28:14.400 --> 28:16.760\nLike is it more believable to me?\n\n28:16.760 --> 28:22.280\nIt's less believable narratively, which makes it for good storytelling.\n\n28:22.280 --> 28:25.480\nOh, no way.\n\n28:25.480 --> 28:27.560\nJack went up a beanstalk.\n\n28:27.560 --> 28:28.760\nWow.\n\n28:28.760 --> 28:29.760\nNo way.\n\n28:29.760 --> 28:32.720\nTerry Crews got got sexually assaulted.\n\n28:32.720 --> 28:39.360\nIt's a simultaneous expression of disbelief and I'm, I'm all over it and I'm so invested\n\n28:39.360 --> 28:43.320\nand I have not, I like, yeah, awesome.\n\n28:43.320 --> 28:47.240\nLike not awesome that it happened, but like, no way are you fucking kidding me when we\n\n28:47.240 --> 28:54.560\nexpress incredulity skepticism and I was like, wait, how is this different from like, I don't\n\n28:54.560 --> 29:01.440\nknow how I caught myself, but imagining that any woman, any woman, 240 pound black muscle\n\n29:01.440 --> 29:03.160\nbound woman doesn't really matter.\n\n29:03.160 --> 29:08.680\nLike, like, like, I don't think I just picturing just, okay, change his gender, just change\n\n29:08.680 --> 29:11.840\nTerry Crews to a woman.\n\n29:11.840 --> 29:19.440\nAnd I was like, I, I, I'm rattling with the realization that there was like a clear difference\n\n29:19.440 --> 29:26.000\nfor me that that when a woman, when I hear about a woman being like having this crazy\n\n29:26.000 --> 29:35.360\nshit happen to her, uh, it, I have some kind of like force field that it just needs to,\n\n29:35.360 --> 29:36.360\nthere's just a little checkpoint.\n\n29:36.360 --> 29:37.840\nThat's just, there's no big deal.\n\n29:37.840 --> 29:40.400\nI just need to see your ID before you get on the plane.\n\n29:40.400 --> 29:41.640\nThat's no big deal.\n\n29:41.640 --> 29:43.400\nEveryone can get on a plane.\n\n29:43.400 --> 29:47.880\nThere's a fucking checkpoint there that I saw where I was like, I, I, I, it wasn't placed\n\n29:47.880 --> 29:48.880\nthere consciously.\n\n29:48.880 --> 29:50.040\nI do not choose.\n\n29:50.040 --> 29:51.120\nI was not choosing.\n\n29:51.120 --> 29:52.200\nI never chose.\n\n29:52.200 --> 29:53.920\nI never knew.\n\n29:53.920 --> 29:58.840\nThat's why I was shook to the fucking core because I was like, the fuck is your problem?\n\n29:58.840 --> 30:04.200\nAnd then I started, you found it, you found it less believable or less when a woman tells\n\n30:04.200 --> 30:10.080\nme a story when in the past, when a woman has told me a story, whether it's not one\n\n30:10.080 --> 30:13.840\nof she's coming to me as an employer and say, whatever, when it gets official and all that\n\n30:13.840 --> 30:18.360\nstuff, equally important conversation about what we do in the workplace, not stuff.\n\n30:18.360 --> 30:27.440\nI'm talking about when a woman is confiding in you that some, something insane happened\n\n30:27.440 --> 30:34.040\nto her at the hands of a predator in the moment.\n\n30:34.040 --> 30:38.520\nSome of these, these seconds, Terry Cruz's story is three and a half seconds long, really.\n\n30:38.520 --> 30:44.000\nSix tweets, three and a half seconds, drunk boss in the middle of everyone at the, I'm\n\n30:44.000 --> 30:50.080\nassuming I pictured on a dance floor, it really doesn't matter, but anyways, but like, like\n\n30:50.080 --> 30:57.560\nthese stories, like I in my head, I look back over my whole life and I, it's not, it's not\n\n30:57.560 --> 31:00.600\nas simple as I believe women less.\n\n31:00.600 --> 31:07.640\nI think the irony is that it has something to do with this chivalry, you're in charge.\n\n31:07.640 --> 31:12.560\nThat's why they're telling you in the first place, you're, you're, you have to decide\n\n31:12.560 --> 31:17.160\nwhen Terry Cruz tells me a guy grabbed his nuts at a party, I don't have to decide what\n\n31:17.160 --> 31:18.600\nto do about it.\n\n31:18.600 --> 31:21.500\nI don't have to, I'm not in charge of whether it's true.\n\n31:21.500 --> 31:23.880\nSo I just fucking believe it.\n\n31:23.880 --> 31:28.760\nAnd my immediate reaction is, well, let's not work with that guy ever again.\n\n31:28.760 --> 31:33.920\nAnd I look back through my life and I'm realizing that like women saying like, you know, that\n\n31:33.920 --> 31:39.840\nguy on the corner, not work related, like whatever, your neighbor or this, this happened\n\n31:39.840 --> 31:44.320\nto me or that waiter at that restaurant, we were getting scrambled eggs and then he\n\n31:44.320 --> 31:46.360\nsaid this or that.\n\n31:46.360 --> 31:48.880\nAnd I have the same verbal outward reaction.\n\n31:48.880 --> 31:51.000\nSo no one can police it.\n\n31:51.000 --> 31:54.000\nI go, no way.\n\n31:54.000 --> 31:59.280\nBut I, when I read the Terry Cruz thing, I was like, I saw like, I don't care if you\n\n31:59.280 --> 32:04.400\ncall it a nanometer or a millimeter or a foot or 20 yards, a difference.\n\n32:04.400 --> 32:06.200\nI have a different setting.\n\n32:06.200 --> 32:08.560\nI think it's because we're supposed to be cowboys.\n\n32:08.560 --> 32:14.080\nI said, like, like, like, we're like, okay, now Stacy, no, no, just, just give me one\n\n32:14.080 --> 32:16.400\nsecond to take that in.\n\n32:16.400 --> 32:20.120\nThat's interesting that you're saying because if I go up to Arnold, the bus boy at Grand\n\n32:20.120 --> 32:25.200\nBuffet and punch him out, like that's all the unspoken stuff is like, yeah, no one\n\n32:25.200 --> 32:28.560\nasked you to do anything except believe them.\n\n32:28.560 --> 32:32.560\nAnd that, but you're already in this like Fonzie mode of like, now hold on, are you\n\n32:32.560 --> 32:37.840\ntrying to use my Fonzie strength to, you're not going to do anything anyway.\n\n32:37.840 --> 32:41.160\nBut like, your brain is like, my brain has been wired.\n\n32:41.160 --> 32:42.160\nWhat happened?\n\n32:42.160 --> 32:43.160\nNothing.\n\n32:43.160 --> 32:44.160\nOh.\n\n32:44.160 --> 32:45.160\nAll right.\n\n32:45.160 --> 32:51.800\nWell, anyways, but I think that's an interesting point that that that when a guy says, oh,\n\n32:51.800 --> 32:56.320\nthis happened to me, you go, oh, wow, and you don't feel responsible, but like, if a\n\n32:56.320 --> 33:02.400\nwoman says something to you, you part of it, I mean, like, I used to get mad, I go, like,\n\n33:02.400 --> 33:05.720\nnow I am, you want me to beat this person up?\n\n33:05.720 --> 33:06.720\nYeah.\n\n33:06.720 --> 33:08.320\nI suppose, are you sure?\n\n33:08.320 --> 33:11.640\nBecause I got, I don't want to, I don't want to get into rack with something.\n\n33:11.640 --> 33:17.760\nI don't, I'm not good at what it just, it all becomes like, ooh, this hurts me when\n\n33:17.760 --> 33:18.760\na crisis happened.\n\n33:18.760 --> 33:23.200\nSomebody else is like, look, no, just believe me and comfort me.\n\n33:23.200 --> 33:24.200\nSo yeah.\n\n33:24.200 --> 33:26.200\nAnd trace it back to like Terry Cruz.\n\n33:26.200 --> 33:29.200\nIt's like, it's like, he's not asking you to do anything.\n\n33:29.200 --> 33:30.200\nYeah.\n\n33:30.200 --> 33:35.040\nThat's a, and then if you said that to women, then they would go, I wasn't, I wanted you\n\n33:35.040 --> 33:36.040\nto believe me.\n\n33:36.040 --> 33:37.040\nYeah.\n\n33:37.040 --> 33:44.480\nIt's, it's, and I, oh, I, I, I, well, I believe is something I do before I do nothing that\n\n33:44.480 --> 33:49.960\nthank you, that is, look, I'm not, if you're watching or listening, I'm not, I'm not preaching\n\n33:49.960 --> 33:50.960\nto you.\n\n33:50.960 --> 33:51.960\nYou're different than me.\n\n33:51.960 --> 34:01.400\nI think that like, like, we have to, if you're listening to me, like, like start, like, nothing\n\n34:01.400 --> 34:02.880\nbad can happen to you.\n\n34:02.880 --> 34:06.160\nI am not going to be taken up to an electric chair at a mountain tomorrow.\n\n34:06.160 --> 34:09.560\nI'm not going to be exposed in a Mel Gibsonian way.\n\n34:09.560 --> 34:15.720\nI am, I am however, confessing to you that like, like something that is fundamental to\n\n34:15.720 --> 34:22.880\nall of this, that like the, the more innocent you are of any crime at all, the more important\n\n34:22.880 --> 34:27.040\nit is that you have this conversation with yourself, right?\n\n34:27.040 --> 34:32.680\nYou know, this week, like, like, because I'm saying that to, and I'm saying that to you\n\n34:32.680 --> 34:37.600\nin the same way I would say, cut out carbs or fucking like, drink less or something like\n\n34:37.600 --> 34:45.240\nthat I had discovered, like, like, I think this is the time and it is not because I know\n\n34:45.240 --> 34:46.440\nbetter than you.\n\n34:46.440 --> 34:54.160\nIt is because I, like, I'm going like, shit, you guys, like, like, like, we, we, we have\n\n34:54.160 --> 34:59.760\nthe capacity to do things that we don't know we're doing and, and we, like, we are going\n\n34:59.760 --> 35:04.240\nto benefit as brothers, we're not going to be less masculine and we're not going to be\n\n35:04.240 --> 35:07.600\nless cool and we're not going to make less of a paycheck.\n\n35:07.600 --> 35:14.040\nLike there will be no real world consequences, even amongst each other, if we, if we push\n\n35:14.040 --> 35:22.280\ntoward it being fashionable to not create a divider in between the conversations that\n\n35:22.280 --> 35:26.040\nwe have with ourselves, each other and, and with women.\n\n35:26.040 --> 35:29.720\nIt's been nice, like, this summer camp thing for me for a while, like, there's a lake in\n\n35:29.720 --> 35:34.920\nbetween the boys camp and the girls camp and it's very fun, the idea, like, and with that\n\n35:34.920 --> 35:41.960\ncomes panty raids and, which is awful, which is terrible.\n\n35:41.960 --> 35:46.280\nAll of the shit from our 80s movies, it's all awful, it's fun for the guys, but it's\n\n35:46.280 --> 35:52.000\nlike you've just broken into our place and started going through our personal items and\n\n35:52.000 --> 35:58.760\ntaking them away from us and, and we don't, we can't do anything about it.\n\n35:58.760 --> 36:02.360\nBut here's the logic circuit that gets triggered in you when we, when we talk about this stuff,\n\n36:02.360 --> 36:05.080\nbecause I know it gets triggered in me.\n\n36:05.080 --> 36:07.800\nIt's like, oh, what are you suggesting?\n\n36:07.800 --> 36:09.040\nWhat are you proposing?\n\n36:09.040 --> 36:10.360\nWhat are we supposed to do?\n\n36:10.360 --> 36:14.520\nSo I'm supposed to do this, but if we do that, but if everyone does this, but what about\n\n36:14.520 --> 36:15.520\nthat?\n\n36:15.520 --> 36:16.520\nStop.\n\n36:16.520 --> 36:22.600\nLike it is not, there is no invitation here and no command and no lecture.\n\n36:22.600 --> 36:23.920\nIt is a tag cloud.\n\n36:23.920 --> 36:29.000\nIt is tagging something and becoming more aware of it, making it more organisable.\n\n36:29.000 --> 36:36.880\nI myself, Dan Harmon, with no expectation of anyone else and no prediction of, of what\n\n36:36.880 --> 36:37.880\nwill happen.\n\n36:37.880 --> 36:44.760\nAnd with no observation about how society works, I am saying, and I feel like from my\n\n36:44.760 --> 36:51.200\npull of one here with my best friend that we're all in it right now.\n\n36:51.200 --> 36:55.960\nLike I am saying, as one of you having that conversation in his head, like, like all we\n\n36:55.960 --> 37:07.120\nhave to do first is, is, is go back over our whole fucking life and, and, and you never\n\n37:07.120 --> 37:08.680\nhave to put it in a journal.\n\n37:08.680 --> 37:11.000\nYou don't have to issue a press release.\n\n37:11.000 --> 37:13.560\nYou don't have to call anybody and say you're sorry.\n\n37:13.560 --> 37:20.040\nYou do just, but you, there will be no, you can, you can welch on this after you agree\n\n37:20.040 --> 37:21.040\nto do it.\n\n37:21.040 --> 37:22.040\nJust open your panel.\n\n37:22.040 --> 37:28.520\nIf you're over 30, go back, go back to like 10 or eight and just kind of just, just, you\n\n37:28.520 --> 37:29.680\ndon't, you don't have to do that.\n\n37:29.680 --> 37:30.680\nYou're not combing a beach.\n\n37:30.680 --> 37:33.680\nYou know that these fucking moments have charged to them.\n\n37:33.680 --> 37:38.320\nYour moments with women, your relationships, the moment of your conquest, the moment of\n\n37:38.320 --> 37:43.200\nyour defeat, the moment of when you realize so and so was a bitch, the moment you realize\n\n37:43.200 --> 37:48.240\nthat you didn't want this, but you prefer that and you're kind of into that.\n\n37:48.240 --> 37:52.000\nAny, any moments that are charged with sexuality, just pop back over to them.\n\n37:52.000 --> 37:54.960\nThey're like marked on your little sci-fi map.\n\n37:54.960 --> 37:59.760\nThey're marked with fucking, they're marked and go back to them and just, and just, and\n\n37:59.760 --> 38:04.760\njust relive them and, and, and, and say, oh, oh man.\n\n38:04.760 --> 38:13.080\nIf I did that right now in front of me, I would say to me, okay, hey, here, listen,\n\n38:13.080 --> 38:14.080\nthat's not fair.\n\n38:14.080 --> 38:15.080\nYeah.\n\n38:15.080 --> 38:16.080\nOr whatever you'd say.\n\n38:16.080 --> 38:18.680\nLike, here's what, here's what your current me shouldn't be saying.\n\n38:18.680 --> 38:19.680\nYou piece of shit.\n\n38:19.680 --> 38:20.880\nYou fucking jerk off.\n\n38:20.880 --> 38:21.880\nYou don't know the rules.\n\n38:21.880 --> 38:22.880\nYou piece of shit.\n\n38:22.880 --> 38:23.880\nFuck you.\n\n38:23.880 --> 38:26.280\nDon't, don't you know fucking chicks like it this way now?\n\n38:26.280 --> 38:27.800\nLike that guy's not a hero.\n\n38:27.800 --> 38:31.600\nLike I'm saying your real self that's like, ooh, fuck, I didn't know.\n\n38:31.600 --> 38:33.000\nI didn't know.\n\n38:33.000 --> 38:34.400\nI was, I didn't know.\n\n38:34.400 --> 38:35.400\nI wouldn't know what I was doing.\n\n38:35.400 --> 38:40.360\nAnd it's embarrassing because you look at it and you go, how could I not know?\n\n38:40.360 --> 38:43.640\nHow could you not know that that was wrong?\n\n38:43.640 --> 38:48.640\nIt's just, you know, it's, it's, it's very similar to what I went through with just\n\n38:48.640 --> 38:51.560\nstop eating meat, you know, the click in your head of, what am I doing?\n\n38:51.560 --> 38:52.560\nYeah.\n\n38:52.560 --> 38:53.560\nEven just, what am I doing?\n\n38:53.560 --> 38:57.360\nLike, not to gain say you, like, like, like, forget about the word wrong, because then\n\n38:57.360 --> 39:00.240\nit like creates this dichotomy of like, there's a perfect way to be.\n\n39:00.240 --> 39:05.120\nI'm saying that that's like, it's like, what, what, with your meat eating, you're not running\n\n39:05.120 --> 39:08.120\naround telling everybody not to eat meat, but it's hard to.\n\n39:08.120 --> 39:09.120\nBut I want to.\n\n39:09.120 --> 39:13.840\nWell, but, but you're lived by example and you express yourself and you go like, I didn't\n\n39:13.840 --> 39:15.240\neat meat today, whatever the fuck.\n\n39:15.240 --> 39:18.440\nYou don't like run around and hit people on the head with a brick.\n\n39:18.440 --> 39:21.520\nI'm just saying that's not my point at all.\n\n39:21.520 --> 39:22.520\nI know, I know.\n\n39:22.520 --> 39:24.680\nYou can be evangelical about you're not eating meat.\n\n39:24.680 --> 39:25.680\nIt's okay.\n\n39:25.680 --> 39:26.680\nIt's okay.\n\n39:26.680 --> 39:27.680\nIt's fine.\n\n39:27.680 --> 39:28.680\nLike.\n\n39:28.680 --> 39:31.960\nAwareness, that's where I'm starting.\n\n39:31.960 --> 39:32.960\nYeah.\n\n39:32.960 --> 39:33.960\nI'm embarrassed.\n\n39:33.960 --> 39:34.960\nI'm 44.\n\n39:34.960 --> 39:42.560\nI spent a really long time thinking about women as being a huge portion of that time has been\n\n39:42.560 --> 39:52.160\nmy feminist phase, which just means that I've recognized that there's a different protocol.\n\n39:52.160 --> 39:57.800\nLike, but the entire time was like, there's a division.\n\n39:57.800 --> 40:00.800\nSometimes it's a, it's a wall over which I'm handing care packages.\n\n40:00.800 --> 40:04.880\nSometimes it's a wall over, you know, back in my twenties, I'm lobbying like M eighties\n\n40:04.880 --> 40:07.880\nover it and dead frogs to get a scream.\n\n40:07.880 --> 40:12.040\nUm, then, then it's like, I'm drilling a hole in it because I'm a hero.\n\n40:12.040 --> 40:13.960\nThis wall should come down.\n\n40:13.960 --> 40:16.800\nI don't like, there's a wall there.\n\n40:16.800 --> 40:20.440\nLike I, I, I, it has been there forever.\n\n40:20.440 --> 40:24.160\nLike, and it, it's like, I'm sorry about that.\n\n40:24.160 --> 40:34.400\nI feel remorse for that and I'm like, I'm trying to like, uh, like, like, notice when\n\n40:34.400 --> 40:41.680\nI like, when I'm saying shit because it's the easy thing to say and when, and when,\n\n40:41.680 --> 40:44.960\nand when, because it's the next thing that you should say and when, and when it's the\n\n40:44.960 --> 40:50.480\nnext thing that you should say in order to keep your job or make yourself more comfortable\n\n40:50.480 --> 40:57.080\nor feel good or all this stuff, like it's, it's, it's, it's, it's time to just sort\n\n40:57.080 --> 41:01.920\nof start thinking ergonomically about that stuff and, and, and you guys that are 25,\n\n41:01.920 --> 41:04.320\nlike, okay, Spencer and Levy are sitting here.\n\n41:04.320 --> 41:12.120\nLet's, let's, let's, let's, okay, okay, 32 is the new 25, uh, the, the, how old are\n\n41:12.120 --> 41:13.120\nyou guys?\n\n41:13.120 --> 41:14.120\nWhat are you?\n\n41:14.120 --> 41:15.120\n28, 28.\n\n41:15.120 --> 41:16.120\nAll right.\n\n41:16.120 --> 41:20.200\nNow, now, now tell us everything, all right.\n\n41:20.200 --> 41:21.720\nIt turns out women are people.\n\n41:21.720 --> 41:22.720\nYeah.\n\n41:22.720 --> 41:23.720\nSee.\n\n41:23.720 --> 41:24.720\nNo, I don't know.\n\n41:24.720 --> 41:26.720\nI'm roadie, smug, millennial.\n\n41:26.720 --> 41:28.720\nThat was a, that was a way you wanted.\n\n41:28.720 --> 41:30.320\nIt was a simple, sucky up kind of.\n\n41:30.320 --> 41:34.920\nI wanted you to talk for 40 minutes or like a, I mean, I guess when I have these conversations\n\n41:34.920 --> 41:40.400\nwith friends, it's always, it always comes back to just socialization and, you know,\n\n41:40.400 --> 41:44.920\nthrough the, through the decades, the American way was like women's stay in the kitchen and\n\n41:44.920 --> 41:45.920\nthey raise the kids.\n\n41:45.920 --> 41:46.920\nThey're pets.\n\n41:46.920 --> 41:49.680\nI mean, essentially, I guess, I mean, that's what it is.\n\n41:49.680 --> 41:50.680\nYeah.\n\n41:50.680 --> 41:51.680\nCompanion.\n\n41:51.680 --> 41:52.680\nPeople.\n\n41:52.680 --> 41:53.680\nYeah.\n\n41:53.680 --> 41:54.680\nAnd then.\n\n41:54.680 --> 41:55.680\nBut that's not how anybody in this room or anybody that we've talked to has ever, say\n\n41:55.680 --> 41:58.280\nit's easy to go like the idea that women should stay in the kitchen.\n\n41:58.280 --> 41:59.280\nNo, no, no, no.\n\n41:59.280 --> 42:00.840\nNo, that's, that's our parents.\n\n42:00.840 --> 42:01.840\nRight.\n\n42:01.840 --> 42:06.560\nBut like, let's take my like conservative grandmother, for instance, like, she's cool\n\n42:06.560 --> 42:16.880\nwith like everyone getting work and whatever, but what's her name, Judy, Judy, Judy, Judy\n\n42:16.880 --> 42:20.360\nLevy, no, Levy, LeBetsky, LeBetsky.\n\n42:20.360 --> 42:21.360\nI'm not calling her out.\n\n42:21.360 --> 42:24.840\nI mean, she's just, she grew up in a, Oh, sorry, you probably didn't want to mention\n\n42:24.840 --> 42:25.840\nher name.\n\n42:25.840 --> 42:26.840\nRight.\n\n42:26.840 --> 42:31.640\nAnd she grew up in a time where like, you know, there was a certain expectation and,\n\n42:31.640 --> 42:36.680\nyou know, like, I think my grandfather said this weekend, like women went to college just\n\n42:36.680 --> 42:38.080\nto get married.\n\n42:38.080 --> 42:39.360\nAnd she was like, that's not true.\n\n42:39.360 --> 42:41.080\nI got a really great education.\n\n42:41.080 --> 42:49.040\nIt just so happens that was a place that most women met men and got married and then ultimately\n\n42:49.040 --> 42:50.720\ndidn't pursue work.\n\n42:50.720 --> 42:55.640\nBut just the idea that like my grandfather in his head is like, yeah, well, women just,\n\n42:55.640 --> 42:57.640\nthat's the only reason they were going to college.\n\n42:57.640 --> 42:58.640\nI don't know.\n\n42:58.640 --> 43:03.160\nIt's just, I feel like those conversations, I like those are then, then we're in this\n\n43:03.160 --> 43:06.960\nditch of like unsolvability and all this stuff.\n\n43:06.960 --> 43:10.400\nNo, I think what you're saying, I mean, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not pooping on what you're\n\n43:10.400 --> 43:11.400\nexpressing.\n\n43:11.400 --> 43:14.600\nI'm like, I'm yes, and again, going again, yeah, this is the thing that like distracts\n\n43:14.600 --> 43:21.520\nus is the, is the conversations about how society works like in a nuts and bolts way.\n\n43:21.520 --> 43:28.240\nLike how far are you into a conversation about being conscious of other people before it\n\n43:28.240 --> 43:31.840\nimmediately gets like, it's like two, two sentences before you're talking about who\n\n43:31.840 --> 43:37.160\nopens the car door and who pays for the, for dinner and minimum wage and, and all the stuff\n\n43:37.160 --> 43:41.440\nwhich actually like ties everything in a giant knot and you can't move forward.\n\n43:41.440 --> 43:44.360\nBut it's, it's all about progress.\n\n43:44.360 --> 43:49.480\nAnd I think that this particular type of conversation changes, it changes that conversation.\n\n43:49.480 --> 43:56.200\nAnd, and like, you know, this is such a trying time that I think that it's hurting certain\n\n43:56.200 --> 43:57.200\nareas.\n\n43:57.200 --> 44:02.520\nAnd I think that, you know, hopefully this, we move forward and it's, and, and things\n\n44:02.520 --> 44:03.520\nstart to get better.\n\n44:03.520 --> 44:07.200\nLike uncomfortable people avoid it and they go, I don't want to hear it.\n\n44:07.200 --> 44:08.200\nIt's fine.\n\n44:08.200 --> 44:09.200\nThe way it is.\n\n44:09.200 --> 44:10.200\nIt's because nobody wants to be wrong.\n\n44:10.200 --> 44:11.200\nYeah.\n\n44:11.200 --> 44:12.200\nI'm wrong about everything.\n\n44:12.200 --> 44:13.200\nI'm wrong about everything.\n\n44:13.200 --> 44:14.200\nI've been wrong about everything my whole life.\n\n44:14.200 --> 44:15.200\nOh God.\n\n44:15.200 --> 44:16.200\nOh God, you're wrong.\n\n44:16.200 --> 44:17.200\nDid you hear, did you hear what he said?\n\n44:17.200 --> 44:18.200\nHe said he was wrong.\n\n44:18.200 --> 44:19.200\nYou're wrong.\n\n44:19.200 --> 44:20.200\nYou're wrong.\n\n44:20.200 --> 44:21.200\nYou got this wrong.\n\n44:21.200 --> 44:22.200\nYou use the wrong word.\n\n44:22.200 --> 44:23.200\nYou use the wrong thing.\n\n44:23.200 --> 44:24.200\nAnd like that's the other thing that we're like sick of hearing about how we forgot the\n\n44:24.200 --> 44:25.200\nrust belt.\n\n44:25.200 --> 44:27.400\nAnd that's like, now we have a Nazi in the White House because apparently some fucking redneck\n\n44:27.400 --> 44:29.960\nsomewhere got tired of being ignored.\n\n44:29.960 --> 44:30.960\nEverything we do is wrong.\n\n44:30.960 --> 44:34.240\nWe're wrong if we're being right too much, we're wrong.\n\n44:34.240 --> 44:40.160\nBut like, we're all, yeah, I just like fucking like, I'm 44 and I'm like, I'm wrong about\n\n44:40.160 --> 44:41.160\neverything.\n\n44:41.160 --> 44:42.160\nI'm always wrong.\n\n44:42.160 --> 44:45.880\nAnd it's like, like, isn't that a good, like if you woke up and said, like, I'm wrong.\n\n44:45.880 --> 44:47.240\nI'm going to be wrong today.\n\n44:47.240 --> 44:49.080\nI'm still, I was wrong yesterday.\n\n44:49.080 --> 44:51.160\nI'm going to be wrong more today.\n\n44:51.160 --> 45:00.240\nAnd like, like, and I, why is it that when a woman comes into my wrongness and says,\n\n45:00.240 --> 45:05.120\nlike, maybe this, and that's like, I have an increased tendency to go like, well, I don't\n\n45:05.120 --> 45:07.240\nknow about that, but I'm just saying I'm wrong.\n\n45:07.240 --> 45:14.160\nLike I have fucking issues and I have like, like shit that I need to like, like grease\n\n45:14.160 --> 45:16.120\nand loosen and pull apart.\n\n45:16.120 --> 45:18.240\nDo you want to ask a woman?\n\n45:18.240 --> 45:19.240\nAsk a woman.\n\n45:19.240 --> 45:20.240\nI don't want to ask a woman anything.\n\n45:20.240 --> 45:24.600\nNo, I think that there's like, you know, the hippie counterculture introduced this concept\n\n45:24.600 --> 45:29.520\nwhere like, no one that anyone says is true and anyone that anyone tells you is the establishment\n\n45:29.520 --> 45:32.840\ntrying to force a new hegemony on you.\n\n45:32.840 --> 45:38.240\nAnd that opened the door for basically saying that anything that science, anything that anyone\n\n45:38.240 --> 45:43.480\nhas told you as fact is biased and is trying to sell you something, which kind of open\n\n45:43.480 --> 45:49.720\nup the door for what we understand to be hippie stuff, you know, yoga, meditation, crystals,\n\n45:49.720 --> 45:55.120\nsex cults, like all this stuff kind of grew out of alternative, non scientific ways of\n\n45:55.120 --> 46:00.280\ntrying to understand the world, and it kind of gained steam and power and became this\n\n46:00.280 --> 46:06.080\ncountercultural thing and that grew into like, there's bodies of facts to support any position\n\n46:06.080 --> 46:11.480\nand there's a book on this and a book on ghosts and then it kind of gives the idea that completely\n\n46:11.480 --> 46:16.600\nnon scientific kind of non intellectual things can have the auspices of intellectuality and\n\n46:16.600 --> 46:20.600\nkind of the responsible credibility of something that's real.\n\n46:20.600 --> 46:25.360\nAnd that kind of created a world where people can feel comfortable just being right all\n\n46:25.360 --> 46:29.600\nthe time and creating new systems that create ways for that they're right.\n\n46:29.600 --> 46:33.480\nAnd so everyone's kind of ensconced themselves in these silos of thinking that have kind\n\n46:33.480 --> 46:37.520\nof just existed concurrently and not ever butted into each other.\n\n46:37.520 --> 46:41.960\nAnd that the feel, well, because the feeling of being wrong means that you can't charge\n\n46:41.960 --> 46:44.960\nfor charge anyone money to be wrong, right?\n\n46:44.960 --> 46:47.480\nYou can charge somebody money to be right.\n\n46:47.480 --> 46:49.680\nAnd I think it's American to you.\n\n46:49.680 --> 46:53.440\nYou go like it's like there's no reward for saying, I don't know.\n\n46:53.440 --> 46:54.440\nI don't know.\n\n46:54.440 --> 46:57.160\nI think I got that wrong.\n\n46:57.160 --> 46:58.160\nI don't know.\n\n46:58.160 --> 46:59.160\nYeah.\n\n46:59.160 --> 47:01.640\nI think in like the Middle East, people will get a lot more mad and get into arguments\n\n47:01.640 --> 47:04.640\nand in other countries, people will be more comfortable with stuff like that.\n\n47:04.640 --> 47:09.480\nBut I think specifically in America, we have this discomfort with with really budding up\n\n47:09.480 --> 47:13.840\nagainst people and having these outward political debates, I mean, until very recently because\n\n47:13.840 --> 47:14.840\nit's kind of exploded.\n\n47:14.840 --> 47:15.840\nYeah.\n\n47:15.840 --> 47:23.160\nAnd that's what feels like it's like there's always like, yeah, man, like it's my nightmare\n\n47:23.160 --> 47:26.680\nto be stupid and to be wrong and to be talking out of my ass and all this stuff.\n\n47:26.680 --> 47:29.680\nLike I want to go back and I want to start this podcast over again.\n\n47:29.680 --> 47:31.920\nI was a fucking babbling idiot.\n\n47:31.920 --> 47:34.840\nYou don't want to have listened to it.\n\n47:34.840 --> 47:41.720\nI'll try better next week, but like if I'm already wrong, I'm wrong.\n\n47:41.720 --> 47:42.920\nSo then what do you do?\n\n47:42.920 --> 47:46.840\nLike you like, so my therapist is saying like, it's time.\n\n47:46.840 --> 47:49.280\nDid I explain this?\n\n47:49.280 --> 47:53.840\nI'm not making any sense like where it's like, here's how I perceive the world working when\n\n47:53.840 --> 47:57.280\na human being like walks around and okay, so I'm going to walk.\n\n47:57.280 --> 47:59.200\nI'm going to see a, all right.\n\n47:59.200 --> 48:00.680\nSo say something to me.\n\n48:00.680 --> 48:01.680\nHi there, sir.\n\n48:01.680 --> 48:02.680\nHow are you doing?\n\n48:02.680 --> 48:03.680\nOkay.\n\n48:03.680 --> 48:04.680\nSo I just heard the words.\n\n48:04.680 --> 48:05.680\nHi there, sir.\n\n48:05.680 --> 48:06.680\nHow are you doing?\n\n48:06.680 --> 48:07.680\nThere's a guy in the sidewalk.\n\n48:07.680 --> 48:14.560\nThat those facts went into my head and now I envision them as going down a pipe through\n\n48:14.560 --> 48:20.680\nmy face, down my neck, and then at my chest level, above my solar plexus, but right at\n\n48:20.680 --> 48:28.000\nthe top, right between my neck and like right between my nipples, there's a box.\n\n48:28.000 --> 48:33.320\nIt's a square box that all the information from my ears and eyes goes into.\n\n48:33.320 --> 48:36.440\nThis is the first stop that it goes into.\n\n48:36.440 --> 48:45.680\nAnd it's like, it's, I don't, I'm scared to call it society or, it's just like, it's\n\n48:45.680 --> 48:46.680\nFreudian terms.\n\n48:46.680 --> 48:53.760\nI think maybe it's experience, the supernatural, let's just call it nurture versus nature,\n\n48:53.760 --> 48:57.400\nbut that's distracting too, but it's like.\n\n48:57.400 --> 48:58.400\nIt's a construct.\n\n48:58.400 --> 49:02.640\nYeah, it's norms, norms, socialization.\n\n49:02.640 --> 49:09.040\nIt's stored processing, a programming that you have assembled because there probably\n\n49:09.040 --> 49:13.440\nis on some psychological level, the equivalent of a metabolism and it probably saves time\n\n49:13.440 --> 49:17.480\nto not have to think about a bunch of shit implicit bias to not have to learn to tie\n\n49:17.480 --> 49:25.080\nyour shoes every morning to not have to wonder what a wood is and realize that it used to\n\n49:25.080 --> 49:28.120\nbe trees, but so you can continue making your deck.\n\n49:28.120 --> 49:29.120\nYou have to go.\n\n49:29.120 --> 49:30.120\nI guess I'm making it now.\n\n49:30.120 --> 49:35.840\nThat sounds like amnesia, but anyways, it's the shit that you've, you've, you've accepted\n\n49:35.840 --> 49:36.840\nas fact.\n\n49:36.840 --> 49:37.840\nRight.\n\n49:37.840 --> 49:43.960\nUm, and like, we are so advanced now that that information, if you're living in a city\n\n49:43.960 --> 49:50.360\nand someone comes up to you and says what Rob just said, hello, uh, it goes into a box\n\n49:50.360 --> 49:56.000\nand like, of course there's a hello back, like that's like the first thing in there.\n\n49:56.000 --> 50:00.560\nThere's, there's a million things based on whatever you're perceiving.\n\n50:00.560 --> 50:07.320\nMost importantly, it never, I feel like I have arranged in my body, that box is above\n\n50:07.320 --> 50:14.200\nanother optional box, which has to do with me, like learning shit, where I am like vulnerable,\n\n50:14.200 --> 50:21.000\nwhere I am wondering what's going on the baby, the guy that's like, well, I don't know.\n\n50:21.000 --> 50:22.880\nSo let's find out what the fuck is that?\n\n50:22.880 --> 50:23.880\nWhat's going on?\n\n50:23.880 --> 50:34.560\nAnd we have like, I, I, I am using my I statements, uh, like I have such a hard time getting to\n\n50:34.560 --> 50:35.560\nthat person.\n\n50:35.560 --> 50:42.760\nLike, like the shoebox of, of fucking options up here is so like, there's getting to the\n\n50:42.760 --> 50:45.000\nperson that said, Hey, how are you doing today?\n\n50:45.000 --> 50:51.760\nIt could be a headline, it could be a headline about a 78 people getting shot in a mass shooting.\n\n50:51.760 --> 50:56.720\nIt could be a, um, my friend saying, um, I've just turned vegan and I don't want to eat\n\n50:56.720 --> 50:57.720\nmeat anymore.\n\n50:57.720 --> 50:59.120\nYeah, it's, it's cruel.\n\n50:59.120 --> 51:00.920\nIt could be someone saying, I'm Muslim.\n\n51:00.920 --> 51:05.440\nIt could be someone saying, uh, your friend Glenn just sexually harassed me at the carnival\n\n51:05.440 --> 51:08.280\nlast night and you're still friends with him and it hurts my feelings.\n\n51:08.280 --> 51:10.880\nIt could be, um, did you watch big bang theory?\n\n51:10.880 --> 51:14.800\nIt could be, um, uh, here's how you install a backsplash for your sink.\n\n51:14.800 --> 51:19.360\nAny information that comes into you, like everything, all of your experience, I'm just\n\n51:19.360 --> 51:25.720\nsaying, I, I, I like, I think there are two boxes.\n\n51:25.720 --> 51:27.600\nI think I'm an unconscious person.\n\n51:27.600 --> 51:32.320\nWell, I think that that second box is like, maybe like core values and beliefs and stuff\n\n51:32.320 --> 51:38.080\nthat kind of form, I don't know, like our religiosity, our, uh, you know, uh, attitudes\n\n51:38.080 --> 51:42.360\ntowards authority and like that really forms our core identity, but that is definitely\n\n51:42.360 --> 51:45.800\npart of knowing traffic laws and piracy laws and stuff.\n\n51:45.800 --> 51:50.400\nAnd it's like, it is, that stuff is important, but that stuff isn't who we truly are.\n\n51:50.400 --> 51:55.520\nSo like, I definitely think there are these two, two kinds of things that we, and one\n\n51:55.520 --> 51:57.200\nof them is mostly unconscious.\n\n51:57.200 --> 52:01.640\nI think we had that one neuro Scientologist lady on and she was talking about implicit\n\n52:01.640 --> 52:06.880\nbias, but I think that that like bias comes a lot from these, these core values that just\n\n52:06.880 --> 52:12.360\nform our base identity and our kind of like world or like, like perspective, just when\n\n52:12.360 --> 52:15.120\nwe are growing up, you know, our privilege and stuff.\n\n52:15.120 --> 52:19.760\nLike that's all just formed from these core truths that we understand that come from privilege\n\n52:19.760 --> 52:23.320\nbecause the core truths of like a white male are going to be way different than the core\n\n52:23.320 --> 52:27.640\ntruths from like a black, you know, girl growing up in a, in a neighborhood with, you\n\n52:27.640 --> 52:29.800\nknow, police presence all the time.\n\n52:29.800 --> 52:33.400\nSo it just kind of, it kind of, but there, you can change them.\n\n52:33.400 --> 52:38.000\nI think it's just a lot harder because they are these core values that we recognize are\n\n52:38.000 --> 52:40.000\nimportant to our sense of identity.\n\n52:40.000 --> 52:44.240\nAnd I think we're in a world that like figuring out our identity and what side we're on and\n\n52:44.240 --> 52:49.080\nwhether we're cool with that or whatever is becoming something that maybe media or culture\n\n52:49.080 --> 52:54.080\nis kind of hyper, uh, hyper rising, like kind of whipping into a froth weaponizing probably\n\n52:54.080 --> 52:58.800\nfor marketing purposes, but it's like becoming more of a thing where you have to pick a site.\n\n52:58.800 --> 53:02.560\nWhereas I don't think you, you used to, you used to be able to like, Oh, well, how about\n\n53:02.560 --> 53:03.560\nthat?\n\n53:03.560 --> 53:04.560\nDid you hear about that?\n\n53:04.560 --> 53:05.560\nWow.\n\n53:05.560 --> 53:07.200\nYou know, and now it's like, I'm okay with that.\n\n53:07.200 --> 53:09.040\nI'm not going to be okay with that.\n\n53:09.040 --> 53:10.480\nShould I be okay with that?\n\n53:10.480 --> 53:14.040\nI think I'm okay with that unless someone has any reason why I shouldn't be.\n\n53:14.040 --> 53:15.040\nAnd I don't know.\n\n53:15.040 --> 53:17.920\nI think it just is like, we're more primed to either accept or reject things.\n\n53:17.920 --> 53:20.760\nI think, I think, but the thing, the thing that I think is real interesting about this\n\n53:20.760 --> 53:26.240\nconversation is like traditionally, uh, you know, the older you get, the more you get\n\n53:26.240 --> 53:32.440\nset in your ways and you know, there's a hundred standup references to like the, the\n\n53:32.440 --> 53:38.440\nfour words that you get from your, your uncle or, or, or your, your parents saying all this\n\n53:38.440 --> 53:40.520\nracist stuff or what a class of stuff.\n\n53:40.520 --> 53:44.320\nLike it's just because that's how they were raised and they're not learning, but what\n\n53:44.320 --> 53:48.360\nyou're going through Dan and what, what I'm going through and what it seems like the world\n\n53:48.360 --> 53:53.080\nour generation is going through is we're kind of looking to back and going, we were wrong\n\n53:53.080 --> 53:54.080\nback.\n\n53:54.080 --> 53:57.080\nI know you don't want to say wrong with the C on the way I can explain it, but I was like,\n\n53:57.080 --> 54:02.160\nI look back and I go, yeah, there was a time where I was like, no, women are the enemy\n\n54:02.160 --> 54:03.920\nand they deserve it.\n\n54:03.920 --> 54:10.280\nAnd I'm going to be on the guy side because women judge me and say yes or no to me and\n\n54:10.280 --> 54:12.800\nanybody in a position of power is got to be evil.\n\n54:12.800 --> 54:20.080\nSo they deserve whatever and I've thought that way most of my life because I'm the,\n\n54:20.080 --> 54:21.080\nI'm the underdog.\n\n54:21.080 --> 54:24.200\nI don't deserve this and why can't it be easier for me?\n\n54:24.200 --> 54:27.080\nAnd that's my fault and it's shitty.\n\n54:27.080 --> 54:30.880\nAnd I, and I, yeah, because how many ways did you fucking bother to second guess the\n\n54:30.880 --> 54:31.880\nsystem?\n\n54:31.880 --> 54:32.880\nYeah.\n\n54:32.880 --> 54:35.880\nYou know, when they told you not to cut school, when they told you not to be as into Jackie\n\n54:35.880 --> 54:40.240\nChan bootleg videos, when they told you Dungeons and Dragons wasn't cool, when they,\n\n54:40.240 --> 54:41.680\nyou know, it's like, we're so fucking late.\n\n54:41.680 --> 54:45.800\nIt's like you pick and choose which, which area of being a hero, which feels right.\n\n54:45.800 --> 54:49.400\nAnd sometimes when it feels right, it's just avoiding the truth.\n\n54:49.400 --> 54:53.320\nBut the other side of that is like, as soon as I start saying that, I know cause it's\n\n54:53.320 --> 54:56.040\nlike, then you start going, what, wait, what are you saying?\n\n54:56.040 --> 54:58.840\nLike who do you don't owe anybody anything?\n\n54:58.840 --> 55:00.840\nYou don't, you don't, no one's going to take your pants.\n\n55:00.840 --> 55:02.640\nYou know, they're not going to lose any trail mix.\n\n55:02.640 --> 55:05.360\nThere's not going to be any less teeth under your pillow tomorrow.\n\n55:05.360 --> 55:09.080\nI, that's where I, that's how we're used to processing things.\n\n55:09.080 --> 55:11.680\nLike someone's coming for my fucking shit.\n\n55:11.680 --> 55:17.840\nSo if you, if you let that guy spit on you at recess tomorrow, um, you know, he, and\n\n55:17.840 --> 55:22.360\nyou don't do something about it, like he's going to spit on you twice as much as he spits\n\n55:22.360 --> 55:26.720\non, uh, Toby Richards, because Toby Richards, you know what he did, he fucking kicked him\n\n55:26.720 --> 55:27.720\nin the nuts.\n\n55:27.720 --> 55:29.200\nHe still got his ass kicked, but he didn't get spit on it anymore.\n\n55:29.200 --> 55:34.200\nAnd like logic, logic, logic, logic, logic, slippery slope, hierarchy, logic, logic, logic.\n\n55:34.200 --> 55:37.000\nUh, Dan, when did your podcast stop being funny?\n\n55:37.000 --> 55:42.800\nWhen your mama fucking slurped on my giant knob, uh, I, I, I already warned you about\n\n55:42.800 --> 55:43.800\nthis.\n\n55:43.800 --> 55:44.800\nOkay.\n\n55:44.800 --> 55:45.800\nI just want to address that one more time.\n\n55:45.800 --> 55:46.800\nVoice in my head.\n\n55:46.800 --> 55:47.800\nI'm just saying, I understand.\n\n55:47.800 --> 55:52.680\nI, I, I spent the weekend inadvertently going through YouTube clips of like when my podcast\n\n55:52.680 --> 55:53.680\nis really funny.\n\n55:53.680 --> 55:55.520\nA lot of times Rob's on when that's happening.\n\n55:55.520 --> 55:56.520\nThat's true.\n\n55:56.520 --> 55:58.360\nUm, so I thought I'd invite him back tonight.\n\n55:58.360 --> 56:02.840\nBoy, I'm really, really doing that.\n\n56:02.840 --> 56:09.760\nI don't, I don't, I don't, all I can tell you is like, like, like, I'll be, the funny,\n\n56:09.760 --> 56:10.760\nthe funny is happening.\n\n56:10.760 --> 56:15.200\nIt doesn't have to be funny when I'm, when I'm not losing my mind and we're not losing\n\n56:15.200 --> 56:18.320\nour mind when, when there's not shit going on, it's just like, you know, we just mark\n\n56:18.320 --> 56:19.320\nthese occasions.\n\n56:19.320 --> 56:20.320\nYou, you click on this one.\n\n56:20.320 --> 56:25.920\nYou go, oh, that must have been when, uh, the Ros, Ros McGowan was doing that thing\n\n56:25.920 --> 56:26.920\non the, on the Twitter.\n\n56:26.920 --> 56:31.760\nUm, but anyways, I do remember when those aliens were found at Ros McGowan.\n\n56:31.760 --> 56:38.760\nI want to, I want, I can't, I want to say one thing about, about, about Rose, aka Joan\n\n56:38.760 --> 56:45.680\nof Arc right now, because there's this awesome thing happening, which, uh, like Twitter was\n\n56:45.680 --> 56:51.800\nused to get a, a president elected in a way that really bummed us out because leading\n\n56:51.800 --> 56:56.160\nup to that, the accepted thing was that Twitter couldn't accomplish anything real.\n\n56:56.160 --> 56:57.160\nThat was worth any change.\n\n56:57.160 --> 57:03.280\nAnd for it to get like hacked, whether you use that term like literally or not, but like\n\n57:03.280 --> 57:09.160\nfor it to be, I, it's unfairly or not for it to be used as a real world tool to just\n\n57:09.160 --> 57:15.680\naffect real change for the bad guys was like really demoralizing, especially for people\n\n57:15.680 --> 57:18.560\nlike me who grew up on the internet.\n\n57:18.560 --> 57:24.720\nWe thought we created as a place to hide from really awful people, asterisk per our other\n\n57:24.720 --> 57:27.760\nconversation, we're finding out that that entire time we were also awful people because\n\n57:27.760 --> 57:30.960\nwe fantasized about being Han Solo who was a piece of shit to live in.\n\n57:30.960 --> 57:31.960\nAll right.\n\n57:31.960 --> 57:38.600\nBut the, but then this is why even though it's like a kind of like nice book end to\n\n57:38.600 --> 57:43.200\nthis thing, because now we're, this is the, this is the second time since the election\n\n57:43.200 --> 57:50.040\nof that parasite that what's happening on Twitter, as soon as I mentioned it to my therapist,\n\n57:50.040 --> 57:53.480\nshe knows what I'm talking about and shit's happening.\n\n57:53.480 --> 57:58.320\nThere's a court of public opinion that got leveraged on Twitter that was used to create\n\n57:58.320 --> 58:04.200\nreal world results that like heads rolled down the physical street with the potatoes.\n\n58:04.200 --> 58:09.720\nIt wasn't like cancel Colbert, nothing happens because first of all, what are you doing second\n\n58:09.720 --> 58:11.680\nof all, blah, blah, blah.\n\n58:11.680 --> 58:17.440\nThe world just continuing to like circulate while Twitter acts like there's something\n\n58:17.440 --> 58:19.080\nthat can be done.\n\n58:19.080 --> 58:25.200\nIt was like, this feels like exhilarating, but the funny thing about it is that it feels\n\n58:25.200 --> 58:29.200\nexhilarating in a way that feels like the fire is outside my front porch.\n\n58:29.200 --> 58:33.000\nDid, did, did she get, was there a Twitter account?\n\n58:33.000 --> 58:35.720\nLike, is it like she got suspended because she, but is it back?\n\n58:35.720 --> 58:38.000\nI mean, I, I assume, I assume it's back.\n\n58:38.000 --> 58:39.000\nYeah.\n\n58:39.000 --> 58:40.000\nYeah.\n\n58:40.000 --> 58:41.000\nI haven't read it.\n\n58:41.000 --> 58:42.000\nI haven't read it.\n\n58:42.000 --> 58:44.160\nThe last thing I heard while this is actually why I wanted to bring it up.\n\n58:44.160 --> 58:47.680\nIt's an anecdotal thing that made me want to just say one thing as long as I'm not being\n\n58:47.680 --> 58:53.080\nfunny, like to the extreme, like there was a recent thing that just happened that I was\n\n58:53.080 --> 58:57.440\nhearing about like the, while getting ready to take my girlfriend's day at the dinner,\n\n58:57.440 --> 59:05.520\nwhich was like, uh, um, she said something that it crossed a racial line and she was\n\n59:05.520 --> 59:08.360\ntrying to reach for an allegory to help whatever.\n\n59:08.360 --> 59:14.800\nAnd then there was flash, blowback flashback, the whiteback, black, black, like black flashback\n\n59:14.800 --> 59:20.040\nof the, of the clack, like, like, like it exploded and it got all fucked up.\n\n59:20.040 --> 59:24.720\nAnd I, and I, like halfway through hearing about it, I just wanted to like, like, I was\n\n59:24.720 --> 59:29.320\nlike, are we, are we like, isn't this what we've been doing for like 15 years?\n\n59:29.320 --> 59:33.080\nLike, like we keep on like, like a cool shit starts happening.\n\n59:33.080 --> 59:38.360\nAnd then like the bad guys don't, they don't have this, they don't have this obstacle in\n\n59:38.360 --> 59:45.240\ntheir path where everything, like, like, where, like we, we hold, we hold our, our, our people\n\n59:45.240 --> 59:50.040\nwho are, who are helping us, like, and making us have conversations, like we hold them to\n\n59:50.040 --> 59:57.000\nthe, to the standard of, as if they're supposed to like, be some kind of like historical figure\n\n59:57.000 --> 01:00:02.480\nthat gets everything right or, and then to the extent that any, our standard for ignoring\n\n01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:09.240\nleaders has become, oh, did we then find out they're not perfect?\n\n01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:15.160\nMeanwhile, the bad guys, they, they're just beating us because they don't have that standard.\n\n01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:16.160\nThey don't care.\n\n01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:20.880\nYou can be a Republican that does not believe at all in Mexicans being rapists and just wants\n\n01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:25.480\nto gain financially and you can, you can belong to a party where you go like, yeah, but I\n\n01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:28.640\ndon't, I don't, I don't care that he said that.\n\n01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:29.640\nWho gives a shit?\n\n01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:34.280\nI want my money and I'm going to get my money by pretending I don't give a shit what he\n\n01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:35.280\nsays.\n\n01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:41.360\nAnd the good guys are like, fuckin' A, yes, down with the patriarchy, like, let's do this\n\n01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:47.160\none thing and then, and then we, we have that hero worship thing.\n\n01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:53.880\nIt's like, can't you just, can't you, can't you give a woman that stands up for a second\n\n01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:54.880\nof fuckin' break?\n\n01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:56.280\nI, I, like, like, they're not-\n\n01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:58.080\nIt happens so quickly, too.\n\n01:00:58.080 --> 01:00:59.240\nIt's always, it's gonna happen.\n\n01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:00.800\nIt's always gonna happen quickly.\n\n01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:05.440\nIt's like, like, there's always gonna be Tinder and fuckin' like, not the app, the actual\n\n01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:07.120\nthing that we use to start fires.\n\n01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:11.320\nThere's always gonna be a, there's always gonna be, it's, she wasn't running for senator.\n\n01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:16.440\nLike, like, like, Emily Gordon, like, retweeted a link to a thing and I don't know who wrote\n\n01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:17.440\nit.\n\n01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:23.720\nI only, like, I, like, it was years ago and the, the article's headline was, admit it,\n\n01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:28.120\nyour fave is problematic, which, and I was like, what is that, gibberish?\n\n01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:35.240\nI read the articles, like, saying, if you keep holding your, the people you admire to,\n\n01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:44.960\nto, to, to a standard of political, minute to minute, like, perfection, like, then you're,\n\n01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:45.960\nyou're fucking them.\n\n01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:50.640\nI mean, it's, it's, the, the FBI monitored Martin Luther King to make sure, this is like,\n\n01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:55.520\nthey were like, oh man, the minute that guy gets a blow job, then, like, then we don't\n\n01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:57.280\nhave to care about black people anymore.\n\n01:01:57.280 --> 01:01:58.280\nIs that fair?\n\n01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:03.640\nThat's what we're doing to each other now, when we, when we, when we, we just, we just\n\n01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:09.760\nhave to like, can we loosen the fucking, why am I, why am I calling to action?\n\n01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:11.680\nThere's nothing that a biomass can do.\n\n01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:15.080\nThat's just a sad, side effect of oppression, too.\n\n01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:19.760\nIt's like, that's what the system does, is it pits the, the, the small dogs against each\n\n01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:23.000\nother and, and tells them that, that's what they should be doing.\n\n01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:27.800\nOtherwise, they don't have the moral authority to overthrow real oppressors, killing people\n\n01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:29.440\nand robbing families, you know?\n\n01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:31.720\nI mean, I'm not saying that you're wrong to bring it up.\n\n01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:34.960\nIt's just like, that is a, that's a part of the system and it's fucked.\n\n01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:37.320\nBut like, but there's a double standard here, too, right?\n\n01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:42.360\nIf you, if you were to draw a gender line, only because one gender has privilege, I love\n\n01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:43.360\nit.\n\n01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:50.080\nI sound like a college student that in 1992, that, that, that, that, um, women, uh, uniting\n\n01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:55.840\nwithout doing it in a cigar smoke filled room, um, because why would it happen there?\n\n01:02:55.840 --> 01:02:57.160\nHow would it happen there?\n\n01:02:57.160 --> 01:03:00.800\nUh, if you're in a handmade's tale, where are you going to meet, except the produce\n\n01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:01.800\naisle?\n\n01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:09.120\nYou ain't got no fucking freemason lodge that the what, what, what, uh, uh, unprivileged\n\n01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:15.640\nmovements have the total disadvantage of being open source, right?\n\n01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:21.400\nAnd trolls and hecklers and people that just like peer in, if it's a, if it's a movement\n\n01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:25.960\nworth its salt, if it's good, honest people that are like, well, we don't have anything\n\n01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:26.960\nto hide.\n\n01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:30.880\nSo we're not going to meet in a fucking catacomb and plot the destruction of something that\n\n01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:32.240\nshould get me in the electric chair.\n\n01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:36.520\nI'm like, this is a movement that's going to catch fire among the people.\n\n01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:39.920\nAnd it's like, but we live in this flame retardant universe.\n\n01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:40.920\nIt's so unfair.\n\n01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:44.600\nYou go like, Oh, women are, Oh, look, the women are saying they're hashtagging this\n\n01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:45.600\nor that.\n\n01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:49.840\nAnd then it's like, Oh, well, that, that should put a pretty high premium on dividing them\n\n01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:51.160\namongst each other.\n\n01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:53.200\nAnd, uh, and that'll go to shit pretty quick.\n\n01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:54.200\nAnd then we can start laughing.\n\n01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:57.360\nI got like, geez, I wonder how come you guys don't have rights?\n\n01:03:57.360 --> 01:03:58.360\nYeah, sure.\n\n01:03:58.360 --> 01:03:59.920\nCan't get along with each other.\n\n01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:03.000\nMeanwhile, I'm not off to my men's meeting.\n\n01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:06.560\nLike I don't like men and I can say that nothing will happen to me.\n\n01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:08.880\nMen, men are dumb.\n\n01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:09.880\nUh-oh.\n\n01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:12.880\nHey, you know what?\n\n01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:17.000\nI don't like that kind of man that's like, when he's that, that, that's like all about\n\n01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:18.840\nselling himself sexually.\n\n01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:21.960\nI think, I think, I think that person should be ashamed of himself.\n\n01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:24.360\nLike I'm not going to suffer any fucking blowback for that.\n\n01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:31.280\nThere's no among in some men's like, and it's because like, we don't care.\n\n01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:32.840\nThat's also not fair.\n\n01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:40.400\nSo when, if, if, if someone awesome, like Rose McGowan, like he's, he's like, I don't\n\n01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:47.480\nknow how to say the word baggle, like, what are you fucking McGowan Rose McGowan,\n\n01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:48.480\nGowan.\n\n01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:54.840\nUh, if she's going, if the thing that's like catching fire is that she's fucking taken\n\n01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:59.520\nno guff, you know, like, yeah, like, like, like, you see all the, the, our old timers\n\n01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:03.600\nlike are piping up and they're going like, uh, it's, it's funny because they think you\n\n01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:06.960\ngo like, oh, I'm 20 years out from being that tone deaf.\n\n01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:11.240\nThere you go, all of a stone here.\n\n01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:16.600\nUm, now listen, ladies, if something should offend your sensibility, it's simply give\n\n01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:17.600\nit time.\n\n01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:19.600\nThere's a due process for this.\n\n01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:26.000\nWoody Allen shows to, to chime in, he goes, uh, this is, this is probably the best time\n\n01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.600\npeople want to hear what I think it would be.\n\n01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:29.600\nIt would be a shame.\n\n01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:30.600\nYes.\n\n01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:37.200\nLike, you would think he would know the room better than anybody, but he like, what if\n\n01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:41.800\nsomebody like said, Hey, uh, Mr. Allen, uh, it looks like you're enjoying your coffee.\n\n01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:44.120\nWhat do you think about all this crazy stuff?\n\n01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:45.120\nNo comment.\n\n01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:46.120\nLeave me alone.\n\n01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:48.800\nI'm old and it's, it's done.\n\n01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:49.800\nThat's the other thing.\n\n01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:54.920\nThat's the difference with the Woody Allen thing is I feel like I, that's, that is totally\n\n01:05:54.920 --> 01:06:01.040\npossible that somebody literally like, like just said that much and that he and that like\n\n01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:06.440\nhis quote, the one that I heard, which was like, I hope it doesn't turn into a witch hunt.\n\n01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:11.920\nIf you plaster it on the, on Times Square and a scroll and it feels like he issued a\n\n01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:16.440\npress release, like there's like an Allen Greenspan hoping we don't over invest.\n\n01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:22.800\nUm, it's like, like, like, or is it, it could also be him getting into a cab and going,\n\n01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:27.400\nI don't want to, I, I, I, I hope it doesn't, that could be an almost honest thing for him\n\n01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:28.400\nto say.\n\n01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:32.200\nWell, the last thing I need is for that to get, you know, become a trend again.\n\n01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:33.200\nOh boy.\n\n01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:38.280\nHey, I don't, it, this is the things you don't, you don't know the context.\n\n01:06:38.280 --> 01:06:41.960\nAll I know is that he, it didn't sound like something he was saying on the way to the\n\n01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:42.960\ncar.\n\n01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:48.120\nLike I don't want, it didn't, it didn't sound like I don't really want to talk about this.\n\n01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:55.640\nI know you want to comment from me, uh, you know, uh, I mean he could have easily said\n\n01:06:55.640 --> 01:06:56.640\nit's awful.\n\n01:06:56.640 --> 01:07:04.200\nI wish it didn't happen and then go away, but, but, but, but he, he, he opened his mouth\n\n01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:09.600\nand put both of his feet in and, uh, it just was like, you read it and you go, what did\n\n01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:11.120\nyou think was good?\n\n01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:18.000\nYou are, whether you think you did it or didn't do what you did, you know what people\n\n01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:21.920\nwill, the public probably thinks about you right now.\n\n01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:28.280\nSo, but, but, but, but, uh, I, we don't, yeah, I, I just don't click on that note.\n\n01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:29.840\nThe context wasn't here.\n\n01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:36.800\nThis is all circling back to like what, and then so Rose, let's just get on a first name\n\n01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:37.800\nbasis with her.\n\n01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:45.720\nSo I stopped saying her last name, um, well, she's like, whatever, like, like really every\n\n01:07:45.720 --> 01:07:55.080\nfucking tweet has to be on fucking point and, and, and I like, we're going to win that game\n\n01:07:55.080 --> 01:07:58.360\nif we play the game of, does everybody have to say everything right?\n\n01:07:58.360 --> 01:08:02.440\nAnd that's exact, I know how confusing that can be for people because we're talking about\n\n01:08:02.440 --> 01:08:05.480\nlike fucking like, don't take this shit anymore.\n\n01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:06.960\nDon't take anybody's bit.\n\n01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:08.600\nThey're going to cloak it in language.\n\n01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:11.760\nThey're going to say, they're going to say that's the way things work and all this stuff\n\n01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:13.960\nand like, so yeah, you know what?\n\n01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:17.160\nI'm hearing myself say it out loud and I'm like, pure wetting back to like, what the\n\n01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:23.080\nfuck am I, why is this my impulse to explain, let me, let me take another run at that and\n\n01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:25.320\ndo it the way that's healthy.\n\n01:08:25.320 --> 01:08:35.720\nWhen I heard that Rose McGowan was catching shit, um, because she made it or didn't like\n\n01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:41.800\nput her toe over a foul line on the, on whatever bowling lane you perceive, like it, it bummed\n\n01:08:41.800 --> 01:08:51.240\nme out because I, it makes me feel like we will never gain traction organically, that\n\n01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:57.720\nwe will create a world in which the only way to, um, uh, change things and, and, and, and\n\n01:08:57.720 --> 01:09:06.000\naccumulate power is to do so artificially and therefore reduce the risk of infraction along\n\n01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:07.000\nthe way.\n\n01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:08.000\nI.\n\n01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:14.520\nWhat do you think, do you think with, with, with something like when, when Rose starts\n\n01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:20.040\nsaying something and yes, she's abrasive, but she's angry and she wants to be listened\n\n01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:21.040\nto.\n\n01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:24.480\nSo of course she's going to be passionate about the stuff that happened to her and, and\n\n01:09:24.480 --> 01:09:25.680\nso whatever.\n\n01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:28.160\nAnd then Twitter locks her down.\n\n01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:33.040\nI mean, doesn't that seem like that's a fear based thing?\n\n01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:37.080\nLike no, we got to, it's like if somebody, if a prisoner is running for the wall, you\n\n01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:42.280\nknow, every, every guard is going to start shooting at it because we can't let that one\n\n01:09:42.280 --> 01:09:44.440\nprisoner get over the fence.\n\n01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:45.440\nYeah.\n\n01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:48.280\nBut if every, but all these other prisoners, if they're just like, they're not going to\n\n01:09:48.280 --> 01:09:53.800\nbe, they're just, if you just stay inside the prison and don't run for the wall.\n\n01:09:53.800 --> 01:09:54.800\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:55.800\nI mean, yeah.\n\n01:09:55.800 --> 01:09:56.800\nYeah.\n\n01:09:56.800 --> 01:10:00.040\nNo, I, I think I know what I'm saying, which is, which is, yeah, but I'm saying, I'm saying\n\n01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:06.120\nlike it is, is like because we're pushing this stuff down or I don't know, I guess when\n\n01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:12.300\nI say we, when, when the world is like pushing this stuff down, it's like, no, we don't want\n\n01:10:12.300 --> 01:10:13.300\nto change.\n\n01:10:13.300 --> 01:10:15.400\nWe don't want to be told we're wrong.\n\n01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:16.400\nYou're wrong.\n\n01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:22.880\nAnd yes, do, do I think that it is harder for revolutionaries to say anything that affects\n\n01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:23.880\npeople?\n\n01:10:23.880 --> 01:10:24.880\nYes.\n\n01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:27.960\nLike it's like so parabolically stacked against people.\n\n01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:32.040\nAnd so then do I, but that's that, but it's, but it's a sign of like the status quo is\n\n01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:40.040\nafraid of this happening that that that's good because changes is happening.\n\n01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:45.880\nThe oil that drives the engine of change is the blood of martyrs because, but just to\n\n01:10:45.880 --> 01:10:51.320\ngo back to my point that I was making before is like the generation, our parents have never\n\n01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:58.720\nbeen more, at least from my point of view, have never been more doubled down and dug\n\n01:10:58.720 --> 01:10:59.720\ninto.\n\n01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:00.720\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:05.400\nThey didn't do anything worse than Clinton and I love our president and he's into Jesus\n\n01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:11.200\nChrist and, and I just ignore all these horrible things that he does because he's better than\n\n01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:17.360\nHillary, the murderer, Hillary, who Pete's a gate, Hillary, she's better than that.\n\n01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:20.720\nAnd we're all going to be rich someday, just like him.\n\n01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:22.720\nAnd he's one of us.\n\n01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:24.360\nSo I'm going to ignore all that.\n\n01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:32.360\nLike you and I, like right now, like at our age, I mean, we're, we're going through like\n\n01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:33.360\nchanges.\n\n01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:34.360\nWe're becoming that.\n\n01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:39.880\nI'm not saying, I'm not saying that we're better than anybody, but I think the one good\n\n01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:46.680\nthing about like the social media stuff, for me, just in terms of like what's happening\n\n01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:53.120\nnow and my, how I feel about like eating meat and, and, and not an animal rights and things\n\n01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:57.280\nlike that and just people rights and, and just being good.\n\n01:11:57.280 --> 01:12:04.720\nAnd it, it, I think that that's the one thing that I think is good is that like at our age\n\n01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:10.120\nwhen we should be digging in and saying, no, I wasn't wrong, we're, we're still changing\n\n01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:11.120\nand evolving.\n\n01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:13.120\nSo I'm trying to put a positive spin on this.\n\n01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:14.120\nNo, that's a good.\n\n01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:15.120\nYeah.\n\n01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:16.120\nThat's, that's, that's better than nothing.\n\n01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:20.080\nI also though, yeah, I want, but yeah, I think you feel more helpless because how do\n\n01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:21.080\nyou change the world?\n\n01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:26.040\nBut I also want to acknowledge that like your, your, your parents and my parents like, like,\n\n01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:29.400\nlike when I was, I was, I was out of the image in my head when you were talking about that\n\n01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:33.720\nand talking about like, when we talk to our parents and like, how they talk about like,\n\n01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:37.560\nwell, you know, when you, you, you get a sense of where they're at politically, which my\n\n01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:44.000\nmom's fucking, well, she probably wouldn't want me to expose her, but she's a, my mom's\n\n01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:45.000\non a fucking point.\n\n01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:50.800\nMy mom's, my mom is like, like crazy, like, like she's like, she's, she's, she's down\n\n01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:52.560\nto clown on the, on the left.\n\n01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:56.720\nBut I think she's kind of like, I don't want to, I don't want to dox her politically.\n\n01:12:56.720 --> 01:12:58.800\nI don't, I don't, I don't know what's going on in her house.\n\n01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:00.880\nI don't know if her and my dad are fighting or what's going on.\n\n01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:03.680\nI don't want to, I don't want to, I've, I've, I've ruined my family with my mouth.\n\n01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:07.240\nI don't, I want to let them have their lives, but, but talking about our parents is important\n\n01:13:07.240 --> 01:13:15.440\nbecause you, you, you, I picture like these, like, um, like, uh, these, like, Brick Brack's\n\n01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:20.440\nlike, like, I picture your mom talking about politics and your dad is like, they're like\n\n01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:24.480\nin this like Midwestern house and there's like little porcelain birds and there's these\n\n01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:29.280\nthings that you grew up around where they're like, who buys a porcelain bird?\n\n01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:32.440\nAnd, and the answer is someone who's got their shit together.\n\n01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:39.440\nBut the whole time now that you and I are their age when they were talking to us, I'll, I'll\n\n01:13:39.440 --> 01:13:43.560\nspeak for myself and say like, now I have a house and even though it doesn't have little\n\n01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:47.640\nporcelain birds in it, there's some equivalent of it that's like a connection that I have\n\n01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:50.640\nto like, oh, this could all go away.\n\n01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:51.640\nYeah.\n\n01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:55.440\nAnd I think that it's hard for us to understand when we think about our parents in the Midwest\n\n01:13:55.440 --> 01:13:59.160\nand their little tract houses with their porcelain birds and their, and their queez and arts\n\n01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:03.040\nand their, and everything's working great and then when they talk about it needs to\n\n01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:06.160\nbe like this or it doesn't need to be like that, like part of, part of how it's easy\n\n01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:11.760\nto clown them is because it seems so clear looking at them that they have nothing to\n\n01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:12.760\nworry about.\n\n01:14:12.760 --> 01:14:13.760\nYeah.\n\n01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:16.600\nAnd then it's like, well, what, what kind of, what, what kind of a build the wall?\n\n01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:18.920\nQEP Newton, like, world do you live in?\n\n01:14:18.920 --> 01:14:19.920\nBuild that wall.\n\n01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:23.080\nSo those Mexicans don't get into Wisconsin.\n\n01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:24.080\nYeah.\n\n01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:25.080\nAnd what?\n\n01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:29.080\nAnd so that you don't affect your plans to watch CSI Miami tomorrow night or whatever\n\n01:14:29.080 --> 01:14:33.040\nlike we laugh at them because we go, yeah, but you're not in the real world because we're\n\n01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:34.680\nyoung city kids.\n\n01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:40.280\nBut we're young city kids who are now turning 45 and we're, I own my own home.\n\n01:14:40.280 --> 01:14:44.480\nAnd for me, I'm like, like I now I have conversations with Duncan Trussell.\n\n01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:48.840\nHe comes back from Burning Man and he starts laying into me with the like, man, you gotta\n\n01:14:48.840 --> 01:14:50.680\njust let it go, baby.\n\n01:14:50.680 --> 01:14:54.800\nAnd I'm like, I do like five years ago, I'd be like, yeah, you got to let it go.\n\n01:14:54.800 --> 01:14:58.920\nLet's do, do you want to do acid next Wednesday or do you want to like, let's talk like, oh,\n\n01:14:58.920 --> 01:14:59.920\nObama's president.\n\n01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:03.640\nSo let's talk about how properties theft and I'll fucking, I'll blow your mind more\n\n01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:04.640\nthan you could blow mine.\n\n01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:12.520\nBut now for real, like it's like, oh, I, I, I have a job and I have a five bedroom house\n\n01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:18.200\nand he comes on, I go on his podcast and he's like, yeah, but why don't you just let some\n\n01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:21.320\npeople hang out here, man?\n\n01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:25.080\nAnd I'm like, I totally should, but seriously, I can't do that.\n\n01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:26.080\nYeah.\n\n01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:30.240\nAnd then I had a whole conversation with him where I was like, that's, I'm my parents.\n\n01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:31.240\nHe's here worried.\n\n01:15:31.240 --> 01:15:35.440\nI just because I don't have a porcelain bird, I mean, like they're worried.\n\n01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:39.440\nPeople are worried about being taken advantage of, you know, like just being, I just got\n\n01:15:39.440 --> 01:15:40.440\nhere.\n\n01:15:40.440 --> 01:15:44.360\nIt's like the Judge Reinhold Fast Times Regiment High thing, but that's, that's the thing.\n\n01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:50.400\nLike whenever anybody calls you privileged or it's a scene in Fast Times, I'm hanging\n\n01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:54.560\non by a thread guidance counselor does this monologue to Judge Reinhold who's still dressed\n\n01:15:54.560 --> 01:15:57.120\nin his fucking pirate fast food outfit.\n\n01:15:57.120 --> 01:16:00.280\nShe says, sorry, but it's time to enroll in a college.\n\n01:16:00.280 --> 01:16:03.160\nLike, like, I don't know where you've been, but the party's over.\n\n01:16:03.160 --> 01:16:07.000\nAnd he's like, you've just watched him the whole movie, like just delivered fast food.\n\n01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:10.960\nAnd he's like, I don't know, he does some mini monologue back that's like, fuck you that\n\n01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:13.240\nwinded the party starter, whatever.\n\n01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:18.560\nThat is how somebody that you wouldn't believe you're like you with your porcelain birds.\n\n01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:20.400\nWhy are you talking about liberty?\n\n01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:21.840\nWhy are you talking about anything?\n\n01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:22.840\nYeah.\n\n01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:23.840\nWhy are you in this conversation?\n\n01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:27.720\nYou're just patriotic about porcelain birds, like they're cheap.\n\n01:16:27.720 --> 01:16:30.000\nYou get them at home depot.\n\n01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:31.000\nYou already own them.\n\n01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:32.440\nYou're not buying anything.\n\n01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:36.320\nYou're watching a fucking television with America playing across it.\n\n01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:37.400\nYou're almost dead.\n\n01:16:37.400 --> 01:16:38.720\nYou saved for your medical bills.\n\n01:16:38.720 --> 01:16:41.160\nNow they're going to shoot them into you, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.\n\n01:16:41.160 --> 01:16:45.800\nLike we look at, I look at older people and I judge them like, like, like, why are they,\n\n01:16:45.800 --> 01:16:49.000\nwhy do they have so much control over what's going on?\n\n01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:56.520\nI get the feeling lately, like 25 year olds see me that way, that they think that they're\n\n01:16:56.520 --> 01:17:00.760\nlooking at what I have as more permanent than I am looking at it.\n\n01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:08.280\nI feel like I am five minutes from, depending on which way the wind blows, one committee\n\n01:17:08.280 --> 01:17:14.520\nor another dressed in one color jumpsuit or another coming up to my door and saying,\n\n01:17:14.520 --> 01:17:18.400\nlike, you didn't earn this house, you don't get to have this.\n\n01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:24.360\nThis is, we're changing the name of this state where you, you, you, you, we, we just found\n\n01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:30.240\nyour name on a, on a Google list that like, oh, we didn't know you were into feet.\n\n01:17:30.240 --> 01:17:37.040\nLike that's, that's, that's a sign of, of ISIS now, whether it was right wing, left\n\n01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:45.840\nwing, west wing or, or young Sheldon, whatever hit show, I live constantly going like they're\n\n01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:46.840\ngoing to come get me.\n\n01:17:46.840 --> 01:17:49.840\nYeah, I think, I feel that way.\n\n01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:51.040\nAnd so what if our parents feel that way?\n\n01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:52.280\nI'm sure they do feel that way.\n\n01:17:52.280 --> 01:17:59.880\nI mean, that's because that's, you know, every email from my relatives for like, look at\n\n01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:04.320\nwhat, look at what the, when Obama was president, you know, look what they're, look what these\n\n01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:07.160\npeople are doing, you know, we're going to have to work hard and we're going to have\n\n01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:14.080\nto pay for some lazy, poor person, uh, their medical bills.\n\n01:18:14.080 --> 01:18:15.160\nWhy should we do that?\n\n01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:21.800\nYou know, and it's, they're worried that they're going to be taken advantage of, I,\n\n01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:27.120\nyou know, or their stuff being taken away, their, their birds are going to be taken away.\n\n01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:29.000\nNobody wants your fucking birds.\n\n01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:36.760\nIt's just, it's crazy because my parents and my family are so religious.\n\n01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:43.880\nThey go to church like three times a week and it's one book, you know, what, haven't\n\n01:18:43.880 --> 01:18:45.080\nyou read it already?\n\n01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:48.880\nWhat else are you going to find out new about the Bible?\n\n01:18:48.880 --> 01:18:53.480\nYou know, somebody, oh, they just found some new discoveries, found a couple of new pages\n\n01:18:53.480 --> 01:18:54.480\nhere.\n\n01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:59.960\nIt looks like carrots are, are not as holy as we thought they were.\n\n01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:00.960\nThat is fucking insane.\n\n01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:01.960\nI mean, it's one fucking book.\n\n01:19:01.960 --> 01:19:05.640\nNow that we know there are people who have done a podcast where it's like 200 episodes\n\n01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:11.880\nof a podcast where their gimmick was they're going to watch grownups to every, we've demystified\n\n01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:16.840\nthe idea of going through Star Wars one minute at a time.\n\n01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:22.520\nThe entire like trilogy and, and all of the trilogies and there's people still going to\n\n01:19:22.520 --> 01:19:28.040\nchurch every week going, it's just such a big book and it's so complicated.\n\n01:19:28.040 --> 01:19:30.280\nLike I wonder what part we'll talk about this time.\n\n01:19:30.280 --> 01:19:34.160\nDo you want to, do you want to, you know what, there's, there's, there's, there's, right,\n\n01:19:34.160 --> 01:19:35.160\nright.\n\n01:19:35.160 --> 01:19:41.000\nI was, I've spent the last 10 years like, oh, don't my colleagues all are like, I, I'm\n\n01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:42.000\nJoseph Campbell.\n\n01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:45.720\nSo I'll stick up for Christianity, but like I'm saying, yeah, the American like Midwestern\n\n01:19:45.720 --> 01:19:50.280\nchurch, like culture where it's like, this is fucking ridiculous.\n\n01:19:50.280 --> 01:19:54.360\nWe were pretending that we haven't had the chance to look through that book from cover\n\n01:19:54.360 --> 01:19:55.360\nto cover.\n\n01:19:55.360 --> 01:19:56.360\nYeah.\n\n01:19:56.360 --> 01:19:57.360\nI mean, come on.\n\n01:19:57.360 --> 01:19:58.360\nSome parts are boring.\n\n01:19:58.360 --> 01:20:00.160\nIt's the Old Testament does a lot of begets.\n\n01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:02.200\nLike I've tried going through this thing.\n\n01:20:02.200 --> 01:20:04.800\nIt's okay to say it's a boring book.\n\n01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:07.040\nIt's also, you haven't read the whole thing.\n\n01:20:07.040 --> 01:20:08.040\nYeah.\n\n01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:10.960\nI mean, it's crazy that they, they, it's a book that you haven't read.\n\n01:20:10.960 --> 01:20:15.000\nThat has huge boring parts that you could read and like not understand.\n\n01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:19.240\nAnd then, and then you go to a building and the guy says, today we're going to talk about\n\n01:20:19.240 --> 01:20:24.000\nwhat this thing, this doesn't make any sense at all.\n\n01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:29.480\nIf you just read the words, if you read the words is beget and vow and above, above, above.\n\n01:20:29.480 --> 01:20:35.160\nNobody talks like that and nobody, you know, nobody lives to be 500 and the cool ones are\n\n01:20:35.160 --> 01:20:39.200\nthe ones that go like, so here's what Jesus is saying just cause it doesn't make any sense\n\n01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:41.200\nwhen we read it.\n\n01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:43.400\nIt's like an English teacher taking you through Macbeth.\n\n01:20:43.400 --> 01:20:45.920\nMacbeth is saying, hey, be cool.\n\n01:20:45.920 --> 01:20:48.640\nYou know, like, and then we're all like, whoa, wow, thanks for teaching us.\n\n01:20:48.640 --> 01:20:55.560\nYou do that for four years and you do that for four years in, in high school and then\n\n01:20:55.560 --> 01:21:01.240\nyou're done with it and then maybe you'll see the movie, but these people go every fucking\n\n01:21:01.240 --> 01:21:07.480\nweek and really like, should he say like, okay, listen, don't be a dick to each other.\n\n01:21:07.480 --> 01:21:08.480\nClass dismissed.\n\n01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:11.200\nOkay, we're going to take the rest of the summer off.\n\n01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:13.280\nDon't be an asshole to each other.\n\n01:21:13.280 --> 01:21:18.520\nWell in my doubt, here's the, here's the threat and that's why like, yeah, I, we saw Jesus\n\n01:21:18.520 --> 01:21:23.160\nChrist Superstar like, like when we were like in our twenties and like, I got really into\n\n01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:24.160\nit.\n\n01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:25.160\nI was like, oh shit, man.\n\n01:21:25.160 --> 01:21:26.160\nThis is a great musical.\n\n01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:27.160\nLike I love these songs.\n\n01:21:27.160 --> 01:21:28.160\nYeah.\n\n01:21:28.160 --> 01:21:32.640\nAnd then because the song sounded so good, I like, I started watching more discovery\n\n01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:37.240\nchannel shows about Jesus and reading the stuff that Campbell said about Jesus and like,\n\n01:21:37.240 --> 01:21:41.080\nI still haven't really gotten cover to cover it through the New Testament, but I feel like\n\n01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:44.800\nI know Jesus a little bit better than a lot of people that get paid a lot of money to\n\n01:21:44.800 --> 01:21:45.800\nsay they know Jesus.\n\n01:21:45.800 --> 01:21:46.800\nYeah.\n\n01:21:46.800 --> 01:21:49.920\nAnd that's the reason why I think because it's not a complicated myth.\n\n01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:50.920\nNo.\n\n01:21:50.920 --> 01:21:51.920\nIt's, it's very nuanced.\n\n01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:56.800\nThere's a lot of room for exploration and constant talk about it, but it is pretty much\n\n01:21:56.800 --> 01:22:05.840\ndiehard except, uh, instead of being afraid to fly, he's sort of afraid to die, um, and\n\n01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:10.840\nthe Nakatomi Plaza is, uh, is, uh, the Sermon on the Mount.\n\n01:22:10.840 --> 01:22:11.840\nSure.\n\n01:22:11.840 --> 01:22:12.840\nRight?\n\n01:22:12.840 --> 01:22:13.840\nI don't know.\n\n01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:16.840\nI don't know the Bible or Bible.\n\n01:22:16.840 --> 01:22:19.520\nWait, didn't you go through a biblical, weren't you raised?\n\n01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:20.520\nNo, I know the Bible.\n\n01:22:20.520 --> 01:22:21.520\nYeah.\n\n01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:24.200\nNo, I was what Rob was saying really quick that I think for the same reason as you is\n\n01:22:24.200 --> 01:22:28.360\nbecause I do encounter a lot of Christians and it's like, wait, don't I know more about\n\n01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:31.640\nthe Bible than you and shouldn't I not know more about the Bible than you?\n\n01:22:31.640 --> 01:22:32.640\nBecause there's a block.\n\n01:22:32.640 --> 01:22:33.640\nYeah.\n\n01:22:33.640 --> 01:22:34.640\nBecause they're not actually studying.\n\n01:22:34.640 --> 01:22:36.240\nThey're just studying it.\n\n01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:43.440\nThey're, they're told if you go to church every, every Sunday and keep saying, I believe\n\n01:22:43.440 --> 01:22:44.440\nin Jesus.\n\n01:22:44.440 --> 01:22:45.440\nI believe in Jesus.\n\n01:22:45.440 --> 01:22:51.040\nWhen you die, you get to have ice cream forever and your favorite television show will play\n\n01:22:51.040 --> 01:22:56.360\non a loop and you'll see all of your old pets and your family and you'll be able to\n\n01:22:56.360 --> 01:22:58.720\nhang out with Lincoln in heaven and stuff like that.\n\n01:22:58.720 --> 01:23:02.400\nBut keep in mind, there's a Muslim version of all this stuff that you'll be laughing\n\n01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:07.640\nat when someone tells you they read on a bubblegum wrapper that that's what they believe.\n\n01:23:07.640 --> 01:23:15.280\nAnd that's why the minute, the minute, you know, the minute you, you say like, well,\n\n01:23:15.280 --> 01:23:17.800\nwhy don't you, why don't you help the poor?\n\n01:23:17.800 --> 01:23:24.480\nI mean, because I mean, isn't, didn't God or Jesus say do unto others as you would do\n\n01:23:24.480 --> 01:23:25.480\nunto yourself?\n\n01:23:25.480 --> 01:23:26.480\nWouldn't you help?\n\n01:23:26.480 --> 01:23:30.520\nWouldn't you, you're giving 10% of your paycheck to the church.\n\n01:23:30.520 --> 01:23:35.280\nWhy isn't the church full of homeless people during the other six days?\n\n01:23:35.280 --> 01:23:36.880\nIt's not being used.\n\n01:23:36.880 --> 01:23:39.520\nWhy, why it doesn't pay taxes.\n\n01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:45.240\nWhy can't you, why is really, can't you give some of this money so we can all have affordable\n\n01:23:45.240 --> 01:23:48.120\nbecause everybody gets sick.\n\n01:23:48.120 --> 01:23:49.120\nEverybody dies.\n\n01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:51.200\nNobody wants to have their loved ones.\n\n01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:52.200\nWhat is it?\n\n01:23:52.200 --> 01:23:53.200\nShouldn't you be going?\n\n01:23:53.200 --> 01:23:54.200\nYes.\n\n01:23:54.200 --> 01:23:55.200\nTake all of our money.\n\n01:23:55.200 --> 01:23:59.640\nThe least popular thing Jesus ever said was sell all your stuff and follow me.\n\n01:23:59.640 --> 01:24:00.640\nYeah.\n\n01:24:00.640 --> 01:24:01.640\nGive it to the poor.\n\n01:24:01.640 --> 01:24:02.640\nYeah.\n\n01:24:02.640 --> 01:24:03.640\nNo one likes talking about that.\n\n01:24:03.640 --> 01:24:04.640\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:05.640\nBecause they don't want to give up their fucking birds.\n\n01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:06.640\nRight.\n\n01:24:06.640 --> 01:24:07.640\nNeither did the rich man.\n\n01:24:07.640 --> 01:24:08.640\nRight.\n\n01:24:08.640 --> 01:24:09.640\nHe went away sad at the same time.\n\n01:24:09.640 --> 01:24:11.800\nHe went away sad because, ah, that, I mean, I, I, I can't do it.\n\n01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:16.000\nI'm not, I'm not, I'm not killing anybody and I don't, I don't, I don't know.\n\n01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:19.080\nYou know, I said, wouldn't it be nice to have a third Testament where it's a, or, or like\n\n01:24:19.080 --> 01:24:24.120\na, or like a two point five where it's like, it's, it's, it's like, hey, uh, I gotta, because\n\n01:24:24.120 --> 01:24:28.280\nI, I, I've stood in a microphone and said, hey, I think capitalism might be the root\n\n01:24:28.280 --> 01:24:30.240\nof a lot of our problems that we're having.\n\n01:24:30.240 --> 01:24:35.640\nLike the idea that everything has a price seems to keep trickling sideways over into\n\n01:24:35.640 --> 01:24:40.040\nthese stories you scratch your heads about where the cost of a bullet is less than the\n\n01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:41.760\ncost of killing a black child.\n\n01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:42.760\nYeah.\n\n01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:46.040\nLike, like, hasn't capitalism and its heart doesn't, it ends up getting us here.\n\n01:24:46.040 --> 01:24:50.880\nAnd then, you know, like, like, like the Reddit the next day, like, well, if you hate capitalism\n\n01:24:50.880 --> 01:24:56.720\nso much, wouldn't we know that you meant that by you giving your house away and eating\n\n01:24:56.720 --> 01:25:03.040\nyour own foot, I don't, I, what I would like is for a guy to come up to Jesus in the New\n\n01:25:03.040 --> 01:25:08.720\nTestament and say, hey, listen, uh, must be nice, son of God, hey, I never said I was\n\n01:25:08.720 --> 01:25:09.720\nthe son of God.\n\n01:25:09.720 --> 01:25:10.720\nYeah.\n\n01:25:10.720 --> 01:25:11.720\nI heard that's your shtick.\n\n01:25:11.720 --> 01:25:12.720\nYeah.\n\n01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:13.720\nI'm not, I don't know.\n\n01:25:13.720 --> 01:25:14.720\nYou do keep saying that you're, you do keep saying.\n\n01:25:14.720 --> 01:25:15.720\nThat's what you said.\n\n01:25:15.720 --> 01:25:16.720\nI never said that.\n\n01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:17.720\nI never said that.\n\n01:25:17.720 --> 01:25:25.560\nBut you are living a very rarefied life right now, uh, uh, yes, I am.\n\n01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:30.080\nBut you know, uh, I just do what I do.\n\n01:25:30.080 --> 01:25:31.080\nOkay.\n\n01:25:31.080 --> 01:25:32.080\nSo I do what I do.\n\n01:25:32.080 --> 01:25:33.080\nThat's what my teacher said.\n\n01:25:33.080 --> 01:25:35.720\nAnd the whole New Testament is why it's an inspiring story is because it's like, what\n\n01:25:35.720 --> 01:25:39.440\nif you woke up the next day and you just fucking did that?\n\n01:25:39.440 --> 01:25:43.560\nWhat if you just calls it like you see it, walk around and the answer is, according to\n\n01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:47.960\nthat book, some people will come up to you and say, but I'm a police officer.\n\n01:25:47.960 --> 01:25:49.400\nWhat would you want me to do?\n\n01:25:49.400 --> 01:25:51.800\nAnd you would say, Hey man, what's police?\n\n01:25:51.800 --> 01:25:52.800\nWhat's an officer?\n\n01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:56.960\nAnd he would like drop his spear and like, and like freak out and I'm not making fun\n\n01:25:56.960 --> 01:25:57.960\nof it.\n\n01:25:57.960 --> 01:26:03.200\nLike I, I, I, what, if that's not the thing that's going to change shit, what is, by the\n\n01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:07.760\nway, encountering some dude who fucking blows your mind and there's, you know, why can't\n\n01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:11.320\nthe answer be, I don't know.\n\n01:26:11.320 --> 01:26:13.840\nI have, I've worked my whole life.\n\n01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:15.040\nI've been told my whole life.\n\n01:26:15.040 --> 01:26:19.720\nSo, uh, so you're saying like from the, from the New Christ, yeah, why can't the answer\n\n01:26:19.720 --> 01:26:22.680\nbe, Hey man, I'm not sure.\n\n01:26:22.680 --> 01:26:23.680\nI don't know.\n\n01:26:23.680 --> 01:26:25.480\nI'm just trying to get by like everybody else.\n\n01:26:25.480 --> 01:26:31.880\nAnd the answer is because it would be a decentralized, non hierarchical, like modern compliant myth\n\n01:26:31.880 --> 01:26:36.840\nabout all of you instead of a protagonist in the story, who's some dude that we're supposed\n\n01:26:36.840 --> 01:26:37.840\nto like be like.\n\n01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:42.640\nAnd if we're not like him, then we fucked up like that it's just a story as it was originally\n\n01:26:42.640 --> 01:26:43.640\nintended.\n\n01:26:43.640 --> 01:26:49.160\nI would believe about what if you, what if you just, what if, if you give a mouse a cookie,\n\n01:26:49.160 --> 01:26:52.760\njust the millennials that, you know, all right, no, let's not get off on that.\n\n01:26:52.760 --> 01:26:56.840\nLike this idea, like, like, you know what happens if you wake up one day and you start\n\n01:26:56.840 --> 01:27:00.920\ncausing it, like you seize it, you only live to about 33 and then they nail you to a piece\n\n01:27:00.920 --> 01:27:02.080\nof wood.\n\n01:27:02.080 --> 01:27:06.680\nThat's like, that, that, but you get to meet, you get to meet David Bowie, uh, like, like\n\n01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:10.920\nyou, you, you, I, it beats prostate cancer.\n\n01:27:10.920 --> 01:27:16.280\nI don't know what to tell you, Mac, like, like, who else was crucified on Golgotha?\n\n01:27:16.280 --> 01:27:18.120\nLike what, who are these other people?\n\n01:27:18.120 --> 01:27:19.480\nDid they snatch purses?\n\n01:27:19.480 --> 01:27:21.160\nWere they also God Kim?\n\n01:27:21.160 --> 01:27:24.360\nDid they, did they threaten the fate of Judea?\n\n01:27:24.360 --> 01:27:28.800\nI don't know what I, like, like what I'm saying to you is, yes, it's true.\n\n01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:29.800\nIt's very true.\n\n01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:34.840\nIf you were to start searching your conscience before you reacted to anything ever, it's true.\n\n01:27:34.840 --> 01:27:38.200\nYour path could be absolutely uncontrollably short.\n\n01:27:38.200 --> 01:27:42.440\nYou could end up out of work on Wednesday and under a bridge on Thursday and, uh, not\n\n01:27:42.440 --> 01:27:46.840\nin an intervention episode and you could just like be a pile of bones in a sewer next to\n\n01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:52.120\nTim Curry, just as a clown floating, uh, and, and not, but not even acknowledged in the final\n\n01:27:52.120 --> 01:27:53.560\ntally of who floats.\n\n01:27:53.560 --> 01:27:54.560\nOh, okay.\n\n01:27:54.560 --> 01:27:58.800\nWell, like when Tim Curry would say they all float, he might exclude you to just to add,\n\n01:27:58.800 --> 01:28:01.080\nI just want to make sure this is a nightmare scenario.\n\n01:28:01.080 --> 01:28:04.040\nI don't even want your bones in Tim Curry's float catalog.\n\n01:28:04.040 --> 01:28:05.040\nRight.\n\n01:28:05.040 --> 01:28:06.920\nWhen he says they all, you'll float too.\n\n01:28:06.920 --> 01:28:08.680\nHe's not talking about you.\n\n01:28:08.680 --> 01:28:10.160\nYou'll just be, you'll be, you'll be bones.\n\n01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:11.160\nHe didn't even know.\n\n01:28:11.160 --> 01:28:14.520\nWell, what if he's just starting out?\n\n01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:17.760\nYou know, I mean, he says, uh, you'll float too.\n\n01:28:17.760 --> 01:28:19.440\nOh, sorry, Timmy.\n\n01:28:19.440 --> 01:28:20.440\nYou know what?\n\n01:28:20.440 --> 01:28:22.520\nI said earlier, you'd float too.\n\n01:28:22.520 --> 01:28:27.040\nI meant the royal you, the second person.\n\n01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:28.760\nWe're hoping to get some others.\n\n01:28:28.760 --> 01:28:30.600\nI got a couple of other kids.\n\n01:28:30.600 --> 01:28:34.200\nIt's like when Uncle Sam says he wants you, he doesn't want you, Timmy.\n\n01:28:34.200 --> 01:28:36.360\nYou might be, you might have flat feet.\n\n01:28:36.360 --> 01:28:37.760\nI just started out here.\n\n01:28:37.760 --> 01:28:42.600\nWhether you float or not depends largely on your methane content, your fear, whatever\n\n01:28:42.600 --> 01:28:43.600\nyou were afraid of.\n\n01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:45.440\nListen, it's raining.\n\n01:28:45.440 --> 01:28:47.240\nI'm getting pretty wet down here.\n\n01:28:47.240 --> 01:28:48.240\nAre you in or out?\n\n01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:49.240\nCome on down.\n\n01:28:49.240 --> 01:28:50.240\nYou'll float.\n\n01:28:50.240 --> 01:28:51.240\nAre you going to float?\n\n01:28:51.240 --> 01:28:52.240\nYou'll float too.\n\n01:28:52.240 --> 01:28:53.240\nI mean that figuratively.\n\n01:28:53.240 --> 01:28:54.240\nIt's not a litigatable phrase.\n\n01:28:54.240 --> 01:28:55.240\nYou'll float too.\n\n01:28:55.240 --> 01:28:56.240\nYeah.\n\n01:28:56.240 --> 01:28:57.240\nIn or out.\n\n01:28:57.240 --> 01:28:59.000\nI just, I copyright wrote the, the, the, the slogan.\n\n01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:07.120\nI mean, what the second kid, it'll make sense, but you, can you just, uh, uh, Patrick\n\n01:29:07.120 --> 01:29:10.880\nlistener here, couldn't you have started like this and given me 90 minutes of this?\n\n01:29:10.880 --> 01:29:12.200\nYou have in the past.\n\n01:29:12.200 --> 01:29:15.480\nVery funny this riffing about it.\n\n01:29:15.480 --> 01:29:23.040\nIf I wanted to listen to thoughts about your politic, your rambling rants about, uh, women,\n\n01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:33.800\nI could have listened to, uh, I don't, um, yes, Paul, you, you were, you were, are you\n\n01:29:33.800 --> 01:29:34.800\nokay?\n\n01:29:34.800 --> 01:29:38.240\nPaul, what's the matter?\n\n01:29:38.240 --> 01:29:39.640\nYou said, you, you stopped right there.\n\n01:29:39.640 --> 01:29:45.200\nHe said you were going to listen to somebody and now you're, are you giggling or are you,\n\n01:29:45.200 --> 01:29:46.200\nwhat are you doing?\n\n01:29:46.200 --> 01:29:47.800\nYou will all join me.\n\n01:29:47.800 --> 01:29:48.800\nYou will all join me.\n\n01:29:48.800 --> 01:29:49.800\nNo, I didn't say that.\n\n01:29:49.800 --> 01:29:51.000\nThat was a dumb direction to take that.\n\n01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:52.800\nOh, Paul, you were doing a best.\n\n01:29:52.800 --> 01:29:53.800\nYeah.\n\n01:29:53.800 --> 01:29:54.800\nNo, the other podcast, I don't know.\n\n01:29:54.800 --> 01:29:57.640\nI wanted to throw, I don't want to, uh, I could listen to another podcast.\n\n01:29:57.640 --> 01:29:58.640\nRight.\n\n01:29:58.640 --> 01:29:59.640\nYou could.\n\n01:29:59.640 --> 01:30:01.680\nAnd yet you're here.\n\n01:30:01.680 --> 01:30:03.960\nBut I paid.\n\n01:30:03.960 --> 01:30:04.960\nYou right?\n\n01:30:04.960 --> 01:30:06.520\nI'm a, I'm a streaming subscriber.\n\n01:30:06.520 --> 01:30:09.440\nRight.\n\n01:30:09.440 --> 01:30:10.440\nAnd you're here.\n\n01:30:10.440 --> 01:30:12.440\nWell, I expect better next week.\n\n01:30:12.440 --> 01:30:14.440\nWell, guess what?\n\n01:30:14.440 --> 01:30:17.040\nWhat, what, what, what?\n\n01:30:17.040 --> 01:30:20.920\nYou're going to get what you're going to get because it's, it's, it's, it's, this is what\n\n01:30:20.920 --> 01:30:21.920\nyou signed up for.\n\n01:30:21.920 --> 01:30:26.120\nSo you expect me to give you $5 a month in exchange to whatever happens?\n\n01:30:26.120 --> 01:30:28.440\nUh, that's what you signed up for.\n\n01:30:28.440 --> 01:30:29.440\nYeah.\n\n01:30:29.440 --> 01:30:30.440\nMm hmm.\n\n01:30:30.440 --> 01:30:31.440\nMm hmm.\n\n01:30:31.440 --> 01:30:33.440\nHave you guys noticed how nice Spencer's shorts are?\n\n01:30:33.440 --> 01:30:34.440\nLook at those shorts.\n\n01:30:34.440 --> 01:30:35.440\nOh.\n\n01:30:35.440 --> 01:30:36.440\nAre those from Bombfell?\n\n01:30:36.440 --> 01:30:37.440\nI don't know.\n\n01:30:37.440 --> 01:30:38.440\nThey look like they could be.\n\n01:30:38.440 --> 01:30:41.440\nBombfell has high quality clothes delivered directly to your.\n\n01:30:41.440 --> 01:30:42.440\nAre you shitting me?\n\n01:30:42.440 --> 01:30:43.440\nIs that a segue?\n\n01:30:43.440 --> 01:30:44.440\nNo, it's not.\n\n01:30:44.440 --> 01:30:45.440\nDid you really?\n\n01:30:45.440 --> 01:30:46.440\nNo.\n\n01:30:46.440 --> 01:30:47.440\nOh my God.\n\n01:30:47.440 --> 01:30:48.440\nI was like, wow, that was smooth.\n\n01:30:48.440 --> 01:30:49.440\nAll right.\n\n01:30:49.440 --> 01:30:50.440\nI'm your dick.\n\n01:30:50.440 --> 01:30:52.440\nI just wanted to do that.\n\n01:30:52.440 --> 01:30:53.440\nIt's a 943.\n\n01:30:53.440 --> 01:30:57.440\nSo if we were going to play D&D, we have the out that Jeff's not here.\n\n01:30:57.440 --> 01:30:59.440\nSo we don't have to play D&D and we could just wrap up.\n\n01:30:59.440 --> 01:31:02.440\nDo you want to, do you want Kate to play D&D?\n\n01:31:02.440 --> 01:31:03.440\nMy wife?\n\n01:31:03.440 --> 01:31:09.440\nGood question after talking about how we should respect women for 90 minutes.\n\n01:31:09.440 --> 01:31:11.440\nShe's really good at magic cards.\n\n01:31:11.440 --> 01:31:12.440\nWe don't even have it.\n\n01:31:12.440 --> 01:31:13.440\nShe's really good at magic.\n\n01:31:13.440 --> 01:31:15.440\nI mean, I was talking to Kelly last night.\n\n01:31:15.440 --> 01:31:18.440\nShe hasn't been playing that long, if I understand, but really, really good.\n\n01:31:18.440 --> 01:31:21.440\nShe's been kicking your ass is what I've been hearing.\n\n01:31:21.440 --> 01:31:23.440\nI'd say, I mean.\n\n01:31:23.440 --> 01:31:28.440\nI know you were saying the other week, I want to play magic with your wife.\n\n01:31:28.440 --> 01:31:29.440\nWith your wife.\n\n01:31:29.440 --> 01:31:30.440\nYeah.\n\n01:31:30.440 --> 01:31:36.440\nThe next weekend, Kate is like, I'm going to play magic with Spencer.\n\n01:31:36.440 --> 01:31:39.440\nAnd I was like, well, he won.\n\n01:31:39.440 --> 01:31:40.440\nI'm not.\n\n01:31:40.440 --> 01:31:41.440\nHe won.\n\n01:31:41.440 --> 01:31:42.440\nThe ultimate magic move.\n\n01:31:42.440 --> 01:31:45.440\nI don't play against a lot of good players.\n\n01:31:45.440 --> 01:31:48.440\nWhy is Kate the best magic player?\n\n01:31:48.440 --> 01:31:49.440\nI don't know.\n\n01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:50.440\nIt's weird.\n\n01:31:50.440 --> 01:31:53.440\nUsually when you teach someone to play magic, they follow a very slow progression.\n\n01:31:53.440 --> 01:31:58.440\nAnd it's very frustrating to play with new magic players because they don't seem to catch\n\n01:31:58.440 --> 01:31:59.440\non very quick.\n\n01:31:59.440 --> 01:32:02.440\nBut she might, like Zach is the other guy who's good.\n\n01:32:02.440 --> 01:32:03.440\nAnd then Ryan, we play with.\n\n01:32:03.440 --> 01:32:04.440\nRyan's probably the best.\n\n01:32:04.440 --> 01:32:08.440\nBut I think she might be better than Zach, which is saying something because presumably\n\n01:32:08.440 --> 01:32:09.440\nZach taught her to play.\n\n01:32:09.440 --> 01:32:12.440\nIt's hard to surpass a teacher that quick.\n\n01:32:12.440 --> 01:32:15.440\nAnd that's your Darth Vader, which Kate is.\n\n01:32:15.440 --> 01:32:16.440\nRight.\n\n01:32:16.440 --> 01:32:17.440\nYeah.\n\n01:32:17.440 --> 01:32:18.440\nBut here's the thing.\n\n01:32:18.440 --> 01:32:27.440\nI think Kate has this almost magical ability to find stuff.\n\n01:32:27.440 --> 01:32:31.440\nAnd I think it's because there's cards and it's supernatural.\n\n01:32:31.440 --> 01:32:34.440\nLike she's better at finding like keys and things.\n\n01:32:34.440 --> 01:32:35.440\nWell, yeah.\n\n01:32:35.440 --> 01:32:36.440\nAbsolutely.\n\n01:32:36.440 --> 01:32:37.440\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:32:37.440 --> 01:32:38.440\nAnd assuming that that's supernatural.\n\n01:32:38.440 --> 01:32:40.440\nI'll go.\n\n01:32:40.440 --> 01:32:43.440\nThis happens like five times a day.\n\n01:32:43.440 --> 01:32:44.440\nFuck.\n\n01:32:44.440 --> 01:32:46.440\nI got to let the dog out or I'm gonna be late for my meeting.\n\n01:32:46.440 --> 01:32:47.440\nI can't find my keys.\n\n01:32:47.440 --> 01:32:51.440\nDo you want me to help you find your keys?\n\n01:32:51.440 --> 01:32:52.440\nNo.\n\n01:32:52.440 --> 01:32:54.440\nI can find my own keys.\n\n01:32:54.440 --> 01:32:55.440\nKate.\n\n01:32:55.440 --> 01:32:56.440\nI can find my own keys.\n\n01:32:56.440 --> 01:32:57.440\nWhere are my keys?\n\n01:32:57.440 --> 01:32:58.440\nWhere are my keys?\n\n01:32:58.440 --> 01:32:59.440\nWhere are my keys?\n\n01:32:59.440 --> 01:33:00.440\nWhere are my keys?\n\n01:33:00.440 --> 01:33:01.440\nDo you want me?\n\n01:33:01.440 --> 01:33:02.440\nYeah.\n\n01:33:02.440 --> 01:33:03.440\nThey're right here.\n\n01:33:03.440 --> 01:33:05.440\nShe always she could find anything.\n\n01:33:05.440 --> 01:33:07.440\nShe's got excellent finding skills.\n\n01:33:07.440 --> 01:33:11.440\nWhen I was married to McGathey, so she's the source of this or someone else's.\n\n01:33:11.440 --> 01:33:12.440\nBut she sold.\n\n01:33:12.440 --> 01:33:13.440\nI didn't need shells.\n\n01:33:13.440 --> 01:33:16.440\nI didn't decide that this was a thing.\n\n01:33:16.440 --> 01:33:20.440\nThanks because this is like declarations of but I had heard a thing that I didn't directly\n\n01:33:20.440 --> 01:33:25.440\nread about women being better scanners.\n\n01:33:25.440 --> 01:33:31.440\nVisually that could have come from the pages of hustler.\n\n01:33:31.440 --> 01:33:32.440\nI don't know.\n\n01:33:32.440 --> 01:33:37.440\nMy mom said there's male pattern blindness and that's why guys can never find things and\n\n01:33:37.440 --> 01:33:38.440\nwomen can't find them.\n\n01:33:38.440 --> 01:33:43.440\nSomething about like the idea was I'm not pushing this forth and saying I believe it.\n\n01:33:43.440 --> 01:33:49.440\nI'm saying I found this in the bamboo forest of my mind because someone put it there.\n\n01:33:49.440 --> 01:33:51.440\nIt was a thing that came up at some point.\n\n01:33:51.440 --> 01:33:55.440\nThe idea that women because I've experienced the same thing.\n\n01:33:55.440 --> 01:33:56.440\nYeah.\n\n01:33:56.440 --> 01:34:02.440\nBut with more than one like I like I'm like where and then they get involved and then\n\n01:34:02.440 --> 01:34:05.440\nit's immediately very quickly.\n\n01:34:05.440 --> 01:34:09.440\nAnd it's embarrassing because it's like on a shoe and you're like but that's a shoe\n\n01:34:09.440 --> 01:34:10.440\nand the keys.\n\n01:34:10.440 --> 01:34:11.440\nYeah.\n\n01:34:11.440 --> 01:34:16.440\nThe idea was that this is so counter to everything that we said that women can like\n\n01:34:16.440 --> 01:34:22.440\ntake a Robocop like snapshot in a second and they see everything at once.\n\n01:34:22.440 --> 01:34:27.440\nI bet that's got to be because that just feeds into the ideas that they're like.\n\n01:34:27.440 --> 01:34:32.440\nIt's the only woman that I've ever met that could do it to this degree.\n\n01:34:32.440 --> 01:34:38.440\nAnd I think she's also it doesn't surprise me that she's good at magic cards.\n\n01:34:38.440 --> 01:34:43.440\nSo and also she plays to win.\n\n01:34:43.440 --> 01:34:44.440\nRight.\n\n01:34:44.440 --> 01:34:47.440\nShe plays to win.\n\n01:34:47.440 --> 01:34:50.440\nI don't like games because it's not.\n\n01:34:50.440 --> 01:34:51.440\nI don't like competition.\n\n01:34:51.440 --> 01:34:52.440\nI don't think it's it's fun.\n\n01:34:52.440 --> 01:34:54.440\nI don't like I don't play to win.\n\n01:34:54.440 --> 01:34:55.440\nI don't like losing.\n\n01:34:55.440 --> 01:34:56.440\nI see.\n\n01:34:56.440 --> 01:34:58.440\nI don't mind losing.\n\n01:34:58.440 --> 01:35:00.440\nI don't have it in me to go.\n\n01:35:00.440 --> 01:35:01.440\nI have to win.\n\n01:35:01.440 --> 01:35:02.440\nRight.\n\n01:35:02.440 --> 01:35:08.440\nBecause I go if I lose bucket it's it's how fun is this anyway.\n\n01:35:08.440 --> 01:35:11.440\nBut Kate is more.\n\n01:35:11.440 --> 01:35:12.440\nNo.\n\n01:35:12.440 --> 01:35:13.440\nI'm winning.\n\n01:35:13.440 --> 01:35:15.440\nI'm trying to I like trying to win.\n\n01:35:15.440 --> 01:35:16.440\nBut I don't.\n\n01:35:16.440 --> 01:35:21.440\nBut I feel bad when if I'm playing a game like.\n\n01:35:21.440 --> 01:35:24.440\nLike like where I feel like the other I can't win.\n\n01:35:24.440 --> 01:35:27.440\nBecause I actually feel bad for the other person.\n\n01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:29.440\nI'm like like Cody taught me connect for it.\n\n01:35:29.440 --> 01:35:31.440\nI was like you can't win.\n\n01:35:31.440 --> 01:35:33.440\nI can't wait to connect for it.\n\n01:35:33.440 --> 01:35:37.440\nBut but but but I also I've won a couple of times.\n\n01:35:37.440 --> 01:35:38.440\nThat's a bad example.\n\n01:35:38.440 --> 01:35:42.440\nLike because it keeps me just going like I'm going to fucking win.\n\n01:35:42.440 --> 01:35:43.440\nThat's what I like.\n\n01:35:43.440 --> 01:35:46.440\nI think it's funny and fun to be like I want to win.\n\n01:35:46.440 --> 01:35:48.440\nThis is the most important thing in the world.\n\n01:35:48.440 --> 01:35:53.440\nBut only if it means that you might kind of maybe believe you have to believe in it.\n\n01:35:53.440 --> 01:35:57.440\nBecause there's some most games I'm so bad at that I can't really.\n\n01:35:57.440 --> 01:35:58.440\nIt's like who are we kidding.\n\n01:35:58.440 --> 01:35:59.440\nI'm not going to win.\n\n01:35:59.440 --> 01:36:00.440\nRight.\n\n01:36:00.440 --> 01:36:01.440\nI feel like you'd be a Scrabble master.\n\n01:36:01.440 --> 01:36:02.440\nNo.\n\n01:36:02.440 --> 01:36:03.440\nThat's what a lot of people think.\n\n01:36:03.440 --> 01:36:05.440\nThat's why you're Pictionary.\n\n01:36:05.440 --> 01:36:06.440\nYeah.\n\n01:36:06.440 --> 01:36:07.440\nYeah.\n\n01:36:07.440 --> 01:36:08.440\nFinally.\n\n01:36:08.440 --> 01:36:10.440\nYou're amazing at Pictionary.\n\n01:36:10.440 --> 01:36:11.440\nNo.\n\n01:36:11.440 --> 01:36:13.440\nI fucking hate Pictionary.\n\n01:36:13.440 --> 01:36:16.440\nAnd I fucking hate Pictionary.\n\n01:36:16.440 --> 01:36:18.440\nDon't ask me to play Pictionary.\n\n01:36:18.440 --> 01:36:21.440\nBecause whenever somebody goes let's play Pictionary.\n\n01:36:21.440 --> 01:36:23.440\nPeople go well Rob's on our team.\n\n01:36:23.440 --> 01:36:26.440\nAnd I was like motherfucker I didn't even say I was going to play.\n\n01:36:26.440 --> 01:36:28.440\nYou didn't even ask.\n\n01:36:28.440 --> 01:36:30.440\nYou're not even looking at me.\n\n01:36:30.440 --> 01:36:31.440\nRob's on my team.\n\n01:36:31.440 --> 01:36:33.440\nRob's on my team.\n\n01:36:33.440 --> 01:36:34.440\nGo fuck yourself.\n\n01:36:34.440 --> 01:36:35.440\nI'm going home.\n\n01:36:35.440 --> 01:36:37.440\nFuck off.\n\n01:36:37.440 --> 01:36:39.440\nFuck off.\n\n01:36:39.440 --> 01:36:41.440\nSeriously go fuck yourself.\n\n01:36:41.440 --> 01:36:43.440\nBut this is like a 20 year old.\n\n01:36:43.440 --> 01:36:46.440\nThe last time I talked about something you used to say all the time.\n\n01:36:46.440 --> 01:36:48.440\nYou were like how long ago was that.\n\n01:36:48.440 --> 01:36:49.440\nExcuse me.\n\n01:36:49.440 --> 01:36:50.440\nIs that an impression.\n\n01:36:50.440 --> 01:36:51.440\nYeah.\n\n01:36:51.440 --> 01:36:52.440\nI knew what you mean.\n\n01:36:52.440 --> 01:36:53.440\nHow long ago.\n\n01:36:53.440 --> 01:36:54.440\nSo yeah.\n\n01:36:54.440 --> 01:36:55.440\nI mean like but you're not thinking about it.\n\n01:36:55.440 --> 01:36:56.440\nYou don't really know.\n\n01:36:56.440 --> 01:36:57.440\nAbout writing utensil.\n\n01:36:57.440 --> 01:36:59.440\nYou're 83 years old now.\n\n01:36:59.440 --> 01:37:00.440\nDo you still hate Pictionary.\n\n01:37:00.440 --> 01:37:01.440\nYes.\n\n01:37:01.440 --> 01:37:02.440\nOh.\n\n01:37:02.440 --> 01:37:03.440\nOkay.\n\n01:37:03.440 --> 01:37:04.440\nYeah.\n\n01:37:04.440 --> 01:37:08.440\nPictionary because because it's because the time limit.\n\n01:37:08.440 --> 01:37:09.440\nYou know.\n\n01:37:09.440 --> 01:37:12.440\nAnd and people are shouting at you and stuff.\n\n01:37:12.440 --> 01:37:13.440\nI want to.\n\n01:37:13.440 --> 01:37:15.440\nIf I'm going to draw something I want it to be good.\n\n01:37:15.440 --> 01:37:18.440\nAnd on my terms and I don't want somebody to go.\n\n01:37:18.440 --> 01:37:20.440\nTime's up.\n\n01:37:20.440 --> 01:37:22.440\nWhat is that.\n\n01:37:22.440 --> 01:37:26.440\nWell there's a crosshatching because of the shadows here and like that.\n\n01:37:26.440 --> 01:37:27.440\nBut I don't even know.\n\n01:37:27.440 --> 01:37:29.440\nCouldn't you make it simpler.\n\n01:37:29.440 --> 01:37:32.440\nI mean it's it's can you dumb it down.\n\n01:37:32.440 --> 01:37:35.440\nBecause it's it doesn't have to be good.\n\n01:37:35.440 --> 01:37:36.440\nI just need to know what it is.\n\n01:37:36.440 --> 01:37:40.440\nWhy did you take so much time on the stem.\n\n01:37:40.440 --> 01:37:42.440\nJust draw.\n\n01:37:42.440 --> 01:37:43.440\nJust try to happen.\n\n01:37:43.440 --> 01:37:44.440\nI just don't know.\n\n01:37:44.440 --> 01:37:47.440\nIt's just everybody gets all critical of you.\n\n01:37:47.440 --> 01:37:52.440\nWhen I could out fucking draw anybody in this room.\n\n01:37:52.440 --> 01:37:54.440\nCan't those both be true because.\n\n01:37:54.440 --> 01:37:55.440\nNo.\n\n01:37:55.440 --> 01:37:58.440\nI think no one would agree that that's like an amazing Apple you're drawing.\n\n01:37:58.440 --> 01:38:01.440\nBut at the same time in the terms of the constraints of the game.\n\n01:38:01.440 --> 01:38:04.440\nIt probably is conducive to draw like a simpler Apple right.\n\n01:38:04.440 --> 01:38:06.440\nYes that's why I hate Pictionary.\n\n01:38:06.440 --> 01:38:07.440\nRight.\n\n01:38:07.440 --> 01:38:09.440\nBecause it doesn't value what you value about drawing.\n\n01:38:09.440 --> 01:38:10.440\nRight.\n\n01:38:10.440 --> 01:38:11.440\nRight.\n\n01:38:11.440 --> 01:38:12.440\nOK.\n\n01:38:12.440 --> 01:38:17.440\nAnd so there should be a game that I could play that you don't like.\n\n01:38:17.440 --> 01:38:18.440\nAll right.\n\n01:38:18.440 --> 01:38:19.440\nWell.\n\n01:38:19.440 --> 01:38:20.440\nI want to play that.\n\n01:38:20.440 --> 01:38:21.440\nI want to play.\n\n01:38:21.440 --> 01:38:24.440\nI'm going to have to go on an airplane mode to do this.\n\n01:38:24.440 --> 01:38:25.440\nBut I really want to play the.\n\n01:38:25.440 --> 01:38:27.440\nAre you going to turn into an airplane.\n\n01:38:27.440 --> 01:38:28.440\nNo.\n\n01:38:28.440 --> 01:38:29.440\nNo.\n\n01:38:29.440 --> 01:38:30.440\nI wanted to play the Dick and Morty trailer.\n\n01:38:30.440 --> 01:38:31.440\nOh boy.\n\n01:38:31.440 --> 01:38:32.440\nI don't.\n\n01:38:32.440 --> 01:38:33.440\nBut you know what I should have.\n\n01:38:33.440 --> 01:38:35.440\nI heard that his name is Rick in the.\n\n01:38:35.440 --> 01:38:36.440\nWait a minute.\n\n01:38:36.440 --> 01:38:37.440\nNo.\n\n01:38:37.440 --> 01:38:38.440\nIt's just the title.\n\n01:38:38.440 --> 01:38:39.440\nIs it two dudes.\n\n01:38:39.440 --> 01:38:41.440\nNo it's like an alien chick.\n\n01:38:41.440 --> 01:38:42.440\nI don't.\n\n01:38:42.440 --> 01:38:43.440\nThat's already like.\n\n01:38:43.440 --> 01:38:44.440\nWell there's no way to get.\n\n01:38:44.440 --> 01:38:46.440\nWell how would you do a record.\n\n01:38:46.440 --> 01:38:47.440\nTwo gay dudes.\n\n01:38:47.440 -->

in.\n\n01:38:53.440 --> 01:38:55.440\nBut Morty is pretty defined by.\n\n01:38:55.440 --> 01:38:56.440\nOK.\n\n01:38:56.440 --> 01:38:57.440\nIllegality.\n\n01:38:57.440 -->

iPad for porn well yeah\n\n01:40:39.160 --> 01:40:43.880\nI think most people primarily that when I worked at Apple that was like it's not you\n\n01:40:43.880 --> 01:40:48.720\ndon't want to talk about it but most of the time you're looking at no no at Apple it turns\n\n01:40:48.720 --> 01:40:53.000\nout that everyone uses their iPad for like that's one of the main reasons people buy\n\n01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:58.200\niPads for porn viewing yeah to watch porn that's a weird choice because yeah not actually\n\n01:40:58.200 --> 01:41:03.640\nthat much of a but it doesn't stand up

look\n\n01:43:30.720 --> 01:43:44.400\nin the mirror so at one point in there they cut it it goes like yeah Beth he's talking\n\n01:43:44.400 --> 01:43:56.640\nabout his daughter I didn't even need to see the visual no there's no wrong answers I don't\n\n01:43:56.640 --> 01:44:00.880\nknow where I'm torn this is one of those things it's like oh five weeks from now five months\n\n01:44:00.880 --> 01:44:06.360\nfrom now five years from now you gotta go find I made it will I will I look back on these\n\n01:44:06.360 --> 01:44:11.800\ndays when I considered it an innocent honor to express it's like this is what in my this\n\n01:44:11.800 --> 01:44:16.800\nis what I have been working for you in your whole life a community porno a Rick and Morty\n\n01:44:16.800 --> 01:44:23.720\nporno because yeah it's a it is a milestone there is no porno version of the pamphlet\n\n01:44:23.720 --> 01:44:28.280\nyou're handing out door to door there's no porno version of the dishes you wash there's\n\n01:44:28.280 --> 01:44:33.840\nno porno versions there is porno versions of people if you if you if you permeate if\n\n01:44:33.840 --> 01:44:38.960\nyou infiltrate the collective unconscious to a certain degree and no it's not that much\n\n01:44:38.960 --> 01:44:44.360\nit's not a sign of bravery or nobility or goodness it's simply a really clear milestone\n\n01:44:44.360 --> 01:44:49.800\nthat like that like the idea of a porno version of a thing that you created well it's the\n\n01:44:49.800 --> 01:44:55.320\nreason that it's like it's like what we would always talk about with just like what you know\n\n01:44:55.320 --> 01:44:59.840\ncreating icons and things like that is like if somebody could make a Halloween costume\n\n01:44:59.840 --> 01:45:05.120\nof your character you know it's very simple you know you've got like these very simple\n\n01:45:05.120 --> 01:45:12.760\nshapes you know blue hair spiky drool lab coat you're Rick okay and Morty short

needs to be popular to there's also kind of flattery it's\n\n01:45:23.480 --> 01:45:26.880\nlike if you're if you're a kid in high school it just it just means you decided like you\n\n01:45:26.880 --> 01:45:32.320\nwant I want to be the kid that puts on like I'm gonna get these big thick rimmed eyeglasses\n\n01:45:32.320 --> 01:45:37.520\nright and you're at the stein optical and if that exists and you get them and then you're\n\n01:45:37.520 --> 01:45:43.280\nwearing them you're like man a lot of people are giving me shit because now I'm the person\n\n01:45:43.280 --> 01:45:47.120\nthat has like manhole covers on their face I got these big giant glasses but then the\n\n01:45:47.120 --> 01:45:52.520\nday that like you fantasize about if you're fantasizing about popularity or cultural like\n\n01:45:52.520 --> 01:45:58.280\nefficacy is like that that you know you're it's like so and so for class president and\n\n01:45:58.280 --> 01:46:03.440\nthe and the drawing of your logo silhouette thing is like there's this big giant pair\n\n01:46:03.440 --> 01:46:10.320\nof glasses it's like I did it there's some kind of like local boy makes good like I'm\n\n01:46:10.320 --> 01:46:17.320\nin your I'm in your sex now yeah like I did like I was I was watching Mr. Rogers on your\n\n01:46:17.320 --> 01:46:22.480\nTV and then I went out to Los Angeles and I made a thing and I hit the bell and I got\n\n01:46:22.480 --> 01:46:30.080\nthe cookie and it came all the way back around that it's like you're masturbating to it now\n\n01:46:30.080 --> 01:46:36.440\nyeah or it's like yeah it's being it's yeah I guess it's just it's just a like it's cool\n\n01:46:36.440 --> 01:46:43.120\nit's deeply deeply in ground yeah embedded in me but I definitely will like like a couple\n\n01:46:43.120 --> 01:46:48.080\nyears from now I expect to learn that there's some reason that I'm not looking at why that's\n\n01:46:48.080 --> 01:46:53.560\nlike somehow like as I'm recording that going like I'm so stoked about this this is so great\n\n01:46:53.560 --> 01:46:57.200\nhow can this be wrong for anybody isn't this great if you don't like it don't watch it\n\n01:46:57.200 --> 01:47:02.520\nwow it's amazing and I'll be looking at myself saying that oh you dummy you didn't know\n\n01:47:02.520 --> 01:47:08.120\nbut that's good that's good that you're not like oh years from now I'm going to be thinking\n\n01:47:08.120 --> 01:47:13.120\nof the exact same thing I'm thinking now that I mean like that's what I'm saying like hopefully\n\n01:47:13.120 --> 01:47:19.280\nyou're changing like there's a theme to this episode aside from you said it's it's forgive\n\n01:47:19.280 --> 01:47:26.120\nyeah forgive the ignorant so that yeah and and and and be and admit your ignorance yeah\n\n01:47:26.120 --> 01:47:33.040\ndon't get into an argument to win get into a discussion to understand like when you're\n\n01:47:33.040 --> 01:47:40.480\nin these Twitter arguments don't try to bury the other person and and if you if the person\n\n01:47:40.480 --> 01:47:46.400\nstarts making you like realize oh yeah maybe what I was thinking was wrong be the bigger\n\n01:47:46.400 --> 01:47:51.280\nperson and say yeah I guess you're right well I don't know about you but every time the other\n\n01:47:51.280 --> 01:47:56.400\nperson says that I'm always like I'm always like all right got it like with few exceptions\n\n01:47:56.400 --> 01:48:01.680\nwas the person like revved me up so much that I'm like well next time don't fuck around\n\n01:48:01.680 --> 01:48:05.160\nbut mostly when so as soon as somebody goes like you know what I don't know what the fuck\n\n01:48:05.160 --> 01:48:10.440\nI'm talking about like I don't you know it kind of like drains the whole thing but anyway\n\n01:48:10.440 --> 01:48:15.280\nbut I mean I think that I think that's a natural thing because when you get into these arguments\n\n01:48:15.280 --> 01:48:19.120\nyou want to bury the other person finish eyes being right and it doesn't make sense because\n\n01:48:19.120 --> 01:48:24.320\nwe're dumb people and not knowing shit is means that we're about to learn something\n\n01:48:24.320 --> 01:48:28.040\nand we think that that means we're about to have something taken from us and I'm speaking\n\n01:48:28.040 --> 01:48:34.240\nfor myself and saying yeah that that if you're wrong you're dumb and no one wants to be called\n\n01:48:34.240 --> 01:48:39.560\ndumb but but what if you were smart now we just learned that you can be dumb and you\n\n01:48:39.560 --> 01:48:43.520\ncould become in charge of all the nuclear weapons right like so no one's saying being\n\n01:48:43.520 --> 01:48:51.920\ndumb is bad you could not know shit and like run the world in fact you do so now everybody\n\n01:48:51.920 --> 01:48:56.560\nlet's be dumb which means you don't already know what the fuck is going on so now you\n\n01:48:56.560 --> 01:49:01.960\ncan be like sorry I don't understand I sorry about that I don't get it I'm I'm I don't\n\n01:49:01.960 --> 01:49:07.600\nknow anything that I'm talking about you said Steinhoffels before do you guys know I said\n\n01:49:07.600 --> 01:49:13.760\nlens crafters but no you said Steinhoffel well you did not say that you said you said Steinhoffel\n\n01:49:13.760 --> 01:49:19.920\nlet's see if you can admit you're wrong that you okay you never said Steinhoffels tonight\n\n01:49:19.920 --> 01:49:24.680\nI don't I don't think I did I think I said lens crafters did I say Steinhoffel it's on\n\n01:49:24.680 --> 01:49:31.320\nthe or maybe I said okay I find out but anyway that's not my point tweet it Rob my my point\n\n01:49:31.320 --> 01:49:38.520\nis that's what I was gonna ask is that a Milwaukee that I said lens crafters Steinhoffel Steinhoffels\n\n01:49:38.520 --> 01:49:45.280\nand lens crafters were the two places you could buy glasses in Robin and my eyes hometown\n\n01:49:45.280 --> 01:49:52.520\nyeah Steinhoffel I thought I said one he thinks I said the other I guess you know what else\n\n01:49:52.520 --> 01:49:58.880\nwas in our hometown and this is like on my curve at low this is a wonderful world of\n\n01:49:58.880 --> 01:50:06.320\ncamera this is the best song ever and when I'm dead when I die at my funeral even though\n\n01:50:06.320 -->

phone well you teed me up because you sang the song and\n\n01:51:09.560 --> 01:51:12.760\nyou're it's your show I didn't know for those listening I didn't know he was gonna pull\n\n01:51:12.760 --> 01:51:19.880\nthat song out I'm just I'm just saying when I'm dead you know at the funeral which you\n\n01:51:19.880 --> 01:51:28.080\nknow if you can make it make sure that that song plays you know just to send them home\n\n01:51:28.080 --> 01:51:36.640\nthat's what I want I'm gonna okay well I hope Kate's keeping track cuz is it we're recording\n\n01:51:36.640 --> 01:51:42.720\nit too by the way is that in your living will it's not in my living will I mean my ashes\n\n01:51:42.720 --> 01:51:49.520\nare gonna be planted under a tree do you have the tree picked out no are you gonna do one\n\n01:51:49.520 --> 01:51:54.080\nof those life's life's pod things I'm thinking about doing that I'm thinking about because\n\n01:51:54.080 --> 01:51:58.680\nI think that would be better than cuz I saw Neil Neil deGrasse is like said I'm not gonna\n\n01:51:58.680 --> 01:52:02.840\nget cremated because you're just you're taking all your energy and you're dispelleted into\n\n01:52:02.840 --> 01:52:08.600\nthe solar system and they don't need that what we want to do is bury ourselves into\n\n01:52:08.600 --> 01:52:14.560\nthe ground man you know and give it to get energy back be a part of the world yeah but\n\n01:52:14.560 --> 01:52:19.320\nand this is so ill timed but I this is literally coming in over the facts I guess he hit he\n\n01:52:19.320 --> 01:52:25.080\nhits women I'm kidding okay all right all right sorry I thought it was true all right\n\n01:52:25.080 --> 01:52:29.480\nyeah it's a tough time you say that's why I guess that was my quote unquote John was\n\n01:52:29.480 --> 01:52:35.200\nlike I must have missed that headline how would you know like yeah I don't think that's\n\n01:52:35.200 --> 01:52:43.240\ntrue no no it's not true it's not true it was a joke I don't know why you we don't know\n\n01:52:43.240 --> 01:52:47.880\nif it's not the evidence not it's like milkshake duck I don't know he's trying to make a joke\n\n01:52:47.880 --> 01:52:53.200\nmilkshake duck yeah it turns out he's racist who's milkshake duck all right we don't have\n\n01:52:53.200 --> 01:52:59.920\nthis milkshake duck I don't know we didn't do and that's probably for the best what did\n\n01:52:59.920 --> 01:53:06.320\nwe learn yeah you don't want to talk to my wife why why would you like what do you mean\n\n01:53:06.320 --> 01:53:11.640\nwhat I don't know I said hey can I bring Kate along and you said absolutely and an exclamation\n\n01:53:11.640 --> 01:53:17.200\npoint which is rare oh I didn't you I said because it's fine I mean I thought I didn't\n\n01:53:17.200 --> 01:53:20.880\nknow you were taught we I didn't know it's fine it's fine on microphone I don't know\n\n01:53:20.880 --> 01:53:29.120\nwe were talking about women's point of view it would have been great to have I didn't perceive\n\n01:53:29.120 --> 01:53:34.200\nthat as I know we were having that misunderstanding I literally thought you meant because I was\n\n01:53:34.200 --> 01:53:39.320\nlike popping in here to do this thing and then you thought you literally meant can you\n\n01:53:39.320 --> 01:53:45.840\nbring your wife with you as opposed to not being allowed to bring her with you like\n\n01:53:45.840 --> 01:53:51.480\nto come record the thing not can I bring her on the podcast because then when someone had\n\n01:53:51.480 --> 01:53:55.320\nasked should Levy be sitting in this chair the entire time I would have said no let's\n\n01:53:55.320 --> 01:53:59.680\nput Kate in that chair because I made an agreement you swap people out and have people I don't\n\n01:53:59.680 --> 01:54:06.880\nknow I'm not I don't I'm not telling you how to run your show I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm giving\n\n01:54:06.880 --> 01:54:13.240\nlight to the entire misunderstanding and I get it I get it I didn't I figured I I was\n\n01:54:13.240 --> 01:54:18.640\nlike we're either gonna have a woman on here that we're gonna all like a sale with like\n\n01:54:18.640 --> 01:54:25.200\npoints of view and questions or it's gonna be like dudes like talking about like our\n\n01:54:25.200 --> 01:54:31.800\nstake in it and to each other about it
