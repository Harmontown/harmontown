{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:16.000\nIt was 9.29. How's everybody doing tonight? God bless you. Welcome to Harmontown, everybody.\n\n00:16.000 --> 00:20.000\nThank you so much for coming out on a... What night is it tonight? Saturday? Friday? What\n\n00:20.000 --> 00:26.000\nthe fuck is it? Saturday night in Hollywood, California. Please welcome to the stage the\n\n00:26.000 --> 00:46.000\nmayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon. Thank you. Thank you. You're applauding yourselves. You're\n\n00:46.000 --> 00:56.000\napplauding yourselves. It's a special night at Harmontown. Oh, I just realized they were reacting\n\n00:56.000 --> 01:03.000\nto the sash. No, they were reacting to that dynamic intro I just gave you. This is one of many reasons\n\n01:03.000 --> 01:12.000\nwhy it's a special night is because one of our fans made sashes for us. Aren't these smart? It wasn't\n\n01:12.000 --> 01:24.000\na girl, so retract your oz. It was a dude. Prepare your... Dan, Brian. Is that an insight? Is he pretending\n\n01:24.000 --> 01:35.000\nnot to know your name? It's my middle name. Brian? Please do not feel obligated to wear these. I just\n\n01:35.000 --> 01:40.000\ncame across them and couldn't resist. That's actually only funny if you realize that they say\n\n01:40.000 --> 01:52.000\nHarmontown on them as well. I stepped on your joke, Sean Sakame, aka Snap the Jap, one of the most\n\n01:52.000 --> 02:00.000\noffensively named fans that we have. The delightfully racist sash maker. Annemarie Von Furley, could you\n\n02:00.000 --> 02:07.000\nplease come up here as an expert, Sasher and sash Jeff, with his Comptroller sash. Jeff Davis is\n\n02:07.000 --> 02:20.000\nthe Comptroller of Harmontown. Seems like a good time to give him a round of applause. I love it. I never\n\n02:20.000 --> 02:28.000\nfelt more in Comptroller in my life. Don't let everybody know you guys doing good. Sorry, I didn't\n\n02:28.000 --> 02:36.000\nmean to... I'm sorry, I instinctively did this. I was like, don't let someone manipulate you. It's a curious\n\n02:36.000 --> 02:42.000\nthing about Harmontown is I just want to protect the flock and sometimes I'll hurt them by doing it. I went\n\n02:42.000 --> 02:48.000\nto see Jesus Christ Superstar in New York and I was very taken with how whiny and passive aggressive Jesus\n\n02:48.000 --> 02:55.000\nwas. I really like that musical very much for that reason. You mean the actor that played Jesus or the role\n\n02:55.000 --> 03:01.000\nitself? The role itself, I think it's written in a very whiny... Judas is the good role, the juicy role. It's\n\n03:01.000 --> 03:07.000\na manly protagonist role. It's a tragic hero in Jesus Christ Superstar, but the role of Jesus is like...\n\n03:07.000 --> 03:13.000\nHe really is constantly complaining about being Jesus and it's a big bummer for him and no one understands\n\n03:13.000 --> 03:20.000\nand he's just constantly standing up and going, if you guys had to deal with what I had to deal with, forget it.\n\n03:20.000 --> 03:26.000\nYou know what, if I vanished right now, no one would even care. And then the chorus would be like, oh, what do\n\n03:26.000 --> 03:34.000\nyou mean? Well, don't say that. Hey, come on. Hey, buddy. Passive aggressive savior. And you would be. I'm not\n\n03:34.000 --> 03:42.000\ntaking a dig at either the mythical Jesus, the archeological Jesus, or Rice and Schwartzkopf. What were their\n\n03:42.000 --> 03:51.000\nnames? Rice and Schwartzkopf. Jesus Christ Superstar, Andrew Lloyd Webber, and Rice Aroni. I want to know\n\n03:51.000 --> 03:58.000\nabout the archeological Jesus. They found Jesus? The cool thing about him is that he didn't even believe in God.\n\n03:58.000 --> 04:07.000\nHe just packed a six-shooter and that was enough religion for him. You know what a practical man I am?\n\n04:07.000 --> 04:17.000\nIndie reference. We went on the Disneyland Indie ride. Let's not start with the tangents just yet.\n\n04:17.000 --> 04:23.000\nCan we just, can we please center ourselves? Because that was the, okay, we got our sashes. That was reason number\n\n04:23.000 --> 04:34.000\none. It's a special night. Yeah. And I want to be very characteristically self-diagnostic and neurotic and say,\n\n04:34.000 --> 04:39.000\nwhen I say special, I don't mean good. I'm not saying tonight's going to be the best Harmontown, but it's the\n\n04:39.000 --> 04:44.000\nmost special because I've decided, because I'm not going to bother to look because I'm lazy, that this is our\n\n04:44.000 --> 04:52.000\nyear anniversary. It feels like it. Feels good enough. It might have been last week, we had to do two\n\n04:52.000 --> 04:59.000\nHarmontowns this month because my firing is like, it's just, my body is partly loose-changed and some people,\n\n04:59.000 --> 05:09.000\nextra people are gathering it, which is fine. I have no problem with that. There's a fracas. Let's show.\n\n05:09.000 --> 05:16.000\nThose people are already regretting their $10 ticket purchase. There is nothing interesting for me to say. I am\n\n05:16.000 --> 05:27.000\nAce Rothstein in late act two of Casino. Just smoking and like, and another thing, Mr. Governor. I am third act,\n\n05:27.000 --> 05:35.000\nwhat's his name? I don't know what the fuck you're talking about. What's the guy that died of heroin,\n\n05:35.000 --> 05:44.000\nLenny Bruce. I'm third act Lenny Bruce. I think Dan, within the last three shows, you've started off the show by\n\n05:44.000 --> 05:52.000\none time comparing yourself to Michelangelo. I'm pretty sure Einstein and now tonight Lenny Bruce.\n\n05:52.000 --> 05:59.000\nNo, no, no. Thomas Edison is the middle one. I hate it when you get shit wrong. I'm a perfectionist. That's what\n\n05:59.000 --> 06:06.000\nthis show is about. Now, I woke up this morning and I realized I have nothing to do and I thought that tonight\n\n06:06.000 --> 06:10.000\ncould be a special night that we would not know what we were doing as I stepped on the stage. We rarely do.\n\n06:10.000 --> 06:22.000\nI don't come up with desk bits. I don't have articles that are too crazy to be true. I have a few thoughts\n\n06:22.000 --> 06:29.000\nand impulses but tonight is about weightlessness and I don't just mean because I've lost upwards of 14 pounds on the\n\n06:29.000 --> 06:39.000\nfour hour body diet. Wow. You found a way to make it about you. In the middle of a story, all heroes meet\n\n06:39.000 --> 06:45.000\nwith a goddess. They find themselves in a nexus. Give us an example. Give us a couple of film examples.\n\n06:45.000 --> 06:55.000\nReal Genius with Val Kilmer. In the middle of the movie, right in the middle of the story, Val Kilmer has a little\n\n06:55.000 --> 07:02.000\nketchup dab on his lip and he's like listening to the guy that lived in the closet. For the first half of Real Genius\n\n07:02.000 --> 07:09.000\nwith Val Kilmer, they're working on a laser project to get their A from William Atherton, I believe, who states very\n\n07:09.000 --> 07:16.000\nclearly in the first act that he hates popcorn. He couldn't be clearer about his hatred of popcorn. Does that come\n\n07:16.000 --> 07:23.000\nback to vitamin A's? Actually, you know what it does. The weirdest thing is that the movie ends with a giant\n\n07:23.000 --> 07:29.000\npopcorn. Did he turn his house into a big Jiffy Pop? Yeah, he did. They did. It took Genius to do it but they did.\n\n07:29.000 --> 07:36.000\nBut that's not important. He's their teacher and they're working on a laser project. They have to make this laser\n\n07:36.000 --> 07:43.000\nand then in the middle of the movie, they make the laser and then Val Kilmer is eating French fries and he's got a\n\n07:43.000 --> 07:49.000\nlittle dollop of ketchup on his lip and the crazy guy from the basement. You remember? Yeah, I can't think of his name.\n\n07:49.000 --> 07:55.000\nHe lived in the pipes in the basement of the campus. Laszlo. Thank you. And he says to them, yeah, you made your\n\n07:55.000 --> 08:01.000\nlaser. What do you think it's for? What do you think the government's going to use that laser for? And there's a\n\n08:01.000 --> 08:07.000\nshot of Val Kilmer going and he's got like a little ketchup on his lip from eating French fries and the 80's\n\n08:07.000 --> 08:16.000\nneedle drop like swells, you know, some blazer-clad band kind of hits their crescendo as we truck on his face\n\n08:16.000 --> 08:24.000\nand then the second half of Real Genius proceeds because at the nexus, that is the goddess, the hero has\n\n08:24.000 --> 08:28.000\nachieved everything that he could possibly achieve and now he has to figure out what he's going to do with it.\n\n08:28.000 --> 08:34.000\nAm I just going to stand here with ketchup on my lip? We've been doing a year of Harmontown shows. We've\n\n08:34.000 --> 08:39.000\nachieved the freedom to do what we want to go to the moon. And we've got ketchup all over our lips. We haven't\n\n08:39.000 --> 08:44.000\ndone anything. So I want to take tonight to really recalibrate and figure out what we're doing.\n\n08:44.000 --> 08:49.000\nCan we start it off with this kind of, you know, premise that this is going to be about perfecting society, that we\n\n08:49.000 --> 08:55.000\nwere going to find a way to, where we're going to colonize the moon and take the people that come to Harmontown,\n\n08:55.000 --> 09:00.000\nwe're going to figure out society's problems and go and make our own civilization out there.\n\n09:00.000 --> 09:04.000\nBut we had a couple of guests to start off with and we just kind of dropped that. Now we just talk about your\n\n09:04.000 --> 09:09.000\nhemorrhoids and your bubble baths and things like that.\n\n09:09.000 --> 09:17.000\nSo have there been any tweets or anything that, I think grab a drink. Could you read my brother's email?\n\n09:17.000 --> 09:26.000\nYeah, absolutely. I think we get lots of repeat customers here. Who has not been here before by applause?\n\n09:26.000 --> 09:34.000\nMany of you are familiar with Dan's brother, Bones Harmon, right?\n\n09:34.000 --> 09:38.000\nHis name is Doug, but he goes by various nicknames throughout his life.\n\n09:38.000 --> 09:39.000\nBones.\n\n09:39.000 --> 09:46.000\nAt one point he was Dart Vader because he liked darts. And he made his family call him Dart Vader.\n\n09:46.000 --> 09:48.000\nWhat were some other ones?\n\n09:48.000 --> 09:52.000\nMy favorite part in his development, he was like 15 and I was 10.\n\n09:52.000 --> 09:57.000\nHe started hanging out at a pool hall down the block from my mom's place.\n\n09:57.000 --> 09:59.000\nAt 15 years old?\n\n09:59.000 --> 10:03.000\nHe got really into billiards. Well, they had also like a space ace machine and a pango.\n\n10:03.000 --> 10:13.000\nHe decided that he was really into billiards, so he went and got his own billiard cue that you kind of swiveled\n\n10:13.000 --> 10:17.000\ntogether so that he could play people in pool and have his own pool cue.\n\n10:17.000 --> 10:26.000\nAnd he also got a iron-on letter sweatshirt that said pool shark.\n\n10:26.000 --> 10:28.000\nThat was his identity.\n\n10:28.000 --> 10:30.000\nPool shark?\n\n10:30.000 --> 10:34.000\nThe drawing room is like our favorite little local shithole watering hole.\n\n10:34.000 --> 10:38.000\nThey have a dart board there and there's dart champions. They actually have a league there.\n\n10:38.000 --> 10:44.000\nElectronic machines. It's not like a regular horsehair like quality board, but it's one of those electronic machines.\n\n10:44.000 --> 10:47.000\nAnd people come in and they take it very seriously. And I played a guy there.\n\n10:47.000 --> 10:49.000\nI'm not great at darts. I'm okay at darts.\n\n10:49.000 --> 10:54.000\nBut if I see somebody, there was a guy that came in and he had a tank top on and it was not hot.\n\n10:54.000 --> 10:58.000\nIt was wintertime in Los Angeles. It was chilly out.\n\n10:58.000 --> 11:02.000\nIt was cold in the bar. Bars are generally kind of, you know, the air conditioning is on.\n\n11:02.000 --> 11:07.000\nThe tank top was more there just to let you know that on both of the shoulders he had tattoos of darts.\n\n11:07.000 --> 11:10.000\nAnd he was a piece of shit at the dart board.\n\n11:10.000 --> 11:13.000\nAnd I beat him with absolute happiness and arrogance.\n\n11:13.000 --> 11:16.000\nSo I say, yeah, don't fucking put darts in your arm.\n\n11:16.000 --> 11:18.000\nAnd if you do, be the world's greatest dart player.\n\n11:18.000 --> 11:22.000\nAnd if you lose and you have tattoos of darts, be cooler about it.\n\n11:22.000 --> 11:26.000\nWe played for a drink and I beat him twice and he fucked off into the night.\n\n11:26.000 --> 11:28.000\nNever fucking bought me that drink.\n\n11:28.000 --> 11:31.000\nWell, let's have a guest reader come up.\n\n11:31.000 --> 11:39.000\nWho in the first few rows, like, just show your hands if you feel that maybe you were in high school forensics.\n\n11:39.000 --> 11:43.000\nIf you feel like you have an okay handle on kind of cold reading.\n\n11:43.000 --> 11:48.000\nOr maybe you weren't and maybe this is the time to, you know, to try your hand at public speaking, you know.\n\n11:48.000 --> 11:51.000\nJesus, I'm pouring sweat. I'm like a fucking like Harlem Jazz.\n\n11:51.000 --> 11:56.000\nYou know what? The sashes don't breathe, man.\n\n11:56.000 --> 12:03.000\nSnap the jab. Your sashes as constrictive as the untoward racial tension of your name.\n\n12:07.000 --> 12:09.000\nWhat's his real name?\n\n12:09.000 --> 12:10.000\nSean Sakame.\n\n12:10.000 --> 12:11.000\nSean, show yourself.\n\n12:11.000 --> 12:12.000\nIs he even here?\n\n12:12.000 --> 12:14.000\nOh, there he is. Oh, it's Sean.\n\n12:14.000 --> 12:15.000\nAll right.\n\n12:15.000 --> 12:16.000\nYeah.\n\n12:16.000 --> 12:17.000\nThere he is.\n\n12:21.000 --> 12:23.000\nNicely done.\n\n12:23.000 --> 12:27.000\nNext time make sashes for everybody.\n\n12:27.000 --> 12:30.000\nDo we need music? Should I be looking up a song to play for the background?\n\n12:30.000 --> 12:31.000\nCan you play something soft?\n\n12:31.000 --> 12:35.000\nLike some mellow and like, okay, let me find something.\n\n12:35.000 --> 12:42.000\nIs there a male performer here who is capable of cold reads?\n\n12:42.000 --> 12:43.000\nYeah? Okay.\n\n12:43.000 --> 12:44.000\nWhat's your name, sir?\n\n12:44.000 --> 12:45.000\nAdam.\n\n12:45.000 --> 12:46.000\nAdam? All right.\n\n12:46.000 --> 12:52.000\nHold up one second. I have to find a song. You guys get to know each other. I'm going to find a song.\n\n12:52.000 --> 12:53.000\nOkay.\n\n12:53.000 --> 12:54.000\nOh, really?\n\n12:54.000 --> 12:55.000\nYeah.\n\n12:55.000 --> 12:57.000\nOh, Puberty is hitting you quickly.\n\n12:57.000 --> 12:59.000\nYeah, I'm waiting for Puberty.\n\n12:59.000 --> 13:00.000\nOh, okay.\n\n13:00.000 --> 13:05.000\nHe was one of Chang's bodyguards in the place I used to work.\n\n13:08.000 --> 13:09.000\nShow it.\n\n13:12.000 --> 13:14.000\nI think I got the song.\n\n13:14.000 --> 13:17.000\nI don't know what email this is, but I...\n\n13:17.000 --> 13:18.000\nIt should be very ambient.\n\n13:18.000 --> 13:19.000\nOkay.\n\n13:19.000 --> 13:22.000\nThis is just an email from my brother. I don't know if this will wash, but...\n\n13:22.000 --> 13:23.000\nAll right. I'll do my best.\n\n13:23.000 --> 13:26.000\nThe subject is You Sucking.\n\n13:28.000 --> 13:29.000\nYou didn't... Okay.\n\n13:29.000 --> 13:30.000\nJune 3rd...\n\n13:30.000 --> 13:32.000\nHold up. Wait, wait, wait.\n\n13:32.000 --> 13:33.000\nWait for the music.\n\n13:33.000 --> 13:35.000\nWait for the music, Jack.\n\n13:36.000 --> 13:37.000\nOh, here we go.\n\n13:41.000 --> 13:47.000\nRegarding You Sucking, June 3rd, 2012, 4.20 a.m.\n\n13:47.000 --> 13:51.000\nI wanted mom and dad to meet their granddaughter, so we've had a couple visits.\n\n13:51.000 --> 13:53.000\nThought I'd let you know.\n\n13:53.000 --> 13:56.000\nOnce an hour, mom mentions how smart you are.\n\n13:56.000 --> 14:02.000\nI'm not exactly sure of the equation, but anyhow, my daughter is smart because you read books when you were her age.\n\n14:02.000 --> 14:06.000\nDoes no one else remember that I read high school-level books when I was in grade school?\n\n14:06.000 --> 14:10.000\nAnyway, she said someone put you in the closet with books.\n\n14:10.000 --> 14:13.000\nI hope it wasn't too scary.\n\n14:13.000 --> 14:17.000\nAnd I'm proud you made it out of the closet.\n\n14:17.000 --> 14:21.000\nThank you for my daughter's brain, and thanks for emailing once in a while.\n\n14:21.000 --> 14:25.000\nYou drooling dick puddle of chimp semen.\n\n14:26.000 --> 14:33.000\nP.S., you know, if you think about it, I'm smarter than you are because I smoked pot and dropped out of high school.\n\n14:33.000 --> 14:36.000\nYou didn't smoke pot and drop out until college.\n\n14:36.000 --> 14:39.000\nWhy can't a brother get any cred around here?\n\n14:39.000 --> 14:44.000\nP.P.S., mom is worried about your liver.\n\n14:44.000 --> 14:50.000\nI think she'd feel better if you smoked more dope and drank less vodka just a heads up, sent from my I-bone.\n\n14:53.000 --> 14:55.000\nIs it Adam or...?\n\n14:55.000 --> 14:56.000\nAdam?\n\n14:56.000 --> 14:57.000\nAdam.\n\n15:01.000 --> 15:03.000\nThat was a good musical selection. What is that?\n\n15:03.000 --> 15:09.000\nLafayonne Rose.\n\n15:09.000 --> 15:16.000\nAlright, so let's just focus and become weightless and take a step back.\n\n15:16.000 --> 15:19.000\nI did do my brother proud today, and I did get wailing high.\n\n15:19.000 --> 15:27.000\nI really did, because I cleaned out my whole house, and I found my old bong from when I was 25.\n\n15:27.000 --> 15:29.000\nAnd I went and I bought some screens.\n\n15:29.000 --> 15:32.000\nHe was placed a bong for 13 years?\n\n15:32.000 --> 15:34.000\nI was really high.\n\n15:37.000 --> 15:39.000\nThat's where it is.\n\n15:39.000 --> 15:46.000\nJeff found a note on a whiteboard in my apartment once, and I was living in this one bedroom apartment in Los Feliz.\n\n15:46.000 --> 15:49.000\nAnd we were both getting high, and that's okay to say, right?\n\n15:49.000 --> 15:51.000\nWe both have prescriptions.\n\n15:51.000 --> 15:52.000\nNot me.\n\n15:52.000 --> 16:01.000\nOkay, well, as a person with a prescription, Jeff is very nauseous and sleep deprived all the time.\n\n16:01.000 --> 16:05.000\nSo you found this whiteboard thing, and it said,\n\n16:05.000 --> 16:10.000\nDear, not high Dan, don't get high so much.\n\n16:10.000 --> 16:12.000\nIt makes you feel like you're going to have a heart attack.\n\n16:12.000 --> 16:15.000\nSigned high Dan.\n\n16:15.000 --> 16:18.000\nIt was right on like a refrigerator board.\n\n16:18.000 --> 16:23.000\nI was wandering around the apartment, and I read that, and I was like, this is forward thinking.\n\n16:23.000 --> 16:25.000\nAnd at the time, Inagata DeVita was playing.\n\n16:25.000 --> 16:26.000\nWe were high.\n\n16:26.000 --> 16:27.000\nI was high.\n\n16:27.000 --> 16:31.000\nI was like walking around like, and Jeff said, what's with this?\n\n16:31.000 --> 16:35.000\nIt was a note, and I was like, and Jeff's like, so what's the deal?\n\n16:35.000 --> 16:36.000\nI'm not going to listen to that guy.\n\n16:36.000 --> 16:38.000\nHe was high.\n\n16:38.000 --> 16:39.000\nIt's a real story.\n\n16:39.000 --> 16:41.000\nIt really happened.\n\n16:41.000 --> 16:44.000\nOther wonderful things happened in that apartment at the time.\n\n16:44.000 --> 16:46.000\nI was living with this girl, Dawn.\n\n16:46.000 --> 16:48.000\nWonderful young lady.\n\n16:48.000 --> 16:54.000\nIt was pretty much a true patriot.\n\n16:54.000 --> 17:05.000\nShe was in the bathroom like brushing her hair, or studying for her LSAT ladies.\n\n17:05.000 --> 17:09.000\nI don't want to create like a stereotype of my story.\n\n17:09.000 --> 17:12.000\nThere may have been a book there too.\n\n17:12.000 --> 17:14.000\nIt just sounded weird.\n\n17:14.000 --> 17:23.000\nThe truth is she was primping in the bathroom, and I was a tiny little apartment, and I saw her in the bathroom,\n\n17:23.000 --> 17:26.000\nand I said, I'm not making this story short at all.\n\n17:26.000 --> 17:29.000\nI said, I'm going to go eat something.\n\n17:29.000 --> 17:33.000\nAs she said, okay, and I brushed her hair, and I walked into the kitchenette,\n\n17:33.000 --> 17:37.000\nand I started doing, as I do, I started singing a little song to myself,\n\n17:37.000 --> 17:42.000\nand it was a falsetto kind of song, because I was grabbing a little plate,\n\n17:42.000 --> 17:44.000\nsort of a big plate, so I started singing.\n\n17:44.000 --> 17:57.000\nWhen you have a little food, you just need a little plate.\n\n17:57.000 --> 17:59.000\nThat's all I was doing.\n\n17:59.000 --> 18:00.000\nIt was like I was a choir boy.\n\n18:00.000 --> 18:02.000\nIt was just sort of like…\n\n18:02.000 --> 18:04.000\nI like the kind of strange Gregorian…\n\n18:04.000 --> 18:05.000\nIt was kind of like…\n\n18:05.000 --> 18:06.000\nI was finding…\n\n18:06.000 --> 18:07.000\nYou diminished fourths.\n\n18:07.000 --> 18:08.000\nWe all do this.\n\n18:08.000 --> 18:13.000\nWe all sing little ditties, and then I kind of get focused on when I was kind of into it.\n\n18:13.000 --> 18:17.000\nAnd the whole time I had a mental map of where I was and where my girlfriend was,\n\n18:17.000 --> 18:22.000\nshe was in the bathroom doing something, and I was just singing this song,\n\n18:22.000 --> 18:24.000\nand my back was to the doorway of the kitchenette.\n\n18:24.000 --> 18:27.000\nAnd as I turned around, I saw her.\n\n18:27.000 --> 18:29.000\nShe had heard me singing with this falsetto voice,\n\n18:29.000 --> 18:30.000\nand she had decided to not…\n\n18:30.000 --> 18:34.000\nShe didn't want to disturb anything, but she wanted to listen to the song.\n\n18:34.000 --> 18:36.000\nShe was like, Jane Goodall.\n\n18:36.000 --> 18:40.000\nSo she was crouched behind the stove.\n\n18:40.000 --> 18:42.000\nDay seven.\n\n18:42.000 --> 18:43.000\nAnd she…\n\n18:43.000 --> 18:45.000\nAnd you behaved as if…\n\n18:45.000 --> 18:48.000\nShe had become so amused that her face was bright red,\n\n18:48.000 --> 18:49.000\nand she was like…\n\n18:49.000 --> 18:50.000\nBecause she was trying not to laugh,\n\n18:50.000 --> 18:52.000\nbecause she was just listening to this stupid song.\n\n18:52.000 --> 18:55.000\nAnd so I turned around, and she had been doing that the whole time.\n\n18:55.000 --> 18:57.000\nAnd when I saw her, I'm holding a plate,\n\n18:57.000 --> 18:58.000\nand I went,\n\n19:00.000 --> 19:01.000\nbut more feminine than that.\n\n19:01.000 --> 19:03.000\nMore like weird,\n\n19:03.000 --> 19:06.000\nlike more Damon Wayans, like senior,\n\n19:06.000 --> 19:08.000\nlike in an 80s movie, right?\n\n19:08.000 --> 19:09.000\nSo I was like,\n\n19:09.000 --> 19:12.000\nand the plate went flying.\n\n19:12.000 --> 19:15.000\nBut it's very difficult to describe this,\n\n19:15.000 --> 19:18.000\nbecause it's like a photon becomes a phetan,\n\n19:18.000 --> 19:21.000\nand a gluon, the bonds with a neon,\n\n19:21.000 --> 19:24.000\nand it all happens at the center of the universe at the same time.\n\n19:24.000 --> 19:25.000\nBecause I went,\n\n19:25.000 --> 19:27.000\nand she had been crouched down,\n\n19:27.000 --> 19:30.000\nand then she was suppressing her laughter.\n\n19:30.000 --> 19:32.000\nSo when I did that, she went…\n\n19:35.000 --> 19:38.000\nAnd so from my perspective,\n\n19:38.000 --> 19:40.000\nI turned around and saw something that scared me,\n\n19:40.000 --> 19:41.000\nand it turned out to be my girlfriend,\n\n19:41.000 --> 19:44.000\nwho was crouched like a hobgoblin, bright red,\n\n19:44.000 --> 19:47.000\nand making like this weird hobgoblin face.\n\n19:47.000 --> 19:51.000\nSo as I recovered from my adrenaline shock,\n\n19:51.000 --> 19:52.000\nI went,\n\n19:52.000 --> 19:54.000\nwhat are you doing?\n\n19:54.000 --> 19:56.000\nAnd she answered in the moment,\n\n19:56.000 --> 19:57.000\nand went,\n\n19:57.000 --> 19:59.000\nI'm peeing!\n\n19:59.000 --> 20:00.000\nBecause I had made her laugh so hard,\n\n20:00.000 --> 20:02.000\nshe was peeing.\n\n20:02.000 --> 20:04.000\nSo then I…\n\n20:04.000 --> 20:06.000\nThis is the part that I swear,\n\n20:06.000 --> 20:08.000\nand I have to swear is true,\n\n20:08.000 --> 20:10.000\nand I have witnesses to the evidence.\n\n20:10.000 --> 20:12.000\nThat made me laugh so hard,\n\n20:12.000 --> 20:14.000\nI shit my pants.\n\n20:14.000 --> 20:16.000\nPeople hear that story,\n\n20:16.000 --> 20:17.000\nthey go,\n\n20:17.000 --> 20:18.000\nwhy aren't you married?\n\n20:18.000 --> 20:20.000\nBecause that's enough for a whole,\n\n20:20.000 --> 20:21.000\njust keep on,\n\n20:21.000 --> 20:22.000\nit doesn't matter.\n\n20:22.000 --> 20:24.000\nBut the epilogue as Dino comes over, right?\n\n20:24.000 --> 20:26.000\nWell, that's the reason I remember it,\n\n20:26.000 --> 20:27.000\noddly, because Dino came over.\n\n20:27.000 --> 20:28.000\nHow do you forget a story like that?\n\n20:28.000 --> 20:30.000\nI don't know, it's just like,\n\n20:30.000 --> 20:31.000\nit all…\n\n20:31.000 --> 20:33.000\nHow often do you shit your pants?\n\n20:33.000 --> 20:35.000\nMore often than I…\n\n20:35.000 --> 20:37.000\nYeah, actually, it happens more often,\n\n20:37.000 --> 20:38.000\nprobably than…\n\n20:38.000 --> 20:41.000\nSo, you have forgettable pants pooping stories?\n\n20:41.000 --> 20:42.000\nYeah, I do.\n\n20:42.000 --> 20:44.000\nI mean, I could tell you the ones I remember,\n\n20:44.000 --> 20:46.000\nbut I also feel there's probably\n\n20:46.000 --> 20:47.000\na bunch where I'm like,\n\n20:47.000 --> 20:49.000\nah, fuck, I shit my pants.\n\n20:51.000 --> 20:53.000\nIt doesn't happen to you?\n\n20:56.000 --> 20:58.000\nIt'll happen at the weirdest times,\n\n20:58.000 --> 20:59.000\nlike I'll just…\n\n20:59.000 --> 21:00.000\nIt's always…\n\n21:00.000 --> 21:01.000\nThe story is always after…\n\n21:01.000 --> 21:02.000\nWell, before you're…\n\n21:02.000 --> 21:03.000\nYou know, before eight,\n\n21:03.000 --> 21:04.000\nit just happens because it happens.\n\n21:04.000 --> 21:06.000\nAnd we really have to give children a…\n\n21:06.000 --> 21:07.000\nMark, make a note of this.\n\n21:07.000 --> 21:09.000\nWe have to give children a break on this.\n\n21:09.000 --> 21:11.000\nThey're not choosing to shit their pants.\n\n21:11.000 --> 21:12.000\nThey have little muscles.\n\n21:12.000 --> 21:14.000\nI didn't poop my pants a lot.\n\n21:14.000 --> 21:17.000\nBut after eight, from eight to thirty-nine,\n\n21:17.000 --> 21:19.000\nit's always just you think it's a fart.\n\n21:19.000 --> 21:20.000\nThat's it.\n\n21:20.000 --> 21:21.000\nIt's every story.\n\n21:21.000 --> 21:22.000\nI just think it's a fart.\n\n21:22.000 --> 21:23.000\nIt feels the same as a fart.\n\n21:23.000 --> 21:24.000\nAnd I just got like,\n\n21:24.000 --> 21:26.000\nwell, this is going to be great, man.\n\n21:28.000 --> 21:29.000\nThe worst one was…\n\n21:29.000 --> 21:30.000\nYou gambled and lost.\n\n21:30.000 --> 21:31.000\nYeah.\n\n21:31.000 --> 21:33.000\nWell, I mean, it never seems like a gamble.\n\n21:33.000 --> 21:37.000\nThere's no double zero on the roulette wheel, you know?\n\n21:37.000 --> 21:38.000\nThere's no purpose.\n\n21:38.000 --> 21:39.000\nI was like,\n\n21:39.000 --> 21:40.000\nwell, why would I shit my pants?\n\n21:40.000 --> 21:41.000\nI'm not sick.\n\n21:41.000 --> 21:46.000\nI didn't eat a fucking truck full of wheat.\n\n21:46.000 --> 21:49.000\nWell, whatever makes you shit, I don't know.\n\n21:49.000 --> 21:51.000\nI don't know.\n\n21:51.000 --> 21:52.000\nThe opposite of cheese.\n\n21:52.000 --> 21:53.000\nI kept thinking,\n\n21:53.000 --> 21:55.000\nwhat's the opposite of cheese?\n\n21:55.000 --> 21:56.000\nOh, my God.\n\n21:56.000 --> 21:57.000\nI did shit my pants.\n\n21:57.000 --> 21:58.000\nWhy?\n\n21:58.000 --> 22:00.000\nI just ate a truck full of wheat.\n\n22:00.000 --> 22:03.000\nI work on a farm and I just take it in.\n\n22:03.000 --> 22:05.000\nI'm the guy on the harvesting truck.\n\n22:05.000 --> 22:06.000\nI was so high,\n\n22:06.000 --> 22:07.000\nand it's energy full of wheat.\n\n22:07.000 --> 22:10.000\nJeepers Creepers was chasing me from me.\n\n22:10.000 --> 22:12.000\nAnd I ran through a field.\n\n22:12.000 --> 22:16.000\nI guess it was just sort of a residual wheat accumulation.\n\n22:16.000 --> 22:20.000\nNext thing you know, I'm a chronic diuretic wheat.\n\n22:20.000 --> 22:22.000\nStay away from it.\n\n22:22.000 --> 22:24.000\nDino comes up.\n\n22:24.000 --> 22:25.000\nDino came to the apartment\n\n22:25.000 --> 22:27.000\nand he saw two soaked pair of pajamas\n\n22:27.000 --> 22:30.000\nthat we had kind of like hand-washed and hung over.\n\n22:30.000 --> 22:32.000\nThere's a woman's pajamas and a man's pajamas.\n\n22:32.000 --> 22:34.000\nHe's like, what happened there?\n\n22:34.000 --> 22:37.000\nAnd I was like, oh, yeah.\n\n22:37.000 --> 22:41.000\nThe weirdest, the opening of a Paul Thomas Anderson movie happened.\n\n22:41.000 --> 22:43.000\nIt was what happened.\n\n22:43.000 --> 22:46.000\nSomething that requires diagrams happened.\n\n22:46.000 --> 22:48.000\nPretty crazy.\n\n22:48.000 --> 22:49.000\nAlso, there was a time,\n\n22:49.000 --> 22:50.000\nI was in the same apartment,\n\n22:50.000 --> 22:51.000\na different girlfriend.\n\n22:51.000 --> 22:54.000\nRobin was there and we were sitting watching TV\n\n22:54.000 --> 22:56.000\nin the little front room.\n\n22:56.000 --> 22:58.000\nIf you want to see this apartment,\n\n22:58.000 --> 22:59.000\ngo watch Channel 101,\n\n22:59.000 --> 23:01.000\nanything like Laser Fired Computer Man.\n\n23:01.000 --> 23:04.000\nIt all takes place with the orange sofa and the white walls.\n\n23:04.000 --> 23:06.000\nThat's the place.\n\n23:06.000 --> 23:09.000\nAnd we're sitting there and Robin gets up and says,\n\n23:09.000 --> 23:11.000\nDan, hey, a poopoo bear,\n\n23:11.000 --> 23:13.000\nI'm going to go into the kitchen and see if you make me a snack.\n\n23:13.000 --> 23:15.000\nYou want a snacky poopoo bear?\n\n23:15.000 --> 23:18.000\nThey're like, maybe I can get a snack.\n\n23:18.000 --> 23:20.000\nI'm kind of hungry.\n\n23:20.000 --> 23:22.000\nAnd I was like, ugh.\n\n23:22.000 --> 23:24.000\nSo I'm sitting there watching this go on.\n\n23:24.000 --> 23:27.000\nAnd she runs out to make him some cottage cheese.\n\n23:27.000 --> 23:28.000\nNot make him.\n\n23:28.000 --> 23:30.000\nShe doesn't make cottage cheese.\n\n23:30.000 --> 23:32.000\nThey didn't live in a cottage.\n\n23:32.000 --> 23:35.000\nAnd she comes back with a little plate,\n\n23:35.000 --> 23:38.000\na big dollop of cottage cheese\n\n23:38.000 --> 23:40.000\nand he's beautifully fanned out,\n\n23:40.000 --> 23:41.000\ncanned peaches,\n\n23:41.000 --> 23:43.000\ngorgeously arranged in a little array\n\n23:43.000 --> 23:45.000\naround the top of the thing.\n\n23:45.000 --> 23:47.000\nAnd she brings it in the room and Dan goes,\n\n23:47.000 --> 23:49.000\nI kind of rolls his eyes and grits his tears.\n\n23:49.000 --> 23:51.000\nHe's like, what the fuck?\n\n23:51.000 --> 23:53.000\nI fucking hate that face.\n\n23:53.000 --> 23:55.000\nBut you make that stupid poopoo face.\n\n23:57.000 --> 23:59.000\nAnd I was like, I'm just sitting there,\n\n23:59.000 --> 24:00.000\ndigging it.\n\n24:00.000 --> 24:02.000\nI'm getting good all for this one.\n\n24:02.000 --> 24:04.000\nAnd Dan goes, ugh.\n\n24:04.000 --> 24:06.000\nI know you're a good girlfriend\n\n24:06.000 --> 24:08.000\nfor making me the cottage cheese\n\n24:08.000 --> 24:10.000\nand going the extra mile\n\n24:10.000 --> 24:12.000\nof putting the peaches on top.\n\n24:12.000 --> 24:14.000\nI know that makes you a good girlfriend\n\n24:14.000 --> 24:16.000\nbecause you're trying to make it extra special\n\n24:16.000 --> 24:17.000\nand beautiful for me.\n\n24:17.000 --> 24:19.000\nAnd I love that about you,\n\n24:19.000 --> 24:21.000\nbut we've had this conversation like four times.\n\n24:21.000 --> 24:23.000\nI don't like the peaches on the cottage cheese\n\n24:23.000 --> 24:25.000\nbecause the juice from the peaches\n\n24:25.000 --> 24:27.000\ngoes in to the cottage cheese\n\n24:27.000 --> 24:29.000\nand makes it runny and watery and it's gross.\n\n24:29.000 --> 24:31.000\nAnd I know that you're a good person\n\n24:31.000 --> 24:32.000\nfor

Dan for a long time,\n\n37:47.000 --> 37:49.000\nDan's a very intellectual guy,\n\n37:49.000 --> 37:51.000\nvery emotional,\n\n37:51.000 --> 37:53.000\ninternally,\n\n37:53.000 --> 37:55.000\nit's very rewarding\n\n37:55.000 --> 37:57.000\nto be a friend of Dan's.\n\n37:57.000 --> 37:59.000\nAnd also I think that if you're fans of the things he's made,\n\n37:59.000 --> 38:01.000\ntake five, Dan, I'm talking about you.\n\n38:01.000 --> 38:03.000\nIf you're fans of things that Dan's made,\n\n38:03.000 --> 38:05.000\nyou sense that Dan is in them.\n\n38:05.000 --> 38:07.000\nWhen you watch

people.\n\n38:13.000 --> 38:15.000\nAnd I think that coming here and sitting here,\n\n38:15.000 --> 38:17.000\nideally people would sit here and watch you\n\n38:17.000 --> 38:19.000\nget up there

42:39.000\nI think there's some circuits.\n\n42:39.000 --> 42:41.000\nMaybe loose wobbly.\n\n42:41.000 --> 42:43.000\nMaybe burnt out in my head.\n\n42:43.000 --> 42:45.000\nI'm always trying to figure out if it's genetic\n\n42:45.000 --> 42:47.000\nor if it's nature or nurture.\n\n42:47.000 --> 42:49.000\nBut I know that my parents\n\n42:49.000 --> 42:51.000\nand my distant

43:19.000\nYour mom and your brother had some sort of\n\n43:19.000 --> 43:21.000\nweird silent seduction thing going on.\n\n43:21.000 --> 43:23.000\nYeah, I think they always felt like they were kind

43:31.000\nlike, what if we could?\n\n43:31.000 --> 43:33.000\nThey always felt like they were still...\n\n43:33.000 --> 43:35.000\nThey felt like they were against all odds.\n\n43:35.000 --> 43:37.000\nThey were the Sam and Diane.\n\n43:37.000 --> 43:39.000\nThey were one family scuba trip\n\n43:39.000 --> 43:41.000\nand a shark attack\n\n43:41.000 --> 43:43.000\nfrom fulfilling their dreams.\n\n43:43.000 --> 43:45.000\nMaybe in some post-apocalyptic\n\n43:45.000 --> 43:47.000\nscenario, it would be\n\n43:47.000 --> 43:49.000\nnecessary for them to\n\n43:49.000 --> 43:51.000\nhave to\n\n43:51.000 --> 43:53.000\nprocreate the species.\n\n43:53.000 --> 43:55.000\nThey seemed game for it.\n\n43:55.000 --> 43:57.000\nThey were always hitting\n\n43:57.000 --> 43:59.000\nand caressing them.\n\n43:59.000 --> 44:01.000\nFor instance, like, I don't know, like...\n\n44:01.000 --> 44:03.000\nWhat?\n\n44:03.000 --> 44:05.000\nOh, God, thank you, Erin.\n\n44:05.000 -->

And I had nothing in my mind.\n\n52:39.000 --> 52:41.000\nI had no plan of attack.\n\n52:41.000 --> 52:43.000\nI just kicked him square in the balls.\n\n52:45.000 --> 52:47.000\nAnd you've probably seen some movie\n\n52:47.000 --> 52:49.000\nor something where that was funny.\n\n52:49.000 --> 52:51.000\nI just felt like he was...\n\n52:51.000 --> 52:53.000\nWhen...\n\n52:53.000 --> 52:55.000\nYou expected it to make a boing noise.\n\n52:55.000 --> 52:57.000\nNo, like when Han Solo\n\n52:57.000 --> 52:59.000\nwas sitting and having dinner with Landon Calrissian\n\n52:59.000 --> 53:01.000\nand Darth Vader or something, he just starts shooting.\n\n53:01.000 --> 53:03.000\nHe doesn't say anything. He goes,\n\n53:03.000 --> 53:05.000\nhe blocks it.\n\n53:05.000 --> 53:07.000\nBut when you see an enemy, you just attack.\n\n53:07.000 --> 53:09.000\nAnd I just ran. I went, bang!\n\n53:09.000 --> 53:11.000\nAnd hit him.\n\n53:11.000 --> 53:13.000\nAnd if you don't have balls,\n\n53:13.000 --> 53:15.000\na four-year-old's penny lovers can do the job.\n\n53:15.000 --> 53:17.000\nAbsolutely.\n\n53:17.000 --> 53:19.000\nAnd all I remember was I hit him.\n\n53:19.000 --> 53:21.000\nOh!\n\n53:21.000 --> 53:23.000\nThere are about 15 people in attendance.\n\n53:23.000 --> 53:25.000\nAnd no one saw that coming.\n\n53:25.000 --> 53:27.000\nAt least of who are Marty.\n\n53:27.000 --> 53:29.000\nAnd the whole...\n\n53:29.000 --> 53:31.000\nOh!\n\n53:31.000 --> 53:33.000\nAnd Marty tipped over like a fucking...\n\n53:33.000 --> 53:35.000\nJust like a chingar.\n\n53:35.000 --> 53:37.000\nWent right over.\n\n53:37.000 --> 53:39.000\nAnd I hung a hard right and ran out the front door\n\n53:39.000 --> 53:41.000\nand climbed a tree.\n\n53:41.000 --> 53:43.000\nAnd there's...\n\n53:43.000 --> 53:45.000\nI hit the awesome tree out of the front.\n\n53:45.000 --> 53:47.000\nI'm like, fuck this guy. I'm a climber tree. Be a kid.\n\n53:47.000 --> 53:49.000\nFuck you. Fuck you.\n\n53:49.000 --> 53:51.000\nWhen a cat runs into a wall, it just starts licking itself.\n\n53:51.000 --> 53:53.000\nYeah, you caught me in the middle\n\n53:53.000 --> 53:55.000\nof my run into a wall, then licked myself\n\n53:55.000 --> 53:57.000\nfor regiment.\n\n53:57.000 --> 53:59.000\nSo I bone out. I get out. I'm out front.\n\n53:59.000 --> 54:01.000\nI'm climbing a tree. And I hear a combination\n\n54:01.000 --> 54:03.000\nof laughter, horror, moaning.\n\n54:03.000 --> 54:05.000\nMarty's...\n\n54:05.000 --> 54:07.000\nMarty's having a medical emergency.\n\n54:07.000 --> 54:09.000\nEverybody's laughing.\n\n54:09.000 --> 54:11.000\nSome people are like...\n\n54:11.000 --> 54:13.000\nIt was chaos inside the house.\n\n54:13.000 --> 54:15.000\nI could hear it. So I'm climbing a tree.\n\n54:15.000 --> 54:17.000\nI'm up there in a tree. I remember this so vividly.\n\n54:17.000 --> 54:19.000\nI was about to be four years old.\n\n54:19.000 --> 54:21.000\nBeautiful day. Something California.\n\n54:21.000 --> 54:23.000\nI was like, this is the stuff.\n\n54:23.000 --> 54:25.000\nI just took down that motherfucker.\n\n54:25.000 --> 54:27.000\nClimb on my tree.\n\n54:27.000 --> 54:29.000\nI think the instinct was to go be king of the castle.\n\n54:29.000 --> 54:31.000\nLike, get high.\n\n54:31.000 --> 54:33.000\nLike, you know, separate yourself.\n\n54:33.000 --> 54:35.000\nGo back to heaven.\n\n54:35.000 --> 54:37.000\nWhere gods live. Where titans dwell.\n\n54:37.000 --> 54:39.000\nAnd then I fell out the tree.\n\n54:39.000 --> 54:41.000\nBecause I was wearing penny loafers.\n\n54:41.000 --> 54:43.000\nAnd you don't gain a lot of purchase\n\n54:43.000 --> 54:45.000\nwith the fucking footing on a tree\n\n54:45.000 --> 54:47.000\nwith the penny loaf around.\n\n54:47.000 --> 54:49.000\nAnd I fell straight backwards.\n\n54:49.000 --> 54:51.000\nThat got my foot caught\n\n54:51.000 --> 54:53.000\nin a crunch of a limb.\n\n54:53.000 --> 54:55.000\nMy foot got fricking caught me.\n\n54:55.000 --> 54:57.000\nI would have broken my neck and probably died.\n\n54:57.000 --> 54:59.000\nOh, the kids are pretty supple.\n\n54:59.000 --> 55:01.000\nBut I fell to my death and got caught.\n\n55:01.000 --> 55:03.000\nAnd now I'm hanging upside down by one foot.\n\n55:03.000 --> 55:05.000\nAnd at four years old,\n\n55:05.000 --> 55:07.000\nI don't have the core strength.\n\n55:09.000 --> 55:11.000\nYou'll get that later at 25.\n\n55:11.000 --> 55:13.000\nYou'll be like...\n\n55:13.000 --> 55:15.000\nWhen I learned to stop kicking people in the balls.\n\n55:15.000 --> 55:17.000\nSo I'm trying to...\n\n55:17.000 --> 55:19.000\nAt some point, now I'm out of steam.\n\n55:19.000 --> 55:21.000\nBecause dinner was about to happen.\n\n55:21.000 --> 55:23.000\nAnd I decided to kick a dude in the balls.\n\n55:23.000 --> 55:25.000\nTo climb a tree. And now I'm alone.\n\n55:25.000 --> 55:27.000\nAnd what I can't do\n\n55:27.000 --> 55:29.000\nis appeal for help.\n\n55:29.000 --> 55:31.000\nSo I was out there with the blood rushing in my head\n\n55:31.000 --> 55:33.000\nfor what I think was an hour.\n\n55:33.000 --> 55:35.000\nAnd finally people got worried about me\n\n55:35.000 --> 55:37.000\nand it came out. And then there was more laughter.\n\n55:37.000 --> 55:39.000\nAnd I...\n\n55:39.000 --> 55:41.000\nGuess who came and got me?\n\n55:41.000 --> 55:43.000\nYeah.\n\n55:43.000 --> 55:45.000\nUncle Sam.\n\n55:45.000 --> 55:47.000\nYeah.\n\n55:47.000 --> 55:49.000\nThat was the worst.\n\n55:49.000 --> 55:51.000\nWe had a tweet\n\n55:51.000 --> 55:53.000\nthat came in 21 minutes ago\n\n55:53.000 --> 55:55.000\nat Harmontown.\n\n55:55.000 --> 55:57.000\nIt said, finish your Indiana Jones tangent.\n\n55:57.000 --> 55:59.000\nOh, your picture.\n\n55:59.000 --> 56:01.000\nYou're going to make an Indiana Jones movie.\n\n56:01.000 --> 56:03.000\nWait, was that what it is?\n\n56:03.000 --> 56:05.000\nOh, the right.\n\n56:05.000 --> 56:07.000\nWe went on the right. We went to Disneyland.\n\n56:07.000 --> 56:09.000\nIt was fun.\n\n56:11.000 --> 56:13.000\nHappy...\n\n56:13.000 --> 56:15.000\nSlater?\n\n56:15.000 --> 56:17.000\nSlater?\n\n56:17.000 --> 56:19.000\nIs that a reference to my show?\n\n56:19.000 --> 56:21.000\nI don't like the right that much.\n\n56:21.000 --> 56:23.000\nI remember when it came out.\n\n56:23.000 --> 56:25.000\nI was very excited about it.\n\n56:25.000 --> 56:27.000\nBut it's not the best.\n\n56:27.000 --> 56:29.000\nDisneyland has a weird hypnotic thing going where\n\n56:29.000 --> 56:31.000\nyou're so satisfied with so little.\n\n56:31.000 --> 56:33.000\nBut they also, though,\n\n56:33.000 --> 56:35.000\nthey do so many things so right.\n\n56:35.000 --> 56:37.000\nI can't figure it out.\n\n56:37.000 --> 56:39.000\nWe went to Magic Mountain together.\n\n56:39.000 --> 56:41.000\nAnd that's all just about thrills, chills, and spills.\n\n56:41.000 --> 56:43.000\nAnd I haven't been paid to tell you that.\n\n56:43.000 --> 56:45.000\nBut that's just walking around a park\n\n56:45.000 --> 56:47.000\nlike you're going from one roller coaster to another.\n\n56:47.000 --> 56:49.000\nThe most terrifying one of all,\n\n56:49.000 --> 56:51.000\nthe X2 or whatever,\n\n56:51.000 --> 56:53.000\nbecause they won't fucking tell you\n\n56:53.000 --> 56:55.000\nwhat it is.\n\n56:55.000 --> 56:57.000\nEverything is like, oh, it's the Coco Puffs ride.\n\n56:57.000 --> 56:59.000\nYou're crazy for Coco Puffs.\n\n56:59.000 --> 57:01.000\nYou have to help me find more\n\n57:01.000 --> 57:03.000\nCoco on this ride.\n\n57:03.000 --> 57:05.000\nIt's the best ride.\n\n57:05.000 --> 57:07.000\nIt's stupid.\n\n57:07.000 --> 57:09.000\nBut the X2 thing, the whole ride,\n\n57:09.000 --> 57:11.000\nthey keep going, are you ready for this?\n\n57:11.000 --> 57:13.000\nDo you know what you're doing?\n\n57:13.000 --> 57:15.000\nHave you said goodbye to your loved ones?\n\n57:15.000 --> 57:17.000\nThey changed it because when it was just X.\n\n57:17.000 --> 57:19.000\nHave you guys been to Magic Mountain and been on X or X2?\n\n57:19.000 --> 57:21.000\nFucking good.\n\n57:21.000 --> 57:23.000\nIf you like scary rides.\n\n57:23.000 --> 57:25.000\nBut the original, I'm certain of this.\n\n57:25.000 --> 57:27.000\nI went on it like three times.\n\n57:27.000 --> 57:29.000\nKeep your hands and arms inside of the train\n\n57:29.000 --> 57:31.000\nat all times, like that little spiel you get.\n\n57:31.000 --> 57:33.000\nThe X1 was like, everybody,\n\n57:33.000 --> 57:35.000\nyou're about to be on X.\n\n57:35.000 --> 57:37.000\nX is a thrilling experience.\n\n57:37.000 --> 57:39.000\nYou leave your keys with somebody\n\n57:39.000 --> 57:41.000\nyou trust because you're about to go on X.\n\n57:41.000 --> 57:43.000\nIt's really crazy.\n\n57:43.000 --> 57:45.000\nDrink some orange juice.\n\n57:45.000 --> 57:47.000\nYour jaw may wiggle a little bit.\n\n57:47.000 --> 57:49.000\nThey were really preparing you for it.\n\n57:49.000 --> 57:51.000\nYou expect unsolicited back rubs\n\n57:51.000 --> 57:53.000\nand expressions\n\n57:53.000 --> 57:55.000\nof intent to call one another more often.\n\n57:59.000 --> 58:01.000\nMillennials will call it E.\n\n58:03.000 --> 58:05.000\nI was told by some guy that came in\n\n58:05.000 --> 58:07.000\nat a pitch meeting\n\n58:07.000 --> 58:09.000\nhe was telling me about the four stages\n\n58:09.000 --> 58:11.000\nthat generations go through.\n\n58:11.000 --> 58:13.000\nBaby boomers are the blah, blah, blah generation.\n\n58:13.000 --> 58:15.000\nAnd the generation X is this.\n\n58:15.000 --> 58:17.000\nThey always react to the previous generation\n\n58:17.000 --> 58:19.000\nand then the X.\n\n58:19.000 --> 58:21.000\nIt sounded like it was such a bullshit.\n\n58:21.000 --> 58:23.000\nI can't articulate.\n\n58:23.000 --> 58:25.000\nI wanted to throw a rock at the guy's head.\n\n58:25.000 --> 58:27.000\nI was like, what are you saying?\n\n58:27.000 --> 58:29.000\nYou're just saying what your brain wants to be the case.\n\n58:29.000 --> 58:31.000\nThere's nothing entertaining about this tangent.\n\n58:31.000 --> 58:33.000\nIt was so interesting to me\n\n58:33.000 --> 58:35.000\nbecause of course we all think in rhythms of four\n\n58:35.000 --> 58:37.000\nbut we're all projecting like, oh yeah.\n\n58:37.000 --> 58:39.000\nRemember that World War II generation?\n\n58:39.000 --> 58:41.000\nLike they sat around saying that.\n\n58:41.000 --> 58:43.000\nNo, let's be a big generation\n\n58:43.000 --> 58:45.000\nand go fight World War II.\n\n58:45.000 --> 58:47.000\nWe spent the entire days\n\n58:47.000 --> 58:49.000\npeople do at Disneyland\n\n58:49.000 --> 58:51.000\ntalking about all the many people\n\n58:51.000 --> 58:53.000\nwho have died at Disneyland.\n\n58:53.000 --> 58:55.000\nWhich alarms me because I have to figure that\n\n58:55.000 --> 58:57.000\nthat means like a 40 people die at Magic Mountain\n\n58:57.000 --> 58:59.000\nevery week and no one talks about it.\n\n58:59.000 --> 59:01.000\nThere's like 15 things.\n\n59:01.000 --> 59:03.000\nGoogle Disneyland deaths, it's very interesting.\n\n59:03.000 --> 59:05.000\nThe most horrific one\n\n59:05.000 --> 59:07.000\nis the Mark Twain boats coming in.\n\n59:07.000 --> 59:09.000\nI wasn't working that day\n\n59:09.000 --> 59:11.000\nbut I was an employee of Disneyland\n\n59:11.000 --> 59:13.000\nwhen that happened.\n\n59:13.000 --> 59:15.000\nI did a show right in front of that.\n\n59:15.000 --> 59:17.000\nIt could have happened right there.\n\n59:17.000 --> 59:19.000\nI was there with Gorley and you were there too.\n\n59:19.000 --> 59:21.000\nHe was saying, yeah, I worked here\n\n59:21.000 --> 59:23.000\nwhen that smoke mountain\n\n59:23.000 --> 59:25.000\ndecapitation happened\n\n59:25.000 --> 59:27.000\nor something like, what was it?\n\n59:27.000 --> 59:29.000\nThunder Mountain, the railroad.\n\n59:29.000 --> 59:31.000\nAnd then...\n\n59:31.000 --> 59:33.000\nThere's two groups of people\n\n59:33.000 --> 59:35.000\nthat know what I'm talking about\n\n59:35.000 --> 59:37.000\nand they're like, get to your fucking point.\n\n59:37.000 --> 59:39.000\nI'm sorry about that.\n\n59:39.000 --> 59:41.000\nI want to describe the one Disneyland death\n\n59:41.000 --> 59:43.000\nthat is amazing to me.\n\n59:43.000 --> 59:45.000\nYeah.\n\n59:45.000 --> 59:47.000\nIt's the Mark Twain boat coming in.\n\n59:47.000 --> 59:49.000\nIt's so gross.\n\n59:49.000 --> 59:51.000\nAnd when it comes around\n\n59:51.000 --> 59:53.000\nif it's beyond a certain speed\n\n59:53.000 --> 59:55.000\nyou're supposed to let it go all the way around.\n\n59:55.000 --> 59:57.000\nAnd the people on board,\n\n59:57.000 --> 59:59.000\nladies and gentlemen, coming in too fast\n\n59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000\nwouldn't want a horrible thing to happen.\n\n01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000\nSo we're going all the way around.\n\n01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000\nAnd I'm sure everyone's like,\n\n01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000\nfuck you, you fucking dick.\n\n01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000\nI got a fast pass to the fucking\n\n01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000\nGreen Lantern's asshole.\n\n01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000\nHave you ever seen...\n\n01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000\nI got to be there at 1030\n\n01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000\nor I'm going to fucking lose the time of my life.\n\n01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000\nYou're fucking
