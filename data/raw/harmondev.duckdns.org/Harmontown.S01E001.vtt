WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:16.000
It was 9.29. How's everybody doing tonight? God bless you. Welcome to Harmontown, everybody.

00:16.000 --> 00:20.000
Thank you so much for coming out on a... What night is it tonight? Saturday? Friday? What

00:20.000 --> 00:26.000
the fuck is it? Saturday night in Hollywood, California. Please welcome to the stage the

00:26.000 --> 00:46.000
mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon. Thank you. Thank you. You're applauding yourselves. You're

00:46.000 --> 00:56.000
applauding yourselves. It's a special night at Harmontown. Oh, I just realized they were reacting

00:56.000 --> 01:03.000
to the sash. No, they were reacting to that dynamic intro I just gave you. This is one of many reasons

01:03.000 --> 01:12.000
why it's a special night is because one of our fans made sashes for us. Aren't these smart? It wasn't

01:12.000 --> 01:24.000
a girl, so retract your oz. It was a dude. Prepare your... Dan, Brian. Is that an insight? Is he pretending

01:24.000 --> 01:35.000
not to know your name? It's my middle name. Brian? Please do not feel obligated to wear these. I just

01:35.000 --> 01:40.000
came across them and couldn't resist. That's actually only funny if you realize that they say

01:40.000 --> 01:52.000
Harmontown on them as well. I stepped on your joke, Sean Sakame, aka Snap the Jap, one of the most

01:52.000 --> 02:00.000
offensively named fans that we have. The delightfully racist sash maker. Annemarie Von Furley, could you

02:00.000 --> 02:07.000
please come up here as an expert, Sasher and sash Jeff, with his Comptroller sash. Jeff Davis is

02:07.000 --> 02:20.000
the Comptroller of Harmontown. Seems like a good time to give him a round of applause. I love it. I never

02:20.000 --> 02:28.000
felt more in Comptroller in my life. Don't let everybody know you guys doing good. Sorry, I didn't

02:28.000 --> 02:36.000
mean to... I'm sorry, I instinctively did this. I was like, don't let someone manipulate you. It's a curious

02:36.000 --> 02:42.000
thing about Harmontown is I just want to protect the flock and sometimes I'll hurt them by doing it. I went

02:42.000 --> 02:48.000
to see Jesus Christ Superstar in New York and I was very taken with how whiny and passive aggressive Jesus

02:48.000 --> 02:55.000
was. I really like that musical very much for that reason. You mean the actor that played Jesus or the role

02:55.000 --> 03:01.000
itself? The role itself, I think it's written in a very whiny... Judas is the good role, the juicy role. It's

03:01.000 --> 03:07.000
a manly protagonist role. It's a tragic hero in Jesus Christ Superstar, but the role of Jesus is like...

03:07.000 --> 03:13.000
He really is constantly complaining about being Jesus and it's a big bummer for him and no one understands

03:13.000 --> 03:20.000
and he's just constantly standing up and going, if you guys had to deal with what I had to deal with, forget it.

03:20.000 --> 03:26.000
You know what, if I vanished right now, no one would even care. And then the chorus would be like, oh, what do

03:26.000 --> 03:34.000
you mean? Well, don't say that. Hey, come on. Hey, buddy. Passive aggressive savior. And you would be. I'm not

03:34.000 --> 03:42.000
taking a dig at either the mythical Jesus, the archeological Jesus, or Rice and Schwartzkopf. What were their

03:42.000 --> 03:51.000
names? Rice and Schwartzkopf. Jesus Christ Superstar, Andrew Lloyd Webber, and Rice Aroni. I want to know

03:51.000 --> 03:58.000
about the archeological Jesus. They found Jesus? The cool thing about him is that he didn't even believe in God.

03:58.000 --> 04:07.000
He just packed a six-shooter and that was enough religion for him. You know what a practical man I am?

04:07.000 --> 04:17.000
Indie reference. We went on the Disneyland Indie ride. Let's not start with the tangents just yet.

04:17.000 --> 04:23.000
Can we just, can we please center ourselves? Because that was the, okay, we got our sashes. That was reason number

04:23.000 --> 04:34.000
one. It's a special night. Yeah. And I want to be very characteristically self-diagnostic and neurotic and say,

04:34.000 --> 04:39.000
when I say special, I don't mean good. I'm not saying tonight's going to be the best Harmontown, but it's the

04:39.000 --> 04:44.000
most special because I've decided, because I'm not going to bother to look because I'm lazy, that this is our

04:44.000 --> 04:52.000
year anniversary. It feels like it. Feels good enough. It might have been last week, we had to do two

04:52.000 --> 04:59.000
Harmontowns this month because my firing is like, it's just, my body is partly loose-changed and some people,

04:59.000 --> 05:09.000
extra people are gathering it, which is fine. I have no problem with that. There's a fracas. Let's show.

05:09.000 --> 05:16.000
Those people are already regretting their $10 ticket purchase. There is nothing interesting for me to say. I am

05:16.000 --> 05:27.000
Ace Rothstein in late act two of Casino. Just smoking and like, and another thing, Mr. Governor. I am third act,

05:27.000 --> 05:35.000
what's his name? I don't know what the fuck you're talking about. What's the guy that died of heroin,

05:35.000 --> 05:44.000
Lenny Bruce. I'm third act Lenny Bruce. I think Dan, within the last three shows, you've started off the show by

05:44.000 --> 05:52.000
one time comparing yourself to Michelangelo. I'm pretty sure Einstein and now tonight Lenny Bruce.

05:52.000 --> 05:59.000
No, no, no. Thomas Edison is the middle one. I hate it when you get shit wrong. I'm a perfectionist. That's what

05:59.000 --> 06:06.000
this show is about. Now, I woke up this morning and I realized I have nothing to do and I thought that tonight

06:06.000 --> 06:10.000
could be a special night that we would not know what we were doing as I stepped on the stage. We rarely do.

06:10.000 --> 06:22.000
I don't come up with desk bits. I don't have articles that are too crazy to be true. I have a few thoughts

06:22.000 --> 06:29.000
and impulses but tonight is about weightlessness and I don't just mean because I've lost upwards of 14 pounds on the

06:29.000 --> 06:39.000
four hour body diet. Wow. You found a way to make it about you. In the middle of a story, all heroes meet

06:39.000 --> 06:45.000
with a goddess. They find themselves in a nexus. Give us an example. Give us a couple of film examples.

06:45.000 --> 06:55.000
Real Genius with Val Kilmer. In the middle of the movie, right in the middle of the story, Val Kilmer has a little

06:55.000 --> 07:02.000
ketchup dab on his lip and he's like listening to the guy that lived in the closet. For the first half of Real Genius

07:02.000 --> 07:09.000
with Val Kilmer, they're working on a laser project to get their A from William Atherton, I believe, who states very

07:09.000 --> 07:16.000
clearly in the first act that he hates popcorn. He couldn't be clearer about his hatred of popcorn. Does that come

07:16.000 --> 07:23.000
back to vitamin A's? Actually, you know what it does. The weirdest thing is that the movie ends with a giant

07:23.000 --> 07:29.000
popcorn. Did he turn his house into a big Jiffy Pop? Yeah, he did. They did. It took Genius to do it but they did.

07:29.000 --> 07:36.000
But that's not important. He's their teacher and they're working on a laser project. They have to make this laser

07:36.000 --> 07:43.000
and then in the middle of the movie, they make the laser and then Val Kilmer is eating French fries and he's got a

07:43.000 --> 07:49.000
little dollop of ketchup on his lip and the crazy guy from the basement. You remember? Yeah, I can't think of his name.

07:49.000 --> 07:55.000
He lived in the pipes in the basement of the campus. Laszlo. Thank you. And he says to them, yeah, you made your

07:55.000 --> 08:01.000
laser. What do you think it's for? What do you think the government's going to use that laser for? And there's a

08:01.000 --> 08:07.000
shot of Val Kilmer going and he's got like a little ketchup on his lip from eating French fries and the 80's

08:07.000 --> 08:16.000
needle drop like swells, you know, some blazer-clad band kind of hits their crescendo as we truck on his face

08:16.000 --> 08:24.000
and then the second half of Real Genius proceeds because at the nexus, that is the goddess, the hero has

08:24.000 --> 08:28.000
achieved everything that he could possibly achieve and now he has to figure out what he's going to do with it.

08:28.000 --> 08:34.000
Am I just going to stand here with ketchup on my lip? We've been doing a year of Harmontown shows. We've

08:34.000 --> 08:39.000
achieved the freedom to do what we want to go to the moon. And we've got ketchup all over our lips. We haven't

08:39.000 --> 08:44.000
done anything. So I want to take tonight to really recalibrate and figure out what we're doing.

08:44.000 --> 08:49.000
Can we start it off with this kind of, you know, premise that this is going to be about perfecting society, that we

08:49.000 --> 08:55.000
were going to find a way to, where we're going to colonize the moon and take the people that come to Harmontown,

08:55.000 --> 09:00.000
we're going to figure out society's problems and go and make our own civilization out there.

09:00.000 --> 09:04.000
But we had a couple of guests to start off with and we just kind of dropped that. Now we just talk about your

09:04.000 --> 09:09.000
hemorrhoids and your bubble baths and things like that.

09:09.000 --> 09:17.000
So have there been any tweets or anything that, I think grab a drink. Could you read my brother's email?

09:17.000 --> 09:26.000
Yeah, absolutely. I think we get lots of repeat customers here. Who has not been here before by applause?

09:26.000 --> 09:34.000
Many of you are familiar with Dan's brother, Bones Harmon, right?

09:34.000 --> 09:38.000
His name is Doug, but he goes by various nicknames throughout his life.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
Bones.

09:39.000 --> 09:46.000
At one point he was Dart Vader because he liked darts. And he made his family call him Dart Vader.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
What were some other ones?

09:48.000 --> 09:52.000
My favorite part in his development, he was like 15 and I was 10.

09:52.000 --> 09:57.000
He started hanging out at a pool hall down the block from my mom's place.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
At 15 years old?

09:59.000 --> 10:03.000
He got really into billiards. Well, they had also like a space ace machine and a pango.

10:03.000 --> 10:13.000
He decided that he was really into billiards, so he went and got his own billiard cue that you kind of swiveled

10:13.000 --> 10:17.000
together so that he could play people in pool and have his own pool cue.

10:17.000 --> 10:26.000
And he also got a iron-on letter sweatshirt that said pool shark.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
That was his identity.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
Pool shark?

10:30.000 --> 10:34.000
The drawing room is like our favorite little local shithole watering hole.

10:34.000 --> 10:38.000
They have a dart board there and there's dart champions. They actually have a league there.

10:38.000 --> 10:44.000
Electronic machines. It's not like a regular horsehair like quality board, but it's one of those electronic machines.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
And people come in and they take it very seriously. And I played a guy there.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
I'm not great at darts. I'm okay at darts.

10:49.000 --> 10:54.000
But if I see somebody, there was a guy that came in and he had a tank top on and it was not hot.

10:54.000 --> 10:58.000
It was wintertime in Los Angeles. It was chilly out.

10:58.000 --> 11:02.000
It was cold in the bar. Bars are generally kind of, you know, the air conditioning is on.

11:02.000 --> 11:07.000
The tank top was more there just to let you know that on both of the shoulders he had tattoos of darts.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
And he was a piece of shit at the dart board.

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
And I beat him with absolute happiness and arrogance.

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
So I say, yeah, don't fucking put darts in your arm.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
And if you do, be the world's greatest dart player.

11:18.000 --> 11:22.000
And if you lose and you have tattoos of darts, be cooler about it.

11:22.000 --> 11:26.000
We played for a drink and I beat him twice and he fucked off into the night.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
Never fucking bought me that drink.

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
Well, let's have a guest reader come up.

11:31.000 --> 11:39.000
Who in the first few rows, like, just show your hands if you feel that maybe you were in high school forensics.

11:39.000 --> 11:43.000
If you feel like you have an okay handle on kind of cold reading.

11:43.000 --> 11:48.000
Or maybe you weren't and maybe this is the time to, you know, to try your hand at public speaking, you know.

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
Jesus, I'm pouring sweat. I'm like a fucking like Harlem Jazz.

11:51.000 --> 11:56.000
You know what? The sashes don't breathe, man.

11:56.000 --> 12:03.000
Snap the jab. Your sashes as constrictive as the untoward racial tension of your name.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
What's his real name?

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
Sean Sakame.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
Sean, show yourself.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
Is he even here?

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
Oh, there he is. Oh, it's Sean.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
All right.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
Yeah.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
There he is.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
Nicely done.

12:23.000 --> 12:27.000
Next time make sashes for everybody.

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
Do we need music? Should I be looking up a song to play for the background?

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
Can you play something soft?

12:31.000 --> 12:35.000
Like some mellow and like, okay, let me find something.

12:35.000 --> 12:42.000
Is there a male performer here who is capable of cold reads?

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
Yeah? Okay.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
What's your name, sir?

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
Adam.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
Adam? All right.

12:46.000 --> 12:52.000
Hold up one second. I have to find a song. You guys get to know each other. I'm going to find a song.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
Okay.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
Oh, really?

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
Yeah.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
Oh, Puberty is hitting you quickly.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
Yeah, I'm waiting for Puberty.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
Oh, okay.

13:00.000 --> 13:05.000
He was one of Chang's bodyguards in the place I used to work.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
Show it.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
I think I got the song.

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
I don't know what email this is, but I...

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
It should be very ambient.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
Okay.

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
This is just an email from my brother. I don't know if this will wash, but...

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
All right. I'll do my best.

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
The subject is You Sucking.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
You didn't... Okay.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
June 3rd...

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
Hold up. Wait, wait, wait.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
Wait for the music.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
Wait for the music, Jack.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
Oh, here we go.

13:41.000 --> 13:47.000
Regarding You Sucking, June 3rd, 2012, 4.20 a.m.

13:47.000 --> 13:51.000
I wanted mom and dad to meet their granddaughter, so we've had a couple visits.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
Thought I'd let you know.

13:53.000 --> 13:56.000
Once an hour, mom mentions how smart you are.

13:56.000 --> 14:02.000
I'm not exactly sure of the equation, but anyhow, my daughter is smart because you read books when you were her age.

14:02.000 --> 14:06.000
Does no one else remember that I read high school-level books when I was in grade school?

14:06.000 --> 14:10.000
Anyway, she said someone put you in the closet with books.

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000
I hope it wasn't too scary.

14:13.000 --> 14:17.000
And I'm proud you made it out of the closet.

14:17.000 --> 14:21.000
Thank you for my daughter's brain, and thanks for emailing once in a while.

14:21.000 --> 14:25.000
You drooling dick puddle of chimp semen.

14:26.000 --> 14:33.000
P.S., you know, if you think about it, I'm smarter than you are because I smoked pot and dropped out of high school.

14:33.000 --> 14:36.000
You didn't smoke pot and drop out until college.

14:36.000 --> 14:39.000
Why can't a brother get any cred around here?

14:39.000 --> 14:44.000
P.P.S., mom is worried about your liver.

14:44.000 --> 14:50.000
I think she'd feel better if you smoked more dope and drank less vodka just a heads up, sent from my I-bone.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
Is it Adam or...?

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
Adam?

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
Adam.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
That was a good musical selection. What is that?

15:03.000 --> 15:09.000
Lafayonne Rose.

15:09.000 --> 15:16.000
Alright, so let's just focus and become weightless and take a step back.

15:16.000 --> 15:19.000
I did do my brother proud today, and I did get wailing high.

15:19.000 --> 15:27.000
I really did, because I cleaned out my whole house, and I found my old bong from when I was 25.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
And I went and I bought some screens.

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
He was placed a bong for 13 years?

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
I was really high.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
That's where it is.

15:39.000 --> 15:46.000
Jeff found a note on a whiteboard in my apartment once, and I was living in this one bedroom apartment in Los Feliz.

15:46.000 --> 15:49.000
And we were both getting high, and that's okay to say, right?

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
We both have prescriptions.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
Not me.

15:52.000 --> 16:01.000
Okay, well, as a person with a prescription, Jeff is very nauseous and sleep deprived all the time.

16:01.000 --> 16:05.000
So you found this whiteboard thing, and it said,

16:05.000 --> 16:10.000
Dear, not high Dan, don't get high so much.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
It makes you feel like you're going to have a heart attack.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
Signed high Dan.

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
It was right on like a refrigerator board.

16:18.000 --> 16:23.000
I was wandering around the apartment, and I read that, and I was like, this is forward thinking.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
And at the time, Inagata DeVita was playing.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
We were high.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.000
I was high.

16:27.000 --> 16:31.000
I was like walking around like, and Jeff said, what's with this?

16:31.000 --> 16:35.000
It was a note, and I was like, and Jeff's like, so what's the deal?

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
I'm not going to listen to that guy.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
He was high.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
It's a real story.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
It really happened.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
Other wonderful things happened in that apartment at the time.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
I was living with this girl, Dawn.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
Wonderful young lady.

16:48.000 --> 16:54.000
It was pretty much a true patriot.

16:54.000 --> 17:05.000
She was in the bathroom like brushing her hair, or studying for her LSAT ladies.

17:05.000 --> 17:09.000
I don't want to create like a stereotype of my story.

17:09.000 --> 17:12.000
There may have been a book there too.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
It just sounded weird.

17:14.000 --> 17:23.000
The truth is she was primping in the bathroom, and I was a tiny little apartment, and I saw her in the bathroom,

17:23.000 --> 17:26.000
and I said, I'm not making this story short at all.

17:26.000 --> 17:29.000
I said, I'm going to go eat something.

17:29.000 --> 17:33.000
As she said, okay, and I brushed her hair, and I walked into the kitchenette,

17:33.000 --> 17:37.000
and I started doing, as I do, I started singing a little song to myself,

17:37.000 --> 17:42.000
and it was a falsetto kind of song, because I was grabbing a little plate,

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
sort of a big plate, so I started singing.

17:44.000 --> 17:57.000
When you have a little food, you just need a little plate.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
That's all I was doing.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
It was like I was a choir boy.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
It was just sort of like…

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
I like the kind of strange Gregorian…

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
It was kind of like…

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
I was finding…

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
You diminished fourths.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.000
We all do this.

18:08.000 --> 18:13.000
We all sing little ditties, and then I kind of get focused on when I was kind of into it.

18:13.000 --> 18:17.000
And the whole time I had a mental map of where I was and where my girlfriend was,

18:17.000 --> 18:22.000
she was in the bathroom doing something, and I was just singing this song,

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
and my back was to the doorway of the kitchenette.

18:24.000 --> 18:27.000
And as I turned around, I saw her.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
She had heard me singing with this falsetto voice,

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
and she had decided to not…

18:30.000 --> 18:34.000
She didn't want to disturb anything, but she wanted to listen to the song.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
She was like, Jane Goodall.

18:36.000 --> 18:40.000
So she was crouched behind the stove.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
Day seven.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
And she…

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
And you behaved as if…

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
She had become so amused that her face was bright red,

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
and she was like…

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
Because she was trying not to laugh,

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
because she was just listening to this stupid song.

18:52.000 --> 18:55.000
And so I turned around, and she had been doing that the whole time.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
And when I saw her, I'm holding a plate,

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
and I went,

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
but more feminine than that.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
More like weird,

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
like more Damon Wayans, like senior,

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
like in an 80s movie, right?

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
So I was like,

19:09.000 --> 19:12.000
and the plate went flying.

19:12.000 --> 19:15.000
But it's very difficult to describe this,

19:15.000 --> 19:18.000
because it's like a photon becomes a phetan,

19:18.000 --> 19:21.000
and a gluon, the bonds with a neon,

19:21.000 --> 19:24.000
and it all happens at the center of the universe at the same time.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
Because I went,

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
and she had been crouched down,

19:27.000 --> 19:30.000
and then she was suppressing her laughter.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
So when I did that, she went…

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
And so from my perspective,

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
I turned around and saw something that scared me,

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
and it turned out to be my girlfriend,

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
who was crouched like a hobgoblin, bright red,

19:44.000 --> 19:47.000
and making like this weird hobgoblin face.

19:47.000 --> 19:51.000
So as I recovered from my adrenaline shock,

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
I went,

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
what are you doing?

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
And she answered in the moment,

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
and went,

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
I'm peeing!

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
Because I had made her laugh so hard,

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
she was peeing.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
So then I…

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
This is the part that I swear,

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
and I have to swear is true,

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
and I have witnesses to the evidence.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
That made me laugh so hard,

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
I shit my pants.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
People hear that story,

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
they go,

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
why aren't you married?

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
Because that's enough for a whole,

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
just keep on,

20:21.000 --> 20:22.000
it doesn't matter.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
But the epilogue as Dino comes over, right?

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
Well, that's the reason I remember it,

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
oddly, because Dino came over.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
How do you forget a story like that?

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
I don't know, it's just like,

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
it all…

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
How often do you shit your pants?

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
More often than I…

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
Yeah, actually, it happens more often,

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
probably than…

20:38.000 --> 20:41.000
So, you have forgettable pants pooping stories?

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
Yeah, I do.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
I mean, I could tell you the ones I remember,

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
but I also feel there's probably

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
a bunch where I'm like,

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
ah, fuck, I shit my pants.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
It doesn't happen to you?

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
It'll happen at the weirdest times,

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
like I'll just…

20:59.000 --> 21:00.000
It's always…

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
The story is always after…

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
Well, before you're…

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
You know, before eight,

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
it just happens because it happens.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
And we really have to give children a…

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
Mark, make a note of this.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
We have to give children a break on this.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
They're not choosing to shit their pants.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
They have little muscles.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
I didn't poop my pants a lot.

21:14.000 --> 21:17.000
But after eight, from eight to thirty-nine,

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
it's always just you think it's a fart.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
That's it.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
It's every story.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
I just think it's a fart.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
It feels the same as a fart.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
And I just got like,

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
well, this is going to be great, man.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
The worst one was…

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
You gambled and lost.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
Yeah.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
Well, I mean, it never seems like a gamble.

21:33.000 --> 21:37.000
There's no double zero on the roulette wheel, you know?

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
There's no purpose.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
I was like,

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
well, why would I shit my pants?

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
I'm not sick.

21:41.000 --> 21:46.000
I didn't eat a fucking truck full of wheat.

21:46.000 --> 21:49.000
Well, whatever makes you shit, I don't know.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
I don't know.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
The opposite of cheese.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
I kept thinking,

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
what's the opposite of cheese?

21:55.000 --> 21:56.000
Oh, my God.

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
I did shit my pants.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.000
Why?

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
I just ate a truck full of wheat.

22:00.000 --> 22:03.000
I work on a farm and I just take it in.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
I'm the guy on the harvesting truck.

22:05.000 --> 22:06.000
I was so high,

22:06.000 --> 22:07.000
and it's energy full of wheat.

22:07.000 --> 22:10.000
Jeepers Creepers was chasing me from me.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
And I ran through a field.

22:12.000 --> 22:16.000
I guess it was just sort of a residual wheat accumulation.

22:16.000 --> 22:20.000
Next thing you know, I'm a chronic diuretic wheat.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
Stay away from it.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
Dino comes up.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
Dino came to the apartment

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
and he saw two soaked pair of pajamas

22:27.000 --> 22:30.000
that we had kind of like hand-washed and hung over.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
There's a woman's pajamas and a man's pajamas.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
He's like, what happened there?

22:34.000 --> 22:37.000
And I was like, oh, yeah.

22:37.000 --> 22:41.000
The weirdest, the opening of a Paul Thomas Anderson movie happened.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
It was what happened.

22:43.000 --> 22:46.000
Something that requires diagrams happened.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
Pretty crazy.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
Also, there was a time,

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
I was in the same apartment,

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
a different girlfriend.

22:51.000 --> 22:54.000
Robin was there and we were sitting watching TV

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
in the little front room.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
If you want to see this apartment,

22:58.000 --> 22:59.000
go watch Channel 101,

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
anything like Laser Fired Computer Man.

23:01.000 --> 23:04.000
It all takes place with the orange sofa and the white walls.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
That's the place.

23:06.000 --> 23:09.000
And we're sitting there and Robin gets up and says,

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
Dan, hey, a poopoo bear,

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
I'm going to go into the kitchen and see if you make me a snack.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
You want a snacky poopoo bear?

23:15.000 --> 23:18.000
They're like, maybe I can get a snack.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
I'm kind of hungry.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
And I was like, ugh.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
So I'm sitting there watching this go on.

23:24.000 --> 23:27.000
And she runs out to make him some cottage cheese.

23:27.000 --> 23:28.000
Not make him.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
She doesn't make cottage cheese.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
They didn't live in a cottage.

23:32.000 --> 23:35.000
And she comes back with a little plate,

23:35.000 --> 23:38.000
a big dollop of cottage cheese

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
and he's beautifully fanned out,

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
canned peaches,

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
gorgeously arranged in a little array

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
around the top of the thing.

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
And she brings it in the room and Dan goes,

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
I kind of rolls his eyes and grits his tears.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
He's like, what the fuck?

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
I fucking hate that face.

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
But you make that stupid poopoo face.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
And I was like, I'm just sitting there,

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
digging it.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
I'm getting good all for this one.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
And Dan goes, ugh.

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
I know you're a good girlfriend

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
for making me the cottage cheese

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
and going the extra mile

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
of putting the peaches on top.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
I know that makes you a good girlfriend

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
because you're trying to make it extra special

24:16.000 --> 24:17.000
and beautiful for me.

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
And I love that about you,

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
but we've had this conversation like four times.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
I don't like the peaches on the cottage cheese

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
because the juice from the peaches

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
goes in to the cottage cheese

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
and makes it runny and watery and it's gross.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
And I know that you're a good person

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
for doing that,

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
but I just don't understand

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
how many more times we're going to have to have

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
the cottage cheese and peaches

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
conversation.

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
She goes, well, then just say that.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
I hate when you make that poopoo face.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
And Dan goes, that's a stupid thing to hate.

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
Abraham Lincoln hated slavery.

24:47.000 --> 24:59.000
What are you going to talk about in heaven?

24:59.000 --> 25:02.000
And I sang a little diddy that went,

25:02.000 --> 25:05.000
don't date Dan Harmon.

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
Fucking awesome.

25:07.000 --> 25:08.000
With one swoop.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
You took her right in the face.

25:10.000 --> 25:14.000
She went, when wandered off, that's the best.

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
We didn't time this right.

25:16.000 --> 25:17.000
I'll do it.

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
You talk.

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
I'll make you a drink.

25:19.000 --> 25:20.000
Okay, thank you.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.000
Thanks.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
He's a big fan.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
He's Watson to my Sherlock.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
I should say.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
You guys have seen those movies, of course,

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
where Sherlock Holmes is so smart

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
he can beat the shit out of people.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
It's insane.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
Do you realize that, like,

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
there's like super, super duper

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
Dan Harmon Rob Schrab fans

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
and then you're familiar with a thing we did in 1999

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
called Heat Vision and Jack,

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
which was Jack Black.

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
Jack Black was an AstraZis,

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
the smartest guy in the world, blah, blah, blah.

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
We tried to write a movie version of it

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
a long time ago, and that was,

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
it was like, saw Sherlock Holmes,

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
it was like, this is the bit that I was doing.

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
The bit was that he's like,

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
he gets really smart, he's so smart

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
he knows how to beat the shit out of you.

26:11.000 --> 26:14.000
Which is not, that's not, because that's not really smart.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
That's the joke, but their joke

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
is a blockbuster film.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
They made a sequel.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
I want to see it.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
I haven't seen it, are they good?

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
They're not good, but like,

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
People like them? By applause, who likes those movies?

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
Are they good? Three guys.

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
With television and movies, it's like...

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
Oh, and a girl, sorry.

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
You throw enough money at these things,

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
it's like these people are so handsome and charming

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
You love Robert Downey Jr.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
You love Jude Law, is that his name?

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
Yeah.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
That part, that part.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
I mean, this is not funny, but like,

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
that strikes me as a movie that they just wrote a movie

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
and they added the title to it,

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
because you have to add a recognizable franchise

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
to something to make it sellable.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
I don't think that's true, because this movie

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
would have had to have been called

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
Action in the Queen Victoria's Allies.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
You know, it wouldn't have,

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
it wouldn't, there wasn't something that,

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
I believe that with other movies where you go like,

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
this isn't Tremors 3.

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
This is just a regular movie about

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
aliens invading Las Vegas.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
It was called Lucky Seven

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
from Planet Saturn

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
and you added Tremors Aliens.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
Anyways, speaking of Prometheus,

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
did we talk about...

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
And again, I haven't seen it, and Walt,

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
I don't want to see that.

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
If you're going to write a movie,

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
it's a prequel to the Die Hard mythology.

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
And, thank you.

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
He's joking, but your applause will make it

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
actually happen.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
It's called Nakatomi.

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
And it's not, you know,

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
don't go there expecting to see anyone

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
say Yippee-ki-yay, motherfucker.

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
There's no walkie-talkies in it.

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
It's just

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
it's cheersome DNA

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
with Die Hard, I guess.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
This is how Dan pitches things to studios.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
Hey Dan, I'm glad you could come.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
Let's hear about your new project.

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
Yeah, it's an hour and a half of you

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
watching guys discover a puddle of

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
black goo that turns into a skyscraper,

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
a cop, and a terrorist.

28:27.000 --> 28:31.000
Right at the end.

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
My wife's leaving me.

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
Maybe, starting to.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
I think I'll

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
enjoy people shooting

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
glass later.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
That was my Alan Rickman.

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
That was bad.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
That sounded a lot like a toothless

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
retarded Sean Connery.

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
Something happened.

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
Now, can we hear you Sean Connery?

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
Most things down here

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
don't react well to bullets.

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
That's not bad.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
That's not bad.

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
Thank you. How many Sean Connery's

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
have you heard?

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
Come on, give me someone else.

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
I heard Christopher Walken.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
Christopher Walken. I got a

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
Pringle for a fever.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
Don Knotts.

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
Wow, Jack!

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
Ah!

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
Don Knotts's

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
merging into Bill Clinton.

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
Well, Jack, you gotta

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
pay the rent otherwise

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
it's not clear what the inflation

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
is.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
Little George Bushman.

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
Popeye, right at the end.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
Now, finish off with Rosie Perez.

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
I know you do a good Rosie Perez.

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
Go from who to Rosie Perez?

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
Popeye into Rosie.

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
You don't do that to me, okay?

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
Hey, give me, give me,

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
give me some spinach, girl.

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
I'll stab you in the eye, motherfucker, because I'm Spanish.

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
Why are you a writer?

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
Why waste this?

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
Have a show.

30:09.000 --> 30:19.000
Yeah.

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
That's the best.

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
I don't want this to be, I don't want

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
Harmontown to be a sad place.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
I think it should be a free place

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
where we're free to...

30:29.000 --> 30:33.000
She's certainly a Harmontown fan. Also, she was the only girl that clapped for the Sherlock Holmes.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
Uh, I, uh,

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
I am a,

30:37.000 --> 30:41.000
I'm a major addict of the, uh, Tumblr blog about me.

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
Called Having Changed.

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
There's a blog, there's a blog about me.

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
And it's about you two

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
and our relationship.

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
Everything we do together.

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
Every ice cream we get.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
Every kite we fly.

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
Every InstaWeGram.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
Is chronicled on this Tumblr blog.

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
Every breath you make.

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
Every breath you take.

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
And I, and I really, really hope to God

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
that the person that maintains that blog isn't here.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
And it doesn't get back to them.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
Because then they'll, they won't stop right away,

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
but it'll be the death of it.

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
But I can't think of a cooler thing.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
I think every single person in the world should have

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
a Tumblr blog about,

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
like everything.

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
If you just take a picture of yourself brushing your teeth,

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
and then 30 seconds later it's like,

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
it's a Tumblr entry.

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
He's brushing his teeth!

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
And it's just like, so-and-so, I like this.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
There's like a heart with 35 after it.

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
Like, I don't know what I'm going to do

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
when this stops.

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
I may...

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
Well, because you're overly obsessive about reading

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
the comment sections in reviews of your show,

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
or things you do, which I think it's just

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
insanity.

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
To go read the comment section of anything,

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
it's always a bunch of just dicks.

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
Like, the people that

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
write comments are generally not good fans,

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
good reviewers,

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
are people that have some weird acts to grind,

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
and then it devolves into some sort of weird racist

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
conversation.

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
It's called Conversations in a Trailer

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
with Chevy Chays,

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
where I tried to convince myself I wasn't.

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
But that's how...

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
Yeah, anyways.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
My girlfriend

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
got a Facebook message, I think,

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
from a couple girls who tracked her down.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
She used to be a camp counselor for kids and stuff,

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
and they just heard her podcast,

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
and they just wanted to write her a letter

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
and say, we're juniors in college now,

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
and you're very inspiring and charming,

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
and it's great that you're doing this thing

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
because she...

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
That's what it's all about,

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
much like the hanky-panky.

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
No, totally unlike the hanky-panky.

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
The hanky-panky is just about putting left and right things

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
and stuff.

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
What entertainment is all about is...

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
Pokey Pokey.

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
Pokey Pokey.

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
I didn't have a cute up.

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
Boy.

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
There's another topic we can talk about.

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
My brain is disintegrating.

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
You're losing it.

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
Yeah, I'm not on it anymore.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
But I think that if I play enough video games,

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
everything's going to come back,

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
and I've been taking some very promising meetings, Jeff.

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
It's very exciting.

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
I heard your pitch voice. It sounds good.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
Yeah.

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
Yeah, one of them...

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
I got to sell a movie,

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
but it's not going to be a game

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
in a suit.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
We're on a bunch of cardboard skyscrapers.

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
We have the state-of-the-art technology.

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
It's motion capture.

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
It's going to be a real reptilian monster

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
in keeping with

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
the scientific laws of the current

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
census.

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
Who wants to see your Godzilla movie?

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
Are you retarded?

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
You fixed Godzilla.

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
You're a genius.

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
I...

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
Oh, man. God damn it.

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
What were you talking about before,

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
hanky-panky?

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
I can't believe I forgot the hokey-pokey.

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
Podcasts.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
Yeah, but some chicks she knew

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
contacted her and made her feel good.

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
Whatever.

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
That's what it's all about.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
So the story didn't lose team.

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
It just didn't matter to you.

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
You just

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
lost interest.

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
I wanted to ramp into a forced

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
emotional expression

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
of how much I value the fans

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
and to make them go,

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
aww, because I'm not

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
being very funny tonight.

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
We were at a restaurant and Dan

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
discovered that there are

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
Tumblr blogs that are just dedicated

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
to the daily

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
quotidian shit that Dan does around it.

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
Dan's having a sandwich.

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
Like, Dan's going to have a sandwich?

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
And they make a gif.

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
And there's little hearts going above it.

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
They like that Dan ate that sandwich.

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
We're all having a conversation.

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
It was me, you, Aaron, and the thing.

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
Were you there, Dino?

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
And we're sitting there,

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
and Dan just completely went

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
to Neverland.

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
We were just looking at a second.

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
A big smile came across.

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
He goes, sorry guys, this is going to be

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
the next 72 hours of my life.

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
You go through this thing,

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
you're going back through time

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
of every picture that you've ever posted

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
or anyone's ever posted of you.

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
And it's this big love fest, and there's none of the negativity

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
that goes along with being, you know,

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
the bottom of a YouTube...

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
Yeah, they're never like day eight I found out

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
his buttsticks.

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
Oh, his hair everywhere.

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
His hair all over.

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
Well, you don't post those photos, though.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
No. Start doing that shit and find out.

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
All right.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
Thanks for my new diet.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
We should have done

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
meeting with the goddess.

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
We should have been taking pictures of you

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
if we'd known all along

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
and have this timeline

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
of how we both look

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
as the circles under my eyes get bigger.

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
Who could have predicted

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
my dramatic weight loss?

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
I mean, would you look at this guy?

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
It's amazing.

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
You're

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
notably bigger than you are right now.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
Yeah.

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
I know, Dan.

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
Imagine like a Martian came down like,

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
what are these people?

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
Who are they going to see?

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
What's so important about Harmontown?

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
Was I fatter in January?

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
You were wearing turquoise pants.

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
Yeah, but I just went straight to my thighs

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
and everyone's just like,

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
texting.

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
These humans seem to be

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
directionless and weightless.

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
They seem to have met with their goddess.

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
Send them the cancer cure.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
What's the next step?

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
Assuming that you guys know what he's talking about,

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
it's the Joseph Campbell's hero's journey.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
So what is this the step

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
after meeting with the goddess?

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
How can we know, Jeff?

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
We have to figure it out ourselves.

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
Mythologically, it's what?

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
Yes, I would say.

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
Now we have to grapple with,

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
we have to decide tonight

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
what we're going to do from now on.

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
I don't know that.

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
I'm assuming in attendance numbers.

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
But I would say that

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
knowing Dan for a long time,

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
Dan's a very intellectual guy,

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
very emotional,

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
internally,

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
it's very rewarding

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
to be a friend of Dan's.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
And also I think that if you're fans of the things he's made,

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
take five, Dan, I'm talking about you.

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
If you're fans of things that Dan's made,

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
you sense that Dan is in them.

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
When you watch the characters on community,

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
they're all Dan.

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
They're all versions of himself and that thing.

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
Dan gives a lot to people.

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
And I think that coming here and sitting here,

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
ideally people would sit here and watch you

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
get up there wearing your stupid sash

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
and drinking your vodka

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
and talking about your butt,

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
that somehow it manages to be redemptive

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
because there's something very charming

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
and human about somebody getting up there

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
and revealing all those things about themselves.

38:31.000 --> 38:35.000
Right.

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
I think that all that goes without saying.

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
Well, we'll cut it out for the podcast.

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
Alright, Adam.

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
There's another email from my brother

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
that came a week earlier than that one.

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
Just give this one a quick read.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
Do we need music for this?

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
The subject line is again you sucking.

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
Yeah, whatever music was...

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
Well, I've got daybreak pulled up,

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
so we'll just go daybreak.

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
You sucking.

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
4.38 a.m.

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
Is this the same day or is this on...

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
Okay, so it's...

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
Stop, stop, stop.

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
Okay, because the last demo was sent

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
at 4.20 a.m. and this one sent on 4.20.

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
So I think he has like a theme going.

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
Do you want something different, more emotional?

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
Okay, let me...

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
I got you, give me one second.

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
Alright, that was Lovey and Rose,

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
but let's try something else.

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
I don't have any fucking Anya on my...

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
This might be good.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
I like this.

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
Hey, fucker.

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
I think you'd be a millionaire

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
if you wrote for a video game franchise

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
with a likable butt gruff protagonist.

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
B-U-T-T gruff.

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
Investigate.

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
And when you're a millionaire

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
because you follow my advice,

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
email me back, you fuzzy-back shit-knocker.

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
Hey, I see you're dabbling

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
with digital video again.

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
Are you gonna make some more home videos

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
about farts?

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
Okay, okay, let's have a serious brother moment.

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
Yeah.

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
So I was just rubbing my balls

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
and I was thinking, these balls are so big.

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
Smooth.

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
And then I just start to think about your balls

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
rubbing my balls, I imagine.

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
Your balls are tiny and wrinkly,

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
like a lemon that didn't get enough sun.

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
Good times.

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
Good times.

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
I'll emo you again in a few months, you know.

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
Just to prove I'm funnier than you.

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
You know.

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
Because of what with the ball jokes and stuff.

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
It's just like you're here

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
on the toilet with me.

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
This was fun.

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
Did you ever notice you have a small head?

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
I mean, look at Al Roker's head

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
sent from my eye bone.

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
Other hand for Adam.

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
The Bones

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
Bones reader.

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
Adam has an app

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
coming out on the iPhone

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
where you can subscribe to all Bones

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
emails.

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
Red in his voice.

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
Yeah, he really gets the better of me

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
in those missives, doesn't he?

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
He really gives me the old

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
Judd Apatow talking to Mark Brazil.

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
The old Touche.

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
I always feel like

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
I'm at the card table

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
next to the Algonquin round one.

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
I'm not allowed to

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
hang out with Groucho.

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
Yeah, I like that he has,

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
it's a dialogue to himself.

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
He's...

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
I'm not going to wait for the response.

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
Hey dipshit, you still a faggot?

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
I know you are.

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
Just kidding.

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
Let's get serious.

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
My balls are serious.

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
They look like your head.

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
Your head's a fucking dick.

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
Hey look, we're having a lot of fun here.

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
Let's cool it down.

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
I didn't come here to tell ball jokes.

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
He's retarded.

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
He has kids.

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
He's a father.

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
He's five years older than me.

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
He's got a niece that I've never met.

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
No, you have a niece.

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
I have a niece.

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
She does the hokey pokey.

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
He did some hanky-panky.

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
I got a...

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
Yeah.

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
Yeah, I...

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
I think there's some circuits.

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
Maybe loose wobbly.

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
Maybe burnt out in my head.

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
I'm always trying to figure out if it's genetic

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
or if it's nature or nurture.

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
But I know that my parents

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
and my distant family,

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
they all seem kind of reptilian to me.

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
But I think it must be me.

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
I think they seem like very

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
volatile, emotional people.

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
They'll write me things

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
and they're very excited

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
and emotional.

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
I remember being in my house growing up.

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
My mom and my brother were very emotional

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
with each other.

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
Some would say Freudianly

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
emotional with each other.

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
I felt like there was a connection.

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
Your mom and your brother had some sort of

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
weird silent seduction thing going on.

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
Yeah, I think they always felt like they were kind of like...

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
Fucking.

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
I don't think they were fucking,

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
but I felt like they were always thinking,

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
like, what if we could?

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
They always felt like they were still...

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
They felt like they were against all odds.

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
They were the Sam and Diane.

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
They were one family scuba trip

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
and a shark attack

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
from fulfilling their dreams.

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
Maybe in some post-apocalyptic

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
scenario, it would be

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
necessary for them to

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
have to

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
procreate the species.

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
They seemed game for it.

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
They were always hitting

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
and caressing them.

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
For instance, like, I don't know, like...

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
What?

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
Oh, God, thank you, Erin.

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
Yeah, I was telling my brother...

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
Well, I did this thing

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
in the bedroom.

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
Erin was laying in bed and I put a

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
sock over my dick and balls.

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
Who hasn't done that?

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
The chili peppers have done that.

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
You haven't done it. You have a vagina, ma'am.

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
That's like...

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
You're holding a sock in the morning

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
and you're naked.

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
I'm pretty sure every guy in here,

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
you don't have to admit it,

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
but you see if it'll fit over your

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
whole thing and it's hanging down.

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
Because I've seen that.

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
You haven't done it?

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
We lead vastly different lives.

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
I thought that would be the once upon a time,

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
like, oh yeah, we've all done that.

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
My brother used to do it in front of my mom.

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
He would, like, run into the...

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
We'd be watching, like, happy days

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
and my brother would run, like...

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
I feel like he was, like, 13

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
or, like, 15

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
or something, or 28.

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
I just remember

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
he was a big kid.

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
There's a 15-year-old playing in the U.S. open right now.

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
And he would run through the living room

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
like this and my mom would go,

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
whoa, stop it!

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
I don't know, man.

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
I don't know.

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
I don't know, man.

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
I...

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
My parents had...

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
I was born...

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
My mom was 41.

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
They were both 41.

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
They'd each been married once before

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
either or not, so they'd each had two kids.

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
So they kind of made all their parenting mistakes.

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
I think we got the good version of parenting

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
because they'd already, like, fucked up once before.

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
So when they had us, they were adults

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
and their hair was getting a little gray

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
and they were just groovy and mellow.

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
But it was also the late 70s and early 80s

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
and they had these really swanky parties,

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
fondue parties and shit.

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
All the guys looked like the Marlboro man.

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
They all had mustaches and shit.

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
They were cool and everyone could ride a horse.

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
And, like...

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
The women all smoked.

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
They were like...

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
My mom's friend Lorraine, she'd be like...

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
In a full cocktail dress, like, from, you know...

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
Someone from Anti-Mame.

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
And she'd be, like, in the kitchen,

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
smoking, like, a Virginia Slimans

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
during the Holland days for the fondue.

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
It was like an ash going into things.

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
It was awesome.

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
And they were kind of...

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
I looked up.

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
I thought, this is a real cocktail party going on there.

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
We were little kids and my brother used to...

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
We'd make an appearance.

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
These are the kids. They're going to bed.

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
Now we can go be adults and get drunk

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
and talk about adult things.

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
My brother would take off my pajamas.

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
He would strip me down. He was three years older than me.

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
Bill Davis would strip me down

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
and take my pajamas and run down the hallway

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
into the big opening.

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
Kind of giant living room.

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
It was almost like a dance floor.

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
The adults were gathered.

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
And he would throw my pajamas into the middle of the...

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
Of the foray.

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
And I would run naked out there.

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
And we'd grab him.

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
And we'd get a big laugh.

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
My older brother fucking with a kid.

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
I was three or four with it.

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
And I'd run back in.

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
And we kept doing it.

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
And then the laughter at Peter off after a while.

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
But I had...

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
My oldest sister is my mom's first marriage.

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
I have nieces that are...

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
One of them is two years younger than I.

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
So we would bathe together when we were really little.

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
So I got this male-female anatomy lesson

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
bathing with Stephanie.

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
And I would see the differences between

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
the male and female anatomy.

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
And at one of the parties I just emerged

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
like all the adults are drunk

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
and smoking.

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
And I walked out into the middle of the party and was like,

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
just put my hand up and just stopped.

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
They were like, oh shit.

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
And I was going to lay some...

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
Something I learned on them.

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
I was going to lay it down for them.

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
And I was like, everybody?

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
Boys?

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
Girls have crack-wees.

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
And then I...

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
To abject silence.

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
And I walked back down the long hallway

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
and I got to my room and then I remember just

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
applause.

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
And I was certain that I had done

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
a service.

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
I always hope...

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
Because you wonder why people are fighting.

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
Why is mom and dad always fighting?

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
Why is my sister fighting with this guy?

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
Why is the living room always dirty?

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
I thought you meant like...

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
My parents

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
like their furniture was magazine stacks.

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
Like they would just...

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
The stacks of shit that they wouldn't throw away.

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
They would just put shit down on top of it.

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
Like that hoarders show.

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
And then somebody would

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
come over and the word company would happen.

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
They go, we're having company tonight.

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
And then it could happen randomly.

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
But that meant clean the bathtub,

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
clean the toilet, get this shit

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
off of the living room floor.

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
My parents would look at their own shit

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
and go, what is this? What's going on?

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
We have company tonight.

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
They'd all of a sudden for 24 hours

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
they'd become healthy, normal people

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
and white glove themselves.

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
This is garbage.

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
There's no skippy peanut butter.

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
Just this peanut butter on a white label.

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
They're going to think we're abusive to our children.

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
Turn that around and make a fake theater pan logo.

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
Everything.

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
I put Willie Nelson on.

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
Buy a new record player.

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
This is the big deal.

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
And then everyone would come over.

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
They all had mustaches.

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
In the 70s they all looked like

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
what's it?

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
Barney Miller.

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
I was trying to have the cast of Barney Miller.

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
Or W.

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
Carapy and Cincinnati.

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
I was having a 70s party

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
with cocktail vases.

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
And that's where I would shine.

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
I would come out in my footies

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
and I'd go, hey!

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
What's going on?

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
And I'd go, how do you tell me?

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
Got a dance.

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
It didn't take anything.

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
And they'd be like, whoa!

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
What's this guy's name?

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
I'm going, you tell me!

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
I'm not telling.

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
And you just like fucking dance around.

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
But the remarkable thing is that my parents

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
would like...

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
They were powerless.

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
I had the Nielsen's.

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
So they were like, I can't...

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
There's nothing I can do.

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
So they were like, ha!

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
Daniel, go to bed!

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
But then Uncle Morty

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
and Francis from Marketing

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
would go like, no!

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
Get him out of here!

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
Hey, come on!

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
What's your opinion about spaghetti?

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
Spaghetti? You tell me!

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
Ha!

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
They were like, this kid's the best!

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
And my dad would be like, he's the best!

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
And eventually I'd get tired

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
of being a real world man.

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
I couldn't wait to turn 18

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
because as I understood it,

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
that's when you get to leave

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
and the whole world was waiting out there.

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
That's where all those people came from.

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
I was just trapped in this dirty house

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
with stacks of magazines used as card tables.

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
And then everyone's around, they'd go,

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
everyone, fake it!

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
And they'd go...

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
Everyone filled the airlock with eight people

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
from the real world.

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
And they loved me!

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
My sister Pam,

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
who is about 20 years old

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
tonight, because she was my mom's first marriage,

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
and she got married

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
to Marty, this really nice,

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
lovable guy. He looked like Mario

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
from the Super Mario games.

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
He was really pleasant and easy going.

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
Turned out later on that he was

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
a chronic liar.

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
They got divorced. He turned out to not be so hot.

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
But at the beginning stages,

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
we all loved Marty.

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
The first time I met him, I think I was four.

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
And I had to put a suit on.

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
And I hated putting a suit on back then.

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
I remember it's like...

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
Memories of me like when I'm four.

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
God damn it, put the tie on.

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
This is so stupid.

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
But also, it was the 70s.

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
I had a red, white, and blue plaid suit.

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
It was fucked up.

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
It was bad.

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
So I got all dressed up.

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
I had my little penny loafers on.

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
And I was playing like Battlestar Galactica

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
Cylons in my room.

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
Your sister's boyfriend is out front.

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
They were engaged to get married.

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
And I was so angry at this

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
phantom guy coming into our house.

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
I didn't know who he was. I just hated him already.

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
And again,

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
like Crack Wheeze and Pee Wee Wheeze

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
and things like that.

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
Men and women were different.

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
He was an enemy. So he comes in

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
and they go,

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
Jeffrey, get out of there. Marty's here.

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
And this nice guy, big guy.

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
A big kind of hulking guy.

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
Like gets down low and puts his arms out.

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
And I run down the hallway.

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
I used to run down naked to get my pajamas and stuff.

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
And I run down right at him.

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
And he's got his arms out. And I had nothing in my mind.

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
I had no plan of attack.

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
I just kicked him square in the balls.

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
And you've probably seen some movie

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
or something where that was funny.

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
I just felt like he was...

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
When...

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
You expected it to make a boing noise.

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
No, like when Han Solo

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
was sitting and having dinner with Landon Calrissian

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
and Darth Vader or something, he just starts shooting.

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
He doesn't say anything. He goes,

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
he blocks it.

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
But when you see an enemy, you just attack.

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
And I just ran. I went, bang!

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
And hit him.

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
And if you don't have balls,

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
a four-year-old's penny lovers can do the job.

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
Absolutely.

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
And all I remember was I hit him.

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
Oh!

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
There are about 15 people in attendance.

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
And no one saw that coming.

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
At least of who are Marty.

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
And the whole...

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
Oh!

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
And Marty tipped over like a fucking...

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
Just like a chingar.

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
Went right over.

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
And I hung a hard right and ran out the front door

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
and climbed a tree.

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
And there's...

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
I hit the awesome tree out of the front.

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
I'm like, fuck this guy. I'm a climber tree. Be a kid.

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
Fuck you. Fuck you.

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
When a cat runs into a wall, it just starts licking itself.

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
Yeah, you caught me in the middle

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
of my run into a wall, then licked myself

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
for regiment.

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
So I bone out. I get out. I'm out front.

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
I'm climbing a tree. And I hear a combination

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
of laughter, horror, moaning.

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
Marty's...

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
Marty's having a medical emergency.

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
Everybody's laughing.

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
Some people are like...

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
It was chaos inside the house.

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
I could hear it. So I'm climbing a tree.

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
I'm up there in a tree. I remember this so vividly.

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
I was about to be four years old.

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
Beautiful day. Something California.

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
I was like, this is the stuff.

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
I just took down that motherfucker.

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
Climb on my tree.

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
I think the instinct was to go be king of the castle.

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
Like, get high.

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
Like, you know, separate yourself.

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
Go back to heaven.

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
Where gods live. Where titans dwell.

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
And then I fell out the tree.

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
Because I was wearing penny loafers.

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
And you don't gain a lot of purchase

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
with the fucking footing on a tree

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
with the penny loaf around.

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
And I fell straight backwards.

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
That got my foot caught

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
in a crunch of a limb.

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
My foot got fricking caught me.

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
I would have broken my neck and probably died.

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
Oh, the kids are pretty supple.

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
But I fell to my death and got caught.

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
And now I'm hanging upside down by one foot.

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
And at four years old,

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
I don't have the core strength.

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
You'll get that later at 25.

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
You'll be like...

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
When I learned to stop kicking people in the balls.

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
So I'm trying to...

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
At some point, now I'm out of steam.

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
Because dinner was about to happen.

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
And I decided to kick a dude in the balls.

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
To climb a tree. And now I'm alone.

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
And what I can't do

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
is appeal for help.

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
So I was out there with the blood rushing in my head

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
for what I think was an hour.

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
And finally people got worried about me

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
and it came out. And then there was more laughter.

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
And I...

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
Guess who came and got me?

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
Yeah.

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
Uncle Sam.

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
Yeah.

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
That was the worst.

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
We had a tweet

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
that came in 21 minutes ago

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
at Harmontown.

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
It said, finish your Indiana Jones tangent.

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
Oh, your picture.

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
You're going to make an Indiana Jones movie.

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
Wait, was that what it is?

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
Oh, the right.

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
We went on the right. We went to Disneyland.

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
It was fun.

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
Happy...

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
Slater?

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
Slater?

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
Is that a reference to my show?

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
I don't like the right that much.

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
I remember when it came out.

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
I was very excited about it.

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
But it's not the best.

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
Disneyland has a weird hypnotic thing going where

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
you're so satisfied with so little.

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
But they also, though,

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
they do so many things so right.

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
I can't figure it out.

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
We went to Magic Mountain together.

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
And that's all just about thrills, chills, and spills.

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
And I haven't been paid to tell you that.

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
But that's just walking around a park

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
like you're going from one roller coaster to another.

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
The most terrifying one of all,

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
the X2 or whatever,

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
because they won't fucking tell you

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
what it is.

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
Everything is like, oh, it's the Coco Puffs ride.

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
You're crazy for Coco Puffs.

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
You have to help me find more

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
Coco on this ride.

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
It's the best ride.

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
It's stupid.

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
But the X2 thing, the whole ride,

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
they keep going, are you ready for this?

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
Do you know what you're doing?

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
Have you said goodbye to your loved ones?

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
They changed it because when it was just X.

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
Have you guys been to Magic Mountain and been on X or X2?

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
Fucking good.

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
If you like scary rides.

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
But the original, I'm certain of this.

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
I went on it like three times.

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
Keep your hands and arms inside of the train

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
at all times, like that little spiel you get.

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
The X1 was like, everybody,

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
you're about to be on X.

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
X is a thrilling experience.

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
You leave your keys with somebody

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
you trust because you're about to go on X.

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
It's really crazy.

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
Drink some orange juice.

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
Your jaw may wiggle a little bit.

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
They were really preparing you for it.

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
You expect unsolicited back rubs

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
and expressions

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
of intent to call one another more often.

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
Millennials will call it E.

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
I was told by some guy that came in

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
at a pitch meeting

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
he was telling me about the four stages

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
that generations go through.

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
Baby boomers are the blah, blah, blah generation.

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
And the generation X is this.

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
They always react to the previous generation

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
and then the X.

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
It sounded like it was such a bullshit.

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
I can't articulate.

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
I wanted to throw a rock at the guy's head.

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
I was like, what are you saying?

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
You're just saying what your brain wants to be the case.

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
There's nothing entertaining about this tangent.

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
It was so interesting to me

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
because of course we all think in rhythms of four

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
but we're all projecting like, oh yeah.

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
Remember that World War II generation?

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
Like they sat around saying that.

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
No, let's be a big generation

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
and go fight World War II.

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
We spent the entire days

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
people do at Disneyland

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
talking about all the many people

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
who have died at Disneyland.

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
Which alarms me because I have to figure that

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
that means like a 40 people die at Magic Mountain

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
every week and no one talks about it.

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
There's like 15 things.

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
Google Disneyland deaths, it's very interesting.

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
The most horrific one

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
is the Mark Twain boats coming in.

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
I wasn't working that day

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
but I was an employee of Disneyland

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
when that happened.

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
I did a show right in front of that.

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
It could have happened right there.

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
I was there with Gorley and you were there too.

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
He was saying, yeah, I worked here

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
when that smoke mountain

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
decapitation happened

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
or something like, what was it?

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
Thunder Mountain, the railroad.

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
And then...

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
There's two groups of people

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
that know what I'm talking about

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
and they're like, get to your fucking point.

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
I'm sorry about that.

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
I want to describe the one Disneyland death

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
that is amazing to me.

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
Yeah.

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
It's the Mark Twain boat coming in.

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
It's so gross.

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
And when it comes around

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
if it's beyond a certain speed

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
you're supposed to let it go all the way around.

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
And the people on board,

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
ladies and gentlemen, coming in too fast

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
wouldn't want a horrible thing to happen.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
So we're going all the way around.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
And I'm sure everyone's like,

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
fuck you, you fucking dick.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
I got a fast pass to the fucking

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Green Lantern's asshole.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Have you ever seen...

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
I got to be there at 1030

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
or I'm going to fucking lose the time of my life.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
You're fucking around with me, you fucking bureaucrats.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
What they don't know is that what happens

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
when you don't do that

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
is this.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
The river boat came in a little too fast.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
The manager on duty

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
didn't know enough to let it go.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
I think he was not the regular guy.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
I'm not sure how much is apocryphal, as you say.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
A word I learned from you. How much isn't.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
But I read this on

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
many websites.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
And they had animated gifts

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
on the side that were like,

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
but skulls that had mouse ears on them.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
So

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
I think this is the real story.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
The river boat came in.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
They didn't, they tied it off

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
even though it was coming in too fast.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
The rope went tout

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
and the first thing that

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
happened is it, how are you supposed to say tout?

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
Tout.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
You say tout? Tout.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
No, a tout is a guy that gives you tips on a race track.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
Bagel.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
Bagel.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
Fuck you guys.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
Honestly, if you're going to teach people

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
English like Google,

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
I mean, I only ever read these words.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
I never heard anyone say them.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
My mom never said tout.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
Tout.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
Tout? I read it. I know what it means.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
Dan still says bagel. It's a bagel.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
It's a bag, the first three letters are bag.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
You put shit in a bag.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
You guys are dicks.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
I just don't get it.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
And one day you will.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
The

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
rope stretches

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
to tout?

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
Yeah.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
It goes hanky-panky.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
That was embarrassing.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
I'm sorry about that.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
Across the shins

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
of the guy

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
who called for the

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
tying off of the thing, snaps both of his

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
shins in half because it goes so tight.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
That's chapter one.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
I wouldn't even mention this story

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
if that's all that happened.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
The rope then pulls on the metal cleat

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
in the dock so hard

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
that the metal cleat

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
uproots from the wood and slingshots

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
at the speed of sound across

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
Disneyland and explodes a dude's head.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
Yeah.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
From what I remember, and again,

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
who knows how much is apocryphal or not,

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
but one guy's foot got mostly severed,

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
I believe, and I went through a guy's head

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
who got mostly decapitated.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
The guy's shoe, I don't know how familiar

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
you are with Frontierland,

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
but

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
apparently the dude's foot,

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
the guy's shoe landed in the Mexican restaurant,

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
which is

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
it's not

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
right there. It's a long

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
way for a shoe to go if your foot's still in it.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
Yeah, Frontierland,

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
you'd be racist to assume

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
Frontierland is right where the Mexican

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
restaurants are.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
It was in civilized,

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
it was a Tomorrowland

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
Mexican restaurant

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
that served only progressive Mexican food.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
They had

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
hologram refried beans

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
and laser

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
churros.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
Anyways, you've left out the important part.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
The shoe

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
had the foot still in it.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
I believe so. The thing went

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
through a guy's face and knocked his head off

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
and there was blood everywhere, apparently,

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
and then went through a guy's foot and the foot landed

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
in someone's enchilada

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
and then it's in the news for

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
an hour,

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
because Disneyland owns the entire goddamn

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
world and they go, hey everybody

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
you can run this for 24 hours and then

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
if you run it again,

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
we'll shut you down.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
By the time the newspapers ran it, the story

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
was that Disneyland had a new severed foot

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
world.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
They had created

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
a whole mythology. There were costume characters,

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
there was a mayor

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
of severed foot world,

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
there was a new ride,

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
Mark Ruffalo was there.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Everyone

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
was pretending to have one foot and

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
they were singing a song that was written by Randy Newman.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
It was

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
it's a dystopia.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
It's a dystopic.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
You got a foot in your food.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
You got a foot in your food.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
I don't need no foot because

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
I'm not in the mood.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
I said you got

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
a foot in your food.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
Thank you for coming to Harmontown. Adam everybody.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
One more time for Adam.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
Thank you all for coming.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
You guys are the best. Thank you so much.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
We love you. Dan Harmon. I'm Jeff Davis.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Thank you everybody here at Nerd Melt.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
Halloween.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
We're going to get it on.
