clock's hand goes around every time I lost your mama's position

03:31.000 --> 03:44.000
all right welcome to Harmontown everybody how many left what's the

03:44.000 --> 03:59.000
clock on Harmontown how many more shows do we have before I guess four or four or five left four to go seven doesn't matter all right let's look at what do we get I guess it changes things now that you live way up in valley village

03:59.000 --> 04:21.000
we got the oh it was everybody watching this football game there was a cat on the football field the cat came out poor cat all right look how does a cat end up on a football field so how does a cat end up on a football there's no fucking cat who brings a cat to a game there's a

04:21.000 --> 04:48.000
good idea all right packer fan I would guess the bangles so a cat's on a football field oh I'm sorry do you do you want my input I relate for the war syllables yeah well just this is not your you've sacrificed your your titular duties

04:48.000 --> 05:08.000
you've sacrificed your tits well careful what you wish for what so what did the cat do Dan what happened to the cat the cat walked no nothing no reaction to the word walked you guys don't have a funny

05:08.000 --> 05:31.000
reaction to the word walked the cat walked on it walked on it walked on guys come on react I would you didn't it didn't walk in the cat walked on the the football field

05:31.000 --> 05:51.000
I don't believe tell us your cat story Dan so it's American this is gonna be great how great

05:51.000 --> 06:05.000
okay let's back it up why were you watching football in the first place you're not I don't think he was you're not a sporty it's just it's a TV like what is in a bar these days except mirrors and TVs like there was a thing and there was a cat on the TV

06:05.000 --> 06:24.000
so the cats like walking across the field and there's like everyone's cheering and there's it's this black cat and I'm thinking like I don't think that that cat lives in a football arena it was very fat they were showing like close ups of the cat I had like a double chin

06:24.000 --> 06:43.000
and like okay I bet a football fan because we know like and I respect the athletes they're very superstitious people I get that when you push yourself to the physical limits like you're gonna be superstitious I don't look down on that if it's if honestly it's you competing with God you're

06:43.000 --> 06:58.000
superstitious like you're like I'm a linebacker there's nothing between me there's no commercial way to measure my ability no way to do it yeah like like so if your socks you know famously like athletes they're like oh I don't I only wear these socks they're very superstitious people

06:58.000 --> 07:12.000
superstitious sailors and athletes and actors very so I would say like the odds are probably the opposing team I think that they I think that there was a stunt how does a black cat end up running onto a football field

07:12.000 --> 07:22.000
was it fully black or did it have fully white you know totally black what city was this in what was the home stadium does anyone know the answer to that question

07:22.000 --> 07:28.000
also the Giants versus the Cowboys was it

07:28.000 --> 07:46.000
Steve okay so a black cat crossed the Giants meadowlands wherever the fuck that feels I just gotta imagine that would play hell with any football player worth their salt like if the game was worth anything like and that if you were an opposing team you'd be like also don't you think

07:46.000 --> 08:00.000
there should be an arms race you'd be like you know how we get these fuckers I heard that so and so on the opposing team is like really superstitious like you should step on a crack just bring just bring your aunt Stacy's cat in a bag

08:00.000 --> 08:05.000
you let it go you put the quarterback under a ladder

08:05.000 --> 08:21.000
so he has to I don't think any fan gets into an arena with a cat in a bag I don't think that any cat like lives in a football arena and then ends up in the field I believe that one of those teams it isn't a jersey though the Giants play in Jersey

08:21.000 --> 08:34.000
yeah so it's fucking Jersey baby you don't you don't know what's going to go on you just think that new Jersey Jersey baby their lax culture you don't think they're you think their football arena is more prone to have just like I don't know like fucking

08:34.000 --> 08:50.000
okay here's what I think you said the cat was fat it was very fat how fat was he it was fat enough that it had like a perceivable double chin and that like if you're watching it and you were a cat person or even an animal person

08:50.000 --> 09:09.000
your heart went like oh I I I heard I heard the fat was tuned cat I heard the cat was so fat that when it stands in a street corner the cops y'all break it up the cat the cat that's how fat Rob Rob how fat was that cat

09:09.000 --> 09:23.000
it's not like it had a double chin it had a double chin yeah yeah and how do you how do you tell I didn't see the they showed like because the thing is they got so many they're like you can see it in the live moment

09:23.000 --> 09:43.000
the cat the sports castors are so excited because the cat was like running in the end zone and so of course the sports castors are doing their job they're going like oh look at his double chuckleback like you know like like the cats like running from the people that are trying to get it out of the field and they're like oh that cats got a good quick quick change or whatever like like like they're having the time of their lives they live for this shit

09:43.000 --> 10:12.000
he came back out dressed as a clown and but then came back out dressed as Sharon then coming back from commercial then they had all these instant replays because they go to the slo-mo footage of the cat galloping and it's it's got a little bit of saliva coming up its lips which is not quite enough for you to go oh it's a rabid cat but it was just enough like oh the cat's going under a great deal of stress like I just if the cat hadn't been overweight I would have been like fine it's like a cat that's like it's it's got its own thing

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
it's got its own thing going on

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
it was clearly a fat cat

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
it sounds like your cat shaman right

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
it had been imported into that arena

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
somebody got rid of that cat

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
somebody brought that cat in there

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
you looked at that cat and you're like

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
that cat has a name

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
that cat like loves

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
certain food

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
it was sad somebody fuck

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
somebody brought that cat in there and let it out of a box

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
that's a drag

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
that's all I want to say

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
do you think a fat cat

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
is worse luck than a skinny cat?

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
and I just think

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
that those sports people

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
look at all those sports people that get all excited

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
oh there's a cat in the field

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
yeah that's your invitation

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
don't be a sports person

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
go home and play with your cat

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
you love cats so much

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
isn't it delightful

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
oh there's a cat out there go home

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
stop tearing out this shit

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
I heard that cat

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
that cat was so fat

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
the cat was so fat

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
that its cat food was made by

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
Halliburton

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
Halliburton

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
and they got picked up

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
come back for another episode

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
that's great

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
I didn't get a second season

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
it's always good

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
that cat was so fat

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
was he

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000

like some sort of viral sensation

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
has everyone loved it

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
do you think in the future

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
I was at this bar

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
and I was like god damn

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
hey

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
could I charge my phone

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
getting below 20%

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
I'm in the red

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
bartender

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
yeah is that an android

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
no of course not

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
civilized human being

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
I'm not ready to

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
acquiesce to that

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
you're not Klingon

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
oh no I can't

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
I'm in the red

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
and my friend goes like it's fine

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
and then I was like this is like camping

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
it's the new camping

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
there will come a time when there's no wilderness left

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
the new camping is going below 20%

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
on your iPhone battery

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
there won't be woods anymore

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
you'll go out to a strip mall

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
and you'll have 20% battery

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
and you'll tell your kids

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
you kids do you know how to deal with

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
only having 20% battery

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
and your kids will be like

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
I want to be a different gender

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
with a USB port

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
and you're like you can't be a different gender

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
you're gonna be the gender you were born

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
and

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
you're gonna learn

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
to make a flashlight

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
with only 20% of your battery

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
yeah cause you gotta decide

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
how much candy you can crush

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
until you get back to the

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
to the power

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
do you think the definition of camping

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
will change

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
as we evolve as a society

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
do you think it'll eventually become

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
hey I went camping the other day

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
will it eventually mean

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
how much did you go camping

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
well

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
back in the day camping was just

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
that's where you lived

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
we graduated to

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
building a house outside our tent

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
and then moved in

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
when did we start calling it

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
homelessness

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
we started we became bullies

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
yeah

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
how good does your tent have to be

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
before people are like that's a house

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
I think it mad at you

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
start mowing the lawn

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
come on quit it

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
I made a tent and it's got a square roof

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
with gutters in case it rains

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
that's called a house

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
you anti camper

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
but then you gotta start building it

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
out of different materials

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
you can't just build your new house out of straw

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
if houses

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
if houses become made out of lasers

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
that just repel everything

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
then if you make

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
your house out of bricks

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
that'll be the new tent

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
it's like oh

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
the cub scouts will go out and everybody

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
make a brick with your 3D printer

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
now make a house

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
oh we used to be a nature

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
hoyo hoyo

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
it'll be all racist and shit

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
no I don't fucking

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
oh don't forget your screen door

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
then you get your badge for being a

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
Navajo

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
it'll all be downgraded

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
no I agree

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
okay thank you good it's good to be on the same page once in a while

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
speaking of housing

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
and tents and what not

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000

you're kind of well you're

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
sleeping on an air mattress it's kind of like

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
it's not air mattress no we got a mattress

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
in a box frame but we don't have a bed frame

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
a mattress

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
instead of a mat...ter

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
a matador

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
that's the old days

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
before Oprah at the Oscars

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
a matrix

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
time's up no more matadors

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000

looking good

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
looking real fucking good

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
I planned my estate today

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
looking real good

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
why does he wait to bring the vodka out

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
why is that a reveal

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
we're pacing the show

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
I planned my estate today

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
yeah

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
like what the book told you to do last week

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
that's right

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
how much weight should I give death in my life

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
the answer is as much as it earns

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
I'm sorry Dan I missed that you did what to your estate

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
I planned it

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
you did what to your estate

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
I planned it

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
I told that estate hey motherfucker

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
I'm gonna fucking plan you

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
then I'm gonna take you I'm gonna double suplex you

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
you heard me estate I'm coming to get you

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
I'm Ricky the nature man

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
hey estate you think you can have me

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
I'm gonna have you I'm gonna bequeath you

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
I'm gonna take you from the top ropes

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
it's me the decedent

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
Dan Harmon the decedent's gonna take you

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
I'm gonna come up from the front I'm gonna bend you in half

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
hey estate

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
I'm gonna plan you

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
I'm gonna put you in a trust

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
I'm gonna deduct your

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
exemptions

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
what's the difference between

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
like planning your estate and just

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
having a will is that it's the same

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
it's the same

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
it's a little confusing

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
the will

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
a will is

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
kind of

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
governmental

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
everybody has

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
the right to have a will

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
I'm not sure about wills

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
like

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
trust

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
this sounds like a real will they won't they

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
I know

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
in terms of like coding

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
thank you trust

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
four more shows left

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
trust supersede wills

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
so your will

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
like when you die it's sort of a

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
court based thing so there's

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
there's no need to fuck with a trust

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
unless somebody like

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
raises a ruckus and goes

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
like you know you see it famously

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
like when what's your name

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
playmate lady

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
you know had a reality show

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
what was her name

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
correct and Nicole Smith

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
like it's a classic case

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
like somebody's like

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
oh the husband leaves everything

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
to her but then the family will

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
contest the will because it's

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
like open to be contested but if there's

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
a strong enough trust

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
like there's nothing can be

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
contested trusts are

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
like they're more iron clad

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
they're done with people that like

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
fucking stamp the shit and it's done

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
and like no court's gonna like overrule them

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
so as long as everything's in order

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
so you know are we

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
getting a piece of that action

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
I Schrab is

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
if

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
if

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
like what

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
what but only

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
if Cody and I die in the same bus

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
okay okay no and

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
don't tell Rob that don't tell Rob that

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
no no no but Schrab

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
he's gonna rent you a fucking bus

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
but if Cody and I

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
die together

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
Schrab has to deal with so much

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
uh

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
Schrab becomes a trustee

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
he has to deal with so much

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
prison reform and autism

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
you don't even want to

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
it'll be me laughing at you from the grade

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
I get it I get it

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
make sure those guys don't suffer too much

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
thanks

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
have fun with my money you fucking

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
slob

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
that's good

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
that's a good bit you know

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
you're allowed to refuse

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
I said to the lady I'm like can you just name

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
any yahoo your trustee

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
can I just see a dude on the sidewalk

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
and be like that's my trustee

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
like Sylvester Stallone and rhinestone cowboy

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
like you're just like that guy

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
and she's like yeah you can

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
but then he has a right to refuse it

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
but you could just like pick somebody out go

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
that's my trustee I want my trustee to be

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
piven

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
and like he might not refuse

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
you could just like use your will

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
you could be like I want Jeremy

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
piven to like

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
do you get like a book of like what you're supposed to do

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
or do they just like okay

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
you can do anything I mean a trust is basically

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
it's like coding like you can program

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
anything you want and it's

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
you're not allowed to for instance

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
tell people to do anything illegal

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
you can't obviously say

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
I leave

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
Rob but only if he kills Spencer

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
you

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
but then again you don't just get the million

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
dollars like they'll

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
just say well you don't get the million dollars

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
but you don't have to kill Spencer

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
they're like if you kill Spencer you go to jail

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
like I can't

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
I can't supersede the law

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
but I can make you do

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
stuff for money

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
Rob I can

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
say you have to spend

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
ten million dollars in forty eight hours

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
it's weird

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
the other thing that's weird is like this whole thing

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
of exemption so there's this thing called the

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
estate tax

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
and

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
it's like right now

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
apparently courtesy of Trump

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
it's like double what it was

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
which is comical because what it was

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
was like six million or

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
five million dollars

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
it's like that's the number that if

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
that's what you're worth when you die

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
none of your shit is taxed

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
that you're bequeathing

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
but if now

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
because of Trump it's doubled

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
ooh score one for rich people

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
like what

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
but like so

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
now it's like currently it's like

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
eleven point four million dollars

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
if you die and you're worth less than that

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
you don't have to worry about forty percent of your money

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
getting taken if you die

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
with eleven point three nine million

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
dollars it's all good man

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
give it to whoever you want none of it's taxed

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
eleven point four million dollars

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
boom forty percent

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
right to the government as you go

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
like I don't care I'm liberal I gave my money

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
half of my money away when I was alive

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
who cares but you think about Cody

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
right if I die I want Cody

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
to be set up I don't want Cody to find out

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
almost half of all the shit

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
like is gone

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
so then they go like oh here's how that works

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
you put it in this box and you put it in that box

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
and you put it in that box it's so weird

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
it almost seems like

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
like senators

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
like lawmakers

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
they must like campaign

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
and then get poor people's votes by going like

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
and here's another thing

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
if I'm elected I'm gonna make

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
rich people like when they

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
die they're gonna have to give half their money away

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
and then everyone's like that's an easy thing

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
to root for I'm never gonna have that much money

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
cause fuck rich people

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
and then it's cool

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
I get that it makes sense

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
you vote for that person that person gets a

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
chair and like the congress

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
and but the thing is

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
then

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
like it's just like

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
this whole system of lawyers and

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
accountants and things underneath are like

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
yeah but how are we really gonna deal with that

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
and the answer is well the definition

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
of this is that and it just like

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
it just all settles anyway

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
it's like you can't actually create

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
revolution through anything

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
goodnight folks

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
I just found that by like

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
like my this person was like

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
cause I'm panicking now

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
I gotta make sure

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
Mike Mandel was

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
healthier than me

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
and I don't even know

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
what like I hope his house was in order

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
but like

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
my god if there was ever a sign

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
it's like you gotta get your shit in order

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
like make sure that tomorrow god

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
forbid something happens to you

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
like god damn it make sure everything

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
don't let your last thought be

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
oh my god Cody's gonna get kicked out of her house

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
um

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
and uh and so like

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
you I just like and then you

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
go in and you're like learning about this whole

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
tron escape of like how your

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
money gets divided

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
and it's just creepy and weird

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
I don't understand our species I think we're fucking

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
dumb

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
I think we're vile people

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
I don't think we ever do anything

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
in good faith I think we're kind of like

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
shitty animals

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
that have been cursed with sentience

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
yeah that's probably it

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
I think you're

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
I think you're totally right

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
we're shitty animals that

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
that

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
that know we're gonna die someday

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
yeah I mean that's it

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
we call that intelligence

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
like we go like

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
hey how come dogs are so dumb

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
don't they know they're gonna die?

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
dummy like well how much

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
smarter are they if they know they're gonna die

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
they'd be writing books

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
yeah

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
they'd certainly be worse at fetch

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
they'd be like alright I brought you the ball back

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
yeah but what's in it for me

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
I need to go climb dog Everest

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
I'm gonna paint a picture

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
I'm gonna lay in the sun

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
and I'm gonna fucking shit on myself

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
I heard heard about this Hawaii

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
hey Dan did you know Spencer Rob

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
that I ran into a couple people today

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
or over the last couple days that people

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
have flown from all over the

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
country to like to be here

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
like prove it

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
Jersey where else

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
Texas

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
Jersey, Texas, Oklahoma

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
Florida

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
Beowulf's not a state

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
just yelling out your home

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
Montana

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
Montana, dear heavens

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
sorry this is electricity don't be

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
afraid

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
Billings where you from

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
Bozeman well done

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
who came the father

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
Australia

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
but you didn't come here for this

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
you came probably for like to do fun things

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
get up here

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
get up here

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
well the Australian didn't

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
necessarily

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
yay

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
alright what's your name madam

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
omnia

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
we've met before don't worry

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
about it

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
I don't

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
you were very drunk

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
you were very unmemorable

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
oh shit

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
how unmemorable is she

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
welcome to America

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
this is insane

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
like this podcast has been a part of my life

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
since it started

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
it's insane

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
is your mic on by the way

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
should I try this one

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
I'm sure it's not

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
by the way I heard the podcast last time

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
I think the second one works

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
it was going fine but like one of the mics

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
like the monitors are on

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
there we go hey

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
but the thing is they're both on

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
I noticed that listening to them so you're good

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
but

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
you seem very young

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
23 on this trip

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
so if you've been like

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
since childhood

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
you've been following the podcast

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
you're like a Harmontown baby

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
well I'm a community baby

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
I was a fan of community

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
around about when it started and then

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
I became a fan of the podcast the moment it started

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
and I got to see it when I was at Nerdmelt which was huge

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
for me

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
and then it's kind of weird now

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
I'm kind of shaking a little bit it's awesome

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
I go to sleep to this podcast every night

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
like no cap

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
so do I

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
ahhhh

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
how is that

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
joke not

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
it took 8 years for that joke to

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
it's like such a classic

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
Carson

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
I go to sleep to this podcast

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
me and both brother

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
go on

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
I was just saying it's like

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
it's a parasocial thing

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
it's like I know you guys even though I don't know

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
you guys

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
the fact that I came to the show last week

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
because while we were here I thought

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
I came here specifically for this

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
I tried to make it so I got two in

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
just because we can only do two weeks

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
so I tried to get it so we came to do so I was there

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
last week and I'm here this week

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
and I'm so glad I got Schrab both times

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
this is the best

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
fuck yeah

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
double Schrab

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
you're gonna get those Schrab episodes I get it

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
the iconic ones

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
all the way

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
yeah I get it

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
yeah

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
some people like me

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
I left you all my money

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
if Cody dies

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
you only have to share it with all

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
autistic people and prisoners

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
Omnia you're just simply on a

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
little holiday here

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
yeah it was my birthday and I knew

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
Harmontown was ending so I had to

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
get my final trip to Mecca

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
in kind of thing

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
but also not

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
I flew from London but I'm from Cambridge

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
actually alright that's fancy

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
it sounds like

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
did you go to school there? are you on

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
Oxford? no I'm a local

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
I could have gone but

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
right yeah

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
do you're 23 now you said? I am yeah

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
what's it like to be a 23 year old

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
European

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
do you mean a taste of that life?

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
well

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
are you a Washington student with loans or

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
no I skipped all of that

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
I just went into being

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
self-employed and making my own

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
art and stuff

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
musician

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
how does that work are you comfortable doing that?

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
well I mean

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
I'm having a bit of a yearly crisis of

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
confidence right now so comfortable

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
I'm not quite sure

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
I learned

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
for a path right now with the internet

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
it seems like everything's got easier

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
but actually

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
especially because I didn't go to uni

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
it's gotten much harder and as a 23 year old

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
I'm right between the millennials

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
that have been dealt a hard

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
hand and the Gen Z's

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
who basically have no idea what they're doing

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
so I'm kind of right in the middle

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
of that limbo

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
yeah what's your

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
what is your dream gig

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
to be a musician

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
are you a singer?

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
singer, songwriter, producer

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
Gen Z we've got to be everything

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
you've got to be your marketer

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
you've got to be a YouTuber

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
you've got to do your Instagram

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
you've got to produce your music

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
write your own music so I do all of that

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
they're going to call you guys the

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
aerosol generation

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
you've got to be diversified

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
you've got to be scattered across the

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
because you've got to be guarded against

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
everybody we used to joke when I was

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
your age it was like

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
obviously they're never going to replace

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
writers so we're safe

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
it's really not really

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
it's like

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
no I don't think so

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
well the thing is is that

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
the next Dan Harmon

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
is going to be a robot

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
well maybe the next next

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
Dan Harmon

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
but the next Dan Harmon the person that's coming up behind you

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
is making YouTube videos where they're also

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
doing the whole saying and they're also

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
sourcing the location and they're sourcing

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
their own kind of outfits

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
and makeup and hair and they're doing

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
the whole production just to get a foot

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
in the door

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
that's what Dan did though

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
exactly and I think we have more of

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
an outlet but like

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
maybe it just seems like this way to us

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
so you can correct me and I will

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
as a European I will bow to your better wisdom

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
but

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
for us it seems like

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
if you guys it was simple

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
you kind of got your

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
thing like you did something

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
that got a little bit of buzz

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
and then maybe you got an agent or you got someone that was going to

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
kind of help you get in a couple more doors

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
and then there was just the progression

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
where you do one thing gets better

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
for us it feels like you get that one viral moment

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
or you get that one successful thing and it goes away for 10 years

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
again maybe that's not new

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
I will pitch you something

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
as an armchair biologist

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
I

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
look at it as like

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
a reversal of how

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
biology developed where

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
it when you have

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
capillary

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
tissue arteries and things

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
like you have channels that shoot

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
you from point A to point B

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
so then you have things like privilege like

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
oh you're born white and you're born in this

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
neighborhood you're born in this class

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
system and you're like it's easier

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
for you to shoot up to these like

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
branching trees of like

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
you end up in the writer's room you're getting Gary's

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
Chandling sandwiches and you end up like being a writer

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
at things and that

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
comparatively today

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
what you have is more of a sponge

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
it's like

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
so it's like almost like because

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
the way that that stuff evolved was like

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
you start with moss and moss

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
is like growing on a rock and it didn't have

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
they were

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
I've been lost I'm so sorry

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
well it's just like the idea that there's

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
Omnia pay attention it's about Gary's

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
sandwiches

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
I have no idea

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
exactly

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
that doesn't matter that part doesn't matter

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
okay no I'm this thing I'm this thing

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
but I'm saying like in terms of biology

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
like if you fast

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
forward from moss

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
to trees to humans

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
the key element

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
is like the increasing

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
sophistication of channels

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
by which you're like delivering nutrients

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
from the earth to like these

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
upper parts

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
four more shows to go you guys

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
if you go

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
backwards you end up with just like this

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
sponge shit on a rock

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
and you're

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
you're reliant on just getting

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
splashed with water

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
I think that's what millennials are

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
and certainly Gen Zers

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
and Gen Gooby Goobers

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
or whatever that there's

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
fame is just fucking

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
YouTube is just like

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
everyone's famous

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
fuck everyone

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
and everyone's just like subscribe and like

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
and subscribe and like

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
and it's like you can't

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
you have no recourse to individuality

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
you have no recourse to

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
being like subversive

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
like subversive are you kidding you'd be

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
fucking checked in a second are you kidding me

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
you fucking have a subversive opinion

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
fuck you fuck you fuck you

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
not even just subversive opinion but like

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
if you do anything that's not gonna get a

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
paid audience you're screwed

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
and they fucked us

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
the corporations have succeeded

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
in reverse evolutionizing

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
the youth so that

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
they're in charge of the

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
seawater and all the humanity

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
is now moss

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
no one's gonna grow up above the

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
skyline no one's gonna fucking

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
make their own biosphere

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
she gets it you don't

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
I know I get it I get it

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
I think what you're trying to say

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
it's waiting it's all of

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
it's now kind of it's not as connected

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
anymore so it's all just happening randomly

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
and you're waiting for that rainfall

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
I warned kids about this

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
at a million media conferences

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
they go they summoned me to these

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
things they used to before I got me too

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
they'd be like Dan Harmon come

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
you and Russell Simmons

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
and Norman Lear and fucking Jay Leno

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
come sit on this table in Miami

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
and fucking talk about the future of media

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
with the CEO of Heinz Ketchup and Howie Mandel

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
and

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
and I'd be like okay

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
I'll do that and then like there'd be this

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
kid and I have a cooking show on YouTube and he'd be like

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
bro why should I have to be in this table

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
when the truth is on Vine

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
I could have a million hits before I walk out

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
of this room and I'd be like

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
bro the reason is because your antenna

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
is built out of ones and zeroes

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
by a fucking corporation and they're gonna pull

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
the rug out from under you

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
and you're dependent like right now

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
the biggest most

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
the most

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
democratic of the platforms

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
is YouTube and

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
it's awful because

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
every five minutes something gets pulled

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
they're converting everything

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
to this labor intensive thing

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
they don't want any

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
individual to have power

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
they reward

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
popularity

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
for the same reason that we did in

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
high school which is that it's like this human impulse

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
to go actually the least

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
remarkable the most

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
average you need the dough

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
and like the most smooth

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
fucking most

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
cockazoid fucking average thing

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
like who's the least offensive

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
wow

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
and let that rise to the top

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
but then let that fall because it's mediocre

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
so it will fall don't let anything

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
shoot up and create a stalagmite

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
don't let anything actually affect

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
the skyline because

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
I mean I'm 23 and I'm finding

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
myself having the same cynicism

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
as people that are

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
much older than me because I'm just kind of going

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
that sounds like the person that made that single last year

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
but they're all different people but they all kind of look the same

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
and that's probably me just kind of being a bit of

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
a judgmental artist but I do

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
feel like it's becoming homogenous and you

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
can unless you play that game

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
it's like you've got the people that

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
really stand by you and the rest is kind of just a soup

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
I wish I had advice for kids your age

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
I kind of like I have this

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
urge to say to kids your age like I'm like

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
but I don't think this is good advice

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
but I have this urge to say to you guys

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
put your money into

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
infrastructure digitally

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
put your money into servers

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
put your money into creating your own antenna

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
don't rely on Google

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
and corporations that present you

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
with these platforms. Why do you think that's good advice?

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
That's really good advice. Well because the truth

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
is

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
Mickey Mouse was supposed to be public domain

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
a couple years ago and they fuck it

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
they'll change the rules on you as quick as can be

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
so I can't advise you

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
to go like you should

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
keep all your money in your mattress I can't tell

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
you that because they will make mattresses

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
we won't buy all the mattresses

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
they'll say that's federal that's

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
imminent domain like you're mad what you sleep

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
on that well

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
and then you'll be like Dan you told me to put

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
all my money in my mattress I'll be like sorry

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
no I get exactly I get it I get it

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
but what I want to say to you kids

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
is like defy

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
don't let these corporations trick

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
you by virtue of their access

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
they keep selling you kids

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
they keep going like hey it's

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
this app it's that app and like

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
you can do whatever you want

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
you can say whatever you want but you notice the news

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
is tightening like they

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
they always maintain

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
control they own everything that you

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
do I don't

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
know what to tell you though because

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
for you to like invest your money

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
in a fucking server

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
there's no recourse

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
if you have no money at all what if you're

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
exactly like I would never tell you like

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
seven dollars all of us have

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
like the best option

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
yeah can I give you some advice

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
plan your estate right now

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
it's never too early

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
my harm in turn subscription

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
well that'll

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
have you ever got anything pulled down

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
sorry have you ever you said

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
luckily well god yes

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
what happened is so to

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
try and catch the algorithm

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
I did covers of other people's

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
songs they were fine because

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
I didn't monetize them but youtube said

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
you're spamming which I wasn't

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
it was just regular like normal

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
posting and they

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
took away my monetization on my original videos

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
as well as all the rest of it

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
yeah but I don't make that much

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
money from it anyway I'm like basically

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
Obama I don't make any money

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
from my online stuff because

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
Obama

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
thanks Obama

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
I'm kidding but

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
but can I just

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
change tack pretty quickly because it's been in

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
my head literally for the whole

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
of this show

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
the whole not just this show but like the whole time

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
I've been listening to this show and this is going to sound

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
really out of the blue and I may be the only person thinking

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
this and I get to say this because I'm British

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
and I'm black

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
shit oh my god

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
let me make a couple predictions

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
cheers

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
I don't know

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
blood

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
it needs to be remarked that

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
and I may

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
just be speaking for myself I think you're too harsh on yourself

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
when you're talking about all of these issues

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
British and black people are telling me that

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
holy fuck

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
there is what we finally fucking figured out

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
that's like a vice

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
grip of self-esteem like

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
squeezing me right in the center

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
I'll be specific it's on issues

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
where you are like worried about

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
how

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
moral you are or how like

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
woke you are and I think sometimes

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
you worry too much you are not

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
on that side of the spectrum

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
just because

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
it's fancy to say that every

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
white guy is on that side of the spectrum

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
like you are surprisingly woke

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
for your circumstances

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
and we need

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
people like that on the team

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
hi

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
we need you on the team

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
yeah I'm not

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
secretly thinking to myself as I go home

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
god damn it I'm Joe Rogan again

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
like I know that I'm left

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
of everything productive

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
but that's

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
I think it's only fair for me to say

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
that Dan paid Omnia to come here

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
tonight

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
I wish I could use the one

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
no I'm kidding

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
to give her money to buy her server

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
which I would not know how to use but the reason I

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
say it is not because I think that you think

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
you're right of center but that I think

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
I mean again

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
if you listen to everything that Obama said this week

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
it makes sense in context

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
he was saying like it doesn't help

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
to kick people out the team that mean well

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
and y'all mean well

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
and so you're part of the team

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
and yeah every now and then we're going to go

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
okay that wasn't great

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
but it's better that

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
than oh Nazi like

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
you don't have to do all of that

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
sidelining all of the time it can be

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
a group effort and mood for it together

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
we don't perceive me as somebody who's like

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
I think I've been pretty vocal about the fact that

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
we need to definitely forgive the ignorant

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
yeah but I think that

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
the

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
I can't even remember what the specific context

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
was but at the time

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
there was a situation where you were kind

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
of worried that or maybe I misinterpreted

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
that you were worried that

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
all of these ignorant people

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
that are ignorant for the sake of being ignorant

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
they're not ignorant because they actually

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
want to learn are we forgive

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
all of them it's there is

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
a very small line and distinction

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
and I think because

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
maybe I'm online a bit more I see it more

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
that there are there's a difference

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
between forgiving everybody

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
that's ignorant and forgiving those that are

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
operating good faith

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
and so when you sympathize with the people

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
that aren't operating in good faith they're not

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
then not on the team but again I've taken

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
this in a completely political direction I didn't

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
right but I want to make sure you I mean

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
you

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
I totally agree with you

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
and like I do you think

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
because I feel like that's

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
that's the position that I'm in

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
like I'm like I gosh I wish

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
I wish that we weren't

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
so hard on each other

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
because by each other

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
I include like people

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
who are like they don't know if someone's

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
like five years off a

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
Twitter and they don't know that

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
they're supposed to say this instead of that

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
right dog pile them

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
like I find myself

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
saying the same thing

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
that a piece of shit might say

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
however

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
for the better reason which is like

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
guys we can't

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
tear each other apart

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
so like I don't know

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
this is British black girl stamp of approval in that opinion

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
just in case you needed it

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
but you probably didn't because Brandon also

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
is on this list

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
here's some advice you can give me as a British

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
black girl I think because

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
like I feel

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
as British

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
and black as a white

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
American can feel which is that

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
I feel like

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
I gotta

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
we'll be right back

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
this is blue apron

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
has a few words to say

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
I really do hope we

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
cut through me on this ad right there

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
in that I just feel like

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
I am so

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
and I cop to this where I'm like

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
I am so

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
unaccustomed to strife

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
and confusion that

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
I just like

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
I've bailed and that

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
like I think you could speak to

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
where you're like you're British

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
and you're black and you're a woman

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
like I think if you could probably

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
talk some sense into me because I'm like

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
this is fucking hard

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
when you're getting it from all sides

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
right because I feel like

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
if I advocate for

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
hey everybody should be allowed

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
to say whatever the fuck they want

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
it's like I just I always feel

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
caught in the middle of everything

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
I feel like

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
listen to you on any of that

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
like if you were to Francis tell me

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
grow the fuck up you're 46

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
like suck it up

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
I mean first of all anything that you're

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
feeling is valid because it's 2019

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
anything you're feeling is valid

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
you're not invited to the conversation

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
listen but no

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
what I was gonna say is like

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
it's down to kind of

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
you have to start from a place of

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
listen life

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
how how will we even hear

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
and you go into the full philosophical thing of

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
we're on this planet and we're only here

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
for a certain amount of time so

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
how are we gonna make this as good for everyone

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
as we can how are we gonna make

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
this as pleasant for everyone as we can and how are we

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
gonna be fair to everyone historically

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
and moving forward once you think of everything

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
in that macro sense this

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
micro stuff

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
contextualizes so if you're

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
feeling it like it's happening and it's coming

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
from all sides it's like really really intense

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
take a step back and think

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
of like the overall movement we're trying to

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
make you're advocating

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
for a thing that looks like long ago

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
in this podcast when I was going on tour I was

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
like we need a code we need an algorithm

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
we need a simple algorithm

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
that we can fall back

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
on in any situation of conflict where we go

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
wait wait a minute alright I'm getting my tempers

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
up my politics are getting in the way

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
all those micro stuff but like let me fall

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
back and go for instance

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
is there a human being hurt right now

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
yeah that kind of thing

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
we need a code

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
for instance the reason I find the green new deal

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
to be the best set of policies

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
that have been put together for

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
climate change is that it takes into account

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
historical ways of taking care

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
of the planet peoples that have been wronged

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
like all of that stuff needs to be

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
part of the conversation

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
while we move forward like everything has

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
to take in history everything has to take

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
in people that hurt now people hurt in the

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
past people hurt maybe even by things in

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
the future and I know it's a very happy to

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
be aware of doing things but I just feel like

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
if you come from a place of like

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
love for one another and also

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
just kind of

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
just acknowledging everybody and I think

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
it's tough to do when

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
people are refusing to do

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
the same thing it's tough to

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
stay very kind of

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
open heart and stuff for

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
people but as long as you're operating

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
from that on a macro scale

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
when the Nazis come out you know that

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
they are the Nazis

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
and we move together

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
right and I mean

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
I'm not sure how helpful that is

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
and you know who you are

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
they were clapping everybody

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
you're all Nazis you were clapping

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
because you love your name being mentioned

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
no that's very helpful

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
you said you don't know how helpful that is

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
it's incredibly helpful look you don't know how lost

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
I feel sometimes and I feel like I'm 46

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
and I don't suck my thumb about it anymore

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
that's part of my struggle too is like

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
you're 46 you're not allowed to suck your thumb

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
it's like I'm not allowed to be a baby anymore

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
that's not inspiring

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
like Garrison Keeler

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
he has an obligation

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
to be 85 years old

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
and go like

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
peep-bop-roo-bop-roo-bop-pie

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
like I can't

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
this podcast was found for me

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
can you explain to me who Garrison Keeler is

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
I don't know who Garrison Keeler is

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
ask your parents

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
hopefully one of your parents

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
is American I don't know

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
but it's an old guy

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
that did a show for a thousand years

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
and it was funny

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
in 1930 and then he

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
slowly turned thousand

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
and then he got me too to anyway

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
there is no guard against it

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
historical wrongs

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
there is no

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
I just don't want to be that guy

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
I started this

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
podcast from a standpoint of

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
the joy of going

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
baby I'm crying out

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
and the world has shifted

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
under my feet like it's not

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
it's not right and it's not charismatic

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
to be the baby

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
that I was five years ago

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
and that is a credit to the world that we live in

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
an absolute credit

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
do you think then that's part of the reason why this is going away

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
when you said I want this to stop

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
yes because I don't think that it is

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
appropriate to

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
go

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
it's hard to beat me I don't find that

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
it doesn't matter whether it's right or wrong

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
objectively I don't

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
feel right

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
doing it anymore

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
I don't like it it doesn't come out

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
of my throat with the

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
same beautiful

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
Hershey's syrupy

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
sweetness that it did when I was

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
35 is there a purpose to the show

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
aside from going wha wha wha

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
there could be something to it

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
I've tried going down that aisle in my mind

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
where I'm like let me signal boost

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
this socialist and this fucking charity

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
and all these things and it's kind of like fumbled

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
there's a socialist over there

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
I

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
I you know

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
thank you for coming Bernie

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
I think there's a million versions

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
I just you know I need to hit the bench

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
and think about it

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
also we thought this show I never thought this show

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
was going to go longer than like a couple weeks

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
it's been amazing

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
the fact that I just wouldn't die

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
and went on for how many years

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
seven years

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
like it's like it nothing has to

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
last forever and it's

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
like

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
but whatever

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
it becomes afterwards will be something else

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
I think it's an amazing thing to say

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
there's a new show I'm pitching called Omnia Town

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
where Omnia is the host of the show

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
the population of the public

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
I mean because we're all trying to do everything

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
I also already have a podcast

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
no one listens to it but I have a podcast

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
what is your podcast you want to plug it real quick

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
I'm sure it's called Nerd U

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
I just review like movie stuff and TV stuff

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
and nerd U

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
I just covered I'm about to cover

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
I went to London Film Festival

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
and watched a bunch of movies in advance

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
everyone go see JoJo Rabbit

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
everyone go see JoJo Rabbit

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
Omnia would it be too much

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
of an onus on you to put

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
like Dan you got your little musical thing

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
over there and we got beats up there

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
can you do some of your music

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
and maybe Dan like adds into it

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
we'll put that shit on

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
YouTube and we'll fucking boost that shit like crazy

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
okay

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
I mean Dan could rap

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
and then you could do the break

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
okay also

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
and before that do you want to shout out

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
I can't believe this

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
she's wearing a very dazzling outfit

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
that accent coming from the audience

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
she shouted at clearly

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
I was like one of your tracks

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
it's one of my songs

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
it's like

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
my American

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
instinct was like mom shut up

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
and I was like god damn if my mom was James Bond

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
I'm fine with it

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
Omnia what is your name

I don't think this is working

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
Schrab doesn't need a mic

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
my voice carries

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
that one doesn't work

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
I'll take this one

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
Sarah how do you feel about

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
first of all

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
what your life is

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
are you still living in Cambridge

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
we live in Cambridge

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
I am the amazingly gifted

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
mom

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
sorry you can tell I don't do this

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
not from the jacket

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
pretty sure it feels like you just came from

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
three different shows

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
reader

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
how can you tell Dan

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
you are fantastic

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
but no I'm blessed with two amazing girls

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
Omnia is my eldest

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
she's our

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
musician and actress

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
and she's insanely talented

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
and the song that I shouted out

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
well she has a few that are amazing

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
but that particular one

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
is really good

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
are you a musician too Sarah

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
does that mean she is

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
she is the most

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
amazing jazz singer

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
oh my god

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
and it's where I get it from

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
that's not what I do for a living

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
but you have that gift in you

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
yes

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
this is complicated

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
I'd love to say it's a gift

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
I would just say it's a thing

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
it's always been a thing

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
it's like Marvel movie shit

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
I've never pursued that

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
you've never been show busy

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
I've done gigs I've worked with bands

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
but it's not my day job

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
so you are a showbiz

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
just a little

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
it's like John Wick crazy shit

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
like you're like oh my

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
it's not for me I raise a daughter

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
and there's like buried under concrete

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
it's like a microphone and a

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
stand up bass and she has to like

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
chisel it open and it's like

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
but it's because there is no time

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
because my full

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
my daytime job is a doctor

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
so there is no time

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
you're a superhero

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
you're like I could have been a jazz musician

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
but I had to be a doctor

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
not just any old doctor

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
she's a pediatrician

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
she takes care of kids

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
now

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
Umnia

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
did your musical

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
is that a chip off her block

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
oh god yes I mean

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
you grow up with someone that loves music

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
and you're gonna yeah

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
what was the music that you played

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
Sarah what was the music that Umnia

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
grew up around like what did you play

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
she grew up with Prince number one

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
yeah you love to see it

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
so Prince when they were little

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
I mean like really little

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
can you imagine like Prince

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
even when they needed to like nobody was going to go to sleep

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
and everybody was six would be in the car

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
or when they would be sick tiny little babies

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
in their in their sort of seats

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
and would be blaring Prince up and down the highway

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
even the dirty stuff

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
yeah

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
his lyrics are pretty frisky

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
darling Nicky

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
that early frisky stuff

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
you don't understand when your four months old

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
you don't right so it was okay

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
so windows would be down

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
sunroof down and we'd just fly

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
on sort of the little country roads

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
in Cambridge trying to get a baby to sleep

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
with Prince on and it worked

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
and it worked

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
what's your vocal range like who do you

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
where would your vocal quality fall

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
like who's a like

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
Diana Washington

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
no way because she's the greatest

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
well thank you thank you

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
not but I try

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
just like what's a good Diana Washington song

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
I

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
what a difference is Diana

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
anytime we have a date

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
but I love him

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
yes it's

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
that's Louis Jordan

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
but Diana is a good job with that

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
that's the song I grew up on and she used to sing at her gigs

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
and relax max you is

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
a man is a creature

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
that has always been

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
strange just when you're sure

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
you'll find he's gone

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
and made a change

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
hey

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
coming round the bend

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
don't want them

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
babies

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
coming out of me

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
everybody's

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
babies

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
are gonna be free

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
only three shows left everybody

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
only three shows

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
I'm gonna miss this show so much

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
I'm sorry

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
I'm so confused

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
you said you were having confidence problems

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
this year and you do not

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
strike me as an unconfident person

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
something about this show

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
feels like home I've been having a really rough year

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
but you know

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
both of you

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
identical

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
from where I'm sitting you're so beautifully the same

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
mother and daughter is beautiful

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
and also I feel like there are certain people

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
that are born with microphones in their hand

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
and I think you're probably more confident

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
if you have a vehicle

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
and Sarah for sure

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
and me

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
you hold

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
and I

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
grew older and replaced

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
a mic with a drink

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
alright

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
it's not about me

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
but the fact like holding a microphone

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
when you have a voice like that

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
it must be fun just to let that out

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
that's why showers were built

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
so you can sing in them and the acoustics

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
and the other thing

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
yeah I mean

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
yeah

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
I don't even use the water I just sing

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
just get in there the acoustics

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
do you often sing together

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
like around the house

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
around the house yes

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
yes we do

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
because we're all quite close as a family

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
so we tend to finish off each other's sentences

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
and we do that

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
yeah

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
that was good fun though

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
and we'll do that with songs

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
so somebody will walk into the room singing

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
a phrase and we'll just pick it up

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
for example

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
what's your favorite

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
what's your favorite print song

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
like if you walk around the house

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
and you wanted to just pipe up on a print song

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
well it depends whether I want to sing it

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
or whether I want to hear it

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
Thundar is one of my favorites

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
I love diamonds and pearls

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
you know

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
his late diamonds and pearls

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000

so hush

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
of these mornings

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
and you're gonna spread

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
your wings

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
and you're gonna

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
play to the sky

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
I

thank you

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
morning

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
I

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
miss something

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
I'm so sorry for my audience

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
I'm sorry

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
the white people are counting on one and three

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
and that fucks the whole thing up

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
one of these mornings

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
you're gonna

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
wake up smiling

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
I'll try and guide you

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
and you'll spread your wings

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
and

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
you'll take to

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
the sky

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
but till that morning

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
there ain't nothing can harm you

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
with mommy

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
and daddy

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
standing by

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
standing by

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
yeah

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
summertime

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
you have no idea how happy that makes me

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
you have no idea how happy this makes me

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
I haven't sang with mom jazz

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
for so long

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
how happy does it make you

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
but

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
this mom like

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
I don't have this kind of relationship

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
with like I don't get this as

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
mom do you think you kind of

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
bury your

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
are you a PhD

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
I'm an MD

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
is that better than a PhD

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
she has a PhD

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
which allows her to be an MD

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
a PhD means you aren't a doctor

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
and an MD means you are a doctor

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
yeah

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
PhD is like an ornamental

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
so

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
there's no shade

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
fuck you PhD

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
there's no shade

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
Sarah said it first

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
it's doctor ret

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
it's just the terminology

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
so when you become an MD

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
you become a doctor

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
which is like a clinician doctor

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
and then if you want to do some extra research

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
whether you are already an MD

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
or whether you're anyone else

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
who does sort of extra super research

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
then you become a PhD doctor doctor

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
if you're a PhD and an MD

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
then you're a double doctor

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
but in any case is singing

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
like a thing that you

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
what's the relationship between you

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
and your daughter and singing

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
are you known as the singing doctor

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
wouldn't that be great

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
no

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
are you sort of like

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
a patient called her Mary Poppins though

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
she has a big doctor bag

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
and she had this hat that used to collapse

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
so she was like proper Mary Poppins

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
are you

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
a person that went through a lot of hardship

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
and you're like man

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
if singing was a thing that could

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
support a family then god damn it

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
I'd do it but actually

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
I think I'll use

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
my brain and I gotta raise my daughter up

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
and then your daughter has a proclivity

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
for that and you're like go girl

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
go

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
but she's looking at you and going

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
why didn't you go girl go

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
and you're like

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
go girl go

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
do you know

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
well in a way

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
you kind of read me

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
but not a hundred percent

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
so my family

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
my father was also a doctor

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
but very traditional

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
so this idea of doing anything

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
but medicine was like

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
oh no

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
and so even though my mother was musical

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
and I was musical

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
there was no way that was gonna happen

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
but it did because you know

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
when you're a teenager you don't listen to anybody

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
and so it did

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
and it even did after I graduated

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
but they weren't ever part of that part of me

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
and so when

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
this little one at the age of three months

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
was literally

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
mimicking my singing

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
so I'd be vacuuming around her cot

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
and she'd be singing

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
she'd be humming

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
what I was singing

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
and my husband would say

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
you know the child is singing

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
and so that happened

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
from the age of kind of three months

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
onwards and so when she said

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
that was what I want to do

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
I said you go girl

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
Sarah

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
oh yeah sorry

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
I'm a lucky kid I'm a lucky kid

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
not everybody knows how to do that

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
how old was Zomnia when

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
you guys could harmonize together

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
was that something she had to learn

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
that was just an innate skill

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
and it just turned out one day

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
literally turned out one day so I'd be singing

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
and suddenly I heard this

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
incredible harmonic

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
sort of response

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
and she's been like that ever since

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
and I think I developed it later

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
so as I sang jazz

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
it was when I sort of hit my mid 40s

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
that I could riff or I could

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
improvise this child

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
has been doing it since she was

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
pretty much vocal

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
but really harmonizing no big deal

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
like

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
Jeff like give me a note

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
I'll harmonize with it

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
who

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
that's a scale somewhere

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
some scale

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
some scale has that in it

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
I'm going to

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
a walk up

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
I'm going to graduate a little bit

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
I'm going to go

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
and this is

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
the

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
and

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
and

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
he's got it

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
I mean it's really no big deal

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
I don't mean to take anything away from

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
your relationship but honestly

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
harmony

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
if Harmontown doesn't need service at all

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
it's 2G mystify innate

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
challenge

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
I've never

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
understood harmony for real though

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
I've never gotten that

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
the idea of harmonizing I don't get that

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
there's all these

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
notes and then there's notes that fit together nicely

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
there's notes that fit together poorly

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
by all of these you mean 8

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
there's 12

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
there's 12 on it

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
there's 13

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
there's like a 1 3 5

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
like a 1

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000

Just a nice, easy, just saying nice, soft, single tone.

01:10:40.420 --> 01:10:43.540
Is there any guidance when he lays a down, harmonized?

01:10:43.540 --> 01:10:44.540
You gotta harmonize.

01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:02.360

I don't wanna fuck up these guys.

01:11:03.500 --> 01:11:05.860
Dan, Dan, he could sing his name.

01:11:05.860 --> 01:11:07.700
Then it'll be easier to hold the note.

01:11:07.700 --> 01:11:08.540
Yeah.

01:11:08.540 --> 01:11:09.380

Hi.

01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:13.380

thing it's like oh I know that yeah I know myself yeah oh my god that's like

01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:55.680
people that say they can't sing I'm a firm believer in a friend of mine

01:11:55.680 --> 01:12:00.920
Michael Pollock taught me or like I grew up musically and like I could always

01:12:00.920 --> 01:12:05.200
sing and I grew up in a very musical family kind of in a he said everybody

01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:08.440
can sing but people have been talked out of singing at a young age yes people

01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:12.920
that say I can't sing some asshole relative yes told you at a birthday party

01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:17.620
that you should not sing correct or your auntie or your grandma it's called

01:12:17.620 --> 01:12:22.100
sing shaming yeah but everybody everybody can sing happy birthday

01:12:22.100 --> 01:12:26.500
everybody can whistle maybe you have some like the thing with your mouth that

01:12:26.500 --> 01:12:30.860
you can't but like but people going happy birthday everybody can do it yeah

01:12:30.860 --> 01:12:36.080
and you've been talked out of singing and talked out of the fact that we can all

01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:41.060
share a tune yeah and I think that's so cool to grow up in a family like my

01:12:41.060 --> 01:12:44.560
mother thought she couldn't sing my dad was just too stoic and didn't really

01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:48.440
sing but like they put me in the theater and stuff like that so I was always

01:12:48.440 --> 01:12:52.240
around like musical people yeah but when they would leave the house I would put

01:12:52.240 --> 01:12:58.880
on Duke Ellington records and Sinatra and Gershwin and Nat King Cole and I

01:12:58.880 --> 01:13:02.280
would just like I thought it'd be important one day to know all that stuff

01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:16.440
and you know why Jeff because it's important to oh it's important you

01:13:16.440 --> 01:13:26.320
guys we open in three nights hey hey hey I I did I did interrupt right now but

01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:34.480
I'm interrupting with the microphone coming down

01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:45.560
45 degrees Spencer that's not a note it's a no it's a note I'm not okay

01:13:45.560 --> 01:13:51.000
Spencer might be the like Spencer it's funny that's not an easy one you want

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:55.040
to one syllable open vowel sounds Spencer's a little difficult my mom said

01:13:55.040 --> 01:14:08.720
everyone could sing or dance but no one could do both and I think that's true I

01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:14.920
think that bears out yeah I take that front of stare

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:22.720
could she do either Spencer yeah yeah which one she could sing okay but not

01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:28.560
dance no she was she took the world with her she did learn how to dance yeah

01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:35.740
yeah we're kind of dance like ballroom yeah ballroom swing sir what let's all

01:14:35.740 --> 01:14:41.040
these men let's all harmonize well how about this okay how about this let's do

01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:44.280
this here's an experiment this might be a total disaster

01:14:44.280 --> 01:14:52.080
umnia and Sarah to start you umnia you go Sarah you go and then the audience

01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:56.820

01:15:41.280 --> 01:15:45.400
a Spencer out of the sexy six on top of that but that's the beauty is like

01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:50.040
almost every like 95% of you all sing the fifth note on that like that's just

01:15:50.040 --> 01:15:54.840
logical yes I think it's human I think we all yeah I think I think it's part of

01:15:54.840 --> 01:15:59.640
I think we all can move to a beat no matter how melon deficient we may be I

01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:05.680
think we can all sing to that give us a beat let's go everybody lay a beat on a

01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:25.400
let's see if we can put this to music yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah Spencer yeah

01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:33.040
yeah Spencer yeah my name is mr. rap and I'm here to say I'd like to rap all day

01:16:40.720 --> 01:16:49.080
I'd like to rap till the beat expires then I'll defeat the rap itself and then

01:16:49.080 --> 01:16:56.160

chance to let me do the rap that frames them so you can play one of your like

01:24:43.600 --> 01:25:02.240

01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:18.640
how dare you lady with your space jacket I don't think that you're singing

01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:48.360
can even hack it you I don't believe that you can

01:25:48.360 --> 01:26:02.760
sing it I'm gonna do it instead it's another thing

01:26:02.760 --> 01:26:21.000
I was going to say I was going to say that I'm gonna give up whether you want to or not you gotta gotta talk back cuz I don't know how to rap

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:36.800
but you can sing so that's another thing and here I'm gonna put out my dingle thing and here here it is one two three four and then go into four I don't know I mean I mean like what does it take to get you to sing

01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:54.440
my love and my love is like a song

01:26:54.440 --> 01:27:01.440
my love is like a song

01:27:01.440 --> 01:27:08.440
what's a good thing

01:27:08.440 --> 01:27:37.440
then that's God she'll get well then that's not she'll lose so the Bible says and it's still is new your mama may have and your papa may have but God bless the child that's got his own

01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:45.440
that's got his own

01:27:45.440 --> 01:27:51.440
all right we coached her now mama why don't you take us seven years to perfect Harmontown

01:27:51.440 --> 01:28:07.400
no no no amount of no amount of academia can can can bury the musician in you thank you thank you well can I can I just say it's a shame I mean like an enormous shame that this is ending I'm so

01:28:07.400 --> 01:28:22.400
hoping that you do lots of other things because when we first really got to know about you down it was with community actually my kids came and said you've gotta come and watch this mom because it's so meta it's got all

01:28:22.400 --> 01:28:49.400
these different levels of psychic thinking and and this man is insanely brilliant and it's layers upon layers and it's the most intelligent thing and they were right and then and then we watch these crazy episodes and then you did one with stop motion and then you did one with different timelines and you just go whose brain is this

01:28:49.400 --> 01:29:07.400
and then you did the one with the markets zero and no but but but but I but I think but I but I think I think zero Emmys has more about them than you because right right

01:29:07.400 --> 01:29:25.400
you want to talk about meta he did a season where he wasn't even on the show can I just say I didn't watch it to this day I still haven't watched it and protest I was I was so angry but it but then you knew we knew that

01:29:25.400 --> 01:29:43.400
I mean it tanked that season and my girls out of and out of protest they really did they refused to watch it and so I think I think that I think that it's it's if people like you exist and the way that you write exists you've got to be out there doing a lot more

01:29:43.400 --> 01:30:03.400
yeah you got it I would say you might not be familiar with his morning workouts I am I am you are I am now it's getting freaky well my daughters my daughters follow him so so I know quite a bit about about what else is going on but yeah no he

01:30:03.400 --> 01:30:18.400
needs to be doing more he really does can I can we expatriate you to to the states and you just keep you here in California do you know we were thinking of getting a place here that's true yeah yeah is it hard to to emigrate

01:30:18.400 --> 01:30:38.400
it's hard for me because of course I've got all my patients back in the UK generally yes I think so you'll find out as long as you have a shithole country before we move forward can I just say Jeff I didn't know that on my bucket list was hearing you sing with my mom

01:30:38.400 --> 01:30:48.400
haha like anyway this is that I'm gonna wake up my favorite moments of my life I've been singing with strangers or people I've just met like I love to sing along more than anything

01:32:22.400 --> 01:32:29.400
he's at Sunday school no no no no no no no no no no no no he's the first Republican I've ever loved

01:32:29.400 --> 01:32:42.400
whoa no no not it chief no you feel let down by him yes like yes yes it's usually a British perspective on Kanye

01:32:42.400 --> 01:32:48.400
painful and what the British perspective on Kanye is basically well I mean the British black perspective on Kanye

01:32:48.400 --> 01:32:53.400
is basically the black perspective on Kanye like we loved you during Katrina

01:32:53.400 --> 01:33:05.400
we we we kind of feel that he's flown the coupe a bit and we're like what's going on how could you not when you get the power to build your own geodesic domes

01:33:05.400 --> 01:33:14.400
yeah he's just like what do I do to rebel against myself yeah no but obviously he's become a Ralph Bakshi cartoon

01:33:14.400 --> 01:33:27.400
but from the story of everyone I know now I like meet these icons and I'm like god damn it can we all fuck on you yeah oh yeah I'm at Kanye

01:33:27.400 --> 01:33:34.400
they're good friends you know I thought that was like a known thing he came to the Rick and Morty office he was fucking cool man

01:33:34.400 --> 01:33:46.400
is he gonna be on the show they made an episode together is that a secret I talked to him for like two and a half hours

01:33:46.400 --> 01:33:59.400
I found him to be truly like I didn't he steal Rob's hoodie he threw Rob's hoodie in the garbage we didn't talk about this

01:33:59.400 --> 01:34:08.400
like Kanye came in because it Kanye has like this thing he's like the most I told that none of you will believe it

01:34:08.400 --> 01:34:14.400
Kanye had this hoodie and he's like the hoodies the most important article of clothing in the history of America or whatever

01:34:14.400 --> 01:34:23.400
and to his point he's like he's saying like because it's like poor people can buy a hoodie rich people want a hoodie whatever that was his thing

01:34:23.400 --> 01:34:31.400
and then he was like he they had this big thick hoodie on and then he kept he's like pointing he's pointing at Schrab and he's like

01:34:31.400 --> 01:34:40.400
like that hoodie what's the deal and Schrab at this fucking shitty like sweatshirt that he and Kanye put it on and was like

01:34:40.400 --> 01:34:45.400
see what the fuck is this no I didn't put it out he didn't put it on right away and he looked at the tag and he was like

01:34:45.400 --> 01:34:55.400
H.N.M. and he was like Boop Wildered by it's like H.N.M. and then we lost track of it for a while and an hour later

01:34:55.400 --> 01:35:05.400
we're like where's Schrab's hoodie it was in the garbage Kanye West threw Rob's hoodie in the fucking garbage

01:35:05.400 --> 01:35:13.400
like it was a dirty Kleenex he found on the coffee table and it wasn't a bit like like I'll be the first guy to tell you like

01:35:13.400 --> 01:35:19.400
Kanye West has a he's an intelligent guy with a huge like like he's capable of having a sense of humor about himself

01:35:19.400 --> 01:35:26.400
we talked a bunch about how it would be funny you could change my mind about him because the only reason I don't feel heavy about

01:35:26.400 --> 01:35:31.400
Kanye is because I haven't talked to Kanye about what the hell's going on and I never will because I'm a pleb

01:35:31.400 --> 01:35:38.400
he's super charismatic and like there's absolutely nobody that's gonna like everything you've seen about him is curated through

01:35:38.400 --> 01:35:45.400
and if you wear the wrong hoodie that's in the fucking trash can but that was crazy recycle bin which was like

01:35:45.400 --> 01:35:54.400
Rob's hoodie was in the trash can and we were all like Rob's hoodies in the trash can and Kanye was like

01:35:54.400 --> 01:36:01.400
he didn't he didn't own it like it was like it was like did he have somebody else around or he actually said this

01:36:01.400 --> 01:36:09.400
this isn't even clothing to me so this belongs to Rob's hoodie in the garbage can he didn't even care that you saw it

01:36:09.400 --> 01:36:14.400
because no one saw it until it was already in the garbage can he wore it for a while because he like wore it for a while

01:36:14.400 --> 01:36:19.400
and he was like well he actually tried his on to prove a point yeah he was wearing Schrabs hoodie for a while and he was like

01:36:19.400 --> 01:36:26.400
man I look built in this like because Schrabs hoodie was smaller but then it disappeared after a while and it was just gone

01:36:26.400 --> 01:36:34.400
and then we were like where's Schrabs hoodie it's in the garbage and they were like Kanye did you throw Rob's hoodie in the garbage

01:36:34.400 --> 01:36:38.400
Kanye was, did you throw Rob's hoodie in the garbage?

01:36:38.400 --> 01:36:44.400
and he wouldn't he would like if he had done it as a joke he would have been like ha ha he was like huh

01:36:44.400 --> 01:36:51.400
and that's when I knew like that guy is fucking play on top of the world or he was like he actually

01:36:51.400 --> 01:36:56.400
when he was realizing that moment he's like yeah it probably did

01:36:56.400 --> 01:36:58.400
but actually I shouldn't have

01:36:58.400 --> 01:37:04.400
when you mind him being on the phone while you asked him that was he ordering Schrab and new Kanye hoodie?

01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:06.400
no we were in a room together

01:37:06.400 --> 01:37:12.400
like I'm saying the wastebasket was next to him and he was like on his phone and he was like huh

01:37:12.400 --> 01:37:15.400
but there was no contrition no acknowledgement of the crime

01:37:15.400 --> 01:37:22.400
he was like he was he kind of like we were like Kanye did you throw Rob's Schrabs hoodie in the garbage can

01:37:22.400 --> 01:37:30.400
with all of the garbage and he was like including all his entourage like he had these cool dudes with him

01:37:30.400 --> 01:37:35.400
like I will also say that like Kanye's got like fucking cool dudes around him like

01:37:35.400 --> 01:37:36.400
how cool

01:37:36.400 --> 01:37:44.400
fucking two two cool two really cool dudes who like have been hanging out with him forever like super cool dudes

01:37:44.400 --> 01:37:49.400
like and then like one dude one dude who scared the shit out of me

01:37:49.400 --> 01:37:51.400
that's the security

01:37:51.400 --> 01:37:58.400
like a fuck yeah like this crazy white dude in fucking Kev like like like fucking paramilitary gear

01:37:58.400 --> 01:38:04.400
who like I didn't notice until I went to the bathroom outside the writer's room and then I was like huh

01:38:04.400 --> 01:38:08.400
okay and the guy was like huh

01:38:08.400 --> 01:38:12.400
his job was he had one job just to make sure

01:38:12.400 --> 01:38:19.400
I'm gonna say he has two jobs one is when Kanye hands off a hoodie his job is to dispose of the hoodie

01:38:19.400 --> 01:38:23.400
that guy had nothing to do with any of the chat like that guy's job was to fucking like as soon as he

01:38:23.400 --> 01:38:28.400
he checked the perimeter of the writer's room like his head ducked in and he was like looking around

01:38:28.400 --> 01:38:32.400
he's like what what's going on what's this room that Kanye's going into

01:38:32.400 --> 01:38:36.400
and then he fucking stood post outside the writer's room and he was out there

01:38:36.400 --> 01:38:42.400
I went to pee and I made the huge mistake of like I was like I came back from peeing

01:38:42.400 --> 01:38:47.400
and I was like I made some joke or something like thanks for letting me pee

01:38:47.400 --> 01:38:52.400
like nothing stupid and he just steered through me like a terminator

01:38:52.400 --> 01:38:58.400
and I was like holy shit he will kill me like if I make the slightest wrong move

01:38:58.400 --> 01:39:02.400
his job is to keep anyone from getting in this room and killing Kanye

01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:06.400
his boss is a motherfucking monster

01:39:06.400 --> 01:39:09.400
no he's not a monster don't don't I won't let it

01:39:09.400 --> 01:39:12.400
I've defended Kanye from the fucking moment

01:39:12.400 --> 01:39:15.400
no it's a lyric from a song then don't don't don't get offended

01:39:15.400 --> 01:39:16.400
can I

01:39:16.400 --> 01:39:18.400
he's not a monster he's not a monster

01:39:18.400 --> 01:39:23.400
can I can I poke holes in his logic if his idea is that oh hoodies that for everybody

01:39:23.400 --> 01:39:27.400
and that even the people who can't afford very good hoodies can wear hoodies

01:39:27.400 --> 01:39:30.400
why did he throw rubs in the trash

01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:34.400
I don't think he knew he threw rubs in the trash

01:39:34.400 --> 01:39:36.400
oh it was just like a reflex

01:39:36.400 --> 01:39:38.400
he was cleaning up

01:39:38.400 --> 01:39:42.400
I truly think that consciously in his mind he thought he was throwing it in the diaper

01:39:42.400 --> 01:39:47.400
can I extend Kanye some meaningless benefits of meaningless doubts

01:39:47.400 --> 01:39:50.400
he tried on Rob Schrab's hoodie

01:39:50.400 --> 01:39:52.400
it was a little too small for him

01:39:52.400 --> 01:39:55.400
he felt a little flexed up and he goes you know what

01:39:55.400 --> 01:39:59.400
I didn't take a shower today or I put on too much cologne today

01:39:59.400 --> 01:40:01.400
I can't give this back to him

01:40:01.400 --> 01:40:03.400
he's gonna like

01:40:03.400 --> 01:40:07.400
I spilled some chili on it

01:40:07.400 --> 01:40:09.400
he liked it

01:40:09.400 --> 01:40:11.400
and he fucking loved Schrab

01:40:11.400 --> 01:40:13.400
like Kanye was fixated on Schrab

01:40:15.400 --> 01:40:17.400
like he loved Schrab

01:40:17.400 --> 01:40:19.400
okay so he has good taste

01:40:19.400 --> 01:40:21.400
and then he left

01:40:21.400 --> 01:40:23.400
and I won't let anybody talk shit

01:40:23.400 --> 01:40:26.400
wasn't there a dissertation on why one hoodie was better than the other

01:40:26.400 --> 01:40:29.400
like he laid them out on the table

01:40:29.400 --> 01:40:31.400
Elon and I won't let people talk shit about him either

01:40:31.400 --> 01:40:33.400
and Kanye won't let people talk shit about Elon

01:40:33.400 --> 01:40:35.400
and probably won't talk shit about Elon

01:40:35.400 --> 01:40:37.400
but because Kanye was like

01:40:37.400 --> 01:40:39.400
his favorite movie is The Aviator

01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:41.400
and I'm like me too, me too

01:40:41.400 --> 01:40:43.400
show me all the blueprints

01:40:43.400 --> 01:40:45.400
let's all look at all the blueprints

01:40:48.400 --> 01:40:52.400
don't you have security cameras at the Rick and Morty writers room

01:40:52.400 --> 01:40:55.400
I want to know exactly what happened to Rob's hoodie

01:40:55.400 --> 01:40:57.400
he threw in the fucking garbage

01:40:57.400 --> 01:40:59.400
what are we telling you

01:40:59.400 --> 01:41:01.400
like Kanye would be here

01:41:01.400 --> 01:41:03.400
and he'd go yeah I threw Rob's hoodie in the garbage

01:41:03.400 --> 01:41:05.400
because it was

01:41:05.400 --> 01:41:07.400
because he didn't want it anymore

01:41:07.400 --> 01:41:09.400
for a second he was like this is garbage

01:41:09.400 --> 01:41:11.400
that was his whole point

01:41:11.400 --> 01:41:15.400
what a privilege to be able to just work on your impulses

01:41:15.400 --> 01:41:18.400
he's married to Kim Kardashian

01:41:18.400 --> 01:41:21.400
he's got all the privileges

01:41:21.400 --> 01:41:23.400
he's got Kanye West privileges

01:41:23.400 --> 01:41:25.400
and to his point the U.S. press

01:41:25.400 --> 01:41:27.400
has been totally

01:41:27.400 --> 01:41:29.400
they never said

01:41:29.400 --> 01:41:33.400
hey, Kanye is a fucking billionaire

01:41:33.400 --> 01:41:35.400
they'll celebrate a Kardashian

01:41:35.400 --> 01:41:37.400
before him

01:41:37.400 --> 01:41:39.400
you know

01:41:39.400 --> 01:41:41.400
I get his fucking

01:41:41.400 --> 01:41:43.400
whatever

01:41:43.400 --> 01:41:46.400
I got the shtick while it was a shtick that some people didn't like

01:41:46.400 --> 01:41:48.400
I think this bent towards

01:41:48.400 --> 01:41:51.400
republicanism is a bit weird

01:41:51.400 --> 01:41:53.400
because he was like

01:41:53.400 --> 01:41:55.400
George Bush doesn't care about black people

01:41:55.400 --> 01:41:57.400
we like that guy

01:41:57.400 --> 01:41:59.400
Trump is crazy for black people

01:42:01.400 --> 01:42:03.400
Trump loves his black people

01:42:03.400 --> 01:42:05.400
truly I don't even come from a position

01:42:05.400 --> 01:42:07.400
of like I've kind of almost gone to the point where I just

01:42:07.400 --> 01:42:09.400
don't pay attention to what he does

01:42:09.400 --> 01:42:11.400
because I'm confused

01:42:11.400 --> 01:42:13.400
you don't want to put your eggs in that basket

01:42:13.400 --> 01:42:15.400
and you shouldn't

01:42:15.400 --> 01:42:17.400
I've got a friend who knows that he's like

01:42:17.400 --> 01:42:19.400
kooky and does his weird stuff

01:42:19.400 --> 01:42:21.400
and he's like the new record's really good

01:42:21.400 --> 01:42:23.400
and he goes I listen to it 10 times a day

01:42:23.400 --> 01:42:25.400
so that makes it 12 platinum albums

01:42:25.400 --> 01:42:27.400
like how many fucking platinum albums

01:42:27.400 --> 01:42:29.400
does a guy have to do

01:42:29.400 --> 01:42:31.400
before you go like whatever you say is fucking

01:42:31.400 --> 01:42:33.400
I can't do whatever you say

01:42:33.400 --> 01:42:35.400
no matter how many platinum albums you go up my dude

01:42:35.400 --> 01:42:37.400
but if he was white

01:42:37.400 --> 01:42:39.400
if he was white

01:42:39.400 --> 01:42:41.400
there are white people

01:42:41.400 --> 01:42:43.400
that have done really great things

01:42:43.400 --> 01:42:45.400
who have done stuff that I don't agree with

01:42:45.400 --> 01:42:47.400
that I still don't kind of support

01:42:47.400 --> 01:42:49.400
platinum albums

01:42:49.400 --> 01:42:50.400
well

01:42:50.400 --> 01:42:52.400
Umni if you're going to make it in this music industry

01:42:52.400 --> 01:42:54.400
you're going to have to drop some of that fucking integrity

01:42:56.400 --> 01:42:58.400
cliffhanger

01:42:58.400 --> 01:43:00.400
thank you all

01:43:00.400 --> 01:43:02.400
can we please give it up

01:43:02.400 --> 01:43:04.400
for maybe my favorite guest of all time

01:43:04.400 --> 01:43:06.400
Sarah

01:43:06.400 --> 01:43:08.400
and Umnia

01:43:08.400 --> 01:43:11.400
Umnia

01:43:16.400 --> 01:43:18.400
Safetravels back across the pond

01:43:18.400 --> 01:43:20.400
Rob Schrab, everybody

you can check that out, you can find it on YouTube

01:43:28.400 --> 01:43:30.400
I'm sure it's going to be quite easy

01:43:30.400 --> 01:43:32.400
Lets give it up for Spencer Quintenden

01:43:35.400 --> 01:43:37.400
Zack McKeever on the music

01:43:37.400 --> 01:43:39.860
Sean, the photos, Nolan on the everythings,

01:43:39.860 --> 01:43:42.640
everybody here at the Dynasty typewriter.

01:43:42.640 --> 01:43:44.280
I'm your mayor, no I'm not.

01:43:44.280 --> 01:43:46.360
I'm your fucking com-troller.

01:43:46.360 --> 01:43:47.840
Maybe one day I will be.

01:43:47.840 --> 01:43:50.120
Only 17 more shows to go.

01:43:50.120 --> 01:43:51.560
I'm Jeff Davis.

01:43:51.560 --> 01:43:54.000
Let's give it up for your mayor, Dan Harmon, everybody.

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:57.480
["Give a One Metta One Heart"]

01:43:57.480 --> 01:44:00.560
One more time for Sarah and Numnia, or the treat.

01:44:00.560 --> 01:44:03.000
["Give a One Metta One Heart"]

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000
Thank y'all.

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:06.200
Zach, throw some beats on.

01:44:06.200 --> 01:44:08.200
Drive fast and take chances, y'all.

01:44:08.200 --> 01:44:10.200
["Give a One Metta One Heart"]

01:44:10.200 --> 01:44:16.200
["Give a One Metta One Heart"]

01:44:16.200 --> 01:44:25.200
["Give a One Metta One Heart"]

01:44:25.200 --> 01:44:27.200
Did you get any of that?

01:44:27.200 --> 01:44:37.200
It's a good show.
