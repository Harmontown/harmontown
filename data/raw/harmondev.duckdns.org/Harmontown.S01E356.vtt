came out poor cat all right look how does a cat end up on a football field so how does a cat end up on a football there's no fucking cat who brings a cat to a game there's a\n\n04:21.000 --> 04:48.000\ngood idea all right packer fan I would guess the bangles so a cat's on a football field oh I'm sorry do you do you want my input I relate for the war syllables yeah well just this is not your you've sacrificed your your titular duties\n\n04:48.000 --> 05:08.000\nyou've sacrificed your tits well careful what you wish for what so what did the cat do Dan what happened to the cat the cat walked no nothing no reaction to the word walked you guys don't have a funny\n\n05:08.000 --> 05:31.000\nreaction to the word walked the cat walked on it walked on it walked on guys come on react I would you didn't it didn't walk in the cat walked on the the football field\n\n05:31.000 --> 05:51.000\nI don't believe tell us your cat story Dan so it's American this is gonna be great how great\n\n05:51.000 --> 06:05.000\nokay let's back it up why were you watching football in the first place you're not I don't think he was you're not a sporty it's just it's a TV like what is in a bar these days except mirrors and TVs like there was a thing and there was a cat on the TV\n\n06:05.000 --> 06:24.000\nso the cats like walking across the field and there's like everyone's cheering and there's it's this black cat and I'm thinking like I don't think that that cat lives in a football arena it was very fat they were showing like close ups of the cat I had like a double chin\n\n06:24.000 --> 06:43.000\nand like okay I bet a football fan because we know like and I respect the athletes they're very superstitious people I get that when you push yourself to the physical limits like you're gonna be superstitious I don't look down on that if it's if honestly it's you competing with God you're\n\n06:43.000 --> 06:58.000\nsuperstitious like you're like I'm a linebacker there's nothing between me there's no commercial way to measure my ability no way to do it yeah like like so if your socks you know famously like athletes they're like oh I don't I only wear these socks they're very superstitious people\n\n06:58.000 --> 07:12.000\nsuperstitious sailors and athletes and actors very so I would say like the odds are probably the opposing team I think that they I think that there was a stunt how does a black cat end up running onto a football field\n\n07:12.000 --> 07:22.000\nwas it fully black or did it have fully white you know totally black what city was this in what was the home stadium does anyone know the answer to that question\n\n07:22.000 --> 07:28.000\nalso the Giants versus the Cowboys was it\n\n07:28.000 --> 07:46.000\nSteve okay so a black cat crossed the Giants meadowlands wherever the fuck that feels I just gotta imagine that would play hell with any football player worth their salt like if the game was worth anything like and that if you were an opposing team you'd be like also don't you think\n\n07:46.000 --> 08:00.000\nthere should be an arms race you'd be like you know how we get these fuckers I heard that so and so on the opposing team is like really superstitious like you should step on a crack just bring just bring your aunt Stacy's cat in a bag\n\n08:00.000 --> 08:05.000\nyou let it go you put the quarterback under a ladder\n\n08:05.000 --> 08:21.000\nso he has to I don't think any fan gets into an arena with a cat in a bag I don't think that any cat like lives in a football arena and then ends up in the field I believe that one of those teams it isn't a jersey though the Giants play in Jersey\n\n08:21.000 --> 08:34.000\nyeah so it's fucking Jersey baby you don't you don't know what's going to go on you just think that new Jersey Jersey baby their lax culture you don't think they're you think their football arena is more prone to have just like I don't know like fucking\n\n08:34.000 --> 08:50.000\nokay here's what I think you said the cat was fat it was very fat how fat was he it was fat enough that it had like a perceivable double chin and that like if you're watching it and you were a cat person or even an animal person\n\n08:50.000 --> 09:09.000\nyour heart went like oh I I I heard I heard the fat was tuned cat I heard the cat was so fat that when it stands in a street corner the cops y'all break it up the cat the cat that's how fat Rob Rob how fat was that cat\n\n09:09.000 --> 09:23.000\nit's not like it had a double chin it had a double chin yeah yeah and how do you how do you tell I didn't see the they showed like because the thing is they got so many they're like you can see it in the live moment\n\n09:23.000 --> 09:43.000\nthe cat the sports castors are so excited because the cat was like running in the end zone and so of course the sports castors are doing their job they're going like oh look at his double chuckleback like you know like like the cats like running from the people that are trying to get it out of the field and they're like oh that cats got a good quick quick change or whatever like like like they're having the time of their lives they live for this shit\n\n09:43.000 --> 10:12.000\nhe came back out dressed as a clown and but then came back out dressed as Sharon then coming back from commercial then they had all these instant replays because they go to the slo-mo footage of the cat galloping and it's it's got a little bit of saliva coming up its lips which is not quite enough for you to go oh it's a rabid cat but it was just enough like oh the cat's going under a great deal of stress like I just if the cat hadn't been overweight I would have been like fine it's like a cat that's like it's it's got its own thing\n\n10:12.000 -->

40:40.000\nand I may\n\n40:40.000 --> 40:42.000\njust be speaking for myself I think you're too harsh on yourself\n\n40:42.000 --> 40:44.000\nwhen you're talking about all of these issues\n\n40:44.000 --> 40:46.000\nBritish and black people are telling me that\n\n40:50.000 --> 40:52.000\nholy fuck\n\n40:52.000 --> 40:54.000\nthere is what we finally fucking figured out\n\n40:56.000 --> 40:58.000\nthat's like a vice\n\n40:58.000 --> 41:00.000\ngrip of self-esteem like\n\n41:00.000 --> 41:02.000\nsqueezing me right in the center\n\n41:02.000 --> 41:04.000\nI'll be specific it's on issues\n\n41:04.000 --> 41:06.000\nwhere you are like worried about\n\n41:06.000 --> 41:08.000\nhow\n\n41:08.000 --> 41:10.000\nmoral you are or how like\n\n41:10.000 --> 41:12.000\nwoke you are and I think sometimes\n\n41:12.000 --> 41:14.000\nyou worry too much you are not\n\n41:14.000 --> 41:16.000\non that side of the spectrum\n\n41:16.000 --> 41:18.000\njust because\n\n41:18.000 --> 41:20.000\nit's fancy to say that every\n\n41:20.000 --> 41:22.000\nwhite guy is on that side of the spectrum\n\n41:22.000 --> 41:24.000\nlike you are surprisingly woke\n\n41:24.000 --> 41:26.000\nfor your circumstances\n\n41:26.000 --> 41:28.000\nand we need\n\n41:28.000 --> 41:30.000\npeople like that on the team\n\n41:30.000 --> 41:32.000\nhi\n\n41:32.000 --> 41:34.000\nwe need you on the team\n\n41:34.000 --> 41:36.000\nyeah I'm not\n\n41:36.000 --> 41:38.000\nsecretly thinking to myself as I go home\n\n41:38.000 --> 41:40.000\ngod damn it I'm Joe Rogan again\n\n41:40.000 --> 41:42.000\nlike I know that I'm left\n\n41:42.000 --> 41:44.000\nof everything productive\n\n41:44.000 --> 41:46.000\nbut that's\n\n41:46.000 --> 41:48.000\nI think it's only fair for me to say\n\n41:48.000 --> 41:50.000\nthat Dan paid Omnia to come here\n\n41:50.000 --> 41:52.000\ntonight\n\n41:52.000 --> 41:54.000\nI wish I could use the one\n\n41:54.000 --> 41:56.000\nno I'm kidding\n\n41:56.000 --> 41:58.000\nto give her money to buy her server\n\n42:00.000 --> 42:02.000\nwhich I would not know how to use but the reason I\n\n42:02.000 --> 42:04.000\nsay it is not because I think that you think\n\n42:04.000 --> 42:06.000\nyou're right of center but that I think\n\n42:06.000 --> 42:08.000\nI mean again\n\n42:08.000 --> 42:10.000\nif you listen to everything that Obama said this week\n\n42:10.000 --> 42:12.000\nit makes sense in context\n\n42:12.000 --> 42:14.000\nhe was saying like it doesn't help\n\n42:14.000 --> 42:16.000\nto kick people out the team that mean well\n\n42:16.000 --> 42:18.000\nand y'all mean well\n\n42:18.000 --> 42:20.000\nand so you're part of the team\n\n42:20.000 --> 42:22.000\nand yeah every now and then we're going to go\n\n42:22.000 --> 42:24.000\nokay that wasn't great\n\n42:24.000 --> 42:26.000\nbut it's better that\n\n42:26.000 --> 42:28.000\nthan oh Nazi like\n\n42:28.000 --> 42:30.000\nyou don't have to do all of that\n\n42:30.000 --> 42:32.000\nsidelining all of the time it can be\n\n42:32.000 --> 42:34.000\na group effort and mood for it together\n\n42:34.000 --> 42:36.000\nwe don't perceive me as somebody who's like\n\n42:36.000 --> 42:38.000\nI think I've been pretty vocal about the fact that\n\n42:38.000 --> 42:40.000\nwe need to definitely forgive the ignorant\n\n42:40.000 --> 42:42.000\nyeah but I think that\n\n42:42.000 --> 42:44.000\nthe\n\n42:44.000 --> 42:46.000\nI can't even remember what the specific context\n\n42:46.000 --> 42:48.000\nwas but at the time\n\n42:48.000 --> 42:50.000\nthere was a situation where you were kind\n\n42:50.000 --> 42:52.000\nof worried that or maybe I misinterpreted\n\n42:52.000 --> 42:54.000\nthat you were worried that\n\n42:54.000 --> 42:56.000\nall of these ignorant people\n\n42:56.000 --> 42:58.000\nthat are ignorant for the sake of being ignorant\n\n42:58.000 --> 43:00.000\nthey're not ignorant because they actually\n\n43:00.000 --> 43:02.000\nwant to learn are we forgive\n\n43:02.000 --> 43:04.000\nall of them it's there is\n\n43:04.000 --> 43:06.000\na very small line and distinction\n\n43:06.000 --> 43:08.000\nand I think because\n\n43:08.000 --> 43:10.000\nmaybe I'm online a bit more I see it more\n\n43:10.000 --> 43:12.000\nthat there are there's a difference\n\n43:12.000 --> 43:14.000\nbetween forgiving everybody\n\n43:14.000 --> 43:16.000\nthat's ignorant and forgiving those that are\n\n43:16.000 --> 43:18.000\noperating good faith\n\n43:18.000 --> 43:20.000\nand so when you sympathize with the people\n\n43:20.000 --> 43:22.000\nthat aren't operating in good faith they're not\n\n43:22.000 --> 43:24.000\nthen not on the team but again I've taken\n\n43:24.000 --> 43:26.000\nthis in a completely political direction I didn't\n\n43:26.000 --> 43:28.000\nright but I want to make sure you I mean\n\n43:28.000 --> 43:30.000\nyou\n\n43:30.000 --> 43:32.000\nI totally agree with you\n\n43:32.000 --> 43:34.000\nand like I do you think\n\n43:34.000 --> 43:36.000\nbecause I feel like that's\n\n43:36.000 --> 43:38.000\nthat's the position that I'm in\n\n43:38.000 --> 43:40.000\nlike I'm like I gosh I wish\n\n43:40.000 --> 43:42.000\nI wish that we weren't\n\n43:42.000 --> 43:44.000\nso hard on each other\n\n43:44.000 --> 43:46.000\nbecause by each other\n\n43:46.000 --> 43:48.000\nI include like people\n\n43:48.000 --> 43:50.000\nwho are like they don't know if someone's\n\n43:50.000 --> 43:52.000\nlike five years off a\n\n43:52.000 --> 43:54.000\nTwitter and they don't know that\n\n43:54.000 --> 43:56.000\nthey're supposed to say this instead of that\n\n43:56.000 --> 43:58.000\nright dog pile them\n\n43:58.000 --> 44:00.000\nlike I find myself\n\n44:00.000 --> 44:02.000\nsaying the same thing\n\n44:02.000 --> 44:04.000\nthat a piece of shit might say\n\n44:04.000 --> 44:06.000\nhowever\n\n44:06.000 --> 44:08.000\nfor the better reason which is like\n\n44:08.000 --> 44:10.000\nguys we can't\n\n44:10.000 --> 44:12.000\ntear each other apart\n\n44:12.000 --> 44:14.000\nso like I don't know\n\n44:14.000 --> 44:16.000\nthis is British black girl stamp of approval in that opinion\n\n44:16.000 --> 44:18.000\njust in case you needed it\n\n44:18.000 --> 44:20.000\nbut you probably didn't because Brandon also\n\n44:20.000 --> 44:22.000\nis on this list\n\n44:22.000 --> 44:24.000\nhere's some advice you can give me as a British\n\n44:24.000 --> 44:26.000\nblack girl I think because\n\n44:26.000 --> 44:28.000\nlike I feel\n\n44:28.000 --> 44:30.000\nas British\n\n44:30.000 --> 44:32.000\nand black as a white\n\n44:32.000 --> 44:34.000\nAmerican can feel which is that\n\n44:34.000 --> 44:36.000\nI feel like\n\n44:36.000 --> 44:38.000\nI gotta\n\n44:38.000 --> 44:40.000\nwe'll be right back\n\n44:40.000 --> 44:42.000\nthis is blue apron\n\n44:42.000 --> 44:44.000\nhas a few words to say\n\n44:44.000 --> 44:46.000\nI really do hope we\n\n44:46.000 --> 44:48.000\ncut through me on this ad right there\n\n44:48.000 --> 44:50.000\nin that I just feel like\n\n44:50.000 --> 44:52.000\nI am so\n\n44:52.000 --> 44:54.000\nand I cop to this where I'm like\n\n44:54.000 --> 44:56.000\nI am so\n\n44:56.000 --> 44:58.000\nunaccustomed to strife\n\n44:58.000 --> 45:00.000\nand confusion that\n\n45:00.000 --> 45:02.000\nI just like\n\n45:02.000 --> 45:04.000\nI've bailed and that\n\n45:04.000 --> 45:06.000\nlike I think you could speak to\n\n45:06.000 --> 45:08.000\nwhere you're like you're British\n\n45:08.000 --> 45:10.000\nand you're black and you're a woman\n\n45:10.000 --> 45:12.000\nlike I think if you could probably\n\n45:12.000 --> 45:14.000\ntalk some sense into me because I'm like\n\n45:14.000 --> 45:16.000\nthis is fucking hard\n\n45:16.000 --> 45:18.000\nwhen you're getting it from all sides\n\n45:18.000 --> 45:20.000\nright because I feel like\n\n45:20.000 --> 45:22.000\nif I advocate for\n\n45:22.000 --> 45:24.000\nhey everybody should be allowed\n\n45:24.000 --> 45:26.000\nto say whatever the fuck they want\n\n45:26.000 --> 45:28.000\nit's like I just I always feel\n\n45:28.000 --> 45:30.000\ncaught in the middle of everything\n\n45:30.000 --> 45:32.000\nI feel like\n\n45:32.000 --> 45:34.000\nlisten to you on any of that\n\n45:34.000 --> 45:36.000\nlike if you were to Francis tell me\n\n45:36.000 --> 45:38.000\ngrow the fuck up you're 46\n\n45:38.000 --> 45:40.000\nlike suck it up\n\n45:40.000 --> 45:42.000\nI mean first of all anything that you're\n\n45:42.000 --> 45:44.000\nfeeling is valid because it's 2019\n\n45:44.000 --> 45:46.000\nanything you're feeling is valid\n\n45:46.000 --> 45:48.000\nyou're not invited to the conversation\n\n45:48.000 --> 45:50.000\nlisten but no\n\n45:50.000 --> 45:52.000\nwhat I was gonna say is like\n\n45:54.000 --> 45:56.000\nit's down to kind of\n\n45:56.000 --> 45:58.000\nyou have to start from a place of\n\n45:58.000 --> 46:00.000\nlisten life\n\n46:00.000 --> 46:02.000\nhow how will we even hear\n\n46:02.000 --> 46:04.000\nand you go into the full philosophical thing of\n\n46:04.000 --> 46:06.000\nwe're on this planet and we're only here\n\n46:06.000 --> 46:08.000\nfor a certain amount of time so\n\n46:08.000 --> 46:10.000\nhow are we gonna make this as good for everyone\n\n46:10.000 --> 46:12.000\nas we can how are we gonna make\n\n46:12.000 --> 46:14.000\nthis as pleasant for everyone as we can and how are we\n\n46:14.000 --> 46:16.000\ngonna be fair to everyone historically\n\n46:16.000 --> 46:18.000\nand moving forward once you think of everything\n\n46:18.000 --> 46:20.000\nin that macro sense this\n\n46:20.000 --> 46:22.000\nmicro stuff\n\n46:22.000 --> 46:24.000\ncontextualizes so if you're\n\n46:24.000 --> 46:26.000\nfeeling it like it's happening and it's coming\n\n46:26.000 --> 46:28.000\nfrom all sides it's like really really intense\n\n46:28.000 --> 46:30.000\ntake a step back and think\n\n46:30.000 --> 46:32.000\nof like the overall movement we're trying to\n\n46:32.000 --> 46:34.000\nmake you're advocating\n\n46:34.000 --> 46:36.000\nfor a thing that looks like long ago\n\n46:36.000 --> 46:38.000\nin this podcast when I was going on tour I was\n\n46:38.000 --> 46:40.000\nlike we need a code we need an algorithm\n\n46:40.000 --> 46:42.000\nwe need a simple algorithm\n\n46:42.000 --> 46:44.000\nthat we can fall back\n\n46:44.000 --> 46:46.000\non in any situation of conflict where we go\n\n46:46.000 --> 46:48.000\nwait wait a minute alright I'm getting my tempers\n\n46:48.000 --> 46:50.000\nup my politics are getting in the way\n\n46:50.000 --> 46:52.000\nall those micro stuff but like let me fall\n\n46:52.000 --> 46:54.000\nback and go for instance\n\n46:54.000 --> 46:56.000\nis there a human being hurt right now\n\n46:56.000 --> 46:58.000\nyeah that kind of thing\n\n46:58.000 --> 47:00.000\nwe need a code\n\n47:00.000 --> 47:02.000\nfor instance the reason I find the green new deal\n\n47:02.000 --> 47:04.000\nto be the best set of policies\n\n47:04.000 --> 47:06.000\nthat have been put together for\n\n47:06.000 --> 47:08.000\nclimate change is that it takes into account\n\n47:08.000 --> 47:10.000\nhistorical ways of taking care\n\n47:10.000 --> 47:12.000\nof the planet peoples that have been wronged\n\n47:12.000 --> 47:14.000\nlike all of that stuff needs to be\n\n47:14.000 --> 47:16.000\npart of the conversation\n\n47:16.000 --> 47:18.000\nwhile we move forward like everything has\n\n47:18.000 --> 47:20.000\nto take in history everything has to take\n\n47:20.000 --> 47:22.000\nin people that hurt now people hurt in the\n\n47:22.000 --> 47:24.000\npast people hurt maybe even by things in\n\n47:24.000 --> 47:26.000\nthe future and I know it's a very happy to\n\n47:26.000 --> 47:28.000\nbe aware of doing things but I just feel like\n\n47:28.000 --> 47:30.000\nif you come from a place of like\n\n47:30.000 --> 47:32.000\nlove for one another and also\n\n47:32.000 --> 47:34.000\njust kind of\n\n47:34.000 --> 47:36.000\njust acknowledging everybody and I think\n\n47:36.000 --> 47:38.000\nit's tough to do when\n\n47:38.000 --> 47:40.000\npeople are refusing to do\n\n47:40.000 --> 47:42.000\nthe same thing it's tough to\n\n47:42.000 --> 47:44.000\nstay very kind of\n\n47:44.000 --> 47:46.000\nopen heart and stuff for\n\n47:46.000 --> 47:48.000\npeople but as long as you're operating\n\n47:48.000 --> 47:50.000\nfrom that on a macro scale\n\n47:50.000 --> 47:52.000\nwhen the Nazis come out you know that\n\n47:52.000 --> 47:54.000\nthey are the Nazis\n\n47:54.000 --> 47:56.000\nand we move together\n\n47:56.000 --> 47:58.000\nright and I mean\n\n47:58.000 --> 48:00.000\nI'm not sure how helpful that is\n\n48:00.000 --> 48:02.000\nand you know who you are\n\n48:02.000 --> 48:04.000\nthey were clapping everybody\n\n48:04.000 --> 48:06.000\nyou're all Nazis you were clapping\n\n48:06.000 --> 48:08.000\nbecause you love your name being mentioned\n\n48:08.000 --> 48:10.000\nno that's very helpful\n\n48:10.000 --> 48:12.000\nyou said you don't know how helpful that is\n\n48:12.000 --> 48:14.000\nit's incredibly helpful look you don't know how lost\n\n48:14.000 --> 48:16.000\nI feel sometimes and I feel like I'm 46\n\n48:16.000 --> 48:18.000\nand I don't suck my thumb about it anymore\n\n48:18.000 --> 48:20.000\nthat's part of my struggle too is like\n\n48:20.000 --> 48:22.000\nyou're 46 you're not allowed to suck your thumb\n\n48:22.000 --> 48:24.000\nit's like I'm not allowed to be a baby anymore\n\n48:24.000 --> 48:26.000\nthat's not inspiring\n\n48:26.000 -->

funny\n\n48:56.000 --> 48:58.000\nin 1930 and then he\n\n48:58.000 --> 49:00.000\nslowly turned thousand\n\n49:00.000 --> 49:02.000\nand then he got me too to anyway\n\n49:02.000 --> 49:04.000\nthere is no guard against it\n\n49:04.000 --> 49:06.000\nhistorical wrongs\n\n49:06.000 --> 49:08.000\nthere is no\n\n49:08.000 --> 49:10.000\nI just don't want to be that guy\n\n49:10.000 --> 49:12.000\nI started this\n\n49:12.000 --> 49:14.000\npodcast from a standpoint of\n\n49:14.000 --> 49:16.000\nthe joy of going\n\n49:16.000 --> 49:18.000\nbaby I'm crying out\n\n49:18.000 --> 49:20.000\nand the world has shifted\n\n49:20.000 --> 49:22.000\nunder my feet like it's not\n\n49:22.000 --> 49:24.000\nit's not right and it's not charismatic\n\n49:24.000 --> 49:26.000\nto be the baby\n\n49:26.000 --> 49:28.000\nthat I was five years ago\n\n49:28.000 --> 49:30.000\nand that is a credit to the world that we live in\n\n49:30.000 --> 49:32.000\nan absolute credit\n\n49:32.000 --> 49:34.000\ndo you think then that's part of the reason why this is going away\n\n49:34.000 --> 49:36.000\nwhen you said I want this to stop\n\n49:36.000 --> 49:38.000\nyes because I don't think that it is\n\n49:38.000 --> 49:40.000\nappropriate to\n\n49:40.000 --> 49:42.000\ngo\n\n49:42.000 --> 49:44.000\nit's hard to beat me I don't find that\n\n49:44.000 --> 49:46.000\nit doesn't matter whether it's right or wrong\n\n49:46.000 --> 49:48.000\nobjectively I don't\n\n49:48.000 --> 49:50.000\nfeel right\n\n49:50.000 --> 49:52.000\ndoing it anymore\n\n49:52.000 --> 49:54.000\nI don't like it it doesn't come

50:10.000\nI've tried going down that aisle in my mind\n\n50:10.000 --> 50:12.000\nwhere I'm like let me signal boost\n\n50:12.000 --> 50:14.000\nthis socialist and this fucking charity\n\n50:14.000 --> 50:16.000\nand all these things and it's kind of like fumbled\n\n50:16.000 --> 50:18.000\nthere's a socialist over there\n\n50:18.000 --> 50:20.000\nI\n\n50:20.000 --> 50:22.000\nI you

01:06:28.000\nwhen you're a teenager you don't listen to anybody\n\n01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000\nand so it did\n\n01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000\nand it even did after I graduated\n\n01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000\nbut they weren't ever part of that part of me\n\n01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000\nand so when\n\n01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000\nthis little one at the age of three months\n\n01:06:38.000

01:06:54.000\nyou know the child is singing\n\n01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000\nand so that happened\n\n01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000\nfrom the age of kind of three months\n\n01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000\nonwards and so when she said\n\n01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000\nthat was what I want to do\n\n01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000\nI said you go girl\n\n01:07:04.000 -->

protest I was I was so angry but it but then you knew we knew that\n\n01:29:25.400 --> 01:29:43.400\nI mean it tanked that season and my girls out of and out of protest they really did they refused to watch it and so I think I think that I think that it's it's if people like you exist and the way that you write exists you've got to be out there doing a lot more\n\n01:29:43.400 --> 01:30:03.400\nyeah you got it I would say you might not be familiar with his morning workouts I am I am you are I am now it's getting freaky well my daughters my daughters follow him so so I know

loved\n\n01:32:29.400 --> 01:32:42.400\nwhoa no no not it chief no you feel let down by him yes like yes yes it's usually a British perspective on Kanye\n\n01:32:42.400 --> 01:32:48.400\npainful and what the British perspective on Kanye is basically well I mean the British black perspective on Kanye\n\n01:32:48.400 --> 01:32:53.400\nis basically the black perspective on Kanye like we loved you during Katrina\n\n01:32:53.400 --> 01:33:05.400\nwe we we kind of feel that he's flown the coupe a bit and we're like what's going on how could you not when you get the power to build your own geodesic domes\n\n01:33:05.400 --> 01:33:14.400\nyeah he's just like what do I do to rebel against myself yeah no but obviously he's become a Ralph Bakshi cartoon\n\n01:33:14.400 --> 01:33:27.400\nbut from the story of everyone I know now I like meet these icons and I'm like god damn it can we all fuck on you yeah oh yeah I'm at Kanye\n\n01:33:27.400 --> 01:33:34.400\nthey're good friends you know I thought that was like a known thing he came to the Rick and Morty office he was fucking cool man\n\n01:33:34.400 --> 01:33:46.400\nis he gonna be on the show they made an episode together is that a secret I talked to him for like two and a half hours\n\n01:33:46.400 --> 01:33:59.400\nI found him to be truly like I didn't he steal Rob's hoodie he threw Rob's hoodie in the garbage we didn't talk about this\n\n01:33:59.400 --> 01:34:08.400\nlike Kanye came in because it Kanye has like this thing he's like the most I told that none of you will believe it\n\n01:34:08.400 --> 01:34:14.400\nKanye had this hoodie and he's like the hoodies the most important article of clothing in the history of America or whatever\n\n01:34:14.400 --> 01:34:23.400\nand to his point he's like he's saying like because it's like poor people can buy a hoodie rich people want a hoodie whatever that was his thing\n\n01:34:23.400 --> 01:34:31.400\nand then he was like he they had this big thick hoodie on and then he kept he's like pointing he's pointing at Schrab and he's like\n\n01:34:31.400 --> 01:34:40.400\nlike that hoodie what's the deal and Schrab at this fucking shitty like sweatshirt that he and Kanye put it on and was like\n\n01:34:40.400 --> 01:34:45.400\nsee what the fuck is this no I didn't put it out he didn't put it on right away and he looked at the tag and he was like\n\n01:34:45.400 --> 01:34:55.400\nH.N.M. and he was like Boop Wildered by it's like H.N.M. and then we lost track of it for a while and an hour later\n\n01:34:55.400 --> 01:35:05.400\nwe're like where's Schrab's hoodie it was in the garbage Kanye West threw Rob's hoodie in the fucking garbage\n\n01:35:05.400 --> 01:35:13.400\nlike it was a dirty Kleenex he found on the coffee table and it wasn't a bit like like I'll be the first guy to tell you like\n\n01:35:13.400 --> 01:35:19.400\nKanye West has a he's an intelligent guy with a huge like like he's capable of having a sense of humor about himself\n\n01:35:19.400 --> 01:35:26.400\nwe talked a bunch about how it would be funny you could change my mind about him because the only reason I don't feel heavy about\n\n01:35:26.400 --> 01:35:31.400\nKanye is because I haven't talked to Kanye about what the hell's going on and I never will because I'm a pleb\n\n01:35:31.400 --> 01:35:38.400\nhe's super charismatic and like there's absolutely nobody that's gonna like everything you've seen about him is curated through\n\n01:35:38.400 --> 01:35:45.400\nand if you wear the wrong hoodie that's in the fucking trash can but that was crazy recycle bin which was like\n\n01:35:45.400 --> 01:35:54.400\nRob's hoodie was in the trash can and we were all like Rob's hoodies in the trash can and Kanye was like\n\n01:35:54.400 --> 01:36:01.400\nhe didn't he didn't own it like it was like it was like did he have somebody else around or he actually said this\n\n01:36:01.400 --> 01:36:09.400\nthis isn't even clothing to me so this belongs to Rob's hoodie in the garbage can he didn't even care that you saw it\n\n01:36:09.400 --> 01:36:14.400\nbecause no one saw it until it was already in the garbage can he wore it for a while because he like wore it for a while\n\n01:36:14.400 --> 01:36:19.400\nand he was like well he actually tried his on to prove a point yeah he was wearing Schrabs hoodie for a while and he was like\n\n01:36:19.400 --> 01:36:26.400\nman I look built in this like because Schrabs hoodie was smaller but then it disappeared after a while and it was just gone\n\n01:36:26.400 --> 01:36:34.400\nand then we were like where's Schrabs hoodie it's in the garbage and they were like Kanye did you throw Rob's hoodie in the garbage\n\n01:36:34.400 --> 01:36:38.400\nKanye was, did you throw Rob's hoodie in the garbage?\n\n01:36:38.400 --> 01:36:44.400\nand he wouldn't he would like if he had done it as a joke he would have been like ha ha he was like huh\n\n01:36:44.400 --> 01:36:51.400\nand that's when I knew like that guy is fucking play on top of the world or he was like he actually\n\n01:36:51.400 --> 01:36:56.400\nwhen he was realizing that moment he's like yeah it probably did\n\n01:36:56.400 --> 01:36:58.400\nbut actually I shouldn't have\n\n01:36:58.400 --> 01:37:04.400\nwhen you mind him being on the phone while you asked him that was he ordering Schrab and new Kanye hoodie?\n\n01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:06.400\nno we were in a room together\n\n01:37:06.400 --> 01:37:12.400\nlike I'm saying the wastebasket was next to him and he was like on his phone and he was like huh\n\n01:37:12.400 --> 01:37:15.400\nbut there was no contrition no acknowledgement of the crime\n\n01:37:15.400 --> 01:37:22.400\nhe was like he was he kind of like we were like Kanye did you throw Rob's Schrabs hoodie in the garbage can\n\n01:37:22.400 --> 01:37:30.400\nwith all of the garbage and he was like including all his entourage like he had these cool dudes with him\n\n01:37:30.400 --> 01:37:35.400\nlike I will also say that like Kanye's got like fucking cool dudes around him like\n\n01:37:35.400 --> 01:37:36.400\nhow cool\n\n01:37:36.400 --> 01:37:44.400\nfucking two two cool two really cool dudes who like have been hanging out with him forever like super cool dudes\n\n01:37:44.400 --> 01:37:49.400\nlike and then like one dude one dude who scared the shit out of me\n\n01:37:49.400 --> 01:37:51.400\nthat's the security\n\n01:37:51.400 --> 01:37:58.400\nlike a fuck yeah like this crazy white dude in fucking Kev like like like fucking paramilitary gear\n\n01:37:58.400 --> 01:38:04.400\nwho like I didn't notice until I went to the bathroom outside the writer's room and then I was like huh\n\n01:38:04.400 --> 01:38:08.400\nokay and the guy was like huh\n\n01:38:08.400 --> 01:38:12.400\nhis job was he had one job just to make sure\n\n01:38:12.400 --> 01:38:19.400\nI'm gonna say he has two jobs one is when Kanye hands off a hoodie his job is to dispose of the hoodie\n\n01:38:19.400 --> 01:38:23.400\nthat guy had nothing to do with any of the chat like that guy's job was to fucking like as soon as he\n\n01:38:23.400 --> 01:38:28.400\nhe checked the perimeter of the writer's room like his head ducked in and he was like looking around\n\n01:38:28.400 --> 01:38:32.400\nhe's like what what's going on what's this room that Kanye's going into\n\n01:38:32.400 --> 01:38:36.400\nand then he fucking stood post outside the writer's room and he was out there\n\n01:38:36.400 --> 01:38:42.400\nI went to pee and I made the huge mistake of like I was like I came back from peeing\n\n01:38:42.400 --> 01:38:47.400\nand I was like I made some joke or something like thanks for letting me pee\n\n01:38:47.400 --> 01:38:52.400\nlike nothing stupid and he just steered through me like a terminator\n\n01:38:52.400 --> 01:38:58.400\nand I was like holy shit he will kill me like if I make the slightest wrong move\n\n01:38:58.400 --> 01:39:02.400\nhis job is to keep anyone from getting in this room and killing Kanye\n\n01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:06.400\nhis boss is a motherfucking monster\n\n01:39:06.400 --> 01:39:09.400\nno he's not a monster don't don't I won't let it\n\n01:39:09.400 --> 01:39:12.400\nI've defended Kanye from the fucking moment\n\n01:39:12.400 --> 01:39:15.400\nno it's a lyric from a song then don't don't don't get offended\n\n01:39:15.400 --> 01:39:16.400\ncan I\n\n01:39:16.400 --> 01:39:18.400\nhe's not a monster he's not a monster\n\n01:39:18.400 --> 01:39:23.400\ncan I can I poke holes in his logic if his idea is that oh hoodies that for everybody\n\n01:39:23.400 --> 01:39:27.400\nand that even the people who can't afford very good hoodies can wear hoodies\n\n01:39:27.400 --> 01:39:30.400\nwhy did he throw rubs in the trash\n\n01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:34.400\nI don't think he knew he threw rubs in the trash\n\n01:39:34.400 --> 01:39:36.400\noh it was just like a reflex\n\n01:39:36.400 --> 01:39:38.400\nhe was cleaning up\n\n01:39:38.400 --> 01:39:42.400\nI truly think that consciously in his mind he thought he was throwing it in the diaper\n\n01:39:42.400 --> 01:39:47.400\ncan I extend Kanye some meaningless benefits of meaningless doubts\n\n01:39:47.400 --> 01:39:50.400\nhe tried on Rob Schrab's hoodie\n\n01:39:50.400 --> 01:39:52.400\nit was a little too small for him\n\n01:39:52.400 --> 01:39:55.400\nhe felt a little flexed up and he goes you know what\n\n01:39:55.400 --> 01:39:59.400\nI didn't take a shower today or I put on too much cologne today\n\n01:39:59.400 --> 01:40:01.400\nI can't give this back to him\n\n01:40:01.400 --> 01:40:03.400\nhe's gonna like\n\n01:40:03.400 --> 01:40:07.400\nI spilled some chili on it\n\n01:40:07.400 --> 01:40:09.400\nhe liked it\n\n01:40:09.400 --> 01:40:11.400\nand he fucking loved Schrab\n\n01:40:11.400 --> 01:40:13.400\nlike Kanye was fixated on Schrab\n\n01:40:15.400 --> 01:40:17.400\nlike he loved Schrab\n\n01:40:17.400 --> 01:40:19.400\nokay so he has good taste\n\n01:40:19.400 --> 01:40:21.400\nand then he left\n\n01:40:21.400 --> 01:40:23.400\nand I won't let anybody talk shit\n\n01:40:23.400 --> 01:40:26.400\nwasn't there a dissertation on why one hoodie was better than the other\n\n01:40:26.400 --> 01:40:29.400\nlike he laid them out on the table\n\n01:40:29.400 --> 01:40:31.400\nElon and I won't let people talk shit about him either\n\n01:40:31.400 --> 01:40:33.400\nand Kanye won't let people talk shit about Elon\n\n01:40:33.400 --> 01:40:35.400\nand probably won't talk shit about Elon\n\n01:40:35.400 --> 01:40:37.400\nbut because Kanye was like\n\n01:40:37.400 --> 01:40:39.400\nhis favorite movie is The Aviator\n\n01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:41.400\nand I'm
