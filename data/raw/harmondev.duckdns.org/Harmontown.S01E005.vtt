WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:24.000
Here you, here you, oh yes, oh yes, hey nani nani, welcome to Harmontown everybody, how are you tonight?

00:24.000 --> 00:36.000
As cop-troller of Harmontown, I Jeff Davis officially declare this session of Harmontown to be in session

00:36.000 --> 00:42.000
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon

00:42.000 --> 01:01.000
Thank you, thank you, you're a good crowd, you're a good crowd, I don't say that every week, because they aren't always good crowd

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
No no, I won't get away with that lie anymore because we're on the internet now

01:05.000 --> 01:16.000
I am notoriously bad at opening shows, case in point, what I just did, what was that, but I want you to think of it as more of an evolution of performance on stage

01:16.000 --> 01:31.000
The almighty mudskipper for instance, the link between fish and breathing reptile, well not a graceful entrance, but perhaps one of the most important things that ever happened

01:31.000 --> 01:42.000
A floundering, slimy, sweaty, gross thing, gasping for air in mud, think about it, next time you're about to judge somebody

01:42.000 --> 01:47.000
So this show is flopping its way onto the shore of entertainment

01:47.000 --> 01:56.000
Here's another awkward transition to a greater world, maybe you heard of him, Jesus Christ

01:56.000 --> 02:04.000
Don't you feel a little bad about how you welcomed him? So I ask you again, are you having a good time tonight?

02:04.000 --> 02:15.000
I'm kidding, sorry, I don't even remember those people that leverages people emotionally, I didn't mean to do that

02:15.000 --> 02:23.000
The theme of tonight is confession, if we're going to found a new colony as we will one day, I promise

02:23.000 --> 02:29.000
Let's talk about the Mars developments later, Jeff has a theory that I think is very important for him to confess

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
We'll get to this

02:31.000 --> 02:39.000
Or we won't, because we're both drunk and that segues me into what I think is the more important theme

02:39.000 --> 02:45.000
But I'll just say to you later, if the show is dragging later, as opposed to now

02:45.000 --> 02:49.000
This rocket ship that we're on right now

02:49.000 --> 02:55.000
We see this look on our face that you may have sometimes seen where we're like, hey, hi, Jim Henson, why?

02:55.000 --> 03:04.000
Feel free to shout out Mars, and we'll get Jeff started on his obsessive theories about what's happening there right now

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
I can stand by everything I think

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
But I want to start with the theme of confession, partly because our surprise guest tonight

03:10.000 --> 03:15.000
I think he's a good way to start things out and I want to get him out of here because he's doing us a favor

03:15.000 --> 03:22.000
I don't have a lot of guests anymore, I went on our following guests podcast live in San Francisco

03:22.000 --> 03:26.000
Months and months and months ago during the comedy festival in San Francisco

03:26.000 --> 03:34.000
And they had some preamble to their podcast, there's four guys that host it, or maybe there was only two

03:34.000 --> 03:40.000
I don't know, I walked in pretty drunk

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
And they all did stand up

03:42.000 --> 03:48.000
Why were you that drunk? You knew that you were at a comedy festival, you're a professional

03:48.000 --> 03:54.000
Why did you show up that drunk?

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
The show was on at eight and you just started drinking at two or what?

03:57.000 --> 04:04.000
I think it was on at, let's say it was on at nine and I got there at eight thirty, but then I wasn't on until midnight

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
That was part of my whole shtick

04:06.000 --> 04:12.000
If you listen to the thing I come out and I'm like, you kept me waiting back there and I was doing a bit

04:12.000 --> 04:20.000
My bag of tricks is like I go, I'm angry, it's a dumb bit, I just fall back on it

04:20.000 --> 04:26.000
My dad hit me too much, I think it's funny to come out and go like, I was waiting backstage forever

04:26.000 --> 04:32.000
And then I started making fun of them for doing stand up, which precipitated me making fun of stand up in general

04:32.000 --> 04:37.000
Which resulted in me over and over and over again, for those of you who are alcoholics

04:37.000 --> 04:42.000
You know the first thing that goes out the window is your sense of overkill and timing

04:42.000 --> 04:51.000
You become a six year old child who's just like, well this is funny, and if they stop laughing I'll just wait for them to remember how funny it is

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
It's called Harmontown

04:54.000 --> 05:02.000
I kept doing this joke over and over and over again where I was just doing a joke about jokes

05:02.000 --> 05:08.000
I was pretending to be a stand up and going, well black people are on a podcast like this, and white people are on a podcast like that

05:08.000 --> 05:12.000
And that reaction happened, the silence

05:12.000 --> 05:17.000
When I was growing up it was a big deal, you know, you point out the differences between black people and white people

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
It was very celebrated, very funny

05:20.000 --> 05:24.000
And I picked the wrong decade to lampoon that

05:24.000 --> 05:28.000
And I picked the wrong substance to lampoon it out, for all I know

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
But most of this is a blur to me

05:30.000 --> 05:34.000
The important thing about tonight's story before I bring them up, this is how I want to introduce him

05:34.000 --> 05:38.000
Because I barely know this guy, I was on his podcast once, I've met him twice

05:38.000 --> 05:45.000
He was here last week because he was finishing a podcast upstairs here at Meltdown with John Crickfalussi

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
And I happened to bump into him

05:47.000 --> 05:51.000
I haven't seen you since I ruined your podcast, why haven't you aired it?

05:51.000 --> 05:58.000
And I expected the answer to be, well because you're a big sloppy drunk shithead and you fucked up the whole thing and it's unarable

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
Which I would accept, but I would also be like, fuck you you prude

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
If that was his answer

06:03.000 --> 06:10.000
His answer was, well, you know, by the time we started being ready to release it, that Chevy Chase thing happened

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
And then that happened and we waited for that to cool out

06:13.000 --> 06:20.000
And then, like, you got fired and there was no point in time where I felt like, ah

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
We're doing this guy a big favor by airing this episode

06:27.000 --> 06:31.000
But he said that, I was like, wow, you're a good guy

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
Would you come up tonight? You want to be a guest thing?

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
And I was like, dude, I know you have dinner plans

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
He's like, maybe next week, and he showed up tonight

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
He showed up in the green room and I said, how quick can we get you out of here?

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
He said, as quick as possible, and I've already betrayed him

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
But I wanted to make sure my introduction was fitting

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
Because I want you to know, because I don't know that much about him

06:51.000 --> 06:55.000
I only know that about him, which I think is a lot

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
He's a gentleman in a world without gentlemen

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
I don't know what we're going to do with him

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
Let's just talk to him, maybe tee off the theme of confession

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
Ladies and gentlemen, Doug Benson

07:06.000 --> 07:10.000
What?

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
Wow, sorry, what? I didn't know who it was

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
I just presumed

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
Please welcome to what is basically his own stage, Chris Hardwick

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
Come on, come on

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
Hey, hello Dan Harmon

07:30.000 --> 07:34.000
Pussy fever, got pussy fever

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
Oh my god, thank god

07:36.000 --> 07:41.000
Pussy fever, I don't want the cure

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
It's sad now

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
That's a thing from community, and it's so sad now

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
You should drop the song down into a minor key, so it's sad

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
Pussy fever

07:55.000 --> 08:00.000
When you research St. Patty's Day and you find out that the colours are moose

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
People got slaughtered

08:01.000 --> 08:05.000
You dig deep in any holiday and you find out some guy got hung upside down and eviscerated

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
Now pussy fever is like the book Hot Zone

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
Where it's just like, everyone sits down

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
I don't know what that means

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
That was the monkey book

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
That was a brave confession

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
See, we're confessing tonight

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
That's good

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
That was a nice long intro

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
Yes, the truth of the matter was

08:23.000 --> 08:27.000
I was worried that, because you were making fun of stand up

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
Which I know as a comedian

08:29.000 --> 08:33.000
And the audience was way on board with you at first

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
And then, there's a point

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
Until I tried to introduce them to what I call the rule of 18s

08:41.000 --> 08:46.000
The rule of 18s, which is 1 through 9, really funny

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
10 through 15

08:48.000 --> 08:52.000
Wow, and then 16, 17, 18, even more hilarious

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
Andy Kaufman is reborn

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
This is a picture I took of you on stage

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
It's a picture of me, I look like a frog

08:59.000 --> 09:03.000
It looks like Dan's drunk on the stage

09:03.000 --> 09:10.000
Basically, it looks like a toddler photograph from a Sears portrait studio

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
Because I was learning to walk

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
And this is where you were like, grinding

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
I was humping the stage

09:17.000 --> 09:21.000
You were grinding your junk into the stage going, bag people do this

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
And white people do this

09:23.000 --> 09:28.000
And there was no subject

09:28.000 --> 09:33.000
And so, at a certain point, a couple of people were like, hey

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
And I just didn't, it was not at all about race

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
Nothing you were doing was actually about race

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
But I just didn't, when the Chevy thing broke

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
I didn't want it to be another TMZ or someone goes

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
And look at this offensive thing he's doing over there

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
This guy is full of stuff

09:48.000 --> 09:52.000
I had become Charlie Sheen for a most exhilarating three weeks of my life

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
I was Charlie Sheen, on a very minor scale

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
And if people don't get weird

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
I just didn't want people to make it about something that it was never about

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
It was about you making fun of us

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
Because he came out, you didn't go on a midnight

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
But it wasn't early

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
So, okay, maybe we have some contention here

10:10.000 --> 10:15.000
I think I was waiting back there long enough to drink two bottles of Grey Goose

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
That's how I measure time

10:17.000 --> 10:22.000
I don't know

10:22.000 --> 10:26.000
So we, you know, we did stand up up top of the show

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
And then you came out

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
And I love that you were making fun of us

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
And you were making fun of standard

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
It was such a great dynamic on the show

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
But we always want people to feel like, you know, fun

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
And celebrated and positive and supportive

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
But I'm also safe

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
And safe

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
And you just didn't want, you know, I just didn't want the wrong person

10:43.000 --> 10:47.000
To take something that they read in a headline out of context and say

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
Oh, that Dan Harmon did this

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
And he's like, no, you weren't there

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
He wasn't about that at all

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
And so that's all

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
It was just sort of like

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
That's what my story is

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
It doesn't even matter if you're right or wrong

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
The fact that that's the diamond loop you have in your eye

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
When you're looking at anything

11:01.000 --> 11:05.000
Makes you one of the last true gentlemen in a horrible wasteland

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
Really, we're all eating each other

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
I mean, I would like to think I would also, the thought

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
That thought would also cross my mind

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
I don't know

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
But I was like, I was just astounded

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
It was like, I did not expect to hear that coming out of your mouth

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
I really don't know you

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
And for you to extend me that courtesy

11:22.000 --> 11:26.000
I expected to see a guy ride by on a giant bicycle

11:26.000 --> 11:31.000
I felt like we were in an era where you put your pinky out when you drank

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
And you put a cape over the thing

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
It seemed like second nature to you

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
You had enough problems going on back then

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
Yeah, I just didn't want to end that

11:39.000 --> 11:43.000
But the truth of the matter is the audio on live shows is very, very difficult

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
We do get a lot of complaints on that

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
Because we set, you know, four mics are set on the table

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
And people lean back, people lean forward

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
You know, the audience's mics separately

11:52.000 --> 11:56.000
And audio levels on live shows are just very hard to normalize

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
So that was actually the other issue

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
So it really was a couple of things

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
But it was a really fun show and I'm glad that you did it

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
And we'll have you back on

12:03.000 --> 12:07.000
Also, racism levels are hard to normalize too

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
I don't know

12:08.000 --> 12:16.000
It's also hard on a podcast to really get the sensation of a white man humping a stage

12:16.000 --> 12:22.000
Supposedly lampooning something while inventing a new art form himself

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
Well, yeah, I mean, I think people here know, but it's a classic

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
It's sort of a classic stand-up

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
You know, when you're making fun of stand-up comedy

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
You say things like, men and women are like this

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
And San Francisco and New York are like this

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
And flying is like this

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
And black people do this

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
The Simpsons have the classic, you know

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
Black people drive a car like this

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
Dude, dude, dude, you know, white people are like

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
And classic is the important word

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
I was doing it 20 years after everyone already got the joke

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
It's that one Simpsons episode where Homer's on the couch and he's watching

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
And he's like, it's true, we're so lame or whatever

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
And it's like, and they made, you know, like they

12:56.000 --> 13:00.000
So that is a classic stand-up, making fun of stand-up joke

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
But I just didn't want people to misconstrue what it was actually about

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
Well, I thought it was amazing

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
My philosophy is, I got drunk, went on your show

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
And said stuff into a recorder

13:08.000 --> 13:13.000
Also, I'm currently famous for playing a guy's voicemail into a thing

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
I don't think you can go ahead, let it loose

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
My deals are closed with CBS and Fox

13:18.000 --> 13:22.000
My favorite part about how druggy was that came out

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
You were like, you would talk for a second

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
And you were like, yeah, you know, Heat Vision and Jack would

13:26.000 --> 13:30.000
I am so drunk and it is your fault

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
It is your motherfucking fault that I am this drunk

13:33.000 --> 13:36.000
I've been backstage for five hours

13:36.000 --> 13:39.000
It wasn't really five hours, but it must have felt like it

13:39.000 --> 13:42.000
But I do have to apologize, we should not have all done stand-up

13:42.000 --> 13:45.000
Before you came out, we should have just brought you out

13:45.000 --> 13:50.000
Well, you shouldn't have met Myra Headline

13:50.000 --> 13:53.000
I just said that to get a laugh and it didn't get enough of it

13:53.000 --> 13:56.000
No, are we going to get a confession out of Chris?

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's what it was about

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
I said to you backstage, because here's the other thing about Chris

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
I don't know how public it is and how much it is

14:01.000 --> 14:05.000
But I know that my girlfriend, after I did this, after I did this debacle

14:05.000 --> 14:09.000
It was after that that my girlfriend, Erin, who came to San Francisco

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
With me and watched this whole thing

14:11.000 --> 14:15.000
She was like, you know, part of that might have been a little bit of this

14:15.000 --> 14:19.000
You know, Chris is sober, he used to drink

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
Now he doesn't anymore

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
And people that used to drink and now don't anymore

14:23.000 --> 14:27.000
Like a good 85% of them are pretty uncomfortable around people

14:27.000 --> 14:30.000
No, no, no, it's a good reminder that I made the right choice

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
Yeah, that's how I'd think of it

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
That's how I'd assume

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
No, no, no, I don't care

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
I've been sober for nine years

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
I don't even remember

14:40.000 --> 14:44.000
I have flashes of like, oh yeah, I used to be that

14:44.000 --> 14:48.000
I've now ponded off on, I had this fat brother named Peter

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
And he used to fuck shit up

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
I don't even take responsibility for it anymore

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
But I thought, because tonight's theme is confessions

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
We're having to come up

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
And I'm confessing that I ruined your podcast

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
And I did it because I'm an alcoholic asshole

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
No, no, no, it wasn't

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
And you're a great stand-up guy

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
No, no

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
I was wondering if you, in the green room I said

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
Like, maybe in classic sober fashion

15:10.000 --> 15:13.000
Maybe you have a confession

15:13.000 --> 15:17.000
A couple drunken, I can give you a couple drunk confessions

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
One is sort of a cool story, bro

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
Because it doesn't really go anywhere

15:21.000 --> 15:27.000
But in 2001, I went to London and I was visiting

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
I just went to London for a couple weeks

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
Because you can literally drink everywhere in London

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
Like, you can drink in museums

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
You can drink in zoos

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
Like, everywhere, it just has alcohol

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
And they think it's adorable and charming

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
And so when I started to know I had a problem

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
I was like, wow, I really fit in here

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
Like, I knew I had a problem

15:43.000 --> 15:46.000
And because I was just all about it all the time

15:46.000 --> 15:50.000
And Zach Alfenakis was out there shooting a submarine movie

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
Called Below

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
And so I stayed with him for a couple days

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
And we went out one night

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
And he was with these, the other actors in the movie

15:57.000 --> 16:00.000
Were these like pretty schmancy British actor types

16:00.000 --> 16:03.000
And so we went to all these underground British clubs

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
And I got really fucking drunk

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
And at about 3 a.m. somewhere in London

16:07.000 --> 16:10.000
I tried to hit on Bjork

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
Alright

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
Got it

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
That headline works in tabloid format

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
With an exclamation point

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
I tried to hit on Bjork

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
I tried to hit on Bjork

16:22.000 --> 16:26.000
Can you, what was your first move?

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
My first move was staring at her for an hour and a half

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
Right?

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
That's actually good

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
Because she's fascinated by fire hydrants

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
She is

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
She probably mythologized you

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
Yes, whenever she speaks this weird subtitle

16:40.000 --> 16:43.000
With a brush script font appears

16:46.000 --> 16:50.000
And so, you know, I was basically just like this

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
I must have felt like it was like 10 minutes

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
But it really was like an hour and a half

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
And so Zach and all these other, all of his

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
Schmancy British actor friends were like

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
Yeah, cause it's alright if we go

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
And I'm like, no man, I'm only going to make my move

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
I'm going to hit on Bjork

17:04.000 --> 17:07.000
And she was talking to some other people

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
And then finally

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
They were ready to leave

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
And I'm like, okay, I'm going to do it

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
And so I walk up to her

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
And I tap her on the shoulder

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
And she turns around like this

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
You know, just looking all Bjorky

17:19.000 --> 17:24.000
And I'm like

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
Like I take the breath in

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
To go to ask her a question

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
And she sees me

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
And immediately just turns around

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
And scampers up

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
She may have disappeared

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
In a pile of dust

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
Or been swallowed by the earth

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
I'm not 100% sure

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
She's from Iceland

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
She knows when she's getting a puke done

17:42.000 --> 17:45.000
She's turned into a pile of fire salts

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
And I don't know what happened

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
So you never even had a conversation with her

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
And it was such a failure

17:49.000 --> 17:52.000
And then she immediately started talking

17:52.000 --> 17:53.000
To some other guy

17:53.000 --> 17:56.000
So I have to walk with all these people

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
Who I'd been making wait forever

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
For this utter moment of failure

18:01.000 --> 18:04.000
And we end up going back and hanging out

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
And I was sitting on the bed

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
And Zack videotaped me

18:07.000 --> 18:10.000
Being really bummed that I totally

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
Struck out with Bjork

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
And I'm like

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
Are you saying her by name?

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
Yeah, I'm saying her by name

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
And I'm like Bjork

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
And then she

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
I think I said like

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
And then this other guy showed up

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
He totally cock-bjorked me

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
Which I really said that

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
But I was genuinely bummed

18:31.000 --> 18:34.000
That in my drunken state of mind

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
That I had this moment

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
That it was a total failure

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
Like I would have had any chance

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
Well this brings to mind

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
This is something that I constantly want to ask

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
And I have probably the coolest sober person

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
I've ever talked to

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
In my life up here

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
So this is a perfect time to ask this

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
I hear that story

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
Perfect example

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
I go

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
So why aren't you still drinking?

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
What's wrong with that?

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
You gotta give

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
You gotta fucking get back on the Bjork saddle

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
And fucking

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
Well I mean

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
There's other Bjorks

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
I talked to other people

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
And they go

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
Like yeah I woke up in a puddle of blood

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
And I kept doing that

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
Third time I did it

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
Yeah you gotta stop waking up

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
In puddles of blood

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
Well no

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
You get a dark one

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
Don't think of it as a comedy show

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
Give us a second one

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
And then I'll let you go to dinner with the

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
With Bjork

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
A dark one

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
You know it wasn't

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
It wasn't just that there was like

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
It wasn't any specifically

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
That any one thing happened

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
It's just when I look back

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
At what my life was like back then

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
I had been on MTV in the 90s

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
And there was this sort of unspoken curse

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
Like well if you're on MTV

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
Like that's it

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
You know

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
Like you probably won't do anything else after that

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
Cause a lot of people didn't

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
And the business was less forgiving

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
Back then for crossing over

19:42.000 --> 19:43.000
Like if you were a VJ

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
If you're on MTV it was like

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
Yeah you know

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
Sort of like being what people consider

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
Like being an internet personality now

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
You know and someday that'll change

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
Or it's in the process of changing

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
And so I just

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
I was like chunky

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
And blotchy

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
And I wasn't working

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
And I think I just kind of looked at the

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
Sort of like here's the landscape of my life

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
I can keep doing this

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
Which would be fine

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
You know like I wasn't

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
I never had to go to the hospital

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
Well except for one time

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
I jumped over a wall

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
And like fucked up my foot

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
Like that was it

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
And I was also fat

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
And I had these leather pants

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
It was really embarrassing

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
I just never wear leather

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
No one

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
Were you fat and in leather pants

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
When you tried to pick up Bjork?

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
Yes I was as a matter of fact

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
And I think

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
Jeff put it together

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
And you know what

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
You know what

20:33.000 --> 20:36.000
I think in my drunken mind

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
I'm like I'm just like Jim Morrison

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
You know like this fucking fat guy

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
With leather pants

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
One day some hot girls

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
Gonna blow me in an elevator

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
And that never happened

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
That never ever ever happened

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
And so I think I just

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
You know I just kind of

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
The truthfully like sincerely

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
I just could have got to a point

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
It wasn't anything specifically bad happened

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
But just a period of my life

20:59.000 --> 21:00.000
Was just sort of like a dark ages

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
Where nothing really moved forward

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
And it just kind of kept getting

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
Worse and worse

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
And I just thought

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
You know right when I was about 30, 31

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
I was like you know

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
I can stay on this path

21:09.000 --> 21:10.000
And that's fine

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
I'm not gonna

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
I don't black out drunk

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
But nothing else really substantial

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
Is probably really gonna happen in my life

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
But I also realized

21:18.000 --> 21:21.000
Wow I have this crazy ability

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
To focus on something

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
Like I'm clearly addicted to alcohol

21:25.000 --> 21:28.000
So you know what if I could refocus that

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
You know so like there was this idea

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
Of maybe I could take this demon that I had

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
And figure out how to spin it

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
In a way where I could use it

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
Instead of denying that I had it

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
So I did you know I go on

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
Okay

21:39.000 --> 21:42.000
As Jeff goes to the vodka bucket

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
And so you know I did

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
And then when I quit

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
Then I realized like

21:47.000 --> 21:48.000
Oh yeah I had all these problems

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
That I wasn't dealing with

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
And then you know

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
There was a little period where I

21:51.000 --> 21:54.000
Where I had to you know fix the brain

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
Every conversation I had with people

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
Like the first question is

21:57.000 --> 21:58.000
Are you an alcoholic

21:58.000 --> 22:01.000
I immediately I can't say yes fast enough

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
The reason is because

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
I caught on to the game

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
If you say no you're an alcoholic

22:06.000 --> 22:07.000
Right

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
Oh yeah some people will

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
Like oh you're in denial huh

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
You're like but you didn't even give me the

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
Yeah I just clicked the blue wire

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
Right away

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
I don't care if it blows up or

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
It diffuses the bomb but

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
I'm not gonna stand there and go

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
There you go

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
It sounds like an alcoholic to me

22:24.000 --> 22:28.000
Because 85% of everyone is a dick

22:28.000 --> 22:31.000
Yeah 85% of all drunks are dicks

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
And 85% of all sober people are dicks

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
And you meet less sober people

22:35.000 --> 22:36.000
Than you meet drunks

22:36.000 --> 22:37.000
So if you're drunk

22:37.000 --> 22:38.000
And you meet a sober person

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
85% chance you're gonna have

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
A fucking bad time

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
Because you don't meet that many

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
And 85% of them are dicks

22:45.000 --> 22:48.000
And a sober dick is somebody

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
Who gets as much identity

22:50.000 --> 22:53.000
From being sober as a drunk

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
Gets out of being drunk

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
Like you met them when you were drunk

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
You met them when they were drunk

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
Like alcohol was their life

22:59.000 --> 23:00.000
I'm a drunk

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
I love being drunk

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
Let's drink

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
And then they find Jesus

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
Or they get sober

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
And then it's like

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
I'm sober

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
Are you sober?

23:09.000 --> 23:10.000
I'm sober

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
Young people talk like this

23:11.000 --> 23:12.000
Sober people talk

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
But I never knew you were sober

23:21.000 --> 23:24.000
I walked into your life

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
Pissed on your stage

23:26.000 --> 23:30.000
Raped your dog

23:30.000 --> 23:31.000
Did a shot of Fernette Bronca

23:31.000 --> 23:32.000
Walked out

23:32.000 --> 23:33.000
And then someone else told me

23:33.000 --> 23:34.000
You know, he's sober

23:34.000 --> 23:35.000
Oh, but I don't really

23:35.000 --> 23:36.000
It never bothers me

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
Because I don't, you know

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
I'm definitely not someone

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
Who looks around everyone

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
And they're like

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
That person should probably

23:42.000 --> 23:43.000
I have my problems

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
Other people have their own path

23:45.000 --> 23:46.000
I just don't fucking

23:46.000 --> 23:47.000
You know, like

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
That's just how it is for me

23:49.000 --> 23:50.000
I just don't tell people

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
I don't judge people that way

23:52.000 --> 23:55.000
Alright, how do you judge people?

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
Alright

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
Do you want to plug anything

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
Or you don't need to

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
You're King Kong

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
No, no, no, no, no

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
I'm just glad that you're doing

24:05.000 --> 24:06.000
The show here

24:06.000 --> 24:07.000
Weekly now

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
I mean, it's really fun

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
And I love

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
For anyone who's listening

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
About four people support that

24:11.000 --> 24:12.000
But I love

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
For anyone who's listening

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
To this podcast

24:14.000 --> 24:15.000
You should really know

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
Like Dan walks the line

24:17.000 --> 24:18.000
When people are lining up

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
Get suggestions

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
Talks to people

24:20.000 --> 24:21.000
Like there's a very

24:21.000 --> 24:22.000
Communal thing

24:22.000 --> 24:23.000
Are you enjoying your time here?

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
It must be nice

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
It's not therapy

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
It's nice, right?

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
I won't do therapy

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
I can't do it

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
What do you not like about therapy?

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
It's dumb people

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
Oh, shit

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
Holy shit

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
Mothra just flew on stage

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
Flying cockroach

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
Curt, it's a flying cockroach

24:39.000 --> 24:40.000
A cockroach

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
The size of a hubcap

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
Just hit Dan in the chest

24:44.000 --> 24:45.000
The hair stood in the back of my head

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
I thought somebody threw a frisbee in it

24:47.000 --> 24:48.000
No, I thought

24:48.000 --> 24:49.000
I thought a group of therapists

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
Got busted

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
I thought I was going to get

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
Fucking murdered by

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
The middle of the bell curve

24:57.000 --> 24:58.000
A pherodactyl

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
I thought that people with the minimal

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
Requirements for degrees

25:02.000 --> 25:03.000
Yeah

25:03.000 --> 25:04.000
And judging people

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
You call a demographic

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
Stupid and a giant animal

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
Get infected

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
That's an argument for shamanism

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
If anything

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
Actually

25:13.000 --> 25:14.000
I didn't say shamanism was bullshit

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
Whoever sent that moth up here

25:16.000 --> 25:17.000
Dan, snake, snake

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
I like to think that that was

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
The drunk fairy

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
And

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
Dan, you tell him

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
But it's undoing

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
The thing is not dead

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
Can we kill it?

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
We crushed it

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
Someone crushed it

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
A hero in our audience

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
Step forward and slayed the dragon

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
Quickly, men

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
Holy shit

25:39.000 --> 25:40.000
Quickly

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
The greatest adventure

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
Stretch me a toothpick

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
We must place its head on a spike

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
To warn its compatriots

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
Oh my god

25:49.000 --> 25:50.000
Dude

25:50.000 --> 25:51.000
Dude

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
You fucking destroyed

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
But I didn't even flesh

25:55.000 --> 25:56.000
Just got up and just

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
Just dispatched it

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
Now

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
Emily's coming up with a napkin

26:00.000 --> 26:01.000
Like

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
Like it's 50s radio

26:03.000 --> 26:04.000
Now my question is

26:04.000 --> 26:05.000
My question is

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
What if that was Bjork in fairy form

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
It was like

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
I have been summoned

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
To somebody

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
I've spoken my name

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
Three times

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
And then she shows up and then

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
Blam

26:23.000 --> 26:24.000
She had her chance

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
Where you were fat and in leather

26:28.000 --> 26:29.000
A real fairy would have seen

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
The prince that you were going to become

26:31.000 --> 26:32.000
That's right, she didn't know

26:32.000 --> 26:33.000
Let's thank Chris Hardwick

26:33.000 --> 26:34.000
Thank you, everyone

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
Thank you, Dan Harmon

26:36.000 --> 26:37.000
Thank you, Jeff Davis

26:43.000 --> 26:44.000
Thank you, Chris

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
That was delightful

26:46.000 --> 26:47.000
I can't think of a better

26:47.000 --> 26:48.000
Closer

26:48.000 --> 26:49.000
I didn't know

26:49.000 --> 26:50.000
I don't know how to close

26:50.000 --> 26:51.000
I warned him in the green room

26:51.000 --> 26:52.000
I don't know how to do interviews

26:52.000 --> 26:53.000
But please come up

26:53.000 --> 26:54.000
Because I want to tell people

26:54.000 --> 26:55.000
How cool you are

26:55.000 --> 26:56.000
For all I know

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
He could be a rapist

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
I don't know

26:58.000 --> 26:59.000
I don't know anything about him

26:59.000 --> 27:00.000
I know two things about him

27:00.000 --> 27:01.000
And they suggest that he's like

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
A knight in shining armor

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
He seems like a cool guy

27:04.000 --> 27:05.000
Yeah, I see right through it

27:05.000 --> 27:06.000
I won't listen to

27:07.000 --> 27:08.000
No

27:08.000 --> 27:09.000
You caught up

27:09.000 --> 27:10.000
Immediately

27:10.000 --> 27:11.000
You zeroed in

27:11.000 --> 27:12.000
On the leather pants thing

27:12.000 --> 27:13.000
You're like

27:13.000 --> 27:14.000
What were you wearing?

27:15.000 --> 27:16.000
Like

27:16.000 --> 27:17.000
He's telling a story

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
I would guess that if

27:19.000 --> 27:20.000
You're really drunk

27:20.000 --> 27:21.000
And you're floating with Bjork

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
And you're at a low point in your life

27:23.000 --> 27:24.000
You probably also are fat

27:24.000 --> 27:25.000
And have leather pants on

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
It takes a Jeff to notice these things

27:29.000 --> 27:30.000
We all just heard

27:30.000 --> 27:31.000
It takes a Jeff

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
All we heard is that Bjork's a bitch

27:33.000 --> 27:34.000
Anyways

27:34.000 --> 27:35.000
No

27:35.000 --> 27:36.000
No, he's cool

27:37.000 --> 27:38.000
Also, real quickly

27:38.000 --> 27:39.000
That Chris Hardwick section

27:39.000 --> 27:40.000
Of Harmontown

27:40.000 --> 27:41.000
Was brought to you by

27:41.000 --> 27:42.000
Adidas

27:43.000 --> 27:44.000
Nike

27:44.000 --> 27:45.000
Yes

27:47.000 --> 27:48.000
All of Harmontown

27:48.000 --> 27:49.000
Is brought to you by

27:49.000 --> 27:50.000
The top-of-the-line

27:50.000 --> 27:51.000
Comfort-fitting

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
State-of-the-art shoe

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
Strap on the smooth comfort

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
And easy walkability of Adidas

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
You piece of shit at Nike

27:59.000 --> 28:00.000
We're doing this for free

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
For Adidas until you pony up some money

28:02.000 --> 28:03.000
Fuckin'

28:03.000 --> 28:07.000
We're inverting the advertising paradigm

28:07.000 --> 28:08.000
Nike

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
Pay us money

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
To make us stop telling you

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
Adidas is the most perfect shoe

28:14.000 --> 28:17.000
You will ever wear in your fucking life

28:18.000 --> 28:19.000
It's like putting your foot

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
Into a uterus of comfort

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
Who's working for who?

28:24.000 --> 28:25.000
Pick up a phone, Nike

28:25.000 --> 28:26.000
Your douchebags

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
Adidas isn't paying us a dime

28:28.000 --> 28:31.000
We just decided to fucking love them

28:32.000 --> 28:33.000
Nike

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
We're gonna strong arm Nike into it

28:37.000 --> 28:38.000
It might cost a dollar

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
To make us stop advertising Adidas

28:40.000 --> 28:43.000
Unless Puma gives us 10

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
Anybody can beat Greg Proups

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
And get Spotify or the good

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
Adam and Eve, Audible.com

28:51.000 --> 28:52.000
Yon

28:52.000 --> 28:53.000
Yon

28:53.000 --> 28:54.000
Yon

28:54.000 --> 28:55.000
What is this?

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
This feels terrible with Erin McGathy?

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
What are these bullshit?

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
It's new and noteworthy

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
But I don't see it in the top 10

29:04.000 --> 29:07.000
I don't see it in the hard numbers

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
This feels terrible with Erin McGathy

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
It's new, it's noteworthy

29:10.000 --> 29:11.000
What does that mean?

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
Our show is the Adidas of podcasts

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
Until further notice

29:18.000 --> 29:21.000
You hear that, you Nike cocksuckers?

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
You're throwing money away

29:25.000 --> 29:28.000
There's other techniques we could try next week

29:29.000 --> 29:30.000
Nike, next week

29:30.000 --> 29:33.000
We're gonna start coming at you from different angles

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
We're gonna start saying we like Nike

29:35.000 --> 29:39.000
And we're gonna have pillowcases on our heads

29:40.000 --> 29:43.000
We're gonna have swastikas on our foreheads

29:43.000 --> 29:44.000
I would say as a podcast

29:44.000 --> 29:45.000
Let's do something less visual

29:45.000 --> 29:46.000
Yeah, you're right, you're right

29:46.000 --> 29:47.000
Sorry

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
We're gonna say that was Nike's idea

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
We're gonna die broke thinking like that, man

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
Alright, alright, alright, alright, sorry

29:58.000 --> 30:01.000
I've never been a Madison Avenue type

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
Confession

30:04.000 --> 30:07.000
So Chris Hardwick was very, very gracious

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
to tell us about his former life

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
as a fun-loving drunkable

30:12.000 --> 30:13.000
He confessed some things

30:13.000 --> 30:16.000
I told us things that he was embarrassed about

30:16.000 --> 30:19.000
I've been going through the stack of audience submissions

30:19.000 --> 30:20.000
I pulled a few aside

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
There's some really dark ones in here

30:22.000 --> 30:23.000
Do you wanna talk about

30:23.000 --> 30:26.000
I only have, I'll read down a list of things that I had

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
on my list of things to talk about

30:28.000 --> 30:29.000
Adidas

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
Right

30:30.000 --> 30:31.000
Check

30:31.000 --> 30:32.000
Confessions

30:32.000 --> 30:33.000
Check

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
Mustard Buttsalot

30:35.000 --> 30:36.000
Nope

30:36.000 --> 30:37.000
Yeah

30:37.000 --> 30:38.000
That's a quickie

30:38.000 --> 30:39.000
We were at the drawing room

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
and Dan was talking about

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
like people in high school that are

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
like if you have a silly name, right?

30:45.000 --> 30:46.000
Like some people that

30:46.000 --> 30:47.000
I was illustrating the point

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
that if you had a silly name

30:49.000 --> 30:50.000
and this is one of those things

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
that we've talked in point

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
We've talked about this on the

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
in the show

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
so if any of you have been here

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
and don't feel cheated

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
now that we're podcasting

31:01.000 --> 31:02.000
We're breaking out the chess box

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
Edit out point

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
If any of you wanted to just yell out

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
I hate Mexicans

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
You should have done it in there

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
Now it's on the record

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
I don't know what that means

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
I don't know why I'm so racist

31:20.000 --> 31:21.000
Why are you so racist?

31:21.000 --> 31:22.000
Why is everything about race?

31:22.000 --> 31:23.000
You're fascinated by race

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
Because it was brought up

31:24.000 --> 31:25.000
to not be racist

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
and I just think it's something

31:27.000 --> 31:28.000
that people care about

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
You marvel at Mexicans

31:30.000 --> 31:31.000
and Asians

31:31.000 --> 31:32.000
and black people

31:32.000 --> 31:33.000
Yeah, I think

31:33.000 --> 31:34.000
because it's like

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
Okay, when you go bowling

31:36.000 --> 31:37.000
Your job is to...

31:37.000 --> 31:38.000
Oh, here we go

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
The reason I'm fascinated with race

31:41.000 --> 31:42.000
I think

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
This is my defense of my fascination

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
with race and racism

31:46.000 --> 31:47.000
When you go bowling

31:47.000 --> 31:48.000
You never see black people...

31:48.000 --> 31:49.000
No, I'm kidding

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
That's what you thought I was going to say, isn't it?

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
No, when you go bowling

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
There's pins down there

31:56.000 --> 31:57.000
and the goal of bowling is

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
you take a ball and you roll it

32:01.000 --> 32:02.000
The reason why it's a sport

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
and not just a thing that you do

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
is because of these gutters

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
The gutters represent this thing

32:08.000 --> 32:09.000
It's like by default

32:09.000 --> 32:10.000
what happens is your ball

32:10.000 --> 32:11.000
rolls into the gutter

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
and you don't hit a single pin

32:13.000 --> 32:16.000
So you have to thread this needle

32:16.000 --> 32:17.000
with bowling

32:17.000 --> 32:18.000
and with communication

32:18.000 --> 32:19.000
and with culture and stuff

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
I said with our perception

32:21.000 --> 32:22.000
of what race is

32:22.000 --> 32:23.000
and what racism is

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
we're so obsessed with it

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
and I'm always fascinated by the gutter

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
I'm fascinated by the fact that

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
oh, if it goes too far to the left

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
it just goes in there

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
and that's the default response

32:35.000 --> 32:36.000
And I don't know

32:36.000 --> 32:37.000
Are we...

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
Is the guy that owns the bowling alley

32:39.000 --> 32:40.000
the right guy?

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
Is the guy that's making all the money

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
off of us threading this needle

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
Is he laughing all the way to the bank?

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
And is that the right bank?

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
Where are you going with this?

32:51.000 --> 32:54.000
If that's not interesting to you guys

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
you deserve Jeff Davis's Mars

32:56.000 --> 32:57.000
I didn't bring it up

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
I didn't bring it up

32:59.000 --> 33:02.000
I will take the time to tell you

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
Who's the hero in that bowling story?

33:06.000 --> 33:07.000
The person that's bowling

33:07.000 --> 33:08.000
is just any person

33:08.000 --> 33:09.000
any person at all

33:09.000 --> 33:10.000
It's a human being

33:10.000 --> 33:11.000
And what's the gutter?

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
The gutter represents the fact that

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
it represents the ball game

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
Rob Schrab has become a downright mutinous

33:30.000 --> 33:31.000
I'm telling you something

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
I was going to say talk to me after this show

33:33.000 --> 33:34.000
but don't

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
Talk to me before next week's show

33:38.000 --> 33:39.000
Let's all go bowling

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
That sounds really wild

33:41.000 --> 33:45.000
Or pledge $2,500 to the Anomalyza Kickstarter

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
and go drinking with me and Dino

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
and I'll tell you all about

33:49.000 --> 33:50.000
the bowling metaphor

33:50.000 --> 33:51.000
which I just landed on

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
I just made it up now

33:53.000 --> 33:54.000
It's fucking perfect

33:54.000 --> 33:55.000
I'm on to something

33:55.000 --> 33:56.000
I'm going to write a book

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
and I'm not going to share with any of you

33:58.000 --> 33:59.000
the profits

33:59.000 --> 34:00.000
You're not going to get a free copy

34:00.000 --> 34:01.000
You're not going to get anything

34:01.000 --> 34:02.000
because you didn't support me

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
You backed a hooligan

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
and my friend

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
And also that was brought to you by Nike

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
My thoughts on racism

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
are brought to you by Nike

34:14.000 --> 34:17.000
a shitty shoe

34:17.000 --> 34:18.000
in a dark world

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
a crappy cynical

34:20.000 --> 34:21.000
a fucking horrible world

34:21.000 --> 34:22.000
It stinks

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
Some guy has a spray disinfectant

34:24.000 --> 34:25.000
You put your foot in it

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
and I think there's a mouse in there

34:27.000 --> 34:28.000
Nike

34:28.000 --> 34:29.000
Bullshit

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
The guy that stepped on the Bjork ferry

34:31.000 --> 34:32.000
Cockroach

34:32.000 --> 34:33.000
Adidas

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
Just don't do it

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
Alright, now what is your beef with me and Mars?

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
We're talking about the curiosity

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
Let's do this quick

34:44.000 --> 34:45.000
and believe me

34:45.000 --> 34:46.000
I don't know

34:46.000 --> 34:47.000
there's been some contention

34:47.000 --> 34:48.000
that was erupted between you and me

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
but I want you to tell people

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
because I'm interested in you

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
I'm going to stop if I'm wrong

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
Jeff has become convinced

34:56.000 --> 34:59.000
since his tour of the JPL facility at NASA

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
where he thinks

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
as in most of Jeff's stories

35:03.000 --> 35:06.000
those of you who are hardcore Armenians

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
you know that when Jeff tells a story

35:09.000 --> 35:12.000
there's a theme

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
Don't interrupt me

35:14.000 --> 35:17.000
You're talking about me, why would I?

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
I'm going to make up a story

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
and try to fill it to the Jeff Davis template

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
of storytelling

35:23.000 --> 35:26.000
Jeff goes to a laundromat

35:26.000 --> 35:29.000
and he puts a shirt in the washing machine

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
and a beautiful Cuban woman

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
is like watching him

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
and she comes over and she asks him

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
why he's putting his shirt

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
in the washing machine in quite that way

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
and he explains

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
I don't know, I thought that the shirt

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
needed to be cleaned first

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
and she puts a hand on his arm and says

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
thank you

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
and then she takes him back

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
and introduces her family

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
and she just fucks him blue

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
Jeff has these stories

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
I don't think they're false

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
I think these things happen to Jeff

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
Jeff falls into these adventures

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
his personality is

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
they trust him

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
and they open up to him

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
and they want him to like them

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
and things

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
so Jeff went to the JPL facility

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
Jet Propulsion Lab

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
seems a little uninventive

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
for rocket scientists

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
invited by a friend to go to the

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
Jet Propulsion Laboratory

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
and it was a tour from a guy that works

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
and I won't get too specific about his job

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
I think that he was going to get in trouble

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
for saying too much

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
and you can see a little mock-up

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
of the Voyager probe and Cassini

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
and stuff like that

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
I like space travel stuff

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
and

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
we're going a little bit

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
behind the scenes

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
this is not on the regular tour

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
because I work on such and such a program

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
and we get to go see the rooms

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
where they're building

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
what is now called Curiosity

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
that I think last night successfully landed on Mars

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
and yeah

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
very cool

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
back then they called the Mars Science

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
Laboratory

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
another uncreated

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
these people are real Shakespeare's over there

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
and so we saw

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
it was just this big gigantic thing about the size of a Prius

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
and it's got a big

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
meaningful heavy backhoe

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
shovel on it and giant wheels

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
about like 10

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
to 12 inches across

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
this thing was mean, the rovers were the size of a coffee table

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
we're going back there with a purpose

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
like this big robust

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
like the previous one had little arms on it

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
we don't know if it's a bottle of wine so there's a corkscrew

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
we might have to kill a moth

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
so there's a little moth

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
we don't know what's going to happen

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
there's wheels on top and bottom

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
this thing was a bulldozer

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
this thing's going digging and analyzing

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
and it's very intense

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
and the people are very nervous

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
so now that thing that I got to see a little peek at

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
it's also very cool and very human

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
it made me so proud of humanity

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
looking on this titanium chassis

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
with these big wheels in the corner and this big shovel

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
with just a good old proper crescent wrench

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
just some dudes wrench

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
snap on tools

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
the Adidas of tools

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
you hear that Nike?

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
he had pieces of shit

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
cowards

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
so it was very cool

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
and so we're walking around the hallways

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
I'm talking to this guy, a scientist

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
and he works just about my age

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
and a little younger actually

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
I don't know about my age

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
he works and he flies spaceships

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
and stuff it's very cool and I said

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
were you there when the cameras turned on?

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
he doesn't fly spaceships

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
I don't want to get him in trouble

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
what? he gets in trouble if they tell him

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
what spaceship he flies?

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
was this Battlestar Galactica?

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
there's Cylons?

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
this is not an exaggeration

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
this is not yellow journalism here

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
I was walking through the thing

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
from Spirit

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
and Opportunity

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
you mean he controls spaceships?

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
yeah

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
he sends math

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
that flies probes and things around

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
I think he was like starbucks or something

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
he didn't sit in them

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
we fly them

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
we fly them remotely

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
these things

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
maybe one day they'll actually be people on Mars

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
because

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
of what I think was going on in this conversation

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
I said

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
when you were there

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
and when the cameras turned on

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
the first images were beamed back to Earth

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
and you didn't know if the thing was going to work

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
but you guys are all scientists

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
you guys watch sci-fi movies

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
you're clearly all

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
sci-fi enthusiasts

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
when that camera turned on

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
aren't you all holding hands and thinking

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
what if we saw a footprint

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
or a guy running by

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
or a snickers rapper

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
and he goes yeah

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
I'd be lying if I said that wasn't the case

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
so like

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
what did you see?

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
his eyebrows went up and he just kind of blushed a little bit

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
I go like did you see something cool?

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
he's like

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
he got kind of weird

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
and I go what did you see?

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
he shook his head no

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
did the throat cut thing and pointed at the ceiling

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
what's in the ceiling?

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
there's microphones

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
they're listening to us

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
I'm like what did you

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
fucking see?

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
and he's like stop it

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
can we go outside?

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
stop it

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
there's a little place next to the dumpster where they smoke cigarettes

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
there's no cameras

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
so anyways when the Martian dick

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
goes in your soup

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
it's like men in black

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
did you see a tree?

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
did you find diamonds?

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
what the fuck is going on up there?

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
and he was real bummed out

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
and he walked away from me and his face turned like plaid

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
he was so

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
he was like really bummed out and nervous about some shit

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
he's like I can lose my job

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
I can't talk about these missions

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
so he walked outside

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
and I'm like my friend Jerry

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
that took me and he's like dude what did you say to someone

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
so I'm like he was the guy

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
that blew it

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
and he's like yeah he's all bummed out

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
I want you to stop talking about that

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
so then

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
so then we go to this building

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
and we see this thing and they're building a giant Prius

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
with a huge backhoe shovel on it

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
like they're going fucking digging

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
they're going digging but I agree with that

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
you send up a little thing with a little brush on it

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
and then the next thing you said is a shovel

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
I do brush something

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
I don't think they found little people

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
I don't think they found

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
a subterranean colony

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
what race would they be? Martians

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
I'm sorry I'm obsessed with race

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
I don't mean to bore you assholes

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
I don't want to interrupt your fucking radio lab

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
but I think it's fucking

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
interesting that uh

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
anyways

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
you told me that you thought I was being conspiratorial

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
and overly imaginative

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
I don't think they found

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
I think there's ice under the surface

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
that they have to actually really dig for

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
because I think they found that

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
what they're going to find

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
is evidence of microbial life

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
or something like that

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
was some kind of life

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
maybe still exist or at least at one point did

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
because it wouldn't be life that as we know it

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
because the atmosphere is so low

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
it would be irradiated and stuff like that

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
I think they're going to go up there and maybe find

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
out that we're not the only

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
rocks spinning around

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
it's just as important to get that American flag on the moon

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
having an American

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
shuttle come back with a rock

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
and it has a little fossil of a little amoeba

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
that's basically going to look the same

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
as an earth amoeba

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
but it was on Mars 17 billion years ago

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
that's a big deal

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
it'll forever be, it's like hegemony

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
but it would be cool though if they went back

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
and we found out because we don't know what's up there

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
what if there was a little tiny underground people

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
like tiny underground people

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
and they see this giant

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
rocket, retro rocket thing

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
coming down at the size of the empire state building

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
as far as they are

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
what kind of thing would that be

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
like everything, you broke up with your girlfriend

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
it felt like Verizon's

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
trading on the Nasdaq

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
people are shooting people

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
left and right and everything's going

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
right and wrong and countries are like

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
China's dollars above the euro and all this stuff

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
and then they just dig a thing and there's little people

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
on Mars

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
just little dudes in line class

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
like Kevin Pollack and Willow

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
Mars! Hello!

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
I live on Mars!

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
Inside, have a cup of Martian juice!

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
and that's why the first

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
everything's just like, fuck it

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
like every guy

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
on every New York stoop

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
dropping a girl off after dinner

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
it's like, oh, can I have a kiss

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
and she's like, I don't know, I'm not committed

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
it's like, fuck it, life on Mars

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
like just everything changes

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
was it spirit or opportunity

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
when it broke down up there, I want to find out that it got Gulliver

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
traveled like that

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
they tied it down and they're like

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
what are these things and then like

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
we keep sending these robots up

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
and then we find diamonds

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
the reason we're going back there is they found a big book

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
a big diamond mine there

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
we're just going to send these little robot prospectors up there

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
and they're all going to be alone

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
they're all going to have beards after a while

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
everything turns into deadwood up there

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
because they found basically, what's the 8,000 pounds of diamonds

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
because it takes like

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
7 billion dollars to ship them back and forth

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
but in the end you make

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
1,100 bucks

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
and that's more money than NASA's made

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
ever

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
so everything becomes fucking deadwood up there

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
there's robot whorehouses and stuff like that

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
elsewhere

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
you cock sucker

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
I love that they grow beards automatically

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
the robots just have beards because

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
that's what you need to

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
one beard is insane like a Humpy Bogart

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
from Treasure of the Sierra Madre

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
alright, well this is the closest we've come to having

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
a thematic show on Confessions

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
there's just a random burst of technology

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
if you're listening at home

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
edit it yourself

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
we talked about Mars

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
but I want to have stuff like

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
people are so good

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
if you go down a line of people

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
I'm convinced and I'm not pandering

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
I think that Harmontown audiences

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
are the best audiences in the world

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
in the history of anything

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
for those of you listening

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
I'm not prompting them to say that

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
to do that

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
but I walked down the line

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
and I'm pushing the envelope of what we can ask of them

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
I said because we asked them

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
ask us questions about your job and all this stuff

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
this week I said

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
write down a confession

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
I'm going to try to

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
think of a confession just to get the ball rolling

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
Hardwick came up, he's very gracious

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
because

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
we need to be clear, we need to trust each other

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
I don't know if we've proven since we started podcasting that Harmontown has a safe place

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
for human beings

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
if you've done something that you're ashamed of

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
and you're sorry about it

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
maybe that should be

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
resolvable

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
I'm trying to think of something I'm really embarrassed about

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
Jeff and I were talking about

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
just lies that we told teachers

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
and stuff like that

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
we were pretty criminal minded kids

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
I was a really bad person

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
I think when you're up to age of 18

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
you're really a sociopath automatically

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
because everyone teaches you when you're young

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
because they're so scared of you

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
because when you're 18 the secret is

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
you can do whatever the fuck you want

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
you can beat anyone up

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
we draft them into our armies

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
when you're 18 that's when you're old enough

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
to hold a gun

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
and charge at another nation's

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
18 year olds

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
we are scared of 18 year olds

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
or we wouldn't use them to kill people

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
we found a place

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
to hide them

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
and because we're scared of them

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
very very clearly

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
you need to keep it cool brother

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
you need to

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
you're rewarded way too later if you learn how to act properly

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
and I do think that young people

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
not because

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
human beings are bad when they're younger

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
but because we put so much emphasis

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
on training

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
young people are sociopaths

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
because what they learn

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
for the first 18 years of their life

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
is that the reason not to do things

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
is that you'll get caught and you'll get in trouble

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
there's no emphasis

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
you have to kind of self learn

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
and I think only 15% of us do learn later

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
oh

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
I shouldn't do that because I'd be an asshole

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
most people spend

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
their lives going

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
I wish I could do that but I'd get caught

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
that's why we're fascinated with mafia

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
movies and serial killers

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
and stuff like that because we're like

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
what if I could you all have it within you

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
and hopefully we captured some

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
we want to hear the dark stuff

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
there's some dark ones in here

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
there's some goodies

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
I don't know that I could absolve you of it

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
but could a priest ever

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
could anybody ever

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
can you ever

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
a therapist ever

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
but also hearing it

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
anonymously

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
maybe you might save somebody else here tonight

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
let's hear a couple highlights

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
comment or not

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
but we can barrel through a bunch

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
all of you are in this room

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
I want to save that one because it's about race

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
I'm going to save that one

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
somebody writes

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
my first attempt at sex

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
was my first kiss

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
it didn't work because I didn't know female anatomy

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
and was just pushing my boner into her pubes

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
okay that's not a crime

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
that's called

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
every guy saying I thought

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
Chinese people were wearing lanterns

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
he didn't know

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
that's how I still do it

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
actually if you keep doing that long enough

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
it'll work

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
alright

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
that's basically how it works

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
I don't really like my sister

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
you're already absolved because

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
the fact that that's a confession

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
means you pretend you do

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
and that's your job as a brother

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
that's the best you can do

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
I ended a four year relationship

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
via email

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
the crowd

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
has spoken on that

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
I can't

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
this is why I didn't want to do questions

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
because I'm not good at answering

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
I'm not a life master

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
I would say don't try to give advice so much

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
just put yourself in their shoes

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
for instance

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
ran over the neighbor's cat

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
and didn't care, hate cats

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
alright

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
now we're getting deeper

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
that's amazing

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
we got some haymakers in here

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
that's a good confession because they don't bother

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
they're not expressing remorse

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
some of these you can go

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
you confessed it so you

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
solved

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
this person still hates cats

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
it feels bad

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
a serial killer saying put a rubber band around my nuts

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
I will kill again

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
and they do that

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
they go, castrate me

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
I'm begging you

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
that's tough

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
thank you

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
I wish I hadn't pushed

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
my cousin down the hill

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
in a dog crate

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
that just sounds like a story

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
and ended in a terrible mishap

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
you won't have the chance to do that again

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
you're fine

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
here's a goodie

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
pretty sure I have an STD

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
parenthesis

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
tame one

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
no symptoms

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
but haven't told my past partners

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
and probably won't tell my current one

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
how do you

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
alright well

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
yeah

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
in an email

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
in an email

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
should we stop and talk about that?

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
I don't know, we're not Dr. Drew

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
we didn't have

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
a guy ran over a cat

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
pretty sure I have an STD

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
a tame one

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
he means not AIDS

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
but he doesn't not mean

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
but he says no symptoms

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
he means herpes

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
if you have herpes you have symptoms

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
you know it

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
that's why one out of three people

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
in this room have herpes

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
is it because guys are dipshits

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
I'm saying it's a he only based on the handwriting

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
but that could be wrong

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
I feel like this is a guy

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
but guys don't show as much

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
symptomatically

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
so guys I'm just saying to you

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
if you're 19 years old and you're here

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
you come into Harmontown

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
it's just good advice, aside from this guy

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
I'm just saying herpes is like

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
it's a little bit of an epidemic

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
and it's partially because guys carry it around

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
and you need to get checked and stuff

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
that's all

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
how do you tell somebody

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
and she in the front row said

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
via email

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
this written

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
confession ends with a

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
frowny phase of motocon

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
so I think you're probably right about that

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
what do we say to that guy

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
first of all you do

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
you're going to tell your current partner

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
because every time you put your dick in her

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
you're putting a gun in her head

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
you have to take your medicine on that

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
the guy that ran over his cat

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
who's confessing that he doesn't give a fuck

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
about whether cats live or die

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
he probably has AIDS

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
he doesn't own

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
a veterinarian hospital

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
as a person

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
who's having sex with women constantly

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
you hate cats

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
and you own a veterinarian hospital

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
so you need to put a little sign on your thing

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
that says also may have herpes

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
you got to talk to the girl

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
she's got a shield

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
well here's a better solution

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
have her

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
give you handjobs until you get checked

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
I tried

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
I tried to make it easy for him

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
I don't know

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
that's a toughie man

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
you gotta fucking get checked

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
also herpes is hard to

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
let's just say he

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
actually I just injected herpes

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
I just assumed that

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
he didn't say herpes

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
if it's chlamydia

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
go to Planned Parenthood

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
take a pill it's gone

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
not that anyone was asking for advice

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
you were confessing stuff

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
my dick has a tick on it

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
what should I do with it

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
stop sticking it in people

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
you're not pretending

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
to give advice here necessarily

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
this is about getting things off our chest

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
when you go to a therapist

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
my parents hit me that's why I think

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
I'm a shitty writer

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
are you still hitting you

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
no I'm 39

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
I know I just have to ask

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
also we're also presuming

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
that people want to be anonymous about this

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
if I read one of yours

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
and you want to talk about it

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
herpe dick doesn't want to talk to anybody

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
what about this one

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
who writes I've never tasted my own cum

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
stand up

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
anybody

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
never tasted your own cum

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
Rob I know it's not you

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
it's not you

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
alright

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
they wrote it down

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
tastes like salt water

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
salt water

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
what do you mean what the hell

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
what do you think it tastes like

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
mine tastes like root beer

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
it smells like

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
paper mache

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
I feel like it tastes like salt water

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
I feel like this is dangerous

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
but I'm going to read it anyway

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
I regret being racist at the age of 5

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
after a black girl

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
ate my purple crayon

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
I had to be convinced by my mom

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
that quote not all black kids eat crayons

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
well I will say if you're why we're going

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
to mars to solve this

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
I will say if you're going to be racist

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
that's probably the best

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
stereotype keep it high

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
concept

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
they're just muppets

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
keep your purple crayons away from those people

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
these are adorable confessions

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
so far the cat and the driveway guy

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
and the herpy dick

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
or herpy titty

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
we don't know who this person was

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
I hate to

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
fan the flames

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
I one time told my Asian friend

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
to open her eyes

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
only to realize they were already open

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
I was like

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
is Andrew Dose Clay in the audience?

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
Bobby Slayton

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
if that really happened

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
then you were probably a kid

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
little kids are fascinated with each other's

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
differences in things

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
you touch each other's hair

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
you look at it and you go

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
why are your fingers different

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
it doesn't really register

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
on the level that we perceive

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
race is an artificial construct

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
people go oh you have freckles

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
you're taller than me

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
and what we call race

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
blends into that shit

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
until our parents get involved

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
and it's passed down from their parents

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
anyways

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
the obsession is trickling out

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
I'm 39 years old

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
I'm talking to a bunch of 25 year olds

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
you guys are already bored with me

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
being obsessed with race which is great

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
it's eroding away

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
I like it

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
if I walk into a playground

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
playing with each other it's different now

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
because some kids are different

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
some have different abilities

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
maybe you're better looking than others

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
maybe some get higher grades

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
why are you going around playgrounds looking for better looking kids

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
I'll tell you why

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
because I will fuck a kid

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
that's my confession

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
especially if he says

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
he'll do it again

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
they're just smooth

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
smooth

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
delicious

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
this is not a confession

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
maybe it is

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
when I was 12

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
I was on a highway to heaven episode

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
for those of you who don't know

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
thank you Rob

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
thank you for one person that's 40 in here

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
the TV show Michael Landon

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
where he played an angel and came down to earth

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
to solve people's little problems

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
he helped him out

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
without turning into the Hulk

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
less rope belts

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
let's flip over cars

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
but I played a kid that went to college

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
too young and was being

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
bossed around by my football playing roommate

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
who was using me to steal

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
computer like the answers

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
to tests and things like that

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
and so

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
I turned

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
32 or 3 maybe

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
at my computer

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
and somebody sends me a link to something

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
like hey check it out

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
and it's all these screen captures

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
of me when I was 12 on highway to heaven

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
but it's all the pictures of me with my shirt off

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
I'm like let's

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
I didn't put that together

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
wow it's all these pictures of me on this TV show

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
save that image

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
I look up at the URL at the top of the thing

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
and I'm like I'm going to erase all the information

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
of the JPEG

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
and the thing to find out what is this website

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
pedophile website

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
and it's

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
there's a link to blogs

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
it's all it's called forever 14

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
if I remember correctly

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
yeah guys check it out

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
search for Jeffrey Brian Davis

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
shirt off

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
forever 14 the home raisers

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
the pedophiles consider themselves

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
inyunganated

it's pictures of adult actors when they were young

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
and it's all these pictures of actors that were acting

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
when they were young and it's generally pictures

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
with them in a bathing suit

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
or with a shirt off or wet

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
it's raining out and the clothes are sticking to them

center

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
forever14.com

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
unless they give us some money

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
there's a link

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
to the forum part of it

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
which is like the conversations about it

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
and they had stopped in like

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
2002 or I don't know what it was

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
like 98

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
they stopped years before

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
right around your appearance on jump street

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
and your stubble came in

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
exactly yeah

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
past my prime

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
and there was conversations

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
like I think you could probably go to jail

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
for any of the things they were saying

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
because it's like hmm he's like the boy next door

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
I'd like to have him come over and mow my lawn

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
I'll teach him a thing or two

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
and I just felt this hand

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
I felt the sensation of someone walking up behind you

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
and putting a cold clammy hand on your shoulder

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
and I can't imagine what it's like

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
to be a woman no man possibly could

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
because it's too it's got because they have a hole

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
where their dick's supposed to be

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
I'm sorry I gotta take it easy

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
take it easy Nike

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
but like

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
women walking through a parking

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
structure at night

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
or getting in an elevator with guys

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
like that I felt for a moment

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
was like like oh like that's

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
like I just felt violated

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
by everything

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
at once and I felt very like

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
I felt very vulnerable and crazy

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
so it's just the worst

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
however little boys

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
hmm

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
hmm

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
hmm

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
hmm

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
hmm

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
hmm

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
hmm

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
hmm

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
hmm

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
hmm

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
hmm

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
hmm

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
hmm

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
hmm

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
hmm

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
hmm

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
hmm

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
hmm

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
hmm

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
hmm

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
hmm

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
hmm

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:46.500
I've never watched Community.

01:01:46.500 --> 01:01:54.000
This one might be the most revealing and shocking confession of them all, in its simplicity.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:02:00.000
I've heard a lot of people, but I feel worst about not feeling bad about any of it.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:05.000
Well, yeah, that's your sociopath, right?

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:09.000
And you know that, and you're afraid of getting caught, and that's the only thing that drives you.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:12.000
What's the most shameful thing you could say?

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:15.000
What's something that you would just be like?

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:18.000
I think it's closely related to that.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:24.000
I think the most shameful thing I could say is how little I care about other people's lives.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:30.000
I was in the bar tonight, and I saw that there was another fucking shooting, and I didn't know.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:35.000
We made comments about it, and we talked politically and psychologically about it.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:40.000
Dan and I met before the show, and it's that the shooting in the Sikh temple was at Wisconsin, was it?

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:45.000
Yeah, and it's just hot on the heels of that last asshole in the movie theater.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
It was my first response, of course.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
I'm from Wisconsin.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:54.000
And then we're talking about media coverage.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:59.000
We're talking about whether or not they should have given so much attention to the Joker guy.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:02.000
It's just me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:11.000
I don't know what we're supposed to do, get off our bar stools and run out in the street and stop traffic like in a Spike Lee movie and say,

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:15.000
Wake up! Everyone stop! We're humans.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:20.000
But I don't think that other people exist.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:23.000
That is my most shameful confession.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:33.000
I think that if you started to care that other people existed, you would get absorbed by them, and you would never be alive.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:41.000
But in some way, does that qualify you or disqualify you as someone that creates characters and writes shows about people and for people?

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:47.000
Halfway through your question, I started thinking about myself.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:52.000
Halfway through my question, I was thinking about little boys.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:56.000
I don't know. I confess that in the hopes that we all go through that.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:03.000
But I've known people like our friend Daniel Gillies, who's on Vampire Diaries, who before he was on Vampire Diaries,

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:08.000
heard about Katrina happening and jumped in his car and drove down to Katrina.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:18.000
And commandeered a bulldozer because Red Cross wouldn't let him have one because you have to go through all this rigamarole to actually be in a vehicle and helping people out.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:26.000
So he went to a neighborhood where nobody was helping, like one of the many neglected neighborhoods, and he just rented one?

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:31.000
I think he had to steal one because the government was like, you can't help people. You're not allowed to help.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:35.000
Helping people is worth a dollar. You have to go over to the line and get a helping people pen.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:42.000
Future Elijah from Vampire Diaries is this, oh, mate, I'm going to clean up this garbage man.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
He's Australian or Kiwi.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:48.000
It's not even his country, and he's like, fucking, people are drowning.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:52.000
He's like, Jeff, just watching the TV, and I was like, I can't just sit at home and watch.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:56.000
I'm like, I did. I could.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:00.000
I was like, whoa, flipping back and forth.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
What's Jerry Springer doing?

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:06.000
Yeah, that's my shameful confession is that I'm everything they want me to be.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:16.000
I'm a fucking breastfeeding baby on this tube that comes into your living room.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:20.000
That's one of those confessions, like the guy that confessed the cat thing.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:25.000
There were a couple of those where the thing was like, the real crime was like, when you're really confessing it, it's like,

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:33.000
and I don't believe that the confession helps because otherwise I would have confessed it a long time ago.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:39.000
A confession is something that you don't want to be true.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:44.000
And we're primates, so if you hide it long enough, it goes away.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:48.000
Cat shits on the carpet, dries, turns into crumbs, blows away in the wind.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:51.000
Take your shitty underwear and put it in the garbage.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:52.000
You never shit your pants.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
We forgot.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:55.000
You play with matches.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:56.000
Mom doesn't catch you.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:57.000
It never happened.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:00.000
You murder somebody, and the body goes away.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:03.000
You're not guilty.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:04.000
So confession is over.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
Here's the thing about confession.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:07.000
No fucking resolution.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:08.000
That's the thing.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:09.000
Okay?

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:10.000
Maybe that's how we slipped.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:11.000
I'm just stumbling into this.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
I took World History in 10th grade.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:18.000
The Catholic Church invented this concept of they would sell you absolution.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
Like, they put a dollar value on it.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:21.000
That would be my next step, as I would say.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
Write it down on the slip of paper.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:24.000
We'll read it out loud.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:25.000
Tell it to me or me alone.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:26.000
Give me a dollar.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Now it's done.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.000
Now it's over.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Now you didn't do it.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
Maybe that's not how confession works.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
Maybe confession just needs to happen.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:34.000
It just bubble it up.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:35.000
It just becomes a froth.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
Like a zit on your face.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
Blackhead turns into a whitehead.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
Maybe it stays painful.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:42.000
Maybe it festers.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:45.000
But maybe honesty stays the best policy.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:50.000
We confess stuff that doesn't lead to us not having done stuff.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:51.000
I'm still a shitty person.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
I shared it with you, though.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
It goes to the front of my brain.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:56.000
I don't know.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:57.000
So that's it.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
So now we move on to...

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Because this is important.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
I'm making this commitment.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:06.000
We've got the Harmontown.com website going up.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:09.000
I'm going to put on the Harmontown.com

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
sometime between now and the next show.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:14.000
I have to make sure that Jeff and I have rolled

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:17.000
first level Dungeons & Dragons characters.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:20.000
Advanced Dungeons & Dragons characters.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:24.000
I guess I have to specify first edition.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:27.000
Well, okay.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
Sorry, buddy.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
Somebody cried out in pain.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
Like a wolf trapped in a little...

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
The saddest confession of all.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
Well, okay.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
See, that already gets complicated.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:43.000
I grew up on just AD&D with the old school stuff.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:44.000
I don't know.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
So is anybody here...

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:49.000
Is somebody here like a Dungeons & Dragons kind of aficionado?

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:50.000
Alright.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:51.000
First hand to shoot up.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:54.000
Are you willing to come up here for just a second?

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
Just to answer some questions.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Let's welcome him to the stage.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
You all mean...

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
What is your name?

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:05.000
Spencer.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:06.000
Spencer, everybody.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Alright, that's already a good...

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:14.000
I got to admit, AD&D is a bit before my time, but I...

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
I get it, I get it.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:18.000
I've read the books.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
They just haven't played it too much.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:21.000
Well, that's why I called you up.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:24.000
So what has happened since 89?

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
Like, I...

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
Well, uh...

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
9-11 happened.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
Well, I didn't care.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:37.000
I just...

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:38.000
How many...

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
What edition of Dungeons & Dragons are we on?

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:43.000
Um, I think there's like fourth edition right now.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:44.000
Jesus Christ.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
Is it better than third?

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:47.000
Has it been getting better?

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
Um, third edition's probably better.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
Fourth edition's too easy.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:52.000
Does that make anyone angry?

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
It's really done down.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
Third edition's better than fourth?

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:57.000
Yeah, there's just...

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
Okay, I'm willing to take that as a quarrel.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:00.000
Alright, yeah, I love it.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:01.000
Thank you so much.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:02.000
Alright.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.000
Peace on my side.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:10.000
Spencer, would you be willing to generate first-level characters for Jeff Davis and me?

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:11.000
Uh, so that...

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:12.000
And then we'll put them on the line.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
So sometime, talk to...

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:15.000
Talk to us after the show.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:16.000
Yeah, no problem.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:17.000
So we will arrange you being able to upload them.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
Have you been a Dungeon Master before?

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
Yeah, I was like...

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:22.000
Before I was coming here.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:23.000
Hey, take it easy.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:24.000
Take it easy.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:25.000
He was...

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
We haven't started yet.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
I'll cast a magic missile.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
I don't even know what that is.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:32.000
Awesome.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:33.000
So you've done it before?

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
Yeah, no, I was just writing some stuff today actually.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Fucking yes.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
Hey, don't give him the fucking job.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:39.000
No, I'm saying...

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
I just need an audition.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:42.000
Yeah.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:43.000
You'll get an audition for sure.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
But who better to start with?

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:48.000
We'll inaugurate this new segment.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:49.000
We need characters.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:50.000
What is the end game?

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:53.000
We're going to try to find somebody that we actually want.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
We'll try out a handful of people.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:58.000
Yeah, we'll play like 15-minute segments with them.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:01.000
It's not that fair, but either is American Idol.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:05.000
I mean, Radiohead wouldn't win American Idol.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:08.000
You need to listen to a whole album before you realize they're worth it.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
Then we'll start playing D&D.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:14.000
Are you going to be Mitch Nightblade or whatever your name was?

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:24.000
I was close, wasn't I?

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:31.000
Spencer, if you could do us the honor of picking the race and class of the characters,

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
you don't have to name them.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
We'll name them.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:38.000
Rob Schraber's having a heart attack.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:43.000
So then part of our show next week is maybe you'll present the characters next week?

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:46.000
I have no idea what's going on. I'm all for it.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
I know I'm going to win.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:52.000
Come to next week's Harmontown with your satchels and your dice.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:56.000
I have a feeling there's a lot of Dungeon Masters out there in Los Angeles,

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:59.000
and I think all of them listen to this podcast.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
Yes, we do.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
I know all of them.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
All right, well, thank you, Spencer, for...

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:09.000
Spencer, everyone.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:13.000
I trust Spencer...

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:16.000
I trust Spencer to say third edition is the way to go.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
I don't know, man.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:21.000
When I was a kid, there were no editions.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:26.000
My Dungeon Masters guide had melted wax on the inside cover

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:29.000
and just all kinds of notes and maps,

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:32.000
because everyone felt like you were this close to worshiping the devil.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:36.000
It was punk rock. It was cool.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:40.000
All you people care about is fucking inception. That's all you care about.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
That's your Dungeons & Dragons.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
Because if you think about it...

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:48.000
No, if you think about it, a troll could be a paladin.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
That's mind-blowing.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:54.000
A dream and a dream. That's a six-year-old could say that.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
Oh, no.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
We're running wailing.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
I've never played Dungeons & Dragons.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:03.000
We had one abortive attempt to try to play it as a doll,

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:04.000
and it failed miserably.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
Who's the Dungeon Master? I'm the worst.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
It didn't work. We didn't like it.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:13.000
Also, I went out and played crappy pitch-and-putt golf with Matt Gorley yesterday,

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:16.000
and we invited you, but you were playing Minecraft,

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
which I also don't see the allure.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
It's the best. I can't explain that now.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
You're talking about another three-hour podcast.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
Thank you, sir.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
Minecraft.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
1.31.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
Was it Mitch Nightblade or something?

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:34.000
Jim Nightblade. I don't want to...

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
All right. We will see you next week.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
We're going to get this settled.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
Thank you for coming to Harmontown, everybody.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
You guys have been tremendous.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
Thank you for coming.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
Do you get the people to thank?

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
I can find it.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
Yeah, let's pull them up.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
I should have had that up.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
I can find it right now, the thank-yous.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
Hold up.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
Keep it down, Olivia Newton-John.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
All right. Thanks once again, everybody.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
We want to thank Katie Levine for audio recording.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
Zac McKeever, our tech...

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
Emily Gordon, producing the live show.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
Daniel Kramer, program director.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
Dustin Marshall, podcast producer.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
Mo Fatulbab, on-site director.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
And Jenny Fine, our fantastic artist.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
Thank you so much for coming to NerdMelt.
