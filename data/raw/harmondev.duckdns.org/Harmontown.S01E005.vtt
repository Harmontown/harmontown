{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:24.000\nHere you, here you, oh yes, oh yes, hey nani nani, welcome to Harmontown everybody, how are you tonight?\n\n00:24.000 --> 00:36.000\nAs cop-troller of Harmontown, I Jeff Davis officially declare this session of Harmontown to be in session\n\n00:36.000 --> 00:42.000\nLadies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon\n\n00:42.000 --> 01:01.000\nThank you, thank you, you're a good crowd, you're a good crowd, I don't say that every week, because they aren't always good crowd\n\n01:01.000 --> 01:05.000\nNo no, I won't get away with that lie anymore because we're on the internet now\n\n01:05.000 --> 01:16.000\nI am notoriously bad at opening shows, case in point, what I just did, what was that, but I want you to think of it as more of an evolution of performance on stage\n\n01:16.000 --> 01:31.000\nThe almighty mudskipper for instance, the link between fish and breathing reptile, well not a graceful entrance, but perhaps one of the most important things that ever happened\n\n01:31.000 --> 01:42.000\nA floundering, slimy, sweaty, gross thing, gasping for air in mud, think about it, next time you're about to judge somebody\n\n01:42.000 --> 01:47.000\nSo this show is flopping its way onto the shore of entertainment\n\n01:47.000 --> 01:56.000\nHere's another awkward transition to a greater world, maybe you heard of him, Jesus Christ\n\n01:56.000 --> 02:04.000\nDon't you feel a little bad about how you welcomed him? So I ask you again, are you having a good time tonight?\n\n02:04.000 --> 02:15.000\nI'm kidding, sorry, I don't even remember those people that leverages people emotionally, I didn't mean to do that\n\n02:15.000 --> 02:23.000\nThe theme of tonight is confession, if we're going to found a new colony as we will one day, I promise\n\n02:23.000 --> 02:29.000\nLet's talk about the Mars developments later, Jeff has a theory that I think is very important for him to confess\n\n02:29.000 --> 02:31.000\nWe'll get to this\n\n02:31.000 --> 02:39.000\nOr we won't, because we're both drunk and that segues me into what I think is the more important theme\n\n02:39.000 --> 02:45.000\nBut I'll just say to you later, if the show is dragging later, as opposed to now\n\n02:45.000 --> 02:49.000\nThis rocket ship that we're on right now\n\n02:49.000 --> 02:55.000\nWe see this look on our face that you may have sometimes seen where we're like, hey, hi, Jim Henson, why?\n\n02:55.000 --> 03:04.000\nFeel free to shout out Mars, and we'll get Jeff started on his obsessive theories about what's happening there right now\n\n03:04.000 --> 03:06.000\nI can stand by everything I think\n\n03:06.000 --> 03:10.000\nBut I want to start with the theme of confession, partly because our surprise guest tonight\n\n03:10.000 --> 03:15.000\nI think he's a good way to start things out and I want to get him out of here because he's doing us a favor\n\n03:15.000 --> 03:22.000\nI don't have a lot of guests anymore, I went on our following guests podcast live in San Francisco\n\n03:22.000 --> 03:26.000\nMonths and months and months ago during the comedy festival in San Francisco\n\n03:26.000 --> 03:34.000\nAnd they had some preamble to their podcast, there's four guys that host it, or maybe there was only two\n\n03:34.000 --> 03:40.000\nI don't know, I walked in pretty drunk\n\n03:40.000 --> 03:42.000\nAnd they all did stand up\n\n03:42.000 --> 03:48.000\nWhy were you that drunk? You knew that you were at a comedy festival, you're a professional\n\n03:48.000 --> 03:54.000\nWhy did you show up that drunk?\n\n03:54.000 --> 03:57.000\nThe show was on at eight and you just started drinking at two or what?\n\n03:57.000 --> 04:04.000\nI think it was on at, let's say it was on at nine and I got there at eight thirty, but then I wasn't on until midnight\n\n04:04.000 --> 04:06.000\nThat was part of my whole shtick\n\n04:06.000 --> 04:12.000\nIf you listen to the thing I come out and I'm like, you kept me waiting back there and I was doing a bit\n\n04:12.000 --> 04:20.000\nMy bag of tricks is like I go, I'm angry, it's a dumb bit, I just fall back on it\n\n04:20.000 --> 04:26.000\nMy dad hit me too much, I think it's funny to come out and go like, I was waiting backstage forever\n\n04:26.000 --> 04:32.000\nAnd then I started making fun of them for doing stand up, which precipitated me making fun of stand up in general\n\n04:32.000 --> 04:37.000\nWhich resulted in me over and over and over again, for those of you who are alcoholics\n\n04:37.000 --> 04:42.000\nYou know the first thing that goes out the window is your sense of overkill and timing\n\n04:42.000 --> 04:51.000\nYou become a six year old child who's just like, well this is funny, and if they stop laughing I'll just wait for them to remember how funny it is\n\n04:51.000 --> 04:54.000\nIt's called Harmontown\n\n04:54.000 --> 05:02.000\nI kept doing this joke over and over and over again where I was just doing a joke about jokes\n\n05:02.000 --> 05:08.000\nI was pretending to be a stand up and going, well black people are on a podcast like this, and white people are on a podcast like that\n\n05:08.000 --> 05:12.000\nAnd that reaction happened, the silence\n\n05:12.000 --> 05:17.000\nWhen I was growing up it was a big deal, you know, you point out the differences between black people and white people\n\n05:17.000 --> 05:20.000\nIt was very celebrated, very funny\n\n05:20.000 --> 05:24.000\nAnd I picked the wrong decade to lampoon that\n\n05:24.000 --> 05:28.000\nAnd I picked the wrong substance to lampoon it out, for all I know\n\n05:28.000 --> 05:30.000\nBut most of this is a blur to me\n\n05:30.000 --> 05:34.000\nThe important thing about tonight's story before I bring them up, this is how I want to introduce him\n\n05:34.000 --> 05:38.000\nBecause I barely know this guy, I was on his podcast once, I've met him twice\n\n05:38.000 --> 05:45.000\nHe was here last week because he was finishing a podcast upstairs here at Meltdown with John Crickfalussi\n\n05:45.000 --> 05:47.000\nAnd I happened to bump into him\n\n05:47.000 --> 05:51.000\nI haven't seen you since I ruined your podcast, why haven't you aired it?\n\n05:51.000 --> 05:58.000\nAnd I expected the answer to be, well because you're a big sloppy drunk shithead and you fucked up the whole thing and it's unarable\n\n05:58.000 --> 06:01.000\nWhich I would accept, but I would also be like, fuck you you prude\n\n06:01.000 --> 06:03.000\nIf that was his answer\n\n06:03.000 --> 06:10.000\nHis answer was, well, you know, by the time we started being ready to release it, that Chevy Chase thing happened\n\n06:10.000 --> 06:13.000\nAnd then that happened and we waited for that to cool out\n\n06:13.000 --> 06:20.000\nAnd then, like, you got fired and there was no point in time where I felt like, ah\n\n06:20.000 --> 06:23.000\nWe're doing this guy a big favor by airing this episode\n\n06:27.000 --> 06:31.000\nBut he said that, I was like, wow, you're a good guy\n\n06:31.000 --> 06:33.000\nWould you come up tonight? You want to be a guest thing?\n\n06:33.000 --> 06:35.000\nAnd I was like, dude, I know you have dinner plans\n\n06:35.000 --> 06:38.000\nHe's like, maybe next week, and he showed up tonight\n\n06:38.000 --> 06:41.000\nHe showed up in the green room and I said, how quick can we get you out of here?\n\n06:41.000 --> 06:43.000\nHe said, as quick as possible, and I've already betrayed him\n\n06:46.000 --> 06:48.000\nBut I wanted to make sure my introduction was fitting\n\n06:48.000 --> 06:51.000\nBecause I want you to know, because I don't know that much about him\n\n06:51.000 --> 06:55.000\nI only know that about him, which I think is a lot\n\n06:55.000 --> 06:58.000\nHe's a gentleman in a world without gentlemen\n\n06:58.000 --> 07:00.000\nI don't know what we're going to do with him\n\n07:00.000 --> 07:03.000\nLet's just talk to him, maybe tee off the theme of confession\n\n07:03.000 --> 07:06.000\nLadies and gentlemen, Doug Benson\n\n07:06.000 --> 07:10.000\nWhat?\n\n07:10.000 --> 07:13.000\nWow, sorry, what? I didn't know who it was\n\n07:13.000 --> 07:15.000\nI just presumed\n\n07:15.000 --> 07:18.000\nPlease welcome to what is basically his own stage, Chris Hardwick\n\n07:18.000 --> 07:19.000\nCome on, come on\n\n07:26.000 --> 07:27.000\nHey, hello Dan Harmon\n\n07:30.000 --> 07:34.000\nPussy fever, got pussy fever\n\n07:34.000 --> 07:36.000\nOh my god, thank god\n\n07:36.000 --> 07:41.000\nPussy fever, I don't want the cure\n\n07:41.000 --> 07:42.000\nIt's sad now\n\n07:42.000 --> 07:45.000\nThat's a thing from community, and it's so sad now\n\n07:49.000 --> 07:52.000\nYou should drop the song down into a minor key, so it's sad\n\n07:52.000 --> 07:55.000\nPussy fever\n\n07:55.000 --> 08:00.000\nWhen you research St. Patty's Day and you find out that the colours are moose\n\n08:00.000 --> 08:01.000\nPeople got slaughtered\n\n08:01.000 --> 08:05.000\nYou dig deep in any holiday and you find out some guy got hung upside down and eviscerated\n\n08:05.000 --> 08:08.000\nNow pussy fever is like the book Hot Zone\n\n08:08.000 --> 08:11.000\nWhere it's just like, everyone sits down\n\n08:11.000 --> 08:12.000\nI don't know what that means\n\n08:12.000 --> 08:14.000\nThat was the monkey book\n\n08:14.000 --> 08:16.000\nThat was a brave confession\n\n08:16.000 --> 08:18.000\nSee, we're confessing tonight\n\n08:18.000 --> 08:19.000\nThat's good\n\n08:19.000 --> 08:21.000\nThat was a nice long intro\n\n08:21.000 --> 08:23.000\nYes, the truth of the matter was\n\n08:23.000 --> 08:27.000\nI was worried that, because you were making fun of stand up\n\n08:27.000 --> 08:29.000\nWhich I know as a comedian\n\n08:29.000 --> 08:33.000\nAnd the audience was way on board with you at first\n\n08:36.000 --> 08:38.000\nAnd then, there's a point\n\n08:38.000 --> 08:41.000\nUntil I tried to introduce them to what I call the rule of 18s\n\n08:41.000 --> 08:46.000\nThe rule of 18s, which is 1 through 9, really funny\n\n08:46.000 --> 08:48.000\n10 through 15\n\n08:48.000 --> 08:52.000\nWow, and then 16, 17, 18, even more hilarious\n\n08:52.000 --> 08:54.000\nAndy Kaufman is reborn\n\n08:54.000 --> 08:57.000\nThis is a picture I took of you on stage\n\n08:57.000 --> 08:59.000\nIt's a picture of me, I look like a frog\n\n08:59.000 --> 09:03.000\nIt looks like Dan's drunk on the stage\n\n09:03.000 --> 09:10.000\nBasically, it looks like a toddler photograph from a Sears portrait studio\n\n09:10.000 --> 09:13.000\nBecause I was learning to walk\n\n09:13.000 --> 09:16.000\nAnd this is where you were like, grinding\n\n09:16.000 --> 09:17.000\nI was humping the stage\n\n09:17.000 --> 09:21.000\nYou were grinding your junk into the stage going, bag people do this\n\n09:21.000 --> 09:23.000\nAnd white people do this\n\n09:23.000 --> 09:28.000\nAnd there was no subject\n\n09:28.000 --> 09:33.000\nAnd so, at a certain point, a couple of people were like, hey\n\n09:33.000 --> 09:36.000\nAnd I just didn't, it was not at all about race\n\n09:36.000 --> 09:38.000\nNothing you were doing was actually about race\n\n09:38.000 --> 09:41.000\nBut I just didn't, when the Chevy thing broke\n\n09:41.000 --> 09:44.000\nI didn't want it to be another TMZ or someone goes\n\n09:44.000 --> 09:46.000\nAnd look at this offensive thing he's doing over there\n\n09:46.000 --> 09:48.000\nThis guy is full of stuff\n\n09:48.000 --> 09:52.000\nI had become Charlie Sheen for a most exhilarating three weeks of my life\n\n09:52.000 --> 09:55.000\nI was Charlie Sheen, on a very minor scale\n\n09:55.000 --> 09:57.000\nAnd if people don't get weird\n\n09:57.000 --> 10:00.000\nI just didn't want people to make it about something that it was never about\n\n10:00.000 --> 10:02.000\nIt was about you making fun of us\n\n10:02.000 --> 10:05.000\nBecause he came out, you didn't go on a midnight\n\n10:05.000 --> 10:07.000\nBut it wasn't early\n\n10:07.000 --> 10:10.000\nSo, okay, maybe we have some contention here\n\n10:10.000 --> 10:15.000\nI think I was waiting back there long enough to drink two bottles of Grey Goose\n\n10:15.000 --> 10:17.000\nThat's how I measure time\n\n10:17.000 --> 10:22.000\nI don't know\n\n10:22.000 --> 10:26.000\nSo we, you know, we did stand up up top of the show\n\n10:26.000 --> 10:28.000\nAnd then you came out\n\n10:28.000 --> 10:30.000\nAnd I love that you were making fun of us\n\n10:30.000 --> 10:31.000\nAnd you were making fun of standard\n\n10:31.000 --> 10:33.000\nIt was such a great dynamic on the show\n\n10:33.000 --> 10:36.000\nBut we always want people to feel like, you know, fun\n\n10:36.000 --> 10:38.000\nAnd celebrated and positive and supportive\n\n10:38.000 --> 10:39.000\nBut I'm also safe\n\n10:39.000 --> 10:40.000\nAnd safe\n\n10:40.000 --> 10:43.000\nAnd you just didn't want, you know, I just didn't want the wrong person\n\n10:43.000 --> 10:47.000\nTo take something that they read in a headline out of context and say\n\n10:47.000 --> 10:48.000\nOh, that Dan Harmon did this\n\n10:48.000 --> 10:50.000\nAnd he's like, no, you weren't there\n\n10:50.000 --> 10:51.000\nHe wasn't about that at all\n\n10:51.000 --> 10:52.000\nAnd so that's all\n\n10:52.000 --> 10:53.000\nIt was just sort of like\n\n10:53.000 --> 10:55.000\nThat's what my story is\n\n10:55.000 --> 10:57.000\nIt doesn't even matter if you're right or wrong\n\n10:57.000 --> 11:00.000\nThe fact that that's the diamond loop you have in your eye\n\n11:00.000 --> 11:01.000\nWhen you're looking at anything\n\n11:01.000 --> 11:05.000\nMakes you one of the last true gentlemen in a horrible wasteland\n\n11:05.000 --> 11:07.000\nReally, we're all eating each other\n\n11:07.000 --> 11:10.000\nI mean, I would like to think I would also, the thought\n\n11:10.000 --> 11:12.000\nThat thought would also cross my mind\n\n11:12.000 --> 11:13.000\nI don't know\n\n11:13.000 --> 11:15.000\nBut I was like, I was just astounded\n\n11:15.000 --> 11:18.000\nIt was like, I did not expect to hear that coming out of your mouth\n\n11:18.000 --> 11:19.000\nI really don't know you\n\n11:19.000 --> 11:22.000\nAnd for you to extend me that courtesy\n\n11:22.000 --> 11:26.000\nI expected to see a guy ride by on a giant bicycle\n\n11:26.000 --> 11:31.000\nI felt like we were in an era where you put your pinky out when you drank\n\n11:31.000 --> 11:33.000\nAnd you put a cape over the thing\n\n11:33.000 --> 11:35.000\nIt seemed like second nature to you\n\n11:35.000 --> 11:37.000\nYou had enough problems going on back then\n\n11:37.000 --> 11:39.000\nYeah, I just didn't want to end that\n\n11:39.000 --> 11:43.000\nBut the truth of the matter is the audio on live shows is very, very difficult\n\n11:43.000 --> 11:45.000\nWe do get a lot of complaints on that\n\n11:45.000 --> 11:48.000\nBecause we set, you know, four mics are set on the table\n\n11:48.000 --> 11:50.000\nAnd people lean back, people lean forward\n\n11:50.000 --> 11:52.000\nYou know, the audience's mics separately\n\n11:52.000 --> 11:56.000\nAnd audio levels on live shows are just very hard to normalize\n\n11:56.000 --> 11:58.000\nSo that was actually the other issue\n\n11:58.000 --> 12:00.000\nSo it really was a couple of things\n\n12:00.000 --> 12:02.000\nBut it was a really fun show and I'm glad that you did it\n\n12:02.000 --> 12:03.000\nAnd we'll have you back on\n\n12:03.000 --> 12:07.000\nAlso, racism levels are hard to normalize too\n\n12:07.000 --> 12:08.000\nI don't know\n\n12:08.000 --> 12:16.000\nIt's also hard on a podcast to really get the sensation of a white man humping a stage\n\n12:16.000 --> 12:22.000\nSupposedly lampooning something while inventing a new art form himself\n\n12:22.000 --> 12:25.000\nWell, yeah, I mean, I think people here know, but it's a classic\n\n12:25.000 --> 12:27.000\nIt's sort of a classic stand-up\n\n12:27.000 --> 12:29.000\nYou know, when you're making fun of stand-up comedy\n\n12:29.000 --> 12:31.000\nYou say things like, men and women are like this\n\n12:31.000 --> 12:33.000\nAnd San Francisco and New York are like this\n\n12:33.000 --> 12:35.000\nAnd flying is like this\n\n12:35.000 --> 12:36.000\nAnd black people do this\n\n12:36.000 --> 12:39.000\nThe Simpsons have the classic, you know\n\n12:39.000 --> 12:40.000\nBlack people drive a car like this\n\n12:40.000 --> 12:42.000\nDude, dude, dude, you know, white people are like\n\n12:42.000 --> 12:44.000\nAnd classic is the important word\n\n12:44.000 --> 12:46.000\nI was doing it 20 years after everyone already got the joke\n\n12:46.000 --> 12:48.000\nYeah, yeah, yeah\n\n12:48.000 --> 12:51.000\nIt's that one Simpsons episode where Homer's on the couch and he's watching\n\n12:51.000 --> 12:54.000\nAnd he's like, it's true, we're so lame or whatever\n\n12:54.000 --> 12:56.000\nAnd it's like, and they made, you know, like they\n\n12:56.000 --> 13:00.000\nSo that is a classic stand-up, making fun of stand-up joke\n\n13:00.000 --> 13:03.000\nBut I just didn't want people to misconstrue what it was actually about\n\n13:03.000 --> 13:04.000\nWell, I thought it was amazing\n\n13:04.000 --> 13:06.000\nMy philosophy is, I got drunk, went on your show\n\n13:06.000 --> 13:08.000\nAnd said stuff into a recorder\n\n13:08.000 --> 13:13.000\nAlso, I'm currently famous for playing a guy's voicemail into a thing\n\n13:13.000 --> 13:16.000\nI don't think you can go ahead, let it loose\n\n13:16.000 --> 13:18.000\nMy deals are closed with CBS and Fox\n\n13:18.000 --> 13:22.000\nMy favorite part about how druggy was that came out\n\n13:22.000 --> 13:24.000\nYou were like, you would talk for a second\n\n13:24.000 --> 13:26.000\nAnd you were like, yeah, you know, Heat Vision and Jack would\n\n13:26.000 --> 13:30.000\nI am so drunk and it is your fault\n\n13:30.000 --> 13:33.000\nIt is your motherfucking fault that I am this drunk\n\n13:33.000 --> 13:36.000\nI've been backstage for five hours\n\n13:36.000 --> 13:39.000\nIt wasn't really five hours, but it must have felt like it\n\n13:39.000 --> 13:42.000\nBut I do have to apologize, we should not have all done stand-up\n\n13:42.000 --> 13:45.000\nBefore you came out, we should have just brought you out\n\n13:45.000 --> 13:50.000\nWell, you shouldn't have met Myra Headline\n\n13:50.000 --> 13:53.000\nI just said that to get a laugh and it didn't get enough of it\n\n13:53.000 --> 13:56.000\nNo, are we going to get a confession out of Chris?\n\n13:56.000 --> 13:57.000\nYeah, yeah, yeah, that's what it was about\n\n13:57.000 --> 13:59.000\nI said to you backstage, because here's the other thing about Chris\n\n13:59.000 --> 14:01.000\nI don't know how public it is and how much it is\n\n14:01.000 --> 14:05.000\nBut I know that my girlfriend, after I did this, after I did this debacle\n\n14:05.000 --> 14:09.000\nIt was after that that my girlfriend, Erin, who came to San Francisco\n\n14:09.000 --> 14:11.000\nWith me and watched this whole thing\n\n14:11.000 --> 14:15.000\nShe was like, you know, part of that might have been a little bit of this\n\n14:15.000 --> 14:19.000\nYou know, Chris is sober, he used to drink\n\n14:19.000 --> 14:20.000\nNow he doesn't anymore\n\n14:20.000 --> 14:23.000\nAnd people that used to drink and now don't anymore\n\n14:23.000 --> 14:27.000\nLike a good 85% of them are pretty uncomfortable around people\n\n14:27.000 --> 14:30.000\nNo, no, no, it's a good reminder that I made the right choice\n\n14:30.000 --> 14:33.000\nYeah, that's how I'd think of it\n\n14:33.000 --> 14:35.000\nThat's how I'd assume\n\n14:35.000 --> 14:37.000\nNo, no, no, I don't care\n\n14:37.000 --> 14:39.000\nI've been sober for nine years\n\n14:39.000 --> 14:40.000\nI don't even remember\n\n14:40.000 --> 14:44.000\nI have flashes of like, oh yeah, I used to be that\n\n14:44.000 --> 14:48.000\nI've now ponded off on, I had this fat brother named Peter\n\n14:48.000 --> 14:49.000\nAnd he used to fuck shit up\n\n14:49.000 --> 14:51.000\nI don't even take responsibility for it anymore\n\n14:53.000 --> 14:56.000\nBut I thought, because tonight's theme is confessions\n\n14:56.000 --> 14:57.000\nWe're having to come up\n\n14:57.000 --> 14:59.000\nAnd I'm confessing that I ruined your podcast\n\n14:59.000 --> 15:01.000\nAnd I did it because I'm an alcoholic asshole\n\n15:01.000 --> 15:02.000\nNo, no, no, it wasn't\n\n15:02.000 --> 15:03.000\nAnd you're a great stand-up guy\n\n15:03.000 --> 15:04.000\nNo, no\n\n15:04.000 --> 15:07.000\nI was wondering if you, in the green room I said\n\n15:07.000 --> 15:10.000\nLike, maybe in classic sober fashion\n\n15:10.000 --> 15:13.000\nMaybe you have a confession\n\n15:13.000 --> 15:17.000\nA couple drunken, I can give you a couple drunk confessions\n\n15:17.000 --> 15:20.000\nOne is sort of a cool story, bro\n\n15:20.000 --> 15:21.000\nBecause it doesn't really go anywhere\n\n15:21.000 --> 15:27.000\nBut in 2001, I went to London and I was visiting\n\n15:27.000 --> 15:29.000\nI just went to London for a couple weeks\n\n15:29.000 --> 15:31.000\nBecause you can literally drink everywhere in London\n\n15:31.000 --> 15:32.000\nLike, you can drink in museums\n\n15:32.000 --> 15:33.000\nYou can drink in zoos\n\n15:33.000 --> 15:35.000\nLike, everywhere, it just has alcohol\n\n15:35.000 --> 15:37.000\nAnd they think it's adorable and charming\n\n15:37.000 --> 15:39.000\nAnd so when I started to know I had a problem\n\n15:39.000 --> 15:41.000\nI was like, wow, I really fit in here\n\n15:41.000 --> 15:43.000\nLike, I knew I had a problem\n\n15:43.000 --> 15:46.000\nAnd because I was just all about it all the time\n\n15:46.000 --> 15:50.000\nAnd Zach Alfenakis was out there shooting a submarine movie\n\n15:50.000 --> 15:51.000\nCalled Below\n\n15:51.000 --> 15:53.000\nAnd so I stayed with him for a couple days\n\n15:53.000 --> 15:55.000\nAnd we went out one night\n\n15:55.000 --> 15:57.000\nAnd he was with these, the other actors in the movie\n\n15:57.000 --> 16:00.000\nWere these like pretty schmancy British actor types\n\n16:00.000 --> 16:03.000\nAnd so we went to all these underground British clubs\n\n16:03.000 --> 16:05.000\nAnd I got really fucking drunk\n\n16:05.000 --> 16:07.000\nAnd at about 3 a.m. somewhere in London\n\n16:07.000 --> 16:10.000\nI tried to hit on Bjork\n\n16:13.000 --> 16:14.000\nAlright\n\n16:14.000 --> 16:15.000\nGot it\n\n16:15.000 --> 16:18.000\nThat headline works in tabloid format\n\n16:18.000 --> 16:20.000\nWith an exclamation point\n\n16:20.000 --> 16:21.000\nI tried to hit on Bjork\n\n16:21.000 --> 16:22.000\nI tried to hit on Bjork\n\n16:22.000 --> 16:26.000\nCan you, what was your first move?\n\n16:26.000 --> 16:29.000\nMy first move was staring at her for an hour and a half\n\n16:29.000 --> 16:30.000\nRight?\n\n16:30.000 --> 16:31.000\nThat's actually good\n\n16:31.000 --> 16:33.000\nBecause she's fascinated by fire hydrants\n\n16:33.000 --> 16:34.000\nShe is\n\n16:36.000 --> 16:38.000\nShe probably mythologized you\n\n16:38.000 --> 16:40.000\nYes, whenever she speaks this weird subtitle\n\n16:40.000 --> 16:43.000\nWith a brush script font appears\n\n16:46.000 --> 16:50.000\nAnd so, you know, I was basically just like this\n\n16:50.000 --> 16:52.000\nI must have felt like it was like 10 minutes\n\n16:52.000 --> 16:54.000\nBut it really was like an hour and a half\n\n16:54.000 --> 16:56.000\nAnd so Zach and all these other, all of his\n\n16:56.000 --> 16:58.000\nSchmancy British actor friends were like\n\n16:58.000 --> 17:00.000\nYeah, cause it's alright if we go\n\n17:00.000 --> 17:02.000\nAnd I'm like, no man, I'm only going to make my move\n\n17:02.000 --> 17:04.000\nI'm going to hit on Bjork\n\n17:04.000 --> 17:07.000\nAnd she was talking to some other people\n\n17:07.000 --> 17:09.000\nAnd then finally\n\n17:09.000 --> 17:10.000\nThey were ready to leave\n\n17:10.000 --> 17:12.000\nAnd I'm like, okay, I'm going to do it\n\n17:12.000 --> 17:13.000\nAnd so I walk up to her\n\n17:13.000 --> 17:14.000\nAnd I tap her on the shoulder\n\n17:14.000 --> 17:16.000\nAnd she turns around like this\n\n17:16.000 --> 17:19.000\nYou know, just looking all Bjorky\n\n17:19.000 --> 17:24.000\nAnd I'm like\n\n17:24.000 --> 17:26.000\nLike I take the breath in\n\n17:26.000 --> 17:27.000\nTo go to ask her a question\n\n17:27.000 --> 17:28.000\nAnd she sees me\n\n17:28.000 --> 17:29.000\nAnd immediately just turns around\n\n17:29.000 --> 17:30.000\nAnd scampers up\n\n17:30.000 --> 17:32.000\nShe may have disappeared\n\n17:32.000 --> 17:33.000\nIn a pile of dust\n\n17:33.000 --> 17:34.000\nOr been swallowed by the earth\n\n17:34.000 --> 17:35.000\nI'm not 100% sure\n\n17:35.000 --> 17:36.000\nShe's from Iceland\n\n17:36.000 --> 17:37.000\nShe knows when she's getting a puke done\n\n17:42.000 --> 17:45.000\nShe's turned into a pile of fire salts\n\n17:45.000 --> 17:46.000\nAnd I don't know what happened\n\n17:46.000 --> 17:47.000\nSo you never even had a conversation with her\n\n17:47.000 --> 17:49.000\nAnd it was such a failure\n\n17:49.000 --> 17:52.000\nAnd then she immediately started talking\n\n17:52.000 --> 17:53.000\nTo some other guy\n\n17:53.000 --> 17:56.000\nSo I have to walk with all these people\n\n17:56.000 --> 17:58.000\nWho I'd been making wait forever\n\n17:58.000 --> 18:01.000\nFor this utter moment of failure\n\n18:01.000 --> 18:04.000\nAnd we end up going back and hanging out\n\n18:04.000 --> 18:05.000\nAnd I was sitting on the bed\n\n18:05.000 --> 18:07.000\nAnd Zack videotaped me\n\n18:07.000 --> 18:10.000\nBeing really bummed that I totally\n\n18:10.000 --> 18:12.000\nStruck out with Bjork\n\n18:12.000 --> 18:14.000\nAnd I'm like\n\n18:14.000 --> 18:15.000\nAre you saying her by name?\n\n18:15.000 --> 18:16.000\nYeah, I'm saying her by name\n\n18:16.000 --> 18:17.000\nAnd I'm like Bjork\n\n18:17.000 --> 18:18.000\nAnd then she\n\n18:18.000 --> 18:19.000\nI think I said like\n\n18:19.000 --> 18:21.000\nAnd then this other guy showed up\n\n18:21.000 --> 18:23.000\nHe totally cock-bjorked me\n\n18:27.000 --> 18:29.000\nWhich I really said that\n\n18:29.000 --> 18:31.000\nBut I was genuinely bummed\n\n18:31.000 --> 18:34.000\nThat in my drunken state of mind\n\n18:34.000 --> 18:36.000\nThat I had this moment\n\n18:36.000 --> 18:38.000\nThat it was a total failure\n\n18:38.000 --> 18:39.000\nLike I would have had any chance\n\n18:39.000 --> 18:40.000\nWell this brings to mind\n\n18:40.000 --> 18:42.000\nThis is something that I constantly want to ask\n\n18:42.000 --> 18:44.000\nAnd I have probably the coolest sober person\n\n18:44.000 --> 18:46.000\nI've ever talked to\n\n18:46.000 --> 18:47.000\nIn my life up here\n\n18:47.000 --> 18:49.000\nSo this is a perfect time to ask this\n\n18:49.000 --> 18:50.000\nI hear that story\n\n18:50.000 --> 18:51.000\nPerfect example\n\n18:51.000 --> 18:52.000\nI go\n\n18:52.000 --> 18:54.000\nSo why aren't you still drinking?\n\n18:54.000 --> 18:56.000\nWhat's wrong with that?\n\n18:56.000 --> 18:57.000\nYou gotta give\n\n18:57.000 --> 18:59.000\nYou gotta fucking get back on the Bjork saddle\n\n18:59.000 --> 19:00.000\nAnd fucking\n\n19:00.000 --> 19:01.000\nWell I mean\n\n19:01.000 --> 19:02.000\nThere's other Bjorks\n\n19:02.000 --> 19:03.000\nI talked to other people\n\n19:03.000 --> 19:04.000\nAnd they go\n\n19:04.000 --> 19:05.000\nLike yeah I woke up in a puddle of blood\n\n19:05.000 --> 19:06.000\nAnd I kept doing that\n\n19:06.000 --> 19:07.000\nThird time I did it\n\n19:07.000 --> 19:08.000\nYeah you gotta stop waking up\n\n19:08.000 --> 19:09.000\nIn puddles of blood\n\n19:09.000 --> 19:10.000\nWell no\n\n19:10.000 --> 19:11.000\nYou get a dark one\n\n19:11.000 --> 19:12.000\nDon't think of it as a comedy show\n\n19:12.000 --> 19:14.000\nGive us a second one\n\n19:14.000 --> 19:16.000\nAnd then I'll let you go to dinner with the\n\n19:16.000 --> 19:17.000\nWith Bjork\n\n19:17.000 --> 19:19.000\nA dark one\n\n19:19.000 --> 19:20.000\nYou know it wasn't\n\n19:20.000 --> 19:21.000\nIt wasn't just that there was like\n\n19:21.000 --> 19:23.000\nIt wasn't any specifically\n\n19:23.000 --> 19:25.000\nThat any one thing happened\n\n19:25.000 --> 19:26.000\nIt's just when I look back\n\n19:26.000 --> 19:27.000\nAt what my life was like back then\n\n19:27.000 --> 19:29.000\nI had been on MTV in the 90s\n\n19:29.000 --> 19:31.000\nAnd there was this sort of unspoken curse\n\n19:31.000 --> 19:32.000\nLike well if you're on MTV\n\n19:32.000 --> 19:33.000\nLike that's it\n\n19:33.000 --> 19:34.000\nYou know\n\n19:34.000 --> 19:36.000\nLike you probably won't do anything else after that\n\n19:36.000 --> 19:38.000\nCause a lot of people didn't\n\n19:38.000 --> 19:40.000\nAnd the business was less forgiving\n\n19:40.000 --> 19:42.000\nBack then for crossing over\n\n19:42.000 --> 19:43.000\nLike if you were a VJ\n\n19:43.000 --> 19:44.000\nIf you're on MTV it was like\n\n19:44.000 --> 19:45.000\nYeah you know\n\n19:45.000 --> 19:47.000\nSort of like being what people consider\n\n19:47.000 --> 19:49.000\nLike being an internet personality now\n\n19:49.000 --> 19:51.000\nYou know and someday that'll change\n\n19:51.000 --> 19:53.000\nOr it's in the process of changing\n\n19:53.000 --> 19:55.000\nAnd so I just\n\n19:55.000 --> 19:57.000\nI was like chunky\n\n19:57.000 --> 19:58.000\nAnd blotchy\n\n19:58.000 --> 20:00.000\nAnd I wasn't working\n\n20:00.000 --> 20:02.000\nAnd I think I just kind of looked at the\n\n20:02.000 --> 20:04.000\nSort of like here's the landscape of my life\n\n20:04.000 --> 20:06.000\nI can keep doing this\n\n20:06.000 --> 20:07.000\nWhich would be fine\n\n20:07.000 --> 20:08.000\nYou know like I wasn't\n\n20:08.000 --> 20:10.000\nI never had to go to the hospital\n\n20:10.000 --> 20:12.000\nWell except for one time\n\n20:12.000 --> 20:13.000\nI jumped over a wall\n\n20:13.000 --> 20:15.000\nAnd like fucked up my foot\n\n20:15.000 --> 20:16.000\nLike that was it\n\n20:16.000 --> 20:17.000\nAnd I was also fat\n\n20:17.000 --> 20:18.000\nAnd I had these leather pants\n\n20:18.000 --> 20:20.000\nIt was really embarrassing\n\n20:20.000 --> 20:22.000\nI just never wear leather\n\n20:22.000 --> 20:23.000\nNo one\n\n20:23.000 --> 20:25.000\nWere you fat and in leather pants\n\n20:25.000 --> 20:27.000\nWhen you tried to pick up Bjork?\n\n20:27.000 --> 20:29.000\nYes I was as a matter of fact\n\n20:29.000 --> 20:30.000\nAnd I think\n\n20:30.000 --> 20:31.000\nJeff put it together\n\n20:31.000 --> 20:32.000\nAnd you know what\n\n20:32.000 --> 20:33.000\nYou know what\n\n20:33.000 --> 20:36.000\nI think in my drunken mind\n\n20:36.000 --> 20:38.000\nI'm like I'm just like Jim Morrison\n\n20:38.000 --> 20:40.000\nYou know like this fucking fat guy\n\n20:40.000 --> 20:42.000\nWith leather pants\n\n20:42.000 --> 20:44.000\nOne day some hot girls\n\n20:44.000 --> 20:45.000\nGonna blow me in an elevator\n\n20:45.000 --> 20:47.000\nAnd that never happened\n\n20:47.000 --> 20:49.000\nThat never ever ever happened\n\n20:49.000 --> 20:51.000\nAnd so I think I just\n\n20:51.000 --> 20:52.000\nYou know I just kind of\n\n20:52.000 --> 20:54.000\nThe truthfully like sincerely\n\n20:54.000 --> 20:55.000\nI just could have got to a point\n\n20:55.000 --> 20:57.000\nIt wasn't anything specifically bad happened\n\n20:57.000 --> 20:59.000\nBut just a period of my life\n\n20:59.000 --> 21:00.000\nWas just sort of like a dark ages\n\n21:00.000 --> 21:02.000\nWhere nothing really moved forward\n\n21:02.000 --> 21:03.000\nAnd it just kind of kept getting\n\n21:03.000 --> 21:04.000\nWorse and worse\n\n21:04.000 --> 21:05.000\nAnd I just thought\n\n21:05.000 --> 21:07.000\nYou know right when I was about 30, 31\n\n21:07.000 --> 21:08.000\nI was like you know\n\n21:08.000 --> 21:09.000\nI can stay on this path\n\n21:09.000 --> 21:10.000\nAnd that's fine\n\n21:10.000 --> 21:11.000\nI'm not gonna\n\n21:11.000 --> 21:13.000\nI don't black out drunk\n\n21:13.000 --> 21:15.000\nBut nothing else really substantial\n\n21:15.000 --> 21:17.000\nIs probably really gonna happen in my life\n\n21:17.000 --> 21:18.000\nBut I also realized\n\n21:18.000 --> 21:21.000\nWow I have this crazy ability\n\n21:21.000 --> 21:23.000\nTo focus on something\n\n21:23.000 --> 21:25.000\nLike I'm clearly addicted to alcohol\n\n21:25.000 --> 21:28.000\nSo you know what if I could refocus that\n\n21:28.000 --> 21:30.000\nYou know so like there was this idea\n\n21:30.000 --> 21:32.000\nOf maybe I could take this demon that I had\n\n21:32.000 --> 21:34.000\nAnd figure out how to spin it\n\n21:34.000 --> 21:35.000\nIn a way where I could use it\n\n21:35.000 --> 21:37.000\nInstead of denying that I had it\n\n21:37.000 --> 21:38.000\nSo I did you know I go on\n\n21:38.000 --> 21:39.000\nOkay\n\n21:39.000 --> 21:42.000\nAs Jeff goes to the vodka bucket\n\n21:42.000 --> 21:44.000\nAnd so you know I did\n\n21:44.000 --> 21:46.000\nAnd then when I quit\n\n21:46.000 --> 21:47.000\nThen I realized like\n\n21:47.000 --> 21:48.000\nOh yeah I had all these problems\n\n21:48.000 --> 21:49.000\nThat I wasn't dealing with\n\n21:49.000 --> 21:50.000\nAnd then you know\n\n21:50.000 --> 21:51.000\nThere was a little period where I\n\n21:51.000 --> 21:54.000\nWhere I had to you know fix the brain\n\n21:54.000 --> 21:55.000\nEvery conversation I had with people\n\n21:55.000 --> 21:57.000\nLike the first question is\n\n21:57.000 --> 21:58.000\nAre you an alcoholic\n\n21:58.000 --> 22:01.000\nI immediately I can't say yes fast enough\n\n22:01.000 --> 22:03.000\nThe reason is because\n\n22:03.000 --> 22:04.000\nI caught on to the game\n\n22:04.000 --> 22:06.000\nIf you say no you're an alcoholic\n\n22:06.000 --> 22:07.000\nRight\n\n22:07.000 --> 22:08.000\nOh yeah some people will\n\n22:08.000 --> 22:09.000\nLike oh you're in denial huh\n\n22:09.000 --> 22:11.000\nYou're like but you didn't even give me the\n\n22:11.000 --> 22:13.000\nYeah I just clicked the blue wire\n\n22:13.000 --> 22:14.000\nRight away\n\n22:14.000 --> 22:16.000\nI don't care if it blows up or\n\n22:16.000 --> 22:17.000\nIt diffuses the bomb but\n\n22:17.000 --> 22:19.000\nI'm not gonna stand there and go\n\n22:19.000 --> 22:20.000\nThere you go\n\n22:20.000 --> 22:22.000\nIt sounds like an alcoholic to me\n\n22:24.000 --> 22:28.000\nBecause 85% of everyone is a dick\n\n22:28.000 --> 22:31.000\nYeah 85% of all drunks are dicks\n\n22:31.000 --> 22:33.000\nAnd 85% of all sober people are dicks\n\n22:33.000 --> 22:35.000\nAnd you meet less sober people\n\n22:35.000 --> 22:36.000\nThan you meet drunks\n\n22:36.000 --> 22:37.000\nSo if you're drunk\n\n22:37.000 --> 22:38.000\nAnd you meet a sober person\n\n22:38.000 --> 22:40.000\n85% chance you're gonna have\n\n22:40.000 --> 22:41.000\nA fucking bad time\n\n22:41.000 --> 22:43.000\nBecause you don't meet that many\n\n22:43.000 --> 22:45.000\nAnd 85% of them are dicks\n\n22:45.000 --> 22:48.000\nAnd a sober dick is somebody\n\n22:48.000 --> 22:50.000\nWho gets as much identity\n\n22:50.000 --> 22:53.000\nFrom being sober as a drunk\n\n22:53.000 --> 22:54.000\nGets out of being drunk\n\n22:54.000 --> 22:56.000\nLike you met them when you were drunk\n\n22:56.000 --> 22:57.000\nYou met them when they were drunk\n\n22:57.000 --> 22:59.000\nLike alcohol was their life\n\n22:59.000 --> 23:00.000\nI'm a drunk\n\n23:00.000 --> 23:01.000\nI love being drunk\n\n23:01.000 --> 23:02.000\nLet's drink\n\n23:03.000 --> 23:05.000\nAnd then they find Jesus\n\n23:05.000 --> 23:06.000\nOr they get sober\n\n23:06.000 --> 23:07.000\nAnd then it's like\n\n23:07.000 --> 23:08.000\nI'm sober\n\n23:08.000 --> 23:09.000\nAre you sober?\n\n23:09.000 --> 23:10.000\nI'm sober\n\n23:10.000 --> 23:11.000\nYoung people talk like this\n\n23:11.000 --> 23:12.000\nSober people talk\n\n23:19.000 --> 23:21.000\nBut I never knew you were sober\n\n23:21.000 --> 23:24.000\nI walked into your life\n\n23:24.000 --> 23:26.000\nPissed on your stage\n\n23:26.000 --> 23:30.000\nRaped your dog\n\n23:30.000 --> 23:31.000\nDid a shot of Fernette Bronca\n\n23:31.000 --> 23:32.000\nWalked out\n\n23:32.000 --> 23:33.000\nAnd then someone else told me\n\n23:33.000 --> 23:34.000\nYou know, he's sober\n\n23:34.000 --> 23:35.000\nOh, but I don't really\n\n23:35.000 --> 23:36.000\nIt never bothers me\n\n23:36.000 --> 23:37.000\nBecause I don't, you know\n\n23:37.000 --> 23:39.000\nI'm definitely not someone\n\n23:39.000 --> 23:40.000\nWho looks around everyone\n\n23:40.000 --> 23:41.000\nAnd they're like\n\n23:41.000 --> 23:42.000\nThat person should probably\n\n23:42.000 --> 23:43.000\nI have my problems\n\n23:43.000 --> 23:45.000\nOther people have their own path\n\n23:45.000 --> 23:46.000\nI just don't fucking\n\n23:46.000 --> 23:47.000\nYou know, like\n\n23:47.000 --> 23:49.000\nThat's just how it is for me\n\n23:49.000 --> 23:50.000\nI just don't tell people\n\n23:50.000 --> 23:52.000\nI don't judge people that way\n\n23:52.000 --> 23:55.000\nAlright, how do you judge people?\n\n23:55.000 --> 23:56.000\nAlright\n\n23:59.000 --> 24:00.000\nDo you want to plug anything\n\n24:00.000 --> 24:02.000\nOr you don't need to\n\n24:02.000 --> 24:03.000\nYou're King Kong\n\n24:03.000 --> 24:04.000\nNo, no, no, no, no\n\n24:04.000 --> 24:05.000\nI'm just glad that you're doing\n\n24:05.000 --> 24:06.000\nThe show here\n\n24:06.000 --> 24:07.000\nWeekly now\n\n24:07.000 --> 24:08.000\nI mean, it's really fun\n\n24:08.000 --> 24:09.000\nAnd I love\n\n24:09.000 --> 24:10.000\nFor anyone who's listening\n\n24:10.000 --> 24:11.000\nAbout four people support that\n\n24:11.000 --> 24:12.000\nBut I love\n\n24:12.000 --> 24:13.000\nFor anyone who's listening\n\n24:13.000 --> 24:14.000\nTo this podcast\n\n24:14.000 --> 24:15.000\nYou should really know\n\n24:15.000 --> 24:17.000\nLike Dan walks the line\n\n24:17.000 --> 24:18.000\nWhen people are lining up\n\n24:18.000 --> 24:19.000\nGet suggestions\n\n24:19.000 --> 24:20.000\nTalks to people\n\n24:20.000 --> 24:21.000\nLike there's a very\n\n24:21.000 --> 24:22.000\nCommunal thing\n\n24:22.000 --> 24:23.000\nAre you enjoying your time here?\n\n24:23.000 --> 24:24.000\nIt must be nice\n\n24:24.000 --> 24:25.000\nIt's not therapy\n\n24:25.000 --> 24:26.000\nIt's nice, right?\n\n24:26.000 --> 24:27.000\nI won't do therapy\n\n24:27.000 --> 24:28.000\nI can't do it\n\n24:28.000 --> 24:30.000\nWhat do you not like about therapy?\n\n24:30.000 --> 24:32.000\nIt's dumb people\n\n24:32.000 --> 24:34.000\nOh, shit\n\n24:34.000 --> 24:35.000\nHoly shit\n\n24:35.000 --> 24:37.000\nMothra just flew on stage\n\n24:37.000 --> 24:38.000\nFlying cockroach\n\n24:38.000 --> 24:39.000\nCurt, it's a flying cockroach\n\n24:39.000 --> 24:40.000\nA cockroach\n\n24:40.000 --> 24:41.000\nThe size of a hubcap\n\n24:41.000 --> 24:43.000\nJust hit Dan in the chest\n\n24:44.000 --> 24:45.000\nThe hair stood in the back of my head\n\n24:45.000 --> 24:47.000\nI thought somebody threw a frisbee in it\n\n24:47.000 --> 24:48.000\nNo, I thought\n\n24:48.000 --> 24:49.000\nI thought a group of therapists\n\n24:49.000 --> 24:51.000\nGot busted\n\n24:51.000 --> 24:53.000\nI thought I was going to get\n\n24:53.000 --> 24:55.000\nFucking murdered by\n\n24:55.000 --> 24:57.000\nThe middle of the bell curve\n\n24:57.000 --> 24:58.000\nA pherodactyl\n\n24:58.000 --> 25:00.000\nI thought that people with the minimal\n\n25:00.000 --> 25:02.000\nRequirements for degrees\n\n25:02.000 --> 25:03.000\nYeah\n\n25:03.000 --> 25:04.000\nAnd judging people\n\n25:04.000 --> 25:06.000\nYou call a demographic\n\n25:06.000 --> 25:08.000\nStupid and a giant animal\n\n25:08.000 --> 25:09.000\nGet infected\n\n25:09.000 --> 25:11.000\nThat's an argument for shamanism\n\n25:11.000 --> 25:12.000\nIf anything\n\n25:12.000 --> 25:13.000\nActually\n\n25:13.000 --> 25:14.000\nI didn't say shamanism was bullshit\n\n25:14.000 --> 25:16.000\nWhoever sent that moth up here\n\n25:16.000 --> 25:17.000\nDan, snake, snake\n\n25:17.000 --> 25:19.000\nI like to think that that was\n\n25:19.000 --> 25:21.000\nThe drunk fairy\n\n25:21.000 --> 25:23.000\nAnd\n\n25:23.000 --> 25:25.000\nDan, you tell him\n\n25:25.000 --> 25:27.000\nBut it's undoing\n\n25:27.000 --> 25:29.000\nThe thing is not dead\n\n25:29.000 --> 25:30.000\nCan we kill it?\n\n25:30.000 --> 25:31.000\nWe crushed it\n\n25:31.000 --> 25:32.000\nSomeone crushed it\n\n25:32.000 --> 25:33.000\nA hero in our audience\n\n25:33.000 --> 25:35.000\nStep forward and slayed the dragon\n\n25:37.000 --> 25:38.000\nQuickly, men\n\n25:38.000 --> 25:39.000\nHoly shit\n\n25:39.000 --> 25:40.000\nQuickly\n\n25:40.000 --> 25:42.000\nThe greatest adventure\n\n25:42.000 --> 25:43.000\nStretch me a toothpick\n\n25:43.000 --> 25:45.000\nWe must place its head on a spike\n\n25:45.000 --> 25:47.000\nTo warn its compatriots\n\n25:47.000 --> 25:49.000\nOh my god\n\n25:49.000 --> 25:50.000\nDude\n\n25:50.000 --> 25:51.000\nDude\n\n25:51.000 --> 25:53.000\nYou fucking destroyed\n\n25:53.000 --> 25:55.000\nBut I didn't even flesh\n\n25:55.000 --> 25:56.000\nJust got up and just\n\n25:56.000 --> 25:58.000\nJust dispatched it\n\n25:58.000 --> 25:59.000\nNow\n\n25:59.000 --> 26:00.000\nEmily's coming up with a napkin\n\n26:00.000 --> 26:01.000\nLike\n\n26:01.000 --> 26:03.000\nLike it's 50s radio\n\n26:03.000 --> 26:04.000\nNow my question is\n\n26:04.000 --> 26:05.000\nMy question is\n\n26:05.000 --> 26:07.000\nWhat if that was Bjork in fairy form\n\n26:07.000 --> 26:09.000\nIt was like\n\n26:09.000 --> 26:11.000\nI have been summoned\n\n26:11.000 --> 26:13.000\nTo somebody\n\n26:13.000 --> 26:15.000\nI've spoken my name\n\n26:15.000 --> 26:17.000\nThree times\n\n26:17.000 --> 26:19.000\nAnd then she shows up and then\n\n26:19.000 --> 26:20.000\nBlam\n\n26:23.000 --> 26:24.000\nShe had her chance\n\n26:24.000 --> 26:26.000\nWhere you were fat and in leather\n\n26:28.000 --> 26:29.000\nA real fairy would have seen\n\n26:29.000 --> 26:31.000\nThe prince that you were going to become\n\n26:31.000 --> 26:32.000\nThat's right, she didn't know\n\n26:32.000 --> 26:33.000\nLet's thank Chris Hardwick\n\n26:33.000 --> 26:34.000\nThank you, everyone\n\n26:34.000 --> 26:36.000\nThank you, Dan Harmon\n\n26:36.000 --> 26:37.000\nThank you, Jeff Davis\n\n26:43.000 --> 26:44.000\nThank you, Chris\n\n26:45.000 --> 26:46.000\nThat was delightful\n\n26:46.000 --> 26:47.000\nI can't think of a better\n\n26:47.000 --> 26:48.000\nCloser\n\n26:48.000 --> 26:49.000\nI didn't know\n\n26:49.000 --> 26:50.000\nI don't know how to close\n\n26:50.000 --> 26:51.000\nI warned him in the green room\n\n26:51.000 --> 26:52.000\nI don't know how to do interviews\n\n26:52.000 --> 26:53.000\nBut please come up\n\n26:53.000 --> 26:54.000\nBecause I want to tell people\n\n26:54.000 --> 26:55.000\nHow cool you are\n\n26:55.000 --> 26:56.000\nFor all I know\n\n26:56.000 --> 26:57.000\nHe could be a rapist\n\n26:57.000 --> 26:58.000\nI don't know\n\n26:58.000 --> 26:59.000\nI don't know anything about him\n\n26:59.000 --> 27:00.000\nI know two things about him\n\n27:00.000 --> 27:01.000\nAnd they suggest that he's like\n\n27:01.000 --> 27:03.000\nA knight in shining armor\n\n27:03.000 --> 27:04.000\nHe seems like a cool guy\n\n27:04.000 --> 27:05.000\nYeah, I see right through it\n\n27:05.000 --> 27:06.000\nI won't listen to\n\n27:07.000 --> 27:08.000\nNo\n\n27:08.000 --> 27:09.000\nYou caught up\n\n27:09.000 --> 27:10.000\nImmediately\n\n27:10.000 --> 27:11.000\nYou zeroed in\n\n27:11.000 --> 27:12.000\nOn the leather pants thing\n\n27:12.000 --> 27:13.000\nYou're

28:40.000\nTo make us stop advertising Adidas\n\n28:40.000 --> 28:43.000\nUnless Puma gives us 10\n\n28:45.000 --> 28:47.000\nAnybody can beat Greg Proups\n\n28:47.000 --> 28:49.000\nAnd get Spotify

29:10.000\nIt's new, it's noteworthy\n\n29:10.000 --> 29:11.000\nWhat does that mean?\n\n29:11.000 --> 29:13.000\nOur show is the Adidas of podcasts\n\n29:14.000 --> 29:16.000\nUntil further notice\n\n29:18.000 --> 29:21.000\nYou hear that, you Nike cocksuckers?\n\n29:22.000 --> 29:24.000\nYou're throwing money away\n\n29:25.000 --> 29:28.000\nThere's other techniques we could try next week\n\n29:29.000 --> 29:30.000\nNike, next week\n\n29:30.000 --> 29:33.000\nWe're gonna start coming at you from different angles\n\n29:33.000 --> 29:35.000\nWe're gonna start saying we like

podcast\n\n29:44.000 --> 29:45.000\nLet's do something less visual\n\n29:45.000 --> 29:46.000\nYeah, you're right, you're right\n\n29:46.000 --> 29:47.000\nSorry\n\n29:51.000 --> 29:53.000\nWe're

about\n\n30:16.000 --> 30:19.000\nI've been going through the stack of audience submissions\n\n30:19.000 --> 30:20.000\nI pulled a few aside\n\n30:20.000 --> 30:22.000\nThere's some really dark ones in here\n\n30:22.000 --> 30:23.000\nDo you wanna talk about\n\n30:23.000 --> 30:26.000\nI only have, I'll read down a list of things that I had\n\n30:26.000 --> 30:28.000\non my list of things to talk

room\n\n30:39.000 --> 30:41.000\nand Dan was talking about\n\n30:41.000 --> 30:43.000\nlike people in high school that are\n\n30:43.000 --> 30:45.000\nlike if you have a silly name, right?\n\n30:45.000 --> 30:46.000\nLike some people that\n\n30:46.000 --> 30:47.000\nI was illustrating the point\n\n30:47.000 --> 30:49.000\nthat if you had a silly name\n\n30:49.000 --> 30:50.000\nand this is one of those things\n\n30:50.000 --> 30:52.000\nthat we've talked in point\n\n30:52.000 --> 30:54.000\nWe've talked about this on the\n\n30:55.000 --> 30:56.000\nin the show\n\n30:56.000 --> 30:57.000\nso if any of you have been here\n\n30:57.000 --> 30:59.000\nand don't feel cheated\n\n30:59.000 --> 31:01.000\nnow that we're podcasting\n\n31:01.000 --> 31:02.000\nWe're breaking out the chess box\n\n31:02.000 --> 31:04.000\nEdit out point\n\n31:06.000 --> 31:08.000\nIf any of you wanted to just yell out\n\n31:08.000 --> 31:10.000\nI hate Mexicans\n\n31:10.000 --> 31:12.000\nYou should have done it in there\n\n31:13.000 --> 31:15.000\nNow it's on the record\n\n31:15.000 --> 31:17.000\nI don't know what that means\n\n31:17.000 --> 31:19.000\nI don't know why I'm so racist\n\n31:20.000 --> 31:21.000\nWhy are you so racist?\n\n31:21.000 --> 31:22.000\nWhy is everything about race?\n\n31:22.000 --> 31:23.000\nYou're fascinated by race\n\n31:23.000 --> 31:24.000\nBecause it was brought up\n\n31:24.000 --> 31:25.000\nto not be racist\n\n31:25.000 --> 31:27.000\nand I just think it's something\n\n31:27.000 --> 31:28.000\nthat people care about\n\n31:28.000 --> 31:30.000\nYou marvel at Mexicans\n\n31:30.000 --> 31:31.000\nand Asians\n\n31:31.000 --> 31:32.000\nand black people\n\n31:32.000 --> 31:33.000\nYeah, I think\n\n31:33.000 --> 31:34.000\nbecause it's like\n\n31:34.000 --> 31:36.000\nOkay, when you go bowling\n\n31:36.000 --> 31:37.000\nYour job is to...\n\n31:37.000 --> 31:38.000\nOh, here we go\n\n31:39.000 --> 31:41.000\nThe reason I'm fascinated with race\n\n31:41.000 --> 31:42.000\nI think\n\n31:42.000 --> 31:44.000\nThis is my defense of my fascination\n\n31:44.000 --> 31:46.000\nwith race and racism\n\n31:46.000 --> 31:47.000\nWhen you go bowling\n\n31:47.000 --> 31:48.000\nYou never see black people...\n\n31:48.000 --> 31:49.000\nNo, I'm kidding\n\n31:50.000 --> 31:52.000\nThat's what you thought I was going to say, isn't it?\n\n31:52.000 --> 31:54.000\nNo, when you go bowling\n\n31:54.000 --> 31:56.000\nThere's pins down there\n\n31:56.000 --> 31:57.000\nand the goal of bowling is\n\n31:57.000 --> 31:59.000\nyou take a ball and you roll it\n\n32:01.000 --> 32:02.000\nThe reason why it's a sport\n\n32:02.000 --> 32:04.000\nand not just a thing that you do\n\n32:04.000 --> 32:06.000\nis because of these gutters\n\n32:06.000 --> 32:08.000\nThe gutters represent this thing\n\n32:08.000 --> 32:09.000\nIt's like by default\n\n32:09.000 --> 32:10.000\nwhat happens is your ball\n\n32:10.000 --> 32:11.000\nrolls into the gutter\n\n32:11.000 --> 32:13.000\nand you don't hit a single pin\n\n32:13.000 --> 32:16.000\nSo you have to thread this needle\n\n32:16.000 --> 32:17.000\nwith bowling\n\n32:17.000 --> 32:18.000\nand with communication\n\n32:18.000 --> 32:19.000\nand with culture and stuff\n\n32:19.000 --> 32:21.000\nI said with our perception\n\n32:21.000 --> 32:22.000\nof what race is\n\n32:22.000 --> 32:23.000\nand what racism is\n\n32:23.000 --> 32:25.000\nwe're so obsessed with it\n\n32:25.000 --> 32:27.000\nand I'm always fascinated by the gutter\n\n32:27.000 --> 32:29.000\nI'm fascinated by the fact that\n\n32:29.000 --> 32:31.000\noh, if it goes too far to the left\n\n32:31.000 --> 32:33.000\nit just goes in there\n\n32:33.000 --> 32:35.000\nand that's the default response\n\n32:35.000 --> 32:36.000\nAnd I don't know\n\n32:36.000 --> 32:37.000\nAre we...\n\n32:37.000 --> 32:39.000\nIs the guy that owns the bowling alley\n\n32:39.000 --> 32:40.000\nthe right guy?\n\n32:40.000 --> 32:42.000\nIs the guy that's making all the money\n\n32:42.000 --> 32:44.000\noff of us threading this needle\n\n32:44.000 --> 32:46.000\nIs he laughing all the way to the bank?\n\n32:46.000 --> 32:48.000\nAnd is that the right bank?\n\n32:49.000 --> 32:51.000\nWhere are you going with this?\n\n32:51.000 --> 32:54.000\nIf that's not interesting to you guys\n\n32:54.000 --> 32:56.000\nyou deserve Jeff Davis's Mars\n\n32:56.000 --> 32:57.000\nI didn't bring it up\n\n32:57.000 --> 32:59.000\nI didn't bring it up\n\n32:59.000 --> 33:02.000\nI will take the time to tell you\n\n33:02.000 --> 33:04.000\nWho's the hero in that bowling story?\n\n33:06.000 --> 33:07.000\nThe person that's bowling\n\n33:07.000 --> 33:08.000\nis just any person\n\n33:08.000 --> 33:09.000\nany person at all\n\n33:09.000 --> 33:10.000\nIt's a human being\n\n33:10.000 --> 33:11.000\nAnd what's the gutter?\n\n33:17.000 --> 33:19.000\nThe gutter represents the fact that\n\n33:19.000 --> 33:21.000\nit represents the ball game\n\n33:26.000 --> 33:28.000\nRob Schrab has become a downright mutinous\n\n33:30.000 --> 33:31.000\nI'm telling you something\n\n33:31.000 --> 33:33.000\nI was going to say talk to me after this show\n\n33:33.000 --> 33:34.000\nbut don't\n\n33:36.000 --> 33:38.000\nTalk to me before next week's show\n\n33:38.000 --> 33:39.000\nLet's all go bowling\n\n33:39.000 --> 33:41.000\nThat sounds really wild\n\n33:41.000 --> 33:45.000\nOr pledge $2,500 to the Anomalyza Kickstarter\n\n33:45.000 --> 33:47.000\nand go drinking with me and Dino\n\n33:47.000 --> 33:49.000\nand I'll tell you all about\n\n33:49.000 --> 33:50.000\nthe bowling metaphor\n\n33:50.000 --> 33:51.000\nwhich I just landed on\n\n33:51.000 --> 33:53.000\nI just made it up now\n\n33:53.000 --> 33:54.000\nIt's fucking perfect\n\n33:54.000 --> 33:55.000\nI'm on to something\n\n33:55.000 --> 33:56.000\nI'm going to write a book\n\n33:56.000 --> 33:58.000\nand I'm not going to share with any of you\n\n33:58.000 --> 33:59.000\nthe profits\n\n33:59.000 --> 34:00.000\nYou're not going to get a free copy\n\n34:00.000 --> 34:01.000\nYou're not going to get anything\n\n34:01.000 --> 34:02.000\nbecause you didn't support me\n\n34:02.000 --> 34:04.000\nYou backed a hooligan\n\n34:04.000 --> 34:06.000\nand my friend\n\n34:06.000 --> 34:08.000\nAnd also that was brought to you by Nike\n\n34:10.000 --> 34:12.000\nMy thoughts on racism\n\n34:12.000 --> 34:14.000\nare brought to you by Nike\n\n34:14.000 -->

--> 35:01.000\nwhere he thinks\n\n35:01.000 --> 35:03.000\nas in most of Jeff's stories\n\n35:03.000 --> 35:06.000\nthose of you who are hardcore Armenians\n\n35:07.000 --> 35:09.000\nyou know that when Jeff tells a story\n\n35:09.000 --> 35:12.000\nthere's a theme\n\n35:12.000 --> 35:14.000\nDon't interrupt me\n\n35:14.000 --> 35:17.000\nYou're talking about me, why would I?\n\n35:17.000 --> 35:19.000\nI'm going to make up a story\n\n35:19.000 --> 35:21.000\nand try to fill it to the Jeff Davis template\n\n35:21.000 --> 35:23.000\nof storytelling\n\n35:23.000 --> 35:26.000\nJeff goes to a laundromat\n\n35:26.000 --> 35:29.000\nand he puts a shirt in the washing machine\n\n35:29.000 --> 35:31.000\nand a beautiful Cuban woman\n\n35:31.000 --> 35:33.000\nis like watching him\n\n35:33.000 --> 35:35.000\nand she comes over and she asks him\n\n35:35.000 --> 35:37.000\nwhy he's putting his shirt\n\n35:37.000 --> 35:39.000\nin the washing machine in quite that way\n\n35:39.000 --> 35:41.000\nand he explains\n\n35:41.000 --> 35:43.000\nI don't know, I thought that the shirt\n\n35:43.000 --> 35:45.000\nneeded to be cleaned first\n\n35:45.000 --> 35:47.000\nand she puts a hand on his arm and says\n\n35:47.000 --> 35:49.000\nthank you\n\n35:49.000 --> 35:51.000\nand then she takes him back\n\n35:51.000 --> 35:53.000\nand introduces her family\n\n35:53.000 --> 35:55.000\nand she just fucks him blue\n\n35:55.000 --> 35:57.000\nJeff has these stories\n\n35:57.000 --> 35:59.000\nI don't think they're false\n\n35:59.000 --> 36:01.000\nI think these things happen to Jeff\n\n36:01.000 --> 36:03.000\nJeff falls into these adventures\n\n36:03.000 --> 36:05.000\nhis personality is\n\n36:05.000 --> 36:07.000\nthey trust him\n\n36:07.000 --> 36:09.000\nand they open up to him\n\n36:09.000 --> 36:11.000\nand they want him to like them\n\n36:11.000 --> 36:13.000\nand things\n\n36:13.000 --> 36:15.000\nso Jeff went to the JPL facility\n\n36:15.000 --> 36:17.000\nJet Propulsion Lab\n\n36:17.000 --> 36:19.000\nseems a little uninventive\n\n36:19.000 --> 36:21.000\nfor rocket scientists\n\n36:21.000 --> 36:23.000\ninvited by a friend to go to the\n\n36:23.000 --> 36:25.000\nJet Propulsion Laboratory\n\n36:25.000 --> 36:27.000\nand it was a tour from a guy that works\n\n36:27.000 --> 36:29.000\nand I won't get too specific about his job\n\n36:29.000 --> 36:31.000\nI think that he was going to get in trouble\n\n36:31.000 --> 36:33.000\nfor saying too much\n\n36:33.000 --> 36:35.000\nand you can see a little mock-up\n\n36:35.000 --> 36:37.000\nof the Voyager probe and Cassini\n\n36:37.000 --> 36:39.000\nand stuff like that\n\n36:39.000 --> 36:41.000\nI like space travel stuff\n\n36:41.000 --> 36:43.000\nand\n\n36:43.000 --> 36:45.000\nwe're going a little bit\n\n36:45.000 --> 36:47.000\nbehind the scenes\n\n36:47.000 --> 36:49.000\nthis is not on the regular tour\n\n36:49.000 --> 36:51.000\nbecause I work on such and such a program\n\n36:51.000 --> 36:53.000\nand we get to go see the rooms\n\n36:53.000 --> 36:55.000\nwhere they're building\n\n36:55.000 --> 36:57.000\nwhat is now called Curiosity\n\n36:57.000 --> 36:59.000\nthat I think last night successfully landed on Mars\n\n36:59.000 --> 37:01.000\nand yeah\n\n37:01.000 --> 37:03.000\nvery cool\n\n37:03.000 --> 37:05.000\nback then they called the Mars Science\n\n37:05.000 --> 37:07.000\nLaboratory\n\n37:07.000 --> 37:09.000\nanother uncreated\n\n37:09.000 --> 37:11.000\nthese people are real Shakespeare's over there\n\n37:11.000 --> 37:13.000\nand so we saw\n\n37:13.000 --> 37:15.000\nit was just this big gigantic thing about the size of a Prius\n\n37:15.000 --> 37:17.000\nand it's got a big\n\n37:17.000 --> 37:19.000\nmeaningful heavy backhoe\n\n37:19.000 --> 37:21.000\nshovel on it and giant wheels\n\n37:21.000 --> 37:23.000\nabout like 10\n\n37:23.000 --> 37:25.000\nto 12 inches across\n\n37:25.000 --> 37:27.000\nthis thing was mean, the rovers were the size of a coffee table\n\n37:27.000 --> 37:29.000\nwe're going back there with a purpose\n\n37:29.000 --> 37:31.000\nlike this big robust\n\n37:31.000 --> 37:33.000\nlike the previous one had little arms on it\n\n37:33.000 --> 37:35.000\nwe don't know if it's a bottle of wine so there's a corkscrew\n\n37:35.000 --> 37:37.000\nwe might have to kill a moth\n\n37:37.000 --> 37:39.000\nso there's a little moth\n\n37:39.000 --> 37:41.000\nwe don't know what's going to happen\n\n37:41.000 --> 37:43.000\nthere's wheels on top and bottom\n\n37:43.000 --> 37:45.000\nthis thing was a bulldozer\n\n37:45.000 --> 37:47.000\nthis thing's going digging and analyzing\n\n37:47.000 --> 37:49.000\nand it's very intense\n\n37:49.000 --> 37:51.000\nand the people are very nervous\n\n37:51.000 --> 37:53.000\nso now that thing that I got to see a little peek at\n\n37:53.000 --> 37:55.000\nit's also very cool and very human\n\n37:55.000 --> 37:57.000\nit made me so proud of humanity\n\n37:57.000 --> 37:59.000\nlooking on this titanium chassis\n\n37:59.000 --> 38:01.000\nwith these big wheels in the corner and this big shovel\n\n38:01.000 --> 38:03.000\nwith just a good old proper crescent wrench\n\n38:03.000 --> 38:05.000\njust some dudes wrench\n\n38:05.000 --> 38:07.000\nsnap on tools\n\n38:07.000 --> 38:09.000\nthe Adidas of tools\n\n38:09.000 --> 38:11.000\nyou hear that Nike?\n\n38:11.000 --> 38:13.000\nhe had pieces of shit\n\n38:15.000 --> 38:17.000\ncowards\n\n38:17.000 --> 38:19.000\nso it was very cool\n\n38:19.000 --> 38:21.000\nand so we're walking around the hallways\n\n38:21.000 --> 38:23.000\nI'm talking to this guy, a scientist\n\n38:23.000 --> 38:25.000\nand he works just about my age\n\n38:25.000 --> 38:27.000\nand a little younger actually\n\n38:27.000 --> 38:29.000\nI don't know about my age\n\n38:29.000 --> 38:31.000\nhe works and he flies spaceships\n\n38:31.000 --> 38:33.000\nand stuff it's very cool and I said\n\n38:33.000 --> 38:35.000\nwere you there when the cameras turned on?\n\n38:35.000 --> 38:37.000\nhe doesn't fly spaceships\n\n38:37.000 --> 38:39.000\nI don't want to get him in trouble\n\n38:39.000 --> 38:41.000\nwhat? he gets in trouble if they tell him\n\n38:41.000 --> 38:43.000\nwhat spaceship he flies?\n\n38:43.000 --> 38:45.000\nwas this Battlestar Galactica?\n\n38:45.000 --> 38:47.000\nthere's Cylons?\n\n38:47.000 --> 38:49.000\nthis is not an exaggeration\n\n38:49.000 --> 38:51.000\nthis is not yellow journalism here\n\n38:51.000 --> 38:53.000\nI was walking through the thing\n\n38:53.000 --> 38:55.000\nfrom Spirit\n\n38:55.000 --> 38:57.000\nand Opportunity\n\n38:57.000 --> 38:59.000\nyou mean he controls spaceships?\n\n38:59.000 --> 39:01.000\nyeah\n\n39:01.000 --> 39:03.000\nhe sends math\n\n39:03.000 --> 39:05.000\nthat flies probes and things around\n\n39:05.000 --> 39:07.000\nI think he was like starbucks or something\n\n39:07.000 --> 39:09.000\nhe didn't sit in them\n\n39:09.000 --> 39:11.000\nwe fly them\n\n39:11.000 --> 39:13.000\nwe fly them remotely\n\n39:13.000 --> 39:15.000\nthese things\n\n39:15.000 --> 39:17.000\nmaybe one day they'll actually be people on Mars\n\n39:17.000 --> 39:19.000\nbecause\n\n39:19.000 --> 39:21.000\nof what I think was going on in this conversation\n\n39:21.000 --> 39:23.000\nI said\n\n39:23.000 --> 39:25.000\nwhen you were there\n\n39:25.000 --> 39:27.000\nand when the cameras turned on\n\n39:27.000 --> 39:29.000\nthe first images were beamed back to Earth\n\n39:29.000 --> 39:31.000\nand you didn't know if the thing was going to work\n\n39:31.000 --> 39:33.000\nbut you guys are all scientists\n\n39:33.000 --> 39:35.000\nyou guys watch sci-fi movies\n\n39:35.000 --> 39:37.000\nyou're clearly all\n\n39:37.000 --> 39:39.000\nsci-fi enthusiasts\n\n39:39.000 --> 39:41.000\nwhen that camera turned on\n\n39:41.000 --> 39:43.000\naren't you all holding hands and thinking\n\n39:43.000 --> 39:45.000\nwhat if we saw a footprint\n\n39:45.000 --> 39:47.000\nor a guy running by\n\n39:47.000 --> 39:49.000\nor a snickers rapper\n\n39:49.000 --> 39:51.000\nand he goes yeah\n\n39:51.000 --> 39:53.000\nI'd be lying if I said that wasn't the case\n\n39:53.000 --> 39:55.000\nso like\n\n39:55.000 --> 39:57.000\nwhat did you see?\n\n39:57.000 --> 39:59.000\nhis eyebrows went up and he just kind of blushed a little bit\n\n39:59.000 --> 40:01.000\nI go like did you see something cool?\n\n40:01.000 --> 40:03.000\nhe's

--> 40:25.000\nI'm like what did you\n\n40:25.000 --> 40:27.000\nfucking see?\n\n40:27.000 --> 40:29.000\nand he's like stop it\n\n40:29.000 --> 40:31.000\ncan we go outside?\n\n40:31.000 --> 40:33.000\nstop it\n\n40:33.000 --> 40:35.000\nthere's a little place next to the dumpster where they smoke cigarettes\n\n40:35.000 --> 40:37.000\nthere's no cameras\n\n40:37.000 --> 40:39.000\nso anyways when the Martian dick\n\n40:39.000 --> 40:41.000\ngoes in your soup\n\n40:41.000 --> 40:43.000\nit's like men in black\n\n40:43.000 --> 40:45.000\ndid you see a tree?\n\n40:45.000 --> 40:47.000\ndid you find diamonds?\n\n40:47.000 --> 40:49.000\nwhat the fuck is going on up there?\n\n40:49.000 --> 40:51.000\nand he was real bummed out\n\n40:51.000 --> 40:53.000\nand he walked away from me and his face turned like plaid\n\n40:53.000 --> 40:55.000\nhe was so\n\n40:55.000 --> 40:57.000\nhe was like really bummed out and nervous about some shit\n\n40:57.000 --> 40:59.000\nhe's like I can lose my job\n\n40:59.000 --> 41:01.000\nI can't talk about these missions\n\n41:01.000 --> 41:03.000\nso he walked outside\n\n41:03.000 --> 41:05.000\nand I'm like my friend Jerry\n\n41:05.000 --> 41:07.000\nthat took me and he's like dude what did you say to someone\n\n41:07.000 --> 41:09.000\nso I'm like he was the guy\n\n41:09.000 --> 41:11.000\nthat blew it\n\n41:11.000 --> 41:13.000\nand he's like yeah he's all bummed out\n\n41:13.000 --> 41:15.000\nI want you to stop talking about that\n\n41:15.000 --> 41:17.000\nso then\n\n41:17.000 --> 41:19.000\nso then we go to this building\n\n41:19.000 --> 41:21.000\nand we see this thing and they're building a giant Prius\n\n41:21.000 --> 41:23.000\nwith a huge backhoe shovel on it\n\n41:23.000 --> 41:25.000\nlike they're going fucking digging\n\n41:25.000 --> 41:27.000\nthey're going digging but I agree with that\n\n41:27.000 --> 41:29.000\nyou send up a little thing with a little brush on it\n\n41:29.000 -->

simplicity.\n\n01:01:54.000 --> 01:02:00.000\nI've heard a lot of people, but I feel worst about not feeling bad about any of it.\n\n01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:05.000\nWell, yeah, that's your sociopath, right?\n\n01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:09.000\nAnd you know that, and you're afraid of getting caught, and that's the only thing that drives you.\n\n01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:12.000\nWhat's the most shameful thing you could say?\n\n01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:15.000\nWhat's something that you would just be like?\n\n01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:18.000\nI think it's closely related to that.\n\n01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:24.000\nI think the most shameful thing I could say is how little I care about other people's lives.\n\n01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:30.000\nI was in the bar tonight, and I saw that there was another fucking shooting, and I didn't know.\n\n01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:35.000\nWe made comments about it, and we talked politically and psychologically about it.\n\n01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:40.000\nDan and I met before the show, and it's that the shooting in the Sikh temple was at Wisconsin, was it?\n\n01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:45.000\nYeah, and it's just hot on the heels of that last asshole in the movie theater.\n\n01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000\nIt was my first response, of course.\n\n01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000\nI'm from Wisconsin.\n\n01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:54.000\nAnd then we're talking about media coverage.\n\n01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:59.000\nWe're talking about whether or not they should have given so much attention to the Joker guy.\n\n01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:02.000\nIt's just me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me.\n\n01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:11.000\nI don't know what we're supposed to do, get off our bar stools and run out in the street and stop traffic like in a Spike Lee movie and say,\n\n01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:15.000\nWake up! Everyone stop! We're humans.\n\n01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:20.000\nBut I don't think that other people exist.\n\n01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:23.000\nThat is my most shameful confession.\n\n01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:33.000\nI think that if you started to care that other people existed, you would get absorbed by them, and you would never be alive.\n\n01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:41.000\nBut in some way, does that qualify you or disqualify you as someone that creates characters and writes shows about people and for people?\n\n01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:47.000\nHalfway through your question, I started thinking about myself.\n\n01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:52.000\nHalfway through my question, I was thinking about little boys.\n\n01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:56.000\nI don't know. I confess that in the hopes that we all go through that.\n\n01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:03.000\nBut I've known people like our friend Daniel Gillies, who's on Vampire Diaries, who before he was on Vampire Diaries,\n\n01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:08.000\nheard about Katrina happening and jumped in his car and drove down to Katrina.\n\n01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:18.000\nAnd commandeered a bulldozer because Red Cross wouldn't let him have one because you have to go through all this rigamarole to actually be in a vehicle and helping people out.\n\n01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:26.000\nSo he went to a neighborhood where nobody was helping, like one of the many neglected neighborhoods, and he just rented one?\n\n01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:31.000\nI think he had to steal one because the government was like, you can't help people. You're not allowed to help.\n\n01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:35.000\nHelping people is worth a dollar. You have to go over to the line and get a helping people pen.\n\n01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:42.000\nFuture Elijah from Vampire Diaries is this, oh, mate, I'm going to clean up this garbage man.\n\n01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000\nHe's Australian or Kiwi.\n\n01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:48.000\nIt's not even his country, and he's like, fucking, people are drowning.\n\n01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:52.000\nHe's like, Jeff, just watching the TV, and I was like, I can't just sit at home and watch.\n\n01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:56.000\nI'm like, I did. I could.\n\n01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:00.000\nI was like, whoa, flipping back and forth.\n\n01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000\nWhat's Jerry Springer doing?\n\n01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:06.000\nYeah, that's my shameful confession is that I'm everything they want me to be.\n\n01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:16.000\nI'm a fucking breastfeeding baby on this tube that comes into your living room.\n\n01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:20.000\nThat's one of those confessions, like the guy that confessed the cat thing.\n\n01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:25.000\nThere were a couple of those where the thing was like, the real crime was like, when you're really confessing it, it's like,\n\n01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:33.000\nand I don't believe that the confession helps because otherwise I would have confessed it a long time ago.\n\n01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:39.000\nA confession is something that you don't want to be true.\n\n01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:44.000\nAnd we're primates, so if you hide it long enough, it goes away.\n\n01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:48.000\nCat shits on the carpet, dries, turns into crumbs, blows away in the wind.\n\n01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:51.000\nTake your shitty underwear and put it in the garbage.\n\n01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:52.000\nYou never shit your pants.\n\n01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000\nWe forgot.\n\n01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:55.000\nYou play with matches.\n\n01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:56.000\nMom doesn't catch you.\n\n01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:57.000\nIt never happened.\n\n01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:00.000\nYou murder somebody, and the body goes away.\n\n01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:03.000\nYou're not guilty.\n\n01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:04.000\nSo confession is over.\n\n01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000\nHere's the thing about confession.\n\n01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:07.000\nNo fucking resolution.\n\n01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:08.000\nThat's the thing.\n\n01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:09.000\nOkay?\n\n01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:10.000\nMaybe that's how we slipped.\n\n01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:11.000\nI'm just stumbling into this.\n\n01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000\nI took World History in 10th grade.\n\n01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:18.000\nThe Catholic Church invented this concept of they would sell you absolution.\n\n01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000\nLike, they put a dollar value on it.\n\n01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:21.000\nThat would be my next step, as I would say.\n\n01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000\nWrite it down on the slip of paper.\n\n01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:24.000\nWe'll read it out loud.\n\n01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:25.000\nTell it to me or me alone.\n\n01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:26.000\nGive me a dollar.\n\n01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:27.000\nNow it's done.\n\n01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.000\nNow it's over.\n\n01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.000\nNow you didn't do it.\n\n01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000\nMaybe that's not how confession works.\n\n01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000\nMaybe confession just needs to happen.\n\n01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:34.000\nIt just bubble it up.\n\n01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:35.000\nIt just becomes a froth.\n\n01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000\nLike a zit on your face.\n\n01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000\nBlackhead turns into a whitehead.\n\n01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000\nMaybe it stays painful.\n\n01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:42.000\nMaybe it festers.\n\n01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:45.000\nBut maybe honesty stays the best policy.\n\n01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:50.000\nWe confess stuff that doesn't lead to us not having done stuff.\n\n01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:51.000\nI'm still a shitty person.\n\n01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000\nI shared it with you, though.\n\n01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000\nIt goes to the front of my brain.\n\n01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:56.000\nI don't know.\n\n01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:57.000\nSo that's it.\n\n01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000\nSo now we move on to...\n\n01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000\nBecause this is important.\n\n01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000\nI'm making this commitment.\n\n01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:06.000\nWe've got the Harmontown.com website going up.\n\n01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:09.000\nI'm going to put on the Harmontown.com\n\n01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000\nsometime between now and the next show.\n\n01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:14.000\nI have to make sure that Jeff and I have rolled\n\n01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:17.000\nfirst level Dungeons & Dragons characters.\n\n01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:20.000\nAdvanced Dungeons & Dragons characters.\n\n01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:24.000\nI guess I have to specify first edition.\n\n01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:27.000\nWell, okay.\n\n01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000\nSorry, buddy.\n\n01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000\nSomebody cried out in pain.\n\n01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000\nLike a wolf trapped in a little...\n\n01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000\nThe saddest confession of all.\n\n01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000\nWell, okay.\n\n01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000\nSee, that already gets complicated.\n\n01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:43.000\nI grew up on just AD&D with the old school stuff.\n\n01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:44.000\nI don't know.\n\n01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000\nSo is anybody here...\n\n01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:49.000\nIs somebody here like a Dungeons & Dragons kind of aficionado?\n\n01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:50.000\nAlright.\n\n01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:51.000\nFirst hand to shoot up.\n\n01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:54.000\nAre you willing to come up here for just a second?\n\n01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000\nJust to answer some questions.\n\n01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000\nLet's welcome him to the stage.\n\n01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000\nYou all mean...\n\n01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000\nWhat is your name?\n\n01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:05.000\nSpencer.\n\n01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:06.000\nSpencer, everybody.\n\n01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000\nAlright, that's already a good...\n\n01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:14.000\nI got to admit, AD&D is a bit before my time, but I...\n\n01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000\nI get it, I get it.\n\n01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:18.000\nI've read the books.\n\n01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000\nThey just haven't played it too much.\n\n01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:21.000\nWell, that's why I called you up.\n\n01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:24.000\nSo what has happened since 89?\n\n01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000\nLike, I...\n\n01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000\nWell, uh...\n\n01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000\n9-11 happened.\n\n01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000\nWell, I didn't care.\n\n01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:37.000\nI just...\n\n01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:38.000\nHow many...\n\n01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000\nWhat edition of Dungeons & Dragons are we on?\n\n01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:43.000\nUm, I think there's like fourth edition right now.\n\n01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:44.000\nJesus Christ.\n\n01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000\nIs it better than third?\n\n01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:47.000\nHas it been getting better?\n\n01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000\nUm, third edition's probably better.\n\n01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000\nFourth edition's too easy.\n\n01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:52.000\nDoes that make anyone angry?\n\n01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000\nIt's really done down.\n\n01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000\nThird edition's better than fourth?\n\n01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:57.000\nYeah, there's just...\n\n01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000\nOkay, I'm willing to take that as a quarrel.\n\n01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:00.000\nAlright, yeah, I love it.\n\n01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:01.000\nThank you so much.\n\n01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:02.000\nAlright.\n\n01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.000\nPeace on my side.\n\n01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:10.000\nSpencer, would you be willing to generate first-level characters for Jeff Davis and me?\n\n01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:11.000\nUh, so that...\n\n01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:12.000\nAnd then we'll put them on the line.\n\n01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000\nSo sometime, talk to...\n\n01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:15.000\nTalk to us after the show.\n\n01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:16.000\nYeah, no problem.\n\n01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:17.000\nSo we will arrange you being able to upload them.\n\n01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000\nHave you been a Dungeon Master before?\n\n01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000\nYeah, I was like...\n\n01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:22.000\nBefore I was coming here.\n\n01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:23.000\nHey, take it easy.\n\n01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:24.000\nTake it easy.\n\n01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:25.000\nHe was...\n\n01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000\nWe haven't started yet.\n\n01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000\nI'll cast a magic missile.\n\n01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000\nI don't even know what that is.\n\n01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:32.000\nAwesome.\n\n01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:33.000\nSo you've done it before?\n\n01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000\nYeah, no, I was just writing some stuff today actually.\n\n01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:36.000\nFucking yes.\n\n01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000\nHey, don't give him the fucking job.\n\n01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:39.000\nNo, I'm saying...\n\n01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000\nI just need an audition.\n\n01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:42.000\nYeah.\n\n01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:43.000\nYou'll get an audition for sure.\n\n01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000\nBut who better to start with?\n\n01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:48.000\nWe'll inaugurate this new segment.\n\n01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:49.000\nWe need characters.\n\n01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:50.000\nWhat is the end game?\n\n01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:53.000\nWe're going to try to find somebody that we actually want.\n\n01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000\nWe'll try out a handful of people.\n\n01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:58.000\nYeah, we'll play like 15-minute segments with them.\n\n01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:01.000\nIt's not that fair, but either is American Idol.\n\n01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:05.000\nI mean, Radiohead wouldn't win American Idol.\n\n01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:08.000\nYou need to listen to a whole album before you realize they're worth it.\n\n01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000\nThen we'll start playing D&D.\n\n01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:14.000\nAre you going to be Mitch Nightblade or whatever your name was?\n\n01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:24.000\nI was close, wasn't I?\n\n01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:31.000\nSpencer, if you could do us the honor of picking the race and class of the characters,\n\n01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000\nyou don't have to name them.\n\n01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000\nWe'll name them.\n\n01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:38.000\nRob Schraber's having a heart attack.\n\n01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:43.000\nSo then part of our show next week is maybe you'll present the characters next week?\n\n01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:46.000\nI have no idea what's going on. I'm all for it.\n\n01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000\nI know I'm going to win.\n\n01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:52.000\nCome to next week's Harmontown with your satchels and your dice.\n\n01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:56.000\nI have a feeling there's a lot of Dungeon Masters out there in Los Angeles,\n\n01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:59.000\nand I think all of them listen to this podcast.\n\n01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000\nYes, we do.\n\n01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000\nI know all of them.\n\n01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000\nAll right, well, thank you, Spencer, for...\n\n01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:09.000\nSpencer, everyone.\n\n01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:13.000\nI trust Spencer...\n\n01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:16.000\nI trust Spencer to say third edition is the way to go.\n\n01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000\nI don't know, man.\n\n01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:21.000\nWhen I was a kid, there were no editions.\n\n01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:26.000\nMy Dungeon Masters guide had melted wax on the inside cover\n\n01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:29.000\nand just all kinds of notes and maps,\n\n01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:32.000\nbecause everyone felt like you were this close to worshiping the devil.\n\n01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:36.000\nIt was punk rock. It was cool.\n\n01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:40.000\nAll you people care about is fucking inception. That's all you care about.\n\n01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000\nThat's your Dungeons & Dragons.\n\n01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000\nBecause if you think about it...\n\n01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:48.000\nNo, if you think about it, a troll could be a paladin.\n\n01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000\nThat's mind-blowing.\n\n01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:54.000\nA dream and a dream. That's a six-year-old could say that.\n\n01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000\nOh, no.\n\n01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000\nWe're running wailing.\n\n01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000\nI've never played Dungeons & Dragons.\n\n01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:03.000\nWe had one abortive attempt to try to play it as a doll,\n\n01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:04.000\nand it failed miserably.\n\n01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000\nWho's the Dungeon Master? I'm the worst.\n\n01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000\nIt didn't work. We didn't like it.\n\n01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:13.000\nAlso, I went out and played crappy pitch-and-putt golf with Matt Gorley yesterday,\n\n01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:16.000\nand we invited you, but you were playing Minecraft,\n\n01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000\nwhich I also don't see the allure.\n\n01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000\nIt's the best. I can't explain that now.\n\n01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000\nYou're talking about another three-hour podcast.\n\n01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000\nThank you, sir.\n\n01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000\nMinecraft.\n\n01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000\n1.31.\n\n01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000\nWas it Mitch Nightblade or something?\n\n01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:34.000\nJim Nightblade. I don't want to...\n\n01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000\nAll right. We will see you next week.\n\n01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000\nWe're going to get this settled.\n\n01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000\nThank you for coming to Harmontown, everybody.\n\n01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000\nYou guys have been tremendous.\n\n01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000\nThank you for coming.\n\n01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000\nDo you get the people to thank?\n\n01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000\nI can find it.\n\n01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000\nYeah, let's pull them up.\n\n01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000\nI should have had that up.\n\n01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000\nI can find it right now, the thank-yous.\n\n01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000\nHold up.\n\n01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000\nKeep it down, Olivia Newton-John.\n\n01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000\nAll right. Thanks once again, everybody.\n\n01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000\nWe want to thank Katie Levine for audio recording.\n\n01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000\nZac McKeever, our tech...\n\n01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000\nEmily Gordon, producing the live show.\n\n01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000\nDaniel Kramer, program director.\n\n01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000\nDustin Marshall, podcast producer.\n\n01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000\nMo Fatulbab, on-site director.\n\n01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000\nAnd Jenny Fine, our fantastic artist.\n\n01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000\nThank you so much for coming to NerdMelt.\n\n01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000\nAlso, thank you for listening out there in podcast land.\n\n01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000\nGo and prosper.\n\n01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000\nThank you so much.\n\n01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:28.000\nThank you so much.\n\n","cpu_time":["0.003s"],"str_size":[118941]}
